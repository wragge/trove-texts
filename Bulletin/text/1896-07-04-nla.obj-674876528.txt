THIS Company is being formed to acquire gold minin leases Nos. 1981 e, 2394 e, and 489 e compris-
ing 30 acres and situated near the Red Lake, 13 m es EiN. E. of White: Feather north of and
almost adjoining the well-known General Gordon Mine, block of 12 acres intervening. The latter
block is being privately worked by an English Syndicate; its recent purchasers.
The property has been inspected by Messrs. G. R. F ,rby, M.E. ; N. W. Harper, Manager White
Feather Main Reefs and Robinson Gold Mines, Limited Leslie A. Norman, M.A. I.M.E. ; and C.
Tregear, M.E., whose reports are appended.
It will be seen by reference to these reports that the lode formation is identical with that of the
General Gordon and outcrops on the property. The forn i,tion is a highly ferruginous chlorite schist,
containing vugs of gossany iron, and with numerous quai r. veins running through it carrying very rich
gold. In the General Gordon the formation is 35 feet kvi e ; in the Extended it lias been proved at
over 20 feet wide, with no trace of a second wall, and the rold is equally distributed throughout.
Running along the lode on the east side is a dyke'of granite porphyry, which has apparently eon-
dls, and which slpuld take the lode down with it. This may
centrated the lode within well-defined walls,
be taken as an indication of its permanency in depth.
The Red Lake is reported to have a permanent suppl of water in the driest seasons, suitable for
milling and reachable in easy sinking. There is abundaf eof timber for mining purposes, and as the
railway is now nearing Kalgoorlie the mine is within 24 n [es of the temporary terminus.
.£7500 will be placed to the credit of working capital, jss brokerage of 3d. per share.
An agreement dated 17th day of June, 1896, has 1 en. signed between Randolph Bedford, of
Adelaide, and William Arthur Kingsborough, on beha of the proposed Company, and can be
inspected at the Solicitor’s offices, Pirie-street, Adelaide
Upon the formation of the Company a meeting of he Allottees of Shares will be held for the
purpose of passing the Memorandum and Articles of Ai ociation, and the election of Directors, &c.
Dated at Adelaide, this 20th day of June, 1896.

LITERARY NOTES .
Recent Verse.
Everybody with a nice sense of words and
a jealous regard for standards draws two
distinct lines between
POETRY
“ . . there is a great gulf fixed.”—
Luke xvi., 26.
VERSE.
Yerse is the kind of thing that anyone may
write with a certain amount of culture and a
certain amount of pains : Poetry is the other
kind of thing. And the gulf is always there —
wide, narrow, deep, shallow —still, a gulf.
Poeta nascitur, poetilla fit. Perhaps at su-
preme crises of existence—first love, father-
hood, motherhood, the death of dear ones—the
poetilla may overpass the gulf, distribute sis
obnoxious middle, and for a moment gain
foothold on the farther verge as true Poeta
But this is rare ; and even so one seems to
discern the artificial stimulus, to note the
lack of native spontaneity. It is the differ-
ence between the bubbling spring and the
artesian bore, between beauty unadorned and
beauty manicured, cosmetiqued, and dressed
by Worth. Of the verser’s highest efforts
you can say at once, “This is fine! ” —of the
Poet’s you cannot say it, because you feel it
so. Certainly, after the nuptials, when
satiety has dulled the fragrance of passion, it
becomes possible for the critic to look a
poet in the feet, and point out the Ungraces.
But during the honeymoon, at all events, a
Poet drowns criticism in sympathy.
* * * *
Nevertheless, the proud name of Poet is
arrogated by the meanest maligner of the
rural Muse—the person who desires to know
whether The Bulletin pays for poems in
praise of Miss Jones, of Budgereeboola,
commencing—
To the homes of the sick and the feeble she went;
Undaunted and firm on her purp -se was bent;
The dogs Wert- all glad, they left their old bones
To give a reception to our heroine, Miss .Jones—
and winding up with
The ark wm-ti prepared foretold a great sea;
The angels at odom told Lot for to flee ;
The sea and tin- tempest, that dangerous gale,
Commanded old Jonah, and so did the whale.
So it is pleasant, in the push of pretentious
personalities, to meet a modest little pamph-
let of “Yerse: by James Hebblethwaite,
Hobart,” which yet includes lines whose
melody, and simplicity, and flavour, might
well claim the higher title. Could Heine,
for ewimple, wish a better ballad-begmning
than this :
Once as I lay a-sleeping
Beneath an ancient oak,
There slipt to me a maiden —
One of the sylvan folk.
Pale-sweet her face as moonbeam;
Her hair’s clear dewy tips
Fell on each side in darkness;
She kissed my dreaming lips.
Or this :
Faint winds are sadly sighing
Within the ruined shrine,
The rose of day is dying
To twilight in'the vine.
On bluest ether glowing,
Above a cold greeD steep,
A trembling star is sowing
The seeds of folding sleep.
And is there no Shakespenan grace in this
slight song :
Like the scent of violet,
Subtly sweet with all regret,
Love and Spring they pass away—
Ah me, weli-a-day !
Vesper-bell knells dying beam,
Form and feature fall to dream,
Gone the voice, the love of May—
Ah me, well-a-day !
Sigh we for the sunlight fled,
Sigh wr for the love that’s dead,
Love and violet decay—
Ah me, well-a-day !
* * * *
“A languid bard” Mr. Hebb waite
calls himself in lines addressed “To A. B.
Paterson,” of whom :
None out a poet could have tuned the vague far
overword
That haunts the lines that tell the tale of Conroy’s
travelling herd—
O phantom mob of men and sheep that drift the
north-west way !
My heart still follows in your track along the
Castlereagh.
“The vague far overword”—it is a phrase
which kernels the charm of Mr. Hebble-
thwaite’s own verses. There is a note of
weakness in them ; a sadness as of chill
twilight airs when one camps, solitary, on
some great Western plain : the writer’s pinion
is neither very strong nor very steady, and it
is rare to find eight lines without a flaw :
yet there is somefliing in the sentiment and
cadences which justifies the opinion here
set down—that they are some of the most
essentially poetic verses ever printed in our
country. All carry echoes from the elder
sons of song, yet even in their likeness Mr.
Hebblethwaite’s individuality and variety
are apparent. Already he has brought a
suggestion of Heine, of Shakespeare : is
there not a quaint, decadent, Verlainish
touch in this
The word “ sansculotte,” which the French
Revolution applied in an altered sense, was first
coined by the Abbe Maury, who used it of some
ladies in the gallery of the Assembly. (The
reader will note that the joke about the New
Woman does not follow here as se anticipated.)
“ A Castaway of the Barrier,” by David
J. Falk, of Adelaide, is a fine sample ®f worth-
less wordspinning. A New Caledonian escapee
drifts ashore at Cairns and makes love to a local
girl, who decides she will run away with him, and
then decides she won’t run away with him. Those
are the book’s ideas : the rest is fustian verbiage,
c.fA
It came to her she knew not how or when, in the sough
of the wind, in the breathing of the sea, in the'glamour
of the moonlight, in the radiance of the tropic sun. Her
w arm nature during that week unconsciously imbibed a
new life, quivered with new emolions, trembled to a new
influence; and before she, in her ignorance, knew what
I his freshly-awakened feeling was, she loved, and loved
with all the undisciplined force of her nature.
Blow the undisciplined force of her nature !
Sampson Low, Marston and Co. publish-at
6s. an English edition of J. D. Hennessey’s
“The Dis-Honourable, ” a local novel which con-
tains remarkably plain references to the swindles
of a former Q. governing ring. Mr. Hennessey, a
busy little journalist who was formerly a Wesleyan
clergyman, has three or four other stories in
print or preparing.
;f * * * *
“When I first began journalism,” said
John Morley recently, “ a London morning paper
reviewed a book casually—once in half a year;
now one of its most popular features is a careful
suiyey of all the work done in literature, art, and
music.” And can it be said that the new culture-
width implies loss of depth ?
THE CHILDREN’S MINUET.
Ah ! ah ! this is our holiday ;
Trip it with laughter again ;
Then gracefully bending in inode that is olden
We’ll dance to the minuet’s strain.
Slow ! slow ! silent and courteous —
White satin and powder and rose ;
And sad the refrain that floats dreamily over
Sweet maidens and stately young beaux.
See ! see ! just for a moment
The old world is with you again;
And now they have vanished and we are but
children
That dance to the minuet’s strain.
To quote all the good things would be almost
to quote the booklet: to show Mr. Hebble-
thwaite’s stronger manner take some stanzas
of which, with small alteration, Matthew
Arnold (another comparison !) would not be
ashamed :
ULYSSES.
The wise Ulysses stands upon the stair,
His wave-worn raft sways idly at his feet;
To lift the drooping sail there blows no air,
And all around is stillness, save the beat
Of faintest ripples that make cool the heat
With cool lipped sound, and on the ocean floor
Of weed-grown rock, flit golden shadows fleet,
Uid in the surgy murmurs evermore
Ulysses hears a dirge from happy days of yore.
He sees the grey and windless olive woods
Upon the smooth green shoulder of the hill;
He hears the tumbling of the rough green floods
That smite the shore and all the pebbles thrill
With glad stern motion in the seething mill;
But salt-green surge, green sward, and olive tree
Grow dreamlike, and his eyelids slowly fill,
And fainter falls the rumor of the sea,
For memory’s lingering voice now names Penelope.
In silent sunshine lies eaoh winding street,
Nor is there movement either high or low;
He hears no voice, no sound of any feet,
And all the soft blue air is in a glow
From somedivinest wellspring’s overflow
Of tender bliss, and in the rainbow dew,
And on the statue’s limbs of carved snow,
And on the columned marble’s peachy hue,
The glad young morning light trembles and blooms
anew.
O hush ! speak not! but list that silvery sound
Of flutes, and pipes, and merry clashing din,
And cry of sweet clear voices, floating round
The temple porch—-O, can it be a sin
To think Apollo and liis shining kin
Have left the glittering mount? In colored weeds
They slowly loiter past where keen and thin
The hot light cleaves the ebon shade—who leads
This train of tender youth fresh from the flowery
meads.
The scattered buds a dainty pathway leave,;
From arks and lapfuls that the children bring
Faint haunting gales of sylvan sweetness breathe—
As shyly sweet is one young blue-eyed thing !
The wise Ulysses yearns to feel her cling
About his childless neck, and with them roam
Beneath the rain of garlands, hear them sing
In ravished harmony : “Spring ! Spring ! is come,
Ah ! leave the house of stone, the sweet earth is
your home.”

COUGHS, COLDS ON THE CHEST, BRON-
CHITIS AND ASTHMA RAPIDLY
CURED BY Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure.
Those who have taken this medicine are amazed
at its wonderful influence. Sufferers from any
form of bronchitis, distressing cough, difficulty of
breathing, hoarseness, pain or soreness in the
chest, experience delightful and immediate relief,
and to those who are subject to colds on the chest)
it is invaluable, as it effects a complete cure. _ It
is most comforting in allaying tickling and irrita-
tion in the throat, and giving strength to the voice,
and it never allows a cough or asthma to become
chronic. No house should be without it, as, taken
at the beginning, a dose is generally sufficient,
and a complete cure is certain.
“Mr. W. G. HEARNE.—Dear Sir,—Your medicine has
cured me of bronchitis and asthma, from which I suffered
for upwards of seven years, during which period I was
scarcely ever free from coughs, and frequently the diffi-
culty of breathing was so distressing that for nights in
succession I had to sit up. I write you this acknowledg-
ment from a sense of duty, as in my case every other
treatment had failed. For a year previous I had been
getting very much worse, and at the time I obtained yqur
medicine I was confined to bed suffering from a most
violent cough, expectorating blood and matter, and
apparently beyond hope of recovery. The first dose of
the medicine gave me welcome relief, and I steadily
improved as I continued the treatment, until I became,
as I am now, quite well. —Yours sincerely, H. WALKER,
Balmain, Sydney.”
“ My son, sixyears old, had bronchitis for 12 months.
The noise in throat and along back of lungs, and the
cough, caused me great anxiety. I tried several treat-
ments. Cough mixtures and poultices were used and
plasters were applied to the back and chest without
success. . .
“ I bought a large-size bottle of Hearne’s Bronchitis
Cure, and after my boy had taken this medicine for about
10 days he was perfectly cured. —J. PATTERSON,
Solicitor, Tamworth, N.S.W.”
“ We, the undersigned, have had occasion to obtain
Hearne’s Bronchi!is Cure, and we certify that it is per-
fectly and rapidly successful under circumstances which
undoubtedly prove its distinct healing power.”—Signed
by Rev. JOHN SINCLAIR, Myers-street, Geelong, and
59 other leading residents.

PREMIER OINTMENT in the SOUTHERN

have lately made New South Wales their home, it
may be as well to let them know that there is such
an article as JOSEPIISON’S OINTMENT purely

indigenous to the country and nowhere else, the
principal of which is the EUCALYPTUS, now
so famed thoroughout the world.

using it. You are at liberty to use this if you feel
disposed.

Row’s Assorted Bitters
CONTAIN
Row’s Dandelion Bitters.
We recommend these BITTERS to be taken
two or three times a day; a wineglassful for an
adult, smaller quantity for children.
For General Debility, Dyspepsia, Rheumatism,
and Cutaneous Affections.
The action of dandelion, more especially upon
the liver and kidneys, is more reliable for remov-
ing all impure secretions than any otiier medicinal
plant known.
Persons suffering from Skin diseases will find
these Bitters invaluable.
DIRECTIONS FOR USE.
One wineglass two or three times a day after
meals diluted with same quantity of water. For
young people about half the quantity twice a day.
They Purify the Blood and Liver.
See what a Medical Gentleman says
about them.
Messrs. E. Row and Co.
With thanks for forwarding me a bottle of your
Row’s Dandelion Bitters, and consider them most
excellent, and superior to many others that I have
previously tried. Yours faithfully, HENRY

Baron Berzilins’^
’ — 1 — Buchu Bitters.
BARON BERZILIUS’ REPORT.
They are chiefly given in complaints of the Urinary
Organs, such as Gravel, Chronic Catarrh, morbid Irrita-
tion of the Bladder and Urethra, Diseases of the Prostrate
Glands, and Retention or Inconvenience of Urine, from
the loss of tone in the parts concerned in its evacuation.
These Bitters I also recommend in Dyspepsia, in Chronic
Rheumatism and Cutaneous affections. The action of
Buchu on the human frame is more effectual on all
diseases of the Kidneys and Bladder than any other herbal
plant; and it also assists persons suffering from Skin
Diseases, causing a healthy action of the secretions and
inducing perspiration.
Read, what Medical men say about them
BJERKIN, M.D.: —The Bitter is pure, and not like
others in overdoses. It has a remarkable influence on the
liver, promoting the secretions of Bile, and correcting it
when deranged, and restores healthy evacuations in oases
of habitual costiveness.
D. ECKSTROM, M.D.—BBBB—I find these Bitters a
most valuable and wholesome tonic, being pure and
strengthening ; a stimulant to the liver, assisting diges-
tion. I therefore thus recommend them.
G. B. WOOD, M.D.—lt is the purest of Bitters, and
exerts a peculiar influence over the liver.
Row’s Steane’s Bitters.
s
TUDY HEALTH BY TAKING ROW’S
STEANE’S BITTERS.
Ihe great demand throughout the colony for
these pure Bitters shows they are superior to all
others and equalled By none.
Facts Speak Louder than Words.
Read this sworn testimony from a well-known
citizen:—
( Statutory Declaration.
I, George Hewett, do hereby solemnly and
sincerely declare as follows:
‘'l hat I feel it a duty I owe to the public to
state that I have been suffering for many years
from weakness of the stomach, so called INDI-
GESTION or DYSPEPSIA, and have been cured
by my taking two or three glasses of ROW’S
STEANE’S BITTERS a day in a little water, and
1 hope others suffering" from the same complaint
will be as speedily cured.
“(Signed) G. HEWETT,
“ 215 Pitt-streeb.
Row’s You’ll Do Bitters.
All who suffer from Chest Complaints, Cold, Coughs
and general weakness of the Lungs, will gain more ease
and comfort from a wineglass of ROW'S YOU’LL DO
BITTERS than any cough medicine tried before.
Row’s Pepsine Bitters.
All who suffer from Weak Digestion will soon
be cured by these Bitters, taken three times a day
before meals.
Row’s Oriental Bitters.
A Splendid General Tonic, with a tumbler of
water makes a drink equal to any best Champagne.
Row’s Steane's Wine
a safe and sure stimulant for the female sex or
children, for it raises and strengthens depressed
systems without producing a temporary excite-
ment to be followed by greater depression.
Persons suffering from loss of appetite and
eneral depression of spirits cannot do better than
ROW’S STEANE’S WINE.
It cannot harm you, but must do good to all
delicate persons. Young Ladiks can take this
when suffering from general debility. It’s only a
pure tonic. Try it. J

of the money in your pocket, and take account
of the many stores whose various attractions
are laid before you. There is A, with temp-

B, whose wiles are innumerable ; and C,

Oh 1 who was it saddled White Star, 1 st night,
And who was it saddled White Star
You can read his track to the rails and back
And down the creek ever se far ;
Oh ! moonlight is lovers’ light, somebody knows,
And witch-time the season to woo,
And down in the bend where the kurrajong grows
The tracks have been trodden by two.
Oh ! who was it galloped White Star, last night,
When gold stars jewelled the sky ?
You can see the brand of saddle and band
In sweat that is clotted and dry ;
Oh ! somebody raced, with the world asleep,
To a tryst that somebody knew,
And over the blue-grass fetlock-deep
The white hoofs scattered the dew.
Oh ! who was it fastened White Star, last night,
To a bough of the kurrajong-tree ?
The deep-set grooves of his restless hooves
Are there for the world to see ;
Oh ! somebody left him for true love’s sake,
And somebody left him long,
For horses may hunger and bridles break
When true love fashions her song !
Oh ! who was it fondled White Star last night
When somebody whispered adieu,
And plaited the gray of his mane in a way
That never those gray locks grew ?
And who was it bent from his saddle-bow
To the plea of an upturned face,
While down in the bend where the kurrajongs
grow
The world stood still for a space ?
Oh ! the lover who saddled White Star last night
It is very easy to guess,
For his face is bright with a new-found light
And a joy that his eyes confess.
Oh ! somebody met in the moonlight snow,
Someone that cared to be kissed,
I And the veriest dolt in the world may know
Who rode to the moonlight tryst!

JACK CARDUE.
There’s a big soul sails through the dark to-night,
Tried and solid and true ;
A soul that was never afraid to fight—
The soul of Jack Cardue.
His style was never the fancy style,
His creed might not fit you,
And you’d find that you’d struck a raspy file
If you argued with Jack Cardue.
His talk would make clergymen die of shock, (
Though his folks were for “ Church and Light,
And he didn’t invest in teetotal stock,
But, oh ! his heart was white.
He stuck to his folks from birth to grave,
And when burst banks hit him bad
He didn’t go cursing the world or rave
Or otherwise play the cad ;
He didn’t throw up the sponge and weep ;
He didn’t a moment shirk ;
He simply remarked —“Well, boys, less sleep,
And a big bit more of work ! ”
Yet the only epitaph they gave him
When his soul went West by Bast—
Oh ! my arm got hard and my eyes went dim—
Was “ a drunken, selfish beast ! ”•
Jack would always take another s turn,
And he always felt for you,
When the whole wide world seemed to crush and
burn,
And the future looked Prussian-blue,
You had only to say,_“ Here’s a big J pen,
A blotter, a pot of ink,
A cosy fire and a quiet den,
And a bottle of beer to drink!
Ah. I know when his wisp of life was spun,
There flashed through the winter night—
“ St. Peter, Heaven. Heart 1 Lloyd s Ai;
With care; for it’s, oh, so white / ”
And I’ll bet when, after life’s ups and downs,
Jack reaches heavenly things,
He’ll growl if they offer him sapphire crowns,
And haloes and robes and wings,
“ I’ve got no use for those damned fal-lals 5
All I want to give is a spurt
To any of my old earth-time.pals,
And I’ll do it in pants and shirt!
And he’ll turn to the Angel of Records then,
And his ink-marked hand enjoy,
And he’ll sav, “ Here’s at least one brother pen !
Can I give you a lift, old boy ?

SATURDAY, JULY 4, 1896.
The Newcastle Strike.
The Newcastle (N.S.W.) coal-strike has
dragged along for over three months, and, up
to date, there are no prospects save the
prospect that things, which are now bad
enough, may shortly be a great deal
worse. As for the merits of the case,
they were very difficult to sort out, even
at the beginning, and they have grown no
less complex as time went on. Also the
original merits or demerits of the quarrel
have been complicated by the addition of
new factors to the old problem, which problem
was sufficiently aggravated without them.
The first cause of the trouble was undoubtedly
the miserably inadequate wages paid to the
miners, whose condition has been steadily
deteriorating for several years past, until it
has become so wretched as to be almost past
endurance. The cause of the low wages was
partly the greed of the mine-owners and their
hunger for large dividends, hut this consti-
tuted only a small part of the difficulty ; the
owners are doubtless as hungry for big divi-
dends as they ever were, but of late cir-
cumstances have been against them, and their
profits have been comparatively moderate.
The other cause, and by far the more im-
portant one, has been the absurdly low price
of coal, which lias gone down of late to a
figure never before known on the Hunter
Itiver coalfields. The reasons of this exces-
sive cheapness are many and widespread, but
they seem to resolve themselves mainly into
over-production, brought about by a variety
of circumstances.
* * * *
New South Wales turns out annually more
than twice as much coal as the province
requires for local consumption. Therefore it
depends mostly on its export trade. In the
good old days, when coal realised about twice
as much per ton as it does at present, New
South Wales had almost a monopoly of the
Victorian, Californian and Chilian trade, as
well as that of many other countries. There-
fore a stupendous effort was made to open
mines in any and every place where coal was
procurable, and to tear out all the interior of
the province at once and sell it by the ton to
all-comers. In those days it w r as assumed,
as it always is, that the monopoly would last
for ever. No one foresaw that coal-fields
would be developed in Japan, British
Columbia and Victoria, or that Maoriland
would begin to bid for the South American
trade, or that the Jap. would annex Formosa
and bring its coal-measures into the general
competition, or that any of the things which
have happened would ever come to pass.
These results were brought about partly by
mismanagement and partly by the ordinary
course of events. During the good times
that are gone wages and dividends were both
higher than they now are, and both miners
and owners kicked on smaller provocation.
The owners tried to reduce wages on the
ground that they were not getting sufficient
profits at a time when their profits were so
large that the shareholder of to-day would
regard them as gorgeous affluence ; and
disastrous strikes were the result. The
miners demanded more wages when their
pay was higher than the highest figure they
now hope for, and more disastrous strikes
were the consequence. The owners certainly
were the chief offenders, but there was mis-
management and bad judgment on both
sides.
The natural consequence of all this was
that prices were high. Freights both by sea
and rail were also high in those days. The
former were high from various causes ; the
latter because the railways had to charge
heavy rates to make interest on the exorbi-
tant cost of construction (mainly brought
about by land-resumptions at absurd rates)
and to make up for extravagant management.
Therefore, coal was enormously expensive to
the distant consumer, and this led to the
eager search for coal-measures in Gippsland
and elsewhere. The Victorian discoveries
wrecked New South Wales’s best foreign
market, for, although large quantities of coal
still go to Victoria, it is at a very different
price from that realised before southern com-
petition set in. The Gippsland fields would,
doubtless, have been opened up sooner or
later in any case—but the high prices charged
by the New South Wales owners certainly
hurried on their development. The same
causes helped along the competition of Japan
and Maoriland and British Columbia. Now
the great and profitable monopoly is practi-
cally at an end, and nothing that can be done
is.ever likely to re-establish it. Also, China
may have to be reckoned with in the future
as another element of disaster. China lias
deposits of coal that are, by all report, prac-
tically illimitable, and has cheaper labor than
even Japan ; and if the European gets a firm
footing in that country, which he seems cer-
tain to do sooner or later, and opens up its
coal-fields, which also seems certain sooner
or later, the competition, which is sufficiently
active now, will grow even more severe.
* * * *
Cheapness, according to the Foreign-trade
doctrine, is the great desideratum—the chief
purpose and end of man—the cause of all
prosperity—the thing to be aimed at above
all others. Yet in this case the benefit is
not at all apparent. The cheapness of New
South Wales coal has reduced the profits on
the capital engaged in the industry, and has
caused a lot of capital—invested in mines
which were not well-adapted for cheap work-
ing—to yield no interest at all, while the
principal is abandoned to rust and decay.
It has thrown many coal-miners out of work,
and has starved the rest, along with their
wives and families. Through them it has
helped to starve the shopkeepers and others
who live by supplying the miners with neces-
saries, and their families, and the people
who are dependent on them, and the families
of these dependents. And, though coal lias
become cheaper to the consumer, this cheap-
ness has not led to the creation of new in-
dustries on any scale worth mentioning, nor
to any perceptible alleviation of the general
poverty, nor has it conferred much visible
benefit on anybody. The Foreign-trade
policy certainly did not create the cheapness
of coal—it arrived through circumstances
with which no fiscal system was actively con-
cerned ; but the fact that its arrival has done
harm rather than good casts a serious doubt
on the beautiful doctrine of cheapness in all
its branches.
* * * *
The present situation looks about as hope-
less as it very well can he. The coal in-
dustry, apparently, can’t pay living wages at
the prices now prevailing. It certainly could
pay higher wages than it does, but even at the
best it couldn’t at present pay such wages as
would enable the miner and his family to
maintain a decent standard of existence.
If the prices are raised to any extent
worth mentioning, in the face of the
foreign competition which now exists, and
the lower wage paid in many of the compet-
ing countries, and the fact that many of
them are more conveniently situated in the
matter of markets, it would seem that the
foreign trade, which constitutes more than
half of the business, would vanish altogether.
In one sense, of course, there is no visible
reason why it should not be allowed to
vanish. There is no special cause why New
South Wales should break its heart and
spend its immortal soul in tearing all its
visible coal-supply out of the ground imme-
diately, and selling it abroad at ruinous
prices at this particular juncture. The coal
will be as good 100 or 200 or 500 years
hence ; it will all be wanted in course of
time to supply the wants of Australia’s
groiving population, with its possibilities of
almost unlimited increase ; and by dragging
it out of the earth in such red-hot haste
just now Australia is only hastening the ad-
vent of a possible period when it may have
to buy coal abroad to make up for the d ;ple-
tion of its own resources. If the price was
put up to a figure which would cover decent
wages to the- workers and moderate interest
on the capital invested, the foreign trade
might go, but the local demand ought to
supply a respectable rate of pay to perhaps
half the miners now employed and leave the
aggiegate owner no worse off than lie is
at present. Unfortunately, the half of the
mining community which would thus he
thrown out would he driven by abso-
lute want to under-cut the other half. There
is no other industry which can absorb them
and pay even the wretched wages they now
earn. There is no prospect, in this era when
foreign imports are making the local worker
more and more superfluous, of any such in-
dustry arising. There is no prospect, either,
of any manufactures starting to increase the
local coal-demand, because the tendency of
the Foreign-trade policy is to wipe out. local
manufactures for the encouragement of pro-
tected German imports brought here cheaply
per subsidised European steamers. More-
over, if the price was raised to such a rate as
would yield decent profits and decent wages,
not only would the foreign trade he lost, but
it remains to he seen whether, under the
new.conditions, and by virtue of the great
Free-raid policy, some subsidised foreigner
might not begin to compete even in the
Sydney market.
* * * *
To sum the situation up in a few sentences :
There are more coal-mines and miners in New
South Wales than the industry, under present
conditions, cm support. There is no pro-
spect of a diminution in the number of miners,
for there is no other employment for them,
and even the meanest wage is a shade better
than absolute starvation. There is no pro-
spect of a diminution in the number of mines,
because the capitalist regards even 2 per
cent, profit, gained by further overcrowding
an already glutted m irket and further starv-
ing his already starving employes, as better
than no profit at all. There is no immediate
prospect of a rise in prices which will alle-
viate the distress, because foreign competi-
tion is apparently becoming more instead of
less aggravated, and the great importing
policy does nothing to encourage a local
demand. The Newcastle miners struck for
higher wages, which course was fully justified
by their truly miserable situation. The
owners refused, which course was partly jus-
tified in some cases by the smallness of their
present profits. They offered at first to let
the miners resume work at the old, abject
rate of pay, and the offer was rejected ; now
that the employes are willing to accept it the
owners demand the practical abolition of the
unions, which is wholly unjustifiable, and a
further reduction of wages on the ground
that the strike has driven away much of what
trade remains, and made the previously bad
state of things even worse. What truth
there may he in this assertion no one really
knows, but it certainly looks like a brutaliy-
unfeeling attempt to take advantage of an
opponent’s distresses to the very utmost.
The depression which prevailed before the
strike is an advantage to the owners and a
tremendous handicap to the men. It practi-
cally beggared the unions, so that there are
no funds to keep the strikers from absolute
starvation. And whereas the owner, who
was making 50 per cent, on his capital in the
old days, was in red-hot haste to get his
mine at work again because the loss of 50
per cent, profit was a serious matter, the
owner who now makes perhaps 5 per cent,
doesn’t care so much because the loss is a
much smaller affair.
There is no prospect of bringing about a
satisfactory settlement by State interference,
because no amount of State interference can
alter the question of Japanese and other
competition abroad, and it is on the foreign
trade that the coal industry has principally
depended. Also, no interference which is
compatible with the principles of a Foreign-
trade Government would improve the local
demand, or find other employment for the
superfluous miners. There is no apparent
solution in the idea of making the coal-mines
State property. Even if the State took them
over at a reasonable valuation, and only
required them to provide, over and above
working expenses, 5 per cent, interest and
sinking-fund on the amount invested, it
could not apparently pay a white man’s wage
to the workers in the present circumstances,
unless it was content to make coal-mining a
subsidised industry, and charge the shortage
to the revenue. The problem moves in a
vicious circle, and brings up against a dead
wall everywhere. It had its beginning away
back further than most people now alive can
remember, and its end, apparently, is in the
future further away than anyone can foresee.
The Freetrade theory in such cases is t hat,
when an industry doesn’t pay, the people—
or, at least, the superfluous people—engaged
in it should resort to “something else.”
Unfortunately, there is nothing else, and no
prospect of it. In all the industrial history
of New South Wales there is nothing more
piteous than the present situation of the
Newcastle miners—and nothing more hope-
less.
The Black Sheep of Australia.
In a recent pamphlet on the subject of Federa-
tion, J. C. Drake, a Q. politician who, with
apparently many of a leader’s qualities, has
hitherto somehow failed to become more than a
nominal leader, emphasises The Bulletin’s
expectation that the existing Queensland Govt,
ring would never consent to federate upon a
Democratic basis. That expectation is now
realised. In terms of the resolution of last
year’s Premiers’-eonference, the Parliaments of
New South Wales, Vic! >ria, S.A. and Tasmania
have passed Acts providing that the whole
body of provincial electors shall choose repre-
sentatives to a Convention for drafting anew a
Federal Constitution. Queensland, the black
sheep of Australia, the tainted wether of the
provincial flock, proposes that its delegates to
the task of building the Australian nation
shall have a unique distinction—they shall be
elected, not by the people, not by the electors,
but by its corrupt and Govt.-ridden House of
Assembly.
* * * *
It is true that, at the Premiers’-couference at
Hobart, on Jan. 31, ’95, Queensland Premier
Nelson voted for the carried resolution pro-
viding that representatives of each province
should be “ directly chosen by the electors.” It
is true that, on his return to Sydney, Premier
Nelson told the Sydney Daily Telegraph that
We were all agreed that the Convention should be
elected by popular vote. ... I don’t think we’re
likely to get a better Convention than by popular vote.
It is true that, on his return to Brisbane,
Premier Nelson told the Brisbane Courier
that he
had agreed to the election of delegates to the Federation
Convention, all present rights and privileges being
reserved to the electors,
and that, as that journal states, he gave it no
reason to suppose that he “ favoured the elec-
tion of delegates otherwise than by a national
vote.” By Premier Nelson, however, and by
the people who manage Premier Nelson, these
little discrepancies between past and present
are considered of no importance.
* » * +
Yet the conditions of the question have not
changed meanwhile. The necessity for popular
suffrage is obvious. No Australian House of
Assembly has been elected primarily or chiefly
to deal with Federation. Probably Federation
had no influence whatever upon the majority of
electors when choosing between candidates. In
Queensland, certainly, not one member of
Assembly was elected at the recent contest
because of his supposed fitness to deal with the
Federal subject. That contest hinged entirely
on local issues—Govt. v. Labor, party v. prin-
ciple, bribery v. no-bribery ; and so on. It is
absurd to say that persons chosen to deal with
purely local questions should become supreme
arbiters of the people’s wishes on national ques-
tions. With more reason Premier Nelson
might argue that Parliament should be elected
by the municipal councils.
* * * *
But the necessity for the change of front is
also obvious. Nobody supposes that Premier
Nelson is personally dishonest, but he works
in a dishonest political groove. At Hobart he
was out of his groove, and naturally saw the
right and chose it. When he returned to Bris-
bane, and got back in his groove, his managers
showed him that he had blundered. “ Our
attitude towards the people,” they reminded
him, “ is distrust tempered by fear. By popu-
lar election of Federal-Convention representa-
tives we gain nothing, yet stand to lose
everything. Quite conceivably the people may
return a majority of representatives to pledge
Queensland for the white man. We are pledged
to Queensland for the black man. National
union, popular progress, a white Australia, a
homogeneous race—these are figments. Cheap
colored labor is a reality. What asses we should
be to throw away the substance for the
shadow ! ” And Premier Nelson looked, and,
behold, he saw that it was good.
* * * *
It may seem strange that a Govt, which has
just returned triumphantly from a general elec-
tion should dread another reference to the people.
But the Govt, knows that the election was won
literally by the smell of an overdraft. It was
won, as The Bulletin has pointed out, by elec-
toral fraud, by electoral cajolery, by electoral
intimidation, by the employment of every dis-
honorable electoral artifice. Fraud is an un-
canny tool—you can never tell when it will
turn in your hand—and the Government
knows it. The existing Q. Parliament is
thoroughly misrepresentative of the people,
and the Government knows that too. No-
where has the gentle art of “ weeding the
rolls ” reached higher perfection than in Queens-
land. Here is a little table based on figures in-
judiciously supplied by Brisbane Courier, the
Govt, organ, with the approximate increase of
population credited monthly instead of yearly :
Date. Adult On Dis- Percent- Percent-
Males.* Rolls, fran- ajre on age Dis-
chised. Rolls, franchised
Dec., 1892 114,423 98,065 16,358 86 14
Election, 1893 115,386 86,983 28,403 75 25
Election, 1896 126,963 86,878 40,085 69 31
*Capable of voting— i.e., excluding Chinese, Poly-
nesians, and other Asiatic races ; prisoners, lunatics, and
members of charitable institutions.
An attractive little table, truly. The “purifi-
cation of the rolls ” entered on by Govt, at the
close of ’92 resulted in disfranchising 11,082
democratic voters in time for the election in
April, ’93, and the Govt, returned victorious.
By strict attention to business, Govt, actually
succeeded in reducing the number of voters
still further by the election of ’96, though the
adult male population increased by 11,577 in
the interim ! The nett result was that nearly
one-third of the adult male population was dis-
franchised, and Govt, returned to power again,
as it boasts, “stronger than ever.” It certainly
smells stronger than ever.
* * ♦ *
To a certainty, eight out of ten of the dis-
franchised electors are democrats; and the
wonder, under the circumstances, is not that
the Labor party did not do more, but that it
did so much. Here is a table of votes polled
at last election, based on Brisbane Courier
figures:—
82,298 votes in all elected 66 members in all (6 seats un-
contested).
41,836 Ministerial votes elected 37 members —average,
1130 votes per member.
29,268 Labor votes elected 19 members—average, 1540
votes per member.
7,062 Opposition votes elected 6 members—average, 1177
votes per member.
4,132 Independent votes elected 4 members—average,
1033 votes per member.
Thus the average Labor member represents 410
votes, or nearly half as many again, more than
the average Ministerial member ! If the Labor
party had its due share of representation on
the Ministerial basis, it would hold 26 seats in


stead of the 19 won at the polls. The Govt,
majority of seats represents a minority of votes,
and the Govt, knows it.
* * * *
For it must be remembered that the Courier
has cooked these figures by the inclusion
of contingent votes, which did not influence
a sinr/le election. And why cooked ? Because
nearly all the contingent votes given were given
for Govt, candidates : the Labor-electors did
not use them. Also, the Govt, tally is swollen
probably 25 per cent, by property-votes : the
Labor tally represents men. The actual number
of men who voted for the Govt, at last election
was probably under 30,000, out of an adult male
population of 127,000, whose will it professes
to represent ; and this is why Q. Govt, will
not trust the people to elect delegates to the
Federal Convention.
» * * *
The duty of Australia is clear. On the ques-
tion of the exclusion of aliens there must be
no compromise; and to the Federal Govt, must
be reserved absolute control. If Queensland
wishes to emulate the slave States of America,
we will reckon with Queensland as an enemy of
the nation. Let her stay without the Common-
wealth until she can elect to speak for her a
Government which is white inside.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
A Fiscal Referendum.
That, in the opinion of this House, the commercial and
financial unrest consequent upon the uncertainty of the
tenure of any fiscal policy calls for the immediate taking
of a plebiscite vote upon the advisability of the present
policy remaining unaltered for a period of five years ; that
in the event of a majority declaring themselves against
the present policy, and in favor of a protective tariff, im-
mediate action be taken to adjust the fiscal policy in
accordance with the wishes of the majority of the people.
—Motion by M‘Go wen, M.L.A., in N.S.W. Assembly.
The above motion, which, at time of writing,
was in a comatose condition on N.S.W.
Assembly notice-paper, suggests a lot of dis-
jointed reflections. No one knows what the
sentiments of New South Wales on the
fiscal issue, or any other single issue, really
are; political questions have been so mixed
up with each other, and with Parkes’s
hair, Dibbs’s <£looo and his K.C.M.G.-ship,
Lyne’s friend Waller, the Broken Hill strike,
the sectarian row, the 1893 crisis, and other
tilings, that there never has been a straight vote
on any tiling. The S.A. Referendum laid the
ghost of sectarian education, for the time at
least; it would be worth trying if a similar
device might nob, for a time, lay the liscal
ghost in N.S.W. AH the same there is no
special reason why this particular question
should be introduced now more than at any
other time, unless M‘Gowen, M.L.A., begins
to have qualms about his conduct in helping to
bring in Foreign-trade, and wants to lift the
load of responsibility off his shoulders on to
those of the people. And there is no reason
why there should be a fiscal referendum only ;
what the country wants is a general power
of referring important questions to a direct
popular vote. And there is also no reason
why the Referendum should settle the fiscal
question for five years more than for any
other period ; the vote of the male adult
population of to-day can’t bind the 60,000
or so of voters who will come of age
within the next five years, and the population
can’t prohibit itself from changing its mind
between now and 1901. All that can be done
is to enact that, when a question is once
decided by popular vote, no further referendum
shall be taken upon it for a certain period, and
five years is probably as good a period as any
other. Further, when Parliament starts con-
sidering M'Gowen’s motion it should at the
same time seriously ponder the question of the
election of Ministers by the Legislature. Ob-
viously, if the popular vote went for Protection,
Reid, the Freebrade apostle, is not the best
man to carry out the will of the nation in this
matter with any thoroughness or energy, or
to do his best to make the protective policy a
success. Yet the people don’t necessarily want
to exchange Reid for the other alternative,
Lyne, because they want a generally democra-
tic policy, and they strongly suspect Lyne
of being anything but democratic. The
spectacle of the people having a popular vote
and being only able to use it for the purpose of
ordering Reid to enact a Protectionist tariff, or
Lyne to establish a Single-tax regime, would
be a vast absurdity. If the people are to defi-
nitely dictate the items of the national policy,
they should also have a more distinct voice in
deciding who should carry out their policy.
At present, if the nation happens to want
Sleath and John Haynes and Nicholas
Willis as the principal parts of the Ministry,
it has no direct or even indirect means of say-
ing so. Moreover, if the fiscal ghost is referred
directly to the people, which is certainly the
best tiling to do with it, the question is not
merely one of “ the present fiscal policy ” on
one side and Protection on the other. It is the
triangular question of absolute Freetrade, which
New South Wales has never had ; and absolute
Protection, which it can hardly be said to have
ever had ; or a Revenue Tariff, which it has had
practically all the time and which the Reid
Government proposes to maintain with varia-
tions. The man who tries to reduce the fiscal
question to tw o issues doesn’t even begin to
understand what that question is.
Tne Melbourne Banking Prosecutions.
It is announced that the Victorian Government
intends to criminally prosecute certain of the
people who ran the late lamented City of Mel-
bourne Bank on the rocks. Undoubtedly, con-
sidering the awful smellsomeness of the defumt
institution, this is the right thing to do, if only
for the purpose of extracting more information
as to what became of the capital and oilier
assets which weren’t there when they were
wanted. Also it is the right thing to do, if
only to impress upon the public the awful need
of that new Companies Act which the many
directors of the Leg. Council so enthusiastically
rejected last session. But it is worth while
noting—so that the public won’t feel any more
disappointed than is absolutely necessary if the
acquittal comes along as usual, and so that no
>ne need profess to regard that acquittal, if
it comes, as a triumphant vindication of every-
body’s character —that in the present awful
state of Victorian and other law, quite a lot of
the things which wrecked the C.O.M. Bank
seem to be perfectly legal. The bank burst
partly because the late manager was allowed by
the board to have a huge overdraft without
security, and there is no law against that. It
got into difficulties partly also because the
directors, or some of them, lent the money of the
shareholders and depositors to each other on
insufficient security, and there is no law against
that either. It fooled away some more of its
customers’ money in buying its own shares to
prevent a panic on the market, and thereby
diminished its customers’ security by reducing
the callable capital, and that doesn’t seem to be
illegal as the law now stands —and as the Leg.
Council keeps it standing. The balance-sheet
made the dreadful bank appear, at a superficial
glance, to be perfectly sound ; it said that the
coin on hand, the capital, the stock of deben-
tures, and the amounts owing were so much,
which they were ; and it put down the biggest
asset —the one on which everything depended
as “ Advances £4,222,648,” which they were.
It didn’t mention that between <£1,000,000 and
.£2,000,000 of the advances were bad, nor did
it say definitely that they were good, and
apparently the law doesn’t clearly state that
this kind of concealment is unlawful at least,
it isn’t stated with such clearness as to be abso-
lutely definite. The auditors gave their certifi-
cate that the balance-sheet was correct, and so
apparently it was in the strictly legal sense ; it
said that the advances were £4,222,648, which
was a sad and dreadful fact, and it doesn t
appear at all certain that anything more is
demanded of an auditor. In a general way
it is understood by law that the directors
and the auditors and the balance-sheet
are to show the people interested the affairs of
the co., but whether the affairs of the co. were
or were not sufficiently shown by the true
statement that the advances were £4,222,648
doesn’t seem to be clearly specified by any
statute. If the balance-sheet had alleged that
the profit or loss shown was realised “ after
providing for bad and doubtful debts ” there
might have been a direct misrepresentation,
but the two last sheets, at all events, wisely
left out this statement, which is also left out of
a good many other documents of the same kind.
There is no law against leaving out this essential
statement. In a large, general, promiscuous way
there undoubtedly was gross misrepresentation
or gross negligence or gross fraud by somebody
—whether by the persons accused or by some
other persons—but it is a painful fact that
quite a number of the doings which ruined the
City of Melbourne Bank, and yet kept the
dreadful deficit from appearing in the balance-
sheet, are not specifically illegal—or not nearly
so much so as they should be. The Companies
Law is about the loosest and most rotten thing
in Victoria just now, and the Leg. Council is
keeping it that way.
How tlie Sharks Stick Together.
The Victorian inferior courts are just now all
at sea by reason of a recent decision by Chief
Justice Madden. Formerly there was a law in
Victoria by which, when a common or lay
citizen laid an information against anybody,
only the informant or his attorney or his ex-
pensive barrister could conduct the case before
the court of petty sessions. This was a
pleasant and profitable arrangement for the
attorney and the barrister, as the informant, in
most cases, lacked the legal knowledge to run
the case himself, and had to hire a costly limb
of the law to assist him. Then a custom arose
by which constables and police-inspectors, if
the case was a matter of public interest,
used to take it out of the hands of
the informant, provided he was agree-
able, and run the prosecution themselves.
This answered sufficiently well, as the ordinary
“cop” knows about enough law for petty
sessions purposes, and it saved much money,
and prevented many cases being dropped for
want of legal assistance. Also, it aggravated
the legal brigade considerably. Next, an Act
was passed authorising any member of the
police force to prosecute in the case of any
breach of the Police Offences Act, which seems
sufficiently comprehensive for all purposes.
Recently a number of tote-men were informed
upon by a private person ; the police prose-
cuted according to custom ; and the result was
a conviction of the entire batch. And now
Chief Justice Madden has turned the
whole lot loose on appeal, his reason
being that though the Act says police-
men may prosecute in any breach of a
certain law it doesn’t really mean that; it only
means that he may prosecute if he is also the
informant. There was no necessity, of course,
for such a law as Mr. Madden alleges this to
be, for the policeman had the power to serve
as informant and prosecutor without it, there-
fore it would have been just as reasonable to
pass an Act authorising the “trap” not to
interfere with the sun rising at the usual hour
in the morning. Also the limitation which
Mr. Madden put into the Act isn’t there ; the
clause is as comprehensive as any Legislature
could well make it, and about as clear as the
Australian language allows. But the C.J. is a
lawyer. The Vic. lawyers have long protested
against the police prosecution system which
deprives them of so much business and so many
fees. Every lawyer, from long habit of cursing
about his lost fees, has come to regard the
police interference as a lawless outrage, and
when Mr. Madden came to look at the matter
from a new point of view, lie seemingly found
the old point of view too strong for him. The
C.-J’s jerry-built decision will probably be law
in Victoria until overset by Act of Parliament,
and private informants who can’t hire lawyers
to run their cases are hereby warned off the
grass.
Agent-General Saul Samuel deserves cordial
thanks for having administered a long-deserved
snub—a smack with the flat of his tongue
to that utterly irresponsible clique of self-ad-
advertising Bigheads, self-styled the “ Colonial
Party ” in the British Commons. Australia
knows of no “ Colonial Party in the British
Legislature. The ’Ogans and the ’Enniker
’Eatons and the ’Oward Vincents have not a
feather’s weigh* of influence with, nor a
feather’s value of interest in, Australia as Aus-
tralia. They merely regard Australia as an
appanage of J. Bull. They are not a “Colo-
nial Party,” but a “Bull-Barnacle Party.”
Their attempted interference with Austra-
lian affairs is an impertinence, and would
be an insult if it ever produced any
result but wind. The “Three Tailors of
Tooley Street ” were much more reason-
ably “the Citizens of London” than is
the “ Colonial Party ” any shadow of Australia.
It is self-appointed and self-delegated. It holds
no pretence of warrant from Australia. It
would he just as unreasonable and not more im-
pudent for a clique of N.S.W. Parliamentarians
to squad themselves into “ the British Imperial
Party,” and attempt to advise or coerce the
British Commons according to the clique’s
ideas of the necessity for new self-advt. It
would be far less unreasonable, and not half so
impudent, for the writer to advertise himself as
“Baron of London,” and promulgate from the
Woolloomooloo Fislnnarket a “ Code of Rules
for the Guidance of the London County
Council.” London could be splendidly governed
from Woolloomooloo, provided that somebody
woiJ.d furnish the banquets and liquors without
which all good Government is impossible.
The collapse of the motion of censure in N.S. W.
Parliament last week was a foregone conclusion.
The cause of the trouble was the glaringly ex-
travagant payments in connection with the
Dean Commission, and probably three-fourths
of the House would gladly have voted that
these payments were utterly disgraceful. But,
though this was the question ostensibly before
the House, the question that hung on the vote
was whether it would have Reid or Lyne for
Premier. And the majority had to vote against
its conscience that the payments in question
were perfectly right, as the only way of voting
that it didn’t want Lyne as Premier—which is
just as logical as if it had to vote that Fer-
guson’s bull-dog was a retriever as the only
way of declaring that it didn’t think John See
was a success as Treasurer. Party Government
is built like that, somehow.
Any legislation on Employers’ Liability for
negligence is imperfect (writes a democratic
Victorian lawyer to The Bulletin) without the
extension of the time during which notices of
action, &c., may be given in order to enable an
injured person to sue. As a matter of right, no
such notices should be exacted at all. They
are not required in ordinary actions for negli-
gence, and it was a deliberate piece of class
legislation to insert them when this Act was
passed. Morally, the employer should be liable
for injuries caused to a workman through the
negligence of a fellow-workman in the same
way as he would for injuries similarly caused
to a member of the public. But a silly decision
of a bench which couldn’t conceive the
possibility of its being just that a butler
should have the right to recover for in-
juries arising from the negligence of the
cook, has settled the matter otherwise. Par-
liament has made timid reforms in a few
cases, but has spoiled even this patchwork by
the provisions as to notice. It often happens,
on account ot the care, anxiety, and confusion
inseparable from the accident which may
have deprived the bread-winner of his
limbs, to say nothing of the common ignor-
ance of the technical details of the law,
that a lawyer is not even instructed till
after the time for giving notice has expired.
The plausibility of the employer, studiously
careful not to commit any admission to writing,
often helps also to cause delay in inquiry. In
fact, the technicalities of the present Victorian
law on this subject are so many that a cunning
employer caii, and often does, trap his maimed
workmen by palaver or apparent charity into a
false position. The whole subject needs
thorough revision, and will never be on a satis-
factory footing until it is provided in one simple
clause, without notices, limit of damages, or
anything else, that workmen shall have the
same rights against the negligent employer as
members of the public. At present workmen
are treated as if they were a serf class. Again
Vic. Labor members are warned, if that’s any
use, that a sudden dissolution of the present
Parliament would leave them without even the
present Act.
Sydney Telegraph of June 8 :
To instance the United States as an example of what a
thorough and general application of the Protectionist
principle to national production can do is to err through
design or through want of knowledge. The whole foreign
trade of the Republic, including specie, amounts, accord-
ing to most recent figures, to £207,000,000 per annum.
The internal trade, as represented by incomes, is
£2,500,000,000. It will thus be seen that the trade done
in the home market represents more than 91
per cent, of the whole. Of the remainder, only a
small part, less than half, according to one authority,
is subject to any influence from the protective duties.
The United States can fairly be regarded as one of the
greatest freetrade countries the world has ever seen.
From north to south, from coast to coast, there is not a
bar to the free exchange of products between States
whose characteristics and natural adaptabilities differ
widely. Great Britain has no such free market to
buy and sell in as the seventy millions of the people
who constitute the population of the United States.
It would be extraordinary indeed if with such varied and
magnificent natural resources, and with such freedom,
the people there could not stand for a long time ag-ainsb
the evil effects of artificial scarcity and dearness produced
by a monopolistic tariff, which can only influence about
five per cent, of its trade.
Query : Why has the Teleguaph Been wailing
off and on for years past about the evils of
Protection in U.S. since, after all, the U.S. is
“one of the greatest Freetrade countries the
world has ever seen ” ?
Melb. Argus touches the bedrock of crawlsome
and wicked imbecility in raising a subscription
for hard-up Chow market-gardeners, the unfor-
tunate washerwomen forced out of employment
by the compatriots of these cabbage-uoercers
being meanwhile left to the kindly operation
of the Vagrancy Act, or, if they happen to be
young, to the pleasing occupation of prostitu-
tion. Nobody ever sees a starving Chow, for
the simple reason that every sane and “ deserv-
ing ” Celestial is seen through his period of
tribulation by his clan or secret society, to which
he subscribes during good times. The clan is
no benevolent asylum ; it is conducted on hard
and fast lines, standing no nonsense, and firing
out skulkers and malingerers with much velie-
mence; still, apart from the insane, no Chow
willing and able to work is ever without a meal
or bed. This worship of colored races is essen-
tially an English weakness, and the Argus is
English, not Australian. Nigger-butclier Stan-
ley’s black-boy, brought from Uganda, com-
plained bitterly on his arrival in Amer ica. “In
England,” he pleaded, “ I was kissed by duch-
esses all day ; here they say, ‘ Git out, you gaw-
dam little nigger. ’ ”
Melville, the alleged radical of Vic. fat-man
House, deals out statistics in the Address in
Reply debate: —
Since he entered the Council it had passed 719 hills, and
had absolutely rejected only 25 ! If they had passed
those 25 as well, the country would have good reason for
saying that there was no need for an Upper House at
all. (“ Hear, hear,” and laughter.)
Accepting Melville’s figures, the inference is
right enough. If a non-representative Council
obstructs a representative Assembly, it should
be abolished. If it merely acquiesces to every-
thing, it should be abolished. Also, if it emas-
culates every Assembly measure, and farcically
“ passes” a maimed Bill —it should be abolished.
It isn’t necessary, by the way, to “ absolutely
reject” a bill, and that is very seldom done;
the measure is simply shelved, or dropped, or
postponed, or ordered to be read that day
six months. The Council has no need to
“ absolutely reject ” bills. Moreover, the Vic.
Legislative Council is an adept at emascula-
tion. The Factories Bill wrecked last session
was technically “passed” by the Council, and
rejected by the Assembly. But the “ permit
clause ” for out-workers was so tinkered by the
Council as to be ridiculous, and the punishment
ot offending employers was reduced to a mini-
mum. Nevertheless, the Bill was “ passed
and defeated. The Council will get the Bill
again, and will probably make some slight
“ concession ” with the haughty air of the
superior person —which the Assembly will ac-
cept if its present mood continue.
Thirty constituents of James Balfour have
held a meeting to encourage the re-election of
that undesirable saint to Vic. Leg. Council.
The Bulletin would like to feel sure that
those 30 earnest Balfourians are related by
blood or marriage to the 49 abandoned crea-
tures who voted for Tom Bent down at South
Melbourne the other week. The possibility of
Bent and Balfour, and such like public per-
sons, having free and independent supporters
scattered all over the surface of Victoria is very
disquieting. Balfour’s past record and his
terriblereverence for the Sabbath are sufficiently
strong reasons why no constituency should
send him to Parliament to assist in blocking
the Companies Act Amendment Bill any fur-
ther. But an even stronger reason for abolish-
ing the sour-faced saint lies in James Service’s
“ unqualified praise of Mr. Balfour’s piiblic
acts and private character.” Service presided
at tlie meeting aforesaid, and had the magnifi-
cent assurance to state that if, by any mis-
chance, Balfour happens to gets left out of the
Vic. Leg. Council at the ensuing batch of elec-
tions, the country will suffer a heavy loss. The
country which would feel the loss of Balfour
must lie in a bad way.
Premier Turner engineered the opening scenes
of the new Vic. session of Parliament in
characteristic fashion. Governor’s address,
address in reply, the mover’s speech—were all
as mild as milk. Turner goes warily, like a
wily solicitor. Last session ended with
sulphurous threats at the Council. Turner
doesn’t know anything about that. He doesn’t
know that this session must go far to settle the
position of the Council. It he were the
teacher of a ladies’ college he could not
know less. The Opposition looked for an
opening, but could find nothing. The Labor
Corner, aching for a fight, and listening for
trumpet-blasts, rub their eyes in amazement at
Turner’s harmlessness. All the recess there
havebeen mass-meetings denouncing the Council,
the Labor members have breathed blood and
slaughter, members of the Opposition have
denounced the denouncers of the Council.
Turner blinks amiably through his spectacles
and knows nothing about any row. The As-
sembly has its work to do. Turner never
heard of the Council. But if the Council
assaults inoffensive citizens’ bills .
The identification of James Butler, the Maori-
land recediviste, by two Melbourne citizens who
allege robbery-under-arms, was a disgraceful
farce. Instead of being placed among 10 or 20
others, Butler was simply taken from his cell
and confronted with each “ victim ” in succes-
sion. Even then neither of the men was able
to say more than that he was the same sort of
a ruffian, and, “ to the best of their belief,” lie
was the man. The value of this identification
may be gauged by reference to the stories re-
lated by the injured parties at the dates of the
crimes. The first then told the police that he
did not get a good view of his assailant’s face,
but he would “know his voice anywhere”;
yet at the “ identification ” Butler’s voice was
left severely alone. The second stated that his
footpad wore a false beard, and that it was
quite dark at- the time, also that the interview
lasted only a few seconds. And yet the much-
qualified recognitions of these men are trum-
peted forth to the world as “ identifications ! ”
Employers’ liability reform is on the board
in S.A., according to the Governor’s speech. Par-
liament should take care that any sections dealing
with the rights of seamen under this Act are
within the powers of the legislature. The present
sections of the S.A. Act on this subject are, almost
certainly, ultra vires as to the majority of the ships
trading with Adelaide, and this may vitiate the
sections when they come to be applied to the rest.
From a survey of all the Australasian Acts, one is
forced to the conclusion that nothing but the legis-
lation of a federated Australasia, or the provisions
of an Imperial Enabling Act, will do much to
protect sailors outside the three miles limit. And
even within this limit the provisions would have
to be very carefully worded to affect foreign or
English ships, if they could affect them at all.
Perhaps the best present practical course would be
for the Australian Premiers to confer and arrange
for a united “crawl ” to the Colonial Office and the
Admiralty on the subject.

The new American co. opened on Saturday
at Sydney Lyceum to a crowded audience, which,
from the noise it made, seemed immensely pleased
all through—though why it should have been
quite so pleased the present scribe knows not.
lor the “Trip to Chinatown” is reminis-
cent of the lamented “Morocco Bound,” which
froze some time ago, inasmuch as it consists of a
collection of songs and a number of variety turns
suspended on a thin streak of alleged plot, like the
family armor hung out to dry on a thread. A
considerable quantity of people walk around con-
siderably and say they are going somewhere as an
excuse for saying they will sing one more song
before they go there, and after they have sung the
song they don’t go—they stay to sing some more
songs. When at last they do go they stop on the
way to have supper, and don’t have supper—they
sln K j us t one more little song before the supper
a l on £> kept on doing it indefinitely.
When they aren’t singing because they are
just going somewhere they are singing
because they have just arrived from some-
where. Finally, the last act shows them after
they have been at the place they have so long
been going to, and then they do another song
or two before they come away from it. The
result is long and shadowy and hazy and unsatisfac-
tory. Many of the turns are good enough to make
an exceedingly smart variety entertainment, and
many of the sayings are clever enough for an Oscar
Wilde comedy, but the attempt to string them
together into one narrative (which only consists in
eight people intending to go to a ball) by tying a
thm streak of conversation from the tail of the
last joke to the head of the next one is not wholly
successful. In the second act the stage is often left
entirely deserted save for an old man sitting on a
hot brick in one corner, and this act drags more
than usual, and gets lost in the mist even more
frequently than the others.
* * * *
The co. is good in places and respectably
second-rate in other places. Harry Conor vaguely
suggests himself as a most capable comedian who
might appear to better purpose in a show which
wasn t quite so much like a spectre straying in a
fog, and he has the additional advantage of being
the only man in the co. who talks exactly like
Mark Twain. The rest talk like somebody else—
possibly the late Josh Billings. Frank Lawton,
as the waiter, is a comedian whom The Bulletin
swears by without any reservation whatever.
Moreover, he is a heavenly whistler, with more
music in his whistle than all the rest of the show
has in its soul. Miss Bessie Clayton’s skirt-dance
is a marvel of contortion, and whether Bessie
travels as a dancer or as a contortionist, she
is equaHy good either way. Also, Miss Geraldine
•j ann 13 a P rett y an d exceedingly nice
widow. The other three ladies at the tail-end of
the bill have no special points about them, and
with the exception of George Beane—the man
who sits wearily in a corner for sixty minutes—
there is a lot of dust and ashes about the rest of
the gathering. The big tenor is only noteworthy
because he is the walking duplicate of the big
baritone—they got measured for each other, appa-
rently, and this similarity is the result; and
Patrice is an unconvincing little woman in boy’s
clothes. Some of the songs are'good and some are
moderate, and the people come back and sing it all
over again on too little provocation. Probably, a
great want of tangibleness is what is really the
matter with the “Trip to Chinatown.”
** * *
On Saturday night George Darrell arose
once more at Her Majesty’s and raged afresh in a
new, bounceable, india-rubber drama of terrible
intensity called the “Crimson Thread.” Said
drama is G.D.’s own latest literary effort, and
it represents the author, as a British detective in
Chicago, and Inman as a ’Murkan tough of bowel-
less ferocity, prowling after each other’s scalps
through four acts. Darrell is in search of a friend
who vanished 25 years ago, or his heirs, executors,
or assigns, or the blood of the man who killed him
—he doesn’t mind which. Consequently he and
Inman disguise themselves in vast masses of long
hair apiece and go round stealthily in search of
each other. Each one swears to have the other’s
ber-lud the first time they meet, therefore they
come together in Act I. and Darrell escapes
through the window, and in Act 11. they meet and
pull each other’s hair somewhat, and in Act 111.
they foregather again and throw each other over-
board very considerably, and in Act IV. they mutu-
ally prance in a vegetable garden, and in between
all these meetings they make dreadful resolves as
to what will happen if they keep on meeting. At
last it begins to appear that one of them will cer-
tainly catch rheumatism through exposure if they
meet many dozen times more without any active
shooting, but providentially a common Chicago
policeman plugs Inman as he is rushes over the
fence after omitting to kill Darrell for the fifth
time (it is understood that the blood-stained
desperado is still alleging as he rushes over the
fence that he will butcher his enemy at sight), and
he is carried back to where Darrell isn’t actively
running after him in the garden, though he is still
stating that there will be a dreadful reckoning for
Inman whenever they meet; and their mutual
animosity is thereafter buried in the bad man’s
grave.
The manner in which these two men of
iron resolve that something dreadful will happen
whenever they meet, and it never does happen
except through the wild, casual gunning of a police-
man, is affecting. The sensation of the “ Crimson
Thread ” is a realistic and business-like train
going over a very creditable bridge, and three
people falling from various heights into a capable
and brilliant tank. In addition to the two men
who don’t shoot each other as above-mentioned,
the play is ably propped up by Miss Gladys Leigh,
Miss Lilia Wiide—the latter as a stormy girl in
the newspaper and peanut business; and a number
of other people, most of whom are Harry Leston.
The co., in fact, is very good all round, and the
objection is mainly the drama, which is written
with a bucket of red paint and a spade. How
Inmftn gets up his reputation as a desperado of the
most awful description, seeing that he allows
Darrell to call him a liar with hardly a protest,
and how Darrell ever became a brilliant detective,
considering that his prey meets him and shakes
him and disarranges his pretty hair and goes away
uncaptured, are two mysteries that defy solution.
** * *
Woods and Marshall, the lessees of
Her Majesty’s, leave Sydney for a time at
least, and a complimentary benefit to Alfred
Woods is being organised as a send-off.
The Bulletin trusts he will get a good
one, if only because his nigger in “ Bobbery
Under Arms ” is the best aboriginal this paper re-
members on the Australian stage. The firm at
Her Majesty’s consists of one very young man and
one very young girl (for the pretty Mrs. Marshall
is no more than that), and it tackled the biggest
theatre in Sydney with small resources and
unlimited pluck. It had a spell of remarkable and
well-deserved success, and then, by mischance, it
got mixed up in ruinous law proceedings, and the
great, damp hand of costs fell upon it, and the
curse which is always waiting about this theatre
came home to roost. The Bulletin trusts that
the benefit will pan-out for enough to enable Alf.
Woods—wherever he and the co. are' going—to
take the biggest theatre in that place—whatever
place it may he—and prosper for ever afterwards.
** * *
The last nights of “ Derby Winner ” are
announced at Sydney Royal. Despite the many
weeks during which Baker has repurchased his
horse for ,£25,000 every night, the present drama
is still going well, and apparently, if Bland Holt
cared to stretch his luck as far as it would go
without breaking, he might have put up a record
run. And this isn’t a good time for records, either.
* * *
At time of writing, Sydney Tivoli an-
nounces the last four nights of Harry Rickards,
and the last three nights of Tennyson and
O’Gorman, and the last night of ventriloquist
Winton, so, presumably, a vast mass of new
talent will he turned on next Saturday. A big
benefit is announced for the widow and children
of the unfortunate person who was fatally dropped
upon in the Tivoli stalls some time ago, but as
said benefit will be over before this appears in
print The Bulletin can only wish it luck in a
retrospective sort; of way.
* * *
The luckless Sydney Music Hall is open
again with the American Prolique Minstrel and
Burlesque Co. on the stage, and the ghost of the
various defunct managements on the front door-
step. Things are not quite so bad with the present
co. as with some that went before ; still, it seems
as if the star of the Music Hall had set. In fact,
it never rose. In fact, it is questionable if the un-
happy place ever had any star at all.
** * *
Mrs. Potter’s re-appearance in “Camille,”
at Melb. Princess’s, was bound to suffer from the
fact that Sarah Bernhardt had been there between
the ’Murkan lady’s visits. After seeing Bern-
hardt identify herself with the character of the
amorous consumptive, one finds it harder than
ever to believe in Mrs. Potter’s imitation ; and to
see “Camille,” without a strong faith in the
heroine, is to be wearied by a wire-drawn piece of
sickly sentimentalism. Dumas’ story has nothing
but naughtiness to recommend it. The two male
competitors for Camille’s favors are equally unin-
teresting, and the more manly and respectable of
the pair is the Count who pays the piper whilst
the other fellow calls the tune. Camille at her best
is only a harlot who commits herself to an act of
unwomanly self-sacrifice on the altar of a tin god.
She attempts to cure her lover’s passion by
actually “ taking up ” with the Count de Yarville
whereas she might have answered the same pur-
pose by pretending to run away with an imaginary
protector. In which case, however, the plav
would be robbed of its chief vice.
* * * *
Mils. Potter as Camille gives an oppor-
tunity for comparisons between her histrionic
powers of these and former days. She is much
less affected in the lighter scenes than she used to
be, her consumptive cough has greatly improved
and her sobs are now almost heartrending. On the
other hand, Mrs. Potter’s efforts at tragic acting
have ; weakened somewhat, and her death scene
didn t deserve the applause heaped upon it on
Saturday by a section of the audience. Indeed
the fury of first-night demonstrations at the
Princess sis becoming farcical. Bellew’s perform-
ance of Armand Duval seems much the same
stagey, showy, skilfully exaggerated article as
before; Scot.lnglis is a natural and unassuming
Count, the style of J. P. Cathcart is utterly un-
suited to Duval, pire, and Hans Phillips pops up
pleasantly among the minor people, none of whom
are as important as Mrs. Potter’s costumes. On
Saturday they change to “La Tosca.”
** * *
Belle w s Marat is essentially a creature of
the stage, and only to be criticised as such. The
real Marat was an accomplished physician, suffer-
ing from a horrible disease contracted through
circumstances which, in a measure, excused his
remorseless savagery. This is not suggested by
Bellew. His Marat seems to be a man-monkey,
a naturally dirty, sordid informer, who limps
through the revolutionary period crying “ Arrest
that man ! ” in the spirit of a beggar-on-horsebaclt.
Surely the foreigner who assumed the position
of the People’s Friend, despite his repulsive ap-
pearance, must have been a man of commanding
intellect and will power, not merely a cunning,
craven monkey.
** * *
The “Trilby ” burlesque, at Melb. Royal,
turns out to be humorous in spots, and not par-
ticularly sad elsewhere. Also, it possesses brevity,
which is the soul of wit. The entertainment on
Saturday worked itself out by ten o’clock, and as
the vast audience didn’t stop to clamor for more,
it went away satisfied, The Bulletin supposes.
All the same, this journal would tremble for the
financial prospects of a travesty that terminated at
10 p.m., even if the management had staged it
regardless of expense. Maggie Moore’s ver-
sion of “ Trilby ’ ’ is not a costly experi-
ment, neither is the company strong in
the particular sort of talent and experience required
for doing much with little material. The first
Gaiety Co. might have elaborated the poor little
Royal “skit” into a full-sized joke, with Fred
Leslie, Marion Hood, and Nellie Farren as Sven-
gali, Trilby, and Little Billee —but no matter.
Some of the points in Du Maurier’s play admit
of very easy parody, and, in some cases,
these are made the most of by Maggie Moore,
Roberts, and Walter Rivers. The leading
lady’s pride in her bare tootsies is
frank and fearless. Svengali and Gecko
making music upon dummy instruments are neces-
sarily funny ; likewise the idea of destroying the
mesmerist’s ungodly influence with bad liquor.
There are hearty laughs, here and there, in the
course of the show. If the laughs were more fre-
quent, and if many other matters were different to
what they are, “Trilby ” might run for a month
at Melb. Royal.
** * *
The Frantz Family retains its hold at the
Opera House, and t.he prosperity of that popular
establishment is still bloated. Jewish amateur
opera at the Bijou has come to a rather well-
deserved conclusion, therefore the chief offenders
may be left to repent in silence. Chevalier de
Kontski, the G.O.M. of the pianoforte, is giving
recitals at the Bijou this week, assisted by Madame
Wiedermann and old friend Buzzi. At Melb.
Town Hall the first of an uncertain number of
popular concerts was to happen on Monday last.
At Poverty Point .
The Distressed Actors’ Fund, although drawn upon by
mummers from all parts of Australia, seems to be a
Purely Vic. institution. One experience of a Theatrical
Carnival in Sydney didn’t encourage the Firm to identify
itself with further attempts in the same direction. Some
nasty remarks by a Melb. weekly, re last year’s voting of
douceurs to certain busy workers for the Fund, were not
called for. No other charity in the country is so econo-
mically managed, taking one year with another, as the
D.A.F.
Wallace Brownlow has gone to Westralia, at the instiga-
tion of W. R. Wilson, who— The Bulletin regrets to hear
is in bad health again. Nor that Brownlow’s journey
West has anything to do with the health of W.R.W.
A delay of 20 minutes in raising the curtain, and subse-
quent wearisome intervals between acts on the first night
of “ Camille,” at Melb. Princess’s, made it appear that La
Belle Potter was playing Sarah Bernhardt as well as per-
forming Sarah’s favorite character. Possibly the first
long wait was a concession to Mrs. P.’s proUgee, Miss Ida
Hamilton, who had to appear in the opening scene as
Camille’s maid, and was so unready with her lines that
she needed prompting when the time came for telling De
Varville the story of the old Duke’s fatherly affection for
the courtesan. The embarrassed damsel got stuck at the
word “duke” until De Varville coughed for assistance
from the man with the book.
The first (and wettest) night of “ Charlotte Corday,” at
Melb. Princess’s, found all parts of the house crowded,
with the exception of the amphitheatre. On the five fol-
lowing nights the order of things was reversed. Sassiety
seems to have lost interest in Mrs. Potter, and the mis-
take of starting their season with “As You Like It” is
now admitted. It was really George Musgrove’s mistake,
for the campaign was planned under his advice. G.M.,
remembering Bellew’s former success as a professional
beauty, reckoned tbit his Orlando would be an equal
attraction with the m w Rosalind. But the Melbourne
girls don’t seem to bib ll,is time.
At a performance o i “Dick Whittington,” by Burton’s
Rockhampton Liliputi n Opera Co., a pleasant incident
happened. The cat, in making a spring upon an imagin-
ary mouse, left his tail under the toe of a chorus-girl.
She, in no way abasia I, picked up the caudal appendage
and pinned it where it would be most useful.
The church and the concert platform are getting to be
on familiar terms, anyhow. Edward Branscombe, the
new tenor imported by Stevens and Howells, is a lay vicar
of Westminster Abbey, whatever that may mean in point
of holiness. Douglas Powell, the baritone member of the
same co., graduated in a church choir.
F. : Musical criticisms in the Melb. morning dailies
often have some snap in them—unlike the dramatic
crude-icisms, which are mostly written in the advertising
manager’s office. The musical criticisms are written by
professionals—and the harmony that always doesn’t exist
among musicians is responsible for the most snappy
remarks. A musician will always tell the truth about a
rival, unless it is flattering. Pianists who propose to
settle in Melbourne (though all Melb. musicians don’t
settle) always have a bad time. Transient contraltos, on
the other hand, are permitted to get their notices cut
according to advt. The way to get readable dramatic
criticisms, instead of pump-water, would be to employ
pros, who are resting. If we must have lies, let us have
readable lies.
Pro. : Isn’t there room in Australia just now for a re-
vival of old-time comedy—“ The Rivals,” “School for
Scandal,” “ She Stoops to Conquer,” “ Money,” &c. ? Such
a representation would be a welcome relief from modern
melodrama and “ neurotism.” Costume pieces formed the
staple of Chas. Wyndham’s recent benefit in London, at
which £2300 was realised—the result of two performances,
afternoon and evening. (Chas. W., by the way, gifted the
whole of the proceeds to the poorer members of the pro-
fession —a great act by a great actor !).
S.S.: “It is not the Frantz family that draws the
females to the miscellaneous show at Melb. Opera House :
it is Frank Yorke. Yorke comes on in an insane arrange-
ment of primitive kilts and a tar-brush. The kilts are a
mere wisp and the rest is legs, horrible legs in fleshings
with carbuncles on them as big as gourds, and warped
like stale bolognas, but a man’s legs, nevertheless • and
when Yorke is jerking those gnarled extremities in a
lunatic dance how the women laugh—how they toss up
their hands and rock on their seats, reckless of hair and
stay-busks, and shriek ! To the average man, Yorke’s
turn seems coarse and humorless, a mere suggestion of
hideous nudity and wind-galls ; to the woman, it is evi-
dently the most unctuous comedy. In 10 years I have
never seen the women of an audience so tickled, and it
fetches them all at once. A man never sees humor in a
woman’s legs—they are either exquisite or pathetic.”
C.M.G. : “One begins to see how little separates true
froln tra B' ed .V, watching a herd of amateurs in one
of Gilbert’s operas. ‘ Pinafore ’it is usually. Amateurs
have been giving a few unwary strangers their ideas of
the briny opera at Melb. Bijou. Thev dress well thev
sing passably, and would look well if they were not so
timid with the grease-paint, hut their humor—oh ! the
pathos of it, the lingering, tearless sorrow ! And yet how
funny these people could be in ‘ Hamlet ’! Amateurs
should invariably play tragedy; to be amused is the
desire of every playgoer in our time, O Lord.”
t “Chinatown’ B ” Patrice is not very original, after all
In Tricotnn,” one of Ouida’s earlier books, the gods
used to howl for their footlight favorite, Coriolis. Fergus
Hume also hasa burlesque artiste. Caprice, in Miss Mephis-
lopheles. r
“ When we saw this city my heart was just too full for
utterance,” was the butter-and-honey which the Yankee
burlesquess, Sadie M‘Donald, gave to a Sydney press-
interviewer, right off the reel. The average Yankee girl
is a melting jujube, when she likes.
Sydney D.T.’s theatrical interviewer, among the “Hoyt
and M‘Kee ” Yankee girls, seems to have been like a tame
wallaby among a lot of beautifully-spotted she-panthers—
“ attractive and vivacious,” all but one, whom he found
to be “ a languorous girl of 19.” Wickedness and senti-
ment.
Chief Justice Madden’s illogical judgment in the
Richardson v. Richardson divorce-case, where he refused
to cut the knot on the ground that the husband had not
sufficiently guarded the wife from temptation, has been
rendered more ridiculous than ever by his Honor’s dis-
covery of collusion on the lady’s part. This is an addi-
tional reason, says Madden, C.J., why a divorce should be
withheld. As a matter of fact, it was the only legal
reason for his judgment, but he knew nothing about it at
the time.
Mrs. 8.-Pot. threatens to play Lady Macbeth to K.
B’s Macbeth. Can anyone imagine Cora as the terrible
centrepiece in the Scotch tragedy? When Ellen Terry
played the part, someone said : “It is not Ellen Terry as
Lady Macbeth, but Lady Macbeth as Ellen Terry.”
Alice Rebottaro has made a welcome reappearance, in
Melb., with the Jewish amateurs. She came with Mine.
Simonsen’s Italian Opera troupe, and made a good im-
pression in “Lucia.” However, her father has the same
hatred of the stage which possesses Stefani, the husband
of Madame Boema, and she has been quietly teaching.
Mrs. Brown Potter, who has realised that Worth does
not make the actress, probably tries harder than any
other woman prominent on the stage to be an artiste, but
play-goers can say with the Vicar of Bray : “ You do, you
do ; we have observed your efforts,” and that is the devil
of it. Mrs. B. P. struggling with a bit requiring intensity
of feeling reminds one of the strong man putting up great
weights, and suggests the advisability of a severe course
of training with light diet. Instead of being carried away
by the genius of the actress, one. sits considering at her
physical powers and comparing her with the little doll of
a woman who carries the Frantz family on her snowy
shoulders, much to the advantage of the acrobat. Gush-
ing young critics of the “ nocent waterspout” order
declare that Potter equals Bernhardt, but is the victim of
blind prejudices. Can it be that the average man,
absorbed in the physical attractions of the tawny Cora,
has no eyes for her spiritual beauties ?
“ He is the archetype of the anarchists who would wreck
the whole fabric of society.” Thus does Dr. Armont
Corday play to the circle, referring to Marat in the Melb.
Princess show. How can any man refer to a contem-
porary as an archetype of something to come ? “I.
Montesquieu,” the author of “ Charlotte Corday,” gravely
suspected of being Potter and Bellew in disguise, should
certainly try and make his characters remember the
century they live in. The time has not yet arrived for
Charlotte to go to execution on a bicycle.
One of the first actions of the French Republic was to
pass an act repealing God, and giving the clergy 24 hours
to clear out of France. Yet in Charlotte Corday at Melb.
Princess, an abbe is depicted mingling freely with the
public at a period three years later. Historical inac-
curacies like this must rankle in the bosom of Cora
Urquhart 8.P., whose worship of truth led her to envelop
her calves in hideous bandages in “ As You Like It.”
The death of Augustus Harris will probably upset a
number of operatic (Italian and English) arrangements for
the present London season. Harris’s theatrical business
was so large and risky, and so much under his personal
management, that it can hardly pass into other hands
without being slowed down for awhile.
Augustus Harris got his managerial inspiration from
his father, who used to run promenade concerts at Covent
Garden, but Harris p&re hadn’t half the shrewdness,
energy, and all-round cleverness of his boy, Gus. The late
“ Knight of Drury,” as some of the London weeklies
called him, took over Drury Lane Theatre from a bank-
rupt lessee (Chatterton), and made money right from the
start of his career. He collaborated with the late Henry
Pettittand Paul Merritt in writing “The World,” “Youth,”
and numerous other gaudy dramas, and, until he grew
fat, he played the hero in a brisk, unconventional manner,
thereby saving himself a “star’s” salary. He always
drew up the scheme of his gorgeous Xmas pantomime,
and never failed to beat his own previous record in that
direction. No doubt Augustus Harris had sound business
reasons for pushing himself into the London Corporation
and City Council, although most men in his position would
have kept clear of aldermen and Lord Mayor’s shows.
Judging from his appearance of late years, the busy man
fell a victim to civic banquets.
A London paper says of Letty Lind that she “ acts with
the daintiness by which she has gradually come to be
recognised as an artist.” Seven years ago The Bulletin
called Letty Lind an artist in contradistinction to the
other Gaiety dancer, Sylvia Grey, whose acting was
abominably careless.
Bellew’s diffieulty has always been not to imitate Irving,
and now, with his Chas. Clarkly silver hair, he is quite the
younger brother.
The Wednesday matinee is now announced as a regular
thing, at Melb. Princess’s, Saturday being proved not to
answer.
Friend : “ Painful to see Geo. Ireland’s schedule, in the
Melb. papers this. week. When Rhadamanthus Molesworth
has been passed, he must get a Ben. His first appearance
on the regular stage, after brilliance as an amateur, was in
Melb., 1858, as Sir Eglamour, in the “Two Gentlemen of
Verona,” with Brooke. He advises amateurs.”
The first Australian Camille was Mary Provost (38 years
ago), and they used to work up a lot of excitement by say-
ing she was rapidly dying of consumption. Thirty-eight
years ago ! Not long back, we met with an assertion that
she was acting old women in America. The venerable

S.G. : “ Apropos the Potter-Bellew ‘ As You Like It,’
why do all mummers insist on talking Shakespeare’s lines
at about the pace of a spavined hearse-hauler ? I have
never heard a really decent Jaques yet. Jaques has
been laughing cynically all over the forest, and says so
himself. Yet every exponent of the part delivers the big
speech as if he were intoning a burial-service. Rosalind
is plainly girlish, lively, enticing. Yet her lines are usually
spoken like family morning-prayer. That old Adam
should speak slowly is understandable in a man of his age.
The two bright, redeeming attempts to escape tongue-
fettered funereality are those of Billy Elton and Polly
Emery as might be expected in people who bear sug-
gestively lively names like Billy and Polly. A fellow with
a name like Orlando naturally must be thinking all the
time whether his hat is on straight and his tights have no
mud on them; so, perhaps, Bellew’s not so much to
blame as he seems. Why can’t a company remember that
Shakespeare was a jolly, devil-may-care house-author who
died from over-grogsomeness?”

The doings of the Ward Farmers’ Association—
the concern which has bankrupted and politically
wrecked the M.L. Treasurer—grow more remarkable as
the revelations go on. One astounding circumstance is
that when the grain-buying transactions of the Associa-
tion turned out well the profits went to the Association ,
when they went wrong, which they generally did, the
loss was debited to Ward. Why this was done Ward
doesn’t say ;he simply alleges that it was done. There-
fore, the Association kept paying away its profits in divi-
dends and debiting the losses to Ward until the amount
debited was more than Ward could pay. Then he
collapsed, and the Association, which had been reckoning
him as an asset for any amount, collapsed, too. It
is difficult to understand how either Ward or the Associ a
tion could expect anything else. it is also alleged that
the Association gave the Colonial Bank stdre warrants fni
£30,000 worth of oats, and induced the Bank, on tln<
strength of this, to credit it with a draft for £30,000 to
make its overdraft look good. There were really no civ ,
so that the warrants were bogus and the draft worth It n'i
The man who gave the bogus warrants wasn’t prosecuted
neither was he sacked. At the time the Colonial Bank
made out its last balance-sheet the draft, it is said, was
supposed to be good ; but it is also alleged that before the
balance-sheet was presented to the shareholders the
£30,000 security was found to be waste paper. vet,
apparently, the balance-sheet wasn’t altered, although
this transaction threw quite a new light on the bank s
finances. The bank, so far, seems to view the matter in a
perfectly unembarrassed spirit. Altogether the business
appears to have been managed by everybody concerned
on purely aboriginal principles, and no one seems really
to know the reason of anything.

The A. J.S. Bank issues a circular to its British
depositors, offering to convert £1,000,000 of the 4i per
cent, reconstructed deposits falling due between now and
1901 on the following terms £500,000 to be immediately
repaid in cash, and £500,000 to be converted into 3 per
cent, deposits not falling due until 1906. It is expressly
stipulated, however, that the A.J.S. doesn’t repay more
than £500,000 in cash ; therefore the above half-and-half
arrangement only applies if the rush of depositors doesn t
represent more than £1,000,000. If it represents
£2,000,000, then they are to receive one-quarter cash, one-
quarter 3 per cent, deposit-receipts, and one-half in 41 per
cent, deposit-receipts, as at present. According to latest
advices, however, the conversion will reach about
£900,000. This means about £20,250 interest saved
annually by payment of one-half, and £6750 saved
by reduction of interest on the other half total,
£27,000 a year. The A.J.S. has made comparatively
little progress at reducing its reconstructed depo-
sits ; at the end of 1893 they stood at £7,692,894, and
at the end of 1895 they had only been reduced by about
£1,000,000. Considering that over £6,000,000 of them fall
due by regular half-yearly instalments in 1897-1901, the
present offer to pay off £500,000 (less than one half-year’s
instalment), on condition that another £500,000 is dated
10 years ahead at a big reduction of interest, looks like a
very feeble way of tackling the difficulty.
**• * *
It is reported that the Westralian Govt, has a
scheme on hand for a £5,000,000 loan. Half the money is
wanted for water-supply purposes ; £1,500,000 for railway
building ; and £1,000,000 for the purchase of the “private
enterprise ” Great Southern Line, it having been decided
that syndicate management is a failure. The Great
Southern is 243 miles long, so at the price mentioned it
will cost the State about £4115 per mile—only about £3OO
per mile more than the average cost of construction by
the State —and the land-grant of 12,000 acres per mile,
and the amounts which have been paid for interest on the
co.’s debentures to keep the line out of the insolvency
court. So, reckoning all things, the Government won't
Eay more than 1J times as much as it would have cost to
uild the line as a public enterprise at the beginning. A
£5,000,000 loan represents something like £4O a head
added to the debt at one fell swoop—in proportion to
population almost as much, in one dreadful act, as the
whole public debt which Victoria has accumulated in forty
years. If this event comes off, Westralia will have, in
proportion to population, the biggest debt in Australasia,
and the biggest boom, with the biggest burst looming in
the distance.
* * * *
Considering Westralia’s experience with its two
land-grant railways, both of which, after they had been
subsidised at the rate of 12,000 acres per mile of line, had
to be propped up by State guarantees for enormous
amounts ; and Maoriland’s experience with its land-grant
line, which burst because the State wouldn’t prop it up in
the same way—where would Queensland be now if the
great gridiron railway-scheme had been carried out ?
Judging by these other experiences, after most of the public
lands had gone in subsidies Queensland would have had
to guarantee about £20,000,000 worth of debentures, or
else have about twenty half-finished scraps of railroad left
on its hands to be finished and worked by the State, while
about twenty British shindykits would sue the Govern-
ment for £1,000,000 damages apiece. The land-grant
railway job almost always comes to the same disastrous
ending.

The awful Freehold Investment and Banking
Co. (Melb.) has passed away. Its assets were so unrealisable
that it simply handed over the whole lot—nominally worth
£1,330,000—t0 the creditors. The creditors now call
themselves the Freehold Assets Realisation Co. They
have issued shares to themselves for the amount of their
claims, and the new co. collects the rents, when there
are any, and watches the alleged securities, and hopes to
pay a div. —some day.

The London Bank of Australia gives notion
that it will pay a third instalment of its reconstructed de-
posits (the one falling due July, 1900) on Ist January, I n
The London agreed to pay in ten annual instalmen ts <-
tending from 1898 to 1907. It has already wiped off nvo,
and when the present operation is completed only /en
will remain unpaid.

The National Bank of Tasmania shows a profit
for the half-year ended 31st May of £4299, againsi £1136
last half-year and £3989 and £4695 for two previous ones.
Therefore, though things are improving, they are still dis-
tinctly worse than they were in Nov., 1894. A 5 per cent,
div. and income tax thereon absorb £3991, leaving £3OB
to add to the funds. Business has improved a little in the
half-year. The reserve-fund (which hasn’t increased in
the last two years) still stands at £22,500 ; but the cash
reserve is large and solid, and equals 30 per cent, of the
liabilities to the public. The National has now been in
existence for 10 years, and it seems to have good pro-
spects if it keeps out of the mining boom now raging in
the serious little island. The last mining boom down
there, by the way, was what killed the V.D.L. Bank.
* * * *
The awful drop m the Vic. railway takings still
continues, and that regular weekly statement, “ the
revenue showed a decline of £2916 as compared with the
corresponding week of last year,” has become stereotyped.
Obviously, however, things must improve ; if the revenue
ultimately gets down to Id., then nothing on earth can
prevent it rising to 2d., and it will then have gone up 100
per cent, quite suddenly. The total, at latest, was
down to £33,430 per week.
* * * *
The National Bank of Maori!and, a concern
with its head office in London, reports a profit for the
year ended 31st March of £18,090, which is a distinct
improvement on the £16,431 of last year, and £16,998 of
the one previous. A 5 per cent, dividend uses up £12,500,
and the remaining £5590 goes to profit and loss, making
it £24,696. Under these circumstances, £20,000 is devoted
to starting a reserve, the last one having vanished when
the National Bank struck its big snag a few years ago.
Business has improved greatly with the National of late,
and it looks like having a run of prosperity.
* * * *
St. James’Building Society (Melbourne), a big
concern with £214,000 capital, announces that it has lost
£62,556 during the half-year. Last half-year the loss was
£7942, and the total deficiency in the assets is now
£72,285, which means one-third of the capital gone. The
St. James, like most other Melbourne societies, is loaded
up with a great dead-weight of foreclosed freehold pro-
perties, and as it sells them the difference between the
price realised and the book-value is added to the bloated
shortage, which promises to eat up everything before the
process is finished. During the past six months some
£30,000 worth (book-values) of leasehold property have
been thrown overboard to lighten the ship. _ Lease-
hold property is hardly worth calling an asset in Mel-
bourne these days.
• * * *
The day of small things. The Haymarket Land,
Building and Investment Co. (Sydney) states that it has
stopped the deficits of the previous 12 months, and that
the net profit for last half-year is £4 Is. 6d. And the
Argus Building Society (Melbourne) proudly reports a
profit of £7 for the year—equal to about 9d. per cent, per
annum.
* * * *
The Universal Building Society (Melbourne) has
property to the nominal value of £137,000, and the net
rental for last half-year was £533 —something like sixteen
shillings per cent, per annum.
° * * * *
The Manly (Sydney) ferry difficulty gets more
complicated. 'The directors of the new co. (‘ on its
uppers ”) proposed amalgamation, with the old one, but
the shareholders repudiated the idea —mainly, it would
seem, because the Brown firm of ship-owners offered to
finance them. Now the Browns have withdrawn, appa-
rently tired of waiting, and the new co. is left with no
amalgamation—no Brown —nothing. Also it owes the
old co. £550, and various other sums to other people, and
it has no ready cash, and the hank won’t honor its cheques,
and all is chaos. Therefore, amalgamation is again being
attempted, but’the Port Jackson Co., now that its hated
rival has no Brown to fall back upon, will probably be
hard to deal with.

The Imperial Marine Insurance Co. of Japan—
in the language of the Chrysanthemum Land, Ihe
“Teikoku Kaisho Hoken Kabushiki Kaisha”—with a
capital of 3,000,000 yen (about £400,000) has started busi-
ness in Sydney. Burns, Philp & Co. are the local agents.
Considering that the Australian fire and marine insurance
business is mostly done by foreigners already, and the
local offices are fast being smothered by the stupendous
mass of foreign competition, this big Jap. office may as
well add itself to the list as not. When every other nation
is scrambling for a share of the business, a Jap. company
more or less hardly signifies.
* * * *
The little borough of Marrickville (Sydney)
floated a £30,000 loan the other day at 4 per cent, and got
£lOl net. This was to pay off an old £30,000 loan which
cost £5 18s. 4d. per cent.

The affairs of the Union Milling Co., Horsham,
Vic., provide interesting information for the farmers of
that province. It appears that the co. went bung through
inability to satisfy the claims of the Commercial Bank,
that institution having pretty well everything with the
co. under mortgage. Included in the assets seized were
several thousand bags of wheat, stored at the mill by
local farmers, and the latter are kicking vigorously at the
action of the hank in seizing property that was simply
held by the co. in trust. The bank, however, sticks to
the grain, and the only party to whom the farmers can
look for redress is the co., which hasn’t anything left to
grant redress with, and which, it seems, did a perfectly
legal thing, as the law now stands, in mortgaging that
which it didn’t own. A similar case occurred at Numur-
kah (Vic.) last year, and the question of erecting Govern-
ment storage sheds was seriously thought over by the
Turner Ministry, but nothing eventuated. Possibly
something will eventuate this time. .If the farmers
throughout the province were to combine in a sort of
vigilance society they might perhaps discover that a lot
of the so-called'mills in the country districts are simply
living upon the hypothecation of the grain entrusted to
their custody.

The liquidator of the Union Finance Co. in Melb.
has announced a final div. of Is., making 20s. in the £
paid to creditors. The Argus commercial editor thus
comments : “ This is a very satisfactory result as times
go”! What! Which times? When our forefathers
clothed themselves in woad and were financially holiest?
Or the recent dark ages when so many of the biggest of
the boomsters laid the foundations of fortunes for tlieir
posterity ? Or perhaps the Argus man means the 21st
century, when his paper will consist of 20 cols, and sell at
Is. a copy ? Twenty shillings in the £ good as times go !
Of course it isn’t! That liquidator should have paid 40s.
on the quid and given every creditor an annuity and a
K.C.M.G.’s patent.

A side-splitting illustration of The Bulletin’s
recent remarks on the absurdity of three-ha’penny muni-
cipalities, gingerbread town-halls, and tin aldermen is the
corporative cataclysm that has overtaken the lilliputian
municipality of Five Dock (Sydney). This gorgeous little
state couldn’t meet the account of a creditor who dunned
it for a few pounds ; a bailiff took possession of its palatial
Town Hall, and the office sticks were sold up and realised
£2O 10s., or 7s. more than the debt plus the cost of bailiff.
The buyer, being the father of an alderman, has let the
municipality the furniture at a rental of 3d. a week, so
that the worst of the crisis is over. Five Dock is munici-
pally a quarter of a century old ! though the present cor-
poration is only a splinter of the old one. The latter was
proclaimed in ’7l ;it was divided into two in ’B9. Under
the rotten condition of N.S.W. municipal law, any area
whatever may be separated from an existing municipality
and proclaimed a municipality “ on its own” upon the
petition of two-thirds of “ the electors ”in that area. So
that it would not be impossible to have a N.S.W. munici-
pality composed of three persons and a vacant block of
land.
* * * *
Since the Vic. telephone system has been under
State control, an aggregate loss of £70,000 has been made ;
yet the private enterprise which previously ran the con-
cern paid a steady five per cent. Which fact is trium-
phantly pointed to' by the Fat press as a horrible example
of the fallacy of State Socialism, and another proof that
the railways should be auctioned at once. But the Tele-
phone Co. reaped the advantages of the seven years of
plenty, while the period of the lean kine from ’B9 to the pre-
sent day fell to the lot of the State. How long would the
private concern have maintained its divs. ? The Tram Co.
with its 25 per cent, and 10 per cent, bonuses dropped
pretty quick on the collapse of the boom.
* * * *
In Adelaide, the other day, the Yuba S.M. Co.
was floated in an hour or two to acquire a marvellous pro-
perty “in the Broken Hill district.” The co. (£75,000
paper-capital) had been in existence some time before any
information about it could be got in Broken Hill. The
locality, it appears, is Mt. Rohe—the district upon which
Bendigo Lansell spent some thousands, and which has re-
turned less for the money spent in it than any other in
the Barrier region. The particular mine is supposed to
be one held and abandoned in the days when silver stood
50 per cent, higher than it does to-day.

Junction North makes a start at serious busi-
ness with the sale of 2000 tons of first-grade sulphides to
be delivered within three weeks from date of signing the
contract. There ought to be a Is. div. for August; one
would have been declared by this, but the timbering bill
has been heavy—the ore body is very troublesome. The
co. sends on its own account an experimental lot of 600
tons of ore to Europe.
* * * *
Block 14 adds to its Port Adelaide plant the
largest furnace yet erected in
B.H. North stops its mill—for alterations.
Ominous. The irregularity of the ore body in this mine
must always give trouble while a mechanical process like
jigging is relied upon.
* * * *
Shareholders in the South ought to make them-
selves quite satisfied that the mine has honestly been
unable to pay a div. up to date before they sell at any re-
duced figure. To say the least, things in connec-
tion with this co. and mine are inexplicable to the out-
sider. * * *

B.H. Consols has resumed work, the English co.
—a plucky one—having reconstructed.
Small parcels of ore rich in silver are sent from
the Old Billagoe mine, in far Western N.S.W., to Alder-
shot, Q., and to Wallarroo, S.A., for treatment at a cost
of from £6 to £8 a ton. It is a free-milling ore that
might be treated on the ground for less than £1 a ton ;
nor would the plant involve any considerable cost. As in
the case of Mt. Drysdale, which is near it, far more money
has been spent in the carriage of ore than would erect
efficient machinery.
* * * *
Mt. Gahan, Pambula. It now appears the
hoped-for sale to an English-co. Was fallen through, that
the payable milling-ore has cut out, and that, to prospect
for the Victory lode, calls must be made.

The very worst has befallen Cobar as a mining
camp. A few weeks ago it was doing well, and seemed to
have a good, solid time ahead. Now the great Sunday
mining tipster has started to boom it. Cobar really
deserves a better fate.

Big things are predicted from the alluvial wash
on the Macquarie River, N.S.W., when a co. starts under
the distinguished patronage of Warnford Lock, the Czar
of Lucknow.” Harry Newman having been appointed
manager of the extension mines at Lucknow, he will
probably be re-crowned king of that locality. Neither is
he too modest to enjoy the appellation.
* * * *
Sensational wire from Cobar, N.S. W.: —“ Fresh
shoes have been put on the Mount Pleasant stampers.
So far, the news lacks confirmation.

The English co. that recently bought some
leases at Galley Swamp (N.S.W.) have, it seems, changed
the name to Gallymont; probably to get away from the
idea that the mines were in the middle of a swamp, which
they are not. They have been swamped with £300,000
capital instead. * * *
The Sunday “ tipster” advises all and sundry to
buy Rainbow and Mountain Maids—a mine at Copeland—
and refers to the very favorable report from the new
mining manager. Is this it: “ Cannot find anything to
doubt the bona-fides of the report issued. Everything is
full of water.”
* * * *
Cobar is determined to have a mining-boom or
burst. It has been proved easier to float a Cobar mine in
Cobar than in Sydney. No other N.S.W. mining camp
can say that. Cobar has now an open mining exchange.

Pambula (N.S.W.): “The Great Victory has
cleaned up a nice cake, but the weight has not been dis-
closed.” Ten oz. is a nice cake, so is 10,000 oz. —now which
is it ? Great things have for many months past been ex-
pected from this show, which has been regarded as the
most permanent thing in a will-of-the-wisp field.
“Gold at the back door of Melbourne.” At
Black Flat, six miles from Oakleigh—among the market-
gardens— about 80yds. from Moylan’s hotel, a local
market-gardener named Holland and his two sons (all ex-
miners) are now sinking a shaft right on the footpath of
the Spring Vale road. They have already got several
specimens on the surface—one weighing 16dwt.—and are
hopeful of striking the reef. Meanwhile, all the neighbor-
ing property-owners, including Movlan aforesaid, have
applied for leases. Holland informed the writer that he
had found payable alluvial gold on the easterly flat 34
years ago. ,
At a recent Ballarat (Vic.) land-sale £75 an
acre was refused for II acres of lucerne land, £9O being
the reserve. The land was subsequently sold privately at
nearly the reserve price.

Melbourne tobacco-factories are offering prizes,
bicycles, &c., to the individual who collects the greatest
number of tags or labels of certain brands of tobacco.

tobacco instead-of buying it ready cut) and thus collar the

Catherine Beef, Bendigo, bobs up again with a

time ahead.

Londonderry, Bendigo, six months erratic

Kyneton (Vic.) went delirious the other day over
the alleged discovery of a “ mountain of gold and silver,
estimated to go 400 oz. to the ton.” The whole hamlet
formed itself into a syndicate right away, but the joy
speedily turned into wails. A Footscray assay gave ldwt.
20gr. gold and 18gr. silver per ton. At latest, a posse of
inhabitants was preparing a new hell for the prospector.
North Woah Hawp, Ballarat, on 7idwt. stone
last half-year, just met ex.’s, but the prospects for the
coming term are better. The Indicator lode in No. 5 level
is tossing out much better gold, and the stone is making
strong underfoot, so that the deeper levels should speak
more cheeringly. The North is one of the mines on which
the royalty-battener weighs heavily.

Yields from Chalk’s No. 1, Carisbrook (Vic.),
slumped last half 44650 z. lldwts., showing none too well
against the previous term’s 51980 z. 12dwt., especially as
the latter had the worst of the fathom-average by lldwts.
Ditto divs., £4500—£7500. Important developments in
the north end are expected to give the yields a “push”
in a couple of months.

S.A. Govt. Geologist Brown is cautious in his
report on the Westralian mines. The only mine he ven-
tures a definite opinion upon is the Great Boulder, thus :
“The formation altogether appears to be the decomposed
and oxidised portion of what will most likely be a solid
lode at a greater depth.” His remarks on the other mines
are non-committal.

One important question will probably have to
be settled before the case of the Alliance Syndicate and
the Liberty Consolidated Gold Mines, Ltd., of Coolgardie,
is finally disposed of by Vie. Supreme Court—viz., whether
a contract for pooling shares is legally enforceable.
Warnings are given by most authorities on company-law
against the practice, on account of the danger of “ over-
stepping the mark.” There appear to be varieties of
pooling, from the kind that “ rigs the market ” and is in-
dictable as a conspiracy to defraud, to a perfectly legiti-
mate variety. In this particular case the statement of
claim reveals a carefully-worded agreement to pool cer-
tain allotted shares.
Another interesting feature of this case is a
letter alluding to the existence in London of a special
newspaper press devoted to Westralian mining matters.
These papers, according to this letter, wrote according to
the amount of payment received—it was a perfectly-
organised blackmaii. “I have established communica-
tion with two of the best financial papers,” significantly
concludes this remarkable missive.

When John Howell, ex-B.H. Prop, manager,
went to England last year, he took for flotation the Bush-
man’s, a Murchison (W.A.) mine, discovered by Broken
Hill prospectors. Howell transferred the job to White,
M.L.C., of M.L., and a co. was formed. An expert was
sent out, and he reports that there has been gross mis-
representation. The English co. refuses to. go on,, and
the vending B.H. syndicate finds itself left without either
mine or promised cash.

The cheerful market - aspect of the General
Gordon (White Feather, W.A.) has led to the inevitable
results rather earlier than usual. The G.G. scrip is
scarcely dry, yet already the G.G. Extended has been
floated easily, and a North Extended promises to meet the
same fate. There seems to be local faith in the parent
mine.

Stated with some appearance of truth that over
2000 oz. gold has been dollied from the Welcome lease,

Coolgardie is going to find half-a-dozen Boulders
right in the town. Two were discovered last week, and
when it settles down to the business that number, should
be found every day in the year. The last is in Lindsay’s
mine, North Bayley-street. Of course it is a “ composite
lode,” and assays 9oz. This lode is only 30ft. wide, but
the other is 60ft. Unfortunately, Coolgardie can’t rid
itself from its great curse —“ too much white quartz.”
Immortal phrase.

Golconda G.M. Co.: —“The chairman regretted
that the operations of the co. had not been as successful
as was anticipated.” A few rich specimens in a streak of
decomposed iron were found in cleaning out a tank.
Some men secured it under offer, and also secured the
tank under lock and key, till the co. was floated. The
patch soon gave out, but the shareholders are told “ the
prospects are encouraging.”
* * * *
The last wired Coolgardie discovery is said to be
within a mile of the town—a few days before it was out
near Burbank’s, and even now the exact spot is unknown,
“ the owners being very reticent. It is supposed to be
the Great Boulder formation.” There can’t be much
doubt of this, the Boulder being but 30 miles away. The
lode assays 270 z. to the ton, and, as it is only 60ft. wide,
it is child’s-play for the owners to conceal it from the
many thousands of people around Coolgardie. As the
lode was found in sinking a shaft, measuring the width—

A co. with a capital of .£250,000 is erecting a

to bring ore from the Golden Pig mine, at Southern Cross,

their lagoon to Coolgardie, over 300 miles. This co. can
have little faith in the Coolgardie fresh-water schemes.

good surface shows of the camp.

The West Australian Brick Co. publishes its
prospectus in this issue. The affair doesn’t seem likely
to stagger under too big a capital, and the directors have
adopted the excellent plan of making the £1 shares fully
paid. The salient points about the prospectus are (1)
the co. reckons that 100,000 bricks a week can be sold at
an estimated minimum profit of 10s. a thousand—£so a
week, or £2500 per year net profit. (2) The co. passesses
13 acres of clay, which it is calculated will produce
130,000,000 bricks, and it will take 20 years to exhaust
the deposit. (3) The co. will be the first in Perth to use
machinery for brickmaking. (4) A new loan for public
buildings has been announced by Premier Forrest, and a
big demand is anticipated from public as well as private
sources.

One Mt. Lyell furnace is now in blast, and
“there is every promise that the most sanguine expecta-

start of everything mining. May the big venture prosper,
for the men chiefly interested are a game lot. After years
of monkeying by others, the mine was tackled by the
Broken Hillionaires, who, having the pick of nearly every-
thing in Australasia, surely ought to know what they are
about. They conspicuously differ from the Mt. Morgan-
aires, who don’t put back into mining a penny in the £ of
the money they have made and are making in the game.

A N.S.W. contractor’s say-so: “There is no
more use for the contractor now. The department fixes
the prices and the men’s wages, and all the contractor has
to do is to take his bag across to the Treasury, get the
money, and hand it out to the men. None of it sticks to
his hand.” Which is probably the curious reason why
would-be contractors are still falling over each other in
the departmental passages of the Tender Department
and rushing every chance job. They don’t want money ;
they hanker after the chance to commit philanthropy.

The question has been raised as to whether
the N.S.W. Railway Commissioners are justified
in putting up placards at stations and platforms,
cautioning passengers against committing a breach
of the by-laws, and citing cases—giving the names
of offenders —where convictions have been sus-
tained. In England and America cautionary
bills are still published, but no names are given, as
some few years ago a substantial verdict was
given against a co. for defamatory libel. Counsel’s
opinion points out that when an individual has
been fined or imprisoned for an offence, the matter
should end there, as the law has been satisfied;
but to publish a delinquent’s name from month to
month and year after year is calculated to provoke
a breach of the peace, and to do the offender
serious injury. It is alleged that several writs
have been, or are about to be, served on the Rail-
way Dept, claiming heavy damages for slander
and libel on account of these notices.

Dear Bulletin, —Re
that Benalla (Vic.) par-
son and his magic-lan-
tern, a word of warning.
In the days of my youth
a man with a lantern full
of holy slides came to
give exhibitions at our
Sunday - School (Me-
thody) in connection with
the anniversary. It was
a tremendous success
until lights were turned
up rather suddenly, and
Brother Jordan, the sup-
erintendent, was disco-
vered hugging the pale,
ascetic young sister who
taught the second-class
girls. The mischief of
turning up the lights
without warning is ob-
vious. In this instance
the efficacy of a very
zealous teacher was lost
ojr ever, and Brother
Jordan has not to this
day recovered from the
effect of the shock to his
wife’s nervous system.
That Benalla pulpiteer
should cause a bell to be
rung ssec. before crying
“let there be light.”
Light is a very good thing
—in its place.—S.S.
Melb. : “Well-paid
vegetating parsons send
away from Australia to
Asia girls in the bloom
of health, who return
utterly broken down like
a miserable wreck just
brought under my notice.
She was sent from Mel-
bourne to West Bengal!
There she lived in horri-
ble miasma. Mushrooms
and toadstools sprang
through the bedroom
floor in a night, and her
boots would be all mossy
in the morning.”
F. : “Se, Sis, Sim” for “he or she,”
&c. ? A neighbor (age 6) has settled a common
gender for the personal pronoun, third person
singular. He uses “ ser ” (er as in her) for nomina-
tive, possessive and objective of both sexes of the
pronoun—and no one has ever misunderstood him.
In connection with N.S.W. Govt. Astrono'
mer Russell’s nineteen-year cycle-of-drought theory
—supposed to be new —note the following from
More ion Bay Courier, date June 20, 1846 (half a
century ago)
The Rev. W. B. OlarkS, in a recent communication to
S.M.H., expresses his opinion that “Sturt’s desert,”
Leichhardt’s experience ot little or no rain even in the
trorics, SirS. L. Mitchell’s suffering from want of water,
?,r j the state of the colony generally prove this to have
been a year of drought parallel with the season, of 1826-7,
and certainly adding another link to the chain of facts
for establishing an atmospheric cycle of nineteen years.
Truly, nothing is new under the sun ; and it has
taken our scientists half-a-century since the above
was written to re-discover what Mr. Clarke noticed
and wrote about.

The Central Methodist Mission, a number
of never-touch-it associations, and something call-
ing itself the Social Reform League (meaning
Gimlet and Age-of-Consent mysteries chiefly), with
the aid of a brass band, a banner, and lots of
hideous regalia, made Sunday week noisy by
public meeting and blarey procession in the very
centre of Sydney. Yet doth the echo still vibrate
in the public ear of that hoarse shriek of the
“ unco-guid ” against the recent proposed Sabbath
demonstration of the Friendly Societies for the
benefit of the hospitals. Ah ! beloved brethren,
that was a splurge of Beelzebub ! It is an awfu’
thing to disturb the Savvbath calm for the benefit
of the sick and distressed ; it is a powerful, saintly
deed to blather and procesh on the Sawbath in
order to abolish beer and raise the “age of con-
sent. ”

suicided because he suffered from an incurable

unsound mind ” was returned. In keeping with
an old and barbarous law the local authorities
insisted on a burial in the dark, in unconsecrated

Victoria ; and three of the five were at Williams-

Dr. Lloyd, the fatherly old “beak,” of

the other Melb. courts put together. So when an

benignantly:—
Witness (smiling through her spectacles at Dr. Lloyd in
the meantime): “I have lived for 43 years in Hotham,
and, Dr. Lloyd, you know me come Michaelmas for 31
years—dearie me, how the time do fly !”
Dr. Lloyd : “ Pardon me, madam ! I am entirely ignor-
ant of ever seeing you before.”
Witness: “O, yes you do! My poor ma died seven
years ago, and I took a little money out of the bank, and
I went out to buy a pair of garters.”
Dr. Lloyd : “ What’s that to do with the case ?”
Witness : “ I was coming along with the garters in my
hand, and I slipped on a banana-peel and fell through the
window. I had a cockatoo once, Dr. Lloyd, and it flew
away ; and I’ve been 20 years in the one church.”
Then the good old J.P., for almost the first time
m 31 years, ordered a lady to be summarily

Where is the law that will protect the man. The

A leading Sydney daily indicates that the
case of Elizabeth Phillips, whose death some larri-
kins were abortively tried for causing some years
ago, justifies the Mount Rennie judicial slaughter.
The brutal truth about Elizabeth Phillips is
simply this : Whatever the larrikins did they did
when they found her lying drunk, a dead-beat
derelict, semi-moribund, on an ash-heap in
Woolloomooloo. Once she was a beautiful woman
and was “ kept ” by a very rich Sydney merchant!
Then a civil-servant of moderate means took her
in hand ; finally they parted, and she descended
lower and lower in the social scale, finally landing,
dying and destitute, on the ash-heap aforemen-
tioned. High society ruined Elizabeth Phillips
so far as outside agencies could ruin her. Just as
in the bush the blaekfellow throws over his shoul-
der to his gin the bone he has partly picked,
which bone the gin in turn throws over
ker shoulder to the outside circle of expect-
ant dogs so it was with the carc . ase 0 f
the o nce-beautiful Elizabeth Phillips. But it
was old y w fi en the dogs quarrelled over the bones
of the woman that Sydney “ society ” shrieked for

The tone of the Gordon anniversary enter-
tainment at the Freemasons’ Hall, Melb., was
cleverly expressed in the cross-headings of the Age
report—“ An Australian Poets’Night ; Remarks
by Lord Brassey.” And yet, strange to say, the
committee forgot to enrich the programme with a
recitation of Fitz-Gribbon’s “Ode to the bun-
beam,” a specimen of Australian poetry which far
surpasses some of the stuff that comes in for ad-
miring comment.
* * * *
At the so-called Australian Poets’ night,
held at Melb. on the Lindsay Gordon anniversary,
“under the patronage and presence” of Guv-
mentouse and a long string of knights and “nice
people,” the programme of songs and recitations
represented Australian poetry by Gordon, Win.
Gay, Kendall, and Marcus Clarke, three of whom
are, with very few exceptions, totally unfit for
recitative purposes, while Marcus Clarke, though
an excellent versifier, has hitherto never been
accused of being a poet by his best friends. But
the songs and recitations were obviously a mere
peg on which to hang the dreary sandwiched
orations of three or four individuals who desired
to pose in the public eye as critics and patrons of
literature. Gov. Brassey spoke a “piece -a
rambling, steeplechasing speech it was evidently
under the impression that the swallow-tailed
collection before him was composed of local Horners
and Sapphos, and he ladled out wholesome advice
on the penning of iambics in the same spirit
as if advising Sunday-school children to keep in
the path of virtue. T. P. MTnerney also took
the floor, and made a. rew inconsequential remarks
which would nave been equally applicable to the
tick,-,pest or the Amended Factories Act. Prof.
Tucker's observations were principally confined to
picking Gordon to pieces. According to the prof.,
Gordon was guilty of “rugged diction, crude
rhythm, and faulty rhyme ” ; certainly a discovery
in the second instance, as, up to now, everybody
has regarded Gordon as a master of rhythm.
Mr. Tucker also held that future editions of
Gordon should include only his racing ballads,
the ambitious efforts (presumably the “Dedica-
tion,” the “Basket of Flowers,”* and ah
those poems his readers have most revelled
in, including the unsurpassable “Where shall
we gather our garlands glad ”) to be dis-
carded ! The lowest, deepest depth, how-
ever, was reached by Henry Guileless T urner,
who fired off a fulsome laudation of Guy
Boothby, Alex. Sutherland, and other such
people, strangely omitting the Age obituary-
man and Purtell, the football bard! Then
the man of balance-sheets turned, with a heart-
broken voice, to Paterson and Lawson, of
whom he spoke with bated breath, as if he was
saying “blanky” before ladies. “The pheno-
menal sale of the books of these men,” said Turner,
“ causes the judicious (Turner?) to grieve. It is
surprising to find men like Brunton Stephens and
Rolf Boldrewood classing them with Gordon,
solely because their work so closely resembles his
as to be a mere imitation.” Fancy any sane man
who knows enough English to read without having
to spell out the long words seeing the least simi-
larity between Gordon and the two live men !
Gordon wrote horse-ballads and ‘ 1 Banjo wrote
horse-ballads, and there the resemblance of the
two stops short. But between Gordon and Law-
son there is not anywhere the faintest suspicion of
a likeness —not even likeness of subject. The man
who would make such a comparison would accuse
Pattie Brown of stealing Irving’s manner of acting
or charge Pinero with plagiarising George Darrell.
By the way, little or nothing seems to have been
said on the occasion about Victor Daley, far and
away the cleverest of Australian songsmiths—as
will be discovered presently, when his book of
verses comes out.

Gov. Brassey, cycling down a hill at Cam-
berwell (Vic.), last week, lost his pedals, and,
when the accumulated speed had reached a bat
something like Parsons’s best, the front wheel
struck a snag and spilled H.E. on the road. A
scraped nose and jaw were the sum total of the
injuries to God’s anointed, but the mount, though
only slightly damaged, was utterly unndeable.
“ Uncle Tom ” at once solicited the assistance of a
passing boy, to whom he confided his identity,
and, handing the knickerbockered youth half-a-
crown, bade him take the injured jigger to Guv-
mentouse, where a similar coin would await him.
The Baron then trained to Melb., and has since
been sitting in his study gazing pathetically over
the Domain. For neither the small hoy, nor the
bicycle, nor the half-crown has yet turned up.

Northerners fondly imagined they had
settled the tick question by dipping their cattle.
It has, however, just been found that kangaroos,
plain turkeys, and even wild ducks convey the
pest from place to place. Waterfowl acquire the
“ plaguey critters ” from masses of floating vege-
tation, and land birds simply swarm with them.
The only decent remedy shortly will be the soak-
ing of Bananaland in kerosene, turpentine, and
whisky, and allowing the whole country to burn
steadily for a week.

In a case tried recently before the
Northern Supreme Court the defendant was the
wife (European) of a Chow who had levanted.
The lady averred she had sought her spouse
in both China and Japan—but all in vam. It was
suggested in Court for the lady’s comfort that her
husband had probably married again—Chinese
custom being by no means averse to bigamy, inas-
much as John believes that in cases of monogamy
“ she fightee he,” while, with a plurality of wives,
“she fightee she.”

have been built adjoining the schools and here
the head-master is compelled to dwell whether he
likes it or not. Some of these “ vested residences
are too small teacher’s family, while others
are too large, and others are pitched m the most
unsavoury localities. The residence to one Syd-
ney first-class school is built in a dirty cul-de-sac,
and commands an uninterrupted view of a large
assortment of municipal night-carts placed directly
opposite the front-door. The teacher, after
giving the place a fair trial, resolutely refused to
live there, and the place has since been let to an

The isle of Tristan d’Acunha has a popula-
tion of 15 males and 45 females. From the wreck
of the Allanshaw last January there was washed
ashore a solitary man, who was immediately
rushed by the 30 superfluous women, one of whom
wooed him while he was wet, and married him
before he could wash the salt out of his hair. Ihe
29 others are still watching the horizon.*
It is time somebody asked N.S. W. Colonial
Secretary how much Sydney Benevolent Asylum
made last year out of nurse-diplomas at three
guineas each. Also, whether it is in the public
interest to charge such a useful and frequently so
ill-paid a class of women a three-guinea tax for
an official acknowledgment of their competence ?

In a Yic. court re-
cently, a man, whose mar-
riage-engagement had been
broken off, criminally pro-
secuted the girl for larceny
as a bailee of the jewellery
he had given her during
their brief dream of happi-
ness. Also, he exhibited
a document, with the girl’s
alleged signature on it,
acknowledging that she
held the jewellery in trust
only. The girl repudiated
the signature, and, after
the Judge had described
the prosecutor as “ either
a perjurer or a confirmed
scoundrel,” she was acquit,
ted. Fancy giving your
best girl anengagement-

making her sign a bail-

The well-known Melb. abortionist' now
under sentence of death is a tall and remarkably
handsome woman with a nerve of steel. She took
her sentence quite unconcernedly, and, waving
her hand to a pal in the audience, called lra-
la-la, Billy,” without a tremor. Despite the foot
that she has had two “ lets-off ” already, the Ex-
ecutive is unlikely to carry out the death-sentence,
though the death of her client was the result of
sheer carelessness—the use of an unclean instru-
ment —a blunder worse than a crime.
At the trial of the abortionist aforesaid,
some witnesses swore that accused had success-
fully procured abortion with them. This opens
up some phases of enquiry that should whet the
appetites of the Gimlet and Age-of-Consent party.
Is the procuring of abortion a crime? Or is the
crime only in the killing of a patient while
attempting to procure abortion ? Also, if the
abortioner is guilty of a crime, how about the
abortionee? Further (with the Rapiport, &c.,
“conspiracy” case in mind), if the Melbourne
witnesses who swore as hinted above were abor-
tionees, then they were (in an understood sense)
also charged with the accused, and they need not
have given any evidence on that ground.

on the N.S.W. statute-book is chiefly due to the fact that
the man who fashioned the N.S.W. criminal law and was
allowed to boss the criminal justice of the country was a
little wisp of bloodlessness who started life as a Crown-
prosecutor in Vandemonia, where he hanged people for
sheep-stealing. He was allowed to continue his career in
N.S.W., where, not so many years before he became Chief
Justice, he approvingly sentenced to death a wretched
young woman who, pregnant and, therefore, more or less
cranky, had thrown a table-knife at and killed her hus
band. And that Judge, having refused to recommend her
to mercy, she was hanged ; her baby was taken from her

Sydney, June 30, 1896.
Mv Dkar Moorabinda—
The convivial supper given at the Hotel Aus-
tralia by Williamson and Musgrove to farewell the
Trilbyites and welcome the Chinatown co., was a
great success. Of course, the new co. were a little
rocky (having only landed that morning after a
voyage that was rather a nightmare—especially, it
appears, to the plump tenor, who had a misfit
berth all the way) and there was a disposition to
hail the waiter as “steward” on the part of the
new co., which is a very nice co. seen without its
paint. Also, lam led to believe that the morale
of the procession is good. When the genial
J.C.W., in his happily-delivered speech, touched
on the fact of there being few amusements for
actors out of business hours in Australia—no
players’ clubs, for instance—a male voice cheer-
fully chipped in : “No matter ; we’re all married.”
And so all the men are—with one exception, but
which one he is I will not divulge out of mercy to
a lonely stranger who may not know how to pro-
tect himself in foreign parts.
Cigarettes went round for the ladies, but none
of them smoked—not even Trilby ? whom some
people accused of enjoying her “ business ” smokes
in the play. And I was interested to see that the
girl who kicked highest in “ Trilby ” drank lemon-
ade. Everything was orthodox—if you except
that one of the new co. took two arms and a long
time to re-tie the neck-scarf of the jovial “ Trilby ”
stage-manager, although the scarf looked to me to
be all right; but there are some women who hate
to see a man’s tie going awry. The supper-tables
were full of interest, and one caught glimpses of
many well-known faces between the jonquils and
ferns of the decorations. At the “ disciples ” end
J.C.W. sat between Edith Crane, in a dark dress
spotted with blue and a regular garden of natural
crimson roses in her hair and on her corsage, and
Bessie Clayton, premiere danseuse of the new co.,
who is 18 years old and has been married two
years, but who looks like an infant (stage variety)
in spite of it.
Then came Svengali Fax, too tired to make a
speech and wearing a lightning-rod-canvasser’s
costume, and he was balanced on the other side by
Harry Conor, funny-man-in-chief of the new co.,
who made a temperance oration which wasn’t
audible at my end of the festive board. The most
soul-stirring Chinatown youth seen at a private
view is Arthur Pacie, the tenor, whose wife, a
charming little woman, is along too, let me warn
the d.c. The Chinatown girls (who are not so
married as the Chinatown youths) have a refined
style and a tricky way of dressing reminiscent of
the Gee Gees. At the supper all—barring Patrice
—wore high frocks, and they mostly sported ab-
surd little theatre-toques (if you can give such a
matter-of-fact name to airy arrangements of a
sprinkle of aggressive rosebuds and a paste buckle
or so) which gave a novel appearance to the supper-
table. And the vocabulary of the newcomers was
fresh, too. “ I was hypering daown street,” for
example, is a phrase that cannot be cleared at one
mental leap. And when you are suddenly advised
to “ get a hustle ” it takes outside assistance to let
you know that you are only being asked to hurry
up. Among the guests invited to the supper were
Mr. and Mrs. Brough, Mr. and Mrs. Bland Holt,
Mr. George Darrell, dear old Harwood, Mr. and
Mrs. Treasurer Goodman, and others.
The English Concert Co. brought out by Stevens,
Basse, and Howell—the enterprising trio whose
last trump was Mark Hambourg, you remember—
opened at Sydney Centenary Hall in the presence
of Gov. and Lady Hampden and the usual V.R.
semi-scoop which bites a good bit out of the
reserved chairs. Novelties about the English co.
were that the men didn’t wear gloves, and that
the programmes were books of the words a la
Liedertafel bills—a useful help “ when singers
sing in chorus,” but which leads one to surmise
that the artists are prone to chew the libretto when
only soloists are in question. This, however, was
not the case.
The importations are four strong. Mass Thudi-
chum, the soprano, is tall and dark, with a well-
cultivated and expressionful voice and a pro-
nounced taste in dress —geranium-red silk is
rather aggressive. And when Miss T. came on
and stated in high relief that her “ love was like a
flaming sword,” I couldn’t help thinking that her
taste in dress matched her affections. Miss
M'Kenzie, the contralto, is plump and fair, and
do butted in scrumptious white satin brocade
faked with gold and silver, trhs-decollete and
long-tailed, as if most of the bodice material had
melted into the skirt. Her warble is a small,
sweet contralto with a similar range, I should
think, to that possessed by the baritone of the
“Autocrat of the Breakfast'Table,” and is.free
from the masculine quality which distinguishes
other contraltos—Miss Nagel, for example. Of
the men of the party, baritone Douglas Powell
runs away with the public fancy. He is an aide-
de-campish youth with a lovely gloss on his linen
and a curly mo., and he has what I would
describe as a very clever voice. It is not very big
or bouncing, but it is always well-pitched, clear,
direct and unaffected, without a suspicion of exag-
geration or straining unduly after effect, although
he lets himself go and doesn’t spare the agony.
Mr. Powell was popular from the jump—with a
fatal popularity which means double encores and,
alas, double work. But he seems to revel in it.
Mr. Edward Branscombe (a “lay vicar,” whatever
that may mean) is a pale, be-ringed tenor with a
carefully-trained moustache and a leaning for
pianissimo in the upper register—which appeals to
the cultivated few so long as it is understood that
the gentleman can howl like forty dingoes at the
same altitude if needs be. A tenor who always
tapers off to a womanish whisper cannot hope to be
the apple of the Sydney public’s eye, which prefers
a vocalist who appears to be bursting his collar-
stud. Herr Vollmar gave delightful music on his
’cello, and J. Eyebrows Sykes accompanied with
his usual aplomb.
Another concert on the same evening was
“ Daddy ” Hallewell’s pupils’ splash at Sydney
Y.M.C.A. The budding vocalists gave Daddy
the best advt. he ever had in his life, several of the
singers being of the “coming” variety. Haydn,
Meyerbeer, Gounod, and Blumenthal were some
of the “tough” composers tackled by the Halle-
well students.
The new Yankee co. broke loose energetically in
“A Trip to Chinatown,” at Sydney Lyceum, last
Saturday, before a house crammed to the top
shingle—and it was noticeable, too, that the nearer
people got to the shingles the greater success they
considered the performance—though it is as idle
to seriously “ consider ” musical trifles of this sort
as it would be to hold an inquest on a dead butter-
fly. The chief charm of this kind of assault on
common sense is that deep-thinking is fatal to it—
you can spoil a musical trifle by bringing too much
logic to bear on it, just as easily as you can spoil
champagne with sodawater. The dressing of the
“ trifle ” was suitably gay. Geraldine M'Cann, as
the Widow, mostly looked like the girl who gets
sketched on the forefront of smart picture-papers.
Her first dress of black satin, smothered in jet,
and made with jutting skirt and sprouting sleeves,
produced the best effect, for her second garment
was so like No. 1, with the sleeves lopped off, that
it hardly counted. The harlequin masquerade
frock in black and white was Erenchy, but Miss
M‘Cann (weird sort of nom-de-theatre for a girl to
choose) best proved her title to good looks by look-
ing her sonsiest as a grey Quakeress in a demure
little bonnet.
Sadie MacDonald, as the French maid, without
whom no musical trifle is complete, was principally
attired in bows of ribbon—her prettiest turn-out
being cinnamon and cherry-color, and her most
gorgeous a “ mermaid ” costume of sea-green satin
and lace, with hat foaming with feathers. Nellie
Butler’s chiefest garment was a wallpapery-yellow-
red-and-green brocade, and Miss Stone was remi-
niscent of the guest in grand opera in her blue
evening-dress, but her pretty singing-voice atoned
for the absence of ginger in her toilet. Miss Stone
has the prettiest voice in the co. As it was with
the departed Gee-Gees, the alleged prima-donna of
the expedition has the smallest voice of the lot.
The Chinatown ladies believe in lots of make-up,
but I scarcely see the reason of the ’Murkan trick
of painting the outside of the nostrils red. Nellie
Butler was the worst offender in this respect. But,
perhaps, it’s only a fleeting fad, picked up when
influenza had the floor, and a red nose was a sign
of distinction? That’s what it suggests, at any
rate.
Bessie Clayton, the premiere danseuse, is a most
peculiar dancer. Her toe-solo suggests a play of
strong emotions as much as a frantic pas-seul.
When she flopped at the finish in a limp bundle
on the floor she looked to me like the husk of a
maiden after the seven devils of dancing had got
away with her soul. Miss Clayton’s dancing is
most bizarre and unearthly—one might almost say
demoniac—and if her taste in dress was corres-
pondingly fantastic her “turn” would be a very
magnetic item. But her whole appearance was
raw, and her frock abjectly commonplace—a point-
less pink-and-white mixture with black gloves
several inches too short to be effective. A girl
who can dance like that ought to prefer rather to
suggest one of Macbeth’s witches than the belle of
a suburban tea-party—when she’s got ’em all on.
The author’s folks are cheap in “Chinatown.”
Willie Grow (played by Patrice), for instance, an-
nounces himself as an agent for perfumes,
whereat the girls pat him rapturously on the back!
Now, in the Gee-Gees’ farce, “In Town,” the
“ boy ” was a peer—Lord Clanside. Therefore, 1
wasn’t surprised in “A Trip to Chinatown” when
one of the gay young sparks shook hands with the
waiter at the supper-club—it seemed to be quite
in keeping with the general atmosphere. Though
perhaps lam wrong. To shake hands with the
waiter may be the latest diplomacy of the creamiest
men of the world when you come to seriously con-
sider the affair.
The Trebelli concert last Friday evening at
Sydney Town Hall plainly proved that, in the
vocal world, the comet may sometimes have a rag-
tail without disastrous results. Never was there a
concert from which the padding protruded so un-
mistakeably, and yet, to the confusion of Sydney
audiences be it said, all hands got loud recalls.
Madame Trebelli, in pale peach-pink satin
brocade with soft lace and diamonds, sang ex-
quisitely, the large hall being just the right size
for her obedient voice. Everything she sang
gained treble recalls, her last encore being Patti’s
“Laughing Song,” of which Trebelli gives the
finest Australian rendering ujj to date. And as a
reward for her finished and charming vocalisation
somebody handed Madame a wreath of laurel big
enough to fit the late Premier Parkes. These in-
discriminate garlands of honor irritate me beyond
measure. Imagine the cool egotism of a person of
no social or official importance solemnly handing
bay leaves to an artist! They treat the solemn
and sacred wreath of laurel, which can only come
backed by the applause of nations, as if it was so
much sarsaparilla—in Sydney everybody gets
crowned with gum until the circlet loses all signi-
ficance. Edgar ’cello Strauss really assisted at the
Trebelli concert, and J. E. Sykes accompanied—
not forgetting a German youth, Herr Scheinpflug,
who played Trebelli’s flute accompaniments in a
style reminiscent of Lemmone.
From W. H. Paling and Co. I have lately re-
ceived the “Delightful” gavotte, by W. A. Caf-
lisch, conductor of the Brisbane Liedertafel.
“ The Delightful ” is a pleasant composition in the
conventional gavotte style, which is so full of rests
and staccato marks that the person who plays it
always looks Ike a cat on hot bricks. I am also
in receipt of the “Florence, schottische by J.
Holland. A very excellent portrait of Flo Young
livens up the cover, but the music is of the most
tin-pot description. Mr. Holland approaches a
charming actress under the guise of melody, and
gets everything into his programme but the music.
Next Thursday (July 9th) Lady Hampden opens
the N.S.W. Poultry, Pigeon, Canary, and Dog
Society’s annual champion show at Sydney Exhi-
bition Building. I hear that the entries in the
poultry sections are “numerous and handsome,”
and the staging of the birds and 1 beasts will receive
special attention. A. J. Gray, Eldon Chambers,
is still hon, sec. to the society. On July Bth the
Chemists’ Assistants’ annual ball takes' place at
Paddington Town Hall; on the 10th the steam-
ship officials’ invitation-dance occurs at the same
place ; and on 20th the council and committee of
the Institute of Bankers and of the Australasian
Economic Association give a conversazione at the
Equitable Buildings, from 8 to a quarter to 11, at
which Gov. Hampden will be present.
There is, after all, some gratitude in the world.
Mrs. MacDonald (nee Kate Slattery), one of
Sydney’s most philanthropic vocalists, was recently
presented with an illuminated address and enter-
tained at a ball and banquet by the residents of
Thornleigh (Milson’s Point line), as a token of
gratitude for Mrs. MacDonald’s charitable efforts
to raise money for the local poor by a series of con-
certs. By this means she raised £7B, for which the
grateful inhabitants now publicly testimonialise
her. The address is on view in Paling’s window.
A National Council of Women is the newest
women-suffrage spasm in Sydney. The inaugural
meeting was held in the Centennial Hall the other
Friday (the new woman is evidently not super-
stitious), and Lady Hampden, who had been some-
how lassoed into the chair, made far and away the
cleverest speech. Lady H., of course, expressed
her pleasure at being present, though she really
had no idea what sort of object the gathering had
in view—whether it was a scheme for the abolition
of everything, or merely a friendly discussion as
to the psychological reasons why thin-legged
women object to Bloomers. So her Ex. gracefully
and diplomatically confessed that she was there as
a figurehead before the secretary had time to com-
promise her.
When all the chaff is blown away the wheat of
the National Council of Women is that another
grabby association is being violently thrust on the
public in order that the emancipated society old
maids of itinerant tendencies and lots of time both
before and behind ’em may have the chance of
careering from Dan to Beersheba as “delegates”
attending female conferences, where they justify
their existence in waves of jaw-jaw mountains high.
And, although the National Council of Women
sounds an expansive order, embracing, one would
think, the votes of a nation of intelligent females,
it is after all only another frantic attempt of the
old, forlorn suffrage jackdaws—with “Lady Hamp-
den in the chair, and Lady Darley vice-president,”
as the fabled disguising peacock’s feathers.
The complimentary benefit concert tendered by
the musicians of Sydney to organist Wiegand in
the Centennial Hall last Saturday, attracted the
biggest paying crowd ever jammed into that vast
building. Gov. and Lady Hampden and daughters
had dreadful positions in 'the very van of the con-
cert, where they couldn’t see the performers with-
out cricking their necks, and where the noise must
have been deafening. The V.R. dressing was
principally top wrap, the gayest item on the carpet
of patronage being a glorious basket of committee
flowers. In the interval the hero of the evening
M. Wiegand, was presented to Gov. Hampden
at His Ex. ’s special request, and that pleasant-
mannered potentate expressed his joy at the suc-
cess of the whole thing, although, judging by the
desperate manner in which H.E. grasped himself
bv the scruff of the neck, all the evening, it
almost looked as if he had to hold himself back
from es aping into the night.
The weak point of the Wiegand concert was
that there was too much organ - it got to sound as
it the City Council were working a bit of overtime
out. of Mons. W. so as to get ahead of his six
months spell. The programme was long and
effective. Madame Kellerman (who wore a verv
elegant mauve silk and got a great reception oil'
her first appearance after her recent trip to Euro lie)

A Sydney bazaar lately attended by Lady
Hampden was an amazing turn-out. There were
four stalls, each about the size of a small toilet-
table, whereon were exposed for sale articles of an
inconceivably trumpery kind. No wonder the
aide, who stalked behind the Government House
party, laughed behind his hat as by V.R. orders
ne purchased six-pennyworth of gingerbread. I
shan’t wonder if, after this experience, Lady
Hampden declines to visit any bazaar at which the
show has not previously been inspected by one of
the vice-regal suite.
Writes my Melb. correspondent :
“ The promoters of the Seamen’s Institute Con-
cert, at Port Me 1 bourne, held a grand hand of
trumps in the promise of two songs by a real live
Earl, as many more from the Governor’s son-in-
law, and 10 minutes of ‘ hum-hum, er-er, and
yah-yah ’ oratory from the vice-regal Ancient
Mariner himself. But some people would sing
small if they had at their beck and call for the
charity platform the services of Her Most Gracious
and Albert Edward with his banjo. At all events,
the faint-hearted Port Melbournians parted with
their advantages dirt-cheap—two shillings each for
the very best seats.
“ The thrill of the evening came when Earl
Shaftesbury proceeded to try conclusions with
‘ The Bloom is on the Rye ! ’ Pink facings and
nine beauteous gold buttons, ‘ three down each
side and the same up the middle’ (as audibly
enumerated by a long-shore mermaiden), were all
in his favor, and he was tumultuously encored.
All the same, his wrinkled white vest, as here-
tofore, was palpably in need of judicious
‘ boning.’ Willowy Lord Hopetoun put his
whole trust in whalebone ; and the one Earl of the
Brassey menage, plump though he be, might do
worse than follow his example. To return to the •
programme, the singer’s vocal treatment of his
‘pretty Jane’ was tunefully insinuating. What
with a sweet tenor voice and unaffected utterance,
even male hearers found only one fault—the per-
former’s mannerism of wriggling in his bits of
things as if, in musical ecstasy, he meditated an
upward flight, leaving behind him buttons, weskit
and all.
“For some reason, the entertainment suffered
from a congestion of mayoralty, which, from a
non-municipal point of view, had its drawbacks.
In the end, when the City Fathers grew dazed
with sitting too long in a speechless row near an
unrestrained piano, they apparently conceived the
delusion that a Council-meeting was in progress.
At all events, they moved and seconded like mad,
and proposed votes of thanks to all and sundry,
especially the various mayors. Then the latter
called upon one another to respond for the ladies,
just as if it was a wedding, and everyone declined
the office on the ground that his own private,
particular mayoress was present. Finally, they
shifted the task on to surgeon O’Hara, who had
sung four songs, and now rose from his seat in the
hall to protest that he’d done his duty, though he
offered in compensation to cut off a mayoral leg if
required. Meanwhile the audience, which had
paid to get in, took this display of excessive grati-
tude calmly, and joined in singing ‘ God Save ’ for
the second time that evening without audible
demur. Halfway through the glory of the night
had departed with the Governor, who was due
elsewhere, and carried off both his aides, though
each was down for a second song. After CO, when
a man’s had his own say, what else does he care
about ?
“Signor Buzzi, Melbourne’s most successful
singing-instructor, suffering from severe ill health,
is returning to Italy. The fair sex of Melbourne
adore Buzzi, who is on the concert platform what
the beauteous Ryley was on the stage.
“ Suburban mayors are rampant. They have all
altered the dates of their civic hops several times
to suit vice-regal convenience, and the latest de-
velopment is that the autocratic Gov. has thrown
them all over. Mayor Nathan, of Richmond,
changed his date three times, and finally fixed upon
the evening Lord B. named. Three days after-
wards he received a letter stating that tlie Royal
Figurehead had finally decided to be absent from
Melbourne at the time. It is shrewdly suspected
that some of the other suburban potentates will
have to share Mr. Nathan’s cruel fate.
“ The Caledonian ball, as a social function, is a
thing of the past, and this year’s rally of the braw
Scot was a pronounced frost. Vice-royal tv arr i ved
a few hours late, and was led into the hall by a
party of pipers, preceded by a magnificently meaty
specimen of a Highlander. After some agonised
rushing hither and thither, the first set was made
up, but with the wrong people included, whereat
the right people ground their false teeth and
smiled bitterly. A cosy nook had been contrived
in the ballroom, behind a screen, where the extra
special vice-regal supper was laid. Even this
proved a failure. His Ex. flatly refused to be
privately enclosed by a screen, and insisted upon
patronising the general refreshment-room. Falls,
partial or complete, were a frequent cause of bad
language. The noble Shaftesbury, when waltzing
with a Potteresque damsel, by strenuous exertion,
just managed to save himself from an undignified
cropper, and, at one awful point of the proceed-
ings, Lord B.’s equilibrium trembled in the bal-
ance. However, the great man made a clever
recovery, and the Caledonian ball breathed
again. ”

POLITICAL
POINTS
S.A. Agent-General Play ford will probably
resign before Christmas, and S.A. politicians al-
ready speculate about his successor. The two
most likely are Treas. Holder and Speaker Coles,
with odds in favor of the former.
One outside contractor, who could give
weighty evidence re departmental blundering, was
approached by Varney Parkes re the Carter-
Gummow Commission ; but he didn’t bite. The
amount involved was about <£ll,ooo.
The N.S.W. Lands for Closer Settlement
Bill has apparently dropped out of sight. And
people have almost given up wondering whose
land was to be resumed behind the back of Parlia-
ment if that amazing measure got through.
Jock MTntyre, who is vaguely understood
to lead the Vic. Opposition, has only one fault to
find with the Govt, just now. It gets too much
fulsome praise to please Jock—who, by the way,
was never fulsomely praised himself when he was
a Minister.
The public mind of Australia is fairly ripe
now for the consideration of a Bill to abolish all
State gratuities except those conferred on the
f round of poverty. Free passes on railways, and
tate deadheadism of every kind, should be
brought under vote.
‘ ‘ Frank Cotton the first to impress the
Single-tax on the Australian mind ! ” Why, in
1878 Prof. Pearson wrote in Melb. Age a series of
articles in favor of taxing the unearned increment.
The Georges, the Cottons, and others would profit
by reading those articles.
Rockhampton politicians, not content with
soliciting Max O’Rell’s assistance to boom Separa-
tion, recently interviewed Governor Lamington
thereon. Outside Rockhampton the Separation
barometer is down to zero. In the North (which
fears Townsville domination) and in Townsville
itself the movement is, apparently, dead as Caesar.
In Centralia the western towns make a laughing-
stock of the Autonomy question ; and, even in
Mt. Morgan, next door to Rockhampton, the
people smile a weird and weariful smile of half
contemptuous amusement when the matter is
mentioned.
What’s in a

This ingenious jour-
nal has lately in-
vented the term
“ Constitutionalist ”
as a synonym for
Boodl e wr aithi sm.
The insinuation that
the Labor-party seeks
to attain its ends by
methods unconstitu-
tional is too false for
contradiction.
M.L. Premier
Seddon persistently
sits on the rail re
secular education. But
then ex - Democrat
Stout, now playing
strongly for the Tory
leadership, has always
been an aggressive
champion of secular
schools—and was, in
fact, once chiefly
known as a sort of
semi-prof essio nal
atheist. His long
and forcibly avowed
agnostic convictions
prevent him from
effectively “ round-
ing ” on the education
question, so Seddon
keeps the education
card up his sleeve
and smiles softly to
himself, while the
Wellington Post
and other Tory jour-
nals yell themselves
hoarse in unavailing
demands that he
shall declare himself.
They aren’t up to
Dick!
Graham Berry’s pension is supported by
the Tories, opposed by the Rads. The whirligig
of time ! In one decade, Berry the Dictator, the
Revolutionary, the accursed of all men in black
clothes ! Another decade, Graham Berry, Speaker,
at the Melbourne Club ball!
One of David Syme’s forms of revenge is to
sulk in his paper. John Hancock, Labor-member,
has been prominent in championing Syme’s
enemy, Speight. Syme’s opportunity came when
Hancock spoke on the Address in Parliament.
His speech was reported at a quarter of a column’s
length in the Tory Argus, but the self-styled
liberal Age dismissed it in two lines, thus :
Mr. Hancock made some remarks on Socialism and other
subjects.
This is Hancock’s punishment for presuming to
say a word in favor of Syme’s foe.
The elected of the Sydney Parliamentary
constituency of Gipps and the rejected of that
constituency now sit as equally-paid members of
N.S.W. Public Works Committee, and as members
of the Legislature, with practically equal political
powers. Which shows what an idiot the Public is
when it calls its sacrosanct ballot-box the Will of
the People.
Hughes, M.P., forecast, the other night, a
coalition between Premier Reid and Opposition-
leader Lyne. And why the incredulity excited.
Has not Australia already produced a Griffith-
M.‘ll wraith, a Berry-Service, and a Parkes-Robert-
son coalition ? And, only a few months ago, did
not a Dibbs-Parkes coalition brazenly uplift its
countenance ?
British House of Lords has passed by 29
majority the second reading of the Deceased
Wife’s Sister Marriage Act long-murdered by the
bishops. Canada has thrown out a Ministry
which endeavored to cram denominational educa-
tion down the throat of Manitoba —the lay
Catholics of Quebec assisting ! Everywhere
ecclesiasticism is weakening.
The branding of Chinese-made furniture,
as proposed by the N.S.W. Shops and Factories
Bill, can be defended plausibly enough by Protec-
tionism, but it is not Freetrade. In fact, almost
everything the Freetrade Reid Govt, does, or pro-
poses to do, provokes the howl from its ruck,
“This is agen our Freetrade principles.” The
Reid opportunism is not Freetrade.
It is an insult to civilisation for anyone
who took part in or approved of the methods of the
infamous Mount Rennie trial to offer ‘ ‘ mercy ” to
the surviving prisoners. They were citizens, and
as such were surely entitled to_ as‘deliberate and
dispassionate a trial as is ordinarily given in a
promissory-note dispute. Instead of which they
got a trial which would have disgraced Judge
Lynch.
The terrible catastrophe at Moscow, where-
by 8000 hungry citizens were killed or injured,
seems to have ended in a terribly funny joke for
the cablegrammer. “ During the course of the
inquiry- evidence was given implicating several
high officials of the empire in the disaster. The
Czar thereupon stopped the inquiry, and a verdict
was returned that the catastrophe was the act oi
God. ” The high officials were acting for the A 1
mighty, as usual.
Melbourne Age in effect issues orders that
Premier Turner is not to levy extra taxation to
make up the deficit, but trusts things righting
themselves next year. On this point it is time for
Turner and Syme to part company. Finance is
the weak point in all the Australian Governments,
and there are always too many of them trusting
that things will “come right.” The business of
the Treasurer is to seize things with both hands
and put them right.
In Queensland premises used for “ church
purposes” are exempt from taxation, and this
system has been brought to such a state of perfec-
tion that if services are habitually held on a vacant
allotment it thereby dodges the tax. Therefore,
FOREIGNERS.—(A Melbourne Sketch from Life.)
Fat Man encourages public worship on his corner
block to keep down the expenses till a buyer comes
along. In all the Australias the church dodges
taxation more or less —which is the old endowment
business in a mean, underhand, objectionable
form. If the aggregate church property of a pro-
vince escapes, by this process of exemption, .£5OOO
per annum of local and general taxation, then the
rest of the community must pay it. Therefore,
the churches are compulsorily endowed to that
extent by a community which thinks it has abol-
ished State aid to religion.
Although the N.S.W. Opposition declined
to help the N.S.W. Labor-members to torpedo
the Reid Government over the iniquitous Tooth
Brewery business, the same Opposition expected
the same Labor-members to help it to torpedo the
same Government over one of the minor expletives
of the Dean Curse.
Sydney Daily Telegraph clamorously
backs up a plebiscite as the best means of ascer-
taining the public will on all questions—except
Freetrade. That, says the D.T., has been settled
by “as distinct an expression of public opinion
as a plebiscite could bring forth.” Of course.
That is the D.T.’s fiscal doxy.
A FACT,—OUTSIDE KIDMAN'S.

Q. Parliamentarians are open to the charge
of having reduced payment of members from =2300
to £l5O a year, to prove that the pruning-kmfe
applied by the hand of depression was no respec-
ter of persons, and of now reconstructing them-
selves to <£3oo, “ from the return of the writ,
leaving the retrenched and exiled, mostly the
socially and politically friendless, in the cold,
wintry “soup.”
The formation of the S.A. Liberal Associa-
tion, with a programme almost on all-fours with
the announced Govt, policy, has completely taken
the wind out of the Ass party’s sails. b.A. pro-
ducers, prejudiced against some of the Labor-
party’s proposals, cordially detest lat Man s
proposed abolition of members’payment and free
education, and the new association just strikes the
happy mean. The Ass press, in its anger, de-
scribes the new league as a “ Labor move !
Melb. Argus celebrated the jubilee of Free-
trade, last week, with -a sub-leader that warmed
the very cockles of Fat Man’s soul. Thus : It
was on June 25, 1846, that the repeal of the Corn
Laws was finally passed by the House of Lords,
and on the following day the touch of the Royal
sceptre swept away those and. a hundred other
burdensome duties.’’ Welike “ touch of the Royal
sceptre ” well enough, but why not “ wave of the
monarchial wand ” ?
A series of articles on “ old age pensions,”
by a well-known Australian writer, have been
appearing in the Argus. He seemed to have a
free hand in the treatment, and the first two
articles were worthy of the Democratic press,
although their trend was skilfully repudiated m
the leading-columns. But after the second ap-
peared, and a lot of people had furiously enquired
why this Socialistic stuff was appearing, the
articles tailed off into the usual Argus style of
thing.
How does solicitor X. feel when sending a
brief to Premier Y. ? Are there not many little
State services which Premier Y. may do for
solicitor X. ; and when X. persuades a client
that Y. is just the man to have influence with the
court, is it possible he is wholly unmindful of
these possibilities ? Again, is it quite the irre-
proachable thing for Premier Y. to plead before
District Court Judges whose elevation to the
Supreme Court Bench is largely conditional upon
Y. ’s favor ?
Chief Secretary Brunker’s probably earnest
assertion that “ everything possible in the way of
home comforts” —pause and consider, individual
reader, what you would mean by “home com-
forts” —is supplied “without stint” to the in-
mates of N.S.W. Asylums, is an instance of the
gullibility of red-tapeism. Brunker thinks so,
and Brunker-sent reporters say so, because when-
ever Brunker or a Brunker envoy visits an asylum,
the whole caboose and its administration are
readied-up. No inspectorial eyes are ever let see
behind the scenes in any “ Guv’ment institoo-
shun.” If the Public Service Board wants to
know the truth about matters, let them connive at
a dummy pauper going through all the rigors, of
“ the system.” Or let the Government examine
“ cantankerous ” paupers, guaranteeing them pro-
tection from subsequent official retaliation.
Ex-Chief Justice Lilley on those silken
bonds “ Why should we [Australians] depend
for our peace on the Sultan’s pleasure, or a frown
of a Fatima or Haidee, or on a lapse by Ayesha,
or on the Czar’s liver or surfeit of cabbage-soup,
or on the divine German Wilhelm’s disgust with
das Enylischer blut in his Imperial veins ?”
Gov. Brassey’s speech reports that the loss
of traffic occasioned by the failure of the harvest
has caused a serious deficiency in the income
derived from Yic. railways during the current
financial year. Among the railway hands it is
roundly declared that the bad harvest was cpiite
as much as the rolling-stock could carry, anyhow.
The N.S.W. lawyer-bossed
Ministry which, in the interest
of the legal trades-union, has
steadfastly blocked all discussion
concerning the merits of the
brand of justice dispensed by
Mr. Justice Windeyer, cannot
escape putting that official in
the Parliamentary pillory should
it desire to have the province
pay a portion of his Privy
Council salary. But the ques-
tion can hardly arise. That the
rest of the Australias should be
willing to let a man with Mr.
Windeyer’s judicial record re-
present this country on any
tribunal is absolutely incon-
ceivable. There are at least
several dozen members of N. S.
Wales Assembly who would
vote for Mr. Justice Windeyer’s
dismissal from the bench were
the matter fully debated —and
there are not, The Bulletin
believes, 20 men in the House
who would vote him a shilling,
except for the purpose of get-
ting permanently rid of him.
The Lord Justices of the Privy
Council get =BOOOO a year salary
—and just think of the Aus-
tralia which makes such a mouth
over paying just about half the
money to a Railway Commis-
sioner who gives big value for
his salary, shelling out sixty
hundred pounds every year to
enable Lord Justice Windeyer
of Tomago to wear silk stockings
and flash his Dover at London
dinners !
Sundry Chinese lottery-
runners, prosecuted by Vic.
Crown Law Department at
Smellboume District Court, the other day, had
put their defence in the hands of Premier Turner’s
firm. The moral of this is quite clear. No solicitor
ought to be connected with the Government.
N.S.W. “ Lands ” Minister Carruthers will
either have to “ take a pull ” or get a little Par-
liament of his own specially to pass Land Bills.
He has still a lot to learn on the land-question,
and had much better stop tinkering and sit down
and think hard for a couple of years. Also read
Kipling’s little story, “ Tod’s Amendment,” and
let the moral soak in well. The Minister means
well, but his leg is too pullable and his methods
show a shocking lack of repose.
As a practical effect of the working of pay-
ment by results in education. A week or two ago
(writes a Bulletin correspondent) a messenger
from the headmaster of a Melb. district State
school interviewed several parents with the object
of inducing them to keep certai n of their children
at home for a month. The reason assigned for the
peculiar request was that the said children were
above the proper class age, and that their presence
would seriously affect the class results. On one
parent saying that to do so would bring him under
the provisions of the compulsory clauses of the
Act, he was informed that he need have no fear on
that score, as the head-master would see that he
was not proceeded against !
It is proposed that a conference of
Premiers be held to nominate an Australian Judge
to sit on the judicial committee of the British
Privy Council. A much more urgent need is a
conference to consider the hideous foolishness of
sending an Australian Judge 16,000 miles to hear
Australian cases, and making the cases go 16,000
miles after him and 16,000 miles home again, when
the same Judge might as well sit as a court of
appeal here and hear the same cases on the spot.
When Premier Reid wants his boots soled he
doesn’t send the shoemaker to England, and then
send the boots after him, and afterwards have
them sent back again ; he has them soled here.
Why not have his law soled here also ?
Item from Melbourne, last Thursday : —-
Mr. Finlayson, the Crown Prosecutor, applied to-day to
Mr. Justice A’Becket for the issue of a warrant for Geake’s
arrest. The application was granted.
Solicitor Geake was convicted of some very large
frauds and released, pending appeal, on A2OO bail,
which was practically a case of tying an alligator
to a straw to prevent it getting away. Geake got
away quite easily, the police apparently taking no
interest in his movements, and two weeks after
his departure is publicly known the Crown rises
up in haste and gets a warrant for his capture !
The awful velocity with which it only waits two
weeks before beginning to move in the matter
seems to show that the Crown is in a good state
of trainingand fit to run for its life in a stationary
manner, so to speak.

This is as it should be. The public
expected the opening statement which
J was made by sir .John MTntvrb in
"the Assembly, yesterday, that no
, attempt would be made by the Opposi-
tion to block the consideration of
public business by any hostile motion,
but that the Government business will
be fully and-rairiy considered on its
merits as that business is brought
forward. Any other course would have

Henry Lawson, who emphatically believes
that far-off fields are green, is on his way to Wes-
tralia.
He has arrived at last. S.M. Herald says
that Mr. Modest Maryanski, an American mineral-
ogist bound for Coolgardie, was a passenger per
the Warrimoo.
Ex-Speaker O’Rorke (M.L.) says that the
Seddon Government is giving the Maoriland
Upper House “ rope enough to dig its own
grave ” ! O’Rorke is a bhoy from Galway.
Many Sydneyites will be sorry to hear
that, when the mail left London, “Charley” Lett
was laid up, suffering from cerebral hemorrhage.
The doctors, however, expected him to pull round.
F. B. Suttor, politically quiescent at pre-
sent, has held office in N.S.W. Ministries for a
longer period, adding the occasions together, than
any other now alive. The late Parkes used to
“ top ” him.
Overheard at Melb. Law Courts the other
day : “ Hello, what case are you in ? ” “ They’re
appealing from a judgment in our favor.” “ itow
will it go ? ” “ Oh, we’re sure to lose—it’s one of
the Chief’s decisions.”
A Melb. solicitor who appeared for two
smellful justices in a recent inquiry, avers that
he has up his sleeve a card wherewith to work the
confusion of the teetotal beak primarily respon-
sible for his clients’ undoing.
During June no less than eight of Vic.
Chief Justice Madden’s judgments have been
appealed against, and of these the whole six
already reviewed have been reversed by the Full
Court. Even Griffith smiles.
When N.S.W. Speaker Abbott has ’em all
on—when he puts on the medals, ribbons, and
other insignia of his numerous offices in societies,
lodges, companies, and so forth, his capacious bust
is covered all but three sq. in.
The new N.S.W. Sheriff, Mr. Maybury, is
son-in-law of the late “Bob” Wisdom, Q.C.,
erstwhile N.S.W. Attorney-General, who went
within one vote of election as Speaker when
Wigram Allen was first chosen.
Miss Cowper, sister of the ex-Sheriff, and
daughter of an ex-N.S.W. Premier, is the only
lady who has a free pass over the N.S.W. State
railways—“because her father took part in the
introduction of railways into the colony. ”
Pious Brentnall, M.L.C., elected the
other day to the chair of Q. Leg. Council, was,
when at the Wesleyan Conference in Sydney 18
months ago, the sole articulate apologist for the
presence of the Kanaka in Queensland towns.
H : “ I was present when boomster G. W.
Taylor, at Dr. Bevan’s Melb. church, made his
offer of <£50,000 to the Congregational denomina-
tion. He carefully unfolded it, bit by bit, and
the yells of delight went nigh to lift the roof. ”
Journalist: “The mention of ex-beak
Baxter as a Tas. pensioner reminds me of a case
I once reported. The pensioned ex-Postmaster-
General of one of the Australian provinces was
fined <£2 for writing inside a posted newspaper.”
The much-injured and historical Mrs.
George Dean, and her mother, Mrs. Seymour, are
still running the little Surry Hills grocery. Busi-
ness isn’t brisk, but the gossips who come in for a
penn’orth of what they don’t want help to pay the
rent.
Ex-soiicitor Meaghe’: of Dean case noto-
riety, starts on a lecturing-tour through the
N.S.W. country districts early in August; but
before leaving Sydney he promises to get a sensa-
tional speech off his chest to the electors of Philip
division.
Vic. M.L.C. Nick Fitzgerald the other day
proudly proclaimed himself the only Roman Catho-
lic who has sat in the Legislative Council these 20
years. _ Apparently, Nick has forgotten his own
father-in-law, John O’Shanassy, also the genial
Pat Hanna.

Smith to him : “ I suppose you still enjoy a pull ? ”
''rickett: “ No, sir ; I’m saved now. Are you ? ”
Haskett: “ Well—er—l hope so.”
The Vic. Leg. Councillors on Gov.
Frassey’s speech were brilliant, as usual. C. J.
Ham, for instance, said that “ The hope expressed
in the speech that Queensland and Western Aus-
tralia would this year pass Federal Enabling
Bills was a consummation devoutly to be wished. ”
Convict Butler’s condemnation as weak-
minded of all persons with hair parted in the
middle, tends to confirm conjectures of the im-
becility of a certain Judge, whose hair has a six-
inch median parting. It also drops heavily on
H. B. Higgins, M.L.A., with his eight-inch part-
ing.
J. Stonham, assistant-teacher at Croydon
Park (N.S.W.) public school, standing for M.A.
degree at Sydney University a few weeks ago,
took as one of his themes the unusual subject of
ancient French, and passed triumphantly in it.
He is the first in N.S. Wales to achieve that dis-
tinction.
Looking for a house to rent around Melb.,
one notices the name “Davies, land and estate
agent,” in every window and on every allotment,
and it’s a different Davies every time. There are
in Melbourne of that name three financial agents,
four general ditto, 17 land and estate ditto—and
10 solicitors.
Lex. : What is the matter with Salomons,
Q. 0., that he should not be talked of as a possible
Australian representative on the Privy Council ?
Australia possesses no acuter intellect; and,
having held the N.S.W. Chief Justiceship, he is
technically qualified for the position under the
Imperial Act.
Prophecy is always risky. In March, ’BB
The Bulletin predicted that the late John
Ballance, of Maoriland, would be forgotten as a
politician, and remembered as the man who bred
the racer Fishhook. And now Ballance is poli-
tically immortal (moderately immortal, that is),
and only one man in five thousand, perhaps, re-
members he ever owned Fishhook.
A Vic. inventor (an ex-State school teacher)
some years ago devised an automatic mechanical
target, out of which local military authorities
reckoned he would clear at least a quarter of a
million. A Melb. syndicate sent him with his
invention to the land of J. Bull, and after five
years negotiating he has utterly failed, his chief
asset being his now unappreciated and valueless
idea. Five years ago he refused <£25,000 cash for
the thing.
Sir George
Stephen, one of
the family which
Brougham termed
“a parasitical
growth on the
legal system of
England,” was,
when in Mel-
bourne, a
staunch church-
man and taught
a class in Sun-
d a y-s c h o o 1.
One Sunday
something in
the collect for
the day sug-
gested a re-
miniscence of
the old Anti-
Slavery Agi-
tation, and i
the dodder- j
ing old gen- [
tleman began
a rambling 1
narrative of 1
what he had '
heard and said
and done in
the stormy
time. Recount-
ing some of the
cruelties of the
slave-owners in Jam-
aica, he, forgetting for
the moment his audi-
ence of more or less
smart boys, told a yarn
of a planter who had
—to put it mildly—
marital relations with
every woman - slave,
young and old (and he had some
scores), on his property ; “ and
he used to sell his children,”
declared the old man indig-
nantly, “ and when he was
asked why he did such a thing
he said it was because he could
get a higher price for them, as
he could give a pedigree.”
When the proprietor of
the recently-deceased Evening
(Melb.) News was paying the
comps, their final wages, one of
them said : “ The Standard
was killed by extravagance, and you, Mr. Levi,
have killed the News by meanness.” Fact.
Astley Cooper, Bart—no relation of the
Coopers, of Sydney, by the way—has taken the
Cooper mansion at Point Piper for six months.
Residence by a real English baronet will no doubt
exorcise any plebeian association that may hang
round the edifice, and there is no telling what may
happen at the expiry of the baronet’s tenancy.
The place may even be bought as a residence for
the Governor !
The smoking parsons of Burwood and
Sydney must go the way of the lamentably-athletic
Hopper Joplin. The Rey. Hopper put his ankle
out in N. Queensland, twisted his wrist in Ballarat,
and hurt his nose in various parts of Australia,
endeavoring to be hail-fellow-well-met, for religious
ends, with the athlete worldlings about him. But
he cried at last “Vanity,” and bolted “home.”
To be anything to attain a different thing is to
play a part, and the religious play-actor must
always go.
Chevalier Antoine de Kontski, just now
giving a series of pianoforte recitals at Melb.
Bijou, may be accepted as the most remarkable
musical identity on earth. At the old age of 80
he travels on his merits as a soulful executant, not
less than on his ability to play from memory all
the finest works of the famous composers, who
knew him personally in the long, long ago. He is
himself a composer of 300 sonatas, symphonies,
oratorios, masses and operas. Had he died in
1829 he would have received the obituary notice
due to an infant prodigy—and he still lives. In
childhood, De Kontski was the petted pupil of
Beethoven ; in youth, he played marbles and duets
with Chopin ; and, since he arrived at man’s estate,
he has given more performances in public, and
kissed a greater number of royal hands, than any
other classical musician that ever was. M. de
Kontski, who is now Court Pianist to Kaiser Wil-
liam, dates his style of Chevalier from 1850, when
the King of Prussia gave him his decoration, along
with the Art and Science medal which he wears
upon his iron chest to-day.
Explorer Kennedy, the remains of whose
vehicle a Cardwell (Q.) man says he has found up
Townsville way, was of a more religious turn of
mind than modern explorers seem to be. In his
intercourse with the blacks his chief agencies of
influence were religion and rations, but mostly re-
ligion. The news of his death —the aborigines
killed him—provoked sermons in several of the
Sydney churches of the day, and St. James’s
Church even commemorates his virtues on a
tablet.
The big picture of Vic. Leg. Assembly
painted by Gordon Coutts must be a great disap-
pointment to Mr. Pursey Chirnside. That
elaborate young person is painted with his back
turned to the spectator and with his head screwed
round to show his face; but the artist gives no
glimpse of Pursey’s most prominent and precious
characteristics—his necktie and his colored waist-
coat. The artist who takes away from Pursey the
colored waistcoat takes that which not enriches
him and makes Pursey poor indeed.
That new importation from England, the
Rev. W. I. Carr Smith, of St. James’s, Sydney,
has devised a novel way of making the Church
“gee.” He has introduced smoke-concerts with
cards thrown in, being of opinion that the male
members require some “innocent diversion.” To
see the parson with his abnormally long “church-
warden ” with a back-ground of jet-black beard as
big as a patriarch’s one would fancy oneself in the
presence of a Mussulman at home with his hookah.
Mr. Smith’s mission is “to minimise as much as
possible the inordinate use of violent expletives so
characteristic of colonial society. ”
“BILL" AGAIN.
THE SHEPERD : “ My flood man, do you know you are on the
road to Hell? ”
BILL SMITH : “No blanky fear! I’m on the road to the Just-in-
Time.”
THE SHEPERD : “My friend , will you take a tract? ’twill make
your path easier.”
BILL SMITH : “ Track be d — d. No more blanky short cuts for me.
I’m on the road and I’m going to stick to it all the
darned way !”
Had Gordon Coutts been a more careful
Bulletin reader he would have avoided at least
one mistake in his painting of Yic. Leg. Assem-
bly. He represents Premier Turner as delivering
an important speech—evidently a Budget—to a
full House in a smart, new, well-fitting, lavender-
colored suit. Turner simply couldn’t do such a
thing. A lavender suit may have been necessary
to the scheme of color, but as a matter of historical
veracity, the clothes ought to have been brown
old, and sacky. The Premier of the picture is a
tailor-made man, and Turner is certainly not that.
Anarchist Andrews, of Melbourne, who
appeals for funds through the Champion, is a
queer-looking personage. He takes no pride in
His attire, his usual garb consisting of a much-worn
suit far too tight and short; this, added to his
thin and straggling beard and his erratic manner
of speaking, brings him more ridicule tHan he de-
serves—for he is distinctly a man of rare and keen
intellect and of blameless honesty. The average
city man remembers when Andrews was one of
the best-dressed civil-servants in Victoria. Hap-
pening to differ from his chief (Cc-l. Templeton),
he called him a liar—which procured his dismissal
from the service.
Marcus Clarke’s retirement from the sub-
librarianship of Melb. Public Library was hastened
by his many wordy wars with the magnificent Mr.
Justice Barry, great Mogul of the establishment—
which, indeed, owes the Judge’s memory a heavy
debt of gratitude. Coming through the turnstiles
they met one day, the old man dressed impres-
sively in the heavy English fashion of sixty years
ago ; Clarke in the frailest of frail garments—his
pyjama suit. The old man stopped short. “ That
costume is unseemly,” said he. “The liberty of
the subject must be protected, sir, to dress as he
pleases, ” returned Clarke, as he slipped past.
Hon. J. G. WARD.

Mrs. Johnston, relict of the late Com-
mander Johnston, R.N., died at Sydney last
week, aged 85. She was a native of England, and
came to N.S.W. in 1826 with her father, who
emigrated for the sake of the health of his two
sons. She was married in 1831 or ’32 to Lieut.
Johnston, a son of the Colonel who deposed Bligh.
Mrs. Johnston was, with a sister of* the late Sir
William Macleay, one of the last ladies in the
province to receive a grant of land upon her mar-
riage. Owing to the death of his father and elder
brother, Lieut. Johnston retired from the navy to
manage the family properties. Mrs. Johnston
never left N.S.W., and up to the departure of
Gov. and Lady Denison, she was a leader of
society. After this time she retired wholly into
private life.
A Parkes story told by Lord Jersey.
About the first public appearance the ex-Gov.
made was at the unveiling of the statue of Dr.
Lang, in Wynyard-square, Sydney. On that
occasion, Parkes made a speech—the first after his
severe cab-accident. It was a hot day, and Mayor
Burdekin, chairman of the gathering, considerately
offered the Premier a small glass of water. The
veteran ceased speaking, and motioned as though
he was going to drink it, but he only put it near
his lips, handed it back with “Hi don’t want
hany,” and resumed his address. Lord Jersey
happened to mention the incident to the old man
some time afterwards, when Parkes, with a broad
smile, said that, as it was such a small glass, he
thought it might be gin and water, but when he
got it near his nose he knew there was no gin
there.
Herewith appears the photo, of ex-Treas.
J. G. Ward, of Maoriland, whose luckless Farmers’
Association has necessitated his withdrawal, in a
badly-wrecked state, from politics. Ward started
earning his living as a message-boy in the tele-
graph-service in Southern M.L. He learnt in
spare moments to do the “ tick ” business, and got
a place at the operating board. After a while ho
deemed himself entitled to promotion and asked
therefor, but was refused on account of his youth.
He said a few hair-raising words to the boss, and
left the service ; to return to it 20 years later as
Postmaster-General, Commissioner of Telegraphs,
and the ruler of the man who refused him his
rise ! Ward has been roundly abused by the Tory
press both in Australia and at ’Ome, but he
has been probably the ablest, Treasurer M.L.
has known. His fall is another proof that
“Ye cannot serve State and Mammon.”
Maoriland Parliament has supplied several other
examples to the same effect. Stout’s legal and
trust business in Dunedin went absolutely to pot
when he was a Minister, and it took years after
his political downfall to build it up again. Now
that he is once more into the turmoil of public
life, he has no less than three partners to look after
his business in his absence. Ballance had to give
up his journalistic life in Wanganui, though he
dearly loved it, when he took the Premiership.
Pat Buckley had two partners—but office to
him was always made a holiday affair. On the
other hand, Premier Seddon has no business con-
nections to interfere with politics ; Lands Minister
M'Kenzie is an independent farmer, and his
family looks after his place down South ; Railways
Cadman is pretty free ; Public Works Hall-Jones
is absolutely untied; so also are Carroll, Thomp-
son, and Montgomery, W. P. Reeves, and Hori
Grey ; likewise Russell, Rolleston, and most of
the Tory leaders. As a business spec., politics
spell 9d. in the £.

The latest “ corner ” wheeze. Two well-known touring
N.S.W. actor-managers proceeding home through Hyde
Park, the other night, were bailed up and robbed—one of
a diamond ring, the other of £47 in cash. As it is told :
“Fortunately the thieves did not discover the firms
cheque-book!” That the story is pure invention doesn t
detract from its humor.
The Mecca of “ Jimmy” M‘Mahon’s London pilgrimage
is said to be the Cimeotograph.
The “ furniture and effects ” of a notorious Sydney
house were auctioned one day last week. Various “ lots
consisted of autographed portraits of well-known actors,
but bidding for the mummers was far from brisk—from
6d. to a few “ bob.” Patrons of the sale, however, found
plenty of amusement in comparing notes.
Pro. : Why does the private-life joke of the male mum-
mer always concern the way he dodged his board-bill ?
This is a conundrum that has always vexed me. Is the
actor more dishonest than any other man, and does he
pride himself on the fact ? Surely not.
Mao-gie Moore declares that she has one important
qualification for playing Trilby : she wears twos in shoes.
“ To this complexion.” Last Era says that Terriss, in the
forthcoming Adelphi production, will wear a costume dis-
playing the “beauties of his form” better than in any
previous drama. Male ballet next.
Beerbohm Tree, writes The Bulletin’s London corre-
spondent, will shortly begin building his new London
theatre on the site of the old Haymarket Opera House.
“ Trilby ” has proved a veritable gold-mine to him and his
backers. The takings even now approach £lOOO a week,
and the profits have only been equalled by those of
“Charley’s Aunt.”
In Gilbert and Sullivan’s new opera, “ The Grand Duke,”
one of the characters, a theatrical manager, tells the
audience that if a man can rule a theatrical company he
can rule anything .
“ Both A and B rehearsal slight;
They say they’ll be ‘ all right at night ’
(They’ve both to go to school yet).
O in each act must change her dress;
D will attempt to ‘ square the press ’;
E won’t play Romeo unless
His grandmother plays Juliet;
F claims all hoydens as her rights
(She’s played them thirty seasons);
And G must show herself in tights
For two convincing' reasons—
Two very well-shaped reasons !
Oh, the man who can drive a theatrical team,
With wheelers and leaders in order supreme,
Can govern and rule, with a wave of his fin,
All Europe—with Ireland thrown in 1 ”
Victoria has several promising young baritones who
may have a future before them, but none of the “ rising”
tenors heard of late seem likely to rise much. The tenor
voice is more scarce everywhere than it used to be, and
this meat-eating country is not specially favorable to its
cultivation, one supposes.
Not equal to Walker’s—the Laird’s “ Scotch.”
A question which is exercising- the habitues of certain
musical warehouses just now has, through the pertinacity
of a certain misanthropic individual, attained consider-
able prominence. The aforesaid misanthrope declares
that Sunny Australia has produced no prominent vocal
male artistes. It is asserted that Newbury and Cunning-
ham are the possessors of good voices—especially the
former —but that, in the opinion of competent musicians,
these gentlemen are not genuine artistes. It is urged
that female vocalists such as Melba, Saville, Crossley, and
Sherwin are artistes, and it is added that Australia is as
far off as ever in evolving a son of the soil who could be
hall-marked “ Artist.” The reason assigned is that this
continent breeds meat-eating creatures whose daily food
quickly exterminates the “ soul-germ ” implanted occa-
sionally by Nature. It is said that Continental centres,
with less meat-eating propensities and opportunities,
have succeeded in giving to the world great singers, and
Italy is instanced as a locale where, with little meat but a
more pronounced vegetarian diet, “ soul ” microbes are
successfully cultivated. It is argued, as regards the
female portion of Australia, that the feminine vanity of
preserving the complexion is responsible for comparative
abstemiousness, combined with medical injunctions which
enjoin little meat-eating in young girls.
The easiest method of building up a theatrical fund has
been repeatedly suggested by the press. A tax of Id. in
the £ upon all salaries exceeding 15s. per week could be
levied by show-managers without any trouble at all, and
a fortnightly or monthly payment of this tax, by post or
otherwise, to the treasurer of the fund would be easy
to arrange. Nor would it be a difficult thing to enforce.
The objection that small managers are frequently dead-
broke doesn’t apply, because the broker pays no salaries,
and is consequently under no obligation to forward tax
moneys. Also, the objection that individual salaries
would be disclosed by this system is all gammon and
spinach. The managerial tax-paper would not need to
furnish any particulars.
Of the late Arthur Cecil, says London Referee, it may
be written that he had a good heart, an abundant talent,
and an enormous appetite.
A bankrupt pro., a managerial actor, told the Sydney
Insolvency Registrar, the other day, that “he took a com-
ny to the Northern rivers, and the trip cost him all he
. . . . The receipts amounted to £3Ol, and the
disbursements to £303.” Ergo :£2 was “ all he had.”
Charles Morton, of the Palace Theatre, is the first
London manager to legislate against the big-hat nuisance.
He published a request that ladies attending his show
would either refrain from head-gear of the “ objection-
able ” class, or put it under the seat during the perform-
ance.
Penley says that, while rehearsing the play, he travelled
over London as Charley’s Aunt, cheeking ’bus-con-
ductors.
Shifter: “ The Lethbridge-Weir incident, at Melb.
Princess’s, deserves expansion. Mary Weir rehearsed
the Serpentine for the ‘ Forty Thieves,’ and every-
one could see it must be a hit. Alice Lethbridge
interfered, and Williamson said it shouldn’t be done.
Nevertheless, at night, Mary rushed on and did it, and
J.C.W. pretended to be angry. Of course, when the lithe
and wiry one was gone, the substantial cut-and-come-
again woman had her show.”
Wedding- card from ’Frisco “ Albert G. Winterhalter*
lieutenant, United States Navy, and Helen Gibson
Dauvray, married Wednesday, 29th April, 1896, Alameda,
California.” Miss Dauvray, it will be remembered, played
at Sydney Lyceum last year in “ Old Kentucky,” and
appeared in Sydney with Geo. Giddens under the name of
“ Little Nell ” in 1884.
The other Sunday evening some seven or eight hundred
people (well-dressed, mostly) crushed into St. Mark’s
church, Fitzroy, Melb., the draw being Philip Newbury,
who was advertised to sing. Sad to say, the offertory
panned out only £4, mostly in battered 3d. bits.
Victorian : “ I never saw an amateuress in full tights
till an operatic performance this week.”
Melb. : “ The Hebraics have gone clean off their chumps
over a whole week’s amateur performances on end. Just
think of all this year wasted by a heap of young women
and men (about 70 being concerned), each with a desper-
ate ambition, a consuming lust, for the dust and ashes,
the Dead Sea apples of the stage, so lusciously painted in
gloss and bloom. *lf I can’t be a Juliet, I’ll be a Juliet
Wray.’”
H. : “ As a tonic to Bellew’s powerful libel on Marat,
the Carlyle horse-leech fancy, read what he really was in
last Encyclopedia Britannica : 1 A courtly kind of
physician, a doctor for ladies and gentlemen, practising
a while in Edinburgh, then becoming attached to the
semi-regal household of the Count d’Artois.’ In short, he
began as an aristocrat, with a passionate affection for the
poor and oppressed, and was turned into a wild beast by
the persecution that drove him to live in the sewers.”
Chevalier Kontski, the Rip-Van-Winklish piano-puncher,
now in Melb., is a man whose soul is in heaven with his
old cronies Palestrina, Bach, Handel, Mozart, and
Beethoven, while his body keeps marching on
here below. He only calls himself a trifle over 80,
knowing the Australian penchant for youth, with its de-
termination of seeing Irving and Patti in the twentieth
century. Nobody can date him, any more than nut-
cracker Sam. Thompson, who has been on Flemington
training-ground, turnip in hand, every dawn since the
year one.
Gov. and Lady Brassey (and suite) appear to take a
personal interest in Miss Maggie Stirling. The mellow
warbling of that amiable, hardworking artist is certain of
an encore at any Melbourne concert where Guv’ment
’Ouse is present to lend several pairs of hands.
Hilda Spong, accompanied by her mother, has left for
London.
A dramatic author bemoaning (in the Cornhill Maga-
zine) the failure of the average “ leading man ” to grasp
the playwright’s idea, says : “In that common case, all
you can do is to let him go his own road. Don’t insist on
his coming yours, for then you will get no result what-
ever —no approximation even to anything human. You
will not be able to force him into your characterisation,
and you will have destroyed such individuality as he may
possess of his own. Many a play has been ruined by an
author insisting on the certain, definite reading of a part
which the actor couldn’t give because it didn’t suit his
personality, and he was too little of an artist to change
or adopt it.” Moral, pick your co. whilst writing your
play, if the manager be agreeable. Generally speaking,
the manager—for excellent business reasons—would see
you darned first. In which common case each important
character must be made sufficiently flexible to fit many
actors. The most lucrative plays are those that admit of
successful playing by any competent band of mummers,
at ’Ome or abroad.
Harwood recalls a time when, working in a saw-pit, he
saw a party of actors and actresses passing through the
bush, and sighed at their merry life, but never thought
he would have the luck to get into the category.
Criticism under the advertising thumb. How often is
the understudy mentioned in any newspaper ?
“ Bohemia,” a play founded on Murger’s “ La Vie de
Boh6me,” has succeeded “ Trilby ” as the latest’Murkan
craze. It is said that Du Maurier got most of his ideas
from Murger’s book.
Cockaigne : “ These theatrical divorces are sickening-
mere ads. I remember Marius coming resplendently into
the court with a flower in his button-hole.”
Eleonora Duse could not avoid the reporters in Copen-
hagen. One, disguised as a waiter, attended on her at
table. Another was the cabby who drove her to her
hotel. A third got on as a stage-hand. A fourth
measured her for a shoe.
The N.S.W. Government Statist estimates
that the population of Sydney diminished by
15,000 last year.
Ganger (loq.) : “Now, my lads, fIU the
back of your shovels, the front’ll fill itself. A
companion to “ Maker’s name ! Up to maker s
name!” or late John Robb’s “Big shovels and
quick! ”
Dear Bulletin,— The Unitarian Church,
Eastern Hill (Melb.) is not a mere shell, and
Gyles Turner is not its only supporter and attend-
ant. The church, thanks to the Rev. A. Hender-
son, is in a more prosperous state than it has been
for many a long day. I could give you the names
of a dozen good men who, with their families, are
constant attendants and good at giving. A fact
not generally known is that many Spiritualists
have, since the collapse of the Sunday evening
gatherings in the Lyceum, gone over to the Uni-
tarian Church—acknowledged on all sides to be
one of the prettiest and most comfortable edifices
in Melbourne. The Unity . Club, which meets
fortnightly, boasts an average attendance of 150.
—M.
The usual girl with a tale of woe to tell
about a dreadful man has been on the loose at
Albury (N.S.W.). In the first place this bright
young child of nature alleged that she had been
“assaulted.” A shearer was arrested on the
charge, and being shown to her at the local gaol,
she promptly and emphatically declared that he
was not the wanted man. She afterwards con-
firmed the statement on oath and he was released.
Then a few hours later she declared that he was
the man, and that she had recognised him at first
sight, but had lied from some wholly unaccount-
able motive. Thereupon the shearer was re-
arrested, and after that the girl swore to him
steadily. Finally, after two months’ gaol, his
trial came and he proved an alibi and was acquit-
ted, and the girl was left still swearing. The
police are now looking for some other man to
convict on her oath, and as she is probably im-
proving in the art of identification, the present
writer wouldn’t take his chance as the next suspect
for a good-sized gold-mine.
“Dobson, Way, and Windeyer,” remarks
an Adelaide lawyer to The Bulletin, “ are
bracketed as eligible candidates for the proposed
Australian vacancy on the law bench of the Privy
Council, but on no sufficiently clear grounds.
Several other Judges fall within the sphere of
eligibility described by the Colonial Office. What,
for instance, except political conviction, stands
against the name of Charles Lilley ? He is inde-
pendent of ‘ salary ’; he was on the bench of Q.
Supreme Court when Windeyer was playing
minor politics, and his conduct on the Bench was
certainly as irreproachable as that of his much-
canvassed compeers. The unceremonious exclu-
sion of Lilley as a possible candidate for
the office raises the question: ‘ Would not
Higinbotham have been shut out on similar
grounds? 5 If this be so, then can an office,
the door of which is slammed in the faces
of Judges like Lilley and Higinbotham, and
which appears to stand invitingly open for persons
like Windeyer and Way, be seriously discussed I v
Australians at large ? ”

A newly-married, laborer out of employ-
nent cut his throat in Melb. the other day. His
bride, who had elected to sleep in the parlor, leav-
ing' him a monopoly of the nuptial cxmch, was
awakened by the milkman’s knock. He didn t
arise and collect the milk, as a loving husband
should, so the lady went to enquire into the pause :
of his backwardness, and lo ! she was a widow. I
She had been a widow once before. *

A correspondent writes :
At Whittlesea (Vic.) the village settlers have to go
round ten miles from the railway-station to reach their
land, whereas if thev were allowed right-of-way through
an adjacent squatter’s land the distance would be only a
little over a mile. When the settlers have exhausted the
Govt, grant (t'4o each) they leave the land partly cleared
and fenced, and the squatter thereafter finds it handy to
run his cattle over. No village settlement can prosper
under the conditions which exist at Whittlesea, ,\et it it
doesn't prosper despite these hopeless drawbacks it will
be held as a proof of the impossibility of village settle
meht in general. The Government seems to be always
working into Fatma-n’s hands.

Bone-grafting extraordinary. A London
doctor, the other day, had occasion to scoop out
all the interior of the heehbone (os calcis) of a
patient, owing to tuberculosis, leaving only a thin
shell. Now, a foot without a heel-bone is like
Hamlet without the Prince. So the resourceful
doctor took the collar-bone of a lamb (part of a
shoulder served as dinner to the doctors ot the
hospital), decalcified it in hydrochloric acid,
ground it into a paste, and filled the yawning
cavity in the bone therewith. In a fortnight the
healing was complete, and the patient has a new
heel quite equal to the natural human article.
This is the eighth time the same doctor has suc-
cessfully used this bone-packing process.

THE AUSTRALIAN GEM TRADE.
H. Newman, the well-known jeweller of 175
Elizabeth-street, Melbourne, is the largest buyer
of opal in Australia, and opal miners will find it
to their advantage to send their opal direct to
him. The firm has a reputation for straight deal-
ing extending over a period of 40 years, which is
a sufficient guarantee to consignors that they will
be honorably treated. H. Newman is also a
buyer of all other Australian gems.*
The death of Professor Loisette, which
was recently reported in some of the American
papers, will not affect the business carried on by
the branch established in Sydney for the Aus-
tralasian provinces for imparting his memory-
culture system. When the Professor was lecturing
here last year he made full provision for
all contingencies, placing in charge of his branch
specially qualified assistants, who, as he certified,
are as capable of imparting his system as he was
himself. The system is such that it will live after
him. The fact that it has been successfully taught
in all parts of the civilised world for a quarter of
a century is a guarantee of its efficacy.*
The New Mutual Insurance.
We now have life insurance, accident insurance;
insurance against fire, theft, and damage. You
can insure your life, your property ; and you can
insure against damage by fire, water or the ele-
ments. But, still more practical and important
than all these, is that you can now insure against
ailments and ills which are prevalent around you.
You can insure against headaches, against pain
after meals, against all symptoms of liver disease;
you can also insure against pain in back, oppres-
sive or difficult breathing, lassitude, nausea, and
loss of flesh —in fact, all the symptoms following
kidney weakness—by a prompt recourse to War-
ner’s Safe Cure. Do not wait until you are so
queer and bad that you will be refused a policy of
life insurance, but whenever the symptoms of the
liver or kidney ailment appear, go to your nearest
medicine vendor, procure a bottle of this medicine,
and try it. Unless your kidneys and liver are
differently made to others, it will have the same
prompt curative effect it has had in thousands of
cases which have been cured by the use of Warner’s
Safe Cure. Surely you do not need a philosopher
to explain a clear, practical point of this kind.
Every day common sense will allow vou to reason
it out carefully for yourself, and if guided by such
a reasoning, you will be as satisfied with the result
as was Mr. Thos. Nash, furrier, Geelong, who
says: “ During a severe attack of liver disease,
accompanied by yellow jaundice, and after follow-
ing medical advice without receiving any benefit,
I was recommended to take Warner’s Safe Cure.
I am happy to say that two bottles completely
cured me, and have had no trouble of the kind
since.”*

A cageful of men had an exciting experi-
ence in the New Victoria United, Ballarat, the
other day. Something had gone wrong, and the
pumps had not been throwing the usual volume,
so that there were seven or eight feet of water in
the shaft “unbeknownst.” Into this cage and
men were lowered, and they might have drowned
had not one cool customer fought his way through
the top, and then hauled his companions up after
him. The last man was half-way to heaven when
the doctors got to work on him.
Among the sheaves of English obituaries
on Parkes the Saturday Review’s brief notice
stands out as about the truest:—
Undoubtedly a man of considerable talents, he rose to
place and power by his gift of vigorous, rugged, and pic-
turesquely ungrammatical oratory ; for a time he was so
idolised by a section of the Antipodean public that he
took himself quite seriously as a heaven-sent statesman.
He regarded Australia as a Greater Britain, and himself
as the greatest of Australians. A colossal egotist, he
believed that what he could not do could be done by no
one else in Australia. The fact that Australia has not
come nearer to Federation than she is now is due in a
large measure to his unbounded jealousy of other men’s
efforts. His inability to pay his debts seems to have con-
vinced his admirers that he was an Australian Pitt.
There is but one error—Parkes was not ungram-
matical.
There was little ceremony about the dis-
missals from N.S.W. Civil Service. For instance,
Mr. Archibald Fraser, Under-secretary for Justice,
after 42 years able and honorable service, obtained
the first intimation of his dismissal from the
Gazette, which said that he would retire from
the service at the end of the month. A day
or two later Minister Gag Gould looked in and
curtly told him that the new Under-secretary was
coming to-morrow, and that he needn’t attend the
office after then —he would be paid up to the end
of the month. And this after 42 years service !
The Bulletin sincerely deplores the exit of Mr.
Fraser from N.S.W. Civil Service —more especially
as he has been succeeded by an official whose mind,
as far as it has been sampled, evidently revolves in
the same circle as the alleged intellect of a poli-
tician who now, by a strange irony, presides over
the N.S.W. Justice department. For Mr. Fraser
was a man conspicuously fitted alike by his in-
stincts and his experience to act as an intermediary
between convicted men and the Minister who
could dispense or withhold mercy. It is under-
stood that Mr. Fraser intends to enter upon the
practice of his profession as a solicitor in Sydney.
The inquiry into the alleged very bad
mismanagement of the electrical and engineering
branches of the Vic. postal department ran up
against the same snag which so constantly met
the Lormer inquiry at its early stages. Hamilton,
M.L.A., propounded a series of ugly charges
against the management. A board was appointed
to investigate, and the Government put up bar-
rister Maxwell to conduct the case for the prose-
cution, and barrister Mackay to act for the defence.
Mackay apparently received his brief in good time,
and, when the inquiry commenced, he was ready
to show there and then that the department was
as pure as snow and as brainy as Solomon. But
the Government only briefed Maxwell the night
before the opening of the inquiry, and he had to
apply for a week’s adjournment while he read up
the case.
SPORTING NOTIONS.
An Australian abroad to The Bulletin by last
mail: —“ Every person in England who has been in Aus-
tralia, no matter for how short a time, writes to Manager
Musgrove for a season-ticket to admit to all matches, and
on previous occasions has had them. Musgrove, however,
objects to this wholesale free-pass system, and there is
much complaining.
“ Clem Hill’s faultless 73 against Essex, the
second match of the tour, deserves much praise. The
Australian wickets were going down like ninepins, and he
stopped a rot which might have meant defeat, and thus
affected the whole tour.
“The Australian cricketers travel round Eng-
land in two first-class carriages. The Midland Railway
Co. has contracted for the whole tour.
“ The wealth-line is strongly drawn on English
cricket-grounds. The general admission to see a match
against the Australians is Is., the grand stands are ss.
and 10s. 6d.
“Manager Musgrove was the only notable in
frock coat and top hat at the Sheffield Park match. Eight
suits and straw hats were the rule, but a number, includ-
ing “ Tummy,” wore the ordinary “ bowler.”
“ The Australians were determined not to lose
their first match, and played for a draw failing a win.
This made the game very slow, for everything high to the
off was allowed to pass, and, the ground being hard, ball
after ball was never struck at.
“ The Australians can go into any theatre in
England on presenting their cards. They used to take
their friends in with them, but Musgrove shut down on
this in his own sweet way.
“ George Bull (late of Sydney) travels with the
cricketers on behalf of the London Daily Mail, the
Harmsworths’ new venture. He has not married and
says he never intended to marry Madge Rossell-—who
dances as happily as ever in ‘ The Shop Girl ’ at the Gaiety.
“Thecricketers, when playing at Sheffield Park,
have the pick of the best rooms in the Hotel Metropole,
the finest hotel in Brighton. They dine privately on the
choicest of viands and drink only the best brands of fizz.
And the noble Earl stands the whole racket. It is said
that on this occasion his Lordship felt hurt that the wine-
bill was so small.
“ Last season Little Johnny Briggs took a team
up to Liverpool to play a match against 18 of Liverpool
and district. Among his eleven was Crossland, the Lan-
cashire quick bowler, who was disqualified for the county
for throwing. Bowling one of his swiftest it hit the
opposing batsman a severe blow on the leg, and the man
walked away from the wicket as Crossland appealed un-
successfully for leg-before. ‘ Not out! Not out! ’ they
shouted after the retreating man. But he turned round
and remarked, ‘ Noa —but Om domned well going.’
“ Gregory’s 154 against the XI. of England at
the Crystal Palace was a fine exhibition of all-round
batting ; and for the first time since he came to England
he showed his true form.
“ The London press are not in love with Eady’s
stj'le, remarking that he has not shown himself a bats-
man, neither does he shape like one. It is funny to see
little Gregory put one to the boundary without apparent
effort, while the Tasmanian giant stands up, opens his
shoulders, and cannot get the ball half the distance.
“ Giffen’s 7 for 15 in the match against De
Trafford’s English XI. was a triumph for the South Aus-
tralian, and he made the most of it. When the innings
was all over he stood near the wickets deep in conversa-
tion until every other player was in the pavilion. He
then made his entry alone amid the cheers of the crowd
which had assembled to see him pass. It was a well-con-
sidered theatrical effect.
“ Jones’s performance in the first innings against
the English XI., at the Crystal Palace, should not be lost
sight of in the light of Giffen’s more sensational effort in
their second innings. Eight wickets for 39 runs is not an
everyday average.”
‘ Trumble,” writes another Bulletin corres-
pondent from England, “proved the folly of his exclusion
from the Sheffield Park match by taking 10 Essex wickets
for 108 runs. M'Kibbin’s solitary scalp has cost 105 runs,
and up to now he and Eady are the failures of the team.
The Tasmanian fields like an over-grown, loose-boned colt
with a draught-horse’s shoes on, and bats in the style of a
Yarrabakbloks ‘Yob.’ His hands are feet, and his feet
over-loaded mud-barges. It may be ‘ big-man’s ’ nervous-
ness, but it is none the less disastrous and distressing.
/‘A wet or fiery wicket is necessary to supply
sting to the bowling of Kortright, who gathers up steam
in a 70-feet preliminary run. Mead—a clever bowler of
the Peel type—should be the more successful bowler.
“ Hill has batted like a wary seasoned veteran
in the three matches played—32, 23, 73, and 41, are his
steadily-earned scores. The Adelaide boy can hit two
‘ fourers ’ in succession, and then play the remainder of
the over as if he were batting for a ‘ not out,’ and that is
the secret of century-scoring. An old, steady head on
young, lively shoulders.
“ De Trafford’s team ‘ turned it up ’ as soon as
their slogging captain went for 2 (a ‘ blob’ in the second)
and never made an attempt to stiffen it down again.
Giffen, who had been having bad luck, clean bowled five
of them, and got 7 for 15. It looked as simple as smash-
ing eggs with an axe. The English papers have since dis-
covered the England XI. was ‘no class.’ They are also
questioning Jones’s delivery, and complaining that
Gregory hits too hard, and Hill inconsiderately puts the
ball to ‘ leg ’ when all the fieldsmen are on the ‘ off.’
“ At Crystal Palace a successful member of the
team gave a striking illustration of the answer to a vulgar
old conundrum (‘ What is it the poor man throws away
and the rich man puts in his pocket ?’) He showed the
poor man’s independence and made his fellow-country-
men’s stomachs squirm. King Kruger thus acts adroitly,
and he stiffened Chamberlain ; then why not King
who stiffened Grace ?
“The opportunities afforded A. Trott and
Harry (both employed by the M.C.C.) to show their
calibre have not disclosed any special performance. The
latter v. Leicester scored 8 and 26 (thrown out), and
Albert has secured 4 wickets in each of several innings for
about 25 runs per wicket.
“ Trotty (’Joe’) was not at ease until Thoms
and West ‘ passed ’ Jones’s delivery at Sheffield Park. The
delivery of nearly all the fast bowlers here is doubtful,
more or less.
* * * *
All the Australian cricketers are “Mistered”
by London Times. In the Sheffield Park match all the
Englishmen, save Jackson and Fry, were excepted from
the honor—even Prince Ran., &c., having to be satisfied
with mere initials.
Mofussil : “ Ranjitsinghi, the cricketer, is a
pupil of Chester Macnaghten, a remarkable man, who
died in India a few weeks ago. In 1870 Gov. Lord Mayo
appointed him chief of the Kathiawar College, where he
remained ever since. This has exercised incalculable in-
fluence in the education of native aristocrats. Macnaghten
was a veritable nurse of rulers, for a hundred of the most
influential rajahs of India at present were moulded by
him.”
» * * *
All England, in their second innings at Lord’s,
scored 111 for the loss of four men, on a “ heavy ” wicket,
between showers. If the Australians had scored their
first innings of 53 under the same conditions, their press
barrackers would have assumed that the wicket was “ab-
solutely unplayable.”
That same innings of 53 in the test-match ought
to be accepted as “a smack in the eye” by every rabid
patriot who cried “ Unplayable wicket! ” when the M.C.C.
got rid of Our Boys for a paltry 18. Nobody save the
patriots could understand how the wicket came to be so
particularly bad during one particular hour of the day
when the Australians were batting on it. The M.C.C.
went in first and made a decent score. Then the Austra-
lians got out for 18, after which they followed on and
“ found the wicket improving”—inasmuch as they didn’t
all go down like ninepins this time.
Excessive caution, aggravated by nervousness,
was what the Australians suffered from in the first innings
of their first two matches at Lord’s. On each occasion
they saw their mistake, and played a bolder game in the
second innings, with vastly better results. In England
nowadays the slow and careful style of play doesn’t seem
to answer, unless, of course, the bowling is so much
weaker than the batting that it admits of any sort of
treatment. The county teams score rapidly, or get out
soon, and the same rule has generally applied to the Aus-
tralians in matches where they didn’t stand over their
opponents. Against a South of England eleven, for
example, they had scored 240 for three wickets at 5
o’clock in the afternoon, thanks to Giffen and Gregory,
who contributed over 100 apiece by fairly vigorous hitting.
“ Having done so well,” says the Morning Post report,
“it might reasonably have been expected they would
attempt to force the game. Strangely enough, however,
they adopted very cautious methods, and met with such
little success that in the last 45 minutes only 18 were
added and three wickets fell.” It is this confounded
caution that stops so many batsmen, at the last minute,
from getting the “coveted century.” In last week’s test-
match Abel began to “ play with great care as he neared
the hundred” and came to grief accordingly. Served
him right. The bolder game had been a good friend to
him, yet he meanly went back on it.
* * * *
When news of the Australians’ 53 in the test
match reached Kalgoorlie, the miners clubbed together
and cabled to Harry Musgrove—“For the honor of Aus-
tralia, knock off and bring them home.—Australia.”
* ¥ * *
At the Y.R.C. “Grand National” meeting,
which opens next Saturday, the Millers and the Manifolds
will, more likely than not, keep the big prizes from slip-
ping into less decent hands. Dungan is favorite for the
G.N. Hurdle Race at time of writing, and the brilliant
steeplechaser, who can’t very well come to grief at a
hurdle,' is fast enough to beat nearly all of them, even
with the steadier of list. 71b. on his back. That the
Messrs. Miller mean business is certain. Redleap was
entered more for the purpose of keeping the weights
down, than with the hope of seeing the old ’un win
again. Artist, who has been expected to prove the
stable’s champion on the day, didn’t get very kind treat-
ment from the handicapper (list. 91b.); nevertheless,
this dark horse will carry The Bulletin’s five shillings
should the owners recommend his chance, in which case
the betting-market will give punters a good straight tip.
If Artist wins his trial he ought to go out at a short price
and win the race, bar accidents.
One feature of the weights for the big Cups is
the treatment of the rising three-year-olds. Handicappers
are attaining a higher opinion of what youngsters are
capable of doing over distances as compared with pre-
vious years, and juveniles seem to be improving. Penal-
ised Waterfall’s fourth last .year, behind a three-year-old
filly, tends to very much confirm the view. All the same,
Newhaven’s 8"2 in Caulfield Cup, and 713 in Flemington,
do not look very alluring even if he is a stayer, which the
writer doubts.
* * * *
Wallace’s lOst. in Melb. Cup ought to effectually
stop him, if something else doesn’t. It is quite likely that
one of the stable three-year-olds will be the St. Alban’s
pick on the day.
*"* * *
If he can stay, Vanitas is a likely C. Cup candi-
date. He is bred that way, and is a particularly smart
sprinter.
* * * *
Now current talk that one Sydney select crowd
who have been waiting with pleasurable patience for a
big cup, got a stiff knock-out when they saw the weights.
People who desire to be thought clever, fall badly when
a handicapper sets ’em down at their own value, so to
speak.

The Ascot Gate-Money Racing Club, Melb.,
gives £2OO for a day’s racing in July, £3OO for one in
October, and £5OO for one in Nov., including the Ascot
Gold Cup, £250. Obviously the club skrimps up to rival
Caulfield. The cards are shuffling.
* * * *
If Moorefield Handicap run was The Captain’s
true form, he isn’t the best to have hanging round a
stable. Favorite, and carrying only 7.10, he finished like
a non-stayer. The Newcastle people got in on city punters
with Helmsman, at a cost to the latter of much hard cash
and many inverted commas.
* * * *
The inferior 13 saddled for Moorefield juvenile
race gave one an idea of what a young giant could do
among ’em. “ Consistency ”is a lost term, “ turn-about ”
seeming to be the thing. And when one doesn’t win
when it’s his day out, it’s simply due to bad luck.
* * * *
The expected return of Broken Hill to his Aus.
Cup form in the Spring is causing the laying of live wagers
for Melb. two miles. His late running doesn’t altogether
warrant the bookified assumption. Broken Hill —broken
still.

Strong Adelaide tips concerning local horses for
the Cups, Derby, handicaps—everything—are now in cir-

Saturday’s racing-coincidences :—At Moorefield
(N.S.W.) and Williamstown (Vic.), four double-named
horses won races ; two pulled off doubles, one race of each
double being the same, distance done in the same time ;
in each of the others exactly 11 horses ran, the favorites
in both starting at 5 to 2.
» * » »
More people attended the S.A.J.O.’s last one-
day meeting and more money went through the “tote”
than has ever been the case before. The six winning horses
were all well-backed at an average price of 10 to 1. Sig-
nificant !
**; * *
A little-thought-of tote-advantage is the fact
that should no money be on the winner of a race all
backers get back their cash minus 10 percent. Thus Man
of Honor won Mentone (Vic.) Flying Handicap, last week,
unbacked with the machine operating. The man who had
£5O on Sinking Fund, the second horse, would have got
£45 instead of leaving it in Mo’s bag.

As Rugby progresses, improving weekly play
doesn’t seem to attract the Sydney public to the extent
expected. Saturday’s semi-final crowds were only fair to
ordinary. Randwicks walked over ’Varsity by 21 to 0,
but it was an exciting match, the points giving faint idea
of the rate of notching. Only three were secured in the
first half, after which the U’s were taken off their feet,
and couldn’t last the distance. They started too well, but
the premiers showed superior combination The Rand-
wick’s can’t well lose the final—unless the opposing backs
defend their line with bull-dogs and shot-guns.
Wallaroo and Rand wick run in and out in race-
track fashion. Saturday gave Wallaroo an Bto 3 supre-
macy. It was a mostly forward struggle, the heavies in
front being made to earn their tea. Consequently, the
rear division got work as casual laborers, the “feeding”
being scanty. There isn’t much difference between the
two teams : it all depends how the game is played.
* * * *
The Vic. Eootball Ass. attempted last Saturday
to revive interest in the game it has stifled by changing
the boundary-rule and declaring the ball in play after
leaving the umpire’s hands. This doubtful improvement
failed to raise any popular enthusiasm. The Association
will probably put its only other idea into execution, and
count behinds as well as goals. Anything rather than try
cleansing the big clubs of cronkness.
Leading Vic. football clubs still maintain their
relative positions behind Essendon, which went through
the hardening process for the premiership by defeating
Williamstown, 7 goals to 3 goals, on Saturday. Colling-
wood downed unlucky Geelong, and South beat Melb.,
whoimmediately left for their Tas. trip, which should effec-
tually burst them up. Of the middle division, St. Kilda,
though unfortunate, look promising, their Footscray vic-
tory placing them above Melb. and next to Fitzroy. As
predicted, Essendon, Collingwood, and South Melb. seem
certain to fill the premiership places this season.

The existence of the Vic. game of football de-
pends upon the local schools and colleges. Whatever

Rugby promises to be shortly adopted by many. When
the schools play Rugby the other game will be a thing of
the past.

THE SINGERS’ FRIEND.
ACTUAL FACT. —We met a friend the other day
who said he had a slight cold. Upon our recom-
mending “NATARA,” he took from his pocket a small
phial of “ Natara,” and said : “ Last night I had to sing a
song. I left home without an overcoat and caught a
chill, so that I could barely struggle through the song.
When I reached home I took two doses of * Natara,’ and
here lam almost well. I have brought out of the large
bottle this small quantity to take during the day, and to-
night I will be as right as pie when I have again to sing.
I consider ‘ Natara ’ the most wonderful remedy for colds
and coughs, and I have used nothing else for years.”

Sundry casual sports used to wonder where a
certain sepulchral-looking schoolmaster got his good in-
formation. Also, the parents of a young Ikey Mo couldn’t
understand why “ friends ” gave the boy so much silver.
The double mystery has been fathomed. Young Hooknose
was the master’s favorite class-boy, and, Hebrew-like, im-
parted all the breakfast and tea-table horsey chatter for a
small consideration.

“Scotty the Wr inkier ” : —Not only in sport,
but in work, pacing is necessary to obtain records : e.g. in
post-hole sinking, trenching, lock-spitting for surveyors,
and notably in shearing. When M‘lnnes did the
Brookong tally he had a mate in the pen who took the
cobblers. I was not present at Howe’s record, but I know
that the pacing, running or racing done against Mick
Granlow at Conbogalong, on the Castlereagh, was a
matter of trying to kill him, instead of which he put up a
record, over 200, and not bad for a second year’s shearing.
He was only 18 years old, and the work was equal to a
score of mile sprints on a bike. I think one Provan has
the rabbit-skinning medal, something like 80 in half-an-
hour, though the country reeks with rabbiters who will
tell you they can beat that. To-day another record-
sinasher claims two acres ploughing in a day in April,
nine-inch furrow, five-inches deep, single furrow plough.
This makes him walk 21 miles, clean his mould board, lose
time at turns, and feed his horses, all between 7 a.m. and
5 p.m. He is a fair bishop among ploughmen, and was
probably a fisherman when he learned to estimate.

Yankee files predict extensive use of one-
wheeled sulkies during coming trotting season. The
latest pneumatic sulky has a high seat, attached by steel
rods to shafts which don’t wobble, but help the horse to
keep an even, well-balanced gait. The horse’s hoofs keep
clear of the sulky, which seems as near perfection as
possible.
• * • •
The Salvation Army has adopted the bike.
“ We claim the cycle for God,” says the English War Cry,
chiefly, it appears, because it enables many an “ officer”
to put in Saturday night with his wife and still be at
“ knee-drill ”10 miles away next morning. This explana-
tion was necessary, or it might have been thought that
the bike was approved of because it enabled many an
“officer” to slither from his wife and spend Saturday
evening with his “best girl.”

A FOOTBALL-PLAYER.
If I could paint you, friend, as you stand there,
Guard of the goal, defensive, open-eyed,
V/atching the tortured bladder slide and glide
Under the twinkling feet; arms bare, head bare,
The breeze a-tremble through crow-tufts of hair ;
Bed-browed in face, and ruddier, having spied
A wily foeman breaking from the side,
Aware of him—of all else unaware.
If I could limn you, as you leap and fling
Your weight against his passage, like a wall;
Clutch him and collar him, and rudely cling
For one brief moment till he falls —you fall;
My sketch would have what Art can never give—
Sinew and breath and body ; it would live.

“Six years ago, I had an attack of
Indigestion and Liver Complaint
that lasted for weeks ; I was unable
to do any hard work, had no appe-
tite, food distressed me, and I suf-
fered much from headache. My
skin was sallow and sleep did not
refresh me. I tried several reme-
dies and consulted a doctor, with-
out obtaining any relief; finally,
one of my customers recommended
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla. It helped me
from the first, —in fact, after taking
six bottles I was completely cured,
and could eat anything and sleep
like a child.”

Dear Bulletin, —Has the wetting of the
coal anything to do with the combustion of recent
Newcastle (N.S.W.) cargoes? Shipping linseed
and wheat loose was knocked off at Riga (Baltic)
in ’69 or ’7O on account of cargoes taking fire.
I was on board a brig, the Annie, of Riga, loaded
with linseed, loose, and her cargo took fire on
account of part of the linseed having been wet.
As luck happened, we were forced to put back to
the Bolderaa on account of ice in the Bay of Riga,
and were therefore in port when the fire was dis-
covered. And, later on, when employed at New-
castle, I noted that the small coal-heaps at the
Waratah Co’s old tunnel, and the coal-heaps at
the A.A. pit, all took fire from the ins ide. — Walter
Goodwin.
Melbourne Age and Argus had never a
nasty remark between them to pass upon the inci-
dent of Lawyer Geake’s absconding from his bail.
A very few days before the vanished swindler was
wanted at the Criminal Court the merits of his
case were argued before the Full Court. Where
was Geake at that time ? Didn’t he meet any of
the lawyers or barristers who appeared for him on
appeal? If not, didn’t they know that he had
bolted ? And if he was about when his conviction
was upheld by the Full Court, how came it that a
duly sentenced criminal could escape from justice
without the police troubling themselves in the
matter ? Geake, from that moment, should have
been shadowed by the myrmidons of the law, and
presuming they couldn’t then see him they ought
to have started looking for him right away. Why
thisprofound newspaper silence concerning Geake’s
escape under such unpardonable circumstances?
and is the Victorian Law a dog that it should be
kicked aside by the first attorney whose leg it has
chanced to grip ?
Now, sing' a song of lawyer Geake,
Whose crafty tongue is in his cheek ;
They “ wanted ” him the other week—
He stole what wasn’t his’n.
His Honor called the truant’s name,
The grinning crier did the same,
But lawyer Geake he never came
To put himself in prison.
Good Geake was held in high regard
Until, when proved a knavish card,
He got two years, with labor hard —
At least that was the sentence.
Meantime he wandered forth “ on bail ”
And went to Jainberoo by rail,
Or, possibly, preferred to sail
To Hingland for repentance.
He “ cut his stick,” which wasn’t odd;
For, though a common thieving clod
Must always take a trip to qi od,
The sinfullest attorney
Is different from one of such :
Conviction doesn’t hurt him much,
He breaks from Nemesis’s clutch
And makes a nicer journey.
So, sing a song, in joyful strain,
Of justice treated with disdain ;
The law may seek its Geake in ' ain
He got a chance of clearing.
Whilst judges grave confirmed h s cass
He went to find the missing mac. ,
Observing, “ Now’s the time and spacs
For easy disappearing.”

A Wonderful Cure.
Herr Rassmussen. August, 1894.
Dear Sir,—ln the year of 1871 I was eight days,
in the water sheep-washing, and contracted rheu-
matism and stiffness in the joints, and have tried!
all advertised medicines. When I came to Sydney-
I had a great difficulty in walking, and went to.
the Turkish baths, which did no good. Passing
your window I saw a testimonial from Mr. E.
W. O’Sullivan, M.P., with the same coinplaint as
I had, which led me to try your Remedies. On
Thursday before Good .Friday I took the first .of
your Pills; since then I have used 4 boxes Special
Powerful Alfaline Vitality Pills, 3 boxes Special
Powerful Alfaline Rheumatic Pills, with Liver
and Kidney Pills, and free use of your Alfaline
Eucalyptus Oil, and I am now, with the blessing
of God, as well in health as I was 23 years ago.
I can with great confidence recommend your
Remedies to anyone suffering from the same com-
plaint. May you long be spared under God to
be a blessing to suffering humanity.
I remain, dear sir, yours very gratefully,

Dear Bulletin, —It is not correct that
N.S.Wi State school headmasters have heretofore
been paid according to the certificate held. Many
l ’2A ’’'teachers in charge of seventh-class schools
receive A 2171 a year, while scores of men holding
“2B ” Certific ites (a grade lower) are in charge of
sixth-class schools at =£2os a year. The fact is,
that teachers have heretofore been paid according
to the class of school held. Each class of school
had a certain salary attached to it, and the teacher
in charge got that salary no matter what certificate
he held.— Cave.
Concerning N.S.W. Govt. Astronomer
Russell’s 19-year cycle theory in explanation of
droughts, three of which he can make out and
trace more or less distinctly, the inland squatter
has long since cut the years up into sixes, with an
occasional seven thrown in—which fits in with the
scientist’s plans. On this theory a good many
tree squatters almost cleared their holdings two
years ago, and began stocking again early this
year. Except in the far west of N.S.W. (where
there is not in scores of holdings enough grass to
muster on for shearing) these buyers can already
see about 100 per cent, on their purchases.
A man can live without fire, without books,

not surprising that the name of Mr. W. Jno.

far and wide, and that his unequalled stock brings
testimonials and recognitions from all parts of
Australia. He has the knowledge that can be
/ained only at the great Sheffield manufactories,
and, besides, he has the long Australian experience
which makes him right up to date in supplying
cutlery to every section of the community. He
has three registered designs, and one patented
design of his own; he has farmers’, boundary-
riders’ knives ; veterinary knives and instruments
in new and special form; butchers’, cooks’, sports-
mans’, hunters’ knives ; sawbread knives, carving
knives and forks ; table cutlery ; and the grandest
Usplay of pocket-knives in Sydney. He has a
sj lend id stock of razors ; beautiful strops, made of
Yustralian leather by Australian workmen ; and
an endless variety of scissors. Any man or woman
>n need of cutlery should call or write for price-list

in order to encourage country and intercolonial
trade, does not charge for postage on cutlery to

ABRIDGED PROSPECTUS.
TIIHIS company is projected for the purpose of acquiring from the Perth Brick Syndicate Limited, as
-L a going concern their brick-making business on the Canning River, Perth, West Australia, includ-
ing about 26 acres of freehold land, plant, &c., and for the purpose of purchasing and erecting the
most approved brick-making machinery in order to extend the present business.
The property has been thoroughly examined by Mr. G. C. Inskip, F.R.1.8.A., the well-known
Melbourne architect, who was sent to Perth especially for the purpose. Copy of his report can be
seen at the offices of the brokers.
The freehold, consisting of about 26 acres of land, contains a valuable clay deposit most suitable
for the manufacture of bricks of good quality. It is situate on the Canning River, about 10 miles
from Perth, and a similar distance from Fremantle.
Special attention is called to the following matters : ,
1. The building trade in West Australia is very brisk, and there is every indication that it will
continue so for some years.
2. The demand for bricks of good quality is greater than can at present be locally supplied.
3. Bricks are now being imported from the eastern colonies at a cost of 30s. per 1000 for carriage,
to which has to be added losses for breakage in handling.
3. This company will be the first in Perth to possess suitable machinery for the manufacture of
bricks on a large scale, and it will take over a sound business as a going concern, including the
very large existing contracts.
It will probably hereafter be deemed advisable to extend the operations of the company to other
centres, such as Coolgardie, Kalgoorlie, Menzies, etc.

TO MINING COMPANIES, BATTERY OWNERS
4 AND OTHERS.
Increase your yields by Saving the Fine Gold
and Pyrites by the use of
Wynne and Tregurtha’s
Patent Battery Plates,
This Invention, lately patented, revolutionises the ordi-
nary battery treatment of ores, for by its use copper-
plates, quicksilver, and chemicals are entirely dispensed
with. The Wynne and Tregurtha Patent Battery Plates
are made of iron, cast with peculiarly-shaped ribs. They
are fitted in a wooden frame, and take the place of the
ordinary copper-plates and blanket tables. The tailings
on leaving the stamper boxes pass over the plates which,
from their construction, catch the fine gold and pyrites,
allowing the sand and water to flow away. When the
plates are fully charged with the concentrates they are
then tilted backwards by means of a lever, throwing the
contents into a trough underneath. In practical use
much better results have been obtain'd by these plates
than by' the ordinary copper ones, the yield of gold being
increased by fully 10 per cent. Excellent results have
been achieved in the treatment of refractory ores, where
the gold is associated with some foreign mineral, whiph
has proved deleterious to the mercury and causing the
loss of the gold. The plates are strong, simple in cqn
struction, and easily handled, and can be obtained from

THE ALEXANDRA DEEP LEADS COM-
PANY is projected for the purpose of
acquiring all the right, title, and interest of in and
to applications for Four Mining Leases, compris-
ing an aggregate area of 169 acres, known as the
U7T. Flat, situate on theU. T. Creek, Alexandra,
and for which Leases are now being issued ; and
also to provide capital for developing And working
the alluvial ground contained therein.
These Leases are at the foot of the gullies con-
taining the well-known and rich mining claims
known as the Homeward Bound and Lucky Leads,
from which enormous yields of gold have been
obtained. The said Leads run directly into the
Flat proposed to be acquired and worked by this
Company, and are distant about one hundred
yards from the boundary pegs of the Leases.
The U. T. Flat has been tested by boring, and
by sinking a trial shaft to a depth of 130 feet, when
bottom was reached, the result of which wiL be
seen in the statements of Mr. W. Hartley and Mr.
W. Hewett, subjoined. Subsequently, a full-sized
.haft was sunk to a depth of 128 feet, and timbered
'.lie whole distance, but had to be abandoned m
xmsequence of the Tangye pumps then used prov-
ing unsuitable for the work by becoming choked
with the sand and graved encountered when getting
into the wash, and the capital being utterly insuf-
ficient to persevere with the work. This shaft is
on the land comprised in the present Leases, and
may prove of great value hereafter, when drained,
for air or timber purposes.
The following, taken from the official pamphlet,
entitled “ The Neglected Goldfields of Victoria,”
and the Alexandra Times, published in 1875,
shows the gold obtained, and dividends paid, by
some of the mines on these leads :

The sinking is easy, and can be let on contract
for from 20s. to 30s. per foot to a depth of 150 feet.
Sawn timber can be obtained at 10s. per 100 feet
delivered.
It is proposed to obtain much more suitable and
powerful machinery than was used before, and to
procure tho advice and assistance of thoroughly
qualified experts m selecting machinery and sites
tor commencing operations.
The Reports of Capt. W. J. Begelhole, Jewell-
s' 10 ''' 11 mining expert; Mr. Samuel K. Vickery
Surveyor-General of Victoria; and Messrs!
Haitley and Hewett,. prove conclusively the bona-
fide nature of the undertaking, with very reason-
able prospects of yielding handsome returns upon
the capital invested, and the Provisional Directors
have every confidence in recommending it to the
attention of the investing public.
Over 8000 shares have been subscribed for in
Alexandra, and 8000 are reserved for Walhalla
and the balance will be allotted strictly according
to priority of application. 6
Applications for shares may be made to the
Brokers,, or to the Manager pro. tern., from whom
any further information may be obtained.
Report by Capt. W. J. Begelhole.
In accordance with your instructions I have
made a careful inspection of the Alexandra Deep
.Leads Company s leases, consisting of IG9 acres
situated on the U.T. Creek, Alexandra.
T consider the property well worth developing.
I am quite prepared to join, and will advise my
friends to do likewise, in providing funds for that
purpose.
There is no doubt in my mind-as to the exist-
ence of a deep alluvial lead in that portion of the
valley secured by you.
Taking into consideration the large amount of
gold won from the leads in the various gullies, and
that the trend of all these leads is in the direction
of the land secured by you, I am of opinion that
when the main lead, which, must run through your
property , is properly opened up, it will prove to be
ot a highly payable character, and will handsomely
repay all wno take part in the venture.
The reefs in the adjacent rising ground, which
' lav ® yielded such large returns in the past, also
trend directly into your leases, and the general
indications lead me to form the conclusion that
the several lines of reef will junction at a depth in
your property.
I should estimate that about J 23000, judiciously
expended, will prove the property successfully.
I am, Gentlemen, yours faithfully,
W. J. BEGKLHOLE.

Dear Bulletin, —Why does the press
always print it “ swagsman ” ? Neither in bush,
nor in town, have I ever heard a man, in ordinary
talk, say “swagsman.” It was always, whenever
that intended word teas used (which is seldom
now), “ swagman ”or “ swaggy.” Who invented
“ swagsman ”? And why ?—Dipso.
Dear Bulletin, — Woman rarely cuts her
throat; neither does she shoot herself, and
very rarely hangs herself. Can any of your
readers say why ?—or why, also — re the woman
who threatened to suicide because her husband
remained undisturbed by the fleas which were de-
vouring ha —do women fuss so much more than
men about fleas ? Is it more accessible garments,
a thinner skin, a livelier imagination or, do
women taste better than men ? —“ A.”
A Wesleyan missionary’s unpremeditated
public confession concerning “ the good work in
Fiji :
The Catholics, however, had not been able to share the
spoils.
“ Share the spoils ”is excellent. The good pastor
goes on to tell how —
A chief left the Wesleyans and joined the Romans
simply because he had quarrelled with his brother, a-nd
could not, on that account, worship in the same place
with the latter
“ Allee samee ” civilised Kerristian “ long-pig.”

A Westralian outlines for The Bulletin
his experiences of Japanese Bridgets :
A few experiences of Jap. house servants under assign-
ment will be interesting to the uninitiated. When the
assigned boy arrives you find he cannot speak much Eng-
lish-knows very little about cooking—is very polite and
willing and exceedingly handy—provided you have the
patience to act as instructor After three months you
find a boy who is all cunning, can speak enough English
to make himself understood, and has been well drilled by
other experienced house boys. Then the trouble begins
boy becomes sulky, will kick your feet at every oppor-
tunity, throw slops out of the window, burn the clothes
when ironing, sing all day long in a painful Jap. mono-
tone, and when reprimanded tell you it’s nice singing.
He will leave the kitchen dirty and do every possible
thing to annoy you. Should his friends arrive he will
“shout” for them at your expense, should liquor be
handv, and calmly tell you he has done so. You patiently
bear'it all—for he is a two-year assigned servant—until
you at last ask him what he means by it all. Then, in
broken English, he will explain : “Me not get enough
wages—only 10s. per week—other boy get 25s.—me got
no clothes —me want you lend me £5 ” —. You
distinctly decline-and off to bed goes your boy. No
more work for you till you accede —he s sick. One
lady imprisoned her boy for refusing duty She
called upon me after the trouble, and I ordered
my boy to bring two cups of tea As the boy was
rather long I rang again, and in he marched with one
eye shut, his face all chalk-lined, and carrying a
Jap. sandal on a tray—no tea—and impudently offered
my friend the sandal, bowing to the ground and retiring
backwards from the room. They had boycotted her.
Once they get sulky you must either grant their demands
or dismiss them, for they are then useless and an annoy-
ance. Once I threatened to imprison my boy, and he
coolly replied, “ Gaol more better.” You must allow then-
ample time every afternoon to bath in warm water ; about
this they are very particular. As soon as all is cleared up
at night, out goes the boy till daylight next morning, and,
should you want supper, you must provide it for yourself.
If you leave the plates for the boy to wash up, you’ll cer-
tainly hear about it next morning in anything but choice
language. When their friends call, your work is sus-
pended, and you endure their noisy merriment Visitors
must be allowed. This is the conduct of the assigned
boy gathered from many experiences. But, when the
Jap is free, all this changes, and he becomes a very good,
clean obedient servant. While he is assigned on small
wages you “cop out.” [Not astonishing Assignment
evidently means slavery.— Ed. B.]

Wliat nine months “ solitary ” means in
Nj.S. W. When sentenced to three years or up-
wards the prisoner is kept in the local gaol (where
convicted) until a batch is ready, when he, with
others, is transferred to Darlinghurst, which is a
“ distributing ” gaol, The journey is made in
irons. In Darlinghurst he is kept in what is
called “ transit ” until he has passed the doctor as
fit for separate treatment (i.e., solitary confine-
ment). When the Comptroller - General deter-
mines to what gaol he shall be sent for his
nine months’ solitary, he, with others, with
rivetted irons on his ankles, is sent by rail to
the chosen spot. For 23 hours out of the 24
lie is confined in a silent cell, on a limited diet,
hearing no voice. One hour in the 24 he has for
(solitary and silent) exercise. At the end of six
months, he gets an extra hour per day for (solitary
and silent) exercise, and is allowed 2oz. of coarse
sugar daily. During the nine months he neither
receives nor sends letters. If his wife or children
die he hears nothing of it. At the end of nine
riionths he mingles with other prisoners, and is
often a fit subject for a lunatic asylum.
Suggested that N.S.W. Govt, should
acquire the originals of the late Lueien Henri’s
sketches for his unique work on “The Australian
Decorative Ai-ts,” and have them reproduced by
the Govt, printer. There are many worse ways of
spending public funds.
The ordinary business man’s most critical
difficulty just now is how to get his money in. In

success.*
Seen and Unseen, a Brisbane spiritualistic
paper, conducted by Theodore Wood, lately
printed “a 20-minutes’ address by Jesus of Naza-
reth, specially delivered for this paper, and taken
down in shorthand from the medium’s lips.”
Ordinary journalism has evidently no show with
the Mellon or pumpkin variety. Singularly
enough, however, the sentiments ascribed to Seen
and Unseen’s interviewer were precisely similar
to the mediumistic hogwash which any ghost
of any Smith can twaddle by the hour. The
signature may be. the signature of Esau, but
the voice is a. ways the voice of Cissy.

It is specially-tempered, perfectly hollow ground, rings like a bell and never requires grinding. We
can highly recommend it to the general public. Being practical tradesmen ourselves, we
know the exact kind of edge that is required to ensure an easy shave, and, having had them in use for
a number of years, can testify to their merits. We guarantee each Razor for Two Years.

SYDNEY CABBIES!
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
In 1879, the year of Sydney’s International
Exhibition, the city’s cabs increased from 500 to
700, and with prosperous years the number rose
till ’B9 saw the maximum—l32o. “ The depres-
sion ” has knocked off the odd 320. Eorty years
ago there were only three two-wheelers. The
driver of one of them, Bannister, still on the stand
at the Exchange, is a cabman with a history. He
was a Eureka stockade, and escaped from the
Govt, troopers with his two horses and dray; and
the morning after the Dunbar wreck he helped
to hold the spar from which Johnson’s rescuer
was let down the precipitous face of “the Gap.”
Johnson was drawn up “shivering, in blue shirt
and blue trousers ; he would have drunk off the
whole of a bottle of brandy, but was only allowed
a sip.”
* * * *
A first-class cab costs over <£100; a good
horse, £l5. Expenses of two horses, cab repair, &c.,
mean up to 355. weekly. A cab-license costs per
year 305.; a driver’s license, 7s. 6d. Three-fourths
of the cabmen own
and drive; many
mortgage their cabs
and horses. One-
fourth rent cabs from
owners of yards about
the city; the rate is
6s. 6d. per day for a
cab and one horse,
10s. for a cab and two
horses.
* * *
Cab - horses which
have no stable-mate
often do 365 days’
work a year. Three-
fourths work Sun-
days ; daily hours are
ten or twelve. The
oldest nag is a 24-
year-old grey, with
18 years’ cab-service.
“ He’s a good ’un yet,” says his driver affec-
tionately. There are several ex - steeplechasers
“on the ranks.”
* * * *
Here is a typical cabman’s story : “ One
pourin’ night, when only ‘ Mad Micky ’ and me
was on the stand, two rather swell blokes kiddin’
drunk rolls up out of the rain and mist, and one on
’em sez, ‘Drive us to Coogee,’ namin’ ‘ the Castle.’
So up I gets and drives ’em. Well, when we gets
near the big place they pulls me up and gets
out and I see they’re both sober. One bloke gives
me a bob. ‘ What’s this for ? ’ I sez, feelin’ mad
enough to get off and pull their tongues out. ‘ It’s
all you’ll get,’ he sez, ‘ and if yer don’t like it and
make a row we’ll deal it out to yer.’ In a moment
I’m down and stoushing him on the point. He
falls and the other bloke bolts. I holds my man
till he comes to and I sez, ‘ Yer’ve got the biggest
cheek of any man wot ever wore clothes ; how am
I to make a livin’ drivin’ you out ’ere for a bob ? ’
I knowed then he didn’t belong to the big place,
so I makes ’im get into the cab and he tells me
where to drive. Passin’ a paddock he outs —but
I’m with ’im. He knowed just where to drop on
the holes i n the palin’s every time—but I was with
’im. He comes to a lane, slips down it, then turns
into another and like a wmk he’s over a back
gate. Just as he lands I grabs his ’at. ‘ I’ll keep
this,’ I sez, ‘in case yer want to give me brusher.’
He swarms up a back balcony-post, swings from
the balcony on to a shed roof, runs along it, and
disappears in another paddock. I goes back to
the cab with the ’at; I have that ’at still.”
* * * *
A cabman’s commentary on the Law :—“ It
pays to have a s’licitor, because a man always
feels he’s summoned unjust until he’s beat, and a
s’licitor often fogs the beak—’specially if the beak
has been in a perlitical depitition or convival
evenin’ the night afore. Once when two on us
were joggin’ down Pitt-street we was brought up.
The other bloke had a lawyer to defend him and
got fined 30 bob; I defended meself and got
two quid. The beak sez, ‘ I alwus find the wurst
men defend theirselves—two quid,’ he sez. Oh,
the beaks and lawyers wink the other eye at each
other all right; I ken prove it. One on us blokes
were loiterin’ in King-street one day and was
nabbed and brought up and charged with loiterin’
in King-street. *Oh ! ’ sez our bloke’s s’licitor,
‘ the charge don’t say wot King-street—Newtown,
or Melbourne, or ’Evin or Herth.’ ‘Do you press
that point ? ’ asks the beak, just as simple as if it
were the fusst time he had heerd of it. ‘Of course
I do,’ sez the lawyer. ‘Case discharged,’ sez the
beak. Lor, didn’t our bloke stare ! He didn’t
know where ’e are for a month after.”

Sometimes a cabman wins :—“I was drivin’ a
fare down one on ’em Bondi ’ills when a copper
yells out to me like he was struck ratty. ‘ Wot
are yer barkin’ at,’ I sez. ‘ Stop !’ he sez. I stop.
‘ I’ll show yer,’ ’e sez, ‘ wot I’m barkin’ hat; wot’s
yer name and address? ’ ‘ There’s my number,’ I
sez, ‘ that’s all yer want. ‘ Where’s yer ’ome ? ’
he sez. ‘My ’ome is wherehever hi am when the
nightfalls on me,’ I sez. ‘Ho!’ he sez, "ow
funny you’are.’ ‘’Opes yer like it, ole feller,’ I
sez. So he takes my number, and soon enough
brings me up afore his own fancy magistrate—the
bloke wot fines cabmen <£2 for what the other
beaks fine ’em 2s. 6d. for—an’ he swears agin me
for furious drivin’ —nearly running over people—
a very strong tale. ‘ ’Ow fast was he goin’ ? ’ asks
the magistrate. ‘Tour miles an hour, yer wur-
ship,’ he sez. Blue me, that’s where the funny
part come in, and it made even the beak laugh. I
was discharged that time.”
* * * *
The cabman doesn’t like the “sham toff ” who
“ comes up and sez, ‘ cabby ! Railway Station !
drive like the wind ! ’ You cut out a twenty-five
minute drive in a quarter of an hour. He gets
out; knocks his cigar-ash off on the wheel; sez
‘ Fine turn-out you’ve got, cabby ! deuced fine
turn-out! ’ and, blue me, if he don’t give you a
shilling. ‘ Well,’l says, ‘yer ’ort to keep a cab
of yer own!’ “No doosid imperdence, cabby,’
he sez, “ no doosid imperdence, or I’ll give you in
charge ! ’ Whenever you see a cabman with his
hat on one side and scratchin’ his head, wond’rin’-
like, it’s because he’s just had a fare like that.”
* * * *
Men tell cabby to “go like h—1”; women first
say, “Is your horse quiet, driver?” and next,
“ Please drive steadily. ” There are twenty male
fares for every woman; the clergy don’t cab it.
In the rosy days of 10 or 15 years ago, an old
Exchange-stand cabman sometimes fluked =£lo a
day, often £2O a week, and always averaged £G
per week the year through. Now, despite his
regular customers, he is in luck’s way to make a
weekly =£4. Fifteen years ago a certain Queens-
land squatter, who used to stay at the Exchange
Hotel, would for three months together give his
cabman never less per week than £l2. On leaving
Sydney, when driven to the wharf, he would pre-
sent cabby with a parting “fiver.” When the
banks smashed in ’93, the excited depositors rush-
ing hither and thither made good business ; but,
when the hot hubbub died away into cold depres-
sion, the cabmen suffered terribly. Many stood in
the ranks for two days of 12 hours each without
earning a shilling. The best-known averaged but
255. a week for many weeks. Things have im-
proved a little, yet Christmas last was to many
cabmen as poor as midwinter. Country visitors to
town have become quite as careful with their silver
as town people.
S. A. MILLS.
An English curiosity is a policeman whose
heart beats so loud (mitral murmur) as to be aud-
ible through his clothes at a distance of several
feet.
A farmer at Tooradin, Yic., lately found a
hive of bees, in full working order, inside the
dried-up carcase of a dead bullock. The find
panned out a kerosene-tinful of honey. Another
testimony to Biblical truth ! See Judges, xiv.,
where Samson found a hive of bees in a lion’s
carcase, and bet the Philistines 30 sheets and 30
change of garments that they couldn’t guess his
riddle : “ Out of the eater came forth meat, and
out of the strong came forth sweetness.” Where-
upon the Philistines stewed their brains over the
puzzle for a week, and finally got so mad
that they went to Samson’s wife and threatened
to burn her father’s house down if she didn’t
screw the answer out of Sam. Accordingly she
worried the poor devil till he told her, “ because
she lay sore upon him,” and Sam lost his bet—
which he paid by going down to Ashkelon, with
“the Spirit of the Lord upon him,” and slaying
30 men whose clothes he collared. “If ye had not
plowed with my .heifer,” he told the Philistine
bookies, “ ye had not found out my riddle”—and
“ Samson’s wife was given to his companion whom
he had used as his friend,” which was a nice,
friendly thing to do.
Vie. railway department has posted a notice
“ trespassers will be prosecuted” at the
an unfenced cutting, 70ft. deep, on the Outrun
line. The first trespasser was dead when he
reached the bottom, so proceedings weren’t taken
in his case; but two others who went over the
department’s man-trap in the dark are slowly
recovering in the hospital, and it is understood
that, when they are convalescent, what remains
of them will be pursued with the utmost rigor of
the law.
Strenuous efforts are being made by moral
Melbourne shopkeepers to wipe out the itinerant
flower - sellers, particularly the females. The
Mayor told a deputation “ he was quite aware of
the danger of moral contamination to which the
she] flower-sellers were exposed.” Hem !
Stout, K.C.M.G. (Maoriland) : “ There is
less freedom in the N.Z. Parliament than in any
other Parliament in the civilised world.” Stout is
evidently going downhill mentally. When a man
begins to lose his powers of expression and his
sense of proportion, and has to emphasise himself
by saying that the small thing he objects to is the
worst or the biggest or the ugliest thing in all the
woild, he is obviously decaying. When his mental
decay gets very bad ne loses his hold of his super-
latives, and then he tries to emphasise himself by
putting big capital letters all over his communica-
tions. That is another stage of the complaint.
After that he begins to write all in capitals, and
to say that everything is the most dreadful thing
on earth, and next he drops out of sight altogether.

“ Since using Pears’ Soap
I have discarded all othersi”
Two Cockies .
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Their selections adjoined. Some work had
been done; slab houses and bark sheds had been
built, and a few acres on the ridge cleared and
fenced ; but the initial energy had waned and the
joy of grubbing and splitting on their own land
departed. Any reason was now good enough for
adjourning the planned improvements.
* * * *
It was quite a month since Steve started to
grub the big ironbark behind the shed. This day
ho began with a brave heart; got down among the
roots and into the hole as large as a tank; dug
tediously at the red clay that covered the black-
snake roots, jabbed at the stones that blunted his
tools, the lace of fibres that barred his way, till at
last he was able to use the axe effectively to sever
one more of the giant’s claws. But the sound of
the axe aroused Abe, who in the next paddock had
been regarding a broken fence with an uneasy
feeling that he ought to mend that “someday.”
With his hands in the top of his pants, he strolled
over to where Steve was working, climbed the
fence, squatted on the top rail, pulled out a plug
of tobacco and a knife, and began to fill his pipe.
This made it necessary for Steve to lay down the
mattock and fill his pipe.
“ I wouldn’t bust myself if I were you, Steve, to
iut that tap. Put a rope in her, and we’ll pull her
down.” -
“So 1 was thinking, Abe; but I ain’t got a
lope, and you ain’t got a rope; so what’s the use
talking?”
“ Then let her rip till a ‘southerly ’ comes and
locks her out.”
The two men surveyed the tree, the hole, the
heap of dirt, in silent, smoking contemplation.
■Steve’s muscles relaxed their tension ; his sense of
obligation to “see that tree down before dark”
weakened. Abe expectorated at the hole at the
tap-root and missed. Steve, spitting in social
lompetition, also missed ; but spoken words could
not have better expressed their opinion of the job
before them.
“ What say, Steve, if we go and have a look at
that blaokbutt near the high rock ? I'll bet a
crown there’s a bees’ nest in the third limb.”
“ You don’t say! Why, I’ve looked that tree
over and over scores of times.”
“ It’s there right enough. One of my kids found
it going to school. You take your cross-cut, and
1 11 bring an axe and bucket.”
“ 1 don’t care if I do, Abe ; it’s too hot for hard
graft anyway.”
Day after day this pretence of work was gone
through ; when it was not a bees -nest to chop out
it was a wallaby-hunt, or an unbranded calf, or
a cow near calving that required running in. No
crops were planted worth speaking of ; no money
earned that could be calculated. How food of the
very roughest was provided remained a secret
known only to their wives and the trusting store-
keeper.
* * * *
It chanced that a bullock had died in the
swamp, and the two men going down to skin it
returned with the hide on their shoulders, mightily
pleased, for it promised a few shillings of ready
money. Drawing near home they could hear c in-
tending cries, the shrill, voices of their wives
quarrelling.
“ I tell you my dad was a real gentleman ; kept
a hotel; and we two servants —yes, two ser-
vants.”
“I’m sure ! An old man who hung round the
stables, and an orphan child who ran away because
you did not give her enough to eat. Hotel, indeed !
Say grog-shanty ! ”
“Grog-shanty yourself ! It’s like your impu-
dence. Who are you, I should like to know? Why,
your father was only a poor cocky, and you never
had a shoe to your foot till you wore your old
man’s bluchers ! ”
The men, coming up, tried to pacify them ; but
only to be assailed in their turn as weak-spirited
creatures.
This was not the first outbreak on the part of
the two wives, but, so far, it was the most serious ;
and the men’s soothing voices were drowned in the
screams of the women as, half-led, half-dragged,
they were taken back to their doors.
* * * *
So the feud began. That day the women
reiterated to their husbands all the wrongs they
had suffered ; the utter worthlessness of the other
family ; how articles had been borrowed and never
returned ; how “she,” that woman they had done
so much for, had said this, had said that; how the
husband was a lazy good-for-nothing, who idled
his own time and other people’s—till at last the
men, from being peace-makers, were drawn into
the strife and for days after avoided each other.
One day the pent fire burst forth. Abe was on
one side of the fence ; Steve on the other.
“ Where’s that swingle-tree I lent you, Blake ? ”
“ I don’t know, and I don’t care. Where’s the
money you owe me for half the dividing-fence ?”
“Pay for half that fence ! That dry-rotted,
white-ant-eaten fraud ! Why, it would drop to
bits if a cow looked at it. It never was worth a
curse, and if you had any pride you’d burn it.
Pay for it, indeed ! You just ante-up that swingle-
tree ! ”
“Now, none of your pointing, Pye; just you
pay for that fence, or I’ll make you. ”
For hours, with wearying iteration, the discus-
sion continued, the voices rising higher and
higher. The sins they had done, the sins they
had not done—all were raked up in long impreca-
tion. In a fury of mind, and perhaps to dare his
adversary, Abe harnessed up his horses to the
plough, using the swingletree so much spoken of.
Up and down the land the horses toiled, Steve
standing by raging and impotent.
“ You call that ploughing ? If I couldn’t turn a
better furrow than that I’d drown myself.”
Abe plodded on regardless of criticism ; and
Steve, fire in his eye and shaking with excitement,
also harnessed up his horses. Presently the two
men were both ploughing, each in his own orchard.
All day long they toiled, with only the necessary
pauses to rest the horses, each waiting for the
other to “ knock off.” Dead to fatigue, regardless
of blistering sunshine, they labored till darkness
sent them indoors.
Next morning the sun had not risen when they
recommenced their task ; each covertly surveying
the other’s work and condemning it as altogether
bad; each resolved to show his superiority, both
in quantity and quality, as a laborer.
A week later Abe'commenced cutting a Scotch
drain at an angle across his orchard. Its outlet
was at the dividing-line of the lower paddocks.
“The scoundrel ! ” cried Steve to his wife ; “ he
wants to run all his drainage on to my grass. I’ll
be level with him.” Thereupon Steve cut a drain
to meet Abe’s, and no damage resulted to either of
them, but much benefit to their fruit-trees.
Abe’s oranges had the scale; he rigged up a
spraying-machine and cleaned them. Steve, after
scouting at the new-fangled foolery, followed the
example. For the competition in work had
developed into a competition in orchards ; early
and late the men were pruning, harrowing, mulch-
ing, chipping. At evening, design or accident
always brought them to the dividing-fence.
“ Where’s that swingletree I lent you, Blake?”
“ Where’s that money you owe me for half the
fence ? ”
‘ ‘ Call yourself a man ? ”
“ Not if you are one, you loafer.”
So they scolded and railed night after night.
* * * *
Month after month, year after year the
feud lasted ; the rage of the men seeming to feed
on their nightly brawl. And financially they
prospered ; no two orchards like theirs were to be
seen for miles around ; bigger and bigger cheques
came from Sydney agents ; and if Steve was the
first to open a bank-account, Abe led the way in
buying a sulky. Then Steve built a brick house,
and Abe went one better with a stone one. Steve’s
boy went to boarding-school; Abe replied by send-
ing two girls to college. The same pride was
shown in their live-stock. When Abe bought
Clydesdales, Steve bought Suffolk Punches; Ayr-
shire cows in one paddock stared at Jerseys in the
other ; and the Langshan rooster crowing in one
yard was promptly challenged by the neighboring
Leghorn.
But neither time nor prosperity blunted the
animosity of the men. Long ago the wives would
have made it up; but the husbands would hear no
good of each other or the other family, and
after their nightly brawl retired to their suppers
with unabated wrath, heaping imprecations on
“ that blanked scoundrel Blake!” “that worth-
less loafer Pye ! ”
One summer, after a short sickness, Abe Blake
died, and the widow, selling out to advantage, left
the district. Steve took no pains to conceal his
satisfaction.
“That’s one good riddance, Missus. I believe a
bad neighbor is the greatest curse in God’s world.
We’ve had no peace now for seven years.”
Steve welcomed the new owner with effusion ;
but his wife noticed that he now slackened greatly
in his work. He often wandered aimlessly about
—up and down the track by the dividing fence by
preference —muttering to himself. When he came
in, the wife would inquire what he was saying.
“ What a blessing it is, Missus ! What a bless-
ing it is to have a good neighbor at last ! ”
* * * *
The orchard was neglected ; weeds and scale,
aphis and white lice bred unchecked. Steve did
not seem to notice or care about that, or anything
else. Mrs. Pye looked on in despair at her home
and orchard going' to rack and ruin ; nothing
roused the once-energetic Steve from his nerveless
apathy. And so the family" might have drifted
into the back-wash .of disaster from which they
had emerged, but. for the lucky chance that in-
duced Steve to join a lodge. Of course, his wife
opposed the idea ; she knew what he was when he
got into company ; and her forebodings were not
belied, for had it not been for the sobriety .of the
horse the master would hardly have reached home
that night. The wife, sitting up anxiously, heard
the gate open, and, waiting for the expected foot-
fall, heard instead her husband’s voice in loud
altercation, and in the words she could catch there
sounded to her something familiar. Opening the
door, she crept out on to the verandah. It was
bright moonlight, and there, over by the dividing-
fence, was Steve gesticulating with waving arms
and stamping feet.
“ Where’s that swingletree I lent you, you
scoundrel ? . . Want me to pay for half your
rotten old fence, do you ? . . I’ll see you fur-
ther first, and your fence, too ! . . Call your-
self a man ? ” and so on. ’Twas the old, old story
once again.
Steve came into the house at last, hot with his
old rage and scorn, and the next day and for many
days lie slaved with old-time vigor to overtake the
arrears of work. But gradually he slowed off ;
the impetus given by his outburst slackened ; and
his former lethargy returned— only to be dissipated
later on by another fit of drunkenness and an-
other verbal war with the shade of Abe Blake over
the dividing-fence. So that, in time, Steve’s wife
came to regard his periodic visits to the lodge as a
wise dispensation of Providence, and, waiting
anxiously in her bed at night for his return, she
listened with sleepless eyes till the old familiar
words rang out on the night.
“Where’s that swingletree I lent you, you
scoundrel ? Want me to pay for half your rotten
old fence ? ”
Only then she turned to rest, closing her eyes on
the pillow with satisfied content, and murmuring
to herself : “ Thank God ! Steve’s drunk again ! ’

with the rabbits. I lay big odds on bunny. After
trapping thousands of him I thought I knew
something about his capabilities, but two of him
surprised me the other day—up near Darraweit
Guim, on Deep Creek. A farmer’s son and I were
out shooting a few, when the dogs chased a couple
into a hollow stump, as upright as they make ’em.
The dogs entered after them but couldn’t reach
either. I stooped down and looked up, and found
the stump hollow all the way up. I stand six feet,

shoulders, raised himself to the top and looked
down. He said he could see one bunny but
couldn’t reach him. We got some bark and dead
wood and lit a .fire in the stump, the inside of
which, being ant-eaten and dry, blazed up fiercely,
For a few seconds there was tremendous squealing
inside, then one bunny fell down into the fire, and,
though badly singed, made off, and the other
scrambled, out of the top , and proceeded to make
himself scarce likewise. The dogs caught both,
