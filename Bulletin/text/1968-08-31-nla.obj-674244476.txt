In short, the Atlas of the London Times presents our world
and its features in more detail, more accurately than any

ments for school library subsidy.

able; to ensure your own personal copy, post the coupon

tured heavy library cloth, with two hundred and forty pages
of maps in full colour and 300 pages of information and
statistics, the World Atlas of the London Times is available
at just $29.50 cash. And, for such a unique work, this price
is unbeatable. (In England, this Atlas will sell for $33.88.)
Actual volume size is approximately 18" x 12" x 1 3 A" (closed).

One more week
THE LAST HURRAH
CRUSHED in the middle of a swaying
and almost senselessly desperate crowd,
the defence of cultural freedom sud-
denly became less important than the
protection of personal safety. An hour
earlier, the cause had seemed worth
fighting for: support the “Friends of
America Hurrah” by attending an unex-
purgated free public performance of
Jean van Itallie’s play in Sydney’s
Teachers’ Federation theatre; that would
show N.S.W. Chief Secretary Willis that
not only hippies and fringe lunatics
wanted to see four-letter words scrawled
across the stage. There might not be
room for all our names on the indig-
nant letterhead — Kym Bonython,
Adrian Deamer, Russell Drysdale, Tony
Morphett, Professor Allan Stout, and
Peter Sculthorpe. were, after all, names
that mattered. But we could do our bit
by turning up for the show. Stir the
old apathy, be actively non-conformist
Among those who turned out to be not present at the free Sydney presentation
of the banned play “America Hurrah”
for a change. Hey! This protest business
feels good. It was a fiasco.
Causes have a way of evaporating
when a woman has a stiletto heel
through the toe of your right shoe, and
shoulders, chests, and knees are violently
reducing the distance between your
body and plate glass. And when the
people behind the glass the very
people for whom you’ve turned out, on
a bitterly cold night, to support are
standing there smugly shaking their
heads and staring out at us as if we’re
a bowl of piranhas, then it is time to
wonder just who we are fighting, exactly
what we’re protesting about.
The idea (brewed by Tony Morphett)
was to gather a group of notable Aus-
tralian cultural freedom-fighters behind
a legal loophole, which allowed every
syllable and gesture of the “America
Hurrah” trilogy to be performed so long
as no charge for admission was made.
In the face of such a token protest by
people of position, intellect, and artistic
status, Mr. Willis presumably was to
have felt small and foolish. Now one
thinks of him sitting back, large and
laughing.
After planning the performance in
secrecy, and swearing those in the know
to silence, the organisers suddenly
bruited it all over town in large adver-
tisements. People began queuing outside
the Teachers’ Federation building at
5.30* p.m., and when the doors opened
at 7.45 there was a crowd of more than
1500 jamming Sussex Street. Everybody
wanted to be a Friend of America
Hurrah, but after the first 500 had
filled the theatre the glass doors were
locked.
The subsequent chaos left dozens
among the crowd waving tickets for
reserved seats and demanding to be let
in. “My husband’s a personal friend
of Daniel Thomas and we must get
in,” said a wo'man, becoming shrill.
“Sydney Morning Herald here. The
Herald must get in,” yelled a voice
up front. “Slip it under the door,”
replied a wit at the back. By now,
credentials were being flourished all
over the place; a ticket alone just
wasn’t enough. With no response
at all from the faces behind the glass,
the mood of the crowd grew angrier.
Bodies were pressed together more
obscenely than ever you’d see on stage.
“Where’s my Sprayfresh?” asked
someone, more in truth than humor.
“What the hell am I doing here?”
asked a University of New South
Wales lecturer rhetorically.
When a paddywagon and three car-
loads of police arrived, dignity seemed
beyond retrieval. Whether the organ-
isers liked it or not, the event had
attracted a lot of people whose
behaviour qualified them for inclusion
in Mr. Willis’ “hippies and lunatic
fringe” gibe. The police, tolerant, but
in no mood for nonsense, quite obvi-
ously judged the whole thing as just
another rowdy demonstration and
weren’t impressed by any individual’s
credentials or pure motives.
It was difficult to feel mature and
responsible when police eyes obviously
saw it as a mob of maniacs fighting to
get in to a dirty play. By the time
a spokesman for the organisers un-
sympathetically yelled that all seats
had been filled, that no one else would
be allowed in, and that we should all
go home, the Friends of America
Hurrah had lost a lot of friends.
THE ITALIAN GIRL
WE NEVER expect entirely to under-
stand store promotion and we remain
completely baffled by the decision of
Woolworths to bring pretty Italian film
actress Maria Pia Conte here to pro-
mote a new range of corsetry.
In the first place, Miss Conte doesn’t
speak English, so all the nice things she
might have had to say about the
corsetry had to come through an
interpreter. In the second, Miss Conte,
being an established actress, couldn’t
be expected to model the “puff-fibre
filled bras with sneaky little features
lovingly lined with nylon” and the
“super tummy flattering, cunning, non-
roll-up girdle, all at rock bottom
prices” in the new range. The best we
could get were assurances that she was
wearing them underneath her dress.
However, Woolworths were happy
and, no doubt, the promotion was suc-
cessful. Miss Conte was found for them
by a Hollywood agency, which
pronounced her “the perfect symbol
of the younger generation.” One Wool-
worths man suggested that there might
be a connection in the fact that the
new range of corsetry was called St.
Mark’s, and Miss Conte, he believed,
came from Venice, which also has a
famous St. Mark’s.
TOOTH TEAM
YOU MAY BE fascinated to hear that
next October the Culinary Olympics
take place in Frankfurt and what’s
more Australia is sending a team.
Naturally, The Bulletin was keen tn
know whether our culinary Olympians
would have bottle-green track suits,
blazers, and all the proper gear. The
answer is no track suits, but
they will have chef uniforms with
the appropriate Australian badge on
the left breast, and they will have
green blazers.
Our team is Les Smith, Claudio
Magris, Harry Kahn, Frank de Kon-
ing, Dave Sanders, and Cyril Butler.
Last week there was a gathering at
the Southern Cross Hotel in Mel-
bourne so that the world could meet
them. Les Smith, the team manager
and catering manager for Dennis
Hotels in Victoria, said they would
be competing over nine days against
16 other nations, and competition
would be fierce. There would be com-
petition for many gold medals, in-
cluding one for national dishes.
Our team is taking these dishes:
Fillet Steak Merimbula, Crayfish
Capricornia, Jumbuck Cutlets, Veal
Steak Myee, South Australian Whit-
ing Adori, and Seafood Moomba.

training. Every Sunday since February
Les Smith and his team have trained
together, baking these dishes over and
over again. It has left their mark
on them. Les Smith has gone up from
15 to 16J stone and now he is cut-
ting down on all bread and potatoes.
We also met Paul Laesecke, a
master chef for H. J. Heinz in Pitts-
burgh. He has won a gaggle of gold
medals from previous Culinary
Olympics and he is now a judge. We
gathered this was a most arduous
duty. Wine judges can use a bucket
of sawdust. Food judges, he said, have
actually to eat the entrees, and with
16 nations putting in food it can be
a long hard day. On judging day, he
has no breakfast and no dinner.
He has been in Australia for five
weeks, and as a former U.S. team
captain he has given our team solid
training advice. This, too, has been
a cause for worry. He has put on
seven pounds.
The Bulletin, in order to help the
training run, unselfishly ate a Crayfish
Capricornia and two Jumbuck Cut-
lets, washed down with some Dray-
ton’s Hunter River White. There are
no altitude problems in Frankfurt
and the feeling is our gold medals
prospects are better than in Mexico.
HELPING HAND
THE $5 MILLION allotted by the
Federal Government in the Budget for
the education, housing, and health of
Aborigines is hardly lavish after the
endless talk from the Government on
the subject; it is made to appear
even more niggardly against the recent
bequest of Sydney businessman Norman
Catts of his estate, gross $400,000, for
the education of Aboriginal children
in New South Wales.
Mr. Catts died at the age of 83
on the eve of National Aborigines’ Day
last July. He began his working life
in the mail-order department of
Lowes Ltd., a chain of menswear shops.
In 1913 he started New Century Press
Limited and two years later co-founded
Catts-Patterson, at that time one of
the dozen-odd advertising agencies in
Sydney.
In 1945 he founded Ajax Chemicals
Pty. Ltd., which he sold only four
years ago. He kept his directorship of
Ferro Corporation (Australia) Pty.
Ltd., of which he was chairman for
15 years, until two years before his
death.
Mr. Catts worked for the N.S.W.
Society for Crippled Children from its
beginnings in 1929 and became a life
governor of the society.
Eight years ago he told the N.S.W.
Aborigines Welfare Board that he pro-
posed to will money for the education
of Aboriginal children. In the mean-
time he gave substantial help to a
Save the Children Fund campaign to
establish pre-kindergarten schools on
Aboriginal reserves.
All their own work
I believe the N.S.W. Police Com-
missioner, Mr. Allan, is a man of high
moral standards and impeccable
integrity. I do not criticise him as an
administrator but I just don’t think
he is a good policeman.
—Mr. S. Einleld, N.S.W. MLA in Parliament
Russia is determined that Czecho-
slovakia shall not be used as the
corridor through which the Soviet
Union will be attacked. This legiti-
mate argument is ignored by people
in all Australian political parties
anxious to proclaim their dedication to
liberty.
—Mr. Arthur Calwell, before the Russian
invasion of Czechoslovakia
I don’t think Mr. Wallace (a mem-
ber of the Sydney Water Board) is
qualified to criticise the safety pre-
cautions of our Lion Park. I wouldn’t
presume to judge whether Warragamba
Dam is safe or not.
—Mr. J. B. Gibbon, managing director of the
Warragamba Lion Park, near Sydney
It is hard to conceive that a socialist
state can violate the freedom and
sovereignty of another socialist nation.
—President Ceausescu of Rumania
There is no doubt in my mind that
the lake is still the best site for Can-
berra’s Parliament.
—British city planner Lord Holford
Students today are idealistic, hard
working, and deeply concerned with
human suffering.
—The Vice Chancellor of Queensland
University, Sir Fred Schonell
I don’t think the new National
Gallery looks like Pentridge at all.
There’s very few openings on the
outside wall, because they needed the
hanging space.

in the middle of the room is Mr.
Humph Barry’s biggest exhibit look-
ing as yuk as anything. It is called
I Was Reading These Books When I
Felt 111, and is a blue ring containing
a couple of dozen books splattered
with the contents of two and a half
dozen tins of Campbell’s potato salad.
No, Russian salad. There, isn’t that
the yukkiest thing? says Mary. It’s
a bit off, says 15-year-old Auguste
Blackman. It is beginning to smell, and
Kym Bonython’s trying desperately to
look amused. He’d like to say what
fun. But can’t. Today is turning into a
trying one. Don’t they all in Mr.
Bonython’s life? This morning a bitch
on heat shoots through the gallery with
attendant suitors. This afternoon that
Bob Rogers fellah tries to do a two-

but rain squelches that. And now Mr.
Bonython, on a cloud of Faberge after-
shave lotion, has another disturbing
thought. Which is: My God, he hopes
there’s not a Frank Clune bopk under
that mess.
The thing about Mr. Humphries’
work is it’s a bit enigmatic for some.
Is it possible, they ask after a couple
of glasses of wine, is it possible there
is some hidden intellectual meaning
beneath, for instance, Nigger Brown
Gloves (Obstetric) with yard-long
forefingers which he knitted himself and
is for sale at $65? And Pus on Ice,
a pair of brown-leather ice-skates ooz-
ing out rubbery custard, $B5O. They
wanted the custard to be really set, so
Mr. Humphries’ secretary, Miss Thigh,
stirred up three packets of custard that
morning. And Shoe scape, a frame
filled with old shoes from a tip in Mel-
bourne, $5OO, and Forkscape, which
is mashed up cutlery coming alive, also
$5OO. What about Soapholder? A
plain, green, china soap container. Not
For Sale. Nigger Brown Trousers
with (disgusting fun) fly-buttons knee-
high on the right leg, $65. Thank
Heaven for those straightforward car-
toony things of Ten Little Austra-

Niggers who are: Hughes, Chifley,
Menzies, Calwell, Gorton, Jones, Cur-

middle by Willie Weeties Esq. Mr.
Humphries took a week to paint them
in a hotel room. Actually, says a lady
in knee-socks and gaiters, they’re quaite
naice.
At this point Mr. Humphries arrives.
His audience relaxes. And he goes
round shaking hands and is very kind
and attentive to old ladies and the
Press, and writer Tony Morphett in-
clines his head from 6|ft. up and says
this is turning into a fun-party. His
hair, though, is blond short-back-and-

cut and bleached when his show opened
in Adelaide in July. Looks sexy, too.
Those other hairs seen on stage are

came across a bi-plane.
Couldn’t help commenting at the time
how planes have changed.
And Eastern is way ahead. In 1971,
for example, the first of Eastern’s Lock-
heed 1011 ’s will go into service.
The L-1011 will seat up to 300 people
yes 300 in the most superb cabin
luxury imaginable.
There are 8 spacious, individual seats
across the width of the cabin, with 2
aisles for easy access and passenger
convenience.
The L-1011 will have a self-contained
kitchen (a large 13 feet by 15 feet), with
ice-makers, refrigerators and high
speed ovens.
Another new feature of Eastern’s
L-1011 is the inclusion of 6 entry doors.
This means passengers will be able to
board 3 times more quickly than on
today’s jets.
All in all, Eastern is doing more than
just looking to the future. Eastern has
the future all taken care of . . . with
its super fleet of Lockheed 1011 's.
What a way to fly!

ONE MANSLAUGHTER
MAY BE ANOTHER
MANS-LAUGHTER
“MISS BARDOT in this scene is bed-
raggled but still alluring.” That sen-
tence, encountered in a magazine,
aroused my first interest in word-
divisions. By the placing of a hyphen
at the end of a line of print, a familiar
word can be transformed into a new
and interesting _ one. The term bed-
raggled well describes the appearance
which successful actresses are expected
to display in most contemporary films.
. Printers in their daily work are
keenly aware of the hazards of word-
division. They steer clear of recognised
traps, such as referring to therapists as
“the-rapists.” But the placing of
hyphens at high speed in such a way
as to avoid changes of meaning is a
tricky task. Now and then, I am glad
to say, something escapes their vigil-
ance, and in the process a useful word
may be born.
This occurred in a published account
of the ambitions of a talented Austra-
lian girl. It said: “She is hoping to
make a career as a chore-ographer.”
Some such term, for a person who
writes about chores, has long been
needed. I myself have composed occa-
sional essays on dish-washing, lawn-
mowing, and other humdrum tasks. It
is encouraging to learn that I was, in
fact, practising the reputable art of
chore-ography.
In a Melbourne newspaper I came
across the pleasing word “semi-nar.”
The semi-nar referred to was held at a
university to discuss Australia’s foreign
policy. The value of the word lies in its
clear implication that, however long a
semi-nar may last, it is only half as pro-
tracted as a nar. A nar is a conference
of truly intolerable tediousness. This
fact, I believe, will raise the morale
of people who attend semi-nars.
A similar type of word-division lately
produced the convenient phrase “demi-
litarised zone,” to signify a region
where only half the population is inter-
ested in literature.
English papers sometimes use the
term “deb-auchery,” meaning partici-
pation in amorous revels with debu-
tantes. Deb-auchery is said to be com-
mon in the new permissive society of
Britain. It is one of the practices which
—as a leader-writer put it—“bed-evil”
the country today. There is no form
of evil quite so difficult to eradicate
as bed-evil.
By alert reading I have been able to
make a modest collection of creative
word-divisions. It is only a beginning,
but these specimens may give others an
idea of what to look for:
Archety-pal: a friend with whom one
spends a gay evening. The word may
have its origin in the notorious rowdi-
ness of medieval archery clubs. Archety-
pal who go out on the town end up,
all too often, by engaging in deb-
auchery.
Bra-zen: a mystical cult of Japanese
origin. Its devotees claim to achieve a
state of ecstasy or nirvana by contem-
plating brassieres. Tnere are frequent
references to their aggressive tendencies,
e.g., “Student rebels have behaved with
bra-zen effrontery.”
Chuck-ling: a game popular in cer-
tain parts of Europe. Ling is a kind of
dried fish, and young peasants amuse
their girlfriends by throwing pieces of
it at each other. “They passed a pleas-
ant evening, with much singing, drink-
ing, and chuck-ling.”
Enti-cement: a type of cement made
in the Entiat Mountains, Washington,
U.S.A. Flirtatious girls of that region
make gifts of it to plumbers and handy-
men: “At first he seemed indifferent to
her; but he could not long resist her
enti-cement.”
Opera-tic: a facial twitch which
develops in persons who attend lengthy
operas: “A performance of Wagner’s
‘Rheingold’ will begin the opera-tic
season.”
Pat-riot: a noisy demonstration by a
crowd of Irishmen. Such occurrences
are less frequent now than they used to
be. A Dublin newspaper lately asked:
“What has happened to the spirit that
once inspired our splendid Pat-riots?”
Pee-rage: a sudden fit of anger
induced by a person’s inability to find a
public comfort station: “English people
have a traditional respect for the pee-
rage.”
Perv-ade: a stately dance performed
in the 18th century by men dressed in
women’s clothes.
Prof-ligacy: a sum of money inherited
from an Irish professor. “His lifelong
career of dissipation began with the
prof-ligacy of his youth.”
Scab-bard: a poet who continues to
write verses during a poets’ strike. Such
men were unpopular during the Renais-
sance period. Hence the frequent state-
ment: “He thrust the sword into (or
pulled it out of) the scab-bard.”


THE COMING REVOLT OF THE CITIES
Comment by 'Observer'
IT LOOKS as if the anti-city nonsense
of generations of Australian rhetoric
and Government policy might at last
be blown away. As with the domina-
tion of politics by new political leaders
with a contemporary look, a concern
with the city as a political matter
began in South Australia, but it now
looks as if it could soon become a big
issue in Federal politics, and later in
State elections. It was, after all, one of
the most promising things about the
false dawn of Mr. Gorton’s rise to
power that he said that national devel-
opment included the development of
the cities. Now that Mr. Whitlam has
used the Budget debate to cast the
shadow of an election campaign in
which he would campaign for city
rights, Mr. Gorton has a chance to
match him at the same game now. He
could hand over 4 foreign policy and
military planning to those members of
his Cabinet and the public service who
are better at it than he is and become,
instead, the first Australian Prime
Minister to show a creative concern
for that majority of Australians who
live in cities.
Something like six Australians out
of ten live in cities with populations of
more than 100,000. If you throw in
the smaller cities and the environs of
the big cities you have something like
two out of three Australians living in
city complexes, or in big towns. In
fact, more people live in Sydney alone
than in all the rural areas of Australia
combined. It has been one of our
characteristic talents to be able to
group together in cities so that more
of our people can enjoy urban ameni-
ties than in almost any other nation,
just as it has been a characteristic
talent for Australia to be, on the
whole, highly efficient in farming so
that not many people have to live in
the rural areas. But, although remark-
able mainly as a successful urban and
big landholding community, we have
for generations wasted hundreds of
millions of dollars on contrary policies
of decentralisation and small land-
holdings, thereby putting impediments
in the way of our own efficiency.
On the face of it the Labor Party is
freer than the Liberals to take up the
cause of the cities because it hasn’t
got the Country Party around its neck.
But part of the tensions of the Coalition
Government may have come more from
unimaginativeness and lack of drive
than from irreconcilable conflict. Some
of the more grandiose examples of
anti-development, such as the Ord
River scheme, really do the Country
Party as little good as they do the
Liberals (or Australia) and within the
Country Party, and among rural
industry leaders there is now consid-
erable awareness that it may be better
to restructure the few inefficient rural
industries than to go on subsidising
them.
Within State politics what seems
needed is less talk of State rights and
more talk of the rights of the cities.
State-righters and State Governments
can sometimes be the main enemies
of the cities. One of the real social
and economic questions of Australia is
how our urban complexes can be liber-
ated from those things that clog up
their development, and it may be that
a smaller administrative unit than a
State Government is more suitable to
this task. Take N.S.W. About 70 per-
cent of the people of this State live in
the coastal area which includes New-
castle, Sydney, and Wollongong. But
you wouldn’t think so if you looked at
the forms of State Government. There
is no administrative institution to
equal this reality, yet it is likely that
this mid-coastal region, with its con-
centration of so much of the industrial
and commercial activity of Australia,
might be best thought of and admin-
istered as a whole. The rest of
N.S.W. is quite different from it and
what does for the rest of N.S.W. may
not do for the Newcastle-Sydney-
Wollongong complex.
Something like 3,000,000 Australians
live in this region now, and it is not
likely that anything is going to stop
this population expanding to 5,000,000
or 6,000,000 by the end of the century.
As it stands now its population is about
a quarter of the nation’s total. What
happens in this region matters to Aus-
tralia more than what happens in any
other region because this area, in
human terms, and in ecoriomic terms,
is the largest single part of Australia.
But it is not thought of as one region,
but as three disconnected regions,
with some bits and pieces in between.
In Newcastle the Hunter Valley
Research Foundation is doing some
good work and the State Planning
Authority seems to be acquiring extra
importance, but nobody is giving
coherent thought to the development
of this particular area as a whole.
Yet, there are not many other regions
in the world so fortunately situated for
the expansion of an urban complex in
a way that would be pleasant to those
who live in it. Present thinking does
not seem to go beyond the idea of
letting Sydney sprawl out west to the
Blue Mountains-and then perhaps die
of asphyxiation, yet along the coast
north and south of Sydney, there is a
wonderful chance to set up satellite
cities that, connected by Japanese-style
transport and laced with beaches and
inland waters, might attract the immi-
grants of the future.
RUSSIA INVADES AUSTRALIAN POLITICS
Comment by Alan Reid
SOMETIMES it was hard last week to
know which interested Federal Parlia-
mentarians more: the effect of the
Russian intervention in Czechoslovakia,
or the effect of this action upon their
electoral prospects, both short term and
long.
While there might seem something
cold-blooded about weighing a tragic
happening in terms of the local electoral
outcome, it is inevitable. Politics is a
continuing thing. Outside events, how-
ever regrettable, do affect internal
politics, and Parliamentarians and
Party leaders of all hues realistically
accept this and make their assessments
accordingly.
The Liberals could see advantages.
The growing tendency has been to
accept that the Communist world,
especially Russia, has been moving
genuinely toward peaceful co-existence
and the establishment of a world order
under which the risks of further wars
would be reduced. Russia was even con-
sidered as a force working for a solution
in Vietnam.
This has had the effect of minimising
the electoral appeal of the Govern-
ment’s anti-Communism and the policies
that have flowed from it, including
the insistence that Australia should
devote a significant portion of its
resources to defence. It has also had the
effect of reducing the electoral appeal
of the Government’s claim that Aus-
tralia’s military presence with the
United States in support of the anti-
Communist regime in South Vietnam
was necessary if Australia was to do its
part in keeping Communism distant
from Australian shores.
Prior to the Russian action there was
no reason for critics of the Gorton
Government to be inhibited. They
could complain about the inadequacy
of the rise given pensioners in the
Budget, niggle about the inadequate
tempo of Australian development, point,
as Opposition Leader Gough Whitlam
did last week, to the desirability of hav-
ing a WC with running water in every
Australian urban home, and feel that
they had large and significant griev-
ances.
But then Russian tanks rumble
through Czechoslovakian streets, the
Czechs lose their right to self-determin-
ation, national political leaders disap-
pear from the scene as though they had

never existed, individuals die, and sud-
denly Australians are jolted into real-
isation that their luck could run out.
In one way it produces a situation
which will make it much more advan-
tageous for Mr. Gorton to go to the
electors this year. The electoral atmos-
phere, in the opinion of Liberal
strategists, would be better suited for
their side of politics.
Yet in another way it makes it more
difficult for the Government to go to
the electorate unless it has a clearcut
issue that has no overt connection with
the Czechoslovakian crisis. Otherwise it
would be open to the charge that it was
cynically exploiting the tragic plight of
the Czechoslovakian people.
Labor will be trying not to be forced
into a position where it provides the
Gorton Government with an issue extra-
neous to the Czechoslovakian situation
but which, nevertheless, would enable
the Government to pull on an election
in a political atmosphere created by the
Czechoslovakian crisis.
Their former Leader, Arthur Calwell,
had given them worry last week. After
Mr. Whitlam had issued an earlier
statement describing the Russian action
as “unconscionable,” Mr. Calwell had
made a broadcast on the “Labor Hour”
over 3KZ in Melbourne in which he
stated, “I see as much virtue in the
Russian case as I do in the Czech one.”
When, after Mr. Whitlam’s statement,
Mr. Calwell was asked if he wished to
withdraw or alter his broadcast in any
way, he said, “No, I don’t. I stand to
every word on it, all else notwithstand-
ing. I refuse to jump on any band-
wagon on this issue.”
There was relief when he crossed the
Chamber to take his seat on the Gov-
ernment’s backbenches for the resolution
of support for Czechoslovakia.
But the possibility of a division of
opinion on the issue is the danger that
Labor faces, and it was to avoid this
danger that Whitlam needlessly
blurred his condemnation of the Russians
with his references to the United States
and Australian presence in Vietnam.
Oddly, the resolution moved by the
National Executive of the Communist
Party condemning the Russian action
was more forthright than the Whitlam
statement. The Communist Party had
a sideswipe at the “Gorton Government
and its United States mentors,” but it
was very much a sideswipe. The side-
swipe was restricted to a paragraph.
The rest of the lengthy resolution was
devoted to a forthright condemnation
of the Soviet’s action.
The three Parties Liberal, Labor,
and Communist are alike in seeing
the Czechoslovakian crisis affecting
domestic politics. The Liberals view it
as strengthening them electorally by con-
firming the value of their anti-
Communist attitudes. Labor views it as
making urgent the necessity for delaying
an election until emotionalism has sub-
sided. For the Communist Party it rep-
resents a further divisive factor in their
once-monolithic Party structure.

“Henry’s two-bob
sideshow”
built to last
10,000 years
By BATMAN
OPENING NIGHT...a touch of Camelot
ALL THE WEEK Melbourne was
agog over the opening of its new Arts
Centre. The director, Eric Westbrook,
said the citizens beat with their fists
against the glass doors, pleading to be
let in. One gentleman forged a letter.
It purported to be from Westbrook
and Roy Grounds, granting him full
facilities to look over the place, but
still he did not make it.
The story goes that the Toorak
black-market price was $6O for tickets
on opening eve, and on opening day
they actually hit $75. There was much
agony, much chagrin among the
uninvited. There was the tale, too,
about the Toorak matron who organ-
ised a pre-opening party, drinks at
6 p.m. before they all went on to the
Arts Centre together at 7.30. Then,
oh horror, she failed to receive an
invitation.
There was no hope of getting in
without an invitation; the organisa-
tion was perfection. There was the
same sort of precision as was used to
get each soldier on the correct portion
of the beach at the exact time during
the Normandy invasion. The left-hand
lane of St. Kilda Road was blocked
off only to Gallery invitees. On Tues-
day, you had to have a yellow circle
on the windscreen of your car and
burgundy tickets, and on Thursday
you needed blue tickets and pale blue
triangle sticker for your windscreen.
Dress on Tuesday was superbly
optional, there was a choice of lounge-
suit, black tie, or the full bit white
tie with decorations. Among the
artists, Sir William Dargie was white
tie, Fred Williams was smooth in a
dinner jacket, Charles Bush was even
smoother with one of those fancy bow
ties that fold under the collar, John
Brack was fine in a lounge-suit.
On the opening night 2000 people,
gathered into the Great Hall, most of
them trying to carry on conversations
while looking upwards at the gorgeous
kaleidoscope of Leonard French glass.
Sir Henry Bolte made his speech and
officially declared the Gallery open.
Now, the Great Hall, with its bluestone
walls, is medieval in style even to the
galleries looking down from way up.
In the galleries at either end there was
an RAAF band and trumpeters. There
was such a touch of Camelot, one
almost expected Richard Burton to
step forward.
Then they played the superb George
Dreyfus fanfare, composed just for
the night. It went for two minutes. At
the finish, Roy Grounds waved his
fist and cried, “A beauty.” After this,
the champagne, the caviar, and the
oysters didn’t stop flowing until
10.30 p.m.
On Thursday night, the affair was
more exclusive, this was the banquet.
This time there were 450 people in the
Great Hall, silver ice buckets and silver
candelabra on every table. The menu
was smoked salmon, oysters, caviar,
consomme, fillet of barramundi meun-
iere with almonds, rolled roast tender-
loin of baby lamb rosemary, Gipps-
land camembert, followed by creme
brulee. Old campaigners who had suf-
fered a thousand State functions said
that better wines had never been
served, Rhinecastle brut champagne,
Drayton’s 1967 Riesling, Hardy’s 1965
Shiraz blend 458 A, Brown’s Milawa
1962 late-picked riesling, and Sea-
brook’s brandy. As they warmed their
brandy, they recalled the old Exhibi-
tion Building built for the 1880 Inter-
national Exhibition. Never again would
it be used for a great State function.
This was the end, the era of the Great
Hall had begun.
There were visitors from all over,
gallery directors from U.S.A., England,
Italy, and expatriates like Sidney
Nolan and Arthur Boyd came home.
Dr. A. van Schendel, director of the
Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam, made the
response on behalf of the guests. There
were telegrams and cables, too. The
most poignant was from Hal Missing-
ham of the N.S.W. Gallery. It said
si’mply: “Half your luck.”
There were a few critics. There was
the character who stood outside the
Gallery all Tuesday night holding a
placard “BAN ’ENRY’S TWO 808
SIDE SHOW.” What with tickets
being worth $75, I don’t think anyone
took his advice.
There was the conversation reported
in a St. Kilda Road tram. First lady:
“What’s that building, dear?” Second
lady: “I don’t know, but I think it’s the
new Glaciarium.” Some have com-
plained that the entrance hall, with the
water running down the window,
reminds one of the older butcher shops,
and it should be offset with a plastic
fern and a chop or two. But the most
general complaint was about the for-
midable outside, that the unbroken
bluestone wall, with its moat, is a little
too implacable, unyielding. Some
people wondered whether, having been
allowed inside, they would ever be let
out again.
Roy Grounds, on opening day, stuck
to his original philosophy. This was
meant to be a timeless building, a
building designed not to detract any
from the works of art that it con-
tained. Furthermore, now that he had
seen the building at last, full of what
it was meant to contain, one noticed
the building even less. This was what
he had intended, and he was satisfied.
But what about the bluestone? To
those who could see it turning to the
most sinister tones of Pentridge black,
Roy Grounds replied to that. The con-
sultant Professor E. S. Hills, the geolo-
gist, had said that in 10,000 years time
the stone would look much the same
as it is now. “Except that it will have
acquired a slight bloom with age,”


added Mr. Grounds, quietly triumph-
ant.
There was a fine Melburnian
feeling of security, like the building
of the great Cheops pyramid, knowing
that it would still be there in 10,000
years.
Of course, the interesting point is
where does Melbourne go from here.
So far, eight million cubic feet have
been built. According to Roy Grounds,
if everything is approved and goes
according to plan, there are still ten
million to go. There’s the tower
restaurant, and all the underground
complex of theatres. In the present
optimistic flush of enthusiasm, chances
look good, but Sir Henry has to
approve the money. Yet your corres-
pondent, who is often accused of
being cynical, believes that what we
have now is the most beautiful gallery
he has seen and one of the great
buildings of the world. The Mel-
bourne collection is now housed as it
should be housed.
And this city, which has never had
an honest tourist attraction, never had
a true symbol, a sort of classic article
to display on a calendar, certainly has
it now.
WHEAT
THE NEW FORMULA
IN A RADICAL move away from agri-
cultural protectionism, the Government
last week announced it considered “it
was no longer appropriate for the prin-
ciple of cost of production to be used
for setting the guaranteed wheat price.”
This is a view which the Government’s
advisers have expressed for many years.
But even though the Government has
rejected cost of production in principle,
it retains certain features of the formula
as a simple concession to wheat-
farmers. Local buyers of wheat will
have to pay a home-consumption price
still based on a cost-of-production
formula, though a revised one. And
even though the guaranteed exports will
start with a base price close to the
estimate of the free-market price, this
will be adjusted each year by an index
of “production costs.”
Wheatgrowers can be expected to
howl loudly. Next season exports under
the price guarantee will bring only $1.45
Anthony ...“a generous scheme”
a bushel compared with $1.64 this year.
In itself, this will reduce wheatgrowers’
incomes by around $4O million. But
they will be compensated to the extent
of some $4 million by a 6c rise in the
home-consumption price of wheat.
Background to the affair has been the
vast expansion of the wheat industry,
based on rapidly expanding Govern-
ment subsidies. The Budget brought
down recently provided $43 million for
wheat-industry subsidies this season,
compared with $l7 million last year.
The Government calculated that if it
were to continue with cost-of-produc-
tion estimates as the basis for its price
guarantees, it would be up for some
$5OO million over the next five-year
agreement, compared with the $95 mil-
lion it has doled out during the five
years of the expiring agreement.
The $1.45 will be only 2c a bushel
above the expected price on world
markets in 1968-69, so the subsidy
element will almost have vanished from
exports. But in the final four years of
the agreement, the subsidy element will
become significant again, as the cost
index is applied. The Government has
accepted the plan on the basis of esti-
mates which show that, over the whole
period, it will have to outlay some $6B
million to wheatgrowers. They are
assuming an average realised price on
world markets of $1.43,. and cost
increases each year of four percent. By
1973 the guaranteed price on export
wheat will be $1.57 and subsidies will
be running at $2B million a year.
This is just a juggling with cost
figures to get a predetermined level of
subsidy, it was admitted by a senior
member of the Government last week.
There is no longer any real faith in
cost of production as a rational means
of fixing price guarantees. It is now
admitted quite freely to be part of a
deal with wheatfarmers.
Mr. Anthony said he thought the
new scheme was generous to the
industry. Over the five-year period as
whole it certainly is, no other industry
can expect to be getting $2B million a
year in 1973. But in 1969 it will only
be getting the tiniest subsidy.
The plan is going to be costly poli-
tically, since it will put tens of thou-
sands of wheatfarmers offside. It will
also push up the price of bread and
eggs slightly. But it will save the
Treasury $4O million next year, and if
Mr. Gorton is intending to leave the
election until then, he will be pleased
to have that money up his sleeve.
THE SENATE
VICTORY FOR DISSENT
THE SENATE has been prone to mak-
ing occasional shows of strength of late,
but last week the Upper Chamber
flexed its 67-year-old muscles with a
vengeance and wrote several pages of
its own history in the process. After a
three-day debate, the Senate became
the first house to vote for the site of
Sir Alister
McMullin
Senator Murphy
the new and permanent Parliamentary
buildings; forced a precedent decision
on Standing Orders; and delayed the
weekly political exodus from Canberra
by several hours.
In one of the biggest majority
decisions the Senate has ever made,
the Upper House thumped the propon-
ents of a Parliament House beside Lake
Burley Griffin (including John Gorton,
Gough Whitlam, and the National
Capital Development Commission) by
42 votes to six. Said one Parliament
House wit: “With two notorious losers
like Gorton and Whitlam combining
for the lake, it had to be the hill.”
On Tuesday, the lake men succeeded
in deferring the House of Representa-
tives’ debate on the site for at least a
month—until the Budget debate is con-
cluded, presumably to dangle a few car-
rots and change a few minds. But a
similar attempt to defer the Senate’s
decision failed miserably. The Govern-
ment’s lake supporters on Thursday
tried to proceed with normal business,
which would have allowed the site de-
bate to lapse. But Labor, the DLP, and
Independent Senator Turnbull were
aware of the Government plans the
night before, and after question time
ended on Thursday set about forcing
the House to come to a decision.
Labor’s Senate Leader, Lionel
Murphy, moved suspension of Standing
Orders but failed to win an outright
majority (31). President Sir Alister
McMullin ruled the absence of an out-
right majority negated the motion.
Murphy objected, moving dissent from
the ruling. After argument, Sir Alister
said Standing Order 448 demanded an
absolute majority, and he felt inclined
not to allow the dissent motion. After
further argument, he. declared the
motion out of order and proposed to
proceed with normal business.
Murphy dissented again, claiming the
motion was clearly favored by a major-
ity in the Chamber. “The president is
the servant of the Chamber—he is not
the master of the Chamber . . . when a
serious motion of dissent is put forward
it is no part of your (the president’s)
function to decide you will not allow
it,” Senator Murphy said. Then, citing
the Constitution, added “the Senate is
the master of its own procedure.”
Sir Alister told the House he was


merely attempting to uphold Standing
Orders, but finally, when the vote was
taken, Murphy’s second dissent motion
was upheld and the Senate went on to.
discuss the original dissent motion,
passed it, and at last the hill men were
able to start the site debate.
The Senate was expected to rise at
5 p.m. on Thursday, and a number of
Senators, anxious to wing their ways to
warmer climates, had booked on flights
from Canberra beginning at 5.20. But
the day-long debate discussing
what the Senate should discuss (some-
thing the Senate is becoming increas-
ingly reputed for) put an end to those
plans. The site debate (with only two
speakers supporting Government Leader
Senator Ken Anderson on the lake site)
lasted until 10 p.m., but despite the
delay in fleeing Canberra, the lake men
agreed it was all worth while.
BRISBANE
TRAMP, TRAMP, TRAMP
AT THE END of last week, nearing
its 20th day, Brisbane’s bus and tram
strike was really beginning to hurt. It
had cost the Brisbane City Council’s
Transport Department more than
$160,000 ($300,000 in lost fares, less
normal running costs) and the strikers
had lost more than $120,000 in wages.
The limping public was past caring
about issues; it wanted its transport
back.
So far, six conferences called by
Industrial Commissioner Pont had been
abortive, although he had said that the
only question which appeared insur-
mountable was the Lord Mayor’s re-
fusal to guarantee, prior to a resump-
tion of work, future employment for all
30 tram and bus employees likely to
be affected by the conversion to all-bus
operations.
Business houses, which put on a
casual face early in the dispute, were
beginning to admit the pinch, with the
Retailers’ Association expressing con-
cern at the extensive drop-off in trade.
Only bookmakers and service station
operators were busy. The normally
bustling department stores in the city
and the Valley retail area were further
hurt last Tuesday when trains (which
had won new custom because of the
dispute) went out for four hours at
peak shopping time, as part of a
Queensland-wide industrial stoppage
over flow-on from the Metal Trades
judgment.
Brisbane, sprawling and very de-
pendent on public transport, had to
find other means of travel, and the
Transport Commission allowed the
city’s 1000 taxis to multiple hire to
move workers from the scattered
suburbs.
Suburban motorists responded to the
frequent radio appeals to pick up walk-
ing workers. Others, more ingenious,
such as Mr. Lionel Devencorn, of Camp
Hill, brushed the dust off their 1910
Brisbane: No trams or buses for nearly three weeks
Emblem motor-cycles to beat the
transport hold-up.
Hopes grew on Thursday night that
the strike could be resolved by Monday
when Brisbane’s State schools resumed
after their two-week August vacation.
This followed a six-hour Trades Hall
conference between the Lord Mayor,
Alderman Clem Jones still fighting
off the ravages of a bad attack of flu
—the Trades and Labor Council’s dis-
putes committee, and Tram and Bus
Union officials.
Proposals reached after much dis-
cussion were to be presented to a mass
meeting of the near-1600 striking mem-
bers of the Tram and Bus Union. But
as late as Friday night the 14 execu-
tive members of the Tram and Bus
Union could not decide when they
would call a mass meeting of the strik-
ing men to discuss Mayor Jones’ offers
made at the .marathon Thursday night
talks.
Suggestions were that it could finally
be held on Sunday, opening up the way
for a resumption of work on Monday
if the men who struck on August 6
decided to return to their jobs.
Only one thing was sure the Ash-
grove-Grange tram line (whose con-
version to buses had sparked off the
dispute) would never again echo to the
rattle and rumble of trams.
By the weekend, overhead power
lines along part of the route had bden
torn down by Council employees, en-
suring that trams would never again
pass that way. Lord Mayor Jones had
made his pre-emptive bid.
PUBLIC ACCOUNTS
FIRST-CLASS WRANGLE
THE Commonwealth Treasury has
always frowned on the natural
tendency of a Commonwealth Depart-
ment to try to spend at the last
minute all the money it was voted
at the beginning of the financial year.
Departments know that this is likely
to make the Treasury sceptical about
their future estimates (with the likeli-
hood they won’t get as much next
time), and that a Department might
have to go through the torture of
self-criticism before a meeting of the
Parliamentary Public Accounts Com-
mittee.
Last week, the Public Accounts
Committee dealt with a Department
which varied its contract conditions
so that in the final week of the year
it could make part payments to
suppliers, and thus spend all the money
available under a particular vote of
the Parliament. But the case had
an added attraction: it revealed a
first-class wrangle between three
Commonwealth organisations.
One often knows of squabbles be-
tween Departments or with the Public
Service Board. But it’s not often that
the fight is made quite so public,
and the subject of open evidence, as
it has been with the Department of
Civil Aviation versus the Treasury
and the Auditor General’s Office.
The Department of Civil Aviation,
when drawing up its estimate under
Appropriation Act No. 2 for 1967-68,
planned to spend $2.2 million under
a category covering aircraft, launches,
vehicles, engines, and equipment. By
the end of 1967-68 the Department
had spent only about $l.B million of
the original vote leaving $391,000
unspent.
The Public Accounts Committee
wanted to know why.
The Departmeftt explained that
deliveries on some contracts were not
made before the end of the financial
year. It had followed the practice, when
equipment was being manufactured
toward the end of the year, of making
a part payment, usually after the
dispatch of the item from the factory,
but before actual delivery to the Depart-
ment. The Commonwealth was indem-
nified against loss or non-completion of
the contract by the supplier. The Com-
monwealth had never suffered financially
through this practice. However, the
Auditor-General’s office found out about
it sometime during 1967-68 and ques-
tioned whether the Department should
carry on its business in this way.
When the Department refused to
accept that it was acting wrongly, the
Audit Office then enlisted the support
of the Treasury, which also ruled
against the Department, and the
Department was forced to give in
at least temporarily. Because it could


not follow old habits, the Department
ended 1967-68 with $391,000 unspent
in this one category.
Mr. B. Lewis, the First Assistant
Director-General (Management Ser-
vices) of the Department, appeared
before the Committee in the hope that
it would be a successful court of
appeal. “I hope we used common-
sense,” he said. “The Commonwealth
has not been the loser in what we
did. Until 1967-68 we behaved in a
sensible way. We were circumscribed
by the comments which the Audit
Office made. In the light of them
we were in a quandary. Here was
an instruction from the Audit Office
that we should not continue with this
type of thing. It was supported by
Treasury. Frankly, we welcome the
opportunity to come here to tell you
what we did.”
Mr. Lewis’ argument to the Com-
mittee amounted to the fact that
Treasury, rightly or wrongly, never
gave the Department all the money
which it felt it should have to carry
out civil aviation development pro-
grams. If there was a carryover of
money from one year to the next,
the program for the following year
would be reduced by about the
amount which was unspent in the
previous year. Cumulatively, this
would mean the Department would
get one program behind every
seven years.
The Audit Office observer on the
Committee, Mr. Raglass, was quick
to the point of the objection: “It is
our attitude that these payments were
made for the express purpose of
utilising available funds.” And the
Treasury’s observer on the Committee,
Mr. M. G. Cowie, said the Treasury
had had experience of progress pay-
ments which had been made merely
to use up a particular appropriation.
Changing a contract’s conditions
merely to make progress payments
seemed, in the Treasury’s view, to
be wrong in principle. The Depart-
ment of Civil Aviation’s practice had
not given any financial advantage to
the Commonwealth, and it could be
said that the Commonwealth had been
at a disadvantage because it had
spent money before it was legally
required to do so. Mr. Lewis reiterated
the point that DCA would not auto-
matically get in the following year
the amount underspent in- the pre-
vious ,year.
The debate between the three men
went on for some time. Mr. Raglass
made clear that his office did not want
this type of practice to become wide-
spread in the Public Service, and that
a great deal of control would be needed
to ensure against loss if it was extended
to other Departments. But DCA,
through this part of the argument,
failed to emphasise the point that
they were not rushing into quick
and urgent orders in the final
month of the year just to spend
their money. The goods they were
buying, under contract, had been
ordered many weeks before the end of
the year, and formed part of a planned
program. They did make the point that
the part-payments avoided the large
carryover and ensured the more efficient
development of civil aviation. And out
of all this argument did ' come the
DCA Secretary Sir Donald Anderson
admission from Mr. Raglass that he had
never thought the motivation of the
Department was anything but honest
and frank.
But it seems that the lucky firms who
were able to get an unsolicited, early
payment from DC.A will have to look
back on those once-happy days unless
the Committee, in its report to Parlia-
ment later on, decides that DCA was
right after all.
EDUCATION
RAISING THE SIGHTS
IF THE PHRASE “cultural impover-
ishment” has the ring of sociologese
jargon to the literate, it has a depress-
ingly precise meaning to the teaching of
the non-literate. The phrase has been
bandied about in Melbourne recently
in two different, but closely related
contexts. The first has been the launch-
ing of a campaign by the Victorian
Technical Teachers’ Associations to
combat the inadequate literacy of “two
out of every three” technical school-
children, while the second represents,
perhaps, Australia’s most dramatic
experiment in education for two
decades.
Departmental approval has been
given for the construction of a new
Collingwood High School, which, if all
goes according to plan, will be a school
and community centre in one. Co-edu-
cational, it will replace the dilapidated
Girls’ High School and will be built
around the idea of the school as an
integrating and improving social force
in the community.
Thinly disguised as tough “Carring-
bush” in Frank Hardy’s “Power With-
out Glory,” Collingwood, with its heavy
concentration of Greek and Italian
immigrants, is now undergoing a slum
clearance program which has gradually
substituted the new problems of high-
density population for the old social
problems caused by sub-standard
housing.
It is in this environment of Housing
Commission towers and four-storey flat
blocks that the planners wish to build
what may be called the “Collingwood
Educational Centre.” The parent-
teacher-sociologist team, which worked
on the plan for 11 months before sub-
mitting the final report to the Minister
of Education, Mr. Thompson, in mid-
August, hopes to have designed a school
and an approach to education that will
both dovetail with local needs and find
strong community support.
The chairman of the group (the “Col-
lingwood High School Proposal Com-
mittee”), engineer Mr. R. Kitchenn,
believes the concept will combat atti-
tudes like “school is special,” “school is
hard,” “school’s a place to send them
until they go to work.” He says, “To
put it simply, we want to raise the
sights of the parents.”
This concept first took shape nearly
a year ago, during a seminar on the
problems of inner suburban schools
held by the Victorian Council of
Schools’ Organisations at the Colling-
wood Town Hall. Floating ideas, pro-
duced by a campaign of the Victorian
Teachers’ Union held a short time
before, crystallised around Colling-
wood’s particularly urgent need for
better schools.
Impressed by the idea, and sensing
the political utility of having organised
local support behind it, Mr. Ron Reed,
director of secondary education, pro-
vided an executive officer and depart-
mental research facilities for the com-
mittee.
With the Council of Schools’ Organ-
isations providing leadership, the Com-
mittee has drawn on social scientists,
architects, town planners, local residents,
a variety of educationists, and even
schoolchildren to map out the idea of
the school. Although the architectural
details of the multi-storey building have
not been finalised, it will probably
include: language laboratories, . a
coffee lounge, a theatre, a branch of
the municipal library, rooms for social
workers, a gymnasium, and rooms for
adult education classes.
The language laboratories will double
for teaching immigrant'children correct
English and for teaching European and
Asian languages to Australians. Original
plans anticipated the completion of
building by 1970, but Mr. Kitchenn
thinks they may have been too opti-
mistic about that date.
Proposals to take the school out of
the area to give senior students space
to spread themselves physically, and
enjoy fresh perspectives of trees, hills,
and the city skyline, were debated, but
eventually shelved. It is thought by
the majority that, beneficial as the
idea would be, it would defeat the main
purpose of the project: the direct
involvement of parents in the educa-
tional process. Most think only actual
proximity can do this. Negotiations are
proceeding with the Collingwood
Council to find a suitable site.

INTERNATIONAL
WHY THE
RUSSIANS
DID IT
WITH A FLICK of their finger the
Russians have knocked aside one of the
two main beliefs on which the Western
world’s relationship with them has been
based throughout the 19605. Not by the
actual decision to punch their way into
Prague. For years every Western gov-
ernment has silently accepted the fact
that Czechoslovakia is part of the Soviet
Union’s sphere of influence, and that,
if the Russians choose to assert their
authority over any of the East European
countries, the Western world does not
have the military strength to stop them.
Tfye real revelation last week was the
ground on which the Russians decided
to send the tanks in.
The attempt to work out a new rela-
tionship between the Western world and
Russia has rested on the belief that, if
the West accepted the post-1945 division
of Europe, the Russians would run their
half of Europe on a tolerably loose rein.
The small countries of eastern Europe,
with the possible exception of East
Germany, would be allowed a certain
latitude in the way they organised their
affairs so long as they stayed in the
Russian alliance and stuck to the essen-
tials of the Communist system. It is
this belief that has now been smashed.
The Czechs thought they had given the
necessary assurances at their confronta-
tion with the Russians at Cierna last
month. They were wrong. It is not
enough that they were willing to stay
broadly within the system. It turns out
that they must run their country exactly
as the Russians say.
It does not mean that we are back
to the cold war: not quite. The im-
provement that has taken place in
East-West relations since Mr. Khrush-
chev’s trip to America in 1959, and
has lasted through two changes
of government in Washington and one
in Moscow, rests upon a second
premise as well. This is the recognition
by the two super-powers that because
they possess the power of mutual
destruction they must at least try to
make sure that they do not get drawn
into a fight with each other. This
common interest remains, no matter
how the Russians have behaved in
Czechoslovakia. It is why the super-
powers are trying to stop the growth
of nuclear armories,. both their own
and other peoples’. It is also the very
good reason why they want to regulate
the quarrels between their friends
and allies in sensitive parts of the
world like Germany and the Middle
East, so that they will not get dragged
into a war someone else began.
This shared interest in preserving
their own skins, which is at least
half of the reason why relations be-
tween Russia and America have im-
proved in the 19605, will not vanish
because the Russians have behaved
like thugs in Czechoslovakia. And the
rest of us benefit from the super-
powers’ attempt to create some kind
of order in the world. That is why it
is unlikely that the clock has been
turned all the way back to the cold
war of Stalin’s time or of
Khrushchev’s first years in the Kremlin.
But that is not much consolation. The
invasion of Czechoslovakia will have
very important consequences, both
inside Russia and in the attitude toward
Russia of anybody who lives under a
relatively free political system.
Ever since the test ban treaty of
1963, which was the turning point
between the old cold war and the
period of co-operation that followed,
the Governments of President Kennedy
and President Johnson have followed a
consistent policy toward the Soviet
Union. The Americans have tried to
define the rules of “co-existence” a
word the Russians themselves invented
by getting the Russians to agree
.that the world should be divided into
two main spheres of influence, and that
neither side should do any ideological
poaching across the dividing line
between the two spheres. The division
is not meant to cover the whole of
the world: probably neither side would
kick if the other picked up a couple
of Statelets in black Africa. But in the
areas that really matter to both Russia
and America which means central
Europe, the Middle East, and the
Asian underbelly of China the
present division between the Commun-
ist and non-Communist worlds should
be allowed to stand. It is a rough-and-

CONFRONTATION. First at Cierna

FALSE VICTORY? The Czechs
thought Bratislava had secured for them
the right of self-determination
ready rule, but it does give the world
the chance of a bit of peace and calm
while the two great power-systems get
on with the business of seeing which
of them is better at producing the sort
of society people want to live in. And,
up to a point, it has worked. The
Americans stuck to the rules in Hun-
gary in 1956, when there was a real
possibility of a Communist, country
trying to de-Communise itself. So did
the Russians in France this May, when
the French Communist Party was per-
suaded to resist the temptation to con-
vert the general strike into a seizure
of power. The one great exception has
been Vietnam. That is why the Viet-
namese War has gone on so long.
The trouble is that an agreement to
divide a large part of the world into
spheres of influence is never going to
work, unless it is backed up by an
understanding about what happens
inside each of the two spheres. If
people are to accept the idea that their
future lies within one system rather
than the other and the hope of
avoiding a world war depends on many
of them doing just that they must
have reason to hope that they will
have a certain range of political choice
within that system. In most Western
countries, though not all of theta, that
is not the problem. But the invasion
of Czechoslovakia shows that Russia is
not prepared to allow the same degree
of freedom to the nations in its sphere
of influence. That is the difference
between the American interventions in
the Dominican Republic and Vietnam
and what the Russians did to the
Czechs last week. The Americans sent
their troops in to stop armed rebellions
taking those two countries out of the
non-Communist camp into the Com-
taunist one. They have not tried to
specify exactly what sort of govern-
ment, and even which men, should
run them. The Russians invaded
Czechoslovakia in order to put one
group of Czech Communists in place
of another group, even though the
latter came to office legally, peacefully,
and with the support of the majority
of the Czech people. They are not
going to allow the Czechs any choice
at all. It is a mark of their own
insecurity and of their arrogance toward
the rights of their allies.
This is bound to have an effect on
public support for the sort of policy
that John Kennedy and Lyndon John-
son have tried to follow toward the
Russians. It has also improved Mr.
Nixon’s chances of beating any Demo-
crat in November. Mr. Humphrey, like
Mr. Johnson, has taught the Americans
to believe that the Communist world is
not a single monolithic conspiracy, and
that it may be possible to do business
with the Russians even if it is not
possible to do business with the Chinese.
It is probably still true; but it is not a
proposition that the Russians have made
it easier for Americans to believe after
last week. Many of them will turn
back to the undifferentiated anti-
Communism of the 19505. They will
argue that if they have to deal with an
intransigent Russia as well as an intran-
sigent China, they will need more guns
on their side. If that means a bigger
American Army—and perhaps a bigger
German Army, too so be it. If it
means scrapping Mr. McNamara’s
belief that it is not even worth while
trying to achieve a decisive nuclear
superiority over Russia, they may scrap
it. It will be a pity if American opinion
swings this way. The changes that have
taken place in Russian society in the
past 15 years still make it worth hoping
that last week’s decision is an aberra-
tion. But the Russians must recognise
that they have made it much harder
for the next American President to con-
tinue Mr. Johnson’s policy toward them.
What they have done, in fact, is to
make many people in America and
elsewhere question the West’s accept-
ance of the whole concept of co-
existence. This is the third time in most
people’s lifetimes that Czechoslovakia
has been occupied by one of its big
neighbors, and its popular efforts to run
a liberal Western domocracy, or a
liberalised socialist democracy, stamped
out. Not in 1938, not in 1948, and least
of all now in 1968 have the Western
governments and people lifted a finger
to help it. There was a word for this
in 1938: it was called appeasement. It
can be applied now. The comfortable,
defensive West did not move a man or
a gun in central Europe to deter the
militarists in Russia, or even make them
think twice, before they marched in.
The Western countries did not take
the issue to the United Nations when
the Russian troops were in Czecho-
slovakia a month ago. That would at
least have developed the political con-
frontation on the world stage, and not
behind closed doors at Cierna and
Bratislava. If they did not like the U.N.,
they could have made a public speech
or two. Would it have strengthened
the Russian moderates’ hand to be able
to remind the militarists that the in-
vasion would have to be justified be-
fore world opinion? That, indeed, com-
mitments might have to be made to
stop the clamor? It would certainly not
have weakened the taoderates. And
there can be no doubt that if the boot
had been in any remote way on the
other foot even responsible moderate
Mr. Kosygin would have been bringing
pressure on the West in any way he
could. The Western world has been
sticking to its idea of the under-
standing voluntarily. The Russians,
except when someone stands up to
them, do not.
The question has to be put. Is the
division of Europe into spheres of in-
terest —built up, painfully and some-
times haphazardly, since the first terri-
torial settlements at Yalta—worth pre-
serving? Who ought to be morally, in-
tellectually, and economically on the
offensive there? Is it really part of
Western business to try for better rela-
tions with men like East Germany’s
Ulbricht —and keep them in power in
so doing? The least the West can do
now is put the trade, cultural, tourist,
and every other screw on all those East
European countries that played the
jackal’s part last week—and not smile
on them again until it suits the Western
book. The same should be done to
Russia’s leaders. Let them learn, from
outsiders for a change, what it is like
to be one of Pavlov’s dogs.
One immediate effect of this will
be on the internal politics of the
Western Alliance. NATO has been
given a new lease of life. It is now
far less likely than it was that 1969,
the year when member States can
announce their withdrawal, will see
two or three more NATO countries
following France’s example and
stomping out. Some of the biggest
anti-Russian demonstrations last week
were in Denmark and Holland, two
countries where the idea of leaving

NATO has been fairly popular. It
will be less popular now. The Ger-

non-proliferation treaty turns out to be
one of the few things on which the
Americans and the Russians can con-
tinue to collaborate in the next few
years. The Germans’ affection for the
United States is in direct proportion to
the bloody-mindedness the Russians
show in Eastern Europe. It is the NATO
loyalists in Europe who are going to
be saying we-told-you-so. It is the
opponents of American leadership, like
President de Gaulle, who will fall
back into uncomfortable silence.
The temptation to neutralism in
Western Europe grows when the Soviet
Union is relaxed at home and quiet
in its foreign policy. It vanishes when
Russia exports repression. Whatever
else the Russians have achieved by
their action in Czechoslovakia, they
have successfully halted the growth
of the anti-American feeling that has
been spreading through parts of
Western Europe since 1966. The pro-
fessional demonstrators, to their credit,
now have turned their attention to
Russian targets. But these people, like
President de Gaulle, have lost
their claim to a politically tenable
position. You can demonstrate against
one super Power, and carry quite a lot
of people with you. If you demonstrate
against both of them at the same time,
most people will think you are just
doing if for the fun. The hard
political fact the critics of America
ran up against last week was that,
if Russia is run by men who do this
sort of thing, the United States is, for
all its faults, incomparably the more
civilised of the super Powers; it is the
only real source of protection for the
rest of us against such Russian leaders;
and it is justified in opposing the
expansion of Communist power.
That is probably the conclusion many
people of the moderate centre will
draw. It will show itself in their attitude
toward the Vietnam War. The honest
critics of the American intervention
must admit that there is a major dif-
ference between the purpose for which
the Americans went into Vietnam and
the purpose for which the Russians
invaded Czechoslovakia. They will be
more reluctant to let South Vietnam
pass under Communist control now that
last week’s events have shown how even
the supposedly more moderate sort of
Communists propose to deal with
people under their authority. The Right-
wingers, of course, will simply say that
all Communists are the same and there
is no point in negotiating with any of
them. It is not true, or not quite. But
the Russians have certainly destroyed
their own claim that they can mediate
between the Americans and the North
Vietnamese. If they really do carry
any weight in Hanoi—and there has
never been much evidence of it—it is
hard to see how it can now be used to
promote a settlement of the war. The
probable result is that American
opinion will harden against a disguised
surrender in Vietnam; and that this
hardening will receive much less
criticism from America’s allies than
it would have done before last week.
But if the hopes of East-West co-
operation have been put back several
years, so perhaps has the development
of Russia itself. For last week’s invasion
was as much a defeat for the moderates
a,mong Russia’s leaders as it was for the
reformers in Prague. Mr. Kosygin, and
the others who wanted to haul Russia
into the second half of the 20th century,
may hold on to their jobs: they went
along with last week’s decision, after
all. But they lost the argument. It is
the other lot who are likely to make the
running now. Having established their
control over by presidium in the matter
of the Czechs, they will presumably
assert themselves in other things as well.
The jamming of Western broadcasts has
already begun all oyer again. The men
who are trying to liberalise the econo.my
have already been told that they have
gone as far as they will be allowed to.
The controls on intellectuals may be
tightened even more than they already
have been this year: the men who used
the sword on Czechoslovakia are not
going to risk being stabbed in the back
by a Russian pen. Hard-liners, who were
eased out of positions of power last
year, may be brought back again now.
For many of the men at the top of the
Russian Communist Party, after all, a
return to the former style of politics
would be very cosy indeed. In Russia,
as in the West, many old politicians
look back on the cold war with some-
thing approaching nostalgia.
But a return to the old days would
cause enormous problems for those
whose job it is to run that vast and
torpid country. This is what makes it
reasonable to hope that the moderates
will reassert themselves. A return to
the politics of repression means cutting
off Russia’s scientists and managers
or all but the most barrenly docile of
them from their contacts with the
enormously more successful economies
of the West. It would mean raising a
new generation of intellectual hacks.
It would also mean re-establishing a
police apparatus at least as strong as
Stalin’s, because the Russians would
have to be whipped back from the
very modest degree of personal liberty
they have become accustomed to since
Stalin’s time. It could happen; it is
not much more inconceivable than the
Russians using German troops to in-
vade Czechoslovakia. And any Russian
scientist or manager who swallows that
will swallow anything.
But it will happen only if Russia’s
leaders are prepared to watch their
country’s economy, and its intellectual
life, descend to the quality of a
Eurasian backwater. If the present
leaders of Communist Europe pursue
these policies in order to maintain their
own power, they will have confessed
that the internal conflicts of Commun-
ism can be resolved only by either com-
plete repression or complete explosion.
The Russians are a people of character.
They produce, even in the ranks of
their Communist Party, men of sensi-
bility and intellectual self-respect. It is
unlikely that such a people will resign
themselves to so sterile a confession of
failure.
Of course, it is appeasement to say
that Eastern Europe’s only hope of
escaping another generation of repres-
sion and debasement is that the better
educated and more internationally
minded society that has developed in
Russia since Stalin’s death will not
stomach it. But it is also true. Until
the Russian people show that they are
prepared to resign themselves to
another generation of darkness, the hope
will remain that the invasion of
Czechoslovakia was the final fling of
the old politics of Communism.

AUSTRALIA’S LEADING PERMANENT BUILDING SOCIETY
INVASION
THE DAY A RADIO
STATION RAN A NATION
WEDNESDAY, August 21, was the
day when Czech radio and TV
announcers, and the tireless men of
the national news agency (CTK), vir-
tually ran Czechoslovakia. After
Dubcek and his progressive lieutenants
had been seized by Russian officers in
the Com’munist Party Central Commit-
tee building, the communicators took
charge. They fed not only news but
ideas for action to their own rulers
and people. They also kept up a
constant supply of information to such
foreign newspaper reporters as found
themselves in Prague.
The Czech radio and agency men
kept going in evident defiance of the
Russian troops. Everything they put
out was pro-Dubcek. The occupying
army found itself obliged to open up
its own counter-propaganda radio
station. Sometimes it appeared that
Russian paratroops were actually on
the Czech radio premises yet the
broadcasts went on.
The announcers’ bravery sounded
nonchalant, their expertise was stag-
gering. The story they gave minute by
minute was often confusing, so’metimes
contradictory. But it never seemed as
if anyone was trying to hide anything.
For men with only limited and recent
experience in the proper handling of
freedom, it was a marvellous perform-
ance.
They were least effective in their
countrywide coverage of the invasion
itself, naturally enough. The CTK men
seemed to be active only in Prague.
And although “free” radio stations
kept operating intermittently all day
in several towns many miles apart, the
news-gathering range of each was
often limited to what could be seen
out of the studio window.
It was at 0200 hours that Prague
Radio, speaking in the name of Presi-
dent Svoboda, came on the air to
announce that Russian troops, with
their satellite allies, had crossed the
Czech borders without warning.
Military resistance would have been
suicidal. Not only were the Czechs out-
numbered by eight to one but the 14
Czech divisions were mainly deployed
against attack from the west (as laid
down by Warsaw Pact planning). To
have redeployed the divisions at any
time in the past few weeks would have
lent apparent substance to Soviet
charges that the Czech leaders had
“sold out to NATO.” So Prague Radio
took over the struggle.
From the start it was not content
simply to give the news. It took over
the direction of affairs.
So, before dawn, it began calling on
the workers to rouse the rest of the
people. “We ask you to spread the
word as quickly as possible,” the
announcer said. Those who were awake
began telephoning those who slept.
People ran out into the cold of the
misty streets of the capital, some in
their dressing gowns. And young men
began racing round the empty streets
in cars and taxis, with klaxons blaring,
passengers hanging out of the windows
under cracking Czech flags and shouting,
“They’ve come! They’ve come!”
But from the word go, the country’s
radio rulers seemed bent on keeping
the people calm, especially when heavy
Soviet planes began trundling in over
the city itself to discharge troops and
tanks at the airport, six miles out.
The aim was patently to organise
non-violent resistance. Operating on the
eve of the Gandhi centenary year, the
stations seemed to be trying for the
first time in history to promote a
vast non-violent answer to a massive
armed assault from abroad.
Soon after 2 a.m. Prague Radio was
telling the country that the Czech Army
of 75,000 men, and the People’s Militia,
would not offer armed resistance to the
invaders. Dignified calm was what the
announcer was calling for when, at
about 5 a.m., Soviet tanks' and troop-
carriers began rumbling up the steep
tram-laden street leading to, the radio
building, and surrounded it.
But in some way or another, Prague
Radio kept going. The day’s messages
never quite made it clear whether or
not the radio building was taken over
by Russian troops, though one CTK re-
port mentioned Soviet paratroops with
automatic weapons using the seats in
the foyer normally filled by elderly
commissionaires dressed like retired
tram-drivers.
But wherever the words were com-
ing from Prague Radio was soon back
on the air plugging the passive resist-
ance theme. “Don’t acknowledge these
invaders,” it said. “Don’t give them any
pretext for armed attack. You’re still
listening to the voice of Free Prague.
Trust us. Tell the soldiers there was
peace and quiet here until they came.
Let us do everything so that they will
leave soon.”
This probably helps to explain the
strange character of those first en-
counters between the Czechs crowding
the streets and the intrusive Russian
soldiers. The young Czechs seem at first
to have tried to “shame” the invaders
in the Gandhian tradition with
rational, though outraged, argument.
They evidently managed to embarrass
some of the younger Russians, one of
who,m was reported by CTK as mumbl-
ing, incredibly, that he thought he was
in West Germany.
But, as some of the Czechs got car-
ried away by patriotic emotion, things
took a menacing turn outside the radio
building. Some of them found a couple
of mobile cranes and drove them up so
that they hemmed in two Russian tanks.
The tanks began butting their way out
and machine-guns were fired, appar-
ently into the air.
At once Prague Radio which still
must have been close enough actually to
see what was going on began repeat-
ing its appeal for calm, speaking
directly to those in the streets who had
transistors clamped to their ears. “Don’t
provoke these people,” the announcer

A noise switch is only a little item . . .
but pretty important to the record en-

with surface noises filed away in his

With a 3-piece hi-fi module unit as
finely engineered as the Sanyo

noises could be a problem, but this
efficient little switch cuts them out
completely. No other comparable im-

pleaded. “There’s nothing you can do
At 0235 that’s to say, long be-
fore it could have known this was so
Prague Radio announced that Gov-
ernment and Communist Party officials
were remaining at their posts. It was, in
effect, advising them to proceed there.
After that, it seemed to keep in re-
markably close touch with such
authorities as had not been interned,
presumably with gallant aid from the
reporters of CTK.
And then in the evening came
another major coup for Prague Radio
and its helpers, when it gave out the
official reasons why the Czech Army
had put up no resistance. The Army
Command itself was quoted as saying
this had been done on President
Svoboda’s orders and that his were
the only orders the Army would obey.
And the Defence Minister in person
was quoted as a philosophical adherent
of non-violence. “This stand taken by
the Government of Czechoslovakia in
face of the forceful occupation of the
country,” he said, “will be appreciated
by history as a contribution by a small
country to the safeguarding of inter-
national peace.”
Even Czech TV kept going spas-
“modically. It also managed to smuggle
out, across the Austrian frontier, some
of the film seen throughout the world
an unexplained jumble, but surely
unique as a leak from Russian-held
territory.
The CTK reporters evidently kept
roaming the thronged and turbulent
streets throughout the day. They were
the ones who found eye-witnesses to
say that Dubcek and his closest aides
had been taken away by the usual
“men in raincoats” or bundled into
Soviet cars to unknown places. They
also discovered that the Mayor of
Prague was a prisoner in his own Town
Hall in the square of the old city,
where a splendid memorial recalls the
nation’s Hussite-founding martyrs, and
where Kafka’s father once had a small
shop.
But at 2352 hours the end seemed
to come from CTK. Their tickers clat-
tered, saying: “The Czechoslovakian
News Agency has just been occupied by
foreign troops. At this moment the free
news activity of CTK is ending. If
further news is transmitted it will no
longer be from the . . .” And there the
clattering stopped.
CZECH RESISTANCE
A NEW WEAPON?
IT NOW SEEMS clear that in the
Czech resistance to the Russians we
have seen the test of an unorthodox
idea called “civilian defence,” which
is advocated by some experts as an
effective alternative to defence by
arms.
For the strategy to succeed (the
criterion is that it must force the
aggressor to relinquish his hold on
the country) a comprehensive plan
must be prepared in advance. Reports
of the Czech resistance last week
s ugg es t that, for the first time in
history, such a plan may have been
prepared in advance.
The activities of the free radio
stations could scarcely have been
possible without elaborate preparation
to conceal them. The holding of an
extraordinary Congress of the Czech
Communist Party the day after the
invasion to repudiate, in advance, the
creation of a puppet government
favorable to Russia also suggests some
contingency planning.
The theorists of civilian defence
have always argued that such tactics
as these can only have a temporary
effect. The long-term objective is to
deny to the enemy the civil apparatus
needed to administer an occupied
country, which requires the help of the
people themselves. The difficulty is
that strikes and administrative chaos
■may subject the people to insupport-
able privation long before shaking the
will of the occupying power. Success
also depends on the readiness of the
civilian population to accept the

increasing brutalities to which the

But last week the Czechs remained

the strategy of defence has received a
new dimension perhaps more effec-
tive than the deterrent threat of the

lfty members of the Communist
arty Central Committee met in the
Hotel Prague, traditionally the preserve
of the top brass, to discuss the crisis.
Soon after the meeting began, the
hotel was encircled by Russian tanks
a melodramatic gesture of intimidation
and a posse of senior Russian officers
entered at gunpoint accompanied by
several Right-wingers: Bilak, Kolder,
Indra, and Barbirek. These men
appealed to the others to collaborate.
After several hours of anguished debate,
they failed. The committee passed a
resolution backing the legal govern-
ment -
Thursday was the day on which the
Czechs fought back with their amaz-
ing new weapon. A group of Czech
Army officers held a meeting and
solemnly demanded that the country
should withdraw from the Warsaw
Pact if the occupation forces did not
leave within 24 hours. The Prosecutor-
General of the Czech Army instructed
troops to take orders only from their
own superiors. Surrendering their arms
would be punishable as treason. Corn-
munists on the General Staff demanded
that Mr. Dubcek and the captive lead-
ers should be allowed to join in the
Party Congress.
More than 150 deputies inside the
National Assembly building defiantly
proclaimed themselves for Svoboda and
Dubcek. And at the remarkable meet-
ing of the Party Congress inside the
huge CKD plant in Prague the vote
was 1094-1 in favor of the legal gov-
ernment.
The free radio called on wireless
hams to jam Russian military signals,
Colonel Emil Zatopek, the former
athlete, addressed the crowd upder the
muzzles of Soviet cannon and called for
Russia to be banned from the Olympic
Games. Tables appeared once again out-
side public buildings, and people queued
to sign petitions calling for the release
of the imprisoned leaders,
As Thursday drew to a close, Pav-
lovsky issued an exasperated ultimatum:
either form a new government without
Dubcek or we will form one for you.
Friday’s story began before dawn
with "a startling message sent by telex
from an airline office in Prague to the
BBC in London. It said that the Rus-
sjans were preparing to remove an
unwilling President Svoboda to Mos-
cow. But a f evv h ours later the elderly
President’s own grave voice was heard
over Free Czech Radio saying that the
Moscow trip was his own idea,
Apparently, the night before, in
p rague Castle, the Russian occupation
commander, General Pavlovsky, had
handed him a list of names for a new
puppet government of Czechoslovakia
and asked for his signature. The Presi-
dent had refused to sign, had asked in-
stead for direct negotiations with “the
highest representatives of the Soviet
Union” in Moscow, and the General, it
seems, had agreed.
None of the messages from Prague


explained how the President managed
to get himself broadcast by one of the
few remaining clandestine stations. For
his first broadcast message to the nation,
put out on Wednesday, the suggestion
was that he had made a tape-recording
and this had been smuggled to the
hidden microphones.
The people seemed happy in the
knowledge that they still had a gov-
ernment of sorts, holding the fort of
freedom during Svoboda’s absence in
Moscow, until the hoped-for reappear-
ance of their hero, Dubcek, and his
aides, who had vanished on Wednesday.
This “government” was formed by
the 14th Party Congress of the Czecho-
slovakian Communists, which let it be
known over the free radio that it was
in permanent session, secretly, in one
of Prague’s factories. A new Central
Committee, with Dubcek at its head,
had been elected the night before.
A secret Prague radio the obvious
offspring of those heroes who hung on
for so long in the capital’s radio build-
ing went on acting as the voice of
the people. It began identifying specific
collaborators among the city’s security
police the “raincoat men” who had
earlier arrested the liberal leaders.
It now seemed as if the citizens
having made their turbulent protests
against the invasion were now
building up an atmosphere of dignified
calm in readiness for Friday’s general
strike one hour of total stoppage
from noon onwards.
At noon, factory sirens sounded and
church bells tolled to announce the
strike. Traffic came to a halt when
the strike started. A devoted Reuters
reporter, driving round to check the
public response, was stopped by in-
dignant citizens and, while he was
explaining who he was, someone let
the air out of his tyres.
Later the non-violent rejection of
the occupation continued along its
placid course. Czech women went
about the streets with rolls of ribbon
in red, white, and blue the
national colors snipping bits off
and handing them around for people
to wear in their lapels. Many of those
who took them went home and added
their own snippet of black.
In the afternoon, the new Central
Committee put out a calm broadcast
saying they would be ready to resume
normal relations with the Soviet Union
and the Warsaw Pact once the
invading troops had gone home.
By then the Russians had learned it
was not going to be as easy as it had
looked.
WORLD COMMUNISM
LOSING A WORLD
WE DO NOT even know if the Soviet
Union has won a battle. But we do
know, whatever happens, that the Soviet
Union is losing a world.
From now on, the Soviet Union ceases
to be the leader of world Communism
in any effective sense. The passionate,
stumbling march of millions of people
across the earth toward justice goes on,
through revolution here and through
solemn parliamentary succession there.
But the Soviet Union remains behind,
leader now only of a humilitated and
embittered corner of Europe which
seems, today, to have nothing much Jo
offer the human race.
In Siberia or the Ukraine, in Poland
or Hungary or East Germany, the faith-
ful remnant of decent Socialists switch
off the radio and turn their faces to the
wall. They, and those like them in the
outside world, now endure a bereave-
ment of hope so awful that it unites
them with the suffering Czechs and
Slovaks themselves.
A glance back to 1956 shows that,
as a political event, the Czechoslovak
crisis is a much broader earthquake.
When Hungary threw off Matyas
Rakosi’s Stalinism, only a few months
had gone by since Mr. Khrushchev’s ex-
posure of Stalin at the 20th Party
Congress in Moscow.
“Revisionism” the theory of a
democratic Communism respecting
human rights and the individual
had hardly begun to affect the rank
and file of the Communist movement.
Loyalty to Communism, East and
West, was still very much a defensive
all-or-nothing affair. When the Soviet
Union intervened in Hungary, almost
every Communist Party stood auto-
matically by Moscow, though in the
West tens of thousands broke abruptly
with the Party and tore up their
cards.
The scene today is utterly different.
The end of Stalinism, the great schism
of China, and the new economic
systems in Eastern Europe have moved
Marxist Socialism on into a new age.
The difference is not merely that
almost every Communist Party out-
side Eastern Europe considers the
Soviet intervention in Czechoslovakia
as a blunder or worse. It is the
revelation that the Soviet Union is
hopelessly trapped. Prisoner of its
own fears, the Soviet leadership can
neither keep pace with history nor
deal creatively with the problems
which desperately need to be solved.
From the unchallenged leader of a
movement and an alliance, the Soviet
Union has itself become the problem
child of world Communism.
It doesn’t look as if there will be a
mass exodus from the Communist
Parties in 1968. It is obvious this time
to everyone, including many liberals and
conservatives, that it is not. “Commun-
ism” which has raped Czechoslovakia.
It is a single Communist Party that
of the Soviet Union whose unsolved
contradictions, shelved difficulties, and
aljnost hysterical paralysis in the face of
change have shoved it into an act of
panic.
The two major Western Parties, the
French and the Italians, have con-
demned the Soviet action. They in par-
ticular had placed the highest hopes in
Czechoslovakia, and that years before
Mr. Dubcek came to power. Czecho-
slovakia was the only highly industrial-
ised “Western” State which passed
under Communist control. Here could be
the showpiece, the living proof that a
Communist economy could bring home
the goods in material terms at a level
equal to Western capitalist prosperity.
As the economic reform in Czecho-
slovakia began to create intense political
pressure demonstrating that only a
democratic society could make such
reforms work these parties gave their
political blessing as well to the changes,
until they reached the point of endors-
ing the “action program” set out earlier
this year by the Dubcek leadership.
Most of the other “outside” Parties
THE LOSERS. These are the Russians
who failed to talk the Czechs into line
at Cierna last month and last week
decided to try with tanks instead. What-
ever happens, they have lost the leader-
ship of the Communist world
shared their point of view. Both the
Japanese and then, unexpectedly, the
Indian Parties gave their support to the
Czechs in the rising conflict with
Moscow. This was immensely import-
ant: Asia was the area in which Soviet
competition with Chinese influence was
at its height. Now the pro-Moscow
Indian Communists have written that
“the solution is not to reimpose con-
trols (in Czechoslovakia) but to remove
the mistakes, deformations, and aberra-
tions. The Japanese Communists told the
Czechs that “we reject in principle any
interference in the internal affairs of
another fraternal Party.”
This does not 'mean that these two
Parties have gone Chinese. The action
last week by the Chinese and Albanians
in declaring the Russian action
“shameless” and comparable to the


Nazi invasion of the Sudetenland is
transparent opportunism. Albania, for
instance, has subjected the “Slovak
revisionist clique around Dubcek” to
frenzied and pauseless abuse.
The real Chinese attitude remains
that there is little to choose between
Mr. Brezhnev and Mr. Dubcek, both
of whom are “revisionist” traitors to
Socialism, plotting to restore a bour-
geois capital order. But the Indians
and Japanese are taking their stand
beside the French and Italians, or even
beside the Rumanians and Yugoslavs.
Supporters of the Soviet view on
Czechoslovakia outside Eastern Europe
are not an impressive bunch. The
clandestine West German Party, largely
under East German control, has
endorsed the Moscow line, but even
there a “liberal” wing has expressed
nervous sympathy for the Czech experi-
"ment. The Greek Communists support
Moscow. The Venezuelan Communist
leader attacked “bourgeois Czecho-
slovakia,” but it is not clear that he
commands his rather muddled col-
leagues. The Party in El Salvador
supports Moscow. The North Viet-
namese do so, too, though whether this
marks the military indebtedness to the
Soviet Union or was merely an unlucky
word spoken in haste is not yet clear.
Economic dependence on Russia may
also-explain Cuba’s sudden approval of
the Soviet action.
What does this mean for the unity
of world Communism? In the first
place, this is not a split or the decisive
breach with Moscow. The Communists
in Western Europe are not now going
to form a separate “church” or treat
Moscow as a powerful ideological ad-
versary. The French Communists, for
instance, are leaning over backward
to make this • clear, warning against
“anti-Communist and anti-Soviet specu-
lations and provocations.” In Britain
the “Morning Star” drops in combative
paragraphs of this kind, too.
Instead, the Western Communists are
coming to regard the Soviet Union as
a brother possessed by a dangerous and
pitiable sickness, who must be rescued
from himself. Even the Czechoslovak
reformers took this view: repeatedly
they would say that “our real problem
is how to help the Soviet leaders who
remain our friends and allies out of
this morass into which they have blun-
dered. It is up to us to find a way out
for them, because, frankly, they are lost
and they could do something stupid.”
The Soviet Union, incredibly, has be-
come “the weaker brethren,” or “the
sick man of Europe.” In this view, the
rigid, repressive form of leadership—
made more nervous and more incom-
petent by the fact that it is carried out
by several mutually suspicious men than
by a single dictator has proved in-
capable of dealing with historical
change in Eastern Europe, let alone of
giving a creative captaincy to the
world Co,mmunist movement.
ASIAN REACTION
OFF, AND ON, FENCES
THAT all our (future) Czechoslovakia*
may well be much nearer home was
indicated by some of the Asian reactions
to the European tragedy. North Korea,
for example, was Russia’s strongest sup-
porter, condemning only the drift to
democratisation and its reasons were
obvious, since the week included more
incidents on the North-South border.
While Singapore neutrality had seen the
welcoming of the North Korean Vice-
President, Kang Ryang Wook, but a
little while ago, Singapore, at the other
end of the scale, maintained that “Even
in this cynical age we are shocked and
dismayed by policies where right is no
more than a display of might.” More
pointedly, the tiny island republic
in a message from Foreign Minister
Rajaratnam to his representative at the
United Nations maintained that
“If this is the basis of co-existence, then
friendship between big and small
nations remains always a hazardous
enterprise.”
While the reactions were generally
predictable, there were ironies and para-
doxes. It was, after all, China alone
which invoked the historical memory
of Hitler’s march into Sudetenland 30
years ago though, of course, the
Chinese were only second to Albania
in being able to condemn both the
Soviet and the Czech revisionists. While
China- condemned, India refused to.
New Delhi’s position at the UN was
substantially no different from Nehru’s
stance over Hungary. All that was dif-
ferent was the even more vociferous
degree of the opposition his daughter
encountered. The other major Asian
Russian-aid receiver likewise abstained
on the Security Council motion, but
Pakistan at least had the grace to
clothe its fence-sitting behind “a failure
to receive instructions in time.”
By contrast, the Japanese Foreign
Ministry abandoned its customary low-
posture fence-sitting. Calling for
immediate and unconditional with-
drawal, it was one of the few Govern-
ments to call a spade a spade, terming
the Russian claim to be acting upon
Czech requests as “completely baseless.”
Needless to say, some used the occa-
sion to restate their old prejudices.
“Top Nationalist Chinese sources”
inevitably wondered if the Russian
action was a sign of possible future
intervention in China so much so as
to make one wonder if Taipei would
now look to Moscow rather than to
Washington to fulfil its dream of “liber-
ating the mainland.” Thailand’s Foreign
Minister, Thanat Khoman, on the other
hand, immediately took the opportunity
to second a favorite theme “totali-
tarian forces have felt encouraged to
launch into adventures because of the
support they have been getting from
the fraudulent liberals of the West.”
North Vietnam lost an opportunity
to stress to the people Thanat had in
mind future possible Titoist tendencies.
Once again, Russian aid being what it
is, Hanoi on this occasion supported
great-power interventionism.
In Australia’s neighborhood, all coun-
tries of the Association of South-East
Asian Nations expressed varying degrees
of concern and displeasure that the
principles on non-intervention and
peaceful co-existence were being so
obviously flouted. The Malaysian Gov-
ernment statement was not so strong
as it would have been in the days when
there was no Russian Embassy, but,
even as the new Ambassador was not
called upon to officially explain, neither
was he asked to officially receive any
token of “deep regret and concern.”
However, making his first speech at
the National Press Club, the Ambassa-
dor bravely, if not too effectively,
defended himself against a hail of ques-
tions on the topic of the hour “the
legitimate Government of Czecho-
slovakia is an internal matter of the
Czech people.”
For once, like their counterparts in
Indonesia, Malaysian students demon-
strated outside the Russian Embassy,
only to be quickly dispersed by a riot
squad seemingly bent upon reminding
that one day they might end up pro-
voking the riots they were formed to
put down.
In short, the slowly gathering momen-
tum of Russia’s diplomatic drive in
South-East Asia would seem to have
suffered a serious setback. None of the
Asian reactions were so crass as that
of one Nigerian official “the invasion
is good for us . . . now secessionist
Biafra will see what has happened to a
smaller country.” Perhaps the reaction
with the most loaded implication for
Australia was Senator McCarthy’s voic-
ing of a widespread American view
“Our involvement in Vietnam is leaving
us without practical moral and diplo-
matic power to be used in other parts
of the world and in other crises.”


New Zealand’s Neddy
sets its targets
By ANTHONY HAAS
“UNLESS significant changes are made
in existing attitudes and policies, the
rate of New Zealand’s economic
growth over the next decade will be
undesirably low, resulting in substan-
tial underemployment of resources and
a slow rise in living standards.” This
is how the Targets Committee of the
National Development Conference
(NDC) began its report to the first
meeting of the NDC, which opened in
Wellington this week.
NDC is the New Zealand version
of the British “Neddy” (National
Economic Development Council) and
France’s Commissariat du Plan (there
is no Australian equivalent). It began
almost by accident when Cabinet was
faced with proposals for sectional con-
ferences like the 1963 Agricultural
Development Conference and decided
that national planning, balancing sec-
tional demands, might now be politi-
cally acceptable.
Its first three-day plenary session
came after four months of hard sec-
tional committee work involving 500
citizens. The Government, guided by
the Treasury, selected conference
members with wide-ranging back-
grounds, and on the Central Targets
Committee, which was the only co'm-
mittee to report to the first plenary
meeting, they tried to select men both
broadly representative and expert.
Chaired by the Governor of the
Reserve Bank, A. R. Low, the Targets
Committee has made a preliminary re-
port, to be discussed first by the NDC
and then by the Government, on desir-
able and practicable growth rates and
their economic implications.
The Targets Committee has recom-
mended a bjg increase in .manufactured
exports. It says an average annual
41 percent economic growth rate is
practicable and desirable. “Present
levels of exports of goods and services
must be nearly doubled in value by
1978-79. While pastoral products will
still form some 70 percent of exports
of goods and services in ten years’ time
(they were 77 percent in 1967-68) the
greatest growth rate must come from
non-traditional exports.”
Their guidelines for export increases
are pastoral 74 percent, horticultural
88 percent, forestry 143 percent,
fisheries 178 percent, other manufac-
turing 445 percent, tourism 178 per-
cent, transportation 129 percent, other
60 percent, representing total increases
of 92 percent and $760 million.
To achieve the increased production
required for local and export needs the
rate of investment in new buildings,
plant, equipment, and stocks must be
nearly doubled by 1978-79. By that year
annual investment will have to be
$935 million higher than in .1967-68.
High levels of new investment must be
accompanied by the more efficient use
(and resulting higher productivity) of
existing resources and the replacement
of imports by locally produced goods
must be continued wherever this can
be done efficiently.
If overseas borrowing is to be kept
within manageable limits, increased
levels of private and public savings will
be essential to provide the finance for
capital expansion. An annual growth
rate of 4J percent will allow a rise in
the real standard of living of approxi-
mately 2\ percent annually up to 1978-
79 compared with an annual average
increase for the past decade of 2 percent.
MALAYSIA
HANGING COMPROMISE
By HARVEY STOCKWIN
THE CURRENT hanging issue which
has been disturbing the normally placid
surface of Malaysian politics was osten-
sibly laid to rest last Saturday. The
formula was an interesting one. The
Mentri Besar (Chief Minister) of
Johore announced that the Sultan of
Johore had commuted to life imprison-
ment the death sentence of the 11
Chinese awaiting execution in Pudu
Jail, in Kuala Lumpur. A statement
signed by the Sultan said, “The decision
was made by His Royal Highness on
the desire and wishes of the Prime
Minister, Tunku Abdul Rahman. With
this His Royal Highness appeals to all
the people to remain calm and to be
together to ensure the continued peace
and harmony of the country.”
The issue having been thus put to
rest, whether it has also been put to
sleep remains to be seen. On the one
hand, it had in any case been allowed
to drag on far too long always a
risky business with an emotional com-
munal issue. On the other hand, the
attitudes aroused by one communal
issue inevitably affect the next issue
that may arise, even as the degree of
compromise arrived at by the Alliance
Government on one occasion inevitably
affects the degree of compromise con-
sidered expedient on the next. For
example, it may well have been that
early Government obduracy on this
hanging question was in part condi-
tioned by earlier compromises on
language and educational issues re-
garded as favoring the non-Malays.
While the need to now placate
Malay sensitivities can be granted, the
sad fact of the matter, of course, is
that there is no guarantee that the
next issue will be decided upon that
basis. While understandable, precon-
ceived attitudes do not necessarily
make for continued peace and har-
mony any more than preconceived
communal prejudices. What is also
needed is a finely tuned intuition to
discern the limits of the possible. Once
again the Tunku has demonstrated
that he has this quality to a much
greater extent than anyone else in
Government or Opposition. Since the
Prime Minister grows no younger, this
is also a cause for concern.
What did work for peace and har-
mony and the quiet ending of the
issue was the fact that while the
Opposition had originally taken advan-
tage of the Alliance dillydallying over
the hanging, in the end it did not. The
Malaysian Parliament was in session last
week and, mercifully, in the event did
not debate the issue. Dr. Tan Chee
Koon tried to adjourn the House of
Representatives on the issue but was
knocked back by the Speaker. Another
Opposition Leader, Seenivasagam, had
got a motion on the order paper but
at the last minute decided to withdraw
it. Obviously any open parliamentary
discussion of the hanging question
would have been rousing and would,
itself, have aroused. The Tunku’s desires
and wishes would have then appeared
a knuckling under to Opposition
demands. But while there was no
public debate there was private discus-
sion, which no doubt made it easier
The Tunku interceded to have the death
sentences on 11 Chinese commuted
for compromise to be effected all round.
Dr. Tan and Seenivasagam have been
fulsome in their compliments to the
Sultan and to the Tunku.
Such attaining of compromise,
albeit belatedly, is one of the happier
aspects of the Malaysian political scene,
though one could wish that more often
it came sooner rather than later. But
in the long run it would seem that a
more open appreciation of communal
differences is necessary. Professor
Ungku Aziz’s call last year after the
Penang riots for an inquiry into the
root causes for communal discord has
so far unhappily met with
non-response.


THE WEEK IN AMERICA
THE ARMS RACE
SUPER-SECRET MIRV
THE Russo-American arms race height-
ened dramatically last week, coincident
with the Czech invasion.
Just as atomic bombs were surpassed
by hydrogen bombs, and bombers were
surpassed by missiles, both countries
have been busily developing a new
array of sophisticated instruments of
warfare, including anti-missile missiles,
orbital bombs, and missiles with
multiple warheads. At Cape Kennedy
the U.S. introduced two new long-
range missiles capable of delivering its
newest weapon Mirv (multiple
independently targeted re-entry
vehicle).
Each Mirv is capable of carrying
from three to ten hydrogen bombs and,
at a signal, can shower them on widely
scattered targets.
The super-secret Mirv represents a
major breakthrough in weaponry.
Mirv is counted on to overwhelm
enemy anti-missile defences through
the sheer number of bombs it can drop
and through the assortment of decoys
it carries to confuse enemy radar.
Conventional missiles carry a single
warhead that is aimed at a certain
point at a certain altitude, where it
then begins its free fall to a target.
Mirv, however, includes highly sophisti-
cated instruments for more precise
aiming and manoeuvring during the
descent. One missile thus could hit
several targets.
Mirv posed tough questions for
American-Russian arms negotiators.
Would Mirv tests accelerate the arms
race? Would they push the world to
a point of no return in weaponry?
Out of fear that the balance had been
changed to their disadvantage, would
the Russians now speed up work on
their own multiple warhead systems?
THE PEOPLE
PRAYER, THAT'S ALL
“I’LL PRAY for the Czechs,” said a
San Francisco woman, much quoted
in American papers. “But that’s about
as far as it goes.” She, and a majority
of other persons queried in cities
around the nation on the Russian in-
vasion of Czechoslovakia, agreed that
the United States should stay out, that
it was involved enough around the
world already.
Reactions to the aborting of Czech
liberalisation ranged from shock to
disappointment to anger. But those
queried, already preoccupied with the
Vietnam War and domestic social and
political problems, almost uniformly
disapproved of any U.S. intervention.
Hawk or dove, Democrat or Re-
publican, Americans had strong
opinions about the Vietnam commit-
ment and the major Presidential
candidates, and it did not appear that
the Czech crisis would change them.
While holding fast to their personal
views, however, some speculated that
the crisis might cause other voters to
swing toward Richard Nixon.
William Karelis, a Harvard Uni-
versity Senior, who works for the
McCarthy cause, said: “The crisis
doesn’t affect my thinking as such, but
it does make me think that McCarthy’s
chances are much less. It’s going to
give the hawks another irrational
argument that international Com-
munism is an expansionist threat that
we must fight on all fronts.”
WASHINGTON
THE WATCH ON
THE KREMLIN
WASHINGTON had been prepared
for a dramatic move by the Russians
against the new liberal regime in
Prague, but not for anything as bold
as an invasion by the Red Army.
Under-Secretary of State, Charles
Bohlen, a former U.S. Ambassador to
Moscow and an outstanding Krem-
linologist, had warned of the
possibility of a coup d’etat followed
by Soviet intervention in Czecho-
slovakia, but a direct invasion at this
time was not expected.
Although debates in the Soviet
Politburo are surrounded with the
greatest secrecy to project an image
of complete unanimity, on the basis
of the fragmentary information avail-
able, Washington analysts now be-
lieve the chief Kremlin hawks on
Czechoslovakia were Mikhail A.
Suslov, Andrei P. Kirilenko, Pyotr Y.
Shelest, and Aleksandr N. Shelepin
and the chief doves were Premier
Kosygin and Soviet President
Podgorny, while Party Chief Leonid I.
Brezhnev, was viewed as a centrist
shifting between camps and seeking,
until recently, to avoid too extreme a
position.
East Germany’s Party Leader, the
redoubtable Walter Ulbricht, was be-
lieved in Washington to have played
a key role in the still obscure train
of events leading up to the invasion.
The East German has been the most
clearly disturbed of the Communist
leaders at the liberalisation trend of
Czechoslovakia under Dubcek and
United States diplomats believe that
Ulbricht reported to Moscow that,
despite all his assurances, Dubcek was
unable to hold back the mounting
pressure inside Czechoslovakia for re-
forms reaching down to the basis of
Communist Party rule.
The “hard-liners” then gained con-
trol in the Kremlin and slammed the
iron curtain back into place. That
was the consensus of a dozen Krem-
linologists surveyed by the “Wall
Street Journal.” They predicted less
chance for a quick peace in Vietnam,
less chance for world-wide arms con-
trol, more suppression of liberal
thought within Russia and its satel-
lites, and an abundance of problems
for the Soviet leadership.
They also predicted that Russia’s
relations with nearly every nation
would worsen. And that, while in the
short run, the hard-liners in Moscow
could succeeed in keeping Eastern
Europe under their thumb, in the long
run international Communism would
disintegrate, since the invasion of
Czechoslovakia would be far more diffi-
cult for the Soviets to justify, even to
zealous Communists, than the 1956
Russian invasion of Hungary.
Similarly, American Kremlinologists
expected the Red Chinese to damn the
Soviet Union for the invasion. “The
Chinese, of course, are ideologically
unfriendly to any Czech revisionism,
but China would be even more
unfriendly to Soviet intervention
viewing it as a possible threat to them,”
said Professor Morton Kaplan, of the
University of Chicago. “I imagine
the Chinese will find a way of both
condemning the intervention and
condemning the Czechs.”
Senator Fulbright...harder to protest
THE CANDIDATES
SILENT SOFT-LINERS
WASHINGTON columnist Tom
Wicker reported a well-informed U.S.
official as reflecting, “After Czechoslo-
vakia where do people like Mansfield
and Fulbright go?”
Senators Mansfield and Fulbright,
who have been in the forefront of
those trying to lead American opinion
away from the kind of cold-war
mentality that saw the monolithic
Communist block implacably deter-
mined to rule the world, made no
response. But George McGovern, the
South Dakota liberal and late-blooming
Presidential candidate, saw the Czech
disaster as an indication that the Com-
munist bloc was not unified and that
“the force of nationalism” would always
divide it.
Senator McCarthy, who, of all major
politicians, has been the most sweeping
in his attacks on American foreign
policy, saw the United States morally
unable even to make a strong protest

against the actions of the Soviet
Union and its allies. The war in
Vietnam, and military interventions
in Cuba and the Dominican Republic,
McCarthy said at a news conference,
had made it “easier for the Russians
to move as they have moved” and
harder “for us to raise serious moral
and diplomatic protests.”
“This is not very ’compelling,”
wrote Wicker. “Soviet history sug-
gests that Moscow, by its lights,
simply found it necessary to act
against Czechoslovakia, and there is
every reason to believe that this
would have been so even if there were
no war in Vietnam and even if
Lyndon Johnson had never sent
20,000 marines to Santo Domingo.
“However one measures the moral
strength of Mr. Johnson’s strictures
on the Russians today, they can hardly
have any less effect on the Czech situa-
tion than did those of President Eisen-
hower when the Soviets crushed the
Hungarian uprising 12 years ago.”
KENNEDY
POLITICAL FALL-OUT
WHEN Senator Edward Kennedy,
ending two and a half months of
seclusion following his brother Robert’s
assassination, made an extremely
strong attack on the Vietnam policies
of the Johnson administration last
week, there was some speculation that
he might be making himself available
for last-minute Presidential nomina-
tion in Chicago, on the assumption
that it was just possible that the
Democratic Convention might dead-
lock.
Kennedy’s four-step formula for
getting the U.S. out of “the bottom-
less pit” of Vietnam was remarkably
like the Australian Labor Party’s: end
unconditionally the bombing of North
Vietnam; negotiate with Hanoi a
mutual withdrawal from South Viet-
nam of all foreign forces, both allied
and North Vietnamese; accompany the
withdrawal with help to the South
Vietnamese in building a viable poli-
tical, economic, and legal structure
that would not collapse upon American
departure; demonstrate to both Hanoi
and Saigon the sincerity of U.S. inten-
tions by significantly decreasing the
level of American military activity and
personnel in the South.
Washington observers were surprised
that Senator Kennedy did not soften
his attack on the Administration in
light of the events in Czechoslovakia,
but the “Boston Globe,” a strong
Kennedy supporter, said the speech
was significant for “the renewed thrust
given to the effort for a Vietnam peace
plank in the Democratic Party platform.
It is probably fair to say that much
of the hawkish reaction caused by the
Czech invasion will be countered by
the political fall-out of the Kennedy
speech.”


The shadow of Robert Kennedy
By HANS J. MORGENTHAU
In America the second wave of
appraisal of Robert Kennedy is
now beginning. Hans J. Morgen-
thaw’s recent estimate in “The
New York Review of Books,”
republished here, not only looks at
Kennedy with a sense of the
inadequacy of politics; it also casts
its light on the Presidential
candidates who survived him.
THE EMOTIONS have had their
day. We have witnessed a funeral which
for most of us must have been the most
moving ever seen, quite different in its
monumental privacy from the sombre
pomp and circumstance of John F. Ken-
nedy’s State funeral. The grief of a
family was made visible to millions. We
went with the widow to St. Patrick’s
at five o’clock in the morning, watched
her at solitary prayer, and followed her
to the coffin, averting our gaze when
she embraced that part of it where the
shattered head of her husband lay.
Yet even in those moments of private
grief which the nation shared it was
impossible not to think of politics. The
President of the United States paid his
respects three times to the dead man
at St. Patrick’s, at the Washington rail-
way station, and at the graveside—but
he had hated that man as that man had
hated him. Robert Kennedy regarded
Lyndon Johnson as a usurper. He had
become Vice-President by a fluke, by
accepting an offer which he was not ex-
pected to accept and which was seriously
intended for Stuart Symington. He had
been elevated to the Presidency through
an assassin’s bullet. It was by virtue of
both these accidents that Lyndon John-
son held supreme power. Thus Robert
Kennedy considered not attending the
first Cabinet meeting of President John-
son, and then made it a point to be
late; the symbolic significance of that
late entry was not lost upon the Presi-
dent. And in the early morning of the
day of President Johnson’s inaugura-
tion, Robert Kennedy went to his
brother’s graveside, and he went there
again in the afternoon with the photog-
raphers. He held a grudge against his
brother-in-law Sargent Shriver for
continuing to work for Lyndon John-
son.
What Robert Kennedy expected and
worked for, Johnson feared and tried to
prevent: that his tenure of office would
be an interregnum between the Presi-
dencies of two Kennedys. Thus Johnson
said in 1963 that he would never have
a Kennedy on his ticket, and in 1967, in
a face-to-face confrontation, he threat-
ened Robert Kennedy with political ex-
tinction within six months. To prevent
Robert Kennedy from becoming Presi-
dent of the United States had become
one of his major political goals, and
now, for the second time, not his efforts
but an assassin’s bullet settled the issue.
How galling it must be for a proud man
to contemplate that he owes his eleva-
tion to supreme power and the elimina-
tion of a hated rival to the accident of
two assassinations!
Robert Kennedy, like Lyndon John-
son, was a beneficiary of his brother’s
assassination. The most precious inheri-
tance John F. Kennedy left him was the
myth of his unfinished stewardship.
Nobody can say what John F. Kennedy
would have accomplished had he lived.
But it is certainly fair to say, as I did
at the time, that while he lived as Presi-
dent he achieved little of substance. His
domestic program was hopelessly
stymied in J Congress. In foreign policy,
he was responsible for the fiasco of the
Bay of Pigs; the Alliance for Progress
never got off the ground; he achieved a
tactical success and suffered a strategic
defeat in the Cuban missile crisis; he
started our serious involvement in Viet-
nam by increasing the number of mili-
tary advisers from 500 to 10,000; he
endeavored to counter the disintegration
of the Atlantic Alliance with the still-
born multilateral seaborne nuclear
force. Only the limited test-ban treaty
and the development of mobile con-
ventional military forces can be counted
real successes. The rest was rhetoric—
well-chosen, knowing, forward-looking
words, political literature of a high
order, from which no action followed.
Nevertheless, those words raised the
great issues of the day, of which the
preceding Administration was not even
aware, and proposed action to meet
them. They engendered the expectation
of great deeds, and were for a time
taken as a substitute for them. Thus,
when John F. Kennedy died without
having performed these deeds it was
easy to hold the accident of premature
death rather than intrinsic disability
responsible for that deficiency. It was
likewise easy to expect from the living
brother the achievement of the deeds
which the dead President’s rhetoric had
promised. The public 'mind, as well
as his own, identified Robert Kennedy
with his dead brother: what John F.
Kennedy would have done had he
lived, Robert Kennedy was called upon
to do in his stead. This was his mis-
sion ordained by fate. For him to
aspire to the Presidency, then, was not
a matter of choice but an ineluctable
duty, dictated not so much by' per-
sonal ambition and love of kin as by
v the natural order of things. As a king’s
oldest son becomes king on his father’s
death, so Robert had to succeed John
as a matter of course. So he saw him-
self, and so he was seen by untold mil-
lions at home and throughout the
world.
This identification of the living with
the dead brother was in an unintended
and ironic sense to the point. For while
Robert was lacking in the literary and
rhetorical gifts, and the intellectual
sophistication of his brother, both had
in common the inability to mould
political forces, which they could not
control, in support of their aims. In
other words, both were lacking in that
quality which distinguishes the states-
man from the politician. For this reason,
both were adept at organising election
campaigns where they were in control
of their workers as a general is in con-
trol of his army. And, for the same
reason, both were indifferent members
of the Senate and Robert was a
bored and unhappy one to boot —•
because neither knew how to deal with
Senators who are not to be ordered
about but must be induced by a peculiar
Senatorial diplomacy to support a
measure advocated by one of them.
They must be approached, very much
like sovereign nations, on the basis of
equality. They must be flattered, argued
with, threatened, promised, and given
advantages. And all this has to be done
on a strictly pragmatic basis. Senators,
like nations, to paraphrase Palmerston,
have no permanent friends and no per-
manent enemies, but only permanent
interests.
This approach to politics was. alien
to both John and Robert Kennedy.
They were imperial characters, who
found it difficult to relate themselves to
others on the basis of equality. They
wanted victory for themselves and de-
feat for the enemy, but not compromise,
which by definition is less than vic-
tory. They could give orders, reward-
ing those who obeyed and punishing


those who did not. They had permanent
friends and permanent enemies, and
they never forgot which was which.
Robert Kennedy accepted the courtiers
of John F. Kennedy as a matter of
course. He never repudiated Joe Mc-
Carthy, and never forgave Eugene Mc-
Carthy for his nomination of Stevenson
in 1960.
Thus Robert Kennedy was an
efficient campaign manager, cam-
paigner, and Attorney-General; for in
all those capacities he was in control.
Yet when he had to deal with the un-
controllable warring factions of the
Democratic Party in New York State
he was helpless; his intervention in the
gubernatorial campaign of 1966 was a
fiasco. And he made a mess of things
when he tried to come to terms with
William Manchester, who also could
not be controlled.
This disability common to both
brothers was aggravated in Robert’s
case by his moralistic approach to life
in general and to politics in particular.
His moral revulsion against evil, mani-
festing itself in the persecution of
wrong-doers and sympathy for the vic-
tims of wrong-doing, was one of the
two determinants of his being. Thus he
prosecuted Hoffa with single-minded
ferocity, and he opened his heart to the
poor throughout the world. These
simple and clear-cut positions, emotion-
ally attractive in themselves, require
in the actor an absolute certainty of
what is right and what is wrong.
Nobody who has deeply reflected upon
the issues of morality can have such
certainty. But, then, Robert Kennedy
was not reflective but emotional. He saw
wrong-doing and suffering and was re-
volted by it. He had to do something
about it. But since he was unaware of
the ambiguity of moral judgments, he
was also unaware of the moral and
pragmatic ambiguity of the political act
performed in emotional response to a
moral judgment. His approach was
morally fundamentalist and politically
simplistic: put Hoffa behind bars, and
stamp out poverty throughout the
world. Yet it never occurred to him
that such remedial action would call
forth new problems and new evils
which a statesman must take into
account before embarking upon it.
The other genuine determinant of
Robert Kennedy’s character was dedica-
tion to personal success. He was not a
crusader for a cause nor the spokesman
for a political philosophy. He wanted
to win the election he contested. He
might, in the process of that contest,
pick up a cause which could be used
for increasing his electoral chances,
and drop it as soon as it had done its
work. But he would not allow a cause,
or even an emotion, to stand in the
way of his personal success. Thus in
1964 his hatred of Johnson did not
prevent him from actively seeking the
Vice-Presidential nomination, and,
after being rebuffed, the ambassador-
ship to Vietnam. He would be cautious,
calculating, and ambiguous rather than
indignant if such a posture appeared
to enhance his chances for personal
success. His attitude toward the Viet-
nam War and his entry into the Presi-
dential primaries are cases in point.
Some Senators, such as Church, Ful-
bright, Gruening, and Morse, opposed
our militant military involvement in
the Vietnam War from the outset.
Kennedy was not among them. When
the first wave of protest struck the
country in 1965 in the form of the
teach-ins, Kennedy did not join it. He
did not go on record as opposing the
war as such, but only raised doubts
about its tactics. One of his most
prestigious advisers, Arthur Schlesinger,
took the side of the Johnson Adminis-
tration. Another of his principal
advisers, Richard Goodwin, published
in 1966 a book advocating the continu-
ation of the war in South Vietnam.
When, in 1966, 16 Senators addressed
a letter to the President asking for the
continuation of the bombing pause,
Kennedy’s name was not among them.
He spoke out clearly against Adminis-
tration policies for the first time in Feb-
ruary, 1966. He dismissed military
victory and withdrawal and advocated
a negotiated settlement which would
allow the Viet Cong “participation” in
the Government and would exclude
“domination of internal conquest.” For
more than a year following this speech
Kennedy kept silent on Vietnam. When
he spoke again in March, 1967, he
reiterated his previous proposal, ampli-
fied by the suspension of the bombing
of North Vietnam and the commitment
of both sides not to escalate the war.
We are here not concerned with the
intrinsic merits of these proposals but
only with their relation to the position
of the Administration. They appear as
modifications of that position rather
than as clearcut alternatives to it. Their
motivation has been formulated by
William V. Shannon:*
“His cold shrewdness and his passion
enabled Kennedy to abandon his pre-
vious commitment to the Vietnam War.
Like his father, he has a speculator’s
ability to size up a proposition and
decide whether it looks like a winner.
No emotion, no ideological fixation, no
wishful romanticism clouds or confuses
this analytic process. Self-interest is the
controlling criterion . , . Passion, too,
plays its part. Robert Kennedy’s dislike
of Lyndon Johnson, bordering upon
hatred, made it easier for him to change
his mind about Vietnam the more he
thought of it as Mr. Johnson’s war . . .
Actions in Vietnam that Robert
Kennedy would have stoutly defended
if JFK had ordered them became sus-
pect in his eyes since their author was
LBJ.”
A clear example of cautious calcula-
tion and miscalculation is pro-
vided by the manner in which Robert
Kennedy entered the Presidential prim-
aries. It is, of course, axiomatic that in
normal times it is a hopeless, if not
suicidal, undertaking to contest the
renomination of an incumbent President.
Kennedy complied with this axiom and
probably went beyond it in his repeated
endorsement of the re-election of the
incumbent President. The axiom
required abstention from active compe-
tition; it did not require a declaration
on television to the effect that “I have
great admiration for President John-
son.” Yet, when McCarthy’s victory in
the New Hampshire primary showed
that the timds were not normal,
Kennedy recalculated his chances and
decided to compete for the Presidential
nomination.
It is this conjunction of moral cer-
tainty about right and wrong with cal-
culating opportunism which accounts
for Kennedy’s reputation for ruthless-
ness. The issue, however, is more com-
plex than that. If Kennedy had gone
after Hoffa in the way he did for purely
selfish reasons, he would indeed deserve
the epithet. However, if one sees one-
self as the champion of justice against
a monstrous evil, does not the nobility
of the end and the magnitude of its
denial justify the extraordinary charac-
ter of the means used? Furthermore,
if unconsciously the defence of right
against wrong merges with the pro-
motion of one’s own political success
so that personal success and the
triumph of right come close to being
interchangeable, is one not entitled to
be as “ruthless” in, say, misrepresenting
the record of Senator Keating in the
campaign of 1964 as one was in disre-
garding procedural niceties in the
prosecution of Hoffa? Such an argu-
ment naturally does not concern itself
with the fundamental question as to-
whether the democratic ethic permits
anyone to be so certain in distinguish-
ing right from wrong in the pursuit
of personal success. Among the many
quotations Robert Kennedy used, one
does not find what Cromwell said to
the representatives of the Church of
Scotland: “I beseech you, in the bowels
of Christ, to think it possible you may
be mistaken.”
The same conjunction of an emotion-
ally founded moral certainty with
opportunistic calculation accounts for
Kennedy’s frequent lack of intellectual
perception. The vital force of his being
was in his emotions, not in his mind.
When in November, 1965, he went
down' into one of the coalmines of
Lota in Chile and saw the misery of
the miners, all Communists, he reacted
in these words: “If I worked in this
mine I’d be a Communist, too.” That
is to say he implicitly affirmed the
moral right and political necessity of
revolution. He even affirmed it ex-
plicitly by telling his student audience
* In “The Heir Apparent: Robert
Kennedy and the Struggle for Power.”
Macmillan (1967).


in Lima, Peru, that “The responsibility
of our times is nothing less than a
revolution ... We can affect its>-
character; we cannot alter its inevit-
ability.” Yet while he was in the Govern-
ment he was the main promoter of
counter-insurgency, intended to counter
Communist revolution. That tech-
nique proved to be utterly useless in
Vietnam. Its failure derives from a
profound misunderstanding of the
nature of contemporary revolutions.
For it is absurd to expect that these
revolutions, nourished by the vital
national and social aspirations of great
masses of people, can be successfully
opposed by a military strategy
developed by academic theorists and
applied by military tacticians.
When Robert Kennedy, after his trip
to Latin America, presented his philos-
ophy and program for Latin America in
May, 1966, to the Senate in a long and
thoroughly researched address—so long
as to have had to be delivered in two
parts —he again missed completely the
fundamental problem of revolution.
Robert Kennedy had a personal stake
in the Alliance for Progress as one of
his late brother’s great innovations in
foreign policy. Yet he failed to see —
and he was, of course, not alone in this
failure the fatal ailment which had
paralysed the Alliance for Progress from
the very outset. That ailment was the
attempt to bring about radical social,
political, and economic change through
the instrumentality of oligarchies, whose
political power derives from the status
quo and who have, therefore, a vital
interest in preventing such radical
change. Thus his emotional and moral
reaction to the evils he saw in Latin
America and elsewhere in the under-
developed world was translated into
conventional political proposals which
had been proved to miss the basic
political point in the past and, hence,
could not succeed in the future, even if
they were supported with greater effort.
Yet, and most importantly, that same
emotional and moral reaction, which
proved to be a dubious asset for Robert
Kennedy as a politician, became the
source of his final triumph as a charis-
matic leader. He entered the Presiden-
tial primaries as a calculating politician
who was quick to see a miscalculation
and set it right, and he was still one in
the Indiana campaign when he played
to the prejudices of the electorate. Yet
when he made his last speech in Los
Angeles he had become the adored
leader of millions of disillusioned people
and the incarnation of the hopes of
the disinherited of America. His capac-
ity for moral indignation had found
its cause, the voice of moral protest had
found its audience, the malaise that ails
America appeared to have found its
cure. In this last respect, Robert
Kennedy came to perform the same
function in 1968 as that which his
brother had performed in 1960. That is,
he faced the problems of the day with
the rhetoric appropriate to them, rather
than with that of yesterday or the day
before. This is the great advantage he
had over Humphrey and Nixon.
It is, of course, idle to speculate as to
what Robert Kennedy would have
made of this great asset had he lived.
There is no doubt that he was ill at
ease bearing the mantle of the charis-
matic leader. His hair was turning
grey, his face had become deeply lined,
and his hands trembled, and there was
frequently a stridency in his voice, a
tenseness in his manner which one does
not expect to find in a man destined
to be a charismatic leader. Was he the
driver on a road freely chosen, or
driven by a fate he could not escape?
But even if Robert Kennedy had not
fulfilled the promise which millions of
people saw in him, he would have per-
formed a vital function for America.
He noticed three months before his
death what Rockefeller had just dis-
covered, too, that the mood of the
country and, more particularly, of
large groups within the Democratic
Party does not conform to the tradi-
tional pattern of the two-party system.
A great many people are aware of the
bankruptcy of the philosophies, the
programs, and the policies by which
we have been governed. They are aware
of the unbridgeable gap between the
reality of the issues with which we
must come to terms, and the modes
of thought and action by which we are
being governed. They think that it is
time for a change, not just in the
personnel of the Government replac-
ing Mr. Johnson with either Mr.
Humphrey or Mr. Nixon but in the
modes of thought and action them-
selves. Kennedy gave a voice to these
aspirations.
That this voice has been forever
stilled Is the great loss the country has
sustained. Even if Robert Kennedy had
lived, it is likely he would not have
been nominated in 1968. Yet this
passionate voice, contemporary and
addressing the future, would have
reminded us that there exists an altern-
ative to Humphrey’s liberalism of 30
years ago and to the timeless oppor-
tunism of Nixon. It would have been
proof to those of us who were ready
to opt out of the American political
system altogether at the beginning of
this year, not only that there are alter-
natives to the obsolete philosophies and
policies of the powers-that-be but that
there are men willing to search for those
alternatives and put them into effect.
Only Eugene McCarthy today fulfils
that function. That so relatively ineffec-
tual a campaigner can have such a
success is a measure of the extent and
the depth of the dissatisfaction in the
ranks of the Democratic Party. It is
also the measure of the success Robert
Kennedy might have achieved had he
lived and indeed of what might still
happen if a sufficient number of disen-
chanted voters demonstrate to the man-
agers of the Democratic convention that
Humphrey cannot win.
Conversely, McCarthy’s success points
to the danger the Republic now faces.
If these masses, deprived of a charis-
matic leader, should find his candidacy
faltering, they would have no place in
the present American political system.
The unrepresentative character of
American democracy might well become
so extreme as to be intolerable to them.
In consequence, they may either sink
'into political apathy or attack the
system from without. In either case, the
political forces most likely to benefit
from the disintegration of the Kennedy
camp would be those who defend the
status quo which, in view of the
widespread disaffection, can only be
defended by Fascist means. It goes
without saying that such a defence
would be undertaken in the name of
law and order and democracy.
Thus, the myth of Robert Kennedy is
likely to b< very similar to that of his
late brother: the leader who showed us
the promised land and would have led
us into it had he lived. On the strength
of the historic record, one can only say
that they knew that there was a prom-
ised land and that it wasn’t the one we
were living in. It will forever remain
a moot question as to whether they
would have been able to lead us into it
had they lived. But that intellectual and
emotional awareness of the distance
between the actual conditions of Ameri-
can life and what they ought to be set
them apart from Nixon and Humphrey.
For Nixon is convinced that the status
quo is all we need to have, prompted by
private enterprise and protected by fiscal
responsibility and the police. Humphrey,
on the other hand, enthusiastically
believes that there is nothing wrong with
America that could not be remedied by
liberal reform. His call for a domestic
Marshall Plan shows clearly the limits:
of his political imagination. For, as I
pointed out in 1956, while the Marshall
Plan has regenerated the productive cap-
acity of Western Europe, it. has left its-
economic, social, and political structure
by and large intact. The dangers to the
stability and strength of Western Europe,
which have grown in the past from the
defects of that structure, have continued
to grow because those defects were not
repaired. The Marshall Plan almost
completely lost sight of those roots of
instability and unrest which antedated
the emergency and were bound to oper-
ate after it was over. What was true
of the original Marshall Plan would also-
be true of Humphrey’s domestic version.
Their breadth of vision sets the two dead
Kennedys apart from their contempor-
ary rivals. For that alone they have
earned the gratitude of their country-
men, and no myths are needed to evoke
or deepen it.

The Vice-Chancellors
Delegates to the Commonwealth Universities’ Congress in Sydney last week.
Left to right, Dr. H. V. Pataskar, University of Poona, Sister Alice Wallace,
of Mount Saint Vincent, Nova Scotia, and Professor G. P. Malalasekera,
of the University of Ceylon
AS EVERYBODY KNOWS, there’s
trouble in academe, and the stone-walled
serenity of Sydney University’s Great
Hall seemed more anachronistic than
ever last week when 700 delegates to the
Tenth Commonwealth Universities’
Congress gathered there to discuss “their
role.”
The Governor-General, Lord Casey,
fresh from a similar appearance at the
Australian Medical Association’s Con-
gress the week before, opened proceed-
ings by touching on the self-doubt inher-
ent in the theme of the congress.
“A generation or so ago, even per-
haps in the 1920 s and 19305, I believe
you would not have chosen a theme
that seems to reflect some heretical
doubt as to what the role of the uni-
versity should be. However, here you
are, prepared to discuss it all without
any semblance of raised eyebrows . .
In his own Cambridge days, he added,
Oxford and Cambridge had been
labelled places which taught men how
to spend £lOOO a year, while the other
British universities taught them how to
earn £lOOO a year. Now, he guessed,
utilitarianism had taken the place of
scholarship for its own sake, even at
Oxbridge.
But the words “student disturbances”
were obviously occupying the vice-regal
mind as much as they were everybody
else’s, and he lost no time in introduc-
ing them. “It may well be that the
subject must be answered by each uni-
versity for itself, and that there is no
generalised answer . . . but . . . even in
this imperfect world, things don’t hap-
pen on a wide scale without a reason.
Some enlightenment from this great
gathering would be appreciated by many
people.”
At times in the days ahead, it seemed
that such enlightenment would also be
appreciated by the academics themselves,
but a good deal of soul-searching was
done although not enough to upset
what someone had termed the “aca-
demic junketing.”
There was still time for a lunch-hour
lesson in the art of boomerang throw-
ing on one of the university ovals, “a
Colonial Sydney tour,” and bus trips to
other universities in Sydney.
Nevertheless, the 16 papers delivered
during the week provoked some inter-
esting newspaper headlines, especially
the speeches of the first day.
Sir Hugh Ennor, whose job as Sec-
retary of the Commonwealth Depart-
ment of Education and Science makes
his opinion particularly interesting to
his fellow-Australian academics, cited
poor teaching as one cause for the high
failure-rate in universities here, and in
doing so, opened up one of the con-
gress’ main discussion points the
conflict between teaching and research.
In the academic status game, research
activity has always earned larger and
tastier carrots than teaching ability, and
the price has often been undergraduate
disillusionment with university as a
meeting ground for minds.
Why should a student care when his
lecturer obviously doesn’t?
A paper prepared by Sir Eric Ashby,
Vice-Chancellor of Cambridge Uni-
versity, who was unable to attend the
congress, echoed Sir Hugh’s disapproval,
mentioning examples of some dons’
reluctance to teach at all, and urging
the creation of an ethical code to com-
bat this “the university teacher’s
analogue of a Hippocratic oath.”
At a time when universities are being
cynically called “degree factories” by
their students, Sir Eric’s views about a
possible, in fact, essential, alliance
between research and teaching at least


raise their voices

the University of Lagos, Nigeria

Chancellor, University of Lagos

Burgess, University of Manchester

had a stimulating and imaginative ring
about them, even if he was apologising
for being “starry-eyed.”
“First, the pupil *must become
familiar with orthodoxy. He must
absorb and understand what is already
known about his subject. But this is
only the first step in a full university
education, though it is as far as many
students ever get.
“The pupil then has to learn how to
question orthodoxy, but to do so in a
special kind of way. Not like the
nihilist, whose object is to destroy
what is believed or practised and to
put nothing in its place; nor like the
pedant who questions and (corrects
only trivialities. It has to be a con-
structive dissent which fulfils one'
over-riding condition: it must shift the
state of opinion about the subject in
such a way that other experts in the
subject are prepared to concur.
“This, you will be thinking . . .
does not bear much relation to a giant
first-year class in English or biology.
Of course it does not; and, of course,
the great majority of university stu-
dents never become research workers
and have little opportunity to exercise
the discipline of dissent, at any rate
until their last year in the university.
“This is not important. What is
important is that a university gradu-
ate should have watched his teacher
exercising this attitude of scepticism
toward the traditional and orthodox
view.
“And . . . we must not be surprised
if students, to whom we are teaching
the discipline of dissent, express,
though often in a la’mentably undis-
ciplined way, their dissatisfaction with
the university itself.”
Sir Fred Schonell, Vice-Chancellor
of the University of Queensland, also
exhibited understanding toward
student protesters—they were diligent,
idealistic, and ready “to face social
problems with complete honesty.”
However, .he couldn’t help wishing
they didn’t get so violent about it.
After all, he seemed to feel, they
mabe it more difficult for uni-
versifies to get increased financial
support from the States.
It was a practical point of view, if
perhaps a narrow one, and was pointed
next day when Sir Richard Luyt,
Vice-Chancellor of the University of
Capetown announced he would be
cutting short his visit because of
student sit-ins at his university.
Students were protesting against a
Government order to rescind the
appointment of a black African lec-
turer to the staff. It was a stand some
of the African delegates at the
Congress must have privately
applauded for its lack of narrowness
an “ lts practicality.
At conferences like these scholar-
ship is supposed to transcend politics,
but 1I ? 1 the . tW .° are often in-
separable. The principal of the Uni-
versity College of Rhodesia, Professor

j n S ph e Q f t his, his un i vers ity has 44
percent black students and is the most
evenly mixed in Africa, as well as
having the highest standards of any

“We don’t quite know what flag
we are sailing under or who our
masters are,” he added. “When I
make myself agreeable to the black
population I antagonise the white,
When I make myself agreeable to the
Rhodesian Government I antagonise
the British Government.”
Professor V. E. King, Dean of the
Faculty of Education at Njala Uni-
versity College, Sierra Leone, declared
that the African revolution had been,
betrayed and universities should be-
come involved in politics to help cure
the crisis.
Professor Kin? said that academics
tended t 0 think politicians were fools
and politic" ns tended to regard
“academics” as high-brow theorists,
“Some politicians, 55 he said, “are so

audience) and she had no hesitation
in placing full blame on the men
there. “They just didn’t think to invite
the competent wotnen in their
universities.”
Yet discussion at the plenary ses-
sions didn’t often lift itself out of
dullness; even the jokes were sparse.
The Deputy Vice-Chancellor of Cam-
bridge, , Professor A. L. Armitage,
scored highest points with a piece of
academic bitchery aimed at the
American fondness for “trawling the
off-shore academic waters of England
in search of doctrinal dissertation.”
“They often dredged up some strange
crustaceans for our delectation,” he
said.
At times,, parochialism just could
not be overcome. People seemed con-
stantly to be casting around, without
success, for some point at which their
problems intersected with their
colleagues from other countries.
Financial troubles in Canadian uni-
versities were followed by remarks
about studies on water buffalo made
at a Pakistani agricultural university,
then the British delegates embarked
on a short session in correcting
one another on the state of the British
universities system at moments
like that, the idea of the Common-
wealth seemed more tenuous than
ever, a changing, insubstantial shape
getting lost somewhere up above in
the Great Hall’s nave.
Dr. Colin Mackay. President of
the University of New Brunswick in
Canada, seemed intimidated by the
topicality of the first day’s speeches.
Peering over half-moon glasses, he
began in a deliberately down-beat
style by saying he came from a back-
water relatively free of student
unrest. “However, even there we do
have 'the occasional refugee professor
from the United States and its in-
volvement in Vietnam. Our students
have discovered it can be fun to march
on Washington and even more fun to
march on the local Government.”
By then, even the words “student
unrest” were enough to provoke a
mass move of to paper among
the journalists present, but Dr. Mac-
kay wasn’t going much further along
that tack. His subject was finance,
and he was there simply because
“he’d managed to survive in this
occupation for 15 years something
of a rarity and very much an oddity.”
Dr. Mackay’s pessimistic view of
his job was echoed in a paper given
by Professor H. G. Thode, of Canada’s
McMaster University, who talked of
“an identity crisis” afflicting aca-
demics. It sounded almost as dramatic
a disease as “student unrest.”
Quoting an article titled “The
Malcontent Professors,” which appeared
in the American magazine “Fortune,”
Professor Thode said the academic’s
function as a teacher “seemed neither
to satisfy him nor give him status
any longer.” No wonder the students
are worried. After all, everybody else
seems to be.


Meanwhile, back in Brisbane...
DENIS O'BRIEN returns to the city
where he graduated as an Australian
IT WAS in Brisbane that I was first
called a Pommy bastard. Eighteen years
ago this month. I’ve never kept the
anniversary but I’ve grown to regard
Brisbane as my Australian alma mater.
Both my sons were born there, and in
a total of seven years living in Brisbane
I came as close to graduating as an
Australian as Australians will allow
Pommy bastards to become.
Dear old Brisbane . . . seedy, pro-
vincial, chasing, with the whole of
Queensland, an eternal “potential,”
and the least attractive of all the
State capitals; a place from which to
take off with ambition and idealism
intact, a bolt-hole for the first sign of
an incipient ulcer. Sometimes I think
of the place as Australia in honest
microcosm: pleasantly complacent,
reluctantly standing up with the rest
of the world, but secretly wishing it
could be left alone to eat mangoes.
Brisbane is more comfortably close to
the basics of life than anywhere I’ve
ever lived.
Memories. I’d grubbed in Fleet
Street, been patted on the head by
Hannen Swaffer, and offered myself as
England’s answer to Australian jour-
nalism. Australia House wasn’t
impressed. “We’re up to our hocks in
journalists,” said the man, “but if you
want a quick passage, the Queensland
Government will nominate you.” As a
farm worker. Hey ho and off to adven-
ture. And 1 never did thank that
Queensland Labor Government for its
indulgence of my agricultural
inadequacies.
August, 1950 . . . Brisbane weather
at its most beguiling. By day an
English summer, by night an English
winter. And penniless. I’ve often tried
to remember how it was, but the eyes
and ears of my audiences haven’t
helped. They’ve never believed it. “Tell
us yer Charlie Dickens story, you
Pommy bastard,” said a wicked Aus-
tralian. Perhaps it would have been
better if I’d arrived with £5, but I
didn’t. And I’ve never been able to
think of anywhere safer than Brisbane
to arrive with less.
In a high-ceilinged room of the
“Yungaba” migrant hostel on Kanga-
roo Point, an unnerving moment of
truth. “A farm worker, eh,” said a man
from Employment. And then, “Can
you kill a sheep? , . . Go on, son, go
for your life. But just make sure you
never give us a bad write-up!” The
ease with which I walked out of my
two-year commitment with Australia
has often puzzled me. I’ve blessed it
for the memorable feeling of indepen-
dence I had' as I walked, two miles
high, across the Story Bridge; some-
times rued it for robbing me of a much
deeper experience, which I now know
I’ll never have.
Gentle Brisbane . . . letting me down
lightly for not being able to kill an
Australian sheep; careful not to hurt
me when it resisted my first attempts to
contribute to its newspapers. The
impeccably courteous senior journalist
who interviewed me at the “Courier-
Mail,” still there, still impeccably
courteous, and still about as represen-
tative of the cosy sense of Doing that
I have come to associate with Brisbane
. . . “We’d really like to have you on
our staff, old chap. But the fact is,
we’re not recruiting anyone at present
. . . recession, newsprint shortage. You
know.” I didn’t. But it didn’t seem to
matter.
Money! Imperative. The City
Electric Light Company (since
devoured by a much larger complex,
but the awful office building is still
there) . . . “You have, to understand
that we’re not clock watchers in Aus-
tralia,” said the chief clerk. “We like
the man who’s at his desk before half
past eight in the morning, and still
there when the bell goes at six minutes
past five in the afternoon.” My first
brush with the great Australian lie.
Four weeks at £B/7/6 a week and
Kafka is for real. Sanity is an Aus-
tralian home in Plunkett Street,
Paddington, one of Brisbane’s ugliest
suburbs (then and now), but a
weatherboard paradise for anyone try-
ing to put down roots.
A jolly, chain-smoking landlady and
her dour but kindly husband, who
worked in Fair Rents. Very big, then.
The radio played all day. Breakfast
with 4BC a bewildering experience
for anyone reared on the disciplines of
the BBC and dinner was Jack Davey
or Bob Dyer. On Saturdays, The Races.
Since then, I have never been able to
listen to the Saturday afternoon sounds
of Australia without thinking of the
Brisbane suburb of Paddington. The
crescendoes from Randwick and Flem-
ington still seem hysterical, but I’m
privately fond of them.
“You’d better get out into the Bush,”
said Fair Rents. “They need journalists.
And you’d learn about Australia.” I
was uneasy about leaving Brisbane. It
was mine. The Brisbane “Telegraph”
offered a job in the reading room, but
that wasn’t enough for someone who’d
been smiled on by Hannen Swaffer.
Perversely, to a paper-box factory in
Spring Hill, an unloved inner suburb
still crying out for the enhancement of
tasteful, modern architecture.
“I can see you’ve never worked one
of these machines before,” said a Map
of Australia, considerate enough not
to add, “you Pommy bastard.” I
Civic Square in the making...“change
leading toward disfigurement”
hadn’t, but I did. They don’t make
paper boxes like they did, I can tell
you. Lunchtime introduced me to the
Australian crouch; down on your
haunches and into a pastie and then a
vanilla slice. Brisbane makes the best
vanilla slices in the world; and I’ll
back their crouch against any in
Australia.
At night, another world. Kitchen
hand and waiter in an Albert Street
coffee lounge. I see it’s now a tea
shop. In 1950 it was part of the
sophistication of young Brisbane. Bris-
bane’s liquor laws are still holding back
the social development of the place.
When I returned to Brisbane, more
than five years later, it was as a col-
league of Impeccably Courteous, and
the late Arthur Richards was contri-
buting a daily column to the “Courier-
Mail” which still stands as the best
piece of Brisbane mythology ever
written. Richards was as gentle as the
Long Pocket reach of the Brisbane
River and he saw his city through the
beautiful haze that briefly settles over
the place at noon on most Saturdays
of the year. Arthur Richards’ Brisbane
was good to live in. It was a private
vision he had one in which there
were always mangoes and papaws
gently plopping to the ground at the
bottom of everyone’s garden but
he managed to make us all share it.
His suburban Clayfield was soft,
friendly, familiar. Now it has reverted
to its Prestige Status and I wonder
why I ever envied Richards for living
there.
Since leaving it to come to Sydney I
have returned to Brisbane many times.
But when I went back there this month
if I felt anything in my heart, it was
only a slight pain. It is not a superior
pain, simply one that aches to see the

city as it could be, not the reluctant
imitation of a big city it is becoming.
In the scrawny heart of the city the
same sort of building activity is going
on that is changing the face of most
Australian capitals, only, in Brisbane,
the change seems to be leading toward
disfigurement. Queen Street, the retail
main stem, is spotty, lacking the vicari-
ous satisfactions of glossy window-
dressing and littered with more art
union ticket sellers than ever before.
New buildings are rising, but 10, 20, or
•30 storeys towering over the double-
storey norm will just draw the eye to
the pathetic. And George Street, a once
strangely fascinating street of odd shops
leading to Roma Street railway station,
is now pathetically representative of a
Brisbane trying to dress up its business
and commercial heart without much
purposeful motivation. The new, multi-
storey District Court building makes
Lennons Hotel opposite look upstaged.
Out in the older weatherboard
suburbs, the three-yearly paint job is
still the only defence against the sub-
tropical seediness that always seems to
be threatening to overwhelm Brisbane.
If some home-owners have begun to
drop their defence, then at least they
look more relaxed and at ease with the
world than they do in Sydney’s Frenchs
Forest.
Of the newer suburbs, Kenmore
offers the all-Australian version of
instant gracious living. It’s a target
for newlyweds, a rich prop for the
furnishing industry, and a great resting
place for coffee-table books. But it is
not distinctively Brisbane, and it 'makes
me sad to see that it is not doing
enough to improve Brisbane’s suburban
disregard of trees.
Progress, transition is a painful busi-
ness in Brisbane. In my experience it
always has been. If you’re a boat-
rocker in Brisbane, you virtually have
to move to Sydney . . . dreaded Sydney
. . . “Good heavens! What do you want
to go there )for?” They’ll have you by
the short hairs there, boy,” “How can
you stand it down there?”
Clem Jones, Brisbane’s Lord Mayor,
is a boat-rocker; he almost rocks, rows,
and hauls the boat single-handed these
days. But the charm with which he is
propelling his progressivism seems to
be wearing thin, even among the people
who keep electing him back to office.
He has begun burning Brisbane’s trams,
tearing up the tram tracks “Bloody
disgrace,” says the eternal taxi-driver,
who is beginning to whip through
tram-free traffic with heart-stopping
disregard for safety. Alderman Jones
is also creating a civic square out of
what was King George Square and a
row of commercial buildings. In its
transitionary stage it looks revolting,
and the buildings left bordering it look
ugly and provincial.
But at night, on a hill in Indooroo-
pilly, cradling a Brisbane staple rum
in the company of cherished friends,
Brisbane softens, and seems sane, and
dull, and relaxed. “When are you
coming back to Brisbane, you Pommy
bastard?” And I wonder.


BUSINESS
AND THE ECONOMY
Defending
gold-plated
barricades
ICIANZ’s $5 million ethylene oxide plant—support values cut on many derivatives
HIT EARLIER this month by the
removal or reduction of a range of
support values for chemicals, ICIANZ
opened up before the Tariff Board in
Melbourne last week a major inquiry
into a broad segment of the industry
by seeking support values and higher
duty for caustic soda, a key product.
It is probably the forerunner of many
moves by the industry to preserve its
protectionist barricades as the more-
free traders of the Board and the
Treasury continue their efforts to turn
the tide.
The 1966 introduction of support
values for the chemical industry has
been considered as one of the high-
water marks of Australian protec-
tionism. But it was appropriate enough
that chemicals, in particular, should
have been selected for the extra cos-
seting. Price wars are endemic in the
world’s chemical markets. Such a
capital-intensive industry shows con-
siderable cost advantages through
large-scale establishes or
expands capacity in the largest steps
possible, and is perpetually grappling
with cut-throat competition as the
consequent bouts of over-capacity
ensue.
Some protection measures are
needed, but with world chemical prices
behaving like yo-yos, ad valorem duties
are not an efficient solution. In Aus-
tralia, the mechanism of appealing for
dumping duties was considered too
cumbersome to provide all the addi-
tional protection required; support
values, it was argued, would complete
the answer.
Support values were stated to be
based on representative world prices free
of dumping and other elements of price
disruption, after payment of import
duties and freight costs. Should im-
ported chemicals be offered on the Aus-
tralian market below the support values,
then additional duties would be levied
to bring the price within 10 percent of
the support value. The 10 percent gap
was intended as an incentive for
chemical manufacturers to seek further
cost savings, or perhaps as a sop for
the free traders. Many members of the
Treasury and the Tariff Board con-
sidered this the ultimate in gold-plated
protectionism, nonetheless.
That for the chemical industry prob-
ably more than for any other the
concept of support values could be most
easily justified makes it all the more
painful a business to withdraw some
such measures once instituted. But the
Tariff Board and its chairman, Mr. Alf
Rattigan, have weathered enough storms
lately not to be put off by such senti-
mental considerations. In the recent
review of support values for the
chemical industry the Board wielded a
surgical knife to remove support values
altogether from 12 items, to cut back
those on 22 more, to leave eight un-
changed and to increase three others.
In doing so it was concerned only
that support values should provide
“a reasonable return on funds to the
lowest-cost local producer”; that their
basis should be a “representative”
overseas price.
The Board took nothing for granted.
In the case of vinyl acetate, local in-
dustry claimed that new capacity
currently under construction in other
parts of the world would soon lead
to an unstable situation and disruptive
low pricing. The Board, after con-
sidering all available information on
the matter, decided that this was very
doubtful and removed the support
value. In the case of phthalate esters
the Board decided that new capacity
could well add up to low-pricing
in the near future and the previous
support value was maintained.
The moves were as fair as could
be expected but still produced too
hard a pill for the chemical industry
to swallow. Already achieving only a
low return of funds employed
3.2 percent before tax and 2.0 per-
cent after tax for the year ended
last December according to the
Australian Chemical Industry Council
it is now faced with the need for
price reductions over a wide range
of products in order to remain com-
petitive with imports.
Concerned with enhancing invest-
ment prospects in the industry and
achieving enough cash flow to keep
it up-to-date and expanding, its ’mem-
bers are particularly worried that
the recent cuts in support values are
only the first breach in their protective
walls. But the industry could well be
big enough now to bear a little more
exposure. Ten years ago, investment
in the industry stood at $72 million,
and today, including plant under con-
struction and planned, investment is
estimated at over $4lO million. Ten
years ago there was nothing worth
calling an export trade, and now it is
worth more than $l4 million a year
for members of ACIC alone. Of the
500 basic chemical products now
manufactured in Australia, something
like 160 can now compete on the
world market.
Out there, the chemical industry has
the usual disadvantageous by-product
of Australian protectionist policies to
contend with: high construction costs,
smaller-scale production, expensive
labor, and ancillary services, and
higher freight charges. Many of these,
says the ACIC, have been overcome
by selling overseas on a marginal cost-
ing basis. It will be interesting to see
just how many accusations of marginal
costing will be levelled at foreign
chemical importers into Australia over
the coming months, whether in the
name of dumping duties or further
support values.
SHIPPING
FREIGHT WAR?
QUITE BLUNTLY, if the 300 wool
exporters who have agreements with
the Australia-to-Europe Shipping Con-
ference expiring on August 31 do not
extend them, then they will not get
the 4.5 percent freight reductions
offered earlier this month. But the
exporters (8., August 10) still want
bigger reductions.
At first, with the wool shippers
fragmenting into separate groups for
re-negotiating the rates, the Confer-
ence’s take-it-or-leave-it attitude was
understandable. But now the Confer-
ence is itself under attack from inside
and out. A freight war is a possibility.
Within the Conference, the Germans
have been taking some long looks at


the increasing flow of Australian wool
into the European Economic Com-
munity and, on the theory that national
ships should carry a more substantial
proportion of national imports and
exports, have been asking for a bigger
share of the Conference business. The
Germans and the British tend to
agree that this increase should be at
the expense of the Scandinavian lines,
who have in turn refused to surrender
any share of the Australian trade.
Australian interests, with an eye on
the Scandinavians’ enthusiasm for
more efficient handling and shipping
techniques, have suggested that the
British should surrender a part of their
23 percent share in Australia-Europe
trade to the Germans. The changing
pattern of the Australian wool trade
with the EEC now taking 1.6 million
bales of wool compared with Britain’s
500,000 bales is duly noted.
• With the internal struggles of the
Conference developing apace, the
Russians Inade specific demands for
entry into the Australian trade, prefer-
ably as a partner, but if not, then in
competition. With an original demand
for 36 sailings a year the Russians
dropped the figure to 24 and the
Conference suggested 12 in the hope
that a figure of 18 might be agreed
upon. To this end, Conference dele-
gates arranged to go to Moscow at
the end of the month.
But with the Soviet invasion of
Czechoslovakia last week it seems that
the negotiations are off. They were
always politically precarious anyway.
The Russians will presumably be
left to look for their trade outside the
Conference and add what they can to
the 12 Polish sailings scheduled for the
coming year. Already they have had
talks with members of Interlaine and
the British Wool Federation on freight
rates, quoting, it is reported, much
lower rates than the Conference (in
the event of a competitive outcome).
For the moment, the wool shippers
hold the trump hand and those of
Interlaine are currently bargaining
with the disgruntled Scandinavian lines
for lower freight rates than the Con-
ference as a whole is prepared to
offer. On top of this, they hold the
future economic viability of the new
container ships in their hands. The
ships will need wool more than ever
to go on subsidising the freight rates
of other Australian exports. But wool,
so eminently suited to other forms of
unit handling as well as the Scan-
dinavians have demonstrated cer-
tainly does not need containers.
Should a freight war develop on the
Australia-Europe run, the rationalisa-
tion of the Conference system would
tend to break down; freight charges
for other exports could be increased
substantially; and that wouldn’t help
Australia’s balance of payments. The
Conference certainly cannot afford a
take-it-or-leave-it attitude toward the
wool shippers’ demands for lower
freight rates but nor, come to that,
can the wool shippers toward freight
wars.
MEN AND MATTERS
AFTER THIRTY YEARS with the
U.S. Government, Mr. Basil Capella
was entitled to full annuity, and was
thinking of leaving the foreign service,
when executives of TraveLodge Aus-
tralia Ltd. suggested they might have
an interesting post for him in San
Diego, California, where his daughter
was at university.
Last week, Capella, U.S. Consul-
General for New South Wales, the
A.C.T., Lord Howe and Norfolk
Islands, and Nauru, left Sydney for
Washington and he will shortly become
Vice-President Administration for
TraveLodge Corporation of U.S.A. at
their San Diego headquarters.
In February of this year TraveLodge
Australia announced a neat deal
whereby, with the English pub-keeper,
Trust Houses Ltd., the American hotel
chain Western International Hotel Co.
and several others, they secured control
of TraveLodge Corporation.
The idea of Australian management
know-how, in motels, which were in-
vented in the mobile American society,
being exported back home, fascinated
Capella. He says that his Association
with the American serviceman’s rest
and recreation leave program in Aus-
tralia, which involves 1000 men on the
ground at any one time, or 5000 a
month, and by October to be increased
50 percent, was only peripheral to his
awakening interest in the accommoda-
tion industry.
A graduate of Syracuse University
(8.A., M.Sc.) Capella was in the U.S.
Air Force during World War 11, and
later spent 18 years in the civil service.
He entered the foreign service 12 years
ago, and .as a career diplomat has
worked in Tehran and Manila, and had
five years in Bonn as Counsellor for
Administration at the U.S. Embassy,
before coming to Australia two and a
half years ago.
MANY AUSTRALIAN entrepreneurs
who succeed in journeying the full dis-
tance through all the stages of company-
man with firms of their own creation,
are content to pocket the pay-off at the
ultimate stage of takeover and retire
into affluent oblivion, leaving their
creations to an anonymous future in
the maw of an overseas giant. Not so
Mr. William Sher, who, last year, relin-
quished control of his company, Sher
Tools Australia Ltd., in favor of an
American corporation, whose bid for
the shares gave it a 70 percent stake.
If, at 64, Mr. Sher is no longer active
in the management of the company, he
seems to be almost as busy as its chair-
man. His place as managing director
has been taken by Marcus Clark, the
former sales manager of Black and
Decker, one of Sher’s two main com-
petitors, who joined the company after
the takeover.
The roots of Mr. Sher’s relationship
with Skil, of Chicago, who took over
his creation, go back to the Olympic
Games in Melbourne 12 years ago, when
he got into discussion with Mr. Sullivan,
the corporation’s president, on the possi-
bilities of a merger. However, at that
stage of the race the Sher concern was
still a proprietary, the Red Power Tool
Company.
This dialogue was but the start of
long years of courtship, which gave Mr.
Sher plenty of time to ripen the plum
. . . which at that stage in its growth
already held much promise for Skil as
an entry route into power-tool manu-
facturers in this country. It had come a
long way since Sher, an Austrian im-
migrant, and Alec Faul had started in
partnership just before World War 11,
in unpropitious premises in Melbourne’s
Little William Street.
The demand for power tools during
the war gave it its take-off, which led
to a big factory at Collingwood and
its foundry in Malvern, where, all told,
it now employs upward of 300 people.
Bill Sher still has a sizable minority
interest.
His course in engineering at Mel-
Basil Capella
William Sher
bourne University (he is a member of
the Graduates Association), undertaken
at an age well above most undergradu-
ates, and his flair for the subjects prac-
tised as well as engineering design (he
designed and patented most of the
company’s best-selling tools), are
matched by his ardent desire to see the
company get bigger and better under
Skil auspices, something which is in
fact happening. Sales have expanded
considerably since the takeover, and
product variety has been widened with
the addition of a number of new tools
from the range of the U.S. parent. Big
advances are also being made in what
was already a considerable export busi-
ness. This side is being developed to
the point where it is envisaged that
a fifth of the company’s output will be
sold overseas.
Engineering runs in the Sher blood.
The chairman’s only son, Ron, is also
an engineering graduate, and is currently
the company’s engineering director. The
father sticks pretty close to his pro-
fession as a member of the Institute
of Machine Tools, but also finds time
for his work as a Rotarian. j

Speculator’s Diary
NOT ALL BACKDOOR
LISTINGS HAVE
LACKED DISTINCTION
FROM NICKEL MINES to oil finds,
nothing last week seemed to please
that fickle creature, the Stock Market.
The Czech crisis served to show up the
underlying nervousness, as did the report
that Broken Hill’s four mines would
close down unless unions relax their
go-slow orders. I’ll be keeping an eye
on “The Barriers,” bearing in mind
that the time to buy Mount Isa was
during that company’s long, sad strike.
My first purchase this week was 400
Osti. The strong rise in the company’s
shares over the past week or so has
accompanied an amount of publicity
about its production of “paper panties”
in conjunction with Bolton Textile Mills
of the U.K. As pointed out in the
Sunday Telegraph (August 18), the 5/-
stg. shares of the latter company, so far
this year, have moved from below par
to £3. This is a measure of British in-
vestors’ confidence in the potential of
cellulose-fibre fabrics.
One further thought: the textile indus-
try is characterised by relatively low
returns on assets, and Osti might appeal
as a suitable vehicle in rationalising the
industry.
“Backdoor” listings have generally
been treated warily by investors, and
indeed there have been a number of
undistinguished operations over the
years. On the other hand, the rewards
have often been great, and even Slater
Walker entered the lists this way
through what was then Wancol. Simi-
larly, shareholders in Hestia, Kolotex,
Pongrass, Sydney Holdings and, to
stretch a point, Big Sister (or even
Union Carbide) have had little 'cause
for complaint.
A group closely associated with the
Hestia operation several years ago
moved into the P. K. Masonry shell
and this is. now the very successful
Progress and Properties, which last
year earned nearly 50 percent on capital
and, I understand, this year promises
to do even better from its home-unit
developments. But the stock which
caught my eye was the one alphabeti-
cally above Progress and Properties on
the Sydney list, Production Plant, which
is similar in many ways to Progress
and Properties, although about a year
behind in its “rejuvenation.” Being
registered in Adelaide, listed in Sydney,
and operating in Melbourne in a field
entirely unrelated to its name, it is per-
haps understandable that the company
is not well known.
Briefly, the company is engaged in
home-unit development, and following
the acquisition of a controlling interest
by Messrs. Hellinger and Zausner in
March last year, acquired from these
two gentlemen certain development and
k investment properties and, most impor-
tantly, their not inconsiderable skill in
land development. In the period of
less than four months trading to June,
1967, the company earned a net profit
after tax of $22,000 after deducting
nearly $6OOO for expenses incurred
prior to the date trading operations
were commenced. This, therefore, is
equivalent to an anual earning rate of
about 30 percent on paid capital.
The company issued a buoyant
interim report telling of higher profits.
With continued strength in flat building
in Melbourne, I have every confidence
in the full rehabilitation of the company
and bought 500.
My remaining purchase this week
was of an old favorite of mine,
Hanimex. Hanimex has been described
as one of the most misunderstood com-
panies listed on Australian stock
exchanges. Essentially, I believe that the
Australian investor adopts a defeatist
attitude and simply will not accept
that an Australian company can sell
photographic equipment overseas. Yet
Hanimex does, and, in fact, about half
its turnover is earned overseas, and
sales continue to increase at a rapid
rate —in the six months to December
total sales rose by over 15 percent over
the previous corresponding period.
Profits increased at an even faster
rate, by nearly 25 percent, and I believe
that this performance has been at least
repeated in the second half of the finan-
cial year. Certain doubts have been
raised as to the effects of sterling deval-
uation on profits, but continued growth
of sales should more than counter-
balance this. Furthermore, the continued
export drive and subsequent tax con-
cessions allowed under the recently
renewed Export Tax Incentive Scheme
means that Hanimex is one company
least affected by the recent increase in
company taxation. I bought 200.
I paid for my purchase with some of
my Slater Walker scrip, making a
profit of $450 on that proportion of my
holding, and also decided to let my
Basin Oil go at a profit of $137.
This leaves Kitty at $132.

BRIEFLY
The economy Industrial production continued to forge
ahead impressively in the three months to the end of July.
Reserve Bank Governor Phillips said in the annual report
that, if Australia fails to attract sufficient capital to cover
the national trading deficit in the next few years, it may have
to accept slower economic growth.
The J percent increase on fixed bank deposits swung an
extra $33 million for this form of investment in July.
The markets .* After early nervousness, Australian share
markets recovered their aplomb on the strength of the
philosophy that the Czech crisis is nothing to do with us.
ACI shed 30c to $3.20, but Burns Philp gained 42c to
$5.50, Osti 87c to $2.65, and Slater Walker put on a sterling
$1.50 to $9.70. As usual the .miners were the more
glamorous, with Boulder putting on $l.BO to $l9, Norseman
$1.70 to $13.20, Metals Ex. $1.90 to $10.90, and Ac,mex
40c to $4.30. The heavyweights BHP, CRA, and WMG
slipped a little and oils generally were dull despite hydro-
carbon shows offshore W.A. as well as Bass Strait.
There was a special sale of 100,000 Mt. Lyell shares
at $2.18, 7c below Tuesday’s close.
The Hobart and Launceston exchanges have decided
to merge.
The 500 index barrier has been broken by London,
where Czechoslovakian worries only seemed to emphasise
the strength of equities.
Wall Street also kept Czechoslovakia in proportion,
although in rather subdued activity. /
Companies * The long-awaited Courage Breweries public
issue will be made at par late in September, when produc-
tion will start at Broadmeadow. The issue of 3.4 million
50c shares will bring paid capital to $5.7 million. ACl’s
first local competitor is expected to join the public lists
before the year’s end, with initial capital of $2O million,
and productive capacity 25 percent of ACl’s.
Mauri Bros, and Thomson pulled out steady
but upped the dividend from 10£ to 11 percent and
declared a one-for-four bonus . . . Devaluation of sterling
deflated Berlei’s profits for the year to June . . . Osti
Holdings proposes to make a takeover offer to clothing and
textile group Gentex.
Engineer ANI made partial profit recovery and made the
biggest handout to shareholders in years with an 8 percent
dividend. It plans to reorganise the company’s structure . . .
Repco earned virtually steady profit in the year to June,
after five years of solid gains . . . Sydney BMC distributor
Larke Consolidated lifted profits to a record $704,000 . . .
Sydney Holden dealer C. V. Holland lifted dividend from
8 to 10 percent for the year to June last . . . while
Newcastle Holden dealer McLeod, Kelso, and Lee also
did rather better.
A newly formed Australian offshoot of Dickinson Robinson
of U.K. will make a $5.5 million offer for McLaren
Industries of Melbourne . . . F. H. Faulding earned frac-
tionally .more . . . A. R. C. Industries dropped a little,
but held the 8f percent dividend.
Queensland Television increased profit 55 percent to
$291,000, in a year when capital was halved . . . Tasmanian
TV improved profit 17.7 percent, to give earning rate of
40.5 percent on capital . . . Newcastle Broadcasting and
Television pushed dividend from 20 to 30 percent when
earnings rose $90,136 to $428,682 . . . and Television
Broadcasters, in Adelaide, returned with a 5 percent
dividend in overcoming the 1966-67 loss . . . but Associated
Broadcasting Services of Victoria earned rather less.
The first four months of Permewan’s current year
brought 10.6 percent better sales . . . Philip Morris’ U.S.
parent has made a bid for Godfrey Phillips’ U.K. parent,
but the Australian operations of both companies are expected
to remain separate . . . Swans restored portion of its
reduced dividend, when profit doubled to 7.7 percent
on capital.
Australia’s second nickel mine will open at Scotia,
Great Boulder and North Kalgurli announced. They said
drilling to date indicated reserves of nickel sulphide ore
of 1.25 million tons, averaging 3.07 percent nickel. Initial
production is planned at 10,000 tons a month.
Conwest Exploration outlined another nickel lode at
Boucher, near Coolgardie, which is surrounded by
CRA-Anaconda’s temporary reserve . . . Amad links with
Kennecott of the U.S. to look for minerals in the Kalgoorlie-
Kambalda district.
The Orlando and Juno gold mines and the newly
acquired Mount Morgan provided Peko-Wallsend with
the means to strike its best result to date, a profit of $4.2
million; it was revealed that Mount Morgan Ltd.
was incurring losses when Power Mining and Peko-
Wallsend were battling to take it over late last year, since
working lower-grade ore resulted in a loss of $175,000
for the first half, but this was recouped by a profit of
$1.03 million in the July half.
CGFA increased dividend from 10 to 11 percent; follow-
ing an increase in profit from iron-ore operations
profit rose 31 percent to $5.4 million . . . The four Barrier
mines are operating at a loss and may be forced to close
down unless unions relax their go-slow orders.
For a change, Silver Valley said the Japanese report
of a deal to develop the Newcastle coal prospect was
premature . . . King Island Scheelite attracts an unnamed
party with view partial takeover . . . Esso-BHP had

THE LAND
How to broaden rural extension services
WHEN the Duke of Edinburgh was
out here to open the Ninth International
Grasslands Congress, he commented:
“I am inclined to believe that no
scientific "organisation is doing its job
properly unless it takes a very active
interest in the application of its find-
ings. It is very tempting to turn out
results and expect someone else to do
something about them. We have all
heard the heart-cry of the agricultural
scientist that farmers are stick-in-the-
muds and refuse to apply scientific
knowledge. I am slightly on the
farmers’ side in this. It is one thing to
perfect a laboratory experiment, but
quite another thing to integrate it into
the operations of a mixed farm, where
grassland is only one aspect of the
farming business.”
The Duke’s heart is obviously in
the right place, but he is naive in
expecting scientists to concern them-
selves in any serious degree with the
social and economic utility (if any)
of their researches. Science has
created a world of its own, complete
with its own social and economic
system which rewards its inhabitants
according to its own sense of values.
A scientist can reach the pinnacle of
his profession without ever doing
anything that has the slightest
significance in the outside world of
toiling, and making, and raising. By
the same token, it is quite common
to find, in this topsy-turvy world of
science, people whose pay and status
are toward the bottom end of the
scale yet whose discoveries, when em-
ployed in the world of production, are
worth millions of dollars a year.
Indeed, this odd state of affairs often
finds its fullest expression in that part
of the scientific world which is
occupied by agricultural scientists.
Agricultural research is largely car-
ried on outside farmers’ control and,
until comparatively recent times, often
in the face of opposition by farmers.
Governments have always supplied the
bulk of support for agricultural research
because its fruits feed the mass of
voters more often than the farmers
themselves. Yet farming has become
heavily dependent upon scientific
research and technological develop-
ment. These contrary circumstances
provide the setting for the persistent
and generalised problem: how to get
scientific findings into agricultural prac-
tice with maximum effect and minimum
delay.
The U.S. grasped this nettle over 50
years ago, and for its boldness has been
rewarded by becoming the most power-
ful nation on earth. Congress passed
the illustrious Smith-Lever Act in 1914
“. . . to aid in diffusing among the
people of the United States useful and
practical information on subjects rela-
ting to agriculture and home economics,
and to encourage the application of
same.”
Especially notable is the fact that
the Act is addressed to all the people
and not merely the farmers. This Act
breathed a similar spirit of co-operation
into the non-rural sector of the nation,
with the result that many abiding and
fruitful marriages were made between
science and manufacturing industries.
To implement the Act a special
organisation was established (the Co-
operative Agricultural Extension Ser-
vice) to bridge the void between the
two worlds of science and farming.
Because of its success the original Act
was amended and extended about ten
years ago. Many other countries as far
apart as Britain and Japan have taken
similar purposive measures to provide
their farmers with a continuing informal
system of vocational education which
starts where the classroom stops. In
point of fact the Americans get their
people acquainted with the extension
service while they are still youngsters
at school through the 4-H Clubs.
Upward of 22 million people have now
graduated from these clubs to join the
more loosely affiliated membership of
the extension service. These people
are ready to meet change when it comes
because they are in an educational
environment. They are not simply
fed isolated snippets of information as
our farmers are. And where the
change is so great that young people
have to leave farming, the extension
service is so broad in its interests and
aims that it can help them by special
training to find better non-farm employ-
ment.
The Menzies Government in 1963
began to shuffle in this general direc-
tion. In his policy speech that year the
Prime Minister declared: “We are pre-
pared to work with State Governments,
which have major responsibilities in this
field, and to consider in a helpful way
the need and scope for further Com-
monwealth assistance to Agricultural
Extension Services. We regard the
whole matter of extension services as of
major importance to higher production
and lower costs.” As an aside we might
mention here that the American exten-
sion service is a much more human
thing. Its enshrined objective is:
“. . . the development of the people
themselves to the end that they, through
their own initiative, may effectively
identify and solve the various problems
directly affecting their welfare.”
Little has happened since Sir Robert
made his fine pronouncement, but a
book appeared last week which could
very well puff his spark of interest
into a flame. It is entitled “Agricul-
tural Extension,” written by Professor
D. B. Williams, and published by the
Melbourne University Press (218
pages, price $6.90). This small book
deserves to be read by every farmer
and everybody honestly interested in
the welfare of farmers.
The book contains a lot of highly
infla'mmatory material, although it is
usually presented with great circum-
spection. Professor Williams is clearly
a diplomat, who, as everybody knows,
is a person who can tell a man that he
is open-minded when he actually
means hq has a hole in the head. But
every now and again he tells a straight
story and comes out into the open.
For instance, on page 156 he com-
plains about our “narrow concept of
extension with much emphasis on tech-
nique, little on management, and
virtually none on education”; “lack
of problem orientation in many re-
search programs”; and “what small
leadership there has been from the
profession of agricultural science has
been largely dissipated in a complex
maze of interacting interests . . .”
Truly, there’s a lot of understanding to
be gained by reading this good book.

LIVELY TIMES
AHEAD FOR
NICKEL SPECULATORS
MINING « SECURITY ANALYSIS • BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS # THE MARKETS • OIL TABLE
NOW THAT Australia’s second nickel
mine has been formally announced
there are plenty of guesses as to the
third. The next few weeks should give
speculators plenty of scope, as during
this period there should be eagerly
awaited reports from several companies,
amongst which will be a report on the
CRA-New Broken Hill-Anaconda
group’s Higginsville area, another from
Metals Exploration on its Nepean pros-
pect, one from Acmex, and perhaps one
from Norseman Gold Mines on pre-
liminary results from its drilling pro-
gram which started a few weeks ago.
These reports are, of course, what the
nickel boom has been about; already
there is the example of Great Boulder’s
success, and the outcome of the drill-
holes which are being sunk by the com-
panies mentioned above will have, per-
haps, a significance greater than it
deserves. The market for the com-
panies referred to, as well as many
others, is obviously geared to early
success, or at least some indication that
the various leases held are not just so
much grazing land for goats.
Coming so soon after Great Boulder’s
very successful drilling results at Scotia,
an indication of commercial nickel by
any company will be sure to move
share prices considerably, and on the
other hand should the expected
announcements contain only mediocre
results, the likely disappointment will
probably be overdone.
The way markets closed last week, it
was obvious that good things are
expected in the not too distant future
from Norseman, Metals Exploration,
and Acmex, the directors of which
issued a statement denying all rumors,
whatever they were. One rumor which
they would not be in a position to
confirm or deny, but which concerns
their company’s shares, is that Metals
Exploration has had some more good
results from its efforts at Nepean,
south of Coolgardie. In addition to
Anaconda (in conjunction with CRA
and New Broken Hill), Acmex holds a
lease bordering on Metals Exploration’s
area, and regardless of any progress on
its own areas, the company stands to
be sought after should news on the
Nepean prospect be encouraging.
In April and May this year Metals
Exploration gave details of some very
encouraging intersections. One hole
struck a length of 4.7 feet assaying
5.37 percent nickel while another, four
hundred yards away, encountered 10
percent nickel over 1.8 feet of a larger
mineralised intersection. In one of these
holes the now-familiar pattern of two
ore-bodies, one above the other, was
apparent. Since that time the company
has had three drills working in the
area, which is held 50 percent by
Metals Exploration and 50 percent by
Freeport Sulphur (which itself owns a
30 percent interest in Metals Explora-
tion’s share capital). On the results
which have been obtained so far, there
is every reason to be optimistic about
the nature of any forthcoming report
from the company on this prospect.
Metals Exploration already has the
large low-grade lateritic nickel deposit
at Greenvale in North Queensland (also
in conjunction with Freeport), which is
said to be almost assured as a com-
mercial operation. With 7.75 million
shares the company has not the tight
capitalisation of companies like Great
Boulder or Acmex, but offsetting this
it has an interest in two very promising
prospects.
Good news concerning the Nepean
area would also up-grade prospects for
the Anaconda-CRA-New Broken Hill
group’s adjacent lease as well as for
Acmex, but in addition to its lease here,
Acmex is very well suited to benefit
from good news from several different
locations. It has leases near Higgins-
ville, where Anaconda - CRA - New
Broken Hill encountered nickel ore
assaying 11 percent, it holds a lease
close to the area where Norseman is
currently drilling, while other leases it
holds, although of modest acreages, are
all in strategic positions, forming a very
rough circle around the Coolgardie-
Kalgoorlie - Kambalda - Higginsville
area. With only 2.2 million shares
issued, the company is a prime target
for nickel speculators, who now have the
prospect before them of Norseman
Gold, whose one million shares have
managed to reach $13.00 even before
the results of initial drilling have come
to hand.
And of course, there are Great
Boulder and North Kalgurli.
News of Great Boulder-North Kal-
gurlie’s Scotia development was
released last week impeccably, but
news of equal importance to Great
Boulder dribbled out in a remarkably
piecemeal manner,
The 'market for several days failed
to appreciate its significance. At Mount
Martin, Great Boulder’s Fimiston
crushing-operation company plans to
develop mining simultaneously with
Scotia. In this development Great
Boulder will not be partnered by
North Kalgurli, but a 20 percent profit
f rom the ‘ mining operation goes to
Hampton Properties in return for
rights to this pre-federation freehold
land, location 45.
Scotia will be mined at 10,000-ton
monthly throughput, and Mount
Martin at 5000 tons. Perth’s “Daily
News” made the announcement on
Monday afternoon but without directly
attributing it to Great Boulder’s chair-
'man. On the following morning, the
“West Australian” headlined Mount
Martin plans on the finance page,
again without attribution, and simul-
taneously the “Financial Review” whose
correspondent had picked out the “Daily
THE CHARTIST SAYS; SWAN BREWERY appears to be continuing its
long-term uptrend, and is obviously still in a growth phase after a 30 percent
uptrend which commenced in 1960 and continued until early 1965, when prices
fell to a low of $2.20 (before the adjustment for the bonus issue). This became
a strong support level and consolidation took place with a “false” breakout about
the middle of 1966, and was followed by further consolidation above the support
level. The stock has recently broken out of a congestion area on very high volume,
which suggests that prices could eventually move up to approximately the $5.75
level. Last sale price on 22/8/68 —$3.30.

News” paragraph, used it as if it were
speculation and not firm fact.
Another important announcement
was overlooked. North Kalgurli’s chair-
man and Great Boulder director Edgar
Elvey confirmed facts, saying that the
company was feeling its way in devel-
opment, but aimed at a 400 ft. level
where it was planned to step out from
the deepened shaft. Mount Martin
holds narrow but particularly rich
sulphides, which could well provide
lucrative early pickings for Great
Boulder.
Reserves at Scotia of 1,250,000
tons are sufficient for about ten
years’ mining, but with the old gold
mining mill at Fimiston available for
crushing and treatment purposes, they
are more than sufficient for a commer-
cial operation. The hole currently be-
ing drilled at Scotia will be of parti-
cular interest as it could well increase
reserves substantially. The first drill
holes showed that the slope of the ore-
body steepened considerably at depth,
but in addition to this it also indicated
that at deeper levels the size of the
mineralised zone could be greatly in-
creased. In drill hole SDB a 60ft. core
was taken averaging 3.54 percent nickel,
and the deep hole was to test the ore-
body at a depth of 1500 ft. Should this
hole confirm the hypothesis that the ore-
body will be much larger at a greater
depth, the present outlook for the Scotia
operation will change substantially,
Present reserves are all at relatively
shallow depths, and would not involve
very large sums (relatively speaking)
for mine development and shaft sinking,
etc. Should the two companies en-
counter a massive ore deposit at 1500 ft.
or thereabouts, the estimates of produc-
tion from the area would have to be
increased, as a far larger operation
would then become warranted,
A recent estimate of profitability for
the Scotia mine has been made by the
Cowan Investment Survey based on the
initial announcement of annual ore pro-
duction of around 130,000 tons and
again at 600,000 tons, which would be a
likely figure should the deposit turn out
to be -a substantial at depth. Using
an average assay of 3 percent nickel
for ore treated and a recovery rate of
80 percent, Cowans estimate that output
of nickel in concentrates would be
3120 tons on the initial rate of produc-
tion. At $l2OO per ton this would bring
in gross revenue of $3,744,000 from
which treatment, freight, and deprecia-
tion would take $16.00 per ton, a total
of $2,080,000. Royalties to the Jones
family have been estimated at $83,200
to leave some $1.5 million (assuming
no tax) to be divided between the two
companies in the proportions 51 percent
Great Boulder and 49 percent North
Kalgurli. On this basis profits would
be equivalent to about 19 cents per
Great Boulder sha t e and 18 cents per
North Kalgurli share. At the higher
production figure of 600,000 tons of ore
per year, the same calculations give per
share earnings of 90 cents for Great
Boulder and 85 cents per North
Kalgurli share. It should be re-
membered that Great Boulder is to
mine the ore-body at Mount Martin,
too, and this operation will not be
shared with North Kalgurli, nor will the
royalties be of the same magnitude.
Certainly on these estimates, the
shares in both companies appear to
still have some scope for further price
increases, especially should the current
drill hole justify present hopes of a very
large ore-body.
CAPITALISATION
DIZZY SPELLS
IN ITS CURRENT neuroses, the
market continues to pay little attention
to favorable developments at home, but
fails to contain itself at the news of
international crisis. By the close of the
week it had managed to recover very
little of the loss which the invasion of
Czechoslovakia had quite ' unneces-
sarily precipitated on Wednesday. But
the good news on Australia’s second
nickel mine and plenty of hope for
more oil went for next to nothing.
In some ways it is only growing pains.
The market capitalisation of the .major
mining companies is now so big, by
Australian standards, that bouts of ver-
tigo are to be expected. Extraordinary
propulsion is now required to raise
prices of the big companies from their
already high plateau to new peaks.
Ordinary propulsion seems to do them
little good, but rather boosts the market
evaluation of their smaller neighbors.
Western Mining, for example, con-
tinues to hover around $912 million,
despite a healthy quarterly report, which
obviously indicated that reserves were
far in excess of the out-dated estimate
of 9.3 million tons that would give
the shares an evaluation of some $BOO
million, leaving $lOO million to account
for its gold and iron-ore interest, its
20 percent interest in Alcoa of Aus-
tralia, and a wide-spread prospecting
program which has already come up
with a taste of copper. It would not be
absurd at all to suggest that the com-
pany’s last report indicates reserves of
nickel to be nearer an arbitrary 70
million tons at a value of $5OOO million.
So there is obviously plenty of room for
the company’s shares to appreciate con-
siderably, but not until the company
sees fit to revise its estimated reserves
accordingly.
What Western Mining’s last report
did do, however, was to concentrate
interest on the tiny neighboring leases
of Norseman and Ravensthorpe, and
double the markets evaluation of them.
By the end of last week the market had

AUSTRALIAN CONSOLIDATED INDUSTRIES LIMITED
Registered Office: 550 BOURKE STREET, MELBOURNE, VICTORIA
Address of the Chairman of Directors (Sir James Forrest) at the Annual
General Meeting of Shareholders on Wednesday, 21st August, 1968.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Following our usual practice at the Annual Meeting of Shareholders, I
shall now address you briefly on the affairs of the Company, but before
doing so wis.h to mention some personal items.
During the year, two former Directors of this Company died. I refer
to Mr. A. E. Smith and Mr. C. N. McKay. Both were valuable members
of the Board in their day and, in addition, Mr. Smith served as General
Manager for many years. They were well known to many shareholders and
I am sure you would wish to be recorded a note of regret at their passing.
For the first time for many years, Mr. Norman Perrier is not with us
at the Annual Meeting. He regularly contributed to the proceedings of the
Meeting and we regret his death, which occurred at the close of the
Meeting last year.
Mr. John Grimwade, who is- abroad, has asked me to apologise for his
absence.
REVIEW OF ACCOUNTS
Now, I shall refer to the 1968 Annual Report, which, no doubt, you
will have perused since it was sent to you last month.
The 1968 Group Net Profit, based on rates of income tax known at
the time of closing the accounts for the year, was 510,575,000. Since then,
as you know, Australian company tax rates have risen by 21/2 cents in
the dollar; effectively, an increase of nearly 6%. in the amount of tax
payable. The result is to reduce the profit figure by 5250,000 to 510,325,000,
which compares with 511,061,000 for last year. Devaluation of the currency
by New Zealand adversely affected the year’s result by 5574,000. Share-
holders will be interested to know that of the total profit of 510,325,000
for 1968, 56,553,000 was earned from Australian sources and 53,772,000
from overseas, comprising 52,304,000 from New Zealand, 5823,000 from
Malaysia/Singapore, and 5645,000 from Thailand.
Maintaining earnings is a continuing problem everywhere because of
rising costs and now taxes. Last year, I referred to the way in which
costs had increased since March, 1967. This trend continued and made it
necessary to raise the prices of some of our products in the latter part
of the financial year.
The proportion of 1968 income due to outside shareholders in partly
owned suDsidiary companies was reported at 51,055,000. Due to the
additional income tax, this sum is reduced to 51,035,000 and it compares
with 51,192,000 for the previous year. The downturn arose from the reduced
profits of Malayan Containers Berhad and Australian Window Glass
Proprietary Limited, both of which, as you know, have outside share-
holders.
The various relationships between assets and liabilities which reflect
the financial strength of the Group are clearly discernible from the
Consolidated Balance Sheet on pages 10 and 11 of the Report. There is
no need for me to dwell on this aspect of the Balance Sheet, so I shall
confine my comments to several other specific items.
Shareholders’ Funds at the end of the year, it will be noted, stood
at 5112,059,000 in the total of 5184,476,000 for all funds employed in the
business of the Company. The increase in Shareholders’ Funds for the
year was 5708,000 after taking into account the reduction of 52,658,000
arising from the New Zealand currency devaluation to which reference is
made in the Directors’ Report at page 5. It should be pointed out that
this reduction is more a consequence of record than anything else because
in local New Zealand terms, the value of the assets to which it relates
has not changed, and indeed it can be said that the book values on which
the adjustment rests are quite conservative in relation to current market
replacement values.
The item “Stocks of all Kinds” is shown on the Balance Sheet at
532,257,000 after the deduction of provisions set aside for fluctuations in
stock values, which is covered by Note 15 to the Accounts. We will be
reviewing the accounting treatment of this item for next year and it
is quite likely that while the provisions will be maintained, the total so
set aside will be reclassified as Shareholders’ Funds.
Investments held by the Group ip outside securities show at a total
cost of 519,505,000. The market value of those items dealt in on stock
exchanges continues to be higher than cost. Included in these securities
are 1,359,000 ordinary shares in Ampol Exploration Limited, an increase
of 359,000 shares from the one (1) million I mentioned last year. During
the year the Company paid its maiden dividend. Also included in invest-
ments is our interest in Richards Coramic Pty. Ltd., which is referred
to on page 5 of the Report. Since the end of the year there has been
a merger in England between the Richards and Johnson companies which
will lead to a merging in Australia of Richards Coramic Pty. Ltd. With
H. & R. Johnson (Aust.) Pty. Ltd. The effect of this will be to broaden
the base of our investment in the ceramic tile industry.
The movement of funds during the year within the Group is set out
concisely in the Statement of Sources and Application of Funds on page 16.
It shows the effect of increased activity which resulted in a further
52,881,000 being put into stocks. Partly for the same reason and also
because of some slowing down in customer settlements, a further 53,451,000
was used in financing trade and other debtors. The Statement shows also
the large expenditure of 516,577,000 on capital items necessary for the
continuing up-dating and expansion of our production facilities both in
Australia and overseas.
SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES
In the published Annual Report, the operations of the subsidiaries for
1968 financial year were reviewed by the General Manager. References
were made to several expansions or new activities to which I shall now refer
along with other matters of interest in our various operations since the
end of March.
The investigation into the feasibility of manufacturing glass containers
and corrugated fibreboard containers at Lae, in the Territory of Papua
and New Guinea, showed scope for setting up a works there on a modest
scale. Planning and design work has started and the aim is to be in
production late In 1969 or early in 1970. Both the activities we plan to
carry on are now declared pioneer industries and our subsidiary, New
Guinea Containers Pty. Ltd., has been granted a pioneer certificate for
corrugated fibreboard and has made application for one in respect of
glass. Pioneer status is designed to encourage industry in the Territory and
amongst other things grants exemption from income tax for up to five years.
In Malaysia, the new glass container manufacturing plant of Kuala
Lumpur Glass Manufacturers Company Sendirian Berhad commenced
operations on schedule early in June this year and almost from the first
day production was of high commercial quality. This was a notable achieve-
ment and we had much pleasure in congratulating the Company employees
who helped to bring it about. We acknowledge also the co-operation
received from various Departments of the Malaysian Government, particularly
the Ministry of Commerce and Industry. The factory was opened officially
on 31st July by the Malaysian Minister of Commerce and Industry,
Dr. Lim Swee Aun. The opening function was attended by important
guests and was most successful. Business offering for the new company is
good and orders already in hand will keep it busy for some time. As
mentioned last year, the new company is a subsidiary of Malayan
Containers Berhad, in which our Company has an interest of 51.7%< and
the investing public of Malaysia and Singapore 48.3%. Funds for the
new operation were mainly from internal resources.
Construction of the new glass furnace at Thai Glass Manufacturers in
Bangkok is complete and fire was put into it on last Saturday week. All
being well, it will be producing glass containers this Friday, 23rd August.
This will be another creditable achievement. The new capacity which
represents about a further 50%i increase on what we have there already,
will enable the Company to satisfy the growing demand and have some-
thing in reserve for a reasonable time.
?P eakl . 1 ’? of South-East Asia, I should mention having visited
® a J ler . thls year in the company of the General Manager. In
addition to inspecting our factories and seeing members of our staff in
° wn ® nv ' r . onm ent, we were able to have most useful discussions with
Government officers, customers, and others with whom we have dealings We
were thus able to form some first-hand impressions which, for the present
' n y ’ are - f avo “rable. There are problems in the area, but given
reasonable economic and political stability, there is every reason to look
forward with confidence. On the way back, we visited Indonesia, where
business opportunities are beginning to open up again.
Our association with St. Regis Paper Company of New York continues
to , the mutual benefit of both companies. As you know, St. Regis is a
substantial shareholder in our subsidiary Amalgamated Packaging Pty Ltd
and there were one or two developments during the year as mentioned in
the pubhshed Report. Soon after ACI-St. Regis (N.Z.) Ltd. became a
subsidiary (referred to in the Directors’ Report) it became an equal
shareholder with N.Z. Forest Products Limited in a new company called
Paper Coaters Limited in New Zealand. This is an enterprise with consider-
able promise in the specialised field of polyethelyne coated boards which have
a variety of uses including packaging. Incidentally, it is quite possible that
St. Regis will join us in our corrugated fibreboard carton project in
New Guinea. Close personal liaison between our Company and St. Regis
is maintained at senior management and technical levels. Recently, their
N ew U 'zesfla ncL rGS * d€nt> lnte ™ational Division, visited us in Australia and
The Directors' Report refers also to the acquisition of Martin Printing
Co. Ltd., whose printing activities are integrating readily into our packaging
operations in New Zealand. There are good prospects for further growth
and expansion by this company.
Last year, I referred to plans for major expansion in the operations
of Australian Fibre Glass Pty. Ltd. You will know from our Press
announcement and from the Annual Report that the plans are complete
and we are on the way with the large project of setting up a direct
melt textile facility. The work is proceeding at Dandenong and will be
adjacent to and integral with the factory already there. Altogether it will
represent an investment of some 54 million. It will be of the most modern
design and constructed in such a way that significant expansion can take
place when needed. The initial output of fibre glass will be considerably
more than our present production. Our partners in fibre glass, Owens
Corning Fiberglas Corporation of Toledo, U.S.A., are participating actively
in this venture. The project is to their design and has been proven in
North America and in Europe.
Recently Australian Fibre Glass Pty. Ltd. acquired a majority interest
in Reinforced Plastics Pty. Ltd., a company engaged in the building of
large units out of fibre glass reinforced plastics of which motor truck
bodies and cabs and insulated pantechnicons for frozen food transport are
examples. Another interesting example is the installation of visual guidance
systems for the Department of Civil Aviation. The move into reinforced
plastics is associated with a new department at Australian Fibre Glass
set up to develop and stimulate the use of fibre glass in new applications.
Working arrangements with Pilkington Brothers Limited, our partners
in flat glass operations here and in New Zealand, continue in the satisfactory
way to which we have become accustomed. Again this year we had inter-
changes of ideas and personal contacts both here and in England. We
were all very pleased with the news in January last that Sir Harry Pilkington,
as he was then, had been honoured with a life peerage and so became
Lord Pilkington.
Since March, A. W G. Holdings Pty. Ltd. has acquired a majority
interest in the Seraphic Group of Companies. They operate in Adelaide,
where they make various ceramic printed and decorative industrial and
domestic items out of toughened flat glass. Their market is Australia-wide
and in a modest way, as yet, overseas.
As shareholders will be aware, we have over the last three or four
years been engaging in long-term appraisal and planning of the Group's
activities involving some disposals and redeployment of resources. The
basic approach is greater concentration of effort in the glass and other
packaging and building materials areas of our enterprise. Earlier this year
we sold the two bright steel businesses which we had carried out in
Sydney and Brisbane. The buyer was Martin Bright and the
terms were mutually satisfactory. Our bright steel operation in Melbourne,
carried on by Bruntons Bright Steel Company, has been retained. As you
Will see from the Directors’ Report, our association with Chicago Bridge &
Iron Company has been determined and Johns and Waygood Perry Engineer-
ing Limited, with whom we already had some interests in common, became
our equal partners in David Lennox Australia Pty. Ltd.
The Technical Centre, whose services are in great demand by the operating
companies, has changed its status to that of a separate company so that
it would have a corporate identity of its own. It is now called A.C.I.
Technical Centre Pty. Ltd., uses assets of some $ll/2 million and has a
highly qualified staff under Dr. Alan Draycott. It has become one of the
select establishments in Australia which are approved research organisations
for the purposes of the Industrial Research and Development Grants Act.
At some time in the future it may set up laboratories in Melbourne. We
have some land not far from Monash University which would be suitable
for the purpose.
A new law of importance to commerce industry came into being
during the year. I refer to the Trade Practices Act, which, in one way or
another, affected every company in the Group operating in Australia. We
have done all that needs to be done to comply with the requirements for
registration of agreements and have gone to some trouble to ensure
continuing surveillance of practices and agreements throughout the Group.
Our agreements or practices do not cause us concern and we are happy
to meet and co-operate with the Commissioner at any time on any of them.
For a few months now, we have been ' aware of market surveys and
associated enquiries being made by at least one organisation, with overseas
connections, into the possibility of setting up glass container manufacture
in Australia. More recently, we have heard that plans arising out of
these enquiries are developing to set up operations in Sydney and Melbourne.
There has also been some suggestion that operations might extend to
Adelaide. We are confident of our ability to handle problems which may
arise from these developments. It is timely to reiterate what shareholders
have known for a long time; that Is that Company policy and practice
has been and still is to have manufacturing capacity of world standard
(with some in reserve) to be able to supply all glass container needs
of all customers all the time. In view of this, there seems to be little
need for even the minimum amount of capacity which a new enterprise
would have to install to justify its establishment.
CAPITAL RAISING
Last week you will have read of our plan to raise capital by means
of an issue of ordinary shares for cash on the basis of 1:5 at a premium
of 80c per share. The proceeds will be applied to financing the projects
referred to before in this address, continuing the Company policy of
up-dating plant and machinery and providing working capital. It will be
nearly two months before the books close to determine shareholder entitle-
ments and after that there will be some six weks of trading in rights
before the first instalment of 51 per share becomes payable on 30th
November. The other 80c per share will be payable on 30th September,
1969. We believe that we have made available adequate time for share-
holders to make their plans to deal with the offer. In due course we
shall send out a circular giving full details. You will note also that on
this occasion we are arranging to offer up to 250,000 shares at the same
51.80 per share to employees. It is our hope that this offer will be taken
up readily by our employees right through the Company.

put a combined value of nearly $24
million on a project which has yet to
prove something of interest.
TRANSPORT
A GOOD SMALL ONE
MOST OF THE major transport
groups are tending to be rather expen-
sive buys these days, with yields rather
on the low side, too. But the field has
certainly proved well worth investor
interest, so perhaps it’s a good idea to
look among some of the smaller com-
panies which may have an active future
ahead.
One such is Melbourne cartage con-
tractor and motor engineer Chalmers.
Unfortunately, at this moment, the 50-
cent shares are at a peak $1.20, where,
however, they still yield a fairly reason-
able 5.2 percent on the current 12-£
percent dividend. In contrast, for
example, the larger F. H. Stephens is
yielding 2.9 percent and TNT 3.2 per-
cent.
Chalmers may well be m<4re sought
after in the nearer term. Preliminary
accounts for the 1967-68 year are due
soon. They will follow a December
half-year when revenue was over 50
percent higher than the previous
corresponding period and a record
1966-67 result which produced a 24.9
percent earning rate.
The company has lately broadened
out into long-distance and interstate
haulage. An advantageous acquisition
enables the specialised handling of
pipes, beams, and bridge slabs. This
has led to contracts for the Tulla-
marine airport and the Victorian
natural gas development.
Chalmers looks like a share for quick
attention.
GOLD
COUP DE GRACE
RUNNING TRUE to its current form,
the market received Peko-Wallsend’s
record profit last week with a minor
cutback in the share price to $13.10.
Earlier in the year with its Tennant
Creek gold reserves put at 100,000 tons
of good grade ore (55dwts. a ton)'
brokers were valuing Peko’s shares at
between $l2 and $l3. In May, esti-
mated reserves were doubled to 200,000
tons of ore, and last week the group
announced a more-than-doubled profit,
an increase of $2.3 million to a record
$4.2 million. To this, the apparently
fabulous Juno gold mine at Tennant
Creek had contributed some $1.4
million although it had been in pro-
duction only for the past 36 weeks of
the year. The Queensland copper-gold
producer Mount Morgan, taken over by
Peko at the beginning of the year,
recorded a net profit of just over
$1 million for the latter half of the year,
wiping out its earlier losses incurred be-
fore the takeover and ending with a
full-year profit of $818,759 despite a
move into lower ore grades.
Admittedly, the combined profits of
Peko and Morgan in 1966-67, before
the merger, had beerl $4.5 million. But
with Juno working for 12 months and
Morgan moving on again into better
ores, 1968-69 should see a strong profit
rise, while in 1969-70 the group will
begin to feel the effects of the current
$4.5 million re-equipment program at
Mount Morgan. Profits in the region
of $lO million and more have been
predicted for next year alone.
Even in the event of the official gold
price remaining at $35 an ounce Peko’s
future seems healthy enough; if the
price were to be raised future prospects
would be splendid indeed.
The market last week presumably
discounted that possibility. The U.S.
efforts to discredit the future of gold
in the world’s monetary system are at
least proving partially successful; but
not entirely so.
Increasingly, world opinion points to
an intensification of world monetary
problems in the near future. Present
speculation centres on the French franc,
the devaluation of which during the
next six months is inevitable according
to many European sources. And the
French seem to be supporting that view:
in increasing numbers they have been
noted slipping across the border into
Switzerland to swop their money into
Swiss francs even at a discount on the
official rate; for several weeks the price
of gold in Paris has been as much as
SU.S.S per ounce above that in London
and Zurich; and gold smuggling into
France has become a profitable busi-
ness with a sickening effect on the
French economy as the money to pay
for it is smuggled out.
In London the argument goes that if
France devalues, other European coun-
tries will follow suit and the U.S., al-
ready precariously near the brink of a
recession, could topple over.
The official U.S. attempts to dis-
credit gold, strengthen the dollar, and
wipe away all fears that sterling .might
be heading for another devaluation
crisis are being met with plenty of
pessimism.
In simplest terms, the pessimists
point out that either the present short-
age of world liquidity will lead to world
recession; or the U.K. and the U.S.
will continue to pump dollars and sterl-
ing into the world monetary pool by
running balance-of-payment deficits
(that way lies bankruptcy); or the
official price of gold will have to be in-
creased (and that, the U.S. seems emo-
tionally incapable of agreeing to).
It is to be hoped, of course, that the
International Monetary Fund’s creation
of Special Drawing Rights will prove to
be at least the beginnings of a less
fearful solution to world monetary prob-
lems. Although it could be pointed out
that a rise in the official price of gold
is only fearful in the eyes of U.S.
officialdom and is the obvious solution.
NEWBOLD
GLAMOR TO COME?
THE ATTRACTIVENESS of New-
bold General Refractories’ investment
portfolio has been well played upon
in the past and has perhaps tended to
withdraw attention from the company’s
purely industrial activities. Indeed,
even this year, directors can’t avoid
the benefits from that considerable
swag of BHP and Brickworks shares,
whose marked value has been taken
into the balance sheet to yield a hand-
some surplus of $2,713,143 over cost
and that as an additional credit to
revaluation of assets reserve.
Yet there are certainly other matters
in the preliminary report, apart from
the record $896,821 profit, which may
HEAD OFFICE BUILDING
Last year I mentioned that we had settled well into this new building.
We have been in it long enough now to be able to say that it is
serving our purposes as we hoped it would. You will be interested and I
am sure pleased as we were to know that it was the subject of an award
to the Company recently granted by the Royal Australian Institute of
Architects for the best urban building for 1968.
PROSPECTS FOR THE CURRENT YEAR
For the first quarter of this financial year, profits of the Group are
ahead of the corresponding quarter of last year. Results so far are
?enerally in accordance with our forecasts except that for last month
July) we were seriously affected by industrial troubles in the transport
and fuel industries especially in New South Wales. This, coupled with the
effect of last week’s Australian Federal Budget, causes us to revise our
earlier forecast for the year and to expect now that while 1969 should
still be better than 1968, it will not be greatly so. In making this forecast,
we believe that the effect of the drought in Eastern Australia has been
contained and assume that the industrial and economic situation will
remain much as it is at present.
In New Zealand, the results for the quarter are not quite up to last
year, due mainly to cost increases which so far have not been recovered
in sales. This situation is, however, expected to be rectified and the
year’s result should be as good as 1968, allowing for some caution in
assessing prospects in New Zealand due to their earlier balance of payments
and associated internal economic problems.
For both Singapore/Malaysia and Thailand operations, profits for the
first quarter were up on last year. With increased capacity and prospects
for a good demand in both regions, the profits in the full year are
expected to be higher than 1968.
MANAGEMENT, STAFF, AND EMPLOYEES
It is my pleasure, on your behalf, Ladies and Gentlemen, and on
behalf of the Board, to convey thanks to the General Manager and all
people employed in the business of the Company both in Australia and
overseas for their good work and loyalty to the Company during the year.

go some of the way toward bringing
back a measure of Newbold’s old
glamor. Within a highly competitive
field turnover of both main products
managed a sizable rise—the monetary
value of refractories sales went up by
13 percent and that of building bricks
by more than 11 percent.
On the financial side, shareholders’
funds have risen from $8,974,774 to
$12,813,931 and the net asset value
of each 50 cent share stands at $1.31.
The directors are pleased to point out
that the balance sheet contains no
intangibles.
It’s the operational plans, though,
and future prospects that should repay
examination. Newbold’s projected re-
fractory plant at Kwinana (W.A.)
grooves in very well with the West’s
industrial expansion, particularly since
it possesses the initial advantage of
being close to the BHP’s works and to
the Alcoa aluminium set-up.
Equally well conceived is the com-
pany’s purchase of 21 acres at
Unanderra (N.S.W.), close to the
vigorously developing Port Kembla
area, for another refractories plant.
Newbold’s existing facilities, at
Thirroul (N.S.W.), Dandenong (Vic.),
and Beverley (S.A.), are well placed
and also being extended and
modernised.
These developments may receive
more comment in the annual report.
There does seem, in the near future,
room for the shares to move closer to
their 1967 and 1968 peak of $2. At
present they are available around
$1.34, where they yield 4.6 percent on
the well-covered percent dividend.

ENGINEERING SOME
LAUDABLE PROFITS FROM
THE MINING INDUSTRY
SINCE THE mining industry
accounted for a very high percentage
of Marfleet and Weight Limited’s
business in the past three or four
years, this stock warrants closer
attention and recognition beyond
Melbourne, the only Exchange on
which it is listed. For years it has
had steady business in Victorian min-
ing (doing work for the SEC at
Yallourn and Morwell) but more
recently there has been an upsurge in
its work for the mining industry in
Western Australia and Tasmania.
Marfleet and Weight has enjoyed
the increasing demand for conveyers
and materials handling, and has been
unworried by overseas competition in
these products. Australian conveyers
win on design, which is based on
local conditions, and the tariff pro-
tection here is quite adequate,
according to the company. But
Government indifference to the fate of
heavy engineering does worry the
company, and its managing director
(Mr. J. Donald) has become the first
chairman of the Heavy Engineering
Manufacturers’ Association, which
wishes to prevent erosion of current
protection. Mining equipment has
special duty privileges, either very low
rates of duty, or none at all, and
this is now under review by the
Tariff Board. In the past three years
there has been a marked increase in
wholly imported goods used in min-
ing, which in the past would have
been made locally, the company
declares.
Mining companies that are finan-
cially controlled overseas, and
especially those employing non-
Australians predominantly, tend to
look for familiar equipment, to the
neglect of the Australian product.
Some business has also been lost to
overseas suppliers because of the
delivery time factor. Generally speak-
ing, though, Marfleet and Weight has
done and is doing very well from
current mining developments. It is
now working for the Port Hedland
project of the Leslie Salt Company,
and on bucket-wheel reclaimers for the
Mt. Goldsworthy iron-ore scheme.
The 1967-68 profit (year to March)
advanced 22 percent to $242,000, but
tax will have to be adjusted by about
SIO,OOO for the new rates brought
down in the Budget. So, net improve-
Inent is more like 17 percent for the
year, and the earning rate will be
trimmed to approximately 31 percent.
This still represents very laudable pro-
gress, particularly as earning rate on
shareholders’ funds shows annual pro-
gression.
The company has no apparent
liquidity and recent growth
has been comfortably financed from
within, except for issues at 100 per-
cent premium, a one-for-four in
October 1964, and a one-for-nine back
in November 1961, and some reliance
on secured long-term loans.
The co'mpany says its sales figure
is not very meaningful, because profit
margin on the contracting side, where
much work is sub-contracted, is low,
compared with the profit margin on
the manufacturing side, for work done
in the company’s own workshop. Any-
how, for what it is worth, turnover for
1968 was revealed to be of the order
of million.
Because the company is involved with
large contracts, the turnover fluctu-
ates within the limits, and the 27 per-
cent drop in stocks and work in pro-
gress, the 15 percent drop in debtors
on last accounts, also the 35 percent

fall in trade creditors, has no special
significance.
Net additions to freehold and lease-
hold property of $281,000 and of plant,
$186,000, represent the fresh invest-
ment in the new Abbotsford buildings
for Marweight Equipment Pty. Ltd.,
adjacent to the group’s distribution
centre. (Sotne investment allowance
was available to the company, account-
ing for the drop in tax provided in
1967-68, slightly lower than standard
tax, where usually tax provided is a
whisker above theoretical tax.) The
move for Marweight Equipment from
West Melbourne gives a satisfactory
consolidation of buildings with some
savings in costs.
Although all manufacturing activi-
ties are located in Victoria, the sales
company for the group has branches
throughout Australia. The company
holds distribution and manufacturing
rights for local manufacturers and
from U.K., U.S., West German,
Swedish, and Japanese firms. It
makes or part makes all the goods
except the machine tools, for which it
has rights. A new licensing agreement
has been arranged with Verson Allsteel
Press Co. of U.S.A., under which Mar-
fleet and Weight will make mechanical
presses larger than the hydraulic presses
which it makes to its own design,
thereby providing a full range.
The parent company, operating from
Abbotsford, is one of the leaders in
Australian medium-to-heavy engineering
companies in Australia. The subsidiary,
A. Challingsworth Pty. Ltd. (acquired
July, 1959), specialises in fabrication
work and the use of constructional steels
in Richmond. Abbey Engineering Pty.
Ltd., acquired in 1963-64, makes
hydraulic hoists, stackers, and work
platforms, and engages in light engineer-
ing and fabrication work at Springvale.
Marweight Equipment Pty. Ltd. is a
design and contracting engineer, special-
ising in materials handling. It has com-
pleted large projects for the handling
of bulk ore, providing shiploaders,
conveyers, screening, and bucketwheel
equipment.
In the past, Marfleet and Weight has
supplied a $2 million coal-winning
dredger for the SEC, installed two of
the largest pumping units for the
Snowy, a haulage unit for Munmorah
State Coal Mine, a travelling ship-
loader for ilmenite at Bunbury, mobile
work platforms for the Savage River,
a stacker for iron ore for Western
Mining, and major plant for Mt.
Goldsworthy and Hamersley. It is
currently providing 32 riveted girders
for the Heyington Railway bridge,
and constructing equipment for the
South Eastern Trunk sewer. It has
contracts for the Hazelwood (Vic.)
power station up to 1970.
The tenor of business in the opening
stages of 1968-69 is much the same as
at the end of last year, with the heavy
shop and structural shop continuing to
be light on for work, while other enter*

TV-DINNERS PREPARED
FOR A
BLAST-FREEZE TAKE-OFF
STATISTICS on frozen food in the
U.S., released by Quick Frozen Foods,
showed that in 1966 consumption per
head of population amounted to 55.4
pounds, which was about double the
rate of consumption per head in Aus-
tralia. Of the U.S. figure, vegetables
represented 27 percent, poultry 20 per-
cent, prepared foods 19 percent, juices
14 percent, fish and seafood 8 per-
cent, meat 7 percent, and fruit 5 per-
cent. Institutional and catering packs
sold through hotels, restaurants, in-
dustrial canteens, schools, and hospitals
accounted for about 37 percent of the
total, with retail sales making up the
balancing 63 percent.
One of the fastest-growing sectors in
the U.S. industry is in prepared food
consisting of dinners, bakery products,
nationality foods, such as Italian-style
and Chinese-style, prepared vegetables,
entrees, meat, fruit and cream pies, sea-
food specialties, soups, pre-cooked
poultry, and vegetables, which combined
had a consumption exceeding 11.91 b.
per head of U.S. population in 1966.
One estimate about future growth, and
deemed to be conservative, was that
frozen prepareds were expected to grow
from $U.5.1.5 billion in the U.S. in
1966 to $U.5.6.8 billion in 1976, a leap
of 355 percent.
This is tremendous growth. In Aus-
tralia, the frozen-prepared market is
just taking off and one company in
the forefront is the TV-dinner pioneer
in this country, Scotts Provisions (Hold-
ings), which is the industry leader.
Scotts Gold Ribbon Heat-n-Eat TV
Dinners in retail packs, and Scotts Heat
and Serve meals for institutional users
and caterers currently constitute about
10 percent of the company’s annual
trading volume, but with an estimated
growth of 25 percent in 1969, which is
an exciting rate of expansion in any-
one’s language, frozen prepareds will
constitute an increasingly sizable pro-
portion of this group’s total business.
The quality of frozen prepareds has
shown marked improvement in very
recent years due to a changeover in
the technical process. In the previous
method, known as contact freezing,
frozen plates were placed in position on
top and on the bottom of the prepared
food in a concertina-like action; this
had the effect of conducting the freez-
ing process from the outside in. This
was a slow method of processing and
it was difficult to retain the natural
flavor and taste, so meals often tasted
bland and flat.
Scotts have,.for a considerable period,
operated the blast-freezing technique, in
which the meal is frozen in about 30
minutes, which is about 50 percent
faster than in the older contact-freez-
ing system. In this method, the freezing
is forced through the meal and natural
flavor and taste is retained. With im-
provements also in the quality of the
sauces and seasonings, it is becoming
increasingly difficult to tell the dif-
ference between some of the frozen pre-
pareds and the good old-fashioned meal
which mother used to make. Although
a little more expensive than the price
at which the housewife can pay for the
raw ingredients, frozen prepareds can be
regarded as being cheaper, if the house-
wife’s time and energy in preparation,
cooking, and washing up, calculated out
in money value, were to be taken into-
account.
In addition to frozen prepareds as
such, Scotts are particularly well
positioned to supply institutional as
well as retail requirements for all
types of frozen foods, and the company
is a large distributor of a wide range
of frozen vegetables, poultry, fish, and
seafood, which is brought in from
overseas and local suppliers. On a
composition of the group’s business,
frozen foods (including distribution
lines as well as frozen prepareds) make
up about 28 percent; whilst the
traditional smallgoods, bacon and pie
activities, represent about 55 percent;
exports 7 percent; and various activi-
ties of general catering, including those
as official caterers at the Royal Agri-
cultural Society’s Showground, as well
as Philip Lodge Motel, Ashfield
(Sydney), about 10 percent. This esti-
mate excludes the plant infeeding
facilities of the industrial-canteens
division, which operates canteens for
industry on a management-fee basis.
Scotts have their origins in a sole
trading business started in 1882 at
Darling Street, Balmain (Sydney), by
H. P. Scott, who opened a delicatessen
and shortly after commenced the
manufacture of smallgoods in a section

of the sa'me premises hygienically
conditioned and specially fitted up for
the purpose. The policy then formu-
lated that “the customer had the right
to be served with the highest quality
goods manufactured under the best
conditions” has never been altered in
the years between then and now. At
one stage, the company had a chain
of retail delicatessens and self-service
stores which built up to 18 in the
19505, but this side of the business,
from which the company has now
retired, proved to involve too heavy a
capital outlay without commensurate
returns.
All of the six stms of H. P. Scott
went into the family business, but only
one now remains in H. K. Scott (53),
who is the chairman of a relatively
young board and managing director of
the co'mpany, which listed on the
Sydney Exchange in 1959. Four of the
other five directors of the public com-
pany hold full-time executive positions
and two of these have close family
connections with the managing direc-
tor. The remaining director is a prac-
tising solicitor. The group operates a
total of five factories three in
Sydney and one each in Newcastle and
Wollongong. Total employment is
about 400 permanents and about 650
casuals, who are mainly engaged for
catering activities.
Of pies sold in the Sydney metro-
politan area, Scotts rank second in
volume. About 80 percent of these sales
are made to the traditional outlets
such as lunch shops, retail stores,
hotels, canteens, and schools, the bal-
ance going to supermarkets. Scotts pies
are also distributed in country and
interstate areas, and the company has
a substantial export market in pies and
other manufactured lines. The rate of
growth is about 10 percent per annum.
Meat still dominates as the No. 1 filler
for pies in public demand, but Scotts
have been behind the growth in variety
pies as well, in products such as
curried steak, steak and mushroom,
chicken, and (spiced beef
with cheese topping).
The Philip Lodge Motel, six miles
from Sydney GPO, on the Great
Western Highway, consists of 49 units,
with a licensed restaurant, and Scotts
say they are well pleased with the
venture.

THE ARTS
AND ENTERTAINMENT
Not perfect, but here is
Australia’s greatest gallery
By ELWYN LYNN
THE NATIONAL Gallery of Vic-
toria, the first phase in the creation
of the Victorian Arts Centre at St.
Kilda, was opened on August 20 by
the Premier of Victoria, Sir Henry
Bolte.
Mr. Roy Grounds’ creation is an
imposing, - spectacular building that
from the outside resembles an arsenal
or temple of secret rites. Inside, the
works are displayed to such breath-
taking advantage, the glassware so
sparkling in ecstasy, and the old
masters glowing so rapturously that it
seems ungrateful to begin with what
appear to me as disadvantages, especi-
ally as Mr. Grounds has 'much of the
devastating dedication, combative
vehemence, and rationale of Rodin’s
defiant Balzac, which dominates the
Central Court and which Mr. Grounds
so much resembles.
It is of little importance that the
bluestone walls, unbroken by window
or sign of life and topped with what
could be called watch-towers, look
dauntingly like those of a house of cor-
rection, for, once inside, one’s glance
into any of the three courts is met by
a dehumanised severity. The Playhouse
Court, which is now subjugating the
sculpture associated with The Field, an
exhibition of the New Abstraction, may
be suitable for Hauptmann, Beckett,
Weiss, and other dealers in doom, but
it is overmuch the prison yard with
observation verandas which made me
think of Van Gogh’s prisoners eternally
circulating without a sign of relief.
The water jets and the fragilely
decorative Japanese bamboo in the
Oriental Court hardly supply that
organic presence that the human mind
craves for. The Central Court is already
a problem: it diminishes Henry
Moore’s bulky woman om the steps;
Rodin’s Balzac on its high pedestal
rejects it; Norma Redpath’s corroded
and sweeping forms cope with it; but
Phillip King’s blue metal Stonehenge
of solid but teetering pieces looks lost.
One can hardly think of a recent sculp-
ture, except Calder’s 35ft.-long mobile
Ghost, that could give life to . these
enclosing walls.
This sense of claustrophobic space
extends to the greatest disappointment,
the Great Hall, which looks through
stepped t windows into the Central
Court; the windows are so meanly
plain that one wonders what happened
to the Sidney Nolan designs that run
from open ease at the bottom to ecstasy
at the top. The spindly shafts that
support Leonard French’s ceiling seem
singularly inappropriate to the bulk,
and increase the ceiling’s sagging inde-
terminacy. The ceiling, which is a
piece of repetitive design and no more,
is static and niggardly and passionless.
Mr. French did not have to cleave
to Baroque or Rococo notions of the
ceiling as metaphor of the heavens, as
the heavens under majestic control or
alive with frolicking, levitated gods;
he did not have to suggest a world
beyond his colored glass as do the
windows of Sainte Chapelle or Char-
tres. He did not have to rely on the
continuity of episodes as Michelangelo
did in the Sistine Chapel, but surely
here, 'most of all in this gallery, was
needed a free-flowing organic growth
instead of this exercise in piecemeal
placement, the remoteness of which is
accentuated by the fact that, when you
look up, Big Brothers and Big Sisters
are so watching you from apertures
that you suspect that Piranesi would
have felt at home in such soulless,
totalitarian interiors. What a relief it
would have been if one could have
looked from this designer’s mausoleum
through lambent windows to the
almost frozen Central Court. <
There are problems, too, with the
hanging baffle boards which disperse
light and conceal functional fixtures; in
grey, they work splendidly for the
Mediterranean antiquities, but in brown
they disturb the shapes of primitive
shields and slabby carvings. The comers
provided problems; artificially lit, they
are used for watercolors, drawings, and
manuscripts, and if they seem spatially
crowded they always open to the glories
of vistas of paintings and artefacts.
One would never have thought that
The entrance to Victoria’s National
Gallery...outside, a temple; inside,
ecstasy
Leonard French’s ceiling...static,
niggardly, and passionless
the lighting of glassware, with fluor-
escent for form and spots for vitality,
could have provided such intimate
viewing. The walls are designed for the
creation of instant niches and alcoves,
and, for example, watercolor, which is
a thin art lacking in resonance and
organic force, certainly needs to be
alternated with niches for robust pot-
tery. The alcoves, which are delicately
lit, provide some startling juxtapositions
such as that of the intricate silver
epergne with a pale blue 18th-century
costume decorated with frail flowers.
The gallery is full of these sudden
extensions of aesthetic experiences;
cabinets containing Mediterranean
antiquities are excellently placed and
designed. Egyptian hieroglyphics sing in
an orange alcove, and a funerary boat
steers its predestined course in a black
niche; the new Sumerian Head of
Gudea of about 2080 B.C. is so pre-
sented that it surges with life. The Dutch
paintings look fabulously serene and self-
sufficient, and the amplitude of the
sweeping forms of the old masters (we
have not really seen them before) like
Van Dyck’s Countess of Southampton,
Hobbema’s Old Oak, and Zoffany’s
Elizabeth Farren, make many of the
moderns look thin and stagy.
It is going to be a shock to the
young painters who will flock into The
Field hung in the silver-walled tem-
porary exhibitions area. What is shown
of “traditional” art is a highly selective
sampling based on quality. Yet the
Australian section, with which most are
familiar, contains some surprises such
as the influence of the Heidelberg
School on Clara Southern or J. Ford
Paterson’s Bush Symphony of 1900 that
is as vaporous as an Olitski; Olsen takes
his place with expressionists like Arthur
Boyd, and Robert Hunter’s pale, pale
work is near an almost-as-fugitive
Balson.

Tibetan goddess, Aryavalokitesvara and
the Tibetan Tankha with 12ft. of
vignettes of the Life of Buddha to
Tapies’ gloomy plague, everything is
done to make art enhance life; in the
Decorative Arts, under Kenneth Hood,
who, like other Curators, has taken
advantage of the freedom Mr. Grounds’
plan gives, art and life are brought into
happy encounters.
One cannot tell yet how well the
gallery will function administratively
or what it will mean to scholars, but it
is a fine showplace for revealing the
best, and, even if this is highly selective,
there is so much that the restaurant
and snack bar are necessary for fortifi-
cation. Those who have faced New
York’s serried ranks of Greek vases or
Hamburg’s maze of tiny rooms with tiny
pictures may be thankful for some selec-
tivity. It is, of course, the greatest
gallery in Australia; flexible despite its
limitations, it presents works without
detracting from them something
done only in the world’s best museums.
MUSIC/KENNETH ROBINS
PREACHING, TEACHING
ONE OF THE main aims of the
Organ Institute of N.S.W. is “to work
for the reacceptance of organ music
as a normal part of the musical
activities of the community ...” a
valiant and worthy purpose indeed,
but extraordinarily difficult to imple-
ment. All the larger instruments are
usually preposterous great bags of
wind in the Town Halls of the major
cities or an assorted selection in
churches, both groups largely unplay-
able through neglect.
The ai'm of the Organ Institute
comes up against two hard facts.
Firstly, that churches have ceased to
be communal centres and, secondly,
that the very remoteness of the player
stuck up in the loft, often many yards
from the sound he initiates, is opposed
to the intensely intimate nature of the
popular artistic communication of our
day.
I respectfully suggest that the
breakthrough to the music-loving
public is more likely to be effected
by a series of, say, the Handel Con-
certos with a small orchestra and a
chainber organ ensconced within the
ensemble. Anybody who has heard
Marie-Claire Alain play these works
with the Jean-Francois Paillard
Chamber Orchestra can testify to their
urgency, freshness, and direct appeal.
Of course, this would entail something
of a financial risk and the Institute
may not be prepared to accept such
a responsibility; but properly pro-
moted I cannot see how such a pro-
ject could fail.
The recital in Christ Church St.
Laurence, Sydney, by Neil Cameron,
in association with Robert Ingram
(violin) and Vincent Sheppard, was,
while not denying its eloquence, an
example of preaching to the converted.
Tessa Birnie ...history of the keyboard
One wished that more of the people
the Institute is trying to reach were
present, for there was music-making
of a high order to be heard and the
spoken introductions were a model of
concise, relevant, and unpretentious
scholarship.
Mr. Ca'meron used the baroque
sections of the organ impressively in a
“Voluntary,” by Maurice Greene, and
a “Canzona,” by Buxtehude, eschew-
ing flashy combinations and allowing
the music to flow logically and ex-
pressively. Dupre’s “Cortege et
Litanie,” which followed, is probably
regarded as music for fuddy-duddies,
but it. has great charm and invention
and is the product of those components
which go to make up both talent, and
genius, as indeed was the next item,
“Reeks-Veranderingen,” by Cor Kee,
an amusing example of professional
iconoclasm all the more diverting be-
cause it was being performed on what
must still be regarded as an instru-
ment of the Establishment.
Reading through the program before
the third of the four recitals in the
historical series of keyboard music by
Tessa Birnie at the Sydney St. James
Playhouse, I found an entertainment
in itself. Miss Bimie’s pithy comments
are instructive and some are inclined
to be arbitrary. But they are hardly
likely to bring on thundering apoplexy
in even the most conventionally minded
music-lover and, I must say, I relished
them for their succinctness and lack of
compromise.
The Dussek Sonata, which opened
the program, contained in its intro-
duction as uncannily a Chopinesque
passage as the Impromptu Op.
142, No. 4, of Schubert; but the
promise of revelation was hardly
fulfilled, for there is much of the
Sonata which is run-of-the-mill stuff,
and Miss Birnie was not disposed to
elevate it, as she did later with the
Mendelssohn “Venetian Gondola
Song.”
As the cult of the individual was at
its height during the 19th century, and
14 composers were represented in this
recital, one feared Miss Birnie was
courting the fate of the chameleon
which was placed on a tartan rug. How-
ever, she performed her stylistic somer-
saults with extraordinary aplomb.
There can be few pianists in the


world who could take on such a remark-
able tour de force as this series, and
if the other recitals have been of the
calibre of the third Miss Birnie can
well lay claim to being unique among
her genre.
THEATRE/REX CRAMPHORNE
VOICES OF A TOWN
The Rimers of Eldritch. Lanford Wil-
son. Ensemble Theatre, Sydney.
DESPITE THE air of women’s maga-
zine fiction about the title, the
Ensemble’s new play, “The Rimers of
Eldritch,” is something of an experi-
ment in dramatic form. Admittedly, it
is a fairly traditional experiment the
sort in which dramatic statement is
shaded off into poetry. “Poetic drama”
had its heyday in the ’3os and ’4os, and
it is interesting to see what a play that
looks a little like a cross between
“Under Milkwood” and “Our Town”
finds of relevance to the ’6os in this
tradition.
The simple plotline about a miscar-
riage of justice is designed to describe
the society in which it is set (a Middle
West ghost town) rather than to tell a
story. Consequently, the author is free
to abandon normal time sequence,
putting the play together in snatches of
dialogue which tend toward abstract
verbal pattern, and away from conven-
tional representation. The dialogue also
establishes a large gallery of characters
whose identity, as a group, is equivalent
to that of the town—we construct “Eld-
ritch” mentally from its citizens and
their fragmentary plot relationships.
The actors represent the town on a quite
literal level when they become the
woods in which the central action takes
place.
The problem is that this sort of
descriptive realisation of the physically
and morally decaying old town is not
essentially dra'matic. In an effort to
sustain some sort of forward move-
ment in the play, the central incident
of the story is kept till last; we see
bits of the trial, the reasons for the
crime, and the verdict long before
we know what the crime was. This
produces a strange imbalance the
basically static statement of the play
being at odds with the “I don’t under-
stand. What happened? Oh, I see”
treatment of the central incident. That
this should seem such a problem is
probably more the fault of the produc-
tion than of the play. The performance
of the dialogue has to be sufficiently
interesting in itself to prevent us fro'm
bothering about the realistic frame-
work of events underlying it.
It is in its use of the group of
actors then that the play is most in
touch with contemporary developments
in theatre, since it provides opportuni-
ties for exciting ensemble work. A
script note tells us that in performance
at Cafe La Mama the play was acted
on a series of levels “against a black
void.” In such a setting the actors
must evoke the physical and mental
reality of the town with no other
means than voices, bodies, and
lighting.
The Ensemble’s production (John
Macleod) does not attempt to bring
off quite such a difficult feat. A “set”
(Ross Major) uses the theatre’s space
effectively, providing specific, identi-
fiable areas for various parts of the
play’s action. Signposts and maps in
the foyer suggest an attempt to
establish a sort of theatrical reality
for “Eldritch” (in rather the way
a proscenium stage set would), on
which the actors can rely. Within
this framework the actors’ efforts
are concentrated on polishing up
their individual characterisations and
in fussy literal treatment of the
fragments of plotline, so that tiny
scenes are played at unreal levels of
intensity as if the actors feel a need
to screw up interest in the story and
their own involvement in the
characters. The result is that the
audience is bogged down in the sur-
face detail and never shown the
pattern.
In the places where the script is
most abstract the scenes in the
woods and, especially, in the one
entirely composed of disconnected
phrases and sentences the produc-
tion works best. This suggests that
elsewhere in the play characterisa-
tion, once mastered, needs to be
subordinated to ensemble playing and
the formal pattern of the writing.
THEATRE/ROBERT WARD
SLAB OF REALISM
Death of a Salesman. Arthur Miller.
Union Hall, Adelaide.
MILLER’S tragedy of a small man
was first produced in 1948, and many
words have flowed under the pros-
cenium arch since then. But if there
are to be modern classics, then “Death
of a Salesman” must be one, and Jean
Marshall’s Union Hall production
displays the play’s enduring qualities.
Willy Loman is pathetic as he dis-
covers his own insignificance. His sons,
callous products of a callous society,
twist the knife harder, forcing Willy’s
open acknowledgment of self-
deception. The mother, clear-sighted
and candid, knows the reality, but is
too anguished to complain. Willy
Loman is in one sense one of the
century’s archetypes, the man of limited
dreams who is crushed by an imper-
sonal society.
Miss Marshall’s direction is very
straightforward. Stan Ostoja’s set is
detailed and solid, with three cut-away
rooms, a yard, and background of sky-
scraper shapes. It is a competent, if
unimaginative, design. In conception
the production is a slab of conven-
tional American realism, in which
even the most fluid dream sequences
have a hard, definite edge, and the
set accentuates this, which is a pity.
Frank Hind’s Uncle Ben is perhaps
the most unfortunate element, for, with
stetson, Victorian frock-coat, and
cravat, he is more a middle-aged Bat
Masterson than a ’twenties business
tycoon. The 'mistake is incomprehen-
sible. Russell Starke as Biff and Dean
Roberts as Happy, the two sons, are
not happily cast in their very demand-
ing roles. As lush-headed adults, they
lack strength, and as juvenile enthusi-
asts in the dream sequences they
grossly overact their sibling mateship.
The night really goes to Morna
Jones’ mother (Linda), who is bal-
anced, intense, and quite on the point
of actual brokenheartedness. “Atten-
tion must be paid” to Willy, she
insists, with a tension that melts the
audience and defines Willy’s tragedy.
Brian Wenzel’s Willy has real strengths,
but it is through Miss Jones’ perform-
ance that we see them, reflected in and
magnified by her expression of
anguish and total concern.
“The Rimers of Eldritch”...a dramatic experiment


The nostalgia industry
WHEN the commercial theatre can’t
sustain itself with enough profitable
new plays it reaches back to its nos-
talgic past for reliable treasures that
have the advantage of appealing to the
wistfulness of one generation and the
sense of trendy discovery of another.
Nostalgia, with all its by-products, is
now an intensively cultivated industry,
and in London owes a lot to the
theatre for momentum, style, and
substantiating mood. True, there is a
safe conservatism about such sort of
theatre, but the richness it attracts to
the box-office is liberal.
Revival productions of three plays
which have just opened in Sydney
show the theatre’s contribution to the
nostalgia industry in attractive sum-
mary. Sandy Wilson’s “The Boy
Friend,” directed by the author at the
Phillip Theatre, is a pastiche of 1920 s
musical co’medy and stimulated an
exhaustive re-examination of the years
between the two wars after it was first
produced in London in 1953. Since
then it has rarely been out of produc-
tion on one stage or another around
the world and currently is having a
successful revival season in London’s
West End. At Sydney s Palace Theatre,
two of Noel Cowards most enduring
comedies “Present Laughter” and
“Private Lives”—are alternating week
about in a “Coward festival season,”
directed by Englishman Anthony
Sharp, who has updated the 1943
period of the first play but cleverly
kept the second in the style of its 1930
origins. The three plays are being
presented under a joint production
arrangement which has brought Phillip
Productions and the Sydney impre-
sario Harry M. Miller together for the
first time. The total investment in the
three productions amounts to about
$75,000, with the wage bill for the
casts (photographed above), “The Boy
Friend” orchestra and directors’ fees
totalling about $7OOO a week. The
investment seems comfortably safe.
All three plays are scheduled for
extensive Australian tours, with “The
Boy Friend” alone not due to transfer
from Sydney to Melbourne until next
June. The Coward season has a lease
on the Palace until November 30, and
is likely to be the last legit show seen
in that theatre. DENIS O’BRIEN.

BALLET/CAROLYN SYMES
POWERFUL MESSAGES
NOW, MORE than ever, I am con-
vinced of the worth of ballet as a
versatile medium of communication. Its
graphic use in the second program of
the Australian Ballet’s 1968 season is a
revelation. Throughout, movement and
mime transmit feelings and thoughts
in “Jeunesse,” too sensitive even to
prattle about, in “Threshold,” so bold
they astound, and in “Elektra,” so
lustful they nauseate.
Whether by design or accident (I
suspect the latter, because the time
devoted to the creation of the first two
works was scanty), this program of
two world premiere ballets and another
marking up its second season (“Elektra”
was given its Australian debut in 1966)
is well composed. The comparatively
innocent theme of “Jeunesse” by the
ballet’s principal male dancer-cum-
choreographer, Garth Welch, is a de-
lightful visual aperitif to the rest of
the program. The message in “Thres-
hold” is conveyed with such maturity
by the choreography of American John
Butler that its sensuality is relatively
inoffensive. Rather, it acts as a portent
for the avaricious violence which
reaches a climax in “Elektra,” Robert
Helpmann’s conception, in dance, of the
Greek tragedy “The Orestia.”
This programming groups together
three of the Ballet’s modern repertoire,
which, by their very nature, may well
offend even trend-following, free-
thinking, and receptive minds, not to
mention those bent toward conserva-
tism. Therefore, it affords an oppor-
tunity for those members of the
Australian ballet public who don’t have
sturdy aesthetic constitutions to stay
away without missing an offering more
suitable to their tastes.
I suggest, though, that the insertion
of more lucid program notes would add
to adult audiences’ understanding of
these modern ballets. They would also
help parents answer the innumerable
and often, perhaps, embarrassing ques-
tions that no doubt will be posed by
their matinee-subscribing children.
Happily, each ballet is well endowed
with classical movements. All three
interpret human reactions to cardinal
elements of life, but each choreog-
rapher’s interpretation is different.
The theme of “Jeunesse” is the least
complex; more ordinary than “the
landscape of passion, unreasoned
terror and violence” of the world
depicted in “Threshold,” and the
furiousness of “Elektra.”
The playful dances of Youth
(“Jeunesse”) to Prokofiev’s Piano
Concerto No. 3 appropriately per-
mitted so’me lesser-known members of
the company to exhibit their skills as
solo artists, but often the choreog-
raphy failed to give sufficient sup-
port. I had the feeling that this ballet
was under-rehearsed, and it didn’t really
add strength to the rumor that Garth
Welch promises Australia a talented,
young choreographer. Although Donald
Scene from John Butler’s new ballet
“Threshold ”
Laycock’s vaguely psychedelic sets
were bare but colorful, the costumes
(attributed to Ray Powell) in par-
ticular the boys’, which looked like
left-overs from Robin Hood’s Merry
Men were in conflict.

and body-revealing costumes aptly rep-
resented the depressing and debauched
world of “Threshold.” The strong and
beautifully flowing movements, danced
with complete absorption by princi-
pals Kathleen Geldard, Garth Welch,
Alan Alder, Josephine Jason, and a
fine corps de ballet, were mellow but
extraordinarily meaningful. The action
was at one with the music, which was
the taped version from which Butler
worked out his composition. (When
the score arrived late from behind the
Iron Curtain it was impossible to
decipher.)
“Elektra” was unmistakably the pro-
duct of Robert Helpmann’s theatrical
talent. It is a ballet of non-stop action,
and every movement and attitude was
'executed with dramatic precision by
Carolyn Rappel and Warren de Maria
as Clytemnestra and Aegisthus. Kath-
leen Geldard achieved tremendous
effect with every step in her role as
Elektra, and Gerard Sibbritt (Orestes)
gave strong support in this dance drama
to Malcolm Arnold’s virile music.
Arthur Boyd’s unabashed decor more
than adequately suited the sexy insinua-
tions in the choreography.
I must confess I approached this
second program of unconventional
moderns with trepidation; and some
murmurs of disapproval that reached
my ears, particularly during the second
half of the program, confirmed my
feelings. But I do feel that ballet must
be represented in the mood of the
times, and, if nothing else, these ballets
will sort the sheep from the goats.


FILMS/BEVERLEY TIVEY
WHERE APES RULE
Planet Of The Apes. Director, Frank-
lin J. Schaffner.
The Odd Couple. Director, Gene Saks.
I SUPPOSE most people are slightly
alarmed by stories of movies about the
future: after all, the way things are
going, we can’t be sure that we’re
going to have one. The danger is that
this attitude may lead to a too serious
and literal approach to “Planet Of
The Apes.” It’s no use expecting a
second “2001.” This one’s purely for
fun.
I have not read Pierre Boulle’s
novel, which ’may have been terribly
solemn and allegorical, but nobody can
persuade me that director Schaffner
and his scriptwriters (Rod Serling and
Michael Wilson) were out to make
anything more than an entertainment,
in which they’ve succeeded most dis-
armingly. Even the final image seemed
to me a deliberate attempt to shock in
a completely un-serious way rather
than sound a dreadful warning.
Charlton Heston is head of a team
of astronauts sent on a space voyage
of several light years, apparently
undertaken in the hope that they’ll
eventually land somewhere. They do
—on a planet of desert and jungle,
where man is the (literally) dumb
beast and civilised monkeys rule.
Though this inversion of roles could
afford plenty of opportunities for
satirical and philosophical comment,
the scriptwriters, as a rule, deliberately
ignore them, relying instead on simpler
forms of humor. “Human see, human
do,” comments an ape, shrugging off
a suggestion that man might have
intelligence; and a monkey making a
funeral oration intones: “He used to
say, ‘I never met an ape I didn’t like.’ ”
The performances are deft and in
keeping with the movie’s frivolous
attitude, with the honors going to Kim
Hunter, funny and oddly endearing as
an ape-scientist who manages, too, to
give the impression of a very pretty
little monkey. The ape make-up is
remarkably effective all through; and
though the color reproduction is a
little chancy I think we must blame
the quality of the print seen here
rather than the cameraman.
Now, a belated but sincere tribute
to Neil Simon’s “The Odd Couple,”
brought to the screen by Gene Saks
with the minimum of fuss to make
one of the most genuinely funny
comedies this year. This crisp,
eminently likable play tells the story
of two divorced men of different
character whose attempt to share an
apartment becomes a wild parody
of their unsuccessful marriages;
and if it has any message it is that
divorce comes about less from sexual
incompatibility or infidelity than from
unmatched temperaments and the
abrasions of ordinary daily living
together.
Communicating
ULCER GULCH
WHAT you might call the inner
workings of the ABC are to be exam-
ined by an outside body. The Gastro-
Enterology Department of the Royal
Prince Alfred Hospital, Sydney, is
doing a survey on causes of gastric
ulcers, and the ABC management has
agreed to letting the department have
a look at the ABC crop. The implied
suggestion that life in the ABC is
notably ulcer-producing is fascinating.
It also seems to overlook another fer-
tile source—newspapers.
EXCELLENCE PERISHES
IN THE midst of plenty, the N.S.W.
Art Gallery “Quarterly,” that began in
1959, has perished through lack of
funds and staff. The July issue is its
last. The “Quarterly,” which was not
surpassed by its excellent rivals from
the State galleries in Perth, Melbourne,
Adelaide, and Auckland, was a neces-
sary corrective to commercial pres-
sures, and though it sometimes
enshrined the insignificant its view was
a balanced one.
The final issue is merely a pictorial
guide to the nature of recent purchases
and indicates how overworked the
Gallery staff must be. In fact, the situ-
ation in almost every aspect of the
Gallery is such that it would be a
public scandal if public figures were
capable of cultural shame.
And it is all rather humiliating.
While the Victorian Cultural Centre
can persuade Philip Morris to publish
a sumptuous catalogue for a temporary
show, can have Cheshires publish a
$21 work on its collection, can, by
arrangement with the Oxford Press,
print valuable monographs, and can
itself publish Dr. Ursula Hoff’s pains-
taking record of European paintings
before 1800, the N.S.W. Gallery, apart
from its booklets on yearly acquisitions
and splendid catalogues on Dobell
and Nolan, has been unable to under-
take anything remarkable since “A
Catalogue of Australian Oil Paintings”
in 1953.
THE AGONY OF COMEDY
TONY HANCOCK gave the world
the most recent tragic example of how
crushingly serious the business of
being funny can be. Now, Australian
John Ford has given perspective to
the agony in a novel which seems to
have been modelled on Hancock’s
life. It was not. Ford began writing
his book, “The Blue Comedian,” at
least two years ago while working in
London as European director of public
relations for Qantas. When he sub-
mitted it to Angus and Robertson
the resemblance of Timmy Brown
(Ford’s comedian) to Tony Hancock
.was enough for the publishers to hand
it to their lawyers for scrutiny. It
was with them when Hancock died,
but even before that they had approved
its publication.
The book is about a melancholy
English comedian who is on the skids
in London and who decides to take
a last-chance opportunity for a come-
back by touring Australia, where his
BBC shows are still affectionately
known. It all sounds eerily familiar
and Mr. Ford is aware that many will
refuse to believe that his plot was
prescient.
Most of the book is set in Australia,
and however much of the fiction
comes from the author’s imagination,
Sydney readers won’t have any trouble
recognising one outstanding fact.
Timmy Brown’s first comeback per-
formance in Australia takes place at
the Sydney Stadium, and when he first
stands inside that “vast, concrete and
galvanised iron, maker of massive
traffic jams after six,” his horrified
reaction is very little different to Bob
Hope’s.
John Ford flew to England for the
London launching of the book last
week and returned at the weekend
to prepare for publication here in'
October.
BELLS IN THE BOX-OFFICE
IF YOU haven’t heard the commer-
cial theatre moaning recently it
might be because box-office business
is generally joyous. On the J. C.
Williamson circuit (which virtually
comprises the commercial theatre in
Australia), “Marne” is playing to big
houses in Melbourne, “Fiddler On
the Roof” is breaking all but “My
Fair Lady” records round Australia,
and “Man of La Mancha” did sur-
prisingly well for a musical so com-
paratively difficult to exploit. Barry
Humphries became much richer dur-
ing his recent season in Melbourne
and is heavily booked at Sydney’s
cavernous Tivoli. (He’s now even
reported to be considering returning
to Australia to live, taking a working
holiday in London three months a
year; which sounds like significant
gratitude.)
The only stage flop of the moment
is the Peter Shaffer double-bill now
playing under its absurd new title
“Lark in the Dark” at the Theatre
Royal, Sydney. Its lights are almost
out. Not even Madge Ryan, with
her Australian name and London
reputation, can pull in the business,
but Stuart Wagstaff and Sue Becker,
with their local TV exposure, are
drawing good crowds to the Noel
Coward season at the Palace. Wag-
staff, particularly, is pleased: he has
money in the production.

Books
ONE VIEW OF "THE
LIVELIEST AND
BRIGHTEST HERE"
By NANCY KEESING
Australian Writing Today. Edited by
Charles Higham. Penguin. $1.30.
AT FIRST reading this anthology is
enjoyable though conservative—how-
ever, it immediately suggests a number
of questions about editorial responsi-
bility. The first question is how far
an editor is justified in disarming
criticism by stating: “It (this book) is
not intended to be fully ‘representa-
tive’ or all-inclusive, but rather to reflect
one man’s view of what is liveliest and
brightest here.”
Complete subjectivity is allowable in
personal anthologies like Higham’s own
“Australians Abroad” and unallowable
in a definitive selection. Just where this
collection should be graded between
these extremes readers must decide,
keeping in mind the stated aims of the
“Writing Today” series. However, in
some areas editorial responsibility is
clearer.
In my view, and I claim experience,
an editor has a duty, professional and
ethical, to fight for his authors like a
tigress for her cubs. He can, often and
rightly, escape censure for subjectivity
but never for mistakes, major or minor,
in the selections printed or, when a book
carries notes or biographies, etc., for
avoidable errors in these. On such
scores this book must stand indicted.
As far as I know, the worst treated
of its authors is Alexander Craig, who
is wronged by two glaring misprints in
his poem “Hillside” and the omission
of 30 lines: — thirty! —from “Philosopher
Among New Ruins,” a catastrophe
which rubbishes his poem. Editions
have been withdrawn for less, and per-
haps this one should have been. A. D.
Hope’s “Crossing the Frontier” has a
ridiculous, damaging error in its penul-
timate verse.
I am told that blame for the proof-
reading rests with the publishers in
London. This is an unacceptable
excuse editors should check proofs,
though it costs a fortune in airmail
their responsibility is absolute. Lest some
readers think it might be difficult to
spot mistakes in modem verse (and, in-
deed, it sometimes is difficult when
verse is experimental, technically or
typographically), it must be said that
the Hope and Craig poems are unequi-
vocally straightforward, logical, and
consecutive. Some of the prose here
fares badly, too, and not because it is
antipodean and exotic, i.e., when
“G.H.D.” Cole has his initials
scrambled.
“Australian Writing Today” carries
brief biographies these, too, are
questionable as to fact, grammar
(unlucky Alexander Craig again!), and
because they are inconsistent. For ex-
ample, R. D. Fitz Gerald is here credited
with his 0.8. E. nobody else is. There
are piffling personal details in some
cases everything relevant is omitted
in others no mention, for instance,
that Douglas Stewart is as distinguished
for plays as for poetry that for some
of the writers here, travel or experience
in professions other than writing is cen-
tral to their work. There are mis-
leading remarks who has described
Robert Fitz Gerald as “an Australian
Robert Frost”? (That is, who apart
from Higham himself in his introduc-
tion?) Some biographies are two lines
long, others eight or nine. Some authors
list many publications (significantly,
they are mostly the less important
writers A. D. Hope has none listed!),
and so it goes.
To return to “one man’s view of
what is liveliest and brightest here.”
By “here,” do not understand “here
and . now,” for there is a large tally of
expatriates of which some reviewers
have already disapproved—l don’t, but
would question the complete absence
of migrant writers like David Martin
and Judah Waten.
The book is arranged with taste and
skill. It is readable and contains no
poem, and only one story, unworthy of
inclusion. Documentary writing is
both historically and currently one of
the chief, though least acknowledged,
strengths of Australian prose. It is
well exemplified by Moorehead’s
“Borrowed Light” (Antarctica), but
the emergence of New Guinea as a
preoccupation of our literature
recently is not noticed, nor is the pub-
lication of historians like Blainey and
Manning Clark, who are indubitable
“creative” writers in their special
fields.
Novelists are ill served, too tw r o
excerpts from full-length books (by
Clive Barry and Hal Porter) are in-
cluded with effect. There is no
Keneally, Morphett, Astley, Tennant,
Durack. No poet younger than Ran-
dolph Stow, no contributor, indeed,
born later than 1939.
The poets are, then, “tried and
true,” though none the worse for that,
and, considering space available, fairly
represented. Fitz Gerald and Hope have
room to display some of their depth
and range; Stewart’s “The Garden of
Ships” does not show, by itself, the
extent of his versatility or his recent
preoccupations. David Campbell
appears as a story-writer only a
peculiar decision.
The Judith Wright poems are not
ones which give a true picture of her
breadth, passion, and power Rose-
mary Dobson is better served, although
her ironic wit is not exemplified. The
Randolph Stow bracket, on the other
hand, does fairly parade his brilliance,
the Harwood and Hart Smith selec-
tions are well chosen, and so are
Higham’s own. However, it "must be
said again that in the poetry, and to a
lesser extent in the stories, reading is
impeded because whenever one comes
upon a word used in an unusual or
unexpected way one is pulled up, to
wonder whether this is as intended or
is, perchance, a misprint.
The “Writing Today” series plans to
present prose and poetry “which is
being read and discussed in the country
or area concerned, and which is in the
forefront of the whole cultural move-
ment.” By these criteria, Higham
must be judged: if you decide that
you more often discuss Kenneally and
Manning Clark, Robin Boyd and
Craig MacGregor than Ray Mathew
and Alwyn Lee if you prefer, say,
Ross Campbell as you read him “here
and now” rather than “then and
there” then you may agree with
my summing-up: not really successful.
VIETNAM CASUALTY
By FRANK ROBERTS
Count Your Dead. John Rowe. Angus
and Robertson. $3.50.
JOHN ROWE’S novel of the Vietnam
War has already become something of
a talking point, mentioned in Parlia-
ment and on television, reviewed in
newspapers, and praised (according to-
the jacket blurb) by Denis Warner. It
is unusual because written by an Aus-
tralian about Americans in Vietnam,
Rowe...hardly upsetting the
Pentagon
perhaps with the U.S. market in mind.
Fears have been expressed that it
might somehow upset the Pentagon,
harm the alliance, etc., but the idea
seems rather ridiculous in view of all
that has been said and written in the
United States against America’s pres-


ence in Vietnam; in that prespective, at
worst, it could only be viewed in an
et tu Brute light.
It is the story of an American
brigade’s movement into a province
which it will “secure and hold” and
then “pacify”; the story of the foul-
ups which occur, with some back-
ground on how they occur, as the
Americans well-meaning but ruth-
less when the chips are down fail
to carry out any of their objectives.
Bill Morgan, who enters the story as
a company com'mander in the initial
helicopter landing, in which he wins a
Silver Star and his majority, is the
central figure; the man who is placed
in charge of the pacification program,
begins to let his heart rule his head,
and becomes the grit in the military
machine or, come right down to it,
the mote in his Colonel’s eye.
The author places Morgan in the
role of the liberal American conscience
which has to fight • its way through a
jungle where deeply held convictions
on right and wrong become inter-
twined with the realities of a war unlike
any other the Americans have fought
in. Morgan listens to a French planter,
to the Vietnamese province chief, to
fellow officers who mouth opinions
varying from the way to handle the
Colonel and survive to sentiments that
make John Birch seem Left Wing
and gets more deeply confused. And
much of his confusion centres on the
Colonel, with whose “loneliness of
command” he sympathises while win-
cing at the inevitable results of that
career officer’s mistakes, and even
tnore so at the facility with which the
.Colonel covers them.
As Rowe dramatises Morgan’s
mental turmoil, he sketches in most of
the world’s arguments for and against
the war in Vietnam, but without
adding any new thoughts or dimen-
sions to it, without even allowing his
alter ego the benefit of a formed and
definite opinion. For these reasons I
do not see it as a particularly worth-
while novel (though Rowe deserves
praise, on another level, for a well-
organised first novel) but think that
it might have been if Rowe had
written about the Australians in
Vietnam. In writing about the Ameri-
cans, he has included one scene of
Australian officers as guests in an
American Services bar where an Ugly
Australian holds the floor, and another
gets ear-bashed (that’s a switch) by
an American.
Rowe’s insights into the American
military mind are no more modern, or
revealing, than American novelists
have provided during the past 20
y.ears. They have also gone more .
deeply into the strains arising from the
conflict of eastern-based liberalism
and frontier-orientated conservatism in
the U.S.A. And for the extension of
these into Vietnam, new American war
novels are coming off the presses,
though slowly; one of the first was
“The Room,” a novel of conflict in an
interrogation room in Vietnam, with
the central character an officer in
disgrace, somewhat like Morgan.
Oddly, the author, Victor Kolpacoff,
had not “been there” as Rowe has, but
found this no bar to writing about the
war within confined limits.
A novel about Australians in Viet-
nam, similarly reflecting Australian
concerns and inner conflicts, allowing
us to see ourselves, or an important
part of ourselves, through Australians’
behaviour in modern warfare, has yet to
be written and published. It could be
very profitable, both to the author and
his readers.
Finally, two things struck me as
quaint about Rowe’s novel. American
Negro soldiers were mentioned only
twice, and very casually. They had no
voice in Bill Morgan’s mind, although
their presence in Vietnam is one of
the concerns of the kind of American
Morgan was supposed to embody.
And the sum total of this war novel’s
sexual episodes was one timid
approach to a bar girl, who arranged
to meet Morgan at his hotel but
never showed.
AIMING BREEZY KICKS
By MARIA WOLKOWSKY
The Heartsnatcher. Boris Vian. Rapp
and Whiting. $3.25.
NO, NOT THE biography of Dr.
Christiaan Barnard, though at first
glance both the title and the strikingly
bloody dustjacket, adorned with human
spare-parts, seem to suggest it. Any
other similarities are purely super-
ficial: the central character is indeed
a medico; and in his native France
the author, Boris Vian, is fast reaching
a comparably glamorous pin-up status
among young intellectuals. At the
moment he is well on the way to ele-
vation as another cult-hero. His newly
discovered voice is hailed rather as the
first cuckoo call that, Rousseau-like,
heralded the present spring of revolt-
ing youth. Like Che Guevara, his pre-
mature death has enshrined and
embalmed him. He will remain for-
ever 39 (only one more year and he
might have been disqualified). He fell
as a martyr in the cause of liberty,
even if only when fighting against the
censor’s scissors, and even if merely
in defence of his own work.
Certainly, Vian’s pen seems to have
been uncannily prophetic. His writings
foretell the new young Adam clamor-
ing for read'mittance to the Garden of
Eden, even if he has to bash down the
walls to get there. The fact that Vian
also blew his own trumpet in his own
jazz band, that he was tried for obscen-
ity, and was Transcendent Satrap of the
College de Pataphysique hasn’t exactly
hurt his ratings, either.
“Heartsnatcher” aims deceptively
breezy kicks at three of the biggest
chips on contemporary shoulders:
parental smother-love, the hell-and-
brimstone message of an out-of-touch
church, and the whole absurd tragi-
comedy of life itself naturally all
the fault of that middle-aged misman-
age'ment upstairs. However, it is glori-
ously impartial and completely non-
political. The charge-account of
wrongs is presented boldly in black
and white but never in pink or red.
Dr. Timortis is a very junior psych-
iatrist in search of experience. Some-
where in France he wanders into a
mythical village where, like an essence
of poison, the world’s ills are concen-
trated in miniature. Here he makes an
emergency delivery of unwanted
triplets from a reluctant mother who
speedily does a complete about turn.
She has no sooner clapped her eyes
on Noel, Joel, and Alfa Romeo than
she breaks out into a severe rash of
s'mother-love which quickly becomes a
chronic neurosis.
While the children happily devour
grubs in the garden and take fantastic
flights from the attic, she broods on
the big bad world outside just waiting
to gobble her darlings up on all the
bolts of lightning, on all the cliff edges,
on all the dangerous traffic, on all the
many-pronged viruses, on all the un-
covered wells, on all the germs on the
brand-new packs of toilet-rolls into
which, under which, and from which
they might possibly fall. Her neurotic
flights of fancy become more fantastic
than her children’s. In maternity she
has found her vocation.
First she drives their father, Angel,
away. Then she drives the nurse,
Katherine Whitearse, away. Then she
locks the gates. Then she cuts down
all the trees. Then she removes the
garden wall. Then she removes the
garden. Then she removes the children
into the house. Then she builds a dome
over the top of the house. Finally,
inside the dome, inside the house,
inside the living-room, she encases her
three normal small sons in three
golden, beautifully furnished, and
padded cages, where nothing abso-
lutely nothing can ever happen to-
them again . . .
But in this curious French village
anything can happen. Take the case
of the local whipping-boy, Glory Halle-
lujah; for gold, he accepts everyone’s
sins, everyone’s guilt. His occupation is
fishing everyone’s dirt out of the river
of scarlet blood that flows right
through the little town. Glory seems
only vaguely connected with the
church, which seems only vaguely
connected with God, who seems only
vaguely connected with the people. In
this out-of-the-way backwater, God,
as the vicar assures them, is a luxury.
Why should he pray for rain? “This
is a church, not a shower,” he thun-
ders from the pulpit. “God is not a
utilitarian. He is a birthday present.
A free gift. A luncheon voucher. An
ingot of platinum. A priceless picture.
A French pastry. God is so'mething
extra. And he is neither for nor against
...” Instead, the vicar rigs a boxing-
match with the devil (his curate),
fails to hit below the belt, but wins
on a “technical knockout” with the
mike. (And, incidentally, it does rain.)
The villagers don’t bother much

except for diversion. They have their
own God. And they have their own
very strong sense of sin. As long as it
is someone else’s. They piously crucify
their stallions for being stallions. They
regularly beat and starve all their
underdogs and underlings. Dr. Timor-
tis detests this terrible tribe yet cannot
shake it fro'm his hair. He stays. He
psychoanalyses. G. Hallelujah dies.
Dr. Timortis takes over his job on the
scarlet stream. The allegorical text for
today: the old-time religion is dead,
long live psychiatry the new.
Boris Vian’s first novel to be re-
leased in English, “Froth on the Day-
dream,” a tender surrealistic tragedy
of young love, reviewed in these pages
at the end of last year, is generally
considered to be his masterpiece. But,
in my opinion at least, “Heart-
snatcher” is more significant, if only
because it casts a bigger shadow.
Unlike many of the French contem-
poraries’, this novel is easy to read.
The mad, mod, neo-Dadaist language
swoops across the pages like a verbal
whirlwind, carrying the reader away
with it, willy-nilly. Because Nathalie
Sarraute and Robbe-Grillet sometimes
appear hard to bite into, there is a
general regrettable tendency to lump
the whole lot of their kind together
as indigestible for Anglo-Saxon diets.
Even that eminent London literary
critic A. Alvarez told me he has given
up trying to contest that idea.
Stanley Chapman has come forth
with another of his bright virtuoso
translations. The style is, as required,
wild, woolly, or wonderful. He doesn’t
miss out even on word play, spooner-
isms or double-talk, on “1st Julember
or 8th Octoptember” on “guessti-
mates or Algebraingels,” and he has
made Raymond Queneau’s striking
ballad-foreword of homage sound like
a lay to the first minstrel, which, con-
sidering this novel was written 15
years ago, Boris Vian most probably
was.
TASTE OF YELLOW
Today, a middle-aged man
jaunty, whistling
broke into a run as he drew close,
an uneven lope
like a kid enjoying himself, intent
on that moment.
With a grin, he flourished his hat,
bowed and moved
briskly on for fifty yards, and
loudly singing now
turned, retracing his steps
flapping his hands.
Human, I must judge this man
condemn his happiness
to appease the yoke of my intellect
because his joy
dares exceed the sphere of the
known.
My friend and I
staring with the eyes of the world
patronised
the broad, jogging back with a smirk.
Cuckoo, he said,
and I, tied to a million Joneses
agreed.

ONLY THE GREATEST
ARE BETTER
THAN OUR WHITES
SOME MONTHS ago I wrote of the
various white-wine styles and mentioned
the continued and expected improve-
ment in our rhine rieslings. Modestly
I am able to confirm my prognostica-
tions, for some of the whites made
this year from this variety are absolute
rippers.
I have also continued to look at a
number of overseas wines, and now I’m
even more convinced that we are mak-
ing whites to equal all but the greatest
of the traditional marques. And, the
red situation being what it is, we may
well get more fun and satisfaction from
these white styles today.
The name rhine riesling is ours, of
course. Another example of sturdy
colonial independence that does make
things so difficult now. One day we
shall get a good ampelographist to sort
things out, and the Wine Board will
insist we stick to the right names.
Dr. A. C. Kelly, another of our noted
wine doctors, the man who sold Tintara
in McLaren Vale to the Hardy’s in
1876, credits Macarthur himself with
the introduction of the variety in 1838,
the rootlings coming from the Rhein-
gau. Good breeding, for Rheingau
whites, the Englishman’s hocks, are still
said to be among the finest white wines
of the world today.
Many people have the impression
that all German wines are of the riesling
variety. Not so, although their two top
regions, the Mosel and the Rheingau,
are heavily planted with it. Of the
vines along the Mosel, 96 percent are
riesling, and in Rheingau 72 percent.
Yet in Germany overall the riesling
ranks behind the Sylvaner in produc-
tion, comprising only 26 percent of
the total. Most of the poor German
wines we get in Australia, imported at
a price for people who are persuaded
by fancy labels, come from other lesser
varieties with some misfit riesling
material chucked in.
The best wines come from Riesling,
and even in Germany, as Andre Simon
says, “ ... it must not be forgotten
that rieslings must be given the soil, the
aspect, and the other conditions which
happen to suit them best. They cannot
be grown anywhere and everywhere.”
The same applies here, and it appears
that most of our best wines are coming
either from grapes grown on hillslopes
at altitudes from 1000 to 1800 ft. above
sea level, or from colder areas. These
better-quality grapes, together with
more skills and better equipment,
have resulted in the better-quality
rieslings of the last few years.
And, as I said, they seem to be get-
ting better all the time. I have seen
several of the ’6B vintage and am most
impressed. Wynn’s have made one of
their best whites ever from Coonawarra
material, though it does have a bruised-
fruit character. The grapes were picked
in one day, crushed at once, and the
resultant juice taken by tanker to Mel-
bourne, where it was made into wine at
a controlled temperature. It has just
been bottled, so may recover from this
slightly off character. The fragrant nose
and flavor are quite delightful. The
best white at Wybong this year is a
rhine riesling, though I don’t know
when Penfold’s will be selling it. Peter
Lehmann, of Saltram’s, old Mud-flap
himself, has made two very good wines,
and the Henschke Riesling, still unclean
when I tasted it, shows tremendous
promise. Bob Hardy, of Thomas Hardy
and Sons, is quietly delirious about
their Seigersdorf Rhine Riesling, an
intensely aromatic wine with fine flavor
and crisp acid, the best white from
them for some time, and Mark Hill-
Smith, of Yalumba, is raving on about
their best from the high Pewsey Vale
plantings, situated 1800 ft. up where
Gilbert planted rhine riesling in the
1850 s. This is another delightful wine,
very delicate, yet with all the flavor and
nose in the world.
McWilliam’s provide an exception to
the altitude thought. Their ’6B rhine
riesling is from Hanwood, in the
Riverina district, and it is a most
worthy descendant of the famous ’66
wine. It has already won a Gold in
Brisbane, an award I strongly support,
since I was delighted with the glass I
had at a masked tasting. The ’6B is
more delicate than the ’66 and lacks
the intense middle palate of that wine,
which I think is a pity. But it has
colossal vinosity, sheer power of varietal
character. I understand Mac’s may be
releasing the ’66 next year. This con-
tains the touch of sauvignon blanc I’ve
talked about, which does help fill up
the palate.
For I think this is the deficiency of
our top whites still. Tim Knappstein
has made what he thinks is his best
white yet, a ’6B *Leasingham Riesling,
which has everything except this full-
ness and intensity on the palate. It’s a
bit thin. When our winemakers over-
come this, we will dazzle the world.
And though they acquire some depth
with bottle age, I’m not sure that this
is the answer. They are best enjoyed
young, or at least fairly young. One of
Meredith’s characters disagrees, “Hocks,
too, have encompassed age. I have
tasted senior hocks. Their flavor is a
brook of many voices; they have depth
also.” And Andre Simon drank a 1540
Steinwein, yes, 1540, in 1961 that was
still in condition. But I think that’s
taking bottle age a little far.
For one of the fascinating things
about wine in Australia is that it’s all
happening, as they say on the fish-eyed
screen. I hope you enjoy some of the
’6B rhine rieslings I’ve mentioned —and
I’m sure there are many others, from
Buring’s and Gramp’s and Seaview and
Qyelltaler. And don’t harbor them, for
I’m convinced that we shall see better
and better wines each year.
If only they could get more guts in
the middle.
CONNOISSEUR
TABLE WINES
NOTES FROM LINDEMAN'S
CELLAR MANAGER
It is always pleasing to the maker when
a wine he chnsiders good, wins top
awards in the show ring. More so when
the wine is medium priced, and is
bottled in huge quantities in relation to
the 'minimum gallonage required for
entry in the show. It is even more satis-
factory when the wine is a consistent
prizewinner over many years.
Such has been the case with our
Private Bin White Table wines at the
1968 Brisbane Show. These wines are
all blends, in the main Hunter River
Valley and Clare, sold under a constant
bin number, but showing the year of
vintage. By virtue of the blending, we
are able to maintain a fair degree of
consistency of style in the wines from
year to year, whilst consistency of
quality is our hallmark. Particulars of
the 1968 Brisbane Show results are:—•
BIN 11 MOSELLE (1967)
Silver Medal 1967 Vintage Moselle
Gold Medal Open Moselle Class
BIN 23 RIESLING (1967)
Silver Medal 1967 Vintage Hock
Bronze Medal Open Hock Class
Gold Medal Commercial Hock
BIN 64 CHABLIS (1967)
Silver Medal 1967 Vintage Chablis
BIN 36 PORPHYRY
SAUTERNES (1964)
Silver Medal Commercial Sauternes
Bronze Medal Open Sauternes Class
In attempting to describe the wines it
is first necessary to point out that all our
white table wines have certain common
characteristics, which, to us, are the
very basic criteria for quality, viz., a
freshness and grapeyness of bouquet and
flavor as the result of extreme care in
handling, and a strong “vinous” quality
which ensures long life for the wines.
Bin 23 Riesling is a light, delicate wine
with all the above characteristics, a
pronounced bouquet and flavor, and a
crisp, dry yet soft taste. Bin 11 Moselle
has most of the characteristics of Bin
23 Riesling, but is much fruitier on
both the nose and palate. Bin 64 Chab-
lis on the other hand, is a dry, crisp,
austere wine, much more restrictive in
its matching with food. Bin 36 Porphyry
is a luscious, sweet sauternes, with a
dryish end palate.
Matching Red Table Wines are Bin 45
Claret light and dry with delicate
astringency and Bin 50 Burgundy
round, soft, and smooth.


Letters
Helping Asia best
I wish to take delayed issue with the
policies advocated in “Help Asia’s
secondaries first” (8., May 4), which I
personally feel are completely misguided
and which can be construed as intended
for the principal advantage of Australia.
The post-war view of most developing
nations was “industrialise or die,”
whether they had essentially an agrarian
economy or not. Many such nations
have discovered to their costs that the
markets for their new industries have
not produced the incomes to pay for
food imports. These import bills have
often been increasing due to population
growth and relatively decreasing agri-
cultural outputs caused by starvation of
funds for agricultural development.
India is a good example of where
industry has developed at the expense
of agriculture. Lack of agricultural
growth aggravated by successive mon-
soon failures found India like many
other countries bound by the financial
chains of heavy loan servicing and debt
repayments. Fortunately, she has seen
the light and her development planning
has already moved to bring agricultural
development into a more balanced per-
spective with industrial development.
Optimistically she looks to the not-far-
distant future when there will be no
need to mortgage the economy for the
sake of heavy food imports.
The policy advocated of increasing
Australian agricultural production rates
to feed developing nations can too easily
be construed as one to provide more
profits for the Australian economy at the
cost of poorer nations. The greatest
assistance Australia can give in this field
is to offer its experience and knowhow
to these nations whjere it is most needed
for training their departmental staff and
farmers in agricultural techniques, farm
management, and extension services in
general, aimed at stepping up their
farming efficiency and overall food out-
put. In addition, training can be given
in food handling, storage, and treatment
techniques. These aims can be imple-
mented by seeking out suitable projects
for Australia to finance and staff or by
providing specialists for UN Develop-
ment Projects. This form of assistance is
being given at present, and the policy
should be to press ahead in this field
and not to resort to an increased food
export drive to countries needing
agricultural development.
Even in the unlikely event of your
correspondent having intended that
increased food production should be
given free to needy countries, this
would still be a disservice both to
the recipient country and to Australia.
Unreciprocated gifts cause embarrass-
ment to the recipient and do not lead
to better relationships, and more im-
portantly they do not in any way
assist the recipient to learn to stand
on his own feet.
I am not proposing that Australia
should reduce its efforts to provide
for itself a more efficient agricultural
economy or that it should cut its
overall food production. There are
many countries which can afford to
import the foodstuffs we produce. I
do contend, however, that the reasons
for increasing food production as set
out in this article are false and mis-
guided. Finally I must emphasise that
the views expressed here are my own
personal ones and do not necessarily
represent those of the organisation
for which I work.

Pharmaceutical benefits
Apparently you are unaware that on
National Health Service prescriptions
(Pharmaceutical Benefits, 8., August
17), which comprise more than 80 per-
cent of the scripts dispensed by retail
chemists, the Government allows a gross
margin on the price paid to the chemist
of 25 percent. Distinct from trading
margins, a small fee to cover profes-
sional services is also paid.
The 50 cents which the chemist, by
law, must collect from the patient
receiving a Pharmaceutical Benefit is
not retained by the chemist; it is the
Government-imposed “Patient Con-
tribution” toward the cost of the
prescription, and is deducted by the
Government when paying the chemist’s
claim for prescriptions dispensed. No
100 percent or 1000 percent “profit.”
Have you perhaps got all confused
about the price at which a public
hospital can buy drugs by the 1000
compared with what the retail chemist
charges when he dispenses the same
drug, maybe in tens or 20s?
Geoff Hervey-Tennyson

Relations Secretariat

Your column on “Pharmaceutical
Benefits Certain Excesses” is far too
sketchy to give a fair impression of
the situation. Costs in this field have
become a political football, and this in
itself, apart from the complexity of
the topic, is enough to ensure a lot of
misleading things being w'ritten. I can-
not attempt to do any more in this
letter than to mention a few other facts
indicating that there is much more to
this story.
Commonwealth statistics show that
the cost of the Pharmaceutical Benefit
scheme per person per day on some
of the 'more recent figures available
(1964-65) was 2.1 cents. Compare this
with spending on food, 66 cents, alco-
holic drinks, 18.1 cents, cigarettes, 9.3
cents, newspapers and books, 5 cents.
In these terms the cost does not look
so bad. Another factor is that although
many of these drugs are expensive
they do save enormous amounts by
reducing the demand for hospital beds
and reducing sick-leave time.
I am an owner-pharmacist, and I
would appreciate it if you could inform
me where to obtain that 1000 percent
mark-up! I do know that certain basic
sellers can be handled at handsome
mark-ups, if you are prepared to take
the risk of buying six months’ supply,
hoping that the drug is not displaced
by a newer one in the meantime,
because you can’t have a bargain sale
to clear stocks of outmoded drugs. Off-
setting these occasional opportunities
for a good mark-up are the many
occasions on which drugs are dis-
carded, or when one of the less com-
monly used drugs listed is procured
urgently and handled at a loss.

Kalgoorlie's "sins"
Poor old Kalgoorlie, the brothels and
the swy school again! (8., August 17).
The odd thing is that people can live
in that sinful atmosphere and be quite
oblivious to it. We did, for a year,
right in that street. The Brookman end,
of course. Lived in an old house with
the lane behind, offices on one side,
and a very cheap beds-to-let rabbit-
warren on the other. Which was prob-
ably full of swy supporters. We had
about eight doors and french windows
leading out of that house, none of
which locked very efficiently, so we
didn’t try, and left the back door open
for the cats’ convenience, anyway. Ai}d
I could walk home alone late at night
after Repertory Club rehearsals (all is
not beer and brothels on the Golden
Mile), with no danger of my motives
being mistaken.
Those brothels. Why do people go
all puritan over unofficially legalised
prostitution? And is it a crime, any-
way? Immoral, certainly, but surely
one cannot equalise sex-for-gain with,
say, pack rape, as your reporter seems
to do.
As for the two-up. What’s the moral
difference between gambling on poker
machines and gambling at two-up? At
least the swy school doesn’t lure with
bright lights and glittering luxury. It
is well and truly out in the scrub.
Actually, most of Kalgoorlie seemed to-
treat the “school” as a private joke.
Maybe, after all, your reporter’s
rather acid piece on the old town was
deliberately baited for bites. If so, I’ve
risen nicely to defend the Gold-
fielders, whose corrugated iron can be
as neat as any fibro cot. or brick bung.;
who have a certain toughness of spirit,
well laced with what is supposed to
be the Australian brand of dry humor,
but who can Be extraordinarily gener-
ous; whose morals are about as good
or otherwise as anyone else’s.
