Making an Army
The reader who wants to know all that
happens to a recruit who enlists in Kit-
chener’s Army, from the first “Squad—-
’shun!” to the finished product in the
charge, wall not miss The First Hundred
Thousand by lan Hay (Blackwood, per
Dymock’s Library). The trouble about this
volume is that there must be few who
haven't dipped into the story in Black-
wood’s Magazine, and found themselves
-wishing for more. lan Hay cannot help
being interesting, and he adds to a delight-
ful style an equally delightful humor. The
battalion —a Highland one —was the first
of the Service Battalions that was destined
to take its place alongside the Old Regiment
in the firing-line, and lan Hay takes his
reader, like a recruit, through all the details
of the arduous training, with many a witty
criticism of that dignified entity, the British
Army, and shows us the result being tri-
umphantly' tried out under fire. By the end
of the first chapter the reader is introduced
to a number of officers and men w r ith whom
he soon becomes on the most intimate and
friendly terms. And these friends are well
-worth making. To us, who nobly choose to
stay in mufti, this book brings a sense of
the making of an army out of a mob with-
out the possible discomfort of actually taking
part in that operation. And for those who
mean to enlist there is no other book on
the war, even including that popular,
but solemn, literary classic. Infantry Train-
ing, 1914, which will give them such invalu-
able sidelights on their job. The author of
that latter work. General Staff, whose ad-
dress is “War Office.” ought to prescribe
The First 100.000 as a companion manual
for every member of an officer’s class.
J*
lan Hay remarks that “the Great War
has been terribly hard on the text-books.”
Thus the text-book, written by General
Staff, before that invaluable officer met the
Hun, told you to put your trenches with a
good field of fire, and when not entrenched
advised you to take advantage of natural
cover, like farm buildings, etc., and insisted
on recruits being given practice in firing at
long range. But General Staff came back
from the Front with some revises in his
proofs. The amended version is: Never to
place your trenches where you can see the
enemy a long way off. If you do, he will
see you and shell you out of them. You
need not be afraid of being rushed : a field
of fire of 200 yards will be sufficient to wipe
him off the face of the earth. Never take
cover in farm buildings, etc., or any place
likely to be marked on a large-scale map.
Their position and range are known to a
yard. Your safest place is the middle of an
open plain or ploughed field. In musketry,
concentrate all your energies on taking care
of your rifle and practising “rapid.” You
will seldom have to fire over a greater dis-
tance than 200 yards. “When we go out on
service only three things will count —to
march; to dig ; and to fire, on occasion, 15
rounds a minute.”
It is pleasant to learn that in England
they have their Liverpool camps, too. Mud-
splosh Camp “consists of 300 wooden huts,
in all stages of construction. .. .The huts
are heated with stoves, and will be delight-
fully warm when we get some coal. They
are lit —or rather wired for —electric light.
There are numerous other adjuncts to our
comfort—wash-houses, for instance. These
will be invaluable, when the water is laid
on.... There is a spacious dining-hall; and
as soon as the roof is cm, our successors, or
their successors, will make merry therein.
Meanwhile, there are worse places to eat
one’s dinner than the floor —the mud out-
side, for instance.”
The camp has its steriliser, working over-
time. It does not sterilise anything but
blankets. “Yes, quite so. When blankets
are passed from regiment to regiment, in a
camp where opportunities for ablution are
not lavish, these little things will happen.’
As Private Hogg discovered, the steriliser
does its best, but that is all. Examining his
blankets after the operation he remarked,
on observing the presence of his familiar
friends still in the blankets, “Aye; but they
must have gotten an awfu’ fricht!”
The effect of military training on the
recruit is aptly likened to the experience of
the rivets in Kipling’s story of The Ship
that Found Herself. “He no longer gets
drunk from habit. When he does so now, it
is because there were no potatoes at dinner, or
because there has been an unattended leak
in the roof of his hut for a week, or because
his wife is not receiving her separation allow-
ance. Being an inarticulate person, he finds
getting drunk the simplest and most effective
expedient for acquainting the powers that be
with the fact that he has a grievance. For-
merly, the morning list of ‘drunks’ merely
reflected the nearness or remoteness of pay-
day. Now, it is a most reliable and invalu-
able barometer of the regimental atmos-
phere.”
Jt
So, from “Blank Cartridges”—the long
period of make-believe, the author goes to
“Live Rounds” —the real thing, and reminds
us at the conclusion of the first part that
the forthcoming of the second part will de-
pend upon the author’s eye for cover.
(Luckily it was good.) One of the experi-
ences of the company is the digging of a
redoubt at night. The men are warned,
when getting the earth, not to dig deep. They
soon find the reason. The place is full of
little wooden crosses.
“ ‘Germans,’ said the Engineer.
“‘How long have they been —here?’
“ ‘Since October.’
“ ‘So I should imagine,’ said Blaikie, with
feeling. ,
“ ‘The crosses aren’t much guide, either.’
continued the Engineer. ‘The deceased
are simply all over the place. The best
plan is to dig until you come to a blanke
There are usually two or three to a blanket.’
“To-day, out here, bombs are absolute
dernier cri. We speak about rifles anc
bayonets as if they were so many bows ant
arrows.... In the hand-to-hand butcher
which calls itself war to-day, th
rifle is rapidly becoming demode. For lon
ranges you require machine-guns; for shor
bombs and hand-grenades The bomb offi
cer, hitherto a despised underling, has sue
denly - attained a position of dazzling em
nence....ln fact, he threatens to disput
the. pre-eminence of that other regimenta
parvenu, the Machine-Gun Officer.”
One curious result of this interminabl
trench warfare is the existence, at certai
hours of the night, of an informal truce
founded on the principle of live and let live
“It would be an easy business to wipe ou
that working party over there by the barbed
wire with a machine-gun. It would b
child's, play to shell the road behind th
enemy’s trenches, crowded as it must b
with ration-waggons and water-carts, into
blood-stained wilderness. But so long a
each side confines itself to purely defensiv
and recuperative work, there is little or no
interference... .After ail, if you proven
your enemy from drawing his rations, h
will prevent you from drawing yours. Then
both parties will have to fight on empty
stomachs, and neither of them, tactically
will be a penny the better.”
The attitude of the men at the front to the
cold-feet brigade at home is neatly illustrate!
from three points of view. One is that of
Captain Petitpois (which, of course, isn’t his
real name), a French liaison officer. He is
concerned about the attitude of the British
Government. His opinion is that the Cabinet
—“these assassins—these imbeciles—these
cretins” —should be shot. He is calmed down
only by the British officer’s explanation tha>
the Government and the Opposition are
merely a troop of comedians, playing their
old game of politics to keep the country
amused. The second point of view is thai
of Captain Wagstaffe, just returned from
short-leave in London. “The dear old coun-
try at large is its dear old self, as usual. It
is not worrying one jot about Conscription
or us, or anything like that. The one topic
of conversation at present is—Charlie Chap-
lin.”
“ ‘Who is Charlie Chaplin?’ inquired sev-
eral voices.
“Wagstaffe shook his head. ‘I haven’t the
faintest idea,’ he said. ‘All I know is that
you can’t go anywhere in London without
running up against him. The mention of
his name in a revue is greeted with thunders
of applause’....”
And the third comment is made by Pri-
vate Mucklewame, when he heard of the
Welsh coal-strike. “All the decent lads are
oot here.”
Is not that true of the strikers in Aus-
tralia whose demands hold up the manufac-
ture of munitions? It is not the Labor
party that is striking: all the decent lads of
the Labor party ate doing their duty at the
Front. It is the dregs of the Labor party,
the old,, the possessors of cold feet, who are
pretending to represent the depleted Labor
party here—by striking against the interests
of the decent element.
The book closes with a stirring and graphic
narrative of “The battle of the slag-heaps,”
when, at incredible sacrifices of life, The
Big Push was made at Loos.
It may be unpatriotic for this page to re-
mark that. The Queen’s Gift Book, pub-
lished in aid of Queen Mary’s Convalescent
Auxiliary Hospitals (Hodder and Stough-
ton ; 2s. 6d.), is, in art, literature and ap-
pearance, inferior to Melba’s Gift Book, pub-
lished in Australia; but patriotism hardly
extends to literary criticism. Of the 25 items
no. less than six are things that have been
printed before; and though names like Con-
rad, Barrie and Galsworthy appear, the con-
tributions from these authors are not likely
to appear in any collected edition of their
works. Hall Caine’s verses on “Woman” are
just the sort of verses one would expect Hall
Caine to write. Conan Doyle puts into verse
form, under the title “Ypres,” prosaic state-
ments such as these: “You held council at
your quarters, when the budding Alexanders
and the pickel-haubed Caesars gave their
reasons. Was there one amongst that bristle-
headed circle of commanders ever ventured
the opinion that a little town of Flanders
would hold you pounded here through all the
seasons!” The stories are ink and water,
and the illustrations, with few exceptions,
are of the colored Christmas-card variety of
popular art. But, of course, it’s all for a
good cause.
on‘/?/££l me r ty ” : Red Pa 9 e mentions (B.
20/1/16) that R. C. Mills got his D.Sc. in
London for a thesis on Australian colonisa-
tion. This leads me to say that Australian
Universities might do a lot more than they
are doing to encourage research work on
our history. There is an immense amount
of raw material to be worked up. I
know an underground dungeon in Hobart
choked with old State documents and records
ot every kind. Here there await unearthing
some of the most romantic and thrilling
chapters of our past. The same thing is
more or less true of records preserved in
every Australian capital. The sort of work
that can be done is shown bv Scott’s Terrb
Napoleon or Miss Phillip’s A. Colonial Auto-
nomy. It is about time that our own Uni-
versities offered scholarships and research
degrees for work on our own history. These
would be worth far more to us than prizes
for an accurate knowledge of the orations of
Demosthenes or the peculiarities of some
mediaeval despot.
A New Moon
J. Scouller, who is also his own publisher
(27 Salisbury-road, Stanmore, Sydney),
not only solves the large question, Life;
What and Whence Is It? but provides for
the Hun after the war. He is rather unkind
to the previous philosophers and scientists
who have attempted to define Life, because
none of them has hit upon the fact that
“organic evolution can only be explained by
assuming the existence of persistent psychi-
cal entities, clothed in material forms....
Only by adopting the theory of metem-
psychosis, or the transmigration of souls, is
it possible to explain the facts of organic
evolution.” Life, on this earth, depends
upon the sun ; but it arrived here in a much
more dramatic manner than we have hither-
to foolishly believed. J. Scouller sends us
the news direct from the front. It appears
that many millions of centuries ago war
broke out amongst the inhabitants of the
sun —for J. Scouller believes that beneath the
photosphere, which is all we can see of the
sun, there exists a solid terraqueous globe
inhabited by beings rather like J. Scouller,
and on the authority of Dr. Elliott he attri-
butes to the sun “the most delightful
scenery” and much more regular seasons
than we have here. And in the sun “a great
potentate (Satan), with his vaulting am-
bition, sought to have pre-eminence over the
powers and principalities which represented
true progress.” But he was defeated, and
“the continent which had been defiled by
him and his hosts was separated off from
the matter of the sun by means of volcanic
agency and sent whirling off into space in
the form of the planet which we now in-
habit.” Naturally from such beings those
monsters of the prime, with which Tennyson
has so long worried us, were spawned.
But Life is built up by the germ cell, and
the reproductive cells act in some respect
like intelligent beings. Now how did the re-
productive cell learn to do its work? “The
psychic entity represented by the germ-cell
must have derived its capacity as a result of
experience gained during a long succession
of former lives in connection with organisms
of a human or sub-human character.” Thus
each gamete, or reproductive cell, represents
a separate and distinct psychic entity capa-
ble of building up and controlling an organ-
ism similar to that of the parent from which
it was derived. Hence man is not a simple,
indivisible soul clothed with a material body,
but a composite being—a cellular commu-
nity—in which vast numbers of subsidiary-
lives contribute to the one communal life.
Thus man has no consciousness of any pre-
vious existence, for the consciousness of the
organism is not that of individual psychic
entities, but of a new collective community.
Death merely means the temporary dispersal
of these individual entities, which continue
to exist, because they have always existed,
and will ultimately form part of a new
human life.
However, this speculation is hardly as in-
teresting as the future of the Hun. This war
is the prelude to God's Kingdom on the
earth. But the Hun has shown himself quite
unfitted to inhabit a regenerated earth. “We
may be quite certain that Nature will see to
it that the enemy.kingdoms will have no part
or lot in the coming Kingdom of Heaven on
earth.... We can readily imagine that the
countries of Central Europe, as'well as parts
or Asia Minor, will be separated off the
earth, as the result of seismic activity, and
that these separated portions of the earth
will be cast off into space, where they will
constitute a new satellite which will' circle
round the earth as the moon now does.” J
Scouller argues from the scientific hypo-
thesis that the present moon was
thrown off from the earth, but he
neglects the fact that this happened
by tidal action when the planet was much
hotter. The Pacific Ocean is believed to
represent the large hole made when that con-
tinent swung off. _ Anyhow, when Central
Europe is hoisted into the firmament, it will
have gained a place in the sun, and the
Kaiser ought to be satisfied. But it would
be just like him to set about throwing lunar
Alps upon us every moonlit night.

Meself was visin’ early on a day for cuttin’

Now I’d hear the burn run an’ then I’d
hear the thrushes.
Young, still young! — an’ drenchin’ wet the

Wet the golden honeysuckle hanqin’
sweetly down;
Here, lad, here! Will ye follow where I

to bind together.
Come, dear, come! — an’ back along the burn
See the darlin’ honeysuckle hangm’ like

Quick, one kiss — sure, there’s someone at

summer thrushes.
Oh, that’s the Brabla burn, I can hear it

For all that’s fair, I’d sooner see a bunch

Run, burn, run! can ye mind when we were

Self-Roading
Rifles
.32, .35, .351 and .401
Calibers
Winchester Self-Loading rifles
are not cumbersome, compli-
cated or unsightly, but simple,
handsome and well-balanced
guns. Their use permits rapid
shooting with great accuracy and
on account of the novelty and ease
of their operation, they add much
to the pleasure of rifle shooting
either at target or game. For hunt-
ing game which is generally shot on
the run, a Winchester Self-Loading
rifle is particularly handy and effective.
The four different calibers in which this
type of Winchester is made are suitable
for hunting all kinds of game, the cart-
ridges they use being of the most modern
type, giving excellent penetration and great
shocking effect. If you are going to buy a
rifle look over the Winchester Self-Loaders.

A Natural Remedy
Time was when disease was thought to be due to the
direct influence of evil spirits, and exorcism and magic
were invoked to cast it out.
Science has taught us wisdom. The evil spirits exist
still. We call them “Disease Germs,” and they also
must be cast out. Once lodged in the stomach or
intestines, fever with its hallucinations, or biliousness with
its aches and pains, is the result.
ENO S ‘FRUIT SALT’
is the approved remedy for driving out disease germs.
Its action is quick and thorough. It clears the intestines,
rouses the torpid liver to new life, stimulates the mucous
membrane to a healthy action, and cleanses and invigorates
the whole digestive tract.
Be prepared for emergencies by always keeping a
bottle in the house.

done, how much better they would feel if they took Clements Tonic.
“I was worn out, always tired and ill. Medical advice suggested
1 must give up work at once; nothing but rest would save me, but I
could not rest, I had my work to do.
ti “I started to take Clements Tonic, and have felt a different person.
I m well, happy and strong, and I tell everyone how grateful I feel to
Clements Tonic for giving me neiv life.” " Yours truly,

Australia Riddled with
Deadly Kidney Disease
ALMOST EVERTfBODY COMPLAINING.
Kidney disease is most certainly on the in-
crease. Thousands and thousands of people
in the towns and villages of this country are
in terrible danger of deadly kidney disease.
This insidious disease creeps on, gradu-
ally getting a firmer and firmer grip, until
when it is too late the poor sufferer discovers
he has Bright’s Disease. Have you kidney
trouble? Do you know how to recognise
whether you are suffering from this or not?
Here are some of the symptoms of kidney
disease : Aches and pains in various parts of
the body, nasty taste in the mouth first thing
in the morning, constipation, cloudy and bad-
colored urine, general feeling of weakness
and irritability, puffiness under the eyes—
these are all symptoms of kidney trouble.
And then people who suffer from backache,
rheumatism, gout, sciatica, gravel, stone or
pains in the bladder, muscles and joints are
all suffering these pains through weak or
diseased kidneys, for these are the sure and
certain symptoms of kidney trouble.
All these things mean that the kidneys are
weak and diseased. They need strengthening
and making healthy. *

chemist at once and ask him for a 2s. 9d.
box of De Witt’s Kidney and Bladder Bills,
which are made expressly for kidney and
bladder troubles.
To cure rheumatism or any other form of
kidney trouble you must positively get rid of
the cause—the poisonous uric acid. Remem-
ber to do this a real remedy must pass
through the kidneys and the bladder and not
through the bowels, as most kidney pills do.
When you see the urine change to a muddy
bluish color —a feature which distinguishes
De Witt’s Kidney and Bladder Pills from all
others —you know beyond all doubt that they
have put their healing touch on the right
spot—the kidneys and the bladder. A won-
derful pill—straight to the kidneys—that is
why De Witt’s Pills give such amazingly
quick relief —every time. A permanent cure
follows in almost every case. Look for that
blue-colored urine.
They' will cure every one of the above
symptoms no matter how long or bow badly
you have suffered.

Rheumatism
The case of Rheumatism or Gout
which Kruschen Salts cannot benefit
has yet to be discovered. This
famous British remedy is also
recommended by Medical Men in
cases of Lumbago, Sciatica, Eczema,
Constipation, and Liver and Kidney
Disorders.
KRUSCHEN AT THE FRONT
Since the outbreak of the War, enormous
quantities of Kruschen Salts have been ordered
by, and delivered to the British Authorities, for
the use of the British Forces overseas and in
the Base Hospitals at Home. Kruschen Salts
are prescribed by Medical Men the world over.
THE WORD KRUSCHEN
The trade mark “ Kruschen ” is a legacy-
handed down from generation to generation of
the family of Evan Griffiths Hughes, the sole
Manufacturers of Kruschen Salts, and one of
the oldest firms of Manufacturing Chemists in
the County of Lancashire. Established 1754 —

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Moonlight March.
Far in the vale of the hollow moon,
Where the laughter lives upon leaf and tree,
Where the stars drop kisses and soft clouds
croon
A low wind-song to the purple sea,
It was there they came in their thousands
strong,
An army moving with measured tread,
The men who followed the drums of song
Through the conquering march of the ages
dead.
Breastplate of priest and sceptre of king,
Sword and gauntlet and trumpet blare,
Prow of ship to the east a-wing,
Lure of love and a woman’s hair,
Chatter of slaves in the market place,
Merchant clamor of credits gone—
All are a broken sandal lace -
To the breath of the singer that marches on.
Forty deep through the woods they came;
Forty sweet was their front of sound—
Orpheus wrapped in a robe of flame,
Sappho with crimson girdle bound,
Tall Musseus and Homer blind—
Bravely they marched in the moon-vale
white;
The stars blew kisses and night was kind
And the dream-sea sighed with its old
delight.
“Halt! Break off!” ’Twas a voice I
knew —•
Voice of a king by a right divine.
Laughter out of the branches blew;
White nymphs ran with their cakes and
wine.
Picnic under the hollow moon —-
Lone I stood in the shadowed throng;
And the soft clouds passed with their ancient
croon
Over the kings and queens of song.
Lone I stood ; and the gross life mine
Beat to flame in ray pulses red ;
But my lips of flesh could drink their wine;
I knew their speech and the words they
said.
For they were as we. and the world went by;
We are as they, and the lots are drawn ;
Schoolman and shopman haste to die,
And the man is dust, but the dream goes on.
Forty deep through the woods they go ;
Forty sweet is their front of sounds
New recruits in the hindmost row
Join in the march the white world round.
Chatter of slaves in the market place,
Merchant clamor of credits gone—•
All are a broken sandal lace
To the joy of the singer that marches on.

The Big Grey Ship.
Grey of the dawn and seagulls screaming,
Southern breezes tossing the foam,
Rising sun on the grey gums gleaming,
House on the hillside, someone’s home!
Soldier! Lord of the Merry Laughter!
Heart-courageous, steadfast, true,
Here’s “To-morrow and what comes after !”
Good-bye to the Big Grey Ship and You !
Grey, grey mist o’er the harbor falling,
Soft, mysterious, strangely sad,
Wheeling gulls from the gardens calling.
Where is my merry, brown soldier lad?
Dreams of kisses and last embraces,
All must go, there is work to do.
Here’s to the Girls with Smiling Faces
Who wave to the Big Grey Ship and You !
Grey of the evening. Night descending,
Stars obscured by a gentle rain,
Golden curls over knitting bending.
Weaving thoughts into purl and plain !
“Slip one, knit one, decrease to seven’’ —
God of the English, kind and true,
All that is good on Earth, in Heaven,
Watch over the Big Grey Ship and You !

Dreams.
There is no sadness in the dreams
I keep of you, >
But warm, sweet bushlands stage then-
themes,
And skies of blue ;
For yours, of all the hearts I know,
I knew was true!
Love of my love’s first spring; How bare
Earth sometimes seems !
Where is the joy we used to share
In hills and streams?
The sweet, fresh wonder that survives
But in my dreams!
Within a world that leaves its trace
On all who stay—
Fades freshness from both heart and face —■
I still delay ;
But Death forever shrines in you
Your girlhood’s day!
Though all are dead that shared the years
We knew of old,
Dead with the change that fair youth sears,
Turns warm hearts cold,
My heart still has its dreams of you—•
Dreams of pure gold !
You lie not where they laid you. I,
Closing my eyes.
Walk in the lands of memory,
’Neath wonder skies,
With you whose eyes are clear with that soft
speech
That knows no lies ! -
While my heart lives you live; and deep,
When death’s last due
Is paid, together we shall sleep.
The future’s view
Death bounds; yet all the dark is Heaven
Because of you!

THE GREASE TRAP AT THE WRONG
END.
In the midst of strikes, patriotic speeches,
rigmaroles about the bountiful harvest and
the vast amount of money in the country,
and Bill Higgs sitting down on gold ex-
ports, in case all the cash escapes to achieve
cigars and asparagus, Victoria, and inci-
dentally Australia, has been hearing some-
thing lately about the elusive job, The hole in
the cashbox and the p.n.; also, as’a side-line,
about the job that vanishes down the drain,
and the export of flirt and presenting the
foreigner with a greasy substance to anoint
himself and convert into dollars. The'frith
is beginning to disappear from the beer, and
because, among other things, Coiien is not
at the old address, and the war is mopping
up cash like a thirsty camel accumulating
water at the back of Bourke, and because
the expedient of drugging the community
wdth calamitous palliatives has been an
easy method of escape from work and worry
to a horde of successive politicians, Peacock
is short of doles and a lot of people are
going short of toil. And this in a State
which has expended over £70,000,000 on
“developing” itself, in which there was last
year a State and Federal expenditure of
£23,000,000, and where a million and a half
of people are inhabiting 87,000 square miles
of land (half of them jammed into Mel-
bourne), and have been alternately babbling
about prosperity and howling for a cheap
loaf. All of which are points, parts and im-
portant pieces of the discussion about how it
happens that with thousands of men going
off to the war, with a strike or something
like it breaking out every five minutes, and
the world and Australia yelling for the pro-
duce of land and factory and mine, for
brains and for skill and for brawn, the Vic-
torian should be forming frequent deputa-
tions to a Minister urging him, for Heaven’s
sake, to smoke Cohen out of his entrench-
ments, or raid the banks, or do any old thing
he could think of to get into debt so that the
cashbox might be distended and the public
paysheet remain the same copious document
as before. Incidental to all this is that
other Victorians formed up into a deputation
the other day and asked Tudor what he
thought of Australia sending away, over a
quarter of a million tons of ivool per annum,
of which half was not wool but of wdiich a
fifth of the residue was a very valuable com-
mercial substance, eagerly competed for by
manufacturers in Europe and America, put
to a score of uses, and some of it, either
neat or travelling under various disguises,
was sold back to Australian citizens. This stuff
is called lanolin. Practically the whole
world’s supply of it is captured from the
sheep’s overcoat in England and Europe, and
the capturing is done by work which Aus-
tralians didn’t do. That the value of the
grease is about £7,000,000 a year is only a
detail; so is the quite obvious fact that Aus-
tralians engaged in capturing lanolin instead
of standing aside to let the foreigner head it
off would not, amongst other things, have to
depend on Cohen. Nor would they be helping
swell the disastrous interest bill or load up
the swag for the Australian kid. They
would be doing something that counted in the
way of making the bill and the swag
lighter. They would be producing some-
thing better than debt. The demonstrations
outside Peacock’s office to send for Cohen
and the inquiry addressed to Tudor con-
cerning lanolin represent wholly irreconcil-
able theories about the job and the. day’s
wage and the path Australia is going to
follow. They are in conflict all over the
Commonwealth, and the kernel of it is in the
question whether Australians shall clean the
jumbuck’s covering and card it and mill it,
and annex that lanolin, or wait miserably
at the steps of the pawnshop.

The Bulletin is firmly of opinion that
if it were not for the limitations of chemi-
cal knowledge, lack of enterprise among ship-
builders and foreigners and the conservative
instincts of Cocky, the dairy industry in
Australia would still be where the wool and
wheat-growing industries are. Instead of
separating the fat from the fluid delivered in
the bucket by Strawberry, putting the pro-
ceeds up into pats and rolls of butter, mak-
ing cheese, converting the by-products into
sucking-pig and bacon, Australia would
have risen nobly to the occasion and
delivered floods of milk into vast marine
tanks for transport to London and Berlin,
where the contents would have been reduced
to their constituent parts, and some of them
carried back as ballast for feeding Melbourne
and Sydney. A splendid opportunity has
been lost to the foreign-trade brigade, through
absence of imagination —just as jobs are
being lost to Australians and effort wasted
and cash squandered through hanging on to
the weary old gags about development and
p.n.-promoted prosperity and bloat, instead
of realising that wealth has been slipping
through their fingers every year in the ship-
ments of wheat and ore, and wool and dirt
laboriously dragged alongside the steamer
and the windjammer. It is not wheat the
Englishman wants, but flour; not ore, but
refined metal; not bales of grease, but wool
or what is made from wool, and the stuff
that can be skimmed off the mess Australians
didn’t clean up. It is in working up the ore
he has, grinding the wffieat he grows and
utilising the by-products, handling the wool
clip with discernment of its use and possi-
bilities here on the spot instead of over
yonder, that Australians will find the way to
a self-reliance that shall be real and profit-
able.
A country which exports 531.436,8781 b.
of greasy wool (Knibbs’s figures for 1913)
and only 64,450,0861 b. of cleaned wool in a
year has not commenced to be industrially
sane. When it allows a valuable by-product
of the limited volume it docs treat to vanish
down the drainpipe it seems to have
decided on a policy of unexampled stu-
pidity. The waste on freight alone is
stupendous; the loss of employment enor-
mous. And the losses thereabouts only need
to be multiplied by the waste and losses that
are represented by thousands of miles of
land adjacent to railways yet only half
utilised or even actually idle; by the losses
caused through the steady destruction of
forests and the importation of immense
quantities of, foreign timber; by the waste
on minerals; by the pulley-hauling about of
great masses of vegetation and animal pro-
ducts ; by the relatively complete absence
of chemical and technical science from agri-
cultural and manufacturing processes—all
this can be reduced to a simple calculation
that reveals the why and the wherefore of
the beggarly device for staving off the con-
sequences of political failure by pawning
the future. The more money that is bor-
rowed and scattered about building elephant-
houses and flea-breeding emporiums and
superfluous railroads (and neglecting a rail-
road vital to Australia) the more men have
to be continually employed on this class of
work, living at the best from hand to
mouth and more or less nomadic. And
while that is so the opened lands of Australia
are to a great extent vacant places, and
industries which would absorb labor, to the
great advantage of individuals and the
economic strengthening of the nation,
remain—well, that brings wool and dirt and
lanolin into the argument again for pur-
poses of illustration. The foreigner reaps
the benefit of the madness. He gets what
Australia fools away at great expense to
herself; he turns it into sovereigns that are
usually minted in Australian gold—and then
he invests in an Australian debenture, and
Australians go on digging and “developing
their resources” and forgetting all about
lanolin and other things, and the interest
leaks steadily away to be invested in more
debenture and make the leak bigger than
ever before. Of course it is lunacy, and
eoually of course when the consequences
of the national folly to the men who
have earned their meagre living from the
proceeds of pawn being thrown out of a job
it is mighty hard on them. They are the
victims of a gigantic political fraud, prac-
tised by demoralised parties for the imme-
diate advantages of a passing moment. And
it has been a mighty treason to Young Aus-
tralia this demented evasion of economic
truth in an orgy of extravagance and
waste. But the job subsidised by Cohen
has got to stop some time, and so far as
The Bulletin is able to see the sooner it
ends the less emphatically will Young Aus-
tralia have to curse when he takes the lid
off. And as under the combined influence
of Kultur and the rush of the Allies for cash
it looks like reaching an abrupt stop in a
day or two, this paper suggests that to
start with the man in Victoria and else-
where whose job is beginning to wear a
preeari 3 aspect should make lanolin
the t« , of a loud sermon to be
delivers .1 to loan-mongering politicians
who have been aiding and abetting
lanolin and multitudinous other sub-
stances to leave the premises without a pass-
port. Sending out the “S.O.S. signal to
Cohen is likely to be a pathetic circum-
stance. Cohen has been complaining lately
of hardness of hearing, and only the other
day Treasurer Higgs received confidential
advice from London that all Israel might
become stone deaf if the explosion kept up
much longer.
THE SCAPEGOAT.
The greatest modern political convenience is
beer. Wherever it flows there is a moder-
ately decent chance of men becoming unruly
and walking through some of the outer
trimmings of the Ten Commandments, but
the worst rows ever caused by the consump-
tion of the stuff itself are a small circum-
stance to the steady and prolonged uproar
among the alleged moralists who see in it
the root of all evil. That uproar, which
can be calculated upon with something like
mathematical precision, is used by political
parties both for defence and attack. A
party desiring to shield its actions from
observation has merely to set the anti-liquor
agitation going with a full head of steam
and its noise will drown all minor voices and
concentrate the whole public attention on a
single point which in the sum of things
political and social is of altogether minor
importance. On the other hand, a party
desiring to hit its political opponents in a
vital spot sools the anti-liquor agitation on
to them with whoops and curses, and watches
to see them torn to pieces by the infuriated
person with the umbrella. Neither party
believes that the booze question is of
primary importance, or that the enthusiast
for thirst has a bite which is really venom-
ous; but all parties believe that Bung and
his assailant are valuable pawrns in the poli-
tical game, and as such to be used to secure
temporary victory. Amid all the wrangle
and noise and purposely-created confusion
Bung is apt to have a bad deal and the
public a still worse one; and at the present
moment, when the raging discord is reaching
its climax, it is up to that public to step in
and make it clear to the contestants that
their attempts to raise cyclones in wash-
hand basins have no chance of being treated
seriously.

The recent refusal of the Holman Gov-
ernment to make an earlier closing hour for
hotels than 10 o’clock may have been right
or wrong; but the hysterical persons who
see any link between this and the recent
riot in Liverpool and Sydney have a peculiar
sense of logic. The trouble began in the
morning and practically the whole of the
recruits in tw T o large camps had broken from
control while perfectly sober and before
liquor had taken any hand at all in the
game. W. A. Holman is, on the evidence,
not only right in saying that the nine o’clock
closing, which he refused to accept, would
have done nothing to remedy matters, but
might with perfect honesty have gone farther
and declared that if every pub in the County
of Cumberland had been closed, locked and
surrounded by a double guard of the driest
and holiest umbrellas, the outbreak would
have occurred just the same, and might even
have been aggravated by the fact that the
absence of beer was regarded as a just griev-
ance. The fact that the pubs were closed at
six o’clock on the night of the strike is proof
enough that the biggest reduction of boozing
hours suggested by the extreme party in Par-
liament would not have made the smallest
difference to the rioters. The trouble began
in cold blood, in bitter sobriety, and pub
hours have no more right to be blamed for it
than the railway time-table or the width of
Redfern tunnel. If all the beer in
Sydney had been buried in stone vaults
at the moment when the human tornado
struck the city it would have stood a big
chance of being torn from its place of seclu-
sion.
No kind of excuse can be offered for
mutiny; but some attempt to get at the
cause of it may reasonably be made by
persons who refuse to think through their
boots. To start with, the concentration of
enormous bodies of men within a few miles
of a city that looks at life easily and has
religious objections to anything in the way
of serious restraint is a policy which deserves
all the bricks that can be thrown at it. A
new mode of life is never so difficult among
new surroundings as it is when attempted
near the old familiar beat. It is tolerably
safe to say that if the big camps from which
practically all the trouble has come were
50 miles from Sydney there would have been
little enough to curse over; and it is still
more certain that if there had been a dozen
camps instead of two, the pride of each
bunch of trainees in its own share of the
war preparation would have overcome any
desire to make a loud noise or wag its
undisciplined tail in the face of authority.
But to make a camp so large that it has no
individual character of its own, and to
place it at a point where it is practically
a suburb of the city, is to cry aloud
for just the sort of trouble that "arrived
last week. This statement is not new,
nor is its discovery recent. To any-
body except those who had the power to
alter it and didn't it has been quite evident
for months that the military authorities
would never get the best out of the men
offering for service while they herded them
in huge mobs within a shilling train ride of
the place where they were in the life-long
habit of doing any blessed thing they
pleased.
* * * *
As far as the liquor question touches the
troubles of the big camp at all, its connec-
tion is to be found in the absence of the
wet canteen. It is plain horse-sense that
men accustomed to drink beer in their ordi-
nary citizen life will want a mug now and
again while undergoing a strenuous training
Rightly or wrongly, the pub is the sociai
centre of Billjim’s normal existence; and,
in the process of turning him into a soldier,
a soldier pub, which is a wet canteen, is
almost a necessity. With such a canteen
his life will centre in the camp ; without it
ho will spread himself over the whole civi-
lian beerscape and, even if he does not be-
come a nuisance to himself and others, will
be something less of a soldier when he
boards the transport than he easily might
have been made. The wet canteen is a
logical necessity in a State where liquor is
commonly used. If the State were under
a prohibitory law a dry canteen might be
in order; but there can be no sort of advan-
tage in denying to the soldier his own camp
pub when the ordinary citizen still has his
bar open at the street corner. The real
solution of the whole liquor problem lies in
the establishment of a system of public
ownership and control of booze. All the
outstanding evils connected with alcohol can
be traced to the fact that it is in the hands
of Private Enterprise. Yet the Common
wealth military authorities with the oppor-
tunity of nationalising the soldier’s drink
right to their hand fail to take advantage
of it; and a section of the fool public joins
in the cry to shut the pubs because the sol-
diers, having been driven into them by the
folly of those in charge of the military sys-
tem, occasionally get out of hand.
FIVE-BOB-A-DAY SOLDIERING AS
IT APPEALS TO NEBUCHAD-
NEZZAR, PIZARRO AND W
SMITH.
When Hezekiah, King of Judah, showed
his Babylonian visitors the treasures of the
Temple and let them peep for a wistful
moment into his own strong-room he was
sowing the seeds of trouble. The Babylonians
went home with tales that opened the eyes
of the Euphrates natives; and a generation
or two later the legend of Jerusalem’s gold
had grown so big by frequent telling that an
expedition was fitted out to make a raid on
the city and carry off the plunder. When
Pizarro saw a specimen of Inca gold, which
some wandering Indian had contrived to filch
away and carry to Panama, the glint of the
precious thing laid such a hold on the reli-
gious soul of the Spanish adventurer that he
felt bis sword itching in its scabbard to con-
vert the Empire of the Sun to a right regard
for holy things. Jerusalem found its safe
burst open and the Inca was toppled off his
throne because in each case unguarded
wealth had been advertised to a treasure-
hungry world. The moral is that it is a good
thing to hide your cash when in rough com-
pany and say as little as possible about the
wife’s habit of leaving her diamonds lying
around when you happen to be dining with
burglars. All. the same, it is difficult
to hide the marks of prosperity and to keep
up a pretence of poverty on a large scale.
Australia, among the world burglars who
use the 17-inch howitzer instead of the
centrebit, does not make a pretence of feeling
poor. Our five-bob-a-day soldiers walk openly
among the three-and-ninepence-a-week armies
of the world, and in a single day the city of
Sydney raises by subscription a sum equal to
three or four times the annual revenue of
one of the kingdoms engaged in. the big
European scuffle. All the world is taking
note ; and those portions of the world that
are hungriest and most reckless begin to feel
a religious call, like that which came to
Pizarro, to go and have a look at the place
where so much wealth is bred. The lure of
Australia becomes stronger. Vague fancies
about gold stacked under the trees or lying
loose about the doorsteps crystallise into vivid
dreams among the men who are wont to cut
a tough throat for a few coppers or sack a
maddened and brutally-resisting village for a
few* bushels of corn. Five-bob-a-day walks
before them in war-soiled khaki; and as its
thousands go by the enthusiast for plunder
makes his calculations about Australia and
resolves to get his hands into her shining
resources. From an advertising point of
view the whole thing is a perfect success.
* * » *
There can be no sort of doubt that the man
who has been properly impressed by the
vision of five-bob-a-day w T ill get to Australia
in some quantity. What it is important for
us to consider is whether he will come as
Nebuchadnezzar came to Jerusalem, as
Pizarro came to Peru, or as Bill Smith
originally came to the Illawarra. Nebuchad-
nezzar came along with an outsize in armies,
which paid no heed to Judah’s paltry
defences, and without troubling about Hague
conventions or international law helped him-
self to every saleable thing Jerusalem con-
tained. Pizarro arrived in Peru with some
crosses, a small band of devoted brigands
and a huge pretence of friendliness and mis-
sionary zeal; and succeeded in murdering,
robbing and converting to Christianity on a
magnificent scale. Bill Smith came to
Illawarra, bought land, milked a cow and.
despite the pestiferous foreign atmosphere o
the dairy-yard, learned to think Australian.
The arrival of a sufficient number of hi
Smiths may be a protection against the m-
vasion of a Nebuchadnezzar; P ro . t^ ctl y}
against Pizarro must be of a c *’ ,® re
nature. Unless the present war should iA
amazingly wrong and suddenly wheel so"
ward from the sack of Europe, it is to
ably certain that Nebuchadnezzar s at
will not occur immediately; though it
equally certain that the eye of the in
national plunderer must burn upon (® r |
food and mineral resources with a ba
light. Possessing such a country as -
tralia as a base, all the armies y. w
destruction could be fed and equipped hi• P

The modern adventurer is an( }
simple person, staying at a good n
smoking big cigars, but rounding l

His combination of stealth and kindness
fipceives even the expert m commercial rob-
hprv and when Courts and Commissions sit
upon him his lawyers and agents can gener-
ally contrive to prove that he does not exist.
Already Australia has some experience of
hinu but the huge advertisement of our
wealth and resources in the eyes of the
world which the war has made possible, and
The flaunting of a five-bob-a-day military sys-
tem in the faces of the sevenpence-halfpenny
patriots of other lands, will convince a still
more numerous Pizarro that there are Inca
shrines here to roh and Inca gold-mines to
exploit Our advertisement in the world
war thus works in two directions. It
whistles Bill Smith away from his slum or
fishing smack or barren acres to come and
make his home in a country that lies wide and
rich to the sun. and it pom-poms on a trom-
bone to the person who robbed Bill Smith
in other and narrower lands to extend his
field of operations to a realm where bigger
burglary is possible. It is one of our most
pressing jobs to see to it that such burglary
is made impossible. If Pizarro at his first
landing, when his tired, disreputable and pro-
perly-scared followers crawled ashore on the
unknown coast of Peru, had been met by a
regiment or two of the Inca’s best troops
there would have bee.n no slaughter at Cajam-
arca and no overthrowing of that strange,
mild, socialistic despotism by Spanish bar-
barians. It is right at the landing that
Pizarro must be met every time. In one
American city there is no Beef Trust because
the butchers of that place held a meeting,
and by resolution decided to shoot at sight
any person remotely suspected of having any-
thing to do with the big concern. That is
the one effective means of dealing with
Pizarro. Pie must be shot at sight—with a
legislative twelve-inch gun if possible; but
shot, in any case, even if there is nothing
better to fire at him than the garden roller. In
the coming of Bill Smith in quantity to
Australia lies our great hope of defeating the
open attack of Nebuchadnezzar; but we
shall never succeed in that larger task if we
let Pizarro make good his landing and drain
the resources of the country white for his
own gain. About our defence against Nebu-
chadnezzar we can do little till the present
war is over; but if we wait until the guns
cool to stop Pizarro, his grip will be on our
throat and his hand on our cash pocket at
the very moment we are cheering for the vic-
tory his coming has made barren.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Representing Australia.
li’ is a feature of our alleged modern demo-
cracy that everybody who makes sufficient
noise “represents” somebody or something.
Oeorge Reid, presented with a Tory
seat in the House of Commons, talks about
representing Australian interests; yet his
constituents would rise as one infuriated
coat-of-arms and tear him out of his eye-
glass if he even suggested to them one notion
that is honestly and distinctively Austra-
lian. But Reid is in no danger of doing
anything of the kind; although he never
discovered Australia, Australia long ago
round him out. Andrew Fisher is perhaps
a shade more in touch with our ideas ; but
to say that Fisher, oozing porridge and
1 resbyterianism in every syllable, can repre-
sent Australia is to utterly mistake the
position. Others whose claims are even
more mysterious occasionally misuse lan-
guage to declare that they are in some sense
Australia’s representatives. The so-called
* ustrahan colony in London —men who ex-
i 11 t .this continent with sheep or took
oil ot its mineral wealth, but regarded it as
oo poor a place for permanent residence —
ccasmnally step into the limelight as those
? se >deas are expressive of the strong life
rider our own broad sun; and even the
- luoded Carson was proposed recently by
u° n ne wspaper as the head of a party
tch among other minor jobs was to
repre Sen t the Australians.” All such talk
mia ■ u.tha n the remarks of the honorary
f. Ir .*. niS , cat on the house roof. In plain
a democracy w r orthy of the name can
never be represented by a man or a party.
It can be represented only by itself.
Once in the eyes of the world has Aus-
tralia been represented fully and honestly.
It was on the morning at Gaba Tepe when,
set to the task that war authorities deemed
impossible, the men of the Commonwealth
made their historic onslaught with a spirit
that will ring down the endless road of His-
tory. The strenuous, casual, lighthearted,
irreverent voice of this continent was heard
there above the roar of all the guns, and
the world sat up and observed that this was
not. at all the kind of thing that it had been
led to expect from what it had previously
seen of the country’s alleged representatives.
The severe months that followed bore out
all the promise of the landing. War writers
have showered their praises upon the men
who held _ the trenches and almost made suc-
cess possible in spite of ill-devised strategy.
Any number of people are found to-day who
acclaim the fact that the Australian has
proved himself one of the best and most
resourceful fighters on this planet; yet all
the alleged representation of this continent
in the past gave no inkling of the fact; and
only when a section of the nation itself
stepped forward to attend to the job did the
world’s imagination lay hold of the idea that
the Australian people were something quite
out of the ordinary. But if representa-
tion of Australia has been a poor
business abroad it has been equally
farcical at home. From the Federal
Parliament to the municipal council in the
suburbs, the men elected to the jobs of legis-
lation and government are never representa-
tive of the people who give them place and
power. A few dozen conspirators in one
shady corner select a candidate, and a score
of other intriguers in a murky retreat select
somebody else, and the choice at the ballot-
box is between these two. The bulk of the
electors may have no use for either of them;
but have to swallow one or the other. As a
result of this maddening system, men go
into Parliament or one of the lesser cata-
combs representing nobody but the handful
of people who formed the majority upon their
selection committee. They are not repre-
sentative in any fruitful sense, and strangers
may be pardoned if they misunderstand a
nation which persistently wears its hat on its
feet. In actual fact a democracy cannot be
represented except by itself. Australia, as
the mistress of a continent, can employ
certain of her citizens to write her laws,
keep her accounts and carry on the regular
routine of business; but the big things that
really count must come from the people
themselves. The machinery to do this is
neither complicated nor expensive. On the
platform of the Labor party, or hidden
away somewhere in the cracks of its exposed
timbers, is a proposal to establish the Refer-
endum with Initiative. That proposal, if
carried into law, would place the direct
power of doing things in the hands of all
the people. There would be no waiting until
the time was ripe or the potato cooked, but
when Australia desired to make a law that
law would be made swiftly. We need
a Gaba Tepe on Australian soil, and we
can’t get it until the Referendum with
Initiative gives us the word to rush the
trenches and drive out those who block
national progress.
The Army that Came to Town.
The sequence of events at the big Liverpool
(Sydney) training camp had gone this way:
Muddle.
Chaos.
Royal Commission.
More Chaos.
Change of Command.
Men placed on their honor to behave.
Fight, bash, booze.
General Me Cay arrives and makes remarks.
Men assured they must work or be fired.
And it stood at that until the begin-
ning of last week, when the contents
of the new camp at Casula emptied
themselves' into .Liverpool and announced
that they were going on strike against 40
hours of drill per week. Whereupon the
available Liverpoolites said “Good enough”
and likewise went on strike and, after
tearing the innards out of the local
pubs, abandoned the remains and, com-
mandeering the railway service, advanced
on Sydney in thousands. What super-
vened in the city was _ just plain
horseplay, highway robbery, riot, larrup and
annexation of beer, followed by desperate
collisions with multitudinous John Hops,
charges by mounted troopers, and smashed
heads. By night-time the gleam of bayonets
was in the streets, ball cartridge had been
served out to a regiment camped on the Show
Ground, shots had been fired into a mob of
rioters at the Central Railway Station, the
casualties being one killed and eight
wounded. Two thousand men on police and
picket duty were at that stage struggling
with the situation. It was one of the most
amazing outbreaks Australia has experi-
enced. The disgrace—a poor, futile word
in the circumstances —goes a long way beyond
the men directly concerned ip the disturb-
ance. The system under which troops are
raised for service contributed to it. The
throttling of the newspapers and Parliament
had led to damming up conditions which had
to burst. From the start the state of affairs
at Liverpool has been scandalous. Evidence
of this has been daily before the eyes of
Sydney in what was lurching about the
streets and was officially corroborated first
by the findings of Justice Rich and more
recently by the reported utterances of
General McCay. The development has been
steadily in one direction —from bad to worse.
Neither the public nor the recruits were able
at any time .to detect any sign of
official recognition that men were con-
centrated at Liverpool for the stern
and arduous business of preparing for
participation in a desperate war, in
which personal and collective fitness and dis-
cipline are essential to effective service. The
bell wethers of the big rumpus will
probably be rooted out and punished. They
ought to be. But unless Minister for De-
fence Pearce can get himself out of his
habitual frame of mind of being “very
pleased,” knock off carrying on a long-range
squabble with Holman, and apply himself
to the job of tidying up the mess at the
’•ieht nlace with as much thoroughness as he
has displayed in making the censorship an
effective instrument, the better for all hands
except the Hun. An army going on strike is
a fairly bizarre circumstance, but it isn’t
explained by remarking that some anonymous
ruffian suggested raising Cain on the
premises as a patriotic method of helping the
enemy. It more forcibly suggests that some-
one higher up ought to be seriously consid-
ered.
The Somewhat Numerous Watt.
The standards of personal and national
usefulness are getting more mixed than
ever. Watt, M.P., formerly Victorian
Premier, is a case in point. Watt’s posi-
tion has been a • subject of . discussion by
others and earnest consideration by himself
for quite a long time. At the beginning of
things there was a yarn about him having
consulted another politician and been
assured that he was more useful as Watt,
M.P., than as Private Watt or Colonel
Watt or any other Watt behind a gun.
He accepted the verdict, and the matter
stood at that until the other day in Mel-
bourne when at a recruiting rally someone
put it up to him once more. “I have on my
card,” explained Watt, “intimated my
readiness to enlist when I see that by doing
so I will be giving more useful service than
I am doing now.” Watt has an exagge-
rated idea of a talker’s importance. What
he is doing now is to speak with great fervor
to the multitude, frequently telling it . to
wake up, get a move on, realise the situation
and otherwise do the right thing. He is
doing this very well; but there is no pos-
sible argument to justify a man in pre-
ferring to be a seven-horsepower recruiting
agent instead of a one-horsepower soldier.
There are hundreds of elderly men in
Watt’s electorate who can say all he is
saying. There are perhaps thousands of
women who can say it even more effectively,
and unless there happens to be some sound
military reason for Watt not letting them
have the platform while he is measured for
a soldier’s suit he ought to be where he is
telling other men they should be found.
Less than to any other man in a democratic
community is it open to a member of Par-
liament to say, when the life of a nation is
threatened, that his place is on the. stump
rather than in the trench. On him the
obligation of being first in the performance
of civic duty rests heavily, and unless he
discharges it he is merely helping to accu-
mulate evidence of the politician’s social
inferiority. Winning an election entitles
him to a salary, a free pass on the railways
and a seat in Parliament; but there is noth-
ing in the contract, explicit or implied, that
he can thenceforward regard himself . as
exempt from the first and most vital
national duty. There is quite a consider-
able number of Watts in Australia’s mul-
titudinous Parliaments, and the time is
about ripe for them to consider themselves
in relation to their job, their country and
their fellows. From bush, station, mine,
factory, school, office and shop Australians
have gone to fight for freedom. They are
men who are helping to do the work of
humanity. And the humblest of them is a
better Australian, a more useful citizen and
the player of a finer part in the nation’s
business than the frequent Watt of
verbal fluency. The man who thinks that
addressing meetings is as useful as address-
ing a few pointed bayonets to the Hun and
the Turk has got things upside down.

The Hob-nailed Patriot.
In the midst of frenzied appeals to chuck
Germans out of billets and consider methods
to forever smash enemy trade it would not
be amiss to turn slight attention to the fact
that Australia is a rich country that, like
all other countries, isn’t going to get any
benefit out of its riches if its people don’t
work. It may not be altogether unreason-
able to suggest that a man, even if of enemy
extraction, who quietly and conscientiously
keeps on doing the toil he is paid to do, is
not at the present moment such an enemy
to this country as a native-born patriot who
howls for the other man’s removal from his
billet and won’t keep working in his own. In
point of fact, insomuch as the person of
enemy extraction who keeps steadily at his
job is assisting in the creation of British
wealth, he is considerably more of an enemy
to Germany than the native-born person
who frivolously and persistently keeps on
spragging the wheels of production. The
eventual issue of the war; the progress and
prosperity of this country and the Empire;
the chance of Australia rising from the posi-
tion of a huge, helpless, sparsely-settled con-
tinent, only saved from immediate invasion
by the shadow of the British flag, into a
mighty, homogeneous white nation, capable
of dictating within its dominions any policy
ir desires, and of initiating any conditions
(industrial or otherwise) it cares for, and
of upholding and enforcing by its own might
such conditions regardless of conflicting
ideas in the outside world —all these mat-
ters and many more rest ultimately on the
same sound and vigorous development of the
resources of Australia, coupled with those
of the rest of the Empire. Many of them
rest absolutely on Australia’s shoulders, and
if the nation does not cast adrift trivialities
and settle down to urgent business the time
will assuredly come when all the rest of the
Empire will not be able to save it from the
result of its own asininity. Most wage-
earners clearly recognise that a day’s wage
lost is a day’s wage gone, and snort vigor-
ously about broken time; and what must
the verdict be upon a country which has
enormous indebtedness already incurred, and
perhaps incalculable burdens ahead, and
yet, while fortunate enough to escape within
its own boundaries the horrors and devas-
tation which equally innocent nations have
groaned under, fritters away its time in
strikes and industrial deadlocks and poli-
tical pettifogging? No one would deny that
now is a time when every brain should be
active in devising better systems and methods
of production, when every available bit of
brawn and muscle should be put to best use
in turning raw material to valuable pro-
ducts for local or oversea needs : yet what
unprejudiced observer could honestly say
that at present the state of domestic affairs
in Australia showed unmistakable signs of
such a single-minded and patriotic purpose?
Now, if ever, is the time for every citizen,
legislator or commercial magnate or miner
or navvy to recognise and translate into
action the fact that the future of this
country rests primarily on good, honest,
hard graft—not the graft of American
slang, but the decent, self-respecting toil
that the word signifies in the land of the
Southern Cross ; and if even the immediate
personal or financial advantage seems some-
what inadequate, national and individual
needs alike are in the long run going to be
best conserved by mingling a little patience
and common-sense with desire, and trusting
to time and a bit of battling to bring about
a remedy. The principle of attempting to
get a large share of the output by stopping
as much of it as possible is infinitely
inferior to that of increasing it and annex-
ing the surplus.

The Religious Editor’s afternoon sermon :
When I came to the gates of the ill-kept city I
found the walls pasted over with proclamations or
appeals. The first one I saw read “Pay Your
Taxes. Your King and Country Need the Money.”
Close by it was another in different colors: “This
Man Has Paid His Taxes! Have You Paid Yours?”
Further on was a third: “Will You Wear Your
Country’s Receipt?” While I was examining these
curious things an ill-kept, hungry-looking fellow
thrust a bill into my hands. It was apparently
a playhouse advertisement, for it had scrawled across
it, “Theatre Royal To-night; ‘O’Taxpayer, V.C.’
A Thrilling Story of Duty Nobly Done. Performed
by Royal Command before His Majesty. Note:
During the performance the company will sing the
song of the moment —‘Will You Lay Down Your
Cash for the Flag?’ ” Accosting one of the inhabi-
tants I asked: “What means this pasting up of
paper?” After eyeing me narrowly, he answered:
“Stranger, in this free city we are volunteers in
everything. No man, woman or child does or pays
anything by compulsion. We prefer to trust to the
people’s better feelings and to quicken same when
necessary by making a public appeal. All this
paper that you see pasted up is a sign that we are
a little short of money and want the people to know
it. Every taxpayer who nobly comes forward and
pays what he owes gets a medal and his portrait in
the papers, and everybody looks up to him —or down
at him, if the looker happens to be in an upstair
window when the national hero goes by with his
cheering crowd of admirers. There is a play on
now about a man who not only paid his own taxes
in full, but paid them so publicly that all the people
in his street were almost moved to pay theirs too.
You may think perhaps that this is a wasteful and
roundabout method of getting people to do their
duty, but we prefer to have if so. Of course these
frantic appeals cause a good deal of irritation to
the people who don’t pay, %nd I must admit that a
proportion of our national heroes get swelled head
after being thoroughly lionised. A visitor of many
years ago made himself very unpopular by pointing
out that to us a man who merely paid his dues
to the State was made a demi-god, instead of merely
getting a receipt with a cancelled duty-stamp on
it. Then he said something unnecessary about the
demi-god being made to keep .the sponging loafers
who cheered him. I believe he came fremi a wealth-
conscripted country where it was not considered
sensible to have fireworks, bands and cheering round
the Treasury pay-desk. A horribly unemotional hole
I should say. Of course we have our ideals here ;
but we don’t get them shop-worn by forcing them
into everyday use. We believe that every citizen
owes something to the State, and that a lot of the
inhabitants are too dull to realise their duty; but
we will not have them bullied and coerced in the
courts. Our method causes the city to look very
dilapidated at times; but we have the glorious feeling
that Freedom —or something like it —is being fur-
thered and all that sort of thing. If we ever have
a war we intend to proceed on the same glorious
plan of allowing the willing citizen to go out and
get beaten flat while we stay behind and appeal for
more citizens to go out and stop it.” “That seems
very rough on the willing citizen,” said I. “Not at
all, sir!” said my informant; “the stricken hero
will get a medal and a great deal of adulation
and everybody will tell him he is much superior
to all other men.”

A deputation of telegraphists who waited
on Postmaster-General Webster with a
kitful of grievances packed up the Wheat-
stone automatic with the rest and explained
to WebsTer what they thought about it.
The grumble was not that the contrivance
was inefficient nor that it had a habit of
spilling lumps out of a telegram on the
journey, but that it tended to do away with
labor —“threatened to close the avenues of
promotion.” Therefore, said the lightning
jerkers, out with it and get back to the old
hand-worked system. If these telegraphists
had read of a deputation of farm-workers
asking for a return to the scythe-and-sickle
method of acquiring the Australian harvest
they would perhaps have been staggered ; yet
their own petition is parallel. Belonging to
a class of toilers who by the slow grind of
seniority have far to go to rise to managing
a branch office, they naturally enough look
on the new idea with the sour visage, and
this system operating through the service it
is not very surprising that Australia’s
methods are mostly those of last century.
With all its faults the auto, is the only pos-
sible means of coping with telegraph traffic.
More than five years ago it was clear that
hand propulsion was hopelessly inadequate
to grapple with the accumulating business.
Necessity compelled the introduction of the
Wheatstone, and talk of returning to orig-
inal methods is about as sensible as a pro-
posal for ripping up the car lines in Sydney
and Melbourne and goinsr back to the lum-
bering omnibuses.

The Consul-General for Italy in Australia
has notified the Defencq Department that
local unnaturalised Italians are eligible for
enlistment in the Expeditionary forces if
they are of military age and fitness. They
are eligible for service with the army or
navy of Italy, but ' Italy is not taking
measures to get them to the war; so they
are practically in the same position as the
“na uralised” Germans in - our midst who
stay in prosperity and peace in Australia,
whilst men of British and French, descent
are going out to help their compatriots in
the field and save civilisation. Unnatural-
ised neutrals of pro-German sympathies are
also eligible for service on behalf of their
respective Fatherlands, and are therefore
disqualified for enlistment here. So the
longer the war lasts the greater becomes the
proportion of alien residents of military age.
The anomaly needs attention. No able-
The Cruisers.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The clear night-skies were splendid,
Their purple lit by stars,
And Ocean’s distance ended
It seemed, on cloudy bars,
Where eastern skies were laden
With radiance rich, that told
That soon the red moon-maiden
Would flood the seas with gold.
Out of the distance dimly
The battle-cruisers grew-—•
Swiftly they came, and grimly,
Black hulls against the blue.
Out of the night emerging.
It seemed, if such might be,
That some sea-god was urging
Their hulls across his sea.
Huge shapes they were, all lightless,
And breathing smoke that trailed
And made the white stars sightless—
Far stars that shrank and paled,
To hear the muffled thunder
Of driven hulls that came —
The great screws churning under.
Flogged like a wind-choked flame.
From dim-lit decks there sounded,
Anon, clear bugle-calls
That thrilled with thoughts unbounded,
By roofs and ringing walls ;
High into Night’s far spaces
Their lonely echoes went
To touch the stars’ white faces
And stir the firmament —
To tell the Night’s dark daughters,
Speaking with quiet lips,
That Britain ruled the w’aters
And these were British shins —
To bid the sea-winds carry
This message far and wide —-
That none shall bite or harry
Where British cruisers ride.

whole question of alien strains of population

The Sudden Arrival of a Bear.
While Everyone was explaining to Every-
body what was going to happen next and
where it was to take place, and who was
going to do it, one of the few big things that
have been pleasant for the Allies occurred
out of earshot. When the echo arrived
Everybody had to turn round in a great
hurry and rush off for an atlas. That it is
a big thing looks pretty certain even if the
usual discount be allowed. In the news
from Flanders at the time there was nothing
to call for applause. The American note
issue had become a whirling tornado of words.
The campaign in Mesopotamia seemed no
better, and Billjim was variously reported
to be pursuing something with a strange
name over the skyline in Tunis, and the rest
of him was allegedly rushing off to Salonica.
In the midst of a tangled nightmare of
dispatches about nothing the Bear was sud-
denly heard bounding off the Caucasus and
springing violently on top of the Turk at
Erzerum, w*hich is in Armenia, and over
beyond the snowy mountains into which the
Unspeakable had dug himself in. Apparently
Abdul was expecting Ivan to laboriously
arrive with siege artillery by the side gate,
but it appears that the Russ silently sneaked
up over the local avalanche and was stream-
ing inside with frozen whiskers and a
bayonet before the son of the Prophet knew
what was happening. The rest of the story
is one of bolting Turk and pursuing Russian
and loud hurrahs from everywhere except
Potsdam. A side-line is what appears to be
a vastly improved state of affairs in the
direction of Bagdad and Suez. It was nearly
time. If the Russian can keep the pressure
going on the Turk and the Anglo-Indian
army gets into effective operation south-
wards the Unspeakable should soon be hav-
ing something of first importance to think
about, and be fairly thankful that Gallipoli
is off his hands. Meanwhile there has been
some mild discussion about the army Aus-
tralia is leisurely raising, and the general
tone of the talk has been that the casual
level is being reached. * Unless such a step is
contrary to the War Precautions Act there
seems fairly conclusive evidence that the
time is ripe for getting more than a casual
move on. The published figures—and they
are only part of the story—are not encourag-
ing.
“Pick”: # When people at Bungendore
(N.S.W.) three years ago formed them-
selves into a Closer Settlement League with
the object of securing a slice of the encircling
big squattages, the members of the Closer
Settlement Board, who visited the locality,
declared it “unsuitable for mixed farming.”
Very well. Last week one farmer there-
abouts harvested 85 bushels of oats per
acre; another stacked 60 tons of hay from
three acres; was secured for greasy
merino; 10 trucks of fat bullocks were re-
cently acquired at £l9 a head; also there are
splendid crops of potatoes, tomatoes and
fruit, and dairying is profitably engaged in
where the big runs haven’t pinched the room.
Now what is necessary for mixed farming?
Tassy has just heard the painful news
from the Public Works Department that a
railway survey has cost over £2OO per mile;
that four miles of railway have been built
at an expenditure of £ll,OOO in money and
six months in time for each mile; that the
Department has spent five years and over
£2OOO in trying to remove a rock at King
Island, and is now further off the end of the
job than when it started; that the whole
Department is in a most frightful muddle;
and that the salaries of most of the officers
of this Department are paid out of loams!
In handling stores the Department is a
world’s champion. No records have been
kept of the goods issued on some works; on
the Don-Melrose tram 3150 rails were re-
ceived from store, but only 37 can be traced
as having been handed out; 18,275 sleepers
came in, and 25 were accounted for in the
books. Of 278 bags of oats 227 were not
accounted for, and of 343 bags of chaff 99
were found in the store. No one possessed
a clue to the whereabouts of the odd 244.
Generally speaking, the habit of this awful
Department had been to send an officer round
to buy timber, horses, bullocks, chaff and
sundries, and then get a list of the prices to
be paid, but latterly even the list was not
bothered about. As the official report ob-
serves : “All the stores may be legitimately
consumed and everything may be absolutely
all right, but there is nothing to show it.”
Which is vague and unsatisfactory.

Ashmead Bartlett lost all his final “g’s”
and the attention of the audience in the
back seats, who could hear him only with
considerable strain, at his last lecture at
Sydney Town Hall on Saturday evening. Bart-
lett is a smart journalist who has been well
paid to pose as a lecturer. Again and
again, after a stirring statement, he crushed
the tentative applause by tagging on to his
period a weak and unnecessary* clause. And
he told nothing new to those of the audience
who have read his, and other, despatches.
His lantern pictures of Anzac, however, gave
a better idea of that Australian out-back
selection than his own descriptions. But,
nowadays, the lantern slide is painfully
stationary compared with the cinematograph.

For those Melbourne people who are at
all worried by the question of Hamlet’s state
of mind before and after his conversation
with his father’s spirit the present perform
a nee at the Princess’s should be a first-class
attraction. The melancholy Dane is a very
real person this time, brooding suspiciously
over the circumstances of his parent’s de-
cease until the ghost comes to state the
facts of the case, which puts him somewhat
off his “block.” A haunted, irresolute young
man, who is neither too mad nor too thea-
trical, considering that he was always in-
terested in plays and players. If Shak-
speare had any very definite intention m
his creation of his most famous character
this is probably the most reasonable inter-
pretation of it. To a considerable propor-
tion of Saturday night’s audience “Ham-
let,” alas! was only an improved Marlow-
drama. Although they didn’t know that
Germany long ago claimed Immortal Wil-
helm for its own, these unsophisticated
critics seemed chiefly struck by the Teutonic
thoroughness of the author’s methods. Shak-
speare was the Kaiser of tragic drama. His
kultur was merciless. Ilis motto was
slaughter. He drew Ills quill from behind
his ear (as the Kaiser drew his precious
sword from Its scabbard) and dipped the nib
in blud. “Hamlet” is an ancient domestic
family tragedy. There are two families, and
little else, in it —the Fontinbraves and the
Poloniouses. And where are they when the
curtain falls for the last time? Out of action.
Every member of them has been murdered,
manslaughtered or extinguished. The head
of the Fontinbrav family died before
the play began, and sent his ghost to make
trouble for his son, widow and brother. Old
man Polonious, with Ms son Laertes and
his daughter, Miss Ophelia Polonious, get
drawn into the trouble and Hamlet kills the
eaves-dropping Polonious. Afterwards he
stabs his uncle with a poisoned rapier and
forces him to swallow the dregs of the cup
of poison which his mother has just drunk
from. Meanwhile Hamlet and Polonious,
jun., have wounded one another fatally, and

pond, has been buried by* two comic grave-
diggers who didn’t even stop to throw earth
on the body*. This brutal neglect on the part
of the gravediggers indicates that there was
indeed something very rotten in the State of
Denmark.
* * * *
It is a virile show, comparing not
unfavorably with more expensive re-
vivals except as regards supers and splen-
dor at the Danish Court. The producer
takes care that this paucity of spectacular
trimmings shall not matter. For instance,
the policy of confining Ophelia’s scene to
an audience of three horrified principals
only, instead of, as of old, a semi-circle of
onlookers who were mostly not horrified at
all, is a highly commendable policy. All
the latest, bright ideas have been in-
troduced into the Irvingesque stage busi-
ness, and the action is vivid throughout.
Wilkie in the name part confirms the best of
one’s previous impressions of him as an
earnest un-stagey actor. He is again very
variable in quality*, and his delivery* of cer-
tain speeches is apt to lapse into recitation.
But his casual remarks have the force of
impromptus. lie has a tender feeling for
the character and he has moments
of magnetic passion, especially at the
end of the Play* Scene and when
he makes his uncle swallow some of
his own dope. If he is weakest in the stormy
interview with his mother it is because Miss
Sydney* makes the Queen a hard, emotionless
sort of woman. She and her second husband
(Cosgrove) offer no reasonable explanation
of why that stout Number 2 poured poison
in his predecessor’s ear. Walter Hunts acts
Laertes admirably, except for a fervid mono-
tony in his elocution. Polonious (Marcus
St. John) is a convincing feeble identitv,
delivering the wise injunctions to his
in a jaunty platitudinal tone which is hT
only tone possibly consistent with the eon
eral senility of the shallow old tactician
Faulkner, as the colorless Horatio, and Fit-
herbert, as a sonorous but thick-tonenM
ghost, are satisfactory. On the other hand
THE RETURN AFTER THE
INTERVAL.
The six o'clock closing of hotels in Syd-
ney is responsible for expressions like these
among some theatre-goers. Thirsty souls
are doing their best nightly to forget the
interval habit.
Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are a crude
pair of courtiers not nearly as well spoken
as the two casual soldiers on the ramparts.
And Osric is neither youthful nor graceful.
Miss Harvey does the little part of the
Player queen very nicely, and Miss Hunter
Watts, as a brunette Ophelia, is charming
in her sanity and impressive in her madness.
No Ophelia could be more gently or pathetic-
ally realistic.
* * * *
Apart from other things, “The Waybacks,”
at Melbourne King’s, is disagreeably remind-
ful of “On Our Selection” in its thin, but
lurid flavoring of bellowdrama. Just as the
Steele Rudd play found room for a working
viP in, so the present outbreak includes a
young rotter who endeavors to provide re-
lief from the roars of the Waybacks by
frightening his dear old uncle to death. But
beyond the puerile wickedness of nightly
patrolling uncle’s residence in a suit of
phosphorus, the young man isn’t especially
offensive. He embezzles not, neither does he
insult with base proposals the lonely school-
marm whom a syrupy bush Adonis is fated
to wed. All the characters are dramatically
negligible. The only one with any claims
to vitality is Dad, and he merely reflects the
crude and primitive nature of Dad Rudd.
All Rudd’s fondness for sudden violence and
whiskers is carefully repeated in old-man
Waybaek. As for the Wayback family, they
are at least original in being too numerous
to mention.
Of the cast, William Stewart as Dad
follows the histrionic trail which comedian
Bert Bailey played before him. He is an
ancient with a large heart, an ingratiating
energy, and a bellow equal to all emergen-
cies. Miss Gladys Lee as Ma is stricken
with lethargy, while Miss Blair and Miss
Rooney, daughters Tilly and Euphemia. are
not unusual enough to leave even an abiding
impression of caricature. Cleave McGrath
gives emphasis to the loutish imbecility of
Jabez, but a perpetually gaping mouth is
the beginning, middle and full-stop of Leslie
Mansfield’s representation of Rube. Frank
Hatherly as the bad boy is doubtfully accept-
able, and Herbert Stallard is warned against
uttering the hero's sentiments in a high-
pitched voice that with half a note rise would
become a whistle.
Rather suddenly the panto at Melbourne
Her Majesty’s has announced its intention
of quitting the premises. It will run up to
the last day of the month only, so anyone
desirous of seeing it again had better tie a
piece of cotton round his nose as a reminder.

The Follies at the Tivoli (Melbourne)
continue to be “supplemented by the Belgian
Concert Party,” as the advt. puts it. From
an impartially artistic point of view the
Follies are subjecting the Concert Party to
interruptions, and there are times when one
wishes they wouldn’t. The three instru-
mentalists are a musical apology for all the
ragtime items in the entertainment, and
when baritone Goossens warbles “O Solo

apology seems more than ample.

This week Ashmead Bartlett is dealing
more comprehensively with the Dardanelles
subject at the Auditorium. Everybody knows
that Bartlett knows his subject, and
he needs no further assurance of the
public’s desire to make him warm up to it.
All the applause necessary to urge a lecturer
on his long, lonely way is always in readi-
ness to burst forth.

landing on lumps of timber. Bluffo, a comic
juggler, is a somewhat fatiguing personage
in another part of the bill; while it may be
said of tlie juggling Testros that if they do
not weary they fail to exhilarate. A new
character comedienne named Betty Bruce is
a change in the bright direction. One of her
songs, wherein a curate plays a promising
part, would jnake a joy item for a smoke-
night.
A film version of “The Man Who Stayed
at Home,” followed by a striking Zeppelin
item, gave a warlike complexion to Hoyt’s
Melbourne programmes on Saturday. This
week the house is screening the Australian
production of Nurse Cavell’s murder, with
Vera Pearce sweetly suffering Hun ven-
geance in the name-part.
The most striking thing in sight in Adel-
aide shows is the Nurse Cavell film-story at
West’s; with Vera Pearce and Harrington
Reynolds in the star parts. It is a fine
example of the value of the new method of
teaching history as you may wish it taught.
It is unlikely, for example, that even a Hun
court-martial had a horrid grin on its face
when pronouncing sentence of death ; and it
is certain that the. victim did not, as depicted,
proudly wave aside the proffered eye-bandage
and stand boldly up to face the volley. Won-
dergraph is showing Tittell Brune’s “Golden
West” girl with the aces in her stocking,
and one or other of the houses has unreeled
the late Lewis Waller (who happened never
to visit the city) and Gaby Deslys (who is
not likely to). At the King’s Paul Stanhope
and co. take up half the programme with a
revue, “This Is the Life.” At the Royal
Anderson’s Co. is doing good business, slid-
ing rapidly from the breezy “Sailor’s Wed-
ding” to the preachy “Girl’s Cross Roads.”
“Jwosp”: Genevieve Ward, who has gone
back to the stage for George Alexander in
"The Basker” at the age of 67, was origin-
ally in grand opera, and had established her-
self in Italy, Britain and America, when
diphtheria knocked her singing voice out of
gear. Eleven years of teaching in New
rork and then she bloomed at the Theatre
Loyal, Manchester, as a powerful Lady Mac-
beth. There are two biographies of her:
one deals with the career of Genevieve
'»ard, the other is “A Memoir of Ginevra
Luerrabella.”
From a cold corner in N’York :
There are 950 retail flicker palaces in this city,
and in a recent month over 5000 players were
Represented on the screens. More than 2000 flickors
and flickoresses own motor-cars and dwell in Easy-
stieet, and how long it is going to last isn’t
worrying them. Flick has given the legitimate
idage a staggering blow in the meantime, and while
picture humpies are springing up wherever hope of
a dividend leaps in the human breast, real theatres
are finding it more and more difficult to drag anyone
inside.
AT POVERTY POINT.
“Avon”: Hamlet glooming on the Mel-
bourne stage again, in the person of Allan
Wilkie, sets my memory machine working.
The workmanlike Sullivan was the best up
to his date, with a performance about
equally welcome in London, Sydney and
Melbourne. Brooke was too heavy for Ham-
let, and seldom acted it. But he had the
matchless voice and profusion of statuesque
attitudes. Charles Kean’s Hamlet would
be only a sort of photograph when he
reached Australia, though he had been bet-
ter in the part than his renowned father.
Montgomery was a Melbourne craze. He
had not been so in London, nor did he be-
come so in Sydney. Titheradge, a far better
actor, was something like him. Montgomery
introduced here the blonde Fechter wig—
apparently the right thing. Creswick’s Ham-
let was astonishingly good, considering his
great age. Adams was the ideal of many.
And honorable mention in varying degrees
to Fairclough, llowe, 11. B. Irving, and the
always intelligent but nasal Dampier, who
overcame many disqualifications by force of
mind.
“Jean S.-” : For the purpose of educating
young and uninformed soldiers anent the
dangers of syphilis Gregan McMahon is
arranging to present Brieux’s “Damaged
Goods” at one of the military camps at an
early date. There is a notable moral in
Brieux’s plain, unvarnished tale of the nice
young man who would not take the doctor’s
advice, and with McMahon as the medico
and poet McCrae as his appalling patient
the “lesson” should soak in with dramatic
emphasis.
“Arradni”: Now that we are about to
get another J.C.W. war production, let’s
hope more attention will be paid to detail
than in “The Man Who Stayed at Home.”
TI wireless nart of “The Man Who Stayed”

beginner, who is fingering a key for the first
time. Then, again, a wireless equipment,
capable of talking to German coast stations
and ships at sea, couldn’t be worked by
a couple of accumulators. A power of at
least two kilowatts would be required, and
such an apparatus couldn’t be enclosed in a
wooden fireplace without consuming the
whole show. Finally the key used was a
toy affair which would melt in actual w r ork.
When so much advt. is being made out of
the “production,” it seems a fair thing that
the “production” shouldn’t be a howling
farce.
Australian Rupert Julian is now a pro-
ducer of films in the U.S.A. One of his
latest jobs was the transposing of Eugene
Field’s “Little Boy Blue” into a drama,
with Julian’s wife, Elsie Jane Wilson, in
the lead.
“E.T.”: When Barrie’s “What Every
Woman Knows” had been running a week
or two, it struck George Musgrove that cer-
tain passages of dialogue between two of
the middle-aged characters were not
thoroughly understood by the audience. The
male character in question when a young
man had met the lady in Constantinople,
and had almost, but not quite, proposed
marriage to her in those days. lie recalls
the tender memories when they meet again,
after many years, in the second act. “Ah,
those glorious nights on the Bosphorus!”
he exclaims reminiscently. One evening
before the curtain rose Musgrove suggested

MAJESTY'S, MELBOURNE.

that the locale should be altered so that it
might more easily be grasped by those in
front. The actor begged to differ; he
thought everybody knew where the Bos-
phorus was and didn’t like to interfere with
Barrie. “G.M.” was not to be baulked.
Calling a scene-shifter he interrogated him.
“Bill, d’ye know what the Bosphorus is?”
“No, Mr. Musgrove,” said Bill. “Well, d’ye
know what the Mediterranean is?” “Yes,
it’s a sea, ain’t it?” “Correct,” said “G.M.”
Then turning triumphantly to the mummer:
“There you are, my boy; better make it
‘Mediterranean.’ ” A.nd “Mediterranean” it
was henceforth.
“Harrison O.”: That Poverty Point yarn
(B. 10/2/T6) of the naughty girl who found
the peace that passeth all misunderstanding
after witnessing the miracle in “A Village
Priest” may be a mendacity, but it contains
the germ of a great truth. If there is one
person above all others likely to be im-
pressed by a stagey trick of the sort it is the
common or Collins-street variety of Juliet.
For a year or so, as a City court reporter,
I formed platonic friendships with a num-
ber of ladies of ridiculously easy virtue,
who used to attend to receive the usual
“fiver” or a month, and often talked with
them about dramatic art; for Flossie
delights to visit the theatre. To a
couple of likely females I loaned
copies of Ibsen and Strindberg; but
my well-meant efforts to spread culture
among the demi-monde of Melbourne met
with scant success. With a few variations
all of my friends favored the same plays—
“ Camille,” “Everywoman,” “The Second
Mrs. Tanqueray,” “The Sign of the Cross,”
“A Village Priest,” “Parsifal” and “The
Christian.” Apparently these nymphs like
best a play which idealises a mem-
ber of their own class, or else is varnished
with a pale cast of sanctity. But Flo
insists on lily-white morality in her heroes.
There is an interesting psychological study
in this sharing of affection between John
Storm and Camille, Parsifal and Paula
Tanqueray. It is certainly strange that
Flossie, despite the cynicism which she in-
evitably acquires, nearly always has tears
to shed when a dramatist holds the mirror
upside down to her own nature or provides
the comfort of religion without the discom-
fort of a pew.
“C. Ockney”: Rider Haggard, novelist
and farming expert, who is re-visiting
Australia, once aspired to be a
dramatist. Several stage versions of his
“best sellers” have seen the footlights. “She”
was perhaps the most favorably received.
It was adapted for the boards by Clotilde
Graves (better known as “Richard Dehan”
nowadays), and was produced at the old
Gaiety in the Strand. Haggard was in a
private box, and when the curtain fell and
the usual cries of “Author” were raised, he
advanced to the front and bowed. Someone
in the audience yelled “Speech,” and the
biushing novelist (he was young then)
obliged. “La dies and gentlemen,” he said,
“1 thank you for the kind way in which you
have received the play. I won’t go so far
as to say that it is a great play, but I think
you will agree with me that it has great
possibilities.”
“Stargazer”: The influx of American
mummers is having one very marked evil
influence on the Australian stage, it has
served to afflict scores of bright young pros
of both sexes, born and bred in Australia,
with the loathly accents of the cute fellows
from Nevada, lowa, Oklahoma, New York
and thereaway. Apparently it is accepted
as absolutely essential that when a per-
former in Melbourne or Sydney has some-
thing smart to say he must say it out
of the hollows of his neck, via the nose, with
the fetching Yankee timbre that is so popu-
lar. This is an abominable affectation. It
is high time Australia began to fasten on to
her own national peculiarities, good, bad
and indifferent, and if there’s popular fun
to be got out of awful talk let us make it a
local industry.
An “Author’s Theatre” is the latest idea
under discussion in London theatrical
circles. A place where new plays can be
tried and tested for the benefit of the aspir-
ing voung dramatists, and where theatrical
managers can rjrop in and sample the goods
thus submitted,* is declared to be a “loug-
felt want.” Sounds very plausible in theory,
but who is going to fork out the rent, and
pay for the electric light, not to mention
wages of players and staff? If managers
have neither the will nor the time to read
the numerous plays sent to them by un-
known dramatists, they are not likely to
spend their afternoons sampling experi-
mental performances at the Author’s. Marie
Lohr is one of the leading actresses who
have expressed cordial approval of the pro-
ject. Marie says she is “intensely inter-
ested” in the idea, and it seems to her to
“present some fascinating possibilities.” It
will save her the reading of so many plays.
Dick Boucicault, partner with Robert
Brough in a well-remembered high-class
Australian theatrical enterprise, was about
to start management on his own at the New
Theatre, London, on Boxing Day, when last
mail was leaving. lie was to begin with
a revival of “Peter Pan.” which he pro-
duced for several successive Christmas sea-
sons in an adjacent theatre as chief lieu-
tenant of the late Charles Frolimann, mur-
dered by Huns in the Lusitania. After
Peter Pan Dick will present his wife, Irene
Vanbrugh, in a new play specially written
for her by Somerset Maughan. He is also
to have a character in it himself. Irene
has for a long time been wishful to play a
couple of Shakspearian roles, Portia and
Beatrice, and Richard hopes to be able to
gratify her desires in that respect.
The Duke of York’s, London, a theatre
that surely ought to be renamed in a more
sensible fashion, was the headquarters of
the late Charles Frohmann, and it has now
been taken over by Miss Horniman, who
has acquired the remainder of Frohmann’s
lease. Miss Horniman has made a big suc-
cess during recent years as manager of a
repertory theatre at Manchester. It was
she who discovered Stanley Houghton and
n rod need most of his plays long before the
world woke up to their merits. Miss
Hornimau says she reads on the average
40 plays a week, and she reckons that
she has waded through a total of 10,000
in her time. Her verdict is that not two
per cent, were worth a second thought. In
starting her new London enterprise she
lias isssued a proclamation that she. has
“no use for a war play, being convinced
that theatre-goers have at present no relish
for that sort of thing.”
“Private Boxer”: It’s always a puzzle to
me where the picture-show spruikers come
from. Are they, like poets, “born, not
made” ; or do they, like Topsy, “just grow” ?
Some I have listened to can talk like M’s.l*,
at a picnic; others like imported mummers
speaking their well-thought-out impromptus
before the curtain on first nights. All are
worth hearing. They know their job and
are as “continuous” as the shows they ad-
vertise. Many a trained mummer might
well marvel at and envy their quick
“study.” Also their quick wit, for their
replies to interruptions and interrogations
from the crowd at times will take a lot of
beating, even by mimes who patter ever so
eloquently behind the footlights. Give me
the good spruiker in preference to the
mediocre mummer. Whence comes the
spruiker and his tKibe?
Oswald Stoll aspires to be the Napoleon
of British variety. From his headquarters
at London Coliseum he directs a score of
palatial music-halls, and he has just made
a notable addition to the list by acquiring
the Alhambra. His only rival, Alfred Butt,
who runs the Palace and the Empire, was
also after the Alhambra, and thought he
had secured it when at the eleventh hour
Stoll chipped in with a better and more
attractive offer. The Alhambra is one of
the oldest and largest of the London variety
houses, and for a long time it specialised in
gorgeous ballet productions with plenty of
pretty girls, magnificent dresses and expen-
sive staging. But that form of entertain-
ment has now gone completely out of
fashion, and, in consequence, the Alhambra
has not been a paying property of late.
Stoll is going to reconstruct the Vast ram-
shackle structure and run it on the lines
lie has so successfully adopted at the Col-
iseum close by. He will be the second Mel-
bourne man to take the Alhambra in hand.
Alfred Moul, once musical critic of Mel-
bourne Age, was its managing director for
some years.
“Dumper”: The Australian film manu-
facturer has other troubles besides the
absurdly low tariff. He is bound by certain
censor regulations that are never applied
to the imported article. For instance, no
local picture must make fun of the police, yet
nine-tenths of the imported comic films are
police skits. Then in the dramatic sphere
we are never allowed to depict the villainous
Tammany policeman, though that person is
largely responsible for the success of many
imported photoplays. Again, local bush-
ranging pictures are absolutely forbidden;
yet nothing is said against an imported film
like “Stingaree,” the scenes of which are
laid in Australia, the hero being a bush-
ranger and glorified martyr, who in the very
first series sticks up and robs a mail coach.
I: is another bad instance of Australia's
pernicious habit of handing the foreigner the
oyster and hitting our own people in the
eye with the shell.
“Moana”: There seems to be something
approaching an exchange of mummers going
on between Australia and Wilson’s country.
The number of players with a twang now
getting a hearing on this continent is easily
balanced by the army of Australians across
the Pacific. Here are a few of them and
their present jobs : Ivy Scott, well known in
musical comedy with Williamson’s, is now
wife to a big theatrical manager, and is
going on tour as Maid Marion in the comic
opera, “Robin Ilood.” Charles Coleman is
playing in a sex drama, “The Natural
Law.” Dion Titheradge goes into a new pro-
duction by William Brady. Leonard Willey
is appearing in a dramatic version of Steven-
son’s “Treasure Island.” Claude Flemming,
years ago here with Nellie Stewart, is the
baritone lead in a musical show, “Two’s
Company.” Elsie Mackay, Fan Dango’s
stepdaughter, is to appear with Cyril Maude
in “Grumpy”; and Leila Carmichael, once
decorating the Williamson chorus, has mar-
ried one of the Lubin Co.’s directors, and is
helping to make flicker film for hubby.
“Jwosp” : Tom Graves, the little comedian
with a tricky memory, who was with “The
Gay Gordons” five or six years ago, died in
his greasepaint at Chicago on December 22.
lie was playing the leading comedy role in
“Nobody Home,” and just before the close
of the piece dropped dead in the wings. He
was a brother of George Graves, whose style
he largely followed. When Gay Gordoning
here he often got the verses of his songs
mixed and had to gag until he could take
mental soundings.

PENEOLD'S
WINES
That outbreak of last week was not the
first of its kind in Sydney. The 99th Regi-
ment, Colonel Henry Despard, was the
last of the British troops to occupy the
old barracks in George-street. Despard, a
martinet, was known as “Keep off the
grass.” He had a family cow, and the lawn
in Barrack-square was preserved for the
animal’s use. Late in 1845 the Colonel dis-
continued the grog ration. Not only’ did the
men lose the liquor, but they discovered
that the money allowance in lieu thereof
was just one-half what it should be. There
was a wet canteen in the barracks, run by
Thomas Kellett, who also kept the Crispin
Arms, in Clarence-street, and later on built
the Sir Joseph Banks Hotel at Botany. The
99th men refused duty, and General Sir
Maurice O’Connell —whose wife, daughter of
Governor Bligh, had witnessed another
mutiny—sent to Van Diemen’s Land for the
Xlth regiment, Colonel Bloomfield, to hurry
over and quell the disturbance. The regi-
ment landed where Circular Quay now is
and marched up George-street with fixed
bayonets to the parade ground, where they
were received with loud cheers by the 99th,
who were confined to barracks. But no
blood was shed. Bloomfield, a different type
of man to Despard, understood the soldier,
and soon had the irritated regiment under
control. The men got their grog money in
full and the mutiny fizzled into history.

“Melb”: Military-surgeon Crossley, from
Egypt, lectured here this week on the Great
Pyramid, of interest to many thousands of
Australian soldiers, besides tourists. The
other Pyramids are empty imitations of the
great one. Piazzi Smyth gives its age as
4087 years. The American International
Bible Students’ Association, largely repre-
sented in Australasia, in a book on the Pyra-
mid claiming a million readers, produces an
idea that it was constructed under the
guidance of Melchizedek. It is said
to-be a Bible, with endless significance.
Therefore, the orthodox hold that it is from
Divine inspiration, infinitely beyond the wis-
dom of the Egyptians.
HOW WOMEN LOVE ONE ANOTHER.
HOSTESS: “That’s my daughter’s latest photograph. They say she’s inherited the
family’s good looks.”
FRIEND (grudgingly): “Um! Well, your late husband teas certainly a good-looking man.”
“General Sorrowful” writes :
Marching in fours one of the columns passed
down the city street bronzed and hard-looking ; also
half-full of beer. Men rushed from shops and offices
and waved the gallant lads good-bye. Girls leaned
from upstairs windows, passing down glad-looks and
scraps of ribbon. After a while the column didn’t
march in fours, and the waving and the glad-looks
were cut off. The men slouched along any old
way. Some of them were cheerfully kicking a kero-
sene-tin backwards and forwards across the road.
Some were ringing a bell. Most were climb-
ing into passing tramcars and telling the guards to
settle up with Kitchener. A Chow drifted into the
firing-line loaded with a couple of baskets full of
lettuce and spring onions. The vegetables dis-
appeared into space inside lOsee. A cart stacked
with lemonade and cordials happened along. It lost
its freight in one lift. A cake shop was stripped
as bare as an imported tree in winter. Then the
column surged on avd acquired beer and cigars at
the corner, and gradually broke up into roving
bands. At the pub some of the joyous spirits jambed
hard to the bar, and after consuming most of the
contents raged for the Johns to come on. The Johns
accepted the invitation, and unlimbering their batons
made the conflict as willing as the alcoholic cir-
cumstances allowed. For five minutes the air was
full of smash, crash and skin, and then the chal-
lengers broke and fled to re-form further on and
smash some more unarmed windows. “Look out!”
bellowed someone, and the ring of horses hoofs sug-
gested that it was time to retreat. The stampeders
made a wild rush for safety as the troopers rode
into the hail of blue metal. Thenceforward there
were wild alarms and scattering to and fro. In the
circus were teams of agitated figures in khaki pur-
sued by hard-faced, purposeful individuals with
lumps of timber. “Get it on to ’em,” screamed
someone as a fire-hose was brought to play upon a
picket. “Firel” said someone else. The inflamed
rabble poured away leaving a corpse and about a
dozen stricken bodies and Australian blood dripped
into Australian soil. A file of soldiers with bayonets
moved quickly across a street. Bedraggled men,
exhausted with shouting and fighting, boarded the
midnight trains and crawled away back to camp.
They had worked harder during that day and night
of sickening guzzling and scrapping than if they had
drilled from daylight to dark without a spell or a
feed. Many of those who were left behind were in
hospitals or prison cells.
* * * *
“Hamer”: A curious concern, started in
London by a clergyman, and known as “The
League for the Marrying of Broken Heroes,”
vanished like a scalded cat when the origi-
nator’s bishop threw his gaiters at it. But
it endured long enough to show that the
man who returns from the war, leaving a
portion of himself behind, need not be lonely
in his helplessness. The League’s object
was, frankly, to secure for incapacitated sol-
diers wives of a strong, energetic type who
were willing to support the family. Hus-
bands will be a scarce commodity when the
war is over; and the League’s advertise-
ments until it was scared off brought in a
rush of applications from women who were
anxious to get mates while the early doors
were open. Some day soon a herd of
disappointed women will start out after that
bishop and chase him on to the roof of St.
Paul’s.
South Australia has spent nearly £50,000
on a block of Old Folks’ Homes, to take the
foimer occupants of what was curtly called
the Destitute Asylum. The old place was
cramped in the city, on North Terrace,"
close to Government House, and both Uni-
versity and Public Library would probably
like its ground. The Homes’ site is high,
broad, and breezy from Magill, five miles out
on the first slopes of the hills. The place is
far better suited for its purpose than the
rejected Asylum site, and the new buildings
are supposed to be the very latest and best
design.
A QUESTION OF COLOR.
TYPIST : “Why have you quarrelled with
Billy?”
OFFICE GIRL : “Oh, he ashed me to suggest
a color for his winter suit, and I said
khaki.”
“D.F.”: Two amateur J’s.P. were on the
Bench at Hobart (Tas.) when a pawn-
broker was charged with concealing stole
goods from the police. When the evident
for the prosecution had been given
J’s.P. left the Bench; after a few minutes
retirement they returned and the accused
lawyer began to set forth his case. ‘",
mind that,” said the chairman; “we nat
found the accused guilty.”
AUSTRALIA.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
(God give vs a good conceit of ourselves.)
Australia, my native land,
A stirring whisper in your ear —
’Tis time for you to understand
Your rating now is Al, dear.
You’ve done some rousing things of late,
That lift you from the simple state
In which you chose to vegetate.
The persons so saperi-or,
Whose patronage no more endures,
Now have to fire a salvo for
The glory that is fairly yours.
At length you need no sort of crutch,
You stand alone, you’re voted “much ’—
Get busy and behave as such.
No man from Oskosh, or from Hull,
Or any other chosen place
Can chance in with distended skull,
And cast aspersions in your face.
You’ve given all the world to know
Your proper standing as a foe,
And hats are off, and rightly so.
You’ve furnished heroes for the fray,
Your sterling merit’s widely blown
To all men’s satisfaction; say,
Now have you proved it to your own ?
Now t have you strength to stand and shim
In your own light and say, “Divine
The thing is that I do. It’s mine ! ”
The cannon’s stroke throws customs down
The black and bottomless abyss,
And quaking are the gilded crown
And palsied feet of prejudice.
The guns have killed, but it is true
They bring to life things good and new - .
•God grant they have awakened you !
My ears are greedy for the toast
Of confidence before our guest,
The loyal song, the manly boast
Your splendid faith to manifest.
In works of art and livelihood
AS ONE WHO KNEW.
SUNDAY SCHOOL TEACHER : “And now, my dear children, where do all the good girls
go?”
CHOSUS: “To Heaven, teacher.”
TEACHER: “'That’s right. Note, where do the bad girls go?”
SOPHISTICATED PUPIL: “To the soldiers’ camp.”
Shirk not the creed, “What’s ours is good,”
Dread not to have it understood.
Australia, lift your royal brow,
And have the courage of your pride.
Audacity becomes you now.
Be splendidly self-satisfied.
No land from lowliness and dearth
lias won to eminence on earth
That was not conscious of its worth.

“Masarcus”: According to a Yankee call-
ing himself Captain James Brown there is
an island off the western ledge of Australia
upon which £12,000,000 in English sov-
ereigns was buried by pirates or land agents
ia 1850. Brown has got to the ear, or leg,
of sundry influential anu trusting business
men of Kansas City, who have financed an
expedition, which is now at San Francisco
fitting out a ship to bring home the sugar.
Brown says he is the only survivor of the
pirates who buried the treasure, and this is
alleged to be his second attempt to uncover
it (Evidently he was the pirate with the
worst memory.) The backers have been
told to read “Treasure Island” till next
November, when Brown expects the spades
to grate on the lid of the chest or the skull
and cross-bones or something.

“Billy Blue”: N. S. Wales Liquor
Act has been responsible for the closing
lately of one of the oldest pubs in the south-
ern part of the State. This was Mandell-
son’s Hotel at Goulburn. It was not the
first hotel in that part, a drinkery having
been opened in the neighborhood by one Mat
Healy in 1832. The present town of Goul-
bnrn was laid out in ’33, and one Jack Cole,
a sawyer, realising the prospects of the place,
bought a corner section and opened a public-
house thereon. He remained till ’43, when
Joseph Mandellson came along and bought
him out, pulled down the old place and built
the house just closed by local-option vote.
At the time of closing it contained over 50
rooms, and in its time sheltered all sorts
of travellers, including sundowners, Gover-
nors and Judges when on the wal-
laby. It was there that the first
Masonic lodge meeting in the township
was held. In the diggings days at Araluen
and other fields Mandellson’s was the popu-
lar resort. There is a legend that Mandell-
son was once offered £30,000 to get out and
refused.
TO THE POINT.
KNUT : “By Jove, that’s a jolly fine Turk-
ish fez you’ve got there, old chap. What
will you take for it?"
RETURNED BILLJIM : “Oh, it’s not for sale;
but I can give you the address where
you can get one like it."
Paris Nesbit, of Adelaide, in a moment
of characteristic excitement, laid an infor-
mation for “fraudulent conversion” of £l4
against his own sou and partner. It is
safe to say that nobody ever supposed that
there was anything in such a charge against
the highly-esteemed Nesbit junior; and
when the case came on his lawyer read a
letter from the senior admitting that the
charge was made “with undue haste and
without full consideration,” and expressing
“sincere regret.” Counsel added hand-
somely that “only a man who was truly
great could make such a frank and generous
admission of error.”
“E.T.”: Bernard Shaw was asked by
London Tit-Bits for a Christmas message
to send to the boys at the Front. This was
G.B.S.’s reply: “I don’t think it fair for a
comfortable, elderly gentleman in an arm-
chair by the fire to send patronising mes-
sages to soldiers on active service in the
middle of winter. They can’t shoot back.”
HIS STRONG POINT.
WAITER: “Yes, sah?"
CUSTOMER: “ Steaka de oysla!"
WAITER: “You speaka like that, me no
understand; you wanta steaka de oyst,
you speaka de Ingl ”
One Darcy Broughall had his ardor for
collecting wives discouraged at Melbourne
last week when Edith Connor sued him for
breaching his promise to marry her. It was
explained that Darcy, after being engaged to
plaintiff for a year, casually informed her
that he had lately met the wife he divorced
years previously, and that she urgently
desired to marry him some more. Also he
thought the ex-wife had a sort of first call
on him, and he trusted Miss C. would realise
the reasonableness of the argument. She
didn’t. She went after him for £249 dam-
ages. When the jury learned that Darcy
had not only defrauded Miss Connor but
also his ex-wife, and had married a third
lady, it said something firm about £l7O dam-
ages and costs. Some men have very expen-
sive hobbies.

“Billy Blue” : The last of the great Berry
Estate at Coolaugatta, in Shoalhaven, has
been subdivided and sold. Originally the
estate consisted of a free grant of 14,000
acres to Alexander Berry and Edward Woll-
stonecraft, brotliers-in-law and merchants in
Sydney, in May, 1822, the only condition
being that they were to keep and work 100
convicts on the estate. At that time each
convict was costing the Government £l6
a year to feed and guard. Berry and his
partner gradually increased the acreage by
purchase till the whole estate consisted of
80 square miles of country. The convict
servants at Berry were treated well, and
when their sentences expired were encouraged
to settle down with a supply of axes and
pay the rent in felled trees. At one time
Berry had as many as 368 tenants clearing
the iand and their characters at the same
time.

The allowance given to soldiers’ wives in
England is promoting a new industry, which
has grown to substantial dimensions. Many
married and other soldiers, oppressed by the
monotony of the same old missus, marry
another woman on the eve of departure for
the Front. The consequence is that the War
Office is later besieged by a rightful wife and
a “creature” who thinks she holds the first
mortgage. Then the harassed W.O. has to
shove the Kaiser problem to one side while
it sorts the ladies out. Some enterprising
warriors will find something worse than war
awaiting them in England —unless _ poly-
gamy is made compulsory during their ab-
sence. Failing that their refuge is the list
of missing.
“T.F.M.”: In alluding to the many ship-
wrecks on King Island, “Briner” (B.
10/2/TO) seems to have lost his own bear-
ings. The records show that the Neva
(credited with 500 women convicts by
“Briner”) had 340 individuals on board all
told, viz., 150 female prisoners with 33
children, nine free women with 22 children,
and 26 of a crew. Though all hands were
not lost as stated, it
was a sufficiently
wholesale drowning,
only eight of the crew,
the skipper and 15 of
the women managing
to reach the shore
alive.. These women
were all in a more or
less nude condition
(the ship ran ashore
in the middle of the
night), and seven of
their number perished
before morning. The
survivors, being mor-
tally afraid to venture
inland on account of
the ferocious aborigi-
nals they believed they
would meet, managed
to keep alive for three
weeks with shellfish
gathered on the beach,
when they were dis-
covered by the leading
resident of the soli-
tude, a sealer named
Scott, who was accom-
panied by the inmates
of his harem, three
black gins and seven
piebald children. Scott
and his team did their
best for the ship-
wrecked wretches for
a month, when they
were conveyed to
Launceston by Cap-
tain Charlie Friend, a
whaler who chanced
to visit the locality
of the wreck in his
cutter. And I must
insist? on having the
eight recorded survi-
vors of the British Admiral of 1874. There
were 79 souls lost —quite enough corpses for
aii old-time wreck. I want, if possible, to
bieak “Briner” of the “all-hands-lost” habit.
Brother Chidley sends a cry from Mace-
donia :—•
Reception House,
15th February, 1916.
Editor, Bulletin. Sir, —Will you let the public
know that I have never had a fair hearing? I
don’t mean at the Court, but by the public and by
learned societies. I have repeatedly applied to the
University, Royal Society and B.M.A. to be allowed
to give a lecture, illustrated, and to answer all
questions. These bodies have always refused. I have
also had all halls and lecture-rooms in Sydney closed
against me by the police. Is that fair?
I earnestly beseech the public and the Government
in the interests of truth and humanity to see to it
that I be allowed to address the public before bury-
ing me for life with lunatics. I ask this not so
much in fairness to myself, as in the interests of
science and humanity.
OF THE BRUTE CREATION.
CHEMIST : “The small bottle of embrocation
is for human use. The large size is for
beasts."
FAIR CUSTOMER: “ It's for my husband. I’ll
take the large size.”
“Saint Agent” discusses business :
Is Australia looking for a patron saint ? If so,
St. Mark is an applicant for the billet through some
Melbourne Anglicans who are tendering on his behalf.
His “day” in the Church calendar falls on April 25,
the date of the famous Landing; and he happens to
be out of a job as a national patron since the re-
public of Venice, which formerly employed him in
that capacity, went out of business. Mark, by the
way, is his surname, much as if on<s should
speak of “St. Smith”; his first name is
John. It is urged in his favor that he knows
something about the locality of Anzac, since the
Venetians carried his badge on their banners when
they made their conquests in that region seme cen-
turies ago. Moreover, he is alleged to have founded
the first Christian church ,in Alexandria, from which
port the Australasian troops, set out to battle. But
there is one. thing against him, and it is serious. He
started with Paul and Barnabas, the famous
revivalists of his time, on a missionary tour which
included Salonika, and passed within sight of Anzac ;
but in the first few weeks of the tour, after the party
had carried the Great Tidings to the principal towns
of Cyprus, Mark became alarmed at the prospect of
a rough handling on the way across Asia Minor, and
left the others to go on to Gallipoli and Macedonia
alone. A saint who suffered from that trouble is no
fit patron for the men who fought in Gallipoli, even
if their landing did happen to fall on his “day.”
“Try Fluke”: Maori medicine-man Rua
Canaan, who has bolted for his mountain
retreat in the Urewera bush, either to dodge
arrest or to make a dramatic submission
to the John Hops, is a weird sort of poseur
—a Dowie and Brigham Young and Mad
Mullah rolled into one long-haired brown
brother. Rua is the son of a tierce old,
bloke who was christened Canaan by some-
misguided missionary. The old man was;
killed in a light with the pakeha forces ini
’69 —he was one of Te Kooti’s tattooed!
Danites —but Rua is;
not of the warrior-
stamp ; he is all for the
good things of life. His
thousand-odd worship-
pers keep him in luxury
—plenty of wahine,
plenty of tucker and
plenty of cash to take
his seven wives and 12
hairy apostles down to
the coast townships for
a spree. When Rua
and his wahines and his :
bodyguard go on tour-
Julius Knight isn’t in,
it. I collared Rua once>
in a Maoriland town
and hauled him off to*
a photographer’s; the
curio was too good to
miss. The holy man
took up a saintly pose,
after the official hair-
dresser had combed out
his long, wavy tresses
and arranged them pro-
perly on his coat collar,
and one of the 12
apostles stage-whispered
in the brown tongue,
“Isn’t he just like
Jesus!” I’ll give the
Mullah this much credit,
however; he modestly
assured me that he
wasn’t exactly like Ihu
Karaiti; but he thought!
he resembled John the
Baptist, because John
wore his hair long and went about
making prophetic tangis in the wil-
derness. As for his seven wives—well, says
Rua, what about Solomon, and what about
the fourth chapter of Isaiah, which says
that “On that day seven women shall take
hold of one man”? Rua won’t touch tobacco
or allow any of his acolytes to touch it,
but he has no objection to booze. Kapai te
waipiro.
THE EMPTY PACK.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Here comes my birthday singing up the track
The past year’s days have hewn. Upon his back
The little stranger swings a goodly pack
Of gifts for me—all gay and nothing black.
First, lavender for friendship; and I smile,
Feeling your grey eyes bent on me the while,
joy to my friends; peace to my enemies ;
And for the past year’s hurts—why, here’s heart’s-
ease!
Here glad health smiles, and many a tripping rhyme
To suit the measure of the mood and time.
Your count is ended? Oh, a moment, hold—
Is not his love tucked in a hidden fold?
N.S.W.
NORA McAULIFFE.
THE REASON.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
And why did staid men turn and look
At her with shining eyes ?
Was she some beauty from a book ?
Some woman ultra-wise ?
Was she a gifted authoress
Whose books were widely read ?
Will someone dare to chance a guess
Why each man turned his head?
Was she some mighty queen of song
Whose notes were liquid gold:
The queen for whom we’d waited long—
And were we now consoled ?
Was she a painter genius-thrilled
Whose pictures made the earth
Look commonplace—an artist skilled
Beyond all money’s-worth?
Was she some champion of the Right
Whose words were blazing gems ?
Whose speeches glistened, day and night,
Like priceless diadems?
Was she another Helen come
From out a modern Troy,
That men were almost stricken dumb
With unexampled joy?
Was she a modern Joan of Arc
Come back to tell her tale ?
Or else a suffragette of mark?
A Florence Nightingale?
No ; none of these —but something more:
A lady, eyes-begirt,
Whose limbs were shapely, and who wore
A most transparent skirt!

ably to the Town Hall ban-
quet.
“The Bulletin’s” Melbourne artist
visited Sydney incognito last week.
Several publicans kindly placed their
pubs at the disposal of the company.
At length the artist felt the time was
ripe for his oration in reply, but at the
very moment of his “thirdly,” opposi-
tion appeared on the offing. (We men-
tion no names, but have reason to
believe the trouble was due to the
underhand work of certain opposition
artists.)
As the guest of the city the artist felt
it his duty to lead his supporters to vic-
tory.
But the enemy proved too strong.
And he was forced to retreat, aban-
doning much booty.

CHANTER,
M.H.R.
Judge Boucaut daily travelled to and fro
from Glenelg to Adelaide in a second-class
railway carriage. He affirmed, with sar-
donic truth, that second-class was just as
uncomfortable as first-class.
Matt Baird, who obliged now-Senator
McKissock by beating him for the Ballarat
West seat in the Vic. Assembly, went to the
Front last year as a captain in the A.I.F.
Now, as Major Baird, he is coming back to
Australia from Egypt, invalided after a
long stay in hospital.
Cecil Ilartt, The Bulletin’s corporal-
cartoonist, wounded at Gallipoli, was brack-
eted with Andrew Fisher on the latter’s
recent visit to Ilaresfield hospital, London.
A crayon caricature by Ilartt of Geo. Reid
was pointed out as being a “treasure” of the
institution, and the breathless cablegram
broke the news that Hartt’s black-and-white
work was placing Australian sentiment pro-
minently into London publications. How
Greid and Australian sentiment came to be
bracketed isn't clear. The young artist was
wounded in two places by Abdul; the thigh
wound healed quickly, but the ankle-hurt
has caused prolonged trouble.
THE ADVANCEMENT OF SCIENCE.
HERE PROEFSSOR: “You see, yon old fellows
vos all wrong looging for der elixir of
life; pot vas vanted vos der elixir of
death.”
Exit Francis Edward Bigge, 96. at Tor-
quay. He entered the navy in 1835. left
it in 1839. and joined a brother in N. S.
Wales. The pair moved to Queensland and
squatted near Ipswich. In August, 1842,
Francis was bailed up by bushrangers and
severely wounded. leader of the gang,
“Long Tom,” and another ex-convict named
Wilson, were captured, convicted and exe-
cuted. The story of this execution was
incorporated by Rolf Boldrewood in “Rob-
bery Under Arms.”
“0.K.” tells how Peacock might have had
his neck broken: —-
The shipboard scene in this year’s Williamson
panto, always sets me thinking of Premier Peacock.
Not Peacock in his well-advertised laughing mood,;
but Peacock in a moment of pale terror. Th%
suggestion comes this way. The- scene, which repre-
sents a stateroom of a passenger ship, is practically
a big box that rolls and rolls until it finally makes
complete revolutions, ■whilst the furniture is flung all
over the place. It is worked on the principle of
the “Haunted Swing,’’ a popular side-show of old,
the swing itself being a fixture in a' wooden apart-
ment that revolved around it when the machinery
was started. You sat on the swing and saw the
walls of the room rise and fall, and you got all the
inglorious effects of seasickness. Then you closed
your eyes (if you had been prompted) and knew that
you were perched on a motionless seat. The Mac-
mahons ran the “Swing.” It was the simplest of
illusions, but the mystery was too profound for
Peacock when he dropped in to have a shilling’s-
worth. He and his friends were warned, as all cus-
tomers were, that they must keep their seats or harm
might come to them. Peacock, however, wanted to
discover what difference it could make to an emi-
nent State politician if he stood on the floor instead
of keeping his seat when the room began to move.
So he quietly slipped off the swing and found himself
in trouble. The floor receded from under him ; he
slithered violently to the wall in front, and slith-
ered more violently to the wall behind, before the
astonished Macmalion in charge of the show could
blow his signal for the machinery to be stopped.
Mac stood always on a step at the side, conductor-
like, ready to cut off the proceedings if perchance
one of the swingsters went giddy or fell dead or
apoplectic to the moving floor. When the “Mother
Goose” panto, scene reminds me of Premier
Peacock’s rash adventure, I think of what must have
happened had Mac’s whistle been out of order. Then
would the calm, unconscious operators down below
have kept the room in action for the usual time,
and Peacock would have emerged from the entertain-
ment with a broken neck, and his funeral would
have been long, long ago.
Another yarn about the late Judge Bou-
caut, of South Australia. Two counsel, call
them Sharp and Nipper, were before him
on a summons job in chambers sharp,
whose summons it was, took a highly tecn-
nical objection to an affidavit used by -Nip-
per whereon the latter, by way of satire,
countered with an objection to the summons
itself, on the ground that it was not printed
with a one-quarter blank margin as required
by Ord. LXCCCC., Rule 9876. To counsels
amazement, Boucaut at once sent for a meas-
uring rule, solemnly scaled off the P a P e L
and, finding the objection well founded,
promptly dismissed the summons.
Joseph Hains, dead at Port Adelaide at
69, managed to combine prosperous hotel-
keeping with strong Labor principles. He
was treasurer of the original local Coastal
Seamen’s Union, and also of the old Port
Adelaide Working Men’s Association in its
toddling days, over 40 years back. During
the waterside strike of 1890 he did particu-
larly good work, and also earned a reputa-
tion for generosity which stuck to him to the
end.
“The Oldest Inhabitant” recalls a few
items: —■
The old Victorian Yeomanry Corps is recalled to
memory by the death of James Callender Campbell,
ex-M.L.C., Vic., at the agie of 77 years. James
arrived by the Royal Charter in ’5B, and entered
into partnership with Campbell Brothers, merchants
of Market-street, went to Maoriland in ’6l, and re-
turning three years later purchased the auction-
eering business now carried on as Campbell & Sons.
It is claimed for him that he was the last survivor
but one of the old corps, the survivor being Ran-
dall Carey, chairman of the Sydney Daily Tele-
graph. The V.Y.C. jvas established in 1855. The
men found their own horses and uniform, and were
commanded by Colonel J. Hunter Ross, a solicitor.
After a time a split occurred, and an important
section seceded and registered as the Prince of Wales
Light Horse, with Mathew Ilervey, an M.L.C. and a
(then) wealthy squatter as commanding officer. All
the leading squatters and merchants who could ride
a horse joined, amongst them the late J. S. Butters.
A drill-sergeant was required, and thereon hangs a
tale. Old Melbournites will remember, in the ’so's,
that there stood in Lonsdale-street on the south side,
between William and King streets, a little public
house known as The Red Lion Inn. It stood back
some distance from the pathway, with an old-time
horse-trough—the scooped-out trunk of a big free-
standing in the -space between the inn and the road-
way. The house was much frequented by soldiers,
the military barracks being close handy. Towards
the end of the ’so’s it was kept by an ex-sergeant-
major of the 40th Regiment. He was a very
large man; his wife was a mite.* They lived
very unhappily. McLean, after leaving The Red
Lion, became landlord of The Bull and Mouth in
Bourke-street. In a drunken fury he attacked the
woman with a carving-knife. For this he got two
years’ imprisonment. To secure McLean as drill-
instructor was the ambition of the new regiment,
the Governor was petitioned for his release, and it
was granted on condition that the regiment became
responsible for the man’s good conduct. He behaved
well until the troop was disbanded. McLean
and his wife then went to Maoriland, where their
quarrels were renewed, ending up by his being
hanged for her murder.
"Fax”: The only
place of business
where I ever saw
the late Lawrence
Cohen, the Melb.
Trades Hall and
P.L.C. boss, was
the racecourse. He
was the centre of
a group of profes-
sional Laborites, all
of whom are ,on
such good terms
with Ikey Mo that
no one suspects
them of favoring
the totalisator. To
me it seemed that
Cohen ought to
have been a book-
maker rather than
a shining light of
the Vic. Labor
party; and the
fact that when he
recentlv headed a
deputation to the
Postmaster-General
he arrived with a
cigarette in his

my impression of
him.

THE UNKNOWN PATIENT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
[Henry Lawson was recently an inmate of the
Walker Hospital for Convalescents —“Founded by
the late Thomas Walker, of Yaralla, in the Hope
that Within Its Walls Many Sufferers should be
Restored to Health.” This is by way of a song of
gratitude.]
The moonlight breathes on Walker Home and softens
scrub and hill;
The native trees are strangely stirred, the pines are
very still;
The nurse's lantern flits and flits, and pain and
sorrow :ease,
For all the patients are asleep, and all is Rest and
reace.
Nor class nor creed nor race debars, and even
Wealth is free —
The suffering miser shares alike the Home with
Poverty ;
The felon's past is never known when kindness
“sends him through”—
The stone says “many sufferers”; but it means
“sinners,” too.
Within a corner of the grounds, where patients
seldom go,
Well screened by firs and shrubbery a sandstone ledge
runs low;
And, pencilled by an unknown hand upon the yellow
stone,
Is “God Bless Thomas Walker”—four simple words
alone.
I know not who the writer was, and I may never
know:
It may have been but yesterday, maybe was long
ago.
’Tis near the pathway that divides the women from
the men —
It may have been a tortured Christ or a suffering
Magdalen.
perhaps some shy and shrinking soul, relieved
awhile from care,
Crept out of sight of “sterner stuff” to pay a tribute
there.
Or maybe an Impenitent, and many such there be,
For hard men often drop a tear where none but
God may see.
But, good or bad, or high or low—or were he
anything
(Or even traitor to his creed, and rebel to his
king)—

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The funeral of the late Mrs. Walter Russell Hail
took place yesterday at Melbourne General Cemetery.
The casket was brought to Melbourne by the second
division of the express.— The Age.
In coffin grim, in days of old,
The fussy undertaker
Did bury Midas ’neath the mould
Of God’s own special acre;
But nowadays the prison cell
He lays a wealthy toff in,
For evermore in peace to dwell,
Is not described as “coffin.’’
A coffin plain of ash or oak
(A cheaper wood makes scandal)
Suffices for a common bloke,
A vulgar Goth or Vandal.
lie sleeps, protected from the air,
In lidded box (not basket),
Whereas a multi-millionaire, 4
A human jewel rich and rare,
Is locked within a casket.

This co. has altered its book-keeping methods
three or four times ; therefore it doesn’t fol-
low that a profit of £16,354 to-day is the
same thing as one of the same amount three
or seven or any other number of years ago.
At present the plan is to show only the net
profit “after making provision for deprecia-
tion, etc.” ; and the extent of that provision
isn’t disclosed. This is the handy little
device that shipping cos. have for—-well, for
making their published accounts of less
value than they might be. You know that
something ought to be chipped off profits to
pay for repairs and renewals. But the
management may chip off too little, and thus
make the profits out to be greater than they
actually are ; or they may for one reason or
another want to make the profits look
smaller than they really are, and in that
case they chip off too much. If they weren’t
building or reconstructing vessels, etc., you
might get some idea from the movement of
liquid assets. But sometimes they use up
the money as fast as they put it by. In
this case watch two or three items since the
last watering :—•

Ships, lands, etc.. . 442,465 457,204 459,150
Other assets .. 56,468 37,834 38,868
On those figures ships, .lands, wharves and
waiting-rooms are worth now about £17,000
more than they were 18 months ago; but
the surplus of other assets over liabilities
has shrunk about £16,000; so on that show-
ing the co. has done very little more than
pay its dividend. The point to then look
into is as to whether the co. has stuffed
profits away in property which doesn’t
appear on the sheet. No trace can be found
of any. Take ship property, for instance :
it stands now at £298,548 as against
£291,019 eighteen months ago. So far as
can be traced no considerable additions have
been made to the fleet. One or two of the
steamers have been overhauled, one of the
smaller ferries was reconstructed, and a
punt or two have been added for the Parra-
matta cargo-carrying ; but (setting aside the
increase in value owing to the war) it is very
doubtful indeed whether the co.’s fleet, tak-
ing wear and tear of all the vessels into
account, has increased in value more than
the £7500 which has been charged to capital
account during the year and a half. And that
is another way of saying that during this
period no profits appear to have been stuffed
away. Before capital was so liberally
watered, and when working exes, were much
smaller, no doubt profits were surreptiti-
ously dropped into a stocking; and there is
still a vague idea that the same thing is going
on now. It may be. This paper con-
fesses that it can find no evidence at all of
it.

The published accounts put it differently.
They say that the' capital is £250,000 and
the dividend therefore a trivial 35 p.c. The
apparent discrepancy is bridged over in this
way:—-
1886. —Co. registered; paid capital £46,800, plus
£16,000 in promoters’ shares.
1888. —First stock watering: £41,860 capitalised
(two shares for every three).
1889. —Second stock watering: £17,433 (one in six).
Third stock watering, £15,273 (one in
eight).
1890. —Fourth stock watering, £27,473 (one in five).
1891. —Fifth stock watering, £32,967 (one in five).
1910. Sixth stock watering, £52,194 (one in four).
Bringing the little lots together this is the
result:—
Capital actually subscribed.. £46,800
Promoters’ little lot . . 16,000
Profits capitalised . . . . 187,200
Total alleged capital . . £250,000
Certainly it was a gamble when the line was
laid. Originally Silverton was expected to
supply the bulk of the traffic; and Silverton
has been stone dead these many years. It
couldn’t keep a goat-team going, let alone a
railway. But the extension to Broken Hill
turned out a very different proposition, and
it: lias given the old shareholders their mone'y
back 50 times over.
It' is a good deal like a baker’s business.
Suppose the dough industry isn’t as profit-
able as the association of dough-makers
would like it to be. Up goes the price ;|d.
a loaf. There’s a half-hesitating kick.
Whereupon the highly moral and dreadfully
injured master bakers exclaim: “What! Are
you making all this fuss about a ha’penny a
loaf — a week on the average bread
bill?”- Then it doesn’t seem worth while,
and the threatening protest presently drops
dead. Something like that has happened
dozens of times in connection with this co.
It is the big traffic that does it. There are
nearly three-quarters of a million tons of
minerals to be carried every year; and it is
all through-traffic—there is no dropping of
a dozen of eggs here and the picking up of
a box of butter 10 miles further on. No
doubt the line built in the country where
eggs and butter grow by the wayside will
last longer. This railway will be valueless
when the Broken Hill mines peter out. No-
body can say precisely when that will be.
You can see daylight ahead in some of them
for 12 years, with all the ore below the
bottom level to the good. Yet there is an
end; and there is a much nearer end so far
as the zincy tailings are concerned —the vast
accumulations of tailings which have been
shifted at a great rate during the past seven
or eight years.
So there is going to be a tail to this co.’s
history—if the whole hindquarters are not
bitten off suddenly. That isn’t impossible.
The N.S.W. Government has started the
railway from Condobolin “towards” Broken
Hill; and as the Ministry has given its
friencf the Norton Griffiths syndicate an
undertaking to spend a certain amo.unt per
annum, and as this work is on the Norton
Griffiths schedule, the chances are the un-
profitable job Will be gone right on with.
Broken Hill is about 33 miles from the
border of S. Aus., and the connection with
S.A. rail is supplied by this Silverton Tram-
way Co.’s line. Now a dertain amount of
traffic is bound to go towards Sydney and
Lithgow and Newcastle, for special mineral
freights will be arranged ; and that won’t do
this co. any good. But that isn’t the only
centingency. The line forms part of the
great East and West track which runs from
Port Augusta to Perth ; and the question is
whether the 33 miles between the two State
Government systems will be left in the co.’s
hands. Or whether a competing line will
he built. If the latter isn’t done the
chances are that no action will be taken for
a few years after the State line from Broken
Ilill eastward is completed, as if the co. is
disturbed it must under its Act get 21 times
the average profit for the preceding seven
years. And the Government will probably
wait till the competition has pulled the
profits down a bit.

The sooner the practical S. Australian Gov-
ernment sets an independent accountant of
high standing to tell it what he thinks of
the S. Australian co-operative societies’
manner of bookkeeping and finance the
better. This paper is nearly tired of saying
that, in its opinion, the system is a danger,
and the high moral qualifications of the
directors and managements, as a rule, don’t
atlect the position at all. In this case, as
in that of the old Adelaide Co-operative
Society, shareholders are apparently entitled
to withdraw their capital and interest; and
where that capital and interest are invested
in buildings and plant and stock the rule
is liable to wreck the whole concern. Apart
from that the manner in which the accounts
of this co. are presented must make the
statements quite unintelligible to the aver-
age shareholder. According to the (un-
dated) directors’ report which accompanied
the as at May, 1915, the bal-
ance forward Nvas £274 after various appro-
priations. had been made. < This amount is
swollen in the accounts now presented to
£451, and nobody in the wide world can tell
from the' present accounts where the extra
money came from. Apparently a certain
amount of dividend was not collected (and
apparently also that amount reverted to the
co.), and apparently the amount of the
bonus on trade (5 p.c. on members’ sales of
fruit and 5 p.c. on members’ purchases of
goods) was over-stated in the proposed ‘
Appropriation. The whole thing is untidy
-and unsatisfactory, and no credit at all to
the seven directors who sign it.
This criticism, however, goes only to the
of finance and bookkeeping. The
idea back of the co. is most admir-
able. The shareholders are the fruitgrowers
on the one side and the retailers of jam and
preserved fruits on the other. Tired of
supplying unnecessary middlemen with
profits and unnecessary middlemen’s unneces-
sary agents with wages and salaries, these
two parties combined to form this co., and
its success has been so pronounced' that
every season some extension of premises and
plant bas been called for. Meantime the
utmost economy appears to be exercised in
the management. Thus the directors’ and
auditors fees for the whole 12 months
amounted to only £l3O.

The last three lines show. a pretty serious
slump in profits ; and it will be astonishing
if there isn’t more to come. So far the
recent inflation of property values in Sydney
has been maintained by wholesale borrow-
ing ; partly for military purposes, partly for
the State Labor crowd’s own ends. Every-
body knows, of course, that this borrowing
must stop presently, and instead of the lav-
ish outlay of loans there will be heavy taxa-
tion to meet the interest bill. So the tide
will not only cease to come in ; it will rush
out furiously. In that period the real estate
market is likely to suffer more keenly than
most, and R. and W.’s commission earnings
are likely to wear a much more pallid look.
Still this co. now has the whole of its capital
invested; and if it can’t earn at least 6 p.c.
nowadays there is something very wrong.
The investments ought to bring in 4J or
5 p.c., which wouldn’t leave much for the
business to earn. The real nature of the
bulk of the investments is, however, rather
doubtful.

“AdvtSjices„-on properties” form the doubtful
item. They are a comparatively new entry
and may be all right, and in addition they
may bring in good business presently. But
the growth of this item has robbed the stock
of some of the gilt from the edges. Appar-
ently in recognition of this a contingency
fund is being built up. This is not included
in the reserves in the table, nor does the
£5OO which has been added this half-year to
the previous credit balance of £1728 figure
as profit.

The statements sent out by this co. are
almost valueless, as they are doubtless in-
tended to be. The co., not being under the
Gas Act except in a general way (though
the concern acrpss the street is), is under
no obligation to present accounts in the
form prescribed by that Act; and the same
old stuffing away which went on in other
cos. possibly still goes on here. On the
other hand, an insufficient amount may be
put aside to cover depreciation. There is
no telling what is done. The only things
certain are set out in the next table :

The most conspicuous thing there perhaps
is the fine increase in the revenue; and
there is plenty of room for further move-
ment, since the limit of settlement hasn’t
yet been reached at Manly by a long way.
Though sales have increased so much the
directors say that the dividend was reduced
because “during the first half of the year
there was an appreciable falling-off in con-
sumption,” and that is given as the reason
for reducing the dividend. But if former
accounts meant what they said, the 10 p.c.
shouldn’t have been paid, because of the
wretchedly small margin left to come and go
on. However, from the fact that on one
occasion assets were written up and a bonus
was then distributed, the published figures
as before remarked, are probably not to be
taken seriously. Under a decent companies
law, let alone a comprehensive Gas Act
such documents would be impossible. They
offer far too handy a means of letting the
man inside take the outsider down if he feels
inclined to.

The co.’s revenue for the year was the high-
est yet recorded. Receipts from the business
have moved in this rather surprisin'* wav.
1913, £30,020; 1914, £34,863; 1915 £37 0%
Part of the explanation seems to’ be th-ii
the troopships going and coming hat
brought to the city thousands of mothet
aud sisters and cousins and aunts and
large proportion of them have made this
moderately inexpensive coffee palace the r
haven. Provisions have, however been «
dear that, though profits have been g o od°
they haven’t actually soared. There is no
immediate prospect of a reduction, either
and wages and other costs are no doubt uri
to stay —for a time, at any rate. Still the
general prospects of this and the one or
two similar cos. in Melbourne seem all
right, mainly because of the steady reduo
tion in the number of hotels. The question
is bound to arise presently whether stem
should not be taken to revalue the assets
and make the capital correspond Until
1597 this co.’s capital was £lOO,OOO- now
though the book value of the freehold (witli
furniture and plant) is £73,345, the oanit-«i
is only £26,000, and the net liabilities are
very little more than £20,000. I n the cir
cumstances the 15 p.c. dividend is decen
tive: no co. with a capital of £26,000 and
net liabilities of only £20,000 could hope to
provide anything like the same accommoda-
tion, or make as much profit as this co
shows, or pay a 15 p.c. dividend. A ficti-
tious rate of dividend like this merely
encourages attack of one sort and,another.

Twice a year the directors throw a plate
of bones at the shareholders, accompanied
by the remark that if they call round they
can get the soup ; and the soup is so good,
and the serve has been getting so much
richer and larger, that there isn’t any row
about it. Profits certainly are a bit erratic,
but they tend distinctly upwards, and in
seven years they exceeded the dividends by
nearly £23,000, which is something glitter-
ing on a paid capital of only £25,000.
Further, it lias been true profit; mostly it is
hard cash that has been accumulated. Go
back 10 years:—

The “other assets’’ consist of the co.’s pre-
mises (£15,962),- sundry debtors (£17,210)
and a trifle of furniture; and the sundry
debtors account has, it is hinted, been purged
of all doubtful items. There is every appear-
ance of a steadily increasing business; but
whether it will be possible for the co. to
safely go beyond a 20 p.c. div. is doubtful.
What may cos. from “regulation"
is the argument that their charges anyhow
don’t affect the poor. But though there may
not be any regulation there is bound to be
soon a public trustee in every State, and his
competition will always tend to reduce
cl arges.

T nless there is a substantial contingency
account, consisting of undisclosed profit, the
lay-by for the past year is not nearly
enough; which is another way of saying
that the dividend is excessive and should
not have been paid. And this paper has very
grave doubts whether there is a contingency
fund worth mentioning. Anyway, it can’t
understand a co. with much of a contingency
fund having a few years ago to dip into the
visible reserves in order to write a few hun-
dreds off property; and the disclosure of a
poor little £2OO of internal reserves a year
or so back also suggests a horror of keeping
anything up the sleeve. Yet if there is no
contingency fund a co. ought in these times
to put by a great deal more than £770 in
order to cover advances (“mortgages and
other securities”) totalling £528,871. To
this paper the whole position seems unsatis-

According to a statement by Treasurer
I yons the Tasmanian State Government has
decided to get into the oil business by buy-
ing the shale-oil areas of the Railton-Latrobe
Co about 1488 acres in all, estimated
hi ’contain about 6,000,000 tons of shale
and yield about 250,000,000 gallons of
oil* The Commonwealth has offered to take
5000 tons of fuel oil annually for the navy
for 10 years, though its encouragement to
the Australian industry is confined to offer-
ing a price considerably less than it now has
to” pay for foreign oil. However, the Tas.
Government reckons there will be other cus-
tomers for all the extra oil it can produce,
and at better prices than the Commonwealth
is prepared to give.
The successful treatment of the complex
zinc-lead sulphides of the Ilercules-Rose-
bery group of mines (Tas.) has been solved
once more. This time it has been done by
the Gillies electrolytic process. The trouble
has always been the zinc. When the Her-
cules ore was treated at the Zeehan smelters
the zinc was lost, and the Tas. Metals Ex-
traction Co., which spent about £120,000 in
experiments and in erecting works at Rose-
bery to treat this ore, failed. The claim
for the Gillies process, a unit of which has
been running in Melbourne under the super-
vision of the Federal Government’s expert,
is that it produces practically pure zinc
(99.91 p.c.) and leaves the lead, copper,
silver and gold in the residue in a form in
which they can be easily recovered. The
Hydro-Electric Power and Metallurgical
Co., which has the rights of the Gillies pro-
cess, is pushing ahead with the erection of
works at North-West Bay, near Hobart,
and has a contract with the Tasmanian
Government by which the latter is to supply
power for the co.’s works, giving them up
to 10,000 h.p. at about l-10d. per unit. The
supposed fly in the ointment, if the process
proves on a commercial scale what is claimed
for it, is that tfle Mount Lyell Co. has prac-
tically got hold of the three chief Rosebery
mines, the Hercules, Tasmanian Copper and
Primrose, and it is doubtful whether it will
have anything to do with the Gillies process.
It certainly won’t until Gillies can
demonstrate that his costs are all
right. Nearly 20 years ago the Ger-
man professor Schnabel, imported to make
experiments, told the Broken Hill cos. about
25 ways of recovering all their metals. There
never has been any trouble about the same
thing so far as the West Coast complex ores
are concerned; but commercial results are
quite another matter. And unfortunately
it has been on commercial results that the
delightfully optimistic Gillies has been weak-
est ever since he started in on this zinc
business at B. 11. Block 10.

Whole-hearted efforts have lately been
made in the lvalgoorlie-Boulder mines to
minimise the dust evil. Before long every
working face in the Great Boulder will be
equipped with sprays; Boulder Perseverance
is similarly provided in various parts of the
present workings, and the Kalgurli has also
made great strides in the same direction.
Improvements have been effected at six
levels in the Ivanhoe, and at the South Kal-
gurli dust-laying appliances are in use at
eight levels. The Golden Horseshoe, Lake
View and Star and Associated have also
greatly improved underground conditions.
Attention is now being given to dust in the
mills and surface workings. A number of
remedies have been tested and some have
already given good results.

Getting little else but gibes about being
“a pub- and st*>re-keeper’s push,” the Lease-
holders and Prospectors’ Association (W.A.)
lias given the Labor Government up as hope-
loss, and has induced the Kalgoorlie muni-
cipal council to convene a conference to con-
sider the best means and ways of giving the
mining industry a leg-up. It is proposed
to invite goldfields’ delegates from all parts
of the State and to renew the agitation for
the establishment of mining boards, reorga-
nisation of the State battery system and a
more sympathetic administration of both the
Mines and Water Supply Departments in
the direction of giving greater assistance to
the struggling claim-holder.

“Oof Bird” on tour :
Recently the Edna May Central located a 3ft.
parallel reef 200 ft. distant from the main workings
at the No. 1 level. The reef widened in driving and
turned south towards the greenstone country Those
who were blessed with an Edna May education reck-
oned that an enrichment was likely should the reef
come into contact with that class of rock, and they
made a bulldog rush to square their bear accounts.
So far, it looks as though they were right, as the
new reef is now about 12ft. wide, worth lOdwt., and
looks promising. A crosscut is to be extended south
from the No. 2 level to pick up the continuation of
the shoot, and if it succeeds in doing so the Central
will look better than it has »ever done—
which is not necessarily saying much. The Central
has always been successful in striking new ore bodies
at their richest point, and the rich values subse-
quently reported have always grown painfully less
as time rolled on. Still, in this case, the co. seems
to have located something very promising. It is
good that something worth mentioning has been
located, as the property would have been starving for
the want of ore very soon.
Barrackers of Edna May stock were delighted with
the success of the new electric pumping installa-
tion, but they are intoxicated over the appearance
of the No. 4 level. Here a reef 21ft. in width and
worth 30dwt. has been exposed with no sign of a
footwall. The ore body is looking bigger and better
than at any other level, and those above were far
from being wild-cats. The stone at No. 4 level is
free milling, and gold can easily be seen in the face.
Undoubtedly the development is something out of
the ordinary. However, to those who think the stock
good bearing, a word of advice is given: Inspect, or
consult someone who knows a mine, before operat-
ing. If then unable to shake off the bearish feeling
see a doctor.
Edna May Consolidated recently reported: “Struck
ore carrying values,’’ and shares jumped from Is. 9d.
to 3s. 9d. Those who sold at 3s. 9d. are not worry-
ing, as a report on the following day said: “Ore only
7in. thick.” That is mining!
Edna May Deeps announced the other day that the
last section of shaft cost £25 per foot. Just so;
but will the Deeps truthfully say what it cost to sink
the shaft from 270 ft. to 330 ft. ; and also, in view
of the fact that a treatment plant is being erected,
what ore reserves are in sight? The Maori Lass
holds the record for Yilgarn with Q tons of ore
reserves on completion of a mill. Has the Deeps as
much as that?

Fremantle Trading (Smelting) Co.
(W.A.) has made a start at both its
Northampton lead mines, and expects to
turn out pig-lead next month. The first
year’s estimated output of 5000 tons has
been sold to the Imperial Government, and
for the first time in its history the co. looks
like entering upon a profitable career.
Efforts are being made in Melbourne and
Adelaide to raise money to equip the old
Mount Rankin mine, eight miles south-west
of Southern Cross (W.A.). The show is
faced with the same difficulty as the Broncho
as regards water; but from all accounts it
is worth a trial, though not justifying e±pen-
diture on a mill.
» * * *
After about 18 months of hard work, the
No. 4 level of the Commodore, Meekatharra
(W.A.), disclosed nothing more than a few
veinlets of ore, and these have been of a
quality guaranteed to make a manager’s hair
curl with vexation at a time when jobs aren’t
too plentiful. The co.’s finances have been
handled with a lot of care, so the show has
a cash credit of about £3OOO, besides 17,000
tons of tailings averaging about 16s. per
ton. There must be a few shillings per ton
profit to be made in that quarter.
Most of the Kalgoorlie outputs for
January are considerably reduced as a result
of the recent woodline strike. The Boulder
is down to less than one-half the usual
monthly average, the Associated about the
same, the Kalgurli just a shade better, while
the Perseverance has shrunk to little more
than one-fourth its average.
* * * *
Bodangora, Mitchell’s Creek (N.S.W.),
has declared its first dividend of 6d. per
share. This will be a pleasant surprise to
many of the shareholders, who had assumed
that the co.’s obligations would be fully
met before any distribution was made.
The record is creditable to Victorian
management. Three years ago the mine
was an abandoned derelict. A Sydney
company spent several thousand pounds
on it without being able to show a profit.
The Victorian’s success is all the more satis-
factory because the revenue has been largely
earned out of exploratory work. System-
atic stoping work has hardly been started
yet.
Six months’ milling work shows 2985
tons handled, with £12,130 won from the
rock at a cost of 455. 7d. per ton. At No.
9 level the reef has lately been cut worth
82s. Values grade off at No. 8 away from
the shaft; starting at 765. for the first
400 ft., they ease to 58s. in the next 100 ft.,
and then fall to 295. for 160 ft. As W. J.
Nicliol will draw the bulk of his stone from
this level in the current term, his average
ought to be on the oz. line. He hasn’t a big
reef to play with, so he will have to hustle
on with No. 9to keep ore reserves up. Still
the mine is much better opened than ever
before, and battery work will be on a bigger
scale. The co.’s only debt is £5250 to the
old Sydney owners, payable at the rate of
50 p.c. of the net profits.
Vegetable Creek Tin (N.S.W.) notifies its
shareholders that the debt, originally
£25,000, to the ground-landlord has now been
wiped off. Originally this concern handed
over 30 p.c. of its tin oxide, but that was
subsequently reduced to 25 p.c.; and then an
arrangement was made to pay the vendors
an amount equal to the dividends paid to
shareholders. The 6d. just declared absorbs
£3250, and this year’s distributions must
depend on* the length of the present block-
ing-out campaign. If Vegetable Creek
had gone ahead with development work and
had pushed its leading drives into unexplored
payable areas there would have been con-
tinuous blocking out, but unfortunately that
has not been done.
* * * *
Goobaragandra gold mine, in the mountain
'fastnesses south of Tumut (N.S.W.), has
sent three bulk samples to the Kembla works
for these results: No. 1 reef, 2oz. 16dwt.;
No. 2 reef. soz. 19dwt.; No. 3 reef, 3oz.
15dwt: The co. is prospecting on three
parallel reefs with “satisfactory results”
from all. The battery which is on its way
to the mine is to be ready by May 1, and
then the tale will be told. But can’t the
name be altered? On ’Change it’s already
Gooseandgander. Perhaps the local name
would do. It is Stinking Creek.
Victoria Consols was one of the few Ben-
digonians to earn more than a crust last
half-year. This was achieved by jumping
off dirt at the first sign of impoverishment,
and then giving the tributor a chance to
make wages. The co. requires up-to-date
plant to do better, but it regards such things
as luxuries, even though they would speed
up matters at 512 ft. There is plenty of
stone overhead, but the risk of its being
low grade seems to make the management
hang off rising or driving intermediate levels.
The other string on which the tributor plays
his tune is at 640 ft. Here he digs into a
saddle 10ft. wide and Oft. thick, making
south. But he won’t be the man in posses-
sion long should the reef start to rise, for
that’s when the co. looks for another run of
payable stuff.
* * * *
The Victoria United, Ballarat East, re-
float hangs fire because the average miner
knows the game just as well as any pro-
moter. For years the mine hovered so near
to the border-fine of ldiss that it eventually
became the home of tributors and low-wage
men. To bump up wages meant insolvency
or calls, and the English scrip-holders
weren’t going on with a mine that couldn’t
retuxm interest. The attempt to raise fresh
capital to bump Bull out is reminiscent of
the Long Tunnel experience, which ended in
the group of shareholders who thought they
knew more than the old hands having to part
up solidly for their excursioning. Unless
the Victoria United is to be run as a charity
concern, the best thing to do is to bring it
to the hammer.
* * * *
Great Fitzro.v, the Queensland mine
which has been consistent in a long series of
failures, despite the tons of money which
have been poured into it, the nmst skilled
engineering and the most perfect mechanical
appliances, is likely to have another lease
of life, thanks to the war-inflated value of
copper and to assistance from the Govern-
ment. Debenture-holders had taken posses-
sion of the mine and had seemingly decided
that it was a hopeless proposition, as all the
extensive plant was advertised for sale by
auction. Following the precedent of
Premier Holman in the Great Cobar case,
the Queensland Premier is now negotiating
with the Fitzroy debenture-holders with a
view to making financial arrangements fok
the resumption of operations. When copper
was near the £6O mark it was reported that
the mine was within an ace of being pay-
able. Now that the metal is over £lOO a
handsome profit should be possible. As it is
almost a moral certainty that high values
will continue for a long time the marvel
is that the debenture-holders should have
thought of abandoning the mine or of asking
the Government or anyone else to join them
in sharing the prospective success.

£7200 (Is. 6d. per share). Sinking has now
been resumed on the cross reef, but the pre-
sent bottom is in low-grade stone. The
deepest level (No. 4) has been driven 170 ft,
from the underlay shaft, at which point
there were a few inches of payable stone in
the face. It is hoped that a new shoot will
be developed, but the Moonstone and its
cross reef are notoriously patchy. The
latest return was £1934 from 273 tons of
stone.
* * * *
The New Minnie Moxham, Northcote
(N.Q.), has an overflowing dam and a reef
that promises some good returns. A good
shoot of stone has been developed above No.
1 level, which has been driven 130 ft. A
winze is down 60ft. below No. 1 level, and
driving is now in progress from the bottom.
The battery crushed 136 tons of stone for
2470 z. 7dwt., valued at £989.

Of the 1,181.006 shares in Broken Hill
Proprietary 782,454 are on the London reg-
ister ; Adelaide holds 177,149; Melbourne.
171,374; and Sydney 40,007. Since 1914
London holding has decreased by 44,000, and
Adelaide by 9137, while Melbourne has in-
creased by 55,150. It can hardly be con-
sidered satisfactory that nearly 70 p.c. of
the shares in Australia’s big mine should be
held by outsiders.

A par. (B. 3/2/T6) touching on the his-

impression that the co. won in the litigation
over the ownership of the ground below
Davies and Kershaw’s big claim. The co..
of course, lost the ease, and the payment of
plaintiff’s costs added to its worries.

A WOMAN'S
LRTTER
Sydney, February 21, 1916.
My Dear Arini. —
A son of the late Marquis of Linlithgow
—so popular as G.-G. Hopetoun—who now
reigns in father’s stead, has given the big
house near Edinburgh as a soldiers’ hos-
pital.
The Queen 'of Sweden, whose pic-
ture appeared in recent illustrated papers,
is in appearance very like Mrs. Ivil-
iani. The latter high-browed lady was
a Swede and wife of the Consul-General
for Germany here when his royal master
began to smash up Europe. As you know,
the Queen of Sweden is the German lady
who sent her blessing, by wire, to the
“Fatherland ” when the guns began to
boom.
Colonel Alexander, of the Punjaub regi-
ment, was amongst the injured in the Tas-
manian railway accident. He was taking
a hurried look at the Jam Island when the
derailed train tipped him out. A broken arm
is his share of the trouble.
Justice Heydon had the luck to leave
Tasmania before the train smash which
shook up so many trippers. He and his
verse-writing lady are back in Sydney.
The Women's National Council —annual
corroboree —meets this year in Hobart. The
committee thoughtfully picked the early days
of March for the fixture. Such questions
as “What are you prepared to do in war-
time?” will be asked at the point of the
knitting-needle.
Trooper W. S. Blue, who died some weeks
ago at Alexandria, was a stepson of the late
Chief Justice Way, of South Australia. In
the pre-war days he was a member of the
Adelaide Hunt Club and a horseman of
note.
Perth's Anglican Archbishop Riley, who
came this way a while ago, has a son in one
of the German prison camps. He had com-
parative luck in his captivity, and was better
treated than most prisoners by the gentle
enemy. He is at Crefeld —or was some weeks
ago.
An Australian woman just out from Zep-
seeing in England remarks: "“Round Win-
chester there are camps containing in all
not less than 20,000 men in training. Yet
the rare sight of a drunken man in uniform
is considered a local scandal. Good feed-
ing. strict discipline and a wet canteen,
backed up by tea and coffee tents, are the
main causes of this happy state of affaii’s.”
The organising of voluntary workers to
run up huts and clear the land for wounded
soldiers is progressing at French’s Forest.
The idea is better than the soil, which is
medium to bad. Difficulty of access and
lack of water are the main drawbacks to
success on the hills beyond the Spit. On
Saturday afternoon about 340 stalwart men
e\acuated their coats to smite the uninspir-
ing earth with spade and mattock. Dr.
Mary Booth has selected two plots for sol-
diers’ widows, and has under her unroving
eye a party of Harbor Trust men who are
putting their muscle into their preparation.
North Sydney gas employees, who are also
on the French’s Forest reclamation, go two
hours earlier to their ordinary work on
Saturday, so as to make an early dash for
the site of their special labors. These Tro-
jans also give up their Sundays to the spade
work. Miss Tindall has rounded up the
Women’s Blue Gum Association, whose hap-
piness it is to succor the patriotic laborer’s
on the job with nourishment.
Miss Brace, the horticultural enthusiast,
just back from Europe and America, went
over the French’s Forest scrub land on
Saturday. She has offered to take over a
five-acre plot, and lay it out (just for love)
for a soldier’s widow. Miss Brace claims
that three acres are quite enough for a
woman and her children to deal with. In-
tensive culture on the French system is her
idea. Meanwhile jour prayers for an im-
proved rainfall at Fi'ench’s Forest are
urgently required.
The “Under Fire” matinge for returned
soldiers had a sweltering afternoon to see
it through. Hugh Ward decorated a box
with Colonel Bob Owen. The Wollongong
soldier is still lame after his damages in
Gallipoli. A slender Mrs. Bob and small
daughter helped to swell the applause when
the last act brought the retreat (off stage)
of the German army. A J.C.W. chorus and
the principals from Her Majesty’s tossed a
few ditties off their chests before the new
curtain rolled up. It’s a handsome bit of
crushed rose-tango drapery, in place of the
shabby old red velvet veteran. Frank
Harvey, who is taking; Julius Knight’s old
place as matin6e idolj looked “positively
beautiful” (I quote something tender with
its hair in a plait) as Larry Redmond.
Are the pork-pie hats really coming in
again? This headgear, like a small pan-
cake laid on an inch or two of foundation,
made a furtive bid for favor in 1915. Un-
fortunately, ladies with faces like' the desert
moon, were the chief votaries, so the pie
was cooked. Easter may revive the pill-box
size in millinery. But if it does, Heaven
help the heavyweight dames who perch these
trifles on deck.
Swimmer W. Longworth has lately been
thrilling the girls by showing his manly
form in khaki. Several recent tea-parties
in a fashionable hostel were quite excited
by the vision of “Billy” in uniform, reduc-
ing a pyramid of buns in a handy corner.
Recently-deceased W. L. Hackett, of
W.A., was 64 when he married (10 years
ago) Deborah, a daughter of surveyor Fred
Slade Brockman. Bride was 19 at the time,
and has done her duty very well in the
matter of the birthrate. Four youthful
Hacketts carry on the enterprising old man’s
name.
An Ashfield girl, Pauline Walker, will
allow H. Waller Muddle (now at the Front)
to regard her as his very own girl when he
comes marching home. Grandpa Walker,
now passed over the shadowy border, was
one time Chief of the musty old Public
Library. Another relative, also well
remembered here, was the late Critchett
Walker, principal Under-Sec. of the Ma
State.
That fine old sport. Surgeon-Colonel
Fiasehi, invalided from Lemnos, has put up
a good recovery in a London hospital. Just
before the drums began to beat, the Sydney
surgeon had mastered the tango and mar-
ried his second wife. Then the tango gave
place to a warlike bound, and the tall, sol-
dierly figure of Fiasehi did a lightning
change into khaki.
Governor Stanley’s Private Sec.. Victor
Hood, spent his short N.S.W. holiday car-
eering off to Canberra. After a hurried look
at Duntroon’s soldier boys, he motored to
Jervis Bay, where in future Jellicoes are to
be turned out. Government official Percy
Owen was his chaperon.
A former Neutral Bay doctor, W. Mac-
donald. was packing up his stethoscope for
the Front when the last mail left London.
Another Mac, Captain G. McDonald, of
the R.A.A., in training at the British end,
had a few days’ leave in London before
going to meet the shrapnel. He had a long
look at the Welsh hills first, having been on
garrison duty in Flewelhvyn land.
The late Mrs. Walter Hall was passion-
ately fond of children. With never a
chick of their own, the millionaire
and his wife rarely missed a chance
of making some youngster happier for their
wealth. There was »a certain frugality
in their personal expenditure. At a
fashionable concert, with the guinea seats
and the “paper” in the front rows, the Hall
couple generally got 10s. worth of music
apiece behind the first barrier. She, kind
soul, was the despair of smart dressmakers,
and her gown, in the days when frocks were
fastened finally over one shoulder, was often
a frank witness of an unsuccessful struggle
to mate the hooks and eyelets.
The trustees who administer the Walter
Hall bequest cared nothing for these matters
of unnecessary detail. They had to deal with
the Woman. A mixture of shrewdness and sim-
plicity, Mrs. Hall was keen as a needle in
the management of her affairs. “Her quick
intuition picked up a point,” says one trus-
tee, “while we, who considered ourselves
smart men of business, were fumbling for
facts.” In all her personal charities she
got a fast sprint on when there were women
and kiddies to be cared for.
Solicitor W. F. Brennan’s tall son Billy
is now a joyous lieutenant at one of the
various Fronts. Egypt was the lad’s jump-
ing-off place. Billy Brennan, who used to
be on a station beyond Moree. is a handy
man with a buckjumper He has a chance
to keep his hand in with his present regi-
ment —the Light Horse.
The late Justice R. E. O’Connor’s son,
Alan, has had a long whack of training
with the Leinsters in Ireland. He is likely
to be in the firing-line any day this month,
but he might have got there sooner if he
had stuck to his Australian mates.
The Cecil Horderns, who have two sons in
the firing-line, chose the better part. They
hurled ostentation out of the window for
their daughter Vera’s wedding. Only rela-
tives and old friends were asked to see the
cake cut at Petty’s. Vera went to her happi-
ness in a tailor-built outfit of cream poplin.
Lavender millinery with a white-lace veil
topped the bridal plumage. Sister Enid was
the only bridesmaid. The ’groom is Warren
Roberts, of Booligal station, N.S.W.
Manager Freddie Shipman and his auburn-
haired lass (Mrs. Freddie) are hereabouts.
They have lassoed Paul Dufault as a 1916
attraction.
Printer W. Brooks’s daughter went off
to England in a very full ship—the Medina.
The Sydney girl expects to find her young
man waiting on the wharf when the boat
ties up at London’s murky docks. He is a
Dr. Roberts, who’s been working with the
11.A.M.C. on the Western Front.
Cabled that F.R.A.S. is the tail that will
henceforth accompany Mary Adelaide Proc-
tor, the star-gazing daughter of the late
astronomer Richard Proctor. One of her
earliest remembrances is of being snatched
from her cot on a winter’s night, wrapped
in a blanket and introduced to a careering
comet that had escaped from the celestial
pound. -Since then rounding up the stars
has been her life’s work. When she lectured
in Australia a while ago the public didn’t
rush the discourses, but the astronomer
made a host of friends. She was in Eng-
land when the last news came this way.
The patriotic outing at Rose Bay on
March 18, in the water-lapped Motor-Boat
Club’s grounds, will tempt the generous
visitor with everything from fatted cream
puffs to guessing competitions. If that range
is not sufficiently extensive additions will be
made to suit customers at the usual rates.
The miserable claw of destiny struck a
party of Y.W.C.A. dames in Tasmania the
other day when a railw.ay smash occurred,
Delegates from the Association had gathered
at a summer corroboree at Brown's River,
and some of them were travelling on the
derailed trajn. The list of killed included
Mrs. Howell, president of the Geelong
Y.W.C.A.
Olive, the pretty daughter of Kelso King,
has been getting more than a fair share of
excitement while doing ambulance work in
France and in the Balkans. It is fretful
to spirited girls to stay at home and merely
construct socks or compose jam, instead of
being an angel aboard a motor ambu-
lance transporting wounded heroes, but we
all can’t go to the Front. If we did our
ears would blush at what the trench-boys
say about the socks and the jam from the
girls who stay at home.
Director Verbrugghen, with Judge Back-
house and Under-Sec. Board, shook hands
with the imported Conservatorium quartette
the other afternoon. Much interest is growing
in the French concert to be held in the Gov-
ernment House ex-stables, where the im-
portations will probably make their appear-
ance.
Mrs. Slap, has followed the steps of other
well-known vocalists and is warbling
across the music-hall footlights. The Tivoli
is her present address.
Greatly daring, the redoubtable “Snowy”
Baker is organising a beauty competition.
His last effort to collect Yenuses at a charity
show caused him a stack of trouble. Ladies
who considered themselves much handsomer
than the hussies who got the prizes wrnited
on the physical culture man to tell him
what they thought about it. Yet he wasn’t
even referee for the event. Undaunted,
Snowy is at it again. This time the fair
and unfair will show their points in
“Canadians” at the big patriotic carnival
on March 10 and 11. Proceeds go to the
Light Horse Comforts Fund.
The “Women’s Work in War Time”
exhibition is postponed till September. The
domestic side of the feminine creature will
then show its full capabilities.
Easter is mercifully late this year.
Woman will not therefore have to swelter
unduly in her best autumn frock, which
she insists on wearing in Show week. The
G.-G.’s ukase re races will not move our
Best People from pursuing the race-card at
Randwick. Since the Denmans’ departure
Sydney has been minus sporting Governors,
anyhow. So Potts Point is now accustomed
to back the losers without the assistance of
Gentleman Helps.
Next Saturday, February 2G. the police
and fire-brigade staffs will co-operate in rais-
ing money “to help the hospitals.” As usual
at these shows, the Roman chariot race is
likely to be the most hair-raising event.
Horatius Bluegum, in a short, red petti-
coat, bustling Marcus Superbus Suburbs, in
white ditto, round the ring ought not to
be missed. The Agricultural Ground is the
arena.
The Tivoli matinee for the benefit of the
widow of comedian Ranier was well managed.
Short, crisp items and bright artists put
the show much above the usual “compli-
mentary” performance. Dorothy Brunton,
in a frock of azure blue, encouraged C. H.
Workman to deliver a specially-good helping
of “So Long, Letty.” Peter Dawson and his
plump charmer, Annette George (who is Mrs.
Peter on the domestic hearth) sang a duet
from the Barcarolle, and for once the hack-
neyed lilt had the genuine operatic swing.
Field Fisher, Miss Nadje (the lady athlete
who ties her limbs in knots) and Connie
Ediss also improved the afternoon. Connie,
gowned in diaphanous draperv. floated from
the wing like an amiable balloon to do her
turn. The Hugh Mclntosh lady, with Mrs.
Corbett and Mrs. Wright as runners-up,
arranged the show.
A proud aunt remarks that her nephew,
Jack Dyer, is now one of the voungest
majors in the King’s uniform. The Si dney
boy. who is only 22, left here as 2nd Lieut,
in the Engineers, landed at Gallipoli on his-
toric April 20. Promoted to a captaincy
and mentioned in despatches, young Dyer
was spared to come through the Great Flit
in December. He got his majority on his
22nd birthday.
Dr. Roger Cope, of Sydney, has been
making a name for himself in the north of
France, where his surgical skill has
brought him into much prominence. A Bel-
gian soldier, who begged to have his shat-
tered arm saved at any cost, now wears a
sheep-bone in his wing, and when he speaks
of the Australian surgeon who did the job
he stands uncovered.
At a matinee the other day Marie Eaßn,
of the J.C.W. team, was braced up to the
chin in shot peacock silk plumage. The
sleeves were in quite another color and
seemed to have no communication with the
greenish-blue cuirass bodice. Marie man-
aged to sing over this lingerie fence, but it
didn’t appear to be easy.
Mrs. B. M. Koefoed. who recentlv passed
over at Auckland (M.L.) late in January
had lived 78 years in Maoriland. As a
child of two she reached Hokianga in 1537
aboard the brig Nimrod, which was then
under charter to Baron de Thierrv. the pic-
turesque adventurer who stvled himself
"Sovereign Chief’ of M.L. The girl got
her early education and religious train-
ing from Dr. Pompallier, the first R.C.
bishop thereabouts, and she went »

Stanley is a medical student. But he hopes

Mrs. M. C. King Waldron, of Sydney
who died in South Africa recently while on
a visit to her daughter, was the widow of
a former City Solicitor and one of the many
daughters of the late George Dibbs. Mrs.
Waldron’s daughter married Sergeant
Reichenbach, who is helping Botha and
Smuts wipe out the Germans.
After much advancing and retreating and
ccunter-marcliing through a maze of corres-
pondence, a settlement regarding the sol-
diers’ tea garden is in sight. Minister
Crahame has given the dames of the com-
mittee a lease of a plot of ground in
the Domain. The Government has also
shelled out £l4OO for the buildings. As
Anzac Buffets are springing up all over the
city (not to mention a suburban crop), per-
haps “Tea Garden” will serve as a label
for this adventure.
The Army Service Corps committee (IS
Barrack-street) is prepared to take your

The war hasn’t knocked out that highly
respectable and venerable institution, the
Philharmonic Society 7. It mentioned the
other day that it was feeling genteelly elated
over a credit balance of about £l5O/
> Mrs. 10. Wilder, a well-known Hawkes
Bay (M.L.) resident, spent Christmas in
England. She hurried there to help the con-
valescence of a son who was wounded in
Gallipoli. Lieut. Wilder's brother John was
killed on that tragic cliff.
The Red Cross Society is taking over the
management of Graythwaite (the soldiers’
convalescent home) forthwith.
Most Australian girls have a fairly thick
growth of hair, but the swimming damsels,
and especially those who bare their locks
to sun and salt wave, are especially rich in
what the unwashed poets call “woman’s
glory." But otherwise the mermaids who
competed in the recent carnival are out of
the beauty class. Exposure to sun and wind
dries their complexions and tans it to a
leathery substance. If you take note, too,
you’ll observe the heavy chin that aquatics
develop in the feminine. Fanny Durack,
who has .a handsome mop of tawny hair,
rolls it up in door-knob style.
„C. Beresford Cairns, a son of a forme!
X.S.W. banker, is in England. He’s trailing
up a commission in the R.F.A.
Gerald Griffin, the Irish singer at the
Adelphi. wastes some of his sweetness on a
desert of indifferent music. Such dulcet
tones might be employed to better advantage
than in lays like “Tura-lura” (or something
of the kind), “the song my mother sang to
me.”
That centenarian charity, the Benevolent
Society, holds its 103rd annual meeting this
week. Governor Strickland presides over
the tally of debit and credit accounts.
Yours affectionately.

Someone in Melbourne is hatching a new
sort of war baby—the Middle Class League
—to be composed of all persons not rich
enough to belong to Liberal Leagues or
Trades Unions. Apparently its policy is
to be opposition to freetrade. dear food, high
rents and Government waste. Its name is
another way of spelling disaster in a good
cause.

MELBOURNE CHATTER
Melbourne, February 21, 1916.
My Dear Yarrie, —
The autumn meeting, which opened at
Caulfield on Saturday, was not blessed
by vice-regals. They stayed away, and
the barren waste of empty sacred
seats stared reproachfully at the sports
who still dare to buckle on their field-
glasses. In the surrounding gloom the
bookies seemed to apologise for taking the
punters’ money; winter costumes covered the
Very Best backs, and a large number of
wounded soldiers looked as if they didn’t care
whether they were flapper-nursed again or
not.
The gracious Dolores went out and sang
to the soldiers at Royal Park last Wednes-
day night. She is “out of business,” as she
expresses it, until after the war, and only
patriotism or charity will induce her to lift
up her voice. The long rest from money-
earning brings its artistic compensations in
the refreshed charms of her warble. The
sympathies of Dolores are widely distributed
among the Allies —a French mother and a
home in France; an Italian father, and a
thoroughly British sympathy.
The Australian Motor Transporters in
France coo-ee back thanks fot- some presents.
Many packets were sent and a fair per-
centage of them arrived, which is vei’y in-
consistent, all things considered. A parcel
of good things was convoyed by Mrs. James,
a squattress of hereabouts, who went to
France to be near her husband the Major.
Someone galloped down to the boat before it
left and heaved a bundle after her, shouting
that it was “Something for the boys!” If
you listen intently you will hear the echo of
the boys’ cheers.
Adrian Knox, K.C., is little the worse for
his five months’ service as Red Cross Com-
missioner. The chairman of the A.J.C.
visited Anzac and Lemnos, and returned
satisfied that* any gifts sent along to our
lads should leave by the first boat. The
stories about Red Cross goods being sold
illicitly are he says, romance, and Molly can
rest assured when she turns the last toe of
Claude’s socks that the boy won’t have to
pay three and six for them at the canteen.
.The West Brighton Club is an exclusive
man-haunt of great age and intense respect-
ability. Lots of people have never heard
of it because, you see, most of the members
belong to the sacred Melbourne, or Athen-
aeum, or Australian, and such refuges are off
the average citizen’s beat. The crusted con-
cern came out of its cave last week and gave
a party to which ladies were among the in-
vited. All sorts of patriotic dodges were
resorted to, and a heap of money was raised
for the Red Cross.
The John Langs, now of Eurack, in the
Colac country, opened their flower-garden
and shrubbery to the Western District public
the other afternoon. Johnstone, the still-
new member for that region, did his duty by
handing over a flag to be auctioned. The
garden-party panned out over £lOO to one of
the war funds.
Miss Hook, a Riverina girl with a Burne-
Jones face and a mouse-like manner, has
come to town to try and fipd some patriotic
work. She is a grand-daughter of Mitchell,
senior, of Tabletop and other Riverina
stations. The old gentleman is in his 90’s,
but is quite satisfied.
Fanny Dennys, a member of the old Gee-
long family, is helping the Empire by serv-
ing sandwiches to the industrial soldiers at
Woolwich Arsenal.
Geoffrey Horsfall, a young English cousin
of the N. S. Wales Horsfalls, has been killed
in action. He was in Westralia when the
war bugles blew, and enlisted at once in the
W.A. Light Horse as a private, thereby
giving an object-lesson to many half-Aus-
tralians. He leaves a young wiaow and two
babies. Social Melbourne remembers him,
amongst other of his virtues, as an agree-
able race-time visitor.
Major Charlie Mason, son of the late
Speaker, is returning from England, where
he went to be nursed after being peppered
rather heavily with shrapnel at the Gal-
lipoli Landing. He got his first experience
of war in South Africa, and was Associate
to Justice Hodges, when the call to arms
hurried him back into khaki with a cap-
taincy. Mrs. Charlie has been looking after
the veteran of two campaigns ever since he
reached London.
Mrs. Alec Landale’s Algy, having put his
Gippsland wool acres out to nurse, is hurry-
ing to England to help settle the war—this
at a time when Australia is trying to make
up that extra 50,000 and wants all its own
men. Brother Douglas fell in action last
year; but Major George and Lieutenant
Gordon Landale are still in the thick of
trouble, not to mention brother-in-law Cyril,
who is doing his bit. Mrs. Algy (who was
Jean Langtree) will also make the voyage,
and will, if possible, do some nursing. But,
strange to say, they don’t deliver over
sick warriors to the care of any untrained
but willing woman in a white cap and apron.
Such are mostly rewarded, if they persist
and really want to help, with humble but
none-the-less-useful jobs which would other-
wise take up the time of trained specialists.
One officer’s daughter gets no nearer to the
battered heroes than the wardrobe which she
sorts and folds in the hospital laundry.
Scott Sharp, of Berwick, thinks he is
rapidly qualifying for war-ambulance work.
Debarred from active service by an earlier
fight with rheumatic fever, he has been Red-
Crossing valiantly. Recently he has chanced
on three separate civilian accidents that were
as desperate as battlefield cases, and has
made speed-limit dashes with them in his
motor over corduroy and blue-metal to the
nearest hospital.
The French Red Cross snips and stitches
every Tuesday and Friday in Commerce
House, Flinders-street, in a long white room
where tables gleam with white oilcloth cov-
erings. These Frenchwomen are always
thorough and thrifty, and they just frighten
the life out of a timid Australian girl if she
attempts to throw away a thread of cotton.
Mrs. Homery and Mrs. Crevelli are two of
the bosses.
The Wounded Soldiers’ Club in the Cen-
treway came out in a rash of bunting when
Mrs. Sanderson gave her party. She sang
duets with actor Tommy Shelford and in-
sisted on some of the soldiers performing.
One whistled for about half an hour on end
and won an avalanche of applause.
Tennis-champion Rod Heath has got his
aviator’s certificate in England and is going
aloft.
Adelaide, chokingly, out of the smoke: —
It was hot enough before the hills set themselves
on fire; after that it was hotter. Some 500 soldiers
from the Mitcham camp eventually settled one big
blaze with green boughs and language and other
appliances.
Just before the world lit up properly, Payneham
indulged in a patriotic carnival, which commenced
operations with a credit balance of £3OO and was
opened by the Governor. That is about the total
of the week’s dissipation. You will see by this
that the place is rapidly becoming one of the world’s
playgrounds.
There has been an exodus to Melbourne. The
Makins, Mrs. Davies Thomas and Mrs. Ernest Good
have gone; also Mrs. Edmund Fosbery. Hubby is
to follow in a week or two. No one who can pos-
sibly get out of Adelaide for a holiday stays in it.
Miss Merfe Robertson, the Elder Scholar, is to
leave by the first boat in March. A complimentary
concert will occur at the Town Hall on the first of
that month.
An interesting shooting accident is reported from
the north, where a man was killed in mistake for a
kangaroo. The men concerned were shooting at a
clam on Euridna station, and were at opposite ends,
behind brush breaks, waiting for the kangaroos to
come to water. They had arranged for a signal if
either left the shelter of his break, and when, late
at night, one of them saw something moving at the
far end of the dam and heard no signal he took it
for granted it was a kangaroo, and fired, killing his
fellow-sportsman.
Premier and Mrs. Vaughan have come back from
Kangaroo Island singing Te Deums in praise of
its glories and full of plans for its future —-including
increased tourist facilities and greater attention to
the island’s agricultural possibilities. To the un-
sociable, one of the present charms of the island is
that there are no tourist facilities —neither mails,
telephones nor accommodation. It only runs two
mails a week, and less than that for anyone not
within walking distance of Kingscote or Hog Bay.
Miss MacPherson, who was responsible for the
purchase of the much-discussed “Sowing New Seed,”
has written from England to say that she has a
dealer’s assurance that after the war the picture
will be worth twice as much as the price she paid
for it on behalf of the Art Gallery. Let us hope
it will. At present it is hiding in the Board-room
of the Public Library.
Recently-deceased Herbert Holder was one of the
best bass vocalists this State gave birth to, his voice
having the genuine quality. He had not been heard
very much lately, his only recent appearance being
his singing at the Martha Bruggemann home-coming
concert. A brother of politician Frederick, after-
wards Speaker of the Federal House, he left the
civil service to follow music, and did well, support-
ing Antoinette Stirling in her tour of the' Com-
monwealth and Maoriland in 1893, and scoring more
press notices than his principal, who mainly con-
fined her attention to ballads, while his fine voice
was shown off in operatic and classical numbers.
Kathleen, his one daughter, is a fine pianist.
Mrs. Arthur Palmer, of Bendigo, is now
thanking her stars and a bald-headed cab-
man to whom time meant nothing. She was
bound to Hobart to attend a Women’s Con-
ference. Her luggage was safely aboard the
Loongana when she hired the gradual cabbie
to drive her to the wharf. He drove so
dilatorily that she missed the boat; also the
boat-train at the other end which went to
smash. I understand the cabman is to be
presented with an illuminated address and a
purse of sovereigns for his splendid ineffi-
ciency.
Harry Marks, the Bendigo auctioneer who
helped with the famous Easter Fair for
many years, died suddenly the other day
while reading the account of the Tasmanian
railway accident, in which Miss Margaret
Karras, a next-door neighbor, lost her life.
Greta Garnett, the jolly 18-year-old Eng-
lish girl who was staying with her Australian
relations before Armageddon leaped off
its heels, is engaged to a young military man
who, after being badly wounded, escaped the
undertaker by careful nursing. He was men-
tioned in despatches and won the Military
Cross. All these particulars are supplied by
his delighted fiancee to her former Melbourne
playmates. He is soon to get his captaincy
and then they will be married. (Three
cheers!) Bobbie Tennant, a young cousin
of Greta’s who was out Here, has blossomed
into a captain at 19 years of age. He was
the only officer left in his regiment and was
in sole command for over 50 hours in the
trenches. What doesn’t England owe to
these boys!
Jack Dunlop, after many years of patrol
duty on the Block, has chanced matrimony.
He and his bride (Miss Whitty) are honey-
mooning to America, via Honolulu. _ The
bridegroom partnered in a laud ami building
business witli the gorgeous Harold Hunt.
Helen Pearson, eldest daughter of the W.
Pearsons, of Ivilmenny Park, Sale, is booked
to marry Mr. Russell, son of the general
manager of the Bank of Australasia, London.
He is heir to a title of some sort, but that’s
not his fault. Mimf, the second Pearson
daughter, is to be married presently in Eng-
land to Pat Jackson, who is the eldest son of
a baronet, and he’s no worse for that. These
sudden prospects of titles-by-marriage are
nothing to the Pearsons, who can produce
social gloss with dukes and duchesses any
time by simply shaking the family tree. They
are among the toniest of nun long-settled
Australians, and the parents,' who are in
England agreeing.. to these alliances, pro-
bably think their girls are just making nice,
sensible matches suitable to their station in
life. (Fanfare of trumpets.) Helen’s young
man is in the Navy. A submarine is his
particular care. Mimi’s bridegroom has gone
through his gruelling in -France, and has
been wounded three times. $
Popular Ida Sell was quietly married the
other day to Lieutenant.. Maney Lake, who
returned damaged by the Turk. Ida is brown-
eyed and olive-skinned, and is a relative of
handsome Mrs. Jack Fisken, whose first
spouse was David McCaughey.
Carmen Harris, the eldest Pinschof daugh-
ter, has been grass-widowing hereabouts
lately. month she catches the boat
for Vladivostock, where her husband expects
to be able to earn the family crust better
than in more civilised parts. Sister Eliza-
beth, who married an American machinery
man of the name of Finley, is now living in
Los Angeles.
The Y.R.C. Leonard pair are gloating
over their very first grandchild, a boy which
the stork delivered at the Clive Leonard
household some days ago.
The High Court Duffys, including, of
course, Associate-daughter Mary, have left
the Cliveden barracks and taken a roomy
villa in Toorak. There they can arrest their
own roses and summons one another without
interruption.
Mrs. Fred Fairbairn, who seems to dash
backwards and forwards between here and
London about twice a week, is preparing to
do it again with husband and daughter Jess
for company. The family party will journey
through Canada, where its head has acquired
some property. Jess will try and get work in
an English hospital. Sam McCulloch’s Kathie
and Violet Thornley will travel in the
shadow of the Fairbairns. They, too, are
thirsting to nurse British soldiers. One
would think we had not any military invalids
of our own to look after.
The William Cooper knight is here from
England watcliing His new horses gallop.
Thirty long years ago he used to watch
other animals that are now equine ghosts
throwing the clods behind them with their
feet. To-day the seasoned sportsman looks
no older. He walks with a stoop ; but that’s
merely a touch of rheumatism. The Orien-
tal is his temporary home.
A handful of women journalists and a
small army of brothers-in-ink gave a dinner
to Kathie Prichard, the Australian prize
novelist, at the Caf<§ Frangaise. “Jack”
Davidson, editor of the Hekald. filled the
chair unloaded the complimentary re-
marks. Kathleen, who adorned the Herald
staff before she went to London to
seek her fortune, blushed her acknow-
ledgments above white muslin and Early
Victorian flounces. She gasped nervously
when the time came to respond to the
speeches, then collapsed in a heap behind
the table decorations. Later she recovered
her nerve, sat up and said firmly, “Now
I can say what I wanted to say!” And she
said it forthwith.
Mrs. Carlyle Smythe gave a tea-partv on
one of the dog days in the hedged gardens of
~ e Cnf6, St. Ivilda Esplanade.
A ycliffe used to be the exclusive home of the
Royal xacht Club until the domestic mariners
built themselves a cabin on the sands. The
hostess wore a dress composed of little Pais-
ley foulard frills with green extras; Mre.
Dwyer attended in creamy Brussels net with
uncountable yards of narrow insertion hand-
worked into the frills; and Carrie Haase
consumed refreshments in brown muslin.
•Ifuues Brennan, whose wealth comes ffftm

The widow Phillips Fox is fixing un an
exhibition of her late husband’s paintings at
tbe Athenaeum Gallery, and Lady H e i en
Ferguson has promised to declare it open
next Monday afternoon. Mrs. Fox (she is
Ethel Garrick when she exhibits her own
work) wants to get back to Europe as soon
as possible. There are a lot of pictures that
should be taken off her hands before she goes
by admirers of the good Australian artist
who will paint no more.
Artist Berenice Edwell, who miniatures
the Very Best people, is back from her
native Tasmania, where she has been doing
some important commissions for nutshell
portraits.
Ida and Annie Rentoul are brewing a
new book between them. What isn’t pic-
tures will be verse.
Another argument produced .by the wor-
ried Melbourne housewife in her agitation
for sixpenny bread (the military authorities
get it for fivepence) is that chaff has fallen
£lO a ton since bread was 9d., during the
drought. The high price of flour and horse-
feed was then used by the baker as a double
plea for a dear loaf. Now, with flour down
from £lB 155., the maximum drought price,
to £l2 10s., liorse-feed also sinking,
water for bread-making just as cheap as it
ever was, and the 1915 insolvency list show-
ing a marked absence of bakers, consumers
begin to persuade themselves -that sixpence
is really a fair price for 41b. of bread. (You
never guessed I kept an eye on the price of
horse-rations, did you?)
A suburban matron is still bewailing an
accident that happened to her. She was
enjoying a leisured morning in bed, and
there being only herself and the maid at
home, she arose from her double-bed clad
only in a Ilenry James James “nightie”
made of morning mist and a ribbon and
sauntered dreamily into the parlor to get the
morning paper. Suddenly a male footstep
resounded in the passage, and the airy pro-
menader, finding herself cut off, dashed into
a cupboard containing empty trunks and the
gas meter. As she breathlessly awaited an
opportunity to slip back to her bedroom the
cupboard door flew back on its hinges, and
she found herself face to face with an
amazed gasman. How crowded the meto-
reading profession would be if such surprises
were frequent.
Blytheswood, the old home of David Syme,
was sold after the death of his widow the
other day. Son Geoffrey bought the place
and is preparing for a flitting from Banool,
where he caught the armed jewel-hunting
burglar. A huge new staircase is being built
into the heart of Blytheswood, and the old
house is being remodelled round it in such a
way as not to interfere with the garden,
which is a prize-winner even among the fine
Yarraside homesteads. Old Mrs. Syme used
to spend hours every day, under a huge,
shady hat, sub-editing shrubs and coaxing
seedlings with a trowel. When the place
was sold, all its contents (which were many
and various) had to be divided into six equal
portions and sold. The old lady had a mag-
pie love of collecting useful things. She
had immense stores of reserve kitchen-ware
packed away—enough to last another life-
time of even Mary Ann breakages. Another
collecting fad embraced vases, which sire had
by the hundred. One thing the family
especially appreciated was her accumulation
of diamonds. She loved to collect unset and
beautiful stones, and Mrs. Geoffrey now has
a-remarkable rope of perfect, round opals
set alternately with diamonds. She has
also an opal pansy pendant, with a diamond
set as a dewdrop. The stones were both a
joy and a worry to the mother possessor,
who had many ways of hiding them. For
a long time the treasures were kept in a
worthless-looking biscuit tin by her bedside.
Geoffrey Syme bought all the nearest per-
sonal things belonging to his mother, aud
gave them to his wife, along with the big
grey motor in which widow Syme took her
daily drive.
Yours sincerely,
JOHANNA.

ABORIGIN-
ALITIES
“Merrigal”: Gadflies is the monniker
(technical one, Tabanidce ) of those winged pests that
dine en the head, neck, back and flanks of horses
and cattle, causing loss of temper and condition, but
no other injury. Their eggs are laid on the leaves
and twigs overhanging pools or running streams,
which are the domiciles of the juvenile gads. Spray-
ing the quadrupeds with a kerosene emulsion diluted
with 10 parts of water will damp the ardor of the
blood extractors.
THE ETERNAL FEMININE.
HE: “Well, I’m no wowser, but I just heard a remark that made me get up and leave
those fellows.”
SHE: “How splendid of you! What was the remark?”
“W.D.”: The toughest-bird competition
can end now and the iron cross be passed to the
Maori hen. When I say that, although the fowl is easily
caught and hangs around Henare’s camp, it never
appears on the menu at the tangi, my case is made
out. Boiling, baking, frying, cursing, praying, - are
all the same to the chook. He remains uneatable.
But the oil he produces is the best leather-preserver
I know; it is a sure cure for rheumatism, and if
made hot and rubbed into an axe-handle the wood
will last a new-chum almost a week.
“Pick” : I would caution any abo. who
has been sampled by a snake ag%inst trusting too
implicitly to Condy’s crystals as an antidote. Per-
manganate of potash, to some extent, will neutralise
snake-venom ; so, also, will sea water. At Merim-
bula (N.S.W.) I once saw a Chinese with the dis-
tinct punctures made by a black snake in the calf
of his leg ; and though he took no other precautions
than to give the part an hour’s bathing and rubbing
in the sea, he won. Dogs, too, when bitten take
to saltwater if it is available —and usually call round
for a bone some time later. The prime considera-
tion, however, is whether the rubbing or soaking
will reach the seat of the poison timely enough, and
that depends largely upon the class and virility of
the snake. At any time the bite of the black species,
though deadly, admits of simpler treatment than
that of the brown, the tiger, the copper head or the
death-adder, because the first-named lot has shorter
fangs, and the venom they inject is superficial and
readily reached. Young snakes, also, are less harm-
ful than grown-ups. When the full-grown, long-
fanged, angry snake has been on the job the liga-
ture, knife and strychnine are still the surest things
to head off the undertaker.
* * * *
“Bush Builder” : In B. 6/l/’l6 a returned-
from-S. America Australian commends what is known
here as pis 6 building. But the process as described
would only suit a rainless country. Owing to cost
of labor pisfj building is much dearer than wood, or
even brick ; but with a foundation built in cement
it makes a much cooler house, and, with a verandah
all round to keep the weather from it, a dry house.
But the up-to-date building for low cost and comfort
—if sand is handy—is reinforced concrete. Iron is
the cheapest good roof, with a non-conductor under-
neath. Straw or shingles on top spoil the rain-
water for use ; so do all the patent-roofing materials
I have tried. Every bush home wants a big roof,
underground tank, and wide verandahs for outdoor
sleeping. Casements are better than windows; they
give more ventilation. Even in cheap-labor England
(Hampshire) I know pise to cost more than brick.
Let anyone measure up the yards of material in a
house with walls two to three feet thick, and he will
be staggered.
“McG.”: It has been stated that the
toad fish is rarely found outside of Japanese waters.
In the Swan River and in the waters surrounding
Fremantle “blowy,” as he is named, abounds and
has earned the heart-hatred of every fisherman who
inhabits the district,. For many years past he has
been a terrible pest. In Dago Bay, on the Swan,
where the fishing-boats anchor, I have fed hundreds
of them from the hand. The brute usually swallows
the hook about down to his tail, and his toad-like
look and slimy feel often excites a feeling of nausea
in the amateur fisherman.
“Tropicus”: Whiting will stop most in-
sects, but it is not in the race against ants with
turpentine. Simply soak a rag in turps and wrap it
around the legs of the beer-case, or the rope of the
flourbag that holds it to the ridge pole, and you
will not be worried any more by the little pests.
In hot weather the rag needs dipping every two or
three days to counteract the evaporation. Another
dodge is to use citronella oil instead of turps, but
the latter is much better.
“Pick”: “Breast-Plate” (B. 3/2/’l6)
asks a remedy for sore shoulders on a horse. What
kind of horse? If a hard-fed animal in regular work
the remedy is a better-fitting collar with a depres-
sion over the sore until it mends, but if the trouble
conies from gall or sweat-boil on a fresh horse, or
one constitutionally soft (in which case the wounds
renew every time the animal is harnessed up), bath-
ing with tepid water and boracic acid after work,
and applying lard and sulphur ointment will work
wonders in under record time.
STILL HOPE.
EDITOR : “No, I’m afraid your sketch is no good for our purposes; your style’s too gro-
tesque.”
ARTIST: “Then you recommend me to give it up as a had job?”
EDITOR: “By no means! Why not take on a job illustrating fashions for women?”
“Sarto”: Never before have I seen the
bush trees here (Southern Riverina) looking as beau-
tiful as they do now. After last year’s drought one
marvels at their recuperative powers. Last year on
grassless hills and lowlands the trees and bushes,
large and small, old and young, looked gaunt and
hungry and withered, as if in the first stages of
some wasting disease. Now one sees all shades of
green, fresh, glossy and nourished, on dale and hill,
standing a foot deep in golden grasses. When sil-
houetted sometimes against a clear blue sky, some-
times against a sunset that resembles a huge palette
on which every color has been daubed, the bushman
has a picture that he loves and admires. Among
the trees feed sleek-coated horses and cattle that a
year ago were fighting for life. One sees also every
conceivable shape and form of insect —absurd crea-
tures, harmful or harmless, whose only missions in
life are to destroy fruit and vegetables and nourish
the myriads of birds that call aloud that the world
(or Southern Riverina, at all events) is good to live
in.
* * * *
“Mulga”: Tell “F.C.” (B. 13/1/T6),
who wants to know what sort of pine makes the best
fencing posts, to use cypress pine. The boundary-
fence of Cypress Downs station, between the Bollon
and St. George (Q.), is of this timber, and when
writer last saw it, although it was over 40 years old,
there was no sign of decay.
* * * *
“Barcoo”: “Dicey Iron” (B. 27/1/T6)
identifies the large black-headed snake I mentioned as
the N.Q. tiger, but Q. has no tiger-snake. lam natu-
ralistically acquainted with the crawler. He is the
larger of the only two species of true pythons found
in Australia. The black-headed rock python (Python-
ince aspiditoes) lives to a hoary old age and will
reach in rare specimens to the length of 18 to 20
feet. His commissariat department can deal with a
fair-sized wallaby, and when meals are handy the
beast is remarkably swift and vicious in attack. He
throws the coils of his body round the victim
and by constriction quickly makes his kill. This
Python will show fight to anything coming between
it and its objective, particularly so during the honey-
moon season. His only cousin on this mainland
( Pythonince amethystinus) is an even brown all over
and rarely reaches more than nine feet. But it has
all the characteristics of the relative, except that
it is not so vicious and, consequently, escapes being
dubbed the tiger also. It prefers taking up its
abode about or under buildings, rocks, or large heaps
of logs, coming out to forage during the night only.
* * * *
“Barcoo” : Bovril Estates in the Northern
Territory, with its herd of 150,000 head of cattle
running over an area of 9,250,000 acres, is easily
the largest cattle ranch in British Dominions, if
not in the world. The original proprietary was
Kidman, Forrest and Emmanuele, of West Aus. Big
John, on one of his little trips inland, spied out
this almost perfect grazing country on the Victoria
River, and gauged its possibilities. Rolling plains
of grazing land are blessed with natural water-
ing places and lagoons, as well as the finest
tidal river in Aus. to float stores up to within
a few miles of the head station. The property was
known as Victoria River Downs till Kidman floated
it into a limited liability co. in England, retaining
largie provisional interests and a seat on the direc-
torate. It is a second Bowen Downs, as that
station was 33 years ago, with 170,000 cattle,
occupying the whole of the Mitchell district (Cen-
tral Q.), and a portion of the Barcoo. The Mitchell
district now runs 5,000,000 of sheep and supports
■ half a dozen of the most up-to-date inland towns in
the Commonwealth. The prophet who would have
foretold that Central Q. wool would sell for 35Jd.
per pound in Brisbane in 1916 would have been care-
fully watched for further developments. The table-
lands of the Victoria River have been geologically
guaranteed to the directorate as being water-bearing,
and boring is to be proceeded with. The whole of
the harness used on this large station is produced on
the premises from the co.’s own hides, grown and
tanned on the ground. The lime for the first process
is burnt on the station, and the tannin is from a
liquid made from the bark of a local tree. The
station wheelwright and blacksmith produce all
vehicles used of local woods.

“O’Phimerty” : The bush hermit is gener-
ally a broken-dowm alcoholic, but not always. I met
one in the ranges of Western Tas. who was working
a tin section. His claim was beside a packhorse
track, traversed about six times a year, and he
scarcely ever saw the face of man except when the
pack-drivers came along, bringing his supplies and
taking his tin. He told me he had a ten-year-old
grand-daughter and explained that he could live
cheaply in the bush and make enough to give her a
good “schoolin’ ” up in Launceston. Then he
pointed to the hills around. “There must be some
good shows there,” he said. “I’m out here lookin’
for them. Some day I’ll find one an’ then the little
girl can get all she wants.” I hope he found
a good mine before now. A few years ago at Port
Sorell, an abandoned convict station on the North
Tas. coast, I came across an ancient woman practis-
ing the hermit life. She said she was 80, and
looked it. Her husband had been an official of some
sort in the old days and had died there, and she
would be quite content to die in the same place.
Supplies were brought to her once a week from a
settlement a few miles away, but otherwise the old
lady lived in complete solitude.

“Scary Bird” : Allow me to throw in my
Bst. nothing in support of “Rag’s” assertion (B.
20/l/’l6) that “if it is native flowers we're after we 11
have to head for the Golden West.” Having zig-
zagged Maoriland and every State in the Common-
wealth, nowhere have I beheld such a profusion of
native flora as bedecks the auriferous belts of the
Murchison, Yilgarn and eastern goldfields and the
western falls of the Victoria and Darling Ranges
right around to the southern coast. Apparently in-
different to the scanty rainfall, everlasting daisies of
every tint intermingle with the pigeon-blooded Sturt-
pea,. the quaintly-beautiful flannel-flower, and an
endless variety of dainty flowerlets, the lot inter-
twined by the searching tentacles of the beautiful
red-runner to form a gorgeous carpet as far as the
eye can reach and exuding a fragrance calculated to
intoxicate. The more moistened coastal areas, from
Sharks Bay around to the Esperance, form a practi-
cally continuous garden, notably of the “kangaroo
paws,” with their dull beauty of variegated velvet,
rich orchids, cowslips, maiden-hair fern, mayflower, a
small bushy clump of innumerable miniature daisies
and the fragrant pink, yellow, brown and blac'
boronia of the sou-’west. Above all, and no less
exquisite, is the gorgeous over-growth of watt e
blossom, Christmas-bush, flowery gums, and the unique
spectacle of the “banshee-nut.” Many a venturesome
pioneer has had his lonely grave richly decorated y
Nature in this land of flowers.

THE BLACK RIDER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
On the. slope of Crow’s Nest, one of the highest
peaks near Wellington (M.L.), there is a clump of
trees, known as The Black Rider.
Who says it is only a clump of trees,
Odd-fashioned and dwarfed, through growing
On a saddle that soars where the blue-gowned breeze
To the cloud-crested peaks is blowing?
We know that a warrior rides up there,
Be he cavalier, knight or Norseman;
For we’ve heard many times in the moonlight fair
The jingling spurs of a horseman.
Oh; Crest upon crest, the hills aspire
Towards clouds that forever follow
Their sombre shadows, and never tire
Of skimming o’er hill and hollow.
And straight up the brown, grassed ridge he spurs,
In the dawnlight towering larger;
Oh the warrior rider scarcely stirs
On the back of his restless charger.
The old folk tell how his bit-bars ring
In the grey of the twilight often,
Where, close to the knees of the ranges, cling
The twinkling lamps of Crofton ;
When the overland trains have thundered through
And Night hides levels and bridges,
And the tired winds rest in a bath of dew,
The rider yearns to the ridges.
If he reaches the crest of the ranges bold—
As he might, on a misty morning—
Will his trumpeters come, as in days of old,
To sound us a challenge or warning?
Oh! this is the word that the old folk speak—
And they are the ones for knowing-—-
When the rider has won to the lonely peak
The winds will for aye cease blowing.
You tell me that this, which I count as true,
Is only an old fools’ story—
That nobody rides to the skyline blue,
Or spurs ’neath the midnight glory!
Oh! sad are the people who see no way
From fanciful themes to borrow—-
There’s scarcely a night but I look and say,
“Perhaps he’ll win out to-morrow.”
MAORILAND.

Ufye AEO LI AN-VOC A LION
"CALLS FORTH HIDDEN BEAUTIES FROM YOUR RECORDS."
The Evolution of a “Soul in an Instrument.”
From the dim beginnings of a great conception to the consummated
triumph of its achievement it is a long journey. But to-day it is possib e
to look back from the Aeolian-Vocalion (that last link in the evolution of
the Disc Machine) and see —the Talking Machine.
The metallic sounds are gone. The flaws of unco-ordinated parts are
gone. The lack of nicely discriminated character differences in tone, as
between instrument and instrument —is gone. The old maddening
monotony of set, unvarying records is gone.
What do these sounds mean in a Disc Machine? They mean that
through its Sound-box the Aeolian-Vocalion can develop a tonally perfect
balance hitherto buried in your records.
We invite you and your friends to visit Pianola Hall between 9 a.m.
and 6 p.m. Hear, in a private room, any records you desire —to be played
for you. If convenient, we suggest that you bring with you one or two
of your own familiar records.

“Bad Australian”: I rise to state with
deference and in a conciliatory spirit that “Pick”
and other Bulletin writers are talking through their
lids when they say that the glib mimicry con-
stantly attributed to the lyrebird is a delusion. I
don’t know anything about “Pick’s” fowl that is
hatched out on the Tafttawonglo, hut I do know
that his blood relation who builds his mounds between
the headwaters of the Buffalo and Howqua rivers
(Vic.) does imitate the call of the wonga, just as he
would that of the whampoo if he lived in the
Bananaland scrubs. As well as the black cockatoo’s
querulous growl, he has learned the ear-splitting
screech of the sulphur-crested white cocky, the clear,
cheery song of the magpie, the musical call of the
bellbird, the short, sharp snap of the whipbird, the
chatter of various kinds of parrot, and the great
brown kingfisher's demonstration of a vacant mind.
He is not quite perfect in his imitation of “.Jack’s”
derisive hilariousness, but the wr.y he hits off
a suddenly-startled flock of lories and the harsh,
grating cry of the galah marks him as a true
mimic. I have listened to “Superbus” in his
native lair for months together, but I could never find
that he had any particular statement of his very own
to make except the monotonous “plirk-plirk, plirk-
plirk-plirk” with which he greets the early dawn
and ushers in the dewy eve. (Copyright in U.S.A.
and Latin Amurrica.) By tlie way, I’ve never seen
the lyrebird and scrub-turkey scratching in the
same gully. What is the northern limit of the
lvre, and where does the other mound-builder hit
his southerly “thus far and no farther” ?
“Barcoo”: What about the straightest
wood in the Australian bush, I hand up for exam-
ination, from Queensland, rosewood. Workers in
cabinet-making generally refer to this timber as
“wild mahogany,” on account of its close resem-
blance to that valuable vegetable when worked up.
Trunks of rosewood running from 15 to 30 feet in
length are as straight as a lead-pencil, and the log
does not taper, or very little, being of a compara-
tively uniform thickness from the butt to where
the top limbs branch. These carry little foliage,
and the bark is the thinnest known to timber
experts. The outside of the wood is covered with
a protective layer of white-looking sap-wood, resem-
bling hickory in texture and just as tough. It is
about an inch in depth and underneath it is the heart
1 of the tree, which is exceptionally close-fibred and
heavy, blood-colored wood. It lends itself admirably
to cabinet-making, furniture-making or wood carving
of any description. After being worked up it will
take a very fine high polish and, if properly dry,
does not shrink. Rosewood is to he found all
over Queensland, along the slopes on either side of
any of the main ranges, particularly towards the sum-
mits, and appears to thrive luxuriantly amongst the
rocks and gravel of the heights.
“J.G.”: Re adobe or mud-brick houses
(B. 6/l/’l6). There are thousands and thousands
of Australian homes built of these sun-dried bricks.
Upon the northern Vic. plains there are any amount
of them, ranging from two-room cottages to eight-
room villas. The bricks made in l ie. are mostly
18in. x 9in. x 9in., and they are variously termed
sun-dried bricks, German bricks, and Egyptian
bricks. AVhen well made a house of these cakes is
practically everlasting, being immune from white
ants, fires or other destructive agencies. It is
related that the only building that resisted the big
San Francisco earthquake and fire was a century or
more old adobe building erected by Spanish priests.
In building the danger to he guarded against is damp
from the foundation. This is done by giving the
foundation a liberal layer of coal tar, or one of the
patent dampeourses on the market. I built the first
house of the kind where I am now living, and the
natives thought I was a harmless sort of lunatic
playing with wet mud. When I had finished making
and drying the cubes everybody for miles around
assured me that a building erected of such material

would come down, like a heap of sugar, when the
first rain came. After the shack was finished it
rained for about a week solid, and the neighbors
turned out to see my heap of ruins. I was really
sorry to disappoint them. For the outside of an
adobe building nothing is better than to smooth
the walls and then give two or three coats of cement
wash, that is, a little cement in a good drop of
water, mixed like ordinary whitewash and applied
with a whitewash brush. Or the walls can be
planed smooth, given a couple of dressings with oil
and then painted any color.

COP (officiously): “Your name and address, if ye please?"
TRAMP: "Well, they calls me Billy the Tangier, an’ me address is Number One, the
Open Air. If yer call, don't knock, hut walk straight in."
“Lagani-Namo”: “Maskee’s” par (B.
13,/1/’l6) re W. African driver ants reminds me of
an experience on the Brown River (Papua). The wet
season introduced the ants, and for three days they
came in systematic order, thousand by thousand,
million by million, billion by billion, trekking through
tlie scrub in continuous line. The main body occupied
about eight inches from flank to flank, and every
three inches along each side of the column were
what I assumed to be the lieutenants. Each regi-
ment was, I should say, some ten feet long, then
there was a gap of about a foot where the battalion
commanders tramped along with their despatch
riders, buglers, etc. I didn’t see any of the field-
marshals nor the generalissimo, but such of the
officers as I did see were . quite distinguishable by’
their size, actions and dignified deportment. It
would have been risky business for any’ creature
smaller than an elephant to have stood in the way
of that cavalcade.
* * * *
“Coolibah”: “Myall” (B. 13/1/’l6) de-
scribes the note of the black cockatoo as being simi-
lar to that of liis white cousin. Except that they are
about equally discordant, there is no more similarity
in their noise than there is in their mode of living.
Black cockatoos of both varieties (there are two,
identical in all' respects save that one clan affects
crimson trimmings to its underwear whilst the other
displays pale yellow) come into the coast' scrubs and
swamps in dry’ weather to feed on the tea-trees and
drag the soft, white grubs out of swamp oak and
mahogany. They frequently eat away large limbs
and even fair-sized trunks of dead mahogany in
search of their favorite diet. Scrub plums and red-
oak acorns supplement the menu, but a maize patch,
though it draws white brother in countless hordes,
has no attractions for blackie. He is a dolorous-
looking creature, and his plaintive wail and lacka-
daisical flight seem to fit his general character. His
constitutional objection to the floods of the coastal
regions prompts him to leave hurriedly at the first
breath of the monsoonal season. Wherefore the
coast selector when he hears the dolorous wail high
in the heavens and sees the black cockatoos rising
and falling like dark-hued butterflies between him
and the’ sun while they make ever west, is satisfied
that there will be “something doin’ ” in a few days
—and there usually is.
“Darvel”: If that returned Australian
who mentioned the matter (B. 6/l/’l6) will go
Outback, particularly in W.A. and Victoria, he will
find that a large number of houses are built of adobe
and tapia. They 7 go by the name of “bat” houses
or “pug” houses, and are made of soil mixed with
straw or stubble, or, in some places, with fine
gravel, which makes them very durable. Strips of
hoop-iron or bale-iron prevent them from cracking,
which is one of their chief faults. Pug walls are
made the same way, sometimes over wire-netting.
A good plan to keep the outside walls weather-proof
is to give them a coat of boiled oil.
“Bull Ryan” : O’Grady had engaged Cas-
sidy to dig and burn out a paddock of blind stumps,
i.e., trees that had previously been burned, off at
ground-level. The rule is that the boss inspects the
holes before the earth is finally filled in. The price
was one shilling each, and O’Grady was astonished
at the speed of Cassidy in finishing the job, but he
found no roots left and told Cassidy to fill in and
then get his cheque. O’Grady discovered Cassidy’s
method of speed when he started to plough. The
latter had opened a hole close to each stump and
burned a few brambles in it for O’Grady’s inspection.
The thrown-out earth hid the stumps until that was
over, and now there is a wild-eyed cocky mourning
for a man who will never return.
“Searchlight” : Some of the North fv
districts produce splendid “sportsmen” r ° ast
that is how they would describe themselvef

“J.C.A.”: “Barcoo” (B. 18/l/’lC)* writ .

at Broken Hill (N.S.W.) a few years ago. I a J

mission. Suddenly he toppled off his machine and
when we reached him he was dead. There wa

average of 270. The best I have seen is 220 hut

1 know of several women who have done the sewine
this year, and as the work is not laborious it should
he a better occupation than trying to put knowledge
into the heads of bush youngsters at £26 per annum.
“Wal” : The wild and woolly Papuan moun-
taineer is a creature of strange habits and unplea-
sant morals, but in most matters he displays a
childlike innocence and ingenuousness. During mv
ramblings through the Owen Stanley Range 1 came
on some people who were “wanted” for the oblitera-
tion of a contemporary tribe. After capturing the
principal criminals I had to investigate the causes
of the massacre, and found it had arisen through
the death of a woman resident in the raider’s vil-
lage. This woman had been on a friendly visit to
tlie other tribe, and on her return home was attacked
by an illness, probably dysentery, that took her to
the boneyard. As she lay dying she informed her
relatives that she had dreamt that her illness was
caused by an old man, noted as a sorcerer by the
hillmen, and she asked that her brothers should go
down to the sorcerer’s village and “take- payment"
for her death. This was solemnly promised by the
assembled savages, and then the lady passed in
cheerfully. My informant, an old chan much bedaubed
with paint and very much in need of a bath, toi
this yarn : “After waiting for the proper time following
the woman's death, and eating all her husband’s pigs
and yams, we got the warriors together and went
on the warpath. We hid ourselves close to the medi-
cine mail’s village, and after a wait until mid-
day we caught a woman and let the young men of
our party blood their clubs on her. She was
an old woman, so she was not worth taking as a wTre
for any of our young men. We laid all day fn the
grass and watched the village until just after sun-
set, when we surrounded it and cut our way in
through the stockade. This we did without noise,
and then we threw spears through the thatch of the
roofs and sides of the houses and made the people
come outside, where we clubbed them all. They
were easy to kill because we had many more men

HIS VALID EXCUSE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
His name was Bill; just Bill. He had
A dial hard as any brick.
His record was distinctly bad,
And recently he’d tried to kick
Tlie head clean off his little wife.
The dame, in terror of her life,
And hoping for a lasting peace,
Called in at length the local p’lice.
He stood before the Beak, red-eved ;
Six foot at least there was of him.
The copper told how he had tried
To tear his missus limb from limb,
And how he drank, and never gave
A penny piece her life to save.
Complainant swore the tale was true,
And showed her bruises two by two.
The Beak began to moralise: .
The man was big, his wife was small.
“Why not hit someone who’s your size?
You ! ve surely heard your country call?
If you’ll--enlist, we’ll let you go.
It’s up to you to smite the foe.”
“Yer right,” 'said Bill. “They orter get me—
I’d ’list, but, ’struth, me wife won’t let me!”

are sometimes more susceptible to COUGHS and COLDS on the
CHEST than the young and vigorous. When an aged person gets
a Cold, it is of the utmost importance that not only is the BEST
REMEDY taken immediately, but that the Remedy is one that
doe 3 NOT cause any Heart Depression, nor in any way weaken
an already frail constitution. In such a case, HEARNE’S Bronchitis
Cure is just THE proper Medicine to use, a 3 it is the QUICKEST,
SAFEST and BEST—a Remedy that is just as effective with
YOUNG PEOPLE.

“W.A.R.”: The question is whether J. B.
Suttor, the Ma State’s Commercial Com-
missioner to the East (which means the
North) ought to be interned as a traitor to
his country. “As a result of the efforts of
his office,” Sydney Daily Telegraph
reports that prominent Jap mining engi-
neers are about to visit Australia to dis-
cover what commercial ores this continent
is capable of supplying to Japan. Aus-
tralia, having managed to get rid of the Hun
control of our metals, J. B. Suttor proposes
to hand them over to Japan. Can’t the
Australians ever do anything but excavate
the most valuable portions of the continent
and ship it to foreign countries?

The Sydney house of Lipton’s received the
surprise of its life the other day when a
local firm of agents passed on an order for
some cases of tea to be forwarded to the
“Hamburgische Sudsee-Aktiengesellschaft,
Rabaul.” The co., however, wasn’t taking
any risks, and rushed the incriminating
document off the premises. Inquiry at the
Customs revealed the paradox that selling
goods to the Hamburgische Sudsee-Aktien-
gesellschaft was not trading with the enemy.
Why wasn’t quite clear, though presumably
the business is now in the hands of an offi-
cial trustee. But considering how unplea-
sant the local loud-mouthed, cold-footed
Hunstrafer can make things for the firm
with Hun customers on its books, it would
be much more satisfactory for everybody if
the Administration granted such a trustee-
managed concern the temporary use of an
inoffensive trade-name such as “Smith, Jones
and Co.” Just at present a Hunnish order
in an Australian business house is less
acceptable than a bad debt for a couple of
thousand.

A “naturalised” German barber in Mel-
bourne who employs German labor was fined
£l5 last week for having changed his name
to the “Globe Hairdressing Saloon,” which
was a characteristic suggestion of Ger-
many’s proposed world conquest, anyhow.
Also a number of German bakers (less open
to secret service suspicions than barbers
are) have been fined for trying to change
their identity. But liow about the number
of German commercial agents —travellers or
indentors —who are changing a letter or two
in their names, and calling themselves loyal
citizens of Swiss or Danish parentage? The
eye of the law that so easily detects the
shopkeeper’s trick should be turned towards
the Ilun who conceals himself in an up-alley
little office.

“Norbell”: Consider, the neat little printed
slip I just peeled off a collapsible metal tube
of allegedly Australian-made dentifrice. “It
is regretted that a key is unavailable for
this tube owing to short shipment from
Great Britain. A supply is expected shortly.”
I don’t know what it cost to prepare and
print this elegant apology for a poor little
piece of foreign ironmongery, but I do know
that any school kid with a pair of pincers
could fashion the missing key from a bit of
wire in two minutes. Still, it’s early yet;
when we have learned to make clothes-pegs
we’ll practise on a few other odd jobs.

R. S. Webb, late U.S. Forestry Bureau
Investigator, now in Australia, reckons that
this country has an asset that should be
particularly handy after the war. There
will be, says Webb, such a call for building
timber throughout the fighting zones that
it is hard to see where it is all to come
from. Certainly the U.S. won’t be able to
produce it, because even now the local
building trade is hobbled by short supplies.
Jonathan, however, is directing a reflective
look towards the future, and has commis-
sioned Webb to send home seeds of various
Australian trees for re-afforestation pur-
poses. What that may yet mean to Austra-
lian trade may be guessed at by anyone who
remembers South Africa’s acclimatisation of
the wattle. Meantime, Webb calls upon the
N.S.W. Forestry Department to get busy,
because
Australia should have a golden opportunity of supply-
ing a large amount of ironbark, tallow-wood, black-
butt and spotted gum where strength and dura-
bility are required, with our beautiful indigenous
oaks, blackwoods, rosewoods and others where orna-
mental, fine grain and woods of delicate textures are
needed.
Unluckily, a vast percentage of “our beauti-
ful indigenous,” etc., is ballooning up in
smoke, and no one with the needful autho-
rity seems unduly worried about it.

Albert Mullett, possibly stimulated by
some of the patriotic remarks on Australian
trees and natural resources which, as Gov-
ernment Printer, he observes from time to
time in the Victorian Journal of Agricul-
ture, is persevering with his inquiries and
experiments relating to the manufacture of
printing-paper from local wood-pulp. The
thing can be done, he thinks ; but the mar-
gin of financial advantage may at first be
small, or nil. Mullett’s idea is that, by
keeping the subject alive, he may yet com-
bine the right machinery, raw-material and
chemical-treatment. Anyway, the matter
will be considered shortly at a meeting of
State political satraps.

“Spraggs”: Simpson the traveller told
me the story. Blobb and Co., his firm, once
sent a ton of flour up the north-eastern line,
and through some mistake kept no account
of the customer’s name or town. The office
staff searched the books and found there
were 27 customers on that particular stretch.
After consultation the stray consignment
was tacked on to each of the 27 accounts,
and all hands held their breath and settled
down to wait. They expected 26 customers
to deny having received the supply ; and one
to pay. But they fainted when 18 custo-
mers sent cheques without a murmur, while
nine declared they knew nothing about it.
I always had an idea there was money in
flour.
* * * *
“O. J. 0.”: In some Bolivian towns there
is an ingenious system in vogue to keep
the bakers from cheating the public. Bread
is sold in small rolls at 10 cents (say 2d.)
each, but the Law says nothing about the
weight of the roll. Outside municipal build-
ings there is a large blackboard, on which
appear the names of all the bakers in the
town, with the average weight of the rolls
that each is selling that day. It is a fine
example of misguided energy. The police
do the weighing for recording purposes in-
stead of for purposes of discovering offences
against a fixed weight law. Still, we who
live in this enlightened country had better
not, when making fun of such a system,
mention the law that allows bakers to make
and sell “fancy” bread (which includes all
bread not made in a particular shape) any
weight they like, without even the check of
the blackboard.
* * * *
“Rg”: There are several ways for the
modest crook to pursue the dollar on safe
and easy lines. For instance: One adver-
tises that he has money to lend on real
estate, and after negotiations have been
opened with a likely borrower insists on a
valuation by Blank. Of course a couple of
pounds is handed over as a valuation fee.
Then Blank thoughtfully inspects the pro-
perty and regrets he cannot recommend the
security. A sovereign each every few days
these bad times is very handy.
* * * .
“Hontex” : Bill has been with the firm 40
years, and as he was until lately pulling
down the same money he did 10 years before
he put it to the boss that a shilling or two
more every week would help things along a
bit. Bill got 12d. after prolonged talk. Then
I appeared on the scene and the boss men-
tioned how ungrateful some men are “To
think!” he said, “that when his old master
died we gave William the highest honor in
allowing him to lay the final wreath on
the coffin, and as soon as he is gone
he asks for a rise in wages!” I was so
affected that I left him without asking what
about my shilling.
* * * *
“Copabella”: I spotted it hidden away at
the bottom of the drummer’s sample bag.
“Oh, ah!” he said (his nose outstood, and
his naturalised firm’s name ended in stein).
Colonial stuff! Glass sugars, with cover
fsew industry, an’ all that. Very crude!”
They were crude all right, and the glass
was a bilious eucalyptus green, but thev
were the first little Australian sugars ever
offered me. (“Sugar,” understand, is the
trade term for a basin to hold the mono-
poly.) I bought freely of this first little
Australian native: first, because imported
stuff is almost unprocurable; then because
though vilely green, they were so sensibly
made —plain little useful bowls, tree from
crevices and tortured art-shapes, with a well-
covering, big-knobbed, fly-proof lid. J ust
the thing for our climate! I, therefore, din
my flag to Australian exhibit B . and may
the manufacturers go further and clarify
their raw material more. I like our sage-
tinted foliage sun-bathed in the “deep
glorious silences of the bush” ; but it should
not shriek amid the water-clear brilliance of
imported glass.
* * * *
“F.N.T.” : Australia has plunged ahead in
the manufacture of writing-ink. The latest
examples of the fluid put on sale by an
ancient stationery firm in Melbourne con-
tain at least 25 per cent, more writing
material than others, either local or im-
ported. This is the result of healthy com-
petition, and the ability to obtain the raw
material from several markets. One black
mark stands against the new production. It
carries no label to show that it is made in
Australia.
* * * #
“Copabella”: I'm beginning to smell
something. English enamelware not offer-
ing, I bought enamelled mugs last week,
allegedly from Japan, and I’ve just opened
them. I hope they’re Japanese; but the
decorations are suspiciously reminiscent of
the Vaterland. Snow-covered Tyrolean-
looking habitations, with children toboggan-
ing in fur caps, long scarlet mufflers and
round Caucasian faces, don’t inspire confi-
dence. Given the Jap gift of imitation, is
it not an excess of artistry to give us Bava-
rian landscapes and Grimm figures? Any-
how, what about an Australian mug—with
a koala or kookaburra in the foreground?
* * * *
“Saint”: One result of the war is a short-
age of all classes of glass, especially fancy
colored lines. This trade was practically
controlled by Austrian firms, and for quality
and price their product could not be touched
by other countries. English-made glass was
rough and heavy in comparison, besides
lacking the beauty of design that was found
in the foreign article. But now America
and Japan are taking a hand. The Yankee
gas and lamp chimneys and the like are yet
far from fireproof; the Japanese is bad in
finish, design and quality. Will the Ger-
man be going full steam ahead hereabouts
again when the conflagration is over? A
Sydney indent agent told the writer that he
was not disposing of his German samples.
“They will come in handy again,” he said.
Even now, large quantities of chimneys
marked “Made in Denmark” are on the
market, and it’s mighty doubtful whether
they came from that land of cows and
cheese. For bottles, it is threatened that a
rise is coming, so there’s a sad day looming
when an extra tuppence will have to be paid
for the stout which accompanies the eray.
Strafe this war!
* * * *
“Copabella” explains the mysteries of the
grocery store :—-
“Percentage” is the retailer’s bugbear, his Holy
Grail, and the foundation of all his calculations; his
career is a long (or short) struggle to strike the
happy balance between expense-percentage and profit-
percentage. Expense-percentage is the ratio of
working expenses to turnover (i.e., total trade). If,
at his annual balance, the expense percentage proves
lower than the retailer has calculated, he takes the
family to Hampton or Manly for a fortnight; if it
has been too high, he calls his creditors together or
has a fire.
The trouble is that he works in the dark, more or
less, from stocktaking to stocktaking. At that fate-
ful epoch he balances his year’s trade and finds that,
for every £lOO worth of trade he has done, his
working expenses have been, say, £l5. In other
words, he needs to make that much on every line he
sells to merely pay his way ; anything over that is
“bunce.”
There are, however, in every business a few bed-
rock lines that hardly ever pay 15 p.c. In grocery,
for instance, flour is often sold at a fixed turnover
of Is. per bag; to-day that would be 51 p.c. on
cost. Kerosene is sold for the “case” ; value, 4d. to
6d., or 5 p.c. on cost. Jam, perhaps, clears Id. a
tin = 121 p.c. on cheap lines, 8 p.c. on dearer kinds.
Provisions command 2d. a lb. gross on to-day’s
markets for butter, bacon, cheese and eggs = about
13 p.c. And so on. All these are “loss-lines,” and
recognised as such. The loss on the loss-lines must
be made up by a higher percentage of profit on the
“good” (profit) ones. All this needs very delicate
adjustment, for the latter are mostly the slow and
low-priced, and for every £ of “good” trade the re-
tailer may expect 10 to 20 of “cut” and “catch”
business. Every week the shopkeeper can, by simple
calculation, arrive at his expenses percentage; but
he can only guess at his average profit, unless he
keeps a system of costs-dissection far too detailed to
be handled by the small suburban robber. He knows
his wages are about 10 p.c. ; he thinks his other
exes, are about five, and his bad debts and eontir
gencies about two, and he should be getting another
three for himself; so he puts on 50 where he can
(he can’t often), and struggles hard for 25 on “own-
namers” and similar plums, and gets as near 20 as
he can on quick-sellei's and general business, and
pinches and saves on paper and string and overtime
and weights and discounts, and trusts to luck and
economy and the computing scales to put him on
the right side at stock-taking. It is only at that
annual boiling-down that the numbers are really up.
At the end of the hypothetical year the retailer
finds that, owing to unforeseen circs, or miscalcula-
tions, maladjustments, wage-changes, carelessnesses,
etc., his expenses have climbed up to 17 or 18 p.c. of
his turnover. And he’d worked all the year fixing
his prices on the 15 p.c. estimate. Too late to make
it up that year ; but he’ll try to carry a little more
margin next! Pretty hard to do, w r ith so many at
the game. If only he could get a bit more on sugai
or kerosene, or jam or some other of the loss-lines how
much easier it W'ould be to carry on! So he sees
Ballance and Waite and Coffey and Butters and a
few more of his competitors, and they arrange to
lower the loss on sugar by 5 p.c. And then all Hell-
Five newspapers, 17 unions, 13 crank-societies, 2093
customers, 42 suburban councillors, eight multipt
shop firms, nine women’s leagues, and Henry IV on a
rise up and curse him for a snatcher of crusts fror
the lips of the orphan and the wounded soldier, arc.
all his assistants and the driver ask for a rise!
SONG O’ SIXPENCE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
When I was in a draper’s shop
I went (it was a comic fix)
To work at eight, and had to stop
When it was six.
Penned up among the meek, sleek men,
With one-and-twopence in my pockets,
I dourly drove a dubious pen,
Dissecting dockets.
The totals were a curse to me:
I’d often feign (the sin was mine)
That four-and-eight plus two-and-three
Made one-and-nine.
(A little coin I needed then—
Being by Fortune quite unkist—
And so I was, ’mid common men,
A journalist.)
Pitt-street was calling just outside
Right wistfully—my heart upon it!
Softly, to cheat the Ragman, I’d
Indite a sonnet.
Had he but known, with anger bleak
He had divorced me from my job,
For which he paid me every week
Just thirty bob,
And nevermore my hand with glee
Had faked wild totals for the ninny.
(Two sonnets —in his time—brought me
One blessed guinea.)
So there I toiled from morn till night
And marked the dizzy figures hopping,
Or slyly watched (most gladsome sight)
Siim ladies shopping.
About the floors I’d trudge and scan,
Without affright or special loathing,
Those mysteries (alas! for man)
Called Underclothing.
I’d view the fleecy things that stood
In piles, and others hung in rows,
And wonder much how Venus would
Have looked in Those.
Sometimes I’d ask a dimpled maid,
Dull Commerce’s demurest minion;
But never would that damsel staid
Give her opinion.
Her hair was gold, her eye was blue,
Her mouth —Ave, Imperatrix ! —•
Was ecstasy. (But now, ehu!
She’s forty-six
And matronly, I make no doubt,
Plump symbol of a world gone wrong;
She wed some useful placid lout
At Wollongong.)
But even love could scarce illume
Those dreary days’ abhorred procession,
And with glad songs did I resume
Mine own profession.
And still in dreams on stuffy nights
I see the little drapers prance
And caper—those forlornest wights
Of circumstance.
It makes me very tired and sad
To see them as they dodge and snuffle;
But life is somehow, good or bad,
A ghastly scuffle,
And even drapers have to live
(I don’t know why: it does seem wrong):
So Christ ha’ pity 1 Polks, forgive
This sad, sad song....
Once I slaved in a draper’s shop.
I went (here was a comic fix)
To work at eight, and had to stop
When it was six.

There are no teeth like those furnished by

pared with a natural set.
Sensible people will accordingly try to pre-
serve their teeth as long as possible by
beeping them clean. Cold water and soap
and water are useful, but are somewhat
ineffectual. Rough powders, such as cuttle-

are too severe on the enamel.

“\[ujik” : After-the-war problems are only
going to be trifled with until they arrive.
Then the one that is hurriedly grabbed from
the accumulated heap and is made the most
noise about is the one that is going to re-
ceive immediate attention. This makes the
opportunity for Australia to formulate pro-
posals to be submitted to the Peace Con-
ference which is expected to some day
assemble. It is no use the Commonwealth
leaving consideration of what she is going
to say and do at that tribunal until the
last" moment. The attitude on all questions
should be'determined beforehand; the pleni-
potentiaries armed with schemes that will
reflect the growing altruism of humanity,
the ameliorating influence of civilisation and
the pacificatory: Briefly, Australia has the
opportunity, the leisure and the materials
for leading the way in a great universal
reform by regularising war.
What is John Bull fighting for? Because
the German leaped into Belgium. What is
France in the fray for?. Because the Ger-
man leaped into France. Why are Italy and
Austria hard at it? Well, long ago Austria
sprang on top of Italy and tore a lump out,
and Italy is now leaping back to tear the
piece back again. Why has Germany
sprung into Russia? Mainly because Rus-
sia was trying to spring over the Carpa-
thians. And Servia. Turkey, Montenegro
and Bulgaria have all been jumped on or
are struggling to jump on someone jelse. It
is a story of wars being fought in the wrong
places. The world’s greatest need of the
future is the localisation of war, the mark-
ing out of boundaries within which cam-
paigns may be waged, and where the fate of
armies and nations may be determined with-
out interfering with non-combatants, the
peaceful pursuit of trade and the develop-
ment of science, religion and art. There
was no military reason why Germany, for
instance, should have leaped into Belgium
if she could have achieved better results by
leaping somewhere else —and they would
have been better if, by projecting her multi-
tudinous armies in another direction, her
trade and commerce with the rest of the
world had proceeded unimpaired while the
disturbance raged on to its appointed end.
Germany and other countries are 'in the
same boat on this matter of leaping and
being leaped upon. They would listen to
reason, and Australia has the key to the
situation —the Northern Territory. The oppor-
, tunity of reconciling the world to President
Wilson’s Notes, and of being relieved from
disorderly conduct on the premises is unique.
The world is sick of the Notes and of war
interfering with imports and exports. Let
Australia provide the remedy.
The reform could be put in the simplest
terms. “Here,” Fisher or AY. M. Hughes
could say to the Peace Conference, “is a
record of what has happened during the
war.” (Then the speaker would read the
impressive statistics of ruined towns,
families, commerce, banks and paddocks.)
“Here, on the other hand, is what Australia
offers —a, fighting field half a million square
miles in extent —a territory at present occu-
pied by a horse doctor and half a dozen good
unionists who could be prevailed upon to
evacuate it —which can be transferred to
an International Commission on lease for
999 years, subject to renewal at valuation, as
the place where all future wars shall be
waged, without prejudice to the parties con-
cerned or imperilling the lives of people who
have nothing to do with any disturbance
which may be in progress. In fact, there is
room there for 15 disturbances to proceed
simultaneously.”
A new impetus would be given to academic
thought by this proposal. Diplomacy would
be robbed of nearly all its possibilities for
evil. The reign of law would hold sway
without damage to the ineradicable warlike
impulses of Kaisers, militant democracies
and nations with a mission or a punch. The
possibilities of such an offer being made to
the world are almost limitless. Supposing,
for example, that in a year or two Mexico
and Roumania wanted to knock one another
about. It would be a monstrous violation of
law and order if they started hacking their
way through other countries and blockading
each other and blowing up Scots and Swedes
and Italians and holding up German ships
bound in ballast for Maoriland. By regular-
ising the conflict all these objectionable fea-
tures of war could be banished. Mexican
and Roumanian could simultaneously leap
into the Northern Territory, fight their
quarrel out there amid ample spaces and in
a congenial climate, and having settled
matters restore the scenery to its previous
position and return to their respective coun-
tries, where industry would have, meanwhile,
been proceeding as usual. Not only could
Australia thus humanise war, but there is
the further and quite as cogent consideration
that by an act of stupendous sacrifice, gener-
osity and enlightenment she could, at one
great master-stroke of policy, bring herself
into the forefront of nations, stimulate her
u dustrial development, convert a huge slice
of the continent into a place* where there
would be tremendous demand for Australian
produce, secure a free gift of cash for build-
ing the Centralian railroad, and relieve the
Federal Government from such painful
necessities as appointing more Royal Com-
missions, squelching strikes at Darwin, or
saying what they proposed to do about the
matter of the Territory generallv.
unless this offer is made to a
world exhausted by promiscuous Rap-
ing madly into unauthorised places, what
js Australia going to do with the
territory? So far, the only proposals
on hand are to get more reports on the posi-
tion, the 2703 reports on hand being inade-
quate, and Kink O’Malley’s hair-brained
advice to Mahon to make himself immortal
b.v trapping a river in Papua and conveying
it to the Macdonald Ranges and establish-
ing an ornamental lake for propagating
Murray cod. Fisher’s policy about the
Territory was to valiantly say nothing at
great length. Hughes’s seems to be to handle
the situation by rooting out Germans. The
policy of Mahon, the man in charge, is to
accumulate documents and keep an open
mind. Liberal policy is to “promote
natural expansion." which is about as in-
telligent as to recommend breeding billy-
goats. But all this confusion and states-
manlike muddle is of little consequence now.
The hour is at hand, and it only requires
the man to rise and clothe in adequate lan-
guage a great project of world-redemption—-
one which will be worthy the genius of our
race and might as a colonising people—that
will vindicate the national claim that Aus-
tralians are pioneers in the region of human-
itarian experiment and in conservation until
the psychological moment of the N. Territory
for public and international purposes were
guided by far-sighted devotion to the cause
of peace and realisation of the back-yard’s
potentialities. What if the hour is allowed
to pass and another sort of psychological
moment arrives? Well, of course, a report
can always be secured, and the easiest way
of settling matters for five minutes anyhow
may be made the subject of earnest and pro-
longed discussion.
Among the many books and pamphlets and
magazine articles dealing with the German
Menace that were published prior to Arma-
geddon the most informative is “Germany’s
Swelled Head,” by Emil Reich, an Angli-
cised Austrian and a learned student of his-
tory. Reich’s book came to light in 1907.
He was not so exactly prophetic in his views
of war happenings in the near future as some
of the late “alarmists” —Robert Br.AfcH-
ford, for instance. He wrote of Germany
versus Britain, without a strong combination
of military powers against the Kaiser’s
forces. But he reckoned on the assistance of
Austria and Turkey as inevitable factors in
German aggression, and in a purely unmili-
tary spirit he discussed Britain’s perils of
public ignorance 'to weak, peace-at-any-price
government. The text of Emil Reich’s
book, which applied to all English-speaking
countries wflth equal force, proved its truth
within seven years of its utterance: —
The Germans are afflicted with the severest attack
of swelled-headedness known in modern history. The
English are practically ignorant of this dangerous
state of mind in their greatest rivals.
The preacher’s explanation of the causes of
the swelling in Germany’s hatrack was as
convincing as his comment on the danger of
it to Europe : —•
Six hundred years ago most of the Prussians
proper were still heathens talking a Slav language.
For centuries the German princes were used as
flunkeys by the older and more powerful nations
around them. Now it is common knowledge that of
all kinds of intractable pride the pride of the upstart
is the worst, the least amenable to sound limits.
The preacher of 1907 did not. as afore stated,
foresee the sending of British troops to
France for the ultimate defence of Britain,
but he was imaginative enough in his theories
concerning Germany’s future naval policy :
An entente between Turkey and Germany is even
now (1907) virtually in existence The Turkish
army, which can very well reach Egypt by land, is a
most serious factor.... It is far from impossible to
assume that the Kaiser will first create an Egyptian
war before he launches his fleet against the British.
Maybe Emil Reich was quite wrong in his
estimate of Germany’s capacity for warship
building in comparison with Britain’s capa-
city, but his .1907 opinions of the German
naval menace are a cold douche for those
optimists who assume that the many German
shipyards have turned out nothing new
except submarines since the building of Ger-
man merchantmen came to a full stop, 19
months ago. The optimists laugh at the idea
of the Kaiser’s “bottled-up” fleet being
launched against the British. Emil Reich
suggested that it might not happen until war
had been “created” in Egypt. Well, the
Kaiser is about to accomplish that creation
seemingly. And then perhaps the bottled-up
fleet wili uncork itself, and the strength of
Germany’s marine menace which alarmed
Reich nine years ago will be put to the
test. The fate of the British Empire will
turn on a big battle or two in the North Sea.
The question as to whether we have under-
rated Germany’s possibilities on the sea, as
we have under-rated the possibilities of her
land and air forces, will be settled definitely.
Meanwhile the conclusion at which Emil
Reich arrived in 1907 is not comforting. The
slackers and shirkers are advised to take it
seriously:—•
Should Great Britain, misled by men who have
never made a serious study of either history or of
the continent in its present configuration, misread the
signs of the times and continue to treat the German
question lightly, then indeed the Germans’ dream of
Pan-Germanism will not remain a dream.
Then will come Britain’s nightmare brought
on by an undue appetite for anti-conscrip-
ticn.
Parson Garnet Sliaw, who has recently
been laboring in that part of the vineyard
known as St. James’s, East St. Ivilda (lie.),
has beaten his pruning-hook into a bayonet,
and goeth forth v-itli other Australian sol-
diers to Armageddon. Shaw does not intend
to go back to the pulpit after the trouble is
over. He gives as his reason the conviction
that, though the Church is right in its prin-
ciples, it does not follow the_ principles into
practice. The clerical soldier was born at
Ballarat (Vic.) in 1877, and after he had
matriculated at Melbourne Uni. at 14 he
went clerking. Then he drifted over to
W.A., and after working at various jobs, in-
cluding a spell as an orchard hand, he pre-
sently found himself in the Nor’-West pearl-
ing fleet, where he became mate and subse-
quently master of a lugger, taking an occa-
sional turn below in the diving-dress. In
1906 he turned south, and did his course at
Melbourne Uni., and was ordained as an
Anglican parson by Archbishop Clarke.
When the Australian navy was born Shaw,
then a curate, was the first chaplain ap-
pointed, and was sent to the training-ship
Tingira in Rose Bay (Sydney). He resigned
because he differed from the Navy Office s
views of religion, and particularly because
he wanted a voluntary flock, and objected
to a system which compulsorily rounded up
the sheep to a Sunday muster.
For the first time an Australian becomes
warden of one of the colleges at Sydney Uni-
versity, the usual suggestion to import hav-
ing been turned dowm. Canon Arthur Garn-
sey. who is to take charge of St. Paul’s
College now r that its former head, Dr. Rad-
ford. has girded on the Anglican apron at
Goulburn, is the second son of now-
deceased Charles F. Garnsey, who punched
the pulpit Bible so long at Christ Church,
Sydney. Thirty-odd years ago the father,
who was reckoned very “high” in those days,
was the first to introduce to Sydney the
candles and chasubles which these times
keep Archgaiters Wright awake o’ nights and
give rise to the ever-recurring vestments
storm in Anglican teacups in the Ma State.
Son Arthur doesn’t take after dad in that
respect, but is a “broad” churchman. His
breadth was shown at a synod a few years
ago, when his wasVhe only voice to oppose
the usual motion deploring the opening of
Sydney Show on Good Friday. Going up
from Sydney Grammar School to the local
Uni. in the early ’nineties, he collected most
of the available scholarships and prizes for
classics, and, after getting his M.A. degree,
went school teaching. Though a parson, and
a Scholar iu Theology of the Australian Col-
lege, he has never pushed a collection plate,
but has earned a crust as chaplain and classi-
cal master at Melbourne" Grammar School,
and for the past seven years as head of a
theological college at Armidale (N.S.W.).
Construction of the Esperance (W.A.)
railway still hangs fire. Money was
voted by Parliament for it long ago, and on
the strength of this many families settled on
the land thereabouts. Old Gropers opposed
the line, frankly admitting that once it
started to work, trade would be taken from
Fremantle, and farmers in the S.W., where
Bigjohn Forrest originated, would receive
less for their produce because Esperance
would compete for goldfield business. But
when Scaddan and party were seeking power
nearly six years ago they swore mighty oaths
that come what would the line would be
built; also that while
it was delayed
farmers in the dis-
trict would have
their produce trans-
ported at reduced
rates. Since that
time Scaddan and
his mates discovered
that for them to re-
tain office they had
to keep in with the
Perth and S.W. bri-
gands, so promises
were forgotten and
the money voted
was spent elsewhere.
Meantime the Espe-
rance eockies have
accumulated large
stacks of wheat and
hay, etc., and heaps
of fruit and vege-
tables, all of which
are rotting.

“O.K.’s” reflections :
Listening to the comments on Wilson and
his interminable correspondence with European
Governments, any unthinking person would imagine
that the alleged simple, scholarly, flabby Wood-
row got into his billet by accident, and is cer-
tain to be thrown out of it next November. The pro-
Allies section of the American press and public tries
to maintain its own self-respect by professing to
accept the Woodrow Wilson of fiction as an untimely
fact. But the real Wilson is no accidental shuffler,
but a pushing professional Yankee political wire-
puller, who must have known as many tricks of the
game as his rivals. He is a natural, not an unnatural,
growth of America’s political system. He made a
successful bid for German and pro-German votes
before going to the poll, that’s certain; and his re-
nomination for the Presidency (placed with the Ohio
Democrats) shows that he is going on the same tack
again. His birthday greetings to the Kaiser last year
were not the artless compliment of an innocent-minded
peace-at-any-price doormat, but the deliberate mani-
festation of an old, cold tactician's desire to have the
wealthiest and most unscrupulous schemers working
for his re-election this year. Were Woodrow Wilson
only a little bit of the canting simpleton that the
outside world (or some of it) charitably thinks him,
he never would have got into American politics and
pushed himself into the front seat. Nor would he
after being there in these unpeaceful times have
dreamed of bidding for re-election.

She Darkened Her Grey Hair
A Society Lady Darkened Her Grey Hair
and Stimulated Its Growth by a
Simple Home Process.
SHE TELLS HOW SHE DID IT.
A well-known Society lady who darkened h«
grey hair by a simple home process, made the
following statement: “Any lady or gentle-
man can darken their grey or faded hair,
stimulate its growth and make it soft ana
glossy with this simple recipe. _ which they
can mix at home. To a half-pint of w ate
add #oz. of bay rum, 1 small box of Drie.
Compound and of glycerine.
ingredients can be purchased at any chemist s
at very little cost. Apply to the hair ever
other day until the grey hair is darkened
sufficiently, then every two weeks. Im-
mixture relieves scalp troubles and is e xce-
lent for dandruff and falling hair. It do s
not stain the scalp, is not sticky or grea .
and does not rub off. It will make a g re ','
haired person look 10 to 20 years younger.

POLITICAL
POINTS
Commonwealth Treasurer Higgs has had
printed in a pamphlet the report of the
interview at which three Melbourne bankers
begged him to let them export gold to the
United States—not to India or the U.K.,
which both want gold, but to Woodrow
Wilson’s country. Higgs scored heavily on
that occasion, and he might score still more
heavily if he would reprint an address
delivered by the chief spokesman of those
three bankers. In August last, addressing
the Chamber of Commerce, he quoted Lloyd
George approvingly:—
Anyone who, for selfish motives of gTeed, goes
out of his way to attempt to withdraw sums of gold
and to appropriate them to his own use—let it be
clearly understood that he is assisting the enemies of
his native land, and he is assisting them more effec-
tively probably than if he were to take up arms.
“I think therefore,” then said this gentle-
man who, eight months later, badgered the
Treasurer to let him make a little money by
exporting gold—“I think therefore we should
welcome any workable scheme which tends
not only to keep within the Empire what
gold we possess, but which will add to it.”
What would that representative banker have
felt like if Higgs had been able to t’ row
that speech at him after he had spoken?
MERELY A MATTER OF RANK.
MISTRESS: “It’s only fair, Mary, that you
should give your reasons for leaving. Is
it anything private?"
MARY: “ Private, indeed! ’ E’s bin a sergeant
ever since Christmas!"
The 16 public enterprises run by the
Westralian Government are leaking at the
rate of £144,498 a year. Some of them are
hoses. For instance, the revenue from the
sawmills for seven months has been £127,663
and the expenditure £149,333; from the im-
plement works £31,685, expenditure £84.993.
Meanwhile unhappy Jack Scaddan is shout-
ing that the Treasury figures form an unre-
liable guide to the situation and he is throw-
ing his own figures about in large, trans-
parent lumps.
Seeing that the Melbourne wharf-laborers
promise to decline to handle flour for export
elsewhere than to the British Government
until bread is reduced locally to 6d. per 41b.
loaf, in defiance of whatever the Arbitration
Court may say, and seeing that the contin-
ued retention in the country of any of its
exportable produce is a mighty unprofitable
proceeding, it is up to Premier Peacock to
consider the position. The wharf-laborers
contend that the local price of bread ought
to be 6d, per 41b. loaf, and in justification
of their demand point out that several public
hospitals are being supplied at sd. Also,
they say that the flour which they refused
to load for Java would, if shipped thither,
be converted into bread and there sold at
3|d. per 41b. loaf, which is a difference that
even the cheap labor of Java will not account
for. Possibly the Java master-baker dilutes
his flour with sawdust. Anyhow, as this pol-
icy of the wharf-laborers of constituting
themselves an unofficial Price of Foods
Board threatens to extend, the Peacock Min-
istry’s usefulness seems further on the wane.
When an outside body takes on the work that
ought to be done by Ministers it is time
these latter tried to earn their salaries else-
where.
ONE WAY OF PETTING IT.
WIFE (deeply affected): “Oh, Alfred, when
I see you in uniform I realise the
horrors of tear.”
Caucus has upheld Happy Jack Scaddan’s
resolve to cling to office until the death
knock, and unless the Liberal and Country
parties, which are now strong enough to
hand him out, combine and induce the Gov-
ernor to call Parliament together earlier
than Jack wishes there isn’t much chance
of a change of Government before the end
of July, if then. Having got into recess
by bluff and artfulness Jack now defiantly
says that he is going to hold on until the
gathering clouds of defeat roll by. Rut
they are not going to roll by. The
■work of clearing up the blundering and
shocking incapacity will have to be under-
taken. The undertaker will have a dismal
Job. - .
“The Oldest Inhabitant”: Apropos Earle
as Attorney-General of Tasmania (B.
17/f)/T6). The first Attorney-General of
New South Wales was, also, not a lawyer.
Saxe Bannister had been an army captain,
and not having a military appointment to
give him, Lord Liverpool’s Government ap-
pointed him A.-G., and sent him out to
Brisbane, Governor of N.S.W., 1821-1825.
Wentworth and Wardell were the only bar-
risters in Sydney then, and they took fre-
quent opportunities of pointing out the
deficiencies of Bannister. No doubt some
such criticism led to the bloodless duel with
Wardell, because next morning Bannister
threw up his brief and £l2OO and left for
the Cape of Good Hope. Eventually he went
to London and engaged in literary work.
Hugh Campbell, M.L.A. for Glenelg
(Vic.), led a heavyweight deputation up to
the Minister for Agriculture the other day,
and asked that part of the Victorian wheat
harvest should be loaded into oversea
steamers from the new Portland pier. Dele-
gates from 10 shires and four boroughs were
included in the assemblage, with one M.H.R.,
two M’s.L.C. and four M’s.L.A.; but the*
best Minister Hagelthorn could do was to
say that “it might be possible to get a
tramp steamer to load wheat at Portland.”
Pinned firmly down by Edward White,
M.L.C. for the Western Province, the writhing
Hagelthorn at length definitely promised one
tramp steamer, “if not more.” Allowing for
the difficulties in the way—and the first and
last of these seems to be the high freight-
rate, which makes shipping pirates inde-
pendent and haughty—it looks a pretty poor
attempt at carrying out the State Govern-
ment’s alleged policy of decentralisation.
The Peacock Government has begun to
economise by turning off the baby’s rations.
After having the nerve to squander £7oO on
the Parliamentary picnic to Gippsland, it
took Melbourne’s breath away by withdraw-
ing the yearly grant of £lOOO to the Lady
Talbot Institute, which is unable to continue
its charitable distribution of milk. _ Peacock
is a splendid sort of financial penitent.
This is the revised pledge now demanded of
its members by the Political Labor Council
in Vic.: “I hereby pledge myself to the
P.L.G. of Victoria to faithfully uphold to
the best of my ability its constitution and
platform, and to work and vote for the
selected candidate. I also affirm that I am
not a member of any other organisation
which selects or lends support to candidates
for public positions.” As the P.L.C.’s chief
business is, and always has been, the selec-
tion and support of candidates for public
positions, in order to push its own political
barrow, it seems a reasonable thing to seek
such an assurance from its members. The
game of running with the hare and hunting
with the hounds has frequently been played
by certain P.L.C. members of late years, and
the new pledge should help to abolish the
distracting practice.
“Pint Pot”: I am not one of the aged
and experienced red-tapists whom “Stenog”
entreats (B. 17/2/T6) to tell him why
typewriting is barred on birth registration
forms; but I can tell him that when
the typewriting machines first appeared
there was doubt as to how their
script would stand the test of time. The
permanent legibility of original documents
dealing with births, etc., is obviously all-
important ; and public departments in charge
of stich records rightly insisted on the use
of the long-proven pen and ink as against
a new-fangled invention which had still to
make good. Experience shows they were
right. It is not uncommon to find that type-
written documents of those days are now so
faded as to be barely (if at all) legible,
while manuscript of the same date is as
clear as when first written. As there is no
evidence thus far that the work of present-
day machines is any more permanent, Red
Tape shows an unusual streak of horse-sense
in continuing the embargo on the typewriter
for official forms.
“E.F.”: Announced that the policy of the
Vic. Railway Commissioners .as regards
casual German or Austrian employees is
that there should be no “victimisation.” Oh,
dear friends, let us avoid victimisation. Let
us not remove any casual German
or Austrian from their billets. “No
victimisation in national warfare!” It is
the creed of the big gun which smashes the
beleagured city and citizens; of the torpedo
that sinks the passenger ship; of the Zep-
pelin bomb that kills the British baby in its
bed but spares the Vic. Railway Commis-
sioner—for the present. No victimisation !
Chalk it on the wall of the German Club!
Write it on the back of the confiscated trade-
mark ! No victimisation. Let us be pre-
pared to suffer it ourselves, dear friends,
as often as the Germans can give
it to us. By the way, what is vic-
timisation? The family of five that got
wiped out by a Zeppelin bomb in Stafford-
shire the other w r eek might have explained
the signification of the term; but they are
silent on the subject.

“I am one of the old Freetraders. But after
what we have learnt of Germany’s war methods, for
me there is no more Freetrade with Germany.”

“Old George Reid seems to have just about
thrown all his principles overboard .”
"They’re not principles; they are worn-out
stock-in-trade.”
Premier Vaughan, of S.A., has been hav-
ing a look round Kangaroo Island, Austra-
lia’s biggest isle, which was settled before
Adelaide existed, but has more or less stood
still ever since. He told the residents that
their mostly-ironstone country does not seem
fitted for cereals; but every place seems to
be set down as “can’t grow wheat” at start-
ing, and certainly K.I. produces a lot of
barley already. Root crops and fruit do
well. “A million acres with a climate equal
to Tasmania” is the official claim, and
Vaughan does not see why a lot of returned
soldiers should not go on to it. Also the
isjand, which has several decent rivers, and
some of whose wildest countrv is set apart
as a reserve for the native beasts and birds
which the accursed fox is wiping out ou
the mainland, should he a great tourist
resort. Someday, when the mainland rail-
way creeps down as far as Cape .Tervois. and
the present eight hours’ voyage is cut down
to one hour, it may be.
London HeuaLß speaks of George Reid’s

DAVID AND GOLIATH.
Mrs. Edgeworth David presided at a large meetine
of the Women’s National Movement for Closin'* the
Liquor Bars at 6 p.m.— News item.
“Harrison O.”: As one who has voted the
Labor ticket for years I would admire to
know if the Australian Ministry has secretly
decided on a policy of “preference to
foreigners”? If not it is time O’Malley,
the serio-comic eagle from the Rocky Moun-
tains, was thrown down a steep place or
handed over to the public hairdresser. The
other day it transpired that two Australian
railway engineers are now in the U.S.A.
(the Mecca towards which O’Malley faces
when he kneels in prayer) on behalf of the
Commonwealth, studying “transportation
problems,” and, it is alleged, with authority
to enter into contracts for the supply of
cars. The latter allegation is formally-
denied by the water-lily from the Rockies,
but he admits that he intends im-
porting “sample cars” in connection with the
transcontinental railway. For about 40
years Australia, with railway workshops in
all the State capitals, has been turning out
rolling stock as good as —and in some in-
stances better than —any imported. Vic-
torian Railway Commissioner Jones says
that he has travelled over the principal rail-
ways of the world and has never seen any
cars to beat the best on the Victorian lines.
The Commissioners state definitely that
there is no kind of car which cannot be built
at the Newport workshops. And yet
O’Malley has the hide to remark: “It will
be necessary, when the Commonwealth sets
up its own workshops, that we should have
officers who understand rolling stock con-
struction.”
“W.A.R.”: At any moment now we may
hear of C. G. Wade following Carmichael’s
example and enlisting a battalion of Lib-
erals for the Front. Listen to the martial
ardor and noble patriotism of his latest
speech. It was delivered at the annual
meeting of t.he Darlinghurst Liberal Club.
“It behoved every true Liberal to be up
and doing, for a general advance by the Hun
would be upon them in less than 12 months.”
Sydney D.T., in reporting this speech, has
made some curious, but pardonable, mis-
prints. It terms the “general advance by
the ITun” a “general election.” “Darling-
hurst,” Wade continued, “was the only elec-
torate in the heart of the city that had
maintained the flag against the recent ad-
vance of Germany.” (Again, the D.T. ren-
ders Germany as “Socialism.”) “There
were a great many well-to-do people who
could give valuable assistance, if not by
membership, then by contributions, in the
matter of the War " Loan.” (The D.T.’s
account substitutes “propaganda work” for
War loan.) “After all, it was the electors
who suffered by the advance of the wild
schemes of Germany rather than the de-
feated soldier.” (Again there is the mis-
print of “Socialism” for Germany.) “Mr.
Wade appealed to them to increase the
enlisting by each one being responsible for
a new recruit.” (Substitute “club member-
ship” for enlisting, and you get the mangled
sense that the I).T. reads into this patriotic
exhortation.) “It would be a thousand
pities if the trench [no, the seat] was lost
by apathy. The outlook at present was
good. The victory .at Parramatta [evidently
a misprint for Lonesome Pine] indicated a
pronounced change in public opinion. _lt
was essential to obtain practical organisa-
tion, which meant votes at the ballot-box.
[Obviously Wade meant “men at the
Front.”)

A dragon with a thousand eyes
The city lies across the night;
I see its breath in smoke-clouds rise
And from it fire-trains take their flight.
Towards dark wharves that check the seas
Ship-shadows glide with gifts of coal,
And on the wings of ev’ry breeze
Are wafted sounds that sear the soul.
An unseen taxi hoots its pain,
And then no more is heard. A bell
Rings faintly once, and I am fain
To think the guests are eating well.
Familiar things take evil shapes,
And old, old noises make me jump.
(Since I have read of party drapes
The country bought, I’ve got the hump.)
A falling star but makes me think
Of taxis for the Premier’s wife;
Out of the blue I watch it blink,
Cutting star-traffic like a knife.
Perhaps we too will end like that—
One incandescent dash through space,
Shedding fierce auditors and fat,
And spilling bills about the place.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
Two of the results of last Saturday’s
racing at Caulfield were encouraging to the idea
that imported horses will Cut a foremost dash ir
several forthcoming events. Tullia (Bst.), the Eng
lish mare from Sydney, got away unexpectedly with
the Oakleigh Plate, in which Eurobin (9st. 111 b.)
took principal honors by running into fourth plac(
after being rather badly placed. • And Cyklon wor
the 9-furlongs St. George’s Stakes in commanding
style. Traquette, who made most of the running as
usual, may not have been at her very best, but ir
giving 51b. to the Victorian flier and beating hei
two furlongs from home the imported racer showed
himself in great nick, anyhow. Cyklon and Eurobir
will be backed to beat the unproven Redfern when
they meet, but if this other vaunted Britisher is
the gee that fancy paints him he should at least
capture the rich Futurity Stakes next Saturday.
Grand Fleet (late Klinger), the ex-hurdle
racer that Eric Connolly owns and trains, captured
the Bond Cup with a determined effort at the finish.
The performance will hardly shorten his previously
short price for the Australian Cup. A 71b. penalty
for this win brings Grand Fleet’s Cup weight up tc
Bst. 41b. He has a big back for carrying a moderate
burden, and he appears to be built for long journeys;
so if he goes on well in the meantime the ex-hurdler
must have a good chance on March 7.
* * * *
Every blindfolded punter in the country
ought to have backed Tullia for the Oakleigh Plate.
Brunton’s mare ran second to Athenic at Warwick
Farm, and then started second favorite for the Chal-
lenge Stakes at Randwick, and for five and a hali
furlongs shovved her heels to everything. Then she
collapsed. Since then she has had lots of work put
on to her. The Oakleigh Plate is five and a half fur-
longs. One lucky punter had a fiver on at starting
price—33 to I—and1 —and thought 5 to 1 would be a fair
thing. However, he transhipped nothing back to
Jerusalem. Sydney-owned horses have brought home
the Oakleigh money four years in succession. Meri-
mee is under the same roof as Tullia, and has the
Newmarket in view.
Among the war-loan investors was Ned
Moss ( £20,000), who made nearly all his pile on
the racecourse, and not as a Bar Von either. In his
early day's Moss sold racebooks for a living, and got
his start through backing a double. Many' men in
the betting game began with as little as nothing.
One big bookmaker used to get ss. a night for tak-
ing tickets at a boxing hall, and another used to be
a “runner” on the outer-outer in the old pony days.
The biggest of them all was a hairdresser in a town
further west than Sunset. And hundreds of others
have come from the broke stage to affluence. Yet
the game is no "ood. They say so, anyhow.

“Penciller”: Melbourne’s \x>lice are
doing their best to make a sti'angled industry of the
bobkmaking that goes on outside Jack ‘ Wren’s
Richmond (Vie.) racecourse, but the profits of the
traffic are such that it is not seriously impeded by
the fines imposed. Further, there is no beastly pride
about the kerbstone bookv, one man scorning not to
accept a bet of all even threepence on the favorite in
the Sisters’ Purse. The real settling-dav was at
Richmond Court on 14/2/’l6—St. Valentine’s morn-
ing—when three men were fined sutis aggregating
£9O for street betting at the benefit meeting for
charities on November 11. Last time there was a
similar field day, fines running into £lOO were im-
posed, but only £3 was recovered from the finees.
Oil the present occasion the highest bet noted by the
Spion Ivops, as Alf Vincent once called them, was
3s. on a 2 to 1 chance. Previously, when eggs were
Is. 6d. a dozen, a dairy produce-dealer who was pass-
ing the course in his cart pulled up and wagered
half a dozen of the wobblers that his fancy would

for-age race was then almost as safe for him as a

One well-known M.L. trainer of gee-gees
has a tale of long ago. He was then a lad in the
Harry Goodman, and once had to waste
slightly to ride. The morning of the race he was at
the right poundage, but mighty vacant, so Goodman
locked him in a room at the pub to make sure he
wouldn’t get to the dining-room before the race.
Biit, 10, when the kid was liberated he was heavier
than when he went in. Goodman always referred to
this case as a perfect mystery and proof that there
was a lot to learn about the formation of tissue.
J he boy never breathed that a housemaid had handed
an apple-pie through the window.

A sport went to the la§t Wellington
(M.L.) races and he coupled Panmure in a double
with a nag that was immediately scratched. Next he
coupled Panmure with every moke in the Chip except
Bee, which he considered didn’t have a dogV chance
Bee romped home in record time. He had been
given £ 1 by a girl to invest on Bee, and as he forgot
to carry out the commission, he had to hand the
maiden £lB out of his own pocket. After that he
decided to leave things alone, and retreated to the
grandstand, but had just reached the landing when
the grandstand collapsed, and Death just missed him
by a whisker. At latest advices he was talking
about taking shelter in khaki.

At a meeting at Karlsliorst in Germany
on the last Sunday in October £35,565 was rushed
through the tote in the day, which doesn’t look much
like general bankruptcy. Nineteen horses weeded out
of the Royal Graditz stud averaged' £127 apiece at
auction, while 24 rejects at Hoppegarten averaged
£lOl. At Vienna lately the biggest race was for
4160 sovs. War or no war, the gee-gee seems to be
going as usual in Germany and Austria save that
the animal is confined to fewer courses. Waiting for
these two countries to drop dead from exhaustion
seems likely to be a long business.
The surprise of the Hobart Cup meeting
was the hat-trick performed by Master Alwyne, a
five-year-old animal that had hitherto been consist-
ently arriving at the wrong end in poor company.
But in the three days of the meeting he started in
four races, and fled so rapidly round the course that
nothing could catch him over six furlongs, seven
furlongs or lj miles. And the stake-money accu-
mulated by all this hurry amounted to the stupendous
sum of if 220.
“Barcoo”: As a pilot of gee-gees this
sounds very near a record for Australia. Jimmy
Rogers, well known on metropolitan tracks, but now
riding in Central and Northern Queensland, rode
from June to December, 1915, 36 firsts, 33 seconds
and 20 thirds. There was something well-lined dur-
ing those six months for Rogers.
The most successful stallion during the
just-closed racing season in Austria was the English
nag Wool Winder, by Martagon, who, by the way,
is the father of Martian, the leading sire in Maori-
land. Wool Winder’s progeny accounted for 27 good
races in Franz Josefland during the season, which
were worth £13,500. Herr Mautner headed the list
of winning owners, his prads collecting £lB,OOO
during the season, but whether he got hard cash or
had to take the Kaiser’s lOU is not stated.
Les Darcy got among the heavies on
Saturday when he encountered Harold Hardwick at
Sydney Stadium. He also got one of his teeth
knocked out. Which is about all that happened,
except that in the seventh collision Harold was up-
ended three times in succession, whereupon his sec-
onds delivered the towel and the fray discontinued,
it is understood that Hardwick will now cut the
game and get back to being an accountant. He did
fairly well, financially, while scrapping, but never
ceased to be an amateur. He could not become a
hard-nailed pug. His bash was undermined bv affa-
bility.

The Ryans had a family gathering at
Melb. Stadium on Saturday night, when Tommy put
Dodger in his place at the ninth round. The occur-
rence was as exciting as a sewing-bee, Thomas per-
mitting the more excitable Ryan to do all the bul-
locking, while he held a right in waiting and brought
the distressing affair to an end with a hefty smite to
the jaw. It was a nicely-timed wallop and gave the
crowd a chance to get a drink before the pub closed.

At Brisbane on Saturday the Mick Iving-
“Red” Matson affair spread over 20 weary rounds,
and the referee said it was a draw. But earlier
than that the crowd reckoned it was about the limit.
The crowd was right.
FRANK THORN,
The Queensland pug who has been out after
championships for the last 50 years or so.
George Brown, the Greek, who came to
this country from Yankeeland with “Knock Out” as
an unchristian name, hasn’t done much in the knock-
out line. He spends much of his time in the ring
chewing gum and says “vow,” which is understood
to be the equivalent for “yes.” Also he doesn’t mind
whether his antagonist is black, white or brindle.
Neither does he care if he weighs a ton. When the
casual stranger was recently matched with Pat
Doran, the Melb. heavyweight, it was suggested to
K.O. that the descendant of Irish monarchy would be
two stone heavier. “What about it?” Brown was
asked. “D’you think you can beat him?” “Yow,”
said “Knock-Out” contentedly; and he may, too.

. ‘B-J.”: ‘‘Sardonyx’' (B. 10/2/’l6) speaks
ot old-time bare-knuckle scraps which “lafted some-
times three solid hours.” Well, a gloveless battle
between James Kelly and Jonathan Smith, held in
Melbourne in November, 1855, lasted six hours and
15 minutes!

‘Eryander”: About old-time pug “Ben-
B- 10/2/’l6). He was, as stated,
a Nottingham man named Thompson, with the scrip-
tural front-label of Abednego, shortened to “Bednego/’
and afterwards transposed into “Bendego.” He had
one brother a_ parson and another a manufacturer.
Both 1 egarded Bendy’s strenuous profession with
horror. Ben Caunt, whom Bendigo fought four
times, was also a Nottinghamer, and the hooligans
thereabouts had many a fierce scrimmage over the
respective merits of the two pugilists. Present
writer’s father was present, as a backer of Caunt, at
the last of the four fights referred to, which took
fJ , lace i n „ Bu . cks > ln 1845 > and was for the champion-
ship of England and £2OO a-side. There was a tre-
mendous row when the decision was given against
Cannt for going down without a blow; the very
thing his opponent had done at least a dozen times
m the course of the fight, which had by that time
i eached its 93rd round. Gaunt, a Hercules of 6ft
3in had been severely mauled but was still strong’
While the rowdy element rushed the ring Caunt’s
backers were talking pistol t 0 the referee —the cele-
brated “squire” Osbaldeston. But duelling had fallen
into discredit and there were no dead cats handy.

Arthur Mailey (Balmain) was under the
limelight in Sydney grade-cricket on Saturday by
tumbling down eight wickets for 98 runs against
Gordon. Mailey is the ablest “curly” bowler of the
season, and thus far has taken 69 wickets at an
average of 16.17. The only other trundler to acquire
50 scalps is C. V. Grimmett (Sydney)—ss at an
average of 17.92.

On Saturday last, at the Sydney Cricket
Ground a 14-year-qld prodigy named Noel Levy
scored 100 not out for Waverley 111. v. Randwick
11. Apart from the score itself the manner of the
making thereof was a revelation. There is no stroke
that this youngster cannot play, and the power he
imparts to each is astonishing. He also uses his
feet with the ability of a veteran. He is squat and
sturdy, and should develop into a great player.
Earlier in the present season young Levy scored a
century for Bondi School against Paddington School:
Another promising , 15-year-old lad otit Waverley
way is Stevens, who will take about 100 wickets in
grade-cricket this season. He took four for 44 for
Waverley first-grade club against North Sydney.

“First Slip”: Those English opinions of
Trumper’s batting (B. 10/2/’l6) were interesting.
This is what Sherwell, the S'Afriean wicketkeeper,
had to. say at the close of Trumper’s 214 in the
third test against his team: “Well, I have seen the
best the world can show.” Writing in an African
paper, Sherwell said: “His timing was such per-
fection that to bals pitched on his off stump I fre-
quently had the ‘How s’ of an appeal out of my
mouth only to hear the- click- of the ball as he
brought off that marvellous under-leg glance.”
-***-*
“F.S.”: About twins on record in
first-grade cricket (B. 3/2/’l6). Herewith my entry
of A. L. and F. Kenny, of South Melb. C. 0. A.L.
has represented lie., and plays regularly with the
first eleven. F. plays for the first, though more regu-
larly with the second. They are as alike as the off
and leg stumps—the same mannerisms, the same old
blue-serge suits and black hats, wet or fine. And what
The Bulletin suggests might happen with the
brothers Riley did actually happen with the Kennys.
While a S.M. eleven was playing against Clifton
Hill, A.L., who is the better batsman, having put
up his score towards wiping the opposite total off,
was sent in again with still 30 runs to get and two
wickets to fall. “Hey,” said the captain as Kenny
took block, “you’ve batted already.” “Oh, no,” said
Ken, “that was my brother.” “Fetch vour bro-
ther, then.” At the call Fred came out. “Well, I’m
hanged!” said the skipper. “It u>as this bloke, all
right—box on!” A.L. resumed his stand at the
wicket, and the score was promptly passed.

Jack Barrett, who died at Peak Hill
(W.A.) recently, toured with the 1890 Australian
XI —a team which included Murdoch, Turner, Ferris,
Blaekham, Lyons and Hugh Tremble—and in an
extremely moist season finished on the batting list
second to Murdoch with 1305 runs at an average of
25.51. Barrett’s stonewalling worried the English
trundlers; and when the second innings of the test
ended at Lord’s (in which he scored 67 out of 176
in 4hr. 40min. of weariness) there was applause
worth hearing. After that trip Barrett left cricket
and settled down to a doctor's busy life. He had
only reached the half-century when the Umpire
called.

In first-grade cricket over at Christchurch
(M.L.) the other day a team went to the sticks
requiring 171 to avert an innings defeat. One of
the first pair hurriedly biffed up 20, but the rest
of the calamitous team, including the reliable Extras,
could only collect six more. Their main explanation
was that R. Read insisted on getting seven sticks
for nine runs before they could dig themselves in.

A world’s swimming record was obliter-
ated in U.S.A. recently, when H. E. Vollmer of
Columbia ’Varsity, reduced the 150yds. record’ for
25ft. baths, by getting oyer the stretch in lmin.
29 4-ssec. Charles Daniels set up the previous
figures (lmin. 32 2-ssec.) in 1911. Australia’s long-
swimming stretches knock out any need of worrying
over Yank records in a dish scarcelv big enough to
drown a cat in.

Sydney’s Fanny Durack demonstrated that
she is still top in the feminine swimming world by
ripping through 220yds. of dampness in 2min. 53sec.
—3sec. inside the world’s record, thereby fulfilling-
prophecy made on this page (10/2/T6). Fanny
a!so won the 50yds. and 100yds. sprints. The grace-
ful Mina Wylie finished second on each occasion, and
found solace in winning the 100yds. breast-stroke
event, m which Fanny was not a starter.

The end of the second round in Sydney
baseball on Saturday left Waverley with a good lead
for the 1915-16 premiership. Waverley v. Leich-
hardt was the onslaught which stirred up the fans
and with scores “one all” at the ninth innings an
extra was ordered. On that, Waverley won bv
foul runs to one. The thrills of the game were the
pitching of Art McQueen (W.), who rendered 13
!w S ni’ n nf V V ' Balle - V (L.) with 11 assists. Another

“Nymsie”: The Ma State’s duck-slaugh-
tering _ season opened a fortnight earlier than the
Victorian shambles. Therefore, as the NSW law
permits unlimited killing and a Vic. statute limits
the bag to 10, a regiment of “sports” motored across
the trickle and in the swamps where the wildfowl
breed had a real gory time. A party of four from
the Northcote Gun Club, and a similar number from
Bacchus Marsh arrived at Thule from the scene
of assassination a week after the State Governor’s
party opened fire. They had accounted for ”1200 ”
ducks, mostly teal and wood-duck, after relieving
the monotony by slaughtering snakes. In Vic.
most of the birds shot were infested with large-sized
lice, but were in good condition. The 15-bird limit
is a farce. Parties pool their birds and lookers-on
share in the diversion. It is time the States fell
into line regarding conservation of native game,
with certain wide expanses of river and swamp
reserved as inviolable sanctuaries.
The bowls championship of South Aus-
tralia has been won by Clarence Moody, formerly
of Adelaide Register and foundation-editor of the
Mail. It was a popular win, for Moody— who hqs
just come back to the green after several seasons’
absence — was practically the introducer of the game
to the holy city.

Another good score was put up under bad
conditions at Rand wick last Saturday. Shooting at
900 and 1000 yards VV. A. Duly, allowing from “30
to 34 of wind,” scored 32 aiid 33—65 out of a
possible 70. Apart from the difficulty of holding a
rifle steady against such a breeze (and the least
movement of a rifle at 1000yds. is a miss), 34 of
wind at 1000yds. means pointing the weapon at a
spot about 29ft. from the object aimed at. In good
hduds the modern military rifle is a marvellously-
aecurate weapon. Pity Billjim does not get more
training in its use. Apropos of accurate shooting:
The. writer on the "morning of Lone Pine charge in
Gallipoli saw a lieutenant who was directing opera-
tions in an Australian trench put his hand on the top
bag of a parapet and say “I want the sandbags put
there.” A Turkish sniper immediately shot the
hand nearly off.

“C.” : Young Donald Fraser, a Double
Bay schoolboy and junior member of the East Syd-
ney Swimming Club, will be on top of the heap
before many years are past. Even now he is crawl-
stroking his way amongst the best that haven’t
shouldered a gun. His performances in the last few
weeks stamp him as a top-notcher. Short and
sturdy, 13 years old, game, possessing a natural
crawl stroke, he has all the essentials for the making
of a champion. His good heart was expressed by
himself recently. Said he, “When I’m racing and
I feel tired I know the others must be that way too.
So 1 just hang on and generally manage to beat the
other chap.” That’s the spirit of champions more
than anything else. Fraser is certainly the most
promising of all the boy swimmers in N, S. Wales.
And Ma will need somebody to take the place of
Longworth and Healy, both gone to the war.

“D.F.” : Premier Earle (Tas.) has got an
idea about financing returned soldiers who
want to go on the land. He suggests that
the Commonwealth or Imperial Govern-
ment should capitalise the pensions of those
men who have something in that form com-
ing to them, and that the lump sum thus
obtained should be put into improving the
farm and keeping the farmer going till he
can make his living off the soil. Earle
thinks the money might be paid over to the
State in which the soldier is going to settle,
and that the State could advance it as
required by the settler and pay him interest
on the rest. Where the Commonwealth is
going to get the money for the lump sums
Earle doesn’t say. The usual place
probably.

To those who are troubled with sore, tender,
aching, swollen, perspiring, unpleasant smelling
feet, bunions, corns or hard skin, “BIFF” will
bring quick relief and gladness to the feet. Use
“BIFF” today and banish all pain and discomfit.
By using “BIFF” once a week you will insure
your feet against all foot troubles. “BIFF” is a
scientific compound which draws out all poisonous
matter from the feet, which clog and choke pores
of the skin. One application of this unique com-
pound will render the feet sweet and antiseptic.
Its delightful results must be experienced to be
believed.
MRS. CARTER WRITES For years my feet
gave me much trouble. It was purgatory to
have to walk far, but after using one box of
“Biff” I can walk with perfect ease and com-
fort, there is nothing to compare with your
preparation for foot trouble.”
“Biff” can be obtained through all chemists and
stores ; if not in stock send direct to the manu-
facturers. Price Is. 6d. per box, or triple size box
4s. (triple box contains three t mes the Is.fid. size).

Lewis Waller in a will of 200 words dis-
posed of an estate valued at £5545. Probate
has been granted to bis brother Victor
Lewis. The estate is divided equally between
son Edmund and daughter Nancy, but Nancy
cannot draw her share until she is 21, unless
she should get married in the meantime. It
is a hundred to one that Nancy will put in a
claim two or three years before the time-
limit arrives. If she doesn’t, it won’t be
due to lack of offers to care for and cherish
lier.
Jimmy Glover, conductor at Drury
Lane, was again in his seat on Boxing Day
drawing out the music for “Puss iu Boots.”
James also talked a couple of columns about
his quarter-century’s association with the
theatre and its neighbor, Covent Garden.
One of his yarns: In the height of the
operatic season the prima donna for a certain
evening suddenly fell ill. It was Melba’s
night off. She had to be found to fill the
breach. Jimmy knew she was somewhere
on the river in a fashionable house-boat. But
there were scores of these boats, and he had
uo idea which of them was Melba’s. So he
cruised about among them shouting “Melba !”
“Melba!” When she heard him she replied
with a coo-ee, climbed into his canoe and
was paddled to the rescue. James says that
King Edward when Prince of Wales used
to go behind the scenes “to observe the
working of the comic effects at close quar-
ters.” Of course. What else was there to
observe at close quarters?
“Quidam’s” narrative:—
When the Crocodile diggings were booming
in the ’sixties, a theatrical actor-manager,
whose leading (and only) lady was his wife,
decided to try a season there. The goldfield
hall was built of calico, and the dressing-rooms were
very small, but Art, when stimulated by promise of
abundant shekels, despises such trivialities. The
hall was packed to the doors, and most of the super-
fluous population stood outside seeking for inter-
esting bits of shadow-work. All was going joyously
until, during a scene when the manager was doing
some hero business on the stage, while the heroine
slid into a change of costume in a dressing-room,
the lady happened to lean against the wall. With
pretty wit an outsider instantly jabbed a pin into
that part that bulged the wall the most, and with a
wild shriek and very little else the injured actress
bounded into the centre of the stage. When the
true cause of this indelicate and energetic action
on the part of his spouse had been conveyed to the
stricken hero, he dropped the curtain, and indicated
in vehement and eloquent language his opinion of
the nature of the savage of Crocodile. Old residents
aver that the melancholy incident concluded the first
and last theatrical venture on Crocodile in its
palmy days, but no member of the audience com-
plained of not having received his money’s worth.
Bland Holt’s old success, “The Derby
Winner,” has been embalmed in flicker in
Fogland and will probably be seen on the
screen in Australia. The lead is taken by
Eve Balfour, who hails from Christchurch
(M.L.). Her real name is Eva Hulstou,
and a few years back her dad had a small
draper’s shop in the Flat City. Eva, a
languid, willowy beauty, married an artist
named Balfour, who spent a few years in
Ghch doing portraits and figure studies.
Eight years ago Balfour took his wife to
The Smoke, and there she decided on the
stage. She got a start with Tree, worked
hard, and that, plus good looks, rushed her
along. In a short time she was playing
leads in Shakspeare, and made a hit as
Katherine in “The Taming of the Shrew.”
Recently she was handed the leading part
in a picture representation of “Three
Weeks,” and made a great success of it.
“Macko”: A one-act play, “War Mates,”
was recently produced at the Victoria
Palace, London. The author, Herbert de
Hamel, is a soldier and was in the famous
L< ndon-Scottish charge last year at Y.,res,
where he was badly wounded. “War Mates”
should be given a place on the programme c*
every theatre and music-hall in the Com-
monwealth. You get an idea of the tren-
chant dialogue and fine purpose from this
speech of a young V.C. to a striker: —
You have your strike. Stand up for your'rights!
Why, a two-days’ strike will only mean about 4000
of your mates following Tom and going under. Ain’t
this a free country? You ain’t bound to serve nor
work your damnedest unless you blamed well choose.
Hang the munitions! Hang your pals! Hang your
bloomin’ country! You stand up for your rights.
Don’t let any dirty non-union men come in and make
the shells that’ll save your sons’ lives. Your son is
being blown to ribbons —choked with gas—fried with
liquid fire—-tortured body and soul. But don’t you
do an hour’s overtime to help him until you have
squeezed the last penny out of your bosses. Stand up
for your freedom —till the Germans come and take it
from you. I’ve seen what they do to the villages
they’ve captured, and, by God, it’ll be a damned
sight worse if they get here!
“Harrison O.” : It is typical of the Yan-
kee playwright that if he brews a farce he
must empty in a pint or two of bathos. Wal-
lingford the crook, after getting rich quickly,
held high converse with a/detective anent
the joys of regeneration and the beauty of
domesticity, with special reference to the
cheild. “Broadway Jones” ended with the
ridiculous oration about the “Great White
Way,’* which is inhabited by sweet-faced
women with ’ard ’earts, and hard-faced men
as gentle as doves. Now we have “It Pays
to Advertise,” which makes a virtue of irre-
sponsibility, but has the usual two pints of
bathos. The young man who cheerfully pro-
motes a bogus company must towards the
end acquire unnecessary qualms and become
sorrowful at the thought of his wickedness;
his millionaire father, who has told the
youth that he must shift for himself, allows
the native hue of resolution to be sickbed
o’er with a pale cast of sentiment, and, find-
ing that blood is thicker than bishness, goes
about helping his offspring in an absurdly
surreptitious and expensive manner; and
even the brazen-faced, leather-lunged can-
vasser, who has started the young man on
the crooked path, grows maudlin and offers
in husky .tones to break with the lad and
let the dollars go if it will help to reconcile
pa and his boy. It seems to be a fixed idea
of the Yankee dramatist (and presumably
he has justification for the faith that is in
him) that it is not safe to offer even a farce
to the great neutral public unless it has a
suppressed sob lurking beneath its surface
frivolity.

Te P.: Not quite, though very close

Maph: “Visit” rather a joyous trifle. The nearest
you have got vet....H.: Never heard of the “mil-
lionaire in khaki” who told London Daily Mail
that he owns 250,000 acres in Australia... .P.P.8.:
The principles behind the wheat deals of 1914 and
’l5 are directly opposed to one another, and to
argue that both are right is absurd... .R.J.J.:
“Badges” decorate the tomb. .'. . 1.T.1i.: Better;
but a long way still to go. • Why adopt that high
immoral tone? Pleasure isn't vile.. . .8.C.T.G.:
Nothing to-day, thank you... .T.H.L.: Beware! We
put the office murderer on to people who write on
both sides of the paper. No story.... Liesurce:
And the “Lady of Understanding” answered with
pancakes in her voice: “Ain’t it beautiful the way
’e torks !”... .J. E. Lock: Poor stuff... .Snakes:
One stanza on the liquor problem:—
The gladdening cup makes some men kill their wives
And others still it causeth to be terse.
For it full many men have ruined their lives,
But thousands more it’s damned to write crook verse.
That explains a 10t... .T. 5.8.: N0....N0na: Cor-
rect and du11... .G.S.C.: Avaunt.... Rejected : It’s
rejected all right... .L.J.P.: Fancy talking to a
southerly buster in that mincing fashion!.... Belle-
rive: Like the verses on Florence Nightingale best:
Amidst shot and shell
In the Crimea campaign,
The martyr nurse would kneel
Among the wounded and slain,
Through the stillness of night
A vergil she’d keep,
O’er sufferer’s whom raved
In their fevered sleep.
Mained veteran’s brave
And lads weak and pale,
Were cheered neath the care
Of nurse nightingale.
. ...R.R.: Send the next attempt after you grow
up....W.T.: Don’t like the feeling of “steel-cladded
sealions.” We always drink “eopper-shodded sea-
horses”. .. .A.L.8.: And that was why Shakspeare
wrote “I’d rather be a cow and bay the m00n”....
J.W.: Drunk horse' as dull as ever. Can’t stand a
horse that rhymes goat with broke... .C. 8.5.: Too
slight. .. .Remah: Bright; but not up....C.M.:
Not well enough done. .. .R.J.A.: Very nearly....
E.M.J.: No, this lot isn’t wooden legged. It doesn’t
seem to have any legs at all. Suppose you were to
read a bit <sf decent verse somewhere just to see
how it’s constructed.... Saltbush Bill: Your inten-
tions are good, but 60 lines of alleged verse without
one stop is over the odds. .. . G.R.11.: Doesn’t get to
anything. .. .Z.1.P.: Cheerful pussy-cat patriotism
with no literary value.... Kurrawong: What is a
“requeem” and what do you feed it 0n?....T.C.:
“Our Selection” has fair spots, but not up....L.A.:
Not for g01d.... Chic: Good attempt; but goes
lame at the end. Try again.... Cocky: Cheerful;
but not up. .. .Election: No use for blank verse
sloppily handled.... G.K.: The old conventional
thing. .. .E.L.S.: The least entertaining twins we
ever slaughtered... .M.O’R.: A tragic subject handled
like a beefsteak pudding... .8.A.: If that is all
“Anzac” suggests to you, for Heaven’s sake write
about Woolloomooloo or Paris. ... Rally: “Bagman”
dreary business... .C.E.D.: Horrible verse. .. .Chick
(S.A.) : “Night” is excellent descriptive stuff. Tell
a yarn like that and it goes. .. .G.V.G.: Here’s the
gist of your story: A man said wav was right; two
men and a woman said war was wrong. The woman
ate an apple. .. . J.A.D.: Good yarn, but not suit-
able. .. .P.C.N.F.S.: Couldn’t bring you “pecuniary
coins” if you added all the rest of the alphabet to
ycur name. .. .C.F.: 579th contribution on “Spirit
of Anzac” rejected... .E.M.C.: Anaemic little first
attempt is neither blessed nor cursed. Don’t write
on both sides of the paper. Writing on both sides
of copy-paper to The Bulletin is as unprofitable as
writing on three sides of the paper. .. .M.8.P.: “Con-
fidence” not up ; but try again before you start the
worm diet. . . .H.F.: Doesn’t get there... .H.W-D.:
“Wiles of Wunkeyville” won’t do. Use fewer words
and don’t repeat any phrase you have ever read before.
V.F.K.: Where did you get the notion t’-at
verse doesn’t need to rhyme, scan or mean anv-
thing?. . . .J.B-M.: Poor verses with cori-s on their
feet... .8.E.N.: As first offender you are let off with-
a caution. .. .The Quince: The worst first attempt
we’ve met; and that’s saying something. .. .
H.A.G.R.: No. .. .Mugwump: Doubtless your inten-
tions are good, but you’re a very dull literary critic.

The Bar of New South Wales, following
the example of the Bar of Great Britain,
has decided against the manufacture of
more silk gowns (K.C’sj while the war
lasts. The Attorney-General is agreeable,
excepting that if a K.C. gets on the Bench,
is killed at the Front, or is otherwise posted
missing, a successor may be appointed.

Another historic old estate, Vine Lodge,
the home of the late F. A. Badgery at
Exeter (N.S.W.), goes to the auctioneer’s
hammer. James BadgeFy, the pioneer of
the family, had his first home at Badgery’s
Creek, at the head of South Creek, west of
Liverpool, and died there in 1821. His
eldest son Henry, aged 18, thrilled with the
glowing accounts poured into him by nearby
neighbor Dr. Throsby, who had just returned
with Hamilton Hume from an exploring expe-
dition through the Bong Bong and Argyle
country as far as Lake Bathurst, pushed
out and selected his home at Sutton Forest,
where he got a grant. He called his place
Exeter, because his father had come from
Exeter in Devonshire. Young Badgery
made his*property a wealth-producer, mar-
ried and fathered a dozen squatter sons.
He died at his old home in ISSI. Most of
his sons have since followed him into the
shades and the old estate will probably be
split up for closer settlement.

Plume Benzine
the most powerful Benzine on the market and
will drive your car up any grade.
Its specific gravity is only .715 An imperial gallon
weighs less than 7 lbs. 2k ozs., and, being light,
it is easily changed to vapour, and mixing readily
with the oxygen in the air forms a powerful
explosive mixture, which is quickly and easily
ignited by any kind of spark.
The magneto need not always give the hottest
and fattest spark, and as no liquid petrol gets to
the combustion chamber, the explosions are
regular and uniform, the engine powerful and
sweet-running, and, more important still, there
is less tendency to the formation of carbon.
Plume Benzine is the brand used by the motorist who knows—
A fuel that gives him easy starting; a sweet-running engine;
and more mileage to the gallon than other benzines.

Tn a roundabout way the reasons which
the Great Boulder Perseverance to
S development until the 1915 accounts
ar e made up are learned. They are low
‘ lue of ore broken and increase of working
\ ' arising out of the war.” As a London
■japer* points out, the Board’s decision is
d to understand, especially as during the
previous quarter over 00 per cent of the
, ■ was in ore approximately Ott. wide
dr 34? per ton. or 10s. better than
\ nd average vaiue of the ore reserves. More-
tel the general managers themselves state
that' development work carried on during the
quarter was attended with good results.
The Auckland district (M.L.) produced
£782 032 worth last year. £702,8.*0
( ‘oming from the Ohinemuri Held. Waihi
is still the most important mine, crushing
IT2 328 tons for £327,390. Waihi Grand

„nd Talisman Consolidated 30,230 tons for

Droduced £24,511, the most important return
being £10,311 from the New Sylvia.*
j yvhear Roberts on the luck of mining :
Kielsle fortune plays more fantastic tricks in
mining than in any other industry. In the diggings
■lavs it was a common occurrence for men to aban-
don shafts before bottoming, and for others to go
down and with a few strokes of the pick strike it
rich The frequency of this gave rise «to the Irish-
ism' “Never leave a hole until you’ve sunk it a
foot deeper.” There were instances of new-chums
handling gold, and, not knowing what it was,
rejecting it. These instances were much more
numerous than might he supposed, a* many a
puddling- machine man can testify.
I have a vivid recollection of a remarkable example
0 f . w hy the vividness of it should remain after
a lapse of nearly 50 years will be understood by all
gold-men when I state that the forerunner of it was
the panning-off of a dish of crushed cement for over
40oz. of gold. 1 was the “nipper” of a party
that was working in one of the table-hills on the
Loddon (Vic.). We were cutting up the cemented
bottom in worked-out ground. Results had not been
too good for some time, and the show was to be
abandoned. One of the pickmen struck a patch of
cement as black as jet, and a dishful of it was sent
out for the nipper to pound up. He soon realised
that he had something tougher than usual to deal
with, and when the men took a hand at the job and
found that they were trying to break up lumps of
gold-Mrom the size of walnuts to filberts —the yells
of joy might have been heard miles away. There
were not more than a couple of barrow-loads of this
stuff, but it yielded nearly £lOOO worth of gold.
It was seemingly an isolated patch of that sort of
cement, and it had been passed over by former
workers as worthless. All the gold was heavily
coated with manganese oxide.
One of the party remarked that in one of the
gutters in an adjoining hill, in which he had worked
in the earliest times, all the gold was coated like
that, and he suggested that the site of the first
waterhole where panning and cradling had been
carried on might be worth prospecting. It was
promptly tested, with the result that from about 50
loads of debris sent to the battery over £l2OO worth
of gold was won. There were nuggets up to 20oz.
flattened out under the stampers. Quicksilver was
not used in this mill, and I shall never forget the
enthusiasm of the men when the cleaning out of the
box was in progress as lump after lump of glisten-
ing gold was extracted. The sight of another rich
clean-up would be a more effective heart-stimulant
for me than a 30-gallon barrelful of liq. strych.,
digitalis and other drugs the doctors have been pour-
ing into me for a long time.
Misses in lode mining have been none the less
remarkable. Here are a couple of instances within
my own experience.
A few years since C. H. Kerry and myself owned
a lease at Yerranderie (N.S.W.), known as the Pyra-
mid. It was an end-on block to Bartlett’s, but did
not include the outcropping of the lode. We sank a
vertical shaft in the expectation of striking the lode
at about' 200 ft. We reached that depth, but without
meeting with the slightest indication of the prox-
imity of the lode. For its full depth the shaft was
in dense, jointless felsite. We made a proposal to
the owners of the outcrop block for an amalgama-
tion, with the intention to drive in their direction
from the bottom of our shaft, but we could not come
to terms. Then we decided to abandon the show,
and it was sold to Bartlett for less than the cost of
the plant. In a few weeks the extension of the level
from his mine revealed the fact that had we sunk
our shaft 13ft. more we should have hit the largest
and richest pipe of ore ever seen on the field.
An incident in connection with this mine reveals
the mysterious ways of the N. S. Wales Mines De-
partment. We asked that it should exercise its
powers under the law, and make an underground sur-
vey of the adjoining mine so as to determine the
general trend and dip of the lode. It was not with-
out some trouble that the survey was made. Natu-
rally, as this work was done at our request, we
thought that we should be supplied with the infor-
mation which it disclosed, or, at any rate, such of
it as was relevant to our block. But on making'
application for it we met with a point-blank refusal,
it being alleged that it was strictly private, or,
lather, “for the use of the Department only.” Of
'that earthly use it could be to the Department to
consign such plans to a secret pigeon-hole one can-
not imagine!
At Wyalong a syndicate with which I was associ-
ated had done a lot of prospecting in the hope of
finding a downward continuation of some of the rich
•uns of ore. To expedite the work we had an air-
compressing and rock-drilling plant installed. We
>ad driven over 80ft. on a pencil-streak joint which
was supposed to be the track of the lode, and as we
were then a long way past where we expected to get
or ®’ w as decided to discontinue the drive. The
or er to stop was given just before crib-time, when
'•ght holes had been drilled. It was thought that
1 would be a waste of good dynamite to charge
lem ‘ Had they been charged and fired that day
e s ‘ 10l, ld have seen the wedge-end of a block of
re which produced over £50,000 worth of gold. It
"as left to the luck of others to make the discovery.
The wiseacre after the event will declare “shock-
mgly bad judgntent.” Granting that that is a good
assumption, one may honestly add that it is devilish
had luck to have such faulty judgment.
Recent events on Ivalgoorlie Golden Mile
(YV.A.) show how worse than weak some
people with big jobs have been. Since the
beginning of the war labor unions and the
Ivalgoorlie press had persistently complained
of the employment of unnaturalised enemy
subjects on the mines. On a few occasions
a score or so of objectionables were interned,
and the statement was given out that no
more were left. One pressman who affirmed
the contrary was practically told he was a
house agent. Defence Minister Pearce when
appealed to made evasive answers. Then tAie
mine workers got to business in their own way.
They threatened to strike if a solitary for-
eigner turned up to toil without a naturali-
sation certificate in his hand. The result up
to last week was that over 200 enemies had
been put off the Mile alone. When affiliated
localities are dealt with the number will
probably be doubled. These enemy subjects
were not onlv unnaturalised, but arrogant as
well.
“Hamer”: Air. Justice Ferguson made the
proud boast the other day that every boy
whom the members of the N.S.W. Supreme
Court Bench had in their families fit and
eligible to go into the khaki ranks is there,
His own second son is about to leave.
Colonel Norman McLaurin was 12 months
in Ferguson s chambers; Major Jim McMan-
amey shared Ins chambers for many years ;
and Lieutenant Lawrence Street was his
Associate. These three the war has slain ;
and two more of his Honor Fergusons
Associates have moved on to the Front.
“R.R.”: Out of the dead lion cometh
li*mey (if the bees are stuck for a hiving
place), and out of the wowser cometh
reasonableness—neither dead lion nor wow-
ser consenting. Pubs were closed at 6 p in.
m k ydney for various reasons connected
with soldiers and immediately decent men
purchased bottled beer and drank the con-
tents m Hyde Park, Cook Park Domain and
other places of trees. This is the beginning
of open air and reasonable drinking of alco-
hoi which will kill the wowsers heart. By-
and-hye comes music and bright lights and
the drinking therewith of the wine and beer
oi low alcoholic strength which will brnfg
the Australian into line with his climate •
So the wowser has done a good thing, hut
he will die before he will admit it.
John Win thro p Ilackctt, who died in the
West a few days ago, was introduced to life
in 1848. Twenty-six years later he was
called to the Irish Bar, and in the following
year reached Sydney. As briefs did not
overwhelm him he did some leader writing
for the Hekat.d, but soon tired of it and
moved ou to Alelbourne, where he was vice-
warden and lecturer on constitutional law
and logic at Trinity College for six years,
Then he had to retire through standing for
a country seat in the Assembly in opposi-
tion to the wishes of some of the College
heads. In that election Hackett lost his
deposit. He put up a better tight a year or
two later at Sandridge, when John Madden
dished him by only a narrow majority,
Hackett reached the‘West in 1882, and after
failing at sheep farming owing to drought
he joined the late Thomas Cockburn Canjp-
bell in running the West Australian, then
a tri-weekly. The paper was issued daily from
1885, and two years later Hackett became
editor. When the State obtained constitu-
tional government he got a seat in the
Council and sat uninterruptedly until his
death.
Last week’s heat-wave in Adelaide 92,
95, 99, 102, 103 and 100 ou consecutive days
—enraged a hush-tire that closely threatened
the National Park. It was also touch-and-
go with Long Gully and Upper Sturt sta-
tions on the inter-State main line. This
was the chance of the soldiers in the camp
at Mitcham , Nvho we re right on the way to
the disturbance. To a call for volunteers all
handg responded. Commandant Sandford
hurried to the front with 400 men, and Camp-
Commandant Stuart took up another big
squad . That settled the trouble.
Bishop Gilbert White, who has moved
down frora North Queensland to the new
SA bighopr j c of Willochra, lost no time
in proving himse lf a practical Christian. He
invited 35 rainist ers of the district to come
and ta j k brings over, and actually got nine
Methodists> three Baptists and a Presby-
terian to n \ eet six of his o wn Anglicans. ”1
wiu not insult you ,” he told them, “by sup-
gi that the differences which separate
1 f rom t he Church of England are slight
* n over come. I value my own convic-
. * much to suppose that you attach a
j yalue to yours . U the difficulties in the
f * are as slight as we are
son * etimes told we should all be guilty of an
intolerable gin in raining apart.” At part-
ing the Bishop told them, “We have all
learned a great deal to-day.” Anyhow, they
had lunch together.
“Fort Scratchley”: The Commonwealth
having re-established the examination of
mas ters and mates at Newcastle, the Ala
, ancien t pilot steamer Ajax is running
. . , L . , , ,
. <,n the job. About a dozen pilo sta
ia turn to be examination officers, two at a
time. The work comes as a godmothei send
to the pilots, as, owing to ships not visiting
Newcastle frequently nowadays there is but
l l ttle piloting work available, lor this tvxtia
work the Commonwealth pays them,idOO
a year* Ihe anomaly about it is
that two of them, Barron and Y\ hiteman,
volunteered for active service as privates, and
were accepted at Gs. a day. lhe State pays
them the difference between their _ old
salary and the six shillings. So the position
boiled down is that pilots who stay at home
in secure jobs receive an extra £3OO a year ;
while those who are about to risk their
lives in the trenches receive nothing at all
in the shape of additional pay. This shows
what is sometimes possible in an intelligent
democracy.
SIX O’CLOCK.
THE UNKNOWN PATIENT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Within the heart of Jones is joy—
Although the Kaiser does not cease
The world with slaughter to annoy—
He reckons this a time of peace.
For now, when midnight sees him home,
His wife’s objections he can mock:
He was not on a beery roam—
The pubs are closed at six o'clock !
Now office cares can keep us late
And never cause a wifely sneer ;
All talk of bars is out of date—
Our sober honesty is clear!
From hard work homeward have we slunk;
And, if with some fatigue we rock,
It calls for sleep—we can’t be drunk—■
The pubs are closed at six o’clock 1
Let bottlemakers reign as kings
And levy tribute on each cup;
The order new an ally brings.
Our stock in truth is looking up ;
For we are stayed by accident,
An office call, or tramway block :
On sprees we could not well be bent—
The pubs are closed at six o'clock !
But Robinson has spoilt his game,
And wrecked his hopes by careless play,
Because the tale he tried to frame
The evidence put quite away.
He waved a bottle in his hand,
Last of the evening’s shining stock —-
“Not dhrunk,” he said, “you un’erstand,
Sh’ pubs all closhe at shix o’clock.”

holidays and health.
The object of a holiday is usually to gain
renewed energy for another year’s work. A
difficulty is that holidays are generally not
sufficiently long to accomplish their purpose.
Taded people go away for a fortnight when
tHev need a month or six weeks. Very
often a holiday becomes a round of sight-
seeing that is as wearying as work, and
the holiday-maker returns as unfit as when
he went away.
If possible the holiday should be started
in reasonable health, and if you are feeling
tired, weary and limp, as most people do in
our ’Australian summers when the blood
becomes thin and impoverished, you should
not wait for your holidays, but begin now
to build up your blood with a true tonic,
and so invigorate and refresh your system.
Nothing is more valuable for this purpose
than Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills. Over and
over again they have proved to be as good
as a holiday to jaded men and women. If
you cannot take a holiday, the value of Dr.
Williams’ Pink Pills is even greater, for
they make good the waste caused by illness
and the wear and tear of life. _ Any dealer
can supply you with Dr. Williams’ Pink
Pills.— Advt.
Constipation or Comfort ?
There can be neither comfort nor good
health where constipation exists. Most
people suffer from this cause at intervals;
many are chronic victims.
The mistake many people make in treat-
ing this complaint is in adhering to the old-
time nauseating doses of some powerful pur-
gative that leaves the condition worse than
before. In the new laxative, Pinkettes, is
presented a dainty sugar coated oval that
is free from unpleasant effects, does not up-
set the stomach nor gripe, but simply gives
nature the needed assistance. You can get
a free trial sample by mentioning The
Bulletin, and applying to the Dr. Williams’
Medicine Co, Sydney; or any dealer will
sell you a full-sized bottle for Is. — Advt,

IN BANANA LAND
“Mulga” : Twenty years back the number
of artesian bores in the Commonwealth was
very small. Now there are close on 2600,
with an estimated flow of 650,000,000 gal-
lons daily. Bananaland has the deepest
bore, the flow being struck at 5045 ft.; also
the shallowest (10ft.). At one bore the
traveller has the billy practically boiling for
him, the temperature being 208 degrees. The
coolest is 60 degrees. Two bores threw over
5,000,000 gallons daily on being first struck,
but were muzzled later and urged to be calm.
As a result of the recent perturbations in
sugar prices and the unfavorable conditions
for the old-time producers who still survive,
the sugar-land about Ingham, the Herbert
and the country north of Mackay generally
is passing rapidly into the hands of Greeks
and Italians. The old owners sell on long
terms, and the alien cultivators succeed by
toiling longer hours and putting up with
harder conditions. The plantations are
worked chiefly on the share system, so labor
troubles are unknown. If Antonio or
Demetrius employ a unionist they work be-
side him to make certain he carves out full
value for his log wages.
“McNorth”: I see it is proposed to set
aside certain areas of prickly-pear country
for the use of returned soldiers, no doubt as
a cheap means of expressing the country’s
gratitude for services rendered, and, at the
same time, doing something towards destroy-
ing the vegetable octopus. It seems a heart-
felt way of giving thanks, especially as
prickly-pear lands can be had almost for the
asking, and Billjim is likely to cast much
lurid language at the proposal. If the Gov-
ernment honestly wants to make a cocky
of the returned soldier what’s wrong with
introducing him to the Far North, where
there are no vegetable or other curses?—only
calm, blue seas, sunny skies, healthy climate,
fertile lands and everything else that is truly
Australian.
“Nemo”: Itev. Eugene Walsh, who was
boss at the R.C. Cathedral, Cairns (N.Q.),
for eight years, has had a good look round
before settling down as chief of his Order
in Kent (Eng.). He first w-ent to the
Philippine Islands, thence to Hong Kong,
Shanghai and Japan. From Yokohama he
shipped to America, and explored that
strange land before starting for Liverpool.
At Manchester Father Walsh discovered a
number of wounded soldiers from his Aus-
tralian parish, and great was the handshake
thereof.
“Dinkum” : Camped at the Warren, Mar-
rickville (N.S.W.), is the Queensland sec-
tion or the 3rd Field Artillery Brigade re-
inforcements. They are as fine a body of
men physically, mentally and morally as
any country could produce. Aud the finest
of them come from the plains and table-
lands of North Queensland. Anyone who
has been through that country knows these
men, but here they are brought right to the
doorstep of the bloated city sentiment and
its parrot cry about the impossibility of
developing a healthy race in Northern Aus-
tralia. Sydney should take this oppor-
tunity to see the men whose daily bread is
earned in the districts it regards as unfit
for white men. One of the Bananalanders
who provides a striking instance of how
white men cau work and thrive in the North
in Bombardier Donald Simpson, late mana-
ger of Bonnie Downs station, near Hugh-
enden. Simpson is a long, loose-limbed,
sun-hardened young Australian. A Southern
Queenslander born, he is a Northern man by
adoption, and he has worked on almost
every run of any size in the upper portion of
the State and in the allegedly unhealthy
Gulf country. This is his judgment: “I
would rather live in North Queensland than
anywhere else in the Commonwealth.”
PROOF POSITIVE.

notice ‘Beware of the dog’ a gag ?”
MATE (screwing himself round to show the tattered condition of his garments): “Does
that look like a gag!”

Anglicans are not going to let the pulpit
become a refuge for those afflicted with cold
feet. Archbishop Donaldson has announced
that for the remainder of the war he will
not accept any candidates for sky-pilotage
certificates unless they are guaranteed unfit
for military service. All the students at his
Gaiters’ training-college except four have
enlisted, and the college is being temporarily
closed down, the lonely four being sent to
the Anglican College at Brisbane Uni. under
Principal Bakei\ Meanwhile, Canon Mick-
lem, of the training-college, goes to England
to super-vise the publication of his Biblical
commentary, recently mentioned in The
Bulletin.
"Burcoo” jut a down the great natural
resources: —•
Every known mineral and metal exists in Banana-
land with the exception of radium—and even it may
be there, according to some of the metallurgists.
The range of precious stones is remarkable, appar-
ently the emerald being the only gem missing. At
the just-closed 'Frisco Exposition Bananaland’s show-
cases of precious stones and gems threw the experts
of all nations in the world into a state of frantic
excitement. Any American who knows gives Banana-
land the cake for producing some of the finest
woods in this universe, and Uncle Sam consistently
backs his opinion by importing Bananaland fancy
woods to make his most expensive inside furnishings
with. Enormous coal areas, sometimes 100 miles
square, and practically opening up on the surface
with 20ft. to 40ft. in the face, eclipse other known
fields. In centuries to come, at the rate the older
fuel-producing centres are petering out, the major
part of the world’s coal production will be from
hereabouts. Where one mountain of gold, silver and
copper exists, as at Mount Morgan, it’s logical to
expect there are others. Big lumps of iron are to
be found in many places, in some instances with the
coal on the surface. Sugar, beef, mutton, wheat,
barley—all can be grown to perfection, and Straw-
berry breaks all records.
And yet, unless the local Government _ can
cadge a million somewhere to provide jobs,
the blessed place reckons it will have to go
on two meals a day and see its boots perish
from senile decay.
The Senate of the University has always
been nominated by the Government;' but as
the institution has now 50 graduates the
hitherto-suspended constitution for seif-gov-

ate, though the Government will still be
represented by 10 nominees. The graduates

Iheir warden or president, and the senators
.will be elected in June.

Biusbank, February 19,
My Dear Thakoomindau, —
Brisbane hostesses have been eettino ,
their best china all this week to toaste2
Macalister, whose marriage to Claude Ww
son, a sprig of the squattocraey, w ill
place next week.
The small blind god was also responsible
for another gathering of the fashionable--
the wedding of Dr. Arthur Kelly, of StL
thorpe, to Miss Mary Pigott, one of ru
Toowoomba clan. The wedding was a pint
and blue affair, both in garments and decora
tions. Lieut. Charles Kelly, of the FlyW
Corps, came from Melbourne to see lht
medico brother through the ordeal.
Kollo Aytoun, son of a once leading mi];
tary satrap of Queensland, who was re
ported wounded and missing since Mons L
now' known to have died while a prisoner of
war in Germany. The news comes from
French nurse who only recently escaped
from the clutches of the Hun.
On Thursday night the committee of the
Queensland Soldiers’ Comforts Fund took
advantage of the moonlight and pay-day at
the camp to hold a corroboree on the river
As a result over £lOO was gathered in fr um
the sale of tickets, and another £l5 f rom
the sale of sweets. So Tommy Banana-
land in Egypt will get a few extra summer
luxuries.
Mrs. Campbell Riley and a hard-working
committee have started a Baby's Kit
Society. The affair got into working trim
only last Monday, but already 40 members
a fair stock of material and some cash have
been accumulated. Mrs. Pring Roberts is
chief cutter, Miss North is sec. and Miss
Bruce Nicol holds the funds.
Marjorie Brown, a Toowoomba girl, has
taken out a license to drive a taxi and has
already begun business. Taxi ladies will at
least have the advantage that no male cargo
will dare to argue over the fare.
The women’s Peace Army is making stren-
uous attempts to suppress the Australian-
produced Nurse Cavell picture, on the
grounds that it will stir up bitterness of
feeling. How these peace societies do love
to get into a scrap.
A new' musical society, the Brisbane
Operatic Players, is at present hard at work
rehearsing “Tambour Major,” under the
baton of Leonard Francis. It is to be pro-
duced in the winter.
The panto. “Dick Whittington” is with
us. A packed house each night learns that
its worst fears as regards the bare-legged
ballet are doomed to disappointment. Never-
theless, the booking continues good.
Yours affectionately,
AUSTRALIA JANE.
Some men can't live without a grievance.
The sanitary inspector of the Fitzroy Shire
lately complained that three Chinese had
dug out the remains of a defunct fellow-
countryman and removed them as passen-
gers’ luggage to Rockhampton. • The sani-
tary man’s grievance was that they had left
him the grave to fill up. Apparently he
expected them to cart away the grave as well
as its lodger.
“D.F.” : Officialdom favored the idea of a
parti-colored Australia almost as far back as
the first page of the history of this con-
tinent. In a letter to Lord Ilobart, dated
August 14, ISO 4, Governor King wrote: —
Respecting the first of those objects (i.e., the inter-
course with China) it would be attended with the
most desirable consequences in introducing Chinese
into these settlements, which from the knowledge
your Lordship has of the industrious character of that
people, and how much the Dutch settlements in
India have profited by their residence among them, I
presume might be attended with great advantage to
this country, were it only for the certainty of their
applying themselves to raising cotton for the China
market, which may be done a very few degrees to
the northward of this place.
“Itan” : The Crown law authorities hav-
ing had their attention called to the scan-
dalous stuffing of the Water Board roll
which has been going on for years unchecked,
find that the Government is powerless to
move except by an amendment of the Act.
On* the new roll there are no less
than 700 cases of duplicate enrolment, and
in one instance IS voters are enrolled on the
one qualification. The flaw in the Act
makes the compiler of the roll powerless
to the number of names which can be en-
rolled for any unregistered association. For
instance, every member of the Show Asso-
ciation, probably anything up to 1000, could
have been legally enrolled, and the Labor
crowd could also have enrolled every trades
unionist in Brisbane as partners in the
Trades Hall. It is all the more smellful
when it is realised that upon the roll thiS
year’s elections must be conducted. When
Parliament meets next they will make short
work of the scandal, but in the meantime
Labor is at a disadvantage in fighting the
four seats.
Mrs. P. King, of Waiuku (M.L.), who
claims she was born in Tasmania in 181 K
celebrated what she called her 100th birth-
day early in January, but, as is usual at
such cases, the necessary birth-certificate
was missing. What is certain is that she
was living iu the Bay of Islands with hei
husband when Heke took to the warpath ni
’45. Then she shifted to Auckland, ana
when war was over settled in Waiuku.
Even if the lady is not a centenarian she
has had some real adventures, and has one oi
two good yarns. One of them : In those ver)
early days her mother-in-law had only on
needle and one thimble. She also possesse
one turkey. While sewing in the garden s e
dropped the thimble, and the bird swallowe
it. The nearest shop that stocked thimhi
was at Sydney (N.S.W.), but to kill trw
turkey that was destined to be married an
become the mother of generations of turn
was unthinkable. So an operation was
cided upon, the turkey’s crop was careru .
opened, the thimble retrieved, and the wou
sewn up with the lonely -

in a cup of hot water has a natural affinity
for the hair and makes the most delightful
shampoo N imaginable. It leaves the hair
brilliant, soft and wavy, cleanses the scalp
completely, and greatly stimulates the hair
growth. The only drawback is that stallax
seems rather expensive. It comes to the
chemist only in sealed ilb. packages % which
retail at half-a-crown. However, as this is
sufficient for twenty-five or thirty shampoos,
it really works out very cheaply in the end.

A Wasted Night.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The spider moon across the sky
Had spun her cobwebs thin and fine
To catch my light-winged fancies shy
And smear them over with her shine;
The world was hushed, the night was gay,
A young breeze tossed the drowsy grass
That made complaining of his play,
Then turned and slept and let him pass.
The moon, the night, the wind, the sea,
The laughter of a careless throat
O’er shining waters borne to me
On all my waiting senses smote.
It was a yellow night for love,
A night to make all kisses fair.
With nose pressed close to nose above
The simple rapture two may share.
Oh. take the dull brown nights for beer
When stars are hid and waves are loud.
Then o’er your pewter you may hear
The mingled voices of the crowd.
But in the smooth, sweet time of spring.
When warmer dreams get in their work,
Let young romance have room to sing
And keep as sober as a Turk.
These things the spider moon approves,
The while on high she waits to snare
Each little mothlike dream that flits
In cobwebs bright as angels’ hair.
She lightly gilds her honey nights
And calls aloud that all may hear,
And young love, scorning her delights,
Of choice selects that hour for beer.
A night of nights was lost to bliss.
I waited long. He did not come.
Upon my lips the unspent kiss
Withered in silence and w T as dumb.
But well I know that if the rain
Had poured in torrents from the sky,
He had been making efforts vain
With one wet coat to keep two dry.
Ah. well-a-day! I cannot fan
My righteous anger hot too long.
These things but teach my life to scan
Like some well-labored stave of song.
For George is useful when we meet,
Ilis sins are never past repair,
The while he buys me things to eat
And on occasion pays my fare.

A Helping Hand for Party Government.
Dear Bulletin, —While a couple of excited
politicians were throwing verbal bricks at
each other lately one of them, who
happens to be N. S. AVales Attorney-Gen-
eral, complained that the other fellow had
not. when the cow cocky “was denounced”
as a child sweater, joined in the chorus.
Which suggests that the Government ought
to take drastic action. How about this:—
A BILL
To provide for the better government of the Ma
State in respect to affairs not covered by legislation ;
to extend the powers and functions of citizens, magis-
trates, police and members of Parliament; to estab-
lish a good defence against prosecution for riotous
language ; to give all dodgers, wirepullers and politi-
cal no-goods a fair go, and for purposes consequent
thereon and incidental thereto.
Be it enacted by the King’s Most Excellent
Majesty by and with the advice and consent of the
Legislative Council and Pledgislative Assembly of
N.S.W. in Parliament assembled and by the authority
of the same as follows:—
Division 1—Short Title.
1. This Act may be cited as the “Denouncing Act
1916.”
2. This Act shall, except as herein otherwise pro-
vided, commence and come into operation on the
first day of April one thousand, nine hundred and
sixteen.
3. This Act shall be divided into three part •: —
Part I.—Preliminary.
Part II. —Interpretation.
Part III. — Penalties.
and as many more old parts as may be added from
time to time by a Council of Jay Pees to be here-
inafter appointed.
Division 2 — Interpretation.
In this Act, unless inconsistent with the subject or
matter,
“Denounce” shall mean to curse in any language
of Europe or Asia, dead or alive, to stigmatise, decry,
libel, castigate with words, execrate, anathematise,
menace, abuse, bully, bluster, talk big, speak as a
German.
“Person” shall mean any individual, wowser,
woman, alderman or police constable.
“Thing” shall mean whatever is not a person or a
place.
“Place” shall mean whatever not being a thing
or a person as defined by 7654 decisions of his
Majesty’s courts, Judges, magistrates, Privy Coun-
cils, the Sunday Trading Act of Charles II. and
amendments thereof, but excluding every public high-
way, cart, box, gate, back fence, domesticated
animal, newspaper, pulpit, platform, chair, or any-
where or nowhere authorised not to be a place under
the aforesaid decisions.
Division 3 —Penalties.
Every person who after the passing of this Act
shall fail to denounce when his or her party leader
denounces shall be liable to a fine of £100, that is
to say, omits to denounce
Fat, bloat, Freetrade, Protection, the Liberal
party, the Labor party, the Red Feds, voluntary ser-
vice, conscription, loans, taxation, economy, waste,
amendment of the Constitution, saving, spending,
Ikey Mo, the climate, the States, the Commonwealth,
P. Enterprise, booze, the water-waggon, the railway
timetable, Cocky, motor-cars, the Censor, the neigh-
hoi's or any other item.
Every person who after a first offence shall be
guilty of again failing to denounce shall be adjudged
to have committed a breach of the War Precautions
Act, and be interned as a person assisting to em-
barrass Party Government.
A measure of this sort is urgently required,
anyhow, to give Party Government a longer
lease of life. At present its scope is too
limited. Under the Bill I have outlined it
could rage about 75 things all at ones, none
of which matter, and then knock off to
bellow over 76 more until somebody started
to yelp at something else, in the "midst of
everything that does matter could be for-
gotten except, of course, the pawnshop.—
Ycurs, etc.,

The happy child is always a healthy child but the health of
children depends greatly upon keeping their bowels regular and
their stomach in good order.
Seeming stupidity at lessons and many an exhibition of
temper can be traced to constipation, and anxious mothers often
call in the ' doctor only to find that the child has some simple
stomach trouble which could have been set right by Chamber-
lain’s Tablets.
Chamberlain’s Tablets quickly relieve disorders of the
stomach, indigestion, constipation or biliousness. The dose for
children from six to twelve years old is half a tablet.
If your child is bilious, its appetite poor, is fretful and
“nattering,” or restless in its sleep, all it needs is a dose of
Chamberlains Tablets

WHY NOT GET RID AND STAY RID
FOR. ALrL TIME OF YOUR TIRING,
DEBILITATING AND NOT BEAUTIFUL
EXCESS FAT?
EXCESS fat injures your health, impedes
your movements, and makes you the
butt of your unfeeling normal-weight
friends. People who are excessively
fat never feel well and vigorous like nor-
mal folk. People who have been fat and
are now reduced to normal think other fat
people ridiculous. Excess fat also impedes
the heart action, rendering its functions
difficult, and interferes with the breathing.
Not alone does excess fat injure your
health and endanger your existence; it
absolutely destroys your figure and makes
you a ludicrous sight. Why do you stay
fat?
“TI-SARKIN”
positively removes excess fat and will restore your fi gure to
decent and pleasing proportions; it is always a sure vmir
cure for obesity and corpulency. A few doses impro e y
breathing wonderfully, and the course of treatment cure y '
It is the only successful and, at the same time, harmless fat ‘ iec jr,
that has ever been discovered. Its efficacy has been undeni b y
demonstrated in thousands of successfully-treated cases, it
totally and absolutely non-poisonous, and can m no wise work any
injury to the general health, even though it often reduces excess
of weight by as much as a pound a day. On t:he contrary,
improved conditions in the general health become noticeable in less
than a week after its use is begun.
LET US PROVE ITS EFFICACY TO YOtT^
Watworth Co. Girilambone, N.S.W.
Dear Sirs,—l am quite satisfied with your wonderful treatment. It lias
made a new woman of me. I have lost weight wonderfully, and my breathing
is all right now. Since taking the Ti-Sarkin I can do my work without a
hit of trouble. I will never lose an opportunity to praise and tell everybody
that needs Ti-Sarkin about your marvellous treatment. V ours faithfully,
(Sgd.) Mrs. JOHNSON.
“TUSARKIN”
DOES NOT FAIL!
LET US PROVE IT.
Manager Watworth Co. Cuprona, Tas.
Dear Sir, —In replying to your kind inquiry
as to the permanency of my reduction from
the use of “Ti-Sarkin,” I am pleased to tell you
that the results are more satisfactory than I
ever anticipated they could possibly be. “Ti-
Sarkin” has produced a wonderful improve-
ment in my health and condition. When I
began its use I weighed 13 stone 31b„ and I
began to lose weight after the first few doses,
and continued rapidly until I was quite satis-
fied that I was thin enough, having lost a
stone a month. Before taking “Ti-Sarkin” my
work was always a burden, but since my re-
duction it is just the reverse, and now I am
able to take great pleasure and interest in all
about me. My friends all marvel at my rapid
loss of weight and vast improvement in my
general health. They say' they can scarcely
believe their eyes, and they as well as myself
feel very well pleased, and your methods
gained many warm advocates from the success
in my case.
I hope that many faltering women whose
excess weight is a burden to them will be
convinced by my experience, and my earnest
advice to all my' fat friends is to have a course
of “Ti-Sarkin.” Now I eat heartily' and enjoy
my food, and find no cause whatever for com-
plaint.
You are at liberty to make whatever use y ou
may choose of this letter. —Yours sincerely,
(5803) (Signed) Mrs. A. CARR,
BEAD THIS LETTER.
Manager Watvvorth Co. Sandgate, Q’ld.
Dear Sir, —When I wrote you in July last
my niece was rapidly improving under your
treatment. She was then over 15 stone in
weight, but has since been reduced to truly
genteel proportions, and is now a very pleas-
ing figure. She continued her usual diet while
under treatment, and was in no way incon-
venienced, and I am truly grateful to you for
the result, for, before the treatment, she was
absolutely devoid of any semblance of a figure,
a burden to herself and friends, and unhappy
generally. She has reduced considerably over
three stone, and her health lias improved to a
splendid extent.—Yours respectfully,
11. C RAH It.

Filling Up the Census Card.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
fTV IE - night is still young as father,
” clad in patriotic pyjamas, shuffles
through the door en route for the
bath. He is aweary and his corns call out
for soothing. Circumstance has enmeshed
him in the scorching labor of mending the
King’s highways. Uncongenial this, and
since bedaubing the pavement with the first
dollop of hot tar this morning a vision of
the cooling waters of the bath has hung,
mirage-like, ’twixt him and the shovel.
• Father was a blacksmith once, long since,
and when he ceased to use liis muscles and
sinews amidships, that portion, straining
now in the embrace of the Belgian stripes,
diverged far from the line of grace.
We, his family, are gathered in the dining-
room as he passes through. Amid a welter
of census cards we are proving by incredible
blundering how unequal is the contest be-
tween ourselves and the Government Stati-
stician ; for most of us are in the mellow
stage of life, and our green years were spent
in study of the Cow instead of the Book.
“Chaps in the office in town are wading
through ’em up to their armpits,” uncle is
saying as dad comes through. lie alludes
to Census returns. “Done yours yet,
Henry?” he asks.
“No !”| answers father. “Time enough—
got to the fifteenth.”
“Well, it’s the fourteenth now,” rejoins
uncle, always -glad to confound anyone.
“What date d’ you think it w r as?”
“Fourteenth!” ejaculates father. Then
in amazed unbelief: “Why, it wants a week
of it yet! Look y’ere? Toosday, nine,
ain’t it?” He waves the newspaper.
“Paper’s a week old,” answers uncle suc-
cinctly.
We would all like to laugh, but dare not.
“Never laugh at father’s mistake” is a
home-made axiom we learned at mother’s
knee. But uncle—who can escape at -will
—cares not. Says he: “You’ve been going
about with your eyes shut, old man. If I
hadn’t looked in to-night you'd have failed
in your duty and would have made yourself
liable—in law—to a penalty.” Uncle is
addicted to the remark legal.
No one heeds him save grandma, who
may be said to be age-proof against any
bore. Father, though, is a high explosive.
Impact with uncle causes an explosion at
any time.
He hurls the old newspaper into the grate.
“Well, I’m damned !” lie roars. “Never was
such a place as this ’cummalating old noos-
papers an’ to-day’s always loaned out to
somebody.” This at Mrs. Malone, in to
p borrow the scissors. He savagely forces his
’striped bulk into a chair. Mother, who has
been in training so long that she knows his
thoughts before he can think them, planks
before him two Census Cards. “I told you
this Jiad to be done a week ago—the day
you said / "had all your money.”
“An’ who a better right?” pines grandma,
her cap a-quiver at the recollection of yes-
terweek’s wrangle. “Is he wantin’ to give
it to some other person, M’ria?”
Father ignores the slur on his morality.
Grandma is a gnat, nipping but harmless.
But this Census Paper—now. when he had
planned surcease from pain for his corns!
Its perusal, added to uncle’s goadings, is the
last touch to his tribulation.
He strikes a clerkly attitude, or what
passes for such with us—shoulders hunched,
elbows out, jaw working. With fingers
stiffened by tar and shovelling he records
his name “Ilenery” (he has always spelled
it thus), glares angrily down the list of
inquiries, and acknowledges himself beaten
at the start. As a family we are not up
to normal as readers or politicians; there-
fore our idea of the Census and its object
is chaotic. But uncle is present.
“About the valuation now, Henry? What
d’you value this place at?” he asks."
“What do vou value it at, mother?” says
father promptly.
“I dunno,” she answers, trying to look in-
telligent.
(ir ;‘V ut a small price,” says Mrs. Malone.
“Thing is to make yourself dog poor in a
case like this. 'Less you own, less you pays.
See. Eh?” '* ■
Together our parents make an estimate.
We stand frankly declared paupers. But
uncle snorts scorn of this theory. “That’s
where you're wrong. You don’t read between
the I think (mind you I’m only sur-
misin ; I’m not in the Government’s.; confi-
dence), in case o’ propputy bein’ comman-
deered by th’ authorities fer th’ war fund —
I think it’s best to put a ’igh price on it.
Make it ’igli, ’igh. . . . Put it low if ye like.”
lie adds, surlily, “an’ let th’ authorities buy
from you at yer own price!”
Consternation ! Father starts to erase.
“What you got? £3OO. Not enough, not
enough! I should make it the five. Or,
better still, a thou. •Yes.!' put th’ house
down at a thou.”
“Oh, dammit, dammit, I carn’t alter it
a gen. I’ve made the two into a three, an’
if I alter, it agen the flamin’ thing’ll be in
a hole. There !. I knoo it would. Give me
a noo card, M’ria, an’ let me put down five
hundred”
“You offered five hundred for this place,
Af) r - a ’-2 a 1 no * letting Henry take it,
M na.” pipes gran. “You’ll never see such
a chance again. He won’t refuse it with
my consent.” She looks vindictively at the
penman. That weather-vane, the beaded
flower in her cap, begins to tremble, sure
sign of approaching tear-floods. “Not with
my consent, ’ she repeats impressively.
Father makes impatient sounds. It is no
matter. Grandma’s consent is not currency,
anyhow we do without it- quite commonly.
‘Wn’ this ’ere about dependents now?
Ow many ’ave I, ’sides you an’ the young-
sters? What about th’ ole lady?” He jerks
bjS ( thumb towards gran. “I keep ’er, don’t
Here grandma has a cloud-burst of thin
pbl tears, just as her cap had foretold.
‘ Here ’m I,” moans she, “seventy-seven
years old, and dependent. I got nothing,
no _ income, no stocking. This”—she
indicates a lean pocket—“is fer me
noo teeth. No property, nothin’ ’tall, an’
no ome but what’s begrudged me !”
Much time is lost in restoring gran’s self-
respect, and in dad’s refutation of the charge
ot brutality.
“Oh, or-right. or-right!” dad says. “It’s
always me! Sometimes I feel like —like
enlistin’, an’ what’d you do then?”
‘I think I could bear it,” answers mother
acidly,
“Ob, fer Gorsake lemme do this infernal
thing. How about occypation of employer?”
he appeals. “Now, ’ere’s me workin’ fer
the Council.”
<( ‘ good, steady job.” comments grandma.
‘I don’t see how you’d better it by taking
the shilling.”
Father grinds his teeth and takes strong
hold of his patience. “Do I put ’em down
singly an’ be name, or do I put ’em”-
“Collectively, Henry, collectively,” advises
uncle.
Father records it, dimly conscious the
while of an altercation between mother and
the younger set anent an unlatched gate
and the consequent fowl among the onions.
. Confused, worried with the urgency of
his task, writing, reading, tearing and
swearing, his mind seems incapable of direct-
ing his pen, as, when he would write
Henery” the word “fifty” appears as by
the black art. The pen, too, something of
a buck jumper, has a secret spite against
him, scattering blots on cards and company
alike. Tearing and casting forth, he is now
ankle deep in “throw-outs.” , „Census enve-
lopes curling in the heat of the fire
lick his bare insteps stealthily. He wipes
sweat from his face, and then, after havmg-
submitted the card to uncle’s inspection
tears it thrice, pitches it to the floor and
yells for more. See him then grovelling for
the remnants for copying purposes.
“Here is another aspect of war— what
alternative occupation could you undertake,
llenry, should occasion arise?” uncle asks'
•Blacksmithing? Horseshoeing for the
troops ?”
“No, no! I couldn’t do smithin’ agen.”
says father determinedly. "’Count <>’ me
corns, an’ me eyes—subjec’ to blight. ’Sides
which. I m hopin’ ter snap that bowlin’-
green job. It’s mine be rights o’ seniority
o service, an’ it was as good as in me anil
last year only fer that bit of a row with
Councillor Bills over the poundin’ of his
Ow was / to know th’ bally cows was
Dills s. It didn’t carry no card, nor yet
wear Bills’s fortygraph tied to its tail.”
'Course they said it was bad language lost
me th’ job, but I know ’twas th’ cow.”
Uncle considers this, but grandma, wak-
ing from a nap, is a positivist. “Civility
corsts nothing,” she mumbles. “That’s what
I’ve preached to my family. But some’ow
’Enery always knoo better.”
This is true. Humility was never father’s
weakness nor yet his strength. The sharp
answer which stirreth up wrath was ever
his. He states his general unfitness for any
service save that of nurse to a bowling green,
and uncle, the goad, beats him back to Coun-

.“But how’s Bills got all the say in the
job? He doesn’t own the Gardens, does
he?”
“No, but Goramighty, he thinks he does !
Y’ see his first wife ’ad money, an’ she pre-
sented a pagoda t’ th’ Council —had it built
in the Gardens at Bills’s expense, an’ this
pagoda”
“Perogola,” corrects mother.
“That’s wot I said, perrygolia.”
“Pelargoniums!” interrupts grandma
shrilly. “Well, that’s not much to give fer
charity. Pelargoniums grew like weeds up
’ome. You’d ha’ thought as she ’ad money
she’d ha’ made it roses, or camellias, or
orkids.”
Father’s old slippers rustle the throw-outs
in exasperation. . Nothing but the urgency
of his task keeps him in the vicinity of his
parent.
“What’s this now about firearms? What
can they want to know?”
“Fire-irons, ’Enery. Three sets —all solid
steel,” adds the old lady explanatorily. “I
had ’em when I first married yer father.”
The general oninion (unspoken) is that a
gag would meet grandma’s case, and
father, writing his answer, “No. I ain’t
got no gun,” adds gloomily. “Often, wish I
did ’ave.”
“And is the pergola still there ?” we ask.
“Yes! She’s there all right,” answers the
penman. “Y’ can sit under it any time, or
y’ could if th’ Council ’ud let yous. Y’ see,
they walled it in with a ’edge an’ attached it

“Drunk,” puts in mother, with a sigh and
a shake of the head.
“Yes.” admits the narrator, in a genial
glow of recollection, “I was lathered, an’
pretty mellow too; an’, just as ’e got near,
I mislaid a dollop o’ ’ot tar, an’ it caught

Before the pathetic beauty of this idyll we
sit in silence, broken presently by the en-
trance of Henry, junior.
"A hat you stewin’ over-there, Dad?” he
asks, with the easy familiarity so beautiful
to see in our family.
“Census.” growls the scribe. “On th’ last
lap, thank God! You go out an’ post it.

The room is empty when the first violence
of father s tornado has spent itself. Before
it the family has scattered like chaff before
Ihe wind. Grandma is wailing in her room
- had she possessed teeth she would have
been gnashing as well. Uncle is locking his
own front door on himself.
Father, reaching his goal, the bath, finds
that someone has pulled out the plug—conse-
quently the sound of water rushing at full
pressure on tin renders his maledictions
almost null and void. Now and then, as he
stumos about in his narrow confines, his
voice rises above the uproar. “Calls ’imself
a business man. Him? Th’ conceited liar!
Didn know th date no more than me.” He
alludes to uncle.

WEEROONA.
The Beginning of the Blowfly,
A TALE FROM GENESIS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IT was fifteen (15) minutes after the
Creation, which space of time is a
quarter of an hour.
Adam was scuffling around with a note-
book and a pencil taking down the names
of the animals.
lie took down the labyrinthodon paeliy-
nathus first, because that beast had an
appointment with a girl at the Tivoli and
wanted to get away.
All this was fifteen (lp) minutes after
the Creation, and the place was the Garden
of Eden, in Mesopotamia, where the Turks
are now (may ill-luck befall thefn!).
And when Adam had finished taking down
the name and visiting card of the laby-
rinthodon pachynathus he began to register
the other animals.
He made a note of the ichthyosaurus, and
the plesiosaurus, and the whale, and the
crocodile, and the sea-serpent, and the fox-
olofoden. and the eohippus, and the mam-
moth. and the dog that was ten feet high,
and the conger-eel, and the prawn, and the
elephant, and the kraken, and the woman,
and the cheese-mite
At least lie was just going to write down
the cheese-mite when something bit him on
the back.
In those days Adam wore no clothes, for
it was only fifteen (15) minutes after the
Creation.
And Adam, being so busy taking-down the
names of the animals in-his notebook, hadn't
been able to go to his tailor, or his hatter,
or his bootmaker, orchis haberdasher, or to
tin public-house where he bought his beer
by the keg. And he hadn’t even opened an
account with his fishmonger.
In fact, everything was just climbing out
of chaos, and paying 2d. in the £.
Adam, being bitten between the shoulders
as already mentioned, leaped three feet
(3ft.) in the air in Mesopotamia, beside the
Euphrates, fifteen (15) minutes after the
Creation, which was the first jump since the
world began, and lie shouted in Hebrew,
which was the first shout on record (though
many people have shouted three penn’orth
of beer since) : ‘‘Blow that fly.”
And the animal lias been called a blown,'
ever since. ,
Eve was also naked, though she hart
cabled to Baris for a new hat.
Eve lias been naked ever since, because
the Bank of Jerusalem refused to pay 11,11
cheque for the hat. , ,
Adam lias jumped ever since on geneia
principles, in Mesopotamia, beside tn
Euphrates. . .<■ b
And the reason of all these tilings is P f
comprehension.

HIGH day and holiday shoes, for wear on
extra-special occasions with the extra-
special gown, ought, one feels, to have
something distinctive about them, some-
thing that'lifts them above the shoes for every-
day wear and tear. It is this distinctive, this
different look, that makes the charm of the most
elegant shoes in the Bostock range, the delightful
little black satin shoe here illustrated, for ex-
ample. One has only to glance at the picture to see
that here is something very smart and desirable;
Then think of it on, showing daintily, captivat-
ingly, beneath the flounced or scalloped hem of
the summer gown. Nothing could be more appro-
priate or more charming. And with all its
daintiness and piquancy, it is the most comfortable
and well-fitting of shoes, as indeed are all those
short-fronted styles, and will suit most women,
giving that ease, lightness and coolness which the
Australian climate requires.

THE HERMIT.
[Fon The Bulletin.]
The house is lonely, and dull and drear, and filled
with a deadly gloom:
For all that is cheerful and bright and sweet it
would rival an ancient tomb.
In fact, I find that at night the ghosts of the whole
of the district’s dead
Arise and skirmish around and raise the hair on my
shrinking head ;
For whether you hold to agnostic views, or favor a
future state,
There are times at night in a lonely house when
you strangely miss a mate.
But though there is little to soothe by night, or
to charm the soul by day,
Just think of the things I have written about since
the wife and kids went away!
I have thrown my boots at the pirate fowls, the cups
at the sneaking cat
That thinks far more of a stolen chop than of cap-
turing mouse or rat;
And the half-grown chickens my wife adores—for
vice of a varied kind
The paragon pests that a harried man in the whole
wide world could find ;
They’re up on the table, or pecking the bread, or
hooking the butter or jam,
With an eye for the missiles I vainly send with
many a fervent damn.
What with poultry and pussy and general woe my
life is a sombre grey—•
But think of the things I have written about since
the wife and kids went away!
For whether it be that the brain works best when
the body feels down and out,
And genius fed on attractive fare is subject to men-
tal gout,
Or that dirt, discomfort and wrath give spur to the
powers of a jaded mind—
Whatever the cause of the wondrous thing, ’tis cer-
tain (at least I find)
That never in happier, full-fed days had I easier
work to hatch
Fine Jhoughts and phrases and splendid words than
now when I’m doomed to batch ;
And with pride that thrills, though I know the price
is a fearsome one to pay,
I think of the things I have written about since the
wife and kids went away.

There is to be placed a mural tablet to
the memory of Corporal (Rev.) R. H. Pit-
tendrigh in the Methodist Church Hall, Neu-
tral Bay, Sydney. “Bob” Pittendrigh trod
the Inky Way before he became a preacher,
lie served his apprenticeship as a comp, on
the Molong Argus with R. J. Baker, now of
Gosford Times, and with J. C. L. Fitzpat-
rick, M.L.A., who bought from Baker and
sold to the present proprietors. Corporal
Pittendrigh proved that he could use the
pen as well as the “stick,” but this talent
was not known until he got to the Front.
The tablet is not exclusively a Church affair
and friends wlm knew Bob in other trades
may cut in.

“Harrison O.”: My opinion that the
U.S.A. has, apart from Henry James, failed
to produce a really great novelist was worth
expressing if only for the unconsciously
humorous rejoinder it has called forth from
one “O’Phimerty” (B. 3/2/T6). “Has
‘Harrison O.’ never heard of George. W.
Cable, Joel Chandler Harris, Hopkinson
Smith and Edith Wharton?” asks this critic.
Not only have I heard of them, but being
acquainted with -the works of each I feel
impelled to remark that the man who can
see greatness therein is suffering from
arrested literary development. Cable, knows
the Southern States and the indigenous
nigger, and writes cleverly of them ; Harris s
nigger folk yarns were entertainingly done;
Edith Wharton affects the paraphernalia of
a literary Dreadnought, but her earnest,
somewhat stilted stories certainly cannot be
regarded as great; while Hopkinson Smith
is a Best Seller, or thereabouts, and would
doubtless rather remain so than become a
mere genius. In my turn I would ask
“O’Phimerty” if he has ever heard of Ana-
tole France, Gustave Flaubert, George Mere-
dith and Thomas Hardy? Let him compare
his quartette with mine and he may appre-
ciate the difference between literary great-
ness and talented mediocrity.

that 1468 working pressmen are on

been killed, 71 wounded, 11 reported miss-
ing, and 10 have been decorated for gallan-
try. Also, many women journalists are
serving as nurses.

The well-informed Dublin Freeman’s
gives the late Joe Winter, of Melb. Advo-
cate a testimonial that may keep him in
purgatory longer than he deserves. He was,
it explains, editor of the Argus, and through
the medium of his paper collected ±45,000
for the Irish party”—which looks like good
defamatory libel on both Joe and granny.

According to the Argus: “Barrier miners
boast that Broken Hill has sent 2500 men
to the Front. That is very creditable and
honorable —to the 2500 men. It is no proof
of anybody else’s patriotism. It is a curious
process of reasoning that which enables one
to assume credit for good deeds achieved by
others.” Barrier miners might remind the
Argus of this bit of cold logic when next
that paper is spluttering with enthusiasm
over the honor and glory shed upon the
aristocratic gloss of Britain by the appeai-
ance of a certain proportion of “titled
youths” in the firing-line.

Fed from birth on the 'Alletiburys' Foods.
Mother and Child.
Baby b% months.
Behalf of Baby
Naturally a Healthy Mother
should feed her own child, and no cause, save inability,
should prevent her doing so. But there are many
mothers who, though willing, cannot wholly or even
partially, nurse their children. Either they have no
milk for them, or it is poor in quality and deficient
in sustenance.
The Question then arises
what food should be given to Baby. Carefully consider
this highly important point. Remember, that the
right food, given at the proper age will lay a sure
foundation for future health and happiness. Ordinary
cow’s milk is totally unsuitable as a food for young
infants; it is acid, contains indigestible curd and is
frequently swarming with dangerous germs, especially
in summer time. FarinaceousFoodsmustnotbegiven,as
a child under seven months of age cannot digest starch.
A Satisfactory Solution
of the difficult problem of feeding children by hand is
provided by using the ‘Allenburys’ Foods. Prepared
as directed, these pure Foods closely resemble healthy
mother’s milk in composition, nutritive value and
digestibility. They are the outcome of prolonged
scientific investigation, carried out with all the resources
of wide manufacturing facilities and experience.
Decide to use
the ‘Allenburys’ Foods. By so doing the many serious
ailments which folllow the use of unsuitable food will
be avoided, and Baby will be equipped with sound
health and strength.

Backache! Why?
Do you rise in the morning with a groan? Do you feel that you are
getting old? Having made up your mind that you are a martyr, do you
vent your ill-humor on the family? After a while, the pain and stiffness
leave you, and you forget your troubles until the next morning, when
the same dull pain in the small of your back, the difficulty of bracing
your nerves, brings back all the dire forebodings of the day before.
This is the way Kidney Trouble creeps on its victim, and you are
starting on a long journey towards ill-health and infirmity. The
Kidneys are overtaxed with the work of cleansing out the impurities
from your blood. Each day there is an accumulation of waste which
must upset the body. It forms Uric Acid, and Uric Acid is the most
insidious form of poisoning that can take place in your body. The
number of ills to which it leads is almost limitless, and though middle
age is the most favorable season for their activity, even the yo.ungest
child often suffers, and sometimes dies from the different manifestations
of Kidney Trouble.
A change of diet is an advisable precaution, but a reliable, specially-
prepared remedy for Kidney Trouble, .such as Dr. Sheldon’s Gin Pills, is
the safeguard for your health. Dr. Sheldon’s Gin Pills stimulate your
sluggish kidneys to reaction, and assist the work of removing impurities
from your blood, which the kidneys have been unable to accomplish
unassisted. Then their tonic action so revives the kidneys that are
filtering the blood that the work is done automatically as by a perfect
machine. Your back straightens up, the pulling, dragging feeling
gradually leaves you ; in the morning you can leap from bed, feeling a
glow of health and vigor, and meet life with a smiling face. It is the
duty of every man, not only to himself, but to the world at large, to keep
his health in the proper condition for his daily task ; and for the victim
of Kidney Trouble Dr. Sheldon’s Gin Pills give just the little boost
his organs need to make them his slave, instead of his being a slave to
ill-health.
Gin Pills Will Help You.
If you suffer with Pains in your Back or Sides, or have any signs
of Kidney Trouble or Rheumatism, such as puffy swellings under the
eyes or in the feet or ankles ; if you are Nervous, Tired and Run Down,
or bothered with Urinary Disorders, Dr. Sheldon’s Gin Pills for Backache
and Kidney Trouble are the Remedy which will quickly relieve you of
your misery. You can secure an original bottle of Dr. Sheldon’s Gin
Pills for Backache and Kidney Troubles from all Chemists and Store-
keepers for 1/6; or, in larger bottles, holding more than twice the
quantity, for 2/6 ; or, if not obtainable locally, will be sent post free on
receipt of price in postal notes or stamps by the

The Man with the Silver Head;
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
-CXTALTER ROSSITTER and his friend
VV Judson rode at the long, easy can-
’ T ter which saves the horse and eats
the miles. They were out of Walter Rossi t-
ter’s towri; his country of Mt. Remarkable
is 400 miles or so south-west. Rossitter
looked with interest at the new world of
great cave-pierced limestone rocks, blackened
by exposure and weathered into turrets and
pinnacles. It was newer to Judson; the
red earth, the black limestone —high and of
interminable length—the great bottle-green
figtrees, each with its colony of cooing
pigeons and each marking the entrance to a
cave. Down that cave felt and faltered the
hundreds of feet of the fig-roots, dropping
a sentient feeler over every shelf and stalac-
tite and searching for water in the dark.
The sunlight lay upon the maze of lime-
stone hills; heavy yellow in the half-
shadows and white as arclights on the
summits. The day was blue, gold and mag-
nolia-green. Along the red track between
the hills ot lime a big chestnut cantered
lightly to the weight of a small blackboy,
his only garment a man’s waistcoat, worn
upside down and buttoned up the back. The
small boy’s legs were through the armholes
and the waistcoat covered all of him but
essentials.
“Who’s the kid, Wally?” asked Judson, as
they cantered lightly along the red track to
Girofla.
“I don’t know his real name. lie belongs
to Manson, and Manson calls him Cock-
roach.”
“And who’s Manson?”
“A fine chap—we’ll meet him at Station
Creek, most likely. lie owns a lot of coun-
try round here and a station on the Einas-
leigh, too.”
They cantered into Station Creek at near
enough to lunch-time, and Manson joined
them before the tea had stewed to undrink-
ableness. He was a tall, spare, fair-bearded
man, apparently beloved of the blackboy,
whose lustrous eyes sought Manson’s face
with all the unquestioning fidelity of a dog.
Manson spoke little. Also, although the
day was hot and they lunched in the shade
of a great rock, so that Rossitter and Jud-
son bad doffed their hats, Manson sat with
his hat on and seemed shy in the presence
of the stranger, Judson. After lunch he
said he had business at the homestead a
mile or two away, and that his boy Cock-
roach would go on with Rossitter and Jud-
son to Girofla. It was a long speech for
him, and. immediately after delivering it, he
sent Cockroach to resacldle his horse. When
it was led up to him he threw a very long
leg over the saddle and rode away as if
horse and man were Centaur.
“Good cut of a man that, Wally!” said
Judson. “He’ll never be prosecuted for talk-
ing out of his turn. But does he live in that
hat? It seemed as much a part of him as
he is of that big grey gelding.”
“lie doesn’t take that hat off because he’s
sensitive about the injury to his head. He’s
got a silver plate in it as big as the palm of
my hand.”
“What’s the yarn?”
“He told me ; but we’re old friends. He’ll
never tell you, Juddy ; so I will. It’s only
about Manson and four hundred head of
cattle , and Arunga—a black he had as
drover’s boy. Arunga was Cockroach’s
father.”
“Was?”
‘‘Yes— he’s outski now.”
-Ynd then Walter Rossitter told Judson
me story of Manson, the Man with the
mlver Head, and of Arunga, the father of
ockroach, who wore only a man’s waist-
coat, upside down and buttoned up the back.
Manson, with 400 mixed cattle from his
.le station on the Einasleigh, fared slowly,
1? the heavy rains of the monsoon, through
if glue of the black soil between Quartz
■U and Fossilbrook. The rain fell for ever
na ever; patient, persistent, inevitable;
)e , eB.ttle, slowed down by good condition,
by the track and the moist
?t’ floundered through the black soil at a
rb 11 °t a mile an hour or thereabout. Man-
v “ rode sitting down in the saddle, as if the
f avy F ai r> had sunk him. Rain dripped
om his hat-brim, from his glistening oil-
in' in fl coat ’ Horn his well-washed boots, from
W tla jFV'. a, the reins, and from every
Wofi 0t J l 's.Pointed beard. Arunga, a sullen
cack of middle age, rode on the right wing
t ‘, morose man, hating the madness of
sn'aYi * n the rain, hunched upon the
of ti • Rlea t toes gripping the inner bars
rn ' e stir nip-irons as ’possums grip boughs.
n , Packhorses fed at- intervals until the
of i as a head ; and then, as if afraid
YJm ln ?u Manson ’ they trotted up to the mob
the cam P gear swaying and rattling
00 . y came - The dogs looked up at these
iiritnt' !ia u returns to excitement; but the
eat and moisture had left them
i, ‘• '. ,t one of them heeled the pack-
s in Play- At four o’clock in the after-
noon-—which might have been eleven in the
morning, or six in the evening, for any nota-
ble alteration in temperature or outlook —
Manson, with a wave of the hand, motioned
Arunga to steady the mob on a long, grassy
flat by a sandy creek fringed with pandanus,
and bearing in its channel two feet of sap-
green water. lie dismounted, caught tlie
pack-horses, rigged the tent-fly, and made
camp.
They had finished eating before the swift
night closed on them ; Arunga sitting at the
other extreme of the tent-fly, the ten feet of
distance representing the difference of caste.
A blue dog lay near Manson, gnawing at a
beef sinew as tough as hide; and a black
dog stood in the rain, his mouth leaking for
scraps; his tail describing its movements of
ingratiation and his anticipatory eyes
hungry for provender and recognition.
Manson lighted his pipe, and Arunga fol-
lowed the lead ; and Manson instructed him
with native brevity in the work of the night.
Arunga had never before been on the track
with cattle ; and his hatred of the new and
uncomfortable conditions of work in the rain
and the darkness increased his moroseness.
He dangerously approached insolence —more
of manner than of word.
“Arunga,” said Manson, “you watch good-
feller first time. Byem-bye I been wake;
then you been sleep. Rain stop little feller
time. S’pose big feller thunder, lightning
he come, altogether cattle been frightened.
You gettem alonga horse, been ridem round
that one ; watchem big roan piker; watchem
black bullock; watchem big feller straw-
berry—then him been all right.”
“1 been wantem ’trorberry jam,” said
Arunga, sullenly, his greedy eyes turned to
the paclc-bag.
“S’pose good feller, you gettem t’-mor-
row,” replied Manson so definitely that he
closed the argument. “Now! You gettem
horse —ride round that one, s’posbn he been
frightened.”
The sulky Arunga withdrew from the
little fire he had made to squat over.. It
sputtered no longer, for the rain had mirac-
ulously ceased, and a heavy, thick, moist and
breathless air replaced it, sinking on the
men like the tangible darkness of a tomb,
oppressing their lungs, so that they breathed
like men in the stress of wrestling or fight.
The air grew thicker, and painful as its
electrical saturations proceeded. A sinister
intelligence seemed to dominate the. dark-
ness ; the cattle moved uneasily, as if they
felt the presence of death among them —the
suggestion of spilled blood, full of terror to
these grass-eaters of the plains. Habit
made these phenomena familiar to Manson.
Lving comfortably on his nap under the
tent-fly, he put his pipe away and slept like
a tired child.
The gloomy Arunga, with the dogs follow-
ing—brave and willing as the man was not,
for training had made them single-hearted
to duty—-rode around the cattle. They moved
without aim or direction, uneasy in. the
electric air, smelling the thunderbolts in it
and feeling that for them it was charged
with doom. Arunga tried to forget his
fears of the darkness —not the fear of a
coward, but the transmitted horror of the
unseen, brought to him through a hundred
generations who had shivered at their devils
of the darkness and strengthened by super-
stition, for ever expanding and concrescent.
A sigh came over the plain. It was but a
variation of temperature; but Arunga
thought it the breathing of a devil, and
shivered. The air trembled as if itself were
afraid. Arunga’s heart came to his throat,
and his throat rose into his mouth; every
hair of him stood up in fear: his flesh trem-
bled in the cold sweat that broke upon his
skin. The fear of man and cattle extended
itself to the horse —he, too, trembled as he
padded around the unquiet herd. Only the
dogs—one ahead and one following—went to
duty steadfastly, although the younger dog
once whined his disbelief in the wholesome-
ness of things.
A great black shape suddenly lifted itself
at the offside of Arunga and the horse put
both forefeet rigidly before him, and sat
back upon his quarters, snorting his fear.
The black shape swerved away from them,
in a fear greater than that of the horse
Other shapes arose and began to call to each
other —not the contented cry of cattle in
safe pasture, but muttering bellow r s to tell
each other of danger and the menace of the
night. It completed the fears of Arunga.
He rode around the mob, looking behind
him for terror and ahead for devils; trying
to look all ways at once. He circled the
cattle and returned to the camp, feeling that
he must have the presence of the white man.
To be nearer Manson he dismounted; and,
sitting with his back against a tree, held
the horse by the bridle-rein and listened to
the cattle settling down —not as if reassured,
but in despair and resignation. Then Arunga
promptly fell asleep.
The old dog went half-way on the right
flank of the mob and then, discovering that
he had no man to direct him, returned to the
younger dog by the tent-fly, lay down with
his head between his paws and dozed.
A wind arose and blew in gusts and died
again. The air became moister and heavier
—as if it were laden, not with rain, but
mercury. There was a distant flash of light-
ning—a crepitation as of fire among dry
sticks and then a few great drops of rain fell.
The cattle were uneasy again. The white
man slept quietly; Arunga was dead to the
world. Suddenly the night was split in a
hundred lines as a window broken by a
stone. The terrified cattle were shown a
world of madness, lighted by the horror of
blue flame; a tremendous concussion shook
the firmament; the darkness was torn again
by lightning and the rain fell in torrents.
Then the stags of the herd—the big roan
piker and the black bullock and the big
strawberry—expressed all the madness of the
mob. With tails aloft and heads down, they
rushed through the lightning-broken night,
crashing into trees as if possessed of devils.
Manson awoke to the deluge, to lightning
so frequent and intimate that it was as if a
thousands hands in the darkness offered him
lightning-flashes at the length of walking-
sticks, to thunder so high that it seemed as
if a million drapers were tearing calico at
his ears. A great lightning flash showed
him the flat bare of cattle and Arunga still
asleep, though his horse had pulled away at
the alarm of the cattle. Between the thun-

a
CUT HIS HAND
WHILE SAWING.
“While sawing my hus-
band inflicted a nasty
wound in his left hand
with the saw,” says Mrs.
F. Reid, of Fleet Street, Devon-
port, N.Z. “The wound in-
flamed and festered up, and
stubbornly refused to heal,
notwithstanding the various
remedies and treatments we
tried.
INSEPARABLE from the rough, tearing wort
1 of the workshop, railroad, farm or cattle
station are those every-day cuts and bruise
which may be neglected once too often. Zam
Buk has brought to the worker new possibilities
in “first aid.” Clean the skin round the wound
or cut, and promptly dress the injury with Zarn
Buk. Zain-Buk does more than allay pain and
inflammation; it prevents festering and blood
poisoning, and heals up your hurt quickly and
perfectly. Zam-Buk is wholesome, and contains
none of the rancid animal fats that make old
fashioned ointments so risky and useless. When
you cut or scratch yourself the best thin** to do
is to apply Zam-Buk, the powerful antiseptic
and healer.
FLYING CHIP CAUSES PAINFUL WOUND.
AS among the tree-fellers and timber-getters, so
in your backyard, chopping wood is not free
from danger. This is illustrated in the case of
Mr. Daniel Connell, of Hollingshead Street, Botany
Sydney, who says: “While chopping wood a flying
chip struck me on the leg, causing a nasty wound
The part became swollen and very inflamed and pain-
ful, and looked so bad that I feared blood-poison
would set in. For seven weeks I w r as laid up with mv
leg, and all the treatments I applied to the wound
were useless. Finally I happened to come across
Zam-Buk, and applied a dressing of this splendid
balm. The first application gave great relief—stopped
the swelling, allayed all the inflammation and eased
the pain. Continuing with the treatment of Zam-Buk,
in a surprisingly short time my leg was completely
healed.”
“At length we happened across Zam-Buk, and were so encouraged with the marvellous benefits
derived from the first applications that we continued to apply this excellent balm. Zam-Buk drew!
all the had matter out of the sore, allayedall inflammation, finally healing up the place \\lkh clean,
healthy skin.”

ders Manson heard the crashing of the last
nf the mob through the trees of the plain.
Then he understood. The loss of the work
of a year out-stared and maddened him. He
went to Arunga and kicked that morose
shirker’s buttocks. Arunga awoke.
“I been tellem you keep watch—watchem
alonga. big roan piker, big feller black bul-
lock, big strawberry. Where all that one?”
“All that one,” replied Arunga—sulkily
but with absolute fidelity to facts —“all that
one been go all about.”
“By God! I give you all about,” said
Manson.
lie tore a stirrup-leather from his saddle,
and, holding the'iron, he beat Arunga with
the leather until rage left him. Then, throw-
ing down the leather and iron, the philoso-
phy of the bush, and his learning in the
University of Hard Places, came to help.
_ “No good till daybreak,” said Manson to
himself. “When there’s nothing else to do,
go to sleep.”
He lay back on his blankets and was soon
lost again to all that Hell of light and noise.
Arunga lay nursing his stripes, until he
heard Manson’s measured breathing. Then
he approached cautiously, though mad with
the lust to hurt. His eye-white flashed in
the lightning as he leaned over the sleeper;
and then, taking up the stirrup-iron by the
leather, he struck murderously at the top of
Manson’s head with the iron. Thrice he
struck and was answered by one groan.
Then came silence.
Arunga knew that he must take to the
bush and quickly ; and he was, furthermore,
afraid to stay with the dead man. Yet greed
delayed him. He lighted a fire under the
tent-fly, opened the pack-bags and took from
them all his soul had lusted for —the straw-
berry jam, a tin of kippered herring, a wedge
of cheese, biscuits and tobacco. It was not
blackfellow’s tobacco, the black sheep-wash
running 26 sticks to the pound, but the white
man’s tobacco—broad plugs of it, dark brown
and faded yellow. He took also a red ban-
dana neckerchief which he had desired for
these three days, and in it he wrapped his
spoil. Then he sighed relief and satisfaction
—and looked up.
By the firelight he saw a terrible Tiling
facing him—something blood-covered, in-
human, but indomitable to the death —Man-
son broken and frightfully injured, but
armed and ready. Arunga had scarcely a
moment to feel the paralysis of fear when
the revolver cracked, and he met Dead Finish.
The slayer fell forward fainting, but re-
covered himself. And then the unbeatable in
man began to do the impossible. His skull
had been broken by Arunga, but, half-con-
seiously, he felt thankful that the bone was
not pressing on the brain. He held his head
in both hands and tried to think. Then,
groaning, he crawled to the _pack-bag, took
out a towel and the bag of flour. He made a
thin paste of the flour and- the rain, soaked
the towel in it and wrapped the towel
around his head.
* * * *
“That’s the spirit,” said Judson. “Fine!
What endurance ! And then, I suppose, he
sat down and waited for somebody to come
up the track?”
“Not on your life, he didn’t!” replied
Walter Rossitter. “He crawled around till
he found his horse; and he rode a hundred
miles to hospital.”
“Incredible !”
“He did! The flour poultice kept him'
clear of losing any more blood; but I’m told
they had a terrible time cutting the towel off
in the hospital. It was baked hard by the
sun. They lifted the bones, and then found
they had to put a plate into the skull.”
“I see! The man with the silver head.
He’s a wonder.”
“The bush made him.”
“And that kid ahead is Arunga’s son?
Well, well! But he seems to worship Man-
son.” •
“He does! Let’s ask him about his father.”
They cantered to the little blackboy ahead.
He looked up at them and grinned.
“Cockroach,” said Walter Rossitter, “you
been likem Misser Manson?”
“Yowi —Marmi! I been like him alto-
gether.”
“Biit he kill your father, Cockroach.”
Cockroach laughed contemptuously.
“Yowi! He been killem father belongem
me altogether,” said Cockroach. “All right
that one! My father been very saucy feller.”
He jogged ahead again, leaving the white
men for their nearest view the skin
of Cockroach shining through the discre-
pancies of the waistcoat he wore upside
down and buttoned up the back.
RANDOLPH BEDFORD.
The Confessions of an Un-
frocked Solicitor.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE telephone rang sharply, and it
proved to be O’Shaughnessy from
Fowl Flat.
“Is that yerself, Mr. Short—l’d loike to
see ye in the mornin’ widout fail. The
police was up here last noight and there’s
the divil to pay.”
Our district was no-license, and police
raids were as common as second mortgages,
and for me equally 'profitable.
I slipped out of the office and went over
to the police station. It was as well to get
the facts at once, as nothing would induce
the Fowl Flat stouthearts to speak the truth
even to their counsel, and I had often got
into court to find half the representations in
my brief quite untenable.
Our sergeant was unique for his job—a
cultivated Scotchman, pleasant and easy-
going, but liable to be duty-struck in mat-
ters connected with liquor. As far as Tau-
whata knew he was a total abstainer, but
he went occasionally . for a secret jag, and
once started it was terrific. Ilis wife used
to consult me when an outbreak occurred,
and the resulting task was not. light. I got
rattling good costs for many an easier one.
At the second day he would collapse and
creep to bed a white and shaken wreck.
He was in his office when I called, in good
trim, with every button shining. He was
reading the able report of Constable
Maloney, who had conducted the onslaught
oa Fowl Flat. Things seemed conclusive.
The constable had called in plain clothes,
found, a crowd of people in a closed room
drinking, and £1 Is. 6d. on the counter. The
“take,” three bottles of English beer and
eight bottles of whisky, stood on the ser-
geant’s table.
O’Shaughnessy called in the morning and
we went into committee. He was quick at
suggestion, and I mentioned the matter of
birthdays. He thought it might have been Pat
Kennedy’s, and would see him. Annyway,
the witnesses were all good and shtout, and
he would wire his brother, who could bring
“three rale good wans” from Christchurch.
Everything seemed promising but for the
ineffacable £1 Is. 6d. Wednesday was court-
day, and we arranged a dress rehearsal for
Tuesday, all hands to stay that night at
Archibald’s boarding-house, the only one in
Tauwhata where it was certain there was no
liquor. Mrs. Archibald’s face was a guaran-
tee of that.
I was mixing myself a nightcap on Mon-
day night when my front-door bell rang
shrilly. Mrs. Johnston, stout and comely,
stood there wringing her hands.
“O Mr. Short,” she said, “do come round
at once ; Mr. Johnston’s on it again.”
Johnston was in bed in a pitiable state —
glassy-eyed and speechless. His wife was
bewildered. She had kept her usual relent-
less watch on him, and —where had he got it?
I went outside to the station office. The
lock-up was wide open and the feet of Mick
Kelly,, the local drunk, poked across the step.
I folded him up and shut the door on his
snores. The office door was ajar, and the
light of my candle solved the problem in
quick time. On the table stood one bottle of
beer. Johnston had drunk the evidence!
The two first necessities now were to get
Johnston right by court-day and to replace
the whisky. I hunted about for an hour or
two to find if there was a cache anywhere.
He could hardly have drunk eight bottles
in one day, and he had a habit, once well
filled, of hiding bottles from the hostile eye
of his wife. The search was useless; he was
thorough in all he did.
The whisky of the take had been Dewar’s,
and I had none in stock. Robinson, of the
Imperial Boarding-house (late Imperial
Hotel), proved to keep Watson’s. I raided
every friendly place in the town, but my
total gathering by the day’s end was five
bottles of the right brand.
By Tuesday night, after a day’s unremitting
toil, Johnston was making progress, full to
the neck with bromide tablets. On the
morning of court day I found him in fair
shape, but quivering like an aspen. Now it
was my turn to put in some good work for
ray clients. The point of the diseussioin
was the £1 Is. 6d. At the dress-rehearsal
everything had gone, as O’Shaughnessy put
it, “as shmooth as a lady’s shmoile.” The
witnesses proved to be up to specifica-
tion, and a bona-fide celebration of Pat Ken-
nedy’s birthday was quite evidently all that
was happening when the ill-mannered con-
stable broke in.
I conferred at length with Johnston (see
bill of costs). I had lifted twenty-five
pounds from O’Shaughnessy for “general pur-
poses,” and under the circumstances reckoned
to bag all of it. After a deal of marching
and counter-marching the sergeant agreed to
leave out all mention of the £1 Is. 6d. from
his report, and if Constable Maloney forgot
all about it his own memory would also
prove to be bad. Pat Kennedy reckoned he
knew the mahn, and that it was aisy.
And so it was. The only untoward inci-
dent in the proceedings was O’Shaughnessy’s
explosive whisper to me when the sergeant
gravely produced the “take.” “Holy Moses!
but where’s the other three bottles?”
The Magistrate’s decision, “Information
dismissed,” fell on grateful ears.
While having a drink with me afterwards I
nqticed he congratulated me drily on the com-
petent manner in which I had handled the
matter.
EX-GENT.
The Ring.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
DOWN drifts a petal that the sun
Has wrinkled, like a woman's
When her brief budding time is dune
The satin-smooth of girlhood’s grace—
The green leaf’s shadow by your shoou
Is tesselated with the noon.
And soft as a moth’s flitting wing,
Grey in the grey of summer dusk,
Across your hand the branches fling
The shades of censers filled with musk;
Though when you look they must disclose f
Themselves but shadows of a rose !
To me you stretch that dimpled hand,
Its middle finger holds a ring,
A bloodstone in a golden band,
Red blooms in gardens green as Spring;
Or, in some pleasance grey with grief,
Spilled heart’s blood on an olive leaf.
I wonder why you wear that ring?
I wonder, yet scarce dare to aak,
So wide the doors of memory swing.
The pleasant noonday drops its mask,
The roses to a dirge sway slow.
Because a woman, long ago,
In a green garden much as this,
Beneath a trellis just as fair,
Paid out her life for one quick kiss
And one red blossom in her hair,
And where the soft brown tendrils cling,
Wore on her finger such a ring.
Stay where you are, O dimpled hands!
You cannot reach my heart’s shut door,
For by its latch another stands
r To guard its secret evermore.
You could not fill that place of gloom
Nor venture in that haunted room.
Down drifts a petal like a kiss ;
Half vexed, your eyes are turned from me ;
The noon dreams out its golden bliss,
Blue-aisled with summer’s witchery.
A nd to and fro leaf-shadows string
Above the mockery of a ring.
