CONAN DOYLE’S NOVELS.
Conan Doyle is one of the most popular and
prolific of contemporary English story-tellers.
His vogue is hardly five years old; yet, within
those five years, he has published four substantial
novels and a multitude of short tales —in all, a
round dozen volumes, of which the sale exceeds
100,000 copies. His fertility is an index to his
literary status, for great works are not ground
out mechanically for the publishers. His popu-
larity is another such index, for great works are
rarely popular. Survey of Doyle’s performances
justifies the a 'priori suspicion that his success
is but a success of mediocrity. His writings suit
his public : they are not too good, but just good
enough. His chief virtue is his thoroughness—
the characteristic Scotch tenacity which gives the
lie to the theory that genius may be identified
with an infinite capacity for taking pains. There
is nothing of genius in Doyle ; but he has homely
talent and splendid industry. Considering its
extent, the uniformity of his work is surprising.
“ The Firm of Girdlestone” and half-a-dozen of
his short stories are all that can be ranked as
absolute failures ; and even the fotmer —a novel
of the newspaper order of architecture, skeletoned
off under heads and sub-heads, and then
laboriously filled in—seems to have interest for
readers of conventional trash-fiction.
# • *
Doyle, indeed, rarely fails in interest. He has
little originality of imagination; but give him a
foundation and he displays considerable originality
of workmanship. The keynote of his work is
conscientiousness: he chooses his incidents well,
and strains hard to po md out of each its last
atom of literary efficiency. Some of Sherlock
Holmes’ outre conclusions may seem to conflict
with this estimate; but they are none of them
imaginative leaps —all solid resuits of masculine
reasoning, built up step by s ep like a theorem
in mathematics. Doyle is essentially a short-
story writer. His novels are a mere suc-
cession of episodes through which stalk
characters without individuality or intrinsic
interest. “ The White Company.” his magnum
opus, is cons ructed with immense pains on the
best models. It has considerable interest of a
mechanical kind ; but the inspiration is as differ-
ent from that of genius as a maiden aunt from a
married angel. As in “ The Finn of Girdle-
stone,” the author has pieced together an elaborate
skeleton and laboriously covered it with flesh. It
is admirably done; but the man is not alive—is
only an image of life. The color and scenery are
very well given ; but the humor is poor, and there
is no art to conceal the art. You realise that
Doyle has carefully studied the methods by which
historical novelis's from Scott to Flaubert have
created their interest. There is one wrestling-
match, one duel on foot, one ditto on horseback,
one pitched battle, one attack on a castle (the
villeins are novel and effective), one sea-fight—
in fact, the whole box of tricks is carefully un-
packed ; and each is taken out, earnestly shown,
and put away again. It is an irritating fashion,
and damps enthusiasm for a really fine piece of
work.
# * *
Again, Doyle cannot always hide his echo. You
hear Kingsley in Hordle John’s eruption from the
monastery ; and Lytton is suggested later on.
Dumas and Cooper play parts in “Theßefugees ”
—an exciting story full of the handiwork of the
machine-god. In “ Micah Clarke,” Doyle echoes
himself; for Micah is little but but a replica of
Hordle John, with a touch of Alleyne, and he
plods wearily through the adventures laid down
for him. It is a pleasure to come suddenly upon
an infrequent twinkle like Gervas Jerome’s : “It
is a good rule to go upon, Clarke, in this earthly
pilgrimage, always to kiss the landlady. . . I
always carry a corkscrew, and I never forget to
kiss the landlady. ” “ t A Study in Scarlet, ” “ The
Sign of Four,” “ The Great Shadow,” and some
of the talcs in the “ Polestar ” volume, rank high
for interest, whatever their deficiencies as classical
fiction. It is doubtless unfair to judge work so
good in its way by the standard which one brings
to a professed masterpiece. “Raffles Haw” has
a good central idea, but only ephemeral merit;
and the recent “ Parasite ” and “Mystery of
Cloomber ” fall in the same category. In “ Round
the Red Lamp ” are found some of the author’s
best stories—with a deeper intellectual quality
than most of his earlier work, and a fine, thought-
ful fascination. Doyle, in fact, is generally worth
reading and rarely worth remembering. One
accompanies him with pleasure, and leaves him
without very much regret.

THE “KEEPER” PILE PILL
(Registered).
The PROPRIETORS of these Pills are well aware that
/there are many remedies (some of them really beneficial)
for this painful disease already in the market,, but know-
ing as they do the wonderful success of the “ KEEPER ”
PILL they have no hesitation in placing it in the very
front rank of Curative Medicines.
For years the medicine had only a local and limited
use, but now arrangements have been completed to make

colonies will have an opportunity of sharing with the old
country the benefits of this valuable remedy.
The medicine will be sold on its merits, in confident
assurance that its beneficent action will be a real boon to
sufferers.

dose. It will not cure every disease that flesh is heir to,
but it will cure Piles if taken in reasonable time, and
IT WILL GIVE RELIEF IN ALL CASES,
however stubborn and chronic, and the proprietors are
continually in receipt of most flattering and unsolicited
testimonials. Price, 2 6 per box (red label).

We constantly find cases of Hemorrhoids which are

or for any of our preparations, any marvellous curative
properties. We simply advise you, if suffering from slug-
gish or torpid liver, to spend 1/3 in a box of “ KEEPER ”

work, if you are generally run down from any cause, TRY

O TJRSELVES!
We wish it. to tie understood that the character of the
business we do, a d the absolutely inc usive variety of the
goods we Bill, entitle us to be called
UNIVERSAL PROVIDERS.
We are also not far out, consid' ring the low prices we
ask for everything we sell, and the consequent blessings
w« are continually showering upon the people, when we
assert, not in t nmrous tones, but with the trumpet voice
of confidence in the truth of what we say, when we dub
ourselves
PUBLIC BENEFACTORS.
There are good men in every sphere of life—honest
citizens in every community, whose deeds stamp them
for the approval of their f How-men, and single them out
from the common herd. Thus we find among the crowd
who aspire to serve their country on the benches of the
Legislative Assembly a patriot here and there w ho stands
out in hold r lief against the majority, whose sole aim
is place and pay. And in commercial life the sam 1 thing
occurs, and the same strong contrast between live few
disinterested- friends of the people, and the many s Ifish
lookers after the leg prolts they would like to make, is
plainly apparent. To the forra -r class, to the little hand
of merchants who study their customers’ interests, and
who, in self-abnegation and contentednegs, are willing to
accept small profits in reward for their services, belong
ANTHONY HORDERN’S.
They say that a good action is its own reward, but if the
good action entail hard work, much tribulation, and con-
linual strife, then surely the laborer is worthy of his hire,
at d the doer of good actions entitled to some recompense
at the hands of those who profit by what he does.
ANTHONY HORDERN’S
nevercease from their toil ; in the burden and heat of the
noonday sun lh<y work, oppressed by the cruel frost of
somewhile baffled efforts and frustrated negotiations, they
continue, knowing alw’ays that the approval of millions of
souls is theirs. For three-quarters of a century it has
been so, and for a longer time than that it will remain as
it has been. Generations passed away have bought from
the great house, and generations yet to come will do the
same. Like the practice of honesty or truth, there is a
policy in it which brings to its adherents
PROFIT AND SATISFACTION.

SKINS ON FIRE
With Agonizing Eczemas and other Itching, Burning, Scaly, and
Blotchy Skin and Scalp Diseases are relieved in the n.i.j rity of cases
by a single application of the Cuticura Remedies, and speedily, perma-
nently, and economically cured, when phy-
sicians, hospitals, and all other remedies
fail. Cuticura Remedies are the great-
est skin cures, blood purifiers, and humor
remedies of modern times, are absolutely
pure, and may be used in the treatment of
every humor, from the simplest facial blem-
ishes to the severest diseases of the blood,
skin, and scalp.
The great Skin Cure, instantly allays the
most intense itching, burning, and inflamma-
tion, permits rest and sleep, clears the scalp
of crusts and scales, speedily soothes and
heals raw and irritated surfaces, and restores
the hair. Cuticura Soap, an exquisite
Skin Purifier and Beaulifier, is indispensa-
ble in cleansing diseased surfaces. Cuti-
cura Resolvent, the new Blood and Skin
Purifier, and greatest of Humor Remedies,
cleanses the blood of all impurities and poi-
sonous elements, and thus removes the cause. Hence the Cuticur \ Reme-
dies cure every disease and humor of the skin, from pimples to scrofula.

Various Verses ,
[FOR THE BULLETIN]
SHE DOES NOT KNOW: SONG WORDS.
Longtime her face has melted now
To slumbrous eyes and shadow hair—
O, mortal nature thrive and sow
Thy flickering signet everywhere !
Yet still the tyrant memory flies,
Dissolving shades before the mind,
Where surge the sheen of startled eyes
And sad lips quivering in the wind.
Let tears flow faster, lips grow pale,
Let breaking hearts beat e’er so low,
Let cowards tell their well-told tale,
She shall not know. She shall not know.
For who would tell in this worn time,
r As night shafts speed from Even’s bow,
That dull lie moulded in the prime—
I Jove you so ! I love you so !
I love you so—it stings the tongue,
And scars the ear whereon it falls —
Stretch forth and let thy heart be wrung,
And chain thy soul in prison walls.
The night goes shuddering through the stars,
The baffled winds moan to and fro,
A great heart strains its slender bars —
She does not know. She does not know.

CRECHE SOCIETIES.
[lt was the custom, among the more “ tender-hearted ”
Jewish women of 2000 years ago, to give a cup of drugged
wine to criminals about to be crucified, in order to
deaden them to the agony of their punishment. Such a
potion was offered to Jesus of Nazareth on His way to the
cross. He, however, refused it.]
In holy charity and pious love
The wealthy women of our Christian land
Stretch out to fallen sisterhood a hand
That lifts the base-born young a step above.
A wondrous creed it is, which thus can move
Their mother-hearts, and still can let them
stand,
Unshrinking, in the robes and jewels grand
Bought with the blood and sin of yon foul drove
That herds within their tenements. E’en so
In far Judea, when that creed was born
Which now enfolds naught save hypocrisy,
Did women of two thousand years ago
Take pity on their Christ, scourged, tired, for-
lorn,
And offered Him the drug—and then the tree !
Yio.
C.P.R.
A DREAM.
Methought I was fevered and restless.
And sleep had deserted my bed ;
I rose up and walked through a city—
A city wiiose voices were dead.
Around and about me was stillness,
And I was alone in the street;
My footfall alone broke the silence—
The silence and stillness complete.
I thought : can it be that I only
Am living—the last of all men ?
I cried out: “O. God !I am lonely.
Give life to Thy creatures again.”
When out from a cloud came, in thunder,
A voice that seems near to me now ;
A voice that said ; “ I am more lonely,
Aye, even more lonely than thou.
“For even amongst all the millions
That ages and aeons have brought
To dwell in the mansions of Heaven,
There’s none like to me in my court.
“For I am the God of all ages,
Enthroned on the uppermost throne ;
No equal have I in high Heaven,
Where reign I for ever alone.”
S.
COMPROMISE.
I pencil glaring wings of Right
With Wrong’s sedater black ;
And rushing Freedom’s crotchets with
Resurgent minims slack.
I paralyse the hand of God
When He would loose at last
The cataract of vengeance, due
For age-old crimes of caste ;
For froward Duty hesitates
When wrongs grow vested rights,
And squealing Pity wards the blow
Relentless Justice smites.
The limpid clarity of Truth
I phosphoresce with lies,
And put sophistic hectics on
The pallor of the Wise.
Insipid grace of Love I lead
To Lust’s lips’ hydromel ;
Or twine the snow-cold Heaven with
The glowing limbs of hell.

TO A MAORILAND ROBIN.
I may not fit the music of thy song
To any phrases of my halting measure ;
To thee, and thee alone, can this belong—
Thy love-trill’s joyous treasure.
Yet may I listen till the after-glow
Melts in the duskiness of Night’s soft tresses—
Regretful that thy sweet song’s ardent flow
Disdains the Night’s caresses.
In the sweet witchery of thy far song
A world of happy thoughts and idle dreamings
Come from the fairyland where Youth belongs,
That hath its idle gleanings.
Thou lovest Day, with all his changing moods,
And when it dies thy notes grow low and
tender —
The Night, like Death, within the shadow broods,
Thy song hath nought to lend her.
Sweet Love’s despair? or longing for thy mate?
Inspires thy minstrelsy, mayhap, with sadness ;
But Death hath nought to do with love or hate—
Nor all thy songs with gladness.
Yet, would I fain beyond the after-glow,
Ask for one moment but to hear thy singing ;
Death’s way is dark, and mortals thither go,
No sound of song there bringing.

The Foreign-Trade Resurrection.
Premier Reid’s budget speech is supposed
to mark the beginning of another alleged
Freetrade epoch in New South Wales.
Whether it really marks the beginning of
such an epoch, or the beginning of anything
at all, no reasonable person can profess to
know. The Government programme is too
unwieldy to have any serious prospect of
success. There are several things in it that
are excellent, some that are wholly bad, and
some that are absolutely ridiculous. It is so
large and expansive that when it is brought
in by a man of Premier Reid’s calibre the
spectacle is suggestive of an ant bringing in
a bag of flour. The fact that no one has, so
far, ever been able to take Mr. Reid
seriously tells against him now more than at
any previous stage of his political career.
Even a politician of much larger dimensions
would hardly be taken seriously under like
circumstances.
# * #
Premier Reid closed the last year with an
alleged deficit of £271,000. The real deficit
was nearly £490,000, but by a beautifully
original process £216,000 —expended in the
latter part of 1894 and the beginning
of 1895—was debited to 1893 and
charged to the preceding Government. The
same financier’s deficit for the first half of
1895 is £239,000, but it is converted into a
surplus by chaiging to loans a sum of
£345,000 which his predecessors had already
paid out of revenue, and annexing this
amount out of loan-funds. This novel mode
of finance says little for the Treasurer’s
political honesty ; it is, in fact, about the
most densely stupid mode of manipulating
the public accounts yet invented. The
shortage, as is usual with all New South
Wales shortages, is to be liquidated for the
present by the issue of Treasury bills, and
passed on to posterity. Everything that is
bad is passed on to posterity in Australia.
The Treasury bills are to be paid later on by
means of the successive surpluses which are
to arise through a “sound system of finance,”
but as Mr. Reid’s sound finance has so far
only produced two deficits and no surplus at
all, this settlement looks hazy and very
far oft’. Also, it is promised, for the
several-dozenth time within a year, that
the public accounts are to be put into
such a shape as to be absolutely intelligible
to everybody. This promise, however, looks
none too brilliant in view of the incompre-
hensible manner of Mr. Reid’s accounts up
to date ; moreover, previous Treasurers have
been for many years on the point of doing
the same thing, and yet nothing has eventu-
ated. In future, according to the N.S.W.
Premier, the chaotic system of debiting
expenditure back to previous years is to
cease entirely. Which is especially good
news as coming from a Government which
has carried that evil practice to a greater
extent than any of its predecessors.
• # *
The present Government came into office
with—to use its own frequent expression—
a mandate from the country to establish a
pure and absolute system of Freetrade.
There is abundant room to doubt the wisdom
or intelligence of the country, but about the
mandate there is no possible doubt whatever
It was as definite as any such mandate could
be, and as decisive as a large majority could
make it. Under these circumstances, it is
lamentable to meet once more with the same
old disappointment which has followed every
Freetrade upheaval within the memory of
this generation. There is to be no Freetrade
after all. There are to be duties on alcohol,
tobacco in all shapes, and on narcotics. A
duty of Id. per lb. on candles is to be
retained for two years, after which time
it is to disappear gradually—if the Reid
Government happens to be still in office,
and the Houge endorses its action, and it has
the courage of its opinions. A duty is to be
levied on kerosene for another 12 months, at
the end of which period the Government
gives its unsupported assurance that it will
be removed. The duty on sugar, confec-
tionery, &c., is to remain unchanged for two
years, and then, if the Government survives
and doesn’t change its mind, and its majority
still keeps up, the country has its personal
asseveration that the evil thing will be re-
moved so gradually that it will not finally
disappear until 1902. The duties on salt,
galvanised iron, wire netting, &c., are to re-
main for 12 months, when the Reid Govern-
ment gives its political P/N, without endorse-
ment, that they will be abolished. All the
rest of the old revenue duties of the Parkes
regime are to be maintained until June, 1896,
and the grain duties levied by the Dibbs
Government are to remain for another five
months. Also, the Premier, after announcing
overnight his resolve to abolish all duties
except those specifically mentioned, pro-
ceeded next morning to collect at the'Customs
a lot of entirely new duties, mostly on the
necessaries of life, concerning which imposts
no notice whatever had been given. Under
these circumstances, even Mr. Reid’s Free-
trade revival is so far off that he and his Min-
istry can hardly expect to live until its arrival.
Possibly they don’t want to. Their desire,
apparently, is to avert their great nostrum in
their own lifetime. Considering bow long
and consistently New South Wales has
voted the Freetrade ticket, and yet
that the province has never once en-
joyed enough Freetrade to know what
that great principle is like, this renewed
disappointment is irritating. The fact
that, out of a long and dreary suc-
cession of Freetraue politicians, not one has
dared to carry out his convictions, or to come
within 100 miles of carrying out his convic-
tions, almost suggests ‘that there is some-
thing wrong with the great principle, and
that its own advocates are afraid to give it a
trial lest they should be unable thereafter to
advocate it with a semblance of decency any
longer,
• • •
The reason assigned by Mr. Reid for re-
moving certain of the existing duties on
manufactured goods is that they raise prices
and thus fall heavily on the consumer, and
the reason assigned for removing the duties
on agricultural produce is that they reduce
prices and thus descend with a sickenimr
thud on the producer. The reason assigned
for not abolishing the duty on sugar, which
is a necessary alike to rich and poor, is that
the revenue which it yields can’t be dis-
pensed with ; and the apparent reason for
abolishing the duties on silks, satins, pianos,
jewellery, precious stones, pictures, &c.,
which are mere luxuries, is that the revenue
can be dispensed with. Freetrade, accord-
ing to the Premier, is good for everybody,
yet special concessions in the way of Protec-
tion are made to the sugar, galvanised iron,
wire netting, confectionery, kerosene, candle,
and several dozen other industries by way of
“acting leniently.” Leniency, in this case,
is, therefore, apparently, an effort to prevent
the blessings of Freetrade from falling on
the people too suddenly, and a gradual re-
moval of the curse of Protection lest the
country might feel the want of it too severely.
Altogether, Premier Reid’s fiscal policy is
about the most wobblesome thing of its kind
which New South Wales has met with for a
long time, and the country’s chronic inability
to take its small, fat statesman in a serious
spirit will be considerably aggravated
thereby.
* * *
It is estimated that the alterations in the
tariff will involve a loss of £555,000 per
annum, and this is to be made up, partly by
increased legacy and succession duties—
partly by means of the laud and income-tax,
and partly by retrenchment. All these pro-
posals are eminently commendable, and so
also is the scheme for placing the Civil Ser-
vice under the control of three independent
Commissioners, with a view to eliminating
political influence and establishing the public
departments on a purely business footing.
The Premier likewise announces that ho has
made a saving of £lOO,OOO on the Civil
Service for the ensuing year, though there
are, so far, no visible signs of any such
saving on the Estimates. A large, but
rather shadowy scheme of relief for the un-
employed is announced, apparently with a
solemn conviction that the Reid policy is
not calculated in itself to relieve destitution,
and that Freetrade, as a remedy for poverty
and chronic scarcity of work, is a failure. It
is proposed to amalgamate the Post Office
and the Commissioners’ Savings Banks, a
measure which has nothing special to recom-
mend it save that it will enable stone-
broke Governments, which now secretly
borrow the funds of the former institution, to
borrow those of the latter also ; and at some
very vague and unspecified date, when the
Government is fully rested, it is suggested that
this combined institution may be made the
sole note-issuing bank of N.S. Wales. Also,
with a judicious recognition of the fact that
Freetrade in grain and other produce won’t
help the struggling agriculturist, but will
rather be a further weight upon him, it is
proposed to extend the term allowed for the
payment of selectors’ instalments from the
already liberal term of thirty-two years to
sixty-six—or two-thirds of a century.
* * *
The good features about the Financial
Statement are those which have no definite
connection with it; the bad feature about
the Statement is the Statement itself. The
proposal to create a State bank of issue, and
make the paper currency of the country a
Government monopoly, backed by the public
credit, is one which cannot be too highly
praised, and though it has no earthly con-
nection with the finances of the year, it helps
to lend to the budget a respectability which
is not its own. Unfortunately, however,
the Premier merely states on his own respon-
sibility that such a reform should be effected.
He distinctly refuses to pledge the Govern-
ment to support it ; he also does not
pledge himself to support it ; neither does
he fix a date when a bill will be intro-
duced to this effect —in fact, there is no
semblance of a promise that any such bill
will ever be introduced. Under these con-
ditions the hest feature in the Financial
Statement is too shadowy to be of any
serious account. The appointment of a
Civil Service Commission is another purely
extraneous matter, and although it is a
statesmanlike scheme (or would be, if it were
proposed to make the Commission respon-
sible to Parliament only instead of to the
Ministry of the day) and one which could
hardly fail to be an improvement on the pre-
sent chaotic system, its inclusion in the State-
ment makes the Government’s finance no
better in theimmediate present Thepostpone-
mentof selectors’arrears isseeminglya clumsy
bribe to the agricultural interest—which is
mainly Protectionist ; and the unemployed
relief scheme comes with a bad grace from
the man who proposed to “save the country ”
and abolish the necessity for such relief in
the future. As for the actual finance of the
Ministry it is, in the main, half-hearted.
New South Wales has had many alleged
Freetrade Governments, but it has never had
Freetrade. Yet it has voted for that
monstrosity so often that it deserves to get
it. The obvious duty of Mr. Reid and his
following is to remove, wholly and at
once, the duties on agricultural pro-
duce, sugar, candies, kerosene, salt, wire-
netting, and everything else. If the
needful revenue cannot, by any lawful
means, be otherwise obtained, then an
exception may possibly be made, for purely
revenue purposes, in favor of tobacco, alco-
hol, and opium, but there is no earthly
reason, save the weakness of the Premier s
political knees, why the exception should go
any further. The advantages of having a
Freetrade majority and a Freetrade Govern-
ment, if the country has not, and is not
going to have, Freetrade, are not very ap-
parent. Also, The Bulletin, at all events,
is tired of a system whereby an alleged
Freetrade Government runs a semi-Protec-
tive tariff, and if things go well the
Freetrade Government is the cause, and if
they go ill the Protective tariff is responsible.
In short, this paper wants a Government
which will go in definitely and conscien-
tiously and entirely for either Freetrade or
Protection, or else will say distinctly that it
commits itself to neither policy and claims
the right to be guided by circumstances. So
far, however, New South Wales has only
had Protectionist Governments which did
not protect, and Freetrade Governments
which did not set trade free, and similar
anomalies.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Newspaper Postage.
New South Wales Treasurer Retd omits from
his financial programme one easily-imposed tax
which would yield the province perhaps £25,000
per annum. That is a postage-fee of |d. each
on newspapers carried within the province. All
other Australasian provinces take this revenue :
there is no good reason why New South Wales
should refuse it. Every morning special trains
labour out of Sydney to do nothing but carry
the metropolitan dailies free of charge into the
country. If a man starts a grocery business,
and sets out to swamp the back-blocks with his
particular brand of soap and candles, the rail-
way authorities charge him freight as a matter
of course. It is recognised that the State does
not borrow money to build railways, and the
taxpayers do not sweat to pay the interest on
the borrowed money, in order that one man
may make large profits out of soap and candles.
But when a man starts a newspaper business,
and begins to collect back-block pennies in
exchange for his particular brand of politics
and his particular variety of prejudices, the
State immediately pays* a' large staff of men
wages, and incurs heavy expenditure on rail-
way rolling-stock, in order to make his divi-
dends larger. Free postage means the gain of
thousands a year to*, the S.M. Herald,
Sydney Telegraph and other metropolitan
journals. Why should the proprietors of
newspapers be subsidised by the State
simply because they have invested their
money in newspapers instead of in drapery
or ironmongery ? Why should those who
clamor so loudly fur freetrade receive
so much protection —protection at the ex-
pense of the country press, which is quite
as well fitted to disseminate truth and light
as its city rivals, yet is starved and out-at-
elbows because Govt, gives the naturally well-
handicapped city man the additional handicap
of free postage ? Of course, newspapers are
the voice of progress, the vehicle of knowledge;
but they are not published solely to promote
knowledge and progress. Their first object is
a cash return to their proprietors ; and, if the
fine ideals conflict with that object, the fine
ideals may go hang. Anyhow, people who can
afford to pay a private speculator for supplying
them with news, can afford to pay Govt, for
supplying the supply. When “Shakespeare”has
to pay postage John Fairfax and Sons ought
to pay, too. So ought The Bulletin, as this
paper cheerfully admits. The Bulletin doesn’t
want the assembly of taxpayers to put hands
in their pockets to carry it to its subscribers ;
and it cordially invites Treasurer Reid to make
it pay postage—and every other newspaper as
well.
• ■*
The Coalition.
The very latest move in N.S.W. politics is the
coalition between the Protectionist Opposition
and that scrag-end of the nondescript faction
which is led by Mr. Henry Parkes. For the
time, at least, G. Republican Dibbs stands out
from his position of chief (one can’t be Premier
and Agent-General at the same time), and the
unholy alliance is to make a rush for the loaves
and fishes, under Parkes’s leadership. If the
attack succeeds, then Parkes, the Daddy
Christmas of N.S.W. politics, the boss Free-
trader and Kiama Ghost fanatic, will be
Premier of a Protectionist Ministry, with the
old Protectionist party as his principal support.
The semi-Protective Dibbs tariff will remain-
in that respect the Protectionists appear to got
the best of the deal; and the new Parkes
Ministry will come to the front with a great
whoop for Federation ; and Parkes will state
that he doesn’t adopt the Protectionist tariff
because he has changed his views, for he is the
same consistent Parkes as aforetime, nor be-
cause he wants office, because he returns to
power with extreme reluctance ; but simply be-
cause Australian unity is of such vast import-
ance that everything else is trivial by compari-
son. In which case, Mr. H. Parkes will speak
the truth by accident. The whole proceeding
is a miserable case of folly, greed, bad general-
ship, blundering, and insensate muddle. If
Parkes wins, he gets office. If he doesn’t
win, he loses nothing. He has been so
many things in his time that he may be-
come Protectionist, Mahommedan, Theosophist,
Spiritualist, Roman Catholic, vegetarian, or
dog-worshipper in his old age without becoming
any more grotesque than he already is. But if
Parkes wins, the Protectionists gain the eternal
disgrace of having thrown over their leade‘r and
allied themselves with their worst enemy,
chiefly for the sake of a few portfolios and”a
little official salary, aud if Parkes doesn’t win,
they gain the same disgrace without any cor-
responding advantage. They don’t, it is true,
wholly surrender their principles for the sake
of office, for the Dibbs tariff is to be maintained
so far as it goes, but they agree to forego any
attempt at genuine Protection, for the time at
all events, and that ignoble compromise is at
least a partial surrender of principle. But, even
if there was no compromise at all, and no sur-
render of principle whatever, the Protectionist-
party can’t afford to associate itself with
Parkes. No party, in fact, can afford to asso-
ciate itself with Parkes. And if Premier Reid
is defeated and obtains a dissolution, arid forces '
the Protectionist-party to go to the country
under the virtual guidance of Parkes, its situa-
tion will be ridiculous and wholly pitiable.
Moreover, the entire business is done at
the wrong time. The country put G. H.
Reid in office with a. large majority, and
he should be left to prove his incapacity
to its fullest extent. So far, he has been de-
feated six or eight times; his Local Government
Bill has been lost; his Land and Income-tax Bill
has been altered in many of its leading features
simply because of his inability to write plain
English and do simple arithmetic; his two
financial statements have been cooked in the
most childish fashion ; his promised Freetrade
tariff consists in promising to remove a number
of duties in a dim future which extends as fat
as six years ahead, and in putting on certain
other duties in the immediate present without
even informing Parliament of his intention ;
and his economies consist largely in promising
to default to the extent of =8200,000 in the pay-
ments to the public creditor. Another year or
so of this unspeakable mismanagement would
make an end of G. H. Reid and his alleged
Freetrade party for a generation to come.
The attempt to eject him before he has time to
show his own hopeless futility, and the hopeless
futility of his alleged policy, is simply cutting
down the partially hanged enemy before he is
dead, and leaving him to resuscitate for future
use. The country decided that it wanted G.
H. Reid, and it should be allowed to have him
until it decities that it will never want him any
more. The Bulletin, in the cause of Federa-
tion and Protection, votes for Reid’s continu-


ance in office. Nothing will do so much good
for either cause as Reid’s continuance in office.
Government by Contradiction.
The Reid (N.S.W.) Government was defeated
the other night by a crushing majority of 36
votes against 16 upon its little, unobtrusive
I>road Rill, and the Bill itself disappeared in
consequence. It was also twice badly defeated
over the Local Government Bill—one of the
most important measures on its political pro-
gramme, which was also cast into outer dark-
ness ; and before this it was defeated several
times on various details connected with the
same Bill, and several more times on other
topics of more or less importance. The Reid
Government goes on the even tenor of its way
regardless of all these defeats. And the Sydney
Freetrade papers, which denounced the shame-
lessness and mercenary spirit and wicked
office-grabbing of the previous Ministry for
holding its ground after one small reverse, have
not, so far, even hinted that it is time for
the present crowd to retire from the scene.
As a matter of fact, the Reid Cabinet
is fully justified in holding on, and the preced-
ing Dibbs Cabinet—which hung on much less
tenaciously—was also justified. The country
presumably wanted Reid as Premier, else it
would not have returned him to office, and as
the Assembly refuses to throw him out on a
definite motion of censure it appears that it
still wants him, so far as its ideas on the sub-
ject can be ascertained. The fact that the
country, or the Assembly, wants Premier Reid
in no way implies, however, that it wants his
Bread Bill, or his particular brand of Local
Government, and it should be at full liberty to
keep him and to reject or amend them at its
own discretion. It should also be at liberty, if
it so desires, to keep him while rejecting
or amending every * other item in his
political programme, or to keep him while
rejecting any or all of his colleagues, or to keep
his colleagues while rejecting him, or to do any-
thing else it pleases. The party system, by
which the Legislature has to accept the whole
Ministry and the whole Ministerial programme
or else reject the lot, is mere foolishness ; and
the new departure of the Reid Government,
which allows the Assembly to reject or alter its
bills but refuses to quit without direct in-
structions to that effect, is the beginning of a
change for the better. Whether the present
New South Wales Cabinet inaugurated the new
method out of weakness, or greed of office, or
a patriotic desire to amend an exceedingly
foolish political system, or through a mere ten-
dency to drift, is a mere side - issue. The
method itself is an improvement, and the
motive is the Cabinet’s own affair.
How Thing-s Don’t Happen
In Victoria, a few days ago, a girl of 17 laid an
information for rape against her father, a
State-school teacher. She stuck to her ghastly
tale for some little time, and then broke up and
acknowledged that it was a pure invention
from beginning to end ! The only reason for
her astounding lie was that the old man had
strongly objected to her “ walking out” with a
young man. So far, there is no news of the
arrest for gross perjury of this dangerous
woman, who is certainly unfit to be at large.
Neither has The Bulletin ever heard of the
arrest of the girl who swore falsely against
Buttner a good many years ago, and brought
him within seven days’ march of the gallows.
Nor has it heard of the arrest of any one of a
dozen females who laid criminal charges against
different men after the Mount Rennie episode,
all which charges proved to be utterly falsej
and most of them the result of unsuccessful
efforts at blackmail. It is an unwritten law in
Australia that any female may bring the most
horrible charges against any man, and even
though they are proved to be pure invention,
she will go free. Also, it would really
appear to be another unwritten law that,
no matter how many such females are
bowled out, Judges shall sit down indig-
nantly on any barrister who expresses a doubt
as to the absolute purity and reliability of the
next female. At Ohiltern a girl of 18 years
recently charged two men with having
criminally assaulted her, but having under
cioss-examination tick now lodged that her evi-
deuce - in-chief was untrue, and that if the
prisoners had given her money as they pro-
mised she would not have made the charges,
the accused were discharged. At Warrnambool*
the same week a girl, who complained of having
been outraged by two men who were arrested
for the offence, was clearly shown to be a 24-
carat liar, but nothing happened to her except
that the bench discharged her intended prey.
Also, nothing happened to the Ohiltern per-
jurer. Nothing ever happens, in fact.
Straining- at a Gnat.
Melbourne’s respectable Argus is up in arms
against an alleged case of Bench-packing at
Oollingwood police-court. It was not an ordi-
nary case, such as occurs a hundred times per
annum in Victoria without fetching a ghost of
a groan from the Freetrade organ. This was a
revolting instance —so the AkguS says—of
certain “ Trades-hall justices” packing the
Bench in the interests of “ union pickets who
were summoned for misbehavior.” The dis-
graceful pickets escaped condign punishment;
all the charges against them were dismissed,
wherefore the Argus calls upon the Ministry to
bundle the offending magistrates, neck and
ciop, off the Bench as an example.” The
Bulletin begs to second the resolution. It is
time that a batch of men were bundled off
the Bench as an example, and even though
the Trades’-hall justices might not answer the
purpose of a shocking example, they ought to
go. Then the public would quickly discover
reasons why the whole crowd of honorary
magistrates ought to be bundled off likewise,
tor the sake of common decency, and these, in
their turn, might “split upon” the paid ben Its,
and direct attention to bad Judges ; and
' I( d°ria, after all, might become quite a clean
and wholesome abiding place. The curse of
the country, thus far, is that nobody of im-
portance gets thrown out neck and crop for
doing anything. As for lawyers, they are out-
sule the pale of retribution altogether.
At a Melbourne attorney were to mur-
der a member of another ptofession—say
% U (A 10nist P icket “-he would escape with a fine
ot 40s. or a month. If he were to murder a
rival lawyer, or slaughter a learned brother in
cold blood, that would be more awkward. The
t all Court would no doubt discuss the case and
take up a compromise. But we don’t hear the
Ahijus singing out in this strain. A rotten
state of affairs seems quite good enough for a
great ’ newspaper until Freetrader particular
om lre , to pufc (lown union Pickets is baulked by
Irades-hall justices.” Then is the time for
tc country to shake the dew-drops from its
mane and protect the interests of cheap labor.
The “ Opening- Far North.
Mr. Dashwood, Government Resident in the
-Northern territory, announces it as his con-
viction that “ the only feasible scheme for
opening up” that # great Land of Desolation is
a transcontinental railway on the land-
grant system. This yearning to “open up”
new territory is a complaint which needs to be
watched. At present Australia has more land
opened up to a greater or less extent than her
population can inhabit. It wouldn’t pay to open
up the Northern Territory in the usual fashion,
because there is not sufficient population there
to support a railway, and one reason why there
is not sufficient population is that settlement
happened to begin at the other end of Aus-
tralia, and the country hasn’t yet grown enough
people to spread over the intervening spaces,
ihe population and the railway will get there
about the same time, and the Territory will be
opened up in the ordinary course of events
just as soon as it is wanted, and no sooner.
Also, when the population gets there, steam-
ship hues will begin to patrol the Northern
coast, and call in at all the ports there
as regularly as they now do at Sydney
or Melbourne. At present, sea communication
is scarce for the same reason that land com-
munication is non-existent—there is little or
nothing to support it. The proposal to give
away a vast area of land, which will be badly
required by-and-bye, in order to open up a dis-
trict which doesn’t need to be opened for the
next twenty years at least, and to support a
railway which isn t wanted, and to bring in
people to settle on the land just when the State
has given away all its land to a railway
syndicate, and has nothing left to settle
them on, is an upside-down mode of pro-
cedure. Moreover, even if the land was
“ opened-up ”by a transcontinental line, and
a great body of settlers arrived to grow crops
there, they couldn’t possibly send their produce
away by that line, for the simple reason that it
wouldn’t pay for the cost of transit, and the
great railway would be the worst white ele-
phant in Australia. Until this country can
raise 2,000,000 people to inhabit the Northern
ierritoiy which it can’t do at present—it
had better be left unopened. The Territory
will be wanted badly enough half a century
hence, and when it is wanted it will open itself
up. The attempt to seize population by the
scruff of the neck and run it violently into
places where at present it doesn’t want to go is
always a failure.
The Sydney Foreign-trade press expresses its
scornful wonder at the very apparent fact that
there is hardly a prominent Protectionist in
Victoria who is not an ardent Australian
lederationist, and who - is not vigorous in his
demand for the removal of barriers to inter-
provincial Freetrade. Your Freetrader never
can understand a practical result that does not
coincide with a sketched theory. Inter-
provincial Freetrade is part of the very
essence and nature of Australian Protec-
tion. 1 lie difference between Freetrade
and Protection is that the first is dogmatic
and the second is eclectic. One is a “ school
the other is a living adaptation. Freetrade is,
asserted to be an absolute verity, incapable of
shock from any rude circumstance whatever—
a cure-all—a remedy for anything, from com-
mercial leprosy to trade squint. Protection, on
the other hand, is the particular expediency that
is deemed to be the wisest under conditions as
they arise and circumstances as they occur.
Protection can conceive of a land and a people
being so situated that their natural and most
beneficial policy would be Freetrade. Freetrade
cannot conceive of any land and any people
being so circumstanced that they would need
protection. Protection thus takes geographical
and climatic conditions, and especially geogra-
phical homogeneity, into consideration ; and it
is owing to this necessity of Protection that
Australian Protection has as its “square root,”
so to speak, interprovincial Freetrade. So long
as the provinces were, and are, contentiously
apart, so long was, and is, interprovincial Free-
trade no factor at all in their individual
policies. Victorian Protection took no thought
of it until New South Wales Protection
presented the retaliatory reverse of the shield.
It is safe to say that New South Wales Protec-
tion has effected more than any other single
cause in converting Victorian Protectionists “to
interprovincial Freetrade. And, with a unified
Australia, there can be no other possible policy.
For then will not only border duties be abol-
ished, but, in many senses, borders also.
The other day, in a Melbourne police-court, an
aged and infirm woman was brought up on a
charge of vagrancy. Her son, a fairly well-to-
do man, appeared in court, and when, in giving
his evidence, he was asked whether the accused
was his mother, he replied that she was “in a
sort of a way,” which qualification he after-
wards explained as meaning that he was her
illegitimate offspring. The bench thereupon
told him that he should have been ashamed of
himself to have mentioned such a matter, and
upon his further declining to take over and
keep the poor old woman some more invectives
were thrown at him and he left the court.
There can be no two opinions as to whether
this man deserved the reflections of the Bench
or not; but the question arises whether, a man
being liable to the disadvantages of illegitimacy,
he is not logically entitled to its advantages.
Probably the humane and delicately-minded
person in the foregoing report had been
throughout his life subjected to all manner of
taunts and jeers from the ultra-respectable por-
tion of the country until he had become utterly
callous to them. Had the mother been heiress
to any legacy and died intestate he would
have received not a penny thereof, and in a
number of families his “birth-stain” would
have been an effectual bar to his marriage with
one of its daughters. Therefore, having had
to contend against all these opposing forces from
which the legitimate are free, he certainly
appears entitled to some consideration when he
asks to be relieved of the moral obligation
which humanity imposes upon the healthy
young to support their parents in their old age.
Some of the evidence given re the Yarra tunnel
disaster seems to put an even uglier comnlexion
on that event than it previously wore. As
deduced from the report of the inquest the
story reads very much as follows : The ground
was known to be extremely treacherous, and
had to be kept up by air-pressure. When the
air-lock was left open then the door leading
into the face was firmly closed by the pressure,
and escape was impossible. The air-lock was
left open for half-an-hour at a time, and was
open at the time of the fatality. The door
leading into the face might possibly have been
pushed open by a great combined effort from
outside, and the imprisoned men enabled to
escape, but the effort wasn’t made because two
trucks had bepn left blocking the road. There
was, possibly, just a shadow of a chance that
the air-pressure in the chamber where the men
were working might have partially resisted the
inflow of water and given the victims a
slight hope of escape, but somebody opened
the valve in an effort to fill the lock,
and forgot to shut it again, and thus
let the air escape, and put a summary
end to this possibility. Nobody was kept close
to the door to watch for signals, in case
anything did go wrong with the men at work
in the death-trap. There was apparently no
definite code of communication, for when the
men at the face made frantic signs through
the glass pane that they wanted to get out their
gesticulations were interpreted to mean that
they wanted someone else to come in. And
all this cheerful and easy-going recklessness
was carried on despite the fact that for two or
three weeks there had been a considerable
inflow of water through the rotten strata over-
head, which was a tolerably clear proof that a
bigger inflow might come in at any moment.
Yet the contractors were rushed with men
anxious to toil under these gruesome conditions
for 7s. a day, and despite this fact the Fat Man
still rises to declare, from behind Ids abundant
white vest, that the “unemployed” are mere
loafers who won’t work when the chance pre-
sents itself.
At Katoomba, the other day, Chief Justice
Harley said, amongst other things, that
“British justice would always be found im-
partial.” The pronouncement sounds well, but
does it mean that the Dean trial was an im-
partial one, or that the Mount Rennie trial was
a sample of British justice ? As Chief Justice,
Acting-Gov. Darley must be held in no small
degree responsible for the effect of two exhibi-
tions which have brought one division of the
N.S. Wales Supreme Court into odium with
all honest citizens, and have degraded Australian
justice in the eyes of the world. If Chief
Justice Darley, figure-head of the New South
Wales superior Bench, and official protector
of the corporate dignity thereof, cannot
initiate measures to prevent his Court being
brought into general disrepute, he had better
retire to Dublin. His predecessor, Chief Justice
Martin, would not have allowed the honor and
prestige of the Supreme Court to be thus
dragged into the mire by the unseemly
vagaries of any wearer of the ermine. Never
in Judge Martin’s day were there witnessed
such disgraceful spectacles, involving the degra-
dation and humiliation of the chief jurisdiction
of the supreme tribunal of the province.
A Perth draper—one of the hated crowd of
“ other-siders ” —had qualified by a six months’
residence as a Parliamentary elector. At the
time when he tilled in his application, however,
he was about to remove to another house in the
same electorate, and in the application he set
down his qualification as six months’ residence
at the new address instead of the old one. As
his removal did not invalidate his claim, the
act could not possibly be a fraudulent scheme
to get a vote to which he was not entitled ; he
had an equal right to the vote whether he re-
moved or not, and no man could fairly be sus-
pected of an 'attempt to dishonestly acquire
what ho already possessed by honest means.
Nevertheless, a typically pig-headed VVestralian
jury found him guilty of fraud on the strength
of this mis-statement, and the Chief-Justice,
after a solemn deliverance about the enormity
of his offence, “ which quite amounted to per-
jury,” sentenced him to 12 months’ hard labor.
A huge petition, urging his release, is now being
prepared for presentation to the Acting-Gover-
nor, but as the Acting-Governor is the same
Chief-Justice who passed the monstrous sen-
tence, the draper’s prospects amount to very
little. Apropos, will somebody tell The
Bulletin by what means the 7th section of
the N.S. W. Charter of Justice has been ren-
dered null and void? The section in question
expressly provides that the Chief Justice shall
not occupy any other paid office whatsoever.
Despite the vigorous remonstrances of the Yic.
railway department, a number of ex-M.’sL.A.
—some of them individuals who were sacked
by their constituents long, long ago—still
refuse to give up their free railway passes. The
department, therefore, applied to the Crown
Solicitor for a high-class legal opinion as to
whether it could lay an information against any
of these individuals when found travelling on
their gold tokens, and the Crown Solicitor fur-
nished the staggering information that no pro-
ceedings could be taken unless it could be
shown that the act was done “ with intent to
defraud.” This amazingdoctrinerequires a lot of
hard thinkingover. A member’s pass is available
while he is a member and no longer. If ho
travels on it when he has ceased to he a member
then he is, so far as the ordinary lay intelli-
gence can see, a common swindler travelling on
an expired ticket and refusing to pay the legal
fare. When any ordinary, non-legislative
person does that it is f|uite needless to prove
that he does it “with intent to defraudthe
law is satisfied with the plain fact that he is
defrauding, and sends him to gaol there and
then. According to the Crown Solicitor’s
dogma, however, the ex-member may visibly
defraud the revenue as much.as he likes, pro-
viding it isn’t proved that he defrauds the
revenue with intent to defraud the revenue. And
the fact that he is defrauding the revenue, after
the most solemn warnings, is not to be taken as
sufficient evidence that he means to defraud the
revenue. Should this paper ever be charged
before a Victorian court with a clear case of
wilful murder, it proposes to set up the defence
that it can’t be legally convicted unless it is
proved that it killed the deceased with intent
that he should be dead. It is a very poor legal
opinion that won’t work at least two ways.
About the only bright idea the Australasian
Bench ever had was that the defendant should
be compelled to marry the girl. A fine example
of this eternal resolve to make him marry the
girl at all costs recently transpired in Maori-
land. Ihe defendant had been ordered to pay
7s. 6d. weekly towards.the support of his alleged
illegitimate child. He appealed to the superior
court, and for hours the hall of that august
tribunal was filled with hard and profuse swear-
ing as to the alleged paternity of the infant.
Finally, the Judge upheld the previous decision,
and decided that defendant had been guiltv of
voluminous perjury, and then defendant was
practically given the option of marrying the
girl or being prosecuted for false-swearing.'
Whether he married the girl or not this paper
doesn’t know, but the system by which a
Judge or magistrate first decides that the
defendant is a soulless and objectionable seducer
and perjurer, and then attempts to rush a
girl into becoming his partner for life, is brutal
and wholly ridiculous. Moreover, if perjury
can be condoned by marrying the girl against
whom the offence was committed, why shouldn’t
the same rule apply to other offences? The
Bulletin cordially recommends this view of
the case to the Bench’s consideration. Some
day it hopes to hear an Australian “ beak ”
deliver himself as follows: “Prisoner at the
bar, you have been found guilty of brutally
assaulting this girl, who was a complete stranger
to you, robbing her, and breaking her leg in
two places. Unless you marry her, the sentence
will be seven years’ penal servitude.” And
thereupon the prisoner will express his willing-
ness to marry her on the spot, and the case will
be dismissed with the magisterial blessing.
Premier Reid proposes to put his Civil Service
Commissioners under the thumb of the Execu-
tive Council— i.e., under the thumb of the
Ministers whose patronage they are supposed
to govern ! The plan has been tried in Queens-
land ; and the result was that, after a brief
trial of strength, the Commissioners knuckled
under to the Cabinet and became mere salaried
figureheads-which they are to this day, with
Ministerial patronage hardly checked. Reid’s
Commissioners must be able, honest men, paid
highly enough to be absolutely independent,
and responsible to Parliament only, like the
New South Wales Railway Commissioners.
The whole controversy as to re-union of the
Christian churches is hollow. The truth of the
signs of the times is that the English people,
who are slowly beginning to really govern Eng-
land, mean disestablishment of the Church of
England-mean to haul off the Old Man of
the Sea who has bestraddled the State in the
name of a theolatry which declares that the
Head of Christ’s Church on Earth is heredi-
tary ; and that the Monarch of the State
is also Pope of the Church. For, in this
little matter, there isn’t a pin to choose between
Anglicanism and Papalism. It is an even more
daring assumption to call a hereditary line of
princes and princesses heaven-born Church
Autocrats than it is to call an elected Cardinal
the Vicar of Cod. The English people are sick
of the pretensions of the “Church by Law
Established.” They groan under the burdens
laid on them by the State Pharisees and Sad-
ducees. And Romish prelates mistake the
reactionary trend of the English people against
State Churchism for an affectionate impulse
towards Rome. This is why the more shrewd
of the controversialists on their side look rather
for converts from the masses than from the theo-
logical experts of Anglicanism. Summed up,
however, these agitations are merely desperate
endeavours to stir up the ignorant into still
more ignorant emotionalism. The whole bias of
civilisation is towards agnosticism.
Editor Bulletin,—l was a steerage passen-
ger per steamer from Brisbane to Sydney the
other day. One morning, just after the watch
had been relieved at 4 o’clock, I saw the look-out
man come away from his post on the fo’c’s’le-
head. He came under the fo’c’s’le, where I
was. I asked him, “ What are you at ?” He
said, “ The mate sent me to crush holystone.”
I asked him, “Is there anyone on the look-
out ?” He said, “No; but the mate told me
he would keep a look-out.” The mate was then
on the bridge. During the voyage I saw the
three mates on many occasions take the wheel
from the men in charge, while these went away
painting and doing odd jobs. I ask you, Mr.
Editor, first, can a mate do his own duty and
that of the look-out-man or wheel-man as well ?
I ask you, secondly, whether the foregoing
facts shed any light on the numerous wrecks of
Australian passenger vessels?—E. Y. Lowry.
Moreton Frewen, in his debate with Max
Hirsch, exhibited none of that statistical lucidity
which delighted his audience at Melb. Trades’
Hall, on his first appearance in Australia. Single-
taxmen were in great force at the debate, and
howled with joy at Max’s triumphant strut across
the stage. Max’s points were mostly cotton, and
were appropriately backed by a Lancashire yell.
Poor Frewen had to face an unsympathetic audi-
ence as well as to contend with a crafty, practised
and brilliant debater.

SUNDRY SHOWS.
SYDNEY SHOWS FOR COMING WEEK.

Tiikatrb Royal “ Meir, tlie Castaway.”
Him Majesty's “ Work and Wildes.”
Tivoli Rickards' Variety Go
MELBOURNE SHOWS FOR COMING WEEK.
Princess's Tiibatrb “In Town.”
Theatre Royal “ The Span of Life.”
Opera House Rickards’ Variety Co.
Bijou F. M. Clark’s Variety Co.
Cambridge “The General” and
“ Jaunty Jane.”
At Sydney Lyceum, “ The Mountebanks ”
was revived for three nights before half-audiences.
“The Mountebanks ” is not a very attractive opera,
and last week it was no more attractive than it is.
The music is rather flat and mechanical, and the
dialogue is Gilbert’s second-best shading off into
his third-best. The only spontaneous laugh comes
when the “Put a penny in the slot ” duet is sung
by the figures of Hamlet and Ophelia with an
abundance of grotesque wooden gesture. Lauri
was last week more than usually wooden ; and Ida
Osborne (always a very valuable auxiliary) was
exhilaratingly grotesque.
* * * *
“ Madame Angot” has been doing a very
successful season at the same theatre, but as its
career ends on Friday night, a paper which doesn’t
come out until Thursday has very little encourage-
ment to spread itself on the subject. And as
“Dorothy,” which commences on Saturday night,
ends on Tuesday and this paper doesn’t come out
again till the Thursday after, there is very little
encouragement to spread itself on that subject
either. Moreover, the “Vicar of Bray,” which
follows “Dorothy,” doesn’t start till Wednesday
night, after the next issue has gone to press, and
is gone again before Saturday, so that The Bul-
letin doesn’t see any chance of making a few nice
remarks about it, and will probably pass it by
altogether. As regards “ Madame Angot,” it is
really surprising how much novelty the opera co.
contrived to get out of that rather aged produc-
tion. Misses Nellie Stewart and Florence Young,
as the two goddesses of the essentially feminine
production, managed somehow to create an im-
pression that the play was entirely new, and the
former, in a skirt which was split nearly to the
waist and a joyous revelation of tights underneath,
was a vision which could easily have filled the
Lyceum for six weeks instead of one. “ Madame
Angot” was one delirious triumph for the win-
some Nellie, and her rent skirt and her tights ;
for though the skirt of Florence Young was rent
in a similar fashion, her tights, for some unex-
plained reason, did not catch on to any great ex-
tent. Madame Emily Soldene, as Amaranthe,
the market woman, scored a riotous success in her
one good scene. Wallace Brownlow’s voice
showed to the best advantage, though otherwise
Larivaudiere seemed rather stiff and somewhat
encumbered with his own legs. Tapley, as Ange
Pitou, was a modified success, and the larking
police-agent of Arthur Lissant deserves to be re-
membered as the best make-up in the opera, and
a person whose lurk almost amounted to genius.
* * « *
The familiar “Meg, the Castaway,” now
being revived at Sydney Royal, is a play which
seems to have been built round Maggie Moore.
Maggie, with her dances and her coster song, and
her melody about the curl of baby’s hair, and her
other song, “ Won’t you be my Sweetheart ?” and
her tears and general diablerie, is the beginning,
middle and end of the show. The stolen child
and the philanthropist with his itinerant coffee-
stall, and the saveloy man, and the dog-fancier
are mere adjuncts, and nobody really cares for
them when Miss Moore is about. All these mis-
cellaneous parts are well filled, so far as The Bul-
tktin can remember, but it doesn’t really matter
much whether they are well filled or not. The
pathos of the drama is rather cheap and doggy at
times, and the atmosphere of Shoreditch or
Whitechapel is not particularly cheerful, and
“ Meg,” as a whole, is pervaded by a faint aroma
of pig’s-trotters and two-penn’orth of gin, but,
despite all these circumstances, the revival is a
success—or ought to be, which is the same thing.
On further consideration, however, this paper
decides that it isn’t the same thing or anything
distantly resembling it.
# * * *
“ Work and Wages ” still booms very
cheerfully at Her Majesty's (Sydney), and the
public evidently likes it. The Bulletin, how-
ever, hasn’t quite decided whether it shares this
sentiment or not. Meanwhile, several things
strike it forcibly, in addition to the things which
struck it last week. One is the fact that almost
every act ends with a girl rushing out and point-
ing the finger of haggard denunciation at the
real criminal. Another is that the murderous
foreigner seems to escape from prison in each
act, and nobody ever attempts to recapture
him. Its opinion of the villain’s mental
capacity has fallen heavily since last week
through further consideration of that black-
hatted monstrosity. The villain has two wives,
and being anxious to marry a third one, with
i 525,000 a year, he intends to “ remove ” the first,
and to prove that the second is not his wife,
because at the time of their marriage the first was
still living. If the second lady makes trouble,
however, he intends to prove that she is his wife,
the first marriage having been illegal. Obviously
in one case he will be “jugged ” for bigamy, and
in the other he will be handicapped with a visible
wife, who will be a serious obstacle in the way of
his new marriage, so that he is a very dull
and wooden villain at the best. Also, The
Bulletin seriously urges Mr. Rignold to
do something with the trial scene. The
spectacle of Paul Radford being convicted
because a man, who isn’t sworn and doesn’t give
his name, rashes in with an alleged certificate,
which isn’t even attested, setting forth that Adele
Langlois, who is dead and nob very clearly
identified, was married to Geoffry Armadale,
whom nobody attempts to prove is Paul Radford,
is very much mixed. Also, the accused’s left eye
is out of drawing, and the lawyer’s statement
that the chief witness couldn’t possibly own the
bloodstained knife because his name is on it looks
illogical, and the trial isn’t a fair one owing to
the blank and awful imbecility of the prisoner’s
counsel, who has a retreating chin and a watery
eye and a forehead that goes backwards as sud-
denly as the Federation movement. Lastly, it is
an obvious mistake to turn the limelight on Mr,
Sweeney, the limelight being intended for Mr.
Rignold only. The management is _ cordially
invited to sit down somewhere on a quiet moun-
tain-side and think over these obvious discrep-
ancies.
* * * *
Mr. Livingston Hopkins (The Bulletin’s
own particular “ Hop.”) will shortly take a vaca*
tion of two or three months, during which he
intends lecturing all round Australia, the well-
known and popular L. J. Lohr being manager of the
establishment. This more or less ill-assorted pair
will commence in Melbourne some time next
month, probably at the Athenaeum Hall. “Hop.,”
who is already tolerably well-known as a humorous
lecturer and writer, as well as an artist, will
illustrate his own lectures, the pictures—-mostly
colored —being reproduced by a process of his own,
which will avoid all necessity for suspending pro-
ceedings while the lecturer has a hurried dis-
agreement with the lantern-man, after the
manner of the gifted Blathwayt. “ Hop.”
wishes it to bo distinctly understood that
he isn’t going for his health, nor for the
express purpose of conferring a blessing on the
public, nor because he supposes the public
is yearning to hear him. The great mass of the
public, he is fully aware, not having yet heard
him, doesn't care a straw whether it hears him or
not, but after it has once heard him, it will begin
to want to hear him very badly indeed. One
principal object of his tour is to see every
important person and every person who isn’t
important but thinks he is, and gather up
information for future use; and, apart from
that, Mr. Livingston H. is going lecturing
because it darned well pleases him to do so.
He pledges himself not to appear on the platform
with a johnny stick, nor to say “haw,” nor to
allude to any monarchs that have had the honor
of meeting him, nor to tell any of Talraage’s old
jokes, nor to attempt to discourse upon a fiddle
that is manifestly beyond his powers. And with
these good resolutions he goes forth confidently,
his confidence being tempered only by a fear that
the man who is entrusted in his absence with the
job of drawing Parkes may make a mess of that
statesman’s mane, and thus bring discredit on this
valuable and widely-read paper.

Mr. Frederick Yilliers, the talented war-
artist, lately from the scene of the Jap-Chow war,
was advertised to open at Sydney Centenary Hall
on Wednesday, and will be duly considered in
next issue. Also, Messrs. York and Jones’s
minstrels commence a season at Sydney Opera
House on Monday.

’Arry Rickards returned to Sydney Tivoli
a few days ago after an absence of ten months,
and was received with a storm of applause which
nearly blew the back wall out of the building.
The returned favourite sang all through the evening
more or less, until his voice threatened to gi ve out,
whereupon his enthusiastic admirers at last left off
encoring, though with extreme reluctance. “Me
an’ ’Er—’Er an’ Me” took especially well, but the
present writer takes serious exception to the
allegation in one of Mr. Rickards’ other songs :
“To err is human ; to forgive divine.” After
hearing the gifted Blathwayt “ er ” and “haw”
for a whole evening, he hereby records his convic-
tion that to “er” is absolutely inhuman, and
should be made a capital offence, and to forgive
the man who says “ er ” is merely encouraging sin.
* * * *
“In Town,” at Melb. Princess’s, has ful-
filled its first night’s promise. This festive show is
very generally preferred to the daintier thing which
paved the way for it, and Louis Brad field has
caught an admiring city by the wool. Neverthe-
less, The Bulletin’s present opinion remains
faithful to “ A Gaiety Girl,” in which there was
no special “star” part, or resurrectionary effect.
Mr. Brad field is a breezy caricature of an insol-
vent (printed “insolent” in last issue) captain,
and an artist with several sides to his talent. But
when Duchess Phelps tells him to say “Your
Grace,” and he —the supposed man about town-
replies “Pm not hungry,” Bradfield is not
humorous. At such moments, he is merely a
burlesque laugh-maker, heaving the old reliable
gags at poor untutored savages. Miss Deoima
Moore and Charles Ryley do a good deal for “ In
Town ” without getting lavishly rewarded for
their trouble. Ryley, who is said to be in ill-
health, sings accordingly, yet his gentle represen-
tation of the duke is a finished piece of work. He
has a paternal affection for Miss Decima, and
when that dear little creature discovers that he is
quite harmless in his pursuit, and acknowledges
his kindness to her beat Johnnie by letting the
old gent kiss her maiden brow, the touch of nature
makes the whole male congregation kin with Duke
Ryley.
# • *
Miss Florence Lloyd, as the duke’s son, is
also a bright, convincing young fellow, whose
image lingers in one’s memory after the curtain
falls, likewise the call-boy (Kaye) deserves a
paean of praise for his strong rendering of a
feeble song. Moat of the songs are feeble,
but two of them have choruses that the audience
can’t understand, and, as somebody remarks
during the evening, an unintelligible chorus never
fails. Miss Palotta has now adopted a skirt
instead of tights, but the tapering extremities of
Miss Maud Hobson were still in evidence at time
of writing. Otherwise Miss Hobson is not
worthily displayed by her small character,
although the fact that she is actually there playing
“principal boy” at the Ambiguity Theatre, and
can’t meet a certain tall gentleman at the stage-
door, “ because her husband has unexpectedly
returned, and she will have to go home that even-
ing”—well, the fact is of vast importance. Mel-
bourne loves her under any circumstances. She is
a sort of human Naples. Yon see her, and die-
having taken a look at Miss Blanche Massey in
the sweet meantime. “In Town ” was originally
billed for a 12-nights run, but it seems to have got
the lease extended. “The Shop Girl” may not
be wanted just yet.
* * *
“ The Span of Life ” has achieved a fifth
week at the Royal, and probably thinks of retir-
ing soon. It is a wonderful drama as regards
plot, dialogue, scenery, and sublime impossibility
all round, but it can’t last for ever. Besides,
Bland Holt has some more dramas waiting round
the corner, ready to knock creation when he gives
the signal.

Melbourne Bijou, under the direction of
Frank Clark, put forward a hybrid variety show
on Saturday evening. Two stage Irishmen rushed
up to the circular quay at Monte Carlo, in a
gondola, and sang comic songs. The local popu-
lation also sang, and there was something
described as a Blizzard by way of a climax to the
first part. The next part was neither better, nor
much worse, than could be expected, and the
clever gymnast, Ouda, brought proceedings to a
close. A welcome strip of carpet has been laid
down in the Bijou’s noisy corridor, and the public
are tempted by pot-plants and music to go forth
and refresh themselves during the interval, and
the appearance of the corridor on Saturday sug-
gested that the new entertainment was of a
nature to create a strong thirst.
»* * *
At Melb. Opera House the Rickards Co.
flourishes. The infallible Pope, with his colored
colleague, the riotous Sayles, is back again after
a sufficiently long absence. The Sakers, ventrilo-
quist Winton, and numerous other “turns” give
the usual quantity of unparalleled delight. Any
misguided performer who doesn’t give pleasure to
all is promptly suppressed by a wise management.
A new double bill at the little Cambridge
Theatre shows signs of weakness in its hind-
quarters, and the time when this pluckily-con-
ducted establishment will get crowded to the
doors is still in the dim future. In fact,
the Cambridge audiences seem to wax smaller
by degrees. All the same, D’Arcy Stanfield
has hopes of working up a fine business. He
has produced several cheerful comedies in bright
style, and fairly assumes that they ought to serve
as good advts. Arthur Garner is suspected of an
intention to re-open the Alexandra, and the Esty-
Marsh concerts are suffering from neglect. Only
a big name will fill the Town Hall nowadays.
Concerts contain too much walking up and down
stairs and not enough music.
** * *
The Germans of Melb. are preparing for a
grand production of Wagner’s “Lohengrin.”
Either Mr. Laver or Prof. Marshall-Hall will
conduct, and some new singers will make their
appearance. The tenor will be taken by W,
Graupner—brother of the piquant Flo.—who is
said to possess a marvellous tenor voice. The bass
will be Mr. W, Dunlop, who sang so brilliantly
at the Town Hall concert on May 4. “ The Prof-
fessor ” has an immense idea of the vocal powers
of the last-mentioned, and asserts that he has at
last discovered a bass competent to sing Wagner,
for whose music a singer must possess the double
range, bass and baritone. Madame Wiedermann
will sing Elsa’s part. The opera will be produced
either at the Princess’ or the Bijou, for one night
only.

The second annual f£te and tea-fight in aid
of the Distressed Actors’ Fund will be held in
Melbourne before the month is out. The Gaiety
ladies have consented to sell refreshments, button-
holes, &0., on this occasion, and a scheme for turn-
ing their lovely presence to the best possible
account is in course of construction. Every person
who wishes to get a fair look at one or more act-
resses will be supplied with the opportunity to do
so without any attendant risk of being trampled
under foot. It is understood that tickets, entitling
the purchaser to one bun and a smile, will be sold
at the entrance to the tent. Any person lingering
long at the counter will be charged extra or
chucked out. The scheme, which is somewhat as
stated, has been founded on the experience of last
year, when there was a terrible anxiety to get into
each tent, and comparatively little money got out
of it. Apart from the beauty portion of the show,
there will be a bigger, brighter and more varied
entertainment than last year’s. The Distressed
Actors’ Fund is a deserving matter. It is the sole
support of the Dramatic and Musical Association
since the banks busted, and during the past 12
months the fund has dispensed some hundreds of
pounds in the best kind of charity—cash down,
and nothing said about it outside of the board-
room. The chairman of the fund (J. C. William-
son) objects to any publication of the names of
people who receive assistance. That’s good.
At Poverty Point,
Male Sydney is jealous of Joe Tapley. No other actor
on the Australian stage ever had such a chance of kissing
and hugging Nellie Stewart.
The beauteous Ryley is never heard of in Melb. feinale-
d m since the bounding, beatific Bradfield rose, sunlike,
on the Princess’s horizon. But the lively Louis is already
married, and has his wife (a non-professional lady) with
him.
Louis Bradfleld is pretty well assured of Fred. Leslie’s
place and pay in the Gaiety Co. on his return to “ Town.”
George Edwardes has secured his services till ’9B.
The distressed actors of Melbourne are to be aided by
another theatrical shivoo, which has been fixed to take
place a day or two before the Gaiety girlhood leaves for
Sydney. The dudetings parted with willing half,
sovereigns for the Nellie Stuart smile and the Vi. Varley
bun. What quantity of gold will they not part with for a
Decima Moore mash or a Hobson handshake?
Ada Crossley, whose London d6but is early this Jmonth,
said in a recent letter to a Mel'b.-girl: ‘‘There is only one
contralto in London of whom lam afraid. She is Clara
Butt. The people here imagine she cannot be eclipsed.
She is a great favorite of the Queen’s, consequently
everyone swears by her.”
Ethel Haydon is coming on, writes Tub Bulletin’s Lon-
don correspondent, but she still suffers from the effect of
her comparatively poor d6but on the first night of “ Dick
Whittington.” May Yoh4 is no longer jealous of her
supposed rival. Had Ethel not been so unuuly puffed in
advance she would have made a very good impression.
Grace Palotta’s trim little figure in “ In Town,” is a joy
to be remembered fondly. She is a rounded, plump,
elegantly-moulded little thing in blue tights and close-
fitting bodice, as perfectly shaped as a sculptor’s ideal
figurette, and as lively on the stage as a dragon-fly in a
sunbeam. There is no resisting the fascination of her
broken English—except by those who think with the
humorless spouse of a Toorak magnate that " the little
gal would be all right if she could speak plain.”
In her dance in “In Town,” Madge Rossell wears a
dress of the color of cigarette-smoke, a blueish grey. It
is entirely appropriate to the dance, a curling, spiral,
cloudy movement, in which the dancer curves her lithe
body in the most gracefully lissome manner, and floats
round the stage like a “light cloud of cigarette smoke
puffed from some wizard’s mouth.”
The dress worn by Maud Hobson, in “ In Town,” is like
nothing in the world but a big bruise. And yet it ia
beautiful in spite of, or perhaps because of, its daring.
The skirt is of blue silk, with a bodice of yellow velvet
with bands of black silk ribbon and black lace. And a
coquettish blue-and-biack hat set jauntily on the masses
of golden fair hair completes a most fetching picture.
Verily the fair Maud, with her diamond-studded black
velvet collar, knows how to show off all her many and
various charms to best advantage.
There is one particular in which the present Gaiety Co.
is immeasurably superior to Lonnen’s. VVe miss the man
in the “ leary ” clothes, covered with black braid and
pearl buttons, who stood in the limelight, and with con-
torted face and voice, inflicted “coster” songs on a
suffering audience. If for nothing else but this, Monk-
house and Co. deserve big houses.
Editor Bulletin. Sir,— Re the statement in “ Poverty
Point ” that I am engaged to Mr. Hope, kindly allow me
to state that there is no truth in the rumor. —Yours,
Florence Lloyd. Princess Theatre, Melb., 11th May.
H.: “This ‘ln Town’ is amazingly clever, but I can
never fathom the delight that actors, and especially act-
resses, take in vilifying the stage.”

A BEAUTIFUL COMPLEXION.
It has long been known to scientists that for
improving the appearance and beautifying the
face oatmeal is far and away superior to all other
foods, but it had one drawback—the tendency to
heat the blood. To overcome this defect the at-
tention of eminent scientists has been devoted to
the removal of this imperfection ; and now, after
long years of careful and diligent research, art has
triumphed, and Uncle Toby’s Boiled Oats is the
result, for, by skilful manipulation in the manu-
facture, all the heating properties have been ex-
tracted, so that now a beautiful complexion of
peach and ivory may b'e had by anyone who makes
a continuous use of Uncle Toby’s Boiled Oats.
The Wild-Cat Column .
The A.M.P. Society has done well during the
past year, audit would have ( primafaoie) done a good
deal better but for its commendable resolve to provide in
advance for possible losses through the “depression.”
the directors have resolved to set aside £225,000 to cover
anticipated depreciation in Uie value of securities. Tins
makes a total reserve for this purpose of £414,000. Pos-
sibly, it may be found necessary to set aside further
amounts with the same end in view in succeeding years, hut
the matter is one which need trouble policy-holders little.
Despite all deductions, the net profits continue large,
and the A.M.P. still pays—and, to all appearance, will
continue to pay—the largest bonuses in Australia. When
all imaginable depreciation is provided for, and no further
provision is required for this purpose, the bonuses should
grow still larger, and it is always possible that a general
revival may enhance values and make the present reserves
altogether unnecessary. In any case, the directors do
well to make allowance for every contingency. Besides
the above reserves, £14,000 has been written off the value
of office premises, £25,000 set aside to provide for any
future reduction of interest on investments, and £15,001)
for other purposes ; and after all these deductions the
magnificent profit of £431,837 remains to be divided
among policy-holders as the result of the year’s opera-
tions.
The A.M.P.’s premium income for ’94 equals
£1.270,000, and the receipts from interest on investments
£699,000. The total revenue was £28,000 more than
last year, and £480,000 has been added to the accumu-
lated funds, making a grand total of £12,435,240 on hand.
The invested funds yielded £5 11s. lOd. per cent., and
seeing that the society only* estimates a yield of £3 15s.
per cent., the margin is very large indeed. The expenses,
which, in 1892, had reached the apparently irreducible
minimum of 9i per cent, on the total receipts, have now
been reduced to BJ, and apparently a further diminution
may be looked for. In two or three years from now, when
all the necessary reserves have been provided for depre-
ciation, reduction in the estimated rate of interest, £.c.,
the A.M.P. should be able to increase its bonus to a
figure which will break its famous 1892 record. Mean-
while, the results, despite the present transition state
of things, are all that could reasonably he expected.
The A.M.P.’s balance-sheet, which, up to a
year ago, contained about as little real information as
such a document could well give, is now drawn up on
the lines which The Bulletin has suggested with much
reiteration for a good many months past. For the
first lime it shows separately mortgage interest accrued,
mortgage interest overdue and in arrears (these items
seem'hitherto to have been lumped in with the mort-
gages), premiums due but on which the days of grace
have not yet expired, and premiums in arrear. The
result on the whole is satisfactory, and the comparatively
small amount of interest actually in arrear should do
much to dispel certain unpleasant rumors whose existence
was largely owing to the policy of dignified reticence
which the A.M.P.—in common with most other offices—
adopted in these matters.

Two facts stand out more conspicuously than
the rest among Premier Reid’s financial proposals. One
is that the year 1894 closed with an acknowledged
deficiency of £27l,Bo2—besides another which is not
acknowledged as the first result of Mr. Reid’s financing.
Tim other is that the half-year which ends next month is
likely to close with a deficiency of £240,000, and that Mr.
Reid's alleged surplus of £106,000 is arrived at by about
the most foolish and impudent juggle on record. The
estimated revenue for the half-year is £240,000 less I ban
the expenditure. Therefore, the Premier has delved
among the finances of past years, and discovered certain
items, amounting to £345,700, which his predecessors
paid out of revenue, but which, lie alleges, should have
been paid out of loan moneys instead. Why any amount
should he charged to loans if the Treasurer can pay it out
of revenue passes comprehension, but, without explain-
ing this, Mr. Reid shifts these ancient items into the loan
account and takes £345,700 of loan moneys, which he
puts into the receipts for the current half-year. Also, he
professes to regard this sum as money just received in
the ordii ary way, and this alleged addition will presently
he quoted as an example of how the public income
expands under the blessed influences of Free-raid.
The gall of this device is unique. Mr. Reid’s
predecessors found the money to pay certain liabilities
out of revenue ; the transaction is over and done with,
and Premier Reid simply borrows £345,700 and puts it
into current revenue, and feebly disguises the fact by
saving that it wasn’t he but his pr-decessors who bor-
rowed it. Last year, according to his own figures, the
Reid deficiency was £271,800. It was really £487,000, hut
the Premier charged £216,000 of his own expenditure
to ills predecessor’s accounts in 1893. This half-year
he has a shortage of £240,000, but lie charges that also to
his predecessors, and it is from them also that he gets ids
surplus of £106,000. The grim reality is that Premier
Reid tins gone £727,000 to the bad in 18 months, but has
disguised the fact by annexing revenue from his dead and
gone political ancestors, and by charging expenditure to
those who have gone before him. The deficiency is to be
shuffled offi in the good old way, by borrowing £1,200,000
or thereabouts, and passing the burden on to posterity.
Every N.S.W. financier does the same old, old shuffle, and
the burden is always handed down to that patient ass,
posterity, in the same fashion.
The country now awaits with considerable
interest Mr. Reid’s third financial statement. His first
and second have been characterised by the same bright
and original “ fake,” and as the habit of juggling with
accounts grows upon one, like rum, and opium-eating,
and other bad habits, the next budget will probably be
managed in the same fashion. Probably, in course of
time, the Premier will be found charging current expen-
diture to forgotten Treasurers of 40 or 50 years ago, or
else taking credit as current revenue for money which was
paid away in the time of B igh or Hunter, or some other
of the early fathers of the piovince. Nearly every Trea-
gurer on record lias faked the accounts more or less—
generally more—but G. H. Reid’s mode of faking is
altogether new, so far as The Bulletin is aware.

That big and ancient institution, the Bank of
New South Wales, keeps progressing at a time when
most ottier institutions of the kind show a downward
tendency. The gross profit for Uie half-year is £90,260,
against £88,600 for the previous half, and the same divi-
dend of 9 per cent, is declared. The note circulation has
increased by £21,000, and the deposits by £159,000. The
paid-up capital has expanded by £51,000, and the pre-
miums thereon (£l3 882) have gone to swell the reserve-
fund, which now stands at £1,158,000. Coin, bullion, and
cash balances have grown by £850,000, and now reach the
anormous figure of £5,724,000, in addition to £BOO,OOO in
Government and other debentures, and £255,000 in other
realisable securities, making nearly £7,000,000 of imme-
liately available reserves. In every possible respect the
B.N.S.W. shows increased solidity, and its steady pro-
gress, at such a time as the present, is a remarkable proof
of soundness and good management.

The Viqj Insolvency Commission has elicited
that the large sums usually charged to estates by trade
ussignees for "clerical assistance,” “messengers,” and
the like, are simply perquisites of the assignee, and that
tn the great bulk of cases only a fraction of the amounts
to charged are paid for the purposes stated. It is also
Interesting to learn that it is a recognised thing for
assignees to “ whack ” the 5 per cent, commission with
the highly-respectable merchants who put the estate in
the assignee’s way ; but the most damning thing given
in evidence is the allegation that certain firms have occa-
sionally been allowed to prove for much larger sums than
the insolvent really owes, with the result that the little
creditor gets (sa) r ) his ss. in the £ only, but the big one
gets ss. on the actual amount owed, and an additional
fliv. at the same rate on the fictitious debt 1

One or two Vic. trade assignees are trem-
bling in their boots as to the result of the evidence
which the Inso'vency Commission now sitting, extracted

The Bulletin wants to know why nearly all
the most, startling evidence given before Vic. Insolvency
Commission as to crooked practices of trade assignees has
been omitted from the news reports? Also, why the
interesting items re the lawyers' pickings out of insol-
vent estates are not published. Despite all the proofs
of wholesale plunder by certain trade assignees and their
pals, the lawyers, the former profess no fear as to effectual
remedial legislation resulting. As one of them remarked,
“Trust Uie host of lawyers in Parliament to look after
themselves and us.”

Out of 120 Vic. trade assignees called to furnish
full accounts of their stewardships, 40 odd have failed to

It is most likely that Vic. trade assignees in the
future will become officers of the Court, and will have to
find security for the amount of the assets in every estate
that falls into their hands. This is sure to wipe out the
very few honest little trade assignees and cause the big
ones to become more bloated than ever.

The Queensland loan of ,£1,250,000 at 3£ per
cent, has realised an average of £lOl 12s. 7d., and “ ex-
penses,” which are a variable quantity, will probably re-
duce it to a little over par. Its purpose is to redeem an
old 6 percent. loan of £765,600, and £500,000 worth of 4
per cent. Treisury bills, both due Ist January, 1896. The
province nominal!)' saves by the conversion £21,586 per
annum in interest, which isn’t much of a feat, for in the
present state of the money-market even the blundering
Treasurer Nelson could hardly avoid making the saving.
Meanwhile, however, the loan has been floated about
nine months before it was needed, so Queensland loses
£32,000 in interest while the money is lying idle. Pre-
sumably it will tie deposited in the Q.N. Bank in the
interim, and when once Queensland public funds get into
the Q.N. Bank they have such a strange and dreadful
tendency to be left there that this circumstance alone is
depressing. Two other things are worth noting : (1) The
Government has already £4,390,000 in that bank, and
as £2,220,000 is said to he “ free,” and the loan to be re-
deemed only amounted to about half that sum, there
seems to be no reason which can bear public inspection
why there should be any loan at all. And (2), in the
general whoop about the “success” of the new loan,
hardly anyone seems to notice how Nelson’s chronic
deficit was first turned into Treasury hills, and how the
Treasury Hills are now being turned into permanent debt,
and tiow the burden is being once more shunted on to our
good old friend, posterity.

nett profit, hut the amount available (profit, £90.642, and

Collins is arriving in London, and the new manager, Mr.
O. 0. Warnford Locke, is here. Xus Bulletin would like
to bet Locke a hat that he won’t turn out two more ton*
of gold in the time.

Bendigo Coolgardie Co. open to crush for .£2 a
ton, 50 ton lots. More money in that than in the mine.

The Lily claim, near White Feather, floated in
London for £90,000 —so say the local papers. The pro-
moters hold out great inducements to the shareholders in
the way of divs. No doubt they will keep their word if
they find a reef containing enough gold.
* * * *
The Londonderry catastrophe was even more
horrible than indicated by the first cable. One end of
the cut or golden bole was already down to the clay seam
or floor where the gold cut out. As soon as it commenced
to rise from the 50ft. cross-cuts the gold vanished there,
too, and only went down a few feet in a short streak.
Had the original owners fired one more shot it would have
cost them a lug part of £180,000! Heaven is sometimes
kind to poor old Australia.

gardie! !! Where is Warden Finnerty I lie hold? And
what are other mines going to do for round timber after
Stem’s order is satisfied ? Other people use sawn timber
and save the poor forest.

Struck Oil, near Mt. Morgan, is still forging
ahead, employing something like 150 men, and beginning
to promise a permanent thing. The much-boosted Mt.
Victoria, in the same district, is about to commence work
with some 50 hands in a week or two.

Samples from the Easter Gift, 15 miles S.W. of

Lady Loch, Coolgardie—“ Reef 3ft. thick, show-
ing a little gold ; expect it to make bigger and better (of
course). Fixed condenser, which is working splendidly.
Have over lOOOgals. fresh water.” Great Scott! Just
imagine a mine with lOOOgals. fresh water and a condenser
working splendidly ! !

Barry’s Coolgardie Co. has just been floated in
London. The lease is close to the Perseverance, at Han-
nan’s, and has, or had, a very nice shoot of gold. Con-
cerning its present prospects there is a little uncertainty.

Gyrnpie crushiners for May were 8509 tons for
77980 z.. paving £l6 250 divs. The Plimnix paid £8750 ;
IN. Southfield, £4BOO ; and IN. Glanmire ,£lBOO. There
has been an all-round fall in stocks, and no particularly
promising development.

The Empress of Coolgardie (floated in London
by Z b Lane, for his syndicate) is now putting through
its first crushing of 200 tons. The manager expects the
stone to go 4oz.—very modest?for Cook'ardie. The mine
wO'ild need to turn out well, as the Empress is the only
mouse which the syndicate mountain has brought forth
in its 18 months of existence.

Menzies’ Find settlement is on a low, scrubby
flat, with a heavy deposit of fine dust. Is should make a
fruitful fever-bed next summer. The main street con-
tains about 50 offices of wood and canvas, in some of
which the “best brands” of neck-lubrication are con-
stantly in stock. The cost of living is £1 15s. per week,
and wages-men get from £3 10s. to £4.

Re Fermoy (Q.) opal mines. One buyer in
March last bought £lOOO worth of opal. Men sink down
15ft. until they get into what is called “pipe opal”—a
valuable kind which can be worked up into bars. The
country is, however, very patchy.

Ex-Mayor Thompson, of Ballarat, has floated
the Working Miners’ claim, Homehush, on London
market ; hut he did not get the terms originally de-
manded He is sanguine that tie will also float in Eng-
land the Prince of Wales and Old Poverty Co.’s mine,
Tarnagulla. This claim has turned out some tons of gold.

The Central Queensland Gold-Mining Proprie-
tary, possessing about 1300 acres of freehold and lease-
hold, including a number of quartz-reefs, ironstone lodes,
and some more or less rich alluvial ground, has
determined to raise working capital in England.
The trustees have secured independent reports
throng!) the Port Curtis Chamber of Commerce. Q.,
supplemented with a certificate from the A.J.S. Bank
showing the amount of alluvial gold already taken out.
The latter totals up to the not insignificant figure of
28h.0000z., and it is alleged that a scheme of hydraulic
sluicing, gold-dredging, and quartz-crushing-involving
an outlay of £60,000 for machinery—on hulk stuff averag-
ing a pennyweight or two to the load, will return some-
thing like £6OOO per week —certainly a big order. Those
who get in on the ground floor of the original Proprietary
shares (£5) should do well enough.

The mammoth providoring establishment at the

departments-a gentlemen’s hair-dressing saloon, which
will start with a complement of about 20 hands.

Melbourne’s biggest universal providers employ
1066 hands, to be reinforced after additions to premises
now in progress. Despite the depression, last year’s turn-
over was the biggest on record. The concern has dealt
out death and destruction to the smaller traders.

The Bulletin’s London correspondent by last
mail: ‘‘Londonderry’s, which were faked to a premium of
10s. to 15s. on the strength of some supposed Paris buy-
ing, suddenly slumped to 14s. in one act. On the reports
of the French deal speculators bought, hoping to unload
at the expense of the unsophisticated foreigner, but they
found themselves landed, as Mr. Myring’s deal was solely
for the sale of vendors’ shares, of which there are more
than a couple of hundred thousand to be got rid of. So it
will always be until the ’Derry is proved by results to be
something more than a mere pocket. Whenever the
promoters and underwriters try to get out, down go the
shares —and quite right, too, for a more barefaced grab
never was known. Had North, Pingall and Myringbeen
contented with a reasonable profit, and made the capital
even £400,000, the shares would now be marketable at a
good premium. As it is, the mine hangs round the neck
of the market like an old man of the sea. It is rumored
that the ’Derry has collapsed.”

Dr. J. ASHBURTON THOMPSON, of
Sydney.
Matthew Davies is getting an occasional
s’ice of Melb. Divorce Court business. Last week
he appeared for a co-respondent in a case where
the petition was dismissed with costs.
Rose, M.P., who thrust his knife into
Sydney’s big brewers last week, was a Parramatta

There are probably only two men in South
Australia who sign themselves “J. Langdon.”
Oae is editor Bonython, the other Parsons ; one
the defendant, the other the plaintiff in the S.A.
libel-action.
Cardinal Moran and Arthur Galton, both
practically new-chums, regard themselves as
most competent of authorities on early Australian
history, each being especially eulogistic of the
other’s fitness for writing in that field.
Henry Gyles Turner, manager of the
Commercial Bank of Australia, is getting on
with his “History of Australia.” He has a
remarkable library of Australian books, the collec-
tion of which has been a hobby with him for years.
Miss Edith Walker,
tiie Sydney millionairess

wealthiest woman in
Australasia and is worth
two solid millions of
sovereigns) supports a

The lately-deceased
John Buckley was not
once of the Bank of Vic-
toria, as the Argus said
in its mortuary notice.
It was of the Bank of
Australasia that he was
paying teller, during the
Fifties. From there he
migrated to Dalgety’s
firm, when Andrew Rose
Cruikshank was Melb.
managing partner of Dal-
vety, Cruikshank & Co.
There is a woman at the
bottom of all men’s
movements, according to
Talleyrand, and so with
Buckley’s movementfrom
Vic. to Europe in '6l.
He had been crossed in
1 >ve by one of the Joshua
Bros, of that time, and
for 20 years kept out of
Melb,, and remained a

Grizzly-featured Wolseley, of machine
sheep-shearing fame, and brother of “the first

The Marchioness of Ripon presented, at
Queen Victoria’s Drawing Room, Mrs. Ward,

Sydney Daily Telegraph credits Rev.
Haweis as being the pioneer champion of Pontius
Pilate !—whereas he is, of course, about the ten-
thousand-and-oneth. Mr. Haweis mostly runs in
well-trodden tracks, but, wearing pointed high
heels, he leaves new impressions.
“ Honor thy father.” This is used as an
excuse for sons and sons-in-law practising before
“the old man” in Australian courts. By the
way, a solicitor who appeared before his father, a
N.S. Wales magistrate, the other day, amused
the court by inadvertently blurting out : “But,
pa, that’s not in the statute !”
The defaulting law-clerk, who was last
week sentenced to three years’ imprisonment, left
Melbourne under the name of “ Dudley Brookes.”
Even the danger of his position could not induce
him to choose a common, unostentatious cognomen
like Smith or Brown. There are some people who
would rather be dead than ordinary.
An old native of the Hawkesbury, Mr.
W. T. Price, died recently at Richmond. Mrs.
Price thus becomes a widow for the fourth time.
Her third husband was Mr. Benjamin Isaacs, per-
haps the first printer to take a press and plant
over the Blue Mountains, where he conducted for
years the Bathurst Advocate in the forties.
Whatever professedly denominational
newspapers may do, the Australian Star should
give over loading its “ leader ” columns with such
expressions as “the Lord Bishop of Goulburn.”
There is no such Australian title; there is no
such person as the title would indicate ; and, as
poor Don Lane used to say, “ There’s no such
thing.”
A Protectionist member of N.S.W. Assem-
bly, whose “ effusions ” have appeared regularly
for years past in the Protectionist organ of his
district, is compiling a volume of his versicles for
book publication. Most of the pieces begin with
“Oh, dear me!” or “ Oh, my!” and if not care-
fully edited will, it is rumored, go far to kill Pro-
tection in Australia.
The Bulletin this week prints the por-
trait of Dr. J. Ashburton Thompson, of Sydney,
who has been awarded a 50-guinea prize by the
committee of the Father Damien Memorial Fund
in recognition of his leprosy-researches. Dr.
Thompson is the chief executive officer of the
N.S.W. Health Department, one of the most
enlightened, energetic, and best-managed Aus-
tralian bureaux.
Poor old Q.C., M.L.C. Solomon, of Suva’
Fiji, will be greatly missed. A peculiarity of his
was to tell a story to anybody he could buttonhole.
He used to repeat the same old yarns over and
oyer, and if the unwilling listener protested or
hinted that he fancied he had heard him tell it
before, the old chap would say “Did I? Well,
I’ll tell it you again for practice.”
Recently died at Westwood, near Rock-
hampton, Wm. Kelman, one of the best-known
of C.Q. pioneers. In 1854 Kelman took up
country on the Dawson and the Isaacs; afterwards
founded Meteor Downs station (near Springsure)
and Glenormiston, on the Queensland-South Aus-
tralian border. Went down in the financial
troubles of ’B6 and ’94, and, game to the last, left
for Ooolgardie, where illness and poverty broke
him down. Returned lately to C.Q. and died at
Westwood —a poor man, who, thirty years ago,
could ride 150 miles in a straight line through his
own territory.

A S.A. Wesleyan parson holds a unique
record. Five years ago he, then a parson and
temperance lecturer, made a fortune in Broken
Hills and left “the vineyard.” He invested much
money in a brewery, but failed, and was for awhile
a clerk to the eo. that bought the business. Re-
cently he was re-admitted to the church, and he is
now a humble divine up Ooolgardie way.
Henry Gyles Turner, appearing as a wit-
ness in the Farrar case at Melbourne Insolvency
Court, was asked by Purves, Q.C., if he had ever
told a lie intentionally. Turner replied, “Not of
late years.” This ought to be tidings of comfort
and joy for Commercial Bank depositors. Also,
the bank ought to announce itself as under the
management of George Washington Redivivus,
Mr. Justice Simpson, the last-appointed
N.S.W. Supreme Court Judge, has, it is said,
signified that he does not wish his son to practise
before him. The other Judges might well follow
the example of their youngest brother, and so
avoid the rude, but effective, interference of the
Legislature. Apropos, the late Mr. Justice Moles-
worth (Vic.) virtually declined to let his son prac-
tise in his Court.
The hand-shaking sustained by Gov. Hope-
toun in good-byeing the Melbourneites resulted in
a bad time for H. E. all the way to Colombo.
Through the mad squeeze of the crowd, a ring on
the gubernatorial little finger was so bent and
pressed into the flesh that it was with difficulty
removed, and then not until it had caused a
nasty laceration which, all through the voyage,
remained greatly inflamed.
Cosmo Newbery, the Melb. analyst who
died the other day, in his time was an expert wit-
ness in many most notable criminal cases. One
was that of Reynolds, the Queen-st. (Melb.)
engineer, who found an infernal machine awaiting
him at his office one morning and was killed by
the explosion. An ex-member of the Prince
Edward Island Parliament was tried for the
murder of Reynolds; but acquitted.
Judge Harding is continually astonishing
the Bananalanders by his eccentricities. The
other day, at Rockhampton, he told a poor o'd
deaf prisoner named Spencer that his deafness
was assumed, and accused the unfortunate man,
who suffers from a weakness in the facial nerves,
of making grimaces at the court. The jury showed
their opinion of the Judge by bringing in a ver-
dict in direct opposition to his Honor’s summing-
up.
Hone Heke, M.H.R. (M.L.), has at his
native place, Kaikohe, Bay of Islands, a suit of
armour presented to his great grand-uncle by
King William IV. “ for services rendered to Capt.
Sadler, of H.M.S. Buffalo,” in 1833. With the
armour was a letter from the Earl of Aberdeen
(shown to the writer by Hone Heke), in which he
says: “The King, my master, desires that you
will accept a suit of armour, such as was worn in
former days by his warriors, but which now
only used by his own body-guard.” The letter is
dated from the Colonial Office, London, Feb., ’35.
The White Knight will be effluxed by
time from his lofty billet as Chairman of
Melb. Board of Works on the last of this month,
and if re-elected (which is almost certain) must
grub along on £l5OO a year and his savings. Mr.
Fitzgibbon says that had not a clause been in-
serted in the Retrenchment Act docking the
Chairman £5OO on termination of the current
four years’ office, he (Fitz.) would, of his own
accord, have returned to the Board the same per-
centage of his salary as that by which the highest
of the salaries of its officers was reduced—viz.,
15%. The statement comes a trifle late. The
self-sacrificial intention does not seem to have
been mentioned before Parliament clinched the
matter.
Gilbert Parker is to marry Miss Vantine,
the handsome daughter of a wealthy New York
importer. Soon after Gilbert first burst upon
Sydney as the Rev.
Horatio Gilbert Par-
ker, ho was credited
with attempting a
very lofty matri-
monial flight, which,
however, didn’t come
off.
John Hancock, the burly Trades Hall
leader in Victoria, is 50 this year, and also cele-
brated his silver-wedding in August. He is
physically the biggest man in the Yic. Parlia-
ment, and he had the largest number of votes cast
for him at the last general election. The Argus
has taken to praising him lately for his “ humor
and good nature.” If any of the Trades Hall
people read the Argus this would be enough to
make Hancock distressed.
The egg-bald barrister, Coldhain (Vic.),
when opposing Premier Turner at last general
election in the Freetrade interest, had to stand a
deal of chaff. On one occasion, when question-
time arrived, a hairy individual in the back asked,
“Is the candidate in favor of a tax on bald ’eads?”
“That,” replied Ooldham, “is the first sensible
question asked to-night. There is a tax of 25 per
cent, on human hair, and yet (pointing to his
head) we cannot produce it locally.”
When Major-General Hutton reviewed the
Vic. troops at Langwarren encampment, he issued
a report as to his opinion of the manoeuvres. In
the course of it he devoted a paragraph to praising
one particular officer—Capt Reay, of the Mounted
Rifles. Both Argos and Age printed the whole-
report, with the exception of this particular para-
graph, which they both cut out. Now, Reay is
the editor of the Herald. Such are the little-
nesses of which the “great papers ” are capable

C. EGERBERG BORCHGREVINK, Ant-
arctic Explorer and Lecturer .
Mr. Carsten Egeberg Borchgrevink, the scien-
tist and South Polar explorer, was the first man
to step on to the mainland of Terra Incognita. He
has been in Australia for about eight years, and,
while in Q. Survey Dept, gained considerable,
reputation through scaling Mt. Lindsay, aprecipi
tons peak near the border. Several skilled moun-
taineers had previously failed to perform this feat,
and there are several tales of mysterious disap--
pearances of a more than legendary character.
Four years ago he came to Sydney and joined the,
scientific branch of the Forest Dept. He wa.c
afterwards science master and teacher of modern,,
languages at Cooerwull Academy. As soon, how-
ever, as he ascertained that the Antarctic was in*
Melbourne bound South, he threw up his engage--
ment and took the only position available, that,
of man before the mast. Mr. Borchgrevink is a*
native of Norway, but his mother was an English,-
woman. He was educated at Gjertsen College*.
Christiania, and afterwards studied science in
Saxony. His brother has been, for some 10 years,
representative of Norway and Sweden in Egypt,
where he occupies the position of Procurator-
General of the Foreign Tribunals.
Bishop Murray
(R.C.), of Maitland, re-
ported as dying, was
formerly private secretary
to Card. Cullen at Dub-
lin, and when he was sent
to Maitland was suc-
ceeded in the post by Dr.
(now Cardinal) Moran.
The Cardinal and Bishop
Murray first met at Rome
when one was 12 and the
other 14 years of age. It
was Dr. Murray who got
Dr. Moran “translated”
to Sydney in ’B4.
A fine sportsman
was the old- time (Q.)
Judge Blakeney. They
were holding sports in a,
paddock adjoining the-
court-house of a Westeiin
town while the ancient,
was trying a man
slaughter case. His son,,
who was travelling cir-
cuit with him, was a con-
testant in the high jump;,
which could be seen
through the open win-
dows of the court. The
Judge, who was watch-
ing the sport, forgot all
a' mt the legal business
in hand. “Go it, Mickey,
my son,” he kept saying,
“at him ! at him ! Well
leapt, me boy ! Well
leapt!” Once there was
a dog-fight in the court
during a case. A police-
man interfered. “Lave
’em alone,” yelled the
ould sport. “Let ’em have it out!” and out
they had it.
A Fitzroy, Yic., woman has been sent to
gaol for three months for stealing two pairs of
trousers. It was the poor woman’s misfortune to
be single.
Lord Rosebery bought a historical emerald
necklace for <£20,000 the other day, so possibly the
noble Premier has fallen in love. That would ac-
count for a good deal of his insomnia.

It has arrived ! Long ago The Bulletin
predicted that Parkes would one day lead the
N.B-W. Protectionists.
“ Were it not for the work necessitated
by retrenchment half the Service could be dis-
pensed with.” —Ftc. Pub. servant.
A careful estimate, made by a man who
knows, shows that not more than 25 men of the
present N.S.W. Assembly could sit there without
payment of members.
The Mount Alexander Mail has changed
hands quietly. Judging from recent issues it
would seem that some very good friend of Ex-
Premier Patterson has now a finger in the pie,
Melb. Age has a mild, almost appreciative,
leader on Premier Reid’s proposal to enter
on a course of Freetrade. Under such a system,
the Vic. manufacturers would need no Federation.
London Sunday Times reports joyfully
that the Reid tariff “opens up a new market ” for
England. N.S. Wales was established as a dust-
heap for England. It is still to be a dust-heap
for England.
The license of speech allowed M.P.’s
makes reasonable legislative progress impossible.
Maoriland has adopted a time-scale which seems
to have lived down all objections. Why don’t the
mainland provinces follow suit?
Three hundred Hovas “slaughtered” by
the French—so runs the cable. But the cable
never says that 300 Zulus have been “slaughtered ”
by the English. It is always : “ The enemy, who
fought desperately, 10-t 300 men.”
In the opinion, and no doubt the hope, of ex-
Minister W. J. Lyne, next general election will
completely, and for a generation at least, extin-
guish the Labor-party as an influence in N.S. W,
Parliament. But it won’t come off.
A M.P. last week referred to N.S.W.
Justice-Minister Gould as “ a jelly-fish.” But the
only fish that the bowelless dispenser of nickel-
plated gags really resembles is the hard, dry, salt,
bloodless “Bombay duck” that you eat with curry.
On the “ temporary ” staff of one N.S. W.
department there is an officer plurally important,
because his kith and kin have great political'in-
fluence : he has been three times “retrenched ”
publicly, and three times taken back again in some
underground fashion,
N.S.W. Premier Reid’s “clarion cries”
about Australian Federation are discounted by
*tl,e fact that Victoria already regards his Budget
proposals as strangling Federation, inasmuch as it
absolutely scares off that province from any
attempt at making a similar tariff.
Numbers of Japs, have lately arrived in
the Bundaborg district from the North. Upon
whom the local planters, sniffing cheap labor,
have cast greedy eyes, to be repelled with the cool
remark: “We are not going to work for any
boss : we are going to rent land and work it for
ourselves,”
One M‘Lean, M.L.A., writes to the Dean
defence committee that he is averse to promoting
agitation against “the calm, deliberate decisions
of the courts of justice,” and sends to the papers
an exact copy of his precious screed. Calm and
deliberate justice ! Mount Rennie calm and
deliberate justice !
S.M. Herald, posedly and supposedly a
Freetrade journal, deliberately advocates the un-
flinching continuance of a N.S.W. railway policy
of Protection. Only the Herald doesn’t call it
“ protection,” but merely a system of “defensive
measures.” Verily, the Sydney morning dailies
are the Aholah and Aholibah of N.S.W. Free-
trade !
A Sydney civil-servant has just taken re-
trenchment by the forelock. The postmaster of a
branch office (screw, .£300) recently retired after
long service. His assistant (screw, .£200) offered
to fill the vacancy without increase of salary, and
his offer has been accepted. A noxious example.
There are a thousand people ready to take his
billet by Dutch auction.
Prendergast, the Vic. Labor M.P., petu-
lantly says he will not attend any meeting or speak
in any room where H. H. Champion is present.
Suppose that Champion gets elected for Barba-
ment at next opportunity, as is not at all unlikely,
it will be interesting to see whether Prendergast
insists upon sacrificing the <£3oo a year rather
than sit in the House with Champion.
When George Ash, M.P. (S.A.), Premier
Kingston’s law-partner, was ruined by a libel-
action, he vowed he would see the libel laws
altered. He made law-reform his battle-cry, and
headed the poll. There has been no reform ; but
Ash, now a lawyer, is found in ’95 as prosecuting
counsel pressing against a journalist that very law
which worked his o»m ruin in ’B9 ! This is a
peculiar world.
Both in N.S. Wales and Victoria many of
the so-called telegraph messenger boys are married
men of mature years, with families. Victoria is
shutting down on the old and sedate married boy
as being too expensive and ridiculous for his work,
and N.S. Wales will some day have to do like-
wise. If it doesn’t, some of the boys will by-and-
bye arrive at the statutory ago of 60, and require
to be superannuated.
Victorian: “Premier Turner's dabbling
in business jobs is a downright scandal. The
other day, in CoJlingwood court, Lyons, Turner’s
partner, protested with excellent grounds against
an apparent packing of the Bench ; whereupon
Gaunson, on the other side, made a remark which
might have been expected. He said that Lyons
could, of course, make observations which nobody
else dared to. Quite unwarrantable, but why
should the handle be given ?”
Pendleton’s appointment as S.A. Railway
Commissioner may wreck the Kingston Ministry.
They have wrangled over the appointment for
months, and then selected Traffic-manager Pen-
dleton as a compromise, the Cabinet being divided
as to the merits of Smith and Hill, who, with
Neill, are the retiring Commissioners. The public
regard Smith as the man who should have been
appointed. About .£5OOO a year will be directly
saved by the new appointment.
B. R. Wise fixed a stony eye on “the
natural leader of the N.S.W. Freetrade party ” the
other day. Parkes’words were : “ The great states-
men of England never attempted to reduce the
tariff to tobacco, spirits and opium. It is the
device of shallow persons in all walks of life to
do something which sensible men would never
dream of.” But that is just the tariff—stimulants
and narcotics —which Wise has, in season and out
of season, promulgated and defended. Does “ the
natural leader ” think he is now strong enough to
do without his volatile but faithful henchman?
The Argus fiercely opposed the efforts of
Davitt’s admirers to secure Melb. Town Hall for
the purpose of a demonstration of welcome. It
asks :
Is not the real purpose of Mr. Davitt’s visit, like the
visits of the Redmonds and Mr. Dillon and Sir Thomas
Esmond, to work up feeling in Australia for the political
and party cause of Home Rule on the other side of the
world ?
The Argus is satisfied that this is the purpose of
Davitt’s coming, and concludes that no concessions
whatever should be made. If May and George of
York decide to visit Australia it is to be hoped the
Argus will continue to argue on these lines.
From the time Parkes first handled a port-
folio till to-day he has, while constantly arguing
that the success of the present system of constitu-
tional politics demands the presence of two dis-
tinct parties, separated by divergent conscientious
convictions, held himself on hand for a coalition
with any enemy whose assistance he valu-
able in the pursuit of power. He allied himself
with James Martin in hostility to John Robert-
son, and afterwards led a bitter attack on both.
Later he coalesced with all and sundry to destroy
Robertson, and still later coalesced with Robert-
son against all and sundry. To-day the coalition
with Dibbs aims at the destruction of Reid ; to-
morrow, for the leopard cannot change its spots,
Parkes will stand ready to coalesce with Reid to
destroy Dibbs.

THE WEAKER SEX.
“ Ullo, Bill, [?] up-bin [?]"
“No ; I jest bin [?] a little argeyment with one of them there New
Women,”
Sydney Telegraph, which supports the
Reid (Jovt., publishes telegrams alleged to bo
received from nearly every town in N.S. Wales,
stating that the population is jubilant over the
Reid budget. The Herald, which doesn’t sup-
port Reid nearly so enthusiastically, has seemingly
received hardly any such telegrams, and doesn’t
know anything at all about the said enthusiasm,
that the budget has been received with horror and
disgust. ’Twas ever thus.
THE LADY-FOOTRALL MOVEMENT.—THE AUSTRA-
LIAN CAPTAINESS GETS READY.
A London weekly sniggers at the sweet
ingenuousness of Lord Hopetoun in promising to
accept the billet of Gov.-General of Australia as
“a sacred duty ” as soon as the federated provinces
are ready for him. Poor Hopey’s little head was
much swelled when he fired off his farewell (MS.)
speech in Melbourne. The Cockney journal
reminds him that a good many noble lords would
feel it their sacred duty to put in tenders for the
Australian G.G- job.
No Australian
politician can do juf-
tice to his trust, nor
to himself, if he omit
to post himself in the
details of Queensland,
Maoriland and Vic-
torian constitutional
crises. It can never
be known when an-
other conflict, to be
waged on precisely
the same terms, may
be precipitated upon
any province. If Vic.
toria is sincere upon
the great principle of
one person one vote,
a fray may be near
at hand. Should all
constitutional means
fail, the local Tory
gang will not scruple,
if there is the smallest
loophole, to drive the
democratic party into
thedistressfuldangers
of a deadlock.
The abortive
motion by Stephens,
M.P., in N.S.W.
Assembly, to confer
the franchise on men,
women and children,
was not the unargu-
able proposal the
House considered it.
Belgium actually
gives a married man
two votes at Parlia-
mentary elections, and
the tendency of public
thought there is _in
the direction of giving
a man with children
more influence in the
State than one with-
out. Had the mover,
instead of presenting
himself as an original
thinker, mentioned
the source of his in-
spiration, perhaps he
would not have been laughed out of the House.
Premier Turner’s Retrenchment Commit-
tees have ■ unearthed several public-service in-
formers, who have secret interviews with the
members and tell tales about the convivial,
socialistic, and other proclivities of their office
associates. One of these unsavoury creatures the
other day reported a colleague for having in con-
versation said that he “ didn’t care a damn for
members or Ministers.” The Premier has been
foolish enough to take serious notice of the com-
plaint, and a formal enquiry has been held.
N. S. W. Premier Reid took dancing-lessons
at a fashionable Sydney academy a few years ago.
Ladies who attended the class along with him still
speak kindly of him as a good-hearted person who
only trod on their feet by accident. G. Porgey
never made much progress on the light, dis-
tracted toe; he was a heavy and slow-moving
dancer, and many a snow-white foot was filled
with anguish when the statesman came down on
it in his plain, business-like fashion. Put George
R. always apologised in such a heavenly fashion
that no one could really feel vindictive. When he
left it was generally believed that he knew less of
dancing than when he first came, but most of the
other jpupUs wero aqrry to_lose him all the same*
Maoriland proves the reality of its surplus
by transferring <£150,000 of visible cash to the
Public Works Fund. It is a long time since any
Australian surplus was sufficiently visible to be
transferred anywhere, except by an inky process
in a ledger.
Nothing could more
etrongly display the inepti-
tude of Melb. City Corpora-
tion than the fact that the
weak and pig-headed Snow-
den should have been thrice
elected Mayor. He has not
an idea beyond grovelling at
the feet of a Governor or
pushing forward a sweating
policy for the Corporation
employes. He refused per-
mission to the May Day
procession to march through
the streets, and could not
bottle up his petty feelings
against popular movements
when it was asked that the
Town Hall might be made
available for the reception of
Davitt. “Capture the muni-
cipalities ” ought to be the
cry of the Melb. Radicals
for the next few yea'rs. The
various municipalities are
little hot-beds of Fat-man
tyranny and class greed;
and the City Corporation is
the very worst of the lot,
A visit to Melb. Trades
Hall and Friday evening will
vividly bring home themani-
fest truth of a recent Bul-
letin article : “ Men with
Mouths and Men with Ears.”
All the tin gods of the hall,
Hancock, Prendergast, Bar-
rett, &c., possess fog-horn
voices, and yell in the Council
chamber as if they were ad-
dressing multitudes of 50,000
in the open air. The few men
there who are gifted with a
superior perception and a
logical faculty of expression
are weak-voiced tenors, and,
therefore, only serve as ob-
jects of Hancock’s primitive
humor and Prendergast’ssar-
casms. It would be centuries
before one of these could
command the attention of
any Labor League sufficiently
to gain its selection, while
the average bull-toned new-
chum agitator finds himself in
Parliament within 36months.
A N.S.W. land-tax of Id. in the £ would
extract amounts as follows : From 11,000 holdings,
40s. or under; from 2800 holdings, from £2 to
.£6; 7400 holdings, from <£6 to <£18; 5800 hold-
ings, from <£lB to <£4o; from 1600 holdings, over
.£4O.
Government by Contradiction asserts itself
again in N.S. Wales. The Reid Budget, which
the country is asked to swallow, consists partly
of good beef and’partly of leprosy-scales; of pro-
mises of honest administration on one hand,
and of increasing doses of foreign-trade on the
other. If you won’t .swallow the leprosy-scales
you can’t have the beef, and that’s all about it.
But when you look at the crowd who would be
associated in pulling Reid down what do you see?
The hoary, self-sufficient Parkes, a thousand
times traitor to democracy ; the empty braggart
Dibbs, teetotum tool of craftier heads ; the
See-pbts-Garvan crowd; the envious Ringnose
Wise; and Epps astride of the National Ass. It
is a pleasant dilemma.

constructed of such strength as to

doubled and strengthened by ropes securely

Why, in the name of Honesty, should the
liberation of Dean, the nominally-convicted wife-
poisoner, be dependent on the production of con-
vincing new evidence in his behalf? The public
agitation in his favor was not based on the dis-
covery of new evidence by the defence, but on the
fact that the Crown ease was, on its merits, not
good enough to drown a kitten on ; that the ver-
dict was based on the preposterously ignorant and
ridiculous medical theory propounded by the
Attorney-General and accepted (as per His Honor’s
notes) by the allegedly learned Judge—on the un-
pardonable judicial apology for the self-admittedly
vile career of the chief witness for the prosecution,
and on the judicial disparagement of the prisoner’s
undoubtedly good past character—on the judicial
brow-boating of a divided jury, and the insidious
and indefensible judicial suggestion that a verdict
of guilty could be accompanied by a recommenda-
tion to mercy.
Let the public keep their eyes steadily on the
fact that it is the Crown ease, not Dean’s, which
is on its trial. A hundred thousand voices declare
that Dean’s conviction was a bogus conviction
that the Crown case was not proved, and that so
far as the evidence produced at the trial for the
prosecution is concerned Dean ought to be a free
man. Yet here we have the “lawnorder” con-
tingent, headed by the ever - sneaking S.M,
Herald, organ of judicial absolutism, declaring
that the release of Dean should be contingent,
not on the Crown’s proving his guilt, but on the
prisoner’s proving his innocence !
• • *
J udge Windeyer’s remark, when sentencing
George Dean to death, that he was as sure that he
poisoned his wife as if he (Judge Windeyer) had
seen him do it, is but a repetition of what His
Honor said 11 years ago, when sentencing the
Frenchman Cordini to death, at Deniliquin, for
the murder of the hawker Mison. J udge Windeyer
told Cordini that he was as certain that he mur-
dered Mison as if he had seen him do it;
Cordini was duly hanged. The evidence was
wholly circumstantial, and, strangely enough, the
same reasons as those raised in Dean’s case—the
unfairness of the trial—were put forward as grounds
for a reprieve. A number of people at Deniliquin
still think that Cordini’s innocence—which he pro-
tested even on the scaffold—will yet be established.
# * •
“ I don’t know,” said a briefless wigman,
the other day, during a discussion of the George
Dean case, “ that a better than Rogers could be
secured to head the Commission—unless, indeed,
a layman acquainted with the orderly taking
of evidence could be secured. Salomons wouldn’t
do. Windeyer once insulted him grievously.
Pilcher, though strong, is still dependent on the
courts. It’s this way : If a vacancy be created on
the Bench and the release of Dean means Win-
deyer’s retirement—who is to fill it ? Want won’t.
If, then, Salomons, Stephen, Pilcher, or any other
in the front rank, killed (in a legal sense, of course)
Windeyer, it would be indecent if the killer took
hi t place. And the same indecency would lie if a
District Court Judge acted as chairman and
claimed, as all of them are at present claiming,
promotion from the District to the Supreme Court
Bench. Rogers’s position in N.S.W. legal affairs
is unique; George Dean's case is unique; and
unless the whole thing were to be kept in the
hands of laymen the very best man has been
picked.”
* # *
Shifting Judges is not such an easy thing
to do as some people think. Thirty years ago one
Benjamin Boothby was second Judge of the
Supreme Court in South Australia. He made
things lively there by denying the validity of
sundry Acts of the local Parliament, especially
one or two bearing on Torrens’ Real Property
Act, which, qf course, was very strongly opposed
to the “vested interests” of lawyers. Also, he
was in the habit of creating mild excitement by
refusing to recognise the Attorney-General, and
later after the retirement of Chief Justice
Cooper—by loudly and officially expressing the
opinion that his successor, Richard Hanson, was
not really a Judge. Then he inquired into the
status of Gwynne, the third Judge, with the
eminently satisfactory result (to himself) that the
only legally-appointed Judge in the province was
Benjamin Boothby, who was in the happy con-
dition of holding letters patent from the Crown.
Things got a bit mixed in South Australia, and
people began to think and speak scornfully about
the administration of justice. Parliament sailed
in, and both Houses passed resolutions asking for
his removal, but it wasn’t until this had been done
twice that Benjamin’s mess was cooked. Austra-
lian Ministries aren’t in the same street with
Australian Judges, when it comes to a question
of moving out.
# • #
The way in which the court-martial in the
Ringarooma affair calmly tried the wrong issue
was really very pretty, and very effective, too.
The real question was, whether Surgeon Lea was
justified in acting in a certain way. The question
which the court insisted on trying was, whether
the accused did or did not act in that way. As
the fact that he did so act was never disputed,
the court of captains, by solemnly and cere-
moniously trying this question, at once settled all
doubt as to the result, and avoided all possibility
of hurting the feelings of their prosecuting
brother-captain.
* * *
Dear Bulletin, — Queer how few pro-
testors against the Ringarooma court-martial
decision could keep the “British fair-play”
wheeze out of the discussion of an affair which
proves that there isn’t any such thing. The
average Briton is pathetically blind to the fact
that, while some of the nations look upon him as
merely a pragmatical ass, the majority regard him
as a judicious blend of filibuster and snufilebustcr.
It will take the Englishman 10,000 years to per-
ceive that his complacent impartiality is one of
the standing-jokes of that unimportant portion of
the world outside the British Islands. —Gosmop.

Melbourne Age’s Sydney correspondent,
commenting telegraphically re the Ringarooma
court martial and the popular indignation at the
verdict:—
Three °f the four Sydney daily papers strongly condemn
the finding. One journal, the Herald, finds nothing but
comedy in the incident, involving the ruin of an officer
with the reputation of a long term of meritorious service.

Two courts-martial in less than five months
seem to show that the “Australian” cruiser,
Ringarooma, is a little floating hell. The first
court dismissed the Navigatiug-Lieutenant from
the ship because he broke down after being
almost continuously on duty for 12 days,” and
let off the Captain, who had forced or allowed his
sleepy but sleepless subordinate to navigate the
smp through a maze of coral reefs. The second
has dismissed the ship’s surgeon from the service
for “ behaving with disrespect ” to the Captain—a
sufficiently vague charge in any case. Although
Lieut. Chetwynd was dismissed the Ringarooma,
it is satisfactory to know that the Imperial autho-
rities have since appointed him to a similar posi-
tion on the China station.

One day last week a cold-blooded cable-
gram chronicled the plain, unvarnished fact that
the Earl and Countess of Hopetoun had arrived in
London. No guard of honor, no cannons, no
excited reporters asking them if they couldn’t
think of something they had forgotten to saj' to
the “people of Victoria,” no pot-plants at the
railway-station, no unmistakeable signs of emotion
—nothing. They simply arrived and drove off in
a cab, or barouche, that was waiting for them.
Vulgar draymen cursed their driver for a blanky
hamatoor, who didn’t know where he wasa-gittin’
to, urchins clambered on to the step and thrust
newspapers under the Countess’s mended nose,
cockney clerks stared superciliously at them from
the knife-boards of ’buses, and the noble pair felt
inclined to weep. They did, indeed. There’s no
doubt that lumps came into their throats when
they considered the awful difference between
departing from Melbourne and arriving in London.
Hopetoun is still the Governor of Victoria (on
half-pay)—but the vanity of vice-regal greatness
has revealed itself to him and his good lady under
very painful circumstances. He doesn’t yet know
himself for what he is ; he still hangs on to the
slippery tail-end of the idea that Australia feels
lonely without him, but—our colonial oath ! Hopey
soon found out that he wasn’t what he had been
seven weeks before.
* * «
Melb. Hekald has excited a preliminary
thrill of interest in dear Governor Brassey, that is
to be, by publishing his coat-of-arms, crest, &c.
They make a weird, peculiar picture. There’s the
king of clubs, or some similar potentate, with a
small gander roosting on his crown, and a larger
bird of the same breed supporting him on either
side. A crusader’s shield plays the part of a
heraldic poultice to the king’s oval carcase, like-
wise the big ganders carry shields suspended from
dog-collars. Altogether, the coat of arms, crest,
&c., are convincing evidence that Tom Brassey’s
first parent came over with the Conqueror, and
was one of the leading secrets of Hingland’s great-
ness.

What has become of “ the real Sir Roger ”
Tichborne; also of the Hlellon spooks? It is
“GO ON THE LIND, YOUNG MAN!”
“ A chariot which attracts attention in the town by its originality is that of Andy Barber.
The waggon is made of a dressed slab square box firmly fastened and bolted together, and mounted
on wheels, which are blocks cut off a round log. The team consists of a young bullock in the
shafts (which are made of saplings) and a horse in the lead. The turnout certainly did not cost
much, but it is more useful than some more showy conveyances and the owner carries all his
wheat, flour, chaff, and other products on it. In fact, it answers all the purposes of a waggon,
buggy, and cart ."—From Bligh (N.S.W.) Watchman.
rumored, by the way, that Mrs. Mellon’s long-
promised test-seance will happen shortly, a new
cage having been made for the purpose; but any
seance under the auspices only of the high priests
and priestesses and their dupes will be derisively
regarded by the public. The public, by the way,
is, in the main, level-headed, and is firmly of opinion
that anybody who fancies he can see ghosts or
otherwise hold communication with the next
world, if there is a next world, ought to be locked
up right away from drink and razors.
• • •
The great difficulty in the way of reform-
ing the Judges’ relation system in N.S. Wales
lies undoubtedly in the case of Mr. Langer Owen.
Now, at any rate, Mr. Owen’s extensive practice
is but little dependent upon his relationship to the
chief Judge in E piity. Moreover, his practice con-
sists solely of Equity work and it is to that branch
of the law that he has devoted all his attention.
If, then, he were no longer allowed to practise
before Mr. Justice Owen, it is hard to see what be
could do or to vvhat court he could go. Here un-
doubted hardship would be worked. But in the
other cases the same difficulties do not exist in
anything approaching the same degree. And
something should be done before, through lapse of
time, interests become, in a manner, vested.
Melbourne is howling again about the
woman who won’t remove her hat in
the theatre, and appeals to managers
to insist upon a reform of this nuisance.
Managers in the State of New York
fought against the attempt to outlaw
the woman in the high hat. The
cute theatrical manager knows bet-
terthan to attempt to part a woman
and her hat. A lady in her best tile
always regards herself as part of the

As an utterly squalid rom nice, the story
of Kate Norton, alleged to have been murdered
by Arthur Buck, in Melbourne, is almost unique.
The deid worn in was married at the age of 17,
and lived for a few years along with her husband
in a wooden cottage in a dingy Melb. suburb —one
of those cottages which is elevated on four posts
and has always a goat crawling underneath,
and a lame dog in the back yard, and the
gate tied up with string. Then she took
to drink, and the ill-assorted pair threw the
time-payment furniture and gimoracks at each
other, and finally separated. The husband “got
into trouble ” for illegally using a horse and
cart, and the wife continued drinking, and
lived for a while with a precocious youth with
a cigarette thumb; his name was Buck and his
age about 19. By-and-bye he went up
country ; and then she lived up an alley
with a laborer. The alley was a foul,
dog-infested place of ill-repute, the laborer
was an “unemployed,” and their chief means of
support was what the woman “ earned on
the streets.” She came home one night from
her miserable avocation with her throat cut from
ear to ear. The deed is said to have been done by
her former paramour, with a cheap German razor,
which he bought for 2->., said 2s. being raised by
pawning his vest with one Harris, in a back street

romance : The girl-wife, the wooden cottage ele-
vated on four posts, the husband who “illegally
used a horse and cart, ” the paramour (aged 19)
tfibh the cigarette thumb, the alley, the uuem-
ployed laborer, the woman of the streets, the cheap
German razor, the vest that was pawned for 2s.

Old Dr. Neild, who has a unique experi-
enoe in post-mortem examinations, and an exten-
sive acquaintance with feminine anatomy, is
Kate Norton aforesaid. btie was, says the
veteran doctor, “one of the loveliest women, in
res p ec t to figure, that I have ever set eyes upon.

Her face was a terrible oae the face if a
hardened Bacchante—but she had the limbs of
the Venus di Medici. I have seen many female
figures in my time, alive and dead? but I really

A skull was picked up on Sfc. Kilda (Molb.)
beach, the other day. The eyes remained in their
sockets, and there was a patch of scalp about the
size of half-a-crown adhering to the occiput—no-
thing more; and yet a poor woman turned up
almost immediately and claimed the skull as that
of her missing husband, and found five or six
witnesses who all positively identified the frag-
ment and condoled with the lone widow. Then

the coroner went to work, and demonstrated
beyond doubt that the skull could not possibly
have belonged to the man in question. Not long
back a forsaken wife in another Melb. suburb laid
energetic claim to a derelict body, insisting that
it was the mortal remains of her beloved husband,
and was hardly convinced when “ the real
Mackay ’’ turned up—and was sued for his own
burial-expenses! Rev. Haweis, lecturing on “Is
Marriage a Failure ?” is mistaken in not dwelling
upon the eagerness of wives to identify missing
husbands amongst the miscellaneous human frag-
ments at the morgues.

Mrs. Mountrnorganaire D’Arcy has been
more than usually “indisposed ” of late, and has
been recruiting at Venice. Her eldest daughter
is shortly to be married to Mr. Hankey, while the
second girl, Violet, who is dark and foreign-look-
ing like her handsome mother, is in Paris culti-
vating what promises to be a good voice. Fortune-
hunters begin to regard the D’Arcy “millions”
more critically, realising that there must be many
bites at the cherry—what with one son a budding
diplomat, a second preparing for the army, a
third at Westminster school, and Miss Johnnie
D’Arcy not out of the nursery.

One of the funniest of the Austral Salon’s

and consciousness that the arrangements failed
of their significance sat gloomily on the brows of
the promoters. Not even the knowledge that
they had “bagged Lady Holled Smith” could
alone for the absence of the Hamlet of the
occasion.

In these days of dwindling population and
vacant houses, Melbourne architects see little
light ahead. One of the brotherhood, well-known
as the tenor of a fashionable choir, now manfully
hawks milk in a fashionable suburb. Though
ai led in his new calling by the natural advantages
of pink cheeks, curling hair and a tuneful jodel,
the ex-architect fears that some dark winter morn-
ing he may bash in those clammy milk-cans and
go back to bed, regardless of consequences.
Another architect, who formerly represented
his firm in an important Victorian city, lately
went prospecting, resplendent in a scarlet shirt
belted with revolvers and picnic knives and forks.
At present, he earns ss. per week and tucker by
cooking for his party, and declares he is merely
waiting for the end. However, a camp-rule, for-
bidding any before-meal mention of the “ Gaiety
girls within hearing of the cook,” shows that
“there is life in the old dog yet.”

In a Melbourne club fre-
quented by city men there has of late
been much gambling by day and
night. The other day, as a result, it
is alleged, of a dispute at play, cul-
minating in “You’re a liar,” two
well-known men looked themselves
in a room and, fist to fist, fought it
out. One wore a diamond ring,
which cut his opponent fearfully,
but still it was not quite aone-sided
affair, and the pair had pretty well
battered each other beyond recog-
nition before the door was burst
open. They have since been formally
expelled from the club, which many
peaceable clubites are now leaving.

gant price, too—considering everything.

How they run church bazaars in

owns a very attractive oil-painting,
and the promoters of a recent bazaar
persuaded her to lend it to them
merely for display in one of the stalls.
The owner attended the bazaar and saw
her picture carefully hung, but the day
before closing noticed a label on it
“To be raffled.” She at once rushed
to the committee to ask what was
meant, and was told that it would
be all right. Not satisfied with this
assurance, she also consulted an ecclesi-
astical dignitary, who told her not to
worry a bit —she’d get her picture back
safe enough. So she kept quiet and put
her] trust in the Lord. Meanwhile, the
sale of tickets for the raffle went merrily
on. When the show closed the lady
received her picture back with a polite
note from Rev, Dash to the effect
that he had been fortunate enough to
win it and had much pleasure in re-
turning it. She took it and said
nothing, on the principle that a shut
mouth catches no flies.

A Chinese leper has escaped from
the lazar-house at Sorrento (Vic.), and
up to time of writing had not been
recaptured. All that is definitely
known is that he took the train at
Mornington, and got out somewhere
between there and Melbourne, and
then vanished into the infinite. No
one knows in which carriage the scaly
outcast travelled, or who sat next to
him, or whether he smote his infected
breast when he found himself enjoying
the sweet air of freedom and filled the
atmosphere with germs, or whether he
mashed a girl on the journey, or any-
thing else about him. All that is
known is that he is a Chinaman and
a leper, and that he is shedding germs
somewhere.

city. It was a comparatively wicked and enjoy-
able place when the Fisher family first knew it.
C.B. followed his brother Hurtle’s example and
crossed over to Victoria in 18G6. By that time
Hurtle Fisher had established the Maribyrnong
Park stud, and the offspring of his famous im-
ported stallion, Fisherman, were doing credit to
their birthplace. Ho disposed of the stud farm
and stock at auction when his brother appeared on
the scene with his little lot, and C. 8., who bought
Maribyrnong and most of the plums of the sale,
practically took over the business. From ’66 until
’77 the colors of C. B. Fisher (they are Sam Hor-
dern’s now) were mighty on the turf. His success
as a breeder can be seen in the fact that the Mari-
byrnong blood stock realised .£64,376 under the
hammer when he finally made up his mind to let
the horses go. Once before then Mr. I isher had
sold the stud. Disgusted at the poisoning of his
“crack,” Fishhook, he got rid of the whole bag of
tricks on the art-union principle, thereby provid-
ing a successful precedent for W. R. Wilsons
“ distribution ”of the St. Alban’s property. But
the first sale was merely a passing incident, and
C.B. was soon back again at Maribyrnong. It
was after his second coming that he bred Robinson
Crusoe, the one horse that didn’t find a purchase-
(at £3OOO reserve) when his owner ceased, as sporting
reporters say, to “take an active part in racing”
pursuits. Always a member of the V.R.C. com-
mittee, Mr. Fisher had been annually elected
chairman since 1883. The other week he resigned
his seat on the committee. Bankrupt in fortune,
C. B. Fisher is still rich in honorable reputation,
and all true sportsmen regret that such a straight-
goer should have experienced such bad luck alter
making the final turn for home. A photo, of Mr
Fisher is not procurable. Even his fellow V.R.C.
potentates couldn’t induce him to face a camera
along with the rest of them, though they brought
all their eloquence to bear some years ago. There-
fore a sketch of this good topical subject appears
on The Bulletin’s page of Melbourne illustra-
tions.
Large landed estates in England do not
always prove an unmixed blessing to their inheri-
tors. Considerable coin reserves are required to
maintain an establishment, as well as to keep the
lands in order, and there is generally an increasing
drain on the resources of the proprietor. The
Australian landowner goes to work in a different
way, however, and believes implicitly in the
general principle that money should be earned
before it is spent, and that interest should alway g
be earned on investments. The St. Alban’s estate,
near Geelong (Vic.), is a remarkable case in point.
The property cost .£108,300 ; the administration
since purchase has been liberal (some would say
lavish), and yet the investment has paid 5| per
cent, on its capital. This is the estate (Mr. W. R.
Wilson’s) which is to be distributed on the art-
union principle by “ Tattersall ” (Mr. George
Adams) at an early date. The views published
elsewhere represent a couple of pictures taken in
the garden, and will serve to convey a faint idea
of .the beauties of this famous property.

My Dear Moorabinda—
The Sydney Town Hall ball, to provide funds
for the erection of a new operating-room at the
neatly-kept Lewisham hospital for women and
children, was very successful. You never have
any startling decorative novelties sprang upon
you at a big public ball, but the floor was fast, the
basement supper artistically decorated with
yellow ’mums, and the music lively, with one or
two novel effects. It certainly puts more cling-
someness into the common or garden waltz to
have the orchestra playing a few dreamy bars of
the Intermezzo from “ Cavalleria,” or other real
harmonies, before gliding into the commonplace
three-four beat; if this is going to be tire feature
of the coming ball-season a new joy will be added
to the Byronio dance. Dr. MacOarthy’s musicianly
“ Lyceum ” valse was one of the dance numbers,
also a waltz by Mr. G. Sykes (composer of the
clever “Canala” waltz) which I missed hearing.
Though some amateur compositions are a dis-
tinct addition to dance-music, yet I think the
wholesale system of scoring no matter whose
polka or waltz for full orchestra, and “ringing it
in ” on the public, is an Australian symptom that
needs watching. The success of a waltz depends
so much on the music that it is a heinous offence
for a conductor to substitute the “Wattle and
Dab” or “Damper and Mutton” for Strauss’
“Blue Danube”—unless the former happens to
have made a big local hit.
The weakest point about the Lewisham ball was
most certainly the dressing, taken as a whole. I
was not a bit impressed with the gowning of the
Acting-Governor’s girl-folks, and the invariably
well-grdomed Mrs. Edward Hutton didn’t come.
Exceptions to the general air of dowdiness were :
Mrs. Prendergast, in a rich black frock, with a
simple boutonniere (man’s size) on the corsage ;
Mrs. Maguire (one of the hon. secs.), in buttercup
brocade, with sleeves, and so on, of creamy chiffon
caught with violets; Mrs. W. Brennan, in helio-
trope silk and velvet; a pretty society pianiste,
in creamy silk, with a moire silk sash and plenty
of white chiffon ; and a very stylish unknown,
who sported an exceedingly pretty gown of flesh-
pink corded silk, with a waterfall back of flesh-
pink tulle—big pink sleeves off the shoulder, with
straps of brown fur and some brown-foliaged roses.
Several women wore off-the-shoulder sleeves (a
style that looks as if almost the very worst
we feared would happen when our old shoulder-
straps slipped had at last come to pass), but I don’t
think the uncomfortable pattern which Geraldine
Ollitfe introduced to Sydney when she played the
adventuress in the “Ideal Husband ” will have a
very large following. I may be miles out when
the numbers go up, but still I can’t help think-
ing that a fashion beloved of demi-mondaines (to
judge by the illustrated papers) will not be the
only wear. Even at this early stage it suggests
cigar- boxes. Heaps of men turned up at the
Lewisham ball,: headed by Acting-Governor Bar-
ley (who opened the ball with Mrs. Maguire) and
Admiral Bridge, and great cheerfulness marked
the proceedings in consequence. The committee
will clear nearly -£lOO as the result of their efforts.
I was somewhat amused at the ball-room method
of a society woman at the L.H. ball, who was the
direct opposite of the old-fashioned maiden who
used to be “led forth to dance” according to the
ballads of her day. This Sydneyite did her own
leading, thank you. It was really interesting to
see her dart forward to meet a cavalier and grab
him by his large white-kid-covered hand and tow
him to scratch—it seemed quite New Woman-y,
and the cavalier always looked so frightened that
he was quite en suite.
Man’s innate bashfulness is the worst handicap
the Emancipated Woman has to deal with. She
has not only to break down her own conventional
barriers, but there are man’s ages-old little foibles
and prejudices and notions to be reckoned with
besides; and when she has fought herself free of
her own skin and looks round for applause, lo and
behold ! man creeps further into his shell and
hopes to goodness she isn’t coming in his direction.
If men would only meet women half-way in these
matters, and not leave the liberty-seeking women
to do all the battling, things would no doubt be
made much easier.
But that will never be. Man is a hunting
animal, and only likes that which he catches him-
self. There is no poetry in game bought at the
poulterer’s.
The inter-Australian lawn-tennis tournay at
Sydney Cricket Ground was very entertaining on
Friday afternoon, when Saturday’s crowd was
missing, and even late-comers got a good idea of
what was going forward on the chalked-out
squares. A well-dressed audience looked on, and
received vagrant tennis-balls on its brand-new
parasol with charming equanimity. It looked a
very lady-like mob, too —sober winter gowning
has the same subduing effect on the color-loving
Australienne that mourning has on most people—
the quiet draperies lend an air of refinement quite
English, don’t you know. Here and there were
splashes of color—one lady hoisted a tartan gamp
which seemed an absolute invitation to “ come
under her plaidie.” The ever-juvenile Henry
Bracy, in autumn-leaf brown, accompanied by
Mrs. Bracy in black with rosella pink bows in her
toque, took such an open-mouthed interest in the
matches that one would think that W. and M.
meditate staging a lawn-tennis set.
The formidable array of brown boots visible
would have plunged a blacking-manufacturer into
the depths of despair. Wherever the naval con-
tingent turns out strongly there are always plenty
of tan feet; and the ostler-shaved mariner off duty,
in his loud checks and battered straw hat with his
coat-of-arrns on the band thereof, was well repre-
sented at the tenuis-jousts.
I was not overcome by the stage presence of
the players. I never did admire the lawn-tennis
girl. If she plays according to science you can’t
tell her head from her heels, and if she plays
“pretty’’ she poses too much and sacrifices the
game. The dress isn’t becoming, either—it is too
sjiort for grace, and then you get such to-be-con-
tinued views of the heelless tennis-shoe. Two of
the playeresses were little girls in blue, and the
neat, blue cambric dresses with black ties and
belts looked most becoming until the heat of the
encounter, when the fatal color which would give
a turnip a hectic appearance made the cerulean-
dad damsels look apoplectic. The two in white,
with pale-blue belts and ties, looked the neatest,
ti Ut t>V v ' ew Pedestal revelations I think that
the Bloomer baglet really ought to be adopted for
tennis if the girls came out boldly in pantaloons
we would at least know the worst at once.
The play was rattlingly good in one of the
ladies’ doubles, and I think the best she-racqueter
was a girl in white. I didn’t know anything
about her science or her pretty strokes, but I do
know that she more than once jumped at least 6ft.
in the air to intercept a wicked-looking ball. I
felt rather sorry for some of the players on
Friday. Two frantic youths, with their skins
working freely and gasping for breath, had about
six people looking on ; and two more in the dis-
tance, who also appeared to be leaving no stone
unturned, had an approving audience of one old
lady one players’ fond and faithful grand-
mama, I presume. The great mass of the audience
clings round the stars at the tennis tilt.
The Gov. Duff memorial-fund closed, the other
day, with the modest total of £B4 in the hat—
which, however, will doubtless prove sufficient for
the purpose of erecting a neat memorial tablet
in Fetteresso church. When you come to think
of it a small sum (only very small amounts were
asked for) is best for the memory of a ver3' plain-
living gentleman, and for the artistic reputation of
Australia. It is never safe to trust too much to
the pure taste of any committee, and if the Duff
memorial women had found themselves “rolling
in gold,” the chances are that something in mink-
veined marble, with gilt lettering, and set in gold,
like a set of shop-teeth, might have been the
awful result. There is nothing like forced
economy to ensure good taste in matters of this
kind.
Somebody rose in N.S.W. Assembly, the other
day, and demanded to know how much longer the
Governorship of New South Wales was goin’ to be
hawked about and refused by Imperial hangors-
on ? And Premier Reid, speaking in that subdued
tone of dignified secresy always used by magnates-
in-office when they are forced to allude to
the mysterious workings of the Imperial Authori-
ties—about which they know just as little as any-
one else—“ absolutely denied that the position
was being hawked about.” He had written to the
Agent-General about it, but the fact was that
there was a due sense of the importance of the
position, and the Imperial Government was
making every effort to secure the services of a
gentleman who would be acceptable both to the
’Ome hauthorities and to the people of the
province.
But Australia is getting very tired of this
“ mutually-acceptable ” story. Several recent ex-
amples prove that the LG. takes very little trouble
in making sure that the round peg doesn’t get into
the square hole, and the ways of Providence are
much less mysterious than ‘the gyrations of the
potentates who arrange who’s to govern which of
Australia. A very recent example was a case in
point, and I wonder if South Australia, threatened
with Saint Buxton, is quite ready to subscribe to
the mutually-acceptabie theory ?
The third assemblage of Sydney Home-readers
occurred last Saturday afternoon at Sydney Uni-
versity (absolutely the most unreachable place of
entertainment in Australia for the majority of
people), and was attended by a crowd, principally
feminine, who diligently “did” the programme,
from receptions to refreshments—with stress on
refreshments. They stormed the School of Mines
theatre, where Prof. David gave a deeply scientific
lecture on “The Ice Age of Australia” (fortu-
nately combined with lantern-slides—a naked
savage would grasp a lecture on bi-metallism if
you threw in a few gaudy illustrations to help it
out), so nobody came away exactly in the dark..
After that, there was tea in the cold and dignified
Great Hall, weakly decorated (the hall) with
frivolous potted plants, giving the effect of a
Sphinx with a paper collar on; and before that
there had been a Shakespearian recital by Mr.
Harry Leston, in a wonderful frock-coat.
The dressing was extremely “literary.” I
noticed several buttons hanging by a single thread,,
and one woman’s pocket was half unsewn. Like-
wise, there were several ladies present whose hair
had apparently been chewed by rats. And whatr
do you think of a facially-comely Home Readeress;
in cinnamon-color, a corkscrew fit, with big green
silk sleeves, and a green plush Tara o’ Shanter
very much on one side of a touzled head of yellow
hair? She evidently wanted a course of fashion-
plates for her mental pabulum. One H.R. in
snuff-color had two goose-quills stuck in her hat in
a style reminiscent of the “King of the Mos-
quitos,” and I was amused, too, by a professor in
pale-grey, who had a giddy little Fritellini hop in
his walk that must be most trying to the risibili-
ties of his classes.
I don’t quite know whether I approve of the
Home Readers or not; anyhow, before giving
my final verdict, I would like to penetrate into
a H.R. manage at the trying moment when
the aforesaid H.R, is cooking breakfast. If
she had a frying-pan in one hand and a book (pro-
vided it wasn’t a cookery-book) in the other, I
would be con ; but if she controlled her itch for
literature until her duty was done (as they
say in the “ Gondoliers ”) then I would be most
distinctly pro.
By the way, the Home Readers have a
little grievance against themselves, so I hear.
It is stated that the circles (each suburb has its
circle) are getting too deep. There is a depressing
tendency to disembowel only the most obscure
works for the edification of the leading lights of
the seance, and the meetings, as a consequence,
sometimes consist of two or three spectacled and
bony ladies engaging in an animated discussion on
prehistoric primordial protoplasm, while the rest
of the gang sit about yawning and fidgeting until
time’s up. It is contended by people who have
the interests of the A.H.R.S. truly at heart that
the ambitious effort to get up a bright and shining
circle may wreck the society, which numbers all
sorts of intellects from “brilliant lunatics to
blithering idiots,” as Miss Olliffe says in “An
Ideal Husband,” in its serried ranks. As it is
going now, dull individuals (who, after all, are the
people most in need of this sort of intellectual
goad) drop out of some of the circles from sheer
inability to understand what on earth the learned
members are talking about.
“ La Fille de Madame Angot ” was the Saturday
quick change at Sydney Lyceum for the Comic
Opera people, who must sometimes feel they dunuo
where they are in such a stormy torrent of revi-
vals. lam pleased to record that tenor Tapley,
who made a most intellectual Ange Pitou (in pale-
grey legs, with a trotting-mare’s rosette on his
hat), had to resort to the prompter in the second
act. The letter-perfect Mr. T., who has always
answered to his cue through a long and shifting
season, was becoming almost superhumanly pre-
cise, and his sudden fall from grace seemed to me
a very reassuring circumstance. As Larivaudiere,
Mr. Brownlow had a good millinery part (though
the vocal chances were nil), being most admired
in a certain claw-hammer coat of red and gold
brocade and a pair of miraculously-fitting white
kid tights, which made you wonder how on earth
he got into them. By the way, in the disguised
scene (sloppy calico clothes, a shock of ginger hair
and a stoop), the gods professed to recognise
Frederic Villiers, and loudly hailed him as the
war-correspondent.
The dressing of the ladies was wildly fanciful,
and went to prove that petticoats were not worn
in the days of Madame Angot—only a skirt split
up to the belt on one side, revealing a long
and, as a rule, shapely nether support. Nellie
Stewart, in a short white satin bridal-dress, and
poke bonnet all trimmed with orange blossoms,
had a flesh-pink rounded limb trussed with white
ribbons; and Florence Young, in an Empire
gown of black-figured lace over pink, thickly edged
with pink roses and lined with pink silk, had also
a pale-pink leg (this split skirt idea does give
rather a one-leggy effect), very trickily embroidered
in black butterflies as far as the eye could reach
which was quite a long way, too. In the last act,
Nellie wore a peppermint-striped skirt and a
crimson velveteen bodice, in which she looked
bewitching ; and Florence Young wore a mag-
pie blend. Madame Soldene was immense in
any and every sense as Amaranthe, and acted a
small part like an artist. But what a failure Rose-
year made of Pomponnet, who has the prettiest song
in the piece ! By the way, one noticed in Madame
Angot that Nellie S. doesn’t allow any stage-
lover to fold her to his manly chest just because
he is her accepted Johnny in the stage-directions.
It was very evident on Saturday that “ principals
only ” is her motto when it comes to the hugger-
mugger part of it; the unknown swain is charily
allowed to imprint a warm) embrace on her elbow,
or some such frozen frontier.
From Nicholson and Co. I have received a
parcel of songs that are mainly a joy, with one or
two reservations. “Where Shadows are Not,”
by Frederick Covven, is a soberly-sweet song, well
suited to a mellow mezzo-soprano, and quite free
from sentimental exaggerations. On the merits
of Mascagni’s “Preghiera” it is unnecessary to
dilate, as its reputation is already made ; but it is,
perhaps, news to know that it can now be obtained
in keys to suit all voices, from heavenly soprano
to bull-dog bass —which rather looks as if we were
in danger of an overdose of “Preghiera.”
“Shadowland,” by Stephen Adams (sung by
Patey), is a very dainty song in gavotte time, to be
had in all settings, but is best heard in contralto.
Another song best in the low pitch is “ Do ye hear
thechildren weeping, ’’Mrs. Browning’s tragic words
set to droning, but effective, music by Beprend; but
“ Dapple Grey,” by the same composer, is see-saw
and silly—the kind of lilt people who can’t sing
invariably do sing. “ Home Dreams,” by E. St.
Quentin, is also rather mawkish ; but “ Duncan,”
by Lawrence Kellie (sung by Belle Cole), is a
very promising song for a good emotional con-
tralto to storm the platform with.
From that up-to-date publisher of the latest
local novelties—H. J. Samuells— I have received a
■copy of G. B. Allen’s “ Softly fell the Sunshine,”
which Madame Esty sang so tellingly in Sydney
Town Hall, and I am just as pleased with it on
nearer view. It is a mezzo-soprano song, and
words and music are very quaint and pathetic.
Lady Holled-Smith, Melbourne’s new social
light, is evidently a most considerate hostess. I
hear that at her late At Home women with com-
plexions like the inside of a shoe or the back of a
doormat noted with satisfaction that the light was
shaded and shuttered out of the reception-rooms,
and only a faint twilight gloom pervaded the
scene.
The Misses Fitz-Stubbs, of Sydney, assisted bv
Miss Violet Aaron, of Melb., have opened a dress-
making and designing establishment in Regent-
street, London.
Yours affectionately,
SAPPHO SMITH.
SPORTING NOTIONS.
A totalisator argument. At S.A.J.O. Autumn
Meeting, May 4, Bombastic was beaten by a head for first
place in the Hurdles. £1786 was the total sum in the
machine, and three persons only backed Bombastic. Had
he won there would have been a div. of £550. In the old
days, what a scoop for the bookies 1 In this instance the
tote laid 550 to 1, the books laid 15 to 1. The totaiisator
must come.
• * • *
Australian racing clubs using totalisators are
increasing stakes and profits, the public at the same time
obtaining fair odds. The bookmaker thrives where stakes
and profits are being extinguished in his interest, and the
public receive prices in no way a reflex of the odds against
them.
• • • *
S.A. bookmakers are continually in trouble.
S.A.J.O. recently made a by-law against tote-commission
agents, aimed, of course, at the Hebrews, but so sweeping
that it is now illegal for one man to put a sov. in the tote
for another, such being declared unlawful by the club.
The layers have formed a strong union and intend to fight
the clubs in the court.
• • * »
The first day’s results at the S.A.J.C. meeting
were indeed calculated to produce a horrible massacre of
bookmakers in every region where Ikey influence keeps
the Tote at bay. The Adelaide machine naid divs. as fol-
lows over six events: £56, £U 75., £35 145,, £9 155.,
£6 ss. (only four starters), and £ll 7s. Thirteen started
for the race in which First Bolt paid a £56 divvy, and two
of them were much ranker outsiders than the winner. It
must be a very infatuated punter who can look at those
figures and refuse to admit that punting with bookmakers
(in Australia) is ruinous folly. “Any price outsiders ! ”
shouts Ikey when 13 numbers are up. “ What price First
Bolt? ” say you. “Height to one!—not good enough?
Well, ten to one to you, hy G—d ! ” shrieks the reckless
Hebrew. For the next month you plume yourself on
having pulled off a good bet, although you merely got
one-fifth of its proper value. The difference between a
bookmaker’s “outsider” and an outsider as it appears in
the Tote’s returns is always ridiculous.

Melb. has more racecourses (shearing-sheds)
than any town five times its size. It has one for every
day in the week (Sundays included) and three over. In a
word, there are 10 racecourses within a few miles of Melb.

Had Sheet Anchor lived, it would have been a
fight between him and Trenton for pride of place at one
stud. In his short career, the Anchor left his mark in
The Harvester, Caspian, Duhallow, Our Jack, and a dozer
other first-class gallopers.
* » ♦ *
Nearly every Sheet Anchor horse raced in Melb.
at present is coming to the front. The “defunct’s”
latest successes were two wins in one day at Aspendale
Park (Vic.). Tiny took the half-mile handicap, and Gun-
boat the welter. Tiny is from Streamlet, a good mare, and
Gunboat is full brother to Best Bower. Sheet Anchor
looks like taking a position not many removes from
champion sire, shortly.
* * * *
Elswick’s win at S.A.J.O. meeting on the
second day broke his long accumulated turf ice. On this
occasion, the Burrumbeet people backed the son of Nor-
denfeldt up to the hilt, and he won—on the post by a
head.
• » * *
Tiie bad luck of Mrs. Carr’s filly, Monastery, in
just losing Tattersall’s Cup, the S.A.J.C. St. Leger, and
Adelaide Cup, by a bare head, reminds one of Devon’s
last year Spring performances in Victoria, when he ran
second in the Caulfield, Melbourne, and WilKamstown
Cups.

J. Anwin, who rode the Adelaide Cup winner,
Elswick, won the ’9l Melb. Cup on Malvolio. He was
almost unknown at the time, but having ridden the son
of Malua in his work was allowed the mount in the race
and won.

The V.R.C. has decided to try the experiment of
addingfouroccasional Saturday meetings to its annual pro-
gramme-one each in August, September, April, and June.
The September meeting will inaugurate the season which,
in the booming days, was known as the Racing Carnival,
and it ought to catch the ghost of popular excitement on
the hop. Saturdays in August and April should pay
expenses, but the June fixture looks less promising. Any-
way, it has been good enough for the rival V.A.T.C. to
hold meetings in every month of the year, so the senior
club, with its greater means of entertainment, can hardly
do wrong by arranging four new bills.

See how the Devil whispers in a man’s ear !
“ Willie ” Cooper, of Sydney, lately sold his colt Kirk-
connel, and lo and behold 1 it straightway goes and wins
the Two Thousand Guineas and becomes first favorite for

and fish for another Kirkconnel, and won’t find one in 20
years.

It would be as well if each proprietary course
had its own handioapper. It has often happened thai a
handicapper has taken an unreasonable view, to put it
mildly, of the abilities of some particular owner’s horses;
hut, with a system of separate handicappers, an owner
under the ban of one handioapper would have a show of
getting fair play at the other courses.
* * * *
Rosebery Park might well give trotting a trial,
ruling owners from the start with a rod of iron. In the
past, the proprietors of the courses have been as much to
blame as the owners for the “ stiff ” running. Had Can-
terbury and Kensington in the “past” “senl-up” the
crooked ones without fear or favor, the trotting-horse
would now be in a fair way to take the place in our
weekly sport which he so well deserves.

Scarpia, formerly the property of S. G. Cook
(Vic.), is now located in W.A. That he is considered the
local champion sprinter is shown by the fact that he is
never allowed into any handicap under lOst. He won at
York recently with 10st. 31bs. in the saddle, and in the
approaching W.A.T.O. races he is called upon to carry the
steadier of lOst. 91b.

Dear Bulletin, —A correspondent asked the
height of the biggest Australian thoroughbred. I think
Mr. S. Miller’s Mernder can undoubtedly claim the honor.
This giant stood 17.2, and was the cleverest fencer of his
time. His great races with Mr. Pearson’s madbrained
mare, Lady Ashton, will be remembered by racegoers.—Z.

Dear Bulletin,—A live “ dead-bird ” : A swal-
low’ flew into the office (at Adelaide), and the door having
been closed the bird was asked for a straight tip on the
list for the Goodwood Cup. When Mostyn was called the
swallow immediately settled on the clock ; the list being
re-read, when the name of Mostyn was mentioned, down
went the bird on the clock again. At a casual mention
of Mostyn the swallow once more settled on the clock.
On Mostyn being mentioned for the fourth time the
swallow at once re-perched on the clock. This gained
him his release, and three clerks straightway subscribed
3s. 4d. each to back the dead-bird of a live one—and same
evening divided £l7 16s. result of tote investment. True

Carbine has been insured in England against all

There is quite a mania just now in England,
writes Tub Bulletin’s London correspondent, for insur-
ances of all kinds in connection with racing. The under-
writers at Lloyds will take any risk so long as it is well
paid for. They must have dropped a good bit over the
insurance of racing - fixtures postponements, so many
meetings have been abandoned. The moving spirit in
this new form of gambling is Mr. Henry Nixon, deputy
chairman of Lloyds, who is a rather hoi sey man. He was
in Australia buying remounts for India with old Col.
Bobbins, and rode two or three races at Homebush on
Whisker, a well-known horse in those days. Nixon
married a daughter of the late Canon Allwood. One of
those who underwrite these risks is Mr. Hawke, who is
the moving spirit in connection with the anti-gambling
league. This is inconsistency if you like, but principles
go to the wall.when the question of £ s. d. comes in.
HARDPHIZ, the centre forward, getting into
form for the approaching season.
The interprovincial lawn-tennis tournament
closed last Saturday. The day was flue, and Gregory s
courts were excellent, but at 11 o clock, when the first
contest began, enough of the night’s dew remained to
make the ball grow heavy. Green had gone home to
Victoria, so Crossman, of Armidale, challenged VVebb. the
holder, for the single championship of N.S.VV. Webb, the
domdity player in this five-set contest, had been out of
form the whole week past, and Crossman very often
scored by playing steadily and waiting for Webb s mis-
take. Still Crossman has condition, agility and skill, and
Webb, even at his best, would find him a most difficult
opporent. As it was, Grossman outclassed Webb by
winning straight off the first three sets and the coveted
championship.
Tile match which delighted the hearts of the
zealots was the ladies' single championship between Miss
Shaw of Victoria, and Miss Dransfleld, of NS. W. Miss
Shaiv is a brown-eyed, symmetrical girl with a plump,
muscular figure. She understands that tan shoes
make a woman look a near relative of Crusoe s
savage, so she wears black ones. Miss Dransfleld is of
slivhte'r build, and wore a broad leather band around her
These girls gave, perhaps, the finest exhibition of
ladies’ tennis ever seen in Australia, and the way they
contested splendid rallies, and the resolution with which
they flew in and out and around the court and took im-
possible balls, caused the male onlooker to pray that both
had had three months’ training. Otherwise they will nob
be able to get up for a week.
Miss Shaw, being the stronger, served with more
force and returned harder. She also excels Miss Drans-
fieid in placing the ball, and this skill of hers won her
many a game. There is one tiling Miss Dransfleld has-
an excellent nerve, which enabled her to win the second
set after losing the first. The girls played at their best in
the rubber, but Miss Dransfleld was tiring, and when Miss
Sha!w had won five games to one the spectators thought
all was over. Then Miss Dransfleld’s nerve helped her to
win two games ; but the severe rallies exhausted her and
Miss Shaw won the next game and the match. After a
few minutes both ladies came out again and Miss Shaw
partnered Golquhoun and Miss Dransfleld paitnered
Webb for the Ladies’ and Gentlemen s Challenge Pairs.
Golquhoun played with such brilliancy that he seemed
to take the spoils of victory under his arm from the very
first, and he and Miss Shaw won ajery one-sided contest.
George Giffen, in a Pall Mall Gazette article,
considers that the best Australian Eleven would be
slightly stronger than Stoddarfs Eleven. Possibly A
Stoddartian travelling eleven have to be taken as they
come into the field, some of them a trifle “ off’ in health,
others suffering from liquor, perhaps ; whereas Giff. a idea
of a “ representative ” Australian Eleven is a thoroughly
sound and sober body of men selected at the last minute
on their latest “ form.” Judging from what one knows
about the Englishmen’s vagaries in Australia, one would
an'v that they at their best all round, were slightly
superior to the best eleven procurable by Giffen. But
they didn’t “blow” on the subject. Stoddart and 00.,
from first to last, flattered their opponents in preference
to flattering themselves.

A Masterton (M.L.) senior football club has
unanimously adopted the following sensible rule:
“Should any member be disabled through injuries
received on the field, a levy of 6d per week shall be
struck on all the club members, which shall be handed to
the injured member upon production of medical certifi-
cate,” &o. . , *
The name of Beach is not likely to soon fade
from the annals of Australian sport. Arnold Beach, son
of “ the people’s William,” is entered for a coming con-
test at Clyde River regatta. The youngster is spoken of
as a shapely, likely customer. #
Americans begin to discover a peculiarity about
Australian fioxersf noted by Tim Bulletin a few years
ago. Though Foley was for his weight a punishing hitter,
his best pupils, such as Griflo, Jem Hall and Steve Q Don-
nell, are remarkable for the quickness rather than the
force of their blows. Even the matchless Peter Jackson
owes his position, not to hard slogging, but to the grand
science which enableshim to stall off opponents until they
get worn-out in their vain efforts to hurt him. The
reason is that these men throw their weight forward.
Their blows have a less distance to travel, but they cannot
get up steam as a man does whose centre of gravity is
farther back. However, their quickness enables them to
forestall and slop a hard hitter. Hence Foley’s rule
“ Let the beggar beat himself.”

After Essendon’s first match for the Vic. foot-
ball premiership, in which the new goal-kickers turned
out awful failures, the committee telegraphed to Thur-
good, their champion goal-kicker of last year, who is pro-
specting in W. A., to come over at once. Of course Thur-
good is not a profes-nonal. He is not paid wages—he
only gets “expenses.”

At Hawke’s Bay races (M.L.) one of the leading
side-shows was a budding Maori girl in knickerbockers.
'Twas a magnificent fit, and she walked like a soldier.
After the meeting she mounted a bike, and pedalled to
town ; none of your namby-pamby pedalling, but good
lean-over man’s style. In the evening she appeared at
the theatre, and created quite an impression, as her
costume was unchanged.

The two Sids., Gregory and Walford, were the

Horses are a drug in the market in the North.
A smart auctioneer had to sell a cart-horse, and received
a bid of 15s. “ Fifteen shillings !” he bawled. “Who
says ‘ a sov. ?’” “ Does the harness go with the horse ? ”
queried the bidder. “No—only the halter!” “Then—

Heffernan, the Maorilander, and Kelly, of
Natal, fought last month in the Amphitheatre, Johannes-
burg. £9OO were taken at the doors and the excitement
was intense, but the affair proved very tame and easy for
Heffernan. Kelly went out in the fifth round. Sullivan
has challenged the victor, and they will meet in May.

The whole Australian political question is—
how to deal with the Legislative Councils. lat-
man is lying dead-drunk across the pathway of
political progress.
Lieut.-Gov. Barley (N.S.W.) will hold
this year’s Queen’s Birthday levee, not on the
24th inst., but on the 27th, which is also the 80th
anniversary of ex-Premier Parkes s birthday.
A seaman named Gillespie has got a year s
gaol from the Sydney naval court-martial for
striking his superior, petty-officer Buckley. At
last is solved a great problem : it is now quite
clear who struck Buckley.
The submarine mine-failure at the recent
military operations at Sydney Heads was, it is
explained by General Hutton, in a letter to Mr.
C. E. Stokes, due to the use of Obsolete apparatus,
and in no way reflected on the efficiency of
robnrite as an explosive. The sale of roburite,
despite the naturally conservative bent of miners
in such matters, is rapidly increasing in Austra-
lasia.
| The Bulletin hears that an old woman,
nearly-related to one of the four banged Mount
Bennie beys, has written to ex-Governpr Caring-
ton cordially congratulating him on the birth of a
son-and-heir. The congratulations in question
were of the order which might reasonably be ex-
pected from an old Irish party whose kinsman had
been convicted and slaughtered (after an all-day-
and-all-night sitting) by a sleeping jury, on the
evidence of an utterer of forged cheques and an
arsonist.
“ Crom-a-boo,” the irresistibly funny and
rollicking Irish song of the Hoben Brothers, which
Sappho Smith opined would prove “a terrible
success,” is already proving. Lonnen has taken
it up in London, and Lauri is to sing it in
Australia; it is to be well introduced in America,
and in Maoriland. where that clever comedian,
Percy, of the Pollard Lilliputians, is making a
feature of it. It is also a universal success and
heard everywhere. Paling’s have already cleared
the first big edition, and have got out two others
in E flat and E. It is certainly the funniest Insn
football-song ever written, and the press every-
where has risen to describe it as the best comic
song of the day, and funnier than “Killaloe ’ or
“ Ballyhooley.” It,is just the thing lor an aspir-
ing oomique, pro. or amateur."
A remarkable fact. Mr. W. Joshua
Wilson, aged 58, was terribly injured in the Red-
fern railway-accident of 21st Oct. last. Mr.
Wilson’s ease, in fact, was regarded as one of the
most serious of all, he having completely lost one
eve and been otherwise permanently injured in the
smash. At one time while he was in the hospital
his life was despaired of. Yet, instead of prose-
cuting his undoubted claim to heavy damages, he
presented himself the other day at the office of the
NSW Railway Commissioners, and presented
I to’ the ’department a voluntary release from all
claims on account of the injuries he had sustained.
The Bulletin never before heard of such a thing.

On 10th July, 1788, Lieut.-Gov. Major
Ross wrote to Mr. Under-Secretary Nepean :
“I will in confidence venture to assure you that
this country will never answer to settle in, for
though I think corn will grow here, it cannot be
in less time than 100 years hence. I therefore
think it will be cheaper to feed convicts on turtles
and venison at the London Tower than be at the
expense of sending men here.”

“ Higinbotham’s oratory was Eclipse first,
and the rest nowhere. Malice was its essence, a
Robespierrian hate at a white heat. He had a
lovely, innocent, boyish, almost childish look,
and would get up in the Legislative Assembly,
amid the thronged green leather benches, stam-
mering out in a low tone, after the most hypo-
critical oratorio fashion, well knowing that, in a
few minutes, he would have Langton and all that
crew—in a Higinbothamic sense—lashed to frenzy,
the House surging about like the sea-waves, while
as the reporters affectionately named him,
was churning out slow, deliberate, staccato sen-
tences about England as a foreign power, and the
man Rogers at the Colonial Office, who was the
real Czar of all the British colonies.”— Herbert

Louis Ellis, who is retired as Yic. sheriff
after 43 years’ service, is a Sydney native. His
brother is Angel Ellis, who has been time out of
mind accountant to the Metropolitan Gas Co.
Mr. Louis Ellis left Sydney in the forties as a
mere boy before the gold-digging days, to seek his
fortune in Melbourne. When under 20 years of
ago he had worked himself up into partnership in
a clothing store at the Bourke and Elizabeth-st,
corner, facing the Post-office. From that he
graduated to Harris’s big clothing store, now occu-
pied by the London Tavern in Elizabeth-street.
If Louis Ellis, the retired sheriff, should now
write his “ reminiscences,” as ’bis the fashion to
do. he will have much to tell of the curious and
notorious criminals who have, so to speak, passed
through his hands. As also of the different hang
men who, had they failed to do their office, would
have caused Ellis to take that last duty of a
sheriff upon himself.

THE HISTORY OF A SOAR.
jj l6 ka°k my right hand —just about the
middle of it there is a small scar, half as big as
a threepenny piece perhaps. You would never
notice it unless I showed it to you, and even then
you would have to look sharp to see it. But it’s
there, all the same, and will be until the hand is
returned to dust. It dates back forty years, that
scar does. Going home from school one day
another boy and I quarrelled and fought. Strange
to say, it wasn t about a girl either. Anyway he
drew his jack-knife and stabbed me in the back of
the right hand. The wound, I remember, was
8 jTu’ 0 was sore an< i inflamed for months,
and hardly a day passed but something hit it, or I
knocked it against something, and so made it
worse. My whole available body appeared to be
concentrated in that sore. You know how such
tilings are. They are like boils, and if there is any
comfortable spot to have a boil there are loads of
money waiting for the fellow who discovers it.
Lately we have received two letters, both con-
taining an identical expression, namely, this •
Everything seemed a trouble to me.” Now, none
of us are so tough as to be proof against trouble
but when everything is a trouble to a man the very
heart inside of him must be tender and touchy
And, mercy knows, it is so often enough. Grief
will do it, worry will do it, and illness too.
One of these letters, or, at least, the writer of it
goes on to say:—“lt was in March, 1880, that I
felt tired and languid, and without my usual
energy. Before that I had always been strong
and active. Now I was low-spirited and melan-
choly ; everything seemed a trouble to me. At
first I had a bad taste in the mouth, a poor
appetite, and all I ate gave me great pain in the
chest and sides. Even fish and poultry gave me
as much distress as more solid food. I was
constantly spitting up a sour, acid fluid which
caused a miserable feeling in ray throat and
mouth.
“After I had been for some time in this con-
dition I was attacked with gout in my hands and
feet, which confined me to the house now and
again for a week or two at a time. The parts
became inflamed and swollen, and gave me excru-
ciating agony. I could not bear anything to touch
them. For four years I was subject to these
attacks. The doctor who attended me was able
to ease me temporarily, but I was soon as bad as
ever.
I n _ the middle of April, 1888, I read that cases
like mine had been cured by Mother Seigel’s Cura-
tive Syrup, and I thought I would try it. I hadn’t
taken more than half a bottle when I felt relieved
This encouraged me to keep on with the
and in a comparatively short time all symptoms of
the disease left me. Since then I have enjoyed
excellent health, and whenever I feel a twinge of
my old enemy a dose or two of Mother Seigel
soon sets me right.—Yours truly, (Signed) M.
Leahy, 49 Grosvenor Terrace, Grosvenor Park
Camberwell, London, September 22nd, 1892.’’ '
So much for the facts as Mr. Leahy felt them.
What has science to offer in explanation of them ?
This. Gout, rheumatism, and biliousness are three
complaints arising indirectly from an overworked
liver, or, more properly, from indigestion and
dyspepsia. The poisons so engendered may lie
hidden and unfelt for a long time, and then be
suddenly rendered active by mental worry,
exposure, over eating, wrong eating, or any of a
dozen other causes. The kidneys fail (following
the stomach and liver), the acid poison remains in
tiie blood and sets up inflammation in the joints,
and the retained fluids produce dropsy. All sorts
of disturbances are apt to go with this condition
of things, every one less a disease in itself than a
symptom of the one cause indigestion and
dyspepsia. The heart and lungs areoften attacked
in sympathy. Cure the torpid digestion, and an
all round improvement at once succeeds. To do
this is in the power of Mother Seigel’s Curative
Syrup—as, perhaps, in the power of nothing else.
It was most unfortunate that this gentleman
suffered for eight years; and no wonder, mean-
while, that his mind was sensitive as his body to
every approach. Knowing what he now knows he
feels safe. There is no darkness but ignorance, and
the German Nurse shows “The way out.”

IMPORTANT!-
Herr RASSMUSSEN'S Business being
purely a Proprietary Remedy Business,
nothing whatever is charged to anyone hut the advertised price for
the Remedies, which is also printed upon each box.
Herr RASSMUSSEN wishes it clearly understood that
all of his Establishments throughout the Colonies are purely
Depots for tin- SALE of his Proprietary Remedies, viz.,
THE ALE A LINE REMEDIES, and, therefore, merely
Patent Medicine Depots ; and not surgeries or places for
Treatment of Diseases, neither are they Chemists’ or Pharma-
cists’ establishments ; but the Laboratory at the Head Office
is under the supervision of a qualified and registered chemist,
holding the British diploma, and registered by the N.S.W.
Pharmacy Board.
Herr RASSMUSSEN desires also to make it clear to
his numerous patrons, that he depends absolutely upon the
merits of his Herbal Proprietary Alfaline Remedies, and that
neither he nor any of his representatives are Doctors or
Pharmacists—that he is merely the Manufacturer and Pro-

skilled botanist, but that his chief laboratory is supervised
by a registered pharmacist.

General Debility of the Nervous’System for over seven years, and

Sydney and Melbourne, I was advised to try your Alfaline Remedies.

A Wonderful Cure.
Herr Rassmussen. August, 1894.
Dear Sir,—ln the year of 1871 I was eight days m the water slice; -
washing, and contracted rheumatism and stiffness in the joints, and
have tried all advertised medic urns. When I came to Sydney I had a
great difficulty in walking, and went to the Turkish baths, which d d
no good. Passing your window I saw a testimonial from Mr. B. W.
O’Sullivan, M.P., with the same complaint as I had, which led me to
try your Remedies. On Thursday before Good Friday I took the first
of your Pills; since then I have used 4 boxes Special Powerful Alfaline
Vitality Pills, 3 boxes Special Powerful Alfaline Rheumatic Pills, witli
Liver and Kidney Pills, and free use of your Alfaline Eucalyptus Oi',
and I am now, witli the blessing of God, as well in health as I was 23
years ago. I can with great confidence recommend your Remedies to
anyone suffering from the same complaint. May you long be spared
under God to be a blessing to suffering humanity.
I remain, dear sir, yours very gratefully, JOHN KEAY.

To Herr Rassmussen.
Dear Sir,—l have much pleasure to inform you that your Alfaline
Remedies have acted most wonderful in my case, and I consider that
the great virtues vou claim for them have been entirely substantiated—

vou are second to none as a human benefactor.

A self-denial week for Melb. Hospital
commences on 20th inst. The Agr and Argus
have come out with strong leaders on the matter,
but without any tangible proposal. Thb Bulle-
tin therefore proposes that every Victorian should
for that week deny himself his morning paper and
send the pennies to the fund.
The Oollingwood (Melbourne) tragedy—
the axe-splintering of a suspected wife and mother-
in-law—is a meteoric attestation of the distinctive
sex-fashions in murder; and is appropriate just
now when the “Dean poisoning case ’’ is seething
unquietly in the public mind. Poisoning is the
chosen method of murder by the average female.
Bloody violence, with firearms, knives, axes, or
bludgeons—something with brains and gouts of
gore in it—is the sort of slaughter that the
mind of the male assassin broods over ; with suicide
thrown in for dessert, as in the Oollingwood case.
Hearne’s Medicines, as advertised in
another part of this paper, form an imposing body
of salves and lotions and pills and draughts. Mr.
Hearne goes on the principle that you shouldn’t
fire a charge of duokshob at the Tantanoola tiger,
or sight your artillery for Botany when the Rus-
sians are at Bondi; but should, as it were, fit the
punishment to the crime, and the remedy to the
ailment. So he has fixed up 61 different kinds of
cures for as many kinds of diseases, and a man
who has No. 38 disease is fixed off at once with
No, 38 cure, while a man who has a complication
of No. 38 and No. 11 can mix his medicines accord-
ing to directions and get there just the same.

Addenda to Reports,
When the notorious fallibility of the average
mining expert was borne in mind, it became a
matter ot some difficulty to secure a perfectly
independent report. In view, however, of obtain-
ing large monetary assistance from England, the
Irustees took the precautionary course of solicit-
ing the aid of the Chamber of Commerce, Q.,
who, in the interests of the district, might under-
take an inspection of the property. This was
done, and the following documentary evidence
(abbreviated) speaks for itself. It is estimated
that 12 grains to the load will pay.
Declaration Duly Sworn.
We, Joseph Hickson, George Hickson, and
Ldwm Hillary Rolls, of Gladstone, in the Colony
of Queensland, do solemnly and sincerely declare
that we visited the property known as Hew Zea-
land Gully Freehold on the ninth and tenth days
of March, 1895, and that we dispensed with the
services of the mining manager in charge of the
property. [Here occur details of the inspection. )
We have no interest whatever in the above
property, directly or indirectly, and we are of
opinion that the entire Gully systematically sluiced
on a face will average at least six pennyweights of
gold to the load of (say) 120 dishes averaging 22 to
241 b. to each dish. This declaration is made oi
our own free will, and is our joint and several
unbiassed opinion and belief.
Signed
f JOSEPH HICKSON.

Note.— The inspection was made under the
supervision of the Hon. Sec. Chamber of Com-
merce, Q.
_ , „ Gladstone, April 22nd, 1895.
To the Trustees,—
I have much pleasure in forwarding you here-
with a Declaration of Messrs. Joseph Hickson,
George Hickson and Edwin Hillary Rolls, all of
Gladstone, in the colony of Queesland.
2. These gentlemen are well-known to me as
very straightforward, reliable, honest men, who
are now living a retired country life, having done
well in the mining ventures of ‘this district. They
are experienced miners of many years standing.
. 3. Ihe Report sworn to by these gentlemen is,
in my opinion and to the best of my belief, a most
reliable one. The Boyne-Calliope Freehold is
well favored here as a valuable mining property,
and if worked by hydraulic sluicing should far
exceed the estimate of six dwts. to the load, as
stated in their report.
4. I would add that the locality referred to is
, renowned for a phenomenal output of alluvial gold
i in the early period of its discovery, and it is my
firm belief that the scheme of hydraulic sluicing
you propose adopting should reveal other import-
ant auriferous deposits.

Boyne-Calliope Freehold, which includes New
Zealand Gully and two miles of dredging area on
the Boyne River. The locale of this property
' includes the richest deposit of gold that has yet
been discovered in the district of Port Curtis. . .
Hampered owing to the Government in its early
innocence permitting the property to become free-
hold. (Thus excluding the miners),
i So far as I glean, the scheme of hydraulic
sluicing is exactly what is wanted, and should
result in a rich profit to the shareholders. lam a
resident of the district for over forty years, and
have always taken a deep interest in mining.
Wishing you every success in your undertaking,
which I feel certain will exceed the most sanguine
anticipations,
Faithfully yours, JASON BOLES, M.L.A.
Bank Certificate of the Gold Already Taken
from Netv Zealand Gully.
The Australian Joint Stock Bank,
The Trustees, 19th March, 1895.
Boyne-Calliope Freehold Syndicate.
Gentlemen,
I have much pleasure in certifying—so far as
banking and other authentic records will permit—
to the yield of gold, obtained during the first rush,
from New Zealand Gully, the locale of which is
nearly the centre of the present Boyne-Calliope Free-
hold. The Australian Joint Stock Bank has let n
established at Gladstone (originally known as Porn
Curtis) for thirty-one years, and possesses inter-
esting information and valuable records of the
local goldfields.
From the records to hand, and the estimates of
those now in the district who shared in the rich
harvest, the gold obtained during that period with
cradle and pan was upwards of 280,0000zs
valued at about ,£3 17s. 6d. per 0z-
£1,085,600. I was assisted in this estimate by
three respected residents who took part in the
rush, and describe the gold as “ literally taken out
in tons.”
Experienced miners are positive that the go’d
has come from rich reefs in the neighborhood of
New Zealand Gully, and their opinion is shared
by the Government Geologists.
The scheme of Hydraulic Sluicing you propose
adopting will doubtless be the means of bringing
these sought-for reefs and other important auri-
ferous deposits to light.

prospectus may be obtained from the Brokers to

SKIN DISEASE
CUBED BY
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla
Mr. Geo. W. Burtner, Keezletown, Va.,
writes, as follows:
“ Shortly after leaving college, I was troubled
with a skin disease which showed itself, first, at
the ankles. Physicians pronounced it eczema,
and treated me for that complaint. The erup-
tion crept slowly up my limbs, and on the body,
until it enveloped the whole frame. It gave me
infinite trouble with constant itching, casting off
of dry scales, and a watery liquid which would
exude from under the scales. I treated it for
over three years unsuccessfully, and was unable
to check it, until I began using Ayer’s Sarsapa-
rilla. I used three bottles of this medicine and
was completely cured —my skin becoming as
smooth and clear as before.”

A SONG FOR THE NIGHT.
O the Night, the Night, the solemn Night,
When Earth is bound with her silent zone,
And the spangled sky seems a temple wide,
Where the star-tribes kneel at the Godhead’s
throne ;
O the Night, the Night, the wizard Night,
When the garish reign of day is o’er,
And the myriad barks of the dream-elves come
In a brightsome fleet from Slumber’s shore I
O the Night for me,
When blithe and free,
Go the zephyr-hounds Ob their airy chase;
When the moon is high
In the dewy sky,
And the air is sweet as a bride’s embrace!
O the Night, the Night, the charming Night !
From the fountain-side in the myrtle shade,
All softly creep on the slumbrous air
The waking notes of the serenade ;
While bright eyes shine ’mid the lattice-vines,
And white arms droop o’er the sculptured sills,
And accents fall to the knights below,
Like the babblings soft of mountain rills.
Love in their eyes,
Love in their sighs,
Love in the heave of each lily-bright bosom;
In words so clear,
Lest the listening ear
And the waiting heart may lose them.
O the silent Night, when the student dreams
Of kneeling crowds round a sage’s tomb;
And the mother’s eyes o’er the cradle rain
Tears for her baby’s fading bloom ;
O the peaceful Night, when stilled and o’er
Is the charger’s tramp on the battle plain,
And the bugle’s sound and the sabre’s flash,
While the moon looks sad over neaps of slain ;
And tears bespeak
On the iron cheek
Of the sentinel lonely pacing,
Thoughts which roll
Through his fearless soul,
Day’s sterner mood replacing.
O the sacred Night, when memory comes
With an aspect mild and sweet to me,
But her tones are sad as a ballad air
In childhood heard on a nurse’s knee ;
And round her throng fair forms long fled,
With brows of snow and hair of gold,
And eyes with the light of summer skies,
Aqd lips that speak of the days of old.
Wide is your flight,
O spirits of Night,
By strath, and stream, and grove,
But most in the gloom
Of the Poet’s room
Ye choose, fair ones, to rove.
D. H. DENIEHY.
AMANS AMARE.
A cottage small be mine, with porch
Enwreathed with ivy green,
And brightsome flowers with dew-filled bells,
’Mid brown old wattles seen.
And one to wait at shut of eve,
With eyes as fountain clear,
And braided hair, and simple dress.
My homeward step to hear.
On summer eves to sing old songs.
And talk o’er early vows,
While stars look down like angels’ eyes
Amid the leafy boughs.
When Spring flowers peep from flossy cells,
And bright-winged parrots call,
In forest paths be ours to rove
Till purple evenings fall.
The curtains closed, by taper clear
To read some page divine,
On winter nights, tlm hearth beside,
Her soft, warm hand in mine.
And so to glide through busy life,
Like some small brook alone
That winds its way ’mid grassy knolls,
Its music all its own.

COUGHS, GOLDS ON THE CHEST, BRON-
CHITIS AND ASTHMA RAPIDLY
CURED BY Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure.
Those who have taken this medicine are amazed
at its wonderful influence. Sufferers from any
form of bronchitis, distressing cough, difficulty of
breathing, hoarseness, pain or soreness in the
chest, experience delightful and immediate relief,
and to those who are subject to colds on the chest
it is invaluable, as it effects a complete cure. It
is most comforting in allaying tickling and irrita-
tion in the throat, and giving strength to the voice,
and it never allows a cough or asthma to become
chronic. No house should be without it, as, taken
at the beginning, a dose is generally sufficient,
and a complete cure is certain.
“ We, the undersigned, have had occasion to
obtain
HEARNE’S BRONCHITIS CURE,
and we certify that it is perfectly and rapidly suc-
cessful under circumstances which undoubtedly
prove its distinct healing power.” Signed by
Rev. JOHN SINCLAIR, Myers-street, Geelong,
and 59 other leading residents.
“Mr. W. G. Hearne,
“Dear Sir, —Some months ago my little boy got
very ill with bronchitis. My wife heard of your
Bronchitis Cure and got a bottle of it. The first
dose eased him, and less than half the bottle com-
pletely cured him. We always keep it in the
house now. I persuaded a friend of mine to try
it; lie did so, and it was just as successful with
his children. You are at liberty to make what
use you like of this, as I consider your Bronchitis
Cure to be a boon that cannot be too widely
known ; in fact, I cannot speak too highly of it.
—Yours very truly, ARTHUR G. JAMES,
Golden Square, Bendigo.
“Dear Sir, —I have much pleasure in informing
you that my father has been improving ever since
he started taking your Bronchitis Cure, and now
all signs of bronchitis have disappeared.—Yours
respectfully, THOS. PAYNE, Junr., Bloomfield,
Everton.”
“Will Mr. Hearne please send a bottle of his
Bronchitis Cure? I had one two or three months
ago which effected a speedy cure.—J. WYATT,
Newtown, Geelong.”
“Dear Sir,—l had occasion to use your Bron-
chitis Cure, and have been completely cured by
it.—Yours faithfully. J. H. WILLIAMS, Merles-
wood, Elsternwick.”

Rev. Haweis, discussing “Music and
Morals,” says “ the English National Anthem is
nothing but John Bull shouldering his way
through a crowd, knocking everybody out of his
road,” whilst “the frivolity and fickleness of the
French nation is exemplified in the Marseillaise.”
Ye gods ! there are force, and vigor, and fighting
in the dreadful, tailor-made “God Save the
Queen,” and only mincing femininity in “The
Marseillaise,” bred of revolution, and breathing
the fierce aspirations of a whole people battling for
freedom !
Dear Bulletin, —Was Dr. B. W. Richard-
son’s book on “Drink,” which is used as a text-book
in Maoriland State schools, really written by the
alleged author? It is full of-blunders in elemen-
tary chemistry and physiology. And it is ridi-
culous from a literary point of view. He gives a
quotation from Pythagoras (p. 150), whereas we
have nothing left of Pythagoras’ writings. He
calls the last stage of drunkenness (p. 104) “com-
plete concatenation of circumstances.” He con
fuses the arteries with the capillaries (p. 97), and
says the latter have muscular coats. He say-
(p. 76) that water consists of two parts hydrogen
and one part oxygen. This would terribly confuse a
teacher, and is absolutely wrong, because you can see
by the next page (in which bespeaks of carbon) that
he means, if he means anything, parts by weight.
The writer of pp. 75 to 79 evidently did not know
what a chemical formula such as CH4O (methyl
alcohol) meant. And, generally speaking, the
book is quite unfit for school use. The whole
drink question turns on the simple fact that
alcohol does indisputedly cause crime. Whether
it is a food or not is quite beside the question, for
it is so expensive that nobody would seriously use
it for that purpose. What you want to tell
children is that good potable spirit can be made
for about 2s. per gallon, and when we pay 6d. a
nip we not only pay 15s. a gallon to the Govern-
ment but the same or more to the publican, and
often get the spirit impure. They, when they get
older, must judge what legislation would minimise
the present evils.— W. F. Howlett, Makaretu,

By the centrifugal scattering forces at work
in early colonisation, many of the people most
interesting historically are projected to the re-
motest fringe of settlement. Hence we find in
Queensland, even far west and north, some of
those who form connecting Jinks between the pre-
sent and the early years of the parent province.
Yesterday, I met an old lady who, in her maiden
days, as Miss Williams, was lady’s-companion to
Miss Burke, and dressed her on the morning of
her marriage with E. Deas-Thomson. Mrs.
Thomson, by the way, was credited with writing
all her husband’s best speeches.

Here is an authentic snake story, reveal-
ing remarkable presence of mind. A Miss
M’Ewen, now Mrs. Ellis, lived with her mother
and sisters on the Brisbane River in a locality
notorious for black snakes. The girls were so
accustomed to these reptiles that the sudden
presence of one inspired no fear whatever. The
dairy was the great attraction for the snakes, as
they are very fond of milk. Family seated at
dinner. Kate M’Ewen called to the servant to
bring her a basin of milk. “The jug of milk is on
the table,” said her mother. “Bring me a basin
of milk and be quick about it,” said Kate, with-
out moving a muscle. The basin was handed to
her and she quietly placed it on the floor close
to her foot. Then a black snake slowly un-
coiled himself from the calf of her leg and
glided over to the milk. This is one of several
instances of Miss M'Ewen’s astonishing self-
possession. What would an ordinary man have
done in similar circumstances ?

.When our Crown Ministers were out on a
recent grand tour, to “ make ourselves acquainted,
Mr. Speaker, with all the wants of this great
country,’’ one of them, in a moment of deplorable
weakness unworthy of a modern statesman’s
dignity, asked a brother Minister, “Are we
fully justified in the expense of this little festivity
at the present time ?” To which the other, “ That
implies an abstruse problem in political ethics
which life is not long enough to solve ! Charley !
bring in another half-dozen of champagne! ”
Which recalls (I have just been reading American
papers) the two niggers in the fowl-house. “ Ain’t
it werry wrong to do this sort of thing?” said the
conscience-stricken partner. “ Dat involves a
great moral question which we ain’t got no time to
discuss. Hand down that big white rooster!”

The champion humorist among Australian
explorers was M‘Douall Stuart. "Referring to
hoisting the Union Jack on Central Mt. Stuart,
he says : “ We gave three cheers for the flag, the
emblem of civil and religious liberty, and may it
be a sign to the natives that the dawn of liberty,
civilisation and Christianity is about to break
upon them ! ” Only a Scotchman would indulge
in such reckless jocularity in the centre of a con-
tinent from the whole of whose living aboriginal
inhabitants, and the countless indignant ghosts
of those who were dead, there was even
then ascending to Heaven one deep, well-
founded curse on the day when the “emblem of
civil and religious liberty,” and those who carried
it, came in sight of the Australian coast!

A venerable pioneer, with a phenomenally
clear memory, was recently telling me that he was
a youth of 16 at Bathurst in 1826, when Holloway
kept the “ Bathurst Classical and Mercantile
School,” and the “Bathurst Hunt” Club rode
forth in green jackets turned up with velvet, a
dingo in gold on the collar, and gilt buttons with
“Bathurst Hunt” on them. He still owns two
of the buttons. The men with the clearest
memories are those who never learned to read. A
woman’s memory is usually more reliable than a
man’s.

An episode in the life of a Brisbane
society woman, who, after a long interregnum,
had a quite unexpected piccaninny. By way of
novelty she was seated on the bedroom floor wash-
ing the infant in a large washhand-basin. It was
her very first attempt, and she was nervous. The
plump little living “ roley-poley ” slipped out of
her hands and vanished in the soapsuds. Mamma
thereupon went promptly off into hysterics, and
when some woman heard the awful uproar and
rushed promptly into the room, she found the
infant sprawling on the floor in a pool of soapsuds
and mamba lying on her back beside the empty
basin, which she had fortunately kicked over in
the first excitement.

of “Haly,” late P.M. at Dalby, and one of the
squatting pioneers of Queensland, Charles Robt.
Haly and R. R. Mackenzie, our fifth Premier,
were returned for the Burnett to the first Parlia-
ment, in 1860. Haly had a station on the Logan
in 1845, and Dr. Lang stayed there, on his way
over from the Clarence, via Mt. Lindsay. Old
Haly was one of the whitest men in Queensland.
He had to bear much chaff in the House for his
advocacy of the natural grasses, especially the wild
carrot, and the use of salt. A wiser generation
may have good reason, and the necessary sense, to
remember old Haly’s prophecy.

tied to his feet sacks, in which he walked.
It is a grievous matter, moans R.C. Bishop
Doyle, that the Irish tongue should be neglected,
“seeing it is so much more perfect a language than
English.” The same silly claim has been made for
half-a-dozen other tongues by those who forget
that language is a tool, and that the most “per-
fect ” tool is the one that works best. Philological
symmetry is but an accident of language—practi-
cal utility is the surviving essential; which is
why, despite protesting shrieks about theoretical
perfection, it is always English that “goes !”

There is at least one man in Melbourne—
a journalist, by the way—who now wouldn’t pay
sixpence for a peep at the most irnnroper ballet on
earth. The thought of a SultanVharem in gauze
robes de nuit has no charms for him. At one fell
swoop ho has exhausted all the possibilities of
spicy spectacle, and his contempt for Living Pic-
tures is profound. A few weeks back the jour-
nalist in question was waiting about the marine
premises connected with a suburban ladies’ swim-
ming-bath, when a pale-faced woman rushed
forth from the inner sanctum and implored him to
come and save a drowning friend. There was no
time to waste in considering one’s reputation as a
modest married man. A human life was at stake,
and a strange female was tugging at his coat-tails,
so the journalist made his way to the bathing
reserve, where 200 women, some of them screaming
in the water and the others shrieking from the
platform, directed his attention to their sister in
distress. He plunged into the ocean and, being
an excellent swimmer, rescued the insensible
bather without much difficulty. The poor woman
had merely fainted, and a little brandy and mas-
sage soon restored her to consciousness. Then the
journalist became likewise conscious of what was
happening around him, and appreciated for the
first time the fact that he was revelling in an
unusual experience. The two hundred bathers
were now all out of the water, and clustering
round the rescue party. Those who had been
towelling themselves when the alarm started, had
forgotten to begin to dress, whilst many of the
remaining mermaids had broken loose from their
bathing apparel in the excitement of the moment,
and were gathered, wet and trembling, in the
background. The curious feature of the case was
their general indifference to the presence of a man
in their midst. True, he had all his clothes on,
and sticking to him. Perhaps the ladies thought
that his decent appearance leavened the whole
lump. But he didn’t. Like the right-minded
journalist that he was, the gallant hero gave one
hurried glance at the glittering array of flesh
and went off home to get dry.

“It is the most wonderful stuff I ever came
across. Please send me three boxes. I gave
some to a labourer of mine who had a bad boil
on his leg, and was quite lame. I saw him after
four days, and asked him what the “ Homocea ”
did for him. He said he was entirely cured ; his
wife, besides, had had a pain in her elbow, so
that she could not bend her arm for a year, and
it cured that. I also gave some to a woman with
a bad leg, and it is doing her good.”

Vou need not put off your canter
for the sake of a premonitory cold,
with Homocea as a protector.
A cold begins with inflammation of the membra-
neous lining of the intricate little passages of the
asst (which is a Hampton Court labyrinth on a
small scale). Homocea at once subdues the in
flimmation by reducing the swelling, and thereby
r Jieving the feeling of “stuffiness.” Moreover, it
firms a protective covering for the delicate mem
brane, and prevents cold air, or other irritating
vapour from getting at it. In influenza, Homocea
acts in the same way, and here the germ-killing
properties of the ointment further come into play -
Not much is known about the way in which influ
enza originates, but it is quite clear that it is caused
by an invisible germ or microbe of some kind.
Homcceamay,therefore, be confidently recomended.

EAGLE STREET, BRISBANE. Q.
Concerning a Dog-fight.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Dog-fighting as a sport is not much in
vogue nowadays. To -begin with, it iS illegal.
Nob that that matters much, for Sunday drinking
is also illegal, yet flourishes exceedingly. But
dog-fighting is one of the cruel sports which the
united sense of the community has decided to pub
down with all the force of public opinion. Never-
theless, a certain amount of dog-fighting is still
carried on around Sydney, and very neatly and
scientifically carried on, too principally by
gentlemen who follow the occupation of slaugh-
terers, and who live out Botany way and do not
care for public opinion.
* « •
The grey dawn was just breaking over
Botany when we got to the meeting-place. It was
Sunday morning, and all the respectable, non-
dog-fighting population of that stinking suburb
were sleeping the heavy, Sunday-morning sleep.
Away to the East the stars were paling at the
first faint flush of the coming dawn, and over the
sandhills came the boom of the breakers. An
intense stillness was over everything, and the
white-walled cottages of Botany were shrouded in
a faint mist. Some few people, however, were
astir. In the dim light hurried pedestrians might
be seen plodding their way over the heavy road
towards the sandhills. Now and then a van,
laden with about 10 or 11 of “the talent,” and
drawn by a horse that cost 15s. at auction, rolled
softly along in the same direction. These were
dog-fighters who had got “the office,” and knew
exactly where the chewing-match was to take
place.
» # #
The “meet” was on a main road, about
half-a-mile from town, and here some 200 people
had assembled, and hung up their horses and
vehicles to the fence without the slightest conceal-
ment. They said the police would not interfere
with them, and, in truth, they did not seem a
nice crowd to interfere with. One dog was on
the ground when we arrived. He had come out
in a hansom cab with his trainer, and was a white
bull-terrier, weighing about 40 pounds, “ trained
to the hour,” with the muscles standing out all
over him. He waited in the cab, and licked his
trainer’s face at intervals, to reassure that indi-
vidual of his protection and support. The rest of
the time he glowered out of the cab and eyed the
public scornfully. He knew as well as any human
being that there was sport afoot, and he looked
about eagerly and wickedly to see what he could
get his teeth into. Then a messenger came run-
ning up to the cab and demanded to know, with
a variety of expletives, whether they meant to sib
in the cab till the police came : also, he said that
the other dog had arrived and all was ready. The
trainer and dog got out of the cab, and we
followed through a fence and over a rise, and
there, about 200 yards from the main road, was a
neatly-pitched enclosure like a prize-ring — i.e., a
30-foot-square enclosure formed with stakes and
ropes. About a hundred people were at the ring-
side, and in the far corner, in the arms of his
trainer, was the other brindle.
« # *
It was wonderful to see the two dogs when
they caught sight of each other. The white dog
came up to the ring straining at his leash, nearly
dragging his trainer off his feet in his efforts to
get at the enemy. At intervals he emitted a
hoarse roar of challenge and defiance. The
brindled dog never uttered a sound. He fixed his
eyes on his adversary with a look of intense
hunger, of absolute yearning for combat. He
never for an instant shifted his unwinking gaze.
He seemed like an animal who saw the hopes of
years about to be realised. With painful earnest-
ness he watched every detail of the other dog’s
toilet; and while the white dog was making fierce
efforts to get at him, he stood Napoleonic, grand
in his courage, waiting for the fray.
• • •
All details were carefully attended to, and
all rules strictly observed. Most people think a
dog-fight is a go-as-you-please outbreak of lawless-
ness, but there are rules and regulations—simple,
but effective. Possibly one could even buy a book
containing the rules of dog-fighting. There were
two umpires, a referee, a timekeeper, and two
seconds for each dog. The stakes were said to be
JHO a-side. After some talk, the dogs were carried
to the centre of the ring by their seconds and pub
on the ground. Like a flash of lightning they
dashed at each other, and the fight began. Nearly
everyone has seen dogs fight—“it is their nature
to,” as Dr. Watts puts it. But an ordinary worry
between (say) a retriever and a collie, terminating
as soon as one or other gets his ear bitten, gives a
very faint idea of a real dog-fight. These bull-
terriers are the gladiators of the canine race. Bred
and trained to fight, carefully exercised and dieted
for weeks beforehand, they come to the fray exult-
ing in their strength and each determined to win.
E toh is trained to fight for certain holds, a grip
of the ear or the back of the neck being of very
slight importance. The foot is a favorite hold ;
the throat is, of course, fashionable—if they
can get it. These dogs sparred and wrestled
and gripped and threw each other fighting
grimly, and disdaining to utter a sound
under the most severe punishment. Their
seconds dodged round them unceasingly, giv-
ing them encouragement and advice. “That’s
the style, Boxer—fight for his foot.” “Draw
your foot back, old man,” and so on. Now
and again one dog got a grip of the other’s
foot and chewed savagely, and the specta-
tors danced with excitement. The moment
the dogs released hold of each other they
were snatched up by their seconds and carried to
their corners, and a minute’s time was allowed, in
which their mouths were washed out and a cloth
rubbed over their bodies.
# * #
Then came the ceremony of “ coming to
scratch.” After the first round, on time being
called, the brindled dog was let loose in his own
corner of the ring, and he was required by the
rules bo go across the ring (some 30ft.) of his own
free will and attack the other dog. If he failed
to do this he would lose the fight. The white
dog, meanwhile, was held in his corner waiting
the attack. After the next round it was the
white dog’s turn to make the attack, and so on
alternately. It, therefore, became evident that
the animals need not fight a moment longer than
they chose, as either dog could abandon the fight
by failing to go across the ring and attack his
enemy. While thefr condition lasted they used to
dash across the ring at full run ; but, after a
while, when the punishment got severe and
their “fitness” began to fail, it became a very
exciting question whether or not a dog would
“ come to scratch.” The brindled dog’s condi-
tion was nob so good as the other’s, and he
used to lie on his stomach between the rounds to
rest himself, and it several times looked as if he
would not cross the ring when his turn came. But
as soon as time was called he would start to his
feet and come limping slowly across glaring
steadily at the other dog; then, as he gob nearer, he
would quicken his pace and at last make a savage
rush, and in a moment they would be locked in
combat. So they battled on for 56 minutes till
the white dog (who was apparently having all the
best of it), on being called on to cross the ring,
only went half-way across and stood there growl-
ing savagely till a minute had elapsed, and so he
lost the fight.
» m *
No doubt it was a brutal exhibition.
Bub it was nob cruel to the animals in the
same sense that pigeon-shooting or hare-hunt-
ing is cruel. The dogs are born-fighters, anxious
and eager to fight, desiring nothing better. What-
ever limited intelligence they have is all directed
to this one consuming passion. They could stop
when they liked, but anyone looking on
could see that they gloried in the combat.
Fighting is like breath to them—they must
have it. Nature has implanted in all animals
a fighting instinct for the weeding out of the
physically unfit, and these dogs have an extra
share of that fighting instinct. Of course, now
that the world is going to be so good, and we are
all to be teetotal and only fight in debating
societies, and the women are to wear the breeches,
these nasty, savage animals are out of date, and
we will not be allowed to have anything more
quarrelsome than a poodle about a house—though
even poodles will fight like demons when they feel
like it. And the gamecock and the steeplechase-
horse and all animals with sporting or fighting
instincts must be done away with. Guineapigs
will, perhaps, be safe to keep, though even they
have a go-in at one another occasionally. And
the man of the future, the New Man, whose fight-
ing instincts are not quite bred out of him, will,
perhaps, be found at grey dawn of a Sunday morn-
ing with a crowd of other unregenerates in some
backyard frantically cheering on two determined
buck-guineapigs to mortal combat.

nal, tells a more remarkable story. An Egyptian
officer was killed while lying asleep bn his bed-
stead by a bullet that could not have copie from

danger of giving policemen firearms for use in

Dear Bulletin, —“ Why are bulls more
savage in England than Australia?” The English
beast has had a reputation thrust upon him and is
assisted to live up to it. He has for generations
been a comic “property,” and occupies the same
place in the stock of the British bludgeon-humorist
as the coon Johnsing, with the chicken or melon,
does in that of his Yankee congener. Also, every
writer of commonplace country stories has worked
in that fearsome bull, and made him the medium
by which the stalwart young man with the
London Journal legs displays heroic presence of
mind and ousts the bold bad baronet from the
affections of the distressed damsel. The conse-
quence is that when & town young person
of either sex happens across a beast in the
country that is nob a calf and doesn’t quite
seem a cow, they give a wild shriek and
stampede for the nearest fence. The same
result would happen with Australian cattle if
people in a strange dress indulged in the same
procedure. Further —bulls, like other beasts, are
much as you bake them. In Australia man is lord
of the beasts—or thinks so, which is much the
same. In England nine-tenths of the people, un-
accustomed to animals, wouldn’t stay to argue the
point. Possibly, also, the sad Australian bush
may have the same depressing effect on bulls as on
bush poets. For the rest the Australian bull has
an out-door life, natural feed, little restraint, and
a fair amount of female society. The English
animal is cramped for space, ramps with good
living, wears a ring in his nose, has his amours
regulated by a man in hob-nailed boots with a
clay pipe, and—has his reputation to consider. —

\The King of Thnekeepensl
The works of a watch are its
chief essential. The works of
the Apex watch equal in all
regards those of high-class silver
and gold watches costing trom
£7 to £l5.
The untarnishable case of the
Apex Watch is of nickel,
beautifully engine-turned, wit i
star and garter. ISo more elegant
or compact watch can be bought
for money.
The Apex Watch is a keyless
short-winder : ten turns wind it
for 24 hours. The keyless work
is extra strong, with safety barrel
The watch is thoroughly regu-
lated and timed tor immediate
use, and will last as long, with
even the roughest wear, as any
watch for which you pay 20 tunes
the money.

(Published at Sydney, N.S.W.)
The Unique Weekly—Australia's Nonpareil

“The Bulletin,"
Premier Australian Literary Journal,
It the only paper which hat a consistent and dis

The Bulletin favours—
A Republican Form of Government.
One Person, one Vote.
Complete Secularisation and Freedom of State
Education.
Reform of the Criminal Code and Prison
System.
A United Australia and Protection agains

Australia for the Australians.—The ohea]

The direct_ election of Ministers by Farlia

A new Parliamentary System—one House to

the other to be chosen by the whole
country voting as one Constituency.
A Universal System of Compulsory Life

The entire Abolition of the Private Owner

The Referendum.
The Abolition of Titles of so-called “nobility.
Ihe public eye rejects as uninteresting mor
than half of what appears in the newspapers o
the day. It is only the remainder that is founc
in The Bulletin.
The Bulletin is an aggressive Democratic
paper which strives to exclude from its artisti
cally-oondensed columns all matter that is no
of general human interest. The Bulletin wa
started 13 years ago with no capital but brains
and has become the representative Australian
journal, because it possesses a vitality lacker
by the countless news paper-ventures in wind
Australian capitalists have unavailingly spen
large fortunes.
The Bulletin’s conductors claim that ever;
progressive paper on the Australian continent ha
more or less endeavoured to profit by its, example
and follow its lines. The result of its powerfu
influence and its unprecedented literary and com
mercial success can at once be seen by comparing
the methods pursued by the Australian daily anc
weekly press prior to arid immediately after th
first issue of The Bulletin.
From the date of The Bulletin’s inaugura
publication its success was assured. It had a
once a dozen more or less servile imitators, many
of which even took, so far as was possible, its
name. They are now all dead, while The Bul
letin continues the one phenomenal success in
Australian journalism, the one completely non-
local and distinctly universal Australasian news-
paper.
The Bulletin proprietary have spent some
thousands of pounds in fitting their buildings
with the latest appliances for high-class printing
and the production of illustrations, and they have
now issued The Bulletin in an entirely new
form—printed with new type of improved legi-
bility on the finest paper, and adorned with
sketches from the hands of the ablest and best-
paid newspaper artists Australia has ever seen.
The Bulletin is the only well-established Aus-
tralian journal which, throughout its career, has
been consistently Radical, It points with pride
to the fact that for years it stood alone among
secular newspapers in advocating the Irish
National Cause, and that it was the only Aus-
tralian journal which denounced the Soudan
Expedition from its inception.
The Bulletin is the beacon-fire of national
progress : it is the forceful summons to the
crusade against the monopolies in land, wealth,
power, and privilege—the direct cause of half the
misery which now afflicts British humanity.
Against the claims of avaricious clergy who claim
to monopolise salvation, against the dark despotism
of grasping plutocrats, and against the exercise of
any human authority which has not been granted
by the people over whom it is exercised, The
Bulletin will fearlessly and ruthlessly contend.
The Bulletin, unlike the ordinary weekly
journal, is not loaded with a weight of matter
transferred from the columns of a daily paper
issued from the same office. The Bulletin is
not connected with any other paper, and the
matter it contains is all specially prepared by its
own unequalled staff.
The Bulletin is the journal which, of all Aus-
tralian journals, is most frequently quoted in Eng-
land, America, and the colonies.
The Bulletin, which is the only paper sold
by runners in the streets of every Australasian
capital, is the most widely-circulated of all papers
published south of the equator, and is the only
Australasian publication which enjoys a popu-
larity unhampered by the political boundaries
that so closely restrict other journals to the
colonies in which they are printed.
The Bulletin’s red cover is equally familiar
to the bushman of the Far North, the stockman
of Central Australia, the pearl-sheller of Torres
Straits, and the digger in the Maoriland
Ranges. A paper which is at once the most
popular city publication and the organ of the
intelligent bushman must indeed be broadly based.
Perhaps the strongest proof of The Bulletin’s
popularity is found in the unchallengeable fact—
easily ascertainable from any postal official—that,
of all journals issued in Australasia, The Bul-
letin is the one most frequently remailed from
one reader to another.
The Bulletin is going ahead faster than an
other paper, because its vast mass of original an
specially written reading matter is the brightest
and best, its illustrations th>. cleverest and most
artistic, and its policy the boldest and most
straightforward ever submitted to the Australian
public.
