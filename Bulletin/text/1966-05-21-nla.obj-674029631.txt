A paradise 'lost’... that’s fast becoming 'found’
If you are a moon-and-sixpence type,
ride the white waves across Kovalam
Bay the most beautiful surf beach in
India’s lush southland. Or beach-loaf
on soft, white sands at Mahabali-
puram amid 7th Century temples
carved from solid rock. If you crave
excitement, load your camera and
head for a Game Sanctuary like
Bandipur. Journey back into the past,
explore the awesome temple city of
Kanchipuram. Or discover modern
India the Krishnarajasagar Dam
project and colourfully lit Brindavan
Gardens. Now, catch your breath and
relax luxuriously in romantic Mysore
city.
Whatever your idea of a tropical,
away-from-it-all paradise may be,
you’ll find it in South India. It begins
ideally in Madras, gateway to the
South.
May we host your next trip abroad?
Be our guest for a few days, a few
weeks or make it a complete holiday.
AIR-INDIA knows India and we
know best how to please you most.

Rent Control
Sir,
It was indeed a pleasure to read Mr.
Clyne’s article on rent control (B. May 7).
Your journal is to be congratulated on
having the courage to publish such a clear
and convincing story of this era’s greatest
injustice.
Mr. Clyne’s article was lacking in one
aspect only: the enormous cost to N.S.W.
occasioned by the iniquitous Landlord
and Tenant Act. It has been estimated
by reliable authorities that the cost of
the Rent Control Office and all its rami-
fications throughout the State is well over
$1,000,000 per year. To this cost must
be added other important costs to this
State which will go on and on for ever.
I refer to the loss of Land Tax occasioned
by property owners disposing of large hold-
ings bearing maximum rate of tax, in
parcels which in future will be free of
tax.
I refer also to the many citizens of this
State who are ashamed of being citizens
of a State which can perpetuate an injus-
tice which its own Liberal Premier des-
cribes as “a shameful position which cries
out for adjustment” (though his party is
cravenly willing to do nothing about it)
and who are leaving such a State, thus
causing an enormous loss of death duties,
stamp duties, etc., and the general spend-
ing power of wealthy citizens. I also refer
to the loss to this State of many large
charitable bequests which in future will
go elsewhere.

Dr. Davidson’s Torment
Sir,
The Ord River Project dangles before
the eyes of Dr. Bruce Davidson as a
perpetual torment to his soul. His fre-
quent effusions would be amusing were
they not so damaging in their effect upon
the national economy.
Now he proposes (B. May 7) that the
Commonwealth make an annual gift of
£2OOO to each farmer and farm laborer
on the Ord River Project to live in the
area and do nothing while we import the
cotton we require.
The doctor, by the way, ignores the fact
that the cotton growers of Narrabri, Wee
Waa, and Coleambilly, as also those of
Queensland, are recipients of subsidies: so

In any major building project today there
are miles of steel pipe and fittings. Pipes
for water, gas, heating, steel tubes for
scaffolding, balustrades, roof trusses,
stanchions. All are obtainable from
Stewarts and Lloyds who for more than
a century have been handling steel tube.
The large number of Tubular steel struc-
tures and installations built and building
all over Australia also shows the growing
popularity of steel tube as a structural
medium. There is a Stewarts and Lloyds
branch in all capital cities ready to advise
or service you.

also are the tobacco growers and the dairy
farmers. All these subsidies, together with
the Sugar Bounty, are essential, due to
our many - sided devices by means of
tariffs, wage fixing, and Social Services
designed to assist our people maintain a
high standard of living.
The suggestion of the doctor that we
abandon the completion of the Ord Pro-
ject is not now feasible, for he should
know if he ever visited the larger pro-
ject that its construction is simple; in
fact, a gift from the gods, due to its re-
markable suitability for damming at a cost
of less than half of that of Lake Eucum-
bene on the Snowy River Project and im-
pounding seven times more water than
Sydney Harbor. Furthermore, its con-
struction is an absolute necessity if the
work on the present section is not to be
destroyed by soil erosion and silting, which
the larger dam will prevent. We cannot
at this stage dishonor our obligations to
the settlers established there at consider-
able expense to themselves. They were
led to believe that the completed scheme
would bring into being some 230 farms
and with their establishment the greater
amenities needed.
I have personally visited this project
three times and am about to make my
fourth visit next July. It is an inspiring
scheme and a tribute to its founders, but
it needs the guiding hands of statesmen
not agronomists.
The Ord Project will be an outstanding
pattern for the development of all the
other fast-flowing rivers of the north,
whose waters now wastefully flow into the
Indian Ocean. Believe it or not, its
completion will be a test as to whether
we can hold this great continent or lose
it. It will also be a test as to whether
the Holt Government is worthy of sur-
vival.

Film Festival
Sir,
Charles Higham’s description of the
Sydney Film Festival in “Housing the
Blockbusters” (B. April 30) as “a group of
oldish films already in the country, con-
sulate’s offerings (and) a few lucky items
lent with generosity by overseas countries”
is misleadingly wide of the mark. Only
three features to be shown at the 13 th
Festival this June could fit any of these
categories; in fact, 25 features are being
specially sent to the Festival by their over-
seas producers.
“Very little really new?” Seventeen of
these features were made in 1965 and
seven in 1964.
“Not significantly of the year in ques-
tion?” The Festival does not operate in
competition with local distributors or ex-
hibitors in their current negotiations. For
13 years, however, it has provided Sydney’s
serious filmgoers and film trade with the
opportunity of seeing a discriminating
selection of important films, many of them
prize-winners at overseas festivals, which
unless subsequently purchased for Austra-
lian distribution would never be seen here.
DAVID J. STRATTON
Director, Sydney Film Festival
Sydney (N.S.W.)
Charles Higham replies: Mr. Stratton —
who, incidentally, expressed his approval
of my article to me in person—is simply
dodging the issue. The films made in
1964 and 1965 are not “really new” at
all. What I was asking for—and he knows
this very well—was a Festival which would
show films “significantly of the year in
question”—i.e., 1966, as Festivals do over-
seas.
Sydney’s Orchestra
Sir,
In reviewing the Sydney Symphony
Orchestra’s last two concerts (B. May 14),
Paul Frolich has been lamenting the
recent drop in standards of the group as
a whole. I feel it is grossly misleading of
any critic to infer that due to imagined
conductor difficulties, unexplained resigna-
tions, and a temporary fall in standards,
that any given group of players is on a
downhill slide; and this is the firm impres-
sion gained from his article.

Had Mr. Frolich gone to the trouble of
pointing out that all the “key” players
who left the orchestra have gone to new
positions, with the aim of ensuring the
future of our orchestras, his passing re-
marks would have been acceptable. Every
time we import an orchestra from over-

players resign and conductors or orchestras

Vietnam’s Wherefors
Sir,
As an Australian living in the United
States, I have been bitterly disappointed
at your inadequate coverage of the issues
involved in the Vietnamese war. You seem
to be under the misapprehension that as
long as the Australians are fighting well
and “doing a good job” there is nothing
further to be discussed. Unfortunately,
you go so far as to print an article
entitled “The Diggers of Bien Hoa,” which
deliberately links this war with World
War II and Korea. (8., April 23.)
This is hypocrisy of the first order. To
appeal to the Australian patriotic senses
and at the same time to avoid the real
issues is to deny the basic right of all
intelligent Australians to question or agree
with the Government’s policies. The point
being that patriotism without reason is
absurd and can be dangerous. Patriotic
articles on Australian forces in one of
the most significant battle areas of the
world today are equally absurd without
a knowledge of the whys and wherefors.
The dominating question here is not
patriotism or Army tactics. It is the
reasoning behind the U.S. involvement
and the results of this involvement in
South-East Asia (past, present, and
future). This is the question the Austra-
lian Government must consider and recon-
sider continually. It is well known that
Holt was reluctant at first to commit him-
self to a large defence expenditure. Yet
one of the principal reasons for the recent
increase of troops and money was as a
result of American requests for additional
support.
Australians have as much a need for
informed opinion and criticism of Ameri-
can policies as the Americans do. We
can’t be ostriches and just hope for the
best, while sending another 3000 men to
fight for their lives in this dirty war.
SEATO countries have an obligation and
a right 'to insist on international super-
vision and controls, preferably through the
UN. Australia is able to exercise some
control, but why is the Australian Govern-
ment holding back? Why are the pro-
testors so small in number and so
despised? Is it ignorance, misinformation,
or just plain stupidity?
(MRS.) CHRISTINE FOX
Sausalito, California (U.S.A.).
Reassessing China
Sir,
Your correspondent R. Slessor points
to the economic achievements of Taiwan
and the need for closer diplomatic and
trade ties. (8., May 7.)
This is all the more urgent in these
days of easy talk about “reassessing” re-
lations with Red China. The Peking Com-
munists cannot destroy Taiwan by military
force, as they would like to do. Tai-
wan’s own powerful defences and the U.S.
Seventh Fleet have prevented that. But
the destruction of Free China remains a
vital ingredient in their plans. Taiwan
indicates to all of Asia that its economic
problems can be solved without Commu-
nism. It is a key point in the free world’s
defence system. It ties up a large part
of the Red Army, Navy, and Air Force.
It has kept the allegiance of most of the
14 million overseas Chinese. It is well
governed, orderly, and prosperous. In
spite of every effort, the Communists can-
not hide Taiwan’s achievements from all
their people all the time—hence the con-
tinued flow of refugees to Taiwan, Quemoy,
and Matsu. ;
Frustrated militarily at present, Peking
hopes to isolate Taiwan diplomatically
and drive her from the international com-
munity, clearing the road for conquest.
Peking will not condescend to join -the
United Nations unless the Nationalist
Chinese are expelled. The danger of “re-
assessment” talk is that it may lead to a
one-way traffic in which the free world,
anxious for peace, will give everything
and gain nothing from Peking, which is
indifferent to peace. It is time we saw
clearly who are our friends in Asia and
who are our enemies. Taiwan is a firm
friend and deserves all the encourage-
ment we can give.

Company Policemen
/"YNE N.S.W. company director has
gone to jail this month; another
two have been committed for trial;
summonses have been issued against
six others. In Victoria an official re-
port describes the top man in a huge
financial empire as “wholly unfit to
direct any company” in which the
public has money, and two public
company directors are already in
jail. The fact that most of these
actions and reports relate to events
of four or five years ago, or their
results, is no consolation to those who
have lost their money and consider
that something has gone badly wrong
with business morality.
Two points stand out if we are to
ensure that these disasters do not
happen again on this scale. The first
is that part of the trouble stemmed
from lack of supervision of company
activities by the honorable and busy
men who sit on many company
boards. There has clearly been far
more carelessness than dishonesty in
some company failures of recent
times, as boards of directors have
allowed incompetent executives to
run their companies. It is obviously
impossible for a professional man
who sits on a dozen or so boards of
big companies to know what is going
on in them or even to have the time
to find out. He inevitably sometimes
accepts, in good faith, certain infor-
mation given him as true, which
may, in fact, be false. Yet, in almost
all the big company failures there
has been this pattern of honest direc-
tors misled by an incompetent or
dishonest chief executive.
Clearly this kind of director must
either find a way of protecting him-
self from rogues or get off these
boards.
Secondly, there is still great
scope of improvement not by making
more laws that hamstring the honest
and enterprising director but by
making certain that the existing laws
are properly policed by skilled and
able professional investigators.
The lack of adequate machinery
to enforce the laws has enabled both
dishonest men and self-deluding
incompetent men to build big finan-
cial empires that collapsed with so
much of the public’s money at the
end of the last boom. They
flourished not because there were
more dishonest or incompetent men
running companies than were run-
ning other activities in the community,
but because it all seemed so easy
during the boom. The boom’s end
brought the need for desperate
measures to keep their houses of
cards standing—and it was then that
the lack of an effective policing force
really told.
In recent years the staff of trained
investigators made available to the
Registrars of Companies in each State
has been increased. But this has not
gone nearly far enough. The com-
plexities of the company law and the
massive expansion in company activity
in recent times mean that these offi-
cial organisations must keep pace with
this progress if the dismal news of
this month is not to be repeated.
The striking fact about this
period of our business history is that
the supply of able managers has not
been large enough to keep pace with
the . rapid expansion of industry and
commerce. Therefore the need for
proper supervision, both internally
(by the boards of directors) and
externally (through the Registrar’s
investigators) has never been greater.


BUSINESS
Rocking the Establishment
NOTHING quite like last week’s summonses had ever happened before in Sydney.
But the significance of the news was not that six more former H. G. Palmer
(Consolidated) Ltd. directors had been charged with issuing a false prospectus.
What was significant lay in four of the
six names listed. They were four mem-
bers of the Sydney financial establishment,
headed by Sir Norman Nock, the former
chairman of H. G. Palmers. The others
were the accountant, Mr. R. N. Cadwalla-
der; the former MLC deputy general
manager, Dr. A. H. Pollard; and the
solicitor, B. J. D. Page.
These men sit on many highly respected
public company boards; Mr. Cadwallader’s
directorships spread over nine public com-
panies, Sir Norman’s over seven, and Mr.
Page is on some impressive bank, hire
purchase, insurance, and brewery boards.
Whatever may be the outcome of these
summonses, the startling charges remove
any suggestion that by issuing only three
summonses in this matter in the first in-
stance —to Mr. H. G. Palmer himself, the
company secretary, Mr. W. H. Rose, and
the auditor, Mr. J. Mcßlane —the authori-
ties were unfairly discriminating against
the smaller names that had also appeared
in the prospectus complained about. Now
everyone is on the list, including the two
remaining directors, Mr. N. H. Palmer
and Mr. C. H. Trenam.
Victorian company authorities have also
shown themselves to be no respecters of
persons. In Victoria, some most respected
men have been found guilty of breaches
of the companies acts, and fined. Two
public company directors have been sent
to jail.
In N.S.W., a fortnight ago, a Sydney
accountant, Mr. Reginald Clyde Moulton,
was sent to jail for two years for a
“cruel fraud” on the public by issuing
a false prospectus —a charge made possible
only by the 1961 Companies Act.
Two more men, Louis Steen and his
son Joseph, were committed for trial last
week over their running of International
Vending Machines.
Long as is the growing list of directors
against whom the N.S.W. Government is
proceeding, there are still many instances
of company failures where allegations of
fraud or dishonest practices have not re-
sulted in successful prosecutions.
The problem has been in getting a
charge that would stick.
To some extent this has been due to the
inadequacies of the previous Companies
Act. But it also seems likely that there
has not been enough support given to the
Companies Registrars in each State to
initiate enquiries when they have been
felt necessary.
The hardworking pair of public ser-
vants, Frank Ryan in N.S.W.. and John
Finemore in Victoria, have done a remark-
able amount of work in trying to show
that the new companies acts and amend-
ments they sweated so hard to introduce,
can be properly administered.
But all these prosecutions do not mean
that there is something radically wrong
with Australian business. The hothouse
conditions of the boom of the late 1950 s
enabled some companies to grow like card
houses in a way that would never have
been possible at other times. The lack of
effective controls and deterrents at that
time had the same effect as it would have
H. G. Palmer—now a long list.
on any section of the community—it en-
couraged the crooks and incompetents.
This has damaged the fabric of
“people’s capitalism,” of the small in-
vestor having a stake in ownership, and
the sharp fall in stock exchange turnover
against a sharp rise in deposits with
savings banks and building societies is
evidence enough of that.

Zealand. Mr. Stanley Korman set his own
standards of financial practice and
honesty but always seemed to be mov-
ing within legal bounds. He had an answer
for everything and a power of command
over his cohorts which made them accept
his dictates and procedures without
question even when ultimately his
financial manouvres resulted in the loss
of millions to the public investing in his
enterprises. Even more remarkably,
crowded meetings of debenture and share
Stanley Korman —the image builder.
holders who had lost virtually all they had
invested in his companies voted
enthusiastically to follow him to what
always looked to me like probable demise.
Mr. Murphy’s searching first report last
year on Stanhill Development Finance
seemed hot, although so far it has not
been hot enough either to keep Mr. Kor-
man or any of his associates in court for
long on Companies Act charges or indeed
to stop Mr. Korman in his business tracks.
In taking his investigation a stage fur-
ther by examining the affairs of Factors
Ltd., Mr. Murphy has gone far deeper
into the group’s financial manouvres. For
this was the darling of the Korman com-
panies, the one Mr. Korman chose in
1958 to be the fulcrum on which those
yet to be built would largely move. In-
deed, it has been the only one of his
Australian public companies to survive
liquidation or receivership.
This second report, as well as sparing
Korman’s reputation nothing as a com-
pany director, alleges much more widely
and strongly than the first that the legal
bounds have been broken. It is a masterly
exposition, most patiently undertaken, of


Korman in action as the controller of an
empire built on. public money and falling,
not so much as economic realities and
Government measures (the 1960-61 credit
squeeze) close in, (as Korman still per-
sistently maintains) but as Korman’s fore-
sight proves faulty and his directorial and
managerial capacities fail to measure up to
the grand design.
Mr. Murphy makes much of Korman’s
incredible capacity to inspire confidence,
to inflate and fashion a favorable public
image for himself and his interests, par-
ticularly the shares of his companies. He
would use every device, including allegedly
attempting to prostitute the financial press.
A case is cited in the report of loans
of £BOOO being made to a financial
journalist, only £3OOO of which was re-
paid.
Commenting on this Mr. Murphy says,
“If this loan was, as Mr. Carrodus
(financial director) told me, an ordinary
business loan, no one has explained to
me why no proceedings have been taken
to recover it. But if, as I believe, the
loan was made with the intention of giving
the recipient a personal interest in the
maintenance of the successful image of
the companies, then the subsequent con-
duct of the directors of General Invest-
ments and Discounts Pty. Ltd. (one of
Factors’ 80 subsidiaries) can be under-
stood.” In my experience this is a unique
lapse on the part of the Press in this
country. The paper concerned, the Mel-
bourne “Herald” has been big enough to
apologise in a leading article.
Perhaps the most astonishing aspects of
the report lie in the inter-company trans-
fer of funds, particularly those out of
Rockmans into companies such as Chev-
ron Sydney which had no legal bond with
it. If this made an accountant’s night-
mare, it must have set Mr. Murphy the
puzzle of his life, as readers of the 220-
page report will attest.
The Melbourne “Herald,” May 11, 1966.
It was not expected that Mr. Murphy’s
first two reports would uncover the whole
truth about Korman’s enterprises. We
must wait at least for the third of the
trilogy, which the investigator is now
working on. True, Korman will probably
have more than enough bother from the
Attorney-General arising from the second
report. It would be surprising from now
on if he kept holding his head as high
in the company world as he has been
doing lately. However, the third report
on the two major public companies,
Chevron Sydney and Stanhill Consolidated
and the Korman family companies Stan-
hill Pty. Ltd. Dominion Pty. Ltd. and
Park Lane Pty. Ltd. (all of which Mr.
Murphy has already shown to have been
recipients of funds from the public com-
panies) is needed to make our next assess-
ment of the Korman play these past eight
years.

QUEENSLAND
Mr. Nicklin's Last Race
WITH an overwhelming feeling of having seen it all before, Queensland is
trudging through the three weeks of an election campaign which almost certainly
must return the Nicklin Government on May 28.
Last election’s speeches are being dusted
off, Labor men striking out “unemploy-
ment” and writing in “galloping prices,”
Government candidates extending their
comparison of public expenditure forward
three years for themselves, back three
years for Labor Governments of unblessed
memory.
Admittedly there is a new Liberal
leader, Mr. Gordon Chalk, in place of
Sir Alan Munro, who retired, and there
is a new QLP leader, Mr. Les Dip-
lock, in place of Mr. Paul Hilton, who
lost his seat in 1963 and has since died.
(One enthusiast hailed the end of the
QLP policy speech with a “Good on
yer, Dippy” which must be a record of
some sort.) But the two serious candidates
for Premier for the fourth and final time
are Mr. Nicklin and Mr. Duggan.
Mr. Nicklin has indicated that he will
retire during the next Parliament. Pre-
sumably he will stay in long enough to
break Forgan Smith’s Premiership record
of 10 years 3 months. Mr. Duggan, at 55,
is good for many more tries, and despite
occasional Press efforts to stir up a “Dump
Duggan” plot it is difficult to imagine
the State ALP without him. When Mr.
Nicklin goes, his mantle should fall to
the Minister of Education, Mr. Jack
Pizzey, provided that the Liberals have
not achieved their no longer very secret
ambition of becoming the majority partner
in the coalition.
Mr. Duggan has already warned that
Mr. Nicklin is aging and Mr. Pizzey has
had a heart attack, but, in fact, Mr.
Nicklin looks remarkably like he did in
1957 save for a few extra pounds, and
it is pretty hard to run against the health
of a possible Premier a few years off.
Mr. Nicklin responded smartly to Mr.
Duggan’s observations with a challenge to
a 100 yards foot race in which he would
give the Leader of the Opposition a few
yards.
But Mr. Duggan’s real trouble is that
Mr. Nicklin is the closest thing Australia
has had in recent years to General Eisen-
hower, or perhaps Joe Lyons. It’s hard to
get angry with him.
What excitement the campaign gener-
ates comes from the now celebrated three-
cornered contests in which Liberal and
Country Party candidates will confront
each other. If the Liberals should come
out on top in most of these, and if the
Dawson Federal by-election correctly pre-
dicts that dairymen and cane-growers are
discontented so that certain coastal seats
are lost by the Country Party, then the
Liberal Party could at last get the majority
of coalition seats to go with the majority
of coalition votes they have long provided.
Mr. Chalk has indicated that the Liberals
would soldier on behind Mr. Nicklin even
if they had a majority, but Mr. Pizzey has
no such public guarantee. However, both
possibilities for changing the composition
of the coalition are fairly long shots.
One three-cornered contest is in the
safe Labor seat of Cairns. Another is for
the Liberal marginal seat of East Too-
woomba, where the nearest thing the State
ALP has to Rex Patterson, a young school-
teacher named Peter Wood, might slip
in between the Government candidates.
In South Coast the Country Party candi-
date should get ALP preferences to win.
Two other three-cornered contests have
sitting Country Party members, the
Speaker at Murrumba north of Brisbane,
and Mr. Houghton in adjacent RedclifTe
who won the seat as an Independent after
a pre-selection row in the Country Party;
both are personally popular which could
cut the direction of ALP preferences to the
Liberal.
Similarly, to the south of Brisbane,
Logan has the local shire chairman stand-
ing for the Country Party, and ex-urban
overspill is more likely to favor Labor
than the Liberals. The one seat where it
is difficult to see how the Liberals can
fail to oust their senior partners is Albert,
where the local mayor, Ern Harley, has
run the sitting MLA, Cec Carey, to a
close finish while standing as an Indepen-
dent. With the Liberal ticket and ALP
preferences likely to go solidly to him
he got half when the ALP how-to-vote
card directed them to Carey he seems
a certainty.
Nor is it probable that irate primary
producers are ready to thump Mr. Nick-
lin as they were ready to lambast Mr.
Ho.lt. Dawson was a by-election in which
the fate of the Government was not at
stake. Few State ALP candidates have
the appeal of Dr. Patterson, and Govern-
ment MLAs have merely to hold on.
When Mr. Nicklin delivered his policy
speech at Maroochydore, it was the
Federal Minister for Primary Industry,
Mr. Adermann, who was heckled with
the cry of where had all the dairyfarmers
gone. In his policy speech, Mr. Nicklin
promised relief for sugar and dairying, and

I want to give them a good education. Well, Ampol helps there, giving grants

My main concern is the kind of future they can expect. I want them free to
choose the profession that suits them ... not forced to take just any job. And I
want security and prosperity for them.
Well, that is the kind of life Ampol is helping to build. Its earnings stay in Aus-

spoke particularly of the needs of the
drought-affected areas near Bundaberg,
where Dr. Patterson had done so well.
The ALP has hopes of picking up
several seats in the central coastal areas,
including those of two Ministers, Dr.
Delamothe in Bowen and Mr. Camm in
Whitsunday. Bowen has always been a
cliff-hanger since it was created in 1960,
and might be won, but a really hefty swing
would be needed to carry any State seats
along the Dawson path. Apart from East
Toowoomba, the ALP’s best prospects lie
in two seats held by ex-QLP Independents,
Bundaberg and Cook, to the north of
Cairns, where Mr. Duggan has already
complained of improper influence on the
newly enfranchised aborigines. Both In-
dependents have been left unopposed by
the Government parties, but they were
hard pressed in 1963, and any drift to the
ALP would turn them out.
In terms of policies, none of the four
leaders has broken very much new ground.
Mr. Duggan promised free textbooks, Mr.
Chalk a payment of $l5 per annum per
secondary student to independent schools.
Mr. Duggan and Mr. Diplock have called
fp r restoration of price control, Mr. Nick-
and Mr. Chalk, reinforced by the
Pluckrose report and the Commonwealth
Statistician’s index, deny that it is neces-
saU- Most Government sweeteners have
gone to the man on the land, which
would reflect the balance of power within
the coalition, but might merely indicate
where Cabinet thinks the real dangers lie.
Mr. Chalk agilely seized the reaction to
the Brisbane City Council’s increased bus
and tram fares to promised improved
suburban train services—to which com-
muters are returning.
But the overall effect in comparison,
S ay, wit h i as t year’s elections in New South
Wales and South Australia is of a fair
amount of room for imagination at the
top.

POLITICS
Labor’s Many Voices
WHEN Opposition Leader Arthur Calwell last week told the House of Represen-
tatives: “There is nobody in Europe today under 50 years of age who is a convinced
Communist,” jaws dropped on both sides of the Parliament.
The Government jaws dropped from dis-
belief at the capacity of any person to
advance that as a serious proposition;
some of the Labor jaws dropped from
dismay. Actually, what Calwell did with
that quite extraordinary declaration was to
negate his stand of a lifetime. He has
always insisted that he and Labor were
anti-Communist. Yet here he was saying
that in Europe Communism as a belief and
political program did not exist, except in
the minds of an aging generation that
was already shrinking in numbers and
would disappear as a significant factor
from the political scene within two de-
cades. The logical next step from that
proposition is that you do not oppose
Communism. There is no need to oppose
it. It no longer exists.
In the light of that statement it is
easy to understand why Labor, which
started the present Parliamentary session
with high hopes of doing well out of it
at the Federal elections later this year, is
ending the session with its prospects un-
enhanced.
It could be argued that with Sir Robert
Menzies now gone from the political stage
and his successor as Prime Minister,
Harold Holt, not yet firmly in the saddle,
Labor would have been well advised to
replace Mr. Calwell as leader with his
deputy, Mr. Gough Whitlam, a man whose
addiction to the kind of statement that
Calwell’s one on Communism represented
is less marked. But, as I see it, the
elevation of Whitlam to the leadership
would have solved nothing. The way he
went about his unsuccessful attempt to
secure the leadership exacerbated feelings
so harshly that all that would have hap-
pened if he had gone into the leadership
would have been that he, instead of Cal-
well, would have become the target for
anti-leader hostility.
Apart from being an illustration of the
effectiveness of the brainwashing Calwell
has undergone since he made the fatal
decision to become a member of the
strongly Left-wing Victorian ALP Execu-
tive, his statement is more than just the
indiscretion of an aging leader who is
losing some of his grasp. It is a mani-
festation of the malady within the Labor
Party. This malady is that there are
viewpoints so diverse within the Labor
Party that it is really a near-miracle that
they have continued so long to exist under
the common label of “ALP.”
An aspect of this diversity is that there
has been going on over the past fortnight
an attempt to reconcile the conflicting
viewpoints of recognised party leaders on
the issue of Vietnam (which is associated
indirectly but clearly to the Labor Party’s
attitude on whether there’s the need to
contain Communism in Asia). When you
take just three major party leaders —
Calwell, Whitlam, and Dr. J. Cairns, who
is a potential Labor leader—their views on
Australia’s attitude toward Vietnam, and
what Australia should do about Australian
forces in Vietnam if Labor takes over the
reins of Federal Government at the end
of this year, are quite irreconcilable.
Calwell has announced that he will with-
draw all conscripts (Australian national
servicemen) immediately. Whitlam has
said that conscripts will be given an
opportunity to say whether or not they
want to be withdrawn or to volunteer to
complete their term. Cairns has said that
he wants a complete withdrawal, although
he proposes that this withdrawal should
be in association with, and after consul-
tation with, the United States.
On the initiative of Mr. L. Devine and
Mr. George Grey—whose son, a regular
soldier, left to serve in Vietnam a fortnight
or so ago the Federal Parliamentary
Labor Party Defence Committee and its
Foreign Committee have been holding a
series of unpublicised joint meetings over
the past fortnight in an attempt to get
some coherent policy out of the leaders’
conflicting statements.
At one stage it looked as though the
compromise proposal that would emerge
would lean heavily toward the Cairns
viewpoint—that there should be a com-
plete Australian withdrawal from Viet-
nam. But apparently the Chairman of
the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party,
Mr. Allan Fraser, another major Party
leader, got difficult. Fraser took the stand
that Australian involvement in Vietnam
and Australia’s use of national servicemen
in Vietnam were separate issues, and the
issue of the use of conscripts in Vietnam
should not be used to justify a policy of
total Australian withdrawal in Vietnam.
But Fraser’s view did not survive for
very long. After a special Caucus meet-
ing Mr. Calwell announced that a Labor
Government would withdraw national
servicemen from Vietnam immediately it
was elected, and then in consultation with
the United States work for the return of
all Australian forces from Vietnam as
soon as practicable’.
If I paint a confused picture, it is only
because the Labor Party is confused. It
is confusing when you have the Federal
Secretary of the ALP (Mr. Cyril Wynd-
ham) putting out on behalf of the ALP
an official pamphlet, “The Unbridgeable
Gulf,” setting out Labor’s fundamental
opposition to Communism and Calwell
enunciating the viewpoint of another sec-
tion of the Party when he tells you in
effect, “Forget Communism as a political
force—it is dead or within a relatively
few years of dying.”
It is similarly confusing to listen to
Calwell, Whitlam, Cairns, and others and
then try to work out what really is
Labor’s policy on Vietnam—as distinct
from its policy not to use national ser-
vicemen in Vietnam; This confusion
which exists both on Labor’s attitude to
Communism and on Vietnam extends to
other areas of Labor policy. And while
this confusion has manifested itself pub-
licly more clearly during the recent Parlia-
mentary session than for a long time, Holt
has been establishing himself increasingly
as Prime Minister in his own right rather
than as Menzies’ heir.
All in all, Labor cannot consider the
session, which ended last week, as one
which enhanced its political image. From
its viewpoint the worst feature must be
that its troubles went much deeper than
a personality clash between Calwell and
Whitlam. They involved basic policies.

Why do so many businessmen fly TAA?
Because TAA is a successful
business enterprise
TAA is a business enterprise required
to make a profit and pay a dividend just
like any other commercial undertaking.
And people naturally prefer to do business
with sound, competent enterprises.
The Airline is operated by the Australian
National Airlines Commission, in the same way
as a public company is controlled by a board of
directors.
U% DIVIDEND
TAA has a capital of $15,000,000, unchanged
since 1961.
Out of a net profit for 1964/65 of $1,409,052
TAA’s li% dividend to the Treasury absorbs
$1,125,000.
TAA PAYS TAX
TAA is subject to income tax, payroll tax, sales
tax, etc., normally met by other commercial en-
terprises, and has to pay special tax on aviation
fuel and air route charges as well.
In its operation TAA enjoys no special privi-
leges over its competitors. TAA must win every
passenger and pound of air cargo in open business
competition.
JET-AGE EFFICIENCY
The fact that TAA gains the greater overall
share of the competitive passenger market is in-
dicative of TAA’s business efficiency.
The continued business success of TAA helps
to preserve the competition vital to a healthy
airline industry.
BENEFITS OF COMPETITION
This competition guarantees that every Austra-
lian will continue to enjoy the right to choose by
which airline he will fly, or consign air cargo.
Competition also helps maintain the highest
standards of service for Australian air travellers.
Supporters of free enterprise, in placing busi-
ness with TAA, are preserving for themselves
these benefits of business competition in the air-
line industry.
This is one reason why so many business-
men fly on our Whispering T-Jets. Another is that
they simply prefer to fly TAA.

EDUCATION
Our Unprofessional Teachers
THE overriding but elusive aim of all Australian teachers’ organisations and most
teachers is the achievement of professional status, yet recent developments make
this goal seem more distant than ever.
°
Their problem is that it cannot be
shown with certainty that any degree
of training necessarily alters a person’s
ability to teach. The standard procedure
for taking a class is easily learned, and
discipline depends mainly on the per-
sonality of the particular teacher. Con-
sequently, a teacher finds it difficult
to build around himself any more profes-
sional mystique than is possessed by a
sergeant-major.
The College of Education is itself a
token of this anxiety among teachers to
enhance their professional image. It was
formed in 1959 as a body which should
be able to obtain a standing equivalent
to that of professional institutions in
other fields, and its membership is
restricted to those of recognised achieve-
ment and qualifications. This recognition
is granted by those who are already
members. Its regular get-togethers have
produced documents for public debate,
but as yet it could not be said to have
either pioneered new fields or raised
general standards. However, its latest
report may yet succeed where the Martin
Report failed.
First official responses have not, how-
ever, proved encouraging. The Victorian
Director of Education, Mr. F. H. Brooks,
pointed out that the report showed that
Victoria’s problems were not unique. This
line of argument is about as relevant to
the situation as the frequent politicians’
claim that we are spending far more now
than we were so many years ago. Both
replies show the same complacency and
acceptance of the status quo which is pre-
venting education breaking out of its old
moulds to shape itself according to modern
problems.
The Australian College of Education,
meeting in Sydney last weekend (May
13-17), had before it a report which re-
vealed that an alarming proportion of
teachers have failed to achieve even the
educational level of their pupils. This
failure no doubt enables them to sympa-
thise with their students’ difficulties, and
for so long as they are confined to the
task of preparing candidates for examina-
tions which are set and corrected by others
it need not adversely affect their teaching.
It does, however, make it difficult for any
teachers to claim recognition from the
community for special skills.
The real significance of our employment
of untrained, unqualified, and uneducated
teachers has nothing to do with their cap-
acity or otherwise to take a lesson. This
policy may have the secondary consequence
of depriving children of contact with first-
class minds, although such people prob-
ably cannot be spared for full-time teach-
ing, anyway, and would best be used in
schools by bringing them in occasionally
as visiting experts.
The primary consequence has been to
freeze our whole concept of education in
the old framework of teacher, chalk, and
class, and the resulting pattern of examina-
tions, inspections, and centralisation. The
teacher is still seen merely as the conduit
through whom a preordained body of
knowledge is piped to a preselected class
who will regurgitate it in the prescribed
form on the proper examination paper.
Once we abandon the illusion that every-
thing will be right one day, we can see
various means for meeting the situation as
it actually is. All of these methods involve
the recognition of the qualified teacher, not
as a classroom technician but as someone
able to take the responsibility for organ-
ising a program of education to meet the
needs of a particular group of students.
In the carrying out of this program he will
both use such aids as teaching machines
and entrust parts of the operation to less
qualified assistants, but the prime respon-
sibility will be his alone.
JOHN McLAREN
ETV needs VHF
THE biggest disappointment in the Postmaster-General’s rejection of the Weeden
Report’s recommendations on educational television was not his refusal to appoint
an independent authority financed by the Commonwealth. It was Mr. A. Hulme’s
refusal to reserve the remaining very high frequency (VHF) band for educational tele-
vision purposes.
Equally disappointing are the curious
reasons given by the Government for its
decision. In last week’s long-delayed state-
ment on the report, which was first handed
to the Government 18 months ago, Mr.
Hulme said that the Government would
not allocate the one remaining VHF
channel in each large population centre
for educational purposes because
• As Australia develops there will be need
for extension of the existing types of
television services;
• and because the long-term demands for
educational television are such that they
are unlikely to be accommodated by the
provision of one additional channel.
Now the first reason almost certainly
means only one of two things. Either the
Government envisages a fourth commercial
channel in the large metropolitan centres
or it is planning to give the Australian
Broadcasting Commission a second net-
work.
Considering the difficulties both
Channel 10 in Sydney and Channel 0 in
Melbourne have had in their first years,
the large sums of money which have
already been lost by them, and the drop
in advertising revenue to the other channels
a fourth commercial channel seems to be
a long way off. Commercial television
executives estimate that Sydney or Mel-
bourne could not absorb a fourth channel
for at least another ten years.
But it is the second possibility which
seems much more likely—that is, a second
network for the ABC, something similar to
BBC-2, except that we would not have to
convert our sets to receive the new channel.
The ABC has made it quite clear that it
wants a second network and has brought
all the pressure it can muster on the Gov-
ernment to provide it.
Metropolitan universities have been the
most outspoken opponents to the idea of
ABC control over an ETV network. The
argument against the ABC is that its
whole thinking is determined by the need
to entertain rather than to educate and
that it would be too closely tied to Gov-
ernment thinking on education. The ABC
reply, and it seems that of the Govern-
ment, too, is that it would be a great
wastage if the ABC’s facilities and experi-
ence were not to be used. If the Govern-
ment is contemplating. reserving the VHF
channel for a second ABC network, now
would be the time to say so.
The second reason that the Govern-
ment gave was that one VHF channel
would not be enough. This is certainly true
because the instructional programs in an
ETV network (as distinct from the general
interest or adult education programs) need
many outlets. But it is curious to argue
that because ETV needs more than one
channel eventually it should not get at
least one channel with which to make a
start.
The encouraging features of Mr.
Hulme’s statement are the agreement to
support educational television develop-
ments in the ultra high frequency (UHF)
bands—that is those bands now being used
by taxi companies, etc., and also by a
small educational unit at the University
of New South Wales. Sets have to be
converted to receive programs transmitted
on the UHF band at a cost which is vari-
ously estimated from $25 to $5O.
The main reason an ETV network
should have at least one VHF outlet is
because conversion takes time and.it
would be years before a majority of sets
carry UHF provisions. The need for ETV
is very much now.
The Weeden Report is a useful docu-
ment but not a thoroughly convincing one.
A dullness of style will not help its mes-
sage about the need for educational tele-
vision to get through to very many. But
one thing the Government failed to do was
to release it as soon as it became available
so that it could be discussed widely, as
occurred with the Restrictive Trade Prac-
tices legislation. The question of educa-
tional television in Australia is no less
serious.

The Lost Years
Vietnam’s Place in Australian History
By GEOFFREY FAIRBAIRN
I T is becoming increasingly clear, though
it should have been obvious from the
outset, that the debate about Vietnam is
really a debate about Australia’s position
in the world and its likely future.
For a decade and a half the majority
of Australians have supported a Govern-
ment which, in effect, if not always
deliberately, assured them that they were
privileged to concentrate wholly upon
national development (much of it quite
unco-ordinated and milk bar-ish) on the
understanding that their “great and power-
ful friends” would hold the pass in South-
East Asia. Australian troops were sent
to Malaysia and specialists to Vietnam
but in an almost surreptitious manner.
The terrible events in the Near North were
at all costs to be kept peripheral to Aus-
tralian public life. * Australians were in-
vited by the Government to exert all their
energies and thoughts toward the building
of an affluent—and humanly careless —
society; they were persuaded, to the point
almost of human indecency, that they
were peculiarly privileged, physically in-
violate and altogether uninvolved in the
sufferings of the outside world.
Then came the sudden commital of a
battalion to Vietnam. Still the Govern-
ment tried to keep the affair peripheral:
the troops went off under cover of dark-
ness, so to speak; the teach-ins and other
protest activities were taken altogether
unseriously; no suggestion was frankly
made of further sacrifices to come; and
a certain very narrow section, politically
voiceless, seemingly unlikely to be or-
ganised opinion-wise in any fashion at
all, was selected for conscription. Other-
wise, flatulent normalcy was to be the
order of the day.
Now it is easy to be unfair to the
Government here, if one is not careful;
particularly easy for someone who only
three years ago was regarded by most
Liberal voters of his acquaintance as an
eccentric “Prophet of Doom” for draw-
ing attention to the slow escalation of
revolutionary war in Vietnam and as
frankly malevolent when he wrote a for-
ward to a booklet on Vietcong terrorists.
The Government has a very great national
responsibility to defeat a Left-wing con-
trolled Labor Party at this period in our
history; and so, having been for so long
the champion of heedless development at
home and inhumane parochialism vis-a-vis
its neighbors, it simply did not have the
right kind of social “terrain” to work
upon when the moment of truth came.
That it was itself partly responsible for
this is beside the point today, provided
the Government can learn quickly just
what is at issue.
It is not really at all —on the popular
level—a question of the rights and wrongs
of the Vietnamese agony; nor is it a ques-
tion of strategic choices soberly being
weighed in people’s minds. Most of the
people who say—and they are a very large
portion of the population-that they have
not been properly informed on the Viet-
namese question, do not seem to be wholly
honest in their protestation. Objectively,
they have not been well-informed by the
Government; but subjectively (probably
quite unawarely) they give the impres-
sion, many of them, of rather enjoying
the muddle, since it provides an excuse
for uncommitedness. This is obvious
enough. But the attitude has deep
roots in Australian society; it is part
of the Australian dream of having built
a New Jerusalem. What is really being
put at issue today is the long dream of
T . . . 7
isolationism, an isolationism not protected
by Australian power but by the great,
armadas of the U.S.A. and Gieat Britain.
And by a strange irony of the post-World
War II situation, the Liberal Party
assumed the role of protagonist of this
wish-dream, “protecting” it and “strength-
ening” it behind the facade of a crumbling
Commonwealth and a long since meaning-
less monarchy. The Queen, cosy, reassur-
ing, and for many people (in some eerie
way) redolent of the protected, isolated
innocence which has always been a signifi-
cant and lovely, though gormless, part of
the Australian dream.
Commitment in Vietnam appears to
threaten many of the central facets of
the Australian dream: its privileges, its
easygoingness, its very “luckiness”; even
its curious “innocence.” Which is why Dr.
Cairns is—and a time will continue
to be—immeasurably more effective a
propagandist than anyone the Govern-
ment can put up or than anyone who in
this instance feels impelled to support
Government policy in Vietnam. His
message, stripped of its meretricious argu-
mentation, is even more cosy than the
Christmas Day image of the Queen broad-
casting pleasing cliches from Balmoral. He
seems only to be inviting people to avoid
the “dirtiness” of Vietnam and thereby
be permitted to return to the old ways and
the old dream. The Government, on the
other hand, concerns itself with occasional
bouts of careful, intellectual argumen-
tation the validity of which has long
since been obscured by those exercises in
“sickling o’er the native resolution” with
“the pale cast of thought,” called teach-ins
and preach-ins and so on.
The new 32-page, free pamphlet brought
out by External Affairs (“Vietnam: Ques-
tions and Answers”), pompously bearing
the Imprimatur of the Minister for Ex-
ternal Affairs, is intellectually altogether

excellent. It answers the kind of questions
many people claim to be asking: Why are
our troops in Vietnam? Is it a civil war?
Are we in breach of the United Nations
or the Geneva Agreement? Are we
actively seeking a peaceful settlement?
And if so, on what terms? Twenty-five
questions are answered lucidly and in
the fashion of civilised discourse. Ex-
ternal Affairs are to be commended for
bringing it out. It will be useful to
speakers who have the rather rare luck
in these days to be addressing an audience
of people concerned to worry out the
rights and wrongs of the struggle. Most of
the meetings are, of course, political
operations designed either to steady the
morale of the Vietcong or to undermine
the resolution of the Government.
And this is what the Government does
not seem to have adequately understood
so far. What is in process is not at all
an intellectual debate about events in Viet-
nam but a profound emotional unheaval
in the minds of a great number of Aus-
tralians, an upheaval that is being very
skilfully used by the Left—in emotional
terms. The moving spirits of the protest
movement are, of course, often com-
munists or crypto-communists or Old
Lefties who have at last found a way of
vociferously crawling out of their funk-
holes (where they had been put by
Khrushchev’s revelations about their hero,
Stalin) or men blatantly using the suffer-
ings of Vietnam in their own careers.
But what matters to the Government
and those who support it on Vietnam
is not the faces of the nakedly ambitious
political Leftists or of their intellectual
allies—but the source of these men’s in-
fluence at present. The source of their
influence is not at all dissimilar from
the source of the appeasers’, influence
in England in the 19305; a disdain for
“lesser breeds without the Law,” a des-
perate concern to retain outworn privi-
leges, a greedy belief that terms can be
made with rampant totalitarian States, a
subjective inability—for ignoble reasons—
to accept the fact that the totalitarians
are not susceptible to horse-trading, and
a humanly impermissible and deeply
arrogant assumption that somehow pro-
vidence has conferred upon them (the
lucky Anglo-Saxons) a special role in his-
tory denied to “Wops” and “Dagoes.”
When this, in Australia, is linked with
an equally impermissible dream of
innocence, then the task of a Government
that has done nothing to discourage such
tendencies for more than a decade and a
half is onerous indeed. It will not be
fulfilled by trying to keep Vietnam peri-
pheral to Australian life. Perhaps it was
worth a try, in ordinary cynical political
terms. But it is now too late. It can
only be done by an appeal to those other
sources of the Australian tradition: a
human concern for the bullied, a sense
of solidarity with mates in danger, a
pride in fighting wicked and expansionist
powers, an awareness that what is being
fought is as dreadful and destructive of the
human spirit as was Nazism; and a
courageous understanding of the fact that
for the rest of its history Australia can-
not contract out of the agonies of its
near neighbors.


Clem Attlee Revisited
“What else can Australia do?”
By BARRY JONES
“TJE’S just a bit chesty, but otherwise
JLJ_all right,” said his inimitable Jeeves
when I rang Earl Attlee to confirm
our luncheon date. One had not, as they
say in New Yorker profiles, seen him for
several years. His handwriting had grown
shakier, and the sudden death of his wife,
Violet, in June, 1964, had been a terrible
blow, followed by a stroke. Newsreels of
the Churchill funeral, at which he had
been a pallbearer, left poignant memories
of his frailty and determination when,
hatless and leaning heavily on a stick,
looking slight enough for the wind to
blow him off his feet, Anthony Eden and
an officer of the Grenadier Guards had
to assist him down the steps of St. Pauls.
After Countess Attlee died he returned
to London and took up a substantial
third floor flat in King’s Bench Walk, on
the site of Sir Edward Coke’s old cham-
bers. Two hundred paces away he began
his career as a barrister in 1905 with rooms
in Paper Buildings. “Never earned more
than £2O in the best weeks. Still ... it
gave me time for reading. Mostly com-
mercial cases. Rather boring. I nearly
became a lawyer with the Ecclesiastical
Commissioners—that would have been
worse.
“In my youth I dreamed of becoming
a teacher of history. The Italian Renais-
sance was my special interest. But I was
too diffident. If I had known my future
I should have taken the trouble to learn
French properly. Twice during the war I
had to speak Latin at lunch as it was the
only common language between a foreign
P.M. in exile and myself. Winston spoke
an astounding brand of French just
Winstonese really—but he said it so loudly
and forcefully that he could always be
understood. George Lansbury had the
loudest voice I ever heard in politics—
then Hugh Dalton. I once heard Dalton’s
voice booming through the walls of his
office. ‘What’s Hugh doing?’ I asked.
‘Talking to America,’ they said. ‘Well,
tell him to use the telephone next time.’
“Have you any Labor men of the
William Warbey persuasion in Australia?”
he asked me. “A few,” I murmured in my
Ralph Richardson voice. “God help you
if you have —nobody else will. The Viet-
nam war is a wretched thing—but I don’t
see what else Australia can do except
back the U.S. The case is much the same
as with North and South Korea. Michael
Stewart’s speech in the Oxford Union
debate was masterly. I’m sorry now that
I did not promote him to Cabinet when I
was P.M.—but he did hold my old office,
as Under-Secretary for War.
“I have the impression that you are
rather isolationist in Australia —even in the
ALP. You don’t seem to take much interest
in New Guinea, do you? I never regarded
Sukarno’s empire very seriously. A Maori
ambassador to Indonesia would have been
a useful move if the New Zealanders had
the right man.” He had obviously fol-
lowed recent developments in the ALP
and wanted to know what I talked about
with Arthur Calwell, Gough Whitlam,
and Jim Cairns. There’s not much about
political in-fighting that he misses.
As I took him out to lunch and we
walked to the lift a well-preserved
octogenarian, sprightlier than C.R.A.,
stopped him by the door. “It’s the
first time I’ve envied your privileges as
an earl,” he said, “being able to put your
Christmas greetings in the ‘Court Circular’
in the ‘Times’ instead of sending out
cards.” “Yes, yes, yes,” said old Clem,
who is usually not so wasteful of words.
Then as his greeter turned away, Clem
said with bell-like clarity, “Poor old duck,
I can’t think who he is, but I know he’s
88.”
We tottered through King’s Bench Walk
Earl Attlee
to the Strand and I propped Lord Attlee
against an archway while I raced off,
looking for a cab. Several elderly people
came up to pay their respects while he
doffed his homburg, inclined slightly, and
muttered his thanks. Over lunch (wild
duck with apple), he talked about Hugh
Gaitskell. Would Gaitskell have won the
1964 Election? “Of course. And by a
much bigger margin than Wilson. His death
was tragic,- coming just after he reached a
position of unique personal authority in
public life.” For the first time his eyes
moistened. “I backed Wilson for the
leadership, you know. Brown would not
have appealed to such a broad section of
the public. Harold has turned out better
than anyone hoped.” Had he noticed the
Churchillian cadences and stance in the
P.M.’s television appearances? “Oh, yes.
Everyone has.”
Back at his flat I remembered that his
deadliest judgment of any man was, “He
talks too much”—so I said comparatively
little. There were many long silences
and I restrained myself from supplying
words when he found difficulty articulat-
ing.
I mentioned my forthcoming research in
Vienna on Joseph ll—and he shook his
head at the folly of trying to account for
the strange ways of intellectuals in politics.
He showed me over his library—l9th-
century novels, poetry, modern biographies,
and war histories. (“He spends most of
his day reading,” his manservant whis-
pered.) I was interested in the auto-
graphed editions, especially the Churchill
memoirs. General Eisenhower had
inscribed his “Crusade in Europe” to “The
Prime Minister of England and Mrs.
Attlee, 1949, with warm regards.” He
reproved me for having written about
Philip Noel-Baker in my book as if he
had been a leading figure in the 1945-51
Government. “Why did you leave out
Chuter Ede, Tom Williams, Manny Shin-
well, and Chris Addison? They were far
more important.
“Whatever induced Menzies to take on
the post of Lord Warden?” he asked. “I
would not have thought the post was very
attractive. It’s not as if Walmer Castle
is such a prize. I think most of it is
19th-century restoration. I only found one
interesting thing in it. I was looking for
the smallest room in the place, and in
it I saw a blue plaque on the wall which
read ‘Nelson met Wellington here’.”
Who was the greatest man he had
ever known? Churchill? Mao? Stalin?
Roosevelt?
“Tito, I think. Churchill had great
advantages, a famous man, the aristocratic
connexion, the encouragement of power-
ful friends such as Lloyd George. He had
to overcome great hostility from his own
party, of course, but he had been thought
of as a leader in time of war for twenty-
five years before 1940. His energy was
extraordinary. I think only Napoleon,
Bismarck, and Lloyd George could com-
pare with him for energy. Of course
his judgment was often at fault and he
needed down-to-earth people behind him
to say, ‘Now, Winston, think again.’ But
without the war he would not have had
his great chance. His peacetime ministry
was rather dismal. Lloyd George had
greater gifts as an administrator but
I think Winston was the bigger man. Nye
Bevan always argued that L-G was the
biggest figure in recent public life.
“Mao’s greatness did not stand out when
we met in Peking in 1954. The other
members of the leadership group deferred
to him of course but he did not give
the impression of pre-eminence. He made
no attempt to impress our delegation with

his grasp of affairs and played the role
of the jolly peasant. He told peasant
stories and laughed and smiled constantly.
‘Good old Uncle Mao!’ That was the im-
pression that he gave. Perhaps it was
the only one he cared to give.
“I didn’t mind meeting Mao despite
his history of blood but I always hated
meeting Stalin. I had an unconquerable
aversion to him. Ernie Bevin always
used to say that when he shook hands with
Stalin he expected to find blood on his
own palm. He had the coldest eye. He
smiled but with reserve at Pots-
dam. He had good reason. He would
have been a great poker player.
“Roosevelt was vain, a brilliant con-
versationalist, but I could never find out
how much depth there was in him. Next
to Winston he lacked intensity. But he
was a wonderful manager of men
except with Stalin, who managed him —-
and had an almost intuitive grasp of
strategy. He was a superb set-piece orator,
but a poor writer, oddly enough,

educated. Brilliant organiser. Survival

Great war leader. And he defeated Stalin
i n 1948 when Stalin was at his height,
No one has contributed more to thawing
the Cold War. I know him well and
have often stayed with him.” Yes, I pro-
tested, but what of his treatment of
Djilas? Lord Attlee dismissed it as a
comparatively minor blemish on Tito’s
portrait. “Tito knows that it is possible
for a critic to dislodge an apparently
impregnable figure. He has done it him-
self, and wants to make sure that no
one can do it to him.”
What did he think of A. J. P. Taylor’s
charge in his recent bestseller “English
History 1914-45” that in 1940 Attlee had
urged Halifax’s claims as P.M. over Chur-
chill? “‘Ridiculous. Halifax was such an
arch-Municheer that he would never have
been acceptable. Most of the Party did
not care over much but I always had a
high regard for Winston’s grasp of war.
As you know, I not only served at Gal-
lipoli, but I supported his whole strategic
concept.”
I had driven past Churchill’s deserted
tomb earlier in the week and I raised
the problem of the “Great Churchill
Mystery” a subject worthy of close
analysis. Why did Australia raise well
over $4,000,000 for the Winston Chur-
chill Memorial Trust in a single week-
end, over-subscribing its quota by 120%,
while in Britain, despite a six-month
campaign, only £700,000 was paid (14%
of the quota a disparity of 16:1)?
“Part of the reason might be that your
population is concentrated in a very few
centres ours is more evenly spread and
local committees in, say, Oxford were
not able to use the high-pressure tactics of
the Australian campaign. But the figures
are extraordinary. I suppose that we are
ironical and detached about heroes in Eng-
land and there are painful and nostal-
gic memories associated with his great
days. Winston’s death was so obviously
the end of an era more would have
been raised while he was still alive. But
can you account for Australia’s over-
subscription?”
This was the signal for my big speech.
“I think it was in the nature of ‘severance
pay’ a tangible acknowledgement of
the unique British contribution to our life,
but also a gesture of farewell, a recognition
that Britain’s destiny lies increasingly with
Europe and ours with the Pacific. The
impact of the funeral was to bring to
a single point these feelings. Paradoxically
the Kennedy appeal was not a success
because our U.S. links are strengthening
and deepening and there is no parental
obligation to pay off.”
“Yes,” he said, “it seems the only
plausible reason. After all Australia had
no direct cause to be grateful to Churchill.
He took no interest with the Pacific War,
and scrapped with your ministers. He
was not really a Commonwealth man, you
know. His interests were very much
centred on England and Europe. I doubt
if his interests extended as far as Scot-
land.”
Before I left I produced my camera
and he asked his manservant to photo-
graph us together. He asked if I had
seen his former private secretary Joe
Burke, now Professor of Fine Arts at
Melbourne University. “He is a first-
class man. Give him my love.” He gave
me two photographs, one for Professor
Burke. His pen dried up as he autographed
my print. He put the nib on his tongue
three or four times before it would write.
“Use my pen,” I suggested. “No,” he said,
“it doesn’t matter how it looks, but lick-
ing it always gets the pen to work.”
What is there about England that makes
me choke up? Or am I only becoming
middle aged?


Is There a God?
By MALCOLM MUGGERIDGE
WELL, is there? I myself should be
very happy to answer with an
emphatic negative. Temperamen-
tally, it would suit me well to settle for
what this world offers, and to write off
as wishful thinking, or just the self-
importance of the human species, any
notion of a divine purpose and a divinity
to entertain and execute it. The earth’s
sounds and smells and colors are very
sweet; human love brings golden hours;
the mind at work earns delight. I have
never wanted a God, or feared a God,
or felt under any necessity to invent one.
Unfortunately, I am driven to the con-
clusion that God wants me.
God comes padding after me like a
Hound of Heaven. His shadow falls over
all my little picnics in the sunshine, chill-
ing the air; draining the viands of their
flavor, talk of its sparkle, desire of its
zest. Under God’s eye, tiny hoarded glories
-—a little fame, some money . . . Oh!
Mr. M., how wonderful you are! fall
into dust. One shivers as the divine beast
of prey gets ready for the final spring;
as the shadow lengthens, reducing to in-
finite triviality all mortal hopes and
desires.
There is no escape. Even so, one
twists and turns. Perhaps Nietzsche was
right when he said that God had died.
Progressive theologians with German names
seem to think so; Mr. Henry Luce turned
over one of his precious covers to the
notion. If God were dead, and eternity
had stopped, what a blessed relief to one
and all! Then we could set about making
a happy world in our own way happy
in the woods like Mellors and Lady C;
happiness successfully pursued, along with
life and liberty, in accordance with the
Philadelphia specification; happy the Wil-
son way, with only one book to take to
the post-office one book one happiness;
happy in the prospect of that great Red
Apocalypse, when the state was withered
away, and the proletariat reign for ever-
more.
Alas, dead or alive. He is still God,
and eternity ticks on even though all the
clocks have stopped. I agree with Kierke-
gaard that “what man naturally loves is
finitude,” and that involvement through
God in infinitude “kills in him, in the
most painful way, everything in which he
really finds his life . . . shows him his own
wretchedness, keeps him in sleepless un-
rest, whereas finitude lulls him into en-
joyment.” Man, in other words, needs
protection against God, as tenants do
against Rachmanism, or minors against
hard liquor.
Where is such protection to be found?
One of the most effective defensive sys-
tems against God’s incursions has hitherto
been organised religion. The various
churches have provided a refuge for fugi-
tives from God His voice drowned in
the chanting, His smell lost in the incense,
His purposes obscured and confused in
creeds, dogmas, dissertations, and other
priestly pronunciamentos. In vast cathe-
drals, as in little conventicles, or just
wrapped in Quaker silence, one could get
away from God. Plainsong held Him at
bay, as did revivalist eloquence, hearty
hymns, and intoned prayers. Confronted
with that chanting, moaning, gurgling
voice—“ Dearly beloved brethren, I pray
and beseech you . . .” or with that earnest,
open, Oxfam face, shining like the morn-
ing sun with all the glories flesh is heir to,
God could be relied on to make off.
Unfortunately, this defensive system has
now proved to be a Maginot Line, easily
bypassed by hordes of happiness-pursuers,
some in clerical collars and even mitres,
joyously bearing a cornucopia of affluence,
and scattering along their way birth pills,
purple hearts, and other goodies a
mighty throng whose trampling feet clear
a path as wide as a motorway, along which
God can come storming in.
Another defence against God has been
utopianism, and the revolutionary fervor
that goes therewith. A passion to change
the world and make it nearer to the heart’s
desire automatically excludes God, who
represents the principle of changelessness,
and confronts each heart’s desire with its
own nullity. It was confidently believed
that a Kingdom of Heaven on Earth could
be established, with “God, Keep Out!”
notices prominently displayed at the off-
limits. In practice, the various versions of
this Kingdom have one and all proved a
failure; utopian hopes washed away in the
blood of Stalin’s purges, reduced to the
dimensions of Mr. Wilson’s one book,
liberated out of existence.
Few any longer believe in the coming
to pass of a perfect, or even a Great,
society. There never was a less revolu-
tionary climate than now prevails, when
almost any status quo, however ram-
shackle, can stand Tito’s, Franco’s,
Ulbricht’s. Why, tourism today is a- more
dynamic force than revolution, swaying,
as it does, crowns and thrones; Thomas
Cook and the American Express, not the
Internationale, unite the human race. In
Africa, it is true, regimes still totter and
fall, but even there the wind of change
blows as it listeth. Even when the great
day comes, and Dr. Verwoerd and his
friends are dispossessed and replaced by a
Black Redeemer and his friends, it will
be history, not progress, that has spoken;.
With the church no longer a sanctuary,
and utopianism extinguished, the fugitive
from God has nowhere to turn. Even if,
as a last resort, he falls back on stupefying
his senses with alcohol or drugs or sex,
the relief is but short-lived. Either he
will sink without trace for ever into that
slough, or, emerging, have to face the
inescapable confrontation. It is a fearful
thing to fall into the hands of the living
God thus Kierkegaard (and also
Cromwell) groaned in desperation.
What living God? A being with whom
one has a relationship, on the one hand,
inconceivably more personal than the most
intimate human one, to the point that,
as we are told, God has actually counted
the hairs of each head; on the other, so
remote that in order to establish a valid
relationship at all, it is necessary to die,
to murder one’s own flesh with the utmost
ferocity, and batter down one’s ego as
one might a deadly snake, a cobra which
has lifted its hooded head with darting
forked tongue to sting. (I say “a being,”
which suggests a person, a spirit, a genie
coming out of a bottle, and so is utterly
inappropriate. There are no adequate
words for any of the great absolutes, like
life and death, good and evil; only for
trivialities like politics and economics and
physics. One falls back on the meaning-
less monosyllable God, as Hindu sadhus
in their spiritual exercises endlessly repeat
the equally meaningless monosyllable
Oom.)
What can be said with certainty is that,
once the confrontation has been ex-
perienced the rocky summit climbed,
the interminable desert crossed an un-
imaginably delectable vista presents itself,
so vast, so luminous, so enchanting, that
the small ecstasies of human love, and the
small satisfactions of human achievement,
by comparison pale into insignificance. Out
of tactical despair comes an overwhelm-
ing strategic happiness, enfolded in which
one is made aware that every aspect of
the universe, from a tiny grain of sand
to the light-years which measure its im-
measurable dimensions, from the minutest
single living cell to the most complex
human organism, are intimately related,
all deserving of reverence and respect; all
shining, like glow-worms, with an intrinsic
light, and, at the same time, caught in
an all-encompassing radiance, like dust in
a sunbeam.
This sense of oneness, with the conse-
quent release from the burden of the self,
I take to be God something which
indubitably exists; which not only has not
died, but cannot die. Such has been the
testimony of those in the past whom I
most revere —like Christ, St. Paul, Pascal,
Bunyan, Blake and Dostoevsky. To
their testimony, with the greatest possible
diffidence, I add my own, so hesitant, fit-
ful, and inarticulate.


ONE MORE
WEEK
The Ordeal of Ove Arup
THE most tragic figure in the Opera
House affair is not Mr. Utzon, who is
believed to be preparing a book on the
Opera House that will show how it would
have looked had he finished it, but Mr.
Ove Arup, the 71-year-old senior partner
of the world-renowned structural engineer-
ing company that had worked so closely
with Mr. Utzon on stages one and two.
Their relationship had been very close;
Arup’s admiration for Utzon is still
very high despite the shock of hearing
(and reading) in Sydney earlier this
month some of the accusations Utzon has
made about him.
When he left Sydney last week, Mr.
Arup flew to Honolulu where Utzon
went on his departure. Arup, like Utzon,
went there to talk to a Danish mutual
friend, Professor Steen Rasmussen, a
world figure in architecture. Rasmussen
has written to Arup telling him to resign.
Arup went there to tell Rasmussen the
facts of the case and to try to get Ras-
mussen to talk Utzon into coming back ■
as design architect. Arup himself does
not hold out much hope of success, but
he says he must try. “You know Utzon
would not see me here; he left a couple
of days after I arrived and would not
see me. I wrote to him several times
but got no answer. He didn’t see any
of the other consultants either. He just
left me a letter saying that I should take
action to get him back in charge.”
Arup’s decision to remain with the pro-
ject has meant that friends and associates
around the world have bitterly attacked
him. “It is personal disaster for me. I
came here with the idea of getting him
back in some way, but not in sole charge.
It is a folly to expect that all that has
to happen is for Utzon to come back in
charge and everything would be all right.
“It would be much easier for me if I
resigned. But I cannot do it if I don’t
think Utzon was wronged. Why should I
resign to force Utzon’s return on his
terms if I think that would be wrong?
It is the Opera House that is important,
not people.
“I talked with the extreme Utzonites.
Some of them are mad, others misinformed.
I tell them facts and they won’t believe
them. If Utzon says something, it is
holy writ, and they call me a liar.”
This week Mr. Joern Utzon’s Pandora’s
box will probably be opened, and the
new architectural team at the Opera
House will really know what their prob-
lems are. So far the new team designer
Mr. Peter Hall, supervisor Mr. Lionel
Todd, and manager of contract documents
Mr. D. S. Littlemore have not yet
been able to see the drawings Mr. Utzon
left behind him when he hurriedly left
Sydney at the end of last month.
Until the question of his fees is
settled (and that could be this week) the
drawings remain with Mr. Utzon’s solici-
tors. But the architects who have been
entrusted with picking up the threads of
Mr. Utzon’s grand design are not put-
ting too much hope on the drawings solv-
ing the many major problems they face.
The biggest problem is installing the
glass walls, and there seems no chance
that Pandora’s box will solve that one.
But there are plenty of other problems.
The ceiling (one of the issues over which
Mr. Utzon appeared to resign), the house
lighting, and the seating in the auditorium
(there could be a real fuss over this) are
far from determined, although Mr. Hall
feels confident he can continue with Mr.
Utzon’s cladding ideas.
At least one problem has been settled:
the consultants have agreed that the
Utzon plan for the ceiling, which Arup
so strongly opposed, was quite impractical
and acoustically bad.
Even if Mr. Utzon’s box holds no
answers at all, the new architectural team
have at least been fortified by the
solidarity of the overseas specialist con-
sultants to the project, all of whom
decided to re-Uegotiate their contracts with
the N.S.W. Government despite Mr.
Utzon’s claims that they would only work
with him.
Mr. Utzon badly misjudged their
reaction to his resignation, just as he
misjudged the State Government’s. And
the facts that emerged when the consul-
tants got together for the first time ever
in Sydney this month were such that the
case against Mr. Utzon mounted sub-
stantially. This may explain why he did
not wait to see them.
Up in Michigan
LAST WEEK a 45 r.p.m. record by Mrs.
Miller, the elderly Kalamazoo (Michigan)
housewife who cannot sing and whose
records have sold millions, was released
in Australia. On it she sings “Lovers’ Con-
certo” and “Downtown.” We asked
Paling’s record shop, Sydney, how it was
going. “Very, very well. Those of us who
are of the musical fraternity are surprised.
Her diction is excellent. Her phrasing is
quite good. And she was played on the
ABC. That’s good enough for me. Poor
old soul, she has talent.”
Mrs. Miller’s comment is: “The good
Lord has been very good to me. We have
had and still have dreadful medical bills
for my husband. But now we don’t have
to worry. I’ve signed a seven-year con-
tract with Capitol.”
Heartbreak House
THE recent fire at Australian Programme
Services, Chippendale, Sydney, may have
been just another disaster to many readers
of the Press, but the disappearance into a
holocaust of scores of films starring Clark
Gable, Cary Grant, Bette Davis, Joan
Crawford, and other greats of the past was
heartbreaking for the high-powered film-
fan clubs in Sydney. “I nearly burst into
tears,” said one member of the Jeanette
MacDonald Fan Club, employed at APS,
as she saw what happened when the roof
caved in on a pile of Paramount prints
in which Jeanette made her initial appear-
ances. (At a recent screening by the fan
club of Miss MacDonald’s “The Fire-Fly,”
with Nelson Eddy, a comparatively minor
disaster took place when the print, appro-
priately, in view of its title, burst into
flames in the projector).
Another fan club, slightly farther “out,”
is the Max Steiner Club, which collects
the taped scores of the veteran Hollywood
composer, who has written the music for
hundreds of features from “King Kong”
to Bette Davis’ two-handkerchief epic,
“Now Voyager.” The Max Steiner people
were no less aggravated by the fire. Mr.
Steiner’s films had been withdrawn from
city stations, as the rights had expired, but
they could still be received by enthusiasts
who moved house to specific suburbs to
receive them on country stations.
They can see them no more: all went
up in flames or down in water, as so many
of the heroines accompanied by Mr.
Steiner’s mellifluous strains had done in
Hollywood’s past.

Friends and Relatives
ACCORDING to the latest edition of
Taxpayers’ Bulletin, tax informers are
doing well in the United States. Appar-
ently every year the Internal Revenue Ser-
vice Offices get 100,000 tips from good
citizens who believe their friends, relatives,
and neighbors are cheating on tax. The
informers are usually angry girlfriends,
jealous neighbors, sacked employees, or
business rivals. Rewards are paid only on
results and range from 1 percent to 10 per-
cent of evaded taxes collected. Recently
one girl secretary reported her former
boss and was paid $A33,450 reward. There
are even more perks in being a secretary
than one would think.
World-Wide
WE LEARN that Williamson-Powell, pro-
ducers of “They’re a Weird Mob,” are
now conducting a “world-wide search” for
an actor to portray “Bony,” the half-
aboriginal sleuth of Arthur Upfield’s
detective stories, which have vast inter-
national appeal (second only to Edgar
Wallace in Germany, for example) and
which Michael Powell proposes to film.
One wonders who might be chosen for
the half-aboriginal role: Sidney Poitier,
perhaps, or Sir Laurence in a return
to his “Othello” blackface routine?
Foreign Currency
CONCERN for the infiltration of Ameri-
can capital is one thing, but the driving
out of those few words which Australia
can call her own by a foreign currency
should not be neglected. There was a
time when cattle stealers were called
“duffers,” but the word seems to have
gone forever. The mass media coverage
of the big police raid on sheep and cattle
trucks in Victoria last week universally
referred to the stealers as “rustlers.” “CIB
Swoops on Rustlers’ Routes” screamed the
headlines, and another part of Australiana
bit the dust.

AROUND MELBOURNE
The Dancing Girls of Little Lon
THE Kathleen Gorham Dancing
Academy at 113 Little Lonsdale
Street is just over a week old.
Indeed as yet it doesn’t even rate a
sign. One opens a door and walks up
the stairs of an antique Little Lon
building.
Twenty years ago the Little Lon
had a very special reputation and the
thought of a dancing academy for
young ladies in the district would have
raised an oily chuckle. Now, of course,
the large, green, antiseptic Common-
wealth offices are just yonder and Little
Lon is inhabited, as Mr. Humphries
might say, by a very nice type of white-
collar worker.
The dancing academy is a converted
discotheque and the white brick walls
are decorated with some rather marvel-
lous “Alice In Wonderland” theme
murals which look rather more WEP
than Charles Blackman. Kathy Gorham
was there in tweedy slacks, woolly
sweater, cigarette in one hand, giving
French commands to an adult class of
professional dancers.
Already she has over 100 pupils, and
her teaching can go from 9 a.m. until
after 6 p.m. Then some nights she has
to continue on to GTV9, where she re-
mains under contract. During the day
she gets the professional dancers, after
4 p.m. the schoolchildren, at 6 p.m. the
business girls. Then on Saturday morn-
ings the academy is teeming with ten-
bob-a-lesson children. Ballet is very
much “in” just now.
She still wears her hair pulled back
into a pony tail for efficiency of move-
ment. Her eyes, large, clear, and
brown, are her best feature. Her last
performance with the Australian Ballet
was in “Giselle” at Her Majesty’s on
Wednesday, May 18. I saw her some
days beforehand. Already she had
announced the reasons for her retire-
ment. She wanted the regular life in
the one spot so that she could devote
more time to her seven-year-old son,
Tony.
“I’m glad ‘Giselle’ is the last one,”
she said. “It’s my favorite ballet. But
I don’t want any nonsense on Wednes-
day night. I’d like everything to happen
just normally. I must see Miss Van
Praag and ask her that there be no
speech.
“I am always one who believes in
calling a spade a spade and I am not
sure that they are particularly sorry
I’m going.” We discussed her 20-year
career and it seemed that perhaps the
highlight was when she was touring
as principal ballerina with the Marquis
de Cuevas Ballet company and one re-
membered headlines “Our Kathleen is
the Rage of Paris.”
“This was a tremendously exciting
period for me. Everything was going
so perfectly. I was touring all over
Europe and dancing with Serge Golo-
vine, who was the best male dancer in
the world at the time.”
But then she came back to Australia
to dance with The Borovansky Ballet,
a major turning point in her career.
Did she have any regrets about this
now?
“Regrets?” she said. “I don’t believe
in looking back and thinking of what
might have been. When Boro first
cabled I said ‘No’ and Serge Golovine
pleaded and pleaded with me not to
go back. But then Boro cabled that
he needed me. It was very big of him
to put it this way, and it is terribly
flattering as an artist to know that you
are needed, wanted. I don’t think any-
one ever really is, but it’s nice when it
happens that way. So I returned to
Australia out of loyalty. But looking at
it professionally, as a dancer, I suppose
it was a mistake to go back.
“But then I was looked after with the
Borovansky Ballet. Do you know that
in 1954 I was earning more than I was
Kathy Gorham
until late last year with the Australian
Ballet?”
Kathy Gorham was extremely direct
and brisk in her manner. One suspected
that she would make a very good
teacher. She answered everything she
was asked.
“No, I don’t want my son to go into
theatre. I don’t care what he does as
long as it is a normal life with . . . well
. . . I’d like him to go to the University.
But theatre is too hard. You have to
give it complete dedication. There’s no
time for living and doing the things
you want to do.
“Yes, it’s true the boys and girls in
the ballet are better off now than
they’ve ever been. When I think what
we put up with! They’re on a regular
living wage now all the year round and,
do you know, they get four weeks’ holi-
day a year? I had times when there
was no regular work for a year. In
1949 there was almost a two-year break.
Next year the Australian Ballet is off
to Manila and Canada. Actually, I’m
getting out at a time just when I could
reap everything.”
There was talk of people she admired
most in ballet, and Robert Helpmann
was mentioned immediately. “For me
he is absolutely marvellous. From the
beginning he seemed to understand my
temperament. No matter what role he
asked me to do, no matter how small,
I’d dance it for him. He’s such a sensi-
tive, intelligent, yet simple man.”
Nureyev? “At first I didn’t get on
with him at all. I had heard such
dreadful tales. Well, he gave a party
at his villa in Monte Carlo. I wasn’t
going. It seemed far too hypocritical
for me to accept. Our administrator,
Geoff Ingram, told me it was my duty
to go. It all proved to me that I hadn’t
taken the trouble to get to know the
man.
“During the evening he came over,
sat down beside me and talked for
about an hour and a half. He went
over his childhood, told me his life his-
tory, everything. I left exhilarated. Like
most great artists, he is very generous.
If he sees you at work he’ll take time
to correct any mistakes you are mak-
ing.”
Margot Fonteyn? “She’s incredible.
On this tour she was dancing better
than any time I have seen her in the
last ten years. Her age? I wouldn’t like
to say. Would she be 50? If you can
keep yourself fit the time you can go on
seems to be limitless. Ulanova was at
least 56 or 57.”

LONDON LETTER
That Top People Stigma
FROM ALEXANDER FRATER
ON Tuesday, May 3, the majority of
thinking Englishmen rose from their
beds with strong forebodings of
doom. This was Budget Day, aye. But
worse still, it was also the date on which
“The Times” was to start publishing news
on its front page. Thousands of tradi-
tionalists gazed miserably into, their shav-
ing mirrors and, while waiting tensely for
the thud of the morning paper on the
mat, wondered what the mighty Thunderer
of Printing House Square had done to tart
itself up. For days previously, Fleet
Street and the City had reverberated with
rumors of gossip columns, girlie pictures,
horoscopes, win-a-car competitions, hot
headlines (Stripper Susie Claims: I Am a
Man), and even, wonder of wonders,
writers’ bylines.
Well, they needn’t have worried. Dis-
patched (to the inside pages) were the
agony column and the discreet advertise-
ments for Rolls-Royces and Greek honey
and luxury cruises to the Windward
Islands. Dispatched, too (into limbo), was
the old almost-royal coat-of-arms mast-
head. But the prose was still gracious and
stately, the features still anonymous, the
news still reported as crisply and impar-
tially as ever. The front page, with its
larger body type and cleaner layout,
looked like a cross between the “Daily
Telegraph” and the “Guardian” “The
Times’ ” two main rivals. It carried a
photograph of Mr. Callaghan, the Chan-
cellor of the Exchequer, sitting in his
office looking as suicidally pessimistic as
ever, and a lead story on the fact that
London wgs to be the new location of
the NATO H.Q. There was only one
advertisement, inserted by Shell, mourn-
ing the passing of the old order. It con-
cluded:
Personalia from this page, we
solemnly expel
(And for moving with the times
There’s nothing quite like Shell).
The dreaded gossip column, christened
“As It Happens,” turned out to be posi-
tively anti-social in comparison with the
sort of feature that trades in pregnant
debs and horsy dukes. It kicked off
with: “Let us praise young Englishmen.
A group of them has just proved that
the Tower of Pisa is rotating at a rate
of about four seconds of arc a year, while
the angle of tilt is going up by about five
seconds. Mr. Norman Pratt, leader of
the team, reports reassuringly ‘there is
no danger of the tower falling down’.”
The column also handed out some fruity
exposes on the Dartmoor Livestock Pro-
tection Society, a charity sale at Sotheby’s,
a portable caesium magnetometer, a new
book on Shaw’s political attitudes, and a
revolutionary traffic plan for the Winter
hall area.
The decision to change the format was
taken 12 months ago by a four-man com-
mittee led by the editor, Sir William
Haley. Their object was simple and
direct: to increase sales. For some time
there had been concern among Timesmen
about static circulation. Paradoxically,
part of the trouble lay with the most
famous advertising campaign in the
paper’s history—the slogan, plastered on
hoardings and billboards all over Britain,
which claimed that “Top People Read The
Times.” The trouble was, it worked too
well. With the peculiar instinctive honesty
which characterises the Englishman in
matters of class and status, people who
were not top people decided that taking
“The Times” would seem pretentious, that
it would make the neighbors think they
had ideas above their station. So they
stayed with their current newspaper, and
“The Times” was left with much the
same circulation it had had before.
Thus, they’ve been trying to shake off
that “top people” stigma ever since. (Their
current slogan: “If you want to know,
it’s all in ‘The Times’.”) To Haley and
his committee it seemed that a change to
the orthodox newspaper format might be
the best way. So they hired a two-man
design consultancy named Blackburn and
Gardner to dream up a new front page.
What they dreamt up was, in the words,
of the “Sunday Times,” “possibly the most
startling front-page design ever considered
by a British newspaper. It was to have
three broad columns instead of the paper’s
usual seven, and nothing but summarised
news, cross-referenced to inside news
pages.” Haley liked the idea, but thought
it impracticable, so he appointed his own
editorial design team and set it to work.
And work it did—4.3o a.m. till day-
break virtually every night of the winter
—in a tight, secret, cloak-and-dagger at-
mosphere. I am not suggesting that sub-
editors with burp guns and tracker dogs
were posted at the make-up room door,
but the trial proof pages were religiously
locked away in the editor’s safe each
morning, and were only seen by a tiny
handful of top (whoops), um, senior
executives. The paper also shattered
tradition by signing on a cartoonist, a
talented young Belfast Irishman named
Kenneth Mahood who draws for “Punch”
and the “New Yorker,” and that was kept
pretty secret, too. Not even his friends
knew about the appointment till his
maiden cartoon appeared.
One aspect of the paper, however,
which has remained unchanged is the
matter of bylines —the right of a writer
to sign his name to his work. This tradi-
tion has not altered since the paper first
saw the light of day 181 years ago and,
if Sir William had any thoughts about
breaking it, they would have been swiftly
dispelled by remembering the words of
the great 19th-century editor Thomas
Barnes.
“Anonymous writing,” he barked, “is a
gain to the public, which thus obtains a
full and free discussion without any mix-

ture of that egotism and self-intrusion
which are inseparable from the composi-
tions of any individual writer in his own
personal character.”
'J’HE sharpest thorn in the flesh of British
television at the moment is a move-
ment called the “Clean Up TV Cam-
paign.” It is led by a woman named Mrs.
Mary Whitehouse, who seems to think
that most of the stuff beamed for public
consumption is lewd, beastly, porno-
graphic, racist, and sex-ridden. She be-
haves toward poor- old Auntie BBC as
though it were staffed by a pack of Jew-
baiting rapists. I, for one, resent having
my viewing habits censored by a portly,
middle-aged housewife, but people every-
where are flocking to her side as though
she carried some sort of Holy Grail tucked
in her stocking top.
They have meetings and they issue state-
ments and they exert influence; they even
have a secret weapon the telephone.
Whenever anything suggestive appears on
the screen, hundreds of thousands of
viewers, spurred on by the example of
Mrs. Whitehouse, leap for their blowers,
dial the BBC with trembling fingers, and
scream abuse at some startled switchboard
operator. This procedure has become
such an accepted, integrated facet of the
British Way of Life that a lady social
anthropologist, backed by the Centre of
Contemporary Cultural Studies in Birm-
ingham and financed by the Gulbenkian
Foundation, is going to spend 12 months
trying to find out why they do it.
She’ll need to move fast. The protectors
are breaking fresh ground now by kicking
U p a sd nk about a program which has
' no t even been shown. It’s a “study in
depth” of the young Spanish bullfighter
E 1 Cordobes, and the director, a man
named Kevin Billington with some splen-
did documentaries to his credit, has
apparently included shots of the bull being,
well> killed. Done in The proS pect of

fierce public opposition that the BBC has

ploratory discussions went on, informally,
and a t an undisclosed venue. Walking in
Regent’s Park one morning I saw six

WINES TO BUY
Those Private Bins
By CELLARMASTER
I AM continually badgered by a thick-
skinned, bird-brained species that,
terrier-like, snaps and growls whilst
fishing for information in a snaky \Vay.
It’s enough to make you mix your meta-
phors. The persistent cry of this strange
creature is a long howl of rage culminating
in the cry, “Why can’t I buy the top show
wines?” and softening only when it is fed
a few. Its look then changes to one of
patronising complacency and it can be
heard to say: “Well, you have to be in
the know. You see I’m connected with
the family . . . the under-manager of the
cellar is my aunt!”
Of course, they only want these
wines after show successes there
are many wines around that go on
to win awards and are freely avail-
able up to that time. One of the
purposes of this column is to help
find them for you, and I think I
can say, gentlemen, that we have
had notable success in this regard.
But the treasure trove goes on. I have
reviewed before, the question of the avail-
ability of gold bemedalled show wines (B.
December 18, 1965) and proved, obviously
quite inconclusively, that there were and
are many around, even after award pre-
sentation. Yet the cries persist. I reiterate,
and am met with the pronouncement, “Yes
we know all about that, but what about
the champion wines, the ones that win the
cups for the best red and the best white.
I can’t buy those. What are the wine
companies doing about it?”
So I went to find out. And since Pen-
folds have won so many championship
awards in the past few years, for two par-
ticular styles of wine, they seemed obvious
people to ask.
The two wines in question are their
Grange Hermitage, made at Magill in
South Australia, and Minchinbury Tra-
meah, made at Rooty Hill, just outside
Sydney. Both of these I have reviewed
before.
You could paper walls with the awards
these two styles have won.
Yet these wines are still hard to buy.
Jeff Penfold Hyland, Chief Executive of
the company says: “People must un-
derstand that it just isn’t as easy as
all that. Your winemakers and pro-
duction men get together to produce
a particular style. The initial
quantities may be quite small and
even these take years to develop.
If the wine is successful you may
decide to show it. There may be insuffi-
cient for this purpose so you plant more
vineyards or look for more material else-
where. All this takes time, a lot of it. Then
perhaps the wine wins top show awards.
Nothing would please us more than to
have unlimited supplies at this point. You
just have to wait. We are planting more of
these top wine grapes every year in areas
that we think will produce the required
result. I doubt if we will ever match the
demand though; the better you do,
naturally, the more people want your wine.
The., whole thing just snowballs.”
What was the story behind the develop-
ment of the Grange Hermitage? Max
Schubert, production manager for Pen-
folds and manager in South Australia, re-
plied: “Grange Hermitage is a combina-
tion of two things, top-grade material
matured in new small French oak. Both
Mr. Penfold Hyland and myself examined
the maturation of French wines, particu-
larly those in Bordeaux, in 1949 and ’5O.
We imported some oak and got down to
work. .We made wines that were de-
signed to improve for a minimum of 20

TO BRING YOU THIS STORY
CASE HISTORY 1
In 1951, that’s 15 years ago, a set of
six Goodyear ClO5 multi V-belts was
installed to drive the No. 8 Circular
Saw at a large firm of Sydney Timber
Merchants, Vanderfield & Reid Ltd.
Operating at 950 R.P.M. from a 35
H.P. motor, the V-belts drive from
an BV2 O.D. pulley to one 13% O.D.
The saw operates, on the average, 6
hours a day, 5 days a week. That
means that these Goodyear V-belts
have worked about 22,500 hours over
15 years. So that’s a long time. So
they’re Goodyear belts. They’re made
to take it.
With reliable performance like this,
it’s no wonder that this firm insists on
all Goodyear rubber products.
CASE HISTORY 2
At the North Melbourne Bedford St.
plant of Metropolitan Refrigerated
Services Pty. Limited, Goodyear Green
Seal V-belts are giving maximum
trouble-free hours at minimum cost.
Eleven D 270 Goodyear Green Seal
V-belts have been operating in the
freezer and stores side of the plant
for 10 years. The compressor is an
80 ton twin cylinder 11 in. x 11 in.
Werner. It works approximately 112
hours every week of the year.
Six D 240 Goodyear Green Seal belts
drive a 7 in. x 7 in. Werner compres-
sor, while three Wilac twin cylinder 70
compressors are each fitted with twelve
D 270 Goodyear Green Seal belts.
Both the Werner and Wilac compres-
sors are fully automatic and the belts
fitted to them are exposed to a con-
siderable amount of wear and tear. Yet
in their 4 years’ service since installa-
tion, the drives have given no trouble
at all. They have, in fact, many years
of service left.
It’s this type of reliable service that
makes Goodyear V-belts synonymous
with high quality engineering know-
how.
When you want extra driving force at
the lowest drive cost, contact your
Goodyear technical man at the Good-
year branch in your State.

We suffered severe adverse criticism . . .

ON THE MARGIN
From Frank to Fearless
TELEVISION programs about people
with non-conformist habits are arous-
ing a great deal of interest. Tireless
interviewers like Teresa Pry worth have
not only brought nudists and alcoholics
into the living-room, but have probed the
folkways of lesbians and male homosexuals.
Lesbians and male homosexuals are very
pleased with the sympathetic treatment
of their problems on TV. They feel the
public is coming to realise that the average
male homosexual is a decent sort of fel-
low, and the lesbian is not so very different
from the girl next door—indeed, she may
be the girl next door.
The same programs, however, have stir-
red envy and resentment among abnormal
groups less well-known to the public, such
as masochists, fetishists, narcissists, and
Peeping Toms. Their point of view was
expressed by a prominent fetishist. He
said: “Let’s face it the homosexuals
have been hogging prime television time.
They are more numerous and better or-
ganised than we are. They have a first-
rate public relations set-up, and good luck
to them. But we feel it is time the net-
works took an interest in the work of us
minority groups. It is hard to keep our
sense of dedication when we get so little
encouragement.”
Sadists are particularly anxious to im-
prove their public image. One of them
put it this way: “We know there is a
certain amount of prejudice against us.
If Teresa Pryworth would let us put our
case in a frank documentary, more people
would understand our point of view. We
do our best to carry on in the face of
hostile public opinion, but it is dishearten-
ing. We would like to see more mutual
respect between the average citizen and his
friendly neighborhood sadist.”
Other discontented groups include the
transvestites, hermaphrodites, necrophiles,
and exhibitionists. All of them have the
sense of not-belonging—of being different
from the ordinary run of people. They
want to be accepted. They would like
to be invited to address Apex Clubs,
present prizes on speech days, and open
art shows, just as more conventional folk
do. The first step to this kind of recog-
nition, they believe, is to appear on tele-
vision.
They argue, and on good grounds, that
they could provide program material of
high entertainment value. In a deputation
to Channel 11, a spokesman said: “Viewers
are tired of lesbians and male homosexuals.
They have become as familiar as the
Donna Reed Show. What people demand
today is something fresh and challenging,
like Transvestism In a Changing World,
or The Philosophy of the Peeping
Thomist.”
This agitation, I am glad to report, has
had effect. Teresa Pry worth has been
given the green light to go ahead with
pilot shows for a new program. In it she
will take the chair while representatives
of various off-beat viewpoints discuss ques-
tions sent in by the public. The pro-
gram will be called “Sympervium.”
I was fortunate enough to be in the
studio audience while a trial show was be-
ing taped. Teresa Pry worth announced
that the first letter was from a young lady
in Melbourne, who wanted to know: “Is
it wrong for a sadist to ill-treat a maso-
chist?”
Turning to a panel member, she said:
“I imagine you will have something to
say about this, Mr. Grimmly, as sadism is
your line of country.”
Mr. Grimmly replied: “It would be
quite opposed to my principles as a de-
cent sadist to ill-treat someone who en-
joyed it. To do so would only encourage
their regrettable weakness.”
“What do you say to that from the maso-
chistic angle, Mr. Shudder?”
“I think Mr. Grimmly’s attitude is nar-
row and self-centred. It would give him
very little trouble to hurt a harmless
masochist. After all, courtesy costs noth-
ing.”
Next to be asked his opinion was Mr.
Either, a hermaphrodite from Neutral Bay.
He shrugged and said: “I think it’s six
of one and half a dozen of the other.”
Teresa Pry worth said: “Well, there
seems to be a division of opinion here.”
She went on briskly to the next viewer’s
question: “Should an exhibitionist object to
Peeping Toms?”
A lively argument followed, during
which Mr. Shudder called Miss Window,
the panel’s exhibitionist, “a show-off.”
The enthusiasm of the studio audience
left no doubt that Channel 11 has another
popular hit. There is no affectation about
the people who take part in “Symper-
vium.” Their unnatural charm comes
through.

Vietnam’s Broken Promises
Winning the Peace
By STANLEY ANDREWS
LAST October I returned to South Viet-
nam, where since 1960 I had served
three times as an adviser on prob-
lems of rural development. On this trip
I was sent by the State Department to
appraise how United States aid could be
made more effective politically and socially
in the rural areas.
During my visits I have travelled from
Dalat and Pleiku, in the central highlands,
to Hue, in the north near the 17th parallel,
to Rachgia, in the southwest on the Gulf
of Siam, visiting villages and hamlets in
about half of the forty-odd provinces. No-
where did I hear much expression of sup-
port, not to mention enthusiasm, for the
government in Saigon. Even among the
reasonably well-to-do landowners, it was
usually something like “Now that the
Americans have come in, we will win.”
The villagers certainly were not helpful
in passing on what they knew about
Vietcong activities, even in the so-called
pacified areas. Peasants were, as always,
working quietly in the rice paddies, or
peddling nuts, pineapples, and cakes along
the roadsides or washing clothes in a
stream, apparently paying not the slightest
attention to the gunfire or the helicopters
overhead.
One explanation the villagers give for
their behaviour is that they are weary of
all the shooting and shouting that has been
going on, in one form or the other, for
nearly twenty years; another is that if they
stop their work and look up at a heli-
copter, the Vietcong will mark them as
American sympathisers and harass them;
and if they run for cover, the Americans
will take them for Vietcong and shoot them
down. I got the impression that except
for the larger landowners (fifty acres is a
big holding), the struggle for sheer survival
is stronger than any loyalty to government
or ideology.
Occasionally, when I saw a community
house or a road or some other physical im-
provement and asked how it was acquired
by the village, the usual answer, given
with a shrug of the shoulder, was, “That’s
the Americans’ building” or “That’s the
Seabees’ road.” Too often, worthwhile in-
stallations, such as a freshwater well,
are constructed by the Public Works De-
partment, with the assistance of some divi-
sion of AID or the U.S. Army, without the
local people having any idea of why it
is being built, or for whom. Perhaps no
more than ten to twenty percent of Ameri-
can aid has trickled down to the hamlets
in a way that the peasants can relate to
either the United States or their own gov-
ernment. Most of the aid has benefited
the elite and the urban middle class.
Millions upon millions of U.S. dollars,
and no little effort by the government in
Saigon, have been directed to the South
Vietnamese countryside since 1954. Today,
in every province open to the South Viet-
nam government, there is an American pro-
vincial aid representative paralleling the
Vietnamese province chief, with heavy re-
sponsibilities in every sector of the econ-
omy. When a project is proposed ; by the
local Vietnamese to his superiors in Sai-
gon, the American forwards comments and
recommendations on it to his own
superiors. But seldom are their ideas com-
pared and correlated by the two author-
ities in the capital.
The U.S. procurement system is so cum-
bersome that it is not unusual for simple
hand tools or a small pump to arrive from
six months to two years after the need
for them has been established.
In the eyes of the Vietnamese, the
American provincial representative is little
more important than was his French
counterpart under the colonial system.
Over him is a regional director respon-
sible for co-ordinating economic or quasi-
military decisions with the army as well
as with the Vietnamese. The regional
directors, one in each of the four military
districts, have ample authority in their
dealings with the U.S. Army, but they have
little authority to act in local problems.
Most of the money and effort expended
in rural Vietnam has taken the form of
programs conceived in Saigon or Washing-
ton. The Strategic Hamlets, the Mobile
Cadres, the New Life Villages, the Oil
Stain, and White and Black Area con-
cepts have all come and mostly gone.
They “looked good” at various times to
the people who tried to impose them on
the villagers, but they were often totally
unrelated to the realities of rural South
Vietnam.
Americans tend to assume that land
reform, coupled with money and technical
advice, will win them popular support in
the villages. But the problem is a great
deal more subtle and complicated. Land
reform is only one aspect of the rural
problem and perhaps not the most im-
portant, as is evidenced by the failure of
the well-intentioned and progressive (by
Asian standards) reforms inaugurated after
the Diem regime was installed in 1954.
The land problem was one of Diem’s
first concerns. The French plantations
were to be divided up and sold to peasants
through long-term loans. A land-reform
law was duly passed and local machinery
set up, when another pressing problem
intervened —the resettlement of hundreds
of thousands of refugees from the North.
Many of these were efficiently settled
either on the former French plantations
in the Mekong Delta or in the highlands.
With machinery supplied by the United
States, land was drained and then divided
in plots of five to ten acres, houses were
built, and roads and communication
systems were laid out. In no time the
settlers from the North were on their feet,
and their farms in the Delta are now
showplaces for visiting VIPs. But the
South Vietnamese who originally worked
on the big plantations did not generally
benefit from this program, and the land
reforms undertaken on their behalf were
slow to take shape.
Diem’s land reforms, where they did
operate to a degree, were designed to pro-
vide land to relatively strong and (again by
Asian standards) moderately well-to-do in-
dividuals in order to create economically
viable production units and to establish a
prosperous middle class in the .countryside.
The objective may have been laudable in
Western eyes, but the peasants found them-
selves still tenants, under new bosses and
on smaller plots of land. The system
merely confirmed the landless farmer in
his conviction that nothing good could be
expected to come out of Saigon.
Large numbers of small tracts appropri-
ated from the Freijch have been kept under
government control and are commonly put
up for rent to the highest bidder. I talked
to a villager who was farming his ancestral
acre and a half in vegetables, and paying
about $lOO rent for five acres of govern-
ment-owned rice land on which he was
allowed to plant one crop a year. By sell-
ing his vegetables he was able to buy a
few clothes and other necessities for his
nine children. The rice he planted on the
rented acres went entirely to feed his
family. Although this villager would, of
course, have liked to own the five-acre plot,
his immediate problems could be assuaged
by lifting the bureaucratic embargo on the
planting of two crops and allowing longer
rentals of government-owned land.
Another farmer in the same hamlet told
me that he desperately needed two sacks
of cement. I assumed, since his bamboo
house had only a dirt floor, that he
wanted to put in a hard floor, but he told
me he wanted the cement to make a slab
for his water buffalo to stand on so that
he could save its droppings as fertiliser
during the wet season —instead of letting
them be trampled into the mud. In another
hamlet I talked with a man who kept his
four oxen tied under a shed and carried
them green feed daily so that he could
save the manure. This was so valuable to
him that he rarely worked the oxen. The
bureaucratic answer to both problems
would be to recommend chemical fertiliser.
But getting a fifty-pound sack of ammo-
nium sulphate up a bomb-pocked road to
the villager’s little plot is no easy job. No
matter how many tons are stored in Quin-

hon or Saigon, they are still a long way
from the peasant’s reach.
Though South Vietnam has a fairly
good system of railroads and highways
and an excellent system of canal and river
transport, the sheer task of getting goods
to and from the remote countryside has
always been formidable. Now, in wartime,
with sixty percent of the railroads and an
even larger percentage of the highways
controlled or contested by the Vietcong,
the problem of logistics is almost unsur-
mountable. Everything that moves in or
out of the countryside must proceed
under a convoy, by air, or through some
accommodation with the Vietcong. With
all forms of transport controlled by a
central transportation board dominated by
the military, the difficulties are multiplied.
Civilian needs and requirements, including
port space and storage, are naturally sub-
ordinated to the military needs of a given
moment.
The failure to listen, both on the part
of the Vietnamese Government and our
own people who work in the countryside
is possibly the greatest weakness of their
combined effort to reach the rural people.
Here again the mistakes of the Diem
Government are being repeated. Diem’s
school-building efforts produced thousands
of classrooms, but supplies, textbooks, and
other essentials, including teachers, were
often lacking or slow in coming. Diem’s
health program, with its main focus on
the eradication of malaria, left most of
the villagers cold. They were inured to
the mosquito; what they wanted was
direct health services—somebody to bind
up a serious cut or set a broken leg, or a
medicine to stop dysentery.
Modest desires
IF one does listen, sitting under a tree
while the people explain their wants
and needs to the elected village chief,
who serves as their pleader to the pro-
vincial government, one is astounded at
how simple and modest their desires are.
Over the years, for example, the Saigon
Government, with U.S. assistance, has de-
veloped an extension service that includes
home-demonstration work. Extension
agents ride about the countryside on
bicycles and hold meetings on everything
from gardening to child care. Recently,
someone ordered a hundred sewing-
machines to be distributed among a group
of hamlets. A machine had arrived in
one of the hamlets I visited and an agent
was trying to teach about twenty women
how to operate and care for it. Then the
thread ran out. There was not another
spool to be had for miles around. When
I asked the agent what besides thread
would help the women in her classes, she
answered, "Some cloth to sew. All these
women have to practise on is the clothes
on their backs.”
Lack of co-ordination between the vari-
ous agencies of the central government
another major barrier, not to men-
tion the lack of it between various United
States agencies and the Saigon govern-
ment. Some years ago the South Viet-
namese Department of Public Works in-
stalled an elaborate pumping system to
supply a major canal running through a

Quay Headquarters site a convict-built tunnel. The
tunnel was exposed almost directly beneath the Mac-

shipside to the cells where they would be housed until
allocated to some place of employment. The tunnel
was also used for the movement of goods to ware-

some 850 cubic yards of solid sandstone. They had to
do this by excavating the floor of the tunnel, without
disturbing the walls or the roof arch.
After careful examination and discussion with all
concerned it was decided to remove the sandstone by
the use of explosives. As a result, the demanding
project was completed in 28 days against the 106 days
needed if pneumatic pavement breakers had been
used.

The Travels of
“Tail-End Charlie”
It’s hard to spot Ernie Grandelis when the rig is on
the move, especially when the load is a 110-ft. long
chemical storage tank. But the story of “Tail-End
Charlie,” as Ernie is nicknamed, caught the imagina-
tion of newspaper reporters in several towns during
the haulage of this vessel from Brisbane to Botany
in Sydney.
Here’s part of the story as told by The Muswellbrook

Those Extra Inches...
Overbridge heights present a constant problem to the
Brambles men who must plan the haulage of long,
high, wide and heavy loads. Often, a matter of one
foot can make all the difference to the route a heavy
haulage rig can follow, with all the extra costs
involved for lengthy detours.
The job was to carry a waste heat boiler from Sydney
to the Hunter River Islands. Manufactured by Bab-
cock & Wilcox, of Regents Park, Sydney, the unit
was 16 feet 4 inches high and weighed 32 tons. The
journey from Sydney to Newcastle meant passing
under the new Expressway overpass at Mount White,
which has a maximum clearance of 17 feet 6 inches.
The height of the load and the low bridge ruled out
the use of a normal heavy haulage float, the load
would be several feet too high. But a road clearance
of one foot had to be maintained. The problem was
solved by fabricating a special cradle and carrying the
boiler between two large steel beams, which can be
seen in the photograph.
The load went under the overpass . . . the clear-

sections of the tower crane are on the left. The
Brambles Industrial Services crane men used 140 feet
of main jib plus 30 feet of fly jib on the mobile unit.
The scene is Brisbane and the new P.M.G. Tele-
phone Exchange.
The job: To dismantle a Favco Tower Crane work-
ing from the roof of the building, 140 feet up.
The problems: The mobile crane had to be
manoeuvred through a passageway allowing only
Vs" headroom and lVz inches side clearance to
reach the siie, then placed so that maximum lifting
capacity could be achieved whilst leaving room
for P.M.G. mail trucks to enter the loading bays in
use 24 hours a day.
Successful? Certainly . . . and ahead of schedule,
too.

LIFT THAT LOG
■ ■ ■
Today’s materials handling techniques are becoming more and
more specialised and with the advances in techniques come
advanced equipment. CHEP Sales & Service, Towmotor dis-
tributors for New South Wales, are supplying modern fork
lift trucks to meet a variety of needs.
At Casino, in New South Wales, the timber company of
Messrs. Bennett Bros, is now using a fork lift truck supplied
by Chep Sales & Service, to speed timber handling at its busy
mill.
The unit is a Towmotor 25,000-lb. capacity unit and it was
selected by the company after a careful survey of all avail-
able equipment. The truck was found to be ideal for the
rough and tumble work it must perform around the timber
yard. Sawn timber and logs can be stacked higher, and more
safely with greater speed with the help of the new “one-man
gang.” Before taking delivery of the Towmotor unit, the
lifting tasks about the mill were done by a mobile crane, but
increased business and the need for greater handling capacity
and speed made the fork lift truck a worthwhile proposition.
One side issue which saves hours every week at the mill is
the speed with which the fork lift truck can lift a timber
jinker bogie on to the prime mover for transport. A task
that used to take half an hour is handled by the Towmotor
unit in a few minutes.
The fork lift truck has proved itself in the rugged conditions
of the timber yard and works efficiently and quickly, despite
the extremely rough surfaces over which it must operate.

Man’s questing after the conquest of space has meant a
tremendous upsurge in scientific activity in the fields of
astronomy and space research.
Handling sawn timber in Messrs. Bennett Bros. yard.
Australia’s C.5.1.R.0. is a leader in radio astronomy, the giant
Parkes radio telescope has succeeded in providing much new
and valuable information on the nature of the universe. New
tracking stations have been built to assist the United States
in their efforts to land a man on the moon and supplementary
research stations to provide much needed data on space con-
ditions have also been built.
A new station at Culgoora, via Narrabri, N.S.W., has been
established by the C.5.1.R.0. to provide information about
activity on the surface of the sun. The station houses a
twelve-inch solar telescope and photographic equipment to
record observations. The data is forwarded to a control centre
in the United States which analyses and collates the in-
formation and observations from similar stations in the
Northern Hemisphere. The final data obtained is used in
planning the timing of future schedules for America’s space
programme.
Brambles transported the fabricated steelwork for the
C.5.1.R.0.’s Culgoora Station and skilled steel erectors from
Brambles Industrial Services constructed the tower which
houses the solar telescope.
Accuracy and precision were essential in the construction of
the unique structure which consists of two towers —an inner
tower and outer shell. The outer shell is designed to absorb
any vibrations in the structure, caused by such things as wind,
and expansion or contraction due to temperature fluctuations.
The inner tower, which supports the all important solar
telescope and photographic equipment, is thus kept in a
“constant state.”
The photograph shows a Brambles unit lifting a section of
the tower into position.

five-thousand-acre tract of rich land in
the Mekong Delta. But the Ministry of
Agriculture apparently was not consulted
and no provision was made for ditches to
feed the water into the fields, or for
teaching the peasants how to make the
most of their land. In the autumn of 1965,
peasants in the area were still farming
as they had for years without the extra
irrigation. When a local representative of
the Public Works Department was asked
why there were no lateral ditches, he re-
plied. “Our job was to build this facility,
not to use it.”
The regional U.S. agricultural officer
in the Danang area, a tall, rugged Texan
named Lloyd Cleburne, visits every pro-
vince in his area each week by
jeep, light plane, or foot. Last autumn he
met with the elders of a Montagnard
village in the highlands and talked to
them about what they would need for
their gardens and small crops in the
coming season. It was decided that hoes,
shovels, garden seed, and a little fertiliser
would be all that was required. A date
two months off was set for the delivery
of the materials, and the villagers plan-
ned a big celebration for the day. To
make good on this promise the tools had
to be secured from a warehouse in
Danang, the fertiliser—six tons of it —
had to be flown up from Saigon, and
someone had to fly to Saigon to purchase
the seed and bring it back.
The day before the big event, the fer-
tiliser plane was scheduled to arrive from
Saigon and proceed with the Danang
party to the village in the highlands. But
during the night it was decided that the
plane had to be used for a military
operation, and the fertiliser was dumped
on the side of the airstrip in Danang.
The whole project came to a halt.
A couple of years ago the AID program
launched a widely heralded pig-corn pro-
gram for rural villages. Pigs are prized by
Vietnamese peasants not only as food but
as a traditional form of dowry. In one of
the northern provinces that year floods
had destroyed most of the livestock, and
to fill the need some two hundred hogs
were gathered in a pen at Saigon. But
with both highways and railroads out of
commission, the only way to get the ani-
mals up there was to fly them in or try
to get precious coastal shipping, tightly
controlled by both armies. The program
had to be “scrubbed” for lack of transport,
to the dismay of the village people and
to the discredit of their tireless little dis-
trict chief.
Too often, promises, even those made
by the Americans, are no sooner given
than forgotten. In another village a chief
told me: “We get nothing but promises
from all of you. We have been trying to
get a little dispensary for our people. We
were told we could have this two years
ago, but we still have not even had a
bottle of iodine, either from Saigon or
from our provincial government.” Later,
investigation by Americans in Saigon re-
vealed that warehouses in Saigon held
hundreds of portable dispensary units, com-
plete with simple drugs and instruments
that could be set up within hours in a
bamboo shed. Getting a dispensary from
Saigon to this remote hamlet was
apparently more difficult than hauling a
bomb from the United States and dropping
it on a remote Vietcong stronghold in the
jungle.
The Vietcong, in contrast, have an ex-
cellent reputation for keeping their
promises. If a farmer has harvested his
rice and is ready to sell it at the govern-
ment price of, say, 16 piastres per kilo and
the Vietcong agent comes along and offers
32 piastres, the money will be delivered
to him on time. As an American soldier
doing civil-action work close behind the
fighting in the Danang area told me, “The
Vietcong keep their promises to the villages
whether it is to pay double for their
rice or to cut off the head of the hamlet
chief.”
Whatever government replaces the
military junta as a result of the promised
elections, it will have to surmount the same
familiar barriers of communications and
logistics. In order to be regarded as a
government that responds and serves the
villages, who still represent 80 percent
of the population, any regime in Saigon
must in fact both respond and serve. It
will have to halt the blatant ballyhoo
and propaganda and open the way to a
flow of understanding from the lowest
level to the highest. Decentralisation of
the government structure to give maximum
initiative to the authorities closest to the
people would cut red tape and permit
promises to be fulfilled at last.
The effort to help the rural population
and win its loyalty has been brought to
a halt by the current crisis. When it is
over, both the United States and South
Vietnam Governments will have to revise
drastically the order of priorities to break
down the existing barriers and attack the
problem with vigor. It is probably the
last chance either will ever have.


The T-V.I.P.S
One Big Party
BY CHARLES HIGHAM
“FTIHE aunts come to Melbourne. They
say, we’ll see three things the
Shrine. The Museum . . . And
me!” The speaker was Graham Kennedy,
a coolly controlled man in his early
thirties with slightly protuberant, very
pale blue eyes which never seem to swerve
or flicker. His slight body in the checked
tweed sports jacket and slacks, the set
of his jaw, carried a slightly defensive,
determined air. Only a faint trembling
of his mouth suggested his famous ner-
vousness, his shyness. Otherwise, he was
civil, careful, and very much the self-
observer during a conversation that lasted
close to an hour in his star’s caravan at
GTV9 in Melbourne.
The reverence toward himself as an
institution was calmly assured, not boast-
ful. Kennedy is, of course, just as per-
manent as those other Melbourne monu-
ments he mentioned. For nine years,,
almost without a break, he has set the:
tone for the television talkers, for the
masters of ceremonies or stars or repartee,,
in Australia: none has matched his
longevity or his skill, but everyone has:
tried for his crown.
In the past, there has been a procession
of challengers: the silken, facetious Digby
Wolfe, white-tuxedoed smoothie from the
British nightclub-cum-B-picture circuit;
McCall and Brill, ill-fated refugees from
the American showbiz underbrush (still
seen, like ghosts in the machine, adverti-
sing paint in commercials); and Dave
Allen, Irish unpredictable, and memorably
injured on camera after venturing on to a
trampoline. All the casts used Australian,
television as a stepping-stone to careers:
abroad; those who have committed them-
selves firmly to the Australian market,,
most notably Kennedy, Bobby Limb, and 1
Don Lane, have experienced the strongest
audience response, and have tended to
stay the course.
It is significant that the most popular
shows —Graham Kennedy’s and Don
Lane’s —are, respectively, almost and en-
tirely “live.” The occasional clumsinesses,,
the fluffs on camera, the sudden descents:
into vulgarity, all are desirable to the-
audience which wants to feel it can see
something natural, unfaked, and as simple-
hearted as the Christmas party at the
neighbors’.
This amateur look can, of course, go
too far as the Bob Crosby shows proved.
It is essential the interviewer be briefed
on the interviewees, and, if possible,
acquainted with them beforehand, so that
those awful embarrassed pauses which dis-
figured Bob Crosby’s interviews can be
avoided. The amateur look can only be
fully achieved by the application of con-
siderable professionalism, giving a show a
casual appearance which a good deal of
behind - the - scenes work has painfully
achieved.
Apart from this necessary “casual” air,
the shows follow no fixed formula. Graham
Kennedy keeps up a running commentary
interspersed with commercials that fre-
quently are presented with a touch of wit.
Don Lane begins his show sitting on a
high stool, getting the audience into the
right mood, then switches to a desk where
he interviews a succession of personalities
carefully “screened” for camera presence
and for ability to talk on an interesting
subject. Bobby Limb simply moves
smoothly through a part-nostalgic, part
middle-of-the-road modern musical per-
formance; so does Jimmy Hannan, with a
show geared more to the teenage or young
adult audience. Ray Taylor’s show folded
partly because he did not have the com-
mon touch, and partly because he came
up against Graham Kennedy after a
switching around of Melbourne time slots.
Bob Crosby lacked youth, a feeling for
Australian audiences, and a satisfactory
format.
Of all the local masters of ceremonies
Graham Kennedy is easily the most durable
and, with a combined income from Chan-
nel 9 and from percentages of commercials
of about S2OOO a week, almost certainly
the highest paid. Subdued and polite off-
screen, he comes to life on camera with a
seemingly endless stream of party chatter,
commenting on everything from the boys
in Vietnam to monogrammed underwear.
The army of mums likes to see how far
he can go without actually being cen-
sorable on camera. His shyness makes them
want to mother him; the spontaneity of the
program assures its appeal to both sexes.
Kennedy said he deliberately fostered the
show’s casual air. “At first, when I started
it back in 1957, I was terrified. Every-
thing went wrong. To tell the truth, I
can’t remember anything that happened
that first night.
“It was only later, when something hap-
pened like scenery falling down and hitting
someone, that the show began to acquire
a personality of its own.” He had gradually
realised that the mistakes, fluffs, should not
be ironed out, but should be exploited in-
stead. “People like the thought of some-
thing unexpected about to happen. They
wonder what’s going to happen next, if
I’m going to say something too close to
the bone, or if there’s going to be a mis-
hap in the studio.”
More reserved, controlled, and quiet
than, say, Jimmy Hannan, ‘ Kennedy has
the most practised on-camera technique of
any Australian TV compere, and the
quickest intelligence. He barely seems to
be conscious of the camera, and this gives
his show its feeling of intimacy (“You
are,” he said, “eavesdropping on a conver-
sation”). It is this same technique that
makes some of the talk jockeys on radio
so successful.
How had he learned his ability to ad
lib? “On radio. I played against a well-
known comedian of the ’fifties. At first
I was just a boy in the show, acting as a
foil. But letters started to come in to me
as well.
“Finally, I made a name. In 1957 I
took part in a Red Cross show on GTV9.
Colin Bednall, who was then in charge
here, asked me if I’d like to go on TV
live five nights a week. I was scared. But
somehow I did manage to go on. I think
my appeal as a boy had been that the
mums thought I looked thin and pale, and
wanted to take me home to dinner. I
still think my appeal has something to do
with that.”
He said that today the show was virtually
live, that only the opening black-out sketch
and one or two commercials were prepared
in advance and taped. The rest of the
show was sketched out, that was all. The
skill of Rod Kinnear who has been
with the show since the beginning, when


he was a member of the camera-crew—
overcomes any specific problems, and Ken-
nedy’s ability to ad lib ensures that there
are no disastrous on-camera lapses.
“I’ve stopped interviewing,” Kennedy
says, “because interviews make me ner-
vous. Occasionally we introduce special
features: at the moment I drive my
desk off the set at the end of the
show like a car, although that device has
had its day now and I’ll be dropping it
soon.
“We don’t like to use pre-recordings.
As a rule, if a singer has to have his songs
pre-recorded we don’t use him on the
show.”
Kennedy had, of course, never conquered
Sydney. “The reason is, we haven’t been
on there ‘live.’ We used linked-up video-
tape sections for Sydney presentation and
this didn’t work. I’d have to do a show
from Sydney once a week. To be there, to
talk about things going on there, right on
air. But the problem is that to make room
for me the Sydney channel would have to
make major shifts in top time slots. And
then, I’m lazy. I don’t like the idea of
flying up there once a week.”
What about the future? Could he go
on indefinitely? “There has been no sign
in 10 years of people getting tired of the
show, and I imagine we could go on
always. Some weeks are obviously better
than others. Just recently we’ve had quite
a bit of activity—we took in Puckapunyal,
showed kids who are off to Vietnam, and
those are kids who may be killed next
month. We’ve had a joke or two about
Bob Dylan. When things are happening
locally the show obviously picks up.”
Don Lane, a volatile Jewish New
Yorker, was hired by
John Collins, now of
the Willard King or-
ganisation and then
working for T'CN,
while playing at a
Honolulu nightclub. Wayne Newton,
appearing at the same club, had suggested
Collins see the show, and as a result Lane
had been hired as a temporary replace-
ment for Dave Allen after Allen left the
station. Since his successful debut, Lane
had risen rapidly, partly due to a skilful
grasp of local audience requirements. Like
Kennedy, he wanted a casual, unrehearsed
look in the show.
“Joe Factory out there wants to feel he
asked the questions,” Don Lane said over
coke-on-the-rocks at his Sydney harbor-
side duplex. “If I were running a show
in the States and someone said something
on interview I didn’t agree with, I’d get
in an argument. I’d bawl him out! They
love that there! Here I bawl him out, they
think I’m smart-assing myself around.
Here I have to say to him, ‘Look, I see
it this way,’ and take it—gently—from
there.
“I’ll give you an example. I had the
Rolling Stones on the show. I said to one
of them, ‘Why do they call you the Rolling
Stones?’ He said, ‘You know that’s just the
thousandth time someone asked me that
question.’ In the States I’d have flown off
the handle. Here I said”—Lane settled his
face into a look of winsome patience—
“ ‘Well, I’m sorry, but I just don’t happen
to know the answer’.”
People became far more involved in
TV here (“Why? Because there isn’t any-
thing else”). The phenomenon of TV
critics was unknown anywhere else in the
world. “People come up to me at football
matches and they sav t 0 me why have „'t

Lanes shows main strength came from
the interviews he referred to, and sub-
jects were carefully screened foi presence
ability to carry on a conversation.
Lane said that he never minded letting
someone else take over the limelight but
that sometimes he felt the audience took
the attempts of other people to monopolise
the camera on his show too seriously. “In
a ‘Dean Martin Show’ in the States,
someone like' Frank Sinatra would say
things off camera to maybe put Martin
off balance. Here you’d get headlines next
day, ‘Martin’s nose put out of joint by
Frankie.’ In the States no one would
notice. So I have to remember if I
oppose anyone on the show it’s going to
make headlines because TV is just
about the only big local show-business
news.”
Bobby Limb’s show, like Don Lane’s,
is packaged by the NLT organisation (of
ARTS AND ENTERTAINMENT
which Limb is a partner) and aims at an
easy, relaxed family atmosphere. But
Limb doesn’t feature interviews, and un-
like Lane’s “open end” format on the
“Tonight Show,” Limb’s for “The Sound
of Music” is absolutely watertight.
The show is planned in minute detail
with Limb, the director, the scriptwriter,
the choreographer, and the technical
people, conferences beginning on Wednes-
day. They discuss broad ideas within a
strict format which calls for the program
to be divided into specific segments, be-
ginning with an “Evergreen” segment fol-
lowing the opening scene and titles: this
involves the singing of nostalgic numbers
either by single or group ensembles. There
is usually a musical interlude following
the second commercial break and then the
second segment, “Requests.” Finally,
there is a medley from a musical comedy
in which the bulk of the company takes
part. The final segment is known as “foot
tappin’ ” and involves the entire company,
terminating with Bobby Limb in an
audience participation format dancing with
an old lady.
Although there is room for flexibility,
this scheme is strictly adhered to each
week. The Wednesday conference takes
in matters like wardrobe, shots, lighting
effects, and the question of musical
arrangements. Limb engages an eight-man
team of arrangers on a freelance basis.
Every singer on the show is required
to be able to read music. On Thursday,
complete co-ordination takes place between
t^ie wardrobe and music divisions. On
Friday, the singers come in and rehearse
ln , tha studl ° and *e harmonising is

final run through and videotaping,
Limb, with his long experience on the
stage, British television, and Australian
television from its earliest years, insists on
absolute professionalism in every part of
his show. He says he never brings on
new performers, does not use teenagers,
and gets annoyed when he gets letters from
beginners looking for singing jobs. The
teamwork is close and complex, and run
with an iron hand. The show’s format
scarcely varies from year to year, and
Limb has no intention of having a top-
rated show. “The long-running show is
usually the middle of the road one. If
you’re at the top, there’s no place to go
but down.”
Limb insists that his is not a “nostalgic”
show. He says that just as many numbers
0 f recent vintage are used. But he pointed
out that his appeal is to’ the 25-30 years
bracket and upwards; he has no in-
tendon of appealing to teenagers,
who, he feds, are
well catered for else-
where. The Willard
King organisation is
NLT’s only signifi-
cant rival as a
packager of shows, and it appears to be
surviving its flops with Ray Taylor and
Bob Crosby. The organisation’s young,
smooth David Joseph was in good spirits
when I saw him in April; two of his
shows “Kommotion ” a teenage package,
and ; he J‘ mm y Hannan show,
were, he said, doing very well,
Willard Ki ’ ng>s ’ amble had been
to make a $4OOO pilot for “Kommotion,”
using Channel 0, Melbourne, studio space.
They had peddled the pilot around for
months before, finally, Channel 0 took an
option, guaranteeing the show air play
provided that Channel 10 in Sydney (the
sister channel) agreed to come in on the
deal. But Channel 10 turned the show
down, and Willard King was forced to
make an arrangement whereby the show
wou ld only play in Melbourne and King
would shoulder the problem elsewhere,
Today the show goes through various
channels in individual States.
Meanwhile, Willard King had obtained
rights to package the “Ray Taylor Show.”
“This did very well for a time,” Joseph
said. “But the station switched it to a
Monday night to compete with Kennedy,
Ray’s fine, but he doesn’t, let’s face it,
have the mass appeal that Kennedy has.”


What were some of Willard King’s
major problems? "Apart from Artransa in
Sydney, there is no mliy equipped studio
independent of the various channels,”
josepn said. “This means it is very
dniicult to set up complete packages in
the American sense produced, directed,
and written entirely by an independent
outfit and sold intact.
“As it is, we have to go into co-produc-
tion with the studio. We produce the show,
provide the stars and sets and supporting
players, while the studio supplies the direc-
tors and technicians. Only ‘Kommotion’ is
fully packaged by us, and it is the only
fully packaged show in the whole country.
“But we do plan to set up our own
studio to make complete packages.” The
cost of this, he hoped, would be partly
defrayed by selling shows to nearby mar-
kets—Hong Kong, Singapore, and Japan.
One problem not faced by similar out-
fits in America was that frequently a
station ownership had to be sold on the
name of a star before the star was signed,
and that no pilot, obviously, could be
arranged with an overseas performer like
Bob Crosby. “But Bob’s name was enough
for ATN and its associated stations,”
Joseph said. “We just had to deliver him
in a package for a 13-week trial, that’s
all.”
Production headaches on the Crosby
show were endless. For instance, Crosby
recorded his Sydney and Melbourne shows
on two successive nights, in Sydney and
Melbourne consecutively, and this proved
a strain. And then, of course, there was
the chronic problem of money. “The audi-
ence here demands shows as good as
American shows on a fraction of the bud-
get. A top budget for our shows would be,
say, $BOOO here, whereas in America it
would be close to a quarter of a million.”
The problem boiled down to the old one
of population, limited market, and the
demand for quality by that small popula-
tion market. But Joseph seemed confident
that immediacy and strong local appeal
would more than compensate for any
roughnesses in his shows.
Jimmy Hannan, one of Willard King’s
stars, agreed. He told me he had 1|
hours rehearsal as against the 16 hours
allowed in similar shows in the United
States, but felt that the occasional fluffs
resulting from this, the “live” feeling of
his rapidly videotaped productions, is an
advantage in an Australian context.
“People here unlike Americans or
Canadians like to feel you can make
the occasional mistake. It’s like saying,
‘He’s our brother, and he dropped a ham-
mer on his toe.’ It makes them feel close
to you.”
The tendency, Hannan said, is more and
more to go as “live” as possible; in the
United States, of course, shows had to be
as slick, as polished as possible. Here,
that didn’t work as well, although he
would like more preparation time (and
there’s the problem of the shortage of top
talent: “You can’t just pick up the phone
and call Frank Sinatra.”)
Hannan is unusual among the top TV
names in Australia in that he had his
beginnings in the record business, went to
Canada for four years and worked as
part of a singing group, and returned to
become a local star without having be-
come a big name overseas. Arriving in
Toronto after winning a prize here (on a
show run by Bruce Gyngell, now Chief
Executive of TCN9 in Sydney) for naming
50 song titles, Hannan joined CBC after
nearly 400 others had been eliminated as
applicants to do the choral backing on the
top-rated “Country Hoedown” show; he
was hired after four days of solid auditions.
Among his first directors was Norman
Jewison, currently a top Hollywood
director (“The Thrill of It All,” “Send
Me No Flowers,” “The Cincinnatti Kid.”)
He was taught by CBC to sing and dance
(he believes that such training should
be more common here), appeared on the
Jack Paar and other shows, but felt that
his future (“Canada is for the Canadians
—I sometimes wonder if we should work
on the same principle”) lay in Australia
rather than there. He returned, appeared
on “In Sydney Tonight,” and finally got
his own quiz show, “Say When;” he enjoys
his swimming-pool and uncomplicated
home life with the relish of a man without
complexes.
Another Willard King personality, Ray
Taylor, was very different. So often a
comeback man as to be a kind of Old
Pretender to Kennedy’s King and Don
Lane’s heir presumptive, he has always
lacked a real contact with a mass
audience. David Joseph said: “Ray’s a
very specialised person with a specialised
appeal. He doesn’t appeal to Mrs. Fitz-
roy or Mrs. Carlton they wouldn’t
know what he was talking about half the
time. So, obviously, it’s a mistake to do
a big budget show there isn’t going to
be a big audience for Ray. Our newly
planned show is to be half-an-hour long,
and will run late at night nationally. It
will be directed by John Collins.”
Collins, an incredibly energetic figure who
seems to crop up in every part of show
business life here, also produced the ill-
fated Bob Crosby show. Crosby’s sup-
porters claim that Collins and the Willard
King organisation notably failed to pro-
vide Crosby’s show with a satisfactory
packaging. It was said that studio space
at ATN was unavailable for rehearsals,
that there were a host of technical hitches,
and that Crosby had to take a guitar-
player’s wages out of his own salary. He
is also said to have offered to pay, him-
self, for a first-class script-writer, if one
could be found, and to have resigned in
frustration as early as March, long before
the celebrated Mavis Bramston skit.
It has also been suggested that Crosby
thought he was coming out to a com-
pletely packaged (in the American sense)
show. He thought it would be fully
directed and produced by professionals
and presented to the studio in its finished
form. Others say that he treated his Aus-
tralian sojourn as a holiday, spent too
much time at the golf course, took too
little or no interest in his interviewees, and
failed to audition them personally.
From the first, certainly, Crosby wore a
defeated look, the look of a man who has
played too many engagements in the
American hinterland. The image of the
sad, ineffectual, tired man was altogether
wrong for Australian TV success, which
depends on a rawly extrovert bounciness,
physical vitality and pace, and a deep
understanding of the audience’s needs.
Whatever the faults of Willard King (and
the show certainly had a very clumsy look)
the simple fact is that Crosby didn’t have
the right personality, or the youth, for
audiences here to respond to him in the
vast numbers essential for the right ratings.
The shortage of suitable interviewees a
chronic Australian problem can only be
overcome here if the interviewer himself
does most of the work, and uses them as
part of his own act.
The success of Lane, Kennedy, Limb,
and Hannan, and the failure of Crosby
and Taylor, should clearly chart the way
for any future local (Ed Devereaux is said
to have been tested for the role of com-
pere of a new ATN show) or overseas
entertainer who wants to break into the
big time in this medium. Taylor’s too-
clever sophistication and Crosby’s too de-
pressed look and lack of apparent involve-
ment with his environment have both
proved disastrous to ratings. A combina-
tion of tough extroversion (Lane), quick-
wittedness and Mum appeal (Kennedy),
simple-hearted directness (Limb), and
boyish bounciness (Hannan) should do the
trick—plus, of course, an open-end for-
mat that doesn’t get too open-end, that
combines a casual, partyish look with a
good deal of know-how behind the scenes.
We want to eavesdrop on the fun, but we
don’t want the compere to look as though
he’d rather face a firing squad than the
cameras. He’s our uncle, after all, and
we want him to enjoy himself, too.
THEATRE
A Little Learning
The Blue Stockings. Moliere. Graduate
Theatre Company. Union Theatre, Syd-
ney.
DRAMA, long moribund at Sydney
University, appeared to have finally
died some time last year. Graduate
Theatre is a company formed by a group
of graduates in an attempt to resurrect
it. Mo,here’s play was presumably chosen
for the first production in the expectation
that a classical comedy would appeal to
a university audience. On the first night
it was presented to a mainly invited
audience of professors and their wives.
“The Blue Stockings,” first played in
Paris in 1672, is an attack on feminine
pedantry. Learning having become fash-
ionable among the ladies, they proclaim
that reason, not feeling, must rule their
lives. But, as the course of the action
reveals, they are not able to shake off
the old Eve so easily. Neither, since
a little learning is dangerous and a little
learning is all they possess, are they able
to distinguish good verses from bad nor
true scholars from plausible rogues.
The trouble with the play is that, since
there are fashions in pedantry as well
as in hats, much of Moliere’s doubtless
witty send-up of the current learned
idiocies is dated and no longer funny.
(An exception is Moliere’s skit on the
Leavis method in the scene in which the
ladies do a bit of detailed literary appre-

ciation of Trissotin’s vile poem: phrase by
phrase and word by word.)
It is possible, however, that a very
stylish production would revivify the play
and whirl the audience lightly through
the tedious bits. “Love’s Labor’s Lost,” for
example, which also contains a lot of
dead jokes against pedantry, has been
rescued for the contemporary British stage
after centuries of disfavor by the liveliness
of modern British Shakespearian acting,
helped by modern scholarship.
But the Graduate Theatre production
is ragged and, except for a few restrained
performances, disgracefully over-acted. It
might be thought that the university
audience would be tolerant of this pro-
duction while the critics would be harsh.
But exactly the opposite was the case.
Coming out into the foyer at interval I
discovered that my university friends were
not merely bored but quite angry. “But,”
I said, tolerantly, “it is not as bad as a
lot of the productions I see.” “Your
standards have been ruined,” they replied,
Next day the critics in the daily papers
were also indulgent,
But if Sydney is to have classical
drama, and surely it should, audiences
such as this will be necessary to support
it. Obviously, they will not do so un-
less standards are raised. Therefore, it
is no use we critics sitting in the aisle seats
tolerantly watching inferior dramatic pro-
ductions while the potential audience sits
at home tolerantly watching television,
Nor is it any use drama groups like
Graduate Theatre expecting to attract
audiences unless they can improve their
standards. What is the best way of doing
this is another question,
MADELEINE ARMSTRONG
Pig-boy and Sun-God
The Royal Hunt of the Sun. Peter Shaffer.
Russell Street Theatre, Melbourne.
"X WAS suckled by a pig!” croaks the
vehement old Pizarro. “My home is
the oldest in Spain. The pig-sty!” He
has returned to the village of his illegiti-
mate childhood to recruit men for an
expedition to 24-carat Peru. While his aim
is bluntly secular, Goya’s sinister priests
are on hand to charge the gold-hungry
with a divine purpose; they are to become
the huntsmen of Cod and must beat the
pagan from his dark forest. So 187 men
set out to piously pillage a nation of
24,000,000. All of which Peter Shaffer
presumes to dramatise with 26 actors in
two acts.
When, in 1962, Shaffer graduated from
five-finger exercises to the Wagnerian
orchestration of “total theatre,” London
critics were as awed with the result as
Pizarro’s men were by the Andes. Like
the Spanish mercenaries, they fell to their
knees, breathing reverent superlatives. With
ballet, mime, and visual extravagance
supporting a theme of triumphant human-
ism, it was held to be perhaps the great
play of its generation. Inevitably, ardor
cooled for subsequent productions, and
in the revised estimate the play was seen
as merely a luscious piece of costume
jewellery.
It’s hard to draw a conclusion on the
basis of this second Australian production.
Well over an hour has been cut from the
text, and the Russell Street stage is too
small to accommodate a triumphant spec-
tacle. The producer’s theatrical devices
are alternately enthralling and embar-
rassing, and Shaffer’s dialogue is similarly
a mixture of the almost sublime and the
faintly ridiculous.
For instance. Pizarro’s men must mime
their march across Peru’s eerie terraced
cornfields and their terrifying climb over
the Andes. Here they are really on danger-
ous ground, for the sight of a score of
otherwise naturalistic actors simultane-
ously Marcel Marceau-ing teeters on the
edge of the ludicrous. But when a great
red cloth haemorrhages over the stage to
symbolise a massacre, one can agree with
the Melbourne playwright who was moved
to cry out “bloody marvellous!”
The lines that Shaffer has given his
crusty, existential old hero powerfully
combine the vulgar and the poetic. (In-
undated by the Inca’s ransom he sneers
“the cripples have gold crutches, the
coughers spit gold snot.”) But too much
of the dialogue is made up of big-deal
rhetoric and such desk-calendar quotes as
“fame is long, death is longer.” The Inca,
Atahuallpa, has particular cause for com-
plaint in this regard, when, having had
his wings clipped in the second act, he’s
reduced to mouthing the sort of pidgin
favored by native chiefs in Tarzan films.
But it is in this second act, when most
of the razzle-dazzle has subsided, that the
play begins to succeed dramatically. The
pig-boy that caught a God becomes cap-
tivated by his captive. The Inca’s innate
nobility fascinates Pizarro, while the young
man’s utter belief in his own divinity over-
whelms his agnosticism. Pizarro is a man
who lost all joy the day he realised he
was mortal. He is contemptuous of armies,
churches, and States which he sees as
being absurd defences erected to protect
men’s imaginations from eternal darkness.
He sneers, too, at morality, hope, and life
itself yet becomes increasingly con-
vinced that the Inca is, in fact, the son
of the Sun, and that he can, as he insists,
be killed yet live again with the dawn.
And so, when the Inca is finally brought
to Christ and garotted, Pizarro keeps a
vigil over the body of what has become
both his God and his son. When the
Sun fails to ressurect Atahuallpa, Pizarro
rages over the corpse, only to come to a
new realisation: that while the heavens are
blind to him, he at least can see the
heavens. He forgives his God that failed
with the words “there’s some immortal
work there, surely” and faces his own im-
minent death with something approaching
equanimity.
Edward Hepple has been accused of
playing Pizarro superficially and care-
lessly. But, to me, the once-removed
quality he gave much of his part was
appropriate to a man cauterised by his
fear of death. As the Inca, David Turn-
bull sang, danced, strutted, and bellowed
splendidly, half monarch, half peacock.
George Whaley—the actor with the mania-
cal eyes—was his usual compelling self as
the narrator Martin Ruiz, and Clive Win-
mill impressed as Friar Marcos.
The setting, made up of gaunt, black
panels covered in abstract-expressionist
impasto, and dominated by a sun-like
aperture which irised out to reveal the
resplendent Inca, was designed by Kristian
Fredrikson who also prepared the im-
pressive massacre and funeral masks.
Wendy Dickson’s costumes have the needed
emphasis to the vulnerability of the almost
somnambulistic Peruvians and to the
metallic forcefulness of the conquistadors.
And Ogilvie made excellent use of his
hypnotic music and sound effects. Given
a larger stage, budget, and company, “The
Royal Hunt” might have been better able
to obscure its weaknesses.
PHILLIP ADDAMS
FILMS
A burnt-out case
The Spy Who Came In From the Cold.
Director, Martin Ritt. Paramount
Theatre, Sydney.
COMING as a brutally stimulating anti-
dote to the sleek artificiality of the
James Bond movies and their imita-
tors, Martin Ritt’s film presents the pro-
fession of spying not as a glamorous,
exciting world of girls, master criminals,
and luxury but as a shabby, dirty business
in which such human values as loyalty and
justice must always come a very poor
second to expediency.
Even if your cause is just, you must
fight a dirty enemy with his own weapons
explains “Control,” the head of the secret
service (Cyril Cusack’s schoolmarmish
performance as this deadly man is one of
the best things in the film, which is true
in both letter and spirit to John le Carre’s
novel).
Martin Ritt presents the story with bleak
economy and a minimum of „ director’s
tricks; only in his occasional over-indul-
gence in close-ups is the film at all
idiosyncratic. The grainy black-and-white
photography is straightforward and effec-
tive, deliberately emphasising the ugliness
of many of the backgrounds, the dreari-
ness of the European weather —the people
in the story, one feels, carry their own
inclement climate with them.
But it is the casting and the perform-
ance which impress above everything else.
Richard Burton for the first time in many
films really appears as an actor, not as
the Voice Beautiful or the Personality in
the News; he wins belief in and sympathy
for Leamas, the burnt-out, disillusioned
man who always finds one more disillusion-
ment in store.
Claire Bloom, whose subdued, elusive
charm has often failed to register on
the screen, gives perhaps her best per-
formance here as the idealist Marxist with
her simple faith in freedom, peace, and
the brotherhood of man.
BEVERLEY TTVEY


TELEVISION
On Moonlight Bay
Adult Theatre. Channel 10, Sydney.
THE television channels which are
characterised by a zero somewhere
in their call signs have begun a
program reshuffle which has brought some
shows to an end, changed the times of
others such as “66 And All That” and
“Jimmy,” reintroduced old series, and
introduced a few new ones. Among the
few are a new “Candid Camera,” a
“Garry Moore Show,” and “Adult
Theatre.” The latter promises much, but
started on the wrong foot with a wasted
hour titled “Don’t Call Me Any Dirty
Names.” That proved a difficult thing
to avoid.
“Adult Theatre” represents an ambitious
attempt to use a repertory company of
ten experienced U.S. actors in TV plays
by some notable writers including, we are
told, the late Clifford Odets, who died in
1963, a fact which dates the enterprise.
We see too few examples of America’s
occasional tries at honest drama, tries
which usually are mourned later as one
more sincere attempt smothered by the in-
terference of a sponsor or his agency.
Probably “Adult Theatre” was one of
these, although the “Don’t Call Me”
drama would have been passed OK by
Kelloggs. Billed as a “starkly controversial
drama,” it featured Lloyd Bochner and
Bethel Leslie as father and mother of a
19-year-old who had had an affair with
a young professor out in California, who
had greeted her joyful news of pregnancy
with two $lOO bills and the telephone
number of an abortionist. Daughter rang
her family in New York, undecided
whether to abort or suicide.
Mother wanted to “talk it over after
dinner,” but Dad convinced us that
Daughter was as impetuous as he, and
jetted off to the West Coast after alerting
the police, Coastguard, and possibly the
Marines. Clenching and relaxing his jaw
to show emotion a la Kirk Douglas, he
wrangled the telephone number from the
guilty professor and met the abortionist,
played by Richard Boone in his best
Paladin manner, holding his face close to
the chest as though in a tense poker game.
A Coastguard launch took Dad on a
moonlight cruise of the Bay, and returned
him to a jetty and a remarkable coin-
cidence. There, drinking coffee on that
very same jetty, was his daughter, played
limply by June Harding, a girl who has
probably the longest lip in the business and
used it to remarkable dramatic advan-
tage during the next 15 minutes, which
author John Haase filled with platitudes
drawn from some handbook of dialogue
from the 100 worst Hollywood films.
This episode of “Adult Theatre” proved
as adult as the women’s serials of Old
Radio. Technically it was first class. The
camera work and editing were wonderful,
but the plot, dialogue, and acting made
that night’s episode of “Australian Play-
house” look good in comparison, because
of its honest faults and its simplicity.

BOOKS
The Australian Tragedy
By JAMES McAULEY
Hierarchy and Democracy in Australia,
1788-1870. The Formation of Australian
Catholicism. T. L. Suttor. Melbourne U.P.
$6.50.
THIS is a very rich contribution to the
new wave of Australian historical
writing which sees men and events in
relation to issues which are intellectual and
cultural. Here it is the morphology of
Catholicism in Australia that is treated,
with attention concentrated upon the period
from 1842, when the Benedictine regime
began, to 1865, when it was becoming clear
that the dominance of secularism would
characterise education and society in Aus-
tralia.
Suttor’s composition skilfully develops
four main themes: the “ecclesiastical im-
perialism” of the Irish secular clergy versus
the Benedictine formation; the turbulence
of lay and clerical factionalism versus the
authority of the bishops; Protestant bigotry
versus disadvantaged Catholics; and secu-
larism versus the lot, though in temporary
alliance with Protestant bigotry.
“Australia,” says Suttor, “is not only
a country, it is an idea: the idea that
industrial democracy is sufficient unto
salvation, a world-view where liberty and
science and welfare and culture no longer
reflect but obscure the divine might and
loveliness. Perhaps it is the purest study
we have of secularism in vacuo, without
powerful institutions and traditions to pull
down . . . This option is the great
Australian tragedy. It is a fundamental
error on the part of our literati to imagine
that exploration is the great Australian
theme.
“Our theme is the refusal to explore
to explore God . ~ . It was dramatic-
ally swift, the work of one generation
over and done with by 1880. Here surely
is good material for a poem.” Not being
a poet, Suttor has written the history.
This is good stirring stuff, and makes me
stamp the hoof and neigh from afar, like
an old battle horse hearing the clash of
distant armor. It is true enough as a
sweeping generalisation, but not true
enough as a final statement.
L e t me accept Suttor’s appeal to the
literary witness. It isn t. true that the
literati really think exploration is the
”” theme;. where exploration is used
■" our literature it is frequently a trope
* s P‘ r ( tual exploration as in Pat-
[ lck Wl ' lte . and Douglas Sfewart. C
best poetry is evidence of a continuance of
the soul s quest for a metaphysical relation-
ship - Hope and Wright and others in
differing ways are examples of this -
and so isNnuch of the small amount o
prose which is worth consideration. At
any time the appalling volume of half-
m/ndless poems and storie s written by
p eo pi e whose metaphysical roots have
£ it f ered or been cut may seem to testify
(o (he tri h o£ the Australian “idea” as
Suttor states it; but these are summer flies
that is h.
, T , ~
1 not s a ynig, and ve never sai
*a‘ bterature should mainly have religious
or metaphysical themes: its business is more
° tan w > th . tl > e « or ! d , than wl ! h
direct relation to God. I am saying, as
I« always said that people whose meta-
physical roots a yz cr ' | ~o r ,
cut cannot deal with the world either,
They also cant understand what I m say
in §-
The other point that needs to be made
is one that Suttor doesn’t really disagree
with. The Catholics are a big part of
the actual Australia, even if not of the
Australian “idea”; and whatever the de-
formations of Catholic life under the pres-
sures of rampant history, Protestant
bigotry, and secularism, the Catholics to-
gether with genuinely religious Protestan-
tism (which God forbid I should despise
since I come from it) constitute the sub-
dominant in the scale of Australian values.
Suttor sees a tragedy within the tragedy,
namely, the defeat of the English Bene-
dictines under Polding. To him, they stood
for the hope that Catholicism would de-
velop in this country with a clerical elite
capable of absorbing the traditions of
Catholic intellectuality and broad supra-
national humanism, and a lay elite cap-
able of locally relevant social leadership as
well as intellectual culture. He sees, and
regrets, the Hibernicisation of the Church
in Australia as a process of proletarianisa-
tion, and of the injection of locally irrele-
vant Irish political passions and loyalties.
Could it have been otherwise? It seems
to me that Suttor wavers on this, reluc-
tantly recognising that the colossal work
of recalling to the faith, and establishing
anew in the faith, the mass of immigrants,
under the actual circumstances, could
never have been done without the Irish
clergy from All Hallows and yet he is
pulled back by his regrets to wondering
whether the full price really had to be
paid.
I don’t deny the price was high. The
price was high in Ireland itself for their
magnificent resistance to the English
attempt to destroy Catholicism; and in-
evitably it was their limitations and de-
formities as well as their immense strengths
that the Irish brought with them. Among
the strengths were an attachment to politi-
cal democracy deeper than that of the
Protestant ascendancy, and a tradition of
gallant courage.
The limitations of the Catholic sub-
culture are stated thus by Suttor: “There
was an excessive distrust of argument in
religious matters, a certain fear of the
body and the marriage act, a reluctance
to take Communion frequently or read
the Bible with its lusty extrovert religiosity.
And there is little doubt in my own mind
that the convents, through the parochial
schools, fostered these tendencies, along
with what has been called the ghetto men-
tality and a factitious Hibernicism.”
Suttor isn’t being ungrateful: he does
acknowledge the vast debt. It’s just that
he thinks wistfully that perhaps it didn’t
have to go quite this way.
Suttor’s hero is John Bede Polding,
the Benedictine Archbishop of Sydney. My
heroine is Mrs. Caroline Chisholm, the
greatest Catholic Australian in our history,
to whom Suttor devotes some excellent
pages full of insight. Motivated by
Christian charity, and seeing all things in
the light of Christian theology, she was
at the same time wholly above and beyond
sectarianism and sectional advantage.
Neither in the ghetto, nor obsessed with
being outside the ghetto; with her eye fixed
on the real issues, with real love in her
heart.
Suttor admits that Polding completely
failed to grasp her importance; she was not
a nun, but a happily married mother,
exercising an immense lay apostolate be-
yond the vision of Polding though
acclaimed by Protestants like Shaftesbury,
Florence Nightingale, and Dickens.
It is she who ought to be the first
Australian saint even before Mother
Mary McKillop, who has the merit of
having been excommunicated by the Bis-
hop of Adelaide, but the unfair advantage
of having a religious order propagating her
claims. Perhaps in the absence of proper
interest by the Catholic body, THE
BULLETIN might take up the cause.
A Point in Metaphysics
The two public clocks in Blauvac
express a two-minute difference
when striking the hoiir, providing
thus two minutes of timelessness
or the deceiving impression
that the hour had never struck or
that the past is retrievable*,
Butterflies hung above flower-pots
in their short, sharp movement as if
pinned to a seismograph needle,
the air quaking around them, when
the first clock slowly struck the hour;
fallen figs lay on the roadside
like deflated balloons with flies
plucking at strings of their juice;
the bees, pursuing the perfumed
air, turned from lavender to thyme;
the hills, pipelined with rows of vines,
were reservoirs for the sun’s
overflow that Provencal noon.
And then the second clock struck,
tricking the consciousness into
thinking that nothing had happened
or that everything must happen
again and again and again,
that the insects, flowers and trees,
extracting each other’s juices
in a common dependence on
the earth, had a timeless origin
or had begun now, at this hour.

WAR
WITHOUT
HONOUR
by Gerald L. Stone
For a people so involved in the Vietnam war, Australians'
are amazingly misinformed. Flag-waving and evasion by
the government, hysterical appeals from a disorganized
opposition, bigotry and a lack of the facts have resulted
in Australians being dubbed ‘the ignorant being led by
the arrogant.’
Gerald Stone spent part of last year in Vietnam as war
correspondent for the Australian. It was there he sought
out the facts that are contained in War Without Honour.
How did we become involved? Should the Allies be
there at all? What are the alternatives to our present
course of action? How could Australians have better
contributed? The answers to these and many other ques-
tions are controversial, hard-hitting and profoundly dis-
turbing. This is a book all Australians should read.

Denis Warners S.E. Asia
By GEOFFREY FAIRBAIRN
Reporting South-East Asia. Denis Warner.
Angus and Robertson. $4.50.
DURING the Monash Teach-in, a ques-
tion was asked of Mr. Warner about
which side really started the Korean
War. He was able to answer it with an
eyewitness description of the first North
Korean tanks crossing the border and the
disarray of the South Koreans. He first
saw Tokyo on 24th November, 1944, from
a Flying Fortress. He played a brave and
splendid part reporting the French war
against the Vietminh; and wrote a book
on Diem based on equally close experience.
There are few people in the world who
know so much about South-East Asian
politics in general as Mr. Warner. This
is much better recognised in the U.S.A.,
where his articles for “The Reporter,” a
selection of which make up this book,
earned him a citation from the Overseas
Press Club of New York and earlier earned
him a Nieman-Marcus scholarship to Har-
vard. That he is not more highly regarded
in Australia is due to two things: the
jealousy of those with a vested interest in
“scholarly” publications (“learned jour-
nals, footnotes, tediousness, and so forth,”
as Mr. Donald Horne once described
them) and the hostility of Leftists and
progressives for a skilled observer who for
nearly 20 years has been spelling out the
ugly realities of South-East Asia. A third
group should really be added: the un-
caringly greedy nouveaux-riches who have
long been sneeringly brushing him aside as
a “prophet of doom.”
The fine consistency of his vision makes
him an obvious target for such people and
an exemplary guide to others less hide-
bound. It is now 18 years since he edited
(with Robert Gilmore) a selection of writ-
ings on “Asia” with the marvellously well-
chosen title of “Near North.” In it he
wrote, “The Philippine Republic is only
the first of our ‘new’ neighbors. There will
be others. And the achievement of inde-
pendence will not be remote political
events without significance in vast, under-
populated Australia. Our own future may
well be linked with theirs.” Since 1949,
when he went to Japan with his wife
(who has written with charm and pene-
tration about those so very important
Everyday Things in “Asia”), he has done
yeoman service to his (until recently)
utterly insouciant country by risking his
life and health reporting, step by step,
the momentous political developments of
the Near North. The hope he expresses
for this collection of pieces that “they
will not appear just as unrelated snapshots
but more as a series of related movies,
which collectively may help toward an
understanding of what is happening in
South-East Asia and why”—is astonish-
ingly well founded.
There are three particular reasons for
the consistency of Mr. Warner’s vision.
The first is temperamental, one might al-
most say: he is a born fighting man, dour,
tenacious, combative, and so able to
understand politico-military activists to a
degree altogether denied to the wet-and-
wobbly analysts beloved of the Australian
liberal-progressive Establishment. Secondly,
he knows more about revolutionary
guerilla warfare scale and in point of
“feel” than most journalists, nearly all
diplomats, and until recently the majority
of army officers. He learned deeply from
people like our mutual friend Tran Van
Dinh, former Chief of Staff of the Com-
munist Pathet Lao Liberation Army, who
three years ago offered his services in any
capacity to Australia, a country for whom
he had a strange affection; offers which
were contemptuously dismissed by every-
one I approached on his behalf.
Above all, he is a very honest person:
though he wrote harshly, at times almost
certainly unfairly, about Diem in his “The
Last Confucian” (Penguin), a classic piece
of journalism, here unaltered is a dispatch
of August, 1961: “Some of Vietnam’s cur-
rent difficulties may certainly be attributed
to shortcomings of the administration of
President Ngo Dinh Diem. But isolated
from Communist influence, South Vietnam
under Diem and with American aid would
certainly have prospered: it was beginning
to prosper when terror hit the countryside
and halted rice deliveries to Saigon. Even
if Diem had been more liberal and demo-
cratic and his associates had all been be-
yond reproach, it is doubtful whether the
Communists would have been prevented
from gaining ground in the rural areas.
It is not true, either, that some of Diem’s
most bitterly criticised rural policies have
been brutally and unnecessarily repres-
sive.” Mr. Warner saw as early as 1959
that what was wrong about Diem’s ap-
proach (as of the Americans) was that
the lessons of the first Indo-China war had
not been learnt; the threat was seen in
orthodox military terms. His thorough
knowledge and consistency of vision allows
him to. make the same strictures on N.E.
Thailand in 1965.
It also provides him with the under-
standing to illuminate events in Laos in
a most brilliant fashion: to show how the
West (and the West possibly here in-
cludes the USSR) was diplomatically
duped in Laos by the men in Hanoi who
since 1930 have thought in terms, not of
Vietnam, but of Indo-China as the title
of Communist Party of Indo-China has
always denoted: and to demonstrate, per-
haps better than ever before, the patient
long-term manner of Communist build-up
and infiltration, leading to the existence
of the so very important “Ho Chi Minh
Trail” network—a network diplomatically
protected by the Western diplomats who
thought they had been so clever at the
1962 Geneva Conference!
This book, which covers such seemingly
disparate subjects as Chinese road-building
and New Guinea, the theory of revolution-
ary guerilla warfare and events in Indo-
nesia, the problems of Malaysia and the
often neglected U.S. bases and build-up
in Thailand, has been written over a period
fraught with disappointments, depressions,
and frustrations peculiarly deeply felt by
a clear-sighted observer who is also a pro-
foundly kind and humane man. The book
ends with the author back in South Viet-
nam again, for the umpteenth time, in
February, 1966, a little wearied by it all
and yet certainly not without hope: “This
is, of course, where we came in years ago
with land reform; the strategic hamlet pro-
gram, and what used to be called civic
action. I have been going back over
my notebooks to try to measure past ex-
pectations against results as a basis for
evaluating the present schemes. The exer-
cise, I have decided, is not only dispiriting
but also unfair. Almost everywhere that
the observer is able to travel in relative
safety one finds dedicated men at work on
programs for the rural areas. Most of
the programs lean heavily on past ex-
perience and are designed to avoid pre-
vious errors. This is true even in the
most critical areas.” Almost needless to
relate, he is up there again as this review
is being written.

Moorehead's Invaders
By M. H. ELLIS
The Fatal Impact. Alan Moorehead.
Hamish Hamilton. $3.85.
MR. MOOREHEAD in his sub-title
describes the book as an account
of the invasion of the South
Pacific 1767-1840. It is a very sketchy,
patchwork picture, full of large holes
and of unbalanced coloring and em-
phasis. He treats the voyages which im-
mediately preceded Cook’s as merely in-
cidental in making an impact on Polynesian
civilisation, and as being intrinsically
inferior in importance and prestige to those
of Cook. And he goes so far as to refer
to Hawkesworth’s account of the voyages
of Byron, Wallis, and Carteret as “for good
measure appended” to the volumes dealing
with Cook’s first voyage. Yet the earlier
voyages occupy the whole of the first
volume of “Hawkesworth” covering about
660 pages, and the remaining two volumes
of under 800 pages total deal with the
story of Cook’s voyage, which is only
padded out to that length because it con-
tains all the sociology, botany, and
ethnology recorded by Banks and his
entourage.
True to the general convention of
writers on the subject, Moorehead con-
demns poor old Hawkesworth, of whose
end it could be said that he died of
criticism—for his extravagances in the
reproduction of Cook’s narrative, his inter-
polations and absurd asides. And, as usual,
he exculpates Cook in respect of these
accretions and some errors.
He asserts that Cook had no oppor-
tunity to read the manuscript and correct it
because he was already away on his second
voyage when the volumes were published
in 1773. But Hawkesworth, who received
6000 guineas from the Governor for writ-
ing the work from the diaries of the
voyagers, seems explicit on the point. He
declares that at the instance of Lord Sand-
wich, by then First Lord of the Admiralty,
and for the most part in the latter’s
presence, the work was read to the com-
manders whose feats and adventures were
recorded. He adds that “in order to
authenticate” the story, the ghosted narra-
tive of the Endeavour voyage was first
written so that Cook could check the
manuscript before he sailed; that it was
not only read to him and checked at
the Admiralty, but also checked by Banks
and Dr. Solander, “in whose hands, as well
as in those of Captain Cook, the manu-
script was left for a considerable time after
the reading.”
Cook was piore fortunate than the other
voyagers in that he had Banks behind him;
for Banks was apt to exhibit associates
as a Shorthorn breeder exhibits a cham-
pion bull at Sydney Royal Show. Cook
had a publicity that the other modest
commanders, who had paved the way for
him, lacked.
The whole of his volumes of “Hawkes-
worth” carry the sickly sweet flavor of
Banksian adulation, which Mr. Moorehead
had apparently found a more alluring diet
than the straightforward narratives of
Byron, Wallis, and Carteret, who sailed in
the years immediately preceding Cook’s
departure.
The voyages of Byron, Wallis, the in-
trepid Carteret, and Cook between 1764
and 1770 were all integral parts of the
same enterprise.
It was Wallis who discovered Tahiti,
selected the island as the venue for the
observation of the transit of Venus, which
the Royal Society was to send Cook and
Green, the assistant Astronomer Royal, to
make in the South Pacific in 1769. And
it was Wallis and his lieutenant, Furneaux,
who established the first contact with the
Tahitians contact which represents the
really interesting moment of impact and re-
action. But neither Moorehead nor prece-
dent writers on the era and cult of the
noble savage have shown much analytical
interest in all this.
Actually, one of the most intriguing
problems concerned with an event as re-
volutionary and determinative in Poly-
nesian history as the dropping of the first
atomic bomb on Hiroshima was in a larger
sphere has never, so far as I can remem-
ber, been postulated, much less explored.
It is undoubted that the immediate re-
sponse of the inhabitants of Tahiti to the
arrival of Wallis and the Dolphin was to
mobilise their whole canoe navy fully
armed, and to attack. But the problem
is “why?” Did they regard the strange
vessel as the Eskimos regard a stranded
whale and rush in to carve up the ap-
parently helpless thing they having no
knowledge of the potency even of tower
muskets and blunderbusses, much less of a
ship’s battery of 24 guns? Or were they
bent on driving away or destroying a re-
cognised menace? Mr. Moorehead, like
others, is obviously not curious, having his
eyes riveted on the horizon and Cook, who
was presently to land on Tahiti with full
knowledge of what to expect there and of
how to conciliate the natives. More, he
had as second-in-command Lieutenant
Gore, who had been with Wallis and knew
Queen Oberea and the chieftains.
On the Australian side, Moorehead is
even more sketchy and unsatisfying than
on the Polynesian side. A narrative of
the penetration of the Australian con-
tinent which does not mention men like
Blaxland, Wentworth, Lawson, Oxley,
Sturt, Allan Cunningham Mitchell, and
Hamilton Hume is like Hamlet without
Hamlet, Polonius, and Ophelia. And a his-
torian of Australia who refers to the
appointment of “Captain Macquarie”
as Governor of New South Wales
knows little about his subject. Cull-
ing all his material from the parrot
historians, much of Mr. Moorehead’s
Australian history, especially his sum-
mary of Bligh’s connections with this
country, is “strictly for the birds.” And
even an emu could not digest with any
complacency his package description of
the aborigines written as if they were all
one typically, linguistically, and in habits,
customs, and colors. Moorehead’s sum-
mary of contacts between Europeans and
Australians and Maoris without mention of
Macquarie’s pioneer attempts to civilise
and educate the Australian native and
Marsden’s impact on the Maoris is cer-
tainly imperfect and very incomplete.
In the early part of the book there
is a sneer in his ink when he refers to
the tendency of Hawkesworth and Cook’s
artists to go “all Diderot and Bougainville”
in dressing up the Polynesian savage to
please the taste of the age of idyllic
romanticism, nymphs and shepherds, and
Watteau. But he himself, to a very large
extent, in treating the aboriginal does
much the same sort of thing in a nuclear
age context and idiom.
All this does not mean that Moorehead
is not charming to read or that his writ-
ing is not skilful and attractive. But his
book will form a more complete diet for
those in search of healthy knowledge. If
it is taken with suitable additives and an
occasional grain of salt. The knowledgeable
reader is apt at intervals as he reads to
parody the pregnant mutter that fell from
the lips of Marechal Bosquet as he
watched the Charge of the Light Brigade:
“C’est magnifique, mais ce n’est pas
d’historie.”

Mother
India
By KHUSHWANT SINGH
A Book of India. An anthology of prose and
poetry from the Indian Sub-Continent.
Edited by B. N. Pandey. Collins. $2.15.
Long Pilgrimage. The life and teaching of
Govindananda Bharati, known as the
Shivpuri Baba. J. G. Bennet. Hodder &
Stoughton. $3.85.
ANEW genre of reference book has
come into vogue, viz., information
about a country through a compre-
hensive selection of topics and quotations
to illustrate them. This is not mere
scissors-and-paste form of literature. It
demands judicious choice of subjects on the
part of the editor and enormous erudition
from the compiler of quotes. When the
anthology is meant to cover as vast a con-
tinent as India, with a written history which
goes back to 3000 8.C., a population of
over 450 million people of different racial
stock ranging from the Negroid aboriginal,
Mongloid, and Dravidian to Semitic and
Aryan, who worship a plethora of gods
and messiahs, speak more than 800 distinct
languages and dialects —the task becomes
formidable indeed. Dr. B. N. Pandey, who
is a lecturer at the School of Oriental and
African studies in London, has crammed
in as much as anyone could have on India
in less than 400 pages.
Dr. Pandey’s compilation is open to
criticism on some points which both he
and his publishers would do well to bear in
mind if and when they produce another
edition.
Rudyard Kipling is represented by two
miserable poems, neither of which deal
with the theme of the British Raj or jungle
life—the two subjects on which he excelled.
Similarly, when it comes to describing the
landscape, no one has bettered Edward
Thompson in his “Indian Day”; or Verier
Elwin in describing aboriginal life in its
aboriginal setting. Missing from the his-
torical section is the country’s most original
thinker of recent years, the late Sardar
K. M. Pannikkar, and on historical-cum-
contemporary affairs the provocative
Nirad C. Chaudhuri, whose “Autobiog-
raphy of an Unknown Indian” is generally
accepted as the most beautiful portrayal
of middle-class life in Bengal, as well as
the most powerful indictment of modern
India by a modern Indian.
Ramakrishna used to say that the real
message of the Gita could be grasped by
simply repeating the word “Gita” many
times. After a while the litany would sound
like “tagi, tagi, tagi”—meaning renuncia-
tion. There can, however, be degrees of
renunciation, ranging from vanaprastha—
taking to the woods—to giving up some
habit such as drinking tea. What the Gita
lauds more than anything else is action
without desire for its fruit; its hero is the
karmayogi —the man who discharges his
obligations to the society in which he lives
without any thought of the reward he
might reap. It is therefore somewhat
baffling to find that the most ardent propa-
gators of the gospel of the Gita flee the
cities and spend their lives meditating in
Himalayan caves. The most celebrated of
these ascetics was Govindananda. If his
own account of his life is to be believed—
Mr. Bennet does not doubt it—Govinda-
nanda was born in a Brahmin family in
Malabar, took on the robes of an ascetic
at the age of 12, travelled to Europe, and
then over North and South America, New
Zealand, and Australia—all on foot. In
these 40 years of globe-trotting he claimed
to have met many celebrities, among them
Queen Victoria (there is no reference to
the Swami’s visits in the Queen’s diaries)
and Theodore Roosevelt. Govindananda
retired to a hermitage in Nepal, near
Shivpuri, and thereafter came to be known
as the old man of Shivpuri. He lived a
long age, dying in 1963 in his 137th year.
There is little doubt that Shivpuri Baba
was a good man with considerable charis-
matic charm. Some of this personal mag-
netism comes through Mr. Bennet’s narra-
tive. But not even Mr. Bennet can claim
originality for anything the Baba taught.


BUSINESS AND FINANCE
Capital Solution
THE problem of foreign domination of Australia’s natural
resources developments has been solved. The Federal
Government, by following a consistent policy of inactivity,
has enabled the problem to solve itself.
How can there be a fear of foreign capital when there is none
available, anyway? So there is no need for the Government to
work out where it stands, what it believes, what is in the national
interest—at least for the time being. And when the question
comes up again, there is always the chance that it might once
more solve itself, thus avoiding the need for developing a sen-
sible, thought-out policy. In any event, now that our biggest
bank and our biggest life assurance office have both agreed
that our natural resources should remain in predominantly
Australian hands, with a bit more luck the institutions may
come up with the answer.
With such a policy to guide their investment decisions, the
role of the Bank of N.S.W. and the AMP Society is presumably
•to be a far greater one in future in financing development of
Australian natural resources. The AMP Society, which is at
present considering other proposals for investment in develop-
ment, will no doubt be adding to what are still only relatively
modest existing interests in bauxite at Gove, natural gas pipe-
lines, and pastoral pursuits. And the same goes for the Bank
of N.S.W.
But it takes more than masterly inactivity by the Government
and brave words from the chairmen of the AMP and Wales
boards to solve such basic problems. It takes money. The
simple question of where this money is to come from has still
to be satisfactorily answered. Certainly, the banks and life
offices could divert some of their funds away from office blocks
and city properties without doing much damage either to their
earning rates or to the best interests of their policyholders or
investors. Yet this will not go anywhere near providing the
complete answer. And now that the flow of foreign investment
is drying up (Cleveland Cliffs is reported to be having difficulty
finding overseas funds for its proposed iron ore pellet plant), we
may have to find an answer for quite different reasons. We
will have to find the money not simply to maintain our equity
in these projects, but to do so to enable them to proceed at all.
The current hiatus in some W.A. iron ore developments shows
this all too clearly.
It is astounding that, in such a situation, the Federal Govern-
ment has not yet been able to determine a policy, a plan of
action, or even a vague outline of one. Apart from some
fatuous comments about the obvious need for foreign capital here,
the Government’s only contribution to one of the most important
economic debates in recent times has been to reject the pro-
position of a $250 million National Investment Corporation
because it would involve an effective Government guarantee of
the capital put up. The big problem is not that the money
is not available here; it is in mobilising and directing it into
the sectors of the economy that most need it. The huge sums
of money in savings banks, life offices, and superannuation funds
(representing a high level of domestic saving, even if some of it
is involuntary) could incontestably be applied in greater degree in
national development projects.
There are many methods of direction—ranging from encourage-
ment, to incentive, to straight-out control —that are compatible
with a “free enterprise” economy. Some of these proposals have
been mentioned here before, such as the Dr. Coombs-Mr.
Scambler National Investment Corporation approach, the use
of the SRD machinery for diverting cash into specific sectors,
MEN AND MATTERS
BAD times for the broking business
have brought on probably the most
serious “brain drain” in its post-war
history. Not only are top men leaving
the industry, but broking firms are merg-
ing or splitting up, the price of seats has
collapsed, and many broking houses which
expanded rapidly during the boom years
are now barely able to make a profit
or are incurring losses.
Last week, Mr. W. K. Olver, the former
“heir apparent” at leading Melbourne
broking house J. B. Were and Co., re-
tired from the partnership to “give more
attention to his outside interests.” Mr.
Olver’s departure now leaves Mr. J.
Campbell Johnston as the man most likely
to succeed septuagenarian Mr. Staniforth
Ricketson as senior partner at J. B. Were,
particularly as Mr. Ricketson’s three
broker sons have moved to other firms
one to Sydney.
MR. OLVER’S move followed the re-
tirement of Mr. R. P. Dalziel from
the go-ahead Melbourne firm _of
Davies and Dalziel, which had established
a name for itself by the quality of its re-
search, and came after news that another
well-known and respected Melbourne
broker, Mr. L. J. Day, is also leaving the
industry.'
In Sydney, the same trend is evident.
Last week the Sydney office of Brisbane
broking house Wil-
son and Co. closed
its doors. This had
more significance
than the earlier
closure of fellow
Brisbane broker
Robin Corrie‘s Syd-
ney office, for Wil-
son’s two Sydney
men (Lin Kingston
and Dr. Tony Parks)
were research men rather than salesmen
(much of their work seemed to be over
the heads of some institutional clients) and
both are now leaving the industry.
THESE retirements follow last year’s
departure by Mr. J. D Wolfensohn,
the former partner in leading Syd-
ney broking house Ord, Minnett, T. J.
Thompson & Partners, into the merchant
banking business, where he is a joint
managing director of Darling and Co.
This brain drain is particularly serious
in view of suggestions that sections of the
industry are longer on heredity than on
ability.
Why are they leaving? The tempting
answer is that they prefer to go into other
fields rather than ride out the temporary
downturn in the industry that has brought
brokers’ profits down with a thud and the
price of stock exchange seats from as high
W. K. Olver
R. F. Arthur
J. D. Wolfensohn
as $34,500 in Sydney to $24,000, and in
Melbourne from $25,000 to only $16,000.
But the facts suggest they are leaving
because they consider the industry will
never recover the boom conditions of the
late 1950 s and that there is far greater
scope for progress outside it.
More than $3 million has been chopped
off the value of stock exchange seats in
Sydney and Melbourne alone in the past
year or so and the trend is still down-
wards.
How long can the small firms survive?
The trend to mergers continues, with two
old established Sydney firms, Leslie D.
Phillips and Kitchen and Flecknoe and
Osborne understood to be about to get
together. Yet one member of the Sydney
Stock Exchange is trying to disprove the
case against the small broker. Mr. R. F.
Arthur, who was in partnership with
Messrs J. and W. J. Anschau, last week
set up on his own account.


and an extension of the taxation benefits of the 30/20 legislation
to cover institutional investment in approved projects.
Last week the general manager of the Bank of N.S.W., Mr.
R. W. Norman, added another incentive —the negative one of
introducing a sliding tax scale based on a company’s Australian
content. And the “Financial Review” called for the Government
to give at least a “guidelines” lead.
There is a growing awareness in the business community of
the need for action, as evidenced by Mr. Norman’s very sober
comments: “Vital as it is for Australia’s future that capital and
know-how be imported to develop our natural resources, it is
also important that we do not let our birthright pass from
us to such an extent that even the policies of democratically
elected and endorsed governments can be overridden by power-
ful overseas industrial empires. These, by virtue of their owner-
ship of key sectors of our economy, could effectively negate
valid political decision affecting the whole electorate.”
These proposals are worthy of discussion. It is ridiculous
to dismiss the NIC idea (as the Government has done) without
exploring variations of the sort of guarantee involved. It seems
likely, for instance, that, instead of a huge commitment to
guarantee the capital invested in a natural development, it would
be much more realistic (and less expensive) to guarantee a
minimum return on it for a specific period, especially when
the developments related to wasting assets. It is unreal to
dismiss the suggestion that the SRD machinery be used to
direct funds from one sector to another on the grounds that
the machinery must be used only as a monetary tool to combat
inflation. The simple facts are that immense sums of cash could
be mobilised through this device for redistribution into specific
areas without interrupting the monetary policy uses of SRDs
in any way. What other method of redirecting funds from one
private sector to another private sector already exists?
And the proposal that the Federal Government should allow
institutions to invest part of their funds in approved projects
rather than entirely in government securities within the frame-
work of the 30/20 rule has the added advantage of forcing
the Government to look elsewhere for part of its loan money, to
bear part of the burden of raising cash overseas that it has forced
on so many projects by its conscious policy of forcing large
subscriptions to its loans from tied lenders and by keeping official
interest rates high.
All these suggestions are positive methods of coping with the
problem. Some evidence that the Government was, at least,
thinking seriously about them (even if it preferred to do nothing)
would be welcome. A well-argued case against any one of
them has not yet come out of Canberra.
Shipping Choices
THE two big Italian passenger shipping lines servicing Aus-
tralia the Flotta Lauro and the Lloyd Triestino
have come up with entirely different answers to the re-
equipment problem. The Lloyd Triestino line introduced the
ultra-modern Galileo and Marconi; the Flotta Lauro pre-
ferred to rebuild two old Dutch ships, the 19-year-old Willem
Ruys and the 29-year-old Oranje, both of which had been
on the Australian run under the Royal Interocean Line flag.
Rebuilding the two ships from the hull and engines up
(making them among the most automated ships afloat) cost
$2O million each. Despite the developments in ship styling
and engineering in the past 25 years, the Flotta Lauro decision
has some solid merits over building two spanking new ones.
The main reason was the saving of about $4 million on
each vessel. Perhaps more importantly, the refit took only
two years, whereas to build anew, even in Italian shipyards,
the fastest in Europe, would take five years.
Now called the Achille Lauro (23,000 tons) and Angelina
Lauro (21,000 tons), the two ships replace the Roma and
Sydney, of less than 15,000 tons apiece, and provide a regular
Tasman service as an extension of the Europe-Australia run.
The rebuilding was not without its problems; both ships
suffered severe fire damage within a few days last August,
as if keeping up some sort of tradition with former Royal
Interocean liners. The oldest of the Royal Interocean fleet
to ply Australian waters, the J.V.0., was bought by the Greek
Line, rechristened Lakonia and sank in the Atlantic after a
fire in December, 1963.
THE WEEK BRIEFLY
For the economy: In its biggest overseas
loan operation ever, the Federal Government is to
borrow a further SU.S.IOO million from the United
States Government, bringing these Government-to-
Government raisings for defence to $450 million.
Wool sales for the ten months to April 30 realised
$A580.4 million, against $607 million for the correspond-
ing portion of the previous selling season; average prices
for greasy have moved up almost 10 cents a lb. and
Japan remains the chief buyer.
For the markets: After overcoming whatever
disillusionment they felt over the company scandals, tak-
ing notice of Wall Street’s gyrations and giving more
consideration to the British Budget, Australian share
markets managed a fairly healthy spurt at the end
of the week. The return of buying support could not
cancel all the first three days’ retreat, yet it spread
from the leaders to a host of second-line issues.
Buyers’ return has dragged London forward too; even
the institutions are evident. A sorting-out of industrials
from services stocks continues, while more North Sea
gas encourages optimism ... Wall Street has reached
the year’s lowest level, struggling with the impact of
Detroit’s production cuts and actual lower car sales
so far in May.
For companies: The Victorian Government is
considering whether it can take legal action following
Mr. Peter Murphy’s report on the Korman group .'. .
Six former directors of H. G. Palmer (Consolidated)
have been summonsed for alleged breaches of the Crimes
Act in connection with a debenture prospectus.
Holeproof Industries, New Zealand, the major asset
of Factors Ltd., is not now to be sold . . . Earnings
of MLC Ltd. dropped by $241,000 to $1,150,142 in
1965-66, just about the amount of the previous year’s
H. G. Palmer dividend.
A record profit, up by 3.4 percent to $4,885,121,
enabled Tooth and Co. to put its dividend on a 16
percent annual rate, thus teasing shareholders about a
possible bonus issue . . . Carpet maker Minster removed
investors’ nagging doubts by assurances of an “adequately
covered” and unchanged 20 percent dividend . . .
“Very satisfactory” sales lifted the profits of Burns
Philip (South Sea) . . . Commonwealth Industrial
Gases looks forward to a steady 1965-66 result.
Myer Emporium, Australia’s largest department store
retailer, earned 3.9 percent less on 3.5 percent higher
sales in the January half-year . . . Sydney’s Mark
Foy’s suffered a loss on retailing activities for 11 months
to January; a profit came from tenanted areas.
Queensland southern-belt sugar producer Fairymead
lost $345,292 in 1965, cutting dividend from 12 to 6
percent . . . Woolbroker Younghusband saw profit slip
by 12 percent to $536,423 but held a 10 percent
dividend . . . Drought, plus a loss in a new sub-
sidiary, forced F. W. Williams’ 1965 profit back to
$75,903, following 1964’s $365,362, yet directors kept
the 10 percent dividend.
Western Titanium took every benefit from the mineral
sands boom, bringing profit up from $396,212 to a
peak $645,300; dividend will be announced later . . .
Associated Minerals, on the other hand, forecasts 25
percent lowef profit and an unchanged final payment
... A l-for-8 issue at 100 percent premium is announced
by Kathleen Investments, to raise $717,000 to develop
ilmenite deposits.
A $2.5 million solar salt works is planned by ICIANZ
near Port Alma, Queensland, under agreement with
Central Queensland Salt Industries.

Getting with the Strength
Whither the flow of capital?
By CROESUS
SPEAKING broadly, what Mr. K. W. Halkerston, a partner in lan Potter & Co.,
seemed to be saying to the forum of the Victorian Branch of the Economic Society
last week was that increasing discernment of risks has been shown by the various
classes of capital available to the Australian economy in recent years. As it were, a
sort of “get with the strength” psychology has developed.
The immediate point stressed was that,
largely as a result of the experience fol-
lowing the 1960-61 boom, underwriters
had become increasingly wary of support-
ing for public listing small and medium-
sized concerns whose names were little
known to the« public, even though the
companies themselves were sound and with
good prospects. The other side of the
coin was that well-known listed companies
were able to command and even hoard
the lion’s share of available funds in the
capital market where, like the general
public, the institutions had also adopted
an increasingly selective attitude in be-
coming more shy of the security offered
by the smaller fry.
In an investment climate where, these
past few years, small investors have been
reluctant to try the weather, underwriters
have had to rely increasingly on the pro-
vision of institutional funds to fill new
issues. Mr. Halkerston pointed out that,
whereas in 1959-60 only 9 percent of the
money to fill debenture note issues had
come from life assurance and superannua-
tion funds, in the past two years these
sources had provided about 30 percent of
it.
In their approach to equity investment,
the institutions have also been looking
closer'at the risks involved. Sir Maurice
Mawby has painfully discovered this in his
local search for money for mining ventures.
The institutions have eschewed such
modern ideas as lending on the security
of cash flows as opposed to physical assets
of mining companies and they have gener-
ally been looking for earlier and higher
returns on their money than anybody
except Mr. Callaghan perhaps might
reasonably expect from this sort of invest-
ment.
It is no use pointing the bone at any-
body for this. If small investors have had
their fingers burned by glowing prospec-
tuses of a few years back and now want
only the big names rather than the
promise of big returns, so also, more than
ever, the institutions don’t relish the idea
of sinking their funds in distant horizons
any more than that of dabbling in high
yielding mortgages in doubtfully secure
smallish businesses. There’s a long un-
happy trail still a-windin’ there, particu-
larly for the more adventurous finance
companies. In a word, the going relation-
ship between rates and risks gets closer
every day.
So, at the extreme, people don’t want
white elephants any more. _Nor do bank
depositors want much of their money
locked up by the banks in long-term ven-
tures, even those with high-sounding
national tags on them. Equally, small
savers opt for safe and not so highly
rewarding havens for their capital (re-
member 1959, when 10 percent deposits
were first offered by H. G. Palmer and
a flood went out of the savings banks into
them).
Mr. Halkerston, therefore, leads us to
a big question: who is going to fertilise
the smaller and medium-sized firms with
the additional capital they need to fill the
so-called “Macmillan Gap”? And then
on to the further, even bigger one: who
in Australia is going to grasp the nettle
of maximising local capital provision for
the new mining industries?
It is easier to ask these questions than
to answer them. We have first to face the
task of increasing savings in this country
and this is not going to be an easy one.
We are such avid consumers and, in the
period ahead, the writing looks clear on
the wall for another self-induced increase
in national spending via a further rise in
the award wages. We cannot have our
cake (for capital investment purposes)
and eat it, too. I haven’t heard anybody
saying that, as Britain insists on turning off
her traditional flow of capital to us, then
we will have to save more ourselves to
fill the gap.
Narrowing down the problem to the
capital market, in the case of the under-
writers one would like to see a little
more enterprise on their side in recog-
nising the claims of the smaller and
medium-sized firms for new capital and
a little less insistence on their part in
going for the big companies. I know
altruism, even of the national variety, is
probably none of their business, but it
would be better for them to do a little
judicious steering of capital to where it

is most nationally wanted than, say, to
have capital issues control to tell them
what can be underwritten.
One would imagine, however, that the
underwriters will be in an increasing
dilemma about what issues to underwrite
in the near future and, if anything, it looks
as if the small and medium-sized locally
owned concerns could be in for even less
generous treatment at their hands. This
is because, with the tap of U.K. capital
turned off, British firms may be expected
to try to raise an increasing proportion of
their new capital needs on the Australian
market. Given the limited availability of
supplies, it will be difficult to accom-
modate them without further retracting the
supply to already hungry locally owned
companies.
The capital problems of small and
even medium-sized businesses have always
been an obstacle to expansion in Austra-
lia. It is somewhat galling to find that
many such firms which have broken out
of private company to public status now
find themselves so far down the under-
writers’ queues.
JJOWEVER, while it is true that under-
writers at the apex of the structure of
private finance may have the last word
about new issues and floats, things have not
been standing still in the provision of
finance for small and medium-sized firms
in the general body of the structure. The
extension of term lending by the bank
attests progress in this area and the estab-
lishment of the proposed National Invest-
ment Corporation would be a further step
forward.
Now that the banks are moving more
rapidly in the provision of term lending to
smaller firms, what seems to be most needed
is an extension of the facilities for infusing
equity capital into such businesses. “I have
been urging for 15 years that more facilities
should be provided to enable smaller firms
to issue more equity capital,” Dr. R. F.
Henderson told the International Banking
School in Melbourne last year. But so far
little has been done.
Unfortunately we hear a lot less these
days of the activities of people like AUC
and DFC in nurturing smaller firms, which
in 1961 Sir lan Potter designated as, “be-
cause of their size are unable to avail them-
selves of the facilities of the open money
market or that require finance that does not
enter the scope of bank accommodation.”
Useful work is, of course, still being done,
say, by Australian United Development, as
AUC’s chairman pointed out in his address
last year.
Here then is important scope for the
proposed NIC, which in the first instance
might well take a look at the workings
of Britain’s Finance Corporation for Indus-
try, established in 1945 with capital sub-
scribed as to 40 percent by insurance com-
panies, 30 percent by investment trust com-
panies and 30 percent by the Bank of Eng-
land. As a matter of fact, though it has
done good work in nurturing firms in a
wide range of industries, including steel,
oil, chemicals, shipping, engineering and so
on, the FCI doesn’t seem to have made the
most of its opportunities. One would hope
that a NIC here would do very much
better.

Britain Won’t Join the EEC
“The most unlikely event of the decade”
By J. G. HARDY
THE question of British membership of the Common Market has become a live issue
again. Opinions differ widely whether the consequences of a United Kingdom
entry into the European Economic Community (EEC) would be less or more
hartnful for Australia than it was judged to be in 1983.
It is remarkable that nearly everybody
in Australia thinks Great Britain will ask
for and gain admission to this strange but
rather successful economic bloc. This
attitude seems to have developed from the
uncomfortable knowledge that membership
would be of considerable economic advan-
tage to Great Britain, but it disregards
completely the proposition that Britain’s
chances of effecting an entrance are much
dimmer today than three years ago. Or,
expressed more bluntly, close to nil.
The complex topic of Britain’s belated
participation in a Continental grouping
cannot be understood without some know-
ledge of the EEC itself and the questions
left unanswered when the first negotiations
came to an end.
Little attention has been given to the
fundamental reasons which brought six
countries with five different languages,
clashing histories, and well-established hates
and fears into a voluntary combination
closer than anything achieved in the past
under more accommodating circumstances.
The very simple explanation is to be found
in the fear of the Eastern European States,
which seem to promise great economic
advantages from their monolithic struc-
ture. It is simply good luck that the new
bloc the EEC started was at a time of
world boom and that it was as successful as
its feared Eastern European rival bloc was
unsuccessful.
This had, in fact, two consequences. It
removed some of the pressure which
brought and bound the Six together, so
that every now and then a crisis was
allowed to develop—by no means all of
them caused by General de Gaulle.
Secondly, it left the Governments and the
people of the Six a little red-faced for
having misjudged their adversaries so
badly. This vexation is reinforced by a
vague feeling that the premiums for an
unnecessary insurance policy were possibly
too high.
It does not follow that the disappearance
of one threat would make the EEC un-
necessary. It, after all, has conferred con-
siderable economic advantages to the
partners, although nobody can actually
express the gains in francs, guilders, or
marks. It only means that the member
with the greatest vested interest in the
combination had to produce another threat
as potent as the last one.
And this is exactly what happened. No-
body, but absolutely nobody, draws greater
benefits, in general and in hard cash, from
the EEC than France. For this reason de
Gaulle had to build up America as the
octopus ready to swallow Europe—‘indus-
try, trade, and soul. A good number of
American firms and quite a few American
tourists and businessmen assisted de Gaulle
in his task very handsomely.
“The Five” know that they cannot func-
'J'HE Common Market affair has
blown up once again. Sir Alex-
ander Downer, the Australian High
Commissioner in London, has re-
portedly “seriously embarrassed” the
Australian Government by warning
Britain of the consequences to her rela-
tions with Australia of joining the
Common Mai'ket. Next week the
Minister for Trade, Mr. McEwen, will
go to London for the Commonwealth
Trade Ministers’ Conference and will
discuss Britain’s renewed interest in
EEC membership.
This interest is real, with the recently
re-elected Wilson Labor Government
appointing two Ministers (one of them
Mr. George Brown, Mr. Wilson’s
deputy) to handle the matter. Last
week Mr. Brown said the question of
British entry was “not whether* we
should join but when and on what
terms.”
What are the prospects of Britain
succeeding now in the bid that failed
three years ago, and how is this a
threat to Australia? This article claims
there is no threat and that Britain will
not join Europe.
tion without France, because “The Four”
would feel too much under German
domination. They also realise that it
would be useless to invite Britain into
the breach, because no sane Minister in
London would allow the United King-
dom to commit such a mistake. It would
involve Britain in all the endless Con-
tinental squabbles, without the proper
tools to deal with them. By the same
token, France cannot leave the Six. Not
even de Gaulle could do this, because
public opinion would not allow it, neither
in France nor elsewhere. s But it goes
further. “The Five,” least of all Ger-
many, cannot afford to let France go,
assuming that she really wanted to leave,
for fear that de Gaulle would come to
an agreement with Russia. This might
sound involved in Australia, but is well
understood in Europe and nowhere better
than in West Germany.
BEFORE one can imagine Britain as a
member of the EEC it is necessary
to summarise the main points of the
Treaty of Rome. Contrary to public
opinion, economic integration is not the
only successful (and the acquisition of
“supranational” powers not the only
secondary) aspect. In memory or in
imitation of the Atlantic Charter, the pro-
gram of the EEC is directed toward free-
doms; more precisely toward a freedom
of movements. For goods, this is the
well-known lowering of tariff barriers; for
persons, it means the unrestricted choice
of domicile or place of work for any
national within the wider community; and,
finally, for money, it includes the free
transfer of capital and the right to com-
mercial and industrial establishment any-
where.
These principles are, for all practical
purposes, administered by the “Com-
mission” of eight members in Brussels,
commanding a staff of 2732 civil servants
and others, totalling 3115 persons. The

last “General Report on the Activities of
the Community” from April 1, 1964, to
March 31, 1965, contains 394 closely
printed pages which should make interest-
ing reading for all those who think that
Britain could find a profitable niche in the
EEC.
The Community has its own, well-staffed
Court, where cases of member States versus
member States or the Commission, or
private persons versus States or the Com-
mission, are decided. In 1965 there was
a case “EEC Commission v. Italy” and
a few months later one “Italy v. EEC Com-
mission.” Can anyone really see her
Majesty’s Government coming to terms
with such a set-up?
The European Parliament, another in-
strument of the EEC, stipulated the terms
in unequivocal language, saying that “. . .
an application for accession . . . un-
reservedly accepted the rules and objec-
tives of the Treaty of Rome.” It would
seem significant that the Europeans
thought it wise to mention “rules” ifi front
of “objectives.” The President of the
Community, Professor Hallstein, under-
lined this in his answer to Mr. Heath’s
statement that “the United Kingdom would
accept the principles of the Treaty” by
adding that “. . . adaptations to these
protocols must not be allowed to modify
the tenor and the spirit of the Treaty
and must essentially concern transitional
arrangements only.”
As everybody knows, the negotiations
dragged on and on until General de Gaulle
put an end to the agony. Statements issued
by all sorts of people, claiming then that
Britain had been within a few inches of
success, are unfortunately nonsense. The
Community published a sober report of
112 pages on these negotiations which has
never been contradicted, even on a single
sentence, by Britain. It shows how much
Mr. Heath had tried to gain for British
agriculture and the Commonwealth, but
it also proves that he was worlds away
from succeeding.
BRITISH requests for a distinction be-
tween “traditional suppliers” and third
countries are rejected as contrary to
the spirit of international trade agreements.
On the question of integration of British
agriculture the EEC was “. . . not willing
to extend ‘adjustment periods’ ” and in-
sisted on the abolition of deficiency pay-
ments and a system of regressive subsidies.
Equal pay for the sexes, special provisions
applied for on behalf of Northern Ireland
and labor questions, the difficulties of
“equalising” the different social systems
of the Continent with the Welfare State
in Britain, and hundreds of other ques-
tions “. . . had not been discussed seri-
ously.” Not to speak of the involved
complexities in connection with legal,
financial, and institutional problems.
The last thing to mention, because it
will hardly play a role in the future, is
Britain’s relationship with her partners in
British-sponsored EFTA. Even if the
United Kingdom can get rid of this prob-
lem by just dumping the other six States,
it will not enhance her image, already
badly dimmed by the introduction and
preservation of the “surcharge” on duties.
The label of “lack of solidarity” is no
recommendation for a body where soli-
darity must rate very highly.
And now the whole complex is on the
move again. The basis for all the talk,
apart from Britain’s desperate need to get
out of her economic stagnation, is narrow
indeed. The magnificent palace of cards
rests uneasily on a few cryptic sentences
uttered during election speeches by
General de Gaulle. His Foreign Minister,
Couve de Murville, was more specific
when he spoke of the possibility of
Britain’s entry “without reserve” and (that
means “in addition to”) “after meeting
necessary conditions.” Britain’s Foreign
Secretary, Michael Stewart, put Britain’s
case also in precise words: “We have been
and are willing to negotiate an entry into
the EEC provided we are granted the
right conditions, as far as the essential
interests of the United Kingdom, EFTA,
and the Commonwealth are safeguarded.”
In spite of all the pious speeches in the
other countries, the enthusiasm for
Britain’s entry is not very great. Any
“encouragement” from France, given at
a time when de Gaulle was at loggerheads
with his partners, must automatically
make the others suspicious. Those who
still harbor some hope for a political
integration would only burden themselves
with two instead of one vote “against.”
Other more specific questions raise their
. heads all over the place. Germany is so
preoccupied with her unification problem
that she has little reason to support a

up on the assumption that they will have
the EEC market to themselves.
Returning to more basic questions, it
is open to doubt whether the Community
really wants, needs, or even can afford
a further “diversification.” There are many
influential voices who warn that after the
“association” with Greece, the African
States, and Madagascar, a further dilution
would defeat all its purposes. The nego-
tiations with Austria are far from en-
couraging for prospective members, and
poor Israel could tell a more woeful story.
Before the British election it has been
said that an entry of the United King-
dom could only be brought about by a
strong government in London. Now Mr.
Wilson has his comfortable majority, the
argument can be turned the other way.
The Government of France seems reason-
ably stable as long as the General is alive,
in spite of the coming elections toward the
end of the year. In Germany, too, con-
ditions can be called safe, although not
quite as easy as most Australians think.
The difficulties under which the ruling
bodies in Italy and Belgium are formed
and kept in office have become proverbial.
The Netherlands is standing somewhere
in the centre. Not one of these govern-
ments is as safe as the present Ministry in
Britain (and nowhere near as untroubled
as the men in Canberra).
TWO other issues standing in the path of
Britain must be mentioned. Can the
United Kingdom in the present
economic situation afford to load the
budget of every family by eight or ten
shillings sterling a week, because that
seems to be the cost of accepting the agri-
cultural policy of the EEC. Secondly, what
will happen to sterling under the “rules ?ind
objectives” of the Treaty of Rome if any
defence measure the Chancellor of the
Exchequer deems necessary will have to be
approved in Brussels first? It is true that
Germany and Holland appreciated their
currencies without asking prior permission,
but the EEC has learned a lesson from this
manoeuvre which, apart from everything
else, was appreciated by the other partners.
Time is not on the side of Britain, be-
cause the interweaving of interests and
forces within the EEC has never ceased
and is gaining momentum again. Finally,
Russia’s interests must not be overlooked.
An EEC with Britain would be about
the last thing the Kremlin wants and
quite a small carrot from Moscow could
quickly produce a “de facto veto” by a
country other than France.
There are many other reasons on both
sides which are tending to make an ad-
mission of Britain into the EEC the most
unlikely event of the decade. This does
not mean that it could not happen at
all. It has been suggested in Europe
that the pressure from the economic situa-
tion in Great Britain might become so
great that an entry will be requested
at any price, on the understanding that
“adjustments” and “safeguards” are dis-
cussed afterwards. This would be a risky
and expensive procedure, but it might
appear under desperate circumstances the
only possible solution. Then, but only
then, Australia will have reason to fear
the EEC.

Buying on Lower Profits
MARKET POINTERS • SECURITY ANALYSIS • COMMODITIES
MINING • SHARE LIST • BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
By JASON
THERE is a pretty good portfolio that
could be built up quite cheaply out
of the impressive list of companies
reporting lower profits last week. It
might be a cantankerous way to go about
buying shares, but in the long haul people
who buy on bad news would probably be
making more money than those who do so
on good.
Not that lower profits are an automatic
recommendation; no one could recom-
mend investment in A. G. Healing, at
least until its directors (those who are
still on the board) make up their minds
about what the words “net profit” mean.
And it would take a brave man to urge
anyone to buy Mark Foys shares when
even the good retailers like Myers are
finding things tough.
But there seem plenty of good reasons
for thinking about buying shares in Fairy-
mead Sugar, Associated Minerals, CIG
(although there are some provisos about
that one), Myers, Younghusband, MLG,
and even F. W. Williams. Yet all came
out with something sad last week.
There are plenty of other companies
whose news of lower profits so far this
year is providing excellent opportunities
for buying, one of them being Minster
(which last week wisely allayed the
market’s fears by forecasting that ordinary
dividend would be held at an “adequately
covered” 20 percent) and another being
the Melbourne tin smelting company O.
T. Lempriere.
The market seems to have taken the
Lempriere interim report of lower profits
through lower tin prices far too seriously,
especially in view of the prospects of
much increased throughput from the mas-
sive Renison deposits. It has also mis-
understood the implications of the bene-
ficiating plant at Renison; this will not
act in competition with Lemprieres but,
on the contrary, will upgrade the material
that goes to the smelter, so increasing the
volume that can be put through and
lowering the costs.
BUT there is no point in adopting
the “buy on bad news” approach
unless there is a good prospect that
things will improve. With the A. G. Healing
group such a proposition would be difficult
to establish.
The company now appears to be having
difficulty not only in earning adequate
profits (it is now earning at an annual
rate of 3.1 percent on capital) but in
conveying to its shareholders the exact
state of its business fortunes. Last year
at about this time it announced that its
profit for the 1964-65 year should be
around the same level as the 16£ percent
of the previous year, that trading was
continuing strongly, and that it was in-
viting noteholders in its subsidiary A. E.
Goodwin to convert into parent company
notes.
It then passed its ordinary dividend
but only “to maintain firm control of
liquidity,” and later announced a higher
profit and cut its dividend by a third for
the full year, forecasting that liquidity
would improve in March.
Now it will be June. But it is no
longer liquidity that seems the main
trouble, it is profits. The departure from
the board of two A. E. Goodwin direc-
tors (Sir Robert Webster and Mr. A. S.
Hawley) earlier this month could have
indicated that last December’s settlement
of a disagreement with the Healing family
has left some tensions between the two
sections of the company.
In the latest report it appears that
Goodwin’s engineering is doing better
than Healing’s appliances.
It was the “disquieting newspaper
reports which appear to have arisen from
the resignation of two directors for strictly
personal reasons” that inspired A. G.
Healing to release a detailed interim report
to the Stock Exchange ten days ago.
This announced a profit slump from
$531,000 to $246,000 during the December
six months. Even more “disquieting” news
than the newspaper reports was in the
actual profit figures when they eventually
came out last week.
The recent figures are shown to have
been wrong; “net profit” meant profit
before tax to Healing directors rather than
after it. So after deducting tax it is evident
that the profit fall was really 75 percent,
and no mention is made of a dividend.
Directors now say sales will show some
improvement and certain technical dif-
ficulties which hampered operations in
appliances in the first half have since
been ironed out. In addition, interest
bills will have been reduced by the
redemption of $2.4 million in debentures
during December and March last. It
was these redemptions which caused the
present liquidity problem, rather than
the heavy drop in profits. But this could
be one case where it might pay to wait
and find out.
ONE company which could stand to
gain from the increasing trend to-
ward pellitisations of iron ore is

to prospect for bentouite in an area about
65 miles southwest of Springsure in
Queensland. High-grade bentonite is an
industrial clay used as a bonding agent
for foundry purposes, including the pelli-
tisation of iron ore. Although low grade
bentonite is produced in Western Aus-
tralia and Queensland, almost all bento-
nite required for foundry purposes has to
be imported.
In 1965, imports, which came almost
entirely from the U.S.A., totalled 14,000
tons, valued at about $A850,000. It is
estimated that 5000 to 6000 tons of bento-
nite are required to pellitise one million
tons of iron ore or iron concentrates, so
on present contracts the quantity of bento-
nite required for pellitising could exceed
25,000 tons annually. Bentonite is also
being increasingly used in oil well drilling.
Although Uranium Consolidated has
not yet tested its area, reports issued last
year by the Bureau of Mineral Resources
indicating outcrops of superior bentonite
clay are encouraging.
ANOTHER company which could ulti-
mately benefit from the increasing
development of pelletisation plants
is Ampol Exploration Ltd., which has a
one-seventh interest in Wapet’s Barrow
Island field, a potential source of power
for these plants. An announcement on the
commercial potential of the field is ex-
pected to be made at the end of May,
when a meeting of representatives of the
participating companies in Wapet will be
held in Perth.
NEW' Guinea Goldfields’ pro-
duction is up about 25 percent so
far in the current year, so a lift in
profits seems likely. Last year’s result rose
from $244,000 to $306,000, giving double
cover to the steady 9-1- percent dividend. A
higher dividend could be paid this year
simply by distributing 4 cents a share in-
stead of the equivalent of the previous 4d.
If such was the case the shares would
yield, on current prices, 9| percent tax
free. At present they are yielding 7J per-
cent tax free. This would leave room for
a price increase, especially as the group
is not wholly dependent on that now rela-
tively unglamorous mineral. More than
half its profits come from sawmilling,
transport, and coffee plantations.
JUTE and sisal manufacturers may find
themselves facing competition from
another source in the near future. A
Waterloo (N.S.W.) company, Synthetic
Yarns Pty. Ltd., is currently installing
specialised machinery to produce a plastic
yarn. The new yam is said to be rot-
proof and have high strength. It is ex-
truded and flat, major applications being
in the field of baler twines and woven
fabrics for bags and bales.
As rope or twine, it will also find mar-
kets in industry generally, retailing, and
other places where packaging goes on.
Synthetic Yarns is already a supplier to
the weaving, rope, and cordage industries
with its existing products, so it has one
foot in the correct door.

BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
Newton McLaren's
Earning Rate
THE signs look ominous. The latest
accounts of Adelaide electrical
engineer and merchant Newton
McLaren Investments Ltd. was not a
cheering document, despite the welcome
inclusion of some vital provisions for the
first time.
At the December 31 balance-date, the
company lost its Hoover franchise (when
Hoover took over its own distribution in
all States) which had been an important
contributor to company profits. “It will
take time to develop replacement busi-
ness,” the directors reported with the
accounts —but without stating how much
the franchise had contributed. Share-
holders only know that there is still a link
with Hoover, as a service agent supplying
spare parts and repairs, and that directors
hope to maintain the percent dividend
rate.
Yet it is clear that the 30 percent earn-
ing rate (lowest since 1962) will suffer
this year. This may not only be a result
of the Hoover franchise departure, although
some indication of the importance of
Hoover is given in the fact that last year’s
17 percent fall in pre-tax profit was due
in the main to a fall in Hoover sales.
This appears to have happened quite
late in the year.
The extent of the Hoover impact on
other figures in the accounts is probably
not so great; the fall in work in progress
from $235,000 to $167,000 probably relates
more to the engineering section, which also
suffered a reduction in profit margins last
year that affected the group profit.
It hardly seems likely that the Hoover
changeover had much impact on the stock
figure, which rose from $316,000 to
$367,000 (especially as Hoover made
special provisions to write down the stock
in distributors’ hands at the time of the
takeover). When this figure is joined
with the increase in debtors from
$1,027,000 to $1,189,000, despite an evident
slowing down in the business, it is clear
that there have been other changes in the
accounts than those brought by Hoover.
Provided its remaining business keeps
up, it appears that the company will earn
enough to maintain its dividend, which at
present gives a yield of 6 percent on
current prices—and 16.3 percent on earn-
ings. But it will be a long time before its
earning rate gets back to last year’s levels
—and before its bonus issue hopes are
restored.

Point Charts and Their Use
A good measure of share activity
By GERALD LAURANCE
THE “point” chart is a statistical de-
vice that has no time scale. It
simply charts the movement of a
share price and the element of time comes
in purely as a sideline due to the fact
that price movements take time to happen.
This type of chart is very useful in
showing the activity in a share. No mark
is made on the chart unless the price
moves up or down a predetermined dis-
tance.. This distance may be the value
of the customary market bid for the share
—a point, or half this value (a half-point),
or two or three times the value of the
customary bid (a three-point chart).
Should there be no change in price
the chart would remain unaltered, even
though a month or more may have
elapsed. Should the price keep rising with-
out falling back by the value of the
point, the chart would show a vertical
movement.
While a point chart must also be ad-
justed for cash and bonus issues, etc.,
the lack of a time scale means that
there is little point in using a propor-
tional scale for the price axis, as is
necessary in the bar chart. This allows
the use of ordinary squared graph paper.
Nor is turnover of much assistance in this
type of chart.
The actual plotting of a point chart
is fairly simple. A mark is made in the
initial square for the first price; then a
mark in the square above (or below) for
the next time the price rises (or falls) by
the point selected. A further rise requires
a mark in the next square above and so
on. Then if the price falls by the selected
point, a mark is made in the adjacent
column.
Every time there is a change in direc-
tion of the price it becomes necessary to
move to the adjacent column. This prin-
ciple remains the same in the several
variants of point charts. Some chartists
prefer to mark rising squares with crosses
and falling squares with noughts. Time
can be shown by indicating the beginning
of each week and month as desired.
The point chart may reflect patterns
which occur in bar charts, but this is not
necessarily so. In most cases the patterns
which are similar are readily noticed, par-
ticularly the “head and shoulders” and
“double bottoms” patterns. But point
charts show their own patterns as well.
Among these are “congestion” patterns,
which are used by chartists to predict the
likely extent of any price movements, al-
though they are of little use in attempting
to forecast the direction of the move-
ment.
'JHE “ three point” chart is often used
in such a way as to indicate the likely
short-term direction of price movement
by indicating points of resistance or sup-
port. Thus, if a share moves above a
resistance level by a certain amount (e.g.,
three points) it may be possible to say
that it will continue to move in the same
direction.
Although trend lines can be drawn on
point charts, their validity is somewhat
limited by the lack of a time axis as
well as the distortion which occurs due
to the use of an ordinary price scale in-
stead of the proportional scale used in
the bar charts. Nevertheless, a trend line
may prove useful, especially if a bar chart
is not available. Trend lines are simply
lines linking the lower points of price rises
or the upper points of falling prices,
whichever is appropriate.

MINING
Western Mining’s Nickel
New venture could, double group profits
ALTHOUGH only a small section of
the potential nickel-bearing area at
Kambalda has been tested, the en-
couraging results have enabled Western
Mining Corporation Ltd. to make a de-
finite decision to commence production
of nickel sulphide concentrates before the
end of 1967. Costs of bringing the venture
into production will be about $3 million,
to be financed initially from short-term
borrowings with a new share issue being
contemplated at a later date.
Early estimates indicate that when
anticipated production rates are achieved,
the new venture could more than double
present group profits available to WMC
shareholders.
On results of intersections to date, it
seems possible that the grade of the ore-
body could average about 3 percent nickel
against the figure of 1 percent which is
considered economic in other lode deposits
around the world. The company antici-
pates treating about 8000 tons of ore each
month when the mill is operating to
capacity—in other words, almost 100,000
tons annually, from which 3000 tons of
contained nickel should result.
If it is assumed that the deposits are
pentlandite —the most common form of
nickel sulphides containing about 36 per-
cent nickel—the actual quantity of nickel
sulphide concentrates produced will be
about 8000 tons each year. The existence
of any other economic minerals in the
orebody, such as copper or platinum,
would further enhance its prospects.
At this stage it can only be guesswork
as to how this production can be sold.
At present there are no facilities for smelt-
ing nickel concentrates in Australia. Talk
of establishment of a smelter at Kal-
goorlie, or possibly Kwinana, seems some-
what premature. Also it would not be
economic to transport concentrates to the
Blackstone Ranges over 400 miles to the
north-east, where International Nickel Co.,
of Canada, is reported to be considering
the establishment of a smelter.
In view of these factors, the most likely
market currently available is considered
to be North America, which has over 80
percent of the non-Communist world’s
nickel capacity of around 350-360,000
short tons. It is significant that, although
U.S. nickel capacity is small by Canadian
standards, the most important U.S. pro-
ducer is Hanna Mining Co., of Ohio,
which has a 25 percent interest in Wes-
tern Mining Corporation’s iron ore
export venture. Japan, with a current
nickel capacity of 30,000 tons from im-
ported ores, could also be a likely market,
with the added advantage of cheaper
freight costs.
Although a price for nickel sulphide
concentrates would probably have to be
negotiated, a fair price for concentrates
delivered to North America could be
around SAIIOO per ton of contained nickel.
On this basis, total annual revenue from
the Kambalda venture would be $3.3
million. Costs of mining, treatment, and
recovery of concentrates, administration,
development, and amortisation could be
in the order of $lO per ton of ore pro-
duced, or $1,000,000 p.a., while freight
costs from the mill to North America
could be about $22 per ton of concentrates
produced bringing total annual costs
of production to about $1.2 million.
On the above assumptions, the pre-tax
profit from this venture would be about
$1.2 million each year. A tax exemption
of 20 percent of net income from produc-
tion of nickel will be available. So, even
disregarding other deductions allowable to
mining companies, the after-tax profit
should be around $BOO,OOO compared with
.a total group net profit of $1,207,000 in
1964/65 (of this $668,000 was outside
shareholders’ interests, leaving $639,000
available to WMC shareholders; prelimin-
ary figures for the year to March 31, 1966,
should be available in June).
After June 30, 1967, when the com-
pany’s deferred shares will rank for
dividend, a total of $737,000 will be re-
quired to maintain the existing 20 percent
dividend rate currently paid out of tax-
free gold earnings. It seems that, even
if the company’s capital were doubled, it
could maintain the existing dividend rate,
with a decreased tax-exempt content,
especially in view of anticipated earnings
from iron ore exports and the 20 percent
interest in Alcoa.
Gold Earnings
CURRENTLY almost all of Western
Mining Corporation’s profits are by
way of dividends from its 31.7 per-
cent interest in Gold Mines of Kalgoorlie
(Aust.) Ltd. and its 50.48 percent in-
terest in Central Norseman Gold Corpora-
tion N.L. (by far its greatest income
earner). These two companies ranked
second and third in the list of major
Australian gold producers last year. Al-
though preliminary results for both com-
panies for the year to March 31, 1966,
are not expected until June, production
reports (which do not exactly coincide
with financial years) indicate a lower pro-
duction from Central Norseman and
slightly higher production from Gold
Mines of Kalgoorlie.
Central Norseman has reported produc-
tion of 96,559 fine oz. of gold from
184,677 tons of ore in the 52 weeks to
March 22, 1966, compared with 102,644
oz. from 181,784 tons in the financial year
to March 31, 1965. Results have been
affected by lower grades worked, especially
in October/November last year. At that
stage (36 weeks), the average grade had
been ten dwts per ton compared with
11.29 dwts in 1964/65.

Last year, reduced operating costs were
a big factor in the jump in mining profit
from $1.14 million to $1,325 million,
against a production increase of 5000 oz.
While Central Norseman seems likely to
maintain its current half-yearly dividends
of 20c per share, any further reduction
of costs could balance the effects of re-
duced mining revenue this year.
While Central Norseman is in a happy
position with reserves of medium to high-
grade ore being added to progressively,
Gold Mines of Kalgoorlie will be battling
to maintain profitability in the next few
years when the grade of its reserves will
fall further. Proven reserves, which on
current rates of production should last
about six years, average 3.8 dwts per ton
against the 4.11 dwts achieved last year.
An extensive development program is in
progress at Mt. Charlotte, but this has
necessitated the halving of dividend rates
since 1964.
In the latest year, grades seem to be
fairly steady and a total of 154,842 oz.
were produced from 757,345 tons of ore in
the 52 weeks to March 22, 1966, com-
pared with 152,487 oz. from 741,160 tons
last financial year. In that year operating
costs were significantly reduced from
$7.97 per ton of ore treated to $6.93, due
partly to increased production from Mt.
Charlotte, where costs were 40 percent
lower than at Finiston, and partly to the
increased throughput of free milling ore,
Jess costly to treat than refractory ore.
COMMODITIES
U.S. Cuts Lead Prices
THE U.S. producers’ one U.S. cent a lb. cut in domestic lead prices (to 15 U.S.
cents a lb.) reflects the continued fall in free market prices.
London prices are under 12 cents a lb.,
but freight and duty into the U.S. brings
this to 14 cents —still below the producers’
quote, yet not low enough to encourage
large-scale imports.
The course of events in the U.S. motor
industry in the near future could be an
important pointer for lead and zinc prices.
Motor car production provides a major
market for both metals —in batteries and
die castings.
A 20 percent rise in automobile die
castings in America last year boosted zinc
use by more than 50,000 tons. Without
this rise, world use of the metal would
not have gained over the year.
Climbing production of both metals
means that in 1966, more than usually,
what is bad for General Motors is bad
for lead-zinc producers.
Rubber Weakens
NEW United States stockpile release
plans have weakened free market
rubber prices, adding to the rather
dismal outlook for the natural product,
under pressure from man-made replace-
ments. Synthetics have probably hit
rubber harder than any major commodity
in recent times.
The gentleman’s agreement, formerly
used as a guide for U.S. disposals, in-
cluded provision for limits on total sales
when free market prices fall. Less re-
strictions on quantity and improvement
of selling methods daily rather than
monthly sales appears to have been
followed by a sharp rise in disposals,
according to preliminary figures.
April’s deliveries were at least the
second highest on record and any re-
vision to the preliminary figure will be
upward.
The Malaysian Government has pro-
tested that the new policy will cost it
several million dollars a year. Recently,
Communist bloc purchases of rubber have
increased and this, combined with lower-
than-expected Malayan output figures, had
caused a marginal price recovery.
Current quotes round stg. 20|d. a lb.
are lfd. down on year-ago levels. In
the past, Russian and Chinese purchases
have been variable and there appears to
be little overall growth in either market.
New Copper Process
DETAILS will shortly be available of
a new process for treating copper
ores which at present cannot be
economically mined. Should the process
live up to expectations, it would meati
a considerable increase in useful world
reserves of the metal.
Anglo American Corporation, one of the
two main Zambian producers, has been
studying the “Torco” (treatment of re-
fractory copper ores) process for some
time. Late last year the original 10 tons
of ore a day pilot plant was replaced by
a 500-ton unit.
The company is now known to have
overcome the last major technological
hurdle in the way of commercial produc-
tion. Angla has released few details,
either technological or financial.
But, if Torco is as good as expected, it
could mean a substantial lift in production
in Zambia and, probably, elsewhere.
Several deposits are known which could
perhaps be treated by the new process.
At a time when copper supply is
balanced with demand, and several con-
ventional expansion programs are under
way, the possibility of an improved treat-
ment process is of special importance.
Meanwhile, U.S. producers have been
waging an undeclared war of words against
the government’s control of their prices.


SECURITY ANALYSIS
A Good Profit Recovery
Yet Electronic Industries needs higher margins
IN terms of capital employed, Elec-
tronic Industries Limited (E.1.L.) is
far and away the largest of the com-
panies which have been considered in this
series of articles dealing with the electrical
appliance industry (sub-section, radio, and
television). This is clearly demonstrated
by the following schedule of total capital:
As at balance date in 1962 1963 1964 1965
$ million
E.I.L. 41.6 42.5 44.7 45.6
A.W.A. 21.7 22.6 23.4 24 4
E.M.I. 6.7 7.1 7.5 8.2
Pye 5.6 7.1 8.7 9.5
When one comes to look at the group
profits, the position is not as clear. The
following schedule gives the figures for
net profit before tax, depreciation, and in-
terest on long-term debt:
Year ended In 1962 1963 1964 1965
E.I.L. 2477 3146 3422 4275
A.W.A. 3784 4586 4500 4840
E.M.I. 2040 1830 1788 2342
Pye 992 1902 1610 1809
E.I.L. cannot be compared with the other
three companies because it has quite im-
portant interests outside the manufacture
of radio and television sets. The 1962
annual report showed on its cover the
various products which the group supplied
and also the sections of the community
which were supplied. The previous annual
report’s cover had drawn attention to the
fact that the group had 18 acres of modern
factories and its services covered Australia.
However, the neatest description of the
group activities occurs (in my opinion)
in the report by the chairman of the com-
pany appearing in the prospectus of an
issue of $2 million registered unsecured
notes dated March 15, 1963. This descrip-
tion is as follows:
“Electronic Industries Limited now
operates through 42 subsidiaries, 16 fac-
tories producing plastic mouldings, wood-
work, metal pressings, turnings, cathode
ray tubes, bulbs, transistors, etc., for sale
and for the purpose of manufacturing
transmitting and receiving sets, washing
machines, domestic refrigerators, television
receivers, and many other electrical
appliances. The subsidiaries sell in Aus-
tralia more -television receivers than any
other manufacturer and also have the
largest radio receiver output of any com-
pany in Australia. The company also
operates a substantial finance company, a
chain of retail stores, a chain of wholesale
warehouses, both electrical and hardware,
and an importing company.”
This description seems to indicate that
the main emphasis is on radio and tele-
vision, although the distinction between
the selling of television receivers and .the
output of radio receivers is made.
In this same prospectus, the auditors
give the usual statement showing the last
five years’ profits, in this case from 1957/8
to 1961/2 inclusive. These figures, ex-
tended now to 1964/5, are given below,
showing the percentage of each component

The change that has taken place over
this 8-year period can be seen clearly by
comparing the first and last lines in this
table. Total profit is approximately the
same, but whereas interest only took just
under 8 percent of the total in 1957/8
it took nearly 29 percent in 1964/5. The
disadvantages of high gearing in a
cyclical industry are only too well known.
This could be the reason why E.l.L.’s
shares are currently selling at a price which
offers an immediate dividend yield of 8
percent from the present 10 percent divid-
end rate (reduced from 12J percent in
1963/4).
On the other hand, the company has
given a fair amount of publicity to its bad
debt problem over the past five years.
In schedule form the position seems to
have been as follows:
Year of June 30 1961 1962 1963 1964 1965
s'ooo
Write-offs n.a. 523 611 385 500
Provisions n.a. 54 67 149 91
Total 500 577 678 534 591
In five years, the company has written
off $2.5 million in bad debts and has
made provisions totalling another $330,000
approximately. If the size of the pro-
visions against debtors is any indication
of the write-offs that have occurred, then
nearly 80 percent of the write-offs have
been against trade debtors and only 20
percent against hire purchase debtors.
The interim report for the first half of
1965/6 indicates that the bad debt prob-
lem is still present, for another $202,580
was written off during this six months; as
this figure represented only about \ .of
1 percent of total turnover, the figure must
be close to an irreducible percentage. Un-
fortunately, even before these write-offs
and provisions and after, taking into
account all the speciarwrite-offs and pro-
visions made in the 1964/5 profit and loss
account according to the chairman’s
address, it would seem that the pre-tax
profit to turnover was only about 8£ per-
cent. This would mean that net profit
after tax and minimum write-offs is un-
likely to exceed percent of turnover
until margins can be raised all round.
If it assumed that the hire purchase
business is unlikely to be making much
more than 3 percent before tax on net
outstandings (on the basis that all out-
standings are financed by borrowings), we
would find on elimination of the hire
purchase business that the net after tax
margin on the remainder of the business
is still only about 4.8 percent.
The present price for E.l.L.’s shares (the
“B” type) is $1.25. After adding back
various amounts deducted and assuming
that the bad debt write-off should not have
exceeded $383,000, I find that the
“notional earning rate” comes out at 16.9
percent. This gives an earnings yield of
13| percent or a price/earnings multiple
of 7.4. So, surprisingly enough, E.I.L. is
over-priced relative to Pye. However, one
cannot discount the good profit recovery
that has been made in the past three
years and perhaps the 12? percent divid-
end rate will be restored one day.

PLANET OIL COMPANY N.L.
The Directors of PLANET OIL COMPANY
N.L. advise that the following announce-
ments were made to the Australian Stock
Exchanges and Press on the 9th and 10th
of May, 1966.
Magnetic anomalies coincident with the
large mineralised gossans recently dis-
covered by the Company in the Peter-
mann Ranges have been revealed by an
aeromagnetic survey. The Petermann
Ranges are in the south-western corner
of the Northern Territory.
Magnetic anomalies were also detected
along the mineralised intrusive granite
contact previously reported.
A field party will leave for the area next
week to conduct an extensive outcrop
sampling programme.
PHOSPHATE
Drilling has commenced on a phosphate
prospect'on a lease held by the Company
near Kapunda, South Australia. The pur-
pose of the drilling programme is to
determine the grade and quality of the
unleached rock phosphate and the extent
of reserves. Numerous specimens of
leached surface samples from a small
former phosphate quarry have given
phosphate (P 205) values ranging between
20 and 30%.
The Company's search for phosphate in
the Cape Otway area in Victoria and in
Northern Tasmania is continuing.

MAN ON THE LAND
U.S. Food for Freedom, Or...
THE new look American farm machine
is beginning to roll and, like most
things American, the sheer size of it
is awesome. Lyndon B. Johnson has put
through easily the most important piece
of farm legislation in the world since
World War 11. It may be more than
that. It may be the biggest thing in
agriculture in the international sense since
Franklin Roosevelt’s subsidy and support
program of the 19305.
October, 1965, was the date of the
Johnson Food and Agriculture Act. We
said then, and say again, that behind all
the obviously sincere and genuine, apprecia-
tion of the food needs of a hungry world,
the possibility of large-scale U.S. dumping
on world markets does arise.
The October, 1965, Act was motivated
probably by two main forces—increasing
dissatisfaction on the part of American
farmers, which was evident during the
Truman, Eisenhower, and Kennedy Ad-
ministrations, and fear of the European
Common Market as an almost equal com-
petitor on the other side of the Atlantic.
But what made, and is making, the 1965
Act feasible is the Vietnam war.
Talk of “unleashing” American farm
production is not new. Yet until the
Vietnam war there was always the strong
possibility that it would remain talk and
little else.
The danger to the American home
market and supply system was real. No
one was courageous enough to predict the
extent of the chaos likely to result if there
was any “unleashing.” Better to leave well
alone, even though paying farmers to keep
land out of production went solidly against
everything American.
Vietnam has altered things dramatically.
Food prices are up in the United States
and farm-land prices are rocketing. Never
was there a more opportune time to make
a change. Johnson has done it.
The Act itself is so complex and am-
biguous that it is very difficult even for
American observers to nail it down. There
is not really much apparent effort to do so.
“Time” magazine, which frequently
manages to surprise Americans in telling
the world what is happening in America,
recently ran the most naive appreciation
of the rising farm-land price problem.
Farmers, according to “Time,” need more
land, and pay more for it, in order to
make their costly equipment pay.
OF,0 F , course, this is partly true, in Austra-
lia or in any industrialised country, but
it is really only an observation, not an
explanation. “Time,” whether by design
or accident, goes along with the general
American definition of the 1965 Act as
the “food for freedom” program. A
“food for freedom” Act sounds much
better than a “dumping” Act. In saying
this, one is not belittling the American
food handouts to hungry nations over the
past 25 years. They have been remark-
ably generous and all too often have re-
ceived not one iota of gratitude.
“Food for freedom” means that those
nations which can demonstrate their ability
to pay, eventually, for American food
with funds derived from an American-
approved governmental system will receive
more food than those which cannot. Viet-
nam is a reminder that the United States
is not only prepared to do business but
means business also. And why not?
From our Australian point of view the
difficulty is that we are so small. . We
are a small country —let’s not delude our-
selves. In population and production we
would rank as one of the medium-sized
States of the U.S. We have “enormous
potential.” So, for example, has Alaska.

G8:P377
month President Johnson has authorised
American farmers to plant an extra eight
million acres of wheat, with the aim of
increasing the 1967 harvest by about 200
million bushels. This extra U.S. wheat
production is only about 30 million bushels
short of our entire wheat production for
this year. It puts matters in perspective.
The total U.S. wheat acreage will be up
to around 60 million acres. The crop fore-
cast for 1966 is about 1400 million bushels
and, with the increase now authorised, the
1967 crop should be between 1500 and
1600 million bushels. While much is
made, in Washington, of the need for extra
wheat to feed the needy millions in India,
there is also acknowledgement of “strong
demand for wheat exports.”
Again, one must not, and cannot, belittle
the American gift wheat to India. But
if the present rate of gift wheat is doubled,
to say 20 million bushels, this will still
leave an additional 180 million bushels
for export to countries that can pay for
it. All told, the U.S. may have about
1000 million bushels available for export.
QHINA, no. Although it would not be
surprising if U.S. wheat does even-
tually get to China through an inter-
mediary buyer, just as Australian wool got
to Japan after the war, when there was an
official ban, through Hong Kong and other
places. Certainly U.S. exports to Russia
will be increased. All the indications are
that Russia will be a buyer of wheat for
many years to come.
Cutting through all the jargon differen-
tiating between direct subsidies, price sup-
ports, and export subsidies, the general
theme of the new U.S. system will be that
the Government can turn the tap on, or
off, as it chooses. The strong likelihood
is that it will choose to turn it on. That’s
what the American farmers, long rankled
by seeing Canadian, Australian, and
Argentine wheat production enjoying an
export boom, want and they seem to be
getting it.
We realise fully that there are still
some idealists around who assert that the
U.S. system is merely a “management of
supply” measure posing no threat to Aus-
tralia or any other wheat exporter. We
concede, in theory, that there should be
no such thing as overproduction in a
hungry world. But the real intent of the
October, 1965 Act will be shown clearly
enough, if, and when, the Kennedy Round
is sorted out and a new International
Wheat Agreement is formulated. Our
own view is that the Kennedy Round is
as dead as the man it was named after.
We hear a great deal from people in
Australia who allege that we are selling
ourselves out to the Americans, that we
are hanging on to their coat tails, currying
favor, and so on. Is it possible that, in
this, too, we are deluding ourselves into
believing that we have a choice? General
de Gaulle believes he can afford the grand
manner. He is going to make France a
major world wheat exporter, he says. He
uses the phrase “the granary of Europe.”
This, he says, is France’s destiny. The
trouble is the phrase is borrowed from the
Roman Age and this is not the Roman
Age. It is the American Age.

Clover Disease in Ewes
Some good news at last
STUDIES by the Western Australian
Department of Agriculture suggest
an elegant way of combating infer-
tility in ewes caused by grazing sub.
clover: simply increase the number of
rams running with a clover-fed ewe flock.
The theory or plan is based on only one
practical trial so far, but it is backed up
by some impressive laboratory work. This
is the first good news to be announced
about clover infertility disease in a long
while and it will gladden the ears of
breeders in the east no less than in the
west.
In recent years only doleful reports
have been issued. Generally the word
has been of new areas, widely scattered,
having been found to be affected, of more
varieties of clover having been found to
be causing the disease, or of more instances
of low-lamb marking having been de-
finitely assigned to clover grazing at the
time of mating.
At the Department’s Avondale Research
Station ewes were slaughtered at a certain
fixed interval after having mated. The
fallopian tubes, which comprise the upper-
most section of the genital tract and the
site where the sperm meet and fertilise
the egg, were then removed and searched
microscopically for sperm. It was found
that the average number of sperm appear-
ing in the fallopian tubes of ewes raised
on clover pasture was only 350, whereas
in ewes raised on grass pastures it was
17,000, i.e., nearly 50 times as many sperm
had reached this vital region. Nothing to
explain the great discrepancy was found
from intensive examination further down
the reproductive tract.
However, the large difference itself
prompted the idea of joining a greater
number of rams than is normally con-
sidered to be sufficient. With more rams
it was presumed that each ewe would be
served a greater number of times. Hence
a larger total number of sperm would be
deposited in the vagina. From this
abundance it was expected that enough
might manage to complete the journey to
the fallopian tubes to present the newly
shed egg with something like a normal
density of sperm and, consequently, a
normal chance of being fertilised. Appar-
ently, this is what happens because, as
already mentioned, when on one occasion
more rams were joined more lambs were
produced.
The word ‘“apparently” is used advisedly,
since although sperm transport, as the
process of sperm migration from the
vagina through the uterus to the fallopian
tubes is called, appears to be the unsatis-
factory function in clover-affected ewes,
several other mechanisms could also be
involved. These include fertilisation itself,
implantation of the fertilised egg in the
wall of the uterus, and the subsequent
maintenance of implantation. Mr. H. G.
Neil, the Department’s chief sheep and
wool officer, said that these matters were
also being investigated—as well they
might, since little is known about them
even in healthy animals.
That much concerning animal reproduc-
tion remains mysterious is evident from a
recent American study in which a contra-
ceptive device developed for humans was
tested on different species of animals. It
was found a few years ago that, if a small
plastic object, usually in the shape of a
spiral, coil, loop, or bow, is put into the
human uterus, reproduction rarely occurs.
These so-called intra-uterine contraceptive
devices (lUCD) do their job very effec-
tively in women and appear to have very
few or negligible adverse side effects.
Moreover, they are very cheap, costing
only a cent or less to make.
F OR these reasons the lUCD is becom-
ing very popular in the Indian birth-
control campaign. Increasing numbers
of American and European women are
also using this method, which is now
beginning to be practised by some Aus-
tralian women. How the device works in
women is not clear and for the present
it would be more accurate to call it simply
an intra-uterine device (lUD).
The American study was conducted by
agricultural scientists whose interest lay
not in contraception but rather in learn-
ing more about the normal mechanisms
of reproduction so that eventually it might
be possible to promote the reproductive
efficiency of the livestock industries.
These scientists showed that the device
halts reproduction in different ways in
different species of animals. For instance,
when an lUD was put in the uterus of
water buffaloes, egg development and the
release of mature eggs from the ovaries
was stopped. How an lUD could possibly
influence this function is almost beyond
conjecture. In this creature, therefore, the
lUD could scarcely be considered to act
either as a contraceptive or an aborti-
facient.
In ewes, on the other hand, the egg is
released from the ovary and enters the
fallopian tube, but the lUD somehow
interferes with sperm transport. In cows,
the scientists found that the actual process
of fertilisation is impeded, i.e., the device
works contraceptively in these animals.
In ewes and other ungulates the uterus
has a two-pronged shape. If the lUD is
placed in only one of the prongs or
horns, sperm won’t travel through even
the opposite one. Clearly, the implanted
spiral is not just a roadblock, as it were.
The entire sperm-transporting mechanism
must be disrupted by the device. Further
clarification of how sperm transport pro-
ceeds should lead to ways of reducing
reproductive losses in all classes of live-
stock. It is at this point that the aims of
the West Australian and American studies
converge.

SPECULATOR’S DIARY
Shocks from All Directions
What price for Anglo-Saxon attitudes?
WE investors have had to learn to become a hardy race these past few years. You
never know where the next shock is coming from London, New York, or
Sydney. All three did their bit this week to make life trying.
In Sydney it wasn’t just the summonses
being tossed about. Another surprise came
from high up in the P. & O. building
jii the form of F. W. Williams annual
profit announcement. The unpleasant
news was a drop in profit from $356,000
to $76,000. In recent years, F. W. Williams'
directors have developed a penchant for
takeovers of all sorts of companies doing
everything from making buttons to selling
light aircraft. Unfortunately, F. W.
Williams seems to have extraordinarily
bad luck with its takeovers. One by one
they turn in losses Casolin, Beutron.
and now R. J. Moulang. In its first
full year as a subsidiary of F. W. Williams.
R. J. Moulang recorded an 86 percent fall
in turnover! That must be a record that
should stand for a great many years to
come.
In the meantime, F. W. Williams has
disposed of by far its most valuable and
profitable asset, its half-interest in St
Regis-Williams. With the proceeds of
this sale (1,650,000 ACI shares), directors
still seem hell bent on further expansion
and diversification. They had better im-
prove their record pretty smartly if share-
holders are to continue to put up with
t h ern .
Experiences such as these, and This is
a relatively harmless case, have caused
many of us to lose faith in the old-
establishment family and professional
names in Australia. I, for one, have
often found it more profitable to throw
in my lot with the “New Australian” corn-
panies like Hestia, Kolotex, Mai tin Wells,
Pongrass, Hanimex, Stocks and Holdings,
and others. Their diiectors may not have
the reputations (or the grand offices) of
some of theii Anglo-Saxon counterpaits
but they seem to know how to run success-
ful businesses.
It was with these thoughts in mind that
I turned to Haulage Equipment. Now
hen- is a company with a checkered career
if ev er there was one. It was originally
Tungsten Consolidated, then it became
Haulage Equipment, and next month it
wi „ } XH . ()me Advance Industries. Already-
j, is Advance Industries in everything but
name following a reverse takeover earlier
...
nsyta . . . ,
Advance operates in the plasm s mdus-
try, making disposable plastic containers
ar >d drinking cups, plastic stationeiy
(binders, files, etc.), and advertising and
promotional material. Directors are
Messrs. B. Ferster, S. S. Ferster, V. New-
man, and P. Ryba. Between them these
gentlemen have built up a nice little
record of rising sales and profits. Last
year’s profit of $90,000 would give an
earning rate of more than 25 percent on
the public company’s enlarged capital of
$370,000. A 10 percent dividend rate
has been forecast. The shares are selling
at about 55 cents but they have a par
value of only 25 cents, so they are not
all that cheap. Nevertheless, with the
promise of a higher profit this year and
on the performance of other “backdoor
listings,” the shares still appealed to me
at this early stage of their new career.
This turned out to be my only pur-
chase of the week, what with the British
Budget, the fall in Wall Street, and the
sudden collapse of the Cottees takeover.
Nevertheless, it was a week full of
temptations. I very nearly sold my
Cottees when they went up to $3.20. Next
day, when they came back to $2.95, I
put in an order to buy more but luckily
they went up over my limit again. Next
day, with the takover hopes dashed, they
were down to $2.50. Being a true coward,
I couldn’t face up to this loss, so decided
to hold on in the' hope of some recovery
after the initial shock. The recovery will
take time, 1 fear, with so many speculators
being caught on this one.
INSTEAD, I took the dangerous step of
“shorting” some Tooths, just for kicks.
I did this when they got up to $5.30 in
anticipation of the annual report and the
long-awaited bonus issue. I can't imagine
that the profit rise will be anything sen-
sational and I really doubt if the much
talked of bonus will be made just yet.
Even if it is, it will need to be a
pretty good one, as it’s over ten years
since the last bonus. That w'as a l-for-2.
Anything less on this occasion will, I
believe, disappoint the market. Whether
the disappointment will be sufficient to
lower the shares sufficiently to cover the
20-odd cents commission is, of course,
another matter.
The only other transaction this week
was the sale of another of my static stocks,
B. J. Ball, to pay for the Haulage Equip-
ments. A small loss here of about $3O
after taking the dividend into account.
BOUGHT
500 Haulage Equipment, 54c, $276
SOLD
400 B. J. Ball, 83c, $330
200 Tooth, $5.30, $5.41.
These transactions left me a small debit
of $34. The portfolio now' is:

System/360
is for you
if you always buy
on price
Look at System/360 the way you look at a new
lathe, truck or a materials handling system.
To judge value, you must look at more than
basic equipment price.
You must first measure total work done.
Then measure total dollars spent for that work.
We designed System/360 to cut costs by
increasing total work done per dollar.
System/360, and the programming systems
that come with it, let you handle more than one
job at a time. These programming systems take
over much of the work of scheduling and
routing data through the system.
That speeds programming and simplifies
operation. It cuts the time it takes to go from a
manager with a problem to a computer and back
to the manager with a solution to the problem.
Here’s another way System/360 keeps down your costs.-
It comes in your size. If you are small, the
system is small. If you’re big, the system is big.
You can tailor it to fit. You don’t have to limp
along with a system that’s not quite big enough
or fast enough.
You’ll never be saddled with a system that’s
more powerful than you need for existing
problems. Not now. Nor next year. Nor five
years from now.
The programming, the central processor, the
printers, files, communications terminals
everything fits like a glove. A stretchable glove.
You see, System/360 grows as your needs
grow. Just as quickly. Just as slowly. It ex-
pands without major reprogramming expense,
it helps you grow. It helps you make a profit
to grow with. Wouldn’t you like
a computer like that?
