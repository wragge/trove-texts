The Sunday Mail
Brisbane
Should be Included in Every National
Advertising Campaign
As a newspaper the “Sunday Mail” speaks for itself, and the average
net circulation for June (47,445), July (47,597), August (49,561) and Sep-
tember (over 51,000) bears testimony to the ever-widening circle of readers
of Queensland’s great Sunday newspaper-magazine and to the ready appreci-
ation with which it is received wherever it goes.
The consistently increasing popularity of the “Sunday Mail” renders neces-
sary its inclusion in every national advertising campaign planned for the
Queensland market. Used in conjunction with the “Courier Mail,” Queens-
land’s greatest daily, it gives a combination unequalled in coverage and
lowness of cost. Further particulars gladly supplied on request.

The Week’s Best ? —
FAULKNER’S
LATEST SHORT
STORIES
Even at this
day, with half a
dozen sound
b ooks to his
name, William
Faulkner remains
virtually unknown in Australia. Our
measure of cynicism may decide whether
that is surprising or otherwise.
Practising writers here need not be
counted in. They might conceivably read
him to see what they could learn from
him, but the few capable of learning
from anybody possibly comprise his
entire local public. As to the general
reader, the disinclination may be simply
explained, somewhat in terms of skirts.
In common with the few other first-rate
prose-writers of America, Faulkner is
interested chiefly in the male character,
and approaches that animal with mascu-
line objectivity—an assertion of self
natural enough in such an overskirted
country. Also, though he has sentiment,
sentimentality even, it is not of the
skirted sort. Additionally, he is generally
so impersonal as to be almost aestheti-
cally aloof. Such things are no recipe
for popularity.
As to the making of literature, his
equipment is complete enough. Because
he writes with feeling, purpose, definite-
ness, he achieves reality. He is a good
constructor of narrative, a brilliant man-
ager of dialogue, a singularly individual-
istic conjuror of landscapes ; with a grim
humor. His substance is completely,
most admirably, American.. On occasion
he does his best to look like a man
tangled up in a streamers-at-the-quay sort
of presentation, as in the title-piece of
his latest book, Doctor Martino, which
piece is rank with shallow mumbo-jumbo
besides. Alsto—not here, but in his big
novel, Light in August —he indulges a
fancy for having three or four words
run into one: nothing serious; just
plainsillyshowoff; the sort of thing any
decrepit typewriter can do without assist-
ance. On the whole, he writes cleanly ;
beautifully, in fact—especially in the con-
juring of his scenes, which, after all, is
where most beautiful writing comes in.
Of these stories in particular “Fox
Hunt” is a choice example of his gift for
landscape—singular, because the medium
appears to be one wholly of black-and-
white : woodcuts would be best for illus-
trating him. “The Hound” holds a theme
on which he produces many variations—
the extent to which the African jungle
emanations have entered into the sub-
conscious of whites of his Southern
States. “Smoke” is worth the reading,
if only to see that usually so meritricious
a thing, the murder detection story, used
in the making of narrative art. One
other, “Death Drag,” is a superb piece
of modern pure comedy, as fine a thing
as Faulkner has done.
It seems probable that Australian
literature would profit enormously from
a full awareness here of all such work.
That might not be merely desirable ; it
might be essential. Its absence might be
held to account for much.
PROMETHEUS
H. L. MENCKEN
ROARS AGAIN
Another of
these muscular-
minded masculine
Americans, H. L.
Mencken, roars
forth in Treatise
on Rig{it and Wrong, a companion
volume, as he explains, to his Treatise
on the Gods, and following the same
general plan.
To those who know the other work
that will be ample in-
dication ; for those
who don’t it means
simply that this latter-
day Prometheus is
still bound to the rock
by his hatred of the
intellectually subver-
si v e elements in
American life, and is
doing his damnedest
to sound as if he’s
laughing. Naturally,
it is hardly happy
laughter. On the con-
trary, it is about as
sardonic, and as pur-
poseful, as any that
has roared itself out
into English literature.
The position,
though uncomfort-
able. is not the worst
for thinking in. He
even manages to pro-
duce a thesis, which is
a respectable perform-
ance in any circum-
stances. Briefly, his
general contention is
that ethics is a science,
and not the vague and
indefinite concept the
metaphysicians and theologists, to serve
their loose purposes and protect them-
selves from reason, delude themselves,
and their dupes, into thinking it
is. This boils down to a contention for
reason, as against religion.
It is reason, and not religion, he roars,
that has been responsible for such asser-
tions of right over wrong as the emanci-
pation of women and the State protec-
tion of children and animals. Not only
do these owe nothing whatever to reli-
gion ; the official forces of Christianity
have opposed them vigorously, and are
still strongly opposing at least one of
them, the emancipation of women, and
its concomitant, birth control. His final
finding is that the world must look fo
reason, and not to religion, to tell it
what is good for it; to separate among
the new values that are brought to man-
kind by progress those that have truth
and those that have mere appearance ;
to say truthfully what is right and what
is wrong.
Taken simply for the hearty sound of
it, this is hale and vigorous roaring, and
it happens to have the authority of a
deep erudition. An enormous number
will resent his argument line by line, but
few capable of a disinterested literary
outlook will dispute that literature has
little better to offer in the way of invec-
tive than that of this fat-faced American.
He and Faulkner and their kind offer a
rousing stimulant, quite apart from their
textual objects.

Trumpeting
Abnormality
Huxley once
said “A beautiful
hypothesis can toe
shattered by a
single ugly fact,”
or words to that
effect. This holds good in the case of
M. G. Skipper’s article concerning the
abnormality of artists (R.P. 24/10/’34).
Here’s the thing which Mr. Skipper
overlooks. The highly specialised type of
mind, through being concentrated upon
a narrow field, can become very learned
in some directions; but this can also
lead to other portions of the brain be-
coming atrophied through disuse or re-
maining in a state of childlike undevelop-
ment, producing an individual akin to
genius in some ways and a child, idiot
Or beast in others.
If the idiosyncrasies take the form of
ignorance of the simple things of every-
day life, a love for sensationalism or
other harmless kinks, the average man
will laugh and let the artist go his way
unchecked ; if they lead the specialist to
a disregard for the feelings of others, a
contempt for the laws of the land or
into a slough of bestiality or perversion,
then he must be checked for the common
weal. There was no harm in a learned
legal luminary, as instanced by Mr. Skip-
per, driving to his office in hunting cos-
tume. Such an example is not catching.
But if such a man had unmentionable
personal habits he would be certain to
create scores of imitators. For Wilde to
wear velvet pants harmed nobody; his
other acts, which led to the criminal
court, were a far different matter.
The normal man, in frowning upon the
acts of the abnormal ones and doing his
best to see punishment inflicted for
breaches of natural laws or those made
to govern a community, is obeying a
natural law himself. Animals who live
in flocks and herds drive out or kill the
weakly and sick or injured, knowing in-
stinctively that their presence is liable to
draw upon the herd the attention of its
enemies. The human animal carries this
one step farther with his reasoned know-
ledge and lays down laws —based more
or less upon a fundamental code like the
Ten Commandments—which he does his
best to make all obey, including the
eccentric, freakish or depraved, for with-
out a majority obeying a legal code a
community cannot exist. In the past civi-
lisations have arisen and have flourished
as long as a majority obeyed the com-
munity laws; when only the minority
were doing so it meant that the rot had
set in and that sooner or later a horde of
hairy men riding shaggy ponies, reared
in a community which obeyed a legal
code, would descend upon that rot-
riddled civilisation.
Quite often we get a brain capable of
specialising, yet able to develop evenly
in other ways. The result is a man like

Kipling, who, as Banjo Paterson observes
in his recently published Happy Dis-
patches, has no kinks whatever. Other
famous men whom he had met were
libertines, alcoholics, hopeless dullards
in all but a few subjects, or moral lepers.
He was so surprised to find in Kipling
an artist who was also a sober, decent
husband, father, citizen, friend and busi-
nessman that' he devoted a lot of space
in his book to point out the remarkable
fact.
Fortunately, for every Wilde born
upon this earth, a Kipling is brought
forth, too. There have been many artists,
writers and leaders who in their leisure
hours did not seek an example for their
amusements in the monkey-house, home
for cretins or the pigpen. Neither did
they seek a moral example in the fowl-
yard. It is a happy thing, for were it
not so the world might have to do with-
out art and artists. If all great minds
set us a horrible example the result
would be corruption spreading from the
top downward.
H. A. LINDSAY.
Dodgers of
Reality
It is true that
much of the ideals
of the Victorian
age, its respect
for salvation and
three per cent.,
the stability of the pound and the saddle
of mutton, has been recorded by Gals-
worthy ; but the present-day world left
him bewildered and hostile, and he was
reduced to depicting it through the eyes
of the vaguely philosophical Michael
Mont and of the hard, restless, sensation-
craving Fleur. We are in a different
world after the death of Timothy, and
we can never accept the present.
Of the other novelists who were hailed
as great or near-great in Edwardian days
none has accomplished the feat of accept-
ing the modern world and making litera-
ture of it. D. H. Lawrence, heretic of
love, was lost in his private universe
where surrender was not to be greeted
by surrender, where man was to have
all and remain whole. Compton Mac-
kenzie became a writer of novelettes,
Gilbert Cannan wrote himself out in a
dark passion of revolt and Russian in-
fluences, and
Hugh Walpole,
a superficially
brilliant crafts-
man, became
the bondsman
of his conven-
tional ideas.
Later writers
are no closer to
life. A 1 do u s
Huxley has re-
acted against
the modern
world and ex-
pressed his con-
tempt in a book
in which the
stupidities of
the present day
are magnified in
the future. J. B.
Priestley had to
escape from
reality into a
belief that the
characteristic of
the English
novel was
humor. T. F.
Powys and
Richard Hughes
turn to elabor-
ate and rather
sterile fantasies,
and of the
others, the Sit-
wells, Waughs,
Mottrams and
Coppards, they
cover their poverty with remarkable
technique, but suffer a barrenness of
general ideas. It is curious that at
this moment it should have been the
women who have saved English fiction ;
it is certainly true that literature
would not be the same without the names
of G. B. Stern, Storm Jameson, Mar-
garet Kennedy, Romer Wilson and Vir-
ginia Woolf.
It is perhaps true, as Sir Edmund
Gosse maintained, that the poverty of the
English novel is due to the national
genius having gone into poetry, but it is
also certain that until there is sincerity
of outlook and approach there can be
no hope of building up any sort of
structure worth the name. You must be-
lieve in the importance of your materials
and in the significance of the work you
are doing to create anything, in art as in
engineering. To skim the surface of a
nation’s doings is not to penetrate far
into the national character, or to give
the world any characters of your own.
If we look back to our famous novelists
of the past we find that Defoe’s Roxana,
Smollett’s Count Fathom, Fielding’s Jona-
than Wild may not have been pleasant
people to know, but at least they were
alive and moving through a scene that
is recognisably part of the land in which
they lived. They were not merely pent in
drawing-rooms and country houses or
flitting from nightclub to nightclub, with
occasional visits to ladies’ boudoirs.
The denial of life as it is lived, the
acceptance of a small portion of it for
the whole, the reading of national char-
acter in terms of the epigram, the modern
flat and the cocktail-shaker, or else in
terms of the middle-class family with
relatives throughout the professions and
a comfortable existence—this is the weak-
ness of the modern English literature. It
is, perhaps, one explanation of the fact
that the basic theme in English comedies
for the past generation and in English
films to-day is the (perfectly innocent)
visit of a young lady to a gentleman’s
bedroom. It has certainly robbed that
literature of vitality, and it has equally
certainly divorced it from modernity
because of a divorce from the realities
of modern life.
QUENTIN POPE.
Tea-party
Culture
Cecil Mann’s
articles on Aus-
tralian 1i t erary
so c i eties (R.P.
26/9/’34 and
17/10/’34) are
praiseworthy attacks on a phase of cul-
tural parasitism in this country that is
growing more nauseous day by day.
Most of these societies have been
started by women, are managed by
women and largely attended by women.
Nominally they may have a university
professor as president, but, actually,
women run the show.
Now and again they offer a guinea, or
at most a couple of guineas, for a short
Story or “poem,” and God help anyone
who suggests that all Australian women
aren’t virtuous. These gatherings of
hangers-on to the literary hem are re-
ported with full seriousness in the daily
newspapers. Every one pays compli-
ments. Local poetesses write each other
up, and are listened to as if they spoke
with the voice of Euripides. Now and
again their literary evenings are flavored
with readings and discussions on “great
novels.” The social and university set
turns up, digests its Walpole and Priest-
ley and Philip Gibbs, and goes home
suffused with culture. Listen-in to their
cosmic pronouncements on literature
and you’ll find the dear ladies talking
about their favorite authors as if they
had given birth to them.
There’s too much of that sort of thing
going on, and no writer of any integrity
should want to belong to these societies.
Solitude is the best developer of his
powers. If he can become a pariah for
a few years the better for him. He’ll
learn to chew over the world and him-
self, and his feet will touch solid rock.
If he’s got any rights to fight for as an
author, let him fight with his equals and
then retire. The curse of this generation
is young writers making a success and
then turning social. You see it in
London at its worst.
E. R. D.
A Satchel of Books
Isak Dinesen, pseudonymous author of
a recent “Week’s Best” choice, Seven
Gothic Tales, is revealed as the Danish
Baroness Blixen. The English edition
of the tales has now been done by Put-
nam.
Fancy Dress Ball, by J. Jefferson Far-
jeon (Collins; 7s. 6d.). The happenings
occur in a night of the Chelsea Arts
Ball, casting his gaze over the proceed-
ings of which the author seeks to see
beyond the general mask what dire things
are happening on the spot to a number
of those present. Unfortunately, omni-
science isn’t a part of his equipment, and
all he succeeds in doing is to put a
thicker mask over the already masked.
Except when the author is expressing
opinion, which is often, A Shorter His-
tory of England, by Hilaire Belloc
(Harrap; 10s. 6d., English price), is a
good, useful, handy condensation of its
large subject ranged under headed para-
graphs. Quite admirable for the usage
for which it was no doubt designed.
A Stone for Sharpening, by Bridget
Lowry (Hodder and Stoughton;
Dymock’s ; 7s. 6d.). Felicity’s guardian,
who had taken her from a foundlings’
home, dies suddenly, leaving her totally
unprovided for. Felicity is 18 and pretty,
she has £3B, extravagant tastes and only
determination to help her earn her living.
She fails as a governess, and things look
pretty black till she gets a job in a pie-
stall, but from then on they brighten.
An entertaining story without pretending
to anything more.
Carlyle in Old Age (Kegan Paul; 155.,
English price). David Alec Wilson lived
to complete five volumes of his monu-
mental “Carlyle”; this, the sixth and
last book, has been done by his nephew,
D. Wilson MacArthur. Here, in the
Last Phase,” the old man has become
magnet to world-wide pilgrimage. He
is commanded to the Queen’s presence,
Disraeli offers him the Grand Cross of
the Bath, Bismarck would see him, the
German Empress gives him special audi-
ence, poets, musicians, historians seek
his society ; last scene of all, he is buried
with almost Boetian simplicity in prefer-
ence to entombment in Westminster
Abbey. Which is as he himself would
have had it.
The two plays in Eugene O’Neill’s Ah,
Wilderness (Cape; 7s. 6d. net), sound
like a belated bid for all-round popu-
larity. The title-piece is an American
domestic comedy of a kind that flooded
the Australian stage five or six years ago.
No better and no worse than those fore-
Eugene O’Neill
runners, it
should be ap-
plauded by
those who like
the lush com-
edic melodrama
of muddled
domesticity. The
other piece,
“Days Without
End,” is con-
siderably better,
both in con-
struction and
theme. A
miracle play, it introduces the leading
character’s conscience as a separate,
visible and talking figure; and in the
early scenes, when Conscience is having
at its owner in the matter of telling the
full truth in his novel, it is sincere and
effective ; a good exposure, also, of the
hypocritical author—which is virtually
every author—struggling against the
inner urge to out with it and be hanged
to the consequences. Before the end the
piece lapses into pure “Sign of the Gross”
bellowdrama.
Elizabeth, by Frank Swinnerton
(Hutchinson; 7s. 6d.). So effortlessly
done that its ease of expression merges
into diffuseness, this is a better-than-
average piece of fiction, with an English
seaside town setting and a varied and
engaging lot of characters very well por-
trayed.
Six Plays (Heinemann ; 7s. 6d., Eng-
lish price). In the prevailing fashion for
giving readers extravagant value for their
money. Contents: Noel Coward’s “De-
sign for Living,” Clemence Dane’s “Wild
Decembers,” Ferber and Kaufman’s
“Dinner at Eight,” Maugham’s “Shep-
pey,” Priestley’s “Dangerous Corner”
and Keith Winter’s “Rats of Norway.”
All three-acters; the book plainly but
agreeably turned out.
Bracken Turning Brown, by Pamela
Wynne (Collins ; 7s. 6d.). An uncom-
monly well-handled triangle-romance,
with a barrister, taken in as a paying
guest, fallen in love with the young wife
of a clerical dipsomaniac. The end is
rank melodrama, but up till then the
characterisation is sound, the action well
managed and the setting, the English
Lakes country, finely projected.
Angus and Robertson have published
at 4s. 6d. an Australian edition of Leslie
Moore’s The Peacock Feather. The
novel, which appeared in England years
ago and more recently as a “Mirror”
serial, is a sweetly romantic tale of a
vagabond writer and a lady with whom
he corresponds. A most delicate love
story.
The Centenary Gift Book (Robertson
and Mullens, Melb. ; 55.) is published
for the Women’s Centenary Council,
profits to go to the fund for a Memorial
to Pioneer Women. It is well-printed,
well-bound on good paper ; just the thing
to send away as a memento. The whole
of the contents, literary and artistic, are
the work of Victorian women, and virtu-
ally every Victorian woman who is
known in either of the arts is represented.
A Choice of Verse: —
THE PASSIONATE CLERK TO HIS LOVE.
Live with me ; be my wife ;
We’ll end flirtations ;
You’ll find it a slow life,
But with compensations.
We’ll soon get a flat
With two witty
Rooms, a bath and kitchenette,
High over the city,
Where, in the evening,
When dinner s over,
We’ll wash up everything,
And I’ll be your lover,
And tie knot after \not
of flesh aching;
Then cut the lot,
And without waging
You’ll sleep till sunrise,
And well rise early,
And through each other’s eyes
We’ll see things clearly,
And never be dismayed
To find them shoddy,
And never be afraid
Of anybody ;
N.S.W.
And on Sunday afternoon
About three or four
I’ll play the gramophone
While you pour
Afternoon-tea
Into my soul,
And bending to me
With the sugar-bowl
You’ll be a priestess
Swaying the sheathing
Of a flower-stained dress
With even breathing
And in this atmosphere
Charmed by your breast
Half we shall hear
And feel the rest
As we tal\ scandal and
A find of wit
We alone understand,
Or maybe just sit
Quiet while the cloc\ chimes
Patient to-morrows,
And smile sometimes
At old sorrows.
RONALD McCUAIG.

THE FUNCTION OF A FLEET.
“War between the American and British
nations is unthinkable,” said London
“Times” last week ; “it would end our
civilisation.” It is bad policy to dismiss
a contingency as unthinkable because it
is horrifying. Distinguished Americans
have pointed out unequivocally circum-
stances in which the U.S.A. might be
forced into a war with Britain. Frank
Simonds has written in a British maga-
zine as conservative as the “National
Review”: —•
Few Englishmen realise the extent to
which English sea-power weighed upon the
American mind during the Civil War.
Our histories teach us that for four years
our struggle to preserve the Union was
hampered by British sea-power... .Nor, I
venture to guess, do Englishmen realise the
extent to which American opinion has
crystallised in the belief that we were
made belligerents in the World War by
reason of British use of sea-power We
are building our fleet for the purpose of
“waging” neutrality the next time Britain
goes to war
In pursuance of this policy, the U.S.A.
has refused to join the League of
Nations. The main object of the League
was originally to impose sanctions on
any nation guilty of aggression; and
chief among them was to have been a
naval blockade by the Royal Navy. One
of the meanings of the fleet which
America has built under the Washington
Treaty is that there are to be no more
naval blockades by Britain. America
would fight first.
Though an Anglo-American war is
thus by no means unthinkable, it is for-
tunately extremely improbable. Particu-
larly in the near future. There are sev-
eral good reasons, and perhaps the best
of them is that by the Washington Treaty
(1922) and the London Treaty (1930) the
U.S.A. may build up to 1,230,600 tons
and Britain up to 1,151,450 tons. Powers
so evenly matched rarely risk going to
war if they can avoid it.
Because the Japanese are limited to
714,120 tons, their Government, to quote
a cable of last week, “is definitely com-
mitted to the abrogation of the Washing-
ton Treaty before December 31.” The
Japanese are no more anxious for war
than the British or the Americans. Rear-
Admiral Yamamoto is reported to have
said during the naval discussions which
have been proceeding in London:
Even granting that Japan and the United
States had equal fleets, the American navy
could easily repulse the Japanese navy if
it approached American shores.
Japan obviously has no wish to approach
American shoses. But its Government
means to develop Manchukuo now, and
it may intend to declare a sort of Monroe
Doctrine in respect of Northern China
in the future. So it needs a stronger
fleet—-not necessarily, or even probably,
to fight with, but to bargain with: for
business purposes. At next year’s Naval
Conference America is bound to ask
for guarantees that the Open Door
will be maintained in China. Japan,
if limited to a small navy, might have
to agree ; with a large navy in being, or
only building, it would perhaps be less
pliant.
So lasting alliances between Britain
and the U.S.A. and Japan and the
U.S.A. are impossible. Their basic inter-
ests conflict. Nor is it conceivable that
the U.S.A. should combine with Britain
against Japan or that Japan should com-
bine with Britain against the U.S.A. All
three Powers have valuable assets in the
Pacific which would be endangered if
any of them was to suffer the fate of
Carthage. There would even be danger
if one of them allowed its fleet—the force
by which its properties are policed— to
be greatly weakened. Peace in the Pacific
epends on strong fleets in or adjacent
to the Pacific.
Australia s position in the matter is
r e fL r ' * *! as the friendliest feelings for
both America and Japan, but it is bound
by every be of sentiment and interest to
Britain. By as much as the British fleet
is weakened relatively to the fleet of
either of the other Pacific Powers Aus-
!l a la is weakened, and by as much as
fie R.A.N. is weakened Britain is weak-
ened.
In 1928 Australia acquired two
new county-class cruisers, two ocean-
going submarines and an aircraft-carrier.
All but the cruisers are now out of com-
mission, other ships have been placed in
reserve many ranks and ratings have
joined the unemployed army. It is bad
business, to put it on the lowest grounds.
Ihe primary object of every fleet is to
get and keep trade, and Australia in the
next tew years is going to need all the
trade it can get.
GOLD MIGHT DO IT.
“Lake View and Star made £545,000 Aus-
(Mlian from its Golden Mile leases last year,
and declared dividends amounting to 574 p.c.
of capital. Wiluna (W.A.) is reporting a mine
profit of between £50,000 and £60,000 Aus-
tralian a month.”
Is there any way out of the bog of debt,
depression and unemployment which
still encompasses us, after five years?
No short cut paved with paper which
will not bear the nation’s weight, but a
track which it might take with safety,
and with a fair chance of winning real
treasure sufficient for its needs, mobilis-
ing in the search multitudes of its idle
manhood. Dr. A. C. Rivett suggests that
there is a way out, and he is no vision-
ary or quack. Rhodes scholar, M.A.,
B.Sc. (Oxford), D.Sc. (Melbourne), Pro-
fessor of Chemistry, Deputy-Chairman
and Chief Executive Officer of the Coun-
cil for Scientific and Industrial Research,
he is one of the ablest men in Australia.
South Africa' has shown that gold pro-
duction can get a country with great
auriferous resources out of the worst of
its troubles in a world which has largely
“gone off gold.” Dr. Rivett’s notion is
that Australia, “a heavily mineralised
country,” is capable of doing what South
Africa has done, and more. Addressing
himself chiefly to the problem of our
overseas debts, he says:
On June 30, 1932, we owed in London
£554,528,000 sterling, and the annual inter-
est bill was £26,301,000. With gold at £6
sterling per ounce, we need 134 tons of it
to pay the yearly bill, 2830 tons to
liquidate the debt. We are not bending
our energies to the production of 134 tons
of gold every year, let alone 2830 tons
over several years to clear us of our ex-
ternal obligation altogether. We scarcely
think of the principal sum owed: and
we strive to pay the interest bill with wool,
wheat, beef, mutton, apples, butter, eggs
and wine.
Unlike gold, with its 50 p.c. increase in
value on a sterling basis, all these other
products have to be converted into sterling
at figures below those of depression years
All the time there is a steadily in-
creasing black cloud on the horizon,
namely, the unwillingness of our creditors
to take payment in these products.
“We hear, and more than hear,” Dr.
Rivett proceeds, “of export quotas for
Australian wheat and beef and butter.”
But not of an export quota for gold.
John Bull needs that commodity. It was
largely because he sent far too much
gold across the Atlantic (“4200 tons from
1923 to 1931”) without making provision
for replenishing the supply that disaster
smote the world: “The metal left Trea-
suries where it had supported currency
or credit and given confidence and secu-
rity, and it did not return; collapse and
chaos ensued.” Yet J.B. had within his
own Empire the means of making up the
loss. “During the last 10 years the out-
put of the South African mines” alone
“could have been increased by at least
40,000 ounces, or 1225 long tons.”
Output could have been increased in
Australia, too, and could be immensely
increased now.
To get 2830 tons of gold we must dis-
cover, dig out and treat some 264 million
tons of 7dwt. ore. Assume a density of
2.5 for the ore, and the volume we require
is about 3790 million cubic feet; put in
another way, a heap 1 square mile in
area and 44 yards high. Is it stretching
the imagination too much to believe that
such a pile exists in Australia in reason-
ably accessible deposits? In some parts
4dwt. and sdwt. ore pays at present.
But if it did not quite do this the game
might still be worth the candle.
For one thing, many men would be
taken off the dole:
Gold-mining absorbs labor in great
quantity, and mining camps to-day, with
modern health measures and the social
amenities made possible by broadcasting
and other means, can be made to offer
attractions which would appeal strongly to
the scores of thousands of strong men and
youths now condemned to idleness.
One difficulty to be overcome is the
habit of applying 40- or 50-year-old
methods to present-day problems. This
Australian scientist remarks truly that
“the search for auriferous deposits is in
general not being conducted with any-
thing like the thoroughness and care
that we bestow upon the attainment' jf
profitable crops of sultanas and fat
lambs.” On the part of a certain type
of mining speculator it is subordinated to
the search for mugs. “The practice of
giving an unemployed man a tent, a
pick and a shovel and sending him
out to prospect is an anachronism”;
yet it goes on, even in Westralia. At the
same time, “intensive effort along the
best modern lines is being directed to the
discovery of large low-grade deposits”:
All honor to the men who are responsible
for this and are bringing their mining ex-
perience and the skill of geologists, geo-
physicists and aviators to bear upon the
problem: but may there not be sound
justification for greatly increased activity,
organised on a national basis, along like
lines over much bigger areas and on a scale
beyond anything yet attempted? If so,
the time for action is now. Maybe the
whole time available will be compara-
tively short.
Dr. Rivett’s article appears in the C. S.
and I. R. “Journal.” It should be read
and read again by every member of every
Government in Australia. He proposes
no fantastic experiment in State gold-
mining (“the actual exploitation of new
deposits would rest with others”), but.
he suggests a scheme which it is within
the capacity of our Governments, acting
in concert, to set in motion, first putting
a stop to the traffic in proved gold-
bearing leases abandoned to the Crown.
As Dr. Rivett says, “If we can do more
good for the country by finding and
selling gold-bearing ore than by grow-
ing and selling wheat, we ought not to
avoid a re-examination of our pro-
grammes of work.” So far, in arrang-
ing “programmes of work” the imagina-
tions of our Premiers have not soared
above sewers, swimming baths and “uni-
fication of railway gauges between the
capital cities,” none of which undertak-
ings, however desirable, will add a
penny to the production of wealth,
though they may all add massively to the
production of deficits.
AN AUSTRALIAN IN THE SAAR.
The Australian with the hardest job at
the moment is Geoffrey George Knox,
sometime First Secretary to the British
Ministry in Cairo, now chairman of the
Saar Governing Commission. With him
on the Commission are a Finn, a Yugo-
slav, a Saarlander and a Frenchman.
Before him a Canadian was chairman,
and before the Canadian a Frenchman.
The Saar is about the size of the
metropolitan areas of Sydney, Brisbane
and Melbourne put together. Three-
fourths of it used to be in Prussia and
one-fourth in Bavaria. It has a popu-
lation of 800,000, and is almost entirely
surrounded by contention.
When the Germans invaded France
they destroyed the coalmines of the Nord
and the Pas de Calais. So when the Ver-
sailles Treaty was being drafted Clemen-
ceau and Tardieu came to the conclu-
sion that France must have the Saar for
a period as compensation. On second
thoughts they decided that the period
might just as well be everlasting. They
discovered that opinion in the Saar was
“predominantly French,” though the last
pre-war census showed that there were
only a few dozen French-speaking fami-
lies among tens of thousands of German
units.
The population has a permanence
unusual on mining fields. Most of
the miners have their own farmlets,
and the ancestors of some of them
have lived in the one house for
hundreds of years. It, therefore,
might be not unreasonable to think
that the old Tiger and his lieutenant
formed their opinion that the place was
Gallic by nature because its coal and
steel would be a wonderful asset, because
its high plateau of the Gau, about Saar-
louis, is one of the strongest defensive
points along the French frontiers, and
because the Saar River connects con-
veniently with the French canal system.
Lloyd George and Woodrow Wilson
stood out against annexation, but agreed
to a plebiscite in January, 1935, by
which the people would decide their own
fate. They agreed also that the Saar
should be controlled by the League
of Nations, France to have “abso-
lute possession of the coalmines,
with exclusive rights of exploitation, un-
encumbered and free from all debts, and
charges of any kind,” until the pleb-
iscite was taken. Half the mine groups
belonged to Prussia; two to Bavaria;
two private groups controlled the rest.
The first chairman, M. Rault, made
his induction a sort of welcome-home to
a rescued bit of France. Actually Louis
XIV. held the Saar for a few years, and
so did Napoleon. The French Govern-
ment became so convinced that the dis-
trict was and always had been French
that it prosecuted the two biggest local
industrialists, the Rochling brothers,
for having, while in the German Army,
appropriated captured machinery for
German munition purposes. It did every-
thing it could, quite naturally, to force
shareholders in the coal and steel indus-
try to sell out to French combinations.
It had French taught in the schools. But
most of the simple Saarlanders merely
went on with their work, saying “O
Ja?” whenever the brand-new flag which
had been invented for them was waved
or whenever one of their deliverers
shouted “Vive la France!”
They did not like the French tongue.
The shareholders in the Saar companies
did not like having France freed from
liability to themselves, nor did creditors
who were told to turn to Germany for
compensation. They liked it less after
1926-27, when the mines in the regions
occupied in 1914-18 were back in
working order, repairs having been paid
for mainly out of German reparations.
Before 1932 there was a deal of tur-
moil. Large French sections of public
opinion said “Annex, and be damned to
Germany and the League! ” The League
spent many polyphonic hours on the sub-
ject. Then Hitler arrived in power.
The Saar coal output, which had once
gone almost entirely into German-owned
industry, was now equal to 10 p.c. of the
German coal output. It was wholly ap-
plied to French uses, such as building
gun power on the Nivelle Line, the tre-
mendous fortified frontier which now
runs almost from Switzerland to the
sea. The German pig-iron output
dwindled from 16,700,000 metric tons in
1913 to 5,000,000 tons in 1933. The
ingot steel output of the Reich fell in
the same period from 17,000,000 tons
to 7,500,000 tons. The Saar’s 1,750,000
tons of steel, 1,500,000 tons of pig and
10,500,000 tons of coal p.a. would be
a very welcome addition to Germany’s
resources. The loss of them was doubly
exasperating, since they were basically
German-owned.
Hitler and Gobbels can be tactful
sometimes. Most Saarlanders are Catho-
lics of the South German type. Many
dislike Hitler. That potentate proceeded
to attack them with both barrels. Von
Papen, a Catholic party leader, was de-
puted to persuade, and a Nazi Saar
Commissioner, who assumed the air of
a local Governor, settled down to intimi-
date. Commission census documents
disappeared; a sort of local inquisition
investigated the views of municipal
authorities, and bullied out of office
those in favor of France or of
maintaining the status quo. French-
speaking citizens were threatened.
Branches of that charming Munich
society the “Roll-Association” (“Heads
Will Roll”) sharpened their axes at points
which could be seen from Saarlouis. And
the noise of all the internal strife was
almost drowned by assurances that
France was about to send troops to
Saarbrucken and that Hitler was pre-
paring an army.
The League cackled, and four months
ago warned the High Contending
Parties that they had each given
undertakings not to influence the pleb-
iscite or interfere with the right of indi-
vidual voters (all residents over 20) to
determine their own destiny. They were
told that the International Court at The
Hague would settle substantive difficul-
ties.
The plebiscite will be taken on January
13, 1935. A committee will supervise it
—a Swiss district commissioner, a
Dutch railway engineer who used to be
Mayor of Samarang (Java), a Swedish
provincial Governor. They are to have
the help of a lady technical expert—
Miss Wambaugh (U.S.A.), “delegate of
the Peruvian Government in the prepara-
tion of the Tacna-Arica plebiscite.” After
the vote is taken, there will be a transi-
tion period of a year, with the League
still in the saddle.
Hitler has withdrawn his Nazis, being
presumably certain that the vote will
now go his way. The French have a
strong force close to the frontier in case
he tries a putsch.
Meanwhile, the most silent person on
the antheap—and the firmest, too —is
Geoffrey George Knox, who learnt
his guile from a long training in
the Near East and got his firm jaw from
the vicinity of Bellevue Hill, Sydney.
The eyes of the world will be on this
Australian during the next few months.
He will not disgrace his native land.


PLAIN ENGLISH.
W. A. Holman’s Memoirs.
Next week The Bulletin will begin
publication of striking chapters selected
from W. A. Holman’s story of the rise
and fall of Labor in N. S. Wales —the
complete book will be published by the
Endeavour Press.
For ten years —1910 to 1920 —Holman
was outstanding in N.S.W. State politics.
He organised the Labor movement out of
chaos; to chaos it reverted when he left
it. In these memoirs he indicates some
of the influences which tainted the
party’s domestic councils in his day;
readers may judge for themselves
whether or not similar influences are at
work still.
Holman was much more than a party
man. The possessor of a first-class legal
mind, he was responsible chiefly for the
State Court of Criminal Appeal and for
the consolidation of the statutes, and
when the war came he proved that a
good Australian can be a good Imperial-
ist. Holman was big, however you
looked at him, and his story is interest-
ing and significant as showing how many
men of his calibre the Labor movement
produced in its prime.
•
Discriminating Against Australians.
A. M. Hemsley, one of the legal mem-
bers of the N.S.W. Leg. Council, stated
in the House that, in the case of a tax-
payer returning £lOO of British income,
4s. 6d. in the £ is deducted at the source
for British income tax and the N.S.W.
Taxation Department exacts lOd. in the
£ on £125 for “special” income tax, the
£25 being in respect of exchange. “I
am giving hon. members an actual case,”
he said. He had to explain later
that he had “unintentionally misled the
House.”
I find that the authorities here tax on
the £77 10s., not on the £lOO, and they
also tax the exchange on £77 10s., not on
£lOO.
In effect, the swindle is not so outrage-
ous as the amiable Mr. Hemsley thought
it was. It is, of course, a swindle to
impose any State tax on income taxed
abroad, and one which the swindling
State pays for in loss of population. It
is a flagrant infraction of the arrange-
ment between the British and Australian
Governments whereby, as the “Daily
Mail” Year-Book puts it, “an allowance
may be claimed of tax on doubly-
charged income at half the appropriate
British rate or at the Dominion rate —
whichever is the lower.”
But in one respect the explanation
places the department in a worse light
than before. In taxing income from
abroad, it' does not touch what the over-
seas taxgatherers have deducted. In tax-
ing income from other States, it does
touch what has been taken in the State
of origin and in the Commonwealth;
in other words, it charges lOd. in the £
on what has been paid in taxes (four,
as a rule) to the State of origin and the
Commonwealth. Hundreds of N. S.
Wales residents can testify to this;
scores can bear witness that 10 p.c.
fines have been added to the tax
on tax-money. The whole thing is in-
famous ; but the law is rotten; the de-
partment is permitted to make arbitrary
decisions, and it discriminates (instinc-
tively, as it were) against Australians.

The “Honors” Ramp.
Nothing could be more degrading than
the scramble for “honors” which takes
place when a member of the royal family
comes to Australia. Decorations for
valor are legitimate—every country has
them —but the sight of Australians dele-
gated to make a distinguished visitor’s
stay pleasant struggling for gee-gaws
some of which were invented to
feed the vanity of palace flunkeys in
a snobbish age is repugnant to decent
Australian citizens. So is the specula-
tion which goes on about the matter in
the flapper press.
African negro chiefs and babu civil
servants get minor knighthoods in these
days. So much is the overseas “honors”
system held in contempt in London that
“colonial” goats are separated from
home merinos when the lists are pub-
lished. Canada long ago abandoned the
practice of recommending citizens for
titles. South Africa scorns it. And the
notion that Lloyd George, Stanley Bald-
win or Ramsay MacDonald would take
a K.B.E. or a K.C.V.O. is as ridiculous
as that they should appear in Whitehall
dressed in sarongs and daubed with kopi.
Australia is always glad to see a
member of the royal family. The visit
of the Duke of Gloucester has been a
distinct success. In dedicating Victoria’s
Shrine of Remembrance (“this noble
shrine”) he spoke felicitous words with
real feeling. It will be a dreadful descent
from this splendid ceremony to a distri-
bution of vulgar gauds made in the spirit
in which tips are handed by English
visitors to country-house butlers.

Griffin, Kisch and Garden.
The Commonwealth Government has
spent a busy week keeping out of Aus-
tralia “anti-war” strangers who wished
to lecture and attend conferences here.
A Mr. Griffin, from Maoriland, failed
to speak Dutch and was turned back. He
is an agitator of no consequence who
apparently uses anti-war movements as a
cloak for Red international propaganda.
Had he been allowed into the Common-
wealth only a few convinced Commun-
ists and pacifist old ladies who do not
understand the real aims of the com-
pany which they keep would have heard
his views. Now he is a martyr, and
when he speaks his mind even the “Syd-
ney Morning Herald” will report him.
At Fremantle, another delegate was
barred —Herr Egon Kisch. Herr Kisch
modestly describes himself as an “author
of international renown,” and says he is
deeply shocked, because he has hitherto
been welcomed in every country which
he has visited. Professor Murdoch
(Perth) agrees with him. He thinks that
Australia has disgraced herself, and Pro-
fessor Beasley remarks that it is “a sorry
compliment to the intelligence of the
Australian people that they cannot be
trusted to think for themselves.” But
Herr Kisch is definitely prohibited—he
wasn’t even given a dictation test in an
obscure language because he might have
passed it.
Any country has the right to refuse
its hospitality to persons who may abuse
it. But it is utterly inconsistent to ex-
clude Mr. Griffin and Herr Kisch and to
admit Mr. Garden to the Australian
Parliament without a challenge.

V.D.
N. S. Wales Minister for Health Weaver
to the Racial Hygiene Association:
Unless we combine to fight, with all
scientific and material resources, the grow-
ing menace of venereal disease, Australia’s
healthy climate, beaches and freedom from
the plagues of Asia will not save the
community from a slow and lingering .
national ill-health.
The Bulletin said it first just 21 years
ago. Since then the mortality from t.b. has
been reduced throughout the Common-
wealth by about 50 per cent. Typhoid
has been virtually wiped out in the cities,
and the cases elsewhere only amount to
a few hundreds yearly. The same with
diphtheria. The infantile death-rate has
dropped from over 100 to under 40 per
1000. During the war the incidence of
v.d. in the British and Dominions armies
in France was brought down to one half
of one per cent. —incidentally, the A.E.F.
by employing the same disciplinary and
prophylactic measures, achieved the same
high standard of immunity. In Australia
to-day v.d. in all its forms appears to be
as prevalent as ever.
When the Bulletin first began dis-
cussing this horror in plain language—
and it was the first lay paper in the Eng-
lish-speaking world to do so —it sub-
mitted that v.d. was different from
diseases like typhoid and t.b. inasmuch
as it couldn’t be localised. It is as per-
vasive as the Black Death. In other words,
the business of coping with it is a national
rather than a State matter. So long as
one part of the Australian mainland
elected to remain unclean it would be
useless for the other parts to submit to
the stern discipline of disinfection. But
if the Commonwealth, as a whole, did
make up its mind to eliminate v.d. (“the
father and mother of diseases”), then the
thing could be done almost as easily as
it was in most of the Allied armies. It
might provide the cure for cancer; it
certainly would provide this island-con-
tinent with the healthiest and most beau-
tiful aggregation of human beings that
civilisation has known.
There are two lions in the path: (1)
the “v.d. vote”; (2) the fanatics who
argue that it is better for the innocent to
suffer than for the sinful to be saved from
heaven’s vengeance. They represent for-
midable obstacles, but they could be got
over provided the right kind of citizens,
male and female, decided to put patriot-
ism and humanity before false shame.
An All-Australian ’Plane.
A very earnest and determined en-
deavor was made in Sydney to put an
Australian-made ’plane in the Milden-
hall-Melbourne air race, and that it
failed was no fault of the projectors.
The story of the effort is worth telling,
very briefly, so that interest may be
stimulated in a project that may have
an important bearing on the Common-
wealth’s future in flying.
About 12 months ago L. R. J. Jones,
who teaches aeronautical subjects at East
Sydney Tech., conceived the notion of
representing Australia in the race. He took
a design for a fast, small, light two-seater
machine to T. D. J. Leech, of Sydney
Uni. Engineering School, whose hobby is
aeronautics, and invited his assistance in
getting such a ’plane built. It was a
two-seater monoplane with a skeleton
fuselage, of a smaller wing-span than any
machine that actually started in the race.
Specification called for two 130-h.p.
motors, and it was estimated that the
craft, whose ratios of weight-over-wing
and weight-over-horsepower were lower
even than those of the Douglas, would
have a top speed of 195 m.p.h. and a
cruising radius of 1500 miles.
A certain amount of financial support
was promised; Messrs. Jones and Leech
put into the enterprise every penny they
could, and construction was commenced.
Finance was an ever-present source of
worry, and defective parts caused serious
delays, but the machine was at last got
together, all save the engines. It had
been decided to have these made in Aus-
tralia, but a manufacturer with whom a
contract was made discovered that he
could not guarantee that they would be
certified by the Australian authority as
safe for a flight three miles from an
aerodrome, so an order had to be placed
in England.
Cable advice was received that first
one engine and then the other had been
completed and shipped, in just about time
to enable the machine to compete in the
race. Three weeks later came another
cablegram stating that the second engine
by some blunder had not been shipped,
and was still at the docks. So that con-
tract was cancelled, time being its
essence.
An entry in the race was impossible,
but it was hoped to complete the ’plane,
to test its possibilities as a fighting-type,
for which it seems admirably suited, and
to use it for research purposes to obtain
the data that must be gleaned before such
types of aeroplane can be constructed
in this country. The ’plane now lies
engineless, the promotors are threatened
with the bankruptcy of their little com-
pany and the loss of their machine. They
had bad luck. Theirs was a patriotic
and public-spirited enterprise, and it
should not be allowed to crash in utter
failure.

On the Rubicon.
Seven years ago when J. T. Lang em-
braced J. S. Garden and became god-
father to extremist Labor, the “Worker”
declared that Mr. Lang had definitely
become one of the Reds and “crossed the
Rubicon.” This year has discovered him
shivering on the bank.
The A.R.U., which admired him so
much a few years ago that its leaders
called at the Premier’s office and pre-
sented him with a wireless set, has
affiliated with the Red International. A
campaign to elect R.I. officials to lead-
ing positions is being pushed among
members of the Tramwaymen’s Union.
The coalminers once were Mr. Lang’s
strongest support. Last year the northern
branch elected the secretary of the
Minority Movement and one of his
supporters to their principal offices, and
the ballot' for the general presidency
and secretaryship of the Miners’
Federation resolved itself into a contest
between Langsters and the Minority
Movement. The great man went to the
field himself to plead the cause of his
nominees—his local henchman, Mr. Bad-
deley, showed himself modest and self-
effacing to an unusual degree—and was
greeted with demands for information
about the £36,000 which the federation
had put behind the “Labor Daily” and
the £3OOO-odd which it had advanced to
the A.L.P. executive to meet costs in
the Bailey-Willis libel case.
Their own lodge repudiated Mr. Lang’s
candidates, and they went down horribly.
His nominee for the presidency was
beaten by nearly 2 to 1, his nominee for
the secretaryship by over 2to 1. In
each case, the M.M. man has a clear
majority over all other candidates. It is
a bad business for Goulburn-street, but
the public at least knows where it is.
The Selfish Australian.
“We have taxed our people in order to
give preference to the Dominions, who
have responded with practically prohibi-
tive tariffs against British imports,” cried
Lord Snowden at a Cobden Club lun-
cheon last week. Which remark only
shows how far Freetrade fanaticism can
carry away a man naturally well-bal-
anced, and make him behave like a
dancing Dervish who has partaken of an
overdose of hashish.
The yarn about the selfish Australian
who gets everything from England and
gives nothing to it is so frequently
repeated that careless citizens, both Eng-
lish and Australian, may come to believe
it. Customs Minister White has placed
the facts on record.
Lord Snowden made no mention of
Australia having given preferences to
Britain to the extent of 10 to 15 million
pounds’ worth of goods annually for the
25 years prior to the Ottawa Agreement.
Neither did he refer to the fact that nearly
100 items of British manufacture are
admitted duty-free. Nor did he wax
eloquent because Australia, next to
India, is the best customer that Britain
has, although Australia has a popula-
tion of only 6\ millions and India has
one of 300 to 400 millions.
As White pointed out, during the 11
years 1922-32 Australia bought from
Britain goods valued at 537 millions,
while Britain, the sufferer from the brutal
selfishness of the Commonwealth, spent
less than 472 millions on Australia’s
products. During the same period
Britain gave the Argentine a favorable
balance of 434 millions and Denmark
one of 410 millions.

Synthetic Efficiency.
Victorian surveyors assert that un-
licensed practitioners are. competing
briskly with them and that people are
unsuspectingly paying for plans which
may lead to litigation and confusion.
The licensed surveyors have a good case
in appealing for better protection of the
public, though people who gamble on
the capacity of an outsider deserve little
sympathy. The difficulty is to secure
this protection. The existing law seems
drastic enough to stamp out any such
practices; to obtain proof of them is
another pair of sleeves.
The same thing occurs in Australia in
other professions. There is the Gent. One
who, having been struck off the roll, be-
comes, nominally, a clerk in the office
of a qualified man of little ability or
much drink. There is the qualified medi-
cal man who stands in with the quack.
And many a man has a tooth pulled by
an unregistered man, believing that the
operator is the person whose name
appears on the brass plate.
All these practices are prohibited by
law, but so hard are they to prove that
it is only on occasions that somebody
slips in his tactics and is made to toe
the mark, charged with unprofessional
conduct. Obviously, greater vigilance on
the administrative side is necessary if the
standard of ability is to be maintained
and the public prevented from being
swindled.

Progress in Papua.
“Susu”: It surely will not be long before
the natives of Papua will be demanding
a vote, all-same white pfeller. Lieut.-
Gov. Murray reports that they have long
since learnt to pick the locks of hand-
cuffs and legirons, and that even Yale
locks have become practically useless,
since some ingenious coon devised a
picker from the key of a meat-tin.
Village councils are having much suc-
cess ; although the chairman of the local
government authority at Milne Bay in-
sists on presiding in a lady’s imitation
black-straw hat, it is no more ridiculous
than the headgear affected by Lord
Mayors. Some municipal resolutions are
far ahead of most white-pfeller parochial
activities. For example, the ancient prac-
tice of abandoning a village whenever
a pig dies has been discarded in Milne
Bay as inconvenient and out of date.
Another council dealt in no uncertain
way with one of their burghers who
ignored demands for tidying up his
premises. He was voted a flogging, with
the addenda of having his hair cut short
and his armshells taken away, and the
Executive saw that the resolution was
carried out. A further vote of three
months in the local lock-up was only
negatived by an unsympathetic R.M.
If a similar high standard of civic-
mindedness could be developed in Aus-
tralia the zymotic-disease figures would
go down with a bump.

"AND IT'S PRINTED WITH WIMBLE'S INKS"
“Val”: We had been arguing for quite
a while about the correct pronunciation
of “centenary” without arriving at any
definite conclusion when the American
sailor, who had so far only been a lis-
tener, drained his pot and joined in: “See
here, buddies,” he said. “You
English have gaht a language
and don’t know how to use it.
Now take clerk” “Clark,
we call that here,” interposed
Joe. “Sure you do,” said Yank,
“but jest because you guys have
been doing it for so long ain’t
no cause why we should go ahn
pronouncing woids different
frahm what they’re written.”
“Yes, but dark was correct Eng-
lish before Columbus ever
found America,” somebody pro-
tested. “Oh, yeah! ” said Yank.
“But where I come frahm a
dark is a thing kept in ahn
ahfice to show the clerk when
to nahk ahf.” The clock in the bar struck
six. “Taime, gentlemen, please,” said
Miss Goldilocks.

“G.M.”: On Cup Eve the electricity
failed in the Prahran (Vic.) area while
an operation was in progress at Alfred
Hospital. The nurses commandeered
all the torches in the institution within
a few seconds, and the op. was finished
safely. But the incident provides a warn-
ing for the future. All operating theatres
should be provided with adjunct installa-
tions for use in case of emergency. The
cost would be trifling; sufficient light
could be obtained from an ordinary car
battery to see the trouble through.

“E. and P.”: “Friction Tube” must
have remarkable eyesight if he can see
a mob of “Royal Garrison Artillery” at
Victoria Barracks, Sydney, any day (B.
31/10/’34). There is no such unit in
Australia. Once upon a time there was
a P.F. unit known as the “Royal Austra-
lian Garrison Artillery.” Later it be-
came the “Royal Australian Artillery,”
of which the Ist Field Cadre is stationed
at V.B. There is a militia unit specialis-
ing in coast gunnery which has the title
“Australian Garrison Artillery,” but it
is not a royal regiment.
“Gypsos”: The “Unclaimed Fund” of
the Commonwealth Savings Bank, re-
cently published, disclosed the existence
of some 1700 absent-minded people
whose accounts have apparently ceased
to interest them. A Sydney depositor
heads the list with £439 15s. 2d.; a resi-
dent of Cairns comes second with £3BB
3s. lOd. There are many accounts ex-
ceeding £lOO, and tenners, twenties and
thirties are frequent. The war days are
brought to mind by two of the items.
At Yea, the Anti-Conscription League
owns £9 7s. 4d., and the sergeants’ mess,
24th Army M.C., Toowoomba, has a
credit balance of £1 13s. lOd.

“Findy”: At a recent “search for
screen-types” in Sydney a hopeful young
blonde who visualised herself out-Garbo-
ing Dietrich turned up for her “audi-
lion.” Face and figure scored full points.
Then came the voice test, and with it
stage-fright. The damsel, unable to recall
a single word of the powerful dramatic
passage she had selected for her pass-
port to Hollywood, stood dumbly in
front of the microphone. “Say any-
thing,” said the director. “I can’t,” she
stammered. “I’ve forgotten it.” Then,
“Shall I recite?” Bidden to go ahead,
the aspirant for world fame racked her
brains a moment, and then began the
only piece she knew. It was probably
the first time the mike had ever heard
Tennyson’s “Brook,” but it stood up to
it manfully.

“G. Trotter”: The suggestion to deck
“Mary’s Rock,” near Eugowra (N.S.W.),
with a neck-to-knee costume, because it
bears some resemblance to a nude dam-
sel, recalls the surprising fact that even
Rome possessed a cult of wowsers. Some
40 years ago a fountain was erected in
the circus facing the railway station, and
around the fountain appeared four
groups of naked ladies, ordinary, con-
ventional nudes. But as soon as they
were disclosed such a loud squeal arose
from the wowsers that the city fathers
hastened to drape the figures in scanties
and brassieres, or some such equivalent.
Alderman’s Wife: “Shall I send for our own doctor or call for tenders?”
This was too much for the artistic Latin
nature; a mob of outraged painters and
sculptors and students and patrons of
the fine arts tore the offending garments
from the bronze beauties and defied the
authorities to take action. The authori-
ties capitulated, and to-day the tourist
may linger to admire the full beauty of
the sculptor’s work.

“Outback”: Queer accidents? During
our weekly hop the other night one
couple stopped suddenly midway down
the old pine floor. It took a chisel to
free the girl’s foot from the pine splinter
that had sprung from one of the boards.
The shaft had gone right through the
shoe, stocking and well into the foot.
But after the local medico had extracted
it the lass was none the worse and never
missed a dance.

“Mad-ox”: The landing of a big sweep
prize not infrequently proves a curse in-
stead of a blessing. Take the case of a
carefree Queensland sanitary-man—or
-boy, he was little more —who won
£6OOO. His good fortune brought him
hosts of friends, and although he
neither drank nor gambled his money
soon took wings. He bought motor-
cars, dabbled in house property,
financed a butchering business, and at
the end of 12 months found himself
back in his job as a sanitary-man, but
carefree no longer. His vanished money
had created a peck of troubles for him,
and just before a court case in which he
was to appear he attempted to board a
moving train, fell between two trucks
and was killed.
“C.E.D.”: Recent pars, concerning the
jumbling of infants remind me of a mix-
up for which I was responsible when, as
a kid of 10, I had been relieved of my
tonsils in a city hospital in England. Being
convalescent, I was requisitioned by an
overworked nurse to dress a boy and a
girl—each of about half my own age—
who were about to be handed over to
their natural custodians. The boy’s out-
fit' I managed tolerably well, but the
mysteries of feminine wear had me
puzzled. However, I did the best I could.
The mothers were waiting as the three
of us came down from the wards, and
duly received their respective infants.
After a little intensive study both of
them gave tongue. “Oh, dear!” said the
first, “this can’t be my little boy!” The
other took a firmer stand. “This is not
my little girl! ” she declared emphatically.
Subesquent analysis proved that I’d
dressed them in the wrong clothes!

“Light Division”: How did “G.M.”
get it into his nut (B. 7/11/’34) that the
surrender of Hougoumont chateau, one
of Wellington’s key positions at Water-
loo, was a feature of the battle? In
spite of unending attacks throughout the
day, the chateau, garrisoned by a com-
posite force of Guards and German rifle-
men, held fast to the bitter end. The suc-
cessful defence of Hougoumont by an
inferior force against overwhelming odds
is one of the bright spots in English
military history.

“Oxmead”: Calverley wrote some
delightful verses about young women
scrambling wildly for the cherry-stones
left on the plate of the Prince of Wales
(Edward VII. to be) after a banquet in
which fruit-tart had figured on the menu.
One of the successful scramblers was
made to express herself, as nearly as I
can remember, in the following ecstatic
lines:
One large one—at the moment
It seemed almost divine—
Was grabbed by that Miss Beaumont,
And three —oh, three! —are mine.
King Edward’s grandson attended Hen-
ley regatta in Melbourne, and on leaving,
according to a newspaper account,
He casually flicked the butt of his cigar-
ette away and stepped into his car, uncon-
scious of the scramble of beautiful Henley
girls to secure the precious bumper as a
souvenir... .Several young women, wild-
eyed and triumphant, emerged from the
ruck, each bearing a cigarette butt.
Obviously human nature hasn’t altered
much since mid-Victorian times. The
only difference is that the cherry-stones
pictured by Calverley had all “dallied
with the teeth of royalty itself,” whereas
no one will ever know which of the
Henley souvenir-hunters secured the
genuine gasper.

“Bangemall”: There were few things
of which old John Forrest was prouder
than of being a native of the seaport
town of Bunbury, and his allusions to his
place of origin (which had also sent him
to Parliament and kept him there) were
so frequent that' some Westralian news-
paper satirically christened it “The Birth-
place,” and the name stuck. On the
goldfields the stout old Premier’s ten-
dency to drag Bunbury into his speeches
became a stock joke, and if nothing was
heard on the subject irrelevant interjec-
tions would supply the omission. “You’ve
forgotten something,” a humorist would
chip in when John had been expounding
his ideas of equitable mining laws .or
dilating on all he had done for the gold-
fields ; “you’ve told us nothing about
Bunbury.” It was at a meeting at
Kanowna on one scorching summer night
that Forrest, goaded beyond endurance
at persistent references to his pet obses-
sion, turned irritably on one of his tor-
mentors. “Let Bunbury alone,” he
barked; “you’d be a lucky man if you
were there.” The interjector, his flannel
streaked with sweat and the red dust of
the goldfields, paused for a moment be-
fore he contributed the soft answer that
turns away wrath. “Well, I could get a
wash anyhow,” he conceded. After the
laughter had subsided John was suffered
to finish his harangue in peace.

“Davrich”: Apropos of comprehen-
sively informative signs and mixed call-
ings (B. 7/11 /’34), most Diggers who
visited Cairo will remember the shop in
a side-street that displayed a notice-
board reading:
Funerals done.
Meals are of the Tip Top.
Photergrafs took at your best looking send
this one in your Australias.
Haircutting at the back and not lousy flore.
Teeth will come out no pain for little charge.
Whisky can tell were and riebuck.
I elicited from the Gyppo proprietor that
he was agent for the various businesses
mentioned, and that an obliging Digger
had drawn up and executed the sign.

“Brummell”: Making public his reason
for not going to a dinner given by the
G.-G., Ogilvie, of Tasmania, explained
that he had only brought “tails” and
accessories from the Speck, and found he
was expected to wear a dinner jacket.
Fearing that his dress-suit' would make
him unduly conspicuous, he withdrew.
Somehow it recalls a remark attributed lo
Mark Twain when, on a visit to London,
he went to a Buckingham Palace ball
and found something very distasteful in
the spectacle of the U.S. Minister to
Britain moving about in sober black
among a blaze of brilliant uniforms of
every color. Mark said it reminded him
of nothing so much as a lost Presby-
terian in hell.
“Buckshi Sahib”: It is easy
to raise trouble in India. Re-
cently the Punjab Government
announced in the Gazette that
it had acquired a stud donkey
for the stock department at Gur-
gaon and that the beast would
be known as Ahmad. This is
one of the Hundred Names of
Allah, and delighted Hindus
asked what the Moslem com-
munity was going to do about
it. Islam retorted in the usual
manner, and, after troops had
cleaned up the mess, the press
and the local Parliament took
up the matter. It was then
explained that the donk’s given name
was really Ahmak, which means a fool
or something to that effect, and that a
careless compositor had made the regret-
table error.

“Second Divvy”: In Sydney Central
Summons Court a few days ago a de-
fending lawyer “was not satisfied that a
Crown witness was entitled to be ad-
dressed as ‘captain.’ ”
Mr. May (the magistrate): What does
it matter?
The answer is “a great deal”; and not only
to ex-soldiers. A country full of persons
who use military titles to which they
are not entitled (and that includes allow-
ing others to apply military titles to them
without correction) becomes a subject for
derision. Witness the deadly use Dickens
made of America’s “colonels” and “gen-
erals” in “Martin Chuzzlewit.” Militia
officers, ex-members of the A.I.F. and
suchlike have no right to their service
titles ; if it were otherwise absurd situa-
tions would arise. One of the writer’s
comrades in France returned a lieut.-
colonel (D.S.O. and bar) to the job he
had held when he enlisted —sar’-major in
a “regular” artillery unit! In law he
had no right to put up his D.S.O. (it
being an officers’ decoration”), but the
authorities got over that by making him
a subaltern. Civilian V.Cs. are nearly
always credited with their honor in the
press and elsewhere. Why not Mr.
Brown, M.C.; Mr. Smith, D.C.M., etc.?
The owners of war decorations were only
soldiers “for the duration,” but it was
never intended that their awards should
be temporary.

“Jobber”: About those small news-
papers (B. 31/10/’34). The tiniest I ever
struck was fastened to a notice-board in
a communication trench on Gallipoli.
It was called the “Peninsular Press” and
was produced by a Tommy mob on the
beach. No one being in sight at the time,
I whipped it inside my shirt and posted it
home by the next mail. It reached its
destination, although for some unascer-
tainable reason the censor had cut out
the date. I didn’t carry a rule about
in those days, and I can’t measure
it now because it is, with my other sou-
venirs, in the War Museum.
YOU TWO.
Here’s luck, you two! I don't know why you
waited
So desperately long to coalesce,
Save for a mild distrust (reciprocated),
A certain lack of reasonableness.
It seems a bit of resolute endeavor
Might very well have hurried on the clock.
But, none the less, it’s better late than never.
Here’s luck then, Joe and Doc.!
Let _ party dog-fights fade into the farness!
It’s up to you to show us, Earle, old man,
That you can trot with Joe in double harness
As equably as once you did with Stan.
If Ramsay Mac. and Baldwin deep can bury
The hatchet —Smuts and sombre Hertzog,
too —
Pro bono publico, it should be very
Much easier for you.
Here’s luck, you two! Whatever hopes are
blighted
Thereby, I see no reason, none at all,
Why you should fail to stay and stand, united,
Who, split in snarling factions, needs must
fall.
And, now that Urbs and Rus once more are
brothers,
Is it too much to counsel that you seize
The opportunity to mend each other’s
Patent deficiencies?
Your native combativeness, Doc., restricted,
Would be a less prolific source of feuds;
And, Joe, you rank as overmuch addicted
To stodgy truisms and platitudes.
You’re patriots both, deservedly commended
As amiable beings, well we know.
But each may taste more palatable blended.
Here’s luck then, Doc. and Joe!

T. THE R.


“10-2-4”: A contributor to the “S. M.
Herald” who visited Leningrad last
summer was severe on the women’s
clothes:
One undergarment seemed adequate, and
corsets, from appearances, were a perquisite
of the bourgeoise. One woman, standing
near us in an art gallery, had on a black
frock of the jersey-silk variety and one
undergarment.
A Russian who visited Sydney in the
summer and made the necessary inves-
tigations would probably find that one
undergarment and no corsets were the
fashion from Bellevue Hill to the ’Loo.
Picture the scene, however, if the tra-
veller made a test of the matter on the
person of a strange Sydney female in the
Domain gallery! The local equivalent
of the O.G.P.U. would soon be on the
job, and the “S. M. Herald” would be
the first to call for severe action against
the prying Bolshevik.

“M.G.”: References to the hanging of
women recall that until the middle ’nine-
ties only one of the sex had suffered such
a fate in Victoria. She was Mrs. Scott,
of Beechworth, who had murdered
her husband, and she attained some
notoriety by refusing, after conviction,
to mount the steps of Black Maria
because they were so high that she
would have to show her legs to
the populace. The police were sym-
pathetic, and brought a gin-case to pre-
serve the lady’s modesty. Thirty years
passed before Mrs. Knorr was hanged.
She had adopted babies for a fiver apiece
and buried them, strangled, in the back-
yards of various houses she had occu-
pied around Melbourne. The hanging
of Mrs. Knorr was dramatic, in that
Jones, the executioner, who had turned
off many a mere male, cut his throat the
night before the appointed day because
the idea of hanging a woman jarred on
his susceptibilities. His place was taken
by an ex-policeman, alleged to be an old
English public-schoolboy, who had no
“That big brute called we a cow!”
“What sort of cow?”
such qualms, and who turned off the
murderess with dexterity. Within a year
he had hanged two more women—Mrs.
Needle, who had poisoned her husband,
her lover and her two children, and
Emma Williams who, for financial rea-
sons, had tied a stone round her four-
year-old’s neck and cast him into Port
Melbourne lagoon. All three were ex-
tremely gross cases, with no extenuating
circumstances.
“Lond”: Grant Richards, publisher
and author, too, tells in his new book of
reminiscences a pretty story of a brush
George Moore had in 1897 with Andrew
Lang. That stylist had criticised an
article of Moore’s. The novelist replied
by telling the “Saturday Review,” with-
out any comment, an incident of his own
recent visit to a fishing village in Scot-
land. Said the landlady, “We have had
Mr. Andrew Lang staying here. He is
a beautiful fisherman.” “Does he catch,
much?” “No, sir, he never catches any-
thing—but he fishes beautifully!”
“D.”: The Duke of Glou-
cester has a pull over some
of the other visiting celeb-
rities. The flapper papers
have refrained so far from
calling him “Glossy,” and he
hasn’t had to endure being
slimed with familiarity in
other directions. I yield to
nobody in my admiration for
the feats of Kingsford Smith,
Scott and the rest, but the
spectacle of hundreds of re-
porters and reporterines who
have never so much, as seen
a world-flier writing of them
as “Smithy,” “Scotty” and so
on has put me off the heroes.
It may be illogical, but I
have a feeling that these
idols of the public are in
some way to blame for the
fulsome business. Men seem
to get the impudence they
deserve. Apropos, an oaf in
a Melbourne crowd (possibly
one of the very journalists
who have been making so
free with the fliers’ names)
yelled at the Duke, “How’s
Teddy?” I doubt if this man
would have yelled “How’s
Glossy?” at the Prince. The
Duke has a manner which
says more plainly than words
that he doesn’t want any
nicknames from strangers.
“Spare Sawbones”: I can go one better
than “Bank Clerk” (B. 24/10/’34). I
have a cheque-book issued by an Aus-
tralian bank in 1927 which measures 6in.
by a shade over 3in; the whole could
easily be folded into the waistcoat
pocket. They were more a nuisance than
a convenience, however, there being
barely space for the writer of a flowing
hand to get in all the essentials. Also,
the cheques, once detached, had all the
elusiveness of a mislaid postage stamp.
They were in general use in my district
at the time, and still turn up occasion-
ally, even in these days when cockies’
cheques are becoming rarer and rarer.*

“O. Ren”: Following on a recent Bul-
letin discussion, I maintain that not only
different races but different countries
have their own characteristic odors.
France, for example, has a distinctive
heavy, musky smell, something between
the hum of strong toffee and pigs. Jt
affects me so strongly that I picked it
up a mile off Boulogne or Calais, and it
takes weeks to get used to it. I have
sometimes wondered whether it has
anything to do with French methods
of cultivation ; but these differ little from
English methods, whereas the smell of
England is quite different, more subtle
and harder to describe—strong Devon-
shire cream on slightly-burnt toast is as
near as I can manage. Everyone who
has passed that way knows the smells of
Port Said, but it is absurd to ascribe all
that weight of odor to the natives and
the drains. None of the drains and only
a proportion of the natives pursue one
into the desert, where the smell is just
as fixed. Southern Italy and Sicily have
their special effluvium ; it is rather like
Australia’s. As one lands at Fremantle
or Sydney your nose will always tell
you that you are home again.
“Under the circumstances, Henry, the only thing 1 can suggest is
a game of tennis.”
“Turl”: Speaking at a temperance
shivoo, Archbishop Head, of Melbourne,
recalled that “when I was a young don
I enjoyed a glass of port, but when I
became a parson in a poor part of Lon-
don and saw the harm that drink was
doing in the home I immediately gave
up my glass of port.” In my undergradu-
ate days it would have taken more than
a Pauline injunction to make the average
Oxford or Cambridge don forswear his
common-room stimulants; there was
even a venerable head of one venerable
college, a massive scholar at that, who
was known as “Port Wine B ,” and
whose nose bore cogent evidence to the
aptness of his sobriquet. In my own
college the chaplain, an equally worthy
and popular old soul, had the reputation,
deserved or not, of being a three-bottle
man. He was a keen sportsman, too,
who made a point of hunting two or
three days a week, and who frequently
appeared at evening chapel with his
riding-breeches and -boots only imper-
fectly concealed by his surplice. That
was over 40 years ago—-I suspect the
modern tribe of dons has to pay more
regard to appearances.

“Centurion”: Knocking back the
popular view that the Australian soldier
was lacking in discipline and smartness,
Howard-Vyse, now in
Australia with the Duke,
but once C.O.S. to Harry
Chauvel, told a Melbourne
audience recently that the
Light Horsemen in parti-
cular could hold their
own in both respects with
any soldier he knew. As
a matter of fact, when the
Duke of Connaught
visited Palestine in 1918
he was amazed by the
trim and perfect turnout
of the regiments he in-
spected. A sports meet-
ing was being held at the
same time, and a high
British officer advised the
cutting out of the contest
for the smartest regimen-
tal transport, since the
casual Australians would
not have a chance with the British regi-
ments. Todd, of Westralia, insisted, and
won from the whole of the army in
Palestine with his 10th L.H. turnout.

“Ibn el Issar”: I read with intense in-
terest the mention (B. 31/10/’34) of a
“Rajah’s guest-house seraglio.” I am
aware India has altered much since 1
knew a little of it, but I hardly expected
such radical changes as this. There
were guest-houses maintained by the
Native Princes then, but they were in-
variably well outside the environs of the
palace, and consisted of a few bare rooms
with a dirty khansamah in charge. The
occupants were generally Europeans
waiting for H.H. to settle the bills of
the Calcutta or Bombay firms they
represented. Of seraglio or anderun
there was no si g n - It is unlikely I shall
vlslt Hin . d . a S ain - , AU the same 1 shall be

would send me the address of that very
liberal-minded Native potentate,

“T.P.”: “Rokko’s” yarn (B. 31/10 / ’34)
of a childhood scare permeating a long
life is based on sound premises. When
a nipper I was taken by a teacher to a
dam. After 10 minutes’ instructions in
the shallows he left me dog-paddling
cheerily in deeper water, remarking that
I was plainly “a natural swimmer” and
he’d finish me off in “another lesson or
two.” Hardly was his back turned
when Plugger Mick wrapped his
arms and legs around my body, sank
with me thrice, then hauled me,
a quivering sobbing bundle of terror,
to the bank. Sixty years later I can’t
put head and shoulders under water, even
in a plunge-bath, without a definite effort
of will. The only precious memory of
the business that I retain is Plugger’s
howling when the dominie flailed him.
Not having a stitch on him he got the full
strength of every blow, and chalk-and-
dusterers hit hard in those primitive days.
•I’ 'i*
“Exon”: “The Silent Navy” has a very
efficient publicity “blah” machine now-
adays. It broke me up, as a soldier of
some experience, to read in a Sydney daily
that when the R.N. makes its great land-
ing display in Sydney in connection with
Prince Henry’s visit, the unique oppor-
tunity is to be given civilians of seeing the
King’s color displayed, bystanders being
enjoined to salute it. Every infantry
regiment in the British Army carries a
King’s color as well as the regimental
one. These colors are plastered with the
names of battles that the Navy has never
heard of —the cathedrals and churches
of England are draped with them. When-
ever the King’s color is displayed in a
parade or march past, even of the most
unconsidered regiment, it is saluted with
full honors, and civilians are expected
to follow suit.

“F.I.A.T.’s” scheme:
If I were Dictator I would engage to save the
lives of about 300 citizens (a few old and
doddering, the rest young) who, under present
conditions, are doomed to die yearly on the
public highways. As follows: Penalty for
push-cyclist found riding at night without a
“bright white light in front” and a “red re-
flector not less than two inches in diameter”
behind (see any State Traffic Act), six months’
hard labor. Penalty for pedestrian found walk-
ing on a concrete speedway by night or day
with back to oncoming traffic, six months’ hard
labor. Penalty for motorist convicted of driving
to the public danger (e.g., speeding past inter-
sections or near schools; cutting in recklessly;
speeding round corners), six Snonths’ hard labor
and permanent deprivation of license. No
children under five to be allowed near a car-
frequented road after dark, and children over
five to be systematically instructed in road
dangers and how to avoid them. My scheme
would no doubt cause the gaols to be con-
gested for a while (though no more 'so than
in Italy when Mussolini was stamping out
Communism, or than in Russia when the Com-
munists were stamping out Czarism), but aitei
that jay-walkers should become as rare as
capitalists who leave fortunes unprotected,
motor-hogs as rare as burglars, if not mur-
derers.
CRUISE-FEVER.
(With apologies to the Poet Laureate.)
I must go down to the seas again, in seaich
of a bit o’ fun,
And all I ask is a liner of thirty thousand ton,
And plate-glass, and saloon-bars, and cocktails
shaking, , .
And cinemas, and swimming pools, and bare
backs baking.
I must go off on a cruise again, for the way
of a luxury ship
Is the way for a man with time on his hands
and money to pay for the trip.
And all I ask is a cheery crowd, and steady,
smooth sailing,
And pretty girls on the top deck, and the
saxophones’ wailing.
I must go off to sea again, to the easy, lazy
life, ~
Sheltered from sun and wind and cold, from
thought, effort and strife.
And all I ask is a flutter at cards, kisses
and drinks and sport,
And a good hotel to be taxied to when the
ship comes into port.

POLITICAL POINTS
Page (Commerce) and Paterson (In-
terior) go into the Lyons Cabinet as a
result of the U.A.P.-C.P. treaty. Thorby
and Hunter become Hon. Ministers.
Thorby, a farmer, is to “assist the Min-
ister of Repatriation and administer war-
service homes.” Hunter, an accountant,
is to be Senator McLachlan’s offsider in
the House of Reps.—McLachlan is
P.M.G. and “Minister in charge of De-
velopment.” It seems likely that Hunter
would do better in Thorby’s job and
Thorby in Hunter’s.
Victorians now predominate in the
Administration. There are six Ministers
from Victoria (Menzies, White, Paterson,
Casey, Gullett and Brennan); five from
N. S. Wales (Page, Parkhill, Hughes,
Thorby and Marr), and one from each
of the other States. And N. S. Wales
representation will be reduced to four
when Marr retires—perhaps to Port
Moresby, or somewhere up that way.
Langsters protest that the Ma State has
been treated shamefully. They raised the
same cry in Scullin’s time, when the
Labor Prime Minister had four Vic-
torians with him and four representa-
tives of down-trodden Ma. “And Parker
Moloney,” they hissed, “is a Victorian at
heart, while Theodore is only a Johnny-
come-lately from Queensland.”
It was rough on E. J. Harrison to be
dropped from the Ministry before he had
had time to get over his promotion, but
he took it smiling, as befits an old oars-
man. Stewart was equally magnanimous.
Stewart is to help the Government with
its public-works plans. He is to be
called Director of Re-employment, or
something like that, and is to have “a sec-
retary but no department.” It sounds
well, but if the secretary doesn’t gather
a department about him the union will
declare him “black.”
“A slight earth tremor” is reported
from Canberra. It is perhaps attribut-
able to the effect on T. M. Shakespeare
of Auditor-General Cerutty’s refusal to
let that gentleman “drag” him to Can-
berra “by the scruff of the neck.” Mr.
Cerutty tartly explains that the work of
his central staff of nine “cannot be pro-
perly done with economy at Canberra,”
which is “too far from the centres of
activity.”
With another conversion loan to ar-
range, Bruce waited until Lyons and
Page had reached their agreement, which
suggests that he had a hand in it. Un-
fortunately there are no 6 per cents,
in the list this time, but the total of
£14,601,800, ail small-State operations,
includes £3,744,800 of Westralian 5 per
cents. They are all to be converted
to 3i per cent, at 99, and the interest
saving will be £lOO,OOO or so a year.
Governments in three States are getting
ready for general elections next year.
Stevens’s expects to have the first, and
is making preparations accordingly;
witness a U.A.P.-C.P. agreement that
“members of both parties will be sup-
ported as Government members, and no
member of either party who is a candidate
shall be opposed.’ As is customary
nowadays, the people’s consent is taken
for granted.
Labor, already in control of the
London County Council, had resound-
ing successes at the English muni-
cipal elections ; it gained almost every-
where in London and the Counties
at the expense of Progressives and Re-
formers. Fortunately for the Govern-
ment, a general election is not due until
1936, and, in any case, Sir Stafford
Cripps may save it. That scion of the
aristocracy who looks so namby-pamby
and talks with such ferocity has oppor-
tunely announced that he “could not
imagine Labor coming into power with-
out a first-rate financial crisis ; that is
why 1 demand full emergency measures.”
After 20 months of the New Deal the
Roosevelt party has won the biennial
elections for Congress by increased
majorities in both Houses. It has lavishly
distributed public money among all sec-
tions of the electorate, except the
minority that has to find most of the
taxes and support most of the loans, and,
as A 1 Smith puts it, “Nobody wants to
shoot Santa Claus.” Smith was defeated
for the Presidency by Australia’s old
friend, Hoover. Politicians with a gift
for seeing to the heart of things and for
expressing what they see in picturesque
speech are so rare that' it is rather a
pity he came four years too soon.
Westralian Labor has confessed that
it is relieved at the lack of opposi-
tion to its tax of Is. 4d. in the £
on net profits of goldmining companies.
Considering that one, Lake View and
Star, made profits amounting to £545,000
Australian last year and distributed 57|
per cent, in dividends, their philosophic
resignation can be understood. The im-
post will return very little more than the
cost of caring for Westralians dusted in
the mines.
Australia has happily been free of
anti-Semitic feeling. Now Nazi sym-
pathisers are at work and “dodgers” sug-
gesting boycotts of Australian Jews are
being circulated. The propagandist's are
wasting their time. Persecution is a
plant that does not thrive on Australian
soil.
The Federated Loco. Enginemen are to
get an industrial award at last. They
went in pursuit of one seven years ago,
and the case has been dragging on ever
since, with familiar accompaniments.
Millions of words were recorded in evi-
dence, and thousands of exhibits were put
in by both sides.
The award provides for a basic wage of
10s. Bd. a day in Vic. and 2d. more in
"Seven years we waited for our award,
mister. When do you reckon to
finish the appeal?”
South Aus. and Tasmania, with mar-
ginal increases for most skilled men and
small reductions here and there. Engine-
cleaners are to get another 4d. a day. It
will take a lot of fourpences to make
up what they have had to pay in levies
to meet the costs.
In the Leg. Assembly the other day
Lang hotly objected to being “kept here
dealing with grasshoppers and other little
tiddly-winking matters.” A queer out-
burst for a politician who has so
often claimed to be country-minded.
The grasshoppers have invaded four
States and wrought destruction in places
as far apart as Eyre’s Peninsula and the
Macintyre River. At the week-end they
were reported to be “thick in the River-
ina” and to be “advancing towards Mil-
dura on a 60-mile front.” Tiddly-
winking !
Lang has taken to attending “younger-
set” dances—the State A.L.P. has
“younger sets” now. No doubt he needs
some relaxation after the ghastly lick-
“Be careful with your feet, please! This
is a foxtrot, not a minority move-
ment.”
ings he has suffered, especially the latest
on the coalfields; but it’s a queer rever-
sal of form. Time was when he couldn’t
be dragged to a social function.
A new redistribution is a Forgan con-
clusion in Queensland. The last was
in 1932, when the Moore Government
reduced the membership from 72 to 62.
In 1929 11 Labor members were re-
turned to represent 46.000 electors,
whereas four non-Labor members repre-
sented 45,000 electors. Eight districts
had fewer than 4500 electors each ; four
others had over 11,000 each. Under the
Moore plan the smallest district has
5740 and the largest. 10,925 ; but it
doesn’t suit the other side.
Hoover, criticising his successor’s poli-
cies, declares that Government relief
workers are getting more than the pay
prescribed for corresponding jobs in the
much-advertised industrial codes. The
farm-relief programme has led to cases
like the following:
A New England farmer had been rais-
ing hogs for 40 years and never made
more than 400 dollars in any one year.
This year he has received a Government
cheque for 1000 dollars for not raising
hogs.
But “nobody wants to shoot Santa Claus”
-—till he brings bills instead of gifts.
Electoral Department returns show
that 3,708,578 ballot-papers were marked
at the Senate elections, and that 420,747
(11.35 per cent.) were informal. Queens-
land, with 28,601 informals out of
517,878, had far and away the best
record; Tasmania, with 20,183 out of
132,807, had the worst. But there were 14
candidates in Tasmania, and only three
“grouped” ; Victoria, with eight candi-
dates, six grouped, had 102,227 informals
out of 1,050,288. No doubt many people
have the vote who are not intelligent
enough to exercise it; but others spoil
their ballot-papers because they dislike
the candidates; others again because
they object to compulsory voting.
Butler has set Stevens and Argyle an
example by introducing a Companies Bill
which will strew rocks in the path of
bogus promoters and go-getters. Among
other things, it prohibits share-hawking
from house to house. And it prescribes
as much as five years’ gaol for
Any director, manager or other officer of
a company being wound up who destroys,
mutilates, alters or falsifies any books,
papers or securities or is privy to the
making of any false or fraudulent entry in
any register, book or account or document
with intent to defraud or deceive.
The measure embodies the recommen-
dations of a select committee. It con-
tains 401 clauses.
Defeated in the N.S.W. Leg. Assembly
on its plan for having Alsatian dogs in
sheep-raising districts sterilised, the Cocky
minority got the clause reinserted in the
Upper House, and put to the vote again
in the Assembly when some of the most
vociferous opponents were absent. Then
the Government Whip moved the closure
and sterilisation was agreed to. U.A.P.
members, headed by Peter Loughlin,
swore they had been tricked. Certainly,
it was a shabby way of doing a justifi-
able thing.
Hitler’s recipe for political success
Dare to begin everything that must be
done! Therein lies the greatness and the
characteristic of leadership. Anyone can
easily dare to continue afterwards He
who tries only to please is weak in the
eyes of man on whose pleasure he de-
pends.
It has been a success in Adolph’s case.
He had seven followers in 1919, and 23
attended his first meeting at Tegernsee in
Bavaria in 1921. Now, having seen
scores of typical politicians go the way
of all vote-buyers, he has several mil-
lion worshippers who look like sticking
to him.
A Sydney daily, reporting a discus-
sion as to the Parliamentary arrange-
ments for Cup Week, attributed to the
Prime Minister the remark:-
I admit quite frankly that I want to see
the Cup.
On this The Bulletin made some com-
ments which were not kind.. It learns
from. “Hansard” that they were unwar-
ranted, and it apologises. The Prime
Minister acknowledged having moved
the adjournment last year so that mem-
bers might go to the Cup ; this time the
adjournment was required for other
purposes, and, for himself, “I have never
attended a Cup.”
“G.M.”: What a tragic farce was the
appeal to the High Court regarding the
conviction of Tuckiar, the N.T. abo. who
murdered Constable McColl! From the
time Tuckiar was arrested, everybody
knew that nothing would be done to
him; yet the Commonwealth went
through the mummery of having him
tried and sentenced to death and then
standing by ineptly until the appeal was
dealt with. If Tuckiar had been par-
doned as soon as he was convicted, the
matter would have closed. As it was,
the people of Australia have probably
been stung for £5OOO or £6OOO in ex-
penses over the ridiculous observance of
legal red-tape.
“Prof.”: Now that the Commonwealth
Government is taking such care to see
that we shall read only the right sort of
books and listen only to the right sort of
lecturers, it might study the criminal
code of Japan, which provides for the
arrest and punishment of persons who
“harbor dangerous thoughts.” A great
revenue might be collected in fines from
offenders for the thoughts they harbor
about such things as the censorship and
the air-mail time-limit and Archdale
Parkhill’s bill of expenses. The list
might be extended indefinitely, and
the receipts would go a long way toward
redeeming the latest issue of Treasury
bills.

Alfred Minchin, Director (like his
father before him and his son after him)
of Adelaide Zoo, has left estate valued at
nearly £16,000.
Dubbo (N.S.W.) claims unique war
experiences for one of its band of Dig-
gers, F. Marsh. He enlisted on his 18th
birthday, was wounded on the 19th and
gassed on the 21st. Nowadays he is a
printer, a cheery soul and not a bit
superstitious when his birthday comes
round.
From Albury:—-
The “broadcaster” thanked by the Dutch
for his part in saving their airliner (B.
7/11/ ’34) is Newnham, A.B.C.’s announcer at
2CO. Newnham is a young Englishman who
enlisted for war service at the age of 15; there
are four little Australian-born Newnhams.
Newnham had to improvise connection between
the studio at Albury and the transmission
station at Corowa. While being towelled up
for taking the initiative in making a local broad-
cast, he heard the ’plane coming back. He
improvised an almost instantaneous relay from
the racecourse at Albury to 3AR Melbourne,
so that practically the whole Southern Hemi-
sphere was able to follow events through the
national network. Needless to say, the repri-
mand has since been converted into generous
and unstinted praise from the Commission.
The Governor of Victoria.
The poor lost a good friend in Arch-
bishop Spence, who has died in S.A. at
74. He was an Irishman with Lisbon
training who came to Australia as a
Dominican prior in 1898, and succeeded
Archbishop O’Reilly in 1915. The high-
est tributes to his worth came from those
who were not co-religionists. Anglican
Dean Jose spoke of his “ability, cour-
tesy, kindliness, high character; my
tribute is from personal experience
through many years.” And the Council
of Churches called him “a most cour-
teous Christian gentleman.”
“Cockayne”: In reference to the
baronetcy of Alderman Stapley, of Mel-
bourne (B. 31/10/’34), critics allege that
there are no traces of it in the usual
reference books. This is from the
“Complete Baronetage” (Vol. 111, page
97):
Stapley, or Stapeley, created 28 July,
1660, extinct 22 August, 1701. Assumed
since 1887.
When Alderman Stapley inherited on the
death of his brother, he is alleged to
have let the baronetcy lapse again. But
can baronetcies be assumed and dropped
in this casual manner? Perhaps Sir
Nevile Wilkinson, the only heraldry ex-
pert to visit Australia, will explain.
Charlie Neunhoffer, who has died in
Detroit, was a telegraph-boy in his native
Bendigo. Then he turned racing cyclist,
helped to found the League of Wheelmen
and was its handicapper for years. From
bicycles he turned to cars, and became
first a traveller for a motor firm and
later a partner. He got among the really
big money when he became associated
with G. L. Scott, owner of La Trobe,
in the Canada Cycle and Motor Co.
George O. Ross Fenner holds what is
probably the Melbourne Cup-witnessing
record. He was at Flemington when
Archer won the first' Cup in 1861, and
he has seen the Cup every year since,
with the exception of 1928, when an
attack of pneumonia prevented him
from applauding Statesman’s win. In-
cidentally, he is the only surviving mem-
ber of the original V.R.C., which was
born of the amalgamation of Victoria’s
Turf and Jockey Clubs in 1864. He
can recall the brave days when bullock-
drays conveyed crowds to Flemington
and when many of the best people
sported cabbage-tree hats in the paddock.
At 90 Mr. Fenner is the “father” of the
Athenaeum Club. He joined it in the
early ’sixties.
Here is Finey’s
conception of
Lord Hunting-
field, the Anglo-
Australian cav-
alryman who was
the Duke’s prin-
cipal host during
the centenary
celebrations. Vic-
toria’s latest Gov-
ernor is already
popular with all
classes. He is
said to be a sport :
it covers every-
thing.
Fred de Jersey,
who went to an
honored rest at
79 in Brisbane
last week, was a
Channel Islands
product who be-
gan to drive a
hansom as far
back as 1877.
“Old Fred,” as
he became, pick-
ed on a pitch in
front of Len-
non’s Hotel, ad-
jac e n t to the
Supreme Court.
His superlatively
appointed gon-
dola, which was
always horsed to match, was sought
by Judges and the shining lights of the
Bar, and this gave rise to an obsession
among juniors that to be seen riding in
Fred’s cab was about the best start in
life a young barrister could make. Fred
fought it out with the taxis literally to
the death, and latterly had been the last
of his tribe in Brisbane.
A good Australian family:
R. R. Dangar, breeder-owner of Peter Pan,
has a distinction which is all his own; race-
goers (and other members of the public) know
less about him than they do of any previous
owner of a Melbourne Cup winner. The
Dangars are like “Bobs”: they “don’t adver-
tise.” There are two branches of this important
pastoral family in N. S. Wales, and the capa-
city which most of them display for keeping
out of the social-gossip columns amounts to
genius. R.R.’s father was A.A., a pre-war vice-
president of the Union Club, and he has a
brother, N.N. C.C., another brother (all the
males of this branch of the family have allitera-
tive Christian names), was a retired British
cavalry officer who joined up with the A.I.F.
and died as a result of his war service. The
heads of the other Dangar branch, L.A. and
R.N., are sons of Henry, M.L.C., who built
a Norman castle on Potts Point and was presi-
dent of the Union Club at the beginning of
the century. The Dangars are not what the
Americans call mixers, but it’s an axiom in
Sydney that no one has heard one of them
skite, sneer or tell a lie.
In 1926 lan D. Coster, then a junior
reporter on the Christchurch “Press,”
left M.L. and broke into Australian jour-
nalism. After a spell as publicity man
for Pavlova, he edited the short-lived
Auckland “Sun.” And so to London.
Now he is assistant-editor of Nash’s
“Pall Mall Magazine” ; and he isn’t 30!
Two retired Australian bankers who
formerly were widely known have died
in S.A. Hayter Reed, 77, was manager
of the Australasian in several States, end-
ing in Adelaide. Frank Dunk, 64, will
be remembered as a 6ft. 6in. figure in
the National at Perth.

The late Harry Stephen—son 01 C. 8., the
Sydney K.C. of other days—was oddly unlike
most members of a family which runs true to
gP« « a rule. , tie turned to the law, as the
Stephens have been doing for a couple of
centuries, and practised lor a while at the
N. S. Wales Bar; but he wasn’t outstandingly
successful. The average Stephen is nothing if
not a personality. Harry Stephen was on the
“dim” side. A gentle, kindly and sweet-natured
character, he did everything he turned his hand
to adequately, but nothing conspicuously well.
Thirty-odd years ago he was expected to
develop into a cricketer of inter-State class,
but he didn’t. His golf was good, but never
very good. He loved fly-fishing, but was no
Herbert Palmer. Everybody liked him at the
Union and Rose Bay clubs, where his tall, lean
figure and amiable smile had been conspicuous
for over quarter of a century. He lived a club
life because—again unlike most of the Stephen
men h e never married.

Exdlg : Vol. Molesworth, dead in
Sydney at 44, was one of those dynamic
, • , , ,1 , . tt„
beings who burn themselves out. He
literally burst into the Clerks’ Union in
its early days ; then he burst into politic?
and into journalism. He could turn a
mild bit of news into a Horrible Sensa-
tion and really believe it was a sensa-
tion. As managing editor of the “Daily
Guardian,” he worked practically around
the clock; but he overdid it. Latterly,
whenever I met him he seemed apathetic
about politics, journalism and all else,
and preoccupied with his illnesses. His
parents participated in Lane’s New Aus-
tralia experiment, which was how he

stamps: he probably knew as much
about them as any man in Sydney.
Death has robbed George Harding,
great-grandfather of Dunwich Benevo-
lent Asylum, Stradbroke Island (Q.), of
his 101st birthday party, which he was
to have attended in December. His
favorite memories were of the funeral
of the Duke of Wellington in 1852 and
the departure of the troops for the Crimea.

in their trousers.”) Nor did his recol-
lections appear to be bogus as in the

When slump arrived this big t.-p. house
was carrying well over half a million
of book debts. It had just built itself
a fine new headquarters in Railway-
square, and went a bit into debt' for the
purpose ; also, the old premises have re-
mained on its hands, and the subsidiaries,
in which it has invested £312,900 in
shares, have been unable to contribute
to the pool, and it is difficult to say
when they are likely to become much
of a help. All this and complications
arising out of the contraction in employ-
ment, incomes and prices, and stoppage
of the privately-owned ’bus services
show up in losses aggregating £138,232
over the three years to the close of
accounts in ’33.
Now the co. has turned the corner,
thanks to the management’s tight hold
upon its problems (chiefly debtors’ bal-
ances and stocks) and the improvement
in conditions generally, which, in turn, is
due partly to the Government’s policy of
cut and spend. The spring in the year’s
gross earnings (£60,155) was £45,916.
Including the allowance for depreciation,
shown as written off in the table, exes.
(£48,374) were £3586 lighter, leaving a
net profit of £11,781, an improvement of
£49,502 over the previous year’s result.
The immediate outlook is for a better
showing at next balance ; sales continue
to increase, and the co.’s experience with
debtors’ balances has been better than
early anticipations.
The £1,035,386 of paid capital is in
300,000 first 6 p.c. and 297,848 second
p.c. cum. prefs (both subject to 22\
p.c. statutory cut) and 439,580 ords.
When the books closed there was over
£136,000 coming to the prefs. in accrued
divs. The firsts now call for £15,000 and
the seconds £17,180 p.a., together
£32,180 p.a. The market prices the
firsts at 17s. and the seconds at 13s. 3d.,
the book value of the cover being
£3 13s. 6d. and £2 13s. lid. respectively

fetch 7s. 9d.

less liquid surplus (£84,269) was £10,693.

What has happened here? For the
second time in the last four years —in-
deed, since the collapse of trade fol-
lowing the bank crashes of the early
’nineties —this old-established Bourke-
street retailer of high-class softgoods has
balanced on the wrong side. Much of
the trouble in 1931, when a loss of
£24,622 was recorded, arose out of im-
ported merchandise. After that appear-
ances were that the management had
overcome the stocks and other problems.
Half-way through the last term things
looked good enough to hand the ords. 2}
p.c. Yet the co. finished the year with a
trading loss of £17,894. Dislocation
caused during the first half by further
rebuilding operations, etc., necessary be-
cause the lease of adjoining premises
ran out, no doubt affected earnings ; but
the root of the trouble was a drastic
writing down of stocks. A year earlier
these were reported to be of the newest,
and conservatively valued, which sug-
gests some unlucky buying during the last
term —high-priced fashion goods, especi-
ally those from overseas, are exceedingly
difficult lines these days. The loss, the
pref. div. and The interim payment to
the ords. ate into reserves for £36,495,
reducing the tangible support for capital
to £36,781 —goodwill (£60,741) is not
treated as an asset herein.
During the year £41,183 was added to
the premises item dnd £30,519 to plant;
the net reduction in the book value of
stocks was £358:

(£27,444), an extra £43,327 of deposits
(£163,565) was gathered, the cash hold-
ing at the previous balance (£11,606)
was used and the board went to its
bankers for £20,758. Excluding the staff
pension fund (£16,686), outside liabilities
exceeded more or less liquids by £52,263
when the books closed, a swing of
£119,829 over the twelvemonth.
The market, which notes that the ords.

fAfter paying 7 p.c. on prefs. and ords.
Of all the Australian life offices which
set up since the war, this is the only
one to have yet definitely turned the
corner. With E. J. Mooney at the helm,
it kicked off in Sydney with £14,610 of
share capital in 1921 —there are 15,135
7 p.c. prefs. and 19,895 ords., all of 10s.
each, paid to Bs. At June 30 last, its
assets totalled £564,479, free of intan-
gibles, and the business, mostly Industrial
assurance, had spread to Vic., S. Aus.
and Westralia. The actuary’s second
quinquennial overhaul (at the close of
accounts in 1931) showed that £23,474
was available for distribution among
policy-holders and shareholders. Bonuses
to policy-holders ranging from 21s. p.c.
in the Industrial to 30s. p.c. in the Ordi-
nary department were declared, the
prefs.’ slate was cleaned, the ords. got
5 p.c. and £9158 was set aside as a bonus
reserve.
Steady progress has been made since.
The basis of valuation has been reduced
from 4 p.c. to 3 \ p.c., and shareholders,
who were originally entitled to 80 p.c.
of the profits, reduced their moiety 10
p.c., leaving 90 p.c. to be divided among
policy-holders, whose interests have been
thus .placed .in the. foreground. Bonuses
to policy-holders have been increased in
the Ordinary department to £2 ss. p.c.
on whole-of-life and 30s. p.c. on endow-
ment assurances, and in the Industrial
section to 255. p.c. for whole-of-life,
while the ord. div. has been lifted to
7 p.c., with prospects.
The spring in last year’s income was
£20,979, of which £15,472 was in respect
of premiums (£157,758, including £2589
of fire and general business), and £5507
interest and rents, etc. (£27,063). After
paying all legitimate claims and exes,
and an interim div. of £9BB, £90,081, or
£15,869 more than for the previous year,
was added to funds, raising them to
£540,547, of which £528,886 was in re-
spect of life assurance. Excluding in-
come tax (£1396, down £3368), exes, took
37.9 p.c. of the net premiums, approxi-
mately the same as in the previous term.
It is in the return from interest and
rents where the co. has scored, and con-
tinued to do so. After deducting taxa-
tion, the actual net return on mean
total funds fell from 5.7 p.c. in 1931 to
3.9 p.c. in 1933, and rose to a shade over
5 p.c. for the last term, thanks partly to
the Government’s action in putting taxa-
tion of life offices on a less inequitable
basis.
The protection for policy-holders and
shareholders is in this form:

flats. Since the close of accounts the co.

There was a steady improvement in the
restaurant business, and structural altera-
tions to two of the shops helped to fur-
ther liven turnover there. But three
others were closed, owing to the high
rental demanded by lessors. Still, it
was a stroke of good business, being
mainly responsible for the reduction of
£12,653 in exes. (£155,829). Gross earn-
ings (£165,148) were £6839 lighter, of
which £3OOO was on account of the Fed-
eral flour tax, which operated for six
months of the term. The net result was
thus £5814 better at 3.1 p.c. on capital.
That leaves out of the reckoning £13,396
struck off advances on mortgage (now
£33,975) and charged to reserves, making
the net reduction therein £56,986 over
the last five years.
After a three years’ drought share-
holders, who had received a steady 15
p.c. for the five years to the close of
accounts in 1929, got back into the pic-
ture with 2} p.c. This disappointed the
market (a profit of £6025 was announced
for the first half of the term), and the
pound shares, which rose from 10s. 6d.
to 16s. lid. over the eight months to
May last, dropped back to 15s. At
15s. the return is 3.3 p.c. on a 2\ p.c.
div. basis, or 5.3 p.c. on a 4 p.c. distri-
bution, which would call for £11,666.
The cover is 21s. sd. in net tangibles.
Part of the co.’s troubles has been
due to a vigorous policy of property
purchase during the boom. While such
a policy may yield glittering results on a
rising market, it usually spells trouble on
a falling one, especially where deals have
been financed largely on borrowed funds.
However, there has been a marked im-
provement in the co.’s position in this
respect over the last five years:

Last year the co.’s own advances on
mortgage were reduced by £38,396, of
which £13,396 was on account of the
writing-off already referred to. The other
£25,000, together with current earn-
ings and the amount which, became
available from minor reductions in other
assets, enabled £28,551 to be clipped off
the overdraft (£7055) and £10,058 off
the amount coming to sundry creditors
(£45,925); there was little change in the
mortgage (£150,540). Again owing to
the writing-off, the excess of liabilities
over more or less liquids, excluding
shares in other cos., increased by £2535,
reaching £155,882. The shareholdings
consist chiefly of 23,000 8 p.c. prefs.
and 37,000 ords in Lucullus, Ltd. (it has
ceased to contribute to the pool), which
took over the co.’s Melbourne business,
together with a mortgage for £lOO,OOO,
about four years ago, 12,000 shares in
City Property Estates, Sydney, and the
scrip in Sargents (Wholesale), Ltd.
Immediate prospects are that the co.
will make a better showing at next
balance.

Few concerns have done better for
their shareholders than this manufac-
turer of cardboard boxes, cartons and
corrugated-fibre containers. It enjoys a
unique position in the trade, thanks to
the imagination and enterprise of James
Fielding, its managing director, the hus-
banding of finances and technical and
other efficiency. Only once in the last
seven years have shareholders had less
than 15 p.c.; that was in ’3l, when 10
p.c. was paid. Moreover, 15 p.c. is
worth a lot more to old holders, nearly
two-thirds of the capital having been pro-
vided out of surplus earnings; also, the
one-for-five new issue at par in ’33 was
in the nature of a bonus to shareholders,
the scrip being at a high premium in
the market. The £30,500 of fresh capi-
tal then gathered was used to finance
further expansion of the Melbourne
business.
During the last term turnover in the
co.’s own products continued to improve,
and so did returns from investments,
which include the Melbourne subsidiary
and a wad of other well-selected securi-
ties. A year ago these investments pro-
vided “a handsome contribution to manu-
facturing profits.” The board put the
year’s net return from all sources at
£35,553 (up £3OOO-odd). Including
£10,600 dropped from somewhere into
reserves, there was enough to show 25.6
p.c. on capital as against 18.6, 26.5, 10.8,
15.4, 27.4 and 27 p.c. back to 1928. The
div. was kept at 10 p.c. and the usual
5 p.c. bonus was added.
Three years ago the pound shares
could be picked up on the market at
295.; they now fetch 725. 6d. or there-
abouts. The return at 725. 6d. is 4.1 p.c.
on the basis of a 15 p.c. distribution.
Visibly, the net tangible cover is 365. 4d.
Here is the position, so far as balance-
sheet figures show it:

This Victorian co. has been manufac-
turing powdered milk, etc., for the last
25 years. Of its £150,000 of paid capital,
£90,000 is bonus scrip, handed out about
11 years ago from the proceeds of har-
vests gathered during the war period.
For the seven years to the close of
accounts in 1930, divs. averaged a shade
over 12 p.c. Then slump brought with

sions, while exchange and the rise in the
price of tin kept the bill for tinplate

A SLIRE F RIEND IN UNCE RTAINTIMI'S -
1934 DECEMBER _ 1934
DON'T DELAY
—the weeks slip by.
Be sure you get your share of this year's
A.M.P. Bonus.
THOSE who, before the end of the year, effect participating
policies with the Society in its ordinary department, receive the
bonus for 1934. That is an additional reason why men should
get into early touch with the Society (by mail or through one of its
many offices and counsellors), with a view to increasing their
assurance. It is not the main reason. The main reason is the merit
and comfort of membership in the Society, for an A.M.P. policy is
the safest investment a man can make; it is a protection and a
blessing as well as an investment; it is an investment that enables
a man to sleep well o’ nights.
A.M.P. policies have a remarkable way of growing, with bonuses,
as these typical, actual examples show:—
Bonus additions as at 31st December, 1933.
Hadn’t you better effect another (or your first) policy before the
year closes?
Ask that an experienced counsellor be sent to talk over your needs
with you, or, if you live far from an A.M.P. office, that a copy of
“Investing in Happiness,” be posted to you. Don’t delay; the weeks
slip by.

ASSETS - £9.3,000,000 ' * V
INVESTED IN THE COMMONWEALTH AND NEW ZEALAND
(£23,488) were £4164 better. The net
result benefited by the whole of the
increase and £l6B besides, reaching 8.4
p.c. on capital as against 5.5, 4.6, 5.1,
11.2, 13.7 and 17.8 p.c. back to 1928.
The div. was lifted from 4\ p.c. to 6 p.c.,
of . which 1 p.c. was labelled bonus.
Over the last two years the pound
shares have advanced from 15s. 6d. to
245. 6d. in the market. At the higher
figure the return is 4.9 p.c. on a 6 p.c.
div. basis, with prospects. These depend
largely upon the success or otherwise of
the new subsidiary, Kestner Evaporated
Food Products, which has just begun
spray-drying fruit, vegetable and other
food products, and upon the develop-
,ment of trade with Eastern Asia, where
the outlook is said to be encouraging.
The co: has enough ready money to
finance considerable expansion of its
activities:

The formation of the subsidiary already
referred to is reflected in the appear-
ance of shares in other cos. at £11,500.
Excluding this item, the more or less
liquid surplus (£99,813) was only £1095
lighter than at the previous balance.
Goldmines of Papua, a prospecting off-
shoot of Alluvial Tin, has met with
encouraging results in a preliminary over-
haul of its Misima and Woodlark Island
properties. At Misima the existence of
two well-defined lodes has been proved
over a length of 1700 ft. by adits, driven
at regular horizons from the creek bed,
to a vertical height of 500 ft. on the Mt.
Sisa Ridge. These bodies are now being
thoroughly tested by drives and cross-
cuts, which are also expected to tap at
least two other lines of lode on the s.-e.
slope of the ridge. The work, designed
to block approximately 600,000 tons of
ore, is scheduled to take about nine
months. As elsewhere on the island, gold
distribution is erratic, values thus far
ranging from 2.ldwt. to 15.92dwt.
After checking A. J. Peterson’s work, Leo
Gibbons says the leases have every
possibility of becoming a big producer.
Much will depend upon developments
in the lower tunnels. Preliminary work
on the Kulumadau lease, Woodlark
Island, at present confined to the north-
ern section of the old workings, is en-
couraging, too. Here also there is 100,000
tons of I.o2dwt. sands and slimes, worth
£30,600 with gold at £6 an ounce, Aus-
tralian currency. Working exes, are put
at not more than £13,000, leaving £17,600,
or a bit more if better extraction proves
to be possible.
* * * *
For the 12 months to June 26 last
Mt. Morgan netted £80,569 as against
£30,454, for the previous year. Two divs.
of 6d. each together took £34,418. The
co. treated 153,280 tons of ore for 5797
tons of concentrates, assaying soz. gold
and 8.7 p.c. copper, the metal content
being 30,392.170 z. gold and 504.79 tons
copper. The concentrating ratio was
26.4 to 1, and recoveries, affected by
highly oxidised ore during the last quar-
ter of the term, were 66.81 p.c. gold
and 83.02 p.c. copper. Costs were
lowered by Is. 2.25 d. per ton for mining
(7s. 2.01 d., including overburden) and
3s. 11.63 d. for milling (Bs. 10.57 d.).
Since the close of accounts introduction
of the Edquist process has improved
gold recoveries and further lowered mill-
ing costs, and savings are expected in
other directions, too. Including 2,000,000
tons of readily accessible stone, ore re-
serves are figured at 7,748,000 tons, aver-
aging 4.2Bdwt. gold and 1.76 p.c. copper.
Finances are comfortable. To meet
£8029 coming to creditors, etc., there
was over £51,000 in cash alone. Paid
capital is £196,841 in 800,000 shares of
ss. each, which the market prices at
355. To deal with new properties offer-
ing, a prospecting subsidiary in which
shareholders have been offered 400,000
2s. shares at par, one for two, has been
formed. It is now running the rule over
some promising ground adjoining the
Swan Bitter Co.’s leases (W.A.).
* * * *
One of the richest tin crushings for
many years in N.Q. came out of the Can-
berra mine, Herberton, last month. A
parcel of 74 tons yielded 17£ tons of
concentrates, worth £3176, an average
of £43 per ton of ore. Gilbert Petter
bought the show in 1932, and has since
had regular crushings of high value. No
Herberton man more deserves his money
back. In the past he backed many of
the miners’ shows, with only an occa-
sional winner. Tin-mining activity is
increasing in the district, one of the
cheeriest items being an approaching
crushing from the Wild Irishman; the
Cornishman, big but low-grade, is pro-
ducing well —155 tons of ore yielded 23
tons of concentrates. The Great North-
ern, now on the east lode, has nothing
yet that can be transmuted into dividend,
and the Christmas outlook is cold.
* * * *
Biggenden Bismuth Mine (C.Q.),
opened by a Sydney co. interested in
chemicals, has just started production.
Recovery is to be by froth flotation,
which should be ideally suited to drop
the magnetic iron oxide, which has been
somewhat of a nuisance in the past. Gold
for the mint and bismuth for the chemi-
cal factory in N.S.W. are the objectives.
The deposit is big, and promises to pay
on the new plan. Flotation capacity is
50 tons daily, and the best of the mine
dumps are being treated first.
* * * ♦
Interest in N.Q. will focus on the im
minent reopening of the Tyrconnel!
mine, which used to be the biggest pro-
ducer on the Hodgkinson goldfield. The
workings are deep and the ore average
medium, but the lode is a big one. Oliver
Reece is returning to Australia to be
g.m. of a co. which proposes to reopen
a chain of old mines on the Hodgkin
son, which is just outside Mareeba. He
has been in U.S.A. and Britain expound-
ing the prospects of the field to the wily
capitalist.
* * * *
North Arm field, near Gympie (Q.),
plods steadily on with crushings less
hectic than in the discovery days. Last
month’s clean-up (battery and cyanide)
of 375 tons of ore was worth roughly £3
per ton. W. H. Runge is conservative,
however, and the feeling is that there
is something better in the Golden
Surprise locker. There has been much
driving on the Coolum reef lately,
apparently with very in-and-out results.
* H= * *
During the last 12 months Wiluna
(W.A.) has quickened the extraction of
crudes from 33,000 to 44,000 tons a
month, and lowered it's treatment costs
to 18s. 6d. (Australian currency) per ton ;
that includes 2s. 6d. for development.
The appearance of the mine has im-
proved at depth, a new ore-body has
been located between the West and No.
2 West lodes, and a new shaft is being
sunk to develop a wide make of stone in
the Bulletin lease, and to explore other
possibilities in this area. Positive ore
reserves at August 31 were figured at
1,786,000 tons (up 253,900 tons), averag-
ing 28s. 6d. In addition there is a large
tonnage not yet developed.
* * * *
The Yellowdine gold find looks like
the best auriferous outcrop that has been
discovered in Westralia for a long time.
It is in a small belt of greenstone bush
country, near Southern Cross, and nearer
still to Yellowdine siding on the Eastern
goldfields railway line. How the deposit
escaped notice for so many years is diffi-
cult to understand. Values on the surface
and in costeens average upwards of an
ounce per ton, for several hundred feet
in length, and geologists have formed a
favorable opinion regarding the perma-
nency of the formation. Claude de Ber-
nales has secured options over the best
blocks, and has announced that Com-
monwealth Mining and Finance, Ltd.,
will take an important part in their
development.
* * * *
Sons of Gwalia (W.A.) is slowing
down ore treatment by 50 tons a day,
pending installation of grinding and
classification equipment. These addi-
tions are expected to be complete some
time in January. The mine continues
sound at depth, and appears to be cap-
able of producing enough gold to main-
tain present divs. for a long time.

R. J. Hylton, chief metallurgist and
plant super, for Lake View and Star,
has been appointed assistant-manager to
Great Boulder Prop. He is a flotation
expert with wide experience, and will
take charge of Boulder’s new plant, which
has caused the co.’s officials many sleep-
less nights during the past few months.

doned its option over the old Imperial,

QUESTIONS ANSWERED.
(Transferred from Service Department .)
Best method of testing samples of gold made
up into a mercury pill ? —3675.
Select a large, well-rounded potato, free
from cracks, and cut it in halves. In one half
scoop out a hole large enough to hold the
amalgam. Place the amalgam in the hole,
join the halves and wire them tightly together.
Place the potato in hot ashes until it is baked.
Allow it to cool, then unwire it. A gold button
will be found in the potato, and the distilled
mercury may be recovered by squeezing the
potato to pulp. The gold obtained is then
weighed in the usual manner.
BRIEF ANSWERS.
D.C.R.: (1) A doubtful proposition, but not
without hope; sit tight for the present. (2)
Difficult to say what the future holds for
this show. _ Everything depends upon the
guarantee, which looks all right at the moment.
... .E.E.W. and K.E.McC.: These bonds are
a long-term speculation, and guesses as to
what profits are likely to be realised aren’t
worth much X.Y.Z.: (1) Cannot say. (2)
H01d... .C.H.W.: It was a case of plant ahead
of development. The area appears to be
patchy, and the future of the show doubtful.
M.S.: The co. is quite sound, and is doing
more than it originally undertook to do for
its bondholders. What they are likely to get
out °f the venture nobody can say definitely

“The House of Rothschild”
The difference between an Arliss
period film and most others is the dif-
ference between a representational and
the other kind of painting. The his-
torical dramas in which this great old
artist figures may be weak on facts, but
they are extraordinarily strong in atmo-
sphere. It is almost impossible to catch
Arliss out in a social anachronism.
“The House of Rothschild,” which
The Bulletin’s Melbourne critic has
already reviewed, was pre-shown at
United Artists’ Sydney theatrette last
week. It presents the founder of the
English branch of the family as
the possessor of the same kind of voice
as Wellington, and the Regent is shown
conferring the barony which didn’t
reach the family till 1885. Yet, as a
whole, the film creates an extraordinarily
vivid impression of Europe and England
during the Napoleonic era. Costumes,
furnishings, carriages and manners seem
absolutely right; the dialogue, in addition
to being amusing, is in character, and
Will Rogers in “Judge Priest,” at Sydney
Capitol.
Arliss gives a masterly portrait of old
Mayor Amschel in the Judengasse
sequences. He is the Arliss we all know
as the first of the English Rothschilds.
The story concerns the rise of Mayer’s
sons from the status of Ghetto outcasts
to that of virtual masters of Europe.
Ledrantz, the Prussian financier (looking
as sinister as Boris Kqrloff can make
him), is the chief villain, but Arthur
Byron, as the first head of Baring
Brothers (who, incidentally, was a child
at the time), runs him close. Metter-
nich (Alan Mowbray) and Talleyrand
(Georges Renavent) also come into con-
flict with the suave German Jew and are
dramatically worsted. C. Aubrey Smith
(Wellington) and Florence Arliss and
Helen Westley, as Nathan’s wife and
mother respectively, are admirable.
Robert Young,, as the soldier-lover of
Nathan’s daughter Julie (Loretta Young),
is awful. American accent apart, the
young man doesn’t even look like a sol-
dier. But it’s a great film on the whole;
the best that Arliss has appeared in, and
perhaps the best of its kind that has been
done.
“Little Man, What Now?”
Australians are so used to seeing Clark
Gable, William Powell, Ralph Lynn and
the rest portray themselves over and over
again that this film at Sydney Liberty
comes as an innovation. Douglass Mont-
gomery makes Hans a movie husband
who is entirely new to this part of the
world. A born job-loser, the young man
reacts to his misfortunes in a manner
that will seem absurdly emotional to the
casual Australian. But then the unem-
ployed German of to-day isn’t subsi-
dised generously by the State, and his
expectant wife doesn’t draw lavish
maternity benefits. Dread of the sack
breeds such neurotics as Hans by the
million in a modern nation that has lost
a war.
We watch him drift lugubriously from
one misfortune to the next. It is im-
possible not to sympathise—he has the
pathos of the congenital ineffective —but
it is also impossible not to feel impatient.
He behaves like a moral coward and a
weakling in every crisis. Lammchen
is the kind of wife such men often
acquire; as merry as he is glum
and humorless, zestful for the pleasures
of life and a little flirtatious, but staunch
and faithful at heart. She is a pleasing
change, too, from the exotics of Holly-
wood. Not particularly beautiful, and by
no means well-dressed, but a recognis-
able woman. The rest of the cast is
worthy of them. Alan Hale as a gross
Teuton gigolo—a criminal and a drunk,
yet likeable —provides about the brainiest
of the character studies. The others are
on the conventional side.
“Embarrassing Moments”
Chester Morris is a hereditary prac-
tical joker. A climax is reached when
one of his elaborate jest's threatens to ruin
the career of his best friend—who is also
his rival for the hand of Marion Nixon.
The friend pretends to shoot himself;
others pretend to believe that Chester is
a murderer, and the deflated joker flies
for his life.
The film now becomes a comic gang-
ster with a running fight between the
hero’s new friends and the police and
other familiar ingredients. Needless to
say, it doesn’t offer itself as a picture
of life, but as broad farce it is as good,
in spots, as the average Harold Lloyd
or Chaplin film. Present critic was par-
ticularly diverted by the S. American
duel sequence.
“Little Friend”
Seen at a Fox theatrette preview.
The central figures are the 11-year-old
daughter of wealthy parents and her
friend, the not-much-older son of a
Cockney shop-keeper. Wealthy parents,
Matheson Lang and Lucy Sherwood,
somewhat in the background (their story
is conveyed as far as possible from the
child’s standpoint), are estranged. The
wife has been philandering with an
actor, and the child has his portrait
in her bedroom, inscribed “To my
little friend.” During the divorce the
child has to give evidence against her
mother. In the face of the terrible Judge
and formidable K.Cs. she maintains stub-
born silence when asked the crucial ques-
tions —all to no avail. As her governess
tells her afterwards, everybody in court
Douglass Montgomery in “Little Man,
What Now?” at Sydney Liberty.
knew her silence meant assent. She will
be taken away from her mother, and
allowed to see her perhaps once a year.
So the youngster on arrival home writes
letters of farewell to her few friends —
mummy, daddy and Leonard, the Cock-
ney shop-boy—and turns on the gas-
heater in her bedroom without lighting it.
Nova Philbeam as the little girl and
Jimmy Hanley as the Cockney lad could
hardly be improved upon, and intelligent
use is made of German and Russian film
technique. The last ounce of emotional
effect is squeezed out of the dramatic
material, yet there isn’t a trace of mushi-
ness. A credit to England.
“Little Friend” will be shown at King’s
Cross Theatre, Sydney, on Friday night
in aid of the “Sun” Toy Fund.
“Come On, Marines!”
More U.S.A. naval propaganda.
Richard Arlen is the same old manly
hero, and Roscoe Karns is funny as the
Chester Morris and Henry Armetta in
“Embarrassing Moments,” at Syd-
ney Liberty.
marine who acts as foil and faithful
squire to the hero. Ida Lupino does her
best as the colorless heroine. At Mel-
bourne State.
“Lily of Killarney”
Dion Boucicault’s “Colleen Bawn”
has been brought up to date with
telephones and other modern appli-
ances in this film at Melbourne Athen-
aeum. Frankly an appeal to Irish
sentiment, the scenarists have re-
modelledj the old play and interpolated
a number of musical items to give it
atmosphere. Gina Malo, who is said to
be Irish in spite df her name, carries the
whole burden of the presentation as
Eileen O’Connor. She is pretty, win-
some and acts with charm, and John
Garrick is the hero, Stanley Holloway is
a singing priest of the old type and
Dennis Hoey plays Myles na Coppaleen.
Among the minor characters, the honors
go to Australia’s old friend Sara All-
good (Mrs. O’Connor). Miss Allgood is,
of course, the real thing, an Irish
“Player.” The trouble with the cast as a
whole is that its brogue is not uniform,
and at times is a very unconvincing
brogue. Again, the Ireland supposed to
be presented is the Ireland of to-day,
while the whole atmosphere is that of a
century back.
“Warn London”
One of the best mystery pictures of
which England has yet been guilty.
It turns on the old device of the resem-
blance between two men. One is a tool
of a gang of crooks; the other is the
detective allotted to bring them to jus-
tice. The juggling of the pair is so
cleverly worked that both the crooks and
the detectives are at their wits’ end to
know which man they are taking into
their confidence, and the audience itself
has its leg pulled at times. Another
original touch is that' the crooks have
been rounded up for a big kill by no
less a person than a German Professor
of Criminology who is in the confidence
of Scotland Yard.
Edmund Gwenn, always a winner,
plays the professor. John Loder doubles
the hero-crook part, and is excellent;
Lenora Corbett provides the love inter-
est.
“Judge Priest”
Irvin S. Cobb’s Judge is an under-
standable and likeable character —a Ken-
tucky lawyer who discovers the secret
of perpetual re-election. “The first prac-
tical thing I learnt about politics was
always to say ‘ain’t.’ ” Will Rogers’s per-
sistent eschewal of dignity, even in the
privacy of his home, appears a bit
labored, and the liberties that have been
taken with the episode that was chosen
as a plot for the stage version don’t im-
prove it. Rogers hasn’t Judge Priest’s
soft Southern accent, and he makes un-
couth what was intended to be eccentric.
In short, the film is another Rogers
stereotype. At Sydney Capitol.
“Midnight Alibi”
A gangster fantasia in which Richard
Barthelmess is a big shot and Ann
Dvorak the goil. She is the sister of
Angie the Ox (Robert Barrett), head of
a rival racket, who disapproves of Rich-
ard. Angie is bumped off by one of
Richard’s heelers, Richard is charged
with murder, and a romantic-minded old
millionairess gets him off by swearing
that he was visiting her when the clock
in her drawing-room stood at 12 —the
time of the crime as sworn to by a dozen
witnesses for the prosecution. Her clock
had stood at that hour for 40 years, but
millionairesses seem to be exempt from
cross-examination in the jurisdiction of
New York. Also at the Capitol.
“The Crime of Helen Stanley”
At the Plaza. A female film star
is shot during the production of a film.
Any one of about a dozen people had a
motive for getting rid of the lady.
Among those involved are the script girl,
the leading man, one of the executives,
two cameramen, a director arid the star’s
armed escort. The job of remem-
bering the lot of them and of following
their tangled movements becomes weari-
some before the film is half finished.
Ralph Bellamy plays the highly efficient
’tec. The shots of the film studio are the
most interesting features.
“The Desert Song”
A revival of one of the most popular
musical plays of the early talkie days.
John Boles (Red Shadow), Myrna Loy
(Riff dancing girl), Carlotta King (Mar-
got) and John Miljan (villain) are ex-
cellently cast, and the magnitude of the
chorus is impressive.
Richard Tauber in “Blossom Time,” at
Sydney Embassy.
“Double Door”
In this thriller at the Civic, Mary
Morris —who played the part on the
New York stage—is Victoria Van Brett,
the elderly head of a Fifth-avenue
family. Her one concern is the family’s
prestige as she understands it. The
formidable dame has terrorised her
younger sister and still younger brother,
imposing her will upon them with sadistic
zest. The brother marries a nurse, and
horror succeeds horror, the idea of an
ex-nurse becoming a Van Brett being
intolerable to Victoria; but, of course,
love triumphs in the end.
An exceptionally good cast includes
Colin Tapley, a Maorilander who re-
cently won a film-star contest.
Some First Nights
The band of the Grenadier Guards
saluted Sydney for the first time last
week. On the day of its arrival the
band was heard in the open air, when it
did its devoirs at the Cenotaph, and at
night in the Town Hall. Since then it
has given two indoor concerts every day
save Sunday, and is to go on doing so
till Saturday. It is a highly-etficient or-

ABORIGINALITIES
“Cleveland Bay”: That story of the
pig-crocodiles (B. 10/10/’34) recalls one
told me by a man whom, if he hadn’t
been sheriff of N.Q. at the time, I
wouldn’t have believed. In his earlier
days he had some Government job at
Cairns, and ran a little farm a mile or
two out of the town on the banks of a
considerable creek. His chief stock con-
sisted of ducks ; these he housed in a
big enclosure on top of the creek bank.
One night a terrible commotion in the
duck-pen brought him out in his
pyjamas, rifle in hand. As he reached
the yard he tripped over something large
and smelly, and found himself being car-
ried rapidly on the back of something
down the steep creek bank. A rousing
souse as his steed plunged into the water
with him still on its back followed. Day-
light explained all. Tracks showed that
an outsize croc, was trying to break into
the duckyard when my friend fell on its
back in the darkness and was carried
into the creek. There may be something
in the story, for I have seen the name of
the creek on the map. Our method of
countering the yam was to ask the old
gentleman if the crocodile had eaten him
or vice versa.

“Mulgo”: One place where special
efforts have failed to establish the rabbit
is South Solitary Island, whose light-
house is the loneliest and most difficult
to reach of the 19 beacons off the N. S.
Wales coast. In bad weather supplies
can’t be landed, and sometimes there is
a temporary famine: the ’keepers then
have to fish for snapper and black cod.
The rabbits were wanted as a reserve
food supply for such times, but South
Solitary is mostly bare rock, swept by
fierce winds and lashed by heavy seas.
The families can’t have a garden or a
goat. When attempts were made to
keep fowls, the chooks were blown into
the sea. Lots of things, including the
washing, get blown into the sea off bleak
Solitary. ,

“Crosscut”: I can assure “Diba More”
(B. 24/10/’34) that his boss boy is
right. Snakes have four legs. They don’t
drop off, but fit into sockets in their
sides. The next wriggler you kill, put him
or her on a slow fire of coals. When the
corpse stiffens the legs will push out.
* ❖ *
“Notaden”: Curious how many Aus-
tralians maintain that marsupials are
practically all herbivorous. Tasmanians
don’t,- recollecting the “devil” and the
native “wolf” ; but tell the next dinkum
Aussie that more species of marsupials
eat flesh or eggs or insects than eat grass
or leaves, and see what answer you get.
The numerous species of pouched rats
and pouched mice are fierce little carni-
vores, and cannibals too, always ready
to kill anything they can master. The
several kinds of native cats are blood-
thirsty killers. Bandicoots eat insects,
and will take meat whenever they can
get it; the echidna lives on ants ; the
platypus devours all manner of water
creatures and all the earthworms it can
get. Jerboas, the rare marsupial mole,
and the banded ant-eater all eat ants.
*** * .
“Colon”: Noticed a chicken-hawk
performing acrobatics round a dead
lamb; riding up, I found him neatly
tethered by the tongue to a string of
intestine. How he managed to tangle
himself with two half-hitches is a mys-
tery, but it postponed his demise until
a photograph was taken to put Doubt-
ing Thomases out of countenance.
* * * *
“Omtiddlyompom”: Tramping to
Westralia, I followed the old telegraph
road across the Nullarbor Plain, called
at Madura cattle station for water,
propped at the homestead inner gate,
and—l’ve never heard such a din since I
gave up fox-hunting in the Old Country.
“Come in,” shouted the boss ; “they’re
all locked up. Can’t keep house-dogs
here ; dingoes entice them away. But these
are just as useful.” He lifted the lid of a
kerosene-case, and half a dozen barking
lizards became dumb at the command
of “Lie down!” I asked how they were
fed. “Let ’em out of a night and whistle
’em home in the morning,” said my host.
Noticed one had a muzzle on.

“Waranbini”: North Queensland
blacks never eat raw oysters, though they
relish raw tree-grubs and cobra-, the long
milky-white worms found in mangroves
and submerged logs. When a gin sees
a white man enjoying the uncooked bi-
valve, she can be expected to raise her
“For yourself or your honorable son, master?”
hands in horror and cry, “Wah! Wah!”
A common variety about' the Peninsula
is a black-bearded oyster, which the
blacks say causes serious internal
troubles if eaten raw, besides making
the head swell and ache. They roast the
oysters on the coals in the same way as
freshwater mussels are cooked. Huge
beds of old shells are found here and
there on the coast, and there are always
ash-heaps near by—sometimes the re-
mains of 20 old fires around one pile
of shells. Bushels of the oysters are car-
ried inland by parties of blacks after a
camp near the sea, and are cooked at
old camping grounds.

“Groper”: Don’t tame cats gone wild
(B. 10 /9/ ’34) grow to outsizes! In Perth
Museum is a stuffed specimen of Felis
domesticus three times the size of the
biggest fireside tom. Captured in the
Murray (Pinjarra) district of W.A., it
was big enough to carry off a full-grown
fowl or duck.

“Varanus”: One point which the Coun-
cil has no more than touched lightly is
the method employed by an old-man
goanna when getting, down from a tree.
He can run up with ease and alacrity—
any old person can prove that at any old
time. Once up he shows a decided disin-
clination to come down again. His
species must come down—that’s obvious.
I won’t have it they come down head
first. The make and shape of their claws,
their whole build, everything—including
balance^—is against that means of descent.
To come down steadily tail first' seems
the feasible way. But I’ve never seen a go.
coming down in that manner ; and, any-
way, the go. seems to specialise in doing
things which are unorthodox. I’ll state
briefly how they come to earth, and I’ll
leave the Council to argue about it. They
jump from the bough of the tree in
which they happen to be sheltering.
* * * *
“Pine River”: The color of curlews’
eggs (B. 31/10/’34) recalls those of the
little brownish masked finch of N.Q.
scrubs. As soon as the nest is built, and
before egg-laying commences, this fowl
collects pieces of charcoal about the size
of its eggs and places them in the nest.
The eggs when laid soon become black
through contact with the charcoal, thus
deceiving nest-robbers who can’t distin-
guish the real from the dummy. In the
Cairns district I found a nest with three
eggs and three pieces of charcoal, and
the coals were so perfectly shaped that
only very close examination could reveal
the difference.
*.* * *
“K.M.F.”: When he asserts that de-
posits of sea shells found on Maoriland
mountaintops are the remains of feasts
left by some unknown race (B.
3/10/’34), “Mako” is barking up the
wrong tree. According to geologists,
M.L. was once beneath the waves, and
they regard the deposits of shell as a
proof. In any case, shells are found in
districts which reveal no trace of previous
human habitation —-Central Otago, for
example.
* * * *
“Puss”: It has long been said of the
hare in Australia that its natural ten-
dency to produce not more than two
leverets at a birth —in Europe, two are
a rarity—would always prevent it from
becoming a pest like the rabbit. Abo.
readers may have noted of late reports
of hare drives rendered necessary by the
increasing numbers of an animal that in
its normal state is a solitary. One Vic-
torian naturalist, who has been devoting
attention to the subject, says that many
of the hares he has dissected had as
many as four young ones in embryo.
This suggests that the hare, strengthened
by plentiful food and a mild climate,
may become as great a danger as the
swarming rabbit in days to come.
* H= * *
“Marker”: “Ornithos” (B. 26/9/’34)
says he has never known two eagle chicks
to reach maturity together. One pair at
Evesham station (Longreach, Q.) and an-
other at Tullamore (N.S.W.) were killed
by me just before being able to fly. The
N.S.W. brood measured 6ft. 3in. and
sft. 9in. respectively from tip to tip.
* * * *
“Fitzcray”: Melbourne papers have
been snowed under of late by experi-
enced bushmen who have seen kan-
garoos growing on the mothers’ teats, one
authority stating that one he saw was
“as small as a No. 6 shot” —say a pin-
head. The controversy has mercifully
switched over to whether the mother
kangaroo when pursued by the hunters
ejects her infant from the pouch by
a contraction of that organ, gives
him a telepathic tip to hop it on his own
account, or just buzzes him out as the
prodigal son was thrown. Curious to
say, the first two fantasies have plenty
of adherents, and the last, which
chronicles the actual happening, is ig-
nored. On Sunday morning in the off
season in western Queensland, my tribe
habitually hunted the numerous kan-
garoos with fast horses and fast dogs. A
hundred times, riding right up to a
heavily-laden doe, I have seen her
at short range take the passenger by the
scruff with both hands and heave him to
one side or another. The smaller rejects
always lay doggo for mother to return.
The bigger fellows sometimes tried a bit
of hopping on their own, which gener-
ally led to their finish by some lagging
tyke.
* * * *
“O’CampbeU”: Cicadas (B. 24/10/’34)
stop and start with a pre-arranged light
signal. In New England (N.S.W.) the
deafening chirrup starts as the sun sinks
and stops automatically as dusk and night
meet —I’ve tested them time and again.
In Queensland the reedy droning com-
mences about 7 p.m. and leaves off two
hours after to the minute. As “Kerys”
says, it’s an automatic procedure, as no
sound signal could pierce the din.
* * * *
“Pauw”: Failure to protect the plain
turkey and the ibis is one of the con-
tributing causes to the grasshopper
plague; so I support “Gryllas” (B.
17/10/’34), These birds are huge con-
sumers of the pest, both in the crawling
and flying stages, while the long-billed
ibis, digging in the soil, devours millions
of the unhatched eggs. In Queensland
years ago the spectacle of a flock of 400
or 500 ibises quartering a paddock was a
common sight. To-day it is rare to meet
with a dozen. In the days of big runs
the uneatable ibis was never interfered
with, and, though the turkey often found
his way to the dinner-table, he was so
plentiful that judicious shooting did no
harm. To-day, with closer settlement
and hundreds of yahoos uninstructed in
sportsmanlike ethics murdering everything
in sight with cheap guns or pea-rifles,
both birds are vanishing fast.

“Booraby”: A happy haven for per-
sons who want to live in retirement like
Murrumbidgee whalers is Poole Island,
eight miles from Bowen (Q.). The place
once had a meatworks, which failed for
lack of fresh water. Since then it has
been the luxuriant haunt of wild pigs,
scrub turkeys, pigeons, geese, ducks and
other wildfowl. The rocks are covered
with oysters, and the surrounding waters
teem with many kinds of fish, including
coral salmon, kingfish, barramundi, giant
trevalli and huge prawns, whilst Barrier
turtles come ashore at certain places to
lay their eggs. Duck eggs are also plenti-
ful. In fact, the food supply in all sea-
sons of the year is inexhaustible.
* * * H=
“Cudgerie”: I’m not surprised that the
Rewan stall-fed stallions (B. 24/10/’34)
died of starvation en route to Charle-
ville. It all depends upon what tucker
a.prad gets used to. Lots of grass-fed
horses won’t look at chaff or corn at
first. Bush nags used to the gilgais and
waterholes will often jib at a trough,
and a city-reared hack will shy at his
own reflection seen in a waterhole for
tb first time. Sheep are miles worse.
Have known ’em to cross a running
stream after rain to get to their usual
drinking troughs near the station bore.
* * * *
“Dai R.”: Waratah cuttings aren’t the
only ones in which striking is expedited
by the insertion of a grain of wheat in
the slit stem end (B. 24/10/’34). When
the late Dick Chase was manager df
Llanillo station, Walgett (N.S.W.), he
used the device to facilitate the striking
of saltbush in a previously saltbushless
area, and although the season was a dry
one had only five failures in a host of
plants.
* * * *
“Bitter Bark”: A feature of tropic
nights in far N.Q. is the insistent call of
the nightjar, known throughout the
North as the carpenter-bird. Its resound-
ing notes strongly resemble the blows of
a carpenter’s hammer.
* * * *
“Pick”: Customarily white-ants, for
protection against enemies, work entirely
in the dark. At times a lifting slab or
widening split exposes the works, and
immediately a black-ant colony pushes
in to assume control of the termite in-
dustry. The white-ants are not fighters.
They submit to the invaders, under whose
direction they continue to excavate tun-
nels, galleries and nurseries for both
swarms. Gradually all the works neces-
sary for the upkeep of the united
colonies are performed by the white
slaves and, instead of collecting pro-
vender as they formerly did, the black
providers now kill the white workers for
food. The outcome is disastrous. The
blacks fail to regulate the butchery to
keep pace with the birth-rate, and the
whites dwindle, creating famine amongst
their improvident masters. Both colonies
ultimately cease to exist.
THERE’S WORSE THAN TM.
Wc argue round the fire o’ nights, as fellows
do and always will,
About the cussedness of Sam, the imbecilities
of Bill.
And at the end you’re apt to hear the summary
of drover. Jim:
“1 wouldn’t say you chaps are wrong, but,
spare me days! there’s worse than ’im.”
He never makes it like a contradiction in our
faces hurled;
Merely a mild reminder that it takes a lot to
make a world,
And o’er the debit entries in a book it’s only
fair to skim
So you can stretch a point and say: “Well,
anyhow, there’s worse than ’im.”
It doesn’t seem to matter much at whom hard
epithets are flung,
A parsimonious squatter or an over-avaricious
Bung.
But, when the din of tongues has stilled, a
voice will cut the silence grim
With: “Like enough you blokes are right, but,
still ’n’ all, there’s worse than ’im.”
Old Jim has knocked about a bit, from Bun-
bury to Bungaree,
And seen far more of men and things, it’s
clear, than chaps like you and me.
He’s seventy if he’s a day, and, though his eyes
are growing dim, *
We never think to doubt his word when he
avers “There’s worse than ’im.”
And somehow I’ve a haunting hope that when I
climb the Golden Stair,
And Peter takes my record and frowns darkly

“Neurosis”: A fearful commotion
under the washhouse dragged me out of
bed. At least, it woke the missus, and she
did the rest. Variously armed, we went to
have a look-see. An old Muscovy duck
with a dozen or more eggs under her
was having a round or two with a
moon-snake—a fellow about 6ft. long.
Those left hooks of hers were worth
dodging—so effective that if wasn’t fair
on my part to take a hand. I wasn’t
fair. After that lot was over I expected
a vote of thanks from the old duck. Did
I get it? I did not. The old girl waddled
off her eggs and wanted to know if I’d
like some more of the same. I de-
clined and retreated. Now, if that had
been a human being, first of all she’d
have told the world about her argu-
ment with the snake; she’d have had
her picture taken ; it would have taken
her three hours to settle herself and
three days to recover. Not so the duck.
She returned to her nest, pulled her
scattered eggs under her —including the
one I’d taken from the belly of the
snake—and in less than three ticks was
brooding again in the quiet contentment
of a sitting mother and with not one
feather quivering.
“Airline”: The low stunted mulga of
Central Australia is peculiarly adapted
to the arid region it grows in. Its roots
are long and straight, in marked con-
trast to the gnarled and twisted limbs
above ground. Only by this fortuitous
provision is the tree enabled to survive,
the wider root area giving it more susten-
ance. In many parts these roots are the
only material available to the aborigines
for spear shafts, the tip, a separate niece,
“I’m sorry, but we’ve destroyed it."
“All right, then; tell the quack no appendix no twenty quid."
also being made from mulga. Fire-har-
dened, it is bound to the long shaft with
kangaroo sinews. To make them soft
and pliable, these are often chewed for
days by the myalls before being used.

“Top-rail”: There appear to be two
breeds of spinifex (B. 17/10/’34)—the
small variety, which grows about a foot
high, and the porcupine-grass, which
flourishes in huge spiny clumps often as
tall as a horse and impenetrable to any-
thing bar tractors or war-tanks. Cattle
and horses will sometimes eat the former
variety, and camels like it almost as well
as poley-bush, a curse they have spread.
No animal will tackle the porcupine-
grass. The Kalkadoons of Queensland’s
nor’-west, besides using spinifex for
making signal fires, once used the resin-
ous gum for binding their stone-age
weapons.

“W.T.”: On the shores of Wonboyn
Lake, South Coast (N.S.W.), there are
English trees which look strangely out
of place amongst the Australian timber.
Some relatives of the victims of the Ly-ee-
moon sent out young trees to be planted
over the graves at Green Cape, near the
lighthouse ; but as the sea was too rough
for landing they were planted on Won-
boyn Point.

“Eureka”: “Beats me how these
astronomer blokes know when there’s
goin’ ter be an eclipse,” said Dave. “They
can tell yer right to the minute when it’s
goin’ ter happen.” “I can’t see anything
wonderful about it,” Dad replied.
“They’ve got eyes ter read the news-
papers same as we have. I saw about
this in the papers weeks ago.” And Dad
gazed again through his bit of smoked
glass at the eclipse of the sun.
“Speargrass”: White-ant nests
may burn all right (B.
31/10/’34), but I’ve never
known Binghi to resort to them
for kindling purposes in the
N.Q. scrub country. No matter
how wet the season the abo.
can always get dry firewood
from dead timber that remains
standing, chipping through the
bark on the side where the rain
beats the least. Then there is
sandalwood, usually available,
and which will always burn;
also the kerosene-bush. During
the wet Binghi becomes less
nomadic, and the fires in his
more regular camping grounds
are often kept burning for weeks on end.

"Homfrey Beale”: Papuan tribes
whose only means of ingress to enemy
country is by water attach much
prophetic significance to the movements
of fish seen on a voyage of offence. If
a fish springs from the seaward side of
the water into the boat it is regarded as
a certain augury of ambush and assas-
sination for the raiders ; but if a fish
comes from the landward side it signi-
fies the fleeing to the scrub-fastnesses of
the tribe about to be attacked, with its
implication of loot (including young
brides) for the attackers. (These two
beliefs in particular have, twisted the his-
tory of many tribes from what it' might
have been.) If fish spring across the
front of a boat it indicates that the com-
ing of the attackers is known and stub-
born resistance will be met with; if
across its wake, that the advantage of
surprise will be with the raiders.

“Nosyd”: The white-hot stones to boil
the billy of “Cam Cove” (B. 29/8/’34)
are not as safe as “Monaro Mick” and
his paper billy (B. 15/8/’34). White-hot
stones thrown into cold water are very
likely to burst into fragments; what
could happen to your eyesight is easily
imagined. However, I’d like to know the
sort of bushman who’d have no billy
with him and yet a supply of paper
bags.
“W.P.T.”: Koalas are mortally afraid
of thunder. At the first clap the little
creatures make for shelter, uttering a
peculiar frightened growl, and remain
scared until the storm is over.
THIS YEAR'S GRADUATE : "Well, sonny, which is it? The posterior molar or
the upper bicuspid?”
“Theodolite”: Emus are certainly short
of brains (B. 24/10/’34), but they are
the most intensely inquisitive creatures.
Running levels for bore-drains in the
Flinders River (Q.) country, toiling in
waist-high Mitchell grass and plagued
with flies, we would periodically be
driven to greater profanity by the un-
welcome attentions of the huge birds.
At starting time in the morning they
would appear in the distance, and,
gradually working in, would every now
and then turn their heads from side to
side as they regarded us with first one
eye and then the other. Their eyesight
must be phenomenal;
through the telescope of
the theodolite I have
seen them engaged in
this eye-by-eye form of
espionage at distances
well over a mile. Soon
we would have several
mobs ai'ound us. They
would venture to. with in
a few feet, repeatedly
obstructing our view of
the staff, and if an in-
strument was left un-
attended a few minutes
they would knock it over
in their efforts to swal-
low the bright brass
thumbscrews. One of
our chainmen tied a
tomahawk head to a
length of clothesline, and
using this bolero fashion,
succeeded in hobbling
one of our tormentors.
Risking his steam-
hammer kicks, we tied
the red flag from a
sighting-peg to his tail,
and in a few minutes he
was streaking for the horizon with the
whole mob in hot pursuit. But, sure
enough, the rest of them were in close
attendance again next morning.

“E.W.C.”: Englishmen still seem to
have peculiar ideas about Australia. I
knew one in Kentucky (N.S.W.), who
refused to walk abroad after dark with-
out a loaded shotgun. We patiently tried
to explain that Ned Kelly and Thunder-
bolt had been dead for years ; but it was
no good. The cure we arranged fixed
him, though it was intended as a lark.
Half a dozen bullock skulls were pro-
cured and set op fence-posts along his
accustomed route, and into each we put
a lighted candle. The effect after dark
was most unnerving, but Choom stuck
to his guns (or gun) and blazed away
fiercely before; he woke up. But don’t
mention bushrangers to him now unless
you’re looking for a fight.

“Jack Roo”: “Encue’s” tale (B.
10/10/’34) of wild pigs and his nervous
mate throws my memory back 30 years.
As a youngster on my first bush job I
camped on my own at Black Gate tank,
on Maneroo station (C.Q.). When I’d go
to bed at night I always hung a half-axe
over my bunk in the bit of a lean-to
that served as a humpy. I could, from
constant practice, put my hand on that
axe in any degree of darkness and in
any state of wakefulness. It wasn’t much
of a thing; but it gave me a heap of
moral support. One night there came an
awful commotion from outside. I didn’t
need to raise my hand—it was there al-
ready. My hair went up also. The
thing outside, whatever it was, grunted
and groaned, snorted, wheezed and
snarled. The sounds were getting worse.
So was J. As I always did have a hatred
of dying in an enclosed space, the only
thing left for me to do was to finish in
the open. I grasped that axe and
bounded out —arm uplifted, hair on end,
mouth open, shirt-tails flapping, bare-
footed and bare-legged. Boadicea going
into action, as a moving picture, couldn’t
have been a patch on me. And the
cause of the disturbance and my upset
was only an old man ’roo coming in for
his nightly drink! I’ve often heard ’em
since and taken no notice of ’em ; but
if that first ’roo hasn’t stopped going
yet, and if he has maintained his initial
pace, he must be several times round the
world by this and going strong on an-
other lap.

“Top-rail”: It happened in a N.Q.
town some years ago. Blank, the butcher,
found himself before the Court charged
with the unlawful possession of a bul-
lock. As the beast was found in Blank’s
slaughteryards the case seemed strong.
During the night the bullock, main ex-
hibit in the case, was closely guarded
in a paddock by a young policeman
strange to the district. On hearing some
agonised bellowing from the direction
of the waterhole he hurried down to find
exhibit “A” being torn to pieces by two
crocodiles. Next morning Blank was
discharged.
“Lugger’s Mate”: Visitors to some
Torres Strait islands, particularly the
Murray group, are always interested in
the big stone fishtraps that run out from
the shores on the eastern or s.-e. sides.
It is surprising that no serious attempt
has been made to ascertain their age,
although folklore holds that they were
originally built by- god-men or men-
gods, which explains why they are
guarded (and rebuilt after trade-wind
ravages) with a sort of veneration by the
natives. They are of large lava blocks
nearly three feet high, so the gods must
have been more muscular than most gods
are.
FUEL FOR THE COPPER.
We drag them with us, wheresoe’er
We go, our shelves to curr\ber,
Those souvenirs of many a craze
That glorified our salad days,
Youth’s treasures, which we now appraise
As sentimental lumber.
The pamphlets that were truth itself,
The poems shot with magic;
The articles o’er which we pored,
The clippings that we saved and stored.
The photographs we cherished—Lord!
’Tis humorous, and tragic!
Those were the days we winged afar.
When every bloom held honey;
What if we were a trifle dense,
We lacked not leisure then nor pence.
But nqw, alas! we’ve only sense
And want both time and money.
We’re short of faith and fervor, too —
We’ve come too many a cropper—
We push about from place to place
This flotsam from our years of grace:
It bores us now; takes too much space;
We think about the copper;
Yet hesitate, some mem’ry fond
Thoughts of destruction quashing;
Till comes the parting of the ways
And all the light of other days
Goes up in one last glorious blaze
To help to boil the washing!

THE MAN ON
THE LAND
THE STUFF TO GIVE'EM
MEGGITTS LINSEED MEAL
MORE EFFICIENT CLASSING.
“Mouton”: “Fergus” (B. 10/10/’34)
misconstrued my statement in two main
points. Firstly, that two men to one
rolling table are required for four
shearers. I referred to average shearers,
not to big guns, and I do not suggest
that the pair should just skirt and roll
the fleeces. They must attend to the
bellies, stained pieces, backs, etc. I
have applied this method in practice, and
under widely varying conditions I have
found that woolroom hands can be
worked most efficiently on rolling tables.
When sufficient tables are available the
fleeces can be kept off the floor and
more carefully treated, and the skirtings
can go directly into separate baskets —
neck pieces to their own end and the
stains to the other.
Regarding Ist and 2nd pieces, correct
skirting means the separation of the in-
ferior portions from the superior, and
if the men are made to skirt round the
shoulder, as “Fergus” suggests, there
should be no first pieces, which are
only necks wherr fleeces are overskirted.
I, along with many other practical
woolmen, have come to the conclusion
that large lines of good average pieces
will bring a better price than when
divided into 2nd and Ist. “Broken” is
never justified except when super fleeces
are heavily-skirted to piece them.
“Fergus’s” reference to necks is out
of date. Thirty years ago necks were
valued on the same limits as fleece wool,
but now they are on the same limits
as other skirtings. To remove neck
wool unless burry or matted is definitely
wrong, as it means degrading light, bright
wool to a class which is valued on a
lower limit than fleece wool.
CRUTCHINGS.
“R. E. Combing”: Most men think it
is not worth while to sort crutchings.
“Bung it off the board into the bale”
is the usual motto. They’re wrong.
Many modern French mills have the
machinery for combing bulky locks or
crutchings, and, of course, if they get
what they want in the way of bulk they
can give higher value than for the mixed
and short descriptions, which go to the
carbonising and clothing departments.
It is not a difficult or lengthy process
to deal with crutchings. Place on the
table, not too much at a time, shake
loose, then pick out the bulkiest stuff—
lin. or l|in. in length—and throw it
into a separate basket. The shaking will
usually bring bulk to the top, so that it
is easily picked up. Remove the heavy
stains or dags from the balance and
sweep it into another basket with the
hands.
Crutching wool does not take up much
room, and there is no need to get it away
quickly as there is with the main clip.
Therefore, the man who does without
assistance at crutching time can let it
lie in a heap and go back to it again
and again whenever he has a spare half-
day or so. He will be surprised to find
how much he can get done in those odd
half-days.
PART-TENDER WOOLS.
“Narooma”: “Marsh” (B. 31/10/’34)
is drastic when he states that a classer
who doesn’t test a fleece for soundness
in at least four different places doesn’t
know his job.
When over 1400 fleeces a day are hit-
ting the table, the classer has neither the
time nor thd space to open every fleece
and sound it—neither is there any need.
An odd fleece, sound on the shoulder
and slightly tender elsewhere, may get
past him, but, except in a specialty clip,
it will not do much damage.
The experienced man knows where the
first symptoms will be found. The belly
wool is usually the first place to go
tender, but that does not affect the hand-
ling of the fleece. He will naturally test
first on the shoulder, then turn to the
back wool.
Sheep running on open or dusty
country have nearly all mushy or wefty
backs, while the rest of the fleece may be
perfectly sound. It pays to take the backs
out.
Many fleeces have a break near the
base or tip of the staple. The latter fault
often occurs in sheep that have been
badly dipped. If the break is within £in.
of the end there is no need to throw out
the fleece as tender except among
specialty wools. The staple will still
possess good combing length, its only
defect being a slightly higher percentage
of noil.
BETTER WOOLPACKS.
“Murrawong”: The complaints of
manufacturers about the pollution of
wool through the inclusion of jute ravel-
lings off the pack have resulted in many
attempts to evolve a perfect pack.
Strands of jute from seams damage
wool combs and absorb dye to the same
extent as wool. The blemishes they form
in woven material detract from its value.
Some inventors suggest the subsniuuon
of woollen packs for jute. Others favor
stout paper, reinforced with wire-netting,
and such modifications of the jute pack
as woollen and paper linings.
The woollen pack cost too much,
and could not keep its shape. After press-
ing the bale expanded.
Other experiments have also failed to
conform with requirements, but many
promising schemes have appeared and
faded away, chiefly because of expense.
Even if a perfect pack were marketed
costing, say, 20 per cent, dearer, the extra
cost would have to be borne by the wool-
grower, and he could not hope to be re-
imbursed by better prices for his clip.
The least a buyer can offer is |d. per
pound on any lot—that would amount to
6s. to Bs. per bale —and leading buyers
have expressed the opinion that no manu-
facturer would consider the idea.
If all woolpacks were finished and
folded with seams outside it would ob-
viate pollution of the wool with ravellings.
VARIEGATED WOOL.
“Valerin”: Reports of divers hued
merino fleeces come from several parts
of N. S. Wales. I have seen a couple of
samples; one from Moree, which shows
a dusty tip, then a one-eighth band of
silvery brightness, the balance being a
deep chocolate. The other, from a
western N.S.W. property, has alternate
markings of natural white and brown
right to the tip.
Reversion is responsible for the occa-
sional black, brown and spotted sheep
which appear in the most carefully bred
flocks, but these latest freaks seem to
be something different.
It would be interesting to submit the
samples to polariscopic examination to
discover whether there is any structural
differences in the fibre to account for
the colors.
DIPS AND FLYTRAPS.
“Peggoty”: “Plaster” and “Sprinkler”
(B. 24/10/’34) both quote Lake Nash
country as being suitable for the instal-
lation of concrete dips ; but this does not
alter the fact that they are out of the
question on our loose, open N.Q. downs.
If “Sprinkler” has never seen a line of
fencing which needed to be resunk
through ground swelling, he’s lucky. Our
gidya posts periodically need attention
through this cause, and our fencers know
enough to put the larger end in the
ground. Reverse them, and their own
weight will cause them to topple over in
“the wet.” As for an iron dip, I assisted
in “pigstying” one of these with bush
timber and staying it across the top, to
make it serviceable after its first wet
season.
Because “G.F.D.” (B. 24/10/’34)
tended one flytrap for 12 months, he
claims they are useless. To be of any
use to sheepgrowers it needs all hands
thoroughly on the job, and that does
not mean “one man, one trap.” Within
the last few days, by regulation, the
Queensland Government has made it
compulsory, under severe penalties, for
every fruitgrower in stipulated areas to
instal up to 10 flytraps per acre, and
this on top of years of intense spraying.
Pity they do not give the same attention
to the industry that keeps Australia on
the map.
HEALTH AND THE FLY.
“Warramulla”: A supreme factor in
the blowfly discussion has been over-
looked. Keeping sheep healthy is more
important than getting the correct jetting
mixture.
It is among the tails of sick and lame
ones that the fly starts his pranks. The
strong sheep, go to the lead and usually
get off scot-free. Some owners run a
“hospital” paddock, into which the ailing
ones are drafted. But many cannot afford
this, and with big areas the sick ones have
to take their chance. Some sheep should
be born with a lifebuoy around their
necks—they are always in peril.
A suitable lick is a great help to
health when feed is getting dry. Then
there is such a thing as sheep getting
“paddock stale.” The remedy is to move
them round.
Beware the fantailed concertina
breeched jumbuck—he is the fly’s best
friend.
FLAG-SMUT EXPERIMENTS.
“Hope Vale”: Some experts consider
flag the worst disease of wheat. It is
estimated that in N. S. Wales a loss of
3 p.c. per annum is caused by it;
in a 50,000,000-bushel harvest, 1,500,000
bushels.
At the Temora Experiment Farm,
the plant-breeder, Mr. Doman, is making
large-scale experiments in an endeavor
to produce a flat, smut-resistant variety.
Varieties of known resistance such as
Nabawa are crossed with others. The
products of these crosses are subjected to
a dusting with flag-smut spores, planted
in single rows and the degree of infection
noted.
Wheats have been imported from
India, Canada and the U.S.A. and sub-
jected to smut-resistance tests.
Some of our new varieties, such as
Bobbin, show little resistance to flag
smut, while some of the old favorites,
like Federation and Purple Straw, are so
vulnerable that they show 90 p.c. infec-
tion.
Individual farmers should be able to
do something to help.
QUALITY WHEAT.
“Valerin”: If “G.L.” (B. 31/10/’34)
and others are correct that Australia
should not grow quality wheats, isn’t it
queer that departmental plant-breeders
are concentrating on producing these
varieties —such as Dundee —and that
millers are providing prizes for them?
Of course, English millers are not
looking for our quality wheats —for the
simple reason they cannot get them in
sufficient quantity to make it worth
while. In any case, our handling
methods do not encourage grading for
quality.
We could increase our Asiatic trade
if shipments of first-class wheat could
be guaranteed.
Farmers are getting out of the rut,
but they have a long way to go.
PLOUGH V. CULTIVATOR.
“Sorghum”: A recent discussion by
inspectors of the N.S.W. Agricultural
Department resulted in favor of
ploughing.
Most orchardists support this view,
though some favor the cultivator because
of its usefulness in checking evaporation
by quickly pulverising the crust after rain.
It certainly does that, but too frequent
cultivation gives the soil a fineness that
prevents free capillary action.
Constant use of the cultivator also
tends to form a sole pan, and where
weeds have to be eradicated the culti-
vator cannot reach the roots in the pan.
Each subsequent cultivation develops a
more shallow mulch.
Points in favor of the plough for
summer cultivation are that a more en-
during and deeper mulch is obtained.
Weeds do not require such frequent atten-
tion ; water percolates more readily into
the soil; loss of surface soil is reduced
to a minimum.
To prevent the plough upsetting levels
in irrigation country, remove the mould-
boards. And ploughing will not injure
tree roots if the plough is used right
from the start. A deeper mulch is
obtained and roots prevented from form-
ing too close to the surface.
THE COST OF ENSILAGE.
“Aparcatus”: “Spring’s” remark (B.
24/10/ ’34) that lucerne ensilage is more
costly to make than hay puts his advice
into the discard.
G. W. Walker (B. 17/10/’34) quotes
A. Brunskill’s estimate of the cost
at 3s. to 4s. per ton. Hay cannot be
stacked for less than 10s. per ton, even
using the methods advocated by
“Spring.”
By using tipdrays instead of waggons
or sweep rakes, Mr. Brunskill’s cost can
be considerably lowered.
At each corner of the body of the
dray an upright about 3ft. high is wired
to the guardrail. To the uprights a rail
is wired along each side and front. The
back is left open, and no tailboard is
used. By building an upright frame,
lOcwt. to 12cwt. of green lucerne can be
put on to an ordinary cubic yard tip-
dray. When the dray is tipped, the whole
load falls clear.
The dray is brought right into the pit
and the load tipped off. It is then driven
out the other end of the pit, turned and
brought back over the lucerne. This

BACKACHE
Makes you Look and Feel so Old
HERE IS SOUND ADVICE
But act quickly. Get a box of De Witt’s Kidney and
Bladder Pills from your chemist, and take them as directed. This
is the right thing to do, for De Witt’s Pills contain ingredients
which enable your kidneys to extract the harmful uric acid from
your system —just as Nature intended they should —and when
you get rid of this harmful uric acid, your back will cease aching.
Nothing else will do. You cannot obtain the same results
by any other means. Rubbing with embrocations or liniments
would probably aggravate the trouble, and add to your suffering.
But relief quickly follows the use of De Witt’s Kidney and
Bladder Pills, and you know the pain is not likely to return,
because, by taking De Witt’s Pills, you have got rid of the cause.
ACT QUICKLY
Don’t wait, or the pain will get worse. Don’t experiment with
things you think may do you good. Get the remedy that has
been used with success all over the world for nearly fifty years.
Heed the good advice of those who have already
used the remedy.
Watch for such symptoms as puffiness
under the eyes, heaviness of the limbs,
swollen feet or ankles, foul breath,
scalding pains, gravel or stone. These
symptoms usually precede attacks of
Rheumatism, Backache, Sciatica, Lum-
bago or serious Kidney Trouble, and
much suffering and expense may be
saved by quickly getting a box of De
Witt’s Kidney and Bladder Pills, price
3/6, or larger, more economical size, 6/6
from your chemist to-day.

helps to pack the silo. It is essential
that a man should be kept spreading in
the pit.
In October, 1933, I filled a 100-ton pit
with lucerne, the cost (filling only) being
Is. 9d. per ton. Working four men and
four drays, one man spreading in the
pit and one man mowing and raking, the
job was completed in 20 working hours.
The lucerne was built up 4ft. above
surface and earth scooped over the top.
Within three weeks, it had settled to
within 6in. of surface level, when it was
completely covered.
The pit is in the centre of the paddock,
and the longest draw was not more
than 400 yards.
ENSILAGE IN DRY AREAS.
“Stump Jump”: We in dry belts
can’t grow sorghum or maize like the
coastal man or lucerne like the river-
fiat owner. Lucerne is worth while only
in rare seasons, and then only gives a
thin first cut and a scrubby aftergrowth.
But oats or wheat are worth growing
for silage. I’ve found flaggy varieties
like Mulga and Sunrise oats and Turvey
wheat the most useful.
Cut Turvey with the binder at the
maximum growth stage when the grain is
fully developed and milky, and there is
no sign of dryness setting in.
Oats are preferable, but not by much.
Cut late in the afternoon to cart between
seven o’clock and twelve next morning.
It doesn’t pay to hustle ; the best en-
silage is made slowly.
The sheaves make for quick loading
and filling of the pit. Make loose rows
as ixi stack work, being careful to leave
hay bands exposed. As each row is com-
pleted cut and pull out every band—this
is important. Fill until there is as much
above ground as below.
When the pit is full, leave a day and,
if possible, shovel about 2in. of earth
over the whole top.
The sheaf method doesn’t require
tramping.
Another filling method is by a port-
able chaffcutter placed in the middle of
the pit’s long side. A fast gear is needed
to chop the stuff into 2in. lengths, and
you must leave the bottom of the cutter
fully open. Sheets of plain galvanised-
iron bent at the sides can be arranged
as a chute for a wooden pusher to de-
liver anywhere in the pit.
This method makes beautiful quality
silage. Gumming of the blades of the
cutter must be watched for.
The shape of the pit has a deal to do
with good silage, too. Unless the bottom
is flat all the way the pressure will be
uneven and the quality will vary. Fill-
ing by sheaves, you don’t need to take
the dray or lorry in, so the entry and
exit slopes don’t matter. The sides
must be perpendicular to avoid drag in
the sinkage. The pit should be at least
six feet deep ; otherwise you fail to get
the necessary pressure.
FOR SORE BACKS.
“Horsey”: Pour a bottle of malt
vinegar into an enamel saucepan and
heat until too hot to put your hand in.
Keep at this heat whilst you stir in loz.
powdered alum and 4oz. common salt.
See that the alum is dissolved before
adding the salt, and stir well. Bottle as
soon as “breaking” heat has gone off,
and keep stoppered.
Wash the prad’s back with hot water
thoroughly, and gently rub in the mixture
as hot as possible. Be sure to stir whilst
heating it. The residue can go back into
the bottle. The animal must not be
ridden whilst this treatment is in pro-
gress, but the cure is a permanent one
for “set-fasts,” etc. It should not take
more than 14 days' in a bad case before
the prad is fit to use again.
“The Breaker”: Try this on the prad
with a sore back. Take a sugar-bag, sew
together the sides of the open end, and
split down the centre of the bag as one
does with a split bag—the old time
drovers “overlander.” Fill evenly with
horsehair padding on each side, leaving
that part of the bag fitting over the back-
bone free. Place under the saddle, taking
care that the split is uppermost. The
stuffed split bag will keep the saddle
well off the sore.
DEALING WITH NOOGOORA.
“B-gar”: Tell “Nedos” (B. 24/10/’34)
there’s no known way to deal with Noo-
goora. The seeds lie dormant for a long
time. They may not germinate with
normal rain, but when heavy rains give
the ground a good soaking there’ll be a
lovely crop should any seeds be about.
Chipping and hoeing are useless ; the
young plants must be pulled out by the
roots, raked together to dry and then
burnt. Every time a plant shows up it
mu ? be oust f d - Poisoning gives only
mediocre results, and is expensive.
Stock routes are Noogoora nurseries,

“H.U.C.”: Tell “Nedos” that the only
effective control of this pest is by sys-
tematic hand-pulling before it seeds.
Disc-cultivating will kill plants, but, as
it is well established that the structure
of the seed-pod is conducive to delayed
germination, it also germinates more
seed, and several discings will be required
for eradication.
HINTS FOR THE FARM.
“Wongi”: For brake-blocks on wag-
gons and drays, try a piece of grass-tree
bole. There is no need to leather-face it *
the fibre does the gripping. Used as stubs
for pigpens or sheepyards, grass-tree has
a long life and is white-ant proof, besides
being cheaply erected

a hole for the handle. Cut two wooden
plugs, slightly tapered, to fit the ends of
the piping.
“Wrash”: The easiest way to shape
cork is to hold it on the grindstone. If
a knife is used, keep the blade greased.
To cut rubber have the blade dripping
wet with water.
“Kyabra”: The blowfly trap made out
of a petrol-tin with gauze in three sides
stands supreme. To get access to the
dead flies without cutting the top of
the tin to form a lid take an empty
syrup-tin with the lid on, cut around it
lin. from the top, snip the removed top-
section every inch around and bend.
Cut a hole in the petrol-tin the same
size as the syrup-tin, and insert the
syrup-tin section, bending back every
second “slice” inside to hold it in place.
The lid of the syrup-tin serves as a door.
“Jakamaki”: Every sheepowner in
wormy country should periodically have
sheep-dropping specimens examined under
the microscope to identify worm para-
sites. A lot of energy is wasted in “hit-
or-miss” drenching.
“Sheepo”: New ground is usually free
from tetanus and malignant oedema
germs. Yards that are used continuously
may reek with them. With temporary
paddock brakes the risk of freshly-
marked lambs contracting disease through
inoculation is lessened. Brakes, too,
make for better mothering. Where
scrub or timber exists erect a marking
brake. After use it can be burnt. Prior
to next marking another can be erected
elsewhere in the paddock.
QUESTIONS ANSWERED.
{Transferred from Service Department.)
What can 1 mix with lime to make it remain
on shed walls? Will coarse salt help? If so.
what quantities, and how should it be mixed ?
—3871.
A good binder is 21b. zinc sulphate and lib.
of common salt to half a bushel of unslaked
lime. Salt should never be used in whitewash
for use on galvanised iron. A suitable binder
in this case is lib. of tallow to 141 b. of lump
lime. The tallow must be added whilst the
lime is boiling.

HOW TO TELL ’EM.
Let us help with some further infor-
mation as to how to tell a bushman in
town.
Bushmen are generally bearded. If
not, they are either moustached or
else clean-shaven. You can tell by look-
ing at their faces. A bushman never
does up the third-last button on his waist-
coat, because when you’ve got only three
buttons on your waistcoat it doesn’t do
to overwork them. A bushman always
wears a bootlace instead of a tie. He
wears his tie round his pants. Lastly,
and this is absolutely an infallible test,
a bushman in town always carries his
stockwhip under his left arm, and for
walking-out purposes wears box spurs
instead of the familiar swan-neck ones.
Before we close, we might as well tell
you how we tell a city man in the coun-
try. If we see a man walking along the
road with his swag, wearing a monocle,
spats, a fur coat and a fountain-pen
behind his ear, we immediately say to
ourselves, “By Jupiter and Diana, it
appears to me that that guy over there
is a citizen.”
Dad and Dave.
LEAVE US OUR LEGENDS.
“The story that King John lost both his
crown and his jewels in the Wash has been be-
lieved for centuries, but it appears that they
were hidden in the grounds of Rockingham
Castle.” —Adelaide “Advertiser.”
This is most disconcerting news. One
by one all our cherished illusions are
being shattered.
We have long real-
ised that John died,
not of a surfeit of
peaches and mulled
wine, but of hard-
ened arteries, and
that Alfred, far
from burning the
cakes, was actually
instrumental in
pointing out to the
good wife the fact
that they were done
to a turn.
It has, moreover,
been definitely estab-
lished that Richard
Crookback did not
offer his kingdom to
a horse ; while only
recently a learned
authority proved
that, contrary to the
accepted story,
Charles I. walked
and talked half an
hour before, not
after, his head was
cut off.
But the Wash
story has heretofore
gone unquestioned,
and I wish to regis-
ter an emphatic pro-
test against any tampering with it. Its
strongest point is its feasibility.
.Having regard to the fact that John was
notoriously a careless man, the truth of
the tale seems not only likely, but almost
inevitable, when one considers the thou-
sands of studs and sleeve-links that are
lost in the same way every year.

GOLF TACTICS.
“Match tactics, is it?” said Parafin.
“Well, when I was playing Skagen for
the championship of the universe, we
both used all the tactics we knew.
“I won the first, after treading his
ball into the mud, but he evened
things at the second by kicking mine into
a bunker. The third was halved in eights,
and the play went on all square to the
twelfth, where I fired my revolver at a
crow just as Skagen was putting—result,
his ball skated across the green, over the
next fairway and finished under a flax-
bush.
“The rest of the morning round was
halved, and at lunch I was one up,
thanks to tactics. The first 16 holes of
the afternoon were halved, but at the
17th came the masterpiece of the day’s
play. I was addressing my ball when I
noticed Skagen had taken out his shot-
gun. Was I perturbed? No, I came
slowly back, eye on the ball; but instead
of starting the down swing I paused.
Skagen fired, and I stood back and
laughed. Was I put off? No! I quietly
shaped up again, and was just about to
connect when he fired again. With
superb tactics he had rung in a double-
barrelled shotgun. All square and one
to go.
“I had to think fast. Arriving at
the 18th tee, I called in a stage whisper
for my brassie, and stood facing a green
about 225 yards off. Skagen took his
spoon, and with a glorious shot finished
within 10 feet of the pin. Then I turned
round, swapped my brassie for a mashie-
niblick, and landed within two feet of
the pin on the 18th. Skagen had played
to the 16th green. He took a five against
my two, and the championship was mine.
A triumph of tactics.”

THE MARVEL.
Along that narrow ledge, where there
was barely space sufficient for one foot
at a time, and the negotiation of which
might well have tested the agility of a
mountain goat, he swung, fully aware
that one false step might plunge him to
destruction. He had performed this acro-
batic turn countless times without mis-
hap, and he sometimes wondered if the
public which paid him for the exhibition
would greatly care if his superlative
nerve ever failed him. None knew better
than he how fickle the public was.
Hanging on now only with tautened
knees, leaving his hands free, he main-
tained a perfect balance, body and brain
in complete understanding.
No applause, however, greeted this
wonderful effort in acrobatics.
After all, it would seem a bit queer to
have the Sydney travelling public ap-
plauding tram conductors every time they
ventured along the footboards pulling
tickets!

/ wish I could escape the cares
Of humdrum, workaday affairs
And live a lone, nomadic life
Away from city stress and strife.
I long to build a leafy shack
Beside some stream or rural track
Where I may dream and moon around
And spread my couch upon the ground.
Ah, I would heed the wander lure
With carefree heart, if I were sure
That by forsaking toil and such
I’d not miss ease and comfort much!

PEEPS AT THE PROFESSIONS.
XII. — THE CRITIC.
See the critic, pained and blase,
Half asleep and bored to tears
By a show which common people
Greet with loud applause and cheers.
Virtuosos at his comments
Tremble ; prima donnas faint;
While the novelist and artist
Learn they cannot write or paint.
He’s held the floor for long enough
It’s time that someone called his bluff.
A critic is a man who can tell just
what is wrong with a work of art. The
work of art may be a painting, a grand
opera, a novel, a musical comedy, a
talkie or a book of verse —it is all the
same to him. He will pick out its weak
spot with an infallible finger. It is no
good saying “Suppose there is no weak
spot?” The proof of the pudding is in
the eating, and if you place your work
of art before him he will do the rest.
If you are not satisfied that the spot
pointed out is weak go to another critic
and he will show you another one. You
can then take your choice.
It is difficult to see where critics get
all their knowledge from, because no
critic can ever paint, sing, act or write
(except criticisms). Perhaps it’s a gift.
Certainly they never pay for it.
A critic leads a busy life. Take a
typical day. In the morning, after writ-
ing up his criticisms held over from the
day before, he ambles along to an Art
Exhibition. Giving but a passing glance
to the pictures that are attracting most
attention he loiters in front of one that
everyone else seems to be ignoring. This,
he decides, is the picture of the year.
A hasty note, and he is outside again,
just in time for the Early Shoppers’ Ses-
sion of a new film.
Judging by the audience it is an up-
roariously funny picture. They laugh
unrestrainedly throughout. The critic
is unmoved; in fact, frankly bored.
“Humorless” he jots down, “A weari-
some performance devoid of the slight-
est glimmer of a laugh.” The second
picture is different. Well before the end
there is a steady procession towards the
door. At the conclusion
the ushers awaken those
that remain. “An excel-
lent show,” comments
the critic.
Then to lunch. A hur-
ried meal, for he has
much work before him.
Through force of habit
he notes “Soup —thin
and weak ; rabbit-pie—
lacking in tone; roast
lamb utterly uncon-
vincing ; cabinet pudding
—trite.” In a spirit of
generosity he adds:
“The table napkins are
the whitest I have ever
seen.”
After a musical-comedy
matinee —“music tuneless, ballets stiff' and
gags pre-war”—he is in a happy frame of
mind when he approaches the home of
the child prodigy one-stringed ukulele
player. He has no hesitation in predict-
ing for her a career rivalling those of
the great masters, provided of course
she loses none of her talent during the
30 years which he estimates will be neces-
sary for her to study before her debut.
He still has a violin recital and a meet-
ing of a Verse-Reading Society to cover,
but these are child’s play. An early
supper finds him in bed by midnight with
two new novels and a book of verse to
skim through before dropping olf.
When criticising a painting a critic
never speaks of color, light and shade,
line or perspective. These terms he keeps
for musical criticisms, while for a paint-
ing he employs terms which the lay mind
would associate with a pianoforte recital
or a book.
The true test of a critic is the extent
to which he can apply to one form of
art, the stock terms of another branch.
If he can’t do this well he will incur
the violent criticism of his fellow-critics.
The critic’s motto, of course, is:
“The Public is always wrong.”

What constitutes wife-desertion in Vic. ? If
the husband and wife are still friendly, though
living apart, would it prejudice their desire for
a divorce 3—4132.
Under the Divorce Act (Vic.) it is provided
that when the husband or wife, as the case may
be, has without just cause or excuse wilfully
deserted the petitioner for divorce, and left
him or her continuously so deserted during
three years and upwards, the Court may grant
a divorce. Where friendly relations exist
between the parties, the fact of non-cohabita-
tion does not of itself furnish ground for
divorce. A divorce cannot be obtained merely
on the expressed wish of the parties.
A man died intestate in Birmingham {Eng-
land), leaving a wife but no children. He has
several sisters still living. (1) Does the widow
inherit the whole estate , or are the sisters en-
titled to part ? (2) Are the children of sisters
who pre-deceased the brother entitled to par-
ticipate ? —4084.
Under English law the widow would be en-
titled to £lOOO and all the “personal chattels”;
the residue, if any, of the estate would then
go to the widow for life and on her death to
the sisters equally. Nephews and nieces take
among them the share their deceased parents
would have taken.
Is a member of a society within his rights
in ci iticising items in an audited balance sheet
unanimously adopted at the annual meeting,
and can the member demand an investigation
of the societys books? —4l42.
Criticism of the items should have preceded
the adoption of the balance sheet. A member
cannot demand an investigation of the society’s
books, but he can propose and move a reso-
lution to that effect, giving his reasons for doing
so. The result would depend on the fate of
the resolution.
(1 ) What was the origin of the America’s
'z U P; What were the circumstances of
Lord Dunraven’s protest ? —3923.
• Ti ?e schooner-rigged America visited England
in 1851 and, being subject to no handicap
restrictions, _ carried all before it in competition
with English yachts. The America’s Cup was
made as a memorial of its victory, and .a
general invitation issued to challengers, a con-
dition being that yachts from other nations
must sail to the U.S.A., as the America did
to England. (2) After Lord Dunraven’s Val-
kyrie II had won a heat the N.Y.Y. Club per-
mitted the defender to make alterations. Lord
Dunraven protested unavailingly, and in the
next heat Valkyrie II came out with cruiser
sails set, and did not stop until it reached
England. Lord Dunraven was; induced by
royal influence to apologise to the angry
Americans.

club: played one newly-formed in .Wanganui
for “£5 a bat.”
A man of 86 appeared as a party in, a N.S.W.

cree was given to the 66-year-old wife of a
man' aged 94; his Australian wife discovered
that he had a wife in Germany. ,
How to find due north with a watch 3—3912.
This can only be done when the sun is
shining, the watch being used - as a sundial.
Allow the shadow of a knife-blade to fall on
the face of the watch (which is held hori-
zontally) so that it cuts through the. centre
of the XII and the VI, the'Xll being nearest
the sun. Half-way between the hour hand
and the XII is due north in the Southern Hemi-
sphere.
In what circumstances did Australia take
possession of Nauru Island 3 —3928.
Alter German New Guinea had been occu-
pied and the Emden destroyed, a warship was
dispatched to the island, where the Germans
had a wireless station. The German Governor
surrendered, and, after the German residents
had undertaken to submit to Australian control,
the warship left. Later, the Australian flag
was hauled down and burned and the Aus-
tralian residents, a small minority, were * made
prisoners and deported in a small cargo vessel
to Ocean Island, where they were marooned for
two months. This action led to the arrest
and internment of all the Germans and- occu-
pation by an Australian garrison. After the
war, the island was passed over to the United
Kingdom, Australia and Maoriland jointly,
under mandate. The first and second Adminis-
trators were appointed, by agreement, by the
Commonwealth Government.
(1) A recent Service Dept, reply related to
the New York “Hall of Fame.” Where can I
find more detailed information concerning it?
(2) Names that were first and last empanelled ?
(3) Is it a fact that Whitman’s name was only
empanelled after considerable agitation 3—4240.
(1) In “ ‘The World’ Almanac and Encyclo-
psedia,” published annually in New York. (2)
The first name was that of George Washington •
the last, Walt Whitman. (3) It took a crusade
extending over many years to get the name of
Whitman on one of the panels, so strong was
the feeling against his memory in many quar-
ters of the U.S.A. —on account of what is con-
sidered the obscenity of one of his poems.
(1) Who was the “Turkish Messiah,” and (2)
where can I find detailed information about
him 3—4233.
(1) Sabbatai Zevi, a Turkish Jew, born at
Smyrna, there declared himself the Messiah of
his,people in 1648. He recanted and became the
Sultan’s doorkeeper (2) His career is reviewed
at length in Israel Zangwiil’s “Dreamers of the
Ghetto.”
From what story was the book of the opera
“La Boheme” taken 3—4246.
• Henri Murger’s “Scenes de la Vie de
Boheme.” It has been translated into English
by Ellen Marriage and John Selwyn as “The
Latin Quarter.”
(1) When and where was Marconi born 3
(2) When did he first carry out experiments in
wireless 3 (3) Particulars of early apparatus 3
(4) When did he first bridge the Atlantic by
wireless signals, and what power was. used 3
3908.
, (1) At Bologna, Italy, on April 25, 1874.
(2) About Junej 1895, on his father’s estate at
Bologna. (3) The receiver used a T coherer, a
relay, a decoherer and a Morse printing instru-
ment, all working from ’accumulators. The
transmitter employed an induction coil, spark
gap, aerial and earth. (4) On December 12.
1901, he received signals in Newfoundland
from the Poldhu station in Cornwall, using
about 12kw.
How was the Spit Bridge, Sydney, financed?
—3926.
The N.S.W. Government was asked to build
the bridge, but declined. Manly Council then
obtained authority to raise a loan of £60,000
to build the bridge and to collect tolls to
repay the loan. It also spent £lO,OOO on the
enterprise out of revenue. The toll rapidly
extinguished the debt.
My rhododendrons are making poor growth.
What can be done for them ? Can l shift
them and grow them in tubs? —3918.
Soil is the chief factor. It should be loamy,
free from chalk or lime. Best position is in
the open on a lawn, where there are no
overshadowing trees. Fertilisers or strong
manures should not be used; rotted leaf-mould
is helpful. Water heavily in dry weather. If
tubs are used they should be at least 2ft. deep
to give the fibrous roots plenty of room to
spread. When these plants are grown in tubs,
flowers should be removed as soon as they
wither.
I bought hydrangea shrubs which had blue
flowers; the year after 1 placed them in the
ground the flowers were pink. How can I
recover the original color? —3915.
The alkaline nature of your soil was the
reason of the change of color. To bring back
the blue flowers, give the shrubs weekly doses
of a mixture of loz. of sulphate of iron in
lgal. of water _ throughout the summer.
Where the chemical is not procurable, old
nails soaked in water will have the same
effect.
How to grow lilies-of-the-valley ? What
special soil is needed ? Is there any sale for
them to Sydney florists ?— 3911.
Lily-of-the-valley crowns should be planted
in late autumn in prepared beds of sandy
loam well enriched with rotted manure and
leaf-mould. Set the crowns 6in. apart, barely
covering them with soil; a month later cover
them with leaves as protection against frost.
In spring clean the covering away and give
the crowns liberal helpings of weak liquid
manure. _Lilies-of-the-valley require a semi-
shaded position, and thrive well in a bush-house
or conservatory. Divide the crowns every year,
otherwise the roots become matted and the
bulbs will not flower. There should be a
ready market for the blooms, which are used
extensively in bouquets, etc.
Will it harm native shrubs such as Christmas-
bush, waratah and Geraldton wax to prune
them? When should it be done? —3913.
All three are improved by pruning. The
work should be done after the flowering is
over, since next year’s flowers are carried on
the new wood made. The Geraldton wax
especially can be trimmed to any shape to get
a better effect, since the blooms are carried
along the stems.
(1) What system is adopted for filling vacan-
cies in the Customs Department ? (2) To
whom should application be made ? (3) Age
limit ? (4) Qualifications ? —3974., '
(1). With the exception of junior clerks, all
positions are filled by permanent officers of
the Commonwealth Public Service. (2) The
Commonwealth Public Service Inspector in the
State where employment is desired. (3) For the
Fourth Division, 16 to 50 years. (In special
circumstances 55 years.) For the Third Divi-
sion, except in the case of returned soldiers,
the maximum age of candidature for admission
into the Third Division is 23 years at last
birthday on day of examination. (4) This in-
formation will be supplied on application to
the Commonwealth Public Service Inspector.
(1) What is meant by the term “case-harden-
ing” as applied to the heat treatment of steel ?
(2) How to case-harden steel nuts ? —3916.
(1) The process of hardening the surface of
the steel by adding carbon to it, leaving the
inside tough, is called “case-hardening.” (2)
Nowadays it is the practice to bring the
steel to a uniform bright-red heat, plunge
into finely-powdered yellow prussiate of potash,
repeating three or four times, and finally
plunging into cold water while still red-hot.
The threaded part should be filled up with
clay so that it does not come into contact
with the carbonising material. Older workshop
practice was to heat the steel in an iron case
packed with leather scraps, hence the trade
term.
(1) Chemical name for sal ammoniac ? (2)
Chemical composition ? (3) Does it occur in
a natural state ? (4) Principal uses ? —3914.
(1) Ammonium chloride. (2) Molecule con-
sists of an atom of nitrogen, four atoms of
hydrogen and an atom of chlorine. (3) It
occurs naturally in volcanic regions, but is
more generally obtained as a by-product of
gasworks. (4) It is used chiefly in many
forms of primary battery, particularly that
known as the Leclanche. It is also used in the
form of a paste in some dry cells.
How to make paste that will keep good ?
—4226.
Dissolve a teaspoonful of alum in a quart of
water. When cold stir in as much flour as will
make a thick cream, and be careful to break
up the lumps. Stir in as much powdered resin
as will lie on a sixpence, and add a little oil
of cloves to give a pleasant odor. Have on the
fire a saucepan with half a pint of boiling
water ; stir the flour mixture into this. In a
few minutes it will be about the consistency of
thick gruel. Pour it into an earthern or glass
vessel, lay a cover over it, and put in a cool
place. When needed for use take out a portion
and soften with warm water. Paste made this
way can be kept 12 months.
When charging several batteries of different
capacities, in series, should 'he charging rate
recommended for the large-capacity cells be
used ? —3920.
No, because this will cause the temperature
of the small cells to rise more rapidly than
that of the large cells and cause overheating.
If accumulators of different sizes must be
charged collectively, charge them at the rate
required for the smallest batteries, and when
the latter are charged remove them.

“Colonel Bungstarter”: Have we de-

According to English police reports, these
are people who lock up their children
all day while they go off roistering in
the ’bus. A couple at Epsom were fined
£l5 each, with costs, and bound over
for two years for leaving their son, aged
sjr, locked up in a room from 9.30 a.m.
till 10 p.m. with some water and a few
biscuits, while they were out on a jaunt.
Their defence was that the child suffered
from car sickness and that it would have
been cruel to take him along. N.S.P.C.C.
officials report that cases of the kind
occur frequently, and that remonstrances
to parents only elicit the reply that
modern authorities on <yjiild management
lay it down that children suffer no harm
from being left to themselves.

“Manso Cerda”: The bonfire festivals
of St. John’s Eve may be found in many
lands besides Cornwall and Peru (B.
17/10/’34). They were held in Spain in
my girlhood days some 40-odd years
ago. We lived in Cataluna, on the high
plateau at the foot of the Pyrenees;
every year on June 24 the whole table-
land was lit with fires, and around each
the peasants, joining hands, danced their
national dance, the Sardana. The cul-
mination came when the flames died
down, all who could manage it rushing
at the coals and leaping over them. I
was too young then to know the signi-
ficance of the festival, but it certainly
had no relation to the harvest, which
was in August. Doubtless the Conquis-
tadores took it to South America, but
it is harder to explain its occurrence in
Cornwall.
“Old Color”: Several writers have
been fulminating against the world-wide
custom of wearing “blazers” like Joseph’s
coat, with no particular meaning or dis-
tinction attaching to them. No one has
noted an atrocious fashion peculiar, I
think, to this country. In this case the
offenders are mostly members of the
G.P.S. and entitled to their cricket or
football colors. But it is now the custom
to plaster the original garment with
hideous badges denoting distinction in
sports other than that for which the
color was first granted. A Sydney
Grammar boy who first got his blazer
for rowing, say, plasters on a badge
when he gets to the first XV, another
when he wins to the XI, and so on.
Some of the star athletes are so covered
with these things that they look like
South American diplomatists at a royal
levee. I haven’t seen a youth with a
badge on his back yet, but that is sure
to come.
“General Prac”: A Swedish chemist
has devised means for determining the
amount of alcohol in a sample of blood,
and the Swedish Government has already
applied the test in all sorts of legal in-
quiries, including motor-smash trials.
The results are described as entirely satis-
factory—from the police standpoint, any-
way. It’s generally accepted that the
effect of liquor varies with the indi-
vidual ; but the Swedish scientist, one
Widmark, maintains that the average
man gives an average reaction to a given
amount of drink. Let your blood con-
tain eight parts of alcohol in 10,000, and
you stay cold sober; push up the figure
ever so little (10 in 10,000) and the birds
commence to sing. After that things
move quicker, the toper becoming talka-
tive, quarrelsome or benevolent, as the
case may be, until, at 26 parts per 10,000,
the best of us has gone to the wide.

Cabled that Ponzi, the New York
Italian who made a fortune a few years
back by an exchange racket, has been
released. The Governments of Italy and
U.S.A. at the outset were so slow that
they permitted the lira to be accepted in.
Italy and cabled to New York to be paid
at par value—that was at a time when
the lira was 100 or so to the pound ster-
ling. Ponzi simply sent the money back-
wards and forwards and raked off at least
50 per cent, profit each time. An Aus-
tralian theatrical man who went to Lon-
don via Cape Town in 1920 received £lO3
for £lOO which had been cabled to him
from Sydney. That £lO3, cabled to Lon-
don, remained £lO3 ; and in those days
the exchange between London and Aus-
tralia was negligible. He admitted that
he was sorely tempted to stay on in
Cape Town and revel in the riches he
could obtain by sending £lOO on a round
trip as often as the cables could function.

keep off the first-class deck when off duty.
Some commanders were more tolerant
than others, but I learned my lesson early

AMAZING PERFORMANCE OF AIRFLOW
CHRYSLER.
SPEED—ROADWORTHINESS—COMFORT AND ECONOMY.
BY FRED BERRY.
DURING the last few years stock-car speeds have increased
to such an extent that to-day any further improvement in
road performance when using conventional body styles can
only be obtained by fitting enormously powerful motors, with
consequent high operating costs in terms of fuel and tyres.
The Chrysler Airflow Eight has overcome these difficulties
by concentrating on body design, incorporating aerodynamic
principles, and at one stroke has produced the most-talked-of
car of the decade. In this car, economy is not affected by extra-
ordinary and almost unbelievable road speeds, while road-
worthiness and passenger comfort are for all practical purposes
ideal.
Wind-tunnel experiments have proved
the enormous advantages of efficient
streamlining, and, although several lead-
ihg manufacturers have with more or
less success attempted to build a car
along these lines, it remained for
Unconventional but highly efficient body of the Airflow Chrysler tested over
THE BULLETIN course.
Chrysler to take the bull by the horns,
cast convention to the winds and do
the job in a thorough manner.
There is, and always will be, a small
section of conservative motorists who
insist that the Airflow is ugly and so are
hostile to its acceptance, but the fact
remains that in this extraordinary car
Australian motorists can for the first
Airflow Chrysler frame integral with body of cross-braced
girder construction, assuring maximum strength and rigidity.
time realise what real motoring should
be.
One should take the Airflow over a
two- or three-hundred-mile trip in order
to secure a true perspective of its value,
as first impressions leave even experi-
enced drivers positively spellbound and
frankly dubious of the accuracy of the
speedometer. Tested recently over The
Bulletin course, this remarkable
machine proved to the hilt every claim
set out in its favor,
With generous room for six passen-
gers, once the car is under way accelera-
tion in any gear and at any speed is tre-
mendous, but as a set-off the braking-
equipment is equally efficient. With re-
gard to touring speed it would not be
politic to mention this feature in terms
of miles per hour, but one can with
safety assess it at from 50 to 1.00 per
cent, above that of conventional cars.
To derive full advantage from the
Airflow Chrysler
one must have
had a thorough
grounding in
high-speed driv-
ing, for after a
full-throttle run
on the open road
one feels on slow-
ing down to 70
m.p.h. that the
car is only pot-
tering along, so
smooth, steady
and silent is its
progress. On the other hand, those
drivers who desire only greatest comfort,
coupled with perfect roadworthiness and
good acceleration, will find that this car
can amble along in top gear at less than
three miles per hour, and is as docile
at low speeds as any conventional type.
Although it has been the custom on
this page to first describe the engine when
dealing with cars under test, on this
occasion the body framework, due to its
extremely novel construction, will first
receive attention. In conventional types
the chassis is designed either with cross-
members or, in more modern styles, on
the X-girder principle, the latter many
times stronger than
the former. The Air-
flow Chrysler, how-
ever, goes further, for
the chassis is integral
with the body, as
shown in the accom-
panying illustration,
and it is claimed to
be 40 times more
rigid than the conven-
tional car. Further-
more, in no conceiv-
ab 1 e circumstances
could an accident
crush the body suffi-
ciently to injure pas-
sengers. The imported
body is splendidly fin-
ished and equipped,
no-draught ventilation
being provided in front and rear
windows, while the rear-seat squab is
hinged, giving access to a huge rear
luggage, compartment.
The front of the car is broad and car-
ried down in a sweeping curve, head-
lights being built into the body. Radi-
ator is positioned well behind a false
plated grill which conforms in line with
the body. Duplex horns, also beneath
the bonnet, are on each side of the
radiator. This arrangement could be
improved on, as at speed the warning
notes, although of generous volume,
appear to be blown back into the car
instead of being projected ahead.
For purposes of adjustment and engine
overhaul, the curved top of the housing
lifts from the front and is hinged for-
ward of the windscreen (see sketch). In
case of valve overhaul, one of the front
wheels is removed and a metal plate,
held in position by six bolts, gives ready
access to the motor.
The 8-cyl. engine of L-head design,
with 3|in. bore and 4|in. stroke and a
piston displacement of 298.6 cubic inches,
has an R.A.C. rating of 33.8 h.p. Maxi-
mum brake-horsepower is, however, 122
at 3400 r.p.m. Compression ratio is
6.5 to 1, and a specially designed alu-
minium cylinder head is used in order
to increase turbulence of gases and pre-
vent pinking.
Pistons are T-slot, of aluminium alloy,
with four rings per piston—three corn-

pression and one oil ring. Inlet and ex-
haust valves are side by side, while
exhaust-valve seatings of hardened steel
are inset in the cylinder block, ensuring
good compression over long periods and
freedom from valve overhaul.
The crankshaft is balanced static-
ally and dynamically, and is of generous
diameter. It runs in five main bearings,
and an impulse neutraliser, absorbing
tortional vibration, is located on the
front end of the shaft.
Ignition is by coil and battery, with
full automatic advance and retard, and
coincidental starting equipment actuated
by depression of the accelerator pedal is
fitted.
Fuel is taken from a 16gal. tank
located at the rear and fed to a duplex-
type down-draught carburettor by a
mechanical pump driven by an eccentric
from the camshaft. A large air-cleaner
and silencer is attached to the carburet-
tor intake. The conventional choke
button is eliminated, an automatic choke
control interconnected with the throttle
giving a perfect start every time the
accelerator pedal is depressed, regardless
of temperature. In addition a thermo-
stat, built into the carburettor control,

under all con-
diti o n s of

The engine
is suspended
on live rubber
supports by the
patented
Chrysler float-
ing - power
mounting, whereby all torque vibra-
tion is eliminated. Transmission is
through a single-plate clutch to the
three-speed-and-reverse gearbox, fitted
with constant-mesh silent gears. In addi-
tion, a free-wheeling unit is built integral
with the gearbox, together with an ex-
tremely useful and highly efficient “over-
drive” mechanism.
Although motorists are already
familiar with free-wheeling equipment,
the overdrive gear is worthy of particu-
lar mention. Driving in conventional
gear the back-axle ratio is 4.1 to 1,
but immediately the speedometer passes
the 40 mark lifting the foot momentarily
from the accelerator pedal brings the
overdrive into operation, increasing the
effective ratio by 30 p.c. to approxi-
mately 2.87 to 1, with consequent re-
duction of engine revs, and greatly im-
proved fuel consumption. Overdrive can
be thrown out of operation at will by
operating a selector button on the dash-
board.
Final drive is through open propeller
shaft equipped with roller universal
joints fore and aft to a banjo-type rear
housing. Axles in the final drive are
fitted with dual-tapered roller bearings.

PONTIAC is stealing the laurels
of the most expensive cars . . .
Owners of the most luxurious and expensive
cars have found, after they have ridden in and
driven the Pontiac Straight Eight, that Pontiac
is so advanced in every detail of design, so
refreshing in its performce, and so consoling
in its deep comfort, that their change was
decidedly for the better.
Here are some of the features that make a
Pontiac demonstration a memorable ex-
perience. A smooth, flexible motor gives you
straight-eight power with the economy of
many sixes—knee-action front wheels make
every road a boulevard —a ride stabiliser ends
side-sway when cornering Bendix cable
brakes make any speed positively safe —an
easy steering wheel that you can turn with a
finger harmoniously streamlined bodies
no-draught ventilation. Of still more import-
ance are some features you do not see, as for
instance: metered-flow lubrication which adds
thousands of miles to engine life —vacuumatic
spark control, giving amazing economy and
brilliant performance—new K.Y. type frame of exceptional
strength and rigidity—Octane Selector, enabling best per-
formance from any grade of fuel.
If these are the main essentials you feel your next car must
have then your next car should be Pontiac. Your
local dealer will give you full specifications and prices, and
arrange for a demonstration ride. Three models —Roadster,
Coupe, and Sedan.

The airflow sedan tested over The
Bulletin course was driven by Otto
James, of York Motors, Ltd., N.S.W.
distributors, speedometer reading being
7118 miles and weight, including driver
and observer, 394 cwt.
A test of the braking equipment
showed that the car could be stopped in
23ft. from 25 m.p.h., while, although the
wheelbase is 123 in., the turning circle,
24ft. on right lock and 38ft. on left lock,
indicated excellent manoeuvrability.
Driving through the busy streets the
Airflow showed great handiness in traffic,
and once on the open road outside the
city limits one could scarcely believe
the speedometer was correct, so silently
and smoothly did the car move.
Before reaching Windsor the rolling
test' was conducted, and the Airflow* be-
ginning at 15 m.p.h., coasted 744 yards
before coming to rest, proving absolute
truth and freedom of all wheel bearings
and transmission details.
Next test was to determine maximum
speed, and for this purpose the pilot
made several runs in conventional top
and overdrive. In conventional gear
the mile was covered in 42 seconds, an
average of 85.7 m.p.h., while in overdrive
the clock showed 40 4-5 seconds, equal
to 88.2 m.p.h.. During these tests the
car held the road splendidly, while the
engine was so quiet that conversation
could be carried on in a normal manner.
Through Richmond and taking the
narrow dirt-road route through Grose
Vale the car behaved admirably. The
speed climb of Kurrajong Mountain,
2 1-3 miles, was next made from a
standing start, and here the Airflow
gave a true account of its magnificent
road-holding qualities by making the
climb with power to spare and without
the semblance of risk in 2min. 59 2-ssec.
—the fastest time in this series of tests.
Returning down the mountain the
cross-country route via Castlereagh to
Penrith was taken, and here further per-
formance tests were conducted. First
test involved covering 350 yards in top
gear as slowly as possible, followed im-
mediately by a similar distance “accele-
rated,” still in top, and here the Airflow
showed its wonderful flexibility. The
slow-running section was clocked in
4min. lsec., averaging 3.01 m.p.h., while
the accelerated section was timed in
15 4-ssec., averaging 45.5 m.p.h., and
crossing the finishing line at 65 m.p.h.
Acceleration from 10 to 30 m.p.h. in
top gear and second gear was then tested,
times taken being 7 2-ssec. and ssec.
respectively. From a standing start to
50 m.p.h., however, revealed better the
possibilities of this remarkable car, the
elapsed time being lOsec.
The time, inclusive of all tests, for the
journey of 124 miles was 2hr. 45min.,
averaging 45.1 m.p.h., and the petrol used,
7 gallons pints, showed a consump-
tion of 16.4 m.p.g.—a performance
due in a great measure to airflow body
design and overdrive transmission.

“Buck”: Nowadays if the engine stalls
when fording a stream it is usually pos-
sible to pull out on the self-starter. In
the days before the self-starter a re-

crossing on the Murchison River with
his crank handle. Spark plugs were
removed to relieve compression, and his
clothing for comfort. Then with gear
in mesh he laboriously wound his way
across.

5 Miles 500 Miles
.... thousands of miles!
It is the usual Chevrolet story. First, they came to
try the famous five mile ride and stayed to buy.
They’ve done well over 500 now and are starting to
enthuse all over again.
They’re planning long tours off the beaten path
this Spring. Well, they can go as far and fast as they
like, for Knee-action makes all roads feel smooth.
That silent valve-in-head engine has power enough
to climb mountains, sweep through mud and sand in
top, or reach 80 m.p.h. with the feel of an easy 50.
Bigger brakes mean a stand still at a touch. Vibration-
free steering and Synchro-mesh gears cut driving
strain. No-draught ventilation gives everyone just
the right amount of fresh air. And who cares if
petrol pumps are few and far between—the 1934
Chevrolet gives 15% greater petrol economy. Those
are only the highlights of Master Chevrolet perfor-
mance. The Standard model, too, has an impressive list
of features which make it a grand Gar to drive and own.
For you, as for these happy people, Chevrolet will
be an investment you’ll be glad of for thousands and
thousands of miles. Seethe nearest dealer and arrange
for your five mile drive and the family’s five mile ride.

O
FACTS!
The only type of
circulation that
has real worth is that which is constant ami
embodies the confidence of readers. These
attributes are possessed only by the daily
newspapers whose circulations are derived, not
by contests, insurance schemes, or high pres-
sure methods, but by real merit. They are
bought because people want them in their
homes.
The daily newspaper
is so essential
to the New Zealander that even in times of
economic stress he continues to buy hss
morning daily, so valuable is it for the
information it gives, both in its news and
advertisement columns.
Newspaper advertising, is the most economical,
effective and forcible medium for reaching
the New Zealand public.

paraffin should be used to dissolve the coating
of oil. Also examine the radiator-hose connec-
tions and fan belt, and check ignition timing
and valve clearances.
J.C. (Bowelling, W.A.). —Is there any gear
that starts from bottom and changes up auto-
matically and when a hill is encountered
changes down again ?
Constantinesco and De Lavaud variable trans-
missions both dispense with the conventional
gearbox, engine revs, being governed by load.
Neither of these transmissions is used on
cars on the Australian market, nearest approach
being the fluid flywheel on the Armstrong-
Siddeley, Daimler, etc.
D.G.C. (Walleundrie, N.S.W.). —(1) The
Zenith carburettor on my 16 -h.p. Austin floods
badly. What will cure this ? (2) The hose
connection from the radiator to the engine
leaks where joined to the engine. Have tried
packing with grease, but it was not satisfac-
tory. What is the matter ?
(1) Probably the needle valve is badly worn,
forming a shoulder on the tapered end of the
needle. Turn off this shoulder and grind
into seating, or, to be quite sure, fit new
needle valve complete. (2) Either the hoseclip
is of the wrong type and seating badly, or the
hose connection is too short, and twisting of
chassis and engine vibration is pulling the
motor end from its seating. If the outlet pipe
is free from rust, hose of sufficient length
and clip of correct design the connection can-
not leak.
M.F. (W. Wyalong, N.S.W.). —The oil gauge
on my 1926 Pontiac does not appear to func-
tion properly; full pressure when motor is
cold and slb. to 10 lb. when hot, unless revved
up, when it is very erratic. Car has done only
1000 miles since a rebore. Remedy ? Where
can I get an instruction book for this car ?
Indications are that one of the crankshaft
bearings is very slack. If all bearings were
worn equally oil pressure would be low but
constant at any speed. Write Larke, Neave and
Carter, Ltd., William-street, Sydney, for in-
struction book.
J.W.G. (Gordon, N.S.W.). —7 have just
bought a Model T Ford that was wired for
battery ignition only. I ran a wire direct from
the collector plug to the coils, taking the bat-
tery wire off, but can’t get the engine to run.
Can this be adjusted ?
This is common to old models of this type.
Bobbins lose their magnetism through collec-
tion of particles of metal, and, due to wear
of bearings, magnets fall out of adjustment
with plate, and if too close damage the insula-
tion of the bobbins. Continue with the battery
system, and fit a generator to avoid constant
charging.
Cocky (Wirrega, S.A.). —I bought a gallon
tin of Oildag, but it was only sufficient for
40 gallons of oil for my tractor. Can l pur-
chase Oildag in bulk ?

in this manner. All you require is one ounce

to each gallon of lubricating oil, and after
using half a dozen fills of the crankcase it will
have given the cylinders and bearings the
necessary coating. Further use is only throw-
ing money away.
CJ.McL. (Waipukurau, M.L.). —Could I fit
air wheels to a 1930 Studebaker Dictator, and
how would the change affect the running of the
car as regards petrol consumption, tyre mileage,
road-holding, steering and braking ?
You would require new rims to accomodate
the larger section covers, and tyre manufac-
turers will inform you whether king-pin angle
and so road-holding and steering will be affected
by the change on your particular road. Petrol
consumption should not vary so long as tyre
diameter remains the same, while brake effici-
ency should undoubtedly be increased. Equip-
ment should stand up to 20,000 miles normal
driving so long as recommended pressures are
adhered to.
G.B. (Benalla, Vic). —Within what distance
should a 1934 car equipped with correctly-
adjusted four-wheel breaks stop ?
The theoretical ideal stop would be 30ft.
from 30 m.p.h. Occasionally in practice this
distance is bettered, but a satisfactory stopping
on average road surfaces would be 35ft. at
30 m.p.h.
E.M.W. (Warren, N.S.W.).— After wet
weather my brakes squeak terribly. Is there
any simple remedy ?
The fabric linings of the brake-shoes have
probably worn to a shiny, hard surface. Try
a few drops of half-and-half mixture of lubri-
cating oil and kerosene squirted into the brake-
drum, keeping the wheel rotating meanwhile.
If this fails a reline will be necessary. In
some older-type cars equipped with thin steel
brake-drums squeaking can be stopped by fit-
ting an adjustable band on the outside of the
housing.
Motor Oddities.
When motorists foregather the topics of conversation seldom centre in
technical or abstract features, but rather in personal experiences or
achievements.
Arguments wax hot where petrol consumption or speeds over specified
routes are concerned, and the cost of maintenance and the present mechanical
condition of cars after years of use are matters of extreme interest. Huge
annual mileages, old driving licenses, and perhaps low car numbers support
claims to experience, while many drivers, with characteristic Australian
ingenuity, have made interesting emergency repairs.
Who has driven more than 500,000 miles, and which driver covers the
greatest distance each year?
Thrills and extraordinary driving experiences have not been confined to
racing drivers, while outback the bush mechanic, hundreds of miles from
repair shops, has worked miracles in order to get the car home.
Motorists are invited to write to “The Bulletin” and recount their
experiences.

WHAT THE OTHER MAN IS DOING.
BY DON B. KNOCK.
Most of our radio development in Australia follows on that of America,
England or Germany. This is no reflection on the ability of Australian
technical radio men to produce new ideas or designs, but it is due to the
fact that only in those countries are there big laboratories with their exten-
sive resources. No sooner is some new line of thought available to the
technicians of the Northern Hemisphere than the idea is seized upon and
tried. If worth while, it is given practical application, and another
development is added to the constantly increasing number. Overseas
publications tell the story in due course, but not all people interested in
radio in Australia are readers of these publications. Outlined here are
a few of the more recent highlights in radio development in other countries.
Not so long ago the all-wave receiver
was considered by many manufacturers
to be just' a makeshift kind of affair
with which one could, as a secondary
consideration, move a switch mechan-
ism, and in an indifferent manner in-
dulge in a little searching over the short-
wave channels used for long-distance
broadcasting. At this period the few
stations on the air with short-wave pro-
grammes were very much in the experi-
Fig. 1. —The calibrated dial fitted to
Stromberg-Carlson ( U.S.A.) all-wave
models.
(From “Electronics.”)
mental stage. There was quite a lot of
work yet to be done in transmitter de-
sign, not to mention radiating systems,
and, although programmes were heard
quite well on occasions, they fell far
short of expectations. Profuse advertis-
ing, in U.S.A. particularly, stressed the
delights of the all-wave receiver, and the
public began to buy. One strong sell-
ing point seemed to be ability to listen
to police broadcasts, and advertising
copy-writers penned exciting screeds
about radio rounding up crooks, and
how all this sort of thing could be heard
at home.
Two manufacturers of repute had,
from an early date, foreseen the popu-
larity of overseas short-wave listening,
and had produced in their well-equipped
laboratories all-wave superheterodyne
models which were really fine receivers
-—veritable Rolls-Royces of radio. One
of these manufacturers even brought one
of his receivers to Australia, and demon-
strated that his claims for good overseas

programme-selecting device.
(From “Electronics.”)
reception “every day and all the year”
were no idle boast. In addition to these
outstanding all-wavers, the radio market
in U.S.A. bristled for a while with all
kinds of all-wave models, good, indif-
ferent' and bad. Three years have gone
by, and it is a different story. The more
important world short-wave transmitters
have been vastly improved, and receivers
are in step. To-day, the better-known
American all-wave receivers are excel-
lent pieces of radio apparatus. Switch-
ing troubles have disappeared, newer
valves are put to good use, and the
public is much more interested and satis-
fied. This progress is reflected in a few
Australian all-wave models, and to-day
there seems to be little object in buying
a receiver which does not cover every-
thing from around 12 metres to 600.
These local products are definitely very
good, and in one instance at least even
better, in the writer’s opinion, on the
shorter-wave ranges than most overseas
productions.
Tuning Dials.
The U.S.A. set the fashion in the air-
plane-type dial. Receivers began to take
on a more attractive appearance, and in
the case of the dial calibrated over all
ranges tuning on short waves became an
easy process instead of a hit-or-miss busi-
ness. A fine example of a calibrated all-
wave dial is shown in Figure 1. This is
fitted on the Stromberg-Carlson (U.S.A.)
receivers. In addition to indicating the
precise coverage of every tuning range
in frequency, this carries instructions on
the left-hand side for the complete opera-
tion of the receiver. Thus everything
the user needs to know is right before
the eyes, which is as it should be. A
different departure in dials is that intro-
duced by Atwater-Kent, illustrated in
Figure 2. In this device an electric
clock plays an important part. Dif-
ferent programmes can be pre-selected
over a 12-hour period, and the listener
uses a sort of miniature plug-and-cord
telephone exchange. The device then
carries on automatically, shifting from
one station to another as pre-determined.
Although this may seem rather a luxu-
rious refinement, it is really a great asset,
Fig. 3. —The R.C.A. Radiotron “acorn”
valve for micro-ray work, applicable for
waves as short as 40 centimetres.
(From “Electronics.”)
as there must be many radio listeners
who miss some wanted feature simply
because the time has been overlooked.
The idea is worthy of application to Aus-
tralian-made receivers.
The High-fidelity Business.
It would seem, if some overseas adver-
tisements are to be heeded, that most
modern receivers are totally inadequate
and just noise producers. If this is to
be accepted, one feels that the public
everywhere has been sadly deluded for
many years. One writer in U.S.A. com-
mented sarcastically that, “if advertisers
are to be believed, the Lord did a very
poor job with the human ear.” The
trouble is that the frequency response of
the human ear varies widely. That is
well known. The receiver of to-day with
a reasonably good measure of audio
response may be fully satisfying to a lis-
tener, and to the same listener a receiver
designed under what may be termed a
high-fidelity standard may be unimpres-
sive, or vice versa. As an example, the
writer was impressed by a demonstration
of wide-range recording at a Sydney
broadcasting studio, yet other people
present commented upon a certain metal-
lic emphasis on some frequencies which
was practically unnoticed by the writer’s
ears. It will be difficult to satisfy the re-
quirements of the public’s ears as a
whole with receivers of the high-fidelity
kind, and one feels that to do the thing
properly the receiver will have to be
made to the measure of the individual.
Even so, anything in the nature of a
step forward in attaining faithful repro-
duction of an original sound is com-
mendable, and because radio engineers
are thinking along these lines the audio
side of radio reception will inevitably
improve. To this end, the foundation
must be laid with the transmission first,
and this is now being done in Australia.
Ultra-high Frequencies.
With television engineers making use
in a very practical manner of 5-met're
waves, and with centimetre waves in
commercial use for various purposes, it
has been necessary for the valve labora-
tories to produce vacuum tubes that will
serve as oscillators and amplifiers for
very high frequencies. R.C.A. Radio-
tron Co., Inc., U.S.A., has turned out
very small valves for such work and
Fig. 4. —The principle of the visual
tuning indicator using a small lamp.
(From “Wireless World.”)
dubbed them “acorn” tubes. These will
amplify, oscillate and detect on waves as
short as 40 centimetres. Fig. 3 shows
such a valve, and it is interesting to note
that its actual size is about that of a
sixpenny-piece. Much more will be
heard of micro-ray work in the future,
and, although the application is limited
in a sense of “distance” communication,
the very high frequencies have very
definite commercial value.
New Visual Tuning Indicator.
From England details are to hand of
a different kind of visual tuning device
in which the dimness or brightness of a
lamp shows when the tuning is correct.
The idea is simple but ingenious, and is
illustrated in the diagram of Fig. 4. The
lamp is heated from the supply to the
valve heaters through a resistance R, and
the secondary of a transformer T is con-
nected in parallel. The primary of the
transformer is connected in the plate cir-
cuit of one of the valves with automatic
volume control.
The current flowing through the lamp
controls the brilliancy, and it will be
seen that if the secondary impedance is
increased more current will flow, and
the lamp will glow brighter. As the
heater supply is coupled to the plate cir-
cuit via the transformer, the precaution
of a filter choke and capacity is taken
to prevent the introduction of A.C. hum
in the plate circuit.
A Two-in-One Loudspeaker.
A radically different kind of loud-
speaker has made its appearance in Eng-
land, the idea being novel. This is illus-

trat'ed in Fig. 5. A 9in. cone with per-
manent magnet is mounted in such a
way that an extension chassis may be
bolted to it. The extension has a ring
magnet which operates a high-impedance
coil attached to a sin. or 7in. cone, with
the common output transformer con-
nected to serve as a choke for this second
speaker. It is supplied with one magnet
permanent and one energised, or with

esting point about loudspeakers in Eng-
land is that several makes are obtainable
with a variable ratio output transformer.

manufacturer) has no trouble in using the
speaker with the standard types of out-
put valves. This idea could well be
applied in speaker manufacture in Aus-
tralia.
Iron-cored Coils.
After a period of quiescence, the iron-
dust-cored coil is well in favor in Eng-
land and Germany. Unscrupulous small
manufacturers for a while flooded the
markets with inefficient types of these
coils, with the result that the popularity
of the genuine article waned. Exhaustive
tests with the correctly-designed article
show that there is every advantage to
be gained by their use, and, in addition
to the usual coil kits of this type, the
permeability tuner, in which tuning is
done by the movable cores of the coils,
is rapidly finding favor. As evidence of
the efficiency of iron-dust-cores, it' is
interesting to note that prominent Ameri-
can radio designers are now using them,
even for I.F. transformers in super-
heterodynes. In Australia we are still
hoping!
Television.
This much-abused infant seems to be
m the growing-pains stage, and at a recent
radio exhibition in Berlin the main fea-
ture was the section devoted to tele-
vision. Six different concerns showed
receivers, and there were continuous
demonstrations. The German Post Office
is collaborating closely with several of
the firms concerned, and the cathode-ray
tube with a screen a foot square will be
standardised for home receivers. At
Radiolympia in London television was
also very much in evidence, and an indi-
cation of what' a television receiver in its
modern form looks like is given in Fig.
6 This type of receiver was on show,
and in order to give the public an idea
of what may be expected of ultra-short-
wave television the screen aperture in-
cluded an untouched photograph of a
180-line image as received by this
method. The detail was good and
aroused interest. Television in however
an embryo stage should attract' attention ;
the time should not be far distant when
experimental transmissions of ultra-short-
wave television will be in. the air over
Australian cities. Such steps must be
taken if those responsible for radio and
its allied sciences wish Australia to keep
pace with radio progress.
D. B. K.
ANARCHY IN MUSIC.
On a recent Sunday evening sounds
never’heard before impinged upon the
ether over the eastern part of the Aus-
tralian continent. In ten thousand quiet
homes musically-minded folk listened,
first with keen interest, then with deep
perplexity, finally with horror or dis-
gust, according to temperament. One
of the best-equipped pianists—digitally
and mentally—of the day had preluded
the production of these sounds from an
ordinary concert grand by remarking that
he thought them very beautiful, that their
author is one of the pathfinders of music,
and that after a composer has listened
to these sounds for the first time his own
next composition shows that he has been
powerfully influenced.
Thus Percy Grainger in reference to
the pianoforte works of Arnold Schoen-
berg. The examples given were the six
short pianoforte pieces, Op. 19. Most
of the listeners, it may be surmised, corn-
mented, inwardly or audibly, “Well, it
sounds pretty awful to me, but if Grain-
ger fikes it there must be something in
it.” There is, but the deepest respect
and the warmest admiration for Mr.
Grainger won’t suffice to convince an
honest man or woman that it is music.
Schoenberg is an anarchist in harmony.
Etymologically, of course, an anarchist
is a person who doesn’t want to have
any laws at all; but in all the treatises
on political anarchy this commentator
has read it appears that, having scrapped
all existing laws, it becomes necessary to
make at least one new one —that no
more laws shall be made. Schoenberg
isn’t as drastic as that. He scraps most
of the old mathematical laws governing
the making of music, but replaces them
with the musical mathematics known as
dodecaphony—a system originated by a
German gentleman named Hauer, who
takes the 12 tones of the tempered chro-
matic scale and arranges them in 44
tropes with much geometrical neatness
and an utter disregard of how they
sound. Herr Hauer, after this exhaust-
ing achievement, went back to more con-
ventional methods of composition. Herr
Schoenberg’s revolutionary soul found
here at once a means of expressing his
detestation of Western harmonic canons
and of indulging a mathematical bent of
mind. The essence of dodecaphony is
that there is no keynote, no tonic, no
starting point. Exploration on these
lines is bound to produce new effects.
Schoenberg’s orchestral compositions
especially are full of interest for the pro-
fessor of theory. But it is impossible
to believe that the feeling that inspired
these ordered perversities had any
warmth in it.
Suppose we say that the old rules,
which were found in the main accept-

able to the greatest composers—-though
they didn’t scruple to make exceptions
.and innovations —are entirely arbitrary
in origin (they aren’t, but let that pass),
and that it is only because we are in-
ured to these conventions that we con-
ceive them to be the best basis of music.
Can’t we make another system, more
mathematically logical, more in keeping
with such modern conceptions as rela-
tivism and amoralism? Of course we
can, but we are still chained to the tem-
pered scale, which is a series of con-
venient compromises with mathematical
exactness, and our new system must be
built on those compromises unbacked by
the wealth of experience that has made
them tolerable. By the time we have
made our new system tolerable it, too,
will be swaddled tight in rules and regu-
lations.
It may be true that no music is music
to the listener unacquainted with its con-
ventions, but that’s no reason for set-
ting deliberately to work to make new
conventions. Quite conceivably there
may arise to-morrow a musical genius
who, for the expression of his inspira-
tion, will find accepted modes so far in-
adequate that he must make new ones
as he goes along. But he will have some-
thing so tremendously well worth saying
in his new idiom that all the world at last
will have to catch up with him. Even
Grainger doesn’t claim that Schoenberg
has something important to say.
Country Short-wave Explorations.
The 25 and 31 metre stations have
continued excellent at night, with a slight
improvement of both FYA and GSD
about 7 a.m. The 19-metre band has
been very patchy, with some nights ex-
cellent after 10.30, but on others poor
until much later.
The simultaneous transmission of PHI
turns out to be an old friend in the shape
of PCJ, but on a new wave-length an-
nounced as 19.71. metres. So far the
strength is much below PHI, but it will
probably improve later in the summer.
Nothing was heard of 2RO lately,
but what appears to be another Russian
station on 25.1 metres has been heard
at excellent strength after 6 on several
mornings. Interspersed with the music
is the typical alternate talk of a man and
woman announcer, but the programme
is different to that of RFN (49.9 m.).
The Americans in the 31-metre band
are improving in the mornings, and
are quite good strength from 6 to 7,
with W2XAF easily the best. On a
recent Sunday most of them were giving
the usual description of baseball matches.
RNE 25-metre transmission at 9 p.m.
Sunday is still only fair, but the midnight
transmission is excellent. There was a
very long period of questions and answers
at this time, but they faded out before
they were finished. Usually RNE goes
over to Russian talk sharp at 1 a.m.
Static has been too bad to spend much
time above 31 metres, but the Japanese
on 44 metres was so strong as to override
most of the static. There was no oppor-
tunity to try the 8.8. C. stations until
after 6.30 p.m., but at that hour GSB
was still the best. The news session at
7 p.m. drops to fair ’phone strength, but
is easily copied.
NIGHTOW.
Why Iron-cored Coils Are Worth
While.
To make an air-cored coil with such
efficient characteristics that resultant
selectivity in a tuned circuit is enough
to separate adjacent stations is quite easy,
although it may be inconvenient. The
main requirement is not selectivity alone ;
audio quality comes very much into the
picture as well. If a coil is designed
in such a way that it has a very sharp cut-
off, then reproduction quality is sure to
suffer. Hence the reason for the modern
iron-dust core coil referred to as Ferro-
cart and introduced in England by Messrs.
Colvern, Ltd. With correctly-designed
iron-cored coils ample selectivity is to
hand without loss of audio quality and,
most important of all, without loss of
efficiency. At present some Australian
radio manufacturers are putting their
advertising-copy writers to work extol-
ling the virtues of new and more effici-
ent coils now in the laboratory stage,
but there is no evidence that anything in
the nature of iron cores is on the way.
Casual Comment.
V ale-, Poldhu! The old pioneer radio-
telegraphy station on the Cornish coast
is closed down, and is to be dis-
mantled. It was here that 32 years ago
Signor Marconi, then an obscure young
man, transmitted his famous three-dot
signals across the Atlantic. A long-
distance ship-to-shore service was in
operation from Poldhu for many years,
and an achievement of the amateur of
1912-13 was to log Poldhu’s signals. With
the advent of war in 1914, Poldhu be-
came a press station for shipping. Writer
recalls the importance of tests in 1919
between Poldhu and the s.s. Victorian,
en route from Liverpool to Montreal.
This was the first serious attempt at tele-
phonic communication, and news items
and concerts were transmitted. A galena
crystal, loose-coupler and C MKIII
trench amplifier with massive horn at-
tached to a single earpiece made quite
a noise in a Lancashire town on these
transmissions. The Poldhu-Victorian
tests were followed by the experimental
station 2MT Writtle, with P. Eckersley
at the microphone. Later the British
Broadcasting Co. put in its appearance
with the old 2LO transmitter on Mar-
coni House, but the birth of broadcast-
ing in England really dates from the tests
between Poldhu and s.s. Victorian.

Objection has been raised in Sydney
Municipal Council to the erection by
A.W.A. of a 270 ft. mast, intended to
hold the radiating system for micro-ray
experiments. The reason for the objec-
tion is not clear, but if the State Block
in Market-street can flourish a towering
beacon affair intended to assist night-fly-
ing aviators, who are rare over Sydney,
there should be no very serious objec-
tion to a siriiilar structure erected in the
interests of scientific progress. If tele-
vision, for which ultra-short waves are
decidedly useful, is to be attempted in
Australia, radiating systems at a high
elevation will have to be used.

An Australian manufacturer of loud-

to experimenters or direct to the

MORE THAN JIfST MAKING VALVES
During the past ten years of radio, more
Milliard Valves have been sold than any other
make. This definitely proves two things:
that Milliard Master Valves must be the
finest radio valves obtainable, and that ten
years’ preference by the radio public has
been maintained by continued research and
experimenting. Write for Booklet.

broken-hearted. Experimental or home-
constructional business seems to be
anathema with some manufacturers, and
everything is done by them to discourage
the experimenter. A short decade ago
they were only too glad to have such
support.

Apart from the great utility of radio
to the listening public during the great
air race to Australia, it played a most
important part in putting Col. Roscoe
Turner (U.S.A.) in his big Boeing ’plane
on the right track near Allahabad. Tur-
ner was hunting around in the dark, and
took his direction instructions solely by
radio from the R.A.F. ground station.
The unlucky Mollisons frankly admitted
that not having radio on board their D.H.
Comet was a big handicap. When the
time comes for the establishment of a
really high-speed air-mail service between
England and Australia radio will be a
vitally important safety factor.

Radio manufacturers are turning their
attention to refrigerators, dish-washers
and other electrical apparatus for the
home. This is all very well, but it is to
be hoped that attention will be paid to
the fitting of these appliances with anti-
interference filters. Otherwise broadcast
receivers, which are already struggling
against a surfeit of man-made static, will
have much more to contend with. It is
high time that the sale of electrical
apparatus not equipped with filters was
made illegal. All-wave receivers in parti-
cular suffer badly from interference on
the short-wave side. It should be remem-
bered that the more stations the listener
can hear, the better for the radio trade
generally, with all due respect to the
much talked-of high-fidelity receiver.

In U.S.A., the veritable home of ama-
teur radio, all is not beer and skittles.
There are evidently those who take ad-
vantage of the apathy of others. A very
prominent radio man writes: “Really
the Hams have only themselves to blame
for their systematic loss of rights and
frequencies. They have always been just
too lazy-minded to act or even think
for themselves. ‘Let George do it’ has
been their slogan. That was pie for.
George. There was a lot in Ham radio
for him if the Hams would let him
handle their affairs in his way. There
was, and they did, and he did ; and he
has made a swell pile of cold cash out
of it for George!” There are 40,000
licensed transmitting amateurs in U.S.A.
alone, and the number is increasing daily.

“R.F.”: Made an important discovery
by accident recently, and thought I had
solved the outback A-battery problem.
While overhauling a battery super, near
Mossman (N.Q.) I happened to flick my
test prods between the chassis, which
was earthed, and an odd-wire dangling
inside the cabinet. A reading of
five volts was obtained. Inspection
showed that the chassis earth was con-
nected to a 3in. galvanised-iron drainpipe,
and the spare wire, I was informed, to
a large sheet of copper. Hence the
potential between the two “earths.” The
electrolyte was the caustic-soda which
drained through the pipe from the wash-
up basin in the kitchen, and was dis-
charged around the copper sheet.
Correspondence.
“Experienced” (Cairns, N.Q.) doesn’t
like superhets: Whilst there are many
arguments for and against T.R.F., it is
quite apparent that manufacturers are
slow to see the advantages of iron-clad
coils in T.R.F. receivers. Let me say that
this type of receiver is the only one
worth buying for such a climate as exists
north of Rockhampton. Superhets may
offer advantages of selectivity when
used in a mild climate, but up here the
humidity keeps them constantly in
trouble. Most dealers here rue the day
superhets were introduced. The manu-
facturer who first makes a worth-while
job incorporating Ferrocart coils will
find a large and ready market in North
Queensland, more so now that the con-
struction of the new relay stations is an
accomplished fact. Keep up your battle
for Ferrocart.

New coil, formers have been produced

samples. They are of bakelite of the
highest dielectric properties. The ex-
ternal diameter is l|in., and ample wind-
ing space is available for all types of in-
ductances. Two \ moulded mounting
brackets are an integral part of the
former, and are in such a position that it
can be mounted on ton of or beneath

Illustrated is the latest type of oxide
rectifier known as a Westector, and
designed for use as detector in radio re-
ceivers. In such a function, the action
is purely that of rectification, and Wes-
tectors do not possess the amplifying
properties of synthetic crystals. This
new type is the WX6, and possesses im-
mediate advantages over previous types.
Owing to the low capacity between the
elements (the discs are only one-sixteenth
of an inch in diameter) it is suitable for
use at 1500 kilocycles. Thus the type
WX6 is applicable to tuned R.F. receivers
as well as to superheterodynes. It can
be used with advantage in a receiver em-
ploying two or three tuned R.F. stages
ahead, and, followed by Class-B audio,
for battery use. The agents for Wes-
tectors are Amplion, Ltd., 70 Clarence-
street, Sydney.

The name Diamond on dry batteries is
known throughout the length and breadth
of Australia. Diamond batteries are used
extensively by the P.M.G.’s Department,
and in such work dependability and en-
durance must be outstanding. Country
radio users should welcome the new
Diamond “Mammoth” 45-volt battery.
This is a battery unit of very large size
with extra long life, and is ideal for
modern batteiy superheterodynes taking
an extra heavy drain. The current prices
of Diamond batteries are: 45-volt
“Mammoth,” 305.; 60-volt “Triple Capa-
city,” 255.; 3H-volt light duty “C,”
6s. 9d.; heavy duty “C,” 7s. 6d.
Diamond batteries also include refills for
fountain-pen torches and cycle-lamps and
cells for all purposes.

The Bulletin’s radio editor was
recently privileged to inspect the latest
devices going through the Kreisler Radio
Co.’s factory, and came to the conclusion
that the new models to be released
shortly will create quite a stir in radio
circles. The Kreisler idea is a big step
forward in the direction of home radio
comfort.
The Q. and A. Column.
My 1932 model seven-valve superhet has
developed a tinny vibrating sound. The trouble
appears after warming up. Also, I suffer
badly from what may be called ground noise,
and to get rid of this 1 often have to turn
the volume back until the station being re-
ceived is barely audible. What’s the cause ?
There are 40,000 -volt lines just outside the
house. —170.
The vibration possibly can be put down to
a faulty valve. A valve with loose elements,
particularly the cathode, can be responsible
for this. This is only one suggestion out of a
possible dozen or so. Get the valves checked
first. Your only hope to reduce the electrical
interference is the combination of screened
lead-in, with the actual aerial as far away
from the high-voltage lines as possible,
and a line filter. Try removing the aerial
from the aerial terminal. If the noise remains
it is either coming through the mains or the
receiver itself is responsible. If the noise
drops in intensity, the aerial is picking it up.
Where can I get a circuit diagram of the
crystal set as referred to by S.G., Vic. (B.
26/9/’34) ? —l7l.
Write to G. McKeown, 11 Beach-road, Hamp-
ton, Melbourne, who will no doubt oblige with
the details of his set.
My knowledge of radio is limited to building
a crystal set. Mention is made (B. 26/9/’34)
of a variometer for use in a crystal set. Wlial
does the reference to stator and rotor mean ?
—172.
A variometer consists of two coils, one being
rotatable inside the other. These coils are con-
nected in series, and variation of the rotor alters
the mutual inductance of the two coils as a
whole. No variable condenser is used, and, by
using a variometer of the kind specified, the
broadcast range can be covered. Although the
arrangement is normally inseleclive, it is much
more efficient than a coil tuned by a condenser,.
being all inductance and very little capacity,
otner than the capacity between the two coils.
To use the variometer in your attached circuit
simply connect it between aerial and earth, dis-
carding the variable condenser.
/ want a good varnish for magneto bobbins,
wireless coils, generators, transformers and
induction coils. It should be moisture-proof,
hard, resistant to heat and a good insulator.
Where can this be procured? —l73.
Ask Taubman’s, Ltd., Mary-street, St. Peters,
N.S.W., for cellulose varnish made for the pur-
pose.
Can you give me a diagram of a really selec-
tive crystal receiver ? Also a suitable single-
valve amplifier to use with it ? —175.
The circuit diagram shows how a crystal
circuit with a band-pass filter is made up. De-
tails of the windings are indicated. The 3in.
diameter coil with 90 turns of 24-gauge wire is
tapped at the centre, and the condenser C
in the aerial circuit is a .00035 mfd. variable.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
Under the Whip
Though the Williamstown Cup re-
mains to be run on Saturday next and
the Bendigo Cup on November 21, the
spring meetings in Victoria have virtu-
ally ended so far as visiting horses are
concerned. The homeward trek of
Sydney trainers began several days ago.
They had a wonderful run of success,
capturing every big turf plum with the
exception of the Maribyrnong Plate.
Races won by gallopers trained in Syd-
ney were: Guineas and Derby, Theo ;
Caulfield Cup, Journal; Herbert Power
Handicap, Broad Arrow ; Werribee Cup,
Veteran Stakes and Final Handicap,
Upoko Ariki; W. S. Cox Plate, Chatham ;
Moonee Valley Cup and Fisher Plate,
Nightly; V.R.C. Wakeful Stakes,
Arachne; Melbourne Stakes, Cup and
Duke of Gloucester Cup, Peter Pan;
Mimosa Stakes, Lady Primrose; Byron
Moore Stakes, Strathardale; Batman
Stakes, Sylvandale; Linlithgow Stakes,
Closing Time.
Peter Pan was, of course, the out-
standing performer. His weight-for-age
victory on the opening day at Fleming-
ton, while masterly, did not quite pre-

pare turf followers for his wonderful
win in the Cup with 9st. 101 b. on a track
fetlock deep in mud. Frank McGrath,
his trainer, almost wept when he reflected
on what “Peter” had to face in the two-
miler; but apparently the silver-maned
chestnut is as great a mudlark and as
indifferent to weight as Chatham proved
himself to be in the last Doncaster
Handicap.
Had he rested on his Melbourne
Cup laurels Peter Pan would have
been acclaimed the equal of Phar Lap ;
but the Duke of Gloucester Cup
on Saturday put a somewhat different
complexion on things. The result of this
event seemed such a foregone conclusion
that odds of 9 to 4 were laid on Rodney
Dangar’s hero. Under the conditions
of the race he carried 31b. less than in
the big Cup, whereas Nightly was up 21b.
and Broad Arrow 91b. Backers regarded
Nightly as the only dangerous rival;
however, it was Broad Arrow (20 to 1)
who fought out the Gloucester Cup finish
with Peter Pan. They had a thrilling
duel down the straight, and Darby
Munro was obliged to ride Peter Pan
right out to score by half a length,
Hyperion (a non-starter in the Melbourne
Cup) being third.
Taking a line through Flemington hap-
penings, it would seem that weight is
not a vital factor in the racing game. If
he had possessed the right to do so, J. H.
Davis must have allotted Peter Pan lOst.
or over in the Duke of Gloucester Cup.
The horse looked to be automatically
thrown in at 9st. 71b.; yet Broad Arrow,
meeting him on 121 b. worse terms than
on the Tuesday, gave Frank McGrath’s
idol the race of his life. When asked by
the Duke whether he had a good run,
Darby Munro stated that he was obliged
to go outside of four horses most of the
way. The jockey exaggerated things
somewhat.
Only seven horses competed, and
two of them —Curator and Wal-
lopian—drew out for a decided lead,
Peter Pan remaining in the rear with
Flail until six or seven furlongs from
home. Actually the favorite moved for-
ward at about the same point that he
did in the Melbourne Cup. Onlookers
expected history to repeat itself; but,
although Peter Pan easily gathered in
the pacemakers, he encountered bitter and
wholly unexpected opposition from
Broad Arrow. There were moments
when the greatest racing boil-over for
many years seemed imminent, but Peter
Pan has the heart of a lion and saved
his supporters from falling deeper into
the clutches of McShortodds. No doubt
his splendid effort on Tuesday had
told on Peter.
Fred Williams was a sad man at the
commencement of the sport at Fleming-
ton on Saturday. Chatham, the star
of his stable for several seasons past,
broke down after a brilliant sprint in
the morning and will have to be retired
from the turf. The trouble is in the fet-
lock joint of the off fore-leg, and has
been pronounced to be irreparable. Up
to a mile, and particularly with a big
weight up, Chatham takes rank with the
greatest gallopers in Australian turf his-
tory. The Linlithgow Stakes would
have been a cakewalk for the son of
Windbag, and it is a terrible pity that
he was deprived of the opportunty of
winning it for the fourth year in succes-
sion. As it was, Closing Time earned a
good stake for Jamieson.
••••••
Williams met with a measure of con-
solation when Sylvandale led home the
Batman Stakes field. This colt had put
up a splendid fight with his stable-mate,
Theo, in the Victoria Derby. Backers
were lucky to obtain 6 to 4 about him
in the Batman. Sylvandale had little
difficulty in winning from the compara-
tive outsider Barak, another Randwick-
trained colt. Sylvandale belongs to
“Lorna Doone,” the wife of a Sydney
doctor.
Juvenile form at Flemington was rather
topsy-turvey. Golden Promise conceded
Strathardale 71b. and defeated him for
second place in the Maribyrnong Plate ;
yet Strathardale easily turned the tables
when they met at even weights in the
Byron Moore Stakes. The course was
a quagmire on Thursday, and this may
have hampered Golden Promise seri-
ously.
Punters received the worst shock of
all when Sweet Trilby, a filly from
Bendigo, landed the Ottawa Stakes, for
which she started at 33 to 1. Sweet
Trilby is by Thrice (son of The Welkin),
and was bred by two young women,
legatees under the will of the late Agar
Wynne, for whom many winners were
trained at Randwick by Tom Payten.
* * * *
Burlesque shows signs of returning to
his three-year-old form. He may win
the Williamstown Cup on Saturday;
Gippsland and La Trobe also take the eye.
* * * *
The outstanding performance at
Moorefield was that of the hitherto un-
ruly Rosaban (14 to 1), a big chestnut
by Arachne’s sire Corban. Bailed off at
the start' of the Highweight, Rosaban
showed so much pace that he led
throughout and won easily from Wina-
sian, who came from a long way back
and is worth following. Charalf hung
on well to get third ; he just beat Raleigh.
Rosaban was ridden expertly by the
apprentice Young, attached to Sam Whit-
bread’s stable.
Moorefield-trained Volwood, a plain-
looking mare by Backwood, raced by
Mrs. H. W. Hill, gave the bookies a
clean sheet in the Moorefield Handicap.
The nominal price was 20 to 1, but no-
body was asked to lay it. The favorite,
Ramrod, looked “home and dry” when he
shot through on the rails at the half-
mile, but his apprentice made the mis-
take of not setting up a good lead. Ram-
rod showed no fight when Volwood threw
out a challenge at the Leger, and she beat
him comfortably to the judge, with Fern-
clove, who tired, a poor third. Dango
and Clangor played cutthroat tactics, and
both had had enough before half-way.
Randwick trainer William Kelso had
no luck with The Marne in Melbourne,
but Buonarroti, carrying his colors, made
$
hacks of the opposition in the Hurstville
Mile. Starting at 5 to 2, he made “no
race” of it; he beat the favorite, Mr.
Kerry, by four lengths, with King Moab
down at the Leger. Mr. Kerry looked
too big, and the support for him was a
surprise.
The Bullhead colt King’s Head, backed
from 9 to 2 to 7 to 4, beat his opponents
very easily in the Three-year-old, and he
looks like developing into a really high-
class galloper. He was never off the bit.
Ruffian, badly away, secured ' second
prize, and the pony Myahmin, after lead-
ing to the turn, was third. Dick Wootton’s
Imitate, second favorite, was in trouble
early, and so was Durga, who looked
trained to the minute.
Wallace Mimi’s half-brother Peter’s
March, who cost 95 guineas as a yearling,
went out at 33 to 1 in the first heat of
the Juvenile. The chestnut' son of March
Along ran greenly, but finished too solidly
for the pacemaker Womblebank and Ash-
bridge. Old Oak, unsteady in the bet-
ting, did not show the same speed as at
Canterbury and could only finish fourth.
Unafraid, a 1100-guinea colt by Heroic,
who is only a 14.2 pony, beat one home.
Shirrob (2 to 1), a neat filly by Bara-
long, who cost owner R. J. Garrett 65
guineas, had to be ridden right out to
annex the second division from Belhead,
with an outsider, Blue Sapphire, a poor
third. Sundrop, the dam of Shirrob, is
by All Black.
{Continued on page 36.)
M.Q. (and Rafferty) Rules
Meyers introduced a lot of Leich-
hardt . tactics —punching, kicking and
crawling under the ropes—when he
wrestled Ali Bey at the Sydney Stadium.
They were of no avail ; Bey beat him
by one fall to none in eight rounds.
Tommy Nylan and King Elliott each
gained a fall at Leichhardt, and their
debate was declared a draw.
The Nineteenth Hole
The second Test between the Austra-
lian and English amateurs in Melbourne
ended all square in the foursomes. Ryan
and Ferrier inflicted a notable licking on
Mac Lean and Bourn, finishing 6 up and
5 to play. McKay and Williams looked
like repeating the dose with Scott and
Garnett, but the Englishmen outstayed
them and won 3 and 1.
* * * *
The Australian professional golfers
made a sorry showing against their
American brethren in their match at
Sydney Lakes Club at the week-end,
losing all nine matches, singles and four-
somes, by considerable margins. J. D.
Spence made the best showing for Aus-
tralia in the singles, only succumbing to
Cooper 2 and 1. Bolger, Australian open
champion, played a fine round of 72
against Laffoon, but was eventually
beaten 3 and 1. The Americans’ con-
sistency and concentration on shots was
an eye-opener to Australian spectators.
Their combination and mutual under-
standing in the foursomes left the home
players standing.
* * * *
“Carnoustie”: Britain will have to do
without Cotton in the Ryder Cup contest
between teams of Amei'ican and British
professionals next year. To play for the
Cup one must be residing in the country
represented. For some years past, Cotton
has been professional at Waterloo, in
Belgium. His contract expires this year,
and it was not expected that he would
renew it. Renewed it he has, and so
automatically scratches himself for the
international v event.
• . * * *
“Divot Digger”: A N. S. Wales
golfer whom one expects to hold
his own against the American pro-
fessionals in the big Melbourne stuff
is V. S. Richardson. He is the most
consistent player in Australia, and has
done as well on Melbourne courses as
on his native heath. His eight consecu-
tive rounds in the recent N.S.W. profes-
sional and close championship averaged
71.6, good enough to win in any com-
pany and on any course in the world.
* * * *
“Spoof”: A Sydney newspaper came
out with a cablegram stating that
the American professional golfers were
attended by six cullud gemmen as cad-
dies, each clad in a uniform which
would pale that of the D. of G. Natur-
ally the Customs and the agents of the
ship who would have to find the finan-
cial guarantee for landing the caddies
attended the berthing of the craft in
force. / There were no coon caddies ;
only one sunburned gentleman attired in
unusually fantastic American golfing cos-
tume who was accompanying the team
as a tourist. An unnamed M.L. press-
man is blamed for the comic blunder.
(Continued on page 36.)
“Poppet”: Australian rowing suffered
what the old-time pugs used to call a
postman’s knock on the dial on Satur-
day. In other words, the London R.C.
paddled away with the Victorian eights
championship on the Yarra while the
best of the Sydney clubs were outclassed
by the Wanganui (M.L.) crew on the
Parramatta. London finished eight
lengths ahead of Uni., but the latter
takes the State title under the rules. The
All-Blacks repeated their feat of 1925,
and were stroked by the same man —C
Healey. Turner, of N.S.W., easily re-
tained the 2000-metre sculls.
* * * *
“Christoph”: Cricket and Rugby
League clubs in Australia set up a peri-
odical howl when English clubs make
large offers to promising youngsters to
play in the Old Country, but it’s seldom
that Soccer concerns have cause to join
them. v Perth saw an instance the other
day. Jack Conduit, the Victoria Park
team’s centre-forward, had a cable from
Blackpool; the money must have been
good, because he’d packed and left
within a fortnight'. Conduit has a great
record as a goal-getter, and a consistent-
scoring centre is worth his weight in
gold in Soccer. Blackpool is lying fourth
in the second division of the League.

Under the Whip
A great horse in good shape is great
in all sorts of weather, and weight does
not seem to affect him much. Peter
Pan, carrying 9st. 101 b. on the wettest
Melbourne Cup Day for 42 years, and
posted on the outside of a field of 22,
made his opponents look like com-
moners.
Being on the outside was no handicap,
for the going was not so bad there, but
it was still sodden. Ninth or tenth most
of the way, Peter Pan made a fast run
approaching the home turn, where Flail,
Rogilla, Panto, Sarcherie and Nightly
were in front of him. Two furlongs
from home, he had the race won. Finish-
ing much more strongly than anything
else, he landed the £BOOO first prize and
the £2OO trophy for R. R. Dangar by
three lengths from Sarcherie (50 to 1),
who rather astonished the Melbourne
people by her forward showing, though
Sydney men who had seen her in the
Metrop. were not unprepared for it. A
neck behind J. J. Leahy’s mare was La
Trobe (25 to 1). Broad Arrow led a
straggling lot of unplaced horses, Gipps-
land, Hall Mark, Sylvandale and Flail
following. The last pair were Nightly
and Sir Simper; and they were the
favorites.
Backing favorites in doubles on im-
portant races is an idiotic pursuit. Not
once in a blue moon do they win, and
the price is invariably preposterous.
Weeks before the two Cups mugs took
20 to 1 Rogilla and Peter Pan. Rogilla
was 6 to 1 on Caulfield Cup Day (he
lost, of course) and Peter Pan eased to
14 to 1 at Flemington—he was 9 to 1
the previous night. It was understand-
able that Sir Simper should be favorite,
in view of his light weight and his good
finish in the Caulfield Cup, but the posi-
tion of Nightly in the betting was utterly
irrational, and he demonstrated it to
the discomfiture of his backers.
The conditions should have suited the
three-year-olds, but they were not cap-
able of taking advantage of them. A
poorer lot of youngsters has rarely con-
tested a Cup race. Theo was never in the
hunt, and Moss is a very lucky man to
have won the two Derbys and the
Guineas with such a second-rater. Five
to one the morning of the Derby, Theo
drifted to twice those odds after his
slovenly performance in that race. Also
on the 10-to-l mark were Broad Arrow,
Journal (who contracted colic or some-
thing, though he completed the course)
and Limbohm from Maoriland, a strong,
eleventh-hour tip.
Hall Mark and Rogilla were 14 to L
Rogilla was in front for a time, and over
the concluding five furlongs Hall Mark
went from last to sixth. Small though
he is, the weight, 9st. 21b., perhaps both-
ered him less than the going. But, wet or
dry, with a clear run for all, none of
them would have stood a chance with
Peter Pan, who, in doing what no other
horse has done since Archer’s day,
proved himself one of the grandest Aus-
tralian horses in history. The time,
3min. 40£sec., was the slowest since 1868,
Glencoe’s year, but that does not detract
from the superlative merit of Peter Pan’s
performance. The trainer, Frank Mc-
Grath, and the jockey, Darby Munro,
shared in the lustre of it—the trainer
more than the jockey, for Peter Pan has
given him many anxious moments.
In appearance Peter Pan is a powerful
chestnut by Pantheon —Alwina. There
is St. Simon blood in him on both sides
of the house, and Musket blood on the
dam’s side. He traces back to Chester
also. Better than Phar Lap? Not up
to a mile and a quarter, but surely Phar
Lap’s equal over a journey.
South Australian horses did well on
Cup Day, Bumburnie winning the
Hurdle race and Woodlace the Steeple-
chase. And the former S. Aus. jockey
Sing saddled up winners of three impor-
tant races—Sculpin in the Highweight
Handicap, Nellie’s Tip and Perfumery in
divisions of the Yan Yean Stakes. He
trains all three for A. Morrow. Olsen
rode Nellie’s Tip and Perfumery.
South Australia also scored with
Alinura (5 to 2) in the Oaks, and if
O Sullivan hadn’t lost an iron Allenby—
third to Alinura in the S.A.J.C. Derby—
might have been first instead of third —•
to Villius and Bunsby Gaze—in the
Carnival Handicap. Alinura outstayed
Quarto and Daughter of the Wind in a
severe race on a track so heavy after
three days’ rain that it took them 2min.
52fsec. to run out the 12 furlongs. By
King of Mirth (son of Comedy King) out
of Menura, she has had four successes
this season, but is really not much good.
Great mares have been rare on the Aus-
tralian turf though Trenton sired two —
Wakeful and Auraria.
Apparently the Cup race knocked out
Hall Mark more than it did Nightly;
anyway, the Maorilander, 4 to 1 in a field
of three, comfortably accounted for the
“It’s a ’orrible walk from the dressin’-room to the ring.
“But you’ll on’y ’ave to walk one way.”
1933 Derby-and-Cup winner in the C. B.
Fisher Plate, run in 2min. 53isec. In
good going positions might have been
reversed.
Ins and Outs
In the absence of McCabe and
O’Reilly, N.S.W. has had a hard job
getting a team together for the match
against South Australia in Sydney next
week. Kippax skippers the side, and
others with Sheffield experience are Old-
field, Brown, Chipperfield, Fingleton,
Chilvers, Hill, McGilvray and Theak.
Newcomers are Simmons, a medium
right-hand bowler from Western Suburbs,
who bats better than a bit, and Horsfield,
a left-handed forcing batsman from
Mosman, who also bowls slow right-
hand stuff. McGilvray, another left-
hander, did the southern trip with the
Ma Staters last year. The bowling is
nearly all of the same slow type. The
inclusion of Theak, a fast-medium
trundler who has had chances enough,
is a confession of inability to rake up a
real speed merchant.
* * * *
“Glenelg”: N.S.W. won’t see many
new faces in the South Australian
Eleven which starts the Sheffield season
in Sydney next week. The wicket-keeper,
F.« R. Edwards, is no stranger ; he played
for Gordon with Macartney and Kelle-
way a few seasons ago. Now in East
Torrens he takes the place of the 1930
spare-stumper Walker, who has retired
from the big stuff. One lad who just
missed the ’bus was R. J. Scott, a son
of “Scotty” whose tremendous pace
for a few overs made him a formidable
opening bowler for N.S.W. and South
Australia some years back.
* * * *
“Waverley”: Alan Kippax has an-
nounced his retirement from the N.S.W.
captaincy, though he will continue play-
ing if selected. He suggests McCabe as
his successor, and this will probably
come to pass. Mac has personality,
which counts for much in captaincy, and
he should know the game by heart now.
Kippax will have to officiate in the open-
ing match in Sydney with South Aus-
tralia, for McCabe, though he will play
in the Woodford benefit in Melbourne,
has struck for a spell to visit his folk at
Grenfell. His first appearances as skipper
will probably be in the return match at
Adelaide and in the Victorian game in
Melbourne.
* * * *
“Blah”: For weeks the Board of Con-
trol has been slated because it is paying
members of the Australian Eleven £6OO-
- apiece and not adding the favorable
exchange incurred in transferring the
takings in England to Australia. If the
board had done so, each man would
have got £720, in addition to first-class
travelling and hotel expenses, and, in
certain cases, heavy surgical and medical
expenses. As it is, there will be a mere
£2OOO for the board to share out among
the State associations for the improve-
ment of grounds and the coaching of
youngsters. In justice to the players
themselves, not a squeal has come from
that quarter.
“Aelred B.”: The ignoring of Banana-
landers for the Rest of Australia side for
the Woodfull-Ponsford testimonial is
causing a rare old shindy in the northern
State. It isn’t that they think talent
has been overlooked—though Oxenham,
Levy and Andrews might have been pre-
ferred to some others already in the side
—so much as that Queensland is the only
Shield State left out of the testimonial
circus. Expense was alleged to be the
reason, but the Q.C.A. was willing to
find fares for any of its men as far as
Sydney, thus putting them on the same
footing as the Welshmen. Westralia,
too, wanted to have a finger in the pie,
and offered to pay all costs if one of
its men was included.
% * * *
“Barney”: Two cricket umpires cov-
ered themselves with mud and glory of a
sort at Lismore (N.S.W.) recently. The
ball was belted into the long grass and
the batsmen ran six. One umpire sig-
nalled a six, the other reckoned that it
was only a four. The argument between
them held the game up for 15 minutes.
Next Saturday a bowler let the ball
slip into the air above his head. This
started the umps. off again. One yelled
“No ball,” the other roared “Wide.”
Both kept it up until they were shouted
down by the fieldsmen. Then one ump.
grabbed the bails from the stumps at
his end, and tore off home on his bicycle.
After that peace descended on the scene.
* * * *
“Tenth Slip”: O’Reilly administered a
facer to the Australian and N.S.W. cricket
heads when he announced on his return
that he had finished with Sheffield and
international cricket, and was going to
settle down to his profession of school-
teaching, in which he is well advanced.
No one will quarrel with the sensible
decision, though one may regret the loss
of the best bowler Australia has fluked
upon since McDonald. O’Reilly will
play in the Melbourne testimonial match,
and that will be his only big game this
year. Ho told an English interviewer of
his intention three months ago, but no
one on this side seems to have heeded
the warning.
The Nineteenth Hole
“Camel”: When it was found that the
visiting American professional golfers
had brought no caddies with them, a
contingent of Sydney experts waited on
them and were engaged. Their job is not
going to be a soft one, judging by a press
photo, of the chap who will have the
honor to hump for Diegel. “Hump” is
the right word, for, though he is a hefty
lad, the picture shows him bowed
beneath an immense bag containing
seven woods and 19 irons!
* * * *
“Hamilton”: The American golfers
swept down from the clouds on Brisbane
last week —to abandon metaphor they
flew up in a ’plane—and played a one-
day fixture against their brother profes-
sionals of Queensland. The result was a
massacre, the Yanks winning all the
singles and foursomes. Of the locals A.
Denholm and C. Brown squared their
singles with Cooper and Diegel, and that
was Bananaland’s best showing.
H* * * H=
“Brassey”: In their match with the
British amateurs in Sydney, the N.S.W.
lilywhites made a much better showing
than the Australian team a week before.
They won both the foursomes, in which
the visitors were supposed to be unbeat-
able, the heroes being Ferrier-Hughes,
who downed MacLean-Bourn 4 and 3, and
McKay-Waterson, who scrambled home,
1 up, from Scott and Garnett. In the
singles McKay won from Scott, 2 and 1,
but Mac Lean, Garnett and Bourn won
their games and made the match a three-
all draw. Mac Lean was again the star

74 YEARS
OLD BUT
-LIFE
WORTH
LIVING
AGAIN
‘FIRST DOSE RELIEVED THE PAIN”
says Mr. E. Kelland of Exeter, who writes:—
"For a long time I suffered severe pains
in my stomach ; it seemed to be getting
worse until I dreaded eating anything.
The pain got so bad I was afraid I had a
malignant growth in my stomach. I was
advised to try ‘Bisurated’ Magnesia—the
very first dose relieved the pain and now
I can eat practically anything without
any pain whatever. I am 74 years old
and life seems worth living again.”
What appeared to Mr. Kelland to be a
serious disease proved to be another case
of Acidity! This condition is prevalent
among men and women of all ages and is
responsible for such ailments as indiges-
tion, gastritis, stomach ulcers, headaches,
biliousness, insomnia, etc.—all symp-
toms of acidity. It’s marvellous how
'Bisurated’ Magnesia attacks and defeats
acidity —it’s amazing how it gives such
quick and lasting relief —the reason is
that it instantly removes the cause.
There is no more effective antacid
than 'Bisurated’ Magnesia—that is why
doctors and hospitals have used and
recommended it for over 20 years and
still consider it has no rival.

l\ Millions Were Spent to
Make Her Comfortable
When she sinks back in her Holden-bodied car,
she rides in comfort and safety that an invest-
ment of £1,500,000 makes possible. Without
the vast production and far-reaching rami-
fications of the Holden organisation, motor-
car bodies of Holden quality would be within
the reach of only the few—instead of the
thousands who own and enjoy them to-day.
The main Holden plant at Woodville, South
Australia, covers 40 acres, including 1,000,000
square feet of covered space. Plant and mach-
inery to a value of over £700,000 are installed
in these buildings, in which are carried huge
stocks of Australian timber, leather, steel, etc.,
and other raw material. In all, more than
£1,500,000 is invested in this plant, which
employs 3400 Australians.
The plant has over 20 departments, and as
each Holden body passes through these depart-
merits, it receives no less than 1213 progress
inspections before being “ O.K.’d” for delivery.
No wonder “Body by Holden” carries such a
wealth of meaning—both as the product of a
vitally important Australian secondary industry
—and as a refinement in motoring comfort and
pride of ownership.

“Hoylake”: Diegel is using a fantastic
putter with a “heel” of a type banned
by St. Andrews. It recalls a row in
England on the subject. In the 1900’s,
two American amateur champions
figured in the big British events. One
staggered the golfing world by produc-
ing a wry-necked affair he called a
Schenactady putter. St. Andrews ruled
it out, and has been notably nasty to-
wards American golfing imitations ever
since.
* * * *
“No. 7”: The contemporaries of that
golf-ball “finder” who got a fortnight
when caught at Moore Park (B.
17/10/’34) should take a high-diving
course in readiness for the opening of
the Waverley Municipal Council’s 9-hole
course, now in course of construction on
windy slopes leading up to Ben Buckler.
Perhaps, though, fine-mesh net could be
spread at the top of the cliff.
* * * *
“Southport”: One of the troubles of
the maker of modern golf balls is to find
a satisfactory viscous liquid for the centre
—an essential. In earlier makes materials
like collodion and other explosives were
used—there is a record of a railway
fettler being blinded and dying from the
effects of the explosion of a ball
driven into a brazier of coal be-
side which he was working on the
line. It is now proclaimed that the per-
fect material has been found where no
one expected it. It is common or garden
honey. It fulfills all the requirements,
and won’t burn or burst from expansion
on hot days, while the essential “gooi-
ness” is maintained under all conditions.
Bee-farmers please note.
* * * *
“R.M.”: It isn’t often that Westralian
golf teams are seen in action on this side,
but last week W.A. men made a good
showing against a strong Vic. lot skip-
pered by Mick Ryan. The match was of
singles, with four on each side and a four-
baller—rather unusual for a game of this
description. The singles ended with Vic-
toria 2\ to the others Bennett, of
Westralia, downing Cade and Rogers
squaring with Rae. In the four-baller
the Vies, won both games, Ryan and
Jackson 4 and 3 and Cade and Rae
1 up.
Racquet and Bawl
“Top Spin”: Kirby and Menzel made
their appearance in Sydney last week.
The Czech is a giant, hitting tremen-
dously hard on both hands, though
he is handicapped at present by an ankle
injury. Kirby impressed the more on
his first appearance. He is a master of
almost every shot and as quick as Perry—
if not a bit quicker—covering the court.
Nevertheless, if Menzel gets over his
injury and strikes form he will make the
best of them gallop in Melbourne. Watch-
ing him at work one soon realised that
it was not Crawford’s lapses which helped
the big fellow to knock him out at
Wimbledon.
* =s= * *
“Matamata”: The English tennis
players did not have a happy spin
in their M.L. matches. Dorothy Round
was beaten by a local star, Miss Baver-
ley, at Rotorua. More significant was
the defeat for the second time of Perry
by Hughes, who, ordinarily, could not
live with the English champion. It is not
unlikely that Perry’s strenuous American
tour up to the time of sailing from
’Frisco has staled him, as The Bulletin
suggested some weeks ago.
* * * *
“Ichabod”: How fleeting an ember is
fame is instanced by a coincidence in
London a month or so ago. Don Brad-
man was in a dangerous condition after
an operation, and his progress, good or
bad, filled the English news-sheets, to the
exclusion of almost everything else. At
the same time, but just across the creek
they call the Channel, Suzanne Lenglen
also lay at Death’s door after a spin with
the surgeons. She got a three-line par.,
which was not repeated. Yet a few years
ago Suzanne was the idol of a vaster
public than Bradman will ever command,
ruled the tennis world with a rod of iron
and even kept an Empress waiting on
her pleasure at Wimbledon.
* * * *
“Cut Shot”: Tennis has such a vogue
now in the State schools that the N.S.W.
heads have opened their hearts and
arranged concessions to youngsters who
want to see the visiting internationals,
special rates of 2s. and Is. being charged.
The days available are November 21,
when the women start their matches, and
November 28, when all the quarter-finals
will be played. A number of schools
booked seats as soon as the announce-
ment was made, one taking a block of
150. Teachers, of course, share the kids’
privileges. It is a wise move. Half an
hour of watching a crack athlete or team,
whatever the sport be, gives an infinitely
better knowledge of a game than a
month’s coaching or ordinary match-play
with equals.
* * * s
“Rushcutter”: In order to give the
groundsmen a chance to get the White
City courts into perfect condition for the
big internationals next month, the N.S.W.
L.T.A. is closing the ground from
November 14 to December 2. Those
who will be looking for practice courts
by then will number eight overseas
visitors and close on 20 players from
various States, including a batch from
Queensland.
Miscellaneous
“Quarter Butt”: Joe Davis gave
Horace Lindrum a lesson in snooker in
their match for £lOO a side in Mel-
bourne, winning by 46 games to 29. The
young Australian, unbeatable at the game
in his own country, should benefit im-
mensely by his match with the world’s
champion. Of all games, snooker is the
one in which a player can only score as
well as the other fellow likes to let him.
If he had won Horace was to have gone
to England with Joseph. As the latter
left by himself for his native land last
week, that may all be considered as off.
* * * *
“Dedans”: The mediaeval pastime
which we call to-day “royal tennis” still
commands the esteem of a few addicts
in Hobart and Melbourne, the only
places where the costly enclosed courts
are to be found in this country. The
Australian championship for the Gold
Racquet was played in Melbourne dur-
ing Cup week and was won by K. Tol-
hurst, who downed Gerald Patterson,
holder of the title, by 3 sets to 2.
* * * *
“Kick Starter”: The Tourist Trophy
races for motor-cycles held on the
Phillip Island (Vic.) road circuit on Cup
day were spoiled by the horrible
weather. In the morning it was possible
to run off the junior and lightweight
events and the sidecar championship.
The roads were in such a dangerous con-
dition by then that the stewards, in spite
of bitter protests, called the Senior T.T.
event off. The Junior went to F. Mussett
(Vic.) on a 348 Velo. The time for the
75 miles was lhr. 2min. 28sec. and aver-
age speed 76 m.p.h. L. F. Pratt (Vic.)
won both the lightweight and sidecar
events, the first on a 246-c.c. Sunbeam,
and the second with a 493 machine of
the same make. In the first event the
time for the 75 miles was lhr. 15min.
30sec. ; in the second, 50 miles was cov-
ered in 48min. 39sec.
* * * *
“Spare Walton”: One of Britain’s most
important annual sporting events came
off at Abingdon-on-Thames last month.
This was the All-England angling cham-
pionship. Fifty-three teams of 12 fisher-
men from all the leading clubs took
part, and 40 bookmakers laid odds up
to 200 to 1 against uncertain performers.
The anglers were searched before taking
up their posts, and a cordon of stewards
warded off non-competitors trying to get
near the contestants. This was because
last year a loving wife brought her hus-
band a huge pie for lunch. Its size
attracted suspicion and it was seized. In-
side half a dozen live fish were swim-
ming. As the average Thames fish is
what we would call in Australia a
“tiddler,” the contents of the pie might
have decided the championship.
* * * *
“Hotham”: Vic. critics were flabber-
gasted by the nonchalant win of the
London R.C. in the Grand Challenge
Cup at Henley-on-Yarra. What gravelled
the trumpeters of the old “orthodox”
style, which won Victoria so many races
in the past, was that the visitors at times
kept their lead or went away from the
opposition stroking a leisurely 23 while
the enemy was sweating at 30-33. The
Fairbairn style—as pointed out in The
Bulletin months ago—aims not only <.t
getting pace on the boat, but at not losing
any of it when coming forward for the
catch. The boat is running all the time
and the check so familiar with other
styles is absent.

ganisation, and it wastes no time. As
soon as Major Miller, grey-haired,
waxed-moustached and stiff as a ramrod,
stands before it the music commences.
Conductor and musicians (it' is lese-
majeste to call them bandsmen) are in
perfect accord. The motions of the
Major’s baton describe but short orbits
and betray never the least departure
from military decorum. He wears a
sword. On the conclusion of each item
he wheels crisply and salutes the audi-
ence, the band rising simultaneously with
machine-like promptitude. Once, after
a particularly roguish scamper through
a merry Sullivan score, there seemed to
be the ghost of a smile in the conduc-
torial eye, but it was so faint no one
could swear to it.
• It’s a particularly well-balanced band,
and the only word for the tone it evokes
is “bland.” In quiet passages it makes
one think of Keats’s “drowsy syrops,”
and it can manage the longest-sustained
of crescendoes without developing a blare.
Its march-playing is a model for all mili-
tary bands —springily crisp, with fre-
quent variations of color and just enough
emphasis on accent to avoid monotony
in the statement of the tritest theme.
Grieg, Wagner, Liszt, Bizet, Rimsky-
Korsakov and even Debussy figure in the
programmes, and the varying character-
istics of these harmonists are presented
accurately, efficiently and, above all, with
such easiness of style that there is no
sense of strain on either conductor or
performers. No doubt is left that strict
military discipline is a splendid thing for
musicians who must play concertedly.
The Russian Ballet’s change of pro-
gramme at Sydney Royal on Saturday
was marked by more verve and variety
and better dressing than the previous
week’s offerings. The opening number,
“Visions” (music by Tschaikowsky, chore-
ography by Petipa), a Prince Charming-
Sleeping Beauty woodland romance,
afforded Natasha Bojkovich better
opportunities for her talents than have
been previously given her. Her graceful
flutterings, swoops and leaps were a joy
to the eye. Stanley Judson, as the Prince,
and Molly Lake, as the Lilac Fairy, were
well in the picture. “Carnival” (music
by Schumann, choreography by Fokine)
was executed in front of decorative cur-
tains, and provided an excellent medium
for Olga Spessiva. As Columbine, ar-
rayed in crinoline, she was a sparkling
tease, and kept ardent Arlequin (Anatole
Vilzak) and Messrs. Pantaloon (Paul
Petroff) and Pierrot (M. Kemp) in a state
of alternate expectation and disappoint-
ment. Mile. Spessiva also appeared with
Anatole Vilzak in “Pas Hongrois Clas-
sique” (music by Glazounoff).

“Jonah and the Whale,” in which
James Bridie tells the story in modern
Shavian dramatic idiom, is a good play
for amateurs, and the Sydney Players’
Club gave a reasonably competent inter-
pretation of it. John Appleton, the pro-
ducer, made the best of his small stage
with simple and effective settings.
Edward Cavill’s Jonah was a sincere and
careful bit of work, and John Cope-
man’s Billshan was full of life. The
rest of the cast gave sound support.
It is one of the best things the club has
done.

Oscar Wilde’s “Salome” as presented
by the Sydney Impressionists was a
colorful affair, though it revealed an un-
suspected Herodian taste in furniture.
The cosmopolitan prince would no
doubt be delighted to see himself in a
Chinese chair, however, and the touch
might have provided Wilde with an epi-
gram. On the whole, with its long
speeches and situations which call for
supreme art, the company’s performance
reminded the onlooker of a small man
leading a large and unwilling elephant,
but there were some bright spots. Gwen
Sherwood made a creditable job of the
role of Herodias, and Irene Vera Young’s
dancing was charming, if not as sinuous
as is expected of a Salome. Wilfred
Blackett as Herod was monotonous, but
he did not have a fair chance. He learnt
his role in a few hours to fill a gap.
Gregan McMahon has never done
better work than his portrayal of Shep-
pey, in Somerset Maugham’s play of
that name at Melbourne Garrick. Never
once did he fault in depicting the decent,
good-natured old barber whose only
weakness was his pride as a craftsman.
Maugham based “Sheppey” on a short
story he wrote many years ago. It con-
cerns a journeyman hairdresser who won
£BOOO in the Irish sweep and .who un-
fortunately had, for the first time in his
life, attended a police court and come
into contact with the misery and poverty
of which the average citizen has no
knowledge. It so affected him that he
proposed to carry out the teaching of
the New Testament literally and give
all he had to the poor. The horror and
indignation of his daughter and his pros-
pective son-in-law led to his being certi-
fied as a lunatic, and he died just in time
to avert removal to an asylum. The play
drags at times, but the fault is that of
the author, for the acting, on the whole,
was good and in spots excellent. There
are some nice touches of satire, as when
Sheppey’s wife explains that she had no
suspicions of insanity when she saw him
studying the Bible because she thought
he was doing a crossword puzzle, and
the plea of the son-in-law that if Jesus
did say that piece about giving all to
the poor He didn’t mean it, as any
parson would tell you. Eileen Ragg, who
played Sheppey’s wife, shares the honors
with Gregan McMahon. Her acting of
the kindly old Cockney woman was in
the first rank. Eve Wynne, Paul
O’Loughlin and Thelma Besant also
scored.
At the conclusion of the first act of
“Blue Mountain Melody” the Duke went
behind and congratulated Madge Elliott
on her performance and on her engage-
ment. He also handed out an unsoli-
cited testimonial to the musical comedy,
remarking that he had been told that it
was 100 per cent. Australian, and, if that
were the case, Australia need have no
fear as to its ability to produce its own
musical comedies.

If his Infernal Majesty had surveyed
Horace Stevens’s performance as Mephis-
topheles in the the Fuller produc-
tion of “Faust” at Melb. Apollo last
week, he might have brought out an in-
junction for defamation of character.
Not only were Stevens’s demonstrations
of supernatural prowess inferior to those
of the average suburban conjuror, but
his general attitude lacked the malice,
spite, vindictiveness and ferocity of a
torturer in permanent employment. His
initial miracle, which consisted in turn-
ing the aged Dr. Faustus Ben Williams
into a youth of prepossessing appear-
ance, would have been more astonish-
ing if the arms of the seeker of immor-
tality had not been visible struggling out
of a coat above the screen, behind which
he retired for twenty seconds. After
that Gounod’s version of Goethe’s
mighty tragedy could only be accepted
as good fun, plus good melodrama, plus
some delightfully melodious numbers
and some very t'ripey ones. Stevens’s
singing was on a par with his legs, which
are magnificent. Ben Williams sold
his soul into eternal damnation in the
sweetest of tenors and subsequently
seduced Marguerite with an irresistible
display of voice production. The latter
lady, in the person of Thea Philips, was
adequate vocally, but was distinctly
lightweight in the acting division. Dur-
ing her transports over the discovery of
a casket stuffed with the loot of a whole
jeweller’s shop, she showed as much ex-
citement as if she were peeling potatoes.
Still, Gounod didn’t' make Marguerite
anything much more than a sort of
Middle Ages high-school graduate.
Marguerite’s brother Valentine had to
be resurrected from the dead in order that
Bernard Ross should receive the plaudits
due to an outstanding performance.
Freda Shacks’s Seibel and Gwladys Gar-
side’s Martha were of the same high
standard as the rest of an excellent pro-
duction which was handsomely dressed
in the clothes of various periods which
for some reason or other audiences re-
gard as romantic. “Faust” isn’t a good
opera, but it is an attempt at a good
opera, which in the garden scene and
the church scene goes half-way to Wag-
nerian felicity of expression and unity of
action and music.

Edouard Lambert (violin), Elford Mack
(’cello) and Vera Bradford (piano) were
the principal contributors to the pro-
gramme of the Melbourne Chamber
Music Club at the Victoria Banqueting
Hall. Beethoven’s Trio in E Flat Major,
op. 70, was the chief business of the
evening, and left a very clear impression.
Bach’s Sonata in A Major, No. 2, had
the services of Lambert’s violin, whose
owner is both a delicate and forceful
player. Soprano Greta Callow spangled
the air with some Mozartian melodies.
Another inspection of “The Valkyrie”
at Melbourne Apollo confirms this
paper’s earlier expressed opinion that if
Wagner had started the Fuller ball roll-
ing the present belated boom would have
lasted the whole season. The queues at
the box-office for the Wagner evenings
tell their own story, for the news has got
around that with such a fine cast, headed
by Florence Austral, “The Valkyrie is
something unique in local entertainment.
Moreover, in many people’s opinions, it
will stand comparison with the best
European productions. As a result of
the popular enthusiasm, “Tristan and
Isolde” and “Tannhauser” are to be at-
tached to the tail of the departing season,
with “Lohengrin” as a possibility.

Sunshine Gold
In August last attention was here
drawn to unofficial reports floating round
Pitt-street, Sydney, concerning the affairs
of Sunshine Gold Development, Ltd. The
secretary of the co. (Mr. Hammond) was
interviewed. He spoke optimistically,
sometimes enthusiastically, of the co.’s
prospects. But the unofficial informa-
tion which the market had got hold of
had been enough to send the lOs.-paid
shares toppling from 455. to 265. They
weakened further, at one stage touching
12s. At last week-end they were round
155., with the bears still busy.
The market’s first doubts were whether
the co.’s leases —principal of these are
on the Ono and Watut rivers in New
Guinea and Fish Creek and Lakekamu
River in Papua—would yield as much
gold as official reports suggested. This
is still unproven. The present co. was
floated as far back as November,
1933, the registered office being in
Canberra. It took over from a co. that
had already been in existence some time
—Sunshine (N.G.) Gold Development,
Ltd. —its interests in the 22-acre Goldfoil
claim, the 350-acre Sunshine claim on
the Watut, the 30-acre Gorge claim, and
five claims near the Ono and Waria
rivers aggregating 2500 acres. The new
co. paid £30,000 in 10s. fully-paids to
the vendors, and 60,000 shares were
offered for cash. The extra capital was
required to take over the leases and
options and to test the properties further,
preparatory to the formation of one or
more operating cos.
In August a report that the co. had
lost two of its best leases was denied
verbally by Mr. Ham-
mond. But official cir-
culars to shareholders
have been vague. For
instance: “The directors
understand that un-
founded rumors have been
circulating regarding the
company and its opera-
tions. The directors desire
to assure shareholders
that everything is being
carried out according to
programme, and that they
have no reason for doubt-
ing the anticipated success of the
company. As soon as specific infor-
mation regarding the drilling of the bal-
ance of the Consolidated claims is avail-
able it will be published. In the mean-
time the shareholders are advised to await
official results.”
That was on November 2. Share-
holders feel that they have been “await-
ing official results” too long. The direc-
tors should be able to assure them
whether or not the co. has clear titles
to leases, one in particular. Those gen-
tlemen are assured that' the rumors pre-
viously mentioned, if they wish to check
up on them, are very insistent around the
Stock Exchange saleboard.
The Devil Is Sick
More people in the world are now
interested in currency and credit matters
than ever before.
With a few exceptions, such as the
Stable Money Association of New York
and our more far-seeing bankers, in the
“good” times not many of the so-called
currency enthusiasts were worrying about
economics. James Edmond and S. H.
Prior of The Bulletin, who saw what
was coming in our railway and public
finance, were looked upon as pessimists.
The boom was on; the boom was
here to stay. Prices kept moving up,
and moneymaking was simple. Land
bought this year was sold for double
the money next year. With bor-
rowing easy and interest rates high, it
was hard to keep inflation out of prices.
High prices spelt high wages, high profits
and high debts. Legitimate producers—
manufacturers, wheat- and woolgrowers,
banana- and sugar-planters—were all
penalised by the speculators’ figures
which they had to pay for land.
There is a great deal of talk at present
about utilising and capitalising the
“national income.” During the borrow-
ing mania the whole of the national in-
come and a great deal more that was bor-
rowed was spent. Hoover in America,
before being displaced by Roosevelt, had
a slogan, “You can’t squander your
way to prosperity.” Much of our bor-
rowed money was spent on essential and
useful public works ; but much was also
expended unwisely, and with far too
lavish a hand.
A great deal of the artificial prosperity
which followed in the redistribution of
these borrowings was due to the pledging
of our credit. Many of the loans came
into Australia in the form of imported
goods, so that even our manufacturing
classes didn’t derive a reasonably lasting
benefit.
What the world needs is stable money,
or, at least, money which maintains a
true economic ratio in relation to prices
of goods and services—money and
prices, in other words, with the hot air
expelled. The borrower in boom times
buys a lot of hot air when he expends
his loan ; when the time comes for re-
payment the inflation may have all
oozed out of values, leaving the borrower
faced with bankruptcy.
A man with a currency theory, if he
wants to get anywhere, has first of all
to acknowledge that booms are as un-
healthy as slumps. The ideal currency
would be one that would function with-
out bulges and busts. The trouble is
that it is so easy to turn a blind eye
to the bulges.
“It’s 70 horse-power, sir”
“Aw, bring me something with an engine in it.”
Bill Finance
“E.D.0.”: The findings of a Maori-
land Monetary Committee should make
Australia look to her laurels in
financial reform, more especially in
the matter of efficient and modern
finance for agricultural produce await-
ing sale in woolstore and silo. London
bill rates on this class of finance hover
around 1 p.c. Our Commonwealth Bank
charges the farmer 3| p.c. The excuse
is that the charter doesn’t allow it to
deal in trade bills.
Sections 65 and 66 of the M.L. report
are illuminating, coming from a conser-
vative body. “The operations of the
Reserve Bank would be facilitated if
more use were made of trade bills. The
use of negotiable documents, instead of
bank advances, would cheapen the cost
of credit for trading operations. The
difficulty with the overdraft method of
financing transactions is that the loan is
not automatically paid off when the trans-
action is completed. The method of financ-
ing production and sale of goods by over-
draft is profitable to the financial in-
stitution, costly to the borrower and
often not the soundest of operations.”
Further, “in the interests of trade and
finance the Reserve Bank will doubtless
encourage the more extensive use of
bills.”
Producers hope that Australian finan-
cial authorities will bring their machin-
ery into stride with modern develop-
ments so that the price of finance to the
producer may be in accord with open-
market rates, just as his returns are set
by open-market prices.
How Gold Is Paid For
“Bank Clerk”: Having read your in-
teresting article, “If France Quits Gold”
(B. 17/10/’34), I should like to elaborate
on one phrase you use, and that is: “The
Australian price of the metal is roughly
25 p.c. above the London rate.” What
many gold-producers don’t know is that
the London quote is for fine gold 100 p.c.
pure only.
The price paid by the banks is based
on the assumption that the gold is at
least of standard quality, i.e., 11-12ths
pure. In the case of alluvial metal, it is
frequently higher, sometimes assaying
95 p.c. I have seen smelted gold that
subsequently assayed 95.4 p.c. and re-
torted metal that was barely 70 p.c. pure
gold.
The standard price is arrived at as
follows:
London price (for fine gold), say,
„oz £ 7 o 0
Plus exchange, 25 p.c 1 15 0
£8 15 0
Less l-12th 14 7
r 1, • • £BO5
Less p.c. commission (levied
in London, for handling
charges) roughly 2 0
r £7 18 5
Less deduction, usually between
Is. 9d. and 25., for bank’s own
profit i ii
Price per standard oz £7 16 6
(Australian.)
This explanation is offered in the in-
terests of the many small producers who
might consider that when the London
price is quoted at £7 per fine ounce
(equal to £8 15s. in Australian currency)
they are entitled to far more than
£7 16s. 6d. per standard ounce.
Copra-growing in the Solomons
“Solomonoo”: For some reason best
known to themselves, copra exporters
have always paid a much better price in
Mandated New Guinea than here in the
Solomons. Lately, however, one lifted
the price a couple of pounds per ton
to something nearer the M.T. offering.
Even this figure (£5 9s. per ton) falls
short of cost at port of export, but we
are thankful for small mercies, includ-
ing raised hopes.
The minimum labor wage is gazetted
to come down from 20s. and found to
10s. and found per month in December,
but it is very doubtful if this measure
is going to be a complete success. Some
of the larger and wealthier firms are
now recruiting hurriedly at a pound per
month in fear of reluctance on the part
of the natives to sign on after December
at 10s. They surely would do so if em-
ployers stood firm, but they may not see
the point of working and doing their best
beside the 20s. boy over nearly the whole
two-year period of indenture. Again, the
Chinese trader is certain to go on paying
the pound or more per month, and so
harvesting a little more cheap advertise-
ment at the expense of the white em-
ployer.
Crude as it may seem to the inexperi-
enced it looks as though we ought to
have followed the lead of the Mandated
Territory, and made the reduced wage a
maximum instead of a minimum one,
with reservatory powers in the hands of
the Resident Commissioner. The M.T.
maximum wage is said here. to be only
Bs. per month with “finding” inferior
to ours; and this, together with a very
much enhanced supply, gives the Terri-
tory a long start of us in the matter of
copra production.
tt Last week the mining-share market was
“dead as mutton,” to quote a Sydney
broker; the market is choked with scrip.
Some floats have not been handled
well, and the raising of necessary fresh
capital in such cases may be difficult.
But it will be a shame if shows of
promise are hindered from proceeding
with their job because greedy and short-
sighted speculators have sickened the
goose that hitherto has provided the
wherewithal.

Frank Wolff, the Sydney sharebroker,
in his November circular, expresses the
opinion that gold prices will remain high
for a number of years, and his agents in
London and New York “support the
view.” Further, “1935 should be the
best year from a market point of view,
as many cos. will be coming into pro-
duction and interest will be stimulated
by gold returns and dividends.”

“G.M.”: A Sydney man, supposed to
be above the average in financial acu-

had 200 sovereigns socked away since
1914, and they were now worth two
pounds each. I pointed out that at the
old savings-bank rate of compound in-
terest ' the 200 sovs. would have been
worth £4OO in 1932 had he put them in
the C.S.B. —a much safer place than the
backyard jam-tin. The hanging on to
vacant land is another gross blunder
made by people who will fight like tiger-
cats for threepence in a business deal.
People hold out for an extra profit of
five pounds on land deals and lose a
hundred in rates and property slumps all
the world over.

The American paper which announced
that “the U.S.A. rejoices over the worst
harvest for 50 years” finds a counterpart
in the Vic. Dried Fruits Association
whooping over the good news that the
world’s supply has slumped by 90,000
tons, and that Australia’s own crop is
down 10,000 tons. This may enable the

MR. JOHN MOORE and MISS SHIRLEY DALE, the popular Stage,
Screen and Radio Stars, both use and recommend HEENZO as a remedy
for coughs and colds.
CROUP—BRONCHITIS-
INFLUENZA
COSTS 21 SAVES £.’s
Here’s a recipe, given by a leading chemist, that will enable people to make the best
family cough remedy, and at the same time save much money. Everybody knows
that a good cough and influenza remedy consists of two mam sections:
The first section is the undiluted medicinal ingredients ; and the second is, of course,
the necessary water and sweetening. The preparation of the medicinal ingredients
requires trained knowledge, but the water and sweetening can be added in the
home just as easily as in the pharmacy. And you save a lot of money by doing
so Now, prove these facts by trying this HEENZO recipe: Into a jug put tour
tablespoonfuls of sugar, three of either treacle or honey two of vinegar, and a
large breakfastcupful of warm water. Stir til dissolved, and when the syrup
is quite cold pour into a large bottle, and then add a two-shilling bottle ot
concentrated HEENZO, obtained from your chemist or store. By doing this you
will have a family supply equal in quantity and superior in quality to eight
ordinary-size bottles of the best ready-mixed cough remedy that, if purchased in
the usual way, would cost up to £l. An outstanding feature about HEENZO s
the fact that it is a safe remedy for babies as well as adults, and over 12,000 people
have written letters proclaiming it the best remedy they have ever used for quickly
banishing coughs, colds, croup, bronchitis, and influenza.

HEAN’S TONIC NERVE NUTS
RESTORE HEALTH AND STRENGTH.
The day of the secret cure-all medicine
is rapidly passing, and leaders in the
pharmaceutical world realise that the
best method of earning the confidence
of an enlightened public is the
production of remedies that will bear
the investigation of leaders in analytical
research. This has long been realised
by the chemists responsible for the
success of Hean s Tonic Nerve Nuts.
When we say that money cannot buy a
better tonic for restoring the health of
people who are run-down, nervy,
neurotic, anaemic, or out of sorts, we
substantiate the claim by publishing the
formula of this popular tonic. Hean s
Tonic Nerve Nuts contain calcium,
glycerophosphate, carbonate of iron
extract, cascara sagrada, and capsicm.
They are compounded in tablet form,
and your own doctor will tell you what
an excellent formula this is for restoring
the health of people suffering from
ailments caused by exhausted nerves,
poorness of blood, overwork of worry.
Modern chemistry has proved the
advisability of preparing such remedies
in tablet form, for it solves the
problem of correct doses, and is more
convenient for taking and carrying by
users. Modern laboratory methods
have made it possible for Hean’s Tonic
Nerve Nuts to be sold to the public
at a reasonable price, for bottles
containing 12 days* supply cost only
3/-, and, in most cases, good health is
assured by the taking of two or three
bottles. In the treatment of long-stand-
ing ailments, the use of six bottles is
advised. Persons in need of a tonic
must realise that such a small outlay
of money for the restoration of their
health is indeed a wonderfully good
investment.
STOP
SMOKERS’ COUGH
Often smoking irritates the delicate membranes of the throat,
thus causing SMOKERS COUGH. This ailment is dangerous
when neglected, but all sources of danger can be removed by
occasionally placing in the mouth, between smokes, a
HEENZO COUGH DIAMOND, and letting it dissolve
slowly. By doing this you will soothe the throat, prevent
coughing, safeguard yourself against coughs and colds, and
remove the unpleasant smell of smoke from your breath. Money
cannot buy a better chest and throat JUBE, and they cost
only 1/- per tin. ALWAYS ASK FOR
Heenzo Cough Diamonds

NORTH OF
TWENTY-EIGHT
Flying in the North
The air is busy in the North. The first
flight on the new “via Cape York” route
from New Guinea has been made by
Pilot Marshall, who used the new land-
ing ground at Somerset. Cooktown and
Cairns are to be connected by Pilot
Macdonald, who did useful search work
after the recent hurricane. The big
Qantas D.H. 86’s will soon be on the
Darwin-Brisbane run, and the new Daly
Waters-Perth service has been inaugu-
rated without the South hearing much
about it. Arnhem Land Mines is re-
placing its Magic Carpet with a new
Tiger Moth, and almost every day sees
some private flier winging it from north
to south.
Development is not progressing with-
out accidents. One of the new Dragons
on the new north-west mail service came
to_ grief when the port engine cut out
15 feet' from the ground and the pilot
struck a stump in landing. The Dragons
are having a run of bad luck. They
are naturally safe machines —biplanes,
double-engined, 130 h.p. on each wing,
fitted to carry 10 people in motor-coach
comfort.
They have adjustable armchairs and
controlled temperature, and they can
keep aloft on one
engine and have a
long gliding range.
The N.T. accident
was something that
no safety factor
could provide for.
Six persons escaped
injury; but one of
them, a stockman
named Pite who
worked on
Buchanan’s pioneer
station, Flora Vale,
promptly got into a
light machine, which
crashed at the Ord River and killed him,
though the pilot escaped with a broken
arm.
These accidents in which somebody’s
number is up are rare, but they happen
sometimes. There are fliers whom Fate
regularly kills after a few tries, just as
there are others which it doesn’t seem
able to kill. One Queensland war pilot
came down hurriedly from 3000 feet,
stepped out of a tangle of matchwood
with scarcely a scratch, went up again
2000 feet and a few minutes afterwards
watched the remains burning while some-
body put plaster on his skinned nose.
Lawrence of Arabia has come through
three crashes, in each of which he should
have been pulp.
There was nearly another accident in
the N.T. to Miss Freda Thompson, the
Victorian girl pilot, who was on her way
from England. Conditions in the Terri-
tory at this time of year are difficult,
but the hardest thing of all for the inex-
perienced flier, and particularly the un-
trained navigator, is to pick up the Eva
Downs stock route, which leads across
the Barkly from Newcastle Waters.
Miss Thompson missed this and went
down the O.T. Line, where she was
found with her petrol exhausted 20 miles
north of the Tennant, which lies a couple
of degrees above Capricorn. A lot of
sensational nonsense has been written
about the risks of this area in the press
during the week —about the “stations
hundreds of miles apart” and the “fea-
tureless country.” Actually, the O.T.
line runs through a clearing a chain or
more wide. After leaving Newcastle
Waters, Lake Woods would tell the story
to a flier off his course. Unmistakable
landmarks like Powell’s Creek telegraph
station, Attack Creek, Renner Springs and
Banka Banka station flit by every few
minutes, and there is regular traffic up
and down from the Tennant. A local
inhabitant would roar with laughter at
the idea of coming to grief there on the
Line. But a newchum might.
The Barkly track is featureless and
dangerous for long stretches. It does not
occur to Canberra to stick a few easily
recognisable reflecting beacons across it
—a few dozen sheets of iron on a plat-
form or an iron hut stocked with emer-
gency stores every few dozen miles and
fitted with an automatic light would
serve the purpose and need little servic-
ing. Fliers with no navigation certifi-
cates are allowed to potter across this
uncharted deathtrap at will, and also
across the country west of the line where
Keith Anderson lost his life. It appar-
ently needs a major tragedy to spur the
Civil Aviation Department to action.
Tuckiar Goes Free
“Kaloa”: Tuckiar, of Caledon Bay, is
free. The High Court has found that the
jury was misdirected, because the Judge
called attention to the prisoner’s failure
to give evidence. A new trial is ruled out
because of the disclosure of an alleged
“Just like you men! Saved your own skins, but not one of you thought about
serviettes .”
admission of guilt by Tuckiar to his
counsel. The kernel of all the High
Court’s findings is in the remarks of
Starke, J., that “the trial was attended
by grave difficulties and was almost im-
possible. Tuckiar had no conception
of the standard of law and it's conse-
quences.”
However sound in inference Judge
Wells’s remarks were, they were not
legally valid. The Judge had failed to
make clear to the jury the dangers of
interpreting statements by aborigines
through other aborigines—which, of
course, a Darwin jury would understand
more clearly than a recently arrived
Judge—and did not point out the pos-
sible effect upon uncivilised aborigines
of a police party capturing their lubras
and trying to capture them as well.
English law (said Justice Starke) could
not be cited to justify the handcuffing of
these natives. So Tuckiar goes free, the
chief duty of the Darwin Judge con-
tinues to be the trial after trial of abo.
murderers, and in the outlands settlers
become less and less safe, while laws
framed by barristers out of experience
in city chambers continue to govern
people who understand only Stone Age
law and custom.
It would be easy enough to frame a
native code which would effectively pro-
tect lives and terrify the guilty—native
tribes have one themselves which is just
as rigid as our own. But not while the
administration of the Territory is in the
hands of coastal-farmer and suburbanite
Ministers, who have never seen a black-
fellow without his shirt on. Nothing
brings home the weaknesses of our laby-
rinthine legal system like a face-to-face
encounter with a naked and spear-armed
savage.
“Vic”: Can anybody tell me what is
the longest police patrol in Australia?
I nominate Wave Hill (N.T.), where the
distance is about 2000 miles, and water
is about as scarce as beer at the Pigeon
Holes. One trooper does the job.
❖ * * *
“Panyck”: When first cars came to
Central Queensland, the emus and kan-
garoos, both curious creatures, often
would run beside them for miles. Both
have jumped on car bonnets before now,
injuring cars and drivers ; but the most
hair-raising nature lesson the writer had
was near Marlborough (C.Q.). A
carpet-snake was thrown into the car by
a wheel, landing across the driver’s
shoulder. The brute promptly coiled up
and had to be manually loosened or the
driver throttled. The driver managed to
stop the car. I got out with snake’s head
in hand and pulled while driver pushed.
In the end carpo called it a day; he
was probably as frightened as we were.
“Australia Jane’s” Budget
Parmentier and Moll had a great reception
at Archerfield. Alderman Laurie represented the
Lord Mayor and James Blair, C.J., supported
him. A crowd of compatriots greeted the
aviators. There was an odd incident, quite
unrehearsed. It seems that when a Chevalier
is created part of the ceremony is the draping
of a small yellow flag bearing the photograph
and autograph of the Queen of the Nether-
lands on the shoulder of the hero. Parmentier
and Moll have yet to go through this cere-
mony officially, but an old Dutch sailor pushed
his way through the crowd and placed on
Parmentier’s shoulder the flag which he him-
self has cherished for years.
The two fliers were the guests of honor at
Lennon’s at night, and spent a lot of the
evening writing autographs.
Hugh Brandon, a Brisbane boy who did well
in the European musical world, is the conductor
of the Bach Society, which this week is present-
ing, for the first time in Brisbane, Purcell’s
opera “Dido and /Eneas.” Eunice Cochrane
is cast as Dido, and Nancy Muirhead and
Joyce Chapman are her attendants. The
scenery and stage settings were designed by
Vincent Brown.
So far 11 debs, have been listed to come out
at the United Charities Ball during the Duke’s
visit. They are Mary Hanlon, Elizabeth Mat-
year, Audrey Rosser (who hails from Port
Moresby), Phyllis Edwards, Heather Ashwin,
Olga Core, of Charters Towers (Mrs. A. E.
Moore is chaperoning her), Phyllis Littler (her
papa is A. E. Moore’s private secretary), Mar-
jorie Close, Dulcie Sampson (the young pianist)
and Elspeth Salkeld, daughter of the Public
Defender.
There was a good roll-up at the Brisbane
Women’s Club for the vocal recital by Lena
Hammond’s advanced pupils. Nancy Muirhead,
well known on concert platforms and over the
air, with Phyllis Dauth, sang a duet from
“Norma,” and was one of the trio in a
selection from “Faust.” One of the most
delightful items was Noel Johnson’s “Farewell
to Summer,” sung as a duet by Annie Bennett
and Evelyn English.
Commissioner for Taxation H. Magee soon
will have an empty nest. Following closely on
the announcement of son John’s engagement
comes the news that daughter Marie is engaged
to Jim Twyford, son of Mr. and Mrs. J. Twy-
ford, of Sydney.
Mrs. A. V. Dodwell and Mrs. R. W. Vaughan
are off to Pago Pago by the Mariposa for a
holiday. Mrs. Mervyn Dodwell, who owns a
picturesque house on the river-bank at New
Farm, brought out the best teacups to give a
group of friends the chance of wishing the
travellers good journey and safe return.
Mrs. Cumbrae Stewart has left for Melbourne
to attend the meetings of the Women’s Centen-
ary Council and the National Council of
Women —she is president of the Queensland
branch of the N.C.W. Mrs. J. Tait also is
heading for Melbourne for the Centenary Con-
vention, at which she will represent the
W.C.T.U.
Barbara Richardson, one of Toowoomba’s
prettiest girls, will marry in that city on
November 17 Jim Tonge, of Talwood. Lorna
Richardson will be bridesmaid,
and Mrs. Archie Taylor (once
Stephanie Munro, of Toowoomba)
is to be matron of honor.
In 1927 Miss Emilie Solomon,
over from South Africa, opened
Willard House, on North Quay,
for the W.C.T.U. The debt-
thanks to the women who, year
after year, have managed the re-
freshment booth at the show —
now has been wiped out. A party
celebrated the fact, and a number
of kindred associations sent along
representatives.
Mere males in the vicinity of
the Brisbane Women’s Club when
an “All-Australian” evening was
held must have gone away pon-
dering sadly, and thinking that
women’s clubs are much livelier
things than those run by the
sterner sex. Sounds of mirth
escaped from open doors and
windows. A bodyguard of
“gold-diggers,” complete with picks and
shovels, a “chain-gang” (these served supper,
incidentally), Australian songs, recitations from
Australian poets and the reading of Australian
stories helped to pass the evening. Short plays
were also on the programme.
Ragnhild Gashler and Claude Jennings have
chosen November 24 to have the knot tied at
St. John’s Cathedral. Gudrun Gashler will be
chief bridesmaid, and bridegroom’s sister Joyce
will help. There have been numerous parties
for Ragnhild.
Brisbane Austral Choir has promised a gala
performance of “The Messiah” during the
Duke’s visit, and Molly de Gunst has been
engaged for it.
The Western Division of the C.W.A. held its
eighth annual meeting, and State president Mrs.
Graham Mylne, who had been to Melbourne
to attend the Country Women’s Conference
there, sped straight out to Charleville for it.
Mrs. Graham Mylne can play the bagpipes
like a male Highlander. But it is not often
that she can be prevailed on to unleash them
in public.
F. F ; . Loxton, head serang of Burns, Philp
in Brisbane, has received word that son
Fred, who recently passed his Law Tripos at
Cambridge with second-class honors, has got
through his Bar examination with third-class
honors. Fred remains at Cambridge for a while.
Both he and his brother are useful men in
the sporting side of the University life —each
has won his blue.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
There’s no devil-may-care left in “Tip-
perary.” A packed Town Hall gave testi-
mony to that by its expression on Sun-
day night. The young were too young
to have ever caught the reckless swing
of it. The old have lost it —under a
mound of 16 red poppies. So when the
Grenadier Guards Band played the old
war tunes at the Festival of Re-
membrance they took on a solemnity
unbelievable to the leaf-brown soldiers
who sang them..
Highlights in the two hours’ ceremorvy
of hymn and patriotic song and poem
were the handing over of the baton
made from the wood of H.M.A.S. Syd-
ney to Major Miller, of the Grenadier
Guards Band, by a small blue-and-gold
stalwart of the Young Australia League ;
the reciting of Rod Quinn’s soldier-poem
“They Shall Come Home!” the speech
of Sir Philip Game, with whom came
Lady Game, the singing of “Roses of
Picardy,” the clarion notes of “Reces-
sional.” These led step by step to the
great moment when the “Last Post”
rang out, and the vast concourse with
one voice made the solemn vow: “We
will remember them!” And sixty-six
thousand poppy petals falling—a red
rain blown by a wind off Gallipoli, off
the Somme—drifted down from the Cross
of Sacrifice to seal the promise.
The sun shone hot on bearskin and
bare skin alike as the Grenadier Guards
Band marched into Sydney. The heat
proved too much for one old man, who
succumbed. One young thing in
diaphanous white in the waiting throngs
swooned, and was escorted a wraith be-
tween two stalwart blue policemen
across George-street. Still, old ladies
craned and flappers stood tiptoe and
strong men blew smoke-rings and traffic
police worked hard keeping a thorough-
fare clear for those few citizens who
really had to go about their affairs, and
couldn’t join the vast majority who
seemed to have nothing to do but stand
and gaze.
How hot the bandsmen looked in
their red coats, all-gilt' chest armor, their
furry turrets and their burning brass in-
struments! To slow drum beats the red-
and-gold of the visitors, the blue-and-
white of our own band, stepped down
Martin-place to the Cenotaph. Under a
burning blue sky “Roses of Picardy”
bloomed again ; “God Save the King”
clashed up to the gates of heaven. Un-
obtrusively-mannered and -voiced Major
Miller (there are no trumpet tones about
him) placed a wreath on the Cenotaph.
Up in the Town Hall, Town Clerk
Hendy (the Mayoral Parkers still being
in Melbourne) played host to the im-
ported and the home-grown bandsmen.
In the cool semi-darkness of the red-
curtained room, with its pictured be-
whiskered great, there was beer for those
who needed it. The starch came out of
discipline. Brows and necks were
mopped. The red-and-gold visitors
looked short beside the Royal Artillery’s
navy-and-white. But their cubic capacity
seemed about the same.
Mrs. Bassett and daughter Beaupre
surrounded beauty and genius with cock-
tails and Russian savories last Thursday
from five to seven. The result was one
of the happiest parties ever housed in
169 Macquarie-street. Beauty arrived in
navy and white, very slim and effective.
She was Jean Loton, of Perth, who was
one of the Duke’s first partners in Aus-
tralia. Genius was George Farrell, a
13-year-old violinist with a technique and
tone that brought showers of congratu-
lation on teacher Staell. The youngster
has bright blue eyes, black curling hair,
a pent brow and an unobtrusive manner.
Architect Hubert Woodhouse, who
speaks six languages, and tenor Charles
Nicis, who sings in five, handed around
the Russian foodstuffs in plain English.
Beaupre Bassett, in cosmos-pink chiffons,
looked effective, particularly when she
poised beside Jean Cheriton’s dove-greys.
Nora Cazabon was one of the flutter
of pretty creatures. Lute Drummond and
Alice Prowse were among the cogni-
scenti who listened to the song of the
bow.
Lorraine Henderson, the gold of whose
locks you can’t see in this drawing, has
just returned from a tour of Europe that
took in the byways as well as the high-
ways. Twelve months or more Lorraine
and her mother spent wandering about
countries separated from one another by
those strips of no man’s land called
boundaries. One important interlude was
her study in Germany with Carl Flesch,
for before everything else Lorraine is
a violinist —product of the best Queens-
land teachers and Sydney Con., where
Gerald Walenn guided her bow. Music-
lovers are already beginning to look for
this youngster’s name in radio pro-
grammes.
The Carnations sent out cards for a
party last week. The beauties came from
the best suburbs, in pink and red and
yellow raiment. Edie and Ethel and
Cynthia ; Mrs. Boyle, very. Carmenesque,
in red ; Bert Hinkler, a debonair button-
hole in primrose, lightly pink-edged ; and
hundreds of sisters and brothers from
the noblest families smiled greetings;
and then, regular cuckoos in the nest,
the lilies stole the show from them. Well,
maybe the Carnation Connoisseur was
not vamped ; but young husbands and
wives and beginning gardeners stood over
the bowls where miniature sisters of the
arum lily were grouped: deep wine-reds,
faded lilac, petunia and amber in tone.
The new species was brought to life at
Randwick racecourse by F. Douglas.
Poetess Nellie A. Evans, whose health
has been indifferent for the last year or
so, has been granted a small pension
from the Commonwealth Literary Fund.
The announcement brought quite a little
wave of rejoicing in the offices of at
least three newspapers in Sydney to
which Miss Evans for many years has
been a constant contributor.
Inter-State and Maoriland visitors need
not feel out of the swim during the royal
visit. They have a ball arranged speci-
ally for them by the Kindred Associa-
tions’ League, which embraces the South
and West Australian, the Queensland,
Maoriland, Victorian and Tasmanian
societies. The ball, which has the popu-
lar Mrs. Foster Mattei as secretary, and
the Walter Kingsmill lady and Mrs.
Hubert Fairfax as committee members,
promises to fill Hordern Brothers’ ball-
room with gaiety on November 23.
Nelle Grant-Cooper, the girl with the
happy smile in Angus and Robertson’s
bookshop, started to write a book of her
own a few months ago. The contents
are verses she had made up about the
animals and birds of Australia to amuse
nieces Lesley and Moira Pope. (Mrs.
C. J. Pope, of
Tres c o, is
Nelle’s sister.)
Under the title
“A u s t r alians
All! ” the gay
little rhymes
make happy
reading for
youngsters.
Dorothy Wall,
the girl with the
clever pencil
who lives in the
Blue Mountains
and has had a
book of her
own, “Bridget
and the Bees,”
lately published
in London by
Methuen, is re-
sponsible for the
merry illustra-
tions of “Aus-
tralians All!”
This Letter
spent the hour
previous to
Jean Batten’s
luncheon at An-
thony Horderns’
last Friday cast-
ing the glance
of discernment
over that firm’s
i n d i v i duality
frocks. They
proved that up
on Brickfield Hill
they are giving
a successful solu-
tion to the
woman battling with the problem of
finding the frock that expresses her-
self. The artistic one had her in-
tinct for the picturesque satisfied in
such raiment as a trained flowered chif-
fon frock, very bold in its floral design
and carrying its black taffeta shoulder
bands into long sash-ends. Roman
stripes made up into afternoon frocks of
the right temperament for the brunette.
The yachting girl would delight in the
cruise-blue linen, embroidered with white
anchors, and finished off with a deep
white pique cape collar moored in front
to two big blue buttons. The Junoesque
would feel proudly arrayed in the black
and silver tinsel crepe that got its effect
from the richness of its material and the
excellence of its cut —and that was all
on the cross.
A gallery of two thousand or so fol-
lowed the American and Australian
golfers around the links at the Lakes in
the teeth of Saturday’s wind. However,
all the homegrown prayers and bated
breaths didn’t prevent the Americans
from scooping up the cup they and their
wives had viewed at the Lakes Club
when they were lunched there last week.
The wives are as nice a group of women
as ever stepped off the Mariposa.
Though they play the game, they are
not fanatics. Pretty little Viola Dana,
whom we all loved on the silent screen,
came to our shores on the Mariposa with
husband James Thompson, another
American golfer of renown. Her clothes
will be worth a second glance, as proved
by her smart coming-ashore blacks, col-
lared in red and black taffeta.
Last week the Sydney tea-merchants’
profits went up with a bang. It was Cup
Week, and on the great day every
woman’s club flung wide its doors,
brewed jorum after jorum of Pekoe,
Penang, Darjeeling, Suchong and Bohea,
turned on the radio full blast and minis-
tered to the woman who stayed at home.
From Rose Bay to Watson’s, from Neu-
tral Bay to the Blue Mountains, the
voice of the announcer was more eagerly
listened for than the song of angels. It
was the one day of the year when the
drawing of sweeps becomes of more
absorbing interest than the daily world-
wide club amusement, the drawing of
conclusions.
Bridge was the anaesthetic that kept
the girls they left behind them quiet till
the great moment. In the Rose Bay
Club there was a regular epidemic of
card-tables. They broke out in the
dining-room as well as in the reception-
rooms and the verandahs with their
wide-flung views. The Forum Club was
very topical with horse-shoe savories and
beauteous with white and gold lilies and
rosy gladioli. The Women Pioneers
were very cosy in their Macquarie-street
fastness, and the Arts Club and the
Queen’s Club were the rendezvous of
other hundreds of the sex that mostly
bets two bob each way.
In their Darling Point home the
Rodney Dangars have a room gaily em-
blazoned with tropical fish. Why not
add a Cuproom with Peter Pans gallop-
ing around the wall to the ultimate re-
ward of a carrot? That is what Mrs.
Rodney put into the horse’s mouth after
his great victory, thereby providing an-
other bone for the two States to wrangle
over —should a N.S.W. or a Vic. green-
grocer have the honor to print above his
door: “Carrot Purveyor to His Royal
Highness, Peter Pan”?
The Highland Society put a dash of
color into an otherwise drab week and
turned up, pipes skirling and tartans
swinging, at Hordern’s ballroom to wel-
come the presidential J. R. Patricks. The
Captain and his lady are just back from
foreign parts, and to their glory the tall
drum-major added the impressiveness of
a leopard-skin flung across his shoulder.
Old Scots melodies throbbed through the
air, and created the right atmosphere for
a Highlander’s night out. Mrs. Patrick’s
frock was long, of black satin, and went
admirably with a diamente coronet. Mrs.
J. W. Kidd, whose husband was acting-
president, wore turquoise blues that drew
a sweep of train; blue chiffons patterned
in gold floated around Mrs. R. H. Snell-
ing; Mrs. H. C. Norton sported gold
lame sash-ends on her fern-green crepes.
A lot of the girls wore bracelets to
match their frocks.
The crush event of Saturday night was
the Cricketers’ Ball. Over a thousand
dancers screwed their way into David
Jones’s ballroom to applaud the
Premier’s speech of welcome. Yes, both
the Premier and Mrs. Stevens came to
the party, and she added lacquer-red
satins, the cape gold-sequinned, to the
night’s color scheme. The rainbow,
butterflies’ wings and a garden bed or
two had been looted for hues and shad-
ings thereof to make the frocks that glit-
tered and shone and glowed on the
crowded floor. Mrs. Heydon, whose
husband is secretary of the Cricket Asso-
ciation, was dignity in trailing black
taffetas splashed with diamente; Mrs.
Oldfield’s pink frock wore matching
frills on its shoulders. Numbered minia-
ture cricket bats were sold to help the
Industrial Blind Institute and the Bene-
volent Society, which share the profits
of the dance. The prize was a full-grown
cricket bat.

Chatter
Armistice Day of 1934 will live long
in Melbourne’s memory. The day’s great
event was the dedication by the Duke of
Gloucester of the Shrine of Remem-
brance, and a crowd such as the city has
seldom seen before, accustomed as it
is to vast assemblages, commenced to
arrive at dawn. At the appointed hour
it hemmed the memorial with a carpet of
humanity close on 300,000 strong.
The day was dull, and it seemed that
one of the most poetic features of the
ceremony would be absent —the illumina-
tion by the sun at the eleventh hour of
the eleventh day of the eleventh month
of the inscription in the inner shrine,
“Greater Love Hath No Man.” But
this was not lacking. The clouds broke
for a few minutes, and at the time of the
silence a golden beam flooded the tablet
and softly lit up the sanctuary.
Trumpeters and buglers, representing
many battalions, stood on the steps of the
shrine at the commencement of the cere-
mony, to be joined a little later by 22
color parties, carrying King’s Colors
awarded to Australian forces. Khaki-
clad Australian soldiers and blue-clad
sailors from the Australian Navy lined
the approach. In the cortege that
advanced upon the memorial were the
Duke, in the khaki service uniform of a
*major of the 10th Hussars, and Lord
Huntingfield, Premier Argyle, General
Chauvel and President Dyett, of the
R.S.L., also in service kit. Massed bands
played Handel’s stateliest largo, and led
the singing of great hymns. The Duke
took into the shrine a tribute from the
King, a wreath of poppies framed in
laurel. This he laid reverently upon the
Rock of Remembrance amid the thunder
of guns and the whir of aeroplanes
swooping overhead. His voice, in his
brief speech, shook slightly, for he
shared the emotion that stirred the huge
assemblage.
At the two minutes’ silence th§ flags
of Melbourne came slowly down to half-
mast. The buglers sounded “Last Post”
and “Reveille,” and at the end came a
fine imaginative touch. From the upper
parts of the shrine was released a vast
flock of pigeons. The birds wheeled
around the fane a few times and then
headed in various directions for their
homes.
Kipling’s Ode also graced the proceed-
ings, read very impressively by Premier
Argyle. A sonorous poem, one couplet
of which seemed to make special appeal:
And gave their name for ever to a beach
Which shall outlive Troy’s tale when Time is
old.
The Bard of Empire could be depended
upon not to forget Anzac Cove.
Among centenary visitors are Sir
Maurice Hankey and his lady, whose
portrait by Broothorn is sandwiched here.
Sir Maurice is secretary of the Com-
mittee of Imperial Defence. Lady Han-
key is a daughter of A. de Smidt, one-
time Surveyor-General of Cape Colony.
During the ceremony of the dedication
of the Shrine one of the radio an-
nouncers, while “filling in,” referred to
the picture “Menin Gate,” its symbolical
message and “its creator, Sir John Long-
staff.” The one thing in the world which
makes that artist really angry is being
credited with the works of his cousin
Will, so if there is murder at a radio
station in the near future the C.I.D. will
have a clue.
The 1934 Melbourne Cup won’t be
easily forgotten. Some people didn’t
even get out of their cars, but made for
town and the results per radio. Damp,
dispirited crowds, collars up and tails
down, tramped for home before the*
Cup race ; others kept comparatively dry
under odd bits of shelter, but they didn’t
see as much as a horse’s ear the whole
afternoon. Members got off lightly—
they only had to splash through water on
cement —but non-members felt the lawns
become a black, sticky mess, the sort of
mud that makes a soggy sound when
a foot and ankle are drawn from its
depths. Wide summer hats flapped
miserably over damp faces as their dye
mingled with cosmetics. One woman
discovered that all the color in feathers
doesn’t belong to birds. She turned her
head sideways, leaving the purple mark
of her quill upon the noses of hundreds
of men who clawed their way past her
into the bar. Dresses shrank in the
deluge, to display inches of petticoat or
leg, and when the sun suddenly appeared
after four it was so hot that tender skins
soon collected a beetroot flush.
The crowd was not peeved at having
cheered an empty carriage on the Duke’s
arrival, but deserted the Cup champions
entering the mounting paddock to pursue
H.R.H. on his tour of inspection. When
he entered the v.-r. box Mrs. Beaumont
Pease was introduced and sat between
him and Lord Huntingfield. She wore a
squashy beret, navy coat and long navy-
blue kid gloves. Mrs. Rodney Dangar
was all in black with a spray of lily-of-
the-valley, and Peter Pan, whose bridle
she held, had his tail bound up in the
most fashionable wet-day manner. Some
wise people brought out two hats; the
little unimportant ones disappearing late
in the afternoon in favor of fragile
models brought from cars. Large white
hats were worn by the Anderson lady
and her daughter Hermione, Mrs. Geoff
Grimwade and Mrs. Jim Cumming. Mrs.
Fred Haig was more wintry with a silver
fox and smaller millinery. Mrs. Herbert
Field’s quilted tarn went with gardenias
and a black dress, its piquancy lying in
the sleeves.
Rubber capes, knee- and waist-length,
were the most interesting garments worn
at the Oaks. There were droves of white
raincoats (Melbourne shops have un-
loaded their complete stocks) and red,
blue and speckled umbrellas. Mrs.
Deryck Mollison wore a brown straw
beret stabbed with straw buttons.
Summer and winter were mixed by Mrs.
Keith Tolhurst with a pink dress and
a brown cloth coat, and by Mrs. Charles
Osborne with a beige coat and black
tulle headcovering. Mrs Gordon Har-
rison capped her pinky-beige suit with
brown velvet, and Mrs. Ronald Cumming
cheered her subdued navy flecked dress
with a white summery hat. The Ray
Connellys were there, receiving congratu-
lations upon their political success.
Isobel Crosbie wore a brown fox with
a black frock, and Mrs. Kingsley Daw-
born’s black coat perked up with the aid
of a green hat.
The first ball for four years to be
held in G.H. ballroom was given for
the Duke of Gloucester. For most of its
functions of decades ago the ballroom
was unadorned, but it was florally fes-
tive for last week’s grand occasion. The
Botanical Gardens provided blooms of
all species and colors for valentine fes-
toons round the walls, the pendant part
of each decoration being held secure by
lattice frameworks. H.R.H. stood within
a pen of rope near the blue velvet canopy
whence the debs, were brought to re-
ceive a royal handshake. Supper was
served in the supper-room, snacks were
continuous fixtures in the buffet annexe
and thirst-quenchers from champagne to
fruit-cup were procurable under canvas
on the lawn. Raised seats in the ball-
room, chairs on the verandah and the
early-Victorian furniture of the drawing-
room were used for sitting out between
dances.
The Lion. Sara Vanneck, the Duke’s
first partner, was conspicuous in gold
lame with a dragon train. Sir lan Fraser
came with his lady, whose orchid-blue
gown was glazed with dull gold and
silver. Mrs. Alec Russell was shimmery
in dull-surfaced crepe of peach-bloom
toning. Annette Powell held her debu-
tante posy of rosebuds and lily-of-the-
valley among the tulle petals which flut-
tered on her wispy white cape. Looking
like love-in-the-mist was Rosemary
Downes, in pale-blue tulle. Two pre-
lates in gorgeous purple were swept up
among the glitter of uniforms.
There was plenty of time to admire
the decorations at the Lord Mayor’s
Ball, for but for a few couples who
twirled at one end of the room there
was no dancing until after royalty ar-
rived at 10 p.m. On his entry the Duke’s
attention was attracted by lyrebird
calls —the clever imitations were given
by a “swaggie” from the forest on
the stage. It was a moonlit glade
filled with eerie shadows, tall, dark
trees and thick undergrowth, through
which a creek burbled. The gallery, too,
was woody, gum saplings reaching right
to the roof. Golden lights were wedged
among the roots of ferns and bushes,
and there was a jungle where the band
was heard but barely seen. Gengoult
Smith’s lady was the Duke’s first partner,
and afterwards he danced with the Hon.
Sara Vanneck, Mrs. J. W. Seamour,
Helen Hughes and Helene Best. . The
Littleton Groom lady wore tomato chif-
fon with deep-cream shoulder panels
sweeping backwards into skirt drapery.
The British representative at Canberra
brought Mrs. Crutchley, whose dress
was of floral chiffon. The Sowden lady’s
shoulders disappeared among the white
ospreys which blew upon her white satin
gown. Alderman Stapley escorted his
wife, who wore a black gown flecked
with gold. Mrs. Eric Hill was in shell-
pink, Mrs. Bracegirdle wore blue and
Mrs. S. W. Gullett moss-green lace with
a mesh of cape. Among the young things
were Betty Marron, whose Titian locks
looked well with primrose, and Freda
Connolly, in swirls of white tulle.
The Services wore uniforms; nearly
every man had a glitter of decorations
across his chest, and the aldermen dis-
played the shape of their calves in knee
breeches. They also had buckled shoes
and giddy whirls of lace under their
chins. (After the royal departure the
Lud Mayor changed his regalia and
appeared much happier in “tails”)
Supper was served to the popping of
corks —upstairs, in the lower regions
and in the lower Town Hall, where the
table of honor was spread with a dozen
goldfish-painted mats, and where ferns
growing from nests of monkey-musk
gave an umbrella-like shelter to each of
the smaller tables.
This is an Athol Shmith portrait of
Mrs. W. J. Seymour, one of the hostesses
at the Matrons’ Ball in St. Kilda Town
Hall Before her marriage Mrs. Seymour
was Wilma Clarke, daughter of the late
W. J. T. Clarke. Her mother, who is
very well-known among the older genera-
tion, lives in St. George’s-road, Toorak.
The wind remembered what it had
done a few months ago at the royal
garden party on the other side of the
world and tried the same tricks at Mel-
bourne’s G.H. garden party. It took a
mean advantage, for it grabbed people’s
hats while their shoes were stuck fast
in the mud of the squelchy lawns. After
seeing what the elements did at the Cup
Lady Huntingfield took no risks, but
hung an umbrella to her wrist as she
walked about in mist-grey lace. The
queue of formidable length was dis-
banded before four, the host and hostess
preferring to move among the scattered
remnants in an unofficial manner before
piloting the Duke towards a cup of tea.
A wearer of one of the few flowing
chiffon gowns completely ruined her sug-
gestion of shoes —two narrow white straps
attached to each sole and spindle heel.
Cecil McKay brought his wife, whose
pink gloves and large pink hat were a
spring-like concession with a caped
black coat. General Coxen accompanied
his wife and daughters Marnie and
Dorothy, a trio in dark coats over light
frocks. Nell Healy, just engaged to
Vivian Wilshire, wore seven-eighths of
ice-blue coat over navy. Vera Sheedy
watched proceedings between a large
dark-blue hat and a pink pierette ruffle
round her neck. Aviator Jimmy Melrose
was not at all out of countenance at the
shine of belltoppers and the neatness of
spats. He wore slacks with a green-and-
white check coat.
On Saturday the royal standard was
flown for the first time at Laver ton air
station, when the Duke discovered what
a traffic jamb feels like. Though he
missed most of the flying, H.R.H. was
on time for his scheduled presentation of
the air-race prizes. He shook hands with
each competitor who was present, but
made no speech. He refused tea, and as
it was impossible to get him citywards
per road (cars were still struggling four
deep along the Geelong-road) a special
train was ordered. The organisers of the
pageant had no idea that the display
would draw such an enormous crowd.
Among the flying stunts were a demon-
stration by an autogyro, air drill by
squadrons which formed an H on the
Duke’s approach, bombing a dummy ship,
a game of skittles and an engineless
’plane, which after its towrope to a Bull-
dog was cut looped the loop to make a
perfect landing. Mrs. Williams, wife of
the Air-Commodore, wore a black coat
with monkey fur upon the cape and
sleeves and water-lilies upon the lapel.
Others in the vicinity were Air-Commo-
dore and Mrs. Goble, Macpherson
Robertson with his lady (her chocolate-
brown coat had a fox collar) and young
grandson, George Pearce and his lady
(who had a bunch of white camellias upon
her small black hat) and Mrs. Bonney.
Mrs. Bonney was the first to congratulate
Mrs. Melrose, who received a medallion
as the owner of the ’plane flown by her
son. The destination of the beautiful
gold cup which Scott held under his
arm is Grosvenor House, London.
Afterwards there was an official tea in
the officers’ mess. Scott and Black
carved the first piece of bullock at the
barbecue, but owing to the odor of 27
bullocks, a wombat and a kangaroo they
did not stay long. But thousands did,
who, armed with their own knives and
forks or using just fingers, washed down
their open-air meal with beer.

VICTORIAN
AND
MELBOURNE
CENTENARY
By the time the Australian Club Ball
appeared on the horizon Melbourne had
to prop its eyelids open, for it had been a
hectic week crammed with too many
meals and drinks and no time for sleep.
The Australian Club gives few balls, but
this achievement did not evince lack of
practice. A bathroom-tap and garden-
hose were so masked and dominoed and
heaped with flowers that no one thought
about the origin of the bubbling foun-
tain which splashed on a landing among
tree-ferns and water-lilies. The Duke
danced with Marjorie Wilson, daughter
of Queensland’s Governor. She wore
cream satin and a twinkly-silver halo in
her hair. Also in creamy shades were
Mrs. D. H. Sargood and Nancy Fan-
court. Mrs. Robert Brodie was pursued
by a wispy train of turquoise, and Mrs.
Harold Darling’s black gown was
attached to a necklet of heavy gold links.
The Norman Brookeses’ dance must be
classed as one of the most expensive
private functions ever staged in Mel-
bourne. Champagne was still flowing at
3 a.m. when eggs and bacon came on
the scene. Among all the usual supper
delicacies in and out of season were a
whole turkey (and sharp knives in case
anyone preferred to carve his or her own
portion) and four complete salmon, each
a yard long. Every visible member of
the staff, permanent and temporary, had
white gloves. Dancing was upon a floor
built over the tennis court (it was never
too crowded, there being such tremen-
dous traffic to and from the buffet) and
sheltered by a marquee with a specially
planted garden border running around
the inside of the canvas walls. A rustic
bridge from the “drawing-room” part of
the marquee led to a floodlit miniature
English garden (grown in a night). The
Navy glittered with gold braid, but the
Army and the Air Force wore “tails and
miniatures.” H.R.H. came to supper
after “Blue Mountain Melody.” Madge
Elliott and Cyril Ritchard were among
the late arrivals. They had been intro-
duced to the Duke during an interval
at His Majesty’s.
After several changes of plans the
Duke did visit Mawallok, so Mr. and
Mrs. Alec Russell were not disappointed
over all the special preparations they had
made to shelter royalty.
The Matrons’ Ball was a very brilliant
social fixture. There were lovely gowns
and real jewels ; at supper roses glowed
upon the tables and on the walls, silk
hangings swayed from the balconies, while
overhead cypress-trees and festoons of
gilded leaves climbed among twinkling
lights. The Duke, who had dined at the
Melbourne Club, arrived to a peal of
trumpets and roll of drums. Mrs. J. V.
Fairbairn’s opalescent-white satin gown
was touched by the royal arm during the
first dance. Among other partners were
Mrs. C. O. Fairbairn and Mrs. John
Ritchie. Mrs. John Fitts was in white
with silver sprays of flowers. Mrs.
Otway Falkiner’s white gown had a gold
suggestion through its weave. Mrs T. C.
Manifold’s and Mrs. Dermot Casey’s
sweeping draperies were of deep-cream
satin. Mrs. Harry Whiting’s dress was a
bubble of white tulle, and Sheila Mac-
Donald’s a glitter of gold sprayed with
green leaves.
For one afternoon the Sussex flew a
skull-and-crossbones, having surrendered
to a nest of pirates. All the “Treasure
Island” people were to be seen. There
were large, hairy Spanish pirates with
rings in their ears and knives in their
mouths and small, yellow Chinese pirates
with pigtails—cheerful fellows who per-
formed their kidnapping by carrying
their young prizes up the gangway. They
knew the most direct routes to slides,
swings, coal-baskets worked by pulleys
and dens or caves where lemonade,
chocolates and balloons were stored as
loot. It was a splendid afternoon for
the children invited, and the most unique
party given by any of the visiting war-
ships.
Trailing garments were definitely not
done at the Parliamentary garden party.
Women got tired of chasing elusive
summer, and sidestepped back into
tweeds, furs and small hats. But for
the Navy, which was in uniform, and
Jimmy Melrose, with an uncovered head,
the men present were divided among
silk hats and bowlers. A Flanders poppy
bloomed in every buttonhole. Arrivals
in Queen’s Hall were directed onwards
towards the garden, but tea could be ob-
tained in the main dining-room as well
as in several marquees. Stanley Argyle
walked beside H.R.H. on a tour of the
grounds. Captain Barbour, in much
scarlet and gold braid, was the only re-
splendent person in the royal procession.
The Duke’s table was spread within
arm’s-length of an enormous basket of
rhododendrons under a white canopy on
a small verandah of Parliament House.
Mrs. Russell Clarke wore a navy coat
and a hat of a more delicate shade of
blue. Air-Commodore Goble’s wife
chose a suit of misty-blue woollen crepe.
Speaker Everard’s wife was in a flowered
dress protected by a black coat.
Melbourne’s illuminations continue to
excite admiration. The Carlton Brewery-
has hit on the idea of coloring its steam
(or smoke), so that a fiery cloud which
changes occasionally to blue or green
hangs over its towers. The Brigade build-
ing has also chosen clouds for its decora-
tion. A rosy glow is reflected from the
inside of the Manchester Unity’s towers,
and the C.T.A. helps to make Flinders-
street festive. The Electricity Commis-
sion building wears a column of neon
lights running up and down its tall face,
and among its upper storeys are layers
of graduated color achieved through re-
flections on jutting ledges of the building.
Elizabeth, the fair-haired elder
daughter of Richard Stawell and his
lady, has given her promise to Peter, son
of the knightly Robert Garrans, of Can-
berra.
THE LITTLE SISTERS.
SOUTH AUSTRALIA.
The French sloop Amiral Charner
has departed, and L’Alliance Fran?aise
is recovering its breath. The at-home
given by Captain Adelus and his officers
on the ship at Birkenhead made a fit-
ting finale. Champagne flowed like
water. Great magnums were repeatedly
opened, and, as there was a shortage of
champagne-glasses, guests were given
butcher-glasses that were replenished by
stewards as soon as they were empty.
The effervescent afternoon started at 3.30
and did not finish until 8 p.m. French
Consul Moulden was there, and there
was dancing.
Adelaide has now had its turn with
floods. A garden fete and sale of dis-
abled soldiers’ handicraft were to have
been held in the grounds of Mrs. H. C.
Downer’s home at Walkerville, but a
storm burst in the morning and turned
the copse where once a garden smiled
into a lagoon, so the whole affair had to
be postponed at the last moment. That
day ’phones were ringing furiously all
the morning, many men being recalled
from their offices to return with a boat
and salvage their family. In one suburb
many maidens donned bathing costumes
and lent a hand getting things out of
friends’ flooded bungalows.
Prof, and Mrs. A. E. V. Richardson
entertained 25 blind folk from the R. 1.8.
at Urrbrae for an afternoon. Each
guest was escorted by a friend, and, after
being received, was taken to a huge
bower of roses, where an orchestra
played. Mrs. Richardson related the
story of Urrbrae, and Mrs. Reeves re-
cited. Afternoon-tea was served in the
underground ballroom, and the Prof,
gave a chat on the Waite Research
Institute and what it means to the State.
Then tea was dispensed by Mrs. Richard-
son and her sister, Mrs. Wells, and
friends.
WESTRALIA.
The touring English schoolgirls made
a welter of sightseeing and entertain-
ments during their stay in Perth. The
Pleiades Club was early in the field with
a morning-tea in the larkspur- and gorse-
decked lounge. President Florence Arm-
strong, radiating cheer in tomato wool
crepe, welcomed chaperon Miss Thomas
and her 25 charges. Joan Fry played
the piano. Zoe Bennett, her blonde
curls escaping from a black-and-white
beaded turban, spoke on architecture,
and after the snack there was a climb
to the roof-garden to see the panoramic
view of the city and the Swan.
The C. F. MacLarens put on a dance
at the Rex, Carlton, to welcome
daughter Isla on her return from Eng-
land. Skilfully cut orchid armure was
swathed around Mrs. MacLaren’s lissome
lines, and Isla’s oyster satin was heavily
encrusted with beads. Margaret Brisbane
threaded her way through the palms with
a shower of frills of lettuce-green
chiffon ; Thelma Rose girdled her white
hand-drawn French voile with apple-
blossom velvet; Helen Dobson was a
symphony in pastel pinks and blues ; and
Gladys Miller swished tiers of floral
taffetas.
Elsie Rutherford trekked up the arum-
lilied aisle of St. Mary’s, West Perth, to
meet Reg Hazlehurst at the altar. Her
dainty Swiss georgette and Chantilly
lace cascaded on the ground under a
foam of lace-embossed tulle which
screened her sheaf of pink-tipped gladi-
oli. Little Marjorie Kitley carried the
train in early-Victorian white taffeta, and
the bride’s sister, Mrs. V. Creek, and
Jean Appleby brought up the rear, their
peach-pink chiffons sashed with green
and topped with rose-trimmed green
ballibuntals. Toasts were honored at the
Karrakatta Club, where Mrs. Ruther-
ford’s golden roses were held against
gold-embroidered black georgette.
Maurice le Courtoir directed the pre-
sentation of Ibsen’s “Rosmersholm” at
the Little Theatre. Phyllis Harnett and
James Quinn bore the brunt of the work
as Rebecca and Rosmer, and Howard
Bagnall, James Crawford, Lawrence
Hunter and Gay McNeil filled the minor
roles.
The Women’s Service Guild hall was
canopied with blue and pink streamers
for the annual bazaar, and the well-laden
stalls were gay with rainbow trappings.
Mrs. Cardell-Oliver, clutching presenta-
tion roses, opened proceedings, and
directed attention to the photographs
demonstrating the struggle for woman-
hood suffrage. There was a musical pro-
gramme and a continuous serving of
tea, with its side-issue of cup-reading
and palmistry.
Members of the Women Writers’ Club
welcomed ex-secretary Jessie Macgregor
with a dinner at the Karrakatta Club.
President Dolly Ferguson, set about with
black lace, made the greetings with vice-
pres. Mrs. A. E. Joyner, whose black
velvets were flecked with gold lame.
The guest of honor’s black French laces
were admired as she gave a vivid account
of her travels through Europe.
Gwenyth Tebbutt is doing a breathless
round of bride-elect and farewell parties,
as after her marriage to John Hicks the
couple leave for England. Perth College
O.G.A. poured tea at the Pleiades Club ;
Lorna Booth and Peggy James invited
folk to the Repertory Club; Mavis
Bettesworth was another hostess, and
Phyllis Barry brewed tea at her home in
Guildford.
Dorothy Summerhayes has promised
her heart and hand to Francis L. Hen-
stock, of Ceylon. Wedding bells will
ring early in the New Year.
TASMANIA.
To raise the wind so that some of the
Speck’s Boy Scouts might attend the jam-
boree in Melbourne, Lady Clark arranged
a big bridge party at Government House.
The ballroom was set out with 65 tables,
all of which were filled. Decorations of
mauve, blue and purple irises made a
lovely display. Her Ladyship received
everybody, and then had to go on to
open a fair.
The Engineers’ dance in the Library
Hall at the Uni. was a cheery affair, and
dancing was interspersed with stunts and
experiments in the electricity, science
and physics rooms. Green and gold
streamers and balloons of all shades
made the decorations.
The Tamar was alive with craft at the
combined opening day of the T.R.C. and
T.Y.C., and both clubs showed a good
roll-up of members. J. E. Heritage and
R. M. Collins made speeches, and the
T.R.C. turned many honest pennies by
running a fair in the boathouse on the
same day.
Our old Theatre Royal has been cele-
brating its 100th year of existence, and
all sorts of reminiscent articles have
appeared in the papers describing its ups
and downs. Eminent stars have shone
in it, and world-wide celebrities have
testified to its wonderful acoustics. It
has become a feature of Old Hobart, and
one of which we are sentimentally fond.
The visiting English bellringers have
been making music wherever they go,
and old Trinity tower rocked under
their performance of a peal with over
5,000 changes. Vice-regal and Mayoral
receptions were held for the visitors’ en-
tertainment.
Thirty-two years of absence from the
Speck have done nothing to lessen the
warm regard felt by Hobart’s older mem-
bers of society for Lady Montgomery,
widow of one of our best-loved bishops.
She has been renewing old acquaintances
on all sides at lunches and tea-parties.
The Collegiate School, which she worked
to establish, had a gratifying expansion
to show her after all these years.
Beryl, youngest daughter of Mr. and
Mrs. C. P. Andrews, and Matthew
Brodie, of Smithton, were married at St.
Aidan’s, Launceston,. the bride wearing
a deep-sapphire lace frock with a straw
picture-hat bearing a touch of pink under
the brim. Sister Vera ’maided in beige
georgette and lace and a hat with shaded
brown flowers.

SUNDRY
SHOWS
Imperfect Sympathies.
I’m sorry, but I own when / am told
How high some Yankee has piled up
the gold,
How many million toilet-rolls he’s sold,
The story leaves me cold.
How many travellers, primed with smutty
tales,
Report how many hundred thousand
bales
Are entered on their sacred lists of sales,
My spirit droops and fails.
How they are trained and drilled in pep
and zip,
And how to cram the samples in the
grip,
And witch the world with noble sales-
manship,
I fairly get the pip.
And how they go to universities
And are awarded honors and degrees
For excellence in little arts like these —
I suffer agonies.
But when the man, as crooked as he’s
tough,
Whose dollars breed by trickery and
bluff,
Talks to the world of uplift and such
stuff,
By God, I’ve had enough!

Tributes to
Bad Art
I hate grand
opera. My objec-
tion is largely
pure prejudice
and ignorance. I
dislike the tunes
—or, as it appears to me, the lack of
tunes. There are certainly some tunes
in grand operas, but very few —gener-
ally one or two at the most. My feel-
ing is that the Composers’ Union insists
on a limitation of output, and that any
composer who puts more than two tunes
into an opera is liable to be declared
bogus, expelled from the union and have
his award cancelled. I am told that if
I knew more about music I would be
able to discern tunes where they don’t
exist to the uninitiated ear. That is pos-
sibly true. I admit everything, and am
willing to put my confession in writing
and sign it.
But my greatest objection to grand
opera is not a personal matter. It stands
on much firmer ground, being a matter
of fact, not taste. It is that grand opera
is bad art —art as bad as placing a Moor-
ish arch on two Doric columns or sculp-
ing a pair of scanties on the Venus de
Medici. It purports to represent action,
which may be swift or violent, by a
medium which is necessarily slow; it
purports to present emotions and senti-
ments by a succession or combination
of sounds —sentiments which are not
presentable in any medium, and about
which psychoanalysts have written vast
volumes in which they contradict one
another.
Is it possible to conjure up anything
more ridiculous than a love scene or a
murder or a grief scene from a grand
opera?
Basso: You dog, you dog, you dog; I’ll
cut your throat.
Tenor: My throat, my throat.
Basso: Your throat, your throat.
Together: My throat, your throat.
Soprano (bursting in): Don’t cut; don’t
cut; don’t cut his throat.
Together: My throat, his throat, his
throat.
And so on for five minutes. Then the
basso cuts his throat and the tenor dies,
singing his way to eternity with occa-
sional interruptions in harmony from the
soprano. The grief of the soprano over
his body, the exultation of the basso to
the chorus when it slowly filters in, the
half-hearted rebuke to the homicide
from the assembled choristers in song —
the whole is comparable only with the
Marx brothers in their less sober
moments.
Yet this is taken seriously by the
crowds which gather to worship at the
shrine of grand opera. I saw women
actually crying when Butterfly weeps
over the body of her infant in B flat or
G minor, or whatever it is. I noticed
people shuddering when Tosca eviscer-
ates the unspeakable Scarpia ; the same
people who would snort in a superior
way at an infinitely more convincing
scene in an Edgar Wallace melodrama.
Butterfly, by the way, contains a couple
of typical, grand-opera lines when one
Yank sings:
Will you have a whisky.
And the other replies:
Yes, with a little soda-water in it.
Wagner had the right idea when he
wrote his musical plays—he refused to
admit them as operas. His music is in-
tended to be merely an atmosphere for
the emotions of the characters. His leit-
motifs were utilised simply to make this
atmosphere more manifest. He raised to
the highest degree the principle followed
when “burglar music” is played in thrill-
some parts of melodrama. The pity of
it is that movies were not invented before
Wagner wrote. I saw the Valkyries in
London. The famous ride was depicted
by eight middle-aged, stout ladies stand-
ing in a row with toasting forks, singing.
A movie show would present the music
to a picture of 500 athletic Amazons gal-
loping down a mountainside and picking
up the dead warriors from the battle-
field.
The objections I raise to grand opera
are, of course, equally applicable to

work at the Macleod Gallery, Sydney.

taken seriously. Grand opera is, and by

Grainger’s
Broadcasts
The Sydney
dailies, which
habitually devote
columns of adu-
lation to the per-
formances of
pianists with names ending in “isky” or
“vitchski” or “offski,” had no space to
spare for Percy Grainger’s broadcast re-
citals after the first, though these con-
stituted quite the most important musical
event in Australia for a decade.
The series has covered, as well as out-
standing examples from the older clas-
sics, almost every significant contribution
to pianistic literature in the present cen-
tury, each accompanied by a short oral
commentary and analysis. It has been
such a course of instruction in apprecia-
tion as couldn’t be matched in any con-
servatorium in the world, for Grainger
is the acknowledged high priest of many
of the moderns, and his interpretations
are authoritative. Moreover, he doesn’t
have a “repertoire,” but takes all musfc
as his field, from Bach to Bartok, and
is not too high and mighty to play tech-
nically easy stuff if the music appeals
to him.
Incidentally, he has been having a go
at the Australian composers—not a very
impressive band yet, it must be confessed
—and included some of their pieces in
his recitals.
A. MAJOR.
Moore’s Story
of Our Art
“The Story of
Australian Art,”
by William
Moore (Angus
and Robertson;
505.), is a pains-
taking compilation which contains infor-
mation concerning, almost every painter,
sculptor, etcher and black-and-white
artist who had or has anything to do
with Australia. Copiously illustrated,
well indexed and winding up with a
series of thumbnail biographies, the
two volumes are worthy of a place in
every Australian reference library.
But the mass of facts and anecdotes
which has been so industriously accumu-
lated doesn’t make a story—it makes
only a catalogue. There is virtually no
criticism; no attempt to assess relative
values, and hence no perspective. Abso-
lute impartiality isn’t a virtue in a his-
torian ; it can be practised only by abdi-
cating the right to have a standpoint.
Without a standpoint for the narrator
the facts recounted lack significance.
It is possible, however, in some cases,
for the reader to make some deductions
for himself. One of Norman Lindsay’s
first paid jobs, Mr. Moore says, was the
production of 100 illuminated
school texts at 2s. 6d. apiece. After that
ordeal it isn’t difficult to understand a
predilection for Rabelais and Boccaccio.

The loan ex-
hibition of “con-
temporary British
art” at Sydney
National Gallery
fills the walls of
two large rooms, and isn’t confined
to contemporary painters or to Brit-
ish artists. It is representative in the
sense that it contains examples of
almost every style and school, and a
catholic taste and a lack of sectarian
prejudice are essential to its enjoyment.
The way Whistler threw his pots of paint
at the public is indicated in “Nocturne:
Bleu et Vert” and “Valparaiso—Morn-
ing after the Revolution,” and they both
look so pleasant and conventional that
it becomes a wonder why Ruskin got
so hot and bitter about such work.
There are canvases by Pissaro, Sickert,
Ethel Walker and Duncan Grant which,
if Jimmy had seen them, would have
left him staggered at his own modera-
tion. Augustus John’s “Duchesse de
Grammont” and “Yvonne” serve to ex-
plain his vogue as a portraitist—both
carry tons of vigor. Most ordinary folk
will stand longest before the Orpens—
particularly “A Bloomsbury Family” and
“In the Studio,” in which almost every
clever trick in the modern painter’s reper-
toire is exemplified. The family glimpse
would be a great classic if it hung to-
gether just a little better. James Pryde’s
“Red Bed” is a fine example of melo-
dramaticism in oils; and the four Sar-
gents, two in oils and two in water-
color, though not very impressive
examples of this painter’s art, show his
mastery of broad impressionism was
based on splendid draughtsmanship.
Etching presents the extraordinary
anomaly of being a medium by which
Hideous eyesores which call for muni-
cipal action are turned into the pic-
turesque adornments of a library wall,
and William Hunter, at Everyman’s Gal-
lery (Melbourne), performs this miracu-
ous service for the despised reaches of
Footscray, Williamstown and the mouth
of the Yarra. His water-colors venture
on the same forbidden ground occasion-
ally, and he has made Fisherman’s Bend,
an unholy stretch between Port Mel-
bourne and Williamstown, a picture
which would win admiration from a
Babbitt.
Caricatures which aim to depict char-
acter as well as externals are exhibited at
Sedon’s Gallery (Melbourne) by Noel
Counihan. Cruel, almost brutal, at
times, he easily squares the ledger by
being most ruthless in the job he has
made of himself. On his Archbishop
Mannix Counihan ought to congratulate
himself that he does not live in the
Middle Ages. Max Meldrum, Bob Croll,
Professor Greenwood are other notabili-
ties in the A-grade offerings. There is a
proportion of failures, but the average is
high. In his portraits Counihan is less
successful, and his cartoons and so-called
landscapes are more propaganda posters
showing the perfection of socialism and
the iniquities of capitalism than what
they purport to be.
The spring show of S.A. Society of
Arts, with a (quite unusual) vice-regal
opening ceremony, makes a record in
having entries from every State. Sid
Long’s landscapes, with misty atmosphere
so contrary to the clearer light of S.A.,
are admired accordingly. Will Ashton
appears only as a portrait by Norman
Carter; Hennessy’s self-portrait is one
of the best things in the show. Among
local artists, after the smooth and attrac-
tive figure-pieces of Leslie Wilkie, Direc-
tor of the Art Gallery of Adelaide, main
honors go to the versatile and much-
improved Max Ragless. He takes both
the landscape and the seascape annual
prizes ; also the Art Gallery has bought
his big etching of gums. The Melrose
prize, which has done a lot to encourage
the backward art of portraiture, goes
this time to an Everton Shaw bust. The
Gallery buys also a Travis Webber land-
scape. Whinnen and Waden are their
reliable selves ; S.A.’s younger school is
rapidly coming well to the front.
At' the Kozminsky Galleries —a new
art centre in Melbourne —is a collection
of pen, pencil and water-colors of Mel-
bourne and surrounding country done by
Charles Bennett when he was touring
with Louis Buvelot in the ’seventies and
’eighties, together with some flower
studies by Carl Hampel. Bennett’s
drawings depict an era of Victoria which
has passed, such as Old St. Paul’s
Cathedral and the Gold Escort head-
quarters, when the cadets were a notable
force. Hampel, who has met with suc-
cess in London, shows that he is now
painting with much more elaboration
than when he was there, but his effects
are less striking.
At the Grosvenor Galleries, Sydney, is
a show of pictures by a group of young-
sters who are studying commercial art
and who woo a more seductive and less
remunerative muse when off the chain.
The essence of modern commercial art
is to get a desired effect as simply and
as forcibly as possible and all the painters
represented seem to have assimilated a
good deal of useful information along
those lines. Most graceful thing in the
show is a head and upper torso of a
young man by Noel Rubie. Title is
“Lyric” ; a good one, for the lines sing.
Quinton Tidswell has been experiment-
ing in many fields. In “Boatshed, Old
Cremorne” and “The Headland, Bal-
moral” he handles oils boldly and suc-
cessfully. Charles H. Bassett, in “The
Incoming Tide,” a Darling Harbor
sketch, gets the movement of the water
very cleverly; to boot, the composition
is effectively balanced. Francis Sher-
wood exhibits portraits in water-color
that show a fierce determination to tell
the truth, but applies his method more
pleasingly to a sketch of an old wharf-
crane —a very spirited drawing of a tame
subject. Another water-colorist of
promise is Ronald H. Steuart, who keeps
his washes clean and transparent. He
achieves an against-the-light effect very
neatly in “Hilltop, Brookdale.” Carring-
ton Smith is a: water-colorist with rather
similar leanings, but his style is a bit
thin and anaemic. Nature is a less deli-
cate dame than he believes. Harold
Abbot’s landscapes, flower pieces and
portrait study are all sincere efforts, and
show a nice sense of color. Donald
Friend shows a couple of aborigine
heads drafted with a firm crisp touch,
and has delineated in a sketch of (appar-
ently) an artist at work, another example
of the white Malayan—a type which
seems to be known only to young artists.

A well-known Melbourne doctor
recently said “I have some very nice
things to say about Roboleine. It is
the finest preparation I have come
across. I had a case recently of an
infant who was declining rapidly and
they tried everything at the clinic without avail. All I did was to cut
down his feed and put him on Roboleine. He picked up almost immediately and
has never looked back since. I shall be delighted to recommend Roboleine
wherever possible.”
What more convincing proof could there be, that there is nothing like Sloboleine ?
And this is only one of many testimonials given by doctors and hospital staffs
everywhere during the last 25 years. Roboleine contains no drugs. It consists
solely of concentrated nourishment combined in a special way, rich in vitamins A,
B, C and D so that it is immediately absorbed by the weakened system and rapidly
transformed into good red blood and healthy tissue.
If you have a child who is not thriving, try Roboleine. Many mothers have
blessed the day when this wonderful tonic food first came into their home.

Humorous Competition Sketch:-
"ERNIE"
BY PETED NIXON
PETED NIXON
UmC WjL.
TO the Winkieshaft Angling Club truth
was everything. So much as men-
tion the ones that got away and
you were definitely branded a pariah of
pariahs. Exaggerate the weight of your
catch and be prepared for social ostra-
cism. But none of the five members of
the Winkieshaft could be even suspected
of such appalling indecency.
This then was the institution that Mr.
Fink had the audacity to approach as
a prospective member. Mr. Fink had
quite a small opinion of the conservatism
of the club and quite a large opinion
of Mr. Fink. By strictly following the
advice of his lawyer he had emerged
after twenty years in the city with a
gratifying income and a healthy pride in
his own. business ability. He was fifty-
five when he came to Winkieshaft and
began to show an interest in sport. In
summer he subscribed to the cricket team
and in winter to the football. In the
less offensive seasons he subscribed to
both. But Mr. Fink was not satisfied.
Mr. Fink wanted active sport, and so
he turned his attention to the Winkle-
"....feeling all those eyes on him,
shook his head and drooped.”
shaft Angling Club. He approached
McMurdo, the president.
McMurdo shook hands.
“I am honored, Mr.”
“Fink.”
“I am honored, Mr.
Fink.”
Local interest in the club
being what it was, Mc-
Murdo was very truthful.
He bought Mr. Fink a
drink and promised to put
the matter before the club
without delay.
That evening there was
a gathering of the or-
ganisation. McMurdo was
in the chair. The other
members were scattered
about the room. Dapford,
who managed the local
branch of the Bank of
China ; Bulway, the under-
taker ; Fortingham, the
butcher with branches ; and
Milner, whose chief claim
to fame lay in the fact
that he was the most con-
scientious patron of the
“Lady’s Luck.” At the conclusion of
the discussion on Mr. Fink’s' appli-
cation McMurdo took the floor.
McMurdo’s voice was of the
sea-chantey variety. He blew
his nose and began:
Gen 11 em e n, —you are
now acquainted with the
pros and cons, the latter,
I might add, being few. The
question is: Shall we admit
Mr. Fink? In a few moments
I shall call on you for your
decision. Before doing so, I
would like to add a few
words. You all know Mr.
Fink. He himself is the most
impeccable of references. To
my mind there is no doubt
that Mr. Fink is the very
soul of honor, and as such
I feel sure would be an orna-
ment to our little society.”
Bulway interposed an objection.
“Honor is scarcely an ornament to
us,” he reminded his president.
McMurdo bowed.
“I beg your pardon. Nevertheless,”
he continued, “I hope my meaning is
clear. Mr. Fink will do his utmost to
further the aims of our club. I con-
cede that Mr. Fink knows nothing of
angling. But what of it?” He waved
an airy hand. “Mr. Fink is willing to
place himself in our hands. And now,”
he concluded, “I will call for a show of
hands.”
All hands went up for Mr. Fink.
MR. FINK, who had spent an agonis-
ing ten minutes in the bar (he did
not drink), was brought in and apprised
of the club’s decision.
Mr. Fink was inclined to droopiness ;
from sheer force of example his clothes
drooped, and even his spectacles, perched
high on his thin nose, were not altogether
beyond the prospect of suddenly droop-
ing over his nose and fetching up with
The hero of this
story.
a thwack against his Adam’s apple. His
speech of thanks was cut short by Milner
improvising a rule that new members
paid for celebratory drinks. Five minutes
later Milner, dodging the president’s cen-
sorious eye, unearthed a rider fixing the
celebration at half a dozen rounds.
As was natural, the conversation, sup-
plemented by Mr. Fink’s rounds, turned
to fish and fishing.
Of the talk there was much that was
interesting and educational to Mr. Fink,
but one thing puzzled him, and that was
—Ernie. Every now and then would
crop up some reference to Ernie. At
length Mr. Fink could control his
patience no longer. He hazarded a ques-
tion.
“Who is Ernie?”
The collective eyes of the Winkieshaft
Angling Club surveyed Mr. Fink with
unconcealed astonishment. Glasses that
had been half-raised dropped back to
the table as though all energy had been
drained from the arms that held them.
Milner took it upon himself tc give utter-
ance to the club’s one thought.
“Good heavens, mean t’
say you don’t know Ernie?”
Mr. Fink, feeling all those
eyes on him, shook his head
and drooped.
“ ’Fraid I don’t,” he apolo-
gised nervously.
“You’ve heard of a fish, I
s’pose—thing with fins and
scales?” Milner suggested.
McMurdo interceded.
“It’s my fault, I suppose,”
he said easily. “I should per-
haps have enlightened Mr.
Fink. I should have remem-
bered that Mr. Fink is no
longer a stranger ; indeed, he
is orna”
Bulway coughed omi-
nously.
“He is one of us,” McMurdo hastily
amended. “The fact is, we should have
been less reticent than we have been.
However, it is not too late to remedy
the omission. Bulway, tell Mr. Fink
about Ernie.”
BULWAY cleared his throat, hesitated
and plunged in. It was quickly evi-
dent that Bulway was accustomed to
addressing vestry meetings.
“Ernie,” he began, “is the finest trout
in the world.”
A strict observer of the principles of
the club, McMurdo coughed warningly.
“The finest trout I’ve ever seen,”
amended Bulway. He raised his eyes
ecstatically. “What a fish! Four and
a quarter pounds of unquenchable fight-
ing spirit! ” He mouthed the phrase
grandly.
McMurdo coughed.
“That is,” said Bulway, “four pounds
and three ounces.” He paused. “Ernie,
Mr. Fink, is our chief asset. Ernie, Mr.
Fink, is worthy of the attention of the
finest anglers in the country.” He swept
an embracing glance towards his con-
freres.
McMurdo did not cough. Bulwav con-
tinued :
Arrival of Mr. Fink.
“It is no disgrace, Mr. Fink, to fail
to land Ernie. Ernie, in my opinion, Mr.
Fink, is the most difficult fish in the
world to catch.”
“Where is this Ernie?” meekly inter-
posed Mr. Fink.
McMurdo took a turn.
“In my stream,” he declared pridefully.
The natural question jumped to Mr.
Fink’s lips.
“If he’s in your stream, how do you
tell how much he weighs?”
The Winkleshaft Angling Club con-
templated its new member pityingly. The
explanation fell to McMurdo.
“It’s like this,” he began tolerantly,
“Ernie is, I am sorry to say, the only
fish in the whole waters really worth
one’s efforts. There are other fish, but
Mr. Fink’s first glimpse of the hero.
Ernie is the only real sport. Now, it
must be clear to you that if Ernie by
some mischance were killed a great deal
of the interest would depart from our
sport. To avoid this calamity, we have

framed a rule that whosoever catches
Ernie is called upon to return him to
the water. You see,” he concluded, “we
have our cake and eat it at the same
time. And that, incidentally, explains
our knowledge of Ernie’s weight.”
“It’s rather cruel, isn’t it?” Mr. Fink
objected half-heartedly.
“Not at all,” responded McMurdo.
He paused to add weight to his coming
statement. “Do you know that fish en-
joys being caught! It gives him a thrill.
I don’t believe there’s anything he likes
so much as lying for a few breath-taking
moments on the bank.” McMurdo’s next
words rolled out in a burst of pride. “I’ve
hauled him out seventeen times my-
self.”
“Nineteen for me,” chimed Milner.
Neither Dapford, Bulway, nor Fort-
ingham were reticent over the number of
their conquests of Ernie.
Mr. Fink then and there
registered a resolve.
EACH week - end the
Winkleshaft Angling
Club gathered at the home
of McMurdo. It was
through McMurdo’s
grounds that the choicest
part of the stream flowed.
Accordingly, on the week-
end following his inclu-
sion in the club, Mr. Fink
put in an appearance. To
his ears he was loaded
with angling parapher-
nalia. The creel he car-
ried suggested, at the very least, deep-
sea fishing. McMurdo hurried him out
of sight.
The next morning Mr. Fink rose early.
Even so he found his host before him.
Descending the stairs, he encountered
McMurdo entering the house. He was
wearing a disreputable suit of tweeds.
He waved cheerily to Mr. Fink.
“Another tussle with Ernie,” he as-
serted loudly. “Eighteen for me.” He
slapped Mr. Fink heartily across the
shoulders. “That’s the thrill for you,
Fink.”
He left Mr. Fink conscious of a glow
of admiration into which had intruded
a shade of envy. There, thought Mr.
Fink, was a man capable of conquering
the redoubtable Ernie before breakfast,
and here was Mr. Fink, a being in every
way superior. Four and a quarter —no,
four pounds three ounces —of Ernie before
breakfast. Mr. Fink snapped his jaw,
and only the imminence of breakfast pre-
vented him fetching his rod.
BREAKFAST over, he went down with
the others and had his first sight of
Ernie. An olive-green back and a swirl.
Mr. Fink held his breath while Ernie
withdrew to his hide-out in the close-set
greenery. Mr. Fink was excited. He
whetted his lips and suggested his plan
to McMurdo. That gentleman was not
encouraging.
“I think you’d do better with some-
thing easier for a while,” he suggested,
“until you get into the way of it. Come
with me and I’ll give you a few hints.
It has been mentioned before that Mr.
Fink had a good opinion of Mr. Fink,
and Mr. Fink’s blood was up. Mr. Fink,
for perhaps the first time in his life, had
discovered a real ambition. Now was
no time to brook any suggestion of in-
competency. He was adamant. He
sorted out his gear and set to work.
Within half an hour he tangled his line
half a dozen times in the shrubbery.
Meanwhile the others had vanished in
search of their own sport. At length,
when the ache in his arms had become
unbearable, Mr. Fink desisted, gathered
his things and returned to the house.
The month that followed brought
many heart-burnings to Mr. Fink. His
efforts to trap Ernie remained unre-
warded. Meanwhile Milner’s tally had
jumped to twenty-three and McMurdo’s
to twenty-two, and Ernie had gradually
put on weight until he was now four
and a half pounds. Quite evidently the
activity agreed with Ernie.
AND then it happened. To this day
Mr. Fink is not quite clear as to
what actually did happen. There was a
strong suggestion that Ernie was ill, or
perhaps he had taken to drugs, or was
swimming in his sleep. But no matter
what it was it happened, and happened
quite definitely. Mr. Fink hooked Ernie!
Mr. Fink’s account is confused. His
confusion dates from the moment his
fly vanished in a flurry of effulgent
green. Mr. Fink went hot all over and
almost forgot to droop. A heady intoxi-
cation swept over him. In that brief
moment Mr. Fink was in the sway of an
emotion that shook him through and
through. He repressed with difficulty an
“... must have dieted!”
almost overwhelming desire to shout. His
heart, every pulse in his body, beat with
a quivering ecstasy. Mr. Fink, his spirits
singing, settled to the task in hand.
Within two minutes Ernie’s pulsing form
graced the mossy bank.
Mr. Fink could hardly believe his eyes.
There was Ernie, with his look of, Mr.
Fink fancied, you’ve had your joke, ol’
man, now don’t you think you ought to
toss me back.
Mr. Fink’s first impulse was to re-
store Ernie to his natural element, but
the thought of removing his eyes from
that glistening body was almost too much
to ask. Mr. Fink was human. A few
seconds of contemplation; then he re-
membered his spring-balance. This was
a chance to put Ernie’s weight beyond
question. He dived into his haversack.
Ernie must have dieted.
Mr. Fink read four
pounds.
Mr. Fink looked at
Ernie, and then suddenly
reason tottered. Ernie
seemed curiously still. A
sudden agonising empti-
ness seized Mr. Fink. He
peered at Ernie. There
was something disturbing
about the glassiness of
Ernie’s eyes, and he was
still —so still. This was
hardly the attitude of a
fish who thrived on being
caught. Gathering Ernie,
Mr. Fink made a pan-
nicky rush to the bank and plunged
Ernie’s still form into the water.
It floated lifelessly. Not a doubt
remained in Mr. Fink’s mind. Ernie
was dead. With a burst the fuller revela-
tion of his infamy leapt at Mr. Fink.
And there was no excuse. Mr. Fink
stood there.
THE moment of static anguish passed,
and Mr. Fink, putting indecision
behind him, waded in and retrieved
Ernie’s body. In Mr. Fink’s mind the
enormity of the offence was being aggra-
vated with every second. The Winkle-
shaft Angling Club demanding an eye for
an eye flashed before his eye. And Mr.
Fink, like many another man placed in
an awkward position, sought the way
out.
A very obvious inspiration came to his
aid. In its preliminary form it sug-
gested that Mr. Fink should leave the
deceased Ernie in the water and pretend
an ignorance of the occurrence. Then
he remembered the accusing hook-marks.
No, he must cover the offence some
other way. Mr. Fink climbed the hill,
and in a clump of bushes dug a hole.
Inside ten minutes Ernie had entered his
last resting-place.
Mr. Fink returned to the house. He
met McMurdo going out.
“I’m off to have a fly at Ernie,” volun-
teered that gentleman.
Mr. Fink mustered a feeble “B-best
of luck.”.
He vanished into the house and went
straight to his room. All afternoon, in
a sweat of anxiety, he kept to his room.
At dinner-time, however, hunger gained
the upper hand, and he made a reluctant
appearance. It seemed in his distorted
imagination as he entered the room that
the accusation of all eyes was upon him.
He drooped.
McMurdo, however, greeted him en-
thusiastically.
“Well, Fink,” he declared complac-
ently, “did it again! That makes twenty-
five.”
Mr. Fink waved a dazed hand across
his brow.
“You —you caught Ernie?”
“That’s right,” affirmed McMurdo.
“Remember, I mentioned I was going
after him.”
Mr. Fink managed a question.
“What —what does he weigh now?”
“Almost four and three-quarters.”
A dazed Mr. Fink sat down.
“I got him, too,” put in Milner. “Must
have "been after you, McMurdo. He
gave me a bit of a tussle, too. Makes
twenty-seven for me.” He smiled com-
placently.
ALL this happened five years ago.
Since then the Winkleshaft Angling
Club has flourished exceedingly. Mr.
Fink has become a more efficient angler.
In all, he has managed to land Ernie one
hundred and fourteen times. Milner
holds the record with one hundred and
fifty-three (just two ahead of McMurdo),
and Ernie has grown into a fine trout of
some fifteen pounds and a quarter.
I beg your pardon, Mr. McMurdo —
fifteen pounds and three ounces.

COLOSEPTIC
Do you know the reason for those
frequent headaches, listlessness,
jumpy nerves, insomnia, weakness
and feeling of exhaustion ? It is
‘Autoxima/ or Self-poisoning, the
name given by physicians to the
unhealthy condition caused by in-
complete elimination of the waste
products of the body. Owing to a
flabbiness of the intestinal muscles
caused by soft foods and insuffi-
dent exerdse, particles of food-
waste are left in the folds and
crevices of the intestines. Millions
of poison-producing germs breed
in this waste, the blood stream is
polluted, and your whole bodily
health suffers.
AVOID HARSH LAXATIVES
Violent purges, habit - forming
laxatives and intestinal lubricants
may give you temporary relief, but
they will not rid you of self-poison-
ing, because they do not get at the
basic cause. Before you can enjoy
perfect health you must be clean
internally. Drink COLO SEPTIC.
Coloseptic has a three-fold action.
It not only removes the evils asso-
ciated with self-poisoning, but it
has a beneficial effect upon your
general health and looks. Firstly,
Coloseptic loosens the stagnant
waste matter from the intestinal
walls and gently flushes it right
out of the system. Secondly, it

THE HORSE DEALERS
BY
HAROLD MERCER.
“Thirty quid’s my
price for that ’orse,”
said Sniggins.
Bailey shrugged.
“Reckon ’e’s Peter,
do you ?” he de-
manded.
Comedy of Profit, and Loss:-
SNIGGINS stamped into the bar with
a heavy displeasure towards the
whole world and, muttering his dis-
content as he greeted the landlord, made
a gargle of the first mouthful of his beer.
Having in this fashion settled the dust
of the morning’s travel, he emptied the
jug at a draught and pushed it over for
replenishment.
“That flamin’ ’orse!” he snorted as
Ryan looked inquiringly at him. “ ’Ow
fur is it to my place? Ten miles! It’s
taken me two and an ’arf hours to do
it with that big-limbed, lanky, misbe-
gotten”—
“’E doesn’t look a bad ’orse,” said
Ryan, looking out to where the steed
leaned, as if half asleep, against the
buggy shaft. “Well bred, ain’t ’e?”
“Bred? Bred? You’ve blanky well
’it it! You’d think the stiff-necked
’ad been trained to a baker’s cart. Wants
to stop and deliver a loaf every coupler
yards or so, an’ ’as to be whacked out
of the idea that ’e’s in a delivery-cart.
Me arms are sore using the whip. Me
mouth is dry with dust and cursing.”
“ ’Ave one with me,” said Ryan oppor-
tunely. He threw a question over his
shou|der as "Think-
ing of selling , im? „
"Sell ’im? If I knew anyone I wanted
to do an injury, I’d give him away.”
“There’s the butcher,” suggested Ryan.
“ ’E could do with a nextra ’orse.”
“What! Bailey! That low-down .”
Ryan was oblivious of Sniggins’s
quarrel.
“Better’n giving it away,” said he.
“Well, Bailey can ’ave ’im for a fiver.”
“It looks like a good ’un,” said the
publican reflectively, eyeing the steed
again. ,
“If Bailey likes to ’ave ’im, ’e can git
’im for a tenner,” amended Sniggins.
With a sudden gush of hospitality,
Ryan filled the mugs again. “Listen,”
he said confidentially. “I owe that cow,
Bailey, one. Treats me rotten over the
meat ’e supplies, an’ takes me down in
his charges. If I complain ’e says the
charges are right, and I can take it or
leave it; and a pub ’as to ’ave meat.
What about me puttin’ it to ’im?”
“ ’E can ’ave it for fifteen quid,” said
Sniggins.
HERE Ryan nudged his arm; and,
with a scowl and a curt nod to the
newcomer, Sniggins moved his mug of
beer away and took his seat on the form
which ran along the wall as the meaty
man with the purple face approached
the counter. Bailey’s look in his direc-
tion was equally unfriendly.
Ryan accepted Bailey’s invitation to
“have one,” and thrust his face forward,
whispering. Sniggins, assuming an air of
preoccupation, heard:
“If you want a good bargain . . . he’s
getting another ’orse, and wants to sell
this ’un.”
“That thing,” sneered Bailey, with
deliberate insult, casting a supercilious
look towards the front of the pub.
Sniggins checked a rising impulse to
demand what he meant by disparaging
his horse, and remained superbly indif-
ferent to the undertoned conversation at
the bar.
At last he moved to have his mug re-
filled.
“Why not ’ave one with us?” asked
Bailey in a conciliatory tone, and pro-
ceeded to talk in an easy, friendly
fashion about generalities until at last
he said:
“Ryan tells me you’re thinking of
selling the moke. If that’s so, I don’t
mind taking ’im off your ’ands.”
“Thirty quid’s my price for that ’orse,”
said Sniggins.
Bailey shrugged.
“Reckon ’e’s Peter, do you?” he de-
manded. “Well, I don’t want an ’orse ;
but if you wanted to make a sale I’d
give a quid or so more’n the right price,
for friendship’s sake. I wouldn’t mind
six quid.”
“Oh, ’ere, give us another drink!”
cried Sniggens derisively. “Bailey’s
trying to buy some meat!”
“I ain’t got no zoo contract; and even
the lions ’d object if they was fed on
that.”
“ ’E’s a well-bred ’orse,” said Snig-
gins fiercely. “ ’E’s by Lightning, and
a sort of cousin to Lightning nearly won
a Cowflat Welter Once.”
“Oh, well, if you don’t want to sell
’im! ” said Bailey indifferently; but a
moment later he walked to the door
and called old Jack Pullem, who was
inspecting the quadruped they had been
discussing.
“We’re just going to ’ave one, Jack,”
he said. “What’d you think would be a
good price for that ’orse out there,
Jack?”
“ ’E’s a good-looking ’orse,” began
Jack. Then he noticed that the money
for the drinks was in Bailey’s hand
and there was a fierce prompting in his
eye. “Erbout nine or ten quid would
be a good price,” he said as he reached
for his mug. He glanced again at Bailey’s
eye. “I wouldn’t like to give more than
seven quid meself.”
Sniggins snorted and drank his beer
quickly; then he signalled to Austin,
who had entered hopefully at the other
end of the bar. At the same time he
planked the money down for more
drinks.
“I was just saying, Bill, that I’d take
thirty quid for that ’orse of mine. Fair
price, eh, Bill?”
“Cripes, I wish I ’ad thirty quid!
I’d close with you like a shot!” said
Bill enthusiastically. He had no doubt
about who was shouting.
SOME business called me out —I had
been writing in the parlor at the
back of the bar. When I got back the
little group had grown to a crowd, all
arguing about horses, with only an occa-
sional definite relation to the one in the
front of the pub.
Bailey raised the point again.
“I’ll tell you what I’ll do,” he said, in
the manner of one bestowing the gift of
everlasting life; “I’ll give you nine-ten
for the ’orse.”
“It’s a fair offer,” murmured Martin.
“A darn good offer I call it,” said Old
Jack.
“You oughter close with that, Arty,”
urged a man with a red nose.
“Fifteen quid’s the lowest I’ll take for
it,” said Sniggins firmly.
“Dirt-cheap!” remarked Young.
“Giving it away!” said Tweedale.
“If you take it to old Paul, he’ll give
you more than that,” put in Austin, “an’
Gawd knows he don’t give no money
away.”
“What about another one?” inquired
the commercial traveller who had some-
how got into the argument. “I don’t
profess to know much about horses, but
did you ever hear the story of the
girl”
WHEN the bar was more or less offici-
ally closed for the night, the argu-
ment became still more confused.
Sniggins and Bailey shook hands many
times and wondered why they had not
been better friends in the past, and the

You may decide to buy, at some time in the future, an article,
the price of which precludes its immediate cash purchase.
It may be a piano, car or wireless set. It may be medical or
dental expenses, the cost of a holiday, the discharge of the
obligations of affection or friendship at Christmas or other
times of celebration, the higher education of children, the
inevitable demand of rates, taxes or insurance premiums.
Lack of foresight has worked great hardship in numberless

predetermined amount will forestall all the worry and anxiety
that usually await the unready.

commercial traveller tried to get a hear-
ing for limericks in between little side-
whirls of discussion upon everything
from religion to crops. There were a
few combative interludes, and then
Bailey’s voice rose, very blurrily, to pro-
claim that he and Sniggins were the best
cobbers in the world, and, because of
that, he was prepared to pay eleven
pounds for the horse.
“Norrer penny lesh than fairteensh
quid,” stammered Sniggins.
Some merciful person had stabled the
horse, and I heard Ryan tell his wife
that Sniggins was putting up for the
night.
The babel blurred into a murmur ;
and then Bailey’s voice, very thick in its
tone, declaimed:
“Look ’ere, Arty, bloodsh shicker y
warrer, and, we being frien’sh, I ain’
goin’ ter lerrer quid sthand between ush.
Twelfsh quid forra ’orshe—there! A
nact o’ frien’ship. Because I know you
shink I took you down over that—hie —
paddoesh.”
“Yoush a blanky liar!”
Sniggins’s voice rose passionately,
There was a sudden tumult, the sound
of much struggling and the bang of
falling chairs ; then the more sober voice
of Ryan interfering.
Sniggins’s voice rose in pained passion
as he declared that he was not a mug
and nobody had taken him down.
Then the meeting, most of it, fell out
of the hotel, and Sniggins fell towards
his bedroom, explaining plaintively to
Ryan, who helped to -prevent the falling
being too drastic, that he was not going
to be insulted by being told he had been
taken down. It would take a better man
than Bailey to do it, anyway.
, „ ,• , • ,•
C NIGGINS was gloomily drinking his
beer next morning, trying to forget
his headache, when Bailey came in open-
handedly. He evidently wanted the hoise
badly,
“No good nursin’ ill-feelin’ over what
happened last night,” he said generously,
“We were all a bit shot. How about
taking that nine-ten for the animal?”
Austin came in by one door and
Martin by another, and moved towards
the bar.
Sniggins refused to unbend.
“Twenty quid’s my price,” he said,
Young entered, just as Bailey, in a
conciliatory fashion, called for drinks ;
Old Jack and Tweedale, also, were just
in time. The knot of the night before
was soon assembled, prepared to con-
tinue the argument and the free drinks.
But when the evening began to close
a Sabbath silence had fallen on .the hotel.
“Where’s the mob?” I asked. “Have
they all gone down to it again, or is the
horse sold?”
“Bailey paid eleven pounds for it!
replied Ryan,
“Who do you think got the best of the
bargain?” I asked.
The publican grinned,
“I did,” he said. “They spent twenty-
two quid deciding it.”
Drama On the Golden Mile:—
MURDER?
BY- W.CHARNLET.
Lying in my bed with a beard which
hid who I was, I watched her, devouring
her beauty with my eyes. How I wor-
shipped her —craved for just the touch
of her hand, the caress of her smile!
And how I despised Hambleton !
rHE first time I set eyes on
Hambleton he was drunk.
Nothing extraordinary about
that! But there was, for his
clothes were so well cut, while his
face had such an aspect of—shall
I say?—degraded intellectuality,
that he stood out distinct from
the common drunks who littered
the footpath or slept on the seats
around the Boulder Block. He was walk-
ing with that stiff gait which a drunken
man affects when he imagines himself
still sober. He staggered, however, as he
passed into the big corner pub for some
more.
“Some dipso., that!” remarked a
fellow-lounger.
“Know him?” I inquired.
“Only that he was the accountant at
Brookman’s Junction up to a few weeks
ago. Got the bullet for filling the blokes’
pay envelopes with fivers instead of ones.
Been on the drunk ever since.”
THE next time I saw Hambleton he
was sober. Rather sick-looking and
pale.
The surface boss brought him along
to where we were cleaning out the Ivan-
hoe condenser boilers, and handed him
over to us. I felt sorry for the poor
devil! I was sorry enough for myself.
Cleaning condenser boilers was about
the limit in agony. Only stone-brokes
took such a game on. I was stony
myself that week, owing to one delirious
hour at the Block two-up school.
The boilers were long, narrow tanks
in which a man crouched and chopped,
chopped, for eight or more hours at the
six-inch-thick incrustation of crystalline
salt. And the heat! Whew! The sun
beat direct on the unsheltered iron tops ;
the brickwork would burn the hand ; as
a final touch, the boilers on both sides
were always under full fire. With a
shade temperature of 100 degrees, we
sat in the sun during spell-o to cool off.
I knew that Hambleton could never
stand such toil. But for an hour he
gritted his teeth and bogged in. Then,
when the head chipper called “Spell-o!”
and we clambered up through the
narrow manholes, our clothes soaked
with salt and sweat, he gave it best.
“God!” he explained. “How do you
stand it? I’m beat. I can’t go down
there any more!”
We took pity on him, letting him lie in
the shade of the tanks, only rousing him
when, occasionally, the boss came round.
At crib-time he chucked it up and
went, but returned later with a kerosene-
tinful of beer. He had been to the office
and drawn pay for the half shift, and
this was his way of expressing his grati-
tude.
“Couldn’t be a better way,” was our
opinion as we sank that four gallons of
ice-cold nectar. We had a hilarious
boiler-chipping bee that afternoon, for
we had a tarpaulin muster and filled the
tin again. We scarcely felt the heat at
all —only when the boss threatened to
sack the whole gang, and did sack me,
because we were two hours behind
schedule and the mine was nearly hung
up for water.
AFTER that attempt at hard work
Hambleton tried no more. He went
on the Block. Being on the Block in
those old Golden Mile boom days was
about equivalent to being a Yarra Bank,
or a Domain, dosser ; one of those dere-
lict creatures who lived on the fringe—
how, no one knew or cared.
I saw him often, and, having plenty
of leisure, grew to know him well. Some-
times he was sober ; but drunk or sober
he was the best of company. He could
sing a song; discuss books and verse ;
even himself turn out a bit of decent
jingle. In fact, it was the odd rhymes he
managed to sell to a Sunday paper that
gave him a few shillings for beer and
food. One could live around the Block
virtually without money in those days.
Counter-lunches were stand-up meals,
and few miners cared to drink with the
flies; a really industrious “hummer”
could get a skinful every day.
Sometimes he kept sober for a week.
I think he despised himself and made in-
effectual struggles against his weakness.
During these spells of sobriety we would
walk the mines together, professing to
look for work, but really viewing, with
a kindly interest, the ant-like toil of
others. Most times Hambleton haunted
the Block.
The Block was a busy place. All
around the huge crushing plants of the
mines roared in constant tumult, and on
the granolithic pavement which circled
the Dirty Acre the tide of unwashed
humanity ebbed and flowed, but never
wholly ceased. Hundreds of men —
miners, storekeepers, gamblers, loafers,
thieves, murderers, drunkards, all kinds,
good and bad, but never a woman among
them all. In the five hotels the glasses
clinked and the cash registers rang cease-
lessly. Around the corner the big eating-
houses filled and emptied as meal-time
came and went.
With the afternoon a certain slackness
came over the scene. Offshift miners

went home to sleep or get ready for the
four o’clock whistle. Business became
dull. The westerning sun, glaring on the
pavement, made the drunks sleepy, caus-
ing them often to fall off the seats and
sprawl in the road until someone in dis-
gust pushed them underneath.
I T was like that on this particular after-
* noon: filth and somnolence, yet
with a certain activity here and there.
Suddenly, from somewhere a smart lady
appeared. She had a young fellow about
her own age for escort, and she came
fluttering along, obviously ill at ease,
clutching her skirts and looking doubt-
fully around. She was an event! Even
some of the drunks became aware of
her and opened bleary eyes to stare, and
the gamblers in the s.-p. shop left off
their game and came to the door to
watch where she went.
How can I describe her? She was
beautiful, yet when one analysed her
feature by feature she might have been
plain. Her nose, for one thing, was too
large and too strongly shaped. But her
eyes were liquid pools, brown and full
of light. Her mouth was large, but well
formed and full of strong white teeth.
Rich red lips. Her hair was brown, with
a glint of gold where the sun touched it.
It contrasted well with the cream of her
complexion.
Yes, she was beautiful: amid the un-
couthness of that place she looked like
a lily.
She stepped daintily along, glancing
timidly at’ each face as she passed. She
stopped in front of Hambleton. He was
sitting on a seat outside a hotel, his
head bowed and his face hidden in his
hands.
For a moment she hesitated, then
stepped forward and touched him. He
started, made a gesture as though to
brush the intrusion aside ; then opened
his eyes and looked up. ■ .. - -
“Margaret!” he gasped.
She managed to smile. “I have come
to take you home,” she said gently.
A curious crowd began to gather. I
moved to her escort’s side. I knew him:
his name was Leveret; he was brother
to one of the big mine managers.
“This is his wife,” young Leveret whis-
pered. “She has just arrived from Syd-
ney. You know him: help us get him
away from here!”
We got Hambleton into the car; then
they took him away, up to Leveret’s —
one of the big houses on the crest of
the Mile where the managers and their
staffs lived like princes. Later I learned
that she and the elder Leveret’s wife
were sisters.
FOR a full month after that I saw
nothing of Hambleton.
Then one day I found him at the
office of the Golden Deeps—Leveret’s
mine. He was leaning against the veran-
dah-rail talking with a group of other
office men. He looked well: tall, clean-
shaven, dressed in a well-cut suit—a gen-
tleman. The mantle of respectability
clothed him again; evidently he had
been received back into the fold and
been given a job of pen-pushing.
I avoided the Golden Deeps after
that; if he wanted to make good I was
not one to hang round and remind him
of the past. Anyway, shortly afterwards
I was enticed to Kanowna to have a go
at shaft-sinking on the lead there. This
took about three months; then, having
bottomed a couple of duffers, I returned
to Boulder.
The first night I was back I went
across to the Block, and the first man I
saw as I stepped around the screen in
Powell’s Hotel was Hambleton. Sodden
and unsteady, he lurched against the
counter. His companions were the un-
washed loafers from the seats outside.
The sight made me sick. I turned and
went out again. I had meant to have a
night of enjoyment, but the thought of
Hambleton’s wife —her hopes, her shat-
tered dreams!
Leaning against a verandah post, I let
my eyes wander to the outer gloom,
where the glare of the incandescents
faded into the darkness of the flat that
led down to Boulder.
Suddenly I fancied that a hand beck-
oned out there—a woman; beckoning
to me! I strolled quietly to investi-
gate. Did she realise her danger —stand-
ing out there, alone?
It was Hambleton’s wife.
“You are the man who helped us that
day,” she began pleadingly. “Tell me,
is he in any of those hotels? Four
nights ago he went out, and I have not
seen him since. They told me that he
was here at the Block drinking again.
Tell me that it isn’t true. He promised
so hard. Swore. Took the oath. But
I’m afraid.” Tears swam in her eyes.
“I have to say that he is home, sick.”
I lied to her boldly. “No, he is not
here. Not in any of the hotels.”
She hardly believed me, but I per-
suaded her to go home ; the outskirts of
the Block was no place for a lone man
to be wandering, let alone a woman. I
saw her to her door, to the little cottage
on the Golden Deeps where she and
Hambleton had started life again. I
waited until the lights switched on, then
turned away. I would get hold of
Hambleton, sober him and send him
back-in the morning.
But' I never regained the Block that
night. Half-way there a thug, who must
have trailed me, sprang from the shadows
and hit me with a sandbag, then kicked
me as I lay unconscious because my
pockets yielded so poor a reward. When
I woke, towards dawn, I was chilled to
the bone and crippled. Three days later
the doctor sent me to the Kalgoorlic
Hospital with pneumonia.
FOR weeks I lay in a crowded ward,
too sick to notice or care what went
on around me. Typhoid supervened, and
the weeks stretched on endlessly; but I
was young and strong and battled
through. The crisis passed and I began
slowly to mend, and began to take a
little interest in my bed neighbors.
Yet I think it was her voice that first
stirred me. I was lying half asleep,
and for a moment I had an odd fancy
that delirium was coming on again, for
I had often heard her in my raving fan-
cies. But it was really her —Hambleton’s
wife—and she was talking to the nurse
about someone who lay in the next bed.
When she had gone I looked. Hamble-
ton! ; (
I called to him, but he gave me a
frenzied eye that held no sign of recog-
nition. Fever!
After that I lay and watched him—for
days—for weeks. How he moaned and
raved and tossed. As the weeks passed
I could see him becoming a mere skele-
ton, skin and bone —like myself, who
scarcely hoped to rise from bed again.
She came to see him often ; first stand-
ing at the foot of his cot, looking at him
with pitying eyes; then later, as he
slowly turned towards recovery, sitting
by his side giving him words of cheer
and comfort.
Lying in my bed with a beard which
hid who I was, I watched her, devouring
her beauty with my eyes. How I wor-
shipped her —craved for just the touch
of her hand, the caress of her smile!
And how I despised Hambleton! That
he should have allowed a few pots of
brown beer to take precedence over a
creature so gracious! For her sake I
would have given up anything, almost
life itself. But he was never a slave to
his passions: it was his appetites that
held him in bond.
VERY slowly he recovered. The day
came when he was permitted to
take milk diet, although hard food of
any sort was strictly forbidden.
She became hopeful then, and one day
as she sat at his bedside she spoke of
the future.
“This fever, although it has been so
cruel, has been for your good. Your
body is cleansed. All the alcohol has
left your system. Now you must never
drink again. Surely the craving must be
gone?”
Her voice was pleading as she begged
the answer.
With eyes like slits, I watched. From
the hungers of my own body I guessed
what he would reply.
“Well, it hasn’t!” he whimpered. “I’m
famished. I would sell my soul for a
sandwich and a glass of beer.”
I saw the fear leap into her eyes.
“Sell my soul! I’m starving. So, for
God’s sake, next time bring me. some
biscuits and just a small bottle of beer.”
“But I daren’t!” she protested. “It’s
against the rules.”
“Curse their rules; I’m starving!” he
snapped peevishly.
She looked at him long and steadily.
“I had hoped your craving for drink
would be gone.” '
He groaned in misery. “How you harp
on that point—just when a man’s at-his
worst. The mere thought of a good long
drink makes my mouth water.”
Again I saw the look of fear in her
eyes. Then it faded into something else, <
a secret thought that I could not define.
“You won’t forget,” he whispered as
she rose to go, “some biscuits and a
small bottle?”
TPHREE days later she came again.
* Once more she sat at his bedside,
and I had to listen.
“Did you bring anything?” he said.
She shook her head.
He swore savagely.’ “You’re as bad as
the rest.” '
She bore with his peevishness, and,
when it was time to go, smoothed his
forehead and kissed him. Then she stood
for a long minute at the foot of his bed
contemplating him.
“Good-bye,”.-she said-softly.:
After the ward had been cleared of
visitors Hambleton showed me a packet
of biscuits. “She’s a trump after all!”
“Don’t eat them!” I begged. “You
know the doctor’s warning. Just one of
them would kill you!”
He soaked a biscuit in his glass of
water. “Surely one wouldn’t hurt a man
this way. Try one?”
My mouth slavered at the sight of the
proffered packet, but I shut my eyes
tight. I knew that death lay in those
crisp baked flakes. Hadn’t I seen
Denison, who had lain on the other side
of me, go out feet first through eating just
one boiled lolly. Other men, too, had
died just the same way—the nurses held
them up to us as terrible examples.
Hambleton paid no heed.
“I’m only eating one!” he said.
But after that one he could not stop.
His hunger became like a flame, all de-
vouring. Before the end I heard his
teeth crunching.
An hour later, when the nurse took
our temperatures, he registered 104 deg.
—and was delirious. My own tempera-
ture ran 102 deg.—caused by the struggle
■to retrieve the empty packet from the
floor, where Hambleton had tossed it.
i “He’s been eating something?” the
nurse demanded furiously. She searched
our lockers, and . found the crumpled
packet.
NEXT morning Hambleton died. His
wife was sent for just before the end.
She was calm, a little wistful and sad.
Her voice was decorously low as she
thanked the ward sister for her sympathy.
Did she feel remorse, I wondered;
did she realise that strychnine could not
have, been more deadly than that simple
packet of biscuits?
.Watching her, so calmly beautiful, I
could believe her innocent. Yet by cold
analysis I knew she had murdered
Hambleton.
I saw her again the other day—in
Hay-street, Perth. Her car was a de luxe
super six. A little older,. but not less
beautiful, she sat. like a queen watching
the passing crowd. Somehow our eyes
met, and I .could have sworn that recog-
' nition flashed. Then she looked away.
“Mrs. Leveret,” my companion re-
-1 marked, following my glance. “They
have piles of money. Made it on the
goldfields. He is her second husband,
they say. You should know her! ”


Pelmanism
Scientific training of Mind,
Memory and Personality
.. . “and another charm of Pelmanism
is that it transforms every Pelmanist
into his own Sherlock Homes ,,
E. V. LUCAS, Essayist and Assistant Editor of London “Punch.”
OHERLOCK HOLMES, the most
K -' acute mind in fiction!
His extraordinary confidence,
his pois£, his calm, his amazing
ability to penetrate to the essential
heart of a problem rested on “that
blend of close observation and
deduction” which Mr. Lucas is at
pains to point out is an integral
part of the Pelman System.
The analogy between Holmes
and Pelmanism goes further for
Pelmanism concerns itself, not only
With the material for thought which
observation supplies and with the
exercise of the reasoning faculties
inherent to deduction but also with
quick decision and appropriate
action. Thought is rarely effective
in itself; its logical outcome is
action. Something has to be done,
and Sherlock Holmes in fiction and
the Pelmanist in real life are alike
in possessing the final qualification
of success: after observing and
deducing, they act
PELMANISM is a transforming
influence. It transforms by
developing personal qualities and
attributes that make the individual
stand out in any community and
in any circumstances. Amongst
these attributes and qualities the
most important are:
Observation
Concentration
Judgment
Self-Confidence
Will-Power
Initiative
Promptness
And a Reliable Memory.
'HESE qualities are the base on
which steadiness, serenity,
stability and energy rest. Pelman-
ism strengthens them by scientific
methods based on natural laws
until they become habitual and are
exercised in all the affairs of life,
in ordinary everyday matters as
well as in crises and on big occa-
sions.
It is proper to admit frankly
that Pelmanists do not wish to
be ~ transformed into Sherlock
Holmeses. They want to be them-
selves, but themselves at their best,
with all their powers developed,
with their physical and mental
competency at its highest pitch so
that they can in their chosen walks
of life, or in new walks if necessary,
acquit themselves honourably,
courageously and successfully.
They seek command of themselves,
they strive for that happiest of all
possessions, a habit of life, thought
and work that earns the respect of
their associates, makes them effec-
tive in their regular employments
and lifts them to the top of any
special occasion that may arise—
but only as themselves, for the
Pelmanist is an individual with his
own name, his own peculiar powers,
his own lawful occasions and his
own personality.
Many other prominent people besides Mr. E. V. Lucas have spoken highly of Pelmanism
and more than 650,000 people have gone through the Pelman Course. Below are
opinions received recently from some of the 31,000 who have enrolled with the Pelman
Institute in Melbourne. \Ve could fill a whole “Bulletin with such letters.
PRINTER (29/6/*34) —I have attained a
standard of efficiency which has epabled me
to secure an executive position. The obscure
and complex are now clear and simple.
CLERK (14/IQ/’34) —I have just received
my Diploma in Economics at the Sydney
University and I am grateful to the Insti-
tute for showing me how to use my mind.. .
Pelmanism is an enemy of fear and ignor-
ance, it is packed with commonsense and
practical advice and with inspiration to
bigger living.
PLANTATION MANAGER (17/8/'34) —
I am the youngest plantation manager in
the Solomons. 1 undoubtedly owe my success
to Pelmanism.
CHEMIST’S APPRENTICE (27/S/’34)
I wish to express my gratitude to Pel-
manism. I feel entirely remade. My obser-
vation, concentration, personality and, above
all, my memory have improved.
ENGINEERING DRAFTSMAN (S/6/’34)
The exercises set certainly made me think
for myself.
BHEEPFARMER .<l4/0/'34) — I have kept,
an account of the time spent on the Course.
It amounted to a shade under three months
and the average time per day— 4o minutes.
COMMERCIAL TRAVELLER (15/4/’34)
There are twenty-four Lessons, because on
each Work Sheet returned I have found as
much information and, instruction as was
contained In the Lesson itself. c
ASSISTANT GROCER (23/3/’34) —I Would
strongly advise anyone who is feeling
depressed, or who is weak-willed or who may
be naturally shy in company to join up
with the Institute.
BANK CLERK (5/5/’32) —I now have
ideals, thoughts and an outlook which enable
me to increase my efforts towards the goal
of honest, honourable and successful
endeavour.
ENGINEDRIVER (28/2/’34)— lt is with a
wonderful sense of ability and security that
I face the future,
ARTICEED CLERK (14/10/’32) —I have
enjoyed and appreciated the Pelman Course-
as 1 have rarely enjoyed anything before.
BANK CLERK (6/3/’33) —I was a bit
sceptical of all the claims you made for it
but I know now that they were not exag-
gerated one iota.
CONTRACTOR (23/l/’34) Another dark
corner of the mind has been garnished and
made orderly.
