Poet and Psychologist
The genius of the poet, that subtle some-
thing which seems to transcend mortal limi-
tations and reach into the empyrean, draw-
ing thence expression, has at length been
brought to ground. At least such is the
claim of the psychologist. He has laid
hands on the spirit of poesy, and subjects it
to his analysis. The poet’s soul has been
laid on the operating-table, and Charles
Baudouin has undertaken its dissection.
( Psycho-analysis and /Esthetics; George
Allen and Unwin). The book is an applica-
tion of psycho-analysis to the theory of
esthetics illustrated by a detailed study of
the works of the Belgian poet Emile Ver-
liaeren. To his task the author brings a
special equipment, since, besides being a
psychologist of the new school, he is him-
self a poet, well known and widely read in
his own country—a fact which assures us
that the subject is in sympathetic hands.
The formal school of psychologists con-
tented itself with laying down certain laws
with regard to the association of ideas or
images. The imagination was a capricious
thing, the irresponsible outcome of an aggre-
gation of images. One mental image called
up another, but we were left in the dark
as to the process by which one thing in par-
ticular was selected from an infinite number
of like or similar things. That the choice
is not a hazard, a throwing of mental dice,
is what the school of analysts sets out to
prove. It depends, they claim, on a strictly
psychological determinism. The imagination
does not “bloom capriciously on the very
surface of the mind,” but springs “from the
depths of our being.” The imagination “is
wholly guided by the affective life; by the
sentiments, the emotions, the instincts that
accompany the images.” It is around these
centres of attraction that the ideas or images
cluster. “Thus the images disclose .the affec-
tive kernel around which they have been
aggregated; and the affective kernel, in its
turn, accounts for the formation of the
images.” We have here disclosed the exist-
ence of a relationship between “the life of
feeling and the life of imagination.” The
interplay between feelings and images may
go on quite unconsciously in the mind of the
subject, and with it a process of condensa-
tion or linking together of images, forming,
as it _ were, a complete picture. “Thus it is
that in a dream the landscape we have never
seen, but which, nevertheless, we seem to
recognise, is an amalgam of a number of
landscapes which we actually have seen.”
In such condensations there frequently
occurs a “displacement of affective stress,”
so that where the elements composing the
whole differ in importance, the less import-
ant may take a major place. The general
effect of such displacements, by giving images
of minor importance a high relief, is to re-
nress into the sub-conscious the more im-
portant, he., those to which the feeling or
the emotion attaches. We have, therefore,
in the analysis three important factors to
consider: condensation, transference (dis-
placement of stress) and suppression.
The poem, Baudouin considers, is akin
to the dream; but “what we have to under-
stand when we speak of such kinship is that
the play of the imagination is identical in
the dream and the poem. The difference
between the dream and the poem is to be
sought, not in a difference of kind in the
imagination, but in ‘sensibility.’ ” The
poet is endowed with a vigorous imagina-
tion, _ but not with a specific form, of
imagination. “That whereby the poet is dis-
tinguished from the child, the neuropath, the
dreamer, and from those who are exercising
any kind of non-artfstic imagination, con-
sists of qualities which do not belong to the
imagination, but to ‘sensibility’ on the one
hand and to will on the other.” By sensi-
bility is meant, apparently, aesthetic sus-
ceptibility. “Perhaps we may say that a
dream is the outcome of the imagination s.et
to work by a commonplace ‘sensibility,’ and
that a poem is the outcome of the imagina-
tion animated by a refined ‘sensibility.’”
A characteristic of poet and dreamer alike
is that both work through symbol—by sym-
bol being meant a result of condensations, dis-
placements and repressions—and the symbol
is “the very essence of imaginative acti-
vity.” The author goes on to say: “Psycho-
logical analysis discloses that the poet, even
when he believes himself to be objective, is
usually expressing something more than he
believes himself to be expressing—something
different. His work, apparently objective, is
likewise the involuntary symbol of a sub-
jective reality more or less unconscious.”
Verhaeren’s work was selected for analy-
sis because the poet is one of the simplest of
writers—“one of those who most conspicu-
ously exhibit the hallucinatory spontaneity
of the dream.” His symbolism is, there-
fore, pre-eminently favorable for the appli-
cation of the psycho-analytic method. M.
Baudouin unravels the condensations of the
poet’s imaginative creations, and disentangles
the_ displacements and repressions. To
achieve this end “we must,” the writer says,
seek to discover the feelings and the mem-
ories to which each element of the conden-
sation is linked in the poet’s psyche. The
method will reveal, with a clearness that is
often amazing, the inner psychological mean-
ing of the most obscure symbols.” The
author freely admits that the Freudian
theory, from which his own method is partly
derived, may in many respects be open to
strong criticism; nevertheless “the practice,
harmonising as it does with the most con-
crete data of psychology, is entirely accept-
able.
. All works of art are more or less subjec-
tive, bearing the stamp of the author’s indi-
viduality : “but what we are beginning to
perceive is how it has become a subjective
expression, in virtue of what intimate
mechanism this development has occurred.”
It is interesting to follow M. Baudouin in
his dissection of the poet-mind, though some-
times his methods are obscure. The sceptic
may cavil at some of the symbolism as ex-
travagant and far-fetched; on the other hand
lie must admit, from the most cursory exami-
nation of his own mind—so far as he may
find that possible—that there is a linking-
up between objective impressions and the
subjective moods of the mind. The art and
literature of Russia and Italy are wide
apart; each has its own subjective impress,
the result of a gloomy sky or of a sunlit
landscape. What the psycho-analyst pro-
poses to do is to carry this very general
proposition into minute detail.
T. B. C.
Eyeless Sight
We have got used to the term “memoi
sight,” applied to a mental process developec
during and after the war by the sightles
soldiers, and from which a great deal
enjoyment has been obtained by the total
blinded. But “eyeless sight” (“extra-retina
vision” and “paroptic perception” are othe
names) is another pair of sleeves; and s
far as one can judge from a perusal of
book which has just been published about i
it opens up no vista of pleasurable anticipa
tions to the sightless. The idea is that ther
are innumerable microscopic eyes (ocelli
in the skin, capable of affording usefu
vision when the “subject” has been carefull
and assiduously trained. What puzzles m
and makes me inclined to be sceptical of th
existence of this “extra-retinal vision” is th
fact that “subjects” after a stance ofte
express themselves as thoroughly exhauster
and even go so far as to decline to continu
with the experiments. If the thing wa
genuine and ocelli did really exist, wh
should they not always be on duty like othe
organs of the body? Why should they hav
to be so coaxed to perform their physiologi
cal function?
Yet it must be confessed that the autho
has gathered round him a powerful ban
of believers who are not in the least per
turbed by the jeers and frank unbelief o
the Paris doctors. First and foremost oi
the list of the convinced is the octogenarian
Anatole France, who is always ready to pu
up a fight for the weaker party, and who
in this case participated in a seance in hi
own house. Dr. Georges Duhamel, who i
a leading literary light (he was recently
feted on his vist to London) as well as
doctor, is also on his side; and there is
Dr. Andre Cantonnet, the chief ophthalmic
surgeon to the Cochin Hospital, who has
allowed experiments to be conducted in his
own operating-room there, and has expressed
his belief in their genuineness by signing
paper for publication. The author is
novelist, poet and dramatist. His pseudonym
is Jules Romains (in private life he is
Louis Faragoule), and he began his experi
ments in 1918, his book being ready in June
1920. During its composition his theories
were turned down by the Academy oJ
Sciences, the Academy of Moral Sciences anc
the Sorbonne. In October, 1920, came what
he calls the ambush of the Sorbonne. He
was caught napping with his apparatus, his
trained “subjects” were hundreds of miles
away, and he was given only a few hours
to prepare, during which he got hold of a
very imperfectly-trained "subject.” Accord-
ing to report he made a poor showing, ant
excited ridicule; but he maintains that he
was very successful under the circumstances
Anyway, Jules Romains got level with the
sceptics; in his role of dramatist he pro-
duced a play a few months ago, in which,
like another Moliere, he held up the medi-
cal profession to ridicule, and all P’aris
enjoyed the joke.
Here and there in the book statements
occur which are hard to reconcile with
the laws of physiology and optics. The
alleged behavior of “extra-retinal vision” to
variations in the intensity of sunlight, for
example, leaves the reader wondering at the
demands made upon his credulity. It would
be taken as a matter of course that on a
day of bright sunshine the ocelli would be
stimulated to put forth their best efforts,
but the writer says that the contrary is
the fact. He says that if retinal vision be
taken as a unit, then when the experiments
were conducted in bright sunlight the extra-
retinal vision was usually about one-
thousandth ; whi|e if the “subject” was
in a room poorly lighted by the sun,
it might jump to as high as one-third.
That is to say, on a sunny day extra-
retinal vision would be a thousand times
less than _ retinal vision, but in weak sun-
light it might increase to only one-third less.
At the beginning the writer says he ex-
perimented for a month—a dozen sittings of
an hour—without the faintest sign of vision
appearing. He, however, learned that
strained attention was the great factor.
After putting in five or six hours per diem
he began to see small objects, and, later,
letters and print. He began then to study
the properties of this vision, its range, visual
field, and its behavior to colors. In ordi-
nary bi-retinal vision the field is cone-
shaped, being jiarrow on the nasal side, where
it is about 65 degrees, and widening out at
the temples to oyer 90 degrees. Thus in look-
ing at objects in a room one has to move
about, or turn one’s head. Extra-retinal
vision differs from this, and after much
training it becomes circular, or, better,
spherical, and finally attains 360 degrees.
A well-trained “subject” would be able to
see a window, or a person behind him, and
in so doing would, of course, be seeing with
the back of his neck!
The general medical opinion in Paris,
whence the book comes, is that M. Jules
Romains has been reading up embryology,
and that, having learned that the eye,
embryologically, is a spread-out piece of
skm, he thought that the skin might like-
wise be a spread-out eye: hence his treatise.
Llis explanation of how the skin acts as a
sort of reserve organ of sight is ingenious,
and he has gone to several well-known and
famous physiologists for his material. He
says that the paroptic function can only be
attributed to a group of microscopic organs,
situated in the epidermis, which are called
ocelli. Each complete ocellus is morphologi-
cally constituted as follows: (1) of a nerve-

ending, already described by Ranvier under
the name of meniscus; (2) of a coarse oval
cell with a big nucleus of remarkable retrac-
tive powers (the sensory cell of Ranvier) ;
(3) of a nerve-fibre supporting the expan-
sion, and linking it with the system of
ocelli. The nucleated cells rest on the
menisci. Physiologically, the ocellus is a mi-
croscopic eye, rudimentary but complete, and
the whole organ is oriented outwards. It
includes a refractile body (the oval cellule),
an ocellary retina (the meniscus), and an
optic fibre (the nerve-fibre which supports
the expansion). He means to say that in
the skin we have a dioptric system in minia-
ture • but it seems to me that the skin has
quite enough to do as a protective and
excretory structure without having foisted
upon it the additional function of serving as
a reserve visual apparatus, and a very poor
one at that.

Epitaphs
Persons of feeling have been known to
remark that an event borrows its significance
from the circumstances which accompany
its occurrence, while it is common data of
psychology that association lends a powerful
bias to the discrimination of memory. Well,
accept those two propositions, and think of
Stoke Poges. If you happen to be a lawyer
the name will remind you of the notable
dictum of Scrutton, La.J., in Hemmings v.
Stoke Poges Golf Club, wherein is approved
the principle that a trespasser in possession
may not recover damages against a true
owner entitled to possession in respect of
the said owner’s re-entry on his land (but
not, mark you, with strong hand and multi-
tude of people). But, fortunately, we are
not all lawyers, and it is because a don
of eighteenth-century Oxford found in the
village churchyard of Stoke Poges much
matter for musing that most of us associate
any interest with the name of that remote
hamlet. I suppose there is no composition
in verse more widely read among those
much-maligned individuals, Average Man
and his cousin, Man in the Street, than
Gray’s Elegy, and yet the very title pro-
claims its gloomy theme. Scampering about
breathlessly in opposite directions, trying to
wear a cheerful face over a melancholy
spirit, dissimulating, laughing, crying, curs-
ing and beseeching in the same moment, we
all seem to be forever trying to hide the
substratum of gloom which pervades poor
humanity.
It is this that accounts for our predilec-
tion for pessimistic philosophising; this, too,
which may explain why the widely-read
In Memoriam columns of the Daily Scream
carry numberless fragments of unmentionable
verse expressive of the excellent sentiments
of the late victim’s misguided relations and
friends. Nor is this tendency confined to
amateur scribblers, for traces of it may be
discovered amongst the writings of the very
gr-r-reatest. “Under the wide and starry
sky” pieces are not at all uncommon; in-
deed, it is a poor poet who cannot write his
own epitaph. The evolution of the custom
may be traced at least as far back as Shaks-
peare, and probably there are anthropologists
who could point to its prevalence among
the Hodmadods of the Stone Age.
But when we have had our laugh at him
who gives himself up to dark reflections and
communion with that he calls his soul, when
we have sneered at vain imaginings and
“occult” fears, we might give some consider-
ation to the possibility of there being, after
all, some virtue in the fool. What more
natural than that a man, as he approaches
the solution of the great problem, should
put himself to speculation and to re-weighing
of such values (if any) as experience may
have led him to draw from life? Life —
what is it? Fruitless query, futile desire,
obscure image which so taxes the thinker’s
powers of explanation that he is soon driven,
with David Hume, to give it all up as an
inexplicable mystery. Often the whole
essence of the writer’s nature, the key to all
his hopes, beliefs, doubts and premonitions,
may be fitted into an airy line or two of his
passing song. Walter Savage Landor (I
could never understand why the text-books
label him “minor” poet) reaches, with his
eightieth year, a sublimity of indifference:
I strove with none, for none was worth my strife;
Nature I loved, and, next to Nature, Art:
I warmed both hands before the fire of life ;
It sinks, and I am ready to depart.
Gordon’s sick drover in the Spring flings
his winter garment of repentance, playing
the game to the end: —
For good undone and gifts misspent and resolutions
vain
’Tis somewhat late to trouble. This I know —
I should live the same life over if I had to live again ;
And the chances are I go where most men go.
Henley’s “Invictus” is a barbaric challenge
flung in the teeth of the dreadful Unknown;
but he strikes a gentler note elsewhere, con-
vinced at the last that eternal truth abides
in nothing else than the soul’s aesthetic ideal-
ism :
So be my passing!
My task accomplished and the long day done,
My wages taken, and in my heart
Some late lark singing,
Let me be gathered to the quiet west,
The sundown splendid and serene,
Death.
In a dark corner of the graveyard, above a
neglected mound where weeds struggle with
crumbling stone for mastery, one H. D.
Lowry speaks in weathered marble his little
piece, and it would be hard to find its peer
outside Keats and Shelley:—
Thuswhen earth darkens and the voices call,
Art will grow less, and small forgotten things
Will steal, like stars into the evening sky,
Into your heart, and you will hear the call
And, at the last, make answer, well content.
And so they all, each in his own peculiar
way, seek to fill the Answerer’s role. Philo-
sophies have risen, declined and fallen; phi-
losophers, in number as the sea sands, have
lived, argued, despaired and died. But
through all the ages the poets have epito-
mised their life’s creed in phrases that linger
even while the profundities of the metaphysi-
cians are lost in that outer darkness which
all their systems can by no means enlighten,
and _ which refuses to acknowledge the
dominion of the schools or the reign of
Intellect. It may be that thought endures
only when it is set to music: it may be that
Shelley will outlast Kant. Happv indeed is
he who can share the uncritical philosophy of
the Bloke, with its unquestioning acceptance
of things-as-tliey-are as best: —
I’ve studied books wiv yearnin’s to improve,
To ’eave meself out of me lowly groove,
And ’ere is. oil the change 1 ever got:
’Ark at yer ’eart, an’ you kin learn the lot.

The 810,000-mile Wanderer
Mrs. Charlotte Cameron, who dropped in
on Sydney over a year ago, has now 810,000
miles of travel to her credit. Surely this
beats Curie, of “The Show,’ and
possibly the Wandering Jew. Yet it does not
represent all her achievements in almost per-
petual motion, for she has as well carried
out several journalistic missions. Her last
book, Wanderings in South-Eastern Seas
(Fisher Unwin), will help to divert tourist
traffic to (especially) Singapore, Borneo,
Java and Tasmania. These are not
untrodden ways to a big percentage of
Australasians, but most of us, curiously
enough, like to read of places to which we
have been rather than of those to which we
may never go. Mrs. Cameron, albeit she
is mostly away from home, has the eye of
the woman at home —the hostess’s eye,
alert and sympathetic, and it roves widely
over the domestic side of European life in
the tropics and native life in the bazaars.
This quality in her books makes for a
suecial appeal to women readers. But the
history, politics and trade of each country
are never overlooked, and (priceless diplo-
macy !) all information is given unobtru-
sively. It might be a good cigar in disguise.
Her impressions of the private life of the
wealthy and cultured Chinese families of
Singapore couldn’t be done by one of the
sex that doesn’t carry a powder-puff.
The book is crammed with quotable items,
A humorous interlude was a drive to visit
the Sultan of Johore. A Malay driver took
the party—a very thirsty party —through
the grilling heat to the top of a hill crowned
with a big building. They sent in their
cards, and presently were invited to enter.
A large number of Sultans were at home-
under tons of marble. “It was the first
time,” remarks Mrs. Cameron, “that I’ve
left cards on the dead.” It was the burial-
place of the Sultan’s ancestors. Inciden-
tally, she tells us that the State motto of
Johore is “Unto God resigned”—very like
that of Almighty Dollar-land: “In God we
trust.”
On landing in Malacca the first bit of
local color seen was the carcase of a big
crocodile. Close by several good taxicabs
were waiting. At Sandakan, in North
Borneo, three visiting-cards were brought
to the writer —“Two men and a lady, Miss
Bensley.” She went down to greet her visi-
tors. The “lady” proved to be an ourang-
outang. “Miss Bensley” was dressed hor-
ribly in mixed native and European style,
and from a long hairy arm hung her leather
card-case. She shook hands and behaved
like a Darling Pointer —until a glass of
whisky-and-soda was handed to one of the
men guests. Then she broke down, grabbed
the glass and drank with relish. Elsewhere
Mrs. Cameron describes the festival of Tai-
pusam, having forced herself to witness the
rite from beginning to end. Spikes and dag-
gers were thrust into the devotee’s shoulders,
around his heart, and his abdomen was
“threaded” with them. One devotee, instead
of being “spiked,” pulled a decorated little
car along a two-mile course by hooks thrust
into the flesh between his shoulders. He
seemed quite fresh and happy. The curi-
ous thing is that the tortures drew no blood
anywhere—“a fact that puzzles scientists
and medical men.”
A colorful impression of the seething life
of Java is given along with an outline of
the history of its acquisition by the Dutch.
A few years ago—before the war, for instance
—the cost of travel in that glorious land was
quite reasonable. Mrs. Cameron couldn’t do
it last year under some five pounds a day.
Tonga, American Samoa and Tasmania
are in the itinerary. The last-named en-
chanted the visitor, and her impressions
are illustrated by some good little reproduc-
tions from old prints. For that matter the
whole book is well illustrated.
A. C. M.
An Offering of Swans
“Mr. Cosgrave, head of the Irish Government, re-
leased two white swans in the river Liffey, at Dublin.
They were presented by Senator Gogarty in remem-
brance of his escape from the Republicans. He got
away by swimming the river.”
Dr. Gogarty’s gift to the Liffey recalls an
astonishing literary coincidence, and has
given him a title for his book of 23 poems,
published early this year in Dublin, with a
foreword in which W. B. Yeats praises their
grace and joyousness.
Oliver Gogarty is a Senator of the new
Free State Parliament, and a year ago was
taken from his home in Dublin by armed
Republicans, to be imprisoned in an empty
house on the banks of the river outside the
city. It was a situation of great peril, and
it is probable that his murder was contem-
plated. Seizing an opportunity as he and
liis captors alighted from the motor-car, he
sprang into the river, which was in flood,
and under cover of darkness escaped the
shots which followed him. As he swam in
the winter night he made the river the pro-
mise of two swans as a thankoffering, and
it is these swans that the cable tells us
President Cosgrave has released.
The doctor is not only a poet and politi-
cian ; he is a friend of the band of poets,
novelists and playwrights who have made
Dublin one of the most significant literary
cities of Europe and the centre of the Irish
Renaissance. It was in this group that
George Moore met him when he (Moore)
had come to restore the intellectual prestige
of liis native land and set Dublin by the
ears, as lie tells with such malicious charm
in “Hail and Farewell.” While in Ireland
Moore wrote “The Lake,” the novel of a
priest of a lakeside village, who loses his
vocation, and at the book’s end migrates to
America. The beginning of his dissatis-
faction with the uneventful life that had
seemed so perfect to him is the realisation
of harshness in his conduct towards a young
schoolmistress who had “sinned” in his
parish, and whom he had driven away. The
fear that she may sink in the squalor of
London leads him to seek her out, and her
letters to him as she travels Europe as gover-
ness to a wealthy child complete his un-
doing. One evening lie goes to the lake,
leaves his clerical clothes neatly piled on the
bank, swims to the opposite side, where he
has provided others, and betakes himself to
a seaport, intent on experiencing the suffer-
ing and trials of unsheltered life in the
United States. Moore called his priest Gog-
arty, and Father Oliver Gogarty at that.
To use the name of an acquaintance in a
piece of fiction without his consent is un-
pardonable ; but when the acquaintance is
a prominent Catholic, and the character
who bears his name is in popular judgment
nothing but a renegade priest, the anger of
Gogarty and his friends can be realised.
“But such a name!” excused Moore. “It
was made for me, and I could not pass it
by. No other would have done so well.”
Years later Gogarty cheated death by
swimming the Liffey as his namesake had
escaped to life by crossing the lake. Surely
one of the most extraordinary instances of
art anticipating life! “Nature is catching
up,” as Whistler said when someone re-
marked on an effect that recalled one of his
pictures.

A Satchel of Books
The Perilous Transactions of Mr. Collin, by Frank
Heller, translated by Pauline de Chary (John Lane).
A series of adventures whose hero is a Swedish crimi-
nal —probably humorous in the original. The stories
show a mechanical ingenuity, and one, “The Story
of the Absent-minded Gentleman,” strikes a new idea.
The Hawkeye, by Herbert Quick (Bobbs, Merrill).
A well-told story of America in the malting; the
hero a farm-boy on the lowa prairies. A son of
pioneers among pioneers, his career is carved out in
primitive surroundings, among people simple even
in their roguery. The characterisation in this novel
is its strongest feature.
A Cure of Souls, by May Sinclair (Hutchinson).
A rather ironic study of a country rector who wears
the name of Clement Purcell Chamberlain and has
a “pale vicuna dressing-gown” and various habits
to match. The writing is good, and several scenes
are well handled. A visit to a woman dying from
dropsy affords a perfect snapshot of a clerical soul
revolting at some of the grosser facts of life.
Captain Shapely, by Harold Brighouse (Chapman
and Dodd). A tale of the Oxford-road in the days of
Queen Anne, and of a young man- —handsome, of
course —who broke heads and hearts and stole purses
and got in and out of trouble in a way no man could
to-day. Brighouse does the extravagant thing well;
and though you know the gallows must be cheated,
you don’t know how it’s going to be done till the
last pages.
Grab, by Andre Lichtenberger (Geoffrey Bles).
The romance of the daughter of a French colonel,
killed in action, who is driven by poverty to earn
a crust as governess in the household of a war-
profiteer. The hatred of those whom the war en-
riched is naturally bitterer on the Continent than
elsewhere, and this spirit is reflected in this well-
translated novel. But the situations are conven-
tional—and particularly the ending.
Friend, You Are Late, by Alice Herbert (John
Lane). The heroine marries an admirable character
whose sole disability as a husband is delicately
adumbrated by an insistence on his “high tenor
voice.” The lady, who had begun her matrimonial
career under the impression that passion and babies
were matters of indifference to her, presently dis-
covers her mistake. The end is unconvincing, but
the book is worth while if only for the wit of the
dialogue.
The Square Egg, by H. H. Munro (John Lane).
Munro, better known as “Saki,” was killed late in
the war; and this is a collection of previously un-
published odds and ends, with a biography by an
admiring sister. There are half a dozen or so short
stories, including “The Square Egg,” a humorous
tale of an interlude in the fighting; and of three
short plays, “The Watched Pot,” the least short,
has considerable merit. They were worth preserv-
ing, and the biography was needed; but the stones
will not add to the reputation of the wit who wrote
“The Unbearable Bassington” and looked to be
only just getting into his literary stride.
Poems for You, and Others, by Ruby S. Lyon
(Radio Press). Here are 26 sets of verses, some not
more than 12 lines long, and few exceeding 24.
But the amount of stereotyped moral sentiment
crowded into the poems suggests that Ruby Lyon
must be sister-in-artlessness to the authors of certain
American plays and musical comedies staged in
Australia of recent years. Titles speak for them-
selves in a measure —“Try To Smile,” “Going Home,”
“The Value of a Smile,” “Keep Smiling,” “Kind-
ness,” “Life’s Sunbeam,” and so on. “Do You
Feel so Sad and Weary ? Try to Smile” ; “Bat
Smiles Can Cheer a Lonely Heart like Sunshine
after Rain” —any good child might benefit by perusal
of these excellent copybook maxims, though a bad
boy might dismiss them with “Garn!” A note
from the authoress explains that the booklet is
sold at Robertson and Mullen’s for 2s. 6d., while
better-bound copies cost 4s. 6d.
Uncensored Recollections. Anon (Eveleigli Nash
and Grayson). This is the most piquant book pub-
lished of late. It is not particularly well written—
it has all the garrulity of a confirmed gossiper in
a breathless circle of old ladies —but it is full of
arresting anecdotes about elevated people. The writer
is most amusing about the regime of Napoleon 111.,
delves into the origin of the late Empress Eugenie,
and talks with the utmost abandon about eccentri-
cities, vices and other defects that could only be
cultivated in that period on an exceptional income.
There is a great tale of the education of the Arch-
duke Rudolph, who suicided at Meyerling 40 years
ago. The poor kid used to be awakened in the
dead of night and asked abruptly “Who was Scipio
Africanus?” “Where did peace break out after the
Thirty Years’ War?” and similar things just to test
his memory. Isabella of Spain, the Duke of Bruns-
wick, who w'ore emeralds for trouser-buttons; Mar-
shal Bazaine, Disraeli, Lord Suffield, Lord Pembroke,
Maximilian of Mexico and many more are mentioned
with a lively familiarity, and numerous witty com-
ments are quoted. Perhaps the best of them is the
answer of Napoleon 111. who, when told by his
pestering uncle Jerome that he had nothing of the
Bonaparte about him, replied sweetly: “Oh, yes;
I have the family.” One might add the riposte of
an old Anglophobic French Count who, on being
asked by a young girl what animal most closely re-
sembled* a human being, tartly remarked: “The
Englishman.”
True Adventures of the Secret Service, by Major
C. E. Russell, of the U.S. Secret Service (Hurst and
Blackett). When America entered the war Major
Russell was given charge of a special intelligence
section to combat the activities of German spies who
were making life uncomfortable for the American
Army in and around Bordeaux. He had a vast field
to cover, but he kept a special eye on a group of
Hun conspirators who were abusing Spanish neu-
trality at San Sebastian, and the story he tells of
how two of his men wormed their way into the
schemers’ confidence and ultimately acquired for
Foch the plans for the critical German offensive of
April, 1918, reads like the wildest fiction, though
it is apparently well authenticated. The leader in
a plot to burn down the docks at Bordeaux was
discovered ta be none other than the Kaiser’s young-
est son, Prince Joachim, who, in lieu of active ser-
vice, was doing his bit as a spy disguised as a Swiss
Red Crosser named Freytag. His identity was re-
vealed by the merest chance, and Russell arranged
to have him whisked from imprisonment by an
alleged American deserter and rushed across the
Spanish frontier. The plan worked splendidly, and
the Prince was so grateful for his escape that he
secured a passage to Germany for his rescuer and
an assistant, fully believing them to be lovers of
the Fatherland. How they went to Kiel from Spain
by submarine and got the plans aforesaid from two
traitorous Colonels is too long to relate, but the
author is entitled to call it “The Greatest Secret
Service Story Ever Told.” He suggests, by the way,
that Joachim committed suicide after the war be-
cause he was informed of the innocent part he had
played in the German downfall; but Russell admits
that there is nothing to support this speculation.


Equip your car with safety
Take the time to examine the Goodyear
All-Weather Tread; it tells its own story.
The extraordinarily dense and tough
material of which it is made assures
extremely long wear.
Its deep-channelled symmetrical pattern,
the wedge-like, keen-edged blocks that
form its design, attest its matchless grip-
ping power.
And the reinforcement at the base of its
blocks explains its quiet and vibrationless
running.
Even more eloquent of the slipless, skid-
less service of the All-Weather Tread is
the impress it leaves on roadway or street.
There, clean-cut and unmistakable, it
stamps the record of its reliable and
dependable travel.
There, ridged and notched in the earth,
is seen how this great tread clutches and
clings, digging through for solid footing
and security.
How it grips fast for traction under the
drive of the engine, and hangs on for safety
under the pressure of the brake.
You ought to have the new Goodyear
Cord Tyre with the All-Weather Tread;
it costs less in the end.
Goodyear means Good Wear .

The Reason
The Overland power plant is Overland-
designed and completely Overland-built.
The motor is a model of simple design and
efficiency. It turns up 27 horse-power on
brake test.
It is a powerful, rugged motor that delivers
more than the usual number of miles from
a gallon of petrol or a pint of oil.
Motor, clutch and transmission are a unit.
These vital parts are completely enclosed,
and are thus protected from mud and dirt.
The transmission is of the selective, sliding-
gear type —three speeds forward and
reverse. The clutch is of the disc type,
easy to operate and remarkably efficient.
The clutch runs in a bath of oil.
The Overland comes to you complete—-no
extras to buy. Its refinement of design
makes instant appeal to the man who
appreciates fine automotive engineering.
The foot-service and the hand-emergency
brakes both operate on brake drums of
large diameter and wide face. A hand
turnscrew adjusts the outer brakes. The
Overland has more braking area —actually
and relatively—than any light car on the
market. There is one square inch of
braking surface to every nineteen pounds
of car weight.
Proofs
In the Sydney “Daily Guardian” Three-
day Reliability Contest, the Overland ran
first in its class for petrol economy.
One Overland in Queensland under special
test put up the phenomenal mileage of 93
to the gallon.
In the last R.A.C. Queensland Test for
certified Stock Model cars only, Over-
lands ran Ist, 2nd, 4th and sth in the
Trade Class, and 1 st and 3rd in the Private
Class. .The best mileages respectively
were 66.4 and 52.8 to the gallon.
In the recent N.S.W. 1000-miles Non-
Stop Run, one Overland averaged 37.6
miles to the gallon, including 7 hours
standing time, during which the engine
was running without mileage being
recorded.
Last week at Canowindra, N.S.W., under
a special test and observation of the lead-
ing local newspaper and prominent
citizens, a stock model Overland did a
run of 171 miles, and proved 41.3 miles
to the gallon.

The Hulks.
Keels deep-sunk on the ooze they lie,
Hulls, worm-eaten, that know no more
High seas roving and waves mast-liigh,
Winds and ways that they knew of yore.
Proud and winsome ’neath sun and star,
Bows no longdr they dip and raise;
Mastless, plundered of sail and spar,
Rope and anchor, they pass their days.
Sea-growtlis tress them, and silently
Slow sea-creatures about them creep;
Tides sent in from the outer sea
Tell them tales of the windy deep.
Men no more at their mains’ls haul,
No wind now in their rigging wails;
Piping bos’ns no longer call
Drowsy sailors to trim their sails.
Arctic furies and tropic calms,
These for them are but memories;
Reefs of coral and isles of palms,
Roaring waters and lake-like seas.
There, untroubled by storm and strife,
Perils over and trials through,
Built by builders who dreamt in life —
Who shall say that they dream not, too?
Maybe into tneir teaß and pine
Those who fashioned them shapely wrought
Dreams of wonder and fancies fine,
Mingling labor with magic thought.
Oft, maybe, when the moon, pearl-white,
Silver gleams on their canvas threw,
Dreamers dreamt on their decks at night,
Careworn captain and sleepless crew.
Thinking thus, while the ripples stream
Round their hulls, and a dying breeze
Sighs and falters, to me they seem
Dream-ships freighted with memories.

Lost.
To think that you were once so near
I might have held your hand in mine;
To make dear friendship doubly dear.
Have learned the way your arms entwine!
No prescience came to me and so
I let the precious moment go.
Death came to claim you in the night—
Your trembling mouth, your banded hair,
Your fingers fluttering and light,
The heart that thought I did not care.
You went with summer winds that blow
Out of my life and did not know.
Now I waste hours in thinking out
The color of your dress and hair,
The way you moved your hands about—-
Such tender little hands and fair.
I dream the honey of your lip
As moths blown to the desert sip
In fancy flowers they cannot find,
While khamsin ribbons out its wings,
Or as a bird in forests blind
Of some blue sweep of Heaven still sings,
I think soft textures of your face,
An ankle’s slight unnoticed grace.
I lean from my grey window high
Above the lamplit yellow town;
I stretch my arms towards the sky—
You do not answer nor look down.
I think you triumph over me
Through gates to which you hold the key.
At midnight-hush you torture me
With proffered sweets I cannot take,
Revealing store of witchery
Hidden in life for pride’s pale sake.
O'er kingdoms forfeited you lean —
The crown of love you might have been!
QUEENSLAND.
M. FORREST.
Lonesome Palm.
Where sand and sea make equal calm
A mat of jungle lies;
And there one bent fanatic palm
Prays eastward, moslem-wise.
Green shoals in vain importune it,
White-clawed and harpy-eyed,
Singing unearthly songs that fit
The turning of the tide.
Its turbaned head droops in no dream
Of casket-shells of pearl;
It heeds not nights when fireflies gleam
Eyed like a dancing girl.
Day carves upon the turquoise sky
Its uncompanioned plumes;
At night its separate fronds defy
A depth of purple glooms.
Clustered afar, its lofty kith
And kin are met where none
Shall much regard the daily myth
Cried by the muezzin sun.

The Rose.
The night is very still; no movement stirs
This perfect rose, pale, pure and pearly
white
Beneath the mellow May moon's lovely light.
What dreams are hers
Of primrose dawn or glowing golden noon,
Or scented eve and blue and silver skies,
Of joy that passes, loveliness that dies,
Alas, so soon?
Perchance she ponders pensively the day
That is to be, whose happy morning hours
Will greet another peerless queen of flowers
With sovereign sway.
Remembering the breeze’s cool caress,
The ecstasy of each glad day begun,
Does she regret she gave her loveliness
To wind and sun?
Nay, tranquil and content, her fragrant
breath
Still scents the silence of the evening air,
Adream in dewy peace, untroubled, fair,
She waits for death.

TEN MILLIONS MORE.
Another nebulous scheme of “migration”
and big “land settlement” is announced, and
it is apprehended that full details may arrive
at any moment. In fact, there is no visible
hope of avoiding full details. The outline
which is available sets forth that Australia
is to be blessed with a loan in London of
“£10,000,000, at a low rate of interest, for
preparing land, roads and railways to serve
intensive settlement.” So the arrangement
has a familiar sound, and wears a hackneyed
countenance. A trouble that has been
troubling for a long while is that, though
real money may be borrowed in London, it
can’t, owing to exchange problems, be got
here except at ridiculous cost, if it can be
got here in large quantities at all. From
October, 1923, to April, 1924, this country
borrowed £18,650,000 of new loans in Lon-
don, so it wasn’t idle. But either the new
loans stayed where they were to pay interest
on old loans, which is unhealthy finance, or
they came in the shape of goods to damage
local industry, which is diseased finance. This
matter may prove a serious preliminary snag
in the way of the preparation of “land, roads
and railways to serve intensive culture.”
Yet there are worse features about the pro-
ject than that. In the first place, the coun-
try has more roads already than it can keep
in even passable order; which is to say that
it hasn’t enough population alongside them
to pay for proper making and subsequent
maintenance. And mere agricultural settle-
ment doesn’t look helpful. Settlement on
640-acre blocks implies two families to the
mile of road, one on each side; yet in most
of Australia 640 acres is no very lavish
patcii. It is the prosperous little industrial
towns which should provide for the upkeep
of roads, and support the farmer alongside
them, and supply business for the railways;
but they are pathetically scarce. As for
railways, there are already many more of
them than contrive to earn their keep,
and this difficulty can’t be met by planting
beside them the kind of people who specialise
in growing the kind of produce which has to
be carried at a heavy loss. Even wheat
could pay full cost of carriage to a handy
local market, and at the same time yield a
much better return to the producer; but
unless the country takes in earnest to the
cultivation of new lines, such as cotton and
flax, and builds cotton and linen factories
to meet the nation’s requirements, the local
market is used-up for a long while to come
at the present rate of population increase.
* * * *
The nebulous inspiration with the
£10,000,000 loan attached is that Britain
shall part with the people whom it doesn’t
want to lose, and of whom it really has no
great number to spare, and that Australia
shall get the people for whom it has least
use. Provided the project doesn’t fizzle out,
it is likely that a good many odds and ends,
including paupers and mental deficients, may
be passed on us in the rush. The last
Statesman’s Year Book gave the number
of persons in England and Wales engaged
in agriculture and fishing (the two are
lumped together) at 1,260,476. Its latest
quotation for paupers was 1,405,784, and
paupers and confined lunatics combined
amounted to 1,493,066. So it is easy to
see which class John Bull can more easily
spare. Australia’s position is that, despite
utterly reckless loan expenditure to promote
agriculture for export, the agricultural popu-
lation refuses to increase. Probably the
poorness of the return is responsible, com-
bined with the fact that the yield of the
principal vegetable is to a very great extent
eaten up by the cost of sea carriage. Con-
sidering the vast land and sea distances
which eat up the profits of the crop the out-
look for wheat certainly isn’t encouraging
for the investment of another £10,000,000.
* * * *
According to the prospectus or bill of fare
of the £10,000,000-loan project, the aim of
the movement is “intensive settlement,” which
is presumably small and vigorous farm-
ing of the kitchen-garden variety. If it
means intense hen-farming of the Bankstown
(N.S.W.) sort, the prospect, judged by ex-
perience, is poor enough. If it signifies fruit-
growing, that industry is also overdone.
There is money in growing green stuff and
fresh food where conditions are favorable
and where there is a great industrial popula-
tion at hand to furnish a market. For in-
stance, Denmark is smaller than Tasmania,
and it has nearly 200 people of its own per
square mile to feed, compared with Australia’s
one and a bit. Yet in 1922 Denmark col-
lected from John Bull some £41,000,000,
almost entirely for butter, bacon and eggs.
Belgium is less than half the area of Tas-
mania, and its own population is 636 per
square mile. Yet it sold close on £24,000,000
worth to J. Bull in 1922, including surplus
grain, flour, sugar, flax and vegetables of its
own growing. Gigantic Australia reckoned
it did well in the same year with sales
amounting to close on £58,000,000. But
Denmark and Belgium (in common with Hol-
land, which runs the same surprising game
on an equally large scale) can dump their
lettuce at almost no cost on the tables of the
peerage in London within a few hours of its
leaving, the ground. The idea of Australia
competing in the British vegetable market
with rivals like these, to say nothing of a
score of others, and making more than a
crust out of the game, is grotesque. But it
can create its own market at its own door
by compelling the artisan population which
lives on Australia to come here and live.
The market is more portable than the vege-
tables.
THE QUACK IN POLITICS.
A Queensland archbishop burst into a de-
nunciation of politicians last week: they
thought of themselves first, their parties next,
their country last, and God not at all. One
of them immediately replied that Australian
politicians were indefatigable in trying to
devise ways and means of saving the country,
and many had died in the attempt. Each
controversialist represents an immense body
of thought. The average politician re-
sembles nothing so much as the average
Chinese herbalist. Often he honestly believes
in his nostrum; and to that extent he does
not quite deserve the Archbishop’s wholesale
condemnation. On the other hand, it is im-
possible to prevent thousands from thinking
along the exasperated prelate’s lines: the
people have had so many nostrums foisted on
them —cures for social unrest, cures for
poverty, cures for the obligation to work
hard—and all have proved almost as
fallacious as a quack consumption “remedy.”
There was an Age of Faith in the politics of
our race, as in its religious development.
Froissart’s “mad priest of Kent” was the
nation’s first articulate Socialist, and all the
infallible recipes that his successors have
invented for the elimination of social and
economic distinctions have been merely vari-
ants on his proposals. Belief in the possi-
bility of social salvation by politics is far
from dead; but it has nothing like the old
hold, and as a result there is a general dis-
position to vilify the priests of the cult and
to run after new gods.
* * * *
Of these last the most popular is the most
preposterous, as often happens in revivalist
ferments based on pure faith. The name of
it is Internationalism. Internationalism is
a reaction against the effects of war, like the
Peasant Revolt which succeeded John
Ball’s crusade in the middle of the Hundred
Years War. The new movement, like the
old, derives not from logic but from emo-
tion : it considers not what is, but what
ought to be; it is based on a faith which
is itself baseless—that mankind in the mass
is ready for the Millennium. The Inter-
nationalists favor disarmament. They argue
that if rich, sparsely-inhabited countries—
Australia, for example—refuse to provide
themselves with armies or navies, and scorn
the thought of making it possible for others
to defend them by the creation of bases,
munition and supply depots, etc., the poor
and over-populated countries must be so edi-
fied that uiey will stay at home and starve
rather than act as Attila did 1500, Jen-
ghis Khan 800, and William of Germany
10 years ago. No strong, hungry nation
having ever displayed such saintly altruism,
it is necessary for the International case to
affirm that human nature has changed, and
so the apostles of the creed, in eftect, say
it has. The Internationalists believe that
this spirit of conciliation must be brought
into every relation of world life; and indeed
their doctrine would hardly be worth pro-
mulgating if they qualified it by claiming
that it is permissible to protect a food sup-
ply with legal, but not with lethal, weapons.
If the Chinese, who, like the Indians, are
becoming industrialised, care to send us
their sweated goods, let them! If the
Japanese, who are great farmers but have
no land, wish to settle in Australia, let
them! In short, Internationalism is a
greater ideal, they hold, than the mainten-
ance of our industries or our racial purity.
Communism is the other popular panacea
for human misery. It is Internationalism
applied to the social or domestic sphere. The
one assumes that an Australian unionist and a
Korean coolie possess common interests, and
have only to meet over a beer in a Trades
Hall council chamber for any little differ-
ences in their culture and ethics to be re-
moved ; the other assumes that there is a
way of starting a low-class coolie, an
average bricklayer and a High Court Judge
from scratch and keeping them level! There
is this, anyhow, to be said for International-
ism: it has never been given a'fair trial —
one of the points made, by the way, by a self-
styled cancer expert, who was sentenced in
England the other day for experimenting
with an ointment that burnt holes in his
patients. On the other hand, the absurdity
of Communism as a working policy is being
demonstrated everywhere every day. The
bone and marrow of pur social life is strife
—strife in the professions, strife in busi-
ness, and strife in sport. The struggle
that gives zest to existence is conducted
with a certain amount of amity in those
departments, especially the last. But when
it comes to party politics and religion the
enmity is bitter, and any attempt to remove
or even modify it is hailed by the zealots of
the warring factions as treason. Further-
more, internecine hatreds rage inside all the
camps. A. C. Willis, one of the leaders
of the political party that is putting for-
ward the Brotherhood of Man as a cure for
the world’s economic and other inequalities,
made this admission the other day :■ —-
Hatred;, was a poison, because where it operated
reason became warped. Unfortunately hatred per-
meated the Labor movement to-day.... The Labor
movement needed higher, ethical ideals, otherwise it
might prove a curse rather than a blessing.
Labor does not need higher ethical ideals:
what it requires is more practical ones, and
this applies to politicians generally. The
perfect political leader is never a St. Francis
of Assissi, but always a Descartes. There
would be no angry cries from archbishops if
all our politicians worked for the good of
the State in the same way that a healthy
man works for the good of his body and with
a similar freedom from cant about having
an elevated spiritual end in view. A fit man
keeps fit, not for the benefit of either his
neighbor or his soul, but because health is
one of the main roads to worldly success and
happiness. For the same impelling reason
he works hard, keeps out of debt, accumu-
lates enough to support those he may leave
behind him, and takes care that no one robs
him of his possessions or affronts him in his
dignity. The prescription for national suc-
cess and happiness is no less simple and
materialistic. The miserable nations to-day
are the proletariat ones—those that went
down in the late war or, even worse, were,
like Korea, never strong enough to wage a
war of defence. These nations are poor,
•debt-burdened, diseased, and (to the extent
that they have been disarmed) without hope
of recovery. The happiest nations are those
that own most; owe least relatively to their
assets; are freest from cholera belts, plague
epidemics and so forth; and have the best
expectation of, preserving their life, health
and honor—which is only another way of
saying the most, effective defence systems.
If all the politicians in Australia combined
as one party, and if they were advised by
all the priests and parsons from Broome to
Barrenjoey, they would find it impossible to
devise a scheme to keep the whole of the
population of the Commonwealth prosperous
and contented for a dozen hours. But any
party, without spiritual or other assistance,
and in face of the opposition which, under
our constitutional system, it would neces-
sarily expect, might safely undertake to keep
a very large proportion of the inhabitants of
this favored land reasonably prosperous and
contented for the whole of their lives. The
first requisite is to ensure that its riches
shall remain ours by making proper arrange-
ments to defend them. The next is to build up
industries for the attraction of that popula-
tion which is in itself wealth. And the third
is to preserve and improve the national
health. There is nothing empirical about
such policies. Throughout history, wherever
a nation has put them into practice, they
have brought (he race at least as near to
happiness as a successful individual is able
to get in this vale of tears. And where they
have failed the seeds of defeat have been
sowed inside rather than outside the nation’s
gates. If Australia, for example, remains
inadequately populated, it will be because
many Australians object to its industries
being adequately protected. If the national
physique degenerates, it will be because thou-
sands of well-meaning persons (including
archbishops and other churchmen) oppose
health measures of proved efficacy on moral
grounds. And if both tragedies are allowed
to occur it is practically certain that before
long we shall be required to hand the coun-
try over to exploitation by others, and to
learn by experience what national poverty
and humiliation mean.
HANS BARGAINS FOR NEW GUINEA.
The sudden resurrection of the German
colonising spirit in the shape of a concrete
offer from a German syndicate, with State
backing, to take over the development of
Dutch New Guinea has focussed Dutch at-
tention on that white elephant of the Nether-
lands Indies. Previous to this kindly display
of German interest, the average Dutchman
knew as much and cared as little about the
place as the average Australian cares or
knows about the Northern Territory. The
German offer caused as great a flutter in
Java as a similar offer from Japan to admin-
ister Port Darwin and environs would cause
in Melbourne. Opinion is sharply divided
on the subject. In Sourabaya, the hustling,
thriving, cosmopolitan commercial city, there
is a strong desire to let the German try his
luck. The material advantages of having
the enormous unexploited resources of the
country tapped by those indefatigable entre-
preneurs are frankly stressed. In Batavia,
the capital, however, there is a tendency to
resent the offer as an affront to the national
pride. Between the two it is impossible to
say in which direction opinion will eventu-
ally trend.
The Dutch East Indies are usually credited
with having population to spare; and the
Australian, touching at Java after days of
steaming along the coastline of his own
empty north, is apt to envy the Dutchman
the abundance of his man-power. When,
however, the Australian visits some of the
Outer Possessions he realises that the Dutch-
man’s problem is extremely like his own.
The island of Java, cultivated almost to the
very summit of its mountains, and carry-
ing a population of 35 millions or more, is
only a 12th part of the whole area of the
archipelago. Its 50,000 square miles of fer-
tile soil carry a population of 700 to the
mile. The remaining 686,000 miles carry
a population of less than 20 to the mile.
There are parts of Java where the pressure
of the inhabitants upon subsistence is so
great that it is worth while to lay soil upon
the rocks and cultivate it; there are thou-
sands of miles of country in the Outer Pos-
sessions whose coasts are uncharted and
whose hinterland, swamped in primeval
jungle, is utterly unknown. The develop-
ment of Java, with its railways, sugar-mills
and coffee- and tea-plantations, its amazing
rice cultivation, is impressive; but Sumatra,
lying alongside it in the main stream of
commerce between the East and West, is
comparatively empty and undeveloped. In
1020 14 million acres of land in Sumatra
were offered for lease; only 80,000 have been
brought under cultivation. The Government,
with an estimated deficit this year of 135
million guilders, has little enough money for
the needs of Java. Sumatra, which is crying
for railways, has to wait; and Celebes has
to be content with the promise of a tram-
line 47 miles in length. It is difficult to
induce the home-loving Javanese to emi-
grate from the over-crowded west to the
unsettled east of their own island; it is more
difficult to tempt them to cross the narrow
strait that divides Java from Sumatra; it
is quite impossible to get them to leave their
teeming motherland to battle with the grisly
terrors of New Guinea.
The problem that confronts the Dutch is,
in fact, very similar to the problem before
Australia. Sumatra, Java and Bali, com-
paratively well peopled, may be likened to
the parrow southern fringe of our own vast
continent, with its fairly numerous popula-
tion. The reluctance of the Javanese to
leave his ancestral home, with its ricefield
not yielding sufficient to fill the mouths of
his increasing family, may be compared with
the Australian’s disinclination to abandon
the fleshpots of the South for the tinned
butter and damper of the North. Celebes,
New Guinea and the innumerable islands,
large and small, that lie strung around the
Java Sea like the reefs of an enormous coral
atoll, are the Dutchman’s Northern Terri-
tory ; and over against them the Dutchman
sees Japan, with the Philippines for step-
ping-stone between, scanning the Pacific
horizon. Hence the Dutchman’s disappoint-
ment over the shelving of the Singapore
base and his anxiety over this question of
developing New Guinea. Better, some argue,
to have the German, with his base 10,000
miles away in the North Sea, as tenant, than
the possibility of an Asiatic Power in per-
manent occupation.
If the Germans had been a little more dis-
creet, if their proposal had not come in such
a questionable shape, the business might
conceivably have gone through without
awakening public interest. The Dutch
know how valuable German enterprise and
capital have already been in developing the
empty spaces of their vast dominions. That
was in the ordinary way of company invest-
ment. There is no objection to giving Ger-
mans concessions, even in Dutch New
Guinea, provided the conditions remain with-
in the scope of the existing regulations. But
the proposals smacked too much of making
a_ State within the State. “Since our colo-
nies have been taken from us,” said a Ger-
man spokesman, “and our colonial work
brought to naught, we should do our best to
show that we are still fit properly to colo-
nise.” Many Dutchmen do not care for the
notion of part of their colony being con-
verted into an experimental farm for German
imperialism. Actually, there is little to
choose between the constitution of the pro-
posed syndicate and the chartered companies
that have gone before. It is impossible to
isolate chartered companies, however bent on
business, from politics. It is impossible to pre-
vent them from increasing their military
strength, under the plea of necessity, to cope
with the uprisings which are an inevitable
consequence of all well-meant endeavors to
convert the lotus-eating islander into a com-
mercial asset. It is natural for chartered
companies to look to their Governments for
protection, covert or declared. The Dutch
remember with bitterness that when Holland
and Spain protested against the giving of a
Royal Charter to a British co. to administer
North Borneo, they were assured by Glad-
stone that his Government had no intention
whatever of assuming sovereign rights over
that territory. Seven years later a British
protectorate was proclaimed, and the coun-
try became to all intents and purposes a
part of the British Empire. The Dutch
have also a brotherly interest in the Boers.
They have not forgotten how, when Jame-
son failed in his famous raid, the British
Government promptly disowned the whole
adventure, though subsequent revelations
showed that, had he succeeded, he would
have had the assistance of the Government
to consolidate his gains. The Dutch have
no reason to suppose that the Germans would
be any more punctilious. It was a chartered
co. that first administered German New
Guinea, and in its constitution there was pre-
cious little ink wasted on humanitarian sen-
timents. One sentence, to be precise.
The Dutch have acquired a conscience of


late years in their attitude towards their 50
million brown and tawny subjects. The his-
tory of the unsavory past is steadily being
lived down. They feel no confidence in the
German when put in control of a people as
simply savage and defenceless as the inhabi-
tants‘of New Guinea, and they cannot afford,
with their own people demanding self-govern-
ment and sending representatives to confer
on policies of non-co-operation with Gandiii
in Calcutta, to have any fresh scandals in
their own back yard. Yet it may be that the
Dutchman’s fear of Japan and desire to see
his Outer Possessions profitably developed,
may overcome his patriotic scruples and
cause him to accept some compromise.

Rifle Clubs and Real Defence.
Care must be taken that the effort now
being made to boom rifle-shooting does not
defeat its own object, which may be pre-
sumed to be the effective defence of Aus-
tralia. For example:—
If there had been no civil guard in queer black
hats and queerer mufti to hold the Belgian roads
behind hurriedly dug trenches, Germany would have
swept into France and to the very shores of the
British Channel before it could have been stopped.
It is sought by enthusiasts to apply this
half-truth of the year 1914 to Australian
conditions nowadays:—
Let a force land anywhere in the country—and a
rifle club’s usefulness is doubly great in a sparsely-
populated territory—and a few hundred riflemen on
the spot, with a hundred rounds apiece, a careful
conservation of ammunition, a little generalship, and
a nasty-minded determinition to defend their homes,
can provide the most unwelcome kind of reception
for invaders.
This is merely a variant on Federal Labor-
leader Charlton’s foolery about "the strong
arms of Australia’s native sons” being suffi-
cient for the defence of the Commonwealth.
At the beginning of the World War a lot
of good work was no doubt done with the
rifle by Belgians—also by British, French
and Germans. But the aeroplane was then
in its infancy, the possibilities of the big
gun were not understood, gas had not made
its appearance, neither had tanks. In a
modern land invasion aeroplanes spy out the
defender’s strong points; five-nines or even
larger guns reduce the danger-spots to chaos ;
and tanks, which are impervious to any-
thing smaller than shell, go ahead. A modi-
cum of successful sniping at the men behind
the tanks would lead to the gassing of the
area suspected of containing the franc
tireurs. According to a cable the other day:
Professor Delisle Burns, of London University,
states that a new poisonous gas has been discovered.
It is invisible and odorless, but anyone breathing it
will die in agony between six and twelve hours later.
This gas, which sinks to the ground and will haunt
basements and subways for days, can now be produced
in great quantities. Against it masks afford the only
protection. Two tons of gas can be carried in an
aeroplane, and it will spread death for a quarter of a
mile around the spot whence it is. discharged,
For practical purposes Australia would be
defeated with the arrival of enemy warships
off its cities. We might carry on a guerilla
warfare for some months in various scat-
tered districts; but what would that avail
if the enemy held the coastal cities and the
waterways ? The only defence that is worth
a moment’s consideration, so far as Aus-
tralia is concerned, is sea defence. While
there is a fleet in being in this hemisphere
for the protection of the Commonwealth and
its trade, no one can come here witli sinister in-
tent without defeating that fleet: the moment
there is no fleet, any Power that possesses
first-class ships can smash our cities and
bring us to our The rifle-club move-
ment is an admirable one, but it is purely
supplementary. And there is a danger that
to boom it as a defence movement is to dis-
perse effort, and create a sense of false
security.

“Hands Up!”
The Brisbane police have just achieved a
signal success in a little conflict with the
Queensland Government. For the past year
or two there have been ominous rumblings in
the force over the question of pay, which, it
was alleged, was considerably lower than that
current in N. S. Wales; over the age of re-
tirement ; over the right of appeal against
promotion ; over one or two other matters.
A wise Government, if it wag not prepared
to fight, would have taken time by the fore-
lock and got in ahead of the disturbance;
but the Queensland Government, never very
wise, in this instance was very foolish. It
not only allowed the trouble to get up to
boiling-point, but halted and hesitated until
the Police Union announced its intention to
make a public demonstration by holding for
several days in succession a half-hour strike
during which no policeman would be on duty,
the striking constables to parade the streets
in procession, presumably as a testimony to
their loyalty to Law and Order. Very gen-
erously the union announced that it would
give the Government a day or two to weigh
matters —a piece of merciful consideration
impelled doubtless by the John Hops’ belief
that
While the lamp holds out to burn
The vilest sinner may return.
Events proved that the constables had taken
the Government’s measure quite correctly,
for in a few hours it was announced that,
after a conference with the Acting. Premier
and Home Secretary Stopford, so much of
the demands had been conceded that the
threatened strike had been abandoned, and
Police Union secretary Talty was able to
say that the result was “satisfactory on the
whole.” This kind of settlement, however, is
anything but “satisfactory on the whole” to
the general public. Of course it is in the
interests of the community that the police
should be well paid. The men responsible
for the maintenance of order protect every-
body, and we should be willing to pay for
our protection. But efficient police protec-
tion is based on the loyalty of the force, and
a force that strikes is not loyal, and a force
that threatens to strike is not loyal either.
To reward a body for announcing and parad-
ing its disloyal intentions is the readiest way
to breed further disloyalty; and the moving
spirits in the Queensland Police Union have
learnt the dangerous lesson that if they want
anything in future their best plan is to fly
the Red Flag of mutiny. This is not saying
that the demands of the police were unreason-
able But it does say that this method of
demanding and this method ot granting are
mischievous in the extreme.

A Short Way with Revolutionists.
“ J E ” wants to do something in time:
Every day for a week there has come fresh news
of trials and death sentences in Russia, the sentences
of death being interspersed with others imposing
long (often life) terms of imprisonment or exile.
The monotonous charge is that the suspects are
revolutionists —people who are dissatisfied with the
established government, which was also revolutionary
once They are not counter-revolutionists, or folk
who‘want to restore the old order, for the old order
is past all restoration. They are merely suspected
of having, or being likely to have, a desire to revo-
lush again, and New Russia has an even shorter
way with such than Old Russia had.
In that line it sets up a precedent which it
would be well for Australia to follow, not in a
wholesale way, but moderately and with discrimina-
tion. Australia has a system of government which
is much more worthy than Russia’s of jealous preser-
vation. Its supreme Legislature is the creation of
every adult citizen and citizeness in the land,
in fact, it is the creation of too many of them,
and an extensive weeding out for life of convicted
electors and el actresses would do much good. 1 Tac-
tically every citizen and citizeness is eligible to
sit in the supreme Legislature; and there also a
liberal weeding-out by an education and genera
test is overdue. This alii-Australian Parliament
holds all the power that the whole body of the
people care to . give it. The minor Parliaments,
despite the selection frauds of “uncouth crooks
and the like, are far ahead of the world’s average
in the matter of free popular choice and the free
admission of all and sundry a gieat deal too
sundry, in fact. Yet a vast conspiracy exists, and
is preached and avowed in newspapers and at street
corners and in Labor conferences and iff Parliament
itself, to take this self-governing power from the
nation by murder, rape, arson, robbery—in short,
by revolution and the wreck of the existing civilisa-
tion. Once accomplished the new disorder is to be
permanent. There is to be no going back and no
room for after-thought—say, through letting the people
have a free and effective expression of opinion every
third year. The example of the over rated Roiu.s-
I'lßiutß, who left the popular Assembly, sufficient
power to pull down his garish show, is a warning
that the really, truly gory revolutionist must go the
whole hog and abolish Freedom in Freedom’s name,
or else go out.
How numerous • the Communists (largely an im-
ported crowd) are in Australia can’t be judged by
the size of avowed Communist bodies, for the only
way to secure admission to the political Labor insti-
tution, and the loaves and fishes thereof, is not to
be avowed. Despite Red Objectives and such-
like furniture, Labor-leaders profess to be wonder-
fully particular about the company they keep. To
ask where revolutionists are bred is as futile as to
ask about the precise birthplace of the mob which
started to loot Melbourne at a moment’s notice when
it thought the law was temporarily paralysed by a very
partial police strike. Want of leadership and of time
to organise, and an unfortunate misjudgment of the
size of the opportunity, spoiled that little, revolution.
Still it showed that the necessary elements exist in
some quantity, and the subsequent efforts of peaeeful-
looking trades unions to boycott the volunteer police
who helped to put down the upheaval point the
same way.
I believe with gi-eat energy in the hanging of
persons who preach and plot revolution in Australia,
they being inciters to plain murder and other crimes.
They are all individuals whose admiration of Rus-
sian institutions and desire to transplant them here
amounts to a disease. The execution of revolution-
ists is a Russian institution, and fit for transplanta-
tion. I might be more particular about the evidence
than the Soviet is, but there is quite a gang against
whom the evidence of their own words has been piling
up for years, I also believe in deportation for life,
which I regard as a good thing and eminently bene-
ficial. But Australia makes an absurd fetich of “the
liberty of the subject,” including his liberty to be a
public nuisance and a public enemy. When a bad-
tempered and bad-mannered and bad-looking outsider
comes here to meddle offensively with our affairs, or
possibly to recruit for some civil war or insurrection
which is not our affair, more frenzy is therefore
raised about a proposal to send him back comfortably
than used to be made about the burning of a
heretic or two before breakfast.
The Australian Press.
W. A. llolman, ex-Premier of N. S. Wales,
talked last week on the congenial subject .of
the Australian press. Some of the tendencies
he deplored were discussed by The Bulle-
tin a couple of years ago. There is a Gres-
ham’s Law in journalism as in currency;
but experience shows that its application to
newspapers is qualified—at any rate, in Brit-
ish communities. That bad papers should
drive out good ones in certain markets is in-
evitable ; but the markets are not worth much,
as a rule. The section of the Australian
press which Mr. llolman assailed —it lias
been described as “run by morons for morons”
—is an inevitable result of that educational
system which he still presumably supports.
In a community containing practically no
illiterates in the strict sense of the word,
tastes in news are bound to be infinitely
varied. Some will like to read about home
and foreign politics, books and religious and
social questions ; others will favor intimate
details of crimes and outrages, interspersed
with what the Americans call “sob stuff.
It is the custom to compare the journals
which cater for the second class with London
Daily Mail, and Mr. Holman duly did it.
Yet the analogy does not hold. The big Lon-
don daily gained its huge circulation quite
legitimately—by providing a Continental
news service better even than that of the
Times, by condensing the rest of the news
without detriment to its value, and by cut-
ting the price in a part of the world where
every farthing counts. Australia has achieved
a few papers that bear a resemblance to the
Daily Mail : but it is only a superficial re-
semblance. Said tlieir critic: —
In their craving for sensationalism some of the
papers were becoming corrupted. A glance at them
would indicate that the cnly subjects in which Austra-
lians were interested were divorce, crime, political
scandals, and any sex subject.
But there is at least hope in the
fact that not one of them is a
financial success. It is a remarkable
tribute to the solidity of the Australian
character that, though about 95 per cent, of
the inhabitants above the age of 10 can read,
and that, though more than half live in the
cities where these sensational sheets appear,
there is no overwhelming rush for them by
either readers or advertisers. They sell briskly,
of course, when they have something excep-
tionally gory or spicy to offer; but the bulk
of their patrons belong to the class known
as “the straw-hat -brigade’’—individuals
whose exiguous incomes assist pony-racing
and s.-p. bookmaking rather than those in-
dustries that build up nations. The money-
makers are the oft-derided but balanced and
decent journals which are taken into the homes
of the people. When an ex-Premier repre-
sents the Australian press as preponderat-
ingly disposed to take to “a melancholy
form of mental prostitution” he is really
guilty of one of the very offences that he
alleges against the periodicals to which he
objects—he libels the nation. And when he
argues that “these guardians of the public
would themselves have to be guarded by
further restrictions than those already im-
posed by law,” he inspires sentiments of pro-
found gratification that he is no longer Pre-
mier. Australia is getting the press it wants,
and on the whole it is not at all a bad pi'ess.

The Redistribution of Seats Problem.
The defeat of the Victorian Ministry, led by
Peacock the Perpetual, over the redistribu-
tion of seats, shows that a deadlock is in-
evitable unless something happens to the policy
of preserving big States with a single big and,
ever-growing city in each State. A dilemma
has two horns, the same as a cow. In-the
present case the first horn is that it is
grossly unjust for 49,157 electors at Boroon-
dara to have only one member when 4820 at
Grenville have one also. The second horn
is that, if seats are redistributed on an
arithmetical basis, and if Congestion con-
tinues to congest, a time must come when
Melbourne and suburbs will have 63 members
and the country two, which would be ridicu-
lous. The management of pastoral and agri-
cultural legislation by city people who occa-
sionally week-end in the country isn’t man-
agement by experts. In some business-like
communities the difficulty has been got over
by making the bloated metropolis and its en-
virons a State by itself—not disfranchised
in the silly Washington fashion, which has
been copied at Canberra, but with its own
State legislature and the usual representa-
tion in both Federal Houses. Buenos Ayres,
with 72 square miles of territory, and Rio
de Janeiro, with 431, are two examples
among many. This method tends to oblit-
erate the representation problem, and it re-
lieves purely city men of cow and turnip
legislation. It might be necessary either to
transfer the railways to the Commonwealth
or to sell them to Private Enterprise in order
to prevent the accumulation of border diffi-
culties ; but there may be some other way-
out. Anyhow, some way. must be found, or
very valuable men like the Perpetual Pea-
cock will wear themselves out in a struggle
with the impossible.
Storm Clouds oil the Pastoral Horizon.
From a man deep in the business
Australia’s one outstanding achievement in the
economic sphere has been the production of a type
of wool pre-eminent in the world’s markets. Every
year buyers flock to Australia from all quarters of
the globe, and pay us high prices for this product.
Apart from quality, the quantity of merino wool
grown in this country, though diminishing alarmingly, .
is still enormous, and well in excess of that produced
by our most formidable rival. “The sheep will pay
the piper’’ murmurs the politician to his atrophied
conscience after every saturnalia of spending. And
in sonic miraculous manner the sheep does pay.
While every other form of primary production dis-
plays a deplorable disposition to get down on to
its belly, the sheep continues ton carry Australia's
financial burdens on its back. This has been the
case for so long that we have come to passively
accept it as a permanent arrangement. But is it ?
For the moment, abnormally high prices for almost
any kind of wool obscures the real state of affairs
from eyes no ways alert for rocks ahead. Figures
indicate that, not only are the total of sheep in
Australia diminishing, but the proportion of crosses
to the pure merino grows continually greater. The
figures for N.S.W., which is the chief sheep State,
show that in 1907-08 only 3.77 per cent, were cross-
breds. Ten years later the percentage was about
20 ; to-day it is over - 30. Add to the foregoing that
sheep in this State are only half as numerous as in
1891, and a very disquieting position is revealed,
only slightly improved by somewhat better figures for
W.A. and Queensland. The sheep in his profitable
capacity of wool-grower is being displaced by the .
sheep in his very unprofitable capacity of meat-
producer.
That Australia should attempt to rival the Argen-
tine as a meat-producing country is an absurdity
when the differences in distance from profitable
markets is taken into consideration. That she should'
attempt this at the expense of her wool production
isn’t an absurdity ; it is an insanity. The fact that
the meat industry has lately gone baggy at its
knees through begging indicates that something is
wrong. A person of logical mind might marvel that
Australian pastoralists should be replacing something
that does pay with something that doesn’t pay. But
it isn’t so much a case of pastoral myopia as of
political monkeying. It is the craze for subdividing
payable pastoral areas into unpayable fanning- areas
that has imperilled the purity of our flocks. The
small settler (and politicians. love to have him so
small as to be almost imperceptible) can hardly be
expected to care much how his few jumbuoks breed.
Of course, they don’t pay the poor devil; but after
he has done a short term on a Government block lie
would be surprised if anything paid him. But,
almost invariably, his flock, so far as they are any-
thing, are meat-producers as opposed to wool-growers.
Not only is the purity of our flocks imperilled by
the encroachment of assorted mongrels, but a likely
rival in the wool business, in the shape of South
Africa, has been making remarkable progress. Possess-
ing a vast scope of country admirably adapted for
the raising of merino sheep, and a near-by neighbor
who graciously supplies the pure strains (which her
people have taken many years of careful classing to
produce), the way of South African sheep-farmers
has been easy. “Undoubtedly within the next 20
years South Africa will be as great a wool-producing
country as Australia,” remarked a visiting sheepman
from the former country recently. He added that,
though South Africa had as yet only 30,000,000
merino sheep as compared with Australia’s 80.000,000,
“the farmers of the Union are still buying Aus-
tralian stock, and have been doing so for the last
25 years.” For his own part, our enterprising
visitor stated his intention of taking back 100
stud sheep and 200 flock rams when he returned to
South Africa. So while politicians are breathlessly
barracking with the harassed Old Man for a farthing
preference on a ton or so of dried currants, a
magnificent monopoly is slipping through our fingers.
It would be an easy matter to limit the exportation
of stud sheep to such an extent that this monopoly
would be safeguarded. Or, better still, prohibit such
exportation entirely. It is obviously useless to leave
the matter to the patriotism of individual pastoralists.
Anyway, few people worry about economic difficulties
that are not expected to appear until alter they
are dead, of out of business. But a nation must
take a longer view. It is a pity' to antagonise
anyone, but a country that is solicitous about safe-
guarding an ostrich monopoly should appreciate
similar astuteness on Australia’s part m the matfei
of merino sheep.

Will the World Go Piebald?
It is generations since the h rench had
that keen color sense which has always
distinguished the British and Germans, and
since the war any prejudice the nation might
have entertained against blacks seems to
have evaporated. Paris is the Mecca ot
British Indians and rich members ot >w
York’s African colony, as it is of wealthy
Tunisians, Algerians and other colored sub-
jects of Prance; and white Americans who
treat any of these people insolently m res-
taurants, first-class railway carriages and so
on are quickly put in their places by the
French authorities. It is not without sig-
nificance that all Prance’s world-fliers make
straight for Japan. The French have de-
liberately reversed the traditional policy ot
the white colonising nations in regard to the
colored races, and it is natural that the
most ambitious of these races should appreci-
ate the fact. In India for just on three
centuries the English have ruled as a
sovereign people, and to-dav their King is
Emperor, and in most of the States all the re-
positories of real power are white officials.
In Morocco the Sultan is supreme; his Min-
isters are his fellow-countrymen, and the
States are ruled (under him) by local chiefs.
The hand of France is there, needless to say,
in the shape of a Resident-General, but his
functions are merely to advise. v\ hat ail
these manifestations undoubtedly mean is
that in years to come the colored races
are not going to be merely tolerated m -he
centre of European culture; they are going to
be welcomed there. It is hard to blame the
French. National security happens to mean
more to them than racial purity, and with a
failing population they can look tor armies
only to the black and brown warriors- ot
their colonies. Unfortunately miscegenation,
once introduced to a continent, cannot be
compartmented. If France “goes black the
rest of Europe, not excluding the T inted
Kingdom, will eventually follow suit to a
greater or less degree. That will lea\ e Aus-
tralia as the one remaining white man s
sanctuary on the, earth. It is a splendid
destiny, but it remains to be seen it we die
worthy of it. If we weaken now, neglect to
defend ourselves militarily and economically,
the tide of color will inevitably sweep over
this country, too, in time.

“The Fanatical Disariner.”
“Sky Pilot” in reply to James Edmond
(B. 15/5/’24) :
The term “fanaticism” is always at a discount.
Yet why should it be? Without fanaticism this
old world rarely gets a hustle on. When some
ugly, lumbersome obstruction is in the path ot pro-
gress it takes more than an attitude of laissez-faire
to shift it; it demands fanaticism. Now, armaments con-
stitute the biggest obstruction tjiat to-day stands m the
way of the world’s peace and prosperity. Then why not
shift it 9 For the reason that people have a honoi
of being dubbed fanatical. The armaments obstruc-
tion has become a fetich, is fashionable, and, with
not a few, is profitable. But it is a diabolical evi ,
nevertheless, and diabolical evils are meant to be
destroyed. But for armaments the international
horror of 1914-18 would have been impossible. They
in a very true sense were the cause of the conflict.
Armies and navies had become blue-mouldy for a
fight. “The Day 1” was the ideal alike of navalism
and militarism. Realising, then, the provocative
nature of armaments, and the even more provocative
and perilous nature of armament rings, surely it is
no valid ground for insult if a man or party become
fanatical in order to remove it! Such fanaticism
may be the highest sanity, and the bravest patriot-
ism. .
What the world is waiting for is a nation sufficients
fanatical to blaze the disarmament trail. Gne * ueh
example by a leading Power would be sufficient. Sup-
pose England did it! Suppose she announced to the
world that on a certain date she would scrap her
navy and disband her army ; that henceforth she would
place her defence, not on force, but on honor, fairness,
integrity; that in all her relations with other peoples
she would act justly and honorably, not seizing their
territory, mines or oil-wells, and would restore those
which in the past she had commandeered! To pro-
ceed thus would be a venture, and from the conven-
tional viewpoint a mad venture, but for a nation
which has a national church, at the head of which is
the King, and which daily sings—
“ Sufficient is Thine arm alone,
And our defence is sure,”
to make the adventure would not be fanaticism; it
would only be consistency.
During the Great War it Was demonstrated that the
least-armed nation was the most secure nation, and
the most-armed the least secure. Armaments didn’t
save the nations, they damned them. K any nation
England, America, France —had the moral courage to
announce to the World a policy of total disarmament,
it might prove, not the insanity of fanaticism, but the
san ity of sound, sane sense. AVhat about an agita-
tion that the experiment be tried? The worst pos-
sible that could ensue would be but a trifle compared
to the hellish Armageddon promised us. in the “next”
war. But there is the pleasing alternative, the
experiment might prove a success. Anyhow, cock-
sureness against the experiment is but fanaticism in
another form.

The Shortage of Money.
Some pessimists talk of Australia falling
back into a state of barter because gold lsn t
allowed to circulate lest it should nee the
country and leave the Government note-
issue suspended in the air, and the Note
Board doesn’t supply enough paper to carry
on a growing business. The situation is
queer. When a bank grants Brown a
£50,000 overdraft, the same being smiths
deposit, and he uses it to buy goods or a
building or a squattage from Jones, and
Jones puts the money into the same or
some other bank, it is obvious that there is
£lOO.OOO owing and liable to be called for
—-£50,000 due to Smith and as much to
•Tones. If this happens very often, and the
bank can’t get any more money even by
offering full value for it, a time comes
when the bank becomris alarmed lest it
should be driven to commit an act of bank-
ruptev by announcing that it can t pay
some big cheque though it has piles of assets.
So it stops lending even when the security
is of the best, and as a matter of necessity
Robinson doesn’t put up the factory he in-
tended to, in consequence whereof JENKINS

remains out of work, and a general slack-
ness of business begins to be noticed. At
June, 1919, the joint-stock banks owed 249
millions to their depositors, and had 85i
millions of currency with which to meet de-
mands. At September, 1923, they owed 307
millions of deposits, and had only a little
over 291 millions of currency. By' this time
they had begun to sit on new ventures
which wanted assistance much as a despon-
dent elephant sits on eggs, and with much
the same results. The idea at the back of
the mind of the Note Issue Board is said to
be to gradually return to the use of gold, and
that is also said to be the proposition in
England. But the vision appears a long way
off, and many things may break in the inter-
val. Lately the Board is reported to have
refused to sell the banks more paper money
even in return for gold; and if gold won’t
buy paper there is something capsized in
the state of Denmark. The whole system
seems, at any rate, to be as stiff as a pipe-
clayed Prussian private of the olden time.

Wheat and Bolshevism.
Pkesident Coolidge, of the U.S.A., has
asked Congress to devise a way of helping
the north-western wheat-farmers, who are
rapidly losing their land to the local banks,
which in turn are going broke through finan-
cing them. The situation has various causes,
but a pair of big ones are: (1) Russia,
which was the world’s biggest wheat-grower
before the war (European Russia alone
came within a shade of being the biggest),
and also a very cheap grower, but which
raised only famines during the Bolshevik
madness, is coming back on a big scale; and
(2) the world had learned to raise almost
too much wheat without Russia. In this
matter a notable differ-
ence exists between Aus-
tralia and the United
States—a difference
which has prevented any-
one sending such a mes-
sage to the Common-
wealth Parliament as
Calvin Coolidge has
sent to his Legislature.
Here the wheat industry
leans very extensively on
the State Governments,
and the State Govern-
ments lean very exten-
sively on the public deb?.
All the railway depart-
ments, therefore, put a
disguised face on the
situation by hauling
grain at the lowest rates.
In 1920-21 the Ma State
carried wheat at 4s. 7d.
per ton per 100 miles,
while the average goods
rate, which was certainly
not more than sufficient,
was 9s. 2d. Next year
the wheat rate was' ss.
4d., against an average
rate of 11s. 6d. In
1922-23 the figures were
respectively ss. Gd. and
13s. 4d., so the difference
grew bigger, likewise the
subsidy. In 1920-21 the
secret donation which the
Department gave to the
wheat-raiser at the ex-
pense of the manufac-
turer, the pastoralist and
others was about
£794,000. Next year.
RELATIVE VALUES.
"Country hospitals, though subsidised by the State, are not requtred to provide Acommodation for
expectant mothe r s ; and very few of them do so."
MOTHER OF THE RACE: “You can afford to b wild a city for him, but you grudge me a bed”
there being an unusual lot of wheat,
ln 1922-23 it was
±7Io,UUO. That, plus some expensive sun-
dnes. is what the wheat-export business of
ptate has been costing to run lately.
Ihe interest on land settlement loans, raised
to put wheat-growers on the land before
they could begin to cost money in this way,
is a separate item, and not easy to esti-
mate. In the United States, where Private
Enterprise railways can’t subsidise any
class at the cost of the taxpayer, President
Coolidge apparently reckons that wheat-
raising for export has become, for the time
at least, a job for the cheap moujik. Per-
haps Australia would do well to decide simi-
larly, and resolve that it will also concen-
trate on manufactures, for which there is a
vast local market, and treat food-agriculture,
save under exceptionally favorable circum-
stances and save for local supply, as a sideline.
Propaganda.
My experience of this cruise is that the press news
we have received by wireless telegraphy has come
through Germany and France. It is a very serious
matter.”— Vice-Admiral Field.
It was discovered during the World War
that propaganda was as important as am-
munition. It is one of the offensives that
have been carried into the so-called peace
period, the reason being that all the great
nations are conducting a desperate trade
war. Cable and wireless propaganda—and
Australia is getting samples of both—aim
largely at discrediting or booming, as the
case may be, certain products; and the
methods employed are infinitely subtle and
varied. When Admiral Field says “it is
a very serious matter” that so much news
should be faked for Britishers by foreigners,
he is speaking primarily as an Englishman.
But this is aLo an Australian question.
Putting it on the very lowest ground, Bri-
tain has to maintain her trade in order to
buy our wool and other primary products:
and the more she is able to spend on food
and on raw products for her manufactures
the better fitted she will be to defend the
Empire of which the Commonwealth forms
a part. The abandonment of the Singapore
dock project means, as The Bulletin has
been pointing out for months past, that Aus-
tralia cannot be defended against any
Pacific Power possessed of capital ships.
That does not mean, fortunately, that we
are inevitably going to be attacked. Some
gambles are hardly worth the risk; and so
long as Britain remains mistress of the seas
an invader would have the unpleasant know-
ledge that some day—perhaps in a year,
perhaps in two or three—the R.N. would
have to be reckoned with under no such
fatal handicap as the Russian Fleet had to
battle against 18 years ago. But to remain
mistress of the seas in these strenuous times
it is necessary that Britain should not
merely remain rich: she must grow richer—
in other words, sell a deal more abroad than
she is doing at present. Individuals who
appreciate what is at stake may work to
good purpose in this direction. If one-tenth
of the energy were put into a campaign for
more British films, for example, that was
wasted on the futile “Dreadnought move-
ment” we would do a good turn to a great
English industry, and simultaneously benefit
ourselves. The principle can be applied in
countless other directions, for the British
make very little shoddy, while in a hundred
lines that we import they lead the world.
Another Menace to Australia.
A warning from a laboratory :
Looking back on the plagues with which the
human race has been afflicted, the outstanding social
consequences of malaria are clear. From the earliest
times the disease has played a major part in the
affairs of mankind, humbling empires, shaping the
destinies of nations and directing the course of
events. Although it is popularly believed to be
indigenous to the tropics, there is scarcely a country
which it has not ravaged. Where it originated is
unknown, but high opinion has placed its starting-
point in Egypt, whence the great trade routes carried
it into the four corners of the world. It seems to
have assumed its greatest virulence in Palestine and
Assyria, where it appeared as cerebral malaria, the
annihilation of Sennacherib’s host being attributed
to it. Thence it travelled to Greece, and by
Aristotle’s time had completely overrun that country.
At a later period it entered Italy, the focus of
infection being Sicily, which by 500 b.c. was defi-
nitely malarious. Its introduction into Middle Italy
took place at a still later date. In the beginning
the rural districts suffered much more than the
urban, probably because of the existence of the badly-
drained latifundia, or great country estates. By 400
b.c. it had become established in the swamps of
Latium; thence Rome itself was infected, and it
hindered the ccnduet of one of the Carthaginian
wars. Onward Latin literature teems with allusions
to the disease, and by the end of the Republic Rome
was suffering badly. Of the five major pestilences
which attacked the city between 433 and 392 b.c.
three were certainly malaria; and after them the
disease became endemic. From this period dates
that lethargy in Roman public and private life which
is so characteristic of the disease.
As trade increased and the Mediterranean civili-
saticns were extended malaria went with them, and
by tne tenth century there was scarcely a part of
Europe uninfected. Already it had brought about
the desolation of great cities like Tarentum, Metapon-
tum, Sybaris and Capua, and had assisted in the
fall of Greece and Rome. Rife in Germany, France
and England, it reached even Norway and Russia,
and in the infected districts hordes of dull-eyed, list-
less individuals, racked by chills and ague, lost
interest in life, so that agriculture and industry
diminished, tithes and taxes ceased to be paid, and
intellectual effort weakened. Later it spread to
America, ravaging wide areas and reducing the people
in them to mental and physical serfdom. Not' until
the advent of modem medicine was the first campaign
waged against it, scientific attack on an infected area
requiring an effort of which only national governments
are capable. Equatorial Africa is still in its
grip, while it constitutes the bar to social and
economic progress in many parts of South America
and the East Indies. The fight against it in the
United States costs the Government more than three
million dollars a year. In India it takes a terrific
human toll. It attains in Italy the dimensions of
a great national misfortune, impeding industrial
expansion and causing large tracts of rich land to
remain uncultivated. The economic wastage from
it is greater in a single year than resulted from the
Great War in five years.
There should be warning for Australia in
the fact that already the pest is within her outer
gates, and is sterdily gaining ground. With New
Guinea as its source, it first appeared on the Gulf
of Carpentaria while North Queensland was but
sparsely peopled. As population grew it gradually
came south, and to-day is close to Brisbane. In
N. S. Wales it is in the Northern Rivers district,
which 20 years ago or less were totally free. Stretch-
ing north from Sydney is ideal malarial country,
abounding in the anopheline carrier, with extensive
swamps and marshy areas. Let. it once establish
itself there, and Australia can postpone its dreams
of national greatness. Such happening would soon
result in the conversion of an energetic city, whose
boast is of its growth and progress, to one fever-
ridden and decadent, accompanied by an effect on
the rest of the nation more disastrous than would be
produced by the shelling of Sydney by hostile battle-
ships. Fortunately science knows exactly what to
do to fight back the menace. The national mis-
fortune is that we have not realised that it needs
fighting.

The discourse of “Bildad” :
I have a proposition to make for the uplift of
the mental calibre of Parliaments. When any
member or candidate states an alleged fact which
strikes anybody as sufficiently important and suffi-
ciently foolish to be worth taking up, it should be
competent for him to haul the speaker, at the
applicant’s expense, before a, court of competent
jurisdiction, and demand that he satisfy that august
body of the accuracy of his assertion. K he wholly
fails to do so he should be ordered to leave off mis-
leading the public, the penalty being £5O for each
repetition of the offence and more if there was too
much repetition. Thus a lot of silly yarns, invented
for bad purposes, and only tending to fill the land
with ignorance, would gradually pass out of currency.
To quote a conspicuous case. In the scheme of the
Red Objective element it is considered necessary to
get rid of State Legislatures and of the Senate. The
mode of enlisting outside sympathy is the constant
lie that this country has more Parliaments and more
Parliamentarians in proportion to population than
any other on earth. The statement should not impress
a schoolboy, and a moderate acquaintance with the
current record of the British Islands or the United
States, to mention only two examples, shows its
absurdity. Yet I have come across professors, a
bishop, various merchants, several landowners and
persons with ill-gotten titles who were prepared to
swear by the lunatic legend. My device would spike
that gun with ridiculous ease. It would also make an
end of the lie that the people of N.S.W. insisted
on the Canberra capital before they would join up
with the Commonwealth. And, more for the humor
than for the importance of the thing, I would have
turned the muzzle of the statute the other day on
Federal politician Gardiner, who said he had just
returned from Canberra and had found it a place
of delight, carrying 250,000 sheep, or one to every
acre. The latest available record says 150,000 sheep,
and even if there were the mythical quarter-million
it would be only one to over 2{ acres. If the
typical slummocky politician was liable to be hauled
up for being more of an inaccurate ass than usual,
and had to pass an examination in general knowledge
before he became a politician, and was deprived of
the “privilege” which allows him to be a hog m
the House without fear of the libel law, a new era
would begin.
♦-
“Capebtee” : It has for many years been
recognised that to net-fence and dig out is
the only really effective means of saving our
pastures from the depredations of rabbits.
Much political and importers’ capital is
sought to be made of the cry that the dump-
ing duty on netting is preventing or will pre-
vent landholders from protecting their hold-
ings against the vermin. The cry is insin-
cere. The pest is 40 years old. Why did
not those who are now complaining net when
netting could be had for less than £25 per
mile? Because they had a growl and an
excuse then, just as they have now—
and as some of them always will have. Com-
ing to the present day and prices (Austra-
lian, £43 17s. 6d. per mile; Anglo-German,
£41 19s. 6d.), are our graziers so bankrupt
of brain that they refuse to net because of a
difference of 38s. per mile, which represents
about a halfpenny per acre, when such an
improvement in a badly-infested area will
increase the carrying capacity of the land
by 50 per cent.? I know, for I have been
through the mill. By a deputation to the
Minister for Customs recently, seeking free
admission of wire-netting, it was stated that
only about 800 men were employed in the
industry in Australia, the inference being
that the number was so insignificant as to
be unworthy of serious consideration. I do
not dispute the figure quoted. But what
about the multitude of hands through which
the materials pass before reaching the net-
ting factory—producers of coal, iron, ore,
limestone, zinc, and the greater number who
provide food, etc., for their requirements:
quite an army before the materials even
reach the initial stages of manufacture? If
800 men are engaged in direct production it
is safe to say that a like number are in-
directly employed; and then there are pro-
bably as many occupied in the production,
transport and distribution of the necessaries'
of life for those 1600 and their dependants.
*
"Boubagi” whispers in Unc. Sam’s ear:—
A statement of the number of Yankee timberships
which annually scrape into east-coast Australian
ports through the forbearance of Davy Jones would
make interesting reading. These craft, usually four-
or five-masters, rigged fore and aft, are hurriedly
slung together with soft timber by Pacific coast
contractors. Then they are crammed with sawn
timber and more is piled on the decks. They carry
a minimum crew, even for fore-and-afters, and when
the dead cargo opens the green softwood planking in
the first heavy seaway, the craft becomes waterlogged.
Certainly the cargo keeps her from sinking, but the
crew has to spend its days on the deck cargo till it
is rescued or struggles into port, or dies of exposure
or starvation. Sometimes the ill-rigged and worse-
manned craft is dismasted, and sometimes she is
just lost and given over. There is hardly a month
without report of disaster or serious trouble to these
schooners. The Eric, recently arrived in Brisbane, is
a case in point. Meeting, heavy weather on Nov. £3
last, she filled and the crew roasted on the deck
cargo till Dec. 26, when she Was towed into Honolulu.
Successive helmsmen had to be lashed to the wheel
to prevent them being washed overboard. In Honolulu
it took three months to refit —or rebuild.
“Singemoine’s” character sketch :—
Most of the touts are tipping the imminent finish
of N.S.W. Attorney-General Bavin's political life.
The increasing virulence of the newspaper attacks
on him is ominous. These sheets will tell their
credulous readers, later, that they “drove Bavin from
public life as a menace to the Commonwealth,” or
blither to that effect. Actually, when the end comes,
it will be a case of jelo de se. Bavin is too
moderate to be a permanently successful politician.
He is a temperance enthusiast but not a prohibition-
ist ; a Protestant but not an Orangeman; an
Imperialist but no flag-flapper; a conservative-minded
lawyer and yet a sort of democrat. Add to these
disabilities an aggravating air of self-righteousness
and a genius for prolixity in public discourse, and
you get the reason why nobody loves him. He has
said that he will not put himself on the Bench, and
since he has spoken there need be no further argu-
ment on the subject: Bavin is the last man to go
back on his word. Yet he would make a good
judge. Not a great lawyer, of course: perhaps not
even a very good one. Rather narrow, and conspicu-
ously lacking in humor and the human qualities
generally; but as straight as a die, young and a
hard worker, and eminently the possessor of a
judicial mind. It is his judicial mind that is going
to be his ruin as a politician.

POLITICAL
POINTS
Nothing became Austin Chapman’s Minis-
terial life so well as his manner of leaving it.
He did not want office when Bruce took
over from Hughes. He was 59, a little
tired, not particularly strong, not ambitious
for a distinction he had enjoyed many times,
and in no need of the salary, being a rich
man with a richer wife. He came in partly
to reconcile the conflicting elements of the
coalition, and partly to place his profound
experience of the tricks of _ the politico-
parliamentary game at the disposal of the
brace of amateurs whom chance had made his
leaders. He is the most accomplished re-
conciler in politics. In this capacity he has
served the somewhat formal and chilly Bruce
with loyalty and success. But it is now in
the interests of the combination that he
should go. There were bitter heart-burnings
when the original Ministry was chosen.
Walter Marks said that, on reading the list,
lie felt “not as though one strand, but as
though two strands, of red-hot barb-wire had
been drawn across his eyes.” Pratten has
been making speeches on finance: Massy
Greene has drawn attention to himself in
the Melbourne and Sydney press. So Austin
Chapman, who in the House four days be-
fore his resignation made one of his most
vigorous tariff speeches, is stepping aside in
the invidious role of a physical wreck.
Some affidavits filed in the Commonwealth
Arbitration Court in connection with the
latest outbreak of the Seamen’s Union illus-
trate the nerve of these hardy longshoremen.
The row started with the imprisonment of
certain members of the crew of the Saros, at
Fort Pirie, for refusing to obey orders. When
they came out they refused to turn to again
unless they were paid for their time in the
jug. This is the merry jest, apparently, that
started the row which lias hung up a dozen
ships; and the appalling thing is that there
isn’t a Labor leader in the country game to
clout a union or a section of a union which
does such wicked things.
By 31 votes to 26 the anaemic Redistribu-
tion of Seats Bill, fathered by Alec Peacock
when Lawson missed his between the
Treasury bench and the Speaker’s chair, was
kicked out of Vie. Assembly. Angus, Fartli-
ing, Snowball and A. A. Billson (Gnashers),
Lind, Downward, Carlisle and Dunstan
(Cockies) and Jimmy McLachlan (Indepen-
dent) joined wdtli Labor’s 22 to give the
fledgling its quietus. Everard, another of
the Government’s candid friends, paired
against the bill, and McPherson, Barnes and
Pennington (three ex-Liberal Ministers) are
globe-trotting. This rebuff, coming on top
of reverses over the Speakership and the
Railway Committee appointment, confirmed
Peacock in the view that the House was un-
workable, and he began at once to make
arrangements for an appeal to the people.
Nobody will lament the squelching of a
Chamber which has been the flabbiest since
1889.
The recent Melbourne tramway trouble
had all the familiar marks. First, there is
the grievance—in this case an employee
invented a new rule to the effect that men
who serve as special constables during a
riot must not enter the tram service, and
was sacked for trying to enforce it off his
own bat. Next, there is the meeting at
which the Red and roaring section arrives
early and takes the prominent seats. Even
if it is a small minority it is apt to be taken
for a majority because of its noise. There-
upon the strike motion is declared carried by
a show of hands though only 25 per cent,
may vote for it. There is no secret ballot,
and the dazed majority, not really knowing
that it is a majority, and alarmed lest some
one should shout “Scab!” makes little or
no audible protest. The Red Flag pai’ty
Slopes to start its minority revolution on
exactly the same sort of bluff.
Lyons of Tasmania has been roaring.
While he was on his “gibbit tickpenny” mis-
sion on the mainland the churches lodged a
protest against the Government’s acceptance
of Tatt.’s proffered £lO,OOO lottery in aid of
the Speck’s hospitals. He put the acid on
their consistency, and reminded them that
when Lee was Premier he imposed a 2d. tax
on Tatt.’s tickets, took an extra 24 p.c. of
the prizes and 2\ p.c. on tote tickets, and by
these means got in £90,000 of revenue —and
the churches never said a word. From which
it does look as though what in Lee’s a
choleric word in Lyons is rank blasphemy.
Now that the atmosphere has cleared in
London, Queensland has a sketch plan by
which it is to borrow not more than
£2,000,000 a year indefinitely, or until it is
told to knock off. It is to get the money at
3 p.c., which, doubtless, means that J. Bull
is to help, provided he hasn’t too many other
troubles. Each year 2000 farmers are to be
put on the land owing £lOOO each in addition
to their shares of the Federal and State
debts. Curiously enough, some of the most
striking examples of closer settlement in Aus-
tralia had nothing to do with settlement
loans. Thus the population of Cumberland
county, outside Sydney and its suburbs, was
42 per square mile as far back as 1891, and
that was before any loan boom began. But
there was the centre of a State to help it;
which suggests that with more States, and
judiciously-planted seats of government in
these new States, other promising patches of
settlement might grow up and take care of
themselves without piling a burden of debt
on the settlers.
BREAKING UP THE GAME.
BRUCE: “You’ve been faking the throw: my city cobbers tell me .so.”
PAGE: “And my country pals say you’ve been pinching money from the ring. Suppose
we tell the lot to go to biases ?”
The Vic. Cabinet is to consider (some
time) a superannuation scheme for State
teacliors and the increase of positions above
class V. for those employed in elementary
schools —this at the earnest solicitation of
•Director Tate, who sees an impossible job
ahead. Certainly something will have to be
done, for the exodus of hefty, highly-trained
young peds. to the now far more attractive
police force is continuous; and the recent
awards to bank and insurance clerks con-
stitute another rock in the educational fair-
way.
These days a Sydney political doctor and
about two others write regularly to the
papers to point out that we would get im-
ported motor-ears, or brandy, or something
cheaper if the duty was taken off. In fact,
the news that p.c. of the population ot
Freetrade Britain is leading the jobless life
seems to have made a Freetrade revival.
This country certainly would get its brandy
cheaper if the Customs duty (and as a con-
sequence the local excise) was taken oft.
In fact, a lot of things would be cheaper if
all tariff duties were taken off; but whether
the cheapness would be any good to anyone
is another matter. Also, it would require an
extra tax of something over £2 an acre on
all cultivated land, or 6s. Bd. per acre on all
privately-owned land, to replace the lost
revenue. If factories gave up through im-
ports, and agriculture gave up through taxes,
something might turn up • to replace them.
But so far the political. doctor hasn’t sug-
gested what would turn up.
Though it is the British Liberals who keep
the Labor Government in office, the amenities
which pass between the two consist chiefly
of bricks and bottles. The nationalisation of
coalmines was a case in point. It was pro-
posed to confiscate the rights of the surface
landiord to collect royalties on the coal ex-
tracted, and the spectacle of a surface duke
collecting £200,000 or so per an. for fuel
which he didn't make or dig is aggravating
enough. But it was also proposed that the
Miners’ Union should elect half the Coal
Board which was to manage the business,
and the nation, including the Miners’ Union,
was to choose the other half. This mixture
of plural voting and job control roused Lloyd
George to hostility; whereupon a Laboritc
said the measure had been defeated “by a
hotch-potch of balderdash and puerility for
which a great political contortionist was
primarily responsible.” He would probably
have said more but for the limitations of
his vocabulary. Still, lie might have gone on
long enough to charge the ex-Prime Minister
with idolatry and dandruff.
Britain’s Ministry is up against another
problem. The coalminers want a basic wage
of decent size. Supposing peers and other
rich but dubious owners of coal-lands could
be broken of the habit of collecting a little
bit on each ton raised, it would help; but,
even so more than one-third of the output
goes abroad, and it is reckoned that the pro-
posed basic wage would close about enough
of the poor mines—for a time, anyhow —to
cripple this export trade. That would throw
many miners out of work; and the enhanced
price would also be the last straw on some
more of John Bull’s manufactures. The
Government might, of course, make the ex-
port trade unnecessary by protecting local
manufactures ; but apparently Britain would
rather starve than destroy its grandfather’s
god of Freetrade.
Before complying with Premier Peacock's
request for a dissolution of Vic. Assembly,
Governor Stradbroke went through the form
of “consulting” Prendergast, Labor Opposi-
tion leader, and Allan, the Cockies’ captain,
regarding the situation. The idea no doubt
was to stop Prendy from making another pro-
test about being ignored. He and Allan, how-
ever, didn’t mind the limelight—and neither
did his Ex., for that matter. But Strad-
broke gave the show away when he signed
a proclamation proroguing the Houses. If
he hadn’t intended to use the guillotine he
would, of course, have intimated that he
would take a day or two to consider the
“advice” tendered him, and let Peacock seek
a further adjournment of the Assembly.
Politics are more than half window-dressing.
A Melbourne man, Ernest Walker, has
suggested a trade balance tax; and the
thing has merits. His idea is that “as long
as the trade balance between TJ.S.A. and
Australia exceeds £11,000,000 p.a. in favor
of America, Australia should impose a tax
of 30 p.c. on all imports from the U.S.A. in
addition to the present tariff,” with a sliding
scale when the balance falls below
£11.000;000. Walker claims that the net re-
sult of a trade balance tax would be: —
(1) To encourage America to buy more of our pro-
duce.
(2) To encourage imports from countries prepared
to accept ours in payment, thus making as near as
possible an equal trade balance.'
(3) To encourage the manufacture in Australia of
many articles now imported.
And it ought to do all three.
About a political Rudolph Valentino: —
E. G. Theodore is the first Australian Premier to
be “written up” like a cinema star. He has
publicity agents in every capital, and most of them
are connected with sheets that are not usually
favorable to Labor. His contempt for Bruce, who
in most things is his antithesis, and for Charlton,
who cares only for the acclamations of his Party
press, is extreme. As a Federal politician he means
to find his feet under Charlton; and it is expected
that by the time he has done so the latter, who is
something of a sick man, should be ready to get out.
Then will come such an orgy of booming and
boosting from all sorts of unexpected quarters as will
cause visiting Yanks to inquire if Hearst has broken
loose in the land. These methods have succeeded so
far on the limited Bananaland stage; and nothing
but a miraculous access of intelligence on the part
of the public will prevent them doing so in the
larger sphere.
Shortly after reaching the Premier’s chair
in Victoria, Alec Peacock, recognising the
uselessness of the H.C.L. Commission, asked
it when it thought about committing the happy
despatch. It took the hint, and said it hoped
to finish its essay-writing in time to permit
of ordering the undertaker by June JO. Up
to date the inquiry has cost £2500, and
there has been one report (on bread), ana
another (on milk) is ready.
Old John Bull has ways that are some-
times peculiar; but he is capable of acts
which stand out magnificently in a self-
seeking world. There isn’t another nation
which has made such a showing in the
matter of war debts; and the other day
John unostentatiously jettisoned a cool ten
million pounds’ worth of war material which
might have been sold and so helped to lighten
the post-war burden. There were eager
would-be purchasers; hut the Cabinet, in
deciding that the lot should be destroyed,
laid down the principle that Britain is not
to supply belligerents with the hardware they
may want to throw at one another.
The “Majority Labor Party,” which is
mainly J. 11. Catts, ex-M.11.R., with P. C.
Evans, once secretary of the A.L.P., as his
lieutenant, threatens to be up and doing with
a heart for anything at the next N.S.W.
State elections. At the last Federal election
the “party” ran seven candidates, who consis-
tently finished nowhere : but it seemed to have
an amount of financial backing which was
surprising to those who did not reflect on
the possible value of vote-splitters in a tough
electoral campaign. Under the State sys-
tem the party appears to have less chance
than before; nevertheless it has sent out the
call for nominations from people who would
like to be candidates.
A small, anonymous wife, who deserved
to have her name cabled, leaped into notice
lately in London :
An astonishing scene was witnessed at the Labor
Women’s Conference, when a little woman, who said
she was the mother of 11 children, declared against
the' general teaching of birth-control methods among
working women. She aroused a storm of hisses.
Women on all sides cried dissent, but the little
woman stood her ground, and proclaimed her faith
in ringing tones. “What can be nicer than children?”
she asked. “The economic condition of the mothers
should be improved,” etc., etc.
The small, gallant female calls for much sym-
pathy, even though she left her tale less
than half told. No one will ever know how
many great and good men and women have
been lost to the world because they weren’t
allowed to he born. But any one can try
to guess how much sin and misery have been
found in the world through the rearing of
children who never should have been born,
and through these being allowed to have
children in their turn. Philanthropy has
much to answer for.
Maoriland has a scheme for spending
£11,000.000 on the development of water-
power. In this matter the Dominion is amaz-
ingly backward considering its opportunities.
It should have no need for coal save to
light isolated fires in lone places which hap-
pen to be short of timber, and to sell to ships.
But, according to a recent Year Book,, the
water-power used in 1922 was only 56,086
h.p., mostly for the furnishing of electric
light. But a list of “the more important
available undeveloped sources” covers nearly
two pages, and the force that is going to
waste is set down at more than 4,100,000
h.p. That represents five times the engine-
power used in all the factories of the Com-
monwealth : so there is no small asset run-
ning casually into the sea. Australia is sup-
posed to possess in Papua, not including the
mandated territory, ten million h.p. of water.
But Papua sounds some distance off.
There is something inspiring in the scheme
of a Victorian shindykit to do something
large in the way of producing motor-spirit
(of which 35,000,000 gallons per year are
now imported) out of potatoes. So far Austra-
lia’s luck in persuading oil to rush out of
the bowels of the earth has been nil; and the
greatest shale-oil enterprise in the Common-
wealth is apparently on its last legs, after
19 years of effort ami the loss of an immen-
sity of money. If matters go on like this
there is an uneasy feeling that Australia will
have developed into a full-blown motor-
fiend, helplessly dependent on imported sup-
plies. just when the great foreign oil countries
have become alarmed and begun to keep then-
supplies for their own needs.
REMEMBRANCE.

They heaped fresh blossoms about his l'eet
Five years in tribute for what was done
By those who died when their youth was sweet

For 21 years—down to 1907 —this was the
Citizens’ Life Assurance Co., Ltd. Then it
absorbed the Mutual Life Association, a
purely mutual office, and changed its name.
A couple of years later the Australian
Widows’ Fund, another mutual concern, de-
cided to throw in its lot with the other two.
The M.L.C. is thus an amalgamation of
three, and the reasons which prompted the
fusions and their results are matters to be
carefully considered, because every promoter
in the recent boom in assurance flotations
quoted the success of the M.L.C. as one
of the principal bits of evidence that his
own show would do well for both sharehold-
ers and policy-holders. Not one promoter
explained the true reasons of the M.L.C.’s
strength and affluence; probably most of
them are still ignorant of the years of
struggle—even of cheeseparing—-by ah effi-
cient management to reduce costs. Certainiy
with few exceptions the newcomers who
claimed that they could repeat the M.L.C.’s
performances have created expensive organ-
isations, sunk funds in magnificent offices
and in motor-cars, and in these and other
ways have so run up costs that they have
no hope of achieving for many years that
low expense rate which chiefly induced the
M.L.A. and Widows’ Fund to transfer their
businesses. Both these were highly respect-
able offices, but they had in some way lost
their punch, and were unable to get costs
down low enough to give policy-holders maxi-
mum value for their money. By 1907 the
Citizens’, which showed ordinary expense
rates of 8.1 p.c. on total income and 10 p.c.
on premium income, claimed that it was the
“most economically conducted life office in
Australasia’.’; at that stage the expense rates
of the M.L.A., after 39 years, were 16.2
and 22.4 p.c. respectively, and just prior to
amalgamation a couple of years later the
costs of the 38-year-old A.W.F. were 18 and
25 p.c.
The two businesses were taken over on the
undertaking, backed by the Citizens’ capital,
that costs would not exceed 15 p.c. of total
income. For the 12 months to December
last the M.L.C.’s rates for all transferred
business still in force, and the big volume
of assurances won since the amalgamation,
and including the outlay to write more than
31 millions of new policies for the year,
were 8.4 p.c. of total income and 13.3 p.c. of
premiums., These figures arc so much better
than the cost rates contracted for in the
agreements and allowed for in premiums on
other policies, and the mortality experience
has been so favorable, that surviving M.L.A.
and A.W.F. policy-holders are receiving
bonuses previously undreamt of: a compound
bonus (that is, a bonus on the amount
assured plus accumulated bonuses) at the
rate of 635. 3d. is being paid for the past
12 months, the cash equivalent exceeding the
amount paid in premiums by M.L.A. policy-
holders and giving 99 p.c. on A.W.F. pre-
miums. Meanwhile, the M.L.C.’s own policy-
holders are doing well: every £lOO of assur-
ance is credited with reversionary additions
of from 645. for a policy 10 years in force
to 84s. for earliest policies.
The £439,012 surplus of income over outgo
in the Ordinary branch last year took funds
to slightly more than 111 millions, and when
actuary R. D. Miller had valued liabilities
under policies, assuming in the calculation
that funds would in future earn only 3 p.c.
p.a., a distributable surplus of £498,596 was
available. The improved earnings of invest-
ments are nowadays* an important contri-
butor to profits. In 1914 the co. was earn-
ing £4 16s. Bd. on funds; for the past 12
months £5 2s. Id. (Ordinary £5 2s. Bd.; In-
dustrial, £4 19s. 2d.). On total present funds
and capital that improvement alone gives
£37,500-odd more annually than 10 years
ago. The management continues to invest
heavily in public securities: no less than
87.1 p.c. of all assets are gilt-edged, and to
help purchase them nearly 3rl millions have
been borrowed. Put another way, the eo.
has invested about five yeai*s* anticipated
surpluses in advance, and no doubt a nice
profit is being won in the difference between
the interest on borrowings and the returns
from the investments. How aggregate
balance-sheet figures have altered since 1014
is shown by the comparisons which follow:

The expense rate last year was 30.3 p.c. of
total income and 37.7 p.c. of premiums. In
this department the rate of future interest
assumed in the valuations is 31 p.c. for poli-
cies 14 years in force and under, and 4 p.c.
on older policies, against almost 5 p.c. actu-
ally earned and likely to be maintained for
many years. So in the £2,080,577 net lia-
bility estimated by the actuary there is a
large contingency reserve. That valuation, as
at December 31, was £67,201 less than funds,
the whole of the surplus being available for
shareholders. The M.L.C. Industrial policy is a
definite contract: the eo. will pay no more
than the amount assured, but its paid capi-
tal is a guarantee that it will do that much.
The proprietors are,- of course, not taking
the last penny from this business; besides
inner reserves which have been steadily de-
veloped by assuming a lower rate of interest-
earning than is probable, the valuation pro-
vides for numerous contingencies, thus mak-
ing the business thoroughly sound and mini-
mising any risk to which capital may have
been exposed. Besides their cut from Indus-
trial operations, shareholders can take up
to one-fifth of Ordinary profits : put another
way, before the proprietors take a pound
they must have earned £4 for policy-holders.
But that they can get that pound is a prac-
tical encouragement to carefully supervise
every corner of the business, and a guarantee
for policy-holders that the proprietors will
insist on efficient management in future.
One feature of this co-operative office is that
the policy-holder has direct representation:
M.L.C. policy-holders, as well as the old
M.L.A. and A.W.F., have no less than seven
trustees, who employ their own actuary
IT. \Y. Bremner ) to watch their interests;
and though the trustees have no voice in the
management, they are invited to, and regu-
larly attend, Board meetings, and the man-
agement is obliged to publish the trustees’
reports, in uncensored form, with the annual
accounts.
The big business is doing so well that
shareholders are receiving very handsome
divs. Last year £63.839 came from the Ordi-
nary branch (slightly more than 13 p.c. of
the profits ' divided) and £71,161 from the
Industrial department. Paid capital is
£200,000, apd altogether shareholders received
£135,000: a return of 67$ p.c. to the originals
—if there are any of them left. *

The solid crowd behind this young Austra-
lian insurance co. are not bothering about
divs. yet, though in only three years the
£30,734 of reserves which have accumulated
after debiting preliminary and business-
extension charges are £7357 more than is
required by a 40 p.c. reserve for unexpired
risks. All profits are being stored to
consolidate the business and to < .tend its
field. Besides having opened branches in
four States of the Commonwealth, more than
a score of underwriting agencies have been
established in the Near and Far North, in
Canada, India, .West Indies and elsewhere.
Colombo. Montreal, Vancouver, Sourabaya
and Chefoo were added to the list during the
past 12 months, and the Victorian connec-
tion was strengthened by adding H. V.
McKay, George Tallis and Clements Lang-
ford to the local Board, which had previously
consisted of Wm. Mcßeath and Speaker W.
A. Watt. Underwriting performances for
the three years have been as follows

1924.. 58,442 33,296 20,172 56.9 „ 34.5 „
Altogether £120,849 of net premiums have
been collected for an expenditure of £44,639,
which has included all establishment and
organisation outlay. The reduction of the
expense rate last year to only a trifle more
than one-third of the net premiums was a
very creditable performance. Lately the
Bankers and Traders has shared the general
experience of heavier loss rates, but as it is
dealing in selected risks only it closed its
accounts for the past 12 months with £4974
of underwriting profit. Interest returned
£5629, making the total surplus of £10,603
shown by the introductory table.
Paid capital is now £87,600, in 175,200 £1
shares paid to 10s. Last year 19,700 new
shares were placed in quarters likely to
influence new business. The features of
the enterprise, apart from the rapid growth
of underwriting, have been that (1) no
brokerage or promotion charge was made at
flotation; (2) all development and estab-
lishment expenses, even office furniture and
stationery, have been debited against revenue.
Consequently, every penny of capital and of
general and underwriting reserves is repre-
sented by first-class assets. The balance-
sheet total of £140.780 at March 31 was
made up as follows: Public securities,
£93,124; deposits and cash, £35,534; sundry
debtors, £2096; outstanding premiums,
£3998; and branch and agency balances,
£6028. Such good-quality investments alone
give a nice return on capital, so, as the
business develops and losses become normal,
there are bright prospects for shareholders.
Besides having accumulated reserves in excess
of the amount required to re-insure unex-
pired risks, the co. is a solid underwriter in
another respect: paid capital and reserves
together exceed twice last year’s net pre-
mium income, funds thus being one-third
stronger than the generally-accepted safe
minimum backing for insurers. In addition,
shareholders can be called on to put up
£87,600 more.

Compared with the previous best (192.1),
earnings were up £2952, and outgo was
£1590 less. One corner of the business in
particular finds conditions easier than they
used to be. Until a few years ago Permewan
Wrights ran a fleet of packets on the N. S.
Wales south-west rivers against fierce com-
petition. In 1919 the various river fleets were
amalgamated in Murray Shipping, Ltd.,
which has a paid capital of £21,600 of 6 p.c.
prefs. and £43,200 of ordinaries, and P., W.
and Co. holds £IB.OOO of shares. For the
past three years 10 p.c. p.a. has been paid
on ordinaries.
After spending £2812 on repairs, writing
off £4IOO for depreciation (these two items
together taking £2525 more than in the pre-
vious year), and setting aside £2750 for
taxes, the past year’s net profit gave 19}
p.c. on paid capital. So, though the div.
rate has been lifted to 12* p.c., there has
been a substantial lay-by. With the assist-
ance of new capital—£2s,ooo raised four
years ago increased it 50 p.c,—the eo. has
in recent years made a good recovery from
the troubles which hindered it for a long
period after the 1902 drought. After a run j
of losses, £12.500 of capital was written off.
and the div. rate on the reduced capital did
not get above 6 p.c. until 10 years ago. and
10 p.c. was not reached until five years back.
Meanwhile, however, when opportunity
occurred, the directors safeguarded the future
by putting big slices of profits into the ice-
chest. There are now visible reserves of
. almost £58,000 to assist £75,000 of capital.
■ These reserves and the new funds put in by
shareholders have kept liabilities down

The £56,242 of liabilities at January 31 were
made up as follows: Deposits, £4777 ; sundry
creditors, £47,921; overdraft, £3544. Book
debts, stocks and cash assets totted
up £149,338, giving a £93,096 surplus of
liquid assets over and above liabilities. De-
ducting the final div. the liquid surplus still
amounted to £87,471, equal to 235. 4d. per
255. share paid to 20s. Provided the book
debts are all they seem —and the manage-
ment appears to have protected those
accounts and other book values by internal
reserves—shareholders’ investment looks
solid. The book value of fixed assets is 13s.
per share. With ordinary luck and, of
course, a continuance of good management,
the co. seems equipped to do well for share-
holders. The scrip is closely held, and is
seldom dealt in ;. the last recorded sale was
at 255. in July last, but a. buyer offering
the same figure lately lias been _ scorned,
though it would give a good profit to old
hands and to buyers in the dull years—
scrip was picked up at 14s. only seven years
ago—who took their portion of the new issue
at par. Any one year’s profits must not be
taken as a guide to prospects; it is an erratic
business in which earnings depend on sea-
sonal conditions. So to get a line on possi-
bilities it is necessary to average results over
a period. Net profits for the past four years
have averaged 15 p.c. p.a. on £75,000 of
capital.

Down to 1920 the Wickham and Bullock
Island office regularly each year showed how
much had been laid aside for depreciation,
but for four years only the net profits have
been disclosed. No doubt adequate allow-
ance is made for wastage of mines and plant,
because this is one of the coal cos. which
iiad a bitter experience when the Newcastle
pits were worked out: no provision having
been made for a return of capital it nar-
rowly escaped liquidation by pressure, from
the expensive prefs. (they carry 12J, p.e.
p.a.), and a recovery was effected only by
the co. picking up choice sections of the
Maitland field at bargain prices. Just prior
to the time when the introductory table be-
gins, all profits were being absorbed to pay
off 11 years’ arrears of pref. divs. The reason
depreciation transfers are not now disclosed
is probably because tlie directors have taken
advantage of a favorable run to stow away
more than seems necessary. The published
accounts still record gross sales (£168,537
for the past 12 months), but all expendi-
ture and various provisions are lumped in
one entry (£154,980). The difference
(£13,557) was the net profit, but though that
gave a good margin over and above the cus-
tomary divs., by comparison with the
£32,841 shown for 1922 there would appear
to have been a serious falling-off. However,
this co.’s directors report that trade was
normal during the year, and “the co.’s pro-
duct continues to find a ready market.” It
is probable, therefore, that net earnings were
much bettor than the disclosed figures.
Lately the management has had employment
for all funds it could lay hands on, because
since 1921 it has been developing and equip-
ping a new colliery, the Kalingo.
In a previous 12 months the book value of
mines, railways and plant jumped from
£62,685 to £176,942, and meanwhile a £78.615
surplus of liquid assets was converted into
an excess of liabilities amounting to £11,507.

ment decided to go outside for the money:
against £9320 of debts at March, 1921, 12
months later the co. owed £59,976 to sundry
creditors, and had raised £51,230 on deben-
tures. At the latest balance the former
item was down to £56,230 and the debenture
account to £49,236. However, against the
latest total of liabilities (£105,466) were
Government securities and mortgages for
£24,141, book debts for £26,065, deposits and
cash totalling £50,413, and £3106 of stocks
and stores. All these liquid items fell only
£1741 short of outside debts.
Had the co. been put into liquidation 20
years ago, ordinary shareholders would not
have had a penny returned to them. But
operations at the Neath colliery, and
subsequently at the Cessnock, have proved
so remunerative that without calling up
any new funds from shareholders the £20,000
of prefs. and £90,000 of ordinaries have be-
come represented by three well-equipped col-
lieries on a first-class coalfield, and for 10
years a good average rate of div. has been
paid. As debts exceed liquid investments
by only £30,000, and that amount is almost
covered by customers’ balances, stocks and
stores, div. prospects look very rosy. The
£1 ordinaries, which at one time threatened
to become valueless, are nowadays fetching
at least 335. in the market. At that price
the 10 p.c. divs. return only 6 p.c; but the
market is banking on a sum in simple pro-
portion : if one colliery could pay divs. of 10
and 12J p.c. 10 years ago, how much should
three now pay on the same capital? The
doubtful factor in these calculations, how-
ever, is the future of the coal trade;
lately the mine-owners and the unions have
had things all their own way, but the recent
threats of the miners, the serious curtailment
of the export trade, due to strikes and high
prices, and, not least, the competition of all
the new mines which have been opened up,
may make profit-earning less easy. How-
ever, things would have to go badly with this
co. if from three collieries producing high-
grade fuel it could not give reasonably good
divs. on £90,000 of ordinary capital after
finding £2500 p.a. for prefs.
* * * •
Westralian prospectors were under the im-
pression that they would obtain some relief
from taxation of their hard-earned windfalls
from the sale of mines, but they are being
disillusioned. One reason given for taxing
cash and shares received in a recent sale was
that the unfortunate outbacker was not a
“prospector” under the Act, because he did
nothing else but prospect, and therefore made
a “business” of it. Just before the Hamp-
ton Plains boom started one of the genuine
old-time prospectors who had suffered hard-
ships for years, with starvation results,
pegged several blocks, which he sold for £6OOO
cash and 30,000 vendor shares. The latter
were worth practically nothing six months
later, nevertheless the tax-collector demanded
£SBOO. He made a reasonable offer, but it
was refused. Finally he folded his tent and
silently stole away, and the West thus
lost one of its best prospectors. Another
case is that of a speculator who stood tucker
to a deadbeat on the same field, and in return
was given an interest in a lease which
brought him £SOO and a swag of the usual
unsaleable scrip. The taxation people billed
the speculator for £9BO, and at that figure he
reckoned the tucker had cost him £5 per meal.
* * * *
Hampton Properties (W.A.) gives details
of its reorganisation. The co. is at present
registered in England and has offices in
London and Edinburgh, although most of the
work is done by the latter. The Board now
proposes to close the London office and regis-
ter a co. in Scotland with a capital of
£130,000, in 650,000 4s. shares: 436,317 fully-
paid will be issued to shareholders in ex-
change for shares now held, and they will be
offered 100,000 more at 4s. each. The new
issue, which will provide £20,000 additional
working capital, has been fully underwritten
free of any cash consideration, but the under-
writers have a 12 months’ option at par on
50,000 of the 113,683 reserve shares. The
co. had a surprise recently at its Mt. Martin
mine, Hampton Plains; preparations were
being made to shut down, when a new run of
payable ore enabled operations to be con-
tinued.
* * * *
Hampton Celebration (W.A.) may yet
succeed. In the bottom workings at 400 ft.
prospects are very fair, and the Mines In-
spector considers that the shoot will live
down and ultimately be a source of profit to
shareholders. A little milling is being done,
but there cannot be much profit in opera-
tions.
*** , *
Brilliant (W.A.), having taken an option
on Gnow’s Nest, and being short of funds,
has asked the Mines Department to help it do
work estimated to cost £BOOO. Minister for
Mines Troy is agreeable to assist, provided an
independent report on the show, is favorable,
and provided the co. finds its share of
the cash. An expert examination will prob-
ably reveal that the old. owners, were wise
when they refused to sink their profit in
further development.
* * * *
Lanarkshire’s option at Waverley (W.A.)
has been visited by the chairman, who de-
dares that it is a very valuable property.
Assays ranging from au ounce to 26dwt. are
mentioned, and there is talk of crushing
when the neighboring State battery has been
repaired. So far, however, development is
very limited, and mining men of experience
doubt the permanency of the lodes.
* * * *
“Peter”: There is one Westralian “pros-
pector” who makes a crust easily. Under
the Mining Act the registered holders of a
lease are jointly and severally liable for all
expenditure, and this man works the law to
the letter. He pegs an area and makes
application in, say, 240 shares. That is
all he does in a mining way. The next
move is to Perth, where he sells shares and
promptly registers the holders in the Depart-
ment. Then back to the lease, where six
months of cakes and ale are punctuated by
glowing reports. Next comes his divvy: a
demand for six months’ wages. His part-
ners squeal loudly at first, but have to pay
in the end. After settlement, the shares are
generally surrendered, are re-sold, and thus
the game goes on. Moral: Don’t enter into
mining partnerships except as a shareholder
in registei’ed cos.
* * * *
Development of the Mt. Isa (N.Q.) field
has reached the stage of disclosing how some
of the lodes behave as they go down. Mt.
Isa Mines, Ltd., is sinking 15 shafts spread
over six of its blocks, and the most import-
ant find so far has been in a crosscut at
85ft., which has penetrated 6ft. of good ore
and gives promise of a 12ft. to 14ft. lode.
Sinking and crosscutting are being pushed
ahead ; and though months of work is neces-
sary to determine the prospects of the field,
already the evidence confirms the early
opinion that Mt. Isa is the Commonwealth’s
best-looking silver-lead find since Broken
Hill. Under Government Geologist St.
Smith, who was loaned to the co., and W.
11. Corbould, Mt. Isa Mines, Ltd., which
holds a large slice of the field, is being
systematically explored without any trumpet-
ing. Nevertheless, the £2O-paids this week
passed £5O in the market, with few sellers.
Manager Rodda, of the Proprietary, declares
that three of his co.’s blocks are “certain-
ties,” but on the amount of work done that
description may be premature.
* * * *
“Cuzenos”: It is probable that the Mt.
Isa (Q.) lodes were known long before
Campbell Miles discovered their value. In
the copper boom of 1907 Harry Curel
brought in some substantial specimens of
galena which he exhibited in the bar of his
new hotel. Nobody seemed particularly in-
terested, as copper was then the only metal
considered worth while. Curel reported that
his discovery was made near the Wee McGre-
gor Mine, which is only about 35 miles
from Mt. Isa. Curel became a confirmed
invalid, and had no opportunity of following
his prospects.
* * * *
The first crushing for many a day on the old
Palmer goldfield (N.Q.) will be put through
shortly by R. J. Watters’s syndicate. About
90 tons have been raised from the Louisa,
and are expected to bulk 3oz. to 4oz. The
Louisa is down 100 ft., and work has been
started on the Comet and the King of the
Ranges. The syndicate, with assistance
from the Mines Department, has carried on
for several years in the face of tremendous
difficulties, due chiefly to the isolation of the
field and heavy water on the lodes. How-
ever, a battery, steam winding-plant and
pumps are now in trim, and the syndicate
can go ahead with development. Heavy
water, high expenses and faulty management
downed the last effort to open up the Palmer
lodes.
* * # *
The main Eclipse reef at Brookfield, near
Brisbane, is showing up promisingly with a
couple of feet of good mineralised ore at
60ft. The new Bft. reef is a dud; it ap-
pears to be made up of only hungry quartz
leaders on a crosscourse which faults the
main reef. The main reef will average 10
or 12 inches of quartz for 50 feet; and
although values are in and out the average
is certain to be good, as the pyritic vein is
rich. The co. intends to sink to 100 ft. and
prove a solid block of backs before spending
money on chasing the faulted lode. All future
work depends on present development proving
satisfactory. The ore is refractory, and treat-
ment of it has not been an unqualified success.
There is no doubt, however, that the gold
can be recovered —probably 90 p.c. of it—
and at latest the old reef was looking decid-
edly healthy, although on the small side.
* * * *
The Queensland coal trade is very quiet.
The Blair Athol, most of whose local trade
has been filched by the Baralaba and Styx
mines, is issuing 50,000 10s. contribs. to
complete the open cut. The fate of the co.
depends on the success of this move, and on
capturing coastal bunker and export busi-
ness. The Bowen River coalfield is also
having a dull time, and capital is not yet get-
ting much of a spin on the present output
and tonnage costs. Styx No. 2 is turning
out the best coal in the State, but probably it
is being won at very high cost, because the
seam is still in contorted country.
There has been talk for some time of an
unusual gas blow at Tarome, to the north-
east of Roma (Q.). L. C. Ball has investi-
gated it for the Mines Department. His
samples show more than 80 p.c. methane, but
none of the precious wet gases. Their
absence and the occurrence of the gas in the
Walloon coal measures, the geologist says, do
not encourage prospecting for oil.
* * * *
Dereks, Ltd., at Stannary Hills (N.Q.),
has closed down its tin-mines, throwing about
60 men out of work. The co. has been sin-
gularly unfortunate; but it has been work-
ing low-grade ores. March crushing was
760 tons for 11 tons 7cwt. cones., worth
£1875, and averaged under 50s. per ton. The
April crushing of 400 tons dropped to the
vicinity of 40s.
• * * *
The New Ristori, at Allendale (Vic.),
after about two years of call-paying, has got
on to payable wash ; sdwt. values in the drive
are accompanied by black sand and decom-
posed vegetable matter, both considered favor-
able indications in that section of the Bal-
larat district. Where the Government bores
bottomed no wash was got; it proved to lie
about 20ft. below. Later, when the mine was
flooded, the Government turned a deaf ear
to appeals for assistance; but shareholders
remained faithful, and put up the money for
unwatering and for searching for the elusive
lead.
* * * *
Ajax North, Daylesford (Vic.), has had
a better run: 676 tons have given 3510 z., an
average of nearly and 2dwt. better
than the previous month’s average. The
mine is looking so much better that share-
holders are again dreaming of divs. During
the past 12 months much prospecting has
been done by manager Hansen; his drives
and crosscuts for that period measure up
about 1900 ft.
Boola Boola Petroleum and Natural Gas
Co. (Vic.) is having a bad spin leading
up to a likely nose-dive. Latest accounts
show only £6l cash in hand; and 17,631 of
31,000 shares issued were forfeited for the
tenth call of sixpence. Plant, casing, build-
ings and boring to 990 ft. have cost £19,902.
Sands have intruded 500 ft. up the borehole.
The over-reaming of the well was a triumph
for Chris Gleeson, the foreman, because the
job was exceptionally difficult. The plant
is a good one, and the casing, much of it
unused, is a substantial asset, so the posi-
tion is not absolutely hopeless. Boola Boola
was the pioneer Vic. co. to drill for petro-
leum. To raise additional funds the for-
feited shares (paid to 18s- 6d.) are being
offered at 9d., but even then so little cash
will be available that prospecting cannot go
much further. Anyway, the first hole has
apparently gone down in a syncline, or
trough, and, cannot be expected to do more
than determine possible future work. Cab-
bage Garden oil-shows are no longer in favor,
and the prospects of raising new capital are
bad.
* * * *
Christmas Gift, Cootamundra (N.S.W.),
has encouraged shareholders a little with a
return of 3060 z. from 200 tons. Most of the
stone came from the stopes off No. 2 winze
on the Federal lode, below the 200 ft. level;
but the sweetening was from 3ft. of lode in
the winze on Baulderson’s reef at 200 ft. It
was the fruitless search for this formation
at the 300 ft. level that caused the collapse
of the market last year. The show is a
patcliy one, and has failed to live up to its
early promise.
* * * *
The high price of lead has put the Mag-
net (Tas.) on the div. list again: the old
show has distributed 2s. per share. To main-
tain it in the dull times was costly, but the
Launceston 'Harts, having cash galore and
faith in the show, kept the flag flying. Only
7152 tons were required to provide profits
for the divs. Most of the ore was broken
from No. 11 level down to the No. 14. No.
13 shows signs of wear, but from No. 11 up
to No. 9 big blocks of seconds remain to be
broken. Both south and north, at No. 14
the country is more or less faulted, but floors
of fairly good ore over a good width of the lode-
channel have promise. Manager Hales, try-
ing to find a new mine off the adit level,
has struck kindly country and a few splashes
of galena. He will go west to see if ore
lies there. His all-in costs last term were
52s 9d. per ton, of which the smelters took
235. lOd. The little parcel sent away con-
sisted of 1005 tons crudes and 475 tons con-
centrates ; contents were 95,9180 z. silver and
597 tons lead. The ‘;wo divs. took £5136 of
a net profit of £7050. The co. has £8904 of
cash in hand, and stocks and ore in transit
are valued at almost £6OOO. Current debts
amount to £3559. Hales is satisfied he
has more than an ordinary mining chance in
the north-west crosscut off No. 14 level, and
there are fair-sized reserves at Nos. 9 and 10
levels, so the immediate future of the show is
bright if lead prices hold.
* * * *
The slump in tin may make it hard for
Mt. BischOff Extended (Tas.) to go ahead
wiGi its works programme. Last six months
operations resulted in a loss of £3249, and
the metal has since dropped more than £5O
a ton. Extended’s lode is rarely wider than
ISin. It is proposed to lease power from
Mt. Bischoff, thereby cutting down the fuel
bill. Its big neighbor also allows the Ex-
tended to work its Wheal block, to the boun-
dary of which the Extended’s levels have
already been pushed. To get cash for elec-
trical equipment, nominal capital is to be
increased from 10s. to 20s. a share, and
2s. 6d. is to be called in. In 57 days’ work
the battery treated 3387 tons for 33| tons
oxide averaging 66f p.c. tin ; but the general
impression is that Extended is a has-been,
and, like its old neighbor, needs a miracle to
rejuvenate it.

“Blue Bar”: Some queer people apply for
the immigration concessions at Australia
House. One such recently wandered in, and
was asked to fill out the usual form. One
question was: “Born?” There was a space
left for the name of the birthplace to be
filled in, and the would-be immigrant was
noticed to be much worried over this ques-
tion. After a lot of thought and _ half a
dozen attempts he filled the space m with
one word : “Yes.” #
“Derf Commor”: The Northern climate

in an assault case, the evidence showed that
defendant, on coming home unexpectedly, had
found his wife in the arms of the plaintiff,
and feeling hurt had thrashed the intruder.
The outraged Adam was 72, the erring Lve
65, and the Serpent 83.

“Wilfrido”: At the suggestion of the police
a young M.L. society man contemplates sign-
ing the pledge. In the afternoon preceding
a fancy-dress ball he fell in with a party’ of
bachelor cronies, and some hours later fell
out of the hotel which he had entered in
their company. On his arrival home ms
wife saw that his condition was impossible ;
but after coercing him into bed she decided
to slip into her own fancy frock, and at
least put in an appearance at the dance.
Her return coincided with the exit of two
angry policemen, the more controlled ot
wliom told her that they had been sum-
moned over the ’phone by her husband, and
asked to evict a man from her bedroom. The
husband, it seemed, had found his way into
his wife’s room, and there been stung to
action by the derisive silence that greeted
his expostulations at the strange man’s
clothes laid out on the bed. It was, he after-
wards remembered, the costume in which he
was to have gone to the ball.

“X.N.0.” : In reply to “Skipper’s” inquiry
as to what has happened to the lamp which
once hung in the late lamented Australia’s
wardroom as a pipelighter, I imagine that it
has been “returned to store.” Long before
the war a Colomb’s lamp, with the glass re-
moved from one side, was often to be found
hanging in smoking-rooms at sea. “Pusser’s
Dips,” as the sailor calls the naval brand of
candle, were cheap, and this method of econo-
mising matches has been in use in the service
to my certain knowledge for over 20 years.
This particular kind of lamp was a heavy
brass affair made in several different patterns
and invented by Admiral Philip Colomb. It
served much the same purpose as a hurricane-
lamp, and was hard to blow out in a gale.

“S.T.S.”: The misfire of “Hamer” (B.
17/4/’24) who laughed heartily at the im-
probable name of Binks, “and the stranger’s
name was Binks,” recalls an experience of
my own. My trouble was with “Jones, of
Gumeracha,” an imaginary person, who
stands in my mind for the average citizen,
the Man in the . Street. I was explaining to
a lady the need of advertising for claims
against her father’s estate. It seemed to her
a needless expense. “But suppose you had
wound up the estate, and then a Mr. Jones,
of Gumeracha, turned up and said your
father owed him a large sum?” She yas un-
expectedly angry. “I’m sure,” she said, “it’s
the other way round, if anything]” And it
appeared that the deceased really had had i
business dealings with a man of that name and;
place. My typical citizen for the future will
sound less lifelike, but safer; something like
Nebuchadnezzar Bulwiggle, of Devilsholme.

“Ex;.-D.”: A whisper goes through the
underworld that the elusive Richard Buckley,
for whom the police have been searching for
six months in connection with the crime that
sent Angus Murray to the gallows, is either
out of Australia or dead. To anybody
familiar with the world of
crookdom it is inconceivable
that a man with several hun-
dred pounds of blood money
on his head should have re-
mained so long in hiding
without somebody having
“shelved” him. The criminal
engaged in evading capture
can do so for only as long
as he has cash with which
to purchase shelter and
silence. “Squizzy” Taylor
was able to remain in
“smoke” for a twelvemonth
because the State did not
consider him worth paying
a reward for, and because he
was liberally supplied with
funds. Had only £5O been
offered for him he would
have been sold to his natu-
ral enemies within a few
days. In the underworld
there is no such tiling as mateship, in spite
of all the flam that’s talked about it.

“Bogata”: Re the soldier’s chances of

determine with any accuracy where missiles

Often a group of men watching an enemy
machine some distance away would feel con-
vinced that they were quite safe —until a
bomb landing in their midst would undeceive
them. Similarly there would frequently be
a scatter for cover when an aeroplane was
apparently right overhead, and in such a
position that it seemed impossible for those
in it to miss. Yet the bomb was quite likely
to fall a quarter of a mile to one side. As
experience was gained it came to be recog-
nised that when an enemy aeroplane was
overhead the safest thing to do was to re-
main perfectly still. Because of speed and
other factors, the course taken by a missile
dropped from a ’plane is never vertical, where-
fore accuracy of aim on the part of the pilot
is quite out of the question.
The speculations of “2nd Divvy” :
It may be taken for granted that the so-called
“death ray” is genuine. It may also be assumed
that no one nation will have a monopoly of it. Gun-
powder, cannon-balls, sling-shot, machine-guns, Q.F.
field guns, howitzers, huge stationary guns, torpe-
does, submarines, battle ’planes and gas were all
PUTTING HIM IN HIS PLACE.
THE MAN: “Excuse me, are you wearing fancy dress?"
SHE: “What do you think? By the way, have you got a musk on,
or is that, just your face?”
introduced as the special property of some enterpris-
ing race, and almost immediately became the
property of every nation interested in homicide.
Similarly there is not the slightest doubt that
counters Will be found; in fact, they probably exist
already. Unfortunately the weapon of the first
instance, is always stronger than the counter. Forts
and battleships go down before big guns, and gas-
masks are but feeble answers to an intensive gas
bombardment. The ray will not stop war, but it
looks as though it might revolutionise fighting to an
even greater extent than the discovery of gun-
powder did. It is apparently only a matter of
generating enough power, and armies, navies and
airships may be destroyed across half a continent. If
that is so the unit of power at sea will become the
smallest possible craft, developing the greatest pos-
sible speed; armies will be replaced by scattered
stations which will need to be skilfully hidden rather
than heavily manned, and the airship will go out
of business as a fighting instrument altogether. In
other words, the “death ray” threatens the greatest
unemployment problem the world has evei known.
Not only are millions of soldiers and sailois likely to
be thrown on the labor market, but they will be
preceded by the other millions who are now em-
ployed in shipyards and munition works. The Hood
alone absorbed 20,000 men for a couple of years, and
the Macdonald Government gave as a reason tor
going on with the six-cruiser programme of their
predecessors the necessity of keeping the Clydeside in
work. The One gleam of hope that the device offers
rich, underpopulated countries such as Australia is
the possibility of cheap defence. But not cheap for
long—the Dreadnought ray generator, costing millions
sterling, will come, if history is any guide. Warfare
is the one thing in which humanity never economises.

“Homfrey Beale” : The other day I visited
by invitation a small N.S.W. North Coast
school. After a few events the mistress,
glancing at my “returned” badge, said, “Now,
I’ll let you hear the class recite something
that I’m sure you, as a soldier, will very
much appreciate.” At her instruction the
class rose and bellowed this;
May the man through whose doings the nations have
Find his crime like a mountain depressing his head;
May the dead make him anguish and sigh ;
And ere Europe commences to prosper again,
May the culprit be praying to Heaven in vam
For a gracious permission to die !
Mav the horrors of death make his life like a Hell
From which pleasures of life will afford him no spell,
And the thoughts of his wealth no relief;
May he close his career in an utter disgrace.
Shunned and jeered at alike by his kith and his race,
With no friends to take part in his grief.
When the kiddies had ended she said : “Recite
it again, children—as if you meant it. Put
more bitterness into it!” and the nippers
fairly hissed it. I borrowed the book later
“The Royal Toast,” by K. J. Back, of
Mullumbimby—and found the verses on page
71 After going through it, it seems to me
that Bruntnell should start an Index Expur-
gatorius for schools.
“Herodot”: There is a well-known doctor
in Sydney with a valuable watch, presented
to him by a grateful patient, which he re-
gards with little of the pride such testi-
monials generally inspire. Shortly after
qualifving, he was a frequent visitor at
Metropolitan racecourses, where he became
acquainted with
some of the
shady characters
invariably to be
found in such
places. Late one
night he was
aroused at his
quarters by a fur-
ti v e individual,
who notified him
that his _ profes-
sional services and
instruments were
required at an
address in the
’Loo, and that a
vehicle was wait-
ing outside. Hav-
ing arrived at his
destination, a house
in one of the back
streets, by various
detours, the doctor
found one of his
racecourse
acquaintances with
a revolver-bullet in
the right shoulder,
the result, it was
explained, of some
skylarking earlier
in the night. A
special request was
made that the
matter should not
be reported to the
police, who would
be sure to come
“pokin’ aroun’ an’
annoyin’ people.”
After extracting
the bullet, and, in-
cidentally, noting
that it was of the
size used in police
revolvers, the
Galen departed,
making a mental
resolve that in
future he would be more particular concern-
ing casual acquaintances. A few days late 1 ’
he received by registered post a gold watcn
and chain, without anything to show whence
it had come. Even the number of the watch
and a former owner’s name inside the case
had been obliterated.

“Jimmy Darwin” : Northern Territory the
other day provided a neat comment on the
terror the prison has for Brother Binghi. A
warder had a gang of blacks out on some
work. On taking them “home” for the
night he overlooked one member. It was
the member himself brought. the reminder.
presently finding himself left in the lurch, he
hurried'along to the gateway and clamored
for admission. “By cripe, him no bin likem
left out,” he said in tones of bitter reproach.
WAS HE HER LITTLE BIRDIE?
“At the war I once had three thousand men
under me.”
“Won-der-ful! Were you an aviator.,-
darling?”
“Rounds” : Witness in a South Melbourne
wife-beating case was asked how he could
reconcile it with his manliness that he stood
by unmoved while the defendant treated his
wife in such a brutal fashion. “I couldn't
interfere,” was the reply; “I was filling my
pipe.”

TINNED ECSTASY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“An attempt is being made to broadcast by wire-
less, the song of the nightingale from the surrey
woods.”
Oh, the Maytime woods of Surrey
Where the laughing elm-trees stand,
With the little leaves that scurry
From the breeze’s sunlit hand,
Where the beech is tall and shining
And the oak has shadows brown
And the chalk-pits show the lining
Of the fringed cloak of the down!
There the birds from dawn till gloaming
Fill the air between the showers
With their song, while swallows homing
Make long flights above the flowers ;
And in crooked scented byways
Waggons plough the ruts again,
Heedless of the thronging highways
And the distant screaming train.
O’er the Maytime woods of Surrey
Dorking looks to tall Box Hill,
And the motor-lorries hurry
Past the taverns gazing still
From their windows opened bravely
To the sunlight and the breeze,
Smelling opulently, gravely,
Of their sawdust, beer and cheese.
But when darkness falls on Surrey—
Hooded darkness soft and deep—-
And the fighting finches flurry
In the branches where they sleep,
From low twigs of bushes olden
In the starlight sweet and pale.
Comes the gush of music golden
Of the mating nightingale.
Hidden somewhere, a receiver
Made of vulcanite and wire
Takes the notes from that bold weaver
Of clear air and mellow fire,
Bids the breath of Maytime bear it
To the cities far and near
That a heedless throng may share it
With a tilted cockney ear.
THE COMFORTER.
FLO : “Everything I do, Miss Jones does the very same.
MARIE: “Never mind., dear —she only makes a fool of
herself.”
Nightingales in Maytime Surrey
Fill the happy night with song;
But the world is in a hurry—
Woodland waiting takes too long.
Oram the days with ceaseless clamor!
Swell the nights with sound and food!
But there stays an ancient glamor
On a starlit Surrey wood.

“Kismet” welcomes a good man home
Dr. H. Leighton Jones, chief medicine-man of the
Northern Territory, and his friend Christy, late
Government Secretary, built them a boat, a bit o
a thing that the sea-lawvers of Darwin shook then-
heads about, 45 feet long, 14 feet beam, with a
12-h.p. engine, schooner rig; and in it these two
adventurers and one sailor-man made the deep
waters of the Dutch East Indies, and later Malay
States. For seven golden months they laved their
red-taped souls in the blue waters whence Solo-
mon drew his pearls, and the medicine-man put in
some fine work at the Congress of the Far Eastern
Tropical Medical Association, which was attended by
representatives from all parts of the world. Inci-
dentally, nothing really new was brought forth on
tropical diseases, their cause and treatment. The
hospitality they met was prodigious. The I ' ea . l
personage they were not' able to visit was the Dutch
Governor-General. He can be seen only by beings
clad in belltopper and spats, or their tropical equi-
valents, and our men hadn’t thought of taking
them. T . „
During the war years Dr. Leighton Jones worked a
lone hand amongst the sick of the Northern Terri-
tory. His practice extended over an area two
and a half times greater than Great Britain: it
stretched from Darwin to Oodnadatta. Extra toil
came in with the Pine Creek to Katherine railway, a
stretch of 60 miles, with 600 men on the construc-
tion. Fortunately typhoid kept out, and old con-
struction hands are satisfied that this unique experi-
ence was entirely due to the precautions formulated
and rigorously enforced by the doctor. A regular
devil he for gauze-hats on tanks, and all that sort
of thing. Darwin dug out its every flag the day he
returned. And well it might. In the eight years
of his service there have been no epidemics; all the
Territory has had has been a little whooping-cough
and measles, brought in by tourists. Malaria is,
however, admitted to —it used to be against the
policy of the Administration to even shiver with it.
A batch of 50 returned men from the Jordan Valley
area probably resuscitated it ; certainly only sporadic
cases had been treated for the few years previous
to their advent.

“Pedro”: Says The Bulletin (22/5/’24) :
The assumption of the title of private detective—
though anv criminal is at liberty to so describe him-
<^e]f —confers an unwritten license.... The danger
Of this state of affairs to the peace and good govern-
ment needs no stressing.
All gospel; but how true it is that the little
things are what we squeal loudest about!
In N. S. Wales any butcher may treat and
maltreat any person for any disease or ail-
ment provided he doesn’t call himself doc-
tor.” Any dark-skinned ex-pedlar or white-
skinned ex-scavenger may pretend to diag-
nose and treat with chopped buffalo-grass or
other herbage anyone who has an ill or thinks
be has, by setting up a “herbalist” shingle.
Any tinker may examine your eyes and pre-
scribe spectacles and even make, or fake, the
same. Any rogue may call himself a real
estate agent and get a living by proving with
house and land property that fools and their
money are soon parted. And any adventurer
with his tongue on a swivel may call himseit
a politician and claim —and very often get
the right to make the people’s laws and assess
tlieir taxes. The law thus allows men ot gall
and guile to kill you or your child, to rob
you of your money or your eyesight, and to
tax you to the skin. To complain about
mere blackmailing, therefore, is like punish-
ing a person for pinching the gold from the
teeth of the corpse of the person whom the
robber has killed by murder.

“Wart” : Mention of the Norfolk, the 25-
ton schooner in which Bass and I linders
circumnavigated Tas. in 1798 (B. 8/5/ 24),
reminds one that
she was built by
the Norfolk Island-
ers, because no ship
had arrived from
Sydney for so long
that they began to
think they were
forgotten by the
outer world. Sup-
plies were about ex-
hausted, so the tiny
community set to
work to build a
schooner which
they expected
would be kept in
the Norfolk Island
trade. Norfolk
Island pine was
the timber used,
and an “ingenious
man” on the island
made a sextant for
navigation pur-
poses. But the
builders didn’t reap
the reward their
enterprise and in-
dustry deserved;
for " Gov. King
commandeered the
boat on her arri-
val in Sydney, and
I doubt whether
she was ever seen
at Norfolk Island again.
* * * *
“Morehead” : The place where May Ander-
son, one of Sydney’s unfortunates, was hid-
eously and mysteriously murdered is only 250
yards from the western wall of Bong Bay
Gaol. This desolate piece of country, criss-
crossed with winding sand tracks, where the
gnarled and stunted scrub bears witness to
long years of battling with racing souther-
lies and whistling westerlies, is marked, on the
maps as a recreation reserve. But. it is never
used for recreation ; the thick prickly scrub
is no good even to loving couples. The
wild flowers that once grew in profusion
have long since been rooted up, and in winter
it is one of the most bleak and mournful
places in outer Sydney. A straggling red
road winds through the scrubland to the
flats below, where fresh green squares of
Chinamen’s gardens jostle dejected poultry-
farms. Beyond the farms a cluster of chim-
neys proclaim the presence of tanneries and
a paper-mill; further to the west, through a
clump of tall pine-trees, the silver waters
of Botany gleam. It is a grim, forsaken
nlace that hasn’t altered since the days
when as a boy I rambled thereabouts,
and read with quaking heart a “Deadwood
Dick” in a deserted cemetery that nestles in
a hollow not half a mile from the scene
of the murder.
“Hennessy”: “Skipper” (B. 24/4/’24)
states that he was a member of a district
court-martial which convicted a sergeant
of “desertion” because he left the base for
the front. He adds that the tribunal had
“no choice” because the facts were admitted.
But the Manual of Military Law is most
emphatic that intention is the basis of de-
sertion. If there is no intention to leave
the service or to avoid some duty for which
he is detailed —the Manual gives as an illus-
CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE.
“I have a new baby brother.”
“Is he going to stay?"
“I think so. He has all his things off."
tratiou a skulker who cannot be found until
after his regiment has embarked for active
service—there is no desertion. The alter-
native charge of “absence without leave” is
usually framed to catch the cunning offender
who has well concealed his intention. If
“Skipper's” Court had both charges before it,
it could easily have let the sergeant down
under the a.w.l. If it had the desertion
charge alone it would be a complete answer
that the accused was still serving. Even if
the Court found him guilty of desertion be-
cause he served under another name, the
finding was wrong, and I suggest that the
Court’s “unhappiness” was caused by the
wigging it got when it sent the proceedings
on for confirmation.
* * * *
“XN.O.”: “Edward Denman” says (B.
ir>/5/’24) that beside the Buff's the “only
other corps of any sort” privileged to march
through London with fixed bayonets, drums
beating, etc., are the H.A.G., the Royal
Marines, and the 3rd Battalion of the Grena-
dier Guards. May I add that the Royal
Navy also enjoys the honor, and also that it
takes precedence of the military when both
services are present? London in this con-
nexion means merely the small area centred
in the Roval Exchange that constitutes
the “City.” The rule was relaxed on a notable
occasion during the Peace celebrations, when
all units marched through the City with
bayonets fixed.
And “C. Tic Toe” : The Buffs may claim
the sole prerogative among infantry regiments
of marching through London “with fixed
bayonets, drums beating and colors flying”
(B. 15,/r>/’24> , but on Anzac Day, 1918,
numerous “infantry regiments” of the A.I.F.
marched past Edward P. and Douglas Haig
at Australia House with fixed bayonets and
drums beating, though colors were not flying
except from unauthorised Aussie ’planed
cavorting overhead. Some staff johnnie who
ventured to protest about the ancient Buff
privilege was given to understand that some-
thing stronger than war beer would be
needed to induce the Diggers to “unfix.”
* * * *
“Brud” : Talking about military executions
and the relative merits of firing-parties ana
machine-guns (B. 8 and 15/5/’24). While
Captain .Tames Blakey, of 11.M.T. Caledonia,
was engaging in bringing away the survivors
of the Cape Ilelles evacuation, he tried to
ram a Hun submarine. The U-boat broke
water, and torpedoed the Caledonia amid-
ships; and a British general and his staff,
with Captain Blakey, were taken aboard the
sub. and handed over to the military authori-
ties in Fiume. Within 48 hours of arrival
there. Blakey had been tried by c.-m. and
sentenced to be shot the following morning.
Courteously he was asked if he preferred a
machine-gun or a firing-party. In his gentle
way he explained to the interpreter that it
mattered little —his Oft. llin. and 16st. would
be an easy mark for either. However, the
British Government promptly threatened re-
prisals if Blakey were treated as Fryer had
been, and his captors thought better of it.
Perhaps they remembered that Tirpitz’s son
was a prisoner in England, and had been put
No. 1 on a certain list that had been passed
to the Germans.

“E.D.”: It was in a church at Albert
Park (Melb.). The clergyman was deep in
his sermon, but a
man at the back of
the congregation
was attracting
more attention
than the preacher
by his eccentric be-
havior. Whenever
the minister
paused, either for
effect or to collect
his thoughts, the,
other would cheer-
fully ejaculate:
“H ear, hear!
Hear, hear!”
Once or twice'
elders and officials
moved in his direc-
tion, and expostu-
lated with the
stranger, but the
objections merely
stimulated him to
fresh expressions of
approval. “Very
good!” commented
the bad man. “Hear,
hear! Hear, hear!”
There was a dis-
inclination to
throw the interjec-
tor out. the spec-
tacle of an appa-
rently peaceable
man being fired
from the sacred
edifice being con-
sidered incom-
patible with the
spirit of Chr i s-
tianity; but pre-
sently when the
clergyman ceased
and the disturber of the peace arose on two
unsteady legs, and said in a high-pitched
voice. “Will the can’date kin’ly tell usfi
watsh hish ’pinion of the redistribution ot
sheats bill?” it was decided to stretch a
point. 9
“Rita”: The clerks at the Adelaide
Telegraph Office receiving counter were busy
attending to the usual before-lunch rush,
when an over-dressed matron pushed her
way through the crowd and thrust a telegram
form before one of the clerks with a super;
cilious “Attend to this at once, please. Ai
am in a hurry.” Without looking up the
clerk told her'that she would have to wait
her turn. Finally her turn came, and, as the
clerk banded her back the form with the
necessary stamps, she exclaimed; “What!
Am Ai to stick these on maiself? Wo,
madam,” barked the clerk —“on the tele-
gram.”
ANOTHER HOPELESS DAWN.
“Oh, well, the first year of marriage is natu-
rally one of adjustment."
“And after?"
“Of readjustment, I suppose.’'

Captain Andrew Lang, killed in a motor
rsmash near Camperdown (Vie.) last week,
took more liberties with his life than any
average dozen decorated soldiers, and yet he
was undecorated; He offered himself to the
A.I.F. as soon as the war began, but was
rejected by the doctors. The R.F.C. accepted
him, and he got to France, but was invalided
to Australia in 1915. Then he raised the
4th Australian Flying Corps, and took it to
England, but could not do better for himself
than the command of a home-service training
squadron. Yet this man, who was not con-
sidered physically fit for France—the one
serious tragedy of his cheerful life —was con-
sistently employed at one of the most danger-
ous and delicate jobs in the British air ser-
vice—that of testing ’planes. He piloted
Hurley in F'apua, flew Lebbeus Hordern’s
L CAPTAIN WILKINS, explorer, aviator and
photographer, of Adelaide, who haft met
his old colleague Stefansson this week
to discuss a scheme for further exploring
the heart of Australia.
Fleetwings in Sydney, and was notable in
the motoring world, while as “Napier Lion,”
of the Sydney Mail, he demonstrated an
hereditary gift for writing. He belonged to
one of the most versatile families in the Em-
pire. He was named after his famous uncle,
and at the present time Langs are prominent
in the Indian Civil Service, in all the profes-
sions (either here or in the United Kingdom)
and in practically every department of sport.
Stefansson, the explorer, who opens a lec-
turing tour in Sydney this week, proposes
later to visit our so-called Sahara. He
should be the very man for the job. For
generations learned theorists, living in Lon-
don, Berlin, etc., had proclaimed that the
Arctic regions were not only economically
worthless, but for the most part (in the
words of the “Encyclopaedia Britannica”)
"without animal life,” and hence uninhabit-
able by Europeans. Stefansson’s effective
criticism was to put in five years in the
Arctic, and to return convinced that the in-
troduction there of the domestic reindeer and
musk-ox will yet help to solve the world's
meat problem. The interior of the Com-
monwealth has always been accepted as un-
inhabitable by certain pedants of the cities,
just as. a century ago the rich lands on the
other side of N.S.W.’s Blue Mountains were
anathema to most of the then inhabitants of
Sydney. Stefansson may help to do for our
so-called waste regions what Wentworth and
his companions did for the West: he has the
ability not only to get where he wants, but
to draw the right deductions from what he
sees.
When there was more imagination, good and
bad, in Australian politics, Charles Ander-
son, who died in Sydney last week, provided
the Commonwealth with “the six hatters”—
one of the most popular myths of the period.
It was in the days of the “New Protection,*’
when a sharp eye was given to immigration,
lest there should be “dumping” of tradesmen
under foreign-made agreements; and Ander-
son, then busy establishing the felt-liat in-
dustry in N. S. Wales, imported 48 opera-
tives. Three-fourths of them were admitted ;
and then half a dozen were held up for in-
quiries. Whereupon the old Freetrade crowd
represented British citizens as being pushed
off from Australian soil at the end of pitch-
forks and bayonets. Long after the men
were quietly at work in the factory at Surry
Hills, the bloodcurdling story continued to
be told. Mr. Anderson’s enterprise was a
great success; and the old gentleman—he
was 86 at his death—has been able for many
years past to sit back and see it flourish
under the control of his sons.
When A. J. Hampson died from heart
failure at Nandaly, Sea Lake (Vic.), the
other day, an old-style Labor stalwart went
out. Hampson objected to certain of his kin
not volunteering during the war, and to
show in a practical way his feeling in the
matter enlisted himself. Hughes contested
and won his seat (Bendigo) while he
was absent on service. Before getting into
the Reps, lie used to be Labor member for
Bendigo East in the Assembly; and but for
the bitterness of the no-conscription fanatics
he would have ousted Lister from the Corio
seat and got back into the Federal House at
the last elections. Lately he has been doing
good work as inspector of soldier settlements
in Victoria.
When Bishop Barry, of Goulburn, is
consecrated next month, the preacher of the
day should be Monsignor Hayden, President
of the Cardinal’s College at Manly. He is
the greatest runner-up in Australasia. For
almost every vacancy within the last 20 years
he has been a starter (and mostly a place-
getter), and now that the dour old handi-
capper, Rev. Father Time, has made his
w-eight prohibitive, his remarks as the most
also-ran candidate in the Bishopric Plate
should be illuminative. His younger half-
brother was a winner first-up for Forbes-
Wilcannia.
Sir William Goschen, just dead, belonged
to a family that has been English for only a
century : yet in that time it has given two
unforgettable phrases to the history of the
nation. George (the first Viscount) became
Salisbury s Chancellor of the Exchequer in
188 1 (the occasion when Lord Randolph
Churchill “forgot Goschen”), and the late
diplomatist brought Bethmann-Hollweg’s
damning remark about “a scrap of paper”
back from Berlin at the beginning of the
war. The Goschens w r ere originally Germans,
the foundation of the family fortune having
been the firm of Friihling and Goschen.
"The Deacon”: Charles Anderson, a Scot
out of Banffshire, who laid the foundation of
the hat industry in N. S. Wales 40 years
ago, combined in his earlier days the making
• fine .plumage for brass-hats and ecclesias-
tics. One of his most prolific sources of
cash was the R.C. clergy, lay and clerical,
over half Australia. Till he went out of
the retail business 17 years ago he hatted
and clothed most of them. Even from Maori-
l.and orders used to pour in, and his exit
from the business was grievously deplored.
None of his successors made any great fist
of the more intricate clerical toggery till
Coogan and Britton took over. But Coogan
soon went into insurance work, and Britton,
who has only one leg, left to argue with
Strawberry on a South Coast farm.
Former Victorian Agent-General John
Taverner, who died last December, left
£2764 to his widow. When he made his will
in 3921 Taverner directed that in the event
of the lady’s death the property should go
to their adopted son. It was news to many
of his friends that the gap in a childless
home had been filled by an adopted child.
Incidentally, it was only after the death of
Duncan Gillies, another Agent-General, that
the great majority of his friends learned that
he had married while representing Vic. in
London. Perhaps we mind other people’s
business less than we sometimes think we do.
Premier Peacock, of Vic., when his con-
stituents were giving him a sliivoo at Cres-
wick in honor of his third term as head of a
Government, claimed that his 35 years’ ser-
vice for practically the same constituency is
“unique.” Of course it isn’t. E. H.
Cameron had 40 years’ continuous service for
“practically the same constituency” (Eve-
lyn). But Peacock holds the record among
living politicians. Sternberg, M.L C., the
runner-up, came in two years after he did.
“Galleryite”: Of Peacock’s four metropoli-
tan Ministers, Robinson, Cohen and Eggles-
ton are not overwhelmingly popular with
fellow-members. The more prosperous Robin-
son grows the less inclined he is to suffer
fools gladly ; Eggleston is dour, podgy and
Curzon-like; and Cohen, who was expected
to be a second Isaac Issacs, has proved a
disappointment. The fourth, Dr. Argyle,
is only a sub-leader yet, and has not acquired
the knack of managing men ; but he is earn-
ing respect. An idol he will never be. but he
has qualities which will, if developed, make
lum a leader, despite that Toorakian environ-
ment which is not good for any aspiring
Minister.
Beardmore, an Hon. Minister in Peacock’s
Government, has a family of 14—eight sons
and six daughters. Ex-Premier Lawson’s
brood of eight is hardly worth mentioning in
face of that. A native of the State, Beard-
more hails from the Upper Murray.
Lewis Propsting, stock and share broker,
who was associated with Zeehan mining
affairs for over a quarter of a century, has
died in Hobart. He had clients all over
the Commonwealth, and his office in Collins-
street was bulging with forfeited and defunct
company scrip, reminiscent of the wild and
woolly days of the West Coast. Being a
man of method he carefully docketed and pre-
served forfeited scrip, mining wires, letters,
call receipts, etc., dating back to the early
eighties, thus piling up a collection of stuff
a-om which a reliable history of the Zeehan
held could be written.

asserted that the last of the Crimean
veterans in Australia had died: and

“Skipper”: Enter Thomas 11. Heritage, of
Adelaide, for the Abraham Stakes. He has
10 children, 41 grandchildren, 58 great-grand-
children and one great-great-grandchild, or
a great grand total of 110; and he has been
a resident for only 68 years.
Passed out in Townsville, at S 3, George
McLennan, a Scot who had been in Banana-
land since 1865. In his younger days he
held the tossing-the-caber championship, and
won the first medal presented in Queensland
for rifle-shooting. An old associate of
Robert Philp, he was with Burns, Philp and
Co. for many years.
“Pantagruel” : Ted Eite, possibly the oldest
pioneer of C. and W. Bananaland, went over
the range in Dunwich the other day at 95. A
native of Nottingham, he settled at Clermont
in the ’sixties, was first a butcher, then a
miner and next a selector, keeping hard at
it till failing strength and eyesight called a
halt. _ Latterly the veteran was totally blind.
His wife, aged 85, survives, with 24 grand-
children and 12 great-grandchildren.
Another man who- was in at the death in
the Kelly gang hunt has just passed over,
at 70, in Melbourne—ex-Trooper J. M.
Arthur. In his active days he was a fine
athlete, and his bushcraft equipped him
for the special job of bringing publicity to
gentlemen whose modesty drove them to
plant their distilling businesses in sylvan
solitudes.
Died at 59, James Malcolm Mason, one of
Maoriland’s most brilliant medicoes and
its authority on bacteriology. Mason
collected medical degrees from Brussels,
Paris, Edinburgh, Glasgow and Cambridge;
and while practising in England he took his
legal examinations and was called to the
Bar. He was an examiner for the M.L.
’Varsity for five years, vice-president of the

Governor Liver-
pool’s pet hospital
ship Marama. Yet
he found time to

and several pamph-
lets on tubercu-
losis.
Methodist parson John A. Waddell, who
became an octogenarian this month, inherits
his distrust of Rome from an ancestry which
goes back, on his mother’s side, to the Rev.
George Walker, who figured in the defence of
Londonderry. Tom Waddell, once a Pre-
mier of N. S. Wales and now an M.L.C., is
a brother. The veteran cleric climbed into
the pulpit 57 years ago, and can still take
two services a day when required.
Mackey, ex-Speaker of the Vic. Assembly,
who was so keen on enactments relating to
wills, left no will himself, and the widow has
had to apply for letters of administration.
Perhaps he shrank from making a testament
in view of the smallness of his estate.
Should Prime Minister Ramsay Macdonald
wed a daughter of the Earl of De la Warr,
as suggested by gossiping cables, he will be
a brother-in-law, in the second degree, of Sir
Gerald Strickland, one-time Governor of
N.S.W., and ex-Governor Lamington of
Queensland.
Snowball, Grandmaster of Victoria’s Yel-
low Pup, told the Assembly the other day that
he had been threatened by three Ministers
with opposition in his electorate if he didn't
vote for the Redistribution of Seats Bill, and
that he had replied that he would rather go
out of the House than act under duress.
Since Bent died, in 1909, Snowball has been
Brighton’s choice, but in Parliament he lias
never got further than the chairmanship of
a committee. Pie is an uncertain party
man—he holds a safe seat and can afford to
follow* his natural inclination to be honest.
Fifteen years ago The Bulletin discov-
ered T. PI. Lennard, a little old Cambridge-
shire man who had known most of the
prominent political and social identities of
N. S. Wales in the half-century. Until
recently, when he retired, he was a Sydney
bootmaker. In his cottage at Waverley
were thousands of books and pictures dealing
with the early days of Australia, and par-
ticularly with the activities of Henry
Parkes: they filled the parlor from floor to
roof, and overflowed into all the other;
rooms, which likewise contained masses of
china, Sheffield plate, lustre and silver.
When Mrs. Lennard died he decided to
move, but scorned to hold a sale, and most
of his possessions were given to public insti-
tions. Now he lives in Mascot, and is col-
lecting again as hard as ever—a remarkable
example of an art engaged in for its ow 7 n
sake.
“T.P.”: Ballarat College celebration gives
thought of its old rival, Grenville College,
with Arthur Buley as head. Back in the
’seventies, as an M.A. honorman, he was
assistant to Principal Victor, and later took
the school over with a Specially big following
of devout Wesleyans, for he was a leading
light in their Lydiard-street church. Among
others, Bernard O’Dowd, Judge Wasley and
Alfred Fussell owed their chances largely to
him. When the State Continuation Schools
with their absence of fees sounded the “Last
Post” for Grenville, Director Tate, care-
fully watching the interests of the secondary
men out of jobs, gave Buley a good billet in
the Melbourne Continuation School, corres-
pondence-tuition branch. This he held till
the (stupid in his case) 65 age-limit retired
him. A couple of years ago I met him
sprinting up a mountain side in the Austra-
lian Alps, as cheerful and active as in the
years long gone.

“Homfrey Beale”: Papuan coast women
are much better treated by their husbands than their
inland sisters. Among most inland tribes it is a
quite common occurrence for a husband to club or
spear his wife to death for a very trivial offence,
such as under-cooking or over-cooking a meal or
accidentally upsetting a water or other vessel. The
peculiar thing is the women seem to admire this
trait, and no sooner has an infuriated husband de-
spatched his wife than other dusky belles are giving
him the glad eye, loudly expressing their utter
abhorrence of the dead wife’s particular failing and
their own freedom from it, as well as their many
other real or imaginary virtues. Amongst the
coastal tribes the men are a henpecked lot, and it is
only when roused to a state of ultra-exasperation
that they will turn. Even then their worst form
of reprisal is generally a scolding and threats of
corporal punishment. If a coast man does beat his
wife she immediately leaves him and goes to parents
or friends. The husband is then annoyed by all the
women of the village till he is glad to creep to
the friends or relatives as a suppliant, confessing him-
seli in fault and begging for his wife, and taking
with him costly presents as a bribe for their
influence on his behalf. It's an expensive hobby.

“Corso” : The new hand informed me he
was a Norwegian and that he had arrived in Aus-
tralia only two months previously. “Can you ride
a horse?” I asked. “No,” he confessed. “Can you
plough?” “No.” “Can you dig spuds?” “No.”
“What the blazes can you do?” I gasped. “I
can milk reindeers,” was the imperturbable reply.
He escaped when I streaked for the gun.
* *•...* *
“ Jackeroo”: There must be something
about droving which appeals to Eve. Recently a
mob of fat cattle was railed from Townsville to
Brisbane as an experiment. (It turned out a suc-
cess, by the way.) They were brought in from the
Gulf country by four drovers —two of them the Misses
Anderson. Another mob is on the track from Barkly
Tablelands to Adelaide—7oo miles. Included in the
outfit is a flapper of 14 years from Helen Springs
station, said to be the best hand of the lot.
“Imbaga”: “Te Pana” on turtle-catching
by hand (B. 8/5/’24) recalls an incident in Papua
during the closing days of Le Hunte’s consulate.
The launch Ruby was towing a whaleboat full of
native police near Daru, when an immense leather-
back turtle rose between the launch and the tow.
He was only up an instant, but that was time
enough for Sergeant Anthony to hop on to his back,
in full kit as he was—bandolier, bayonet and all.
The boat went over them both, but as the launch
cast off and turned Anthony and his mount appeared
in the wake. The rest of the crew went over like
fleas from a scalded dog, and after a great eatch-as-
cateh-can-CMTO-buckjumping exhibition made the big
chap fast. There was a stiff chop on the water,
with a south-east breeze rising, and Le Hunte
counted it the best show he had seen in 30 years
of Colonial Office officialdom. The prize was close on
Bft. from end to end, and the jagged longitudinal
ridges on the back gave his bare-legged riders
something to think about.
* * * *
“Wessel” : The first picture and description
of the laughing-jackass ever published
were produced in 1770 by M. Son-
nerat, a French naturalist who
visited New Guinea and the Moluccas
in 1772. That the bird figured and
described is the kookaburra and not
the Dacelo leachi of New Guinea is
made certain by the fact that it
has a dark mark on the cheeks which
is not found on the New Guinea
species. As Sonnerat does not appear
to have visited Australia at all, and
as the kookaburra is not found else-
where, the question is how did he get
hold of it? Through Malay tre-
pangers, perhaps.
* * ♦
“J.G.” : Throughout the Wal-
lan (Vic.) district where pinus insig-
nis grows very rapidly autumn and
early winter produce a prolific crop
of bilious-looking fungus, like mon-
ster mushrooms. This particular
breed of fungus is evidently allied to
the pines, as it grows nowhere else
but adjacent to the trees, or as far
as the roots spread under the soil.
Many specimens are upwards of 9in.
in diameter and all are very thick
and fleshy, brown on top and yellow
underneath. Can any Abo. give it
a name and say whether it is edible,
or if it is harmful to other vege-
tation ?
* * *
“Gouger”: Remarkable how
widespread is the belief that rheu-
matism certainly grips the wearer of
a snakeskin belt? Many bushmen can
tan a snakeskin into a unique-looking
belt, but few will wear it on account
of its sinister reputation, and most of
those few will wear only the skin of
the carpet-snake. In an Ishmael life I have met. but
one man who wore a black snakeskin belt—and he
did it purely out of cussedness to prove his mate a
rheumatic liar. Some men (and many women) are
like that.
“Bouragi”: “E.S.S.” may sleep sound in
his bed for many years if the extinction of the
dugong in our northern waters is his only night-
mare (B. 8/5/’24). They exist in vast numbers
from Brisbane northward, and occasional outbreaks
of “the great dugong industry” have no effect on
the herds. Up those coasts, especially in the Straits
and on the Papuan side, sea-cow is hunted by the
natives. Half a dozen would be a boshter catch
for one run, though in the season one can see them
by the hundred in a day. They travel a great deal,
too, and soon, leave a dangerous locality. Up the
n.-e. coast of Papua, where no one hunts them,
they throng thickly. Though he is often seen on
the surface, the dugong is much harder to get at
than the whale or seal, and the only ways of catch-
ing him are the native method of spearing in
shallow water and the white man’s idea of netting
in narrow passes—this used to be practised in the
THE TIME-SAVER.
“Eh, Joe, if you’re going down to the pub, you might get Jack
drunk as quick as possible. I want ’im ’ome early to-night.”
South Passage in Moreton Bay. As to the dugong's
abandonment of Botany Bay and other shallow south-
ern waters, one can safely blame traffic for that.
He is a shy bird and a lover of lonely places.
“U.P.” : Dad had been away for a fort-
night, and his cobber came round to see hitn. “Well,
how did y’ like it down in town—awl right?” “Aw,”
said Dad, “I wus bound for Adelid, as y’ know, but
when I got to the Five-mile pub I met ol’ Bill
Arkin. We ’ad a few drinks, and ’e tol’ me about
that ol’ bull uv ’is, and a couple of other yarns
about ’is old woman; and then I arsks the date, and
blow me if me two weeks ’adn’t gone and it was
time to get back to w’ork! Wunnerful ’ow the time
flies when yer away from ’ome.”
* * * *
“Jimmy Possum”: “Akran’s” bull who
relieved the mare of her milk (B. 17/4/’24) recalls
a boar I know who regularly milked a cow. Bailup
couldn’t make out what old Blossom, who had no
calf, was doing with her milk, as she never had any
on offer in the morning. She was treated for self-
sucking ; but still the fluid disappeared. Then,
getting up one morning earlier than usual, Blos-
som’s boss saw his prize Berkshire boar, a beast
weighing close on 4001 b., sitting on his haunches
beside her and stripping away contentedly. He
was penned up after that, and old Blossom nearly
died of a broken heart, bellowing to him whenever
she heard him grunt.
“FY7”: “Saaedi’s” discovery that the
artesian flow is decreasing (B. 8/5/’24) is not, as
he thinks, an indication that the supply of under-
ground water will peter out. The decrease is due
to the striking scientific fact that every mouthful
drunk from a pint of beer lowers the beer-level
till the supply is renewed. The great artesian
basins of Australia absorb and hold what was
originally rain water. The upper edges of these
basins, approaching the surface or outcropping—as
at Blythesdale station, near Roma (Q.) —catch the
water, which soaks to the lowest level and returns
to, the surface through the bores because of the
pressure from the water always soaking down the
sloping sides of the basin. The amount of liquid
absorbed varies with the annual rainfall. Naturally
the more bores the less the supply and the pres-
sure. But there are other sources of waste, as in
the Murray River basin, where at some places faults
in the covering rocks permit the escape of artesian
water into the river. Still, as long as water falls
from the clouds it will go on being pushed up
through the bores, however the floxv from individual
pipes may vary.
* * * *
“Homfrey Beale”: Talking of forced
marches w-ith sheep. Three years ago my brother and
V. P. Evans, of Trilby Park, near Walgett
(N.S.W.), took a mob of 800 mixed sheep from
Trilby Park to Carthona station, a distance of 49
miles, in just under two days. They lost none.
The month was February, and the reason for push-
ing them was that there was not a blade of feed
or a. thimbleful of water on the track. Their dog had
half a pint of water, and the two drovers divided a
quart between them for the trip—the remaining
three quarts they started with in the gallon water-
bag evaporated in the intense heat. Any drover
(and most Diggers) will tell you that the endur-
ance required on the second day is several times
greater than that necessary on the first,
* * * *
• “Country Ped” : During the past fallowing
season I have noticed
that in practically
every paddock there is
a big scour, some new,
some bad and many
worse. A lot of time
is wasted ploughing
round and to these
gutters, and when a
scour runs across the
corner of a paddock a
piece of land is left
lying wasted. Now in
the timber paddocks
—the same class of
soil —not a scour is
to be seen. That
should teach the far-
mers a lesson. Why
don’t they plant up
these wasted areas
with trees, and so
make splendid use ot
them ? And wh y
doesn’t the Govern-
ment pass a law for-
bidding the cutting of
road trees ? Every
tree-lined country road
is free from scours;
every road denuded of
trees is disgraced with
channels and wash-
aways, which are a
source of endless ex-
pense. At present, in
Vic., at least, any
farmer can get per-
mission from the Shire
Council to ring trees
close to his boundary-
fence, because the green
trees destroy a little
crop. Does the tree-
destroying farmer ever
think that his Shire
rates would be a lot
less if he refrained
from such destruction ?
* * * *
The danger of chopping wood: —
“K. 1.”: Re “Sylvester’s” contradiction of “Sarah’s”
statement that spotted gum will cause inflammation of
the eyes (B. l/5/’24). Timber men around here
(Q.) -all back up the lady. They blame the sore
eyes to two things—first, the glare of the white
sapwood, and, second, a gas which rises from the
sapwood when it is chopped. A handful of chips
from the green log will burn quite readily, a fact
which makes one chopper declare that an oil fuel
could be extracted from spotted gum.
“Sarah”: Since writing my par. about spotted gum
causing my dad irritation and inflammation of the
eyes, I have discovered three brothers whom it
affects. When I saw two of them, their faces
looked awful—red and swollen —anl according to
them the third brother looked worse still. They
said it also “got” them under the arms, behind
the knees, and especially in the groin; and they
described the itch as quite unbearable at night,
especially if the weather was inclined to be hot.
“Capta”: I don’t know anything about “Sarah’s”
spotted-gum trouble, but I can tell of two good mill-
AND HE THOUGHT HE WAS BAD
ENOUGH.
SENTIMENTAL MAID: “You know, my heart
is in the sea."
THE OTHER : “ ’Strath, you’ve gone one
better than me.”
men of Tas., Bob Usher and Walter Merry, who had
to give up handling blackwood because of a terrible
rash. The symptoms were bung-eyes, a lupus-like
disease on the face and an irritating rash on the
bodv. After spending much money on quacks, they
find the onlv way to deal with the matter is to
give all blackwood a miss. Some industries seem
to have “diseases” all to themselves —as for instance,
the “yolk-boils” that affect shearers in the Tas-
manian midlands.

For there’s a boat at Petrie's Bight
Keeps talking of the sea ;
Through all the starry Brisbane night
She nags and nags at me,
With her siren’s mocking echo
Drifting upwards from the Quay.
1 don’t know where she came from,
I don’t know what she loads;
She may be bound for the China Coast,
Or maybe Hampton Roads.
But when she talks the way she talks
And nags about the sea,
Why, any old scamp of a liner or tramp
Is a beautiful boat to me!
Mackarra, Montoro, Sumatra Maru—
Lord, how it gets you, the ring of their names!
Canadian Cruiser, East Wind, Lammeroo —
Lord, how I love ’em, those sea-going dames!
Whether they travel by sail or by steam,
Whether they’re gamins or queens of the sea,
Whether they’re dirty or clean as a dream
Any old boat is a beauty to me:
Oh, Spring’s come back to Brisbane,
And I would like to stay!
But the old sea’s a-callin’
And I’ll have to go away.
For there’s a boat at New Farm wharf
That came this afternoon;
i heard her whistling to herself
A crazy sort of tune
Of the big white lights of Broadway
And the rice-mills of Rangoon.
Her skipper’s mean as poison,
Her mate’s a Russian Finn,
Her cook’s a half-caste Chinaman—
His mate’s a mortal sin ;
But when she talks the way she talks,
And frets about the sea,
Why, any old boat that’ll sign me on
Is a beautiful boat to me!
FOLLOWING AN ILLUSTRIOUS EXAMPLE.
VISITOR: “Your son seems to be a very daring rider.”
KING BILLY: “My word! Mine tinkit that pfella
forget ’e’s the plurry prince.”
Elmaren, Kanowna, lvuranda, Cape May—
Lord, how they roll and dissolve on my tongue!
Ngatoro, Northumberland, Esperance Bay-
Old and decrepit or eager and young,
When they sing to the sunshine or scowl at the
squalls,
With loud screws revolving and rods racing free—
Oh, it’s Springtime in Brisbane —and Lord, how
she calls!—
But surer and stronger’s the pull of the sea!
QUEENSLAND.

THE SUPREME JUDGE OF MERIT
“Beshill”: When the parson struck the
station, Jacky-Jacky was induced to attend a Sun-
day service at the homestead, and his conduct was
exemplary till half-way through the sermon. The
padre was impressing on his hearers the great powers
of the Almighty—that He could do all things and
that everything He did was right. Jaeky tried hard
to restrain himself, but at last out it came: “If
He bin do all things right, what for Him bin makit
rum longa barrel and water longa creek?”
* * * *
“Larry Longun”: Tell “AdeL” (B.
17/4/’2 4)' that most birds which have a batch of
eggs to the clutch lay more than once in a season
when conditions are generous. The emu is probably
no exception, as I have seen young broods and
bumped against nests of eggs at various times
between spring and the end of autumn. Some birds
will also set up housekeeping afresh if the first
A FELLOW FEELING.
DAD ( sympathetically) : “In the wars again, son?”
WILLIE: Oh, it s all right, dad. Pm better off than you,
anyway. Eve only got her in the daytime— you have
her all night as well.”
batch of eggs is stolen or destroyed. The coucal,
or swamp-pheasant, which usually lays three eggs
to the clutch, will hatch out and rear as many as
three families in the season, and some of the finches
seem to be family-raising the whole year round.
“Gill Guy”: In applying arsenic in treat-
ment of warts, growths, so-called cancer, etc., it
should not be dusted on. Such a method would give
no control, and healthy tissue would be detrimentally
affected around the diseased spot. The best way is
to moisten a little arsenic and apply by rubbing in
with a flat piece of wood exactly on the affected area.
I istulous withers can be cured in this way. Start
with the moistened arsenic right on top of the
swelling, covering a patch (clipped of hair) not
greater than a shilling. Repeat in a few days and
keep on at it. The skin round the patch will crack
and the centre gradually rise until it finally falls
‘"■erboaid like a huge blackhead squeezed out —
taking with it all - the pus-forming mess. The hole
left looks ugly, but it soon heals over, and you
have a slightly scarred but workable horse again.
“Trevdee”: A few weeks ago a monster
wether, which fetched £4 7s. in Newmarket Yards,
Melbourne, tipped the butcher’s scales to 1901 b. dead-
weight. I nominate this chap as the heaviest sheep
ever killed for mutton in Australasia.
“Lily-Beale”: “Liss” (B. 8/5/’24) won-
ders why staggers in sheep occur most frequently
on black-soil country. The reason is that the grass
and herbage of such country is particularly succu-
lent, and consequently causes fermentation more
quickly than the less juicy plants elsewhere. Where
staggers occur from this or most other causes, bleed-
ing, if done at once by splitting the nostrils, will
save a big majority of the mob. I was once travel-
ling with Bob Kelly, son o£ H. C. Kelly, owner of a
station near Walgett (N.S.W.), with 3000 breeding
ewes, and we had the misfortune to strike a patch
of black soil, near Baradine, covered with young,
juicy couch grass—a certain staggers-indueer. Bleed-
ing them by the above-mentioned method, we saved
over 300 out of 400 that were affected.
* * * *
“Bush Cat”: Recent pars about decoying
and poisoning the wily fox move me to remark that
Reynard is not half so wily or cunning as many
other animals—the dingo, for one. The usual manner
of poisoning him out here (West Darling, (N.S.W.)
is to drag a trail with a burnt sheepskin, and drop
baits of fat about the size of a marble. Two men
working together took over 800 skins in this manner
in one season on one station. There is a belief among
foxers that Reynard will take baits readily only
at certain times, and that in some months it is
not worth while laying them. Is there any reason
behind that idea?
* * *
“Scrub Cutter”: “Morob,” who gives one
the impression that he knows what he is talking
about, claims (B. l/5/’24) that the theory that
cancer in the human species is caused by a living
organism is exploded; yet Sir Ray Lankester, in a
work published in 1920, says there is “a very high
probability” that a microbe is at the bottom of
the trouble, and he further states, when speaking of
a certain parasite which causes a disease somewhat
resembling cancer in mice and rabbits, that “it is
held by many investigators that some such parasite
—though not yet discovered—is the cause of cancer.”
What is a poor bush bloke to believe? Has the
explosion occurred since Ray Lankester wrote his
book, or is “Morob” mistaken?
* * * *
“J.A.” : The discussion began when refer-
ence was made to a man being
•poisoned through handling a dead
snake, and it brought out two
remarkable cases. A domestic in
the employ of a sugar-planter in
N. Queensland, on discovering that
a poisonous spider had spun a web
in her kitchen, applied -a lighted
candle to the structure. It flared
up and caused the spider to fall
into the molten fat. An explosion
followed, and some fragments
penetrated the woman’s eye, which
soon started to swell and showed
every indication of being poisoned.
The second case was that of a
bushman who while carrying his
towel preparatory to having a
wash, caught sight of a red-backed
spider near the basin, and, for
want of a more suitable weapon,
struck it with the towel. After
washing and drying himself an
open scratch on his hand suddenly
became painful, and it soon be-
came evident that poison had
been introduced.
* X-
“Billy the Bird” : The
little grey spider of Samoa is an
expert hunter. He inhabits win-
dows and such places, living in
the crevices and using the sill lor
a hunting-ground. He never
weaves a web—just stalks his vic-
tim, the small house-fly. . When
the fly alights on the sill the spider
comes from his crevice, moves
sideways and zigzags generally
until about six lengths of his body
are between himself and his vic-
tim ; then he jumps. He never
misses on the pounce; but often
the quarry anticipates the jump
and moves off to safety. In that
event the hunter stays rigid until
the fly returns—as he does almost
invariably—and then the spider is soon on the outside.
* * * *
Lobjc ’: “Yairs,” said Bill, dropping his
pick and staring reflectively at the horizon, “it was
’ard luck on old Charlie all right; but it was ’is
own fault. I warned ’im. I told ’im that these
city coves ’d be too flash for ’im, but he would ’ave
’is own way. When we’d got a decent little bit
of gold together from the crick over there Charlie
put his dust into the bank and drew his cheque,
but he took some of his nuggets to Melbourne,
where he reckoned he’d get a better price for ’em.
He said he knew a thing or two that ’d put the
kibosh on all the pickpockets, so he flattened out
his nuggets on the anvil, knocked holes in ’em, and
sewed ’em on to his trousers where the bracer but-
tons go.” “That seems a good idea,” I said admir-
ingly. Yairs,” said Bill, “but not good enough
for them Melbourne blokes. Old Charlie ’ad ’ardly
been in town five minutes when blime if ’is
trousers didn’t fall down, right in the middle of
Collins-street.”
THE ARITHMETIC LESSON—LIQUID MEASURE.
TEACHER: “If two cyclists started from a certain -point, one who could ride 25 miles an
hour at 10, and the other who could ride 30 miles an hour at 10.30, where
would they come together?”
BRIGHT KID: “Please, miss, at the first pub.”
“W.D.12”: Re “Hopalong's” dog that
couldn’t swim (B. 8/5/’24). A mate of mine brought
along his two fox-terriers one day when we went for
a dip. One took to the water promptly, but the other
had to be thrown in. Yelping mournfully, he started
to paddle. In a few moments it became obvious
that he could make no progress, and my mate had
to dive in and bring him ashore. That pup never
became a swimmer, and at best could only keep him-
self on the surface by “treading water.”
“Herodot”: The probabilities are that the
worm, twine and wheat grain found by “Sarah”
inside hens’ eggs (B. l/5/’24) got there by the
simple process of having the eggs formed around
them. More than likely the worm was not one of
the earth-variety, but was a parasitic inhabitant of
the hen, although in that case “Sarah’s” figures are
very large. The foreign objects having found their
way to the reproductive system of the fowl, it is
possible that they would act as a sort of nucleus
around which the egg would be built up, just as a
grain of sand, when placed in a saturated solution
of a chemical substance, will act as the foundation
on which quantities of the substance are deposited.
Such cases are extremely rare, but stranger objects
than those mentioned by “Sarah” have been found
in the interior of eggs—an ordinary carpenter’s nail
in one, and a threepenny bit in another.
* * * *
“J.G.”: “Nitric” (B. l/5/’24) notwith-
standing, “E.V.R.” was quite correct in saying that
wallabies would hop above bracken when pursued.
I have repeatedly seen them do it here in the bush
near Wallan (Vic.). It is nothing for some of them
to jump 4ft. high. As a general rule, when sur-
prised, they will try to fade away through the scrub;
but let a dog with any speed go after them, and
you will see the wallabies hop over bracken patches
and even big logs in their flight.
“Hecagus”: Jacky owned an elderly
bicycle, and when some practical joker hid it he
reported his loss to the local John Hop. The
latter started to jot down a description. “What
color that feller bike?” he asked. “Oh, mine tinkit
white, black, red,” explained the bereaved owner.
“Righto,” said the John. “Free wheel?” “No
fear,” was Jacky’s prompt reply; “only two wheel,
boss! ” |
* * » *
“Te W.”: The whale seems to have for-
saken Port Jackson; there is no recent, or even
comparatively recent, record of one entering the
harbor. In Governor Phillip’s time a sperm whale
entered, and was chased by some of our ancestors in
boats; but the harpooner lacked skill and the
leviathan escaped. A year or two later a punt
was pursued by a whale in the harbor, the craft
being upset and a midshipman and two soldiers of
the Sirius drowned. This whale, Collins records,
failed to find its way out and finally stranded $t
Manly, where it was killed and devoured by appre-
ciative aborigines. Phillip’s old abo. friend Bennil-
long sent the Governor a junk of whale meat as T a
present, but it is not recorded whether the gift
figured on the vice-regal table. All the whale flesh
I ever saw was dark, rank, oily and evil-smelling.
1 tried a junk once as flathead bait, but these fish
—usually not particular in matters of diet—would
have none of it.
* * » »
“Yarrum”: Yet another queer accident,
with a horseshoe for luck in it. Two brothers were
riding fast between Yerong Creek and Urangeline
(N.S.W.) when the leading horse cast a hind shoe.
The flying ironmongery struck the rear man in the
face and he fell, narrowly escaping being dragged.
Carried to a wayside house, it was fully an hour
before he regained consciousness.
“E.D.”: Spooner and Williams were
buried in a fall at the Band of Hope mine. They
were pent in a little space between the face and
a sloping wall of crumbled reef where the roof of
the drive had come in. On the other side of the
pile of broken timbers and mullock, half a dozen
miners labored like fiends, cheek-by-jowl with death,
seeking to effect a rescue. At any moment there
might be another fall which would whelm the rescue
party and settle the fate of the prisoners. But
luck was with them; Spooner and Williams were
dragged forth alive, and carried to a point of
safety before the second fall occurred. They heard
the thunder of it as they moved along the drive.
The first question Spooner asked was, “What’s the
time?” Someone told him it was 6 o’clock. “Great
gohannas!” he said. “Two hours late. Won’t the
missus go off pop!”
* * * *
“Fordson”: A jewfish recently caught here
(Toogoolawah, Q.) had only one eye. There was
no sign whatever of a second optic ever having
been in place. The fish was quite healthy and big.
Any of the Council know of a similar freak?
* * * *
“John Wellington”: One J. D. Ewes sent
a new one my way about the Maori when I recently
came across his book “China, Australia and the
Pacific Islands.” In this volume he quotes “an eye-
witness” of the ferocious Maori of earlier years, who
administered a sort of baptism to his children, and
during the ceremony forced small stones down the
throats of the infants with the idea of hardening
their hearts and making them inaccessible to pity.
I thought I had a passable knowledge of Henare’s
ways and manners when warfare Was his hobby, but
I seem to have missed this item.
TWO OF A KIND.
MR. GREEN: “Why don’t you ask Brown?”
MR. BLACK : “Oh, he's such an ass. He
agrees with everything I say.”
“Brud”: On the Lower Macquarie
(N.S.W.) lives an old hand who has put in the
best years of his life on Queensland and Mu
State cattle-stations, and he has one idea concerning
which I’d like to hear some comments from the
Council. He gives fattening bullocks an occa-
sional “stir-up” by racing them round the flat for
half an hour or so. The reasons that he gives
for the treatment are that it “opens up the pores of
the skin, develops the muscles, and keeps the bowels
in good working order.”
AN OLD FEUD.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“A Chinaman ran amok and killed a compatriot at
Innisfail (Q.). It was the result of an ancient feud
between their families going back to an old religious
quarrel in China, in the course of which the fore-
bears of the murderer had massacred the relatives of
the man guilty of the bloodshed at Innisfail last
week.”
From moist Innisfail
Comes a horrible tale
Of amok-running Mongol named Foon—
How with cleaver and knife
He ended the life
Of a brother-Mongolian called Coon.
A feud, it appears,
Going back many years
(Mebbe both had forgotten the date)
Had infected Ah Foon
With a hatred of Coon—
Quite a mossgrown traditional hate.
P’rhaps a grandsire of Foon
Scorned the clan of Ah Coon
And tabooed ’em as outside the pale;
So this gory tradition
(’Twas spawned in Perdition)
Found its sequel in moist Innisfail.
Now, ye Christians, draw near,
Let the moral appear
As a warning to those who’d arouse
Sectarian ire
And hatreds inspire:
Why, they’re nearly as bad as the Chows,
Dear boys—
Yes, very much worse than the Chows.

The most glittersome object at the United
Services Ball was the Governor-General, who
looked as silver-plated as a bride’s sideboard.
State Governor Sir Dudley walked the
quarter-deck of the Town Hall in full
admiral’s rig. In the m§l6e were the flash
of scarlet, the leaf-brown thrill of khaki and
enough Y.C.’s and decorations to put a girdle
round Australia. Flags floated from the
Town Hall entrance to the platform, and in
between hung pennants inscribed with names
of battles as stirring as the fanfare of trum-
pets that heralded the vice regal arrival.
The massed colors of A.I.F. battalions
guarded by Diggers glorified the platform;
and the clock gallery, propellers spread and
titivated with the R.A.A.F. badge, tried to
look like the last idea in airships.
Both vice-reines were present. Lady For-
ste.r was eye-sufficing in black and gold bro-
cade, worn to the accompaniment of pearl
and diamond ornaments. Sir Dudley’s lady
shone like a new penny in bronze silk velvets.
To this she added her beautiful pearls and
a white feather fan of the latest dimensions.
Mrs. Pitt Rivers emerged in beauty from one
of those Rue de la Paix models which she
evolves from paper patterns in her spare
moments. Major-General Brand’s wife, in
a souffle of pink and silver, presented six
newly-fledged debs, to vice-royalty. Grey
softness clothed the Lieut.-Gov.’s lady; and
General Rosenthal’s wife wore rich black
trappings. Mrs. Feakes was glance-arrest-
ing in faintly blushing silk; and Mrs. Yale
brought daughter Phyllis, who made her first
social flight in pale pink georgettes.
The Conference of the Country Women’s
Association at Moree wasn’t all hard work
and tough problems. In greeting the visi-
tors the Mayor _ said he regretted he could
not give the ladies the freedom of the town,
but he could and would give them the free-
dom of the baths. And every morning the
visitors formed a procession, in ’bus and
car and buggy, and drove to and from the
bore. They soon became known as the
Companions of the Bath; and limes Noad
and Albert Wcarne were, of course, the
Knights Commanders. The big things deter-
mined on were the breaking up of N. S.
Wales into three divisions, with a president
apiece, and the bringing of training in
mothercraft and maternity hospitals closer
to the women of the ’Wayback. How keen
the country mother is to get expert advice
about the feeding of baby was proved by the
scores who, with but a glance into the room
where the conference sat, passed on to the
room where the trained nurse from town
weighed small Australians from morning till
night and advised mothers as to the nourish-
ing of their offspring.
The country woman’s large capacity for
“making things do” was illustrated at some
election or other during the Conference.
Nobody had brought a ballot-box; and one
couldn’t be unearthed in the neighborhood.
Then were produced a gauze-covered milk-
can and a gauze-covered kerosene-tin which
one enthusiast had brought to the meeting
to show a point in the fight against flies
and dirt. Into these the votes were dropped,
and the proceedings went on their lily-pure
way.
The number of snowballs that whizzed
about the Wentworth the other evening gave
the atmosphere no chill; rather they seemed
to jolly the mercury up a bit, and that was
all to the good. Snowballs with lucky num-
bers tucked within were trafficked among the
dancers ; and snowball dips swallowed more
coin, to disgorge it presently into the purse
of the Kindergarten Union. But the hit of
the night was the plump mass of feathery
white that held in its heart pretty girlet
Phyllis Du Barry, like some captive Snow
Maiden, until everybody had guessed (at a
shilling a pop) what secret the big ball held.
Mr% Vincent McCauley, herself glittering
like a Rhine maiden in opalescent sequins,
was the clever person whose word set the
bondmaid free. Chief Justice Cullen’s lady,
who was president of the dance, was serene
above the whisper of pearl-grey georgettes.
Mrs. E. W. Fenner was secretary in black
velvet, and little Mrs. Gore-Jones com-
bined capability with daffodil frocking knotted
at the waist with demure blue ribands.
There are great doings at the Uni. this
week; and all the ways lead towards the 49
war memorial bells that are to ring out over
Sydney before the end of next year. To-
night there is to be a conversazione “to meet
the graduates of 1901-10,” and to-morrow
the undergrads, will run a fete to produce (if
you’ll oblige them) a round £lO,OOO. Profes-
sors are helping—you will scarcely find a
corner where some learned person is not
brewing knowledge of which the public may
buy deep draughts for next to nothing.
Professor Bruce (just back from Europe)
will take his listeners through Renaissance
Italy; P'rof. Nicholson will escort you
through famed bits of Paris ; Prof. Robinson
and Jessie Webb will “do” ancient Rome
and Greece. The Fisher Library will be
thrown open. Japanese curios and Japanese
lectures will give your education that extra
polish; and, finally, you may bid, like a
perfect lady, at the auction in the Quad, at
night.
Lady Forster sounded the tocsin in the
cause of the Children’s Hospital and the
Crown-street Hospital for Women, and the
result was a crowded meeting at Admiralty
House to proffer aid for the Movie Ball.
But all that the film people had left for the
helpers to do was to sell tickets. The ball
will be held at the Palais Royal on June 19.
and the Governor-General’s lady will be its pre-
sident. After the meeting Clarence Moss, of
the Children’s Hospital, demonstrated a tor-
pedo in action against a cruiser—the devas-
tating toy can be bought for os. in the inter-
ests of the Royal Alexandra. Then there
was tea and talk, Lady Forster hostessing in
a gentle smile and soft leaf-brown.
Midway through last week the annual
Dominican re-union brightened up the Went-
worth. The committee had worked hard, and
the success of the evening was a lot depen-
dent on the efforts of the band of old girls
and young matrons whose badge was a floral
armlet from which flew streamers of the
black-and-white of the Dominicans.
The Eastern bazaar to help the poor
Armenians filled St. James’s on Friday with
glowing colors. These and the attractive cos-
tumes of the stallholders —they were in the
Armenian national dress —were thrown into
relief by the black-and-gold decorations of
the hall. The stock-in-trade was unusual and
very beautiful. There were robe and jumper
lengths strikingly embroidered by the hands
of Armenian girls, who, in addition, had
grown and dyed the silks with which they
wove the designs. Cobwebby hankies and
lacy d’oyleys were other delights, not to
speak of hand towels that this Letter would
trust very few of its guests with. Professor
David’s wife and Mayor Gilpin took turns
in uttering the proper sentiments in declar-
ing the afternoon and evening sessions open.

in the public eye. For the first time the
girl undergrads are playing a part equal
to the men’s in the Commem. celebrations,
and sharing equally the burden of to-morrow’s
big fete. The takings from this go to help
pay for the Bells of Blackfriars. > When
not busy with Uni. matters, Nessie engineers
a tennis club on her native North Shore.
Mrs. Broomfield has rejoined her K.C. and
the family after 18 months’ travel in Europe,
India, China, Japan and Korea. Wherever
she went she met notables, and each notable
passed her on with letters to another. In
this way she met Mussolini, his right-hand
man, Baron Rossi (who put off two ambas-
sadors to talk to the lady from Australia—
that country of new ideas”), and the oic-
turesque Morosini, patrician of Venice. *No
man-made title of Prince, Duke or Count to
lessen the sublime arrogance of the mere
name—Morosini! It represents one of the
oldest palaces on the Grand Canal, and a
family tree whose roots go down beyond the
Middle Ages. Four doges and innumerable
cardinals (one of them an intimate of that
interesting fellow Marco Polo) have used
these marble steps, wrapped in the cloaks
of soft embossed leather or stiff embroid-
eries that now lie in the treasure chests of
the palace.
t> In n l <lon ’ in s l ,ite of the talk, Mrs.
Broomfield found no real revival in the arts.
Concerts are but sparsely attended, while
tlie night clubs and jazz halls are overflow-
ing. In Italy, of course, the opera is still
a live thing; Toscanini conducting a star
cast in La Scala fills tier upon tier of boxes
with eager listeners in luscious frocking and
marvellous jewels. In London she met Bert-
ram Maekennal, and in Rome Dora Ohlfssen,
who has been given one of the biggest sculp-
ture commissions of the year—for a war
memorial. Dora’s work represents a Roman
soldier, naked to the waist, the rest of him
equipped in the modern soldier kit, tin hel-
met and everything. He is standing, tense,
arms flung upwards. Miss Ohlfssen has
done portrait medallions of Mussolini and
half the notabilities of the Eternal City.
Since her return Mrs. Broomfield has been
busy moving to the farm they have bought
at Rooty Hill. Their days will be spent
between it and the Darling Point flat.
The young man in the picture alongside is
Eric Langker, now making one of the most
interesting art
exhibitions of
the year at
the Hordern
Gallery. It is
only three
years since he
began to ex-
hibit, but he
is regarded as
one of the
strongest
painters in the
younger
group. He is
the youngest
member on
the council of
the Royal
Art Society,
and to him
falls the task
of organising
the art-stu-
dents’ festive
flutters. His brush has been coquetting with
scenic art of late, and he designed some of
the scenes for Judge Beeby’s “Five Nights
in ’Frisco,” produced the other week by the
Playbox Society.
Mrs. Beatrice Macdonald will deserve a
special pair of wings if she carries out her
plans to cope with the domestic problem.
She intends going to England to arrange
for a constant supply of trained help to be
drafted to Australia under the scheme of the
Domestic Immigration Society. But she will
not leave Sydney, she insists, until there
is a hostel ready to receive the girls on arri-
val. Priminister Bruce approves the idea
and has given the missionary letters passing
her on to the tender mercies of the High Com-
missioner and Australia House. Another
introduction she carries is to Margaret Bond-
field, and through her the Sydney woman
hopes to get into touch with women’s organ-
isations abroad. The Highland Society’s
rooms were crowded with enthusiasts the
other day when the Domestic Immigrationists,
under the presidential eye of Mrs. B. M.
Sly, met to discuss progress and Pekoe.
Mrs. Edwin. Ryrie’s Titian-haired girl
Betty danced into something like fame a
few weeks ago at the age of 16. She got her
chance at Nice, and was “commanded” a
couple of evenings later to perform before
the Duke of Connaught and the King of
Sweden at the villa where the latter was
staying. She returned to her mother in
London with a sheaf of contracts to appear
in Paris, Vienna and Berlin. Dorothy, the
elder girl, has a small part in George Gros-
smith’s new London show.
Sculptor Nelson Illingworth’s latest com-
missions are life-size relief-portraits of the
State Excellencies, Sir Dudley and his lady.
Bronze relief-portraits are the latest craze
in England and America, and Sir Dudley
was very taken with examples shown at
Mr. Illingworth’s last exhibition.
Captain Feakes and his good-looking wife
are leaving Australia on Monday next, and
will be away for about two years on what
the naval people vaguely call “transfer.”
Engineer-Commander Ross goes away, too,
on the same business. But he has a bonny
wife and infants at the other end.
Orange lost its only baronet on Friday,
when Sir Herbert Ramsay, who has had a
house in the town for the past couple of
years, passed quietly out. He was 66 and
had been ill for some time. The baronetcy
it not one of the wealthy ones, and the late
holder of the title had worked hard in busi-
ness for close on 40 years. Sir Alexander
Ramsay, the new bart., is only 21, and is
employed by a local firm of solicitors.
Harry Osborne, of Currandooley, gave a
dinner-dance at the Ambassadors on Satur-
day night for his two sons, who have just
arrived in Australia to go on the land. They
have been educated in England—-at Harrow
—and one was in a cavalry regiment for a
time, so their knowledge of the Useful animal
which is responsible for the family fortunes
is not excessive. However, if heredity
counts for anything they should learn, and
with that end in view father is putting each
of them on a far-outbaek station.
Another prospective squatter is Berry,
elder son of the Alex. Hays. He has been at
Winchester and Cambridge, and will finish his
education as a jackeroo. on one of Otway
Falldner’s stations. S'
Stefansson stepped off the Sonoma on
Tuesday into the arms of Professor David
and other brethren of the Royal Society.
The Millions Club spread mid-day nourish-
ment for him on Wednesday, and to-morrow
(Friday) he’ll get a snack at the Institute
of Journalists’ luncheon to Irene Vanbrugh
and Dion Boucicault.
Three plays by members of the Lyceum
Club have now been heard in the Friday
Reading Circles. Last week Mrs. Robert
Williams read “The Song’s Ending,” by Nora
McAuliffe. It is in three acts and is an
unorthodox story of Sheba and Solomon.
One night last week The Bulletin’s old
friend Norman Campbell, inky wayfarer and
one-time actor, gave the members of the
Shakspeare Society an intimate talk about
some Shakspearean actors Australia has seen.
President W. F. Jackson said it was the
most telling and effective lecture they had
listened to. Nellie Stewart came to hear her
former stage manager- So did Alfred Rolfe,
Lily Dampier’s husband and himself a
prominent Shakspearean actor, and the lec-
turer’s actress-wife, Nella Campbell, was
also in the audience. The society has
asked Mr. Campbell to repeat his lecture in
a larger hall.
Judge Murray, Lieut.-Governor of Papua,
has been bestowing a fatherly blessing on
younger son Patrick. The lady in the case
is Margery Holland, of Summer Hill, and
she brings a B.Sc. of Sydney Uni. to jingle
against the young man’s Sydney and Oxford
B.Sc.
Another engagement is that of Joyce
Strang, youngest bud of the John Strangs
of Garthowen, Castle Hill, to Pearson, only
son of the Norman Suttors of Bathurst.
The grounds of Myola, the Clifton Gar-
dens home of the John Mackays, will deck
themselves with booths and festive bunting
next Saturday, when a sale of work wall
help the exchequer of the Little Citizens’
Kindergarten. Gifts for the stalls can be
left at the Feminist Club.
In one of the big Sydney clubs it is a re-
cognised condition that any member who
attains a certain financial status shall mount
an eyeglass. This does not apply to the
aged, but most of the more or less youthful
plutocrats have conformed. The tally of the
monocled has so swelled of late —including
several who are barely able to hold glasses
in their eyes without requisitioning their
hands—that a kind of imperium in imperio
is being formed in the shape of an Eyeglass
Club. The idea is for members to dine to-
gether once a week, and at least maintain
their eyeglasses in position while the loyal
toast is being drunk, if it is not practicable
to do so throughout the meal. The only
opposition is from insurance men, who argue
that their companies should not be held liable
for accidents to members half-blinded by the
unaccustomed ornaments.
The members of the Queen’s Club are
polishing up the family jewels for then-
annual ball. This year the chilly Palais will
present an appropriate background for their
merriment. But decorations!—£.3so they in-
tend to spend on these alone! Only really
nice people invited. No press and no princes!
On June 4 the Czecho-Slovakian Consul
will lecture on his country, and then we’ll
find out that we knew it as Bohemia better
than we thought. Lantern slides and national
songs will enliven the talk; and, the lecture
being under the wing of the National Coun-
cil of Women, Lady Forster will preside.
The Duke of Westminster, who is the latest
peer to get rid of his most saleable family-
heirlooms and let his chief tow-n house, w-as
supposed to be one of the half-dozen richest
men in the world when he married 23 years
ago. He owns 600 acres of London, most of
it in Belgravia. When all the leases fall
in the income of this dukedom will be incal-
culable. Meanwhile the present holder of
the. title, who is famed as an admirer of the
ladies, has never had enough money for his
many needs. His wife divorced him in 1919
and he married an heiress—the only daugh-
ter of Sir William Nelson —the following
year. But his mortgages still pursue him.
An elder sister is Countess Beauchamp, the
wife of our one-time Seidlitz-powder Gov-
ernor.
The dour Scots’ Church on Church Hill,
Sydney, where once Dr. Lang mixed reli-
gion and militant patriotism, was the sub-
ject of discussion at the Assembly last week:
a petition was presented from the trustees
asking leave to sell out. The historic bethel,
hemmed in by business sites, has now a
scanty congregation and a big mortgage,
and it takes a good deal of a struggle to
keep going. But the Assembly did not like
the idea of parting with the local cradle of
Presbyterianism, and decided to decline the
petition but lighten the burden.
A pair of blankets 104 years old are in
the possession of a Bylong family. They
were not Australian-made —the people who
own them emigrated to Australia from the
Cotswold Hills', in Gloucestershire. There
is a good deal of linen in Australia many
years older than that, mostly a product of
the Irish industry which the machine
looms of Manchester killed. A recent Waver-
ley bride received a gift of linen which was
embroidered with the date 1721, and had
been in the constant use of her grandmother’s
family for nobody knows how long.

Melba keeps the interest of these opera
nights simmering by her own fervid demon-
strations of goodwill. Leaning out of her
d.c. eyrie she bestows applause on the pant-
ing principals, and has them kissing their
hands in response. Conductor Paolantonio
always comes in for his share of approval,
and the , other night after he had piloted the
band through Mascagni’s Intermezzo the
dame showered him with bravos, and would
have probably soared to bravissima if she
had, thought of it. Melba’s own acceptance
of admiration is just as naif and artless as
that of her comparatively untried colleagues.
A warm greeting is still as much to her as
it was when she revealed her soprano to the
world years ago in Brussels. In her time
she must have received mountains of flowers,
but. a few bouquets at a recent matinhe
seemed greater than rubies, because they
had come from humble adorers. In the
violence of her emotion she threw a little
posy at a wounded soldier, and the gesture,
which might have looked artificial from an
ordinary actress, really touched the house,
which never doubted its idol’s sincerity.
All the women seemed to have best-dressed
themselves for “Pagliacci” and “Cavalleria.”
The vice-regal Countess and daughter
Helena warmed themselves in twin coatings
of white bunny. Sir Tom Bridges, with a
gent.-help, sat with Dame Nellie, and Lord
Stradbroke blew in during the interval to
exchange compliments. The Harry Emmer-
tons saw the show from the Norton Grim-
wades’ pen. The flowers handed over the
footlights were reinforced by boxes of choco-
lates for the ladies and a basket of cham-
pagne for one of the male singers. Women
who* bidden to night weddings, have fretted
over St. Paul’s injunction to women to wear
liats, had the problem solved for them by the
peasant girls in “Cavalleria,” who slipped
their neckerchiefs over their heads as they
marched through the church door. Sca-
vizzi's patrician beauty shone out above her
picturesque peasant rig as Santuzza. Con-
cato’s Columbine skirts of yellow scrolled
over with black under a black and mauve
neck ruffle lacked attractiveness, but the
rig was not so depressingly ugly as her
second effort of cretonne flounces under a
green velvet corsage.
The popular Barcarolle helped to draw
the crowd to “The Tales of Hoffmann” on
Saturday night, and almost as many were
turned away as were squeezed into the house.
Countess Stradbroke was there, of course
(she had spent the previous morning at the
dress rehearsal, too), and in her party was
Prof. Archie Strong, who is over from Adel-
aide spending a vacation in this city. The
Dick Casey widow was boxed with a group,
which included son Dermot and his soon-to :
be bride, Gwynnedd Browne. Argus editor
Cunningham and his wife sat with friends
in a lower pen. The doctor unbent suffi-
ciently to cast a posy at Scavizzi, but his
conservative estimate of distance landed it
plunk into the orchestra. Melba, who looked
as if she had sheeted herself in flame, had
some feminine pals in her allotment. When
Borgioli took his final curtain with Vera
Bedford, no less than three laurel wreaths
were showered on him, and a chuckle went
round when the tenor was further loaded
with some ribbon-decked vegetation and a
flower-filled basket. An Englishman would
have met the situation by handing the trifles
to the lady, but Borgioli, looking rather
sheepish, grabbed the offerings and made a
hasty exit. The dress architect had done
his worst for the Toti Dal Monte doll with
silk flounces of a bilious green outlined with
a darker shade, and the biliousness was ex-
tended to a coal-scuttle bonnet. Aga
Lahoska was alluring as the courtesan, in
an Empire frock of gold satin, veiled with a
glittering film. Lina Scavizzi. as Hoffmann’s
last and consumptive love, looked like the
angel she was to be in shimmering white
draperies with floating sleeves. Vera Bed-
ford made a fine gallant in blue satin knee-
breeches, white periwig and brocaded coat;
but she hadn’t the gait which goes with
the duds.
Glare, the youngest daughter of the medical
-Talbot Bretts, was married at St. Martin’s,
Hawksburn, the other morning to William
pufheld, of Tasmania, son of the late Charles
Duffield, of Cairo (Egypt). Although there
was a minimum of fuss about the affair,
Bishop Halford was beckoned in to help
Vicar Greene adjust the knot. Dr. Brett,
with his wife and three daughters, lived be-
hind his Collins-street brass-plate until the
dental invasion sent the best-known practi-
tioners to private homes in the suburbs, and
for some years now the Bretts have in-
habited a Big white house on the old Como
estate. A few days before the wedding the
bride was cheered by Mrs. .Tack O'Brien and
her sister, Ida Knight, with a joyous lunch -
party at the Alexandra Club.
English-speaking Union enthusiasts, led by
the Harold Clapp and Corry Gardner
matrons, ran a double-barrelled bridge party
in the Harry Einmertons’ reception-parlors the
other afternoon and evening. The cards flut-
tered at 80 tables, with an opulent backing
of autumn blooms; and a sumptuous after-
noon tea, given by Mrs. Emmerton, was a
billiard-room extra. A further strain on the
purse-strings was provided by a flower and
chocolate-selling campaign. Though the
afternoon gathering was a feminine one,
Speaker Willie Watt, as Union president,
plunged into the petticoated sea to make a
speech, in which he dwelt on the need for
club-rooms where oversea visitors might get
a taste of Australian hospitality. J. A. M.
Elder, who is to succeed Donald Mackinnon
at Washington, had a little say on the
matter _ at the evening session. 'The star
attraction at night was the five-shilling hot-
supper extra, generously provided by the
Emmerton pair. Those with lean purses
hastily claimed to have souls above late
feeds, and fled home to raid the domestic
larder. The Groom and Richard Einton
matrons were chiefs of the brigand band,
Mrs. Arthur Oldham, who was to have made
a third, being kept away by illness; and
the rank and file of highway-women in-
cluded Mrs. Bob Staugliton, Ted Dyson's
wife and the De Bavay sisters. All the Best
Known were there, and Mrs. Harold Clapp
and the hon. sec., Babbie Bridges, beamed
when they found that the takings will run
into well over £3OO. This ought to lay a
splendid foundation for the club-rooms that
had been talked about.
Airmen Goble and Mclntyre, back from
t.ieir round-Australia flight, plumped right
into a nest of official welcomes. Defence
Minister Bowden lined up his lot at the end
of the flag-decked pier; spotlighted in that
group were Mrs. Goble, senior, and her
daughter. After a beach landing the cap-
tain and his lieutenant dashed for a yacht,
whereon baby John Goble, convoyed by his
mother and maternal grannie, was clapping
hands for daddy to a running accompani-
ment of his own chuckles, and an aunt
waited to greet nephew Mclntyre. Re-land-
liig on the pier, the two received blessings
from the Defence Minister, the State Gov-
ernor, the Mayor and Senator Pearce. There-
after they were borne shoulder-high to take
St. Kilda's civic greetings. Wearily push-
ing off the waiting reporters on the" ground
of being tired out, the pair took some
minor welcomes and crawled home for the
first real sleep since they started out.
The lady looking out from this Lafayette
photo is the wife of Dr. John Quick,
the Federal Arbitration Deputy-Judge, who
recently left Bendigo to settle in Mel-
bourne. With
a fine gift for
organisa-
tion, and
keenly inter-
ested in phil-
anthropic
work, she is
having a busy
time these
days as presi-
de n t of the
Melbourne
H o s p i t al’s
newly - formed
League of
Social Service,
which is out
to help the in-
stitution in
every way it
can. The lady
opened up the
guild’s activi-
. , . ties with
an introductory tea, later on staged a
dance, and with her co-workers is planning
further ways and means of keeping the big
institution’s pot boiling.
The spinster sister of S.A.’s Governor
lorn Bridges, who appears to have made a
T\'r lu IHSSum world-travelling, halted in
Melbourne for one day last week, on her way
to join her brother at Adelaide. She recently
pushed herself into Papuan history bycross-
ing a stretch of jungle country which had
hitherto not echoed to the dainty tread of a
vlnte woman. She did it under convoy of
halt a dozen dusky minions of the law and a
posse of native-bearers after Lieut.-Governor
Murray had mapped out the track for her.
Maybe she will later put the story of the
journey in a book.
A nicely-equipped party drifted into a per-
formance of Boheme” the other night, all
hushed with anticipatory smiles of enjoy-
ment Presumably none of them troubled to
search the programme for the story, for after
Game Nellie had coughed her way through
the first act as the consumptive Mimi, one
of the group was heard to lament: “Isn’t it
just our luck to come here when Melba has
a . bad cold !” “But,” cried another, “isn’t it
simply tconderful of her to be able to sing at
all with a cough like that?”
The Lawn Tennis Association cheerfully
punctuated the inter-State ’Varsity matches
with a one-step in the Kooyong Club-house,
tangerine light-dimmers shed a golden glow
oa ae wall panels, from every avail*
able angle of which autumn blooms nodded
colorfully. The overflow whirled picturesquely
on the wide verandah, which linked the jazz
floor with the moon-bathed lawns below,
v ere de Bavay, whose slim fingers had fixed
the decorations, trotted becomingly in white
satin hemmed in with gold embroideries, and
Mrs. Eric Connolly was in filmy sea-green.
Esna Boyd and Mavis Mclvor were among
the. champion racquet-holders present; and
Colin Harper convoyed his wife, who is tak-
ing a fresh header into the social swirl from
the end of the sick-list.
Meet Eileen Starr, the Auburn girl with
the sweet-toned and long-ranged soprano whom
Henry Russell
lias tipped for
a place among
the grand-opera
stars. He
wanted her to
make a hurried
packing and
join Muriel
Benton in
crossing t o
Europe with
him, but she
decided to take
her time and
follow on more
c o m f ortably.
Eileen, who is
a scholarship
winner, is at
present having
her voice
shaped at the
Melba Cp n-
s e r v a toriurn
and she lias , already proved herself a brainy
damsel, a qualification which will help her
considerably in her climb up the operatic
ladder. It was Broothorn who made this
picture of the song-bird.
The Everard Brownes’ elder daughter,
Gwynnedd, and the Richard Caseys’ younger
hope, Dermot, are tottering under the weight
of the good wishes pouring upon them from all
quarters because they have given the word
that means the ordering of cake and con-
fetti for September. After the wedding they
will go to the U.S.A., where he will decorate
the staff of the new Commissioner, J. A,
Elder. Young Dermot served in a British
regiment during the war, and came out of
it with a captaincy and an M.C, Unlike
her blonde mother (formerly Muffle Chirn-
side), the bride-elect is a brunette, her dark-
eyed attractiveness being a heritage from
her father. The latter, by the way, is still
an invalid after the driving accident which
nearly cost him his life; but he progressed
so well last year that he was able to enjoy
a trip to Ceylon under convoy of his wife
and daughter. He is a son of novelist Rolf
Boldrewood Browne, struck success in both
mining and sheep-growing, and is about the
most popular sport Melbourne has ever
known.
A tremendous battle raged over the Sand-
ringham links last week when the skirted
players captained by Mrs. Jimmie Gate-
house scored a stunning victory over their
male opponents. After clubs had been
downed the opposing armies shed their
sporting tweeds and climbed into glad
rags for a gay dinner in the club-house.
This was followed by some fox-trotting, and
later the jazzing section motored to Black
Rock to top off the cheerio at the local dance
palace. Among the players were the veteran
Hugh Ross, club sec. Tom Huggins, Foster
Rutledge, Ernest McCaughan, Mona
MacLeod, Nan Guthrie, Dorothy Mollison
and Dr. Glassford.
A much-needed cheque will flutter into
the money-box of the Brighton C. of E.
Children’s Homes as the result of a splen-
didly-organised dance in the Glenferrie
Palace on Thursday night. Mrs. Ernest
Robinson engineered the thing, and others
helped to weight the purse with the takings
of a stall loaded up with novelties. These
homes are run in two sections, one for child-
ren who have been committed by the law;
the other for babies. The members of the
smaller group are eventually passed on to
foster-mothers selected with due care by the
committee. The place is homey, has a pic-
turesque little chapel of its own. and nice
grounds for the little ones to sun themselves
in. Financial help is now called for, and if
any charitably-disposed person cares to send
goods in kind they wall be transported free
by rail to Middle Brighton.
Mrs. J. A. Elder, whose husband takes

Commissioner in Washington and New York,
is one of the best liked of Melbourne matrons.
Her people belong to ,T. M. Barrie’s Scottish
home-town of Kirriemuir. She has circled the
globe more than once, and has a fairly inti-
mate knowledge of Uncle Sam and his big

health since the loss of her only daughter,
Isabel, who died as the result of an accident,
a couple of years back.
A little gossip from Adelaide »
The Girl Guides •gave a cinema show in the 'Town
Hall, with a Guide film manufactured In England
about three years ago as the star item. Society,
headed by the Bridges, the Chief Justice and Miss
Murray, filled the circle and put in a busy time m
the intervals buying sweets and flowers. Miss
Judge was organiser, with Mrs. George Cowan and
a couple of other Guide enthusiasts to help her.
Proceeds are for the Children’s Hospital, since
entertainments to raise money for their own funds
are taboo by Guide law.
Clifford Lathlean’s farewell concert and the Vie.
League’s opening lecture for the season fell on
the same evening, but both attracted bumper houses.
Prof. Coleman Phillipson was the lecturer, and he
had “Wit and Humor” as his subject and Josiaii
Symon, K.C., as his chairman. Clifford Lathlean,
who goes to join Branseombe in Queensland and is
then bound for Eastern Asia before settling down
to further study in London, booked Maud Buddy,
Harold Parsons and George Pearce to help him with
his programme; and all of them were in top form.
There has been a Conservatorium concert, too—
the fourth given by the students this winter. A
vocal trio by Jean Sinclair, Elise Cook and Alice
Savage was a conspicuous item.
The Chamber of Commerce conference brought
an inundation of inter-State visitors, a reception
by the Glovers at the Town Hall, motor drives
through the hills, and teas and luncheons galore.
One tea was at the Lavington Bonythons’ Mount
Lofty home, and the lunches included an affair at the
Seppelts’ at Tanunda.
The School of Arts and Crafts exhibition tells oi
the excellent work the school is doing, in needle-
work and china-painting, carving and modelling,
painting and enamelling. Native flora and fauna
bulk large in the designs, particularly in poster
work and on china.
His Ex.’s sister, Miss Philippa Bridges, is stay-
ing at Government House again after a jaUht to
Papua and Rabaul. She has seen something of
Tasmania, too, and lias a special word of praise
for the beauties of its bird and animal sanctuaries.
His Ex. got back from Melbourne in tiitte to do
a round of schools and say a word concerning Empire
Day.
The Bach Society is bemoaning the loss of Arthur
Mellor, who has been the sec. since its foundation
22 years ago. A gold watch and a wallet of bank
notes are the symbols of its gratitude.
There have been a couple of at-homes at Birks-
gate, the Barr Smiths’ beautiful home tucked into
the foothills above Glen Osmond. 'The just-artrtotinced
engagement of the third of the Barr Smith daughters,
Molly, to the Glen Legoes’ only son gave ilii extra
flutter to both frivols, and she —-oile of the most
popular of the younger set—was avalanched with
congratulations.
A Brisbane postscript:—
The Authors and Artists’ Association has raptured
a clubroom at the Wattle Cafe, and the other even-
ing a gathering of highbrows and their friends
passed a merry hour there. Several amateur artists
did lightning sketches and played the piano
and sang; sketches and water-colors by Elnis, Ash-
ton Murphy, E. Colclough, Hart and others adorned
the walls. Those who came to look and listen
included poetess Emily Bulcock and her chick,
M. Forrest and hers, Steele Rudd and his dark-haired
daughter, the E. S. Jacksons, Cumbrae Stewarts an i
Prof. Stable.
At His Majesty’s Gertrude Elliott still draws
brimming houses. And the same evening that she
put on “Smilin’ Through” Lena Hammond and
Gladys Frost filled the Albert Hall with their re-
cital ; and sweets and flowers pretty nearly filled the
stage before the performance closed. Lena wore
cyclamen embossed panne georgette brocaded in gold.
Gladys, always a charming froeker, was in almond-
green with a gorgeous overdress of jade and gold.
Sir Matthew is still away, and the last news of
him is that he has been eating with shire council-
lors at the Imperial, Longreach. He also addressed
the Country Women’s Assoc, at Longreach after
rushing through from Boulia in a ear. Meantime
Lady Patricia Blackwood and Lilias Waldegrave are
putting up at Government House.
The wife of acting J*render Gillies tea-ed Gertrude
Elliott at the Bellevue, amid a perfect flower-show of
Iceland poppies and red and yellow dahlias. A
floral cushion of maiden-hair and crimson, mauve and
purple sweet-peas centred the star guest’s table, with
a book about the Barrier Reef under it for her. Lady
Forbes-Robertson was in navy with grey stitchings
and grey astrakhan ; the hostess was sheathed in brown
wool marocain. A bunch of pink roses was sent to
Jean Forbes-Robertson, who was busy at rehearsal.
Dorothy Slade King chose St. Mark’s, Warwick, to
plight her troth to Ronald Challinor, of Brisbane.
She was in white and silver, with a Limerick veil,
and carried a bunch of crimson roses. Papa King
gave her away, Noel King (in lavender) brides-
maided, and Major Chatham best-manned. The
reception was at Ledbergh.
A recent Downs wedding was that of Isobel
Cameron, daughter of the Wellcamp Camerons, to
Cuthbert Griffin. Alan Cameron gave away the
bride, who was in cinnamon-brown embroidered in
autumn shades, with a saxe-blue coat; Helen Cameron
bridesmaided, and the T. S. Swords’ home saw the
feasting.
The widow of Ted Harris is down from Yokohama,
where she has been putting her affairs in order prior
to changing her name to McCauley—he’s a shipping
man. Blue-eyed daughter Patrice goes to Grandma

THROUGH all their centuries the beautiful interiors
of famous European castles and palaces have known
no finish but wax. Perfectly preserved—the waxed
wood mellows and glows with the years. This same
beautiful finish can be easily duplicated on the floors,

WAX
Johnson’s Wax is the ideal finish and polish for all your
floors. It will make them beautiful—easy to care for—
they won’t be slippery—and will not heel-print. And
Johnson’s Polishing Wax is, by far, the most economical
finish for floors and linoleum. With waxed floors
expensive refinishing is never necessary, for walked-on
places can be easily and quickly rewaxed as worn spots
appear, without going over the entire floor.
The easy way to wax floors and linoleum is with a
Johnson Weighted Polishing Brush. It spreads the Wax
evenly— polishes the Floor easily—and is an ideal
floor duster.

S.A. Jockey Club had a record total of
£115,000 through the totalisator for the three
days of the Adelaide Cup meeting, in spite of bad
weather on the last afternoon. Melbourne jockeys
were much in demand, and very successful, but
local owners won all the money. Wynette and Textile
were visitors trained in Victoria, but both were bred
in S.A., and their owners live there. The Adelaide
Racing Club week, with an almost identical pro-
gramme, follows immediately. In the City Handi-
cap, 7 furlongs (May 31), St. Speed, with 9st.
101 b., gives Leahcim a pound. Denacre won in 1922
with 9st., and again last year with lOst. 21b., but
has not improved of late and is now in at 9st. lib.
In the Birthday Cup, 1 mile 5 furlongs (June 7),
St. Speed and Leahcim are level at the top with 9st.
21b. Stand By, the desperate failure of the Adel-
aide Cup, for which he started a hot favorite, is
given another chance at the same weight, Bst. 51b.
At City Tatt.’s meeting at Randwick no
less than four favorites rolled home, and McHebrew
was heard proclaiming that it was the worst day
the ring had experienced for years. By winning the
Flying after making all his own running, Braehead
(9st. lllb.) strengthened his right to rank among our
top-notch sprinters. Capably handled by J. King,
the Mountain King colt gallantly staved off a final
challenge from the unlucky Trimacre, who ran such
a brilliant second to Whittier in the Doncaster. A
country performer, Tong Bong, by the Welkin horse
Three, won Tattersall’s Stakes with J. Munro up,
and this horseman had another win in the next race
(the Two-Year-Old Handicap) on Prutation. Cadeza
and Auction filled the places. Purser’s sister Note,
who has been out of the winning list for some
time, beat a weak field in the Empire Day Handicap,
scoring from Royal Howard and Polycletan, while
Nygee, Fair Rosaleen and Vertumnus, all outsiders,
filled the places in the Welter.

Brisbane’s £lOOO seven-furlong sprint at
Albion Park on Saturday was a joyous event for the
paddock bookmakers; none of the leger one’s fielded
as a protest against the B.A.T.C. Of the 17 starters,
11 were shorter in the market than the first three,
Clairvaux (Bernard —-Camooweal), The Whalan and
Gay Song. Twenties were on offer against each of
the trio. The distance was cut out in lmin. 31see.
Even while the N. S. Wales pony racing
commission is dragging its costly and futile length
along comes the cynical announcement that the A.R..C.
has decided to revert to all-day racing. The practice
is a public scandal and a notorious source of crime,
which was why it was abandoned some time back.
But the Government professes to be impotent, and the
pony authorities don’t care what the reputable section
of the community thinks so long as they can rake
in the shekels from the undesirables and half-wits
who form such a large proportion of their patrons.
* * * *
“Harold Hardupp”: When A. J.C. sec.
Cropper said that no man makes money by punting
he ignored the pros., some of whom have earned
food and beer at this game all their useless lives.
Their methods are various. One, for instance, picks
his horses when the entries are out and long prices
are obtainable, and hedges and rehedges so that
when the race is run he is sure of a profit whatever
wins. Another p.-p. boasts that he would not think
of touching anything until the day before the race.
But the one thing common to all is a tremendous
“turnover” designed to show a small but cei’tain
profit. In this direction lies security. The ruined
bettor is the product usually of the delusion that
a fortune can be made in a hit.
“Nitric”: Lionel E. Walker, who has gone
out at 62, was a life member of the Q. Turf Club
(there are only three others) and had been a
Tattersall’s Club committeeman for years.
He owned the speedy filly Dusky Singer, but the best
galloper he ever had was Had-i-wist for whom he
refused £6OOO from an Indian sportsman. Walker
was one of the best-informed pedigree men in the
State. Had-i-wist is now in work at a Common-
wealth stud depot.

“The Deacon” : The latest lucrative swindle
to come on the market can be carried in the breast
pocket. It is a little race game printed about post-
card size, and designed by a simple Chow, osten-
sibly for the amusement of small children. In three
parallel rows are three racehorses, with jockeys up,
at the barrier. Mother lights the flimsy paper when
the kids have picked their fancies. As the tiny
flame on the cigarette-like card advances the horses
race to the winning post, the first to arrive being
announced by a sharp “pop,” and the same with
second and third. I saw “Paddy the Trier” amusing
several of the “heads” with this parlor sport last week.
Betting began in bobs, and as always happens when
Paddy is at the helm, increased to dollars and
soon grew to quids. “Well, gents,” said Paddy,
“seeing I’m at the expense of the outfit I’m going
to be in on it.” The first time or two the usual
outsider pulled it off, and then the stakes were doubled.
Paddy picked the middle hotse, which duly won.
Another outsider rolled home, then Paddy won twice
in succession with doubled stakes. To show that all
was in order he now handed the next flimsy to the
rat-faced man who had been betting in fivers, and
stood out altogether. The other speculators con-
tinued to fare rottenly, and but one more card re-
mained. Paddy decided to come in again, with
wagering on the highest scale, picked a horse, and,
having won and collected, he brushed the ash from
his clothes and wandered off. Later I accidentally
met him and the rat-faced man celebrating. “It’s
quite simple,” he said. “You put a. tiny inlicating
number on the horse you want to back, and the
damped lines behind the others settle their chances.
Captain C. E. Hobson, who died the other
day, had three and a half yeans service
in the late war, and was badly wounded.
He had been a V.R.C. stip. for six years, up to the
time of his death. One of the best amateur riders
Just-deceased Captain C. E. HOBSON,
V.R.C. stipendiary steward.
in the State, he was Master of the Oaklands Hunt
Club for many years, and as straight and kindly as
he was game.
The “test trial” at Nottingham this week
will give the English selectors a wide range of
choice. In one or other of the team's are J. C.
Macßryan, who headed the Somerset averages last
year with 1507 runs averaging 37.67; Richard
Tyldesley (aged 26), who took 106 wickets at 15.40:
and the young left-hander A. P.. Chapman, who did so
well with Maelaren’s XI in Australia a couple of
years ago. Amcng the pros, are Jack Hobbs (41),
Pat Hendren (35), F. T. Woolley (37), C. H.
Parkin (37) and J. Hearne (33). The rivalry for
the captaincy is keen. F. T. Mann (Middlesex, and
a Cambridge “blue” in 1909-11) is an M.C.C.
favorite. But the two trial skippers are A. E. Gilli-
gan (Sussex and a Cambridge “blue” in 1919-20) and
A. W. Carr (Notts). Gilligan, who is 29, is a
great all-rounder, and last year scored 911, averaging
21.69, and took 139 wickets at 14.38; Mann, is 36,
and hit up 917 runs at 28.65 ; and Carr is 30, and
batted well with 1152 at 33.88.

A fast, open game and some good kicking
pleased the 35,000 zealots who pushed into Victoria
Park to watch the Carlton-Collingwood game on
Saturday. Play was even till the Magpies got into
their system; after that they steadily went ahead,
finishing with 131 points to Carlton’s 107. The
Blues’ centres and backs were weak, only O’Brien
holding his own. Horry Clover, for Carlton, and
Gordon Coventry booted 7 goals each. Though it
drew the smallest crowd, the closest game was on
the M. C. Ground, where the Fuchsias, flushed with
their victory over Carlton, tackled South and walloped
them after a hard struggle by 76 points to 69, in a
game that would have been improved by more atten-
tion to the ball and less to the man. St. Hilda’s
collision with Geelcng was also unmannerly, though
no open hostilities disturbed the proceedings. Saints
notched 102 points to Geelong’s 76. Essendon downed
Richmond by 94 points to 31. The Tigers’ com-
mittee has been scouring the Commonwealth for
star players, but the more it scours the less it seems
to score.
* * * *
In N.S.W. Rugby League premiership
round on Saturday, Balmain, the hitherto unbeaten,
crashed to Eastern Suburbs by 15 points (3 tries
3 goals) to 2 (one goal). The losers had a disastrous
accident toll. Dawson (a centre three-quarter from
the Union ranks) played a great game; his lone try
was the gem of the day. Arthur Oxford booted
three goals, making his aggregate 31 for the season.
He is the only decent goal-kicker in the League
this season. Uni. were downed by North Sydney
(16 to 13), North’s first win this season. St. George’s
walloping of Glebe (10 to 7) was also unexpected.
Carstairs’ try and two goals were chiefly to blame.
And Newtown upset Wests by 15 to 13. Balmain,
Easts, Souths and Glebe now own 6 points apiece,
while St. George and ’Varsity are each one behind
them.
N.S.W.’s League selectors have thrown most of
the old brigade over the fence in making up a
team to tackle Queensland next Saturday. The new
men have earned recognition, especially centre three-
quarter Dawson (Easts) and Jim Dunworth, the
husky ’Varsity forward. The revolution is understood
to be due to the League’s insistence on the selection
committee viewing all the big matches, and already
sportsmen are to be heard hoping that a similar
rule may be applied to cricket when summer comes
again.
“Half-forward”: They do a lot of their
back-chat in the advertisement columns of the press
on the other side of Bass Strait. Hence the follow-
ing -which appeared in Burnie (Tas.) Advocate
(23/5/’24) :
“Wanted. —Five elderly ladies to manage affairs
of the Yeoman Football Club. Previous experience
unnecessary.”
The explanation of the cryptic thing is that after a
searing defeat of the Yeoman F. C. by the Latro'oe
braves, the committee (all non-players) registered
their displeasure by sacking the club’s popular coach.
* * * *
The Canadian Soccer team drew again on
Saturday, this time with Newcastle. The Canucks are
handicapped by a heavy casualty-list. In the New-
castle match alone four players were outed, and
even at this early stage of their tour the visitors
are unable to field an XI of sound men. It seems
to suggest rottenness somewhere. Honestly played.
Soccer is the safest as well as the most artistic of
the football codes.
“Past Grammar”: The N.S.W. Rugby
Union has made yet another local alteration in the
rules which amounts to a reversal of one of the
fundamentals of the game. Hitherto, if a
tackled player was brought down and the ball touched
ground it was dead, till replayed. A player could
not score a try by lifting it across the line or by
sliding it over as he fell. The new rules allow a
player to pass the grounded ball and score a try
with it. This is supposed to “make the
game faster,” as if the ability and training
of the players were not the only possible
means to that end. This craze for producing a faster
game by cutting out allegedly hampering rules has
resulted in defensive methods being neglected, with
the lamentable results seen in the N.S.W. matches
in M.L. last season. The standard of N.S.W. Rugger
is high, considering the war-interval handicap and
the lack of inter-Stat» matches. But the growing
habit of playing the game here with fancy
rules for home consumption' only will prove a severe
hurdle when sides like M.L., Britain and South
Africa, all of which stick strictly to the code, are
encountered.
* * * #
“Machete”: Leaguers claim that Sullivan,
the ex-Welsh Union player, who is the star back of the
visiting English football team, possesses a world’s re-
cord by virtue of scoring 377 points—l 72 goals and
11 tries, last season. But that was in a club season
of, say, 35 to 40 matches. W. J. Wallace, the All-
Black, in international games, from 1903 to 1907
inclusive, scored 367 points, or 34 tries and 124
goals. On the All-Black tour of Great Britain alone,
he registered 22 tries and 77 goals in 33 matches —
a much more meritorious performance really than
that of our visitor.
* * * *
“Centurion”: The Yankee Rugger team,
recently beaten in London by the Blackheath Club,
staggered the know-alls by defeating France at Paris,
in the final of the qualifying round, by 17 to 3. The
Frenchmen were strong favorites, having defeated
Scotland handsomely. According to a cable the
Yanks played a very rough game, and the French
tacklers did not relish their work.
* * * *
The English Rugby Leaguers made hacks
of the Victorian XIII on the Fitzroy ground on
Saturday. The bulky British forwards (averaging
over 13-stone) fairly romped over their adversaries.
Sullivan kicked six goals, Parkin, the nippy captain
behind the scrum, got three tries, and half a dozen
others crossed the line. Vic. scored only 13 points
(3 tries 2 goals) to the visitors’ 45 points.
* * * *
“O. McKay M.” : Melbourne Uni.’s recent
intercollegiate sports provided the closest struggle
on record. With the long jump only to go, Queen's
and Ormond were level. It was a Newman repre-

considering the sodden ground. Ormcnl men scored

Y. R. Harbison again smashed Sydney
’Varsity high-jump figures at the inter-collegiate
championships last week. His 6ft. equalled the State
record by A. H. Scott (killed in action), and is
within 1 3-16 in. of the Australasian record. That
great all round athlete Gtto Nothling took the sprint
double (100yds. in 10 3-ssec., and 220yds. in 23
3-ssec.) ; L. Barr won the mile stylishly in 4min.
53 2-ssec.; and a stirring 880yds. ended in a dead-
heat between W. H. Coope and A. R. Callaghan in
2min. 11 l-ssec. Andrew’s beat the rest of the
Saints for the possession of the cup.

Albert Lloyd is back in Sydney and look-
ing for trouble. His immediate objective is Ern
Waddy whom he has already knocked out a couple
of times. But he can’t go on fighting' the South
Australian for ever (they have already had six
scraps) and outside Waddy there is practically no one
of any class here in the heavyweight division.
Lloyd beat most of the second-raters while abroad,
but made a poor showing against such veterans as
Bombardier Wells and Dick Smith.
Jock Niven (9st.) was too slow for
Digger Evans (9st. 21b.) at Sydney Stadium last
Saturday night. The little Scot had been doing so
well against all comers in Melbourne that his sup-
porters were clamoring for a match with feather-
weight-champion Billy Grime. Saturday’s exhibition
will cause that high ideal to be abandoned
HANNAH, the
Maoriland sculler,
who insists that
he is the Austral-
asian champion.
for a term. The Vic-
torian went after the
Digger at the gong,
and kept to him until
the final bell. But he
never fairly caught his
sprite-like adversary
until the 18th round,
when, in mid-ring, he
connected with a
heavily-laden left. Had
Niven possessed the
necessary experience,
he probably would have
outed the ex-A.I.F. man
there and then, but
Evans called up his
considerable reserves of
ringcraft, and, quickly
recovering, came back
to continue shooting in
his piston-rod rights.
He landed so often
with this aggravating
weapon that Niven's
carefully prepared
plans of attack were
ruined. At the finish,
Evans was so many
miles in front that the
decision in his favor
was accepted without
a hoot. A small crowd
provided a gate of
£270.
Wrestling sustained a severe set-back in
Melbourne on Saturday when about 9000 patrons ot
the sport were bored to expletives by the Clarence
Weber-Walter Miller affair. Weber was in no mood
to be entrapped by his clever little adversary, as
Meeske had been a month previously, and the match
was simply one referee hold after another. Miller
did a lot of illegal palming, also a certain amount of
kicking and butting, but the Australian’s exhibition
was not flawless either. Weber got the decision—
possibly because his protests were so persistent and
angry. A stirring featherweight boxing contest pre-
ceded the bout, in which Jim Newbury of Sydney
beat “Young” Conly of Melbourne in 10 rounds.
Both lads fought fast and exchanged a lot of
punishment.
“15-30’’: Europe is ablaze once more with
Davis Cup battles. Following Britain’s defeat of
Belgium, Switzerland has knocked out Austria, and
little Denmark has plunged Hungary into mourning.
Helvetia relied mainly on Aeschlimann to destroy
Austria (strongly represented by the Salm brothers),
and the mountaineer duly blotted out the opposition.
He wore the national edelweiss in the Davis Cup
last year, and has played much on European courts.
Hungary dug up a Baron von liehrling who took
both his singles matches by storm, but the Danes’
superiority in the doubles gave them the winning
trick. Britain’s next engagement is with Spain, and
the English T.A. has substituted the youthful Wheat-
ley for the veteran Kingscote. The absence of
Lycett seriously weakens the English side. Though
no longer a youth, he is an excellent doubles player,
and the results have shown up-to-date that the
better work in the full court decides the argument.
* * * *
“Cartot”: The chief reason for the lure
that two-up holds for many people is the. suddenness
with which comparative wealth may come to its
devotees. In that respect the game eclipses horse-
racing or gambling at cards. There are innumer-
able instances of men having entered a “school”
with a shilling or two and left w T ith hundreds of
pounds, all won by following heads or tails. Once
in North Queensland I obliged a deadbeat with a
“cuppler bob.” He was back in an hour with a florin
and an offer to lend me £lO, explaining that he
had “won 30 at the school.” In the same State a
man whose poverty had denied him breakfast and
lunch cleaned up a large school to the extent of
£6OO, having started with a shilling tossed to him
by a player at the ringside. He bought into a
hotel with the £6OO, and made a fortune. In-
stances such as these could be quoted by the dozen.
Which explains why the “mob” prefer “two-up” to any
other form .of gambling, and refuse to be deterred
by frequent fines or threats of gaol without the option.
■* * * *
“W.H.C.”: A member of our golf club
with a handicap of 24 conceived the notion that an
allowance of a yard at each hole instead of the
regulation number of strokes would enable him to
get even with the backmarkers. To test his scheme
a match was arranged between a very useful 10 man
and the 24 merchant, the pro. being referee. At
the turn the giver of yards was two down, but the
next six holes were long ones; the 10 man won them
all and the match by 4 and 3. The handicap is
equal to about 11 strokes on an average course.
The yard may be taken at any time during play, but
yards may not be accumulated. If left to the put-
ting green it gives the receiver a hole six feet in
diameter at which to putt—no mean advantage.
* * * *
“Rita”: In a transport of optimism Glen-
elg sought admission to S.A. League, and became its
eighth club. That was three years ago, and the
Tigers have now achieved the distinction of playing
43 games and losing the lot. However, defeat sits
lightly on the club’s supporters. Even the side’s
latent experience at the hands and feet of Sturt, who
kicked 25 goals 9 behinds to Glenelg’s 7 goals 12
behinds, hasn’t dispelled the hope, the dream, that
some, day Glenelg will win a match.
DEAD CERTS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Of all the racing cranks I’ve met I'll ’and the palm
to Brown —
There never was a greater crank in city or in town.
’E used to dream of ’orses and ’e’d talk of ’em in bed,
And knew each equine’s pedigree from A to bloomin’
Z.
A turf encyclopedia ’e was in very truth,
A fact which unkind friends declared a sign of mis-
spent youth.
But Brown ignored these rude remarks, and to them
paid no heed—
They’d all repent when he got rich per medium of
steed.
Brown w,as my next-door neighbor, and ’e’d let me in
the know
When this or that or something else was ’avin’ of
a go.
Each Saturday we’d venture forth, intent upon one
thing—
The “oil” we ’ad would surely help us break the
bloomin’ ring.
But some’ow when the day was o’er, and ’omeward
we would blow
We’d find that Moses Cohen ’ad relieved us of our
dough.
Still Brown, a super-optimist, would cheer me up a
treat:
“I know a cert, next Saturday, it can’t get blank
well beat.”
But now I’m giving up the game, and leaving it to
Brown;
The dead-sure things he slings ter me get beat or
tumble down.
The prads ’e says will walk in very often do (don’t
cheer),
They cannot raise a gallop, and they walk in at the
rear.
Brown still goes on dispensing “oil,” arid ’anding out
the certs,
On which ’e tells ’is cobbers they can put their crim-
son shirts.
“Dead certs.” is what ’e calls ’em, and no truer words
’e’s said—
All the flamin’ certs, ’e gave ter me were well and
truly dead.

“Daughters of the Seven Mile,” by Zora Cross,
has made a good start. The publishers announce
that the first edition of 4000 sold out in 48 hours.
Tom O’Callaghan, ex-chief Commissioner of Police
in Vic., who recently passed his 79th milestone, has
made a study of the history of Australian place-names,
and expects shortly to publish a book about it.
Nettie Palmer, M.A., a well-known Red Page con-
tributor, has won the £25 prize offered by the
Lothian Book Publishing Co. for the best critical
essay dealing with Australian literature since 1900.
Her essay entitled “Australian Literature in the
Twentieth Century” will be published in June.
M. L. Reading, for a dozen years past editor
of the Christchurch (M.L.) Times, who lately came
across to the sunshine, has gone north to sit in
the chair of Brisbane Telegraph. All Reading’s
predecessors for the past 40-odd years are alive- —
it probably couldn’t be said of any other considerable
paper in Australia.
“Veronal” ; Cayley’s long-projected “Birds of Aus-
tralia,” which was to have cost £lO,OOO, has been
abandoned, and instead “Bird Biographies,” with
life photographs and colored plates, is to appear.
The material collected for the other book will be
used. Perhaps there were too many competitors in
the more' or less limited field. Gregory Mathews
(in conjunction with Tom Iredale) got a “Manual
of the Birds of Australia” under way, and two out
of the projected four volumes have already been issued.
“J.H.” (London) : An Australian who is climbing
rapidly in Fleet-street is young Bertram Higgins,
of a well-known Melbourne family—his father has
brewery interests, and a sister is Mrs. Ted Holling-
dale, of Sydney. Bertram is one of the highbrow
circle that revolves around Yeats, Lennox Robinson,
Robert L}'nd, J. O. Squire, and other literary stars.
He writes regularly for the Times Literary Supple-
ment, the Daily News, Mercury and other dailies
and periodicals. His book reviews are among the
best things of their kind in London, and his verse
finds ready acceptance in most of the principal
weeklies.
“Fax”: Melbourne theatres lately missed an old
first-night identity in Harry Short, who edited the
Leader for 36 years and had completed a half-
century of journalism ere he cried “Enough!” He
retired from the Leader chair about the middle of
March. Short was quite new to editorship when
The Bulletin spoke of him, in an illustrated article,
as “rather an Adonis, as journalists go.” Except
that his hair has whitened, his appearance has
changed very little in the process of the seasons.
He has been for so long a d.c. habitue on big
nights that a lot of people who knew him only by
sight will be glad to hear that it is not through
illness he is missing from his old haunts.
“L’Fou”; All political parties have noble aims
and seek only their country’s good. They say so
themselves. For instance, the Vic. Farmers’ Union
only takes up the poor farmers’ case because it
wants justice for all. Its official organ, the Farmers’
Advocate, mourns constantly the way farmers are
robbed of the reward of their labor. It clamors
for Government backing and help in opening new
markets and monopolising home ones. Side by
side with these impassioned appeals appear, w T eek
after week, an imported serial, lifted and unacknow-
ledged jokes, articles and verse, and a philosophic
feature, called “The Preeny Family” in the U.S.A.
but rebranded “The Mallee Family” in the Farmers’
Advocate. What Hayseed would say to similar
smue-glcd importations of spuds and butter can
be imagined.
The Argus continues to be a training-school
for other journals. Lloyd Dumas, chief of
staff, is the last to leave; he takes over
the editorship of the Sun Pictorial. He said
good-bye to the Argus once before, but that
time it was. to go with then Priminister Hughes to
England. Of course he found Billy impossible, and
returned to the Collins-street thunder-shop. There
luck bit his heels, as Charlie Smith was made
assistant manager and Letcher left to become indus-
trial adviser to the Chamber of Manufactures.
Charles Taylor, whose place Dumas takes, is now
editor of the evening Sun, with Monty Grover as
editor-in-chief. Taylor was associated with Grover
in the fight to establish the Sydney Sun, and they
count it good that after a strenuous year their
’evening bantling in Melbourne has achieved half the
circulation of the ancient Herald.
THE OLD HARD-HITTER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“In the quoin-drawer of the Wellington (M.L.)
Evening Post job-printing department there frater-
nises with the quoins, shooting-sticks and planers a
scraggy, hard-faced, battered-up old knock-about
mallet, which has been in use for about a quarter of
a century.”
The Mallet —
I am tired and I am weary,
And, although I’m keeping cheery,
I feel the final blow is coming fast;
I have lost my square-cut figure,
And my one-time youth and vigor; •
I am heading for the dead things of the past.
Chorus of Quoins —
He has hammered us and battered us,
Rammed us home and scattered us,
Oh, he swings ’em very heavy in a rage.
Though his head is cracked and crinkled,
And with years his face is wrinkled,
He’s a damned hard-hitter for his age.
The Mallet —
In the early days of working
No-one ever found me shirking
(You will pardon me for overhauling Fame) ;
First selected for my beauty
And retained for sterling duty,
Ever eager for the honor of my name.
Planer Solo —
We have thumped for years together,
We have battled hell-for-leather—
No, he ain’t the kind old soul that he appeal's,
And, although I’m not complaining
Of the way he does his planing,
He’s a damned vicious puncher for his years.
The Mallet —
But although decay has started,
For the sake of days departed
The “hands” delight toiswing me as of yore,
And once we buckle to it-
Well, the quoins have cause to rue it,
And we clinch ’em as we clinched ’em long before.
Shooter Solo —
Cheer, oh cheer, I am the shooter!
Bring the horn on deck and toot her!
I’m related to the mallet, I’m his mate,
And there’s not a shooter livin’
That could stand what I’ve been given—
Yes, he hits damned heavy for his weight.
Grand finale —
He’s the King of all the Hammers
And the star of wooden slammers;
He has made his brand of mallet aH the rage.
Though his body’s thin and meagre,
Still his heart is just as eager—
He’s a damned old marvel for his age.

“There certainly appears to be good money to be made by financing the purchase of motor-cars

present activity in the motor-car trade offers good opportunity for such a company as this.
This is not a prospectus within the meaning of the Companies Act 1915, and contains nothing

Extract from critique by “F.1.C.A.,”
“Evening Sun,” May 13
The growth of motor traffic in Australia in
recent years has been very marked, and
so far most of the financing of purchasers
for terms has been done by the agents for
the various cars on the market. The
promoter considers that there is a good
opening for a company to specialise in this
direction, and in support of its estimate
it quotes the results of the trading of
similar ventures in the United States of
America.
Last Month 2638 New Cars
were Registered
with the Registration Department. This
exceeds 31,000 motor vehicles per annum.
If this Company financed only 5 per cent,
of this number, and to the extent of only
£lOO each, the total required for Victoria
alone would exceed £150,000.

In “The Tales of Hoffmann,” at Mel-
bourne Majesty’s last week, the work of Toti
Dal Monte was especially delightful. Her
buxom brightness was perfectly automatised,
for the part of the Doll. Her little patter-
ing feet, scarcely discernible under the wide-
tucked skirt, seemed actually to be driven
by machinery. And the voice, rising in a
joyous prattle of crystal tones to rest for a
moment on a high note of ravishing caress,
performed a feat of melody that one will
cherish for many a day. Aga Lahoska had
her chance as the beguiling Giuletta in the
Second Tale. The scene offers no oppor-
tunities for melodrama on the Carmen scale
of grandeur, and the Polish songstress was
therefore reduced to looking her best against
ii: background of luminous midnight and
Grand Canal. For the third scene Lina
Scavizzi was a white wraith of a heroine, in
Pi flaxen wig, who put despair into her pas-
sion and often varied her somewhat lusty
warbling with striking mezzo, voce effects.
Dino Borgioli adequately realised a Hoff-
mann who was ever pursuing and ever eluded.
Rightfully serious as the raconteur of his
blisses and misses in the prologue, he was
poetically refined and wistful in the follow-
ing chapters of his story. His singing also was
Sweet and true. He was never off the note.
Alfred Maguenat was offered a good range
ot characters in Coppelius, Dappertutto and
Dr. Mirakel, and he gave them all their
sinister authority, his Dappertutto creating
an almost new tradition for light, debonair
villainy. Vera Bedford served Borgioli as
a slender and tuneful Nicklaus. and Luigi
Parodi was a round Spalanzani, bloated with
pride over the achievements of his Olympia.
Luigi Cilia contributed another set of little
etchings as Cochenille, Pitichinaccio and the
servant Franz, and Vida Sutton was the
voice that breathed o’er the palazzo when the
lustrous Lahoska held the stage. The rollick-
ing glees of the drinkers in the tavern were
fine, and Schiavoni’s handling of the orches-
tra deserved an extra round of cheers.
parallel tragedies of “Cavalleria” and
I Pagliacci were driven home by two capi-
tal casts, in which Lina Scavizzi and Apollo
Granforte took the honors. Granforte, as
Tonio, scored a triumph, not so much for his
singing of the Prologue, though it roused the
house to a tumult, as for his extraordinary
ability on the histrionic side. From the
Girt he broke away from all conventions.
GRAND OPERA SEASON.
“ OTELLO,” AT MELBOURNE HIS
MAJESTY’S.
Nellie Melba as Desdemona, and Antonio
Marques as Otello, at the place where
the jealous music begins.
The gestures, the vacuous smiles and giggles,
the malignancy that dawned on the half-
imbecile countenance after Nedda had
spurned his advances with a whip, were
never within the compass of any previous
Tonio in this writer’s memory. The study
was expert. The reality was harrowing.
One tried to forget it and spare attention for
Nedda, sweetly rendered by Aurora Rettore,
and Canio, whose heartbreak was put into
Latin emotion by Antonio Marques; but
Granforte simply dominated the show and
threw it off its artistic balance. The fat
was more evenly distributed in “Cavalleria,”
for here Piccaluga, as Turridu, was forceful
enough to challenge Scavizzi’s supremacy.
Judged on the whole performance, however,
bcavizzi was the more haunting figure. Her
sorrow was not particularly weepy or volu-
minous, but it carried a conviction of its
fervor by its depth. Its full tenor was dis-
closed in a hard little sob : its hopelessness
by the eloquent hands and eyes. Both she
and Piccaluga sang the melodramatic music
with discretion, Piccaluga commencing
brightly with the “Siciliana,” warbled to a
creaky piano behind the curtain. Grandini
needed a bit more stature to make Alfio’s
contempt for his rival really scathing. Doris
Mclnnes seemed rather overcome by the re-
sponsibilities of Lola; and, though Vida Sut-
ton treated her helping of the score with
respect, she was skimpy in the matter of
maternal feeling, not to say physically un-
suitable for the job.

The popular double will be repeated to-
morrow night. “The Tales of Hoffmann” is
down again for Saturday afternoon, and
Carmen is to follow at night.
At Melbourne Palace the scene has changed
to Cape Cod, U.S.A., where Allen Doone and
a full /company are digging for a box which
contains nothing but an eccentric old gentle-
man’s advice to a somewhat languid descend-
aat - piece - is called “ Jim O’Brien,
Pirate, but the piracy is invisible; in fact,
the spirit of the play is the same that
settles down on a respectable suburban
family after a heavy Sunday tea. Doone is
unimpressive as a woebegone author who
achieves an eleventh-hour success; Edna
lveeley, as the daughter of an old bibliophile,
is never dull, but is never saucy enough to
be a minx; and among the rest of the team
Eardley Turner appears unexpectedly as the
bookish ancient aforesaid, presenting, as usual,
a deft picture of character which shines like
a good deed in a two-up school. Next Satur-

It is again “Kissing Time” at Melbourne
Loyal, and all the principals are flirtish by
turns, pairing off as the mood of the libret-
tist takes them, and creating an atmosphere
of gentle giddiness. Madge Elliott and Nell
iayne are the two sprites who keep the
eyes of their adorers dancing, Madge being
a damsel of strictly decorous ways who
somehow manages to make Cyril Ritchard’s
face read like a treatise on jealousy. Cecil
Kelleway, m the spacious red pants of a
f/ench colonel, is beset by an air of gallantry
that may have meant a lot originally, but
never gets a fair trial in the present setting,

Minns has a Melbourne show:—
Those in search of fine weather in Melbourne will
see some charming bits framed by B. E. Minns at
tlie Fine Art Society’s rooms. His largest example,
Queen of the Ridge,” is a fine picture of a great
/ Australian day which is given unnecessary human
interest by a group of abos. in the foreground.
Studies of Sydney Harbor and the Myall River ar-
handled with skill, the artist showing considerable
adroitness in deepening effects with body-color. His
method is probably seen at its best in the impres-
sion of storm clouds, Pymble, which dramatically
pictures the uncertainty and hush preceding an
atmospheric disturbance. His ability as a portraitist
of colored races is obvious in his pictures of a
Durban rickshaw boy and a Zulu woman, both of
which have an engaging reality. His drawings in
pencil and chalk are likewise commendable for
delicate subtleties of tone; but one has to look
closely to appreciate them. “She Oaks, Crawford
River” (No. 24), is a little gem. Three etchings are
not first-class. A certain flatness suggests that Minns
is not happy with the needle.

. fMhc Time,” at Sydney Majesty’s,
there is a feast of music for those who dote
on Schubert, a strongly-running current of
!ove for those that way inclined and a touch
ot pathos for those who like to drop a fur-
tive tear. As the programme says, it is “a
• i'YY lt:i mu ? lc > Franz Schubert.” There
« i n 5, om f, dy and no tragedy-just music;
Schubert s throughout, from solos to sex-
tettes. Perhaps Grandma will like it better
than the younger generation; it will cer-
tainly appeal more to the music-lover than to
the playgoer with a spoiled palate. Schubert
himself is somewhat caricatured by John Ral-
ston as a tubby, bespectacled, middle-aged
musician, whose love for Lili, the daughter
of the Court glass-maker, and his hesitation
in letting her know about it —apparently the
girls of 1826 liked to be told just as much
as those of to-day—is responsible for the
usual misunderstanding, brought about quite
innocently by Marini, an operatic star. But
just as the breakers are within a stone’s
throw and the handkerchiefs are quite moist,
that skilful theatrical pilot, Cupid, ports his
helm, and there is more music, the flapper
weeps afresh—this time out of sheer joy—
and all is right as right can be. Even with-
out missing the opportunities for introducing
Schubert’s music, the show could have been
made a lot brighter; in fact, the music de-
serves it. But that is no fault of the cast—
it makes the most of what few opportunities
for acting it has. When there are no less
than 17 musical items in a show, dialogue
and most other things have to take a back
seat.
* * * *
The cast, especially on the male side, has
been very well chosen; and the quartettes,
quintettes and sextettes are particularly
good. John Ralston (with Seven or eight
numbers, plus encores) is the shining light,
with Claude Flemming (also seven items)
a good second, in spite of one or two bad
blemishes. Eve Lynn, a new arrival, as Lili,
has not the same opportunities; but she has
a voice that will make her popular. Arthur
Stigant, as the glass-maker, gets more varied
chances than most—for one thing, lie spends
less of his time singing—and with Blake
Adams, a comic detective, and Byrl Wake-
ley, as Marini, neither of whom appear on
the musical programme, puts some sparkle
into a show that will be champagne to quite
a lot, but flat beer to others.
“The Man in Dress Clothes,” with Sey-
mour Ilicks beneath the broadcloth, opened
at Sydney Opera House on Saturday with
much flourish of publicity trumpets, the
large noise being based partly on the place
the actor-cmm-playwright fills in the English
stage-world and partly on the London suc-
cess of the piece. Yet the play, like so
many of these adaptations from the French,
is cheap and frothy stuff: it deals with the
adventures of a French nobleman who, after

endowing his wife with great possessions, be-
comes temporarily estranged from her, has
most of his remaining effects seized for debt,
and is henceforth occupied in alternately
buffooning his way through impecuniosity
and making himself tense and emotional in
the scenes that lead up to the inevitable
reconciliation. There is a long cast of
characters, mostly subordinate; a Paris flat
and a glittering cafe provide the settings.
* * * *
Mr. Hicks has a remarkably fine stage
presence and some indisputable gifts; he
relies for his appeal on a certain buffeting
intensity that is in flat contrast to the quiet,
easy, apparently effortless effects of a Bouci-
cault or a Grossmith. He is a rapid, some-
times almost a torrential speaker, and in the
first act especially he loses something in
distinctness through this exuberance—though
it may be that the acoustic properties of
the spacious Opera House should bear some
of. the blame. Both he and Miss Terriss re-
ceived a flattering reception; the latter, as
the Countess D’Artois, plays with spirit and
vivacity in the lighter scenes, with womanly
feeling m the third act, with charm in both.
Frederick Lloyd, as the Count’s friend Henri
de la Tour, the vacuous and amusing man
about town, is excellent. Miss Mione Stewart,
as Foxtrot (a Bird of Passage), is vivacity
and candor incarnate; she earns and gets a
bushel of applause after her final scene with
the Countess. Others deserving of a word
are Miss Emma Temple, as the Count’s faith-
ful old concierge, and Miss Joan Kingdon,
as Celeste.
“Madame X,” at Sydney Royal, is again
showing Muriel Starr in the morbid role of
the hopeless drug-soaked woman, the pro-
duct of a husband’s unforgiving hardness and
20 years of devotion to the absinthe bottle.
The story is powerfully unpleasant, but it
gives the actress more scope for her talent

spines than the weedy “Garden of Allah.”
Frank Harvey is apparently just as much
at home in the role of the flashy, swashbuck-
ling adventurer Laroque as in that of a
Trappist monk; versatility is not the least
remarkable of this very capable actor’s gifts.
The minor parts are, on the whole, well
filled. Gerald K. Souper, as Louis Floriot,
the unbearable apostle of ultra-respectability,
is an interesting study in self-repression.
Reginald Long, as Raymond Floriot, is a
trifle over-impassioned in the last act, but
he is more successful in keeping the court
scene above bathos than the average advo-
cate might be. Jack Cannot, as the black-
mailer Perissard, and John Fernside, as his
partner in “confidential missions,” add their
bit to the success of the play as the pur-
veyors of quaint appearances and ludicrous
mannerisms. Among the minor roles, Leslie
Victor (Dr. Chesnel), Ailsa Grahame
(Marie, the pretty chambermaid) and Rosa-
mond McMillan (as Raymond’s sweet-
heart) are the most notable.

“Variety” is having a spin at the new
Sydney Palace, the same being the old Palace
renewed. “Town Topics” is the name given
to the show, which is a re-hash of songs popu-
lar for the last year or more, and gags that
are moth-eaten here and there. Yet the
show is bright, and goes with a swing—and
that’s all to the credit of the young men and
women who make the songs and turns as
good as new. From his first flittersome entry
on Saturday night, Billy Maloney had the
big house grinning, and presently had it also
singing the fruity refrain to “Fill ’Em Up.”
Elton Black’s braw Scots lad has a Lauder-
like flavor, and his voice is of much the same
quality. Arthur Aldridge overcame the
hurdle of a bad cold and uncorked a good
brand of tenor. Alice Benetto was very
feminine and dainty in her soprano num-
bers ; the heavyweight champion on the bill
was the evergreen sextette from “Lucia”; and
Walter Vernon’s ventriloquist act was an-
other applause-bringer in the quick-step show.

A one-man Sydney show: —
Eric Langker, who has spread 69 oils upon the
walls of Horderns’ Gallery, should have cut the
number down by a third. He is an industrious
young brushinan, but his inspiration finds it hard to
keep pace. When he .realises this he should do
some fine work, for at his best he is full of
promise—he is already equipped with a fairly sound
draughtsmanship, a good sense of color and a healthily
energetic method of applying paint. His main weak-
ness is composition. This is badly evident in his
big picture, “An Australian Landscape,” with its
central gutter and background hills forming an
irritating T, and in a couple of smaller canvases
wherein he rings the changes with a stiffly-placed
haystack and shed. And he insistently distracts
attention by a blob of cloud like a bursting bomb
set mathematically in the middle of his skies. His
best results are achieved in things like “River
Reflections,” “Haymakers” and one or two of his
harbor views; and a couple of tree studies are set
in well-suggested atmosphere, though often he is not
happy with foliage. Some of his still-lifes show
a fine confidence in the treatment of flowers —and
an even greater confidence in the prices.

The other film is lifted from a novel of Lon-
don sassiety, by I. A. R. Wylie. The news
gazette is limited to pictures gleaned from
spots that are marked red in atlases, and the
musical items are free from the taint of
tincan-alleyism. “Rosita,” at the Crystal
Palace, is vivid and interesting; but it is un-
fortunate for Mary Pickford, in the title-
role, that she is seven weeks behind Pola
Negri, who covered the same ground in “The
Spanish Dancer.” Spain is also the scene
of “A Wife’s Romance,” at the Strand, and
“Australia’s Lonely Lands,” as depicted by
Francis Birtles, is the better of the two at

cranks that valuable information on the form
of certain ponies is to be given; but it is

sponsible for the title. At the Lyric Tom

There have been more good concerts in
Adelaide, notably by the Orpheus Society,
with J. M. Dunn conducting, and by ClitE
Lathlean, an Adelaide product, who is
rapidly growing famous elsewhere. Perry’s
circus is on the old Frome-road site, and the
Majestic has a variety bill strong on the
musical side, notably with Coscia and Coelho.
Royal and Prince of Wales are both about
to get busy with musical comedy. At West’s
is Tauehert, the Bloke, passing improbably
as an English earl, with eyeglass complete;
it is an absurd story, but the setting makes
it tolerable. Betty Balfour, the English star,
is on the screen at the York, and holds her
own with Enid Bennett on the same pro-
gramme ; also at Wondergraph Laurette
Taylor shows her idea—which was the origi-
nal idea—of how “Peg o’ My Heart” should
be played.
From an Adelaide critic:—
Mrs. Gwen Barringer, who has had a show at the
Society of Arts Hall, seems to be switching off from
the gum-tree studies of Heysen to something resem-
bling the ideals of Will Ashton; like him, she now
loves boats lying against a wharf. Her water-colors
come mainly from Tasmania. Hobart and Mt. Wel-
lington are seen from all sorts of angles, and the
old buildings on the quay take on a new aspect
when viewed through the bare rigging of ships.
The coloring is delightful. From nearer home come
studies of massed almond blossom, of well-kept
gardens, and of the familiar eucalypt. Professor
Archibald Strong opened the show with brief re-
marks on the association between painting and
literature. About half of the 55 pictures were
bought on the spot.
“T.P.” : As a knickerbocker nipper I saw
Ristori play Queen Elizabeth in Melbourne
Town Hall. It must have been a great per-
formance, for even to-day I can get a thrill
along my backbone by conjuring up the
great actress struggling from her bed on the
floor of the stage to once more place the
crown on her head, as the Italian equivalent
of “The King is dead ! Long live the King!”
was shouted from the wings. I have been
hunting through old files to find the date, but
in vain. Years later Ristori’s niece, Signora
Majeroni, came on the scene with her bril-
liant husband, and after 12 months’ study of
English played Fedora, Marie Antoinette and
the like. The couple had, despite their
genius, a hard spin, as they had neither
the cash nor the backing to pay decent re-
muneration for adequate support.

“Pollio” on film censorship :
Without impugning any of the arguments against
“Freetrade in Filth” (B. i5/5/’24), it is but lair to
the imported films to mention that they are, on
the whole, innocuous so far as the photographic
matter is concerned —the censors have seen to that.
“Flaming Youth,” as a matter of fact, was devitalised
before a single camera was used on it. The Metho-
dist Conference could sit it out without turning a
hair —but for the sub-titles and the pre-created
atmosphere. What really need censoring nowadays
are the preliminary advts. and the posters. The
advts. quoted—“ Screen Sensation,” “Naughty Midnight
Bathing Party,” and “Amazing Daring”—are intended
to make people think that the picture is as dirty
as the book. Of course it isn’t; but if that impres-
sion wasn’t given no one would waste twopence
on the film. “Flapper Wives” is another of the same
sort, only sillier. There isn’t a flapper wife in it,
and the whole story concerns a very dull parson’s
yawnful worries with his much duller churchwardens,
one of whom is married to a lady of middle age and
mediocre charms. No censor worth his salt would cut
an inch of any film’s photography nowadays; but he
might profitably extirpate most of the sub-titles and
prohibit nearly all the outside advertising.
From Lucy Firth, lion. sec. of the Good
Film League of N. S. Wales:—
The Bulletin’s reference to the advts. for the
films “Flaming Youth” and “Flapper Wives” should
draw public attention to the need for more adequate
censorship of the advts. for all moving pictures. It
is well known that films are rarely as lurid as their
advertisements suggest; there is far less adequate
censorship of advertising matter concerning pictures
than of the pictures themselves. The Good Film
League of N.S.W. is working for the general improve-
ment of pictures, for the provision of suitable pro-
grammes for children, and for the adequate censor-
ship of picture-show advertisements.
Mrs. Francis Anderson is the president of
the League; and Miss Firth (Croydon) and
Miss Charles (Clarence House, Glebe) are
the hon. secs.
PICTORIAL INDIGESTION.
“One can only paint what is in oneself, you

“Lond”: Seymour Hicks ran eighth in the
London Bystander’s competition for naming
the most popular 10 men on the stage to-day.
The prize was £5O0 —£250 for the most suc-
cessful placer—and a quarter of a million
votes came in. All of the first nine got
into five figures. Du Maurier took the lead
(and a cabinet of 1000 cigars) from Owen
Nares. The others placed in the first 10
were Matheson Lang, George Robey, Henry
Ainley, Leslie Henson, Sir John Martin
Harvey, Seymour Hicks, George Grossmith
and W. 11. Berry. The promoters remark
with surprise that the voting enormously
eclipsed that in a similar competition con-
cerning actresses. It seems that the vast
majority of women would not take the
trouble to vote over their own sex.
From Mrs. E. G. Allen, of Randwick: —
As the widow of the Lite W. H. Leake, I must tell
“T.P.” (B. 22/5/’24) that he is quite mistaken. True,
my late husband played the Tramp in one of Bland
Holt’s shows, and got special notices for his artistic
sketch. But there was nothing wrong with his
throat —there never was. And he was never “down
and out.” He was, at the time mentioned, a member
of Bland Holt's co., on a contract —a lengthy one —
and received his salary as a member of the co. I
may add that he never had a penny in his life that
he had not worked for; and till he died, a few
years after Holt’s show, he earned a good living.
“F.L.H.”: With the demolishing of the
motor garage, late Gartofi’s livery stables, in
Lonsdale-street, goes one of Melbourne’s old
playhouses. After a beginning as Tatter-
sail’s horse bazaar and Victoria Market, it
became in 1858 Rowe’s American Circus,
one De Vere, a slack-rope performer, being
a prominent figure. Here, also, “Madame
Douglas” did the uninteresting feat of walk-
PRAYER BEFORE ACTION.
“Well, Madame, if you won’t remove your hat, might
beg you to ash your escort to remove his
coat?”
ing a thousand miles in as many hours. A
couple of years later the house became the
Prince of Wales’s Theatre; and McKean
Buchanan, the tall American tragedian,
played “Macbeth” there. R. G. Marsh re-
christened the house the Lyceum in 1862.
An old bill of his mentions: “Children in
arms and dogs, one guinea each.” The name
of Louise Arnot looms large in the Marsh
productions. She was the original Cassy
in Melbourne productions of “Uncle Tom’s
Cabin,” Marsh being the cullud hero, Louis
Aldrich was Simon Degree, and Marsh junior
Topsy. Louise also tackled male characters
like Claude Melnotte in “The Lady of Lyons”
and Richard III.; in the latter case Aldrich
was Richmond.
“A.P.” : The present opera season in Mel-
bourne has led to some strenuous and bitter
complaints about unfair booking arrange-
ments. They come from unfortunates who
rise up early in the morning and contem-
plate Allan and Co.’s windows and then fail
to secure a coupon that enables them to pur-
chase seats. Allan and Co., J. and N. Tait
and Tallis (on behalf of J.C.W.) take it in
turns to reply and to indicate how heart-
broken they are that all the people who
want to go to the opera can’t get in. Yet
the plan of allowing as many as eight seats
to be booked on a coupon inevitably serves
as an incentive for speculators to sleep all
night outside Allan’s front door and sell their
coupons to latecomers.
“Santander”: Strange that while Leon-
cavallo’s “I Pagliacci” is in the repertoire
of almost every opera co., his by no means
unworthy version of “La Boheme” is hardly
known outside Italy. The piece has been
outed by its inability to stand comparison
with Puccini’s more melodious setting of the
tragedy; but there are many little opera-
houses in Italy where the lesser work gets a
hearing. To my way of thinking, Leon-
cavallo has always been handicapped by un-
distinguished libretti. The story that we
now all try to forget whilst listening to the
music of “I Pagliacci” he used to proudly
claim as his own. though he was really in-
debted to a little playlet, “The Wife of
Tabarin,” written by Catulle Mendes, in
Paris. Catulle had a gay way with the
French language; Leoncavallo merely took
the bones of the plot and clad them in cheap
Italian finery, so to speak, with the result
that he was accused of imitating Mascagni.
“H.E.S.”: There is more delusion than
illusion'about present grand-opera perform-
ances. Audiences throw emotional fioubie-
somersaults over portly and middle-agen
prima donnas impersonating fragile young
things of 17 or thereabouts ; and the same
unreasoning ecstasies greet any slow-footed
gentleman of generous avoirdupois who, with
one eye riveted on the prompter, pours out
his agonised soul in a mild tremolo tnat in-
variably takes the count in every round with
a heavyweight orchestra.
A new record for the music-hall has been
established by Carl Hertz, the illusionist
who died at Coventry (Ens\) in March last
—he left a quarter of a million.
“Caesar’s Ghost”: Algy was a stage-struck
youth who hung round the theatre until the
assistant s.-m. put him on as a super at half
a crown a night. Being enthusiastic and
presentable he was promoted to a three-line
part, and the experiment might have suc-
ceeded if a jesting old reprobate hadn’t fired
his ambition by relating apocryphal stories
of thespian beginners who had made sudden
rises on the boards by helping stars out of
difficulties. The most circumstantial lie re-
lated to Wilson Barrett, who, having been
assisted by a mythical super, when he had
forgotten his lines, was alleged to have re-
warded the imaginary young man with
parts which soon led to an
established position on the Lon-
don stage. It was Algy’s func-
tion in the play to carry a mes-
sage to the star. The latter, a
grumpy person, had to put in
long cogitating pauses, which,
of course, he had cut at rehear-
sals. Scenting his opportunity,
Algy began helping him out.
Encouraged by facial contor-
tions which he mistook for
signs of gratitude, the infatu-
ated youth proceeded with his
prompting even when the star
roared out his lines to drown
the interruptions. The audi-
ence sized up the situation and
commenced to laugh. “Get off.
you fool!” the star hissed ; and,
realising at length that he had
made a mess of the scene, Algy
bolted. When the star, with
rage in his eyes, came off also.
Algernon lost his head com-
pletely and fled frantically
across the stage. In his haste
he collided with the scenery,
which depicted a Fair English
Countryside, wrecking the
Rustic Bridge and flattening
out the Old Mill. He got away
somehow, and never came back
for his 7s. 6d.
“Ca>sar's Ghost”: Three Australian girls
who have gone a long way on the stage got
their big opportunity on the same night. The
just-married Gladys Moncrieff, who was a
pupil of Mrs. Hugh Ward and was under-
studying at Her Majesty’s, had to step into
the shoes of Josephine, in “H.M.S. Pina-
fore” ; at the Criteiuon Enid Bennett had
to take the place of her principal, Josephine
Cohan, who was ill; and Dot Brunton had
to do exactly the same thing at the Royal.
Fortune was running about with gifts that
night. Enid Bennett stepped into her prin-
cipal’s shoes in a double sense —Josephine
Cohan was the first Mrs. Fred Niblo, and
Enid Bennett is the second.

months. But Du Maurier is not the only
London manager who, after a long run of
success, has suddenly backed a loser. Basil
Dean, whose luck with repertory lias been
uncanny since he took over St. Martin’s and
made a commercial success of Galsworthy
and Clemenee Dane, just as unexpectedly
misjudged the fidelity of his patrons; thin
houses have been the consistent fate of The
Forest,” “Conchita” ran for less than a
week, and even “Good Luck” has failed to
draw at Drury-lane.
“Pedro”: The elder Boucicault appears to
have admitted that he got the plot of “Lon-
don Assurance” from John Brougham, as
“0.K.” (B. 22/5/’24) wrote. Actually the
whole play was claimed by another person,
who plausibly said that it was quite unlike
all Boucicault’s other work in both style and
story. At least Brougham was satisfied,
which is more than Oscar Wilde was in
somewhat similar circumstances. _ At his
earnest solicitation Frank Harris bought
from him the scenario of a comedy, and in
due course wrote the play, which had some
success. Wilde, then in squalid exile on
the Continent, was furious about it. “I
have sold that scenario to several of my
friends,” he wrote to Harris in effect, “and
none of them ever used it. You have de-
stroyed an asset on which I could always
raise fifty pounds.”
ONION IS STRENGTH.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The members of the Grand Opera Company swear
by onions for giving a clear and resonant voice.”
If you would have a bell-like voice,
A sweetly clear and vibrant one,
The vegetable of your choice
Should always be the on-i-on.
I-tal-i-an ’twere well you banish,
And for the future sing in Spanish.
The homely bulb when eaten raw
Has magic gifts that never fail;
A couple lying in the craw
Will make of you a nightingale;
And ears galore you’ll charm, be sure,
Whatever noses may endure.
VICTORIA.

according to experienced Farmers, a team of 12 Horses will
cost in Feed alone for 12 months • • • • •
To maintain ONE CASE Tractor in Fuel and Oil during the
same period, and give results such as appear in the following
table, cost a South Australian Farmer in 1923 . •
A saving by comparison of • • • • • •
Total Cost of Fuel and Oil, £137 10s. No repairs were required.
The figures shown in the above table convey their own significance to any experi-
enced farmer. Yet this is not all. Look at the economy in labour costs. A
CASE 15/27 Tractor will do the work of two 8-horse teams, yet it can be
operated by ONE man, and all the work associated with horse teams eliminated.
Moreover, horses must be fed whether they work or not. With the CASE
Tractor —no work, no fuel.
Then, again, see the reserve of power you have always at command, and the
advantage of being able to use that power just when, how, and where it is needed.
Not so with horse teams—they must be rested after heavy work, perhaps when
conditions make it almost imperative to follow on with the job.
The CASE can be worked day or night—in hot
or cold weather, in very heavy soil, wet or dry,
on heavy grades and stiff rises. It offers numer-
ous advantages over other tractors of similar
power —it is specially adaptable for ploughing,
discing, harrowing, seeding, etc.; it delivers
maximum pull at the drawbar, and, as shown
above, is ve.iy light on oil and fuel.
For easy manipulation and general usefulness on
the farm, it excels in all classes of work.
Investigate the CASE Tractor proposition. It
is power you need to ensure better results,
bigger crops, and larger profits.

Arc Welders Are Savers
ELECTRICITY, bestowing its countless benefits on humanity,
has ever found Westinghouse its most faithful servant.
There is one more convenience added for the benefit of commerce.
Many broken parts of machines that were formerly thrown away
are now mended by Westinghouse Arc ’Welders. This saves time,
labour and money. Many a broken vital part in a machine that
would have occasioned a tremendous loss, waiting for its duplicate
to be made, is now mended and remade as good as new by Westing-
house Portable Arc Welders. Here again another great saving of
time and substance can be credited to the great force Electricity.

on a vacation during May, June, July, August or Septem-
ber, you can escape the cold months at home and enjoy a
memorable holiday.

northern tropics. The time named will give 3or 4 weeks

fare from Sydney and return; hotel accommodations,
inter-island cruises, sight-seeing trips, recreational features
and all necessary incidental expense. It permits a visit
to Kilauea, the living volcano, in Hawaii National Park.
When buying passage to Europe or America arrange
with ticket agent for a stopover of one or two weeks in
Hawaii—it will not increase transportation costs.
In such a holiday you will find complete rest and relaxation;
warm sunshine; a new and enchanting environment; brilliant
flowers, exotic fruits: fascinating Hawaiian moonlight and
music; surf riding and swimming at Waikiki; golf over perfect
courses; tennis, deep sea fishing, mountain climbing, all out-
door sports

Bertram I.: But why make all that fuss
just because an English paper said such things?
You wouldn’t notice it if an Australian paper said
them. Yet the chances are that the Australian paper
would know ten times more about the subject....
Moramma: Can’t print it. We should hate to
spend winter in gaol M.P.C.: Much obliged....
Clair D.; Not well enough tailored... .Te P.: Not
enough in sunset verses.... Ciesar: It only says the
old things in pretty lumpy fashion.... J.M.S.Y.: The
sonnet is p00r.... Chant Pagan: You make nothing
of it.... Essjay: A good way off.... Vera C.: That’s
about the tenth call of the bush or lure of the
bush to-day; and we haven’t heard the bush say
one real word in any of them. E.W.L.: It isn't
exactly bad, but that repeated groan is not effective.
.. . .M.M. (Brighton): Weak little flutter. ... Gt.
Western: Do try to be natural; nobody in his senses
ever talked like that.... Ripponlea: A charming
narrative poem :
The widow woman was wan and worn,
Terribly were her clothes tattered and torn,
Her teeth gone and her cheeks hollow,
Through living in such desperate squalor.
The table was in a tear-moving state,
Scanty of bread and scanty of plate ;
Of a small seedy sausage, seven rounds
Had to feed seven kids wno were gaping around.
For herself some cold porridge did she find,
But to eat some sugar with it. she pined ;
She got the tin dish and With infinite pains
Did she scrape together a few miserable grains.
To her cry of delight the children listen’d,
For in the dish a diamond glisten’d.
“Now, darlings,” she cried, “there’s no need
to beg,
In future we’ll live on ham and eggs.”
. ...E.M. (Rangoon): You have the color, but the
yarn tails off to nothing.... Aitch M.: Stories of
30,000 words are no use here. The verse is very
p00r... .T.J.; “Repatriation” is lame stuff... .Scriv-
ener; Not enough interest.... Ernest A.: Ditto....
Alex. H.: “The Willow Tree” is a very commonplace
vegetable. .. .J. 5.8.; The Clean Sweep threatens lo
make port, but misses. It could be strengthened.
. ...V.R. (Balaclava): No yarn there... .A.S. (Bal-
main): The bird verse doesn’t strike u5....A.D,M :
“Summer” is fair, but says nothing new or very
striking. .. .A.C.W.: Too slight.... Nymus: Makes
noises, but doesn’t seem to say anything... .H.G.M.:
There isn’t much hope for an ear that can rhyme
“flaws” with “yours”....Mombak: The lay of the
converted motorist has a sob in every line: —
Speeding down the crowded street at forty miles an
hour,
The motorist swerved and hit the curb, and just
missed a cow,
A wheel was smashed,
Into a trolley he crashed,
And then he was seen,
Leaving his car
In the distance far,
Via the windscreen ;
Covered with gore,
He hit the door,
Of a warehouse over the way;
A panel was cracked,
And down he smacked,
And on the doormat lay.
He staggered to his. feet and cried
“O God, in that accident I might have easily diedt
But now I’ve learnt my lessen, and I’ll not speed,
Fifteen miles an hour I will not exceed;
I’ll toot my horn at every corner, at the crossings
I’ll slow clown;
Five miles an hour will be my limit in the busy
heart of town.”
. ...M.W.8.: It hasn’t got much of a punch....
Tas. M.: The idea is all right; see if you can’t
work it out in better verse. .. .W.J.T.: Doesn’t strike
u5....G.R.: The “Watch” verse is a bit too lumpy.
.... Colin S.: Goes very heavily and doesn’t say
enough.... Ding-Dong Dell: Your story’s in the well.

Do you know that dentists all the world
over now advise a new method of teeth
cleaning ? And that millions of people now
use it ? It combats the film —those dingy
coats, the cause of most tooth troubles.
This offers you a io-Day test, and we urge
that you accept it.
Means added beauty
Teeth are clouded by a film —that vis-
cous film you feel. Much of it resists the
tooth brush, clings and stays. Then it
forms dingy coats, and teeth lose their
lustre.
Film also holds food substance which
ferments and forms acid. It holds the acid
in contact with the teeth to cause decay. It
breeds millions of germs, and they, with
tartar, are the chief cause of pyorrhea. Very
few people, in the old days, escaped
troubles caused by film.
Protect the Enamel
Pepsodent disintegrates the film,
then removes it with an agent far
softer than enamel. Never use
a film combatant which contains
harsh grit.

Fight that Film
That’s what keeps your teeth so cloudy
Now they fight it
Dental science, after long research, has
found two ways to fight that film. One acts
to disintegrate the film at all stages of for-
mation. The other removes it without
harmful scouring.
A new-type tooth paste has been created
to apply those methods daily. The name is
Pepsodent. Careful people of some fifty
nations now use it, largely by dental advice.
Some old mistakes
Old ways of teeth cleaning reduced the
alkalinity of the saliva. They reduced its
starch digestant. And those are the factors
on which Nature depends to fight acids
and starch deposits. Pepsodent multiplies
that alkalinity, multiplies that starch diges-
tant. So every use gives manifold power to
these protective agents.
These things mean a new dental era.
They mean much to you and yours. So
we urge you to prove them out.

“Niloc”: Re “Wax’s” boost of silver-
wattle for axe handles (B. l/5/’24). I
have been buying handles for years made
from various Australian timbers, but (I
hate to say it) none has been equal to the
American hickory. If “Wax” is right, the
N.S.YV. Forestry Commissioners will be inter-
ested, as they still buy imported hickory
handles for the use of their own officers.
* * * *
“Sturt”: Adelaide has been proud of its
drainage system, completed some 40 years
ago, long before Melbourne’s. The spread
of population has, however, taken whole
suburbs into the near neighborhood of the
Sewerage Farm, behind Port Adelaide, and
a deputation lately waited on the Commis-
sioner of Works to complain of damage to
health. His reply was tentatively in favor
of moving the farm altogether.
“Tiny” : Ambergris may be worth £6 an
ounce in London (B. 8/5/’24), and I am
aware that Sydney Museum gives a similar
quotation. But the best offer I received
for a 7oz. lump that I picked up some years
ago on the beach at Warrnambool was from
a big Sydney firm of soap and perfume
fame, who stated that their price for amber-
gris was from 2s. Gd. per oz. upwards; they
further hinted that, as they were overstocked,
there wouldn’t be much upwards about it.
I don’t know when, if ever, I am going to
London, but I still have the lump.
* * * *
“Niloc” : Buying a house on the rent-pur-
chase system is like buying time-payment
furniture —ownership does not pass to the
buyer until the purchase is completed. Should
the seller become bankrupt before the last
instalment has been paid, he has a poor
chance of even getting his money back; he
will merely rank as a creditor in the bank-
rupt’s estate for the amount lie has paid. In
these days of speculative building the risk is
worth thinking about; it, at any rate, ought
to make a man careful to inquire about the
financial standing of the seller.
“George D.”: A day’s work in a Mel-
bourne pharmacy might make “Anaf” (B.
24/4/’24) doubt whether the “handy tablet”
has displaced dispensing to the extent he
indicates. My work this afternoon consisted
of compounding 16 mixtures, 4 ointments,
one batch of 100 pills and another of 12,
a batch of 24 cachets and one of 30 powders.
Only five patent and tablet preparations
Avere sent out. And that’s a fair sample
list. But there is one ready-made specific
that has elbowed out the old goods; it is
rare to-day to find an assistant who can
spread a good plaster.
* * * *
t “Hamer”: Recently the Electrical Trades
Union objected to a woman being employed
by a firm of electricians for anything less
than the full award wages of a fitter. There
was no attempt to dispute that a man em-
ployed on the same work would have been
entitled to a fitter’s wages; but it was argued
that he would have been expected to do other
and more skilled work as well. The firm’s
contention was that, when it saved a fitter’s
time by placing some of his less-important
work in a woman employee’s hands, the fact
did not make her a fitter. The magistrate
agreed, and ruled that there was no breach
of the award; and, on appeal, that decision
was maintained.
“Hannibel Swordfish”: “Parama” (B.
8/5/’24) wonders what is the largest find of
ambergris ever made off the Australian
coast. At Port Davey (s.-w. Tasmania) in
the early ’nineties, two colored men—Louis,
a native of Cape de Verde, and Black Harry
—were given the carcase of a whale by the
crew of a whaler who had stripped it of
the blubber. Louis, noticing indications of
sickness in the whale, conducted a post-
mortem by cutting his way into the inside,
and discovered ambergris to the weight of
several hundred pounds. The lucky pair
managed to get over 3001 b. to Hobart and
subsequently disposed of it at prices ranging
from £4 to £8 per ounce. Louis calculated
that about £4OOO worth of the stuff was
swept away by the tide. By the way, is
there not some synthetic product nowadays
replacing ambergris in the perfume industry?
* * * *
“R.G.N.C.” on the struggle for a crust: —
Fecklessness was the failing of Hereward Planta-
genet, whose Oxford manner and silver tongue had
secured him a capable Australian wife. She taught
music. Hereward tried various jobs, all of some
dignity, and failed at each. He even tried estate-
agenting and failed at that—this at a period when
the lady had added a tony “guest-house” to her
musical activities. It was after the estate-agency
failure that Mrs. P. jibbed. She was, she said, not
going to run a guestery, a music round and a home
as well. She was prepared to retain the round and
the home, but only on condition that her husband
took over the guest-house. Hereward agreed; he had
to —or starve. Very well he did it, too; I was a
“guest” for a season. He cooked and served the meals,
wheeled the course in on a dumb-waiter, and then,
slipping off his baize apron, took the head of the
table and presided, contributing refined and learned
conversations between the courses. It was a dignified,
almost pontifical ceremony, and the presence of an
undergrad, daughter added piquancy to the most
novel of menages. I never had pleasanter “digs.”

Messrs. JOHN SANDERSON & CO., 171 William Street,
Dominico Berlingo, charged in Adelaide
with attempted murder at Berri on the Mur-
ray, has gone to hospital in a dangerous con-
dition more suggestive of Eastern Asia than
of Australia. Left alone in his cell he was
presently found unconscious, with a nail in
his forehead just at the root of the hair. It
is supposed that he must have held it firmly
against the wall and butted it.
“Carolus”: Some families are well dis-
tributed about Australia. I had six brothers
when I left Adelaide for a trip to England
shortly before the war. One was settled in
Brisbane, another in Sydney, a third in Mel-
bourne. No. 4 was passed in the Great Aus-
tralian Bight, No. 5 met our boat at Fre-
mantle, and a day later, at sea, a wireless
came from No. 6, himself en route from Dar-
win to Perth in a coastal steamer.
“Hayeworray”: The Sydney agent put in
three solid hours with a Riverina cockie
recently, singing the merits and advantages
of the tractor over the horse. He was just
feeling confident of pulling off a sale when
Dad yawned disinterestedly and said, “Well,
when it’s wore out it’s done; but if it could
’ave a foal every other year it would be a
goldmine to a man, and I’d give you an
order.”
“Platman”: What wonderful war records
some of Australia’s little country townships
own ! I saw the other day an honor board
on Grandchester (Q.) railway station which
contained the names of 47 men. Of those
eight were killed in action, two died from
sickness and ten were wounded. Four got
military medals and two the D.C.M. What
hot corners that little band of Diggers must
have been in ! And one has to look hard to
find the township where there is only one
store.
“Amyl”: My official request to a Japanese
lady in a northern port to appear before me
for medical examination brought the follow-
ing typewriten reply
To Dr. Amyl, the Government Medical Officer.
Sir, —in responsed with your notice under the Health
Act 1900, J. 917 (section 158 (e) and regulation
10), No. 3707, that. I beg to apply you, you will

“Cancealed” accordingly.
“Devilfish”: Every once in a while some
pessimist combats the idea of an Australian
Navy or merchant marine with the state-
ment. that Australians will not take kindly
to the sea because they live on a continent.
But in the early days the complaint was
that Australians were too fond of blue
water. In 1805 Governor King, writing to
ITnder-Secretary Cooke said: “One cause of
the want of agricultural laborers is the num-
ber of men employed in the seal- and oil-
fisheries.” And Peter Cunningham, in 1826,
noted the love of the Currency lads for the
sea, and the fact that they made wonderful
seamen.
“Wee Bobbie”: This is my queerest-acci-
dent entry. The Gatemore was leaving the
wharf, and the after-spring, instead of being
fast to bitts about her quarter—owing to
deck cargo—came from where her stern lines
ran; consequently the steel wire came round
her counter and ran to a bollard forward
along the wharf. When the captain went
astern slow on the spring, so as to cant
her bows away from the wharf, the tighten-
ing spring jerked up along her side and de-
capitated one of the crew whose head
happened to be out of a porthole at the time.
Not only was his head cut off, but the snap
of the wire threw the gruesome relic 20 feet.
“E.D.”: Victor Daley met a footpad in
the Treasury Gardens (Melb). Victor had
just parted with Jack Graham, one-time
champion wrestler and a boxer of extraordi-
nary skill, when the tough approached and
said: “Gimme all yiv got in yer pockets or
I’ll bat you over the sconce with this, and
take it.” “My friend,” Daley replied, “I am
a poet and haven’t a sixpence; but if you
will go halves I will put you on to a good
thing. The man who just left me is a
banker; he is full of money.” “Good enough,”
said the thug, and went after Graham. Daley
stayed only long enough to see Graham
reach for the bad man and break up the
subsoil with his person.
“Oldtyme’s” meteorological note :
The Weather Bureau faithfully records “mean of
the max.” and “mean of the min.” temperature;
but that’s a poor thing, seeing that a lowest tempera-
ture may be of very brief duration, and highest
be of some hours, or vice versa. The dominant
fact is that maximums are of first importance during
hot weather, when comparative coolness during bed-
time fails to affect a citizen’s estimate of “a warm
summer,” whilst minimums are what matter most in
winter time. Statistics for Melbourne of late have
been quite out of harmony with what a citizen’s
own sense tells him. This was the coldest April
most of us could call to mind, yet the “mean tem-
perature” for the month was only 2.9° below Mr.
Hunt’s average. But the mean of the maximum
temperature, which is what matters, was no less
than 4.9° below the average. In January again,
the general mean was only 2.6° below the average,
whereas the mean of the max. was 3.9°. The moral
of all of which is: Disregard “mean temperatures”
if you don’t want to be misled.
“Schnorrer” : The Chosen People of these
parts are aggrieved with their kosher butch-
• ers ; there are about half a dozen of them in
Sydney and suburbs, duly licensed by the
Shechita Board attached to the Great Syna-
gogue. Most Jews, if they observe nothing
else, eschew pork; but a great many are care-
less about the general observance of kosher
—especially when kosher meat is as expensive
as the monopolists are making it. During
the recent Passover festival complaints were
made that some of the kosher butchers were
charging as much as 15s. for poultry which
ordinarily would have cost 9s. The Jewish
Chronicle recently attacked the overcharg-
ing traders, and a chorus approved the indict-
ment. “Kosher” is now the burning topic in
Jewry. Some blame the Shechita Board for
not insisting upon fair prices and withdraw-
ing licenses as a punishment for profiteering •
others want the communal kosher butcher’s
shop hurried on. Another suggestion is that
Jewish customers should boycott overcharg-
ing traders and live on fish till prices come
down.

10 perfect shaves
at our expense
You will agree that unless Palmolive Shaving Cream
offered conspicuous advantages we would surely not
ask you to test it at our expense. But, because the
use of it will give you an entirely new conception of
what a shaving cream should be and can do, we want
you to accept our free offer.
The first time Palmolive Shaving Cream is used its
difference from other shaving soaps or compounds will
at once be recognised.
Five distind advantages
(1) It multiplies itself in lather 250 times.
(2) It softens the beard in one minute.
(3) It maintains its creamy fullness for ten
minutes on the face.
(4) The bubbles are enduring. They support the
hairs for cutting, hold them upright so that the
razor goes through them and not over them.
(5) The after-effects are delightful —due to the
lotion-like properties of palm and olive oils.
We are confident that every tube of Palmolive Shaving
Cream offers certain shaving satisfaction. Cut out
the form below and secure a free ten-shave tube.

Here’s the Remedy
for Piles —Rexona
The Rapid
Healer.
'Lonmm
x.
“Having to work amongst
cattle and doirg a i«t -»f
riding on in wet
weatner_, caused me to suffer
with piles. Since using
Rexona Ointment I am com-
pletely cured and in the best
rf health, and would strongly
advise anybody to use same,
as it will give relief immedi-
ately.’'
Mr. CLARE LESLIE FOOT,
Springsure, Queensland.
Rexona Gives Prompt
Relief
Those who suffer from Piles are especi-
ally unfortunate in -that they cannot talk
about their complaint. They must suffer in
silence.
To all such Rexona comes as a great bless-
ing, for it is easily obtained, easily applied,
and the result is always gratifying.
The distressing symptoms quickly subside,
and mind and body both feel relief from the
constant strain almost after the first applica-
tion. In this Ointment are combined juices
and essences in an entirely new and unique
manner, forming a remedy justly celebrated
as a Rapid Healer.
Rexona is a remedy which is especially
valuable in the treatment of piles. Those
who try it will not be disappointed. Rexona
is sold everywhere at 1/6, or in pots holding
four times the quantity for 3/-

The Feet of the Gods.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
WHEN the red yarn of the sun
Runs in the shuttle of eve,
Magic of magic is spun
Into the carpets they weave;
And over the velvet pile,
Walking on peony air,
The gods in single file
Go with their ankles bare.
Only their ankles and feet
Forever and ever go by,
Swift and fading and sweet
Over the crimson sky
That hangs like a screen of silk
From the great looped purple above,
Where the small stars white as milk
Glow in the glooms they love.
Only the ankles and feet
Of the gods that glow and fade;
But somewhere their red hearts beat
And the white tables are laid
With dishes and vessels of light,
And the airs to a music thrill
With songs like the swallow flight
Of the sweetest singer’s will.
The gods their youth renew
In the broad river of day,
Bathed in the deeps of the blue
Where the highest winds are at play;
And none may see or know
Till the brown moth wings beat
And the carpets of evening glow
Under their homing feet.
Night comes from the east,
With her great stars in bloom,
Making the last and least
Of things great in the gloom
Where the silence comes stalking
The small voices that start;
But the feet of the gods are walking
In glory on my heart.
n.s.w.
DAVID McKEE WRIGHT.
The Confounding of Leary.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
course,” said my friend O’Shaugh-
nessy thoughtfully, “too much was
always enough for Leary. And on
Friday, anyhow, lie was by way of celebrat-
ing a deal he’d brought off with Heinie
Kummer, the Swiss German that lives out
on the range.”
Mid-afternoon was a quiet time in
O’Shaughnessy’s Club Hotel at Bingenup,
and the two of us at the moment occupied
the whole of its floor-space as we sat about
the linoleum-topped table in the small room
off the bar. Past O’Shaughnessy’s broad
shoulder I could see one dusty figure draped
disconsolately on the verandah-rail, one
dusty dog stretched in the middle of the
road, and one very old and very dusty Ford
car that stood before the general store of
Wilkins Bros. Bingenup did not always
show such a sorry front. At times, more
especially on Saturday mornings, it was diffi-
cult for the many assorted vehicles to find
standing- and hitcliing-room within reason-
able distance of O’Shaughnessy’s Hotel. But
now little heat devils danced in the shimmer-
ing air along a depressingly empty street.
And yet the fat voice of O’Shaughnessy
seemed full of a vague but cheerful content
as he rambled on. .
“You see,” he said, “Leary never did love
his neighbor as himself, and he’d managed
to sell Heinie, all in one try, a spavined
horse that he’d bought one day they passed
bad whisky into him at Bewerring and a
stump-jump plough that would jump every-
thing else but stumps. So Leary felt fit
for celebrating. And he certainly took a
power of the stuff when he went at it two-
handed-like and with his soul in it.
“At 10 o’clock he could still stand all
right, by means of stepping smartly and
regularly with one foot or the other in
whichever direction he happened to be fall-
ing at the moment. At half-past he couldn’t.
At 11 he started on his celebrated speech
about the wonderful things that Ireland had
done for humanity in the matter of states-
men, soldiers, poets and the like, not to
mention the saints. And an eloquent man
was Leary when he’d had enough. Though
his legs might be as harmonious as a brace
of pigs tied each by a foot and his centre of
gravity flying around him like a catherine-
wheel, he’d still be talking like a politician,
only sensibly.
“At half-past 11 he violently interrupted
to sit down sudden and heavy,
having let go the post to slap his fist into
his open hand, as was appropriate but fool-
ish. He left along about midnight with Big
Harvey that lives on the way to his place.
I wasn’t worrying at all about his getting
there. He’d always used to walk and crawl
home. There’s his old bay mare, not to
mention a moth-eaten grey and a roan colt
of his, back in the paddock now. He can
ride them in all right, you understand, but
every so-often he has to send a man in for
the collecting of all his horses. His place
is only about two or five miles out along the
Creek-road, and he’d never missed getting
there in time for milking yet.
“The next morning I was talking to
r ather Brown in this very room when I
heard Leary himself looking for me. The
door was closed, for the reason that Father
Brown was having his morning pot—more
power to him! —but not wishing to publish
the fact. I was just ready to slip out when
Leary _ came blundering in. The man was
as white as milk. His face was twisting all
ways at once, and there was a horrible kind
of ingrowing look about him. FI is mouth
was making all the motions of speech but
not getting beyond a sort of hissing sound,
like the words were simmering in him but
would not come to the boil. I took and
shook him.
, “ ‘ F or the love of God, L,eary,’ I said,
what’s up with you, man?’ For a matter
of long minutes he struggles with his speech-
lessness, and then real words come out of
him with a rush. ‘G-g-good morning, Father,’
he says; ‘I want a stiff whisky. Has
lvummer been in yet?’ Half to the Father
and half to me it was, but the lot in one
breath. I’m still a bit doubtful about him,
but he sits down and thumps the table here.
And.‘The swine,’ he says, ‘the dirty, German
swine!’
“Well, that sounded more like himself, and
we started to get him straightened out. And
the tale he had to tell was this. He’d got
home all right, he said, but being overcome
by weariness, as it might be, had somehow
dropped asleep in the little garden before
he could reach the door. That wasn’t hard
of understanding. He’d been so weary that
he didn’t stir till morning. And then he
went in the house to wake his wife. But
of Maggie Leary, he said, there was no sight
nor smell. A letter there was, though,
on the table. It was from Rummer, and
said just that ‘Maggie was come away. I
for long have wanted Maggie so to do,’ said
the letter. ‘And a sound woman,’ it finished
up, ‘may something make up for a sick horse.’
“That explained the wild look of Leary,
then. He said the shock must have knocked
the sense out of him, or perhaps he was
‘overcome by weariness’ again; but when
he came to he started straight for town as
the most likely place to find Kummer of a
Saturday morning. There were those, of
course, who woulfl be saying that the Ger-
man’s second bargain was the worse, hold-
ing that Maggie Leary was all of a sound
woman—nothing but it, indeed. Leary him-
self had spoken more than once about the
tongue of her. But Leary was hardly reason-
able at the moment, and there was murder
in his eye when he again inquires about
Kummer. Father Brown, after shifting his
pot further from Leary’s fist, has been look-
ing worried and sympathetic. ‘But what do
you mean to do to him, Leary?’ he asks.
“‘Do to him?’ says Leary. ‘Do to him, is
it? Kill him, what else? And make his life
a hell for him.’ He looked so mad and
thumped the table so reckless that Father
Brown put his beer on the floor beside his
chair and started to talk soothing words to
Leary.
“ ‘But, Leary, you can’t be doing that,
man,’ he says. ‘The fellow’s a wicked scoun-
drel, then, no doubt. But murder and
violence accomplish nothing, Leary. There’s
the law and the good God to look after the
punishment of such as he.’
“ ‘Oh yes, indeed,’ sneers Leary in a
savage voice; ‘fine words those, Father. But
haven’t I heard ye say y’rself that the law’s
no better than a jackass? And the good
God’s too good for Germans, anyway.”
“Just then I heard Rummer’s voice in the
bar beyond. By the mercy of Heaven Leary
was too busy telling the Father some more
of what he was going to do to hear it, and
I slammed the door fast with me foot.
Father Brown had taken off his hat and
settled down with the light of battle in his
eyes such as he always gets when he sets
about dealing with the real hard cases. It
was easy to see that he w r as in for a tough
time of it. Leary was just sitting there,
sullen and pig-headed as might be, so I
slipped out quietly to get a little something
that might soften the hard heart of him.
And I wanted to tell Kummer a word or
two for his own good; but I found he’d
gone off to the other end of the town to see
his brother that has a blacksmith shop there.
“Back I went to Leary with the glass;
’twas. always a good argument with him.
The little man’s still spitting bloody murder,
and Father Brown’s into his work with his
pants well hitched and his sleeves rolled up,
so to speak. And if ever a man spoke with
the tongue of angels it was Father Brown
when he gave his mind to it. If anyone was
the equal of Leary drunk, it was the Father,
drunk or sober. Not meaning anything by
that last, of course—just a manner of speak-
ing. But with all the soft speech and honey-
dripping voice of him, he was hoeing a hard
row with Leary.
“ ‘ ’Tis heaping coals of fire on his head,
this forgiving of a sinner,’ says the Father.
‘ ’Tis heaping bricks I’d rather be,’ says
Leary. ‘Vengeance is mine, saith the Lord,’
says the Father. And ‘I only want Him
to lend it me for a minute,’ says Leary.
_ “Leary swallows the whisky I’d brought
him as if it had been water, and Father
Brown takes a set to his jaw that means
he’s only just starting business. So I slipped
out again to get a little more for the soften-
ing of Leary.
“Well, I’m telling you, man, for two and
a half hours by the clock the great fight
went on. For two and a half long hours
the good Father wrestled with the black
devil of. murder that sat in the soul of
Leary. ’Twas a thing he could never abide
to think of, being defeated by any evil spirit.
And a heart of stone must have melted to
that touching appeal. It all but brought
the tears to me eyes as I stood there; but
Leary just hunched his shoulders and swal-
lowed his whisky and grunted every once
in a way.
“The day was hot, and Leary so stubborn,
and the sweat was soon rolling down the
Father’s red face. But the thought of weak-
ening was not in him. He took off his black
coat, and he undid his stiff collor, and he
stormed and he pleaded and he coaxed and
he all but cursed to bend the stiff neck of
Leary. A grand fighter for a soul is Father
Brown. And soon enough Leary was show-
ing symptoms of eloquence himself. Every
so-often I’d seen that his glass had some-
thing in it, having great faith in that same.
At it they went, horse and foot, and seldom
it is I’ve heard a finer argument. ’Twas
a treat to listen to the two of them.
“But the Father was the stronger in the
end, aided and abetted by that glass along-
side Leary; and somewhere in the middle of
the day the little man, with a tear in his eye
and a catch in his voice, confessed that he’d
be damned if he wouldn’t forgive anybody
anything. Father Brown heaved a great
sigh and dropped back in his chair as if
he’d been shot, and it’s little he could bo
blamed for that.
. “But just then, clear as could be, sounds
the voice of Kummer from the bar. Before
I could turn ’round Leary’s through the door
and lather Brown after him, not wasting
Lme to fasten his collar or put on his coat.
The little man’s standing in front of Heinie
when I get there. His face is red and his
hands twitching a bit, but there’s no hostili-
ties. Kummer looks first at Leary and then
at Father Brown. And a puzzling sight is
the Father with his sweaty face and ruffled

AID THE KIDNEYS.
Do Not Endanger Life when there
is a Way to Avoid It.
Why will people continue to suffer the agonies of
kidney complaint, backache, urinary disorders, lameness,
headaches, languor? Why allow themselves to become
chronic invalids when a tested remedy is offered them?
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills have been used in Kidney
trouble for years, and have been tested in thousands of
cases. If you have any, even one, of the symptoms of
kidney disease, act now. Serious kidney disease may
set in and make neglect dangerous. Sydney testimony is

A MAN’S CASE.
Mr. William Carroll, sen., ex-railway guard, 749 Harris
►street, Pyrmont, Sydney, says“ Some time ago I strained
myself pushing some heavy trucks, and soon noticed the effect
m the small of my back. For three solid months I was unable
to work, and was laid up. I had a very lame back, and a dull
pain through the loins and kidneys, and my secretions became
unnatural and irregular. I consulted a doctor, who recom-
mended Turkish baths; but, though I got a little ease, I could
not work. I used Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, and obtained
wonderful relief; in fact, so much so that I can now do heavy
work. I am fully convinced that Doan’s Backache Kidney
Pills are a true Kidney remedy, and I never, fail to recommend
them among my friends.”
Twenty years later Mr. Carroll says:—“l am still a
great believer in Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills. They cured
me many years ago, and by taking them now and again I keep
in splendid health.”

Mrs. M. Whitbread, sen., “Amherst,” Napoleon Street,

backache and kidney trouble, and was at times so ill that I had
to lie up for days. My back ached terribly, and I was almost
crippled with the ailment, every movement making the pam
worse. My ankles and legs swelled, considerably, and I knew
this was a sign of dropsy. I also had trouble with the secre-
tions, was subject to dizziness, and felt tired and languid. 1
was really far from well, and having seen Doan’s Backache
Kidney Pills advertised at different times, it at last occurred to
me to try this remedy. I got some, and it proved a blessing,
giving quick relief, and gradually •effected a perfect cure. I teel
splendid now, and have only Doan’s Backache Kidney Pius to
thank for my wonderful recovery.”
Two years later Mrs. Whitbread says:—“My cure lias
proved a permanent one, no sign of kidney trouble having
returned since Doan’s Pills cured me over two years ago.

“Leary swallows hard, and Father Brown
says: ‘Steady now, Leary,’ like a man cluck-
ing to a fractious horse. Then Leary talks
slo\v, like a ten-year-old telling his lesson.
" ‘l’m not going to kill you, Kummer.' he
says, ‘and ye can thank the good Father
here for it. But may God fry your soul in
Hell for all’——
. no - man!’ cries Father Brown
quickly. ‘Be Christian, Leary, and forbear-
ing. So is the sinner shamed and maybe
brought to repentance. Say, rather, may
God forgive you as I do.’
“ 'l’m agreeable to that,’ promptly answers
Leary. ‘May God forgive you as I do,
Kummer, ye dirty, black-hearted mongrel!’
“As he said it, it was the most powerful
forgiving I ever heard. Kummer has been
standing there looking at the two of them
with his mouth open.
“‘A good woman was Maggie,’ goes on
Leary; ‘a good woman, ye hell-hound,
until’
“ ‘Ach, yes-s,’ says Kummer smiling; ‘I
now understand it. Mad, I was thinking
you. Good woman—yes-s. A good servant
she was, but a better wife she will be, yes-s.’
“‘Servant!’ mutters Leary in a strangled
voice. ‘Servant?’
“‘Surely, yes-s,’ burbles Kummer; ‘the
letter did tell. Your servant-woman, Maggie
Smith Yesterday afternoon to Bewerring we
drive and married get. The letter I leave
for you to tell.’
“ ‘Servant!’ says Leary again like a
stunned man. He looks at Father Brown
and the Father looks at him. ‘Of course,
her name was Maggie, too,’ he says as if
explaining to a kindergarten class. ‘Maggie
Smith, if was.’ He falls silent then and
thoughtful for a while, and standing behind
him I can see the red neck of Father Brown
getting redder. And then Leary begins to
chuckle.
“‘ls it funny?’ asks Father Brown..
“ ‘Funny it is,’ says Leary, ‘now that I
remember. Why, didn’t I drive Mrs. Leary
meself, early yesterday morning, over to her
sister s place on the Creek to be staying
there a few days! And it's me that forgot
all about it. Did ye ever hear the like?'
“ 'I never did,’ says Father Brown; and
with that bang goes the big fist of him into
Leary’s eye. as clean a dirty left as ever
I saw. ‘Wasting me time,’ he says, and
squash goes his right on Leary’s nose. ‘On
a day like this,’ he continues, ‘ye flat-footed
beef-swiping. . . .blot on the earth!’—
with appropriate actions. Then he brushes
his coat and fastens his collar. ‘And may
the Lord forgive you!’ he remarks to Leary
as he walks out.”

the direction taken by the good Father. ‘Fol-
lowing it I saw that the lonely figure on the
verandah had now the other leg hooked over

stirred.
“And that.” said O’Shaughnessy, rising and
ostentatiously lifting our glasses to wipe
the table-top, “that was the second time that
words failed Leary inside a few hours.”
A. M. HASEN.
Visiting Aunt Julia.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
OW that Easter is over I see
I our annual visit to Aunt Julia loom-
ing. Aunt Julia is the wife’s aunt
—she who went to live “on the outskirts.”
Any Sunday now I may be hauled out of
bed before 11, made to bolt my dinner and
catch the 1.30 p.m. to Clayville. From Clay-
ville station we strike north-west for two
miles across a plateau of clay, - baked into
ridges like a currycomb. This was once a
number of grazing paddocks, but is now a
maze of choice building lots dotted with
houses in course of erection. Seeing these
the old subject of “putting down a deposit”
(this being a technical term which trips
from the tongue of the house-agent) will be
revived by the wife. There will ensue the
same old discussion about 71 per cent, on the
unpaid balance. We invariably worry this
bone while jolting over the currycomb, and
the “young feller” who travels with the
wife’s flapper sister will go into reckoning,
and will then instruct us exactly how few
years we shall have left to live when the
total is" at last paid. Our attention will be
called to the “For Sale” ads., which, like
pale spectres, accentuate the wastes of Clay-
ville’s outskirts. Often I have been urged
to “snap” one of these allotments, and as
often I have promised “to think about it”
—“be valleybel in a few years,” uncle will
say. “Look at my lot —did I ever tell ye
what I gave for’t?” He has. And Uncic
Tom knows that he has, and rather than
hear him again I’d go back for a gun. But
perhaps in regard to the “sale” boards, the
“coupla chaps” will also promise to think
about it. The same old lie forms so
naturally upon the tongue of all who visit
Aunt Julia since she went to the outskirts —
which, in my opinion, is synonymous with
going to Hades. A/propos this land discus-
sion, the wife will once more charge me with
thriftlessness. Will it hurt? Ah, no. ’Tis
but the yeast of the annual visit, working
on her temper.
By this time we will have left the ville
end of Clayville behind ; but the first syllable
will accompany us all the way. Think of
that joyous walk across the currycomb!
We will advance, too, in the eye of the sun,
I bearing the baby on one arm. with frank-
incense and myrrh on the other —that is to
say, tobacco and pipe-cleaners for Uncle
Tom, husband of the wife’s aunt. On our
arrival she, dear old soul, will have just
finished milking, and her welcoming smile
,will be adorned with specimens of cow’s
hair, red, brindle, brown. She will fill us
up with the lacteals foaming in her bucket,
hoping that one day in the year of vitami-
nous food will atone for the dietetic errors
of the remaining 364.
Later on Aunt Ju, the wife, the flapper
sister, the “young feller,” the children, Uncle
Tom and “a coupla chaps that uncle knows,”
with myself, will form a phalanx to begin
the rounds. First the fowlruns. Again I
shall be asked to adjudicate between the Reds
and the Buffs. I know naught of either,
but this is Aunt Ju-Ju’s way—to bring out,
tactfully, any acumen I may be thought to
have.
Uncle Tom has a “kink” for poultry. I
shall hear him orating to the “coupla chaps”
on the profit or otherwise of the hen, with
the fluctuations of the egg market. “Ye
don’t want t’ feed ’ens all tli’ year round
an’ then ’ave eggs drop on ye,” he will say.
But who does? Even the old rooster, when
interrogated, will back me up in my belief
that no one really cares to have eggs dropped
on him.
A pen of filthy ducks will next claim atten-
tion. These are bubbling at the gills in a
dirty dam and looking slyly at us through a
cloud of mosquitoes. And Aunt Julia will
graciously promise me a pair of the guzzling
things for Christmas, and I shall shudderingly
thank her. But never, I determine, sotto voce
—no, never again, after seeing the ducks
during their meal hours —will I dine off
them.
Uncle Tom here will complain : “Forty pair
we ’ad larst Christmas an’ eggspected to coin
money on ’em, and d’you know wot ’ap-
ened?” Then he looks round in surly triumph
waiting for our interest and surprise. Too
well we know what happened—it happened
before Uncle had a duckery, and always will
happen. There was a glut of poultry.... or
a ring .... Or a bunch of profiteers. What
happened!
When the soiled ducks are done with we
stagger through the nettle forest to a pear-
tree and crane our necks toward the baby
pears, two in number, that this excellent tree
has brought forth. They certainly were there
yesterday. Like Sarah, this tree has not
hitherto performed her duty; but this season
she has atoned by bearing twins.
“There they are,” says Uncle Tom, “on the
top branch.”
As we strain for a glimpse of Gemini we
will hear yet again of Clayville’s unsuita-
bility for fruit-growing. The information is
superfluous, the fact being, self-evident. Clay-
ville’s forte is weeds.
By this time one of the children wall be
found choking. A hooked forefinger will
extract from the glottis a pear the size of a
hird’s egg.
Ha! One of the Gemini! The other is
picked up later by the infant, and, not being
extracted in time, will cost a doctor’s fee.
Though the pear-tree will not help us “eat
more fruit” there are still the apples. Rosy
Jonathans. Very fair, too —if we don’t look
the other side. Thai is the codlin’s area.
Yet, really, it is possible to get a mouthful
from some of the Jonnos without eatihg
worms when they appear on the menu for
Christmas Day.
About this time those of us not already
blinded by headache will be invited to stare
at Aunt Ju.’s dazzling iron roof, to see the
“dear starlings.” Aunt Julia is a birdlover.
The starlings are there all right—busy in the
spouting; nesting or flirting, I don’t know
which. It is immaterial, anyhow. The re-
sult to the water-supply is the same; yet
Aunt Ju. will still brag of her “tank water.”
No wonder Uncle Tom has boils. For my
part I shall save my thirst.
Nature blighted in its youth now claims
our attention as we stamp aimlessly around
-—feeble growths expected to be edible in
December, and (Uncle will add) “God will-
ing.” He does this as a talisman against
drought and garden pests. But as yet it has
not availed to any extent. This vernal month
my relatives would have had green peas “ex-
cept for the slugs” ; strawberries “only, for
the sparrows.” The carrot-bed, too, would
look more wholesome “only for Spotty” (the
dog), who makes- a bone-cemetery of it.
Even as Uncle Tom lugubriously repines, the
cat and kittens gambol amid the parsley.
The fact is, Uncle and Aunt are too diverse
in their interests. Why do they not concen-
trate on one kingdom at one time? Cabbages
and canines will not mix.
“Ah, well,.we will make something of the
place yet,” Uncle will say. “And always
look on the bright side,” Aunt Julia will add,
with her patient, cowhaired smile.
As it is, we look on the dark side —the last
hours of an apricot-tree, done to death by
fungi. But, as a set-off, there is the sultana
vine in bud; and we are told how “last year"
—indeed right back to Genesis —that same
vine would have yielded something wonderful
“only for the caterpillars.”
In passing a peach-tree I shall take care
to pinch its quartette of children —hard. For
why should this tree have a monopoly of
fruition? Yes, I shall certainly give them a
pinch. And by-and-bye Uncle will tell how
“only for some fool” peach sundaes would
have been theirs for the picking.
The day will drag on. Aunt’s dogs will
rub their dusty coats against my trousers
and lick the baby. The magpie will peck the
red hands of the “coupla chaps.” They will
bleed and look better for it, being full-blooded
cliooms “from Home.”
Supper will be a monotone of eggs. With
my tiepin I will t>ick Brindle’s all-pervading
hairs from a loving cup of milk. Thus
strengthened, we will endure Aunt Julias
rendering of “Annie Laurie” and “I Ganna
Leave the Old Horse”—l mean “house."
through which I shall yawn, and yawn, till
—click! My upper set falls out and bounces
beneath the table. By this device I am
spared the hypocrisy of applauding “Lar-
board Watch” on the gramophone. Verily.
I do evil that good may come.
By the time “Washington Post” has been
rendered the shades of night will be falling-
fast, and we can do openly what we have
done by stealth ever since our arrival —con-
sult our watches and talk time-table. “Get-
ting late.... Must make tracks.” Darkness
on the currycomb would be disaster indeed.
The report that Aunt Julia’s clock is run-
ning slow causes a panic. Good heavens! —
we might miss the train and be compelled
to stay all night. The gods forbid! One
day a year “on the outskirts” were paradise
enow for anyone. So we thrust ourselves
into coats, and hats are rammed home. Bal-
ancing the baby and a few dozen eggs we
receive Aunt Julia’s benediction and a few
cowhairs; then make a bolt for it.... and
wait threequarters of an hour on Clayville
Station for the train. Evidently the clock
was working fast No matter! We have
escaped. As we sprawl on Clayville’s one
seat we shall give thanks. Aunt .Julia’s
visit is over.

To look we!Land be well
to be really “fit”—at your best, in fact, as Nature
intended —is a desirable thing. If such is not your
experience, you should know that to be really well is
impossible if you allow yourself to suffer from any
digestive ailment. An unhealthy state or irregular
action of the stomach, liver and bowels means lowered
vitality, depression of spirits and is the cause of many
ills. It is most unwise therefore to disregard or neglect
any derangement of them. If you desire good appetite,
sound digestion, natural, healthy action of the stomach,
bowels, liver and kidneys,
you should take
Beecham’s Pills. This medicine used in accordance
with the directions, has a marked tonic effect upon
the digestive system and, by stimulating it to proper
activity, renews the general health in a very remarkable
and satisfactory manner.

DEWAR’S
An optimist is happy to-day because he
believes to-morrow has something better
in store for him. And so a true optimist
is always happy. Optimism has its
limitations though, for to-morrow can
never have anything better to offer than
But that doesn’t worry an optimist; it
pleases him!
