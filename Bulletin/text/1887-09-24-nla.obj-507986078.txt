Jubilee Literature.
“ It is the third Gate of Barbarism—the Monarchical Gate
—which is closing at this moment. The nineteenth century
hears it rolling oh its hinges."— Victor Hugo.
Nearly three months have passed since, on
a glorious English midsummer day, a carriage
escorted by foreigners made its way through
the principal streets of London and drew up
at the British Pantheon, Westminster
Abbey. The Sovereign of England descended
and entered the sacred edifice to thank the
Giver of all Good fur having shielded herself
and her throne from harm during the long
period of fifty years. It was a sight never
to be forgotten by those fortunate enough to
witness it. All that the world could show
of civilised and barbaric pageantry was pro-
duced for the occasion, and as the noise of
clamour and cannon subsided, the hearts of
the favoured few inside the Abbey walls and
of the vast multitude outside went out to
the elderly lady who amidst such pomp
humbly knelt to ask a continuance of
heaven’s favours for herself and her people*
Erom the ends of the earth came men and
women to bear a part in the gallant show.
Dasky Indian princes whose turbans’ jewels
and horses’ trappings wo aid pay the coat of
a campaign were there ; so too, were sturdy
Australians, prosperous colonists who years
before had left the British Islands in tatters
to return in broadcloth —who sailed from the
old home because of the difficulty experi-
enced in securing enough to eat; kfo it as
starving Radicals fuming against laws which
levelled their hovels to make way for deer
and grouse, to return as sleek Conservatives,
staunch upholders of property’s inalienable
rights. Even a small Pacific island sent its
dark-skinned Queen to the great thanks-
giving. The share accruing to the Monarch
of Hawaii from a successful investment in a
contraband cargo enabled his consort to
appear in London in a manner befitting her
high station and the dignity of her wide
realm. This is the potentate, it will be re-
membered, whose ccachman had secret
orders from the Lord Chamberlain to drive
swiftly in the wrong direction and so miss
the procession. She, also, it is who very
properly objected to an escort of hussars,
rightly deeming that one who reigned by the
grace of God was as well entitled to the at-
tendance of life-guards as her fairer cousins.
♦ ♦ •
But it ia not so much with the pageant
we have to deal as with the poetry and prose
written to celebrate it. Long before the
birth of 1887 the magazines and newspapers
throughout the Empire gave many ind .ca-
tions of the approach of a period of unrest.
All seemed to bo in labour, and anxious for
a speedy delivery. Some of the offspring,
in the shape of “ retrospects ” and “Jubilee
odes,” came into the world before their time.
Still, whether born prematurely or aftsr the
full period of gestation, the birth-mark of
stupidity was plainly visible on all. Between
English Tennyson and Australian Halloean
the race for absurdity was for some time
doubtful. Even now there are those who
assert that the event between these two was
a dead heat, and should he run over again.
On the whole, bowerer, we are inclined to
think the peer won by a head. At all
events, we trust that the injudicious friends
of each will come to some understanding,
even if the stake has to be divided, rather
than insist on a fresh trial. Why we lean
towards Lord Tennyson’s side is because, in
some of his couplets, there is to be found a
mastery of nonsense to which the Australian
cannot, as yet, justly lay claim. Still, it is
but fair to say that if the latter had had the
former’s experience, or if he had taken
greater care in pruning a few of ffhe more
sensible expressions in his ode,
for supremacy would have been closer. We
put forth these opinions in the hope that on
the next great public festival, such as a
coronation or even the betrothal of one of
the Prince of Wales’s clever sons, the New
South Wales poet may rise to the occasion
by judiciously omitting anything with a sus-
picion of common-sense.
* ft *
From the list of those children of song
who have done so much to make ordina ty people
writhe at the sotmd bf the word “ jubilee ”
there are two names conspicuously absent.
They are those of Sir Henry Parkes and
of W. B. Sladen. Hjw ic came that Mr.
Sladen, whose comprehensive muse went
into harness with easy indifference in pres-
ence of a thunderstorm among the Blue
Mountains or a fallen gum-tree at Dead Dog
Gully, missed the procession to Westminster
Abbey is not quite clear. He was in Eng-
land at the time —is there still, so far as we
know. It may be, no doubt, that he sang
the event, but that his song has not yet
reached Australia. This supposition, al-
though possible, is Highly improbable. For
no one who has read the productions of this
gifted lyrist woul 1 rest content on hearing he
had published something fresh until placed
in po:session of h. The omisuon is inex-
plicible. In the absence of any Jubilee
poem from Mr. Sladen, it is mournful to
turn to his “Poetry of Exiles and Australian
Lyrics” and imagine how much fuller and
richer our Saxin tongue would be to-day
had the June promenade or the July naval
review attracted his notice. In the “Ad-
dress to Longfellow and America,” to be
found in the book mentioned, there are
stanzas with the true poetic ring. For
instance: —
“ I think that the noblest future for an Austral
bird would be
To become to all Australia what thou wast across
the sea,
To have her youth’s flower round him in an Uni-
versity,
And to have the whole dominion ringing with his
poetry.”
Yes; the absence of Mr. Sl Aden's name
from the roll of Jubilee singers is a national
loss. Sir Henry Parkes, of course, may
excuse himself with the plea that, not having
been present, he could not do the occasion
justice. This is a poor excuse at the best.
He has been in London, has seen the Abbey,
and probably knows the whole route taken
by the procession. Surely his imagination
could fill in the details. He was not beside
the brook while composing the “Murmurs of
the Stream,” but brought away the impres-
sions in his head, and wrote while they were
fresh upon him. It is this aptitude for re-
cording in entirely original language what he
has ones seen that gives such a freshness and
raciness to the Premier’s delightful book,
The fact is, whether through indolence tr
inadvertence, Sir Henry let slip an opportu-
nity for showing that the spirit of poetry is
not quenched by the removal of its possessor
from the fogs of England to the clear atmos-
phere of Australia.

There is one department of literature that
leaves a particularly bad taste on the reader’s
mouth, It is that written during the lives
« f sovereigns, and dealing with their virtues
or their ta'ents. No one who has not the
soul of a lacquey can glance without disgust
at the pages where vulgar and ignorant man
and women are clothed with the attributes of
gods. And in the wide world there is no
literature which contains so much of this
nauseating stuff as the British. We chal-
lenge any man possessing an ordinary sense
of human dignity to read what has been
written about English monarchs without ris-
ing from the perusal with a contempt for his
kind. Nor is it possible to blink the fast
that when anything specially fulsome had to
be said—anything tending to p’ace a royal
pimp on the pedestal of a patriot or sage ; a
royal trull on that of a vcistal —there was al-
ways a priest in readiness to tay it. Not to
go back to Plantagenbt, Tudor, or Stuart,
with the ghastly lies of parasites ever in
their ears, it is enough to glance at what
was said and sung of the Georges while
those worthies occupied their island throne.
In “ Gulliver’s Travels ” there are chapters
so revolting that the reader’s gorge rises. A
somewhat similar feeling is experienced at
every page in the innumerable pages filled
by court chroniclers of the Hanoverian
regime when extolling the lives or lamenting
the deaths of their royal masters. When
Caroline, wife of George 11., ordered the
Archbishop and his coadjutors to take them-
selves and their mummery from the chamber
so that she might die in peace, the prelate
appears before the public with the good news
that her Majesty died “ in a heavenly frame
of mind.” Assuming that the frame of mind
in which Caroline of Anspach commenced
the future was a “heavenly ” one, no sinner
need despair. And when her husband who,
on being informed that his father was dead
and he was King of England, yelled “ Dat is
one big lie !” lay in his coffin with the well-
earned reputation of having been the vnl-
garesfc little scoundrel in Europe, another
parson elbowed his way to a bishopric with—
“ No farther blessing could on earth be given—
The next degree of happiness was—heaven !”
• •• *
On the table before ua is a pile of Jubilee
literature which fills us with dismay. To go
through it all would require more time than
we have to spare, but we have examined
enough of it t) convince us that the spirit of
flunktyism is still alive and vigorous. Iu
the course of 800 years a British monarch
has been found who manages to live decently,
and the world is invited to witness the sin-
gular phenomenon. We give in to none in
our respect for the negative virtues of
the Sovereign who turned her back on
the bluciei opies sent her by a ljug
line of illustrious rogues, and began a
clean record on a clean sheet. The great
lesson we owe to England’s Qaeen is that
there is no necessary connection between
monarchy and active turpitude. To w ait eight
centuries for such a lesson may seem a little
tedious ; but monarchy, like the mills of the
gods, grinds slowly. There is a class of per-
sons, however, whom the Sovereign should
never forgive—persons whom she should net
only punish herself but direct her successor
('f any) to pursue with relentless rigour.
They are those who, in the magazines and
journals in front of us, call the last 50 years
the “ Victorian era” and carry their vin-
dictiveness so far as to attribute to her
fostering care the advance made in all de
partments of human knowledge during that
long period. These are the real enemies of
monarchy, tnd foremost amongst them stand
the traitor or traitors (no single person would
contain so much savage rancour) who, in
cold blood penned the J übilee articles in the
London Times. Not satisfied with opening
a branch for the palming eff of Irish auto-
graph letters with the signature on the
wrong side, this merciless breed-sheet aims
at nothing leas than bringing the throne
itself into c ntempti This it does in a man-
ner as alroit as it is barefaced Trivialities
worthy of the nursery or of the cHche are
givtn with an attention provocative of
mirth, while to Ber Gracious Majesty are
assigned traits and talents hitherto carefully
hidden. Thus we read that, during the pro-
cession, the ruler’s “ white bonnet, a tribute
to the exultant joy of her subjects, was re-
garded as a sign of especial good-will.” Poor
Lord Lorne’s mishap, too — he missed his
horse, it will be ream mbered, in attempting
to sit down—is a’luded to with unbecoming
levity. The Marquis, it appears, was dressed
in Highland costume, an attire which does
not readily lend itself to t questrianism, and
the Times observes, “lucktly he fell on the
soft side, along Constitution Hill.” This is
not alone flippant, but ambiguous.
♦ * *
The Westminster Review, also, has an
article on the subject, in which occasion is
taken to say a good word for Imperial
Federation, with the rather droll admission
that the writer is not quite sure what is the
precise meaning of the term. To return to
the Times, It continues ; “ The arrival of
the Duke of Cambridge with the Home
Guards staff provoked, as was natural, much
cheering, since England could hardly pro-
duce a more distinguished company of mili-
tary men.” This is humour of a high order
Prince George is so distinguished that, had
ho enlisted in a marching regiment where
the requirements were not too severe, he
would before this have risen to be corporal,
with the prospect of an additional chevron,
for long service and good conduct. Con-
nected with tthe British Array there is one
leading characteristic which has always won
the approbation of foreigners. When a
person is not quite fib to be a sergeant he is
made commander-in-chief. Foreigners, es-
pecially, should be thankful for this wise
provision which has saved so many of them
in the past, and will, no doubt, do likewise
in the future. Referring to Trafalgar Square
during the progress, we get:—“Here, too,
there was a hoarse and continuous roar.
* Here she is ; I have seen her ; she is alive I
roared a sturdy patriot from the East-end,
and his companions of the crowd entered
into his delight,” We have no doubt. The
very expression “ she is alive ” is one that
could be relied on to awaken a sympathetic
response in an East end gentleman’s breast.
A few more extracts from the Times and we
have done :
“ For 60 years the Queen has associated herself
with all the sorrows and all the happiness of her
people. . . In their entire compass no scene
was ever depicted on canvas, narrated by his-
torian, or conjured up by a poet’s fancy, more
pathetic or more august than the spectacle of
Victoria, Queen and Empress, kneeling there at
the foot of the throne to thank Heaven for her
reign. . . Chief among the works to which the
Prince Consort and the Queen set their hands was
to improve the condition of those lowest in the
social sca’e . . to raise them in the scale of
humanity. . . No calamity which causes misery
and distress leaves her unmoved; she is ever fore
most with her purse and sympathy in aid of the
sufferers.”
» * *
Let us leave this Jubilee literature —it
sickens and disgusts. Away with it to the
ash-heap and the dust-hin. It has brought
the very name of Briton into derision. Men
look at tach other and say, “ Can those who
write and those who read such senseless
jargon be the descendants of the stubborn
people who two centuries ago sent one ruler
to the block and another into exile ?” Is
Lear in his desolation, or Mary at the foot
of the cross, less pathetic in the poet’s page
or on the painter’s canvas than a short,
stout, elderly lady lisping stereotyped
prayers on a well-stuffed cushion ? For
shame ! It is time the third gate of Bar-
barism, the Monarchical gate, closed for
ever, if only to shut the mouths of the abject
creatures who, by their abject iosensatediiv el,
invite alike the contempt of gods and men.

David Buchanan, having wrestled with
Farrar’s “ Life of Christ,” and Renan’s work on
the same subject, says “Farrar, believing Our
Saviour to be a God, makes him a man Renan,
believing Him to be a man, makes Him a God.”
Byron once remarked that, “ If ever God was

PLAIN ENGLISH.
Protection and Overproduction.
When vanquished upon all their stock arguments,
Freetraders have a peculiar habit of falling back
on the assertion that Protection would “ inevit-
ably lead to over-production.” The factories
called into existence by a festering tariff would, it
is said, soon produce more than consumers re-
quired and then prices would fall. Before meet-
ing the argument on its merits, it would be as
well to point out that it is nothing more than
over-production which causes the present depres-
sion and distress. In N. S. W. the policy of Freetrade
has long since proved itself incapable of inducing
over-production with all the resultant evils of such
a state ; we need not wait for a change of policy to
bring about the disasters from which we are now
suffering deeply. The supply of goods of all kinds
has at the present time exefesded the demand
because all the factories of the world are allowed
access to our lecal markets; things could be no
worse if over-production were the outcome of the
efforts of our own to-be protected factories. For
in the litter case the country would at least bo the
richer by the increment of value of our raw
material worked up, and therefore better able to
withstand the strain of depression. This point is
not usually sufficiently regarded. Take any ton
of iron now in tho ground and absolutely worth-
less so long as it remains there; Smelt it and it is
worth (say) £2; make it into steel rails, and it is
worth (say) £lO ; that sum represents the wealth
added to the national stock. Many thousand tons
would necessarily be manufactured before there
was any over-production, and there would be in-
crease of national wea’th in every ton. For every
one ton over produced, one hundred tons
would have been eagerly bought. Little conse-
quence to the manufacturer if one ton should fail
to find a ready buyer, if 100 tons had already
been sold at a good profit; little matter to the
worker that he should lose one week’s labour,
when he had been employed at a high rate of
wages for three years previously ; and little loss
to the country that the wealth represented by one
ton of steel should depreciate when 100 tons of 1c 1
cally-created wealth of the same denomination had
already enriched the community. But the danger
of over-production, when only local labour is em-
ployed in supplying the local demand for goods, 1s
very much less than under the Freetrade system.
Home manufacturers can better calculate the sum
of local requirements than antipodean operatives,
who know nothing of our state, are able to do.
And in the eight hour system we have another
safeguard a jainst the latest bogey raised by Free-
traders. At present the bulk of our goods are sup-
plied by foreigners who work from 66 to 84 hours
per week, but such industrial slavery can never
be introduced here, unless the Freetraders’ dream
of the “brotherhood of labour” prevails, and
Australian workmen are brought down to the
level of Englishmen, Germans, or Chinese.
Strengthened by a limitation of outside competi-
tion, our labourers will be enabled to maintain
their independence ; exposed to unrestricted com-
petition with the industrial galley-slaves of
Europe, they may become as degraded as those
oppressed, dependent, and helpless serfs of Capi-
tal with whom they now strive for their daily
bread. The M‘Million was indulging in no
flight of fancy when he said that “ Freetrade
meant Ihe brotherhood of labour.” He was talk-
ing sound common-sense, bat ho omitted to state
that tho brotherhood would be upon the basis
of the lowest and most enslaved workers in the
wide world.
♦
Carruthers the Economist.
Mr. Carruthers, senior member for Canterbury
(N.S.W.), may be a magnificent political genius of
the road and bridge order, but as an apologist for
the Freetrade deity which he worships, he is one
of the most conspicuous failures who was ever
nose-led by Parkes, His reason for opposing
Protection is that as the Belgians can produce
iron manufactures for one-third of the amount of
the cost if produced locally, a protective duty
would be no good unless it were at least 300 per
cent., and therefore he would nob protect at all.
.As he objects to protective imposts because so
high a rate is required, it is a fair thing to con-
clude that he would not object to a moderate duty
say, 10 per cent., which is about the figure that
would satisfy most Protectionists. But setting
that consideration aside, It is strange that while
admitting unrestricted competition with Belgian
workers to be hopeless, he should favour a system
which enforces so distressing a struggle. He
would leave the Australian workers to fight a
battle which he declares to be altogether hope-
less ! The Canterbury electors have reason to be
proud of their six-and-eightpenny patriot. “Go
it, boys ; you’re bound to be knocked out in the
first round,” is his encouragement to the men of
the community who have not the good-luck to be
lawyers protected by every tradition and practice
of the profession. But in one matter we do Mr.
Carruthers an inj ustioe. His remedy for the
disasters of Freetrade is technical education for
our workmen. In effect he asserts that the ignor-
ance of his fellow countrymen is the reason of
their being possessed of that painful hollowness
of pocket and stomach. This assertion, verging
as it does upon the insolent reproach of cow-headed
arrogance, must bo infinitely soothing to the
electors who were so ignorant of his qualifica-
tions as to place him at the head of the poll in
February last And in the light of that fact we
are inclined to regard tho censure as being partly
justified by circumstances. It may be wondered
that The Builetin should devote so much space
to so very dull and small a political personage as
Mr. Carruthers, but high precedent must be
our excuse. King Solomon made the habits of
the ant to point a moral
An Amoozin’ Ouss.
We have already endured the Sydney D.T. on a
good many things. We have had the Telegraph
on art, science, and education ; the Telegraph
on gospel and agriculture; the Telegraph on
political economy ; and the same old dropsical
griffin on po’iticil morality; we have had the
Telegraph on “Humming Bee,” and “Humming
Bee ” on everything except cold pig’s cheek ; and
now we have the Telegraph on Intercolonial
Freetrade. The miserable old King-street bugle
has almost broken its back in times past while at-
tempting to lift along statistics concocted by the
effloe-boy, and facts that nobody but itself ever
heard of ; and still it survives, and comes out
every morning with a smile like a holy hymn and
a new cart-load of garbled bosh perpetrated by
some fresh correspondent, whose one recommen-
dation is that he is stupider and more ar golar
than the Polynesian litterateur of the day before.
The following is a sample of what the D.T’s. latest
kanaka can do when he spreads his naked form
over the paper :
"The protectionist bagmen carry two different sets of poli-
tical ‘s mp’es,' o-e of which tley iurh in town and <1»
olh. rin tee cuan ry. To the city artis »n they are ijstructed


lo otter intercolonial Freetrade with Protection only against
the outside world, while to the country farmer they promul-
gate what is exactly the reverse of this. . . . Either their
town principles or their country principles will ultimately
have to go. . . . As the N.B.W. farmer does not come
into competition with the outside world, Protection of the
sort that is hawked in the city would be to him a dead letter.
What would be the use of a produce duty from which the
goods of Victoria, South Australia, New Zealand, and Tas-
mania— the only places from which we Import produce— were
exempt ? Farmers are not to be mocked in such a trans-
parent fashion as this, and consequently they are always told
that the Protection which is being agitated for is intended to
op -rate against the colonies."
The italics are curs, and in the italicised sentence
the whole argument rests. According to the D.T.
the New South Wales farmer has to face no com-
petition except from the neighbouring colonies,
therefore if he is to be protected at all he must be
protected against his neighbours as well as
against the foreigner, and therefore again the
Protectionist who advocates intercolonial free-
trade is a double-dealer and a liar. This theory is
ably borne out by the statistics of the D.T.’s office
boy, but somehow it does not square very well
with official records. In 1886 nearly half the
bacon and hams imported into New South Wales
came from Britain, the United States, China, and
France. The colony also received barley from
Great Britain, butter in small quantities from
Britain, America, Prance, Germany, Italy, and
India ; cheese from Britain, Germany, and Francs;
eggs from China; farinaceous foods almost en-
tirely from Britain ; flax and hemp mainly from
China; dried fruit in immense quantities from
England ; and grease chiefly from the same
source. More than two-thirds of her foreign
supply of beans was derived from America and
New Caledonia, and two thirds of her maize
imports were also drawn from the French penal
colony. One third of the purchased wheat supply
came from the United States alone at a cost
of more than £70,000 ; nearly half the imports of
hops were drawn from Britain, America, and
Germany, and more than half those of honey
from America alone ; lard was supplied by Britain
in large quantity, and for a multitude of other
articles the Parkes ridden colony was also in-
debted to foreign sources of supply. It is in the
face of these things that the Telegraph's head
ignoramus declares that the New South Wales
farmer has only intercolonial competition to fear.
A uniform system of protection against the
foreigner and freetrade within the boundaries of
Australasia would exclude fully one-third of the
present imports of produce, and yet the D.T. in
the holy calm of its insanity, avers that “ the New
South Wales farmer does not come into competi-
tion with the outer world,” and consequently the
protection which would benefit the city worker
would in his case be utterly useless. If this is
freetrade literature then freetrade literature is a
near relative of Barahbas, or some other ancient
person of the same description, and as for the
Freetrade litterateur, for an unhistorical fashion
of dispensing with the truth he is without a rival.
*
. “Clerical Humourists.”
When Dr. Cameron Lees lectured on “Clerical
Humourists,” the other day, it was a Scotchman
who was speaking. No earnest man of any other
nationality would have gone so gravely into the
subject as he did. He instanced a number of par-
sons who joked— Sydney Smith and the rest—
but forgot that the greatest joke—or joker, shall
we say?—of all was hi mself. We speak of him
now only typically. But, “ Clerical Humourists!”
It is—from" bis point of view—a most unfortunate
title. We have not had time to make these re-
marks before, but we would respectfully draw the
attention of the reverend doctor to the fact that
the Founder of his Faith and most of His apostles
and disciples were no humourists. Paul had a
certain gift for sarcasm which he expiated with
his life. Peter developed his last eccentricity in
being crucified with his head downwards. There
was no money in his pockets ! For some three
hundred years or so afterwards the best of the
Christians were devoured by wild beasts in the
arena, or slaughtered as holocausts. There was no
humour, which we can perceive, in that. After
those days, however, the reign of humour set in.
i Perhaps it was a reaction. Perhaps it was old-
fashioned human nature. Pope Alexander YI.
was an enormous wag. M.Taine is said to havere-
i-marked that a frequent phrase among Englishmen
i is, “Itis a fine day—let us go out and shoot some-
i thing.” In a similar manner (according to a good
imany Italian authorities), Pope Alexander YI.
iused to say, “lois a calm and placid eve—let us
) poison a cardinal.” The estates of the cardinal
. came, of course, to the Pope. He was a mon-
istrous humourist— Alexander Borgia— to sit in
i the “.Fisherman’s Chair.” Cardinal Wolsey was
nalso something of a wag. So also were Richelieu
and Mazabin and Alberoni. All thundering fine
humourists, not to tip the scales too much
one for whom Dr. Cameron
‘xLeeb has such a regard, did not, as far as we have
iread, cut his cloak in 1 alf—So, MARTiN-wise—to
give it to the man who had no cloak. He was too
“ canny,” was John Knox. As far as we know
of (let ns cleanse our lips before speaking of that
beautiful and solemn spirit) Christ was not
“ canny.” The prelates who sit in the House of
Lords at the present time must (if they hare any
sense of humour) chuckle ovc r those old times.
From the Bishop of Scdor and Man to the Arch-
bishop of Canterbury they range from a pittance of
£2OOO lo a modest competency of £25,000 a year.
And yet Dr. Cameron Lees— who in spite of his be-
ing a Scotchman has seme humour - stands gravely
up and talks about Swift, Sterne, Barham,
Sydney Smith, and the rest as “Clerical
Humourists,” We are greatly afraid that he is
an exceedingly droll person himself.
♦
The Colonial Bar.
The colonial Bar is rapidly acquiring proportions
that may fittingly be described as enormous. Yet
It is not plain that quality is keeping pace with
quantity. On the contrary, appearances seem to
favour the theory that, owing to some cause not
easy to discover, few, save mediocre men, suc-
ceed in gaining admission now-a days into the
charmed circ'e of the law. Every now and then
a large batch of young barristers are added to the
rolls, and these remain briefless until some pitying
attorney (drummed up most probably by friends
of tKe briefless) gives one here and there a small
job in court, which is performed as though the
main object was to demonstrate the melancholy
depths of fatuity to which the human mind is
capable of descendirg—with the aid of what is
called a legal training. And it is worthy of note
that while the fellows who do pa : s their exams,
are for the most part rank duffers, not a few men
of superior capacity have from time to time
been plucked. Sir Henry Parkes, for instance,
has made two ineffectual attempts to become a
member of the New South Wales Bar ; and Mr,
T. Garrett, another decidedly clever man (as an
advocate, a pleader, and explainer of the law, so
far as he has had to do with it), has also suffered
a like rebuff. Chief Justice Lilley, of Queens-
land, a lawyer of remarkable abili y, and a meat
commendable Judge except lor his loveof corporal
punishment, never passed an examination for
the Bar at all, but procured an Act of Pdi’lidmbnt
to authorise his wearing a wig and gown. By the
way, Lilley’s penchant for the lash may be due
to the circumstance that in early life he was a
trooper in a cavalry regiment. That the process
of selecting barristers involves the admission of
men below rather than above mediocrity,
and the rejection of really capable and premising
aspirants for the privilege of practising in the
courts, is an inference supported by numerous
cases that might be quoted. No harm accrues
from the admission of inferior men, but a vast
deal of injury is inflicted on individuals and on
the community at large by the non-admission
of superior men. The remedy lies, of
course, in throwing the profession open.
Let the fitness of a practitioner be judged,
not by his ability to pass preliminary exami-
nations, but by the satisfaction he gives his
clients in the discharge of his duties to them. As
a test of intellectual capacity, or even of infor-
mation, examinations are a proved failure all the
world over ; and they are maintained mostly as
part of the system whereby the shallow-pated sons
of wealty and “respectable” people contrive to
monopolise whatever good things are agoing.

Dear Bulletin, —I cannot understand your point
of view in advocating the right of barristers, in
esse and in posse, to “ augment their incomes by
writing for the Press.” The profession of journal-
ism and the profession of law are analogous in
one respect, namely that, speaking broadly,
the members of both are prepared always
to accept briefs on behalf of any cause
which is sufficiently supported with coin.
Barristers and journalists are alike a set
of dexterous manipulators of facts and logic open
for hire to whomsoever pays the best. I have
myself written simultaneously for a Freetrade and
a Protectionist paper, and for a true blue Tory
and a red-hot Radical organ. And we all know
that barristers are ready and willing to fight with
ardour and without scruple in furtherance of any
theory whatsoever—provided the payment is
adequate and sure. But we journalists are not
allowed to poach on the barristers’ preserves.
We are not permitted to speak in a court
of justice on behalf of a client, nor is an attorney
enabled to charge for our opinions. Yet a journa-
list who is not as thoroughly versed in law—
Roman, English common, constitutional, and
statutory—as the average barrister, would hardly
be worth his salt on even the S.M. Herald. And
if journalists are prohibited from putting their
fingers into the pie of barristers, surely it is only
fair that barristers should be under a like dis-
ability as regards competing with journalists. It
is not an easy task for a press-writer to make a
living in Australia under the prevalent system
which throws open the business to the dilettanti
—composed of all sorts and conditions of men,
sucking barristers blocking the way in the rush
for a share of the spoils. The least the legal pro-
fession might do, in return for the privileges they
enioy, I submit, is to leave other profes-
sions alone. And I hold that the Board
of Admission is right in disallowing candi-
dates for entrance into a close borough from
stealing the bread out of the mouths of men who
have graduated in another profession. Unfor-
tunately the “ literary calling,” as James Pavn
calls it, is not like that of coal-lumpers, or brick-
layers, or carpenters and joiners. Journalists
cannot well form themselves into a trades’ union,
and strike if non-unionists are employed. And
here again the professions of law and journalism
are comparable. But the profession of the law is
a trades union nevertheless. Ancient usage and
enactment surround it with bulwarks it never
could erect for itself. It is securely protected at
all points against the competition of outsiders;
and yet it shrieks vehemently for the right to
compete outside its own domain with unprotected
pressmen, and, strangest phenomenon of all, The
Bulletin aids and abets the exorbitant and wholly
unjust demand.— Journalist.
\ The Bulletin has always contended that the privileges
of the barrister’s profession should be abso'utely abolished,
and that anyone having a cause before Court should possess
the tight to nominate any laymen he chose to conduct his
case. The end for which The Bulletin contends, viz , the
throwing open to laymen of the light to practise before the
courts as advocates, would in no measure be advanefd, but
rather retarded, by any stepi taken in the direction of mak-
ing a close corporation of what is now the free 'profession of
journalism. Besides, it will be noted that the j idges do'not
seek to prevent “ admitted” barristers from becoming prefes-
s'onal writers for the Press. All they do is, in the interests
of the existing legal monopoly, to throw every obstacle in the
way of the journalist who seeks to become a barrister

Sydney DT., in a leader advocating that
strenuous efforts should be put forward by the
colony of N.S W. to make a gallant show at the
forthcoming Melbourne Centennial Exhibition,
says
“ We can make a splendid show cf manufa-tures if our
manufacturers will co operate with the com mission and
send samples of th ir best to Melbourne.”
Imported American machinery and imported
English shoddy goods are about all N S.W. can
muster. To talk tf “ our” manufactures is gibber-
ing Sai.a, At the annual N.S.W. Agricultural

mostly in Melbourne), and certain machinery from
Ransome and Sims’ English yard represent every-
thing in that line.

In a recent Sydney Herald there appeared a
curious paragraph stating in a submissive kind of
a way that there were many urgent general
motions on the N.S.W. Supreme Court list which
seemed to have a fair show of remaining there for a
considerable time, and meekly suggesting that a
special day should te set aside for disposing of
these, as the barristers concerned would soon be
going on circuit, and if the hearing should come
on in the absence of these mikados, “the parties
would be forced into the expense of obtaining
fresh counsel.” There is a good old Tory leaning
to the encouragement of public robbery about this
suggestion which must endear it to the class cf
men who read the Herald. The point is that if
the “members of the Bar” (nice phrase, that!),
who have been paid to make these general
motions, go away on circuit and neglect to do the
work for which they have already been paid, other
men will have to ha fee'd to take the place
of the absent! As it is one of the “ Devils Own”
who does this species of law-reporting for ihe
S.M. Herald it is not to be expected that he
would put his finger on the real remedy for such
a state of things. The only wonder is that he
considered that there was anything noteworthy in
this instance of the law's delay. The postpone-
ment of these motions for a fortnight or so would
suit the members of the Bar admirably, for then
one set of practitioners would pocket fees for
doing nothing, and another set of practitioners
would pocket equal fees for doing what the others
ought to have done. Nothing better could be
planned in the interests of the professions ;
suitors might blaspheme at being subjected to
double extortion for the same cause, bat courts
are not run for the benefit of suiton—they a”e
m iuttiiQi d for ihe profit of these whu i r«c ise in
them. The line radical remedy for the present
scandal is to make the barrister’s hire depend
upon his performance of the work for which he is
retained. The rule that obtains outside the
courts should he made to apply within them. Ex-
ample is better than precept. How the intelli-
gent thief must sneer in his heait at the lofty
moral homilies that so glibly and so often fall
from the lips of judges trained and appointed
under a system which connives at the most dis-
graceful plunder ! Bushranging on the stand and
deliver principle is an honourable and manly pro-
fession compared with that of the privileged law-
yer who, after taking his client’s money, robs that
client by neglecting his work in favour of a fatter
brief.

The millennium must be surely approaching, at
least in New South Wales polit’c?. A few months
ago, and apparently, the colony was divided into
two great parties opposed on the principles of
Freetrade and Protection. But it seems after all
that it is only a mutual misunderstanding, and
that their platforms are identical. On the 31st
ult. Mr. Downing, stipendiary lecturer for the
Freetrade League, while referring at Maitland to
the United States, said
" When they considered the production of wealth in the
United States they should not lose sight of these facts: It
was a country .hat sto°d alone : its territory was as vast s s
that of t urope ; it had 60,000.000 of people and a vast home
trade. _ It contained the largest development of Freetrade, for,
ichile it was protected from foreign countries it had inter-
colonial (!) Freetrade."
Now, if this is the largest development of Free-
trade it is exactly what all sensible people
earnestly desire to see in Australia. Intercolonial
Freetrade end Protection from foreign countries I
And how nicely the cap fits us ; Is not Australia
a country standing pre-eminently alone, though
the Freetrade set are doing their best to fasten it
to the apron-strings of Hingland 1 Is its territory
not as vast as all Europe (available land consi-
dered, much larger), ard is not there room, if em-
ployment be made, for twice 60,000,000 of people
and a very vast home trade indeed ?
The Adjutant-General of the British army re-
ceives £2700 per annum against £l6OO and £BOO
paid to the occupants of the same post in the
German and French armies respectively. Count
Yon Mot.tke bosses an army of a million and a
half for £l6OO, while Lord Wolseley receives
£2700 per annum for looking after 100,000 men.
The N.S.W. Commander’s salary and perks
amount to over £lOOO a year. His duties are con-
fined to looking pretty and occasionally reviewing
bodies of volunteers ranging in number from one
man to a score or two. We have a great doubt if
he is worth five sixths of Yon Moi-tke or even
half as much as Wolseley. Come to think of it,
by sacrificing the Commandant and his Assistant-
Adiutant-General, N.S.W. would be able to engage
Von Moltkb without danger to the deficit. We
commend this idea to Dr. Creed, M.L.C,

Great activity prevails in the principal mining
centres of Victoria, the cause being important
discoveries which have been made in quartz-reefs
at Ballarat and Bendigo. At the latter place the
developments in the Great Extended Hustlers
mine, at 1800 and 1900 feet in depth, have in-
spired confidence generally, investors now having
no hesitation in putting their capital into deep
sinking enterprises. A few months ago Extended
Hustler’s shares could be bought in any number at
os. ; now they are quoted at about £5, with plenty
of buj ers and few sellers. The transformation at
the Beehive within a month has been wonderful.
The “sharks” who, during the dull times were
driven below to earn an honest livelihood at drill-
thumping, have again blossomed into unimpeach-
able inexpressibles and the shiniest of shiny hats,

are the curse of both Ballarat and Bendigo.
Messrs Dibbs and Burns are busy j ustnow calling
one another several brands of a political liar, the
point in dispute being whether the arrears of the
New South Wales pastoral rents did or did not
amount to £2,000,000 up to the end of last year.
The funny part of the dispute is that no one can
t ell even now what the arrears really do total, as
the rents of many runs have yet to ha recom-
mended by the local boards, and then increased
and fixed by the wily Garrett. And it is worth
noticing that every extra copper that the latter
imposes is worth threepence to the Treasury
because it is so much extra on to the rents pay-
able on account of ’B5 and 'B6, as well as of ’B7.
This circumstance shows what a master of finance
the fussy and emphatic Burns really is. He
shoves the £2 500,000 deficit of last year forward
to be paid by the next Ministry, and makes a
rousing big surplus out of these pastoral arrears.
He and Garrett are Milbarn-Creek-worthy col-
leagues, but it G. R. Dibbs dees not knock their
little enterprise flatter tban tram-car’d coppers he
will have no right to call himself a politician, let
alone a financier.

Messrs Kurts and Levy, of Kurrajong fame,
have sgain come out uppermost, the prosecution
instituted against them for evasion of the NSW.
Stamp Act having collapsed owing to the Govern-
ment not having proceeded within the time pre-
scribed by the statute. Some six months ago a
correspondent signing himself “J.C.” pointed
out in the columns of The Bulletin that the
pants-making firm and their legal coadjutor were
issuing insufficiently stamped instruments, and
that the Treasury was thereby suffering a serious
loss, but no notice was taken of the warning—
probably for the simple reason that it emanated
from The Bulletin. As the result Attorney-
General Wise has stultified himself by starting a
prosecution which any sucking barrister could
have told him must necessarily be futile, and
Kurrajongism is again triumphant, as swindles, if
conducted on a sufficiently extensive scale, gener-
ally are in New South Wales.

The British Asscelation - the bodygof fossils whom
Sir Patrick Jenkins wished to invite here to get
an authoritative opinion as to the antiquity of the
Bondi sewer and the killing power to the square
inch of its stinks —have bean indulging in a tele-
scopic view of Australia, and they have startled
the world by discovering that the Protectionist
policy of Victoria has been detrimental to the in-
terests of that colony, while it has been beneficial
to New South Wales. How grateful New South
Wales ought to be to her neighbour for such a
magnanimous display of generosity! How is New
South Wales to atone for her past declamations
against the alleged selfishness of Victoria? It
will be interesting to learn on what alleged facts
the Association bases this assumption. We know
that Victoria’s policy has been beneficial to the
colliery proprietors and coal miners of New South
Wales, but we cannot get the “hang” of the logic
vluh attempts to demonstrate that the people of
Victoria hav~ not gained a larger benefit). Tne
report of the New South Wales Mines Depart-
ment for 1886—issued with the customary
promptitude last month—shows that if it had not
been for the requirements of the Victorian manu-
facturers the New South Wales coalminers would
have had a very bad time of .it last year. The
output of coal was bonsiderably less in i 886 thah
it was in 1885. There was decreased local con-
sumption notwithstanding that, according to the
mighty Pulsfobd, there was a marked increase
in manufacturing industries. The only division
of the return which showed an increase was the
export to Victoria, where, if we are to believe
Pulsford, manufacturing industries are on the
decline. If that gentleman’s statement are cor-
rect, the Economic Association which has recently
been established in Sydney have a novel problem
to solve. They will have to explain why it is
that as manufactures increase the consumption of
coal decreases, and vice versa.

The London Trades’ Union Congress has emphatic -
ally declared itself an idiot by prescribing the
eight hours’ system as a cure for the want of
employment prevailing in England. If that
system were introduced English workmen would
be simply nowhere in the competition with Conti-
nental labour. Foreign competition is the two ends
and the middle of the present trade depression in
the United Kingdom, and only by lengthening the
hours of labour, lowering wages, or imposing pro-
tective duties can the depression be removed.
Shortening the working day, or increasing wages,
is only playing into the hands of Belgians,
Germans, Frenchmen, and Chinese—not to men-
tion Hindoos. Under the present regime,
Be’gian ironwork can be tent to any part
of England cheaper than it can be made cn
the spot; where then would the eight hour
Britisher be if this Trades’ Union scheme were
carried out? Short hours and a Freetrade tariff
are more antagonistic to one another than Abigail
and orthography, or Freetrade pamphlets and the
Eternal Truth,
To the Australian Press.
(FOR FAVOUR OF THE BULLETIN.)
The fact of an editor not being held liable for the
opinions entertained by his correspondents prompts
me to solicit space to enlarge upon a matter con-
cerning which you and I hold different views, an d
as the Australian press is nearly unanimous upon
this question I address it as a body.
When England’s brightest essayist and bio*
grapher would start to write of an historical
epoch, it was his practice to pick out a contem-
poraneous character, and use him as a centre
round which to weave one of those magnificent
political literary dramas, embracing many concur-
rent events, and intertwined with that ancient
lore and simile of which he was so great a -master.
Taking a hint from so skilful a practitioner, I
will select a paragraph from “ Votes in Parlia-
ment" in the Sydney D.T., round which I will
wrap my arguments. Do not imagine that I take
this paragraph because it is weaker than the
articles upon the same subject in the other papers,
for it is immeasurably superior in every respect
to a recent leader and sub-leader in another daily,
and is written by one who certainly writes far
better than most of what appears in either the
D.T. or any other N.S.W. journal.
The D.T. writer quotes the following from him
whom he describes as “a popular writer : ” —“ The
place where woman can work with the best effect
to influence the laws of the country is in her
home.” Now, unless woman be refined and edu-
cated by the highest curriculum that each indi-
vidual can stand, and her body developed by good
wholesome exercise, what sort of a creature
should we have “to influence the laws of the
country ? ” That such training is woman’s right
as much as man’s has, after centuries of degrada-
tion, been admitted, and that she is capable of
successfully receiving it, can be demonstrated in
the writer’s family and friends.
My mother was a brilliant musician, cultivated
linguist, and well-read scholar. She was a good
cook, could wash and iron, and was as refined a
lady as any now alive anywhere. Can you show
me a man that can match that 2 Can any of you
gentlemen of the Press stand up and honestly say,
“ Sex notwithstanding, I am that woman’s equal 2 ’
But I have not nearly finished. My father is said
to have been a clever man. Ido not remember
him, but he had the typical clever man’s failing :
by intemperance he squandered his own and my
mother’s fortune. Nevertheless, she, by her own
exertions, reared me respectably, furnished me
with a profession, and died, leaving me a couple
of thousand pounds which she had earned. Equal
her with a man upon the Sydney Press if you can,
and then peruse the following : —She was a very
beautiful woman, both in face and figure. I well
remember the excellent proportions of her- form,
and the sweetly amiable and intellectual expres-
sion of her face. My knowledge of phrenology
was gained when a boy by comparing the ap-
parent defects in the heads of acquaintances with
the smooth, well-balanced “caput” which, with
so much dignity, rested above her shoulders.
I was once seated upon a ’bus when the driver
called my attention to some people approaching
by exclaiming, “There is a duchess for you, she
looks fit to be queen of any country.” It was my
mother to whom he referred, and she was then 60
years old. Picture in your mind’s eye the ordinary
voter at 60 years old! But she was not fit to
vote. Then, gentlemen, I ask : “Why are you 2”
And yet you know that there is not one man in
ten thousand who is the equal of the woman I
have described, and many a Sydney citizen will go
further in her praise than I have dared to do. .
My wife, though an out-and-out lively and gay
American society woman, is a college graduate,
and holds a diploma for music. Her cousin
(female, as the French school-books say) is one of
the leading teachers of music in New York —none
of your guinea-a-quarter kind, but makes £l5OO
per annum. My male cousin is engaged to be
married to an accomplished lady who took a B.A.
at 19 years old He is a semi-clownish dunce, but
has a vote ; she is said to be lively, and certainly
learned —as much his superior as she is that of
most of Australian pressmen, but she is too in-
competent (2) even to have a voice as to how she
shall be governed. My cousin (female) has a B.A.
and is “going for ” an M A., but is too incompe-
tent (save the mark!) to vote as to whether a
vu'gar person like or or —— shall out-
rage decency in Parliament, or Abigail shall bur-
lesque political jurisprudence and mineralogy, to
say nothing about etymology. I was married
from the house of a lady physician, about one of
whose lectures even one of the Sydney daily
papers lately devoted three-quarters of a column
in praise, the laudatory article being from the pen
of the principal of one of the local hospitals.
The wife of a friend of mine journeys annually
to a foreign country to purchase thousands of
pounds’ worth of merchandise for her husband,
who himself a sp l endid business man, but he
says that she is the best buyer he ever met. Yet
she is not fit to vote. Then, gentleman I again


ask, “ Why ar eyou?” I and my wife between
na have female relatives and friends ad lib, who
are high up in the artistic and literary world.
Her own private correspondence is so much valued
by her friends in America that her letters are
handed round somewhat like the volumes of a cir-
culating library among families of whom she has
never heard, but who eagerly seek her M.S. They
are so good that they would be disgraced by even
appearing side by side witji the rubbish with
which we in Sydney have to put with up in our
journals.
By last mail 1 received a letter from my aunt,
who therein states that she is 87 years old. hut
very feeble,, and therefore cannot write as “of
yore.” Yet of this same letter Ido not think that
Pliny himself would have been ashamed, and at
87 years 1 will “ back ” her to write a page of cor-
respondence matter better than your whole staff
put together.
Pray make no mistakes about anything I lay
down as fact. lam prepared to prove all that I
say. But lam digressing, so “let us return to
our muttons.” I was endeavouring to show what
a poverty-stricken piece of mentality a usual man
is compared with even the female members of my
family. But you pressmen of Australia
are so damnably ignorant that you look upon
others as fools, and you set down women, in
whose society you could not remain for half
an hour without showing your inferiority, as
something entirely beneath you. Woman
has proved herself man’s equal in nearly every
walk of life in which man has shown excellence,
and yet the D.T. writer says; “ They can attain
their political aims if they have any . . . more con-
genially by moulding ihe minds of the men.”
More congenially to whom? To the men or to
themselves ? But in either case what an asser-
tion ! A being who, as he shows farther on, is
unfit to discriminate, and is inferior to man, is to
mould her superior ! Then, farther : “As a mat-
ter of fact, it has to be admitted that few women
have any political aims.” He, like the rest ol
you, appears to be a man of some educktion, hut
with what a peculiar class of women must you all
mix ? Granting his false statement to be true, how
many boys are there who “ have any political
aims” until they have a voting-ticket thrust into
their hands ? And what sort of “ political aims”
have a very large percentage of voters ? But cer-
tainly the half educated creatures Australian
women usually are, are just what our friend sajs,
aimless—because the quarter-educated, half-
developed ordinary male voter, frequent M.P., and
usual pressman, have all the say. Do you judge
of women by the ladies who get paid to scribble for
papers ?
Listen a moment. Citizen upon omnibus :
“ Women are a blanked crimson nuisance and at
the bottom of all trouble. Let them vote ! I should
think net, indeed.” Second citizen : “ I believe in
woman being kept in their place.” The writer
enquired, if he meant a harem. “No ! ” “ Where
then?” “Mind the children,” was the reply.
Now that is, many people consider, woman’s
proper place. But a being who has “no political
aim?,” and knows little else, is the last person
who should have the management of children.
Our friend then speaks of her “ outvoting the
men,” and then completely upsets himself by say-
ing that “ the majority of them would never
avail themselves of the franchise.” The quotee
must surely he an Irishman “ Every man,” he
say?, “ is what some woman chooses to make
him.” Granting this, and that she had a voice in
affairs, she would quickly sweep away the bar-
baric surroundings which he declares appertain to
a ballet-box. But “my little friend, Grildrig,
yen have written a most admirable panegyric
upon your country” in pointing out that the over-
running - with - political - aims - male -free • and-inde-
pendent should, when exercising his noble prero-
gative, act so like a wild beast that woman’s
purity would he contaminated by her presence,
and would not upon this account, as lie says, face
the polling-booth. Woman is so much above him
or below him that “ the place where she can
work with the best effect to influence the laws of
the country is in her home.” Take which horn
you like, and if above him, let him stop at home
whilst she goes out to vote ; if below such an
animal, of what use is her influence ?
There are thousands of thoroughbred Austra-
lian women who, had they the chance, would
develope into a power which would materially
assist in making this the brightest spot upon the
surface of the globe, as it certainly is the most
favoured.—l am, gentlemen, yours,

The Bulli Fund.
The always unfortunate Sydney D.T. has placed
1 .self in the peculiar! y miserable position of advo-
cate of the Bulli committee. There was a wrong
side to he taken, and, of course, the D.T. took it
like the wobbling, flopping, web footed bird that
only knows how to cackle, and will starve for days
with a troughfull of mashed corn right beside it.
The D.T. supports the plan of distribution adopted
by the Bulli committee because it is based on the
plan adopted in the case of the Creswick calamity.
Yet in the course of his arguments the D.T.
writer shows that the two plana are radically dis-
similar. The fund raised in connection with the
Creawick catastrophe was used as a Mining Acci-
dent Relief Fund, and was raised from the fir. 1, for
the purposes disclosed by the title. The widows
and orphans of the men suffocated in
the Creswick mine were to enjoy merely
a life-interest in the Fund. They were to receive
weekly payments out of the interest yielded by
the invested moneys. And with what result?
The widows got 15s. per week—that is £39 pei
annum; and the capital remains for the relief of
sufferers through mining casualties for all time.
The Bulli plan is wholly different. The widows
are to get £3O per annum, and the capital fund is
to vanLh simultaneously with the death of the
last widow or the exhaustion of claimants other-
wise. The geniuses to whom the D.T. accords its
sympathy and support are really going to give the
Bulli widows £9 a year less than the Creswick
widows get, and yet not leave a penny behind !
Surely even the D TVs perceptive facul-
ties ought not to be unequal to the
tssk of figuring out something rotten here.
Ncr is this the worst. At the meet-
ing of the Executive Committee on Monday
it was affirmed that members of that body and of
the local committee at Bulli had impressed upon
the widows the expediency of abandoning their
legal claims under the Employers’ Liability Act
against the colliery proprietors, the alternative
suggested being nothing short of losing all chance
of participating in the benefits of the Fund ; and
the widows present testified to the truth of this
serious allegation ! Nevertheless there is no
need for surprise at the action of the D.T. That
print seem now to be smile solely on the interests
of capitalists, land-jobbers, and calicc-jimmies. It
would have been matter for astonishmenr, if it
had ventured to defend the case of a lot of poor
and uninfluential widows and orphans.

terms expressly stated that only the imported
article was wanted, and no local producer need
apply. As it happened, however, the imported
article was not forthcoming. The Calico Jemmies
who put Parkes in, and who will also turn him
out when he ceases to do their bidding, don’t im-
port road metal; and when it was found that the
required material could not be conveniently ob-
tained from Victoria it was resolved to give

The Referee
Brilliant weather and attendance at the
opening (Derby) day of the A.J.C. Spring meet-
ing. Nothing but Ahercorn was considered to
have a show for the Derby, for which event he
started at 5 to 2 on, and, taking command when
entering the straight, he won in a canter from
Niagara, in 2min. 39|iec. ; Australian Peer finish-
ing a length away third. Ellerslie won the Hurdle
Race from Inv.’ctus ; and the Hon. James White
scored a second win with Carlyon in the Trial
Stakes, The Charmer and Lady Yattendon running
second and third. Another favourite, Phaon, ap-
propriated the Epsom Handicap ftom Dividend ;
and Victory, the only outside winner of the day,
annexed the Welter Handicap from Kingswood.
Trident started at 3 to 1 on for the Spring Stakes,
and won in the simplest canter from Dunlop,
Honeydew running into a place.

The great Metropolitan Stakes at Rand-
wick was won by Mr. Chambers’ Cardigan, which
beat Acolyte by a head after a great race.
Upper-cut came in third, and Phaon, the favourite,
was nowhere in particular. The field num-
bered fourteen in all. Chester led at the
start, but soon gave place to Frisco, who
held his grouad till near the sland, when the
heavily-backed Dunlop got ahead. Acolyte and
Cardigan were then nearly in the tail of the pro-
cession, h at at the back of the band they came up
with a rush, just as Frisco regained the lead, and
settled the question bet ween themselves.

however, was suddenly polished off by a right-

ardthe slow but powerful Gorman ended in a
draw after 24 rounds, though M’Carthy ought on
public form to have made a chopping-block of his

A little circumstance transpired at Rand-
wick, the other day, which once more illustrates
the saying that the way of transgressors is rough
on rats. A big bookmaker was driving a cash
trade cn the course, and as his clerk booked the
bets a dodgy little man stood behind him on one
leg and cooled them down in his note book. The
bookmaker saw him, but he said nothing. He
only smiled, but the little dodgy man will never
again come within 10 miles of that smile if he can
help it. When the first race was run he looked at
his notes and found that “ R P." was entitled to
£l5. He rushed up and demanded the money.
“ Wot’s the name?” said the layer of ye odds,
with an aspect of Methodist calm. “ R.P.,” was
the reply. “ Then there’s P.R, for you instead I”
and there was a sound like a planet concussing
against the solid earth, and the little man found
himself lying cn the turf with one ear spread all
over his face and something very loose about Ms
teeth. He felt as if he wanted to lie still for a
month, but just then the real R.P. came up, and
he had to rise and fly lest the backer should have
a call to hit him on the other ear.

1 a month ago. “ Mug ” Benzon recently offered
to back his horse, Carrasco, against Kilwarline,
himself to ride Carrasco and Lord Marcus Beres-
ford upon the other. From which we infer that
Benzon didn't win a fortune over the Leger.

some evil-dlsposei person or persons, with malice

Gracious went and let the hares loose. This
should teach the Temora people that tying up
hares Is no way of securing them. The right thing
to do is to hobble them with chain cables, and
side-line them with hawsers. Coursing is rare
sport after the hares have been kept this way in a
hutch for a month or two.

Poor Joe Duffett, better known as “ J. G.
Reid,” committed suicide at Dandenong (Vic.),
last week. Since Grace Darling won the memor-
able Caulfield Cup of 1885, Mr. “Reid"has not
had a very good time on the turf, and what with
chronic neuralgia and backing losers, his rash act
is partly understandable. To the last poor Joe
kept a stiff lip under his troubles. At 8 o’clock
on Friday morning he fortified himself with a
final lemonade and brandy, and strolled out with
his gun “to have a shot at something before
breakfast.” Calmly and deliberately he shot
“something” through the lungs, and died in a
few hours.
A stupid mistake was made by those who
asked the Mayor of Sydney for the use of Belmore
Park fora meeting to promote the protection of local
industry. Had they told his Worship they wanted
the place for the purpose of invoking the Divine
protection for the Guelph lot, they would have got
it without a moment’s delay, and Mayor Riley
would gladly volunteer to tell them all about his
attachment to the throne and person.
Sydney D.T. is now of opinion that the
“ glorious f reefrade victory," which it wrote so
exultingly about a few months since, was a mere
Action. Several times lately it has told its readers
that “ the first issue before the country at the late
elections was the re-establishment of pure govern-
ment.” In the next sentence of the latest article
in which this statement is made the D.T. compli-
ments the electors of N.S.W. on their efforts in
this direction by slying ; “In forming his present
cabinet Sir Henry Parkes unfortunately made
seme selections which justify an extra degree of
vigilance over administration.” We never before
saw the eternal truth put so gently.
The Honourable Within-the-Colony G. A,
Lloyd, who seams to have been terribly cut up by
the mendacious statement male in The Artos to
the effect that he was an uncertiflcated insolvent,
has the complete sympathy of the community in
the matter of the cowardly and unfounded at-
tack made upon his reputation. Such mali-
cious statements, though they might be
treated with silent, contempt by men devoid
of sensitiveness who had been uncertiAoatedly in-
solvent, are calculated to be of in Anil e annoyance
to an upright citizen like Mr. Lloyd, the fact
of whose successful application for a bank-
ruptcy certificate is perfectly well-known to
everyone who moves in religious circles or who
has long been connected with commerce in Sydney.
Jeames Munro, M.L.A. of Melbourne,
who hails from Aberdeen, awa, and is the head
and front of Victorian toetotalism, says he disnaj
approve o' the pur-r-rchase o’ the telephone'
which he regards as a weecked inatr-r rument,
and he is surprised that the Government o’ a
Chreestian country should have undertaken to
work such a contrivance. It seems that not very
long ago Mr. Munro was sitting in his bank
counting up the money, when he was rung up by
someone in mistake for another Munro, and told
to send along another ten casks of brandy and be
dashed all the way to whataisname and back
again. This was such a shook that Mr. Munro
could only fall hack against the wall and murmur
feebly “ Losh I” When he recovered, however, he
stated that he was sur-r-rprised to find the tele-
phone used as the meejum for orderin’ whusky,
and that, conseedarin’ the thing had learned to use
language that was contrary to the teachings of the
Screeptures he would have it removed at once
from his office. And, in addition to that, he has
declared war against the telephone wherever he
meets it, and the conduct of the Postmaster-
General in purchasing the Telephone Company’s
business on behalf of the Government has lowered
that gentleman so much in his estimation that he
wou'dn’t be surprised now to hear him whustlin’
on the Sawbath.
The N.S.W. Parliamentary bear-garden
lias opened again, and Parkes’ promised property-
tax is not on the list. There is to be a bill for
making the land muddle worse than before, a de-
centralisation bill, a bill to enable Habigle to ran
after the rabbit with greater celerity, a hill to
prevent railways being made only where in-
fluential men have property, and to prohibit the
purchase of any more wharves which the country
doesn't want at three times what they would be
worth to someone who wanted them badly, an in-1
solvency measure which will not affect the numer-
ous politicians who have made their piles through
“ the court,” a bill to provide for giving less mem-
bers to constituencies, another for the establish-
ment of model farms which will be supplied
with Government live stock, and where ?
Government professors at high salaries will give
lectures on milking the horse under a mistaken
idea that he is a cow, and a comprehensive mea-
sure which will authorise the finances to perspire.
Also there is to be a military reorganisation, and
steps are to be taken to enable Burns to collar
Dibbs’ land-rent arrears and pass them off as cur-
rent revenue obtained by his own sagacity instead
of applying them to cover the deficit. Bat the
property tax, on the strength of which Parkes got
into power, is nowhere on the list. Calico Jemmy-
dom takes care of that.


SUNDRY SHOWS.
Thbatbje Royal—" Human Nature”.. p. 15
Ciutbbion Thbatee.—" Romeo and Juliet”....
Exhibition Building.— Roller Skatinn Rink ...... „
Her Majekty's Theatre.—” Henry V."
Aquarium and I’Ll! a sure Gkoub ds.— Bondi p 1.
The “ wessel ” who writes these shows
wishes to utter a word of explanation. He has
learned of late through various indirect channels
that he is not so popular in certain quarters as he
could desire—that one manager wishes to tear him
apart, and that another would like to take his
head outside and throw mud at. it ; and a gentle-
man cf the acting persuasion recently called and
demanded damages for an 18-months old libel,
and then took him out to have a drink, with the
result that he was caught in a sudden shower and
got wet outside. Tnis sort of thing is undermining
his constitution, and it imparts a feeling of inse
curity to his profession which makes it impossible
for the roses of eloquence to come to full bloom on
his soul. He has resolved in future, therefore, to
pursue his avocation of dramatic critic in company
with his mother-in-law. The manager who would
hit a man when he has his mother-in-law along with
him is no gentleman, and his show will ever after-
wards be treated with silent contempt, and as the
lady is of a strictly peaceful disposition, it is
hoped that her presence will serve to allay any
friction that might otherwise arise. Bad language
addressed to the critic will in future be regarded
as levelled at his mother-in-law, and will be dealt
with accordingly.

That hunky kid, Mr, George Rignold,
proposes to run “Henry V.” indefinitely at Her
Majesty’s, and his troops will hurrah till they
burst. As regards the King himself, we sketched
what he called his character last week, and we
have nothing to add, except that his father had
boils on his face and suffered from fits. Henry V.
was a very regular man, as far as we can judge
from the drama, and always spent his mornings in
finding out conspiracies against his crown, and
his afternoons in standing up dressed in a boiler-
plate suit pointing his sword at a shabby little town
and yelling to his soldiers to come on. When he
wasn’t doing this he was generally fighting a man
two feet smaller than himself at the back of the
kangaroo-cage. Henry swells up to such an
extent on the stage that six harrowloads
of minor characters are almost invisible, but
among those who survive are Mr. Bailey, who
makes the shirty little Fluellen an object of in-
terest, and Mr. Sweeney, who generally brings
down the house as Captain Mac Morris. Also Miss
Athena Claudius, as the Princess Katherine, re-
fuses to be wiped out, and does her little part in
a style which shows that she is going to be a
general favourite some day ; and Mr. C. Holloway
also does his share to prevent Henry Y. degenera-
ting into a staring butcher’s advertisement. Her
Majesty’s fills well every night, and the audience
are generally pretty sober and manifest no desire
to throw a centipede into the hind legs of the
company,

Nature ” before it dies had therefore better hurry
up, for that drama has got its bleared and blood-
shot eye fixed on the grave, and there is going to

Egyptians, niggers, and Soudanese will conse-
quently be for sale cheap.

The general air of sorrow and sadness
which pervades a place that a corpse is staying at
is becoming strongly marked at Sydney Academy,
where Professor Pepper’s ghost drags its spectral
form across the wilderness of time, and scuds
through the dusty caves of solemncholy which
gape with cavernous jaws above the yellow tide
of the sea of life. Amid the twilight of the
charnel-house the ghost rakes up a dust with its
bony, flesbless feet, and plays merry tunes on its
bleached ribs, while it vainly endeavours to shake
out the gravel which has drifted through its eye-
sockets into its head, and which weighs down
that top-heavy member like a meal of hash.
The Professor’s spectre would make a goed tomb-
stone if anything sufficiently dreary could be
engraved on it; failing that, it had better have its
legs knocked from under it with a stick, and then
it should he put to rest for ever between the damp
sheets of a Sydney boarding-house.

The merry, jovial minstrels at Sydney

“The Great Drum Performer of the Universe,”
but apparently the patrons of the Alhambra are
still as enthusiastic about School as they were the
first day he appeared. School is preceded by 10
songs of which nine are well worth hearing, and
as the man who sings the other one looks as if he
were of a blooodthirsty turn of mind we won’t
criticise him by name, nothavirg any desire to be
butchered to make a darkey’s picnic The songs
and the farce which come after Suhoot are equally
attractive, and Miss Florence Schuler in particular
—we abandon the throes of comi ositicn at this
point to look at a horse which has gone down with
a cart-load of meat in front of the office window,

Miss Kate Alma is fast becoming a uni-

at Sydney Criterion. Her songs are all well
chosen, and she sings them in a fashion that is at
once charming and irresistible. The Criterion
concerts now draw the largest Sunday night
audiences in Sydney.
Ever since “Jack Sheppard ” first opened
in Melbourne, that city has been taken bad with
“ Ri-tooral, ri-tooral, ri-addy-de.” Everybody
has it from the Chief Justice downwards. The
high-church parson has been struck with it, and
intones the cervices to a tune that ends with
ri-addy-de; the Salvation Army bang it out on
the big drum, and the -Argus man writes his
leaders to the accursed jirgle. Domestic differ-
ences have arisen owing to ri-toora), and seven
divorce oases are pending ; homes that were once
happy and peaceful have been broken up, and
golden-haired girl-wives have gone home to their
mothers, while many a formerly loving and de-
voted husband toorals amid the ruins of his
domestic bliss, and tries vainly to drown the
chorus in drink. The defeat of the Opposition in
the recent no-confidence debate is set down to
tooral, a number of the party having got it so bad
that they could not appear in public ; and in one
way and another the foundations of society a r e
broken up. But though the law is powerless, the
citizens are awake to the danger, and when an
organ-grinder started to disseminate “ re-tooral,
re-tooral, ri-addy-de” his blood was upon his own
head and his brains were on the pavement. He
died as a warning to other sinners, and when he
was dead, the organ which he had trained to aid in
spreading the fiendish tune was knocked in with
a sledge-hammer, and the monkey that accom-
panied the turn-out was thrown over a house,

“ Held by the Enemy” is improving as it

rough edges have been worn down, but not with-
out considerable friction. On Saturday Miss

That tuneful overture concluded we now go on to
mention that “ Mixed” is fetching them as usual
at Melbourne Ojera House Apart from Mr. Phil

ing to the comrdy, and a lot of people are en-
deavouring to give it a touch of Nature this

A hitch in B. and B’s domestic arrangements
prevented them from producing their “ Beetler,”

‘‘Our Buys ” with Blueskln Royce as the ever-
lasting butterman. Meantime the Italian Opera
is thriving ail the while at the Royal ; and
“ Dorothy” keeps the Princess's warm enough.

cence. Mis Braham and the other new talent—

A company which recently appeared at
Perth (W.A.) can boast of having broken the
record. When they commenced playing the
audience went out in a body and demanded the
return of their money, and not a soul stayed to
see the performance out. The “ Champion
Banjo Player " started the stampede.
There is a trivial difference of opinion be-
tween the two leading Melbourne papers as to the
merits of “ Held by the Enemy,” the new play at
the Bijou Theatre. The Age gushes : —“ ‘ Held
by the Enemy ’ is a thoroughly good play, abound-
ing in striking effects, full of interest, vigorous in
action, healthy in tone, and not devoid of
humour.’ Ihe Argus croaks:—“lt appears to
us to be about as loosely-jointed and incoherent a
piece of dramatic workmanship as has been often
put together."
At Adelaide Royal “A Run of Luck”
has been withdrawn in favour of “ Alone in Lon-
don," winch seems hardly likely to have such a
run of luck as its predecessor. Mr. Locke

together a large concourse of bald-headed citizens.

turbs the calm of the city of holy snuttle is Tommy

it “ Humpybong ” in Brisbane, and ‘ Goat Island ’
in Sydney, but that is a mere detail. Carrie
Swain is now taking the Queensland capital by the
wool with “ The Miner’s Daughter,” and as a new
and gorgeous establishment called “Her Majesty’s
Opera House" is to open at Christmas, it is evi-
dent that a once dreary city is going in for joy.
“Her Maiesty’a Opera House,” by the way, is a
sad misnomer. Her Majesty doesn’t care for
opera ; when she isn’t bathed in grief she looks in
on Buffalo Bill's shcrw, or has a glance at a
menagerie.

the memory of the “ nob-

G. V. Brooke, who went
down in the Eteamshlp

have said that “ so far as
originating and develop-

no more entitled to the authorship than he is to

in the comedy to the only Dion, who coolly
assumed the authorship of it also.

A good many old chum no doubt cherish
tender memories of Miss Heath, an actress con-

recently at the age of 50. Miss Heath was con-

was certainly powerful in emotional characters.
The present generation had a taste of her quality
when she “ created ’’ the heroine in Wills’ “ Jane
Shore.” Before the Queen became pre-eminent in

circle. She was the wife of Wilson Barrett, one

was personal, it was egotistic. It contained a full catalogue

looked uncomfortable while the stream of unconscious 1?] but
offensive egotism meandered calmly on. No wonder that
his Excellency wore the air ef a man who wished ho was far

left the hall in unconcealed disgust before the long oration
finished, and that others relieved themselves by a similar re-
tirement from the scene. There were many present prepared
to do honour to the guest of the evening, but they were not
prepared to say to Sir Henry or his admirers, except with the

hair as thin as the heard of a Mongolian high

deaf mutes, and the trouble arose out of a neigh-
bour’s quarrel. Mary Ann slapped Johanna’s
baby, and Johanna, of course, could not retaliate
in the good old-fashioned way by poking her nose
t hrough a hole in the fence and calling her dear
friend Mrs. Moore flat-footed, lark heeled, and
ugly, a bold, brazen hussey, and a trollop to boot;
and for obvious reasons Mary Ann could not reply
to the other s scornful glances by climbing on to
an inverted wash-tuo and delivering a shrill
diatribe with special reference to a floor “as
wasn’t scrubbed from one month’s end to
another,” It was a cruelly trying position for two
women to be placed in. They couldn t stand and

joined in legislation adverse to the Chinese, it had
not been from any low estimate of the Chinese
charaoter, or from any sympathy with those who
had attempted to attribute to that race faults of
character which he did not believe they could he
fairly accused of. But it had been from a desire
to preserve the British type in all these Australian

The lay of the last bootmaker comes from
Gisborne (N. Z.). He is going home to his mother,
and this is what he has to say before he tears him-
self from his customers : —
IN BANKRUPTCY
(Nearly),
IN THE SUPERIOR BOOT SHOP OF GISBORNE.
In Ibe matter of the number of Bankruptcies now existing,
and the eeveral additions to come.
NOTICE is hereby given that!, ARTHUR JOHN COOPER,
of Gisborne, Bootmaker, have this day tiled an appeal
to my customers that I am willing to sacrifice my Large and
Vari( d Stock of Boots and Shoes for the purpose of clearing
out of “ Bankruptcy Bay." This is a genuine notification,
and no reasonable otter will be refused, as I intend to retire
at a very early date. A joke is a joke, but Gisborne people
are carrying it too far, s > buy me out, and let me “ get." To
work hard for the public, and then to be “ had” in return is
not good enough.
, Bated this 29th day of July, 1887.
Poor devil 1 Gisborne is one of the many places
we have been stranded in, and we pity him. We
arrived there by coach, one night long ago, in
company with a bony American female in striped
stockings, who was going about lesturing to prove
that nothing had ever happened, and, moreover,
that it didn't matter a cent if it had; and we
spent the evening in listening to an eloquent ad-
dress, in the course of which she drank six glasses
of water, and flogged the desk with her note
book, and proved beyond a doubt that there never
was anything or anybody, or anywhere to put it,
and that nobody cared about it anyhow, and that
she would see it hanged first. That was a good
many years ago, but Gisborne has never really
looked up since.

According to a Sheffield paper, a microbe
which feeds on railway iron and consumes rolling-
stock is the latest scientific discovery in Europe.
This insect is almost, if not quite, invisible to the
naked eye, hut the German scientist who has been
keeping his eye on him reports that he can eat
81lb. of steel rail in a fortnight, and consequently
when he starts to graze on a loop line it may as
well be given up for lost Judging from the little
that is known of his habits, it would appear that
he seldom eats locomotives and boilers until he
'has finished the permanent way, but when pressed
by hunger he will gradually chew up a whole
engine shop. He seems to prefer railway to tram-
way, but still a bit of iron girder is not altogether
out of his line, and he can digest sidings and other
sundries. The German scientist who discovered
this greedy brute as he was going home at an
early hour in the morning has named it the
‘ railoverous.” Probably farther investigation
will reveal the fact that the animal only consumes
direct lines, and that he can be outwitted by tak-
ing the railway round by the property of an in-
fluential member of Parliament. In that case a
good many N.S.W. lines are tolerably safe.

A short time ago Mr. S. Y. Winter, one
of the proprietors of the Melbourne Herald,
gave a supper on a terrific corned-beef scale to
his staff. The staff, in a frenzy cf enthusiasm—or
surprise—gave him a return “bankit.” Mr.
Winter iur.de a speech on the occasion, in which
he referred in terms of affection—which brought
the unbidden tear to many a cohwebbed eye—to
the undivided love he had for his staff, and the
undivided love the staff had for him, He said,
furthermore, that “without any desire to talk
shop he thought he might venture to tell them
that the circulation of the Herald had that day
again te?n ov« r 70,000.” The conclusion of hia
speech was smothered in sobs of joy from the re-
porters and machine-oilers. What did they care
—great and disinterested hearts—for such possi-
bilities as milkmen depositing a half-pint with the
remark that they would “ leave no more till the
last was paid for,” or landlords threatening to put
the bailiff in on Monday ? Nothing. They swam |
in the glory and the beer of the time
and were gorgeouslv happy. We have not yet
bean informed that Mr. Winter proposes to give a
surprise present to to the members of his staff on
the strength of this enormous circulation, but we
suppose he is keeping his munificent intentions |
dark. It is an amiable weakness of gifted and
generous souls. We should not wonder if, during
the next week, Lifctia Collins-street were ablaze
with half crowns. We should not wonder much—
if it were not. We think, however, that—giving
the credit where the credit is due—Mr. Winter
should offer a prize (say a silver-mounted coffin,
lined with copies of the Herald) for the most
senrati mal suicide or sensational murder every
six months. It would, no doubt, be an encourage-
ment !

and has departed many times in the Argus. Oa
a large number of occasions, likewise, he has
absquatulated in the Age, and the Evening
Herald has put forth several seme of soulful
wails in several hundreds of editions concerning
his sudden and mysterious scarceness. He has
sloped in the Echo, and the Sydne t Mail men-
tions three times in one issue that he has cleared.
And as if this wasn’t enough the Jeknil points
out in impassioned language that he isn’t there
any more, and the Tribune demands to know
“ Where is he ? ” Australia is beginning to get
rather sick of this low-priced Afghan at last, and
if the Jernil will only publish an article now
stating that nobody cares a cent, where the dooce
Ayoub Khan has got to, and that it doesn't believe
there ever was any such a person, it will do a good
turn to the community.

If A. J. Ivitney, of no place in particular,
Queensland, professor of things in general, dees
not shortly enter Parliament we will be more than
surprised. When last heard of he was raining
verbal cats and dogs at Normanton on the Gulf,
that region of snakes, alligators, flies, him ruin
and purgatory. During the proceedings at an ex-
cited meeting, Mr. Ivimey’s political opponent
came on the platform and endeavoured to si:
down on a chair where no chair was; emse-
quently hi fell with a great and awful thwaoir,
and was heard no more till near the close of the
show. The candidate afterwards wrote to the
local paper about “a hairy hyena, recently out of
a bullock dray,” who had been promoted to an
editorship, and it is presume! that this poor
smitten individual was the person aimed at. After
his fall, the independent ratepayers became larky,
and while one half of the assemblage pounded the
floor with the furniture, the other half thre v the
undeveloped hen at the speaker. Meanwhile one
or two individuals, with great presence of mind,
inquire!, “ If he was in favour of making the road
two chains wide and putting up a three-rail fence
on the right hand side?’’ Yes, these were his
sentiments. Also, “ Was he p epare! to support a
vote for the erection of a culvert in the
creek just ahint of Maggie Ryan’s cockatoi
fence?” He was. Furthermore, “ Did he think the
Government should send 50,000 tons of flour to
Croydon, and would he approve of having shandy-
gaff laid on at the principal mines?’ Yes, he
approved of the shandy gaff, and he would give
Mr. Rafferty the contract to lay it on. Thin, be
gobs, he was j ust the broth of a boy to represent
the district; in Parliament, and when he got in
wouldn’t he raise h—l, and—but here the
squashy, undeveloped hen took the mover in the
eye, and the chairman left the chair, and the
lights went out, and the audience departed with
a general “ Hurrocsh." and carried out with them
a publican who had been shouldering, ilia way”tO
the front with the avowed intention of “rubbing
Ivimey’s nose on the f 'Jie.” ' Politics are rather
an exciting science-up in the Gulf country, and a
candidate has g<jl to keep moving. If he stops too
long in one sp >o t, eomcttrng is bound to hit him
before he gets away
The mission of the mild, soft-soapy U.
Tsing and the martial Wung Yung Ho is already
bearing fruit; the little Chinky-man is riz. When
the General’s despatches reached Pekin, and it
became known that the Chinee couldn’t eat his
chow-chow and his kitten-hash in peace beneath
the shadow of the Australian flag, a meeting was
called at Soo Chow, with Ho-ki fu in the chair,
and after that eminent official had smoked
tv>roe pipes of opium he ross and asked
in a glowing speech if these thing? were to be
endured. Then somebody binged a tom-tom in
the body of the hall, and the audience yelled as
one leper “ Chink-i-sly.” The furrin’ devil must
be made to walk a chalk-line in his future deal-
ings with the Asiatic, or el-e the biler would
burst and send him kite-high. (Cries of Hi-
kum.”) At present the unclean dog put his boots
in the eye of the Children of the Central Flowery
Land, but the time was at hand whea
the M( ngol would. take his eye oat of
the track, and would knock him into
one cooked-hattee. Sam ki then rose and asked
that the pig who came out of the Far West
should be taxed 500 dollars. (A voice : “ Hi-ky.”)
He wasn’t sure about the hi-ky, bat perhaps it
might be done. If it were possible to brand the
barbarian, say, on the back, it would be as good a
way as any, and then a law could be passed that
the barbarian should take off his clothes at the
order of any citizen and show that the brand was
there all right. Yangtse ky, who was very old,
and who was held up by his son, considered that
the foreign devil should get a receipt for his poll-
tax, and that the paper on which it was written
should be rendered accursed by having his
malignant features painted thereon; also that
it shou’d describe his genealogy tack even
to his grandmother, on whose grave he
trusted the dog? would camp out eternally,
and thereby prevent one defiled wretch passing
himself off for another—whose ancestral tomb, he
also trusted, would be profaned and have dirt
shot on it. A mandarin, whose nams the reporter
failed to catch, considered that these suggestions
were too light, and moved that they should adopt
the practice of a tribe called the Irish, and “poy-
kot ’’ the grasping heathen, (Ories of “Ah chew.”)
Ha would explain. To ” poy-kot ” a man proparly
he was cut off across the waist, and his upper
halt ilanted on a red-hot stove. This kept him
alive for some time, and his legs were then plac ;d
in front of him on a plate. (Loud applause.)
Another way was to cub off his feet, and then slit
him open and put his feet inside him. He was
then dropped 900 feet over a cliff. At this stage
of the proceedings Ho-ki fu hit a gong nine times,
and put the question to the meeting, when it was
carried unanimously, and the assemblage dis-
persed amid cries of “Yep ”
In the schools the kids are singing.
For the winter’s cold has flad ;
And the summer time is bringing
C arses less on Inglis’ head.
A member of the Evening Nooze staff has
bsen knocked down by a butcher's cart. When

A few months “ quod ” is all you have to fear ;
But if you’re poor and you annex a bob,
Your dose is lad'ed to you by the year.
The Evening Noose has been wiped out.
No longer can it claim the champion belt of Mun-
chausen or Ananias. The Murrurundi Times has
gone one better than Alfred's snake and shark
marvels. It gives a detailed account of a bullock
whose eye was so sore that the owner drove it to a
veterinary surgeon, who, a'ter chloroforming the
beast, took out the eye and discovered in the
socket a nest of bees busy making honey. The
eye is now all right, and so is the editor.
Dear Bulletin,—la the Caotlereagh dis-

difference of wages at the different shed?, and
just by chance struck on it to-day. I heard a
man, at leas': an image oti a Scotchman, actually
putting up the manager- to the fact that a pound a
week was plenty, and. that he was satisfied. On

Almost every Calico Jemmy in the North

The British Pension L : st is a curious
thing. Mr. Edwin Chadwick retired on account
of ill-health in the year 1854. He retired on £lOOO
per jesr. He was then 65 years of age. He is
still alive-only 98 now, and willing to take
another pension we have no doubt.

The only detect in this epigrammatic message is
that it neglects to say how much of the enthu-
siasm centred in the railway, and how little en-

Dr. Cortis, M.P. for Bathurst (N S W.),
attributes tho disasteis of the colony to the thrift-
lessness of the people. It is absurd to seek to go
into such researches as these. If electors are mad
enough to make members out of such productions
as Dr. Cortis, it is vain work looking for the
causes of local disaster.
Commodore Commander Heusner has been
accused of deliberately picking a quarrel with the
niggers for the purpose of deposing Malietoa and
appointing Tamasese. Join Bull, being the in-
ventor and sole proprietor of this nefarious little
plan of annexation, is naturally riled to find it
copied and used against him.
Premier Parkes, in responding to a toast
at Adelaide, last week, asked, “ Why should wa
not be ene people in Australia?" Well, the
answer is easy. Because we have on hand a
bogusly venerable party named Parkes who keeps
himself in political power by making people chew
each other’s ears off over sectarian cries.

A Sydney man has made a cooking stove,
and the D.T. jubilates in half a column over what
it calls “Another Freetrade Industry.” That a
about the fiasheat name we ever heard for a gas

Industry,” the maker's confession that he lost
money by it, is natural, appropriate, and self-
evidently truthful.
Amongst other curiosities of the Victorian
Government it may be mentioned that since Gillies
has been in they have shown a tendency to drift
into monarchy. Duncan is Minister of almost
everything, an Acting Mini-iter does the s’ock
work for him, and in all non-routine affairs in half
the departments of the country’s business he
works his own sweet will.
Will Mr. J. P. Abbott exp’ain why it is
that the only persons in the Wentworth electorate
(N.S.W.) whom he recommended to be placed on
the Commission of the Peace are station-owners
or managers ? Does he wish it to be assumed that
the only eligible persons in the electorate—which
extends from the boundary of Victoria to that of
Queensland—are squatters ?
Henniker Heaton, M.P., without the
slightest regard for the feelings of poor Pulsford,
says that Protection is gro ving wonderfully in
Great Britain ammg tha people and their repre-
sentatives. Even Manchester is catching on, and
the adoption of a Protective policy in England -
whose fiscal policy Sir ’Enry declares he has
copied—is only a matter of a short time.
Freetrader Oortia says that the Bight
Hour system is the cause of the N.S.W. depres-
sion. He is about as near right as a man of his
calibre can be on political matters. Under Free-
trade, the Bight Hour system always will be a
cause of depression. As we have shown a hun-
dred times, the hours of local labour must be
lengtheued unless our producers receive adequate
tariff protection.
Sir Sawmill Griffith ia coquetting with
Protection, and, if he survives the now inevitable
general election, will probably go the whole hog.
Witness his reception of the sugar growers, when,
inter alia, he remarked that “Although some
people regarded a reciprocity treaty as a treason
and a heresy, I consider it a sensible plan for
securing the safety of our own interests.” Its only
the first step that costs.
Parkes possesses a very convenient
memory. In his speech at Adelaide last week ho
indulge 1 in some sound criticisms of the Federal
Council flzz'e, but he forgot to explain that the
drafo bill agreed to by the Intercolonial Coaveu
tioa in 1884 was almost an exict copy of one
which he submitted to a conference that sat in
Sydney in 1881. So much for the consistency and
the prophetic wisdom of the G O.M of N.S. W.
“ Judicial Barbarity in China ” is the cap-
tion of an article in the Sydney Echo, Barbarous
judges are not slated by th t cautious journal
unless they are beyond the jurisdiction. And,
similarly, it may be taken for a dead certainty
that there are in China grovelling little Echos
which laud every act of the barbarous judges of
that land. A judge, is never without honour
within the territory over which his court exer-
cises jurisdiction.
When Sir William Manning was appointed
to the N.S.W. Supreme Court Bench, it was con-
tended that his pension as So icitor-G-nerai
merged into h : s judic’al sa'a-y, and this view was
acted upon. But now. Sir William being on the
eve of retirement, high legal authorities give it as
their opinion that the veteran (who, by the way,
has bean 55 years in harness) is entitled to his
pension of £BOO a year as tx Solicitor-Genera 1 , in
addition to his judicial pension.
Mr. M. H. Davies, solicitor, will be the
new Victorian Speake *. His qualifications for the
office so splendidly fi led by Mr. Lalor are nil.
He has had three years’ experience in Parliament
wi h >ut showing any politic*! abi icy. He is part
proprietor cf the Sydney D T., and son-in-law of
Riv. Dr. Mercer Mr. Davies has made lots of
money in land-sneeulation. He gave £lO,OOO to
the charities at J übilee time, aid when he gets the
Speakership he will be made a K.C.M.G. Then
he will be happy.
It is somewhat unfortunate for the N.S.W.
Boy Politician. Mr. B R. Wise, that the Sydney
D.T, has lately acquired a fearfully low estimate
of his capacity as a Minister. It is strange that
a paper which arrogantly claims to have dictated
Garrett's land policy, and ac aas abject idolater
and apologist for the Parkes party, in globo,
should turn to smite Mr. Ringnose Wise. The
D. T. might profitably remember that the NSW.
B.P. is politically clean, in which respsct he is
almost singu ar and solitary as far as the Cabinet
are concerned.
Sic ’Enery has been suggesting that all the
tr sops in Australia shou’d be concentrated upon
whatever point might be threatened by an enemy.
The on’y difficulty is that the enemy might change
his mind and go somewhere else while the troops
were waiting for him. He might even politely
send a telegram to Sir 'Enery requesting an inter-
view at Sydney, and then faithlessly drop ia at
Melbourne or Brisbane, cr anywhere, and 1 ava
the Grand Centennlalist in the lurch. Here is a
chame for some of the local Soudanese to propose
something that will go “ one better.”
“ Pass it on.” The tale is told of a certain
publican, in a certain Western town, who for
many years past has been d'ung business with one
certain brewer, nearly always purchasing hogs-
heads of ale said to coata’n 54 gallon?. Of late,
however, the excise tickets on these casks show
that the duty paid thereon was for 51 gallons,
although the casks are of the same size as for-
merly, and the publ can has to pay for 54 gallons
still. If this is true, the Government either lose
9d, per cask, or the publican has been “had” for
4s, on every cask for many years past.
Queenslanders want to know why they
can’t have their own Mint and tnrn out their own
sovereigns. The Sydney Mint authorities received
in 1886 from Queensland 329,357 ounces gold
(value £1,152,749); from N S W,, 91,855 ounces ;
N.Z., 34,519 ounc s; other places. 19,435 ounces.
Total, 475,166 ounces. The 1886 receipts were
53 000 ounces more than during any one of the
preceding ten years, although the N.S.W. yield
was then the smallest of any year. Victoria,
having a Mint of he? own, very properly protects
her own interest and keeps her treasure to herself.
On the eve of his retirement (with a good,
but well-earned, pension) from the Speakership of
the Victorian Assembly, old Peter Lalor has made
a wonderful discovery. He has found that, as
members are not allowed to write out their un-
spoken speeches at the table of the House of
Commons in order that they shall look nice in the
loeal papers, no more shall they be permitted to
do so in Australia Felix. He forgets the many
leading articles manufactured at the Victorian
table for the Ballarat leading journal from time to
time—nay, almost any time since the Eureka
Stockade.
Henry George has written a letter to the
Brisbane Courier, in which he sits down pretty
heavily on that journal for its exertions to
exempt the Queen-street landlords from the pro-
posed land-tax. The capitalised prairie value of
the Queen street property is £1,600,000, and at an
interest cf, say, 5 per cent, would yield an income
of £73,331, which (as George says) is, every penny
of it, a tax on industry- He sajs he argues on
the lines laid down in a book (“ Progress and
Poverty”) which, though tabo.ed now, will, at
no distant dale, be bo and io the hides of its
greatest deriders—the landlords.
Dr. Hearn, Q C., of Melbourne, is to be
consulted oa the subject ot North Queensland
separation This is btcau.se the Professor is a
great Constitutional lawyer. He's a “ big wig ”
in fact, he wears two big wig i, one when he’s out
of court, and two when he’s in it Oa the lat er
occasion, the outer one is of the usual horse-hair.
Hearn was the man who was defeated in Bast
Melbourne by Geo’ge Coppin when the Argus
whined that that constituency had ‘ preferred
the low comedian to the constitutional lawyer. ’
Professor Hearn is one of the alumni of the
Queen’s College, Galway, Iceland.
It is by no means certain that Premier
Gillies is destined to hold Lis innumerable port-
folios for ever. He has been engaged for the pa.t
twelve months in contending that certain public
officers are the only proper parsons to try cases in
which they are personally interested, and in which
their verdict cm only bo one way unless they
choose to S'gn their own warrants of dismissal.
The circumstances were published in the Age
and Melbmrne Herald nine or ten months back
and never denied, and now they are corroborated
by an official letter from the Governor of Victoria
to one of the parties coacomed. It would be in-
teresting to kno w how much of Ihis goes on while
outiiders are falling down and worshipping at
Dan cun’s feet.
Referring to England, Parkes declares
that ‘ sho says to the wide world that she is pre
pared to hold out the right hand of fellowship to
receive their riches and to pour hers into
the r laps as the laws of Nature demand an in-
terchange.’ To show the nature of England’s
gooifel owsbip, let us quote a few lines from
Mulhall-an authority who is worshipped by all
Freetraders :
“ Under the nlea of introducing Preetrade, Great Britain
has Deea privileged to send British manufactures exempt
from Customs duties to India and elsewhere, while the pro-
ducts of India—.ice, tea, and sugar—continue liable to
Customs duties in British port l . An examination of the
annual account* of Great Britain and India reveal significant
happen from duly, and show great zeal for Frectrdde abroad
and little concern for the same doctrine at home. The English
revenue from Customs is exactly ten times as large as the
Indian receipts from the same source."
Freetrade in Eng«
land has ruined Irish in-
dustry. Irish'butter goes
down before the produce
of France and Holland,
who in their turn tax all
English and Irish butter.
In like manner the beef
and flour trades of Ire-
land are being percep-
tibly crushed out of exis«
tence by the competition
of Protectionist America,
England is practically
the only market open to
Irish industry, as things
are at present, and per-
haps the next boat thing
to Home Rule would be
to impose a slight protec-
tive duty in favour of
Irelan d’s staple products.
The South Australian
Assembly has in two
successive sessions passed
a Bill to impose a poll-
tax on Chinese landing in
the Northern Territory,
but the money-bags cf
the Upper House have
rejected it. The Govern-
ment have it in the n
power, under the Con-
stitution Act, to dis-
solve both Houses with
a view to an appea Ito the
electors on the question,
but in the present com-
plicated state of affairs
it is hardly likely that
they will adopt this
course. The N.T, wil'
be useless to S.A. until
measures are taken to
prevent invasion by bai •
barian hordes.
I A Mr. Phillips has bean studying the
“politics of Shakespeare,” and in a lecture de
livered before a Melbourne literary society, a few
evenings ago, dec’ared his belief that the immorta
William was a communist. He based his opinion
on the following speech delivered by Gonzales in
“The Tempest" :
“ In the Commonwealth, I would by contraries,
Execute a'l things; for no kind of traffic
Would I admit; no name of magistrate;
Letters should not be known ; riches, poverty,
And use of service, none; contract, succession,
Biron, bound of land, tilth, vineyard, none.
No use of metal, corn, or wins, or oil,
No occupation; all man idle—all;
And woman too."
lEyen the S.M. Herald is commencing to
ose faith in old England’s passionate love for her
olonias la a recent sub-leader on the mail con-
tacts tha S.M H. “up”and says :
“ We heard a great deal at the Colonial Conference about
he regard which G-e »t Britain entertains for her colonies,
t is gratifying to be told that we stand so high in the affec-
ions'f people at home, but it is rather disappointing to
ind, when we come to practical matters, that Great Britain
las one thought for her colonies and two thoughts for
lerself.”
Df course it is very sad for the Herald to
ind out how hollow its “Mother Country”
'etish is. When a paper has turned itself
aside out to prove how loving and generous
ire England’s actions, it’s rather “ disappointing”
;o find out suddenly what an awful pawnbroker
she is.
There are just six pensioners upon the
revenue of Victoria. They are, of course, apart
from the ordinary Civil Service ones. First comes
Sir C. G. Duffy, with £lOOO a year, which he has
drawn to the great delight of the Southern colony
for ,j ust 24 years now. In other words, Victoria has
paid£24,ooo for the advantage of having Sir Charles
Duffy as Ministar of Lands for about two years
and a half! Lady Darling has drawn £lOOO a year
for 17g years, or £17,500 in all. Then there are
£866 13s. 4d. to the Hon. H. C. E. Childers, which
has to be paid to him when the G.O.M is in the
cold shades of opposition expounding the Home
Rule or other questions, and Childers is out in the
co’d, too. G W. Rusdan gets £5OO a year, which
will help to piy Bryc .-’a verdict and casta. Sir
Andrew Clarke draws £BOO, in spite of being in
receipt of pay from the English Government; and
Mrs. Petrie’s little sum of £lOO a year winds up
the list. It was granted as long ago as 1851 for
the meritorious conduct of Captain Flinders,

We were asked to look at her, the hat was blue with
anary coloured trimming, the gown pink with a blue flower
over it and round the waist was a bright cardinal material
with plenty of it, at the back. Our thought turned from
this combination to that seen in the beautiful Naerede-
Pearle g ass and we readilv voted that there are Artists and
Artists, To the refind in taste it is a real treat to carefully
examine the works of the Potter made for us" as well as
adornment which are to be seen at Bray Bros., 402 and

Mis, A, K Finlay, (the widowel daughter
of Sir Hercules Robinson), will bring a handsome
jointure to Mr. Charles Durant, her new husband,
Glenormiston being one of the richest estates in
Austia’ia. The late Mr. A. K, Finlay was one of the
only two Australians who have contracted a matri-
monial alliance with vice-royalty, the other being
Mr. Charles Bright, who married a daughter of
Viscount Canterbury.

Mr, Rupert Clarice, our only baronet’s

at Brighton (Eng.), The news was received with
considerable disappointment by our only Baronet,
who is anxious to see the “ direct succession ” as-

would be only fit and proper, yerknow, for these
interesting events to come off at the ancestral
home of the Clarkes. Our Gracious Queen always
retired to Windsor Castle at such time?.

Lady Loch's “Queen’s Fund” continues
to meet with the scantiest kind of encouragement
from the loyal citizens of Victoria, although all
kinds of efforts are being made to secure subscrip-

—has been appointed secretary to the fund, and is
conducting a house-to-house canvass, but she is
meeting with little more encouragement than it

The present Yice-regal regime of Tasmania
is somewhat economica l , The other d*y Lady
Hamilton traveled all tte way from Hobart to
Launceston, 120 miles, to have a consultation
with the local Jubilee people. Her ladyship on
arrival did not leave the railway station, and so
all parties had to wait upon her. She had brought
sandwiches with her, and these shs quietly ate
while the members of her committee discu-sed
the desirableness of founding a Children’s Hos-
pital. Having concluded the consultation, the
lady went into the Park opposite for a stretch,
and thereafter immediately took train back to
Hobart. The free pass on the line covered the
cost of everything.
It has just transpired that there is an
extra Knight of the Garter somewhere whom
nobedy knew anything about. When a “ Garter ”
dies his badge is solemnly returned to Her
Gracious, and is passed on by her to somebody
else, which is only one more way cf getting into a
dead man’s clothes ; but when the Sultan Abdul
Aziz was sent out of existence by the aid of a
pair of scissors he died amid much confusion,
and his garter never turned up. Probably it is
now in the possession of some lean and dirty
Moslem in Syria or Anatolia, who created himself
a Knight without asking Victoria’s permission,
and possibly some day, when a State function is in
progress, he may roll-up in his turban and blanket
and his two long brown legs and insist on taking
part. If he does, there will most likely be a row.

The result of the recent sensational elope-
ment from Sandhurst (Vic.) is a suit for divorce
instituted by Mrs. King, the wife of the “gay
Lothario.” The petitioner is 30, and Henry John
King, the respondent, is 32. The latter, in a
letter to bis wife, says that he will placa no diffi-
culties in the way of the divorce, and that when it
is granted he will immediately proceed to marry
Miss Margaret Charlton, the young heiress with
whom he ran away to Sydney. However, the
great problem is—Will Miss Charlton proceed to
marry this latest addition to the world s long roll
of giddy music-teachers ? Apropos of the frivolous-
ness of the guild in question there is the story
of the Parisian lady, who, when told about the
spotless innocence of the English Queen Elizabeth,
drily observed : * Ah, then site never could have
had a music-master.”

view of the matter than that. She claims main-

A tremendous demand has arisen in
Hobart for arnica and Wizard Oil, while homes
are left un'idy, children uncared for, and dinners
uncooked. All this means that a skating rink
has been opened in that city which draws hko a

voted to ladies and children, consequently bruises
and aches are the principal topics of conversation

It Sydney now-a-days, the proper caper is
to give a skating-party instead of a danca. It is
so much cheaper, you know ; one can give four
big skating parties for the cost of one small ball.
To say nothing of the fact that tin kudos attach-
ing to four skating parties, each one of them re-
ported at full length in the dailies and fat week-
lies, is something tremenjious.
Dear Bulletin.—
The recant homicidal
mania of a squatter ha 3
just brought to nrnd an
argument that I had with
soma ca'.ny Scotch folk
anenta “daft minister."
Probably you ramemb r
him, poor old S . I
contend that, as soon as
a man becomes by com-
mon cmsent, known to
the war Id as “cranky,
“fooly,” “loony," “daR,”
&c., than he should • e
under some sup rvision
or guarantee. Witness
a ytuag gentleman wlo
was boarded with a far-
mer because he was soft
and had entered in h’s
diary, “Today I killed
a little boy,” which®in
sooth he had done. Agar l ,
a labourer called Tom
Arnott took it into his
head that the Free Church
of Scotland had formed
api A against him. The
outcome was that he
murdered a boy v i h a
road-hammer. In this
country “Cranky Teste*’’
slew a little girl because
her father was a d d
Scotchman ; and so on ad
nauseam ad infinitum.
On the Rivers and in the
back-blocks there are
hundreds of peripatetic
cranks, and it is a dis-
graceful fact that they
are made the sport of
those who ought to know
better. This last sen-
tence is one for them and
two for yours tending
that way: Scotty the

A religious lady up
South—not unknown to
pulpit fame receives
her monthly supply of
dairy produce from a
certain country district.
A little while ago she
wrote to the storekeeper
who supplies the butter,
&e , requesting permis-
sion t o occasionally send
small p ircels when re-
turning the supposed-to-
be empty basket, for the
benefit of a church
bazaa ’, as she “ consi-
dered it her duty to save
the Lord’s twopences
when practicable.” As
“empties” are con-
veyed by coach free,
while one shill ; ng is
charged for each parcel,
the said twopences are .
saved at the expense of the coach-proprietor.
Yet surely such a devout woman must have
read, “ Render unto Cmsar,” &c.

Here is a pathetic tale of the British
nobility. One beautiful autumn evening a few
weeks ago, when the sun was sinking in the blue
waters of the English Channel, the Dowager Lady
Meux sat weeping on the Calais jetty. She was
reclining on a jewel-case containing diamonds
valued at £7OOO, and her feet were elevated on a
bonnet-box, and her maid, who was also weeping,
was inclined to be hysterical, and drummed on
the planks with her feet. They had lost the boat,
and were all forlorn. At last the boo hoos of the
lady attracted the attention of a gentlemanly
stranger, who presented his card, and volunteered
to take charge of them and see them across by the
evening boat, and, in addition to this, he looked
after the luggage, and put up at the same hotel
with them and brought the lady an early cup of
tea before she was up, and otherwise officiated as
tame cat to the tearful female Next evening he
bowed himself out, and went about his own busi-
ness, and 48 hours later the peeress opened her
j ewel- case. Then arose a shriek which rang through
the listless hotel and the blase club next door—a
shriek that scudded down the tracks of the back-
yard, and scared the early piety out of the waiter.
The gentlemanly stranger who brought up the cup
of tea in the morning had gone with the diamonds,
and the lady was left insolvent.
Parkes told the Adelaideians the other
night that he was the most solitary man in Aus-
tralia. Has “ the Wanderer ” been enjoying the
blis j of solitude ever since that night when he
and Stella found themselves mantled in snow
“ six thousand feet above the sea, love ” ?

At a recent social shivoo, that particularly

Mayor Riley has been going it a little too
strong for the Compbelltown Herald’s fancy. At
the mayoral luncheon, Sir Alban unbosomed him-
self over the wine, and informed the assembled
guests that when he “ first thought of accepting
the office of Mayor of the gr. at city of Sydney
his wife cried, and did all she could to dissuade
him from taking the step.” Editor Webb states

that he was present at his Worship’s election, and
remembers well that so anxious was Mrs. Riley
over ths contest that as soon as the newly-elected
Mayor emerged she threw her arms around him.
and gave him about the warmest kiss he ever had.
Details of this kind are harrowingly domestic.

Tee gory falsehood trotted out by the
Evening Nooze and the Echo to the effect that
Wyndham, the religious maniac, slaughtered

about time that Alfred offered up some of his
prize pigs—or prize bulls—to appease the gods for
all the outrages on eternal truth that his staff

Miss Cleveland, sister of President Cleve-

in New York. We don’t know exactly what a
sub-directress is, but if it is anything like
a lady superintendent, there will be trouble in
that school before the lovely spring time comes
again. #
Dr. Neild, who conducted the post mortem
on the unfortunate Miss Swain, stated that in all
his experience he never met such a fine figure of a
woman. As a veteran theatre goer and dramatic
critic the doctor must have put his glasses on
plenty of female beauty, so his opinion is worth
something. 1i this connection we are pleased <o
see that the Melbourne Her \ld was able to con-
tradict “ a painful rumour that deceased was
buried without her having been washed and
dressed ” Acoerding to the Herald Dr. Neild
himself assisted to make Miss Swain’s last earthly
toilet. Such details as that reflect credit on the
enterprising ghouls who dig them up for public
edification. Tae news that a poor girl’s 00-psa
was carefully washed will make sunshine in many
an Australian home.

He was a very eminent Australian citizen
down north, and she was the recognised wi'e of
his bosom—his official wi f e, in short. One night,
a week or two ago, he informed her—same old
story—that ho had urgent business at the office,
and straightway departed thence. She, actuated
by a desire to go shopping, suddenly took a tram,
and while walking past an office heard a sound of
revelry by night borne upon the breezes. Recog-
nising the voice of He, she stopped before the door
and knocked. He, from within, enquired who it w. 8
that demanded almrttanoe. She, from without*
said “Me.” Ho replied, ‘Go hone. lam busy, j
[He wa».] But she refused to go, and waited. Then
she grew furious, and, with her umbrella handle,
smashed a pane in his office window, and dis-
covered He in company with another She. She
No. 1 then equeezod her way in at the door, which
he, terrified at the disturbance, had incautiously
half opened. Sundry bottles of fizz were on the
table, one of which she picked up and
with it half-brained She No. 2, A Homeric
battle ensued. He got bitten by the boss
She, who, after she had expanded the
froth of her rage, hastily clutched and departed
with various disjecta membra of attire always
wanted on any voyage and with these fled into
the streets. The rest of the story is that when
the partner of He arrived at the office nest morning
he was so convinced that a burglary had been com-
mitted that he placed the matter in the hands of
the detectives. The result of their enquiries is as
above. A stormy session may be looked for by
that honourable member.

What is considered a novelty in Paris is a
dress-suit made in one piece. The waistcoat has
no back, the shirt consists of a front, the cuffs
are stitched into the coat-sleeves, and a single set
of buttons fixes the whole contrivance. There’s
nothing new ’neath the sun. The ‘' first part ”
dress-suits in a minstrel show are “ faked” in

Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings,
&c. This from the “ ever popular journal:
11 From a table of mortality statistics just published, it
appears that the death rate among pubiic-house or hotel
servants is nearly four times as high as.that for clergymen or
ministers, who show the lowest rate of mortality.”
We now give another specimen or two
" From unoompiied data it is shown that those who inter-
view J ames Hennessy have a higher rate of mortality th an
steady labouring men who do not drink or smoke.”
“ From the death rate of a well-known statistician it ap-
pears that men who are blasted by dynamite are more sub-
ject to inquests than prisoners in an easy gaol.”
“ The percentage of deaths on a battle-field during action
is 4500 times more than that of the Sydney Lancers ”

There is a gaol in Queensland where the
lady boarders have quite a good time of it. One
of the fair creatures “is allowed at all hours into

Id another prison, at Townsville, one hard-labour

he speaks very unfavourably of the officials, who

take part in the chess tournament, although he
was' willing to pledge his word that he would re-
turn sometime or perhaps a little later. Gaol life
in Queensland, according to the recent Commia
sion, appears to be rather a rosy existence—if you
get into the proper sort of gaol. The Commis-
sion’s stories almost remind one of the state of

The heavy father or stern parient of the
stage is likely to have a new part written for him
at last. A certain couple recently perpetrated a
runnaway marriage, and, in the fullness of time,
the hot-headed pair returned, and the bride,
kneeling at dear Papa’s feat, all blushes, bustle,
and briny tears, exclaimed, “Forgive, forgive me
dearest father, for the sake of my poor sainted
mother in heaven I ask you to forgive your erring
child.” “ Forgive yer ! ” shouted the old man ;
“why, gorstrooth, I’m only too glad t’ get rid of
yer; and I’d have helped you to go long since
only you’re so confoundedly pig-headed that if I
had encouraged yeu- in the least you’d have


pitched th’ man o’ yer heart to the living jingo
years since. You were never worth your keep,
an’ your bad temper, extravagance, idleness, and
scandalous goings on with fellers here have made
you the plague o’ my life, and if you hadn’t gone
off soon I'd have had to drown myself. Take her,
young man—you’ve been the best friend I ever
had —take her right away to T erusalom, or Japan,
if you like —and be happy with her if you can.
The young man said nothing, but as he arose and
dusted his knees he looked like a patty who could
do a vary great deal of thinking.
Miss Frances Gillam Holden has issued a
volume of verse, ‘ • Her Father’s Darling and other
Child Pictures,” for which William Woolls,
Ph. D , F.L.S., has written an introduction, but
we hardly think the book will get hold of the
wools of the multifariously minded crowd, as the
lady author is a better advertiser tian poet. The
■collection is dedicated to Mrs. Alban Riley, but
there is not much ii it. If the so-called poems
are intended for the nursery they will serve their
purpose fairly, and that is about all one can say of
them, though for the sake of fairness we annex a
sample
“'Oo tissei me, ’oo naugh’y uncle.
And I didn’t want to be tissed.”
It is needless to say that the speaker is of the
feminine gender, and consequently relents with —
“I won’t never hi i ’oo So hard aden,
I will let ’oo tiss me n-n-o : o w-w !’’
This is very true of the sex; they talk plainer,
perhaps, but still in the same strain at 18, or, for
the matter of that, at 80 ; but, shade of Phil.

jingle about “ puppies and kittens and babies ”
our triune abhorrence—the Queen’s Birthday,
kisses (children’s), “frank eyes,” “noisy chatter-
ings,” “silken tresses,” “woman’s deft and gentle
touch,” “ferny fronds,” “gentle meanings,”
“little gasps for breath,” admonitions to “pick
the dearie up” and put her “nice white nightey
on”—whatever that may mean —“ wee piggies,”

The c-epuscu’ar and unsubstantial wraith
that gibbers and squirms along in the antipodal
dust under the delirious misnomer of “ Colonial
Sassi ty ” is a miserably flunkeyish and grovelling
imitation of the brand that passes current beneath
the remote effulgence of the Ursa Major, stamped
with the ball-mark of aristocratic approval and
gilded with a sheeny smile which is a reflection of
Albert Edward’s tawny bear!. Wales waltzes
round with a tinplate or a Royal dish cover and
collects “ dibbs ” for the Imperial Institute. He
exhibit his fleshy shoulders at football matches
and church bazaars on consideration of nailing
the coin for his pet insanity. Carington at
creation’s end, though not blessed with avoirdu-
pois or baldness, dees his best in a similar fashion,
as well as he knows how, and attempts to realise
the “ thirgucsj of the unhere” in woeful efforts
to All the honoured saucer of the Queen’s Fund—
the gubernatorial mode of committing charPy.
This was admirably exemplified by the advertise-
ments anent a recent grand fancy dress skating
carnival which, with brazen effroateryandunblush-
ing truthfulness, announced that the catch of the
night was no hoax ; “Lord and Lady Carington
will positively he pie ent. . . . One-third of
the proceeds to he devo'ed to the Queen’s Fund.”
After this the informat on that “ all skaters mutt
be in fancy dress, ’ though “ a few will be allowed
in evening dress,” falls flat and lame like kerosene
on a whisky-tinctured pa’ate. But the affair did
not by any means prove the boom it was expected,
and now herculean efforts are being put forth by
the ladies’ committee to make the Queen’s Fund a
fashionable fad with something “ dlstangy ”

Ladies fly off by centrifugal momentum. Gents pull ladies
hard and close. 1 hey red, swing, sdde. sling, look tender,
look silly, look dizz . Feet tty, dresses fly, skirts fly, all fly.
It looks tuggity, pullity, equetzity, rabbity rap. The men

aron Yon Mueller has a more biting
ue than we would have thought possible in a
gentleman whose life was given to the pursuit of
such a mild science as botany. At the reception
given to the Rov. Mr. Chalmers, the New Guinea
missionary, in Melbourne, a short while ago, the
Baron “expressed his admiration of the work
accomplished by Mr. Chalmers, and said he hoped
he would continue to widen the great science of
geography!” The dash is ours. The Baron
seems to think that the discovery of, say (for we
are not botanists), one new species of the order of
crjptogami is the cause of more joy in the civil-
ised part of Heaven than the conversion of seven-
teen dozen, or any other indefinite number, of
cannibals to the true faith. And possibly ho is
right.

WYLIE, THE CHAMPION OF THE WORLD.
A Prahran (Yic ) woman has obtained an
order for maintenance from her husband who re-
fused to support her, although she was deaf and
dumb. There is no pleasing some husbands.
Australia is still safe from the foreign in-
vader. A few nights ago one of her gallant de-
fenders was put to a terrible test at Ballarat. He
heard a noise in his house, and naturally seized
upon his small eighteen chambered revolver and
crept down the stairs, gritting his teeth. The
seventh shot was successful in blowing away a
portion of his left hand. The goat escaped with a
severe fright—chiefly occasioned, it is said, by the
fear that Colonel Sleep might have hurt himself.
The goat was an old retainer of the family, and
was only taking the clothes in at the time. Mil-
lions would not induce us to tell the name of the
gallant soldier connected with this affair!

the situation of many men who are almost as
good, if not quite so hirsute. But it seems that
Mrs. Clark performed the ceremony of “turning
on the gas” at a new gasworks the other day.
Hence the jeers. By this simple act Mrs. Clark
has become a celebrity. If she had “ turned off"
her husband’s “gas” she would have been a

We learn from a Queensland contemporary
that, on account of the small-pox which has
I broken out at Port Darwin, “fears are entertained
that the dread disease will get among the blacks
in the Northern Territory." This would be a tre-
mendous pity. Goodness knows, the poor civil
servants and troopers up there have not such a
good time that they can afford to have their bast
game worried about and rendered incapable of a
good day’s run by exotic diseases of this sort.
There is a considerable deal of popular indignation
in Port Darwin against small-pox, ani we do not
wonder at it—much. At the same time (if we
must tell the unvarnished truth about the matter)
we have lived for a short period in Port Darwin
and would have welcomed with open arms any
visitor —even the cholera morbus. This, however,
has nothing to do wish the prognosticated epi-
demic among the blackfeliows. They should be

The Rev. Mr. Chalmers must surely have

lecture which he delivered in Melbourne lately
that “ the missionaries had adopted the plan of
not interfering with a native who had more than

wished to ba baptised he was not asked < o deprive
himself of any of his wives. The missionaries
acted on the principle that the Gospel of God was
not given to man to cause sorrow to any living
soul.” This prodigious statement brought forth a
burst of applause—which, weregrefc to say, seemed
to proceed principally from the bald-headed part
of the congregation. We would like to know

From a Dublin paper we learn that “Mr.
John Wiliam O’Brien, B. i., M. 8., Co. 8., cf
Trinity College, having been examined, was
admitted a Fellow of the Royal College of Sur-
geons.” We are pleased to record the success cf
a yourg Australian in other lines of life than
cricket and rowing. Dr. O'Brien is a native of
Ballarat, and was educated as a civil engineer.
At 21 years of age he obtained certificates as a
licensed surveyor and mining engineer, and com-
menced active work. But having a penchant for
medicine he began studying it privately, reading
hard in his tent at night. In seven years he saved
enough money to be enabled to leave Australia
for Ireland and enter himself at Trinity College,
Dublin. At such an age it is not easy to afresh
commence grinding at Greek and Latin, but Dr.
O'Brien did so, took his Bachelor of Arcs degree,
and then walked the hospitals aid studied at the
College of Surgeons. Last year he took the gold
medal for surgery, and this year has gained his
fellowship. Such a record b ats that of our old
friend, Jacob. We understand that there is a
Rachel in this case who will accompany Dr.
O’Brien on his approaching return to Me bourne,
where he will commence practice. Advance

At Band wick races, last Saturday, a little
incident occurred which took well and gave plea-
sure to all. The races were over, and the fours-in-
hand were taking their departure, watched by an
admiring crowd. The Governor’s turn-out got
away all right, then the Union Club in fine style,
tooting their horn. Meanwhile the Australian
Club drag, with its load of swells, stood as stiil as
a stone. One by one the drags rolled off; at last only
two, belonging to members of the committee, were
left, besides the Australian Club drag. Then this
latter began to start to commence to begin to go
home, and then the horrid truth came out
that they had a scratch team of jibs, and no
amount of pushing, coaxing, or flogging could
get them to pull the concern a yard. The
grooms tugged at their heads, the crowd laughed,
and there this galaxy of gloved, long-collared,
long-hatted “chappies” sat, looking, oh 1 so
pleased. The driver, Mr. Maccabe, to give him
his due, was no novice with the ribbons, but he
couldn’t get the mongrel team he had to pull a
pound. It was very evident why they had let the
other drags get away—they didn’t want to make
a more awful exhibition of themselves than they
could help. At last the horses thought it was
getting near tea-time, and scrambled off. If the
Australian Club really is so much the pure merino
as we are led to believe, they ought to take decent
horses in their drag when they go to Randwick.

Mra. James, of Richmond (Vic.), who was
pleased to die lately and will £lBO2 to her son, a
newspaper reporter—the first one, by the way,
ever known to possess such a sum— directed that,
as she was afraid of being buried alive, her body
should be kept nine days above ground, also that
she should bo carefully bled in various parts of the
body, and that all the household cats and dogs
should be drowned by one of the unemployed
who was to receive ten shillings for the job.
After all, there seems to be a good deal in
a name. The S.M.H., in a Melbourne wire anent
the colliding of the ships Persian Empire and
Victoria Regina, says:—“The Viotoria Regina,
after the collision, backed off and proceeded on
without stopping to make any inquiries." Which
is exactly what her regal namesake would have
done if a stoppage had cost her any money. But
then she would set herself right (with the unini-
tiated) by wiring a collect “ sympathy ” as soon as
she got on shore.
A few days ago, a venerable lady, who
ought to have known better, got on the outside of
Loo much square gin, and was trotted out before
the Ballarat police court. “Are you married ?’g
asked the magistrate, to which she replied, “Sure
I’ve been a widow for 14 years.” “ Well,” re
marked the magistrate, who, by the way, was
rather absent-minded, “where’s your husband *"
Before she had time to reply, the kindly sergeant
reminded his Worship that she was a widow, and
thus saved further complications. As she left the
court she informed all whom it might concern
that: “If his Honor wanted to know where her
late husband was, she would tell him that he was
out of purgatory many a long year ago, and was
now living in the blessed Heaven with the holy
angels.”
THE LIVER IN THE SPRING.
The liver, located on the right side, b elow the
right lung, its lower edge being directly under the
short ribs, and extending across to the le ft side, is
not only the largest gland of the body, but is one
of the most) complex in its workings, and, liKe a
delicate piece of machinery, is easily thrown out
of order. Upon its proper action depends the
mental and physical welfare of the body. Any
one of the following symptoms indicates its de-
parture from health; —
Symptoms. Headache, sallow complexion,
gradually increasing constipation, disinclination
to exertion, vertigo, dizziness, highly coloured
urine, a “splendid” feeling to-day, and a de-
pressed one to-morrow; pain under either
shoulder, and under ribs on the right side, neu-
ralgia, pain of chesb, heartburn, indigestion, en-
largement of side below the ribs, dropsy of the
abdomen, dry mouth; brown, flabby tongue;
occasional chills, hot flushes, moth patches on
the face, yellowish eyeballs, sick headache, fre-
quent vomiting of bitter matter ; piles, canted by
congestion of the liver ; severe spasmodic pain in
upper part of abdomen, relieved by pressure,
hiccough, jaundice, claj -coloured stools, tour
stomach, variable appetite, irritability of temper,
dirrrhcea, dy sen try, burning palms and feet, dry
cough, sleeplessness.
The diseases which are indicated by any of the
above symptoms are jaundice, gallstones, enlarge-
ment, contraction, congestion, inflammation,
abscess, tumors, h/datids, catarrh of the ducts,
fatty accumulation, cancer, malaria, and last but
not least, biliousness, which is so common in this
country with both sexes.
History.—During winter, Nature wisely arranges
that we should live on foods containing much fat,
or, as they are known, hydro carbons, for the
purpose of supplying heat to the body; the
chemical operation necessary to transform
fat into heat is the exclusive work of the liver,
and so during the time stated it is constantly
congested. With the approach of warm weather
our diet changes to muscle-producing food, and
the work of the liver is much lessened. In the
majority of cases, however, it is unable to com-
pletely throw off the excess of bile, but remains
congested, causing that lazy, tired feeling which
many have in the spring months, when the
weather becomes warm. This is evidence of an
unhealthy condition, and though people appreciate
the necessity of an alterative at this period, the
common idea is to take drastic pills and produce a
cathartic effect, only to make matters worse.
The liver must be unloaded, and its proper action
restored before hot weather, if you wish to pre-
serve health, and if this distinct call of nature is
unheeded, serious results will occur. The blood
will become loaded with bile and lithic acid, and
as every drop of vital fluid passes through the
kidneys to be purified, they soon break down, and
are rendered unable to carry oat the deadly
poison.
'ireatment.—Warner’s safe cure and Warner’s
sa’e pills have not only a specific action on the
kidneys, but on the liver also. They thin the
thickened bile so that it will pass out through
its ducts, and so enable the glands to unload
themselves, act as a solvent on all biliary acids,
and, in a word, fit the liver for the season’s work,
preventing blood poisoning, inflammation, abscess,
and all affections to which it is so liable. As you
value the blessings of health, do not allow the
summer to approach without giving your system
a “general house-cleansing” with Warner’s safe
remedies. “ To be forewarned is to be fore-
armed.”

The Poet.
His thoughts are with the eagles,
Though his feet are limed with clay ;
He feels the flush of dawning
Ere others see the day.
He sees the Light Eternal
In sunset and sunrise ;
He sees it shining softly
In innocent young eyes.
No scorn has he of small things—
Life’s web of threads is spun ;
The sparkle in the dewdrop
May be some small world’s sun ;
The lowly violet weareth
The hue of heav’n above.
And tend’rest thoughts are highest,
As God Himself is Love.
His thought electric touches
God and worm at either pole ;
From the nadir to the zenith

The moat popular storekeeper at Croydon
is Bill Kelly ; but for him some hundreds of
men would have had to clear during last wet
season. There was something like four thousand
pounds of “tick” given by Bill, and now
some of the men who call themselves diggers
want a Chinaman’s store. Last wet season
“broke” pretty nearly all the stores up there,
and one cannot wonder that the charges are high.
An attempt is to be made to float the once
celebrated Queen’s Birthday Gold Mining Co.
(Dunolly, Vic.) on the London market. There are
two ways of getting a company over a poor time—
floating and sinking. It is Iflellous to say an
ordinary Company is “ sinking,” but not a mining
company. Some cf them float in order to sink,
and others only sink in order that they may be
able to float. The Queen’s is floating because it
wants to sink.
Mr. Long, of Croydon (Q.) is an awfully
.particular kind of person. The other day he fell
upon a man, and when he fell on the man the
man fell under a verandah, and then there was
an arrest and Mr. Long was brought up before the
court. He pleaded that he had received great
provocation, and whe ithe Bench demanded toknow
what the provocation consisted of, he explained;
“He didn’t call me Mister Long, your Worship. He
just called out ‘ Long,’ and then I got mad at
him.”

Dear Bulletin, —You are the only one
who has ventured to agree with me about the
terrible Wyndham tragedy, and when I read
your paragraph last Saturday I felt impelled to
write and say how your idea coincided with
mine. I have always thought (but feared it was
impious) it was a most revolting thing of God to
ask Abraham to kill his own son, and can quite
understand a religious maniac believing he heard
the Almighty demanding at his hands the lives of
those most dear to him. Do not all fanatics
believe only blood can appease their Deities ? And
the greater the anguish involved by such a sacri-
fice the greater, to the madman, would appear the
glory to be attained hereafter.—Yours truly, An
Admiring Bushwoman.— l3th September.
The Shearers’ Union— with Chinamen.—
Dear Bulletin,— l notice that the Seamen’s
Union have already offered valuable assistance to
the Shearers’ Union ; but if they are aware of the
fact that Chinamen are admitted as mem"
ber>, I question if they (bearing in mind the origin
of their great strike) would offer any assistance to
an amalgamated union of Chinamen and Euro
peans. One of the Shearers’ Union rules is that
all shearer.’ cooks shall become members of the
Union, with, of course, light of voting. Now, I
am prepared to prove that many Mongoliar s are
admitted under this rule, and with your permis-
sion will narrate a case in point lam emplcyed
at a shed in the vicinity of Balranal J. It is a
union shed, and the cook is a Chinaman. He is a
member of the Shearers’Union ; and when the
union representative called upon all to show
tickets of membeiship. Chinkie produced (trium-
phantly) evidenceof his right cf equality in the form
of a union ticket, and was duly elected, Johnny (sly
d"g) having taken the precaution to b:come a
member a month or two before the shearing.
Surely whitemen, knowing the number of white
men out of employment, even in this busy ceaion,
might give a whitemau a chance. They cannot
excuse their conduct upon the plea that John is
cleaner in his habits than one of their own colour.
If so. anyone acquainted with the habi’s of the
yellowskins either in this or their own country can
easily explain away that fallacy,— An Old Member

THE WORLDS GREAT BREWERIES.
The greatest beer-producing countries in the
world are Germany and Austria. By the last
annual official statistical showing, the output in
the aggregate of the six leading breweries of
tnese countries, in 1860 amounted to a total of
1,670,561 barrels. But there will be some satisfac-
tion in learning that St Louis, Missouri, U.S.A.,
has the largest brewery in the world. The
Anheussr Busch Brewing Association, in the
period covered by the official report quoted above,
manufactured and sold 13,120,000 gallons of
beer, equalling 410,000 barrels, an excsss of more
than 10 per cent, above the production of the
Spaten Brewery, of Munich, the largest European
brewery.
How to Gain Flesh and Strength.— Take after each
meal about a tablespoonful of “Slott's Emulsion of
Pure Cod Liver Oil With Hypophosphites.” It is
almost as palatable as milk, and easily digested. The
rap’d ty with which del-cate children and siotly people
suffering from weakness and wasting diseases improve and
thrive upon this diet, is truly marvellous. As a remedy for
Consumption, Throat Affections and Bronchitis, it is un-
equalled by auy other preparation in the world. Use it an l
try your weight. All chemists seil large and small bottles.*

BRITIRH NEW GUINEA.
Whether the contemplated “proclamation of
British sovereignty ” in Now Guinea will prove a
check on the Papuans’ desire to kill and eat white
men, remains to be seen. This trouble-producing
island was first annexed by Queensland through
the agency of a police magistrate and a union-jack
pocket handkerchief, Then Bismarck came along
and took a hand in the game by appropriating
about as much of the already annexed portion as
he thought he could do with, and a few months
after that Australia and England together annexed
What Bismarck had left. This appears to have
been a sufficient claim on the little property, until
the wily natives developed a too strongly marked
predilection for toasted native teacher and gulled
sailor hiac; And now; if the “proclamation of
British sovereignty” doesn’t put a stop to the
trouble; H. Mi cruisers will have to go in frr some
more gun practice on the cocoanut trees, and
land a storming party to capture some more empty
huts, f o hi a ch for the progre ss of civilisation in on e
d'rection, In another it is much more gratifying.
Thanks to the good missionaries, the virtues of
St. Jacobs oil are growing apace in the estimation
of the gentle savage. The master of the m's-
sionary schconer Ellnngowan and the captain of
the Governor Cairns write of it in the most
enthusiastic terms ; and captain Li'jftblad backs
up his testimony with a reference to the well-
known and popular “Tamate” (Rev. James
Chalmers). As a conqueror of pain it has no equal
in the world, and as a civilising agent it is far and
away superior to the Gatling gun or the Brennan
torpedo.
Mr. C, F. Smith, lately of the Queens-
land National Hank, at lllaekall, made a cool
£2500 by one investment at the Croydon.
Mr. Macdermott elicited from a witness in
the Melbourne Criminal Court a few days ago that
he could drink 14 glasses of rum “ without feeling
it.” The occupants of the front row of the gallery
gazed at this redoubtable swiper with mingled
feelings of admiration and envy.
We hear that the deepest level at Croydon
is 20(1 feet on the underlie at the Homeward
Bound. Beef better and bigger than ever ; on
the way down it got poor and narrow. There is
some chance for Croydon as a permanent field
after all, but nothing will be done till the leases
are granted in January next.
A Melbourne thief was captured the other
day with the cash hok of a Lonsdale- street publi-
can, containing £2O, which he violently distri-
buted in the mud. Zealous hands were soon at
work collecting the money of which the land-
lord received £0 10s. hack. Then the crowd
slowly dispersed, commenting on the villainy and
wickedness of the robber just run in.
The cure of the souls of four hundred and
fifty human beings was recently put up to auction
in London. The souls were in Lincolnshire and
the pay of the caretaker £472. Oaly £l6OO was
bid, and the lot was withdrawn. This elegant
provision for a younger son was let slide. Think
of it! Miss ions are sent to convert the heathen,
and yet the biddings for this divine billet in
Christian England did not reach reserve price.
Parnell as he is represented
by the Tory Press.
Parnell as he really is.
There is one admirable feature about a
wire fence. The patent medicine man can't paint
a legend on it in regard to his liver cure.
The crucifix is to be cut from the anti-
Madgwick reredos in St. Andrew's Cathedral,
Sydney, for fear some of the faithful may fall
down and worship it. We presume the Low
Church c’ergy will now proceed to sell the cross.
You bet they don't mean to carry it. The cross,
as an emblem of the modern Christian religion, is
played out. The lash and the gallows seem to be
the trade-mark of the pietists of N.S.W.
Sydney E. Nooze complains that it is
abominable that the Central Police Station should
be permitted to exist where it is. The Central,
you know, is so uncomfortably convenient to the
Noozb office. Or, perhaps, now we come to think
of it, the Central may be too far away from the
paper whose stock-in-trade is the drunk and in-
decent assault report. Possibly Alfred wants the
court shifted to his office.
Ex-Justice Sir Robert Molesworth, of
Victoria, devotes a deal of his spare time to read-
ing novels. He has had a lot of fact in his time,
and is now going iu for fiction as a change.
N.Z. has acquired the fee simple of another
Volcano which carries on the usual eruption busi-
ness at Curtis Island, one of the Kermadec
Group, which Sir Julius Vogel has recently caused
to be annexed.
A tale of chivalry reaches us from that
howling, squatter-ridden wilderness of a colony,
W. A. A member of that respected cosmopolitan
family, the Browns, was wending his homeward
way to a Perth suburb, pondering on the proba-
bility of Mrs. Brown not having the evening pie
nicely done, when wild female screams from an
adjacent field pierced his windward ear and made
him wheel around in astonishment. There he saw
a sight that made him jump the fence. A large
and furious pig was chasing two lovely females.
Brown faced the savage beast with his walking-
stick under the impression that it would retreat.
Brown had to retreat instead. Then he had to
climb the fence in double-quick time. As he was
just congratulating himself on his narrow escape,
the porker inserted its teeth in that part of his
pants which is never mentioned in gubernatorial
drawing-rooms, and carried off a large square
piece of imported tweed. Brown got mad, and
walloped the raging beast with his stick—from
the top of the force. Then he gathered up
the remnants of his tattered garment,
and walked painfully homeward, while the
rescued ladies put their hands before their
eyes and looked through—we mean looked a little
to one side. Taking advantage of a deficiency in
the fence the irate pig charged down again npon
poor Brown, who, like a competitor in a sack-race,
scooted with considerable difficulty. In the
awful moment, just as he was resigning himself to
a horrible death, the owner of the enraged ani-
mal appeared, and diverted its attention suffi-
ciently to allow B own to climb a convenient tree.
Once more the gentleman or gentlewoman who
pays the rent laid siege against the tree while its
persecuted victim held on b/ his eyebrows. By
this time the gentle youth of the neighbourhood
had gathered in battle array armed withborrowed
long-handled shovels and bass brooms, with which
they drove the enemy into a fenced allotment,
where it turned its snout into a peaceful plough-
share, whilst Brown limped home with his hands
fully occupied in shielding himself from the oxy-
gen of heaven, and followed by certain small boys,
who desisted only when they arrived at the Brown
domicile and encountered the family bull-dog.
