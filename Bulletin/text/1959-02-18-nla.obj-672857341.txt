MAUGHAM'S LAST WORD
Somerset Maugham’s conversation
has. of course, for years been among
the best to be heard from England;
and if. as he says in Points of View
(Heinemann), this is the last time he
is going to talk to the public, it is a
consolation that one can listen to his
books again at any time; and “Points
of View” is as firm as any of them.
This collection of essays begins, it
is true, with rather a dull study of the
novels of Goethe. It seems to be a
stray from that set of literary essays
Maugham wrote for the “Sunday
Times'" a few years ago, in which
about hqlf the piece would be a
biography of his author and the rest
a recapitulation of his plots; with, of
course, critical comments interspersed.
The form presupposed that his
readers knew nothing of his authors,
and, by conveying so much informa-
tion, was designed, perhaps, to save
them the labor of ever reading them
for themselves. Since Maugham does
not think much of “The Sorrows of
Werther,” less of “Wilhelm Meister’s
Apprenticeship” and still less of its
“muddled, incoherent and horribly
tedious” sequel, one might be grateful
to have Goethe’s novels thus read and
disposed of by proxy; but “Werther”
at least, the final pages of which
Maugham finds moving, though the
whole is no more than a period-piece,
still provokes a mild curiosity. A
really useful servipe Maugham might
have performed would have been to
have discussed Goethe’s “Faust” so
exhaustively that one would be
excused from ever wrestling with it
again; but on “Faust” he is mysteri-
ously silent.
However, there is not much wrong
with this essay, after all, except that
the plot of “Wilhelm Meister’s Appren-
ticeship” is interminable; and this is
certainly the only occasion when the
book lapses into dullness.
There is much more excuse for
Maugham’s method of “biocriticism”
in the essay on “Prose and Dr. Tillot-
son”; for of Dr. Tillotson, who said in
Charles the Second’s time that nobody
could lawfully defy his king—with
obvious reference to the probable suc-
cession of the Catholic James the
Second —and then somehow managed
to approve of the Revolution and the
accession of William and Mary to the
throne, not much is generally known.
Maugham paints a moving and con-
vincing picture of the old clergyman’s
perturbations of conscience in those
difficult times and of his reluctance,
indeed despair, when William insisted
that he complete his good works by
becoming Archbishop of Canterbury.
At the same time, while not unduly
admiring Dr. Tillotson’s prose, which
is supposed to have influenced Dryden,
Swift and Addison and which is chiefly
remarkable, or, rather, unremarkable,
for its plainness, Maugham seizes the
occasion for an excellent disquisition
on English prose: dividing it into “the
plain and the ornate” and, while care-
ful to give due credit to Gibbon and
Sir Thomas Browne, deciding in the
end that the “plain,” which he practises
so elegantly himself, is generally the
sounder candidate for immortality. It
is a simple and useful distinction and
might also be applied, though
Maugham does not carry it so far, to
poetry or to such freaks of prose style
as “Ulysses” and “Finnegans Wake”:
all sorts of bouncing devices may con-
ceivably come off, but in general the
style that wears best is the plain.
As by implication he approves of
his own prose Style in this essay, so,
quite openly, does Maugham praise his
own kind of short-stories in his interest-
ing essay on that subject: “I like best
the kind of story I can write myself.”
But here Maugham is not quite fair
to himself. If a predilection for his
own kind of writing would explain his
praise of Maupassant, his delightful
suspicion of Henry James, his quali-
fied admiration for Kipling and his
omission of any reference to the more
sonorous art of Joseph Conrad, it can
hardly be said that Chekhov’s writing,
which he duly appreciates, has much
in common with his own; while
Katherine Mansfield, whom also he
appreciates, rightly finding her New
Zealand stories by far her best, is
still further away.
These essays, and the concluding one
on “Three Journalists” —the Goncourt
Brothers, Jules Renard and Paul
Leautaud —all contain a great deal of
sound criticism expressed not only
lucidly but, allowing for a certain
acidity, entertainingly. Maugham
approaches literary criticism essentially
as a novelist, and it is always the
personality of the writer, as much as
the quality of his writing, which
interests him. When, as he does here,
he strikes the proper balance between
biography and criticism, so that the
anecdotes are neither mere gossip nor
encyclopaedic facts but an illumination
of the work, it makes a singularly read-
able form of criticism; Maugham has
always thought that his writing should
be readable and even, as he repeatedly
asserts, saleable.
Perhaps because of this novelist’s
approach —but also because its subject-
matter is wholly unfamiliar—the most
entertaining of all the essays is not on
a literary subject at all but on an
Indian “saint,” “the Maharsi,” whom
Maugham once met in India and on
approaching whose presence he fainted.
For ever after the saint’s disciples
maintained that Maugham had been
“rapt into the Infinite”; but Maugham
says he just fainted.
The saint, eventually to become so
eminent that Mahatma Gandhi took
cognisance of him, was bom in a
remote village, the son of a sort of
lawyer. Idle at school, he experienced
a great fear of death at the age of 17.
and hastened away to the holy place of
Arunchala to meditate; which, after
living for some years in fearful squalor
and poverty, he did with such success
that crows and squirrels fed from his
hand in his cave, elephants came and
bowed to him and he learned the
language of the monkeys—“ When
there were quarrels between two
groups [of monkeys] they would come
to him and he composed their differ-
ences.”
A New Novelist
Australia needs young novelists—
there is never any shortage of poets
—and it is pleasant to see the Tas-
manian writer Christopher Koch
coming up with his first novel The
Boys in the Island (Hamish Hamilton)
to join the three remarkably promising
books by the Westralian Randolph
Stow.
“The Boys in the Island” is, more-
over, a pretty good novel; as good, in
fact, as anything in its kind you would

Shown above is a battery of five Lysaght 2,000 bushel silos with a V 2814 Grain
Auger centrally situated to fill four silos without moving, making it a one-man
operation. Batteries of this type, filled in this manner, enable you to turn oats
quickly and easily in an emergency. Remember, too, that all fodder conservation
expenses are tax deductible.
At left are two Lysaght 3,500 bushel silos installed at Moree. Such installations
are being rapidly augmented as farmers learn the vital importance of building
up fodder reserves to meet drought conditions. This particular battery, in
fact, by providing low cost supplementary feed for lambing ewes, gave the
owner a full lamb drop the highest ever recorded in his district during a
dry year.
Countless examples exist to prove beyond all doubt that
adequate fodder reserves are vital to modern farming. During
drought periods, for example, oats that had been stored in
Lysaght Silos for up to seven years were used to reduce stock
losses. Being stored when costs were low, the fodder savings
alone more than paid for the silo installation.
Decide today to put Lysaght Grain Silos to work for you!
A Lysaght Field Representative is always available to help and
advise you on the most suitable locations and to assist in the
planning of proven battery layouts, auger installations, etc.

GIVE AND TAKE
nrHE visit of Dr. Subandrio, Foreign
A Minister of Indonesia, has been
treated as a nine-day’s wonder by the
press, which is short on sensations.
It certainly could have important
repercussions, but the affairs of Indo-
nesia are so confused that nobody is
quite sure what they might be.
Relationships with Indonesia have
not been good, in spite of all that the
diplomacy of Mr. Casey can do,
largely because there has been no
stable and independent Administra-
tion, and negotiating with the Gov-
ernment sometimes has been like
negotiating with a handful of loose
sand. /
The Government exists Because it
has compromised with all sections
capable of exerting influence, one at
a time, according to who seems
strongest for the moment. This has
been a policy of expediency, dictated
by pressing circumstances; but it is
very disconcerting to an outside world,
since sometimes the Government has
looked to be entirely in the hands of
the Communists and sometimes in
that of the Army, which, saved it
from the effects of rebellion, but which
at the same time seems to have felt
itself forced to establish a sort of
military dictatorship in return for the
protection which it gives the Govern-
ment against its internal enemies.
Undoubtedly there are areas of the
scattered islands, and in the richest
parts of them, too, that are out of
Government control except insofar as
the Government is able to prevent
them from direct aggression.
The condition of the large industrial
centres is advertised by Dr. Subandrio’s
own admission on arrival in Australia
that he is unable to assess the Com-
munist strength in his country because
of the restraint exercised over political
parties by the Army. But there is no
doubt that the Communist party is the
strongest and most closely knit
organised body in the islands and that
it is playing the same game as in Cairo,
Baghdad and other Oriental centres —
the game of disruption leading to revo-
lutionary capture of power by an
Administration in which concealed
Red-ants direct policy, pending trans-
fer to Communist rule.
It is to the Communist interest to
keep the population in a ferment
internally and to breed as many
animosities and suspicions as possible
against the Western world.
TAR. SUBANDRIO’S visit came
1-7 immediately after a drift from the
Communist allegiance, which seemed
so marked a few months ago, partly
following the imposition of a con-
servative policy by the Army and partly
because it became to be realised that
Moscow’s “smooth” policy was not
aimed at the consolidation of the new
country but at its disruption.
The fruit of this and of Army influ-
ence has been the agreement with the
United States to supply arms (not very
modern and mostly suitable for internal
pacification) to help stabilise the
regime and suppress the elements of
dissidence.
- The fact that immediately this
agreement was achieved a noisy cam-
paign began to create the impression
that invasion of Western New Guinea
was imminent shows that if the Com-
munists and/or rebels in Indonesia
have not overriding power, they com-
mand access to the sections of the
world’s press which are always ready
to make mischief on a whispered hint
from anti-Western sources. There is
no real evidence that there was the
slightest basis for the alarmist rumors,
while commonsense is likely to dis-
count them as absurd at this juncture.
It is not by any means clear what
specific objective Dr. Subandrio has
in Australia save that he wants to be
friends and that his coming appears to
be part of a general lossening-up of
attitude. This is manifested also in
relationships with the United States
and with the Dutch, who have now
been encouraged to hint that they are
ready to resume negotiations with the
Indonesians in all issues, including
West New Guinea.
It is just as well that the negotiations
in Canberra, whatever they are, are
carried on at this stage behind closed
doors, for every anti-Western agitator
will be only too eager to torpedo
any plan which will bring Australia
and Indonesia closer together in trade
and defence.
The visitor has been careful to say
that Indonesia will not consider a
mutual-defence treaty, though he
seems ready to agree to joint defence-
exercises similar to those carried out
with India and Pakistan under condi-
tions suitable to his Government.
At the same time he obviously wants
something important. An official of
his Ministry has said that the visit
“must be at least a partial success or
there will be difficulties here,” and the
Indonesian press—or the part of it that
is free to speak its mind—has a
threatening tone, and hints that if he
does not get what he wants, Australian-
Indonesian relationships will take a
turn for the worse.
They could not have been much
worse at times than they have been
at the Indonesian end, and Australia
will certainly welcome any move to
better them and to bring about accord
in keeping with Dr. Subandrio’s
appraisement that “Australia and
Indonesia are bound together by fate.”
The two countries undoubtedly are,
and the Australian official viewpoint
has always recognised this fact. It
has recognised that a weak Indonesia
is a temptation to the Communist bloc;
that the defences of Australia, New
Guinea and Indonesia are integral.
The Commonwealth Government has
used every resource at its disposal both
to help the Indonesians to consolidate
and achieve stable and constitutional
Government and higher standards of
thought and action, and it has ignored
a great deal in Indonesian relation-
ships that Russia certainly would not
have ignored.
It is essential that Dr. Subandrio
should understand that there can be
no good relationships without give
and take, and a recognition that acts
and policies of goodwill, permanent in
Australia, shall be matched equally in
Indonesia.
A USTRALIA has a huge potential in
the resources which could help
Indonesia stabilise itself: in consumer
goods, in knowhow, and in markets for
Indonesian products.
The opportunity to be generous now
seems to have arrived, provided Dr.
Subandrio does not come to ask the
impossible. The new American-
Indonesian relations are encouraging.
Everything within the power of the
Commonwealth should be done to aid
Indonesian leaders who are sincere in
trying to establish an independent
national policy, general law and order
throughout the islands and an improved
standard of living and education.
In return it is reasonable to ask that
Indonesia is not made a Communist
base for the ultimate conquest of Aus-
tralia and that Australians, when they
go there on business or pleasure, are
treated as they would expect to be
treated in civilised countries—always
allowing that in its present twilight
period the Government cannot always
control its supporters. It is to be hoped
that the visit of the Foreign Minister
to Canberra is the first step in the
direction of a permanent and friendly
co-operation.


"AND YOU, YOU BRUTE?"


PLAIN ENGLISH
New Era
When this is published the new Federal.
Parliament will be assembling at Can-
berra and the world will know who has
been selected to lead Federal Labor out
of what Mr. Ward describes as “a
disastrous situation.” The decision has
scarcely more than an academic interest,
since it was clear from the beginning that
whoever became the leader would merely
have the loyalty of a section behind him
and that he would pursue his course with
internal enemies lurking in every corner
of the caucus-room and waiting to pull
him down.
Labor had hoped to face the new
Parliament with the ability to recur to
its election prophecies of mounting un-
employment, recession and disaster which
could be loaded on to the shoulders of
the Menzies Government.
But time and circumstance have
destroyed the hope. The return of the
Government has been followed by some
upturn in wool prices, an influx of capital
from overseas which, though State
Governments are apt to take credit for
it, is largely due to the stability of free-
enterprise Federal Government and the
assurance in the result of the elections
that any investing capitalist from outside
will not within the next few years find
himself subject to dismemberment of
his enterprise at the behest of Socialist
ratbags in the juntas within the A.L.P.
and the Communist -bloc of unionism.
The Parliament which meets this week
marks an era, because of the passing-on
of key figures like Sir Arthur Fadden,
whose absence to Canberra at least means
what the loss of the post-office clock
meant to Sydney. It meets with Mr.
McEwen stronger and more influential
than before, and with a back-bench
thirsting to use its numbers in direction
of policy. Already some of them have
been at work, including R. C. Wheeler,
whose attack on the Development Bank
conception is embarrassing to the
Government.
The full programme of the Govern-
ment will not be evident from the
Governor-General’s speech, but much of
it will. The session will have as a
limbering-up exercise the resubmission
of the banking bills. And it will be sur-
prising if it gets through the year with-
out a showdown on defence, which needs
a heavy Parliamentary combing-over.
The findings of the committee which
last year reviewed the Constitution will
certainly come up for consideration in
detail before the current Parliament is
out, though the Government may wait
till the State elections are over and it
sees whether it can deal with the matter
in conjunction with six State Govern-
ments of its own color before it brings
the question forward. Many of the pro-
posed reforms could be got by agreement
with the States if Mr. Cahill and Mr.
Hawke are defeated. Certainly the con-
trol of union ballots to prevent Com-
munist manipulation, together with a
national roads and railway policy, are
in the offing if all the States go Liberal-
Country party.
The whole set-up of government will
change with the suction of depart-
mental heads to Canberra in the next
three years, and will form a landmark
in Australian evolution if external condi-
tions permit.
Another Road Casualty
[From Canberra]
The much-publicised National Roads
Conference called in Canberra last week
turned out to be a squib.
All it did was to provide an outlet
for pressure - groups in the automotive
industry to let-off steam and reiterate
their demands for more Commonwealth
finance to reconstruct and extend what
is admittedly a shocking highway system
in Australia.
The States, through their representa-
tives at the conference, also jumped the
bandwagon, cried poor mouth, and said
if anything was to be done the Common-
wealth would have to foot the bill.
It was not hard to discern that an
election was looming in almost every
State represented.
Despite all the wailing, Common-
wealth Transport Minister Shane
Paltridge refused to be stampeded and
told the conference that increased Com-
monwealth allocations meant only one
thing—higher taxation, either applied to
the already hard-hit motoring section of
the community or to the community
generally.
He refused to budge on the question
of granting to the States for road pur-
poses that share of the petrol tax —about
32 per cent. —which the Commonwealth
retains for its own revenue purposes.
Paltridge added that there were very
real difficulties in the way of the Gov-
ernment, in a time of deficit-budgeting
(£llO million this year), finding further
large sums of money for roads or any
other purpose.
“I feel that I should say that quite
candidly.”
Suggestions put before the conference
revealed divergent opinions, even
in the automotive industry as a whole,
and between various State Governments
and other authorities.
Differing estimates on the cost of pro-
viding Australia with a first-class system
of major State highways were almost
unbelieveable.
But there is one glimmer of hope. It
is possible that as a result of the exchange
of views over the conference-table the
Commonwealth and the State Premiers at
their special meeting next month may
get down to tintacks and devise some
plan for what is quickly becoming a
national emergency.
Renshaw Goes Into Reverse
Division of a municipality into wards is
an old and generally commendable
feature of local-government. Its chief
virtue is that individual aldermen and
councillors represent subdivisions of the
municipality and can speak with intimate
knowledge of the problems of their own
wards, thqs giving local-government a
truly local character.
But there are suspicious features about
the proposals announced by N.S.W.
Local Government Minister Renshaw to
restore the ward-system to the Sydney
City Council. Six years ago, under the
aegis of the same Minister, the wards
were abolished and a system designed to
keep the council under A.L.P. control
was substituted. With the rise of the
D.L.P. this system —proportional-repre-
sentation, with the whole municipality as
one electorate—no longer guarantees
Labor dominance, and last year the
Labor majority on the council decided
to ask for wards again.
There is no suggestion that the new
proposal is intended to correct a mistake
made six years ago. The Labor sponsors
of the plan don’t admit that the 1953
decision was a mistake. It worked at
the time for the good of Labor, as it
was intended to, and as the new plan is
now intended to.
Following the example set by Premier
Cahill, his predecessor as Ministerial head
of the department, Renshaw has been
responsible for scores of decisions
designed to reduce the number and
increase the size of local-government
areas. To a large extent the effect of
these decisions has been to reduce the
local element in local-government.
Reintroduction of wards in Sydney
City Council reverses this process. Why?
When Renshaw introduced the bill to
abolish the wards in 1953 he praised the
system he was introducing. Now he’s
scrapping it. Why?
The proposed wards will not be the
same as those abolished in 1953. Their
boundaries were drawn by Labor aider-
men. There’s no need to ask “why?”
N.S.W. Opposition-leaders Morton and
Hughes have promised, if elected, to
appoint a commission to consider local-
government boundary changes. They
should add that one of its first jobs will
be to determine ward-boundaries for
Sydney City Council.
Mr. Kramer Directs
[From “Collins Street”]
A current Broadway musical success is
“Say, Darling,” the result of the fascina-
tion of the author with what went on
backstage when he saw his novel being
made into what turned out to be a smash-
hit musical, “The Pajama Game.”
Obviously the sequence might well be
unending.
The possibilities of at least a play —
the musical score might come next, before
the film and the film musical—about the
reaction of a substantial section of Mel-
bourne’s population, all its press and
most of its TV and radio organisation
to the filming of Nevil Shute's successful
book, On the Beach, are equally clear.
From the announcement last May that
two Hollywood executives were in Mel-
bourne planning sets and scenes, followed


by the breathless announcement in July
that Ava Gardner, Gregory Peck and
Fred Astaire would actually come to
Melbourne to act in the film, tension
mounted.
It was heightened (or fanned) in
August by the news that Ava, Greg and
Fred wanted houses, and they were
offered by the score ; it later developed
that Stanley Kramer, who is the pro-
ducer and key man in the whole shebang,
also wanted a house, but the Kramer
family’s needs got only a belated mention.
The Kramer family squeezed into a
six-bedroom crib, with almost as much
entertaining-space, near the Mentone
beach, and the fierce, white light turned
on the building of sets, the sites, the
beaches, the farms (accompanied by
histories of the farms) and the lucky Mel-
burnians who may become extras —any-
thing or anybody who may become
hallowed by the tread or touch or look
of Ava.
They arrived like a vaudeville-bill,
building-up. First Fred, minus white tie
and tails, on January 5 ; then Greg, look-
ing remarkably human (he had always
seemed to me, no matter how he was
cast, to be playing “The Man in the
Mask”), with his wife the next day ; and
then, with the crescendo of whirring and
clicking, followed Ava.
Ava retreated smartly to her service-
fiat, but her first appearance the next
day, an hour late for her scheduled time
on the set, made the front-pages, the
radio spot-news and TV, and somehow
the old Hollywood roundabout was on:
the arrival of an Italian admirer, a flight
to Sydney to have *a quiet chat with
Tony Trabert ; and the disclosure in inter-
views that she was really a homebody
who would rather be back on Daddy’s
farm. The Hollywood Line never alters.
The arms of both Federal and State
Governments moved protectingly around
the circus. The Navy produced H.M.S.
Andrew, done-over to look atomic, and
loaned H.M.A.S. Melbourne ; and the
police hovered paternally around Ava’s
Rolls-Bentley and Dame Mabel Brookes’s
big house in Domain Road, South Yarra,
where, it was reported, autograph-
hunters (waiting for Greg) were at the
gates and a burglar was inside.
Thousands turned-up at Canadian
Bay ( a pebbly and secluded beach which
the Two Hollywood Executives had been
misguided enough to believe would be
quiet) for the beach scenes, at Frankston
station, and crowds followed them to
the country at Berwick and wherever else
they moved.
Finally, for the filming of the ruined
city in Lonsdale Street on a deserted
Sunday, no fewer than 66 police were
required to keep back the onlookers,
although only Greg was appearing in the
litter purposefully cast round by the
scene-setters ; and the Rev. Dr. C. Irving
Benson, who is at least one of the city’s
most articulate clergymen, was moved to
protest that the crowds were so thick
churchgoers were hindered from getting
into Wesley.
The matter even reached Spring Street,
and to the Chief Secretary’s bland com-
ment that the police were merely helping,
the Labor rejoinder was that they looked
as if they, too, were being directed by
Mr. Kramer.
Any competent playwright could
thread a pleasant boy-meets-girl romance
against this background ; the song-titles
and inspirations for ballet are limitless.
Solution in Cyprus?
After years of cruel, indiscriminate
bloodshed and retaliatory executions of
the terrorists, the Greek section of
the Cypriot population has apparently
agreed to a plan which it would have
scorned a year or two ago. Even
Makarios, the archbishop whose palace
was used as a bomb-store and who
appears to have been party to the most
un-Christian terrorism —if not the
planner of some of it —allegedly has
agreed.
The talks began in Zurich. The partici-
pants were, at that stage, Menderes, the
Turkish Prime Minister; Karamanlis,
the Greek Prime Mmister; Averoff, the
Greek Foreign Minister ; and Zorlu, the
Turkish Foreign Minister. The meeting
was called jointly, each side taking great
care to avoid having responsibility for
the initiative.
The British were not there, but
characteristically, and in the manner
that makes Russians and others think
them fools, were engaged in awarding
compensation to a couple of Cypriots
whose relatives, after the murder of
Mrs. Cutliffe, a middle-aged wife of a
British sergeant who was killed by
terrorists while peacefully doing her
shopping in the presence of her daughter,
became the victims of “some degree of
force used on those who were arrested
which was not justified.” They apparently
were the victims of the outraged and
long-suffering comrades of the husband
of the murdered woman, and died as the
result of their injuries.
The agreement is by no means sealed
and delivered. Its reported details look
unreal. Cyprus to become an independent
republic instead of part of Greece. Its
Parliament is to consist of members in
proportion to racial numbers of the popu-
lation, which means that the Greeks must
always be in a considerable majority and
the Turks, whom they hate, at their
mercy. It is not clear whether the island
would remain in the British Common-
wealth, but British troops and defence
facilities would remain there —for the
present. Greece and Turkey would also
have troops in the island. And it is
suggested, on top of this, that Makarios,
the arch-prophet of enosis with Greece,
should be the first head of the State.
There has been recently a massing
of troops in Bulgaria, and Communist
activity both inside and outside-Yugo-
slavia directed at Tito has been marked
in the past few weeks.
It has been suggested that the Turks
and the Greeks are hurriedly settling
their differences prior to the conclusion
of an Eastern Mediterranean defence
pact, for which the Turks would be all
the more eager in view of what has hap-
pened to the Baghdad Pact. Both would
be anxious to have British bombers and
fighters, rocket-batteries and missile-
batteries in Cyprus.
The further conferences in London
this week should show definitive results
—provided the Cypriots are ready to
agree to them, which remains to be seen.
It Wasn't Cricket, Sir!
[From Canberra]
Prime Minister R. G. Menzies was so
impressed with Indonesia’s visiting
Foreign Minister, Doctor Subandrio, that
he invited him to be his guest at the
opening day’s play in the fifth Test at
Melbourne last Friday.
Subandrio felt it was a Royal com-
mand and couldn’t refuse, so he accepted,
even though he knows as much about
cricket as the P.M. does about Indonesian
hockey.
The P.M.’s gesture was undoubtedly
sincere, as he confided to his colleagues
what a splendid impression Subandrio had
made on him, but, nevertheless. President
Soekarno’s emissary was embarrassed, to
say the least. Still, a good diplomat
should be capable of remaining diplo-
matic even when put to the Test.
Despite this small, almost unknown
incident, Dr. Subandrio’s visit was a
personal triumph for him and seemed
to do something to clear the air between
Australia and its nearest neighbor.
Dr. Subandrio neverthe.ess made it
quite clear that irrespective of Australia’s
attitude, Indonesia would never relin-
quish its claim to sovereignty over Dutch
(West) New Guinea.
At the same time, he made it equally
clear Indonesia would never use force to
achieve its objective.
Shrewdly, he sounded a note which
some of the big Powers could follow
when he sa : d the use of force to press
territorial claims had never been success-
ful even when adopted by major world
Powers.
Wool for China
[From Canberra]
Once Communist China acquired suffi-
cient plant to scour wool, Australian
sales of greasy wool to the Chinese
Mainland would increase vastly, and
China might rival Japan as Australia’s
best customer in greasy wool.
This is the opinion of trade experts,
following their talks with members of
the 12-man trade-mission which recently
toured the East in the trade-ship Delos.
Dp to the present, China has dealt
mainly in processed wools, and taken
very little greasy wool, indicating that
although it was becoming more indus-
trialised, China still did not have suffi-
cient plant to scour wool.
Once this difficulty was overcome the
potential for wool sales would be
tremendous.

“Stromlo”: When Prof. J. G. Hayden,

that weaker beer would be an important
factor in reducing alcoholism, millions
of beer-drinkers thirsted for his blood,
and the breweries bellowed that alcoholic
content was a major factor in preserving
beer. The temperance unions said they
didn’t want anything of the sort —they
wanted total abstinence, no less. Beer,
as everyone knows, is water with addi-
tive ; any attempts to reduce the addi-
tive would probably augment the ranks
of neat-water drinkers.

“Mac Hoots”: We hear enough about

they have in understanding each other?
It was in a cafe in Mittagong (N.S.W.),
where their full sorrows were brought
home to me. The four Nordic-type cus-
tomers each ordered a strangely frugal
meal of a plate of chips ; so the small
Greek boy very naturally brought them
four plates of chops (with chips). But
the chaps didn’t want chops, they wanted
chips (which they lucidly pronounced
sheeps)', so the poor boy ran out very
chapfallen to the kitchen, and the pro-
prietor came out with a chop on his
shoulder I mean a chip and asked
them what they meant by chopping and
changing their order ; and, anyhow, in
the end they got their chips, which was
just as well, for I don’t think they had
enough chips for chops.

This leafy day of drunken summer
Greengrocer and Orange Drummer,
Yellow Monday and Cherry Nose
The moment that the sun rose
To make the air more hot than heat
To burn our ears, your beat, drum, beat
Began, and now the evening’s here
You, drunkards, stagger down the air
In long glissades from branch to ground
With spurts of agitated sound,
Until, in dark and noisy night
A Black Prince plummets to the light,
Comes whirring through the kitchen door,
Skitters across the polished floor,
And on my hand is drumming long
Like any sot who loves his song . . .
Might then, the true word set him free
From some strange heat-dazed sorcery?
And Margery, you child of fable,
See standing by this very table
A prince indeed?
We’ll end his spree
In the safe liquid-amber tree —
Some things are better left unknown
Lest, once the exorcism's shown
Not only prince but Cherry Nose or
Orange Drummer and Greengrocer
Come clamoring, and who would wish
A Yellow Monday in the flesh? . . .
Then let us leave this tipsy air
And cool in sober sleep, my dear.

“Dorian”: Once a year our church
holds a harvest festival service, when
everything from tinned fruit to sweet-corn
is delicately arranged on two trestle-
tables near the choir-stalls later tne
stuff is distributed to deserving bodies.
Thus, after evensong, strong youths strip
the tables of their magnificence —leaving
only, in this case, two watermelons, one
large, one small. Apparently it’s a tradi-
tion that the choir shares a watermelon
after evensong; anyway, it being a
warm day, some of the sopranos took
French-leave from the morning service
and went swimming. But they were there
in the evening, and sang lustily, no doubt
eyeing the 361 b. lump of melon. After-
wards, the choir hastily repaired to the
hall ... the organist, through necessity,
played on ; by the time he’d got out of
his robes and over to the hall only a
small slice of melon remained. Still, one
has to be grateful for small mercies, and
it was interesting to see how magically
the choir doubled, almost trebled its
numbers just before the hand-out.

from 8.30 a.m. to 6 p.m., with three days
each week, including Saturday, to 10 p.m.
—weekly remuneration, 10s. On the
10 p.m. days we got sixpence for tea-
money. We found that it paid to spend
threepence on a light “shandy” and dine
on counter-lunches. One of the chaps
had a wide knowledge of the range and
nature of counter-lunches served in city
hotels, as well as when and where special
items such as fried fish and hot sausages
could be obtained. We ate well and made
a profit of threepence each work-night.

“Bo": Once a fine, fat, healthy product
of the vegetable-world, the power-line
pole on the grass-footpath outside my
home first showed signs of pre-
mature senility some years ago.
From time to time teams of pole-
physicians and -surgeons from the
local council would come and ponder
on the patient’s malady and hold long
consultations, ah extended course of in-
jections and minor amputations usually
following. Thereafter their arboreal
victim was never the same. It increasingly
developed splits, shakes, knots, spots,
dilberries, wet feet and dry-rot —all of


which necessitated further amputations,
whilst the additional injection-holes gave
it, for about 4ft. up, the appearance
of a wooden colander. Lately the patient
took a dramatic turn for the worse.
Although an amateur, I think I may
modestly claim that my diagnosis of
galloping-consumption was accurate, the
consumers being the best-fed colony of
termites I’ve seen. By the time the next
team turned-up rigor mortis was setting-in
fast; but, blithely-confident of effecting
a last-minute cure, they decided on more
drastic surgery, so that now the pole’s
circumference has been reduced to a
size that would make Sabrina’s waist
look like an alderman’s embonpoint.
As well, they cunningly selected a day
on which a strong nor’-easter was blow-
ing so that the creosote with which they
generously sprayed it would blow straight
on to the shade-tree which for eight years
I have been assiduously nurturing, and
kill three-quarters of it. It must have
cost ’em the best part of £lOO to reduce
that pole to the wreck it is. I can only
hope that when it does drop dead it won’t
fall on me as I’m mowing around it.

“Spin”: That Canberra lass who, when

said she’d never heard of anyone playing
bowls in Canberra (B. 28/1/’59) was
getting away from the point. Proof-
reading the by-laws of a W.A. country
bowling club I struck two references to
bowling in 50 inches of type. The laws
throughout related to the minimum age
for members (21), hours during which
the club would remain open, restrictions
on visitors and privileges which could
legally be extended to them, the making
of honorary or temporary members, etc.
“Can you Wangle our photos into
tomorrow's ‘Herald’?”
Did you know that in these establish-
ments a visitor’s name must be on the
notice-board for something like ten
minutes before he can become a member,
under the meaning of the act, for the
(Sunday) afternoon?
“Paddy”: Afraid “Pat” (B. 28/l/’59)
didn’t really want that game of bowls he
didn’t get in Canberra. A taxi would
have taken him from any Canberra pub
to the nearest bowling-club for a few
bob, and a phone-call to any of the four
clubs would have brought a member and
car to the pub : door in a minute or two.

“We live in a world in which the odd and

Radio speaker.
We'd nod hoist a brow
Were a monarch to bow
And step backwards when leaving his

If some hairy-legged bloke
Gave up training a moke
To pursue a career in the ballet;
Some Rumanian proclaim
That his family-name
Didn’t have as its tail-end an “escu”;
Or that some Alpine guide
His skill had applied
A snow-bound St. Bernard to rescue.
All surprise we avoid
When some planners employed
By the Gov’ment turn out to be
botchers;
Or should coves digging hole
In the roadway extoll
The interest and patience of watchers;
We’d not even gape
To be told that an ape
Had painted some saleable pictures;
Or that K., very free
When discussing “that B.”
Might substitute praises for strictures.
No amazement we’d show
Were a raven (or crow)
To sing in a coloratura ;
If a judge were to smile
In benignity, while
He gazed on a sound-sleeping juror;
But the wonderless view
Has its limits. Would you
Not bat an eye, were the nation
To hear that M.P.s
Had turned-down —us to please —
A screw-increase recommendation ?

ON “THE HILL.”
By GEORGE PATTERSON
* < ut you miss all the
i-C drama of the game,”
,1 3 said my friend Charlie
when I told Him I
found it better to watch Test-
cricket on television.
“Drama!” 1 replied. “1 had
enough drama in the early days
of Larwood and the bumpers.”
It was during the Larwood
versus McCabe duel that I was
about to be annihilated when
amidst the uproar 1 expostu-
lated with a gentleman who
kept shouting to the Nawab of
Pataudi, “How do you like it
now, Potato?” Fortunately my
person and dignity were saved
by a powerful companion who
silenced the noisy barracker.
“Oh, well,” said Charlie,
“that’s a long time ago and
things are different today. I
trunk you should try it again
by way of comparison and go
on The Hill for the fun of it.”
So 1 decided to pay one brief
visit in order to settle the issue
of reality versus the synthetic
—so to speak.
While driving-out I had
visions of a nice position on
the grassy hill where I could
not only watch the cricket and
its drama in comfort, but also
enjoy the comments of the
“weird mob.” But when I
entered the ground I stood
aghast at the vast slope of the
hill so tightly packed with
humanity that it was utterly
impossible to pass beyond its
fringe.
In the immediate vicinity, I
discovered scores of enthusiasts
swaying on each side of a
sight-board, and, there being
no alternative, 1 inserted myself
on one side as well as I dared.
Through an occasional chink
in the forest of crew-cuts I saw
the wicket, but none of the
drama on either the “off” or
the “on” sides. I could see
May batting now and then and
heard many shouts of, “Why
don’t you have a go. May?”
1 wriggled to try and see the
drama of Meckiff’s alleged
throwing, but could only hear
some wag yelling, “Why don't
you give Mackay a throw?”
Then the sight-board was
shifted, and the crowd quickly
moved over, and, strangely
enough, without the hostile
comments I had expected.
Suddenly there was a roar
and shouts of, “You beaut!”
and I was informed that May
had been caught. “That was
ravell,” said one of the crew-
cuts, only to be contradicted
by another crew-cut: “Rats, it
was McDonald.” But it was
invisible to me, and I was
becoming eager for some
drama.
Then the game tightened,
and, foolishly, I remarked to
a non-crew-cut who was
jammed against me, “I think
they’ll stay there for the rest
of the afternoon.”
He gave me a suspicious
look and said, “How do you
know?” This seemed an open
invitation to an argument, so
I gazed steadily at the necks
of the crew-cuts as Dexter
came in and was out in a
flash. As he went back to the
pavilion, my suspicious neigh-
bor remarked slyly, “That’s
what you get from too many
parties”; but I ignored the
invitation to argue about it.
Then in came Swetman,
rather undersized in compari-
son with Cowdrey, which
caused one of the crew-cuts
nearby to laugh and remark,
“Gawd, look at the little squirt,
he won’t last long”—a predic-
tion that was to prove false.
As the players stopped for a
drink, two of the “weird mob”
behind me really had an argu-
ment. “There must be fifty-
thousand here today,” said one.
“Oh, break it down, Joe,”
replied the other. “I’ll bet
tnere’s not more than forty-
thousand.” “Want to bet?”
Joe cogitated for a moment,
and then said, “Oh, well, if
you’re going to drag in all
those silvertails up in the
Members’. . .”
But the argument stopped
in its tracks as play resumed,
and “the little squirt” went
quietly on digging-in until sud-
denly the avalanche of
humanity started to erupt as
the players left for afternoon-
tea. Those of us around the
sight-board were swept away in
two streams —one towards the
bar, and the other towards the
exit-gates. I managed to join
the departing throng, and was
hustled out into the street,
stripped of any dignity.
As I crossed the road to
relax in the shade of a Moreton
Bay fig-tree, a large sedan
passed close to me and a huge
lout leaned out of the car and
shouted, “Get off the bloody
road, mug!” It was a fitting
farewell.
A FLYING CLUB
By Shirley M. Stott
'T'hree travellers arrived in
Canberra recently from
Sydney on the first tour
arranged by an aviation club
which plans to extend its tours
overseas in future.
The president of the club, a
seasoned traveller, is just 11
years old.
With him were the club’s
secretary and another member
—also 11 years old.
Twelve months ago young
Barry Campbell, of Blakehurst,
Sydney, and a “school cobber”
decided that more than any-
thing in the world they wanted
to travel and learn about aero-
planes.
They formed a club in the
rumpus-room of Barry’s home
and called it the Junior
Aviation Club. Their aims
were to travel the world and
to do it by aeroplane.
In 12 months the two
founders and four members of
the same age converted the
rumpus-room into a well-
equipped travel-bureau, com-
plete with maps, posters, tele-
phones and office-furniture.
They then declared their
complete independence from
the parental purse —so far as
future travelling-expenses were
concerned and set about
saving for their first trip.
Their arrival in Canberra on
January 7 by an Ansett-ANA
DC3 airliner laden with
pamphlets and maps —meant
the success of their early plans
and the promise that they
would be able to undertake
their more ambitious ones in
the future.
The club secretary, Warren
Ryan, was eager to talk about
the clubrooms of which the
boys were very proud. He said
they had books on nearly every
kind of aircraft, actual flying
models and information and
pictures they had received
from aircraft-companies.
Melbourne is the boys’ next
objective. They said they
would start immediately selling
bottles and papers, mowing
neighbors’ lawns and doing
odd jobs for Dad to raise the
fare for each member.
They hope all six members
of the club will be able to make
the next trip. In fact, they
expected the club to be
inundated with young people
eager to join after the club's
first success.
However, only boys will be
admitted—Barry’s sister is paid
3d. a week to keep little girls
out!
Their first overseas venture
far in the distance but
discussed with much deter-
mination —will be to America.
The boys want to see the latest
“jets” and, of course, Cape
Canaveral.


POLITICAL POINTS
On Sunday night Cahill was asked on
TV of his relations with Evatt. He replied
that he and the Federal leader “got on
splendidly.” He recalled that they had
entered the N. S. Wales Parliament
together in 1925 (Bert was member for
Balmain). “I was on Dr. Evatt’s platform
in his campaign and he will be on mine
in the not-too-distant future.” That will
be good news for the Opposition.
Joe also said that Labor Governments
in Victoria and Queensland had been
defeated because of internal dissensions
which sprang from minor matters and
not matters of principle ; in his State,
Labor factions had been able to recon-
cile their differences. One thing about
the Cahill Government is a safe bet. No
one will ever be able to accuse it of
splitting on a matter of principle.

Dr. Subandrio has every reason to be
pleased with the result of his visit to
Australia, which has produced an under-
taking from the Federal Government not
to oppose any peaceful agreement In-
donesia may make with the Netherlands
on the future of New Guinea. Whether
the Australian people have any reason
to rejoice is another matter. What does
peaceful agreement mean? Does it cover
an agreement, said to be in prospect,
under which Indonesia would release con-
fiscated Dutch assets in Java and Sumatra
in return for the ceding of West New
Guinea? The big stick isn’t as noisy as
cannon and machine-guns, but sometimes
it’s just as powerful.

some break away and some others,

pointments or just plain diseased egotism,

Dentistry at the University of Otago
(N.Z.), said he was puzzled at the attitude
of people who opposed the use of
fluorine:
Many of them have no teeth themselves,
no children and no civic responsibility.
Walsh claims that the dental profession
now knows enough to reduce the inci-
dence of dental decay by three-quarters,
but despite that there was more untreated
decay in Australia than in most of the
so-called underdeveloped countries repre-
sented at the W.H.O. seminar on dental
health which he attended at Adelaide
University. Fluoridation of water-
supplies would help.

[From Canberra]
The end of an era in Australia’s history—the
era of uniform taxation —may be in sight.
Its death-knell may be sounded at a special
Premiers’ Conference, to meet in Canberra on
March 4, 5 and 6.
Prime Minister Menzies has called the con-
ference to discuss the whole complex question
of Commonwealth - State financial relations,
with which he is not happy —a view shared by
some of the States.
Uniform taxation was introduced in 1942 to
give the Commonwealth complete control over
Australia’s finances in time of war. Since then,
the Commonwealth has been unwilling to give
it up, although in recent years Menzies has
become sick of the States’ cry that the Common-
wealth is starving them.
He called their bluff at a Premiers’ Con-
ference in 1957 and offered to hand back taxing-
powers to the States, but the States found
excuses that it could not be done there and
then.
It is quite likely that Menzies will repeat
the offer at the forthcoming conference; this
time the States are reported to be ready for
the move, but there’s a pretty wide divergence
of opinion between them.
The larger States would be willing to take
back the powers, but the smaller States, who
never “have had it so good” as under uniform-
tax, are reluctant to go back to the pre-war
system. At present they receive by way of
tax-reimbursements and special grants much
more money than they could ever hope to raise
themselves.
It may be this difference between the States
that will prevent an end to uniform-tax; but
if the States can agree on a pattern under
which all States would be as well off as they
are now, uniform-taxation will soon be a thing
of the past.
ANOTHER TRANSPORT DILEMMA


In the sparring that went on for a
week before the scheduled Evatt-Ward
contest for the right to save the Labor
party Arthur Calwell took the concilia-
tory line of let’s-be-friends-and-not-
criticise-each-other. Calwell has his own
recipe for saving the party and it doesn’t
include the leadership or either Evatt or
Ward. A few years ago he made an
attempt himself to toss the Doc, but it
didn’t come off.
Back in Good Ben Chifley’s Golden
Days the friendship of Ward and Calwell
seemed like unto that of David and
Jonathan. At election-time Eddie would
go down to Melbourne to tell the electors
how fortunate they were to have such a
wonderful bloke for their member, and
Arthur would venture into the wilds of
East Sydney for a reciprocal scratch of
Eddie’s back. But today? Well, maybe
they still love each other, but if so, they
dissemble it very well.

Although it is true the hot spell in
Victoria killed a percentage of some
poultry flocks, that the flush laying-season

Surely the time has arrived when the
Federal Government should take a look
at the large and lovely areas it controls
around Sydney Harbor, with the idea
of releasing portion at least for park-

at North Head, for example, has not
been used for its intended purpose since
World War 11, and could well be trans-
ferred elsewhere, perhaps to Botany Bay.
Now it is proposed to set-up a detention
centre for deportees in the area —one of
the loveliest in the Harbor.

Brisbane, with a present population of

its influence when the numbers are

More than 500 British and European

and present economic and social status
of migrants, to survey the structure of
migrant families, and to examine the
pattern of migrant adjustments to cultural
and social life in their communities. The
task will be done by Professor W. D.
Borrie and Dr. J. Zubryzycki, who
selected the Valley because it is highly
industrialised, and has the highest con-
centration of migrants in Australia.

A note from Adelaide “Advertiser’s”
“Fifty Years Ago” column: “Fifteen
hotels to be closed in Port Adelaide
district.” It was round about that time
that a big delicensing drive reduced the
number of hotels in most Australian
States. This was done in the interests of
temperance-reform. There were 3023
hotels in N.S.W. in 1905 ; when the
Maxwell report was prepared in 1954 the
number was 2028, although in the mean-
time the population of the State had
much more than doubled. Over the same
period the annual consumption of beer
increased from nine gallons a head to
24 gallons a head.
The inference to be drawn is that re-
duction in the number of licences has
benefited only the publicans. The people
are drinking more beer and there are
fewer Bungs to whack-up the beer-money.

The future for Spring Street, Mel-

“Stromlo”: Some religions insist on a
tithe from their faithful. A recent tax-
review case showed that a clergyman of
one such organisation, on a salary of
£1231 a year, had claimed his tithe of
£123 as a tax-deduction, regarding it as
a compulsory payment exacted by the
church as a condition of his continuing
employment. The commissioner dis-
allowed the claim because it was not
business expenditure, did not arise out of
the performance of duties as a minister,
and was income applied after earning and
not an expense in earning it. The board
of appeal upheld the commissioner. It
said the tithe was like that paid by any
other follower of his' church’s teaching,
and took its nature from his individual
compliance with the obligation and duty
taught by the church as the obligation
resting upon him as one of its members.

According to a U.N. demographic
report, the world’s population has in-
creased by 90 million in the last two

expected to be reached in 1962. Only
15 years later the total should reach
4000 million and by the end of the
century, 6000 million—always supposing
there hasn’t been a modern-type war and
that there’s standing-room left on the
planet and any adjacent satellites and

“Mugga Way”: Liberal rank-and-filers

a similar belief among the Conservatives
in Britain —but a Labor member, R.
Crossman, recently went on record as
talking of the “successful build-up cam-
paign of the publicity experts at Tory
headquarters”; he compared it favorably
with American efforts. Dr. Gallup, the

Line has described the new vessel as “the
white hope of Australia’s coastal-shipping

likely to be £6 a head for the trip, plus
£25 to £3O for a car, and there will be
popular amenities. In the meantime, eight
of the Line’s ships of the River class are
lying in mothballs at a cost of about
£250 a week each ; they’re now too big

“Wulworra”: Though “burdened”
with a notable father and brother, Hamil-

own performances. His father was eminent
ethnologist R. H. Mathews, and his brother,
who died at 73 in 1949, was Gregory M.
Mathews, author of a great work on the birds
of Australia. Born at Deepwater (N.S.W.),
Hamilton Mathews went to The King’s School
and Sydney University, was a private surveyor
and, later, Surveyor-General of N.S.W. from
1926-37. One of the side-issues of that job
was official-trusteeship of the Australian
Museum; then for another 13 years he was
president of that institution —only recently he
passed it over to Wallace Wurth, chairman of
N.S.W. Public Service Board. Surveying and
museumship aside, Mathews’s abiding interests
were the Presbyterian Church (session-clerk at
St. Stephens, Macquarie Street, for 11 years) and
Freemasonry. He was a Past Grand Master in
N.S.W., and at the age of 82 wrote the com-
prehensive article on Freemasonry in the Aus-

ABORIGINALITIES
VI7HILE dismissing the absurd state-
* * ment that Australia’s aborigines
reached this continent a million years
ago, “Bass” (B. 4/2/’59) himself over-
states the case by mentioning 30,000
years. The latest authoritative pro-
nouncement on the point, made by
Sydney professors A. N. Burkitt and
N. W. G. Macintosh in the new Austra-
lian Encyclopaedia, puts the approximate
period of the abo.’s arrival at a mere
12,000 years ago. What's more, the two
profs.’ views don't coincide with “Bass’s”
belief that early man exterminated the
Tasmanian-wolf and -devil from the
mainland and may have assisted in
wiping-out the diprotodon—they say that
fossil-remains in Australia present no
evidence of human contact and very little
“ That's the last time he'll put his head in MY mouth!"
evidence of contact with the dingo. It
would appear, therefore, that animals
which are now fossils had just about
vanished from the local scene when man
and his dog arrived. As for the Tas-
manian aborigine, Burkitt and Macintosh
remain uncertain about both his place
of origin and time of arrival. However,
they dispute the idea that the Tasmanian
travelled through the Australian conti-
nent, preferring instead the theory that
he represented a separate race which came
by boats or rafts from islands to the
north-east of Australia. —“Wulworra.”

“G.S.”: The imported Indian and
Senegal turtledoves have nested freely in
my Perth suburb this year, and I’ve kept
a number of nests under observation. In
every case the brood contained two
chicks, and before they were fully fledged
they more than occupied the flimsy nest.
But (again in every case) a few days
before they could think about flying one
disappeared. Could have been taken by
a marauder; but, then, surely in one
case at least, both would have gone. I’m
more inclined to think the nest just isn't
suitable for housing two chicks . . . just
another example of survival of the fittest.

“Bollygum”: Who says Christmas-
bush flowers have no scent (B.
10/12/’58)? My trees at Beecroft

“Justin Thyme”: Ash for damper (B.
28 /1 / ’59)? I once lived alongside a
stock-route at a favorite spot for drovers’
camps, and from one of their cooks I
learnt to make a damper. His instruc-
tions agreed with those of E.V. Stevens,
plus the advice that yarran or yellow-
box gave the best ash and added an
unmistakable flavor to the sod. Years
later I found that cooks in the N.S.W.-
western Riverina, swore by mallee-root
as providing the champion ash. 1 tried
it. It certainly provides heat and a
specially fine ash, but I missed the tang
of my old friend the yarran.

“Kelms”: “Bogaduck” has sound sup-
port for his contention that the songs
of the reed-warbler and the European
nightingale are almost identical (B.

man known to have rowed up the Swan
River, was in the vicinity of where Perth
is now, one of his men wrote in a diary
that they heard the nightingale. Appa-
rently they didn’t see the bird ; but no
one who has heard the two songsters
would doubt that Vlaming's nightingale
was our reed-warbler.

Tucker” (B. 24/12/’5B) “Duke” Tritton
tells of pickers-up throwing the fleece
skin-side up on the wool-table. Now,
in all the N.S.W. sheds I’ve toiled in,
from the Riverina to Bourke, the fleece
has always gone skin-side down. This
makes it simpler for the wool-rollers to
skirt it, remove obvious burr or dirt, and
roll it ready for the classer, who always
receives the fleeces skin-side out.

“Bogaduck”: As one who in his early
days sewed some 50,000 bags of wheat,
barley and oats, and who had a financial
interest in seeing that each held as much
as possible, I can assure “Gravel-
snatcher” (B. 31/12/’5B) that only a man
strong in the back but weak in the head
would get three bushels into the bag by
gripping the two top corners, lifting it a
few inches and dumping it back on the
ground a few times. I began by spread-
ing the sacks on the ground in the hot
sun, thus ensuring that the material
stretched a little when the grain went in.
Before sewing each sack I took a pick-
handle, thrust it small-end first down each
side behind the seam, then raised it an
inch at a time with a ramming-motion,
to force the grain into both comers at
the bottom and to pack it tightly in the
rest of the sack. As a result, when I

delivered those bags of wheat at the
siding they scaled at from 1901 b. to 2001 b.
I abandoned the pick-handle when the
galvanised-iron pipe with a funnel at the
top came on the market. This was thrust
down behind the seams in the same way,
filled with wheat and raised with a
similar ramming-action. It was almost
too efficient. If used too vigorously it
could burst the bag. Further, if more
than 2001 b. was put into a sack with its
aid, the extra wheat was a loss to the

grower—the buyers never wrote more
than 200 on a sack, because wheat-
lumpers would refuse to handle an over-
weight bag.

Jane Williams: “Duke” Tritton’s Syrian
Mary (B. 4/2/’59) used to call on us
twice a year at Wallerawang (N.S.W.),
and I never remember her having more
than one bundle, which she carried on
her head. It must have been good for
posture ; she was straight as a ramrod
and walked like a queen. Mary always
stayed to tea and dossed-down on the
back veranda. She’d be gone at daybreak,
and invariably left a present for the
children.

“Bass”: Have just seen a reference in
a school text-book to the reefs known
as Houtman’s Abrolhos, lying parallel
to the west coast of W.A. and about 30
miles off it. The Dutch commander
Houtman found them in 1619, and they
were named after him and some rather
similar shoals off the Brazilian coast.
The generally - accepted explanation of
their naming, repeated in the text-book,
is that the word corresponds roughly
with Spanish seamen’s interpretation of
the Portuguese words abre olhos —“open
your eyes.” I thought that theory
had been exploded. Investigations by a
member of the W.A. Historical Society
show that the Brazilian shoals were
named by the Portuguese with a word
in their language meaning “spiked
obstructions.” The mistake arose from
the similarity between that word and
the other phrase, and it’s been per-
petuated for over 300 years. Mightn’t
be a bad scheme to have the point
clarified officially.
“Justin Thyme”: “Duke” Tritton in
“Time Means Tucker” (B. 14/1/’59) men-
tions mine host, Sid Norris, of Cullen-
bone. Sid, or “Wingie” as he was
generally known, was one of three
brothers, all lacking limbs. He was minus
an arm, lost in an accident. His brother
Jim, of Cobborah, also an hotelkeeper,
had a leg missing, whereas the youngest,
“No Arm” Norris, a farmer of Tallewang,
was born just as the name says. He
declined the tempting offers of side-
show proprietors and capably ran
his mixed farm. He rode his horse
with the reins about his neck and
worked his plough - horses in similar
fashion. He smoked a pipe which he
filled by nudging it in a shirt pocket
filled with tobacco. But he could light
it only with his boots off, holding the
matchbox (wax in those days) in the toes
of one foot and the match to be lit in
the toes of his other foot, capping the
whole strange performance by applying
match to pipe.
* * * *
“Kate”: Despite large printed notices
—“Dumping rubbish here is prohibited.
Trespassers will be prosecuted”—several
vacant blocks of land in one of Mel-
bourne’s newer building-areas are piled
high with rubbish. Among them one
block stands clear. It has one small hand-
written notice that reads: “Please. do not
dump your rubbish here. Thanks, mate! ”
“Tabba”: I overtook him about four
miles out from Collinsville (N.Q.) and
stopped to offer him a lift. He didn't
want to be sociable, ignored me and
went purposefully on his w ; ay. While I
was inspecting the bridge at Belmore
Gully he hurried past. He hadn’t gone
far when I passed him again on my way
to the Suttor River bridge about 40 miles
further on. On the return trip, near
Havilah station, I saw him padding
doggedly towards me. With 18 miles
behind him he showed signs of wear,
but was still moving at a cracking pace.
Passing the Havilah turn-in meant he
had at least another 40 miles ahead of
him. As I watched he hurried to a pool
of water and stretched out flat in it ; but
he was soon out and briskly shook him-
self as blue cattle-dogs will, and trotted-
off along the lonely bush-road. Obviously
he knew where he was going, as though
this was a Sunday ritual following Satur-
day night in town. And no doubt the
dog-house when he got home.
* * * *
“G’roper”: That note on the black-
boy (Xant ho r rhea) (B. 24 /12 / ’5B) re-
calls that the abo. of the early days of
white settlement brewed a toddy from
the multitude of its tiny flowers. In those
days sugar came to Australia in mats
of woven palm-fronds. When empty,
these were acquired by Binghi, chopped
into small pieces and soaked with an
infusion of the blackboy-flowers. It
developed a fair punch, and to add to
the effects Binghi, being a born actor,
would stagger around, imitating the
whites who got drunk on the more-
potent rum.
THE STRATEGIST
Out of the crust of long months, a frog
Stiffly rejoices —
Rain-dark under a dark sky, hear
The evening’s little voices:
Clay sucks back from the boot-heel,
whimpers along
The shovel’s blade,
Rain is a prickling on hat-felt, a last
dead rustle
The old leaves made.
The man with land-levels and waterways
etched on his brain
Digs in the shallows.
And the red racing water swishes its silks
Through last year’s mallows.
Rip of that tan silk bundled over grey
spillway
Sings to his ears —
Earth-stain and life-surge tumbling to
quiet storage —
And as he hears,
Still, with his shovel, under the great
quiet sky,
On his wet clay shelf.
The man who turns rivers with tractor
and bank and ride
Must laugh at himself :
“Forty years, to measure and plot in the
ways
Of God’s weather —
And one flying hour of this shows more
than all
My years together . . .”

T.P.N.G. Whither Away?
By LEN KING
An emmissary last year
(before the present
T.P.N.G. income - tax
proposals were mooted)
of the Australian Auto-
mobile Association, I visited the
Territory of Papua and New
Guinea to spark the formation
of an autonomous auto-
mobile association. I found
that the practical interest of
Australia’s 1,000,000 organised
motorists was the stimulus that
the Territory motorists were
longing for. The formation,
control and management of a
motorists’ body of their very
own was a challenge they took
up with relish and zest.
I found, too, that the develop-
ment and progress of T.P.N.G.
was way out ahead of any-
thing I had imagined. The
whole place is on the up-and-
up. With almost everybody
doing well for Australia, their
business interests and them-
selves. But with, of course, the
customary exceptions.
1 confess I thought those
thinking negatively and flirting
with defeatism were rather too
many, though I was stoutly
assured by locals that the per-
centage today would not be
nearly what it was four or five
years back. My experiences on
this side best and very simply
might be expressed in the terms
of a discussion with one who
indeed was dogged.
“A motorists’ club won’t achieve
anything up here. You can’t get
anything out of the Administra-
tion.”
“Well,” I countered, “in every
other motorised spot on earth a
cohesive and responsible voice of
motorists, raised constructively and
objectively, always has achieved
something—a great deal in fact—
for motoring as such, and, inciden-
tally, for the general wellbeing of
a community. In Australia, as a
case in point, the Government hier-
archy welcomes and rests consider-
able value upon the viewpoint of
organised motorists, not only in
matters which vitally affect them
but in the national interest.”
“It’s different here,” he con-
tended. “You won’t get anywhere
with the Administration. It won’t
even listen to you. Here everything
is for the natives. There is nothing
f®r the whites. You Australian tax-
payers just don’t know what is
happening to the £12,000,000 they
send up here each year. You really
ought to make it your business to
find out.”
“To be frank, I don’t: not many
of us Australians would know in
any detail what happens to that
£12,000,000. In a final analysis,
though, the great majority of us
would be satisfied that a job is
being done up here. In any case,
we think you all are good coves
and we like you. So we are happy
to shoot-up a parcel of cash each
year. Also, we are of that ilk who
would wish to honor the obligations
of a certain mandate we have in
trust from the United Nations.”
“Let's get this straight,” he said.
“What the white man gets up here
is peanuts. A few crumbs and
scraps. For hospitalisation, educa-
tion of his kids, dromes, ports and
roads. Any Australian State would
bi ashamed of the roads up here.
1 tell you, everything is for the
natives—except what goes down the
drain. A large hunk of money goes
down the drain, because the place
is run from Canberra. By ‘bods’
who don’t know the place or its
needs. Probably have never seen
the place and barely know w'here
it is on the map.”
“I agree that no Australian State
would be exactly proud of T.P.N.G.
roads,” I said. “But circumstances
are hardly comparable. If it is true
that a lot of money goes down the
drain here, I doubt it is novel. For
there is a pretty healthy school of
thought in Australia (where we have
Government of the people, for the
people, by the people) that a lot of it
goes just there. As a case in point,
take the Defence Department. But,
speaking of self-government, why is
it that you people up here are so
reluctant to accept local-government
as offered you by the pow'ers-that-
be? You are, you know, just a
little short on civic pride.”
“I am telling you it’s the Adminis-
tration. Who would be silly enough
to accept the responsibility of local-
government when you know in
advance you cannot get anything
from the Administration? It would
be the thin edge of the wedge for
paying rates and taxes. This so-
called Legislative Council we've got
now is stacked. Try as they might,
our elected Members can't get a
break for us free-enterprisers. If
we Territorians had the running of
the place, free-enterprise would go
ahead in leaps and bounds and the
native population along with it.”
“Perhaps it is only a minor
matter,” 1 interjected, “but were it
a practical proposition that
T.P.N.G. could become the seventh
Australian State, that fact wouldn’t
mean release from the obligations
of the mandate. Whence then would
that £12,000,000 be raised?”
“Why should the United Nations
tell us what to do? Australia should
send us money because of what we
are putting-Up with here. Develop-
ing these ‘bois’ and ‘meris’ to self-
determination in a few years: why,
they won’t be able to look after
themselves for generations—if ever.
Anyhow, if money is going to be
poured down the drain, as in Aus-
tralia and its States, then we should
be allowed to do our pouring our-
selves.”
“It seems to me there are one or
two other points that you possibly
may be overlooking. The Com-
monwealth taxes all income-earners
in Australian States and makes
hand-outs to the States to help them
govern, but those hand-outs are not
nearly enough to go round. I
wonder have you thought of this?
Have you pondered the possibility,
too, that under the mandate, U.N.
might look for a vote for the natives
if T.P.N.G. became a seventh Aus-
tralian State?”
As I have recorded, the
defeatists I encountered were
only relatively few. But as all
minorities, they own the loudest
voices and have the most to
say.
I came away impressed with
what I saw. I am sure that
in the next war to end all wars,
T.P.N.G. will still be our front
line, as it was in ’39-’45. That
with the continuance of pro-
ductive development T.P.N.G.’s
output could make Australia
virtually self-sufficient. I am
convinced, however, that there
will be no response to current
offers of local-government until
the conditions there are made
really attractive and somewhere
in line with 1.-g. as known in
Australia.
1 am even more convinced
that a much greater measure of,
and more realistic, authority
should be vested in the
T.P.N.G. Legislative Council,
and as a matter of urgency.
A pointer to future policy
might emerge from the con-
cerns and conflicting doubts of
the moment by a plebiscite.
Yes! Let them all have a vote.
To decide whether the future
should lie within the bounds of
fi) self-determination, (ii) con-
tinuance of the mandate, or,
(iii) “union” with Australia.
"Goodness! Throttle-back, Howard! Oh, level-out! Heavens, Watch that tree!”

ALLIED MILLS, LTD.
A fter nine years of incor-
poration as a public com-
pany, during seven of which
the dividend did not exceed
5 p.c. and the shares were
mainly below par on the
market, Allied Mills last year
hit the Stock Exchange head-
lines for the first time and
looks like remaining there.
Extraordinarily, profit-earn-
ing has burgeoned forth at a
time of great difficulty in the
flourmilling industry .as a
whole, but particularly in
N.S.W., where most of the
assets and investments of
Allied Mills are situated. A
severe drought in 1957 and a
wheat-crop failure was fol-
lowed by a loss of export
markets in 1958, and those un-
aware of the unpublicised
activities of the Allied Mills
board, aimed at stabilising and
broadening the base of its
interests, may be pardoned for
having taken a dim view of the
co.’s prospects right up to
1958. In the early part of
1958 the co.’s £1 ords. sold as
low as 18s. 3d.
Allied Mills, Ltd., was in-
corporated on October 18,
1949, and it took-over the busi-
ness (at Summer Hill) of
Mungo Scott Pty., Ltd., an old-
established flourmiller, and
its associate, Thorpes, Ltd., the
pioneer in N.S.W. of stock-
feed manufacture, a necessary
adjunct of any flourmiller.
Allied Mills also owns all
the shares in Jacketts Pty.,
flourmillers, of Strathfield, and
Keys and Co. Pty., which owns
a very modern flourmill at
Narrabri. At the time of in-
corporation it also held con-
siderable interests in other
allied industries.
These interests have now
been greatly extended, and
that explains the sudden meta-
morphosis in the co.’s earning-
power since 1955. In that year
net profit (excluding the
interests of minority share-
holders) was £54,689. Results
since are shown in the accom-
panying profits-table.
Behind the dramatic change
have been the manufacture of
Daffodil margarine and the
taking-over of bakeries. These
developments have had a revo-
lutionary effect on earnings,
and they have been achieved
so far with only very small
additions to capital account,
but with considerable reliance
on outside finance and plough-
ed-back profits. This is the
picture presented by compara-
tive consolidated balance-sheet
figures:

Since the close of accounts the
first share-issue since incor-
poration has been announced
—one new ord. for every four
ords. at par, which will take
ord. capital up to £644,560,
and the share-register total,
including the cheap 5 p.c. prefs.
to £844,560.
In the latest accounts (to
October 31 for the parent co.)
the board mentions a “policy
of pursuing developments out-
side the milling industry... .by
a substantial investment in
bakeries.” During the year
freeholds of some subsidiaries
were revalued at slightly below
V.-G., and the surplus, together
with a surplus from revalu-
ation of portion of a sub-
sidiary’s plant, were used partly
to write-off goodwill-on-con-
solidation (£144,979 in the
previous accounts), and the
balance (£131,541) was carried
to reserves.
Revaluation and investment
in bakeries were jointly respon-
sible for most of the increase
of £593,857 in freeholds and
plant last year.
Commenting on things in
general, the board puts it this
way: “The adverse effect on
flourmilling activities of the
severe drought conditions in
N.S.W., with the resultant loss
of all export trade, was more
than offset by improved results
of subsidiaries operating in
other fields.”
Since 1956 the co. has been
in the habit of appropriating
part of the tax-paid profit as a
“plant-replacement reserve.”
In 1956 the amount was
£30,000, in 1957 £50,000, and
last year £BO,OOO. In the
following table these appro-
priations have been treated as
genuine profit:—

Depreciation of £160,363 (up
£35,998) was allowed, and a
net £214,699 (up £70,804) was
provided for taxation. Out-
side interests in subsidiaries
were allocated £94,517, and
£2OOO (down £18,000) was pro-
vided for contingencies. Plant-
replacement allocation
(£BO,OOO, up £30,000) and profit
claimed (£154,361, up £41,498)
together made-up the £234,361
shown in the foregoing table.
This represented 43 p.c. on
ordinary capital, allowing for
pref. requirements compared
with 30 p.c. and 20.4 p.c. in the
two preceding years. The div.
was lifted from 6 p.c. to 10 p.c.,
and an amount equal to nearly
three times all div. require-
ments was carried to reserves.
A 10 p.c. ord. div. on capital
as it will stand after the new
issue is fully paid will be
£64,456, and the pref. div.
stays at £lO,OOO p.a.
It is impossible from the
figures presented to gain a clue
as to how much any one of
the co.’s diverse activities con-
tributes to profits. Margarine
is not even mentioned in the
report.
Last balance-day the ords..
had a net tangible backing, on
conservative valuations, of
445. sd. a share. The £1 ords.,
now ex-rights, have jumped to
395. 6d., with the rights sell-
ing at 19s. 6d. In each case
the immediate yield offering is
a shade over 5 p.c. on a 10 p.c.
div. basis, with the prospect of
further issues and/or a div.-
increase not far away.
Capital Decision
[From London]
HThe Capital Issues Commit-
tee, formed as a war-time
measure to restrain new issues,
is now in cold-storage. It could
be disinterred, but the City,
joyously unmournful, hopes
not. In fact, there is disap-
pointment that its remaining
functions —the control over
borrowing from persons abroad
and over the issue of
redeemable shares to avoid tax
—have not been passed to the
Treasury and the central bank.
The C.I.C. operated secretiy,
mysteriously and illogically
with authoritative power. No
reasons were given. While its
usefulness was arguable, its
reputation was not. Its veto
has prejudiced the raising of
capital where justified and
encouraged it where not —as,
for instance, in the mushroom
formation of small hire-
purchase companies. Perhaps
the summary rejection, a few
weeks ago, of the Midland
Bank’s application to increase
its share-capital came to appear
so ridiculous that the Govern-
ment wisely took belated
action.
Another opinion is that the
Government is not satisfied
with the degree of economic
recovery and is anxious to give
it another fillip. This can
safely be done without alarm,
for there is no evidence of a
queue of borrowers impatiently
sighing for money. The busi-
ness outlook is too uncertain
for this, and many firms are
working under capacity.

MAORILAND FINANCE AND INDUSTRY
[From Wellington]
A N.Z. Government-spon-
sored trade mission, the
first of its kind, is to go
to Australia for two weeks
in April. The 30 industrial,
manufacturing, banking and
commerce experts who are
to make-up the mission will
be led by Mr. W. Fisher,
managing-director of Fisher
and Paykel, Ltd., of Auckland.
The mission will visit
Sydney, Brisbane and Mel-
bourne. Representatives in the
delegation include leaders in
the fields of timber, bloodstock,
dairying, fish and seeds and
grain.
A number of prominent
businessmen have agreed to
join the mission. They include
J. C. Fletcher, managing-
director of Fletcher Holdings,
Ltd ; C. U. Plimmer, managing-
director of Wright Stephenson
and Co., Ltd. ; and C. Rex
Moore, managing-director of
Berlei (N.Z.), Ltd., and presi-
dent of the N.Z. Manufac-
turers’ Federation.
Trade with Japan
N.Z. Prime Minister, Mr.
Nash, is flying to Japan this
month for top-level talks on
trade and international affairs.
He is hopeful that the visit will
lead to the expansion of traGe
between Japan and New
Zealand.
Mr. Nash said there would
be at least 10 major points for
d scussion with the Japanese.
They included future Japanese
trade in relation to China and
Ihe South-east Asia areas,
where New Zealand hopes to
expand exports in the future.
Mr. Nash hopes to visit
Japanese industries which are

industrial capacity.
The N.Z. Forest Service is
negotiating for the sale to
Japan of pinus radiata scrap.
Scrap is left on the forest
floors after the smaller trees
have been taken out and cut-
up for chipboard and firing. It
is considered a nuisance by
foresters ; it can harbor insects
and be a fire hazard. After
pulping in Japan its main use
would be for paper and card-
board. Extensive investigations
into the economics of a soft-
v/ood scrap export trade have
been made by the Forest Ser-
vice and a firm quote for the
supply of the timber in bulk
quantities has been given to
Japan.
TY in N.Z. ...
Several companies, both in
N.Z. and overseas, are in-
terested in the establishment of
private television-stations in the
Dominion. The Government,
however, has yet to make deci-
sions on a number of major
factors.
Nine points have, been
officially listed for considera-
tion and decisions. They
are:
(1) Opportune time for the estab-
lishment of full television services.
(2) The administrative system under
which stations should be estab-
lished, operated and controlled,
including a decision on State-
ownership private ownership or a
combination of both. (y) The
financing of stations, including
taxation on television components.
(4) The areas in which Stations
could be established first. (5) Con-
ditions applying to the licensing of
stations. (6) Hours of operation.
(71 Standards which should be
followed in programmes. (8) Con-
ditions desirable in prog.ammes,
including the supervision or politi-
cal, religious and other controver-
sial matters and advertising. (9)
The effect on normal radio-services
and whether or not the two could
be co-ordinated.

Kraft in Melbourne
Tn Melbourne considerable
criticism is now being
voiced at the offer of one
National Dairy (U.S.) share for
five Kraft Holdings shares,
which was equivalent to
88s. 6d. a Kraft share but only
at the recent National Dairy
peak price on the New York
market. The irate Melbourne
shareholders’ comments are
belated ; apparently they have
just got back their breath.
The chief, and apparently
unanswerable —at any rate, un-
answered —complaint is that
the offer has been made on
the basis of low dividends (in
relation to lush earnings) that
have depressed Kraft market-
value, and that the profits
returned to the business must
now be about to make it an
even more profitable company,
Other unfavored aspects of
the offer are that there is no
cash-offer alternative ; that the
Australian shareholders would
not be represented on the

Special Bonds
[From Canberra]
'T’he Commonwealth Treasury
■*- has come up with a real
money-raiser for the Govern-
ment the issue of special
Commonwealth Bonds to small
investors in Commonwealth
securities, the special merits of
which were explained in B.
22/10/’5B.
For some time past the
Government had been con-
cerned about the lukewarm
response to Commonwealth
loans, which are essential to
the financing of States’ works
programmes.
Last October the Treasury
“brains trust” came forward
with the suggestion of special
bonds, which can be redeemed
at full face-value at any time
during their currency.
The response has been over-
whelming.
Since last October, when
they first hit the market,
61,000 Australians have taken
out £25,700,000-worth of these
bonds—£l4,4oo,ooo in cash
and the remainder in conver-
sion issues.
The special bonds are par-
ticularly suitable for persons
who have limited amounts of
capital to invest (the maximum
they may take is £5OOO-worth)
and who may want their money
back at short notice. But the
longer they hold them the
higher the interest (and the
greater the premium) they get.
Newly appointed Treasurer
Harold Holt, announcing the
flotation of a new Common-
wealth Loan for £25 million,
said the amount was
lower than previous loans for
two main reasons.
Firstly, it was a compara-
tively short time since the last
Commonwealth Loan was
floated, and, secondly and
more importantly, the special
bonds would remain on offer
during the period of the loan.
Interest on the present issue
is 4 p.c. p.a. to 31/12 / ’6O, 4|
p.c. from 1/1/’6l to 31/12/’62,
and 5 p.c. from l/l/’63 to
31/12/’65. Subject to one
month’s notice by the holder,
the bonds may be redeemed
at £lOO- from 1/ 7 / ’59 to
31/12/’6l, at £lOl from
1/1 / ’62- to 31/12 / ’63, at £lO2
from 1/1 /’64 to 31/12/ ’65,
and at £lO3 on maturity (Jan.
1, 1966).
The new bonds have clearly
encouraged subscriptions from
people who had not previously
invested in Commonwealth
securities, while a number of
small investors who regularly
took out issues of Common-
wealth stock now prefer to
take out the special bonds.
Two Questions
[From L. Owen]
"Two queries from Queens-
land, and the first deals
with Report 41:
Your review of Report 41,
"Summary of Oil-search Activities
in Australia and New Guinea to
the end of 1957”.(8. 31 /12/’5B), is
a generous one, and I assume that
you accept the data printed in the
pamphlet as authoritative.
In your article “Oil Retrospect
for 1958” (B. 14/1 /’59), however,
you give the well-depths, at the end
of 1957, of Learmonth, Dural 2,
Komewu 2 and Barikewa as 6155//.,
2740//., 8025 ft. and 5590//. respec-
tively, while Report 41, for the same
wells, shows 7636//., 3795//., 8028//.,
and 6940//.
Which of these figures are
correct ?
Those given in the Bulletin
are the right ones for the end
of 1957. Apparently Report
41 published the latest depths
available at the time of going
to press. Thus 7636 ft. is the
depth at which the Learmonth
well was abandoned at the end
of January, 1958; 3795 ft. is
the depth of Dural 2, as
reported on 6/3/’5B ; and
6940 ft. is the depth reached by
Komewu 2 in early February,
1958.
It is a pity that these dates
were not given with the
depths as printed in Report
41. As it is, they are assumed
to refer to the end of 1957 in
conformity with the title of
Report 41.
This omission also affects
the total footage given for each
State, and the grand total, all
presumably to the end of 1957.
Second question:
Is the striking of rock-salt in the
Frome Rocks well a favorable omen
for ail ?
This query reached me
when “Rock Salt” (B. 28/1 1/59)
was in the press ; otherwise I
might deal with it in that
article.
Salt-water, almost invariably,
occurs where oil is found in
nature ; that is not surprising,
as most petroleum deposits are
supposed to have originated in
marine environments. On the
other hand, oil in measureable
amounts is found in conjunc-
tion with salt only where con-
ditions are favorable to the
segregation of petroleum.
It has been suggested that
mineral oil, in some cases,
owes its genesis to radioactivity
produced by the K4O isoptope
of the potassium contained
in many deposits of rock-salt;
field evidence, however, does
not lend much support to this
view.
My own opinion is that the
striking of rock-salt in any well
has little —if any—bearing on
the chances of striking oil in
that well. The regional oil-
significance of the finding of
masses of rock-salt is de-
pendent so largely on the
geological history of the
region that the answer will vary
from district to district.
[ln the article by Mr. L. Owen on
“Frome Rocks Salt,” B. 11/2/’59,
p. 22, in the ninth line “formation”
should have read “formations,” as
in the quotation in the second and
third lines.]
Whale Quotas
/"\N January 2 Holland with-
drew conditionally from
the international whaling con-
vention, its withdrawal to come
into force on June 30 unless
agreement is reached before
then on the allocation of quota
of whales allowed to be caught.
On December 31, Norway
announced its projected with-
drawal from the convention
unless a new quota-agreement
was reached within six months.
Any new quota-agreement
would need to include Russia,
which is increasing and
modernising its whaling-fleet.


A PUKKA SAHIB
By R.R.D.
WHEN the English
voluntarily gave -up
the Indian subconti-
nent, the popular
reaction was one of glee at
the discomfiture of the “pukka
sahibs.”
This shows exactly how far
public opinion has been
allowed during this half-
century to stray from reality.
The particular words pukka
sahib became a music-hall
joke because very few people
understood what they truly-
implied, and those who did
recognise their meaning were
not the sort to bother them-
selves explaining.
So the words were used to
describe spurious characters
who turned-up in English com-
munities and wished to gain
some shade of military recogni-
tion. Rather than claim com-
missions in the Territorial
Army or on the übiquitous
reserve of officers (which could
be traced in the Army List),
they chose the Indian Army
as the imagined focus for their
adventures, and behaved as
they thought officers of that
esteemed body of men might
have done.
/Comedians and wisecracking
journalists, quick to sense
the European implicabons of
such place-names as “Poonah,”
took-up the cry. A legend was
born which was entirely false.
All sorts of undercurrents
combined to bring about this
ridiculing of the British
administration and prowess
which had made India the
keystone of an Empire based
on peace and justice. The
main streams of opposition
sprang from Socialist pacifi-
cism (and consequent mis-
understanding of the true aims
of strategy) and American anti-
colonialism. Less significant
trends were the sentimental
sympathy for the “underdog”
taught by women of both
sexes in State schools and lack
of venture bred by a Welfare
State.
The result made little
difference on the surface.
Soldiers and administrators
mourned the loss of a
strategic reserve which might
have acted earlier and more
economically to save Asia
from the Communist claws.
But they admired the dignity
of the withdrawal, while de-
ploring the slaughter caused by
a hasty'partition.
Indian and Pakistani leaders
took-up the torch which the
British handed them. They
even reclothed their armies in
the red coats which Americans
profess to hate so much.
Superficially the change
bothered no one but the
strategic planners (whose
trade makes them always think
20 years ahead) and the eco-
nomists (who are disciples of
a “gloomy science”).
Under the surface it
bothered millions. *
It was the sepoys and the
small farmers who originally
thought-up the term pukka
sahib, which correctly means
“mature friend.” Pukka in
Hindustani derives from pak
(holy) and means “of full
weight, genuine” ; sahib derives
through Hindustani from the
Arabic gahib, “a friend.”
They had good reason to
bless the rule of the Englishmen
who came to bring a new con-
ception of fair play to an
ancient civilisation based on
different ideas. It was to the
soldier or I.C.S. man that they
used to take their requests
rather than to their own
lawyers or to the English or
Indian “boxwallahs,” whose
sole aim was money.
TThe sepoys and the peasant-
farmers never really
understood why the British
left. An officer, travelling
through Pakistan and India
seven years after inde-
pendence had been granted,
told 5 strange story of being
approached at an airport by a
former sepoy. This soldier
brought him a complaint and
told his tale. (True or false,
who could tell? In the
Oriental way, that tale must be
sifted by judgment.)
All the officer could reply
“Scram!”
was: “Take it to your own
leaders, my brother ; we white
men have gone.”
The sepoy burst out: “You
were beside us on the battle-
field, you rode with us at polo
and shot with us in the hunt,
you punished us when we were
wrong and praised us when we
did well. Do you tell me you
have left us?”
The Englishman’s mind
went back to the fields of war
and of play.
But his only answer could be:
“My brother, we have gone.”
CJo to those who understand
these things and to those
who care to look below the sur-
face, it is not extraordinary that
Prince Philip has had such a
tumultuous welcome from the
people of India and Pakistan
on his recent visit.
Can you imagine the French
President being welcomed back
in that way in Vietnam, or the
Dutch rulers in Indonesia, or
even the Americans in the
Philippines? True, their
systems of colonisation were
completely different, but since
“colonies” are now a hate-
word, there's nothing to be
gained by discussing pros and
cons of these different
approaches.
Rather look deeper and
imagine what this demonstra-
tion really means. It is the one
hope of an answer to Com-
munism—that evil imperialism
spawned by the “democrats”
of Moscow.
Although it may seem far-
fetched, it is not, in fact, being
unrealistic to say that if
England and the British
Empire produced nothing else,
they at least brought the way of
the gentleman into the modern
world. This is an idea that
means the same thing to a
Muslim, a Hindu, a Buddhist
or a Confucian. It is in all
their creeds and it means more
than vague things like “free-
dom,” “democracy,” “self-
determination” or even “peace,”
as we use the word nowadays.
The British have given up
the pomp of empire and will
never seek to take it back again.
But they have not given up
their ideas of fair play, and
we, their descendants, have
inherited these. It is on the
races of British stock that the
world’s future depends. Their
task is to lead the nations out
of their present path of self-
destruction or starvation and to
show them the true way of
saving themselves by conquer-
ing nature instead of allowing
science to bring back the Dark
Ages.

At the Gallery
The N.S.W. Gallery has
really excelled itself with its
313 purchases and acquisitions
for 1958, and the exhibition is
a pleasure no one should miss.
Not that the ordinary buy-
ings from around the shows
are much different from what
you would expect: some good,
some bad, and on the whole
a pretty fair mirror of the
muddle art is in at the moment,
with so many artists going in
for abstract impressionism and
hoping that a picture which
really is nothing may somehow
be something ... as, some-
times, but not so often as is
hoped, it is.
There is force enough in
Thomas Gleghorn’s “Evening,
Nullarbor,” but not enougn
Nuilarbor for this commen-
tator’s taste ; Robert Juniper’s
“Glasshouse” is a smooth and
harmonious abstract in its sub-
dued colors; and James
Gle e s o n’s “Across the
Threshold” is visceral and
dramatic. But it is really a
relief among these large and
perilous adventures to come
across a few things with the
assurance of Ivor Hele’s self-
portrait and J. Carington
Sm i t h’s “Arrangement in
Blue.”
And it is still more of a
relief, if a national gallery is
a place for certitude, to meet
so many things as there are
here that have stood the test
of time: hung somewhat incon-
gruously amongst the most
recent paintings —for example,
Lawson Balfour’s beautifully
warm portrait of an Italian
girl, and the two little sea-
scapes by Nerli which look so
much like Julian Ashtons.
Though there are some
interesting contemporary paint-
ings from abroad, notably John
Bratby’s gigantic “Interior”
and Anne Redpath’s “Still Life
with Grapes,” it is chiefly in
the prints that the great
attraction of the exhibition
lies.
There are two very rich pen-
and-wash drawings by David
Cox. There are 22 etchings
and drawings by Norman
Lindsay (18 of them presented
by B. J. Waterhouse) and a
nice set of Spanish drypoints
by Lionel Lindsay. The gal-
lery has also acquired, but has
not yet exhibited them all, a
big set of prints by Syd Long.
Lambert and “Hop” are
represented, as, from earlier
days, are Gill (“Bush Funeral”)
and Skinner Prout. There is a
Hilder watercolor and there is
an excellent set of drawings
and sketches from Eric
Wilson’s notebooks.

things far too numerous to
mention, there is an “Oriental
Collection” in a room to itself,
with Chinese and Japanese
items and, instantly catching
the eye with their clear colors
and firm, clear-cut figures, 15
little paintings of the Madrasi
school of 1770, commissioned
by Warren Hastings and, after
many adventures, presented to
the gallery by George Sand-
wich, of Bowral (N.S.W.).

Black Magic
Hanging at Melbourne
Athenaeum is an array of
pictures by relatives and pupils
of Albert Namatjira.
Namatjira has shared more
than his physical fortune with
his friends: he has taught his
sons, daughters, uncles and
aunts and fellow-tribesmen the
secret of the white man’s magic.
And here they all are —Enos,
Keith and Ewald Namatjira,
Edwin and Otto Pareroultja,
Henoch and Herbert Raberaba,
Adolf Inkamela, Richard and
Cordula Ebatarinja—the latter
the first female abo. painter.
Here are Enos Namatjira and
Henoch Raberaba hopefully
asking lOOgns. for a pic-
ture, and a newcomer, Landara,
asking 60—and pretty certain
to get it. Most of them paint
exactly like their master.
Here is the Namatjira story
in a nutshell. If to be great is
to be completely focused on
something bigger than oneself,
it has to be conceded that the
ex-camel-boy is a great man,
if not a great painter. His
present troubles aren’t his
fault —they are the fault of the
well-intentioned noodles who
dragged him out of his isola-
tion and brought him to the
cities. These well-wishers
heaped dinners and speeches
on him and likened him to
Rembrandt, Velasquez and
other exalted creatures. He
didn’t understand a word that
was spoken, but every time his
name was mentioned he
nodded his head gravely. His
eyes were seeing the ghost-
gums, the fish-ponds, the emus
and the blood-red ranges of
the Never-Never.
Being granted white man’s
status involved him in a
conflict with his tradition. This
destroyed his focus, and he
relapsed back to his tribal
pattern. There is evidence of
this in a photograph hanging
in the present exhibition. His
face used to be serene, with
that lovely soft look of the
abo.—in the photo it looks
tortured.
The story is a sad one, and
it .would be sadder still if it
were a fact that Namatjira was
a potential Rembrandt. He
was hardly that, though his
early watercolors did show
considerable sensitivity. There
has been a gigantic hullabaloo
about him, just as there has
been a gigantic hullabaloo
about Picasso ; but it is quite
on the cards that a hundred
years hence both the unfortu-
nate black man and the
triumphant Spaniard will be
regarded as mcfSeum curiosities
rather than artistic giants.

Hamlet in Ballet
Now in Brisbane with the
Royal Ballet, Robert Help-
mann’s version of “Hamlet”
seemed to present viewer
a most concentrated and vital
account of Shakspeare’s
lengthy plot given in the space
of 20 minutes. His story is
told in flashback after an in-
tense performance of “To be
or not to be...fading away
into the funeral march of the
last act.
What follows is a dream-
fantasy that swirls all over the
stage in a fury of tormented
figures and the groans and
protests of Tschaikowsky’s
music from the pit. One can
supposedly review a lifetime in
the few moments of a dream,
and the tempo of hell in this
ballet seemed quite fitting to
sum-up Hamlet’s troubles. In
fact, the rushing scales of the
music and the nightmarish
scenery brought the whole sea
of them startlingly to life.
Apart from Helpmann’s own
excellent performance, Anne
Heaton danced the madness
of Ophelia without making the
audience wriggle in their seats
With embarrassment, as so
often happens in the theatre ;
and the company’s fine
orchestra most capably sent up
clouds of orchestral gloom.

wiched the sombre “Hamlet.”

The first papermakers
Using hemp rope, old rags and fishing nets, a Chinese
scholar, Ts’ai Lun, produced the first sheet of paper in
the year 105 AD. The ingredients were beaten into a
pulp, mixed with water, and poured over a strainer
made of grass.
The first recorded use of paper in the Western world
was in Spain in the 12th Century, and by the early
16th century paper was being made in England.
From these historic beginnings, the paper industry has
developed and prospered. In Australia, A.P.M.
Australian Paper Manufacturers Ltd. a company
owned by some 27,000 Australians, produces 250,000
tons of quality paper and paperboard annually.
This production is vital to Australia’s economy. It
saves millions of pounds annually of overseas funds
and provides many thousands of Australians with secure
employment; thus making a major contribution to
Australia’s rising living standards.

lively as Donizetti’s music, a
colorful succession of dances
somewhat like the third act
of “Swan Lake,” though with-
out its brilliance. The dancers
seemed to be enjoying them-
selves, but lacked the discipline
seen in earlier programmes.
“Pineapple Poll” came third
in every sense. Apparently
established as a good piece for
the end of a programme, it
nevertheless drew much less
incidental applause than might
have been expected. Sullivan’s
cheerful, bubbling music surely
calls for a light and agile set
of dances. Instead, John
Cranko has provided some-
thing that is more often clumsy
and graceless. His choreo-
graphy is rarely inventive
enough to catch the spirit of
the music, save where the Pot
Boy of the Portsmouth Inn
quite movingly demonstrates
his sad love for Pineapple
Poll. Johaar Mosaval ran
away with the show in this
part, and only the bright danc-
ing of Patricia Cox, as Poll,
came near to his winning per-
formance. Most of the time,
however, in spite of a well-
drilled effort by the company,
the brightness of “Pineapple
Poll” was provided by Sulli-
van’s music and Osbert Lan-
caster’s scenery.
D.J.M.
Wallenstein and Foldes
For the second of his Sydney
concerts American conductor
Alfred Wallenstein selected
much stronger fare than for his
first. The piece de resistance
was the Brahms Symphony
No. 2. In this work the com-
poser pursued the pattern, set
by Beethoven, of following a
symphony of grandeur and
profundity with one of sunny
spirits and vivacity. Its only
grave note is struck in the
adagio; and the contours of
this were beautifully formed ;
its tender introspections given
no little warmth. For the rest,
the Brahms cross-rhythms were
strongly knit; the orchestral
colors towards the end of ihe
third movement were not suffi-
ciently darkened after the
oboe's little song, played
enchantingly by lan Wilson,
had been heard against the
pizzicato ’cellos ; but the head-
long rush of the violins in the
final section conjured the spirit
of exaltation which is this
movement's essence, with the
massed brasses adding a
brill i a n t polish to the
orchestra’s full declamations.
Altogether, a solid and satis-
factory reading.
Hungarian pianist Andor
Foldes was soloist in the
Mozart Concerto in G Major,
K. 453. This work calls for no
spectacular feats of technique,
no dynamism ; it is elegant and
serene, and Foldes matched
its texture with ease and grace.
The orchestra achieved crisply
and with style not merely an
accompaniment but a highly-
effective collaboration.
The other orchestral piece
was Tschaikowsky’s overture-
fantasy “Romeo and Juliet” —
a highly-colored and intense
score, with many brilliant high- ,
lights, ranging from the turgid
conflicts between the Mon-
tagues and Capulets to the
tenderest of love-music. This
latter, one of Tschaikowsky’s
most gorgeous melodies, was
finely sung by the English-
horn and the muted violas.
Less effective was the “con-
flict” music, which at times
came too close to strident
bombast. But the general
structure of the work was
faithfully preserved, and the
episodes, if not exactly
drenched with passion, had at
least a liberal coloring of it.

“Battle of the V.I”
This film purports to tell
how the Polish Underground
first got wind of the making
of Hitler’s buzz-bomb, tipped
the R.A.F. off about the exact
location of it, and even cap-
tured one intact and got it into
England. But the story is
handled as sheer melodrama.
The dialogue is painfully stilted
and the suspense synthetic.
The acting all round is badly
overdrawn, and the German
officers emerge as mere carica-
tures. Michael Rennie and
David Knight, as the two
Underground leaders, are
wholly unconvincing.

PASTURE
IMPROVEMENT
AND LAND RECLAMATION
Pasture improvement and land reclamation have become of
major importance to the man on the land. With the steady
development of Australia and the increasing pressure of the
Technical Age, it is as vital for the primary producer as for the
industrialist to obtain greater and more economical production.
A great deal of research and develop-
ment work has been done, and
is being done, in the matter of
pasture improvement, and
obviously the entire subject cannot be
covered in detail in this review. How-
ever, we present some of the important
basic principles —quite simple measures,
within the reach of every man on the
land, large or small —which will improve
soil structure, check erosion, increase
stock-carrying capacity, build up property
values and vastly increase productivity
of pastures.
Published statements by Dr. J. Griffiths
Davies, associate chief of the Division
of Plant Industry, C.5.1.R.0., state that
18 million acres in Victoria and 76
million acres in New South Wales, in
the high rainfall grazing areas, could be
so improved as to double the total stock
carried. Figures for other States are
comparable.
• The Essentials for Pasture
Improvement
The essentials for pasture improvement
are: correct cultivation with the chisel
plough; treatment of the soil, where
required, with suitable fertilisers ; sow-
ing with suitable grasses, legumes and
fodder crops, using only top-quality
seed; and, in low-rainfall areas,
scientific irrigation.
O Chisel Ploughing —the Basis of
Pasture Improvement
The great advantage of chisel plough-
ing over conventional implements for
pasture improvement lies in the use of
relatively narrow tynes at spaced inter-
vals, which cultivate without producing
a fine surface soil and without bringing
large areas of sub-soil to the top. Mould-
board and disc ploughing tend to produce
a fine surface which is often blown away
as dust, or washed away as mud—the
first stages of deadly soil erosion—leaving
behind the compacted layer, the “hard
pan.” This hard pan is often the result
of natural causes, but is also brought
about by incorrect cultivation or by
stock tramping: it seals off the sub-soil,
which should be a reservoir of moisture
to be drawn to the upper layer through
the capillary channels of the soil.
The narrow furrows of chisel plough-
ing are cut without disturbing a great
deal of the surface soil or grass growth,
and they crack the hard pan and allow
water and air to enter the sub-soil which
is thus enabled to perform its intended
function as a reservoir of moisture.
Rootlets of pasture grasses are able then
to enter the sub-soil, giving sturdier
growth and eventually a greater depth
of fertile soil as a result of the decay and
formation of humus in the lower strata.
Ploughed with the contours of the land,
as they should be wherever possible, the
chisel plough furrows provide a series
of miniature terraces and relatively deep
channels to arrest run-off and to lead
the water through the broken hard pan
to the thirsty sub-soil. This checks one
of the main causes of soil erosion and
simultaneously increases the moisture-
retaining capacity of the soil.
• Operates in Wide Range of
Conditions
Different approaches, of course, must
be made according to soil conditions.
For instance, it is not recommended that
clay sub-soils be ploughed deeply at first.
A gradual process is advisable, as too
much clay may be brought to the surface
and have a sealing effect, thus defeating
the objective of chisel ploughing.
Chisel ploughing is effective on both
hard, compacted surfaces and on land
which has been waterlogged after floods
or heavy rains. In the first case, the
hard, dry compacted soil has reached a
state where the pore space is severely
restricted and moisture and air denied
adequate access: here the action of the
chisel plough breaks up the compacted
surface and allows water and air to enter
and penetrate, thus commencing the
natural restorative action of the soil.
Land which has been waterlogged
usually Carries a heavy rank growth,
which is unpalatable and sour. Chisel
ploughing will make possible the re-entry
of air and in many cases will restore the
land with a single working. In extreme
cases a run with a rotary hoe is advisable
first to chop up the heavy growth and
commence its assimilation as valuable
humus in the soil. As the chisel plough
is fitted with immensely strong tynes,
usually spring-mounted, rocky outcrops,
stumps, roots, etc., do not impede its
use on rougher types of pastures.
Another particularly valuable use of
the chisel plough is in the renovation of
old pastures. It has been found, for
example, that sod-bound phalaris and
paspalum pastures respond very markedly
to a single run with the plough.
It can be seen, then, that chisel plough-
ing in itself brings great benefits to
pastures even without additional
measures. Vital changes are made in
soil structure, moisture-retaining capacity
and soil fertility are increased, soil erosion
is checked, and stronger, richer grass
growth is encouraged. However, chisel
ploughing is often combined with other
methods, the most usual being the drop-
ping of fertiliser and the sowing of suit-
able pasture grasses.


SCIENTIFIC SOWING
OF SELECTED GRASSES
' I «4S7E have seen how very great
’ * improvements may be
made in pastures by a mechani-
cal method —chisel-ploughing.
The enlightened man on the
land, however, realises that to
obtain maximum value from
his pastures something more is
needed than scientific cultiva-
tion alone. It is becoming
increasingly common practice
now to combine chisel-plough-
ing with seeding and fertilising.
By the use of the seed- and
fertiliser-box, usually mounted
on a chisel-plough, these opera-
tions can be most effectively
combined into a “once over,
all done,” system. This
obviously offers great advan-
tages in time and labor saving
and in reduction of costs.
Methods of Sowing
The three principal methods
of sowing used in pasture work
are overseeding, drilling and
sod-seeding.
Overseeding is the dropping
of seed on top of the ground,
as distinct from placing it into
or under the ground. Pasture
seeds, which require only a
small amount of covering, can
be effectively sown in this
manner, though there is natur-
ally a certain degree of wast-
age. The seed- and fertiliser-
box is used for overseeding in
a variety of mountings—direct
on the tractor three-point link-
age, on a trailer or utility, or
or a tyned implement. One
of the most successful methods,
however, is to mount the seed-
box on a chisel-plough, so that
in one operation the soil is
broken, a degree of pasture
renovation is effected, and the
new seed is effectively sown.
Drilling ensures that the seed
is laid in rows and to a pre-
determined depth, and is more
commonly used for larger seeds
such as cereals, sorghum, millet,
etc. The seed-box and chisel-
plough, fitted with special
sowing-boots, is the usual
implement employed. With
the immensely strong chisel-
plough tynes, it is also being
used successfully to drill in a
catch-crop into previously un-
cultivated ground.
Sod-seeding has proved to be
one of the most popular and
economical methods of intro-
ducing desirable grasses and
clovers into existing pastures,
the operation from start to
finish requiring only one pass.
A special cast point on the
chisel-plough is used to open
the ground to a shallow depth
and seed and fertiliser is then
deposited in the narrow
furrows,- usually spaced about
nine inches apart. Existing
pasture growth is compara-
tively undisturbed, and this
method is particularly effective
for the sowing of clovers.

9 Sowing of Legumes
Achieves Astonishing
Improvements in Pastures
Qheep and cattle need protein-
rich fodder grown on well-
nitrogenated soil. This can be
achieved by heavy dressings
with artificial nitrogenous fer-
tilisers, which are expensive and
susceptible to considerable loss
through wind, rumoff, etc. It
can also be achieved by the
sowing of legumes, in particu-
lar the clovers. These amazing
plants take their nitrogen
supply from the air instead of
the soil, changing it into
readily assimilable chemical
form with the help of bacteria
which develop root nodules.
The bacteria feed on sugar
supplied by the plant which in
turn they supply with protein.
Clovers contain over 20% pro-
tein (dry weight) and their
establishment even in soils
almost completely lacking
nitrogen speedily produces
protein-rich pastures.
The decay of clovers in due
course serves the purpose of
enriching the soil with nitro-
genated humus ; this increases
the protein content of neigh-
boring grasses and renders the
soil more crumbly and water-
absorbent. It must be empha-
sised that without bacteria the
functions of clover are largely
neutralised, and in many areas
bacteria must be sown with the
seed to ensure the formation
of nodules. Specially inocu-
lated seed is available for this
purpose.
® Experiments Prove
Effectiveness
In a C.5.1.R.0. controlled
experiment near Armidale,
N.S.W., two groups of identical
weaners were studied, one on
native pasture, one on
improved pasture. After 12
months the wool yield on
native pasture was 5.41 b. „per
head per acre. In improved-
pasture the yield was 9.91 b. per
head and 29.7ib. per acre, since
improved - pasture supported
three times the number of
sheep. Live weight increased
from 431 b. to 571 b. in one year
on native pasture, and to 1021 b.
on improved-pasture.
A Ministry of Agriculture
test at Rutherglen, Victoria,
showed that subterranean
clover increased nitrogen con-
tent of the top 6in. of soil in
one year by 50lb. an acre.
Artificially this result could
only be achieved by heavy top-
dressing with an expensive
fertiliser. Sowing legumes is
the cheapest and most efficient
method of increasing soil
productivity of pastures.
O Good Pastures Also Help
Check Erosion
'T'he effect of systematic
A chisel ploughing in check-
ing soil erosion can be greatly
strengthened by the sowing of
pastures.
Where a good pasture exists
the ground is porous due to the
soil-mass being broken up by
vigorous root systems. The
foliage of the plants help to
absorb the impact of rain, with
the result that mud is not
formed as it is on bare or
sparsely covered ground, and
run-off does not carry away
surface soil.
Hilly grazing country is
most suspectible to erosion,
particularly when over-cleared
and over-stocked. The sow-
ing of suitable grasses in
such areas is of vital im-
portance. A method which is
being increasingly used is the
sowing of bands of pasture on
the contours. Here each band
is protected above and below
by strips of undisturbed ground.
The use of a chisel-plough and
seed-box combination to sow-
suitable pasture grasses by the
sod-seeding method is recom-
mended in such conditions. On
particularly rough timbered
country and on very steep
slopes sod-seeding is possible
only with a mounted imple-
ment.
The control of soil erosion
is of vital importance to the
man on the land. Detailed
technical advice on this and
other aspects of pasture im-
provement, is, of course, avail-
able from the various Depart-
ments of Agriculture, and
farmers and graziers are well
advised to seek such advice on
their particular problems.

THE VERSATILE CHISEL PLOUGH—
Its Value in Land Reclamation
""Though it is used most fre-
A quently in pasture improve-
ment, the chisel plough has
many other applications, and
it has been utilised very effec-
tively in land clearing work
and in renovation of old over-
run farm land.
In Queensland particularly
the chisel plough' has become
a standard implement in some
areas for this type of work. In
the Gympie district an 8 foot
unit, hydraulically operated
and fitted to a Bristol Crawler
Tractor, is clearing approxi-
mately four acres a day for
bean growing on steep hillsides.
The slopes, up to 2 inches in
1 foot, are so steep that the
tractors are obliged to ascend
them in reverse; with the
Chisel Plough almost on the
beam they remove old stumps
and bracken. These are pulled
to the bottom of the slope,
and by going twice over the
area farmers can prepare for
bean planting. Cost of clear-
ing is approximately £l5 an
acre as against £6O by hand
labour.
The Chisel Plough, fitted
with ripper tynes, is used in
cane-growing areas for open-
ing up and clearing new
ground, and is also used in
cane areas in combination with
the seed and fertiliser box for
cover cropping.
As an interesting footnote,
the Chisel Pl,ugh has been
effectively adapted even for
such applications as digging
potatoes and, with a special
box fitted, for planting
potatoes.
© Application of
—Chisel Plough and
Seed Bos
Any commonly used ferti-
liser may be successfully
applied with the seed and ferti-
liser box, by top-dressing, by
mingling with the top soil, or
by drilling. The box is most
successful when used with the
chisel plough ; selected stands
of lucerne or old phalaris
stands, for example, will show
a most astonishing rejuvena-
tion when run over with the
chisel plough and with a simul-
taneous dropping of fertiliser.


Land Reclamation
BRINGING DEAD LAND
TO LIFE
A ustralia presents a harsh
challenge to the man on
the land. Except in the com-
paratively limited temperate
high-rainfall areas he has to
battle hard to overcome
natural conditions, rigours of
climate, uncertain rainfall and
other difficulties.
Even today millions of
acres of good soil lie sterile
and useless under pest growths,
such as lignum, lantana, black-
berry, serrated tussock and
bracken. Many farmers and
graziers appear to think that
heavy and expensive equip-
ment is needed to defeat these
and that the actual clearing
costs are prohibitive. This is
not the case, and the imple-
ment to do the job was,
fittingly enough, developed by
an Australian. The rotary hoe
has proved to be a uniquely
effective implement for land
reclamation and heavy clearing
work, • and is economical
enough in original cost and
in operating costs to come
within the reach of any man
on the land.
The rotary hoe has, of
course, many applications in
general tillage, offering par-
ticular' advantages in its ability
to chop up vegetable matters,
crop residues, etc., and to mix
them in the most thorough
manner with the soil for the
formation of humus. It is the
only implement which can in
one operation transform virgin
land , heavily overgrown, into
cultivated soil ready for crops.
For these reasons the rotary
hoe has been used most effec-
tively in land clearing, replac-
ing old methods of burning
off, clearing and ploughing.
® Deadly Lignum Defeated
by Rotary Tillage
HToday millions of acres of
rich, black loam, Aus-
tralia’s best growing land, still
lie useless under tough lignum
scrub. The answer to the
problem is so easy and so
obvious that it seems incred-
ible that this enemy has been
conceded such a victory. H. E.
Kater and Sons, near Warren,
N.S.W., have pointed the way.
On their property, “Yangan-
bil,” lignum grew 10 feet high,
so dense in patches that it
was literally impenetrable. Yet
it was cleared in one operation
by a Howard 6 foot Heavy
Duty Trailing Rotary Hoe,
powered by a D 4 Caterpillar
tractor. Operating at 2\ miles
per hour, this combination
cleared the land at the rate of
1.63 acres per hour —approxi-
mately \2\ acres to an eight-
hour day. Expert observers
present stated that it was the
most outstanding demonstra-
tion of lignum eradication
they had ever witnessed, and
estimated the kill at 90 per
cent, after one hoeing. Condi-
tions were very unfavourable,

as 6 inches of rain had fallen
two days previously and the
ground was extremely rough
and uneven.
It was estimated that costs,
inclusive of capital deprecia-
tion, fuel, maintenance and
wages, would be approximately
30/- per hour, showing a clear-
ing cost of 18/6d. per acre.
This type of clearing opera-
tion has also been performed,
even more rapidly, with those
other enemies of the primary
producer—blackberry, bracken
and lantana.
• Bushfire Protection
/~Vne of the grimmest adver-
saries of the man on the
land is the bushfire, and there
is little need to stress the
immense damage done each
year to valuable properties by
fires. Because of the manner
in which it completely demo-
lishes scrub and heavy growth,
the rotary hoe is being widely
and successfully used for bush-
fire protection.
It is most effective in clear-
ing the thick, dry (and com-
pletely useless) growth which
is such an invitation to bush-
fires, and it is unequalled for
the quick preparation of fire-
breaks. Rotary hoes are em-
ployed extensively by Railway
Departments in the various
States for this type of work
and have been most successful
in their many years of use.
% Pasture Reclamation.
Classic—the Foxlow
Story
One of the classic examples
of scientifically applied
rotary tillage is the reclama-
tion of “Foxlow,” a rich pas-
toral property eight miles north
of Captain’s Flat, N.S.W.,
which had been ruined by acid
deposits brought down in
flood-waters from Lake George
mines. This outstanding graz-
ing property was covered with
silt, heavily impregnated with
acid, which was swept down
from the mine overburden by
the flooded Molonglo River;
in a short time it was a desert
growing little but tussock grass,
completely useless for pastoral
purposes.
Dr. E. G. Hallsworth, Ph.D.,
B.Sc., A.R.I.C. of the Univer-
sity of Sydney was called in
as a consultant. He recom-
mended heavy liming and use
cf superphosphate, following
intensive rotary-hoeing to
chop-up the heavy tussocks
which had baffled previous
attempts at cultivation. A
Howard “A” series trailing
rotary-hoe, 7ft. width, was used
with a Hanomag tractor; the
ground was rotary-hoed three
times, making a shallow cut for
the first run, then deeper with
each subsequent working.
Hundreds of acres of this
lost property were reclaimed
and put back into production,
v/ith a heavy stand of perennial
rye, phalaris, cocksfoot, sub-
terranean clover and New
Zealand white clover a
superb example of the versa-
tility of the rotary-hoe and its
adaptation to scientific methods
of soil reclamation.
G “Hard-pan” Not Caused
by Rotary Tillage
Tt has been sometimes stated
A that rotary tillage causes
a hard-pan, i.e., a layer of
tightly-compacted hard soil
below the surface soil. This is
not the case. Other methods
of cultivation do sometimes
cause hard-pan, and probably
inferior rotary cultivators
could havethis effect, but the
rotor blades of Howard im-
plements are specially designed
to avoid any possibility of
hard-pan. A study of the
angle of travel at which these
blades enter the soil, and of
their slicing and lifting action,
will make it clear to the most
inexperienced observer that no
hard-pan can be caused.
Probaly this misconception
arises from the fact that hard-
pan exists in certain types of
country before rotary hoeing
begins ; it may be caused by
weather conditions, by stock
trampling or by previous in-
correct cultivation.

Modern Mobile Irrigation
Tn many areas of Australia
where rainfall is sparse and
uncertain, some form of irriga-
tion is a necessity to maintain
continuity of crops and pas-
tures. There are, of course,
many opinions about methods
of irrigation, and various fac-
tors of water availability, types
of pumps, etc., have to be con-
sidered ; it is not intended to
analyse these here. There is
general agreement, however, as
to the necessity of irrigation in
many areas, and irrigation in
such cases becomes an integral
part of the pasture-improve-
ment programme,
As an example, controlled
experiments for a period of
over ten years at the Gatton
Regional Experiment Station,
Queensland, have established
that top-quality pasture can be
grown all the year in temperate
areas where suitable land and
water for irrigation are avail-
able. Dairy cattle, beef cattle
and flocks of sheep and lambs
have had ample supplies of
highest quality irrigated pas-
ture available to them at all
seasons of the year. There has
been no failure —the pasture
has been there regardless of
climatic conditions^
One of the most successful
irrigation systems for pasture-
improvement in Australia has
been the Wade Rain Spray
irrigation system, notable for
its extreme lightness, mobility
and ease of operation. This
equipment has been established
for many years in the U.S.A.,
manufactured by Wade Manu-
facturing Company of Port-
land, Oregon, and is manufac-
tured in Australia on licence
by Howard Industries.

a B.E. at the University of
Queensland and was associated
with Howard development for
years, before pioneering Wade
Rain Irrigation in Australia.
He runs a property near Pen-
rith, N.S.W. in his spare time.
The Wade rain system fea-
tures light aluminium piping,
provided in lengths of 20ft.,
30ft. and 40ft., which can be
very easily handled. A very
effective coupler is used, which
completely obviates the need
for spanners, bolts, etc. A
unique feature is provided in
the “Power Shift” system,
which is widely used on large
pasture irrigation. Here the
spraylines are mounted on
wheeled “dollies” and the
entire system can be moved,
fully-coupled, by truck or
tractor; the saving in time,
labour and initial cost are
obvious.
Wade rain systems have also
been developed for the small

The Good Seed
9 Importance of Seed
Selection in Pasture
Improvement
Tn pasture-improvement or in
A crop farming it is most im-
portant to choose suitable
varieties of seed of the very
best quality.
Care must be exercised that
the right type or variety is
selected to suit the district and
the class of country on which
it is required to establish the
pasture or crop. Strain, too,
is very important—there are
many strains of all varieties of
seed, some good, some poor.
Often the good strains are
suited to different areas or are
for different purposes. One
may be excellent for grazing,
another for hay making, or
a third strain may be useful
for either purpose. One par-
ticular strain may thrive in
warm climates, another in
cooler districts, or perhaps one
does well on hilly country and
another on flat land.
• Selection of Reliable
Strains Important
The best value in seed
very often does not mean the
cheapest seed per lb. Purity,
germination and strain must be
considered jointly with the
price. To get good value for
money good strains must be
selected. Many varieties of
plants which were originally
very good strains perhaps have
run out over the years through
bad management. Strains of
seed are maintained by con-
stant production of mother
seed to be used for reproduc-
tion. For instance in the case
of rye-grass there is a founda-
tion stock of seed which once
established and harvested
would be classed as pedigreed
seed. From a sowing of this
pedigreed seed is harvested the
next line known as mother
seed or mother-strain. From
this mother-strain which is
particularly good comes the
Certified seed. The strain can
only be Certified for a limited
number of years and then be-
comes uncertified seed. There-
fore it is necessary to con-
stantly work on the line to
ensure that it remains true to
type. Broadly speaking this
process occurs with all types of
seed, and the wise farmer
ensures that all seed purchased
has been handled in this
manner.
Before choosing seed it is
advisable to call upon the
knowledge of experts. Experi-
enced officers of the Depart-
ments of Agriculture or of
leading seed companies are
available to help the man on
the land. When the choice of
type or variety is made it is
equally important to ensure
that the seed is purchased only
from a leading seed company
prepared to stand behind its
products; wherever possible
Certified seed, sealed and
labelled, should be sought.

• Seed Purity and High
Germination Rate
Seed must be machine
dressed to a high standard of
purity so that all weed seeds,
dust and inert matter are
removed, and a high germina-
tion is necessary. Andersons
Seeds Limited, for example,
who have been producing
seeds since 1863, maintain a
complete seed-cleaning depart-
ment and seed-testing labora-
tory in Sydney, where the
latest type of American seed
cleaning machinery has been
installed. Branch offices and
seed-cleaning plants are main-
tained also at Brisbane, Coffs
Harbour and Bega, so that
uniform quality seed is avail-
able throughout N.S.W.,
Queensland and Victoria. All
seed marketed is thoroughly
machine-dressed and must
show a minimum purity of
98% and germination of 90%.
• Certification of Seed
When choosing seed it is
advisable to insist on Certified
Seed where this is available.
Not all varieties of seed are
dealt with in this way for
example, there is no Certifica-
tion Scheme covering lucerne,
though lucerne seed from
reputable houses is Govern-
ment tested for purity and
germination. Seeds are certi-
fied for various reasons, but it
can be noted that all Certified
Seed bears an official Govern-
ment seal and label signed by
a responsible officer —without
this it is not genuine. Bags are
sealed and labelled in various
sizes for example, subter-
ranean clover is put up in bags
of 1401 b. When ordering
smaller quantities a seal or
label is not available, but with
seed from a reputable house
exactly the same quality is
observed. Certification ensures
purity of variety or strain and
freedom from disease.
• Choice of Pastures
There is a very wide range
of seed mixtures from which
to choose, and it is advisable
to seek expert advice on the
most suitable for particular
conditions.
Perennial rye-grass and sub-
terranean clover probably are
the most widely used, as a basis
for pastures, but the choice of
grasses must be determined by
conditions. On the slopes and
tablelands, pastures of sub-
terranean clover and phalaris
tuberosa have proved success-
ful, also lucerne and phalaris
tuberosa, or lucerne with Wim-
mera rye or perennial rye-grass.
In coastal areas pastures of
paspalum and white clover are
the most widespread, but many
areas of perennial rye, cocks-
foot, phalaris tuberosa, often
with white and red clover, are
proving highly successful.
Kikuyu-grass, once regarded
solely as a pest, has proved to
be a most useful pasture
grass, particularly in sandy and
bracken-infested areas, and its
resistance to drought is
superior to most grasses.
Buffel-grass is a very promising
introduction, mainly in
Queensland; it is a drought-
resistant grass which will do
well on dry, sandy, semi-desert
soils. A recently developed
strain of Buff el is Gayndah
Certified, the only certified line
of this seed in Australia.
# Importance of Legume
Sowing
The importance of legume
sowing in pastures cannot be
too highly stressed, and this
has been discussed in an earlier
part of this feature. Clovers
are almost indispensable in
pasture-improvement, and their
value as manufacturers of
nitrogen and for the protein
enrichment of pastures is
enormous.
To stimulate and strengthen
this unique action of the
legumes, seed inoculated with
the nitrogen-fixing bacteria has
been developed, and this is par-
ticularly valuable in establish-
ing pastures in new areas.
Where soils with a high acidity
content are involved, legumes
normally will not flourish, and
to meet this problem “Lime-
Cote,” lime-coated legume seed,
has been developed. Very acid
soils will probably require
additional liming, but the lime-
coating on the seed will keep
the bacteria alive and assist
them to multiply and thrive.
Varieties and applications of
pasture grasses have only been
touched upon briefly here, and
it is advisable to seek further
information from leading seed
companies and from Depart-
ment of Agriculture officers.
It can be stated again that the
introduction of suitable grasses
is essential for pasture-improve-
ment, and that only the very
best quality seed should be
used in this important and
rewarding project.

The WILD CAL
COLUMN
Ampol Petroleum, Ltd.
"poLLO wing-up a mighty (84 p.c.) leap
in net earnings in 1956-57, Ampol
Petroleum pushed sales to new heights
again last term, lifted net profit (exclud-
ing capital-profits) by almost 20 p.c., and
rounded-off the year by upping the div.-
rate from 12| p.c. to p.c.
The sharemarket reaction to the record
results and the impending one-for-six
par issue has been to raise bids for the
co.’s ss. ords. to 20s. On present-day
market-values the scrip isn’t overpriced
at this figure, but then sharemarket
quotes —especially today’s—aren’t neces-
sarily a sound basis on which to estimate
the real worth of an investment, and,
assuming an unchanged aiv.-rate on
capital increased by the new issue, the
div.-yield after paying in full for the
new scrip would be little more than
3.7 p.c. The disclosed earnings-yield on
last term’s average ord. capital (valued
at market-price) was 5.5 p.c. On figures
alone, this wouldn’t seem to leave a
great deal of scope for the investor
anxious to build - up dividend - income
quickly and looking to the co., rather
than the sharemarket, for his rewards.
At the same time, the basic ingredients
of Ampol’s past successes are still evi-
dent in imaginative and forceful manage-
ment, vigorous advertising campaigns
(enlivened by Ampol’s touch of show-
manship) and a steadily-expanding local
market for petroleum products. And,
judging by last term’s decision to join
with B. F. Goodrich Co. (U.S.A.) in a
£3.5-million tyre-project and the £4-
million order placed with B.H.P. for a
32,250-ton super-tanker the co. has no
inclination to rest on its laurels.
Ampol has kept a distinctly Australian
atmosphere about its well-run service-
stations, and has established a remark-
able goodwill and momentum.
There is a true speculative interest,
too, through Ampol’s 70 p.c. holding
in Ampol Exploration, Ltd., which, in
turn, holds a seventh of the share-
capital in West Australian Petroleum
Pty. (Wapet). The Royal Dutch Shell
group was invited to join Wapet in its
Westralian oil-search last year and will
earn a two-sevenths interest in the ven-
ture by providing funds to cover approxi-
mately 18 months’ expenditure. The re-
arrangement of Wapet shareholdings on
Shell’s entry into the co. reduced the
California Texas group’s interest from
four-fifths to four-sevenths and Ampol.
Exploration’s from one-fifth to one-
seventh.
Originally known as Australian
Motorists Petrol Co., Ltd., Ampol kicked-
off, in 1936, with a paid capital of
£200,000 and a determination to break
into the petrol-selling trade in N.S.W.
Alba Petroleum Co. of Australia Pty.
(Melbourne) was taken-over in 1945 and
the present name adopted in 1948.
Boron variety or not, Ampol motor-
spirit has certainly taken the co. along
at a phenomenal rate in the post-war
years, and some idea of its success can
be gained by the 452 p.c. increase in
sales-gallonage and the 940 p.c. increase
in net profit over the last decade ; a
decade in which paid capital rose from
£1,073,950 to £9,378,241, and the earning-
rate on average ord. capital only once
slipped below 16.5 p.c. The ord. div.-
rate reached 12| p.c. in 1954 and was
unaffected by bonus-issues in 1955 (one-
for-four) and 1956 (one-for-five), both
financed by share-premiums.
The sale of motor-spirit provides
Ampol with the major part of its earn-
ings, and the co., once again, increased
its share of the market last term, motor-
spirit sales rising by 12.9 p.c., as against
an increase of oniy 6.9 p.c. in Austra-
lian consumption. Total sales, expressed
in gallons, jumped by almost 15 p.c.
to 168.5 million gallons, and exceeded
co. estimates by 3.7 million gallons. The
fleet of co.-owned and -chartered tankers,
which won some juicy profits at the time
of the Suez crisis, also proved “very
profitable” and a new 25,000-ton tanker
will come into commission next July.
The super-tanker is scheduled for delivery
in 1962.
Augmented by the greater sales-volume,
revenue from all sources rose by 14 p.c.
to £29.4 million over the year to
September 30 last, a reduction in the pro-
portion of revenue claimed by raw-
material costs ensuring that earnings felt
the benefit of the higher sales-figure: —

£60,000 pref. div. and 22.1 p.c. on average
ord. capital, compared with 21.7, 17 and
19.1 p.c. in the three years back to
1956. The £139,656 of share-capital put
into Ampol Exploration during the year
was treated as an appropriation of profit,
and the book-value of scrip in the
exploration-co., was unchanged.
Since the close of .accounts a final
call on ords. issued (one-for-two, at par)
in 1957 has taken paid capital to
£9,961,645, and when fully-paid, at a
yet unannounced date, next April’s one-
for-six issue will lift the total on the
share-register to almost £11,500,000.
Unaltered pref. and ord. div.-rates
on that lot would call for around
£1,477,500, or £233,500 less than last
term’s profit.
In addition to share-capital, which
includes £1,000,000 in 6 p.c. prefs.,
Ampol, at September 30 last, had note-
and loan - liabilities of £5,700,858, of
which £1,493,608 was raised last year
on 6 p.c. notes convertible into ords.
at par in 1963.
A lot of the fresh capital raised in
recent years went into the construction
of an Australia-wide chain of service-
stations, but, with “adequate service-
station representation” reported about a
year ago, a large part of last term’s
£2,743,565 influx of loan- and share-
capital was used to add much - needed
strength to working-capital, a £1,216,154
excess of current liabilities, etc., over
current 1 assets giving way to a current-
asset surplus of £948,575. Expenditure
on capital items dropped from £3,100,173

Finances were still none-too-liquid at
balance-date, but, as the National Bank
will provide any funds needed for the
construction of the super-tanker, re-
tained earnings and provisions, the share-
capital already received in the current
term and the proceeds of the new share-
issue should satisfy the co.’s capital re-
quirements for the next couple of years.
Turnover for three months to Decem r
ber 31 last was 12 p.c. above that of the
same quarter last term, and, if nothing
else, the anticipated increase in Austra-
lian consumption of petroleum products
should ensure another highly successful
year. Construction of the Goodrich tyre-
and-rubber plant was begun earlier this
month and the new co. (in which Ampol
will hold about 40 p.c. of the shares)
expects to be in production by the end
of this year.
With the ords. at 20s., rights to the
new-issue scrip would have a theoretical
value of around 12s. 6d. (depending on
actual dividend-differences, etc.), leaving
the ords. at an ex-rights price of approxi-
mately 17s. lOd. Options to take-up scrip
at a premium of 10s. a share between
December, 1959, and December, 1961,
sold recently at 4s. 4d., while the 5s.
convertible notes, which participate in
any issues after the next, would yield
1.9 p.c. to conversion ( plus or minus any
market difference at conversion) at 15s.

Bruck Mills (Australia), Ltd.
And now a glance down Wangaratta
way, to see how things are faring
with Bruck, self-proclaimed squire of that
prosperous Victorian provincial centre,
half of whose families are directly sup-
ported by the mill.
Taxation and depreciation reliefs failed
to counter a drop in net profit, but the
year’s result was still about equal to the
very satisfactory average level of the past
five years.
Provision for taxation came back
£35,000 to a still-quite-adequate £150,000,
and the depreciation charge was down
slightly, to £74,963, while administrative
expenses increased from £51,712 to
£58,096. The amortisation charge fell
from £14,903 to £4770 as a result of the
purchase by Bruck of its mill property,
previously leased from the Common-
wealth Government. The £150,000 mort-
gage written into the June 30 balance-
sheet represents the outstanding liability
against this item.
After deducting all operating expenses,
including those listed above, net earnings
were £226,343, compared with £242,207

Profit for the ordinaries was £213,843,
giving an earning-rate of 17.9 p.c. on
equity-capital, compared with 17.8 p.c.
for the past five years. Fluctuations have
been moderate —the rates lrom 1956-57
back were 19.2 p.c., 15.8 p.c., 17.3 p.c.
and 18.8 p.c.
Bruck Mills is necessarily the focus of
much interest, being as it is one of the
biggest Australian weavers of synthetic
cloths and wool-synthetic mixtures
destined for the fashion-market. And,
in the midst of the present wool-versus-
synthetics controversy, it can only be
admitted that Bruck is doing very well —•
much better than the textile industry
taken as a whole. For a comparative
latecomer on the local textile scene, this
is an outstanding performance.
The Australian firm of Bruck owes its
existence to the enterprise of Bruck Silk
Mills, of Montreal, Canada, and was set-
up in 1946 as a public company in Mel-
bourne. Commercial production, how-
ever, didn’t get under way until 1948.
This is one overseas-sponsored float in
which the Australian public holds the
thick end of the voting-power—through
nearly £900,000 of the £1,195,000 of ord.
capital and the £250,000 of 5 p.c. cumu-
lative prefs. A minority shareholding
has been acquired by the sponsor as
consideration for trade-marks, technical
services and machinery deliveries, and
there are also a few employee shares.
The last issue of scrip to ordinary
shareholders went out in 1950-51, and
took the form of a one-for-two par issue.
There was an issue on the same terms
in 1947.
The end-of-term balance-sheet shows
some points of interest. The £345,508
increase in the book-value of freeholds
was, of course, for the reason stated
above:—

amortisation of leasehold im-
provements, no longer required.
The £75,000 of shares in
other cos. shown among assets
relates to a 50 p.c. holding in
Bulli Spinners Pty., a con-
dominium in which the co-
partner is John Vicars and Co.,
Ltd., the Sydney spinner and
weaver. This affiliate spins
natural and synthetic-fibre
mixtures, and is reported to be
operating satisfactorily.
Currently, there are signs
that Bruck is confronted by a
market which is slackening,
perhaps more so than the run-
down of stocks and book-debts
indicates. Bruck would un-
doubtedly welcome a rise in
wool-prices, which, although
showing signs of firming, are
probably still running below
the cost-of-production levels of
synthetic-competitors.
Next accounts could show a
further fall in earnings without
surprising, but it would take
a series of very hard knocks to
even dent Bruck’s financial
armor. There are long-term
attractions in the ord. scrip,
which has fluctuated irration-
ally in past years, and is now
selling at 30s. for a yield of
8.3 p.c. The net tangible asset
backing is 325. a 20s. share.
F. T. Wimble and Co., Ltd.
XVT IMB LE AND Co., the
* * printers’-ink people, bring
forth their year -by - year
accounts in bare statutory
format, and these are usually
accompanied by reports which
wouldn’t absorb much of
Wimble’s chief product.
Such economy, albeit meri-
torious, leaves assessment of
scrip-values almost entirely to
the intuition of the share-
market.
Significantly absent is any
figure for that most valuable
of earning-indicators, the
annual tax-provision and
disclosed earnings tend to shew
a marked, correlation with the
level of dividends required on a
slowly increasing capital.
Not that dividends aren’t
visibly well covered visible
profits for the ords. last term
represented 26.1 p.c. on average
ordinary capital, compared
with the 15 p.c. payout sanc-
tioned ; and previous earning-
rates back to 1954 against the
same dividend have been on
a similar scale 23.9 p.c.
(1957), 23.9, 24.2, 22.7.
Wimble’s headquarters are
now at Rydalmere (N.S.W.),
which it pioneered as a
factory area, but over the past
year a plant recently estab-
lished near Melbourne has
been operating successfully.
Distribution is carried out in
every State. There is also a
New Zealand manufacturing
offshoot whose accounts aren’t
consolidated with those of the
parent. This subsidiary earned
a “satisfactory” profit for the
term, but “as a new and
enlarged factory was erected
during the year it was decided
to retain the funds in that
company.”
The name Wimble has long
been associated with printers’
requisites ; since 1867, in fact
—and during most of the inter-
vening period, Wimble’s ink
has been feeding the rollers
of Bulletin presses,
Net profit, states the annual
report, was £70,268 for 1957-

In its present form, the
N.S.W. registered company
dates from 1920, and public
share-interest from 1936. Divi-
dends have been on a uni-
formly remunerative scale, the
ord. rate averaging around 16
p.c. since listing, while giving
the feeling that inner strength
has been built-up at the same
time. There has, meanwhile,
been only the one major share-
issue, a one-for-one par issue
of ordinary shares, which, in
1953, doubled ordinary capital.
Balance-sheets tend to be
repetitive, and little comment
is needed on the obviously
sound financial standing and
high earning-potential of
Wimble. One item of interest
is the £40,000 “suspense”
appearing among liabilites.
This relates to a payment by the
Commonwealth Government
on account of a compensation
claim for premises resumed
compulsorily at Mascot, Syd-
ney, several years ago, over
which negotiations are still con-
tinuing :

Taken together with Wimble’s
long and successful career,
and an earning poten-
tial which is probably even
more formidable than it looks,
the scrip’s current price of
665. seems well enough justi-
fied. Yield on a 15 p.c. div.-
basis is only 4.5 p.c., but net
tangibles are solid —a visible
50s. each for the equities. The
company, as yet, looks to be
very moderately capitalised.
Samuel Allen & Sons, Ltd.
r T'HE slump in base-metal
A prices was a major factor
in the sharp fall in profit
suffered by Samuel Allen and
Sons last term, the smaller
lead - bonus showing - up,
chiefly, in results obtained
from the co.’s substantial
interests in the Mt. Isa area.
A versatile, 86-year-old
North Queenslander, Samuel
Allen and Sons owns a string
of hotels, most of them in
the coastal strip stretching
from Proserpine to Cairns or
in the mining-centre of Mt.
Isa. The co. is also active as
a wine, spirit and general
merchant and as an agent for
a wide assortment of manu-
factured lines, including
engineering - supplies, farm
equipment, rubber products,
air-conditioning units, etc.,
while one of its several subsi-
diaries, Magnetic Motors Pty.,
holds the Ford franchise in
Townsville and Mt. Isa.
Other subsidiaries operate
in Townsville (Hollimans Pty.),
Cairns [Wypers (Cairns) Pty.]
and Ayr (A. E. Clayton and
Sons Pty.), and, between them,
retail hardware, electrical
appliances, farm - machinery,
irrigation equipment, sporting-
goods, etc. The parent co.’s
home-base is at Townsville,
and there are branches in
Bowen, Cairns, Innisfail, Ing-
ham and Mt. Isa.
A burst of rapid expansion in
1950-51, stimulated by the de-
velopment of many of the
areas served and involving the
purchase or establishment of
a number of new subsidiaries,
led to a big improvement in
earnings and a more-or-less
comparable jump in paid capi-
tal. Except for a slip in the
1953 term, steady, if unspec-
tacular, progress continued up
till last term.
The div.-rate inched forward
from 6 p.c. to 6y p.c. in 1947,
reaching the present 8 p.c. level
in 1950, £142,856 of first and
second prefs. collecting a
cumulative 6 p.c. and partici-
pating with the ords. above
that point and in any capital-
surplus. A one-for-four par
issue in 1954 took ord. capital
to £810,582 and total paid-up
to £953,438. There is an
uncalled liability of 10s. a
(205.) share on the new scrip,
but to date adequate—and
cheaper—funds have been
raised, when needed, by the
acceptance of term-deposits.
Branches in the sugar-
districts of Cairns and Innis-
fail showed improved results
over the year to June 30 last,
and despite the poorer show-
ing made by a number of off-
shoots (all of which managed
to operate at a profit), gross
earnings and investment in-
come combined rose by
£12,165 to £846,464. How-
ever, this improvement was
swamped by a big leap in
expenses, up £75,071 at
£718,403 after providing an
extra £3425 (£27,069) for de-
preciation, and pre-tax earn-
ings tumbled from £190,961 to
£128,061.
The liability for income-tax
on earnings of this size would
have been about £48,000 (leav-
ing a net profit of around
£80,000), but by making use
of previous overprovisions for
tax (amount unstated) the
annual provision was kept
down to £36,492 (a drop of
£38,176) and the fall in net
profit limited to £24,730. As
a balance-sheet account the
tax - provision appeared at
£46,022:

The £91,569 profit represented
9.6 p.c. on paid capital (pref.
and ord.), as against 12.1 p.c.
in 1957, 12.5 p.c. in 1956 and
11.9 p.c. in the 1955 and 1954
terms. Another £34,934 came
in as capital-profits on the sale
of certain hotel-properties, the
trade of which has been
retained to the co. under long-
term leasehold tenures.
Finances were tailored to
suit the less-buoyant trading
conditions, and, as forecast by
the board early in the term,
there was a sizeable cut in
both stocks (down £61,202)
and book - debts (down
£121,858). Although an addi-
tional £22,191 was placed on
deposit with the co., funds
released enabled a big reduc-
tion in outside liabilities, and,
while working-capital slipped
by £31,337 to £754,786, the
ratio of current assets to
current liabilities and provi-
sions rose from 1.83:1 to
1.95: 1:

Renovations and extensions
were carried out at various
hotel-properties during the
year, and plans announced for
a new hotel at Townsville. At
this stage it seems likely that
the board would seek outside
money rather than make a call
on the contribs. should funds
be required for the erection
of the new pub.
The prosperity of the group
and of the areas in which it
trades is largely dependent on
the state of the local sugar and
mining industries, and, while
conditions in the current
term have favo/ed the
North Queensland sugar-
grower, there seems small
chance of a marked improve-
ment in results from the Mt.
Isa branches and subsidiaries.
As the tax-overprovision which
helped last term's figures will
be missing, too, the overall
picture isn’t particularly
encouraging.
Nevertheless, the 8 p.c. div.-
rate doesn’t appear to be in
great danger, and on this scale
of distribution the f.-p. 20s.
ords. would yield £6 19s. Id.
p.c. at 235. and the contribs.
£7 Bs. lOd. p.c., subject to the
10s. call-liability, at 10s. 9d.
Including uncalled capital, the
net tangible cover at June 30
last was 335. 9d.

From Herbert Holman
HThe iron and steel industry
-*• has for long writhed un-
easily in a no-man’s-land
between Capitalism and
Socialism. Fears of renation-
alisation have severely inhibited
its development, and the un-
certainty which bedevils it has
depressed share prices.
For some time, company-
chairmen have spoken-out
against nationalisation, and
steel firms have jointly spon-
sored a publicity campaign.
Their latest tactic, a door-to-
door public-opinion survey, has
inevitably come to light and,
no less inevitably, has provoked
astonishment, indignation and
embarrassment.
The operation, as conceived,
was estimated to cost upwards
of £300,000 and was to be
carried out on behalf of 200
firms (vaguely described as
“industrial” but believed to be
mostly iron-and-steel) in 127
marginal constituencies. Now,
because of the publicity, it will
be modified. For the straight-
forward, if unscientific, door-
to-door referendum, modern
sampling methods are to be
substituted. It is hard to under-
stand why these were not
adopted in the first place.
At Labor headquarters, the
righteous indignation amounted
to fury. It is a fair assump-
tion that the Socialists’
anger is in direct proportion
to their fear of nationalisation
issues being brought out into
the open.
Surprisingly the disclosure
has embarrassed the Conserva-
tives. This is probably because
the Central Office is at pains
to avoid any incident or cir-
cumstance which suggests that
the Conservative party is in
secret league with Big Business.
Storming the Bastion
A new venture, the 59
Theatre Company, has rented
the Lyric, Hammersmith, with
the simple and entirely com-
mendable object of presenting
great plays. Three men are
behind the enterprise, and none
is directly connected with the
stage. James Lawrie, a former
banker who went into the film
industry, is responsible for the
backing. The other two are
young television - producers,
Casper Wrede, a 29-year-old
Finn, and Michael Elliott, a
27 - year - old Englishman.
Future productions will in-
elude Otway’s version of
Moliere’s comedy, “The Cheats
of Scapin,” Strindberg’s
“Creditors” and Ibsen’s
“Brand.”
The season has opened
energetically with an episodic
play that would tax the re-
sources of the Old Vic or the
Comedie Fran?aise. “Dantcn’s
Death,” by Georg Buechner
(author of “Wozzeck”), has 21
scenes and calls for a cast of 32.
His view of the French
Revolution at the time of
Danton's overthrow by Robes-
pierre was essentially one of
personalities and their con-
fl cts. The force of his con-
victions emerges strongly. Men
are weaker than their passions,
lesser than the events they
aspire to control and, because
of the rottenness of human
nature, doomed to inevitable
calamity. Danton is seen as a
disillusioned libertine, recoil-
ing from the Reign of Terror,
and Robespierre, tight-lipped
but vengeful, as the weaker
character.
The impetus and restless
vigor of the acting are tor-
rential, but the quality is mixed.
Wrede’s production, though
clever and elaborate, is beyond
the capacity of the players and
of the small stage. Even
realism can be overdone. The
blade of the guillotine drops
heavily, leaving no head un-
severed. But four times is
three too many, destroying one
illusion and creating another,
emphatically not of the tragedy.
Buechner evidently was
inspired by Hamlet, for there
is an Ophelia-like scene the
effect of which only confirms
the supremacy of Shakspeare.
Patrick Wymark (Danton) is
burly, robustious and un-
sparing but solidly Anglo-
Saxon, not Gallic. Harold
Lang's Robespierre is better-
defined ; mean, callous and
remorseless, it lacks only inner
power. (Was it tiredness, or
absence of dramatic values that
made the author dispense with
him halfway through?) The
one outstanding character-
study is Patrick McGoohan’s
sober, malignant and incarnate
St. Just.
Special Occasions
The Arts Theatre Club is
presenting two Anouilh plays
of which the first, “Madame
De....”, a whimsical but over-
long cautionary tale about a
lady’s jewels, was written
specially for the occasion.
“Traveller Without Luggage,”
the second play, is a 20-
year-old parable of a soldier
who has lost his memory
and who is claimed by
several families as their own.
When he meets his real kin, he
likes neither them nor the
picture they convey to him of
their long-lost son and gladly
“adopts” an English uncle of
fantastic disparity. The play is
not as good as the situation
promises but the acting in both
pieces is, under Peter Hall’s
direction, the ultimate in polish.
What might have been a
tremendous occasion is the
play which Clemence Dane
wrote to commemorate the
double golden jubilee, private
and professional, of the
Cassons. Unfortunately,
“Eighty in the Shade,” though
not intended to be anything
more substantial than a show-
piece, is shallow, undistinguish-
ed and outmoded. Dame Sybil
Thorndike has her moments as
a retired actress, champing
and curvetting against the
dominating possessiveness of a
neurotic daughter. The light-
ness of her comedy is fresh
and gay as a fairy’s chuckle,
but the emotional scenes have
neither substance nor depth.
One realises why growing old
can be sad. Old people may
be strong, healthy and mentally
alert. But the world is no
longer their world, and how-
ever young in heart they may
be, younger people look
askance at them. This syn-
thetic play, with its woman’s-
magazine flavor, might have
suited audiences 20 or 30

Storm
By MARY KENT HUGHES
Up north we’re always
interested in strangers,
so as 1 was alone in the
dining-room when the
little chap walked in, 1 asked
him to join me. He said his
name was Aubrey Challoner,
and I told him mine; Tom
Anderson.
“Come up on the cattle-boat
did you?” I asked, knowing
there had not been a plane in
that morning.
“Yes. Had quite a good trip
up from Fremantle ; we called
in at all the ports.”
“Staying long?”
“Only a fortnight.” He took
off his glasses and rubbed them
clean of perspiration. “Thought
I’d like to spend my annual
leave seeing a bit of the
North.”
Some sort of an office type,
apparently. 1 was piloting for
the Flying Doctor Service, so
wasn’t surprised when Joe the
publican came in and said I
was wanted on the phone. I
noted down the details of the
call and went back to finish my
dinner.
The stranger was preparing
to leave the table.
“Here, hold on a bit,” I said.
“I have to go and pick up a
patient from one of the stations
a couple of hundred miles in-
land. Care to come for a flip?
It’d be a good opportunity for
you to see the country and how
we work up here.”
“If I wouldn’t be in the
way,” he said.
“No fear of that,” I said ;
“you’d be most welcome. We
always like to have someone
along with the patient on these
trips. Doc. can’t come himself
and they can’t spare a nurse
from the hospital—there’s a
big operation on this after-
noon.”
I was sorry about that, be-
cause I was doing a spot of
wooing, and had hoped
Jennifer might be able to make
the trip with me. Better luck
next time! This Aubrey
seemed a nice quiet chap, not
the sort to blow down my ear
when I wanted to concentrate
on the job, which is all one
really asks of a passenger.
We drove out to the drome
where the Dove was always
kept ready for an immediate
take-off, the stretcher made-up
and in position. My passenger
seemed a bit out of his element.
It was only when I had to tell
him to fasten his safety-belt
that I realised he hadn’t been
up before. He looked a bit
pale about the gills and 1 was
thankful for his sake as well
as mine that he wasn’t sick.
I’d taken a fancy to him.
He soon settled down and
began to ask quite sensible
“I dunno—just sneaked up behind him, growled
playful-like and he fainted."
questions about the country.
We flew round the steep escarp-
ment that demarcates the
Leopold Ranges from the
plains. He couldn’t get over
how different Northern Aust-
ralia is from the south, with the
carrot-red earth beating
through the pale, straggly grass
and the man-sized ant-heaps
rearing up like weird monu-
ments.
“Desolation,” he said, more
to himself than to me.
1 was really enjoying his
company as we yarned about
this and that, so the time
passed pretty quickly, and soon
we saw cattle coming in to
drink at one of the outlying
bores on the station we were
heading for.
We passed over the home-
stead. A utility shot out, and
reached the airstrip just as we
came in to land. The station
blacks lifted the patient on his
mattress from the tray of the
ute and placed him on the
ground inside the brush-
covered shelter that threw the
only bit of shade in the area.
A big stockman, he was red
in the face and muttering to
himself.
“To tell you the truth, I am
glad to see the back of him,”
said the manager’s wife. She
had driven him down.
“Last night he seemed to
have just a mild fever, but his
temperature’s been rising ail
day and he’s mighty sick. I
gave him the injection the
doctor ordered”—here she
noticed the surprise on
Aubrey’s face and smiled at
him as she explained. “Doc.
told me over the radio the
number of the bottle and how
much to give . . . Bill’s quiet-
ened-down a lot now, I hope
he’ll sleep all the way.”
I hoped so too, because the
clouds were banking-up and I
didn’t want any trouble from a
restless patient. So 1 got busy
and refuelled the tank with
petrol and myself with some
tea Marge had brought down
in a thermos, and we took off.
1 hoped to make the coast
before dark.
All went well for the first
hour-and-a-half, and then we
ran into one of the worst elect-
rical storms the Kimberleys
could' turn on. I managed to
straighten out the Dove and
put a signal through.
The storm was roaring out-
side, and for a time 1 didn't
realise that there was a big
noise going on inside —yelling!
As soon as I could spare an eye
from the panel, I took a look,
and there stood the patient,
shouting and waving his arms,
and the little chap trying to get
him down again on the
stretcher.
Of course, there wasn’t a
thing I could do to help ; had
my hands full just trying to
keep aloft. 1 heard a scream
and a thud. The plane keeled
over. I was too busy, then, to
find out what had happened.
it was another half hour be-
fore we sighted the drome.
Everyone in the town had
turned out to meet us with
their headlights blazing.
I got her down all right, and
went aft to open the door.
Aubrey, looking like death, was
huddled on his seat, his broken
glasses on the floor.
He must have had a terrific
battle ; his shirt was ripped to
bits and there was blood on his
face. The patient, quiet
enough now, was lying face
downwards across the stretcher
with a big bump on his head.
1 kicked a spanner out of Doc.’s
way as he climbed into the
crate, and two or three of the
blokes helped Aubrey out and
got a brandy into him.
He was so stunned he
couldn't talk for a bit. Then he
looked up at me and said very
quietly “Tom, please take me to
the police-station. I’ve killed
that man!”
“No .fear you haven’t,” said
said the Doc. who had finished
his examination and pumped a
syringe into the patient's arm.
“He’s only stunned and
shocked. He’ll come good all
right. Hop in the car now,
boy, there’s a nice hard bed at
the hospital waiting for you!”
Doc. was right. It would
take more than a spot of fever
and a bit of a spanner to kill
a stockman like Bill. He was
the life of the party at the send-
off we gave Aub, the night
before he went south.
The whole town, kids and all,
came to that send-off, and
everyone reckoned it was an
awful pity to see a man like
Aub wasting his life in the
city. He certainly had what
it takes!


No Party Has Ever Won All States
STATE ELECTIO IS YEAR
Within the next few weeks elec-
tions will be held in three States,
with a fourth one to follow
later in the year. Premier Cahill
has been playing secrets over the date of
the N.S.W. poll; Playford has announced
March 7 as voting-day in South Aus-
tralia, and Hawke, having already taken
the preliminary steps, is expected to name
his day this week. In Tasmania, the
fourth State with an almost time-expired
Parliament, the customary life of the
House of Assembly is five years, but
there’s a provision that this is reduced
to three years when the two parties win
an equal number of seats. This happened
at the last election, in October, 1956,
so another poll is due before the end
of this year—though it could come much
earlier than that.
The imminence of these four elections
and the obvious fact that the Federal
Labor squabble is spilling-over into State
politics has led to discussion on the
possibility of there being a non-Labor
Government in every State as well as
in Canberra before the end of the year.
The prospect is apparently causing the
Communist party some concern ; some
of the Comrades envisage the possibility
of the seven Governments getting to-
gether to ban the Communist party by
means of identical State Acts, thus
achieving what the 1951 referendum
failed to do.
It Hasn’t Happened
Tn the 58 years since Federation there
A have been several times when it has
seemed likely that the whole seven
Parliaments would come under the con-
trol of the same political party —but it
has never happened. In 1915, when
T. J. Ryan brought the first Labor
Government to power in Queensland,
beginning for the party a long run which
lasted, with one three-year break, until
1957, there was a Federal Labor Govern-
ment and Labor was in office in New
South Wales, South Australia, Westralia
and Tasmania. Victoria was the only
State without a Labor Government. Yet
within a couple of years the position was
reversed. The conscription-split toppled
most of the Labor Governments, but the
party held firm in Queensland, which for
a period had the only Labor Government
in Australia.
By 1930, shortly after Scullin became
Prime Minister, the pendulum had swung
back again. Labor was in office in N.S.W.,
Victoria, S.A. and Western Australia, but
in Queensland it had just made way for
the Liberal Moore Government. The
Liberals were also in office in Tasmania.
The depression of 1930 split the A.L.P.
again, but not only Labor Governments
fell. By June, 1932, the U.A.P. led by
J. A. Lyons, former Labor Treasurer,
had replaced the Scullrn Government in
Canberra, and, under B. S. B. Stevens,
had routed Jack Lang in N.S.W. Labor
Governments had also been defeated in
Victoria and Westralia, while in South
Australia, L. L. Hill, with his party split
in half, retained the Premiership by
courtesy of the Opposition he was
defeated the following year. In Queens-
land, Labor, under Forgan Smith, had
defeated the Moore Government. Only
the Tasmanian Government of John
McPhee survived an appeal to the electors
during that period. It won the 1931 elec-
tion, but went under in 1934, putting
Labor in power for a term not yet broken.
“Complete the Chain”
T abor’s big chance to bring all Aus-
tralia under Labor rule came in 1947.
The Chifley Government had recently
survived its first post-war election, in
which it had lost a few seats in the Reps,
but had for the first time gained control
of the Senate. There were Labor Govern-
ments in every State except South Aus-
tralia. Many of the wartime controls
were still in force, but a referendum to
make them permanent had been defeated.
An all-Labor Parliamentary pattern
would have provided the opportunity for
putting Labor’s socialisation plans into
action through a gentlemen’s agreement.
In March, 1947, there was a general
election in S.A., and the A.L.P. threw
all its resources into the fight to defeat
the L.C.L. Government. Propaganda
featured an appeal in the names of
Prime Minister Chifley and five Labor
Premiers, calling on the electors of South
Australia to “complete the chain.”
The metaphor was a trifle ambiguous,
and possibly the South Australian voters
thought they were being invited to accept
legirons. Anyway, they declined the
opportunity, put Tom Playford back for
another term, and have since watched
him grow in political stature and his
State in prosperity and industrial strength.
Rust and Age
Tf Labor came close to completing the
-*• chain under Chifley, under Evatt it has
watched it dwindle link by link. The
current problem is not whether Labor
can complete the chain, but whether it
can save even one link. Two of the
links are so old as to almost be classed
as venerable, if not antique. Labor has
been on the Treasury benches in Hobart
for 25 years ; in Sydney for 18. There’s
rust on the links, but the creaking sounds
that sometimes emanate from the
Cabinet-room in Macquarie Street come
not so much from rust as from ageing
bones and joints.
One of the things that will be work-
ing against the Cahill Government on
polling-day is the growing feeling that
it has been around the place too long.
More tangible factors are the D.L.P.
and, possibly, a Clive Evatt Labor party.
Candidates from these parties, with the
exception of Clive himself, are not likely
to win seats but, as in the Federal arena,
they are quite capable of losing Labor
a few seats —and Cahill can’t afford to
lose even a few.
In addition to the split in Labor ranks
he has several other adverse factors to
contend with, especially in vital country
electorates. There is resentment against
his road-tax ; against his Local Govern-
ment Minister’s policy on boundary-
adjustments. His touch-me-not reaction
whenever the breath of scandal falls on
any of his departments fans rather than
allays suspicions ; his half-baked equal-
pay bill, designed to catch the female
vote, seems to be in process of losing it.
All in all, Joe, as a link seems almost
due to be classified among the missing.
Other Links
Tn Westralia, politics have see-sawed
since the war. The Hawke Govern-
ment increased its majority at the 1956
election, but hasn’t increased its popu-
larity since. The bloom is off the boom
the Government was able to ride back to
power on three years ago, and at the
Federal election last November Labor
was able to hold only one seat, Fremantle.
The Westralian link in the Labor chain
seems rather worn and it is not exactly
strengthened by a local link with betting-
shops and s.-p. bookies.
Tasmanian Labor, the oldest link in the
chain, has a capacity for survival that
defies periodical scandals and royal com-
missions on Ministerial actions. The
electorate is almost evenly divided, and
unless the proposal to increase the
number of members in each electorate
from six to seven is adopted the present
state of parties—Labor, 15 ; Liberal, 15
—seems likely to be repeated in the next
Parliament, with a handful of votes
deciding which side will form the Govern-
ment. On Federal indications the privi-
lege would stay with Labor.
Labor’s chance of turning the tables
in S.A. can’t be entirely dismissed,
especially as the party has won two by-
elections in the last two years. But
Tom Playford has appeared to be in
danger before and has always got back.
His State is still riding high ; there’s an
oil-refinery about to be built, shipyard-
extensions are on the way and there’s
promise of a steelworks in the future.
There’s also the D.L.P. It would be
ironical if Labor were defeated in three
States this year, but prevented the L.-C.P.
from “completing the chain” by beating
Playford. But it doesn’t seem likely.

Sydney Form
In the spring Bold Pilot won
the Rosehill Guineas after
close seconds in the Chelmsford
Stakes and Canterbury Guineas,
and was given a chance to
prove staying ability in the
A.J.C. Derby. He failed at a
mile-and-a-half. This time up
he has shown top sprinting
form, with a short-half-head
second to crack two-year-old
Fine and Dandy, and a win
in the best Flying Handicap
company, both at Rosehill.
Before defeating Heroic Vic-
tory there by the barest margin
last Saturday, with Aura third,
in close to race-record time for
the seven furlongs, Bold Pilot
was popular for the Don-
caster, and the win, of course,
consolidated his position as
early first-choice for the Rand-
wick mile. He has 8.4 in the
Doncaster; he won with 8.8
at Rosehill.
Prince Kerdieil also was
strongly fancied for the Don-
caster before competing at
Rosehill, but he shaped so
poorly in the Flying that he
wouldn’t appear to have much
chance in the big mile (to be de-
cided on March 28). He was
quickly beaten, after being with
the lead to the straight. Chip-
perfield should benefit from the
run, his first since November
1, when he won a Flemington
sprint, while Grenoble’s effort
in fourth place pleased his
owner and trainer and drew
attention to his Doncaster
chance. He won last year’s
• Doncaster with 8.5; this time
he has 9.2 (he carried 9.5 at
Rosehill). He’s one that thrives
on racing, and he’s quickly
approaching best form.
Sea King, stylish winner of
Rosehill’s First Maiden for
two-year-olds, is a Ruthless-
(imp.)-Balgowlah gelding. It
was his third public outing. He
didn’t race till December 20,
at Randwick, when he went
out at 100 to 1 and finished
third to Noholme with a stable
apprentice in the saddle: G.
Moore had the mount on Satur-
day. Sea King is raced by E. B.
and J. Kornhauser. His dam,
Balgowlah, is by Bulandshar
(imp.) from Penelophon by
King Mark (imp.). He is bred
on the same cross as Hutton,
winner of 17 races and £23,255
in slakes.
Hooting of Jack Thompson,
rider of odds-on Valerius, who
was downed by three-year-old
gelding Bardshah in the Rose-
hill Auburn Stakes, wasn't
justified. He rode the colt in
the right manner to give him
a chance to win again at 10
furlongs, but Valerius wasn’t
equal to catching Bardshah,
who carried 9st., against 8.8 by
Valerius. The winner, smartly
handled by Ray Selkrig, raced
as an Encourage horse, while
Valerius was weighted as a
Novice. Bardshah had won
two prior races, one of them
at his previous outing at Rand-
wick on Anniversary Day,
when he defeated a field of 10
in a Novice Three-year-old,
carrying 8.7. He may have a
couple more starts before
tackling the best three-year-
olds in the A.J.C. St. Leger.
A model of consistency—
four wins and a third at his
last five starts —Irish Folly had
his first run at 10 furlongs
when he defeated Braemar and
Ruthless Don in the Rosehill
Handicap. He now looks a
likely Sydney Cup chance, and
certainly on breeding there’s
nothing against this improved
three-year-old winning at two
miles. At 7.11 he is nicely
weighted for the two-miler, and
trainer T. J. Smith —who won
two other races at Rosehill
(Sea King and Bold Pilot) —
believes the colt will prove a
worthy Cup contender. Irish
Folly is a son of Rolled Gold
(imp.), who is by Hyperion,
while his dam, Irish Eyes
(imp.), is by Blue Peter from
Sun Princess by Solario.
“Yair , that's him—the leading jockey in the State."
The Delta colors were re-
produced at Rosehill when
Happy Kingdom carried them
with distinction in winning the
Second Maiden Two-year-old
for colts and geldings. Handy
to the lead all the way, he led
from the home-turn. Time for
the six furlongs, 1.13 j, equalled
the race-record made in 1946
by Zambesi.' Adolph Basser
paid 4000gns. for the colt as
a yearling at the Randwick
auction. Happy Kingdom is
by Star Kingdom (imp.) from
New Flower by Nuffield from
Silver Flower by Silvern. A
likely improver among the also-
ran was Spectator, having his
first race-start.
Most Regal, a winner of the
Bendigo Cup and a minor
place-getter in both the Caul-
field and the Melbourne Cups,
and Sir Ross, winner of the
A.J.C. Summer Cup and second
in the Sydney Cup, are closely
related to Loquendi, runaway
winner of Rosehill’s Second
Parramatta Stakes in close to
record time. The Genetout
(imp.) gelding, who had filled
minor places at previous starts,
is from the Talking mare
Loquacity, whose dam, Teni-
sado, was by Silverado (imp.).
Geiger, an aged gelding, has
struck a purple patch of form
on Sydney tracks. He won at
Orange about a month ago,
then finished second to Hubbub
at Rosehill. A couple of weeks
later he won at Canterbury,
and three days after that was
successful in Saturday’s Rose-
hill Welter, in which a 61b.
penalty took his weight to 8.10.
In his last five starts he has
been ridden by five different
jockeys, but he raced well for
most of them, missing a place
only once. N. McGrowdie had
the mount at Rosehill. Despite
his fine win three days earlier,
there wasn’t much money for
Geiger, who eased from 8 to 1
to 14’s and started at 12’s. He
defeated Pardy and Damaji.
The street-corner tip for
Sonar King in the First Maiden
Two - year - old at Rosehill
almost came off. He had
shown galloping ability, but as
he went to the starting-barrier
he looked on the burly side
and was heavily bandaged on
both hind legs. The colt, who
cost 4700gns. at the Randwick
yearling-sales last April, is by
Star Kingdom (imp.) from
Echo by Double Remove
(imp.), and his winning-turn


seems close at hand. Inexperi-
ence contributed to his defeat.
Beaten horses at Rosehill
who might soon do better
include Sonar King, Gemstone,
Wolarma, Spectator, Gay Jack,
Grenoble, Cuban Tan and
Great Blaze.
V. P. Bernard—one of the
most-travelled of Australian
trainers ; likely to bob-up in
the least-expected places with
a smart galloper ; he has won
races on various country tracks
and on most metropolitan
courses —sprung a surprise on
Canterbury Park backers at the
midweek meeting when Fuss,
an English-bred five-year-old,
won the Welter at odds of
about 33 to 1. Just when the-
heavily supported Tapu
appeared to have the sprint in
his keeping, N. Sellwood
brought Fuss with a brilliant
finish in the centre of the track
to win for owner Stanley
Wootton. Fuss won three races
over short distances in Eng-
land, but the Canterbury sur-
prise was his first Sydney
success. Some weeks ago Fuss
was beaten in a modest Ballarat
(Vic.) sprint. Bernard started
him in the Epsom Handicap
won by Turkestan, but he beat
only one home. There were no
prospective champions in the
Canterbury Welter field. Ber-
nard’s best Sydney win was
with Commodore in the 1954
Metropolitan.

Af the Valley
Racing at Moonee Valley
last Saturday justified the old
saw “Wet track, don’t back.”
Results in most events, in-
cluding the main race, the
£l5OO mile Gisborne Handicap,
favored the books. The six-
year-old Bustard gelding
Buzzie took the Gisborne, first
time he had won a race since
scoring in the two-mile Inker-
man Handicap at Caulfield in
January last year. Jack Pur-
tell’s experience had a lot to
do with Buzzie's win. He held
the gelding back in last place
to the half-mile, then took the
long way home very wide on
the track. While the leaders
were floundering in the mud
along the straight, Buzzie
raced home strongly down the
grandstand side.
Racegoers at the Valley
were given warning of the
state of the track —and the
shape of things in store for
them —when outsider Makiwi
took 1.16 1/10 (6sec. outside
the course record) to run the
6 furlongs less 20yds. of the
first Preston Handicap. The
winner, a chestnut filly by
Makarpura from Entrancing,
had raced three times previ-
ously without showing any-
thing. Apparently she appreci-
ated the sting out of the track
and the longer distance ; she
raced very strongly over the
last couple of furlongs, and
won with a lot in hand.
Trainer Phil Burke, son of
former great mentor Bill
Burke, prepares Makiwi, who
was his 19th winner for the
season. Burke heads the
trainers’ list and looks like
winning the premiership for
the first time.
Last September this page
forecast that Sir Lorrient
would be the outstanding Mel-
bourne two-year-old when the
“baby” races came around. As
it happened, Sir Lorrient had
only one race in the spring,
when he ran second to an
extra-good one in Sartorial
Splendour. Owner Dave White-
side then put the colt away
until a couple of weeks ago,
when he ran in the Matthew
Flinders Handicap at the
Valley. Sir Lorrient’s effort
in that race was too bad to
be true ; it was later revealed
that he “swallowed his tongue”
during the race. In the second
Preston at the Valley last
Saturday he raced with his
tongue tied down, and showed
his true quality to career away
for a five-lengths win.
Reg Ansett was one of the
few people at the Valley not
surprised when 33-to-l chance
Red Braid led the field home
in the mile Yuroke Handicap
for three-year-olds. Ansett
bred and races the gelding, who
is from Aiming High by Bob
Major. Red Braid won a
Maiden at Mornington—
Ansett’s home-district last
month. Ray Webster trains
Red Braid on the Pakenham
course, where he used to pre-
pare another Bob Major
youngster —the ill-fated Sand-
hurst, who had to be destroyed
just when he looked like
developing into one of the best
gallopers in the land.
Possibly one of the reasons
for Prince Djafar’s long price
—l4 to I—in1 —in the first division
of the Glenroy Handicap was
that trainer Jack McCarthy
must have almost despaired of
ever again winning a race in
the metropolitan area ; it was
more than two years since he’d
done so. The five-year-old
Djafar gelding’s form was fair
Faith in the
Future
This is Queensland’s centenary year, and I
believe there is a lesson for our own time in the
story of how the boundaries of that great State were
drawn a hundred years ago.
It is well known that, but for second thoughts
on the part of the New South Wales authorities,
the original Queensland would have included the
rich districts of the Northern Rivers and
New England.
An equally significant fact—as indicating how
little the real potential of Australia was then
understood—is that most of the western border of
Queensland was extended out from the 141st.
meridian (which is still the outer line for both
N.S.W. and Victoria) to the 138th. meridian in
1862, less than three years after the new State
was proclaimed.
It was done on petition to London because
Queensland felt the need of a deep sea port in the
Gulf of Carpentaria ; and Point Parker, west of the
then drawn boundary, was the only feasible site.
So 120,000 square miles were added to
Queensland’s already large area on the signature of
the British Secretary of State for the Colonies.
And this additional territory included today’s
great Mount Isa mines, the Mary Kathleen uranium
field, and some of the choicest cattle lands
in Australia.
Now, it shouldn’t matter one jot, in the big
national sense, whether this State or that Territory
possesses now the means of enhancing our heritage.
The advancement of any quarter of our country
means the advancement of the whole.
But what we can learn from this flashback
on history is that a hundred years from now. those
who follow us may have even greater cause for
wonder that we foresaw so little of what is
unfolding around us.
The vision widens with every age, and aid.
and opportunity.
It is the active Faith we exhibit in Australia
now that will mark the worthiness with which we
can claim to have held and enjoyed it through the
passing years.

The Trots
Little Admiral, starting at
50-to-l and from the second
line, won the first division of
the Qualifying Stakes at Harold
Park on Saturday night in a
photo-finish from Wanganella.
Comerton Globe came from
seventh at the bell to finish,
wide out, only a half-head
away in third possie.
The first heat of the Youth-
ful Stakes for two-year-old
pacers had a very mixed
start. Iwunda shot clear early
*and led throughout, to win by
five lengths from Major
Express, with Mayfield Scott
two lengths further back.
Caffyn-trained Silver Nook,
favorite at 6 to 4, was badly
interfered with at the start, and
was never a possibility after-
wards. Iwunda’s time, 2min.
lljsec., was a record for the
race.
The second heat of the
Youthful Stakes saw another
ragged start, and, as well, just
as they passed the winning-
post with a lap to go, English
Raider fell and Netherby
Queen blundered into him,
pitching driver O’Shea heavily
to the track. Favorite at
6-to-4 on, Great Cheer got
away well from the rails posi-
tion, and came on in the
straight to win by three
lengths from Sky Main, with
Frypan two lengths further
back. Great Cheer’s time,
2.10 f, beat the record put up
in the previous race. Both
Great Cheer and Frypan are

Flingo got away smartly and
went on to an easy win in the

and was three lengths in front
at the post. Favorite Bangaroo
Lass was hopelessly left at the
start.

Final Test
Friday the 13th —opening
day of the fifth Test in Mel-
bourne-brought no great
luck to England. For a start,
May lost his first toss of the
series, though he was presented
with first use of the creases.
From then on England’s
innings was a more-or-less
sorry procession, redeemed
only by the previously hapless
Richardson’s fighting 68, an
enterprising though too brief
innings by Cowdrey, and an
eighth-wicket stand of 63 by
Trueman and newcomer
Mortimore (who made 44 not-
out).
England, after being all out
for 205, fought back on Satur-
day, and got rid of Burke for
16 (though he usually stays for
a while, Burke has not been a
big scorer this series). Then
Harvey (13) and O’Neill went
off successive balls from True-
man. McDonald and a typi-
cally dour Mackay held the
fort, and had recovered some
of the position by stumps.
Two of the widest wides ever
bowled in first-class cricket
were sent down on the first
day of the Test—one by Rorke,
one by Meckiff. Both speedsters
are certainly erratic; which
might help to explain some of
their success the batsman
never knows where the ball is
coming next. Be that as it may,
when either does get a straight
one it’s likely to be fast enough
to beat any batsman. The
crash of stumps is heard often
from both bowlers.
Lindwall’s 100th wicket in
England-Australia Tests was
Bailey’s, taken in the fifth 1954-
55 Test in Sydney. The dis-
missal bore all the hallmarks
of a “presentation.” Appro-
priately or not, the wicket by
which Lindwall equalled Grim-
mett’s 216-wicket Test tally
was also Bailey’s, caught off
Lindwall’s first ball in the
fifth Test. There was no
“presentation” this time. Lind-
wall, incidentally, though play-
ing in more Tests than Grim-
mett, has bowled fewer balls.
“Spinifex”: At least twice
during the Tests the umpire
signalled “one short run” when
three runs were essayed, so
only two runs were scored. I
suppose the rule-book says that
one short should be signalled,
but 1 find it difficult to under-
stand. The third run must
have been completed or one
of the batsmen would be on
his way to the pavilion ; there-
fore one of the runners must
have turned before completing
the first or the second run. In
either event there would be two
short runs, because, if the
forward journey from A to B
was short, then the return over
the same ground must neces-
sarily also be short. The
umpire’s signal should be “two
short runs.”
* * *
“Veryl”: Neil Harvey, in
slips, let a very difficult uppish
snick from brother Ray, when
22, go past him (in the recent
N.S.W.-Victoria Shield match
in Sydney); soon afterwards
let a ground snick from Shaw
go through, and the batsmen
ran three. Raucous yell from
the Hill (suspicion engendered
by all those who change sides,
perhaps): “Who you playing
for, Harvey, New South Wales
or Victoria?” Incidentally,
Ray Harvey, after being
dropped from Victoria’s team
since 1954-55, has made a
successful return —97 against
S.A., 86 against N.S.W.

Other Sports
One or two highlights of
Saturday’s races at the Austra-
lian swimming championships
in Hobart:
John and lisa Konrads each
chalked-up a good win. John easily
won the 220yds. freestyle (in 2min.
3.35ec., just outside his world-
record), while lisa equally easily
defeated American girl Chris von
Saltza in the 440yds. freestyle. lisa’s
time (4min. 50.25ec.) has been
bettered only twice —by Lorraine
Crapp (4.48.6, jn October, 1956)
and by lisa herself (4.49.4, at the
1958 Empire Games).
The 220yds. women’s medley was
won by the other American girl,
Sylvia Ruuska, in Australian-record
time of 2.40.3. Dawn Fraser was
second. The 220yds. women’s back-
stroke was won by Queenslander
Ann Nelson.
The 110yds. men's breaststroke
v/ent to N.S.W. country lad Terry
Gathercole, who has won the
national 110yds. and 220yds. breast-
stroke every year since 1954. The
440yds. medley relay was won by
N.S.W. (Hayres, backstroke; Wil-
kinsqn, butterfly; Gathercole,
breaststroke; Devitt, freestyle).
Queenslander David Theile, who
won the 100-metres backstroke at
the 1956 Olympic Games, won the
110yds. backstroke event. Theile
first won this Australian title in
1955, but retired from competitive
swimming to concentrate on his
studies soon after the Olympic
Games, leaving the backstroke field
to John Monckton, who had finished
second to Theile in the Olympic
event and who won the 1957 and
1958 national titles as well as the
1958 Empire Games 110yds. back-
stroke. Monckton, who is still
world-record holder over 110yds.,
220yds. and the metrical distances,
has now retired.

At West Melbourne on
Friday night classy Israeli
lightweight David Oved com-
pletely outfought a well-below-
par Max Carlos. Trainer-
manager Ambrose Palmer
threw in the towel at the end
of the 11th round, and Carlos
later announced his retirement
from the ring. Carlos, who
turned professional in Feb.,
1957, won the Australian light-
weight title from George
Bracken on July 4, 1958, in a
close contest, but since then
has not won —he’s fought a
draw with Russell Sands, was
outclassed by the South
African welter Johnny van
Rensburg (though the S’African
had no weight advantage in
this bout) and was beaten nar-
rowly on points by George
Bracken, who ought now to
recover his crown. Oved won
his two earlier fights in Aus-
tralia eight - round t.k.o.
defeat of Russell Sands in Mel-
bourne on Dec. 12 and an easy
points win over disappointing
Italian Franco Rosini on Jan.

over 15 rounds.


UNCABLED
ADDITIONS
THE TWENTY-FIRST CONGRESS
Come editorial reactions to
Premier Khrushchev’s in-
augural address to the 21st
Congress of the Soviet Com-
munist Party:
The Economic Plan
London ‘‘Financial Times” :
“There is no doubt whatso-
ever that the new plan will
bring some impressive results.
But it seems equally certain
that there will be some short-
falls. Western observers feei
that fulfilment of the planned
increases in the chemical
industry, in agriculture, and in
some sectors of the consumer-
goods industry a repeatedly
poor performer—is unlikely.
In addition, despite the grow-
ing application of automation
in Soviet industry which the
plan envisages, the present
labor shortage will be difficult
to overcome. Mr. Khrushchev
is personally—and solely-
associated with the Soviet
Union’s economic progress
now, and any significant
failures could cause him no
little trouble.”
* * *
London “Economist” : “By
emphasising Mr. Khrushchev’s
promise to eliminate income-
tax, foreign correspondents
have made him into a sort of
Soviet Poujade crusading
against- taxation. But in a
country where the State directly
controls the level of wages, the
raising of income-tax always
seemed a duplicating operation.
Even now it accounts for less
than eight per cent, of the
Budgetary revenue, which
comes chiefly from the indirect
turnover-tax and a levy on the
profits of State enterprises.
The gradual abolition of
income-tax, if unaccompanied
by a levelling of wages, would
go against the recent egalitarian
trend. This pledge is certainly
not the most welcome part of
the new deal for most
Russians.”
* * a?
London ‘‘Daily Mail” : “It
would be foolish to minimise
the great industrial and
astronautical achievements of
Russia and her enormous
potential. It is well within the
power of her people to hit
Khrushchev’s targets. We
sincerely hope they do. The
appalling backwardness of the
toiling Communist masses is a
reproach to the 20th century.
The sooner they reach modern
standards the better for man-
kind.”
* * *
London “Spectator” :
“Khrushchev is now in an
equivocal position. He is
attempting to run an auto-
cracy by consent. In the long-
run this has never proved
possible in a literate society. It
has often been tried in the
past. Sometimes the experiment
has gone on for some years,
tottering from shift to shift,
from ‘liberalisation’ which
—London "Evening Standard.”
"COMRADES! LOOK—THINGS HAVE HAPPENED SINCE LAST WE MET. ..”
leads to pressure for real
liberty, to repression which
leads to explosions. Regimes
of this sort are always transi-
tional, however impressive they
may look at a given moment.
“The whole trend of the
Soviet economy, of Soviet
society in general, is towards
something more glorious.
Khrushchev’s regime may well
turn out to have been the
Communist equivalent of Louis
PhilippeV bourgeois monarchy
a makeshift compromise
between one-man rule and rule
by consent. Khrushchev can
be either a citizen or a king.
The choice he makes will affect
us all. Meanwhile every success
his economic plans achieve
makes the Soviet Union less
suited to the party bureaucracy.
Either way, as Marx said of
capitalism, it is digging its own
grave.”
* * *
Paul Bureau, in London
‘‘News Chronicle” : “In many
ways, and particularly in the
amount of new capital it pro-
vides for industrial develop-
ment and in the monetary
incentives it gives to the upper
classes of the industrial and
administrative workers, Com-
munist Russia is being more
capitalist than most of the
capitalist nations.”
Russia and the West
‘‘Yorkshire Post”: “There
was a passage in Mr. Khrush-
chev’s mammoth report to the
congress that gave ground for
disquiet. His new Seven-year
Plan, he said, ‘when fulfilled,
will so greatly increase the eco-
nomic potential of the U.S.S.R.
that it will give peace a decisive
edge in the international
balance of power. The peace-
ful nations will be able to
compel militant imperialist
groups to abandon their plans
of a new world war.’ What
does this mumbo-jumbo mean?
Mr. Khrushchev knows per-
fectly well that no ‘imperialist
groups’, have any world-war
plans to abandon. They have,
however, certain principles
which they will not abandon.
To refuse to abandon them is
not to plan war.
“Conversely, to threaten those
principles is not to campaign
for peace. Mr. Khrushchev’s
proposition seems to be that
only ‘Socialism’ is peace, that
anybody who hinders the
world spread of ‘Socialism’ is
a war-plotter, and that in seven
years or so the ‘Socialist’
‘peaceful’ nations will be able
to compel all other countries
to yield to them. If that is the
correct interpretation of this
double-think, Newspeak lan-
guage of Mr. Khrushchev's,
then we of the West have the
most urgent duty to see that the
Communist economic challenge
is met in good time.”
» * *
“Manchester Guardian” :
“Communism, in his [Khrush-
chev’s] hands, is almost: emptied
of all ideological content other
than this song of plenty to
come—but it is the song the
people want to hear, in Asia
and Africa as well as at home,
The rest of us ought to heed
the warning. Not only have
we to convince the poor
countries that our way to plenty
is at least as good as the Com-
munists’ violent methods. We
should also compare our own
performance with that which
Mr. Khrushchev hymns in
advance. How many science-
graduates shall we have in
1965? And how many tens
of thousands of miles of Soviet

railways will have been electri-
fied by the time the current
flows from Manchester to
Crewe or Euston.”
* * *
London “New Statesman” :
“Stalin’s slogan was ‘Tighten
your belts, comrades’: Khrush-
chev’s is ‘Good appetite, com-
rades.’ If he can fulfil his pro-
mises of an easier, more
prosperous life, now that the
‘building of Communism’ has
commenced, then peaceful com-
petition will indeed be more
than a slogan. The targets may
seem ambitious, but they do
not seem unattainable: the rate
at which the Soviet economy
is now growing, both abso-
lutely and relative to Western
industrial societies, offers a
challenge which cannot be
ignored.
“If Soviet agriculture can
be developed more rapidly, and
if there is no setback to
Khrushchev’s somewhat risky
ventures in the virgin lands,
Soviet citizens will at long last
begin to reap the rewards of
40 years of grinding labor.
This success is one reason for
Khrushchev’s ebullient confi-
dence: the increasing strategic
power of the Soviet Union is
the other. But to carry out
these plans he undoubtedly
needs to reduce international
tension and to limit the
resources consumed by the
armaments race.”
* * *
London “Economist” : “The
slogan remains ‘to catch-up
with America.’ Mr. Khrush-
chev has now claimed that in
output per head this should be
achieved five years after the
end of the current plan, that is
to say about 1970. This boast
naturally neglects the com-
petitor's performance. Never-
theless, Mr. Khrushchev seems
absolutely convinced that in
the not-so-distant future the
Soviet Union will take the lead
in the economic race and that
this will ensure the ultimate
victory of Communism. He
did not, however, forget about
armaments. He quoted Soviet
exploits in space as proof of
the deadly accuracy of Soviet
rockets, while asserting that
intercontinental missiles are
now in serial production. But
he also emphasised Russia’s
anxiety to disarm, which he
described as the ‘task of tasks.’ ”
* * *
• London “Financial Times” :
“Perhaps the most significant
“Manchester Guardian."
“IF YOU ASK ME, THEY'RE ACTING LIKE A BUNCH
OF COMMUNISTS.”
feature of the Seven-year Plan,
assuming most of its targets are
met, is that it may well result
in greatly increased Soviet
participation in world trade. In
the first place, Russia could
have sizeable exportable sur-
pluses of non-ferrous metals —
and the effect which these
could have on world markets
has already been seen in the
case of tin.
“Secondly, the Soviet con-
centration on capital-goods,
without a corresponding in-
crease in its consumer in-
dustries, could bring about
greatly increased exports of
these goods. Such a develop-
ment would clearly be of great
importance in Russia’s rela-
tions with the less-developed
countries, to whom it would
look for its major customers,
and may present far more of
a problem to the West than any
foreseeable ‘catching-up’ with
the U.S would do.”
* * *
London “Evening Standard”:
“But every new block of flats,
every new steel-plant, every
new power-station put up under
Khrushchev’s Seven - year
Plan will sharpen the Russian
people’s anxiety to avoid any
policy which might bring the
risk of war. Producing more
refrigerators may turn out to
be a better way of discourag-
ing aggression than . signing
treaties. The emphasis on eco-
nomic competition and expan-
sion in Mr. Khrushchev’s
speech should, therefore, be
welcomed. It will not neces-
sarily make the Russians more
pliant in negotiation. It will
certainly not make them any
readier to abandon their ambi-
tions. But it gives them an
incentive to avoid a head-on
clash. It offers a challenge
which the West can accept —
and the prospect of a contest in
which all the participants can
benefit.”
Russia and China
London “Tide and Tide”:
“The spectre at the feast in
Moscow is Mao Tse-tung—
absent but ever present. China
has sent a delegation of second-
string men, headed by Chou
En-lai, third in the Chinese
hierarchy, to this most im-
portant congress. Perhaps
memories of Mongolian, Polish
and other comrades who,
attending former congresses,,
found the Moscow air un-
suited to their constitutions and
developed sudden and fatal
illnesses, affected Mao Tse-
tung’s decision. Or perhaps he
is underlining his own position
of independence by not
travelling to Moscow to accept
the Russian party whip.”
* * *
“Yorkshire Post ” : “There is
some evidence that Mr. Mao’s
attitude is one of rather
sharper hostility to Mr.
Khrushchev than that of the
majority of the Central Com-
mittee of the Chinese Com-
munist party, which he still
heads. Mr. Mao has claimed
that his invention of agricul-
tural communes (which Russia
tried and hastily dropped soon
after the revolution) was just
such an example, and was,
moreover, a short-cut to full
Communism bypassing the
long and painful Russian road.
With Mr. Mao’s resignation
from the Premiership has come
a measure of back-pedalling by
Peking on the campaign to
bring all the Chinese peasants
into these communes, and those
that have been set up have had
some of their rigors ameli-
orated. Yet they remain a
cornerstone of Chinese Com-
munist theory and practice,
despite Mr. Khrushchev’s
scornful description of them—
to the American Senator
Humphrey at that as ‘old-
fashioned.’ The rift remains,
and it is the hidden or rather
half-hidden keynote of this
week’s Congress of the Soviet
Communist Party.”
* * *
London “Daily Telegraph” :
“For all their protestations of
solidarity at the current con-
gress, the two great Communist
Powers have some divergent
interests which will grow more
important with time. Foreign
policy apart, it is significant
that Mr. Khrushchev should
have said so little of what the
Soviet economy is now doing
to help the Chinese. When he
implies that the Soviet Union
and China (which is a good 20
years behind) will achieve
Communism at the same time,
he is assuming demands on the
resources of his own country
which would make nonsense of
much of the new Seven-Year
Plan.”

so far as China is concerned,
Khrushchev was doubtless
right to ridicule the view that
Moscow organises and governs
Communist parties elsewhere.”
Western Samoa
COMMENTING Oil N.Z.’s
virtual promise of self-
government to Western Samoa
next year and the invitation
of a U.N. inspecting mission
next month, “Manchester
Guardian” notes that “New
Zealanders undoubtedly will be
glad to be rid of responsibility
for a territory which profits
them little or nothing and
where they, like other white
men, are highly unpopular.
Unfortunately it is most doubt-
ful whether the Samoans are
ready for the sort of self-
government which the majority
of the United Nations would
like to see”:
“There are two big obstacles
to be overcome if Western
Samoa is to have much chance
of happy independence. First,
the economy is far too de-
pendent on the world prices of
copra, cocoa, and bananas,
and there appears to be little
local enthusiasm for the hard
work necessary to achieve
maximum production and effi-
ciency. Secondly, the Samoans
seem ill-prepared for the sort
of democracy which most of
the United Nations probably
wish to see. Far too few have
sufficient experience of admini-
stration or technical knowledge
for government to be likely to
run smoothly. Far too much
still depends on tribal chiefs.
Indeed, two of the three
families of the highest chiefs
are busy now in a struggle for
power, and each of them is
backed by a number of
European businessmen.
“There is grave danger that
if the New Zealand adminis-
tration is withdrawn pre-
maturely this inter-tribal
rivalry may lead to civil dis-
order of the worst sort in which
the interests of tribal sections
and their foreign backers
would be at stake with little
thought for the interests of the
community at large. The
United Nations mission will do
well not to be blinded by the
attraction of the magic word
self-government when it should
be considering whether the
Samoans have made sufficient
economic, technical, and
administrative progress for
them to have a reasonable
chance of looking after them-
selves successfully.”
India's Role
Commenting on the Duke of
Edinburgh’s tour of India,
“Edinburgh Scotsman” re-
marks that “India remains the
great upholder of Parlia-
mentary democracy in the East.
The fate of the whole demo-
cratic idea perhaps depends
very largely on her, for it now
seems all too likely that the
forms of government evolved
by us will not survive unless
they prove capable of applica-
tion in places remote from
their source”:
“Frequent and anxious com-
parisons are made with Com-
munist China, where the rate of
obvious progress is greater.
The solution of economic
problems never seems to wait
on the disentanglement of
social knots, for a Communist
regime cuts the knots instead
of disentangling them. This
violent course does produce
results of a certain kind,
results of the kind India sorely
needs in terms of work done
and food grown. It is perhaps
the quickest course, because in
satisfying the most pressing
wants of human-beings it
ignores all others.
“India has chosen a path
which must be slower because
it considers human-beings. It
gives them real consideration
instead of the sham considera-
tion accorded by Communist
regimes. Of course there are
gaps and inadequacies and
failures, but the strength of the
intention cannot be mistaken.
It runs all through Indian
society. It is particularly
noticeable in the young, who
unsparingly criticise the short-
comings. From such dissatis-
faction will come the force to
implement the new five-year
plans and. gradually adjust
Indian society to economically
sound methods. The deep
strength of India is in the
respect for human-beings
which Communist societies
lack.”
Various Voices
Sir Winston Churchill: “The
freer the pound the easier it is
for th.e City of London to
maintain its position as a great
money market with all the
benefits which accrue to the
whole country from this posi-
tion. I myself think that this
is a great step forward. I look
forward to the time when the
pound is as freely and uni-
versally circulated as was the
gold sovereign and is as much
sought-after by foreign
countries.”
* * *
Mr. Dulles: “International
Communism avowedly seeks
world-wide dictatorship. The
free world and Communist
concepts are mutually antagon-
istic. This, however, does not
mean that there cannot be
useful contacts and negotia-
tions with the Communists.
The tide of freedom is running
strong in Western Europe as
Communist strength there ebbs.
Even in the U.S.S.R. revision-
ism is a living force and fer-
ment. Moscow considers it a
deadly enemy, and with reason.
As we look ahead, we see
freedom as a predominant
force, shaping our twentieth-
century world.”
* * *
Mr. C. F. Cobbold (Gover-
nor of the Bank of England):
“There are many things which
have a temporary effect on the
reserves and sterling—borrow-
ing and lending, ebb and flow
of confidence, the relative
attraction of investment in one
market or another. But under-
lying all this is one simple and
permanent fact. The level of
reserves and the strength of
sterling depends on our earn-
ing more abroad than we spend
abroad. For the country, as
for the individ lal, if we spend
more than we earn we shall
get into trouble—no gimmick
and no loans or overdrafts will
long keep us out of it.”

beside a country road, he said.
What’s more, something a
good deal short of professional
knowledge and about thirty-
quids’ worth of equipment are
all you need to cut and polish
a majority of them in your
own home . . .
If your first reaction is that
this must be an unusual
jeweller—almost as though a
butcher had advised you to cut
the tucker-bill by grazing lamb
on the lawn, or a spokesman
for a brewery upped and urged
beer-drinkers to brew their own
—well, that’s pretty well how
I reacted when Jack S. Taylor,
in the office of his jewellery
business on the third-floor of
164 Pitt Street, started talking
about the joys and economy of
collecting Australian gem-
stones.
Jack Taylor is founder and
president of the New South
Wales Lapidary Club, whose
members, drawn from many
walks of life, regularly collect
and finish gemstones as a
hobby. He is also a jeweller,
a trained gemmologist (gem-
mology is the scientific study of
differences in gemstones), and
is one of the foundation-
members of the Gemmological
Association of Australia, of
which he was the first Federal
secretary and is now a life-
member.
A second reaction (or maybe
a first) could be a wild
impulse to snatch your time
and head bush, looking for the
equivalent of a sheep-station
or a pub—or even the price of
a house or a car —among the
goolies and gibbers you kicked
along some bush track in the
age of innocence.
Didn’t some of them have
remarkable shapes and colors,
now you come to think about
them?
And then again, according
to temperament, a third, second
or first reaction could be to
pose that common, but usually
necessary, question: What’s
the catch?
'T'here is no catch. Jack
Taylor and his Lapidary
Club cobbers just like collect-
ing gemstones, and are willing
An Australian opal valued at £83,034 was recently
displayed in New York.
The opal, which weighs 320,000 carats, was found
at Andamooka (S.A.), and sold for an undisclosed sum
to an American dealer, Elliott Glasser, by a Sydney
dealer, who is reported to have paid about £1306 for it.
to help others to take-up what
they claim is a fascinating and
inexpensive hobby. He men-
tioned that in the U.S.A.,
where lapidary clubs have
been going for some time, do-
it-yourself cutting, polishing
and prospecting amongst gems
ranks second to stamp-collect-
ing as a popular hobby.
But the gemstones picked up
on weekend expeditions are not
the sort that adorn rajah’s
turbans —it isn’t as easy to get
rich quick as all that. Even
so, some of the inexpensive
gemstones lying around the
continent are very beautiful
indeed, as a glance at the speci-
mens under glass in Jack
Taylor’s shop shows: well
worth the trouble of collecting
and polishing. In fact, he calls
Australia “an untapped
treasure-house.”
Every gem except the ruby
has been found here
diamonds, sapphires, emeralds,
pearls, turquoises and Aus-
tralia’s specialty in the precious-
stone line, the opal. And all
these, of course, are fairly
pricey. Where is the lady who
is going to turn up her nose at
a nice handful of any of them?
Especially if they are nicely
finished?
And that, too, could be one
of the attractions of the hobby
—as an alternative to, say,
fishing or golf. Pleasant as it
may be to come home and give
a stroke-by-stroke account of
how you finally pipped old
Jones, it might create a better
impression to say, casually,
“Oh, by the way, dear, I found
a few diamonds this arvo.
Thought you might like them.”
Better, even, than bringing
home a fish. Some wives don’t
care for fish.
unfortunately,
aren’t plentiful this season,
Taylor said with a smile. On
the other hand, on one expe-
dition he had picked up a black
star-sapphire which he valued
at £500; it was the second-
largest black star - sapphire
found in Australia.
“Just a question of knowing
where to look,” he said quietly.
As another example of
knowing where to look—and
what to look for —a lady
picked up approximately £ 100-
worth of sapphires in May this
year, on a Lapidary Club trip
to Nullamanna, in the N.S.W.
New England. Taylor said
that this member found five
sapphires. He had cut one,
which he valued at around £5O,
and he thought the others,
when cut, would be worth
another £5O.
Another example was a piece
of opal “as big as that hat”
picked up at Lightning Ridge.
The hat —mine —was lying on
his desk. Size, I\.
Which indicates another pos-
sible advantage—the trips tend
to be family affairs. Women,
anyway, have shown an under-
standable interest in choosing
their own gems in the field.
TTovv did it all start?
Jack S. Taylor, who is
48 but could pass for 10 years
younger with no trouble at all,
leaned back in his chair and
told me: a quietly enthusiastic
man with a humorous twist to
his enthusiasm, quick in his
movements, but able to relax,
medium height, solidly built, a
narrow tie a strip of subdued
color against dazzling white
shirt, sleeves neatly rolled,
craftsman’s hands lying loose
on the table, ready for their
specialised work. A general
impression of workmanlike
competence without bustle.
His father was a jeweller, as
was his grandfather, who came
here from England and estab-
lished the family business. After
he left Sydney Grammar, Jack
Taylor spent two years in a
lapidary workshop, then went
on to other aspects of a
jeweller’s trade, including the
gemmology course, which is a
strictly professional one.
Gemmology, too, is fairly
new. In the old days individual
jewellers, particularly in Hol-
land and Germany, had great
reputations as judges of
precious stones. But later tests
indicated that the old-timers
often erred, and the application
of scientific principles to the
evaluating and identification of
gems has been found more
reliable than traditional know-
ledge, which, in any case,
involved a fair amount of guess-
work. Not all jewellers are
gemmologists. But nowadays
(N.S.W. jewellers’ president K.
Walsh told me) most well-
established jewellers, if they are
not themselves gemmologists,
employ a qualified gemmolo-
gist.
Well, after serving in the
Army in War II Jack Taylor
began to take his family away
for weekends in the country,
and, being interested in gems,
had a look at various fields
where gems had been found.
He knew from his specialised
reading that Australia had a
wide range of gemstones, but
about this time he began to
read everything on the subject
he could lay his hands on.
He visited more fields, and

“JACKSUL,” BRISBANE
came to the conclusion that
Australians had “only scratched
the surface” of the mineral
wealth in the country. (Gems,
of course, are minerals.)
Tnvited, in 1952, to talk over
2GB about his trips, Taylor
was asked by Bill Weir
whether it was possible for
amateurs to learn to recognise
gemstones in the rough; he
said it was —that, in fact, he
had then already been toying
for some time with the idea of
starting a lapidary club on the
lines of the clubs in the U.S.
He had thought something like
this, should be done to popu-
larise Australian minerals.
Hard on the heels of the
broadcast came letters from
people interested in joining
such a club, and so the first
meeting of the New South
Wales Lapidary Club was held
—in February, 1953.
There are now 500 members,
most of whom live in N.S.W.;
about 100 live in other States,
or overseas.
The club’s short trips are
usually one-day jaunts one
month, two-days the next
month. The longer trips usually
take a week.
An example of a short excur-
sion would be the one on Eight-
hour Day weekend ; on that
outing a party of 85 fossicked
around Oberon for garnets,
sapphires and gold.
Another example is the trip
to Kiama in September, look-
ing for amethysts and agates,
spread over a Saturday after-
noon and a Sunday, with 80-
odd starters. Yet another,
searching for agate and petrified
wood in the Kangaroo Valley.
Apart from anything else,
what appeals to a good many
members is getting away from
the city occasionally, looking
at interesting country, with a
definite object not simply
bowling along a road aim-
lessly, swallowing other
motorists’ dust.
“To my mind it’s a perfect
hobby,” Taylor said. “In good
weather you get out in the
country ; in bad weather you
can sit at home and cut and
polish.”
'"The trip to Lightning Ridge
took a week. Fifty-four
members went, and all got
opals.
“Nobbies,” he told me ;
“little white stones you could
easily step over if you didn’t
know them.”
He showed me a handful,
with the color showing through
cuts made on the surface.
The Taylors took along their
daughter, aged three, on that
trip. He showed me a briefing-
chart, issued to members be-
fore they start on a trip. It
was very informative and
military—rendezvous, such and
such a place, with a map and
other details.
The trip to Nullamanna also
took a week. Nullamanna, 12
miles north of Inverell, has
one of the richest deposits of
sapphires in the country. It is
a new field, and Taylor is com-
mercially interested in it. But,
with the exception of a small
area where work was currently
in progress, the operating com-
pany opened the field to the
Lapidary Club for the trip. All
of them found sapphires!
- Some of the members are
keen to go to Ayers Rock next
year . . .
"Mearer Sydney—in fact, as
close as Prospect, out
Parramatta way—it is possible
to pick up something nice and
colorful . . . if, of course, you
know what you’re looking for.
And here, again, the Lapidary
Club comes in.
Under glass in the shop
proper is a range of gemstones
of every shape and color, a
kind of composite rainbow.
Most of the names I had never
heard, or, if 1 had heard some,
had only a dim idea of what
they signified.
“That’s just it,” said Taylor.
“People don’t know about
these things.”
As they struck me, here are
a few: Blue-and-white topaz
from Oban, on the New Eng-
land highway ; variegated
jasper from W.A.; spotted
jasper from South Australia,
very red, with white spots ;
green and blue azurite from
W.A.; golden and apple-green
prehnite, found mixed with
blue - metal at Prospect
(N.S.W.); pure white rock-
crystal, purple amethyst,
golden citrine, a kind of quartz,
smoky cairngorm, moss-agate
and —well, lots more.
Dull and flamelike pieces,
and intricate patterns and com-
binations of colors that defy
written description lying there
under glass.
Many of the less-well-known
gems have no great commercial
value. But, cut and polished,
how they could delight the eye
spread around the home!
Western Australia is rich in
opals, malachite, prase, jasper,
beryl, tourmaline and garnets,
and, in fact, many of the speci-
mens I saw came from W.A.
But, I was told, the New Eng-
land highway also has an
abundance of interesting gems:
sapphires, amethysts, quartz,
zircons, garnets, rhodanite,
emeralds, topaz, agates; and,
along the coast, opals . . .
Prase from South Australia,
the dominant color green ;
opalite (a kind of impure opal,
with dendrites through it);
magnificent green malachite
from Burra (W.A.).
Fascinating, as Taylor ex-
plained it. I learnt that mala-
chite is copper ; sapphires,
aluminium ; selenite, gypsum
(or plaster -of - paris). But
who’d have thought these
minerals could take such
astonishing forms?
A variety of opals—“practice
opals,” little fellows to learn
to cut on, kept in a drawer ;
boulder opal, matrix opal ;
rhodanites, pink, and pink and
black ; Queensland ribbon-
stone ; lepidoiite (a mica),
golden, purple and reddish
brown; and book-mica, used
in electrical equipment. Aus-
tralian lucky - stone ; and
chiastolite, in different patterns
of crosses.
Also a large “grass-stone,”
from Tingah (N.S.W.), which
looks like a crystal-ball with
blades of grass running through
it. It is quartz, with splinters
of rutile imprisoned in it.
"Out these, for the most part,
are the end-products. First,
the gemstones have to be col-
lected ; then cut and polished.
The rough stone is slit with
a diamond saw, and rough-
shaped on a coarse silicon-
carbide wheel ; then shaped
again on a finer silicon-carbide
wheel.
Next step is to smooth on a
silicon-carbide cloth. It is then
polished on a felt wheel with
pumice-powder, and finally
polished on a felt wheel with
putty-powder.
Equipment is relatively
simple an assortment of
wheels —and doesn’t take up
much space. It costs around
£3O for the complete works.
And Jack Taylor claims that
anyone of average handyman
ability can learn to polish most
gemstones. Faceting (for
diamonds and the like) is more
highly skilled work, but he says
some amateurs have learned
to do it.

Who wrote a book whose one page is all we recall ;
Each one of us an island that would not change
From insularity—oh ! my John, my Jo,
Nothing can tell us, there’s nothing we wish to know.
We read the black and white and endure the voice ;
We hear the news of the day before today ;
But the morning after the flash, the incredible flame,
There’s nothing we’ll know, and never a change or choice
To be made or disregarded—and oh! my pretty,

THE OTHER FELLOW'S MIND
Anoiher Gold Coast?
So far, nearly all Australian
“Gold Coast” ventures have
been concentrated on Barrier
Reef islands and a short stretch
of coastline around the
Queensland-N.S.W. border, but
a great opportunity lies on the
opposite side of the continent
at Carnarvon, W.A. In the
opinion of Americans who
were there during the last war,
few places in the world have
such advantages.
The winter climate is
marvellous. The sea teems with
fish, edible or big-game.
Further up the coast there is
an inexhaustible supply of
rock-oysters. Water pumped
from the great bed of sand in
the Gascoyne River now
irrigates extensive plantations
of tropical fruits.
Between the town and the
shore lies an area of sand-
dunes which could be trans-
formed by planting with palms,
shade-trees, flowering shrubs
and lawn-grass, as a site for
holiday accommodation. Many
world-famous Florida resorts
started with far less in the way
of natural resources.
The W.A. Government is
interested in the idea of making
a winter playground some-
where along this stretch of
coast, but it is to be hoped it
will avoid the errors —such as
over-exclusiveness, poor ser-
vice, and prohibitive prices
caused by a boom in land-
values —that have been made
elsewhere. The land-boom
blight could be overcome by
buying-up a large enough area
of land and letting it out on
fixed rentals to those who
build tourist accommodation.
And town-planning must
come into the picture. Time
and again resorts of this type
have been “improved” by
crowding them with buildings
until all the charm vanishes. —

Professors and' Creative
Writers
By not accepting my rough
figure of three-quarters, H. A.
Lindsay (B. 10/12/’5B) has not
really altered my contention
that a university education
can do much to burnish the
natural + talent of a creative
person. Thirty-eight poets
represented in the Penguin
Book of Australian Verse are
described as having a uni-
versity background. This is 70
per cent. Is the difference
worth arguing about?
It might also be noted that
23 of the 38 are in the second
half of the book. As the
authors appear in chronologi-
cal order (date of birth), it
could be held that as Aus-
tralian poets move further
away from the little bush
maiden waiting at the slip-
rails, or, in other words, as
“Send ’er down , pal!”
they become more poets and
less verse-reporters of scenery,
the trend is towards confirma-
tion of the value of a uni-
versity education.
It is irrelevant what courses
these poets undertook. What
is important is that training in
the use of their minds must
necessarily have improved
their creative ability.
Lindsay’s comment on the
excellence of teaching in
creative writing in America is
totally opposed to general
opinion in the U.K. and Aus-
tralia. The usual Arts course
at an American university
goes much further in teaching
creative writing than it does
in Australia, and concentrates
on instructing the students in
the physical task of getting
their material off their chests.
Most American universities
have text-books specially pre-
pared for the purpose. These
are often anthologies of the
works of the greatest writers,
with chapters showing what
the writer was after and how
he got his effects, and, more
important, constantly exhort-
ing the student to try some
particular method. I have not
seen a similar text-book for
Australian university students.

Power of the Commons
“P.O.M.C’s” claim that from
the reign of Henry VIII the
House of Commons “alone
has progressively moulded the
English into the greatest and
probably the most impartial
race on earth” (B. 28 /1 / ’59) is
far from true. It was not until
the 17th century that the Com-
mons began to show independ-
ence of the Crown ; and not
until the 19th century did it
really become the dominating
force in the Constitution.
Until the overthrow of
James 11, in 1688, the Crown
was sole director of national
policy, though Parliament
could influence it indirectly
through the bargaining-power
of its right to vote new taxes.
The advisers of the Crown did
not have to have a Commons
majority. Until the late 17th
century there was no fixed
term for a Parliament: many
years might elapse between
general elections; and some-
times several years passed

between sessions of the one
Parliament.
After the accession of
William 111 a new policy of
“management” of the Com-
mons was adopted. The
Crown—partly through seats
it controlled, partly through
buying influential politicians
with Ministerial posts, peer-
ages or sinecures—-sought to
get a Government majority.
This policy, which is well
described in Professor Pares’s
George 111 and the Poli-
ticians, was followed through-
out the 18th century. George I,
being unable to speak Eng-
lish and having no interest in
British domestic politics, placed
all his confidence in Sir Robert
Walpole, who turned “manage-
ment” into a fine art. He it
was who coined the saying
“Every man has his price.”
Walpole was allowed to fill
Ministerial posts with men he
could rely on —thus, in effect,
becoming the first Prime
Minister, though the practice
of commissioning one political
leader to form a Ministry com-
posed entirely of his own
nominees did not become regu-
lar until later. To the end of
the 18th century the Crown, in
the hands of a man like
George 111, who used Crown
patronage and influence in his
own interest, was a strong
independent force.
Up to the Reform Bill of
1832 the Commons was
strongly influenced, through
control of seats, not only by
the Crown but by members of
the House of Lords and by
economic pressure-groups, like
the East. India Company and
the West Indian planters. One
-Indian potentate, the Nabob of
Arcot, owned nine seats. A
number of members owned
their seats either through
inheritance or purchase,
Representation was unequal,
Cornwall, because it was a
royal duchy, and so subject to
Crown influence, returned as
many members as Scotland.
Important industrial towns like
Birmingham had no represen-
tation until the Reform Bill.
There were many seats with a
handful of voters some
returning two members. Vot-
ing was open until the 1870’s,
and the electorate was small.
No valid comparison can be
made between the pre-Reform
House of Commons and the
20th-century one. — Cunedda

Bus hfir e-fighting
It is disappointing that
science has given so little heip
in bushfire-fighting.
We have bomb - power
capable of devastating large
areas, rain-control schemes and
artificial satellites ; but when a
big bushfire starts we have little
more help than our grand-
fathers had.
A couple of ideas on which
a few millions might be well
spent: (1) A firebreak of endo-
thermic vegetation to cool the
blaze into, extinction. (2) A
guided blast from a fleet of
missiles or jets stopping or
turning the fire route, or turn-
ing the burnt gases back into
the flames.— Metax (Tas.).
The Australian Legend
The basic qualities of the
traditional Australian bush-
man —his independence, demo-
cratic outlook, resourcefulness,
loyalty to his mates, etc. —
don’t need to be explained by
his convict origin, as argued
in The Australian Legend (Red
Page 7/1/’59). The unsettled
life and working-conditions of
the bush would themselves
have tended to develop these
qualities.
And it is doubtful if most ex-
convicts had the character to
form the spearhead of a radical
bush tradition. Andrew
Petrie and T. A. Browne (“Rolf
Boldrewood”), who were well
acquainted with “old lags,’’
described them mainly as mild-
mannered, simple persons
whose prison experiences had
made them determined to keep
on the right side of the law.
“Rebel Irish” influence was
probably more important, but
its effect can be exaggerated.
Man V Australians and Britons
Protestant stock even when
inclined to be rebel-mindea
themselves, have a I'w ay s
reacted against the Catholic
]L" sb clement. I have known
English people, Labor sup-
porters in their homeland, who
m Australia have regularly
kf cau sethey
be d tbat tbe Catholic Irish had
too much to say m the A.L.P.
„ J°? m J uch , can „ be ™ ade A of
bush radicalism in the Aus-
tralian outlook . The outsack
ft as dominated Australian
literature, chiefly because it
represents a way of life alien
and exciting to dwellers in
big cities. Though the urban
middle-class has, for most of
Australia’s history, been
numerous and influential, until
reC ently it has figured hardly
a jj j n Australian literature,
Even today, though economic
and social trends have greatly
increased its strength, it is


relatively neglected by Aus-
tralian writers.
This class has a tradition
very different to the “radical”
bush tradition. It is essentially
conservative, approximately an
adaptation of English Tory
and middle-class values.
Loyalty to the Crown, support
of the link with the United
Kingdom, dislike of demagogy,
and of egalitarianism, are its
main features. Most regular
supporters of the non-Labor
parties have been, to a greater
or less degree, influenced by
it. — Farinmail (N.S.W.).
Road Safety
Will a national road plan
really save life? And what
authorities blame roads for a
large percentage of accidents
in Australia (B. 21/1/’59)?
The necessity for a nation-
wide system of trunk-roads
can be argued, but possible
saving of life is not one of the
arguments for it —not from my
observations, anyway ; nor
from statistics, which invari-
ably put speed at the top of
the list of killers. And where
can you speed, except on a
good road?
The town in which I live
is long and narrow. It has
seven straight roads on which
speeds of 50 m.p.h. and above
are possible and are frequently
reached, in spite of the 30-
m.p.h. limit. It also has
two principal roads with
several bends in them
some at right-angles along
which, in most places, speeds
of more than 30 are practically
impossible with comfort.
Nine out of ten car-smashes
in this town happen at intersec-
tions or other points on the
long, straight roads; for the
past four years not one smash
involving two or more cars
has happened on the bending
roads.
Examination of the overall
mental make-up of drivers in-
volved in accidents would
probably show that most of
them are constitutionally in-
capable of good driving, either
because of slow reflexes or
mental unbalance which shows
itself in bad temper or lack of
consideration for others.
It is far too easy to get a
driving-licence in Australia —
and far too easy to be served
with too many drinks when a
driving - licence has been
obtained. Since the only way
to learn to drive a car is to
drive it, licences have to be
issued to people who are not
really capable of controlling
the lethal machine they plan
to drive; but licences should
be made probationary for a
much longer period than the
present “learner’s” licence.
Proof that experience in
driving is a safeguard against
accidents is the fact that, in
comparison with the miles they
travel, commercial drivers and
taxi-drivers are involved in
far fewer accidents than
amateurs. —R.H. (Q.).
Fares and C.-0.-l.
There is only one way to
collect fares efficiently
through taxation.
Take the seats out of buses,
cram more in and provide
more straps. Then you could
sack all conductors and con-
ductresses and halve running-
costs. Add a bit on to taxa-
tion to pay for it; or, better
still, run an additional weekly
lottery—with first-prize a seat

THE MAN ON
THE LAND
"DON'T WORRY I'M SENDING IT TO
GRZCOS."
Bioaf
“Windy”: Bloat is always a
problem during summer when
rain and hot sun stimulates the
growth of pasture or soft sappy
lucerne. It is a problem in
more ways than one. The
cows have to be closely
watched when they are feed-
ing. That means manpower
tied-up for an emergency that
may never happen. If a cow
blows, help has to be given at
once. Two bucket-fillers worth
£6O apiece may die in a matter
of minutes if assistance is not
at hand.
Bloat is caused by a break-
down in the cow’s belching-
mechanism. Whilst belching
at the table is an unpardonable
human sin, it is vitally neces-
sary for Pansy to get rid of
the surplus gas that forms
whilst she busily fills her
paunch. If she cannot belch,
gas builds up in the first and
second stomachs. If it cannot
escape, the cow will bloat.
Every dairyfarmer knows
how to handle bloat. What he
would like to know is how to
prevent it. Experiments with
various oils, such as peanut-
oil, sprayed on the pasture
have been tried, but this is still
beyond the reach of the small
farmer who may depend on a
paddock of lucerne along the
creek-flat to give him most of
his milking-feed. The old
methods of preventing bloat
seem to be the only ones that
can be relied on, although they
are not completely successful or
satisfactory.
If the cow has had some
fibrous food before she is
turned into the paddock of
lucerne or other green-feed,
she is less liable to blow. The
edge will be taken off her
appetite and she will be less
inclined to- gobble her food
hurriedly.
When the cows are turned
in to lush feed with an empty
stomach, they rush the food,
never taking time to lift their
heads and allow the ferment-
ing gas to escape. Thus,
pressure builds-up in the
stomachs and cannot escape.
Some dry matter in the cow’s
inside will take the edge off
her appetite. She will be more
inclined to eat “like a lady.”
The only trouble with this
method of prevention is that
there may be an acute shortage
of dry feed —even hay. Then
the only thing to do is to
watch the cows while they are
feeding.
Some farmers prefer to give
their cows several short spells
on the green-feed. This will
help overcome bloat the
intake of food at one time is
insufficient to cause the trouble
—but, it means a great deal
of interruption to farm-work.
Frosty and dew-wet green-
feed is inclined to cause bloat,
and one should never lose sight
of the fact that bloat can be
caused by choking. It is not
uncommon in apple- or potato-
growing districts to see a cow
blow. It is caused, in many
cases, by a lump of potato or
apple sticking in her throat.
This acts as a mechanical
barrier to the gas escaping.
Once the obstruction is
removed, provided the bloat
is not too severe, the cow will
get rid of the gas herself.
Once a sure and cheap cure
is found for bloat, dairymen
will breathe more freely. There
is always the worry when feed-
ing off lush feed that, while the
milk-cheque may greatly in-
crease, the herd may decrease
in direct ratio.
Queensland Fruit-fly
“Papaw”: Commenting on
the Queensland Fruit-fly, N. C.
Coleman, a Cairns naturalist,
notes that he had found up to
30 male fruit-flics on a
gardenia-blossom at night, but
no females. Following-up this
discovery, he also found con-
gregations of males round
passionfruit and granadilla-
tiowers.
His conclusion is that either
the males are fastidious in their
tastes and collect around heavy,
sweetly scented flowers, or that
these flowers emit an odor
similar to that of the female.
Local entomologists are
following this clue, which has
been brought to the attention
of the Department of Agricul-
ture and Stock. It is known
that the blowfly-population
has been reduced considerably
by releasing sterile males,
which mate in the usual way
but leave the female barren.
Perhaps a similar routine could
be followed with the fruit-fly.
Overlanding the
Modern Way
Over 19,000 head of cattle
have been “overlanded,” with-
out loss of condition, during
the last year in the remote, arid
areas of the N.T.
They have been moved in
two giant road-trains specially
built by Freighters, Limited,
for the William Angliss
organisation.
The two road-trains each
consist of three units —a prime-
mover with a unit and two
trailers, and each can carry 70
full-grown cattle or 140 heifers.
In these road-trains, cattle
arrive in fresh condition. The
road-trains run from Mary-
ville to Camooweal and Mount
Isa. Maryville is the William
Angliss base near Helen
Springs built specially for this
overlanding. The trips are 180
miles to Camooweal and
another 320 miles to Mount
Isa. Each road train makes
seven trips a fortnight.
Stocking-rates
“Billjim”: Studies at Rua-
kura (N.Z.) Research Station
confirmed that stocking-rate
has more influence than
grazing management on pro-
duction to the acre.
In comparison with rota-
tional paddock-grazing at
lower stock - concentrations,
strip-grazing gives the advan-
tage of slight restrictions in
food-intake and makes it easier
to appreciate when a small
surplus of grass becomes avail-
able for conservation.
The conclusions are applic-
able only to the use of pasture
The Bulletin, February 18, 1959
REPORT FROM CROHAMHURST
(5/2/’59)
In most of Queensland heavy rains and consequent
flooding are likely during March, although rainfall may
be patchy in the far south-west area. Serious flooding may
occur on the central and north coasts and central-west and
south-west districts. Good rains should continue in much
of the State during April.
Moderate rains are indicated on the coastal areas of
N.S.W. during March, with light to moderate patchy rains in
the remainder of the State. Moderate general rains are likely
in April, with heavier falls on the central and mid-north
coastal districts and Hunter River Valley. Rainfall may
become patchy during May.
Reasonably good rains are indicated in Victoria during
March, with heaviest falls in the central divisions. Rainfall
may be patchy during late autumn and winter, with well-
distributed rains in the second half of the year.
In South Australia, the central and south-east districts
and the Murray Valley should receive moderate rains in
March, although rainfall may be poor elsewhere. Light to
moderate patchy rains are likely in April, with reasonably
good rains starting in the agricultural areas during May.
The south-east and north-east areas of Western Aus-
tralia should receive good rains in March, although rainfall
may be patchy and below normal elsewhere. Apart from
moderate rains in the Kimberleys, rainfall may also be
poor during April.

during the spring, when there
is maximum grass-growth. At
other times of the year strip-
grazing may assume a greater
relative importance as a method
of rationing limited feed-
supplies.
Strip-grazing automatically
reduces intake by forcing
animals to eat the unpalatable
as well as the palatable grasses.
It also probably reduces feed-
requirements and appetite and
thus gives rise to small, more
frequent feed-surpluses.
When a surplus accumulates,
it is more easily recognised
when strip-grazing is used than
when each paddock is grazed
more laxly about every eight
days.
Victoria's
"Little Desert"
“Big Billy”; R. J. New-
man, Victorian Department of
Agriculture agrostologist, ad-
vises caution in developing 720
square-miles of the Little
Desert area of western Vic-
toria for pasture. The area in
question is close to the S.A.
border between Kaniva and
Dimboola.
Because of spectacular
success achieved in large areas
of heath-country just across the
border, there have been in-
sistent demands in Victoria
for expert investigation of the
potentialities of the Little
Desert.
Newman finds that certain
types of land in the area could
be developed by correcting
mineral deficiencies and apply-
ing dressings of super, and
potash fertilisers; but such
areas would be small, he says,
in proportion to the total,
Development mufl, in his
opinion, be based on the estab-
lishment of a leguminous
pasture, for which a reliable
and adequate winter-rainfall is
essential. An average rainfall
of less than 17in. on a poor
soil-structure would make the
establishment of such pasture
very doubtful,
The 30 years’ average rain-
fall in the area varies between
15in. and 16in. So he con-
siders that at present any land-
development should be con-
fined to soils carrying mallee-
broom, mallee-yacca and
mallee-heath, where retentive
clay subsoils are within about
3ft. of the surface.
Brown-rot
“Fencer”: The valuable
stone-fruit crop in Queens-
land’s granite-belt has been
seriously affected by brown-
rot, and many hundreds of
pounds’ worth of fruit has been
condemned in the Brisbane
markets.
Brown-rot, the most serious
disease affecting stone-fruit in
Australia and New Zealand, is
most difficult to control.
Peaches, plums and nectarines
are most commonly attacked,
but apricots, cherries and the
pome fruits may also be
affected. The disease attacks
every part of the trees and may
cause blossom-blight, death of
young twigs and even canker
of the older branches. As the
fruit nears maturity, or even
after picking, a small, brown,
soft spot appears on the skin
and quickly covers the whole
fruit, which will later shrink
and become hard and dry.
Affected fruit is often referred
to as a “mummy.”
Brown-rot is caused by a
fungous parasite (sclerotina
fructicola ) forming greyish-
brown masses of spores, which
appear on the surface of the
fruit spots and on shoots.
Spores also develop on old
“mummies” on the tree or on
the ground, where they pass
the winter and come to life
in the spring to carry-on the
infection.
To control the disease, cut
away dead twigs and any that
carry “mummies,” and burn
them, together with any
“mummies” lying on the
ground.
Spraying is not a great deal
of use, as sprays cannot be used
at the necessary strength with-
out injuring the trees. Bordeaux
mixture of a 6-4-40 strength,
or lime-sulphur at lgal. to
15gal. of water, sprayed at bud-
movement, will help to control
the blossom-blight stage of the
rot. Should the disease appear
at a later stage, lime-sulphur
at lgal. to 120 gal. of water,
colloidal-sulphur at the rate of
Hlb. to lOOgal. of water, or
wettable sulphur at 41b. to the
same amount of water, should
be used immediately, and, if
necessary, repeated every 10
days until a week before pick-
ing. This does not apply to
apricots, which would be
damaged by these sprays.
Care in picking and packing
the fruit is essential. The least
scratch or bruise may allow
spores to enter and cause the
rot. Fruit showing injury of
any kind should be burnt or
buried ; do the same with all
rotten fruit lying on the
ground. Never pick or pack
fruit when wet and be sure that
cleanliness is strictly observed
both in orchard and packing-
shed.
Graded Wheat
“Emel”: Overseas wheat-
buyers naturally want to be
sure of what they are getting
for their money. English
millers have learned to be
wary of mixed cargoes of Aus-
tralian wheat which, not quite
good enough for bread making,
are useless to cake- and biscuit-
manufacturers and can be used
only to make self-raising
flours.
Japan gets round the
problem by buying its hard, or
bread, wheats from north-
western New South Wales and
Queensland, where these strong
types grow best. Its require-
ments of soft wheat for
noodles and similar foods are
bought from Victoria, where,
especially in the Wimmera,
ideal varieties are produced for
these commodities and for
biscuit-making.
It is, of course, to the
advantage of Australian
biscuit - manufacturers, who
look to Victorian districts for
their supply of suitable flour,
that Victoria should continue
to grow soft wheats. Indeed,
their experts insist that to
introduce harder wheats, as
Wimmera farmers have been
repeatedly advised to do,
would only produce a blend,
even if these would grow well
there. That blend might
perhaps improve the quality of
the local bread, but would be
unsuitable for overseas markets
and utterly useless to Aus-
tralian biscuit-makers. The
only way then to profit by
this much-advocated growing
of harder wheats in tradi-
tionally soft-wheat areas is to
grade the varieties before
marketing.
Argentina and Canada,
which do grade their w'heat,
are beating Australia in com-
petition for world markets.
For two successive seasons now
South Australia has proved
that grading wheat pays well.
The other States must grade
theirs or they may lose even
those markets their mixed
cargoes now find.

system of voting is used in Senate
elections ?
(1) Until 1949 the Senate con-
sisted of six members from each
of the six States. In 1949 the House
of Representatives was enlarged to
123, and the Senate membership
was increased to 60 —10 from each
State. (2) The system of voting
for Senate candidates was also
changed in 1949—from the preferen-
tial system (which ensured that the
party which polled the most in any
State had all its candidates elected
—and which resulted in the farcical
situation between 1946 and 1949 of
the non-Labor parties having only
three members in a House of 36)
to the proportional-representation
system. In practice the p.-r. system
(with five vacancies to be filled from
each State) results in the party
which gains the most votes winning
three places and the party with the
next-biggest poll winning two.

Recipe for home-made wine ?
Home-made wines must not con-
tain more than two per cent,
alcohol, and must not be offered
for sale. Before starting, assemble
the necessary vats, tubs, etc.,
Gather the fruit when ripe, in dry
weather, remove blemishes and
stalks, put it in an enamel or
wooden tub and bruise thoroughly
with a wooden masher. Cover the
pulp with boiling water, place a
cloth over the tub and let stand
for from one to three weeks. Strain-
off the liquor and measure it; to
every gallon allow 31b. sugar. Place
in a tub or cask, stir well, and let
ferment with the bung out. Fer-
menting should subside in about 10
days, after which should be added
loz. isinglass and raisins to
every 9gals. If evaporation has
reduced the quantity noticeably, add
a little water. Close the cask and
leave for about six months, when it
may be bottled.
Brief Answers
J.C. (N.Z.): The man who sold
you the tickets is quite right; no

There is no provision in the Act
for seeking share-capital from the
public, nor for the publication of
accounts. (2) In the title, “Pty.”

Large bowls of multicolored flowers
were set at the chancel-steps of St. Mark’s
Church, Darling Point, where Mrs. Mar-
garet (Mabs) Pugliese was married to
Albert Bryk on Saturday. Given away by
her brother Frank, Mabs wore an
ensemble of champagne-tinted silk-
organza and French lace. Cut on straight
sheath-lines, the frock was mounted on
parchment satin. The full, straight coat
was of finely-pleated organza and was
topped with a large powder-puff toque
of matching marabou-feathers; the
bouquet was of deep-cream slipper-
orchids. Mrs. Frank Grills, her matron-
of-honor, wore an Empire-line frock of
cream satin.
Later Miss Ann McGuirk, the bride’s
sister, received 150 guests at her Vaucluse
home. Among those who came from
Melbourne for the wedding were Mr.
and Mrs. W. K. Burnside, Mr. and Mrs.
Jack Wagstaff, Mrs. Margaret Saker,
Mrs. Jean Davies, Mr. and Mrs. Ernest
Haisman, Mr. Dorothy Gitsham, Mr. and
Mrs. Cyril Carter and Mr. Norman Watt.
Other guests included Lady Braddon,
Professor and Mrs. Harry Messel, Mr.
and Mrs. Desmond Tester, Mrs. Max
Murray (authoress Maysie Greig), Mr.
and Mrs. S. Cox (with their daughter
Betty), Mr. and Mrs. Goldfinch (interior-
decorator Nora Macdougall) and Dr. and
Mrs. Monty Gildea.

“The old order changeth”! One of the
questions in the written exam, for the
Australia’s Homemaker of the Future
Award, begins: “After marriage both
of you will continue to work .. . (and
goes on to ask for suitable menus in
the circumstances). How different from
the homemaker of the past, who left
work to set-up house! Yet this is a true
picture of modern conditions, especially
as the young lady in the exam.-paper
has a fiance earning £970 per year, owning
a block of land and having to build a
house of not less than 1000 square feet.
The natural solution is for both partners
to work, for a while at least, though
whether it is a happy solution is
debatable.
☆ ☆ ☆
Forty-six girls throughout N.S.W. sat
for the Homemaker of the Future exam,
during the week (twice as many from the
country as from the metropolitan area);
the winner will be flown to Melbourne
later this month to compete with other
State finalists in the national final.
Tessa Hughes is a young English
schoolteacher who has been living in
Australia for the past four years and
whose special interest is the theatre. She
is to play the part of Mary Magdalene
in the production of “Mary Magdala"
at the Genesian Theatre, opening on
February 20. The play, by Ernest Milton,
centres round the effect that the
events of the first Good Friday have
upon the friends of Mary Magdalene. A
special feature of the play is the music,
a Jewish lament and tumbler-music
played on the recorder. Photo by Child

That the poet’s own voice has a special
magic is the belief of Mrs. Hazel de
Berg, who has set herself the task of
making a record of the voices of Aus-
tralia’s outstanding poets of today. And
certainly, to hear the familiar words of
“My Country” in the rich, resonant voice
of Dorothea Mackellar herself is to
experience a fresh and exciting reaction
to the poem. So, too, the voice of Dame
Mary Gilmore as she reads “Nationality”
brings the poem home to the listener as
no printed page could.
Mrs. de Berg has already on her tape-
recorder readings by 20 poets, including
Douglas Stewart, David Campbell,
Harley Matthews, James McAulay, Vin-
cent Buckley, Judith Wright and John
Thompson. Both the A.B.C. and the
Education Department are interested in
her work, and she is determined to make
a complete record of our poets today.
Mrs. de Berg has borne all the expense
of the work herself, not only for equip-
ment but also for her travels as far
afield as Melbourne, Brisbane and
Adelaide to interview poets ; but she feels
that the value of the work she is doing
far outweighs any trouble it may entail.
In this belief she was much encouraged
by the taxi-driver who brought her, with
her “ton-weight” equipment, to The
Bulletin. After she had told him, rather
defensively, that she was making record-
ings of poetry he became most enthusias-
tic about the idea, quoted Paterson,
Lawson and C. J. Dennis all the way in
from Dulwich Hill, carried the tape-
recorder into the building for her and
refused to take any payment for the trip.
“That’s on me, lady,” he said. “And
good luck to you!”

The complaint of Commonwealth
Government stenographers in Brisbane
that the most competent workers were
by-passed for more glamorous types
brings to mind the businessman who
asked the business-college to send him “a
good typist, the plainest and dowdiest
you’ve got.” He added that he had “a
lot of young chaps in his office and he
wanted to get some work out of them!”
It is to be hoped that the business-college
principal didn’t tell the poor girl just
what qualifications were called for.

Friday the 13th was the inspiration for
the party which the Guys and Dolls
Committee, which works for the Crppled
Children’s Society, held on that date in
the rooms of the Royal Commonwealth
Society. “Beat the Devil,” they called it,
and decorated the rooms with modernistic
posters on the motif, together with
colorful posters from the film “Guys and
Dolls.” To judge by the number of gay
and youthful supporters who turned-up
to the party, the devil was successfully
put to rout and the spirit of cheerful-
ness was victorious.

People who complain that TV has
made it 100 per cent, harder to keep the
children to their homework often remind
themselves that there has always been
something to distract the young from
their books. The other day a youthful
father brought this argument in to per-
suade his small son that he should finish
his homework before he began to watch
TV. “When Mummie and I were young,”
he said, “we were never allowed to listen
to the radio before we did our sums.”
The reaction was not encouraging.


“Huh! ” said the son, “What’s so wonder-
ful about the old radio? I should think
you wouldn’t care one way or the other!”

At a- State Government reception in
Queen’s Hall, Parliament House, the
Premier formally launched the contest
organised to raise about £150,000 to send
an Australian team to the Olympic
Games in Rome next year. The guests,
mostly mayors and shire-presidents from
all parts of Victoria, have been asked
to form committees to select a girl from
their district as their representative. The
winner of the Miss Olympics contest will
be the lass representing the district which,
on a proportional basis raises the most
money for the fund. Her prize will be
a trip to Rome with a chaperone and
tickets for all events at the Games.
Mrs. Bolte was smart in a brown silk

Five-hundred hampers containing 21
food products have been made available
by the food and allied trades to the
Yooralla Crippled Children’s Appeal;
they'll be given to the first 500 hostesses
who arrange parties to assist the appeal.
Hampers may be obtained by contacting
the appeal office, 59 Pelham Street, Carl-
ton, or by phoning FJ 4579 or FJ 6246.
If every woman in every suburb or coun-
try town would participate in Campaign
Hostess and give a party, great or small,
the Yooralla appeal would soon reach
the month’s target-figure of £lO,OOO. This
is the chance for women to rally round
an appeal which helps children all over
the State.
The Bishop of Geelong, the Rt. Rev.
J. McKie, with Rev. T. G. Gee assisting,
officiated at the marriage at St. John’s,
Toorak, of Pamela Rowena, elder
daughter of Mr. and Mrs. E. L. Hayne,
of Toorak, with Robert, twin son of
Mr. and Mrs. Robert Weir, also of
Toorak. The bride’s full-length gown of
white re-embroidered French lace had
a scoop - neckline, long, tight - fitting
sleeves, with the slim, graceful skirt
carrying long, full train. A bow of tulle
and orange-blossom held the long tulle
veil, and she carried a bouquet of lilies.
Margaret Wallace, Susan Strachan, Anne
Coope and Patricia Mackinnon were
bridesmaids. Their bell-skirted frocks
were of silver-green taffeta ; they carried
bouquets of roses and tuberoses, and in
their hair were half-circlets of tuberoses.
Junior bridesmaids were the bride’s sister
Susan and her cousins Felicity Hayne
and Diana Crowther. They were dressed
in full-length, full-skirted frocks of white
silk-taffeta trimmed with sashes of silver-
green taffeta and headdresses of
tuberoses, and carried small white baskets
filled with white roses and tuberoses.
Douglas Weir was best man, and grooms-
men were John Richardson, Charles
Hayne and Philip Aitken. Reception was
at the home of the bride’s parents.
Having completed her schooldays at
Lauriston, Barbara, second daughter of
Mr. and Mrs. Charles Lane, of Toorak,
is now at the Melbourne Technical
College doing a business course. She is
a well-known member of the younger

sailing and tennis. On Friday next (Feb.
20) Barbara and her friend, Carolyn
Best, will be guests-of-honor at a dance
which their parents are combining to
give at Mr. and Mrs. Lane’s home.
A most attractive and colorful arrange-
ment of pineapples, plums, peaches and
grapes decorated the buffet dinner-table
when Sir John and Lady Teasdale enter-
tained more than 100 guests in their home,
at which the guest-of-honor was Mr. K.
Alvappillia, permanent secretary of the
Ministry of Agriculture and Food in
Ceylon. The hostess chose a frock of
cinnamon-brown Chantilly-lace, the skirt
falling in soft pleats, the bodice featuring
a deep shawl-collar. Her daughter Jane
wore a full-skirted frock of dark-green
silk-tatfeta. Among the guests were Sir

see. Its kind is “Brighton Rock”:
dead-end kids.
Francis is a small Tasmanian boy
who believes that power-poles are
some kind of fabulous monsters called
“Soons.” He has odd dreams, which
he half-believes are real, and he has
a gang of heroic imaginary friends
called “The Lads.”
As he grows older, a lonely boy,
mutinous or indifferent at school, he
is more and more tempted to find the
living counterparts of “The Lads”
among his wilder schoolmates, and
increasingly he is haunted by the idea
of the heroic and splendid life to be
found across the water in Melbourne:
“The vast fact of the mainland sang
in his head.”
After first love fails him —Chris-
topher Koch describes very well
indeed the callousness of the girls who
dump us in our youth —Francis takes
wing for Melbourne; and there, with
some of his wild friends from Tas-
mania, he falls among bodgies and
widgies or some-such; and they bodge
and they widge—with a little shop-
lifting, a few minor burglaries, some
intense widgie lovemaking and a good
deal of drinking and being sick in the
gutter —until at last there is the inevit-
able car-smash and, a sadder and a
wiser man, Francis comes back to
Tasmania, presumably to start life
anew.
It is, as one says, a good novel in
this vein. Francis, as so often with the
central figure of a novel, is not very
clear as a character. It is not easy to
reconcile the dreamy, poetic boy with
the young tough he presumably must
have become to knock-around with
the bodgies. He seems to feel disil-
lusioned with Melbourne much too
soon—the glamor of the big city can
persist for a long while in youth. But
still, as a symbol of Tasmanian youth,
if not quite as a person, he “works.”
There is one excellent widgie, very
hard and fierce; and the general picture
of youth on the spree, besides being
worked out with plenty of lively inci-
dents, has that additional local
interest one would expect when the
novel is set in Melbourne.
But the vein is not, all the same,
one that Christopher Koch would be
wise to persist in. Despite contempor-
ary fashion, this reviewer clings to a
notion that a good novel is essentially
an interesting tale; something that, if
you invited a friend to dinner you
would be interested —or rather, fas-
cinated —to hear him relate; and
neither the sensitive adolescent nor
the behavior of bodgies—unless some-
thing really bizarre should happen —
is as interesting as all that. Who really
wants to hear about pimply youths
being sick in the gutter?
But that is by no means Christopher
Koch’s only claim to attention. The
most stimulating thing about “The
Boys in the Island” is that parts of
it —some of the Tasmanian parts —do
make a genuinely interesting tale.
In a light way. one of these
parts is the chapter where a gang
of 16-year-old schoolboys sneak into
a. pub for their first beer and
are amusingly chiacked by the
wharfies: this is good comedy, and
comedy is always interesting. In
a more serious mood, there is the Tas-
manian love-affair and the picture of
the girl’s family —the father who lurks
all day in his workshop, emerging only
at rare intervals to bully them or, in
moments of amiability, to beat his wife
with his belt; the dotty old aunt who
follows the lovers all over the country-
side (very sensitively described) when
they want to be alone; the utter and
devastating naturalness of the girl
when she dumps poor Francis. These
make genuinely curious and dramatic
scenes, and one wishes there were
more of them.
At Geelong Grammar
Their Succeeding Race, by Michael
Persse (Cheshire) is the reflection of a
tremendous day they had at Geelong
Grammar in November, 1957, when,
to celebrate the school’s centenary,
they staged this pageant-play ranging
from the creation of the world —at least
the choir sings Haydn’s “Creation” in
the chapel—right through to the
natural conclusion of the centenary.
The chapel lawn was the principal
setting for the play; but, with sailors
appearing on top of the cloisters like
the ghost on the battlements of
Elsinore, descendants of pioneers
arriving down the road in a Jaguar,
convicts, bullocks and stockmen
manoeuvring about the playing-fields
and a rowing-party floating in over dry
land to the Willows and resting their
oars vertically against the cloisters, the
pageant ranged almost as far in space
as it did in time. Every boy in the
school, except some unfortunate souls
who live in outlying colleges, took part
in it; and even these—perhaps one
should call them fortunate —had the
privilege of watching it.
Necessarily, in the vast historical
sweep of the pageant, a few signifi-
cant events had to be omitted, such as
Canute commanding the tide to retreat
or the birth of Mr. E. J. Ward; but it
is amazing how much they managed
to cram into it.
Shortly before the creation of the
world three schoolboys Capper,
Mackinnon and Macarthur-Onslow —
are discovered talking to the ghost of
a former headmaster, Dr. Brown,
equally unperturbed by their some-
what premature appearance on earth,
and—when meeting even a living
headmaster is bad enough—the ghost.
This is a prologue, and at the conclu-
sion of it Michael Persse rises to some
of the best of his verse;—
We have seen unfinished things
wrought here,
Things wrought out in the manner
of a play
In which to act’s to see, to see’s to
act;
In which Australia, playing a leading
part
Beyond the edged economy of man
in God’s,
Finds all the world her stage and
heaven too:
A part in which the lusty stars now
guard
Not sleep but lusty wakefulness:
A sense of destiny and things astir.
From then on things are astir with
a vengeance. A thief, escorted by
soldiers and encouraged by two Gin-
drinkers, is hanged at Tyburn (behind
the cloisters). Mr. Pitt, Lord Sydney
and Sir Joseph Banks meet George 111
at Windsor Castle. Sailors are
observed furling the sails and singing
“Shenandoah” on the deck of Phillip’s
flagship between Rio and the Cape,
1787.
We are approaching Sydney Cove; and
soon enough, to the accompaniment
of an eloquent meditation by Phillip
and the removal of such props as logs,
tubs, a loom, rushes, etc., by convicts
under the supervision of marines, we
get there. It seems a little unfair —
though ingenious—that we get through
the next few years of Australian his-
tory by having a history-lesson; but
soon we are in a Western District home
in 1852, singing an old bush song and
rounding-up the Irishman who is
supposed to be rounding-up the sheep;
and the squatter, bringing us right to
the meat of the pageant, needs a school
for his boys: —
Gertrude :
Van Diemen’s Land has boarding-
schools I’ve heard.
Gwendoline :
The Scotch have started one in
Melbourne now.
The 1852 Wife:
Why can’t we have a Church of
England 0ne?....
So to the founding of the school with
the support (and the attendance) of
the Bishop of Melbourne; the deplor-
able closing of the school by its credi-
tors, when a butcher sued the Bishop
for the meat the school had eaten; and
the triumphant reopening; and a very
nice song about rowing and resting at
the Willows; and some improving
moments in the study of John Brace-
bridge Wilson, headmaster in 1891; and

Reviewed Briefly
Your Book of Ballet: Pigeon Crowle
(Faber). A clear and unaffected intro-
duction to ballet, pleasantly presented
and well illustrated. It can be recom-
mended as a gift for any little girl
interested in dancing and can be read
without boredom by her parents.
* * * *
Blake’s Reach: Catherine Gaskin
(Collins). Once again Miss Gaskin by
her gift of storytelling transcends the
triteness of her material. Here we have
the oft-told tale of 18th century
smuggling on the Romney Marsh, the
belles and beaux and red-headed Irish
beauties, the echoes of the French
Revolution, the faithful servants, the
run-down aristocratic mansion. The
love-interest is superficial and the situa-
tions improbable, yet there is a force-
ful competence about the way in which
the story is told that makes it good
entertainment and a potential best-
seller.
* * * *
Acting f?ir You: John Gunn and
Barbara Bingham (Lutterworth). John
Gunn founded Sydney’s Shavian Play-
house in 1951, and that year married
Barbara Bingham of Queensland, who
had been studying at Sydney University
and playing “St. Joan.” They moved
on to England, and this book is the
result of their researches there, a most
practical little book, with speech-
exercises and physical exercises for
actors, a chapter on putting on plays,
and chapters on drama - societies,
drama-schools (“Laurence Olivier,
Peggy Ashcroft, Ann Todd, Charles
Laughton, Margaret Lockwood,
Pamela Brown, Ronald Simpson, Sybil
Thorndike, Valerie Hobson and Kay
Hammond started their careers in
drama-schools”), repertory and, last
but not least, “Getting a Job.” Very
few books on the stage treat the sub-
ject so objectively; most are on what it
should be, not what it is. With 15
plates.
* $ * *
The Royal Ballet: John Hart
(Faber). The 214 illustrations in this
somewhat handsome volume are photo-
graphs taken during performances at
Covent Garden Opera House, for
Hart says that a dancer gives a real
performance only on. a stage. Else-
where there must be a certain amount
of posing and false staging. He takes
11 famous ballets and describes them
in a series of pictures accompanied
by some uninspired captions. Also
included are photographs of the
choreographers, and mundane bio-
graphical sketches about them. The
book has not the magic of ballet but it
provides a useful record of these 11
particular ballets and a reference to
the personalities associated with the
Royal Ballet.
* * * *
Stacy: by Roberta Leigh (Heine-
mann). A clever picture of a hard-
boiled publicity-woman, who is so
perfectly adjusted to intrigue and
manoeuvre that she cannot recognise
her own falsify. The tactics of the
business and advertising world are
fascinating to observe and the un-
principled heroine remains charming.
* * * *
The Darling of Her Heart: Rhys
Davies (Heinemann). Short - stories,
wry, humorous and tragic of Welsh
mining-people. They are concerned
more with mood, character and atmo-
sphere than with formal plot and are
written with the assurance of an
accomplished story-teller.
•i* *i' •}•
Jephthah and His Daughter: Lion
Feuchtwanger (Hutchinson). The epi-
logue describes the Book of Judges as
“a tangle of confusions and contradic-
tions” and says that the verses about
Jephthah were written centuries later
by authors who “misunderstood their
material” and imposed their own very
different religious views on it. Arche-
ologists have since discovered much
about Jephthah’s age, and Feucht-
wanger uses this knowledge to recon-
struct Jephthah’s story yet again, seeing
him as a symbol both of his own time
and of heroic man in every age of
swiftly changing beliefs. Man’s notions
about God are the chief theme, and it
is seen most intensely in an interpre-
tation of Jephthah’s bargain with his
God which committed him to the
sacrifice of his daughter. The back-
ground of shifting social patterns
is interestingly handled, but the people
are made more rational than one
imagines them to have been, and the
total effect is somewhat dry.

ENEBGOL kept me in I
says Stirling Moss
Stirling Moss’s amazing win in the 32-lap
Melbourne Grand Prix on 30th November made
newspaper headlines all over Australia.
In Moss’s own words, this is what happened.
‘After less than 6 laps, the water temperature
gauge showed me there was practically no water
left in the radiator. Even so, the engine went
all right until about 15 miles from the finish
when the oil temperature went right off the gauge.
I slowed up hoping it would last the distance.’
The vital part played by the engine oil in keeping
Stirling Moss’s Cooper FI running for over
80 miles of this 100 mile race at an average
speed of over 100 m.p.h. illustrates the excep-
tional properties of BP Energol Motor Oil.
Whatever make of car or truck you drive, you
can depend on BP Energol for efficient lubric-
ation and protection for all moving parts.
