EARLY PASTERNAK
The huge success of “Doctor
Zhivago” seems to have set English
publishers digging for bandwagon
pieces of early Pasternak. Apparently
not much is available: of the three
volumes under different imprints that
have so far reached Sydney bookshops,
two contain much the same material
(though in different translations), and
the other, though it looks like a novel,
is really only a long short-story.
Prose and Poems, a handsome
paperback by Benn, contains “Safe
Conduct” (an early autobiographical
sketch), four stories and an array of
short poems —all written before 1933.
The autobiography and three of the
stories make very difficult reading.
They are done in a prose that is always
reaching out towards other forms:
poetry, music, the philosophical essay.
They have an almost indigestible rich-
ness of imagery, and the narrative
approach is oblique and allusive to
the point of sometimes complete
obscurity.
The obscurity seems to spring from
a robust and uncompromising search
for the expression that will convey
reality on every possible level.
Apparently drunk with the power of
the senses and the working of Nature
on the senses, the young Pasternak
mounts image upon fresh and striking
image in a way that makes some of the
West European experimental writers of
the period seem models of simplicity.
In “Safe Conduct” this approach,
lacking control and direction, produces
a portrait of Pasternak’s youthful
temperament rather than of his life —
a temperament by which all else is
reflected. In three of the stories —one
about a love-affair involving the poet
Heine in Italy; one about a commissar
in the Revolution who unwittingly
condemns his own son to death; the
other a set of “Letters From Tula,”
which are said to have something to
do with Tolstoy’s death at Astapovo
—it is again out of control, creating in
the reader the feeling of having been
driven by night through a foreign city.
One is filled with haunting impres-
sions, but quite unable to grasp the
outlines and the guiding design. All
three should have been poems. Prose
cannot carry Pasternak’s passionate
conception of their themes. But in
the remaining story, “The Childhood
of Luvers,” the images are chosen and
ordered with restraint, and the result
is a masterpiece of its kind —a gradual
and tender revelation of a girl’s first
experiences of adult life.
In translating the poems J. M. Cohen
has ignored Pasternak’s Russian metres
as unsuited to English, and, almost
dispensing with rhyme, has tried for a
faithful rendering of the original
images. One would be surprised if he
hasn’t caught them all: at any rate he
has set the poems out in schemes that
allow most of them to stand pretty
firmly on their new English legs.
The short novel, The Last Summer
(Peter Owen), though clearer than the
three earlier stories, is neither as clear
nor as effective as “Luvers.” The
hero, resting after a long train journey
to visit his sister in a remote province
in the winter of 1916, dreamily recalls
a romantic experience he had in the
summer of 1914, evoking a way of
life that died in the Great War. It
sounds some haunting chords of
nostalgia and in some ways demon-
strates Pasternak’s later sense of
history, but, read at this distance from
its time and place, it lacks definite
direction and point.
The chief value of both these books,
apart from showing us where
“Zhivago” came from, is that they
hint at the existence of a body of
Russian writing very different from
what, through propaganda transla-
tions of one sort or another, we have
come to regard as post-Revolutionary
Russian literature. Here is one
Russian who has remained devoted to
literature as art, who has steadily
refused to accept his society’s defini-
tion of itself and has gone on making
his own. Surely there are others? Will
these books open the way for transla-
tions of them?
J. A.
A Play by Schiller
Stephen Spender’s translation of
Schiller’s Mary Stuart (Faber) Is so
remote from the original that the
reader, at first glance, cannot but be
disappointed in it.
Peter Wood, who produced it for
the Old Vic, admits that in many
places, especially in Schiller’s approval
of Mary and his disapproval of Eliza-
beth, he has made the playwright say
the opposite of what he wished to; and
Spender, claiming that with Schiller’s
operatic style the translator is free to
“pare, compress, touch-up, vary and
elucidate,” admits that his version
should not be described as a transla-
tion so much as “a streamlined
adaptation.”
But, apart from the fact that the
version has its own interest as a plain,
workmanlike piece of versification by
Spender, the point is that, however
much variation and touching-up may
have gone on, it is still possible in such
an adaptation to give the essentials of
Schiller’s play; or at least the one great
scene which is of peculiar interest and
poignance to English audiences and
readers. Schiller’s great device was to
bring about an entirely mythical meet-
ing between Mary and Elizabeth at
Fotheringay, just at the point when
Mary has been sentenced to death by
her judges, while Elizabeth is still
hesitating to sign the warrant for her
execution. It is something that ought
to have happened in history, but didn’t;
and it is fascinating to see it happen.
Spender, in his introduction, seems
to this reviewer to take quite the wrong
view of the question of accuracy in a
historical drama. He says, “if poeti-
cised or fictionised history has to be
accurate there seems no point in
attempting it.” But why should there
be no point in historical truth?
Surely accuracy is the vital point in
the historical drama: that it should
reveal the truth, thereby establishing
an authentic national mythology: and,
in fact, if too many glaring and obvious
falsehoods are displayed, as happens
from time to time in Schiller’s play, the
audience’s belief in the drama will be
shattered. But the playwright’s excuse
for tampering with history is that
sometimes the inward and essential
truth of an event can more effectively
be conveyed by altering inconvenient
facts; and that is exactly the case here.
Schiller, at any rate in this version,
is not impressive in the childish motive
he appears to give Elizabeth for agree-
ing to see Mary, that she wants to find
out who is really the better-looking of
the two; he is inconclusive in his

FROM EGYPT TO JAVA
YS/'HILE Australia is an oasis of calm
* * in the international political world,
preoccupied with the doings of models
and jockeys, southern Asia and much
of the north-east is oppressed and held
down by dictatorship.
The whole of the area is learning
the unwisdom of playing with Com-
munism. Except for Japan and the
Philippines, there is no area from the
Elbe in Western Europe to the Pacific
Ocean which is not wrestling with the
Red blight.
China is facing famine, and has dis-
covered that fine words are not very
nourishing. Indo-China has been
partly swallowed, and is rumbling with
the indigestion caused by infiltration
in other parts, as in Laos. Burma
wishes it had never seen a Communist.
Like India, it looks northward at a
lowering Red cloud over the Hima-
layas, the nature of which was vividly
painted by the Dalai Lama the other
day in his first press conference. Siam
has just executed the Communist
leader of a plan to “overthrow the
kingdom and the Buddhist religion.”
The Dalai Lama made no bones
about what Communism has been doing
in Tibet and about the futility of trying
to compromise with it. The result, in
Tibet’s case, of applying Buddhist
principles to dealings with the con-
querors, was merely to produce cynical
disregard of agreements, use of the
names of those who compromised,
forgery of signatures and an accelera-
tion of the movement to wipe-out the
Tibetan civilisation and race, and
replace it with immigrant Com-
munised Chinese.
India is ill with the cancer of Kerala,
where, oddly enough, the trade-
unions are taking the leading part in
the movement to force the Communist
Government, which they were so eager
to induct, out of office.
Ceylon is afflicted with a plague of
Communists and “Trotskyites” who
make a dictatorship inevitable. Its
Leftist Prime Minister, who used to
go starry-eyed whenever he turned his
face towards Moscow, has been forced
to use troops to deal with dock-strikers
in Colombo, and ugly and furtive
compromises to keep himself in office.
VX/ITH Pakistan continually fighting-
off the pressure from across the
Afghan border, Kassem in Iraq is find-
ing it very difficult to keep his regime
for himself. It seems definite now that
he has realised his mistake in going to
bed with the Kremlin.
The Egyptian official press is accus-
ing him of having formed a Com-
munist alliance to break the back of
Nasserism as a preliminary to breaking
the back of the Communist movement
in the interests of British imperialism.
Having granted amnesty to the
“bloody imperialist agents” in jail, he
now has his forces standing to arms to
ward-off possible attack from two
directions the insurrectionary ele-
ments supporting Nasser, with whom
he is trying to compromise, and the
Communists who have armed him.
The only people not menacing him
seem to be the “diabolical agents of
British imperialism.”
Nasser is holding “elections” to
induct a one-party regime modelled
on the Russian Communist system of
Government, with general suppression
of free opinion, while at the same time
taking what the Russians are prepared
to offer in the way of gifts and bribes.
It was reported in Egypt a few days
ago that the Russians were likely to
get the contracts for the whole of the
Aswan Dam project in all its stages
at a price at which the builders would
most certainly lose a large amount of
money. They would just as certainly
gain a firm propaganda foothold in
Africa from which it would be almost
impossible to prise them.
ALTOGETHER, with Nasser
stirring-up rebellion in the Sudan,
where two Ministers have been cited for
court-martial, and continued sporadic
war against Palestine, the situation
continues eruptive all the way from the
Formosa Strait to the Elbe, but
nowhere so much as in Indonesia, just
over the horizon from northern Aus-
tralia, where more than half the people
refuse to acknowledge the Govern-
ment and the Government refuses to
acknowledge the Constitution.
On June 23, typical of the manner
in which the affairs of Indonesia are
carried on, it was admitted that an
intelligence-officer had been sent to its
Commander-in-Chief (Soekarno) in
Cambodia, which he was visiting after
his return from Hollywood, to inform
him of events, but it was denied that
the emissary carried a demand for the
establishment of complete military
Government.
On the same day General Sir
Richard Hull, the British C.-in-C.
Land Forces in the Far East, landed
in Djakarta at the invitation of General
Nasution, who appears to be the real
dictator of Indonesia, to have a
“closer look at the progress made by
the Indonesian Army.”
Soekarno returned on June 29 at a
time when the existing Parliament had
died for lack of a quorum, when the
Army had frozen all political activity,
and when the Constituent Assembly
had refused to endorse their Wander-
ing Boy’s proposals for a new dictator-
ship.
The Army has clamped-down on
public opinion, and particularly on the
reporting of details of the ruler’s more
“frivolous activities,” such as the
kissing of movie-actresses, during his
external junketings. It has also
clamped-down on news of the fighting
in the Celebes, where the authorities
are getting rather the worst of it in
their contests with almost universal
rebellion outside the coastal cities.
Equally it is imposing silence about
the state of armed neutrality in
Sumatra.
CjOEKARNO, on arrival in Djakarta,
immediately promised that he would
“not establish a dictatorship” but that
he would “act on the firm will of the
majority of the people” in regard to
the reinstitution of the Constitution of
1945.
This priceless bit of double-talk was
followed by the dissolution of the
Constituent Assembly and the re-
inauguration of the 1945 Constitution,
which makes Soekarno, as Premier
as well as President, a dictator, if
he is strong enough to dictate. It gives
the green-light to Communist agitation
and reduces the political struggle to one
between the Moscow emissaries and the
military—the power of the Red-
dominated trade-unions versus that of
the Army —with the various half-
dozen rebel movements in and out of
Java turning the whole business into a
several-cornered fight. Everybody
seems willing to let Soekarno ride the
crest of the wave and enjoy life, being
all things to all men.
Meanwhile a campaign is being
carried on against the Australian
administration of New Guinea and
promoting the idea of annexation of
West New Guinea in order to divert the
minds of the restive, fast-breeding
Indonesians who are not able to hire
expensive American luxury-aircraft or
to go abroad to kiss movie-actresses.


"HOWDY, STRANGER?"


PLAIN ENGLISH
Strikes and Communism
Disturbances on the wharves arising
from the Italian shipping-strike support
the belief that such outbursts are only
a pretext for a world-wide series of
strikes organised by the international
transport-unions under the aegis of the
Communist-run W.F.T.U.
There have been too many of these
outbreaks round the world since the
Tokyo conference to which Mr. Jim
Healy of the Watersiders went recently
as an enthusiastic delegate. All of them
have had something to do with transport,
if not always with shipping.
There was a transport strike organised
in Spain, though this was hurriedly
abandoned. The record includes light-
ning strikes in Colombo, which led
the Government there to turning-out the
military—and it is a Leftist Govern-
ment ; in Nigerian ports, where “racial
discrimination” has been alleged ; in
some Italian ships ; of boilermakers at
Barrow-in-Furness (U.K.) among those
engaged on the new Windsor Castle —
this was a “demarcation” dispute as to
which union should have the privilege of
putting chalk-marks on plates.
There have been a few others ; and,
of course, it is nothing new for the Aus-
tralian wharflaborers to be on strike —
they seem to be a law to themselves.
Time and again wharflaborers and
others strike to protest against court
decisions or contemplated action and,
when they face the court, apologise and
give assurances which prove valid only
until next time.
Millions a year are lost to trade and
employment by this sort of manoeuvre,
which is almost invariably the emanation
of a union led by or honeycombed with
active Communist officials. Yet Govern-
ments sit supine and nobody seems able
or willing to make a move to put a
check on something that is obviously
done not for the benefit of Australian
workers, but to tighten the Communist
grip on transport, which is one of the
primary needs of defence, and to weaken
shipping- and transport-owners quite
clearly in the interests of world-
Communism.
The A.CT.U. appears to have fallen
under the influence of the Communists.
The essential point about the current
wharf disturbances is that they are not
produced by any request from' Italian
seamen in general but only by a small
section. The ships which are causing the
trouble here are manned by Italian sea-
men who, like most of their fellow-
nationals engaged in the maritime indus-
tries, are not on strike.
What is happening is that the Com-
munist leaders of the W.W.F. and their
captive Mr. A. E. Monk and his
lieutenants in the A.C.T.U. are trying to
force these foreign workers against their
inclination to join in a Communist-
organised strike the issues in which
Australians have no concern.
It seems time to inquire whether the
A.C.T.U. and the W.W.F. have taken
over the country. In Tasmania the
attempt of the W.W.F. to enforce an
illegal levy against the Hurseys was a
negation of every principle of democracy
and a complete flouting of the law; and
it went without penalty.
Report to the Nation
[From Canberra]
Prime Minister Menzies gave a report-
to-the-nation following his 10-weeks’
world-tour in which he met 10 heads-of-
Governments.
His most immediately interesting con-
tact was with the new leader in Singa-
pore, Lee Kuan Yew, whose dealings
with the Communists have disturbed
Western observers.
It was to clear his mind on this
question that Menzies decided to call at
Singapore on his way home. He re-
ported :
“The new Lee Government is a very
young Administration —the average age
being 37y, while Mr. Lee, himself, is
only 36.
“Mr. Lee, who has tremendous prob-
lems, does not lean towards Communists.
To the contrary, he regards them as one
of his most urgent problems.
“I have been informed most reliably
that the new Government is incorruptible
and is capable of doing a good, honest
job.
“Australia can look at the new Singa-
pore Government in a friendly way. We
have no reason to fear it, but every reason
to encourage it,” said Mr. Menzies.
Another result of Mr. Menzies’s tour
was a forthright assurance from the new
Netherlands Prime Minister, Mr. de
Quay, that there wxmld be no change in
Dutch policy on the question of West
New Guinea.
Mr. de Quay assured Menzies that his
Government would carry out the same
policy of “hands-off Dutch New Guinea”
towards Indonesia as had been espoused
by his predecessor.
For his part, Menzies informed de
Quay that the Australian policy,
enunciated during the visit of Indonesian
Foreign Minister -Subandrio, still stood.
Mr. Menzies said he found that
Chancellor Adenauer wrongly believed
there was strong anti-German feeling in
both the British Government and British
people themselves, a belief based on
misconception.
He did his best to correct this, and
also obtained an assurance from the
British Government that before it took
any action under the terms of the
.European Free Trade set-up, Australia
would be consulted to ensure that her
trading interests in the U.K., as well as
on the Continent, were protected.
“I am convinced that neither the
Kremlin nor the West wants war,” Mr.
Menzies said. “All the leaders of the
West and of the Kremlin believe in a
summit conference in principle, and I
believe, in some way or another, there
will be such a conference.”
He reported that there was still hope
of a loan for the Mt. Isa-Townsville
railway coming from the International
Bank. He has suggested the next meet-
ing of the International Monetary Fund
be held in Australia, and had preliminary
discussions on a possible Royal Tour
during the Empire Games in Perth in
1962.
British Labor's Troubles
The United Kingdom Labor party has
been losing ground ever since the Suez
affair.
It saw the downfall of Sir Anthony
Eden with rejoicing. Then it found itself
with an all - too - close association,
■ through its propaganda on the Middle
East, with people who smelled to high
Heaven of the Hungarian atrocities.
Anything the Macmillan Government
did was, to Mr. Gaitskell, bad. He
lectured the Americans, which might
have been good for them if it had been
the right sort of lecture ; but Britons,
living under the shadow of Moscow
threats, began to feel uneasy about the
prospect of having a Government which
looked as if it might not be able to work
with Washington.
Labor’s attitude on Cyprus was by no
means forthright. In domestic politics,
as with Dr. Evatt, most of its prophesies
of disaster presently turned out to be
just bogeys.
It had been all for negotiation and
all for the theory that Moscow was full
of tame theorists who only wanted some-
body to negotiate with them and prove
friendly and all would be well. But
events in Hungary, Iraq, Burma and
Tibet have cut the ground from under
their policies and complaints.
Anything that was left to them in the
international field disappeared when Mr.
Macmillan became the arch-champion of
negotiation and of going more than half-
way with the Kremlin. There are now,
no doubt, leading members of the Gait-
skell “Shadow Cabinet” who wish that
they had held their fire in order to shout
against “another Munich”; but, no
matter what happens in the near future,
they have been denied that chance.
The last arrow in their quiver seemed
to be nuclear defence, a tricky weapon
to play with. Their aim at a “nuclear
club,” outside Russia and the United
States, which would leave the Americans,
in effect, to fight it out with Russia with-
out allies in the case of war, soon re-
vealed itself as an awful blunder.
And now this has resolved itself into
another disaster in misjudgment when
the big Transport and General Workers’
Union, a Leftist body with over a million
members, repudiated the policy and de-
manded a ban on all nuclear weapons,
suspension of H-bomb manufacture and
an assurance that Britain would not be
the first nation to use the H-bomb —
meaning, seemingly, that if Russia pre-
pared to attack, the British Government
would invite them, like the French at


Fontenoy, to take the courtesy of the
first volley—inevitably against industrial
cities full of workers.
This leaves Labor divided. The
division is the more unfortunate because
the party is weak, maladroit and uncer-
tain in leadership, and because all the
workers in nationalised industries, such
as coal and railways and transport, are
having a fine exhibition of what happens
under socialism.
And they are not amused with the
authors of it in the U.K.
Aid for Misfortunates
Any responsible person who has even
a passing acquaintance with Victorian
courts will welcome the new deal for
young (and not-so-young) offenders pro-
posed by the new Department of Social
Welfare, and especially the efforts pro-
posed to be made to prevent their
becoming offenders.
There are, of course, any number of
uniformed officials of various sorts ready
to place before a judge or magistrate
evidence of an offence, faithfully stereo-
typed in the pattern they have been
taught and which can seldom be the truth,
the whole truth and nothing but the
truth ; but there are very few available
to place the human facts before them.
The entire Melbourne judicial system
struggles on, including the very busy
suburban courts, with the help of a
Salvation Army brigadier, a Salvation
Army female major, an Anglican nun,
a Catholic social worker and several
novitiates ; the Anglicans withdrew their
male social worker apparently because
of the expense. It is only a slight
exaggeration to say the Salvation Army
carries all the burden. “I don’t know
how I could carry on effectively,
brigadier, without your help,” said a
Supreme Court justice recently.
The new department, an offshoot of
the Chief Secretary’s, will aim at finding-
out the reasons for child-delinquency
and giving preventive treatment, co-
ordinating the activities of small
organisations and most of the Child
Welfare Department’s. This will cover
adoptions, infant-life protection, un-
married mothers, child-care; and the
work on youth-delinquency and -welfare
will be intensified.
The probation and parole division will
be merely an enlargement of the current
board. The introduction of the probation
system in Victoria has been an outstand-
ing success, stunning the Government,
whose Ministers cannot refrain from
gloating about it. It is obvious they
sincerely believed, before the figures
showed them to be so ignorant, that it
was better to make jail-birds of first
offenders than to start them off anew on
probation.
The extension and introduction of
these services to the misfortunates of
the community will require more trained
rnen and women, and the training divi-
sion is being established to groom them
for it. “There is a serious shortage of
trained people in many phases of social
work/’ notes Chief Secretary Rylah
gravely, although there was, of course,
no future in training for a job that did
not exist until the Government’s decision
to create the department.
Peace Through Economics
The greatest danger from Russia is not
strategic or military but industrial and
economic, writes Sir Miles Thomas,
D.F.C., chairman of Monsanto Chemi-
cals, Ltd., chairman of the British
Productivity Council, and a director of
other companies, in the course of a lucid
and very well-informed article for the
Institute of Public Affairs Victoria.
(He was Nuffield’s managing-director
until he took-over production jobs for
the British Government during the war ;
and in 1949, when he became chairman
of 8.0.A.C., he turned an annual loss
of £8 million into good profits. He is an
advocate of telling all workers, from the
boardrooms to the factory-floors, what
is going on in companies and in their
activities.)
The fight for survival today is, above
all else, an economic fight, and obvi-
ously the way to achieve success is by
the fullest use of resources —by produc-
tivity.
It has long been apparent in the U.S.
that with modern production methods
and proper understanding of produc-
tivity, low unit-costs go hand-in-
hand with increasing real standards-of-
living ; but this does not work only in
North America.
In the seven years from 1949, weekly
earnings in Germany rose by more than
50 per cent., but productivity kept pace,
and labor costs per unit of output
actually fell by 15 per cent.; so the 50
per cent, increase in wages was paid
wholly in real money. It was accom-
panied by no inflation: it meant a real
and total increase in the standard-of-
living, and it effected no decrease in the
Germans’ competitive power in world
trade.
Actually it improved their competitive
power by expanding the home markets.
A great many people think of the
Russians as a pastoral people who spend
most of their time being misled by Com-
munist commissars, swilling vodka and
generally pursuing extremely earthy
activities ; but Russia’s productivity rose,
according to reports, by 44 per cent,
between 1950 and 1955, and there are
plans for further increases.
If the Commonwealth countries match
the Russians in expansion and further
improve the efficiency of their produc-
tion, it means higher living-standards all
round, but if we fail to match their
efforts it can mean economic domina-
tion ; and that would be greater than any
military strength as an argument for the
power of the Soviet system.
With mass markets running to
hundreds-of-millions of people, the
Russians have a frightening export
potential which could undermine our own
chances. Therefore it is essential for the
Commonwealth to see that its standards
of productivity rise.
If productivity in both East and West
rises there is nothing to fear. Indeed,
there is all to welcome, all to gain, pro-
vided we handle it intelligently. If we
can find a way to increase world pro-
ductivity and share its fruits, we will
have made the largest step forward ever
in history towards ensuring a peaceful
future for mankind.
Toe in Mouth
Senator F. P. McManus is the latest
exponent on the tortuous policy of
D.L.P.-ism.
He said that the Democratic Labor
party would review the position before
deciding where its preferences would go
at the 1961 Federal election. He declared
that it had supported the Menzies
Government at the last election because
it was “the lesser of two evils,” but
that now “another choice may be forced
on us,” with the Menzies Government
considerably receded in the market.
He had, he declared, never suspected
that a month or two after the poll Mr.
Menzies’s chief deputy would say that
recognition of Red China was inevitable,
and had never anticipated that the
Government, supposedly “four-square
against Communism,” would announce
in a month or so that it was reopening
diplomatic relations with Russia.
Senator McManus, of course, wanted
to be clear that he was “not threatening
the Menzies Government.” He was
merely stating that “before his party
decided on allocation of its preferences
it wanted to know where the opposing
parties stood.” He added, in that quaint
Hibernian way Labor politicians have,
that “if we find we have been run up
a tree by people who pretend they will
do one thing and then do another, we
are not without ways and means of show-
ing people we can strike back,” and “if
there were people in the Evatt party who
will clean-up their house, we will be
prepared to have a look at them.”
With the utterance of these sentiments
by the Deputy Leader of the D.L.P.,
not casually but after due thought, to
the annual conference of the party, the
position seems to be that the D.L.P. is
up for sale to the highest bidder on the
anti-Communism issue.
The main inference to be drawn from
the statement is that if the Menzies
Government won’t play and follow
D.L.P. policies to the letter, then the
D.L.P. has no means of survival unless
it can find some other rock to attach
itself to.
The rock it has its eye on evidently is
the Old Gang of the A.L.P., and it is
engaged in tempting its old associates,
or the Cahillite elements among them,
to kiss and make friends.
Senator McManus and his fellow
D.L.P. members of Parliament are
obviously finding out that this is a chilly
world for splinter parties, one in which
they are denied the fruits of politics
because of the “undemocratic electoral
system,” and they yearn to be back
among the fleshpots and the bhoys of
the caucus.


Society
"AND IT'S PRINTED
WITH WIMBLES INKS"
A car-load returning from an evening
meeting saw at the side of a
dimly-lit street a man having trouble
with his car-door. Filled with brotherly
interest, they joined him. “Don’t know
what’s the matter with the lock,” he
said; “I haven't had the car long and
no trouble before, but the key’s jam-
ming.” He stood back and gave the door
an exasperated kick, not the first by the
look of the duco. Advice flowed freely,
the car was shaken, the door thumped
with fists and knees. One determined
character brought across a large flat
stone from the gutter and looked
questioningly at the weary owner. “Yes,
give it a go,” he said, “I’ll have to get it
open some way.” So —bang! And more
new duco went west, but no resultant
spring of the lock. Just as consideration
was being given to breaking the window,
a hail came from one of the group who
had wandered down the street and was
standing beside a similar two-tone model
of the Great Australian Car. “This
wouldn’t by any chance be your car,
would it?” “Crikey,” said the startled
owner opening the door with ease, “what
do you know!” He gave an uncom-
fortable look at the recent scene of
battle. “Well, thanks a lot, boys. I’d
better get going before the other chaps
come out” —and he whizzed-off into the
night. The rescue-party hurriedly fol-
lowed suit, leaving a forever-mystery for
an unfortunate car - owner’s arrival. —

“Dileabach”: Bill had a job with us
for a few weeks, then disappeared, and
the team was naturally anxious to find
out what had happened to him —knowing
from his talk that he was a wanderer.
“He told me he was separated from his
wife,” said the boss, “but he has four
kids. He told me that for his taxation.”
“His sister tells me,” says Jim, “that the
wife part is right, but there’s no kids.”
“Ah,” says the boss, “perhaps he’s like
these Rugby plsryers and counts tries.”
As the scion of a family of duellists
famous for missing their oppo-
nents, I hold the greatest sympathy for
those two Argentinian champion-shot
duellists who, the cables report, missed
each other with successive shots at 10
paces. An ancestor, Sir Bloodwing
Boobe, who fought
with the Water-
purifying Corps at
Hastings, started the
family’s tradition in
a duel with arrows
following a vile im-
pugning of his honor
over a trifling matter
of five aces. They
fought at two paces ;
Sir Bloodwing was
arrowed through the
cuff-link, but sur-
vived. Having been
on a bender the night
before, Sir B.’s aim
was not quite what
it should have been,
and he transfixed
the umpire. Dingbat
Boobe, who during
the Peninsular War
covered himself with
glory in the Leave-
pass section of Base
Records, fought a
duel, and made his-
tory by nominating
as the challenger
field-guns with grape-
shot at six paces.
He sustained only a
set of fine red
whiskers reduced to
ashes from the blast-
off from his opponent’s weapon. Ding-
bat, who was cockeyed, shot a full colonel
a quarter-of-a-mile away, and for this
earned the undying gratitude of the
General Staff. The last in the family to
survive a duel was my great-uncle
Cadwallader, a midmette-fancier who
pursued his hobby in Paris. It was he
who broke the tradition of missing the
target. When a fellow, maddened with
half-a-glass of bock, spoke truly of the
girl-friend of g.-u. C., he slapped him
across the face with an Iceland-poppy.
The duel took place in the Champs
Elysees at dawn, but not before the con-
testants had agreed that one of them
should fire at the ground and the other
into the air. It is, I think, a tribute to
their steely nerves and steady eye that
neither of them missed!—“Bo.”
THE HUMANITIES
“Over-concentration in universities on science
and technology at the expense of the Arts could
lead to an ‘empty society,’ said Sir Alexander
Canr-Saunders, former director of the London
School of Economics, after six months at the
Australian National University. ’
“My son, beware of mathematics,
Chemistry and hydrostatics;
Don’t get lost in dry statistics,
Economics or ballistics :
Spare a little leisure, please,
To woo the old Humanities.”
“You’re right there, Dad; yes, cool, man,
cool —
I’ll kiss the girls; I’ll rock and roll;
I’ll go and hear those jazzmen give;
I’ll have an evening at the Tiv.!”
“My son, my son; now, don’t you
dare !”
“Don’t flip your lid — you’re just a
square!”
“My son, don’t make me do my lolly ;
Humanities aren’t melancholy ;
The joy is there for those who seek;
Look at the verse I write each week’’— —-

A good gag of Aria’s (B. 24 /6 / ’59)
with the jet pilot being fare-
welled to the tune of “See you yester-
day.” And quite feasible. When Qantas’s
new Boeing 707 jet airliners go into ser-
vice on the Pacific route to London via
the U.S.A. this month, passengers
departing Sydney at 4 p.m. will reach
Honolulu at 8 a.m. the same morning.
They don't quite manage to beat them-
selves all the way to the States, however,
landing in San Francisco at 6 p.m. the
same day as they left Sydney at 4 p.m.
Explanation of course is the west-east
crossing of the International Date Line
whereby you do actually fly into yester-
day. Coming the other way you’re served
a couple of helpings of the same day —
which can have its points, by the same
token. Wife of a Qantas pilot travelling
as a passenger east-west across the
Pacific a few weeks ago found that the
double-up day was her birthday and also
happened to coincide with Mother’s Day.
She put in for —and collected —four
presents. —“P.M.”

“G.R.”: Another for lan Mudie’s
list (B. 3/ 6 / ’59):
It’s raining, it’s pouring,
The old man’s snoring;
He went to bed with a pain in the head
And didn’t get up till the morning.
And yet another:
Tell-tale tit!
Your tongue shall be split,
And all the dogs in our town
Will have a little bit.
“Rostand”: lan Mudie’s Sydney rela-
tions might remember the rhyme to
determine who was to hide in “I spy”:

A meat pie;
Take it out to Bondi.
Bondi wasn’t in;
Give it to the black gin.
Black gin wasn’t in;
Out . . . goes . . . she.
“Shackel Me”: The aid to Latin
referred to by “Second Shackle” is
another version of one well-known in
our family in Tasmania some 40 years
ago:
Amo amas, I loved a lass,
And she was tall and slender.
Amas, amat, I lost my hat,
And found it in the fender.
As an aid to scansion, this one sticks
in the mind:
Down in a ( dactyl )
Deep, dark ( spondee )
Hole sat a ( dactyl)
Cockatoo ( dactyl)
Learning his ( dactyl )
Virgil (spondee),
and it goes on with something about
fishermen’s wives and dead sprats: any-
one know it?
No doubt lan Mudie used one of the
versions of this one:
One, two, three; Mother caught a flea,
Put it in the teapot to make a cup of tea.
When she put the milk in, the flea came to'
the top;
When she put the sugar in, the flea went pop.
Another brief and pithy grace is:
The Lord be praised, my waistcoat’s raised.
“Ah, Well, Miss Trilby, I s’pose We'd better do a bit more toil.”
'T'hey started selling TV - sets in
Queensland on July 1, and the
advertising fellows had a wonderful time.
Have waded through a 60-page supple-
ment of a daily newspaper and have
learned that you just don’t buy a TV-
set in the same way you buy a pair of
socks. There are about 25 “famous-
name”, brands to choose from and each
brand apparently has “special features”;
also there are “friendly dealers,” “firms
you can trust” and “thinking buyers.”
We have learned new phrases: “electro-
static focus,” “balanced line-hold,” “true
interlace,” “optimum reception,” “ger-
manium diodes” —and the expression that
I like best of all, “the thrilling oneness
of sound and picture.” My old favorite
shoe-shop is now a gaily painted TV-
store and as a prospective “thinking
buyer” I am at the moment bewitched,
bothered and bewildered. —“Mitron.”

“0.G.”: At Darwin, on my first sea
voyage, I put my head through a port-
hole and watched fish swimming. A
wire rope from the stern passed below
my face to a bollard on the wharf ; the
ship was rolling gently and at times I
could almost kiss the rope. I raised my
head and looked across the wharf;
another roll came on and I felt the rope
under my chin: the back of my neck
touched the top of the porthole—and
then the roll reversed. I pulled my head
in, and thought: “A bloke could have
a nasty accident like that.” Months later
I read of an Indian sailor being decapi-
tated by a steel rope which caught him
with his head through a porthole on a
rolling ship.

gestion that a boy from a home carpeted

not contend that good-manners should
be added to the overcrowded curriculum
of the technical college, and subsequently
accuse your teacher of talking through
his headgear because he questioned this
shifting of responsibility? And if there’s
a moral to be pointed in the quoted
example of the private firm in U.S. which
instructs its employees on customer-
tradesman relations, isn’t it that Aus-
tralian firms, not technical colleges,
should adopt such methods? Very well;

“Spooks”: Chinese stowaways in the

Wyndham (W.A.) that belonged to a
petrified Chinaman. He was a Chinese
cook who loved his master’s rum. His
infuriated boss decided to teach him a
lesson, and talked in his hearing of the
debit-debit in bottles, some days later
adding several Cockle’s pills to the rum-
bottle. The rum-drinking cook took his
usual secret swigs, revelled in the hot
taste till the pills took over, and then,
writhing in the terrific pain, picked-up
a shotgun that stood by the veranda-rail
and fired it into his stomach to kill the
debit. After the inquest the cook was
buried in the marshland that borders
Cambridge Gulf. The years rolled
on ; some of his relatives, returning to
China, decided to take his remains for
burial in his birthplace. To their amaze-
ment, Cookie had become a statue in
stone, and as a statue in stone, long to
be discussed and marvelled over, he went
back home.

O’ Jai’ : At the club, we happened to
see a revival of “The Royal Journey
Across Canada,” the then Princess
Elizabeth and her husband playing
the leading roles, getting in and out
of aeroplanes and cars, and on and off
ships and sledges. A Canadian Mountie
was seen to help the Princess out of a
car, and a huge handsome male, dressed
in furs, got her off a sledge. But nary
a word did the press of 1951 mention of
these blokes “committing the unforgive-
able sin—according to protocol—of
touching Royalty.” Why pick on Presi-
dent Eisenhower? He, like the Mountie
and the fur-clad guy, was doing only
what a gentleman should.

“P.0.M.C.”: All public utilities have
skeleton-staffs on hand over weekends

with most customers is that, instead of
carefully consulting the telephone-book

they ring the wrong places and expect
staff on other duties to do the right thing
by thfem without further trouble to them-
selves. Also, most people seem to get
testy, even abusive, when complaining
about an essential service that has broken-
down and, such is human nature, inspire
tardy, rather than prompt, responses to
their SOS. In theory, all public-utilities
demand courtesy from their staffs; in
fact, they rarely get it from the public.

It was a boom-town then ; the miners

tears when he sang “Please Give Me a

“Judee”: Grubbing in Grandad’s old

new principle, rendering it clear, com-
pletely transparent and free from all
impurities.”- A storage cellar was to hold
30 tons “in case of a possible break-
down,” and it was intended to sell it at
Id. per lb. retail and |-d. wholesale to
“hotels, shipping, etc.” If those pioneers
could have looked forward to the days
of fridges and deep-freezes! Nowadays
iceworks are following the dodo. There
are now only two on Sydney’s North
Shore, one at North Sydney, the other
at Hornsby. A third at Chatswood gave
up the ghost a year or two ago.

a record. Twelve months later the out-
put was only 31,247. But in the same
period the production of power-mowers
rose to 168,504 (it was 77,929 the year
before). The same figure-checker tells
us that in 1956 our output of TV-sets
was only 2636 ; 12 months later the total
was 285,315. The way things are going,
even power-mowers will be down in a
few years unless they are fitted with TV.

As Peter Mann says in his
article on budgies (B. 10/6 / ’59), it is
difficult to estimate the number in the
country. The Ring Registrar of the
Budgerigar Council of Australia has
ready for distribution in Victoria alone
some 150,000 rings, for this coming
season. With late applications for rings,
which may be ordered until the end of
December, the number will probably top
the quarter-million. These rings go only
on birds that may be shown—-they have
to be ringed before the chicks are five
days old or the rings won’t go over their
feet and are confined to show-
enthusiasts. Two farmers in my district
(Vic.) cultivate budgies for the main part
of their income, and they don’t ring a
single bird. At a conservative estimate
I’d say the number of caged budgies in
this country lies between 10- and 30-
million, each pair of which could com-
fortably rear 10 bonny babies a year —
and each may look forward to about
eight breeding-seasons. They appear to
have a breeding-capacity rivalling that
of the rabbit; they have enormous
appetites: the C.5.1.R.0. had better start
looking for a virus or something to con-
trol them when they reach plague
proportions.
AMBITION
There are some things I’d like to do
Before I conk.. One of them’s to
Unleash a haughty stare
And icy-voiced: “Ar, shut your trap!”
When traffic-cop, all snarl and snap,
Roars: “Hey, you —pull in there!”
At TV-screen to talk-back so
They’d hear me in the studio
And my opinion terse :
That, than some females howling on
(While plugging ads.) in unison
There’s ready nothing worse.
I’d like to sue for damages
On grounds of broken promises —
And get a thumping wad —
Some arrogant politico
Who dearly loves to think he’s so
Important—which is odd.
To see the mokes, in indolence,
Leaning against the Paddock fence
Discussing form and breed,
Watching the punters race the course,
While comes a neigh from every horse
Urging their greater speed.
To look-in on dictators’ lives
At moments when their irate wives
Are dictating to them ;
To see fed to the lions chaps
Who make pop-tunes from bits and
scraps
Of Brahms’s Requiem.
This above all, though, I would choose:
To watch the night-club waiter lose
His customary poise,
When, scorning c hie ken-M ary land,
I’d order, in the manner grand,
A brace of saveloys!

POLITICAL POINTS
The Commonwealth Cabinet is sitting
on the Federal Budget this week while
Granny “Herald” sniffs the air and finds
it smelling of “optimism” because the
cash deficit is likely to be £80.5 million
less than was budgeted for. The Taxation
Commissioner will scarcely share the
optimism. His collections fell short of
estimate by £16.6 million, and were £3l
million less than the year before, with a
bad period ahead reflecting last year's
wool slump. No doubt he will be fighting
for his full pound of flesh like a tiger,
though he might get more in the end by
tax-reductions favoring expansion, and
easing burdens like the payroll-tax.

Whatever is not known about the
Budget, it is clear that it will need a
Landy or an Elliott to keep up with the
pace of the financial debates this year:
Meeting in August, the plan is to close
the session before the Commonwealth
Parliamentary Conference opens (it takes
place in Canberra at the end of October).
Anyway, no member worries much about
financial debates—unless they touch
salaries of M.P.s.

still buys more of our wool than any
other country. Figures also show that
more than 400 U.K. companies are
established as manufacturers in Aus-
tralia, either as independent units or in
conjunction with Australian firms. Britain
was responsible for £456 million —or
more than half—of the £712 million
invested by overseas companies in Aus-
tralia between J 947-48 and 1956-57.
Preliminary figures suggest that in the
year just closed overseas investment has
continued at the rate of about £lOO
million annually, of which more than
half has again been of British origin.
Much of the. post-war British investment
had been directly in manufacturing in-
dustries, rather than in the traditional
fields, such as mining and insurance.

The Lee Government in Singapore is
turning-out unexpectedly moderate, but
it is not clear whether this is due to (a)
realisation that it depends on the good
graces of Malaya for prosperity ; (6)
fear engendered by the flight of the press
and big business; or (c) a fear, like
Kassem’s in Baghdad, that the Com-
munists may take-over by Red-anting
his party if he plays too intimately with
them.
Big Four talks were resumed at
Geneva on Monday and were pre-
ceded by the usual flood of platitudes,
about the noblest of which was perhaps
Mr. Herter’s: “We shall continue our
efforts to find reasonable and fair solu-
tions.” Mr. Gromyko wants a “new
interest in the success of the conference
on the part of the Western Powers.” All
the rest of the world wants is for every-
body at Geneva to shut-up and act —if
Khrushchev will let them.

[From Canberra!
External Affairs Minister R. G. Casey
has held his portfolio for just over eight
years—from April 27, 1951. This was
stated officially as being a record, but
what was not stated is that he also holds
the record for the highest number of over-
seas trips by an Australian Foreign
Minister. Opposition-leader Evatt held
the term record up till last Friday, as he
was External Affairs Minister in the
Labor regimes from October 7, 1941, until
PRESSING-ON REGARDLESS
December 19, 1949. He was followed (in
term of tenure) by S. M. (now Lord)
Bruce, who held the post jointly with
the Prime Ministership from February 9,

New South Wales Railways are
reported to be about to make a drive
for more passenger-patronage. They have
lost patronage on Sydney’s North Shore
line because of overcrowding of trains
during peak-hours. The line can carry
more trains during peak periods, but
they are not supplied, especially on the
length of track from Hornsby to Lind-
field. More and more residents beyond
Gordon and Pymble are taking to
driving by car into the city or parking
around North Sydney. The most com-
fortable way to travel into work is by
train—provided there is a fifty - fifty
chance of a seat or reasonable standing-
room, especially for passengers travelling
for over half-an-hour.


The Commonwealth’s overall cash
deficit of £29.5 million for 1958-59, an
improvement of £80.5 million on the
figure anticipated a year earlier, was
principally the result of a greater response
to public loans. Revenue, in fact, was
£l4 million less than Budget estimates,
and expenditure was £l9 million more.
On these figures it looks as though there
was a slight revenue deficit for the year,
compared with a Bulletin estimate,
based on the August, 1958, figures, of
a revenue surplus of £24 million.
Investors have come to the rescue in
two important respects during the 1958-59
financial year. Australian investors have
cut the anticipated Budget cash-deficit to
a fraction, and overseas investors have
put a happier complexion on the balance-
of-payments position. Both have had an
influence on the astonishing boom in
share prices which reached a new peak
last Thursday.

Melbourne Trades Hall Council has
the militant game sewn-up: a unity-

a ticket. The unity boys carried resolu-

its August congress to lay down its appro-
val of reciprocal visits between trade-
union leaders with overseas (Red, of
course) countries ; and the council also
endorsed an A.C.T.U. decision to sponsor
the “Australian-N.Z. Congress fou
Co-operation and Disarmament.”
The A.C.T.U. has reserved the right
to dissociate itself should the congress
“take any action incompatible with
A.C.T.U. policy.”
Considering the A.C.T.U.’s latest form
and the stable from which “Disarma-

Canberra, hotbed of political mis-
demeanors, scheming and back-stabbing,
can, nevertheless, lay claim to being Aus-
tralia’s most moral community. Com-
monwealth Statistician Carver released
figures which showed that in 1958 Can-

under 2 p.c., compared with much higher
rates in the States. In N.S.W. the figure
was over 5 p.c, varying between 4 p.c.
and 6 p.c. in other States.
The overall average for Australia was
4.55 p.c., with total illegitimate births
last year numbering 10,131. N.S.W. had
the highest number of illegitimates—
-3832 —but also had the highest number
of births—Bo,o4s. Total births in Aus-
tralia last year numbered 222,504 —a
record for any year, and the tenth con-
secutive annual increase in birth-
numbers.

The post-war growth of Australian
industry is demonstrated by official
figures, after one makes allowance for
inflation. The number of factories in
Australia has more than doubled in the
20-odd years since the outbreak of War
11, while the value of output has in-
creased by 800 per cent., and output
(money-value) per employee has shown a
400-p.c. increase in the same period. At
June 30, 1958, there were 53,200 factories
in Australia, compared with fewer than
27,000 immediately before the war.
People employed grew from 565,106 in
1938-39 to 1,073,807 in 1957-58.
The value of employees’ output, in
money terms, and therefore blown-up
probably threefold by inflation, increased
from approximately £lOO per employee
pre-war to £4OO.
Value of factory - output was
£500,420,000 in 1938-39 ; this increased
to £4,273,882,000 for 1957-58. Most of
the factories were of the small owner-
employee type, employing four or less
persons. Only 75 of the total number
of factories had a staff exceeding 1000.

journey. On the way he passed the
wreckage of a U.S. Air Force bomber,

220-mile walk took 11 days ; the priest
made the return-journey by air in 35

John Cox was with them and found
himself in action against the Uhlans next
day. From Mons the regiment fell back
and, on August 27, in a rearguard action
at Etreux, wiped-out the greater part of
a German division. Cox ended that
retreat as a sergeant commanding a sec-
tion of machine - guns, and with the
French Croix de Guerre. Transferred to
the Irish Guards as R.S.M., he joined
Mike O'Leary in the legendary assault

Hill 60 and Messines Ridge. Then he
went to Java, Labuan and New Guinea.
In War II Cox was with the New
Guinea Volunteer Rifles —he was work-
ing on the Lae-Markham Valley road at
the outbreak —and, disliking base-jobs,
linked-up with the 24th Battalion for the
capture of Lae and Salamaua. This

Born at Swansea (Tas.) and educated
at Launceston Church of England
Grammar, Gwynydd Purves Meredith
started his military career by joining the
Tasmanian Rangers, a volunteer regi-
ment, at the age of 17. In 1910 he
qualified for a commission in the Royal Aus-
tralian Artillery and was' trained at Sydney’s
Victoria Barracks under Colonels Clarke and
“Gruffy” Kingdom. Stationed at Brisbane and
Thursday Island before War I, he remained
on in England after the Armistice, working at
“demob.” h.q. and later at Australia House.
He also did a course at the Royal Military
College of Science and qualified “p.a.c.,” then
came back to Australia as first inspector of
munitions for the Munitions Supply Board. He
was five years in this appointment, then went
back to A.H.Q. and later was C.O. of the 3rd
Heavy Brigade, R.A.A., in Westralia. For a
change of scenery he spent three months with
his son, who was then serving with the
Northamptonshire Regiment at Razmak, on the
north-west frontier of India, before coming
back to command the Ist Heavy Brigade in
Sydney.
Promoted colonel on the outbreak of War 11,
Meredith was appointed Director of Mechanisa-
tion and, when he had got the 2nd A.I.F. away,
became Director of Artillery. Transferred to
Brisbane in command of coast defence and
anti-aircraft artillery, he served for the rest
of the war there and at Cairns (Q.), retiring
in 1946. A few years later he was offered a
job with the Americans in Japan —in charge
of small-arms at the Tokyo Arsenal. Accepting
this post, he was there from 1950-52, during the
early days of the Korean War. When the
American-Japanese peace-treaty was signed,
which forbade non-Americans to hold official
positions in Japan, he went to Korea, where
the Bth Army created a post for him as
civilian chief-inspector of ammunition and
explosives. From 1954-56 he trained the Korean


Army in ordnance-duties, and for this was
awarded the Chumgmu (Distinguished Military
Service Cross) and the Ulchi, another Korean
decoration. In 1956 health compelled Brigadier
Meredith to leave Korea, and he came to settle
in Sydney, where he now lives, enjoying the
sun around Palm Beach.

with improving the quality of meat, par-

start of War II he was with the N.Z.

city that made full use of his scholastic

“Amcee”: One who will mourn the
passing of Wally Dowling (B. 24/6/’59)
is Pelican, his 18-year-old native stock-
man and adopted son. Wally found him,
a tiny baby, along the route, lying beside
his dead parents, and reared him on
milk from a she-camel in the droving-
plant. He named the lad Pelican because
of his ability to swallow food. Once
when a horse fell and rolled on him,
injuring several ribs and causing tem-
porary paralysis, Wally lay for a fort-
night near a waterhole on the Canning
(W.A.) stock-route, tended by his native
stockman until he was able to ride again.
Wally had the true bushman’s toughness.
Once, while on the track, he fractured
a leg. Setting the bones as well as he
could, he got the boys to kill a bullock,
and wrapped JLhe greenhide around the
limb to form a splint. His leg was after-

ABORIGINALITIES
"T'he decision of the Adelaide City
•*- Council to beautify the long-neglected
part of the River Torrens banks below
the weir which retains Torrens Lake has
stirred-up a controversy over the naming
of the area. For many years it has been
popularly known as Pinky Flat, and in
the early 1930’s it was Adelaide’s equi-
valent of Sydney’s Happy Valley and
Melbourne’s Dudley Flats as the site for
shacks built by homeless unemployed ;
and the general assumption has been
that the name derived from the fact that
derelicts congregated there to drink cheap
wine.
For that reason the authorities turned-
up their noses at the thought of perpetuat-
ing the name in connection with their
new parklands. They decreed that it
must go. “Old Ford Gardens” was sug-
gested as something more suitable. This
had nothing to do with T-model Tin
Lizzies; it was a recognition of the
fact that the early settlers used to ford
the stream in that vicinity.
Mention of early settlers, however,
brought protests that Pinky Flat was
Pinky Flat long before booze-artists ever
started drinking pinky there. One “Adver-
tiser” correspondent suggested that the
name was derived from a small burrow-
ing animal about the size of a rabbit
which was common there in the first
years of the colony, and this was
corroborated by others who could re-
member hearing the name pinky applied
to “bandicoot-like animals which were
very plentiful on the Lower North
Plains.”
Another critic remembered a little pink
flower “like a star,” which grew along
the Torrens banks, and which the blacks
called “Pinkejoo-vor-benjeroo-vor ca-
anboo,” which apparently meant “five
little stars.”
If these excursions into folklore aren’t
authentic, they deserve to be, so the best
thing the Adelaide City Council could
do would be to acclimatise a few bandi-
coots to the new gardens, strew the place
with seeds of pinkejoo-vor-benjeroo-etc.,
and' forget all about the Old Ford.
Admittedly Henry made a lady out of
Lizzie, but apparently Pinky Flat doesn’t
need refining after all. It’s pure enough
already.

“Amdee”: My first trip to South
Brook Island, midway between Cardwell
and the Barrier Reef (N.Q.), was made
in a 12ft. flattie powered by an outboard
motor, calm seas enabling me to approach
safely over coral-gardens and nigger-
heads clearly visible through crystal
water. A huge structure of hardwood
girders, painted red, was the beacon that
guided me to the beach. These massive
timbers were supports, set at intervals
up tlje hillside, for an aerial cable lead-
ing to the lighthouse at the summit. I
found that the cable, flying-fox and sup-
ports were either rotted or rusted into
uselessness. It wasn’t till my next trip,
which coincided with the arrival of the
lighthouse-supply ship Cape Leeuwin,
that the method of servicing this un-
attended light was revealed. Soon after
the steamer anchored, a huge grey barge
was hoisted off the deck, lowered over-
board into a choppy sea, and was soon
chugging landwards. It swept through the
surf, to reveal itself on the beach as an
amphibian which, grinding and lurching

BIRD-CALLS ALL DAY
(From “In My Land Now”)
In my land now
the jewel-beetles in the hop-bush gleam
with iridescent turquoise, piercing bright,
and peacock-green. Wine and rust and
gold
the hop-bush burns, shining with fiery
life,
green and green against the greys and
blues
of saltbush and the mallees that grow
there.
And where the sandalwood, that has
escaped
the fate of exile in a foreign land,
grows still unsought, but fragrant as the
wind,
the nankeen kestrel hunts on sickle wings,
hunts in the shimmering blue above a sea
of bull-oaks, black upon the hill. And
there
corellas fly, like stars blown from their
course,
wailing and complaining, adding now
another shadow to the land below
rolling and bare, the foothills of the range.
And there a million ants seek sweetness in
the spotted bells of eremophila,
and there that traveller, the quandong,
grows,
moving out further yet, but rooted deep,
strong on the native pine. Bird-calls all
day:
the honey-eaters and the soaring larks;
and underneath the grasshoppers have laid
a hot, bewildering disarray of sound.

Unlike “Angus McScupper” (B.

case of H.M.S. Weston-super-mare, an
escort-vessel named after the consti-
tuency of the then First Lord. Jolly Jack
reacted rapidly to both the mouthful and
the cap-ribbonful; the latter prevented
him tying his tiddley-bow over the regu-
lation left ear —let alone the illegal, but
favored, left eyebrow. Finally, some
humorist spotted the connotation possi-
bilities of the name with that of Dame
Agnes Weston, a staunch teetotaller and
founder of Sailors’ Rest Homes. The
resultant “Aggie-on-Horseback” turned
the trick; the vessel was officially re-
named H.M.S. Weston. —“Freddie.”

small boys can’t swipe the coconut-ice,

water-storage they make excellent insect-
proof bins for seed ; cut in halves they’re
used by pig-farmers for boiling-down;
fitted with sprinklers they make excellent
water-carts on road-construction. I’ve
seen some in Queensland that have been
in service as water-tanks for nearly 100
years, and still going strong. It was in
half a ship’s tank, used for curing beche-
de-mer, that Mrs. Watson, with her young
son and a loyal Chinese servant, tried
to escape from Lizard Island (N.Q.) when
besieged by wild aborigines almost a
century ago. The tank drifted for days
towards the Queensland cpast, but the
occupants perished from thirst. It’s now
in the Brisbane Museum.

THE ILL-LUCK OF LA PEROUSE
T> ecovering bits and pieces of long-lost
ships has become something of a
hobby in recent years. The latest addition
to the list to be reported H a batch of
relics from La Perouse’s frigate Boussole,
which, with its companion - vessel
Astrolabe, was at Botany Bay in January-
March, 1788, and disappeared soon
afterwards.
Thirty-eight years later, evidence dev-
eloped to indicate that the ships had
crashed near Vanikoro, in the Santa Cruz
group (about 2000 miles north - east of
Sydney), and now an expedition—British,
French and Belgian—has announced the
finding of fresh evidence on the point
in that area.
Whatever the nature of these dis-
coveries, it seems unlikely that they will
shed any light on the most tragic and
mysterious aspect of the La Perouse
affair: that is, not the loss of the ships,
but the fate of the able and gallant
French explorer and the entire company
of his two vessels. We know well enough
that he lost about a dozen men, including
his second-in-command, by massacre in
Samoa during the voyage south. We also
know that one of his chief colleagues
died at Botany Bay. But, in all proba-
bility, we shall never know whether he
and the remainder of his company were
killed by natives or simply lost at sea.
Commenting on the new report, a
writer in the “S.M. Herald” says that
La Perouse’s arrival at Botany Bay was
“only two days too late to claim Aust-
ralia for France,” and the same news-
paper, in a leader, remarks that the
French explorer “yielded chivalrously to
Phillip’s prior claim to eastern Aust-
ralia.”
In fact, La Perouse reached New
Holland (“Australia” didn’t exist then)
six days behind our First Fleet; and
whatever his instructions may have been
regarding other parts of this continent,
there was no question of his “yielding,”
chivalrously or otherwise, to Governor
Phillip, since he knew quite well that
Cook had annexed eastern Australia for
Britain back in 1770.
La Perouse appears, indeed, to have
expected to find a settlement already
established at Botany Bay, and doubtless
he was somewhat surprised to find Phillip
“ It's probably just as Well — I'm afraid of
heights, anyway."
and Co. in the process of moving north
to Port Jackson.
Anyway, there was no trouble at all
between the British and French in those
summery days at Botany Bay, and the
good, relations thus begun are still
manifest through the medium of various
memorials at the spot, with the grave of
Louis Receveur as a focusing-point.
Receveur, a Franciscan friar and natur-
alist, died aboard the Astrolabe on Feb-
ruary 17, 1788, and was buried on the
north shore of the bay. Nearly 100 years
later a French naval officer tried, un-
successfully, to purchase the area for his
country, and later again W. A. Holman,
as N.S.W. Premier, failed in an attempt
to present the area to France. The catch
in each case, it appears, was a matter of
international law.
So, then, the general impression that
France owns land at Botany Bay is
erroneous, though, it is true, French
celebrations are held there, in conjunction
with the La Perouse Monuments Trust,
on July 14 of each year.
La Perouse commemorated Receveur
with an inscription in Latin on a board
nailed to a tree near the grave. A few
months later Governor Phillip saw the
inscribed board, and, realising that it
couldn’t be perman-
ent, replaced it with
a copper-plate carry-
ing the same inscrip-
tion. That plate
subsequently disap-
peared and has
never since been
found.
In 1824 another
French voyager,
Duperrey, cut a
similar inscription
into the wood of a
“red - gum” (ango-
phora?) at the spot,
and 30 years after-
wards a Crown
Lands commissioner
named Simeon
Pearce, acting in
face of many pro-
tests, had the portion
containing the in-
scription removed
from the tree and
sent to a marine
museum in Paris.
Thus, all three of
the Receveur tree-
memorials have
vanished from the
local scene, and two
of them, the La
Perouse board and
the Phillip plate,
have certainly gone
for ever.
What of the Du-
perrey contribution?
Maybe it has shared,
in part, the experi-
ence of the Vla-
mingh plate of 1697,
which, after reposing
on the coast of
W.A. for 121 years,
was souvenired by
a French voyager, Louis de Freycinet,
and taken to Paris. There it remained
lost to view—tucked away in the cup-
board of a museum —-from 1818 to 1940,
after which it was returned by France
to Australia and lodged in the Perth
Museum.
Possibly it was the precedent thus
created that caused the “S.M. Herald,”
when discussing relics of La Perouse, to
suggest that some of the material found
at Vanikoro should be transferred to
“the part of Australia which is named
after the man himself.” Such relics, it
is added, would be “of enduring historic
and romantic interest.”
Hear, hear! And, at the same time,
we might fairly inquire what has become
of that tree-inscription which Duperrey
carved 135 years ago. The parent “red-
gum” has long since gone, but that is
all the more reason why its fragment
should be back at Botany Bay.

THE SHARE-BOOM
around the board
on which share prices are
chalked-up in the foyer of Syd-
ney Stock Exchange, many
brokers last week discussed with
friends and clients the upsurge
in share prices and in the
volume of turnover.
While they did so Mr.
Norman Macgregor, who
chalks-up the quotations,
found it necessary to rub-out
columns of the morning
quotes in order to fit-in after-
noon prices. The board was
inadequate to record the day’s
sales.
On Wednesday of last week
each “call” in the industrial
market took hours longer than
normally, and a complete list
of quotations was delayed
accordingly.
On Thursday the call-room
was still operating after six
o’clock, and brokers and their
clerks worked into the night
sending - out contract - notes.
Friday was quieter.
Many brokers found the
booming sharemarket im-
possible to comprehend. B.H.P.
at over 605., Burns Philp over
925., A.C.I. at over 725., C.S.R. at
£59 —was only the sky the limit?
Overseas buying, institu-
tional buying within Australia,
scrip-shortage, fears of infla-
tion all these factors are
known about, but it is agreed
by most that, even in these
circumstances, everything has
its fair price, and that yields
from an investment, taxation
factors taken into account, are
the ultimate governing in-
fluence in the value of a share,
This truth is all too obvious
when a share disappoints, as in
tne case of Masonite, Paccal
and others.
As soon as a stock misses a
dividend, interim or otherwise,
a leading unit-trust ceases to
buy it.
"I agree modern art has SOMETHING, Clarrie, but banks
are so old-fashioned and ACADEMIC!”
Yet, judged by last week’s
market, one would almost think
that dividends no longer
mattered!
A ll over the world there has
been a buoyancy in
share prices that in some
respects has been abnormal.
Unquestionably taxation inci-
dence and anomalies have had
much to do with the upsurge.
That, of course, is a scathing
comment on our taxation
methods, which have had more
to do with the creation of a
scrip-shortage than anything
else. In a way, too, taxation
is causing inflation.
Also, there is a great feeling
of confidence — : super-optimism,
perhaps—about the brave new
world of technological change
into which we are thought to
be about to burst.
Australia, also, is going
through a period of consider-
able development, in which
basic materials should be in
wide demand.
Our manufacturing capacity
is increasing, in some cases
being now well in excess of
demand, but where this excess
is represented by essential raw
materials and commodities it
means that other secondary
industries can plan with con-
fidence so far as necessary
supplies are concerned.
TIE7E have at last reached the
V V stage, for example, where
supplies of iron and steel are
meeting our requirements. Ex-
pansion in the steel industry
is rightly going on nevertheless,
because it is certain that our
need of these things will grow
with each passing year. And
we should not forget the
desperate shortage of all iron
and steel products that pre-
vailed for several years after
World War 11. It has been
only during the past two or
three years, in fact, that we
have been able to buy gal-
vanised-iron, piping and
fencing-wire for immediate
delivery.
With a broader base in key
industries, the whole economy
is likely to become more stable
and less dependent on exports,
although absolute self - suffi-
ciency is out of the question,
and has never been achieved
even by industrialised countries
which are a century ahead of
us in population and know-
how. And the present annual
growth in Australian popula-
tion, though most inspiring,
does not mean that our
numbers will double in much
under a quarter of a century.
A ustralia’s prospects . are
therefore good, subject to
industrial awards and legis-
lation, but not by themselves

sufficient to justify an optim-
ism that in some cases has
doubled or trebled share
prices over the past five years.
Some smaller, rapidly-growing
companies have easily justified
a multiplication of their share-
market-valuation, but other,
larger concerns which have
enjoyed a virtual monopoly of
our markets for many years
may find that though their
momentum is almost irresistible,
their growth in relation to their
existing capital may now be
comparatively gradual.
Some of these monopolies
have branched-out into a multi-
tude of associated activities
away from the main one on
which they built their fortune —
such as the development of
Australian Glass into Aus-
tralian Consolidated Industries
—but again there are limita-
tions to this.
As in most booms on the
sharemarkets, there is a mix-
ture of “true” and “false” in
the basis of the present one.
The investor will be wise if
he assesses the value of a
stock on its own economic
prospects rather than on the
way the sharemarket seems to
be going in general.
Betting on the market in-
stead of assessing the prospects
of a stock over a period—a long
period or short period, accord-
ing to the tastes or require-
ments of the particular investor
—is the rankest of gambling.
And though a top-quality stock
remains a top-quality stock
regardless of sharemarket
appraisal, there comes a time
when even the best stocks may
be overpriced. Market prices
are set by investors and specu-
lators, not by the company m
which shares are being bought
and sold.
Associated Pulp Moves
A lift in the dividend from
9 p.c. to 11 p.c. and
release of approximate (and
record) profit-figures on July
7 for the year to June 30
accompanied an announcement
by Associated Pulp and Paper
Mills of “pending negotiations.”
The early announcement of
results had the effect which
was apparently desired —a re-
appraisement by the market
of the value of the shares, and
a tendency for them to be
retained by shareholders until
the nature of the “pending”
negotiations was revealed.
There was a jump in quotations
from 455. 9d. to 525.
But a guessing-game ensued
as to who was the party of the
second part engaged in the
negotiations.
In turn the possibilites of
pourparlers with Australian
Paper Manufacturers, Aus-
tralian Newsprint Mills,
Tasmanian Board, Paper
and Board, N.Z. Forest
Products, Bowaters, Wiggins
Teape and various others
were turned over; but the
market, for a day or two,
anyway, took most seriously
the possibility that it might be
Masonite Holdings, Ltd., a
competitor in the building-
board trade, which has lately
been having trouble with its
new No. 2 plant at Eildon
(Vic.).
The sooner a definite state-
ment can be made as to with
whom negotiations are pending
the better it will be for the
sharemarket generally.
Investment Counsel
Tn My Own Story, by Bernard
M. Baruch, U.S. financier
and public servant, friend and
counsellor to U.S. Presidents
and to Winston Churchill, the
writer makes a few comments
which are most apt in Aus-
tralia at the present time:
Repeatedly in my market opera-
tions I have sold a stock when it
was still rising—and that is one
reason why I have held on to my
fortune. Many a time I might
have made a good deal more by
holding a stock, but then I would
also have been caught when the
price of the stock collapsed. If I
have missed some opportunities for
money-making because of this
I have also avoided “going
broke,” as I have seen many other
men do.
Some people boast of selling at
the top of the market and buying
at the bottom—l don’t believe this
can be done except by latter-day
Munchausens. I have bought when
things seemed low enough and sold
when ' they seemed high enough.
In that way I have managed to
avoid being swept along to those
wild extremes of market fluctuation.
Another bit of counsel from
Baruch is to “sell to the sleep-
ing-point.” The wisest course,
he says, is to sell to the point
where one stops worrying.
And this paragraph—coming
from an Americanv financier!
—seems to have some applica-
tion to recent controversy in
Australia:
What both the underdeveloped
and the developed nations should
be striving for is agreement on the
terms that would make private
investment mutually profitable. It
should not be too difficult for an
understanding to be reached on a
set of fair investment practices
between countries. Certainly foreign
investments should always improve
living-standards. They should also
contribute to the training of skills
of every kind in the underdeveloped
countries, steadily expanding the
number of trained workers and
managers. Where local capital is
available it should be given as large
an interest as possible.
Also right to the point in
present-day investment in Aus-
tralia :
In recent years a number of
structural .changes in security
investment have taken place and
are worth careful investigation.
Among these changes are the
remarkable growth of investment-
trusts and mutual funds, also of
tax-free pension-funds and tax-
exempt foundations. With the
change in the [U.S.] laws regulat-
ing their holdings, some institutions,
like life-insurance companies and
savings'- banks, have purchased
stocks.
The [U.S.] capital-gains tax has
made many investors reluctant to
part with their holdings. Many
industries have financed their plant-
expansions through their own
earnings and tax-write-otfs rather
than through capital from outside.
No really thorough study has yet
been made of how the workings of
the stock-market have been altered
by these and other changes.

Mare Oil Subsidies
[From F. Owen]
Tn spite of continued protests—
some from quite unexpected
quarters —as to the inconsist-
ency of the allocation of
grants under the Petroleum
Subsidy Act, 1957-58, the
Minister for National Develop-
ment, Senator W. H. Spooner,
announced on July 5 that a
further £213,000 had been
approved “because the drilling
probably would yield geological
information that would help in
the search for oil in Australia.”
It will be recalled that the
Senator, when the 1957-58 Act
was introduced, stated that the
subsidy would be granted only
for
slratigraphical drilling which is
aimed at obtaining information con-
cerning formations and structures
at depths at which reliable deduc-
tions cannot be made from surface
and geophysical surveys,
and he definitely * excluded
drilling aimed at testing domes or
other suitable geological structures
to see whether they contain oil.
If the term “stratigraphical
drilling” is to retain the mean-
ing universally accepted by
geologists, a very quick exami-
nation of the list of w'ells
already subsidised under the
1957-58 Act will show that
most of them fall under the
category specifically excluded
by the Senator. The same
statement is equally applicable
to the wells now to be allotted
grants.
C.Q. Salt Rise
/Central Queensland Salt
Industries has been
fluctuating sharply during past
weeks between Bs. 6d. and
15s. 9d. Strong buying pushed
the shares from an all-time
“low” to a record “high” of
15s. 9d., with a following
reaction to 11s. 9d. The sharp
rise follows the investigations
by an overseas mining com-
pany as to the possibility of
using the bromide residue of
salt-deposits as the basis of
a chemical industry.
The establishment of such an
industry could prove beneficial
for our not-so-profitable salt
industry.

Sink-holes
[From F. Owen] .
A rticles on salt structures
which have appeared in
these pages have attracted
interesting comment. Several
letters give details as to sink-
holes (to use that term in a
wide sense) in several States.
One correspondent cites
examples near Wyndham
(W.A.) and suggests that:
Now that the presence of salt
has been established in W.A., it
may be that these depressions can
be accepted as possible indications
of a salt dome.
Approximately circular topo-
graphical depressions are by
no means geological rarities;
they are due to a variety of
causes, of which selective
erosion (in which term I
include solution), both surface
and subterranean, is the most
important.
Such erosion occurs com-
monly in limestone and in
plugs of igneous rock and salt,
and the resulting depression,
whatever its origin, is con-
veniently described as a sink-
hole. The determination of its
type is, under normal condi-
tions, a comparatively easy
task for anyone with experi-
ence in this branch of geology ;
however, more evidence than
that contained even in a good
air-photograph is often requisite
for a correct diagnosis.
As to the question asked in
my W.A. correspondent’s
letter, my opinion is that the
available published evidence
(including contradictory
gravity and seismic surveys
carried out by the Bureau of
Mineral Resources) is not suffi-
cient to determine whether the
Ninbing (and other) depres-
sions are surface indications of
salt- domes or are limestone
sink-holes. Any doubt should
be removed by expert exami-
nation.


THE OFFICERS
By “R.R.D.”
Perhaps no Army in living
-*• memory has been called
upon to suffer quite as much
as the French. For a proud
body of officers who take their
profession to heart much more
than the British do, the Vichy
split, the loss of Indo-China
and Tunisia and the present
troubles in Algeria must be
intolerable.
As a result, during the last
few years a group of French
officers has set itself to recon-
sider the problems involved in
fighting a limited war against
subversion and revolution,
basing its conclusions on
experience in Indo-China and
North Africa. Deductions have
been collated under- the title
La Guerre Revolutionnaire,
and the entire issue of the
Revue Militaire d’ Informa-
tion for February, 1957, was
devoted to this subject and was
in such demand that a second
edition had to be printed and
was also sold out.
The doctrine is based on a
study of the methods of insur-
rection successfully employed
against the French, culled from
the precepts of Russian and
Chinese ideologists, strategists
and tacticians. The solution
• —“passion can be fought only
with passion”—may be sum-
marised (in so far as anything
as important as this can be
fairly summarised in an item
of this scope) as total effort in
every possible activity of
human life, with the closest
co-operation between the
forces involved, and the rais-
ing of an ideal standard round
which people can rally.
Before violence breaks out,
the enemy can be parried by
a sound defence-organisation
and by vigorous psychological
warfare; afterwards, the
riposte must spring from the
moral and physical mobilisa-
tion of the people. The suc-
cess of the whole, like that of
a swordsman in mortal com-
bat, must rely on morale.
France has two important
factors in her history which
influence this doctrine. First,
the armies of their own revolu-
tion were ultimately discip-
lined, from their campaigns of
looting and massacre, into
Napoleon Bonaparte’s Grande
Armee, so any form of insur-
rection has always interested
French soldiers profoundly.
Secondly, the tradition of
l’Armee d’ Afrique, led by such
men as Lyautey, aimed at
forming a military elite differ-
ent from the metropolitan
forces, with a sense of mission
aimed at regenerating and
educating society at home and
overseas. “He who is only a
soldier is a bad soldier.” These
colonial officers insisted that
the military and administrative
authority should be in the same
hands at all levels, not only
at the summit. The first duty
of an officer, they said, was to
shape the thought of all
those he came into contact with.
The present theorists have
been trained in this school.
They are officers of long ser-
vice in Asia or Africa and
were at first accused of hav-
ing their military judgment
“deformed” by their experi-
ences in Indo-China. This
criticism has since been swal-
lowed by its makers.
Whether the doctrine is the
final answer to limited war in
such conditions is a question
open to dispute. Many of the
suggestions made by this group
of French officers have been
common practice in the
British Army for some time.
Psychological warfare was used
to great effect in Malaya, for
instance. And the British have
always advocated close con-
tact with the population of
any country they have been
called upon to police—and
have had a worthy ambassador-
at-large called Tommy Atkins.
Implications go deeper and
may help to explain some of
the recent happenings in
Algeria and France. It should
be made clear that General de
Gaulle is not an officer of the
colonial forces —and the divi-
sion between colonial and
metropolitan officers must be
clearly evident to anyone who
has served alongside the
French. But whether a military
elite can influence the ultimate
government of a Western
nation is a question to be
decided.

Czech Wind Quintet
A foretaste of the Czech
Philharmonic Orchestra was
given in the first Australian
performances by the Phil-
harmonic’s Wind Quintet in
Surfers’ Paradise and Brisbane.
These first-desk players of the
orchestra are at the moment
using some of their European
summer vacation doing a quick
winter tour of this country for
the Musica Viva Society. As
with all of this lively society’s
ventures, this one turns out
to be very rewarding.
Composers of music for five
wind instruments appear to
have made the most of the
puckish possibilities of the
sounds that can be produced.
This was true of the Mozart
Divertimento, and certainly of
the Czech music on the pro-
gramme by Rejcha and David,
not to mention the many
encores. But the concert was
not merely an extended bout
of high spirits. At the other
end of the scale there was a
piece by Darius Milhaud
evocative of the countryside
and legends of his native Pro-
vence. This was jovial enough
at times, but more remarkable
for the lovely tone of the
quintet in calling-up the dreamy
atmosphere of this old land of
pipe and tabor, and in sug-
gesting that here there used to
be hunting-songs and courtly
games and dances.
The star of the quintet is the
horn-player, Miroslav Stefek,
a big man who sits calmly at
the back of the stage producing
effortless miracles of tone-
shading that might turn an
ordinary player purple in the
face. Sometimes the clarinet
is reedier than we are used to,
and the oboe has the piercing,
melting tone of some Euro-
pean oboists rather than the
fruitier tone of, say, Leon
Goossens.
The tremendous finish of
their playing together is a
delight, and makes it clear
that if the other 110 players
of the Czech Philharmonic play
with the same discipline and
finesse of these principal wind
soloists, the projected 15 con-
certs in Australia will come
nowhere near filling the de-
mand to hear them.

“Shakspeare for Everyone”
J. C. Williamson’s Shak-
speare Company with its
motto “Shakspeare for Every-
one” continued in precisely
everyone’s vein with its second
production, “A Midsummer
Night’s Dream,” which packed
them in at the Melbourne
Comedy.
Its predecessor having been
“The Merchant,” with “The
"No doubt about it , TV is a menace to our reading-
habits —Harry cant even get round to reading the
positions-vacant columns."
Winter’s Tale” to follow, the
Shakspeare that Melbourne
has been getting to know
is a light-hearted, somewhat
superficial fellow, full of jokes
and hearty good-living, a little
sexy when the occasion de-
mands, mainly conventional in
his philosophising, often
apparently fascinated with
theatrical devices, and, above
all, the striker of romantic
attitudes and the utterer of
bewilderingly “beautiful” verse
whose undoubted wisdom
would seem to exist in the con-
ceivable abstract rather than in
the created world of his
characters.
Whether this is representa-
tive of the Bard at his pro-
foundest is clearly open to
question . . . Nevertheless, it
cannot be denied that Shak-
speare a la J.C.W.’s, John
Alden, the box-office and co.

stuff the public has an appetite
for which augurs well for
the company’s immediate

Pierre Cochereau
At his first solo recital at
Sydney Town Hall the Notre
Dame organist adduced a lot of
evidence, in a first-half devoted
entirely to Bach, that the old
Cantor of St. Thomas’s was far
from being the cold genius of
musical mathematics that
some of his transcribers have
suggested. In the majesty and
power of the fugal section of the
Prelude and Fugue in B
Minor, Cochereau laid that
ghost by stressing with rich
virtuosity the warm human
emotions that lie at the base of
it. The Prelude was a steady
and logical build-up of a
tremendous piece of architec-
ture.
But it was in the great Passa-
caglia and Tema Fugatum,
with its 20 variations crowned
by a magnificent double-fugue,
that Cochereau displayed his
most spectacular effects of
riotous color and great swirl-
ing masses of sound. In all
three works were some epi-
sodes of charming delicacy,
none better than in the softly
repeated phrases of the D
Minor Fugue.
A Suite on the “Veni
Creator” by Maurice Durafle
was heavy going, and the
night’s work ended with some
amazingly fertile improvisa-
tions.
Mary O’Hara
A winning personality with
a blending of bright smile and
demureness; a pleasing
soprano used discreetly within
its limits; an easy mastery
over the small Irish harp on
which she accompanies her
songs ; a mischievous air and,
above all, a natural gift for
telling simple little stories in
song (which is really what
folk-singing is) with these
attributes so strongly in evi-
dence at her first Sydney recital
it was obvious that this Irish
girl just couldn’t miss.
Naturally there were plenty
of songs nostalgic of the Ould
Sod ; but the sentiment in the
voice never dropped to the
maudlin level. Mostly the
songs ranged, gay and grave,
over intimate glimpses of rural
and fishing life in Erin ; but
she would occasionally cross
the Irish Sea to deal with some
rugged aspects of the Scottish
scene ; or go to the Isle of Uist
for a weavers’ song. It was
all very charming and intimate.
Terence Finnegan, an Irish
tenor whose voice had a good
ring to the heights and more
weight than that of the too-
often-heard “silvery” tenor
from those parts, sang brackets
of traditional Irish and Scot-
tish songs with spirit and
feeling. Accompanist William
Davis was an alert collabora-
tor, but as a soloist he lost
on points his bouts with
Brahms, Schumann and a
none-too-helpful piano.

“Clerambard”
For generations English
playwrights have exploited the
drawing-room as a milieu for
fun and sermons. The French
writers, to the great delight of
those who find the English
stuffy, have used the brothel
for their setting. This is known
as Gallic realism—perhaps to
distinguish it from Socialist
realism.
French writers such as
Marcel Ayme do not look for-
ward to a time when the
brothel becomes a home of rest
and culture, but more modestly
to a time when the prostitutes,
aristocrats with a family-tree
but no bank-balance of match-
ing grandeur and all the
family-retainers are touched
with pity and compassion for
each other.
This is the prospect in
Ayme’s “Clerambard,” now at
Canberra Repertory. The
French, we are told, are clear
thinkers. In this play they all
behave as though they were

perpetually five drinks up. One
can enjoy people who are
emotionally drunk, provided
one is not asked to take them
seriously. But Marcel Ayme
expects us to swallow it all—
from the family of cat-eaters
to that other Gallic shaft of
perception at the end, when we
are rather forcibly reminded
that the French, or some
French, believe there is hope
for all of us except the priests.
This could entertain, but it
pretends to instruct —and it is
on that level that it must be
judged. Here the charitable
must be silent, for the spiritual
bankruptcy of the French
theatre is their pain and the
world’s loss.
The performance was un-
even. There was no uniformity
of dress or speech, no attempt
to be French. Jim Hutchens
was excellent as the son of the
pauper aristocrat, and Joyce
Goodes turned-in her usual
finished performance; but
neither producer nor players
seemed to believe in the
author’s message. It was like
hearing a freethinker read the
Lesson at a funeral-service.

Pinafore”
With a cleverly-devised ship’s
deck and novel but effective
entry- and exit-spots, producer
Leo Schofield overcame most
of the restrictions imposed by
the wingless Union Hall when
the Sydney University Players
gave the Gilsullivan opera an
airing. The choruses had
admirable strength and tone,
and were delivered with ebul-
lience.
There was quite a nark of a
Deadeye (David Farraro) and
a spirited Boatswain (Neil
Shard) who sang his “English-
man” number forthrightly.
Elizabeth Laver, vivacious after
a shaky start, and Martin
Rathbone handled the Joseph-
ine and Rackstraw roles fairly
presentably, though their
voices need strengthening.
Peter Drake was a quite com-
manding Commander and
made the most of his limited
opportunities for comedy ; but
Barry Bates brought little flair
for fun to the role of the First
Sea Lord.

“The Tender Trap”
This, at Sydney’s Pocket
Playhouse, concerns an eligible
New York bachelor, with a
little black book full of good
things, who realises the empti-
ness of his ways, but has to be
taught a few lessons about love
before he knows the right
female trap to fall into. Its
first two acts have an attrac-
tive, self-debunking line of
comedy and are charged with
first-class wisecracking dia-
logue ; but then, suddenly
faced with the essential selfish-
ness of its bachelor’s life, it
hastily redirects him, not with
more and more plot, but with
a few sentimental platitudes
about a bachelor’s obligations
to nice girls.
In his neat and spirited pro-
duction, Seamus Rothsey
wisely laid as little weight as
possible on this final weakness,
and the chief actors —John
Humphries, as the bachelor;
Ronald Farrow, as his married
buddy ; Barbara Eather, as the
young and tender trap that
held ; and Ellen Bland, as the
not-so-young but much more
tender trap that didn’t —drew
enough of the engaging
comedy to themselves to
become engagingly comic
throughout.

Vic. Sculptors
The exhibition of “modern
sculpture” by members of the
Victorian Sculptors’ Society
at Farmer’s Blaxland Gallery,
Sydney, is hardly likely to set
the Harbor on fire, since the
same sort of spikes, curves and
constructions grow locally by
the dozen, as they also grow
all over the Western world.
Except where there is a
touch of realism to provide a
firm measuring-stick, as in
Herman Hohaus’s amusing
“Country Girl” or George
Allen’s flying footballers, it is
difficult to pick out an indi-
vidual talent; but, within
their skeletal conventions,
quite a number of pieces
gradually manifest themselves
with some charm or force —
Lenton Parr’s “Flying Man,”
for example, and Clement
Meadmore’s iron spikes that
look like a miniature Gothic
city ; or, simply for the decora-
tive effect of brass on iron,
Max Lyle’s cheerful “Depres-
sion.”

This William Wyler produc-

Shakspeare on TV
The telerecording of
“Antony and Cleopatra” shown
on ABN-2 (Sydney) last week
revealed that Melbourne’s
A.B.C. studios, in their first
“live” production of Shak-
speare, set themselves an even
tougher problem than Syd-
ney’s did with “Hamlet,” and
that they were no more suc-
cessful in their handling of it.
A satisfactory TV-treatment
of this play is probably im-
possible. Even more than
“Hamlet” it cries out for space
and color. Its conflicting
worlds of politics and self-
consuming passion are created
in images of the utmost scope
and vigor, and if a producer
cannot match them in physical
terms he must concentrate on
the richness of the poetry and
look continually for the points
of tension between the two
worlds.
It was precisely on these
counts that Arthur Chipper’s
adaptation and Christopher
Muir’s production most often
wavered ; so that, although the
basic issues were pretty clearly
presented, one rarely got a
strong enough sense of the
spectacular destruction of a
great man by the opposing
demands of his nobility and his
nature.
There was little in the acting
to offset this uncertainty of
approach. Most of the players
flattened the poetry by taking
it too fast, becoming at times
almost unintelligible ; and
often they seemed unsure of
just what changes their
characters were undergoing.
Keith Eden’s Antony, though
not lacking in stature, was
always doomed and a shade
too passive ; and Bettine Kauff-
man’s Cleopatra seldom got
past the outer suburbs of
passion. There was a certain
marble quality in Kevin
Miles’s scarce-bearded Caesar;
and Keith Goodlett fitted him-
self outstandingly to the con-
flicting loyalties of Enobarbus.

The WILD CAT
COLUMN
Consolidated Zinc Corp., Ltd.
A lthough last term’s accounts from
Consolidated Zinc Corp. are some-
thing of a mixed bag, the big U.K.-
registered co. fared reasonably well over
the year, substantial reductions in tax-
provisions and royalties providing partial
compensation for the continued flatness
of world lead and zinc markets.
Weaker metal prices affected various
of C.Z.C.’s numerous interests, the
hardest-hit being the wholly-owned Zinc
Corp. mine at Broken Hill and the
neighboring New Broken Hill mine, in
which the C.Z. group holds a 32 p.c.
share-interest. Voluntary restrictions on
the output from the Barrier mines
brought about a \l\ p.c. fall in Zinc
Corp’s production of zinc concentrates
and a 13 p.c. drop in the output of
recoverable lead, reductions in the
quantities of zinc and sulphuric-acid
turned-out in the U.K., together with
the lower prices obtained for these pro-
ducts, whittling-down earnings from that
source too.
At the same time the return from
other U.K. products, particularly from
zinc oxide, other pigments and zinc
alloys, was fairly well maintained, while
the Australian output of sulphuric-acid
reached the highest level on record,
investment income increased, and the
Queensland beach-mining offshoot,
Titanium and Zirconium Industries Pty.,
turned-in an improved and “substantial”
net profit.
Ore-production at Broken Hill will
continue to be restricted “until such time
as a more favorable outlook for metals
justifies the return to full and normal
operating conditions,” but expansion and
development in other directions continue
apace.
Good progress has been made with
the new smelting-plant at Swansea (U.K.),
and with the design of the smelter to be
erected at Cockle Creek (N.S.W.), where
the subsidiary Sulphide Corp. Pty. is at
present engaged in the manufacture of
sulphuric acid and fertiliser. Scheduled
to begin operations in 1961, the Cockle
Creek smelter will now have a planned
annual capacity of 38,000 tons of zinc
from a single blast-furnace, which will
also be capable of treating lead-bearing
materials for a corresponding output of
lead bullion. An associated sulphuric-acid
plant will be able to produce 250 tons
of acid a day.
To assist in financing the two smelters
and associated plant, the co., last
February, offered shareholders one new
ord. for every six held, at a 140 p.c.
premium, sending paid capital to
£17,767,036. Of this total £7,581,340 is
in 4y p.c. prefs. (All amounts are in
sterling.)
Additional funds will still be required,
and it is expected that these will be
raised by loans floated in Australia.
Looking to the more distant future,
the 50 p.c. - owned Commonwealth
Aluminium Corp. Pty. (“Comalco”) is
pressing on with its investigation into
the economics of producing alumina and
aluminium from the huge bauxite
deposits at Weipa (Q.) and Gove (N.T.).
Cheap and abundant electric power is
essential to the success of this venture,
and with this factor in mind, Comalco
has secured a five-year option over the
Blair Athol (Q.) coalfield, where, on
present indications, the tonnage of coal
available is thought to be adequate for
a continuous output of 700,000 kilo-
watts of power for at least 75 years.
In addition, Comalco’s offer to purchase
the Government holding in New Guinea
Resources Prospecting Co Pty. has been
accepted “in principle,” a condition of
the offer being the grant of rights over
the very substantial hydroelectric poten-
tial of the Purari River in New Guinea.
The board has repeatedly emphasised
the magnitude of the bauxite project
and the time needed to finalise and
execute development-plans, considerations
which, in themselves, do nothing to mini-
mise the exciting long-term possibilities
of the project.
However, if aluminium is ever to rival
zinc and lead as a source of income
it won’t be for many years yet, and the
group’s fortunes remain closely tied to

During 1958 Zinc Corp. treated 659,268
tons of ore (down 107,801 tons) for
115,348 tons of zinc concentrates (down
24,336 tons), 79,098 tons lead (down
11,722 tons) and 2,033,9550 z. silver (down
164,5020 z.). The grade of ore was a
shade higher at 12.9 p.c. lead (12.7 p.c.
in 1957), 3.30 z. silver (3.10 z.) and 10.1
p.c. zinc (10.5 p.c.).

£1,561,625 to £2,899,569, investment-
income, etc. (up £42,517 at £ 1,309,340)
and a £1,391,664 provision for deprecia-
tion (up £82,631) leaving profit before
tax and royalties at £2,728,191. The
£1,594,251 fall in this total was “fully
accounted for” by the drop in the earn-
ings of the Zinc Corp. mine.
Much lower provisions for U.K. and
Australian tax (down £1,175,124 at
£1,069,003) cushioned the impact on net
earnings, as did the £292,077 fall (to
£12,109) in royalty-payments, the scale
on which the latter are charged being
determined by the level of mine-earnings.
As a result, consolidated net profit was
only £152,110 below that of the 1957
term at £1,617,876:

Over the two years to December 31
last the annual tax-provision has shrunk
by £1,983,336 and royalty-payments by
£1,009,424, to limit the fall in earnings
over that period to £426,507. Neverthe-
less, the div.-rate on ord. capital was
cut from 22\ p.c. to 18| p.c. in 1957
and to 15 p.c. last term, these cuts con-
tributing something to the lower tax-bill.
(The immediate div.-return is reduced
by the deduction from divs. of U.K.
income-tax, previously calculated at Bs.

lower rate applying, for the first time,
to last term’s final div.)
Development-work at Broken Hill was
held on a higher scale than that actually

include the £448,000 holding in Comalco

manufacturer of titanium pigments).
Other investments in U.K. concerns relate
to the production of aluminium sulphate,

A sustained recovery in metal prices
may be needed before the board is pre-
pared to lift the div.-rate above 15
p.c., and although zinc quotes have
strengthened in the current year (recent
spot prices on the L.M.E. were around
£stg.Bo a ton), lead is languishing at
around £stg.69 a ton.
Less immediately, future prospects are
attractive and soundly-based but, as a
holding proposition, the 20s. (stg.) ords.
would rate as a long-term investment
at last week’s price of 80s. The yield
at this price from a 15 p.c. div. would
be 4.6 p.c., or 2.8 p.c. after allowing
for U.K. tax.
Swan Brewery Co., Ltd.
Stirling discovered the Swan
River in 1827. In the shadow
of what is now Kings Park, at
the foot of Mt. Eliza, he came
across a spring where he replenished
his stocks of fresh water. Today
if Stirling could revisit the spot
he might be tempted, rather than fill
his barrels with water, to tap the flow
of amber fluid from the close-at-hand
Swan brewery. However, in filling-up
with water there was no question of a
hangover, and no thought of the turmoil
presented by a closing-time swill.
Still, brewers, including the Swan
Brewery Co., do dispense much
creature-comfort, and last year W.A.’s
drinkers no doubt enjoyed themselves
for the most part. If tipplers were satis-
fied, so, too, were shareholders. Both
tankards and div.-cheques were reason-
ably full, and though most pubs in the
West are tied, collar was excessive neither
on the beer drawn nor the profits left
after distribution, or so it would seem
at first glance:

t Excludes depreciation reserve, £1,658,870 at
31/3/’59.
Disclosed profits at £348,784 were down
£39,627 on the previous year, after
writing-off depreciation £259,610 (up
£29,714) and providing for tax £365,734
(up £16,276). All but £3463, which went
into visible reserves, was absorbed
in dividends. But nobody is misled by
this tight-lipped accounting. Reserves
rose during the year by £164,677, the
increase including £150,683 for which
no explanation whatsoever is tendered.
Profit revealed by the accounts, after
payment of the pref. divs. (£3000) repre-
sented, for what the calculation is worth,
an earning-rate on ord. capital of 10.1
p.c., as against the 9.8 p.c., 9.4 p.c. and
11.3 p.c. for the three preceding years.
Swan’s activities extend to all parts of
W.A., and, in addition, the co. supplies
a considerable export market. Its beer
is now brewed in Darwin as well, the
scene of fierce competition with present
rival and one-time associate Carlton and
United Breweries, Ltd. Its province even
stretches across the lonely Nullabor
Plain, evidence the “empties” scattered
along the tracks of the Transcontinental
Railway.
Beer-consumption has tended to level-
off in the last year or so. The spectacular
post-war rise is over. Any increase of
future profits will depend on —provided
drinking - habits don’t change — 1 lower
excise, greater efficiency in cost-control
and/or increased exploitation of the
export market, and, in the long - term,
population-growth.
Last term the co. effected large-scale
improvements and additions to its hotel
properties, the book-value of freeholds
and plant rising as a result by £545,632.
Further alterations and improvements
are intended in the current term, but,
says chairman G. Cohen, these will be
limited because of the present high level
of building-costs. The directors’ report
bitterly condemns the vast sum paid-out
in the form of excise, taxes and other
duties. Last year the amount contributed
to public funds was £7,929,873, equal to
22.9 times the figure shareholders received
in dividends.

moderate but steady expansion:

Because quick turnover is essential in
the beer business, general concepts of
working-capital do not apply. Neverthe-
less, it is interesting to note the big
increases in bank-accommodation, up
£254,238 to £748,736, and creditors,
higher by £98,156 at £328,410. Tax pro-
vision was lower at £467,212 (down
£160,978) and debtors rose £71,650 to
£480,122.
The end of the term saw the 13,692,832

tangible assets of 9s. lOd. on consolidated
book-values, and last week the scrip sold

the 6 p.c. 20s. prefs. was £135 15s.
Bankers and Traders* Insurance Co.
T atest of the fire-, accident- and
marine-offices to venture into the
life field, Bankers and Traders’ knocked-
up a record net profit last term before
announcing that it would share with its
original sponsors, Queensland Insurance
and Burns, Philp and Co., in the owner-
ship of the Equitable Probate and
General Insurance Co.
Queensland Insurance outbid the U.K.
Royal-Globe group early this year for
the £111,317 paid capital of the Equit-
able, which, at present, writes life and
some general business in Queensland (its
home-State), N.S.W., Victoria, South
Aust. and Tasmania. Bankers and
Traders’ has purchased an undisclosed
but “substantial” interest in the life-co.,
now to be known as Equitable Life and
General Insurance Co.
Represented by underwriting- or
settling-agents in many parts of the
world, the Sydney-controlled Bankers
and Traders’ has three branches in South
and East Africa and a U.K. office in
addition to its Australia-wide string of
29 branches and sub-branches.
Spurred-on by the expansion of the
'Co.’s operations, as well as by inflation,
net premium income has doubled over

during this period taking the
all-ord. paid capital to £375,000.

increased the amount paid-up

In common with other
accident offices Bankers and
Traders’ has, in recent years,
found difficulty in winning
satisfactory profits from over-
seas operations, and “dis-
appointing” results are reported
from the South African
branches established after the
withdrawal from India and
Pakistan in 1954-55.
This hasn’t prevented the
co. from giving a very good
account of itself over the last
couple of years. But, together
with the intense competition
developing in the local sphere
as life-offices, h.-p. offshoots
and overseas underwriters
move into the fire-and-acci-
dent market, it has contributed
to the retaliatory spread of
established insurance cos. into
life-assurance and various other
activities. Australian business
was responsible for the im-
provement in last term’s earn-
ings—the highest in the co.’s
38 years as an underwriter--
and for most of the £84,463
increase in net premiums:

experience of the various de-

the overall gain was more than
sufficient to offset a small (4s.

On average share-capital the
earnings represented a return
of 34.6 p.c. (13.5 p.c. under-
writing, 21.1 p.c. investments)
compared with 27.8 p.c. in
1958 and 21, 28.5 and 25.3 p.c.
back to 1955. The div.-rate was
unchanged at 12| p.c., to give
the eleventh successive dis-
tribution on this scale, invest-

by £19,223 the £46,875 needed

being placed, once again, on
higher-yielding shares, deben-
tures and unsecured notes.
Since the end of the 1956 term
the amount invested in shares,

24.7 p.c. of all assets, £237,077

Titanium Minerals, Lt<l.
Tn view of the prolonged
slump in rutile prices,
N.S.W. beach-miner Titanium
Minerals, Ltd., has suspended
the production of heavy
minerals at Jerusalem Creek
and Cement Head.
This move will not affect the
co.’s forward contracts for the
supply of rutile, stocks of
rutile on -hand at June 30 last
being adequate to cover sales
until the end of this year.
As is only to be expected,
the date of 'resumption and
scale of operations contem-
plated “must depend, to some
degree, on rutile-zircon prices
offering at the beginning of
1960.” At the same time,
improvements in mining and
metallurgical practices are being
considered as a means of
reducing production costs,
while zircon marketing is also
being “carefully studied” as a
supplementary source of in-
come.
Wyong Minerals, Ltd.
TTndaunted by the difficulties
encountered by Titanium
Minerals and many other
beach - miners, the newly-
formed Wyong Minerals, Ltd.,
it is understood, expects to
earn its keep in depressed
rutile- and zircon-markets by
virtue of low production-costs.
Nevertheless, the prospectus, to
be issued later this week, will
be carefully scanned, no doubt,
for details of estimated work-
ing - costs, royalty - payments,
etc.
Underwriting the issue in
conjunction with the Sydney
’broking-firm, Charles A. Ord
and Minnett, Commonwealth
Mining Investments (Aus-
tralia), Ltd., has arranged for
870,900 ss. shares in Wyong
Minerals to be offered to share-
holders on the books of Com-
monwealth Mining, at July 8
last, in the proportion of one
Wyong (55.) share for every 10
(10s.) units in Commonwealth
Mining.

From Herbert Holman
“You folks are lucky to live
-*• in England and to be so
near to all this,” said the
American on the day-excur-
sion from Salzburg to the Salz-
kammergut. “It’s quite a
stretch for us, in terms of
money as well as distance, and
it can’t happen more than once
every seven years or so.” He
was a youngish man who was
in the middle of a seven-week
tour introducing his wife to
the Europe he had traversed
as a soldier.
The reaction that this proxi-
mity was not always considered
a blessing was quickly re-
pressed as being unkind and
out-of-date. For his mildly
envious remark was true. Tour-
ing Europe makes a delightful
holiday, with complete changes
of scene and all the romantic
novelties and contrasts of
foreign countries.
Not least interesting is the
practical side of this vast,
expanding tourist industry.
Most Americans have to make
their arrangements six months
in advance. Their tours vary
between the lightning grand
(e.g., a month’s air-travel, New
York Paris Copenhagen
Munich Vienna
Venice Florence —Rome
Geneva London New
York) and the casual local
(six weeks in Southern Ger-
many, Austria and Northern
Italy). And it is now possible
for an American to buy a 60-
day first-class railway season-
ticket for travel in most Euro-
pean countries for as little as
$l2O.
The lightning grand-tour is
exciting but wearing. Three
Americans who shared am-
iable at a Munich beer-hall
offering an “Alpine Night”
were both amazed and envious
because we hadn’t decided
where we were going. Their
schedule was very packed, and
the longest they stayed in any
one place was four days in
Florence.
These are mainly individual
contracts. In July and August
there is hardly a square-metre
of accommodation unclaimed.
The hotels and pensions are
fully taken-up with travel-
agency bookings, while private-
houses, cottages, schools and
even empty halls are requisi-
tioned to cope with the essenti-
ally low-priced “cultural”
party-tours from high-schools,
churches and similar bodies on
both sides of the Atlantic.
All except the young, the
hardy and the unsophisticated
are well advised to avoid this
period.
Special Terms
There wouldn’t seem to be
much point in taking a holiday
and not having enough to eat.
This, nevertheless, happens
more often than not and is an
extension of the old financial
maxim that most things are as
good as their price. When
food was cheap, locally pro-
duced and plentiful, the
boarder who was inadequately
fed had a grievance. Now food
is dear and, even in country
districts, imported. So its
quality is closely related to the
price paid.
“We have special food for
our pensioners idiomatically
remarked the hotelier &t
Berchtesgaden. His meaning
of the word “special” was
pejorative rather than selective.
But at least he was honest. (It
is by no means uncommon for
en pension guests to be segre-
gated in one room while a la
carte customers are served in
another.) Since his hotel was
fairly expensive he gave better-
than-average value, but the
portions were smallish and only
moderately sustaining. The
underlying reason, of course,
is the need to quote competitive
terms and not to dismay the
intending traveller.
Another misleading device is
the service-charge. In the
better hotels this seems to have
worked its way up from 10,
through 12{, to a more-or-less
uniform 15 per cent. Thus,
a week’s board for two at the
advertised equivalent of £A2O
per person will probably be
grossed-up as follows:
Board ’. .. £4O 0 0
Wine .. .... '.. 5 0 0
£45 0 0
15 p.c. service .. . . 6 15 0
10 p.c. tax on wine .. 10 0
£52 5 0
With baths, local taxes,
drinks at other than meal-
times and extra tips, the basic
£2O can soon approach £3O!
There is a simple way of
evading this art of grossing-
up which is developing into
the tourist industry’s concealed
reserve. It is to find a modest
hotel for bed-and-breakfast
only and to ,take other meals
out (the service-charge in
restaurants is still 10 per cent.)
Lunch can be a snack and
dinner quite substantial. One
can dine just as well, better
perhaps, and have money over
for excursions and purchases.
But freelance travel is not
cheap. After paying the return-
fare to the starting-point, a
daily outlay of about £4 per
person is needed for an un-
stinted holiday.
That Man Again
The lovely province of
Bavaria has unfortunate and
self-conscious associations with
the rise and practices of the
Nazis. In Munich, the original
Biirgerbraukeller where the
plot was hatched is a shabby
ruin. Dachau, described in pre-
war Baedeker as “an old
market-village and a great
resort of landscape-painters,”
is an outer suburb that does not
appear on the excursion-boards.
Berchtesgaden, as everybody
knows, was Hitler’s own. This
is a particularly unhappy curse,
for it is a delightful centre
with many surrounding beauty-
spots more interesting in them-
selves than the deflowered
Obersalzberg.
This broad pyramid is one
association with the Third
Reich that it has been quite im-
possible to delete, as it were,
from the records. Hitler lived
there for 15 years, spent nearly
1000-million marks on its
development and constructed
the notorious “Eagle’s Nest”
at the Kehlstein summit. This
latter survived the daring
R.A.F. raid on April 25, 1945,
when the S.S. barracks and the
establishments of Hitler,
Goebbels, Goring and Bor-
mann were destroyed or
damaged. Later, the remnants
of the Berghof, Hitler’s house,
were blasted by the Federal
Government.
Kehlstein, wisely left intact,
has now reverted to its original
peaceable function as a view-
point, but with the difference
that the former whole day’s
mountaineering is now an easy

Red Andys Gift
By
MARGARET
TRIST
< (-rv ed Andy has the
|-c second sight!” was
JLY what people said
when Andy Flana-
gan’s name was
anywhere along the Ha\yk€s-
bury River, or on its" tribu-
taries, particularly the Mac-
Donald, where his house and
.smithy were situated eight
miles above the junction with
the main river.
He was known as Red
Andy, because a§ a young man
his hair and beard had been
flaming red. But in 1848 his
beard and hair were white,
which made no difference to
his being called Red Andy,
just as when some of the pro-
ductions of his second sight
proved otherwise, it made no
difference to the story which
lingered afterwards.
One of his. most remarkable
feats of second sight con-
cerned Miss Piggins, an Eng-
lishwoman, who had come to
the colony with her father,
who had died leaving her
stranded in Windsor. To eke
out her finances, and to be able
to return periodically to her
father’s grave, not liking to
leave him alone too long in
such a strange country, Miss
Piggins set sail in boats upon
the river, visiting one place
then another.
Miss Piggins’s services were
varied. They included help in
childbirth and laying-out,
though a natural timidity, a
lack of willingness to come to
grips with life, didn’t make her
much good at either. She was
available, also, to take a girl
to Windsor for “the season” in
the hope of a good marriage,
but as most river girls were
capable of making a marriage,
good or otherwise, for them-
selves early in life, and as no
one was sure when the season
in Windsor was, this highlight
had occurred only once or
twice. The river people
accepted her as they accepted
any other phenomenon.
Miss Piggins sat in the prow
of the storeboat, the March
sun striking between her
shoulderblades. The river
flowed past. She scarcely saw
it. She had no need ; it was
etched against her eyelids and
she saw it plainly each night as
she tried to sleep. Life had
become for her a flowing river
with nowhere on its banks that
she might come to rest. Miss
Piggins, tall and thin, with
sharp shoulders and elbows
and knees which made angles
under her brown cloak, a brown
straw-bonnet trimmed with a
bird-of-paradise and a full-
blown red rose, carried a flat
straw-bag, which contained all
her belongings and which she
held with her gloved hands
against her stomach.
Not y£t thirty, exposure to
the weather had lined her face
and turned the flesh on the tip
of her long nose and her high
cheekbones to reddish-purple.
Miss Piggins kept her own
counsel. If the crew paid her
as little regard as the sacks of
potatoes on which she sat, it
was all the same to Miss
Piggins. '
HThe crew in the stern took
turns at the tiller, spat in
the water, and spoke in low
tones so That One wouldn’t
hear. It seemed to the crew
that That One was always with
them. Not only was she poor
company in herself, but she
prevented them enjoying the
pastimes they had invented to
while away the hours on the
river. The crew didn’t dislike
Miss Piggins. They didn’t dis-
like anyone. But they knew
they were offensive to her. It
hurt and troubled them and so
subdued them, taking the
pleasure from the sunshine, the
bright blue of the water, the
drifting trees and rocks.
The crew comprised Jeddy
Blake, Salting Joe and Single-
ton’s Bill, Horry’s Ben from
downalong having been left at
the Bullock Wharf with a face-
ache. It took four to man the
oars of the storeboat, but
given good weather and a
following wind to belly-out the
sail, they could manage with-
out oars. If they became stuck
on a sandbank or were be-
calmed too long they could
send messages by devious
means to Horry's Ben, who
would then tax his ingenuity,
and join them by ways as
devious as the messages.
“Did she say where** she
w 7 ants to be took?” asked
Jeddy, scratching the mat of
dark hair on his chest through
a rent in his shirt.
“No,” said Bill.
“The trouble is she don’t
have nowhere to go,” said Joe
who, as the Skipper, had the
responsibility of cargo and
passengers.
“Wish she’d stop going then.
Where we headin’? Upalong
or downalong?”
“Depends.”
The crew and Miss Piggins,
coming down the MacDonald,
were all going nowhere in
particular. This was in the best
traditions of the river, and the
crew would have enjoyed it
only for Miss Piggins.
They came out of the Mac-
Donald and looked wistfully
towards The Branch, a town-
ship of small houses and a
large inn. Without Miss
Piggins they would have had
a royal morning at the inn.
They were too polite to leave
a woman sitting in the boat
while they enjoyed themselves.
Goods to deliver would have
made it all right, but by no
stretch of imagination could
the sacks of potatoes be said to
belong to The Branch. They
had been from Dwyers, a mile
below the Bullock Wharf, for
the store at the Bullock Wharf,


but accidentally brought away
again. The crew were honest.
Besides, if they had had an
excuse to visit the inn, the
morning’s pleasure would have
been soured, by coming back
to Piggins’s long face and her
“I am not one to object to a
gentleman taking a little some-
thing.” And Miss Piggins
would not go near The
Branch. She was scary of
ghosts even in broad daylight.
The Branch had the most
numerous and most solid
ghosts of the whole river.
“We could go to Lancaster’s
and pick up the mellings,”
suggested Jeddy.
“Three-four weeks back Tim
wanted the mellings took.
Could be gone be now,” said
Bill.
Joe thought this over. “Aw,
think not,” he said at last
“Tim easy-like and mellings
keep.”
The tide was still coming in,
so they headed towards Lan-
caster’s, which was upalong not
very much from The Branch. .
Tn the prow Miss Piggins had
A her own thoughts, not
cheerful ones. Despite the
sunshine, the glittering river
waters, life had a grey look.
In the past week she had been
at Dwyer’s, Flanagan’s, Come
Recent Boyles’s and Boyles’s
Proper. And not a morsel of
comfort at any of them. No
welcome, no sense of home-
coming. That was what Miss
Piggins wanted. To go home
and be welcomed.
But where, where was home?
Her own room and a bed to
which she could grow accus-
tomed. It must be somewhere.
Not even her Papa had wel-
comed her last time she had
been in Windsor. Sitting by
his grave, waiting to be in
touch with him, to tell him of
her troubles on her last trip on
the river, he had growled
suddenly, “Let me be in peace,
girl. Stop fidgeting. Go away.”
This had frightened Miss
Piggins. She had hurried away
and since then had had no
sense of repose at all. Besides,
she had lost the brightness
necessary for visiting. She had
felt like a ghost herself,
wandering in other people’s
houses.
They went in at Lancaster’s,
the landing made of floating
oildrums, hard to keep steady
by. The boat jiggered up and
down, so Miss Piggins had to
hold on, mild nausea recalling
the unfortunate trip from Old
England, a trip which should
never have been undertaken
by herself and Papa. Where
had it led them? Papa to his
grave at Windsor, content lo
stay there, it appeared—oh,
Papa’s lack of ambition had
always been his downfall!
• —herself to floating endlessly
on a river.
The crew hollered hopefully.
Up through the trees the little
grey shack could be seen. They
hollered at intervals till Tim
Lancaster appeared in the door-
way. He came slowly down
through the trees, barefooted,
hitching at his trousers, which
were rolled to the knees, his
thatch of straw-colored hair
with its kinky waves like a wig
against his broad, ruddy face.
“Been taking a nap; wad
you want?”
“They mellings, Tim. We
come to take the mellingsr”
Tim shook his head. “Et-up.
Seven lads and a crop of
mellings don't go fur. Me lads
can’t be kept out of mellings.”
“Pity. We'd have took ’em
along for you. Fetchin’ a good
price, mellings.”
“Oh, ay, they be, but yer
can’t get the damned things to
market. Too fur, here, from
anywheres. Dunno how I
come to settle in just this spot.”
“It’s purty, Tim.”
“Sure it is,” said Tim,
brightening. “Me and Missis
like it. But purtiness don’t
make a living, Joe.”
“That’s a fact.”
“Come up and take a pan-
nikin. Missis’ll be pleased.
Dead asleep she was, but fire’s
going.”
The crew looked at their
passenger, who rose resignedly.
“If it's not Piggins herself!”
Tim gave her a hand up onto
the uneasy oildrums. “You
come to pay a visit?”
“No; I’m going further,”
replied Miss Piggins hastily.
The Lancasters didn’t lack
hospitality, but a straw-filled
mattress, on a dirt floor was not
to Miss Piggins’s liking; nor
Mrs. Tim's offer of a share of
the double bed “t’other side of
me.”
On the path something
whizzed past Miss Piggins’s
bonnet and she jumped back.
“Take no notice,” Tim said
kindly. “Only they lads and
they muskets! Hi lads, fire
t’other way. Piggins here and
scared like.”
T ancaster’s home was of
- L/ two rooms built of slabs,
with a thatched roof. The
front room had in it the
double-bed and the walls were
covered with garments hang-
ing from nails. Behind was the
kitchen, furnished with the
boys’ mattresses, a plank table,
stools and boxes.
Mrs. Tim heaved her bulk
hurriedly from one of the
mattresses,, smoothed hastily
the corn-colored ringlets
bunched about her ears, and
went to the fireplace to remove
a loaf from the ashes. She held
it expertly with the tips of her
fingers, and flung it smoking-
hot onto the table.
“Sit down, please do;
kettle’s on bile and brew won’t
take a minute. You staying
long, Piggins?’’
“No ; I go on with the boat,”
said Miss Piggins firmly.
“Ah, well, ’nother time. We
do aim to be haiving another
room. They lads got big
sudden and crowded us out.
But then, what’s the use! Daisy
and Violet already be courting,
so soon down to Rosie they’ll
wed! Ah, Piggins dear, the
babe is hardly laid at your
breast before he's in another
woman’s arms. ’Tisn’t much
sense life has.”
Mrs. Tim sighed and her
blue eyes darkened with tears.
She loved children and she
loved flowers, and the boys
were well grown before a pass-
ing priest pointed out her error
in nomenclature and redubbed
Mrs. Tim’s darlings Stanislaus
and Xavier and suchlike names
she couldn’t get her tongue
round. Besides, she couldn’t
believe that all flowers were
girls. Or that it mattered.
The boys came in and stood
their muskets in a row along
the wall. The tea was made,
the pannikins filled, the loaf
broken apart. The crew and
the Lancasters all talked to-
gether, the best way with com-
pany, listening being for the
lonely hours ahead when the
mind would unfold the tone of
a voice and words seemingly
lost. The loaf finished, Mrs.
Tim brought out cold meat
and potatoes. Then the remains
of a suet dumpling. Her face
grew redder and redder in an
excess of hospitality.
But at midday the food was
gone and there was nothing
else offering.
“We’ll get along,” said Joe.

WRITER AND READER
Please take my word for it, this is no one
particular person but is in fact a composite
personality. For want of a better
word he is known as a “writer,” he writes books
about people, by which one may assume he also reads
people. And you, reader, read the
books he writes, by which one may assume you
either do not read people or you read them
cursorily ... in other words, you “skip.” Fie is known
as “difficult,” which is a way of saying
that he is not always what you might call
“with you,” and with you may behave
brusquely, even rudely. But, please, withhold
judgment, read him patiently, for this man
is a “writer” and his mind is probably
elsewhere. / swear, this is no one particular
person. But you know him —he reads
people, reads you and me penet-
ratingly. You may be amazed and horrified to
find what he has read in you, extracted from your
book which he has skilfully thumbed through, reading
chapter-headings, looking for things you wouldn’t
consider looking for I mean style, punctuation, general
plan, format, execution. Yes, it is a sort of
“execution” because this writer who is necessarily also a
reader of people writes books for you who
read people cursorily. Please
take my word for it he sees no one
particular person but creates a composite
personality in his imagination, using as material
a minimum of fact, but those facts may be
pretty devastating to your
self-esteem. May I suggest we ,
take lessons from him in
reading people because the effect may be to
make you impatient of reading
books only and prefer to develop the art of
reading people, who are far more interesting than
books anyway and are the only reason why you read
books anyway.

THE VIC PATRICK STORY
From Fighter to Ref.
By RAY MITCHELL
A lad named Victor Lucca
stood outside Ernie Mc-
Quillan’s gymnasium in King
Street, Newtown (Sydney),
trying to pluck up courage to
go in.
He watched a couple of lads
go in, each carrying a kitbag.
He still stood.
Then he heard a voice:
“Why don’t you go in, son?”
Young Lucca turned around
and saw Ron Richards smiling
at him.
“Yes, I will. I was just
wondering if I had time today.
I’ve got to go a message.”
Ron grinned and pushed the
lad ahead of him. Young
Lucca felt proud as he mounted
the dark stairs, with the great
Richards behind him. As he
climbed higher he heard the
scuff, scuff of the skipping-
rope, the thump of glove meet-
ing leather bag.
Then young Lucca was in the
gym. He saw two lifesize
photos at the far end. Jack
Carroll and Barney Ross. He
slowly turned his head so he
could see around the walls. It
seemed to him there was
scarcely enough space left to
hang another photo. He saw a
couple of sweating lads on
the floor doing ground exer-
cises ; saw the skipping, a
couple in headguards swapping
punches in the ring, and a few
doing shadow-sparring.
Then, “Time! ” Everything
suddenly quiet—except for the
labored breathing of the lads
who had just completed a
round or two, and the soft
instructions given by trainers
to the boys as they wiped-down
their charges with towels.
“You trainin’ today?”
Ernie McQuillan, addressing a
dusky youth who has walked
in.
“Naw, not today. Termorrer,
maybe.”
“You can’t win fights unless
you’re fit, son,” says Ernie.
Young Lucca watched them
all train. He stayed and
watched his idol, Ron Richards,
and he was among the last to
leave. In fact, he was the
only one left and was looking
at the photos when McQuillan
came up to him.
“Want to be a fighter, son?”
“Yes,” answered the lad.
“I’d like to give it a go.”
“Five-bob a week and come
in tomorrow and we’ll put you
through. What’s your name?”
“Victor Lucca, sir.”
“H’m. 0.K., see you to-
morrow.”
So the kid came in and
punched the bag a bit, had a
go at the speed-ball and found
he could hit it only once —
when it was stationary. No
one seemed to take much notice
of him for several days. Then
one of the trainers asked him
to hop into the ring to spar
with one of his boxers. Young
Lucca agreed, but after one
round he was sent out of the
ring.
“Your style is too awkward,
"He can have the ten-thousand quid—I'm not THAT
hungry for dough ”
son, and you know nothing
about boxing.”
“I’ve never been taught,”
answered Lucca.
A few days later a trainer
called Lucca to him. “Shape-
up, son. No, not like that.
Gosh, nobody fights like
that! Shape-up left foot
forward and left hand out.
That’s right. Now, hit my hand
with a straight left. No,
straight —not bent! Hit it, will
you! Here, get on the bag.
I’ll hold it while you hit it.
Just hit it as you want to
hit it, and I’ll take you on
from there ”
Lucca shaped-up as he
wanted to. The trainer sighed,
and there were a couple of
giggles. Lucca had his right
foot forward ; he was leaning
back with his weight on his
left foot; his chin was tucked
into his shoulder and he was
peering, side-on, over an
extended right arm, at the bag
Suddenly he lashed out with
his left from way back. The
trainer, holding the bag, rocked
back on his heels. “Holy
mackerel! Who put the mule’s
kick in your left, son?”
Lucca grinned. He felt
better, and he whaled away at
the bag for three minutes before
the trainer told him enough for
the day.
This went on day after day
for about three weeks. The
trainer coached the boy;
he did not try to change his
style—just taught him how to
punch and block from his
natural style.
“You’re wasting your time
with that kid,” said another
trainer. “He’s a southpaw, and
southpaws wouldn’t draw
breath in the Stadium. Any-
how, he’s even unorthodox for
a southpaw. He’s the most
awkward-looking fighter I’ve
ever seen. No one would pay
to see him.”
“He can hit,” said the tutor.
“Yeah, but what else?” And
the second trainer walked away
to check the clock . . .
Some weeks later young
Lucca was sitting in a gutter
playing cards. It was getting
dusk.
“Hey, young Lucca,” yelled
a voice, “you wanta fight?”
“Where?”
“Carlton, tonight. Fit?”
“Yes, I’m fit. How far?”
“Four rounds. Grab your
togs and come with me.”
In the dressing-room at
Carlton: “What’s your fighter’s
name?” asked the clerk.
“Edwards. Alf Edwards.”
“Alf Edwards. 0.K., you’re
on fight after next.” ,
“Why the Edwards?” asked
Lucca.
“Couldn’t think of your first
name, son.”
So Alf Edwards walked
down the aisle to face his first
opponent in the ring. He felt
strangely elated. He was keyed-
up. This was it ; this was his
first fight in a proper ring.
He stepped through the
ropes and sat down. He wasn't
nervous, particularly, but, he
had that feeling of unreality.
He looked across the ring. The
other kid was young, too. His
name was Les Shocker . . .
While the gloves were being
laced on his hands he looked
around the stadium. It was
small and there weren’t many
people there. He heard some-
one say: “This is a new . kid.
Alf Edwards. Don’t think he’s
had a fight before. Shocker
will test him. He can hit, that
kid.”
“Ready, young Lucca?”
whispered the trainer, and the
pair of them walked towards
the centre of the ring to
receive instructions from the
referee. The two momentarily
appraised each other. The ref.
said some words about hitting
cleanly at all times, breaking
when “I tell you to”; no
hitting on the break. “Protect
yourself at all times. Now
shake hands and come out
fighting!”
Gloved hands touched ; the
two boys looked at each other,
square in the eyes, and Lucca
smiled.
Back to their corners, and
a whispered command from
each second; then the bell,
and both boxers moved out.
There was a titter from the
crowd. “Look at this cLab,”
said one. “Edwards moves like
a crab. Crikey, fancy putting
him in the ring!”

Shocker scored with a left,
then moved around. He tried
another left. It fell short. He
plainly was puzzled by the
southpaw’s stance. He moved
to his left and tried a right.
It landed. He tried again—
and the roof fell on him!
That wrapped it up for the
night. Edwards had let go a
left hook, -and the fight was
over in the first round . . .
“I tell you, Ernie, this kid'
is good. He hits like Sid
Godfrey, only he’s the other
way around —a southpaw.”
“0.K., you look after him
and let me know when he’s
ready for another fight.”
It was four months before
Lucca fought again, and this
time he didn’t fight as Alf
Edwards. He won by a knock-
out in the third round. He had
14 more fights during the year
and only one man went the
distance with him. By now
every fight fan was talking
about him. He’d brought
forward his second name and
made it his last name ; he was
fighting as “Vic Patrick.”
Ernie McQuillan was now
telling everyone who would
listen that he had the next
lightweight champion of Aus-
tralia. And most people
believed him.
“Can he get up off the floor
and fight back? That’s the true
test of a champion,” said one.
“He did against Henry Cars-
burg, didn't he?” answered
Ernie. “And what did he do to
Carsburg? He knocked him
out!”
“Yeah, that’s right.”
Vic was fighting main
events by now. He was draw-
ing the crowds and puzzling the
experts.
“Never heard of a southpaw
being so popular.”
“But this one can hit.”
“Yeah, the crowd likes a
hitter, but there’s more to it
than that. This kid has color.”
That was it. Vic Patrick had
color. He had it to the /7th
degree. There was a magnetic
something about the kid which
drew crowds.
He flattened Harry Summers
in one round, then he stopped
brilliant Joe Hall in five.
Crowds piled in to see the
awkward southpaw in action.
Kid Delaney went out in a
round, and fight fans realised
that every time they paid to
see Vic Patrick in action they
would get short thrills for their
money and an early night
home.
Jack Rigby went out in
four; Addi Poli was finished
in two. That was when they
lined-up old Tod Morgan for
the Australian lightweight
title. Tod was the champ., and
he had been around a long
time. He was cagey, and knew
just how to deal with fresh
young kids.
They tangled on June 5,
1941, at Sydney Stadium and
the old master tied young Vic
in knots.
“I learned more from
Morgan than I did from every-
one else put together,” Vic
said years later.
But Vic found the target in
the fifth round, and down
went Morgan. Vic stepped
back while referee Joe Wallis
began the count. Anxiety
caused him to come closer to
his fallen foe and he hovered
right over him.
Morgan read the eagerness in
the kid’s eyes and took his
knee off the canvas. As Patrick
saw him rise, he rushed in,
impetuously, and threw a
punch. Morgan dropped his
knee before the blow landed,
and Wallis had to disqualify
Patrick.
It was a bitter pill. But he
got his revenge. One month
later he took the title by a
points decision, but it was one
of the few occasions Vic heard
hoots addressed to him. Many
fans thought Morgan should
have gained the verdict.
Vic had knockout victories
over Len Fay and Jimmy
Dundee; then met Morgan
again. This time there was no
doubt about it: Vic on points,
very convincingly. He was to
meet old Tod a fourth time—
in 1942 —and Vic stopped him
in eleven rounds.
Patrick now packed Sydney
Stadium almost every time he
fought there. Stadiums, Ltd.,

Pipe o’ Peace?
By ERIC BEDFORD
Most of our habits and
lesser vices are the
. result of imitation.
Over forty years ago,
probably fifty, I unconsciously
set-out to emulate my father’s
smoking-habits with his odd
variety of pipes hanging in the
pipe-racks around his study
and one always hanging below
his nether lip whilst a parrot
sat on his shoulder or scrim-
maged with the papers on his
desk.
His small study, looking on
the garden, was invariably
smoke-filled. He was like a
steam-train exiting from the
Simplon tunnel when he rose
and came to the French-
windows to look at the sky or
spit in the general direction of
all “wowsers.”
Being a didactic parent, he
would say to his assembled
boys: “Don’t go smoking
those effeminate cigarettes in
the lavatory and burn the
bloody place down. If you want
to smoke, here, take the only
smoke worth while, a pipe”—
and he would thrust a new
corncob pipe, which he got by
the gross from America, into
one of our mouths, and shoo
us off like so many quail eager
for the wing, so that he could
plunge his pen into the ink
again and write with a fervor
that suggested he had only a
few hours to live and the tale
must be told.
enough, all the
- boys became pipe-smokers,
and a pipe is hanging below
my lower lip as I write. The
important point about all this
is that, learning to smoke pipes
as boys, we never inhaled
tobacco into our lungs. Since
I W'as a boy the cigarette has
almost totally taken the place
of the pipe, and as practically
all cigarette-smokers inhale the
smoke into their lungs they
are now gett’ng puckered brows
over the incidence of lung-
cancer.
The incidence of lung-
troubles from smoking is said
to be much lower amongst
pipe-smokers. Many a casual
acquaintance casts his eye
upon my pipe, and says: “A
pipe looks good. I have a
cough . . . but . .
That starts me off on my dis-
sertation on “smoker’s cough”
and how to avoid it. But
before we go into why pipe-
smoking is the lesser evil, let
us get the background of
tobacco itself.
The Nicotiana species of
plants belong to the Solanacea
or nightshade family, from
which Atropa, a vegetable
alkaloid found in the deadly-
nightshade (Atropa belladonna)
is extracted by adding sul-
phuric acid. That fact seems
“Ay feminine tricks and guile prevailed, darling, and at
last we're married .”
irrelevant, but has a particu-
larly interesting angle later.
The term tobacco w ! as, some
writers assert, used by the
Carribees to designate the
pipe in which they smoked it,
the name later being trans-
ferred by the Spaniards to the
herb itself. Others say it got its
name from Tabaca in St.
Domingo, from where it was
introduced into Europe by a
Spanish grandee. Later, Jean
Nicot, French courtier and
writer, w j as sent by Francis II
as Ambassador to Portugal. He
brought tobacco back which
was called Nicotiana as a com-
pliment to his having imported
the weed. It was used by
Catherine de Medici and others
in the form of powder.
It w j as some time after the
use of tobacco as snuff that the
smoking of it began. Very
shortly following its appearance
in Europe tobacco was pro-
hibited in England and many
, other parts of the Old World.
Physicians declared it harmful
to health, priests denounced it
as sinful. Pope Urban VIII
issued a bull excommunicat-
ing all persons found taking
snuff’ whilst in church, Sultan
Amarath chopped-off the heads
of people caught smoking, and
your nose was cut-off if you
were discovered smoking in
Russia.
T”ngland's James I raised the
duty on the weed from 2d.
to 6s. lOd. a pound without con-
sulting Parliament, and in his
“Counterblaste to Tobacco”
declared smoking* “loathsome
to the eye, hurtful to the nose,
harmful to the brain, dangerous
to the lungs, and in the black
stinking fume thereof nearest
resembling the horrible Stygian
smoke of the pit that is
bottomless.”
Nicotine, a volatile alkaloid,
occurs in tobacco in combina-
tion wfith malic and citric acids;
it is a deadly poison, but only
an infinitesimal amount of
nicotine is carried away in
smoke. Whilst all smoking is
to some degree injurious to
health, by far the worst effects
of smoking are felt when the
smoker continually inhales the
smoke into his or her lungs.
Practically all cigarette-
smokers inhale continuously.
Nearly all pipe-smokers who
have been reared on the pipe,
so to speak, don't inhale at
all. Whilst pipe-smokers do
minimise their oxygen-intake
and absorb a trifling amount
of nicotine and tobacco-tar,
the results are usually more
noticed in the staining of their
teeth than in the invisible stain-
ing and irritating of their
lungs.
Another tremendous and
vital difference in cigarette- a 9
against pipe-smoking is the
smoking of cigarette-paper.
Papers go through a caustic-
soda or sulphuric-acid process
in their manufacture. You will
remember that Atropa, a
vegetable alkaloid found in
the deadly - nightshade, is
extracted by using sulphuric
acid. There, we trust, the
similarity ends. But the fact
that paper goes through an
alkali or acid process may con-
tribute consderably to the bad
effects of cigarette-smoking.
TJecause of these factors there
cannot be any doubt that
a non-inhaling pipe-smoker is
running less danger than when
using what my father called
“the effeminate cigarette.”
The excuses of people who
don't, won't, or can't smoke
pipes are as follows: (1) “I
don’t like 'em” ; (2) “My teeth
won't hold a pipe" ; (3) “Can t
get any satisfact on out of a
pipe”; and. (4) (usually a
secret excuse): “They look
old-fashioned.'’
Yes, ladies, men are just as
weak slaves to fashion as you
are. Pipes are supposed to
indicate an age-group, middle-
aged to oldish. Millions of
women smoke cigarettes, some
smoke cigars, but even the
small, decorated women's pipes
are a little too suggestive of
long pants instead of short
ones.
Personally, I think cigarettes
are a lazy habit. To smoke a
pipe properly there is con-
siderable preparation of pipes
and tobacco, a ritual which

Doomben
The luck o’ the game was
never'better illustrated than it
was in Queenslander Earl-
wood’s splendid win in last
Saturday’s Doomben Cup. His
owner, W. J. Jones, offered Lhe
colt at auction at the Bris-
bane yearling-sales in March,
1957, but the highest bid —
150gns. didn’t reach the
Woodonga studmaster’s very
modest reserve. It was 50gns.
short, and a lucky man retained
his colt.
The Doomben Cup success
added £7OOO prizemoney to
that colt’s total of now nearly
£19,000 for 11 firsts from 25
starts, and a £2OO gold cup
went with Saturday’s win.
There should be many more
wins from Earlwood, too ; his
pedigree indicates that he will
stay any distance. A three-
year-old till the end of this
month, he’s Queensland-bred,
by Boxwood (imp.), a son of
Bois Roussel (English Derby),
and is from Honey Buzz
(sister to Buzalong, 1938 Caul-
field Cup winner), by The
Buzzard (imp.). On the dam’s
side the pedigree traces back
to Carbine.
• • • •
Earlwood’s owner, Bill
Jones, went into thoroughbred-
breeding in 1953. In 1956 he
bought Honey Buzz with a
foal at foot for 600gns. at the
dispersal sale of Queensland’s
famous old Lyndhurst Stud. It
was at Lyndhurst that The
Buzzard became Australia’s
greatest sire of stayers, with
winners of well over £350,000.
The foal at foot with Honey
Buzz was Earlwood (by Box-
wood), and he was reared at
Jones’s own stud ... So there
it is—you can be lucky, some-
times.
With such a fine breeding-
background Earlwood could
go on to gather a Caulfield
or Melbourne Cup. Certainly
he’s had a great three-year-old
season, with the Queensland
Guineas and Derby and the
B.A.T.C.’s Summer Cup also
in the bag. The colt’s blood-
lines also include Whittier
(Caulfield Cup twice), Accarak
(Australian Cup) and Ardglen
IQ.T.C. Derby and St. Leger).
His dam won a couple of
sprints at Albion Park.

today, returning to Sydney
on Friday, and altogether it
looks like being one of the
meetings of the year.

Also (as part of Queensland’s
centenary - year celebrations)
there’s to be a centenary race-
meeting at Dalby, the first
country town in the State ever
to stage a properly-conducted
race-meeting. The first meeting
there was held on July 27 and 28,
1859, conducted under the rules of
the North Australian Jockey Club.
The century of racing on the Downs
will be celebrated now with the
meeting on July 18, when some of
the best gallopers in Queensland
are due to run. Q.T.C. chairman
Dr. John Power will go up from
Brisbane to present the Cup. The
Dalby xacebook will take the form
of a brochure giving detailed his-
torical information about racing
thereabouts, a good deal of it
obtained from the Mitchell Library
by Miss Mary MacMillan (Bris-
bane), a sister of R. I. MacMillan,
president of the Dalby Benefit Race
Club.
All the races will carry historic
names, and, in addition to extra
prizemoney, perks such as free ser-
vices to well-known Downs sires
for approved mares. Among the
interesting race-names is the Bat-
talion Improvers Handicap, named
after the Dalby horse that many
judges regard as the greatest horse
produced in Queensland. Battalion
won his first race in a Shearers’
Hack at Rangers Bridge, Dalby, and
from there graduated through the
classes to such successes as the
Queensland Cup and the Brisbane
Cup in 1897, when he carried 10.3.
Battalion died when contesting the
Grand National in England.

Flemington
The strangest feature of
Irish Sun’s Grand National
Steeple win last Saturday was
that he did not start favorite!
Trainer Harry Myers made no
secret of his belief that his
other charge, Redfield, was a
better National proposition
than Irish Sun, and many
punters followed the stable-
money which sent Redfield out
a 9-to-4 favorite in the race.
Irish Sun started at 7 to 2,
after longer odds had been
bet.
• • • •
On form, how'ever, the
courageous little grey looked
the National winner ; in fact,
this page described him last
week as next-best to a certainty.
He duly won by a comfortable
lengths, and his time, 5.58 J-,
cut 3isec. off Victory March’s
record, set in 1943. But it was
not till the final half-furlong
that Irish Sun’s supporters
breathed freely. Tranquil
Glow cleared-out with an early
lead that stretched to 25
lengths at the halfway mark,
and the Helios gelding still led
over the last fence. From
there Irish Sun’s stamina and
Brian Smith’s vigorous riding
gradually wore down the run-
away. Count Con finished
third, six lengths behind Tran-
quil Glow.
• • • •
Until he won a steeple at Caul-
field a couple of months ago at
66 to 1 Irish Sun was a maiden,
but he has now won four times
over the fences, and has proved the
outstanding fencer of the season.
He is a five-y.ear-old grey gelding
by Solar Bear (whose stock jump
well) from Princess Agnes, and was
bred by his owner, J. Tehan. The
win gave trainer Harry Myers the
National double; he won the
Hurdle with Hillwood. For Brian
Smith, surprisingly, it was a first
National Steeple win! Ron Lindsay,
who had w'on the Hurdle on Hill-
wood, shared the trainer’s belief
that Redfield would win, and he
rode that gelding, who finished a
weary tenth.
• * • •
Connections of South
Australian ’chaser Malatea
scratched the aged Hunting-
dale gelding from the National
to take on the easier Footscray
Steeple, with happy results.
Malatea made a one-act affair
of the race to win by eight
lengths, and give Brian Smith
the fencing-double.
Brian Smith had a great National
week. On Hurdle day he won on
Asprey and Irish Sun; at the Hunt
Club meeting at the Valley last
Wednesday he scored in the Maiden
Hurdle on Billowing Sails; and he
rode the Steeple double last Satur-
day. With 10 wins, he again leads
the jumping-riders.
• • • •
After the running of the
Doutta Galla Hurdle the crowd
put-on one of the noisiest
demonstrations ever heard at
Headquarters, directed at
young I. Cluff, who rode the
warm favorite, Resotto (third).
As this writer saw the race,
it was a fatuous demonstration.
The lad did all he could to
get the best out of his mount,
but Resotto was obviously
feeling the strain of his ardu-
ous run in the National the
previous week. Add the facts
that Resotto was carrying 11.9
and that his preparation was
hampered by injury, and it
seems clear that the uproar
was nothing more than a belly-
ache from punters who have
not learned to lose graciously.
The Doutta Galla was won
by French Master, who de-
served his success after a run
of minor placings. He’s a five-
year-old (a good age for

It was a case of one run
too many for Maori Prince
last Saturday. He had won
three races in three weeks, but
in the 10-furlongs Byerley
Handicap he came up against
another good staying youngster
in Dhaulagiri, and was com-
fortably beaten.
• • • •
It was rather a coincidence that
both Dhaulagiri and Irish Sun
should win last Saturday. At Caul-
field a few weeks ago those two
broke their “ducks” in successive
races, to pay a record dividend on
the doubles-tote. Both have since
proved that the odds about them
that day—loo to 1 and 66 to 1—
were most extravagant. Maori
Prince and Dhaulagiri will spell
now, with the important spring
races as their target. Each has won
three of his last four races, and
their connections have reason to
believe that classic honors are not
beyond them.
The Byerley Handicap was marred
by a very bad smash. Six
horses piled-up in a spill at the
mile-post, and three of them —
Solarism, Dry Sands and Dawned
—were killed or had to be
destroyed. No rider was seriously
injured.
The Granville Handicap—a
mile race for three-year-olds—
was run in two heats, and race-
goers had no reason to com-
plain about the way form
worked-out. In winning the
first heat the Masthead-
Society Belle colt Society Beau
ran right up to his previous
effort, when he won in open
company in a Welter at Caul-
field. In that race he won
from the Resurgent-Loch Derg
gelding Fire Foam —and it was
Fire Foam who took the
second division of the Gran-
ville.
At Rosehill
In the absence of leading
Sydney riders —most of them
in Brisbane last Saturday —
apprentices scooped the pool
at Rosehill, winning all eight
events. H. Williams, attached
to the T. J. Smith stable, won
on Easter Fair and Top Ruler
for the stable. He could
develop into a first-class horse-
man ; he handled both horses
particularly well. He only
recently won his first race, at
Warwick Farm on Murchison.
K. Parkinson also won two
races at Rosehill, the other
four going to S. Farrawell,
K. Smith, A. Taylor and B.
Howlett.
Kaoru again turned on the
speed in the Rosehill Flying,
outclassing eight opponents.
It was her first success in open
company, and it won’t be her
last; she’s bred on speed lines,
and has come solid with racing.
A three-year-old filly, she’s by

mime by Ajax from Ajixa

the Kirkham Stakes, and in
some races equalled race-
record time. Brisbane trainer
Frank Kennedy paid 3000gns.
for the yearling brother to
Kaoru at the Randwick auc-
tion last year. Kaoru won as
a two-year-old at Hawkesbury
in 1958, and since early May
this year has been successful
three times in five starts. In
all starts this time up she has
been ridden by Canterbury
apprentice A. Taylor, who’s
attached to Charlie Munro’s
stables.
In four of her last five starts
two-year-old Lilmari has been
well fancied, but to date she
hasn’t won a race, and book-
makers must be finding her a
wonderful winner for them.
She goes fast on the track, but
in the Rosehill First Gradua-
tion Stakes for her age-group
she had every chance. The
winner was Grand Venture,
ridden by S. Farrawell, and
also successful at Hawkesbury
in June. New Zealand-bred
Swaraj, ridden by ex-Perth
jockey P. Knuckey and having
her first Australian start, was
a close second.
Two-year-old Quiet Life
looked impressive in winning
his first race, the Rosehill
Second Graduation Stakes.
Trained locally by Morrie
Anderson, he’s an Emperor
(imp.)-Pacifique gelding. As a
rule horses seldom win at next
start following a fall, but Quiet
Life finished on well to beat the
pacemaker South Sea, who
seems bound to win a race in
the near future.
Our Add has now won six
races in eight starts, and on
the other two occasions he
finished fourth. Ridden by B.
Howlett .in the Rosehill Handi-
cap, he was never worse than
second, and won easily from
Gilt Son, who also registered a
fine effort, as he was tailed-off
along the back of the track.
Our Add’s connections are

One of the last three of 17
runners half-a-mile from home,
veteran Top Ruler, who carries
the Tulloch colors, being also
raced by veteran E. A- Haley,
put up a fine performance to
win the Rosehill Welter from
Wonder Way. Top Ruler was
down to a luxury weight for
him —7.10. Earlier in his career
he had been weighted near the
lOst. mark in similar events.

week meeting. Winner also
of a couple of races as a two-
year-old in N.Z., the three-
year-old is by Marco Polo II

ran a fair sort of second to

day, too.
The one and only Billy Cook
is due to give the game finally
away at this month’s-end last
race-day of the season. Bill ——
and what a grand little rider
he has been—holds the record
(made in 1939-40) for the
greatest number of wins (126)
in a Sydney metropolitan
season. Ted McMenamin that
same season brought 117
home. The only other Sydney
rider to top the century is J.
Thompson, with 107 in 1940-41.
More than once Cook rode five
winners in a day, his best after-
noon being at Randwick on
March 28, 1951, when he had
five wins and a third from six
mounts.

“Post”: Tiny apprentice
Harry White’s win at Fleming-
ton at his first ride (mentioned
here on 8/7/’59) was, of
course, not unique. Darby
Munro won at his first three
rides on the same Tuesday
afternoon at Menangle Park
(N.S.W.) around the mid-
-1920’5. J. Finch is another I
recall winning at his first ride
—oi) Triplex at Randwick
about 30 years ago. On the
same topic, there was at least
one apprentice lad who thought
he’d won at his first attempt.
Leading the field over the old
Moorefield (Sydney) 10-fur-
longs years ago, he pulled-up
passing the post the first time
round. He copped a month’s
suspension for incompetence.
Looking fit and slightly
more robust, Sydney jockey
George Moore, in a TV inter-
view in England, made a good
sort of comment in support of
his preference for riding in
England whilst abroad: “In
France I can’t follow the
jockeys because the French
boys talk and yell in their own
language, and at times they
could be saying anything to
me and I could do the wrong
thing, but it is different in Eng-
land. I fully understand when
an English jockey does a spot
of yelling or softer talking.”
Moore said he ranks Tulloch
among the world’s greatest
racehorses, but he’s keen on
the English thoroughbred.

Cover-picture on the June
issue of “Australian Thorough-

tion of an etching of mare and
foal at Segenhoe Stud in the
Hunter Valley (N.S.W.), one of
many pictures done there by
Sydney artist Cedric Emanuel;
and it sets the theme for the
issue, which puts main em-
phasis on Australian thorough-
bred breeding, though with
the usual wider view of some
aspects also of breeding abroad.
An editorial, noting “the
extent of the faith of [Aus-
tralian] breeders in the future
of racing,” despite such signs
as the “diminution of the
ranks of breeders in the past
five years or more,” goes on to
comment on what had looked
like a rather disturbing

Other Sports
In Sydney Rugby Union’s
match of the day Manly beat
Randwick 11-6 in a fast, open
game, Manly winning in the
last minutes with a try and
goal by winger Roberts. Manly
now rejoins Randwick at the
top of the table. University,
which couldn't afford to lose,
beat East 18-11, while in the
three other games three strong
teams met unexpectedly tough
opposition from the three
bottom sides Gordon
struggled to head-off Parra-
matta 14-9 ; St. George, trail-
ing 9-11 at half-time, over-
hauled Drummoyne 20-11, and
North beat Eastwood 14-5,
each side scoring a try. At
Invercargill the British Lions
were flat-out to beat Southland
11-6 after it had been 3-all at
half-time. (This Saturday, at
Dunedin, first Test between the
Lions and N.Z.)
* * *
In the second-last round of
Sydney’s Rugby League Manly
consolidated its place in the
semi-finals by beating South
Sydney 9-6 in a hard, dour
struggle in which only one try
was scored; South tried to
throw the ball about, but
Manly kept the game closed-
up. The other four games were
all high-scoring affairs—-St.
George somewhat luckily out-
pointed North 28-21, West
(with full-back Russell kicking
10 goals) overran East 38-10,
Newtown kept its hopes alive
against Balmain 28-23, and
Canterbury had a one-point
win over Parramatta 21-20.
(Newtown and North, with
South a very rank outsider, are
fighting it out for fourth place.)
* * •
Only one change in the
V.F.L. “four” after Saturday
—North drops back from
second to third, and Carlton
takes its place. South Melbourne,
fourth, is two games behind Mel-
bourne and Carlton, and one
behind North; and it is now one
game ahead of St. Kilda. Behind
the Saints, one game further back
still, come four teams, Hawthorn,
Fitzroy, Collingwood and Essendon,
all still with “final-four” hopes;
but it will take a lot of good foot-
ball (and good luck) for any of the
four to break through.
On Saturday, Melbourne, strik-
ingly accurate (the week before,
against St. Kilda, the Demons
kicked shockingly, 9.23), thrashed
North 20.8-6.10. State cricketer
Neil Crompton, promoted in place
of the injured “Bluey” Adams as
rover, kicked seven goals. Carlton
gave St. Kilda a football lesson,
15.21-8.18, while South Melbourne,
with rover Skilton the particular
star, was too fast and too strong
for Geelong, 17.16-12.12, after the
Cats had a nine-point lead at half-
time ; South clapped on 7.3 to
0.3 in the third term. Essendon,
with young full-forward Evans bag-
ging nine goals, “kicked the sweep”
against Richmond, 19.20-10.9. In
the most exciting game of the day
Collingwood, at home, scraped
home luckily by one point from
Hawthorn, 10.15-10.14, after having
raced away to a 5.3-0.2 lead at the
first change. In a rough and tough
game Fitzroy beat inaccurate Foot-
scray, 10.13-6.17.

I’ve not seen him completely

“K.R.”: A famous name —
Rhodes —reappeared in Eng-
land’s cricket-team for the
third Test against India (won easily
by England, by an innings and
173 runs). This was Derbyshire’s
Harold Rhodes, a fast-medium
bowler, only in his second full
season with the county. In the Test
he took 4-50 and 0-35. As far as
I know he is not related to York-
shire’s mighty Wilfred Rhodes, now
nearly 82 and blind for several years
past, who began his long and
remarkable Test-career in 1899 as
a left-arm bowler and last-man-in,
eventually so improving with the
bat as to become Jack Hobbs’s
opening partner. In 1926 he was
recalled to England’s team for the
fifth Test at the age of 49, and
played a big part (with the ball)
in England’s winning of the Test —■
and the 1926 Ashes. Rhodes later
played in four Tests against West
Indies in 1929, his last Test
appearances.

UNCABLED
ADDITIONS
THE PARTY AND THE WORKERS
Tn the course of a long article
•*- on “New Developments in
East European Trade-
unionism” a correspondent of
the British monthly “The
World Today” examines “the
contradiction which exists
between the ‘fundamental law’
(a term employed by Khrush-
chev at the twenty-first con-
gress) of the Communist
countries, which makes the
proletariat the dominant class,
and the practice of the Com-
munist party, which insists
absolutely on exercising super-
vision over that same prole-
tariat” :
“Thus, one of the principal
leaders of Kadar’s Hungary,
Georges Marosan, himself a
former trade-unionist of Social-
Democrat allegiance, pro-
claimed to a national confer-
ence of factory-managers on
August 19, 1958, that ‘the work
of the trade-unions would be
effective only if it was pur-
sued under the direction of the
party.’ An identical point of
view was expressed by
Gomulka at the fourth con-
gress of Polish trade-unions in
April, 1958.
“An attempt is sometimes
made to justify the party’s right
of supervision by the fact that
the proletariat, because of the
rapid progress of industrialisa-
tion, has undergone important
changes in structure, bringing
about a temporary eclipse of
its class-consciousness.
“This statement is not totally
without foundation. While the
ideas about the proletariat have
remained unchanged, the pro-
letariat itself has been com-
pletely transformed. The work-
ing-class in the Communist
countries (as indeed in Western
Europe, too) is a ‘class in the
making,’ completely fluid; it
bears hardly any resemblance
to the slightly congealed pro-
letariat of the pre-war years,
where an active minority
Communist, Socialist, trade-
unionist —sometimes managed
to crystallise a spirit of class-
struggle while carrying with it
a traditionalist and inert
majority.
“The situation at present is
entirely different, especially in
those East European countries
(excluding western Czecho-
slovakia and East Germany)
which embarked on industria-
lisation from the starting-point
of a relatively low standard.
In those countries the working-
class, as is stated in the Pro-
gramme of the League of
Yugoslav Communists adopted
at Ljubljana in April, 1958 (the
programme which unleashed a
veritable hurricane of indigna-
tion, more-or-less sincere, in
the whole Communist world),
‘is still young and, in some
aspects, entirely new.’ In fact,
continues the programme, ‘our
—Washington "Post.”
“HOW MUCH MORE DO WE PUT INTO IT?”
working-class recruits the
major part of its effective
strength in the countryside,
which is the cause of numerous
outdated ideas within its ranks.’
“This is as true of Hungary,
Slovakia and Poland as it is of
Yugoslavia. But it should be
noted that the rural and youth-
ful character of the new pro-
letariat has made it more recep-
tive at first to the propaganda
of the regime, to indoctrination,
than were the old workers.
Very often the Communists
have relied for support on the
new workers against the ‘old-
timers’ who were imbued with
reformist, Social - Democratic
and Syndicalist ideas. But, at
the same time, these youthful
elements were more easily dis-
appointed, discouraged by life’s
difficulties; they were also
more susceptible than the old
experienced workers to the
promptings of an exaggerated
anti-Communism.
“The fact is that Poznan and
Budapest, while bringing into
the open the conflict between
the proletariat and the dictator-
ship exercised in its name, have
led the Communist leaders to
inquire into the real circum-
stances of the workers and
their opinion. Until then it
was enough to exalt the historic
mission of the proletariat with-
out much caring what it was
or what it thought. Since 1956
the Communist leaders have
been taking the trouble to
analyse its composition and-its
state of mind, even if only to
discover new means of indoc-
trination:
“Thus ‘Nepszabadsag’ pub-
lished the results of an investi-
gation showing that between
1949 and 1954 the strength of
the Hungarian proletariat had
increased by 460,000 workers,
of whom 200,000 were of
peasant origin. During the
same period about 20,000
workers were given administra-
tive jobs (as civil servants,
clerks in industry, the police,
the Army, etc.)-
“Doubtless this social pro-
motion, due to services
rendered to the party, is one of
the principal attractions of the
Communist regimes. It is the
workers themselves —the core
of the ‘new class’ —who con-
stitute the true framework of
these regimes. The majority
of them, bound body and soul
to the regime to which they owe
everything the example of
Hungary in 1956 demonstrated
this—remain faithful even
when everyone else deserts.
But, in raising these reliable
elements from their original
position in the scheme, the
Communist leaders have
lessened the party’s influence in
the factories —the more so
since the place of those ‘pro-
moted’ has often been taken by
‘declasse’ elements: former
kulaks or bourgeois who have
made no attempt to hide their
dislike of Communism.
“Another investigation,
carried out by the Hungarian
trade-unions in 20 large enter-
prises in 1957, stated that of a
complement of 90,000 workers,
36,000 were newcomers, of
whom 32.5 per cent, were
peasants, the others being
artisans, ‘declasses bourgeois,’
or women.
“The increasing number of
the latter, incontestably more
traditionalist than the men, has
also contributed to modify the
look of the proletariat. In any
case, one now has to deal with
a working-class in the heart of
which, according to ‘Nepsza-
badsag,’ ‘clerical reaction has
gained ground,’ where ‘the
influence of counter-revolu-
tionary opinions is perceptible,’
and where ‘one often en-
counters nationalist, chauvi-
nistic, irredentist, or anti-
Semitic views.’ Nevertheless,
the intellectual level of this
proletariat does not seem to
have gone down.
“There is reason to believe
(but this the investigators
would take good care not to
say) that the workers’ anti-
Socialism this anti-Socialism
which the leaders interpret as
a sign of immaturity—should
be attributed principally to the
fact that the workers identify
Socialism with the Communist
experiment, with which they
appear to be dissatisfied.
“It might perhaps have been
possible to bring them back to
Socialism if there had been
faith in the workers’ councils’
movement. This may be in-
ferred from the results of an
important investigation made
in Poland by a group of
researchers in three stages: in


Falffi lit Oie
Fuiure
The movement of cattle was underlined in a
recent survey by the Bureau of Agricultural
Economics as one of the most critical problems
facing the Australian beef industry.
It is a problem to which Australians with a
clear faith in their country should now be
turning attention.
The survey was made in the Leichhardt-Gilbert
area of North Queensland —in the State where
more than half our twelve-million beef cattle
are raised.
And it found that about two-thirds of the
estimated potential turn-off from those higher
regions in an average year came from outside
convenient walking distance to selling centres or
other rail points.
The significant conclusion was that there
could be considerable development of these cattle
lands only if three hundred thousand head of
market stock, mainly young stores, could be moved
each year by road-train from as far as three
hundred miles from rail trucking points.
Now, what is true in the 117,000 square miles
under survey is true, to larger scale, through the
whole of our vast cattle areas beyond the reach
of railways.
That, in short, is the limiting factor now in
the expansion of Australian beef—at a time when
wider opportunities are opening for our exports in
the meat markets of the world, and when expansion
relies on our ability to get more stock, and
younger stock, out of the interior in good condition.
It is obvious, thinking ahead to the future,
that the wasteful methods now used in so much
of our stock movement will have to be eliminated:
that in the absence of railways, roads must be built
to take road-trains for the carriage of cattle.
Experience has shown that private enterprise
will quickly take advantage of any such facilities
that are provided.
This, indeed, was the history in the Argentine,
where a great international beef industry was built
up only after public leadership and private
investment had combined to give the country an
efficient system of stock transport.
October, 1956, April, 1957, and
February, 1958. These results
show that the workers had
hoped for much from the
creation of the workers’
councils, but as these councils
were gradually ‘recouped’ by
the party they lost interest and
confidence in them.
Trade-union Revival
“The Communist leaders un-
doubtedly hoped to break the
apathy and indifference of the
workers, to interest them in the
productivity of their factories.
But they did not wish to grant
them any rights of supervision
or decision which might en-
danger the prerogatives of the
directors. This trend, involv-
ing a readiness to extend
slightly the scope of the trade-
unions while still keeping them
under the overall supervision
of the party and of the State,
was expressed particularly in
a resolution of the Central
Committee of the Soviet C.P.
on the work of trade-unions
(September 17, 1957).
“This resolution, which was
to serve as a model to all the
Communist countries, declared:
‘lt is through the intermediary
of the trade-unions that the
working-class ought to exercise
its control over the activity of
the officials who administer
production following the prin-
cipal of personal responsi-
bility.’
“In this scheme the
authorities of the party called
upon the trade-unions (who are
themselves practically never
authorised to take the initiative)
to convene as often as possible
‘production assemblies’ where
the whole staff would discuss
problems of production. At the
same time the top management
of the trade-unions were called
upon to associate themselves
with Governmental decisions
concerning working-hours and
wages; A vast campaign- was
then organised throughout the
Soviet Union to revivify the
trade-unions, giving them more
freedom to negotiate collective
contracts with the manage-
ment, to whom, by means of
the decentralisation measures,
increased powers had recently
been given.
“To those who objected that
the rights of control and
criticism conceded to the
trade - unions were only
theoretical, the example was
quoted of some particular
director in Lvov or Minsk who
had been dismissed from his
post, as a result of trade-union
intervention, for not having
paid sufficient attention to the
voice of the workers. In the
same spirit of ‘revival,’ the
chairman of the Soviet trade-
unions, Grishin, in a speech to
the twenty-first congress,
boasted of the progress
achieved by his movement,
which has at present 52-million
members.
“Of course, the primary task
of the Soviet unions is still,
according to him, to carry on
the struggle ‘for the accom-
plishment of the seven-year
plan in five or six years’ ; but
the trade-unions have also to
their credit the fact that they
have appreciably improved
measures of protection from
accidents and are exercising a
stricter control over labor legis-
lation. Henceforth, Grishin
pointed out, ‘no worker could
be sacked in the U.S.S.R. with-
out the approval of the trade-
union.’
“A similar development can
be discerned in Czechoslovakia,
where the trade-union move-
ment, as is well known,
possesses strong roots. In
Czechoslovakia, as in Russia,
certain trade-union leaders wish
to give to ‘conferences on pro-
duction’ the character of a ‘per-
manent participation by the
workers in management’
which is not in itself convincing.
But the discussion on the new
tasks of the . trade-unions
breaks away sometimes from
the academic character which
certain managers try to impose
on it. ‘More and more,’ stated
a Yugoslav journalist, ‘the view
is making itself felt that the
trade-unions should not con-
cern themselves solely with the
improvement of production but
also with its organisation, and
should enjoy much wider
rights.’
“However, the criticisms that
are so often heard among some
of the leaders, particularly in
Hungary and Poland, seem
sometimes to be merely a fresh
pretext to justify party control.
It is freely admitted that the
party made mistakes in the past
in wishing to ‘bureaucratise the
trade-unions’ at any price;
but, having once corrected
these errors, it has every right
to guide the trade-union move-
ment.”

Soon, perhaps, the Queen may
feel and now many of her
subjects overseas would be
delighted if she did —that in-
formal holidays within the
[British] Commonwealth would
not take-up too much of her
time and would, far from
fatiguing her, give her fresh
strength for the arduous life
which she is forced to lead.

could both, for example, be
permanent Royal residences
giving the Canadian and New
Zealand people a sense of in-
timacy with her Majesty which
no Royal tour can provide. We,
in this country, accustomed as
we are to see the Queen among
us as a matter of course, do
not perhaps appreciate how
warmly our brothers overseas
would welcome the informal
presence of her Majesty in
their countries from time to
time.
“To make this suggestion is
not to seek to increase in any
way the heavy burdens which
the Queen must bear, but the
speed and comfort of modern
travel does make it possible for
the nations of the Common-
wealth to share the Queen with
us. A few weeks’ holiday in
one or other of her realms
beyond these islands could not
but benefit the Queen and,
incidentally, strengthen the
links upon which the whole
idea of the [British] Common-
wealth depends.”
Labor and the Bomb
'T'he “Manchester Guardian”
summarises press comment
on the U.K. Labor party’s
policy statement that, while it
does not advocate the uni-
lateral renunciation by Britain
of nuclear weapons, it would,
if elected, try to sponsor an
international “non - nuclear
club”:
“The ‘Daily Telegraph’ con-
cluded that it was ‘the biggest
piece of humbug’ yet produced
by Socialist policy-makers. It
said, nevertheless, that ‘Con-
servatives should not make the
error of underestimating the
emotional arnd demagogic
appeal in the new policy.’
“At the other end of the
scale, the ‘Daily Mirror’ wants
to ‘Tell Britain’ all about it,
and the ‘Daily Herald’ has
given it ‘eager support,’
although continuing to say that
it would have liked to see
proposals that went much
farther. The ‘Times’ has not
pronounced since its appeal for
graduated deterrents.
“[The] popular press, how-
ever, gave the conflict within
the Labor party extensive
treatment, with centre-page
articles in the ‘Express,’ ‘Mail’
and ‘News Chronicle.’ In the
‘Express’ the chief topic was
whether Mr. Cousins would
revolt or toe the line.
“In the ‘Mail,’ Mr. Henry
Fairlie was ecstatic about the
brilliance of Mr. Gaitskell’s
tactics. ‘Why Wellington Gait-
skell held his fire’ was the
heading, and we were told that
‘the old touch is back’:
Like Wellington at Waterloo [Mr.
Fairlie wrote] he has drawn-up his
troops in squares, against which the
dashing cavalry-charges of the
enemy have failed to make more
than a momentary impression.
If a man has dropped in his place
there has been another behind him
to step into the breach. Mr. Cousins
and Mr. Willis, Mr. Driberg and
Mr. Greenwood —uncertain auxili-
aries, anyhow—all have been
allowed to be expendable, for there
are others at their backs.
“In the ‘News Chronicle’
Mr. Douglas Brown has been
less enthusiastic about both
policy and tactics. He has
likened the policy statement to
the fairytale of the emperor’s
clothes and has concluded that
the emperor :s naked, and he
says that Mr. Greenwood gave
the National Executive the
opportunity three months ago
to anticipate the trend of
events, but it spurned the idea.
“In the ‘Mirror,’ Mr. Cross-
man has stuck to putting for-
ward the merits of trying to
form a non-nuclear club.
“On the whole, Mr. Gait-
skell may feel not unhappy
about the press reception of
his change of policy. And has
not even Mr. Grimond said
that, whatever the trade-union
pressures behind the qhange,
Mr. Gaitskell ‘has been
genuinely and deeply worried
about our defence policy’?”

trip by coach and electric lift,
thanks to an act of exhibition-
ism as fantastic as those of mad
King Ludwig II in other parts
of the same province.
Holiday-makers, mainly
Germans, flock there by the
thousand, but not, so far as
can be seen, in any spirit of
pilgrimage. In fact, the lift-
attendant commented on the
way down: “You’ve enjoyed,
I hope, seeing the place that
Hitler built for your benefit
and mine.”
The whole district is now a
recreation-area for Americans.
The former Platterhof Hotel,
behind the ruined S.S. barracks,
is a leave-and-rest centre. And
the restaurant, “Zum Turken,”
whose owner was put into a
concentration-camp prepara-
tory to its being used as
Gestapo headquarters, has
been restored to his daughter.
All, all is different.
It is said that German
children, naturally inquisitive
about Hitler,- are told by their
teachers that he did some
good, for he built the auto-
bahnen and cured unemploy-
ment, but he failed because he
couldn’t win wars.
Nevertheless, the brief
account of the Obersalzberg
set-up in the guide-book must
have some chastening effect if
only because it discounts the
idea of a country retreat. The
countless young Germans who
change buses at Hintereck
before proceeding to Kehlstein
can hardly fail to notice that
this was no rustic idyll but an
armed hideout, taut with iron,
jack-boot militarism and fear-
fully dependent upon the
grisly paraphernalia of the
secret police.
To ourselves, who had no
cause whatever for complaint
or suspicion, the Austrian
frontier seemed invitingly
near.
{To be continued )
has the basis of commonsense
and a certain amount of
hygiene.
Pipes are like railway-
engines ; you have to learn to
stoke, draw and clean them.
You don’t just get a piece of
wood with a hole in it, jamb
some tobacco down, apply the
lucifer, and sit back to enjoy
it. Pipe-smoking is an art, like
writing blank verse, or think-
ing up a new alibi for that late
night at the club.
It has certain laws which
must not be violated, or the
penalties are a burnt tongue, a
feeling as though your smoke-
box has been choked, and
frustration.
Follow carefully, would-be
pupils:
The Pipe: Don’t buy a pipe
which looks as though you
picked up an ironbark log
from somewhere. If you are to
take up pipe-smoking (finding
it impossible to desist alto-
gether), get a small and light
pipe, and if your toofies are
not in the best shape, a very
light pipe.
Do not go in for the heavy,
large, awkward, tobacco-con-
suming, expensive pipes. Your
pipe wants to have a small
bowl, because the size of the
bowl controls, to some extent,
the amount you smoke, and a
small bowl allows you to
scrape it out after every pipe
or so without incurring a con-
siderable financial loss in this
dear luxury. Buy several
cheap pipes all of the same
weight and pattern, because
you can alternate pipes and
stems if you damage either.
The Tobacco : A light, even-
burning Virginian flake-cut,
which can be given a little more
personality by rubbing into it
some 5 per cent, to 10 per cent,
of a Rhodesian. If you like
just a trace of scent to please
the ladies, and those poor,
worm-eaten males who smoke
“the effeminate cigarette,” and
which is also a concession to
those who think pipe-smoking
a little too manly, a small per-
centage of such scented to-
baccos may be added.
Filling Pipe: Rub your
tobacco up evenly, and fill the
pipe with a slight pressure.
Don’t ram it down as though
you are burying an enemy, nor
leave it so loose that it will
burn away quickly and scorch
your tongue.
Lighting: Use a wooden
"I pity his poor wife , I do —him sittin' there night after
night just gazin' into space."
match. Outski petrol-lightski.
Hygiene: Always keep a
number of pipes cleaned-out
and lying in the sun on a
veranda or porch, and use them
in rotation. Always carry pipe-
cleaners. If you are a wet-
smoker, a small piece of
clinker in the bottom of the
pipe will prevent your tobacco
getting wet and contaminating
the whole-of the bowl.
Warning: Don’t inhale.
Another Warning: If you
meet-up with a confirmed
“tobacco - borrower” you
should know that he always
carries an extra-large pipe in
his pocket which he fills
with tobacco from your pouch,
and empties the tobacco into
his pouch when he gets around
the corner. Of course, he has
an ordinary-sized pipe for his
actual smoking.

“Whichways?” asked Tim.
“Either. Don’t much matter,
barring the tide.”
“Why, Tim,” said Mrs. Tim,
“they drums of oil.”
“I do be thinking of they,”
said Tim. “There’s these here
drums of oil I picked up in
Maroota, week or two back.
They be for Ellises. I brung
them upalong here to take
them downalong there, but
Missis she says”
“Tim never do be hisself
after he go to Ellises,” Mrs.
Tim interposed. “Poor belly
Tim has, take me me time
keeping me eye on it. And his
forgetting hisself at Ellises for
all he’s signed the pledge!
Toby carries his away, true,
but carried away by hisself or
another, ’tis his own belly that
suffers. And Toby all out to
carry everone away and make
them forget he was a lag in the
old days and not spoke to by
none of us.”
“The past must bury the
past, Missis.”
“But not so fast that we’re
forgetting all about it.”
The crew now looked
brighter. There was purpose
in life, a place to go for a set
reason. They went off to load
the drums of oil with the help
of Tim and the boys. Miss
Piggins sat on at the table. All
tuckered-out the poor thing
was, Mrs. Tim decided. Poor
Piggins! No man and no place
of her own! Mrs. Tim felt
warmth round her heart at
having Tim and the boys
and her own good way of life.
“You ever been to Ellises?”
she asked.
“No,” said Miss Piggins. “I
have been to places against
my better judgment, but not
Ellises. Never Ellises. I would
never go there alive, Mrs. Lan-
caster. If you heard of me at
Ellises you would know my
dead body had been carried
there.”
It was into Mrs. Tim’s own
ear that Miss Piggins spoke
these words. Mrs. Tim was as
well thought-of on the river
as Red Andy was.
/''iN the outgoing tide they
set out for Ellises. They
went downalong, repassing the
mouth of the MacDonald and
the township at The Branch.
The crew didn’t glance at the
inn this time. Better things
lay ahead.
The storeboat arrived at
Ellises in the middle of the
afternoon, tied-up and un-
loaded. Then the crew began
carrying up the oil, one drum
at a time. They were some
time between trips. As the
afternoon began to wear away
it occurred to Miss Piggins that
she had no idea where she was
going to sleep that night. She
looked about her.
The landing was trim, made
of planks, no sign of rotting
or borers. A neat path wound
upward through the trees
swaying in the late afternoon
breeze. She caught glimpses of
a stone house ; the sun lower-
ing, glinted on glass windows.
It was pleasant to Miss
Piggins to see glass windows.
It gave her a sense of well-
being, of peace. But this was
Elisses, she reminded herself,
ex-convicts both of them. She
had had to mix with all sorts,
but not convicts to her know-
tedge.
The men didn’t come back,
The sun began to sink. The
breeze cooled. It went through
her thin cloak, and sighed in
the treetops. There was a
gnawing inside her. She recog-
nised it. She had had it often.
It was hunger.
The sun set. Still the men
didn’t come. Darkness fell,
Only a glimpse of lit windows,
when the wind swayed the
trees, for comfort. Large white
stars appeared in the black sky
above. The boat swayed ; its
timbers creaked; the dark
water slapped against it. Un-
easy stories went through her
mind . . .
A man left sitting in a boat,
drowned in the river when the
other men came back, for no
reason that anyone could find.
Mr. Wiseman, from The
Branch, trampled by cattle he
was swimming across just
about here. A convict woman
assigned to a man in these
parts ; he had wanted her for
a wife but she was old and
ugly, so he killed her and gave
another convict a guinea to
bury her. The convict had
thrown her in the water and
it was said she floated still
beneath the surface of the
water . . .
Frightened of ghosts by day,
Miss Piggins found them un-
endurable in the darkness of
the night. She rose, stepped
on to the landing and went
hurrying up the path between
the trees.
The house was well lit. The
windows glowed with welcom-
ing light. She knocked on the
door, sharply.
The echoes of her knocking
died away. Silence, then
muffled footsteps. The door
opened. Miss Piggins and Jess
Ellis faced one another.
Such a sight Miss Piggins
had never thought to behold.
But Jess’s red wig and violet-
powdered face, very much
alive, were preferable to con-
vict bodies floating in the
water. Beyond Jess was the
hall, lit by a hanging lamp,
glass prisms glittering about it.
The steady lamplight showed
red carpet and polished furni-
ture. Grand, quite grand, the
grandest hall Miss Piggins had
seen along the river.
Jess recognised Miss Piggins
instantly. “Miss Piggins!” she
exclaimed. “Come in and wel-
come. I am obliged that you
come and visit with us. Because
of our Lucy. Oh, ladylike she
is, with pretty ways. She’s a
miracle is Lucy. Toby and me
ugly as sin bringing forth a
blossom like an angel! ”
Miss Piggins remembered as
Jess drew her into the hall, that;
the Ellises had a daughter. She
had been at school away from
the river, but had come home.
Jess opened a door leading
off the hall.
“Look, Lucy, look who’s
here! Miss Piggins off the
storeboat. She’s come to visit
with us as you said you
wanted. She”
“Let her fry in hell,” said
Lucy languidly.
“But Lucy”

something with her till I
remember what I wanted her
for.”
“Won’t you look at her,
Lucy? She’s”
- A flung object splintered
against the half-open door,
and Jess shut it quickly.
“We won’t rouse her. It
might bring on one of her
turns,” Jess said. “Delicate she
is, Miss Piggins, and needs
guarding. She must get out
more, the doctor says. Now
me and Toby don’t get about
much, but with you so kindly
coming to take our Lucy out
. . .” Jess sighed happily. “Ah,
Toby and me won’t ever forget
it, Miss Piggins.”
She led the way to a small
but pleasant room, with a good
bed and fine, high mattress.
“I’ll leave you for a little.
When you’re ready come out-
side for refreshment. Make
our home your home, our
.things your things. We’ve full
and plenty and you shall have
your share. Toby and me never
forget those who treat us
proper.”
When she had gone Miss
Piggins sank upon the bed.
She didn’t know what sort of
a situation she had taken upon
herself now. But whatever it
was she was staying. A room,
a bed, a welcome. Her Papa
must have known when he
sent her away that a place
waited for her. The ways of
life were mysterious. No one
floated forever upon a river.
How and where they came to
rest was their own business.
'T'he crew woke next morn-
ing surprised to find them-
selves on the boat, tied-up at
Ellis’s landing. Recollection
came back slowly. There
seemed to be something wrong
Hadn’t they had a passenger?
“Bejabbers, yes,” said Joe.
“Piggins! ”
“She ain’t here,” said Jeddy.
“She was yestiddy,” replied
Joe. “I remember for sure.
Let me think.”
He held his head and
thought. Jeddy and Bill did
likewise. Regretfully, one by
one, they admitted that she had
been there yesterday. They
admitted also that she wasn t
there now. And no place in
sight apart from Ellises, the
one place on the river Miss
Piggins refused to go.
There was only one conclu-
sion. Joe pronounced her
requiem. “Pore ole b ,”
he said. ,
They peered down through
the clear water. Nothing but
the river bottom.
“Floated off some place.
Went out with the tide. Sharks
got her by this.”
“Nothing we can do.”
“Peaceful end, it’s said.”
“Yes ; but not nice to lose
anyone.”
As the tide was coming in
they put the boat about and
set off upalong. Memory grew
clearer and clearer. Jeddy
remembered half-waking in
the dark and hearing a splash.
Bill had dreamt someone had
“Halt! Who goes there?”
called “Save me! Save me! ”
Now he knew it hadn’t been a
dream at all.
They discussed these things
as they went along. When The
Branch came in sight, and the
inn they hadn’t been able to
visit yesterday reminded them
overwhelmingly of her absence,
they remembered they hadn’t
paid their last respects to Miss
Piggins.
They set the boat’s bell
tolling.
When people ran out of their
houses down to the river bank,
Joe shouted, “We toll for
Piggins, lost overboard on the
night of the 25th. R.1.P.”
Men bared their heads and
women threw a scarf or shawl,
or if they had nothing else,
placed a handkerchief over
their heads. The river had
always been known to do what
was seemly in these matters.
And two days later it was
given to Andy Flanagan
to see the ghost of Miss Piggins,
in broad daylight, clothed in
a puce-silk dress, a puce-straw
bonnet, a matching parasol
above her head. The ghost
was seated beside Lucy Ellis in
the Ellis -boat, headed towards
Windsor.
Red Andy was so overcome
that he had to put his own boat
in at Lancaster’s and go up to
the house for a pannikin of
tea.
He told his story while Mrs.
Tim nodded her head
vigorously.
“It’s a grand gift you have
Andy, for I heard from
Piggins’s own lips that she
would only be seen dead with
the Ellises. Puce dress and
parasol you say. I never did
see that poor dear thing in any
garment but the brown. It was
all she had to her name, to
my knowledge. We can only
take it that in death she fell
upon better days, which is a
hope for the future for all of
us.”
Red Andy had the second
sight. His seeing of Miss
Piggins, two days after the
crew saw her drown before
their eyes, added to his reputa-
tion. The fact that Miss
Piggins was not a well-
mannered ghost, appearing to
this one then to that, oftener
than was decent, made no
difference. She appeared to

Careers in Philanthropy
That “crust” which “Ar-
doyne’s” professional money-
raiser is making (B. 1/7/’59)
is apparently pretty well-
buttered indeed.
The fund-raising fee in the
case of one parish of about
1000 members was £l7OO. For
this the professional guaran-
teed that the parish’s income
for the six months following
introduction of the campaign
would at least equal its income
for the six months before the
campaign, plus the £l7OO fee,
plus the cost of a “free”
loyalty dinner and the printing
of an illustrated brochure—
both essential parts of these
schemes.
The professional claimed,
therefore, that the parish could
not lose, but he didn’t men-
tion the fact that the increased
income, the £l7OO fee and the
cost of the dinner and brochure
all came from the same source
—the parishioners’ pockets.
Ministers and parish com-
mittees seem to be pleased
with the results of such
schemes, but the fee seems
excessive for the few weeks
the professional spends in the
parish. No wonder some
churches are starting schemes
without the assistance of the
experts. — Pin (N.S.W.).
Errors By Novelists
No doubt “any bright 14-
year-old boy from the bush”
could have successfully per-
formed the check on back-
ground accuracy which fell to
the lot of H. A. Lindsay (B.
24/6/’59) ; but is such an opera-
tion worth performing except
before a radio-audience at a
quiz-kid session?
Whether or not there are
foxes in Tasmania, or whether
bushrangers loaded their fire-
arms in front or behind doesn’t
affect the literary merit, if any,
of a narrative. Guide-book
accuracy doesn’t exist in
literature, any more than it
exists, or should exist, in pic-
torial art. Strict guide-book
accuracy in poetry would kill
the poetic instinct and be an
affront to poetic truth.
As for portraying Aus-
tralians as “normal human-
beings,” this also would seem
to imply a standard for Aus-
tralian literature that would
quickly bring it to extinction.

Education Problems
There’s an aspect of educa-
tion, at least in W.A., which
“Sir” didn’t mention (B.
10/6/’59), although he prob-
ably implied it in his attack
on understaffed and over-
crowded schools. This is the
standard attained by those —
“Better see the M.O. about his hypertension in the
presence of superior officers.
the big majority—who have no
intention of going further with
their education than the law
requires.
A couple of years back W.A.
adopted what is called
“chronological promotion” —
each child is promoted accord-
ing to age, not the ability to
pass exams. In many ways
this is admirable. It abolishes
that refinement of cruelty the
slow learner and the child
naturally not adapted to book-
learning having to remain year
after year in a class of younger
children.
It could be the nearly ideal
system, but it requires a maxi-
mum of 20 to a class. Where
classes range up to 50 or more,
the inclusion of a number of
pupils with practically no
basic training places insuper-
able obstacles in the teacher’s
way. It handicaps all the
pupils, and results in children
in comparatively high grades
having very primitive ideas of
reading and writing.
There are children in fifth
grades in W.A. schools who
would boggle at reading or
writing almost any four-letter
word ; there are others in first-
and second-year high-schools
who can’t read and write
intelligently. Result is there
are typists who can’t spell
and artisans who can’t read
anything but the sporting-
pages.
Modern education aims at
encouraging and channelling
the individual talents of each
pupil, and it succeeds in a
great many cases. But there
should be greater insistence
that those who are not scholars
should leave school with a
reasonable understanding of
the written word. Spin

Teaching Languages
“Hebridean” (B. 1/ 7 / ’59)
gives us a typical slice of the
pedagogical mind. Grammar
itself is an invention of the
pedagogues, and a compara-
tively recent one (450 b.g.)
compared with the history of
language. Protagoras, hardly
2000 years ago, fitted the
machinery of grammar to
Greek, and thence, via Latin,
it became harnessed to other
languages not excluding
Chinese, a naturally grammar-
less tongue —and this imposi-
tion is now used as a kind of
yardstick for measuring
academic worth in schools.
Age has nothing to do with
the ability to learn a foreign
language. The first necessity
is the urge, or willingness, to
pick it up; and the urge can
be fostered by any intelligent
teacher in any classroom. The
true natural order is: expres-
sion first, grammar later. The
direct method of teaching
languages is not by any means
a recent discovery: it was first
outlined by Professor Vietor in
1882.
We don’t teach French and
German, etc., as a kind of side-
kick to maths or science or
anything else. “The alleged
French accent of teachers who
have never left the shores of
Australia” might not be of
much assistance to pupils, but
the very same could be said,
and with much greater point,
of many who teach English in
Australian classrooms. As for
the lack of a French-speaking
community, we have a remedy
at hand in gramophone-
records, radio, films (special
films for the purpose have been
in production since 1946 at
least), drama, newspapers and
even comics (in French)—if
the teacher is intelligent
enough to make use of them.,
-Sir (Q.).
It is no doubt true that
French is a living language and
that this depends on its being
used as a well-defined and
vigorous medium of everyday
communication. But the pur-
pose of teaching French (or
any foreign language) in
schools is not to equip future
travellers or interpreters, but
to make available written
works of literary, scientific or
technical interest.
The high-school of today
has no time for such accom-
plishments as the fluent speak-
ing of foreign languages—
there isn’t much point in it.
However, theoretical and
grammatical knowledge is use-
ful in that it can easily be
supplemented later and, with
a knowledge of the argot,
make a person truly proficient
in the language. R. B.

handled in Australia today. The message is urgent —it is essential that it is clear in the
/
original writing—clear in the final • reception. Clarity—important, urgent clarity like
this —can be achieved only by the use of a paper that will stand up to high-speed,
all-weather handling.
Each year the Postmaster-General’s Department handles over 22,500,000 telegrams.
When you write out a telegram at your Post Office on the buff form, you are writing on
“Burnie” Standard Bond, a paper evolved through constant exacting research by
A.P.P.M. chemists, scientists and engineers. “Burnie” Standard Bond is ideally suited
to the needs of one of Australia’s most “urgent” services.

o
cadence earned the soldier—he
was not mustered as a musician
—a reprimand for “idleness”
and possible punishment. In
those days the simple issue-
trumpet was the only instru-
ment used, and the calls were
always sounded as Handel
meant them to be when he
composed them.
Since the war, I have often
attended ceremonies where t
trumpets are sounded and been
surprised to find that men who
are obviously musicians dressed
in uniform have appeared with
key-trumpets —in which I
suspect even a reed.
These “soldiers” have
shamed the uniform they wear
by constantly sounding false
notes and doing all the things
which would have earned them
endless extra practice from the
most lenient of pre-war trumpet-
majors or commanders. They
seem to get away with it—and
the only time you hear the cails
sounded properly is when a
couple of old Light Horse
trumpeters get together, in
plain clothes, and sound the
calls in unison just like they
used to be sounded in the days
when the world was young and
soldiering was fun and not a
matter for experts.
Couldn’t the Army learn
that music is part of what
makes soldiers tick and that
the trumpet, above all, is the
instrument that gives men “self-
starters”? If this was recog-
nised, they might again enlist
trumpeters —not musicians—
who look like soldiers and can
play their instruments in a
smart and soldierly manner. —

Bananaland Progress?
“North's” reference to finan-
cial assistance by the Queens-
land Government for water-
conservation (B. l/7/’59) high-
lights the traditional muddled
thinking of the Queensland
Government and its Agricul-
tural Bank regarding means for
promoting that State’s rural
development.
The bank will advance
money for approved water-
supply works, but only on con-
dition that any existing mort-
gagee cedes priority to the
bank. The bank (and the
Government) always tries to
avoid bearing any part of the
ultimate cost and never shares
any part of the risk-taking that
is usually inseparable from
progress, especially in a young,
virile nation.
The bank’s paramount aim
is to play safe even if it means
that Queensland’s rural
industry will languish. This
contrasts sharply with Govern-
mental practices in the U.S.,
Russia and other places where
much more emphasis is placed
upon development than on
avoiding reasonable costs and
risks.
Notwithstanding Queens-
land’s fine natural resources
and greater potential, the
average annual rate of increase
in its population was the
second-lowest in Australia
during the seven years 1947-
1954 ( Australian Year Book,


1958 p. 567). Between 1940
and the end of 1958 the popu-
lation of Queensland rose by
393,366, while in little Vic-
toria it rose by 856,001. Wake-
up, Queensland! — Perspective

School Hours
The N.S.W. Department of
Education spends many
millions of pounds annually—
much of it on new buildings—
and yet finds itself chronically
short of accommodation and
teachers. It could well take a
leaf out of the book of the
Swedish department, which
recently took a vote of its
pupils on continuation of the
six-day study-week. The
pupils voted almost unani-
mously in favor of it.
Clearly a six-day study-
week would enable pupils to
qualify much sooner than in
a five-day week, thus relieving
the pressure on both accommo-
dation and staff. It might not
be popular with either pupils
or teachers, particularly in
Australia, where a goodly
portion of the present five-day
week is already devoted to
sport; but in the national
interest the education
authorities ought to be strong
enough to introduce and
enforce it.
There is a terrific waste of
ccommodation in every State
through schools being closed
from Friday afternoon until
Monday morning and for long
periods during the all-too-
frequent holidays. Portion of
this loss would be avoided if
classes were conducted six days
a week ; and there could be a
further saving, provided
teachers were available, if
holiday-periods were staggered
to ensure that study was going
on throughout practically the
whole year. I should think that
if the department set out to
achieve this it could, in a few
years, train sufficient teachers
to make the scheme work. —

C.P.S. Insurance
“Central” (B. 24/6/’59) says
that before the Commonwealth
Public Service Superannuation
Act was introduced permanent
employees had to take out a
certain amount of insurance,
the policies being held by the
various departments against
“What with TV and satellites and man-made
planets , how do you expect me to serve you with
that old-world courtesy P”
any serious misdemeanor by
the insured employee.
My impression is that the
primary purpose of the require-
ment was to ensure that, when
the public servant retired at 60,
even though he had been im-
provident, he would have Chis
insurance money to fall back
on. In other words, compul-
sory insurance was the best
substitute available at the time
for superannuation.
In pre-superannuation days,
when my appointment in the
Commonwealth Public Service
was confirmed, the insurance-
company, in the light of the
medical report, offered me a
loaded policy payable at 40,
which of course was no good
from the departmental view-
point.
With visions of being thrown
out of the public service at a
time when jobs were not as
plentiful as they are now I
hastily consulted the regula-
tions. I discovered something
which I learned later was occa-
sionally to be found in various
public-service rules—one regu-
lation which, wholly or
partially, overcame another.
In this case, one regu-
lation required me to insure
my life, payable at 60; the
other stated that if I couldn’t
do so small amounts would be
deducted from my salary every
quarter and paid into the Com-
monwealth Treasury. Years
later when I resigned from the
public service I collected the

Local-government Finance
In trying to break-down my
case against the use of traffic-
licence fees for other than
road-construction and -main-
tenance, “R.H.G.” assumes
that I’m unfamiliar with local-
government finance and that I
wasn’t able correctly to assess
my road-board’s statement of
receipts and expenditure.
Both assumptions are un-
warranted ; and in giving the
figures of money spent on
“roads” as against money
received in traffic-licence fees
I was careful to include all
expenses that could possibly
come under that heading.
But let me quote from
figures supplied by a man who
can’t be accused of “un-
familiarity with the ramifica-
tions” of local-government
finance.
In an address to the dele-
gates at last year’s Local
Government Week in Perth
the Assistant-Secretary for
Local Government in W.A.
produced figures covering
receipts and expenditure by
local - government bodies
throughout W.A. for 1954-55 —
apparently the latest year for
which figures could be quoted
with certainty.
In that year revenue from
rates was £2,457,764, represent-
ing 41 per cent, of total
revenue; from traffic-fees,
£987,640 (16 per cent.); from
petrol-tax grants £952,380 (15
per cent.).
The speaker pointed out that
these two items came little
short of the total expenditure
on r0ad5—£1,987,653. He said
that in addition to direct
charges for roads “there would
also be plant-costs," and that
“a goodly portion of debt-
service would also be in respect
of roads.” He added that part
of the motorist’s special tax is
also spent by the Main Roads
Department, and so “it cer-
tainly seems that over the
whole State, roadworks are not
a very big proportion of
expenditure from rates.”
He admitted that local-
governments differ greatly in
this expenditure, but considered
that “the motorist is, in fact,
making a great contribution—
a service charge—for roads.”
He went on to show that
throughout the State “expendi-
ture on halls is more than
twice their revenue” while
recreation-grounds, parks, etc.,
absorb roughly six times their
revenue.” These items produce
a deficit of £1,026,634.
Strangely enough, he found
that “cultural and health activi-
ties did not absorb a very
considerable proportion of the
rate revenue.”
If “R.H.G.’s” board will this
year spend £6OOO more on
roads than it receives in
traffic-fees—and I don’t doubt
it will —then his figures must
be taken to support mine.
From the official figures, over
the whole of the State only
£47,633 of rate-money was
spent on roads in one yean. If
some boards are spending well
in excess of their traffic-fee
allotment, it follows that other
boards must be spending far
less. — Pieter Nuyts (N.S.W.).
Rockin’ Matilda
“B acksa c ’ s” par. (B.
10/6/’59) needs some clari-
fication. “Banjo” Paterson’s
relatives couldn’t prevent
“Waltzing Matilda” from being
rock-’n’-rolled or otherwise
maltreated, because they have
no rights imthe matter.
In 1903 Paterson sold the
copyright of the verse to Angus
and Robertson, Sydney book-
publishers. The copyright of
the music is held by Allan and
Co., Melbourne music-pub-
lishers, who claim that it was
written by Marie Cowan. But
Sidney May (who has written a
book on the origins of “Waltz-
ing Matilda”) and others
maintain that it is substantially,
that of “Thou Bonnie Wood
of Craigielea,” a Scottish
ballad composed in the 18th
century and later turned Into
a march.
When “Backsac” says that,
following the Kipling pre-
cedent, Winston Churchill
could, as a descendant of
Marlborough, object to the
tune sung by his ancestor’s
soldiers being “modernised” in
an Australian setting, he is
apparently referring to “The
Bold [or Gay] Fusilier.”
The words of this soldier-
song of the Marlborough
period were quoted by a con-
tributor in The Bulletin of
23/9/’4l. I don’t know of any
evidence that its music
resembles that of “Matilda” or
even that the tune is on record.
But the words do open-up the
interesting possibility that
“Banjo” in writing his words
was influenced by “The Bold
Fusilier.” Compare “And he
cried as he tramped through
the dear streets of Rochester:
‘Who’ll be a sojer for Marlboro’
with me?’ ” with “And he sang
as he watched and waited till
his billy boiled: ‘You’ll come
a-waltzing, Matilda, with me.' ”
—Fontaine (Vic.).
Marjorie Quinn
Marjorie Quinn, daughter of
the late P. E. Quinn (writer and
Member of Parliament) and
niece of Australian poet
Roderic Quinn, shared in the
excitement and color of a great
period in Australian history.
She began writing poems,
stories and articles almost from
the time she left school. She
was a foundation-member of
the Society of Women Writers
and the first secretary of the
Fellowship of Australian
Writers.
Now on in years, and in
poorish health, she is trying
to finish a book on famous
events and personalities she
has known. '
She is hopelessly crippled
with arthritis. To write the
book she holds a rubber-
padded pencil in her twisted
fingers and very painfully
punches each individual letter
on an old typewriter.
It would take a very long
time to write a book like that,
even for someone who had
written many books before.
Trained welfare-officers have
advised our society that a
modern electric - typewriter,
which can be used with very
little movement of the hands
and fingers, would bring her
new hope. Later it could be
used in the society’s occupa-
tional-training of other handi-
capped people. But the outlay
of approximately £3OO is a. very
difficult undertaking for the
society.
It will be a pity if Marjorie
Quinn cannot finish her book.
Here are the great figures of
Australia’s past seen through
the eyes of a sensitive, intelli-
gent observer who lived very
close to them. With a little
help she could record that
story for all Australia, for all
time.
There are many other people
like Marjorie Quinn on this
society’s books. Most of them
do not ask for charity. They
are willing to work out their
own salvation—if only some-
one will help them take the
first step. — John K. Lavett,

capped Society (N.S.W.).


THE MAN ON THE LAND
“DON'T WORRY I'M SENDING IT TO
GRAZCOS.”
RAINMAKING TRIALS
By “AEROGENES”
A Round Mittagong (N.S.W.)
and in other quarters
also —ideas about rainmaking
used to be confused.
The press had told us that
C.5.1.R.0. rainmakers were
going to fill the Warragamba
Dam for the Water Board, so
we farmers in the catchment
imagined we were going to be
turned into web-footed guinea-
pigs or something. When we
were invited —in the middle of
a wet spell—to hear a talk
by a man from the C.5.1.R.0.
about proposed experiments in
our district we “guinea-pigs”
felt inclined to protest.
By the time the meeting was
held the weather was drier and
much of the opposition had
evaporated. Very few “guinea-
pigs” attended, but those that
did got a good induction into
the mysteries of rainmaking.
It’s a scientific and well-
organised series of experiments,
and offers immense advantages
if it can produce results —even
a negative result could be as
informative as a deluge. Any-
A new footrot treat-
ment containing 74 per
cent, formalin, plus anti-
septic and penetrating
ingredients, is now being
marketed by an Aus-
tralian company.
The new treatment has
been thoroughly tested
under practical condi-
tions, and is officially
registered under the
Victorian Stock Medi-
cines Act.

way, one significant increase
—between 10 per cent, and 15
per cent, in rainfall over a
defined area in the Snowy
Mountains during the last four
years —points to great possi-
bilities.
An officer actively engaged
in research has visited every
centre in the area of the new
experiment, and his lucid
explanations have been wel-
come. There are areas scat-
tered all over south-eastern
Australia where this work is
going on. They are grouped
in pairs, one area being checked
against another, so that man-
made increases in rainfall can
be compared with natural ones.
Generally speaking, Aus-
tralia has a very low rainfall.
The air over our land, how-
ever, carries great quantities
of water, which only requires
suitable conditions to release
it. We are not likely to
exhaust this great supply, which
is constantly being replenished
by air-movements and the
normal cycle of evaporation
from the surface of plants, soil
and sea. In fact, in the form
of vapor, water is present
everywhere, in varying degree.
At the present stage cumulus
clouds are of most interest to
rainmakers. These clouds, fat
with moisture, tower up to
50,000 ft. or more. Tempera-
tures range from well above
freezing-point in the lower
levels to 30deg- below freezing
in the upper parts. Much of
the vapor is in a super-cooled
state—the very small particles
are below freezing-point, but
they haven’t changed to ice, so
they don’t join together and
fall. Scattered through the
cloud, however, are “freezing-
nuclei,” which change to ice
more readily. They can, to
some extent, be collected and
examined, but their nature and
origin is still a mystery.
When conditions are right
these freezing-nuclei attract
other vapor-droplets, which
freeze and build-up particles
substantial enough to fall
towards the earth. As they
fall they gather more particles
from the lower parts of the
cloud, until finally they reach
earth as rain or snow. Hail
is. formed when the turbulence
inside the cloud is so great that
large drops of water are car-
tied up again until they are
frozen solid before falling to
earth.
Whether or'not a cloud will
drop rain depends on whether
or not it contains enough
freezing-nuclei to start the pre-
cipitation. Fine crystals of
silver-iodide act effectively as
freezing-nuclei, and when
suitable clouds are “seeded”
with this chemical it’s been
found—often enough to be
significant—that rain is made
to fall, though normally it
would not have done so. This
fall takes place quite con.-
sistently within about 30min.
of seeding.
Silver-iodide is sown from
the bottom of the cloud,
because the top may be out
of reach. The updraught carries
the crystals right through the
cloud. The chemical —dis-
solved in lacquer thinner,
which is highly inflammable—
is carried in tanks as a liquid.
It is sprayed through jets
beneath the wings and ignited
by hot plugs as it leaves the
nozzles. The liquid burns-off,
leaving tiny crystals of silver-
iodide to be sucked up into
the cloud.
Meteorologists will watch
constantly for cloud-forma-
"tions suitable for seeding, and
aircraft and crews will be ready
at all times to meet the clouds
as they approach the test-
areas. Rain-gauges, placed
about every five miles, will
measure falls, and measure-
ments will also be taken of the
flow of streams in the catch-
ment-areas.
And the “guinea-pigs”?
They are to be protected by
an officer of the Department
of Agriculture who will act as
referee. Any farmer who con-
siders he is being oversupplied
with water, from any cause,
may appeal to his district
agricultural-officer. If this
complaint seems just, the appeal
will be passed to the referee,
who, after investigation, can
call on the C.5.1.R.0. to desist,
The organisation may not have
caused the trouble, and stop-
rainmaking may make no
difference, but at least ®
experimenters are relieved o£
responsibility for hardship and
can make sure they do no
add to it. Seeding will cease
until rainfall again becomes
tolerable,
These trials are not yet an
attempt to produce a worth-
while increase in rainfall?

find them useful. They are

Campbell Town Show
“Gogs”: At the 121st annual
Sheep Show held at Campbell
Town, in the Tasmanian Mid-
lands, the Merino-ram cham-
pionship went to the Winton
Stud.
One of the oldest in Tas-
mania, Winton was founded
in 1835 by David Taylor, a
foundation-member of the
Campbell Town Show Society.
The stud had no notable suc-
cess at the Show until 1854,
when it won its first Merino-
ram championship. Since then
it has taken another 23 ram-
championships, including this
year’s. Today the Winton
Stud is owned by 86-year-old
John Taylor, grandson of the
founder.
Also at the Show there
was a reunion of three cousins
of the Burbury family:
Administrator and Chief Justice
Sir Stanley Burbury, Campbell
Town Show Society president
L. A. Burbury, and Tasmanian
Farmers’, Stockowners’ and
Orchardists’ Association presi-
dent D. L. Burbury. All three
are great-grandsons of Thomas
Burbury, who settled in the
southern Midlands after emi-
grating from England to
Tassie.
The Beef Industry
Up North
“J. 8.”: “F.A.’s” vision (B.
3/6/’59) would mean enormous
capital-expenditure—a total of
£7O million altogether for rail-
ways, according to my calcula-
tions. Allowing for traffic
increases, revenue would still
fall short of gross operating-
costs by 6 per cent., or £2lOO
a rail-mile a year—that is, over
£4 million.
For satisfactory transport of
livestock by road-train, bitu-
men roads are necessary, and
that would mean over 5000
miles of road to be bitumen-
ised, with river-crossings and
bridges to be built and road-
levels in flood-areas raised. At
a conservative estimate this
would cost £6O million, and
maintenance and interest would
add at least £3 million a year.
Road-operators’ charges, then,
could not be under syd. a mile
and, at that rate, cattle cannot
be transported any great
distance.
“F.A.’s” suggestion is sound
enough in principle, but finan-
cial implications, especially the
necessary annual subsidies,
make it impracticable. There’s
only one solution within Aus-
tralia’s present financial reach,
and that is a series of small
processing-plants strategically
placed in the inland to handle
cattle produced in each area.
Carcass-meat —or, better still,
boned and properly packaged
beef for the self-service market
—could be flown to the
nearest railhead for carriage in
refrigerated trucks to the coast.
Aircraft returning from rail-
head could carry station and
abattoir supplies direct to their
respective airfields. Cost of
constructing airfields would be
about £1 million, and the
annual subsidy for air-
transport could be kept to
£500,000.
Some types of aircraft
already available offer a direct
ton-mile cost of 6d., and there
could be more brought into
use. They wouldn’t be work-
ing in competition with exist-
ing surface-transport in the
inland—there’s virtually none
there —but they would bring
a new era to the interior. In
fact, if air-transport came into
general use the inland abat-
toirs could meet all our
domestic demands and release
a greater volume of coastal-
fattened cattle for export.
Wolseley
Shearing Machines
In 1854 Frederick York
Wolseley, brother of “Sir
Garnet” (Field-Marshal Lord
Wolseley), arrived in Australia.
Hailing from County Dublin
(Ireland), he started as a
jackeroo on Warbreccan, near
Deniliquin (N.S.W.), later
becoming a station-manager.
He began experimenting with
shearing-machines in 1867 and
by 1872 had evolved a working
model, for which he was
granted his first patent in 1877.
The original models were not
altogether successful, and H. C.
Wilson —still hale and hearty
in his 96th year, and father
of Grazcos g.-m. R. C. Wilson
—reports meeting Wolseley in
1883, when “his greatest
trouble was to get the machine
to work in any position.”
Next year, Wolseley over-
came that difficulty by use of
the universal-joint and, with
the assistance of John Howard,
who had served an apprentice-
ship with a horse-clipping
works in Birmingham (Eng.),
evolved the idea of a spring
instead of a solid centre-prong
for the fork.
A company, the Wolseley
Shearing Machine Co., Ltd.,
was formed and in a demon-
stration in Melbourne the
machine was used to run-over
blade-shorn sheep. This was
successful in producing an
extra fib. wool a sheep, and
Wolseley, pleased with this
success, then took his machine
on a barnstorming tour.
Early in 1888 Dunlop station
(N.S.W.) was equipped with
Wolseley gear. At first there
was consternation among the
shearers, who refused to sign
the agreement requiring them
to use the “newfangled fleece-
removers,” went on strike and
retired to a camp across the
Darling River. After three
weeks’ deadlock the station-
manager conceded certain

first year of machines.
Eighteen other N.S.W. sheds
were also fitted with Wolseley
machines that year, and they
were also used in Victoria (at
Fernhurst and Mount Noorat,
among other stations) and in
South Australia. In 1889
Northampton Downs (Q.)
erected 58 stands, becoming
the first big Queensland sheds
to be converted ; others quickly
followed suit.
Wolseley himself returned to
England and, in 1895, marketed
the first Wolseley motor-car —
a three-wheeler, designed by
Herbert Austin, who had met
Wolseley in Australia and who
afterwards founded the Austin
Motor Co.

machinery, the Wolseley Sheep

tralia and its re-entry into the

Dairying Outlook
[From Canberra]
“R.M.”: In its current
“Quarterly Review” the
Bureau of Agricultural Econo-
mics says the best prospect for
dairyfarmers improving sales
lies in expansion of the
domestic market, not overseas.
Australia’s rapidly growing
population would play its part,
provided the industry itself
attended to price, quality and
sales-promotion.
The bureau considers the
Dairy Produce Research and
Sales Promotion Act construc-
tive and likely to be effective
if the Dairy Produce Board
and the Dairy Produce
Research Committee receive
support and co-operation from
all sectors of the industry.
The “Review” adds that, so
far, the European Common
Market has not affected inter-
national trade in dairy-
products, because the six
member-countries are still try-
ing to formulate a common
agricultural, policy.
The report also notes that
seasonal conditions in Australia
have been more favorable than
those of last year, so produc-
tion of milk, butter and cheese
should all be above last year’s
levels. Prices for Australian
butter in the U.K. market are
now satisfactory, but with
current supplies and strong
competition from margarine,
no further improvement is to
be anticipated. Butter con-
. tinues to lose, ground to mar-
garine on the domestic market,
too, particularly in States
where supplies of table- and
industrial - margarine are
plentiful.
Death to the Dingo
“Mulga”: Queensland
graziers have suggested using
germ - warfare, like myxo-
matosis, against dingoes. A
questionnaire on the subject
from the C.5.1.R.0. has gone
to graziers throughout Aus-
tralia ; when answers come in,
something will probably be
done.
Dingoes are not as gregari-
ous as rabbits, though, so it’s
difficult to spread a disease
amongst them. Moreover, if a
virus is released, domestic and
working dogs will have to be
vaccinated against the germs.
Many methods of destruc-
tion have been tried, but none
has had any effect on the
dingo’s numbers. Aerial bait-
ing is not generally a success
because the baits, being
dropped by daylight, are often
eaten by birds before dingoes
begin to hunt, though some
dingo-pups are undoubtedly
poisoned by them. The dingo-
bonus may be raised from £1
to £2 a scalp, to encourage
more shooting of the pests.
Even in closely settled dis-
tricts dingoes now sometimes
prowl round farmhouses in
broad daylight, and sheep and
calves must be securely locked-
up at night to prevent losses.
Barrier-fences don’t always
protect flocks, and in western
Queensland many graziers
watch their sheep for the full
24 hours to keep the dingoes
off them. It’s estimated that
dingoes do £3O-million-worth
of damage to sheep and lambs
each year throughout Aus-
tralia.
Export Embargo
Before the Merino-export
embargo retards development
of our sheep and wool any
further, I think that everyone
who is interested in Australia’s
supremacy in wool-production,
and who’s not dependent on
synthetics for his income,
should do all he can to get
the embargo lifted.
Just imagine the Gilbertian
situation that would arise if
Tasmania refused to send top
sires to the mainland! If our
vets, were directed to give
health-certificates, this could
easily happen. We might also
resent the rest of the world
competing with our fat-lambs,
or we might refuse to export
our polled Dorsets.
Very few of the population
of Australia know anything
about the matter —and the
politicians, as usual, are the
most ignorant. All have votes,
though ; so why don’t they find
out the true facts of the matter,
and act on them? The Goul-
burn inquiry let a bit of fresh
air into the question of buying
and selling wool. If we had
a similar inquiry about the
embargo we might get some-
where —it might show-up the
ridiculous nonsense talked by
those who support it.
We might do this as a
memorial to Sir lan Clunies-
Ross, who did so much for
Australia’s wool and tried so
hard to get the embargo lifted.

Beating the
Backyarder
“D. Jay”: “Pieter Nuyts”
(B. 10/6/’59) takes too much
for granted, I think. I sup-
pose I’m a backyarder, because
I keep eight hens and a rooster
for home use. For the past
six years my chooks have kept
me supplied with eggs averag-
ing 6d. a dozen cheaper than
the retail price. I don’t sell
eggs, but mine are not “below
standard.”
“Backyarders,” says “P.N.,”
REPORT FROM CROHAMHURST
(2/7/’59)
Queensland may expect moderate to good rains during
August, although rainfall may be light on the Curtis
divisions and far-western and central-coast districts. Well-
distributed rains should continue for the rest of the year,
except in the far-western districts.
N.S.W. should receive moderate to good rains during
August, with best falls on the south-west slopes and Riverina,
though the South Coast may have only light rain. Well-
distributed rains should continue for the rest of the year,
with heavy rains and flooding likely in November.
Victoria should have fairly heavy general rains in
August with the heaviest in the central, north-eastern and
western divisions. Flooding is likely in the southern half
of the State, with good rains for the rest of the year.
There should be good rains in the agricultural areas of
South Australia during August, but falls may vary from
light to moderate in the Murray Valley and west-coastal
districts. Good rains should continue in the agricultural
areas during spring, but falls may be patchy in the interior
until October.
The agricultural areas of Western Australia should
have good rains in August, although rainfall may be light
and patchy elsewhere.

“are largely responsible for
swarms of houseflies” —maybe,
but my yard is kept clean, so
I have few flies, unlike some
commercial farms I have seen.
“All eggs must be infertile,”
he goes on. Then why are
so many suburbanites in
Sydney grumbling about stale
eggs? Mine are never stale ;
they are dated daily and some-
times my wife has used good
eggs two months old. The
secret is to store them upright,
with small end downwards, and
keep the container in a cool
place.
Grassing of Orchards
“H.0.H.”: Agree with “Bill-
jim” (B. 17/6/’59) on the need
for grass ; but he’s wrong in
leaving it on the surface to
dry and become a fire-danger
to the trees. It does much
more good to the trees if
worked into the soil.
The key to fruit-growing is
bacteria and these need
humus to grow in, so that they
can make plant-foods available
to the trees. Working grass
into the soil provides humus
and keeps the subsoil cool.
Also, the suface-soil is open to
absorb rainfall and is pre-
vented from being washed
away.
Avian Leucosis
“Pieter Nuyts”: “Leucosis”
is a term vaguely used to
describe poultry-diseases of a
tumorous nature, which have
various symptoms and can
affect different organs. Its two
most important forms affect
the liver and are known
amongst poultrymen as big-
liver and fowl-paralysis—both
somewhat analogous to cancer
in humans.
Big-liver and fowl-paralysis
are caused by viruses ; spread
in various ways, they usually
attack through the respiratory
tract, and infection generally
occurs during the first three
months of a bird’s life. After
that, uninfected birds attain
immunity—though this fact
may be disputed by flock-
owners whose hens are still
dying of the disease at 12
months or older. The fact is
that these diseases take time
to develop, and, while casual-
ties are probably greatest at
seven or eight months, there’ll
always be odd birds in which
infection doesn’t show until
they are comparatively old.
The point to remember is
that these birds are spreading
infection all the time. This
isn’t serious amongst the adult
birds apart from those
infected, these can be regarded
as immunised. The danger
occurs where younger birds
are permitted contact with the
older flock.
This can occur without the
birds being in the same run.
The virus is airborne and birds
in adjacent runs may suffer
through being near infected
droppings. A flyer can make
the contact even closer, and
persistent yard-breakers, how-
ever healthy they appear,
shouldn’t be tolerated. Most
poultrymen can cite cases of
adult birds succumbing to
hitherto unsuspected leucosis,
and even an uninfected bird
can carry the virus on its feet.
Virus can be transmitted
through the egg, so you’ve got
to limit all contacts as nearly
as possible to the chicks in one
pen.
An attendant —this is prob-
ably the usual agency by which
leucosis is spread through a
farm or from one farm to
another —can also carry the
virus. However carefully boots
are cleaned on leaving a run,
some infection can remain. It
only needs one of the new
chicks to become infected, and
the virus will spread through
the flock. Where there’s more
than one attendant it should
be arranged, therefore, for one
man to deal solely with the
young birds, and he should
take care to clean his boots
and clothes carefully on leav-
ing each shed or pen.
On small, one-man farms
boots and clothes should be
cleaned —if possible, changed
—on leaving the adult flocks.
This may be irksome, but pays
dividends. Whatever precau-
tions you take there’s still a
danger of leucosis; but by
keeping the danger-points
always in mind you can keep
the disease and casualties
within reasonable bounds.
Storing Apples
“Billjim”: Professor R. M.
Smock, of the N.Y. College
of Agriculture at Cornell
University, has evolved a
method of keeping apples fresh
and juicy for indefinite periods.
After harvesting, apples are
placed in a room with con-
trolled temperature. Oxygen
is reduced to 3 per cent, of
the atmosphere and carbon-
dioxide increased to 5 per cent.,
and then the room is tightly
sealed and its temperature
checked twice daily. Ageing
and consequent deterioration
are slowed by this altered pro-
portion of oxygen and carbon-
dioxide in the atmosphere.
Eelworm
“Gidgee”: Eelworm (or
nematodes) may be controlled
by injecting the ground with
a preparation containing 15
per cent, ethylene-dibromide,
which is procurable under
various trade - names from
most big fertiliser-firms at
about £1 a gallon. It’s a color-
less liquid, harmful to humans
and highly inflammable; but,
provided it’s handled carefully,
it can be used with perfect
safety.
The , ground must be
thoroughly prepared, with
large clods broken-up and all
undecayed vegetable - matter
removed. A hand-injector is
used for small areas, and the
area to be treated is marked-
off in squares 12in. by 12in.
This can be done best by draw-
ing a large board, into which
you have driven nails at 12in.
intervals, lengthwise across the
area and then at right-angles
to the first set of lines. Inject
the liquid at the points where
lines intersect in the first row,
and then in every second one.
In intervening rows the injec-
tions should be midway be-
tween the intersections, so the
holes are staggered and the
chemical therefore has more
chance of acting effectively.
As you withdraw the injector,
seal the hole with your foot.
One teaspoonful is the dose
injected, so a pint will fumi-
gate about 28 sq.-yds. For
treating larger areas there’s a
machine on the market which
can be used behind a tractor.
A simple smaller injector,
worked on the same principle
as this machine, can also be
fitted to a mouldboard-plough
or hand motor-cultivator.
Home gardens can be treated
by spot-injections. Mark the
beds, as described, then, with
a pointed stick, make holes
about N 6in. deep, and, using a
funnel (or a large oilcan with
thumb-pressure release, which
is ideal for the job), pour a
tablespoonful of the fumigant
down each hole and seal it
immediately.
Treated soil can be recon-
taminated, though eelworms
travel slowly—a few inches a
year—and there’s little likeli-
hood of reinfestation from
nearby unfumigated soil. But
you should take precautions:
all seedlings transplanted
should come from treated
plots, and tools must be
cleaned before use. Conta-
minated water is the main
source of reinfestation.
Ethylene-dibromide is toxic
to plants and germinating
seeds, so allow at least three
weeks between soil-treatment
and sowing or transplanting.
In unfavorable conditions
planting may have to be
delayed up to five months.
Follow the instructions on
the container. If you spill the
preparation on clothing, this
must be thoroughly cleaned
before you wear it again, and
boots or gloves should not be
worn again until the odor has
disappeared.

Some biographical details of the
artist Elioth Gruner ?
Born December 16, 1882, at Gis-
borne, N.Z., son of a Norwegian
father and an Irish mother, Gruner
came with his parents to Sydney
as an infant. His talent showed-
up early. At 12 he became a pupil
of Julian Ashton. At 14 he got
a job in a shop, having to help
support the family, his father and
elder brother having died. At 19
he exhibited a flower-study with the
Society of Artists, Sydney. It was
not until 15 years later that he
won the Wynne Prize with his land-
scape, “Morning Light,” which was
bought by the N.S.W. National
Gallery. He won the prize again in
1921 with his large picture, “The
Valley Of The Tweed,” which the
trustees of the Gallery had com-
missioned him to paint. In 1923 he
visited ''England and the Con-
tinent, studying famous works
of art. In 1937 he won the
Wynne Prize for the seventh
time, and gained the award for the
finest landscape exhibited that year,
with his “Weetanga.” A founda-
tion-member of the Australian
Academy of Art, Gruner was a
regular exhibitor, and also had
paintings hung at London’s Royal
Academy and the Paris Salon. The
Sydney Gallery has 20 of his paint-
ings, and others are in the Mel-
bourne, Adelaide and Brisbane Art
Galleries, and at Geelong and
Castlemaine. A bachelor, Gruner,
who it is generally considered was
Australia’s finest landscape-painter,
died at Bondi, Sydney, on October
17, 1939.

What is the origin of the phrase
“to eat humble pie’’?
Actually, the “humble” is a pun
on “umble,” umbles being the heart,
liver and entrails of the deer, which
were the huntsman’s perquisites in
olden times. When the lord of the
manor and his household dined, the
venison pasty was served on the
dais, but the umbles were made into
a pie for the huntsman and his
fellows, who were given the lower
seats.

What wus Wrenning Day ?
St. Stephen’s Day (December 26,
Boxing Day) used to be called
Wrenning Day because it was a
custom among English villagers to
stone a wren to death on that day
in commemoration of the saint’s
martyrdom. ( Brewer’s Dictionary
of Phrase and Fable.) St. Stephen
was the first Christian martyr,
accused of blasphemy and stoned
to death. (Acts vii, 58.)

Can waratahs be successfully
raised from seed ? If so, whai is
the best time of the year to do it ?,
Yes. Sow seed not later than
early May in sandy soil which
should contain plenty of grit and
charcoal. When seedlings are
strong, and big enough to handle,
transplant to pots or tins in which
there is, at bottom, crocks or stones
or pieces of charcoal to assist
drainage. Shade with twigs or tea-
tree until plants are established.
Fertilisers should be strictly avoided.
At the end of the third year they
could safely be transplanted to their
permanent places.

What events precipitated the so-
called “War of Jenkins’s Ear”?
A Spanish official in South
America named Fandino was
accused of having cut-off the ear
of Captain Jenkins, the master of
a British ship, about 1731. Jenkins
produced the ear in a bottle before
the House of Commons, and
Walpole, unable to withstand the
public outcry, and after futile
negotiations with Spain, declared
war —the War of Jenkins’s Ear.
Fandino was himself captured 11
years later by an English frigate.

New Recordings
Frankie
Sinatra’s “Love is a Kick,”
a 12in. Coronet, KLP7BS, has
12 ancient airs, including “My
Blue Heaven,” “The Con-
tinental,” “Saturday Night,”
“Five Minutes More,”
“American Beauty Rose”; all
steam-rollered through in the
master’s inimitable and only
manner. The anonymous
orchestrations have been de-
scribed by the reviewer’s son
as “real cool.”
Sinatra’s method is the
classical method ; you can hear
him, in any song, rejecting
temptations and frills that
might seem desirable to lesser
men, and ironing whatever the
song is into as near as music
can go to conversation; a
slight dogginess or wagging of
the tail is his only concession
to charm. So you get a beauti-
fully clear presentation of the
words of the song, and, maybe
because of the lack of
gimmickry, Frankie can be
tolerated a little longer than
lesser practitioners.
But as a great man in the
history of pops-singing he
may be considered to have
been lucky. His sun rose as
the great natural voice of
Crosby was setting, and he
had a good number of years
to shine before another great
natural voice rose among the
stars, singing, if one remembers
rightly, “Tutti Frutti”; more-
over, Sinatra had his day ex-
tended a further few years by

What makes a pop-tune
pop ? Why is this year’s crop
of pop-tunes different from
last year’s? Why do the pop-
tune fans of today look upon
the pop-tunes of 10 years ago
as so much pop-corn and the
pop-tunes of Poppa’s day as
something that should have
been left on the cob?
A man who should be able
to answer all these questions
and as many more on the sub-
ject as are popped-up to him
is Irving Berlin, who wrote his
first pop-tune nearly half-a-
century ago and has been
popping ’em out ever since,
It was in 1911 that Berlin’s
“Alexander’s Ragtime Band”
first reverberated round the
world, to be followed-up with
a string of ragtime successes.
In the ’twenties he was cram-
ming Broadway musicals
chockful of tuneful numbers
and in the ’thirties turning out
song-hits to keep pace with the
magic feet of Ginger Rogers
and Fred Astaire. In the post-
war ’forties he set new
standards in musicomedy with
“Annie Get Your Gun” and
as recently as 1954 scored
“White Christmas,” which out-
popped all previous screen-
musicals in box-office figures.
In its Album of Irving
Berlin (KLP7B3) Coronet has
put together a bunch of
the pop-master’s successes
garnered from 50 seasons.
“Alexander’s R. 8.” is there, of
course, and “I Got the Sun in
the Morning,” “Blue Skies,”
“Cheek to Cheek,” “It’s a
Lovely Day Tomorow,” “The
Girl That I Marry,” and a host
of others from stage- and
screen-shows, together with
“Always,” “Remember” and
other off-stage numbers that
were top-of-the-pops in their
day.
Twenty-six pieces, the lot
played by Frank de Vol and
his orchestra, blatantly, haunt-
ingly, brassily, nostalgically,
excitedly, lingeringly, as each
item demands. In all, a com-
plete explanation of Berlin’s

Brubeck
Dave Brubeck has for some
years been a leading exponent
of “cool” jazz. Cool jazz? It
is, of course, a contradiction in
terms. But, listening to the
Brubeck Quartet at work on
“Sometimes I’m Happy” and
“Le Souk,” on Coronet KEP
173, you see what the fans
meant when they pinned the
adjective to his music.
A former pupil of Darius
Milhaud, Brubeck is scholarly,
restrained and technically im-
peccable. Blowing-in after the
heat of the Gillespie-Parker
years, he must have excited in
the way an evening southerly
excites Sydney in summer. He
puts shape and direction into
jazz, and if he doesn’t take
all the cliches out he packages
them so neatly that you’d
hardly know them.
But he has also taken out
much of the fierce abandoned
poetry of the “hot” years,
tending too often to work on
the music from the outside. In
“Sometimes I’m Happy,” for
instance, you have his group
affectionately patronising an
evergreen gentling it into
different shapes, leading it up
and down their clever key-
changes and progressions and
setting it unregretfully aside.
All very nice, but it doesn't
send you far.
The best Brubeck on this
disk is in his own composition,
“Le Souk.” It has a certain
technical fierceness, especially
in Brubeck’s piano break ; but
even here you feel that he’s
merely displaying what he
learnt from Milhaud. One of
the best incidental effects on
this side comes from the
Brubeck fans —that slapping, as
of hands or dancing feet, that
sometimes breaks out in unison
with the drum and double-bass.

Under a portrait of Queen Elizabeth
surmounted by a large Union Jack was
set the official table when members of
the Royal Commonwealth Society held
their monthly luncheon in the Lower
Town Hall. The president, Lieut.-
General Sir Horace Robertson, received
the guests, among whom were Sir John
Latham, Lady White, Mrs. Claude
Couchman (she is senior vice-president of
the Victoria branch), Mr. and Mrs.
R. F. G. Fogarty (her frock and match-
ing jacket were in turquoise-blue wool,
and her small black feather-hat had a
brilliant dash of turquoise feather in
front of the tiny brim), Geelong branch
president J. M. Macintyre and his wife,
Mr. and Mrs. Tristan Buesst, Brigadier
R. Tovell and Mrs. H. G. Connell. The
guest-speaker was the High Commissioner
for the Union of South Africa, Mr.
A. M. Hamilton, who was accompanied
to the luncheon by Mrs. Hamilton.

For the Black Mantilla dance, held to
assist the hospital’s building-fund, the
decorations-committee of the St. Vincent’s
Hospital Younger Set effectively turned
the Royale Ballroom into a Spanish
town-square. In the centre of the ball-
room was a three-tiered fountain with
a vase of mixed flowers; multicolored
fairylights circled the ballroom, and
from the ceiling amusing clown-faces
gazed down. On individual tables old
wine-bottles held lighted candles. Presi-
dent Laurence Hodgkinson greeted the
official guests, among them Mr. and Mrs.
E. W. R. Grace (he is secretary of St.
Vincent’s Hospital) ; Margaret Bolton
(who wore a short frock of powder-blue
silk taffeta and matching French re-
embroidered lace); Denise Hart (wearing
a gown of silver-grey faille with the full
skirt caught-up in front, and with multi-
colored silk roses trimming the hem);
Cherry Borthwick (whose lovely gown
and stole were in pale-pink silk-faille
patterned in muted flowers); and Cap-
tain David Hertford-Jones (A.D.C. to
the Governor).
The dancers included Sandra Robin-
son (wearing a gown of orchid-pink
satin) ; Patricia Gregory (whose gown of
filmy white tulle had a three-tiered skirt) ;
Barbara Maher (her frock was of old-
gold satin) ; and Joelle McMahon (whose
tangerine faille gown was strapless, the
skirt full and graceful).

Her many friends are showering con-
gratulations on popular Cherry Cupit,
who has just announced her engagement.
Cberry is the eldest daughter of Mr. and
Mrs. ‘George Cupit, of Toorak, and her
fiance is Sidney James, only son of the
late Mr. and Mrs. D. J. Franklin,
formerly of Launceston, Tasmania. The
wedding is planned for early next year.
Among parties to celebrate it will be one
given by Jenny Stratmann and Angela
Wawn at Angela’s Toorak home;
Cherry’s parents will give another next
month after Sidney returns from a
business-trip to Queensland. Cherry is
weating a solitaire-diamond ring.
Mrs. Lionel Newton, of South Yarra,
is a woman who believes that to be
happy one must have a full life. For
some years she was an honorary car-
driver for the Melbourne District Nurs-
ing Society, to the Jessie Henderson
Auxiliary of which she belonged. She
is a member of the South Yana branch
of Y.W.C.A. and of the Australian-
American Association, and belongs to a
small group of women, headed by Mrs.
Ronald Nott, who work independently
raising money throughout the year and
donating it to one special charity. One
delightful way in which Mrs. Newton
assists organisations is to give luncheons
at her lovely Mt. Macedon home. Noted
for the elegance of her ensembles, Mrs.
Newton has one daughter, Mrs. Verna
Linton (who is an interior-decorator), and
two grandchildren, Sally Anne and
Mary Lou.
Vice-Admiral Henry Burrell came from
Canberra to attend the Navy League
dinner-ball at the Royale Ballroom, pro-
ceeds of which will swell the funds of
the Sea Cadet Corps. A white-and-
silver decor was used. In the foyer
were two huge urns filled with all-white
flowers: gladioli, stock, lilies and
camellias; in the ballroom were urns
filled with white frosted hydrangeas and
painted white leaves. A huge badge of
the Navy League on a dark backdrop was
set behind the official table, which was
draped with a navy cloth and highlighted
with several huge silver candelabra.
Ball-committee president Mrs. Arthur
Laver and Mr. Laver, and Navy League
president Captain A. N. Boulton and
Mrs. Boulton, received the official guests.
Mrs. Laver’s lovely gown was of pale-
pink satin patterned in deep-rose flowers ;
Mrs. Boulton’s sheath-gown was of rose-
pink embroidered with silver motifs.
In the official party were Rear-Admiral
and Mrs. A. Harrington (she wearing a
gown of white satin-brocade); Rear-
Admiral and Mrs. Charles Clarke (her
gown was of powder-blue moire-taffeta);
and Captain and Mrs. George Fowle.
In Captain and Mrs. John Williams’s
party were Sir ,Henry and Lady Wells
and Sir Frank and Lady Selleck. Mr
and Mrs. John Casson were in the party
of Mrs. D. F. R. Evans, who was in
charge of decorations. Mrs. Claudia
Creswick, Mrs.. Geoff Wharton and Mrs
James Buchanan handled liquid refresh-
ments.

In her talk to members of the Vic-
toria League about her visit to the U.S.
and Canada Mrs. Isobel Green told of
meeting a young man who, after dis-
covering she was an Australian, asked
her if she knew Robert Gordon Menzies.
When Mrs. Green said the Prime Minis-
ter was her brother the young man at
first looked sceptical, but on being con-
vinced said, “Well, my name is Paul
Gordon Menzies” —and then followed a
great delving into family connections.
Members afterwards agreed that Mrs.
Green has also inherited the Menzies
gift of knowing how to use words.
Mrs. Green, who looked attractive
in a full coat of sapphire - blue
velvet and matching velvet hat, was
greeted by senior vice-president Mrs. Guy
Bakewell and vice-presidents Mrs. Robert
Hamilton and Mrs. Frank May (the
latter, with her husband, leaves shortly
for a holiday in New Guinea).

The Younger Members’ Group of the
English Speaking Union will hold its
third July Rendezvous —in the form of
a dinner-dance —at Ciro’s on the 24th
to aid its Travelling Scholarship Fund.
Decorations, in a French theme, will be
in pink, black, white and gold. There
will be hand-painted menus in black and
gold on a pink background ; gay posters
emphasising French cooking, wines,
fashions and poodles will adorn the walls.
Jack White, a committee-member, has
made a larger-than-life French poodle in
white metal with jewelled eyes and pink
feet. Sue Devereux, Gay Horton and
George Carrington will do the decora-
tions. Ticket-secretaries (tickets are two-
guineas each) are Anne Dixon (WY4108),
Mrs. Andrew Hardie (LW4957), Gay
Horton (8X7023) and Patricia Whykes

Icy winds swept down on the city
through the week (no powder in the
world could whiten our pink-tinged
noses) and brought such bleak conditions
that— warmth and home became the
favorite words in any language, and the
thought of anyone being without such
essentials gave more than usual interest
to work of welfare organisations and
their money-raising plans.

The Sir Eric Woodward,
and Lady Woodward attended the annual
meeting of the Family Welfare Bureau,
and when saying some nice things about
its work his Excellency assured listeners
that he knew more about the seamy
side of life than they would imagine,
and that many of the problems of which
he had heard and read were not always
caused by poverty. No Government
could tackle these as successfully as the
bureau was doing, he added, for they
needed personal attention and a great
understanding, which could only be
given by such an organisation, in which
so many people were cheerfully giving
up their time to help.
The meeting was chaired by Mr. Cyril
Docker, when bureau-president Mrs.
C. J. Pope (“the life-blood of the bureau”)
was unable to be present because of
family illness. Cheques were handed in ;
Wahroonga branch by its president, Mrs.
R. Wood; Castle Hill by secretary-
treasurer Mrs. G. Sargent, and the
Women’s Auxiliary (of which Mrs. Pope
is president) by its treasurer, Miss Laing.
Membership in the Wahroonga branch
has increased to 20 ; its secretary is Mrs.
Donald Coburn and treasurer Mrs. R.
Armati. With only 10 of them, Castle
Hill branch really earned its money by
the tireless efforts of its members, mostly
directed to the running of street-stalls.
The Women’s Auxiliary has a large
membership and raised £2170 during the
year, mostly from its Bargain Shop,
which is staffed by voluntary helpers and
collectors.

were used in dishes at the party given
by Dr. and Mrs. Norman Hing after the
christening of their baby son, Norman
Richard. Among the many friends who
helped celebrate the occasion (and
admired the baby, sleeping peacefully all
through the party) were his godparents,
Mrs. James McKeon and Mr. J. Duggan ;
Mr. and Mrs. Ben Chechik; Mr. and

The charm and elegance of a crinoline
was a feature of the dressing which
made the current Tivoli show one of
the most spectacular. In “The Diamond
Horseshoe” are four English sisters, who
dress alike both on and off stage. Indi-
cations that Sydney can be nippy in its
weather are given when the four Gibson
girls don their thick hand-knitted jumpers
(thoughtfully made for them by their
mother before they left England for
sightseeing trips). The quartet, whose
ages range from 24 to 18 —with two years’
difference between each sister were
born on a dairyfarm near Bristol, where
their parents still live. A gift for
harmonising-singing made them decide to
choose the theatre as their careers instead
of the farm. First-nighters included
Major and Mrs. P. Manly, Mr. and Mrs.
Sam Hodson, the Martin Wangs and
Mr. and Mrs. Charles Moses.
Barbara Eather, the younger daughter
of Mr. Harold Eather, of Canberra, plays
the part of Julie Gillis in “The Tender
Trap,” which opened at the Pocket Play-
house, Sydenham, on Saturday night for
an eight-week season. The youthful
actress will be remembered in a very
different role in the Australian film
“Smiley Gets a Gun,” in which s he
appeared with Dame Sybil Thorndike
as her granddaughter. After living in
New York for most of her earlier school-
days, Barbara returned to Australia with
her family and made her first stage-
appearance with the Canberra Repertory
Society. When not busy with rehearsals
(she is well known to both TV and radio
audiences), Barbara laves to get away to
the country for a weekend. She is a
very keen horsewoman and swimmer.
Colorful decorations and glamorous
dressing were features of the ball at the
Royal Motor Yacht Club on Saturday
night, when a guard-of-honor was formed
by Sea Scouts for the Governor and Lady-
Woodward, who were received by Com-
modore and Mrs. F. G. Lender, Mr. and
Mrs. Buckley and Mr. and Mrs. Bill
White —Mrs. White is the very active
president of the social-committee of the
Royal N.S.W. Institution for Deaf and
Blind Children (which will benefit from
the function). She looked charming in a
floral-satin dress in the peacock-line.
Mrs. Lender’s mist-grey chiffon dress
was full-length and caught at the back
with a large pink rose. Mrs. Buckley was
in pervenche-blue lace. Another striking
gown was worn by Mrs. Eve Pointing,
secretary of the club’s lady associates —
of bronze satin, it had Dior embroidery
of pearls and sequins on the bodice.
Rear-Admiral and Mrs. D. H. Harries
and Superintendent of Police W. E.
Salmon and Mrs. Salmon were also in
the official party.
There were many gay parties around
the tables, where decorations of large
golden balloons and gilded foliage
brought many complimentary remarks
to those responsible. With Major and
Mrs. J. D. Westwood were her son and
daughter-in-law, Mr. and Mrs. Douglas
Mawer. (They were married only
recently, she, from Perth, being the
daughter of Dr. John Gollan). Com-
modore and Mrs. Victor Everson made
a special trip from their North Coast
home to attend, and enthusiastically gave
account of the 18-footers flying-
squadron (of which he is commodore),
which also raises money for the same
cause. An outstanding gown was worn
by Mrs. Dell Alldritt; it was of black
velvet, with a deep cuff of white ermine
on the strapless bodice. Of jacaranda
chiffon appliqued with guipure-lace was
the dress worn by Mrs. K. Henry, who
was accompanied by her husband.
Noted also among the dancers were
Mr. and Mrs. Geoffrey See ; Mrs. Wini-
fred Mawer ; Mr. S. Kroupa ; Mr. and
Mrs. E. O. Thomas ; Mrs. Dun Cullen
(in peacock-blue taffeta made with draped
bodice and bouffant skirt); Mr. and Mrs.
Morton Cohen; Mr. and Mrs. Jack
Hilton ; Mrs. L. Tidmarsh (her dress was
of cognac-satin with pearl-embroidered
bodice); Mrs. Peacock-Smith (committee-
treasurer), who wore an aubergine-satin
dress with pale-mauve accessories; Mrs.
Ron McDonald (deep-blue topped the
bodice of her ribbon-striped organdie
dress); Miss May Dunn (whose full-
length black chiffon skirt had a white
guipure-lace top ; Mrs. Alan Graham and
Mrs. Beril Jents.

Even if many of our Australian house-
wives who have an outside job occa-
sionally feel they should rebel against
'the necessity of carrying home stacks of
provisions in packhorse - style, they
wouldn’t get much sympathy in Russia,
where a common scene is grey-haired
women in road-gangs operating pneu-
matic-drills or working as street-
cleaners. This was a sight Mrs. Richard
Woolcott said she found hard to get used
to when she lived in Russia, where she
went as a bride in 1952. She had met
her husband, an expert in Russian
linguistics, in London. They had almost
two years together in Russia, and then
were expelled with other Australian
diplomatic families in 1954. Mrs.
Woolcott left with her husband and
their three small children to again make
their home in Moscow, where Mr. Wool-
cott, as Second Secretary, will help
reopen the Australian Embassy.


attempts to disentangle Elizabeth’s real
feelings after she has signed the
warrant; and English readers will find
it hard to swallow his theory that
Leicester engineered the meeting
because he was secretly in love with
Mary. But, because it does reveal the
essential truth of the situation between
the two queens, or some of it, the
meeting remains a valid piece of stage-
craft and. with Mary at first trying to
be humble but bursting out into rage,
a most dramatic one. Except that
Mary might well have been made less
rhetorical and more explicit in the final
tongue-lashing she gives Elizabeth, the
scene is well handled by Spender.
The Old Vic production and the
publication of this version may well,
as Spender hopes, bring Schiller (and
with him a considerable body of
German drama by other writers) to the
contemporary English stage; but, from
the literary point of view, there remains
the question, what is Schiller’s play,
as he wrote it, really like? And how
would “The Robbers” read today?
Fresh and complete translations of
these works are surely long overdue.
A Swedish Symphonist
Someone once said of Hummel, the
German pianist, that he (or his musical
activity) was like a chocolate in a mud-
pool: perfectly all right, but everyone
left it where it was. One might almost
make the same comment about Franz
Berwald, except that Robert Layton
has. as it were, taken a header into the
mud-pool and rescued his subject. The
result is a tidy little book called Franz
Berwald (1796-1868): a Critical Study
of the 19th-Century Swedish Sym-
phonist, published by Anthony Blond
under the auspices of the Anglo-
Swedish Literary Foundation.
The book divides broadly into two
sections, the first setting-out the
Berwald genealogical tree: straight-
forward biography up to the third
chapter, when Franz has negotiated
adolescence and, as a man, is starting
to compose. From this point the writing
loses much of its necessary dryness;
the swing is towards Berwald’s com-
posing style. This does not mean, of
course, that Franz immediately ceases
to be a human-being and becomes an
object of intense dissection: there is
an intriguing bit about his work as an
orthopaedic surgeon, and Layton
inclines to the view that, although
“quackery was abundant in the medi-
cal profession at this time,” Berwald
was “a practitioner of the greatest
skill.”
Later chapters in the book are
authoritative if sometimes wordy. In
the chapter titled “Structure” it is
mildly alarming to discover the fol-
lowing: “Insofar as the subtraction of
part of a human organism can have
deleterious or even fatal results, an
analogous excision carried out in an
organic symphony is fraught with
similar consequences.” In other words,
don’t fool about with the guts of a
symphony. '
A really fine calendar, taking in
contemporary musicians and events,
and a comprehensive list of Berwald’s
works (and he can only be described
as prolific) supplement the text.
The Dunkirk Legend
Directly the evacuation started
Dunkirk became a legend and —like
most military legends—grew more dis-
torted the further it spread. So it is
a relief to find David Divine’s excellent
The Nine Days of Dunkirk (Faber)
putting the whole operation into true
perspective. From a study of all avail-
able information and with personal
experience in the “little ships,” Divine
is in a position to explode a number
of myths allowed to gain currency
simply because no one was able to
refute them with authority.
Covering the entire campaign and
its political background, this survey
is important because it assigns honors
where they are due. Divine proves
that it was Lord Gort, not Brooke,
who saved the B.E.F. in the land-
fighting. As regards the naval opera-
tions, it was Admiral Ramsay’s
meticulous planning and organisation
rather than the “miraculous” appear-
ance of a fleet of yachts and motor-
boats which was responsible for ferry-
ing 338.226 men of the Allied forces
back to England. Both Gort and
Ramsay died before their prowess
could be properly recognised. The
picture which survived was of an
un-co-ordinated retreat saved by the
forceful action of a corps-commander
and of a makeshift sortie by weekend
yachtsmen to bring the remnants of
a defeated army across the Straits of
Dover. This is shown to be false in
every particular.
When he summarises the points of
view of all nations engaged, the author
describes the German failure to achieve
their object as a consequence of mili-
tary indecision. The High Command
had not yet accepted the new
philosophy of war, so the speed and
depth of the first break-through filled
them with apprehension and, doubting
the possibility of such success, they had
no plan for immediate further use of
the armored columns once they had
reached the sea. Von Rundstedt, com-
manding Army Group A, which was
knocked off its balance by the well-
handled British armor at Arras, halted
his armor on the morning of May 23,
and this standstill order, later con-
firmed by Hitler, gave Gort the time
he needed to consolidate his piecemeal
defence. The Luftwaffe, expending the
greater part of its effort on the town
and docks at Dunkirk and on the line
of the dunes and beaches, failed,
through misappreciation of the strength
and weaknesses of sea-power, to con-
centrate from the first on the shipping.
The reason for German naval failure
was that, owing to their losses at
Narvik, there were no warships in
home-bases which could be spared for
co-operation with the attack in the
West. “The blame for the German
failure is shared by all three Services.
Its consequences were to be decisive.
It was an opportunity thrown away.”
With regard to the Belgian effort
and King Leopold’s “betrayal” of the
Allies, the author points out that
“three full days before Leopold sent
his emissaries to ask Bock for terms
Gort had ‘written-off’ the Belgians.”
The King’s decision to capitulate was
taken 24 hours after Operation
“Dynamo” (the evacuation) had
begun.
The collapse of the French Army
he blames primarily on Petain,
Gamelin and Weygand —“Petain who
directed French policy to the defensive,
Gamelin who readied the armies of
France for war and directed the open-
ing of the campaign on the basis of
that policy. Weygand who commanded
the final debacle.”
Gamelin’s supreme confidence that
the Germans had played into his hand
when they launched their attack on
May 10 was shattered four days later
when Corap’s Ninth Army “faded
away.” From then on it was a ques-
tion of panic-measures: Weygand,
recalled from Beirut, was offered the
post of Supreme Commander on the
afternoon of May 19 and accepted it
that evening. May 19 was the day of
crisis in the campaign, and on that
day no positive action was taken in
Weygand’s name. The author sums-
up: “It is difficult to find in the conduct
of the northern campaign from May
19 until the end of the evacuation one
concrete consequence of Weygand’s
assumption of command... .yet in fair-
ness to him it must be stressed that he
inherited an all but impossible situa-
tion When he took over the
Supreme Command the front was
already shattered and no reserves
existed with which to repair the
breach. His inheritance was impot-
ence.”
Discussing the British achievement,
the author does not consider the
R.A.F. held the qualitative superiority
they claimed over Dunkirk and later


gained during the Battle of Britain.
Examining this question, he says:
“Fighter Command lost 106 aircraft.
The first official claims issued by the
Air Ministry [for German aircraft
destroyed] totalled 390. A meticulous
examination of captured German
records after the war showed that the
total German loss for the period in
question on all parts of the front was
156 aircraft. Nineteen of these were
known to have been destroyed in fight-
ing over other parts of the front and
five were lost to other causes. The
Dunkirk total was therefore reduced
to 132.” Although he admits that
“qualitative superiority does not neces-
sarily rest upon a profit-and-loss
account,” Divine is of the opinion that
the R.A.F. misjudged the German air-
strength available over Dunkirk and
in consequence tended to exaggerate
their own achievements.
Incisive in his opinions but com-
pletely accurate over facts, hard-
hitting but always fair, David Divine
has produced a work of historical
importance which has the additional
advantages of being clear and easy to
read.
R. G.
Oxford and the R.N.
A brief review of James Pattinson’s
novel Contact Mr. Delgado in B.
17/6/’59, which mentioned that the
hero had “performed the surprising
feat of going from Oxford University
into the Royal Navy,” so moved a
“Bulletin” reader in Newcastle, N. S.
Wales, that he sent a telegram asking
“Why ‘surprising’?”
“The Bulletin” is sorry to have left
him so long in his agony of mystifica-
tion, but the reviewer’s reply was really
too long and complex to wire back.
Here it is:—
Why is it surprising for a man to
go from Oxford University into the
Royal Navy? Because it’s pretty well
impossible. The R.N. likes to catch its
fighting-officers young. So Harvey
Landon, if he’d really been in the war-
time R.N., would normally have joined
as a cadet at Dartmouth, aged 12 or
13; he might have been accepted as
“special entry” at 18—but never at 22
or 23. If he’d joined as_a rating after
his uni.-course he could hardly have
reached his ultimate rank in the time he
reputedly did.
A few N.O’s used to go to Cambridge
for a short course, but they went there
as lieutenants or lieut.-commanders, after
they’d joined and come up the ladder in
the orthodox way.
The R.N.V.R. is a different kettle of
fish; but it’s the R.N. that’s in question
here.
Reviewed Briefly
Seven Chose Murder: Roy Vickers
(Faber). The Department of Dead-
ends proves nemesis to the wrong-doer
in these seven stories which are already
known to many readers of mystery
magazines. All are competently
written, the weakest being about the
sweet-natured gold-digger whose ex-
lovers meet on board a luxury yacht,
one of them murdering her. The
most interesting is about the high-
principled girl who marries her friend’s
killer in order to reform him.
* * * *
A Family Affair: Roger Eddy
(Macdonald). A commercial success-
story set in upper-middle-class Ameri-
can society. Mildly satirical on the
subject of matriarchial sway, it is com-
petent and readable but lacks vigor.
* * * #
A Gap in the Spectrum: Marilyn
Duckworth (New Authors, Ltd.). A
young girl awakens in a lodging-house
in London, unaware of who she is and
ignorant of the country in which she
finds herself. Her home is in a place
called “Micald,” where the customs
are very different, but how she came
to be transported, she does not know.
The idea has possibilities for mystery
or for satire, but the reader finds before
long that it is simply a “gimmick” to
dress-up the very ordinary adventures
of one of the many girls from New
Zealand and Australia who go to seek
their fortunes in England.
* * * *
Dominant Third: Elizabeth Hely
(Heinemann). A perceptive study of
mind and personality in relation to
murder and its detection. Unfortun-
ately it resembles a mystery and is
therefore weakened in its impact
because it does not stick to the various
unwritten rules governing detective-
stories. There is no mystery, really,
and the murderer no motive that
bears any relation to the particular
situation. Judged as a thriller, it is
more successful.
TRAVELLERS
Travellers l have entertained, dismayed
often
that 1 was clubfooted, lame of spirit. Men
of no address who seem adventurous
because
we do not know tnem, long, before their
loss
is ours; their absence seems our own. We
stay
behind while they are ever going, going
away.
And what they see we cannot see; and see
our loss through their eyes, magnified. We
of the hometown to whom they wander
back ;
sometimes homesick, it’s said, at times.
“You, Jack,
you ought to travel, too. You go away,
the town will think you’re somebody,”
they say.
But l have never gone; have taken a
look,
latterly, at some whom I thought took
the guise of hero; lax in discernment of
character, too ready to bow to those who
scoff
at the parochial.
For, one day, I felt the wind
reel on the Post Office corner, the blind
wind that blunders into posts drunkenly
with the rain
that comes and goes: both off some
rumbling train
heard over tin township - roofs. /
remember,
in childhood, the months that end with
“ ’ember”
and “ ’ary,” the pair would come, regu-
larly blown
by the Trades full tilt upon our town.
Then little dogs would drown their ears
in pools;
and, paddling home in gutters from the
schools,
Convent and State child met; and, which
got wet,
would draw from mothers, each, some
blasphemous threat,
the rain being forgotten, except by us
leaving to our parents the extraneous fuss.
—The rain, huge and munificent; but
dampening now,
which seldom comes but what it brings
in tow
mysterious footprints ... or, is it our
nerves fray,
wishing this traveller upon his way ?
And summer . . . winter . . . these go
round the world . . .
with day and night . , . all, all the
travellers, snarled
in a traffic of years. Only an old man
stays,
has never left our town; and in these
days
of rocket and ’plane, l sit with him, alone,
my face and his becoming more like stone
at which the travellers stare, perhaps,
thinking:
‘‘The old man has seen life. See him
blinking
with age at the little light that's left to
his pale eyes.
He sits with age, alone; and where he’s
been
would try the most adventurous of us :
old man —if only we could see what he
has seen.”
