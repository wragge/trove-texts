My blessing and remembrance on the breeze !
Purple of bloom, gold-dusted atmosphere,

With love and longing yet my heart remembers

Art and the Critics
The largest and simplest terms in common
use have always evaded definition. In spite
of the flood of talk around it and about,
there is no agreement amongst professors or
practitioners as to what is Art. Art criticism
needs a new vocabulary. The word “ art ”
covers such a multitude of sins that artistic
virtue is made cheap. The term is applied
loosely to anything which is the handiwork
of man, and, in a more restricted sense, to
any such handiwork which seems beautiful.
Beauty itself dodges definition, and changes
with time and place, so there is ample room
for lively disagreement. One set of persons,
speaking with, authority, declare that apt
must have a moral purpose, and Tolstoy, the
inspired anarchist, tried to blow up the re-
putations of - some world-famous artists
because their work offended his Puritanical
nose. According to another set, that alone
is art which is beautifully useless, from the
kangaroos, as seen through the temperament
of the aboriginal cock-carver, to the llokeby
“Venus.” The world gets along somehow
without knowing exactly what art is.
From time to time persons arise who pro-
claim the superlative merits of this artist or
that, and their word is accepted according to
the force of their dogmatism. One man who
gained a hearing shouted “Turner” at the
British public until its leaders came to
admire paintings previously unnoticed. One
set of critics swear by all that is Botticelli.;
to another the Impressionists are anathema.
One coterie upholds the Dutch school;
another the Dago. You pay yourraoney and
take your choice—of critics.
* # * *
That elegant dilettante, Arthur J. Balfour,
delivered a lecture last year on Criticism and
Beauty , which has been re-written and pub-
lished by the Clarendon Press, Oxford.
From an ultra-aristocrat it is surprising to
find such an abandonment of the aristocratic
doctrine of art as he makes here. Criticism,
he says, applies with authority only to the
matter of technical dexterity. Beyond that
there is nothing fixed, there are no universal
standards, and each man is a law unto himself
so far as aesthetic pleasure is concerned. And
this in fact has always been so. Men of
“trained sensibility” differ from the mob and
d iffe r among the msel ves. j udgmen ts
are for the most part immediate, and so to
speak, intuitive. Their difference depends
upon the fineness of the judge’s nature, but
the judgment of Jones is not valid for Brown
or Smith, who may be of coarser nature.
Nor are there any positive factors for the
production of art. Every variety of “ism ”
and religion and attitude to life “have in-
spired or helped to inspire the creators of
artistic beauty :
I can find no justification in experience for
associating' great art with penetrating insight or
good art with morals.
This endorsement of the democratic view
of art has disturbed some of the orthodox
critics, but it is no more than an extension
of the right of private j udgment. The public
will make mistakes in trying to find its own
way.; but in art as in religion, Tom Hood’s
lines apply :
My heart ferments not with the bigot’s leaven.
All creeds I view with toleration thorough,
And have a horror of reaching heaven
As anybody’s rotten borough.
T. Sturge Moore wrote a good deal of
verse before he devoted himself to the
criticism of artists such as Durer and Cor-
reggio. He has attempted in Art and Life
(Methuen) to get at some guiding principles
in relation to art in general, and for this pur-
pose he has taken the \yorks of Flaubert and
Blake. The first stands for the French type at
its strongest and the artist of infinite pains :
“In Blake the English presumption of a
God-illumined judgment reached its acme of
assurance, no writer of the same force has
deviated from initial impulse so little, or
gathered less from experience and observa-
tion.”
The study of Flaubert is an exhaustive
one. The conflicting criticism on the man
and on each of his books is set forth, then
some samples of his prose, and finally Moore
endeavors to extract from the novels and
correspondence a statement of Flaubert’s
views on art :
Art’s functions were for Flaubert as for all
great masters, the evocation, development and
perpetuation of beauty. If you asked him to
define, he replied by telling you what beauty did
for him. ... “Beauty is that by which I am
vaguely exalted.”
“There, that is poetry as I love it—tranquil
and crude as nature without asingle striking idea,
and every line of which opens an horizon to set
you musing all a day long.”
“The most beautiful works are those with
least substance; the nearer expression comes to
thought the more closely the word fastens upon
it and disappears into it, the more beauty
there is.”
“ The prime quality in art is illusion ; emotion
often obtained by certain sacrifices of poetic
detail is an altogether different thing. I have
wept at melodramas which were not worth two-
pence, and Goethe has never moistened my eye
unless it has been with admiration.”
Flaubert’s advice that the artist should
“ never fear to be exaggerated—all the very
great have been so,” is compared with
Blake’s maxims, “ Exuberance is beauty ”
and 1 ‘ The road of excess leads to the palace
of wisdom.” Blake, however, was not con-
cerned with nature, but with visions, and
Flaubert, who was closer to earth, added :
“In order that the exaggeration may not
shock it must be everywhere constant, pro-
portional, in harmony with itself.” In brief,
the essentials are exuberance and harmony—
emotion and technique.
Sturge Moore fails to give any definite
conclusions about either Flaubert or Blake
which would be of much value to the reader;
nor does his enthusiasm become contagious,
for it fails to get through his turbid prose.
An artist will derive profit from the opinions
of Flaubert, who, for 20 years, wrestled
with words an d agonised over phrases. ” The
virtue of the book is in these suggestive
opinions and in the correlation of two such
apparently opposite types as Flaubert and
Blake.”

One of the best-known art critics in
America is James Huneker. In attempt-
ing to range over all the arts he cannot be
profound anywhere ; but as no man has ever
got to the bottom of art, a skilful skater over
a wide surface is of more value to the public
of the moment than a diver who has tried
to g<> deep and has not come back. His
latest book — Promenades of an Impressionist
(Sydney Book Club)-—contains essays on
Rodin, Degas, Cezanne, Rops, the French
Impressionists, half a dozen black-and-white
artists, various European galleries, and some
minor matters. It shows a wide knowledge
of pictures and books about painters.
He knows all the authorities and gives a
digest of them for the reader. On Watteau,
for instance, he follows Mauclair in declar -
ing-that the ethereal delicacy of his painting
was due to disease :
These flights into these azure, the evocations of
a country west of the sun and east of the moon,
these graceful creatures of Watteau, the rioh
brocade of Chopin’s harmonies, the exquisite pic-
tures of Keats, the youthful joy in far-away
countries of Stevenson, all. all are so many stig-
mata of their terrible affliction (consumption).
They sought by the magic of their art to create a
realm of enchantment, a realm wherein their
ailing bodies and wounded spirits might find
peace and solace.
The difficulty of conveying impressions in
words has led him to emulate the style of
Henley, who wrote of Monticelli—“his
fairy meadows and enchanted gardens are
that sweet word, ‘Mesopotamia,’ in two
dimensions,” and spoke of his “clangors of
bronze and gold and scarlet.” Huneker has
many sentences like this : “We may say of
the Spanish painter, Joaquin Sorolla y
Bastida, that he was one of those who came
into the world with a ray of sunshine in
their brains—altering a phrase of Yilliers
d l’lsle Adam.” The poverty-stricken state
of the art critic’s vocabulary compels him to
write of one art in terms of another, and
draw upon several languages for phrases to
express fine shades. Thus: “It must
not be supposed that because of Sorolla’s
enormous brio his general way of entrapping
nature is brutal. He is masculine and abso-
lutely free from the neurasthenic morbidezza
of his fellow-countryman, Zuloaga.”
That is the Huneker method at its worst.
At its best, it provides a' bright and readable
account of each man’s work, bristling with
quotations from the specialists, and is useful
to anyone who wishes to get a rapid and
capable summary of what the respective
artists have done.
It is frank impressionism by a well-trained
observer. Most newspaper criticism of
art is the impressionism of ignorance tem-
pered with authority. No critic of to-day is
in doubt about the superiority of, say,
Raphael to Albert Moore. How many
critics in Australia can measure the per-
formance of Lambert or Norman Carter
against that of Sargeant or anyone else of
similar standing ? If a Ruskin were to arise
here he might persuade Australians that
they had an inglorious Turner in their midst.
(Of course, this is a wild hypothesis; but
Melba was discovered to be a star of the first
magnitude after she had left Australia.)
* * * *
Art in N.S.W. is officially recognised by
the State. It is one of the minor sub-sections
of the Department of Education aud probably
the least troublesome. The Art Gallery,
with its annual vote, has occasionally pro-
vided a little disturbance ; but only a few
people are actively interested, and no votes
depend upon the kind of pictures purchased.
Art is also encouraged by the payment of
a subsidy of £4OO a year to au Art Society.
There was a time when there was only one
society of the kind. Now there ai'e several,
and with the Spring come their exhibitions.
Not long ago the Women Painters had theirs
in a badly-lit room in Sydney. At present
the subsidised society is holding its show in
a room which is not well lit, hut is the best
of the kind in Sydney. The other societies
asked for a loan of this room and were
refused.
A deputation from the Society of Artists
waited on the Minister for Education and
asked him to compel the subsidised society
to allow other societies to use the room, or
get the Government to build a room suitable
for exhibitions, and let each society use it.
Instead of helping one Art Society, why
should not the Government spend the capital
value of the subsidy in helping art ? The
Minister for Enlightenment did not venture
beyond his depth, but stood on the solid
rock of vested interest. “ Here is a society
with its president and its secretary and its
rubber stamp. It is the oldest in the State,
The subsidy was originally granted without
conditions. Why disturb the existing order
of things ? ” And he waved the refractory
artists away.
The proposal of the Society of Artists,
that if the State spends any money in help-
ing artists to exhibit their work, it should
put all artists on the same footing, is a
reasonable one. The interests of the public
would best be served by providing a gallery
in which pictures from all the societies could
be exhibited at stated intervals. That would
give a fair chance to every shade of artistic
expression. And artists would have a better
chance of selling their wares. The Govern-
ment should do more than this, hut this
will do for the present.
There is money in sentimental songs; not
much, perhaps, but considering the kind of soul-
ful ditty which is popular, it should be a lucrative
side line for any ink-slinger who can rise to the
pure bathetic. Here is one which has been pub-
lished by W. H. Paling and Co., Ltd. It is
called Lore’s Divine (whatever that may mean),
and it was written and composed by J. O. Schupp:
Do you still remember,
The hour when first we met,
With joyous friends together,"
Fond hearts at love’s request ?
While sighing waves of ocean,
The boat glides swiftly on.
Oh! this day we’ve never,
Never came to roam ;
Oh ! this day we’ve never,
Never came to roam.
Chorus.
All my heart was loving;
Loving heart of thine,
. Yet so fondly dreaming.
Of my love divine.
Do you still remember, ,
Standing hand-in-hand,
When the boat did enter,
Close magnetic land ?
Time came soon for parting,
The anchor cast ashore.
Oh! this day could never,'
Never more adore.
Oh ; this day could never,
Never more adore.
Chorus. j
Do you still remember
When we met once more,
Down the silv’ry river,
Down the rocky shore ?
Love seems has no patience.
Fate revel’ry keep.
Secrets and blue ocean,
Why are they So deep ?
Secrets and blue ocean.
Why are they so deep?
Chorus. ,

Collected Poems by Henry Newbolt (Nelson).
Thi3 gathers up the contents of three previous
volumes, and is good value for Is., plus the book-
seller’s 3d. “Drake’s Drum,” “Admirals All”
and “San Stefano” are well known, and his
other patriotic ballads are worth reading. New-
bolt excels in a nautical dirge like “Messmates” :
He gave us all a good-bye cheerily
At the first dawn of day ;
We dropped-him down the side full drearily
When the light died away.
It’s a dead dark watch that he’s a-keeping there,
And a long, long night that lags a-creeping there,
Where the Trades and the tides roll over him
And the great ships go by.
Poetry and —Joy
Lacking battlefields, I have jabbed my
nib deep enough into myself, forced it
through the mitral valve into the very heart
of me, felt the pain of the operation as the
torment of a rose-crowned Epicurean harping
wearily in an oaken pew of a wowser para-
dise, and while the ruddy gore dripped from
the quill, I have written—ye gods, what
have I not written ? Bad verse mostly,
twisted prose tufted with jingle, echoes of
old fragments of rhyme gathered by mistake
for poetry in the days of a misguided child-
hood —never a song with a living note in it.
lam not a conventional critic, nor do I
write as a critic at all. I state facts which,
if they should be found to correspond with
the experiences of others, should prove use-
ful to some earnest worker in constructing a
practical article entitled “ How to Make
Better Poetry than Homer.”
In the interests of truth I cannot afford
to be modest. I have written, foetry.
It was rather small for its age, and rather
thin, but two or three who knew said
it was IT. I here solemnly swear that
when the few, faint gleams of divine fire
that were mine came to me I was not on a
battlefield, I was not screwing the pen round
in my aortic cavity, and the words were not
written in blood at all. I believe that in-
spiration generally comes out of a blue sky,
and that if you want to get the best out of a
poet you should make him happy. It is
quite easy to make him happy, almost as
easy as it is to make him unhappy.
I once talked with one of the most
genuinely inspired of our poets. Jessie
Mackay has once or twice soared up to the
heights, and taken her seat as by right
among the immortals, the while she wrought
music on an old Celtic harp, or blew her
soul into a magic bagpipe. She told me
that her best songs “just came to her.”
Of course they did. What does a conven-
tional critic know about the wireless systems
of the spirit? Has Ossian never a trans-
mitter. to send a word down from the fields
of asphodel to a lady in Christchurch ?
Pha! Who told young Keats about his
Latmian shepherd ?
To be sure, every poet has battlefields
within his own soul, just as he has an
assorted set of heavens and hells ; but it is
not advisable to cut his throat in order to
get them out. That “poets must suffer
before they can sing ” is about the worst
aphorism ever written. That poets are
made to suffer most infernally because
they can’t help trying to sing is nearer
the truth. I don’t believe that any really
great poet ever lived in hell as a regular
resident—except, perhaps, Poe ; but he was
the great freak singer—and I am pretty sure
that many of the little poets. might. have
been great ones if the war with their en-
vironment had been somewhat less bitter.
I agree with Dowell O’Reilly that actual
murder is of secondary consideration in the
production of great poetry, and I heartily
disagree with him when he suggests that the
poet’s own pain must go to the making of
his song.
DAVID McKEE WRIGHT.
The Poet and the Open Boat
An Open Boat was once adrift on a blue
but undrinkable sea. There were lo people
on board, including a Poet, and they were
all Starving. One day someone remarked
that it was getting Near the End ; so the
Poet, by way of Making Things Dismal,
started to read his Best Sonnet to a Girl
with Blue Eyes who was too weak to Resent
it. The Second Officer, who had charge of
the Boat and scorned Poetry, but knew
Tripe when he Saw It, as soon as the Per-
formance started, roused himself and growled
hoarsely, “Hand Me that Stuff!’ The
trembling Poet surrendered his treasured
MS. to the Officer, who, as soon as he had ex-
amined it shouted: “ Saved! There is enough
Tripe here for a Whole Meal! Pass
that Poet my Fountain Pen and the
Log Book and tell him he must write
us Three Good Meals of Tripe per day.”
Weeping bitterly, the Poet complied with
the Brutal Seaman’s demand, and kept the
boatload of people Well-Nourished till they
were picked up by a Liner. On reaching
Civilisation, the Grateful Castaways pub-
lished the Facts of the Rescue Far and
Wide, and the Shipwreck Relief Society had
a Special Gold Medal struck for the Good
Tripe-Maker. But, before they could Pre-
sent it to him, the Poet rushed away into
the Wilderness, where he died of a Broken
Vanity complicated by Cheap Cigarettes and
Strong Tea.— Moral : Some People are
Never Satisfied.

THE FIRST HUNDRED HALF-YEARLY ISSUES OF “ PUNCH "are
issued in 25 Quadruple Cloth Bound Volumes, each about 11% inches
high, 9% inches wide, and inches thick, containing 30,000 pages,
with about 50,000 illustrations, printed from the original plates. A twenty-sixth
volume to match has been added, being “The History of ‘Punch, by M. H.
Spielmann, enriched with numerous portraits, facsimiles of autographs, and other
curiosities of literature.
The 26 volumes are strongly bound in cloth, and, for the convenience of
suitably preserving this unique library, a special Bookcase has been made at our
Redfern factory. The “ Punch ” Bookcase is about 52m. high, 30m. wide, and
deep. It is made in fumed oak, by the highest skilled Australian labor,
and with the 26 volumes makes a notable addition to any library.
Mr. Punch’s good wine needs no bush. For more than half a century it
has been poured in a generous measure, and relished by the British race in all
parts of the world.
Although Mr. Punch has changed with the times, and his cartoons have
become less caustic, they have lost neither their tone nor their influence.
“Punch,” who for many years past has set up as the incarnation of all that
is best in wit and virtue, is a scholar and a gentleman. He is moreover, on his
own showing, a perfect combination of humor, wisdom and honor ; and yet, in
spite of all, not a bit of a prig.
It may be fairly said that “ Punch ” appeals to a greater variety of readers
than any other publication. A child crows over the horses and dogs with which
the pages abound. A statesman looks at the cartoons when he is feeling the
pulse of the nation.
Some of the greatest among English men of letters have written for
“ Punch’s ” pages ; and painters whom other painters delighQo honor have been
proud to be counted among “ Punch’s ” artists. Even in these utilitarian days
“ Punch ” has preserved the tradition of scholarly elegance, and is a delight to
readers whose tastes are often offended by the productions of the new school

The “ Punch ” Bookcase and the 26 Volumes.
of humor and the
“unschooled
school of liter-
ature.”
Yet if Mr.
Punch never of-
fends the most
critical, on the
other hand he
values the affec-
tion of his less
exacting admirers,
and finds among
them everyone
who loves field
sports and horses
and dogs, how-
ever little he may
care for books.
If there is one
thing more than
another on which
“ Punch ” prides
himself, on which,
nevertheless, he
is constantly re-
proached by those
who would see his
pages a remorse-
less mirror of
human weakness
and vice, it is his
purity and clean-
ness. This trait
was Thackeray’s
delight. He
wrote :
“As for your morality, Sir, it does not become me to compliment you on it before your
venerable face But permit me to .say. that there never was before published in this world so
many volumes that contained so much cause for laughing, so little cause for blushing ; so many
jokes and so little harm.”
A word may be said about the importance of a set of “Punch ’ as a work
of reference. One thinks of “Punch”, as an. amusing journal;, but it serves,
particularly in the bound volumes of the first fifty years, another and a larger
purpose “Punch’s” political influence has been enormous; its cartoons
which recorded the great movements and great emotions of the Victorian era
are part of the history they helped to make.
The bound volumes furnish a living picture of English life, dress and
manners, English history and English thought, through the course of half a
century of progress so great that, although it may be equalled, it can never be
excelled.
“ Punch ” is a chronicle of manners and customs, an encyclopaedic record
of the life and talk and dress of our fathers and grandfathers. No account of
the years which elapsed between 1841 and 1891 could be more vivid and
interesting than these informal annals.
The writings of Thackeray and his comrades, in their original dress, as they
first saw the light of day in the pages of “ Punch,” have for booklovers a charm
which is diminished when they appear in any other guise, however luxurious.
Many of the drawings with which the masters of modern English art have
enriched the pages of “ Punch ” have been reproduced in costly folios, with broad
margins and elaborate annotations ; but they can best be enjoyed in their native
environment —the pages of “ Punch.” Ihe story of Punch s jokes is told
with great fulness in Mr. Spielmann’s “ History of ‘ Punch,’ ” which forms the
26th volume to the set. A few of the anecdotes with which the history abounds
give to the intending purchaser of “ Punch ” volumes a foretaste of the good
things that await him.
The most popular joke that “ Punch ”■ ever published, and, perhaps, the
neatest and most unexpected turn of words in the English language, was packed
away in the corner of a page, and the editor apparently had no idea that the two
little lines would become immortal. They ran : “ Worthy of attention. Advice
to those about to marry —Don’t.”
For more than half a century this little joke has been quoted in one news-
paper or another, in connection with all sorts of subjects, and yet we learn
from Mr. Spielmann’s history that one of the knottiest problems he encountered
was to locate the authorship of the joke.
Another of “ Punch’s ” most successful drolleries was the story of the Scot,
who found his visit to London so inordinately costly that he had been there
only a few hours when “Bang went saxpence.” It was really said in sober
earnest by a Glaswegian, and overheard by Sir John Gilbert, who repeated it
and passed it on its way to “Punch.”
From within the “ Punch ” walls there also came within recent years the
suggestion for a drawing which may be counted among the most successful of
Mr. Punch’s achievements. A correspondent sent in the idea for a picture of a
grimy tramp sitting down to write with his broken pen a testimonial for a firm of
soap-makers —“I used your soap two years ago; since then I have used no other.”
The author of the “ History of ‘ Punch ’” made a careful estimate to the
effect that there are on an average at least four jokes to every column, and for the
first fifty years this gives a total of not less than a quarter of a million.
The files of fifty years of “ Punch ” are now for the first time offered at a
price which brings them within the reach of the general public. The 25 quad-
ruple volumes possess so many phases of interest that it is impossible to indicate
them in the compass of this announcement. ... To the 25 quadruple volumes
have been added a 26th—Mr. M. H. Spielmann’s “ History of ‘Punch
which will be found a treasure house of good stories as well as an indispensable
appendix to the set of “Punch.”

Mr. GEORGE T1THERADGE.
THOSE WHO
SEEK HEALTH
should read this letter from that popular actor,
Mr. George S. Titheradge, who speaks elo-
quently of the good derived from the standard
Australian nerve remedy,
CLEMENTS
TONIC.
People who take an interest in the theatre
will remember that the popular actor, Mr.
George S. Titheradge, was not at all well when
he arrived from England. This culminated i'n
a severe attack of appendicitis with compli-
cations. On reaching convalescence, he was,
with great difficulty, induced to try Clements
Tonic, with the gratifying result that he was
often taken for his own son. The following
letter speaks for itself: —
Dear Sirs,
I promised to let you know what good (if any)
Clements Tonic did me. This is the result:—
Two or three times recently 1 have had occasion, in
the course of business, to mention my name to people
who were unacquainted with me off the stage.
In each case the query has been put to me: “How’s
your father’s health ? ” Verb. sap.
Yours faithfully,
GEORGE S. TITHERADGE.

My home’s the countryside
■ Where banks of dogwood bloom ;
My roads are rivers wide
Winding through the gloom ;
My friends are wind and rain,
That beat across the bars ;
My bed’s the open plain

Not in the lamp-lit street
Comes the call to me,
But where, in meadows sweet.
Low hums the bee ;
Not down the pavements bare
Are the paths to Paradise,
But through a bluer air
My roadway lies.
Not in the city’s roar
Life’s full pulses beat,
But by some river-shore
Where the deep streams meet.
Where on the hill and plain
Whispers the tree,
Voices of wind and rain
Call unto me.

Where wild acacias bloom ;

C. G. A. COLLES.
A Pathetic Ballad.
Behind the sands the sun went down,
A sunset red and flary ;
She sighed and looked towards yonder town,
J) <1 doleful, soulful Mary.
The sun went down, the moon arose,
It gleamed upon the silken hose
Of doleful, soulful Mary.
I loved the gold upon her hair,
But I was wise and wary.
Of harder gold she had her share,
Had bashful, cashful Mary.
The moon shone on her patent shoes,
The chance was mine to take dr lose
With bashful, cashful Mary.
We sat upon the moonlit sands, ..
Her eyes were wide and stary;
I held the little gloveless hands
Of wimpled, dimpled Mary.
What “ wimpled ” means I do not know,
But it’s a rhyme and has to go,
Thus—wimpled, dimpled Mary.
I stole my arm around her waist
In manner sly and chary,
She caught her breath in sudden haste,
Did flushing, blushing Mary ;
She djd not move, she did not speak,
I softly kissed the satin cheek
Of blushing, gushing Mary.
And this is how it came to pass,
Hear me, Bohemians, hairy:
I found myself a tethered ass
Beside my bride, my Mary ;
With scores of kids around my knee,
I eat my buttered toast for tea
Beside my bride, my Mary.

A Wanderer’s Song.
You sit beside the fire
Quaffing the hot spiced ale,
Full fed, with no desire
But to escape the gale.
I face the wind and rain,
I take the track again,
Across the lonely lands I tramp, on stormy seas I
sail.
Snug coiled in ingle-nook
You tell the twice-told story ;
You read in dog-eared book
Romances old and hoary.
You stay at home, and rest.
I love adventure best,
I meet strange men, I hear new tales, I see earth’s
morning glory.
You have your market day,
Your cattle and your corn.
I pass through far Cathay,
I round the gleaming Horn,
And on and onward swing
Wandering, wandering—
A passing cloud, a stream, a wind —on wings of
rapture borne.
I know each holy land,
Each Himalayan peak,
Know where famed ruins stand,
Where upstart cities reek.
Man’s work and Nature’s I ,
Have seen beneath the sky.
There is no end of my desire, and all earth’s
bounds I seek.
Yet would I never rest,
Though all the roads were run,
But still pursue the quest
Beyond the setting sun,
Leaving the well-read earth.
And fare, with each re-birth,
From land to land, from star to star, till all the
worlds were won.

THE N.S.W. DECENTRALISATION
FRAUD.
A VIGOROUS but rather clumsy effort is being
made to keep alive, till the election is over, an
impression that the Wade Government is really
burning to do something great for the Closed
Ports of N.S.W., and for the districts that are
ruined by the closure of these ports. With all
the agility of a lame crocodile the Government
tries to bolt with the hare and to race with the
long, lean, sketchy dogs that pursue the hare. It
is spending money by millions to double the rail-
way facilities of Sydney, so that there may be
room to drag thither all the trade of N.S.W. for
many years to come, and it is thus bidding
hard for the votes of the Sydney traders.
It isn’t spending any money on the deep-
water Closed Ports, either in the matter of
wharyes or railway communications; but it
has appointed a Commission (strangely enough
the spending of millions around Sydney didn’t
require any Commission) to inspect them and
inquire about them, as if they were some strange,
astounding, newly-discovered animals; and it
seems to hope that this show of activity will be a
successful bid for the votes of the Northern and
Southern districts. And the pro- Wade papers
talk airily about the Government’s “decentralisa-
tion policy as if it were an assured thing instead
of a mere hollow election pretence. But now and
then an awkward hand drops the veil of hypo-
crisy, and gives away the show, and then there is
trouble.
* * * *
A ftiw- days-ago," for instance,' the London
Times began tp make remarks about the amazing
policy which has decreed that there shall be only
one city worth mentioning in a State nearly three
times the size of England, Scotland, Ireland and
Wales, and that not even a fairly central city.
It commented on the methods which make that
city stand for a larger and ever larger proportion
of the population ; which drag to it more and
more of the State’s foreign commerce till now it
has got the whole lot, barring Newcastle’s local
coal trade ; which leave ports quite as commodious
as Sydney without railways, wharves, population,
or any of the other essentials of business ; which
deviate railways to keep them away from every
good port bar Sydney; and which ruin the out-
lying farmer by forcing him to pay railway freight
over hundreds of miles of needless distance because
he must either send his produce to Sydney
or let it rot. In fact, the Times showed up
the magnitude of the evil which it is alleged the
great and good Gregory Wade, earnestly sup-
ported by the S. M. Herald and Telegraph, is
about to put right. Thereby, if Wade and the
two papers could have seen it, the Times greatly
exalted them, for if they are really going to
tackle a huge evil that is much more to their
credit than if they tackled a small one. But in-
stead of being pleased, Wade grew angry ; and
as for the Telegraph, anger was no term to ex-
press its condition. In its bitterness it chewed
soap to make a froth, and unburdened itself
of the following under the heading “More Mis-
representation ” :
It is in every sense of the word regrettable that an
organ like the London Times should once more misrepre-
sent Australia before the British public in the manner
indicated by our cables this morning. To say that our
railway system has been deliberately planned in the in-
terests of Sydney, and that the interior has been per-
sistently sacrificed, is to quite ignore the restraints of
accuracy. It is the interior that always asks for railway
communication with the metropolis, and it would con-
sider its interests sacrificed to some other interest if in
lieu of a line to Sydney it was offered one to any smaller
centre. No doubt the policy of opening up new
seaports adopted by the Wade Government is a
sound one, and xve hope to see COCKSPUR lines running
into the hinterland of all our harbors in due time. But
EVEN THEN THEY WILL MOSTLY BE EMPLOYED BRINGING PRO-
DUCE FOR SHIPMENT BY COASTAL STEAMER TO SYDNEY, where
it will hi' either consumed or sent oversea in the big
ocean liners. The Times suggests that British capitalists
would more readily support our investments if assured
that tiie railways were not to be devoted to the further
inflation of Sydney. If British capitalists require any
such assurance it is only because the Times and other
misleading guides on Australian questions have given
them a false idea of the position. Sydney is growing, like
other modern capitals are growing, because the effect of
present-day civilisation tends more and more to concen-
tratepeople in thebigeities. Whether this is agood orabad
thing it is inevitable, and no manipulation of the railway
system in the interest of Sydney has anything to do with
it. As a matter of fact, our policy of railway construction
is controlled mainly by the country interests. When did
the Times hear of a railway league formed in Sydney to
bring a line to the metropolis which the people of the
interior wanted to go to some other terminus. It can, if
it chooses, find numbers of leagues in country districts for
getting railway communication with the capital. This
talk about “deliberately inflating Sydney” at the
expense of the country is crude nonsense.
• « \ •
That is the voice of the paper which is Wade’s
most influential supporter, and as Wade lias not
disclaimed its statements the northern and
southern districts can now form some idea of the
real value of his “decentralisation policy.”
N.S.W., as already mentioned, is nearly three
times the size of the British Isles. It is larger
than any European State bar Russia. It has so
much coast-line that its farthest northern coastal
town is about 600 miles from Sydney. Also it has
three or four harbors quite as good as Sydney, arid
quite as capable of becoming great centres of
population. Yet with all these resources it
is not, according to the Telegraph, to be
allowed to grow any real new coastal towns —
any places like Liverpool, Cardiff, Glasgow,
the Tyne, Hull, Newport, Leith, and the
score of other ports which Britain possesses.
All that is suggested is the building of little
“ cockspur ” lines to bringdown a few cabbages
and potatoes to the ports that are now closed,
so that these goods may be bumped into little
steamers, and carried, at needless expense, to the
same old invariable, far-off, congested Sydney for
transhipment and export. Everything is to
go round by Sydney in the old, old way.
However deep and safe and commodious
any port outside -Sydney may be, it is
never to have a great railway system behind
it, and there is to be no big city on it, and
no big o'ceaxi liners are to call in and trade there.
The boasted decentralisation business, it seems, is
to consist of a few miles of line at each harbor,
and a village on the shore, and a petty wharf at
which the local pig-boat can tie up. That kind
of decentralisation seems hardly worth having.
What would Liverpool and Glasgow and Cardiff
be if Britain had these narrow ideas?
* » ’* *
The Telegraph’s theory is that it is the
country and not Sydney which has clamored for
the dragging of everything to Port Jackson. “It
is the interior,” it says, “that always asks for
railway communication with the metropolis, and
it would consider its interests sacrificed ... if,
in lieu of a line to Sydney, it was offered one to
any smaller centre.” In a sense the statement is
true, though it may be mentioned that Finley and
Berrigari, in Western Riverina, have been clamor-
ing for a 12-mile line to Tocumwal on the Murray,
so that they might have a short road to Mel-
boui’ne, almost since Finley and Berrigan came
into existence. But, as a matter of fact, there
hasn’t been very much clamor for lines to, say,
Twofold Bay and Coff’s Harbor because (1) the
centralisation policy has left very little popula-
tion thereabouts to clamor for anything ; (2) the
people have always known that it was no use
clamoring, for they were" always given clearly to
understand that they couldn’t hope for a railway
to any place except Sydney ; and (3) no district
wanted a line to a harbor, however good, where
there were no wharves, no Customs House
and no prospects, where no township was
laid out, and where, trade would be almost
impossible because of the special railway
rates devised in the special interests of
Sydney. When N.S.W. has a Wade Govern-
ment which deliberately carries its North Coast
line round in a great expensive curve in order to
avoid touching one of the best harbors in N.S. W.,
there is very little to be gained by an appeal for
communication with any such harbor, however
convenient it may look on the map.
* * * *
According to the Telegraph, the amazing con-
centration of all N.S. W. business and affairs at
, Sydney is quite a natural arrangement; therefore,
of course, any attempt to interfere with it by de-
centralisation schemes, such as Wade professes
to advocate, is wholly unnatural. “Sydney is
growiiig,”'says the WADE-ite paper, “ like other
modern capitals a’re growing, because the
effect of present-day civilisation tends more
and more to concentrate people in the big
cities. Whether this is a good or a bad
thing it is inevitable.” When Wade’s prin-
cipal journalistic advocate appears thus as an
infuriated supporter of the congestion policy
there seems very little hope left for Wade as an
apostle of decentralisation.' The fact that the
Telegraph’s statements are a series of glaring
falsehoods doesn’t make .the outlook for Wade’s
sincerity any the better. As a matter of public
knowledge, Sydney is hot '“.growing like other
modern capitals are growing!” There is no coun-
try of any importance outside Australia where so
large a proportion of population and commerce is
concentrated iutthe capital; where the proportion
of population and commerce centred in the capital
is increasing at anything like the same rate;
and where practically all the x-ailways lead
to the capital and to no other seaport what-
soever. The concentration of everything at
Sydney is a rare—almost a unique—disease. Lon-
don is content with one-seventh of Britain’s ship-
ping business, and New York with about one-
fourth of that of the U.S. The trade of France
is divided among 11 leading ports; that of Ger-
many among seven ; that of Italy among seven ;
that of Russia among about a dozen. Most of
these countries believe so thoroughly in the
doctrine of giving every good harbor an equal
chance that the capital city occupies quite a minor
position as a trading centre. Not one of them ever
struck the amazing idea devised in N.S. W. of shut-
ting up every good port save that at the capital,
and of treating a great part of its own country as
if it were a leper or a public enemy. The bar-
barous policy whereby a State systematically
depopulates its remoter provinces by refusing
them a sea outlet is known only in N.S. W., Vic-
toria and, to a less extent, in S.A. And when
Premier Wade’s loudest journalistic supporter
rises to clamor in defence of that policy just at
the time when Premier Wade is trying to rake
in votes by professing to have seen the folly and
iniquity of. it, there is serious reason to doubt
whether Wade’s conversion is all that it might be.
THE FIVE YEARS THAT POSSIBLY
REMAIN.
Tkn or a dozen days ago the Japanese Govern-
ment wound up a career of shameless lying,
treachery, cruelty, thieving, brigandage and
every possible kind of oppression by the formal
annexation of Korea. The Land of the Morning
Calm has ended its career as the casual serf of
Japan, and started its new history as that
country’s acknowledged slave and Gibeonite.
The last days of the old kingdom were undigni-
fied and full of wretchedness. During the 15
years which intervened between the date when
the Korean Queen was mutilated, wounded and
burned—it is alleged that she was set on fire before
she was quite dead—at the orders of a fiendish'
Japanese ambassador, and the time when the light
finally went out, there was no conceivable woe
that the Koreans did not suffer at the hands of
the Nippon men who Swarmed like locusts into
their unhappy country. Yet Korea was Japan’s
formal ally all this time, just as Britain—and
Australia—are to-day. Its “independence and
integrity ” were guaranteed by Japan as recently
as six years ago, and the same independence and
integrity were fully recognised by all the Powers
of the world. Korea had all the guarantees that
our insane Peace Societies and such-like small
deer would have us rely upon, and yet not a gun
was fired by any foreigner in its defence. It had
no army and no navy. No one cared much for it as
an ally or grudged it as an addition to the fighting
strength of Japan. It was the Peace Society
country pure and simple, and so its sun set in
blood and tatters. Even the Hague Conference
chased the Korean envoys like dogs from its door.
A Peace Conference has no use for a country that
can’t or won’t fight.
* # # #
The fact that Japan and Korea were sworn
allies during all the years of spoliation and
butchery suggests that it is absurd to look on the
treaty between Japan and Britain asan important
element in our own political situation. Evidently
alliance with Japan makes no real difference in
the situation unless it pays Japan that it should
make a difference, and in that case the difference
would be there without any alliance. Assuming,
however, that the Anglo-Jap treaty is observed
while it lasts, it must he remembered -that it has
only anotherfiveyears torun. In 1915, at the latest,
it is openly alleged that Japan will secede from
the old compact and join the Triple League of
Germany, Austria and Italy, unless some remark-
able change in the political aspect makes the
Triple League, by that time, an affair that isn’t
worth joining. There are even statements in
England about diplomatists who have been shown
the draft of the new treaty of the four Powers.
And assuming that affairs in 1915 are much the
same as in 1910, it is difficult to see how the Jap
—being the sort of Jap he is—can well do any-
thing else than throw in his lot with the German
and his satellites. In fact, he would almost cer-
tainly do it, even if he were a much more scrupu-
lous Jap than he is. The great trouble is that,
being the Jap he is, he may not wait till 1915.
* * * *
When the Anglo-Jap treaty was made in 1902
Japan was in desperate need of a very strong
marine partner. It was just about to fight
Russia, and it had to convey its troops, by sea to
Korea and Manchuria in order to hunt up the
Muscovite enemy in his lair. In those days
Russia had a great though scattered fleet, and
the rottenness of it was not yet known. Japan
had a fair-sized and concentrated fleet, but it was,"
in point of numbers, nothing like the one. the
brown man’s country now possesses. Japan hoped
to beat the Russian navy single-handed, but
it had no hope at all if even a respectable
second-rate marine Power joined Russia, unless
the Admiral of the white fleet was incompetent to
the verge of lunacy. So Nippon wanted a backer
who could give all the naval Powers of the
world due notice that they must keep out of
the scrap—such notice as they absolutely dare
not disregard. In the quest for an over-
whelmingly strong sea-coadjutor—one whose
marine writ ran on every ocean—it naturally
looked to Britain. Britain filled the bill in those
days. It was the only country that could possibly
fill the bill. And with its unhappy tendency to
back the wrong horse, Britain was more than
willing to fill the bill. In fact, it rushed to do it.
* * * *
The situation is changed. There is prac-
tically no Russian navy left, and the Japanese
navy has been greatly strengthened. There used
to be three fleets in the Pacific—those of Britain,
Russia and Japan. Now there is the last-named
only. If the brown men have any new trouble
with Russia it will be a land war, fought out
where the empires join, in Manchuria. The
British ships would be no more use in such a
struggle than would C.esae’s galleys or the old
triremes of Sidon. Britain’s expeditionary army
of about 150,000 men would be of very little
use either, even if Britain were prepared to risk
it in such a vast and distant scrimmage. If
Japan had, or was likely to have, another naval
war on its hands in the Pacific, the British alliance
would no longer be of any great value. In 1902
Britain was equal to any three European Powers
at sea ; in 1910, so swiftly have events marched,
it fears that it will soon be barely, a
match for Germany alone. In 1902 it could
have spared a formidable squadron to help
Japan if necessary, and still kept its own shores
secure, and dominated the European seas;
in 1910 it has doubts about its own shores
without wasting its strength on distant expedi-
tions. In 1902, and up to 1905, big efficient
British fighting ships were afloat on every ocean ;
in 1910 they are all gathered on the defensive,
close round the British Isles, and the outer seas
are abandoned. In eight years the annual cost
of the British navy has risen from £30,000,000 to
£40,000,000, and an increase to £50,000,000 is
already in sight—yet Britain is relatively much
weaker on the water than it was eight years ago.
It is so much weaker that a British statesman re-
cently declared that any British Government
which sent a single battleship away soutlrof the
line wouldn’t last 10 days. The Jap has no ,
further use for a remote ally in this situation.
Britain has done all it can for Nippon
by indirectly securing for it Korea, a great
part of Manchuria, and the control of
the Pacific. It is time for Nippon to get out of
the partnership before it is called upon to do
something for Britain in return.
* * * *
Assuming that Japan’s next important ventuie
is towards Australia, the British alliance is, of
course, doubly useless. To have no friend except
the enemy is an insane position for ally
country to get into. The kind of friends Japan
would want in such a case are one or two great
military Powers—so great that a mere threat from
them would prevent the Russian armies over-
running Manchuria and Korea while the Japs
were busy elsewhere. Germany and Austria,
with 7,000,000 possible soldiers on the Russian
frontier, would answer the purpose admirably.
Further, Japan would want friends of such naval
tonnage that, because of them, Britain would
not dare to send any fleet worth mentioning into
the Pacific, no matter what was happening there,
lest the very heart and centre of the Empire
should be stormed while that fleet was away.
The Triple Alliance is the only combination
that has the naval strength required.
Assuming that Japan could show Germany,
the boss partner of the Triple Alliance,
just where its profit would come in, the deal
seems a simple and easy one to fix up. There
are four reasons for haste: (1) It is advisable
to get to work before Russia begins to
grow new ships in place of those which
were lost —partly through the insane pro-nigger
policy of Britain. (2) It is wise to rush things in
case the Triple Alliance should crumble during
the period of waiting. (3) It is good policy to
hurry before the completion of the Panama
Canal enables the disorderly U.S. fleet to shamble
into the Pacific at short notice, though as the
U.S. hasn’t even one big ocean-going cargo
steamer, and its fleet can’t crawl about except
with the aid of hired foreign vessels as coal-
carriers, the navy of Uncle Sam is likely to be
pretty well tied up in war time. (4) It is well to
get to work before Australia has any serious de-
fences of its own ; but probably this view of
the question won’t trouble the enemy much,
for Australia has been talking very much
about defences and doing very little. On the
other hand, it is advisable to delay till the naval
preparations of the proposed allies are rather
further advanced. Taking all these chances into
account, the only possible verdict is that the
trouble may come to-morrow —or it may come a
good while later. Judging by the experience of
Japan’s other ally, Korea, the date of the expiry
of the Anglo-Jap treaty has no bearing whatever
on the possible date of the trouble.
* * « *
The reason why Japan and Germany and any
other old nation should want Australia is that
this country is the last of the fertile empty lands,
and presents the last chance the world possesses
for colonisation on a very big scale. Certainly
Japan has got Korea as a colony ; but Korea is
only as large as Victoria, it is not especially
fertile, and it contains already 10,000,000 people.
That is to say, it is almost as thickly
peopled as the Indian Empire, and there isn’t
much room in Korea for colonisation in the proper
sense of the term. China, which lies beyond,
offers much chance of hard fighting and little
space for real colonisation. It is fairly probable
that Japan never cared very much for Korea, and
only regarded the capture of that country as
necessary in order to push the Russians back, so
that the Monkey Empire might not be liable to
attack in the rear while carrying out much larger
operations elsewhere. If that was the object in
view, then the Japanese policy worked admirably,
for Russia has been pushed back, -_and the
Pacific has been turned, for the time, into
a Japanese lake. Japan has already given
a broad hint that things wear a new aspect,
nowadays, by declaring a sort of commer-
cial war against Britain. It has devised a
new tariff with greatly increased duties, but the
duties on goods which are mainly imported from
Britain have been increased so vastly in excess of
the duties on goods which are habitually imported
from other countries that a hostile purpose seems
to stick out conspicuously. The process of
shoving foreigners out of Japan goes on apace;
the Japanese population in foreign countries
keeps growing, and the foreign population in
Japan keeps diminishing. So the shadow of
Nippon increases at this end of the world, while
the shadow of Britain exhibits no perceptible
expansion.
* * * *
The British person, indeed, has cause to be
worried. He pays a bigger bill for bloated arma-
ments than any other individual on earth ; and,
despite this lavish expenditure, his Voluntary
army is so small as to be a mere joke.
His navy is certainly the greatest on the seas ;
but Freetrade and Big Landlordism have so
ruined his agriculture, and have made him so
dependent on imported victuals, that the bulk of
his stupendous fleet is, at present, moored to his
own shores to protect his food supplies, and in
the matter of finding ships for distant foreign ad-
venture even Italy could probably put up a better
showing. He is worried by the fact that
his manhood keeps drifting away, most of it to
the foreign United States, where there is more
Protection and fewer big landlords. And John
Bull, in the mass, is apparently growing a little
tired of “Empire.” He made his latest great,
imperial splash when he fought in South Africa,,
for the Jews of Jewhannesburg. He toiled there!,
for three years. He buried some 50,000 men there..
He also buried some £240,000,000 of the money
which he badly wanted to buy potatoes and baeon-
rrnd with. He interred a heap of his oldi
glory, for the record of surrenders was the worst
in his history. In the end he paid his enemies to.
stop fighting. Now he sees a hostile tariff, and a.
United South Africa mostly ruled by Dutchmen,,
and he wonders where he comes in, and asks if the-
game is worth the candle. He was able to fight
the matter out in South Africa because the Boers ,
in front of him had only a handful of soldiers and
no fleet, and the Germans behind him hadn’t yet
got a real fleet. If Australia gets into trouble
with Japan-well, Australia is much further away
than South Africa, and the Japanese have ten.
times the army which the Boers possessed, and
they have the fleet which the Boers lacked, and,
there is now a really formidable German navy in-
John Bull’s rear. So when the next troubl&-


happens John Bull is likely to ask in dead
earnest if the game is worth the candle.
* * * *
These remarks are not made in an alarmist
spirit. There is nothing less profitable than the
J°h °f the alarmist—the person who hollers “ wolf ”
when there isn't even a Skye terrier on the
horizon. But it is worth while to mention that
five years have passed since Britain abandoned
its old control of the outer seas, and drew in its
fleets for the defence of its own coasts, and broadly
hinted to its big dependencies that they must
stand on their own defence more than they used
to do. Five years lie behind, and even if the
Anglo-Jap treaty is observed to the last second,
there are barely five years of security in front.
t?o far, there has been an immensity of patriotic
calk, but not one yard of the transcontinental
railway to Kalgoorlie has been built, nor one yard
of the line to Port Darwin, despite the fact that
these two great railways are among the first
essentials of defence. The railway system which
should unite North Queensland for defence pur-
poses with the northern part of Westralia hasn’t
even been planned. The first soldier to be trained
under the universal service scheme hasn’t gone
through his first drill. The first rifle hasn’t yet
h® en made in the Commonwealth arms factory,
ihe first premonitory cockboat of the new Aus-
tralian navy hasn’t appeared in these waters,
the first Australian-made big gun hasn’t been
mounted for the protection of the port where the
first attack may reasonably be expected. The
first new military settler hasn’t been planted in
the Northern Territory to be the first beginnings
ot the first real attempt to garrison the empty
lands. Yet already, though nothing has really
been done, Peace Society madmen and mad-
women are urging us to beware of “mili-
tarism,” and are talking in a tone which
might be justified if Australia had 250,000
soldiers under arms, and a fleet 100 strong
infesting the Northern sfeas. This tendency
to mistake blather for achievement, this in-
clination to urge the community to avoid spend-
ing all its money on defence before it has spent
more than a copper or two, and this habit of call-
ing on it to disarm when it hasn’t got further in
the way of armament than a toothpick, are
unfortunate. There would be some measure of
satisfaction if we could hope to shove the Peace
Society people into the front rank when the
trouble arrives; but, unfortunately, the Peace
Society people are swift runners, and are likely to
be out of the way when they are most wanted.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Progressive Land Tax Bill, Regarded as
a Measure for the Promotion of Closer
Settlement in Redfern.
Taxation, but so as not to discriminate between States
Cogitation tatfcS ' TOm Pan V ' ° f tke Auiitralian
The Australian Government has so far stuck to
its theory that the Progressive Land Tax must
*Pply equally to town aud country lands. The
idea is of quite recent development—in fact, it
was heard of for the first time a month or two
ago. Before that date no one dreamed that a
land-tax with a £5OOO exemption might be so
applied as to pile a heavy impost on a scrap of
city property with 10ft. or 20ft. frontage, the said
impost not being really for the purpose of getting
revenue, but levied, partly at least, on the
pretence that the scrap is a big estate which
requires bursting up in the public interest.
It was assumed, in fact, that there would be two
exemptions—one of all properties valued at less
than £5OOO, and another of all properties covering
not more than, say, half an acre or an acre of
ground—and the popular impression is that the
Government, in taking up its present attitude, is
acting on some very inferior legal advice and on a
total misconception of the clause of the Constitu-
tion above quoted. Of course, if it was proposed
to exempt certain towns by name, the Progressive
Land Tax would be illegal, for the discrimination
between *■ partsof States” would then be obvious.
But_an acre or half-acre exemption is just as legal
or just as illegal as a £5OOO exemption. To
exempt alike the half-acre holding between the
Darling and Broken Hill and the similar holding
beside Sydney G.P.O. isn’t discriminating be-
tween parts of a State ; it is putting the whole
State on the same footing. If the acre or half-
acre exemption won’t stand inspection in the
High Court, then the measure is already hopeless
by reason of the £5OOO exemption, and a
Constitutional amendment is required before any-
thing can be done. The Bulletin firmly believes,
however, that the measure is perfectly legal. As
for the need for the half-acre or acre or some such
exemption, it is so" conspicuous as to require no
argument. It should be the object of the law to
fall heavily on the town land monopolist—the one
who holds a big area of land and is a mere col-
lector of rents. But the individual who buys a
scrap of city land on which to follow his own
occupation is rather to be pitied than blamed if
his allotment is worth. £BO,OOO. The purchaser
of a business, a building and a few yards of
ground, say at the corner of King and George
streets, Sydney, would be much better
pleased if the ground was only worth £BOO. It
does him no good to have the extra £79,200 locked
up. It doesn’t make business one whit the better.
Assuming that money is worth 5 per cent., it
means to him a dead loss of £3960 per annum,
which he has to make good out of somebody. If
the Progressive Land Tax strikes him it will mean
an additional amount to be made good at the ex-
pense of somebody, for he can’t dodge the tax by
cutting up his land and selling it like the £BO,OOO
monopolist in the country. Forty thousand acres
can be easily cut into 16 farms, but 80ft. of city
land won’t go into 16 allotments, each‘with a
shop on it, unless the shop is turned into some-
thing tall and thin like a mast, with a spiral
staircase up it, and the goods hanging by
strings from the top. What is required in towns
and cities is a Progressive Land Tax on the big
ground landlord who doesn’t hold land for his own
use, but is a mere monopolist and gatherer of rents ;
knd a heavy tax on all future unearned increment.
The idea of applying a Closer Settlement policy
(and that is what the Progressive Land Tax with
the £5OOO exemption really is) to Darlington and
Redfern and Collingwood and Little Bourke-
street, simply because it is suited to the
wastes of New England and Gippsland, seems
grotesque, somehow. There is no demand for
Closer Settlement in Redfern,
Claw-Hammer Railway Systems.
“ Leo Leak’s ” few words:—
Despite their penurious condition, the State Govern-
ments of Australia are announcing “ a vigorous and. up-
to-date railway construction policy.” Yet none of them
appears to be vigorous enough to even mention an ex-
periment with Brennan’s mono-rail. Besides the advant-
ages of cheaper and faster service, obliteration,of gauge
breaks and the possibility of a surface line over almost
any kind of country, the mono-rail system will save a pile
of money that is now being shovelled out all over the
Commonwealth in re-grading-. In Victoria enormous
sums have been spent already in reducing some of the
awful one-in-40 banks that were dragging the innards
out of Tait’s engines. Many of these banks have been
cut down to one-in-50; but even this is a heap too stiff
for anything under an “ A A ” type of loco, when there
is a full cargo behind. Hence the necessity for double-
banking, and incidentally the cause of accidents. In places
like the Bacchus Marsh bank a third engine is often invited
to shove behind the Adelaide express in order to give that
flying animal some chance of living up to its name.
YVhere there are long, steep hills to climb, it may be im-
possible to re-grade for the old two-rail type of train
without recourse to tunnelling ; but this process, on an
average, eats up cash to the tune of £lOOO a chain. The
mono-rail is advertised to climb a one-in-10 grade (528 ft.
a mile) without turning a hair, and to fly round a two-
chain radius curve with less effort than a Sydney tram.
In the Cold Land a one-in-75 grade (70ft. a mile) is con-
sidered a tremendous bump to haul a train over on a
4ft. B£ft. gauge ; and a Victorian one-in-40 (132 ft. a mile)
is enough to make Weary’s engines feel very tired.
The necessity for re-grading some of Australia’s main
lines becomes apparent when the railway up the Dela-
ware River valley (U.S.A.) is taken as an example. The
one-in-88 gradient on the old line was considered too
headlong for economical working, so a new track is
being built with a ruling grade of one-in-176, at the stu-
pendous cost of £66,000 a mile. True, 11 miles are' "cut
off the distance, but to do so an embankment
three miles long and up to 100 ft. high, is being con-
structed. If it pays to spend £1,800,000 on the rebuild-
ing of a line that is graded to one-in-88, even the common
or barnyard intellect can perceive the coming of the day
when Australia must level down its railway precipices.
Victoria doesn't possess all the steeps. In New South
Wales, between Limbri and VValcha Road, Johnson’s
engine draws produce, passengers and sundries up 1792 ft.,
which gives a through grade of one-in-58 for 20 miles.
And from Bluff Rock to Bunguila the same loco, strains
its cylinders for four awful miles up 426 ft., on a gentle
average slope of one-in-49£. Even Bananaland, with its
toy gauge, seldom approaches these grades. But from
Murphy’s Creek to Harlaxton (near Toowoomba) the
mails of George Rex are hauled through numerous
tunnels, round curves of five, six and seven
chain radius for 17 miles, on an average rise
of one-in-73. All the above grades are on
main lines, on which express passenger and heavy
goods traffic has to be accommodated. It is also along
some of these and similar tracks that produce and back-
loading are hauled past good ports, strangled in the em-
bryonic stage to boost up two or three bloated capitals,
irrespective of the fact that a better grade, and cer-
tainly a shorter route, might be found for sending them
to harbors especially provided by Providence for the pur-
pose. I don’t wish to hurl disrespectful language at our
engineers. They are usually informed that a line has to
be run from Gehenna to the Book of Jeremiah or there-
abouts, and the quicker and straighter it is accomplished
the better—so long as “straighter” is interpreted to
mean in a cityward direction. Now heavv-grade lines
are mighty touchy animals to train, and cannot be run
off at Melbourne Cup pace. The wear and tear of
big grades eat up cash like a wild-cat gold-mine.
But a service fitted with Brennan’s gyroscope wouldn’t
even" discard its overcoat to mount our steepest and
longest banks. If the Australian Parliament is going to
be national in anything more than name, it will have to
look into the latest and speediest inventions before con-
structing the transcontinentals. And (omitting flying
machines) the contrivance most likely to fulfil the need,
on present appearances, ii the one-rail invention of
Brennan. The day on which the trouble lands at Aus-
tralia’s back gate won’t want to be the one on which we
have doubts concerning gauges, curves, grades, detours,
block systems and deviations. The one thing necessary
and indispensable will be speed, greased speed, and train-
loads of it.
«
The Anonymous “Worker” Who Loves the
Low-Wage Party.
At last Federal elections considerable reliance was
placed by N.S. W. “ Liberalism ” on gifts of buns
and scones as engines for securing Labor support
on behalf of anti-Labor candidates. In the pre
sent State struggle the free confectionery racket
has been dropped almost entirely, and “Liberal-
ism ” is putting its trust in anonymous letters in
the press. Letter-writing is legal, and hence
much safer than buns. These missives are dotted
about our great dailies like leaves in Vallom-
brosa. They are mostly signed “ Labor ” or
“Worker ” or “Unionist,” or something of that
sort, and they are invariably concerned to show
that the aims and actions of Labor and Unionism
are partly mad and partly criminal. The follow-
ing, which appeared in the S. M. Herald a few
days ago, is a fair sample of its class :
Sir, grant me a small space in your influential
columns to express in some slight degree the debt of
gratitude the shop-assistants of this State owe the
Premier and the Liberal party for their loyalty and de-
votion to our welfare right throughout the debate on the
Saturday half-holiday question, and more especially
when the Labor party undoubtedly tried its best to
destroy the result of the years of agitation and expense
on our part. It ought to show the electors of N.S.W.
plainer than any words can tell how very little trust they
can place in the promises of those men, who will stop at
nothing in order to oust the present Government, and
gain office themselves.
Abuse, slander and- misrepresentation are their
weapons; honor, fairness and consistency they have no
time for, and don’t know the meaning of. Give such
men rope enough and they will surely hang themselves,
politically, let us hope, before the elections come on. ’
I hope the shop-assistants throughout the length and
breadth of New South Wales will bear in mind on election
day the treacherous and dishonorable action of the Labor
party. I am, etc.,
SHOP-ASSISTANT.
It is a fine, trenchant effort, equal to the best the
average “Liberal’’leader-writer is capableof. And
yet it fails to cut much ice. If there is any one
section of the community which has cause to be
hostile to “Liberalism” it is the shop-assistant
class. “Liberalism” in N.S.W. is, of course,
fine, old, fruity and intolerant .Reaction, spelt
otherwise. Behind C. G. Wade and his colleagues
is every low-wage and long-hour enthusiast in the
State. In the “ Liberal ” camp are all the well-
to-do folk who consider that 30s. a week is ample
for any counter-ieaper or clerk, apd that those
who clamor for more are insolent hounds and
social levellers. They are the modern proto-
types of the early Conservative who regarded
Hood as a “d-—d revolutionary ” for writing
“The Song of the Shirt.” There is not a boon
that the shop assistants have got from “Liberal-
ism ” which “ Liberalism ” has not been kicked
into according against its will. The crowd which
is now behind Wade is the identical crowd which
frantically opposed the introduction of the N.S. W.
Arbitration Act, not on its merits as an Act, but
on the alleged ground that any attempt to
“interfere between master and man” or to
“regulate the laws of Supply and demand” was
bad economics, worse equity and “foredoomed to
failure,” anyhow. The Arbitration Act was
offered up by “Liberalism” on the anti-Labor
.altar, but not before it had served to vindicate
the conciliation principle and render its perpetu-
ation, in some form, a necessity. Hence the
Industrial Disputes Act, and hence, incidentally,
such financial benefits as have accrued recently,
to shop employees. And here the wage-earners’
debt to “Liberalism” ends abruptly. Wade
and his party, stoutly opposed the' Saturday
half-holiday movement—the movement which
Labor has always upheld—till public opinion
forced them into it. And as in the past,
so in the future, the patty stands pledged’
if not to openly oppose every measure for
bettering the, financial position of wage-earners,
at any rate to delay it as far as lies in its power.
The present-day political position, is quite clear.
There are two parties offering—the Labor party,
which aims frankly to improve the low-wau-e
worker’s dreary lot; and the “Liberal” party,
which talks largely about its aspirations in that
direction, but which indicates, if only by the
people who are backing it, that it is there to block
as much wage-raising as it can, short of dragging
revolution or the sack on its head. The anonymous-
letter scheme is designed to lay before an un-
thinking public a proposition which even the
daily paper leader-writers lack the leathern
hide to advance, namely, that the most ill-paid
classes in the community—the shop hands, clerks,
warehousemen, and so forth—are seething with
rage against the party which proposes to do a
lot for them, and burning with affection for the
party which proposes to do as little as possible for
them. The arguments, in this connection, are put
in good, vigorous fashion, as aforementioned ; but
on the face of them they don’t bear inspection.
Medical Bye-ways.
The illegal practitioners of Sydney, like those of
every other big city, are divided into two classes
between which yawns an impassable gulf. On
the one side are the quacks, mostly women, who
run the business for a while, have many accidents
and narrow escapes, and either lose their nerve
and retire into private life or settle down in
gaol. (Some of them, by the way, come to
grief and drift into gaol over their first or
second clumsy operation.) They are too numerous
for the good of the community, but not nearly as
numerous as people think. The gaol keeps weed-
ing them out, for one thing. The deeds that are
done in their dens of infamy are too dreadful to
describe ; plain infanticide accompanied by the
burning of the body under the laundry copper is
one of them. In the majority of cases the pre-
mises of the bogus “nurse” are also used for
genuine accouchement purposes, and the
legitimate and illegitimate businesses are run
together. On the other side of the gulf
is the private hospital, run by a medical
man, supervised by a highly trained matron,
and staffed with nurses of exceptional capacity.
In these establishments infanticide is a safe thing,
the risks being reduced to a minimum and detec-
tion practically provided against. Even should
an “accident” occur the patient dies in an odor of
respectability, is “deeply mourned,’’and is chased
to the grave by a legal and proper certificate and an.
impressive funeral. But, as far as is known, there
are never any accidents. An old police officer
told the writer that, in all his experience, he does
not remember one of these practitioners being
brought to justice or even placed on his trial.
Doctors have been tried for illegal practices; but
in every case it was a doctor who had no hospital,
and who made the grave mistake of allowing
the woman operated on to go back to
her home or her regular occupation. The
costly, high-class establishment is much more
numerous than is generally supposed, and there is
reason to believe that it is still on the increase.
There is also in Sydney quite a number of private
hospitals which do not touch infanticide, but
make much wealth for their owners out of un-
necessary operations, drink cures, and so forth.
But by far the worst of the sort are those which
specialise in child murder. Not only do they rob
the community of the young lives that are des-
troyed, but in time they destroy the reproductive
power of the woman operated upon—and there
are plenty of cases where the same woman has
been operated on three or four times. As far as
the country is concerned she might then as well be
pole-axed—save possibly for her value as a wash-
ing, ironing, scrubbing or sewing implement. The
only remedy would appear to be the national-
isation of health and healing, and the utter
abolition of the private hospital and lying-in
home.
The Alleged Bargain with the State.
That honest Conservative, Henry Wrixon, re-
tired President of the Victorian House of Rich
Landlords, lately wrote a two-eoiumn article, in
the Melbourne Argus to urge the familiar argu-
ment against a progressive land-tax, that" it
breaks the bargain made by the community with
the purchaser of the land. Wrixon, painstaking
and sincere, put this case just about as well as it
could be put. Briefly, it is this : A squatter pur-
chases large holdings on the understanding that
he will have secure possession; then if you tax
him more heavily than others, and (perhaps) so
heavily that the selling price of his asset is re-
duced, you, as the community, are repudiating
your contract with him. Once examined, this
argument dies, for these and other reasons :
(1) The community never promised the squatter that he
wouldn’t be taxed. The community of 1860 couldn’t
make promises either legally or ethically binding on the
community of 1910. Anyway, for all it knew, the com-
munity of 1910 might pass a law compelling all squatters
to rear goats instead of sheep, or to sow dragons’ teeth
instead of cocksfoot, and the community of 1860 could
give no guarantee against such enormities. Thesquatter
bought subject to this risk to himself and his descendants,
just as he bought subject to the risk of earthquake or
drought.
(2) The penal land-tax doesn’t even exercise the legal
(and moral) right of the community to limit individual
wealth, or to clip it when it grows dangerously large.
The large land-owner can escape the tax by selling his
land and turning it into some other sort of capital. If
he be a good man of business, he needn’t “sell at a
sacrifice.” If he be stupid, that is not the community’s
fault. The only command laid upon him is to change a
possession which makes him very obnoxious into a
possession which renders him less hostile to the general
good.
(3) Even if the Wrixon argument had any general
soundness, it is wholly inapplicable to Victorian
squatters, for whom he is supposedly pleading, for their
estates were mostly aggregated by a deliberate cheating
of the community in the first instance. They brokg,
the bargain first. And, in support of this, let The Bul-
letin quote the history of the Konongwootong South
Estate, repurchased for £lOO,OOO by the State of Victoria
two years ago. That land, when repurchased, formed a
small part of the trust estate of one deceased individual.
The area was originally sold under a Land Act which pro-
vided for its purchase in alternate lots of 640 acres each.
It was intended (and this was the bargain the com-
munity made) that a settler should buy one 640-acre
block, and lease the next, so that his sons might have it
when they grew up. Under this excellent contract, the
Konongwootong land was split into 70 blocks for sale.
By some means it was allotted originally to 30 applicants
instead of to 70 —so the bargain was broken at
the start. Very soon it was aggregated into
one holding, and so remained for 40 years an
obstacle to the growth of the town of Coleraine.
How was it aggregated? The Bulletin doesn’t know
what happened in the case of this particular estate.
But it knows what happened in many other cases. The
land-grabbing squatters hired grooms, valets, and other
dependents to select blocks, advancing them the pur-
chase-money. This money was lent by the squatter to
the groom or other flunkey for five years at 20 per cent,
per annum interest. It was an iniquitous loan, but when
a groom tried to upset it and keep his selection on fair
terms, the Courts upheld the squatter; and, of course,
the groom just handed over the land. As a rule, how-
ever, the “ dummy ’’ merely procured the holding for
the land-grabber, and received a tenner or two for his
immoral series. Such an owner has no legal bargain
with the community at all. He (or the person from
whom he bought the dummied land) cheated from the
very beginning, and immediately, from a moral and
ethical point of .view, forfeited practically all his rights
under the contract he had perverted.
Consequently, when the venerable WiuxoN
uses the ethical argument, he swings a sharp two-
edged sickle and cuts his own toe. Victorian
squatterdom in general had better keep its mouth
shut on the subject of ethics.

The Clumsy Device of Private Enterprise.
The Melbourne Tramway monopoly may have
the courage of its opinions, but it lacks at times
the discretion of its dividends. For instance, it
decided, the other day, that something ought to
be done to combat the dreadful proposal re a
Wages Board for tramway employees, and it shot
this document at its minions
SPECIAL NOTICE.
To the Employees—Gripmen, Conductors, Shedmen, etc.
Gentlemen, —As endeavors are now being made to bring
the company’s employees under the Factories Act and a
Wages Board, I ask you to say whether you wish to have
.a Wages Board, or are content with the present system
of management. Those in favor of the present system
are invited to express their opinions by signing a paper
to that effect in the line manager’s office to-day.
And the “gripmen, conductors, shedmen, etc.,”
leaped for joy like the wild ram on the moun-
tains, and trod each other under foot (the deaths
numbered ‘OOOl3 and there were "007 casualties)
in their haste to get into the office and sign this: —
In response to your notice asking us to say whether
we wish to have a Wages Board or are content with the
present system of management, we, the undersigned
employees at the above station, say we prefer to continue
under the present system of management.
Even if the business had ended there jt might not
have looked by any means too convincing, but it
didn’t end there. The monopoly would probably
give a good deal of money for' the name of the
employee who showed to Anstky, M.H.R., still
another document—a circular sent out to the
inspectors and shed bosses. It instructed these
officials to post everywhere, at 9 a.in', sharp, the
invitations to the employees to express their pro-
found satisfaction with things as they are. No
previous intimation was to be given, but, said the
circular :
If you can get the movement well started, the rest will
follow easily. The signing is all you want. Take all em-
ployees, of any class or occupation. ... Please telephone
progress and feeling shown to me about 12, 3 and 6
.o’clock. Please curtail your time off in middle of day to
bare necessary time for meals, so as to get out of touch
with this matter as little as possible. Get all men into
your office, and let them have an opportunity to sign if
willing, and on Tuesday,'if in any way possible, leaving
as few to Wednesday as you can.
Of course, knowing the service to be honey-
combed with spies, and taking it for granted that
those who didn’t rush gladly at the document
would be carefully noted for future reference, the
Tramway employees signed gaily. If it had been
a case of secret ballot, as at a general election, the
management might possibly have got two votes
against a Wages Board, but it being a public
affair, with the Eye of Him Who Giveth the Sack
glaring in the background, names were put down
freely. The thing was so clumsy and' outrageous
that it has made Parliamentary interference
almost inevitable. Thousands of people who
never before gave the matter much attention are
now satisfied that, in a service run on such lines,
a Wages Board is the least possible protection that
the men can do with. They reckon it must be a
very remarkable service which is so terrified lest
its methods should be inquired into, and thejr be-
gin to take an interest in these methods.

A Shallow, Overcrowded Port.
“Leo Leak” on the jamnation of Port Mel-
bourne :
All the schemes for the improvement of the Port of
Melbourne, to give it some chance of coping with the en-
larged trade of a State of 87,800 square miles, have
missed the simple common-sense turning which would
lead to a new port. Owing to the apparently dreadful
ignorance of public persons, I hasten to announce that in
the west of Victoria the very port for the job is waiting
for a meal from the rich 600 miles of country between
Melbourne and Adelaide. I refer to Portland, with its
800 yards-long pier, which, after many years, is still un-
occupied, except by a few sea-birds and a - lame
railway truck, for 360 days in the year. On the
other fifteen days an ocean liner puts in for frozen
meat from the local works. To utilise the
Portland sea-elephant to its utmost, the following are
required : (1) Connection with Port Fairy by rail, 43 miles
(already surveyed), to give the Warrnambool country its
proper sea outlet ; (2) Mount Ganrbier line of 60 miles, at
present surveyed as far as the border—this would save
the S.E. Crow-eaters the unnecessary haulage of their
[roods 305 miles to Adelaide over two gauges of rail; (3)
railway direct north front about Hamilton into the
Mallee ; (4) honest railway rates—not exorbitant charges
specially devised to drive trade away from Portland and
direct it to Melbourne. There is water enough in the
harbor of Portland for a dozen piers; and if a break.

In falsetto sing the everlasting Dirge.
For the squatter foameth madly in an apoplectic

And in unexampled anguish he doth urge
That Jokook shall yap like blazes, and the icy

And that even peaceful Paddy Glynn shall

Many weary times we’ve trotted towards damna-

’Twas ever thus that someone sang the Dirge !
But my heart is sad for Deakin as he sits in

His great sins against the populace to purge,
For his speech aforetime glittered with a national

And I never thought that Alfbed, with the tongue

Would attune it to the crying of the Dirge.

water were run out from the south point, the enclosed
space would float all Bull’s ironware from the latest
Dreadnought to the ship’s pinnace. Besides this, an in-
land dock could be constructed in a tidal swamp that
opens into the baj\ Any unprejudiced person looking at
this marsh would say it was placed there by Providence
when things were manufactured, for wet docks, dry
docks, sheds, shipping yards, railways, and all the rest
of the paraphernalia for the Liverpool of Victoria.
The entrance to Port Phillip is not such a deep con-
cern as it might be; and the day looms up when the
cargo boat, with its ever-increasing stature, will get into
communication with the bottom. The latest scheme—
the dredging of the Yarra—is the most crack-brained of
the lot. The big drain can carry ships drawing 2hft. or
25ft. of water, so 12ft. of bottom will have to be dug out
from the mouth to Queen’s Bridge, as well as large hunks
of land from the sides. Hereabouts a person might ask
how deep under mud the large sewerage drains are ? When
this earth-shifting is completed Victoria will have all its
shipping jammed in a corner like aherd of cows in a stock-
yard. Even a new pier at Port Melbourne is preferable to
dredging the Big Drain —it would at least split the con-
gestion somewhat. Finally, I pirate the “ Australian
Handbook’s ” opinion of Hobson’s Bay and Portland. Of
the former the unbiassed publication says : “ It has
water of from three to five fathoms, and accommodation
for 800 vessels.” The deserted port is described as “ abay
2U miles by 12, capable of affording anchorage for the
largest fleet in the loorld." I may say at once I didn’t dis-
cover this great port. It was in existence for many
years before I accidentally heard of it from an aged
blackfellow.
Smash and Whitewash.
The finding of the Special Board which sat to
consider the causes of the Richmond (Victoria)
railway disaster fulfilled The Bulletin's prophecy
to a hair. The massacre, it seems, “ was caused
by a succession of contraventions of the railway
regulations by a number of employees,” and the
employees are carefully enumerated. Well,
everybody guessed in advance that there would
have been no smash if some employee hadn’t
. broken some rule or other ; so it was hardly worth
laboring that point. What the public wants to
know is whether it is possible to avoid breaking
the rules, and whether it is not a fact that the
whole service would get bogged unless they were
broken. It is perfectly well known, for instance,
that there are rules which set forth that fog-
signallers should be on hand under certain condi-
tions and should do certain things, but it isn’t
known that there is any rule making Tait
or any other big gun responsible for (1)
providing the service with a sufficiency of
capable fog-signallers; (2) making sure that
they won’t be busy on other work when
they should be fog-signalling; and (3) making
arrangements for having them summoned if they
should be off duty when wanted, and if they
should happen, as many of them did in this case,
to live outside the fogged area and to have no idea
that their services were required. In the Rich-
mond case a tired-out man who hadn’t the
slightest experience of the work is said to have
been set to fog-signalling. If there is a regu-
lation which says, in effect, that he should
fog-signal properly whether he knows the
work or not, and no rule to say that
any man at the top shouldn’t let the service
run down so far that untrained men have to be
put to such work, then, of course, the man at the
bottom is technically responsible and the man at
the top isn’t. Similarly, if the regulations de-
clared that the night porter at Richmond should
paint a first-class landscape in oils, it would
evidently be a breach of the regulations if he
neglected to do it; and if any lives were lost for
want of that artistic masterpiece, the night porter
at Richmond would be plainly guilty of man-
slaughter. Again, the signalman who was re-
sponsible for observing or attending to between
20,00 and 3000 bells and levers in an hour ought not
to have made any hitch—the rules doubtless said
so. Even if he had had 20,000 bells and 30,000
lever-movements to be responsible for in a
minute, and the rules said that he must attend to
them all correctly, no accident would be possible
unless he neglected the blessed rules. But the
official habit of making a fetich of the rules grows
wearisome. Still, even officialdom has its brighter
intervals. One notable feature of the report is
that it doesn’t censure anybody for neglect of
the absurd*regulation by which, when a train is
bailed up, the guard or fireman is to go tramping
heavily up the line and hold verbal converse with
the harassed signalman as to the reason of the
trouble. It recognises that this amazing by-law
simply has to be broken, else the delay would
hang everything up on a crowded suburban
line. Having got that far the Board might as
well have inquired whether there were not other
impossibilities and absurdities on the list. Cer-
tainly it came very near to doing something of
the sort right at the beginning of its report, when
it set down the accident in great measure to the
fact that signalman McDonald was “ so anxious
to comply with regulation 64b.” It includes his
anxiety to comply with regulation 64b among the
alleged list of “contraventions of the railway
regulations,” and yet it goes so far as to say that
64b “ might be made more explicit.” In fact, its
complaint is that McDonald didn’t put the same
interpretation on 64b as other witnesses did ; so,
apparently, 64b is the vague sort of statute that may
be interpreted almost anyhow. What about a
new inquiry to find out who is responsible for
the haziness of regulation 64b ?
♦
The Board which inquired into the Richmond
(Vic.) railway smash hardly held a sitting with-
out happening across evidence of the casualness
of Tait’s department. Late in the proceedings it
encountered a laborer—an ordinary blue metal
distributor —who had been employed to assist the
fog-signallers and the ordinary signalman at
Richmond on the morning of the unpleasantness.
He knew nothing whatever of signalling, had re-
ceived no instructions as to his duties, and simply
did as his mates suggested. A fog-signaller told
him where to stand ; another told him to carry a
signalling kit about with him; and a third told him
to wave a green flag whenever a train passed him.
He doesn’t seem to have been told what to do
when two trains passed him simultaneously one on
top of another; but doubtless there is a regulation
dealing with such a case somewhere in Tait’s
voluminous miscellany. Nobody seems to have
thought it necessary to give the laborer proper
instructions. He just lobbed along and did the
best he knew—and the record to date is nine
killed and 455 injured.
♦
When one comes to think of it, the men who are
paid large salaries to manage the railways have
never been treated properly. They have been
cheated out of some of the honor and glory that
rightly belongs to them. Take, for comparison,
the case of a mine manager—in Victoria, at any
rate, and in most other places. If an accident
occurs in his mine it is prima facie evidence of
negligence. The law assumes that there should be
no accidents, and when they happen it
throws the responsibility on the manager of
pfoving that there wasn’t negligence. The
responsibility and the limelight might be
thrown on Bill Jones, miner ; but it isn’t. The
law doesn’t belittle the manager in that way.
He is the boss, the man who is paid for taking
responsibility, and it doesn’t rob him of what
belongs to him. So with a ship captain. When
his lugger bumps a rock or another vessel, it isn’t
Hans Larsen, the man at the wheel, who has
the honor of being thrown into the public’s eye.
It is the captain who, being paid for the responsi-
bility of getting the outfit safe to port, is asked
to meet the Murine Court and explain things. If
he can shake off his responsibility somebody else
may have to be talked to; but it is the captain
who has the honor of being talked to first.
The railway boss, however, is robbed right and left.
There is a train wreck, and somebody else—some
mere porter or engine-driver—is called up straight
away. The boss never gets a chance. He is
treated as a person of no account at all. The
railways might go along without him, so far as one
.ever hears about him when a train bumps a moun-
tain or does circus tricks over a precipice. It
seems to be time to at least put him on the same
footing as a ship captain, who usually doesn’t get
a quarter as much money, and, therefore, presum-
ably, in a commercial sense, isn’t of quarter as
much importance.

night after night without any extra pay ; yet
even while they are forced to toil for nothing,
other employees have been compelled to take
three weeks’ holiday without pay “ on account of
the slackness of trade ! ” Another employer, in
the same line of business, has bettered even that
rascality. He doesn’t pay his girls for overtime
either, but he at least gives them tea-money.
.And this is his generosity: he allows them 4d.

at his tea-rooms at a minimum cost of fid. each !
It is, in its way, a stroke of genius. A few years
ago Tasmania’s Government, moved by similar
tales, appointed a Royal Commission to investi-
gate the whole question of shop employment in
the Island State. That Commission’s report was
a blistering document, which any self-respecting
Government would either have suppressed at all
costs, or have acted on at once. But Tasmania's
Government did neither ; it just let things slide.
So those States where progressi veandhumane laws
are in force continue to be handicapped in their
trade competition with Vandemonia; and until the
whole matter is taken out of' the inert and lazy
hands of the State authorities, and transferred to
those of the Commonwealth, the federation of
Australia will remain incomplete.
Sydney Harbor Trust Commissioner Kkkle
seriously proposed the other day, before N.S.W.
Public Works Committee, that an outer harbor
should be made at Newcastle instead of opening
up Port Stephens. Keelk’s idea was to build
breakwaters in a semi-circle out in the ocean; and
thus make an artificial harbor at the present
entrance. Before Kkkle got his present job he
was in the Public Works Department, and the dust
which arose at his transfer has hardly settled yet.
Little love is lost between him and De Burgh,
the present principal engineer in the Depart-
ment. De Burgh made a scathing critcism of
Keele’s scheme. On its merits the idea is impos-
sible, and the cost of building the proposed complete
failure would be enormous. Why anyone should
suggest the creation, at an expense which must
run into millions, of an artificial harbor on an
open sea beach,- when there is a large, well-
sheltered deep-water port lying absolutely unused
and neglected alongside, is one of those events
which pass human comprehension.

From “Nearly Half-Seas Over”
In Sydney Harbor, on September 2, an episode occurred
which shows what might happen to the'modern passen-
ger ship, and what perhaps did happen to the Waratah.
The steamer Makambo, prior to leaving for the South
Se&s with passengers and cargo, was being topped off
with a large quantity of timber on the deck space. As
.the timber went aboard the vessel deepened in the
water until it was evident to the officers, that in
its then trim the whole consignment could not be
shipped without submerging the disc line. So, in
order to make room, the ballast tanks at the bottom
of the ship were emptied, and the heavy timber was all
nicely stacked on deck, leaving the load lines free on
each side. But when the ship got clearof the moral sup-
port of the wharf, it lurched over like a drunkard who
has suddenly disentangled himself from a telegraph pole.
Just when it looked as if it was going to repeat the
Austral,act by turning turtle on the spot, it managed to
scramble back to the wharf and hang on by, the skin of
its good luck or something, while the water that
had rushed in through the submerged openings
slopped about below and the passengers wiped
the cold perspiration from their browjs. Next
day the deck cargo was discharged, and the re-
trimmed vessel put to sea in good order. This happened
in Sydney Harbor in smooth water; but it is easy to
suppose conditions in which the emptying of the ballast
tanks might cause a vessel to lose its foothold, so to
spefak, when a handy wharf was not available to lean up
against. The Makambo incident has revived the theory
that Captain Ilbery emptied the Waratah’s ballast tanks
for some reason, leaving a top-heavy ship and a whole
hog gale to argue it out between them.

The breaking of a record in an estimable
cause is always worthy of mention, but the per-
formance of Miss Nellie Stewart, who won £l4OO
for the Radium for the Poor Fund, deserves to
be written in wine on a rose-leaved scroll after the
manner of the scribe in the Persian poem. Sydney
Royal, where the charity matinee of “Sweet Nell”
was given on Monday, is not a big theatre, yet
it held £750 worth of humanity. Since the day
when Catherine Hayes, the singer, raised £lOOO
for the asylum at Randwick, nothing like Miss
Stewart’s achievement has been done in Aus-
tralia. To be accurate, £l5OO was the rake-in,
but there are some expenses that cannot be
dodged, and they were bought off with a
century of money. Mr. George Musgrove
and Mr. Claude McKay did work that
usually cries aloud for disbursements of coin,
and didn’t even employ typists. “The end
justifies the means,” remarked J.C.W.’s private
secretary,"resignedly, as he allowed a big spray of
white flowers to be pinned on his coat between
the shoulders. A Man of Consequence, being
asked by a girl who was selling for the Cause to
buy the spray for a few shillings, replied he would
give a pound for it if the secretary would wear it
on his back for some hours. That’s how that
pound was impounded. For four days before the
theatre performance Miss Stewart sold Luce’s eau
de Cologne at a shop in George-street for an hour
a day, and the cheque the agents for the perfume
sent her for the sales was £lBl. She sold at the
rate of bottles a minute. The money realised by
her personally in the theatre by sales of oranges,
sweets and portraits and the signing of auto-
graph books was £B4. A poor small boy was the
winner in the Nell Gwynne doll raffle. He had
bought the ticket from Miss Stewart herself in
the street on condition she autographed it. An
immensely gratifying phase of this money-spin-
ning event was that it wuis a transaction between
Miss Stewart and the multitude. There was no
vice-regal patronage or presence and no Society in-
fluence. From the country came numerous postal-
notes for sums as low as a shilling, and an intima-
tion that the sender wished the work every success
because his or her father or mother or other rela-
tive had died of cancer. The performance itself
went splendidly, and at its conclusion the tea
served on the stage and the auctioning of gift
articles helped to swell the fund.

The last “Orchid” showmen that the
present paragraphist met before he turned in at
Her Majesty’s (Sydney) didn’t work on quite the
same lines as J.C. W., Ltd. It was at Buitenzorg,
in the wonderful tropical gardens that the Dutch-
men have made in the East Indies, where orchids
grow like potatoes —or as potatoes would grow if
they knew how to exist on trees. ' The
Buitenzorg gardens ramble over a great area,
the Governor-General’s humpy being set in
the midst of them; and no sooner does
the visitor get within them than a cohort
of small boys bears down upon him and fires off
three of the four English words it knows —“ Big
trees,” “orchids.” You don’t want a cohort for
a guide, so you pick out one, and he shows you
one patch of orchids, growing mostly on the
slender trunks of the frangipanni. Then he holds
out his hand and says his other English—
“Presen’.” You give his fee, and promptly
another member of the cohort, steps forward and
says, “More orchid,” and takes you to another
patch. And when he has shown you round that
patch, he holds out his hand and says “ Presen’.”
Then another section of the cohort steps up and
says “Orchid,” and points vaguely ; and you take
him ou ; and he gets his “present.” But after
the fifteenth (or so) conspirator has had you in
tow, you begin to suspect that you have seen some
of these orchids before ; whereupon the cohort
vanishes to pick up another unsophisticated
tourist. It is a lot more comfortable to let the
limber Leslie pursue the orchid and bring it to you,
or to let Meakin grow it for you in the hothouse
at the young ladies’ horticultural college. It isn’t
so damp underfoot, and the raindrops haven’t
such a habit of falling down your neck in
gallons from overhead. How long the present
season of vegetable-hunting is to continue at
Her Majesty’s hasn’t yet been announced ; but the
gentle voice of the stage-manager has been heard
whispering soft words of encouragement as the
co. gets ready for “Our Miss Gibbs,” and as
“Our Miss Gibbs ” is due on the 24th inst., pre-
sumably “The Orchid” will last till then.

By The Bulletin’s art critic :
Each year, when the trustees of the National Art
Gallery have finally refused to purchase any more
gems, and the printed remarks of the horse-
reporters who are sent to “do” the Royal
Art Society’s show (apparently in mistake for the
Royal Agricultural Society’s show) are no longer the sub-
ject of rage and astonishment, the R.A.S. buries the axe
for one night and welcomes its friends and its enemies
with equal good feeling at a Smcke-0 in its rooms, Pitt-
street, Sydney. Even politicians are permitted to enter :
the press critics are urged to have a drop of something, in
a voice that removes suspicion of arsenic ; the blue,
sinuous tobacco-smoke curls itself voluptuously across
the hundred tints of oils ; and all is peace and fillemep-
again. Thus it was on Saturday night when the annual
gathering brought together','in addition to a large
number of members of the Society whose exhibition is now
open, a party of outsiders whose intentb ns towards the
Aims of Art are understood to be strictly honorable, if
not benevolent. Wealthy buyers were not present, but
what of that? The rich patron is not always the best
friend of Art; many an artist’s reputation might be en-
hanced by so lowly an individual as a burglar or an in-
cendiary. Besides, large, stout persons often eat too much,
especially when the feed is gratis. Consider* the position
if a large, wealthy citizen had died during the proceedings
on Saturday night through an overload of beer and sponge
cake or whisky and oyster rolls ! It would have inter-
fered with the concert; in fact it would have cast a
gloom over the whole programme. Necessarily, some-
body would have had to go for a wheelbarrow'or cart to
remove the body—it couldn’t be dropped down the lift-
well nor shoved under a seat —and while waiting for the
vehicle the company would naturally take a good-sized
nip or two to steady its nerves ; and one or two might
lead to finishing the bottle, and the last man to be
helped, finding only quarter of a nip or no nip at all,
might in his anger heave the' dead marine through a
50-guinea sunset, which would certainly lead to
a free fight wherein infuriated and unbridled persons
would batter each other with valuable works of art until
the police arrived.
Nothing of the kind occurred on Saturday night. The
guests sat round like church deacons on a visit to the
manse, while singers from the local schools of vocalism
or gunnery or something sang “’fhe Bandy Hero,” and
other classics, or did lightning sketches at elephant
speed, or played on the pianoforte and other musical
instruments selections from Mozart, Dumas and John L.
Sullivan. Between times the deacons walked round
and had another look at the pictures, or chewed
a boiled ham sandwich reflectively while remarking
that Australia was undoubtedly forming a distinctive
race of color concep.tionalists, who were certain in the
long run to remove the last traces of the aboriginal school
of copyists that was founded by Dante, the painter of
“ Paradise Alley.” Even the press critics who Were pre-
sent at the supper table admitted this, and the ad-
mission cemented the beginning of a life-long friendship,
which should be to the advantage of both parties. The
Critics are to be made honorary members of the art
classes, and the artists, in their own interests, will teach
them the difference between a water-color and a water-
melon.
That’s how it stood when the last bottle was squeezed
dry on Saturday night, and it had all Sunday to get over
it before starting work.

Since last Bulletin, two cheering turns
have been added to the amusement wheel of
Sydney Tivoli. The first of the new revolutions
is provided by an Australian quartette party
which sings under the sign “The Australian Gold
Diggers” ; the other whirl is given by Harry and
Nellie Quealy, who rush hilariously through a
musical farce entitled “Fun in a Kitchen.”
There is a certain amount of frenzy in every
kitchen ; fire, steam, haste and the smell of food
■make for excitement and disaster, and the wildest
things are possible. As a setting for a farce, a
disordered kitchen is about the best a dramatist
could choose. Consideration of the humorous
Quealy trifle suggests that an artesian supply of
fun is here awaiting the pen-bore of some person
possessed of sufficient time and courage to write
for the stage. He might, if he liked, have
seven scenes in his play—the kitchen, the roof,
the coal-cellar, the scullery, the backyard, the

Arthur Adams’s new play, “The Wasters,”
produced for the first time by the Literary Theatre
in Adelaide, is a domestic tragedy. John Dangar
is a big Sydney shopkeeper. His only son, forced
unwillingly into the business, has embezzled £2OO.
Clibborn, the accountant, discovers this, and
demands a partnership as the price of silence.
Dangar refuses. Then his wife desperately takes
a hand to save her son. The boy is Clibborn’s
own. Dry old stick as he is now, he must have
had some fascinations 20 years ago. He was
always about the house, Dangar was engrossed in
business, and “ the inevitable happened,” though
even Clibborn never suspected the consequence.
That is all the play. It might end in half a dozen
ways. It really finishes with a discourse by
Lindsay Thong, a Cayley-Drummle-like friend
of the family. He talks much worldly good
sense, and convinces Dangar that, failing the
best —wife or anything else—it is well to stick to
the second best. There is a scene in the trying-
on room for underskirts in the Dangar emporium
that will make the play popular, but its gloomy
theme is against it. Further, Lindsay, while
cherishing a chivalrous, hopeless love for Mrs.
Dangar, is a terror with other women, and
pursues a charming shopgirl round the furniture
in quite the Marcus-and-Mercia manner. The
comic relief is really relief, and really comic.
Adams has a quaint taste in proper names:
Thong, Maggs, Goodsir, Quork and Cronk. The
“ Wasters” of the title are women in general—all
parasites, as Dangar tells his wife in an excited
moment; to which she replies neatly that he, as
a prosperous draper, is a “ parasite on parasites.”
The dialogue is strong, but needs cutting. Mr.
Adams—who made a flying visit to see the play
produced—was fortunate in his interpreters for
the most part. As the Dangar couple Wilfrid
Neill and Mabel Hardinge scored heavily. The
latter is a clever young professional actress. But
the crowded house gasped audibly when it heard
she had been married 23 years, for she looked no
more than that. Of the others, Douglas Walsh
and Ivy Stacey stood out for their perfectly
natural acting as Marcus and Mercia.

The rest of Adelaide’s shows—barring
flickers—are mostly musical : Mendel at the
Tivoli, and Carrefio at the Exhibition, which last
is a trying show-place for a pianist.

“ 0.K.,” from Melbourne :
At the Guildhall an interestingly diversified art show
will remain open until the end of this vveek. Billed as an
“ Exhibition of Pictures and Drawings by Arthur
Streeton, George Lambert and Hardy Wilson,” plus a
“ Selection of Pans, Textiles, etc., of the 16th to 18th
centuries,” it is more of an entertainment for art-lovers
than a conventional gathering of pictures. For one
thing, it is free from all arrogant display of incompetent
workmanship. Everything is worth looking at. The oil
paintings are few and good. Streeton is represented by
four only, the most important being another of his high-
view studies of Sydney Harbor, in which the painting of
the water is as charming as the rest of the picture. There
are 10 Lamberts in oils, including the artist’s masterly
portrait of himself. The two largest in all respects
—“The Blue Hat” and “Lotty and the Lady”—strike
one as belonging to an earlier period than even their
venerable ornate gilt frames. Streeton’s big picture is
also dignified by a mellow gilt frame, but there is nothing
of the “old master" about that , whereas Lambert’s
work is a bold departure from modern style. The Blue
Hat is practically a portrait group placed in a garden,
with a bit of Gainsborough tree in the background. Pine
coloring and the charm of strength are in it. You get
the impression that the artist is a master waiting to
grow old. There is no appeal to rigidly modern
taste, nor, on the other hand, is there any anti-
quated unrealism about the figures. The composi-
tion of “Lotty and the Lady” is more harsh
in effect than the larger picture. The two women
seem, at a first glance, too big for the kitchen background,
and most people will complain that they are not nearly
so convincing as the dead fish lying on a plate on Lotty’s
table. But the stiffness of these figures wears off. The
picture stays in the mind of the observer, and improves
on acquaintance. It possesses a durable interest even for
the average eye, which cares n thing for technique as
technique, but is open to be beguiled by an indefinable
effect. Among Lambert’s water colors the dramatic,
despairful presentment of Burke, Wills and King is
notably strong, whilst the “Departure from Lina”
(19) is Turneresquely charming. Twenty or 30
drawings in pencil, crayon and chalk testify further
to the advance that Lambert has made in
his art since he left Australia. He has done more than
advance ;he has actually arrived. Hardy Wilson contri-
butions are not less interesting in their way than the
Lambert and Streeton works. He shows a number of
formal measured drawings of classic architecture ; also a
number of pencil bits of old Italian buildings, gardens
and fountains, together with some most interesting
sketches of 18th century American dwelling-houses, and
many views of the stately Capitol. The collection of fans
and fabrics is worth an hour or two of close inspection.
Some of the Chinese carving and European work in silk
and silver thread is remarkable.

At Her Majesty’s (Melb.), the grand opera
season, that shone with largely diminished
grandeur in “ Bohibme ” and “ Carmen,” is being
concluded with some extra revivals of “ Butter-
fly.” The first-named operas served the manage-
ment’s turn during Show week, but in both cases
the performance emphasised the shortcomings of
the co. If it was. hard to take a serious view
of Amy Castles as the sick and sentimental
Mimi, when she had Blarney for her singing
partner, it was harder to repeat the illusion
when Reginald Roberts assumed the tenor
character. There was at least a harmony
of lethargic plumpness between Blarney and the
prima-donna; but the strenuous Roberts was
neither plump nor invariably tuneful. And if
“ Boheme” came far below the original standard
fixed by Bassich, Dani and eo. of yore, the per-
formance of “Carmen” was even less satisfactory.
In Puccini’s operas (especially in “Butterfly”)
the dramatic action is subordinate to the music.
In “Carmen” the music is of less importance
than the acting. Bel Sorel has nothing of the
ideal Carmen about her —except in J.C.W.’s
advt. She has not the right quality and strength
of voice, or supple grace of figure and movement,
or an absolutely fascinatingstage personality with a
she-devilish suggestion in it. There was no force
in her acting. Probably she felt the cruelty of
her fate, for she had to fall a victim to the
jealousy of Blarney owing to her unpardonable
passion for Arthur Crane, the Toreador, who'
looked very like an Anglican curate in fancy
dress. All the sympathies of the audience were
absorbed by Miss Buckman as Michaela, although
hers was only a comparative success. The wel-
come “ Butterfly ” revival will keep the season
going until Saturday. From Monday to Friday,
next week, the theatre will be closed, and on
Saturday (17th) the first production of “The'
Whip ” will come to pass. Meanwhile a curious
public is asking : “ What’s the matter with Pam-'
pari? ”
** * *
“Pete” is proceeding as before at Mel-
bourne Royal. The lamentable fact that Kate
Cregeen's husband is not baby’s doting parent
can no longer be questioned. The lady has stated
it in the presence of fairly large audiences every
night for the last three weeks.
** * *
The Town Hall of Melbourne has been
looming large in the advertisements. Last
Saturday the Conly-Kirby concert brought the
organ into play, and gave the soprano a chance to
raise her fine voice above the rousing chorus of
Beard’s Festival Choir. The city should be ready
for another short series of Conly-Kirby concerts
later in the year.
** * *
Carreno returns to the Town Hall plat-
form on Saturday. She has been to Maoriland
and Adelaide since Melbourne heard her not
many weeks ago, and is still in a hurry, seemingly.
This time Carrefio is to give four recitals, and the
last of them will be no later than Wednesday of
next week. After which the remarkable artist
will take up her piano and flv elsewhere.
** * *
At the Princess’s, the question as to what
Mr. Howard Jeffries, senior, said to his wife after
the curtain fell will soon be a forgotten mystery.
The romantic drama of “Henry of Navarre”
falls due on Saturday, when Melbourne will re-
sume its acquaintance with the Julius Knight of
earlier days—Julius, gay and debonair, heroic in
courtship and war and adorably caparisoned.
Julius, lately, has been disguising himself as an
elderly paternal citizen of the strictly businesslike
persuasion; so tbe girls will be glad to see him
again with a feather in his hat and burning words
of love upon his lips.

The forthcoming change of bill at the
King’s is awaited with patriotic pleasure, not
unmingled with anxiety*. William Anderson; who
on previous occasions has provided Australian
bellowdrama with a local habitation and q, fame,
is making his first attempt to manufacture the
goods he sells. “The Winning Ticket,” an-
nounced for Saturday, is “a picturesque Australian
drama of sporting life, by William Anderson and
Temple Harrison,” and its scenes of Melbourne
interest extend from St. Kilda-road to Fleming-
ton. George Darrell produced bellowdrama of the
same sort at a time when the imported article was
usually better, and more generally esteemed for
its Englishness, than it is nowadays. The con-
ditions have changed. A public that can find
delight in the “Sins of Seven Dials,” or “A
Cockney’s Curse,” or what not, should be ready
to go frantic over “ The Winning Ticket,” which
will make a bid for the patronage of Judkins by
introducing a raid on the two-up school in Little
Bourke-street.
** * *
The picture of “ An Angry Sea,” at West’s
Melbourne Palace, suggests that there is grandeur
in Uproar and beauty in Chaos. It is a fine
film, depicting the sea whipped into a powerful
and impressive rage. A blessed story of the
Amurkan civil war is “In the Border States,”
showing the adventures of two fugitives and an
heroic che-ild. Another good item is an edition
of “The Path 6 Gazette,” illustrating further
news and notes from manywheres.” But “The
Face at the Window.” —which is no relation to a
certain bellowdrama—desperately troubles the
present writer. It is really a sermon on Drink ;
but one doubts whether to weep over it or to
shriek with merriment.

Nothing has altered for the worse at the
Opera House since the merits of the present pro-
gramme were frankly acknowledged in this
earnest Christian publication. Powell and Vesey
are still the latest arrivals, and their “turn,”
described as “a dualogue,” is more than a mere
interchange of questions and answers interrupted
by songandance. It has leanings towards comedy
and moments of real humor. Many things are
humorous at the Opera House just now. Acro-
batic wonders and musical marvels are off the bill
of fare, and even the juggling is of a jocular
nature.

Randolph Bedford is back from China,
Japan and the United States, chiefly from the
last-named place, with a heap of stories about the
Sodom of San Francisco and the Gomorrah of
New York. The fact that there are good stories
to be told about these places is patent to every
reader of U.S. literature. It is only necessary to
give a general order for one ton of Uncle Sum’s
printed matter, and then wade through it. The
stories will pan out something like this: —

Randolph Bedford may possibly lecture through
his nose on what he has seen. The yarn of the
Chewing Gum Trust and the tale about the pri-
mary election for an alderman in the back room
of a cigar shop on “Sixt’ Avenoo” would lose
more than half their flavor if told in any other
way.
Private letters from Hugh J. Ward, who recently
shook the last spare dollar out of Wellington (M.L.)to
erect a Children’s Hospital, state that over £5OOO was
collected, collared, annexed, waylaid or bushranged in 10
days, and that money was still coming in. With the
State subsidy of 245. for every 20s. subscribed, the Man
from Mexico estimates that the hospital will have be-
tween £12,000 and £13,000 to commence life with.
“0.K.”: The latest performance of “Carmen” in
Melbourne was, barring the orchestral part, the least
satisfactory that I can recall. The most satisfactory,
perhaps, was given by Simonsen’s English and Italian Opera
Co. in 1888 ; but these very old events are only vaguely
remembered. In the Simonsen show the name part was
taken by Louise Lablache; an Italian tenor named
Dimitresco played Don Jose; and Pimazzoni was the.
Toreador. The three voices were fine and large, and the
lady shone as an actress. Little Flora Graupner,
too, with her youthful appearance and bright
clear voice, made her mark as Micaela. The next
notable attempt at “Carmen” in Melbourne was
made by Williamson’s Comic Opera Co. at the
Princess’s —and that was 18 years ago. Marie Halton,
an American prima donna, gave a spirited performance of
the giddy girl; Flora Graupner was Micaela again, and
Ryley cut a dash as the Toreador. Florence Young and'
Violet Varley, also Howard Vernon, Leumane and Allan
Morris (a charming light baritone) were in the cast; but
the tenor (William Walshe) was just a sweet warbler
with no dramatic experience or ability. Ten years ago
Bizet’s opera got a more forcible presentation by George
Musgrove’s co. This time Agnes Jansen sang and
acted Carmen, whilst Salvi supported her very
capably as Don Jose. A huge baritone Max
Eugene—fancied himself immensely in the Toreador
character, and Lilian Coomber made an excellent Micaela.
The cast was otherwise pretty good, and Slapoffski had a
sufficiently strong orchestra under his command. ' Each
of these three w’ay-back performances of “Carmen ” was
stronger in its general effect than the one that Melbourne
saw last week. In every case the prima donna was better
suited to her music than is Bel Sorel, and the Toreador
and Don Jose were a more interesting pair than Arthur
Crane and Blarney. But there has never been a
“ Carmen ” performance without conspicuous faults
in it. Other operas have received better treatment in this
country.
Labor-member Woods, of Tasmania, men-
tioned in the Assembly the other evening that
“a well-known clergyman ” had told him circum-
stantial tales about horrible sweating in Hobart
dress-shops. “Name, name!” cried Fat, taking
what looked like the easiest way to discredit the
yarn. Then Woods surprised Fat: not only did
he name his clergyman, but the clergyman was a
Bishop —the vigorous little Mercer who periodi-
cally startles the torpid Anglicans of the Speck.
What yoarticularly distresses Fat at the moment
is that he was just getting ready to heave the
Wages Board Bill out of the House of Propputy ;
and Mercer’s “interference” has made the heave
awkward- Still, Fat may bring himself to do it;
and if he does, the little Bishop looks like starting
an agitation to do a heave of another sort.

pleted for the coming N.S.W. general election.

AT POVERTY POINT.
No bigger boom was ever given a showman in M.L.
than Hugh Ward received from the parsons at Welling-
ton over “ The Girl from Rector’s.” The day before the
season opened, Rev. Dr. Gibb, thie principal Scotchby-
terian minister, made a whole-souled protest from his
pulpit thus: —“ I denounce this play as Satanic. It is a
beastly—glittering, but none the less beastly—appeal to
the basest passions. It holds marriage and love up to
mockery. It is pornography rendered tenfold more
deadly by the fascination of wit and beauty and dress,
with which the play is said to be invested. It is deplor-
able. nay, it is horrible, that men and women should be
permitted to descend to the level of beasts by such exhi-
bitions. It is damnable that our sons and daughters
should be exposed to the contamination of witnessing
their degradation. . . . The police will hale before the
magistrates a woman for solicitation in the streets, but
here is a play which will do as much harm to the morals
of a large section of the community as a regiment of
courtesans. The situation is monstrous." And Parson J. J.
North cut loose in equally whole-souled fashion. He said :
“ No one will go to this play without knowing that they
are going to look upon that which should cover an honest
man’s face with red shame, and make a woman, for her
mother’s sake and for the sake of her sex, ashamed to
stay. This company may find 5000 people in this city
who will crowd the Opera House and gloat over the
brilliant lusts of debauched woman and lecherous men,
but the action of the press of this country makes it cer-
tain that only the moral scum of the city will dare to go.
Naturally, the theatre was crowded. And the morning
after the performance the Dominion (the most strait-laced
of the Wellington newspapers), in a leading article, de-
clared that “The Girl from Rector’s” was “more whole-
some than many comedy-farces against which no outcry
has been raised. It would be difficult, if not impossible,
to find a phrase or a word in any of the four acts to which
exception can be taken on the ground of propriety. ’
This looked bad for the advertisement till Parson Gibb
got off the mark again with the announcement that
“Olga Nethersole has, for the past 15 years, been intro,
ducing this harlot type of drama into the United States.”
His statement brought the M.L. correspondent of the
London Era into the shindy, and he wrote to the press with
a hot ember: “Ido not know what is meant by the ‘harlot
type of drama’ any more than Messrs. Gibb and North
would attach any sense to the phrase i harlot type of
sermon.’ If, however, the suggestion is that this emi-
nent lady uses the medium of her art to glorify the pros-
titute, I say this statement is as false as the others.”
Then Hugh Ward grabbed a scheme by the neck to build
a children’s hospital, and put £lOO into it, and arranged
a matinde to bring in another £3OO, and worked out an
idea to provide about £3OOO more, and the Governor was
made a member of the committee, and Grace Palotta sold
the tickets on an auctioneer’s stand, and the police had
their uniforms torn off keeping the crowd from breaking
into the theatre at 6 p.m. daily, and every time Ward
showed himself in the street the pedestrians dragged him
into 50 pubs simultaneously, and Reg Wykeham had the
time of his life, and the parson’s name was Mud, and
Teddy Geach says if he could have got a moving-picture
of the howl and hallelujah he’d have his fortune.
People who did not patronise the Grand Commonwealth
Eisteddfod, just closing in Sydney, will never know the
fun they missed. All sizes, sorts and conditions of per-
formers—good. bad and indifferent—Eisteddfodded. One
evening, when I arrived, the bagpipes were skirling and a
small girl in a kilt, with laced petticoats and bloomers,
was whirling over two crossed swords. Eight other small
girls then whirled over the cutlery, some to the tum-tum
of the piano. After that the skewers were removed, and
curtains were pulled back to reveal a lady in a “nightie,”
with long brown hair streaming down her back and a
little, round saucer-cap on her head, looking sorrow-
fully into the atmosphere. I learnt afterwards
that she was Juliet looking for Romeo. She acted
the “Potion Scene” and fell dead most grace-
fully. Then a young lady in a blue frock and red shoes
gave an imitation of a French girl telling a tragic story
about Pierrot in broken English. The soprano solo com-
petitors followed. They sang “Is This Love t ” and “ Let
the Bright Seraphim.” Some were fair Bingers and some
were awful. The latter were the best sport. Still, I
don’t want any more love in that key or any more bright
seraphim either. Then 16 small girls danced Irish jigs,
pounding the platform like so many young elephants. A
hakais a lullaby in comparison. After that a piano solo
ten times. I will recognise that “ Spring Song ” 1000 years
hence. As a grand finale there was a “ serio-comic song and
dance ” by four terrible infants, each more terrible than
the last. Some wore tights. Some, alas ! did not. And
the one boy won the cake. The man who came from
London to judge things put his head down on the table
and wept. It was a great performance, taking it all to-
gether ; and if the Eisteddfod people can cure some of the
starters of the singing and serio-comic habit, they will
deserveanyof the medals that are left over.
The Religious Editor : The mail account of the death
of British airman C. S. Rolls at the Bournemouth avia-
tion meeting in July, is depressing reading save in one
place—that where it tells how the camera ghoul who
to the fatal spot in a motor and. persisted in
snapshotting the crushed remains—had his camera
wrested from him and trampled to death beneath the
indignant feet of two stewards. The accounts state
that the trampling was “ greeted with applause ” by the
crowd, but it neglects to mention what refuse was
thrown at the Dry-Plate Buzzard. Though the blood-
photographer doesn’t seem to realise the fact, his blind
eagerness to beat the undertaker to the scene of death
revolts the public. Almost every white man travels
occasionally by rail or steamer, and he hates to think
that, in the event of a bad accident, the same vulture
may swoop down, snap his corpse and include it in his
series of “ Mangled Bodies Being Removed from the
Wrecked Carriages,” or “Bodies Awaiting Identification
on the Beach.” Many men have a strong objection to
being photographed when they are alive and well; their
objection to being photographed when they are lying
dead in a public place is something tremendous.
H. P. Lyons (of Melbourne), the father of advance
agents and a well-known identity of theatres, circuses,

THE STAINLESS MUMMER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Mr. W. T. Stead, who spoke on the “Influence of the
Stage on Morals,” said that the presence of 12 curates in
the Divorce Court was of less consequence than that of
one actor.— London Daily Mail (1617/’10).
What if mere curates dive with zest
Into sin’s seething; sea,
And do their stipends in at cards,
And flirt outrageously ?
Who cares?—so long as Actors keep
Their pristine purity.
The world is certainly perturbed
To see a vicar tight;
(Whether the holy man be calm
Or clamorous for fight),
And yet it grieves far more to view
A mummer in such plight.
Archdeacons can, at intervals,
Enjoy a hot old time ;
Even a bis! ;> may be gay,
Nor stand accused of crime
But these remarks do not apply
Unto the spotless mime.
He stands above the common herd
That pray and preach and bless,
As pines o’ertop the garden plants
That round about them press,
A superman —the prototype
Of utter holiness.

“Laughter,” when printed in brackets in
newspaper reports, seems to denote the vacant
mind more often than not. In the Vie. Assembly
the other day member McLeod remarked that some-
thing “ reminded him of George IV., who used to
say he had won the battle of Waterloo.” Where-
upon member Lemmon interjected, “George 111.,
was i t not ? ” And the reporters noted “ (Laug h ter). ”
If the House took Lemmon’s correction for gospel
and laughed at McLeod, it was guffawing at the
wrong nian, anyhow. Not that McLeod was quite
correct in his anecdote. The story goes that George
IV. used to ask the Duke of Wellington to back
up his assertion that he had led a charge of
cavalry at Waterloo, but it is not said that the
royal liar claimed the achievement of Bill Adams.
NO SENSE OF DECENCY.
I went through two small sections of our public parks.
Those sections were chosen by a friend and myself at
random. We went in at a gate from the roadway, and
there on a little green spot, about the same size as this
church, were 30 couples, taking no more notice of
passers-by than if they did not exist. (Cries of “Shame!”
and “Awful!”) At another place, in a nark not much
bigger, if we saw one we saw one hundred couples.

“0.K.”: Charles Bailey, the precious
“ medium ” who produces “apports” at spiritu-
alistic meetings, and delivers incoherent addresses
under the alleged inspiration of defunct persons,
is back in Melbourne from his disastrous trip to
Europe. A credulous Yankee —one Professor
Reichel—came to Melbourneearly in thisyeartobe
duly impressed by the performances of Bailey at
the house of Mr. Stanford, where The Lone Hand
had previously become acquainted with the
“ medium.” Reichel offered to pay the expenses
of taking Bailey to Europe; and Bailey went.
The Bulletin has already told how, at
Grenoble, Colonel de Rochas and six scientists
bowled him out in one of his old familiar frauds.
The outcome of this latest exposure is quite
pathetic. None of the believers relinquished an
iota of their faith in mediuruship. Reichel
and Stanford and his'“ circle” continue to believe
even in this particular humbug’s pretensions.
The precious “apports” that Bailey produces
in complete darkness are, it seems, none the less
Egyptian or Indian because he may have bought
them previously in Melbourne. The Harbinger
of Light, in a recent issue, said :
It has never been certain whence the “apports " came.
In a subtle and little-understood sense the sensitive’s
magnetism has to be used in this materialising and de-
materialising process that “apport ’’-bringing implies.
Id has been known to Mr. Stanford that Charles Bailey
has bought birds in Melbourne, and there is no manner
of doubt that anything which could be magnetised by
the medium would he more easily manipulated by those
on the spirit side of life. It is possible that Bailey may
have bought these birds [at Grenoble], and yet they
might be as genuine “ apports” as anything else.
So if Bailey walked into the midst of the Stanford
circle with a loaf of bread under bis arm, and
turned the gas out, and presently told the circle
that he had sent tneloaf to India, and desired his
friends, “the Indians,” to bring it back in five
minutes, the folk of his circle would accept the
same old loaf ot bread as a genuine “apport”
when the gas was turned on again. Also, they
would discover mystic evidences of Bailey’s mag-
netism in the crust thereof. Some of them, at
least, would be thus gullible. It is not conceiv-
able that they are all genuine “ believers.’’ Mr.
Stanford is understood to be a very wealthy
citizen, and possibly some of them hope to reap
advantage hereafter from his susceptibility to—
well, spiritual influence.

“ Billy B.” ; New South Wales’s patriotic
and energetic Agent-General Coghlan made hash-
pie in the London Standard of Foster Fraser’s
book about Australia. Most of Oognlan’s main
criticisms have already been published, but one
small gem deserves repetition. Says the Agent-
General :
I do not wish to trespass unduly on your space, other-
wise I might ask you to find space for the correction of
certain curious statements, such as that 20,000,000 acres
are under fruit trees in a State [Tasmania] which em-
braces only 17,000,000 acres.
Ihe two main points that Fraser made in reply
were (1) that the criticisms were “silly and
ignorant remarks ” ; (2) that Coghlan was annoyed
because he (Fraser) would not accept pay-
ment of his hotel bills and steamer fares by
Premier Wade, who, he seems to hint, had a view
to bribing the London journalist to boost emigra-
tion to New South Wales. The virtuous Phraser
puts it this way :
When I arrived in Sydney the Premier, Mr. Wade, most
courteously offered me the hospitality of the SlaLe. I
declined, for, as I told Mr. Wade, if I was the guest of
New South Wales, how could I, as a journalist, write
absolutely freely and unbiased? . . . But I allowed no-
thing to interfere with my independence. What Mr.
Coghlan would have liked would be that I should have
had my steamboat fares and my hotel bills paid for me—
which Mr. Coghlan well knows is sometimes done—and
that then I should have allowed myself to he the mouth-
piece of immigration agents who want English farmers
with money to do what comparatively so few Australians
are doing for themselves. Jam not that kind of jour-
nalist.
Which, when the charge is one of putting
20,000,000 acres of fruit trees in an island of
17,000,000 acres, seems singularly evasive, not to
say bumptious and asinine. Another of Phraser’s
wild blunders was his statement that the merino
sheep degenerates in Australia, and is only kept
up by the importation of fresh blood from Eng-
land. One very good reason why there is no such
importation is that the poor old merino lady
doesn’t live in England at all. She can’t stand
the climate, just as is the ease with the elephant
in Greenland.

The remarkable history of some tinned
butter has just been traced by the Victorian Agri-
cultural people. The fat was first heard from” at
Tientsin (China), where it was behaving in such a
riotous manner that the British Consul men-
tioned it to the Victorian trade agent. Sinclair,
the trade agent, couldn’t understand why Vic-
torian butter should behave in that way, and
asked the Ministry to trace its historv. Then
it was discovered that the stuff originally
left Victoria nine years ago , as part of a consign-
ment of army supplies to S’Africa. At the close
of the unpleasantness it was sold with other job
lots to certain Cold Country contractors, and had,
presumably, been lying in some warehouse ever
since, accumulating age and other bad habits.
Finally, it appears to have become uncontrollable,
so it was passsed on to the simple, childlike Chow!

which arose out of the fury of a husband who

In London these days the literary sensa-

Wonderful are the possibilities of this sort of

South Australia, which is supposed to have
a particular affection for the contrite heart, is not
sure that the thing can’t be overdone. A while
back one Roberts, who had escaped from gaol in
Adelaide, was arrested on another charge
in Ballarat. The force duly notified
its S’Australian brethren that Roberts
was on hand and available for ex-
port, as it were; but S. Aus. curtly
replied that it considered itself well
rid of Roberts, and, anyhow, it
wasn’t going to spend good casli in
bringing such an encumbrance all
that way merely for the fun of
keeping him for some years. Roberts
was then released, whereupon the
Salv’army took him in hand, sent
him to its Gippsland home and
wrestled earnestly with him in
prayer. The bout was so strenuous
that the officers presently got the
escapee down, and in his contrition
he decided that it was his duty to go
back to gaol in S. Aus. So a special
officer was detailed to take him over,
and hand him back to the people
who don’t want him and yet can’t
see very well how they can refuse him.
“F.C.”: Having just inspected Mel-
bourne’s big Agricultural Show 1 have privately
formed the opinion that it should be re-named the
Royal Mechanical Show, and the horse, the cow
and other evidences of primary industries should
be put in their proper places as side-lines. The
manufacturer and the mechanic annually produce
something new and worth seeing, often worth
having. They do not toil on the lines of their
fathers. But the farmer progresses not at all.
His horses are much the same kind of beast that
Jehu urged along when he called on Jezebel
at Jezreel; his cow is mostly the same two-
horned, four-legged goddess whose progenv the
Israelites worshipped; his ox is no different
from the one that wasn’t to be muzzled when he
trod out the corn. If the farmer had any sense
of the fitness of things, and tried to dimly realise
what is expected of him, he would set him-
self to produce more efficacious quadrupeds. A
combined cow-horse, for instance—one that would
yield 30 or 40 gallons of milk per day while
trotting eight hours behind a sulky—would be a
valuable invention ; while a combined pig-hen
that would lay a dozen eggs daily for three years
and then cut up into prime bacon, would render
life a boon to many. But the farmer just toddles
along in the same old rut, while he calls himself
the backbone of the country, and wonders what
we should do without him.
Two persons afflicted with the cantan-
kerous habit, which is a disease among State In-
sects, happened into Fitzroy (Vic.) court lately.
They got . married away back in 1!)00, but
separated after six months’ wedded bliss; and
thereafter, though they dwelt near each other,
and frequently passed in the street, neither recog-
nised the other’s existence. The trouble origin-
ally arose from the absence of a button from
the husband’s start. The wife desired him to
temporarily replace it with a pin. The average
woman uses a pin to repair anything, from a torn
gossamer to a damaged reputation, and she can’t
understand that the average man simply loathes
pins. He will fasten up his extraneous forked
circumstances with a nail or a splinter or a bit of
string, but he has no use for pins, whereas she
couldn’t exist without them. For lack of ability
to grasp that fact, these two have gone on their
lonesome for nine years. Being in poor health
the lady got an order for 15s. a week—pin money.

Dr. Elkington, Barmnaland’s Health Com-
missioner, who was in North Queensland recently,
is quite satisfied that the white mail can live up
North. He says :
I saw no evidence of race deterioration whatever among
the people of the North. On the contrary, indeed, I believe
their physical quality and their energy is, if anything,
superior to that of the people elsewhere. I met many
people from the South, including Tasmania, who have
settled in the North, and there is no trace of anything to
Warrant a suggestion of deterioration among them. I had
opportunities, too, of observing people born in the North,
and neither in them nor their families is there a trace of
degeneracy. The infant mortality in the North is ex-
ceedingly low, and that is, perhaps, the best of all tests
of climatic conditions.

Can sally forth, to-day,
A drab old “ bowler ” on his head,
With none to say him nay
Or chide him for his deshabille
In any sort of way.
The Panama-enthusiast
May gratify his whim
For wearing head-gear that is vast
And flapsome, as to brim.
His countrymen will not project

He even may proceed to back
His fancy in a cap—
A deed that, erstwhile, would have caused

A solitary rap.

The Law of Victoria has just discovered
that it is a shingle short, in a manner of speak-
ing, in a question concerning motor-cars. The
man who removes another person’s horse from a
stable and uses it will presently find himself in
considerable trouble, even though he return the
prad undamaged ; but when this law was made
motors hadn’t been invented, and since they have
arrived the Law has been too busy or too tired to
devise the necessary enactment. Wherefore a
cheerful Bendigo youth, who “ borrowed ” a motor
from the garage where he toiled, drove it and
some friends to Melbourne, capsized a tramcar,
had a gaudy time generally, and then drove the
weapon back again, has had the satisfaction of
learning that the Law can’t do anything to him
because *i»ere is no Act, statute, regulation or by-
law in such case made and provided. Now
Premier Weary and Attorney-General Drysdale
Brown are in a violent hurry to pass legislation
to meet such cases, wherefore this paper would
urge them to go slow. This is eminently a case
where hasty legislation should be avoided, and
where time should be allowed for consideration
and review, lest the marriage tie be slackened
and capital driven from the country.

Manly (N.S.W.) is seething with annoy-
ance in connection with a matter of Art. The
Mayor (Aid. Bonner), in taking over
Fairlight, old W. C. Woods’s house
(Woods made a sizeable pile in the
sanitary business in the dark old
typhoid days when Manly was even
less adequately sewered than it is to-
day), found himself in possession of
half a dozen statues. They repre-
sented the four seasons, Captain /
Cook and Nelson, and they
glinted dreadfully in the old
man’s harbor-side garden for
years. Woods deemed them
passing fair, and so did Bon-
ner. The hyper-critic, how-
ever, was wont to gaze on them
in stupefy f ion, and then shudder
and say, “ . lorrible ! ” The other
day the Mayor, aided and abetted
by the town Council, presented
the horrors to Manly free gratis,
and fixed sites for them along the
Corso and on the Ocean Beach.
The thing was done with appalling
swiftness, but soon the inhabitants
realised what had befallen their
native town, and straightway
they emitted one wild collec-
tive curse, and the Council
buildings shook to their foun-
dations. At latest advices a
League was said to be in course
of formation, pledged, if the
chiselled-iniquities are exposed in
the public streets, to assassinate
the Mayor and arrange to have his
remains refused Christian burial.
It would be all to the good if
drastic action of some sort were
taken in the case of all mayors
who present statues, pictures,
ornamental drinking fountains
and so on to defenceless muni-
cipalities. A buried mayor is,
generally, a far more gracious,
pleasing circumstance than an
unburied statue of the sort he
affects.
A wretched Christian Science person, of
Sydney, who let his young son die for want of
medical treatment because he believed in healing
by faith and prayer, has been sent to prison for
three months. At the end of that period he is to
undertake to be of good behavior —which pre-
sumably means that he is to swear off the active
practice of Christian Science—for three years, or
else do another half-year in gaol. The boy who
died had only one leg, but his father believed
that devotion and pious observances would make
the missing extremity grow again. Certain mad-
dened or utterly wicked members of the sect to
which he belonged “told him they had heard of li nibs
growing again,” and he was waiting for the miracle
to happen when diphtheria carried the victim
off. It isn’t very easy to regret the child’s death,
for there is very little prospect ahead of a maimed
boy who is liable to inherit the intellect of such a
parent. As for the old man, his sentence is an
absurdity. What is required in such a case is
permanent confinement in an asylum, the con-
finee to be at perfect liberty to get out by prayer
and faith,-if he can manage it; but to be recap-
tured if he escapes by means of a ladder or other
mundane device. And there should be a stringent
law against the marriage Of persons who believe
in allowing their children to die neglected and
unattended; in fact, lunatics (including Christian
Scientists), congenital dwarfs, persons with cer-
tain diseases, dipsomaniacs and habitual criminals
should be regarded by the law as unfit to repro-
duce their species. As for the gang which fed
this particular crank with stories about how lost
limbs were restored by prayer, it seems to be
beyond the reach of the law as at present consti-
tuted.
A notable figure in the case is Gibbs, apparently
a sort of “Christian Science doctor.” According
to the father’s evidence, he first advised that a
doctor should be called in, and then opposed the
administration of the doctor’s remedies. He
prayed strenuously and officially in the case, and
seems to have been the head and front of the
offence while the silly father was only the tail.
It seems a great pity that the law can’t find some
way of taking powerful cognisance of Gibbs.

Looking over a recent London Times
report of “the World Missionary Conference,”
the writer came across this casual utterance by a
prelate of the Church of England
The Bishop of Southwark said the Conference owed its
success to its inter-denominationalism. His own Com-
munion, standing between the Homan Catholic and Pro-
testant worlds, understood them better than they under-
stood each other. They must recognise the Roman and
Eastern Communions.
It is curious that so much stress should be laid on
the necessity for the King to swear that he is a
solid, unflinching Protestant of the Anglican
tabernacle, when that shandygaff denomination
takes so many opportunities to explain that it
isn’t Protestant at all.

Wireless is reported to have found a new
and exciting job for the old gunboat Torch,
which, for a long time past, has been dozing com-
fortably by Garden Island in Sydney Harbor.
Up in the Persian Gulf, where the industry of
gun-running flourishes exceedingly, there is always
something doing ; it is a dull day there when a red-
hot, grey water-policeman isn’t chasing after a fleet-
footed dhow and calling on it to stop in the
King’s name. A report is now swimming round
that the Admiralty reckons it will be able to save
steam and sleep by keeping a wireless receiving
ship on the job, and that the old Torch, which is
now at Cockatoo Island, has been selected from
the Naval old-age pensioners for the job, and is
being overhauled and fitted with the apparatus
in readiness for a crew which will arrive in the
Gibraltar. So, unless Rumor is the usual liar,
the little vessel which used merely to collect bar-
nacles in its sleep, will soon be assisting Captains
Kettle and Brassbound towards insolvency.

The Wellington (M.L.) Times has started
another “grand voting contest.” The winner of
the contest will be given a trip round the world,
and other valuable prizes are announced. In its
issue of August 18 the Times says :
A local young lady of distinguished, appearance has
adopted a novel and effective method of securing votes
for her favorite candidate. She lends her company to
young gentlemen for morning tea for one month’s sub-
scription to the Timks ; for luncheon, three months’ sub-
scription ; afternoon tea, two months’ subscription ; and
for week-end picnics, to the highest subscription bidder.
Why not define her rather as a young lady of
distinguished cheek? Consider the vastness of
her hide and how it would go twice round an
elephant and then leave a remnant trailing on
the ground. You take this person out. You pay
her tram fare, train fare, boat fare, cab fare, or
whatever it is. You buy her food and drink and
confectionery, and pay for them also. And then
she expects you to pay her for coming out and
being paid for. The only remedy for a case like
that is six months of rigid boycott—six months of
lonesome afternoon tea and solitary friendless
back seats at the theatre, all at her own expense ;
mid of weary mud-trudgings when she finds her-
self accidentally minus a train-fare. Then she
could charge herself any rate she liked for the
pleasure of her own company and it would be all
m the family so to speak.
By “ Free Lance ” :
The inquest on the body of Ivy O’Brien, the pill who
was found dead in a sandy by-way of Kensington
(Sydney), was expected to be nfildly sensational, but it
proved to be an outsize in drama. It was known that tiie
police suspected the girl’s mother of knowing more than
they did. Still, at the inquest the mother told her story
in a very straightforward manner, and the stepfather
was particularly clear. When the mother was asked if
she knew the accused woman, Nurse Brown, who was in
court with her son, her eyes wandered round the pit mists
till they rested on the pair. Mrs. Brown leaned forward, as
though inviting scrutiny, and so did the son. The
mother stared at them for fully a minute, and they
stared back just as hard. It looked like a hypnotic ex-
periment or a test of will power. At last the witness
declared she had never seen either of them, before.
Then entered the witness, described in the press as the
“veiled woman.” She was a homely and‘ tremulous
body, and amidst sobs she told how she had seen the
mother of the dead girl call at Nurse Brown’s home on
the Monday afternoon; how she had admitted Ivy
O’Brien herself on Tuesday morning, apparently well;
and half an hour later had seen her insensible and helped
to carry her downstairs ; and how, at Nurse Brown’s re-
quest, she had gone to the girl’s home with a message
bidding her mother to come immediately. Also, she told
how she had met Nurse Brown at Victoria Bark races
and learned that the girl had died, and that her body
had been left out on the sandhills. She alleged that the
nurse said it was kinder than throwing her over the cliffs,
as the parents wished to do. After all of which, she said,
the nurse gave her 10s. to put on a horse. That tale
closed the day’s proceedings, and an exasperated public
settled down to wait for a whole w'eek for the next instal-
ment of a story that will supply Judkins with fighting
material for the next two years.
A name which cropped up during the proceedings
indirectly recalled a fairly recent story. In this
business, as in others, brainy count. One Sydney
doctor was (perhaps he still is) known to have a
remarkable drug mixture which obviated any
necessity for a surgical operation. Some other men
in the illegal profession determined to get it,
and hired a patient- to attend his hospital.
She was not to swallow the drug, which was given in a
sort of capsule, but to collect a, sample and then
leave. The girl was admitted and presently things began
to go wrong. She had hoped, by a sudden leap for the
front door of the premises, to get away with a specimen
of the precious medicine, and as she was a big girl
and lengthy of limb, she seemed to have a chance.
As it proved, she had none. She was put to tied, and
her clothes removed from the room, and then the doctor
himself gave her the first dose of medicine. She tried
hard not to swallow, for she still hoped to get away with
it. The doctor kept his eye on her throat, for signs of
anything going down. Then he asked her angry, sus-
picious questions. Next he prised her mouth, open and
found her trying to hide the capsule behind a tooth.
The medicine was confiscated and burned; the patient
was dragged out of bed and dressed under the supervision
of two nurses, every article of clothing being carefully
inspected ; and then the Girl That Failed was shot out of
the front gate, and told to tell her employers that their
next emissary would be poisoned.

For of everything it’s afraid.
So horribly scared has this party grown
That in gloomy places it lurks ;
By some new name is the old thing known ;
The label is honestly not its own,
But behind it it plots and shirks.
Now completely covered from head to heels
In its woefully thin disguise,
Again in public it loudly squeals
And uplifts its brolly in wild appeals,
As it trots out the same old lies.
But if you once whisper its ancient name
It will leap in the air and yell;
For its platform ways are still the same,
And its notions are just as blind and lame,
And its smell is the same old smell.

MANNERS!
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Dr. L. D. Bevan, now of Adelaide, lately of Collins-
street, Melbourne, is still anxious to have Australia
cultivate “ friendly relations ” with the Chow and the
Jap. Much may be done by kindness, he thinks ; and,
above all, he advises politeness and courtesy. “When I
read contemptuous references to our nearest neighbors,”
lie says, “ I tremble for the future. We should keep
respectful tongues and cultivate a courteous demeanor.”
Austral-i-ans, your duty’s plain :
Begin politer methods now,
Don’t talk of “ Monkey men ” again
And pull your forelock to the Chow.
Believe me, friends, when all is said,
True courtesy’s the better plan—
So bow with reverence your head :
Say “ Mister Fat 1 ”
And doff your hat
When talking to the laundryman.
For Bevan shudders at each scrap
Of scornful print, and groans to see
Those vulgar pictures of the Jap
The Bulletin prints constant-fee.
Let’s set a good example—such
That when at length the Japanese
Come south they may not grab or clutch,
But take the land
With gentle hand,
And saying nicely “ If you please.”

The Hack”: “Janor,” while endorsing my
remarks regarding- the quality of the Vic. Preserving
Co.’s tinned fish., accuses me of blaming Australians
unjustly for not supporting the local fish-canner ; and
alleges that the importer is the person really deserving
my censure (B. 11/8/’10). In support of his contention,
he states that many storekeepers are bound hand and
foot to the importers, and cannot stock what they
please. In some instances this is no doubt true, but
such cases are exceptional; and from long experience as
a retail shopkeeper I still affirm that the Australian
public, taken by and large, is most to blame in the
matter. There are thousands of shopkeepers throughout
Australia quite willing to stock the local article, if for no
other reason than that it yields a larger profit than the
imported “ lines” ; but the public either won’t buy it, or
buys so gradually that the stuff is a dead investment.
A traveller for the V.P.0., who is a good Australian, re-
cently assured me that many grocers were willing to
push, and had tried to push, the local sea-resident after
he is tinned, but the demand for the imported gentleman
in the metal overcoat Was as hard to break down as the
•demand for imported whisky, and while retail sellers
bought the foreign fish in five or ten case lots they would,
in many cases, take only three tins at a time of the good
Australian article. I’m not unjust to the Australian
consumer ; but the Australian consumer is durned unjust
to Australia.

The report which the directors made to the
•annual meeting of shareholders in the Melbourne
Tram Go. was a masterpiece of snuffle. After dilating on
the little they have done for the public and the much
they have done for themselves, the bosses congratulated
the shareholders on the establishment of the P’ran-
Malvern electric tram line, as it relieved them of the
necessity to keep a lot of unprofitable ’buses and horses.
“The directors have no desire to maintain horse traction,
and would be glad if any effective way could be found to
work the horse lines by mechanical power.” Yet, the
other day, Hawthorn Council offered to take over the
local horse line, with a view to electrification, and pro-
posed to pay its share of the sinking fund, amounting to
£1950 ; whereupon, though the line admittedly i 9 a losing
proposition, the Tramway directors coolly demanded
compensation for their running rights. In other words,
the co. is so fond of electrification that it prefers to go on
'losing money for six years more rather than give admit-
tance to the thing it says it loves.

Dad used to go out with his two old mokes and
his single-furrow plough and prod up an acre or so of
Australia in a long, laborious day. The three-furrow
plough then arrived and was the limit for years ; and
•Dad had an idea that it was a monstrosity which couldn’t
■be expected to do decent work. Now the three-furrow
plough is a plaything and a Kadina (S. Aus.) implement
shop has just turned out a tool that roots up 21 furrows
simultaneously. It’s a good job for his peace of mind

Another of Tait’s remarkable trains has com-
mitted a dashing act in the Weary State. The other day
16 trucks sneaked out of the station at Elaine and bolted
-for Geelong. In all they covered 25 miles of rail before
they were halted suddenly at Gheringhap. At this
station they were switched into a nice, secluded dead-
end, and finished their jaunt with a crash. Pour or five
damaged trucks now bear witness to the pace of a train
assisted by a precipitous gradient. The grade is one of
-the most perilous in the State, for between Meredith and
Lethbridge the line drops 579 ft. in 9J miles.
“ Seebee ” : The use of the oil-engine on wind-
jammers spreads apace. The coastal ketch plying into
this port (Adelaide), if not fitted with an auxiliary pro-
peller, usually has a winch chug-chugging away on deck
and snatching the cargo out of the miniature hold.
Struck rather a novelty the other day on the ketch Sea
Plower. The boat came across the Gulf with a load of fire-
wood, and had a circular saw in full blast on its deck,
hitched on to an oil-engine, while a friction winch lifted the
•foot-length fuel up to the waiting drays on the wharf. This
portable wood-yard i%ea suggests countless possibilities.
John Darling will probably put a flour-mill oh to his
wheat ships next.

“Muscat”: Here, at Leonora (W.A.), and
within a radius of three miles, there is a population of
over 3000, including many Dagoes who dig in the earth
and “chop-a da vood ”in the mulga. It is their delight
to look upon wine when it is red. Yet no Australian
wine license has been allowed, the last application being
refused because herds of publicans lined up to say they
could supply the missing liquid. Subsequent investiga-
tion, however, shows that several do not stock it; others
don’t even know the price per bottle or gallon, while one
offered S.A. port at 4s. 6d. per bottle, though the fair
retail price is Is. Surely something is wrong.

The old story ! An Australian tells how, when
wandering down Market-street in San Francisco (U.S.A.),
he sudderdy found himself confronted by a vast gilded
sign which intimated that the whole of the clothing
turned out by that emporium was made from “pure
Australian woollens—the best tweed on earth.” Here,
he thought, was a patriotic Australian holding the
national fame high in the most patriotic country on
earth. He ambled inside for a chat. Yes, the proprietor
was on tap. Would the stranger come right in? He
eame right in and found himself face to face with a pure-
blooded Yank of about the seventh generation, who was
real glad to see an Australian. He explained that he had
never been in Australia, but had come across a sample of
its woollen cloth by accident. He saw there was a for-
tune in it, and he was making that fortune almighty quick
right now. The dazed Australian staggered out to the
nearest drug store for a reviver, and on com-
ing out he got another "shock. It was in the
3hape of a gorgeous announcement to the effect
that the firm in the front down-tairs office was prepared
to start people on the land growing the Australian
eucalyptus, by which a competence could be amassed in
a few years on a comparatively small plot. The firm
supplied the land on time-payment, also the young trees,
and it undertook to find a market for the products.
That sort of thing is rare in Australia. Recently the
writer was up in Cairns (North Queensland), and in the
main street he found the tailoring establishment of a
practical patriot named Hillman, who displayed a large
notice to the effect that—
Tuts Window Contains
Only
Australian-Made Goods.
And he has met the same thing in Adelaide and Mel-
bourne. But in Sydney, the capital of the great wool
State of the Commonwealth, you see it so rarely that
when you do see it you stare. Sydney has got the im-
porting disease, and hides its manufactures with shame
in a dark corner.

FIRST SHEARER: “Look ’ere, Stumpy, you’ve
blanky well GOT to shout! I've bin shoutin'
ever since we cut out."
SECOND DITTO : “I’d shout, square
an’ all, Bill, hut I’ve got a
tore throat.”
“Geofred ” : Did any of the people who
write about Angoragoats ever see one shorn? Idid.
I was out Geraldton (Q.) way one shearing season,
and a chap that I knew to be among the best and
fastest sheep-shearers in Australia invited me to
watch him and some mates “go through ” a shed
of Angoras. The shed was fitted somewhat the
same as an ordinary shearing-shed, exceptingthat
the pens were higher and built of stouter material
than in an ordinary shed. They had need to be.
My shearing friend went into a pen to grab a
goat, and for the next ten minutes the fight raged
as if a menagerie were on fire. Eventually a
stinker was captured, and all went well until the
“ long blow ” from shoulder to hindquarters was
reached. Then that Angora broke loose, and
goat, goat-perfume and goat-shearer were mixed
in a wiiirl of fury. The boss’s swearing awoke the
seven sleepers and the night-watchman of Hades,
the stink withered the vegetation in the vicinity,
and I didn’t stop running till I reached a pub 2J
miles away. I wouldn’t shear an Angora for
half shares in a brewery, and a man can’t say
more than that.
THE REWARD OF DILIGENCE.
COCKY FARMER (to his sons): “If yous young uns alius docs what I tells yer, and alius has
the cows milked by five o’clock in the mornin', I’ll let yers go to the ploughin' match

“ Quidnunc ” : When Hone came down to
Wellington (M.L.) recently, he caught the roller-
skating mania. Now, Hone turns the beam at
17st., and when somebody bumped him on the
hard rink the thud was like a dead elephant fall-
ing from Heaven. Hone didn’t like it, and when
two minutes later the performance was repeated,
the blood of his fighting ancestors began to whirl..
He was just rising from the second bounce when
three skaters collided and fell upon him in a heap.
With a wild yell Hone tore his skates off, and
started in to brain the fallen like Te Wherowhero,
when he sat on the ground and, one by one,
smashed the skulls of upwards of 250 Ngatiawa
prisoners with his greenstone mere. But Hone
was grabbed by the attendants before he could do
much damage, and 17 men dragged him from the
floor and propped him out into the night. When
I came out he had just finished wiping the ruins
of his countenance. “No plurry more te skate,”
said Hone ; “ I play you hundred up.”

“Geofred”: Apropos the lie of “Pick”
(B. 11/8/TO) re long-distance swimming by dry-
land animals. “Pick’s” contention may be all
right, and bis records may likewise stand till
the sunset of Judgment Day; but for
a long-distance swim that served some
practical use, commend me to the
young porker that saved the lives
of voyagers per s.s. Kameruka
when that boat foundered off
the South Coast (N.S.W.)
about 10 years ago. A very
rough sea was running, and
no hopes were held out of,
being able to get a rope ashore
till a genius suggested throw-
ing a bacon over hoard, with a
rope attached. Pig was accord-
ingly chucked in. But hope
seemed doomed to die of a broken
heart, for pig hovered round for at
least five minutes before making off; for
the shore. Once he was fairly under way,
however, he made a merry pace and soon reached
the land with his life-line. This pig was a prac-
tical life-saver—not a mere inflated animal that
wanted to show off his ability.
* * * *
“ Wyndy Ryder”: The sea north of
Broome (W. A.), where the pearling boats are
thickest, is swarming with turtles. The black,
brindle and yellow crews of the luggers go
ashore in the laying season, chiefly on the
Lacepede Islands, searching for turtle eggs.
The poor old turtle flounders ashore to deposit
her eggs in the sand ; and as Mrs. Turtle is prac-
tically helpless on land she is easily captured by
the Yellow Agony, who does not wait for nature
to perform its task, but slashes open the poor
brute’s flank and extracts the eggs. Then the
human brute departs and leaves the other one to
die in agony under the heat of the tropical sun.
A turtle left under these circumstances lingers
for days, and it is a species of fiendish and dia-
bolical cruelty of which only an Asiatic would be
guilty. Footscray on a muggy day is not to be
compared to the Laeepedes after a foray by these
savages. The Westralian Government is alleged
to be aware of this practice ; but still it continues.
“Ifcan” : The first dairy on the North
Cowst (N.S.W.) was established by one Glennie,
probably a relation of the family after whom
Glennie’s Creek, Singleton, was named, right
away under the shadow of Mount Lindsay, This
was well-nigh half a century ago. There were
then no roads north of the convict-made ways
about Port Macquarie, excepting bridle-paths
and the tracks the bullock teams made as
they plodded through the bush. Most of
the Cowst was then standing scrub, and
practically impenetrable. Glennie, on the hunt
for broad acres, worked down from Warwick
across the Macpherson Range, and struck a fine
piece of plain country near Lindsay. At that
time the Tooloon and other local finds of alluvial
were attracting thousands of people, and Glennie
conceived the plan of supplying butter to the
miners. The product of 200 or 300 cows had to be
conveyed per packhorse across very rough coun-
try ; but he did it regularly, and made a solid
wad of money before the diggings fizzled, when
he packed the grease to Warwick. In those
slower and less fastidious days there were no
separators, nor any of the other modern appli-
ances, and butter a few days old would either run
away from its owner or sit up and use language
that, nowadays, would bring the Health Depart-
ment out to read the Riot Act.

WHEN ROSES BLOOM AGAIN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
There's a year-time—’tis a dear time, when the eartli is
newly waking - ,
And the wattle, crowned with blossom, sends her in-
cense very far ;
’Tis the time of growth and gladness when the buds are
freshly breaking,
And the earth’s a censer swinging past each perfume-
laden star!
When the magpies in the tree-tops lift their chorded
morning carol,
And the tender leaves are bending ’neath the glistening
drops of rain ;
Then I know that Spring draws nearer, and I see her fair
apparel
When the land to me is calling, and the roses bloom
again !
There’s a splendor, fair and tender, when the rose from
sleep is stirring, -
And the honey-birds are swinging in the blossom-
burdened trees;
There’s a gladness and a soul-lift when a million wings
are whirring,
And the kookaburra’s laughter rings with choral har-
monies !
When the hill-tops loom in grandeur through the mists
and sweeping showers,
Then I hear a chanted anthem and a lilting, glad
refrain;
And ’tis good to hold dominion o’er a realm of trees and
flowers
When the skies are azure-curtained and the roses bloom
again !
There’s a glory when the lory with his scarlet sheen is
flashing—
Wings that gleam amid the frondage as he takes his
bushward way ;
And a t housand tree-top voices in a stream of song are
plashing—
Better far to hear their music than to wear a king’s
array;
Who shall sigh for mad dominion over men and over
nations?
In the empire of my garden let me rule and have my
fane;
Here is peace and here is joyaunce—sceptred kings seem
imitations,
When the world is sheened with splendor and the roses
bloom again 1
I There’* a Year-Time—’tis a cheer-time when the clouds
go drifting over,
And the sapphire days come shining in a Land where
I would stay:
Comes the Spring with all her perfume—and I am her
ardent lover,
And I find my True Republic where the blossomed tree-
tops sway !
Give me here my fair dominion where the flowers are
lightward steering.
Sailing forth from lands I know not through the
laughing xoinds and rain ;
Let me here be Chief and Ruler—kings may have their
pomp and cheering,
When the wattle-birds are calling and My Roses Bloom
Again !

Yes. But why not for women? When will
invention do as much for women in the home as it
has done for men in the workshop? Once more do
patent agents Phillips Ormonde & Co. (whose-
offices are approached by the Arcade lift 266

little progress made in household labour saving
machinery. Why is it that the housewife works-
as long hours to-day as ever? Why has not in-
vention increased her leisure for recreation andi

“ Puketapu ” : I never knew him to be
called any other name than “Old Jqb, ,Hynm
Book.” Met him years back when I was working
a beach claim on the West Coast of Maoriland,
and it was from his store and grog shinty in the
small settlement that we got our supplies of
tucker and liquor. He made it a boast that he
was a very religious man, and I believe he was,
although he did not allow that to ruin his busi-
ness, or even to wear the edge off it. When he v
advised one or other or all of us not to drink
(which he did at all possible opportunities), he
did it in such a way that if there was one
thing in the world you craved for more than
another it was strong liquor. “You,” he said
to me once,” you ain’t strong enough to stand
drink. If you make more than tucker out of
your claim you ought to put it into land. Is it
not written that the righteous shall inherit the
earth? Well, how can y’ be righteous if yer a
drunken swab? It ain’t possible.” But it was
his manner of making up an account that used to
amuse me—even after a solid week’s jag. The
following is a fair example :

MISPLACED SYMPATHY.
TOURIST (to farmer who has put in a lot of graft
in his time ringharking and clearing timber):
“ Yes, hut it's terribly hard luck, old chap,
that all your trees hare died. Quite spoils
the look of the place, you know."
THE SORT OF JEST THAT
LEADS TO BITTERNESS.
1ST SUBURBANITE: "Steal! Then'll steal anything. Last week the wife went out for an hour,
and a man came in and shook all the lead off the roof."
2ND DITTO : “ That's nothing. My wife never left the house for a minute yesterday, and a
man came in and shook all the carpets."
“Cict”: I encountered a strange old
billiard table t’other week-end, at a far-out pub-
bery. It stood over against the beer-pump, under
the shadow of the legend: “Billiards Free—so
up,” and was in constant use. After a while I
got a game, and then found that the slates of the
contrivance had been so rasped, planed or other-
wise whittled away in the region of the pockets
thftt, should a ball meander within a foot of
any of them, it sped in for a certainty.
The proprietor explained to me that the planing
had been done for game-shortening purposes.
“It’s a drink table,” he said. “Of course, I
ain’t serposed ter know they plays fer drinks;
but they do all ther same.” Queried as to how
he exacted the purchase of liquor from the players,
he informed me that, should any pair commence
the second 50 without the customary “shout,” he
always demanded the balls under the plea that he
was about to brush and dust the table.

“ Dandaloup ” writes :
Could any scientific reader tell me why, when a diver
is paralysed by falling into a crevice or suddenly going
down into very deep water, it is on the turn of the tide
following the accident that the man either dies or recovers?
Two divers recently at Broome (W. A.) fell into a hole 36
fathoms deep, and on being hauled on board, died a,t the
turn of the tide. The strange thing about the whole
proceeding is: if they happen to get paralysed on one
tide it is on the turn of the next that they either come to
or take the plunge into eternity.
The Bulletin’s theory is simply that the
thing doesn’t happen. It is quite prepared
to admit that “ Dandaloup’s ” two divers
died at the turn of the tide, but if they
were going to die they had to die some time,
and their case isn’t necessarily a precedent.
There used to be much discussion as to
why a wounded snake never died till sunset,
but at last it was discovered that a wounded
snake died just when it felt that way, and
the controversy ended there. The question
why ghosts only walked at night got a rest
when people concluded that ghosts never
walked at all. And then there was the great
public worry about the vampire-girl. The
vampire was dead and lay in her coffin float-
ing in blood, but at the same time she
walked about in human guise, generally
weariug the shape of a beautiful woman, and
frequented society, and danced at vice-regal
and other balls, and in between times
sucked the blood of her victims. The only
way to get rid of her was to'open her grave
and drive a stake right through her, where-
upon: she gave a fearsome howl and .ceased
to vamp. There was much discussion in
the Aboriginalities column of the Middle
Ages as to why vampires could only be killed
this way. Then it was discovered that
there had never been any vampires, and
editors ceased to pay for contributions con-
cerning them. And the wehr-wolf controversy
ended,the same way,

“Tiger Sijake,” from the remotest Nor’-
West
Re “ Vigilans ” and buffalo (B. 2/6/’10). There certainly
is much room for enterprise in the Territory section of
Australia. Also much room for improvement in the cal-
culating capacities of johnnies like “Vigilans.” For
instance, by what mathematical process does “ Vigilans ”
figure Paddy Cahill to have slaughtered 1605 (mind the
five) beasts in one month of, at most, 31 days when his
highest tally was 48 for one day? Likewise, Martin must
have had some difficulty in capturing 1100 in one month
with a highest total of 36 for one day. Who was it cap-
tured “Vigilans” and emptied such figures into him?
“Vigilans”: So at last a co. has been
formed to systematically strip the black man-'
grove of the North Queensland coast for its valu-
able tanning bark. Whatever the demand 1 may
be, the supply won't bother
the co. The Queensland coast
hasn’t a monopoly; in fact,
the largest mangrove forests I
have seen in Australia are on
the north-west coast. From
Broome to Derby is one long
stretch of inlets and mangrove
swamps. For hundreds of
miles nothing is to be seen but
mangroves, growing in an
impenetrable thicket. It is
the only vegetable growth
which can gain a footing in
the world of salt water. In
fact, it makes its own foot-
ing, entangling and holding
mud and ddbris about its
stems, and ever blindly reach-
ing out dangling roots. A
mangrove seed will germinate
before it falls. Assuming the
appearance of a loaded club,
from Bin. to 15in. in length, it
drops like a plummet into the
soft mud, where it sticks up-
right. Or, again, aerial rodts
are thrown out from branches
high in air. Swinging down-
ward and outward, these roots
clutch at the mud beneath.
Where the current runs swiftly
they swing and dangle in
vain, until they have grown
so heavy that they touch bot-
tom some distance down
stream. Throughout all this
region there is not a foot of
solid ground, so the wild
creatures of the mangrove
. must either swim, climb or
, fly. More wonderful even
than the coral polyps are these
mangroves, for by this plant
alone large coastal areas have
been rescued from the sea. In
• years, as the mudbanks become
higher, and are fertilised by
the falling leaves, other
growths appear, and finally the coast is pushed
out yards and miles.

“De Yid ” : Ever noticed the fondness of
our “colored brudder ” for walking-sticks?
Truly, when he is dressed as Solomon in all his
Canaanitish clobbery of paste and dirt and rain-
bow ties, he is a meek and gentle person to be
“saved” and encouraged. Out of a of
frantic Singhs some time back, the Adelaide
police snatched some pleasant little mementos,
chief among them being a steel bed-rail which had
served as walking-stick to one of the tribe. But
- the Indian generally affects a light, pliable cane,
which he can spring and twist with wonderful
dexterity, or else a thin steel rod with curved
handle, painted black to represent ebony. The
Afghan isn’t so light of touch as his smaller
brother (whom, by the way, he regards with a
mighty contempt), and he favors the more aggress-
ive thick stick with a gold or silver top, heavily
loaded, As for the wliitey-brown Syrian,
he isn’t particular; but for weird con-
trivances he annexes the prize-list. Old-
fashioned, heavy sticks, that are really clever
sword-scabbards, and lighter ones whereof the
top pulls off and turns itself into a very business-
like dagger, often accompany him on his peaceful
walks. As a matter of fact, half the “colored”
rows are hushed up, being mainly tribal or family
feuds imported here, and thriving with a double
strength in our friendly climate ; and the sticks
are needed oftener than the newspaper-reading
public has any idea of.
“ The Prodigal ” : A new shearing record
has been put up at Cambridge Downs (North
Queensland). The shearing lasted four weeks-
and two days, when 117,000 sheep were put-
through by 38 shearers. One day, in ewes and
lambs, the 38 men cut the extraordinary average of
sheep per man. The names of some of them de-
serve to be recorded : Hamson, 265; Garvey, 259 ;.
Hookway, 250 ; Boyland, 246 ; Seary, 244 ; while-
several others were over the 220 mark. The above
will take a lot of beating, and the average for the-
number of men must stand about a world s
record. The more I see of the degenerate Aus-
tralian the more I disagree with Foster Fraser.
In fact, I am emboldened to say that he was not
quite accurate (I put it that way for the sake of
brevity).
* * * *
“Pick”: To me the most unconvincing-
reason for belief in the lyre-bird’s alleged ability
to mimic bush sounds is the fact that, wherever
heard, his so-called imitative cries are exactly
alike, though, in every locality frequented by him,
the bush naturalist will insist that he has acquired
his notes by listening to some local noise. The-
“ clonk-clonk ” emitted from the throat of every
lyre, for instance, is generally claimed to be an
imitation of the sound made by a splitter’s maul
on the wedges, but I have also heard it explained
as the stroke of a piston rod, the clank of a-
bullock chain, the sound of oars in the rowlocks,
and the stampers in a battery. Then, again, the-
“ whir-r-r-r ” that all lyre roosters introduce some-
where in their discourse has variously been
accounted for as the imitation of a saw cut-
ting through a log, the brake grinding on a-
jinker wheel, and the rasp of a corn cracker;
also, quite recently, some bushmen of my acquaint-
ance discovered that it had been learned from the-
buzz of the motor-car. The snap and swish, with
which the bird catches his breath after an un-
usual burst of eloquence, is, in different localities,,
said to be the lash of a whip, the snapping of a
branch, the splash of a waterfall, the exhaust-
pipe of an engine, and eleven or fifty thousand'
other things. The dead finish, however, I heard
from a roadman on the Tantawanglo Mountain,
who declared that the racket proceeding from a
fern-clothed valley below was thelyre-bird mocking
a bullock-driver’s heated address to his team when:
ascending the Long Pinch. I shook hands sadly
with him and turned back.

“ Gil ” : In the name of Romance I want>
to, utter a vociferous protest against the habit the-
Sunset Land coachdri vers have of blowing a bugle
as they drive into the sleepy western towns.
Twenty years ago—or even less—the bugle blast
was in' keeping with the spirit of th'e times—
when the Level Lands were new ; when the
SHICK!
coaches were up-to-date and properly equipped
when the outlawish horses were fat and glossy
and highly-bred ; and when the driver himself
was a wild haphazard fellow named Hell-Fire-
Jack, who had a sweetheart in every town,_ and
sometimes at every “ change”—not to mention a
large assortment of hair-raising tales of flood and
famine, and skirmishes with blacks and bush-
rangers. He looked his part, every inch of hisv
six feet of sinew and tan and freckles. But now
the telegraph and telephone wires are everywhere,
and the coach-carried news is as stale as last
year’s bread when Coolibah Charlie delivers-
the written screed or the printed word. And,
to make matters worse, the Hog in the motor-
car, and the small Porker on the motor-bike,,
and the mere Guinea Pig on the common bicycle-
flash by him and forestall him at every port of
call. His conveyance, too, is mostly a ram-
shackle affair, his equines wouldn’t inspire the
horse-poet to the extent of the price of a pint of beer,
and the King of the Ribbons generally has a wife-
and kids at home—and prosaic bills to meet at his-
journey’s end. And the sweethearts of his
romantic predecessors are mostly married to
bald-headed men, and those who are single
trying, in the twilight of the years, to adjust the
matrimonial noose on almost anybody. Yet from
Bourke to the Sunset’s Rim the coachdriver blows
his bugle as of old—Busted Romance carolling
the Last Post. I reckon it ought to get six months-

Where pressed the sturdy gums around the humpy on
the rise
Large William, waiting, stood his ground and watched
with wary eyes
The latchfed door. There came loud, bumping noises,
sounds of strife,
Echoes of crash and whirl and bump, cries of “Leggo ! ”
“ Good life ! ’’
And worse than that, to William’s ears alertly pricked,
and then
Of feet that fled—of dreadful tears 1 Large William
knocked again.
The scent of gums, the warm, green smell of bruisfed
clover-crop,
Of grass trod underfoot by well-nigh fourteen stone of
cop;
The hum of wilding bees that sipped the honeyed
blossom-bough.
Bill sensed them all, and moisture dripped a-down his
large, bold brow
As soon the door, flung open, showed a woman standing
there
With eyes in which dull passion glowed, and wildly-worn
back-hair.
One glance he gave at her, and took a deep, long breath
therewith,
And lifted up his voice : “I’m lookin’, ma’am, for Henry
Smith.”
She stood there at the open door, chill hate her eye
within,
And in her strong right hand she bore a fatted rolling-
pin,
Prepared, one would suppose, to strike the stolid man-
in-blue.
“Ho, are yer? Well,” she cried, “ Z’d like t’ see th
blighter, too 1”

The Arowning
of
Methusehlah
NAUGHT, naught is safe! The holiest reputation
/Some critic finds is blurred by fleck and flaw ;
Alert to spy the tiniest aberration
We see.him smirch all records with his paw;
And now comes Noah’s turn. That ancient seaman
Whose only weakness was a taste for gin,
Or some such beverage—some ingenious demon
Contrives to rope him in;
speckled vVooT-Woot'

And prove, no doubt with smug self-satisfaction,
Thttt though he took in all kind, two by two,.
There yet remains a stigma on his action.
On his— who steered a Boat with such a crew—.-
Our Critic will not pry or seek for reason, "
But greets you sudden with a loud *• Ha, ha l
When Noah closed against the wat’ry season—
Where was Methuselah ? ”
From all the figures that the Book Is giving
I gather that upon the fatal day
, The Deluge came, that Ancient still was living-
Nine Sixty Nine the years he’d laughed away,
,j And why he was not down beneath the hatches
\ With all the other creatures, two by two,
' We find no mention in the old despatches—
The Log gives ne’er a clue l
One may surmise—one cannot help surmising
That some old family quarrel lingered yet;
The Grandad, p’raps, was stiff and past advising,
And neither soul could sink it or forget;
And when the Skipper’s trembling old relation
Knocked for admittance in the gathering gloom.
The Boss of all that quaint conglomeration
Replied : “ We’re short of Room 1 ”
We do not say, when on his vessel’s floorway
He’d packed the rhino and the kangaroo.
He yet spurned off the Ancient from the doorway
The while he hugged the zebra and the gnu;
But in that Ark, where each one had a section,
Where Japheth snugly dwelt and Japheth’s ma,
We muchly fear there was no neat erection
Labelled, “ Methuselah 1 ”
“Z)e mortuis,” of course, “ nil nisi bonum
The motto’s really noble in its way ;
But truth is truth. Our sins we’re forced to own ’em,
And so must those who've had their little day.
Wherefore we’ve weighed, with niceness analytic,
The case of Noah squarely up and down,
And do conclude, with yonder carping critic—
“He let his Grandad drown I ”
The Skipper sailed—his fault I am not screening
And made for Ararat o’er waters lone,
What time, perchance, upon some log careening.
The Grandsire met the Deluge “ on his own ” ;
We lean to Noah, grieve to see him branded
With any kind of fault or petty crime;
But yet we can’t forget his hapless Grandad
Cut off before bis time!

THE DROWNING OF METHUSELAH.
A theological controversy has broken out in England. It is pointed out that “Methuselah lived after he begat Lantech 782 years”
(Genesis V., 26). Also, that “Lantech lived 182 years and begat Noah” (Genesis V., 28); and again (Genesis VII., 6), “Noah was 600 years
old when the flood of waters was upon the earth” (600 and 182 = 782). The question is: Did Methuselah die naturally just before the flood
started, or did Noah leave his old grandfather to drown because he was getting past work?

Builds Up
Delicate Children
Dear Sirs, —My little boy has been a constant worry to us through loss
of appetite. We could not get him to eat any kind of food, and he
became as thin as a rail. We tried many different remedies without benefit,
and began to fear he would develop consumption. A iriend advised
Anger’s Emulsion, and it has had a marvellous effect upon my little boy’s
health. To-day he can eat like a farmer, and is well and strong and in
perfect health. I have no hesitation in saying that Angier’s Emulsion is
a splendid remedy for delicate children. (Name and address privately.)
ANGIER’S EMULSION
(PETROLEUM WITH HYPOPHOSPHITES.)
The soothing and strengthening properties of Angier’s Emulsion and its
agreeable, cream-like taste make it the ideal remedy for delicate children.
It makes the little ones eat better, digest better, sleep better, and rapidly
gain in weight,-strength and colour. Doctors prescribe it for coughs and
all lung weakness, scrofula, rickets, malnutrition and all wasting and
bowel disorders. Of Chemists, 1/3, 2/9 and 4/6.

According to solicitor E. H. Tebbutt, in
The Magistrate (Sept. 1)
Next to Premier Wade, the best-hated man in New
South Wales is Inspector Keneh, of the Pure Foods Act.
Tebbutt publishes a justification of Kench, but
Wade is thrown in without explanation or excuse
—unless being the best-hated man in the State is
an excuse. Anyhow, it’s not an explanation, and,
at best, it’s a darned poor excuse.
The crowning glory of the Judkins bur-
lesque in Melbourne is the Judkins bodyguard.
The other evening, at a suburban hall, the body-
guard failed to arrive on time. When it did turn
up, Judkins was already in the building, sucking
a jujube preparatory to launching a new lot of
diatribes against the use of fresh air in parks and
along sea-fronts. The building was packed ; but
the bodyguard, nothing daunted, flung itself
against the Law which stood across the main
entrance. “ Phwat is ut?” demanded the Law
briefly. “We’re going up on the platform,”
replied the bodyguard, in four confident
voices. “Y’ are not!” the Law announced,
with some dignity. “Bu-but,” protested the
four voices, “We’re Mr. Judkins’s body-
guard! We’re going on the platform!” “Y’
are not!” reiterated the Law, “an’ be off!”
Disconsolate and drooping, the bodyguard left
and went out into the chill darkness, arid spent
the rest of the evening on the kerbstone, waiting
(without so much as a pipeful of mild tobacco or a
taste of something short to while away the cold
and weary hours) until Juddy should finish his
discourse on the rottenness of fresh air.
UNCONSCIOUS HUMOR
AT A RECENT
LECTURE.
Without doubt
man is the most
beautiful of all
God’s creations.
Will Dyson’s first London caricature ap-
pears in Thk World for July 26—a full page, m
color. The subject is John Corlett, editor of the
Pink-’Un. Thk World announces its capture of
“the brilliant young Australian” in a jubilant
half-column, headed “ Our Imperial Cartoonist.”
It is of opinion that his “ daring, vigorous, char-
acteristic work ” will “ start a new era in English
caricature.”
John Lancashire Harris,
one of the oldest journalists in
Australia, saw his last formes to
press the other day at New-
castle. He had been seeing
formes to press in N.S.W. for 64
years; among others, those of
Henry Parkes’s Empire in the
’5O s. In 1866 he took over the
management of the Southern
Observer, published in the in-
terests of the Anglican diocese of
Goulburn. The organ failed ; and,
with the plant, Harris founded
the first evening penny paper in
the State, the Goulburn Post,
with Henniker Heaton as editor.
A libel action rattled him, and he
had to sell. Next he founded the
Cooma Gazette, and, after selling
that, drifted to Newcastle where,
later on, he started a job-print-
ing business, and also published
the Weekly Despatch and the
Monthly Quiver—the latter
probably suggested by the fact
that he had 15 children.^
A couple of South Mel-
bourne boys brothers are
afflicted with the horribly in-
fectious form of “ loyalty ’’.which
expresses itself in letters to the
King. The elder brother hap-
pened to be born on Nov. 9,
which was also King Edward’s
birthday; so he wrote to the
Crown some years ago and told
it of the wonderful coincidence. ‘
The Crown wrote back ; conse-
quently the younger brother of
the misguided youth couldn’t
grow up in peace until he had
likewise distinguished himself.
He wrote to King George about
his birthday, and got. a letter in reply. The
original infantile grovels are insignificant offences
compared with the crime of the newspaper which
solemnly reports them. Heaven knows how many
other letters from different boys will be written
in vain, or how often the boy who spread the
disease will get his head punched by his neglected
rivals.
THE HERO, THE VILLAIN, GRIEF
AND RUIN.
A villainous tax.
A gross injustice to the men who have displayed
heroism.
The Federal land-tax spells ruination to the squatters.
—News Items.
The villainous land-tax collector is here shown
taking away the last ewe lamb from the ruined
heroic squatter.
By the Oldest Inhabitant: —
Henry Lucy, in his S. M. Herald letter, makes com-
parison between the arrest of John Tawell, the Quaker,
at one time a resident of Sydney, and Hawley Crippen—
both being captured by means of electricity. He errs,
though, when he says that Tawell was arrested at
Slough. “Tawell, getting into the train at Paddington,
secure in the belief that his identity was unknown,
walked out of the carriage at Slough into the arms of a
waiting policeman. The telegraph wire had carried the
description of his appearence and an order for his arrest.”
As a matter of fact, Tawell got into the train at Slough
and-got out at Paddington. The telegraphic message
described him and desired that he should be kept under
surveillance. Next day John the Quaker was arrested
and urgently invited to explain the corpse of Sarah Hart.
And Sarah’s remains being of the unexplainable order,
the world was presently one Quaker short.
The will of Neil Walter Black, a passen-
ger by the Waratah. was proved last week in
Melbourne. The document is dated May Bof
last year, and deals with an estate valued at over
£150,000. The original Australian Neil Black, the
founder of the family, came out in 1839, and
settled at Glenormiston (Vic.). His squatting
partners for some years -were Stewart, of Glen-
ormiston, Scotland'; Finlay, of Argyleshire,
Scotland, and W. E. Gladstone, afterwards
British Prime Minister. The Waratah Black
was seriously inclined. He left £750 to
the Presbyterian Church (Vic.), £5OOO to the
Theological Hall, £lOOO to the Hbme Mission
Fund (both of the Presbyterian brand), £lOOO to
Melbourne Hospital, and £lOOO to Melbourne
University. Legacies are left to cousins and
cousins’ children, and the balance goes in equal
shares to two brothers.
IN 1920.
JAP COMMANDER (at Yass-Canberrn): “ Fly for
your lives, boys! The water supply's dried
up!”
Labor-member Anstey made a brilliant
maiden speech—maiden as far as the Federal
Parliament is concerned—on the Australian Notes
Bill. Not only was it a great feat of memory—
for over an hour he spoke absolutely with-
out notes, quoting authorities, reproducing
statistics and deducing calculations with exact-
ness—but it was such a keenly argued and logical
defence of the Bill that the Fisher Ministry must
a;most have been persuaded to stick to its own
measure instead of cutting away pretty well every
feature of it that mattered.
Adelaide Register has found a veteran who
claims to be the only survivor of the wreck of the
Monumental City' on Gabo Island
(near the. Victorian and N.S.W.
border) in August, 1853, There
were 47 who scrambled ashore on a
hawser through the surf, and had
to walk 60 miles along the beach
to the nearest settlement. How
he knows what has since become
of the other 46 is not stated. The
veteran’s name is John Simmons,
and he found gold in the old days
at Bathurst and the Ovens. He is
80 years old, has had 13 children
(eight living), has seen men lynched
on the Californian diggings, and
has been stuck up by bushrangers
within sight of Pentridge (Mel-
bourne).-
Wilbur Chapman, the Yankee
boss of the recent Chapzander ex-
cursion to these parts, has had a
little lot of £46,000 left to him
unconditionally by John H. Con-
verse, a Philadelphia millionaire.
John 11. it was who financed the
cheapjack missioners to Australia ;
and when things were cleaned up-
at the other end, after the tour was
over, John H. didn’t have to part a
cent. —Chapzander had made Australia do all the
paying. Wherefore, apparently, Wilbur gets
rewarded with £4G,000. Converse, by the way,
started a 3 a journalist, but found he was cut out
for business, so dropped ink and became It in the
Baldwin railway works.
The Bulletin gets a mysterious note from
North Queensland :
Concerning Sir Frederick Pottinger, who was supposed
to have shot himself after his failure as a police officer to
capture bushranger Gardiner, and after the yarn had
been spread that Pottinger and Gardiner were one and
the same (B. 11/8/TO). Pottinger didn’t die. In fact, I’m
Pottinger. I have been in the North for some years, and
mate with an Irish patriot who killed his father’s
betrayer in a hut opposite pennant hill quarry, on the
kissing point Road—many years ago a man named
Savage, a young man disguised as an old one—he avenged
a wrong. We are both hale and hearty yet.
But The Bulletin has serious doubts about its
Pottinger.
Death has been busy with Adelaide men
the last fortnight, and has removed John Bagot,
director of all sorts of companies; Berry Smith,
secretary of the Lewis Motor Co. (killed, on a
bicycle, by a tramcar); and three lawyers—
Auguste Davies, a veteran, and two others in the
prime of life, William Culross and Tom Gall.
Culross passed out while away on a visit to Eng-
land ; Gall fell dead at lunch in a crowded room.
Though Adam Lindsay Gordon died as far
back as 30 years ago, his wife is still living. Her
home is near Bordertown, in the south-east of
South Aus. After the poet’s death, she married
a Mr. Lowe, and now owns a grown-up family.
Lowe is a farmer. She is quite willing
to talk to visitors about her first husband,
whom she married when she was a girl,
and her present husband seems to value as
much as she does the few things she has that used
to be the poet’s. The family is musical, although
one member of it does include the bagpipes in his
repertoire.
John Jacob, one of Adelaide’s oldest
inhabitants, died last week, aged 94. He came out
to Hobart Town in 1838, but passed at once to
S. Aus., and went on living there for 72 years. A
brother who was there before him helped Light to
lay out the capital. In 1839 John moved to
Sydney, purchased 100 heifers, and overlanded
them to Adelaide. Then he grew more heifers,
but repeated droughts ruined him. In the end he
settled down as Clerk of Courts at Mount
Gambier, and went on issuing summonses and
signing dog-tax receipts until the caterpillar be-
came a burden.
In Melbourne, the other day, administra-
tion was applied for in the estate of JohnEbsworth,
solicitor, “who is supposed to have died about
July 27, last year.” Poor Jack Ebsworth was a
passenger to England by the Waratah, and
wouldn’t allow himself to be scared into quitting
the boat at Durban. Never another Australian
lawyer in the profession could have lasted six
rounds against Ebsworth. In his younger days,
after he had done some soldiering, he was a
champion boxer of the British navy, and he was
still a fine muscular citizen, in the prime of life
when he started on his last voyage —and a real
white man besides.
John Bagofc, a pastoralist and Broken Hill
magnate, who died in Adelaide on August 28,
was. a school-chum of Kingston’s. He owned the
Peak station, near Alice Springs, in the early
’7o’s, and was the first white man to greet
explorer John Forrest when the big fellow
pushed through from Champion Bay to the over-
land telegraph line. He gave big John “the best
dinner I ever ate in my life.” It included roast
beef, which the explorer had not tasted for
months. Bagot was three years a politician (that
was a quarter of a century ago), but he soon
tired of such things and fled to a beautiful garden
in the Adelaide hills.
No Englishman has ever given such a picture of Aus-
tralia as Australians have themselves provided. Millions
of people who have never seen your country get their
impressions from the writings of your own folk. In all
my reading I have never come across such depreciation
of a land as I found during the months I devoted all my
leisure to reading stories or poems written about Aus-
tralia by Australians. The general impression was one of
sadness. If you say these things concerning your own
land, is it a matter of surprise that people on far distant
shores should believe you? —Eoster Fraser's Book.
Samuel Lyons, the ancient N.S.W. Par-
liamentarian who died recently, was at one time
an Official Assignee, and gave up the office under
circumstances that caused a great sensation—
his confidential clerk bolted with the office
books and such assets as he could annex. Nothing
was ever seen or heard afterwards of clerk,
account books or assets.
WHEN DEAKIN ANSWERS DEAKIN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The dual burdens of Mr. Deakin’s speech against the
Land Tax Bill are that the measure is unconstitutional,
and that it is an abuse of Federal power. . . . Mr. Hughes
made Mr. Deakin of last j T ear and the previous years back
to 1893 answer the Mr. Deakin of the previous two hours.
—Melbourne Aon, 81/8/’lO.
The fearsome ghosts of yesterdays
And yesteryears have risen ;
And each grim spectre sadly says :
“ Those views were surely his’n !
He is the man who once Believed
With proof his words are reekin’";
And Tory hearts are deeply grieved
When Deakin answers Deakin !
It is the voice of Mister Hughes
That calls from dim seclusion
These wraiths of old, discarded view's
That helped to wreck the Fusion !
And Joseph Cook and Forrest tpo,
For shelter swiftly sneakin’,
Feel ghastly tremors passing through
When Deakin answers Deakin !
How sad that ancient years should mock,
And olden days unsleepin’
Should help to bear the hopeless stock
Of legislators weepin’!
These ghosts whose old, unburied bones
In Hansard’s vaults are creakin’,
They fill the Tory’s soul with groans
When Deakin answers Deakin !
All men, indeed, must come to grief
Whose views too often alter:
Old spectres rise—with language brief
The beastly truth they falter !
They mock the Statesman and the Fuse
With ancient voices shriekin’;
And ... joy infests the heart of Hughes
When Deakin answers Deakin !

The bank has sold many properties on time payment;
and if these are paid for according to contract, and if
somebody can be got to buy at a fair price the balance of
the properties which have had slices sold out of them,
the directors say the special reserve will amount to about
£85,000.
Naturally this estimate cannot be tested in any
serviceable way. If, however, the directors’ figures are
all right, then every £1 of the deferred and ordinary
capital will be swollen to very nearly £5. How or when
the deferred and ordinary shares are to benefit by this
accumulation isn’t clear. The circular issued on January
26, 1905, said: “These shares rank as to capital im-
mediately after the present preference shareholders
shall have received 355. per share, and as to dividend
after 6 per cent, has been paid on the 30s.”— the latter
being the amount of the new. pref. shares. Further :
“All surplus realisations will be placed to a reserve
fund, and will accrue for the benefit of the deferred pref.
and ordinary shares in proportion to the amount re-
spectively paid up thereon.” But that doesn’t make it
clear whether sooner or later these people are to get the
accumulation in cash or in new shares, or whether they
will get the net earnings of the fund in the shape of
increased dividends. At present apparently the interest
on this reserve goes into the general account;
and, if that is so, it isn’t quite a fair thing so far
as the holders of these shares are concerned. The doubt
which surrounds the matter might very well be cleared
up.
As properties are paid for, use is found for the
money, chiefly in new advances. A few years ago some
debt was paid off ; but the co. says it can find profitable
use for the money, and retains it when it can. The fol-
various movements :

Under the 1906 agreement one-third of the old fixed
deposits, carrying 3J per cent., will be payable this
month ; but the co. is inviting depositors to let the
money remain at 4 per cent, till 1915, when the whole lot
will be due. Whatever may be said about the rate of
interest offered, the security is, no doubt, all right now,
unless some very bad and unforeseen accident happens to
Victoria.

There is an atmosphere of Law and Costs about the
Equity. At various times within the last few years bar-
risters Higgins and Box, now on the Bench, have been on
the Board; and Irvine, McArthur and Mackinnon
are now directors. If it is an advantage for a
trustee co. to have law on the premises, the Equity
is the most advantaged trustee co. in Australia. In
drawing up the accounts the lawyers seem always
to have the words of the policeman in their ears : “ You
are not bound to say anything ; but anything you do say
will be taken down in writing and may be used against
you at your trial.” Wherefore they say nothing—or as
little as possible. They lump together all their income,
no matter how derived ; and they don’t even hint at the
value of the estates in hand. Fortunately, the law com-
pels them to furnish certain information in their balance-
sheet ; and so it is possible to get these comparisons:—
June,’oo. June,’os. June,’lo.
Liabilities .. .. £143 £524 £llB
Real estate .. .. 9,069 15,962 15,962
Mortgages ... .. 4,559 721 575
Liquid assets .. 16,903 25,729 37,959
So the surplus of liquid assets over liabilities has grown
from £25,205 to £37,841 in five years, which isn’t bad on
a capital of £25,000, especially considering the dividends
that have been paid. Even if the office’s law should be
bad, the shareholders have a very substantial buffer to
protect thbir capital; while, as for clients, they have the
still further protection of £lOO,OOO of uncalled capital.

Ten years ago the capital was £112,500 ; but on a revalua-
tion of assets it was reduced to £lOO,OOO, and some small
reserves were also written off. At the same time the
business was reorganised. Another change has now been
decided on : 25,000 more £1 shares are to be issued at par.
Why they should be issued at par isn’t clear, seeing that
the shares have lately been worth from 245. to 255., and
an extra, say, 3s. 4d. of premium capital would come in
very handy for reducing the still unpleasantly large
mortgage debt (£60,500). Of the £25,000 to be raised
£15,000 is to go towards wiping off that debt, and the
rest into the business. The co. owns its freehold '
premises, now valued at £103,625 without fittings. The
fact that it has such a large amount of its capital in free-
hold has told against big returns. The co. that pays
rent on, perhaps, a 4J or 5 per cent, basis, and uses its
capital in the business proper, can naturally show better
returns than the co. which has put a large part of its
capital into the same kind of premises. On the other
hand while the business may fly away the premises can’t;
so the co. that owns its premises offers the best security.
Further, the co. which depends on hired premises
is always more or less at the mercy of its landlord. As
an investment, therefore, shares in a trading concern—
and especially a retail trading concern—which hasn’t got
its own premises can be viewed with a good deal more
suspicion than those in a co. like the Mutual Store.
Certainly the Mutual Store’s advantage is to some extent
discounted by its heavy mortgage. A good deal of the
profit for some years past has gone towards getting rid
of that. Five years ago it stood at £68,000 ;so £7500 has
gone that way meantime. One of the inducements held
out to shareholders to subscribe to the new issue is that
“ the reduction of the loan to £45,000 would leave future
profits available for their legitimate objects”—which pre-
sumably means dividends. The escape frojn pawn is,
however, just as legitimate an object as dividend-paying ;
and if the directors stop at £45,000 their heels will have
to be trodden on. The amounts shown in the table as
written off during the past few terms are the cost of tea-
room additions—an item now completely wiped out.

This co. was born 31 years ago in the gilded office of the
Victorian Life and General; and, considering its oppor-
tunities, it ought to be a much bigger and stronger con-
cern than it is. Comparing its funds and its risks, it
may be fairly strong, no doubt; but its risks
are not large enough. In other words, its busi-
ness isn’t what it should be. This is no doubt
largely due to the shareholders’ excessive thirst for divi-
dends. An insurance co. can’t have its profits and pay
them away too; and the insuring public is only con-
cerned with the profits a co. has put by in its stocking or
jam-tin. In the past four very prosperous years theco.
has made profits totalling £76,894 ; and of that fine lot it
has put by only £9488. The shareholders have taken 87J
per cent. ; and only 12J per cent, has gone into
the fund which guarantees to insurers the payment
of their policies. Naturally, this doesn’t attract
the public. And the co.’s funds are not so strong that
it needn’t worry about strengthening them. The net
premiums are the only available basis for estimating a
co.’s risks ; and this co.’s funds (capital and reserves)
amount to under 179 per cent, of its premiums. That,
certainly, is a good deal better than the average figures
of British cos. ; but the average of British cos. is far
poorer than that o'f Australian cos. A general view of
the past 15 years can be got from the next little lot of
comparisons:—

1910 .. 94,870 25,471 58,192 26‘8 „ 61 '3 „
The loss rate keeps on the large side; so the very
gradual growth of business isn’t due to theco. severely
winnowing out the risks that offer, and accepting only
the very gilt-edged ones. The expense rate is, on the other
hand, strictly moderate, which points, no doubt, to a
pretty large marine business—the business that costs
less to get than fire insurance, but usually costs
more after it has been got. The income from interest and
rent last year was £5144, which works out at about 3 per
cent, on the invested funds. The best that can be said
for this very poor return is that £73,138 is on fixed
deposit, which is a much more proper investment for a
fire insurance co.’s funds than mortgages, seeing that the
money is liable to be called for in large lumps in a hurry.
The weak point is that another £46,330 —almost the full
amount of the capital—is in real estate; and it is pro-
bably that which drags down the interest return. May-
be the co. doesn’t charge itself much for rent; if so,
it improves the look of its expense rate by casting asper-
sions on the character of its assets ; and there isn’t much
profit in that.

This little co. was formed 21 years ago to take over the
fire business of the Victoria Life and General when the
latter decided to stick to life only and do no more even of
that. There is, however, another fire, marine, accident
and guarantee co. in the same stable : and though it
probably gets some of the bigger co.’s reinsurances, it
isn’t fed lavishly, and its business dwindles :

The loss rate hak been unusually heavy, probably owing
to the big maritime disasters early in the year. The co. s
capital is £20,000; and that and the reserves are about
equally divided between public securities, real estate,
and liquid balances.

This co., formed 51 years ago, is waiting for the last
policy-holder to die—it gave up issuing new policies over
20 years back. The last policy-holder isn’t being hurried,
naturally ; for the longer he lives and pays up premiums,
the better it will be for shareholders. If an insurance
office reckons that a man will live 40 years, and calcu-
lates accordingly, the money he pays in after the 40th
year swells the bonuses when bonuses are paid ; but
when an office doesn’t pay bonuses, that money simply
swells the pockets of the shareholders. Of the present
funds apart from capital, £143,010 is assurance fund ;
and that, presumably, is about the present value of the
co.’s liabilities under its contracts. There is, in addi-
tion to that, £27,310 of reserves and the capi-
tal (£40,000). These latter figures give no idea,
though, of the amount the shareholders may get
out of the business; for, as remarked just now,
the man who lives long past his expectalion-of-life period
is a little gold mine to a pure proprietary concern of this
kind. And it has practically no risks beyond the ques-
tion whether its assets will bring 20s. in the £. An office
that is taking new business may be hit by an epidemic
which sweeps off clients before their due time ; but this
office has left all that behind it—or nearly all—for its
policy-holders must have pretty well lived their allotted
span, or thereabouts.

The last three lines need explaining. Twelve months
ago there were 100,000 shares paid to 11s. AlO per cent,
dividend was then paid plus a bonus of Is., and at the
same time a Is. call was made. This year the usual 10
per cent, dividend is paid, with a bonus of 35.; and a
call of 3s. is made at the same time. That explains
two lines. Now for the middle one. The co. and
the Sydney City Council had a difference of opinion
about the value of land which the council wanted to resume
at the Flemington saleyards. The price ultimately fixed
was £11,750 ; and as the directors “ consider the balance
of the land adjoining the yards is worth more to the co.
than what it stands at in the books, they have decided to
transfer £lO,OOO of the amount to credit of Reserve
Fund.” More than most cos., Pitt, Son and Badgery
deserves the good time it is having. Born in 1888, which
wasn’t a good time for a pastoral-finance co. to be born,
it was soon in trouble; but it put its shoulder to the
grindstone and its nose to the wheel and paid absolutely
no dividend at all until it had apparently got the mess
cleaned right up. And then, apparently to put itself out
of temptation, as it got the old dead-horse worked
off it put the accumulated profits and its other available
resources into freeholds—partly saleyard property, but
mostly city office premises and wool and produce stores.
There may be less profit in that investment than in
pastoral-finance business; but there are also fewer
losses. Further, either by lucky chance or by a good
piece of business foresight, the co, laid itself out for the
fat-stock selling business just when that business was
best worth having. The high price.of wool has given a
big impetus to sheep-growing; and during the good
seasons the flocks have increased enormously. The
stock passings through the Sydney yards, for local
eating and export, have consequently been extra-
ordinarily heavy. This, the co.’s comparatively small
liabilities nowadays, and the income from rents; etc., are
responsible for the very fine profits of the past year or
two.

Altogether a fine 10 years’ history. That recent results
will continue is, nevertheless, too much to hope for.
Seasons will vary in the future, no doubt, as they have
in the past—seasons in which the fat stock coming for-
ward will barely supply local requirements; and seasons
of poor wool prices and shrunken commissions from that
source and from property sales. And when that time
comes theco. will be lucky if it can keep its connection
without allowing itself to be squeezed into going into the
pastoral-finance business more extensively. Still, when
all is said and done, there will be less danger in doing it
then than there might be in doing it during the present
pastoral boom.

The published accounts put it another way : they show
reserves of £61,614, but they also show a paper asset
(goodwill) of £22,500. In the foregoing the latter has
been disregarded, it being merely froth on the beer ; and,
judging by the fact that the directors have accumulated
a “goodwill reserve "of £15,500, it is proposed to pre-
sently blow this froth off in a formal way. The co.
was floated in 1902. During the previous year or two
Sydney had been a good deal in the habit. of
asking itself to comeanavadrink, that being the period
of the visit of the ducal pair. The flotation was on the
insufficient basis of 3J years’ figures, and on that basis a
capital of £550,000 didn’t look excessive. But Sydney’s
thirst eased off, and two or three bad years happened
along ;so the div. dropped to 4 per cent. Then the two
Toohey estates did an extraordinary thin"-. They said :
“It seems you paid too much. Take some of it back ”
which shows how demoralising; the liquor business can be.
They threw in 50,000 shares; and then the other 500,000
were written down to 165,, making; the capital £400,000.
This has helped the situation wonderfully. The good-
will stood originally at £85,000; and as £62,500 was
written off this, while £168,000 (capital and reserves) was
written off altogether, it .follows that £105,500 was avail-
able for writing down assets other than goodwill. Yet,
though that was pretty severe pruning, profits have been
steadily appropriated for further writing-down purposes.
The record in that respect since the reconstruction has
been as follows :
Jan., 1907 ~ ..£2500 Jan., 1909 .. ..£3OOO
July, 1907 .. ... 2500 July, 1909 .. .. 3000
Jan., 1908 .. .. 2500 Jan., 1910 .. .. 4000
July, 1908 .. .. 2500 July, 1910 .. -. 3000
That is £23,000 for four years’ depreciation. What that
works out at per annum can’t be told from the accounts,
because brewery, plant and pub and other premises are
all thrown into one huge barrel. Originally the pub
property was valued at £124,300. Nothing has been
written off this asset —nothing visible, that is to say,
and there is no telling whether anything has been written
off internally. Something could be written off without
the accounts giving any hint of it; the money, form-
stance, might be spent on additions. When a co. tells so
little about itself as this co. does, many things may
happen—good things or bad things—without making a
ripple on the accounts ; and at the best the published;
document can only be taken as a general indication of
the way things are moving.
Next come some Toohey details —the few that
it is possible to give:—

This co. hasn’t yet got to the happy state in which it is 1
able to keep a strong-room stuffed with Treasury bills
and liquid assets of that sort. So far, it has found use
for all its undivided profit in the business ; all that it has
done otherwise is to reduce its liabilities a trifle. The;
declared profits in excess of the dividends in the four
years since the reconstruction have been £76,217. The
directors have written £23,000 off against depreciation,
leaving £53,217 for formal reserves, equal to an average
of 3£ per cent, per annum. Very much depends on the
vigor with which the pub-property asset is maintained,
or written down where necessary ; but on the record as
it stands, the co. is fairly entitled to the extra 1 percent,
dividend it now gets.

But all the profit shown in the last line wasn’t trading!
profit. Two or three years ago the co. had a fire at its
city warehouse, and a lot of damage was done. After a
while it decided on something more elaborate in pre-
mises, and in 1908-9 £32,516 was put into buildings and
plant. Now “ all the old city properties have been sold at
a considerable ad vance over book values, thus enabling the
directors to recommend a much larger allocation to
Reserve Fund.” Unfortunately it is not possible to say
how much of the £20,083 came from this transaction in
old mortar, and how much from ordinary trading;
wherefore in considering Kaiapois as an investment, the
past year’s figures had better be blotted out of recollec-
tion altogether. The accounts ought to have put things
differently. The paid capital has been further increased
during the year. Originally there was only one class of
shares ; but the co. wanted money when Maoriland was
not feeling very well, and so it had to offer a preference. j
There are now 22,209 ordinaries and 7949 preferences, all
fully paid to £5. This increase of capital and the sale of
property assets have between them affected various
other figures. Recent movements can be followed from
this

The liabilities are still too big. Book debts have also
taken a big jump. If that is due to a quick extension of'
business, well and good. It may, however, be due to a
poorer response to the debt collector, which isn’t so well
and good.

Feldheim, Gotthelf and Co.’s 43-year-old
Sydney business is being offered to the public* The firm;
is a wholesale dealer in fancy goods ; it suffered years ago
in one of Sydney’s big fires, and did a thing that deserves
remembering—it paid the salaries and wages of its
thrown-out employees until they could either be taken
on again or get something else to do. The two senior
partners now go out; a third remains as managing
director. The public is asked to take 100,000 shares ; and
the vendors apply for 30,000. Of the £130,000 the vendors
take £77,192. The position is :
Assets £116,243
Less Liabilities .. .. 59,051
Net assets .. .. £57,192
Add Goodwill .. .. 20,000 .
Purchase price.. .. £77,192
“ The return, calculated on the average annual profits
for the past four years, is over 7 per cent, on this
amount.” Seven per cent, would mean £5403 per
annum. The average net. sales are, said by the auditors
to have been £232,332; so the average profit has been no
more than about 2§ per cent, on the sales —an extra-
ordinarily small return, probably due to the firm
having to pay dearly for accommodation. Anyway,
the profits on that turnover have been absurdly low. If
all the capital is called up, £130,000 will be available.
The vendors take £77,192, leaving £62,808 to reduce lia-
bilities. The capital will thus be none too big for the
business ; for it is pretty certain that if the average
annual sales are £232,332, the assets are ordinarily more
than £116,243, and the liabilities therefore more than the
present £59,051. It is said that the two senior partners
have acquired a competency and therefore seek retire-
ment. Under those circumstances, as the business has
clearly been in need of more capital, it is a fair thing to
ask why they haven’t put their resources into the busi-
ness. On the profits of the past four years of exceptional
national prosperity the proposition is not at all impress-
ive ; but the business is evidently there, and with the
new capital it may be quite possible to show better
results. The Dixson Trust has done the underwriting.

Mayne Nickless Motor Carriers, Ltd., is a
new Melbourne proposition, now offered to the public.
It is in 50,000 shares, cut up this way : Vendors, 5000;
promoters and underwriters, 4000; public, 21,000; re-
served, 20,000. Besides the 9000 shares, promoters and
vendors take £BOOO cash. The purchase price is thus, so
far as the public is concerned, £17,000, of which £7370
stands for plant and £9630 for goodwill. The prospectus
mentions that the vendor co. gets £4630 for goodwill;
but to that must be added the promoters’ 5000 shares.
True, they underwrite, or secure underwriting for,
8000 shares—Booo out of 21,000. For the service

The most modern, simple and effective Vacuum
Slimes Table is the “ Wilfle.v.” It is continuous, and con-
sists of a revolving drum which is partly submerged in a
tank of slimes or material to be filtered. The drum is
covered with a filter cloth supported on grooves on the
drum, which are connected by means of holes to the
interior to allow the liquid to be withdrawn. Through
the trunnions at the ends of the drum the vacuum pipe
passes to the interior. This pipe connects with the
interior of the drum, through which the liquid and air
are withdrawn by means of a vacuum pump. The filtered,
slime is removed by a simple apparatus placed at or
below the level of the pulp in the tank. So that directly
the cake is removed the surface, of the filter cloth as it
revolves is immediately re-immersed in the pulp ready to
receive a fresh cake, thereby preventing the sucking in
of air, and consequent loss of vacuum between the time
the cake is removed and a fresh one is forming. The
residual liquid in the slime cake is removed by distribu-
ting water over the surface of the semi-dried cake. Owing
to the fact that the filter is circular in form, it will be
seen that it is continuous in operation, and has no com-
plication of valves to get out of order ; furthermore,
work is being done continuously during the whole revolu-
tion of the filter drum. The Austral Otis Engineering
Company, of South Melbourne, have the sole manufactu-
ring rights of this filter,* [2

they render they earn their money very easily. Over
10,000 shares had been applied for in Melbourne up to
Monday. No statement of the profits of the vendor co.
is made ; all that is published is a statement that “ the
promoters have employed Messrs. Strangward and
Shackell, accountants, to investigate the business of the
vendor co., and as a result of such examination, are satis-
fied that such business is a perfectly sound and improv-
ing one, making good profits, and capable of enormous
expansion.” Even this, it will be noted, is not the report
of the accountants ; it is merely the opinion of the pro-
moters—who will have the command of 5000 shares if the
co. is floated. As to the future—especially of the motor-
delivery business—everything is a matter of opinion only.
If motor-carrying is a great success, this co., having the
Mayne-Nickless business as a foundation, will no doubt
stand an excellent chance of getting some of the cream
of it.

Manly Palace Pier Co.—The promoters of
this co. ask the public for £85,000 and take 15,000 free
shares themselves. The object is to build a pier at Manly
(N.S.W.), with shops, music hall, promenade, etc. The
business is quite new to Australia. Some cos. of the kind
have had great success in England and other parts ; and
this one may be a great success here. It is purely a
matter of opinion. The contractors, who have carried
out numerous similar works, will take £5OOO of
the contract price (£65,000) in shares. The vendors and
promoters for their 15,000 shares sell a concession from
the Manly Council; and they are also apparently offering
some of the shares by way of a bonus to applicants for
large parcels—which is a sort of half-way house on the
road to underwriting. One doubt expressed is than the
structure, it built, would be liable to be swept away by a
storm. Nobody knows, certainly, how hard some future
storm may rage ; but competent engineering opinion on
the subject is quite reassuring.

Mack, Ltd.—This underwriting business wants
looking into. In many cases it is simply a new invention
for taking a second bite out of the public. In this case
the right to make and sell a new building slab—a cheap
and apparently effective substitute for bricks in partition
work—is offered to a co. in 50,000 shares. Of that num-
ber the public is offered 20,000, the vendors take 25,000,
and 5000 go to the underwriters. These people are sup-
posed to have underwritten the whole 20,000 shares ; yet
“ the co. may be registered when 10,000 shares have
been applied for.” In any case, the underwriters
get one free share for every four shares they under-
write, plus 6d. per share selling commission. So 500
shares, which would cost the public £5OO, or £1 each
(fully paid), will cost the underwriter £390, or 15s. 6d.
per share. Thereafter, while the public cannot make a
profit by selling at less than 20s. 3d., the underwriter can
make the same profit by selling at 15s. 9d. From the
promoter’s point of view, this underwriting may look a
beautiful scheme ; but the public will yet drop to it that
the thing is loaded.

Owing to doubts having been expressed as to
the old firm’s true profits, and also as to the position of
the newco. in relation to certain law-suits, the prospectus
of Bowron Bros. Trading 00. has beeii withdrawn. When
the concern is next offered it will have the backing of
three accountants’ reports. Still, if it had this time had
the backing of 50 accountants’ reports the result would
have been the same ; what it lacked was the backing of
the broker -.

The new Australian fire and marine insurance
co., mentioned last week as being in the incubator, is
to call itself the Insurance Office of Australia, Ltd. It
is to start off with a paid capital of £75,000 —an unusually
large amount for a new office ; but the promoters are
assured of a large enough business to pay fair interest
on the amount. From the policy-holder’s point of view
the bigger the paid capital the better ; so the size of it
will no doubt attract business. The promoters are
Messrs. Stockfeld and Doherty, managers for foreign
offices hitherto, and both of them vigorous and experi-
enced men. But there are to be no promoters’ shares—
all they get is an option over a block of unissued shares
at par.

In addition to these reserves there is a contingency fund
of £5OOO, presumably to protect the co. in case it over-
draws on its consignments, and a small fire and accident
fund. During the half-year 35,000 new £1 shares were
issued at a premium of £l. This money was not
wanted; the issue Was obviously made with a view
to allowing shareholders to make a bit out of
the market if they' felt that way. Hence, though the
new mill has been paid for, and though the co. has paid
out £28,000 in divs. in the six months, there was £82,174
cash in hand at June 30. The surplus of liquid assets at
that date was £91,047, as against £18;998 on December
31, a gain of £72,049. Of that the shareholders put up
£70,000, leaving £2049 as the gain from the mine, plus the
£28,000 paid in divs. Besides acquiring this £30,049 of
cash or its equivalent, the co. paid £19,351 for plant, and
also did some shaft sinking.
The gross profit is shown above as £45,120, of
which £4llB is written off for development (money, that
is, previously spent on mining, but charged to capital and
not to working account). Take the profit, apart from
wear and tear, as £40,000. This, on the 108,943 tons
treated, is equal to 7s. sd. per ton. No estimate of
reserves is made now. Six months ago manager Weir
mentioned 1,663,000 tons. The 1100 ft. body is bigger
than was thought then; so, in spite of the extraction,
those figures can stand. At 7s. sd. per ton that lot
would be worth about £622,500, or £3 11s. per share.
That isn’t knocking off anything for depreciation, or
allowing anything for renewal of plant; on the other
hand, it doesn’t take in the £82,000 of cash now in hand.
Also (1) it is based on the past half-year’s metal values,
and metal values are uncertain cattle ; (2) it doesn’t take
into account anything below the 1100 ft., though from all
appearances there is a good deal below 1100 ft. ; and (3) it
is based on the manager’s estimates of quantity. The
Bulletin hasn’t measured the ore ; but it has measured
manager Weir, and gives him a first-class certificate.
G H Blakemore thinks better of Main Ridge
Deep Lead (N.S.W.) than some people, and has become
the co-’s consulting engineer. He will probably have
something to do. Pretty plainly all the wash will need
crushing, and the profit on the quantity that the present
D lant will handle isn’t worth considering. The chances
are therefore, that some scheme for raising money to
get’more plant will bejet loose shortly.
There will be razors in the air at the next East
Greta Coal Co.’s meeting, according to present appear-
ances The co. once held the lease of an adjoining block
of coal land, but threw it up on the ground that it
wouldn’t be wanted for a very long while—2o years was
mentioned— and that it wouldn’t pay to go on handing
out rent all that time. Now, however, though not half
20 years have passed, the co. is officially recommended to
buv the lease; and some shareholders think they smell
something. The Melbourne people have taken the matter
up, and are stirring vigorously.
Queen Bee (N.S.W.), after living on hopes.of
something turning up, has come to the end of its six
months’ labor-exemption, and has buckled-to again—in
moderation. Funds won’t run to doing anything in im-
moderation. The co.’s best hope was that the Great
Cobar would find the surface heaps of seconds good
enough to buy; but, after sampling, the big co. declined
business.
* * •* *
Kangiara Proprietary (N.S.W.) proposes a
reconstruction. It got the Red Bird lease as a second
barrel to its gun ; and nowit proposes to sell this second
barrel, though its hope of ever doing anything with the
other one isthelate Mr. Buckley’s. But it only proposes to
do the selling to itself. Holders of old shares may apply
for an equal number of shares in the new co. ; that is to
say, they can get one contributing share for 6d. with a
paid-up share thrown in. It is really a scheme by wjiich
the shareholders are bound to pay up 6d. a share or lose
their interest in the only part of the assets that looks
worth anything at all. You can take a horse to the public-
house and give him a corkscrew, but you can’t make him
drink. All the same, you can make it mighty un-
pleasant for him if he doesn’t.
* * * *
Grafton copper mine (N.S.W.) is keeping
three furnaces in blast, and sending out from 80 to 90 tons
of copper per month. In spite of this output mine
developments so far sustain the reserves. Expenses have
always been heavy ; and the chief struggle at present is
to reduce the fuel bill. Firewood is used, and the rever-
beratory furnaces swallow an enormous quantity. Blast
furnaces have been much talked about; but consulting-
engineer Blakemore wants to see more mine development
first.
* * * *
The directors got a “doing ” at the Associated
(W.A.) meeting in London. Two of them who offered
themselves for re-election and had the support of the
others were replaced by Benjamin Brookman and Edward
Hooper, while the item of £990 for extra remuneration
was rudely deleted from the accounts by an unapprecia-
tive meeting. One member of the Board, who visited
Kalgoorlie at a cost of £525, expressed the opinion that
the plant, on which nearly half a million had been
expended before 1906 and £69,000 since, is a bit out-of-
date and that a new one is wanted. Someone ventured
to say that £525 was too much to pay for this informa-
tion ; but having already knocked a good lump off the
directors’ pay, the meeting let the matter drop.
* * * *
This was the chairman’s belated but true state-
ment of the position of the Associated : “Shareholders
must recognise that the mine is not a rich one. It is a
low-grade property, and for the purposes of dividend the
ore must be treated in a very big way. The manager
has therefore recommended, and Professor Liveing has
agreed, that the Merton furnaces should be dismantled,
and fresh Edwards roasters installed. The co. has plenty
of money in hand, so there is nothing to worry about in
this connection. In addition to cash in hand, there are
also large assets in the shape of tailings, which, in due
course, will be treated.” In other words, The Bulletin’s
oft-repeated contention that the mine is patchy, and, on
the whole, poor, is borne out from the chair; and the
official admission is made that the plant is still far off
from perfection (as far off, perhaps, as it was in the early
days of the mine, when Chairman Landau said the co.
would have been better off if, instead of buying the equip-
ment, it had burnt a £300,000 bank note); also it is
admitted that the past sacrifice of extraction for high
tonnage and low costs has left a certain amount of re-
coverable gold in the tailings.
* * * *
Professor Liveing, in his brief cabled report on
the Associated, was. filled with perplexity, but had to
confess that there was only an indefinite quantity of ore
of an indefinite value in sight, and that some mining
ought to be done. Apropos, it is said that the Persever-
ance directors waited on the Associated Board and
proffered a scheme of amalgamation; but the Associated
would not consent to deal until Professor Liveing’s full
report arrived. The Professor, in view of the difficulties
of his task, and the necessity of explaining several pre-
vious explanations, has given up a proposed Visit to Fiji,
and wrestles with the full report on the way to England.
It will be thus about six to eight weeks before anything
further is heard of his struggles.
* •» * *
Tindal’s (W.A.) again thrusts itself on public
notice. A number of hands have lately been paid off,
and local reports differ as to the origin of the ore which
the mill has been treating lately. Further, the promise
made to shareholders last February, that enough profit
would be earned this year to enable £33,000 to be paid in
dividends, still shows no sign of fulfilment, and the Co. will
be lucky if some unfeeling thing doesn’t happen before
1911 comes along.
* * * *
As expected, Oroya Links (W.A.) has got into
reduced circumstances. The monthly tonnage has been
cut down to prevent the mill overtaking the mine, and
the management finds the burden of keeping up the
grade so unbearable that the ore will probably have to
be picked. In March last the reserves were estimated at
335. 7d. per ton, but the value of what is reckoned to be
in sight, and what is actually dug out, are two very
different things.

The once despised and rejected Mararoa con-
tinues to do its little bif towards the Westralian gold and
dividend totals. The present co. bought the mine for
under £6500, and has this to its credit: —

June, 1910 .. 10,775 10,500 1093 15,665
The capital is now £15,000 ; and just double that much has
been paid in dividends, with £6OOO odd still in hand at
the end of the half-year, and the mining and treatment
plant pail for. Six months ago the reserves were put at
73,500 tons, worth 375. per ton. Siqce then 15,652 tons
have been treated, and the manager now puts the re-
serves at 65,000 tons, worth 335. 6d. This does not
include anything below No. 6 level, though in a winze
from that level the first 40ft. averaged 345. 6d., and the
next 70ft. averaged 525. 6d. The extent of the ore is,
however, unknown, though it was carried the full width
of the winze, sft. ,■

Mine-engineer Freeman, of Freeman and Hor-
ton, was sent over to Yampi Sound (W.A.), where the
big iron ore deposits are ; and he wires the owners that
he isn’t enthusiastic : “ Only accessible point is near pro-
posed jetty, and there is only small tonnage standing
there, owing to denudation. On other parts of the island
the lodes average about 35ft. wide, and must be mined in
the ordinary way, with great natural difficulty. Inter-
bedded quartzite will reduce the average grade.
Consider undertaking is without commercial value.”
In ■ view of the favorable opinion • recently given
by the W.A. Government Geologist—or his assist;,
ant —the full text of Freeman’s report will he
looked for with interest. The people who picked on
Yampi are the people who also picked on Horn Island,
from which Mount Morgan has hitherto been drawing its
ironstone flux supplies.
* * # * ,
The Havilah, one of Hans Irvine’s Black Range
(W.A.) floats, slipped on and off the dividend list in 15:08,
and hasn’t been able to get back again. The capital is
£42,000; but only £18,250 of cash was put up, and the
vendors took £12,000 of that. So only £6250 was really
put into the mine ; and, besides £5250 that has come out
in dividends, there is £6115 waiting in net liquid assets,
mostly cash. The co. would have shown up better in the
matter of dividends if it hadn’t had to make the mine
pay for equipment; but they say that drain is over for
the time. Besides very fair reserves of lldwt. or 12dwt.
stone underground, there are 15,000 tons of 4jdwt. slimes
on the surface ; and the directors feel now like having a
dig at the slimes dump.
* * * * >
Mount Morgan’s run for the month looks worse
than it is. On the surface it seems as if there was a drop
from £88,994 in July to £49,386 in August. But the
works are in the change-over stage, consequent on, the
use Of Many Peaks flux instead of barren ironstone. The
converters, therefore, couldn’t get to the matte, and
over £26,000 worth of metal, not counted in the
return, is awaiting final treatment at the mine.
There has been some trouble with the altered furnaces ;
but that sort of thing is inevitable. The co.’s posi-
tion, giving all that in, is extraordinarily strong. At
the end of last half T year (May 31) there was in hand or
transit £25,941 worth of gold and £365,886 worth of
blister copper (at £5O per ton), as against £24,686 of gold
and £187,894 of copper 12 months previously. There had
been this big increase of liquid assets in spite of the
regular shilling dividend. The Many Peaks flux contains
from 28s. to 30s. worth of copper per ton ; and there
ought to be some additional profit in this. Apart from
that, however, it is quite plain that a temporary
trouble at the furnaces will not cause the co.’s financial
managers the slightest concern.

Gympie (Q.) is still dull, but liopeful. No 2
S.E. Great Eastern is down about 1500fc. with its shaft.
It, wants to test the deeper levels of the Inglewood for-
mation. By handling about <[ooo tons a month at low
costs the Scottish Gympie is making profits out of this
Inglewood formation; but it is much wider in the
Scottish than the other mines have had it. South Glnn-
mire and Monkland is also raising crushings from the
Inglewood, and its long crosscut at the 915 ft. level should
be near the reef. East Oriental has improved prospects,
and the week-end amalgam return of 178 oz. from 35 head,
working one shift, indicates a payable crushing. Speci-
men stone near the slide and two good-looking faces 40ft.
apart have firmed these shares.
* * # *
Kelly’s Queen Block, Charters Towers, was so
very dead a few weeks since that call money to do a bit
of prospecting was collected with difficulty, and a num-
ber of shares were forfeitable. But things have changed.
Prospecting was started in June on a cross vein running
at an angle to the Brilliant formation, with poor pros-
pects. The half-yearly report now mentions that driving
has been continued on the cross reef for 56ft., and that
12in. of heavy mineral stone has been showing for the last
20ft. Remembering the good crUshings obtained from this
cross reef some time since in the neighboring Brilliant
St. George, and also the fact that a new tribute was re-
cently taken in the latter, the market is giving more
attention to Kelly’s shares, which have had a substantial
rise. The improved prospects in the winze going down
from the 1613 ft. level in the Brilliant P.O. has given a
more hopeful look to claims further east, and Kelly’s
Block gains from that too.
* * # *
“ Platman ” : There is a flutter at Charters
Towers which threatens to develop into a mild boom.
Mexicans have had a good rise, and some holders are
mighty optimistic—which is not the best sign in the
world, for the knowing Towers crowd generally mouths
the most flattering prophecies while giving selling orders.
Should' the Blocks strike a formation there will be a re-
petition of the boom of two years ago. And the Towers
could do with a shaking-up. Already it has two closed
hotels, and I guess they didn’t bang their doors on
account of an increase in the temperance convictions of
the miners.

During Show week Peter Mcßride, Victoria’s
Minister of Mines, met a deputation of farm*s and such-
like to talk about sludge. You must always talk nicely
to farmers and such-like during Show-time, and Peter did
the right thing. The farmers, etc., had a bad attack of
anti-dredge fever ; and Peter purred, and said he would
not fight against the allowable quantity of solids per
gallon being Cut down from 500 to 400 grains. Yet the
reduction would about snuff out many of the dredgers
and sluicers. Perhaps that doesn’t matter to Peter Mcß.
He has no constituents in the dredging line. True,
Billson has ; but if Billson goes out—well, Peter could
blow as many smoke halos as Minister of Lands as he can
while Minister of Mines.

Bendigo "began to notice its side-lines when nice
stone was hit in the Central Red White and Blue, on the
Sheepshead line. This all comes of the Lansell estate
getting good gold in the Little 180 mine at 500 ft.
With profits showing there, a float of the Central
was just managed. After a bit of poking about, 2Jft.
of rattling good quartz was hit in the Ceritral crosscut at
311 ft. on an east back. Whether it is a mouse or a moose
cannot be told till north and south drives go in. What
can be said is that there did not seem any violent hurry
to give the market the measure of the find. That may be
a detail. What isn’t a detail is that, at last, Parliament
is to have its notice directly drawn to the shepherding
going on in all directions on the Bendigo mines.
The Lansell estate may feel hard hit over the
warden’s decision to ' recommend the forfeiture
of the Sheepshead block next to the Central,
as it is the work of the Lansells at the Little 180 that is
responsible for the revivalJ But public interests say,
“Work or quit!” Peter Mcßride having finished his
bout with the coal lords, and having got a cinoh on
Tewksbury and the dredgers, is itching for a tussle at
Bendigo.

Bright Star (Vic. ), though still suffering from the
big boulder trouble, paid out its first div. lately, and is
now free of debt and with about £5OO in the bank. The
accumulated credit to profit and loss had reached £2824
when the directors decided to have a squaring up; so
£lOOO was written off plant, and £lOOO off the mine.
That, however, is a matter only of bookkeeping. The
things that will appeal to shareholders is that, in spite of
troubles with the heavy ground, two years’ work has
turned a deficit of £2226 into a surplus of £702, with one
little div. paid. The co. has thus far chewed up only
about 13 acres, leaving 141 ahead.
* * * *_
Many thousand shares in the Tasmania Gold
Mine (Tas.) have changed hands, and speculation has
been sustained by reported good developments. But,
although these good reports still drop in, the last run—
£7l4s worth of gold from 5283 tons of stone and a large
quantity of accumulated by-products— cannot be con-
sidered satisfactory. The lode channel at the 1370 ft.
level —the deepest now being worked—is sometimes 10ft.
.wide, and a recent telegram from Launceston said that
7Jft. at the eastern end averaged 14dwt. Good prospects
have algo been reported from the footwall of the reef at
the 1250 ft. level; but as most of the recent crushing
caine from this level, It seems very improbable chat
there is a big tonnage of high-grade stone there.
The present co. was formed in 1903 ; it has got out about
£700,000 worth of gold, but not a penny has come back
in divs. The old co.’s shareholders pocketed over three-
quarters of a million ; but the payments stopped with it
sudden jerk when the old eo. died. To-day the 600,000
£1 shares are quoted at a very doubtful 2s. The old CO.
evidently knew something.

People who suffer from dandruff will find that
the Hygeia Individual Treatment absolutely cures this
trouble.
A Victorian patient who was troubled with dandruff,
also continual falling of the hair, which was very dry and
thin, writes, after using treatment for two months :
“There is now no dandruff left at all, the hair is
beautifully bright and glossy, and is no longer dry and
harsh ; also there is quite a growth of new hair all over,
and none of it is falling very much.”
At the end of the next mouth’s treatmentshe writes:—
“My hair is still improving, and the new growth is
quite an inch and a half long ; also I notice a lot more
new hair growing all over, and it is hardly falling at all.
There has been no sign of dandruff since the second
week’s treatment.—E.S., Armadale, Victoria.”
The President may be consulted, free of charge, any day
but Saturday, between 2.15 and 4.45, and on Wednesday
between 6 and 7. Those who cannot call may write to
the President, Dept. B, Hygeia Limited, Ocean House,
Moore Street, Sydney, enclosing 3d. stamps to cover
postage, and they will receive booklet and testimonials
without delay.*

A
WOMAN’S
LETTER
Sydney, Septembkb 6, 1910.
My Dear Arini,—
Of the Bush Nursing Scheme little is heard
these days. It has apparently dropped into the
ruck or the background ; one recent day the tor-
rent of affluence that poured in amounted to 2s.
The Radium business is the fashion of the moment
—that and Lady Poore’s Bush Book Club. Also
there are still some very faint traces of the Alice
Rawson School for Mothers —an unmarried lady’s
Academy for Parents—but the tracesare very faint.
The Radium concern may last, for apparently it
only requires one lump sum ; but the Book Club is
doomed and the School for Mothers requires
burial. Almost everything that depends on con-
tinuous subscriptions is doomed. It appears to be
an understood thing now that every Important Im-
ported Lady who comes along must start a new
charity or society or something. When phe de-
parts she leaves it behind her —a dead horse
at the door of the local philanthropist. What
with the wives of Governors-General, Gover-
nors’ wives and Admirals’ wives all coming
and going, one new dead horse may be looked
for on the doorstep annually or thereabouts.
The Important Imported Lady moves on. She
goes helping her husband to governor or to
admiral here, there and elsewhere. She takes
her helpful spirit with her. When at last the old
man settles down in peace, she may have the
satisfaction of knowing that she has founded 25
new charities.. She has left them all behind
though, like infants on the doorsteps of many
lands, and not one disturbs her serenity. Other
Important Imported Ladies in the same lino of
business have also started 25 institutions each, and
left them behind. A hundred of them are quite
capable of founding 2500 “ movements ” of one
sort and another. Of course there is nothing
for it save burial. If these things weren’t
buried the affluent and charitable citizeness
who remains behind would have to get in.
and out by the front balcony, all the lower storey
being silted up with dead benevolences. It
appears to me that no one should be allowed to
start a new movement or society or charity or
institution unless he or she (1) gives a substantial
cash guarantee to stand by it for at least ten years,
or (2) deposits the burial expenses with the Town
Clerk. The present method is a shiftless variety
of child-desertion.
All the same, while such a Queen of Hearts as
Lady Poore has proved herself remains with us,
any scheme of hers will get support. Which
gives me the cue to remind you that the Bush
Book Club Fete will occur at Greenoaks on the
I6th of September, and that it will be an after-
noon and evening of merry and numerous revels.
Captain and Mrs. Hore-Ruthven left Sydney
on Saturday, stayed two days with the “Jim”
Osbornes at Gundaroo, and then proceeded to
Melbourne en route for India. The ball given
in their honor on Thursday was unusual in
several ways. Never in the history of this
State has a married couple connected with a
Government House staff so captured the affec-
tions of the populace as to drag it to an entertain-
ment of the sort. It takes an almost frenzied
admiration and regard to stir Sydneyites into
squandering their hard-earned cash on folks who,
however charming, are mere visitors —birds of
passage, here to-day and gone, never perhaps to
return, to-morrow.
Hospitable Mr. Theo Marks gave an immense
dinner at the Australia to the departing pair
before the ball. Lord Dick Nevill, Mr. and Mrs.
Cyril Ward, Mrs. Burdekin, the Ewan Frazers,
T. H. Kellys, Alec Hays, and other of the rank
and fashion of this hamlet were there.
How painfully rare a thing, by the way, a
bachelor dinner is hereabouts! The average
Sydney bachelor is one of the most willing
absorbers of hospitality that is to be found any-
where. He will dine, lunch or sup with anyone
capable of putting eatable and drinkable goods
before him, yet the notion that it is up to him to
repay his hosts and hostesses in kind, from time
to time, never enters his predatory head. There
are scores of male free-feeders here, with never a
soul to pay for but themselves, who could not be
induced to do the right thing by their regular
entertainers with dynamite or a gun. They order
these things better in the United States, where the
young unmarried man is supposed to outlay a con-
siderable portion of his annual substance in
flowers, chocolates and books for the delectation
of those ladies who ask him to their houses, in
addition to buying the matrons and their families
a square meal and a theatre-box now and then.
If he resists, he is proclaimed a “mugwump” or
“ cinch,”, or something equally shameful, and
shortly after is refused the Glad Hand with
unanimity, and handed the Frigid Eye when he
least expects it.
To revert to the Hore-Ruthven ball. It pre-
sented the unusual feature, for a smallish affair of
200 persons or so, of numbering two V.C.-holders
among the dancers. The male guest was one, and
Major Maxwell, who is out here giving points to
the local warriors, the other. When in uniform,
and with all their decorations disposed about their
persons, these men of war are imposing spectacles.
Theydisplayabout apintofassorted medals apiece,
meandering across their chests, and countless
fragments of colored ribbon, significant enough
to army experts, doubtless; but to the mere
female hopelessly puzzling. Anyhow, one grasps
that each of these portions of metal or dry goods
is a landmark or milestone, recording some gory
affray, and it is easy, by their agency, to conjure
up the roar of the guns, the dying howl of the
enemy, and the pomp and glitter and horror of
battle generally. That is, it is easy, if one closes
one’s eyes and refrains firmly from gazing at the
dapper* good-natured and utterly, innocuous-look-
ingheroes who have lived among these grim things.
Their decorations suggest ghastly doings. Their
happy faces, their shiny and well-brushed heads
and immaculate clothes banish the theory that
they have ever viewed a deed of genuine violence
in their lives.
Mr. and Mrs. D’Arcv Osborne leave for a trip
to England via “ the East,” which is Australia’s
North, after the coming race festivities. Miss
Aline Ryrie accompanies them part of the way.
Two ancient Sydney mercantile families were
married in London just before the last mail left.
The bridegroom was Leslie G. Murnin, son of the
late G. F. Murnin, manager of the Australian
Widows’ Fund, and grandson of M. E. Murnin,
merchant and shipowner, and one of the first
directors ‘of the A.M.P. Society (1849-’GI and
1867-’6B). The bride was Miss Madge Broomfield,
a granddaughter of the late Captain Broomfield,
of Sydney. The usual “I wills” were said at
St. Peters, in Piccadilly.
Mrs. Harry Levy will make a stir presently
with a dance to signify her daughter’s entrance
into Vanity Fair.
There seems to be considerable mourning wear
amongst our Jewish nobility and gentry. It is
such elegant mourning, too ! Some one of impor-
tance in the tents of Israel has been gathered to
the upper front section of Abraham.
Australia’s old friend, “Better Not” Walling-
ton, is hard worked in his new billet as private
secretary to Queen Mary. The latest mails give,
in full, his eloquent effort conveying the royal
lady’s thanks for birthday wishes from the “Exe-
cutive Committee of the Walsall and District
Licensed Victuallers and Beer Retailers’ Friendly
and Protection Society.”
Mrs. Maclurcan and her youngest daughter
were departers by the Orvieto for a six months’
holiday. The lady haled a manager from foreign
parts to supervise the Wentworth in her absence.
Window-dressing is aspiring to the rank of a
fine art. Possibly in the near future or the middle
distance there will arise a window-dresser whose
work will gain him election as a Royal Academi-
cian, and there may be a Chair of Window-
dressing at the University. In Sydney, last week,
one big shop had a green and brown window.
Every shade of both colors was represented in
satin, ninons, voiles and every other fashion-
able material, draped to suggest how much
better they would look on a human form when
they appeared to such advantage on a steel
rod. Another window glowed with sunshades
in all the sweet-pea shades of color. And
yet another plate-glass (all belonging to the
same firm) was filled with men’s shirts, quite as
beautiful in the matter of coloring as the sun-
shades. One shirt in particular, a dull rose with
charcoal-black stripes, would suit a beautiful
Byronic young poet. A George-street firm has
had a golden window challenging the gold of
September for the last week. There are daffodil
shades in long lengths of charmeuse, primrose
chiffons and amber velvets, shades of orange such
as one sees in the underbody of the blue king-
fisher, and, posed in pride of place against the
golden background, one large black hat with
several black ostrich feathers and one big crinkled
yellow velvet poppy with a bud. This window
was probably a delicate compliment to the Wattle
Day inangurators. Their first festival, intended
to apotheosise the wattle for all time, was held on
Friday (September 1).
When Chief Justice Cullen rose to speak at the
Wattle Congress in the King’s Hall, it was soon
apparent that he hejd an unwilling brief for the
flower we had met to blither over. “ But, if you
must have a national flower,” he said, “then
wattle it be.” And the audience which had en-
dured Mr. B'otanifcal Garden Maiden’s floral
remarks for 36 minutes purred with joy of the
little joke. He made sarcastically merry over
the false gods who had taught that Australia’s
flowers had no perfume, its birds no song, and its
rivers no fish. Also, he had a fling at the poet
who drags the wattle by its roots into his
verse.
Besides the Chief Justice and Mr. Maiden, the
platform harbored Miss Rose Scott, Mr. J. D.
Fitzgerald, Mr. Lane Mullins, and other un-
known-to-me but capable-looking gentlemen. The
speaking was good, and that of the C.J. alone
deserved a crowded auditory instead of the
meagre attendance present. South Australian
wattle decorated and perfumed the hall, and The
Lone Hand for September, containing an illus-
trated wattle article and wattle verses, was on
sale and had numerous buyers.
There are many worse days than Wattle
Day—Vampire Day, Ash Wednesday, and
Judgment Day, for instance. Mrs. Kettlewell
(Miss Agnes Storrie) is hereby congratulated on
the success with which she has painted yellow
the first of September. As green must go with it
there cannot be any party strife. The Day com-
bines the 17th of March and 12th of July color-
ings.
The Church of England people have decided to
buy Greenoaks, on Darling Point-road, as a
residence for Archbishop Wright, who positively
wouldn’t live out at Bishopscourt, Randwick,
Greenoaks adjoins St. Mark’s Church, and was
the old home of T. S. Mort, described at one time
as “a princely residence—a mixture of the Gothic
and Elizabethan style of architecture, of most im-
posing appearance.” In Mr. Mort’s time it
housed a very valuable gallery of paintings ; but
the place has passed through several hands since
then.
Our long spell of perfect spring weather has
been the cause of a number of motoring tours
over what is now known as the Vice-Regal
Route. It begins and ends at Newcastle after
running through some 20 towns. The medical
Taylor Youngs and Mr. and Mrs. Shard are now
well on their honking way over that track. Some
friends of mine, just returned, report their death
roll for the journey as two hens, one dog, and a
sparrow. It is a swift motor that runs over a
sparrow and slays it in cold blood.
There’s an adorable garment for sale in a
George-street window —a man’s dressing-gown of
Paisley silk lined with old rose. It is only eight
guineas. I’ve been trying to think of a suitable
wearer, but cannot imagine anyone who com-
pletely fills the bill, save Petronius Arbiter of
Nero’s court. And he hasn’t been seen around
lately. Another likely candidate is Henry 111.,
the Painted Man of Valois. He is also missing.
All the suitable men appear to be missing. I
wonder how Peter Bowling would look in the
garment.
Buyers for vignettes of Australia at high noon,
Australia in the gloaming, Australia in seascape,
Australia with and without cattle in the paddocks,
and Australian men, women and children in oils,
water-colors, chalks and sculpture, have heen
fairly numerous at the Art Society’s show
in Vickery’s Buildings. Judges, or, as the
rejected call them, executioners, are yearly
growing more exacting, and naturally the ex-
hibition gains in quality while losing in quan-
tity. Mr. Watkins’s principal picture is named
“ The Doll.” It shows a handsome young woman
in bed. She wears a beautiful nightie, and lean-
ing towards her is a little girl who holds a doll.
A mirror is accessory to the picture, which is
winning a lot of admiration, especially from young
matrons. It has, besides, admirers amongst
persons who are Quite Good Judges, and who
have studied foreign galleries. Mr. Jackson’s
“ Maidenhood,” bought by the Gallery, represents
a spiritual-looking girl in a white garment
with mauvish pink reliefs. Miss E. Chap-
man shows a black-robed portrait labelled “My
Mother.” The artist must be very young to
have such a youthful mother. Mr. Salvana has
some pretty studies, and has had several buyers.
The buyer is a valuable animal but rare, and any
pastoralist who has a flock or herd of him grazing
on his property is invited to kindly notify the
fact. Also, information is wanted about wild
buyers running loose in the bush or building
their nests in trees now that spring is
with us. Dattilo-Rubbo, a big exhibitor,
shows some splendid old folks at home
and abroad. His “Breviary,” a gnarled, old,
brown-clad monk reading a thick little book,
is one of 'the Jew’s eyes of the ex. Mrs. Tom
Marshall’s “Mackerel Beach (Broken Bay)” is a
capital little study of a well-known beauty spot
or amateur fishing resort. The sunny patch of
sand, the hazy blue water, the little cottage
sentinelled by two yellowing poplars and the hump
of a green hill that compose the study are sympa-
thetically treated. Mr. A. J. Fischer’s “Old
Homestead Paddock ” was soon snapped up by
the rare animal previously mentioned. I like
Tristram’s “In the Half Light,” and if I wasn’t
afraid of being too original I’d say it shows
“ nice feeling.”
Three girls rage in the miniature section. They
have it to themselves. Miss Berenice Edwell’s
“ The Verger ” has been taken by the Gallery. I
don’t quite know what a verger is. Miss Lay-
cock’s is a cross between a priest and a conspirator.
Miss Gladys Laycock shows a miniature of Mrs.
Anderson Stuart, and Miss Justine Kong Sing is
represented by three that prove her a fastidious
artist and colorist. A handsome grey-bearded
party, labelled “ R. Campbell, of Bangalow,” and
with a lot of letters thundering after his name
and an order on his lapel, is one of the JuStine
girl’s efforts. A second is a smiling golden-
haired caprice entitled “Wife of Dr. Lohde,”and
the third is a delicate, dusky-looking study of a
girl wearing brown furs and a dull green motor
veil.
Miss Beatrice Day. and her co., also Mrs.
Carreno, were on the Warrimoo from the Bluff
to Hobart last trip. The liner got such an awful
buffeting that the great pianist and all the
theatricals except Miss Day were deadly sick and
wondered why the Lord made the sea. Miss
Day’s popularity in Maoriland is as wide and long
as the Boiling Island itself. She pretty well lived
in motors, and was being constantly entreated to
absorb elegant vittles.
Mrs. Georgina Delmar, whose soprano voice,
big, dark eyes and contagious cheerfulness won
Sydney’s rather chalky heart some two years ago,
returns here from Adelaide to sing in “ Carmen.”
She will be murdered for the first time on the
night of September 24. But, as there will be five
performances of the tragi-comedy, MrS. Delmar
will be slain on four subsequent occasions.
Mr. Walter Bentley brought forward a number
of sweet young things at the Shaksperian costume
recital at St. James’s Hall last week. Miss
Dorothy Cumming, a tall beauty of 16, was
Desdemona where she pleads Cassio’s case with
Othello. She did it so well that the audience
thought she would be equally successful in
managing a husband on the professional stage.
Miss Pauline Carr, in the opening scene of
“ Richard III.,” played up cleverly to Mr. Bent-
ley’s Richard. Miss D. Overend as Portia, and
Miss E. Mitchell as Nerissa, and Mr. R. A.
Jesson as Gratiano deserve a praiseworthy name-
mention. Mrs. Slapoffski made operatic music
between the acts, and the audience was a smart
and well-gowned assemblage.
The Woolley Pianoforte Scholarship for girl
students of this State, which in the matter of
capital amounts to £l2OO, is being contested for
the first time since its foundation. Eighteen girls
faced the music. They were reduced to four, and
a good one of the four was a daughter of Mrs.
Marie Narelle. Two girls from Ballarat have yet
to be tried, and then the judges—Mr. S. Haw-
ley and Mr. G. de English—will pick the winner.
“‘He’ roused suspicion,” says the London
correspondents, writing of the girl Ethel le Neve,
“by ‘his’ table manners. ‘He’ sipped ‘his’
coffee in a ladylike manner and ate fruit deli-
cately with two fingers.” Now, in the name of
Pomona, how many fingers does a man bring into
action when lie eats fruit ? Possibly he lifts it
between his two thumbs. Well, the next time
the Neve girl travels as a boy she will know
better. She will drink her coffee with a notable
snorting action, like a horse at a trough, and
when she eats she will put her foot on the food
and growl at the neighboring passengers. And
when she consumes soup she will make that large
generous noise (“ so-o-o-o-oop ”), from which, I
presume, the victual takes its name. Thus will
she escape suspicion.
A mere man lodges his protest : “ Those hand-
bags that women carry, clothed (the bags, not the
. women) in the outer remains of dead doggie, are
most disturbing articles of luggage. The other
day in a tramcar I found myself confronted by a
girl who was nursing a bag. The top-half was
leather, or what not, but the lower part showed
a dog's head and neck between a pair of
appealing fore-paws. It was gruesome enough
•as it lay in repose; but when the blessed
damosel raised the bag with one hand whilst
excitedly fossicking for a tram ticket with
the other, I felt my gorge rising to the occasion.
It seemed, for all the world, as though she had
stuck her fair young fingers into a live Fido, and
was trying to drag up his contents by the
roots. What with birds in their hats, minx s
faces and tails hanging round their necks,
and portions of dead dog on their hand-
bags, women are getting to be terrors to
male beholders. Are these latest novelties macie
in Australia or imported from the kennels of
Europe? I fear the former. Only the other day
there was a theatre matinee in aid of a Home for
Lost Dogs, so I guess that the scheme was to
gather the poor wandering ones to some factory,
where they are converted into sausages and hand-
bags. I don’t notice that poor dear pussy is
being slaughtered to complete Angelina’s outfit.
Cat doesn’t eat cat, does she ?”
This letter from a woman just fell into the post-
box :
Dorothea, our maid,has discovered a cheap dissipation
for herself. Every evening, after she has finished the
washing-up, she repairs to the newsagent’s, buys the
latest reports of the current horror, and bears them
swiftly home. Then she locks herself in her boudoir,
reads slowly and gloatingly to the bitter end, and retires
for the night with her nerves tuned up. About 2 a.m.
the household is awakened by shrieks and groans—Doro-
thea is having her twopenn’orth of nightmare. She is a
highly-strung girl who enjoys life to the full and does
everything thoroughly, and her nightmares are worthy
of her. The first night I thought the three old maids
next door were being murdered simultaneously by three
-Chinese gardeners. After more than a week of it, I have
become used to the racket, and refrain from getting up
and preparing for battle and sudden death. I hope that
color photography for newspapers doesn’t arrive for a
few years yet. When the Evening Bruise is able to give
a facsimile reproduction of the bloodstain on the stairs,
I am afraid we will have to manage without Dorothea.
Yours affectionately,
AKENEHI.

The display of Australian-made goods during
Show week in Melbourne was such as to make that young
rooster, Australian National Sentiment, crow with de-
light. And in the window-dressing competition at which
most of the leading firms went to the wicket, The Don,
Glenferrie.came out on top with arecord-breakingscore. It
competed in eight classes, and scored in all eight, including
three firsts, a batch of seconds and a couple of thirds.
In fact, it carried its bat with runs to throw away. ' Its
windows supplied intellectual fare as well as a feast of
splendor to the eye. In those devoted to hats, also those
to boots and to woollens, illustrations were on view of the
various processes the goods go through, from raw material
to finished article. Alongside a neat boxer was a rabbit
skin and a dish-like lump of felt, through which stages of
existence the s.tylish hat, although now too proud to
admit it, had once disported ; while the pretty boots
and shoes seemed to scornfully disown any re-
lationship to the kangaroo skin from which they had
sprung. Altogether, the Don window-dressing show pro-
vided a picturesque statement of Australia’s achievement
in the fine art of manufacturing garment’s,' bo (its,
hats, hosiery ana other sartorial delights for its glad
citizens of both sexes*

MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, September 5, 1910.
Mr Dear Yarrie,—
The Show has been the keynote, also the theme
and the fantasia of the week—the dusty, tiring,
interesting Show, to which 16,000 people go daily
with great avidity, and from which the whole
16,000 return caked with dust and dirt, and with
chaff and cinders in their 32,000 eyes. What is a
wealthy agricultural society thinking about?
Country people are always hospitable. Why not
reciprocate. The grounds are permanently there.
Can they not be turned into gardens round
the fringe? There is room. The live stock is
penned so that it couldn’t browse on the roses and
the geraniums. Years and years has that Show
ground been there —yet are there no trees
planted to shade the people who pay for its exist-
ence, and there is scarcely a seat in the whole
territory. Grass would be trampled up for
the week, but there is the year for it to recover in
—just as Flemington lawn is resuscitated after
the awful damage of race time. Instead of this
the beastly Powers have cinder paths.
On Thursday Governor Carmichael went out
with Secretary Victor Hood and Aide Captain
Vaux, and they prodded the gentle pig and the
woolly sheep, and asked how the wheels go round
in the clattering, clanking machinery. From the
stand they saw the water-jump, with other things.
The water-jump proved a free and unexpected bath
for some venturesome riders. Sunshine broke the
record for high jump, and was vain as a lady on
the parade afterwards. The girls who rode astride
made a goodly sight. Alice McCullagh, of the
woolly McCullagh clan, did some dashing jumps
with her habit cut on the straight.
Two Women’s Leagues had camps. Vida
Goldstein had one and Grace Watson the other.
The two clans don’t speak, so the tents faced each
other at. a safe distance, and the glares that
traversed the space made a good substitute for
wireless telegraphy.
Some keen Australians have a “ Bear ” trade-
mark. They planted saplings for the Show
time, and had half a dozen small live native bears
wandering in the branches. The bears felt the
cold, and snuggled up in their own fur and cir-
cumference with just two eyes gleaming out in
friendly fashion over each hard black flat nose.
There was nearly an accident at Spencer-
street on a crowded Show day ! The report says,
with charming and debonair casualness, that “ by
some mistake two trains were let in to the
same landing place at the same time.” The
Bendigo caravan had just dropped its cargo
of humans, when a train from the Show
came rolling in with 600 or so of passengers
aboard. The engine-driver was cool and quick,
and by the mercy of Providence the brakes acted,
and the passengers were only terrified by a fear-
some shrieking of whistles and grinding of brakes
and a rough and jarring stop. Yet, feven though
the brakes did all that was asked of them, the
Show-train engine was right up against the rear
carriage of the Bendigp train. Then, still pant-
. g, it was hurriedly backed and switched on to
another line, and the passengers thanked Chance
that they were not another string of items in the
long butcher’s bill.
The South Yarra Skating Rink carnivalled on
Thursday night—Show night. All the wild and
woolly holiday was got into that carnival. A
quite unrehearsed effect was arrived at between
numbers. The orchestra was getting ready fora
special number—someone intended to show off an
unusual figure B—but the skaters wouldn’t clear
the course, despite the clanging of the brazen
gong. A dozen boys began a game—they clung
to the rear drapery of each otherand sprinted top
speed over the field. The thing grew like a snow-
ball until all the skaters—some hundreds—
were in a long, whirling, unbroken line
like a daisy chain. They swirled and
twisted and doubled and tied themselves
into knots, but all followed the mad leader.
Assistants —worried and beautiful in their uni-
forms—were helpless. The orchestra joined the
majority, and broke into a mad two-step.
It was the finest carnival frivol anyone has
had, because it carnivalled for pure exhil-
aration, and the hundreds-fold line swept into
such wonderful forms and shapes. The “special
numbers ” got their turn in time, with the other
skaters sitting back breathless and beaming.
Mrs. Watt’s youngest girl skated a “ turn” with
expert Richardson, then skipped all round the rink
with a skipping-rope and her skates —a blithesome
flight. A four-year-old baby named Funstan, with
skates the size of sparrows on her baby boots,
gave a turn all on her own, then she drove a
successful team. It was like a tomtit driving
ostriches. Miss Watts had four sets of
lancers in hand each set in colored
dominoes and masks. It is comparatively
easy to skate a waltz, for there is the
glide to help you, but lancers are a different
proposition. The coaching must have been hair-
raising, but the effect was soft as down. The
usual carnival prizes helped along the originality
of the dressing. One lucky girl had her grand-
mother’s mother’s dress on. It was a brocade
covered with violets, the silk as thick as a blanket.
Violet fringe trimmed the quaint old shoulders
and sleeves. The dress was Unaltered since great
grandmother wore it, and great granddaughter
Molly Kerr slipped into the cast-off finery as if
she were built for it. Miss Nathan, a dashing
brunette, wore pink pages; of The Bulletin
(printed on bright pink satin) hung on to her
short white dress. An economical youth simply
wrapped himself in a week’s lot of his morning
Age.
There was an impromptu little party, for after-
noon tea, at Government House on Monday.
Tenor Kirby was to sing for Lady Carmichael, so
that charming lady sent hurried notes round
to about 40 Toorak ladies (the State Government
House is thereabout) and lovers of music, to listen
to his dulcet sweetness also. Freddie Beard-
played the accompaniments, and Victor Biisst
slapped the face of the vice-regal piano in
Lisztian rhapsody. It was just a nice spon-
taneous little tea-party, witli a special brand
of sweets laid on in the music. There was a
good deal of talk of the coming matinee in aid of
the City Newsboys’ Society. This is to happen
on Friday (October 14) at the King’s, and is in
lieu of the big ball that usually whirls brilliantly
for this cause. Lady Carmichael is putting her
back into it—she is boss of the society. Captain
Vaux, A.D.C., and Miss Onions are running the
thing. Tickets are going off well even now. They
have high hopes of a big house, as the event
happens on the day before the Caulfield Cup, and
Melbourne will be full. All the theatrical
managers are lending some of their people, and
the prettiest of the Arcadians will be on and off
the stage.
At the recent election of the she-committee of
the Foundling Hospital some cats had conspicuous
cards printed with the list of names. Through
two names was ruled a thick black mark. These
cards were sent everywhere by post on the
day before election. The cats even sent
copies to the two black-marked women them-
selves. The names of the printer and the sender
were both missing ; the budget was sent as “ paid
at Melbourne post office,” and the addresses
were type-written. One of the women thus
marked out has been 10 years on the committee,
and has worked like a Trojan’all that time. The
other is just as old a member, and is the daughter
of the doctor who practically created the Found-
lings’ Home. It was a catty thing to do. In
fact it wasn’t big enough to be catty; it was
mousey.
There were tearful farewellings among St.
Kilda suburbans last week. Miss Brodribb that
was, and Mrs. Johnstone that is, went off to join
her Captain-husband in the land from which we
get our imports of Ram Bux and chutney. Mr.
Fitzgerald Moore also left limply for India and
his regiment, leaving his brand new fiancee,
Aileen Shiels. He returns in 18 months for the
wedding. Then the Lawrences, mamma and
daughter, departed in haste to the other newly-
married daughter, who had cabled that she
couldn’t tolerate the aching home sickness unless
her Australian household came along and helped
her to enjoy London.
“Got away! Got away ! ” A wily old fox has
made off, tearing free through the paddocks. Yet
they could have sworn he was going to be caught.
The girl who was almost in at the death is weep-
ing salt tears, for his was the handsomest and most
expensive brush of the season. Anyhow, a har-
dier maiden has taken up the running, and is fly-
ing after that sleek Reynard’s heels. He is old
and clever—so there is still some betting on his
escape.
One of the Hammond-Clegg sisters—the Phyllis
one—is formally engaged, I hear, to Russell
Jones, youthful son of Jones, the lucky Broken
Hill investor and sport, who has devoted his
riches to England for years past. The boy has
been out here some time, and the Clegg maiden
of the flying Glaciarium feet is his rapturous ex-
perience in tender passion. Pa and ma Jones are
revisiting Australia shortly, and will be in Mel-
bourne for the Cup.
There was one thrilling item at the recent
artists’ dance that has hitherto gone unrecorded.
A forgetful young woman turned up without her
ticket. She asked for the secretary, who
materialised; and having established her well
and favorably known identity by reference to about
half a score of friends who were standinground, she
clamored for admittance. The secretary, con-
sidering presumably that the whole of these
perfectly reputable folk were conspiring to
take the artists down for one free ticket,
coldly refused the ticketless Peri leave to pass the
gate. He said abruptly that she should only do it
over his decomposed remains, or words to that
effect. The suppliant’s friends drifted inside to
complain of her evil plight, and just about then
she decided to buy a fresh ticket. With a spasm
of horror she realised that she had left her money
with her ticket. She was thus alone, broke, unable
to penetrate to where friends and money were,
and, to cap it all, miles from her happy Middle
Brighton home. The secretary noted her anguish
with a suspicious but otherwise unmoved eye, and
shortly after, surged inside to attend to his duties.
Then did a total stranger of the feminine persuasion
dash to the rescue and force gold upon the
forlorn damsel, whereby she was enabled to rail
and cab it home to where the ticket reposed, and
so back again in a downpour of rain, and triumph-
antly into the ballroom before 10 p.m. Far more
wondrous, in my view, than the unexpected
materialisation of a Good Samaritan lady-banker,
at a function of this sort, was the weird conduct of
the secretary. A knowledgable member of the
secretary tribe would have franked the lady in
with a rush, and saved the show he was connected
with much obloquy.
Miss Margaret Baskerville, who sculps better
than any other woman-body in Australia, is join-
ing in the fashion of Views. Her show will have
three days—September 8, 9 and 10 —at the Pines,
Wellington-street, Brighton. It will be worth
while even going as far as Brighton to see.
I saw Beatrice Day, just fresh from a Tas-
manian tour, bound for Caulfield and the races,
on Saturday. She is staying with Mrs. Forrest
out at Toorak. That clever little Maorilander,
Miss Laing-Meason, has been on tour with the
company, and attracting much notice.
Sunday (4th) was an important night in Mel-
bourne’s musical history, and the glad tidings are
going the rounds. The Vic. Professional Union-
ist Orchestra gave the first of a series of concerts
in Wirths’ rink, which had been fur-
nished with a few thousand seats and a few
hundredweight of sawdust on the slippery floor.
For the first time in their lives Melbourne’s
Sunday pleasure-seekers were invited, by a
modest advertisement, to come along and buy
tickets for a classical concert. They came
in sufficient number to fill most of the
seats ; also, there was a large demand for
standing room on payment of a silver coin.
Wirths’ skating rink, in the vicinity of Olympia,
is a.spacious building, with a high vaulted roof.
The voice of Lilian Reid, singing a couple ot inci-
dental “sacred” songs to a piano from a far-off
balcony, was not quite equal to - the anticipated
result of an encore. But the Orchestral numbers
delighted the audience, and, with the summer
coming on, Sunday promises to be a blessed day
of musical education for the crowd that never
dreams of going to the Town Hall on Saturday-
afternoons. The experimental concert started at
8 sharp, and lasted 70 minutes or so.
Pampari, one of the triolet stars of the opera
company, is engaged matrimonially to Zerga,
the small tenor of the two casts. They intend to
marry on Christmas day in Paris. They are both
in the Wrangle at Her Majesty’s. ' Because
Zerga had a stomach-ache, or indigestion in his
dignity or something, and was unable to play,
Pampari dramatically refused also, even to a
fracture of her opera engagement. Wherefore
hang more words and further horrible dissension.
The inevitable civil war has broken oht. - Who-
ever heard of Italian or German opera running
for more than a few weeks without getting a hot
box or something ? One principal is as sweet as a
spring lamb (but then he is getting most of the
pie and limelight), and another is tearing
his moustacliios in a frenzy at imaginary
things he calls slights. There is always
a prima donna to each tenor, and they
join factions, and feminine fur begins to
fly. Later on (usually when the musical
tourists reach the Maoriland period), the whole
company is in factions, and an unhappy manage-
ment holds up horrified hands and says:
“Sh-sh-sh-sh—for Heaven’ssake, sh-shush-slusli.”
But mostly it sh-sli-sh-es in vain ; for it is easier to
handle snakes in a basket than foreign musical
stars in a double-cast company. Williamson has,
luckily, the Voice and the sweet complacency of an
Amy Castles to fall back on if this rift within the
lute should widen, and Reg Roberts has been
brought back for an occasional starring ; so there
are, at any rate, two sane Australian props
(Roberts being by now acclimatised) to help sus-
tain a fabric that may get torn in the rampage.
One night last week, conductor Hazon shouted a
word of warning to the stage in almost apoplectic
fury—forgot, evidently, that it was not rehearsal.
The house was in the dark as to just what was the
trouble, but it soon busied itself guessing.
This is about the time when the Marshall Hall
orchestrians and alb patrons of the “only true
cult” are entertained bv Dr. Barrett at a mutual
admiration meeting. Therefore malicious people
are suggesting that the annual Barrettian recep-
tion should be fixed for the afternoon of Saturday
(17th), when the Professional Union Orchestra
gives its next concert in the Town Hall. All is
fair in musical love and civil warfare.
From “ Rosna,” Adelaide :
It. is to be feared that Arthur Adams did not carry any
unbounded admiration for the Literary Theatre hack to
Sydney with him. In fact, there were details in con-
nection with the performance of “The Wasters” calcu-
lated to make him tear his hair. A feeble curtain-raiser
preceded his play, thouirh the show was given in a sub-
urban hall, and the audience, numbering some 1200, had
cars and trains to think of. As a Result, half the people
kept up a procession doorwards iq the middle of the last
act. The rest stayed to the bittyr end, well after 11,
and mostly had to walk or cab homewards. The cast was
weak in spots—an avoidable evil, onp would think, recalling
the excellence of the past performances and the big range
of amateur talent that was once interested in the move-
ment. And, worst of all, some of the players committed
the unforgivable and cowardly crime of “improving”
the author’s lines—the misdeed for which Gilbert several
times threatened to assassinate mimes in cold blood.
That capable actor, Wilfred Neil, had to grapple with the
worries of stage-managment under these adverse circum-
stances ; but the most natural and scintillating piece of
acting in the whole play was achieved by Ivy Stacey.
Lady Bosanquet handed glittering cups to breath-
less but pleased athletes at the University Oval on
Friday, what time a nasty north wind sang in the
millinery of the assembled fair. The chief or main
champion of the afternoon was Henry Brose, a
brilliant youngster still in his teens. He is secretary
of the Sports Association, has an athletic record
reaching from here to the Northern Territory, a scholar-
ship list as long as a political argument, and is also a
more promising pianist than many who have gone career-
hunting in Europe. Which brilliant observation of my
own reminds me that fiddler Willie Cade has captured
an appointment as principal viola-player in Thomas
Beechain’s grand opera company now in London.
We are having a Memorial Oval at Hawthorne in honor
of our late good Premier, Tom Price. The thing is being-
fenced in by the people of the district and the deceased’s
friends and admirers generally, and every Saturday you
can see a great hole-digging and post-driving contest.
Those who don't want to wield their strong right arms in
the cause are at liberty to subscribe hole-digging money.
Muriel Craigie gave the memory of Shakspeare a
leg-up last Thursday night. She lectured the Shak-
speare Society on the subject of Juliet, her object being
to refute those who hurl clods at the charm and
humanity of the bard’s women. As a final clincher she
recited portions from the Romeo tragedy, whereafter the
society hurried home and shut its old opinions up in the
cellar or gave them to the dogs. It was quite willing to
take such a nice girl’s word for it.
The Pearces, of Glenelg, invited a herd of dancing
men and maids to a frolic at Glenelg Town Hall on the
30th. That edifice wore gala costume of yellow and gold
with mirrors marching in companies around it, and yellow
roses dancing quadrilles with asparagus fern overhead.
The hostess received near a wattle-clad stairway. She
was clad in olive-green embroidered lace, and was sup-
ported by a nice, blue-gowned eldest daughter. In the
ballroom at least five more bright young hostesses, in
assorted sizes and dainty frocks, were on hand to deal
out programmes, partners and other necessaries. With
the exception of Mrs. Fowler Stewart and Mrp. Luther
Scammell (in green charmeuse and lace straight from
Heaven or Brussels or somewhere), and one or Uvo more,
the guests were entirely of the young and joysome
fraternity—few even having reached the dour age of 25.
They included some pretty Tolley girls, jolly liptle Mary
Buchanan, a Wells daughter, pretty Miss Whfie, and a
few thousand extra.
The merry maids of Unle.v joined decorations and
fruit salads, and had an Apple Blossom dance the other
night; and the glad girls of Glenelg have announced
their hospitable intention of making September 16 a date
of considerable circumstance on a dull calendar. The
Junior Bachelors appropriated Bricknell’s and the 31st of
August for entertainment purposes. In fact, the craze for
that peculiar, but withal blithesome, hybrid, the com-
mittee dance, has grown to such an extent thqt we are
running out of titles and shall have to fall upon
politicians’ names, as they do in the geography;. So, if
you hear of the Homburg Hop, or the Butler Ball you
will understand.
Mr. and Mrs. Robert Cruickshnnk are providing another
joyous occasion for several hundred youngsters at the St.
Peters’ Town Hall on September 23.
Carreno, the wondrous artist and wondrously beautiful
woman, has been with us for a glad week. Her con-
certs were given at the Exhibition Building, a comfortless
barn, or barrack, or hayloft on the ground floor ; but the
audiences were of the kind that knew a Brahms sonata
from a coalscuttle every time, and you could have heard
a microbe sit down in the breathless stillness. The Synion
dame, the Ennises and all the Intellect were there, but the
ordinary frivolous peerage was mostly not.
Adelaide took kindly to Wattle Day, and wore the
golden bloom in its coat as one good Australian. Out at
M:\gill and other far suburbs where the horse-car still
ambles, the aged vehicles were even decked with it. But
the brand-new electric cars wore no yellow flora, lest in
their drunkenness they should be incited to climb lamp-
posts or execute a barn-dance in the public streets. Our
electric cars are still young and their spirits have to be
curbed. At some of the hills’ stations hordes of children
met the morning trains and forced great loads of bloom
on the passengers.
Parliament—an ill-used beastie that hasn’t many treats
—has gone off for a picnic to Oodnadatta. The ostensible
purpose of the visit is to see a man about a railway line.
Which reminds me, the Backblockers are in town in
shoals and great affluence for the Agricultural Show.
(You may have heard that the farmers in the Crow State*
have been planting wheat and reaping motor-cars for
some time past.) The house question, which has been
agitating Adelaide for months past, has developed into a
giddy problem out of Euclid, under this new strain, and
every loft, pantry, mouse-trap and ice-chest within miles
has been turned into an extra bedroom.
The Delprat family goes off to discover Europe early
next year.
Last week pretty Mabel Pearce, a relative of the
numerous Fotheringham clan, gave herself into the per-
manent keeping of Mr. Cato, an Apple Islander dwelling
in South Oss. The Voice breathed very quietly.
Sincerely yours,
JOHANNA.

Can only be had by Driving
the Rheumatic Poison from
the System.
o
The greatest trouble people have, who once
suffer from an attack of Rheumatism, is in pre-
venting a return of the attack. It comes back
year after year despite all the rubbing and ordi-
nary treatment they undergo.
This is because they do not drive the dregs of
the complaint, which is a poisonous acid in the
blood, from the system. No amount of blistering
or rubbing will do that—the trouble is in the
blood.
People who have tried Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills,
a blood-making medicine, find that their tonic
action not only eliminates the cause of rheumatism
from the system, but fortifies it against future
attacks. Drive the cause out with Dr. Williams’
Pink Pills, and reasonable care to keep the body
in a healthy condition will prevent a return of
the trouble. The following is an interesting
instance of how they cure
“After a severe attack of Influenza I was
attacked with Rheumatism and Sciatica,” said
Mrs. Caroline Ottesen, 26 Warner-street, The
Valley, Brisbane. “The left arm and shoulder
were first attacked. The agony was dreadful.
Sometimes the parts would be quite cold, and
then burning hot. I could not even hold a sauce-
pan. So great was the pain I would have to cry
with it. My fingers and wrists would knot and
swell up, so that the marks remain to this day.
The right shoulder was always free, but both legs
had throbbing pains in them. It caused me agony
to lift my left arm up. There was very little out-
ward sign, save some tiny veins showed reddish.
I was never free from Rheumatism. I never had
a moment’s rest except when I dropped off to
sleep ; but the pain would keep me awake for
hours. I would have to press my hands on my
legs or put a weight on them to get a little relief.
1 was recommended hot baths and liniments. I
tried both freely, but gave them up in despair. I
also had two attacks of sciatica in the left hip and
leg lasting about a week at a time. Quite help-
less I would be, and the pain would throb right
down to the big tOe. I would be attacked like a
shot, and have to be helped to my room and
rubbed to try and get a scrap of ease. At last a
lady friend told me about Dr. Williams’ Pink
Pills and I decided to give them a trial. Gradually
they set me right. The Sciatic and Rheumatic
pains slowly passed away, and my general health
improved wonderfully.”
Don’t let, any dealer talk you into taking some-
thing which he says is “just as good.” If you are
pestered to take a substitute, send 2s. fid. for one

POLITICAL
POINTS
Melbourne tramway employees have only
one explanation of the manager’s explanation of
the co.’s conduct in calling upon the men to sign
a petition against the establishment of a Wages
Board for their industry. They say it is Clapp-
trap.
N.S.W. Chief-Secretary Wood has started
his electoral campaign, and has already explained
away pretty nearly everything. One thing that he
hasn’t tackled yet, however, is the fact that he
stands for a Government which declared that
Wood’s electorate was too poor, horrible and de-
graded to be a fit site for an Australian capital.
Possibly he will have a look in at that topic later
on.
Senator McGregor, in moving the second
reading of the Australian Notes Bill, assured the
House that there was “ nothing dangerous or
alarming” about it. It seems rather an optimistic
view. In its original form the Bill provided that
anybody who cashed a £25 cheque could demand
to be paid in any one of five denominations of
notes, which-meant that it was necessary to have
£ll5 worth of notes on hand in order to be able
to meet all possible legal demands on one £25
cheque. Then, this being pointed out, the
Government rushed to the other extreme, and
now nobody can demand Government notes at all,
and the banks need not buy any of them ; or if
they do buy them they can, should they feel that
way, return the whole lot any minute and demand
their gold back. In these circumstances,
McGregor’s optimism seems rather misplaced.
On June 30, 1909, Ohinemuri (M.L.)
locked up its liquor bars under the No License
vote of 1908, and on July 1 the cutter Wholesale
Jag commenced a service between the home
port and the nearest brewery or spirit wharf.
The cargo manifest for the first 12 months was
issued a few days ago. It comprised 33,658
gallons of wet goods, of which 30,496 gallons were
beer and 2561 whisky. That leaves 600 gallons
unspecified, and they’ll have to go at that.
Alf Lumsden, who was beaten again at
Kooyong (Melb.), in the by-election for the House
of Reps., has probably scored a larger number of
unavailing votes than any other luckless candi-
date for that Chamber. He polled heavily in the
past against Frank Madden for the State Assem-
bly. Then, for the Reps., his Kooyong figures
were 11,777 last April, when Knox beat him by
3000 odd, and 8214 last week, when “Bob” Best
beat him by 3000 odd. It seems up to Lumsden’s
supporters to present him with a testimonial in
consideration of his glorious defeats.
A SIMPLE PROBLEM.
“We have been told that between eight and nine o’clock on the Monday morning there were between 2000
and 3000 movements of bells or levers for which the South Yarra signalman is responsible?”—“Yes.”
“And lie had 37 trains to attend to in the time? ”—“I understand the book shows it.”
—Richmond (Vic.) Railway Accident Inquiry.
After all. it is only a question of getting the right kind of signalmen.
Vie. M.L.A. Beazley, who has just re-
turned from a visit to Japan, comes back filled
with information and breathing earnest warnings.
There is no time to lose, he says :
Japan is growing perceptibly ; the Japs are preparing
in every direction and are eager for fight. . . . China's
ambitions are increasing daily, and there is no knowing
where they will stop.
Because of the urgency of the case, Beazley
recommends the Federal Parliament to go in for
the Brennan mono-rail for the transcontinental
lines. It would lessen the cost, which is im-
portant, and hasten the construction, which is
still more important.
The British Government being in sore
need of more revenue, and yet solid on the Cob-
denite superstition against taxing the
importer, lately added a few dozen
to the hundreds of petty imposts
that already madden the British
taxpayer, partly because of their
weight, and partly because they are
so numerous that it is impossible to
remember them all. So Freetrader
Bull is having a great time. A
landowner with 723 acres —just a
little more than a cockv’s
selection—had recently to
write answers to 1200 ques-
tions before his tax could be
assessed. Presumably there
were about 40 different small
ways in which he was liable to
be taxed, and 39 points on
which he was entitled to
rebates and deductions, that
being the regular British way
of doing things. Then the
owner of a burial plot in a
cemetery was called upon to
state the value of the “un-
developed minerals” in his
land. One of the many things
which go to promote the hap-
piness of Bull, these days, is
this same tax on the sup-
posed value of minerals alleged
to exist underground but
not opened up. Nothing
makes Bull feel gladder on
the surface of the earth
than to be asked how much
coal there is under his
property, and if there is tin
600 ft. down.
A casual extract from the
“Trade and Finance ” column
of the Sydney Telegraph one day last week
If the Federal Government would definitely interest
themselves in the break of gauge question it would un-
doubtedly be to the lasting gain of Australia, if they
could effect its removal. All who have studied the
question admit that the New South Wales standard
gauge (4ft. BJin.) is the right one to adopt.
As a matter of fact, those who have really studied
the question don’t admit anything of the sort.
They have heard, which the absurd Telegraph
apparently hasn’t, of Brennan’s mono-rail and
gyroscope, and of the possibilities of travel on a
single rail at 120 to 150 miles per hour over grades
and round curves that the old style of railway
•won’t look at, and they are hustling after more
information. It is a pity the poor old Telegraph
hasn’t heard of the mono-rail.
English papers, politicians and merchants
are making a pathetic to-do over the “blank
ingratitude” of Japan as manifested in the new
tariff of the stunted brownish man. “Thefirmest
and most devoted friend gets the worst treat-
ment,” wails the Daily Mail. Well, what did
the “devoted friend” expect? Tariff dealing
between nations is a matter of give and take, and
J. Bull, having left himself nothing to give, be-
cause he has given everything already, is bellow-
ing over Japanese ingratitude because the small
brownie will not allow him to take anything
worth mentioning. In fact. Bull, Esq., persistent
Freetrader, stubbornly and for righteousness’
sake refusing to protect himself, is utterly dis-
gusted because Japan will not protect him by
extending certain commercial privileges. Pro-
bably this experience will serve to satisfy Bull
that Heaven protects those who protect them-
selves.
It is often difficult to tell whether it is
sheer blighted ignorance that is the matter with
the Tory person or whether he departs from the
truth because he is built that way. Consider this
sample, for instance, from last week’s debate on
the Defence Bill
Senator St. Ledger (Liberal, Queensland) pointed out
that Australia was the first British-speaking country to
adopt a qualified form of compulsory service. America
bad steadfastly refused to have anything to do with it.
Possibly Sledger didn’t know that England has a
compulsory service law, though it hasn’t been en-
forced during recent years, and that a similar law
exists now in the Channel Islands, Cape Colony.
Canada, and various other places in the British
Empire. Possibly he did know, but just manu-
factured his evidence as he went along. You can
never tell where the Tory is concerned.

When you have an accumulation of cases, as in this
instance, and when you find that the maximum fine pre-

of justice. —Premier Wade (N.S.W.) trying to justify

From Hansard :
Mr. Archibald : It [the Cable Association] is a business
monopoly.
Mr. Batchelor: And like all monopolies
Mr. Bruce Smith : It- is not a monopoly, because other
newspapers may combine and have an arrangement of
their own.
Mr. Batchelor: Of course they may; but while it is
not a technical monopoly, it is, as a matter of fact, an
absolute monopoly. What is the use of the honorable
member for Parkes sticking his head in the sand?
Mr. Bruce Smith : It is a practical monopoly.
And thus are the newspapers which run the cable
combine given right away by one whom they
have nourished in their bosoms!
“Two Seas ” on a N.S.W. land matter :
Keep your eye on the trafficking in closer-settlement
farms. The Minister for Lands explains that the few
original holders of Peel River blocks, who have trans-
ferred to buyers, either lost money on the deals or made
a profit of a bumble fiver only. But doesn’t Sammy Moore
know that agents are circularising holders of “non-
transferable ” closer-settlement farms with the informa-
tion that transfers can be Obtained if the matter is “ care-
fully handled ” by those same agents? Doesn’t he know
that the same agents are sending out lists to probable
buyers giving particulars of several farms in which the
price of the “ tenant’s interest ” is fixed at anything up
to £1000? Doesn’t the innocent Samuel know that it is
quite possible for the original holder to make a declara-
tion that, “owing to circumstances,” etc., he is sell-
ing out bis non-transferable farm for the bare amount
of his instalments, plus his rough improvements, and
then sell to the buyer a pair of old hens and a lame
sheep-dog for £1000? If he doesn’t, and he accepts the
fatuous explanations offered by his officers, then all that
may be said is that Samuel is too green for his job.
A week or two ago The Bulletin had
occasion to quote a surprising cleric who orated
in this wise before the Peace Society in Sydney
Mr. Rivett made a comparison between the black
races and the white people in the matter of race suicide.
Among the dark nations no premiums were necessary to
give any impetus to the birth-rate.
Now the statistics for 1909 are out, and they show
that, among those countries which are sufficiently
civilised to keep records, Australia has the very
best birth-rate bar three (increase by excess of
births over deaths, 15i per 1000 per annum).
And the three countries that beat it—Russia,
Bulgaria and Servia—-are all white men’s coun-
tries. Yet pro-nigger parsons will probably
trot out the old slander as gaily as ever at the
next opportunity. Their class rises above all
the ordinary rules of accuracy and fairplay.
Sometimes after reading the wondrous inven-
tions of the sensational cleric—his manufactured
statistics, and sham evidences, and garbled his-
tory—this paper has felt inclined to otter £lOO
prize for the best essay on the question “Are
Parson? Human ?” It is a large subject and calls
for investigation.

A SIMPLE PRESCRIPTION.
Said to Cure Rheumatism, Kidney Trouble and
Bladder Troubles.
We know that the readers of this paper appre-
ciate good advice, and we are glad, therefore, to
be able to publish the following from a prominent
physician.
It is astonishing to know the prevalence of
kidney trouble and other diseases, such as rheu-
matism, bladder and liver troubles, which are
almost invariably caused by weak kidneys. It is
said on good authority that fully one-third of the
people in Australia who have reached the age of
maturity are more or less afflicted with kidney
trouble in some form. The most dangerous feature
of this disease is the fact that many people have it
without their knowledge, and consequently neglect
it until it has reached a dangerous stage.
The least symptom of kidney trouble, such as
backache, must be given prompt attention, and a
good reliable treatment should be taken, until
every trace of the disease has been eliminated.
We are glad to be able to give our readers a
prescription which we have seldom know to fail
in any case. ,It contains no harmful ingredients,
is pleasant to take, not expensive, and can be
supplied by any good chemist. It is as follows :
Tincture Gentian Compound, one ounce; Syrup
Rhubarb, one ounce ; Liquid Barkola Compound,
one ounce ; Syrup of Ginger, five ounces.
Take a teaspoonful after each meal, and one at
bedtime.
We are glad to publish this prescription, as we
know it will help our afflicted readers who give it
a fair trial. If taken continuously for a few
weeks, it will be found to be an almost absolutely
certain cilre for rheumatism, kidney and bladder
trouble, backache and all allied complaints.

NOTIONS
Drexel’s 6750 ft. dive into the clouds is beaten
already by one Morane, a Frenchman, who soared 8469 ft.
Drexei turned back when his motor began to spit, but
the frozen Morane pushed on, forcing the thing to the
last gasp, and only when he seemed to swim along
horizontally did he turn back to earth. At 7500 ft. on the
return trip the struggling motor stopped, and Mor ine
started for earth at a fearful speed. Altering the incline
of his wings he swirled round and round, using gravita-
tion as his driving power while he strove to restart the
engine. But it wouldn’t even snort, and all the while the
speed was increasing. His brain reeling and sick
from the velocity Morane, with numbed hands, altered
his incline again, and suddenly found himself shoot-
ing through air funnels. The monoplane was caught in
the eddies and tossed about like a ship in a gale, and the
air-rider found himself repeatedly on the point of being
capsized. But he stuck to it grimly, doing all he could
to keep his balance, and at last recovered control. He
reached the earth safely, and was found in a sitting pos-
ture, dazed and mumbling, but otherwise unhurt. Ex-
actly how long it took Morane didn’t know, and the
whole thing seems to have been like a dream that spread
over about 10 terrible centuries. The very figures look
horrible. Just fancy coasting round the earth, 8469 ft.
(over 1J miles) away from the surface, on a trumpery
little thing of metal, wood and sheeting, shaped like a
bird and measuring about 35ft. from tip to tip. Ugh !
* * * *
These great soaring feats have all been accom-
plished on monoplanes. The bi-plane appears to have prac-
tically dropped out of the race. The triumph of the French
model is complete, and the Yankee notion drops into
second place. The Wrights are rarely heard of these
days, and their dangerous type of machine is being con-
siderably modified. The Frenchmen who tackled the
aviation problem were scientists and proceeded on scientific
methods, aiming for a definite object at each step. The
Yankees were brave men, but being mere mechanics, they
made a number of empirical experiments just to see what
would happen, and eventually evolved, by accident, a
flying lfiaohine that happened to fly. Since then the
Wrights and their implement have improved immensely,
and the groping mechanics of a few years ago are now
engineers. But their trouble is that the others have got
a big start, and they are more or less committed to
the crude contraption of their unenlightened days.
Meanwhile another school is arising which threatens
to eclipse both monoplane and biplane as they are at
present, and to produce a real aerial yacht which will
carry passengers and a certain quantity of cargo. But
even the present day machine is being developed as a
weight-carrier, and quite a number of passengers have
been taken on board by various reckless fliers. The
latest to do the passenger trick was a woman, Mrs.
Helene Dutrieu, who travelled about 20 miles at an alti-
tude of 1250 ft. with a paying guest. It was a daring feat
for the lady, but the lodger was a hero all right.
* * * *
Gosh, how it does move ! Breguet, the French
aviator, has flown round Lille, in N.W. France,With five
passengers in an aeroplane; and not killed or even
broken one of them. But more fearful and wonderful
still is the fact that the French Aero League is offering
inducements for the establishment of an aeroplane ser-
vice to carry passengers across the English Channel be-
tween Boulogne and Folkestone. One might imagine
that there would be some difficulty about obtaining a
permit or license under such conditions, for the butchery
of the fliers is still going on merrily. Another question
that will have to be answered, shortly', is : How far up
does the jurisdiction of a Government extend ? Is it up
to the three-mile limit, or up as far as the atmosphere
extends, or up to the point at which the man or other
intelligent animal on the nearest inhabited sphere serves
notice to quit and bangs out the sign “Visitors will
please keep off Space ? ”

The chances of Newtown in the Sydney Metro-
politan Rugby Union competition are distinctly rosy
after Saturday’s games. Newtown’s bugbear was South
Sydney, and Saturday, when it had to meet the same,
was an anxious day. The omen was a bad one for New-
town, as South won the toss and started out to make hay
while the wind blew- in its direction. With a sudden rush
Newtown carried the game right into the Southerners’2s,
but the full-back booted it over their heads, and his for-
wards swept it right across the Newtown line. Disdain-
ing to force, Collier, of Newtown, kicked across the field,
when the ball was once more booted over the Newtown
line, and a man from the South dashed in and scored.
All the same, it would have been better play to have
forced. Fortunately for Newtown, the kick failed. A few
minutes later the line was again crossed, but the
ball was brought back by the referee. Then Newtown
got into the soup, and being penalised right in
front of its posts, South kicked an easy goal.
Elated by the lead of six to nil, South went roaring down
to finish its work, and raged along the Newtown line.
But Newtown was all out, and the team fought like 15
fiends, hurling South back again and again till a Newtown
three-quarter managed to kick clear. The Newtown for-
wards carried it over the half-way line, where the South
goalkeeper essayed to send them back to the Newtown
line. But the kick was blocked, and Newton fell on the
leather and scored. The kick failed, so the first half
ended with South leading by six to three. South opened
the second half with a mag-nificent charge, which reached
the line only to be blocked. Then Newtown dribbled it
clear, let loose the machine and reached the
Souths’ line. Another wild-cat struggle on the line
was ended by' the Souths dribbling clear. A
mark stopped them, and Newtown settled down
to a series of charges which drove the crowd
of 1500 wild with excitement. At last the line
was crossed ; but again the kick failed, and the sides
were equal with six each. After that it was a heavy'
struggle, with narrow escapes for both sides. Dunbar,
the Newtown full-back, played a Trojan game, and saved
his side frequently with his splendid kicking. Neither
side succeeded in scoring again, and the game ended in
a draw with six points each. The other match of the A
Division ended in a victory for Glebe, which utterly
routed University'by'l7 points to eight. Next Saturday
Newtown will meet University’, and Glebe will struggle
with South Sydney. That Newtown will devastate Uni-
versity is almost a certainty, but in the Glebe-South
Sydney match anything may happen. If Glebe
knocks the skull of South against the wall
Newtown will win the premiership without a final. But
if South downs Glebe, as it is almost certain to do, any-
thing may happen. To make a fine exciting finish all
that is required is for University’to down Newtown and
South to beat Glebe. At present Newtown leads with 23
points, South has 21, and University and Glebe are level
with 18 each.
In the B Division Manly beat Sydney by eight
points to six, North Sydney crushed Balmain by 17 to
six, and Eastern Suburbs made a holy show of Western
Suburbs by 22 points to eight.
* * * *
TheN.S.W. Rugby League Competition ends
on Saturday week, the 17th, and, on present showing, the
premiership lies between Newtown and South Sydney.
Newtown is in front with 21 points, and South
Sydney is second with 20. Eastern Suburbs has 18 and
Balmain and Glebe have 16 each. Annandalehasll. On
Saturday Newtown rolled up Western Suburbs by 34
points to six, and South downed Glebe by 22 points to
two. Annandale, after some little unpleasantness, which
was promptly suppressed by the referee, beat North
Sydney by eight points to nil. The horrible example of
the day was the way Eastern Suburbs stood on the ear of
Balmain, which was defeated by 39 points to two.

Brisbane had a dust-up on the football field.
As a rule, when violence breaks out on thereabouts
one of the teams is connected in some way with a
church, and Brisbane’s Saturday upheaval was no ex-
ception. The Christian Brothers were playing South
Brisbane. The low seems to have started with a South
man trying to kick a Christian Brother and missing ;
then pandemonium broke loose, and there was something
like a free fight. Just here, the referee discreetly retired
from the field, and when the scrappers sorted themselves
out they found the game was over.
A Christchurch (M.L.)football team is fondling
a mighty record for the present season. In 15 matches
the team scored 276 points, and not' a point was
notched against it. The record suggests that the team’s
barrackers must have guarded the goal-posts strenu-
ously, or that the full-back was armed with a gatling-
gun.
* * * *
Saturday’s football in Melbourne was untidy
and ill-regulated. The weather was unspeakable, and
though the only two games that really mattered panned
out as was meet and proper, the others mostly exhibited
the “surprising reversal.” that Patrick Galilee loves.
South had to beat ’Roy to get in the final four, wherefore
it labored heavily. ’Roy being equally willing, a ructious
discussion ensued, and two of the Maroons were soon
carried off helpless. At half-time the board remarked—
South 23 points, ’Roy 21. Spectators then promised
themselves a gaudy finish. But ’Roy began to
feel the loss of its battered men, and steadily
fell back. Then a cold, driving rain soaked into
the shelterless crowd, and its enthusiasm oozed
out of its boots. Most of it assumed South’s suc-
cess, and it guessed right, for the end was—South, 52
points; ’Roy, 29. Out at Victoria Park Geelong could
make no headway against Collingwood, which led
throughout and won with 37 points to 21. That con-
cluded Geelong’s bogging-in for the season ; ( but
as it has pushed itself from second-last to within
an ace of the select four, there are hopes for
it next year. ’Tis an earnest, deserving team.
The other scuffles were improper enough. The humorous
Melbourne 18 capsized ’Varsity by 60 points to 49 ; Rich-
mond upended Essendon by 51 points to 50 ; and the
despised Saints celebrated the end of their toils by drub-
bing the mighty Carlton. It was a feat that will stand a
ton of explanation: Carlton, two goals 12 behinds ; St.
Kilda, five goals six behinds. Possibly the Old Blues
were all wearing new boots so as to break them in for the
finals. “ Boots ” appear in the balance-sheets with great
regularity ; so presumably the ’bailers do indulge in a
new pair occasionally. Next Saturday the beginning of
the end arrives with a collision between Carlton and
South. ’Wood plays Essendon the following week, and
after that the matter reaches a conclusion in the custom-
ary manner.
The “final four” in the Ass. being already
fixed, the disturbances mattered little. Only one—
North v. Essendon —was interesting as a preliminary
c inter. North went down by 29 points to ’Don’s 52, but
there is a misty suspicion that it wasn’t wasting breath
and muscle on a scuffle that made no difference. In the
semi-final it collides with Brunswick, and it won’t be the
same North then. ’Wick casually put together 59 to
Brighton’s 28, and P’ran heaped up a break of 173 against
Preston’s 27. The other collisions are best forgotten.
Preston, without a solitary win during the season, now
retires from public life. Still, even Preston hasn’t
equalled the record of the Essendon Juniors, who filled
in the afternoon at Fitzroy yyithput apparently getting a'
kick at the ball. The scorer’s report of that burlesque
was: ’Roy Juniors, 23 goals 21 behinds; Essendon
Juniors, 0.

Victorian football is threatened with a new
horror. At a match between Broadford and Euroa the
other Saturday an old-man cockatoo put in an appear-
ance among the barrackers, and shrieked profanity at the
contending elements. Bull-roarers and small mega-
phones already utilised" by. enthusiastic sup-
porters of :the .game, but the infuriated fowl is an
original sin. In South Melbourne, it is said, the dogs
bark furiously at the sight of a Carlton uniform, but
hitherto the poultry has preserved a neutral attitude. If
cockatoos are utilised as a regular thing to swell the
clamor at football matches, Gabriel will have to select
some other day than Saturday for blowing his trumpet
call.if he hopes to make himself heard! in Melbourne.

The.annual Bathurst-to-Sydney road cycle race
was held on Saturday last and resulted in a win for F. L.
Foxover, who started from the 41min. time mark. Sixty
breasted the tape, but the strong head wind and the hor-
rible height of Mount Victoria-weeded them out to 34,
who completed the run. The winner, who rode Dunlops,
streaked over the. 133 J miles in Bhr. 2min. 19sec. The
fastest time was made by F. D. Wallcott off scratch ; he
ran through in 7hr. 38min. I7see. T. Larcombe, the
N.S. W. road champion, did not start; and four of the five
Victorians who did might have saved themselves the
trouble, as only one (F. Walsh) finished the run. The
way the long-markers have been scooping in the prizes of
late suggests that the starts will have to be still further
reduced.
* * * *
As the result of investigation, T. Doyle, who
last week won the Viotorian Cycle Traders’ 100-miles
Road Race in such a remarkable manner, has been dis-
placed. The officials say they are not satisfied that
Doyle covered the full distance of the course. The first
prize goes therefore to G. T. Mackrodt, who finished
second, and the other prize-winners move up one place
each.

' That baseball in Australia hasn’t a “ possible ”
against football was shown by the attendance at the
inter-State carnival, begun at Richmond (Vic.), on Satur-
day. Only a poor 300 enthusiasts cheered the players.
The entertainment started with N. S. Wales v. Vic., but
Ma’s efforts were hopeless, the tally at the finish being
eight against--two. The Vic. battery (Scott and
Allan) was distinctly superior to that from Wade’s
State, though pitcher Antill has little to learn from
anybody. An even worse disaster overtook Tasmania.
The Islanders made a most feeble show against South
Oss, and scored only ohe run to the others’ 17. The rest
of the eight games arranged for happen along till Satur-
day, \vhen the carnival will doubtless terminate in the
presence of a small but select assemblage.

Sydney baseball came to its tether-end on
Saturday when Petersham heaped gall and wormwood
on Burwood (premiers for the season), defeating them
by 17 runs to “ nary a one.” The Burwood band had,
early in the season, demoralised all opposition ; but the
recent defeats have caused it to be thankful for its early
successes. The event of Saturday hung’ an awful tomb-
stone about the neck of the season’s champion team just
at the closing of the season’s shutters.

Sydney lacrosse premiership came to an un-
gainly end on Saturday in a rather too strenuous game
at Manly, where Petersham (challengers) defeated Sydney
by seven goals to four. The game was rough, and the
“stick’’was rather too often biffed hard on the oppo-
nents’ head in preference to the ball. Towards the end
of the game the Law, in the shape of a policeman,
bundled two players off the field ; and it would have been
for the glory of the game if many other players had been
booted off. The result of the premiership was hard luck
for the Sydney team, which vanquished Petersham in the
semi-final and gathered in the final by defeating Mosman,
only to be licked by Petersham in the challenge round.

The start of the racing season can always bfe
depended upon to bring to the limelight the alleged
philanthropy of the Australian Jockey Club. This year,
the A.J.C. has almost run riot, and the generosity pro-
posed is wonderful. Hitherto, if there was one thing the
A.J.C. prided itself upon it was originality. Last year, as
the result of bulging coffers, the added money was pushed
high enough to make the other State./clubs blink. That
was an alleged effort at originality. This.year, however, the
A.J.C. has come off the high gee-gee and decided to
follow the V.R.C. in recognising that there are under-
sized horses on the face of the State ; and in future prads
under 14.2 hands will be registered as alive —though
they are at times “dead.” All disqualifications for past
transgressions at unregistered meetings are wiped out;
and great and small gee-gees, dukes, earls and plain
Jones and Brown are now on the one footing.
“Vulcan”: She’s come—Rebecca Mo! At a
recent Sandown Park (Eng.) meeting, punters momen-
tarily lost interest in the “ dead cert.” at sight of a she-
penciller crying the odds with the best of them. The
lady is described as a dainty, Dresden-china person, with
grey-tinged hair, and is said to be a one-time theatrical
star who married a well-known British sport, now dead.
She carried a toy “book” in sumptuous binding, and was
shepherded by a portly she-scout, who chased the odds
in orthodox style.

S. Aus., which hasn’t had a really good horse
for years, is beginning to think it has struck one. In
the Fulham Park Plate, the first two-year-old race of the
new season in Adelaide, Arya (Aryan—Yelk) won easily
from a field of 25. The next Saturday he gave them all
from ist. to ljst. and won again. Each time the only
thing that got anywhere near was Sir Vincent (St.i
Vincent—Golden Fleece), belonging to the same owner,
A. Nicholson. The Register says Nicholson offered them
both, and their dams,, with foals at foot, for £3OO the lot
a few weeks ago. Racing is booming' in S.A. This two-
days meeting of the Adelaide R.O. put nearly £31,000
through the totalisator, a £5OOO increase on last year,
and more than double the figures for any year from 1904
to 1907. The club’s commission nearly pays the stakes
given, £2650. Meanwhile the public got fine returns
from the machine. The first day £6 ss. was the
lowest, in seven races, and £l6 or £l3 was a fre-
quent figure. In similar circumstances, Ikey McMo
would give “10 to 1 the field.” The second day
returned one 18-guinea dividend. And this despite the
fact that the second horse also pays a dividend. Mostly,
well-fancied ones ran second, returning one-pound-
something for a sovereign (which is better than losing);
but in one field of 14 the dividends were £9 10s. and
£7 135., and in a field of 15 they were £6 4s. the first and
£l7 ss. the second (which is much better than losing).

The evergreen Roberts, playing a series of short
games with Lindrum at Alcock’s-RoomsfMelbourne) suc-
ceeded in his first attempt to give the young ’un 1000 in
6000, but he had only 100 or so to spare at. the finish.
With Lindrum in his best form the handicap is in his
favor, but on his play last week the young champion was
not unlucky to lose. Roberts played a beautiful buoyant
game, as a rule.

The news that Frank Gotch has “retired” is a
humorous item. Gotch called himself champion heavy-
weight wrestler of the world because Hackenschmidt de-
clined to continue in the face of the disgraceful wild-cat
tactics the Yankee resorted to, such as toe-breaking and
eye-gouging. When Hacky asked for another match in
England, or anywhere save in the U.S.A., Gotch at first
declined, but eventually he was understood to have
signed a contract to medt the Russian in Australia. If he
ever made such a contract he broke it. Now a formid-
able brown man is looking for a match, and Gotch gets
out quickly. Gotch appears to be a typical Yankee
champion.

As time goes on, people are getting a wider
view of the tragedy of Reno, and are also speaking more
freely. It is now generally assumed that it Was sheer
unalidyed funk that made Jeffries such an eaffy snap for
Johnson. Had Jeffries not been afraid Johnson might
have won just the same, but he would not have won so
easily. Jeffries, it seems, has always been a nervous
man before a fight, and was usually taken to the
ring in a state bordering on collapse. But in
those days he used to recover himself almost
immediately he got inside the ropes. Further, he was
always up against men who were as nervqus as himself,
or even worse. This time he did not recover his nerve
immediately he ente'red the ring, and, moreover, he was
up against a man who wasn’t nervous. And before
Jefjfries could revive he realised he had met some-
thing [stronger and more formidable than ever in his
life before. Then he just went to pieces, and was slugged
out in a dazed condition, the latest victim of blue funk,

If the people who run boxing matches wish to
avoid the wrath of The Jud they will have to take
effectual steps to ensure that only men who are
thoroughly well shall enter the ring. At Ballarat, on
Saturday night, “ Soldier” Rogers fought Copperwaite
for 18 full rounds, and was knocked out in the 19th. He
had all the worst of the scrap, but did not appear to re-
ceive punishment in any way out of the ordinary.
Various paper correspondents described the contest as
“ brutal ”; but it does not seem to have been in it
with the scraps that are usually put up in. the
athletic meetings of- members of mutual improvement
societies. But, after being floore,d in the 19th round,
Rogers was carried off to the hospital, and died just as
the door was reached.. Death, it was found, was due to
haemorrhage of the brain. From the descriptions of the
contest it is fairly evident that either Rogers was not in
condition to stand the strain of such a contest, or was in
an unhealthy state, which should have debarred him
from entering the ring at all. He was only 24 years
of a S e ’ ,
There has been an appalling lot of the most
nauseating snuffle talked and written in England and
America over the Johnson-Jeffries calamity'. “What,”
asked a writer drearily in a recent issue of London
Times, “ would the grim, gaunt hero of the old prize-ring
have thought of Monday’s glove fight at Reno, among the
steep silver-bearing hills of Nevada? . . . He would not
be very well pleased at hearing that women were allowed
at the ringside. He would describe the conduct of the
members of the ‘divorce colon}'’ at Reno in vigorous
Shakspearian terms, the language of an elder morality.
But what would awake in him abysmgl disgust, a nausea
of the very soul, would be the news that spectators of the
black-and-white battle were searched for revolvers, soda-
water bottles, and so forth—weapons which might con-
ceivably be used by disappointed partisans in danger of
losing their dirty bets for maiming one or other of the
fighters. He would be glad to remember that it has
never been, nor ever will he, necessary to take such pre-
captions for securing the prehistoric rudiments of fair
plqy in the mother country of the not ignoble art
of self-defence.” As| a matter of fact, the idea of
searching the Reno crowd for bottles was conceived
owing to a remembrance, by old-time English p.r.
patrons, of the Smith-Slavin disturbance. Certainly
this notorious scrap -took place in Belgium, but
it was organised and patronised by an exclusively
English crowd—in fact, those were days vvhen you could
•Hardly have dragged anyone but aii Englishman or an
AustralianTo a fist-fight With a chain-hawser. Towards
the finish, when Smith, the English champion and the
favorite, was palpably beaten, a crowd of Englishmen,
described as “Jim Carney’s gang of Birmingham
toughs," bombarded Slavin with gingerbeer bottles
(they realised they were “ in danger of losing their dirty
bets”) and broke the ring. The Englishman throws
whole tropical forests of vegetation at himself on account
of his “fair play.” He admits reluctantly that he is the
most perfectly impartial person on earth. But, at times,
he is a fairly good shot with a gingerbeer bottle.

Johnson is fighting with another of his numerous
managers. This time it is George Little, who was look-
ing after his business when the negotiations with Jeffries
were being carried through. Johnson blurted out that
the reason he sacked Little was that Little desired him to
arrange to lie down before one of Jeffries s fearsome
wallops—the sort of wallop that Jeffries didn t have with
him on the day of the fight. Little, was not slow getting
back, and he seems to have damaged Johnson more than
Jeffries did. According to the gospel of Little, the
Johnson-Ketchell fight was a fake that went wrong. At
a meeting of the principals, he says, it wasjarranged that
the scrap should last 12 rounds for the sake of the pirn
tures and end with a double knock-down. Ketchell got
in his wallop but forgot to fall, and Johnson, furious at
the breach of faith, sprang up and smashed Ketchell
somewhat harder than was agreed upon. BU,t, according
to Little, Ketchell was by no means knocked opt and
could easily have continued. Little also stated that the
Johnson-Kaufmann fight was “a ready,” though in what
respect the telegraph summary of his remarks fails to
explain. Anyhow, fighting is almost as corrupt as horse-
racing. __
“Silk ” on a law point
N.S.W. Full Court has, with some trepidation, given a
humane construction to section 16 of the N.S.W. Divorce
Act. Under this section a wife can obtain 1 a decree on
proof that during one year her husband had repeatedly
beaten and assaulted her. Divorce Judges in the past
have held that the section means that a petitioning wife,
to be successful, must prove that she has been ham-
mered with painful regularity for 12, months. In other
words, a woman, being walloped from January 1 to Sep-
tember 30, and then left to recover between that date
and Christmas, would have no case. No legal benefit
would accrue unless she prevailed upon her husband to
continue the assault right up to December 31 —not even
knocking off for his annual holiday. Recently, however, a
case was before Justice Gordon, where a wife, having been,
hammered forsix months with unfailing regularity, left her)
house of correction and applied for a rule nisi. Gordon,,;
J., followed precedent, and refused the rule. The peti-
tioner then appealed to the Full Court, which august
animal, by a majority, granted the divorce- sought.
Pring, the dissenting voice, argued that, if the Legisla-i
ture said “ during one year,” it didn’t mean during'
half a year, and the only construction to putj
on the section was that Parliament meant that,
before a woman could obtain relief from a wife-
beater she must prove beatings continuously for 12;.
months. Pring didn’t define “continuously,” but as he •«
held to the literal reading of the section in order to make ,
“ during a year ” mean 365 days, “continuously” would 1
probably mean 24 hours a day—which would wear out the
sturdiest husband, to say nothing of the fact that at the l
end of the time there would be no wife left. rj
“ Geofred ” reviews some ancients : j
Travelling along the East Greta Company’s railway line
at South Maitland (N.S.W.) last week, I passed a number
of old, laid-up locomotives, dating back to the long ago.
First the “ Gang Forward,” bringing to mind the bush-
ranging days of “Moonlight.” I was with .the construc-
tion gang on the line from Junee to Narranderaat the
time, and well I remember the excitement of the whole
country-side when the old “Gang Forward ” brought
along "the news that “Moonlight” and his mates
had been captured at the Wantabadgery cattle
station. And the great excitement when we heard
that Bowen was shot 1 Contractor Fishburn rode
through the gangs working round Junee for
volunteers to extinguish the last of Moonlight’s
rangers. I recalled, too, the time when Fishburn himself
was shot, and retired “for an enforced period” after a
morning’s encounter with Topham, of the firm of Top-
ham and Angus. Fishburn was at the time travelling
with the pay cart on the Waterworks. Amongst the
ancients I saw the “ Murrumbidgee,” which took me
back to the time when we got such news as “ The Kellys
are caught.” “A priest and Mrs. Scanlon have been
shot by the police.” “ Ginger Jones’s mother’s pub is
burnt down,” etc. We all knew “ Ginger.” He was
down in Narrandera at the opening of the line, and put
up a great fight with Tommy the Baker. Five weeks
after the capture of “ Moonlight,” I got a copy of the
Australasian from a hawker, and had to read the
account twice over to all hands. The sight of those old
engines rotting at East Greta recalled much history.
Many a mile I travelled on some of the now-rusty foot-
plates, and I don’t mind telling you that I wish I was as
far now from the Home Signal as I was then.

SHOTGUN CARTRIDGES
“NEW RIVAL”
It’s the way they shoot in a gun that marks the differ-
ence between New Rival” shotgun cartridges and other
kinds. They always shoot, and shoot accurately and
uniformly. This is brought about by their method of
construction and loading, together with the extensive
experience of their manufacturers. The loading is all
done by automatic machinery, which exactly measures
the quantity of powder and shot, seats the wads
evenly and crimps the mouth of the cartridge firmly.
All guns shoot better with New Rival ” shotgun
cartridges. They are blue in color and have a corruga-
tion around the head to prevent its pulling off.

OBJECTS OF THE COMPANY.
This Company is being formed to acquire from the vendors all their right, ti tie and interest in,
? nd '*° t ‘ le concession granted by the Manly Council, and the Government of New South Wales,
tor the construction of a Pier—more particularly described hereafter —together with tender, plans
rind specifications as approved by the Government Department, architects’ drawings, surveys,
soundings, borings, etc., made and held by them in connection therewith.
DESCRIPTION.
xr T be •l!’'! 1 ’ be about 000 ft. long by 36ft. wide, and at the seaward end the area of the Pier
Head will be about 300 ft. long by 126 ft. wide. Upon this will be erected a handsome Pavilion,
Wlt mf- roai ? Promenade Balcony outside and interior galleries provided with seating.
This Building will be used for entertainments of ail kinds, such as Grand Concerts, Varieties,
Picture Shows, etc., and will accommodate about 1500 people.
The floor of the building will lie graded so that the audience will have a clear view of the stage
the proscenium of which will be 26ft. wide by 25ft. high.
The Pavilion will also contain large Tea and Refreshment Rooms and a number of small shops
tor the sale of tobacco, sweets, confectionery, etc., and with two larger ones will form part of the
Pavilion Building.
On the ocean frontage of the Pier Head an area of about 126 ft. by 80ft. will be set apart, on
which is to he erected a Band Stand, surrounded with seating accommodation, from which a high-
class Orchestral Band will give performances.
mu Pier - Head a al ; a £ in & for fi shitl S be constructed at a sufficient level above high water.
The Pier will be provided with a large amount of free-seating Accommodation.
As will be seen by the picture, which gives a comprehensive view of the Pier and Pavilion
the structure will be of a very handsome and imposing appearance.
The will be constr ucted on Cast Iron Plies and Columns, and the Piles will be sunk deeply
into the bed of the sea, and will be strongly braced with Steel Bars, Girders and Tie Rods.
The Fact op the Government Engineer having Approved the Plans for the
Construction of the Pier should be sufficient evidence as to its safety.
PROSPECTS OF THE COMPANY.
Manly, with its glorious stretch of beach and surf, may be likened to Brighton, in England in its
wide-spreading attractions. As a seaside resort and pleasure ground it is unequalled, as the immense
number of people who visit it will attest. In ever-increasing numbers they go there to eniov the
fresh breezes and the pleasures of the surf.
Evidencing the growing popularity of the place.it is estimated that approximately 2 000 000
people visited Manly last year, mostly carried by the Port Jackson Company’s steamers and’coming
not only from Sydney, but from all over this and other States; and on the completion of the Spit to
Manly tram-line and the greater facilities for easy travel thus created, the residents of North Shore
and Mosman suburbs will no doubt visit Manly much more frequently than heretofore.
Without considering the needs of Manly, the population of which is steadily growing it is
becoming more apparent that there is urgent need for devising fresh means of catering for the
pleasure and entertainment of the visitors, and nothing could be more fitting or would be more
popular than a grand Promenade Pier, similar to those at most large seaside resorts in England
where all could enjoy the delights of air and sea, and hear fine music rendered by a first-class Band’
or view the ever-popular surf bathing. , ... ’
SOURCES OF REVENUE.
When it is considered what an immense attraction such a Pier would be, it can easily be under-
stood what great numbers would avail themselves of it. It is estimated that last year about 2 000 000
people visited Manly exclusive of Manly residents and season-ticket holders, it is estimated that at
ieast 1,500.000 should make use of the Pier during the season. A considerable revenue is also deri-
vable from the Manly residents, and from a population of 8500 it may be reckoned that there would
be at least 2000 season-ticket holders. It is the intention of the Company to make the low charge of
od. for adults, and Id. for children under 10 years of age.
The regular entertainments which will be provided, and at which the best attainable talent will
perform, it is estimated will also produce a very large revenue. The rent of the large tea and refresh-
ment room, for which a very substantial offer has already been made ; of the ten small shops and two
large ones and the hire of the chairs in the enclosed smee, will further largely help to swell the
revenue. Again, the before-mentioned construction of the fishing stage will be a greiit boon to
fishermen who, without suffering the discomforts of fishing from a boat, will have all the advantages
of deep water and good fishing-ground for a moderate charge. The proiected landing-stage for pas-
sengers and excursion steamers, with the tolls derivable therefrom, will certainly add substantially
to the sum total of returns. J
COMPARISONS.
While giving as above a general view of the source of revenue, it will be worth while, as this
class of investment is new to Australia, to afford information as to the profits earned elsewhere bv
giving a statement of the returns in dividends paid by some of the principal Pier Companies in Eng-
land. and where the numbers visiting the seaside places where these Piers are do not approach the
numbers visiting Manly.
The following figures show the dividends paid by some of the English Companies
BLACKPOOL PIER CO.—Capital, £75,060; dividend and bonuses for last fourteen years —l 2 per
cent, per annum. Improvement, contingent and reserve fund, £22,700.

SOUTHEND PIER 00. —Corporation Property—Profits estimated to be 15per cent, per annum.
1 here are other Promenade Pier Companies in England paying large dividends, of which statis-
ticaLdata is not in the hands of the Vendors.
\\hen it is considered that in England the season at the seaside lasts little more than three
months, and that the above profits are gathered in that short period, the significance of the above
figures may be better realised by comparing the length of the season at Manly, which lasts about
nine months, so that the shareholders may confidently expect handsome dividends.

Leaving a balance of equivalent to 17| per cent, per annum on Capital of the Company.
The above is an approximate estimate of receipts and expenditure based on data gathered from
Jimglisn Promenade Pier Companies, and also upon a visiting and residential population equivalent
to that Of Manly.
The Vendors have received a firm tender from Messrs. ,T. and A. Mayoli, of “ Strathkyle ” Bligli
icr e rnn - C A ney ’ for the construct'd! and completion of the Pier and Pavilion at Manly for the sum of
DkxoOO without extras. The tender compares favorably with the cost of any of the Piers constructed
in Hingland. *
The Pier has been specially designed by them, and they have constructed Piers in verv exposed
positions in the Irish Sea and the North Sea. None of the Piers thev have erected have suffered any
damage from storms or rough seas. It is well known that the English Coast is frequently visited bv
heavy storms and it is Messrs. Mayoh’s opinion that no sea ever likely to visit Manly will interfere
with the stability and success of the work.
The Tenderers have taken borings and have satisfied themselves as to the Suitability of the site
and report that the strata and depth of water is particularly suitable for building the Pier
I bis firm has had a large experience in this class of work, having constructed Promenade Piers
in the following resorts of England :—-
Morecambe
Weston-super-Mare
Penarth
Southsea
Blackpool
Grreac Yarmouth
Beaumaris
Mumbles
and other seaside resorts. The Tenderers have undertaken to commence the work and completesame
and hand over to the Company ready for opening withm eighteen months from the date of com-
mencement, or earlier.
The Company may be congratulated on the securing by the Vendors of the services of the
engmeenng firm of Messrs. J. and A. May oh, who have stipulated that they receive 5000 fully-paid-up
bhares in lieu of £5OOO (hve thousand pounds) cash, as part payment of contract, which may be taken
jas the strongest possible expression of their opinion of the„soundness of the Manly Ealace Pier
Slices o^Mr 11 b n v St p ent ' i And . further - the Vendors are pleased to be able to announce that the
.services of Mr. S. V. Rowe have been retained as Architect. Mr. S. V. Rowe has filled a similar
position in England on four different occasions, and has offered to accept 500 fully-paid-UD Shares 'is
part payment of his fees in lieu of cash. y * P onates as
The following Contracts have been entered into, and it is believed that they are the only Con-
Shareholders, and cop es of the same may be seen at

by SCOTT’S
Emulsion
Scott’s Emulsion perma-
nently restores .strength.
Hundreds of people have
written to say they were cured
of one or another form of
debility by Scott’s Emulsion.
For example, Mr. A. A. Yar-
rington wrote, 12th May,
1909, from 195, Duke Street,
Woolloomooloo, Sydney,
N.S.W.:
“ A serious operation left me very weak, and
as I also had a severe cold, I decided to try
rg
Scott’s Emulsion. I felt ,
better after a few doses, and
before the first bottle was done,,
the cold ivas quite cured. I
am now thoroughly strong
and well; Scott’s Emulsion
worked wonders for me. This
trademark was on the emul-
sion I bought. ”
If you wish to get rid ot your
debility, and decide to buy
Scott’s Emulsion, decide
also to GET SCOTT’S
EMULSION. You may be
asked to buy another emul-
sion and told it is “just as
good as Sco 11 ’ s.” Substitute
emulsions can only be sold
on.the reputation of Scott’s
Emulsion.
Scott’s Emulsion cures the disease-
no matter the age of the patient—and
will be approved by your Doctor for
Debility if you ask him.

1. Gambling is trying to get gain at
another’s loss ; it is a part of a larger whole,
an outward trouble begotten of something
inward— viz., love of money, excessive desire
for gain.
2. Finding money and keeping it and
winning money by gambling, are morally
about equal.
3. Betting is, upon occasion, both lawful
and' right; but gambling never is.
4., A n opinion worth having- is worth back-
ing ; but let it be done more to show that
you believe in what you say, that you have
the courage of your convictions, than to
make money. Many a battlefield has been
but a backing of opinion.
5. If all backing and betting were done in
silver coin only, and winnings given to
charitable purposes, there would be increase
both of real sport and of enjoyment from
same, as well as of income to the charities,
with a corresponding decrease of desire for
unlawful gain.
6. If some of the “ upper ten” were to
set example as above suggested, same would
spread to the multitude ; and what is now
largely a nuisance, if not a curse, would
become a means of amusement, for all equally
pleasurable and useful.- — Advt.

“The Hack”: Consider the inappropriate titles of
many Australian journals. Melbourne has a one-eyed
Argus ; a Leader which doesn’t lead anybody or any-
thing ; a Lifk which signifies death to the hopes of Aus-
tralian authors and artists; an Every Saturday which
makes its appearance each Wednesday ; a Sporting and
Dramatic News which is neither sporty nor dramatic,
but just plain stodge ; a Review of Reviews which never
reviews the reviews, but merely summarises them ; an
Australian Journal in which the greater part of the
mutter is the product of English and American writers ;
and a New Idea which hasn’t had a fresh notion in it
since its birth—not even regarding its title, which was
cribbed from an American journal. Funniest of all, it
possesses a journal which, while bearing the name of
Punch, is absolutely the dullest hitter on earth.

“ Harrison O.”: Lord Alfred Douglas and T. H. Cros-
land have severed their connection with London
Academy in a flare of blue flame and curses. They cer-
tainly made the old sheet hum while they ran It. They
attacsed in turn nearly every paper of note in the U.K.,
and by doing so won much enmity. They rowed with
W. H. Smith and Son,Ltd., the big news agents, so that the
latter refused to handle the Academy. Then they assailed
John Lane, and in consequence he was forced to withdraw
from circulation a novel alleged to be of quite exceptional
naughtiness. The Manners-Sutton trouble followed. The
London Spectator and its owner-editor, the inexpressibly
dull St. Loe Strachey, came in for special attention.
Shaw and Wells were also among those subjected to
scathing criticism, and nearly all the present-day Eng-
lish poets were mercilessly attacked. The Academy itself
certainly set a splendid- example by the quality of its
verse. Douglas is a polished and graceful versifier and a
master of the sonnet, and he contributed some line things
to the uproarious weekly.

“Bill Sticker” : Evidently our ’possum is coming into
his own. Three times lately have I come across him.
Once was in a published set of light verses, wherein the
lady’s hand had “ a’possum-skin softness about it.” Next
wqs in Tiie B.’s “Answers to Correspondents," wherein
the rude person who gives back-talk enthused over this
“joyously novel Australian touch”—“Her eyes grew
soft as the pleading eyes of an opossum.” Now in Ada
Cambridge’s “The Eternal Feminine” I find: “She
gazed on the compelling beauty in ■ a hypnotic sort of
way, as an opossum stares at a lantern that suddenly
supersedes the moon.” It does me good to meet the
timid little chap in places where I don’t expect to find
him.

“Lud”: The British Museum has the Mel-
bourne Morning Herald Almanac for 1849, and a num-
ber of other literary relics which,. though intensely
attractive for Melbourne or Sydney, excite little interest
in London and might well be disgorged. The Herald
Almanac conveys a reader into the thick of Melbourne
61 years ago. A’Beckett was the only Judge. The prac-
tising barristers were Stawell,.Barry, Williams, Pohlman,
Croke and Sidney Stephen. The first four got on the
Bench. There is reference to one Clirr, who ought not
to have been' forgotten all these years, because he was
afterwards called the Father of Separation. In 1849 the
Port Phillip district, not then called Victoria, flouted
N.S.W. by electing Earl Grey, the Colonial Minister, to
the Sydney Parliament. This excited much notice in
1 London, and had its weight in the creation of Victoria.
The Herald proprietor and editor in 1849 was Cavanagh,
a smart man, famed for his lovely daughters, afterwards
the stars of St. Stephen’s Church, Richmond. The
, reporters were “ Garryowen ” Finn and Jack Curtis.

The : other day London Morning Leader, meaning to
crack up its special articles, said that “ 300,000 of the in-

And in the preface to a law book just to hand the author
says : “Merchants and shippers will not, I think, waste

“ Dux : Between drinks, the Successful M.L. up-
country editor told us How It Was Done : “ Away back
in the ’Bo’s I was cutter for Taylor and Pants, of Taihape.
Baldwin (of the Bounder) popped in one afternoon for a
quiet chat, and I noticed that he couldn’t keep his eyes
off me slicing up rolls of tweed with the 2ft. scissors.
It seemed to fascinate Baldwin. At last he said, ‘Look
here, Wilson, old chap ; this tailoring game is no good
to you. How would you like a shot at journalism ? ’
‘ Journalism,’ I shouted. ‘ Why, I couldn’t write my
mother-in-law’s obituary notice.’ ‘No,’ said Baldwin;
‘ but you’re a wonderfully good hand with those
scissors.’ I thought he was joking, but an offer
of £3 tempted me, and on Monday morning I
commenced operations at the Bounder office. Bald-
win staggered in during the afternoon, beered-up, as
usual. I assumed an air of importance and scribbled
hurriedly, as I presumed reporters ought to do. ‘ What
on earth are you doing, Smith?’ shrieked my new boss,
pointing an acccusing hand at my copy. Blushing deeply,
I replied, ‘Just writing a short leader, Mr. Baldwin.’
‘ Writing ! Writing !! ’ he yelled. ‘My G—d ! WRIT-
ING !11 when there is such a lovely pile of beautiful
exchanges on the table before you ! Didn’t I supply you
with a bucket of paste and a four-foot pair of scissors?
Have you got no brains at all?’,” It was then time for
the next drink. r , i
A GRIZZLE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
At the annual meeting of the Literature Society of
Melbourne, held on the ISth inst., the subject of the
presidential address was “Nature in Meredith and
Wordsworth." —News item.
Let us arise and grizzle—come, let’s raise a discontented
song !
Let us remain no longer dumb, but shove our barrow
right along !
Though Wordsworth turn beneath his sod, let us re-
member those who drive
Australian quills—all those who plod along our tracks,
the souls that strive,
By slinging ink around, to show the world what this
Australia is
When fires of love or hatred glow, and wines of glad
existence fizz.
Let us discuss the sort of thing the good Australian can
digest.
Let us a swag of laurels bring
To crown them that Australia sing !
What of Grant Bedford . . . and the rest?
Let’s crowd around and thump his good Australian back,
who knows the way
To build his rhyme-stuff as he should, in straight Aus-
tralian, grim or gay.
Let’s speak a piece concerning those bright souls that
brim with fancies fine,
Talk some of him who Beauty knows and, knowing, pens
a lovely line ;
Discuss him who, sweet-murmuring, to Inspiration’s
fount draws near
In clean kid gloves, when kid’s the thing, wearing a rose
behind his ear;
Or him who, at his writing job, dispenses with his coat
and vest.
Oh, blow the whole imported mob !
Let some appreciation lob
On Roderic Cabot—and the rest.
The old-world scribblers used to write good stuff? All
right—and blither, too !
They do it now, indeed, and fight for fame and cash till
all is blue.
They strive and toil—and even so our eager-souled Aus-
tralians do
With blither and good stuff ; and grow a decent bank-
account or two.
So let us, if we must give tongue about the brainy blokes
who write,
Delve our Australian brains among, and drag the good
lots to the light.
Come on, advance Australia yet—and blank the dashed
importing pest!
We want to know ! We ought to get
More news of our Australian set!
Henry O’Brady . . . and the rest.

129 Honrs Non-Stop
Day and Night Ploughing
“We wish to say that the ploughing done by the 20-h.p. “1.H.C.” Gasolene Traction
Engine and the one 4, and one 5-furrow “Ontario” Disc Ploughs has been nothing short
of a revelation to us.
“We saw the work started at 7 minutes past 7 a.m. on Monday morning, August Ist and finish
at 7 minutes past 4 p.m. on Saturday, August 6th., During the whole 129 hours the engine did not
stop for one single instant, day and night, and finished with so much reserve power as to thoroughly satisfy %
us that she could have easily hauled another plough all the time.
“In addition to the large acreage ploughed, what surprised us was the condition of both the engine and the
ploughs, at the finish—the bearings on the engine being so cool that she might have only been running for a couple
of hours instead of 129 hours, while the ploughs, in spite of the stony ground, have stood foe strain remarkably.
“The work has not only been done, but done well, and no one could possibly wish for anything better.
“We are both now thoroughly satisfied that anyone who has large holdings to plough is throwing away
good money by doing the work with horses, because the “1.H.C.” Tractor has proved this to us.”
C Signed)

The above letter from the owners of the land ploughed tells in brief the story of a Most Remarkable
Performance, full particulars of which including the certified acreage ploughed, the fuel and lubricants used,
etc., and illustrations of the outfit at work, are contained in a pamphlet which is yours for the asking.
BMP* If you have work for an engine of any size, it will pay you to send for this pamphlet
now because all types of the “1.H.C.” are identical in general construction with the
engine that hadn’t a single hot bearing after running continuously for 129 hours,

“gunrip"
Forest Devil.
The Roots Must Come Out,
as well as the Trunk.
POSITIVELY the hardest work the Farmer, Settler or Squatter is called upon to do is
grubbing. The old method of uprooting dry or green stumps and trees is now entirely
revolutionised by the introduction on the market of the most marvellous labor-saving
device for Farmers, etc., ever invented. It is called “The Bunyip Forest
Devil.” This particular Forest Devil is far superior to any other Forest Devil in the market,
in that it is the very essence of simplicity in adjusting and in manipulating. The most
admirable features of “ The Bunyip Forest Devil ” are that it is not only light in weight
and can be moved with the greatest ease from tree to tree, where it can be rapidly fixed and
adjusted, but it is absolutely certain to accomplish almost any task set to it.
The tremendous strain which can bo brought to bear with “ The Bunyip Forest
Devil ’’ makes it absolutely imperative for the tree or stump to leave the ground entirely—
roots and all, no matter how big the tree or stump, how long it has been growing, or how
firmly it be rooted in the ground.
Many “land men,” once doubtful of the assertions claimed for it, are now loud in their
praises of the unbounded and entire satisfaction it has given in their case, and in many
instances they have paid for the cost of the machine in a very short while by hiring it to
their neighbors.
Convincing proof of its wonderful power and its durability, the quickness with which it
can be adjusted, the labor and money it saves, will be found in a special and attractive
catalogue Messrs. John Cooper & Sons, 287-289 Elizabeth Street, Melbourne, have just issued.
Copies will be sent free to every enquirer, together with any other information required.

That unpleasant and even painful burning' sensation, usually referred to as “drawing the feet,”complained
of by wearers of the ordinary pliinsoll and other rubber-soled shoes, has always been a drawback in the rubber
shoe trade. Every retailer knows that many buyers of plimsolls, especially of children’s sizes, have grave mis-
givings about doing so, while a very great number will not purchase rubber shoes of this description at all,
because of this complaint. The cause of all the trouble we have now successfully overcome. Allay

THE COMMERCIAL BANKING COMPANY OF SYDNEY, LIMITED.
Auditors:
Messrs. KENT, BRIERLEY & SULLY, Public Accountants, The Strand, Sydney.
FELDHEIM, GOTTHELF, LIMITED, is being formed for the purpose of acquiring as a going concern and
continuing the Old-Established and successful business carried on for the last 43 years by the well-known
firm of Feldheim, Qotthelf and Co., Sydney and London, General Merchants and Importers of British,
American and Continental Goods.
The business was founded about the year 1867, and has been so prosperous that two of the partners,
Messrs. Moritz Gotthelf and William Gross, having acquired a competency, intend to discontinue the strenuous life
inseparable from the conduct of such a large undertaking, and to retire from active business.
The third and youngest partner, Mr. Lewis E. Isaacs, prefers to continue his connection with the business.
Mr. Isaacs’s experience in the firm has shown him that, with more Capital at its command than it has hitherto
had, the expansion of the business would result in even larger profits than have been made in the past, and he has
agreed to take the position of Managing Director for at least 12 years, and to take a large holding in the Capital of
the Company. • .
This position of affairs gives an opportunity to the investing public to become shareholders in an old-
established profit-making concern, where the additional Capital will provide for larger stocks, new departments
and general expansion, with excellent prospects of good profits.
The Vendors will apply for 30,001) Contributing Shares in the Company.
This Company is not entering upon an untried speculative business, but acquires a firmly-established
enterprise of high repute under exceptionally favorable circumstances having a large business connection and
sphere of operations, notin distant parts, but in New South .Wales, where hitherto it has prospered and made a
handsome return to its proprietors.
With fresh and larger Capital to replace that which will be withdrawn by partners retiring to well-earned
ease, and to provide for the requirements of progress and enlargement, it is reasonable to expect that with ever-
increasing population, and with the able and experienced management of Mr. L. E. Isaacs, the past success of this
business will be continued and increased.
An Investigation of the Books by Messrs. Kent, Brierley and Sully, Public Accountants, shows that the Net
Sales for the four years 1907, 1908, 1909 and 1910, average £232,332 per annum.
The Net Profit made during the same period averaged £8,589 per annum, and, after allowing for an adequate
sum for management, shows 12 per cent, per annum on the average Capital of the proprietors.
The Assets to be taken over, consisting of Stock, Book Debts, Bills Receivable, Fixtures, Fittings, etc.,
amount to £116,243, against which there are Trade Liabilities amounting to £59,051.
The Total Amount to be paid for the business, including £20,000 for Goodwill, is £77,192. The return,
calculated on, the average Annual Profits for the past Four years, is over 7 per cent, per annum on this amount,
and with the increased Capital it is expected that larger dividends will be earned.
The business will be taken over as and from the date of the last Balance-Sheet, March 31st, 1910, an
equitable allowance being made to the Vendors for the estimated profits for the Six Months ended September 30,
1910, upon which date the management will pass to this Company.
The Open Accounts and Bills Receivable are guaranteed by the Vendors.
Messrs. Qotthelf and Gross will remain as Directors until the first meeting of the Company.
The onl.v Agreements affecting the Company are :
(1) A Sale aid Purchase Agreement dated the Twenty-fourth day of August, 1910. made between
Moritz Gotthelf, Lewis Edward Isaacs, and William Gross of the one part, and John Kenton behalf of
the Company of the other part.
(2) A Flotation and Underwriting Agreement dated the Twenty-fourth day of August, 1910, made
between Moritz Gotthelf, Lewis Edward Isaacs and William Gross of the first part, Dixson Trust
Limited of the second part, and John Kent, Arthur James Brierley and Edward Henry Sully, trading
as Kent, Brierley and Sully of the third part.
These Agreements may be seen at the Office of Kent, Brierley and Sully, The Strand.
CERTIFICATE OF KENT, BRIERLEY & SULLY, Public Accountants,
The Strand, Sydney.
We have investigated the Books of Messrs. Feldheim, Gotthelf & Co., and have compared them with their
Audited Balance-Sheets for the Four Years ended March 31, 1910.
We find that the Average Net Profit for the Four Years 1907, 1908, 1909 and 1910 was £8589 Os. 4d. per annum,
and after allowing for an adequate amount as salaries to partners, this gives a return of 11 "85 per cent, per annum
upon the Average Capital provided by the partners.
The Average Net Sales amount to £232,332 per annum ( and, in our opinion, an increase of Capital allowing of
advantages in buying more largely for Cash, thus securing Discounts on Purchases, as well as a saving in Interest

OBJECTS OF THE COMPANY.
The Company has been formed for. the purpose (inter alia) of acquiring from Messrs. J. C. Dillon and 11. M|Murdie
(who are the promoters of the Company) the option they hold over the well-known business Of the Victorian
Parcels Express Mayne Nickless and Co. Pty. Ltd., including its entire working plant, leases, storage accounts, con-
tracts and agreements, together with the goodwill of the said business, and all other rights and benefits now in the
possession or enjoyed by the Vendor Company (but not the book debts or freeholds) for the sum of £BOOO and 4000
shares in this Company fully paid up to £1 each.
The. Company will also have an option of leasing or purchasing the freeholds now held by the Vendor Company.
It is also intended to establish in connection with the said business a Motor Express Parcels Delivery Service in
Melbourne, and in such other cities of the Commonwealth of Australia as the Company or the Directors may decide.
It is proposed to despatch these delivery vans at stated intervals during the day to the various suburbs, thus re-
ceiving the greatest despatch with the fullest amount of security and economy, while the vans now in use will be
used to work the more outlying suburbs.
The promoters have employed Messrs. Strangward and Shacked, accountants, to investigate the business of
the Vendor Company, and, as the result of such examination, are satisfied that such business is a perfectly sound
and improving one, making good profits, and is capable of enormous expansion under the proposed new system of
Motor Carrying Waggons, in conjunction with the present horse vans, and have no hesitation in recommending the
venture to the investing public as a sound proposition, capable of earning good dividends from its inception.
The new Company will have the advantage of the long, practical experience in the business of Mr. Enoch
Nickless, as General Manager, with Mr. M'Murdie as Assistant Manager.
It is estimated that one 16-h.p. 4-cylinder magnetic ignition motor-van, to carry 15 cwt., price £450, will earn
£22 10s, per week, while the expenses are estimated at £Bl7s. 2d.
This would leave a net profit per week on each large motor of £l3 12s. 10d., and reducing this by one-third, the
very handsome profit of £9 Is. lid. per still shown, which would mean a yearly profit of over 100 per cent,
per annum on the capital outlay (exclusive of general working expenses and management).
It is also proposed to have light delivery motor-waggons, costing about £220, from which the estimated
earnings per week would be £l5, less running cost, estimated per week at £8 4s. lOd.
This would give a weekly profit of £6 15s. 2d. per week, and, again reducing this by one-third, there remains
the handsome profit of £4 10s. 2d. per week, or over 100 per cent, per annum of the capital cost (exclusive of general
working expenses and management).
A recent test was made by a London retail softgoods firm, with the result that a motor delivery van delivered
200 parcels over 100 miles on 5 gallons of petrol in one day.'
The following is the.plant, stock-in-trade and contracts of the Vendor Company, viz. : 40 Express Waggons
and 5 now being built; 88 Horses, 4 Furniture Waggons, 7 Lorries, 60 Sets Harness, 2 Pony Jinkers, Hand Trucks
and sundries, horse-rugs and stable utensils, about 600 Order Boxes, blacksmiths’ shop appliances, wheelwrights’
shop appliances, harness-makers’ shop appliances, storages accrued at South Yarra and Francis-street, Melbourne
(£l3OO, valued at £500), horse feed in stock (valued at £700), office fittings, etc., post-office contract (about two
years to go), railways contract (about two years to go), harbor trust contract (about three years to go), all of which
will be acquired by the Company from the Vendor Company in the aforesaid purchase price of £BOO, and 4000 shares
fully paid to £1 each. The same are valued by the Vendor Company at the sum of £7370, the balance, £4630, being
goodwill.
A Company having similar objects to this Company was successfully floated in a few hours in Sydney a few days
back, and it is hoped that arrangements will be arrived at for reciprocity in exchange of etc., between the
two companies.
The qualification for a director is 50 shares. There are no auditors, but auditors will be appointed at the
first meeting of shareholders. *-
The Company will pay 6d. per share brokerage on all shares allotted through recognised sharebrokers or
authorised agents.

Companies Act 1896. Copies of the complete prospectus and forms of application for shares may be obtained froth

IN BANANA LAND
Premier Phidston has opened his mouth
and spoken severely about the new ports which
Queensland must have, and the old ones that it
could do fairly well without. Queensland's ports,
in fact, are, to a great extent, a disaster all round.
The idea of the hardy old pioneer was to go up a
river till he found fresh water to drink, and till
the water was so shallow that he could con-
veniently wade across the river. Having arrived
at this desirable spot, he started his town. He
liked rivers (1) because they were drinkable; (2)
because they led to fertile flats on which he could
grow produce; (3) because they were handy, in
the absence of roads and railways, for rafting or
canoeing the cabbages down to market. And the
bar at his river, mouth didn’t trouble him,
for his ship of 3ft. draft could get over all
right. When he found a deep-water port
that had no bar he passed it w ith a curse or a
shudder. There were no rivers of fresh water
flowing into it; no river flats to settle upon; no
stream on which to raft or punt his goods, and
there were aimost always high hills round the
deep-water port to make travelling difficult. So
the old pioneer bogged in, and whenever he got
the chance he put his “port” away up a river
where modern vessels can’t get at it unless about
twice the value of the town is spent in dredging a
channel to it. And then, just as soon as the
channel is completed, some one goes and builds a
bigger ship. And even if the channel is kept of
sufficient depth big ships seldom come in ; to
crawl 40 miles up a river and then 40 miles down
again costs too much time. So Phidston reckons
that something must be done for the neglected
deep-water ports. And he is right. If something
isn’t done, Queensland, with most of its “ports”
inland, and its real sea-coast harbors empty,
and with its sea-commerce mostly done by
lighters in choppy bays, will be one of the Seven
Blunders of the World.
Advfc. from the Killarney (Q.) paper :
FELLOW-COUNTRYMEN are invited to attend meet-
ing- to be held in Lee Fat’s humpy on Saturday night to
consider the best means of according Charlie Ah Sue and
his missus a fitting send-off on the eve of their departure
to China.—Signed, Lek Fat.
Well, there is no “side,” anyway, about the refer-
ence to the residence of Mr. Lee Fat. And
“missus” is so comprehensive, so non-committal.
A firm of cordial manufacturers which
started business ahout 12 months ago found
Brisbane’s water so impure during the wet
wpather last summer that it couldn’t use it for
making the stuff that the No Licence person
swallows when he’s out for a devil of a time. So
the firm put down a bore in the heart of the city
and got 2000 gallons a day. Not many city water
supplies have had a harder brick thrown at them
than that.
Queensland’s Under-Secretary for Justice
got a letter, the other day, from John Bramstqn,
Bananaland’s second Attorney-General, acknow-
ledging the receipt: of a copy of the Justice
Department’s jubilee souvenir, which contained
portraits of all the State’s Attorneys-General
from Ratcliffe Bring, the first, to Tom O’Sul-
livan, the last. Bramston’s name is in the
list twice over. He and Herbert, first Premier of
Queensland, were bosom friends; Hers ton-road
(Brisbane) is named after the two of them. They
were the first barristers admitted to the Banana-
land Bar, just over 50 years ago. Neither of
them stuck to the State, though ; Bramston left it
for the Cold Country 3G years back.
“ S.R.” : I don’t know how tough an
alligator’s hide is, but I’ll wager that it isn’t in the
same class as the hide of the average shire coun-
cillor in Queensland. There was one deputation
of shire councillors before Minister Digby Denham
the other day that couldn’t have been pierced
with a harpoon. These shire alligators, after
some preliminary tears, calmly demanded £l5OO
from the Government to expend upon a bridge in
their district. Denham, after cross-examining
the saurians for a few minutes, extracted the
amazing information that their council had a
yearly revenue of only £4OO, for the simple and
sufficient reason that the rate struck was the
colossal sum of fd. in the £. Then Denham rang
the'dinner-bell and told the messenger to show
the deputation to the nearest lagoon.
In Brisbane the old Social Purity Brigade
has cast its ancient skin and come forth as a
brand new glittering Council of Morality. One
of the first assertions made at the Council of
Morality’s meetings was that the “ school children
of Queensland are immoral and degenerated.”
This assertion is not based on the statements of
any public official, and is made without any show
of evidence behind it. Instead of being sup-
ported by anybody who knows, it is contradicted
by the reports of the school inspectors, by the
experience of the police and by the statistics of
juvenile crime, and could only have been begotten
and conceived in the marvellous brain of the cult of
the Gimlet. Something ought to be done to this
poisonous type of Stinking Fish hawkers; and as
the law isn’t designed to do anything, the only
thing that remains is for the decent parent of the
libelled offspring to pour out his whole stock of
contempt upon the new brigade.
“ Pefcifi ” writes ” :
I observe that the Queensland Government proposes
to hang the monkey-wrench on the safety-valve in order
to conserve steam, or to sit on the dynamite to prevent
it all going off at once—in other words, it is going to try
to regulate the flow from the State’s artesian bores.
The idea is that if the bores are allowed to flow at their - '
own pleasure the underground supply may give out.
And remembering the vast importance the live bores
are to the State, one can sympathise with th@ Govern-
ment’s anxiety to prevent them becoming dead bores.
Still there are stupendous possibilities about the notion
of regulating the flow. Even now - , while the vents are
free, they are unable to soothe the impatience of the
tremendous forces that are humping their backs away
down in the deeps—a fact that is proved by the water
which, in the majority of cases, drives its way to the sur-
face even round the outside of the pipes. A notable
feature of many of the bores is that, at the point where
the pipes emerge from the ground, the surface-js raised ■
above the surrounding landscape—in some instances, as
much as 2ft. The uplifting has occurred since the bores
began to flow, and it suggests the power of the upward
shove. I will watch with interest this scheme for shoving
back Niagara. Of course, this is Niagara falling upward,
but I don’t fancy that makes much difference. It makes me
think of the man who stood at the mouth of a cannon and
tried to plug back the torrent of flowing cannon ball.
That man is no more.
If Jud. Would Come!
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Two Queensland clergymen were recently sued for
breach of promise. —Press item.
An effort is to be made to induce the Rev. Judkins to
visit Queensland. —Another item.
tF Jud. would come to wild Bananalaud,
And snatch our erring parsons—as a brand
Is snatched from burning—then with heart
elate
We yet might save “ the cloth ” from hellish fate,
And lead the wanderers back within the Gate,
If J ud. would come !
For Satan he hath twined a woman’s hair,
And ta’en the Righteous in a hellish snare,
And naught avails to save them from the mesh
Wherein they daily tie their souls afresh,
Unless —to fight the World and ban the Flesh—
Great Jud. would come !
If Jud. would come and Belial’s crew impeach,
Perchance no maids would sue the Church “for
breach.”
No preacher then might come before the Court,
And cause the gay ungodly sinful sport,
What time he should be chanting “ Hold the
Fort,”
If Jud. would come.
If Jud. would come and lead for just a space
The Booze and Bookie to Throne of Grace,
Then might the scoffers yet be stricken dumb*
Then might the Northern Godly look less glum,
And Satan’s stock might cease to rise and hum,
If Jud. would come.

Brisbane, September 3, 1910.
My Dkir Th argomindah, —
The air is thick with rumor as to the course the
Government will take to put the hospitals upon a
less rickety basis. Unless something unspecified
is done the committee of the General Hospital is
afraid to face another year; and no doubt that is
why a fairly representative conference of the
various institutions saw Premier Kidston last
week upon the matter, at his own invitation. A
few days later the Courier got a scare ; but, in
reality, nothing more revolutionary than a tax
upon amusements is suggested, the moneys to be
handed over to the present committees to spend.
A FAVORABLE SYMPTOM.
HOSTESS: “Has Harry proposed yet?”
GUEST: “No; but he’s thinking seriously. Last night I caught him reading ‘How to be
Happy Though Married.’”
Perhaps a simpler method would be to make the
hospitals State institutions, and charge them to
the general revenue. It is a curious business —
this idea of setting aside one special source of
revenue for the support of hospitals. If more
money is wanted for roads and bridges no one
proposes a special cat duty, and the idea of levy-
ing a poll-tax on high-lieeled boots for the main-
tenance of the new University wasn’t mooted
even onee.
Still another pair of trustful young people here
are busy receiving congratulations. The man
half of the proposed new firm is Jack Petrie, he
who is so excellent at running the dance and tug-
ging the oar. From now on he will be labelled :
“This is the property of Miss'Dorothy Ryder.”
And while this whiff of orange-blossom is in the
air, let me breathlessly mention that you will
have two local brides down your'way in a week or
so. The meats are baking for the marrying of
Miss Brenda Macalister to Mr. Middleton, in the
lamp-lit hours of Tuesday next, and Miss O’Reilly
and Mr. Paterson will swiftly follow the good
example.
New sessional orders have been devised for the
curtailment of the Assembly’s flow of rhetoric.
I disremember just what the ingenious pull-up
methods are, but they are said to be quite as
effectual as those of Tierra Del Fuego, where the
speaker must stand on one leg. “Dinny” Keogh
was the first to have his speech scissored by the
deputy-Chair. As the fatal moment arrived he
was assisted by the Opposition members, who
kept time for him, and such interjections as “Two
laps to go ” cheered him on his way.
I hear that one of the two eligible bachelors
upon the Government side, the member for Wide
Bay, contemplates retiring, with a view to giving
; more time to the business of acquiring souvenirs
of royalty.
In all the glory of record-making, the two
Kidman sisters have arrived in Brisbane, having
just dismounted from a little jaunt on horseback
of 1000 miles across country from South Aus.
with the Cattle King, their father. Of him we
have heard much, but little or nothing of the two
dainty brown girls who smile at you like pretty ,
gipsies. Very business-like they look in their
ride-astride kit of khaki coats, leggings, smart felt
hats and the other things sensible folk wear
while on the roof of the horse. A handy camera
and business-like little rifles form part of
their outfit. Miss Edna tells you with
rapture of the beauties of- this, her very own
land. Both girls laugh over the “ bush feathers ”
upon which they slept as often as not; and the
scrambles over the sandhills and through the
flood-waters of the Cooper, and the yabbie-
catching with the mission blacks; and the hand
they lent at a giant muster on the Queensland
border ; and they rhapsodise over the fertility of
the so-called desert, the rich fruit gardens and
the exquisite flowers they found at some of the
Outback homes.
News comes of a double-header in the orange-
blossom game. Two daughters of the house of
Worthington, of Turkey station, have snuggled
in the shadow of the same bride-cake. The happy
man in one case is Mr. B. Hickman, but the
name of the other bridegroom has broken loose
and is hereby advertised for.
A ripple went round a meeting of the Young
Christian Women’s Association, the other day,
when an elderly young thing stood up and de-
clared that every policeman should know the way
to the Y.W.C.A. rooms. Now the wicked want
to know whether Mr. John Hop is desired on the
premises for business or for pleasure.
Miss Edith Dickson, the long-absent secretary
of the Pioneer Club, has booked her passage
homeward in February next; and Mrs. A. Hertz-
berg will be here before. Cup time.
Things seem to be looking up in the Auto Club,
and the hon. treasurer begins to know once more
the color of filthy lucre. Up till now the mem-
bers did not stoop to anything so commonplace as
the regular paying of subscriptions, while it is
said that the door of the club room was only once
opened during the year. On that occasion the in-
truder simply looked in to write a letter of angry
remonstrance; but finding the ink dried up
and the pens growing a new set, he
ga*ve it up. And so did at the
enc * of fc be 12 months. In the secretary
matter things have not gone like melted
butter since the first year, and at no time
has there been any large amount of lion
lying down with any great quantity of lamb.
many as three of the council of 10 have been
known to pay ; but this was just an outbreak and
was hushed up and overlooked.. Now however,
business-like methods are being tried, and the men,-
bership, which had sorely dwindled, is rising again
club made a new start last week, when it
went in a body and remonstrated, more in sorrow
than in anger, with Home Secretary Appel over
h'S recently-introduced speed-limit,
From the utmost parts of the earth come the
applications of men who want to be professors at
our University. From the Commonwealth and
Maoriland alone some 40 applications have been
received, and an untold multitude is understood
to be thirsting in John Bull’s country to come
and teach the young Australian how to shoot.
Great is the rejoicing in the McEncroe and
Buchanan clan over the visit of the stork to the
former household. A daughter was the souvenir
he left.
Apart from presiding at the annual meeting of
the Industrial Home, theGovornment House folk
have been having a little rest, relieved by an in-
formal dinner or so.
Yours affectionately,
MARIO.
Queensland is shaking up its railway policy
to meet at least some of the requirements of the
life that is crowding into its vast spaces. Last
year 293 miles of new railways were started and
147 more were authorised. To-day, Bananaland
has the greatest mileage of rails in the Common-
wealth, and, in proportion to population, it holds
the world’s record.
Tom Petrie, the oldest inhabitant who
died the other day, was brought to Queensland
in the James Watt, the first steamer to enter
Moreton Bay. Tom’s father was one of Dr.
Lang’s immigrants—the Seotchbyterian and por-
ridge crowd that the poreupiny parson imported
to give backbone to the country. Moreton Bay
was a penal station at the time ; and the Petries
camped in the “female factory,” where the post-
office now stands —or rather rambles all over the
shop.

FROOTOIDS
Cure Headache, Indigestion, Constipa-
tion, and Biliousness. They are elegant
in appearance and pleasant to take
they are immensely more valuable tham
an ordinary aperient; they remove from;
the blood, tissues, and internal organs,,
waste poisonous matter that is clogging;
them and choking the channels that lead)
to and from them. Frootoids are
THE BEST
aperient medicine to take when any
Congestion or Blood Poison is present,
or when Congestion of the Brain or
Apoplexy is present or threatening. They
have been tested, and have been proved
to afford quick relief in such cases when
other aperients have not done any good
at all. Frootoids are absolutely un-
rivalled for
FAMILY
use; their beneficial effects are evident
by the disappearance of headache—a
bright cheery sense of perfect health
taking the place of sluggish depressed
feelings, by the liver acting properly, and
by the food being properly digested.
Frootoids are a very economical
MEDICINE.
A dose taken once a week, at bed-time,
is highly beneficial. They act splendidly
on the Liver. A constipated habit of
body will be completely cured if the
patient will on each occasion, when
suffering, take a dose of Frootoids in-
stead of an ordinary aperient. The
sufferer thus gradually becomes quite ;
independent of Aperient Medicines.

taken re contributions voluntarily submitted, whether
sent by post or handed in; and no MS. will be
returned unless stamps (of any State) accompany.
L.K.: “ Exiled ”is an undefined sort of lament.
“Rembrance” (doubtless meant for “Remembrance”)
disfigured by quaint, expressions (“ Chrystal fairies fori
and you ” ; “ bell-birds calling to you and I” ; “is it I
must remember never?” and the like). Gave up “A
Aoice from the Flames" at the second line —the one
which read, “ My sleuth-hounds chained in smoulder.”
If you chained any kind of a hound in smoulder the
Cruelty-to-Animals Society should have been informed.
Let the dog loose at once Kareelah : Two poems
received—one about a hat and the other about Pat—
whose other name was Casey. Both treated with
scorn Riverina : That bee-blowfly story has been
dished up in one form and another—but always
with the blowfly in it—till it deserves burial....
Scorpion: A good lie told in wretchedly irregular
verse....G. Back: A not very interesting story of two
niggers fighting... .J.E.YV.: Your tale of how you killed
a “native cat” made us feel ill. For lleaven’s sake
keep the secret of your ferocity to yourself Sil : If
London Opinion said that, it is a thief. We said it our-
selves, in those words, three months ago Saphead :
Your idea for settling international disputes is brightly
put, but very, very old H. T. McClure : “Bryant's
Journey” was returned on March 12 ; and a letter telling
you so, in reply to your growl, has been fired back “ un-
known and unclaimed.”.... A. Berry or Bean or some-
thing : Horrible writing, faint ink and a railway grievance
of an involved and breathless nature. Go to
Bloomaphone : Nauseous story to hand. Writing is not
your line; try screwing washersi on taps.... Norman C. :
Fairly rhymed, but It six-line verses on a play which,
thoug'h here to-day may be off to-morrow, so to speak, are
over the odds... .G.B.D. : Fail to follow j’our leg-iron
cartoon idea... .Tahuna (M.L.): Verses unsuitable....
Cleon : Sonnet beginning “ Away ! Away ! thou wintry,
icy' blast l"’ hurriedly' wrapped up in the envelope you so
thoughtfully provided and sent home. It is a cheery
springtime whoop, but worthless from a literary point of
view C.VV.E. (M.L.): The catastrophe is too small...
H.C.E. : “A Voice from the Depths” is frequently in-
distinct; it merely calls for explanation when it moans
darkly like this : \
Oh Nation of coffers filled with gbld
Whose poor doth wan in the nightly cold.
... E.B.T. (Chillagoe, Q.): To your queries—(1) It is
doggerel. (2) The metre and rhythm of the\wp last lines
are faulty; the third line has two more syllables than
the first, with which it rhymes ; the fourth has two
more syllables than the second. The worst fault, how-
ever, is in the phrasing of the third line: “ And the
thirsty of Chillagoe sing, “ Give to me.” The' thirsty of
Chill.igoe, we take it, are numerous, and roar, “Give ms,’
whenever they see Bodger’s Beer. Send us a bottle or
two and we’ll tell you if the bard was singing the truth.
(P S.—You might have sent a bottle with your letter.)
.... Bulger : Yes, we’ve groaned over it frequently our-
selves. Glad to hear your groan, although we can’t print
it. Later on, when people take hold of the idea, we’ll
all groan together; and it will be such a spacious and
terrifying groan that someone will simply have to take
notice....L.O.(Melb.): Useless stuff 0.0. P. (M.L.):
Poem too long and jolty. Yarns have some fairl.v good
descriptive patches, but are below par otherwise
Learner : Both unsuitable.. .Ossian (Q.): Story gets along
about as rapidly as a serpent on an Antarctic expedi-
tion... .G.B. A. (V.): Verses about the curse of the Cow
are neither smooth-flowing nor vigorous... .T.L. : You
sing in your blithesome way:
Now I can no longer wander
Over hills and vales and streams ;
Still my thoughts take me out yonder,
And I journey in my dreams.
Well, it’s safer than travelling in one of Tait’s trains
and no one ever drops luggage on your feet .K. M<;K.
(V.): Both unsuitable. MS. returned... Slowheart :
Whirling item re a well-known piece of sculpture gladly
rejected - . Verses likewise. No name or address on MS.
Did you write them whilst running for a. train?....
H.J.L. : Alleged poem about Australia is a frightful
bellow, and we refuse to lend you our “passive ear.”
You did well to be timid about submitting it. Your
timidity is the only extenuating circumstance
Nomad: A promising jingle with a few discords..!!
Henry 0. : We are deeply grateful to you, Henrv, and
the poem shall rest next our heart until it (the poem) is
worn out. Our old chest-protector was about done,
an.vwa.v.. .L.L. K.: “ The Scotchwoman’s Dying Lament”
is marred by several shrieks and a grievous lack of
rhymes. The political rhyme, “ Knocking at the Door,”
has been admitted—to the basket Chine: A feeble
effort Marcus: You don’t know the ABC of what you
are so cocksure about. The purpose of a praduated
land-tax, with an exemption, is to break up big estates ;
the purpose of a land-tax without exemption is t 6 get
back into the public’s pocket the value which the public
has given to land. And, as Fisher’s tax is a graduated
tax with an exemption (a breaking-up tax), Tub
Bulletin said, and sa.vs again, that it is the wrong
instrument to use on city lands. When you
start to break up a “big estate” two yards
wide the position savors of the ridiculous!
Katanning : All right. Schumann isn’t a has-been. Space
is too scarce to argue that point Misi: Can’t reprint.
G.W. : Try the Under-Sec., Works Department
A.J.C. : A matter of taste ; you might just as well ask us
to settle which is best—beer, or boots or sausages
G.F.E.: “How old is Nellie Stewart?” Dunno. She
used to be 17. \
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC) CONTRIBUTORS.
11.C.N. : The drawing is worse than the joke, and the
joke is worse than everything else in the world except the
drawing....H.D. : The picture shows a sad lack of in-
genuity... Kol: That “Christian name’’joke arose in
the days of the Pharisees. None of the others of any
special account Jack L.: Whether there are Any new
deadbeats and deadbeat jokes or whether they are all
just one old deadbeat in different rags and one old
joke in different guise, we know not. The question
has been referred to the geological department
Knight: “The Twins” is stupid and unpleasant; and
what on earth is “ Domestacy? ” GfiarlesSw, W. : A
dismally foolish picture. You simply shoyT Wade in
prison, which is just as much to thepointas if rod showed
him in church, or Thibet, or holy orders, or a rage, or
in any other old circumstance R. Ellis: The partially-
filled copper is a jest of the ’47 vintage... .A.F.: There is
presumably a meaning in your picture of nigger woman
with golf apparatus, but it isn’t easy to trace Alf. K.:
H your picture had shown them kicking the umpire there
might have been some life in it. A mere view of a man
and a woman, and a footnote setting forth that the man
is asking the woman if she noticed the umpire being
kicked, has nb violent movement in it, so to speak....
Geo. W. : The small girl used to ask her maiden auntifshe
hadrbeen in the ark. By way of wild originality, you show
her asking her grandfather. ,
Melbourne has heard nothing more from
its pressihhout the marriage which didn’t eventu-
ate-at <i -Richmond tabernacle the other week.
The banns had been called three times, and a
noble wedding breakfast was spread in a local
Hall “ tastefully decorated for the occasion.” A
professional pianist waited at the hall, and a
parson (also professional) waited at the church,
together with the bride and numerous friends of
the contracting parties. But the bridegroom
never turned up. It was not lack of love that
kept him away, for lie wrote next morning to the
bride stating that he was unable to proceed with
the wedding because be could not borrow enough
money to meet the expenses. The letter con-
cluded with Try and forget me.—Your loving
Jack.” As it was obviously impossible for the
lady to forget a lover who had gone broke on the
attempt to marry her in style, The Bulletin
hopes that they found a cheap issue out of all their
afflictions. Here was a bridegroom whose inten-
tions were more than merely honorable. Thev
were heroic.

They are ploughs of positively the highest quality—nothing better can be purchased at
any price.
Prices we quote are below those at which inferior ploughs are sold, and are well worth

Alcock Billiard
Tables excel.
Consult any competent judge of billiard tables, and he’ll
promptly tell you that there are no tables equal to “Alcock’s.”
Many of the leading billiard matches have' been played on
these tables —the recent match between George Gray and Fred
Lindrum, jun., when Gray scored 836, 831 coining off the red,,
thus establishing two world’s records, and for which Gray
received a gold medal, is an example. This score is another
proof of the marvellous accuracy and perfect construction of
our billiard tables.
Each table is fitted with Imperial Low Cushions, and
bears our trade mark.

As Melbourne Argus remarked anent its

monwealth.” That is to say, 241 newspapers
voiced their disapproval of the dreadful Yass-

sites, Dalgety, with 99 votes, led by streets. And
now, how about the allegedly democratic Fisher
txovernment letting the country pronounce on
this urgent question in similar fashion ? Does it
rear the answer the people may give, or what,?

INDIGESTION
AND LIVER TROUBLE.
Sickened at Sight of Food—Prostrated by Violent
Vomiting Grew to a Shadow.
MY restoration to health by Bile Beans,
after all other medicines had dismally
failed to give me even temporary
relief, has amazed me,” says Mrs. C. Lee,
aged 72 years, living at Cowper Street, Gran-
ville, near Sydney.
borne twelve years ago,” she continues, “ I became a
martyr to indigestion and liver complaint. The agony I
suffered was terrible. I lost all inclination for food—the
very sight of it making me ill—and even if I did manage
to eat a mouthful my stomach would not retain it; so I
used to practically starve myself, because I got that way
that I thought it was useless trying to eat at all, and I
soon wasted away to a mere shadow. Then I would be
prostrated by violent fits of vomiting, in the course of
which I would eject large quantities of bile.
I tried all sorts of so-called remedies, but, notwith-
doctoring T*Tmder-
went, I gained no relief. I did not know what to do
next my case seemed absolutely hopeless.
_. It was at this time that I happened to come across
Bile Beans. My daughter, reading of a case very
similar to my own which Bile Beans had cured, strongly
urged me to give them a trial as a last resource. I took
her ad vi ce and i mmed i a tel y com men ced taking Bileßeans.
1 took two of the Beans every night, and was so astonished at the good I derived from
n 1 d ,T ded to undergo a thorough course, as I felt sure that at last I had the medi-
cine that would cure me. Ihe sickness and vomiting lessened and quickly left me, the terrible

The Portrait.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
SHE was a Lady, tall and fair,
And ripe of charms, and neatly laced;
Her upper half was like a pear
In shape, and tapered to her waist;
And she had bright eyes, like a cat,
That you could light a candle at.
She had the Dian poise of head,
But her sweet mouth was soft and fresh—
No Dian, but a white-and-red
Gray challenge from thegoddess Flesh
Was she. Who takes such challenge up
On sweets shall dine, on bitters sup.
She kept a wine-shop—keeps it yet—
And with it kept her virtue, too ;
I or she was—though a born coquette—
Unto her absent husband true.
He had, it seemed, gone forth in quest
Of Fortune— somewhere in the West.
His portrait framed—a work of art 1—
Behind the bar in glory hung !
And, if she ever felt her heart
Beat quicker to a wooing tongue,
One glance upon that picture kept
Her colder than a catalept.
It showed a man with mouth that seemed
A scarf made by a crosscut saw.
And eyes that ominously gleamed,
And huge, clean-shaven iron jaw—
A man, indeed, that you would shun
io biff upon the jaw in fun.
One day to drink the siren’s wine,
A young man came, with gallant air.
His smile was gay, his eyes were fine ;
And he was dark as she was fair.
He looked the picture of a bran’-
New London Journal nobleman.
He called for Burgundy—the best—
And pledged her health and kissed her hand,
And said she looked her loveliest,
And held, his heart at her command ;
In truth he had a tempting tongue,
ivnd made her feel she still was young.
He vowed that if she held in jest
His love he’d go and die alone ;
And take, some night, from her cold,breast
Her heart for his memorial stone.
“For it is hard as stone,” said he ;
Then murmured : “Dearest! fly with me!”
•She swayed to him as .sways a tall,
White lily filled with morning dew,
Then at the portrait on the wall
An inadvertent glance she threw.
“ Who is that ogre, love ? ” said he.
“ My husband !” faintly murmured she.
4 Thank Heav’n ! ” she cried when he had fled.
“ I never came so near a fall—
The portrait helped me keep my head—
And all’s well that ends well for all. . . .
And yet ...” She climbed a ladder tall
And turned the portrait to the wall.
CREEVE ROE.
The Utter Absurdity of Jorkins.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
XRISE to protest against Jorkins. I
call the attention of the authorities to the
utter absurdity of Jorkins and his unreason-
able prosperity. I demand, as a ratepayer, that
Jorkins be proclaimed extinct and suppressed
without further loss of time.
These are my reasons. Jorkins lives opposite,
and in the summer evenings he walks up and
down the verandah in a round smoking-cap with
a gold tassel and sings the baby to sleep. As far
as I can make out. the baby is Jorkins’s finest
achievement to date. It appears to be a genuine
baby, and all the neighbors say it is a fine child.
lam glad to hear it. I am glad to think that
Jorkins has something pertaining to him which is
not absurd. So far as 1 am concerned, the baby
represents the one extenuating circumstance in
the case of Jorkins v. Common Sense. When I
hear it yell in the night I know that Jorkins’s sole
excuse for living is still going strong. But I
object strenuously to his singing it to sleep, and
in such garb. Attired as he always is on these
occasions, and engaged in the most touching
parental duty that ever falls to the lot of man,
he represents the acme of respectability and the
top note of domestic duty. These things should
never be visible to the naked eye. Jorkins
should retire to the yard.
Then he is always mending the roof. Every
man has a vice. Most men drink. Jorkins
inends the roof. When I drink I have the
pleasure and endure the headache. When Jor-
kins crawls up a ladder and bashes his roof for
two hours he has the pleasure and other 1 people
get the headache. Jorkins’s roof can’t possibly
need all the hammering it gets—it couldn’t be
sufficiently broken even if a herd of camels danced
on it twice a day.
Jorkins works in the Customs and gets an ab-
surdly large salary for scratching hieroglyphics in
red ink on certain specified forms. It appears
that Jorkins is the Comptroller (I never can
make out what that “p” is for) of Flotsam
and Jetsam, and everything that is washed up
or down, or tossed up or down, or anything that
is washed into the sea or out of the sea, all these
things have to be “passed” by Jorkins.
“Passing,” in this instance, doesn’t mean that
Jorkins has to rush past it, or even drive past in
a cab. It only means that Jorkins sits in a sump-
tuous office and says in a severe voice : “Do you
swear to this?’ And whoever it is answers in a
respectful tone: “Yes, Mr. Jorkins.” And then
Jorkins puts some absurd marks on it and looks
as if he had done some hard work. The amazing
thing about it is that the people who go in there
take Jorkins seriously and treasure the idiotic
scratches he makes on their papers, and whenever
he is in a bad humor he is frightfully strict, and
refuses to “initial”—he calls it “initialling”—
anything, unless the clerks—who get on the aver-
age 30s. per week—swear to everything and ren-
der themselves liable to a fine of £lO,OOO or
imprisonment for 40 years if they happen to be
wrong. On these occasions the Customs House is
the centre of a disturbance which sweeps the
whole city and causes untold misery—and the cause
of it may have been a misdirected blow by .Torkins
when on one of his roof-banging orgies the night
before.
He comes home in the same train as I do now
and then, and on these occasions he tells me the
famous story of how he collected duty on the 30
dozen pairs of Assyrian tadpoles imported by the
Minister of Fireworks and presented by him to
the State Government to stock the Parliamentary
fish-ponds. .Torkins didn’t go to the enormous
amount of trouble necessary to collect thst 3s. 4d.
out of pure patriotism. No, he spent about £583
worth of his own and other officials’ time, and
made an enemy for life of the Minister of
Fireworks, out of sheer perversity. If you
will look up the newspaper files of 1906 (you
won’t do anything of the sort if you’ve got any
sense, because the thing isn’t worth it) you will
see what a storm of controversy arose over
Jorkins’s little fit of officiousness. Throughout
the correspondence Jorkins is alluded to variously
as “ the Comptroller of Flotsam and Jetsam,”
“a high official in H. M. Customs,” “a certain
officer in the Department of Customs,” etc.
Jorkins has it all pasted carefully in a scrap-book,
and when he shows it to you and laughs fatuously,
you long to batter him over the head with it and
slay him with his own lunacy.
_ It may seem unjust, but not only do I dislike
Jorkins, but I dislike his relations and friends—
even the callers who only visit at long intervals..
Jorkins s friends and relations and acquaintances
all give the impression of being stuffed. Usually
they come on Sunday afternoons in helltoppers
and frock coats, silks, satins, feathers and furs.
Every one of them appears to be absurdly
prosperous. The men hold on to expensive walk-
ing sticks, and the women hold up their clothes
with both hands to keep them from dragging in
the dust. Then Jorkins holds the gate open for
them, and Mrs. Jorkins holds up her jewelled
hands in ecstasy, and says it’s “too sweet” of
them (Mrs. Jorkins says it’s “too sweet” of
them; but to me it looks rather as if it
were “too fat” of them)—“too sweet” of
them “to come all that way!” Certainly,
it would be a dashed sight better if they only
came half-way and then repented and went home;
but they never do. Instead, they arrive punc-
tually in all their inane pomp and drivelling
circumstance, and make poor but honest, people
skulk behind their blighted hedges and exchange
whatever cheap sarcasms their scattered wits can
command. I shudder regularly every Sunday
afternoon at the moral devastation wrought among
the young married couples by the passing of
Jorkins’s bloated friends. The wife thinks: “ Will
poor Harry—who works so hard—ever have a
glittering belltopper like the one on that great
fat brute?” Or : “ Will Harry ever be able to give
me a dress half as good as the one on that fearfully
fat woman?” Then, with a sudden tightening of the
pretty lips: “Oh well, I suppose we ought to be
very thankful we’re so fond of each other—
and all that; but Lord knows it does seem
hard that we have to try and muddle along
on about tuppence a week when people
like that ”—and so on and so forth, until the
beautiful afternoon has waned, and it’s time to
go in and get tea, or do something for the precious
and inevitable baby. I say emphatically that I
can see all this misery with the naked eye, and I
have called down more curses—l don’t know
whether they will arrive, but, at any rate, I have
called them down—on Jorkins’s friends than they
will ever be able to keep off with their expensive
umbrellas and ostrich feathers.
While on the subject of ostrich feathers. Every
time I see Mrs. Fred Jorkins, the thought strikes
me with fresh force : “ What a sin it was to rob
one of God’s creatures of its outer covering in
order that a fat but honest woman might be made
a monstrosity ! ” I can’t decide in my own mind
who gets the worst of that deal. Sometimes I
think the Ostrich can’t possibly look as bad with-
out the feathers as Mrs. Fred does ivith them, and
then I think that if the ostrich does look as bad as
Mrs. Fred he ought to ask a friend to kick
him on the ear and have done with it all. When-
ever I think of hot, dusty men, in lonely places,
risking their lives and insulting overgrown fowls
by dragging their exterior adornments off them,
with the aim of afterwards selling same to fat
women of uncertain age, I am filled with suspicion
and gloom.
Mr. Fred Jorkins is Jorkins’s elder brother.
He is very high up in the Lands, and sends out
enormous printed letters with the Government
coat-of-arms on top. These he signs: “I have
the honor to be your obedient servant, Frederick
Jorkins, Secretary.” Of course, Fred Jorkins is
nobody’s “obedient servant,” and, if you want to
see him—l say if you want to see him : but
you never do “ want.” What I meant to say was
“if you have to see him.” Well, if you have to
see him, you generally have to kick your heels
about the Department for a day or so. and then
crawl into the sacred presence on your hands and
knees. That's the sort of “obedient servant”
Fred Jorkins is. Naturally enough, he gets an
enormous salary for doing whatever absurd thing
he does, and his name is reverenced from one end
of the Government offices to the other. The
ordinary clerk of whom you ask the way in some
lonely corridor says, in a surprised tone :“ See
Mr. Jorkins ! I’m afraid you’ll have some diffi-
culty. Have you left your name with anyone?”
You exclaim in amazement: “ Left my name !
Is it necessary to leave my name ? ”
“ Oh, yes ! ”
“ With whom shall I leave it?”
“ Oh, V wearily, “leave it with anyone! Give
it to one of the messengers ! ”
“ What happens then ?”
“Well, then they take it in to Mr. Jorkins.”
“ And what does he do with it ?”
“Mr. Jorkins, sir. will then probably write
you and make an appointment for such and such
a day at such and such a time.”
You seize the clerk as he endeavors to hurry
past you, and ask hurriedly: “ But what necessity
is there for all that trouble when I am just out-
side his door now ? ”
The official looks at you in disgust, and says,
“My dear sir, we simply can't do things like
that! If Mr. .Torkins saw people indiscrimin-
ately, I don’t think he would ever get through !”
Whereupon he makes his escape, and you are left
wondering savagely what sort of vacancy it is
Jorkins is struggling to get through, and if it
really matters whether he gets through or just
stays where he is.
My Jorkins (I only use the possessive pronoun
to distinguish him from his brother Fred. He
doesn’t in any sense belong to me. I don’t want
him.) has latterly organised a male quartet party.
It is composed of himself, his brother Fred, a bri-
gand called Pudgelv from the Department of Mari-
time Fogs and a tall man called Dodgewick, who
is Comptroller of Tides and Soundings, and has an
irritating habit of clearing his throat as if
he had surprised someone doing something awful
and wanted to warn him not to let it happen

Do you know that
Rheumatism, Dropsy,
Gravel, Stone, Lum-

kidney diseases ? The
kidneys when healthy
filter the blood ; when
weak or diseased they
cannot do their work,
and the whole body
suffers. Only a special kidney medicine can cure
them. Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills are a kidney medi-
cine and a Kidney Medicine only. They keep the kidneys
well, and the kidneys will keep you well. ke D ltUed
kidney disease is fatal.
Sydney People Cured.
A Sydney Man.
Mr. W. R. Francis, plasterer. 111 Arundel Street, Forest Lodge,
Sydney, says :—“ I suffered with severe backache ; the pain was just over
the kidneys. I was so bad that when I managed to stoop down, it was
almost impossible to get my back straight again, and every movemen
increased the pain, and I had to knock off work. A friend advised me to
use Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, saying they had cured him, and he was
so earnest that I got some. I used two boxes and can safely say that iam
cured. I advise all who suffer with backache to get Doan s
Kidney Pills. I feel no pain now, and can stoop without any trouble.
Six years later, when asked about his cure, Mr. Francis says les,
l am still free of backache, and have never suffered since Doan s Backache
Kidney Pills cured me, four years ago. It’s no fool of a medicine that will
cure like that.”
A Sydney Woman.
Mrs. E. A. Bruce, Broughton Road, Artarmon, Sydney, says :—*‘l
suffered for a long time with severe pains in my back. They were so bad
that I could scarcely move about. Rest was out of the question. I would
be tossing about all night, moaning with the pain. I could not bend my
back, and I had to neglect my work. I was really very ill, and would be
confined to bed for days at a time. I saw Doan s Backache Kidney Puls
advertised as a cure for backache, and procured a box. After a few doses I
got relief, and then gradually I got better, until I was quite cured.”
Four years later, Mrs. Bruce says : —“ Doan s Backache Kidney Pills
cured me of backache four years ago, and I have been free of this ailment
ever since.”
DOAN’S BACKACHE KIDNEY PILLS are sold by all Chemists and Store-
keepers at 2s. 9d. per bottle (six bottles, 15s. 3d.), or will be posted on receipt of
price by Foster-McClellan Co., 76 Pitt Street, Sydney.

BACKACHE KIDNEY PILLS
ECZEMA.
A LITTLE GIRL’S LASTING CURE.
Mrs. A. M. Horwitz, 48 Baptist Street,
Redfern, Sydney, says : —“I sent for a
pot of Doan’s Ointment, and used it for
Eczema on my little girl’s forehead.
The rash covered the brow completely,
and it was round the eye as well. The
itching was frightful, making her very
fretful, and keeping her from sleeping,
which made it hard on all of us. I had
used several preparations previous to
getting Doan’s Ointment, but none of
them gave more than passing relief. I
am pleased to tell you that Doan’s Oint-
ment cured her completely. We have
since used it on another little girl with
equally good results. Doan’s Ointment
is splendid, and I advise its use in all
itching skin diseases. It gave instan-
taneous relief, and healed rapidly.”
Six years later, Mrs. Horwitz says :
“My little girl is still right. Shelias
been cured six years now. The doctor
who treated her said the eczema would
return every winter ; but he was wrong,
as time has proved. Since I made the
above statement a lady visitor from New
Zealand used Doan’s Ointment for
Eczema on her hand, and it cured her
also.” Doan’s Ointment is sold by all
chemists and storekeepers at 2s. 9d. per
pot, or will be posted on receipt of price
by Foster-McClellan Co., 76 Pitt Street,
Sydney.
But be sure you get DOAN’S.
again. It is an infuriating mannerism, and after
he has done it twice I feel that I want to throttle
him. Why Jorkins wants to arrange these three
stodgy men and himself shoulder to shoulder in a
fat bulgy row, and then get all to groan together,
is a thing that passes my comprehension. One
man of that sort by himself is bad enough, Heaven
knows; but when four of them join forces and
solemnly perform absurd part songs, the surround-
ing atmosphere is a perfect blaze of dullness.
Jorkins always asks me in to these festivals and
insists on my going. If I’m not there by the time
they are ready to start the idiocy, he comes across
the road and shouts : “ Come on, old man—we’re
only -waiting for you ! ” And then I have to drop
my paper and accompany him.
Mrs. Fred always officiates at the piano.
.Torkins’s wife sits on the sofa and admires Jorkins.
Jorkins edges up close to the other three fools and
waves a podgy, freckled hand thrice in the air.
“ One—two—three 1 ” he says, and then the four
of them shout this :
“ Away! Away ! A bandit I would be !
“ Away 1 Away ! A bandit bo-hold and free 1"
(Jorkins, loudly): “ And free 1 ”
“ A bandit.bo-hold and free 1”
(Jorkins, loudly): “And free !”
“ Yes, that is the life for me ! ”
(Jorkins, loudly): “For me !”
“ Yes, that is the life for me ! ”
(Jorkins, loudly): “ For me 1 ” {lmagine Jorkins !)
(All together): “ Yes—that—is—the—ufe—for—me—
HK—HE 1 ”
And while they’re shouting how they’d like to be
bandits, they look like a group of old fat drakes
quacking in a fowl-yard. The only difference is
that you can eat the drakes, but the law unjustly
forbids you to even kill people who sing part
songs.
I don’t know whether Jorkins really wants to
be a bandit and thinks he and his three accom-
plices would be successful as bandits, or whether
he merely sings that particular part song because
it suits something that he says is his voice. In
any case, I hate to hear a fat man utter revolu-
tionary sentiments in a loud voice ; but when four
fat men repeat them over and over again in
unison, and then go back to the start and divide
the labor, arranging it so that two of them are
shouting the end of the statement while the other
two are shouting the beginning, I want to get up
and curse.
I don’t know what is to be the end of Jorkins.
I don’t know that he deserves an end. If he has
any hopes or ambitions that are not absurd, he
has never mentioned them to me. The man and
everything pertaining to him is utterly prepos-
terous. All except the baby. lam no authority
on babies, but its yell seems to me to be a good,
healthy, human yell, and not in the least absurd.
I think it is written that Jorkins shall work out
his salvation by raising a real human being
quite unlike himself. That, however, is merely
my theory; and, of course, I may be wrong.
Time alone will show. In the meantime, Jorkins
continues to be utterly absurd.
KODAK.
The Oldest Name in the World.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
f sun blazes over Flemington. There
I is scarce breeze enough to stir the elm
leaves that shade the paddock, and the
gilded rooster that sits on the top of the scratch-
ing-board is heavy with sleep. On the Flat there
is no shade, and its heterogeneous crowd runs
hither and thither among the bookmakers, like
ants among cherry-stones. I have attached myself
to the clientele of a gentleman in a long red coat,
who stands upon a kind of stool and politely
hands out tickets in exchange for silver coins of
all values. His unruffled calm captivates me.
He preserves a studied mien of gracious uncon-
cern that is mixed with an indefinable air of
hauteur and modishness, hiding, I am half-
tempted to suspect, a measure of contempt for
his patrons. He succeeds in wearing with perfect
dignity a deplorable top hat, a little on one side,
with a shabby-colored ribbon tied round it. His
age might be anything at all, though I can make
a shrewd guess at it from the fact that his clerk,
who does all the shouting, is obviously his son.
By this I judge that he must be 50 or more,
though of the two the son shows more obvious
traces of wear and tear.
As the bookmaker hands out each card he
accompanies it with the faintest inclination—the
very ghost of a bow—that conveys the idea that
it is the remains of a completer salutation, some-
thing infinitely more courteous and prolonged,
that could only find its full expression in the
elaborate and unhurried ceremonial of Asia. His
name is displayed on the well-worn bag that
hangs round his shoulders. It is an Asiatic name
—a name that has been heard on the quays
of the Phcenicians, in the courts of the
Pharaohs, in the market places of buried cities,
in the halting places of the grey caravans of
the desert. It is one of the oldest names in the
world ; older than the Pyramids. A splendid
name, that brings with it to the ear an echo of
the wanderings of Ulysses, the chivalry of
Damascus, and the rich background of Arabian
romance. His face has a natural repose, and the
skin a beautiful golden olive that no sun can tan.
His eyes protrude and the lids are heavy. His
teeth gleam like ivory from under the heavy
moustache that sweeps up with a grand curve
from below the jawbone, and which, heavy though
it is, cannot quite hide the thickness of .the sensu-
ous lips. His utterance is slow and musical. His
English is good and free from accent, save for a
certain juiciness in the sibilants.
It is growing hotter and hotter, and I place my
handkerchief under my hat, for my brains are
beginning to bubble. The crowd becomes more
unreal every minute. The Flat stretches away in
the shimmering, dancing heat to an illimitable
distance. The new sand-track shines white across
it. The distance grows more distant. The after-
noon sleeps. I pinch myself and try to realise
that one comes to Flemington to back horses,
not to dream, and that if a bet is to be made
something must be done about it soon, or the
whole fabric will melt away into the summer
haze, and I shall be swept up along with the torn
tickets and the orange-peel in the morning.
But the spell of Asia is upon me. Those
silky tones are in my ear, calling the names of
horses —“Nushka,” “Salvia,” “Daisy Chain.”
The fascinating personality still holds me by
impalpable fetters, and I watch him as he deftly
writes his tickets, his head and shoulders firmly
outlined against the grey blue sky. The singular
ability- of the man strikes me afresh. I can feel
tffe >acial individuality that marks him as the
descendant of a long line of men to whom many
centuries. have given familiarity with all the
subtleties of the world’s markets, and who have
taken all risks as they came, smiling uncon-
cernedly. These were the men who originally
constituted themselves the world’s purveyors of
luxuries. Their ship 3 touched at all sea-boards,
and wherever they touched they had goods to
offer that set men’s mouths a-watering. They
chaffered with the pock-marked idol-sellers of
Joppa, offering them lumps of/clouded amber as
big as turkey’s eggs, which fingers of northern
women had groped for in the deep sand dunes of
some Baltic island, and which they had exchanged
for the dainty filigrees of Ispahan. Theirs were
those long trains of “camels that bear spices and
very much gold and precious stones,’’ sun- and
star-led across the Arabian desert, setting their
burdens down at last beside the pylons of
Memphis, where delicate Egyptian hands received
them and subtle Egyptian brains computed their
equivalent. It was to them, too, and their lateen
sails, that jaded transpontine Sultans looked for
fresh beauties to replenish their seraglios. In
bronzes, jewels, wines and silks their taste had
satisfied emperors. They had always been recog-
nised appraisers of the world’s loveliness. From
the cutting of a cameo to the turn of a dancing-
girl’s ankle their verdict was final. Their influ-
ence, too, had stood for culture in many lands.
Their comings and goings had standardised
canons of taste over wide areas, and although
their motives had always been commercial, still
they had strictly upheld those standards, and so
identified themselves with the march of civilisa-
tion and refinement.
It was a hard job to remember all this, and at
the same time to justify that crimson coat, that
unlovely hat, and that bag that bulged with our
homely silver pieces. The odor of the multitude
assailed my nostrils, and I regretted the “spices”
—particularly the spices—“and very much gold
and precious stones.” I regretted, too, the man’s
unmistakable power turned to such sad account,
when so many walks of life are calling for talent
to lift them from their dead level of mediocrity.
As these thoughts left me a door of the mind
seemed to open, and instantly I slipped through
and found myself in an older and more colorsoiqe
world. His mountebank vestments changed them-
selves to Asiatic robes of ceremony, and a many-
folded turban replaced the hat of shame. Flem-
ington receded, and an oasis on the edge of the
desert took its place. The white sand training-
track stretched out from horizon to horizon, and
I knew it for the ancient route of caravans that
has been whitened in course of centuries by the
bleached bones of the dead and countless camels.
The elms turned easily to date palms, and the
dusty lines of the betting ring to the crowded
arcades of the slave market. He was calling the
names of girls with the same smooth tongue tha,t
is at home in all languages, only this time' it was
in Arabic that he called : “ Salvia ! ” “ Nushka !’’
“Daisy Chain !” “Dainty maidens all of them,
and at prices to suit all pockets. Who’ll buy ?’’
The crowd surged round him, jabbering com-
ments. I caught his eye. “ Nushka ?” I asked,
smitten by the name. He bowed—and the re-
sidual bow had got back all its original beauty
and completeness.
“Thirty-three pieces of twelve, illustrious
Roumi. Never will you regret it. See, I sign
the transfer. The honorable bargain is complete.”
And with another bow he accepted my silver and
handed me the piece of parchment. It bore a
mystic number, and in Arabic characters the
maiden’s name and price, and underneath it was
that name—the name on t)ie bag ; the name that
is older than the Pyramids ; the name of him who
counted the gold pieces into the hands of the sons
of Jacob when they sold their brother Joseph into
bondage in Egypt years and years ago.
BLAMIRE YOUNG.
The Whare by the Sea.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
FAR away across the distance in the land I
left behind me,
Where the north-bound seas go punching
through the narrow-funnelled Strait,
There’s a white bay round the headland where
the surf goes rolling blindly,
And the winds from southern icefields wail and
cry disconsolate.
Just above the line of breakers, on the hillside,
stands a whare—
A little lean-to shanty by a lonely cabbage-
tree—
And to-night the city frets me, and I’m sad and
sick and sorry.
I wish that I was back there in the whare by
the sea.
I can see the rough meal waiting; I can smell
the ti-tree burning ;
The rain-beat on- the window makes me think
of flying spray—
Makes me crave for broken water. I can hardly
stay the yearning
To be flogging out the whaleboat through the
breakers in the bay—
Cursing, soaking, bailing gallons, with her nose
to old Penearrow
(The light that keeps its eye upon the storm’s
conspiracy),
With the wind’s edge like a razor cutting inward
to the marrow.
I wish that I was back again to fight that bitter
sea ;
Or sitting round the fireplace made of tin and
white clay packing.
Burning fencing-posts we’d lifted from the
sheep-run on the hills,
Singing rough-and-ready chanteys to a concertina
cracking
With the strain of doing double shifts of tune
and fancy, trills.
No sleep shall come to me to-night, nor yet again
to-morrow —
I’m restless for those other days, the wild days
and the free;
But I could bridge the barren years, and turn
from fret and sorrow
In the fern-filled bunk that’s empty in the
whare by the sea.
With the boom of water crashing down where
Barrett’s Reef lies hidden—
A boom of steadied cadence like a mournful
minute gun ;
With maddened wind-gusts crying past like lost
souls devil-ridden —
I could sleep as sleep the bush birds at the set-
ting of the sun.
Time could pass me and forget me in that white
bay round the headland,
In the little lean-to shanty by the lonely cab-
bage-tree ;
Someone else can take my place here in this
foolish, citied Deadland —
My heart is aching, aching for the whare by the
sea. '
N.S.W,
J. B.

A friend insisted that I should
try Ayer’s Sarsaparilla. After I
had taken about half a bottle
my appetite got better and I be-
gan to be quite light-hearted. I
was quite well and strong before
I had finished the sixth bottle,
but to make sure I took in all
eight bottles.”
R. T. Moore,
Adelaide.
AYER’S Sarsaparilla
makes the blood rich in red corpuscles, thereby imparting to it new life-
giving power. Begin taking it at once. Day after day you will slowly
but steadily feel yourself growing stronger and stronger.
As now made, Ayer’s Sarsaparilla contains no alcohol.
There are many imitation Sarsaparillas that will disappoint
you. Get “AYER’S.” ,

Just try one or two Cockle’s Pills. They will give a fillip to the
