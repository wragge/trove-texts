THE RED PAGE
Getting nearer to the real thing is the
italicised reversolet, in which, while the words
and punctuation and the meaning remain the.
same in the reversing part, some variation of
meaning is gained by emphasising certain
words by italics or exclamation points. As
thus :
The true reversolet, however, depends not
only on the reversal of the lines, but on a
reversal, or variation, of the meaning. And
in this class there are two divisions : the
classic and the casual. The classic reversolet
repeats exactly the words of the first portion,
but by varying the punctuation or stressing
certain words achieves a surprise—which is
as much the essence of the reversolet as of
the triolet—-by a change in meaning while
preserving the written form. The casual
reversolet is allowed greater latitude, thus
departing from the triolet, and by a slight
variation of (preferably) one line achieves
the unexpected. The classic form is the
more difficult to do ; the casual allows a
greater contrast in meaning. Both forms, it
seems, are permissible. “ Ganesha ” ad-
mirably attempts a definition :
“H. C. McKay, the Astronomer-Poet of
South Melbourne, has earned the thanks of
all mankind for his invention of the beautiful
Reversolet. As Petrarch is associated with
the Sonnet, Arnaud with the Sestina,
Villon with the Ballade, so will the McKay
be famed hereafter as the discoverer of the
Southern Cross and the inventor of the
Reversolet. At the same time, his rules, as
laid down on the ‘Red Page,’ are not
explicit. In the ‘ long ’ form, he states,
‘ there are eight lines before reversion, and
the ‘middle’ is omitted.’ This is clumsy
and misleading. There are fifteen lines in
this form, seven reversed, with a ‘ middle ’
that is the very kernel of the poem. In the
‘ short ’ form, called, I believe, the ‘ Oyster-
lette,’ he permits the ‘middle’ to be in
longer metre, if preferred, which, though
convenient for weak rhymsters to make clear
their idea, destroys the harmony of the
verse. The point of the Reversolet is to
glide, like a waltzer, gracefully round the
turn ; the walls of the ballroom should not
fee shifted because a bad dancer has difficulty
in turning the metrical corner. That is a
poor Reversolet in which each line is com-
plete in itself and can be shuffled anywhere
without hurt. The lines should group
differently in the ‘reverse.’ This necessitates
a change in punctuation, which is not a fault,
but an added beauty. Since the Reversolet
'has won the approval of Bulletin bards (one
example was a shorter form, a ‘ Sdmi-
Oysterlette ’), it is a pity McKay has not
detailed the rules with more precision.”
And of verse definitions there are plenty.
So let us lay down rules :
1. The division into long and short, into
the oysterlette and the whale, is not needed.
A reversolet can be of any length, provided
the latter half repeats the first half back-
ward.
2. “Ganesha’s” objection to the long
middle line is justified. There is no reason
why the middle line should exceed the
metrical allowance for the rest of the poem ;
it is only an inducement to carelessness, as
is exemplified by the effort made to com-
press two running lines into one, as in John
Fearn’s definition quoted.
3. The middle line must not be repeated.
4. As to rimes, the middle line must rime
with some other line.
5. The number of rimes allowed in the
reversolet should not be large. Certainly no
more than two rimes should be permitted in
a reversolet of 11 lines, while for the longer
reversolet a good working rule would be that
no more than three rimes should be allowed
for one of 15 lines. The reversolet, like the
triolet, the rondeau, the ballade, the sonnet,
gains immeasurably by this economy of
sounds.
6. The meaning must vary in the latter
half.
7. In the classic reversolet this variation
of meaning may be effected by a variation of
punctuation or of emphasis.
8. In the casual reversolet the variation
can be managed by slight changes in wording.
9. The ideal reversolet is one in which the
change in the meaning occurs only in the
last line. It is the delayed denouement of
the plot, and after that the curtain must be
quickly dropped.
It will thus be seen that there is a special
ingenuity necessary for the construction of
this verse-form. This hint to reversoletteers
may be of value. Construct your lines in por-
tions, each of which can be joined either to the
preceeding or succeeding line, or so that the
two portions can be read as one complete
line, and in the reverse separated. As an
example of this method, the following may
be cited :
IN MEMORIAM, JOHN HENRY SMITH.
(Inventor of the Reversolet.)
He wrote one small reversolet. Too much
The fame it brought him, for they hanged him
high—
A convict with his Muse in leg-irons ! Such
Who dared a ruler’s ermined robe to touch
With ribaldry, they had, perforce, to die !
Authority could not such stinging bees defy
With ribaldry. They had, perforce, to die.
Who dared a ruler’s ermined robe to touch ?
A convict with his Muse in leg-irons ! —such
The fame it brought him, for they hanged him
high !
He wrote one small reversolet too much.
A.H.A.
There were 151 reversolets sent in, includ-
ing a blank verse reversolet, and this de-
lightful ruin of a reversolet by a competitor
whose big batch was of high merit :
The following specimens in the classic
form are worth reproduction :
Don’t kiss me, Len !
No ! No ! —‘ ‘ 1 love you ?”so !
And must you also go
Silly, like other men ? ,
I love you not ! —and then?—
Silly ! like other men
And must you also go ?
No! No! I love-you so,
Don’t! Kiss me, Len !

“ Now,” said the meanest man on earth,
“I’ll shout yer all a drink ;
I’ll stand yer all a fat cigar,
What does yez fellows think
O’ that ! ” They laughed in scorn, “ Ha, ha ! ”
“ What l does yez fellows think
I’ll stand yer all a fat cigar,
I’ll shout yer all a drink
Now ? ” said the meanest man on earth.
- Percy.
It has been found necessary to divide the
niggardly prize between two. specimens—one
in the classic style and the other in the
casual. R. G. Worthley, Gulnare, S. Aus.,
wins half-a-guinea with :
While E. O. Rowland, High-street, Sandy
Bay, Hobart, scores with his neat specimen
of the casual reversolet :
I bowed. ,
She smiled ;
A nd nexi
I satb her husband , wild.
Annexed,
She smiled; ■
I bowed.
It will be seen that,. as the rules for the
Reversolet had not been fully given, a poet’s
licence has been granted to many of the re-
versolets printed, including one of the
winners. Reversolets quoted on this page
will be paid .for at space rates, which will
average out at three shillings per reversolet.
Those who are interested in myths will
find a great variety of these curious animals
in The Myths of Greece and Rome and Myths
of the Norsemen , both by H. A. Guerber
(Harrap, per Angus and Robertson, Sydney).
These volumes, 7s. 6 d. net in England, and
9s. net here, are illustrated profusely with
reproductions of ancient and modern concep-
tions of the mythologies of Europe. Here
the general reader can find all the details of
the quite scandalous doings of the ancient
gods. Their escapades are politely put, as
bluntness would be out of place in volumes
meant for the general public. Even thus
bowdlerised, the books are timely and service-
able, and are sure to have a great sale.
Ancient mythology is a complicated business;
but with the help of the letterpress and the
lavish illustrations (modern as well as
ancient) the reader can get an accurate, if
somewhat bald, account of the myth at work
and at play. As reference books they fill that
empty feeling in the mental stomach which
is known as a much-felt want.
The Reversolet.
All Australasia seems reversoletting, and
the new verse-form has come to stay. But,
despite the ease with which competitors have
turned out the gentle reversolet, the form
requires an ingenuity not often appreciated.
The reversolet is not a mere repetition of
identical lines. There are exceptional cases
where this form has a force of its own gained
solely by repetition ; but it hardly deserves
the name of a new verse-form. Some excel-
lent examples of mere reversal were sub-
mitted.

A COMPLETE CURE.
“In the background of my memory there is a
distinct recollection of many days and weeks of
physical adversity, such as I almost dread to re-
call,” said Mr. Frederick William Martin, of No.
51 litt-street, Waterloo, when requested to give
an outline of his infirmities, now happily over-
come, “But,” he went on, “since anything I
tell you may prove a source of comfort and en-
couragement to other poor mortals, I’ll gladly do as
you wish. Yes, I was ailing for a very long time.
A more bilious subject than I used to be you
would have to travel a long way to find, and then
I doubt if he could speak of as many disappoint-
ments connected with his illness as I can—how I
gave first one medicine and then another a trial,
meeting failure after failure, till one could scarcely
believe there was anything in an apothecary’s
shop that had not been resorted to, and all to no
purpose, when I would give all the drugs and pills
and things up in digust, only to start again later
on, through the demands of my sufferings, and go
through the same experience again. At last I
consulted a doctor, a vain hope it appeared to me
after what I had taken already, and so it proved
to be, for my health was no better than before.
To get up of a morning and feel that there is no-
thing pleasant to be done or thought of during the
day, may not seem in itself a very serious affair;
but it indicates that a person’s health is not what
it should be, and if allowed to go unchecked
through neglecting to take some good medicine,
the consequences may prove more serious than
you would imagine.”
“You believe, then, that if you had taken a
remedy when you found yourself suffering from
lassitude and inability to eat and sleep properly,
you would have avoided the sickness you en-
countered?” i v
“Most decidedly I do. I verily believe that if
I had taken a bottle or two of Clements Tonic at
the outset it would have saved me pounds and
pounds, besides the intense misery I endured.
This is what I always tell my friends, to attack
their ailments at once With Clements Tonic, not
to wait till they get a firmer hold of the system,
because the troubles then take longer to eradicate.
My appetite faded, till it had completely vanished,
and I simply forced myself to eat; my nights be*
came more restless, and I got up feeling that I
did not care whether I stood on my feet or sank
to the bed again. A dimness affected my eyesight,
a bitterness spread on my tongue, which was
always coated white, and from daylight till dark
I was never free from headaches. Small amounts
of food made my stomach most uncomfortable,
and between the shoulders it felt like a sharp-
pointed instrument tapping there every now and
then. And how fearfully dizzy I used to get be-
fore Clements Tonic got to work, besides which
my nerves were as shaky as could be. Anyhow,
I was not much good for work in those days, and
felt as wretched as though I were dead to the
world, which I practically was. Thanks to
Clements Tonic, though, I quickly had some life
and energy infused into me, and felt that I wanted
to live and enjoy the world’s blessings, like any
other person—the reverse of what I had been be-
fore using Clements Tonic, which braced my
nerves and invigorated the system throughout, in
a manner that astonished all who had observed
my frail condition a little while previously.”
“Have you had a return of any of your old
troubles, Mr. Martin?”
“I can safely say that since Clements Tonic
completed my cure at the time I speak of, no
body could wish for better health than I have en-
joyed, which shows that there was no patchwork
about that wonderful remedy’s way of doing
things. If I hear a person say a headache is at
work, I recommend Clements Tonic, because it
cured mine; should the complaint be about giddi-
ness, flatulence, kidney troubles or drowsiness, or
discomfort after eating, Ittell them to use Clements
Tonic, as it cured me of those ills, and the proof
of the pudding is in the eating thereof.”
“So we can publish what you say?”
“My permission is yours—in any way you like
to conceive.”

A Cold Bath on a Hot Day.
A cold bath on a hot day is refreshing
Every pore of your body is more open in
hot weather and requires more frequent
cleansing than in cold weather.. The pores
in hot weather absorb more freely than in
cold weather; it is therefore most unde-
sirable, after taking a morning bath, to
cover the body with underclothing that
has been washed with adulterated common
soap. For comfort, cleanliness and free-
dom from skin disease the clothing worn
next the skin should be washed with a
pure and well-made soap. If Sunlight

absorb purity.

Ebb and Flow.
O, I recall a seascape wide
Broad-fronting a cosy bay,
And a coming tide and a going tide,
And a twilight dim and grey.
The soft enchantment of the hour
Had made us mute and still,
And we were one with tree and flower
And sea and sky and hill.
We saw the sea-mists rise and float,
The break of waves we heard,
And, in the hills above our boat,
A single singing bird.
The far-off breakers, white of crest,
That murmured low and long,
To me they sang a song of rest,
To him a roving-song.
Through all there moved mysteriously
A wonder-working hand ;
He turned his eyes upon the sea,
And I upon the land.
A star of evening lit the dome,
The twilight bird sang on ;
To me it said, “ Come Home, Come Home ! ”
To him, “ Begone, Begone !”
And thus we read, as on a scroll,
Age-old and lettered dim—
The land was fashioned for my soul,
The sea was made for him.
O, some must bide at the red hearthside,
And some long leagues must roam,
And he went out with the ebbing tide,
And I with the flood came home.

Song of Dawn.
The young red dawn comes creeping
Above the distant ranges,
And, oh ! he is a blithe soul,
That young, red dawn of day.
While still the Bush is sleeping
The night sky gleams and changes,
Where he has waved a bright hand
And wiped the dark away.
The magpies, waking, sing him
A slender song of morning,
And the old world arises
With drowsy eyes and smiles.
The flowers their petals fling him,
His royal road adorning,
As slow he saunters onward
Over the golden miles.
And all the tall gums nodding
Their lovely heads to greet him,
Whisper of him together
And sigh as he goes on ;
Until the sun-god, plodding
His weary round, shall meet him,
And the white day stand revealed,
Radiant and alone.

ALICE GRANT ROSMAN.
The Earth.
I do not know what worlds they know
Who say that ours has little worth,
For though it has enough of woe
I never knew a greener earth ;
And I shall revel in its fun
Until I find a better one.
They reason from the things they want,
Not from the blessings they possess ;
And grumblers’ joys are ever scant;
I find earth full of happiness—
No better place occurs to me
Except what it, perchance, might be.
In each new bud does laughter lie ;
And if amongst its fruitful bowers
A host of buds unfruitful die,
The earth is very full of flowers ;
In harvests lost I do not root,
I am content with ripened fruit.
Sorrow’s a weed that ever grows
In gardens watered well with tears—
Small wonder earth is full of woes ;
And yet such gladness still appears
That, though some would to Heaven fly,
Here will I live—until I die.

They talked about the weather; then
Of things of more concern to men—
Of kindred souls and tastes, and he
Admired her sweet sincerity.
Upon the sands acquaintance grew,
And side by side they praised the view.
His empty heart, all far and wide,
Had sought affinities, he sighed.
Till now in vain her heart, said she,
Had hungered for sweet sympatfiie.
He said his life’s one stern duress
Had been the blight of loneliness.
She asked of Heaven but one dole,
The fondness of a faithful soul.
Their hands were clasped. Their pose the chan

Great Tory Editor: “Yes, Mr. Fisher, it has given me great pleasure to be able to support you as I have done. I supported Senator Glassey
towards the end of his career, and he’s politically dead. I got into the habit of speaking kindly of Senator Dawson, and he’s
politically dead. lam giving strong support now to Premier Kidston, of Queensland, and he’ll soon be politically dead. And now
I’m supporting you, Mr. Fisher, so I suppose you may be dead any day. It is very unfortunate, the way I lose my friends.”

How to A ddress Letters.
Correspondents to Tun Bulletin would oblige the paver
(and, to an extent, themselves) by taking some care as to
methods of address.
Business letters (with regard to subscriptions, advertise-
ments, etc.) should in no case be addressed to the Editor,
but to the Manager. To send them to the Editor is to
invite inattention.
It is not a good thing to address editorial letters to
anyone by name. “ The Editor, Bulletin,” is the proper
superscription for "copy.” Delay, and even loss, is
sometimes caused by addressing to persons instead of
officials. The person may not be there ; the otficial
always is.

THE SUDDEN AND REMARKABLE
DEVELOPMENTS OF THE FISHER
MINISTRY.
The ' Fisher Ministry—Australia’s new Labor
Ministry—put up a record in the very early days
of its existence. It backslid faster even than
Thomas Bent at his worst. Within a week or
ten days from the date when it met Parliament
with its statement of policy, it had earned the
cordial approval of the Tory press for its “ modera-
tion ” and “reasonableness,” and such-like quali-
ties. It didn’t bring about this result by com-
pelling the Tory press to admit the justice and
wisdom of its ‘ views, for that result can’t be
arrived at in so short a time ; the Victorian Mini-
mum Wage Law, for instance, is to some extent
approved of now by the Tory press, but the
approval only came to pass when eight or ten
years of success had .made the old yarn about
inevitable failure ridiculous. The Fisher
Government, as regards the most urgent matter
of legislation which it had in hand, took a short
cut to the applause and back-slapping of
the Tory organs by doing what the Tory
organs told it to do, and along that line of
conduct it arrived promptly. Glassey, of
Queensland, struggled along for something
like a dozen years before he reached the disastrous
point at which the Brisbane Courier began to
speak kindly of him; and KIDSTON was about eight
years in politics before the Tory papers com-
menced to stroke him gently down the back, and
make friendly overtures, and say “pretty cocky.”
In the Federal capital matter, however, Fisher
and his colleagues got there with a rush. Already
it is difficult to see what point of principle pre-
vents a coalition between the Fisher party and
the Deakin following unless the Deakin following
would prefer not to be seen in such company;
and the gap between Fisher and Joseph Cook
has diminished appreciably.
* * * «
In the settlement of the Federal capital ques-
tion the new Government has made two notable
surrenders. It has given way to the advocates of
State domination over the Commonwealth, and.it ■
has thrown overboard the principle of the Referen-
dum. Also it has made at least a partial sacrifice of
the principle that the unearned increment created
by the expenditure of public money should belong
to the public. The method whereby the
Australian capital was shifted from Monaro to
Yassberra was a perfectly simple one. When the
Australian Parliament legally selected Dalgety
by a solid majority no notice was taken of its
decision. When it selected Yassberra, notice
was taken immediately. In other words, the
idea was that Parliament should continue to toss
up till the Tor} 7 party won, while any wins scored
by the other party were ignored. Also, when the
Tory party won, the tossing process was to stop,
lest it should lose again. The position would be
exactly the same if it were understood that when-
ever Hughes w r on the election at West Sydney
the vote should be treated as if it had never
happened, but that as soon as his opponent won
the election should be good and valid. It was
inevitable, under this policy, that the parochial
party must win some time. Dalgety had
only on its side the friends of Australia
—those who wanted to see the Australian
capital a great and noble city, with a
healthy climate, fine scenery, a supply of water
power which would lead to the establishment of
great factories in which the artisans would work
under the best conditions as prescribed by a demo-
cratic Federal Parliament; a city with a port of
its own and a territory large enough to enable
the public ownership of land to have a fair trial.
Dalgety had practically no other support, for the
local population is so small that its local influence
doesn’t count for much. It hadn’t any land-
jobbing interest behind it. for no one is cutting
up big estates for sale thereabouts. It wasn’t
in or near to a Labor electorate, and its
selection wasn’t calculated to please, in a
purely selfish sense, any Labor member’s con-
stituents and help his re-election. Dalgety lies
in a region where electorates are large, and
a place like that can only rely on the purely selfish
support of one member —its own. On the other
hand, where population is dense and electorates
are small it is possible for one site to be at the
back-doors of half-a-dozen members, and to com-
mand the purely mercenary applause of them all
—for which reason either Hell or Botany would
command more votes than the Garden of Eden
any day. Dalgety’s weak point was that it had
nothing to recommend it save its merits and the
public interest.
* ■* * *
On the other hand Yassberra had many side-
issues in its favor. It was supported by (1) the
people who want to make State influences
supreme as against Federal influences; (2) the
Sydney importing people; (3) those who want a
mean capital with no special advantages for the
establishment of manufactures under Federal in-
dustrial conditions, because they suspect that
such conditions would be too liberal ; (4)
those who want a small Federal territory
with no room for experiments in Federal
land-ownership (the fact that the N.S.W.
State Government has carried its point, and been
allowed, after four years’ conflict, to veto the site
selected by the Australian Parliament, strengthens
its position for further dictation as to the area of
the Federal territory); (5) those who object to the
idea of a Federal port which may help to make
the capital great (if,a port must be granted, these
people think it a good joke to give one which,
being inside the prohibited 100-miles radius of
Sydney, can only be held on a most insecure
tenure); (6) the Congested Population Party,
which holds that the new population which the
establishment of a capital will attract should be
planted as near as possible to where population is
already thickest; (7) the importing and Anti-Sosh
daily papers of Sydney, which want the Australian
capital where it will be within the immediate
range of their influence; (B)the Tired Crowd, which
finds it easier to give way to the two truculent
scolds who have successively run the State Legis-
lature at Sydney than to assert Australia’s consti-
tutional right of choice. Also, the sectarian in-
fluence was borrowed for the occasion, and a
prominent Yellow Pup person was obtained to
weep publicly to the effect that the selection of
Dalgety was a “Romish conspiracy,”or words to
that effect. The papers which argued the case in
the Congested Population interest made no secret
of their anti-Australian views. They said that
the Australian capital would never be more
than a country town, and they recommended
Yassberra as a place where their desire to dis-
grace Australia with a mere village capital Would
be fully gratified. But despite this cynical frank-
ness the influences at work were so numerous that
they were bound to snatch a vote at some time or
other (if the matter was left open indefinitely) for
the Congested Population site. If the matter
still remained open the Congested Population site
would go under again on its own demerits, but
the method adopted has been to ignore the de-
cision of Parliament for years and years, till the
Congested Population Party snatched a victory,
and then to rush a settlement inside two months,
and nail the matter down hard.
* * * *
The Labor party has played the game of the
Tories, the importers, and the rest of the meaner
elements of the community for all it was worth.
When Parliament decided in favor of Dalgety—
the place which had only its merits to recommend
it—the caucus apparently did not regard the
decision as binding, and so it did not rally up the
party to give aunanimous vote. Instead, the matter
was left an open question, and the remarkable Wat-
son and the time-serving and shuffling Hughes
and others were allowed to denounce the Parlia-
ment’s selection as freely as they pleased. One
explanation is that the Sydney Tory press had
created an impression that Sydney was clamoring
for a capital as near as possible to its door, and
therefore the Labor members who represented
Sydney and adjacent constituencies were allowed
to clamor for a capital in the Congested Popu-
lation district in order to please their constituents,
and in order to buy votes for the party even at
the sacrifice of Australia’s interests. There were
no Federal Labor constituencies in the neighbor-
hood of Dalgety, so again that place had to travel
on its merits. But when the utterly unsuitable
site which was advocated by the Tory press, and
which was also as adjacent as possible to the
Labor electorates of Watson, Hughes and Hall,
snatched a majority, it was apparently discovered,
for the first time, that to oppose the choice of
Parliament was a Wrong Thing, and the party
was whipped up to vote solidly for Yassberra.
When, after Parliament had made its first selec-
tion, the Labor party still left the matter an open
question, this paper had an idea that it did so on
a point of honor, which mistake it now deeply
regrets. The party’s amazing change of
front suggests that it hasn’t anything like
so much honor as was commonly supposed.
The kind of political conscience which could
see its obligations so clearly at one time and
couldn’t see the same obligation worth a cent at
another time is a very handy conscience to have
about the premises. This handy conscience had
its reward in the cordial approval of the Anti-
Sosh papers., Also . it possibly helped to
strengthen the position of Watson (or his succes-
sor) at South Sydney, and Hughes at West
Sydney, and Hall at Werriwa, who all appeal,to
the Congested Population Party for support—at
least it will probably strengthen Hughes’ posi-
tion till his water-side workers realise that their
eloquent and shifty representative has actually,
in his hurry and his blindness, been voting for
the establishment of a new rival port only 87
miles from Sydney, to steal away Sydney’s trade
and the Sydney water-side workers’ jobs. Then
it may be that his constituents will throw clods at
the brilliant but shifty Hughes.
* * * *
Something was said in a tentative sort of way
about a referendum, but the proposition was
squashed in haste by the Labor Government' and
its supporters. Yet it is difficult to imagine any
subject on which a reference to the people is
more called for. The Yassberra-Jervis Bay pro-
posal was first heard of two months ago, and
already it has been rushed into law. There has
been no referendum, no general election, not even
a by-election, to give’ the community a chance of
expressing its views. The right of the people to
be consulted on a matter of the greatest
possible importance vanished from the Fisher
Government’s horizon on this occasion. A
demand for red-hot haste—such haste as would
make any serious consideration by the community
at large a wholly impossible thing—seemed to
possess everybody. Possibly the haste was based
on a fear lest an appeal to the people might upset
the Yassberra cart; possibly it wasn’t. Anyhow,
the Fisher Government apparently whipped up
its supporters to the best of its ability, and it
sprinted the matter through amid the applause of
the Tory element generally—the same crowd
which says that Fisher has designs on the
marriage tie and wants to wreck the home.
It took the easy line of least resistance, and it
got there—for the time, at least. Its attitude, said
that bitter enemy of progress, the S. M.
Herald, “deserves hearty endorsement by the
people of the Commonwealth.” As already men-
tioned, it took Glassey and Kidston a long
while to get the hearty endorsement of papers
like the S. M. Herald.
* * * *
It now remains to be seen what chance there is
of this very obliging Labor Government making a
serious stand for the 900 square miles that have
been demanded. The area is very small. Even if it
were a complete square it would only represent
30 miles by 30 miles, but owing to questions of
water supply, access to the sea, etc., it is more
likely to resemble a snake than a rectangle. There-
fore a whole lot of the land values created by
the expenditure of Australia’s public money are
certain to slop over the border to enrich the
private landlord on the other side, to the great
advantage of the private landlord and the great
damage of the Labor party’s doctrines re the un-
earned increment. But the N.S. W. State Ministry
doesn’t propose to grant even half the area de-
manded, and as the Fisher Government has
already established a precedent of yielding to
State Frights clamor it will probably yield again.
The Cook party will most likely begin to talk
compromise. The Fisher Government will find
that it must either cave in or lose its sudden popu-
larity with the Tory dailies. All the influences
already enumerated which brought about the
original Yassberra selection will rise up and call
on Fisher not to spoil the beautiful job already
effected by obstinacy about a small difference of
(say) 500 square miles. If the selection of Yass-
berra and the surrender thus made to the Congested
Population Party had a valuable tendency to
make more secure the seats of Hughes,
Watson and Hall, another surrender of the
interests of Australia, by cutting down the
Federal territory from 900 square miles to (say)
400, in order to prevent the newly-arrived capital
going away again, will also tend to secure the
seats of Hughes and Watson and Hall. So
when the next Amending Bill comes along it is
quite possible that the maintenance of thp 900
square miles of Federal territory will be left an
open question, and that more things will happen.
It can only be hoped that this complaisant party
won’t carry its complaisance so far as to one day
make White Australia an open question. It has
already refused to definitely state whether it is
going to be a Protectionist party working in the
interests of the Australian people, or a Foreign-
trade party doing odd jobs for the antbAustralian
importer—at least its leader has said that its tariff
attitude will be revealed in due time, or words to
that effect. Possibly this is still another matter
on which it will yet earn the applause'of the Tory
press. It has so far had quite remarkable luck in
that direction.
THE POLITICAL CLOWN OF VICTORIA.
Bent was defeated the other day in the Victorian
Assembly—defeated by 12 votes in a House
wherein he had a huge majority when it first met
after the general election only 17 short months
ago. He was defeated because almost every
decent politician of his own party left him in
disgust, and he had very little save the fools and
scrag-ends left. The attack was led by John
Murbat, who was once Bent’s Minister for
Lands —the same Murray who virtually threw
his portfolio in his leader’s face in the Assembly
when some more than usually outrageous example
of Bent’s folly and cowardice had tried him past
endurance. His charge against Bent was simply
that Thomas is the last possibility in the way of
folly, incompetence, lack of political principle,
and lack of political decency; that he is
a clown by nature, and a bear by be-
havior ; that his very existence, let alone his
Premiership, makes Victoria a laughing-stock
among white communities ; that he has thrown
overboard every item of his alleged programme in
order to hang on to office ; that he does nothing
nowadays save perform weird antics that wouldn’t
be tolerated at Rickards’ show, and tell incredible
stories about the things he used to do in his youth
(the tons of potatoes he carried on his back, and so
forth), and sing alleged comic songs (being one of
those persons who can’t sing, but do), and
skedaddle ridiculously about the country in a
motor car, promising everything to everybody.
Murray’s task was easy; in fact, when he had said
one-tenth of what he might have said, he left off
through physical exhaustion, and then the House
voted Bent right out. But Bent didn’t go out;
instead, he fled to the new, fresh Governor,
and asked for a dissolution, and amazing
to relate he got it. One might rather
have expected the Governor to fall down dead
with surprise at Bent’s temerity in making the.
request. In a little over two years Thomas had
dissipated a huge majority and driven it to revolt
against him. He had had thrown at his discredited
head the resignation of every colleague of any
weight in Victorian politics: Murray, Peacock,
Swinburne, Mackinnon, Boyd, Gillott— they
might be a, fairly poor lpt, but they were at least
above the utter ruck in capacity, and they fled
from Bent’s Cabinet in these latter days as if it
were infected. Such an unprecedented flight
might have suggested to even the.dullest Governor
that there was something so far wrong with
Bent that someone else—either Prendergast or
Murray, or a Prendergast-Murray combination
—should get a chance to run the State. But
T. Gibson-Carmichael didn’t see the point, and
Bent got his dissolution.
* * * *
The only thing that can be seriously alleged
against Bent as a politician is that he hasn’t a re-
deeming feature in his character. (Thatis saying
nothing of his private character, though on that
subject whole volumes have been said.) Apart
from his complete lack of a redeeming feature,
there is nothing about him, politically, that any-
one can reasonably object to. For a while after
he climbed to the roof of affairs he was the anti-
borrowing Premier, the advocate of financial
honesty and solvency, the man who toiled hard to
pay off the floating debt and put the State’s
finances straight. It was probably only a pose,
for no one seriously suspects Bent of having any
political principle save the principle of keeping
Bent in office ; but anti-borrowing Premiers are
so rare in Australia that even if a man takes up
that attitude from the worst motives he deserves
support. But Thomas Bent has wearied of that
attitude. He has become once more the borrower
and boomer that he was of old, like the dog men-
tioned in the last verse of the second chapter of
11. Peter. And after that change in his attitude
there seems to be no single reason why any
respectable human being should support Bent
any longer.
* * * *
The present Premier represents the tail-end of
the Old Brigade which has done such unspeakable
damage to Victoria. Thanks to it Victoria is
practically a dying State. The one streak of luck
that has come its way in the last 40 years has been
Protection. That at least kept Melbourne alive
and growing, while Toryism and the Big Land-
lords were ruining the best of the country dis-
tricts ; and the fact that Melbourne remained
alive prevented the State becoming utterly dead.
But the condition of the country districts was and
still is lamentable. Victoria is divided into 37
counties, and of these, eight, all in the most
fertile districts, showed a smaller population
in 1901 than in 1891, while about 1C others
showed such a small increase that they
might be described as practically stationary.
Six counties, all in the fertile and well-watered
region, showed a smaller population in 1901 than
in 1881—they had been decaying for 20 years—
while nine had been practically stationary during
the two decades. Furthermore, five counties
showed a smaller population in 1901 than in 1871
• —they had been decaying for 30 years. In one
case population had fallen from 84,000 to 57,000 ;
in another, from 60,000 to 48,000. Also in seven
counties the increase in 30 years was just a shade
better than nothing. In addition to this there
were two counties, both located in the most
fertile part of Victoria, which showed a smaller
population in 1901 than in 1861—they had been
decaying under the curse of big-landlordism for
40 years. Hardly anything grows in Victoria
save Melbourne, and but for the blessing of Pro-
tection it wouldn’t grow either.
• • * •
Victoria is being killed in order that Bent and
suchlike political trash may not be deprived of
their jobs. To save it, they would have to do
battle with the House of Rich Landowners,
and they might lose their billets in the scuffle.
The State has already lost one member in the
House of Representatives through its decreasing
importance, and at next adjustment it is due to
lose another. It has been exporting agricultural
population on a huge scale for about 18 years, and
it has done this solely through the fact that, even
in its great empty areas —the areas of decreasing
population—its young men can’t get land on
which to settle. It is becoming a State of old
men, old women and children, because the
strong, young people go away to look for land.
The Federal Statist estimates that there are in
Victoria 66,000 aged dodderers of 65 years or
more, while N.S.W., with a much larger popula-
tion, has less than 47,000, and S.A., with one-
third of Victoria’s population, has not more than
one-fifth its number of venerables. The con-
dition hasbecomeso lamentable through the whole-
sale departure of the young men and womeiii
from the decaying country districts of Victoria to'
look for a bit of soil where the landlord doesn’t,
demand the whole produce as rent, that in Beni’s;
State 50 out of every 1000 persons are qualified by
their years for the old age pension, while in the
rest of the Commonwealth the proportion is only
28 per 1000. Victoria is the only State of the
Commonwealth in which the number of women
exceeds that of men —a result that is wholly
attributable to the compulsory exodus of the
young male agricultural population. It is a
land where wealth and spinsters and old human
wrecks accumulate while real men decay. Its
birth-rate (2532 per 100,000 people in 1907, as
compared with the Commonwealth’s general aver-
age of 2655) is far below the ordinary Australian
figure. Its marriage rate (773 per 100,000 in-
habitants, compared with the Commonwealth’s
781) is below the average. Its death rate
(1174 per 100,000 people, as compared with the
Commonwealth’s record of 1090) is above the
average, and is far the worst record in Australasia.
In three out of the last six years dealt with in
Knibbs’s valuable Official Year Book, it is
set forth that the male population of Victoria
decreased , though females multiplied steadily.
And when one considers that 13 out of the 37
counties (Grant, Anglesey, Talbot, Grenville,
Ripon, Follett, Lowan, Kara Kara, Millewa,,
Gladstone, Gunbower, Rodney, and Wonnan-
gatta), at last census, showed a smaller population
than they had had at some previous period of their
history, this is not surprising. The Big Landlord
is extirpating population fast in the best of the
Victorian country districts.
* ■* ♦ *
And what is Bent’s remedy for this awful decay
of what was once the most virile community in
Australia? He promised to find one or two or
three million acres of State land for settlement,
and found none. The State lands that are still
available are mostly leased at nominal rents
to Bent’s friends, the adjoining Big Landlords,
whom Bent wouldn’t offend at any price. He
promised to repurchase estates for Closer Settle-
ment, but as he refused to attempt any system of
compulsory purchase the State simply became an
extra buyer in a community where, by reason of
the Big Landlords’ earth hunger, there were
already 10 buyers to one seller, so Bent got very
little land, and only got that at such absurd prices
that his prospective closer settlers can’t settle—
they would be ruined if they made the attempt.
Next Bent promised, and abandoned, and pro-
mised again and abandoned some more,
a Land Valuation Bill, which would have
done little good in any case. Now the
disorderly and useless old man proposes, as the
great idea on which he appeals to the community,
to enact that no country landowner shall hold
more than £50,000 worth of land, and to give the
Big Landlord of to-day 20 years in which to get
down to that level. That would mean, roughly
speaking, that after 20 years waiting the whole of
the country lands of Victoria might be divided
among about 2000 owners, which doesn’t seem a-
reform worth waiting for through all these years,.


That, and some huge loans, and a lot of railways,
and a promise that selectors shall have many years
extra time in which to pay instalments on
the land they can’t get, constitute Bent’s
election programme. The Big Landlords are
to be quite undisturbed for years, and then
they are only to be nominally disturbed.
The new railways will increase the already
enormously inflated prices which they demand for
their land. The Land Valuation Bill having been
thrown overboard, the country earth-shark will
still value £lO worth of land at 505., and his
alleged Is. rate will be really 3d., and his roads
will still be paid for mostly by the subsidies which
this rich and shameless cadger drags from the
Treasury. And these subsidies are largely made
up by wicked exactions from the heavily-burdened
city toiler, for even the poorest little girl worker
in Melbourne has to give her copper in compul-
sory charity to further bloat the big squatter and
the man whose innumerable Cow blots out the
view of the horizon. For the dry rot which has
come upon Victoria, and which threatens to make
it another Ireland, the unspeakable Bent has
really no remedy save his incoherent roar, and a
wild statement that he used to be an actor, and
an improbable allegation that the dead weight of
potatoes which he frequently carried on his back
along Brighton beach in the days of his youth was
something tremendous.
♦ * * *
Victoria has to choose between Bent and ruin.
means ruin ; he also means disgrace. It is
a question if there is in all the white man’s world
another ruler whose bearish antics fill the foreign
visitor with such wonderment and mockery as do
those of Thomas of Brighton. And, in addition,
Bent has been charged with about as many dis-
graceful doings—quite apart from his utter in-
capacity and his public antics —as any twenty
ordinary politicians. It is questionable if he has
a real political friend in all Victoria, and it would
be a disgrace if he had. But he lives by saving
the Big Landlord from taxation ; by persuading
the deluded and ignorant little farmer that the
graduated land-tax is intended to despoil him,
instead of being, as it really is, a device to set him
on his feet; by bribing the constituencies with
innumerable grants for all manner of purposes;
by gigantic promises—he must have now about
£20,000,000 of promises floating around hopelessly
dishonored ; by assurances of new loans and booms
and public drunks; by pandering to sectarian
bigots and rich monopolists and shabby pony-race
sharks ; and by being “Tommy”—big, bluff, roar-
ing, bulldog Tommy—to all manner of people of the
pothouse order of intelligence. And even with
all these qualifications the end of Bent and of
BENT-ism is in sight.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Wade Hints that the Australian Parliament
Must Climb Down a Bit Further.
To secure finality, concessions may be necessary. This
State is not likely to insist upon a ricfici interpretation, of
the text of the Constitution Act, and I f.eel sure that the
Parliament of the Commonwealth will reciprocate the
generous spirit in which we are prepared to deal with
this subject.— Extract from letter re the Federal Capital
Written by N.S:W< State Premier Wade to Prime
Minister Fisher.
When the Seat of Government Bill was before
the Senate the other day, Mr. Givens, of Queens-
land, suggested—re the promised port at Jervis
Bay—that the Bill should embody a request for
five square miles adjoining that harbor. That
meant a bit of land 2£ miles by 2J miles—not the
whole bay, but about one-fortieth part of it.
Thereupon Millen, Foreign-trader and paro-
chialist, who is supposed to be in the confidence of
Wade and bis anti-Australian following, declared
that Givens’ only object could be “to kill the Bill.”
Apparently, in the eyes of the party which wants
a mean and wretched capital, the idea that the
promised Federal port should embody even the
petty area of five square miles is so outrageous
that it couldn’t be considered seriously ; probably
a quarter-acre allotment on the sea-coast, with
room for a single line of rails to connect it with
the capital, is that crowd’s idea of liberality.
State Premier Wade’s idea is further expounded
above. The capital has already been shifted by a
spineless Federal majority to the place which
Wade dictated. The originally mooted 5000
square miles has been cut down to a demand for
900 miles only. Any demand for a Federally-
owned water supply has been dropped. And,
after all this crawling down, Wade briefly replies
that further “concessions may be necessary.”
Furthermore, Wade revives the old lie-by-
implication that the “text of the Consti-
tution ” fixes 100 square miles as the area
of the Federal territory—which it doesn’t; it
fixes the area of the Federal territory at anything
from 100 to about 200,000 square miles. In fact, so
long as the Federal territory doesn’t come within
100 miles of Sydney there is no limit fixed. And
because Wade is prepared to grant a little more
than the irreducible minimum—perhaps 200
square miles—he has the unspeakable effrontery
to demand admiration for hjg “generous spirit.”
The amazing thing is that, even among the weak,
easy-going individuals who have been allowed to
control the destinies of the Commonwealth, there
hasn’t been one who has had the courage to put this
outrageous bluffer’s pretensions to a legal test.
Wade talks largely about where he and his gang
will permit the Federal capital to be, and where
they won’t permit it to be ; vet it is 100 chances
to one that if the matter were carried to the
High Court it would prove that the right to
locate the capital site rests wholly with the Aus-
tralian Parliament, and that neither Wade
nor any other State Premier has any more voice
in the matter than King Bii.lt of nowhere in
particular. Wade also speaks in an extensive
style about the area that he and his crowd will
give for a Federal territory and the area that they
won’t give ; yet it is 1000 to one that an appeal to
the High Court would bring the emphatic de-
cision that the Constitution gives the Australian
Parliament the sole and undivided right to decide
on the Federal area, and that it can take what
area it pleases. The statement that Wade and
his State Legislature have the right to veto the
site selected by the Australian Parliament, and to
dictate the area of the Federal territory, rests on
Wade’s own statement that Wade’s interpreta-
tion of the law is sound. Yet Wade’s law has
been before the High Court pretty frequently
of late, and almost every time his case has
been biffed out as utterly unsound. Why then
should the accuracy of Wade’s law be taken for
granted on Wade’s mere say-so? Apparently
this has bepn done because Federal politicians are
terrified lest Wade should be angry if his law.
were put to the test like that of any common
mortal. After all the climbing down that has
been done, the Australian Parliament has at last
demanded, with some slight show of firmness, a
poor little 900 square miles of country. Where-
upon Wade writes to Fisher and tells him in a
big, important manner (1) that he probably won t
get it; (2)—this is by implication, butthennplica-
tion is clear enough—that Wade, as self-appointed
interpreter of the Constitution, declares the mini-
mum of 100 square miles mentioned in the Con-
stitution to be the maximum, and anything given
over and above 100 square miles is a mere act of
grace on the part of the almighty Wade ;
and (3) that whatever it gets, the Australian
Parliament ought to be mighty thankful to Wade
and his gang, and admire their “ generous spirit.”
And what was the reply of Fisher —who was
supposed, till about a month ago, to be a strong
man ? If Fisher wrote back to say that he was
tired of being kicked from post to pillar by
Wade, of being told what Wade wouldn’t allow
and what Wade might allow if the Australian
Parliament properly appreciated his generosity ;
and that, in the matter of the Federal area at all
events, lie would find out in the High Court
whether Australia has any rights at all, or whether
it is merely Wade’s football —well, if Fisher
wrote to that effect, or to any effect even mod erately
adjacent to it, there is no public record of the
letter. Apparently he took Wade’s insolence
lying down. Quite humble people —mere ancient
civil service pensioners and the like —have
dragged Wade to the High Court and knocked
his law into a cocked hat, but the Australian
Governmeht accepts his decisions as to liis own
authority in a humble spirit. If it is necessary to
do this in order to retain the job of Prime Mini-
ster, the said job seems scarcely worth keeping at
the price.
T. Bent’s Wonderful Land Reform Dodge.
Thebe are quite a number of interesting features
about the scheme of alleged land reform with
which T. Bent is trying to beguile the electors of
Victoria into giving his discredited and disrepu-
table Government another lease of life. He.pro-
poses, in the first place, that a law shall be passed
limiting each country landholder to £50,006 worth
of the earth’s crust (unimproved value). Any
surplus he must get rid of by four instalments —in
5, 10, 15 and 20 years. This, to begin with, pro-
bably means that the country landholder shall be
limited to £IOO,OOO or £150,000 worth of land, for
Bent’s isn’t the sort of Government that is likely
to put its foot down firmly—large as its feet may
be— o n the great land valuation swindle. And
how great that swindle is few people know.
For instance, the existing Victorian Land
Tax Act specifies that no land shall be
valued for taxation purposes at more than £4
an acre, while it may be valued as low as £1 an
acre. The result is that the nominal exemption
of £2500 worth of land often means a real exemp-
tion of £25,0(10 worth or more. Everything goes
by an artificial scale of alleged sheep-carrying
capacity, and- if a man owned 640 acres in the
heart of Melbourne he would be wholly exempt
from the land-tax, his estate being considered,
because of the poor grazing in Bourke-street, as
‘ ortly worth'£64o or less. For local taxation pur-
poses the valuations are not quite so awful, yet
even they often set down the value of land at one-
fourth its market price. With such methods as
these in use the land valuation fake will be the
first thing that will prevent Thomas’s pro-
posed bogus law breaking up any big
estates worth mentioning. Then it doesn’t
even profess to begin to break up any-
thing, or to make a single acre available, until
after five years, and that, after allowing for the
time required to pass the measure, will mean at
least six years. If the measure ever becomes law,
and if it threatens to break up anybody’s estate,
there will thus be a tine large interval in which to
work for its repeal. A further trouble is that the
darned scheme is no good in any case. The
private lands of Victoria were recently valued by
COGHLAN at £126,000,000 (improvements not in-
cluded). When an allowance is made for city and
town lands, Bent’s scheme simply means that it
is to be legal for 2000 people to own all the pastoral
and agricultural soil of the State that is now in
private hands. That is practically leaving things
as they are ; in fact, when the valuations have
been judiciously faked, and, where necessary, a
judicious nominal division of the property has been
made among the present owner and his wife and
children (the old man taking a mortgage, or any
other security which seems advisable, over the
transferred portions), there seems to be no reason
why Bent’s proposed measure should make a
single landlord turn a hair, or really part with an
acre. And, in addition to all this, there are two
other drawbacks. First, Bent won’t make any
serious attempt to pass the Bill—probably won't
make any attempt at all. Bent’s brutal cynicism
is so marvellous that he throws over the small and
large items of his programme indiscriminately;
in fact, last session he abandoned his whole pro-
gramme in a heap. Secondly, if he does pass the
measure through the Assembly the House of Rich
Landlords will throw it out, and Bent won’t
kick or pretend to kick—in fact, he will probably
not so much as pretend to disguise his satisfaction.
He may even burst into song. The graduated
land-tax proposed by Bent’s opponents hasn’t
much chance of passing—almost the only hope of
a Victorian graduated land-tax lies in Federal
legislation—but it is advocated by men who have
some kind of reputation for sincerity, which is
something; and it is the sort of measure that is
worth passing, which is also something.

The Baby Pays.
,On a question whether two commas more or less
should be used in a Licensing Bill tbe S. Aus-
tralia Assembly is capable any day of talking for
-11 hours; but the other afternoon, having a
minute or so to spare, it considered the expedi-
ency of bringing in a Loan Bill for £2,563,000.
The House yawned and said “Aw’right! ” and
the Bill waS brought in. Thereupon Opposition-
leader Butler proposed to strike out some special
tuppence or so, but apologised for intruding when
,it was pointed out that the tuppence was badly
wanted. Also he added that the position of
S. Australia was simply magnificent. Why,
he knew of a case in his district in
which a man had bought a farm at
what seemed a fabulous price, yet times
had been so good that the man had got enough in
four years to pay for the property. Having thus
instanced the great prosperity of the State, the
Opposition leader cordially approved of the State
going to the pawnshop with renewed energy.
Having demonstrated how easy it should be for
this generation to pay its way in consequence of
the extra good times, he applauded the Govern-
ment for proposing not to pay its way, but to live
largely on I O U’s, payable by a generation that
probably won’t know what extra good times even
taste like. So, as the Government proposed the
easy, mean, selfish policy of leaning up against the
pawnshop, and as the Opposition leader hoorayed
the Government for its meanness and selfishness,
nobody thought it worth while to say anything.
Nobody thought it of any importance to point out
that S. Australia already owns, in proportion to
population, the biggest debt on earth, having a
couple of years ago beaten Queensland, the former
record-holder. And nobody mentioned that this
proposed new debt of £2,563,000 means no less
than about £27 for every household in S. Australia
—£27 of new debt to shoulder, and to guarantee
the interest upon. And nobody asked the House
what the country with the greatest debt on earth,
and which proposes cheerfully to add so enor-
mously to that debt, intends to do supposing
trouble comes and it simply must borrow or burst
—when, for instance, an enemy comes hammering
at its door. Nobody said anything of any conse-
quence. Nobody asked anything. In a few odd
minutes the resolution was passed, the Loan Bill
was carried through, “and the Loan Estimates
for the current year and the excesses for the pre-
vious year were agreed to without debate.” What
did they have to trouble about! Wasn’t the bill
to be passed on to the baby !

N.S.W.’s Fading Land Asset.
It is interesting to note the steady fading away of
N.S.W.’s great land asset. There is very little
excitement to be got by studying the same ques-
tion in Victoria or Tasmania, for in this respect
they are practically used up and dead. On the
other hand, Queensland and Westralia have
hardly got to the fading stage—they are compara-
tively young, and have a fairly big fortune to
spend yet. But N.S.W. is the medium-sized
gt a te —neither a giant like Westralia nor a dwarf
like Tasmania. And it started earlier than some
of the other States, so its land sale revenue is now
scuffling down a steep place into the sea in a
rather conspicuous fashion. There is still land for
sale under the conditional purchase method,
whereby the soil is disposed of on long terms, and
the earth that remains is being steadily disposed
of on these lines. But nowadays, for every four
or five new purchasers who come into the business
six or seven old purchasers finish paying off
their instalments and cease to be Treasury
assets; so while the area of land sold steadily
increases, and the total amount of land sale
money that has been received and spent with no
revenue-producing works to show for it steadily
increases, the amount of money due to the State
by conditional purchasers grows beautifully and
wonderfully less. Some recent figures are worth
consideration: —

There are two unaccountable breaks in this series
of official figures. One happened in 1900, when
the increase in the total amount of l&nd sale
revenue received up to date was set' down as
less that £69,000. Apparently there was ail
auditing of accounts that year and a re-
adjustment of the figures, or a correction
of ancient errors, or some such old thing
happened, for the amount shown is quite
unaccountable. And the apparent absence of any
published figures for 1904 —at least this paper is
unable to find any —is also unaccountable, and
regrettable. But the main facts are obvious
enough. They are these : (1) Within the last 50
years N.S.W. has sold land to the value of nearly
£31,000,000 on the conditional purchase system
(this is irrespective of about £14,000,000 raised
through sales of land by auction and of sums
received through trading off the public estate in
other ways), and all this money has been spent as if
it were ordinary revenue, and there are practically
no revenue-prod ucingassets to show for it. (2) In 14
years the amount owing by selectors has dimin-
ished from £14,609,500 to £7,905,411, and if the
decrease goes on at the same rate another 14 years
will see this resource about ended. (3) When it is
ended, nearly £1,000,000 a year of income will stop
with a crash. ThenN.S.Wi will realise that it has
had a devil of a time, and has drunk up £50,000,000
or £60,000,000 worth of its original fortune, with
nothing in the way of reproductive property
to set against this great vanishment. And that is
an interesting discovery for any State to make.
Apparently, too, the stoppage will be fairly sud-
den when it comes; at least the accounts so far
show .that the amount annually collected from
land buyers remains very much the same year by
year, though the amount to be collected shrinks
rapidly. If this phenomenon continues it seems
that there may come a year when N.S.W. will
collect about the usual million from this source,
and the year after that it will get hardly a copper.
Then it will certainly be an astonished establish-
ment.

The Fluff-Merchant’s Wage-List.
The big, wholesale rag-importers are such all-
round and thorough-going enemies of the indus-
trial progress of the country that it seems only
fitting, and quite in keeping with things generally,
to find them charged with sweating their em-
ployees. There is in Melbourne an anti-sweating
league, of which Sam, M auger is the hustling
■secretary. Sam’s league lately made some rather
horrifying discoveries concerning the wages paid
in the fluff-merchants’ warehouses, and one
“ house ” in particular, of which details were
obtained, was singled out for investigation.
Straightway the league found itself butting its
head against a stone wall. It asked the firm to
nominate two commercial men, who would act
with two nominated by the league, the four to
report on the matter. And, in the thorough
Calico-Jimmy manner, the firm replied :
For were we to admit you and your nominees’ right to
dissect certain portions of our business, we would in all
fairness have to grant a similar concession to any other
league.
Then, to show how needless the efforts of the
anti-sweating league were, the firm added :
In 1906 the employees of the wholesale softgoods ware-
houses, feeling satisfied that the conditions under which
they were employed were fair and equitable to both
employer and employee, passed a resolution “viewing
with alarm the proposition of the Government to disturb
the existing conditions by bringing us under the Fac-
tories Act.”
It is a pathetic picture, this bogus and compulsory
alarm of the unfortunate warehouse employees at
the chance of their hours being shortened and
their wages raised. But after writing it the Fluff
purveyor felt so good that he finished up his
letter by carrying the war into the enemy’s camp
in the following quaint fashion :
Notwithstanding our decision as a firm, the writer is
still quite willing to discuss and publicly publish a com-
parison (upon sworn declaration) of the wages he pays to
the employees at his private house as compared with the
wages paid in the homes of each of the officers and council
of your league.
Apparently this refers to the cook and the little
girl who works in the pantry, also the man who
attends to the garden and milks the cow. But
what connection it has with the subject only a
calico magnate knows. There was, however, a
very obvious retort handy, to the effect that the
frill and flounce dealer was making such a huge
income by under-paying his warehousemen that
he had plenty of money to spend in getting him-
self and his family comfortably looked after. But
Mauger stuck to the old and simple question of
the wage of the warehouse employee, and coun-
tered thusly :
Statements have been made that reflect seriously on
youi firm as employers.... Unlike any; other leading
firms... you now definitely decline to discuss ;the
matter with the League.... The question that concerns
my council is : Are such wages being paid by your firm as
make it impossible for your employees to marry and keep
homes in decent comfort, or are they such as to drive
them to dishonesty and immorality?
To this question there came no reply. Probably
the Fluff Emperor believes, with Walpole, that
marriage is a luxury, reserved for Flinders-lane
magnates. But the Anti-Sweating League doesn’t
propose to be bluffed. The matter was handed
over for investigation to the vigilance .committee,
to report at next meeting. If the committee can get
the facts, the name of this particular rag importer
will then be published. It. is, incidentally, owing
to the cheap labor of the warehousemen that the
Australian manufacturer finds himself, in spite of
the tariff, often beaten in price by the imported
article. If the Calico Men can be made to pay
decent wages, it will be equivalent to several per
cent, more Protection. Anyway, it is an outrage
that, while the Australian manufacturer is under a
Wages Board, and has (and, of course, rightly) to
pay a decent wage, his principal competitors, the
importing brigands, have a free hand, and can pay
as little as they like. And that is darned little
indeed.
The story of Victorian Premier Bent’s land deal-
ings at St. Kilda (Melbourne) is a simple and
innocent tale. In the first place Bent acquired 25
acres of land on the shore. Later he proposed a
tramway. The tramway was to wander up New-
street, a highway of only moderate importance,
and avoid Bent’s land by the width of a full block.
Naturally a member (it was Toutcher, who re-
presents the country constituency of Stawell and
Ararat, but it might have been anybody) suggested
putting the tramline on the much ipore important
St. Kilda-street, and thus bringing it right along-
side Bent’s bit of land. Bent accepted the amend-
ment, and thus the House, which apparently didn’t
know that Bent had any land thereabouts, gave |
Bent a financial leg-up in a perfectly natural way.
According to law any public work of this kind,
which is estimated to cost £20,000 or more, must be
referred to the Railways Standing Committee, and
in the days when Irvine was "Premier and Bent
was only his henchman, the committee had
considered and rejected a proposal for a tram-line
in this same neighborhood. But when Bent
became Premier, and brought the proposition for-
ward again, the cost was put down at £19,500,
though it ultimately ran to a very gr.eat deal more;
so the Standing Committee didn’t get a second
chance to express its views on the subject. Som©
The Waster.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Waster leans, throughout the day,
Against a pub, “ darn Oarlton way,”
And, idly watching passing trams,
' Awaits the racin’ telegrams ;
While ever and anon will fly
This question to the passer-by—
His everlasting parrot cry,
“ Wot won the ’ Ur die 1 ”
He haunts his glorious racin’ clubs,
And frowsy private bars of pubs
Where wires are posted, from the course;
He argues endlessly of horse ;
The racing argot of the feouth
. Drops from his foolish'gaping mouth,
“Garni ! Positano —wot’s it done?—
Stiffened the moke before it run—
Backin’ the blank at ten to one—
Wot won the ’ Urdle 1 1 ”
The myriad hosts of Asian blood
Rise in a threatening yellow flood ;
The news comes of invading fleets ;
The papers issue scare-head sheets —
“ The Coming War !... The First Shot Fired !!”
The Waster scans them, bored and tired,
Sucking his everlasting fag :
“There ain’t no sportin’ in this rag,
Nothink but blanky scares an’ croaks !
Seepose them Japs is murderin’ folks,
Well, wot’s the ’urry ?... I say, blokes,
Wot won the ’ Urdle 1 ? ? ”
Swift outposts, from our tiny fleet,
Come in with news of dire defeat.
Reflecting on his latest bet
The Waster sucks his cigarette
And lounges through the clamoring throng
To ask the newsmen : “ ’Ere, wot’s wrong ?
Them last results ain’t come along !
Wot’s stopped the postin’ of ’em up?
Did Shyster get the Ascot Cup ?
Wot won the ’ Urdle 1 ? ? 1 ”
A trooper from our beaten host
Rides in -to gasp that all is lost:
“The army’s crushed, the Asian brown
Is marching upon Melbourne town !! ”
The Waster starts, and drops his butt:
“ Gorstrewth ! Seepose the pubs get shut!! ”
Then, lounging to the panting scout:
“ Say, mister, wot results is out ?
Darn’t want no guff abart the fray !
Lor’ blime, ain’t it Sattiday ?
I seen yer come darn Caulfield way,
Wot won the ’ Urdle ? ? ? 1 ? ”
The brown hordes reach at last their goal;
The Waster swells their human toll. '
His soul soars upward through the skies
Till Heaven’s walls before him rise.
All heedless of the ruling Fates
The Waster scans the Golden Gates,
Sucking a ghostly cigarette :
“ Them larst results ain’t posted yet! ”
And when the Angel of the Tomb
Draws near to seal the Waster’s doom,
He hears that lost soul’s accents strange,
As soon as he comes into range
Across the Universe : “ Say, Ange’,
Wot won the ’Urdle ?11 ?? 1 ”

Sir T. Bent, having persisted in imbibing
his political inspiration from the wrong bottle,
has quite naturally struck solid trouble. But the
forward policy of the Opposition, led by the
veteran Jack Murray, indicates the influence of
that Spirit of Wise Progress—D.C.L. Whisky.
There can be no doubt of the success, in capable
hands, of a progressive policy. It is as popular
with the electors as D.C.L. itself.*
estimates put the betterment of Bent’s land
through the tramway which accidentally came to
his door at as much as £13,000. Land is a
thing wHfh seems to have haunted Bent
all his life. He can’t keep away from it.
He used to dig land and grow vegetables
on it. He ran the Thomas Bent Land Co. and
other concerns. When he walked, his feet covered
more land, than the, average. When the boom
collapsed and left him broke he went on the land.
When he came back,to politics he undertook to
find great areas of State lands for settlement; he
started buying up private lands in a disastrous
way ; he acquired, land for State brick-works
which never eventuated ; he got stuck with land
acquired for workmen’s habitations ; and now his
land-dealing instincts threaten to be his political
ruin. Bent seems so utterly unable to get away
from land that it is 10 to one he will end by being
buried in it with a lot of it on top of him.
For Australia.
The Young Australia National Party has issued
its platform and manifesto. Put shortly, the aim
of the party is to rationalise the governmental
system of Australia. Australia badly needs a
movement of the sort. The trail of the “ cabbage-
treeite ” —of the person who is wont to describe
himself asa “colonial,’’and to regard this, hisnative
land, in thesame light as an Indian civil servantdoes
the land of Ram Chunder (namely, as a good place
for a civilised man to quit the moment his banking
account permits)—is over too much of the Com-
monwealth. Too many Australian laws are framed
and administered by frankly virulent anti-
Australians. This is an anomaly, not to say an
insanity, that the Young Australia Party has set
itself to correct. And so its main plank is Unifi-
cation—with the establishment of a multitude of
small States and an extensive Local Government
system to follow. Unification connotes the
abolition of the redundant State Parliaments,
which can be replaced by enlarged and glorified
municipal councils) The abolition of the State
Parliaments connotes the political extermination
of the Wade-Bent-Carruthers brand of human
tragedy. And their extermination connotes
honest finance, the possibility of a vigorous Defence
law and other measures of national urgency
being put on the C/ommonwealth Statute Book
without the registration of illegal protests (wire-
netting steals and the like) in the name of
State-Frightism ; a huge economy in the matter
of revenue, and a score of other benefits. The new
organisation stands for the abolition of the hope-
less party government system—the niodernTory’s
standby. The Tory’s traditional political attitude
is that of the small boy who, his heels fixed
doggedly in the dusj). endures the pain and indig-
nity of being shoved'on from behind by his more
powerful companion. Nothing gives the Tory a
stronger hold on the dust, so to speak, than the
out-of-date party system that this country
imported from Westminster when it was too
young to know any better. Elective Minis-
tries will be the bane of stagnation. They
will leave the reactionary politician no loophole
for acting as a brake on legislation the constitu-
encies have pronounced for. They are the corol-
lary of a genuinely democratic form of govern-
ment. The National Party goes uncompromis-
ingly for a compulsory Citizen Defence force, and
for an Australian navy built and manned by Aus-
tralians and under Australian control. It pro-
jects a Land Act that shall break up settlement-
hindering estates (if necessary, by progressive
taxation); re-afforestation on the Norwegian plan,
the provision of areas for settlement. As minor
planks it advocates the gradual repayment of all
existing loans, a Commonwealth Bank, a transcon-
tinental railway, and abolition of the futile Naval
subsidy arrangement. There are further ideals
that it puts before itself, but the above suffice to
show that the movement is worthy the support of
Australians who aspire to see their country ration-
ally and patriotically governed. The citizens of
this prosperous land can mostly find the money to
swell to bloated proportions the subscription-lists
that are gob up for popular cricketers, tramway
“loyalists,” or what not. The National Party is
taking in hand a work that is of more importance
than all the achievements of all the cricketers that
ever smote leather with wood, and of all the
“loyalists” that have scabbed since tramways
began. The Federal elections approach, and
money is needed if anything of value is to be done
in the near future. A list follows of the Organ-
ising Secretaries in the different States

road, Ascot Vale, Melbourne ; Queensland : H. Goodson,

street, Sydney, is President of the Committee.
The citizen who thinks it is worth while paying
out cash in his country’s cause, will get the best
of value for his money if he sends along whatever
he can afford to one of these centres.
N.S.W.’s Amazing Wade Finance.
N.S.W.’s astounding Wade-Waddell Govern-
ment continues to sprint financially down a steep
place along with the hogs of Gadara. Even the
admiring Tory morning papers were forced to
speak in faint condemnation when the November
returns came out. They said (1) that in the first
five months (July-November) of the financial year
revenue was £219,705 less than in the corres-
ponding period of last year ; (2) that ordinary ex-
penditure was £620,238 more than last year and
was the biggest expenditure ever heard of in
N.S.W. ; (3) that, consequently, the Treasury
was £839,943 worse off on the five months than on
the corresponding period of last year ; (4) that ex-
penditure is already £1,437,108 ahead of revenue ;
(5) that loan expenditure (£733,241) is £257,269
more than during the corresponding five
months of 1907 ; (6) that railway and
tramway expenditure is £329,582 more than
during the corresponding period of last year,
while railway and tramway revenue has only in-
creased by £83,954 ; and (7) that Wade’s Closer
Settlement Fund is becoming rather ridiculous,
when all the money that is spent on Closer Settle-
ment in five months is £9 —an amount which
would just about suffice to closely settle a beetle.
Apparently the present N.S. W. Government is so
busy attending to other people’s business in the
matter of the Federal capital that its own busi-
ness is left to run itself.
There are in this world some surprisingly
ignorant people, or else some surprising liars.
As a case in point, witness this hunk of misin-
formation from the Australian Review of
Reviews for December :
The Australians appear to have decided to throw away
with a light heart one of the distinctive privileges which
English-speaking communities have enjoyed all round the
world. Until now no one in an English-speaking State
was compelled to shoulder a rifle and learn the art of war.
The voluntary principle has hitherto been adequate to
secure soldiers for every time of need. But the Aus-
tralians, if they accept Mr. Ewing’s Defence Bill, will put
their necks under the j'oke and be the first English-
speaking community to introduce compulsory service.
This sort of slush is calculated to give any student
of history the tired feeling. At present, com-
pulsory military service is the law in the Channel
Islands (and it has been so for over 700 years), in
Cape Colony (the compulsory military service
law was passed 30 years ago, and every man
between 18 and 50 is liable not only for
local defence, but for war outside the
limits of the colony), in the Transvaal, in
Canada, in Egypt, and in a few minor dependen-
cies. British law provides for conscription. For
about 1000 years—from timeout of mind, longbefore
the days of Alfred the Great, till 1604, in the
days of James I.—universal and compulsory mili-
tary service was the policy of England. Then
came the period of the Trained Bands, service
being compulsory but not universal. After that
came the conscription period, which lasts to this
day, though a Bill is passed every year suspending
the law for another 12 months. According to
British law, the militia is a compulsory service force
recruited by ballot. In England the militia law was
enforced from 1808 to 1816 ; Scotland started con-
scription in 1797, and it was kept going for a good
many years; and in Ireland, from 1715 to 1809,
every Protestant between the ages of 16 and 60
was a compulsory soldier. There are quite a
number of delusions about “British freedom,”
and such-like, which look very well on the sur-
face, but crumble like Dead Sea fruit on inspection.
♦
This gentle and childlike item recently appeared
among the Maoriland news :
Wellington, Tuesday.—The Prime Minister states that
the financial stringency which has been experienced in
Maoriland has now eased considerably. The Advances to
Settlers Department is bringing money into the country
regularly at the rate of £lOO,OOO a month for lending
purposes. No money loaned by the Advances to Settlers
Department is being borrowed within the Dominion.
And so the stringency is passing away ! Ward’s
Loony Isles have now got into such a state of
financial drunk that they have to consume a
whole bottle before breakfast, otherwise their
trembling hands can’t empty the snakes out of their
boots. So unnatural have become the conditions
now, that “stringency” sets in when that little
community borrows only £2,000,000 or so in a year.
Then Ward puts on a spurt and borrows something
extra to relieve the “ stringency ” ; in the present
case he states proudly that one department alone
is borrowing abroad at the rate of £1,200,000 a
year. In other words, the country drinks a
bottle and a half instead of a mere bottle before
breakfast, and previous to emptying the snakes
out of its boots. • There is only one end to this
sort of thing. When the uneasiness which already
prevails grows into actual alarm, and a scared
money market shuts down for a few years on
Maoriland loans, and through lack of money land
values do the inevitable slump, then the reserve
funds and a heap of the capital of big solid-looking
institutions will dry up in a night, like Jonah’s
herbal umbrella, and dividends will stop, and the
weary job of cleaning up the wreckage will begin
all over again. Then Maoriland will give up
emptying the early-morning snakes out of its
boots. For a while it will have to do without
boots.

Br an old politician :
Though there was apparently some exaggeration and
misrepresentation concerning the doings of the trustees
of Kuringai Chase (N.S.W.), as stated in a recent ex-
posure by Sydney Star, the articles opened a fine
fissure lode. Yet if the writer had devoted his attention
to the National Park, near Port Hacking River, he would
have found a much worse state of things there. It is said
that out of over 30 trustees only about five ever attend
the meetings. The place is run chiefly bv one man, the
chairman, the same as in the case of the Kuringai Chase,
with the difference that Frank Farnell, the dictator at
National Park, is an amiable and conciliatory character,
whereas Jake Garrard, the boss at Kuringai, is one of
the most arrogant and arbitrary men known. Rather
than have no fisrht at all, he would get up a row with.a
circular saw. He is the same man who, during the
Sydney water famine, went round on top of a water cart
to see that the famishing public did not get a gill too much.
He also went around Kuringai Chase in a boat to collect
shilling rents from poor fishermen. The trustees of the
National Park have a great many more privileges than the
trustees of Kuringai Chase, and it would be most
interesting if a return were produced showing how often
they or their friends have used the cottages, launches,
vehicles, etc., without any payment whatever. No
doubt abuses would be found in connection with other
national parks. In fact, the whole system is a farce and a
failure, and the sooner it is taken in hand by the Govern-
ment the better. What is wanted to give satisfaction to
the public with regard to these national parks is a Board
of three young and competent men, well paid, who will
take charge of all the national parks near Sydney, and
administer them vigorously and impartially. Such men
would have to be well paid, and be entrusted with such
powers as would enable them to refuse privileges and con-
cessions to Ministers of the Crown, members of Parlia-
ment, or anyone else, that are not accorded to the general
public. Let them also be supplied with a sufficient
amount of money to keep the roads and other accommo-
dation in repair, and to create such further improvements
as are necessary to make these glorious preserves a real
benefit to the people, the poorest of whom should have
the same rights there as the richest and most influential.

The Margaret Anglin Company played
“Twelfth Night” at the Royal during the
whole of last week. The programme volun-
teered the news that this “is Shakspeare’s
wittiest comedy.” It is not that, but it is some-
thing more. Wit dies for the most part. Humor
in one generation tends to become fustian in the
next. Much of the fun in “ Twelfth Night ” never
had a valid claim on life. It remains unburied
only because it is inseparable from poetry that will
live as long as literature survives. Shakspeare
never wrote of love more deliciously than in this
play. He takes real and charming people for his
sympathetic characters, causes them to adore
each other at first sight for no other reason than
their physical beauty, provides them with lines
of exquisite loveliness, and so weaves round them
an air of wondrous romance. There is an interest-
ing distinction to be drawn between the fantastic
fairy-like atmosphere that is achieved in the
tender passages of “Twelfth Night” and that
which we saw essayed in “Peter Pan” at this
theatre a few weeks ago. Barry fails, even with
children as subjects, to convince when in whimsi-
cally sentimental mood. The onlooker never
escapes the realisation that Peter and Wendy are
only “ making believe.” Shakspeare, in “Twelfth
Night,” places grown-ups in an every-day environ-
ment, and makes them act and speak like immor-
tals. Yet by his art their love-affairs become of
supreme human interest. Because the humor of
“ Twelfth Night ” is so much lumber by compari-
son with the play’s poetry, it is on the romantic
side that the acting of it calls primarily for
criticism.
* * * *
Ifc takes time and thought to grasp why
Miss Anglin was not a satisfactory Viola. None
speaks Shakspeare’s lines with more distinction
than she. Her voice is glorious. She is a subtle
humorist. She indicates love, sorrow, fear, joy,
with consummate art. And yet she stepped out
of the beautiful mediaeval picture again and again
last week, and there remained for minutes at a
time. It seems to the writer that Miss Anglin
suffers from an incorrigible modernity. Her tricks
of fascination are too up-to-date, too sophisticated
for Shakspeare’s Arcadian maid. Her “Twelfth
Night ” allurements were the same allurements
that she exploited with tremendous effect in
“The Truth,” “Zira,” and “The Thief.” The
brow contracted in comic mock-puzzlement,
the coyly-bitten underlip, the half-closed eyes,
rolling now laughingly, now languorously, to right
and left, the hands clasped appealingly before the
chin—they were well and natural enough as
the gestures of Mercy Merrick, Becky Warder
and Marise Voysin, but they sat ill on Viola.
Henry Kolker was a dignified and attractive
Orsino. The two most vital figures in the pro-
duction were Maria and Malvolio. Maria, in
Susie Vaughan’s hands, looked no “youngest
wren of nine,” but she was a most lifelike
sprightly and laughter-compelling creation all the
same. Titheradge, as Malvolio, avoided burlesque
on the one hand and melodrama on the other with
fine restraint and skill. A more interesting bit of
character-portrayal hasn’t been seen hereabouts
for many a year.
* » * *
The Margaret Anglin season ends to-
morrow (Friday) night with “The Thief.”. On
Saturday Julius Knight heaves himself oh the
Royal stage to play “ The Sign of the Cross,” and
despite increasing years he will again pursue
Mercia with agility over the old Roman furniture,
and be defeated by powerfulspiritual influences just
as he is about to run her to earth behind the old
Latin piano. The Early Christians who),'sing
hymns loudly to avoid attracting the attention of
the leggy and callous troops of Rome, are. already
lifting up their voices in rehearsal.
One of the truths that the National
Opera Company’s Criterion season has served to
establish is that there is no bona fide market in
Sydney to-day for good music, however artistically
interpreted. The suburbanite will go to the
Town Hall to hear imported stars, provided they
have been shrewdly boomed beforehand. But it
appears to be in about 80 per cent, of cases a
tribute to reclame and curiosity rather than to
art. The best-to-do class cheerfully buys
guinea seats when artists of European fame
arrive. It calls on these folk, entertains
them, and helps their agents’ work by raving
about them privately, regardless often enough of
the fact that amongst critical audiences the day
of those they idolise is past. The Criterion'
artists have presented half-a-dozen operas in the
last two months. On the whole they havedonetheir
work well. In “Faust” and in “II Trovatore”
they did more than well. With the exception of
Melbd,, Sydney has not heard a soprano in recent
years who rendered the beautiful Gounod and
Yerdi numbers more delightfully than Mrs.
Slapoffski. Emil Greder is a fineactor with a fine
voice. Wilson Pembroke is a better tenor than
the average concert platform star trails in her wake.
Yet week by week the Criterion audiences have
dwindled. It seemed latterly that the more
meritorious the production was, the fewer came to
it. As a result, the company will disband at the
end of the “II Trovatore” run. It constitutes an
awful reflection on the local taste that where an
Albani concert-combination commanded some
thousands, the operatic combination that is now
farewelling has had to close down at a loss.
* * * *
The stars aside, the most interesting per-
formance in “II Trovatore ” is that of Florence
Quinn, a young Australian who plays Azucena.
She possesses a sweet mezzo, which has been
carefully trained. She sings accurately and with
feeling, though her voice is over-light for the role.
Her acting is far above the average grand opera
standard. The chorus and orchestra do well, and
the mounting of the opera is excellent. In fact,
the only valid cause for serious cavil at the Cri.
just now is to be found in the lamentable number
of empty seats that gape in the front of the house.
** * *
J. 0. W. did have the idea of making
“ The Duchess of Dantzig ” the holiday attraction
at Her Majesty’s (Sydney); but Mrs. Bill of
Boggabri and the Misses Bill let J.C.W. know
that Sydney wouldn’t be the same Sydney to
them if he finally married off the tremendously-
advertised Widow before they had a chance to
inspect her, and pass an opinion upon the morals
of Maxim’s. Therefore the Duchess is, so to
speak, marking time ; she is all ready to duch,
but till the Country Cousin has had her way she
won’t be given a chance to do it in public. On
present appearances the Widow will last in Syd-
ney for 13 or 14 weeks—which is a record run for
recent years.
** * *
The unerring accuracy with which Spencer
of Sydney Lyceum hangs his show on the topical
peg of the hour suggests that the manager has at
some time or other been mixed up in the produc-
tion of a newspaper. Spencer’s Theatrescope opens
with “ Christmas from the Birth of Christ to the
Twentieth Century.” The old conventional story
of Bethlehem is done in gorgeous colors, after
which the film moves on to show how the
birth has been commemorated in all ages and by
all people. Then, religious subjects being turned
off, history rushes on, and the tragedy of Char-
lotte Corday shows what happens to a man who
washes himself and allows strange ladies to call on
him in the bathroom. As a solemn warning
against the deplorable practice of washing, this
splendid film is most valuable.

Sydney Tivoli interrupted the profitable
tenor of its way on an afternoon last week to
permit Harry Rickards to warble “In the Bale
Moonlight” and Tommy Burns to publicly assault
his young friend, Bat O’Keefe all in the
sacred cause of charity. Then the old
order was resumed, and now once more
the Marconis are exuding electric flames from
every pore, and the Sisters Reno are dancing, and
Frank and Jen Latona are society-entertaining,
and the money is rolling in at the box-office, and
all is joy and noise and movement and perspira-
tion in and about the Mecca of the artist with the
encarmined nose and the artiste with the over-
developed calves.

West’s Pictures, at Sydney Glaciarium,
continue on their crowded way. From among
the bewildering variety, The Bulletin treasures
a recollection of the fate that overtook an Irish-
man who went to a foreign city and ate horse.
The first symptom was a tendency to spring in
his walk, and to fall on his hands and kick out
at the atmosphere with his legs. Then
he commenced to career wildly down the street
till, finding an unoccupied buggy outside a stable,
he sprang between the shafts and made pace in a
marvellous manner. All records were broken by
that distracted man as he careered along between
the shafts and galloped over women, perambu-
lators and policemen, till he burst into the
yard of the police station. There he was captured
and taken to the hospital, and the remains
of the horse extracted from his internal works.
The Australian audience goes quite mad over the
manoeuvres of the Italian cavalry, which, unless
the film lies —and that is, of course, impossible—
are a very fine body of horsemen. The show con-
cludes with representations of Burns and Johnson
at training operations, which, by the way, are not
nearly so good as other samples of local workman-
ship that have been displayed in Sydney.
** * *
Adelaide amusements are in an odd
position. The slight but very tuneful “ Belle of
Mayfair” was the last thing at the Royal, and
since it gathered up its bed and walked that
house has been empty. The Tivoli closed its
doors about the same time. The Town Hall is
mostly devoted to concerts, among which has
bulked largest the one in honor of Clara Klein-
schmidt, S.A.’s newest contralto. This young
woman has won an Elder scholarship, which
takes her to Europe, and has also the unusual dis-
tinction of being—like the Duke of Blaza Toro-
floated into a limited liability company, which will
philanthropically start her on a career, and then
cannily have an eye on her earnings for some ten
years to come. The other local shows are all
in comparatively new houses, and are all Bictures
—the Bavilion, "Hippodrome, Olympia and Con-
tinental. This last isn’t a “house” at all; it
lives in the Exhibition Gardens, and goes indoors
when it rains (only in an Adelaide December it
doesn’t rain).
** * *
“The Assassin,” which was unchained at
Melbourne King’s on Saturday, is a torrid picture
of Russia in delirium screamens. The local color
is so thick that large clods of it fall off and drop
into the orchestra. But, nowadays, its numerous
perversions and ready strangulation of fact, in-
telligence and reality, are the merest Andersonian
commonplaces. They make no one gasp. Ivan
Ipanoff is the lofty hero of the piece, and is
played by George Cross. Ivan is filled with
lugubriousness and humility. No doubt his
respect for everybody is pleasant, though plenti-
ful ; but it seems overdone. The Countess, who
precipitates Ivan into matrimony, is Miss Duggan
repeating former characters and attired in a suc-
cession of swoons. Frocking appears to be a
POTTED CRITICISM.

Preceded by a curtain-raiser, ‘ ‘ That Brute
Simmons”—which presents the frivolous side of
bigamy, if there is one—“ When Knights were
Bold ” was given a short run at Melbourne Bijou
last Saturday night. The audience, numerically
speaking, wasn’t encouraging. The show, how-
ever, lacked none of its former brightness, and
Sir Guy de Vere lacked none of his'heavenly im-
becility. His insufferable modernness and tastes
for whisky and the mundane present were the
same farcically improper circumstances, and Frank
Thornton gave them fullest value. His beery, eerie
pugnacity as a knight in armor caused roars of
laughter, and his unseemly irreverent prattle, be-
side the elegant language of 1196 A.D., was just as
amusing. Certainly, in his humorous indifference
to the nobility of the past, especially in a castle
reeking with antique associations, he has the
aspects of a thoughtless cad—at least in the
opinion, apparently, of his house party. His
sane detestation of Romance and Age seems to
them the more sacrilegious, because it is delivered
in th*e easy English of a present-day club or
superior pieshop. Thornton makes the most of
that side of the character of de Vere, and is
assisted in heightening the contrast with almost
repousse effects by the subdued work of the
rest of the company. The rest of the
company consists of practically the same people
who were in Melbourne some months back,
and the present writer recognises the well-
remembered portly form of the Rev. Peter
Pottleberry. Peter is chubby, pompous and
seraphic, and after listening to his complacent
stodge, one doesn’t need to eat for a week.

“ The Prisoner of Zenda,” revived at Mel-
bourne Pier Majesty’s on Saturday before last,
proves to be a not very stormy attraction, after
all. Never much of a play, but more particularly
an orgy of red hair and uniforms, its unreality
seems to have thickened with the growing years.
For instance, pomp and magnificence should be
the notable features of a coronation, but nothing
is more strikingly meretricious than the corona-
tion scene in Act 11. Possibly the treasury is
low, owing to the King’s drinking habits; but,
even allowing for that, the display seems ordi-
nary. If Colonel Sapt and Fritz von Tarlenheim
could induce the management to provide them
with extra uniforms for the coronation, it
would be a subject for congratulation. To
such surroundings the bedizened figure of Julius
Knight as the Red Elphberg is appropriate.
As for Miss Beatrice Day, her Princess Flavia is
gracious, but distinctly elderly. She has not the
air of youthfulness shown by Miss Ola Humphrey.
Miss Elsie Wilson plays Antoinette de Maubin
attractively, but with a suspicion of theatricality.
The parts of Duke Wolfgang of the prologue, and
of Black Michael of the play, are taken by Harry
Plimmer in a colorless fashion, trimmed with
jerky elocution. Reynolds Denniston doubles the
parts of the Earl of Rassendyll and of Fritz von Tar-
lenheim, and is more thorough in the former than
in the latter. The Mayor of Strelsau is repre-
sented so earnestly by G. Chalmers, as a pink,
official nincompoop, that he is suspected of having
explored Melbourne’s suburban councils for local
color. Herbert Leigh plays Colonel Sapt as the
Bismarck type of martinet, and Leslie Victor
does the two small parts of Horace Glyn (of the
prologue) and Bertram Bertrand, a stage type of
English artist who .seems to be a compromise
between a clown and a Cook’s tourist.

A six nights’ revival of “ The Belle of New
York” at Melbourne Princess’s enabled The
Bulletin to meet its old friend, lehabod Bronson,
a gentleman for whom it has a powerful though
sneaking regard. He was much the same old in-
genious jim-jam, much the same bestower of ex-
treme unction in leer and language, and, while
the season lasted, much the same golden proposi-
tion to the management. The season, however,
ended on Friday last, and the Princess’s has been
prorogued probably until Boxing Night, when
something is sure to happen.
When the present writer was down at
Wirth’s Park, the other night, Phil Wirth was
evoluting on a fine black stallion, and a pretty
damsel was distributing nourishment to sundry
ferocious animals. Also Guillaume and Josephi,
comedians ; Peter Tourcher’s elephant, and sun-
dry other humans, animals, and inanimate objects
were providing a pleasant sort of circus in a
capsule.

And, in the interval, the pair nmy glide out into

Since The Bulletin last commented upon
the entertainment at Melbourne Opera House
two or three fresh turns have pushed two or three
old turns out. - The McGregors, a trio of con-
certinists and zylophonists, and Duncan’s collie
dogs—the same being well-trained animals —ap-
peared on the Saturday before last. Last
Saturday Mr. Will Haines and Miss Amber
Austa condescended to thrust themselves on public
notice. Mr. Haines is a gentleman with a predi-
lection for niggah melodies and a felicitous violet
suit, and Miss Austa is a lady whose front is
slightly more interesting than her back. She also
has a leaning for niggah tunes, and delivers them
with festive mannerisms that the audience mis-
takes for brilliant eccentricities. She dances, too,
but dances very little. If she danced more and
waved less of her luscious back draperies in the
face of the audience, this paper might forgive her
coming all the way “ from London per s.s.
Salamis ” to do it.
“Henri Singemoine,” on Masonry :
I note with a good deal of interest the uproar that
is going on in the papers anent the Cardinal’s re-
marks about Freemasonry. lam a Mason—for “ Once a
Mason always a Mason.” 'An elderly man—hitherto my
friend —made me his unrelenting foe a few years
ago by badgering me into taking on this in-
sane game. I observe that the Cardinal treats
Freemasonry seriously. It proves conclusively that
there are things the Cardinal doesn’t know. The
oldster aforementioned—my quondam friend—grappled
with me one afternoon in a train. He said: “As one
who knows and likes you, and who knew, liked and
revered your parents, let me implore you to join
my lodge. It is the most aristocratic lodge
in Australia. The benefits that will accrue to
you from joining it are incalculable, though at
present unnameable. You will for ever bless the day
you join my lodge. I am the Worshipful G.M. of it.
Join it, I implore, for your dead parents’ sake, for your
own sake, for my sake, for all our sakes.” He went on
like this for about an hour, at the end of which time I
wilted and said if he put it as strongly as that I would. An
appointment was made and onedreadful night I attended
at the lodge to be initiated. I will not disclose
the asininity that went on for I took an oath
I wouldn’t. When it was over a thick bandage,
which had been wrapped round my eyes and head, was
removed, and I discerned, massed together before me in a
small and stuffy rooty. : (l) my aged friend, looking un-
speakably foolish in agarb that would embarrass a Central
African savage, and with a bared sword in his hand
(he is a produce merchant and a confirmed bowler in
private life) ; (2) my bootmaker, who ceased send-
ing me “to account rendered ” missives, some
months ago, and instead took to despatching in-
sulting and threatening demands for immediate
liquidation of my account; (3) the father of a young
woman with whom I had been friendly the previous year—
he had warned me that if I came near his house again,
or spoke to his child or to him or to any member of the
family, he would direct his bloodhound to tear me to
pieces; (4) about two score. of unknowns. The
next thing I knew, a horde of total strangers
was surrounding me and wringing my hands,
and saying, “Welcome Brother Singemoine, welcome
to the Lodge.” Only the bootmaker and the father
stood aloof, glowering savagely. Speeches followed;
drivelling, doddering speeches about Masonry—which is
to say, about nothing. Then came a supper of lager beer
and cold beef, and more speeches, more drivel, more
dodder.
Two days later I was walking in the street. A blear-
eyed fellow accosted me. “ Good day, Brother Singe-
moine,” he said, warmly, gripping my hand significantly
the while. “I will come to the point quickly. As a
fellow-Mason, I may speak plain. I am in urgent
need of a sovereign. May I ask you as a Mason to oblige ? ”
I compromised for 10s., and hurried on. The next day I
was intercepted while entering my office by another
Mason. He demanded in the name of the craft 30s. I
gave him 12s. 6d. and fell blasphemously upon my daily
labors. A week passed, during which I disbursed a further
£2 ss. to indigent Masons, and then arrived a bill from
the Lodge for £l2 12s. for “ dues.” I sat cataleptic for
some 15" minutes staring at the outrageous thing, and
then I took a cab to the home of the old ruffian who
had brought this sorrow upon me. The law forbids the
publication of the words I said to him. I wound
up thus: “ And now I wish to know if there is
any way short of suicide by which I may
get out of your !** Lodge. If so, I will do it no
matter what it costs.” He seemed surprised ;in fact,
paralysed. “You take it very badly,” he said weakly.
“Don’t you like the Lodge ?” “Like it!” I thundered.
“ Where’s the sense in the blanky thing? Do you take
me for a Benevolent Asylum? Do you imagine that I’m
going to disburse quantities of good gold to see a
few of you make crimson idiots of yourselves in the
presence of a herd of chronic tappers?” It seemed to
convince him. Anyhow, he said I might resign, and so
avoid |further lodge meetings—though he explained
that I couldn’t cease being a Mason, and that I would
have to stump up the £l2 12s. for my “dues.” I paid the
money, sent in my resignation, and received my release.
When such sense of the ludicrous as I possess becomes
totally atrophied; when I have hours to spare for the
practise of unprofitable tomfoolery, and when my yearly
income is thrice what it is at present, I may consider the
question of going a-Masoning once nlore. Till then, cer-
tainly not.

AT POVERTY POINT.
Sydney saw “ Struck Oil ” for the first time at the now-
defunct Queen’s Theatre, York-street, on 10th March,
1875, with the following cast: John Stofel, J. 0. William-
son ; Deacon Skinner, Win. Andrews ; Sergeant Flynn,
Wm. J. Holloway ; Dr. Brown, Bussell; Corporal, T.
Lewis; Officer of the Day, J. Dunn, Jr.; Pete Bowley,
J. H. Martin ; Billy, Master Wilson ; Katrina, Mrs. Wool-
ridge ; and Lizzie Stofel, Maggie Moore. The piece ran
44 nights, a long run for those days. Chas. Wheatleigh
was showing at the same time in “ The Shaughraun” at
the old Vic., in Pitt-street, and he piled up 40
nights, which was not bad, considering the oppo-
sition. Boucicault’s piece was then new to Syd-
ney, and was cast thus: Conn, Chas. Wheatleigh;
Captain Molineaux, H. N. Douglas; Bobert Ffoliett,
J. H. Bainford; Father Doolan, J. G. Joyce; Corry
Kinchela, B. N. Jones ; Harvey Duff, J. J. Welsh ; Claire
Ffolliett, Adelaide Bowring; Moya, Tilly Andrews;
Bridget, Docy Mainwaring. Williamson and Maggie
Moore followed up “Struck Oil” with productions of
“ Uncle Tom’s Cabin ” (with J.C. as the Quaker, Phineas
Fletcher), “Bip Van Winkle," “Kerry,” “The Chinese
Question,” and “Our German Cousins.”
Miss Ola Humphrey’s last appearance with the com-
pany of Julius Enormous was marked by the ovations of
a thin house. Few had the courage to face a procession
of emblazoned platitudes such as “The Lady of Lyons”
affords, just to “ so-long” the popular, sweet-voiced lady.
But those that had the courage made enough noise to
induce a suspicion that they held proxies for thousands
of absentees. They banged their hands mightily, and,
at the end, declared a dividend of four vegetable trophies.
Julius rescued the greenery and subtly-ribboned basket
work; which done, he placed them at the feet of the star,
and then retired, leaving the smiling lady in full enjoy-
ment of his limelight. Such heroic unselfishness can
Julius display on occasion.
“Melb.”: Again “ The Lady of Lyons.” I suppose no
play has been acted so often in this city, as it goes back
far before the birth of “East Lynne,” and was a prime
favorite in the generation before last. Coppin and his
company, from Launceston, made their first appearance
in it at the Queen’s Theatre, in 1845. The next night they
acted “The School for Scandal." Coppin told me that,
looking back through the mist of years, he still remem-
bered Young’s Melnotte as excellent. Mrs. Coppin had
been Mrs. Watkins Burroughs, wife of a Dublin manager.
Mr. and Mrs. Coppin made their first Australian appear-
ance in the play of “ Evadne, or the Hall of Statues,” at
the Sydney Victoria.
“ Bloggs”: The Ormiston Chants, who have been visit-
ing these parts, bear a name that was as notable once in
the theatrical as it still is in the pietistic world. A dozen
years ago London music halldom rang with the name of
Ormiston Chant. The disturbance was caused by Mrs.
Laura of that ilk, mother of the young man who has just
departed aboard the Oruba. She waged unceasing and
venomous war against (1) the practice of selling intoxi-
cants of all sorts in the halls ; (2) the pervasiveness of the
Florence type of citizeness in those places. Night
after night for many months did she brave the
horrors of the Empire and Alhambra “ lounges.’’ Varied
and most hideous were the experiences that she endured
there and published, subsequently, in the religious press.
Licentious men-about-town accosted her in the execution
of her duty, and offered her “ wine,” which—considering
that she was over 50 at the time and unalluring withal—
indicates the infernal hardihood of these outcasts. She
saw and recorded horrors during her efforts at reforming
the West End of London that made the hairs of many a
worthy non-Vaudeville-frequenting Methody uprear
themselves and quiver with pain. For a couple of years
she secured an astonishing amount of public attention.
Then she simmered down and was no more heard of out-
side a limited circle. She achieved nothing. The London
“ hall ” is still the most inebriated and Florence-
frequented hall on this naughty old globe.
“E.F.”: Fifty forgotten revivals of “Katharine and
Petruchio ” in Melbourne might be discovered from the
records —programmes, newspaper cuttings, etc. —which
the late William Marshall, the printer, delighted to
collect, and which are now preserved as curiosities at the
office of J. J. Miller. Garrick’s version of “ The Taming of
the Shrew” was so popular in the past that its long
absence from the stage is unaccountable. Among the
old-time actors, one of the most persistent Petruchios
was Henry Neil Warner. For instance, he played the
part at the original Melbourne Princess’s in 1857,
and again at the same house in 1859, when Miss
Avonia Jones made a farewell appearance as
Katharine. Everybody who was anybody of importance
had a go at the Garrick-Shakspeare farce, and made
a special feature of it at times. And even “ The Taming
of the Shrew,” or an edition of it not more abbreviated
than Miss Anglin’s, was produced at Melbourne Boyal in
1864. There must have been a steady demand for the
spectacle of a man roaring, bullying and starving his
bride into a state of joyful submission. Seemingly there
is still a lot of money in it. Men relish the “moral”
lesson, and women mostly like to imagine themselves the
willing slaves of a good-looking (and substantially
amorous) Petruchio, although actually five out of six of
them would take out a police-court summons against him,
and crush him with their neighbors’ indignation.
Albani has gone on the music-hall stage. She starts
on a two weeks’ engagement at the Pavilion
Theatre of Varieties, Glasgow. It is becoming the
fashion for the vocal top-notcher to take to vaudeville
when her or his concert-platform “ punch ” is irretriev-
ably mislaid. The artistic slump is made up for by the
resulting financial rise.
George Wombwell, the founder of “ Wombwell’s Great
Menagerie,” and in his day one of the most famous show-
men on earth, is now, at the age of 90 and odd, an inmate
of the Edmonton Workhouse (England). A sudden and
baffling disease smote his live stock a few years ago, and
the animals died off like Bombay plague subjects.
Within six months Wombwell lost £4OOO worth of
man-eating quadrupeds. Four hyaenas expired in
a single night. The next day £5OO worth of
elephant crashed to earth and never arose. Also
many of his trick horses and ponies forded the Styx
with horrid suddenness and an air of mystery. When
the hand of Death was lifted from the tents of Woinhwell,
their owner was a disheartened and financially broken
man. He got a fresh stock together on borrowed money,
but his old “ drive ” was gone. The Mysterious Horror of
the past haunted him unceasingly. His nerve had left
him. He had lost his punch. He felt that the priceless
carnivora that were here to-day might be on the Zoo
carcase cart to-morrow, and so he let things slide. It is
a sad and unusual end for one who neither drank,
smoked, nor swore at any period of his life, and was
wont to take over £2OO a night at the box office when in
his prime.
“Joh”: A weird and wonderful bellow-drama was re-
cently let loose at Wainoni Park, Christchurch (M.L.).
Wainoni, by the way, is owned by an interesting genius,
Professor Bickerton, who in bygone times taught star-
gazing at Canterbury College, until he discovered that
worlds are manufactured by impact. Then an over-
religious Board of Governors fired him into outer dark-
ness with a loud bang. Such strenuous belief in the
first chapter of Genesis led the Professor to let his
grounds and residence for pleasure garden purposes. So
to Wainoni in the summer is carted the Sunday-school
kid, who has been good for 12 weary months, and there
he receives the reward of excessive virtue in the shape of
stale buns and ginger-pop. Other people also go to Wai-
noni. But to get back to the open-air bellow-drama.
Its title is “ Captured by Cannibals,” and it is presented
in five aots. A trading schooner from Melbourne strikes
a coral reef, and becomes a wreck. The crew and the
captain’s daughter land on the cannibal island, and are
surrounded by savages. The captain’s daughter implores
her lover to kill her, but before he can do so a cannibal
lassoes him, much to the disappointment of the audience.
The bo’sun is killed, and put into the cooking pot, but
the captain escapes and effects a rescue, aided by a body
of British soldiers, who were evidently hanging about
the island looking for work, or had been driven out of
Australia by Socialistic legislation. This blood-curdler,
evidently based on some of “ Hop’s ” missionary pictures,
is badly written, awfully staged, and ferociously acted.
It must surely be the limit.
“ Cockaigne ” : Sir Charles Young, author of “ Jim the
Penman," wasted a lot of good paper and ink over the
Drama, but could never make a success before “Jim,”
and he does not seem to have tried after. He had money
and spilled it on play after play. He tried to wreathe
his earlier efforts round Mrs, Hermann Vezin, as leading
actress. She was formerly Mrs.. Charles Young. Mr. and
Mrs. C. Young were in the company brought by Coppin
from Launceston to Melbourne in 1845. They went to
England about 15 years after, and were divorced. Mrs.
Young was the (traditional) lady at whom nuggets were
flung m the Melbourne Queen's. When Mrs. Vezin be-
came rather passd, Sir Charles Young wrote for Lady
Monckton, wife of the London Recorder, or Town Clerk.
She got the plum of “Jim the Penman," where the
woman lead is decidedly the best. The original Jim
the Penman was Dacre, who suicided in Sydney. Good
enough, but not so good as Willard, who replaced him.
“D.J.”: A consideration of the humor of “Twelfth
Night ” and “ The Taming of the Shrew ” reminds me that
the Smart Set in every epoch has gone in for practical
joking to a powerful extent. A French, English or
American house-party of this century, if it could be pro-
jected back to mediaeval times, would revel in the befool-
ing of the wretched Malvolio. In addition to sending him
fake letters, the guests would undoubtedly put irritants
in his cross-gartered hose, drug his sack, and sew up
the legs of what stood, in those way-back days, for
pyjamas. Also it would apple-pie his pallet, and poise
booby-traps over every portcullis for his especial
benefit. A modern noble appreciates to the full the
comprehensive fashion in Which Petruchio drags the
understanding of his Katharine. He would do it
himself to perfection. A little differently perhaps
(since other times bring other leg-pullings), but he
would get there all the same. It seems to be a social
axiom that wherever people find themselves with time on
their hands and plenty to eat, they take to practical
joking. Even the brainy romanticists who gathered round
George Sand in the early part of last century—Madames
Recamier and D’Agoult, and Liszt, Heine, Chopin and Sue
—were infected with the “ ragging ” virus. When Eugene
Pelletan—father of the present-day Camille Pelletan—
came to stay at Nobantfor the first time, a housemaid was
forced to masquerade as Madame Sand. To her the aged
dupe bowed low, and murmured compliments on her
genius, while the real Sand and her friends watched
delightedly from under tables and sofas. When, how-
ever, one of the guests persisted in shamming drunken-
ness, and weeping profusely over Pelletan’s stainless
shirtfront the victim grew “ shirty,” and at last packed
his traps and left. Everywhere, in all the ages, well-to-do
people are to be identified making silly asses of their
friends to the accompaniment of roars of laughter. It
appears to be the one humor-form that renders Time,
with his allegedly corroding grinders, in need of the
dentist’s attention.
“ Jean S.” : One or two of the Melbourne theatres are
getting exceedingly casual in their starting hours. There
was a time when the curtain curled up at eight sharp,
but now it is not uncommon to see the orchestra wander
out about 8.5, and plough languidly through the over-
ture, what time the “quality” are crawling in massive
indolence to their seats in the circle. The “quality,” I
may mention, are never very obvious until about 8.5 p.m.
Possibly this lack of punctuality is of great assistance to
those luxurious persons who have to pack a monstrous
late dinner behind hard boiled shirts and powerfully-
built corsets, but it makes other people, who feed earlier
and more sensibly, very, very angry. Further, one can
always be certain that a late start portends not only bad-
ness, but brevity. The other night, I wandered into a
certain Melbourne theatre, which was looking tired. The
curtain uprose at 8.13 p.m. ; there were three intervals,
aggregating about 25 minutes in all; and the show had
finished by 10.35 p.m. And it was a darned bad show.
According to Austin Brereton, who has just published
a biog. of Henry Irving, the latter’s stage earnings from
1878, when he became established as a successful actor,
to 1905 amounted to £2,261,637, and his expenses during
the same period totalled £2,168,290. More than half the
takings came from London performances, about one-
third from his eight American tours, and the balance
from trips in the English provinces. Irving left only a
few thousands, for, in addition to his lavish expenditure,
he gave away large sums as pensions to out-at-elbows
mummer acquaintances of his early days. During his
career he played 671 different parts, 428 of which he
studied during his first 2£ years, while with provincial
stock companies. Incidentally Brereton mentions that
during the last few years of her service with Irving,
Ellen Terry got £lOO per week in London, £2OO during
the provincial wanderings, and £3OO on the American
tours.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Oh, damn the sons' that Mary sings,
And the organ-grinder’s grinding,
And the flat piano they play next door,
And the violin on the back first floor,
And all the squawky, rhythmical things
That tickle the soul and blast its wings
While the poet his rhymes is finding.
My verse is gone in a howl of pain
As they wrangle, bump and batter ;
I hate the phonograph’s nasal twang,
And the tins the marching urchins bang,
For they get on the nerves, and they get in the brain,
Till thought is idle and language vain,
And my beautiful day-dreams scatter.
For this is the fiend’s own truth I tell,
A fact beyond disputing ;
I lived as a poet long ago,
Bad as a poet should be, you know,
Till down with a sounding thump I fell
To the hot first floor of the bottomless hell,
Where musical devils were tooting.
And this is hell, you will all agree,
The hell of a bard’s endeavor,
To see for ever a glimpse of things,
To wave for ever the stumps of wings,
While the bang and rattle on land and sea
Bump all the melody out of me
For ever and ever and ever.

MAGNIFICENT JEWELS, VALUE £lO,OOO -Messrs.
William Farmer & 00., Vice-Regal Jewellers, 30 Hunter
Street, S3'dney, have been fortunate in securing an exten-
sive order for (2) magnificent suites, one all diamonds,
the other emerald and diamonds, jewellery to the value
of £lO,OOO. The jewels are considered the finest in the
Commonwealth, and are for a prominent lady in Sydney
society. The suite consists of a fine collection of choice
gems, mounted in the newest French designs, the front
of the handsome diamond necklet consisting of five beau-
tiful drops, and the back a row of fine diamonds. There
are two pendants, one consisting of a large cluster of
Jagerfontein diamonds with a blue diamond drop, and
the other pendant an emerald surrounded in diamonds,
and a further row of large diamonds of magnificent
quality. The emerald pendant is valued at £2OOO. There
are two fine stars, one all diamonds and one emerald and
diamonds, both of highest quality gems. There is a
smaller diamond necklet to wear with either pendant.
An emerald and diamond brooch of beautiful design and
fine quality adds greatly to the suite, and a fine spray of
diamonds for the hair is also very effective. The brace-
lets consist of one all fine large diamonds, and the other a
fine emerald surrounded and mounted in good taste with
brilliant diamonds. There are two other bangles in
diamonds of nice designs. A handsome pear shape
emerald drop pendant is among the jewels. The suite is
quite in keeping with the high-class firm of Messrs.
William Farmer & Co.’s reputation, and it is of great
credit to have such established firms in the Common-
wealth.

Tangled reminiscences by The Bulletin’s
“Oldest Inhabitant ”
Re Belmont Chambers, recently erected by Captain
Charley, in Castlereagh-street, Sydney. In 180 S Lieu-
tenant Archibald Bell, at the head of his braves of the
Rum-selling Corps, stormed old Government House with
orders from Colonel Johnston to assist in the arrest of
Governor Bligh, and bring him to durance vile in the old
barracks in George-street. It was in 1803 that Archibald
Bell, of the N. S. Wales Corps, came Australia-wards, with
a detachment of exiles. He brought a wife and small
family. With other officers of the corps he .went to
'England to attend the court-martial on Colonel
Johnston, but he was not wanted as a witness,
and returned to New South Wales. Colonel O’ConnelTs
73rd Regiment replaced the Rum-selling Corps, but many
officers and men were allowed to remain and become
members of a force locally raised and known as The
Veterans. Amongst them was Archibald Bell, who settled
on the Hawkesbury, four miles from Richmond. This pro-
perty he named Belmont, or Bell’s Mount, In the grounds
there stands—or stood some 10 years ago—a quaint old
tombstone, which is described as being then shaded by
oleanders and lichen-covered. The monument bears no
name, but beneath it is known that “ Old Archie Bell,”
his wife and his grand-daughter lie.
A son, Archibald Bell, following Blaxland, Lawson and
Wentworth . set out on an expedition of his own across
the Blue Mountains, and discovered a path which is still
known as Bell’s Line. The Belmont of Archibald Bell is
now the Belmont Park of Captain Philip Charley, who
breeds, or did breed, polled cattle. Captain Charley
bought the Castlereagh-street site from the late Monty
Faithfull, who became possessed of it by virtue of his
being one of the trustees of the old Sydney Club. Lieu-
tenant Bell, before Bligh’s time, had a bit of land near
the Tank Stream, but was induced to exchange it for a
piece in Macquarie-street, underneath the present Houses
of Parliament. Macquarie built his medical officers’
quarters on the site. In 1871 this writer was sitting in
the gallery of the Legislative Assembly when some
member was urging the right of the Bell family to com-
pensation. James Byrnes, of Parramatta, was Minister
for Works at the time, and assented to a sum of £lOOO
being voted. Mr. Byrnes, who was the son of a soldier,
persisted in calling the old Belmont man Lew tenant Bell.
Mr. George Cox, of Mulgoa, married a daughter of Lieu-
tenant Bell, a tall, commanding woman, who was the
mother of the late G. H. Cox, M.L.C.

“ Q.F.C.” writes :• —
There has been trouble in the Defence Department
because the military mechanics at Victoria Barracks,
Melbourne, have been doing work in Government time
and with Government materials for officers who could
well afford to pay for having it done outside. But why
does not the Military Board put an end once for all to the
soldier-servant scandal ? It has been laid down in orders
times out of number that soldiers are not to be used as
orderlies, except for strictly military duty. Playing the
part of housekeeper and general help to bachelor officers,
polishing the boots, cleaning the knives, looking after the
flower-garden, and running domestic messages for the
married officers and their wives and families—these are
not the jobs that Australia pays artillerymen to do.
Not very long ago the officer in charge of a certain
out-station earned the cordial dislike of all who did the
goose-step under him by his methods in this regard. He
would send a man a three-mile walk to the store for half-
a-pound of butter; then, when the cow-grease was
brought, he would remember that he wanted some tea
from the same store; and when that commission was
executed the bedizened ruffian would growl at his ex-
hausted pedestrian—who, bv-the-bye, had missed his
breakfast while he was running messages—because he
appeared on parade with his boots dusty or with some
other defect in his turn-out, though the defects arose
from the fact that the time Private Smith should have
spent in cleaning his kit had been taken up in performing
the duties of kitchen-maid and errand-boy. This parti-
cular officer person was justly suppressed ; but other
things nearly as bad are going on in every State. If
Defence Minister Pearce wants to earn the gratitude of
the gunners, he will go into this question personally, and
do it in an unkind spirit.

The softgoods warehousemen of Flinders-
lane, Melbourne, are departing from the grand
old commercial principle that work is its own
reward. One firm has now been publicly accused
of insisting upon every employee taking a
salary. Youths, who have clearly no tit[e
to wages, and wouldn’t want them if they
had a title, are, after five years’ service,
receiving as much as £1 per week. One
magnate, after three years’ gentle re-
creation (marking shoddy as “all wool,”
or something like that), has risen to the
splendor of 12s. 6d. per week, and has
no doubt bought a steam yacht and
country seat. Another, a young
Sybarite of 22, has spent five years’
leisure within the emporium; he has,
according more or less to his bankers,
an assured income of £52 per annum.
His hobbies are said to be racehorses,
rare pictures, and landed estates.
Yet another, a married man of 30,
has . sited the worry of a whole 275.
6d. a week by endowing hospitals
and asylums. Quite a whole crowd
more have taken to senseless indulg-
ences—freak banquets, jewelled foun-
tain pens, etc. Presumably the above
referred-to firm has violated an honor-
able compact. There was, it is alleged,
an understanding amongst the “ Lane”
bosses to pay their employees a maxi-
mum of nothing and a minimum of some-
thing less, with the worthy object of encouraging
work for work’s sake,

Westralia still has a mouth of its own.
A while ago, Fremantle, the droughty port of
Perth, had a teetotal Mayor, who, moreover,
looked upon tobacco with no enthusiasm at all;
and to celebrate his appointment and its own
progress along the road to reform, the council,
during the first three months of the new “dry”
man’s term, " consumed 18 cases of champagne (at
115 s. per case), 1000 cigars, 900 cigarettes,” and
other trifles to match. It seems that among the
Fremantle municipality’s “permanent and repro-
ductive undertakings ” are 30doz. champagne
glasses, and the Fremantle council seems to have
resolved that this asset, anyhow, should be made
to earn its keep.
THE PLUNGER.
THE BOY'S MOTHER: “ Charley, dear, didn't I overhear you tell that man that you were going

THE BOY'S MOTHER : “ Well, Pm glad to hear it. I’d so much rather you went swimming
than went to the races.”
Ten N.S.W. inhabitants had a near shave
of the hereafter the other day, when a runaway
train started down to the Zigzag on the Blue
Mountains. The ten were in a carriage attached
to a heavy goods train that had negotiated the
Zigzag itself, and was puffing through the long Clar-
ence tunnel. The train being too heavy for the
engine, it was divided by the train crew, but by some
mischance, the brakes failed to act, and the rear
half of the outfit started backwards to the Zig-
zag. The occupants of the carriage didn’t
dare to jump while in the tunnel, and when
the train emerged they didn’t dare to jump,
because a train that is doing 60 miles an
hour isn’t healthy to jump from. The trucks
passed the first set of points all right. Then the
pointsman at the lower set, leading on to the Zig-
zag itself, beheld an apparition approaching at
anything up to 100 miles an hour. He had one
moment to decide whether to let the runaway
dash into a waiting train on the main lipe
or to turn it off on to the. siding, where
it would either pile itself up on the “dead
end ” or jump over into the valley below.
He turned the points. The carriage passed safely,
and also the first few trucks. Then a truck
jumped, and the rest following acted like a brake
on the passenger carriage, and it pulled up
within a few yards of the dead end. Unfortu-
nately one truck pitched over on top of the guard
of the stationary train and killed him. Other-
wise no one was hurt. It was a crowded moment on
Johnson’s railway, and but for the pointsman’s
nerve there would have been 10 deaths for certain.

The allegedly “ materialised” Babylonian
bricks, and old Chinese clothes, and other rubbish
which Bailey, the Melbourne spiritualist, has
been catching in the air and presenting to a circle
of believers in a dim light, are among the ancient
jokes of the ghost-raising profession. No one
■outside the harmless little mob of believers would
have taken any notice of them but for the threat
of the Customs Department to charge duty on the
weird collections —a perfectly legitimate proceed-
ing if they really came direct from Babylon or
China, but quite unjustifiable if they were mere
- frauds bought in a Melbourne Johnny-all-sorts em-
porium. The episode advertised Bailey and his
crowd, though it was in itself an affair of no great
interest. But the discussion which ensued was
brightened up a little by an unbeliever, who
wrote to the press, asking for the 20,000 th time if
the spirits would oblige by “materialising” this
morning’s London Times. Ever since the present
scribe remembers, people have been imploring
the spirits to “materialise” to-day’s Lon-
don Times in Calcutta, or to-day’s Times
of India in London, and the spirits have
never done it. Why the spirits so consistently
refuse is hard to explain, except on the assumption
that the spirits ought to get three months for
vulgar imposture. The test would be a reliable
and satisfactory one. The alleged Babylonian
brick and the Chinese old clo’ might have arrived
by any ordinary means of transit, but the London
•Times of December 17,1908, couldn’t be in Sydney
on December 17, 1908, by any ordinary method of
locomotion, and it would be only necessary to put
that paper on view in the N.S.W. capital on the
day of publication and the whole community would
be converted, and the collection would run to
£lOO,OOO at least. Yet the medium never does
this simple act. He still waves his hands in the
air and reaches down old dead bricks which he
says came from Babylon, and old dead pants
which he says have flown direct from China ; but
these things have, no dates on them, and their
alleged flying powers can’t be verified worth a
cent.
A man who died in Britain the other day
had the curious distinction of being the champion
salmon-fly caster of the world. He was one of those
extraordinarily violent persons who trudge about
watercourses throwing into the liquid a lump of
leaded string attached to a piece of tree. At that
exhilarating pastime he beat all comers at Harlem
Lake, New York, where he actually jerked the
twine a distance of 42yds. He also held the British
record for a single-handed cast of 34yds. 2ft., and
was alleged to have made, on one occasion, a cast
of 50yds. So he didn’t live in vain after all.

none the less, and in no State has the insanitary
transgressor got to run harder to keep ahead of re-
tribution when the Health Department gets on his
track with anything like a workable statute in its
hand. After throwing the slops and bones into
the street with impunity for nearly a century, this
is an exciting experience for the Tassy Islander.
Dr, Elkington has just produced another annual
report of his Department. It is written with an
axe and illustrated with inspiriting photographs of
dirty premises. The names of the owners are not
given; in this respect the law wants amending,
for the name of the owner of dirty premises ought
always to be given. Also he should be photo-
graphed with a decayed cow’s liver in his hand,
standing alongside his dirty premises. There are
some good, solid results to show for Dr. Elking-
ton’s toil. Consider these figures as a sample :
Deaths among Children Aged One Year or Less for
Every 1000 Births.
Hobart. Launceston. Rest of Island.
1898 .. 137 205 100
1907 .. 112 96 75
The present figures are far from being what they
should be, but the improvement on the awful
record of 10 years ago is something marvellous.
CORPSE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Two dead bodies .... abandoned shaft.... gory finger-
print .... mutilated and battered .... bloodstained hair
adhering .... almost overpowering odor .... gaping
wound, etc.— Salient points of many charnel-house
columns from Rushworth, in Victorian newspapers.
There’s a simmer of excitement in the land,
And the sinking take fresh interest in life,
For a Foot has been discovered, and a Hand,
Likewise a rusty treacherous-looking' Knife.
Now people have got something to discuss
Throughout Victorian cities, towns and thorps ;
They are full of agitation and of fuss,
And the theme of all their argument is Corpse.
The Almost-Severed-Head is powerful still
To set a shudd’ring populace agog.
And the Bloody-Paper-Wrapping gives a thrill
That would make the neck-hairs bristle on a dog.
The Missing Face in interest never fails ;
The Mutilated Trunk is then disclosed ;
And there’s infinite delight in reading tales
Of the Nether-Portions-Greatly-Decomposed.
See where the happy schoolboy sits and spells
His story from the papers fresh and hot,
His nostrils wide to catch Suspicious Smells,
His ears alert to hear the Fatal Shot.
Go to the kitchen ; mark how Mary Ann,
Oblivious of the salt,the stewpot lacks,
Sits straining both her watery eyes to scan
The Spattered Brains upon the lethal Axe.
Oh, sift the Gruesome Relics bit by bit,
That people may be fed with morsels sweet,
And hawk the Corpse about, nor once omit
The Sight the Gaze was Horrified to Meet.
Forget not, too, the Odor that betrayed
The neighborhood of hidden Deeds of Gore,
Nor let the hungry readers be afraid—
That Corpse will last out still a few days more.

“Bomerah,” the finely-situated house at
Potts Point, Sydney, the name whereof has been
figuring in the N.S.W. courts, the Federal Court,
and the Privy Council during many years, was
once a centre of art, music, and dramatic en-
thusiasm. William McQuade, who built the
house, thought nothing of money, and he and
Cecily, his wife, devised the premises with a
lavish hand. But William died. The Government
: resumed part of the water front. Mrs. Cecily and
executors insisted that it must take all or nothing,
and “Bomerah” entered on a career of litiga-
tion which has been a Pactolus to lawyers. In
the meantime the mansion has been degraded into
a hash tower.
THE CAUTIOUS CORYPHEE.
KITTY (of her new boy): “Do you think it's all
right, girls! His father owns a large cattle
station, he says, and has made everything
over to him."
DOLLY: “I don't know, Kitty. That probably
means the old man has given him the run.”
Prosy old Governor Macquarie cultivated
what in his time was considered an excellent
taste in the matter of New Year’s presents. It
was his custom to have a tent erected in Hyde
Park, nearly opposite what is now St. Mary’s
Cathedral, and for two hours on New Year’s Day
he sat in that tent with a map of Sydney on his
knees, and presented allotments of land to all and
sundry who touched forelocks to him. These were
his New Year’s gifts as Governor. The allot-
ments were small, and the bulk of the people
would have preferred a bottle of rum, but Mac-
quarie foresaw the future, and exhorted the re-
ceivers to stick to the property. Some thrifty
people saw as far as the Governor, and so a hus-
band, wife, and one or two children would each
obtain an allotment, and thus make up a small
family estate. The majority, however, sold their
gifts next day for a few shillings, which fact when
reported made his Excellency sick at heart. As a
believer in Close Settlement there were points
about Governor Mac.
GRANNY TESTIFIES.
Sydney Telegraph cordially approves of the proposed coalition for immigration purposes between the Wade
(N.S.W.) Ministry and the Salv'army.
GRANNY : “ Wear the Army collar and the tic,
And labor will be cheaper by-an'-bye.”
CHORUS OF FAT: “ Alley-too-yer!”
“Edyson” : Every now and again some
interested person or persons shake up the agita-
tion against Sunday buryings in Melbourne, and
out of my sadness I am compelled to enter a
protest. There is positively nothing moving on
Sunday in Melbourne but the hearse, and if sacer-
dotal rage against a Continental Sabbath leads to
the abolition of Sunday burial quite a large num-
ber of respectable, right-thinking citizens, like
myself, will be left absolutely without resource.
As it is, the only possible Sunday relaxation for
prudent Melbournians who do not drink on the
Day of Rust is attending interments—their
ov/n, or those of their friends or even
those of complete strangers whose names
they don’t know; and if we are to be robbed
of this innocent recreation I and many
others want to hear what the Sabbatarians have
to offer us in exchange. Their Pleasant Sunday
Afternoons are too dull, the average sermon is
less edifying than the burial service, and a funeral
has the advantage over a prayer meeting that it
offers driving exercise. Having made Melbourne
too oppressively stupid to live in on the Sabbath,
I insist that the Puritans leave us the privilege of
being buried on that blessed day.

Horace and Algernon are once more
suffering the pangs of composition in connection
with the pay they are enabled to snare in
warehouses and shops. They are telling Mel-
bourne through the press on what poor salaries
they have maintained a cultured taste in
pants, socks, and fancy waistcoats, and are
speaking with great frankness upon the rot-
tenness of their lots ; but on another most
vital subject they seem needlessly
secretive. For instance, they do
not supply any information upon
their neglect of their own organi-
sation, the Shop Assistants’
I Union. They do not say how
the S.A.U. has failed to get
Wages Boards, simply because
Horace and Algernon are either
too craven or too dashed
superior to give it the support
of their membership. They
mention none of those things.
They merely howl in a large,
irresponsible way about the evil
of their circumstances, and don’t
give even a cent’s worth of thought
to the hard-working but pitifully
small union that is almost bursting
to improve their status. Of course,
should the union obtain for them
better hours and wages, they won’t refuse to
participate in the benefits that they haven’t
helped to bring about. Algernon and Horace
aren’t built on those lines.

An interesting paragraph from the Bbitish
Australasian (London) :
A sentiment almost unknown in Australia, but existing
in England, is that based on the conception that there is
a lower order which must be kept in subjection at all
costs in the inter sts of society. The law as at present
administered enables this view to be carried into effect.
In country districts the magistracy is chiefly recruited
from the “ landed gentry,” and the sentences they impose
for such crimes as “illegal pursuit of game” and
“ vagrancy ” enable one to understand the transportation
days. Lately a starving old man was sentenced to be
flogged as a vagrant, a sentence which was upset on
appeal to the Home Secretary. What justice is like in
the country districts can be imagined when we find that
even in London sentences are imposed quite in the old
spirit. For instance, a laborer was lately sentenced to
three years’ imprisonment for stealing 2d. worth of
potatoes.
Flogging as a remedy for poverty is a thing of
old standing in England. After the confiscation
of the property of the guilds and the other gigan-
tic? steals of Henry VIII.’s day had filled England
with beggars, a stupendous effort was made to put
down poverty by flogging, branding, hanging,
and selling into slavery on the plantations of what
is now the United States. Flogging was always
tried first, and though there is no recorded in-
stance in which it removed impecuniosity, still the
fact that it removed a good deal of skin from the
back showed clearly that it was a remover of some
kind. On the strength of this fact, the hope that
it would remove poverty was never quite aban-
doned ; in fact, it lingers to this day.
“J.”: One of the humors of modern
civilisation is the vice-president list of the average
Sydney swimming club. A record of the Waverley
S. C.’s vice-presidents is before me as I write. It
is a portentous thing, containing enough names
to stock the “those present” tally of a Gaud
Mayor’s Town Hall
“At Home.” All
sorts and conditions
of Waverley citizens
are represented in
it, from Willy Kelly
down to the young
gentlemen who serve
on his election com-
mittees; from
Colonel Onslow,
famed for his con-
tempt of the ranker
and for his hauteur
generally, to the pet-
tiest of traders ;
from the Mayor of
Waverley (he of the
foot-to-skull bath-
ing garb) to citb
zens who could
not notch one vote
as alderfolk were
their lives to de-
pend on it. It
costs anything
from ss. to a guinea .
to be unanimously elected
vice-president of a swimming
club. The wisdom of the club in
snaring all the people it can is, in the cir-
cumstances, readily understandable. What puzzles
the outsider is why the Vices take on the job at
the price. There is no glory in it, as almost
everybody who hasn’t been in gaol several times
is vice-president of a swimming club these days;
and the office carries with it no free drink or other
material privilege. In the near future I foresee
an accused person putting forward as a reason
why he should not be proclaimed a “habitual
offender,” the fact that he is Vice of a suburban
S.C. —and failing miserably.

“ Pole Star” on a scientific subject, about
which this paper is dubious :
H. C. Bussell, late Government Meteorologist of N.S. W.,
is best remembered by his strong advocacy of a weather-
cycle theory. He showed (or thought he did) by a series
of charts that the weather conditions of Australia seemed
to repeat themselves every 19 years. This theory was
revived last August, when N.S. W. was deluged with rain,
and Sydney had 14 wet days running ; for it was found
that the last big storm comparable with it occurred in
1889. Unfortunately for Bussell, he remembered that
the movements of the moon are also subject to
a 19-year cycle, and he consequently blamed the
moon for the weather. Now, science won’t stand
mixing up the moon with the weather, as the lunar influ-
ence on the terrestrial atmosphere is demonstrably nil.
So Bussell’s 19-year idea was outed. Subsequent study
has shown that a 19-year cycle is operating in S’African
weather. Icebergs in the Antarctic Ocean and the floods on
the Nile also seem to work on a 19-year time-table. Now
it is argued that all these meteorological phenomena are
due to one cause, and the London Geographical Society has
been thrashing it out. The ancients have apparently
proved to their own satisfaction that the 19-year cycle is
a solemn fact. Yet Bussell missed the ’bus ; and he did
it in this way. The rirth whizzes round on its axis every
24 hours. This roAtion causes winds, and they are
divided at the Equator into the N.-E. Trades and the
S.-E. Trades. Between is the Belt of .Oa I ins. This Belt
controls the weather ; but, like everything else, it can’t
stop still. Its latitude is always changing, and trie com-
plete change takes 19 years. That is, in 1927 the belt will
be in the same position as it is to-day, and the weather
conditions over a large part of the globe should be the
same. This 19-year jobble of the Belt is cauked because
the world wobbles on its axis as it goes round, as a top
often does. This wobble is constant, and takes 19 years
.to make a circuit. Now, this is where Bussell fell in.
The 19-year variation in the moon’s orbit is also caused
by this same jobble ; so what he took for a cause was only
an effect. The only satisfaction Bussell’s memory can
get, therefore, is that he was the first to stumble on the
19-year cycle idea ; but not being born a Judge, he pro-
ceeded to give his reasons, which were all wrong.

The time when the Melbourne naval
people really enjoy themselves is when they are
given a thousand cases or so of condemned explo-
sives and told to go down the Bay and have a
good time. They convey the stuff gleefully in a
launch to the shallows off Laverton Beach at the
back of Williamstown, and drop it carefully into
the sea, until there is a submerged monument of
sudden death on the sea floor with one end of an
electric cable buried in the middle of it. When
all the stuff has been put overside, the launch
steams slowly away, paying out the cable until
the limit has been reached, and then someone
presses the key. There is an enormous thud as
if an earthquake had leaped out of bed, and a
crumbling, cloud-like pillar of water goes scooting
straight up to Heaven. It goes up and up, like
the shaft of a lift or the heartfelt prayer of a pun-
ter ; it looks as if it didn’t intend ever to come down
again, and you begin to wonder who will get the
contract for filling up the hole in the sea. By-and-
bye, though, the ascending column slackens and
turns, and, crumbling like a shower of sand, falls
gracefully and swiftly back into a very muddy
and disturbed mess of waters, on the surface of
which are floating the dead bodies of the fish
which the patient pier angler wastes his life trying
to catch. Williamstown was shaken out of its
dreams one recent day by A crash, as if the maga-
zine of Sheol had gone off. The Oldest
Inhabitant went about telling everyone that
the Bent Government had gone at last, and he
couldn't be persuaded to stop cheering until the
paper arrived with the explanation of the disturb-
ance. The naval people had been at it again.

Per means of XXX the Guinness people
are climbing high up in the British nobility.
Benjamin Lee Guinness, son of the first bottler
of the stout which has made the family fortune,
gave £150,000 to restore St. Patrick’s Cathedral,
Dublin, and was made a baronet. His second
son, Edward Cecil Guinness, was made a baronet
in recognition of his gift of-£250,000 for the re-
building of some Dublin slums. The work occu-
pied six years, and when it was finished Queen
Victoria raised the builder to the Beerage (or
Stoutage) as Baron Iveagh. After the last visit
of the King to Ireland, Iveagh presented £50,000
to local hospitals by way of commemoration, and,
in return he was made a Viscount.
AN OBJECT-LESSON FROM JUDAEA.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Jerusalem elections are proceeding quietly. —S. M.
Herald, 3/12fOS.
Hush ! Do you hear a sound?
No, no, you don’t.
Yet if you look around,
As is the wont
Of him who seeks ttie wonder-things of life,
You’ll note a plethora of silent strife ;
Israel Cohen and his lady wife
Are voting. No loud tabor, drum or fife
Publishes the event;
None cheers or yells.
Jerusalem in pent,
Dark silence dwells.
Observe the Candidate :
No shouts from him —
No wild appeals to Fate
(Arbiter grim)—
No nagging at the Opposition camp—
He raileth not, nor doth he froth or ramp.
Only in gloom or shine, in dry or damp,
lie whispers kindly cheer to those who tramp
Towards the polling booths.
He none reviles ;
Bight gratefully it soothes
To mark his smiles.
The “ Orange and the Green ”
Insanity
Is nowhere to be seen.
These folks would flee
In hushed disgust were Dill to take the stump ;
They have no longings unfulfilled to jump
On Pius, nor to urge on Bome-resump-
Tion. They are types who wouldn’t give a dump
To view the Papacy
Sizzling in oil ;
Eke tipsy would feel no glee
To see it boil.
No loathly drunk is here,
No curses rend
The gracious atmosphere ;
Yiddishers wend
Them pollwards, plump, and calmly turn again
And make for home. An absence of all vain
And senseless uproar—dulling to the brain
And maddening otherwise—extends amain.
’Mid a deep hush and vast
The voting’s done.
’Tis as though some Black Fast
Had just begun.

COLUMN
The Adelaide Steamship Co. has a Christmas
present for its shareholders. Following the Union S. S.
Co., it transfers its insurance fund (£144,000) and part of
its renewal fund to reserves, and with the money pays for
40,574 of its unissued shares. The present paid capital is
£507,175 in 101,435 £5 shares ; so the Christmas box is
equal to two new shares for each five old ones. The £5
shares will, however, be split up into £1 shares ; so the
holder of five old £5 shares will get 35 new £1 shares.
There will still be 39,955 shares unissued :
101,435 old shares = 507,175 new
40,574 bonus shares = 202,870 ~
7,991 old shares = 39,955 unissued
150,000 old = 750,000 new
The co. has had a remarkably prosperous time during
the past few years. For some time down to 1900 it had a
paid capital of £202,890 in £lO shares, which at the begin-
ning of 1899 were quoted at no more than £9l7s. By the
end of the following year the £lO shares had moved up
from £9 17s. to £2O. In 1901 five new £5 shares were
issued for every one old £lO share ; and the new shares
were quoted at £5. So from the beginning of 1899 to the
end of 1901 there had been a market appreciation from
£9 17s. to £25. Up to that time the co. had been of a
semi-private character, and very few people knew that it
had been building up internal reserves. It has been doing
the same thing latterly ; but this time the fact has been
more obvious.

This society is forging ahead rapidly. The one doubt is
whether all the business is being done on sound lines.
The society says that it can do all that it is undertaking
to do ; some other people are not so sure. However,
this is one of the questions which the Commonwealth
Commission on Insurance will presumably inquire into ;
though it is doubtful whether it has enough actuarial
strength about it to do all that a Commission should do.
Statistician Knibbs is, of course, a very fine mathema-
tician, and there are few men in Australia who can knock
up a workable knowledge of any subject more quickly
than he ; but he hasn’t the practical experience.
Probably, the Government will appoint some indepen-
dent consulting actuary, with a practical knowledge of
insurance work, to assist the Commission. If the T. and G.
Society can prove to this body that it is able to do all that
it is undertaking to do, well and good ; it deserves the
very rapid progress it is making. But, if the rapid
progress is due to the offer under certain tables of more
than the society can perform, then, seeing that it is a
mutual society without shareholders’ capital, there must
be sore disappointment by and bye, just as there has
been in so many friendly societies. That is one reason
why the Commission has such important work to do.
No doubt, by taking certain risks, an office may
so improve its position, provided everything goes
the right way, that it may presently be able to
do things which seem almost impossible at the moment.
In this case, for instance, the attractions which the
society offers under certain tables have swollen the
figures so rapidly that the expense rate has been hauled
down pound after pound. These are the figures for 10
years past

A considerable step up is certainly shown for the past
year. But, then, the amount of new business must be
taken into account. Actually the new Ordinary pre-
miums for the past year are nearly 30 per cent, of the
whole premium income. Reckoning renewal premiums
on old businesss to cost 7 p.c. (a very low estimate for an
office of this size), then the new business cost only 77
per cent, to get- a remarkably low average ; one of the
lowest expense rates, in fact, ever achieved in Australia.
But the medical inspection charges were very light, so
some of what the office saves at the spigot it may by and
bye waste at the tap. Also, no doubt, the best of the
Industrial business is passed on to the Ordinary depart-
ment after the former has done its missionary work.
There is nothing to complain of in that. In fact, it is one
of the best functions of the Industrial branch. An in-
surer can’t promote himself out of the Industrial into the
Ordinary branch too soon. The question, however, re-
mains : What remuneration ought the Industrial office to
get for doing this work? On the face of it, it looks as
if it doesn’t get enough. If it did, that new Ordi-
nary business cost might be more than 77 per cent.
The average size of the policy issued by the
Ordinary department last year was £94. With
a business of that intermediate character, a very low
expense rate is practically out of the question, except
insofar as it can be procured by dispensing with medical
examinations and by sucking the Industrial branch of its
most persistent members. Even then it is to be feared
that a very large proportion of lapses must be expected.
Still, a society which caters energetically for this inter-
mediate business is doing a large public service ; if it
bends its energies to that, and drops the short-term In-
dustrial endowment business, it will deserve to be spoken
of very well indeed.
The assets appear to be a good lot; on the
average they returned £4 9s. 7d. per cent, last year—that
is on the mean of the funds. The recent record has been :
1901.. .. £4 10 3 p.c. 1905.. ..£4 10 6 p.c.
1902 .. .. 4 9 4,, 1906 .. .. 4 9 1 „
1903 .. ' 4 8 8 „ 1907 .. .. 4 9 2 „
1904 .. .. 4 9 1 „ 1908 .. .. 4 9 7 „
This record is all the better when it is considered that
42 per cent, of the assets are Government and municipal
securities (it might be just as well, by the way, to dis-
tinguish between these); mortgages represent a very
moderate 26 per cent., and properties (including fore-
percent., which is also moderate, though it
might be less. Still, so far as the disposition of the assets
is concerned, there is no reason at all on the figures to
fling even a pebble at a society whose past few' years have
been marked by a very notable amount of activity.

This co., which pursues business into most of the corners
in which it lurks, and plucks the ripe commission from
pretty well any sort of tree that bears the fruit, has had
a career that the management has a right to be rather
proud of. In the beginning of things it was mostly a
pastoral and pastoral finance co. ; and it arrived in 1884,
which was just the time to accumulate some magnificent
bad debts in that line of business. Yet it pulled through
wonderfully ; not only did it not have to ask its creditors
for any consideration, but it went on paying 8 per cent,
dividends without a break from 1885 to 1901. As the list
above shows, things turned the wrong way then ; but,
judging by the very large figures of the past three or four
years, it looks as though a very conservative policy was
followed during the bad years of the drought, provision
being made for worse things than really happened.
Meantime the co. has been spreading its energies into
new fields—latterly, for instance, into timber; and there
have been some sweet profits in that industry. One re-
sult of this energy in new directions is the appearance of
an item, “Merchandise,” on this year’s balance-sheet for
the first time ; it stands at £169,269. Previously what-
ever stocks were held were included with “advances,
etc. ” : so that course has still been followed in the com-
parison which comes next: —

The figures have been moving up very rapidly. “Sundry
creditors” have in two years gone from £2,214,715 to
£4,173,667. Of the latter £2,842,053 is described as
“Sundry creditors and customers’ balances”; the rest
consists of bills payable, etc. It is very clear that the
turnover has been increasing fast; this no doubt is partly
due to good seasons, but extensions of business (in-
cluding some purchases in S. Aus. and elsewhere) are
also a factor. The risks, of course, go up with the
liabilities and the employment of the money in the
business. At the end of the year the total liabilities
were £6,967,357 : the capital and reserves were £1,340,311.
Thus each £1 of shareholders’own funds has to protect
the investment of £5 4s. of the public’s money. There
are great possibilities in the way of profit; also in a busi-
ness of this sort there are great possibilities in the way of
loss. The most cheerful feature is that, on past records,
this co. makes substantial provision for those highly
probable losses apart from the visible reserves altogether.
In the table at the top of this, £5OOO appropriated for the
staff benevolent fund has been deducted from the past
year’s profits. The fund now totals £15,000.

Twelve months ago it was reported here that, on account
of the bigger prices which kauri was commanding, a re-
valuation was in progress, “ apparently with the object
of writing up the remaining assets, and thus wiping out
some of the deficit.” The re-valuation must have been
a matter of great difficulty, not to say a matter of
guesswork to a large extent; but the result was to wipe
out not only some of the deficit, but the whole of it, and
put a reserve in its place. For many years, down to 1901,
the proceeds from the sale of timber, less working- ex-
penses, were treated as profit; that is to say, when a tree
or a thousand trees were chopped down, the assets were
not regarded as any less than they had been. Then,
owing to a requirement of the Victorian Companies Act,
a change was made, and as the assets were reduced an
Accumulated Assets Depreciation Deficiency Account
was established. This represented the capital (in the
shape of timber) which had been cut down and carted
away. The revaluation wipes that deficiency out; in
other words, the remaining assets are reckoned to
have so appreciated that what are left are set down
as being worth very nearly as much as the
whole lot used to be worth. As a matter of
fact 12 months ago the Assets Deficiency account
totalled £219,920, and the present writing-up is
£227,458, so that the latter outweighs the other ; but,
then, the deficiency account had been written down to
some extent out of profits, so that the £219,920 didn’t
represent quite all the assets that had been chopped
down and carted away. When the new arrangement was
made in 1901 the total value of timber cut off since the
formation of the co. (1888), and consequently not repre-
sented by assets, was set at £264,920 ; and there has been
seven years’ chopping since then. Thus, after all this
extra chopping, the timber still available is estimated to
have increased in value to the extent of £227,458, or only
£37,462 less than the book value of all the timber cut in
the 13 years between 188 S and 1901. Or, put in another
way, the timber in 1907 was set down at £352,510, so that
the £227,458 meant a writing-up of 60 per cent. ; and it is
a great pity that a lump that size should have fallen in
among the assets all at once. Somebody must have known
that these assets were appreciating, and it wasn’t a
proper thing to have allowed the appreciation to go to
that extent before squaring-up the balance-sheet. Even
as late as. November, 1906, the shares in this co. were sold
at 4s. lid. (15s. paid) and 17s. (335. paid). Now, with
most investments rather weaker, these particular shares
are worth 16s. and 345. ; and a movement of that
character doesn’t reflect much credit on the management.
For some years the co. paid no div. at all, and in 1898 it
was found necessary to write off 7s. per share of the
capital. (There are 600,000 shares, 150,000 of them fully
paid to 335. The total written off was thus £210,000.)
The trouble in those days was a heavy swag of debentures,
totalling £275,000 ; but the last of these have lately been
cleared off, partly out of profits, partly by reducing stocks,
which are now very low. What may be called the cash
position has varied as follows :
1901. 1906. 1907. 1908.
Liabilities, includ-
ing debentures.. £327,610 £195,191 £129,387 £58,953
Liquid assets .. 148,342 143,061 177,437 185,242
Deficit .. £179,268 £52,130
Surplus .. £48,050 £126,289
Of the liquid assets £74,085 is in deposits and shares in
other cos. Timber cos. have had a remarkably good time
during the past few years, and attention has two or three
times been drawn to this co.’s striking progress. Further-
more, timber is, over a stretch of years, almost bound to
be good properly in the future. But the profits of the
past few years are not likely to be regularly sustained:
there has been a building boom, and there will be a re-
action. With the debentures out of the way, and a big
wad of investments earning steady money, this co.’s
profits are not likely to be so erratic as they have been
in the past ; nevertheless it seems certain that they will
fluctuate very considerably.

The arrival of the brewery amalgamation has changed the
look of things. In that co.—the Carlton and United
Breweries Proprietary, Ltd. —the Castlemaine Co. was
allotted 12 per cent, of the capital in consideration of
transferring its business connection. The co.’s brewery
is not, however, used by the amalgamation—neither this
co.’s nor McCracken’s. This co. therefore undertook a
revaluation of the unused brewery and other assets.
Various amounts were written off as follows :
Depreciation of brewery £50,314
Depreciation of hotel properties .. .. 30,421
Loss on realising rolling stock .. .. 3,174
Ditto on plant and machinery .. .. 1,495
Total £55,404
Some of this —the second item, for instance—cannot be
regarded as due to the amalgamation. But on the other
side is the value of the interest in the combine, which is
put in this way
C. and U. B. Shares £102,500
Dess paid on account .. .. .. .. 20,500
£82,000
Less realisation depreciation reserve account.. 25,625
£56,375
The practical effect of all this is to write up some
assets by £56,375, and write down other assets by £85,404,
leaving the net amount written off £29,029, as shown in
the table. The amount shown as “ paid on account” of
Carlton and United Breweries shares presumably repre-
sents tangible assets handed over. Of course, the value
set upon the C. and U. B. shares is largely a paper value-
in other words, theitems are mostly goodwill; forthecom-
bine doesn’t even own a brewery. What it uses it leases.
For the first year it paid a dividend of 6 per cent. ; the
Castlemaine Co.’s share was £6150. Other Castlemaine

The div. from the combine (£6150) will pay the debenture
interest (£5000) and leave a trifle over. In the present
. accounts, however, there are only 12 months’ receipts
from the combine, while there is 15 months’interest to
provide for. Rents, interest, etc., brought in £5616;
management, repairs, and sundry exes, totalled £3863.
The rent return is shockingly small—under 5 per cent,
per annum on the written-down value, out of which
repairs have to be paid. The paid capital stands at
£125,000 in £1 shares ; it is proposed, on account of the
revaluation, to write these shares down to 12s. 6d. This
means writing off £46,875, leaving £78,125 of capital. Six
per cent, on that would call for £4687 ; to pay that divi-
dend and also the debenture interest, the net profit must
be £3537 in addition to the 6 per cent, received from the
United Breweries. It is not, however, suggested that
6 per cent, is a good enough return from a brewery in-
vestment at present ; but it is something to go on with.
And if £95,000 worth of hotels can’t provide that much
profit, it is time they were written down some distance
further.

Having in the previous year arrived at reserves totalling
£2711, the society in 1896 got back on to the dividend
list, paying a modest 2 per cent. ; and it went on being-
modest while it steadily strengthened the reserves.
Hitherto the amounts showm above as written off have
mostly reduced the special reserve provided to meet
possible losses on uncompleted contracts ; but this year
. the directors appropriate £4478 towards writing down the
freehold premises to £4o,ooo—the figure at which they
were revalued at the cleaning-up in 1894 ; so that the
amount now' written off represents the improvements
made since then. As the following shows, there has been
a steady growth of business :

These are the balance-sheet figures, before the annual
appropriations. An excellent feature is the clearing out
of foreclosed properties. On the other hand, liabilities
have largely increased—from £74,334 to £196,622 in eight
vears, without any increase of capital. The shareholders’
risk, of course, depends upon the care which the manage-
menthas exercised with regard to the advances into which
this and other money has been put ; and that is not a
thing that can be gauged by the published figures
until we have had the bump as well as the boom. One
favorable thing is that good additions have been made to
reserves, so that even now', in spite of the large increase
of deposils, the total liabilities amount to only £1 17s.
for every £1 of capital and reserves combined.

This society used to have 27,558 shares of £5 each ; but
when the trouble came and brought calls with them,
4643 were forfeited, leaving 22,915 (£114,575) on October
31, 1903. In the ensuing year there was an overhaul
of securities and a consequent severe writing-down of
capital ; so the next balance-sheet showed 45,460 shares
of £1 each. Two £1 shares had been issued in place of
each £5 share that remained alive. The society’s chief
trouble for many years consisted of debentures, mostly
held in Glasgow. In 1894, after the debenture-holders
had refused a voluntary arrangement, the Court was
appealed to, and sanctioned a scheme of repayment. At
that time the total debt on this account was £73,398, and
there were also £103,263 of deposits, mortgages, and other
liabilities. The shifting of this heavy load has been a
long and wear}' process ; but through the sale of assets
at written-down values, things have been gradually
straightened-up, and at the present time the debenture
debt is £24,742 and other debts £26,115. On account of
the writing-down in 1903-4, it isn’t much use going
back beyond that time, except to look at the reduction of
debt (unfortunately no plan has yet been discovered for
writing down debt) ; but since 1903-4 this progress has
been made: —

The property has been sold niostly on time-payment;
and that accounts for the increase in advances, etc. For
some years, whatever profit was made on these sales was
turned into an internal reserve to protect the valuations
of the remaining assets or to provide for new bad debts ;
but in 1907 it was announced that, as the sales had shown
an average of 7£ per cent, over book-values, the profit
would be then added to the reserve fund. Hence the
profit on sales shown during, the past two years. The
capital, as shown above, is now £48,364 ; to be added to
that is £2558 in investing shares. On the {permanent
shares the year’s net business profit (£2188) is equal to
just over 4£ per cent. No dividend can, however, be paid
until the debentures have all been wiped out; and they
are not payable till 1911. Still, the profit is accumulating,
and will make the maintenance of dividends easier when
they do start again.

Things at Broken Hill have taken a bad turn.
The B. H. Prop., which employs, as a rule, nearly as many
men as all the other cos. put together, and more than all
the others if its outside works are counted in, has an-
nounced that it must be either a wage-reduction or
a shut-down. True, Chairman Darling said, : the
other day, that there wasn’t going to be a cut
in wages; but that turns out to have been mere
play with words. The B. H. Prop, says that the 12J per
cent, rise granted two years ago wasn’t wages—it'was a
bonus. Now it wants the so-called bonus knocked off.
Meantime the other cos., except the B. H. Prop.’s
southern neighbor, Block 10, have met the men
and renewed the old agreement for two years. It
is pretty certain that there couldn’t be two rates
of pay for the one field; if the B. H. Prop,
paid a shilling a day less than the others, then the others
would get the pick of the men and the B. H. Prop, would
get the culls. Knowing that, Broken Hill forms the
opinion that the B. H. Prop, really prefers to shut up
shop—just, in fact, as Block 14 and the British have done
during the past year—and wait for a better lead market.
It may, however, carry on its smelting works, relying on
ore-purchases from other mines to keep its staff going
on reduced rations. If it doesn’t, two or three of the
other mines will be in a bad way, because they depend
on the B. H. Prop, to take their output.
Of course the men will go to the Federal Arbi-
tration Court. On the surface, it looks as
though they have a strong leg-in there ; for they will be
able to show that all the other mines bar the B. H. Prop,
and Block 10 have agreed to “no reduction.” It isn’t,
however, so good an argument as it looks, because three
of the mines that have agreed to the current rates of pay
have been shut down for 12 months past and are still shut
down because they can’t run their mills at a profit. Nor
have they given any undertaking now that they will
re-open them. All along they have employed a few men,
doing a bit of development work ; and their present in-
tention appears to be to merely keep on at that. Even
the South, which has improved as rapidly as the B. H.
Prop, has depreciated, has been running most of the year
on a reduced scale ; and the Sulphide Corporation has
grabbed the chance to shut down for a fortnight or more
at Christmas.
For four years The Bulletin has been saying,
again and again, that the great B. 11. Prop, was getting
to the end of its tether; but the public has con-
tinued to give outrageous prices for the shares. The
big ore shoot is fast dipping out of the property,
and the bottom levels are almost bare of ore. There is
no more than five or six years’ supply proved in the mine,
and what there is of it is of generally poor quality. To deal
with it the co.’s mills badly need overhauling and
remodelling ; and this no doubt will be done. Under
those circumstances, the B. H. Prop, has been culti-
vating an ore-buying business ; and it would suit the
cunning co. splendidly for other cos. to supply
its smelting' and refining works with ore while
the markets are low, so that it might save
up what little of its own ore it has left until the
lead and silver markets improve. In any case, even
assuming that the Arbitration Court decides in favor of
the rates of pay agreed upon by the other cos., big
changes will come in the B. H. Prop. Sixteen years ago,
when the rich oxidised ore was just about exhausted, that
unpleasant fact was smothered up under a labor trouble;
now the approaching exhaustion of the sulphides is likely
to be smothered up in the same way. But, unfortunately,
this isn’t a crisis that can be really met by a wage-reduc-
tion ; for no wage-cut will put ore into an almost worked-
out mine, and that is what the B. 11. Prop.’s trouble
amounts to.
* * * *
It doesn’t seem as though Block 14, Broken
Hill, will re-start its mill early next year, as was at one
time thought. A diamond-drill bore has been put down
obliquely across the ore channel from 400 ft. to a depth
of about 1300 ft., and no ore body has been located.
Another bore will be put down from the 500 ft. level.
If neither of these strikes ore, then the shareholders
may settle down to extract what comfort they can from
the surface pockets of carbonates. In the upper levels the
mine has about 200,000 tons or so of sulphides left; but
that is a mere handful for a mill. Except for its
bunches of carbonates, this mine’s position is the same
as the B. H. Prop.’s, only worse, inasmuch as its sul-
phide reserves are much smaller.

In the calculation of working costs in.concen-
trating mills and workshops, every small item should be
taken into consideration. It is the small and uncon-
sidered factors, involving waste of power, that make for
high working costs. The type of bearing employed has a
marked effect on the power consumed in overcoming
friction. Recent exhaustive tests emphasised the marked
superiority of the Hyatt Flexible Roller Bearings over all
other types of roller, sleeve, and other anti-friction
bearings. Under equal conditions the loss of power due
to friction in Hyatt Flexibles is 23 per cent, less than
with the best solid roller bearing, and 65 per cent, less
that with babbit metal journals. Messrs. VV. and J.
Lempriere, 506 Little Collins Street, Melbourne, will be

South Blocks, Broken Hill, did very good work
during: November. Here is a comparison of three
months’ results: —
Sept. Oct. Nov.
Ore milled, tons .. . - 8,580 9,165 • 9.-33
Lead in concentrates, tons.. 1,116 1,158 l»*lo
Silver „ „ oz. .. 15,368 16,192 16,659
Total costs per ton .. .. 13/10 13/4 13/5
Ore extraction cost 6s. 10d., ore treatment ss. 6d., and
general expenses Is. Id. On to that, however, has to be
added the amount charged up to capital account, which
works out at 2s. 4d. per ton. This includes the money
spent on plant. Compared with 12 months ago, the
figures relating to ore values and costs show very little
change. Working costs in November, 1907, were 13s. Oil.
per ton ; but in that month 6s. 3d. additional was charged
up to capital account to cover development and construc-
tion. Also the quantity of ore handled has moved up from
8004 tons to 9233 tons, which is a large factor when
aggregate profits come to be reckoned up. At present
those profits can’t be calculated ; for, presuming the old
arrangement continues, values are not adjusted until the
third month after the shipment has been made. There
is practically no change in the quality of the ore which
is being developed in the new bottom level. The south
drive shows an ore body B£ft. wide, worth 15‘4 per cent,
lead and 3oz. silver ; in the north drive the body is 9stt.
wide, and worth 16'2 per cent- lead and 3'3oz. silver—a
shade poorer in lead, and a shade richer in silver than the
ore so far dug out of the next level above.
* * * *
Junction North, Broken Hill, will most likely
come along with a div. in January—the first since 1897.
The money is available ; the only question is whether the
manager won’t want to put it into machinery. There
has been a long jump in the market for this stock ;
Palmers, its principal broker-barrackers, circularised
clients advising purchase, and that no doubt accounted
for the move. The mine is at last well equipped and
developed, and, in spite of the hardness of the ore, it can
work at low cost. The uncertainty lies outside the mine
—in the metal markets.
* * * *
Some wonderful mining information gets into
the papers. The other day a morning paper announced
that the Sulphide Corporation (N.S.W.) was paying 10
per cent, on ordinary shares ; an evening paper set out
to put things right, and announced that the dividend
was 1 per cent, on the pref. shares. The fact, of
course, was that 10 per cent, is payable on pref. shares.
Ordinaries have had nothing since 1900 ; they got 15
per cent, that year. Originally there were 1,100,000 PI
shares; 550,000 ordinaries were paid for the patent
rights of the Ashcroft process, etc. The Ashcroft pro-
cess was a failure ; but instead of wiping out the
550,000 shares, ss. in the £1 was written off them.
As it was utterly insufficient, the directors have since
been doing the next-best thing—writing assets down
heavily out of profits; in other words, making profits
provide the capital outlay. It is mighty rough on the
people who have bought the ordinary shares; but it
lias.saved the co. from bankruptcy.
* * * *
General manager Thomas Pascoe, for four years
in charge of the Mount Boppy, N. S. Wales’ most con-
sistent gold-producer, left for London by the Geelong last
week, the co. having recalled him and sent out another
Oornishman, Negus. In Pascoe’s four years Mount Boppy
has done some remarkable work. It has put through
about 266,150 tons of stone for 167,9260 z. gold bullion,
worth £514,398, and the dividends (including this year’s
distribution) reach 190 per cent, on the capital. As there
are 121,000 shares, a trifle over a quarter of a million has
been paid, which is more than half of the value of the
gold won. In the shape of a N.S.W. gold mine J. Bull
never before got hold of anything half so profitable. Now
also he is having a dig at the South Boppy, which, on Mr.
Pascoe’s recommendation, wasfloatedoff into a prospecting
co. last year. So far the co. has found one good block of
ground, but it was too small for J. Bull’s large appetite,
and something better is now being sought. The chances
are hopeful : for if the Boppy reef lasts the South must
get it, and there is also a parallel reef which may
be worth working. Something of the same sort ought to
be done with what is locally known as the Northern Ex-
tension—Hogan’s Block, the Canbelego King, the Birth-
day, etc.—but conflicting interests have so far stood in the
way.
J ‘ * *
Lobb’s Hole (N.S.W.) expects to get its little
furnace at work by the end of the month. The mine is
proving to be just what it was represented—a small,
rich, and rather irregular vein in hard country. It will
pay well ; but when the capital was fixed the estimates
were based on a copper market of over £BO, and that’s
the only visible fly in the ointment.
The crank shaft snapped and put Great
Boulder’s main winder out of action the other day.
Another is being made in the East, and, pending its arri-
val, an improvised arrangement for getting mill supplies
via other shafts has been fixed up. This, however, only
permits of the plant running at barely three-quarter
capacity, and consequently about 100 men have had to
take a spell. The middle of January should see opera-
tions in full swing again. *
Lake View (W.A.) has got something in
winzing at 250 ft. west below 1900 ft. Already, locally, it
is reckoned that the find is “ the nucleus of a big lens of
ore as rich as the one which made the mine famous in
days gone by,” but as only a few feet of sinking has been
done, it is a bit too early to whoop in this way.
Burbanks Main Lode (W.A.) crushed 16,870
tons, and recovered £34,000, for the year ended June 30.
This is respectively 4173 tons and £5OOO better than the
previous year’s figures ; but heavy capital expenditure
has swallowed a lot of the surplus. Still the co. is in a
position to repeat last year’s distribution of 10 per cent.
Victory United, the mostly-Adelaide co. which
has been living on hope, and getting very thin on the
diet, has taken an option on Reidy’s mine, near Stake-
well, in the Murchison district (W.A.). Nothing seems to
be known about this show except that “ two large lodes
have been worked” and are “reported to have yielded
satisfactory trial crushings,” which is all very vague.
The average value of the output from the
Mararoa (W.A.) is to be gradually reduced until the 48s.
to 465. mark is reached.

British Exploration of Australia, Ltd., has at
last been brought up sharply by the Westralian Govern-
ment. For years past this artful dodger of labor con-
ditions has hung on to some Pilbarra properties without
working them, but recently it received a warning to get
work or get out. Not liking the tone in which the warn-
ing was given, shareholders were hurriedly called to-
gether in London, when, as the finding of further working
capital had become imperative, it was decided to issue
50,000 preference £1 shares. Directors took credit for
having done their best to hold the leases, but this isn’t
much to blow about, or much of an advt. for the Govern-
ment which has allowed the shepherding to be carried on.
Queen Margaret leases at Belong (W. A. ) are
be auctioned. This property was worked on and on i
hand-to-mouth fashion by a Melbourne co. for a d
years or so, and during that time it produced a
£200,000. Very little of this sum found its way I nto
shareholders’ pockets, and a good bit of what did hn
way there had to be pulled out again to pay calls,
the co. is devoting its capital and attention to anotnie
show which it has worked for some years on an adjoining
fieid. # *
Rising Sun and other leases at Desdemona
(W.A.) have been snapped up at £l9OO by Lionel Robin-
son and others for flotation in London.
Over 91 per cent, of the new shares in Gwalia
Consolidated (W.A.) were taken by shareholders, thus
leaving less than 9 per cent, for the guarantors.
* * * *
Lady Miller, at Norseman (W.A.), has just
been sampled bv A. E. Thomas. Its flotation in London
is to follow, though London may quite likely ask for some
confirmatory reports. The mine has been a failure to
date, and any report to the effect that the ore only in-
quires a different process to secure success wants plenty
of confirmation. #
That far-away Roebourne (W.A.) copper and
gold proposition into which mining-man Pettigrew led a
group of Sydney business-men doesn’t improve with age.
When the locai management started to look about for
other properties The Bulletin reckoned that something
was wrong ; still, tales of tremendous possibilities con-
tinue to drift across, though even they weren’t brilliant
enough to keep some holders from crying a go and forfeit-
ing their shares. Lately, a careful young gold-copper
man, John Tilley, was sent over to size up the situation ,
and, though he” isn’t back yet.it is understood he has
wired that the co. doesn’t own one show worth spending
more money on.

pened consequent on the recent Mount Morgan cave-in .
750 ft. and 850 ft. levels deserted ; two shiploads of coal
suspended ; coke supply stopped ; from the Iron Island
(flux) trade one vessel withdrawn, also 50men idle there ;
Marmor limestone quarry work suspended, and 126 men
idle • 73 men idle at the copper works ; woodcutters at
Stanwell and Woodend (18 miles from the mine) are job-
less, for the brigalow supply has been stopped. Judging
by the miners’ emphatic objections to the brigalow for
timbering, this traffic will have little chance of a resur-
rection.

Mt. Elliott, Cloncurry (Q.), will give trouble to
a lot of people during 1909. Those who haven’t had too
much confidence in Cloncurry expected serious things to
happen before this, but the market has kept wonderfully
firm, considering the price of copper. Some unpleasant
truths will, however, have to be told soon. Even now
the management isn’t quite able to persuade itself that
what it has got in the bottom level is the lode ; in fact,
it has persistently refused to call it the lode, it is so little
like what was expected. If it can’t find anything better
it will have to admit, not only that the level is a failure,
but that the whole smelting plans will have to be altered.
From a Northern mining man who has been
viewing the situation: “The Mt. Elliott folk are still
looking for that big body of sulphides; and should they
stick to their orginal intention of deferring smelting
operations until this is developed, we may have to w'ait a
long while for returns. Meantime a lot of expensive
plant will be idle. Even if smelting is started with the
ore on hand, the converter will be of no use until sufficient
sulphur is available for matte production. About five
years’ supply of ore is said to be in sight, but the pro-
cess of smeiting to black copper, which must neces-
sarily be adopted, is full of difficulties, even to the
most experienced. The plant should be capable of
turning out about 16 tons of copper daily. Whether
it will do so or not depends upon several things, of
which the water supply is chief. It appears pretty
certain that the meagre supply of this essential will be
a constant source of trouble, in spite of large expendi-
ture in a system of vaporisers and surface-condensers,
the value of the latter having yet to be proved in the
Cloncurry district.”
A remarkable position has developed in the
affairs of the Gibb Copper Mines (Q.), At a meeting of
shareholders, some two months ago, a resolution was
adopted in favor of winding up, and that wasn’t done any
too soon. In the face of this decision, the Board did
absolutely nothing to give effect to it, and now has so
far oone the other way as to call for tenders for working
the property on tribute. Whether the directors are
serious in their intention to proceed with the tribute or
are simply sparring for time is not apparent. The
latter is' very likely, in view' of the reported
trouble between the co. and Allan Gibb, who gave the co.
an option over certain of the leases. The w'hole affair is
full of complications as regards the ownership of the
leases. Naturally there is an outcry among shareholders
at the action of the directors in making a further call to
satisfy liabilities, when the general meeting directed
that these were to be met by realisation of the
assets ; and there will undoubtedly be some difficulty
in collecting the call. It is questionable, anyhow,
whether the tributes can be let on terms sufficiently good
to make it worth while. The experience of the late
management in the matter of costs was rather discourag-
ing, and there does not appear to be much room for
profit for both the co. and tributors. The mine, such
as it is, has several small lodes, well developed, but the
authorities are not at all likely to allow' this ore to be
rooted out without some compensating development work
being carried on. It is probable that the shareholders’
decision will eventually be enforced.
Reconstructions are becoming frequent at Char-
ters Towers, and in some cases some of the old paid-up
shareholders will be left with calls to pay. Clark’s
Brilliant Worcester and Victory, which struck its colors
lately, is now' known as Clark’s Brilliant and Day Dawn.
Clark’s (for short) crushed 171 tons for £637, which
will help things along. The shaft is 812 ft. deep,
and is being sunk in search of the Day Dawn reef.
The old Victory, near by, has an interested eye on the
w'ork, and may start to sink on its own account one of
these days. The Victory has been getting good returns
from narrow leaders and should have a fair amount of
cash in the till. But prospecting is expensive. Brilliant
St. George, for instance, w'ent to the bad a few thousands
last half-year. This co. has also started to sink for the
Day Dawn reef, making the fourth shaft w'ith that
objective (Freeholds, B. Block, Clark’s and B. St. George).
New Brilliant Freehold, Charters Towers, looks
better in the deepest level (No. 8), which, at 261 ft. out,
has a reef 6ft. wide in the end. This helps to sustain the
market, which is, as usual, limp just before Christmas ;
and the local market has also been disturbed by the
troubles of one or two heavy plungers. The 600 ft. of
driving in No. 7 is taken as a basis to calculate ore
reserves ; but with two blanks in No. 7, a long run of
poor ground in No. 8, and very little proved near the
Mexican’s boundary, there is really not enough to go
on in calculating either quantity or quality. On
the assumption that the reef has a length of
600 ft., with 250 ft. of backs, the reserves are officially
estimated at 45,208 tons. The hanging-wall reef is erratic,
judging by the difference in value of the stone obtained
in No. 7 and No. 6 and the split reef at the end. The
hanging-wall reef is taking a slight trend to the north ;
and? as it is estimated that there is 1000 ft. of untried
ground ahead, it will be good news to hear of No. 6
making into a strong body again, No. 7on the main reef
has about 550 ft. to go to reach the Brilliant Blocks.
Brilliant Extended, Charters Towers, has placed
£2OOO on fixed deposit, which is sound finance for a mine
estimated to only have one and a half years supply
of stone in sight (60,000 tons). A sixpenn 3 ' dividend ab-
sorbs £6562. Costs have been reduced to £1 14s, 4d and
the half-year’s gross profit (£20,563 from 27,620 tons)
averages about 18s. per ton.
Peter and Paul, Gympie (Q.j, has struck the
favorable black slates at 3uoft. The co. will now open out
to the west. The Homeward Bound and Hibernian, " hich
lies in that direction, the other day reported getting 50oz.
gold in specimens from the Hibernian reef, and gold is
still showing. The reef averages 2ft. quartz. The co. s
other reef (Pringle's) also carries nice gold, but is a
smaller body. The Bulletin’s predictions of October
last respecting this property have thus been proved cor-
rect, and the locality continues its promise of removing
some of the cloud which hangs over Gympie.^
Chillagoe (N.Q.) now depends mainly on the
railway revenue, which has doubled since 1905. lor the
year to March 31, 1908, the total was £114,840 ; expenses
absorbed £36,847, leaving £77,993 to pay interest, etc.
This was the line’s best year by a long chalk. The current
financial year will show a decrease. For the first eight
months the revenue was £77,993, as compared with
£79,275 last year; and things are not improving up
north. Had not the construction of the Etheridge railway
stimulated traffic, the returns would have shown a much
bigger slump. Helped hy the extension of the railway
line, Ohillagoe smelter returns are improving ; the yield
for November was 206 tons copper, 779 tons lead, and
67,6940 z. silver, worth about £30,000. But Chillagoe and
Mungana have between them 1,500,000 shares, so the
whole gross £30,000 (which includes purchased ore) is
only equivalent to 6d. per share.' 1
Gilmore’s tin mine (N.Q.) has crushed 137 tons
for £B4l worth of concentrates. The mine continues
patchy, with none of the richness of the shallow ground
left. Dalziell’s was sold for £lO ; the owners have made
fair wages out of what once looked like a big mine, but
did not go down—a habit both tin and copper mines have
in North Queensland.

Another Victorian alluvial giant has fallen by
the way. This is the ill-fated Spring Hill and Central
Beads, Allendale. Lying next to the Berry Extended, it
should, if position was anything, have made as good a
dividend showing as the claims higher up the lead. But
the workings got into the “ hydro-thermal,” otherwise a
lacustrine deposit formed by pre-historic forces that blew
as big a hole in the Berry lead as later-day movements
have blown out of George Reid's political ambitions.
Spring Hill Leads would have been jacketed long ago,.but
every now and again on the high ground a rib of
wash was reached. This invariably carried rich gold, and
as invariably led to a share boom. The last flutter
was when Fisher was in charge, and scrip jigged to
nearly 60s. The co. has spent nearly a quarter of a
million, of which £117,000 came from calls ; it has been
at work since 1881, and has never returned a cent to
the investor. The present debt is £3OOO, but share-
holders don’t like to face further risk, so the chance of
more work being done is dubious. Worst of all, lau
men will be thrown on to the market should the mine
close down.
From Chiltern (Vic.) comes the tale of a mining
dispute which a Wages Board would have prevented. One
lot of panellers at the Ohiltern Valley earned 10s. per
shift ; another party not far away only got about 6s. 6d.
So the miners wanted the manager to make up the short-
age to a 7s. 6d. minimum wage. As he couldn t, or
wouldn’t, the Melbourne directors, representing share-
holders who have put only £15,000 into the mine and
drawn out £250,000, were asked to consent. “ A jawing
match that lasted hours” was all the consolation the
anxious faces at Rutherglen got when the deputation
returned to tell of its mission. Maybe a streak of senti-
ment will sway the directors to make up the shortage.
But that isn’t the point. Men are not allowed to loaf
in any mine under John Cock : so, as they have t
work hard, they should get more than 6s. 6d. a shift.
Surface labor receives more than that. It w ' >t )? aU w
inequalities like this in Victorian mining that the Wage
Board system is coming to be recognised all round as a
pressing necessity. , * *
Chairman Gilchrist, of the Melbourne Stock
Exchange, will have to learn to think first and speak
second. He dropped a lb. of lead on the Great Southern
Consols’ toe, which has its abode in Alec p eacock s
office. This was done because it seemed to be thought
that the Consols’yield was a bit slow in appearing.
Peacock is “down” just now, and it would not help
him up to be charged with keeping hack news.
Whatever faults may beset Peacock, however, the
hiding of news isn’t one. When the facts were ac-
cordingly laid out in their nakedness, Gilchrist cooed
out his ‘regret, with an expression that everything was
iust as it should be. Though a mistake was made in this
case, the incident promises well; for one may hope now
that’the Stock Exchange intends to keep a sharp eye on
mining-weary Willies in the interests of investors. Some
mysterious share rises and falls within the past two
months have not drawn forth a murmur of complaint. It
“ Gillv’s” arrow went to the wrong mark this time, he
will find he can hit a bull’s-eye if he turns his optic on to
certain other cos., not far from the Broken Hill group,
whose joggling share values demand notice. *
The S Aus. Government tells the House that
it is morally bound to buy the Shedden coal property, on
the Maitland (N.S. W.) field, the seams having come up to
the owner’s representations. The Government, more-
over, insists that it has made a good bargain—that it will
save £30,000 a year by the deal. That, of course, depends
upon the output that can be maintained. The Bulletin,
in first suggesting that there was room for inquiry as to
whether the best possible bargain was being made,
offered two objections: (1) It is too deep a mine, con-
sidering its great distance from seaboard ; (2) the coal
will probably be found too “ tender ” for the general pur-
poses required, and for the large amount of handling
which it will have to undergo. However, if the State is
committed to the purchase, it is wasting time to sav any-
thing further ; and, anyhow, though the State might
have done better, this bargain will most likely turn out
better than no bargain at all.

The Tongkah Harbor Tin-Dredging Co., into
which Capt. “Teddy” Miles put his Tasmanian friends
hasn’t so far come a quarter-way up to expectations, but
the shareholders are still feeding on glowing estimates.
The co’s property consists of dredging rights to a harbor
bottom in Siam, secured by the IXL Prospecting Co., and
passed on to the Tasmanian co. for *lOO,OOO m paid
shares. There are 50,000 other shares, 13,250 of them
unissued: the others are paid up to various amounts.
In all, £33,517 of capital had been raised to the end of
September, and this had been helped along by £8547
worth of tin on which a gross profit of £l4BO was made.
Of that £650 has been written off for depreciation.
There appears to be no doubt at all that there is a very
large quantity of tin in the harbor bottom ; but whether
and to what extent clay is going to interfere with the
recovery remains to be seen. There admittedly is a lot
of clay in the bottom. Still, '2lb. to the yard (and that
estimate is being borne out) will allow of heavy losses and
still "ive a profit with anything like a fair market. A
couple of other dredges are being rushed on, and these
will help to carry the management expenses, which so far
have been a very severe item.

H M. : Financially, it is in a moderately good
position; but its bonuses don’t come near those of the
other two. The office mentioned in the p.s. is one of the
best Souths: Impossible. No two mines show the
same costs.... A.F. :No;it is an Australian-registered
branch of an English co.
* * *
Even as to the Oaks, the most recent of
Australian rushes, there is already a dispute over the
discovery of it. The Bulletin the other day said it was
Hawkins’ find. Now another correspondent writes to
say it was Charlie Mack’s, and that Mack took Hawkins
in as mate.

Billy T. : One hot afternoon two men
met on the track from a small Gippsland town-
ship to the hills, where recently-discovered coal
seams were being- prospected. When Ball came
up to Cassin, the latter was sitting with his back
to a gum butt, casually polishing a rifle barrel.
Ball threw-his swag to the ground, and the men
exchanged greetings. “A frightful day,” said
Ball, throwing the perspiration from his brow.
Oh, I’ve seen hundreds worse,” answered
Cassin cheerfully. “Well, I don’t want to see
any more of ’em,” said Ball. “ Humpin’ a
lump of a swag about in this heat is simply
perdition. By the holy, if there was water
enough about for a man to drown in it
would be a temptation to go under and
be done.” “ Buck up, mate,” said the
man with the gun. “ This is only a rotten mood.
It will pass. Take it from me, this world ain’t
such a bad place, but what you fellows do is let
the happy moments slide, and brood over the bad
spells. Why don’t you get down in a cool place,
and take it easy, as I do, when the sun’s got you
beat, instead of plugging on, and getting sick of
life? See here, mate, when you see trouble
coming at you, don’t stand square on and take it
—duck and dodge.” Ball went on his way feeling
better for the excellent advice, and left Cassin
gaily polishing his rifle barrel. Next day news
came up to the mine that a man had been found
sitting against a tree on the track with his brains
blown out. It was Cassin. Ball had merely
interrupted his preparations.

“Agricola”: Periodically discussion is
aroused concerning hydatids in rabbits. At the
latest report, several medical men profess them-
selves unconvinced that the rabbit is infested
with hydatids at all, and, even if he is, they hold
that the disease is not communicable to human
beings. The latter part of the statement may
possibly be true, and in any case cooking should
destroy the hydatids. A boiled hydatid ought to
be harmless. But certain it is that a large per-
centage of our daily rabbit is affected with disease
of one kind and another. A bag or cyst, contain-
ing a watery fluid and a mass resembling sago, is
found in various portions of the rabbit’s constitu-
tion. About the commonest place is just under
the skin, in the flanks. It is reported that rab-
biters make these diseased rabbits pass for human
consumption by piercing the cyst with a knife, and
allowing the watery contents to escape. This is
most likely true, but it is a mighty unwholesome
truth. My humble testimony is that no animal
existing is more subject to disease than the
rabbit. Yesterday I watched a trapper preparing
47 of bunny for the market. Eight suffered from
hydatids; the livers of three were a mass of
corruption ; the lungs of one were badly affected,
and seven were infested with large, intestinal
worms. This wholesale unhealthiness on the part
of our friend the rabbit explains the unwillingness
of the Outbacker to use him as an article of diet
when other meat is available. Boiling may be a
safeguard against some things ; but though I
never boiled, a consumptive patient in order to
study the results, I am almost prepared to swear
that all the cookery on earth isn’t a reliable safe-
guard in the case of the rabbit with diseased
lungs.

“ Quan Yarfabah (N.Q.) Anglican
Mission is showing what Binghi ! is capable' of
when he’s kept away from beer and other tliihgs.
Except for the color of its 350 black citizens—
there are only a few whites, who manage the
Mission—and the absence, of a pub, Yarrabah
differs little from the ordinary Australian town-
ship; in fact, it has a couple of adjuncts of
civilisation —gas and the telephone-—which many
townships of similar size don’t own. It has its
own court, local authority, inspector of nuisances,
and military corps. Public meetings are
held once a month to frame or alter rules
and regulations for the management of
the place. Many of the inhabitants are en-
gaged in poultry-breeding, hog-elevating, and
goat-farming, and specially pride themselves
upon their chooks, which won several prizes at the
last Cairns show. Others catch fish and take them
to Cairns for sale. The piccaninnies are given a
decent primary English education. Four grown-
ups print the Aboriginal News, and a dozen or
so make more or less melodious sounds on cornets
and drums and such things. The other day about
40 of them gave an entertainment at Cairns. The
programme consisted of band Selections, solos,
choruses, gymnastic displays; club-swinging, re-
citations, piccaninnies’ songs, and. Samoan dances.
A NEW YEAR’S RESOLUTION.
FEMALE PHILANTHROPIST: “ Aren’t you ashamed of yourself, spending all your money on whisky V’
HOPLESS TIM: "Thatsh right! lam ashamed (hie). After thish I’m goin ’ to save some for
beer—'pon me word, I’m!”
“Snell”: I used to know him in Gipps-
land some years ago, and met him in Swanston-
street, Melbourne, a short time back. He was
carrying a portmanteau, and looked lost. On
closer examination I noticed a sort of fuzzy-wuzzy
expression on his face and a glaze in his eye, and
regretted my spontaneous outburst of friendship.
“Hello!” he said, “’s that you, Bill?” My
name is not Bill, but explanations were useless.
“ S’pose a f’l’r ’ll have a devil’s own job to get a
bed in Melbourne.” I assured him he could get a
thousand beds if he wanted them. “ What
brings you to town just now?” I asked.
“ Why, the Cup, of course,” said he. “What
d’ yeh think? What ud a f’l’rcome to Mel-
bourne for in October?” I explained very
gently that we were now far on in November,
and that the Melbourne Cup of ’OB was laid
with Queen Anne’s bones in a place of rest.
He asked for the explanation several times,
and then he consulted his watch in a dazed
sort of way. “ What is the date ? ” he moaned.
It was the 14th of November. “Fourteenth
of November,” he muttered. “Fourteenth of
November. What a time I must have had in
Bairnsdale ! What a devil of a time I must
have had in Bairnsdale !” He went away,
but turned back after going 20 yards, placed
a trembling hand on my arm, peered into my
face with his boiled codfish eyes, and faltered:
“ You didn’t tell me the year, Bill.” The
year proved all right, and he was relieved.
For a dreadful moment he had imagined that
he might have rioted for 54 weeks in Bairns-
dale, and yet how anyone could get up a jag
in quiet, respectable Bairnsdale by the Mitchell
River I know not.
Once more the luck of the drunk ! Two
or three mates gave Meekatharra, a way-out
Westralian townlet, a coat of red paint a while
■ ago. Meekatharra can put up with a lot, but
things got too warm, and the ‘‘hard cases” were
told to clear out or come inside. They cleared
out, with nothing much left but their boots and
an old pick ; but they hadn’t been gone long be-
fore they raised a spring-dray from somewhere
and returned with nearly 500 oz. of dollied gold.
They had fallen straight away on to a leader which
looks as if it had a good 2000 oz. in sight.

The “ Page for Women,” which the S. M.
Herald provides on Wednesdays by way of a
mid-week break in the dull monotony of J. Cook
and Yassberra, gives an account from London of
a “ Country and Colonial Training School for
Ladies.” • Like this: —
They do every part of the work necessary on a farm,
including housework in all its branches, plain cooking
and bread-making, riding, driving and stable manage-
ment; they learn simple carpentering and the choice of
various woods; they are taught to make jam, bottle
fruit, preserve vegetables, cure bacon and can meat.
Cream is skimmed, and butter made by them in the
simple farmhouse method ; bee culture and tree pruning
are prominent subjects in the course ; and a good general
knowledge of the methods of improving soil is also
taught ; while the girls are taught how to light a bush
fire.
That is the last straw. After learning how to be
a carpenter, groom and' meat-packer, she must
finally have lessons in the noble art of lighting
bush fires, so that, presumably, she may be able
to serve out the cat on the next farm. Yet, with
all her accomplishments, they are forgetting to
teach this perfect farmer’s wife how to milk !
Be opium smuggling. Judging by the
methods of concealing the drug used by those
Chinamen whom the Customs men have bowled
out at the game, the Chow smuggler, like the
Chow gardener, isn’t really the expert some think
he is, but a poor bungler at the game: The
hiding of the drug in a case of fruit marks about
the usual high-water mark of his originality. But
there are exceptions. A wandering photographer
passing through Geraldton (Q.) came across a
Chinaman who showed a comparatively brilliant
mind. Approaching the artist, he opened fire
thusly : “ You savee lil’ box, you buy him makee
photograph ? Paper long box he say ‘ Open long
dark all a time.’ All li. Me givee you letta long
Blisbane, my countlyman he catchee opium, he
put im longa box. Cus’oms he read ’im paper he
say ‘ All li ’ —no catchee. Me pay you six pong.”

THE STORY OF 'BIDGEE QUEEN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
What is the brand on her? “ 1.X.L.”. . .
Well, yes ; I admit it is hard to tell;
For it’s all blotched up
Since the Sheoak Cup,
When she an’The Wombat an’ Lignum tell.
Twas the mare an’ The Wombat that oame down there,
An Lignum blundered over the pair—
The latter moke
Got his backbone broke,
While a gash in the shoulder was my nag’s share 1
She got the fall when a two-year-old—
Ah ! man, she was-worth her weight in gold
In those days to me, was the gallant bay,
An’ I’d backed her to Win me a pot that day 1
But why do you open so wide j'our eyes?
And why do you show such great surprise ?
This tale is true
That I’m telling you ;
(A man would think I was telling lies I)
Though she carries my swag,
An’ my tucker-bag,
She once carried colors—did that there nay !
This is the old mare’s story : Out
Past Hay, in the ’ninety-seven drought,
She saw the light at a wayside pub,-
On the Gunbar road, in a patch of scrub.
All the grass was gone, as of course you know,
And her mother died in a day or so.
But, knowing her breed, the publican,
To save the foal tried a novel plan—
The water was scarce as was milk that year,
So he took to rearin’ the foalori beer !
An’ every day she drank her drop
Until she became a slave to the Hop 1
You talk of a thirst—
’Twas the very worst
With which a creature was ever curst l
Now as she grew
Her thirst swelled too,
Till affairs at the pub got pretty blue !
She was soaking the profits up every day,
And so things stood when I came that way.
I saw the filly—l liked her style—
I gave her a “go ” for half-a-mile ;
And then, when her pedigree I’d seen,
I bought her, and christened her ’Bidgee Queen.
I put her in “ work ” —as the trainers do—
An’ picked up a shearers’ race or two,
But she got that fall in the Sheoak Cup,
So I gave her a spell till the wound healed up.
Then got her in “ nick ” for a meeting in Hay,
An’ she won a double for me that day
(She had pace an’ wind ! She was more than game 1)
An’ down in Balranald she did the same.
Oh, Lord 1 How the wealth rolled in on me—
I’d a pile of quids that was good to see !
I swore I’d a fortune in ’Bidgee Queen ;
Then I raked together my every “ bean,”.
An’ on her it went —
Yes ; every cent—
For the Handicap at the Moulamein !
I rode to the booth before the race,
An’ I said to the feller who ran the place,
“Draw me a bucket of beer. Make haste ! ”
He did ; an’ I gave the mare a taste.
Then I pulled her back, an’ i said : “ Look here,
You win the race an’ you take the beer ! ”
We all lined up, there were nine or ten
At the post. A break or two, and then
Down went the flag, an’ away we sped,
An’ a colt from Moolpa went out an’ led.
At the half-mile post I was lyin’ back
Close to big Darkie an’ Mulga Jack.
Then I saw the blue
Of old Kangaroo
Steadily threading the others through !
Out he went, till at last he led —
Then I eased my hold on the bay mare’s head.
She went through the field like an arrow then
As though they were standing—nags an’ men 1
An’ the whip came out on Kangaroo
As up to his shoulders the game mare drew.
He was rolling, beaten, and bathed in foam,
An’ I led the field round the turn for home !
The stakes an’ the bets were as good as mine—
In fancy I saw the sovereigns shine !
When all of a sudden the mare went wide,
An’ bored right out to the far outside !
An’ pull as I might, an’ swear aloud,
She took me straight for the yelling crowd !
Over the rails like a bird she flew,
An- the people scattered an’ let her through.
■On she went like a shootin’ star,
And she propped with her chest at the flamin' bar—
■ Looked for the beer, an’ when she struck it,
Drank till she emptied the blanky bucket!
Broke —clean broke —all my winnings gone—
Like the future wealth I had counted on !
An’ I swore an oath ere f left her back
That she’d try no more on a racing track !
An’ since that day there never has been
Colors upon the ’Bidgee Queen ;
For I’ve stuck to the runs and sheds since then,
An’ I’ve done some trips with the drover men.
But that small place
Saw our last race,
And never again the flag did we face.
So she carries my swag,
An’ my tucker bag,
But she once carried colors, did that there nag !

“ Quan ” : Brer Fox is continuing his
march northwards. He is now considerably closer
to the Gulf than when “Machete” (B. 17/9/’08)
reported his presence on the Balonne (S.Q.). A
month or two ago one was seen on Westland
station, near Longreach (C.Q.), and two of him
were lately poisoned on Coreena station, which is
further north than Westland.
“J.G.”: The wheat cockies up on the
Yic. northern plains are singing out that they
cannot get enough men to do the harvesting this
season. The work of constructing the Waranga-
Mallee irrigation channel is giving employment to
a lot of men ; so the cockies say that the channel-
ing should be stopped by the Government, or
somebody, and the men turned adrift until the
harvest has been gathered in. The cockies could,
however, get the men now if they offered decent
wages and conditions. Consider things : —(1)
Harvest hands must work from jackass to jackass,
about 16 hours a day; (2) wages are tucker and
4s. to ss. per day, sometimes less ; (3) men must
look after the horses, or help draft sheep,
on Sundays; (4) no extra pay for Sunday work.
On the other hand, channel workers (1) work
eight hours per day ; (2) get 7s. and Bs.
per day; (3) have no Sunday work. Mostly
when a in .In can’t work steadily all the
year round—a jockey, for instance, or G. Reid,
K.C.— he expects to be extra-well paid for the
time he is working. But the farm-laborer isn’t
allowed the benefit of this rule; wherefore the
cocky who offers him fourpenee an hour for a 15-
hours day, knocks off every now and then to
marvel at his own liberality. And then he
wonders why he isn’t rushed by these casual
hands. Even in an extra-good year, when he
wants extra help to take in his extra crops, he
won’t pay extra money—the idea of bidding
higher than other employers of casual labor, and
thus getting the men he wants, never occurs to
him. If it did, it would only give him shivers
and cold jumps.
FIE FIDO.
LADY (member of W.C.T.U.): “ Oh, please would
you mind fetching my little dog Fido out of
that public house?”
OBLIGING LOAFER: “ Certainly , mum! Which

AS OTHERS SEE US.
DAMAGED LADY: “ Believe me, Clarice, if them huzzies there could only see wot ’orrible sights
they look they'd ’ide their ’eads with shame."
“ Cict” : About the most expansive menu
card in the bush is that on the table of the
laughing jackass, alias goburra. He turns
not with any considerable abhorrence from the
tiniest insect. Most grains, and even bread, he
consumes with a smile ; and grubs, worms and
such tit-bits he dotes on. Snakes he hankers
after, and lizards he permits. Even carrion,
much defunct, he absorbs in times of famine and
strike and in out-of-work seasons. Moreover,
John has recently acquired the custom of
purloining the hen-wife’s nest-eggs and lately-
fledged Orpingtons, a depraved sort of pastime
which frequently encourages much shot to scamper
Jack-wards with malice
aforethought. And only
a pair of Sabbaths gone,
I constituted the audi-
ence while a brace of
Jack, or perhaps John
and his missus, engaged
in the task of dealing it
out to an adult and
highly-annoyed gohanna,
who was heroically en-
deavoring to ignore their
onslaughts with non-
success gleaming from
each pore along his
visage. The feathery
sarcasm disconcerted the
gohanna considerably,
and he crunched the at-
mosphere in hopeless at-
tempts to envelop his
tormentors. In vain did
the reptile scale an ad-
jacent eucalypt, the
while the bipeds urged
him on from the rear,
permitting his ascension
only just till the desired
height from Australia
was arrived at, when,
with a well-aimed clout
at his foot or his tail, he
would be dislodged in a
confused and careless
tangle on the heather,
and, simultaneously
therewith, the old lady
and her pard would score
heavily on wind and
point. After some 40
minutes hard milling,
the knock-out came. All
credit for it was due to
the Johness. Observing
an opening, she rushed
downwards with a sort
of fell swoop, just as her
lord was filling the go.’s
hopes with a flank attack,
and smbte him fairly on
the hbad, and even as I
proceeded to count him
out, the couple of them closed in and fatalised the
scrap. Thereafter both made for the one stump,
and between re-dressing and toilette-making
laughed a large and unnecessary laugh at the
long one’s expense. They had apparently just
done it for fun, as they didn’t even look at the
carcase after its spirit had hoofed it over Jordan.
THE LATE SEEPENT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The wife of a well-known resident, on entering her
drawing-room on Tuesday afternoon, was astonished to
find a four-foot tiger snake coiled up on the hearthrug.
The reptile was immediately killed. — A r .S. IF. country news
item.
Long ago a Serpent lay
In a Garden, so they say.
Shamelessly did he deceive
The First Lady—Mother Eve.
Pretty Eve had little lore,
Paris frocks she rarely wore.
Jealousy she never knew
(Adam was a husband true).
Flattery unto her ear
Sounded strange and sweet and dear.
Thus ’twas easy to deceive
Unsophisticated Eve.
But, grown wiser since the Fall,
When the Serpent makes a call,
Eve calls Adam from his toil,
Shows to him the deadly coil.
Then ferocious Adam slays
(Eve is wiser nowadays).

M.S. : Many thanks; but you will see the
ground has been pretty well covered... .F.L.P. : Heavy
and dull as lead ; and there’s a poor market for lead just
now Poultry Woman : The Bulletin’s early education
on the subject of how to select layers was neglected.
The only man in the office who professes to know any-
thing about it is the sporting editor. He says you can
tell them because they carry a bag in front of them,
cackle horribly, and mostly have a hooked beak. Per-
sonally, however, The B. prefers the totalisator....
Harry G. : The emotional young statesman who, in and
out of season, addresses his inamorata as “ Kid ” afflicts
us with the horrors in a mild form. There are but two
classes that address females as “ Kid,” viz., (1) importers
of Manchester goods, (2) indent clerks—and neither dares
to do it outside the sanctuary which a saloon or private
bar affords EdgarS.: A couple of verses from
“ Mother Never Drink Again ” are Uplifting :
Oh, promise Mother my words may touch your heart,
Something tells me that drink is turning your brain,
Now you have kissed that dear Bible in God’s name,
So my heart asks, “ Mother never drink again.”
Now take a lock of hair from your sailor boy,
Keep it, so not to make your promise in vain.
One more kiss, with a thought for father who’s dead,
While I murmur, “ Mother never drink again.”
But, taken for all in all, you would do well to sidestep
literature in favor of pick-and-shovel toil Thorold :
“ Experience Man ” would be good if it had a climax, but
it only tails off. “If I Should Go ” doesn’t go anywhere
in particular. “L’Envoi ”is a faint little thing E.G. :

mon, ordinary mesmeric performances not worth tup-

Dead Letter Office. Consequently the basket took it
Lucifer : “ Real Love Story ”is far too steep... Dolores :
“Aftermath” is a nicely-written wail, but (alas !) it is
only a wail. And this paper isn’t a whale for wails
Syd C.: “In the Garden ” and “ Restitution ” passed out
as too small and tender. “ Poet ” held for further con-
sideration Seecasey : There’s a lot of rhyme in it, but
that’s all.. .Blackboy : “ Secretary’s Dairy ” only middling
—not upper middling, but lower middling F.B.Q. :
“Bully Barnes” is only a string of commonplace inci-
dents in the life of a bad-tempered agriculturist....
8.W.8. : “Office Men” contains too many vague and
almost meaningless expressions, apparently introduced to

last false step at 3.30 p.m. (8/12/’08), and it landed
him in that wicker bourne whence no MS. returns....
G. :We are a-weary of the Oxonian who dwells in the

crude, and the main idea has been worked before though

not deserve this ! How deathly quiet the night seems !
Forget you !No!no ! I cannot. Why does your very pre-
sence rise up before me ? Go ! I say , and leave me. Why
this blazing torment? Why this living hell of mighty
hells? Curse you!” It is too dreary, or abusive, or
something...'Hairy W. I. : Writing excellent; verse,
sketch and joke rotten North Queenslander : Know of

be pasted in the hat of every wife, policeman, etc., in the
State :
Leave base minds to harbor suspicion,

Let ours be a nobler ambition,
For base is the mind that suspects.
Exile : Thanks, but there is no demand for samples of
the North Queensland stinging-tree in this office. Try
either a Freetrade daily or a religious weekly.... Ihe
Wasp: One verse from “ The Broken-down Larrikin
goes—mainly by reason of its throbbing pathos :
Strike me pink, I was solid when a member of the push ;
In a scrap I was as willing as a lion.
Now I feel that bloomin’ weak and gouty in the legs,
I couldn’t knock a chop off a g ridiron.

Such a well-worn theme needed more powerful treatment.
Edith G. : None quite up to the mark, though the

smartly written, but too short and flimsy N.C.M’L. :
Very smooth and even, but rather weak and artificial
A.M’G. : One Verse from “ Good Night ” :
Oh ! Harry, I love you, my dearest !
Your presence is soothing and pleasing.
I feel your affection’s sincerest,
My spirit a kindred is meeting.
Proof that an engaged female used language of this sort

Moderately meritorious ; but we don’t care for allegories.

quire consummate skill Mary S. : Shows promise ; but

some of it, we found that we had been wasting our time.
Jago : Hasn’t quality enough for the Christmas —or
any other—number....Carte‘Rouge : Just a little too
“rouge” for print... .Louis Blake: Sorry they don’t
quite suit us The Plunger : You have the poetic feel-
ing ; but “ reminiscent ” verse of that stamp requires a
stronger hand.... G.O. : When we reached in “ The Im-

of men of the bulldog breed ” we suspicioned that you
W'ere most of the things a Bulletin versifier should not

You say, amid many wild ravings, that Bent “is con-
sidered by the intelligent and thinking portion of this
province” (Victoria) “as the best Premier Victoria has
ever had.” In such a case, we can only urge you to get
immediate medical advice... Warrumbucca: The bachelor-
tax sounds all right, but often it’s all wrong. Quite a
large proportion of bachelors batch because they are too
poor to marry, or because they have family responsibili-
ties other than wives and children. There are about
110,000 widows in the Commonwealth, and they can’t all
take in washing.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC) CONTRIBUTORS.
Haraz: “Drunk” joke not strong enough to support
the “ Drunk ” picture, and “ Drunk ” picture not strong
enough to support the “Drunk” joke, wherefore both
fell into the ditch J.E.8.: For absolute poisonousness
your drawings beat prussic acid, and as suggestions they
are useless..... Havaz : Drawings not up, and the quips
appended are mature products of the Castanea Vesca, or
chestnut tree V.R. : Painfully stiff variety of art
Oliver J. : Have no use for photos, of a bushfire in
Maoriland. Come over here when our drought is on
again and learn what afire really is Sigma :No points
at all about either picture J.K.S.: Crude and im-
pressionistic. Wouldn’t reproduce well even if we
badly wanted to reproduce it, which we don t....N.
Brown : Fish joke won’t hold water. —M. (Little River):
No hope at all Bro.: No merit. Not even a pretence
of merit Bourke: Pictures hopeless, not to say
inhuman. The address you mention is right enough
L.Mc. : Picture not much good. Also it is premature.
There is no certaintv that that politician is dead yet....
W. R. Mac. : No visible point, and sketch far below par.
B.W. : The joke is old. The joke is dirty. Thejokeisn’t
any good. The picture is horrible. You are horrible.
Farewell.... H.B. (Peel): Jokes poor, and of the drawings
it suffices to say that men have been shot dead, ere this,
for more venial offences.

TAKING AN EARLY MORNING DRINK TO STEADY HIM.
Premier Ward, of Maoriland, says that the financial stringency is passing away. The Advances to Settlers Department is bringing £100,000 a month of
foreign loan money into the Dominion, and other departments are also borrowing manfully, and in consequence prosperity is being restored.
After the patient has had his early morning drink he will feel able to empty the financial snakes out of his boots and attend to a little business.

An action for infringement of trade-mark was
settled by consent before Mr. Justice A’Beckett in the
Practice Court, Melbourne, on Wednesday, 25th Novem-
ber. The plaintiff was Udolpho Wolfe Co., proprietors of
Wolfe’s Schnapps, of New York. The plaintiff company
claimed an injunction to restrain the defendants from
selling Meijer’s Schnapps under a label which, the plaintiff
alleged, was got up so as to resemble the label of Wolfe’s
Schnapps. By consent, a perpetual injunction restrain-
ing the defendants from selling Meijer’s Schnapps in the
manner complained of was granted.*
Mr. William Francis, Launceston, Tas.,

tried many Remedies, but nothing did me any

I was, recommended me to take Chamberlain’s

and had only taken about four doses when I
obtained relief. lam a commercial traveller, and

When hebe struck.
[For The Bulletin.]
The Nelson (M.L.) barmaids struck, last week, as a
protest against, the manifesto issued by the local brewers
to the no-license party offering to do away with female
bar-tenders.
My tongue was dry as George Reid’s dog,
I had a blazing thirst;
I could have lounged beneath a keg
And drunk until I burst ;
But I had landed in a town
Where brewers were accurst.
The barmaids had gone out on strike,
They would not pull the pump—
For threats of Bung and wheedlings
They did not care a dump.
The barrels rotted down below—
’Twould give a man the hump.
I saw a warmly lighted pub ;
I dashed within the door
Where men were clamoring for booze,
But vainly they did roar.
The publican was blubbering
Upon the barren floor.
Against the shelves a maiden leaned,
As cold-faced as a bier.
“ Fair one,” I said, “give me a pewt.
And I will sixpence steer
Across to you.” She merely said:
“ A quid can’t buy a beer.”
I fled me to “ The Cloven Hoof”—
A decent pub I know—
But there the pump had ceased to pump,
The cask had ne’er a flow,
And all the flasks stood silently
As corpses in a row'.
All through the town ’twas just the same,
The Thirsts crept sadly round,
And each one sought a place to lap,
But not a lap they found.
The brewer’s beer was Dead Sea fruit
When Hebe on it frowned.
M.L. B.
Dr. John Holden Webb, a Melbourne
surgeon who died on Thursday, aged 62, came to
Australia 36 years ago. His earliest diploma was
London, 1865. He had been an assistant-surgeon
in the army, and in London was house-surgeon to
the male and female Lock hospital. In Melbourne
he settled in Exhibition-street, known in its wild
and wicked days as Stephen-street. The name
was changed many years ago because Stephen-
street was reminiscent of many things, amongst
the rest the well-known lady of loose virtue,
“ Mother Frazer,” long since defunct. But Ex-
hibition-street smelt just as badly as . Stephen-
street until the recent cleaning up took place.

HIS OLD BOSS: “ Well, well, I'm -! What
won’t he be doing next! ”
Ben James, of the Liberal and Reform
Association, who died suddenly last week in his
office in Castlereagh-street, Sydney, was a native
of the city, born 62 years ago in Harris-street,
where his father, also named Benjamin, carried on
business as a builder and cedar dealer. In business
life 25 years ago Benjunior was of the firm of Barker
and James, wholesale grocers and produce dealers,
who traded in Clarence and Market streets. The
deceased carried a heap of political influence.
No one knew exactly how he got it, but he cert-
ainly had it. Wade offered to send him to the
Leg. Council a while ago ; but he declined.
A -p n ® m essage that Agent-General
Alfred Dobson sent to the Tasmanian Government
was one of thanks for the offer of the third Judge-
S ", l P’ but declining it on the ground of “private
affairs. Then he took a trip to Paris, and mys-
teriously dropped overboard in -the Channel.
Alfred, a younger brother of Senator Henry, had
re-married only a few months ago.
Herbert Nicholls has been appointed third
Jtidge of Tasmania, vice the late Justice
A. 1. Clark. Nicholls ought to be a
worthy successor of the big man who
has gone before. He is a product
of the Tasmanian University,
and, like the late A. I. Clark, „
has strongly supported its
interests since he gra-
duated. He is a good
Australian, a good
rifle-shot (he recently
represented Tas-
mania at the big
inter-State meetings
on the mainland),
and has long and
warmly advocated
compulsory mili-
tary training. He
has represented
Hobart in the
House of Assembly
for years, and held
office in the Prop-
sting Ministry, when
“ Proppy,” at the
general elections of
1903, threw out every
Minister of the Neil
Lewis Government.
But whereas “ Proppy ”
has taken the political
line of least resistance,
Herbert Nicholls has
stood firm. Up till
recently he wasleader
of the Opposition,
and he has always
been in the front of
the Liberal Demo-
cratic League a
body which has for
its purpose the de-
struction of the
power of the ultra-
Tory House of
Dodery. But
though Herbert
Nicholls has well
earned his promo-
tion it is a grievous
pity that so bril-
lianfc a politician
should be buried among
the legal cobwebs of the Bench.
A recent applicant for the Queensland old
age pension was the widow of one of the men who
accompanied Patrick Leslie, the pioneer of the
Darling Downs (Q.), when he took up Canning
Downs station in 1840. The old lady is 89 years
ot age, and among the references accompanying
her application was a recommendation to her
husband by Captain Wickham, first Government-
Resident of Queensland, dated September 27,
1000.
James Hebbard was chairman of the con-
ference which fixed up things between the miners
and the majority of the mine-owners of
Broken Hill after the Broken Hill Prop,
—the biggest concern—broke away.
Hebbard, who began life as a small boy
m a Bendigo mine, battled his way
through the School of Mines on that
field, got a shift boss’s job in the early
days of Broken Hill, climbed up to mine
management, and then accepted a Govern-
ment mine-inspectorship. The big Eng-
lish-owned Sulphide Corporation decided
after a while that the inspector knew a
lot of the tilings about working dan-
gerous ground that it badly wanted to
know itself, so Hebbard became mine
manager for the big English co. ; and
the fixing up of this two-years’ agree-
ment on what looked like the edge of a
furious strike, is another peacock’s
feather in his hat. For even if he didn’t
do all the hard work, and pour out all the
oil, he was chairman ; and the chairman
has first grab always at whatever feathers
are lying around.
Another of “Eddy’s men ” died in
Westralia lately Thomas Patterson,
that State’s Chief Railway Auditor.
Eddy, who knew Patterson’s appetite
for railway figuresin England, brought
him out as an audit inspector ; but later
on he went across to his friend, John
Davies, then general manager of the
Westralian railways. Patterson was a
weary and lonely old bachelor, who had
wiu oaonciui, WIIU licit l
lived a hotel life nearly all his days, and hadn’t
found it very satisfactory.
Purveyors of rumor anent the forthcoming
appointment to the N.S.W. Chief Justiceship are
now split up into two decisive and loudly-
spoken camps. One alleges clamantly that the
bauble has been offered to and has been accepted
by C. E. Pilcher, K.C. The other, with equal
uproar, makes the statement that Premier Wade
has decided to grab it himself. The latter con
tingency seems too remarkable to be true.
Mr. Frederic Lassetter, whose 80th birth-
day was celebrated in Sydney last week, is a type
of the evergreen Australian. He is as full of
working ideas to-day as when auctioneering in
Melbourne nearly 60 years ago. His father was
part farmer and part schoolmaster in Tasmania,
but Frederic struck out early to open his life
oyster. He and a pony did practically the whole
of the early work of the Lassetter firm.
The human half of the partnership kept
the books, made most of the sales, collected
accounts and interviewed sellers. The pony
was his inseparable companion in pilgrimages,
and is said to have had as keen a scent
for business as the rider. When the rider
boarded a boat at Circular Quay to obtain a fore-
look at an incoming cargo, the pony had to be
tied up to a post, and painfully the beast
whinnied, apprehensive that his master might be
imposed on. Colonel Lassetter is one well-known
son ; . Fred Lassetter, of the Irish Rifles, is
another ; and still another well-known son was
Father Lassetter, member of a R.C. religious
order.
E. E. Hill, Bridgetown, W.A., writes :
“From personal experience I can testify to the
efficacy of Chamberlain’s Cough Remedy. Last
winter I was troubled with a very bad cough, and
tried Chamberlain’s Cough Remedy, which
quickly cured me. Now I keep a bottle on hand,
and take a dose at the first symptom of a cold, and
have never since had a cold or cough.”
Hero, one of the black-trackers carted
down from Cooktown to hunt the Kellv gang,
is still a lively old warrior at Bowen (N.Q.).
In these latter degenerate days Hero spends a
good deal of time relating his adventures after the
ironclad bushranger, and with the fiction which
he has woven into his narrative he can mostly
score a few pints.
INFLUENCE OF THE PRESS.
At Wallan East to-day a bullock, that had picked up a
sheet of newspaper on his horns, ran wild in the main
street, doing considerable damage and ultimately break-
ing his own neck .—Melbourne AGE.
Isn’t that exactly how the public performs on
occasions when blindfolded by the “ great dailies ”?
The Hawkesbury River (N.S.W.) has lost
one of its characteristic monster human growths
by the death of Prosper Tuckerman, well over 20
stone in his prime. Fully a score of other mon-
sters, however, survive. A big-bodied man does
not strike a visitor to the district as forcibly as the
same bulk would strike elsewhere, for Nature has
a habit of running to bigness all over that region.
Trees and turnips, horses, cattle and sheep, and
even fowls attain huge dimensions. Tuckerman
died at 76, all but a few years of the time being
passed within cooee of the River. He leaves
about a dozen descendants to carry on the line.
Primate Smith—he of the shilling cab—
shows close on 18 years to his credit as an im-
ported bishop. His predecessor, Barry, tired in
five years, and returned
to the land of the lost
aspirate. Barker stayed
28 years, but married so
often that apparently
he didn’t feel time
flying. Broughton, too,
did a fair term—l 7
years. All Sydney heads
of the Church of Eng-
land have, so far, de-
clined to lay their bones
in this country, whereas
Chief Justices make local
burial a regular habit.
W. K. Hulke, one
of Maori land’s old
settlers, crossed the
Jordan recently, aged
89 years. He landed
in Wellington in 1840,
and he gets these few
lines because he intro-
duced the first cows to
Wellington and Tara-
naki, thereby originat-
ing the great and sacred
industry of Cow. Since
then, Cow has been
greatly exalted, until
she has become the god-
dess of Wellington and
Taranaki. The man who devises any new form of
.worship, even if it be only of the Cow variety,
deserves some mention when he goes out. Hulke
also erected the first flour mills at Wanganui and

The cable-waster was too busy saying that
Mrs. Brown-Jones was also present to mention
lately that Saville Kent had died in England.
Kent, a very large authority on pearl-fishing,
spent some years as Commissioner of Fisheries in
Queensland, and wrote “ The Great Barrier Reef
of Australia.” Later on he did some work of the
same sort for the Westralian Government, which
was just then busy crooking one finger towards
the Torres Straits divers, and pointing with
another to its own nor’-western oyster-beds.
Kent, who had another Australian trip planned,
was 56 when he shipped with Charon, instead of
with the P. and O.
About a man with a theory
Passed to a land where “finance” is at a discount,
J. VV. Foster Roy ers, of Malvern (Vic.)- Born at Leeds in
1841, Rogers cut no ice to speak of till ’94, when he
casually put up for South Yarra against the veteran Joe
Harris. Harris was amused, and took a trip down the
Baj’ on election day. But Foster Rogers had gone to the
trouble of personally interviewing ever}' elector, and
Harris’ carelessness cost him his seat. Still it was a
snatch victory, for Rogers failed next election, and a
final flutter, a few years back, cost him his deposit. His
political platform practically consisted of one plank—a
Surplus Wealth Tax—and a scrappy policy like that
couldn’t carry the cleverest politician for long. Turner
once appeared somewhat impressed by the Surplus
Wealth Tax, but abandoned it in favor of the simpler and
less uncertain Income Tax. Some years ago when that
amazing legal person, Senator Gould, was doing the gasbag
act to the effect that the Constitution made a Federal
graduated land-tax unlawful, and The Bulletin vainly
offered him, week after week, a large sum of money if he
would show any clause to that effect, Foster Rogers took
up the challenge on Gould’s theory. The matter was re-
ferred to two barristers, and the barrister whom Foster
Rogers selected biffed out F. Rogers’ (and Gould’s) case
even more emphatically than the barrister The Bulletin
selected.
Allen Taylor, having made a tour of the
world and put his hard head into a few dozen
foreign town halls, gets back in time to be re-
elected gaud-Mayor of Sydney; and Thomas
Hughes quits the job once more without getting
the label that has been pasted on to a much
smaller man—Weedon, of. Melbourne. Taylor, a
Goulburn (N.S.W.) native, makes municipal work
a hobby. Tor years he was one of the 500 or so
aldermen who potter about with municipal govern-
ment in the 45 Sydney suburban councils ; and he
was mayor of the city in 1904-6. At his elbow
stands “ Bob” Anderson, who used to be Town
Clerk of Sydney and is now Taylor’s partner in
Allen Taylor and Co. —one of the timber concerns
that have been coining money these last few years.
They are both men of vast energy—Taylor’s is
something of the bulldog variety—and, being
both good Protectionists, they have turned a few
odd pounds of it lately on to the Australian
Star, of which Anderson has become boss director.
Howard. Freeman, whose name is Henry
Louis Rosenberg, has been telling the N.S.W.
Bankruptcy Court how he trained to build up the
biggest “medical institute” business that Aus-
tralia ever knew. An American, Rosenberg
started off as a tobacco salesman ; then went into
dry-goods; then swiftly passed into the printing
business, came out to these parts and worked as a
compositor at John Sands’ printery, next tried
advertising canvassing (that was in conjunction
with Jules Joubert, the Exhibition man), and
finally stepped into the advertising-quack business
about 20 years ago. For a while he was “Dr.
Howard Freeman”—he wrote a “thesis” for a
Michigan “University,” sent £B, and got a
diploma. Afterwards he dropped the “Dr.,”
and hired registered medi cal men and women
and owns up to a personal expenditure for many
years of an annual £2OOO or £2500. Finally
Mauger slammed the door of the Post Office in his
face, and t hen his troubles started to pour in.
“ D.” about an archbishop :
The appointment of the Bishop of Stepney (England) to
the Archbishopric of York will arouse bitter grief in the
hearts of Anglican Low Churchers the world over. For
Cosmo Lang, who was erst of Stepney, and is now of
York, is in his customs—whatever his views may be—a
Papist of the most flamboyant type. I rarely go to
church, but a friend dragged me to hear Lang preach
when I was in England, alleging that he was a marvel.
It was an interesting show in many ways. The preacher
proved to have the voice and diction of a finished actor.
Add tt> it a manner of fanatic earnestness w'hich is Lang’s,
and you get a useful combination for clerical purposes.
His face is the face of some ascetic cardinal, and not at
all the face of the ordinary Church of England dignitary,
who mostly looks what he mostly is—a genial, tolerant,
well-fed, brainy man of affairs. As to Lang’s costume
when officiating, a Church paper described some of it, the
other day, thus wise :
“ A dark blue cassock rochet, cream colored stole,
jewelled pastoral cross, yellow brocade cope with peacock
blue fringe and gold ospreys, and a mitre embroidered
with gold.”
Like many another lover of the gaudy in religion, the
new Archbishop is a friend to Britain’s frequent poor
man, and a wondrously charitable soul to all.

Queensland Premier Kidston was stirred
by his native heather to write some more verse.
It is about 16 years since he was last known to
have been guilty of it. On that occasion The
Bulletin printed his lines —they had something
to do with the shearers’ strike. Kidston’s new
outbreak is addressed “ To an Auld Schoolmate at
Hame,”and it contains this bit, no doubt auto-
biographical
Some ha’e plodded on, aye doucely, in the quiet road o
life,
And ha’e found the pleasant meadows where content and
comfort’s rife ;
Some wi’ high ideals burning as they started on their
way,
Have, at pleasure’s beck’ning swerving, wandered sadly
far astray.

MISERY
INDIGESTION
\ Sydney Woman Tells How
the Tonic Treatment with
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills
Cured Her.
The processes of digestion are controlled by the
blood and nerves. That is why the tonic treat-
ment, by which the blood is built up, has cured so
many cases of stubborn stomach trouble.
Many people are suffering daily from stomach
trouble, because they cling to old-fashioned
methods, eat predigested foods, and in other ways
aggravate the disorder they seek to cure. But
prejudice must give away before proof, such as
this statement by Mrs. David Gravey, 73 Gibbons
Street, Bed fern.
“For several years I was troubled off and on
with indigestion. My appetite was very poor, on
my bad days I’d hardly touch a morsel of food.
My tongue was always coated thickly, and I had a
taste in my mouth as if I had been sucking bitter
aloes. My food lay like a ton weight on my chest,
and I could hardiy get my breath. My heart
fluttered if I walked quickly, and I’d get dull
headaches at the back of my head, and a pain
across my forehead just above the eyes. The
doctor’s treatment did me no good, and then,
through my cousin, I tried Dr. Williams’ Pink
Pills. From the first my appetite improved
wonderfully, and, to my great relief, I found after
eating that the food didn’t lie so heavy on my
chest. I began to get back my strength and felt
brighter. After the first two boxes I felt
such an improvement that I went and bought two
more. I knocked off at the sixth box, and I felt
better than I had done for years. After a spell I
took two more boxes at intervals. They fully
completed my cure.”
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills are good for any com-
plaint that a supply of rich red blood is good for,
but one needs to be careful to get the genuine, as
substitutes sometimes offered are useless. They
are sold by most chemists and storekeepers,
price 2s. 9d. per box ; six boxes, 15s. 3d.; or, if they
cannot be obtained locally, will be sent, post free,
on receipt of price by the Dr. Williams’ Medicine
Co. of Australasia, Ltd., Sydney.

POLITICAL
POINTS
THE REIGN OF PEACE.
Archbishop Clarke told the Anglican Synod in Mel-
bourne that people in England would scarcely believe
that the churches in Australia were on such friendly
terms with each other.
ARCHBISHOP CLARKE: “Look at the little
darlings. Ain't they just sweet? And so
playful, too! "
JOHN BULL: “ Tare-an'-’ounds! Wot would they
be like ef they wuz ’ostile? ”
The sole issue at the present Victorian
elections is Bent versus Straight.
The figures just published giving the areas
of alienated land in N.S.W. clamor for a
graduated land-tax. Forty-five per cent, is
owned by 728 persons, and one-fifth of the
privately-owned landed property in the State is
in the hands of 100 holders. Altogether 81,732
persons are landowners, of whom 44,000 hold less
than 100 acres each and 104 persons own over
50,000 acres each. About 1,500,000 people own
no land at all. And though the Tory press
assures the people that the lan'd monopolists are
voluntarily cutting up their big estates at a great
rate, the reduction in the total area comprised in
holdings of more than 10,000 acres each has, in the
last 12 months, only amounted to 0 - 02 per cent.
The manifesto issued to the Victorian
electors by the local Liberal party a day or two
ago contains this information :
The acts of maladministration of the Bent Government
are legion ; its improper use of the public purse is
notorious. An imperative duty of the new Parliament is
to examine the expenditure of the Treasurer in the past
few years. We venture to predict that the exposures
that would result would amaze the country, and they
would fully explain the tenacity with which the Premier
has clung to office in the face of a hostile majorhy.
He fears to be found out.
“Boko”: Frankly, I do not like the
Fisher Ministry, for six of its members are not
Australians, six are not Protectionists, and six
are sectarians. Can’t we Australians breed our
own leaders, untainted with Old World ideas and
untrammelled by Old World traditions. Damn
it, I ask, can’t we ?
According to Rockefeller, Standard Oil
has up to now paid £118,000,000 in dividends.
The profits last year were £16,000,000. And
sooner than see this monster forego one of its
multitudinous millions, the Australian Parliament
gladly allows the struggling Australian oil in-
dustry to be strangled. That is what the refusal
of a duty amounts to.
The Vic. Select Committee which is
inquiring as to the preference given to Aus-
tralian productions by State departments
haled nine departmental heads before it
the other day, and of the whole lot only one
—Dr. Norris, of the Health Department—
was able to swear that he got everything possible
made locally, and that his official return of im-
portations was correct. The other eight, as well
as Railway Boss Tait, assured the Committee that
it hadn’t occurred to them that Parliament in-
tended its resolution to be taken seriously. A
Government that honestly intended to carry out
Parliamentary instructions would, however, have
seen that the idea did occur to those gentlemen.
SAME OLD SPECTRE CHASE.
Two hundred and fifty applications have been received
by tbe Victorian Lands Department for 48 blocks of land
at Pinnaroo .—News Item.
G. Reid, having handed over the leader-
ship of the party-witliout-a-hope to J. Cook, has
made his first appearance as an advocate of co-
opera-tion. Amongst other things Greid finds :
There are 12,000 village banks in Germany, mostly un-
limited, and never yet have they lost one customer a
penny.
G. Reid might get up a few more facts like that,
and hand them over to Cook : they would come
in so handy to him when next he has to dwell on
the horrors of Protection, and the decay and dis-
tress of Protectionist countries, and the evils of
Socialism.
Further investigations into the ways*of
the “thrifty” Victorian landowner, who won’t
pay his land-tax till a special “detective ” officer
is laid on to ferret out his rascalities,
have discovered eight more soil-grabbers,
who own 17,575 acres, for which they
have been paying nothing, and four who
have been passing themselves off as
owning 4753 acres less than they really
did own : all these in three shires—
Yea, Howqua, and Alexandra. (This
last shire, by the way, is at present
raising Henry senr. because it has to
find £9O worth of fencing for its new
line of railway.) These twelve landown-
ers will in future find themselves col-
lectively some £366 a year poorer, unless
they can think up some other dodge. In
view of these things, and in view of the
things he has done in connection with
the Land Valuation Bill, etc., what view does
Premier Bent honestly take of himself ?
At last the woman vote is a sure thing- in
Victoria ; and about the first plain result will be
a change in things in Melbourne. The
man who rents a 10 x 9 city office has
come in from his subbub where Fat was
safe and has voted in Melbourne ; but
Mrs. 10 x 9 will have to vote in her
subbub, while the woman who lives in
the mean street of the city will drop in
her vote at the same booth as Bill, her
husband. She does that already in the
Federal elections ; wherefore “thelittle
doctor” is M.H.R. for Melbourne
City.
Bent is still at it. He has now tried to
nobble a few farming votes by issuing an order
reducing the valuations of Crown lands about to be
thrown open and abolishing “loading.” In effect,
this means the upsetting of almost every land
transaction in wbieh the State has been con-
cerned during the last few years ; for all who have
paid “ loading” will want the money refunded, and
those who have bought Crown lands on the higher
valuations will naturally want them reduced to
the present figures. And the disorderly, higgledy-
piggledy affairs of the Lands Department will be
in a worse mess than ever.
A domestic note which gives another
glimpse of the glories of Preetrade :
I have just received a letter from my sister, dated
Manchester, October 22. On going to church the previous
Sunday she was, she says, surprised to see 20 policemen
in the churchyard. On inquiring she was told that the
unemployed were expected, and, as anticipated, about
100 turned up. “The service was most pitiful, the
majority of the congregation being in tears. Most of the
unemployed were quite young men, and they did not
create any disturbance. At the close of the service the
collection was handed over to the Lord Mayor of Man-
chester’s Fund.
Bent became more garrulous even than
usual just after his defeat in the Vic. Assembly.
He talked of So-and-So, whom “he could have
bought for 30 bob”; of Thingummy, “who
said he could never thank me enough for all the
things I did for East Gippsland ” ; of Whats-
isname, “whom I placed on the Geelong Harbor
Trust.” He gave it all away with refreshing
candor—merely intimated his firm faith in bribery
and corruption, and his disgust that his favors
should be at last rewarded with the kick-out.
A SORROWFUL CROWD.
(With apologies to “Hop.”)
LITTLE 'UN : “ There is one section of the Aus-
tralian public, sir, that deplores your retire-
ment from public life."
THE OLD 'UN : “ Always glad to hear of any
expression of appreciation of my humble—er—
but, by the way, which section is it? ”
LIŢLE 'UN : “ The caricaturists.”
GONSOLITIS.
A slight fall has taken place in the price of Consols,
due, it is said, to the King’s indisposition.
COURT PHYSICIAN : “ You see, pour Majesty, it's
not what you might call an ordinary case.
If these beastly Consols of yours get dis-
arranged again I shan't be able to answer for
the consequences. You must be extremely
careful not to," etc., etc.
Bent has lost many followers, but the
one whose secession most angers the discredited
Adolphus is ex-Minister and Holy Man, George
Swinburne. Swinburne declared that the Bent
Government was “persistently unprogressive,”
and for that reason he left it during the recon-
struction, a few weeks back. Yet, on Murray’s
want-of-confidence motion, Swinburne voted not
against Bent but for him. Now he is an inde-
pendent and anti-Bent candidate. A mighty
wobbler before the Lord is gasman Swinburne.
The announcement that British Judges
and magistrates have been forbidden to
release convicted persons on a guarantee
that they will emigrate to Australia is a
salutation to the Australian flag.' But
Australia in its time sent many con-
victed criminals to England. When
Britain garrisoned Australia the
returning soldiers generally took
back with them to England convict
women, who were given free par-
dons for the purpose. Macquarie,
writing to Viscount Castlereagli,
apologised plaintively in a despatch:
“ I have been induced to grant
more free pardons than I could
have wished ; but, in order to en-
able a number of women who had
lived for many years with [soldiers
of the 102nd Regiment to marry
those men and accompany them
Home, I judged it expedient with
that view to grant them free par-
dons, as it relieved the Govern-
ment from the expense of victual-
ling and supporting these women
and their children.”
It took 25 years of striving to win for women
the right to vote for the State Parliament of Vic-
toria ; and during that time nine Government
and seven private Bills were tossed out. Yet the
Victorian women showed much more calm
patience and persistence than the suffragettes of
England ; for not even when most disappointed
did they descend to rabid rioting or passionate
uproar. Those who have done much of the bat-
tling met in Melbourne the other day to congratu-
late each other ; but of the little band which drew
up the first platform in 1884 only two were left—
Mrs. Johnson and Mrs. Lowe. The latter is a
white-haired, sweet-faced dame of 75, with a lusty
sense of humor and a joyous gift of repartee.
Others there were who helped valiantly—Dr.
Bromby, Geo. Higinbotham, Mrs. Rennick,
David Syme, Vida Goldstein ; but few of them
are left to see the fruits of those long years of
apparently hopeless labor.
From the Victorian press gallery :
Bent’s taste for tbe dubious seems to be instinctive.
Recently, when begot his dissolution from the too-ready
State Gover-nor, he had Parliament dissolved without
meeting the House. Palpably he had funked the meet-
ing and wanted to save explanations, but what everybody
began to ask was, where did Adolphus get the money
to carry on ? He certainly declared that he had enough
money without asking for fresh supplies, but as the
Government accounts to be paid this month amount to
several hundred thousand pounds, his declaration is
open to serious doubt. He hasn’t, at any rate, enough
money in his Treasurer’s advance, nor is it at all likely,
considering who Bent is, that he has a large amount of
unspent money lying about loose. There is a suspicion
that the awful old blunderer is borrowing privately—
perhaps from the local savings bank—but as he can’t
legally pay money until it has been voted by Parliament,
even he would think twice of committing a folly of that
description. Yet he was in a hole, and it would only be
characteristic if he enlarged it to efface the traces of its
former occupancy. That is practically the substance of
Bent’s whole career—gradually and continually widening
the hole to kid people that it is quite a new hole. On-
day he will use up all of the firm ground, and will ha\
nothing to stand upon but orifice.
AN INSECT'S-EYE VIEW.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The striking feature of the Canadian booklets was the
name “ Canada,” which appeared on every leaflet in large,
bold lettering. New South Wales, Queensland, and Vic-
toria all had separate leaflets. These ought to be on the
Canadian system, in one booklet, and the one word
“ Australia.”—David Davis, of Sydney.
“Oh, no! We never mention her,
The name is never heard ”
What ! speak about Australia l
Preposterous ! Absurd !
She may exist—perhaps she does —
We hear all sorts of tales ;
It takes us all our time to buzz
For Noo-South-Wales !
We haven’t time to look about—
We can’t see Continents—
It takes us all our time to shout
For Wades and Moores and Bents !
Such men as these are mild and meek,
They’re courteous, and defer —
It takes us all our time to squeak—
“ Vic-tor-i-er ! ”
You see us fly—you hear us flit,
You know we are content ;
We. recognise that Wade is it
(That’s when it isn’t Bent).
In crevices and cracks and holes
We crawl about o’ nights,
And scratch and claw with all our souls
For our State rights !
We lurk behind a speck of paint,
Or in a blob of dirt,
And what we can’t see simply ain’t—
You take it, that’s a cert :
Outside of good old Melbin Town
Things simply don’t occur—
That’s why we skate and stridulate—
“ Vic-tor-i-er ! ”
Just see us stagger round, and flap,
And whiz, and make a fuss !
AUSTRALIA may be on the map,
But that’s no good to us !
We wouldn’t toss you half-a-crown
For anything that hails
From places outside Sydney Town—
That’s Noo-South-Wales !
Get out ! You never mean to say
There’s something North and West?
What! Part of this AUSTRALIA ?
Oh, come off—give it best !
Don’t pull our legs and wings like that;
Don’t tickle our antennae—
The world is this:
Buzz ! Whoosh ! Squeak ! Whiz !
Outside there isn’t Any !

.. Tfie elections in Jerusalem passed off quietly.— Stagger-
ing cable item.
Our last fond fair delusion’s shattered,
Our lonely phantasy is fled !
We thought we stood w here notiiino mattered ;
That all hopes, joys and fears were dead ;
Alas ! once more we make sw'eet moan—
Once more Grief claims us for her own.
There comes, per the unhallowed cable
Which caps this vile, commercial age,
In language worse than that of Babel,
A line which makes us boil with rage,
Astonishment, and doubt, and pity—
“ Elections in the Holy City ! ”
Picture it, all ye gods of eld —
Moloch, and Bel, and Ashtaroth !
The weird election-meetings held,
The bustle round the polling-booth,
The posters on the ancient wall’s—
“ Vote for Gehazi and Three Balls ! ”
Consider, if you can, a moment
The low estate of Judah’s lion—•
The noise, the turbulence, the foment,
The clash of parties in old Zion !
The cheers, the speeches, the hysteria,
The “ platform ” —first declared in Syria !
How shall we paint the vast disgust
That reigns in Moab? ’Twould o’ertask us.
How adequately show what bust
The Old Jew Pary in Damascus ;
Or what took place in Kishon’s valley
At the great Pan-Hebraic rail}' ?
O, for a pen that could describe
The party feuds and fierce dissensions
That separated tribe from tribe —
The battle over Old Age Pensions—
Free Circumcision at New Year—
The gallant fight for Kosher Beer !
State education (without Topliet),
High duties on phylacteries,
The poll-tax on each hairy prophet,
And many matters such as these—
Ye gods 1 to show in this short ditty
The frenzy in the Holy City !
In vain ! In vain ! Words will not come,
Our Pagan Muse is deaf or laggard ;
The oracles of Bel are dumb,
And we are absolutely staggered !
There is no help in Dis or Momus —
Our last illusion’s taken from us 1

ROBWR
The next time you go
to your Grocer for any-
thing, ask him to give you
a Robur Calendar. The
Pictures are, as usual,
copies of works of art in
the National Gallery, and
are better produced this
year than ever before.
It isn’t so much that the
Calendars are of any great
value that we suggest your
getting one as that they
are handy for reference
throughout the year, and
artistic little things to have
hanging up in one’s home.
We would also suggest
. that you use our tea—we
ought to have said our
good tea, for it really is-
good, as, .well as being nice
and very economical'.
The No. 1 Grade is
rich, full delightful flavored
vi tefa. We know of no tea
more suitable for every-
day “high-class” family
trade, and none that it will
pay better to use. i t.Z- i

A WOMAN’S LETTER.
Sydney, December 15, 1908.
My Dear Abini,—
Excellency Rawson, Miss, and the gilded ap-
purtenances are enjoying the heat and the cicada
orchestra of Moss Vale. The locusts’ chorus isn’t
any louder than at Cranbrook, but the heat i.s
dryer. Moisture lias been taken out of it by the
blotting-paper of distance.
For the breaking up at Rjverview College his
Fx. made a special trip from his hill-tops’ resi-
dence. He lost himself, or someone else did him
that wrong, m the winding ways of the Lane Cove
River, got to the wrong college, and only arrived
at the right Brain Emporium when the proceed-
ings were half over. However, he balanced
°y £ iy ing the boys an extra week’s holiday,
and three maxims for them to remember: “Never
say anything you would not like your mother or
sisters to hear ”; “ Never do anything you would
not like them to know of”; and “Never keep
company with anyone you would not like them to
meet. All of which was received with cheers.
Boys at a breaking-up will cheer the most im-
possible precepts in the good advice line. Some
of them, no doubt, will rush off during the week
to keep company with, or at least to make the
acquaintance of, Mr. Jack Johnson, but they would
not take him home to introduce him to mama and
the girls. Doubtless, Mr. J. J. would decline to
go it invited. Anyhow, Sir Harry’s advice is of
tised md that 1S a^ways P reac hed, but rarely prac-
Harold Parbury has returned to Sydney,
aiid flashes about daily with his beautiful wife in
a brand new and enormous motor-car. Her clothes
evoke gasps of misery as they whirl, which, after
all, is what a woman’s smartest clothes are there
tor. lam considering the formation of a- Society
for the Prevention of Cruelty to the Partially
Broke. One of the principal boards of its plat-
form would prohibit the wearing of Doucet frocks
in pflblic, under pain of knouting'.
Miss Celia Ghiloni married her Maepherson in
Bombay last month. The Hugh Wards and Miss
Brace Palotta, who are busking in that torrid
clime, attended at the ceremony and quaffed
fizzy wine to the future well-being of the pair
Ihe bride will be back in these parts next June’
trailing her new male possession behind her.
The engagement of Miss Enid Clift to Mr..
Horace Friend, sometime of this city, is an-
nounced. Thus descends from the hook one of
Sydney’s most alluring bachelors. For years he
has been dodging the match-making mothers of
two hemispheres. There were carpers who sug-
gested that he was shadow-sparring to a great
extent herein; and that the mothers were not so
avid on the trail as they were represented to be
Ihese disgruntled folk carried scant conviction.’
Ihe lady is tall and graceful, and comes of a
pastoral stock.
J-he McPhillamy-McDonalds are . spending
their honeycomb at Kubelik’s castle in Bohemia—
at least, so rumor has it. One or other of the
twain got friendly with the master fiddler before
the reaping of the orange blossoms; hence the
castle courtesy.
Baronet Lucas-Tooth and his wife have reached
these parts. He scored.the reward.of jaeer-making
on a large scale a couple of years ago, and signal-
ised the event by getting a royal license to prefix
the name Lucas and a hyphen, to the orio-inal
name of Eating Apparatus. The Lucas-Tooths
own the biggest house in Queen’s Gate, London
and a service of gold plate that is produced when
really important people come to dine. On other
occasions mere common silverware is used. The
Tooths could roll and wallow in the alleged root
of evil were they $o disposed. However, they
don’t roll. They are quite unlike the two bush
girls who won the first prize in Tatt.’s, and, hav-
ing heard that it was the right thing to do, spread
the sovereigns on the floor of a boarding-house
bedroom, and roiled over them in the altogether
till they were almost too bruised to live. 'All the
same, the Chewing Mechanism folk have a tender
regard tor gold and the importance and respect-
ability thereof. It is said that one of the first
words the infant Teeth were schooled to lisp in
their 90 x 80 day nursery was “ money.”
The feminine elements of the David Anderson
household—mother and three daughters—have
outward-bound intentions. They go Europeward
possibly on Boxing Day. Miss Anglin and
Manager Netlrersole depart next Saturday By
the same liner go Mrs. J. T. Toohey and “one of
her step-daughters.
“ Quambi,” which was built by the late
“Sappy” Stephen over a quarter of a century
ago, and has been inhabited by the Darleys (C -J )
for years past, was put up for sale last week.’ A-
rtfeh for the spoil occurred—mainly, it is confidently
averred, because the spoil is semi-vice-regal—but
buyers refused to estimate 'it at the vendor’s
figure. In the end the Sep Levys, .who
have had the Bruntons’ pretty place on Belle-
vue Hill while the rightful owners were abroad,
signed a lease of the old house for a term of eight
years.
Hr. Richard Arthur and Mrs. are overhauling
tlieir grips and considering their deck shoes with
a New to going to the bull’s-eye-of the Empire
next year. Their desirable house with the great
sea view at Mostnan’s is on the “To Be Let”
market.
Miss Pearl Faithful!, the subtly artistic'fancy
worker and the adoring friend of the imported
actress, and her sister, Mrs. Wilkinson, become
quite moneyed young parties by the death of their
father. The estate was proved at over £102,000,
which (except as to some York-street property)
is; to be equally divided between his two daughters.
Since the Goulds acquired knighthbod they
have been constantly bounding into the public
gaze hitting the public in the eve, so to speak
When knighthood is in floiver, it "often does put
springs on its heels. However, the latest jump is
in a good cause—the endowment of a cot at the
Royal Alexandra Hospital for Children. A meet-
ing held at the Gould mansion started the cot-
acquisition matter. The small bed will be known
as the “ Woollahra Cot.” Only £3O is required
and the Senatrix will find, by the time she.has pre-
sidented a great number of meetings for the Cot
object, and lavished afternoon tea and cookies upon
‘those present,” and burst several tyres in her
homicide cart (motor tyres cost £5 apiece) whilst
tooting about to collect shillings, and has spent
£J on stamping letters to those who were
‘‘ Present,” reminding them that they hadn’t sent
the promised half-crowns—by the time she has
done all these and other extravagances she will
find that it would have paid her to give her
cheque for. the £3O and be done with the matter.
Ihe Senator himself, it may be remarked, con-
tinues to wear calamitous ties and disastrous
tailorings.
Agent-General Coghlan is rejoicing over the
Stork’s last visit to his London home. The bird
brought him a son. It had already brought him
two daughters— two little Australians.
Mr. B. R, Wise has gone to Tasmania for the
law vacation. Later in this hot and vacant
season he will go as far as Perth (W. A.), but won’t
take root there.
The Thomas Hugheses have retired from the
mayoral rack, like a heretic who has sent in his
resignation to the Grand Inquisitor; and the
Allen Taylors have put themselves upon the
implement. An ornamental and mentally-culti-
vated pair are the Hugheses, and they filled their
billets with absolute satisfaction to'this city. As
for the lady, the way she toiled over the Women’s
Work Exhibition—the biggest job that con-
fronted any mayoress anywhere in recent
years—was heroic. She deserves to go through
the market place with twelve axe-bearers
waiting on her, six marching on each side—
that is, if she would like to be honored in that
old Roman fashion. No doubt the male half of
the Lordly Mayoralty was equally strenuous, but
it was Mrs. Hughes whom the feminine com-
munity kept under observation.
Our friends or acquaintances who went hence,
and incidentally visited the haunts of the beauty
doctor in London or Paris, return looking no more
beautiful than when they left. They may come
back in up-to-the-minute clothes and looking
smarter and possibly in better health, but they
bring back the same old bad complexions and
“lines” or brace of chins with which they went
away. Reports of the case in which a client sued a
London beauty doctor for damages done to her
facial area are to hand. One of the exhibits men-
tioned was an old woman, who played the part of
“splendid example.” She was supposed to be
“half done” in the process of rejuvenation. Half
her face’ was 30, the other half 70 years of age.
Explanation was that when the specimen was not
on view the rejuvenated half of the face was kept
in a medicated plaster. When this was pulled
off, the “ treated ” surface looked fresh and
plump for a little time. Then the lines and
hollows began to settle again until soon the young
half of the countenance matched the other old
half. : r - - ;
It is here—the Hat Tremendous ! Two Sydney
pretties, very Merrily Widowed in the fashion of
their hats, got into a tram-car awhile ago. But
they could not have entered without turning their
hats sideways. It was a humorous bit of strategy.
I once saw a cow trying to get rid of a 'sheet
of brown paper spitted on one horn, and
was reminded of it when those girls ducked their
heads and hats before taking a penn’orth, of
electric ride. Talking of hats, a Sydney milliner
tells me that for the last month she has been sell-
ing black Merry Widow hats with white roses.
There is no sale worth speaking of for any other
kind.
Some beautiful clothes for Miss Florence Young
to wear in “The Duchess of Dantzig” are in
course of development. The costumiere “de-
velops ” a frock now—she wouldn’t do anything
so commonplace as to make it. The Court gown
is of white satin charmeuse, with silver stole
decorations and short-waisted Empire bodice. A
Court train 3Jyds. long from the shoulders is the
eye-dazzler. It is of white brocade, with a pattern
of what looks like Nile lilies and long spear-like
foliage. The said pattern is outlined with
hundreds of thousands of silver spangles. A
grey frock, with two lines of military-like gold
braiding down the front, will be worn with
a Little Corporal brand of headgear; Also a pale
maize peignor, with long, straight embroidery
lines in many colors, will enhance the dress show.
A.s there is a little—a very little—disrobing in the
piece, some fairy-like lingerie with ribbons look-
ing coyly through the laces ought to be a fascinat-
ing detail.
It is wonderful how well Miss Maggie Moore
contrives to look and act the fourteen-year-
old schoolgirl. With her short frock, her
two Marguerite braids of flaxen hair, and her
pinny she might well look ridiculous, but
she doesn’t. It must take something like an
eighth of a mile of muslin to make her a pinny ;
but all the same, so long as you don’t look at her
through the lens, she might in appearance be one
of the Australian girl-women of 14 you run across
so frequently—more frequently in Melbourne
than in Sydney. Her playing, singing and laugh-
ing in the childish rble show artfully artistie
management of her resources. As for the audi-
ences, “ house full ” is the legend stuck up nightly
at the Palace.
Miss Eva O’Connor, the Sydney; “songer”(as
the bid Dutchman says in “Struck Oil”), who
went to England avihile ago, has had the luck to
impress the Randeggers with her capabilities of
voice, temperament and physique. A mutual
friend took the girl to the feminine Randegger
expert. After the first warble, the lady hurriedly
fetched the cavaliere himself. As a result, they
are training the damsel for grand Opera —a study
which she had no previous intention of taking up.
I endured one of the shocks of my life last week.
It was on a tram. All nature smiled. My fare
came to hand without an undue amount of search-
ing. The conductor was-affable. No one fell on
me, or trod on me, or opened a newspaper in my
face, or did any of the other things that are
chronic habits with tram-frequentfers. And yet,
,of a sudden, the light of day went out, as
it were. I became a broken and stupefied female.
In a word, Mr. Andrew Higginson clam-
bered aboard and took his seat opposite
me in mufti. I had hitherto only seen
this mime in the fascinating disguise of
Prince Danilo. As Danilo I blamed none for
loving him. Those large, dark and flashing eyes,
that chastely garbed figure, that face from which
at least .27 quarterings shone with 40 calcium-
power—verily the combination amounted to an
A. B,C. girl’s dream of masculine glory. I
squared my jaw and gazed again. , I saw a
dusty-looking person in the early ’thirties.
He.wore glasses. Behind the same were a pair of
faded eyes—the prominent strained-looking eyes
of the short-sighted subject. The brows were
not black and arched as Danilo’s are. Far
from it. I scanned the Higginson mouth.
Somehow it was not the Danilo mouth.
The shape was different. The tram voyager’s
clothes “fitted him too soon”; his boots
—of a rusty black—looked wrong; so did
his collar; likewise his hat. Faint and disillu-
sioned, I fled from the scene. Verily the
worshipper-from-afar of the beauty actor needs to
possess a pair of impermeable blinders for day-
light use; else her happy dream will vanish in
thin air.
The E. M. Woolley memorial has panned out
well, and some girl students qf the pianoforte will
have the benefit of the fund in a scholarship, which
will be maintained from a capital of nearly £l5OO.
The Associated Board came down handsomely
with £3OQ, and Mrs. MacArthur Onslow tipped in
£lOO. A women’s committee worked the miracle
—or the oracle.
Mr. J. E. Sykes has been lucky enough to secure
Ada Crossley and her co. for his concert on Christ-
mas night in the Town Hall. With such, hall-
marked goods the noted, accompanist with the
beflowered buttonhole ought to be able to cry
naught to the appalling rent he has to pay for the
premises. •
Margaret Anglin departs on. Saturday; She
re-opens her New York season about February
with “The Awakening of Helena Ritchie.”
According to an American paper, she will.-alter-
nate “ The Taming of the Shrew” with a Beau-
mont and Fletcher play-—a sequel to “The
Shrew,” in which.Petruchio is tamed by his wife,
the lady having relapsed into her old violent
ways.
Miss Thelma Hanlon, a fair, prettily-featured
girl of 17 or 18, is the latest light in the Sydney
soprano system.- The ■ light is so bright even at
this, her early student, stage that it gives every
promise of growing to first-star magnitude. Last
week, at the Y.M.C.A., supported by other pupils
of Signor Steffani, the young singer proved the
lyrical quality of her voice, in an attractive pro-
gramme. She has brains in her voice ; that fact
is proved on. overwhelming evidence.
Mr. Jack London’s proposed lecturing tour has
been cancelled owing to his continued ill-health.
After he and “ Mate ” have had a few weeks’ spell
in Tasmania they will return to their home 50
miles from ’Frisco. “ Mate ”is what London -
calls his wife, and when she sticks a bunch of
crimson rambler roses in her fair hair and bustles
about in a collarless print frock, she looks a very
adequate mate for London and his vessel, the
good marine pint-pot Snark.
Before the gangways of the Nimrod (the vessel
that has gone Antarctica-wards from M.L. to pick
up our Prof. David and others) were pulled up, a
proud mother took her infant on board and intro-
duced him as Nimrod Shackleton. Well, I once
knew twins named, respectively, Nimrod and
Ramrod.
Nevv York.has got the Salome habit virulently.
There are a dozen Salomes gliding and writhing
on as many stages in the hurried city. One of
them is La Sylphe, the dancer who was at
Rickards’ Tivoli not so long ago. She was the
only one of the lot who confessed to wearing
tights. The tights extended from shoulder to
ankle, with skirt of green gauze embroidered with
beetles and moons, bodice and girdle of emeralds
and other stones. Another Salome explained :
M.v costume is of blue gauze, embroidered in coral and
brilliants, the regulation girdle, and bodice of pearls.
However, I cover my ears with jewels, and that ought to
count for something. , ...
What an excess of modesty !
“ Mario ” writes from Brisbane :
Up to the beginning of the past week our Queensland
summer has been of a negative order. On Wednesday,
however, we got it right on the point of the jaw, and it
has continued that w'ay. It had a depressing effect upon
the Power-Buchanan marriage, which w-as accomplished
on the last lucky day, in St. Stephen’s Cathedral,
and at a temperature of 101°. The bride, the second and
prettiest sister of his Mayorship, nearly dissolved out of
her tulle yoke, while the plump little first citizeness
looked “fit to bust.” The guests, a particularly well-
draped lot, fried loudly during the event, while
the badly-behaved common or garden variety of on-
lookers boiled audibly. The bride made a bonnie
■picture, and her merry mads, adorned with
cream gowns and hats wreathed with Water lilies,
loaded with sheaves of the same blossom, and decked
with golden rings, were hot but triumphant. Mr. Frank
Logan and Dr. Page were deputed to look after the
groom, Geo. Perkins Power, son of' W. Power, M.L.C.,
deceased.
The heat has also forced the vice-regal clan to get a
move pn, and on Friday it retires in good order to Gabbin-
bar and seclusion. Lady Chelmsford is, meanwhile,
having a stir-up all round. She met the Pure Milk com-
mittee on Friday forenoon, and later, with ,her.hush.and,
handed over the Grammar School prizes, and in between .
she sandwiched a quarterly National Council of Women
foregathering-. - , .
I don’t know how things are with you, but it looks as
if our local young man were not up to sample. For I
hear upon good authority that a certain pair of pretty
damsels intend to found an Adamless Ede»-on a fair
Island in the Pacific, which they have already' leased
for 99 years. Even if there is no right of renewal, 99 years
ought to about see the experiment through 1 - There
are to be no knives or forks, no animal food, no clothes
save the simplest drapery—banana leaves, perhaps—no
letters, no hairpins—no nothing, in fact, to attract
flirts, and men for them to flirt with. Only- the leader
will ever leave the isle, and that once a year to set her
watch by the Sydney G.P.O. clock, and what she is to
come ashore in after about the fifth or sixth 'turn; the (
Lord alone'knows. 1
There is a story afloat touching a certain property,
belonging to the Sick Children’s Hospital. There is, it
appears, a doubt Upon the mind of the committee’'
v'hether a certain draft-beer emporium, from which a fat
rent accrues, shall be sold or retained. The personnel of
.the committee is mixed, and a Methody section denounces
the pub. with curses loud and long, while the brewing
push says : “Why worry? The rent is fat and paid to
date. Let her slide.”
His Ex. sauntered out, with Newton in tow, to watch
your light blue cricketers knock our maroon wickets
about in a shameful manner, at the cricket ground, on
Saturday. Even Roger Hartigan got “ shook out ”at 35,
and Redgrave dropped everything that came his way (in-
cluding his reputation as a pretty field).
Ex-Premier Philp was the receiver of a big consignment
of hardware f ropi members of his own party at Parliament
House ,on Friday? A silver tea and coffee set, heavy
enough to slay a burglar with, if thrown hard enough and
straight enough at the right part of the burglar (and pro-
vided the burglar didn’t dodgfe), a three-fold address, and
a case of toilet silver for,Mrs. Philp were in the lot.
William Kidston is finding the she-electors a snag.
The various men-leagues of his party have accepted the
new order of things, but the women decline to commit
themselves and stand in frosty isolation. But William
most likely won’t last to see the fray.
Yours Affectionately,
AKENEHI.

HONOUR WHERE HONOUR IS DUE.

Dentifrice, the preserver of dental beauty, and preventive of dental decay. . . ■
Winter-Time.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
In the vast congeries of people such as populate
London, with its ever-present undercurrent of active
crime and passive want, you cannot play with fire
without danger of a conflagration. We are as yet only on
the skirts of winter-time. Scotland Yard is looking
forward uneasily to what may happen in the metropolis
during its rigorous depths. . ,
Velvet will be in great favor this winter, and, in
company with fur, will be at its best. They are making
very narrow sets of ermine and square, flat muffs of this
regal fur. Royal blue velvet is also much used on grey fur
toques. The opossum and chinchilla both look well with a
touch of deep rich blue. Large hats are trimmed with
fur just as much as toques ; in fact, I tremble when I con-
sider what hats of this type will cost, for they require
almost as much sable as would suffice for a stole. Cheek-
by-jowl extracts from S. M. Herald's English letters.
In England, Merrie England, the winter has
begun ;
The giants, Fog and Frost, now have swallowed
up the sun ;
The days are short and gloomy, the nights are
cold and long,
How fare the English people — sonic forty millions
strong ?
In England, Merrie England, the rich folk feast
and play ;
They’re looking forward gladly to merry Christ-
mas Hay !
Bed gleam the holly-berries underneath the snow
and rime—
A fair, white land is England on the skirts of
winter-time.
In England, Merrie England, the people make
good cheer
With turkey and plum-pudding, and mince-pies,
wine and beer,
There’s church on Christmas morning—next night
the pantomime—
A merry land is England on the skirts Of winter-
time !
In England, Merrie England, this is the time for
jokes ;
The women wear blue velvet upon their grey, fur
toques —
And some are furred with sable, and look almost
sublime —
In England they wear ermine on the skirts of
winter-time ?
The frosty days are bracing for whoso rides or
. skates,
They stop the hunts and racing, but then there
are the Waits —
The Christmas-trees and parties ; the sledge-bells’
merry chime,
The fireside fun and frolics on the skirts of
winter-time.
In England, Merrie England, the poor folk hunt
for bread,
In vain !—to other countries their work and wage
are fled—
They starve in gloomy silence amid the filth and
slime;
’Tis ever so in England on the skirts of winter-
time !
In England, Merrie England, the pauper legions
swell —
Her patient, workless millions go daily down to
Hell !
In rags, and fed on crusts, amid debauchery and
crime,
Swarm little, wolfish children on the skirts of
winter-time !
In England, Merrie England, the Mistress of the
Seas,
The advent of the winter time brings in such
miseries,
That one might almost say that Hope had sought
another clime —
That Cod departs from England on the skirts of
winter-time !
In England, Merrie England, the winter has begun —
How many English folk shall starve before its course
be run ?
How many brave, devoted souls shall perish ere their
prime,
While Fashion fi.<iunts in velvet on the skirts of
winter-time ?■

O. C. CABOT.
Insurance, Taxes and Humbug.
The old trouble regarding the alleged iniquity
of taxing the profits of life assurance offices has
been raised again in the S. Australian Assembly,
where the income-tax law is being altered-.- Upon
this subject of the “poor man’s savings, the pro-
vision for the widow and the orphan, the
“ penalising of thrift,” etc., a tremendous amount
of cant has been talked. The insurance policy is
merely a form of investment. It is a desirable
form ; but there are dozens of other desirable
forms. The man who says “ I will invest some-
thing and at the same time try to give a lift to my
country,” and accordingly puts a bit into some
new industrial concern is, from the national point
of view, at any rate, more worthy of an
approving pat on the shoulder than the other man
who merely takes out an insurance policy and
doesn’t care two wormy figs what the office does
with the money. The life assurance office isn’t a
benevolent or philanthropic institution ; it is an
investment machine, pure and simple—if possible,
it is becoming more and more of an investment
machine every year of its life. The average man
hasn’t got , time to follqw the history of invest-
ments ; he isn’t in the way of finding out what is
safe and what isn’t ; and investments don’t come
knocking at his door. The insurance office is, or
is supposed to be, an expert in these matters,
and, since it is known to be always seek-
ing investments, those who have them to
offer take them to the office. But they don’t
take the industrial investment, because they
know that, no matter how much the investment
might benefit the country, the insurance office
Wouldn’t look at that sort of thing, because
it never knows when the Freetrade party
might knock out the security. While, there-
fore, the man who wants to put something by
relieves himself of the trouble of investment, his
money is, on the whole, not doing as much for the
country as if he kept its disposal in his own hands.
This is no argument whatever against life
assurance ; for, as a matter of fact, since the office
guarantees the return of the money, the office
can’t afford to look at anything but the big, solid,
proved, established thing. While, however,
it is no argument against life assurance, it
is a very sizeable one against giving that
class of investment machine special exemp-
tions from taxation. And there is another
reason why it shouldn’t have special exemptions
from taxation. The assurance office, as remarked
just now, isn’t a benevolent society. Let a physi-
cally unfit person try to get a policy, and he will
find that out promptly. His physical unfitness
may be his misfortune and not his fault; but that
makes no difference to the office—it won’t have
him. The fit can invest that way ; the unfit can’t.
Therefore the unfit have to invest some other way.
Hence the claim to exempt the profits of life
assurance offices boils down to a proposal that the
physically and mentally fit of thecommunity should
be specially relieved of taxation, while the
halt, the lame, the spavined and the blind should
make up the deficiency by something extra in the
way of taxation ; for, of course, if those who are
best able to pay taxes escape them, those who are
least able to pay have to provide a double share.
The community when it got hold of life assurance
got hold of a wonderfully good thing; and to help
it along it fell into the habit of talking a lot of
humbug about the matter. But when some of that
humbug is used as a pretext for dodging taxation,
it becomes time to thrust a hatpin into the bubble
of cant.
“A Leaven of Gentle Indian.”
Dear Bulletin,—
Lo, the poor Indian, whose untutoredmind andfatalistic
indifference to human life lightly turn him to murderous
outrage on any or no provocation, leavens Fiji even more
considerably than your statistics indicate (B. 13/8/’08.).
But the alien importations increase so rapidly that it is
impossible to keep right up to date in their re-
spect. However, even three years ago the Fijians were
many fewer, the Hindus considerably more numerous
than as totalled by your figures, which are approximately
those of the census of 1901—quite “ old times ” in modern
Fiji. In 1901 there were 91,000 natives and 17,000 coolies.
In the Government-issued “ Handbook to Fiji,” 1905, the
native population of the islands is given as 86,816, and
the number of Indians as 25,952. I am told that there are
now well over 40,000 of the latter, and the Fijians, if con-
tinuing their average yearly decrease, as I believe they
are, can hardly amount to more than 80,000 souls. Less
than half-a-century ago there were 200,000 of them !
Here we have clearly a dying race, which bids fair to be
extinct within the time of many people who are now
living. A recent Governor once waxed enthusiastic
over the golden future which, he said, was waiting for
Fiji. That may be, but no prophet is needed to predict
that it will not be a future for Fijians. Nor for
the white man, either, if present appearances and past
statistics mean anything. Consider some records. In
1891 the European population of the group was only
four-sevenths of what it had been in 1884. In 1897 it
amounted to 3292 (males 2065, females 1227), and in 1905
—in spite of the large number of whites to whom the
ever-increasing operations of the mammoth Colonial
Sugar Refining Company give employment—it had
dropped to 2675 (males 1607, females 1068). And the
time-expired Hindu “indentured laborer,” the “free
Indian,” never dreams of returning to his own hungry
country. He is a British subject, with the right, which
he always exercises,- to stay on in a British.place, which
he seems to find greatly to his liking. So he is becoming
a planter hiniself on a quickly-growing scale, and, by
dint of merciless under-selling, has already practically
“ burst up ” all the small European tradesfolk. He.
acquires their businesses, and promises to make Queer-
street. the address of the bigger traders, also, in the not
very distant by-arid-bye. For a rice-eating, “ pig-anyhow”
Pagan flourishes happily under conditions which cause the
higli-standarded champion of Christendom to collapse
miserably. ' : <
Yet, insists the fatuous “ Handbook to Fiji, ’’(Govern-
ment-compiled), “ labor is cheap, with none qf those-
dangers and anxieties which affect employers in many
other parts of the world ! ” Ye gods !' Look at the- July
criminal list, as quoted by Tim Bulletin. And that is,
comparatively, a ! niild Specimen of what is often almost
inconceivable. As for. the odious, comparison, the most
that an unpopular employer need fear, in the white man’s
country, is an open strike on the part of his workers. In
Fiji, the “mild Hindu” lies low till, catching*. the,
offence-giving-boss alone, unarmed and, for choice-, in the-
dark, he chops him up with a cane-kmfe. Only the other
day a young Queenslander, in the C. 8. It. Company’s
employ, Hall by name, was called out at nigpt;, to “ sf q
somebody,” by an Indian servant. As he, rounded a
corner, in black darkness, be was attacked by sotne 1 16
coolies, armed with large cane-knives, and literally cut to
pieces. No one knows in what be had offended. But I
wonder what the poor youth thought about . “ nom
dangerous cheap labor ” as its first knife cut into him !
TALAFEEAU.
Shut out from the foreign cheap-lkbor markets by
the tariff, the Calico JlMMiks who handle clothes

“ Hoe! But Ai'rn not holding with you thcyarr!

etc., etc.
the white workers and factory hands to be
sweated. In Victoria there are Wages Boards,
and decent working conditions have been estab-
lished ; but in Queensland practically nothing has
been done in that way yet, owing to the obstruc-
tion of the House of Fat. Therefore Melbourne
importers and wholesale rag merchants are pass-
ing on orders .to Brisbane, where shirts, for
example, are being made for 7s. a dozen, while
under the decent Victorian conditions they cannot
be produced for less than 10s. More than that, the
people who are making the shirts in Brisbane
for 7s. are paying freight both ways (the Mel-
bourne importer supplies the material), and in
some cases the Brisbane makers are actually
also throwing the buttons in. Thus the
trade is drifting away from a State in
which Wages Boards see that decent living
conditions are observed, and is flowing to a
place where sweating of the most injurious sort is
practised—the sweating of girls and young women.
The circumstance illustrates over again the abso-
lute necessity of putting industrial legislation
under the same authority that controls the Cus-
toms. It is bad enough to buy sweated goods.
It is even worse to buy sweated goods
when the sweating is done by our own people.
The purpose of Protection is to secure for the
people decent living conditions ; and, with inter-
State Freetrade, it is obvious that that purpose
can be defeated if one State chooses to tolerate
sweating conditions. It is not a bit of use
■ going round carefully at nights locking the outer
doors and seeing that the windows are all fastened,
if the burglar is inside all the time.
“ Quetta,” on telegraphic delays
In connection with the frequent delay to the public
telegrams, there is one point that should not be over-
looked by the Royal Commission. That point is the time
occupied during- the day iri handling press matter.
If the public had any idea of how often its business is
hung up while press messages are ordered by a ser'vile (so-
called) authority to be given precedence, it would very
soon want to know the reason why.
Press rates, owing to the subservience of Ministers and
. Parliament, are so absurdly cheap that it is scarcely worth
. while; bothering to occupy the clerks’ time in checking
the messages. In this way the press is subsidised to the
extent of an enormous sum by the public service.
1 The rates are so cheap that press matter is now sent
practically as it appears in print, instead of, as formerly,
being condensed for telegraphing-and then filled in by the.
paper when received.
For this reason the daily papers can dispense with a
number.of men, and so again save at the public expense,
i Also for j;he same reason these papers every week receive
thousands of words rd country poultry shows, detailing
, liow Mr. JoneS’ black Leghorn duck beat Mrs. Smith’s
silver-Pekln houdan, etc. ;
In these ways the press,is directly .subsidised at the
’ expense of the public purse and convenience. And yet
after years of experience one really never quite fathoms
the “cheek” of‘these’ journals that, battening on the
people in .this way (as well aS others), never cease to use
the large expense of running Government- railways, posts
and telegraphs, etc., as an argument that “Socialism”
would end, in financial dieter. They intimidate Govern-
ments- into giving them concessions, and. ( then use the
result to'bamboozle the silly public that pays e'very time.
To illustrate this: For “ oidiiiary "press news one scale
is charged (as stated, ridiculously cheap), but now that
the telegraphs are- under; the Oommbnwe'alth any press
matter concerning “Federal” questions is still further
' reduced.
And then in face of this you have half-a-d'ozen respon-
sible officials jostling each other to show 1 their-zeal,in
setting aside heaps of “ ordinary ’’ telegrams(paid for at
full rates)for longer or shorter periods-, while “press”
for the BgM,iiLEDQM Advertiser,is rushed through,to be in
time. . ■
Perhaps The Bulletin will permit an opportunity of
throwing a little light on a subject of public interest in
case Hume Oook, Webster and co. might feel shy on this
aspect of the case.

Under the heading “An Australian Mechanic
Abroad ” one “ G.11.M.” contributed an article to
the S. M. Herald (28/11/’08) on the labor condi-
tions in various countries he visited while ex-
perience-hunting during the past 5£ years. At
the time he left Sydney, then already cursed by
the Federal Protectionist tariff, he said
Wages paid were £3 per week of 48 hours, and comfort-
able board was obtainable for 18s. per week. There was
no difficulty in securing good employment, and clothing,
etc., was cheap.
He went to Maoriland, another victim of the tariff
blight. He wrote
After spending a few days looking round Wellington, I
secured employment in a large factory, the wages being
£3 ss. per week of 46 hours. ... After some nine months’
working in the Windy City, I proceeded to Christchurch,
the beautiful City of the Plains, where I was engaged, the
wages being from £3 to £3 sc. per week of 44 hours.
And, finally, he sampled Auckland :
The wages were £3 per week of 46 hours.
Crossing over to Protectionist Canada :
I quickly obtained work at £4 per week of 48 hours,
and comfortable lodgings at £1 ss.
He tried San Francisco
Wages were high, cabinetmakers receiving £5 12s. 6d.
per week of 48 hours—eight hours each day, Saturday in-
cluded. Shop hands worked 44 hours only. Fairly good
board was to be obtained at from 255. to 30s. per week.
Later he drifted to Gotham, of which he spoke
thus
In New York I was fortunate enough, after three
weeks’ waiting, to obtain work at £4 10s. per week of 48
hours. Living I found to be fairly reasonable, and cloth-
ing of middle quality moderately cheap.
And then a day came when he shipped for
Merry England, where Freetrade is alleged, by
papers of the Herald’s stamp, to make the lot of
the worker a heavenly one. Here is the sort of
Paradise he struck :
In London I found things industrially in a bad way ;
work was vt-rv hard to get, and then only at small wages.
On applying for a billet advertised in one of the daily
papers I was surprised to find about 1000 men waiting, and
only 10 were required. Eventually, after some weeks’
waiting, I obtained work at £llss. per week of 50 hours,
and board with homely folks at 16s. per -week. Clothes
were cheap, but the margin between income and outgo
was but small. After five months’ working in London,
our shop was compelled to close for want of orders.
It is hard to conceive a more crushing rebuttal of
the fiscal theories the S. M. Herald propounds
in its leading columns than the plain narrative of
this plain-spoken contributor. But presumably
the paper will goon mourning about the “ Curse of
Protection ” as of yore.

MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, December 14, 1908.
My Dear Yarrik, —
Melbourne society is in the agitated state of
packing for the hoped-for coolness of the moun-
tain boarding-house, or for the Hades-like seaside
hotel; and in the intervals of jumping on fat luggage
it drags pampered offspring, with short skirts and
long, naked limbs, round the shops and heated
pavements of “town.” The naked-limbed P. 0-
spring has its fill of “town” this festive time of
the year, and the busy business man who is trying
to make possible three days’ holidays by three
weeks of extra-hard work, is full up of the pampered
and naked-limbed offspring (1) because he falls
over her in the streets, and (2) because he
has to flee like a bolting horse over the
earth’s crust buying her Christmas presents.
The Governor-General Countess has headed the
outgoing push by departing for Moss Vale, in your
State. The Carmichaels are having their turn of
the Macedon humpy. Before they left, their
informal Excellencies broke one of the statutes of
the Medes and Persians by giving a garden party
in the dog season. Not that an iced and shady
garden party is out of place in the heat, but
Custom has decreed that after the fitful fever of
Cup-time cometh Rest. Nevertheless, the Car-
michaels love informal frivols, and St. Andrew’s
Day caused their Hielan’ blood to riot sedately.
They waved their arms in his honor and beat the
cymbals. The skirl of bagpipes enfolded the
gardens of Stonington like the weird tentacles of
an octopus, and the guests in chief wore heather
in their buttonholes and said “ Weel” and “Ye
ken. ” Therefore was the soul of the departed saint
blessed.
Dudley evidently aspires to be taken seriously
as a sport. There is nothing he bucks at. He
can ride anything, can race a yacht, goes to play
cricket just for ordinary practice several times a
week, and now his Upper Excellency (the State
Govs, ate Lower Excellencies) is interested in the
rifle clubs. He is positively dying to pot a baby
bear at a couple of yards. Every rifle club inclines
its heart to this affable and interested lord. How
long will it last? Even a Governor must want
some time to rest under the shade of a tree, or to
enjoy a quite smoke in his own den.
Governor Carmichael says that what strikes
him more than anything else as he wanders round
this land of the ’roo, is its extreme newness ;
everything is so fresh and spick and span. Once
only did he strike something that had an appear-
ance of eld—that was St. Paul’s Cathedral. Even
then, he whimsically added, the man who was
doing the honors became apologetic. “This
cathedral was built some considerable time ago,
your Excellency, and it’s rather out of date. Of
course, if we were building afresh, we’d have
something more up to the moment ! ” And yet
the average sinner seems to think that age is the
only excuse for the costly magnificence of cathe-
drals in general.
At the Arts and Crafts Exhibition two young
men —one Swanson and his friend Finlay—have
cast serious reflections on the idiocy of the methods
of the Importer. They have taken our own clay-
just lumps of Australia—and with a rough potter’s
wheel, fashioned from a worked-out cart-wheel,
have made pots and pottery of good and sound
design, with coloring of excellent artistic merit.
Given such results with economical roughness
and primitive machinery, what brilliancy coujd
come from well-established factories ! It brings
up the point also that similar lumps of Australia-
great big lumps of white clay—are being exported
constantly to Germany. Germany chuckles over
this fine china clay, makes it into pottery, and
sells it back to the simple Australian at great
profit. When will he be wise and, like Swanson
and Finlay, make his own mud pies?
All round and about the Arts and Crafts is the
joyous trail of the gumleaf design. The taper
fingers of the gumleaves scarred against a blue
sky—trembling, for ever weirdly trembling—get
into the Australian’s blood. The design, even
without its fascinations of color, is full of mystic
suggestion. Mrs. Poster-Blamire-Young has gum-
leaves carved into a fine overmantel that would
make any Australian exile homesick. Mrs.
George Box, a leading spirit in the Exhibition
movement, has put gumleaves into a carpet. The
whole border design is of gumleaves waving
against a blue-green background.
Stockfeld, a young Melbourne artist who evolves
furniture designs from his innermost soul and
fashions the wood with his hands, has an exhibit
in the Arts and Crafts Exhibition that
makes one feel quite satisfied to forego
the dubious joys and cheapness of Japanese
and Chinese ant-eaten sticks. There are
chairs that hold their soft arms open like enticing
sirens, and are a dream of rest to a tired body.
The designs are simple; catalogues call them
“ chaste,”but the simplicity of their naked leather
form is decidedly alluring. There is a screen de-
signed by Stockfeld and worked by Miss Riggall
that would turn a dreamy man into a poet in one
sitting. It is brown leather with green lizards
and dark bats, and has already been annexed by
some wise and fortunate person.
Savant de Possel, the boss manager man for
the Australian end of the Messageries Maritimes,
is being transferred from Melbourne to Sydney.
This tall, gaunt, elegant personage is a connoisseur
in wines, and he packs up with a breaking heart,
because he thinks of the transference of his cellar,
and the moving and shaking up and possible break-
age of dozens of sets of choice vintages that lie
cosily in their shrouds of spider-web. The learned
Frenchman is an epicure of the most fastidious
degree, and can comfortably spend an hour in
explaining the right way to boil an artichoke. He
can boil an artichoke in seven different languages
—oven unto Arabic, and the gentleman’s Arabic is
of a sheen more polished than even his French and
English. The de Possel son and heir will leave a
gallant gap in the ranks of eligibles. The son is
a fair youth of social grace, aijfl a pillar in the
younger section of the Alliance "Francaise.
Collins-street—the medical end of it—is going
off in one big bang to the South Seas and the land
of the Brown Girl. Congress seems to have made
medicoes most fraternal. A Union boat takes a
jolly crowd of them away for a fortnight’s cruise.
They sail on New Year’s Day. Eye and Ear
Barrett is the Napoleon of the party, and Doctor
“Bill” Aitken goes along to study the Brown
Girl’s teeth and the reasons thereof.
A youth of this city chose a subtle way of dis-
solving a matrimonial promise which began to tax
him. The “engagement” was somewhat sub
rosa, as the sweet girl lived on a lower social
plane than the youth’s imperious folks. After some
years of this surreptitious devotion, the languid
young man found the matter a bore. He was
much too tender-hearted to smash the promise
with a village blacksmith’s hammer, so he selected
the delicate method of mentioning in repeated
staccato to his “nice’’girl friends on the Block
and around the golf links and at gaudy receptions:
‘ ‘ Oh, yes; there was a kind of engagement,
don’t-y’-know, but I think it’s goin’ to be broken
off—haw, yaas.” The “method” is having its.
delicately insinuating effect upon the girl. She
feels her engagement fading and yet she hardly
knows how it fades.
It is rumored awesomely that the latest adorer
of Melbourne’s most original and gorgeously-
dressed damsel is a personage in disguise. He is
one of those whom a dizzy social elevation impels
to travel incognito. He had originally some sport
or business purpose in view in visiting these
shores, but it vanished in thin air nor left a
wrack behind the moment he struck the over-
whelming young person who leads the van in
female garniture hereabouts. Meanwhile, scores
of fair Government Housers are gnashing their
teeth, and murmuring the society-equivalent
for “Whaffor?” Their invariably successful
rival is nothing out of the way in the matter of
facial beauty. Her figure is perfect; but there
are others whom Providence and physical
culture have made as good. Intellectually, she
has never shown any indication of being a George
Sand. Why, therefore, does every ultra-desirable
male with nothing to do but lean up against the
gold-dust at jewellery establishments and soft-
goods emporiums fall at her feet and worship at
the first encouraging nod ? It is a problem as
maddening as it is insoluble.
Henry Skinner, of food fame, and his lady
invite a vast crowd to South Melbourne Town
Hall, where there is to be a musical and variety
show(supper taken for granted) in honor of various
local sports teams, particularly the cadets who
won the Sargood Shield. The function, shivoo,
or blow-out is for the 22nd.
The Charlie Taits departed on the Bremen for
a jaunt to Germany, and afterwards to the Bull-
Fog Country where the unemployed are. The
Bremen took the vanquished ’Murkan tennis
players on the home track. They were good
sports, these men, and they lost gracefully.
Nevertheless, they departed breathing vengeful
vows of another battle for the Davis Cup. The
gilded understudies, Reggio and Wagner, also
departed with their tight-waisted coats and the
glory of their bag pants and tie shoes. The
Bremen carried much glory, for on it went also
Hambourg, the Hairy One, with his tall wife and
small baby Sonia. Sonia intends to.yell her sing-
ing voice into form during the voyage.
Beatrice Day, starring with Julius Knight, has
had a chequered career in Australia. Her most
recent shining was cut short by the tragically-
sudden death of poor old actor-manager Flem-
ming. Twice before in Melbourne the Beatrice
Day-Flemming production was eaten away at the
roots by the worm of ill-luck. Once it was the
illness (heat apoplexy) of Flemming and an over-
powering heat wave in the city. Another time
it was the railway strike. People deserted
the theatres wholesale, and Flemming’s
show shared the fate of the others. Miss Day’s
first appearance in Melbourne was with the
Broughs, and as “second lead” the light and
radiance of her glory was somewhat bushelled by
the overwhelming popularity of the first lady.
Nevertheless Beatrice Day’s creation of the part
of Susan in “ Quality-street,” a part full of humor-
ous pathos, stands out as clear as a diamond.
The stage was not Miss Day’s first profession.
She trained as a nurse ; in fact, she has her
diploma and everything necessary to qualify her
to take charge of a serious case at a moment’s
notice. A brother-in-law is a prominent medico
in London—Dr. Mapleson, son of that Colonel
Maplesqn who was so renowned for his managerial
work with famous opera combinations.
The court scene in the present production of
“The Prisoner of Zenda” brings back memories
of the social importance attached to its earliest
production here—in the days when Julius
Superbus was a younger and alluringly leggy
man. Mrs. Maesmore Morris, of beauteous fame,
made her first stage appearance “ walking on ” at
the Court reception. Her fat, dark foil of a
friend, Miss Edith Sutton—a society maiden—
stumbled on alongside of her. This girl, I re-
member, turned and bowed as graciously as the
prima donna at a handful of applause bestowed
by her “set” from the stalls. Another society
beauty among the “ walking ons” was Thistle
Anderson, an Adelaide girl, now married to a
wealthy one named Fisher. This young lady
tumbled headlong over her train one night, as a
result of stage fright or something. At that first
production, highways (most elevated ways.' in
fact) and byways were beaten for recruits for the
splendiferous Court scene. The management
even made humble approaches to the beautiful
damsels who draw snaky wealths of trains after
their superb and hawty selves in the showrooms
of the mighty chiffon stores, but they tilted
their noses and refused. The trouble with
the management was to get girls capable of
progressing favorably across a stage stretch
in advance of a train. In grandmama’s day
—and even more recently—the young of the
female sex were taught to handle a great mass
of following drapery, as a fashionable young
monkey might have been prompted in the most
elegant manner of drawing its tail in curves.
In fact, the high rank of a sliemale as she grew up
—the hall mark of the perfect lady—was the apt
way in which she whipped up her tail and slung
its several yards of unnecessary volume over her
arm. The train is a most graceful appendage,
certainly, and pleasing as it rustles over a lawn or
a carefully carpeted floor, but it might well be
abandoned for everyday wear. Its chief use is to
gather a following of germs, dead leaves, and the
bones that Fido has abandoned.
Miss Laing-Meason, a Maoriland society
maiden of much lineage, walks on in the present
“ Prisoner of Zenda ” Court scene, and displays
her Vere de Vere features to the Gussies and
chappies of the stalls. “The Prisoner” has
always lent itself to this particular development
of society vanity.
Why do elderly gentlemen in exalted posi-
tions invite the breath of calumny by conferring
periodical cheques upon youngish ladies uncon-
nected with the family? When the elderly
gentlemen are married, too ! One of Melbourne’s
most shining pillars of respectability has a lady
oensioner whose remittance is always a slip of
printed paper with his name in the right-hand
bottom corner of it. She can’t cash it in the dark,
so to speak, and in the fierce light that beats
upon a periodical payment the man who draws
the cheque draws attention to both himself
and the receiver. The piece of paper becomes a
recognised bond of sympathy.
From “ Rosna,” of Adelaide :
We’re going to have an Admiral for a Governor, too !
His name is Sir Day Hort Bosanquet. We couldn’t put
up with less, seeing that our electric trams are nearly'
ready to run. According to the scanty information to
hand, he will bring two cocked hats (one for week days,
t’other for Sundays ; also possibly a second-hand cocked
hat to go fishing in), a dozen swords and one charm-
ing wife. Instead of going back to Britain, as he had
intended, Mr. Baillie-Hamilton will stay on to aide the
new Excellency and give him points about the tempers
and customs of the wild inhabitants of Adelaide.
Our present Exes, leave on December 31, and are going
next to govern Trinidad and Tobago. The Le Huntes are
not at all stuck up about it, but say frankly that they’ve
got to govern something for their chop and milk. His
Ex. couldn’t do without his milk.
We’ve lent a house and home to the Dudleys for the
summer ; they are to come in January and camp in our
Hills for two months. Marble Hill is being turned inside
out and head over heels in preparation, and as it isn’t
large enough to house the whole Dudley menage , the
Richard Chaffey Bakers’ bungalow near by has been bor-
rowed to make a vice-regal nursery, and to house the
Eord High Candlestick in Waiting, and afford a shake-
down to the Chief Feather Duster.
Fierce excitement! The first electric car has been
running. It slithered up and down North Terrace, the
other day, with a long tail of enthusiasts streaming after
it, although the temperature was high, and it wasn’t a
day when the leading citizen could stream in comfort,
though he streamed with perspiration all right. The
cars have not started as a regular thing yet, however.
This one was just showing us what it could do at apinch.
Half the lines aren’t ready yet, and if one suburb had its
cars before the others there would be another Balkan
rising in these parts.
The ’Varsity undergads had their annual lunatic frivols
qn Wednesday. They captured a squad of ancient mokes,
painted them red, white and blue, and proceshed all
over town. Then they went down to the Jubilee Oval,
followed by a big frilly crowd, and achieved a fancy dress
cricket match, some hurdle races (in which the hurdles
were quite three inches high), and a fearful and wonder-
ful balloon ascent.
People returning from the Fog whisper that the cattle
monarch Kidman has captured two motor cars and a
titled relative, and intends to bring them all back with
him. The Duke, or whatever he is, is a very distant
relative ; and that’s, no doubt, why the cattle-man had to
buy two motor cars. No relative is so distant that you
can’t reach him with two swift cars—especially if you
don’t always want to use the biggest and swiftest car
yourself.
For the Conservatoire’s breaking-up party the boys and
girls achieved a toy symphony. It was hilarious. There
were eight fiddles and a ’cello, and the call of bird, the
roar of beast, and the buzz of insect were imitated on toy
instruments. It mightn’t have been high art, but it was
good fun.
Canon Pollitt, who retired from the shepherding and
vineyard business three or four years ago, has just died.
When he was much younger he married a Miss Carlton,
daughter of her who wrote us our “Song of Australia”—
the one every school kiddy in S. Aus. knows by heart.
The British Nurses’ Association has a home and a pretty
old garden, and it dolled them both up and laid on ices
and strawberries, and had a farewell garden party to Lady
Le Hunte. The. garden also wore a string band and a
gypsy fortune-fakir, who warned you to beware of a
tram accident and a dark woman, and told you not to be
struck by lightning on a Friday. All the nurses were
white-uniformed, and, besides the Governoress and Miss
Clowes, there was a little crowd of frilly laity present.
Adelaide summer weather has received a big and unex-
pected testimonial in the taking over of Marble Hill, the
local vice-regal out-of-town residence, by the Governor-
General for several months after Christmas. The popular
tendency is to flee from Adelaide in summer. But—quite
apart from the fact that S.A. heat is usually so dry as to
hurt nobody, and not to interfere even with cricket or
tennis—Adelaide has really two climates, that of the city
on the plain, where orange, olive and vine ripen, and that
of the hills just behind, which grow strawberry, cherry
and apple. And the distance from the G.P.O. to the hill-
top is, at the outside, eight or nine miles.
Yours affectionately,
JOHANNA.
N.S.W. elects regularly six Senators who
are all Freetraders in theory, all strong advocates
in theory of Free Competition, all strongly opposed
in theory to Protective duties and bonuses, aud
all powerful State-Frighters and much worried
about the alleged designs of its neighbors on the
Ma State’s purse. And it was beautiful to see
these six vote as one fraud for the taxing of Vic-
toria and S.A. and Queensland and the other
States in order to pay large bonuses to the
N.S.W. iron industry. The Victorians also voted
to tax themselves in order to pay bonuses to the
N.S.W. iron industry, but as Protectionists their
attitude was logical. That of the six Foreign-
trade frauds wasn’t.
The slaying of Hannah Kelly in a h otel at
Armidale (N.S.W.) was the sort of episode on
which Miss Braddon loved to build her romances.
Hannah, a waitress aged 30, went to bed in the
same room with a fellow servant, Agnes O’Leary.
About 4 a.m. Hannah’s throat was cut with
a weapon which seems to have disappeared.
Agnes O’Leary says that she awoke to find a man
in the room and bending over Hannah; that
he took alarm and fled by the win-
dow ; and that she then discovered Hannah,
as she thought, to have broken a blood-
vessel, and accordingly roused the house. The
strong arm of the law has arrested Agnes O’Leary
as the nearest and handiest person, and it is
inquiring after any possible man who looks like the
sort of man who might naturally have gone
through a window. The fact that the dust on the
window sill was not disturbed suggests the advisa-
bility of looking for a very active man with
a long-jumping capacity. Also it might be
well to search everywhere for a well-thumbed
copy of a recent newspaper containing an
account of how, a few weeks ago, Miss Huffy, of
Carpentaria Downs (Q.), had her throat cut
mysteriously in the night. That paper is assuredly
lying around somewhere, and the finger prints on
it might be valuable for purposes of comparison.
“N.": The name of Ralston in “ Jini the Penman ” was
taken from the actual Ralston, of San Francisco. He was
not a forger or embezzler, and could hardly be called a
defaulter ; but he made a noise in the world through the
breakdown of the Bank of California, of which he was
manager. Hundreds of families were ruined. Ralston
went for a long swim in San Francisco Bay, and lost
himself in the far-off rollers of the Pacific.

“O.” : Most Parliaments that have tried to say
what adulteration is have failed wretchedly, so the
United States Government has lately gone on a new tack,
and prescribed as follows :
A food product will be deemed to be adulterated —
(a) If any valuable ingredient naturally present
therein has been extracted.
(b) If any less valuable ingredient has been substituted
therefor.
(c) If it be colored, powdered, or polished with intent
to deceive, or to make the article appear of a better
quality than it really is.
( d ) If it be a substitute or imitation of a genuine
article offered under the name of that article.
The definition, as a definition, could hardly be worse.
Much of it is not about adulteration at all. But that is
just where its merit as a thief-catcher lies, and from the
accounts to hand it seems to have paralysed commercial
bandits who braved scores of more accurately-drawn
definitions.

“ Periwinkle ” : Of all the nuisances with which
this great land is accursed, the half-beery toiler who
speculates 3s. 9d. in a watch, with-chain thrown in, takes
the roast black duck every time. After trying the
patience of the horological expert to “ chucking-out ”
tension, Billjim produces a half-sovereign and pockets his
timepiece, after telling the fuming trader about all the
watches that had been in the Billjim family since the year
two. He takes 45 minutes in counting his change,
and gets sorely befogged over the odd three-
penny-bit, which he always reckons as beer-money.
Then he compares his ticker with the trader’s timepiece
and inquires, for the 69th time, if that is the correct
time. Being answered in the affirmative, Billjim holds
his new acquisition to his ear and listens for a space of 6f
minutes to make sure it has a good tick. Later on he
leaves with the parting admonition that if the watch (on
which the profit is 3£d.) doesn’t give satisfaction he will
have the seller’s gore. Before closing time Billjim
has paid eight visits to compare his treasure and
the trader’s timepiece, being more befuddled on each
occasion. Next day, when the horologist is at the
post-office registering a packet or two for Ins
clients, he is accosted by Billjim, who earnestly wants
to know' the time—holding forth his three-and-nine-
pennv purchase for all the world to see. While the
cheque lasts the watchmaker is pestered with his
patron. In the end a sick and sorry Billjim is found
waiting on the shop doorstep on the fifth morning—
rarely later —to plead for the advance of the price of a
drink on his timepiece, w'hich has been the object of
many a beery argument, and the victim of some queer
vicissitudes. Verily Billjim and his new watch are a
burden.
“ W.K.” : Crooks run in many guises, but the
coolest that ever stayed in my hotel was a fellow aged
about 22, who might have been anything from a well-
mannered commercial drummer to the private secretary
of a Minister. Although he wore a fancy flowered silk
vest there was nothing loud in his appearance ; his voice
was low-pitched, and his personality was charming. He
was soon on friendly terms with all the people staying
in the hotel, and w'as in the place ten days before I sus-
spected anything wrong. Then I heard he had been an
officer in the British army on the African Gold Coast. 1
dislike people w'ho have held commissions on the Gold
Coast or are cursed with relatives in Fiji, and anyhow he
was altogether too young and fresh-looking to have
handled niggers anywhere near the Bight of Benin. I
decided to inspect his luggage, which I found to consist
of one small leather bag containing some silk handker-
chiefs, a pair of clocked socks, and some cards which repre-
sented him and a Gentleman One in Auckland as indent
agents. I hardened my heart, and promptly made out his
account, and when I handed it in I informed him my ac-
counts were due when presented. He put the paper m his
pocket and, smiling blandly, informed me he was going
to the bank right away and would settle on his return.
Then he went. I didn’t see him all day, nor the early
part of the next—in fact, I saw nothing of him till the
third day, when he went by the window of the commer-
cial room on a bike and vanished in dust. It occurred to
me he was leaving and I rang up the police. The police
said he would be watched. As I turned from the tele-
phone the youth walked in, smilingly asked the amount
of his account, and paid from a handful of gold. When
I came to, he had, 1 heard, departed by the train just
then going out. Two days later the hue and cry started.
He had visited the local store and presented his bogus
business card, and made a deal to deliver a ton of
wire at a cash price considerably below the market
quotation. He then hied to the manager of a large
auctioneering firm, presented his card, gave my name as
a reference, and stated he was short of a ton of wire for
immediate delivery. Could the manager oblige him with
the loan of a ton of wire till his own arrived, which
would be by the goods train some time next day. The
manager obliged with a view to future business. In 10
minutes the wire was delivered and paid for by cheque.
Another 10 minutes saw the cheque cashed and myself
paid, and the youth on the train. lam sure that young
man has since become either Great or Habitual.

“Maskee” (from Tientsin, China): Until re-
cently the commercial pirates of Japan have been satisfied
to put their forgeries on own markets. But
although protected in this rascality by every court of so-
called equity in Japan, the local consumer has become
shy. Perpetual publicity has done its work ; the Euro-
pean buyer makes sure that the goods he buys are not
counterfeit, and even the little Nippon man says
“Maskee” when offered the native substitute. Herein
China, although the Mackie treaty is a dead letter, we
stand no nonsense respecting infringement of trade
marks. The law is the white man’s own law. A stray
Chino tries an occasional bit of dodgery ; hut it is soon
over. He is hauled before the Consul of the complainant’s
nationality, heavily fined, and perhaps deported. For
the treaty ports of China are in the judicial hands
of the chief Powers, and their country’s law is
local law. Foreign goods for the interior must
pass through one treaty port or the other, one
has been able to trade and feel sure that his “ chop ” was
safe. To get over this difficulty, this is the latest
Japanese swindle. Lever’s soaps, Rogers and Gallet’s
rouge and scents (great favorites with Chinese ladies).
Rose brand candles, E. Armitage and Sons’ “crocodile”
cotton “ chop,” and various well-known Manchester makes
of cotton piece goods have been elaborately prepared in
Japan, with the exact lithographed trade marks, and then
have been passed through by complaisant Jap. authorities
in Manchuria, whence they have been loaded upon the
great North China market. There seems to be absolutely
no redress. The British merchant is being touched on
the raw. Hit very hard financially, his trade absolutely
stolen, his goods discredited because of the worthless
Japanese muck substituted under his marks, no wonder
that the conservative British Mercantile Gazette, a
one-time whoopist for the dear little brown brother and
the Anglo-Jap treaty, has turned round, and now slashes
at both for all it is worth.
A SONG OF SIXPENCE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The child with sixpence is ma° _r of the world. Lying
statement of a Scotch philosop’ j/‘.
’Tis but a sixpence hi'’ .i pantaloons,
From which the du?. •, of many summer days
Have robbed the freshness of the varied tweed,
Old garments somewhat bulged about the knee
By frequent prayer, scarce worth mine uncle’s smile,
Yet casket for the mightiest thing on earth,
A minted coin. Pale, solitary, lone,
Yet burning with a heat of strong desire
It lies within my pocket. Weak am I,
Yet am I great. The Czar and Kaiser bow
To my august commands ; the millionaire
Sets all his wheels a-rolling when I speak,
And all his paper glory rustles wide,
E’en to the utmost limit of New York,
When my white sceptre jingles. At its chink
Hot niggers reeking in the cotton fields
Sweat yet the more, and all of black and tan
That v.„rners of the world
With scents of empire leaps to do my will.
All China hustles, darkest Africa
Is shaken to her last rhinoceros
By that tremendous power hid in my pants.
The marts are open. Should I buy me store
Of cotton thread, the mills of Manchester
Are all within my power, or, taking pins,
I lay a hand on blackened Birmingham.
Should I desire a scroll of printed lore,
Ten thousand busy brains are at my call,
And every quaint, distorted, newsful lie
Confronts my gaze. An awful trust is mine,
For in my pocket burns the pivot point
Of turning worlds. Alas ! my soul is faint,
My throat is parched, my lips are cracked and dry,
I seek for lemonade, and so I cast
My wealth and all its weight of care on Bung.

KIDNEY TROUBLES.
It is not alone the aching back and the insipid
tired feeling that has to be borne; it is the
constant fear that greater ills will follow. Bright’s
disease, diabetes, gravel, gall stones, inflamma-
tion of the bladder, suppression and retention of
the urine, etc., all result from diseases of the
kidneys. Those who have never been troubled
know not the misery and suffering which those
afflicted undergo.
“ I suffered very severely with kidney complaint
for a long period,” writes Mrs. W. Callaway, 14
Baldwin Street, Erskineville, near Sydney, “and
at last had to go to the Prince Alfred Hospital
for treatment, but with the medicine I took there
and prescribed for me in other ways I found no
relief. At times, when doing household duties,
if occasion occurred that I had to stoop, I could
never get up without assistance. I have been a
martyr for years, and the pains at times were
dreadful. The doctor stated that I had a slight
attack of Bright’s disease, but, notwithstanding
his treatment, I could get no benefit. At last a
friend recommended me to try Dr. Morse’s
Indian Root Pills, and I have now taken some
eighteen bottles and found that they have com-
pletely cured me. Whenever I have a headache
I have recourse to them, and find that by taking
two or three they drive the symptoms away. I
am only too pleased to give you this testimony,
which you may use in any way you wish.”

SPORTING
NOTIONS
The weather at Wanganui for the fatal Decem-
ber 15 was just about perfect, and the shores of the river
and the hills that rose on either side were crowded with
people. If Webb won it was certain that something- dread-
ful would happen in Wanganui, and most likely to Webb.
Wanganuitis is a fearful sort of disease that impels its
victims to tear those they worship to pieces and keep bits
of them as souvenirs. But the strength and skill of Arnst
saved Webb from this hideous though glorious ending,
for the ex-cyclist and sometime winner of the Sydney
Thousand sculled home first, and is now champion of the
world. Webb’s reign was indeed short.
* * * *
Gigantic Ben Thoroughgood is anxious to
challenge the winner of the Arrist-Webb struggle on the
Wanganui (M.L.). But, alas, Benjamin is 40 years of age
or thereabouts, and the sporting gentlemen with well-
lilled bags look askance at the champion of 40 or there-
abouts. Ben has had trouble finding stake-money before
for even minor fry, but against the champion of the world
the chances are that the trouble will be insuperable. So,
although he may be a possible champion of the world, it
is more than likely that the big, kindly sculler will never
have the chance of winning the title, because he is poor.
It is hard luck.

Notwithstanding the added attractions of a
“double balloon ascent with the simultaneous descent of
four parachutists in a thrilling race to earth ” —which,
however, didn’t eventuate quite as per advertisement —
the once world-famed Austral, worth £650 in ’O5, drew
only about 12,000 spectators to the Metropolitan Cricket
Ground last Saturday, and a few less the pre-
ceding week. As fully half these were M.O.C.
and M.B.C. deadheads, the 10 per cent, of gross
takings set aside for the Austral prizes would
hardly exceed the minimum fixed—£loo. But, as the
other prizes only totalled £llO, the club should make a
trifle out of the meeting. The heats on the first
Saturday weeded out all but 14 riders, of whom
only Gascoyne, llehir, Finlay, Shepherd, Lynch,
Colvin, Meyer and Birch—the last three the placed men
last year—had any previous performances to speak of.
The giants Clarke, Farley, Border, etc., were absent, and
Thomas and Pye were “outed” in their heats. The
handicaps of the 14 spread from Gascoyne on scratch to
Craig on the 280yds. mark, but during the week the
handicapper readjusted the starts—and just there some
peculiar things happened. Gascoyne, Hehir, Meyer,
Moore, Birch and Craig w'ere left untouched ; Quinlan,
Finlay, Lynch, King and Carr were brought back
10yds. apiece; Colvin was put back 20yds., and
A. H. Shepherd, who had ridden a poor second to
Colvin in their heat and was also second to Gascoyne
in the placed men’s heat, was brought back 40yds.
Also M. McPherson, who nad won his heat from the
250yds. mark, beating Goodson at 210, Gunch at 260, and
Freeman at 300, was advanced 30yds. no less—level with
Craig at 280. That looked funny, but a still more peculiar
circumstance was the fact that Holy Moses, who was sub-
dued but plentiful, unanimously offered “ six to one bar
one” —the one barred being A. H. Shepherd aforesaid.
“ Even money ” was the best obtainable about him.
The race was even funnier than the handi-
capping or the betting. The two youngsters, Craig
and McPherson, cheerfully paced each other for five of
the eight laps. At that stage McPherson, perceiving that
the field was slowly but surely coming up, went away on
his own, and was still half-a-lap to the good when the bell
rang. Then Shepherd and King(N.S.W.) tore along for
all they were worth, and passed Craig, but were still
80yds. behind McPherson when the pistol cracked. That
nipper’s performance speaks well for his head, in break-
ing away from Craig- when he did, and still more for
his heart, in making his own pace for three hard
laps, but it says dashed little for the handicapper.
But why did that official reduce Shepherd 40yds. ? Time
(4min. 35sec.) was lOsecs. worse than last year. After the
Austral, Gascoyne collared the Derby Biue Riband by a
foot from Hehir, Pye coming third, and Thomas a crop-
per through taking the inside running when jumping
for the post. The rest of the “sport” was a more
circling of whirling wheels, notable only for the fact
that the same A. H. Shepherd won the Victoria Mile
and the M.B.C. Plate and his team took the Club Stakes.
As above mentioned, the balloons belied the
advts., only one being sent up the first day with two
aeronauts attached. One of these foolish persons dropped
placidly into the Fitzroy Gardens; the other, finding some-
thing had gone wrong with his parachute, stayed where
he was till the air-bag came down somewhere out Heidel-
berg way. Last Saturday two gas-bags were elevated
with three parachutists. All of them regained the soil in
casual, undisturbed fashion. One, who landed in the
neighborhood of Foy’s fair, was immediately seized by a
quantity of women, who took him for a bargain and over-
whelmed him with embraces. He was a shy youth, and
said he would take care to land on a roof in future.
The Austral promoters got a large-sized hint as
to the lack of public interest in track bike-racing, the w'eek
before their big event, when the principal cyclists now
pervading the Bent State went Qn strike and declined to
whirl round the Saucer Track any more for the pure fun
of the thing. It appears that the alleged prizes won
a fortnight before were then still unpaid, and as
they didn’t look like being paid in full, and had,
anyhow, been reduced to microscopic proportions
already, the leggy men reckoned the time had arrived
to quit. The Saucer Track shindykit has asked the
League to “ deal with ” the obstreperous unionists—who
include Pye, Thomas, Hehir, Tolley and others—and the
League, after excluding those of its delegates who are
Saucer shareholders, has asked a committee to inquire
into the strike though Heaven knows what the com-
mittee can do or why it should do anything to a man who
quits work when he can’t get his wages. Anyhow, even
if the League disqualifies the \yhole lot of bikists it won’t
matter much—track-raping being at present dead and
quite stiff.

The Australasian tennis championship meeting
in Sydney lacked the intense interest that had marked
the Davfs Cup triumph in Melbourne. Only Alexander
could afford the time to attend, Beals Wright, who has
beaten Brookes three times out of four, may be accorded,
by the slightest possible margin, the palm as champion
tennis-player of the world. He left Australia unbeaten
except in the doubles, while Alexander was beaten by both
our men, Brookes did not think an Australasian champion-
ship worth while, or wasn’t well enough to compete, while
Wilding competed only in the doubles. Alexander part-
nered with Dunlop, the Victorian, and playing in admir-
able combination, they pulled off the final from Wilding'
and Sharpe in easy fashion. Their closest match, how-
ever, was with Jones and Doust, three sets straight, by the
narrowest of possible margins : 6—4, 6—4, 16—14. Against
Wilding and Sharpe, they found in Sharpe a player not
quite up to the top-notch standard, and the second
and third sets of a 6—3, 6—2, 6—l match were
chiefly a merciless plastering of Sharpe, with
Wilding’s brilliancy obscured by his enforced tenancy of
the back line. All through Dunlop and Alexander
adopted the method of having the net-man practically in
the centre of the court and close up. The non-server
usually stood a yard from the centre line, on the left, not
troubling to cross over, no matter from which side his
partner served. Wilding occupied the usual position,
guarding his own side, and the uselessness of this dis-
position was apparent. Alexander and Dunlop stopped
many a weak return, while their opponents’ net man lost
many a chance by not being on the best spot for the
return—the centre of the court.
Modern tennis shows the predominance of the
“American” serve in all its peculiarity of “lift” and
screw ; but the chief development is the accuracy with
which underhand volleys and half-volleys are negotiated.
In the singles the first man to the net on a good ball won
by a cross-court screw. Dunlop has two drives, one with
cut and the other with “ top.” In the final he won the two
first sets, 6—3, 6—3, by faultless tennis ; then, tiring, he
had perforce to give Alexander the next set 6—o. While
his tactics of giving away a set were correct, and had been
used with success against Parker by Alexander on the
previous day, Dunlop made the mistake of not forcing
Alexander in this set. He rightly reserved himself, but
he also let Alexander reserve himself. Condition told,
and the lithe man, with the partiality for iced water after
every game, wore down the heavier Dunlop and took the
match. Dunlop deserves the highest praise for his effort.
His performance in singles and doubles places him among
the world’s top-notehers.

The long struggle for the Petrel Cup, the
ocean race trophy of the Prince Alfred Yachting Club,
came to a finish on Saturday, when Mr. Alick Saxton’s
beautiful Awanui won it for him a third time. He got in
his first leg in 1905 with the Magic—the Petrel Cup is a
three-legged affair, like the arms of the Isle of Man—and
the second one happened along last year with the
Awanui. Saturday’s victory transferred the handsome
utensil to Mr. Saxton’s private sideboard, where it will
be used on state occasions for the purposes of punch.
The Petrel Cup was the donation of Mr. Dempster ;
he presented it to replace Mr. Norman Murray’s
Heather Cup which he had won outright and taken
off the market. So presumably the next- in the line
of succession will be the Awanui Cup, presented by
Mr. Saxton to replace the Petrel Mug. As before men-
tioned, it was an outside race, and it was fully expected
that the deep-lteeler Thelma would do things, while the
sky-scraping Eawhiti was regarded as dangerous. But
the Awanui left them both behind before getting clear of
the harbor, and thence to the crossing of the winning
line was never seriously challenged. On the thresh up
the harbor the Rawhiti’s jib carried away again off
Bradley’s Head, and the accident nearly cost the big
yacht second place, as the fast little Petrel came romping
along behind. But the big yacht managed to stagger
over the line in time, and relegated the Petrel to third
place.

The 18ft. championship of N.S.W. was blown
off in Port Jackson, on Saturday, amidst intense excite-
ment. Fortune flitted about like a distracted bird and
threatened to alight on any one of half a dozen boats. At
the start the Eileen and Australian were hot favorites,
but 'soon it became apparent that the Vision was
fast when occasion demanded it, while the Eileen
went back on all previous good performances in a
most disappointing manner. After a great struggle the
Australian got clear of the Vision and the rest, and the
crew started to breathe freely once more. Just as it
breathed freely the Zena, with a new big mainsail, chal-
lenged, and while the struggle raged the Eileen came
again, and the three were abreast. Then the Vision went
to the front, but the Australian, leaving the Eileen and
Zena behind, also passed the Vision. The wind freshened,
and the boats began to plunge. The Vision and Austra-
lian got tangled up, and the latter narrowly escaped
a capsize ; but, getting loose, the Australian went to
the front on the wind, and was easily first at Shark
Island. Lying fourth in the long procession was the little
skiff Oweenee —unobtrusive, unsuspected. That skiff pre-
sently came with a tremendous rush, and one after
another overhauled all of the leaders but the Aus-
tralian, which was too far in front to be beaten, bar-
ring accident. And just approaching the buoy the acci-
dent happened ; with only a mile to go to the winning
line the lower peak halyard block carried away, and the
crippled giant, with 33sec. in hand, was slowly overhauled
by the skiff, and eventually beaten by I2sec. The points
for the championship are now : Oweenee 7, Australian 5,
Eileen 4, Vision 2, Zena and Livonia I each.

In Sydney the sixth round of the First Grade
Cricket competition commenced in heavy, oppressive
weather. Many of the big dogs were away in Brisbane
wiping the floor with the Bananalanders, and their places
were taken by youngsters eager to make the most of their
opportunities. But the only centuries that happened
along were those of R. V. Single and L. W. Pye, both of
Central Cumberland, who smote the Bedfern bowlers to
the tune of 105 and 123 respectively. But they were com-
paratively the only pebbles on the beach, and, in spite of
this tremendous lift, the Cumberland crowd vanished for
379, the two centuries being counterbalanced by three
waterfowl nailed to the board. Bedfern responded with the
loss of two wickets for 29 runs, so, although the Cumber-
land score is not so large as it might well have been, it will
probably prove large enough. A player who had hard
luck was Grounds, of Glebe, who had made 96 and was
going strong for the century when a straight one from
Whitting got past him and cut things short, like the shirt
Wilson Barrett used to wear in “Claudian.” Gow, of
Paddington, also played a useful game for his club, and
when he passed into the dim procession of the dead he
left a monument of 88 behind him. Sydney, a club that
usually acts as a chopping block on which other
teams hammer out their fame and glory, met North
Sydney on Saturday and quite astonished itself by
piling up 220 against that formidable combination.
North responded with 79 for the loss of two
wickets. When Glebe came down on Balmain at
Wentworth Park it got straight to business, and with
steady bashing, slogged up 362 for the loss of eight
wickets. Then the light gave out, and Glebe retired, to
be continued in our next. Gordon began a disastrous
affair with Waverley, being outed for 102, while Waverley
responded with 136 for the loss of four wickets, wherefore
there is gloom around the district of Premier Wade. Bur-
wood, opposed to the baby club, Petersham, failed to
revive its past glory in any way, and stole away to its
pavilion, leaving 161 behind it as a monument of its life
work. Petersham made 65 for the loss of seven wickets.
Paddington went down to Manly and met Middle Harbor
in the cool surfy breezes, which braced up Noble’s crowd
so much that although he was far away it piled up 218.
But it looks as though this would be barely sufficient, as
Middle Harbor accumulated 108 for the loss of six wickets.

The Bulletin regrets to hear that Victor
Trumper, at whom it has thrown many bricks of late, is
in such bad health that he has had to relinquish cricket
for at least some considerable time, and that it is more
than possible that the great batsman will never again be
as he was. Mr. Trumper’s trouble is of a pulmonary
nature. The writer joins with his many admirers in
wishing him a speedy recovery.

Another round of Melbourne pennant cricket
finished on Saturday, with only one really worthy exhibi-
tion. Riohmond, with five down for 119 against North
Melbourne’s total of 213, looked like losing ; but, owing
mainly to the strenuous efforts of Smith (114) and of
Kelly (90), it carried its score to 402 for nine wickets, thus
winning on the first innings by 189 runs. East Melbourne
defied Collingwood to reach its compilation of 231, and,
as a matter of fact, ’Wood only realised 158 by uneven
batting—which declared the game ended in East’s favor
with a credit of 73 runs. Carlton, urged to eclipse South
Melbourne’s total of 170, responded with 221, thus winning
by 51 on the first strikes. Against P’ran’s total of 206, com _
piled on the previous Saturday, University only yielded 150
in the crushing:, and so surrendered the contest to P’ran
with 56 runs to the bad. St. Hilda, with eight wickets
down for 276 against Essendon’s total of 111, made a wild
reach for a straight-out win, but failed. Declaring its
own innings closed, it gave Essendon another chance at
the wickets with the hope of dismissing the lot by 6 p.m.
But the ’Dons unexpectedly knocked up 202 for six
wickets, so that Saints had to be content with a one
innings victory by 165. Fitzroy, in its argument with
Northcote, just saved its bacon. Required to equal if
not surpass Northcote’s trifle of 267, it hit up 212 for nine
wickets, and it was obviously only the clock that declared
the match a draw.

The athletic Australian again. Fred Janes, a
15-year-old Brisbane boy, whose father pushes Queensland
trade in Chowland and thereabouts, recently, won the
swimming championship of North China for sons of
foreign residents under 20. The race was across Wei-Hai-
Wei Bay to Liukung lao, a distance of 3000yds., and,
despite a choppy sea, young Jones did the trip in record
time.

There isn't even a pretence in some quarters
now of observing Bent’s Anti-Gaming Act. Papers pub-
lish advts. like this :
Great Night’s SroRT Assured.
Open Betting.
And the paper that prints those advts. has quite a lot to
say at times about the importance of maintaining law’n-
order—especially law.
Like the Vic. League footballers, the V.C.A.
hankers after a ground where an attendance of 10,000
won’t necessarily include about 6000 deadheads. It was
moved, the other day, that applications be invited from
other playing places than the Melbourne Cricket Ground
for the inter-State matches ; and the motion was only
withdrawn after much consideration. The delegates
pondered long over the fact that, since the M.C.C. had
increased its membership by 1000, the receipts from inter-
state matches had fallen from £1355 to £754. It. only
needs a few years’ concerted effort by the football and
cricket controllers, and the Carlton ground, which, though
not quite as central, is larger, more accessible and more
beautiful, could be made superior to the Melbourne
ground as far as their clients, the general public, are con-
cerned. The Melbourne ground’s seating accommodation
is unchallengeable as yet ; but most of it, including all
the best places, is reserved for members ; and neither
V.C.A. nor V.F.L. gets a penny from them.

Adelaide city corporation reports having
granted playing-space for the year to 221 athletic clubs
on the Park Lands—the belt immediately surrounding
the heart of the city. This is without reference to
suburban clubs. Lawn tennis comes a good third to
cricket and football ; hockey (which in S.A. is mostly
played by girls) has passed lacrosse ; golf, croquet, and
bowls make up the list.

S.A. cricket XI. against N.S.W, in Adelaide,
this week, will be much the same as the one that beat
Vic, last month, only with another bowler in place of
Hewer (who is away), and with Dolling, the crack
University bat, included. S.A. hopes to make a heavy
score, and to get the Sydney men out “somehow,” as in
Sydney last January.
“ 10-2-4 ”: The main feature of the recent
Blackmore-Stirling scrap at Sydney Stadium was the
work of Deacon Johnson, the Methody champion pug
from Texas (U.S. A.). He was part exhibit, part referee.
In both capacities he proved a sensational success. The
crowd howled with rapture as he walked into the ring.
The colored brother thrust an immense foot behind him,
and bowed low three times, smiling cavernously the
while. Yells of “ Good on yer, Deacon,” and “Show us
yer fangs ” resounded. The warmth of his reception
flabbergasted Johnson somewhat, and his smile contracted
by four or five inches. Then the fight began. His method
of “ breaking ” the men was new to those present, and it
“ went ” like a runaway train. The moment they clinched
the big nig. thundered forward and slapped the more
adhesive of the pair on the back. At the same time he
screamed the word “break” in the voice of a caveman
who has been gripped in a tender spot by an ichthyosaurus.
The first time Johnson did this an inebriate who was
sitting beside me fell crashing over the back of the seat,
and lay gibbering and havering on the ground till friends
came to his aid. The uproar and unusualness of it utterly
demoralised the combatants. When the onlookers got
used to it they ceased to attend to the fight
which was a feeble sort of affair at best and
only looked out for Johnson’s “ turn.” In the
intervals they' besought the devotional blackamoor
“to take off his boots” so that they might see, the
struggle ; also, they asked him to “ lead in prayer,” or to
favor with a stave from the “Old Hundredth.” Just as
the expression in Johnson’s face betokened that be
was meditating the advisableness of correcting some of
the gibers in his neighborhood per medium of a hurled
hymn-book or Family Bible, the towel came in from Stir-
ling’s corner, and an interesting though unconventional
entertainment ended.

In the recent “Olympic” boxing champion-
ships in England the winner of the featherweights was
R. K. Gunn, champion from 1894 to 1896 ; though now
38, he comfortably settled all the younger men. Douglas,
who beat “Snowy” Baker in the final of the feather-
weights, is the Essex cricketer (and son of the president
of the Amateur Boxing Association). Several Frenchmen
and one Dane entered at various weights, but were all
pluck and no science.
* * * *
“ Bloggs ” : The immense Rushcutters Bay
Stadium was more than half full of Snowy Bakerites on
last Monday night. The “Welcome” accorded the
returned champion consisted of howls, “turns,” and gore.
The howls went on during most of the welcome (those
assembled to give greeting being a ribald and uproarious
lot); the “ turns ” were short and infrequent (which was
providential, for they were exceeding bad), and then
“ Calves ” Suttor hopped into the roped arena and intro-
duced the flaxen-haired pug to a crowd that knew
him a darned sight better than it did the Calves person.
Suttor is a prolix speaker. He doesn’t know' when his
audience has had enough—a fatal defect in one who essays
to orate before patrons of stoush. Soon verbal insult
began to be discharged at Suttor. Snoww, who stood
embarrassedly beside the rhetorician, was implored
to “out” his companion. “Bash ’im on the
jore, Snowy,” urged' a spectator passionately.
“ Show us yer form,” demanded another, “ and parss the
ole blighter one in the stummick.” None too soon Suttor
desisted and left the scene. Tommy Burns arrived
shortly afterwards, and boxed four rounds with the hero
of the evening. It was an interesting demonstration of the
wide gulf that yawns between the pro. and the amateur in
theboxinggame. Theßurnsfootw'ork waslittleinevidence.
It wasn’t needed. On the form exhibited Thomas might
have had his boots riveted to the floor, and w'ithal have
out the Australian amateur fighter’s pride arid
joy in a round or two. Enough blood was in evidence to
give the ladies present a pleasing thrill. A curious
feature of the show was the wild joy that obtained '''hen
Tommy slammed Baker one or two about the head. I
think Baker’s welcomers would have well-nigh swooned
with bliss had Burns knocked their idol out for half-an-
hour or so.

Somebody writes in for information as to what
became of the heavyweight championship of the world
after the retirement of James Jeffries, and as to
how it eventually found its way into the i keeping of
Tommy Burns. It seeuis that when Mr. Jeffries retired
from the actual defence of the title he kept the thing
locked up at home for safety, or carried it round his neck
or smnething', till he happened to be acting as referee at
a scrap between Marvin Hart and Jack Root at Reno,
Nevada. Hart knocked Root out in the 12th round, and
Jeffries was so delighted at his styde (or else he was just
feeling so plain good on general principles), that he
awarded Hart the fight, the large end of the purse, and,
finally,, in a burst of magnificence, handed him his own
title, charging him to defend it with his nose blood. This
was on July' 3,1905. On January. 15, 1900, Patsy Callahan
attacked Hart, but was wiped up in two rounds, and the
title was still where Jeffries had placed it. On February
23 Tommy Burns was at Los Angeles, where he found
Hart, and after 20 savage rounds Tommy 7 tore Marvin s
bauble from him, and has worn it ever since.
On close inspection, the much-boomed physical
advantages of Johnson over Burns vanish into thin smoke
and motor-perfume. His Excellency Johnson is some
three years older than Mr. Burns, and in bruising, as in
love, youth counts for a lot. The curious feature is that,
although Johnson is 6ft. £in. tall against Burns’ sft. 7in.,
there is hardly a pound difference in their weights. That
sJin. disparity is thought by 7 some to give Johnson a tre-
mendous advantage in the matter of reach. But it is
even more than the actual difference between their
heights, as Burns increases it by his characteristic
crouch, and what was an advantage becomes a positive
drawback. Johnson will have to hit down, which is a
disconcerting thing, and, worse than all, his tender spot,
where he lives, the seat of his soul, his solar plexus, will
be right opposite to Burns’ main battery 7 . Of course,
there is a swipe known as an upper-cut, but it is. not so
formidable as it used to, be ; writer has a conviction that,
if ever Burns comes to grief, it will be a sudden cross that
will wreck his glory.
There are some disquieting rumors floating
round. One is that unless two judges are appointed,
in addition to the referee, Excellency Johnson will
decline to enter the ring. In which case, Johnson will
probably 7 carry his point. The other is that if he smashes
Tahnimy up and wins the world’s championship, Johnson
will immediately draw the color line. And there is no
earthly reason why he should not. If it is a fair and
reasonable thing for a white fighter to refuse to allow 7 a
black or colored man to compete for the championship, a
colored champion is quite within his rights in refusing to
meet “ white trash.”

owing to another outbreak by Tom Burrows
and Frank Lloyd, of S’Africa, the world’s record for club-
swinging has been advanced 10 more minutes, and now
stands at 66 hours 10 minutes. The upheaval was sup-
posed to be a struggle between Lloyd and Harrows for
the championship, but early in the tussle Burrow's got
disqualified by the referee. The manager of the hall re-
fused to stop the offender, on the ground that if he stopped
the whole show would burst up. So Burrows swung on,
and finished fresh as paint ; but Lloyd got the champion-
ship and the money. If is to be hoped that a Congress of
Club-Weary 7 Nations will eventuate soon and prevent any
repetition of this horror.
* * * *
That disqualification of Yankee runner Car-
penter by the British A. A. Association for fouling
Haswell in the 400-metre race at, the Olympic Games in
London, has led to strained relations between the British
and Yankee governing bodies. The Yankee crowd has
ignored the British disqualification, and has announced
that in future Yankees will not be allowed to compete k t
international fixtures unless the management has been
previously approved of by the Yankee body 7. Which
means, brutally, that in future Yankees will not compete
outside of America, and a good job too, as they seem to
be incapable of giving anyone a fair deal. They will not
be missed.
Maoriland’s laws for the discouragement
of the big land-grabber and the encouragement of
the small land-user may still be some distance
from perfect, but the results are on the right track
anyhow. Between 1904 and 1908 every size of
holding up to 10,000 acres became more numerous;
and every size of holding over 10,000 acres became
less numerous. There are still 84 holdings of over
50,000 acres; and that sounds bad until you hear
that in 1904 there were 96 of them.

N.S.W.’s Wade Government, after two defeats,
is not yet done with that unfortunate Hay publican
who was fined because his lodgers were found
playing dice after hours, the landlord himself
being quite unaware of their doings as they had
locked themselves in a bedroom. The Full Court
blew out “ the Crown ” with contumely and much
Costs, and now “ the Crown ” has applied to the
High Court with more Costs for leave to appeal
against the Full Court’s decision. The High
Court said a lot of things to the learned counsel
who appeared for the poor old Crown, but in the
end the Court granted the appeal on the under-
taking that the N.S.W. Government is to. pay all
the Costs whichever way the decision goes.
Wade’s hunger for litigation and his fearful bad
luck with it are costing N.S.W. a heap of money.

“ Adelaide ” writes :
A par (B. 26/11/’08) gives S.A. credit for allowing a
man to marry his deceased wife’s niece as an alternative
to his d.w.’s sister—“and S.A. is the only State that did
think of it.” Well, “ without wishing to boast ” (as J.
Johnson says), we claim that S.A. quite usually does
think of things several years before her sisters. But
don’t let us claim credit unduly in this case. The d.w.’s
niece was included in our local Act (away back in 1870)
simply because a Legislative Councillor, who was a
widower, badly wanted to marry a lady who stood
in that precise relationship to him ; in fact, the
measure was popularly known as “ ’s Relief
Bill.” That’s all the far-seeing statesmanship there
was about it! Why they didn’t let in the Deceased Hus-
band’s Brother (whom Moses held the only fic person fora
widow to marry) and all the more remote connections at
the same time, seems strange ; but then nobody hap-
pened to be sufficiently interested in any of them. I know
a man in one Australian capital who had an odd fancy to
marry his deceased wife’s aunt —a thing which no law-
maker could ever have anticipated. It is quite illegal,
but he simply married her without worrying, and nobody
else has worried either.
The usual trade circular happens along—
this time from the Nugget Polish people, of Ken-
nington Oval, London. These people set forth
(1) that they have decided to manufacture in
Australia instead of importing (quite a lot of
people have decided to manufacture in Australia
since the tariff came to pass); (2) that they are
making a large reduction in price (quite a lot of
people have done that also since the tariff arrived).
The travelling Australian does good for his
eountry-sometimes, and Australia, especially Sydney, is
richer to-day because Mr. J. N. Grace, one of the owners
of the Model Store, Broadway, Glebe, went a-travelling.
He has an eye for the beautiful, and while in London
happened upon some beautifully-etched reproductions of
great pictures. He bought the lot and sent them out to
make a Christmas bargain at the Model Store. Among
them are copies of such works of genius as Whistler’s
pier of old Battersea Bridge, which that wonder-
ful wizard of the brush included in his Nocturnes
in Blue and Silver, and which, being one of his many
masterpieces, was promptly bought by the British nation
and enshrined in the Tate Gallery among other im-
mortals. Other artists whose work is placed on tap are
Balestrieri, of Paris, with a Venetian scene ; Corot, with
his “ Souvenir d’ltalie ”; “ Paysage D’Ete ” and “ Danse de
Bergers de Sorrente,” Hermann Ritter, Gainsborough,
P. C. Helleu, and others too numerous to mention. It is
an unique opportunity to get really superb pictures at
most ridiculously low prices.*
“ K.” tells the story of the wreck of
Brown’s pie :
Brown was our accountant, with a deep aversion for
restaurants. The office was too far away to allow him to
go home for lunch, so he was forced to bring his nourish-
ment with him. Brown had a capable cook, with an
enthusiasm for constructing beautiful meat pies, and
every morning he would hurry in bearing a small kit-bag
containing one of these triumphs. It was always put
up on a small plate or a large saucer, and Brown ate it
cold until, one day, happening to notice that the lid of
the hot-water cauldron was a little smaller than the uten-
sil on which his pie rested, the idea struck him to remove
the lid of the cauldron and place his pie over the opening.
The plan acted beautifully ; .the steam heated the pie and
he had a warm dinner. Brown was delighted with the
discovery, but the advertising manager and myself went
up-stage like villains in a play and muttered fierce
asides. The cauldron was situated in the fireplace in our
room, and Brown’s cooking operations made the apart-
ment smell like three restaurants and a fried-fish-shop in
full blast. We worked every day from after lunch until
closing time in an atmosphere redolent of onions and
gravy, and the only protest we could make was to write
sarcastic remarks on slips of paper and attach them to
the pie with penhandles. But at last vengeance overtook
Brown’s mid-day nourishment. One Thursday we were
both hard lat work at our respective desks, and the
only sound in the room was the gentle hissing
of the gas under the cauldron. Suddenly I
heard a heavy “ Plop! ” as if an elderly frog had
remembered an appointment, and jumped hastily into a
pool to fulfil it. It was a gentle, soothing sound, and
suggested the green marshy banks of a river slumbering
in the twilight. Half-aroused, I looked at the ceiling,
conjured up a vision of a fat, serious frog falling into still
water, then dismissed it and plunged again into my
figures. A minute or two ebbed away, and the advertis-
ing manager looked up and remarked thoughtfully,
“ Was that something falling into the kettle just now?”
I threw down my pen and swung round on my chair.
The pie had vanished ! Also steam was rushing up the
chimney in clouds, and the cauldron was gurgling as if it
had something in its throat and was trying to cough it
up. I made a dash for the scene of the disaster, and,
looking in, observed fragments of the masterpiece swirling
round in the boiling water. A prowling office-boy who just
happened to wander in raised the alarm, and Brown hur-
ried to the battlefield and demanded the name of the
man who had pushed his pie. Without waiting for an
answer, he thrust his head recklessly into the steam and
peered at the fiercely bubbling water. In a minute he
emerged, gasping for breath. “ The saucer !” he hissed.
“ The saucer ivas too small. The thing was only resting
on the paste rim ! ” A fearful scene then ensued. Brown
valiantly tackled the awful job of emptying the mush out
of the kettle and cleaning it in front of a hungry crowd
of juniors who had arrived armed with teapots and billy-
cans for hot water. Everyone was fearfully respectful
and sympathetic, and privately hoped that Brown would
take the warning to heart. He did. Next day he arrived
with a larger pie, mounted on a plate that would have
been safe bn top of a volcano.
What is known as Myers’ “ Model Farm,
1550 acres of fine country about nine miles out
from Grenfell (N.S.W.), was sold by auction the
other day, late proprietor Henry Myers having
died. And the purchaser was G. H.,. Greene,
M.L.C., of landra, the biggest landowner of those
parts, and the biggest landlord under the cursed
share-system in the State. This supplies another
instance of the crying need of a graduated land-
tax, not only to break up big estates but to keep
them broken up.
S. M. Herald, calling on the Federal
Senate to pass the Iron Bonus Bill and give a
leg-up to a N.S.W. industry :
Meanwhile, we continue to be dependent on over-sea
countries for the bulk of our supplies ; a state of affairs
dangerous in the extreme in time of war, while a doubt-
ful policy even in time of peace.
This laudable sentiment means the jettisoning of
the Freetrade idea. It has taken the Herald a
very long while to realise the danger of depending
on imports from over-sea, and even now it has
only realised it so far as a N.S.W. industry is
concerned.
Two English parallels :
One-tenth of England’s
working men are unem-
ployed and starring. Wages
paid in Britain for the first
eight months of 1908 were
£15,000,000 less than in the
corresponding period of
1907. “Hunger Marches”
and “ Hunger Strikes” have
been organised in the me-
tropolis (the hunger striker
is a starving man who lays
himself down to die pub-
licly). The hop industry is
ruined ; shipbuilding is
almost at a standstill. Trade
is £100,000,000 less than it
was last year. —London
cablegrams.
The season of 1908 stands
out as conspicuous for the
unwonted splendor with
which the great hostesses
have entertained their
guests. Never has the
life de luxe reached greater
heights than during the
past few weeks: never has
the rush been greater, or
the revels more brilliant;
never has dress been so
costly, or hospitality more
epicurean ; never have the
great houses vied with one
another to a greater extent
in the perfection of their
hospitality and in the
lavishness of their schemes
of decoration. —The Lady’s
Realm (London).
“ A troubled land’s twin portents, there they
stand ! ” The life of the clemmed on the left,
and on the right the life of the gemmed. No
need to wonder why the voice of Socialism sounds
in the Old Land such an exceeding bitter cry.
As the street singer once wheezily would drone to
us, “ What will become of Eng-er-land if things
goes on this wy ? ”
Apropos the retirement of N.S.W. Chief-
Justice Darley, his Katoomba home has been sold
to one of the wealthy Vickerys, who is cutting up
“the park” and disposing of it in allotments,
which it is said will pay for the house and the 20
acres surrounding it. The Woollahra home has
been “passed in” at £6500. Mr. Darley is the
only N.S.W. Chief-Justice who had property of
any value to dispose of on retirement or at death.
All his predecessors were poor men. James
Martin had only his salary, and Alfred Stephen
his pension, at death, and no one ever accused
Forbes or Dowling of affluence.
By this paper’s Oldest Inhabitant :
A lady whose name recalls the days of middle-aged
Sydney died at Neutral Bay last week. Mrs. Charlotte
Mary Oarvosso, who was in her 80th year, came to the
city in 1832 with her father, Mr. Henry Keck. Henry
Keek arrived with an idea that he would fill the post of
private secretary to Governor Bourke, hut the Governor’s
son Richard was then in the billet, and when he retired
to Ireland, leaving a small scandal behind him, according
to “Major” Mudie, Mr. George Kenyon Holden became
private secretary. An appointment was, however, found
for Mr. Keck (called by S. M. Herald “Colonel” Keck),
who had held, it is said, some minor post in connection with
Dublin Castle. The billet found was not quite so gaudy
as the private secretaryship—it was that of assistant
superintendent of the Phoenix hulk, which lay in what is
now known as Lavender Bay, so named after the
boatswain of the hulk. When the prisoners were re-
moved from the hulk to the old gaol in Lower George-
street, Mr. Keck took charge there, and when Darling-
hurst was opened he became first gaoler in that institu-
tion. He is said to have conducted the gaol on very
liberal lines, prisoners for debt or for contempt of Court
being allowed out on condition that they returned at
nightfall. Mr. Keck left the gaol about 1850 and became
clerk of the markets, a post in which he was succeeded
by the father of Mr. Joseph H. Carruthers. Miss Keck, the
lady just deceased, was married three times. Her first
husband was Samuel Terry Hughes, a son of Mr. John
Terry Hughes, of the Albion Estate, and grand-nephew
of Samuel Terry, the Botany Bay Rothschild. He died
in 1865, aged 36 years. The widow then became Mrs.
Henry Sedgwick, and when Sedgwick pas>ed hence in
1875, she became the wife of Captain Carvosso, w'ho left
this earthly sphere about ten years ago.

CONSTIPATION AND BILIOUSNESS
Removed by fiutnow’s Powder.
NO functions are more frequently disturbed than those of digestion. Although not dangerous in
themselves, such disturbances nevertheless interfere with the active duties of life, and render
us less able to resist the various forms of disease, so that their consideration becomes of vast
importance. There is nothing more injurious in its effects than undue retention of food in the
stomach. The regular use of Kutnow’s Powder prevents such disturbances and acts as a safeguard
against disease. Kutnow’s Powder is a universal remedy for Constipation, Biliousness and Liver
Troubles. We ask you to try its merits at once, and you will never regret the trial.
AN EFFICIENT REMEDY.
All debris left from imperfectly digested food becomes
poisonous and vitiates the blood. Kutnow’s Powder
entirely removes these poisons from the system.
The symptoms of constipation are frequently exhibited
in the appearance of pimples, boils, skin blotches, and
other bodily disfigurements.
Nervous headache, despondency, brain-fag, insomnia,
and even insanity can frequently be traced to this baneful
irregularity.
Kutnow’s Powder permanently removes Constipation,
Indigestion, Biliousness, and all stomach troubles.
How to Avoid Fraudulent Substitutes.
The Genuine Kutnow’s Powder can be had of all conscientious Chemists throughout
the World. See that the fac-simile signature, “S. Xutnow & Co., Ld.,” and the
registered trade mark, “ Hirschensprung, or Deer Deap,” are on the package and
bottle. This is
How to get Genuine Kutnow’s Powder.
MAKES YOU HEALTHY.
H. C. M OFF ATT, Esq.,
WRITES :
“ Boyton Manor, Codford, Wilts, January 17,1908.
“ Thanks for your parcel of seven bottles of Kutnow’s
Powder, which I received this morning, and I am much
obliged to you for sending it off so promptly. I have
used this Powder for some years, and find its effects are
most beneficial—in fact, I am hardly ever without it.
I can fully recommend it as being the best aperient
powder I know of, as its action is not violent, while it is
invariably the same, and can always be relied on.”
Nurse WIEEETT
WRITES :
“11 Stockmar Hoad, Hackney, N.E., January 3rd, 1908.
“ I gave Kutnow’s Powder to a lady who was suffering
from indigestion and constipation in a very bad form.
After taking a few doses she was very much relieved. I
shall speak most highly of it to others who are suffering.”

Headache, Indigestion,
Constipation and Biliousness.
o
The immense number of orders fox
Frootoids, sent by post direct to the Pro-
prietor, is convincing proof that the
Public appreciate their splendid curing
oower over the above-named complaints.
Frootoids are elegant in appearance and
pleasant to take; they are immensely
more valuable than an ordinary aperient,
they remove from the blood, tissues, and
internal organs, waste poisonous matter
that is clogging them and choking the
channels that lead to and from them.
The beneficial effects of Frootoids are
evident by the disappearance of headache,
a bright, cheery sense of perfect health
taking the place of sluggish, depressed
feelings, by the liver acting properly, and
by the food being properly digested.
Frootoids are the proper aperient medi-
cine to take when any Congestion or
Blood Poison is present, or when Conges-
tion of the Brain or Appoplexy is present
or threatening. They have been tested,
and have been proved to afford quick:
relief in such cases when other aperients

Frootoids act splendidly on the liver;
a dose taken at bed-time, once a week, is
highly beneficial.
A constipated habit of body will be
completely cured if the patient will on
each occasion, when suffering, take a dose
of Frootoids, instead of an ordinary
aperient. The patient thus gradual y
becomes independent of Aperient Medi-
cines.

“ Grub ” : I’ll bet my boots the German Emperor’s sup-
pressed article for the Century Magazine comes out.
You can’t choke them down. Yet the very first example
to my hand seems to point the other way. About 40 years
ago Donald Stewart was fined ss. in the Geelong- Police
Court for drunkenness. He went to the newspaper editor
with a£l bribe to keep his name out. Said the editor,“ It
wasn’t going in, but now it shall.” Yet it appeared next
morning as Ranald Steinwart. But to more important
matters: Christie Murray, in his autobiography, tells
how he saw a carefully preserved proof of a
chapter in “Our Mutual Friend,” where Silas
Wegg killed the Golden Dustman. Yet Dickens had
ordered every proof to be destroyed, and the type dis-
tributed. The best cartoon of London Punch was sup-
pressed, yet it is familiar. The subject was a shoal of
Hebrews swimming across the Red Sea, apropos Dis-
raeli’s act in borrowing from the Rothschildren for the
purchase of the Suez Canal shares. Thackeray sup-
pressed an illustration (his own drawing) for “ Vanity
Fair.” It represented the discomfiture of Steyne, and it
was suppressed because the likeness was of Lord Hertford.
Yet the picture is familiar. Kipling had to alter the con-
clusion of “The Light that Failed” at the publisher’s
dictation. Good Words piously mangled Reade’s
“Cloister and the Hearth.” Yet those works are in their
pristine beauty. Problem : How much more did the
Kaiser pay the Century for suppressing his yarn than
M’Clure paid Ellen Terry for her autobiography?

“Aster Nirvanae”: Someone recently wrote that
Adelaide was the home of the sweated man reporter and
the main support of the boy scribe. As far as the boy is
concerned, some of the Sydney trade papers would be
hard to beat. Know one case in which a youth of 17 is,
on day of issue, transmogrified into a donkey, or pack
mule, and staggers to the G.P.O. under repeated loads of
the sausage wrapper. Before publication he acts as short-
hand clerk and typist, taking down from dictation leaders
and other powerful effusions of the proprietor. He is also
correspondence clerk, account collector, advertisement
canvasser and other things. When he is not busy he
writes articles and pars himself, but never by any chance
on the subject of sweating. When cases concerning
trades that advertise come before the Court he does
verbatim reports, and in between times writes up inter-
views, lectures, meetings and so forth. And when he has
done all these things he fills in time wrapping up, run-
ning messages and perpetrating odd jobs. He is paid
17s. 6d. per week, and when he recently applied for a rise
was told he was not worth it. If he stays on he isn’t.

“Globe-Trotter”: Am with “ C.” (B. 22/10/’OS) all the
time in his denunciation of the folly of the cableman in
perpetually quoting the opinions of Times leader writers as
being authoritative and final. Yet, in defence of the cable-
man, it might be pleaded that it is a part of his general
instructions to play up to the silly traditions of a sillier
public. Some years ago I was domiciled in a continental
European town where there was a considerable British
colony. On a matter then of grave local importance, but
now of no interest to anybody, the colony was much
I was chairman of a faction which was appa-
rently in a hopeless minority, and I have small doubt
now that I was wrong. Private business took me to
London, where some slight connection with the ruling
powers at Printing House Square led to my being in-
vited to air my views in the form of a leader.
On the appearance of this, my opponents, including
all the ambassadorial and consular big guns who
had previously made my life a burden, promptly changed
their views, and, on my return, had the cheek to call my
attention to the article, and to say that those were the
opinions they had really held all along. *
“ Billo ”: A Sydney Labor Council delegate has given
notice of a motion to allow none but bona-fide unionist
pressmen (i.e., members of the N.S.W. Journalists’ Insti-
tute) to sit at the press table during the Council’s delib-
erations. If the motion is carried, it is to be hoped that
it will have the effect of making some of the Council
members act with a semblance of decency towards the
reporters who have to go there to earn their living. The
wonder of it is, considering the treatment he receives
from certain Labor people—certainly the most insig-
nificant—that all pressmen are not the wildest Tories.
The reporter who goes to the Employers’Federation or any
similar Fat body gets courteous and decent treatment,
but when he happens across the fag end of the Labor
movement he has to bite his lips under a succession of
insults which are all the more cowardly because his
position prevents his rising to resent them. The unfair-
ness of the whole thing is accentuated by the fact that
nine pressmen out of ten are absolute Socialists, and vote
Labor every time. The Labor man would think anybody
mad who suggested that his views must necessarily be the
same as those of the Tory millionaire who employs him ;
but he at once assumes that the reporter, who draws a
salary working out at about Is. an hour, must endorse the
foolish observations in the leading columns of the journal
he works for.
Maoriland’s ultra-conservative newspaper, the Dominion,
has been publishing an account of the position and
prospects of agriculture in England. And it is a
sweeping condemnation of the state of things that the
crowd the Dominion represents has done its level best
to bring about in Maoriland. It scoffs at the foolish-
ness of a nation which turns its food-growing areas into
game preserves in order that the landlord may extract
£1 per brace of grouse and 7s. to 10s. for a pair of par-
tridges. And, most horrible of all, it advocates the
compulsory breaking up of these huge estates which
greed of splendor and social considerations have with-
drawn from the production of food. It’s the old story
—freedom for every country but our own.

Greslev Lukin turned the late Ernest Favenc definitely
into the Inky Way. Favenc was physically and mentally
a fine type of Australian adventurer (for though an Eng-
lishman, he acclimatised quickly) when first introduced
to Lukin, who then was part owner of the Queenslander
and Courier, some 33 years ago. Lukin, now controlling
the Wellington Evening Post (M.L.), was a thorough-
bred Australian, a Tasmanian native, who had graduated
through the Lands Department into journalism, and
carried a heart about six times too big for his monetary
resources. He started a Queenslander exploration party
to Port Darwin, put Favenc in charge, and mapped out
a course. Favenc did some good descriptive work as the
outcome of that trip, and soon after that took steadily to
the pen, which he pushed industriously on and off till
almost his last day.
TO OUR BREAD AND BUTTER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Mr. Reid has announced his retirement from the posi-
tion of leader of the Opposition.— News Item.
Tidings of gloom ! George ! Houston ! Must you go ?
And is it Yea or Nay, or just Yes-No ?
But hear me first, a deputationist
Prom those mid whom you will be sadly missed.
Prom unfinancial scribes whose jingle rhymes
Must e’er reflect the manners of the times ;
From pale cartoonists whose gaunt fingers creep
To limn your form, unconsciously, in sleep.
Say not those happy, careless days are gone,
When, being stumped for themes, we turned you on !
When the “idea ” was coy, what need to grope?
Was not our motto, “ While there’s Reid there’s hope ? ”
Ay, many a night we’ve sat with puckered brow,
Chewing our pen, e’en as the patient cow
Mangles her cud, till, faced with mental wreck,
We fled to you—and won the fatted cheque.
Now whither shall we turn ? Yet our distress
Is tinged with hope ; for, tho’ you've murmured “ Yes,”
Tho’ you have said distinctly you must go,
We’re listening for the old familiar “ No.”
’Tis not mere politics with which you play,
The bread of bards hangs on your yea or nay.
Have you not realised, with sudden fear,
That you are trifling with an artist’s beer?
Yet if it is, indeed, at last “ Good-bye,”
Man of theinturned toe and glaz6d eye,
Let us reflect, as we bemoan our fate,
You’ve paid us handsomely, at any rate.
A failure ? Nay 1 Whatever you may be—
Doomed, disappointed, dead politicly,
In this, at least, you’ve been the Grand Success ;
You’ve won us thousands from the weekly press.

Some Woman buys
for every home
and rightly so, as she goes more thoroughly into the matter than a man. The latter,
especially if he is a busy man, is inclined to take very little trouble, but the woman is
different—she wants to know the why and wherefore of everything; so that it is good policy
for the woman to do the buying. A glance at our daily batch of country letters, or a glance
into our establishment, amply proves this, and at the same time proves that Stewart
Dawson’s has the confidence of a big percentage of the womenfolk of New South Wales.

From the press gallery :
N.S.W. Parliament has “considered” the Estimates.
The biessed Estimates are supposed to be a list of salaries
and services for the financial year. The financial year
starts on July 1. The blamed Estimates come on
about December 1, after half the amount has been
spent and there are about two weeks to discuss
them ’ in. A humorous point of Parliamentary pro-
cedure is that when, during the year, a member rises
to air a grievance, a fatal point is taken he
can discuss the question when the dashed old Estimates
come on. When the wretched and blue-moulded Esti-
mates do come on there are hundreds of points to discuss.
It is a life and death business to get things through
in time for the Christmas adjournment, which means
that the loyal Government ipajority daren’t waste time
by criticising anything. The Opposition does its best to
discuss the blighted Estimate£s)y talking at random till
3 a.m., while a dozen members are asleep on the benches.
When enough Government supporters are awake at the
one time, the closure is applied, and the disreputable
Estimates go through not altered by one penny. The
Government then throws the whole responsibility of ex-
penditure upon the Legislature on the ground that Par*
liament voted the money ” when the trebly-dashed Esti-
mates were discussed. I can’t find words to fully express
my contempt for the bedraggled Estimates.
Lucy, in his London letter to the S. M.
Herald, makes British War-Minister Haldane
responsible for this bit of cold-blooded candor :
It’s an ill wind that blows nobody good. The condition
of the unemployed is a deplorable circumstance. But its
existence makes it possible to put the final touch to the
Territorial army in a much shorter time than I expected.
There is, moreover, the satisfaction that, whilst we are
g etting the pick of laboring men, we are also contributing
to stemming the tide of misery created by the depression
of trade.
“Getting the pick of laboring men’’—getting
the pick of them out of the gutter, where they are
looking for a crust—Heavens, what a confession
for a statesman to make ! If Haldane were a
sexton instead of a dry Scotch lawyer, one could
easily imagine him saying, “My children, alas!
have just died of starvation ; but, thank God, I
shall now have the job of digging graves for them.”

The trail of the new tariff is found in the
most unexpected places. At a little out of the
world spot, called Bittern, in Victoria, a person,
representing' a Maoriland firm, has bought 3000
acres of land from a local.grazier, with the inten-
tion of erecting a woollen mill thereon. The
building and plant are to cost something con-
siderable, for a company with a capital of £100,000
is being formed to run the concern. Half of the
shares have already been taken up, and the erec-
tion of the mill will be commenced without delay.
When completed, it will employ about 200 hands.
This is the sort of infamy the tariff has been
leaving in its wake for a long time past.

It is adapted for a large variety of uses, on shipboard,

etc., for filling cisterns, sprinkler carts, and thresher tanks.
The capacity is large, and but little manual power is
necessary to deliver the maximum quantity of water.
The Pump has two cylinders. The plungers operating
alternately by the long malleable lever produce the same
effect as a. double-acting pump—a smooth, uniform flow
of water from the discharge. Air Chamber can be furn-
ished making the pump useful for fire service.

Many men who at first glance look the picture of health and strength
are but little more than nervous wrecks. Nature gave them a strong
physique, but Nature has been imposed upon, and it is
only a question of time when they will have to acknow-
ledge their weakness to the world. Through ignorance ;
weakness and disease fasten themselves upon men like
a vampire, sapping their life and vitality. For all such
men there is a certain cure in Electricity properly applied.
DRUGS ARE USELESS
in such cases, for the best they can give is an unnatural stimulation such as
spirituous liquors give to the brain, and are more injurious if persisted with.
Electricity, properly applied —as it is with Dr. McLaughlin’s Im-
proved Electric Belt —is the one cure —the only cure —for vital
weakness and disease in men and women. It has cured 500,000 men and
women in Australasia, and we have thousands of testimonials to prove
our assertions. '
It is a positive cure for all Weaknesses, Nervousness, Varicocele, Loss of Vitality,
Stomach, Kidney and Liver Troubles, Rheumatism, Sciatica, and Lumbago/
and when used with our newly-patented Electro-Plastic Truss, is a certain cure for Rupture.
It is easy to use ; no sting 1 , burn or shock ; put it on when you go to bed, and you get up in the
morning feeling like a two-year-old colt. They are guaranteed to give a strong current, instantly felt,
e.nd have special attachments for men. They are within the reach of all; price £1 and up.

“Hiphen’s ” tale of sin :
There were six o! us one blazing Sunday morning
seated in the commercial room of the Metralope Hotel at
Crass waiting for the bar to open. The conversation was
about men and women. Then as the heat outside forced
itself obtrusively upon our notice, our thoughts and
speech drifted to the subject of beer. Little Thoms told
us some entertaining episodes from his own moist career.
He was the new bank clerk, and, though he’d been with
us a riiatter of only three weeks, he had already established
his reputation as a masterly absorber of spirituous
moisture.
The amusing part of it was that his boss, the local bank
magnate, was a teetotal fanatic and a cold-water shriek.
Betting and speculation were rife as to how long the
thirstful Thoms would hold down his billet.
Thoms was in the middle of an interesting narrative :
“ He layed me five poun’ to a half-sov. I couldn’t finish
the lot at a gulp. He handed me the pail o’ beer ” -—-
Just then the door opened, and in walked Thoms’ boss.
He nodded around in his surly way, and sat down.
There was much silence.
“ Don’t let me interrupt you, Mr. Thoms,” he said
chillfully.
Thoms looked round the room helplessly. “ Where
was I ? ” he asked.
“ He was handing you the pail of beer,” his boss sup-
plied.
“ Hr—yes ! He handed me the pot of beer ”
“ Pail ! ” from the boss.
“Pail it was, sir,” stammered Thoms. “He—er—
handed me the pail of beer—er—pail of beer, and I—l
took it, and, emptying it on to the floor, turned on him
and said: ‘ The man who drinks for the sake of drinking
is little better than a beast.’”
“ Your words do you credit, Mr. Thoms,” said the bank
manager, warmly.
Thoms threw a, glance of triumph at us out of the
corner of his eye, and, now fairly in his stride, went
on with his moral, extempore story, to the gratification
of his boss and to our unbounded delight.
But, alas! before he reached the end he was inter-
rupted again.
The boy had come into the room to tidy the stationery.
He caught sight of Thoms—of Thoms, whom oft he had
led to bed.
An expression of blank astonishment o’erspread his
ingenuous features.
“ w hy> Mr. Thoms !” he gasped, in undisguised amaze-
ment, “ don’t y’ know the bar’s open ? ” ’
Thoms has since been transferred.

AN OBSTINATE PATCH
OF PIMPLES.
Completely Removed
in Two Days.
In the following. Miss Sophy Henderson, of
12 Reiby Street, Enmore, Sydney, describes how
a disfiguration which worried her for two months
disappeared almost at once under treatment by
Laxo-Tonic Pills: —
“ Laxo-Tonic Pills removed an unsightly patch
of pimples from my face which for two months
had resisted every possible remedy. These
breakings out were of a scabby nature and
covered a portion of my chin and cheek. They
were such a disfigurement that I didn’t care to go
out of the house in the day time. I occupied ray
time in taking all the medicines I could think of,
in addition to which I anointed my face with
liniment and curative soaps. All this, however,
was wasted time, as these things had absolutely
no effect upon the obstinate patch of pimples.
One day a friend of mine gave me a box of Laxo-
Tonic Pills, and suggested that I should give
them a trial. ‘ Very well,’ I said, ‘I will, but I
don’t think they can possibly affect the pimples,
which seem to have settled down for good and all
upon my face.’ I took the pills according to
directions. After twenty-four hours the pimples
began to dry up, and in forty-eight hours they all
came away when I was washing, leaving the skin
perfectly clear and clean like the rest of my face.
For two months these pimples worried me. Two
days of Laxo-Tonic treatment and they were
clean gone.”

On Farm and Station
Zam-Buk is Invaluable.
Y,v,
r
r
Busy workers on farm and station
are ever liable to painful cuts,
knocks, grazes, bruises, contusions,
abrasions, burns, and numerous other
everyday mishaps. It may be at the
plough, on the sheep-run or the cattle-
station, in the workshop or
during ‘ ‘ branding ” operations,
whilst splitting or fencing,
or in the homestead itself,
the hands receive nasty
knocks, and the body and legs
painful bruises, which require
immediate care and treatment.
This can be done by keeping
handy a pot of Zam-Buk,
the world’s one great and
only perfect healing Balm.
Promptly dressing an injury
with Zam-Buk means speedy
relief from smarting pain—
that your wound will heal up
quickly and perfectly, with-
out festering 1 , without gathering, and without harboring disease germs.
Zam-Buk is as necessary in station use as a lamb-marker’s knife.
A Station-Hand’s Praise.
“Whilst following my work on a cattle-station,” says Mr. T. Hallam, of Litwyche
Road, Brisbane, “I have used Zam-Buk with never-failing benefit for many kinds of
knocks, bruises, sprains, as well as a slight attack of eczema, which trouble it completely
cured after three applications. Owing to a sudden jolt I recently wrenched my neck,
twisting the sinews, which gave me so much pain that I could not lie down. I rubbed
the balm well into my neck, and a few applications soon put it right. lam never
without a pot of this precious healer, and always recommend it.”
Zam-Buk is Nature’s Own Healer and Skin-Cure for Cuts, Burns,
Grazes, Bruises, Scalds, Pimples, Eczema, Piles, Psoriasis, Barber's Rash, Sore Feet,
Heat Sores, Summer Skin Troubles, and all skin injuries and diseases. 1/6 and 3/6 per
pot, of all Chemists
and Stores (3/6 size
contains nearly 4
times the 1/6), or

The Pursuit of Ignorance.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IT’S a singular world ! lam frequently hurled
To the depths of poetic despair
Because I cannot retain in my singular brain
Simple facts. (Facts are things I can’t bear !)
And I’m always in doubt while I’m sorting them
out —
For I’m told I must keep some on hand.
Yes, the truth must be faced —we’re by Know-
ledge laid waste,
There's no Ignorance left in the land !
Tho’ the schoolmasters hiss when you tell them it’s
bliss,
And professors have fits on the floor.
Still I stoutly maintain that the infantile brain
Should be littered with knowledge no more ;
You start learning your facts and commandments
and acts
Ere the wetnurse has gone from your bed,
And you’re pegging away when you’re withered
and grey,
And before you’re half finished you’re dead !
Let the word go around, Ignorance may be found
Sitting down in a cave or a grot.
And professors alarmed, with arithmetics armed,
Hurry off in a band for the spot.
Before Ignorance knows if they’re friends or
they’re foes,
He is down in the midst of the throng
With a sum on two slates, and a pencil that grates,
And a furious chorus of “ Wrong ! ”
When an innocent child, I was often reviled
For not knowing some king’s pedigree,
And I suffered one day when I ventured to say
That a dead king was nothing to me ;
Then one day I was thrashed when I said I’d be
dashed
If I’d learn about Harry the Fat
And his little affairs on the palace back-stairs—
And old out-of-date gossip like that.
T have noticed with pain that the teachers who
stain
Their good records again and again,
By repeating such “truths ” to small, goggle-eyed
youths,
Are all very respectable men,
And it makes me feel glad that I long ago had
The ambition to be a great fool,
And as I ne’er swerved from that goal I pre-
served
All my ignorance safe while at school.
A professor once said by the shape of my head—
(Which they tell me encloses the brain) —
I must know quite a lot, but I said “ Tommyrot!
Don’t you dare to repeat that again !
All my life I have tried to put knowledge aside ! ”
And he seemed both enraged and surprised,
And he yelled, “ You’re a clam ! ” I replied, “ If
I am
My ambition has been realised ! ”
Then I said, “If you please, why did Diogenes
(That’s the person who lived in the tub)
When alone in the dark with his conscience
remark
To himself, * Ah, my boy, there's the rub !’ ? ”
The professor so cool said, “ That’s Hamlet, you
fool! ”
I replied, “ Goodness me, is that so? ”
Then I cried in delight, “If I’d chanced to be
right,
I’d have felt most degraded and low.”
The professor, enraged, said, “ For years I’ve
engaged
In absorbing all civilised lore,
And I’ve learnt ev’rything you can talk, write or
sing,
But you're something I’ve not met before ;
By the plain common rules for the gauging of fools,
You’re the biggest in all historee.”
I replied, in a glow, “ You are good to say so !
This is a proud moment for me ! ”
“ Oh, you won’t be allowed,” then, he yelled, “to
be proud.
Ignorance is a thing we can’t bear !
And we simply won’t stand having fools in the
land
Going round with loose straws in their hair !
You’ll be taught by main force where the Thames
has its source.
And the date of the birth of King John,
And to parse and to add. Oh! we'll teach you,
my lad! ”
And I said to him, “Really ! Go on ! ”
Then I said, “ Pray attend, my unfortunate
friend.
Now you’ve wasted the years of your youth,
And your looks and your sight, sitting learning at
night—
Let me tell you the Beautiful Truth !
And the Truth is just this : Lack of knowledge is
bliss.
Why ! you’ve got it down there in your book ! ”
Then he turned in a rage to discover the page,
And his hands unaccountably shook.
“ You were born,” then I said, “ with no facts in
your head —
Just a beautiful, ignorant child.
You were happy until they all started to fill
You with facts. Then—by Knowledge defiled —
You grew solemn and sad, and perhaps you grew
bad.
Now this country has reached such a pass
That philosophers say one may go a whole day
Without meeting a (qualified) ass ! ”
Then he rose from his book with a horrified look,
And his mortarboard fell in the mire,
And he cried, “ Have I yet enough time to forget
What I’ve learnt —for that’s my desire ?”
And I said, “ Well, you know if you’ll let yourself
g°—
Also, make it a very strict rule
Not to think or talk sense, but to howl on a
fence —
In due course you’ll become a great fool.”
Straight he shouted with joy, “I am with you,
my boy ! ”
And he flung his cap into the air
And it stuck in a tree. Then he danced around me,
And I gave him some straws for his hair ;
Now together we sing in the beautiful Spring
And grow splendidly foolish and fat,
While a ruffled old owl—an inebriate fowl
Lays large families up in his hat.
N.S.W.
KODAK.
At St. Job’s Chambers.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I WAS in trouble at my bash-tower ; and
as it was about the sixth turret that I had
felt called upon to leave suddenly, I deter-
mined to give residential chambers a trial. I took
up my quarters in an hotel till my aunt, who
always chooses my residences for me, had time to
look round.
She fixed upon St. Job’s Chambers, the big
eight-storeved pile that overlooks the Rose
Gardens. It is not beautiful, but the lack of
artistic lines is somewhat compensated by the
fact that it is as clean and fresh as frequent paint-
ings can keep it. Also, the man who had the
contract for tiling the floors was an artist, and Ins
admixture of warm siennas and bright blues is
very charming. The brightness and superfine
quality of the N.S.W. marble of which the stair-
case is made is another alleviation, and the lift is
a model of comfort and convenience.
The chambers were built by the Church of the
same name on land included in the original endow-
ment of the sanctuary, and are really run by the
vestry, per medium of a sharp caretaker, as a com-
mercial investment. The bottom floors are used
as offices, the upper ones let well as “residential
flats.” The advertisements state that they afford
charming homes for married couples and single
gentlemen; and that maiden ladies and children
are not admitted.
It was the last portion of the advertisement
that caught aunt’s eye. She investigated at once,
and about two hours later her sweet old face,
made even softer by the sprig of heliotrope in her
bonnet, appeared at the office door.
She knows I am fond of an elevation and cannot
live without an outlook, but I began to think she
had overdone it when the lift sprang wildly about
200 ft. and the attendant said :
“ Top floor, lydy !”
My aunt led the way into some very tastefully
furnished rooms that opened out on to a balcony.
From the balcony access could be gained to
several acres of roof. You reached them by
ladders. Of these ladders more anon.
The outlook was charming, and at the altitude
the noise of the city was quite inaudible ; in fact,
the silence was almost oppressive.
“It’s rather high up, considering that the lift
only works from nine till six ; but there are no un-
married women here, and therefore no chance of
your getting entangled in the disgraceful manner
you did at that dreadful boarding-house,” said my
aunt, with a sigh. Then she poked round the
room a little while, altered the position of various
ornaments, tried the mantelpiece with her finger
for traces of dust, and cast a critical eye round the
bedroom.
•* ■* » *
In spite of the comfort of the rooms, I came
home to St. Job’s with a depressed feeling. The
atmosphere of strict propriety was chilling. My
first night was horrible —I made it as short as pos-
sible by coming home at 2.30 a.m., and I arose in
the morning determined that, by hook or by crook,
I would get out of the place without offending my
aunt. But, as I hunted round for the bathroom,
I discovered that the place simply swarmed with
bright-eyed young women ; and, when I had been
there three days, I realised that if they all had
husbands they carefully kept them out of harm’s
way. Most of them, I discovered, lived in single
rooms, and occasional glances through half-open
doors revealed the fact that these rooms had
nothing like the conveniences and comforts of my
own. There were three rooms in my flat. One I
used as a dining-room. The other was—well, I sup-
pose you’d call it a study. I smoked and worked
there. The third was an enormous room, fitted
with three huge wardrobes, a couple of carved
pieces of furniture that were really chests of
drawers in disguise, and a full-length swing
mirror. An acre of bed was hidden away behind
a rampart of Japanese screens, across which
golden geese flew over amethyst waters into a
scarlet sunset.
The reason for all this luxury was that the
apartments had just been vacated by a beauty
actor, who had lighted out suddenly for
parts unknown, and had left his furniture
and his unpaid rent in his haste. As I
had only four suits altogether, I could have
done with a carpet-bag instead of three
wardrobes. But they imparted an atmosphere
of affluence to the place that made me feel
good, and the gleam and glitter of the bevelled
plate-glass doors brightened my nights consider-
ably.
* * * *
I had just finished dinner the third night of my
abode when there came a light tap at the door. I
said something encouraging, and a vision with
soft blue eyes, a large pink mouth, and delightfully
bright teeth floated in. I was staggered to observe
that she was wearing a wrapper, and carrying an
evening dress over her arm.
“Excuse me,” she said, with a heavenly smile,
“but would you mind if I dressed in your bed-
room—the full-length mirror is so useful, you
know. I used to have the use of it till you took
the flat. Now I find it very awkward. You
won’t mind, will you ? ”
“Oh —er—certainly not. Come in any time
you like, and make yourself at home. You know
the way ?”
She disappeared through the door. In about
half an hour she emerged, arrayed in a Y bodice
with cornflowers along the corsage, and in her
brown hair. She also wore a blue silk skirt.
“ Thanks so much ! ” she nodded nonchalantly.
“Hope I haven’t inconvenienced you. Do you
mind if I get the caretaker’s key any time you are
out?”
“Not at all—get the key any time you like, and
stay just as long as you like.”
She flashed her teeth and disappeared.
Then I went into the room to change my smok-
ing jacket —my aunt buys this sort of tommy-rot
for me, and is hurt if they show no signs of being
worn. Around the mirror were little specks of
powder, and a curious perfume haunted the
atmosphere. It would be awkward if my aunt
came in. Her husband had left her a commodious
fortune when he crossed over, and it had been
accumulating ever since ; so I had more than sen-
timental reasons for not wishing to offend her.
Therefore I mopped up the powder with a

Weak Kidneys, Bladder and Liver Troubles,
Rheumatism, Gout, Lame Back, Gravel, Bright's
Disease, Diabetes, and nearly all the Ills of Men
and Women can be traced to the Kidneys.
A SYDNEY MAN
OWES HIS LIFE TO DOAN’S PILLS.
Mr. P. Smith, 1 Cheltenham Street, Balmain, Sydney, says “I used.
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills for kidney trouble, and they worked a
miracle in my case. I had been under three doctors at different times, but
their treatment did me no good. I used to be so bad that I would have to
be carried home on a cart, if an attack came on when working in the street.
Sometimes I have been taken to the hospital when one of these bad attacks
came on. My wife says she thought that I would never live through some
of these bad turns. I suffered with a kind of biliousness and vomiting.
My secretions were very bad, I could never bend my back or move at all
when I had a bad turn. The people at the hospital gave me medicines,
and recommended rubbing in liniments, but it was of no use, they did not
benefit me. I saw an advertisement for Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills,
and procured this remedy. I only took one box and was cured. When I
finished them I started work, and have worked ever since. It is heavy
work lam doing, but it does not affect me. These pills cured me after
years of suffering, and the relief was almost instantaneous.”
Mrs. Smith confirms the above nine years later : “My husband has
had wonderful health since he used Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills. He
is so well now. lam convinced that he owes his life to this remedy.”
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills are sold by all Chemists and Storekeepers
at 2/9 per box (six boxes, 15/3), or will be posted on receipt of price by

ECZEMA CURED.
Mr. H. Watson, 3 Alfred Street,
Annandale, Sydney, says:—“A couple
of years ago I had Eczema break out
very badly on my chest. It was shortly
after I returned from a trip to India,
where I had gone with horses. I had
fever badly in India, and the Eczema
seemed to be the result of this sickness,
It was very severe, and spread rapidly,
until I was in such a state that the pain
and irritation nearly drove me mad.
When I went to bed at night my suffer-
ings were worse, and it was nearly morn-
ing before I could get to sleep. A man
I know advised me to get Doan’s Oint-
ment, saying that he had heard of great
results by using this preparation. I
thought it a good idea, and obtained
a pot. The first application was cooling,
and the second soothed the itch, and j
after that I got along splendidly. Every |
time I applied the ointment there was a
marked improvement, until I was quite
cured. Within a month from the first
time I used the ointment not one trace
of the ailment remained. Doan’s Oint-
ment is a splendid preparation for
Eczema, skin irritation, to take inflam-
mation from the skin, and to heal.”
Four years later Mr. Watson says :
“ It is a long time since Doan’s Ointment
cured me of Eczema, and I am pleased to
say that the cure is permanent. lam
quite free of this dreadful complaint, and
have been during the past four years.”
The most obstinate of all skin diseases
- —Eczema —is permanently cured by the
great skin remedy, Doan’s Ointment.
Doan’s Ointment is sold by all chemists
and storekeepers at 2/9 per pot, or will
be posted on receipt of price by Foster-
McClellan Co., 76 Pitt Street, Sydney.

handkerchief, and, lighting a cigar, eliminated
the subtle perfume.
I was interrupted by a faint knock. Before
I could leave the bedroom I heard a soft voice
inquire :
“May I come in ? ”
“Bight in ! ” I said cheerfully, thinking it was
the Lady of the Teeth come back.
This time it was a little dark one, with jetty
hair and eyes of highly-polished agate. She was
dressed in a coat and skirt, and a bow of amber-
tinted ribbon at her turn-down collar gave a
slightly Asiatic expression to her dark skin.
She smiled affably, and placed a carry-all on the
table.
“ You’ll think me awfully bold, but before you
came I used to keep all my pretty things in the
big wardrobe. I hear you only use one of them,
and I thought if I got in early you might let me
use one of the others. All the girls in the building
are going to ask you to let them keep their best
frocks in your wardrobes. So I thought I’d get
in early. Do you mind ? ”
“Come in and I’ll help you to stow them,” I
replied cheerfully. For I was beginning to like
this little idiosyncrasy of St. Job’s.
“Now which one would you like ?” I inquired
when we got into the room, and I had lit all the
gas jets, of which there were four. She gave a
little squeal of delight.
“Oh, you are good! I’ll have the big carved
one. I can hang up my frocks there, and lay my
bodices in the big long drawer. You are good.”
“I’d do anything in the world for you,” I said.
“Oh, yes, and I can put my evening shoes in
that little side cupboard, where Beauty used to
keep the liqueurs,” she went on enthusiastically.
“What sort of a fellow was Beauty?” I in-
quired as I undid the straps of the carry-all.
“ Oh, awfully nice. He used to have us all up
to suppers here, and then we used to smoke out on
the roof till all hours. Pity he mizzled ! ”
“ What did he mizzle for?”—taking the lid off
the carry-all.
She sighed and lifted out a bodice of crushed
strawberry tint:
“Oh, the usual thing. Some fellows chasing
him with guns and others with writs. I wouldn’t
marry a jealous man for anything in this wide
world.”
“I say,” I suddenly ejaculated, “do you think
your hubby would snort if he came up here to see
where you had got to?”
“ Who ? I ! I haven’t got a husband. I’m not
married ! ”
“ But I thought only married couples and single
gentlemen could get in here?”
“Oh, that’s all fudge. Three-parts of the rooms
are let to unmarried girls. You just sign the book
as Mrs. and get your receipts made out to Mrs.
and it’s all right. You know the Church owns
this shop, and they’ve got to look particular.”
“I see,” I said, with a great breath of relief,
smoothing out a diaphanous skirt before hanging
it up.
When the carry-all was empty I suggested that
she should show me over the roof.
“ You’ll have to lift me up on to the parapet
then, and I’m heavy as lead,” she remarked,
dubiously. “We go out at that window —point-
ing to the other side of the room.
I lifted her on the sill, and then scrambled up
beside her.
“Now flop down there, and I’ll step from your
shoulder on to the parapet. Put your handker-
chief on your shoulder to save your coat from the
mark of my shoe. Right, that’s it. Now up you
come.”
“ Hold on ; there’s somebody in my dining-
room. Will you wait ? ”
“All right; shunt them quickly, and don’t be
long. It’s some more of them after the ward-
robes, I ’spect.”
I went back to the dining-room, and nearly
fainted. It was my aunt.
“I haven’t a moment, but as I was passing I
just crawled up to see if you were comfortable.
Those stairs would kill me in a week,” she gasped,
sinking into a wicker chair and fanning herself
vigorously with a religious periodical.
Under my breath I thanked my stars that the
lift didn’t work after six.
“ Are you comfy ? ” she inquired, when she
got her breath.
“Oh, splendid. When I get up here I don’t
feel inclined to go out again, and just settle down
and read on the roof.”
“On the roof ! ” she gasped. “Be careful; you
might roll off. However do you see ? ”
This was a poser, but I pulled myself together.
“ Oh, I just read outside the window, and when
I want to get the breeze, go higher up.”
“But isn’t it very dangerous? Just let me have
a peep.”
“No, no, aunt; you could not climb up there.”
“I, know, but you can show me from the bal-
cony ” ; and she stepped to the window that gave
access to it. My heart sank. I followed her out,
and as I went I heard a scuffling. My aunt
stepped back, aghast.
“ There’s a creature out there,” she gasped, in a
horrified tone.
“Impossible! Let me see ! ”
But the girl was all grit.
“ Anybody inside ? ” she called, plaintively.
“ Yes, what’s up—who’s there ? ” I inquired in
as shocked a voice as I could assume.
“It’s Nancy, the maid,” came the voice.
“Somebody locked the window while I was
watering the plants on the roof garden, and I’ve
had to climb down here. Will you please lift me
down, Sir ? ”
“What a shame!” ejaculated my aunt. “I
think it’s disgraceful to expect girls to climb over
roofs like monkeys. I shall certainly write to
Mrs. Salt about it in the morning. Lift the poor
girl down, and be careful you don’t fall.”
“ You’re a brick !” I whispered as I lifted her
down and helped her through the window.
She replied by pinching my ear.
Then aunt decided that she would have some
tea, and as I went to ask for it my blood turned
suddenly cold. That cursed carry-all was in the
bedroom, and through the open door of the ward-
robe a whole trousseau would stare the old lady in
the face if she looked into the room, which I felt
certain she would. Hastily ordering some tea, I
hurried back, dived into the bedroom, closed the
door of the wardrobe, kicked the carry-all under
the bed, turned off the gas, and rushed out to
where the old lady was still fanning herself with
the Home Missions, or something like that.
While she sipped her tea it boomed nine. She
arose with a start. She must be going at once.
Caroline would think she had met with an acci-
dent. I agreed, and started to accompany her
down the stairs. I breathed a lot more freely
when I closed the big front door behind her.
I waited long enough to give her a fair'start,
and then I sallied out to order some supper. That
girl with the agate eyes was a good sort, and from
the way she pinched my ear, I felt certain she
would return.
Sure enough, when I got back she was sitting in
the dining-room.
“That was a narrow shave. We must get
some keys for that wardrobe in case she comes up
some day and does a little bit of exploring. Is she
your mamma?”
“Oh, no; iny aunt. I’m her heir.”
The girl whistled. “ Mustn’t take any risks,
Shall we go out on the roof ? ”
“Yes, I’ve ordered some supper. Oysters,
chicken, French salad, and some Chablis; and
we’ll go out and have a smoke till it comes.”
That time we carted some cushions with us.
It was delightful out under the stars. Below
us the Rose Gardens, all glittering with the great
electric globes, looked like a picture from the
Arabian Nights. The girl with the agate eyes
sang little snatches of love songs between pulfs at
her cigarette. We heard the men bring the
supper, and shouted directions. There was a
rattle of knives, forks and plates, and a clink of
glasses, and then a deep voice inquired did we
know there was a big cairngorm brooch on the
floor.
I came down, and found my aunt’s most valued
possession in the hand of Demetrius Phriedphish.
I gave him half-a-crown, and slipped the thing
into my pocket. As I was already down the girl
came too, and we fell on the supper.
It was a nice supper, and the girl was a wit of
the first order. We laughed and sang, and the
girl did a neat skirt dance, and just as we were
finishing the Lady of the Teeth came back, wear-
ing her wrapper. Did I mind if she hung her
evening costume in my wardrobe ?
I didn’t mind anything.
“Seems I’ve arrived too late,” she said, flashing
her teeth.
Not at all. There are several things un-
touched. We’re going out on the roof again, so
sit down and enjoy yourself.” And then I
scrambled out once more on to the roof, where, like
a fool, I tried to sing duets with the agate-eyed
girl. When we glanced down through the window
we saw the girl with the teeth demolishing all
that was left of the chicken, and eating the wreck
of the salad out of the bowl with one hand, while
she balanced a glass of sparkling wine in the other.
The stars were blinking, and the agate-eyed girl’s
head had slipped down on to my shoulder, while
we warbled in a sort of a fashion, “Farewell,
Leonore.’ Then there was a sudden exclama-
tion, a suppressed scream from the girl with the
teeth, and my aunt’s voice ordered a “brazen
creature to leave her nephew’s apartments at
once. Before we could move aunt was on the
balcony regarding us with a look of awful, out-
raged propriety.
She addressed me by my full name, and pre-
ceded it with “ Mister.”
“If you can spare the time I would be obliged
if you would come down and ascertain if my cairn-
gorm brooch is about your rooms. I have lost it
and thought it might be there. I hope I do not
disturb you too much.”
“Certainly, aunt—yes, that is, I’ve got it all
right. Here it is. I’ll bring it down now.”
As I scrambled down I saw Caroline standing
behind aunt wearing a most shocked expression.
The lights were burning in the bedroom, both
wardrobe doors were wide open, and the dresses
looked like a shattered rainbow piled inside.
Caroline’s eyes were glued on them.
“I was bringing it up first thing in the morn-
ing, aunt. How do you do, Carry ? ”
“ Pardon me, please do not presume to address
Caroline. Judging by the appearances of your
wardrobes you have quite enough lady friends to
make it unnecessary that you should trouble to
know either Caroline or myself again. Good
evening. I’m sorry to have disturbed you. Miss
Nancy, the maid, I believe, awaits you on the
roof. Good evening, Mr. .”
Then they went out.
I went back to the roof.
“What are you going to do now?’’said the
agate-eyed girl anxiously.
“ Work all my life ! ” I groaned.

The Children of the Wilderness.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
BACK from snaring wallabies, back from
falling scrub,
Back from where there’s not yet come
parson, rail or pub ;
Back from fencing, droving, sinking wells and
cutting cane,
From island beach and jungle, from mountain
peak and plain,
From winding at the windlass, and delving in the
shaft,
And cruising round the Barrier in cranky pearling
craft.
We’ve done our toil, and pouched a cheque which
has to be knocked down,
So the Children of the Wilderness have come to
Sydney town.
Oh, Sydney beer makes glad the heart, and
Sydney girls are kind,
And Sydney fare is better than the fare we’ve left
behind.
It’s good to ride in cab and car and ferry-boat and
train,
And it’s good to see humanity in masses once
again.
To take a walk at leisure through the bustling,
bright-hued street,
And observe and speculate upon the people that
we meet.
The Hebes of the wineshops and Salomes of the
stage
Gladden eyes that haven’t seen a pretty woman
for an age.
The burden Adam left us for a space is cast aside,
And we’ve taken rosy Pleasure for a temporary
bride.
Ah, sable-coated moralist, I fear you sometimes
frown
At the antics of the Children of the Wilderness in
town.
Oh, Sydney is the town to seek when man desires
a flutter;
But its far from Sydney we must go to earn our
bread and butter.
We’ve said good-bye to Kate and Fan and held a
final revel,
We’ve shed our city clothes and sent bad habits to
the Devil.
By boat and boot and bicycle, by saddle, coach
and train,
The Children of the Wilderness are homeward
bound again.

Familiar Quotations
pregnant with meaning are being handed down from one generation to
another. Many examples might be quoted, and their applicability to the
subject of health noted. For example, “Forewarned is forearmed.”
Directly symptoms of a disordered Stomach appear, that is “the warning,”
and all the “arming” that is necessary is a box of Beecham’s Pills.
“A stitch in time saves nine.” Beecham’s Pills will quickly arrest any
disposition to Stomach, Liver, or Kidney trouble.
“Worth a Guinea a Box”
This is another familiar quotation but applying specially to Beecham’s
Pills. These enjoy a popularity that can be claimed by no other
preparation: and the last named expression has become proverbial
because thousands of people all over theT world have benefitted by the
use of the medicine to which it refers. For really buoyant health—free-
dom from ache or pain—a system attuned alike to work or pleasure—take
Beechams Pills.
