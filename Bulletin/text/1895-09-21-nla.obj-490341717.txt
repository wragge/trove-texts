OF OMAR KHAYYAM.
The announcement that George Meredith
ottered his maiden speech at the last meeting of
the Omar Khayyam club, awoke (it is to be feared)
in few Australian bosoms a responsive thrill.
Conan Doyle we know, and Anthony Hope ;
of “Ships that Pass” and “Trilby” we can
prattle with assurance; but George Meredith,
“ the greatest living master of English fiction ” —
how rare his disciples in the booksellers’ flock !
As for Omar Khayyam—ask for him at the
counter, and observe the more than Egyptian
darkness which shrouds the bland assistant’s
phiz ! Yet among all the guides, philosophers
and friends that Man has vouchsafed unto men—
not forgetting Solomon, and his brother Ecclesi-
astes, and his cousin Ecclesiasticus (a most admir-
able-foolish cuss); not forgetting Horace, and
Sterne, and Montaigne, and the grave Antoninus
—there is none like unto Omar—none !
Meredith is “ tough ” —to the flippant literary
slap-dasher. Maybe. So is Henry George (not his
sentences, but his ideas). Yet you will meet more
than one enthusiastic Single - taxer who has
assimilated “Progress and Poverty” as thoroughly
as a Plymouth Brother his Bible. What saith
(with emphatic inversion) the Scriptures : “ Unto
whomsoever much is given, of him shall be much
required.” And Meredith gives more than he
requires by 90 times 9—and ever so many ciphers.
The book to begin on. of course, is “The,Ordeal
of Richard Feverel,” which most appeases the
hunger for plots—and chapters 15 and 20 may
be dipped into by way of foretaste. Anyone then
who gets no farther, deserves not to —which is a
cruel thing to say, but quite fair in the circum-
stances.
Omar is another matter (Khayyam—“the tent-
maker ” —is a tagged poetical pen-name, like —a
suitable modern parallel that won’t come to mind).
Money cannot really be measured against Fitz-
gerald’s Omar—practically the only one worth
knowing ; but, commercially speaking, there is no
“cheap’ edition (the least price is 11s. posted;
and Eli Vender's famous illustrations run his
edition up to anything over £o 5s.), so that the
book is better not bought if anywhere, from any-
body,, you can borrow a copy and learn it by heart
—there are only 101 stanzas in the latest version.
Only 101 stanzas—begotten of Omar, conceived
and born of Fitzgerald, with the wit and wisdom
tain fully gathered by a million philosophers of
last and \V est inherited and distilled in their
fragrance! And the essence of all is
Carpe Diem !
“ Go thy way, eat thy bread with joy, and drink
thy wine with a merry heart. Let thy garments
be always white; and let thy head lack no oint-
ment. Live joyfully with the wife whom thou
lovest all the days of this vanity—thy life.”
A Book of _Verses underneath the Bough,
A**Jug of Wine, a Loaf of Bread— and Thou
Beside me singing ip the. Wilderness—
Oh, Wilderness were Paradise "enow !
.Ijjfvery j!)piaj][§t Iris his verse_ ip &-
gefald s exquisite metre. Here is one (spoken by
a “ shape of clay in the “ Potter’s house ”) :
“ W ell. murmured one, “ leT whoso make or buy.
My Clay with long Oblivion is gone dry:
But fill me with the old familiar Juice,
I might recover by and by ! "
Another j—
And much as Wine has play’d the Infidel,
And robb'd me of my Robe of Honour —Well,
I wonder often what the Vjntners buy
One-half so precious as Ihe stuff they sell.
Others :—
I must abjure the Balm of Life, I must,
Scared by some After-reckoning ta’en on trust,
Or lured with hope of some Diviner Drink,
To fill the Gup—when crumbled into Dust I
Oh threats of Hell and Hopes of Paradise !
One thing at least is certain —This Life flies ;
One thing is certain and is Lies;
The Flower that once has blown for ever dies.
Strange, is it not ? that of the myriads who
Before us pass’d the door of Darkness through,
Not one returns to tell us of the Road,
Which to discover we must travel too.
I sent my Soul through the Invisible,
Some letter of that After-iife to spell:
And by and by my Soul return’d to me,
And answer’d “ I Myself am Heav’n and Hell: ”
Heav’u but the Vision of fulfill’d Desire,
And Hell the Shadow from a Soul on fire,
Cast on the Darkness into which Ourselves
So late emerged from, shall so soon expire.
Best of all : —
Some for the Glories of This World ; and some
Sigh for the Prophet’s Paradise to come ;
Ah, take the Cash, and let the Credit go,
Nor heed the rumble of a distant Drum!
PERIODICALS.
With the excellent Aug. number, Pall Mall
Magazine raises its price Gd. (now 2s. sd. posted).
It has Jong been obvious that this, the most sump-
tuous of English •magazines, must be printed
at a loss, in spite of its fine array of advts. Pro-
bably the circulation in England, whei - e its patrons
belong to a class which does not value incidental
sixpences, will be unaffected by the change ; but
the Australian sale is likely to decrease. So many
good books are obtainable at 2s. or 2s. Gd. that the
Pall Mall, still splendid value, goes down con-
siderably in the scale of comparative value ; and
the Australian buyer, though he never grudges
his money, always wants to make the best bargain
possible.
The Aug. English Illustrated (lid.) is a
specially good number of a specially good maga-
zine. A tale —“ With Madness in his Method ”
a charming example of the lighter American style
—and the continuation of Weyman’s “Memoirs
of a Minister of France,” plead for space-forbidden
comment ; and one illustration, “Dawn,” is the
prettiest anywhere to be seen this month.
The July Englishwoman (lid.) is well-varied
and readable. The best story is Richard Pryce’s
“ Book of the Curl.” Frankfort Moore gives
another glimpse of that remarkable country,
English - Australia.
The Album for July 15 (Bd.) cannot be too
highly praised. The illustrations are exquisite,
Krticularly those which depict the beautiful
ames from Oxford to Hampton Court. This
weekly is well worth a continuous subscription
(15s. Gd. per half-year).
The July Yellow Book (6s. 6d.) doesn’t reach
previous standards; it has less originality, less
literary value. There are one or two good pic-
tures ; the verse (with the exception of a trans-
lation from the Portuguese) is dim and echo-y;
only two stories can be called good—“ in an
American Newspaper Office,” and “A New
Poster.” Kenneth Grahame’s “ Long Odds ” is a
clever and suggestive paper.
The July Foedm (37s. per annum) has a par-
ticularly good article by Frederic Harrison on
“Charles Kingsley’s Place in Literature”—the
eighth of a splendid series which will be well
worth buying when republished. Harrison is a
better critic than Saintsbury ; and no less pleasant
a writer.
SOME RECENT BOOKS.
“ Australian Zoology,” by G. Metcalfe, M.A., a
N.S.W. State school-teacher, is published by E.
W. Cole at Is. 3d. (posted), and is heartily recom-
mended as a most interesting book, worthy a
much better dress. Mainly, of course, it is com-
pilation ; but the work is exceedingly well done,
and the little volume should be bought by every-
one interested in Australian birds, beasts and
fishes.
Gunsberg’s just-published “Chess Openings”
(Is. 3d.) is a very good little manual, with the
great advantage of being up-to-date. (Other good
chess books are Green’s general handbook (Is. 3d.);
Staunton’s Hand-book, Praxis, and Chess-player’s
Companion (5s. 6d. each); and Morphy’s Games
(5s. 6d.). A more scientific book is Horwitz and
Kling’s “ Chess Studies and End Games ” (8s. Sd.).
Steinitz’s “Instructor” (11s.), of which only
Part I. is yet published, is the completest so far
as it goes.)
“ Almayer’s Folly ” (paper, 3s.; cloth, 4s.), by
Joseph Conrad, is a powerful tale of life in Borneo
which has been rather over-praised by the English
press—always grateful to the writer who exploits
a new milieu. The central idea is the straggle
between civilised and barbaric instincts in a half-
white, half-yellow girl; and her Dutch father’s
broken heart when barbarism triumphs and she
rushes to the arms of a Malay lover, is the last
drop in a cup of tragic life-failure.
Percy Fitzgerald supplies a gossipy, readable
“Life of Henry Irving” (paper, Is. 3d. ; cloth,
Is. lOd.)
“ The Cult of Beaut}*, a manual of personal
hygiene ” (3s.), by 0. S. Thompson, is an elegantly-
gotten-up little book, for which any lover would
deserve the thanks of his lady.

NOTEB.
Alex. Lindsay is issuing an “ Australander
series ”.(ls. 3d.), to include new books by favorite
Australian authors. The first number, “His
Native Wife,” by Louis Becke, will bo out in three
or four weeks.
Booksellers find Morris’s “Life of Higin-
botham ” very dead stock. The life of a democrat
should certainly be published at a more demo-
cratic price than 9s. Bd. (posted).
The late Sir James Stephen put a familiar life-
philosophy in some lines quoted by his biographer-
brother Leslie:
The know-nothing books may alarm you ; but
many a better man
Knows he knows nothing and says so, and lives
the best life he can.
If there is a future state, face its hopes and terrors
gravely;
The best path to it must be to bear life’s burthens
bravely.
And even if there be none, why should you not
live Hire a man,
Enjoying whatever you have as much and as long
as you can ? ”
Melb. and Sydney retailers complain bitterly of
the ladies—generally related to most influential
personages—who get parcels of new books sent
home ‘ r on appro.,” and return them after any
time from two months to two years ; when ? of
course, they are quite unsaleable. “My relation,
Sir Blank Blank,” covers a multitude of book-
lenders’ curses.
New volumes in the pretty pocket edition of
Chas. Kingsley (Is. lOd. each) are the “ Poems ”
and “Alton Locke.”
Mis j Wilkins, a writer of charming American
village tales, has won the Chapman’s Magazine
first prize of =£loo for a short detective tale, “ The
Long Arm.” Brander Matthews, another Ameri-
can, came second among 3000 competitors.
Some Books Worth Heading.
This list is eclectic, not comprehensive;

COUGHS, COLDS ON THE CHEST, BRON-
CHITIS AND ASTHMA RAPIDLY
CURED BY Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure.
Those who have taken this medicine are amazed
at its wonderful influence. Sufferers from any
form of bronchitis, distressing cough, difficulty of
breathing, hoarseness, pain or soreness in the
chest, experience delightful and immediate relief,
and to those who are subject to colds on the chest
it is invaluable, as it effects a complete cure. It
is most comforting in allaying tickling and irrita-
tion in the throat, and giving strength to the voice,
and it never allows a cough or asthma to become
chronic. No house should be without it, as, taken
at the beginning, a dose is generally sufficient,
and a complete cure is certain.
“We, theundersigned.have had occasion toobtain
HEARNE’S BRONCHITIS CURE,
and we certify that it is perfectly and rapidly suc-
cessful under circumstances which undoubtedly
prove its distinct healing power.” Signed by
Rev. JOHN SINCLAIR, Myers-street, Geelong,
and 69 other leading residents.
“Mr. W. G. Hearne,
“ Dear Sir, —Some months ago my little boy gob
very ill with bronchitis. My wife heard of your
Bronchitis Cure and got a bottle of it. The first
dose eased him, and less than half the bottle com-
pletely cured him. We always keep it in the
house now. I persuaded a friend of mine to try
it; he did so, and it was just as successful with
his children. You are at liberty to make what
use you like of this, as I consider your Bronchitis
Cure to be a boon that cannot be too widely
known ; in fact, I cannot speak too highly of it.
—Yours very truly, ARTHUR G. JAMES,
Golden Square, Bendigo.
“Dear Sir, —I have much pleasure in informing
you that my father has been improving ever since
he started taking your Bronchitis Cure, and now
all signs of bronchitis have disappeared.—Yours
respectfully, THOS. PAYNE, Junr., Bloomfield,
Everton.”
“Will Mr. Hearne please send a bottle of his
Bronchitis Cure ? I had one two or three months
ago which effected a speedy cure.—J. WYATT,
Newtown, Geelong.”
“Dear Sir, —I had occasion to use your Bron-
chitis Cure, and have been completely cured by
it.—Yours faithfully, J. H. WILLIAMS, Merles-
wood, Elsternwick.”

Who is trebly-qualified, and registered in London
and the Colonies as a Physician and a Surgeon,
received his education in the English and Scottish
universities, and completed bis studies in the lead-
ing hospitals of Europe. He has made a life-long
study of
PRIVATE, NERVOUS Ss SKIN DISEASES.
He has, by diligent research, investigated their
origin and course, and has discovered the quickest
and surest means of thoroughly curing them. He
has, by his unequalled success, during a period of
many years, obtained the highest position in his
profession. The various diseases embraced in his
speciality are those which have hitherto caused
more misery and suffering than any other kind of
trouble that affects the human frame.
Young Men and Those Who
Wish to Marry
who, as the result of early follies, or excesses of
more mature age, suffer from any of the follow-
ing symptoms, namely :—Frequent headaches,
giddiness, drowsiness in the daytime, irregularity
of the bowels, feeling of fullness after eating,
specks before the eyes, halos or circles round a
candle, cold hands and feet, pains in the back or
under the shoulder-blade, tenderness of the breast-
bone on pressure, yellow discharge from the
mouth on to the pillow during sleep, palpitation
of the heart, unpleasant dreams, clammy hands,
an aversion to society, a whitish or cloudy sedi-
ment in the urine after standing, fear of something
dreadful about to happen, impure blood, spots or
pimples on the back, chest, legs, or face, failing
memory, hacking cough, falling of the hair, &c.,
&e., should consult him, for he is now enabled
quickly and effectually, to remove the cause, and
so prevent life-long misery.

ALCOHOLISM.
THIS terrible disease of drink, contracted through
excessive sociability, deprives the best of men
of all respect and reason ; it leads them to acts of
indecency and crime. Alcohol weakens the mind
in subjection to the awful Crave, or morbid desire
for stimulants. The unknown impulse drives the
inebriate to often drink what his palate may even
repel, yet he cannot resist, though he knows him-
self to be drifting to Utter Ruin. At this stage
pledges and punishment prove useless.
The only hope in this condition is to arrest the
crave, eradicate the accumulated alcoholic poison,
and to re-invigorate the nervous and general sys-
tem —to give the subject his self-control and inhi-
bition. Conscious victims —or their friends—
should not delay investigating the marvellous
results achieved by the ORIENT INSTITUTE
for ALCOHOLISM. During the past 18 months
many prominent and valuable men have been
restored to health, Sobriety, and Position in
Life. Inebriates of the most sceptical nature
have been amazed at their restoration.
Cure for Inebriety has been established beyond
all doubt. The U.S. Government has introduced
it into the army, and already numerous States have
legislated for the medical treatment of inebriates.

Q URSELVES!
We wish it to be understood that the character of the
business we do, and the absolutely inclusive variety of the
goods we sell, entitle us to be called
UNIVERSAL PROVIDERS.
We are also not far out, considering the low prices we
ask for everything we sell, and the consequent blessings
we are continually showering upon the people, when we
assert, not in timorous tones, but with the trumpet voice
of confidence in the truth of what we say, when we dub
ourselves
PUBLIC BENEFACTORS.
There are good men in every sphere of life —honest
citizens in every community, whose deeds stamp them
for the approval of their fellow-men, and single them out
from the common herd. Thus we find among the crowd
who aspire to serve their country on the benches of the
Legislative Assembly a patriot here and there who stands
out in bold relief against the majority, whose sole aim
is place and pay. And in commercial life the same thing
occurs, and the same strong contrast between the few
disinterested friends of the people, dnd the many selfish
lookers after the big profits they would like to make, is
plainly apparent. To the former class, to the little band
of merchants who study their customers’ interests, and
who, in self-abnegation and contentedness, are willing to
accept small profits in reward for their services, belong
ANTHONY HORDERN’S.
They say that a good action is its own reward, but if the
good action entail hard work, much tribulation, and con-
tinual strife, then surely the laborer is worthy of his hire,
and the doer of good actions entitled to some recompense
at the hands of those who profit by what he does.
ANTHONY HORDERN’S
neverctase from their toil; in the burden and heat of the
noonday sun they work, oppressed by the cruel frost of
somewhile baffled efforts and frustrated negotiations, they
continue, knowing always that the approval of millions of
souls is theirs. For three-quarters of a century it has
been so, and for a longer time than that it will remain as
it has been. Generations passed away have bought from
the great house, and generations yet to come will do the
same. Like the practice of honesty or truth, there is a
policy in it which brings to its adherents
PROFIT AND SATISFACTION.

APART!
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I stand upon an unknown shore,
And, rolling at my feet
In ebb and flow for evermore,
The unknown waters beat,
And on my brain, in sad refrain,
Their endless tale repeat.
Another lonely islet lies
Amid the waters grey,
Enshrouded by the mists that rise
From out their scattered spray,
And on its rim, far-off and dim,
I see thee wait alway.
Far-off and dim I hear thy cry—
I hear it in despair ;
And unto thee, in anguish, I
Throw out wild hands of prayer—
Vain hands flung wide across the tide
Upon the empty air!
And yet I see to yonder shore
Shall never pathway be;
We live apart for evermore,
And evermore the sea
With mighty deeps between us sweeps—
A stern fatality!
And day shall follow after day,
And moons shall wax and wane,
And winters banish summer’s sway
And melt to Spring again ;
And years go by linked endlessly
In one eternal chain ;
But never shall the trackless deep
Divide or flow apart,
The waters ever round me leap,
Their wail within my heart,
And from their graves beneath the waves
Forbidding ghosts upstart.
And well I know between thy soul
And mine on this lone shore
Unfathomed depths of ocean roll,
Unmeasured waters pour,
And mists arise that blind rny eyes
For ever evermore.

IN TOWN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Out of work and out of money—out of friends that
means, you bet—
Out of firewood, togs and tucker, out of every-
thing but debt,
And I loathe the barren pavements, and the
crowds a fellow meets,
And the maddening repetition of the suffocating
streets.
With their stinks my soul is tainted, and the tang
is on my tongue
Of that sour and smoky suburb and the push
we’re thrown among,
And I sicken at the corners polished free of paint
and mirk
By the shoulders of the men who’re always hang-
ing round for work.
Home—good Lord ! a three-roomed hovel ’twixt a
puddle and a drain,
In harmonious connection on the left with Liver
Lane,
Where a crippled man is dying, and a horde of
children fight,
And a woman in the horrors howls remorsefully
at night.
It has stables close behind it, and an ash-heap for
a lawn,
And is furnished with the tickets of the things we
have in pawn;
And all day the place is haunted by a melancholy
crowd
Who beg everything or borrow, but to steal are
not too proud.
All day, too, come weary women, folk with
famine-haunted eyes,
Hawking things that are not wanted—things that
no one ever buys.
And I hate the prying neighbors, in their animal
content,
And the devilish persistence of the man who
wants the rent.
I, who oared for none, and faltered at no work a
man might do,
Felt a fierce delight take hold me when the trucks
went surging through,
When the flood raced in the sluices, and the giant
gums swang round
’Fore my axe, and flung their mighty limbs all
mangled on the ground—
I who hewed and built and burrowed, and who
asked no man to give
When a strong arm was excuse enough for ven-
turing to live—
I am creeping by the gutters, with a simper and a
smirk,
To the Fates in spats and ’toppers for the privilege
of work.
Far out the hills are all a-flame; the blossom
golden fair
Streams up the gladdened ranges, and its scent is
everywhere,
And the kiddies of the settlers ’long the creek are
red and sweet,
Whilst my youngsters have the sallowness and
savour of the street.
To escape these endless vaults of brick, and pitch
a tent out back,
If I get a chance I’ll graft until my very sinews
crack.
Meanwhile may all the angels up in Paradise look
down
On a man of sin who died not, but was damned
and sent to town !
Melb.

W IMPORTANT NOTICE TO CIGARETTE SMOKERS.
E beg to inform our customers and cigarette smokers generally that the American Tobacco Co.,
. Ltd.,.of N.S.W., who control the sale of cigarettes known under the brands of “ Allen and
Ginter s Straight-cut No. 1,” “Cameo ” and “ Old Judge,” and who manufacture the colonial-made
cigarettes called ‘Pure Gold and “ JDixon’s No. 1,” have given us official notice that they will not
supply us with any of their American-made cigarettes unless we agree to relinquish the agency held by
us for New South Wales for the world-renowned English firm of W, D. and H. O. WILLS, Limited,
the manufacturers of those popular high-class cigarettes known as
“ THREE CASTLES ” and cc C-A-IPST-A-ZEST.”
We have declined to conform with this request, as we feel it would not be to the nterest of
cigarette smokers in New South Wales to allow the American Tobacco Co., Limited, to monopolise
the whole of the cigarette trade. We, therefore, appeal to cigarette smokers to try the celebrated
Wills ’ “Three Castles” and “Capstan,” Cigarettes,
And compare their quality with that of- any other. We are confident that their verdict will be in
favor of the
Three Castles” and “ Capstan” Cigarettes,
And by smoking these they will prevent any one Company from attempting to dictate what people
should or should not smoke.

“ Yankee Doodle , 99 blended with Polities,
The above is, of course, a caricature of the famous American national picture, which will be
given later on.
“YANKEE DOODLE” is everywhere spoken of as the finest plug-tobacco that has ever
appeared here, and it has won greater success during the short time it has been on the market than
anything previously. This is no idle boast, and, to prove it, any smoker can test the statement, for
there are few towns in N.S.W. where “YANKEE DOODLE” is not known and sold. Its sale
has this year increased nearly one hundred (100) per cent over that of last year. And why is this?
Simply that “YANKEE DOODLE” has struck the popular taste. In the first place, it comes, after
years of careful study, from a combination of certain choice Virginian tobaccos, so blended and
exquisitely flavoured, that any smoker who can stand a tobacco heavier than the pure gold-leaf is
forced to admit that he has at last discovered something far and away better than anything he has
been accustomed to. DIXSON & SONS have taken over half-a-century to accomplish this; and, as
their leading business has been built up on their reputation for QUALITY, they could not afford to
make the foregoing statement if any doubt existed. DIXSON & SONS, who use more American leaf
than all the other Tobacco Factories combined, are noted for several high-class brands: —“CON-
QUEROR,” “SIR ROGER,” “CHAMPION,” and “DOLLAR;” but “YANKEE DOODLE”
ranks supreme.

SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 21, 1895.
Praying for Rain.
After a few years of good seasons a period
of drought and fire and barrenness has again
settled down on Southern Queensland, New
South Wales, and other parts of this con-
tinent. Ever since Australia had a history,
and long before it had a history, the drought
has been the most conspicuous feature of its
climate. It comes, doubtless, according to
fixed laws, and when man has learned these
laws he will be able to foretell its coming,
its intensity, area, duration, and everything
else about it. So far, however, he hasn’t
learned them, partly, perhaps, because he
devotes so much time to football, cricket,
horse-racing, organising Chinese missions,
arguing about creeds, splitting hairs of theo-
logy, drinking, and other unintellectual pur-
suits that he lacks the necessary leisure for
studying this most essential subject; there-
fore the drought is still a mystery, and its
arrival and departure are equally unforesee-
able. When the causes of droughts and
floods, dry seasons and wet, are fully dis-
covered, it may quite possibly be found
that man can in part, at least, control the
rainfall, but so far no progress has been
made in this direction. Therefore, the
Government of New South Wales resolved
last week to have recourse to “a day of
humiliation and prayer,” and to ask the
Unknown to put back the universe for
the especial benefit of that province. On
such occasions nine-tenths of the popu-
lation don’t pray, because their belief in
the efficacy of prayer is nil, andraost of
the other tenth prays half-heartedly, not
in person, but per parson, on the assump-
tion that it may do a little good and
it doesn’t seem likely to do any harm. The
said parson, in many cases, frankly acknow-
ledges his belief that prayer for rain is a
foolish attempt to substitute religion for
irrigation and tank-digging, and that the
results to be expected are of the smallest.
And he prays at the direction of a “godless
Government,” which is of opinion that the
average cleric is not fit to be entrusted with
the work of national education, though he is
good enough to bo used for rain-supplication
purposes on an emergency.
• • •
Faith is a thing of curious limitations. The
Australian does not believe in Providence as
a reliable source of moisture. Therefore, he
constructs water-works, tanks, dams, irriga-
tion works, and artesian wells. So far as these
go he recognises that the Unseen won’talterthe
climate of his thirst-cursed land, and that no
amount of devotion will provide a regular
water-supply, so he falls back on the pick
and the spade. But, as he doesn’t make
enough tanksand reservoirs and artesian wells,
and as he lets the surplus waters of good
seasons run to waste, and his irrigation works
are miserably insufficient, and he devotes no
intelligent attention to forest culture as a
means of increasing the rainfall, and is guilty
of neglect in many other shapes he is still
troubled with seasons of awful scarcity. He
takes the drought at first philosophically,
then anxiously, and then in a spirit of despera-
tion, and in this latter stage he appeals to
the Deity and the local member of Parlia-
ment indifferently, on the principle of the
drowning man who catches at a straw. The
Deity is the last resource, and, in his mind,
clearly represents the straw. His belief is
first in his tank, and last of all in Provi-
dence ; if his tank were larger he would not
fall back on Providence at so early a date ;
if it were large enough he would not fall
back on Providence at all. The fact that
he has spent vast sums on boring artesian
wells in the thirsty West is the natural result
of past experience to the effect that Heaven
will not alter climatic conditions at his re-
quest, and that the Western plains being
dry by nature they will remain so unless
their state is altered by hard, manual labor.
The periodical drought is part of the regular
climatic conditions of the country. There-
fore, in asking the shadowy Power, which
he has half-forgotten, and which he less than
half believes in, to arrest the drought before
its time, he asks It to perform a miracle,
while, at the same time, his works express,
in a feeble, unfinished fashion, his convic-
tion that miracles are extinct —if they ever
existed.
• * •
If the thirsty Australian prays for rain it
will come —some day. If he did not pray it
would also come—some day. As no one can
prove that it would or would not in either
case have come on the same day, or on any
other day, the question of the efficacy of
prayer will never be wholly settled. The
droughts which existed in Australia in the
days when the black aboriginal owned the
land and religion had not even been heard
of, came to their natural end without any
request for Divine interposition, and no one
can say that they would have come to an
end sooner under other circumstances. Rain
is not necessarily caused by prayer because
it comes after it, any more than Sydney
cathedral was caused by the crusades—if it
were, then it would be equally true that
prayer was caused by rain if the position of
events was reversed. No single individual
in all this earth can show by any reliable
evidence that prayer ever brought rain down
before its time, or that it ever altered the
natural course of events in any other respect
by so much as one hair’s-breadth. It rains
alike on the just and the unjust—on the just
man who prays and the unjust one who
scoffs ; therefore, if all men were just, or all
were unjust, the end of the drought-season
would arrive just the same.
# # •
With the diffusion of knowledge it has
come to be more and more recognised that
this little, unobtrusive globe, as well as the
rest of the universe, is governed by fixed
laws, and that no supernatural power goes
out of its way to suspend these laws under
any circumstances whatsoever. Therefore,
man drains the Koo-wee-rup swamp by busi-
ness-like toil, on the understanding that no
appeal to any Divinity will remove moisture
from low-lying regions that have no natural
outlet, and that unless he learns how to do
it himself things must remain as they are.
In earlier days, before engineering became
an art, he would probably have prayed for
its removal, if the said removal would have
involved any great personal benefit, and
been much disappointed at the result ; and
to-day, if he knew that his ancestors had
endeavored to remove moisture by prayer,
he would comment strongly on their ignor-
ance, and rightly assume that their appeal
was not answered. And some centuries
hence, when man has learned—as he pos-
sibly will sooner or later—how to control
the rainfall by scientific means, he will look
back with the same scorn upon the ignor-
amus of to-day who supplicates his Divinity
for the removal of droughts, instead of re-
moving them by hand according to a per-
fectly simple process, and he will also rightly
assume that the appeal brought no response.
The man of the nineteenth century who calls
upon Heaven to remove the present dry
spell before its time has no right to ridicule
the much more devout person of the tenth
century, who asked the same Divinity to
remove comets before their time. And
when he recognises the fact that the tailed
portent preserved its ordinary course, and
departed not one second the sooner for all
these supplications, he gives away his whole
creed in one sentence.
• * *
The little that is known of the mystery
of the Cosmos goes to show that every-
thing has a cause, and is itself the cause
of other things' 1 which come after it, and
that every cause works out its result to
the end. Therefore, the ages are an un-
broken chain of events, not one link of
which can be displaced without upsetting
the past and the future, as well as the pre-
sent. The causes of the present drought
began when the first wind blew upon the
surface of chaos. The whole series of events
has been leading up to it for billions of ages,
since before the time of the cave-man, and
the glacial period, and the days before the
glacial period was in its infancy. It could
not have existed but for the atmospheric
disturbance which some ape-like ancestor
made in Asia Minor when he fanned his
decaying fire with a leaf to accelerate the
cooking of the hindquarter of the wild ass.
It is partly owing to the hiccups of the first
recorded “drunk” under the shadow of
Ararat, and partly to the fiery breeze which
rose from burning Sodom, and partly to the
temporary cooling of a few pints of air
beneath the shade of Jonah’s gourd. And,
for the rest, it is caused by everything that
was done or left undone since the beginning
of all things, to the rustle of every leaf on
every tree in five continents, to all things
that are or ever have been ; and it, in turn,
is an essential feature in deciding the destiny
of everything that is now or that is to be as
long as this globe lasts and, it may be,
even longer. And the people who ask their
Deity to interfere with the course of nature
ask Him, not only to reverse the whole course
of the future, but to undo the past from its
commencement to now.
* * #
Some day, probably, man will learn how
to control the rainfall, and thus avert the
disasters of drought and flood. If so, he
will learn it as part of an orderly sequence of
events which began when the first man, or
semblance of a man, first learned anything.
Then, instead of one drought being cut short
by a violent interference with the usual
order of things, all such calamities will cease
through the operation of a cause which was
in preparation before protoplasm—if there
ever was such a thing—began to exist. Mean-
while, experience teaches this thing above all
others : The world is a slaughter-house,
where no Power interferes to save anyone
from the consequences of his own ignorance,
no matter whether he is personally responsible
for his ignorance or not. If he lives by a
malarious swamp, because he knows nothing
of sanitation, he dies of ague, or yellow-
fever, or some other complaint suited to his
surroundings. If he has granular disease
of the kidneys it kills him, because he has
not yet learned how to cure that ailment.
If he acquires true leprosy the result will be
fatal, humiliationand prayer notwithstanding,
unless someone discovers the remedy which
has hitherto been sought in vain. The
question whether the discovery of the
remedy will be a divine answer to prayer or
a mere earthly circumstance is one which is
not worth discussing. And, similarly, the
drought-curse will only cease in this dry
land when some remedy is provided by
human agency, and that remedy will be the
inevitable consequence of an unbroken chain
of circumstance whose beginning was before
the commencement of antiquity. What
supernatural power was the cause of that
beginning is a question which this paper
leaves theology to determine in any way
that suits it best. At the same time
its faith in the modern parson as a
means of throwing light on that stupen-
dous mystery is strictly limited. The
mystery is so vast, and the expounder
thereof is so small, and so mentally abbre-
viated, and so chained to the literal inter-
pretation of an impossible Genesis, that the
two are hopelessly incongruous.
A Social Cancer.
The knife of the abortionist may have slain
Jessie Nicholls, but Society placed the knife
in the abortionist’s hand. So long as social
traditions make motherhood out of wedlock a
social shame, so long will the trade in abortion
flourish, and so long will ignorant girls risk
death rather than “ disgrace.”
* * m
“Disgrace!” The “disgrace” of being a
mother, of performing the sacredest and most
necessary function of humanity ! The “ dis-
grace ” of the supreme self-sacrifice which lights
the Madonna’s face with its ineffable glow—
that mystery of beauty which a thousand men
of genius have vainly sought to place on canvas,
while Nature mocks them from the eyes of the
humblest peasant-girl who bends over her babe !
The “disgrace,” being a woman, of flowering
into perfect womanhood, of going down into
the Valley of the Shadow of Death to bring up
the jewel of a new life, of making the race one’s
debtor, and placing in the hands of Existence
another torch to light the path through the
voids of Eternity ! Motherhood a “ disgrace ”
under any circumstances whatever ! What a
grotesque perversion of ideas !
* Hr *
Vet to this perversion, which conventional
religion has embedded in her sex, Jessie
Nicholls fell a victim. Continually before
her uprose the vision of the pointed finger, and
the sidelong glance, and the skirts hastily
gathered from the reach of “contamination,”
which besets every girl who has dared to give
way to natural impulses without waiting for
conventional religion to patter its formulas.
Jessie Nicholls’s blood was spilt on the altar
of the Moloch of Chastity, whose priest is the
abortionist, and whose worshippers are “ vir-
tuous women.”

Only the packing-case in a Woolloomooloo
lane is new : the rest is an old story. From
the number who trade in abortion, notwith-
standing the risks, judge the profits and the
number of clients. From the number of deaths
discovered, judge the number successfully
hidden. Effects so widespread must have a pro-
found cause. But Society deals always with
the effects, never with the cause. Society
drives a girl to the abortionist, who kills her
and her child, and then Society, if it is lucky
enough to catch him, and if the circumstances
are sensational enough, hangs the abortionist.
Three lives are blotted out, and Society goes to
sleep again—surrounded by other abortionists.

Abortion will never be ended until public
opinion is enlightened enough to understand
that the difference between chastity and un-
chastity, legitimacy and illegitimacy, is not a
difference of morality or religion, as those terms
are generally understood, but one purely of
individual and social convenience.

Abortion may be restricted by providing hos-
pitals where the only conditions of admission
are imminent motherhood and no questions
asked. No woman not a patient should be
allowed within five miles of any hospital. A
possible man under the bed should never hear
Lady Blank, the patroness, or Mrs. Dash, the
committee-woman, clinch routine queries with
the inevitable, “And now, my dear, who is
he '( ” The hospital should take charge of the
children, if desired, and should return them to
the mothers when desired. Only voluntary
contributions to the cost of the children’s main-
tenance should be received. So the State may
save many good mothers and rear many good
citizens.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Kanakaland Judgeship.
The jobbery in connection with the vacant Q.
Judgeship is an interesting example of the
gentle art of bleeding the country. In the
first place, the deceased Justice Harding’s
place need not have been filled at all. Five
Supreme Court Judges sitting in Brisbane are a
wasteful and ridiculous excess for a 400,000
population distributed over 668,000 sq. miles
of territory. Three Judges could easily do all
the work brought before the court at present,
or likely to be brought before it for a long time
to come. The fourth should undoubtedly be
sent on circuit in the Central district. In the
second place, if the vacancy w T ere filled, it
should be filled by the promotion of one of the
three District Court Judges, Paul, Noel, and
Miller —all well-qualified men who deserve
a step up. But the shocking Q. Govt,
couldn’t let slip such a fine chance of
patronage. Attorney-General Byrnes, of
course, had the first offer of the vacancy, but
that acute personage probably aims to follow in
the footsteps of his master Griffith, and lift
himself through the Premiership into a £3500-
a-year Chief Justiceship. It is far too early for
him to write “ Closed ” on the door of his poli-
tical career. So the claims of broken-down
politician Garrick, one of Griffith’s tame
poodles in the palmy old Liberal days, were
warmly espoused by the Griffith-Byrnes
alliance. Griffith made Garrick Agent-
General 10 years ago, and he has hung on to
the office like a leech ever since. MTlwraith
dislodged him in ’BB, but Griffith apparently
made his reinstatement a condition of the
’9O Coalition, and the bebaubled James
has “ been there ” till date. Several
times there has been talk of recall, and
two years ago M'llwraith actually sent
Wm. Forrest to England to succeed him, but
Garrick managed to hold on. He is over 60,
his health is not good, and he makes an exceed-
ingly bad Agent-General. He would make a
much worse Judge, seeing that he has not
practised at law for about a dozen years, that
he wasn’t much of a lawyer when he did prac-
tise, and that his long absence from the profes-
sion and the province has put him out of touch
with both. Apart from that, Queensland
wants on its Supreme Court Bench young and
vigorous men, not elderly valetudinarians.
The struggle in Garrick’s mind must be in-
teresting. He badly wants the judicial pension,
but lie doesn’t want to leave London, and he
doesn’t want to expose himself as a Judge. At
time of writing, he hasn’t decided whether to
come or not, but the awful Q. Government is
urging him all it knows how, for the Agent-
Generalship is wanted for invalid MTlwraith,
and when the two nominees drop out shortly,
as they are bound to do in the natural course of
things, there will be more patronage which can
be liened as may seem desirable. The electors
are expected to sit down under this sort of
thing quite patiently. The Q. elector rather
prefers to be kicked before he licks the boots of
the gang in office.
A Representative Citizen.
In modern Melbourne the term “ representa-
tive citizen ” has lost all respect. It has de-
generated into a scornful epithet applied by
irate cab-drivers to over-zealous policemen, and
hurled at merchants by hands who find their
services hastily dispensed with. Conferred
upon a bishop it is flat blasphemy. And this
peculiar state of affairs is easily understood.
Mayor Bingy Benjamin and Speaker Matthew
Davies were contemporaneously the two
gaudiest citizens that Smellbourne ever boasted.
Speaker Bent, if less gaudy, was distinctly
more aggressive, and the city hasn’t forgotten
the spectacle of a representative Bent and
Benjamin paying homage to ex-representative
Davies on his return from a trip to London via
America. Premier Munro was still the most
exalted citizen of them all when 4000 of his
fellow-creatures crushed into the Town Hall to
proclaim him unfit for the Agent-Generalship,
and another 4000 swelled the roar of derision
from outside the building. These are matters
of history, showing how the possession of a
dignified place in Victoria’s capital justifies a
strong suspicion that the holder ought not to
be there. Likewise they are presumptive
evidence that any Victorian whom the
Queen delights to honor deserves no particular
honor in his own country—a reflection which

many knights of the Michael and George
order can put in their pipes and smoke at
leisure. Lawyer Snowden, Mayor of Mel-
bourne, is one of the latest recruits to the
Davies and Benjamin rank. The Queen
honored him on her last birthday. He was a
“ representative ” citizen; the old lady s advisers
had not profited by experience ; so she made
worshipful Snowden a K.O.M.G. Therefore,
in the natural course of events, when this newly-
dignified person attempted to preside over a
great public meeting, convened for the purpose
of considering a question that touches Mel-
bourne’s heart, brain and stomach, the multi-
tude present arose and practically spat Snow-
den off his representative platform. True, the
promoters of this popular gathering had in-
vited the Mayor to take the chair. F rom a
Tory point of view they assumed that his office
made him a fit and proper person to preside
over them, but they reckoned without the host
of unorthodox humanity seated elsewhere than
upon the platform. To these it seemed that
a meeting of protestants against Sweating
was morally bound to repudiate any
official connection with a lawyer-mayor, who,
by his acts and utterances, had proved himself
the Sweaters’ patron. It was nothing to them
that Snowden is now in his third year of civic
glory, aK.C.M.G., and a Leg. Councillor elected
without opposition. They judged him on his
merits in relation to the labor question, not as
a representative figurehead at quarterly lun-
cheons, and on his merits they despised and
rejected their quaking chairman. A more
vigorous outbreak of indignation has not oc-
curred in Melbourne since the night when the
same hall resounded with jeers for James
Munro. It was a healthy explosion which
cannot fail to leave a good influence behind it.
The representative Snowden stands revealed in
his true public light. This triplicate Mayor
and baubled citizen, this new ornament of the
Legislative Council, is so notoriously out of
sympathy with popular feeling that the people
refuse to tolerate his presence, even under the
auspices of their favorite spokesman, if a popu-
lar grievance comes up for discussion in the
L'own Hall.
The Yellow Man in the Golden West.
One clause in the Westralia Goldfields Bill,
providing for issue of miners’ rights and busi-
ness licenses, puts a wholesome embargo on
Asiatic and African aliens. Colored claimants
to the glorious, etc., rights of British citizen-
ship can only be licensed to mine or trade “ by
authority of the Minister.” Premier Forrest
“ thought the clause would prevent all such
from obtaining rights at all.” Moran (member
for Yilgarn) wanted the embargo to be made
stringent and absolute so as to bind future as
well as present Ministers, and then R. F. Suoll
rose on his hind legs breathing a hot gale of
jingo wind :
Clause 12 I also object to, with the hon. member for
Yilgarn, and that is as to the proviso, which says:—“ No
miner’s right, consolidated miner's right, or business
license shall he issued to any Asiatic or African claiming
1,0 be a British subject, without the authority of the
Minister first had and obtained.” I presume this relates
lo Asiatics or Africans who are British subjects, and I
consider this is an interference with the rights of British
subjects. It is the inherent right of all British subjects
to be placed on equality, in whatever part of Her
Majesty’s dominions they may he. The hon. member for
Yilgarn says he draws the line at color ; hut when wecon-
sider that India, which is one of the most important
parts of Her Majesty’s dominions, is occupied by a
race of a different color from ours, it is hardly for this
small colony to say we will not admit British subjects
from India on the same terms as ourselves. I think this
proviso will jeopardise the passing of this Bill, because
Her Majesty s representative in this colony, when he
finds there is an interference with the liberty and rights
of British subjects, will not be doing his duty to his
Sovereign unless he reserves the Bill by sending it Home
for Her Majesty’s assent. When this Bill gets into com-
mittee, I shall move to strike out the proviso ; and, if not
successful, I shall afterwards make it my business to draw
the attention of Her Majesty’s representative in the
colony to this matter.
Haw ! The lonely idea wandering about in
Sholl’s head - cavity that the abject Hindoo
from India’s cholera strand can willy - nilly
claim citizenship anywhere in Australia, is so
inherently vicious as to suggest the possibility
of its being correct in law. Anyhow, such law
is like silence—name it and you break it. Aus-
tralian Parliaments are used to having their
own foolish way, filling up the gaps with God
save the Queen and refreshments —but imme-
diately the Queen tried to save herself or her
Asiatic abjections at Australia’s expense, the
true inwardness of the British connection
would dawn on our legislators. The Rulletin
hereby offers its assistance to Sholl to stir up
Acting-Governor Onslow, and all the official
foolishness Onslow stands for, to enforce Aus-
tralia’s political obligations to certain festering
millions of Asia. The sooner Australia gets
the opportunity of sitting down hard on some
inherent rights of “Her Majesty’s” yellow
men the better.
The Parsbn and Private Judgment.
Judge Williams addressed a few remarks to
the Melbourne Methodists on a recent Sunday,
the burden of which was that dogmas w ere of
little importance compared to kindness, honesty
and other virtues, and that it was possible to
be a good man and yet be “ wholly unortho-
dox.” The natural result was that the Churches
boiled over with a beautiful unanimity all the
next week. This was only to be expected ; a
theory which implies that true piety doesn’t
necessarily involve going to church and con-
tributing to the salary of the man who grinds
out the tale of woe in the pulpit, always makes
the Church boil over furiously. The parson
who boiled hardest was the well-known Dr.
Rentoul, who began his reply by remarking
that “no one would take too seriously Judge
Williams’s advent into the higher regions
of theology ; whatever his opinions were they
c«uld be of no importance.” Of course, Mr.
Williams, being a layman, bis opinions are of
no importance in the eye of an infuriated cleric.
The Protestant churches all professedly travel
on the doctrine of freedom of conscience and
the right of private judgment—provided the
owner of the conscience adheres absolutely to
one or other of their various forms of ortho-
doxy. But if he doesn’t, then Rentoul
asks with a snort what any layman wants with
a conscience or a private judgment of his own
if he won’t use them the way he is told; and
rises to point out that no one but parsons and
people who think as parsons direct them
knows anything about religion, and when
a person who doesn’t believe as the parsons
direct starts to believe at all he is a
theological impostor. The fact that the Pro-
testant parsons have some 200 different systems
of theology, about which they contradict each
other constantly, doesn’t in the least diminish
this high-toned contempt for the layman who
has a 201st system of his own ; the fact that at
least 199 of their own creeds must be wrong in
no way tones down their lofty assurance that
his one creed can’t possibly be right. The
Rentoul attitude practically amounts to this :
Every man has the right to think as he pleases
provided he pleases to think in the way some
recognised variety of preacher tells him to, and
not otherwise. But if he starts thinking out-
side the well-worn grooves of preacherdom,
then the cleric rises to ask in tones of wither-
ing scorn what right a common lay person has
to think, or imagine he thinks, at all? Which
is just the question that the Holy Roman
Church used to ask in the Middle Ages.
The A.A. Monopoly.
About 70 years ago sundry English speculators,
calling themselves the Australian Agricultural
Co., applied to the lamented George IV. for a
grant of land in N.S. Wales, and that benevo-
lent monarch promptly handed over to them
a little more than a million acres at the nominal
price, so far as can be ascertained from some
confused old documents, of <£22,500. There
seems to be considerable doubt as to whether
this amount was ever paid in full; at all events,
if it was, none of the money ever came to New
South Wales. The co. also got 2000 acres of
valuable coal-lands, and a 20-years’ monopoly
of the coal-mining industry in the Hunter River
district. Since the beginning of its career it
has collected its rents and profits assiduously,
and worked its coal-mining property to the best
of its ability. Its grants remain almost intact.
It owns 464,640 acres of very valuable land
in the vicinity of Newcastle, including three
river frontages. It possesses 313,298 acres in
the neighbourhood of Tamwortb, and 249,600
acres in the vicinity of Gunnedah. Its territory
covers nearly half the county of Parry ; about
one-fifth of the county of Gloucester ; and
something like one-sixth of the county of Buck-
land. Over a great part of these areas it blocks
settlement assiduously, and as there is no
land-tax in New South Wales, and no
system of local government within its domains,
it contributes practically nothing to the revenue
and never has contributed anything worth
mentioning. Last year—a year of unexampled
depression in its history—it took out of the
country nearly £70,000, of which £55,000 was
clear profit to its British shareholders —a sum
which is about equal to all the English money
it actually brought into the country in all its
lengthy career. N.S. Wales has paid this great
incorporated landlord, as far as can be esti-
mated from the scanty sources of informa-
tion available, directly or indirectly, between
£1,000,000 and £2,000,000 for no other reason
save that it does the country the honor
to exist and draw its profits regularly. As
land grows more valuable through the increas-
ing demand it will go on paying the Agricul-
tural Go. for existing and hindering the national
progress at a steadily-increasing rate ; the fact
that the co.’s shares, nominally paid-up to
£2l 10s., are now selling in London at £66 10s.,
is a sufficient evidence of the excellence of its
present prospects. If New South Wales desires
to get rid of the incubus, this valuable British
institution will probably want anywhere
between one and two millions as payment for
leaving the country which it has burdened with
its presence for nearly 70 years. Altogether,
the famous A.A. Co. is about the most power-
ful argument in favor of a graduated
land-tax which could be imagined. Under
the scheme now before Parliament this
gigantic foreign monopoly will be taxed
at exactly the same rate as the owner of
a comparatively small estate who has paid to
the Treasury the full value of his holding. In
Maoriland the A. A. Co. would be struck by an
ordinary land-tax of Id. in the £ per anqumon
the capital value of its property, and, in addi-
tion, a graduated land-tax of 2d. in the £ for
the reason that its estate is above the value of
£210,000. This would mean that the State
would annex one-fourth of the profits, and the
probable result would be that the A.A. Co.
would sell out, at a considerable reduction, to
small holders, and the country would no longer
be under an obligation to find 12J or 15 per-
cent. dividends for the British shareholders.
Also, if it didn’t sell out and leave the country,
an absentee tax and a heavy Local Government
tax would further reduce the profits, and the
A.A. Co. would probably contribute £25,000 a
year or so to the revenue. In New South
Wales, even under the Reid land-tax, it won’t
contribute anything worth mentioning.
The Anglo-Jap Treaty.
A person of no special account named Brown
moved the adjournment of New South Wales
Council one day last week “ to call attention to
the neglect of the Government to take steps to
bring the colony within the operation of the
commercial treaty agreed to some time ago
between Great Britain and Japan.” And in
reply to Brown, Attorney-General Want ex-
plained that the Government had, as yet, come
to no decision on the subject, but it recognised
that the treaty “bristled with advantages,”
and “ when anything definite was done the
House would be at once informed.” Consider-
ing the circumstances of the case, it evidently
needs to be impressed upon the Government
that the House must be informed before any-
thing definite is done—a good while before.
The Anglo-Japanese treaty is about the most
ruinous agreement to which Australia could
possibly be a party. Its main provisions are
that there shall be Freetrade, or something
very closely resembling it, between Britain
and Japan, and that the subjects of either State
entering the territories of the other shall be
subject to no disabilities which do not apply to
all other foreigners. It is also provided
that Australia shall be included in the
treaty if it so desires. The arrangement is
eminently satisfactory so far as Britain
is concerned. That country admits the
goods of all the world free, with a very
few exceptions, therefore it only gives to Japan
what it would have given in any case, and gets
a substantial concession in return. Britain is a
great manufacturing country on cheap - labor
principles, and, under the treaty, will probably
sell large quantities of goods to Japan and do
pretty well out of the business. And whereas
the English capitalist will probably pervade
Japan in considerable numbers, and build rail-
ways and open up mines and run syndicates to
his own great advantage, the Jap isn’t likely to
come to England in any number, and even if
he did he would hardly be noticed among
40,000,000 inhabitants, and the fact that his
goods come there won’t make things much worse
than they are, seeing that England is already
flooded with the goods of all nations. But, if
New South Wales or any other Australasian
province becomes a party to the treaty, the
Japanese cheap laborer will come here in
myriads, this being the most conveniently
situated country on earth for a Jap inva-
sion, and he can’t be poll - taxed or
otherwise discouraged. Also, his cheap-
labor products will come in abundance and
swamp this country’s comparatively small and
feeble industries, which, under existing wage
conditions and working on eight-hour prin-
ciples, cannot possibly compete with the irrup-
tion ; and, except for a small and very dubious
trade in meat and wool —if the cotton-clad and
vegetarian Japanese wants meat and wool,
which is doubtful—there is nothing which Aus-
tralia can sell in return. The Anglo-Jap.
agreement is a good enough bargain for
England. For Australia it is so utterly one-
sided and ruinous that it comes as a hair-
raising surprise to learn that the Reid Govern-
ment has found anything to consider in the
matter. According to Mr. Want, “the
Government wants to eliminate the objection-
able clauses so as to obtain the advantages
without the evils.” It would be interesting to
know what are the advantages, and what view
the Ministry takes of the evils, and which
objectionable clauses it wants to eliminate out
of a measure which is objectionable all through.
The Bulletin has again and again called in a
loud voice on Tories and all anti-Socialists to
enact the minimum wage for protected indus-
tries. This provision is needed because Pro-
tection can only checkmate the monopolist
without, leaving the monopolist within un-
hampered. Fat Man swears that the minimum
wage is a dangerous idea, and an impedi-
ment to the glorious doctrine of competition,
and The Bulletin’s suggestion is “economi-
cally ” so suicidal as to command the admiration
The Argus has ’verted to The Bulletin doc-
trine. Witness 10th September, 1893 :
Now the desire is (or should be) that the operatives in
all these trades should receive some benefit from the high
duties which protect their employers. Everyone will
admit the justice of that contention. Why not enforce
it? Parliament has the power ; it has the right to say to
the master in any particular trade, “You are defended
against outside rivals; you have license to bleed the
people generally; but you are required to give a fair
share of the plunder which comes to you to the men and
women who work (or you.” Mr. Trenwitii, Mr. Prbn-
dbrgast, Mr. Bromlbt, and other Corner members owe it
as a sacred duty to their constituents to do something
tangible for their benefit before the tariff passes out of
hand, by inducing the Assembly to apply the minimum-
wage principle to protected industries.
In view of the obvious manner in which the
S.M. Herald frowns down any attempt to have
the Mount Rennie iniquity discussed in N.S. W.
Parliament (as evidenced by its exclusion from
its general summary of all mention of the
matter whenever it crops up in the Assembly),
it is interesting to remember that the Herald,
up to the very morning of the massacre, strongly
fa voted the hangingof the Mount Rennie convicts.
Yet on 7th Jam, the day of blood, it asked for
a reprieve—though by the time its leader came
under the eyes of most of its readers at the
breakfast-table, the four condemned boys were
dangling in the air ! The circumstances of the
trial, theretofore persistently urged by The
Bulletin alone, are alluded to in the Herald
(post-mortem) leader of that morning in these
words:—
It is the very essence of our criminal jurisprudence that
every criminal should not only be allowed the benefit of
counsel in his defence, but that every reasonable facility
should be afforded him by the court as well as by the
Crown. It has rarely happened that any cause for com-
plaint in this respect has arisen of late years ; but the
present instance is a proof that even this merciful rule is
not without its exceptions. Whatever the facilities
afforded to prisoners on their trial may be, they can be
of little avail when the sittings of the Court are pro-
tracted from day to day to such an extreme as to exhaust
the physical and mental energies of counsel and jurymen
alike. The celebrated Ticiibornb trial in England was
only one of many instances in which courts presided over
by the most eminent of English Judges have patiently
sat from day to day, for weeks together, for the purpose
of administering justice in the merciful spirit of English
law. But no case has been heard of in modern times in
which English Judges have compelled Jurors and counsel
in criminal cases invoicing issues of life and death to sit
all through the night in 'spite of repeated protests and
requests for adjournment.
Sooner or later, this much-shirked subject will
have to be debated in Parliament. It will
yet be thoroughly debated in spite of the general
legal conspiracy to smother it up in the interests
of the Judge ; despite the shuffling of political
lawyers too cowardly to do justice to one of a
number of persons who are indirectly the cus-
todians of the crusts for which those political
lawyers hunt when at the Bar.
Tub N.S. VV. Government proposes to spend
,£200,000 or so on forest-thinning, and it is
already spending large sums for lifting sand
from one place and putting it down in another,
both of which works are just about as useful as
shovelling the sea. Query : How much cheaper
is this than Protection, even as the Freetrade
party represents it to be? The Reid Govern-
ment proposes to destroy the N.S.W. sugar-
industry, which employs over 8000 bread 1
winners, on the ground that it costs the people
,£109,000 a year in the shape of a Protective
duty, which amount, by the way, helps to eke
out the public income, and saves .£109,000 a
year in other taxation. And, allowing
the Government pays only 10s. a week per man
in wages, it will cost .£208,000 a year in wages
alone to keep these 8000 people employed at
forest-thinning ; ako the State will have to pay
for tools, railway transportation and super-
vision, and it will lose the £109,000 which the
Treasury now receives. Even if protected
industries are as costly as they are said to be,
how do they compare with Freetrade, coupled
with sand-shifting and forest-thinning? Also,
what kind of an asset is a thinned forest or a
sand-heap that has been removed to a new
location ? The Bulletin hereby recommends
G. H. Reid to set the unemployed to baling-
out the Beautiful Harbor with pannikins. It
would save the railway-fares and supervision
expenses, anyhow.
The re-trial of prisoner Johnson, at present
serving a three years’ sentence for perjury,
said to have been committed in connection with
the celebrated Butler (N.S.W.) divorce-case,
is interesting in more ways than one. John-
son was committed by Judge Windeyer, and
tried and sentenced by Chief Justice Darley.
The depositions of the enquiry just concluded,
together with the presiding Judge’s report,
have been sent through the Justice Dept, to
the Lieut.-Governor (who, for the time being,
is Darley, C.J., aforesaid) for his decision.
Hence, if he decides that Johnson is to be
released, he is giving himself a back-handed
knock in his judicial capacity ; and, if he con-
siders Johnson must finish his sentence, it is
open for anyone to make invidious remarks.
Two facts protrude here. Firstly, no Judge
should himself send for trial any man whom he
accuses of perjury. The fact of a man being
committed by a Judge goes about half-way
towards convicting him, whether he is guilty
or innocent, inasmuch as the trusting public
still retains a superstitious respect for the
opinions of all Judges. All perjury-proceed-
ings should be taken by the Attorney-General.
Secondly, as The Bulletin pointed out long
ago, and as is provided by the Hew South Wales
charter of justice, no Chief Justice should
occupy any other paid position. “No man is a
competent judge in his own cause.”

Sydney Royal re-opened on Saturday in a
state of mitigated magnificence. The new decora-
tions are a very moderate success, and the aggre-
gate effect is greeny-yallery and feebly esthetic.
The general effect of “My Sweetheart” is also
disappointing. As it was played by Minnie
Palmer, some eight years ago, it was a pretty
little nothing about a wholesome, loyal country
girl who loved a lazy, picturesque youth in broken
German, and at last married him, after the other
woman was satisfactorily bowled out, and made
him a much better wife than he deserved. The
charm of it, on that previous occasion, lay in Minnie
Palmer’s brilliance and quaint prettiness, and in
Roberts’s picturesqueness and broken German;
and the dances and songs and miscellaneous bric-
a-brac filled up the rest in a cheerful, frothy kind
of way. Unluckily, William Gourlay’s thin,
anxious face doesn’t look in the least like the
laughing, irresponsible Tony. He acts the part
well enough, though he is rather cold and mechani-
cal at times, and his broken English wants to be
iialf-soled, and is gone in the front wheel, and
seems to have fallen with the buttered side down
and broken its knees, so to speak; but his haggard
eye is an impossible circumstance all through.
Miss Amy Gourlay, too, though she is a decided
improvement on brother William, is a painful
reminder of the Minnie of long ago; her singing
voice isn’t quite equal to the occasion, and her
dancing is commonplace, and, though she does
some excellent comedy here and there, the sum-
total is disappointing. The one unqualified suc-
cess of the play is the clever and graceful Nellie
Mortyne in the part of the lady with a horrid
past. Also, Ralph Roberts and Charles Field do
some respectable work, and the stupendous figure
of Mario Majeroni stalks around like a bird of
Jrey on top of a high mountain, and Miss Maggie
'ord fills an ugly part with success and a pair of
spectacles.
• # •
Somebody has been re-writing “My
Sweetheart ” since Minnie Palmer first produced it
in Sydney, and that person’s improvements don’t
keep step with the original. Tony is amusing at
first, but towards the long, sad end of Act 111.
his brilliant dialogue with Tina degenerates into
such remarks as “You vas a snoozer ! ” “I vas
not a snoozer ! ” “ Nein ! ” “ Yah !” or some-
thing to that effect. Also, there is a long and
dreadful discussion about the way to spell
“potatoes,” and, to lend point to it, the fierce
lady with the spectacles spills a quantity of
potatoes in Acts I. and 111., and the drawing-
room in Act 11. reveals some of the vegetables
she dropped in Act I. still lying on the floor as an
evidence of good faith. Further, Tina’s first
lover, the young doctor, has been turned into a
grizzled old person who looks like a gamekeeper
in a decayed state, and various other things have
been done to “My Sweetheart ” which come
under the head of unprovoked assault and battery.

William Elton’s “Judge,” at the Criterion,
is even a better show than The Bulletin re-
ported it in last issue, and the comparative weak-
ness of the public support is unaccountable. Pos-
sibly the public objects to the Judge washing
his feet on the stage, though, considering the
things that Australian Judges wash on the bench
without arousing much hostile comment, this
seems unlikely. Or, it may be that the hurried
incursion of the Judge in his night-shirt when he
is looking for the wooden infant’s feeding-bottle
does not accord with its finer feelings; but as he
is obviously not wholly dependent on the night-
shirt this seems unreasonable. Anyhow, a good
part of the community stays away with great suc-
cess, and thereby loses one of the best shows that
ever brought the judicial office into well-deserved
contempt.

The two Sydney variety theatres continue
to live up to their srood reputations. Also, Prof.
Kennedy consistently lives up to the bad character
which The Bulletin gave him last week and the
one before, and which it will gladly give him next
week also, and on various other occasions, unless
he removes from the oity or mends the ghoulish-
ness of his ways. A show which consists mainly
of a fat man persuading a hypnotised thin man to
drink kerosene and chew onions is an unclean
aggravation and a sewer-gas.

The Comic Opera co. begins a brief season
at Sydney Lyceum this Saturday, the programme
for the first week being four nights of “MaMie
Rosette ” and two of “ Madame Angot.” In view
of recent developments in the moral atmosphere,
the management considers it advisable to show
once more the fatal results that ensue, when a
guileless maiden in a brief frock takes a cup of
milk to the palace late at night without a chaperon.
The awful results of milk will be demonstrated in
the co.’s best style, assisted by first-rate scenery
snd accessories.

To-morrow (Friday), “Joseph of Canaan”
will resist the charms of Potiphar’s lady for the
last time. At least, he will do so if the business
justifies the sacrifice, but if the house is very thin
ifc is just possible that Joseph will simply remark
that it isn’t worth while keeping up the semblance
of virtue any longer to please such a thin audience,
and will elope with Mrs. Potiphar on the spot.
This would necessitate a revision of the last two
acts, but if Potiphar put a detective on Joseph’s
track, the rest of the evening might be filled in
pleasantly enough. Mr. Rignold makes his very
last appearance at Her Majesty’s on Saturday
when “ OJancarty ” will be played for one night
only.

The Jerusalem, of the Sydney Cyclorama,
has come from austere Adelaide via malignant
Melbourne to sinful Sydney, and is an artistic and
magnificent attempt to idealise the ancient, one-
templed, many-hovelled city. It is a poet’s dream;
an artist’s triumph ; it is a Dead Sea painted as a
Lake of Killarney ; a hovel painted as a gorgeous
palace ; a Mount Rennie painted as a Mont Blanc
with sunrise glories. And it probably cost more
than the whole of ancient Jerusalem itself, includ-
ing the Temple, if there ever was one.

Mark Twain has been interviewed on his
arrival in Sydney, and has cordially approved of
the Harbor. Then, being asked about the duel
which Max O’Rell proposed to fight with him, he
seems to have got into a violent frame of mind and
been restrained with difficulty from bad language.
M. Twain is announced to lecture for the first
time at the Protestant Hall to-night (Thursday.)

The two portraits printed on page 10 repre-
sent Miss Amy Gourlay and brother William, now
appearing as Tina and Tony, in “My Sweetheart,”
at Sydney Royal. Miss Gourlay is the daughter
of the late Scotch comedian, William Gourlay,
and was born in the bleak land of haggis a few—
certainly not very many—years ago. She has
been on the stage for about seven years, and has
played many parts with the B. and B. co.,
Williamson, Garner and Musgrove, and lately
with Mr. Stokes’s co. through Maoriland and
N. Her last Sydney appearance, if
The Bulletin remembers right, was at
the Criterion. Brother William was born
in Sydney at a comparatively recent date, and
commenced his dramatic career at the age of
three, when he took a hand in his father’s Cale-
donia entertainment. He is a composer as well as
a comedian, and the pretty song, “ Thee I Adore,”
which he sings in “My Sweetheart,” is a little
thing of his own. The brother and sister have
recently finished a highly successful season in
Maoriland, during which they played at Govern-
ment House for one night only, and led Gov.
Glasgow to express himself “deeply gratified.”
And Gov. Glasgow is reputed to be a serious
person who is not often gratified.

Bland Holtand “The Prodigal Daughter’’
took a long farewell of Melb. Royal on Saturday
night, and that experienced purveyor of lurid
melodrama is now en route to Maoriland with his
chariots, horses, carefully selected company, and
about 30 tons of scenery, including the Living
Bridge. Bland Holt, as he stated in a last grand
final advt., “ bears a natural antipathy to fare-
well speeches,” so he was allowed to tear himself
silently away, after expressing his feelings in a
series of eloquent smiles. Melbourne will miss
him very much. His season started at a time
when the opposition was strong enough to crush a
feeble class of show, and all the money he
made during twenty • two weeks of solid
success was well earned. The public had
never been offered such a filling entertainment at
the price. For a week or two the Royal will
remain hermetically sealed. The boards whereon
the lowering villains in the long frock-coats used
to enjoy their nightly 2.J hours of evil-doing until
Bland Holt whistled for the police are now being
scrubbed and otherwise made ready for George
Rignold, On October sth at latest G.R, will set
up his Biblical spectacle of “Joseph,” when that
redeemed section of Melbourne society which
abhors burlesque will roll up to witness the temp-
tation of Jacob’s white-haired boy by Mrs.
Potiphar.

“ Paul Jones," or rather the ghost of that
bygone glory, was revived at the' Princess’s on
Saturday. “Dorothy” was billed for Tuesday
and Wednesday, and to-night (Thursday)
“ Mikado ” is to wind the opera season up. A
decidedly new cast interprets Gilbert’s gorgeous
libel on Japan. The faithful Israelites who have
been reserving their patronage for this special
occasion will get another chance to gloat over Miss
Juliet Wray, and Miss Young's Katisha is bound
to interest the multitude. Then, for one night
only, the Princess’s will be closed like the Royal,
the Bijou and the Alexandra. Poor old Smell-
bourne 1

The return of the Gaiety Girlers from
Sydney ought to stir the city to its vitals. They
appear at the Princess’s on Saturday, starting
with “Gentleman Joe.” Four months have
faded and gone since Spencer-st. station was
moistened with the tears of many johnnies, who
mourned the flying angels of the co. as lost for
ever. The thought that they have fluttered back
again to play another brief engagement seems
altogether heavenly, and the box-plan is being
ticked off with enthusiasm.

The Bulletin takes the present oppor-
tunity to mention that Mrs. Grundy would draw
the line at more than one double entente which
tainted the air of Melb. Opera House, last Satur-
day night. A cerulean joke is often tolerable if
there be a certain delicacy in its tint. But a bold
beastly suggestion only serves to make half-a-
dozen gallery boys laugh, and everybody else
squirm. The Cambridge has wisely dropped the
burlesque portion of its show, substituting an
ordinary second part and a “screamer.”

Mark Hambourg and the ladies of the
Star concert co. are to give another little lot of
farewells at Melbourne Town Hall —the first on
Saturday afternoon (21st). Their Sydney season,
which began calmly, ended in a furore. By the
way, high Sydney medical opinions are to the
effect that the brilliant Hambourg had better “ go
slow ” for a season.
At Poverty Point,
It is likely, if London refuses to rave over our Nellie
Stewart, that she will organise a company and tour
'Murka with “Ma Mie Rosette,” Musgrove having pur-
chased the American rights of that amorous opera.
Juliet Flegellaub Wray smiles at the fun made of her
lath-like figure, and remarks that Sarah Bernhardt was
once very skinny.
Dear Bulletin,— Touching certain “Poverty Point”
pars, on the decidedly thin subject of Miss Juliet Wray.
In the first place, Juliet is nut ttie prima-donna of W. and
M.’s co., or she wouldn’t have to stand aside whilst
another girl plays Mu Mie Rosette, Dorothy, and other
singing characters that fell to Nellie Stewart. As a
matter of fact, Wray is engaged at a good salary to play
“leading parts only at the management's discretion.
Nilouche, the tomboy, and Clairette, the fish-fag’s
daughter, are the most successful leading parts which
Miss Juliet has undertaken hitherto. One of your para,
declares her voice to be “as fresh as a linnet’s.” Well,
it isn’t as fresh as the man (or woman) who made that
statement. Another “ Poverty Pointer ” says “ she lias
high notions about studying under Marches! for grand
Opt ra." lam not in the secret of Miss Wray’s notions,
but I'm game to bet you £1 sterling that she has far too
much intelligence to justify any such allegation. Juliet
Wray in grand opera! When are we to be told that
Daisy Chard is going ’Gome to play Lady Macbeth?—
Yours, Weary.
Thus contralto Ada Crossley ; “I will not return to
Australia until I can do so without being dubbed a

The latest addition to the B. and B. ranks is Miss
Katherine Hardy, now playing small parts with the
00. in Adelaide. She goes to Maoriland with it in
October, and will take up the roles played by Grace
Noble. So far, Hilda Spong does not seem to have joined
this co.
T ie terrible bat at which the nags in the racing-scene of
“ The Prodigal Daughter,” at Melb. Royal, rushed down
the stage was a puzzle to those who only saw the play
from the front. The horses were really started outside
Ah Goon's furniture-shop, 50 yards above the stage-door,
and, after running down Little Bourke-st., would turn
into the theatre up a carefully-prepared slope into the
view of the audience. The back-cloth itself was sus-
pended by two poles right in the middle of Little Bourke-
street, and four or five hundred unpaid supers, Chows,
larrikins and police, could be plainly distinguished from
the circle every night.
Nine West-end London theatres were open on Aug. Ist.
Their programmes included five farcical comedies, three
burlesques, and one melodrama. Ne’er a 41 problem
play,” serious comedy, or classical drama among the lot.
Dear Bulletin,—The special beauty of a chorus lady’s
voice is one of those things which gets discovered by
herself, as a rule. The discovery seldom spreads to the
musical conductor or the manager, who merely hear of
these wonderful song-birds in newspaper pars., and listen
for them in vain at rehearsal. A needy girl would
hardly take a valuable voice into the ordinary comio-
opera chorus when she could turn it to much more profit,
with much less trouble, at one of the variety-shows.—
Yours, Bah.
Lord Wodehouse, who (says the cable) has been struck
off the roll of J’s.P. for making a belligerent ass of him-
self at an election meeting, is, presumably, the Lord
W. whose brougham used to wait for Nellie Farren at the
Gaiety stage-door in her younger days. Lordly admirers
of burlesque ladies seem to incline to pugilism. There
was Lonsdale, addicted to putting Violet Cameron’s hus-
band outside on the mat, and Queensberry, the devoted
follower of Marion Hood to Australia—bruisers both.
None but the brave deserve the fair Gaiety girl.
George Bernage, of the 44 New Boy ” co., was defendant

Brough is despondent about the British drama. He says
there has been no improvement; the theatres are flehting
a losing battle with the music ’alls, probably because the
masses follow the aristocracv in preferring legs to brains.
Brough is doubtful about Mrs. Patrick Campbell, whose
one great success was as the Second Mrs. Tanqueray. He
says Forbes Robertson is a great actor, but Irving still
leads, his acting as the veteran soldier in “A Story of
Waterloo " being grand.
Brough has brought out a bagful of new plays, includ-
ing “ The Passport,” by Stephenson, and a play by a new
author, Watson, critic of St. James’s Gazette, the latter
to lie first played in Sydney.
Mrs. Brough spent her spare time in England autograph-
hunting.

Dear Bulletin, —Pressing their claims for pulpit-mono-
poly, Sydney goodies maintain that the theatrical im-
personation of Joseph’s temptation, as bowdlerised at
Her Majesty’s theatre, is immoral. Time enough for
their objections when the theatres give a living picture
of the dramatic Mrs. Potlphar episode, taken straight
from the hook which goodies hand to their innocent

Penley’s new farcical comedy is based oh the idea of a

the latter’s proclivities are transferred also. Like the

it replaced by that of a cat was for ever catching mice in
the dark.
A London critic recalls to mind Irving’s first production
of “ The Corsican Brothers ” at the Lyceum, when Pinero,
entering early in the character of De Meynard, was
mistaken for Irving and given a mighty reception.
The strong resemblance, in figure, gait and upper part of
the head, betweeen the two actors, was accountable
for the same droll mistake on one or two other first nights
when Pinero had to appear in advance of the star. See-
ing that the author of “ Mrs. Tanqueray ” has remained a
firm friend of his old manager since he retired from the
Lyceum Co. and the “boards,” it’s a strange thing that
he has never appeared in one of his original parts for a
dramatic fund benefit. Perhaps he may lend himself as a
special attraction (and “ Pinero, for one night only,”
would be a draw) when Ellen Terry farewells at fancy
prices.

Dear Bulletin, — It would require a great actor to ade-
quately portray a man lashed to a mast awaiting death
from the explosion of the powder-barrel beneath. The
stock-actor in this thrills the uncritical where the great
actor would astoidsh the most fastidious. In such scenes
the supposed uncultured patron of the “ darrellolloway

with a fully-developed nervous system ekes out the defects
in the acting from his own imagination.—P.

A BEAUTIFUL COMPLEXION.
It has long been known to scientists that for
improving the appearance and beautifying the
face oatmeal is far and away superior to all other
foods, but it had one drawback—the tendency to
heat the blood. To overcome this defect the at-
tention of eminent scientists lias been devoted to
the removal of this imperfection ; and now, after
long years of careful and diligent research, art has
triumphed, and Uncle Toby’s Rolled Oats is the
result, for, by skilful manipulation in the manu-
facture, all the heating properties have been ex-
tracted, so that now a beautiful complexion of
peach and ivory may be had by anyone who make*
a continuous use of Unole Toby’* Rolled Oat*.

Hygiene teaches that nothing is so bene-
ficial to the human constitution as thorough
cleanliness, a theory verified by modern revela-
tions of the deadly microbes which infest the
flesh and blood—especially if we do not keep
ourselves in a clean condition, which ought to be
the first aim of every individual with any esteem
for himself. The use of Amykos has proved to be
very important to this end, by its great sanitary
power over the skin, mouth, teeth, &c. If you
value yourself, never be without this excellent pre-
paration,*

846 Macquarie-street North, Sydney,
September 17, 1895.
My Dear Moorabinda—
The mantle of amateur efficiency possessed by
the “ Magpies ” has fallen on to “The Idlers,”
who gave their first performance, under the new
title, at Sydney Royal Standard last Thursday,
There was a large audience of the strictly society
order —the acting vice-royalties (they’re a star
part themselves just now) seemed to fit the niche
of patronage very well. It was a surprising
audience. Generally—at Sydney Lyceum, for
example—when you see a theatre full of cold
shoulder and boiled starch you settle yourself
down to dream of Babel; but when Society takes
to the boards the residuum of the Hot Tongs
gives a most patient hearing: “dog doesn’t eat
dog.” you know. And herein is a good idea to
settle the first-night-cackle question. Let the
management put salt on the tail of a Potts Point
amateur or two and lure them into walking “ on ”
with a banner when the d.c. threatens to be more
than usually fashionable.
“Going It” was the “Idlers’” worry. It
proved to be a most discreetly abridged version of
“L’Enfant Prodigue,” which made a rattling
farce, and perhaps it was the fact of two adaptors
having a hand in it that made it a little incoherent
here and there. For example, Mr. Gossett
(smartly and distinctly played by Captain
Dangar, whose bourgeois make-up was admirable)
tells Mrs. Dimpleton (brightly sketched by Miss
Austin) that he thinks of her “morning, noon,
and night,” regardless of the fact that he has only
heard of the lady five minutes ago—or when Mrs.
Gossett invited people to dinner “to-morrow”
and they turn up ten minutes afterwards. The
farce was excellently cast. Miss Gilles played
the ingenue with convincing artlessness; Miss
Winnie Austin played the pert, wily handmaiden
to the life—indeed, the only faults on the feminine
side were that the makes-up were not quite bright
enough, and that the dodging of stage love-making
was inartistically pronounced. Miss Qilles’s dive
out of the way of an imminent encirclement in the
last act was desperate enough to win Mrs.
Grundy’s most special approval.
The German baron was convincingly sketched
by Mr. G. H. Clibborn—make-up and accent
being excellent; Mr. H. Pollock made the major
the smooth and airy rogue he ought to be; Mr.
W. L. Rolleston played the lover (always the
worst part in ’chaw performances when hugging is
strictly proltibited) as warmly as circumstances
permitted, though I have no manner of doubt he
could put a lot more realism into it, while Mr. J.
P. Jones as a male prude, Mr. A. G. Lamb as
Bob, Mr. F. B. Wilkinson as a one-line captain,
and Mr. R. Innes as an outspoken valet, were all
letter-perfect and full of the rattling spirit of the
thing. In short, the Idlers went at it as hard as
possible and in a manner quite opposed to their
new title.
Talking of Mrs. Grundy reminds me that pretty
little Ethel Haydon is keeping up her reputation
for strict propriety in London just as she did in her
native Melbourne, where she was never seen in
public, you may say, without her portly mamma
mounting guard like the familiar ben with onechick.
On dit that May (Lady Francis Clinton
Hope) is more or less jealous or “ apprehensive ”
of Ethel, and that sparring-matches frequently
occur—the laurels going to the Victorienne in the
last “ scrum.” It seems that May got herself and
Ethel invited to a supper-party given by two
rowdedowdy lordlings—her idea being to queen it
over the Australian novice; but Miss Ethel
ruined the scheme by demurely replying that she
couldn’t possibly go anywhere, thank you, without
mamma. Evidently the blonde Ethel doesn’t
mean to return to us with her golden hair a-hang-
ing down her back.
The A.J.C. Spring meeting may lay claim to
showing the prettiest Derby dressing seen at
Randwick for some lime. The new fashions are
undeniably flighty—just suitable to give point to
a grand-stand or improve a lawn—and the gather-
ing recalled bright-butterfiy similes in conse-
quence. The hats alone suggested a very uncom-
mon garden where all sorts of flowers (we’re to be
regular Queens of the May so far as flowers go)
were amiably blossoming all at once, utterly re-
gardless of aearans, and though their style and
general aggressiveness (I mean the hats) augurs
badly for the comfort of summer patrons of the
stalls who wish to see the stage now and then, the
new head-gear is moat picturesque in a forty-acre
paddock, at any rate. As usual the acting-guber-
natorial box didn’t show the flower of the track-
ing—it seems to be the proud aim of A.Y.R.’s to
be as dowdy as the genuine article almost invari-
ably is. The handsome Acting-Governoress turned
out in a black silk skirt with a bodice the color
of ripe passion-fruit skin, and two crimson roses
in her bonnet—she also wore her fadeless smile,
which is the only unconvincing spot in her
performance, as real Governors’ wives are
generally champion scowlers. The A.G. turned
up looking faintly sportsmanlike about his pale-
grey-cheeked legs, but nothing short of a horse-
shoe scarfpin ami a straw in his mouth would turn
■his make-believe Ex. into a turfy character.
Mrs. Edward Hutton occupied a corner of the
A.Y.R. box (which was well patronised), wearing
a cottin-ish costume of black and silver, with a
black hat trimmed with pale-pink roses; the
Darley debutante wore cream, with a black gauze
hat trimmed with gay-colored roses ; Miss Kitty
Darley was in pale saffron with figured curry-colored
ribbons ; Miss Decima Moore (who was delighted
with her win on Bob Ray) wore black with mag-
pie trimmings, and an extra big hat (N.B. —Why
do little women always go in so for big toppings ?).
Another visitor, in bright yellow turned up with
green, suggested eggs-and-spinach.
Apropos of the vice-regal box, the back row of
that desirable society resting-place has an entirely
different meaning to what it has in the shows. In
the former the front row is always held by the
older and less alluring ladies who wouldn’t get
further than half-a-yard from the back-cloth if
they ever found themselves in the ballet, while
whatever of youth and beauty surrounds Gov-
mentouse is all jammed up in a heap behind ’em.
Theatrical managers must ache to re-arrange the
spectacle. Lady Darley tied the blue ribbon
round Bob Ray’s hot neck after the Derby—at
least she half did it —but horses are no courtiers,
so secretary Clibborn had to finish the trick.
Every Governoress isn’t a Lady Hopetoun whose
face would radiate delight at the prospect of get-
ting away from “ society ” into the company of a
thorough-bred horse, if only for five minutes.
The prettiest race-dress—a real race-dress only
fit for lawn work—was worn by a round-faced
Sydney society girl with a good figure. It was a
powder-pink silk, exquisitely fitting, and ethereal-
ised with pink chiffon on the bodice and here and
there a cluster of pink artificial roses and leaves ;
a large white hat weighed down with pink roses,
and a white veil and gloves. It was the men’s
favorite gown, too—men always like perishable
goods (except when they have to pay for them) —
and the only thing that rather commonified it was
a damsel in a pink silk blouse who was of the
party. Spring dressing is frivolous to the finger-
tips, and the surprise of the races was
the quantity of green worn in what was
predicted to be a blue look-out sartorially.
A society matron wore a sulphur-green silk
skirt with a pale-green pompadour bodice
flowered in pink, wide white hat trimmed with
pink roses and lilies, A Melbourne society spins-
ter (accompanied by Melbourne’s best-wearing
club man and a chaperone) wore an alpaca coat
and skirt, with white satin collar brocaded in
pink, and a black hat with cornflowers hanging
in it. A Melbourne society girl wore grey with
white muslin Puritan collar, black hat with red
roses; the Yic. Commandant’s wife looked
leopardish in blue with white spots. Miss Clarke
was the swell of the Geebung contingent, in blue
and pink striped brocade on a white ground with
pink and blue feathers in a white tulle hat —for
little Mrs. Rupert Carington was completely
out of it in grey, with pink flowers in a very
expressionless toque.
Australia’s popular sporting widow wore black
and heliotrope to signalise her deliberate progress
out of mourning. The point about Mrs. Eddy’s
toilet was her long cream gloves to the elbow, a
new fashion of wearing your paw-cases also pat-
ronised by Miss Nellie Hill, in a black-and-blue
frock. Mrs. Prendergast headed the subduedly-
elegant brigade in pale-green silk figured in black,
dodgy white satin bodice veiled in black chiffon
and trimmed with black jet and silver. Several
socially-prominent fat ladies wore things they
oughtn’t to have worn—for instance, grey and
black with flashing paste buttons, and obese black
lace parasols.
The Gees Gees were not strongly in evidence at
Randwick. Kaye was there got up like a race-
course tout, and Bradfield sported a large red
flower in his coat; also Flo. Lloyd and Ethel
Sehvyn were heard throwing maledictions at their
bad luck—but none of them were effective 1 And
Sydney’s popular ex-Mayor Manning turned up
at Randwick looking sunburnt after his trip ’Ome
and expressing himself delighted to be back again.
The Gaiety co. (which winds-up its sparkling
Sydney season to-night, Thursday) revived “A
Gaiety Girl ” —the most coherent spectacle of
them all —at Sydney Lyceum on Derby night, in
the presence of a full house, which didn’t seem to
have so much to talk about as usual. There were
two changes in the cast. Louis Bradfield played
the doctor in the manner suggestive of a person
who has some difficulty in forgetting what the
other man had done, and his Dr. Brierley was
another revelation as to how little the author has
to do witli the success of a principal droll. Brad-
field’s make-up was more medical-looking than
Monkhouae’s, but if the vulgar suggestion of
’Arry’s medico was pleasantly missing, the broad
humor of it was lacking also. Grace Palotta
played her pet part of Mina again with all her
former smartness and piquancy, her “philosopher”
song gaining the inevitable double recall. Miss
Palotta always feels more at home in short skirts
than long ones. Like a certain Judge, she believes
in there being much character in the feet.
Miss Moore played Rose Brierley in a brand-new
gown for the first act, and did wonders vocally,
considering the bronchial trouble she was battling
with. Her scene with Cecil Hope (in Bradfieid’s
part as Bobbie) went hilariously, owing to her
real life engagement with the youth being so well
known. The loud chuckling of the gallery over
the real • unreal spooning of these bona-fide
“engageds’’ made the scene on the bathing-
machine steps go very spicily indeed.
By the time these pearls of wisdom get
properly into type, the Gee - Gees will have
shaken the dust of Sydney off their
feet. It must be confessed that no insol-
vencies will strew their wake—there will be no
stone-broke Johnnies left behind like so many
dead marines after a picnic, pitiable testimony to
the 40h.p, fascinations of the tights brigade. The
truth is that Sydney youths have not lost their
heads, nor yet their hearts, over the Gee-Gees.
There has been a dearth of presents—it never got
much beyond the measuring of taper fingers for
diamond rings ; and there have been no expensive
surprises in the hearts of innocent bouquets. One of
the prettiest of Mr. Edwardes’ ladies will go back
with a glittering ring which she bought herself ;
another sports some new jewellery—'given to her
by the good old best boy she hawked along with
her. Other co’s went ’Ome with the news that no
Gaiety Girl could really say she had lived until
she had sounded the gamut of Australian extrava-
gance and star worship—nathless these latest
ladies struck a frost. Many reasons may explain
this. One may be that the local blades hadn’t the
heart to disturb such a complete family party.
The first Spring ball at Govmentouse was a
horrible spectacle for the still -on - the - hooks
brigade, who feel their stock growing more and
more flat when a bevy of damsels flood the market.
Half-a-dozen buds come out (officially speaking)
at the acting-vioe-regal dance, though their names
have flowed from the gushing pens of Society
scribesses many a time before. “ Coming out ”is
a weird ceremony in Australia,, where the nur-
sery takes a lot of finding, as a rule, and where
debutantes have taken the first edge off their
festive appetites with many small-and-earlies and
other unofficially recognised functions. Miss Sylvia
Darley, Miss Mort and her sister, Miss Harrison,
Miss Fairleigh Greene (lovely
and Miss Pearl Airey were the Society maidens
who went to the Society post on this occasion.
Good-looking some of them are, but judges don’t
consider them a very special lot of youngsters in
point of beauty. Somehow the best-looking people
get into Society by marriage. The picturesquely-
innocent effect of the debutantes was rather dis-
counted by there being so much white worn, as if
the idea was to swamp the coming-out show.
Pretty Decima Moore’s farewell “at home” at
her hotel on Monday was largely attended by sas-
siety, which took up Miss Moore during her
Sydney sojourn as violently as though she had
been Great Boulder shares. Miss Darley and Miss
Kitty Darley represented Govmentouse, and were
accompanied by Mrs. Rupert Carington, and the
only professional rays were Mr. and Mrs. Brad-
field. Mr. B. had a circle of society damsels
round him all the afternoon, and as he came in
with a button-hole and went away without it, one
can only surmise whether the aforesaid damsels
tore it from him piecemeal, or whether he gave it
away more sentimentally. Miss Moore enter-
tained her guests most übiquitously, and wore
a silken gown of shot-slate blue and straw-
berry, out of the pocket of which she
would produce—for the admiration of all and
sundry—a little bead-purse which was thrown to
her from the gods, attached to a floral spray. The
gods have thrown Decima many little tokens,
which she regards as her most complimentary
trophies. And certainly there is more compliment
in a rosebud from Olympus than in a bouquet from
lower down, for Olympus is disinterested—lT is
never asked to take afternoon tea with its divinity.
Mr. Cecil Hope, adorned with an Alec. Marsh
boutonniere, took it upon himself to see thatnobody
went away oppressed with sorrow which might
have been alleviated by tea, and so the afternoon
went smoothly on a quiet and highly-fashionable
plan.
Miss Ethel Stephens set the artistic private
views season a-rolling last Tuesday at her well-
lighted studio, 99 Pitt-street, which was combed
up for the occasion, with tea in the middle
distance. Miss Stephens has a dozen pictures,
including figures, flowers, landscapes, to exhibit
at the Society of Artists’ coming show. A study
of a well-known Sydney society girl, in pale
green, is a speaking facial likeness, but the mas-
siveness of the port has been rather kindly pared
down by the artist. It strikes me that two of
Miss Stephens’ best studies are among those not
destined to.be sent in. Beside her own pictures,
Miss Stephens exhibits the cream of her pupils’
work. The star of the students is certainly Miss
Hilda Humphery, aetat 13£, whose efforts show
much sympathetic talent.
About the most aesthetic report of an execution
that has ever appeared in print, so far as I know,
was the description of the hanging of Mrs. Dean,
the Maoriland wholesale baby-farmer and mur-
deress. It is full of picturesque points, and pecu-
liarly interesting in this day of woman-analysis.
Mrs. Dean had a “ dignified carriage and bear-
ing ” on the scaffold, walking with “ head erect
and thin, fine, iron-grey hair nicely brushed,
neatly parted in the middle, and fastened in a
knot behind.” (A woman, it would seem, does
her hair as carefully when she is going to be
hanged as she folds up her clothes before she com-
mits suicide !) As she ascended the steps of the
scaffold she managed (although her arms were
tied) “ to drop one hand sufficiently to lift up the
front of her skirt free from her feet and ascended
the steps more gracefully than I have seen many a
woman ascend the steps of a modern first-class
hotel.” Then she “ withered the hangman with a
look,” gracefully said “Thank you” to the Sheriff
—women are always polite to people in high
authority—and plumped into eternity. In her
cell afterwards was found “ a lock of her hair that
she had left for her husband,” and a bouquet of
violets and snowdrops—which are now, I presume,
somewhat out of fastiion in Maoriland for the rest
of the season. The Dean hanging, by the way,
had an interest for society, since the heroine was
the daughter of “an independent gentleman.”
Before going to her death, Mrs. Dean filled up
her own burial-certificate, as she “knew her hus-
band ” (who was tried and acquitted) " was not
familiar with all the necessary details 1”
Writes my Melb. correspondent
“A gilt-edged wedding took place the other
day, at St. George’s, Malvern, between Miss
Linda Langwell, of Toorak, and Mr. Wood, of
Newcastle, N.S. W. (a cousin of Mr. Essie Jenyns-
Wood). Miss Langwell is one of Melbourne’s
most admired belles; and Miss Wood, sister of
the bridegroom, who was first bridesmaid, is a
perfect model of what brunette-beauty ought to
be. The bridegroom looks rather as if he had
modelled himself on Brownlow, in “Nitouche.”
By way of thrilling novelty in bridal attire, Miss
Langwell wore white satin and Brussells lace, and,
to further cany out this innovation, the bride’s-
maids were attired in white silk, with orange
fixings. The newly-wedded are to reside in New-
castle.
“The lines of demarcation which aforetime
indicated different * sets ’ in Melbourne society
are gradually, by pressure of bad times, fading
out. These ‘ sets ’ used to cause much wonder
in the minds of visitors to Melb., who could never
make out where the ‘ best set ’ left off and the
‘ second set ’ began.
“ A little lady, who for years has been elbowing
her way into the ‘smartest’ set, gave a gorgeous
entertainment, to which she invited folk to whom
she dared not aspire only a year ago. It was
merely drawing a bow at a venture, so to speak,
and no one was more surprised than the hostess
when all the ‘ push ’ turned up. You see, there
is so little on now that one must put in one’s even-
ings somewhere. On this principle ‘ society 1
flocks to suburban mayoral balls, which were con-
sidered quite low only a few years ago. At the
Prahran mayoral dance, on Friday night, the
‘ best ’ people were much in evidence, and the
gowning was as superb as at any of the vice-regal
gatherings. It was an entertainment worthy of
‘the City of Dreadful Knights,’ for there were
five knights present with their appurtenances.
Yours affectionately,
SAPIHO SMITH.
Away in the far west of N.S.W, this is so
far the driest season for six years. And it has
been bitterly cold, too. Hundreds of square miles
of country west of Bourke are as bare as a Sydney
street.
Ain’t it sickenin’ ? S.M. Herald, 16/9/95 :
In connection with the bush fires there was last night a
vivid reflection north-west of Sydney. A correspondent
writes to say that the scrub about Clbntarf was burning
fiercely yesterday, and it was feared that the tree near
which the Duke of Edinburgh was standing on the
memorable day of the notorious Farrell shooting escapade
will be destroyed.
“ Whene’er two lions roar along the shore,
the second lion votes the first a bore.” Bret Hairte
and Mark Twain are the two most prominent
American humorists, and this is what Mark says
of Bret to a Sydney interviewer : “Bret Harte I
consider sham and shoddy, and he has no pathos
of the real true kind.” Now wanted, Harte’s un j
biassed opinion of Twain.
Q. Govt, was so eager to force Agent-
General Garrick’s hand that it gazetted him to
the vacant judgeship before it got his consent.
Since the par. elsewhere was written Garrick has
cabled that ill-health prevents him from accepting.
This disgusting obstinacy throws the Boodle-
wraith plans out of gear, and may force the
Govt, to act straight in spite of itself.
John Roper, the last survivor of Leich-
hardt’s first expedition, died at Merriwa, N.S.W.,
Aug. 16, aged 73. He accompanied the lost ex*
plorer and J. S. Calvert on the famous journey
from Brisbane to Port Essington in ’44, and the
Q. river Roper is named after him. In later life
Mr. Roper was a stock-inspector in N.S.W. public
service.
Possum Dean, the man whom Judge Win-
deyer saw, with the eye of faith, poisoning his
wife on several different occasions, has been sued
for maintenance and ordered to pay 12s. 6d. a
week. Mrs. D. demanded J5l, and her husband
offered 10s., hence the proceedings. He might
have escaped by offering the lady a home (“and
bring your ma along, dear ”), but he didn’t. Even
a more reckless bicyclist than Dean might have
acted similarly under the circumstances.
The noisy meeting at Melb. : Town Hall
was perfectly justified in howling Mayor Snowden
down every time he attempted to occupy the
chair in opposition to its desire. The conveners
of no meeting possess the right to nominate a
chairman ; the choice of that functionary rests
solely with the meeting itself, and the action of
Snowden in trying to force himself upon the
meeting and afterwards turning out the lights
when he failed in that object is only an im-
pudent piece of bluff. The triplet chanted in
the hall that night has evidently come to stay, and
will certainly be heard when Snowden’s time to
face the electors comes round :
Mayor Snowden’s pay:
Man, horse and dray,
Four’n’leven a dayl
The real truth of that “ unexpected ad*
journment” of the Vic, Assembly is not honestly
admitted by either side. The “tariff-reformers ”
saw a chance to rush a vote through in the absence
of several “high-duty” men. Graham Berry,
the old and ardent Protectionist, seeing a legiti-
mate chance to end the sitting, got out of the
chair and defeated the “reformers’ ” tricky tactics.
It might almost be argued that he fled almost in-
voluntarily. Anyway, the Speaker’s hasty depar-
ture couldn’t prevent a fair vote from beyig taken
when the House reassembled. Therefore, why
this howling and gnashing of teeth ? No vote is
better than a false vote, except for the side that
intended to snatch an inglorious victory.
The limp brothers Abrahams, who failed
to move an unsympathetic Law into letting them
off their sentences for the gun-fraud conspiracy,
have suddenly regained their appetites, and are
beginning to bloom again, all the profit to be got
out of fainting in court having been secured.
Louis, one of the precious trio, is said to have con-
fessed to malingering—which is rough on the
array of medical authorities who decided that his
was a genuine and pitiable case of physical weak-
ness. And when medical authorities meet with
a real case of suffering, they frequently turn it
away as bogus—as a man was turned away from
the expensive Sydney Hospital, the other day, to
die a few hours afterwards.
The three Melb. policemen who swore so
profusely in the Synnot divorce-case, to the effect
that the respondent was living in a local house of
ill-fame at a time when she was really in Europe,
have been found guilty of giving “reckless evi-
dence.” Therefore, they have been fined illO
each, with the alternative of two months’ gaol,
and they are now appealing to the Governor not
to ratify the decision. This makes up a very re-
markable situation. An ordinaryoivilian, under the
like circumstances, would have been tried for per-
jury, and would either have been acquitted on
ground that his false swearing was based wholly
on a mistake, or would have got two or three
years’ “ hard.” The Court takes an unsatisfac-
tory middle course in the case of the policemen ;
everyone knew that they had been guilty of
“ reckless evidence,” but what people want to
know is the cause of that lamentable recklessness.
All perjury is reckless evidence ; so is a lot of
evidence which isn’t perjury. Moreover, a sen-
tence on a civilian doesn’t require to be ratified by
the Governor, and why the “cop” should practi-
cally get a second trial which the other man
doesn’t is a mystery.

The color question again. Captain Neiten-

boys on board the N.S.W. reformatory-ship
Sobraon. The Col.-Secretary would like to rap
Neitenstein’s knuckles for raising the question,
but fears to do so. Hence the Inspector-General
of Police has been asked to take charge of black
bays ordered by magistrates to the Sobraon.

The other day' it was decided to remove Santo,
a Kanaka leper residing at the Q. lazarette,
to new quarters on account of the improvement
in his health and general condition. Santo, how-

to a leper child, for whom he has conceived a
strong affection. His wish was granted.

From Cooktown. At the District Court
it was observed that only roosters’ heads would
suffice to swear in the local Chow. On enquiry
being made as to the why and wherefore of this a
Northern Chinaman thus explained matters :
“ Well—spose Chinaman go ’longa lock-up—lock-
up man say: ‘You swear cut cock’s head off—

At a recent Full-
Court sitting, a barri-
ster’s account of the
lo wer-cou rt proceed i ngs
was questioned by one
of the Judges. Then
ensued a typical display
of legal tomfoolery. The
maligned innocent, “in
a voice quivering with
' emotion, ’’disclaimed all
intention to wilfully
deceive, but declared
that, under the circum-
stances, he must with-
draw from the ease.
Finally, he orated :yi
impassioned farewell to
profession, reputation,
and all that made life
worth living, and fell
back into his seat with
bowed head and folded
arms. The offending
dignitary, anxious to
get on with the case,
deprecated this extreme
view of the situation ;
but his victim sat as if
turned to stone. The
second Judge took up
the conciliatory strain,
and the third followed
suit with no belter suc-
cess. At last the Bench
lost patience, and pulled
itself together with a
concerted snort so pro-
longed and ominous
that, the shark sprang
to his feet, forgave his
enemies, and resumed
his speech.

About every thir-

The cocksure Tozer, in Q. Assembly :
“No case of leprosy from contagion has ever been
known.” Putting aside Father Damien’s reported
death from contracted leprosy in Molokai, it is
well known that medical men are divided on the
subject. If there is no fear of contagion, why
isolate lepers? With this comes news that yet
another white Brisbaneite has been found to have
had true leprosy for at least three years, and that
a man from Herberton (N.Q.), who was isolated
in the Moretou Bay lazarette for some time, but
released on the assumption that his symptoms
were not those of true leprosy, is now, after a
year, back again “for good.”

At Melb. abattoirs during last year 1900
cattle and 1300 sheep were condemned as unfit for
human consumption. At abattoirs not under
inspection, 2500 cattle and 2200 sheep with tuber-
culosis are estimated to have gone into consump-
tion.

A reputable N. S. W. citizen who visited cer-
tain abattoirs the other day relates his experiences.
“ Tliey have two ways of killing pigs there—one
(Yankee fashion), hitching them up by the hind
legs and cutting their throats; the other, knock-
ing them on the head with an axe and then bleed-
ing them. One pig which had been knocked on the
head resolutely refused to die, and, as the vat
in which he was to be scraped awaited a tenant,
the butcher threw a bucket or two of scalding
water over him, apparently as a punishment for
his obstinacy. Many pigs are rejected as
tuberculous, but I noticed that the healthy pig
is put into the vat which the tuberculous
pig has been washed in. What a mockery it
is—in one quarter all that magnificent hospital-
accommodation for the cure of disease, while in
another quarter the most hopeless and horrible of
diseases are being manufactured wholesale ! ”

worded that clause to read that a person, except
he possess certain credentials, shall not be at
liberty to take ‘‘any name, title, addition, or
description implying that he is a practitioner in
medicine.” When the Bdl came to the Assembly,
an amendment, moved by the Premier, worded
the clause thus—“ , . . implying that he is a
legally-qualified medical practitioner.” This was
carried, and, as a dissolution followed, the matter
temporarily dropped. But the difference between
the original clause and the clause as amended is
the difference between the Medical Bill of the

Mr. Justice Williams tries bard to live up
to his ideal, the late Vic. Chief Justice Higin-
botham, but falls short for want of material. His
recent Melb. lecture on the “New Religion ” was
a feeble effort after the outburst with which
Higinbotham shook up local orthodoxy. The man
who hopes to dethrone creeds, and starts out gin-
gerly with the assurance of his anxiety not “ to
say one single word which could jar upon the
feelings of anyone or offend in the slightest degree
the prejudices of anyone,” is battering stone walls
with a feather. Creeds and dogmas cannot be
attacked without lacerating the susceptibilities of
the devout, and the reformer who pretends to
CONSOLATION.

Rev. Rickard, of Brighton (Vic.) : “ One
fthe most insane of customs is that of asking a
man to ‘have a glass along with me.’ I can’t
stand a man who is always guzzling; who always
wants you to wet bargains. When a man asks
me to have a drink, I always reply ‘No, we will
have a bun.' ” This puts the great Cold Tea
failure in a nutshell. The yearning to have a
flabby bun, which lies like a wad of blotting-
paper on the “innards,” and the longing to make
other people have a bun, is the curse of teeto-
tal ism.
The Cold Tea apostle is somewhat in the posi-
tion of the aggressive atheist, to whom the Chris-
tian cries : “ Yon would take away my faith and
give me nothing in return.” Similarly, the wine-
hibber to the apostle of ginger-beer : “ You would
take away my whisky and give me what?” What,
indeed !

Gov. (pro. tern.) Madden lias never missed
an opportunity of making a speech in his vice-
gubernatorial capacity. At the Vic. diocesan
festival in Melb. Town Hall he appeared as a
champion of conventional Christianity, treading
slyly on the corns of his judicial brother, Williams,
as a creator of schisms. “ Let us come into the
same field, and stand shoul ler to shoulder as
soldiers of Christ, whatever the name of our
regiment.” This is the sort of thing with which
persons of Position are expected to dose the
cmnnon people, and coining Iroin a man like
Madden, with Ids waxed moustache, his painful
p.»se, and his P.ll, proclivities, it excites only the
wildest derision.

Following the example of Justice Williams,
Justice Hodges delivered a Pleasant Sunday
Afternoon address at a Melb. Wesleyan
chosing naturally for his subject his blste noir,
“ The Evils of Drink.” As a serious, or even in-
structive, lecturer, he ran a bad second to bis
gifted confrere, but without doubt he contributed
unintentionally several humorous suggestions. For
instance :
He counselled all present never to take liquor unless
they felt that they absolutely needed it, and, instead of
entertaining their friends by offering them drink, he
recommended them to discuss questions of constitutional
h.story and of social improvement with those whom they
met, so that each would be better instead of worse after
the meeting.
Imaginary picture. His Honor’s washerwoman
calls round on Monday to pay her rent, and,
after her bill has been receipted, is asked —“ And
now, Mrs. , what is your opinion of the
exercise of the Royal prerogative during the reign
of George HI. ? ”
Judge Hodges declares that every adult
male in the province, exclusive of professed
Rechabites, consumes .£l6 worth of liquor per
annum, Hmexplained that Victoria’s yearly grog-
bill tots up to-,£3,739,000. Striking out children,
women, and “professed Rechabites,” lie divides
the little account amongst the remaining adult
males, and apportions to each 52gals. beer, 23
bottles wine, and 18 bottles spirits annually.
Why the adult male who does not wear the blue
ribbon should have visited upon him the bibulous
sins of the women and the “ professed Rechabite ”
is not obvious to the “ornery man.” The average
woman is not a teetotaller, and a rather numerous

We’re all automata, every one,
We’re conscious of nothing until it is done ;
The hue of the rose, be it ever so red,
Is nought but the whirl of a wheel in the head.
We’re self-adjusting mechanical toys
That weep mechanical pearls,
We’re only strong mechanical boys
And sweet mechanical girls.
Chorus:
We’re only mechanical, semi-Satanioal,
Clanical girls and boys,
Governed despotical, slightly erotica],
Penny-in-slotieal toys.
Our life is merely the plasrnic way,
The tune that the barrel must always play.
But it makes you feel uncommonly small
To think you’re mechanical, after all.
We’re a mountain of cells from the hair to the toe,
And we mingle, divide and swell,
For we’re only mechanical, don’t you know,
A rank mechanical sell.
Chorus :
Yes, we’re only mechanical, built-to-a-planioal,
Semi-Satanical toys ;
Our being is nought but mechanical thought,
Mechanical pains and joys.

The Bulletin has often wondered how on
earth the poor artist managed to pay the numerous
and stylish canvassers engaged in selling low-
priced art-union tickets—ostensibly for his (the
artist’s) benefit. The secret came out in Sydney
Bankruptcy Court last week, when it transpired
that an uncertificated bankrupt had been em-
powered to conduct a raffle of pictures from
the brush of a well-known Sydney painter.
The art-union was arranged before the pictures
were painted, the artist was paid the absurdly
small sum of £U for 17 paintings, and for the
purposes of the raffle the works were valued at

The “age of consent” in California is 10
years. In most American States it is 14 ; but in
some 16. In the State of New York, however,
mainly by the exertions of Women’s Reform
Associations, it is 18, and next session an attempt
will be made to increase it to 21. As the vast
majority of women make their matches between
16 and 21, strong opposition from the female
section of the community may be expected ; but
as minors have no votes the chances are that the
extended age will become law. Which should
give Australian girls something to think of.

Visitors to some matrimonial bureaux
must feel nervous when conversing with their
prospective partners in the parlor. How
many flabby ears may not be glued to listening-
tubes alongside the speakers, and what number of
spy-holes might not exist around the auburn hair
of Angelina? And just as the eager lover was
whispering “Darling, we will go straight away to
the registry-office and do these fools out their
commission ! ’’ the chances are that sounds of
derisive laughter would peal forth as a snap-shot
camera fixed the blissful couple, while the boss
made out his account for “ engagement effected,’’
and the office detective laced up his bluchers to

microbe of matrimony and destroy it altogether,”

The proposal of the N.S.W. railway de-

and George streets, Sydney, opens up a blessed
prospect of peace and repose and holy calm
generally. The electric train, if constructed .on
anything like reasonable principles, is almost
silent, and if it is run on anything like business
principles it should wipe out most of the omni-
buses, which are anything but silent. Their
wheels bounce horribly over the wood blocks. The
horses’ hoofs clatter dismally as the raw-boned
team drags its load behind it. The drivers scream
at each other in exciting moments, and howl at the
public to incite them to come into the awful
vehicle. And many ’buses now have a boy hang-
ing on behind whose sole business apparently is to
yell in an unspeakable fashion, with a shriek like
that of a lost soul. When two or three of these
vehicles get together, and all the boys set them-
selves to out-yell the rest, the result is beyond

this world or any other, who can yell like the
raucous lout who hangs on at the back of a Syd-

Free education doesn’t make much differ-
ence in the great fact that mankind are mostly
fools. A week or two ago some Sydney humorist,
commonly believed to be a butcher in an eastern
suburb, alleged that Astronomer Russell had fore-
told a tidal wave 90ft. high, which was presently
to strike N.S.W. with an awful whack and do
great damage. The story spread in all directions
and about half the population believed' it, more.or
less, and hardly anybody seemed to notice that a
wave 90ft. high was rather above the average, or
to know chat disturbances of this kind were not
foretellable. For several days _ the Govt.
Astronomer was swamped by terrified persons
who wanted information about a safe place to fly
to and other particulars. Then when the date
went by and no disturbance came, the general
decision was that the Government star-gazer
wasn’t up to his work, and his name is solemnly
handed down to posterity as that of the man who
foretold a tidal wave about 900 ft. high which
didn’t come off.
A correspondent: “ Sydney Technical Col-
lege the other day sent to a station near Nyngan,
N.S.W., half-a-dozen of its students to roll the
wool and pick the pieces in the shearing-shed. Do
these youths get wages, or do they give their ser-
vices in return for ‘ experience ? ’ Is the Sydney
Technical College heavily subsidised by the State
to supply cheap labor to the squatters and do
rouseabouts out of a job? ”

On the notice-board at a Melb. church <
ST. LEGER CHURCH.
Subject of Discourse, next Sunday:—
“ What we may expect in Hell.”
Free Seats and No Collection.
There’s nothing mean about Hell.
It is proposed to make, by prison-labor, a
carriage-drive to The Springs, half-way to the
summit of Mt. Wellington (Tas.). The inmates
of Slowbart gaol are delighted with the scheme —
which they regard as a sort of brilliant camping-
out holiday planned for their especial benefit.
The Australia Hotel, Sydney, is a palace
which cost .£300,000, and whose sumptuousness
causes the average man to drop his jaw with
amazement. It is conspicuous upon a con-
spicuous site, and its highest towers look
down upon Government House, the Harbor
of Delectation, the sunlit-splendor of the
Pacific, the city of Sydney itself, and all the land-
scape beauties which ultimately lose themselves
in the Blue Mountains and Heaven’s azure hue.
By moonlight the watch-towers can see as much
of what is going on in the city as the moon
herself, and while the thrilling associations
of the seductive moonlight agitate the mortal
breast it is apt to state that The Australia
has 100 double-rooms capable of holding 100
honeymoon couples. Another glorious feature is
that the magnificent vestibule is adjacent to the
queen of bars, and, therefore, the M.P. who
waits for a man in the vestibule can be sure of
getting a tonic to fortify himself against the
sobering debates of the ’Ouse. Perhaps it is no
argument in the Australia’s favor that it is so
close to the theatres, the .Library, the Post Office,
and the banks. All the trams, too, are so close
that it seems the easiest thing in the world to step
from the Hotel Australia on to the tram itself —
up to date, however, people have preferred
coming down in the lift, whose splendor caused
one visitor to begin undressing in it after paying
for the best of the 320 rooms in the palace.
Thought reverts lovingly to the vestibule, not
because of its proximity to the bar, but because
it was here that the Divine Sarah Oleopatrioally
embraced a feminine friend, whom she had not
seen for years. Hot and cold water are in every
room, and the man who cannot quench his morn-
ing’s thirst with these has only to press the button
of the electric-bell in order to get a cwt. block of
ice, a hogshead of iced-water, a teaspoonful of
whisky, and a 100 o.p. iced-soda. The
cuisine makes life one beautiful idyll, and
the manager’s tact can be estimated from his
having captured the livers of Max O’Rell, Lord
Hopetoun, Parson Talmage, Parson Haweis, Prize-
fighter S'ullivan, Judge A., Judge 8., Judge C.,
and Judge D. One and all of these celebrities
have given the manager testimonials, which prove
that the Australian cuisine and attention fairly
mashed them. To sum up, the Australia is better
located for business or pleasure than any other
hotel in the Southern Hemisphere, and every
visitor tostimonialises it in the spirit, if not in the
words of Sarah Bernhardt: “May each traveller
find the same welcome and feel the same pleasure
in entering this hotel.” *
Looking backwards is not always a plea-
sure, any more than looking forward, although at
times, with some of us, both are a delight. In
retrospecting the advances of the last decade we
must notice the development of smoking, which
has now become with some men almost a science.
From the good old clay and strong-flavored Irish
twist of 10 years ago, we have advanced stride by
stride until a stage has been reached which seems
the zenith of epicurean desires. In Frossard’s
Cavour Cigars, which are the latest innovation,
we have a delicious, fragrant, mild, and aromatic
smoke, which have the nicotine extracted “in
vacuo ” by a process known only to the manu-
facturers ; the leaf is by this means freed
from every injurious element, and the smoker
enjoys all the fragrance of the tobacco without
any of the effects of nicotine. Looking forward
to the future, onegcanuot see how this invention
can be improved upon both scientifically and
economically, for these cigars are now retailed
all over Australasia in neat packages of 8, and are
the best possible value procurable. If any reader
of this paragraph has not yet enjoyed them, he
should do so at once. Heavy smokers should try
them. Young ladies should request their lovers
to indulge in nothing else. Mothers should advise
their sons to smoke only Frossard’s Cavour Cigars,
and we are sure that they will soon thank us for
the good advice.*
SHODDY.
Some side-lights are thrown on the wool-trade in
an interesting article which appeared in the
Leader, written by Mr. Synnot, of The National
Wool Co., Melbourne. Commenting on the causes
of the low prices for wool, the point taken is that
the frequently-recurring market collapses are not
caused by over-production, but are the outcome of
the introduction of other subsidiary matter such
us cotton and shoddy. Assuming that the practice
of mixing shoddy with our pure wool can be
limited, the prospects for the woolgrower are
encouraging, and it is to be hoped that all the
colonies will pull together and insist that importa-
tions of woollen goods, tweeds, blankets, etc., be
hall-marked, and the honest manufacture certi-
fied to by responsible trade boards.*

The recent Vic. Supreme Court decision re the
range of bills-of-sale has “ consternated ’’ Southern brew-
ing circles. Hitherto, a bill-of-sale was considered to
cover for 12 months (when It had to be renewed) the stock
of the hotel under lien. It has now been ruled that it
only applies to the stock particularised in '‘the notice of
intention to file;” and any interfering with the stock, prior
to the passing of the b.s., in all probability invalidates
the latter. If the Pull Court maintains this view, the
brewer and the wine-and-spirit merchant will have no hold
worth a cent over a grantor of a b.s., who, in most cases,
is worth little after paying his ingoing; the grantors
viewing subsequently-acquired stock as their property,
whilst the b.s. remains unpaid. Prom the grantor’s point
of view the new ruling is satisfactory, as it will give many
a miserable who has been lured into investing his all in
some far-over-valued pub., a chance to save something
from the wreck when payment-on-demand is enforced.

When next ?the N.S.W. Local Government
Bill turns up (say 25 years hence), It should provide that
all municipal accounts shall be overhauled by a State
auditor, and that wherever a municipality has an over-
draft at its banker’s, or its accounts show a deficiency for
the year, the auditor should have power to strike a special
rate, up to a certain fixed limit, the proceeds of which
must go to meet the shortage. Most of the embarrassed
local bodies are embarrassed simply because they won’t
tax themselves sufficiently to cover ordinary expenses.
Some of the Vio. municipalities that are now praying for
more State aid to save them from bankruptcy have lately
ndueed their taxation from Is. to 9d. in the £, and are
suspected of making such absurdly low valuations that
the alleged 9d. amounts in reality to barely 6d.

The creditors of the Australian Mortgage and
Deposit Bank have finally agreed to reconstruct on the
following basis : 10 per cent, of the deposits to be repaid
next January ; 10 per cent, without interest in Jan.,
1899; 10 per cent, without interest in Jan., 1901; the
other 70 per cent., with interest at the rate of 3J per
sent, annually, to be paid in 1911 if possible, but the bank
to have the right of renewing two-thirds of the amount
until 1916. Which is about the slowest reconstruction on
record.

The Bulletin knows of one landholder who
will get a very bad shock when the land-tax arrives.
About 20 years ago this person let a piece of ground, in
a then remote suburb, on a very long lease—so long that
Ins grandson may possibly see'the end of it if he is of a
robust constitution, bnt not otherwise. The lessee said
lie meant to grow turnips on the property, but no veget-
ables were specified in the lease, though the ground
was let at market-gardening rates. That lessee promptly
bni't a terrace—one of the longest terraces in Sydney—on
the property, and a boom set in, and a big suburb grew
up, and land went up like a balloon thereabouts. The
value has risen so much that all the rent which the owner
receives won’t cover the land-tax, and, if values keep in-
ceasing, as they probably will, the property will be a
bigger and bigger loss for 40 years or so. It is’ impossible
to sell a property and almost impossible to give it
away with such an incubus on it, unless the owner gives
it to the church, which doesn’t pay land-tax. Obviously,
in such cases - and there are probably a good many of the
kind in a more or less aggravated shape—the leaseholder
should be got at by the State, but there is no provision in
the Land-Tax Bill for getting at him in any form.
• • • *
The Land and Income-Tax Bill got through all
its crucial stages, in N.S.W, Assembly, without a single
question being asked about those glaring and sinful dis-
crepancies—the exemption of church lands from the land-
tax, and the exemption from income-tax of the foreign
holder of N.S.W. debentures while the local holder has to
pay up. Also, no one called attention to the fact that
the foreign mortgagee is exempted from absentee-tax,
though the foreign landholder isn’t; that, though the
absentee private landholder is specially taxed, in a very
small way, it is true, the absentee landholding co., which
is twenty> times more important, apparently is not.
Also, though the absentee who derives his income from
land is specially taxed, the one who derives his income
from other sources isn’t—there is no absentee income-
tax in the hill at all.

The N.S.W. railways and tramways paid, for
the year ended 30th June, ’95. £3 I2s. per cent, on the
cost of construction, against £3 9s. 2d. for the previous
12 months, and, but for the exorbitant rate at which
money was borrowed for construction purposes, they
would now be returning a handsome profit. As it is, the
deficit is very small, and is being steadily reduced.
The return of £3 12s. per cent, is the best that has been
realised since 1884. The total receipts (£3,160,520) are
£68.785 more than last year, while the working expenses
( £1.798,682) are £22,543 less, so that the net revenue has
increased by £91,328. On the railways, working expenses
now amount to rather under 54i per cent, of the entire
takings, the lowest rate since *lBBl. These results have
been achieved despite the fact that there has lately been
bung round the neck of the Department the Lismore-
Tweed railway, which shows a loss of £26,827, and the
Sydenham-Belmpre line representing a ins* of £8277, and
that a further loss (amount unstated) has been incurred
by the Ocean-street cable tramway, and by a number of
reductions in freights and fares. Altogether, the savings
madeduring the last seven years under the Eddv regime
may he roughly estimated at £2,790,000—in other words,
the railway system has paid that amount more to the
Treasury than it would have done if things had continued
on the 1888 basis. The man who has produced these re-
sults is not dear at £3OOO a year—nor at £6OOO.

The low salaries paid to their'valuators and

The Victorian deficit for the past year proves
to be only £42,000 instead of £114.000. as previously
announced. It is the custom in Victoria to make an
allowance, at the close of the financial year, for unpaid
liabilities, and now that all (he accounts have come in.
Premier Turner finds that he allowed £72,000 more (hau
was necessary. They don’t do tilings in this fashion in
the other two eastern provinces. Queensland leaves out-
standing liabilities to lie paid next year. N.S. Wales now
travels on a “ cash basis,” so that everything which isn’t
paid during the year goes into next account, even many
of the civil service salaries for June being shunted into
next year on the ground that they are not payable till Ist
July.

There have lately been published financial cable-

Although there is every convenience for the
receipt of deposits at Sydney and suburban Post-office
Savings-banks, wiihdrnwalscan only be made from 10 a.m.

Most of the new local depositors of the City of
Melbourne Bank got the tip in time and came in out of
the drought. There was nothing that could he called a
run—it was more like a crawl—hut, in an unobtrusive
fashion, the hulk of the public managed to be in time.
The management probably is not sorry. A feeling of
bitter aggravation at the Scotch depositor is the prevail-
ing sentiment,, and the less there is to divide when he
comes down in his rage and hie kilt the better a good
many people will like it.

The United Steamship Co. (Tasmania) is think-
ing of going out of the business. This luckless concern
has paid just two riivs. in 30 years, and its history shows
that energy and pluck and a profound faith in the good

the unreliable copy-book that we used to get whacked
for spilling the ink-hottle over in the happy days of child-
hood.

The Federal Coffee Palace (Molb.)had a revenue
for the last half-year of £7382, and the loss was £7Ol.
The directorate announces once more that nothing hut a
liquor-license will meet the case. The assets are now
nearly £17,000 less than the liabilities, and the freehold
property is taken at its book-value (£149,000) at that. Its
real value just now could hardly amount to £lOO,OOO.

_ Melbourne Mutual Store shows a profit of
£2070 for the half-year, after making allowances for

tainly, but decidedly better than its recent experiences.

Existing mortgages in Maoriland total
£30,571,000. Of this amount Canterbury—population

Sydney D.T., referring to the Illawarra smelt-
ing scheme, says : “ It is gratifying to know that the
sulphide problem has been solved by a citizen of
Sydney”—meaning Dr. Storer. At the same time it is
painful to know that any newspaper can say the sulphide
problem is solved many months before any possible
attempt can he made to prove it. The problem can
never be held solved in the laboratory or with any model
plant, and judgment on the scheme must he suspended
until details arrive. The gush about building a new city
and ocean-steamer jetties, making a great harbor, buying
mines notable for the absence of sulphide ore, and
spending two millions a year in wages, sounds very well,
but—the Illawarra crowd are good advertisers.

There's life in the Cremorne coal boomers. They
have let shaft-contracts to the extent of £60,000, and
involved themselves in other big financial obligations. In
Australia, no time is lost in spending J. Bull’s money.
In Oippsland, where the coal-speculators have to spend
at least some of their own, and the coal, though shallow,
is subject to numerous faults, they keep a number of
drills going to locate the seams beyond doubt ere they start
shafts or other workings. In Sydney Harbor, the Cre-
morne people (with quite as much of the N.S.W. Govt,
money as their own) put down two deep bores, one of
which struck burnt—and, therefore valueless —coal ; the
■other good coal. Then they went to London right away.
Sensible boomers! To put down more bores and chance
finding more burnt coal wight be their funeral; now it
would be Mr. Bull’s. But what a downy duck Bull must
be not to find out where “he are ” with a lot more bores
ere spending a quarter-of-a-million in shafts, etc. ! Let us
hope, however, it will turn out all right. There is every
reason to believe in the existence of good seams—hut, a
lot of Scotchmen working the show “on their own”
■would surely have bored a lot more ere sinking.

C. B. Fisher, the insolvent Melbourne squatter,
reports that since 1882 he paid the banks £591,000 in dis-
counts and interest on overdrafts, and owed them
£590,000 for interest alone at the time of his insolvency.
If this amount has been reckoned among the assets, it
means another heavy knock to some badly-bruised insti-
tutions.

Coal is again said to have been found in the
Cooktown district. What’s it’s heating power? Good
coal would be a godsend to the Northern goldfields. At
present coal costs upwards of £2 per ton on the Towers,
and there is not a tree above four feet high to be found
within 10 miles of the town, the rest having gone to
the furnaces. No wonder the local rainfall is scanty.

The practice of brokers transferring shares in
rocky concerns to their office-boys was shown up in the
insolvency case of Henry Darling, an ex-office-boy, in
Melbourne, the other day. Henry was encumbered with
an accumulation of liabilities amounting to about £2600,
all calls due upon shares in financial Institutions (mostly
bung) which shares had been fastened upon him in the
course of business when he was a defenceless junior clerk
in the office of a city broker. Transference is no robbery.

Recent experiences of cattle-shipment prove
that cattle for export must he young and not heavy
beasts. Overcrowding in the pens on hoard results in
overheating and death. Green-hide should be used for
halters, and not ripe, which shrinks when wet with rain
or spray and causes discomfort. Unless a larger per-
centage of stock than that, landed from the Southern
■Cross last week reaches Europe in good condition,
exporters will only burn their fingers.

During the first eight months of '95 the cash

During Ang. there was a decrease of .£36,261 in

money (interest is only given on £250) with the object of
making it appear that the State Advances Bill is frighten-

The South Australian Co. —that famous associa-

obtained an enormous land-grant in S.A. on its solemn
assurance that it would not use the properly for money-
making purposes—is paying the respectable div. of 9 per
cent. Last year it paid 11 per cent., and for the seven
years 1887 93 it paid 13 per cent, annually. The only
good feature in the case is the steady reduction in the
dividend, and it is to he hoped that the graduated land-
tax will keep it down for the future.

At Lefroy (Tas.), the reefs are often pheno-
menally rich near the surface, hut the payable gold,
apparently, doesn’t live to a depth. Years ago several
co’s shut down after paying big divs. Discoveries of new
reefs have brought the field to the front, and two co’s
have received funds for proving their lodes at a depth.
The Pinafore, whilst crosscutting at 800 ft., is still sinking;
and the Volunteer is also going down. Goldatadjpth
would revolutionise things at Lefroy, as there are several
known auriferous lodes on the field. One of these carries
a few dwts. at 800 ft.

A syndicate of Sydney men, after much deli-

there are two other reefs which have never been opened.

The proposal of theN.S.W. Mines Minister to
encourage prospecting by erecting batteries is not too bad,
providing that the sites are left to the judgment of

the fields have failed, as many will, and that they are run
by hard-headed, horny-handed battery men—free from

The resurrection of Cobar as a mining-camp is
due to the five N.S. W. men who last year took the big
copper-mine t here on tribute ; and of these the hero is
Longworth. Throwing aside the old system of smelting
with reverberatory furnaces, they adopted water-jackets,,
and are now running two. Their output is about 4000
tons a month, and the mining, heap roasting, smelting,
refining and wood-carting give steady work to hundreds
of men, and require more than half the total freight of
the Cobar railway. With copper lower than the co. could
ever work the mine to pay, they pay the co. a royalty
and themselves good divs. They have also managed to
secure half the shares in the old co. The gold contents
of the ore average over £2O for each ton of refined
copper. The co. was blissfully ignorant of its existence!
It turned nut copper to the value of a million, paid
£154,000in divs., and threw—or rathergave—away the gold.
The old directors will now' know why Oohar copper was so
appreciated in Swansea. The divs. about equal the gold
they gave away.

Probably the most distressed mining man in
N.S. W. to-day is Supt. Stewart, of B.H. Proprietary. A
month ago he said the fire was out; half-a-dozen times
since he has said the same thing. Every few days a shaft
is going to be opened “next week.” Still the gas con-
tinues to be poured into the mine ; and every time they
disturb the surface over the affected part smoke escapes.
By those who know how difficult a thing it is to
set a big log, even of light wood, blazing where the
draught is poor, it ought to be remembered that many of
the timbers in the affected part of the B.H. Proprietary
have been much crushed and splintered by creeps.
Following on the fire underground at the B.H.
Proprietary carae the burning of the sorting and dressing
floors and bins at the neighboring Block 10. Nor is that
the only outbreak of fire at the Hill. The B.H. Proprie-
tary concentrating plant, the B.H. Junction engine-house,
the South’s buildings—all, and perhapi others, have been
scorched. At Broken Hill they are uneasy about it.
Supt. Stewart, of the B.H. Proprietary, appa-
rently isn’t bound hand and foot to the Tarrawingee Flux
Co. Tenders are called at the Hill for raising 9000 cubic
yards of limestone flux from leases which the 00. has
acquired in the district.
The old Umberumberka mine, one of the oldest
company-properties on the Barrier, sold to the Silverton
Tram. Co. recently, is to be worked on tribute.
The B.H. North is sending 500 tons of sul-
phides to the B.H. South concentrators, in order that it
may be better ascertained what particular class of mill
and treatment is most suitable. When it is ascertained,
a mill will be erected on the mine.
B.H. Junction North sulphides to date are
largely mixed with sandstone.
For the weekended Sept. 7 the mines at Broken
Hill, other than the B.H. Proprietary, concentrated or
shipped 6857 tons, all but 300 tons of which were sul-
phides. The Central dealt with 1634 tons ; Block 14 with
1200 tons (besides ore bought); the South with 1178 tons.
The B.H. Proprietary during the same week smelted or
amalgamated 8197 tons. Total quantity of ore dealt with
during the week, 14,264 tons.

Dear Bulletin, —A glimpse of Wyalong—from
the inside. Miners’ rights everywhere here, and every-
thing done by contract at starvation prices. Shaft-sink-
ing to 100 ft. Is. 6d. and 2s. per foot; driving levels and
sloping quartz at prices in proportion. Tributes are (aken
at 50, 55, and, in some cases, 75 per cent, above loz. per
ton—tributors to find timber, tools, &c. As for wages,
there are men working for from 15s. up to £2 10s. per
week ; so the bona-fide miner, as represented here, isn’t a
big improvement on the syndicator. There are at present
about 12 claims paying ; but ns they are mostly working
on short shoots of gold, don’t he surprised to see them
dwindle down to half in six months. Several are under
the loz. now.—Miner.

Parliament are interested in the syndicate which has
bought, and is trying to float into a co., the Angipena
Treasure mine, near Beltana. A recent bulk crushing of
4i tons is said to have yielded 18oz. gold.

Charters Towers August return—22,4s3 tons for
23,0050 z. For the eight months of this year, 169,288 tons
for 169,7150 z. Present outlook points to this year passing
nil previous records. Mt Morgan, for the month, 7479
tons, 11,119 >z., usual 6d. div. The shares are quoted on
the London market at 575., which makes the mine out to
be W'orth £2,850,000.

The Auckland, M.L., mining-boom, writes The
Bulletin s local correspondent, lias come to stay.
During Aug., 18,000 acres were pegged out in the Thames
and Ohinemuri districts; also large areas at Kunolonn
and Coromandel. Every day two or three claims are
floated (usually as no liability co’s), and nromot rs’
shares are invariably over-applied for. A good feature is
that vendors get little cash, the money subscribed going
chiefly to development. The whole Thames Coromandel
p miimula, which contains large quantities of stone that
should pay with cyanide, will now be thoroughly pros-
pected.
The yield of bullion for July was valued at
£35,000. Figures for August not yet complete, but
should he nhout the same, principal yields being:
Waihi, £9519; Haurnki, £8900; Crown, £2200; Mav
Queen, £2100; Woodstock, £883; Wailikauri, £728; Try
Fluke, £765. .
Kapai-Vermont is looking well and is getting
good stone in large quantities. The yield for this month
(Sept.) should be worth close on £BOOO. The co. has a big
reef, which will keep it going for years.
The Grown, at Karangahake, is a steady bullion -
producer, and should shortly pay divs. The 00. has
£25,000 In hand for development of property and erection
of more machinery ; there is enough payable dirt in sight
to keep battery going for 18 months. As the surplus on
a month’s work is about £l2OO, the 00. is getting into a
snug position. The shares (80,000, 17s. paid), held chiefly
in Glasgow, are quoted at 425.
Waihi, Silverton, is opening up well. The reef
has been struck. A 20-head battery will be ready for
work end of Oct., and first cleaning-up should be about
Christmas. On present prospects the mine should turn
out £BOOO worth of bullion monthly. Shares, 20s. paid,
are readily saleable at 635.
Waihi co. have cut the Martha reef on the low
level. Reef 18ft. thick, and several assays, including
those of the poor section of the lode, average £3 ss. per
ton. The 00. pays a quarterly div. of 2s. this month.

The 3cwt. of specimens from the Amos mine,
N.S. W., have arrived, and are on exhibition in Sydney.
Very rich they are, but the proper place for their exhibi-
tion is London. Gold attracts gold, but there must be
some to attract, and J. Bull has lots.

Another sensational find reported from Cool-
gardie. This time at Mount Margaret, where, it is said,
some prospectors have dollied out 200 oz. and have £l6OO
in specimens.

“If one could only believe the whole of the
Great Boulder yarns,” writes The Bulletin’s London cor-
respondent, “there would be a boom in Wesiralians
which would be difficult to check. As it is, Zeb. Lane is
not the absolute idol of .the public." Since this was
written, the boom lias started, and, as mines change men
more than times, Zeb. Lane must be regarded as the
reigning favorite, the mining lion of the hour, who oould
float anything to which he attached his name.

W.A. gold-returns for August: Coolgardie,

The public are tired of the semi-weekly Oool-
gnrdie wire about the Golden Bar crushing and cyanide
plant wmrking splendidly, while the crushing (it has
already lasted two months) will be 4 to 6oz. to the ton.

In the general thirst and hunger for gold the
newspapers are up-to-date with a daily sensation. The
best this week is a find near Ararat, Vic.: “ The first dish-
ful gave an oz. of gold, and every foot sunk it was richer
until it reached 7oz. to the dish, until at last lib. of gold
was washed from a dish of stuff.” Five tons of (hit
“ took ” is bagged ; armed men are watching the claim,
and the owner declines all offers.

ment which will not be.easily checked after the holidays

Unionism as practised on the Murchison. When
the Cue Victory co. spoke of erecting a battery and
crushing for the public, many small claims reserved their
stone for the plant. But the C.V. 00. reduced the wages
of all surface hands from £3 10s. to £3 per week, and as
nearly all public crushing comes from small claims run by
working miners, the co. (up to date) has never done a
pound of public crushifig, and its battery has been idle
for three months, after working only six weeks on the
go’s own stone.
• ~* • *
Another dodge in mine-flotation. Jones, who
has a duffer on hand, begs, borrows or steals’TOOoz
gold, and dumps it into the hank as the product of his
mine. A few days later he takes it out and replace sitby n
slightly varied parcel (more or less). Repeats this process
ad lib, and then solids Vhome” hank receipts showing
say, 3000 oz. from the Bound to Bust gold-mine. Re ult—
triumphant flotation. ’

“Alick” Forrest has declared that the W.A.
Govt, has finally decided to extend the Cnolgnidie rail-
way on to Hannan’s, and "Alick” ought to know.
“This has caused great jubilation.” Where? Noi in
Ooolgardie, surely! If Hannan’s is made the terminus
then may Heaven save Coolgardie, for the gold-mines
close by certainly won’t.
♦ * * *
How many lb. to a W.A. ton? Some evidence
on the point was given in a rtoent case at Coolgardie.
Witness: “The arrangement was to show a larger \ hid
from a small.r quantity of stuff.” An examinntio of
the battery books showed that several other transactions
of a similar nature had taken place. Big tons for little
mines.

poor the managers generally say so.
At the Florence-Moody-Hambourg Concert
Company’s matinee, in Melbourne, last Wednes-

stylish hats worn by these distinguished artistes
were supplied by Messrs. Hicks, Atkinson and
Sons. Miss Florence’s gown was of pretty spotted
muslin, elaborated with pink, and trimmed w ith
quantities of soft, foamy lace-the tout entimllc
being very effective. A picture-hat of black lan

of exquisite taste and perfect fit, relieved with

he knew it in 1868 when he represented the S. W.

days all dead, but all the officers and employes
about the House are also deceased with the excep-
tion of the Clerk of Parliament and two other

Mr. Justice Hodges is

graphy of him to be found
in any of the reference-hooks
—neither in the “colonial

nial Gentry,” nor else-
where, He has always
persisted in refusing to
supply particulars about
himself for publication. He
was born in 1845—one year
after Chief Justice Madden,
and a year before Mr. Jus-
tice Hood.
The late Vic. Justice
Barry, when visiting Wan-
garatta on circuit, always
stayed with a certain J.P.
One day his J.P. friend sat
beside him on the bench,
and the prisoner, asked by
his Honor whether anyone
could speak as to his char-
acter, replied—“ Yes ; Mr.
J.P. there knows me. I’ve
worked for him.” Then
began theJ.P., “Ob, yes,
your Honor, I’ve known”
. The dignified Judge
waved his hand, “Excuse
me, sir, will you please
enter the witness-box?”
Tins made the Jaypee
angry, hut he boxed him-
self. and started off again
“ Oh, yes, I’ve ” .
Another wave of the judi-
cial hand. “ Excuse me,
sir ; you’re not sworn. Con-
stable, swear this witness.”
The oath was taken, and
J.P. made another start,
only to be again stopped by
Barry. “ Witness, what is
your name?” That fin-
ished him. He started pro-
fanity, when the Judge—
“ Sir, I will have no
swearing here; fined one
pound for contempt of
finrt. Stand down, sir.”
He stood down, paid bis
fine, went out, and swore
for an hour by the clock
But the Judge dined with
him that night, as usual.
A correspondent : —There is no truth in
the published report of the reconciliation between
Hori Grey and bis long-estranged wife. Lord
Stamford, a relative of the great pro-Consul s,
took great pains to bring about an understanding,
but failed. He invited Grey to his house, and in
the old man’s bedroom, by way of a “feeler,
placed a portrait of Lady Grey. The veteran was
greatly affected when he recognised the picture,
and expressed a willingness to be reconciled,
Lady Grey, however, refused his advances. She
reßented the stiKma that had been placed on her
, . , v
character, and considered that the smallness of
the allowance made to her (4150 per annum) had
been an act of unnecessary cruelty.
Ada Cambridge (Mis. Cross,
wife of a Williamstown vieur)
greatly objects to being “ inter-
viewed.” She writes, in answer
to a recent application from a
Melb. duly ; “Though I like all
possible publicity for my books.
I greatly shrink from it_in other
ways, preferring as the author of
them to live out of sight as much
as possible, particularly not to
attract notice by what may look
like self-advertisement in the place
where I live.”
Miss Elizabeth Reddall, the
oldest native inhabitant of Camp-
oelltown, N.S.W., and a connect-
ing link with the days of the
“ System,” died last week in that
town, where she lived all her life,
at the age of 73. Campbell town
was named by Gov. Macquarie in
1820, at which time he appointed
Rev. Thomas Reddall chaplain
Ur the district. Miss Elizabeth
Reddall was the parson’s seventh
daughter, and well remembered
the “ pomp and circumstance ” of
the official entry of Chief Justice
Forbes to open the first local
Assize Court. The procession
started from Liverpool, and con-
sisted of troopers with drawn
swords, the sheriff and his officers,
the chaplain (Mr. Reddall), 20
carriages “filled with gentlemen.’’
50 horsemen also assumed to be
gentlemen, and 100 “persons cn
foot,” the latter presumably not
gentlemen. Though hut a child
when the apparition was seen, she
well remembered the excitement
ovef “Fisher’s ghost,” which s
still a stock story in Campbell-
town.
The Argus sub editor and all his myrmi-
dons couldn’t make bead or tail of a certain leader,
and it was taken back to the author, the illegible
Willoughby. Willoughby stared at the slip fur
five minutes and seemed hopelessly fogged him-
self. Eventually a meaningful “ Ah-h !” pro-
claimed the mystery solved. “Why, confound
it,” he said, “I’ve been looking at the blessed
thing upside-down.”
Mrs. Mannington Caffyn, it appears, sold
the copyright of “The Yellow Aster”—lock,
stock and barreh-Tor <£Bo. After the publication
of the fourth edition of the book, however, her
publishers made her a present of <£loo. That’s one
yarn. But one of the Hutchinsons, who published
tfie “ Disaster,’.’ was in Australia three mouths
ago, and told a Sydney man that Mrs. C. hud
netted upwards of £BOO by the boi k, while his

“The Banjo,” a lifelike portrait of whom
(by Freeman), printed herewith, will interest a very
wide circle, hopes to see his book (“The Man

about a month from date. The first edition,
which will he sent forth by Messrs. Angus and

POLITICAL POINTS
The Victorian pension-list is about sd. a
week per taxpayer.
Our usual Queensland leper has been
found—in the Burdekin district this week.
Engineer Bulcock (Q.) approaches opposi-
tion candidates with offers of support if only they
will renounce the Labor-party.
Mrs. Mary Lee and Miss Spence decline
to accept tbe Parliamentary nominations offered
them by the S. A. Labor Plebiscite.
Premier Turner’s brilliant success may
direct one’s mind to Deakin, the academic, who
had the ball at his foot, but gave Turner a little
mark.
The recent “ rowdy ” anti-sweating meet-
ing, at Mclb. Town Hall, forcibly suggests the
need for election of Mayors by the citizens, as in
America.
The average direct cost to Government of
Sydney unemployed is something over £lOOO per
month. The first six months of present year
totalled £6319.
John Downer, Q.C., professes to be sick of
politics, and says that he will probably stand out
next year. He is tired of Kingston’s monopoly
of theS.A. bremiership.
“Mr. M’Millan threw his brickbat at the
monotony of it from under the glass roof of one
of the oldest temples of bathetic boredom.” —
“ Outis ” in Sydney Telegraph.
There are signs of trouble between S.A.
land-taxers and tlie Labor-party. Henry Taylor,
one of the foremost land-taxers, lias refused to be
nominated as a Labor candidate for 1896 election.
A Vie. M.P. has fairly aroused the
country to tlie advantages of a State tobacco
monopoly. A Parliamentary Committee is ap-
pointed to consider the question. Drink will
follow the smoke.
The Maoriland House of Representatives
has passed a Bill abolishing the attachment of
wages for debt. The theory is steadily gaining
ground that the State shouldn't be an agency for
collecting anybody’s bad debts.
The Kwong Yick Wah 80, the Sydney
Chinese paper, asserts that through the operation
of Cliinese Restriction legislation iu N.S. W.
Cuiuese agricultural labor is more highly-paid
than European and black-labor.
Premier Kingston protests his sincerity as
a law reformer, and has prepared a measure which
will opeu tlie eyes of even laymen. But the time
is not yec ripe. Law reform will hit lawyers
Symon and Downer in a soft place when election-
time comes.
A metropolitan candidate at last N.S. VV.
election, when asked what he had done during
the 12 months he had been iu Parliament,
answered glibly, “ I have obtained the promise to
build a lock-up in the electorate !” They enthu-
siastically re-elected him.
Q. election gossip : Premier Nelson is to
contest MTlwratih’s seat in North Brisbane, and
Morelmad has refused nomination fur Murauoa.
Huolau will contest Cairns, while T. J. Byrnes
bus an eye on Fortitude Valley. Lilley is to run
for Cunningham ; and Glassey fur Lockyer.
M’Millan has evidently returned to be a
thorn iu tlie side of the Reid Government. “I
am a consistent Freetrader,” said tlie little man
from Burwood (equivalent to “ 1 am a consistent
importer ”); but, all the same, his first speech was
a savage attack on the Reid Ministry, hardly
relieved by a single gleam of approval.
The Victorian sweaters are making a hard
fight against the Govt, minimum wage—con-
tractors engaging men at stipulated rates and
deducting a certain amount weekly for the use of
tools. Paperhaiignig is not yet listed us a mini-
mum wage trade, so another tavurite device is to
employ alleged papel hangers at low wages to do
all sorts of work.
Why should N.S.W. minor Judge Back-
house (Who is removeable at the behest of the
Ministry) be appointed to review the case of
Johnson, in which Supreme Court Justices
Wnideyor and Darley are concerned? —Mr. Win-
deyer having committed the man for alleged per-
jury, and Mr. Darley having tried him. The
situation is an absolutely monstrous one.
One large N.S.W. proprietor objects to
the Land-Tax because it is directly aimed at the
big landlords, a class “who have made N.S.W.
what it is.” This is satisfactory in one sense.
The people who have made N.S.VV. what it is
want to be hanged with all possible speed. The
difficulty hitherto has been to identify them, but
when a big land-holder confesses that he and his
kind are the guilty parties, there is no visible
reason for further delaying the execution.
The N.S. VV. Director of Agriculture, in a
report lo the Legislature, recommends that the
present sugar-duties be retained, and that central
mills bo erected to help along the industry.
There is a very large extent of land, he states,
suitable for sugar-growing, and under the central-
mill system the business might expand enor-
mously, but if the duly is removed the probable
result will be a complete collapse. In short, the
N.S. VV. Government’s own expert reports in effect
that the Government is an ass.
To a deputation asking for the reduction
of Sydney tram-fares, on the ground that ’bus
fares were now largely reduced, N.S. W. Railway
Commissioner Oliver gave some well-deserved
thrusts. He reminded the interviewers that
’buses had no roadway to construct, and that the
’busmen worked many hours a day for very little
money—if the trams were run on the same prin-
ciples, the fares could be much lowered. After
that the deputation withdrew speechless and dis-
gusted, as several of its number were known to
be more or less mixed up in the ’bus industry.
Tlie Commissioner’s view of this fare-reduction
question is the true democratic one.
As bearing upon the anti-alien movement
now again assuming political significance in N.S.
Wales, the fact may be mentioned that in France
no foreigner is allowed to serve the State except
in the capacity of street-sweeper. Even in that
work, foreigners must not exceed one-tenth of the
total body thus employed. In French State
schools the cultivation of the English language
has of late gained a prominent place, and efforts
were made in a few quarters to have the language
taught by an Englishman, but after a brief wranglt
the ruling was given that as Italians are nor
allowed to teach Italian in these schools, soneithee
should Englishmen be allowed to teach English—
always, of course, excepting naturalised foreigners.
Young Parkes (son of old Parkes), with the
Sydney unemployed deputation : “Couldn’t you
spend .£200,000 in forest clearing at once, and get
the sanction of Parliament afterwards?” Of
course. What does Parliament exist for except to
give its sanction afterwards? But The Bulletin
hopes that some day, when a Government has
spent £200,000 on its own authority, Parliament
won’t give its sanction afterwards, and will
demand that the money be repaid, and, if it isn’t
forthcoming, will sell up the tables and chairs and
other belongings of each Minister and make him
insolvent. Then Parliament will begin for the
first time to get some control over the public ex-
penditure. At present it does little save shake a
retrospective fist at the inevitable.
Under the Reid (N.S. VV,)alleged Freetiade
tai iff, the duty on oils doesn’t wholly disappear until
July, 1897 ; that on candles until July, 1899 ; the
duties on biscuits, confectionery, fruits, jams,
jellies and preserves are not to be wholly removed
until July, 1900; and the sugar-duty vanishes in
July, 1901. The Reid party alleges that Protec-
tion raises prices—except when it alleges that it is
Freetrade that raises prices; and, therefore, it
would seem that it proposes to handicap the
N.S. W. manufacturers of biscuits, confectionery,
jams, jellies, etc., by making them pay a duty on
sugar for 12 months, during which they must
compete with imported goods made with sugar
that doesn’t pay duty! If the Reid party believes
in its own theory, the duties should come off
simultaneously.
Scraps from the report of last week’s
Sydney unemployed deputation. Varney Parkes,
M.L.A. (cast-iron Foreign-trader): “The Govern-
ment would have to find employment for 12,000
men.” Whiddon, M.L.A. (cast-iron Foreign-
trader) : “ Couldn’t the Government get an
advance from some fund and immediately start
forest-thinning?” Hughes, M.L.A. (cast-iron
Foreign-trader); “Employment could lie found
in pulling down condemned buildings.” Varney
Parkes; “Why couldn’t they spend £100,000?
There was no reason why the Government should
not go beyond the law and ask Parliament after-
wards. . . . Cannot you at once spend
£200,000 on forest-thinning?” Hughes; “You
can start the work of clearing settlements at once.”
Premier Reid : “If the Upper House blocks the
Loan Bill I will do something or other, . . .
I will galvanise them at once. ... I am
determined that at once the wheels will begin to
go round.” What consolation fur tbe 12 000 unem-
ployed to know that tbe Premier is going to do
something or other 1
IN A MELBOURNE COURT.
MICHAEL O'HOOLIGAN O'HARA (charged with assaulting Moses Zerenhoom, bookmaker, in the
execution of his duty — sold.) : “ Live an’ larn! It’s mesilf has offen been bothered
to know fwhoi thim Jay Pays was called ‘beaks.' ”
The Thursday Island Japs are “ ram-
pageous” at the action of Mr. Satow, of the
Japanese Chib, who has gone home to arrange for
a further immigration from Japan. The Thurs-
day Island Jap sees clearly that this means
reduced wages for him. At a recent meeting of
the club, the old committee was called upon to
resign, and one member was violently assaulted.
If the A.L.F. cared to send an organiser North,
it could easily enlist the Japs under its
banner, and gain an ally to the cause of Australia
for the Australians.
“ The remainder of my life,” says Mr.
M'Millan, M.P. (N.S.W.), “will be taken up iu
studying the great industries of this country, and
making this country what it is destined to be for
the next 30 years—one of the great food-providers
of the world.” Happy prospect! The Corn-
stalk’s destiny is to milk cows and grow pork for
J. Bull. Also, to wear J. Bull’s shoddy.
MAIDEN INNOCENCE.
SHE: “ Tell me, Jack, do they weigh the horses first, or the jockeys,
or both together! ”
Again the walk-abnut Kanaka. It is now
suggested that restrictive legi-iation be intro-
duced from the West Indies, for the benefit of
Tommy Tanna. In Jamaica, no coolie or Chinese
plantation-laborer is allowed to enter or visit any
other plantation without a pass from bis employer
for a certain date, under penalty of being arrested.
Note the countries Bananaland looks to for legis-
lative examples !
When the fitness of a Ministry to hold
office is challenged by Parliamentary resolution,
it suspends business until the indictment is dis-
posed of. This being so, wby should a Supreme
Court Judge, whose fitness to hold office is chal-
lenged, continue to exercise his functions ? Is the
lawyer-politician who manages to hoist himself on
to the Bench to be regarded as superior to the
Legislature of the country? Judge-worship has
gone a lot too far in Australia.
Under the new standing orders of N.S.W.
Assembly, a disorderly member is rushed right
out of the buildings and the grounds, and thrown
into Macquarie-street, whereas formerly he was
only ejected from the Chamber itself and left in
the refreshment-room. M'Elhone was the first
completely-thrown-out member under the new
system. The advantage is that other members
are no longer seized upon, every time they come
out for a smoke, by inflamed persons with ob-
jectionable breaths, who want to relate their
grievances at great length.
Murray Smith, combating Hancocks
efforts to restore the 20 per cent, duty upon cor-
sets in Vic. Assembly, declared that “ the reduced
duty would give relief to the working classes.”
Yet Murray Smith fought against the proposed
abolition of the rice-duty. He evidently believes
that the best way to stay the stomachs of the poor
is from the outside.
An Anarchist-club
existed iu Melbourne a
lustrum back. It had
rooms in the Alexandra
Theatre, in one of the
first-floor windows of
which was displayed a
flag with “ Liberty,
Equality, Fraternity ”
in red. Weekly debates
were held, and the club
rejoiced in the posses-
sion of two schools of
Anarchy—the active
and the passive. Women
orated there occa-
sionally, and one or two
not badly. Subjects
varied from the Refer-
endum to Oneida pro-
blems, and, with all its
defects, the club was an
oasis in the intellectual
desert of Melbourne.
Dear Bulletin, —
You draw attention to
tbe much-diminished
power of Sydney Muni-
cipal Council in the pre-
sentN.S.W. Parliament.
Time has certainly come
for the political aider-
man’s extermination.
He is a dead failure.
Aldermanie fat is not
and never has been the
kind of fat statesmen are
made of. For a com-
pletely abject example of
political failure look at
gilded Matt Harris, self-
centred as the metro-
politan municipal party
in the new Assembly.
Lees, Manning, and
Burdekin have had their
turns, and the ablest
politician of the three
was Burdekin, whose
superfluous cash atoned
for other deficiencies.
Fowler is banished lo
the State charnel-house
(yclept “ the oth e i
place”) and Martin,
Chapman, and Jeanne-
ret were three other per•-
sistent nonentities. Municipal apprenticeship
unfits men for anything larger than the supervision
of gutters.— Thorold.
Kingsbury, M.P. for North Brisbane, and
the glorified apostle of the cottage piano, will
have a tussle at next election. His mercurial
temperament makes him a constant source of
anxiety to local Pat Man, who fears he is not
“reliable.” He can’t be trusted to snore ster-
torously in the bar till the bell rings and then
suffer himself to be led gently to his seat. But
if he sometimes talks like a Democrat, he in-
variably votes like a Tory,
Agent-General Gillies, at a London ban-
quet “ Lord Brassey and the colonies, lam
sure, will work together to promote the benefit of
mankind and to favor human freedom.” Which
incoherent whoop boils down into the plain fact
that Lord Brassey will hang round in a quiet
unobtrusive manner and not look any more absurd
than he can help, and that the “colonies” will
plod along the best way they know how. Why
doesn’t Premier Turner cable Gillies to keep quiet
and get his hair cut ?
John M'Elhone was, as might have been
expected, the first man ejected from the present
N-S. W. Parliament for (leaving epithets at his
fellow-member. At the same time, the dear old
combustible John flatly denies having alluded to
[Fitzpatrick’s “evil eye.” He says that he spok**
of that politician’s 41 eagle eye,” but that the
chairman, being hard of hearing, called him to
order by mistake, and John, being also hard of
hearing, didn’t know lie was being called to order,
consequently he was run out in a state sf bewilder-
ment, and didn’t understand the situation till le
saw it explained in the morning-paper.
Adolph Csesar Shadier and Austin Chaj
man contested Braidwood electorate at last
N.S.VV. election, and Shadier got beaten. There-
upon Shadier summoned Chapman under the
Electoral Act for allowing one Meyer Levinsohn to
pay on his behalf for certain whisky given for the
purpose of corruptly influencing electors. In tin
course of the case (as reported in a daily paper'
a person, described as a reporter, admitted
“ that at the time of the alleged ‘ treating ’ he was
an officer of a local temperance lodge. He hac*
three glasses of spirits that evening.” Prosecutoi
Shadier said he saw Levinsohn paying for drinks ;
he considered that Levinsohn asked the men tc
drink in order to break up his meeting—us a
matter of fact he got no opportunity of expressing
his views. This is quite likely. From what The
Bulletin knows of Mr. Shadier it quite believes
that the ordinary elector would rather drink twice
than hear Mr. Shadier speak once. Also, there
is a lot more Adolph than Ccesar about Shadier
aforesaid.

SKIN DISEASE
CUBED BY
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla
Mr. Geo. W. Enrtner, Keezletown, Va.,
writes, as follows:
“ Shortly alter leaving college, I was troubled
with a skin disease which showed itself, first, at
the ankles. Physicians pronounced it eczema,
and treated me for that complaint. The erup-
tion crept slowly up my limbs, and on the body,
until it enveloped the whole frame. It gave me
infinite trouble with constant itching, casting off
of dry scales, and a watery liquid which would
exude from under the scales. I treated it for
over three years unsuccessfully, and was unable
to check it, until I began using Ayer’s Sarsapa-
rilla. I used three bottles of this medicine and
was completely cured —my skin becoming as
smooth and clear as before.”

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The waves come flawless from the hand of God,
Fresh, and for ever new, and all the ocean
Folds from the orient ecstacy’s emotion,
As if divinity for ever trod
Upon the infinite purple deep and broad ;
And every billow pours its one devotion
To die upon the shore in perfect motion,
White, chaste and shadowless in its last abode.
We, miserable, fallen on a time
Too much o’erwrought and prematurely old,
And only knowing grief is each day’s friend,
Do but despairingly adore the chime
Of the wild surges, chanting without end
Secrets of joy to human ears untold.

Tas. Govt, gives married men the prefer-
ence when engaging labor. Recently some work
was “out ” which called for skilled and unskilled

ever—viz., ss. per day.
Last Westminster Gazette has a singu-
larly original and un-newspapery article on the
British elections. First it points out how thin a
top-layer of the English manhood votes at all, or
is able to do so, in producing the national voice.
Next, it contends that all the party engineering,
which works these sensational swings of the
pendulum, is exerted on a comparatively small
floating mass of electors, of the most inferior class,
while the Radicals and Tories remain solid.
“ How many Australians know how to
make soup out of a kangaroo tail ? ” writes a
Bulletin correspondent. “In nine out of every
ten shops where these delicacies are sold, the
salesman will generously offer to skin the tail for
the customer before sending it to his residence,
and in 99 cases out of 100 the customer accepts the
kindly offer. The remaining genius generally
skins the tail himself in the back-yard, slicing it
off in junks as he would sharpen a pencil. Yet
the skin of the kangaroo tail is the one particular
part which it is highly necessary to preserve in
order to get the full advantage of its glutinous
nature. Kangaroo-tail soup, a skinned article, is
like the water a pound of chops has been boiled
in, while ‘ the real Mackay ’ is a dish fit for the
gods—if there be any such persons.” Ox-tail
soup would doubtless be much more glutinous if
founded chiefly on a basis of bullock-hide. Some
people cannot bring themselves to regard as soup
anything of less consistency than glue.

The Auckland (M.L.) Rescue Work Society
is an association of elderly females of both sexes,
which wrestles with the “social evil” and keeps its
inflamed eye constantly to the keyhole, so to
speak. At a recent meeting this body decided to
“ get the opinion of a local gentleman who inter-
ested himself in such matters on the question:
‘ls unchastity in itself not a crime calling for
legal punishment ?’ ” The Bulletin wouldn’t be
that local gentleman and have a reputation for
“interesting itself in such matters ” for a good
deal. At the same time, it would remark that it
is acquainted with a certain financier, with along,
red beard, who is now understood to be floating
mines somewhere or other, and who knows more
about such subjects than anyone else in this
country, and if the Rescue Society likes to lay the
matter before him, his opinion would be valuable.
Last time this paper saw the person in question he
was hastily leaving a restaurant, chiefly, it
believes, on account of the interest he took in such
matters, and the information he could supply
would make the society’s back iiair stand on end.

EXTERIOR VIEW.
Decorative display is becoming a prominent
feature among the better class of Sydney business
establishments. Such an exclusive attraction has
lately developed under the three months’ able
architectural supervision of Messrs. Mansfield
and Son right in the very heart of busiest Sydney
—at 424 Goorge-street, adjoining the Royal Hotel.
The accompanying illustrations give interior and
exterior views.
# # *
This shop is the largest of its class in the
Southern Hemisphere, and its harmonious interior
decorations and artistic coloring altogether dis-
tinguish it from any shop of its own size in Aus-
tralia. In its early days it was the head office of
Cobb and Co.’s coaches, and the men of the past
generation who started from here with dreams of
gold would fancy they were in one of the chambers
of Aladdin’s palace could they see the electric-
light flashing over this goodly model of shop-
decorative art.
w • •
The electric-light is not more glorious than the
Western star or the Eastern star, but it has
superior polished fittings and an advantageous
variety of beautiful colors. It is, too, simple in
construction and obviously more useful. Besides,
it has the advantage that it can be turned out at
will by gently pressing a button —a consummation
which it is devoutly wished may yet come for the
over-assertive star of the political firmament,
• * *
Compared with the shop electric-light ofte ;
seen, it is a Boon. It does not hang by a string
from a hole knocked in the ceiling, and, therefore,
no customer need dread the glass falling and
striking off his oar or nose or cutting out his eye.
Nor does it glare satire upon dingy walls and fly-
specked ceiling. But here at night it enhances
the effect of already singular effect, and decorate!
already present decoration.
# * *
For half-a-oentury a great proportion of the
Sydney and N.S.W. male population has gone to
Fame or Fortune with the name of Priddy above
its brain-pan. Only one man during that period
has objected to the wearing of the name. He said ;
“ The name of no man shall I wear above my
head ; purge thou thy name from this hat; let the
inside lining thereof be of linen white and spot-
less.” This man came to Australia for the express
purpose of passing round the hat, and naturally,
therefore, he would not give a hatter a free adver-
tisement.
# * *
It is a sphinx-riddle to know where a man
always get a good head, but at Priddy’s he can
always get a good hat. And as a hat is the
measure of the head, and as the head is the
measure of the man, a good hat cannot be too
forcibly impressed upon the head of this com
munity.
It is the crown that makes the king, and the
hat that makes the man. “ Take everything from
me,” said Beau Brummell, “ but leave me my beat
„.,.. „ . ~
hat.” The naked Maori having put on a bell-
, , , , .. , , ... ' lf „
topper and handsome tie he felt himself constitu-
. j . n t n *. tt “a >•
ted to call at Govt. House. A man, said
~, j c i ■ i i
Thackeray, if he wears a new and fashionable
. . . , , , ,i i • „. Q
hat, may spit in the street and not lose his caste
’ H t n .... t
as a gentleman. but the same man spitting from
, , ■ ~, „„„ _j ..
under a shabby hat is done ; he is a blackguard.
# # #
Let the head be shaped like an Apollo’s, like a
pear, pumpkin, sugarloaf, or marrow ; let it be a
reversion to a former type, or unlike anything on
the earth, in the sky above, or in the waters
beneath, Priddy can perfectly adorn this crest
after measuring it with the hat conformator.
# # #
This is a French machine for ascertaining the
exact shape of the head, and once the conforma-
tion of the specimen is thus differentiated, manu-
factoring a hat to hide it means both business and
pleasure. The modest Turk can have his turban
or fez, and the globetrotter, who six weeks before
dandled his Johnny stick along the sweet shady
side of Pall Mall, can hide his jovelike brow under
the last nail-ka-ag from Bond-st. fashion-shops.
# * #
Priddy has a London agent whose daily duty it
is to mark and seize tiie best and latest hats that
grace Hyde Park. The hat-eye of this agent is
t to be diverted by even the charming bicycle
girl in her bloomers, and thus he keeps the Sydney
establishment most steadfastly up-to-date.
, K nc ,i MM , M
With time, money, and opportunity businesses
’ „„
change. Without these, they change much faster;
B J
witness the ghosts of many demnct estabhsh-
c ,
ments. Priddy s, however, progresses forward
-n • p
and changeth for the better. During the past
r , , , • ~ „
ten years it has done more or less in the mercery
J . ...
line, and now the extension of business resulting
•_ „ .
in annexing the large new premises herein illus-
trated will enable Priddy to be both exclusive
mercer and exclusive hatter. Also he will still
l cee P on l ” s show at 078 Brickfield Hill, am ,if
possible, improve the already excellent stock of
fc hat well-known institution.
... . , • A . „
A cheap thing is a dear thing, and true economy
is getting one’s money s worth. Priddy has never
thought of attempting the vulgar cheap business,
hence his customers, like his stock, are of t le
good or better class. He lias lately made arrange-
ments for the regular importation of high-class
specially manufactured on his own order and
design to suit the conditions of this climate. As
this original move is the outcome of half-a-
century s experience in the Sydney trade, the
customer can rely not only upon getting the
highest-class goods at the lowest reasonable rate,
but can also rest assured that it will not be
Priddy’s fault if the new and special hat does not
make the man who wears it.

SPORTING NOTIONS.
Yio. Legislative gammon re a.bill to prohibit all
bet ting has ended seemingly in an act to suppress betting
in the street. The .existing law provides for raids fob
tobacconists’ shops, and could .shut up>the clubs, if it
felt so disposed. Therefore, this dirty little Act to wipe
out street-bookmakers, who have been illegal practitioners
all the time,.is an insult.to the human understanding.
•’ • » *
A “great” Melb. newspaper states the ease
against small bookmakers with exceeding, .frankness.
They popularise gambling ‘inthe lower strata of the
.community. Their business is-not a. whit more illegal,
dishonest, or sinful than that'of the bigger bookmakers
who exploit higher strata of the community—hut they
are of no value to' the Press'. They don’t organise-subur-
ban race-meetings, or bring any- sort of advts. to a
“great” newspaper - proprietor’s pocket. Therefore,
wipe ’em out in order.that the higher-strata men may do
more business whilst attracting Jess attention than before.
It isn’t a matter of one law for the rich and another for
the poor. The law is always the same, but it works up-
wards .instead of downwards, and stops short before

The people behind Bruin think that staying is
his forte, and it must be remembered that he finished con-
siderably nearer to Devon in the Melbourne than in the
Caulfield Cup race. Bruin’s weak point is, or was, his
heart. In the Newmarket Handicap, Toorak ditto, and
Caulfield Cup the handsome beast appeared to collapse
when fairly tackled. In the Melb. Cup he never came
bang to the front, but was going vigorously at the finish,
not half a length behind Patron’s tail.

figured boldly.

Ikey Mo squeals in his agony! “James Mitohell,

Melb. Argus has desoended'to the old sporting-
rag' practice of publishing Cup dreams, which seduce
feeble-minded punters into the stupidest of all racing
follies. Last week the Arcus announced, with ghastly
seriousness—“ Since the publication in this column, a
few days ago, of particulars of a rather remarkable
dream bearing on the two Cups, backers have been coining
very strongly for the double, Bruin and Auraria. One
member of, the ring received no fewer than 26 applica-
tions(mostly from the country)! ! for this particular com-
bination in the course of a couple of days. All the money
at 1000 to 1 has been snapped up, and many backers are
taking what maybe considered a false price rather than
miss the double.” Then this precious benefactor of Ikey
Mo goes on to mention that “ dreams, it need hardly be
pointed out, are very delusive.” But there is nothing
delusive, to the initiated, in the system of laying these
fool-traps. Ikey Mo himself is a most industrious
dreamer or instigator of alleged dreams. It need hardly
be pointed out that the man who goes to, the trouble of
getting a visionary “ double ” into print has possibly a
financial object to serve, and that one, at least, of the
horses, he mentions may be regarded with particular
suspicion.
The Argus should,, get it.s sub-editor, or town-
canvasser, or night-porter, to dream that he backed the
winning double for 1895 with 15 bookmakers, none of
whom cashed up. The Bulletin, having lately been
assailed with brazen assertions of- Ikey M'o.’s virtue, and
worth, takes this opportunity to warn mankind against
the deplorable error of backing any “ double ”■ with any
bookmaker, outside of about six men who. conduct this
dangerous branch of their business legitimately. Gener-
ally speaking, there is but one investment a punter
laments more bitterly than a losing “ dopble,” and
that is the miraculous "double” which* “wins.”
Victoria to-day contains fully two hundred unpaid pickers
of Paris and Patron for last year’s Cups, and N.S.W. can
produce a few similar wallers. And, since there is no
authenticated instance of a defaulting.double-event layer
having been murdered or severely walloped for his fraud,
Ikey Mo grows more reckless every time. If a pair of
early fancies got .home for the Clips this year, the average
odds against payment of a •“ lucky ” double wo.uld be 30
to 1 or thereabouts. Fifty per 'cent, of the wagers already
written down are ndt worth sixpence in the £ in the event
of a “ win."

Can’t Dodge a Cold.
Colds laugh at an umbrella, tjop ooat,s, or heavy
boots; the chill and dampness of the foggy
weather courses through even the heaviest cloth-
ing. There is not a man, woqjan, or child in
Australia but what occasionally has a cold. You
do not always know how you get it, but everyone
knows that severe colds are the forerunner of half
thehuman ailments. 7 The feet getcold, the head hot,
circulation becomes unequal, rthe kidneys become
Irritated,-the liver torpid, the bronchial tubes in-
flamed, or the-excess of uric acid in it he blood is
arrested-and the accumulation causes acute rheu-
matic pains.
Read on.
The first shiver, or sneeze, or chilly sensation
you feel, procure a bottle of Warner’s Safe‘Cure,
the timely use of which will save you from these
menacing developments resulting from a cold. It
quickens the circulation, and the kidneys cannot
become inactive under its use. It enlivens the
liver, and' the bile cannot accumulate in excess.
It kills the-germs of'the cold, and acts promptly
in allaying inflammation. Mr. F. Cobcroft,
miner, Newcastle, writes: “Having caught a
severe chill while working in the coal-mines in this
neighbourlmod, alarming symptoms developed, v
and I became very ill. The attack ultimately
settled in the kidneys. The urine became of a
colour, depositing a brick-dust sediment.
I suffered excruciating 'pains in the back, and
periodically in the region of the heart. My limbs
at last became quite numbed and almost useless.
Becoming alarmed* I obtained the advice of a
doctor,-who said I had inflammation of tlie kid-
neys. He prescribed medecines, which, however,
did me no good. I was about to call another doc-
tor when a mate of mine urged me to take
Warner’s Safe Cure. Accordingly, I used ten
bottles, and two bottles of Warner’s Safe Pills,
after which Tbecame_, quite fit to follow my work
as of'old, and have .continued’to da so ever since.
My euro'is complete. ”
the restless prad, but secretary Clibborn's assurances
ultimately "prevailed on her to Just put the blue
ribbon, over Bob’s neck and even to pat him slightly.
Then the lady-beat a hasty retreat. Mrs. O’Brien came
up and received.(he ribbop, which she took up to a top
seat in the,grandstand and displayed before an admiring
circle offricnds. She was doubtless'the happiest woman

The A.J.C. Derby time, 2m. 41secs., was fairly
goodf-vbut no winner has yet touched Trident's- record

The Derby-winner, Bob Ray, may now be made
a loot article,for’the V.R.C. .classic event, in which he will
probably run well, but he may .meet. his match in
Auraria, it is worthy of note, too, that luek-has always
been against geldings in that race. During the last 40
years' only one has scored,-and that was when Ensign had
the luck to-beat Carbine by a head.

One peculiar feature .about the Derby was the
running of Mannlicher, a one-time favorite, who w,as at
■7 t 0.2 .the night previous, and 7tol at the post. It was
said that he was backward in condition ; but he made the
pace the whole of the way, and ran a d»ad-heat for
third with To/eador. If his mission was merely to make
the pace he executed his task admirably.
♦ * * •
In appearance Bob Ray suffers when compared
with such fine-looking youngsters as Mannlicher, Torea-
dor, and Form, but he smothered them when it came to
racing home in the Derby. It was apparent that he was
the most forward of the field. Condition won the race.
O’Brien paid only 85gs. for the Welcome Jack youngster.

Even with a stone penalty for his Epsom win,
Hopscotch is reckoned to have a respectable show in
Caulfield Cup, in which his weight is now Bst. 101 b. What
his chamce would have been with his original impost of

The Chipping Norton stable scored three wins
on opening day wiih Hopscotch, the Epsom miler ;
Witchery, the Kensington winner, and Quiver, who
downed a good crowd at w.f.a. Treuton’sdaughter made
all her own running in thy latter event, and didn’t come
back to her field'as the other riders anticipated. Patron,
who finished a long way last, should not have been
started. Valiant'ran a rather green finish, but beat the
handsome Delaware for second. St. Hippo, the M.L,
champion, raced behind Quiver the whole way until the
bend. When fined down this horse promises to prove
troublesomeabout Melb. Cup time in w.f.a events.

As the old cpuntry “never was so hard up for
jumping cal tie,”’the wealthy Miller brothers might well
trump the Gibsons’ and Gollan’s lead and send the cham-
pion, Redleap, to England. He is no use in Australia

For 15 years no mare won Melb. Cup, until
that beauty, Briseis, waltzed home with the double in ’76.

The system of letting horses out for an “airing,”
which would bring a Duke of ‘Westminster into bad
odour, is actually commended by the sporting press.
A newspaper nmralist wrote of- a certain horse’s appear-
ance for a race*, the other Saturday, “the cognoscenti
agreed that was only having the perfectly justifi-
able ‘sweat'in public,’one of, in my opinion, the wisest
courses-trainenj<oan pursue, as one race is worth half-a-
dozen private gallops to put condition on-a horse.” This
is utter nonsense, anyway, and pestilential rot from a
sportsman’s point of view. Observe how the theory
adapts itself to the wiles of admittedly “ oronk ” owners.
Who shall decide as to whether a horse had enough
“ condition on him ” when he wasn’t a goer? If he runs
as stiff as the proverbial crutch—well, the noble animal
was having a “ necessary sweat in public,” and his unex-
pected victory in the next race he starts for is the result
of the “ wise course" his jockey pursued a day or two
before.

In the English season’s batting averages,
Qwynn, of Dublin'University, is first with 56, M’Laren
second with 'sl‘2, and Grace third with 51. Gwynn’s
average is.on a small numb.er of innings, and practically
Grace again heads the English batsmen. During the past
-32 years, Grace’s biggest average was,in '7l, with 78‘2,
'his lowest in ’9l, with 197. From ’6B to ’74 his lowest
average was 53'4 ; his highest, 78‘2. This present average
of 51-is his first oyer 50 since ’B7, when he reached 54 •&,
and the s.econd'over sCLsince ’76, when he put up C2‘4 per
innings. He,began in ’64 with an average of 57 - 4, and
shis yearly average in first-class cricket on the total
innings played in ’64, and, the e'iisuing 30 years, comes to
40'7. This year, therefore, Grace has beaten his yearly
average, compiled oirifSl years’ basis, by 10'3 runs.
* » -* *
The crushing defeat inflicted by Stoddart’s
team upon an All-England eleven, captained by Grace,
brings balm to Australian wounds. In the first innings
the'soores were remarkably team 217,
and All-England 220. In the second, after six of Stod-
dart’s team had fallen for 120, ForJaiid Lockwood put on
169 without losing their wickets, Stoddart declaring the
innings closed with 289 f for 6 wickets. All-England then
fell for 68 in two hoursfoefore Richardson and Peel. The
collapse of a whole team so suddenly after the masterly
display of Ford and Lock-wood argues that the wicket was
just sufficiently worn to suit Richardson’s deliveries. A
fast right-hand bowler and a heady medium left-hander
like Peel are an awkward combination if the wicket
" does anything ; ” nevertheless, according to cable,
Riohattdson’is paralysers were the chief factor. Richard-
son is fourth in this season’s English bowling averages,
and Peel si^th.

That opinion of Riobardson’a about the English
elevens beating the next Australian team fairly easily,
will doubtless be verified if, as usual, the English authori-
ties fix the All England v. Australia dates-so late ini the
season that the Australians are stale. Certainly the
English cricketers play hard- through a hard season, but
they are in their own homes, or ought to he, and, there-
fore, they do not come in for travelling hardships, which
are hardships when they are the only rest a man gets
after working at cricket-playing. One team of Aus-
tralian cricketers went in the legs towards the season’s
close, and the ironical English papers would exclaim, in
loudest type, when the Australians did win a match,
“ The Australians have suffered a victory at last.”

Will the N.S.W. public find funds, to repair the
monument to sculler Searle ? It they, do, ’twill be,almost
wonderful. The lack of general enthusiasm regarding the
memories of those who have been dead over 48 hours is a
ghastly satire on the mcinument-craze in general. To-day
your friends plant your crave with roses ; next week they
won’t trouble to shoo the goats oil.

Fitzsimmons’s first notable appearance in the
ring dates from the visit of Abe Hicken’s travelling
athletic 00. to Timaru, M.L., a few years ago. On open-

tion among the local lads. Fitz., being then under
that limit, entered, and, despite his clumsy form, his
long reach and wiry frame managed to soor.e. This win
encouraged him to follow up boxing, and he practised
assiduously, but at first apparently without much im-
provement, judging by the sorry display he gave on his
Sydney d6hut.

Victoria is the proud possessor of one teetotal
bowling-green. When Jimmy Munro made Armidale
Club the present of its site, he attached a condition in
the deed of gift that no liquor.should be sold there. Yet
it has plenty of members, and Armidale Club holds the
premier pennant. But there is a hotel near by ; also,
there are loud grumbles about members having so far to
walk ; likewise, most of the Armidale Club’smatcheS are
played on other (non-teetotal) grounds.

A novel point in tennis. A strong wind is on.
A, playing against the Wind, returns the ball very high.
It lands in B’s court near the net, but the wind blows' it,
after the bounce, on to A’s side of the net. B runs round
the post, and meeting the ball before its second time of
touching ground, plays it into A’s court successfully.
The rule says “players must stand on opposite sides of
the net,” so, technically, B loses the stroke. But it is
plain that morally B should count the stroke, because the
high wind is what lawyers and ship-men call “ the act of
God,” and, therefore, a matter beyond the responsibility
of the defendant.

A 0. of E. bazaar was held somewhere in Aus-
tralia, a few weeks back, and with the idea of drawing
the cash from the army of local barrackers the name of
“Tracker” M'Dougail, a football god, was placed on the
list of patrons. At the opening ceremony, the genial
Tracker turned up in his best suit and stood beside the
secretary, basking in the admiring glances of the
assemblage. Suddenly the sec. felt a tug at his arm.
“ Who’s that old chap ? ” asked the Unparalleled follower.
“Why that’s the bishop” (he’s a very ugly bishop, by
the way), was the reply. “ Him the bishop! If yer gave
him a nut he’d scratch himself.” So much for footballers
as assistants at religious bazaars. And, on consideration,
so much for bishops.

The Vie. authorities sent a double force of
police, with an official shorthand-writer, down to
Yarra Bank Sunday meeting, where J. A.
Andrews made his first public appearance in Mel-
bourne after a five years’ absence in N.S.W. He
told them he was imprisoned in Sydney for,
amongst other things, bringing the police-force
and the administration of justice into contempt.
“Now, I couldn't do that," he remarked by way
of parenthesis—and the crowd smiled audibly.
Two more Victorian attorneys suspended
last week, making seven in all. “We are Seven.’

’Twould be “Shocking Neglect of a Serving-man,”

It’s “ Gallant Escape of a Servian Prince ”•
And “Wonderful Presence of Mind.”
The prospectus of a new Sydney daily, the
Australian Times, is published, capital .£lOO,OOO
in 20,000 £5 shares. It has a wealthy directorate,
and if the editorial part of the business possesses
as much brains as are accumulated on the board
it should do well. So far as can be gathered from
the prospectus, the Times is intended to be the
organ of pure National Ass principles, or else it
intends to sit eloquently on a rail. Anyhow, it
states as distinctly as possible that it intends to
maintain a rousing fight with the morning papers
already existing, and The Bulletin wishes it
success on the general ground that a fight is an
exhilarating thing at all times and good for the
soul.
Someone sends along a picturesque horror
from the Queensland backblocks. The scene was
a bush pub., where a shearer had been swamping
his cheque in rum, and having the jim-jams in the
stable “ between whiles.’’ Finally, he got posses-
sion of a gun and blew most of his head off on the
doorstep, and his remains were laid out in a shed
to await burial. Then a great inspiration came
upon the frowsy houri of the bar. She had a
lover who resided in the house, and who had
recently shown signs of falling away from his
allegiance and offering his soiled hand to a
younger divinity. And the barmaid, who had
long been craving for an overwhelming ven-
geance, now saw a way to get square with
her horny deceiver. That night the young man
came in late with the sidelong air of a dog which
has been stealing a chop, and she asked him if he
would have a nice slice of pork for supper. He
was surprised at her urbanity, but accepted the
offer. Then she took the carving-knife, and
sneaked out to the shed where the deceased was
lying on a stretcher A portion of
the story is here left to the imagina-
tion. An hour later the young man re-
marked, as he finished up with a glass of
beer, that it “ was the tenderest bit of blanky
pork he ever tasted.” And next day a bewildered
jury brought in a verdict that the deceased had
evidently cut three slices off himself with a knife
and concealed them in some place unknown, and
that he had then committed suicide by shooting
himself with a gun. Also, the coroner and the
local chemist agreed that the case was most extra-
ordinary.

Here Rassmussen. March 15th, 1894.
Sir —I hereby beg to certify that having been a sufferer from
General Debility of the Nervous System for over seven years, and
having tried without success several of the leading both in
Sydney and Melbourne, I was advised to try your Alfaline Remedies.
I'am thankful I did so, for after a few courses of the Alfaline Remedies
I am now completely cured, and I shall be most happy to recommend
your remedies to anyone suffering as 1 was. Thanking you for your
courtesy and the uniform patience with which you have treated me,
allow me to say that you can make what use you may think proper of
this.

A Wonderful Cure.
Herr Rassmussen. August, 1894.
Dear Sir,—ln the year of 18711 was eight days in the water sheep-
washing, and contracted rheumatism and stiffness in the joints, and
have tried all advertised medicines. When I came to Sydney I had n
great difficulty in walking, and went to the Turkish baths, which did
no good. Passing your window I saw a testimonial from Mr. E. W.
O’Sullivan, M.P., with the same complaint as I had, which led me to
try vonr Remedies. On Thursday before Good Friday I took the first
of your Pills; since then I have used 4 boxes Special Powerful Alfaline
Vitality Pills, 3 boxes Special Powerful Alfaline Rheumatic Pills, with
Liver and Kidney Pills, and free use of your Alfaline Eucalyptus Oil,
and lam now, with the blessing of God, as well in health as I was 23
years ago. I can with great confidence recommend your Remedies to
anyone suffering from the same complaint. May you long be spared
under God to be a blessing to suffering humanity.
I remain, dear sir, yours very gratefully, JOHN KEAY.

We hereby certify that we sold on account of Mr. John Orozier the St. Alban’s Estate to Mr.
W. R. Wilson on March 30, 1890, for the sum of cash. At this time the property was very
lightly stocked. We have examined Mr. Wilson’s books, and certify further that blood stock to the
value (actual cost) of £32,041 has since been added to those originally purchased. Eurther, that the
sales of St. Alban’s Yearlings conducted by us during the seasons 1890-1-2-3 and 1894 realised a
total of 33,841 guineas, or an average of 210 guineas each.

1. —THE ST. ALBAN’S ESTATE, con
sisting of 842 acres, situated 3£ miles east of
Geelong, Victoria, Australia. The property is
divided irito,3o paddocks, many with live hedge
fences. _ „
As a Breeding and Racing Establishment it is
questionable if any more complete place exists in
Europe: certainly it has no rival in Australia.
Originally selected and laid out by Mr. James
Wilson, one of the keenest judges in the colonies,
money has continued to bo freely expended on
improving and perfecting it by Mr. W. R.
Wilson, its present owner, so that it is now one
of the show places of Victoria.
The land is extremely fertile and sound, nearly
all the paddocks being laid down in English
grasses. The Barwon River (2 chains wide and
20ft. deep) intersects the property, thus ensuring
a never-failing supply of fresh water, alike for use
and irrigation. The system for the latter^is per-
fect, the drains being most extensive, and the
steam-pumping plant has a capacity of 120,000
gallons per hour. The rainfall is, however, so
good that it is rarely necessary to irrigate more
than two or three paddocks during a summer.
The plantations and hedges, of which several
miles exist, add to the usefulness and beauty of
the estate in a marked degree.
Shelter Sheds of large capacity are placed in
many of the paddocks, while the Yearling
Quarters consist of 40 loose boxes, cool and well
ventilated, built in quadrangular form, and of
ample size. Stone and brick tanks, windmills,
and feed-bins are placed in convenient places in
fie various paddocks, and the yards, &c., are
ample and perfectly arranged.
In the centre of the Estate the Training Track
and Course proper are laid out (14 miles and 1
mile 5 furlongs round respectively). Both may
well be compared to Flemiugton or Randwick,
the going being good in all weathers.
The Scraping Sheds are moat suitably placed,
and an Elevated Stand commands a most perfect
view of the tracks, river, and estate generally,
with the far-famed Barrabool Hills in the dis-
tance.
The Stallion Boxes are lofty and well-designed,
opening into a large covered-in exercise ground.
Feed rooms, men’s rooms, &c., are under the
i one roof. The Training Stables are perfect, and
contain 15 loose boxes, feed rooms, men’s rooms,
and every necessary adjunct to a first-class estab-
ment. Two cottages for stable boys are in close
proximity, and the out-buildings are extensive
and ample.
THE HOUSE —Brick and of modern design,
jonsists of about 30 rooms, and is a perfectly
appointed gentleman’s residence, beautifully situa-
ted, having a superb view of the You Yang
Ranges and Corio Bay, the latter only two miles
distant.

WHEN “ BRUMMY” RINGS THE BELL.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I’m toiling for a living out-back in New South
Wales
(Good luck I’ve got the muscle that serves when
all else fails), , ■
And as the sun moves slowly west I oft wish for
the “ spell ”
And “smoke ” that follows tucker-time when
Brummy rings the bell.
When Brummy rings the bell, that crack’d old
bullock-bell,
Whose rattling, jangling, tin-pot tone the
“ hands ” all know so well,
Ah ! welcome is the sound to us, for everyone can
tell
It’s time for “scoff”—all hands knock off when
Brummy rings the bell.
We’re bathed in perspiration, the dust cakes
in our eyes,
While round our heads with ceaseless buzz are
circling swarms of flies ;
The air seems like a furnace-blast, it’s just as hot
as hell,
Till sundown ends the day at last, and Brummy
rings the bell.
When Brummy rings the bell, a crack’d old
bullock-bell,
Which every station cook has got, though why
I cannot tell,
We know another day’s “got in,” and hurry off
pell-mell,
With visions of a good square “scoff,” when
Brummy rings the bell.
I fancy when my cheque’s made up I’ll try my
luck round west,
Instead of down to Sydney town to “ blue it ” like
the rest —
And if success attend me I’ll return a howling
swell,
And give all hands a fair blow-out when
Brummy rings the bell.
When Brummy rings the bell, that crack’d old
bullock-bell,
Which every station-hut can boast, to tucker-time
foretell—
Well, if you visit Booberai and ask for me
they’ll tell
How “Ted, the Scoffer,” waltzes in when
Brummy rings the bell.
F.W.S.
AFTER THE SPREE.
A Ballad of Australia.)
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
If you’ve got to travel gratis when you’ve had a
month in town,
Hark to the mutton-track callin’!
You’d best not tarry longer when you’ve changed
the last half-crown,
But hark to the mutton-track callin’ 1
So roll up your fly and your blanket,
Your quart-pot, tommyhawk, and tea;
Have another drink, and when you’ve drank
it,
Take your bloomin’ hat off to your spree !
If you want to hear the thunder of the stampers
where it’s rich,
Hark to the gold-fields callin’!
To sit between the shifts and hear the yarns the
diggers pitch,
Hark to the gold-fields callin’!
But if you make a note and never bank it,
You can reckon that it’s all u.p.
So have another drink, and when you’ve
drank it,
Take your bloomin’ hat off to your spree 1
Do you say that you are frightened of the dusty,
hot-wind trail?
Hark to the locusts callin’ !
That there’ll be a swaggy missin’ should the
water-bottle fail ?
Hark to the locusts callin’!
There’s many curse their luck that ought to
thank it,
And there’s good fish yet in the sea !
So have another drink, and when you’ve
drank it,
Take your bloomin’ hat off to your spree !
If you’ve got to travel gratis there’s some roads
that might be worse :
Hark to the blue-gums callin’!
The mutton-track’s the bullivard where you don’t
require a purse!
Hark to the blue-gums callin’!
So roll up your fly and your blanket,
Your quart-pot, tommyhawk, and tea;
Have another drink, and when you’ve drank it,
Take your bloomin’ hat off to your spree !

“Rich the treasure , sweet the pleasure - sweetest pleasure after painl %
Dryden (Homocea Measure.)
đ
“IT TOUCHES THE SPOT.”-Aye, that is what ‘Homocea’
does. And does it quickly too—whether it’s a toothache or
neuralgia, with all their shooting pains, or eczema, with its
painful and distressing irritation. Rheumatism in the joints or
muscles has been cured, even of years’ standing—while for
cuts, bums, and bruises it is far ahead of any ointment that has ever been
before the public.
LORD GARRICK
says * Homocea ’
cured him of He-
morrhoids, when
d
all else failed ; that he gave some to a labourer who was rendered quite lame
ď
by a stone falling upon him, and it cured him in four
days. A woman had a pain in the elbow and could
not bend it for a year, and it cured her, and another
used it for a bad leg, and it was doing her good.
One letter closes from him with the words, “It is the
most wonderful stuff 1 ever came across.”
LORD COMBERMERE says that he
found “ Homocea did him more good
than any other embrocation he had ever
used for rheumatism.
đ
Remember that “ Homocea” subdues inflammation and allays irritation almost as soon as applied.
All Storekeepers and Chemists stock “ Homocea.”

Mrs, M‘Cooley, of the Gluepot -
Swamp Receiving Office,
[ FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“ Here, just you go and nail that hole up at once 1
Nice thing to have the post-office and not know
who posts the letters. Actually fixed up with
wax, too I I wonder who they think is going to
interfere with their letters ? It came from
Orowson’s, up the creek. I’ll bet, but it ain’t his
writing. He must write some nice letters—
actually told his children that they hadn’t got to
answer me if 1 asked them about the letters. No
use asking if you know the writing; you don’t
take no interest in nothing, you don’t.
“ It’s to old Chumlig, the storekeeper at Gallego.
Mrs. Ross told me, the last time she came for her
mail, that Crowson owed Chumlig a lot of money ;
hadn’t paid him all the time he was living at One
Gully. I wonder where he got the wax from ?
It’s reg’lar insulting to seal a letter like this when
it has only to go through my office and Gallego ;
looks as though he suspected a person."
“ Well, I declare, if Crowson didn’t get off all;
old Chumlig’s doings. Leaner, the other J.P.,
was against him at first; but old Chumlig kept on
questioning and bothering the witnesses till he got
them fair mixed up, and he seemed to sort of twist
little Leaner round. It was a regular shame.
Crowson orter got three years, at least. But I
suppose Chumlig knew he couldn’t get his money
if Crowson was in gaol. I always think that letter
had something to do with it. If it hadn’t been for
that wax—or even if you’d let the Post Office
alone, and minded your own business, I could have
got it all out of young Crowson when he posted
the letter.
“ A woman don’t get no chance with the likes
of you about. The only thing I’d be bothe ed
with the office for is to see that everything goes
on fair and square, and there you go and spoil my
best chance. Serve you right to get some of your
own sheep stolen.”
BAKBLOX.
Dear Bulletin, —Re Larry Petrie (an old
friend of mine) and the Australian Workers’
Union. “Edward Agamiau,” who writes you
from ’Frisco, is much astray. The Conferences of
the A.S.U. and G.L.U. delegates, held in Sydney
in ’92 (not ’93), at which Petrie was not present,
resolved to submit a scheme of amalgamation of
the above bodies to a plebiscite vote of their joint
membership—if carried, the name “Australian
Workers’ Union ” to be adopted by the amal-
gamated body. This vote was taken in ’92 and
defeated. In ’93 it was again put to members
and carried in N.S.W. and S.A. branches, but
defeated in Victoria. In ’94 the objecting
branches agreed to come into line, and the whole
organisation finally assumed the new name at the
Albury Convention of the present year. The
major portion of the scheme emanated from the
brain of “Billy Lane,” a Queensland delegate,
but, strange to say, the Northern province has
not yet fully thrown in its lot, although cordially
co-operating, with its Southern brethren. —Yours,
&c., Arthur Rae (President A. W.U.), Sydney,
Ist August, ’95. P.S.—The Queensland Shearers’
and Laborers’ Unions amalgamated in their own
province under the name of the “ Amalgamated ”
Workers’ Union over two years ago. As
paragraphs such as Agamiau’s help to “ make
history,” it is as well they make it correctly.
Hence this note. —A.R.
The Sick Cahriden
[ FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Just shake my pillows up a bit, and take the
rocking-chair,
The cough’s not half so bad to-day, so I’m feeling
pretty fair;
Not as I used to feel, of course, in the days of old
lang syne,
When we didn’t “cab-it” home until the sun
began to shine.
What nights we had together, Bert! the hours
were ten till four
A.m,, deah boy, a.m., by Jove; and sometimes
rather more.
We burnt the candle then both ends, and never
snuff’t the wicks;
We started off with squashes straight, but soon
began to mix.
Open the window wide—that’s right—the room
gets rather warm.
Ah! Bert, if I were well again, back in my
summer form,
I’d play you billiards, fifty-up, and think it fun to
lose,
Or take a turn down Oollins-street in patent-
leather shoes,
I dressed myself last Sunday week, that’s bound
to make you smile,
The pants hung loose and—well, the coat was not
the latest style;
’Twas nine months since I’d had it home, the
collar seemed so strange.
Cut differently to yours. Heigho 1 how soon the
fashions change 1
What was I saying, though ? Ah, yet, the nights
we had, my word !
To be in bed at sunrise, Bert, is awfully
absurd ;
When the light comes stealing in my room, I’m
often wide awake,
And I sigh to be about again, for pretty Flossie’s
sake.
She misses me, I bet she does; you know what
women are;
She liked me best of all the boys who patronised
her bar;
Although we kept the house up late she didn’t
once complain,
Except that night when Phil got “tight” and
wouldn’t shout champagne.
Poor Floss ! I used to send her flowers, the
choicest things in bloom,
You never saw her wear ’em —true, she put them
in her room.
Syd. Saunders had a notion that she gave them
all away,
But I’m sure she always kept ’em, for she told me
so one day.
She didn’t mind my teasing her, I never made
her mad—
What hair! my word! what splendid teeth, and
what a bust she had !
She would have let me kiss her once, I think —in
fact, no doubt —
If she hadn’t been so frightened that the “boss”
might be about.
We sowed some wild oats, rather —yes, by Jove 1
we sowed a crop,
Do you reoolleot those darlings at the tea-and-
coffee shop ?
Nice girls; the little fair one, not the youngest
(she was dark),
Pinched my arm last time I saw her, on the
vacoination-mark.
Have a cigarette, old fellow, in that box you’ll
find a few—
And tell me, how’s the chorus ? Have you spotted
something new,
Or is your heart still constant to the one you
mashed that night
From the stage-box ? You remember, she was
dressed in blue and white.
You love her still —you terror ? and she’s smiling
just the same ;
You ought to try to meet her, Bert, and find out
what’s her name.
My mash, you know, was Maud de Yaux, she
mostly played the page.
It’s hard to have to die before I’ve seen her off the
stage.
But I mustn’t make you gloomy, with this talk
about the past—
They were awf’ly jolly times, and I was awf’ly
jolly fast.
I must contemplate the present, here we are in
“ budding spring,”
And I don’t think my pyjamas are at all the
proper thing.
They are beastly winter patterns, and the buttons,
too, are brutes;
As a favor, deah old fellow, choose me half-a-
dozen suits ;
Let the stripes be bright and lively, but not, of
course, too wide—
And I think I’d like the jackets with a pocket
either side.
They’ll last me out : yes, Bertie, they’ll last me
out, I know ;
What’s the odds ! I’m only going where all other
johnnies go.
I’ve been reading Gordon’s poems—wish the book
was better bound—
And they’ve set me almost longing to be under-
neath the ground.
I took my whack of pleasure, and I sometimes
felt a pain :
Perhaps I’d knock off smoking if I had to live
again,
But I’ve no regrets to speak of ; there’s a heavy
tailor’s bill,
And that my aunt will settle when I’m lying cold
and still.
Suppose you must be toddling, if you promised
Kate you’d call —
A doosid fetching filly, though her eyes are rather
small;
I’d like to stroll down with you for an hour, one
afternoon :
I would lean across the counter, and, by Jingo !
how I’d spoon.
Good-bye, you mustn’t mind my tears —good-bye,
so glad you came;
Remember me to all the girls I used to know by
name,
And raise your hat to Flossie, whom I nevermore
may see —
Yes, raise your hat to pretty Floss, and kiss your
hand— -for me.
Melb.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
After all, there are few fatal accident?
among whalers. The calling being lull of danger,
every precaution Is taken, and nothing loft to
chance. Still, there are many “ close shaves.”
« • •
There was little wind. The whaling
barque Derwent, of Hobart, rolled languidly as
she lazily cruised under easy sail. Presently a
cry came from the look-out man aloft—“ Whales
right ahead 1 ” delivered as only whalers can deliver
it. There was a rush for the boats, each man knowing
his place and what was expected of him. Down
dropped the boats and hurriedly they pushed clear
of the ship. “Bend your backs, but break no
oars,” is the “ spouter’s ” creed, and strong arms
made the frail craft fairly fly from the strokes of
the long, light blades. Five men in each boat
pulling their hardest —racing for their prey. The
mate in charge of the leading boat chose his fish ;
the other boats singled theirs.
The mate’s quarry “sounded.” The experi-
enced helmsman calculated on the spot where the
fish would rise again. A short interval, and the dark
body re-appears on the surface, making a swirl of
the waters as it emerges from the depths. Away
goes the boat till within “range.” The bow-man
relinquishes his oar and stands ready, weapon in
hand. “Give it to him!” —the iron hurtles
through the air and fastens. “ Stern all I” The
rowers back water. The line sings as the whale
starts forward. The logger-head smokes as the
boats tears through the water, level with the gun-
wales yet none coming in, so furious is the pace.
Oh, the excitement of it!
• * •
It happened in an instant—no one could
say precisely how. The mate had become en-
tangled in the line, was plucked out of the boat
ere he could utter a cry, and was following in the
wake of the mad monster ahead while the tem-
porarily-dazed crew looked on in blank dismay.
• • •
But they were not all paralysed. The
quick, sinewy darkey, active in the water as a fish
itself, hesitated not a moment. Sheath-knife in
mouth, he clutched the line, and, rapidly hauling
himself along it, hand over hand, disappeared
from view. How time seemed to hang ! though
the whole business could have been summed up in
seconds.
Watching and waiting anxiously, hopelessly,
whilst the motor still dragged them along, those
in the boat felt the line suddenly slacken—then
hang loosely over the bows. Their velocity was
checked, though the boat still ran on with the im-
petus gained.
A second or two later two figures floated on the
surface, one supported by the other. They were
soon picked up—the mate senseless, his dark
deliverer well-nigh exhausted —and no time was
lost in getting back to the ship.
* » •
The negro had grasped the situation at a
glance. The mate was foul of the line, which had
a complete turn round his leg; he could never
have cleared himself. He owed his life to the
black man’s ready steel.

[ FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Princess glanced at me shyly, with
velvety black eyes.
“ I cannot stay, I must go back now,” she said
in broken English and soft, liquid accents.
Then she looked down modestly.
The adjective would seem inappropriate to
people who associate modesty less with glance
than with garment. Of the latter the Princess
had as little as can be discreetly mentioned,
almost as little as Mother Eve before the Fall.
At first sight she shocked my civilised suscepti-
bilities with her beautiful brown bust, bare to the
sun, and the well-defined line of hip under the
thin, tight covering.
1 naturally agreed with the missionaries and
other devout and delicate-minded people that she
was a bold, bad miss who had to be taught
modesty.
Then I fell to considering the beautiful dark
face above the bust, and a new reading dawned
upon me.
1 remembered that Eve, in her days of inno-
cence, “was not ashamed.”
# » *
The Princess was not ashamed.
She moved like an animated bronze statue. The
curve of her hips undulated gracefully as she
swung over the ground with firm, untrammelled
ease. The poise of her head was artistic as she
raised the bundle of washing she did not disdain
to carry. But of none of these was she conscious.
If she moved with an air of statuesque pride it
was from the innate consciousness of her dignity
as a Princess, a maid in whose veins flowed pure,
untainted blood, a Taupo maid to boot, the set-
apart virgin of the village, with whom none dared
to meddle, and whom it behoved to walk about
guarded and attended.
# # *
But she was dimly conscious that my ways
were not as her ways, and with puzzled courtesy
she tried to consider my feelings. When I drew
near she donned a loose, decollete bodice, or a
dark scarf wound round her neck and falling over
her bosom. They belonged to her full dress ward-
robe, and she was quite willing to wear them as a
concession to my civilised weakness.
I felt the courtesy and the concession. I also
felt humiliated thereby. The humiliation was
good for my soul.
I had been preparing a monograph for the Vir-
tuous Literature Society on “ The Influence of
Civilisation in the Development of Modesty and
Decency,” and I had come to reside among non-
virtuous savages for purely literary ends.
I thought I would allow that monograph to
stand over for the present. It struck me that I
had fallen into linguistic error, and confounded
Drapery with Decency.
# # #
My Princess has other ideas.
To her drapery is a question of dress in the
sense of adornment; but decency has no part
therein.
It is also a question of class, not sex, distinction.
It is finally a question of satisfying innate
artistic instincts, unspoilt as yet by thirst for ad-
miration. .
In short, my Princess has her own ethics of
dress, but they are not to be found in the fashion-
books.
When she winds a fresh lava lava round her
beautiful limbs, she chooses it of a bright tartan
pattern to contrast with her brown skin, or a rich
blue to blend therewith; but so also do her father
and brother. When she passes a fragrant white
frangipanni, a scarlet hibiscus, or a yellow fau
blossom, she gathers and places it in the fluffy
black locks which she has dexterously pinned up,
prompted by the same love of coloring that brings
her brother leaping from the bush with a necklace
of scarlet berries and a wreath or kirtle of green
leaves.
But she no more looks in the mirror than
yonder orange-red, black-winged bird, twittering
in the breadfruit-tree, looks in the stream. The
only mirrors she recks of are certain minute ones
which will be piled high on her enormous wig
when she is suitably attired to dance at the com-
ing Siva.
For she is the Village Virgin, queen of festivi-
ties by right of birth, beauty and virtue, and this
it is which makes her at once so pure and so proud
in her savage innocence.
* * *
In that other world, the world of civilisa-
tion from which I come, we do not as a general
thing credit the belle of the season with a retir-
ing disposition.
Neither do we necessarily associate high kicking
and serpentine dancing with modesty and deport-
ment.
My princess is high-kicker, serpentine-dancer,
and society belle, in the native acceptation of the
terms. But her ideas strike me as terribly incon-
sistent with her position.
For instance, when in full-dress she covers up
more of her person than when in ordinary plain—
particularly plain—costume.
Also, when at home among her own people, she
walks about in serene unconsciousness of her Eve-
like appearance; but if she sees it attracting the
roving eye of a cranky foreigner, like myself, she
seeks a slight covering which shall conceal her
outlines.
The society belle of my acquaintance proceeds
in an opposite direction; the more strangers she
expects to meet the more decollete she is. As for
the high-kicker ....
I privately fancy the Princess would take ex-
ception to the general appearance of the high-
kicker.
* * *
For, as I remarked before, she has her
own dress ethics, dimly perceived by me, but not
analysed.
In proof thereof, she eyes with stern disfavor
my print of Leighton’s “ Psyche Unveiled,”
which hangs on the wall. The young lady is a
great deal too discreet to give it any further
notice than that of a startled glance; but her
attendant duenna was more explicit, and enquired,
with an expression of disgust curling her thick
upper-lip, what had happened to Psyche’s lava-
lava.
Now Duenna was, “inher figure,” a very passee
objectionable figure. But she also had her ethics
as well as her dingy-white lava-lava. I must dis-
tinctly mention that Psyche’s sex has “ nothing to
do with the case.” Cupid, without the inevitable
lava-lava or a leaf kilt, would be just as
scandalous. The question of Decency versus
Drapery becomes daily more complicated.
* * *
On one occasion the Princess had a tiff
with the (Protestant) missionaries. She looks too
placid to have a tiff with anyone, but this was a
serious occasion. It was a question of dress
ethics.
The Princess wanted to go to the mission
school; the missionaries were nothing loth ; but
the matter of attire had to be primarily settled,
and, in matters of attire, Protestant missionaries
are stiff.
They are indifferent as to color, but rigid as to
covering. Their pupils must all be dressed in a
loose gown which they originally introduced, but
which, by some strange mistake, is habitually
styled “ native dress.” The term is preposterous.
N o native would ever have invented anything so
unbecoming to a fully-developed figure ; out of 10
native women who wear it eight look clumsy and
slipshod.
But it suited alike the properties of Christianity
and civilisation— i.e., it hid the human form and
suggested that there was something to conceal.
• * #
The Princess’s artistic instinct and her
pride of place alike rebelled.
Her soul revolted at the shapeless gown, but it
revolted still more at a civilised uniform which
would bring her to the level of the common herd.
She was quite willing to appear always in her
short, loose, sleeveless decollete blouse, or in a
long neck scarf. But to cover herself up to the
throat and down to the wrist and hide her lava
lava/ she, the beautiful Taupo, the Village Virgin,
just as if she had some blemish to conceal —the
notion was preposterous, not to say shocking.
The missionaries were inflexible. The Princess
was likewise inflexible. So she went to the nuns,
and the good sisters did not clothe hex-, but took
her in.
» * »
The nuns, who are the most covered-up
ladies of my acquaintance, seem less prejudiced
on this point than their sister missionaries of the
rival faith. If you except the hands, no artist
can make a possible guess at a nun’s figure, or
even assert with positive certainty that she has a
figure at all. Yet in this part of the world the
sisterhood accept with philosophy native views on
the subject of dress. Possibly their own super-
fluity of raiment in a tropical clime makes them
sympathise with the desire for mother Eve’s free-
dom. Anyhow, though they drew the line at
appearances “in her figure,” they allowed the
Princess to drape that figure as slightly as she
pleased.
Still more remarkable, they seem not to have
given her any civilised reason for draping the
figure. Consequently, she left the convent with
her curious code of ethics unaltered. lam not at
all obliged to the .nuns, for they might have saved
me a great deal of unsatisfactory cogitation,
# # *
Some day my Princess will resign her
position as Virgin of the Village to become the
wife of a great chief.
She will be draped in stiff rich mats so heavily
that she can scarcely walk—not for decency,
but for display ; the clan on each side will
come laden with presents for general distribution;
and feasting, and speech-making, and gift-giving
will run riot.
Then her days of dancing and daintiness and
picturesque attire will be over. She will grow fat
and lazy and degenerate into one of the sloppy,
jolly native women who slouch about the place.
Her artistic perception will dwindle, she will take
to the loose wrapper and to a larrikiness hat im-
ported by the island trader. But her moral tone
will not be thereby altered; she will still, on
washing-day, or at tub-hour, cast aside the gown,
appear in the lava-lava, and be “ not ashamed.”
Or she will perchance marry a white man who
will instil some white notions into her dark head.
She will wear her loose gown with a conscious air,
add stockings and French shoes to her wardrobe,
acquire a notion of the improprieties and the art
of blushing—though I believe the latter is out of
date.
• * •
I had serious thoughts of being that white
man. I had serious thoughts of falling in love
with the Princess. She is quite charming enough.
And then there would be all the romance of
rescuing her from her present semi-barbarous con-
dition and surrounding her with the refinements
of enlightened conventionalism. It was a very
pretty frame for a romance, but one thing dis-
turbed me. I could not sketch in my Princess
satisfactorily as central figure. It was out of the
question to introduce her in her lava-lava , and I
fear her loose bodice or neck-scarf would not find
favor even on the most full-dress night of the
“ circle. ’’ There would be nothing for it but civi-
lised attire, and my heart quailed at the visions
this evoked. I remembered divers fat Jewesses
in gala array who were my pet aversion. Could
I ensure my Princess against proving a
second edition of these 1 And could any
romance hold out against the appearance
of a dark, much spread-out young person, in
the silk and furbelows and buckramed waist of
fashion ?
True, my Princess would learn the art of Drap-
ing—the ethics of Decency. I paused and be-
thought me again of a full-dress night in the circle
and “ living models ” on the stage.
With the art of Draping my Princess might
also acquire the arts of Immodesty. She might
perchance learn to be ashamed.
* * #
I refrained from falling in love.

“ Curse him for the greediest scoundrel in the city,”

“ S’elp me, but I faked ’em expreshly for the Golden

“Yes, and I know a little too much about you, Levi,
don’t I, to admit of tricks,” said Vardon, motioning him
to the door.
The whole horrid truth was laid bare to him in one
sharp, heart-piercing slab.
“ Liar and thief !” exclaimed Guy, exasperated by the
other’s sneering coolness. “ You know well enough what
I mean. Answer me the question, aye or nay, before I
move from this spot.”
