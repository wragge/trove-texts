THE: END OF A STORY
ON Dec. 29 we printed the true story of “A
Modern Lover” —all but the ending—
and asked for an ending in 70 words to
match the ending written and reserved.
It will —or won’t—be remembered that the lover
was the unusual (Australian) kind of person
who ‘"went into a kind of trance,” and the girl
was left at home with “an acute pain that gra-
dually became unbearable.”
What did she do ? Some answers suggested a
rehabilitation of the lover; but that was n’t in the
story .- that kind of lover Gould n’t alter suddenly
and efficaciously.
Some were jocular:
With a supreme effort, she flung herself from the bed
at 3 a.m., and picked up The Bulletin , price sixpence.
The National Australian Newspaper. Australia for the
Australians. Her eyes brightened. She dashed into the
street and rang a bell. Somebody threw up a window
and said “ Blanky.” “ I want a box of Liver Lozenges for
Lazy Lovers,” she announced. The chemist placed a
small package in her quivering hand, aud she returned
and made a hearty meal of the contents...
She awoke to find a world full of songbirds. Her veins
ran with liquid energy, and somebody sang a serenade on
the mat. Before she opened the door properly, Walter
was hugging her till she thought she was shooting the
chute.
“Oh ! Walter,” she cried, flushed and eager for some
more, “you are no longer a modern lover. You cuddle
like George La,uri’s prehistoric man.”
Walter lifted his vest and disclosed a band of copper
bars, on which were inscribed “Dr. Boodler’s patent
electric belt.”
And they lived happy ever after. (Advt.)
C.N.
Dr. Corse’s pink pills lay near her hand. She reached
them and swallowed six !!!!!!
Her mood brightened ! Where was the familiar torpor ?
the vacuous brain ? the languid limbs ! ? ! ?
Rushing below she seized the anannic drawing and
achieved a gallery-bit, and returning to her room with
the discarded library-book which in her heaviness of
spirit and dullness? of flesh she could not read, fell into a
long, sweet sleep!
K.A.A.
Two suggested the girl’s recovery—with and
without the aid of another lover:
At midnight she rose and stared dismally into the
mirror opposite. Gradually her eyes brightened. The
wan, tear-stained face grew purposeful.
Jack limes was a man, anyhow, not a sexless egotist.
She thought of the passion in his face, his trembling
hands and hot breath that night when
Her grey dress would do to travel in. She would be
with Jack on Thursday night, and then , . .
Walter 1 Oh, bother Walter.
B.A.A.
Presently sift rose and went to her pretty little writing-
table. The desk on it was a present- from him. Out of
the toy drawer she took a bundle of letters (his) and a
photograph (also Ills). All these she burfied in the fire-
place. Then she sat down at her desk and wrote to.him.
“You are a,fool. Goodbye.”
C.H.S.
These also are inadmissible. As the story was
written, with that honest, quiet kind of girl, and
that slow culmination to a crisis, only two things
were possible—a lingering illness or a sudden
death. In tha actual case it was illness—a long,
slow prostration from which the girl barely
emerged with reason : her health was permanently
broken. In the ending chosen from a similar case
it was death like this :
Towards morning she rose, tottered doivn to the kitchen,
and collected some boxes of matches. She. cut the heads
from the matches, stirred them into a glass of water, and
returned with the glass to her bedroom...
Her lover, when he heard, was surprised and vexed.
“Lucky 1 brought her home early,” he reflected, “or
they ‘d have said I got her into trouble.”
Matches—with the histories of the evening
papers in mind—are a permanent instinct in the
domesticated female. It remains to find .which of
five death-endings “approaches most closely.”
And in the night, the girl died. The verdict? Weak
heart, great mental distress—total collapse. The man
who had ideas of being a painter discovered something
of a conscience away somewhere in the background, and
the verdict of those who ought to know would n't satisfy
its questionings. And all that night, and other nights,
he heard the girl’s passionate “Let’s go wandering by
ourselves—all over the world—anywhere.”
A.B.
A portion of the white, strained sheet was drawn back
disclosing the marble pallor of the dead girl’s features.
There was just fl. faint suggestion of the exquisite expres-
sion still lingering.
The aunt glanced at his face.
No outcry—no emotion !
Still, when he spoke, his voice softened.
“Beautiful!” he murmured, the scene familiarising
under his gaze. “’T will be a fitting subject for my first
picture ! ”
The Modern Lover was inspired.
H.E.R.
Dawning day brought death—rest from the old dis-
turbing emotions. The highly-strung brain which had
struggled to reach love’s topmost heights of bliss suc-
cumbed to cerebral hemorrhage.
Genius did not burn. “ Although,” said the man,
“ undoubtedly I could be great if I wished. But it is a
beastly shock to a fellow when his fiancee dies without
rhyme or reason. It makes him careful about overtaxing
his own strength.”
M.
■When suffering becomes unbearable the human mind is
either stung into madness or sinks into the stupor of un-
consciousness.
The girl’s senses sank into stupor. Awaking in the
grey light of morning she arose with one thought.
“ Oh, God 1 not another day as yesterday ! ”
She crept out into the dawn; walked blindly but
straightly to the cliff...
A leap ! a splash 1... And the sea lay smiling beneath
the rising sun.
H. I. T.
Her head still pained next morning; life felt weari-
some ; her lover continued self-wrapt and nerveless. It
had become her habit to pace, in the weary afternoons,
the cliffs above the beach.
A few days passed.
They found the poor crushed body on the beach below.
“ Fell over,” was the verdict.
‘ ‘ Terribly sad. ” Thus her lover. ‘ ‘ Must join the class
next week.”
Only the grim cliffs knew the truth.
'r.k.
The “non-suicides” approach less closely to the
actual ending. Neither of the “ suicides ”is quite,
in the style of the original; but U.K.’s is nearest,
since he adds the lover’s comment. To Robert
Kaleski, Liverpool, N.S.W., 10s. (>d. has been

A USTRALIAN DECORATIVE ART
O such thing exists. To the thinking pub-
lie this want should appear as a national
l disgrace from the artistic standpoint; as
* a national Loss, commercially. Large
prices are paid for imported furniture, carpets,
fittings, hangings and wall coverings; partly for
the reason that the corresponding Australian
article is not on the market. We need work
carried out by Australians in Australian material,
the designs derived from plant and animal forms
typically Australian. For the artist capable of
making a determined effort in this direction the
field is unlimited.
Of course there are difficulties to be overcome.
In many cases craftsmen must be trained, and
machinery set up, before anything practical can
be done. The public must be educated to ask for
the truly Australian product. One great disad-
vantage to the individual designer is the non-
admittance of applied art to the usual art exhibi-
tions, notably NiS.W. Art Society’s. But ip time
designers ancl craftsmen will hold their own'exhi-
bitions, independently of the picture-makers.
Jt
The artist who sets out to collect material for
Australian designs will be overwhelmed by the
number and variety of his subjects. To the
patriotic Australian native the task cannot fail to
be intensely interesting and delightful. Our two
FIG. 1.
larger animals, the
kangaroo and emu,
are most useful on a
scale much smaller
than life, and show
to best advantage
when in motion.
Either looks well
chasing along a
frieze, or forming a
panel across' large
curtains ; and in
both cases they
might be stencilled.
The native bear,
in his chubby com-
pactness, suggests small editions in wood-carving
to be used in ornamenting chairs, bedsteads, or
large presses made from Australian woods.
Cockatoos adapt themselves to all sorts of flat
designs; the curves in their wing-feathers when
in flight, and the erected crests, give fine, sweep-
ing lines. Many small animals—the wallaby,
platypus, tiger-cat, paddymelqn, bandicoot, and
kangaroo-rat can be applied to outside decorations
in terracotta or cement, introduced among Aus-
tralian foliage. The little marsupial mice, on the
other hand, hop quite at home across small curtains
or chair covers.
Anyone who has come upon a sheet of water
covered with black swan will not easily forget
their unique beauty and grace, and will see at
once how they may be applied to long spaces of
wall-panelling. Among many birds, the lyre-bird
may be especially mentioned as suited to design-
ing for frets, which may be used to break up the
backs of wooden chairs or other spaces where the
light will show through.
J*
For trees we have the gums, endless varieties,
each differing in the colour and grouping of its
foliage and the marking and character of its trunk.
The whole tree and groups of trees come into the
designer’s field for friezes, carving, or modelled
work. The ghe-oak has quite a character of its
own, with its shades of dull green arid brown and
its prickly cones. The wild cherry forms a striking
contrast to the trees surrounding it, golden-green
among the blue-greens of gum and wattle. Its
fruit is toe small to be of any use to the designer,
who must be content to take it as a whole.
The flower of the wattle must be greatly
simplified and used in masses.; the tea-tree and
bottle-brusli, myrtle and clematis, are, of course,
PIG. 2.
only suitable for small designs, as also the much-
abused flannel-flower. This last would work up
well into an all-over design for light curtains, if its
informal habit of growth were carefully preserved.
The waratah, the especial flower of New South
Wales, must not be forgotten. In contrast to the
flannel-flower, this plant is strong-minded and
assertive, and will utterly refuse to be made to
curl about or flow in graceful volutes. Humour
her vanity and she will condescend to preside
regally wherever you decide to put her.
je
In designing for carpets, an ex-treme conven-
tionality is necessary, as the pattern must appear
quite flat and look the same from any of the four
sides of the room. Foliage and flowers are there-
fore most useful, since animal forms under the
feet'give a disagreeable impression. The native
honeysuckle will form an excellent carpet design,
the flower masses treated quite simply and the
leaves symmetrically arrayed. Many of the
smaller plants may be used for hammered or cast
fittings, inlay or painted marquetry, woven and
stamped fabrios.
Where machinery is not available much may be
done by hand stencilling. On a great variety of
fabrics this work gives the same effect as printing
by machinery, and should hjave the added virtue
of artistic individuality. Like printed work, also,
it will wash when the staining is done on washing
materials. For friezes, remarkably good effects
are got by stencilling on silk-fibre and crape
, papers, and also on various prepared canvasses.
The three designs given herewith are selected
from the work of Miss D. M. Adams, of Sydney,
who makes a specialty of this method as applied
to fabrics and wall coverings, using principally
Australian designs. Fig. lis taken from a
waratah pattern, to be carried out as a panel
on an overdoor of cream saddle-cloth in shades of
crimson and green. The width of the panel is
five feet. Fig. 2is a frieze to be carried out either
directly on the wall-or on a paper, to be after-
wards fixed in place. The depth of the frieze is
eighteen inches ; the colours, green for the foliage

and grass, pale blue for the sky, and blue-green
for the tree trunks. Fig. 3 shows a border for a
table-cloth, the design derived from the gum-leaf
and blossom, carried out in terracotta (for the
flowers), and shaded greens (for the leaves) on a
background of peacock-blue serge.
J.B.M.
DE RELIGIONE
A lean, grey house ; a hillside garden opening to
the sea: in the low distance a black curate.
“Don’t go to sleep under The Sunday Sinner,
Aubrey. Someone is coming up the road."
“Didn’t I tell you? It ’s Timmins. Met him
coming from my swim. Said he cl been to an early
euchre party, or something. He asked who lived
here. I told him—a Red Pagan.”
“A Red Pagan !”
“Didn’t you say you were? Religion is just
life refracted through the nearest medium. For
the Puritan life was a tallow .candle in a sewer :
for U, Pagan it is moonlit* ocean when the eyes of
the stars are dead. A world bankrupt of emotion
made its medium muddy, it’s a pijlpit lie that
men are made by their creeds : they- make money
out of them—if they-can. We bred teligiori;for a
watchdog, and it bit the cook. Morality is the
ueck-to-knee costume of mediocrity ; but there’s a
nakedneSs that -isn’t ugly. You. arid I worship
beauty in its skin, instead of obesity in shoddy.
The saints were always filthy, and sinners once
used to be white. That’s what I’m going to tell
Timmins.”
“Well, don’t give your disciples the'serpent
head-first ; lot them begin swallowing at the
tail. When I read my essay on ‘The New
Paganism ’ to the Improvement Society the Dean
said he was glad to see it was just the same as the
old piety. You remind me I have said that te-
ligion is reflection; our gods are all atavism
disguised in futurity. But don’t make the truth
a hedge of spears. Make it a feather bed, and
you will never lack converts. As I put it to the
Dean, we are endowed with our mirror-emotions
to catch the white light of beauty. Why did God
make man in His own image ? Surely it was that
we might have no need of idols. The Greeks had
beautiful gods because they were themselves beau-
tiful. An ugly civilisation breeds an ugly faith ;
a faith sprung from sea-foam keeps sweet; one
born on a rag-pit becomes a parasite on its Deity.
Nowadays, reljgions try to avoid destruction by
aid of Protective Mimicry. When Art captured
the Suburbs curates dressed in sunflowers. Science
oiice was profanity to tlie pulpit. Now Huxley
would be a Professor of Theology at St. Andrew’s,
and edit an Encyclnpcedia Biblica. Why did you
get it out ? Did you think it was published by
the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge?”
“Oh! I just found your best epigram in St.
Augustine. I thought a Bishop might have col-
lared your creed.”
“ My creed ! ”
“ I believe in one Eustace, maker of moments.
He descended into hell and wrote leaders for
the ”
“Never mind the white devils with pearly
wings. Here’s the black curate.”
(A Red Pagan! Dear me! My Pulpit Man-
ner...) “My dear young friend, and you, sir,
who, I am told—but, really, you look quite
English !”
“No! As an up-to-date Missionary I wear the
war-paint of the civilised.
“And have you many conversions?”
“Oh ! yes. The sweet whiteness of our Pagan
Faith attracts, all who are young enough to enter
the kingdom of heaven. But, mon ami, we judge
not missions by their visible result. I pass along
your Via Georgia and meet only the slaves of
Common Sense. I say to them, ‘My friends,
where are your exquisite objectless superstitions,
your Aphrodite of Pearl, your Diana of Silver?
Plave ye even Hymns to the Lottery and the
Ledger in place of Purple Pan? Where is the
pale, snowy night of your Youth? Worship not
vour Working Day. Worship rather the ruby
lips of Night: Nigfit when the young white God
folds sleeping Silence in his amorous arms ”
“ Dear me ! of course I cannot believe in your
religion, but I can sympathise with your regret.
Our own clergy are seriously asking themselves
‘Do we believe ? ’ If there really is a demand
for Paganism in the pew, we must try to intro-
duce it into the pulpit. But what is faith, my
friends ? Is it not the shadow of things forgotten,
or shall we call it the mirage of eternity on the
desert of life. ✓ Can we lack faith in our shadow ?
Can we disbelieve in ourselves? Religion surely
will last for ever ; for the Encyclopcedia Biblica,
which I see under Aubrey’s head, has taught us
that it is the disembodied spirit of all we do not
know.” ■ -
“ Quite so, Mr. Timmins. I see your Mr. Hal-
dane makes religion a pathway to unreality, and
even your worst morality ceases to exist when
you begin to practise it. Mr. Mallock, when he
found nothing behind the ‘ Veil of the Temple,
had no difficulty in believing it. The ‘ content ’
of the creed, after all, matters nothing. You
yourself look less black under that scarlet
hibiscus.”
“I think I am catching your colour, my dear
Mr. Eustace. We try to make religion a chame-
leon of the soul. I have heard our dear Bishop
talk very like you. He tells the exegesis class
that Christian evidences invariably destroy faith.
Always avoid facts in controversy, he says, and
the faithful in a business deal. Surely the Church
has still much in common with the World. The
religious mind has many mansions. It must learn
not to mix its visiting lists. We try to make
our Church quite as safe as Society. We never
mention the sins our congregation has left at
home. Let us come cheerfully to the World and
say, ‘ Of course we can never be like you, but we
will be as like you as we are able to be.’ ‘ Empty
your creed,’ said the Vicar in the vestry, ‘and
you will fill your collection-plate. They like the
big drum of eternity hollow ’! ”
“Oh ! Eustace has something like that. Society
and its Saviour are always very much alike.
Mahomet wears a scimitar, and the Jew a crown
of thorns. Once devotees tried to discover original
sin. To-day the divorce-court tries to discover
original sinners. History does n’t repeat itself
there. Other people repeat it, and the recitation
is not usually a success. That’s why the judges
are so impeccable in private life.”
“ Confession helps us Anglican-liomans in the
siime way, I think. There are not nearly enough
new temptations to go round. I wish you would
come to St. Sweven’s. We have ruby altar lights
and a hearlet anthem. We do not object to Red ! ”
“No! Aubrey was as white as a surplice till
he became a choir boy ! You have forgotten the
pallid ideals of the Semite and the Slave. Self-
sacrifice only satisfies the sinner who would starve
anyhow. A Gospel of Negations won’t suit a full
stomach ; the fed man hungers for Life ; but Virtue
needs only be hideous so long as we are ugly. You
yourself, Mr. Timmins, are still young enough to
be truly Pagan if you could escape the symbiosis
of society. You must let.me take you back to
Samos
“There is much in what you say, Mr. Eustace.
I fear our saints were all sinners, judging by their
autobiographies. Their lives were better than
their creeds ! Only conquer the world and you
will find the Church eager to embrace your
Mission. Will you let Aubrey give me some of
those criipson poppies for our altar ? Thanks. No !
The Bishop will nob object. They never object to
anything now—exoept when Marie Corelli con-
verts a minor canon to a belief in the creeds.
Have you a Missionary Box ? No ! Benedicite!
.Pax V obiscum ! So glad to have met you ! Good-
bye!”
“Hear heart! Aubrey; the Church to the
World! The Shrine tothePaganJ Well hereis the
Night at last ! The Sun of our too enlightened Age
is drowning in the West. Come down to the
boat-house. We will wait for Apollo and the
golden moon. Are you a young Dionysus ? See,
the last of the Curate ! Morituri te salutant!

PROR[?]
Whitakers Peerage (Lond.; 3s. 6 d. net). The
standard handbook of British titles and indigni-
ties. One reflects that titles and their train of
formulae bring 1 many useless folds into a compli-
cated life. 0 that Jones would content to be
known as plain Jones evermore ! Amen. “Years
hence perhaps may dawn an age.
Whitaker's Almanack (Lond., 2s. 6d. net).. Thi*
useful publication earns a word of criticism. The
proprietor ’s preface states that the book is not
intended to “ become fossilised,” yet half of it has
become. Every year Whitaker’s purchasers throw
away a Whitaker , made practically worthless;
since the new facts and statistics supersede the
old, and there is but small further reason for
reference. The result is that one pays over and
over again for the same information (except our-
selves, who get a copy for nothing that we may
point out valuable truths like this). Compare the
French Almanack Hachettc —what a contrast be-
tween alert France and hidebound Britain!
Every year the indispensable minimum is brought
up to date ; and every yeSr the almanac undergoes
substantial changes by the addition of topical
features such as maps of the current war, and
articles of more permanent interest which space
will not permit to be repeated yearly. Every
year Whitaker is stale; every year Hachettc is
fresh. The cloth H. costs Is. 7 d., compared with
W.’s 2s. G d. net. H. is full of interesting illus-
trations; W. has none. It follows that H.
does n’t go out of date on 31st December, and the
publishers sell for Qd. a twelve years’ index to the
whole. Of course, W. is valuable—valuable de-
spite itself ; but much of the matter is worthless
in Australasia, and much of the remainder wants
varying and brightening.
, —
By some machination of the Evil One (taken as
the. personification of the forces that drag huma-
nity backwards through a black mass of errors), a
couplet (7th) was last week omitted from Swin-
burne’s parody of Tennyson, and now is added re-
sentfully :
Body and spirit are tivins: God only knows which is
which: . .
The soul squats down in the flesh, like a tinker drunk: in
a ditch.
Cooling and rest-giving, doubtless, the tinker finds
the ditch. So, by a pleasant reversal, we ask to-
day’s materialism to cure ills of the spirit, instead
of, like our forefathers, invoking spiritualism to
cure the ills of the flesh.
The wheels within the wheels of N.S.W. Art So-
ciety have made another revolution. The Society has
suddenly reached the conclusion of its critics that
too much Govt, money was being spent on cakes
and ale (“ art union ” and ‘ ‘ entertainments ) and
too little on instruction, and has notified that the
starved instructor’s fees are to be exchanged tor
a salary of 150 Z. a year. But instead of rewarding
A. J. Fischer, the teacher who has borne the
burden, the Society has dismissed him—in order,
it is said, that a waiting member of Council maj
take the better-paid billet. Fischer gets a testi-
monial from forty regular students who prefer hie
teaching, and—the thanks of the Council for nis
loyal and devoted service.”

Dear Sirs, —I am writing- to tell you what
your Belt has done for me. I had suffered
for two years with Kidney and Bladder
Troubles, and have been under three doctors,
but they did me no good. After wearing your
Belt for nine months the pains have entirely
disappeared, and I now feel splendid. I wiil
recommend your Belt to anybody I ;■ ee ailing,
and you are welcome to make any use you
like of this testimonial.
Yours truly,

Dear Sirs, —I have suffered with Chronic
Lame Back for years. Some time ago I pur-
chased one of your High-Grade Electric

am pleased to inform you that the result in
my case was marvellous. I feel better now
than I have felt for the past ten years. My
advice to any man who is suffering with a bad
back is to get one of Dr. McLaughlin’s Electric
Belts, for it will cure when all other treatment
fails. I remain, yours gratefully,

Rifle and Pistol Cartridges.
The proof of the pudding is the eating; the proof of
the cartridge is its shooting. The great popularity
attained by Winchester rifle and pistol cartridges
during a period of over 30 years is the best proof of
their shooting qualities. They always give satisfac-
tion. Winchester .22 caliber cartridges loaded with
Smokeless powder have the celebrated Winches-
ter Greaseless Bullets, which make them cleaner to
handle than any cartridges of this caliber made.
ALL SUCCESSFUL SPORTSMEN USE THEM.

Verses of Regret.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“ For What is Your Life?”
A watching in vain for the reaping
Of a harvest that never was sown ;
A waiting in wistfullest patience
By a nest whence the brood has flown ;
A digging dry wells in the desert
Where never a drop is shed ;
A bringing of gifts to the altar
Whose ashes are grey and dead.
The treasures we eloseliest cherish
Time touches, and lo ! they are dust
We weave, and the moth doth consume it ;
We forge, and the iron is rust!
The hopes we let loose in the morning,
Like palpitant doves from our hands,
Are frozen ’ere night on lone mountains.
Or perish ’mid waterless sands.
Poor fools of beguiling delusions,
What boots it to struggle or weep ?
Fore-fated to find what we wish not,
And lose what we long to keep !
The bread that we cast on the water,
For succor of after needs,
Lies rotting on festering beaches
With sedges, and wrack, and weeds.
0 sorrowful, ceaseless endeavor,
What profits the life that we spend ?
We break, and at last are broken—
Frail potsherds no potter can mend.
We come, but the way of our coming
Is a trail that is hid from the sight;
We go, and the way of our going
Is a passage of birds in the night.
N.e.w.
T. J. HEBBLEWHITE.
The Widow.
I shall keep no watch to-night.
Others, underneath the stars,
Set their great bonfires a-ligbt,
Crimson leaping into white,
While I close my bolts apd bar 3.
I shall keep no watch to-night !
Let the old year die alone.
Did he weave one thread aright ?
Did he leave one streak of light
In a world that black has grown ?
Let me slumber, if I may,
In a dark and shuttered room.
No ! I will not even pray.
Prayers like mine the gods gainsay.
Only silence—only gloom.
Do not fan the smouldering spark.
Let me be. Come not again.
Laugh not loud, lest in the dark
I should turn, and, waking, mark
Emptiness, where Love hath lain.
I shall heed no revelry,
And no vigil shall I keep.
In Life’s rifled treasury
Two good things are left for me—
One is Death, and one is Sleep.
Q.
M. FORRES.
In Memory.
“ He must have sleep,” we said. Agair,
Forc’d by the fever-stricken brain,
The weary, weary, little head
Toss’d to and fro upon the bed,
Seeking for restfulness—in vain.
The drooping eyelids, drawn with pain.
Said, wordlessly, but, ah ! how plain—
Poor baby lids, so flush’d and red ! —■
“ He must ha\ e sleep.”
The head lay still, a flutt’ring vein,
A smile that trembled —and the lane
Had reach’d its turning : he was dead.
Aye, Death had, pitying, seen and said—
Stooping to loose Life’s chafing chain —
“He must have sleep !”
N.s.w.

"When I Said Goodbye.
Wet was the dew on thy slopes, Dunkeld,
Velvety emerald where diamonds lie.
Green were the uplands that dipped and swelled
And stretched away to where, towering high,
The mountains stood out ’gainst the morning sky.
And the million leaves of the red gum trees
Fluttered and glistened and swung in the breeze
That fair Spring morn when I said goodbye.
Sweet was the magic the morning held,
Under the blue of that clear soft sky,
When last I stood by thy stream, Dunkeld,
The Wannon water soft swirling by—
A brown flood shaking the brown reeds nigh ;
And the random music the bush birds made
Rang out in gully and ferny glade,
That sweet Spring morn when I said goodbye.
Is the old sheep bridge standing yet, Dunkeld,
Where at night in the rushes the musk-duck cry ?
Do the wattles bloom over the Gap, sweet-smelled,
Where the deeper shades gather as dusk draws
nigh ?
And the still lagoons where the wild swans fly
When the pink west fails, and the stars look down
On silent mountain and scattered town —
Are they still as they were when I said
good-bye ?
I will stand no more by the streams, Dunkeld ;
For never my wandering feet turn I
To the old bush ways of my girlhood’s days—
They are all a part of the years gone by;
Tho’ I oft-times dream with a smile and a sigh
Of the old blue range and the old brown river,
I knew I had lost them for ever and ever
That long-past morn when I said good-bye.

This is to people who lack courage, whose nerves are
shaky, whose eyes have lost the sparkle, whose brains are
muddled, ideas confused, sleep restless, confidence gone,

they are afraid of failure, who want somebody to decide for
them. It is to people who have part or all of these symp-
toms of nervousness and want new life, new force. We

«
Seems to Possess Strange
and Mysterious Power over
Disease.
Offers His Services Free to
the Sick and Afflicted,
Distance no Barrier.
For the past three years foopunts have come from
America of the most astonishing- nature, regarding
marvellous cures that were being performed daily by the
famous physician and scientist, Dr. James W. Kidd.
At first these stories were reoeived with considerable
doubt, but there continued to come reports of men aM
rht
women being- restored to health after years of suffering l .
Chronic and so-called incurable invalids were brought
back to perfect health. There seemed no affliction or
disease but what he might cure. Thousands of patients
were treated by the doctor until his name and the fame
of. his marvellous remedies spread all over the civilized
world. Investigation has proved every assertion made by
Dr. Kidd. Some of the stories told and letters received
from grateful patients seem to indicate that this man’s
remedies possess a mysterious power over disease. No
matter how severe the case, how chronic, or how long -
si inding, what other men have said or failed to do. These
are the cases he especially solicits, because they give him
a chance to prove his superior ability.
When asked the secret of his success, the doctor
modestly answers that it is partly due to the wonderful
remedies which he uses and partly to the careful attention
given each case. He treats patients all over the civilized
world by mail, and seems equally as successful as though
they were present in his office. His greatest ambition is
to give every sick, afflicted and suffering man.and woman
in the world a chance to try his wonderful treatment. In
an interview recently the doctor said: “I believe that
I have discovered a way to relieve 7 most of the suffering
from sickness and disease in the world, and I believe that
duty *as far as possible to make this fact known i o
all. For this reason, lam offering to send a free treat-
ment to every applicant, rich or poor, no matter whefe
they live, no matter what their disease. lam not a rich
man. I cannot afford to always give my medicine away
but I am going to continue as long as possible or until
every afflicted person has had a chance to try and satisfy
themselves without expending one penny.” Do you
mean that you will send treatment absolutely free to every
one who applies? was asked. “That is exactly what I
mean. Any sick or afflicted person who will write to me
and describe their condition may have a trial of this treat-
ment entirely free. There are no conditions, no restric-
tion. Distance is no barrier. I cure as readily thousands
of miles away as in my office. A letter does just as well
as a personal visit.”
The above statement appeared in all the leading
American papers and from there to tne English press. As
a result Dr. Kidd’s mail has been flooded with applications
for free treatment. All have been answered promptly,
but still they continue to come. For the benefit of his
thousands of patients in the British Empire the doctor has
been compelled to establish an office in London. To
secure a free treatment, it is only necessarv to address Dr.
James W. Kidd, 486 Saracen Buildings, Snow Hill, London,
E. 0., being sure to describe your case. Remember that
the doctor treats all diseases from the simplest and
easiest cured to the so-called incurable and chronic
afflictions. There is lie disease that he may not cure.
In view of Dr. Kidd’s marvellous success, his standing
among America’s most famous physicians, his reputation
for honesty and integrity, this offer affords a remarkable
opportunity to all who are sick and ip need of medical
■ help. It means a chance to get well. It means the
i opinion and advice of one of the world’s most famous and
successful physicians on your case absolutely free.

THE GHOULISH UNDERTAKING
BUSINESS
As an advertisement for its burying business
an enterprising Sydney firm is distributing pocket
thermometers to the public. This touting-gift is
suggestive in more ways than one : possibly the
hint is that the clients of this undertaker will find
it useful in the next world ; perhaps rather the
idea is that the thermometer will be useful to the
friends of a sick man, reminding them when it
registers above 107 that death is at hand and it’s
time to ring up and order him a wooden over-
coat. The undertaker’s gift thermometer does not
initiate—perhaps, unhappily, does not even com-
plete—a long series of advertising contrivances by
rival body-grabbers. The competition in the
planting business is keen, and keen is the adver-
tising fight. If one firm sends a Christmas
calendar to gladden the heart for its grapple with
the season’s festivity, another promptly responds
with a New Year reminder that life is fleeting,
displayed in an elegant tombstone-and-violets
design. Should one pushing undertaker join the
Gladsome Elks friendly society and become the
life and soul of its lodge meetings as a means of
mortgaging for himself the job of planting the
corpses of his brother members, another hastens
to enrol among the Jubilant Zebras and to
take a profound interest in their sick pay
distribution. One ghoul is a shining light
in one church ; a second hands round the plate for
another, probably reckoning on the good offices of
the clergyman to let him know when the gates of
Heaven are swinging-to for one of the flock. An
odd undertaker takes to yachting, and, amid the
south-easterly squalls, his craft blots the blue,
with pleasure at the helm and a body-planting
advertisement on the main-sail. A generous
patronage of sport suggests itself to yet another
as a good means to business, and he strives to
become as prominent on the turf as beneath it.
* * * *
The hoardings everywhere proclaim the advan-
tages of death and burial. The shop-windows of the
undertakers plead hard the case for underground,
with display of gorgeous coffins, decked out with
all the trappings of ostentation. Nor is newspaper
advertising neglected. Generous subsidies to the
advertising columns of the dailies secure admission
to their news columns of the undertaker’s puff
item, “ Deceased was, in fact, an excellent citizen
and a man of great public spirit. The funeral
arrangements w T ere admirably conducted by
is a near approximation to a type of para-
graph which is always appearing. A popular
undertaker whose account for a year’s ad-
vertisements runs to hundreds of pounds is
never refused mention, and should he invent
a new method of embalming, a patent
fire-and-damp-proof case, or a coffin lid that will
screw down tightly enough to bury a bad reputa-
tion, the newspapers rush to trumpet his fame,
besides always “mentioning his name” in the
ordinary funeral paragraph. In return the under-
taker sees to it that his clients advertise their
sorrows freely, and the friendship of the ghoul and
the newspaper is thus fixed firm on a platform of
mutual benefit. Not to neglect any chance of
potoriety, the hungry tout for corpses often
takes the additional precaution of making a funeral
of any expensiveness an advertising parade
for his plumes, carriages, coffins and horses. The
“ cortege,” as he calls it, is spread over as many
of the busy streets as possible, so that all may see
and admire, and conclude to be buried handsomely
by such a progressive firm. Energetic canvassing
completes the methodsof pushing trade. Following
on the footsteps of Death comes the undertaker s
man in rusty black to persuade the distraught
widow or the grief-stricken father that sorrow can
be shown in but one way—with plumes and car-
riages, adorned coffins and newspaper advertise-
ments. The shock of Death has made his task
easy. It is a benumbed intelligence that he leads
captive, and money that might comfort the widow
and the orphan is wasted, and worse than wasted,
in a ghoulish and obscene ostentation of grief.
Thus Tragedy is degraded to Trade, and Death
finds an added sting in the funeral bill.
* * * •
Something of humor of a grim sort is there in
this eager grab for a last profit out of the dead.
Blit that does not give it an excuse. A certain
mordant grotesquerie is natural to ci vilisation. It
finds alike its best expression and best defence in
the gargoyles of a Gothic cathedral. A little of
the mordant is tolerable, unavoidable. But when
the ugly, the unpleasant, the obscene, come to be
interwoven closely into every piiase of life, when
the undertakers’ trumpets blare from every news-
paper and their coffins gape in every street, when
no home and no grief is sacred from their bag-
men’s tricks, there is necessity for drastic reform.
The dead in a wholly savage community are
treated with more respect than in the modern
cities of competing undertakers. The Temple
vacant of its life, for what it has been, demands
reverence. For what it will be, prompts to a,
quick removal. There is no reason why it
should be trapped out in gorgeous cere-
ments ; its regard for such vanities has passed.
A decent haste, that the glory which Life
gave may not be forgotten in the disgust
which decay will bring, is all that is fitting.
To grant less is savage ; to offer more is
worse than savage. Pomp of plumes, ostentation
of ornaments, ghoulish bargaining and chaffering
to make a profit out of “respect to the dead,” is
as indecent as it is foolish. And yet is inevitable
whilst the duty of hiding the dead is a matter of
business, and the keenness of modern competition
urges rivals in the trade of burying to seek always
new means to swell their profits and advertise
their calling. There is but one sane remedy—to
take the matter altogether out of the hands of
private peddlers in funeral furnishing and entrust
to a public body the decent burial of all the dead.
* * * *
Were the Labor party, which has taken upon
itself the responsibility of being the leader in
Reform, gifted with any imagination, it would
long ago have made a plank of its platform the
municipalisation of burials. If the undertaking
business was put in the hands of the State or the
municipalities there would be no call for ghoulish
advertisements or for the touting which shocks
public decency. Every corpse would be buried
reverently and quietly, and there would be no
possibility of a grief-stricken widow being hustled
out of her last few pounds to find plumes and
carriages and silver-plated ornaments for the clay
in the casket. But, unfortunately, the Labor
parties in the various States seem to take but
little interest in matters which are of social rather
than of strictly “labor” reform. Else would the
scandal of private undertaking have been settled
long ago ; for the system can have no disinterested
friends, and only awaits attack to be abolished.
THE AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL.
“ W.8.M.” writes to The Bulletin
Is there any reason, anyhow, to choose a Federal capital
just now ? It is said that any long- delay in finding a seat
of Government is baseness and deception to N.S.W. This
is not so; for, at the first referendum, a majority of electors
of N.S.W. voted for the Bill that left the question to the
Federal Parliament. What was good for a majority in N.S. W.
on this point was quite good enough for th e rest of Australia.
Is anybody or anything going to burst with impatience ?
The site will be settled all right, just as much other
Federal business will be settled sooner or later—the later,
perhaps the better. Why not defer the matter for, say,
a decade from the establishment of Federation ? Mel-
bourne has already been the temporary seat of Govern-
ment for four years ; let Melbourne have it for another
year ; then let Sydney have a loan of the temporary
arrangement for the next five years. Before that time
there may be some amendment of the Constitution. The
.Constitution Act says “ Parliament shall meet in Mel-
bourne until it meets at the seat of Government.”
At first sight, that looks fatal to Sydney as a
temporary alternative. But, at the second sight, there’s
not much difficulty in the way. That particular sub-sec-
tion of the Constitution can be suspended by the Federal
Executive with the tacit consent of the Federal Parlia-
ment. There is a precedent for this : The Constitution of
the Cape Parliament provides for annual Parliaments, yet,
during the war, the Cape Parliament did not meet for two
years, and when it did meet it passed several indemnifying
Bills covering unconstitutional acts of omission and
administration. The Federal Parliament might similarly
indemnify the Federal Executive. That about which
there is a general agreement cannot be contrary to the
spirit of the charter of a free and responsibly governed
people. I take it that there is no popular demand for the
prompt building, at great expense, of a capital at Dal-
gety, or anywhere else. At any rate, there will be no
great objection to Sydney having a turn of the temporary
capital for five years, commencing 12 months hence. It is
the elasticity of the Federal Constitution that is its
greatest strength.-
There could be no more unpatriotic proposal
than this for the nullification of the explicit
instructions of the Constitution with regard to the
capital. A vitally important provision of that
Constitution was the mandate to the Federal
Legislature to build up, as soon as might be, a
hearth and home for Australian nationalism, a
citadel for the Union’s Government, safe from the
narrow jealousies of the provincial cities. Acting
happily in the spirit of the founders of the Federa-
tion, the Australian Parliament has now chosen a
noble site for the Federal city, and “W.8.M.”
would have it go back on its wise decision and
defer at this late stage to the promptings of a
narrow provincialism.
* * * *
The plea represents the feelings of a small and
altogether misguided section of Sydney and Mel-
bourne folk, who-have been mainly responsible for
the bitter clamor which has surrounded this great
question from the outset. It was in response to
that clamor that the Federal capital was allotted
to New South Wales, in order to conciliate
Sydney’s jealousy of Victoria. The temporary
meeting of the Federal Parliament in Melbourne
was for much the same reason arranged to subdue
that city’s jealousy of New South Wales; the
latter provision was, also, probably intended to
hasten, with the stimulus of its jealousy of Mel-
bourne, the selection of a Federal site by New
South Wales. But the prompt founding of a new
Federal city was never lost sight of by our Consti-
tution’s builders, who saw in it not only a neces-
sary piece of Federal machinery, but also a protest
against the centralisation of population, and _a
means of establishing a new centre in Australia
of human activity, under such conditions as would
make the increased values of the lands surround-
ing it largely contributory to the expenses of the
central Government. “W.8.M.” now seriously
proposes to abandon all this beneficent purpose,
to set Sydney and Melbourne more bitterly than
ever at variance, and to postpone indefinitely, if
not for ever, the choice of a suitable site, ignoring
altogether the wise plans of the great national
Convention for the speedy and inexpensive foun-
dation of a Federal capital.
* * * *
To follow the course of double-dealing suggested
would constitute an act of treachery which the
people of Australia would bitterly resent at the
first opportunity. After a great battle against
the Tory forces of provincialism, the six States
accepted the Constitution on the understanding
that its provisions would be carried into effect
with all reasonable rapidity. Now we are asked
to believe that the people will readily consent to
anv evasion of the Constitution which the unscru-
pulousness of the politicians may suggest. Up to
a certain point the apathy of the Australian in
politics is proverbial, but it is impossible to
believe that it would be carried to such an extent as
to tolerate now a weak assent to the JohNAYNESES
of N.S. Wales and the Bents of Victoria in the
direction of disregarding one of the chief of those
solemn pledges which form the foundation of our
Act of Union.
* * * *
It is one of the heaviest curses of Australia that
in all her States, save Queensland, some port has
acquired such power and influence, through the
advantages presented to shipping and through the
meeting there of the local Parliament, that the
existence of competing centres of population has
become impossible. The instruction of our Com-
monwealth Constitution with regard to the foun-
dation and site of a Federal Capital was clearly an
attempt to establish at least one other rival to
Sydney and Melbourne, and to provide there
honester, purer, and more equitable conditions —
for the development of clean politics—un-
biassed alike by public pressure and by
press tyranny ; for the growth of healthy
Australian men and women, and of strong
and fervent national sentiment, untinctured with
any local jealousy. And it is at the roots of
this great ideal that the provincialist would hack
at the call of a miserable expediency.
* * * *
Absurd is the argument that it would be cheaper
to have a Federal Parliament which perambu-
lated at intervals of five years, like a sturdy
mendicant, from Melbourne to Sydney, and
then back again, than to establish a per-
manent home and abiding place for the
central Government. It is manifestly ridiculous
to suppose that it can be cheaper to establish and
maintain two Parliament Houses—one in Mel-
bourne and one in Sydney (why not also one each
at Brisbane and Adelaide ?) and two sets of Federal
offices, than to build and maintain one Parliament
House and one suite of Federal buildings, which
will serve our purpose while stone and lime hold
together, while bricks and mortar endure the
ravages of time. And in the Federal territory,
by the wise provision of the Constitution, the
revenue to be derived from the unearned incre-
ment, caused by a sudden aggregation there of
population, will create a fund, which should not
only pay the cost of construction, but which
should also defray many of the expenses
of the central Government. Wherever the
Federal Parliament is established—with its 98
members and its many officers and its army of
civil servants to be fed and housed —there will go
as pioneers, the stonemason, the bricklayer, the
carpenter, the plasterer and the laborer. In the
wake of these will follow the hotel-keeper, the
restaurateur, the butcher, the baker, the grocer,
the milkman, the tailor, the draper and the boot-
maker—all the primary and secondary producers
of civilisation. By these means, there will
arise a demand for land and labor which will
enhance greatly the values of both, and the former
value will be all the nation’s property. But, after
all, the argument of cash profit and loss is not the
most important. The foundation of a Federal
capital will give to Australia a national heart
whose pulsing throbs will be felt throughout the
six states of the Commonwealth, driving through
all their veins and arteries, a strong and healthy
current of vigorous Australian national sentiment
and aspiration, potent for good within our borders
and powerful without to keep at bay the foes
whi ch threaten at our gates.
THE CUKSE OF THE COMMONWEALTH.
Civis Australiensis (a weighty authority on
Australian constitutional law) writes :
The legislation which has been enacted by the Federal
Parliament up to the present time has not fulfilled the
promise of the Constitution. Standing of itself, it would
only be a matter for thankfulness on the part of demo-
crats that the National Ass declares that the net results
of Federal legislation at the end of the-first four years of
the Commonwealth are unsatisfactory. But unfortu-
nately it is not only at meetings of members of the
National Ass, or in other Tory circles, that dissatisfaction
is felt and expressed. Among many democrats whose
political outlook extends beyond the limits of the
platform of the Labor party there is much dis-
appointment at the trend' of Federal politics; and
this disappointment has been produced by the conduct
and utterances of all of the recognised political parties in
the Parliament of the Commonwealth. There are in each
of these parties some members whose aims and utter-
ances have been above the level of the party to which
they belong. But unhappily the body and tail of every
political party frequently compel its best members to
choose between walking with the party through Coventry
or deserting it to the profit of the common enemy.
The controlling influence that has dictated the policy
and conduct of each of the political parties in the Federal
Parliament up to the present time has been provincialism.
It is not so much in the positive provisions of the
legislation of the Federal Parliament that the virus
of provincialism is visible. The evidence of its
existence is found more in the absence of the national
legislation which is necessary to give to the people of
Australia the full benefits of Federation. Sp long as the
several States are compelled to wrestle with financial
difficulties, their representatives in the Federal Parlia-
ment will be compelled, by the exigences of the position,
to regard it as the whole of their legislative duty to watch
and restrict the expenditure of the Commonwealth, so
that there may be as large as possible a surplus to divide
among the States. All national legislation is considered
in the light of that aim. So long, therefore, as financial
embarrassment exists in the separate States, provincialism
will dominate and control the legislation of the Parliament
of the Commonwealth.
It is beyond all dispute that the establishment of the
Commonwealth has created financial difficulties in some
of the States, because the virus of provincialism was pre-
sent in the Convention that framed the Constitution, and
made itself plainly visible in the provisions relating to the
collection and distribution of the Federal revenues. The
one speedy and certain remedy for that financial embar-
rassment is the transfer of the debts of the States
to the Commonwealth. But provincialism has prevented
every Federal Ministry in turn from asking the Federal
Parliament to apply the remedy. If the debts of the
States were transferred to the Commonwealth, the distri-
bution of the surplus revenue from duties of customs
among'the States would cease, and the Commonwealth
would acquire complete control over the disposal of all
the revenues collected under the authority of its own
laws. The finances of each of the States would then be
entirely separated, as they ought to be, from the finances
of the Commonwealth, and the members of the Federal
Parliament would cease to vote as the representatives of
the financial interests of the separate States by which
they were elected. Emancipated from the incubus of
provincialism in its most sordid aspect, they would quickly
learn to act as legislators for the Australian nation.
The objections which have been from time to time
urged against the transfer of the debts of the States to
the Commonwealth have been all based upon an argu-
ment that is dictated by a blind and narrow-minded
provincialism. That argument is that under the Federal
tariff a larger sum per head of the population is collected
from customs and excise duties in some of the States
than in others, and therefore if the debts of the States are
transferred to the Commonwealth a portion of the re-
venue collected from duties of customs and excise in one
or more of the States will be used to assist in the payment
of the interest on the transferred debts of some of the
other States. This argument would be intelligible if the con-
sumers of dutiable articles in each State could be regarded
as paying the duties on such articles on behalf of the
State, and, doubtless, the detestable system of keeping
inter-State accounts of the dutiable articles passing from
one State to another State lends color to such a supposi-
tion. But the provisions of the Constitution in reference
to inter-State accounts are expressly limited to the first
decade of the Commonwealth, and any conception of the
position of the consumers of dutiable articles in each
State as paying duties of customs in perpetuity on behalf
of the State is contradictory of the fundamental purpose
for which the Commonwealth was established, and
of the principles of the federal form of govern-
ment which it creates. The purpose of the exist-
ence of the Commonwealth is the union of
the residents of the separate States into one
community in the application of their energies to all
those industrial and commercial activities from which
revenue, by means of duties of customs and excise, is de-
rived. Almost every power conferred upon the Federal
Parliament by the Constitution has been conferred upon
it to give effect to that purpose, and any discrimination
between the States in the matter of the collection and ex-
penditure derived from duties of customs and excise is a
constant inducement to a conflict of sectional interests in
reference to the contents of the Federal tariff, and is
therefore a perpetual contradiction of the political unity
of the Commonwealth.
In the matter of its annual expenditure upon the
Commonwealth departments there is not any discrimina-
tion between the States upon the basis of the amount of
federal revenue collected in each State. In the cases of
the postal and telegraphic departments, the expenditure
in a large and comparatively more thinly-populated State
will necessarily be more per head of the population than
in a smaller and more thickly-populated State. In the
matter of defence, the Commonwealth could not possibly
shape its expenditure on a population or taxation-receipt
basis. If the assumption of a proportionate part of the debt
of each State by the Commonwealth will be conducive to
the general prosperity and welfare of the Commonwealth,
any objections based upon the varying proportions in
which the several States contribute to the Federal
revenue is as untenable, and as inconsistent with the
political unity of the Commonwealth, as a like objection
would be to any local expenditure for defence purposes
or for postal or telegraphic communication, which did
not correspond with the amount of Federal revenue
collected in the State in which the expenditure took
place.
The financial embarrassment which has been experi-
enced, in a greater or less degree, by most of the States
since the establishment of the Commonwealth, has un-
doubtedly been produced by the surrender of the power
of the States to raise revenue by duties of customs and
excise. The establishment of the Commonwealth is,
therefore, the immediate cause of the present financial
difficulties of the several States, and the power and
resources of the Commonwealth ought to provide the
remedy for them ; and the remedy ought to be com-
mensurate with the sacrifice of revenue which each of the
States has made by its entrance into the Commonwealth.
The sacrifice of revenue from duties of customs and excise
which has been made by each of the States will be per-
petual, and the compensation for that sacrifice ought to
be made in a form that will produce an equally perma-
nent result. A distribution of the surplus Federal
revenue among the States will be only a fluctuating
palliative of the annually-recurring effects of a con-
tinuous cause ; but the assumption of a commensurate
portion of the debt of each State by the Commonwealth
will be the permanent removal of the cause and a perma-
nent aid to the good government of the Commonwealth.
The financial dependence of the States upon a contribu-
tion from the revenues of the Commonwealth is contrary
to the essential character of the type of Federal Govern-
ment which the Constitution purports to create ; and, if
it becomes permanent it will subjugate the whole financial
policy of the Commonwealth to such local agitations as
the Kyabram mania. But an assumption of the public
debts of the States, in such a manner that the transferred
debts shall thereafter be the debts of the Commonwealth,
will put an end to all distributions of Federal revenue
among the States, and will therefore put an end to all
bookkeeping of accounts between the Commonwealth and
the States, in which, unfortunately, provincialism finds a
legal, although only a temporary, recognition in the Con-
stitution. Until provincialism is eradicated from Federal
politics all truly national and democratic legislation will
be found to be difficult, if not impossible.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Profitable and Unprofitable Socialism,
Whenever there’s a business with very little oi
no money in it, the State or the municipality is
the right party to do it. On that point the Fat
Man is a solid Socialist. The Fat Man never lets
his craze for private enterprise lure him into run-
ning a Health Department. He doesn’t build
lighthouses or observatories. If he builds a road
it is to get the money back, with 100 per cent,
added, from the man to whom he hopes to sell a
building allotment. He won’t build a railway out
into the wilderness without the Socialistic lift of
an interest guarantee. The State, in short,
is the proper party to do everything that
has the poorest chance of showing a dividend.
And the socialistic person, always anxious to have
the community doing things for itself, accepts
what the Fatman rejects, and carries it through
with more or less enthusiasm. Presently, when
he suggests something else—banking, insurance,
running a pub., or any of the things with monev
in them—the Argus says it would be a rash and
foolish experiment, and the Daily Telegraph
points to the results of a few of the things that
never had a hope of paying, and ponderously
announces that Private Enterprise always does
better. Even when Private Enterprise doesnt
think too well of the prospects of some business
and allows itself to be bought out, or when
the business has been so badly conducted
that Parliament is driven to make a change,
Private Enterprise generally opens its mouth so
wide that the State can’t make the business pay,
running it decently, because of the burden of
The White Man’s Port Arthur.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
There was joy in Old Japan,
And a thrill of triumph ran
Through the coffee-colored man
When the White Man dipped his standard at
Port Arthur.
To Old Asia there arose
Visions of its hated foes,
And their pow’r, in dying throes,
Falling, as their flag fell at Port Arthur.
Yea ! the thrill in Old Japan
Trembled on to Hindustan—
There was joy in ev’ry clan,
When the Russian reigned no longer at Port
Arthur.
Long beneath the White Man’s heel,
Ranged about with points of steel,
Did they groan—but now they feel
That ’twill end, e’en as it ended at Port Arthur !

ULOOLA.


capital debt with which it starts. Moreover, the
more abominably Private Enterprise fleeces the
public, the keener is the public to have Private
Enterprise cleared out of the way on any terms it
chooses to name. The result, of course, is ‘ ‘ another
Socialistic failure” —which is a lie, because it isn t
a Socialistic failure at all. It is the failure of the
very opposite system—failure inasfar as that sys-
tem mercilessly bleeds the public, and makes the
opportunity to bleed the public so valuable
that even the State can t pay the capital
cost-price and subsequently show fair results.
This is the sort of thing that is in danger of
happening in connection with land repurchase in
N.S.W. ; it has happened already
and to some extent in Queensland. Fortunately
in that case, though, there is a way of getting at
rapacious Vested Interest, which reaps always
where others sow, through a land tax; but in
most other cases it isn’t possible. Yet the chances
are that some day the public will wake up suffi-
ciently to say that there must be a way out, and
it will then insist upon its right to start off in just
what business it pleases. Perhaps it may give
seven days, or seven years, notice to quit. It
may start off on the Tobacco Octopus—
“ Make hay for seven years, and then
we’re going into that business.” It will,
if it is wise, go into the great cof-
fin-making business very early. Almost every-
body has to be buried, and there is more to
be said for monopolising the glioul industry than
almost any other. One municipal concern could
bury Melbourne or Sydney at considerably less
than half the present expense, which mounts up
through waste time, and waste hearse, and waste
horse, and waste rent of the shop with the plaster-
•of-Paris angel swinging in the window. And the
business would be done more decently into the
bargain ; the corpse wouldn’t be carried through
all the principal streets in the busiest part of the
■day at the poor widow’s expense just for the pur-
pose of letting the boss ghoul advertise himself
;and his sooty steeds.
The Situation in Victoria.
Although the Bent Government is the worst that
Victoria could have, it is remarkable how weak is
the Opposition. The Labor Party, since it
assumed the position formerly occupied by
Peacock’s crowd, has signally failed to put before
the people any policy of a national character ; so
that, if a State general election were to
take place in Victoria now, notwithstanding
the Taverner Agent-General job, the Assets-
Realisation Closer-Settlement job, the failure
to carry the Irrigation Bill, and all Bent’s
scandals, the Bent Ministry would be returned
with strong support from the country electorates.
The situation calls for a State Labor party which
will make land settlement the principal end and
aim of its existence, and that party needs to be
strong enough to sweep away all obstacles that
stand in the way—squatters, speculators, shep-
herding farms for a rise, auctioneers and land
estate jobbers in Parliament and out of it, Lands
Department red tape and inefficiency. Such a
party would oppose the granting of too large areas
to farmers without capital, and would favor an
effective credit system for selectors. Victoria
wants its irrigation works taken from the re-
pudiating irrigation trusts and thrown open for
closer settlement under the Crown. It wants a
State Labor party which will be a country party
just as much as a city party, especially now that
the fiscal question has been handed over to the
Federal party. It wants a party which can attract
all the agricultural workers from Service ton to
Croajingolong, and combine them for the closer
settlement of Victoria. It wants leaders who know
more about selectors’ necessities than Henry
George knows, and who have better agricultural
knowledge than Karl Marx. T lie Victorian Labor
party is a city party, pure and simple, which has
no programme and never has thought of any pro-
gramme that will meet the wants of the Victorian
democracy in the country as well as the town.
The consequence of this is that the country
districts do not support this Labor party;
the men who want land (and 10(1,000 persons, at
least, want to select land in Victoria) either
work in with the big landowner, and vote for his
nominee, or do not vote at all. The party has too
many of the qualities of Tom Mann, and not
enough of those of Chris. Watson. It can entertain
.(and scare) the voters in the country with ex-
treme statements; it cannot attract them with
moderate ones. It has too much of the orator,
and too little of the practical politician. It has
too much German Socialism, and not enough
Australian. Just now it has Tom Mann pushing
resolutions in the P.L.C. branches in favor of
petitioning Tom Bent to enact a strange closer
settlement scheme with free seed trimmings
for the unemployed when everybody knows that
a few weeks ago Bent and the ’House of Fat
Landlords refused to put through a proper Closer
Settlement Bill, and what he did pass he has
handed to Squatter Clarice’s fathef-in-law, and
the manager of the Assets Co. - of the Land
Boom to administer. The Victorian State
Labor party has Tom Mann advising the
P.L.C. branches to neglect fiscalism and to
despise the consideration of the industries of Vic-
toria, while at the same time Mann is supposed
to be organising the P.L.C. under a Protectionist
platform, and while Melbourne is suffering under
the ineffective Federal tariff. A party which
despises trade in the cities and settlement in the
country will never get a majority in Victoria.
The Labor party has ideals, and ideals invite
oratory ; but it takes more than oratory to attract
the country voter.

Regrettable Blatancy.
At a recent examination of candidates for appoint-
ment to the clerical division of the Common-
wealth Public Service, this .was the dictation
paper for unfortunate competitors (youths and
girls under 18): —
No assemblage is more unreliable, or more embarrassing
to peaceable diplomacy, than an excitable street crowd
at a juncture which threatens international crisis. Its
turbulent vociferation is not the demand for that inde-
pendent inquiry which shall mete outcondign punishment
to the guilty, but the hysterical wail of an irresponsible
populace for summary vengeance. Hypnotized, as it
were, by the sorcery of some mysterious hallucination, it
becomes demoralized by mere mythical chimeras, the
capricious phantasies of its own pessimistic imagination.
Impatient of the calm judicial atmosphere essential to
the unravelling of a tangled skein of debatable testimony,
it is borne, as by the gyrations of a whirlwind, in diver-
gent directions, by the heterogeneous complexity of
uncorroborated hearsay. Mere primn facie evidence it
deems to be irrefragable proof, and it mistakes a judicious
hesitancy for a vacillating pusillanimity.
Its orator abandons himself to exaggerated hyperbole.
Has a belligerent cruiser overhauled a neutral yacht for
contraband of war, then straightway he stigmatises the
occurrence as a wanton and heinous atrocity, unwarranted,
unparalleled, and unprecedented ; or, in grandiloquent
fustian, he urges that the unsullied maritime prestige of
his ancestral home is menaced and assailed, and the
common weal of all pelagic traffic is in jeopardy.
Such blatancy is regrettable, and it may be fraught
with irremediable mischief. Its tendency is necessarily
to accelerate catastrophe, where more sapient counsel
might conciliate adversaries and avert a disastrous cul-
mination.
The Federal Parliament should consider this
matter important enough for interference. “ Such
blatancy is regretable.” It is worse ;it edges on
to the disastrous. Imagine the early bent given to
the young civil servant’s mind by such nonsensical
blather being put forward as a specimen of English !
Of course it may be pleaded that the object is to
drag in all the big words possible. Giving all due
weight to that, it does not palliate such an outrage
on common sense and on the English language.
The capacity to put down that jumble correctly
would provide no poof of clerical proficiency,
but it would be a deplorable indication of a
“gabby” character —of a bent towards calling an
uncle an “ avuncular relation ” and smirking over
the phrase as “eloquent.” Australia is already
much cursed with the big word and the potted,
rotted phrase that sounds well and means nothing.
The Federal Public Service Commissioner in
putting forward such “grandiloquent fustian ” as
being a sample of English helps to extend a dan-
gerous evil.
The Black Curse Spreads.
A correspondent from the Northern rivers of
N.S.W., where the latest outbreak of plague
comes from :
Till a few years ago the Richmond and the Clarence
(N.S. W.) maize and cane crops kept from 400 to 500 white
workers employed nearly all the time. But slowly the
Hindu came with his filth and rags, and these white men
have lost their living. Hundreds of ignorant Punjaubis
have landed, and more are landing every .year, with their
passages prepaid and under contract, to work at starva-
tion rates for the Hindu “boss” or contractor. The
“ boss” usually speaks English well. He rides from farm
to farm and takes contracts to clear land, strip cane, pull
and thresh maize, at prices which would not keep
a white man in tucker. The men cannot speak
a word of English, and are quite satisfied to get
from five to six shillings a week from the “ boss.”
It is not uncommon, at a cattle sale at Lismore or Grafton,
to see the pick of the yard knocked down to something
brown, whose name is either Khan or Singh. An out-
cry was raised on the Tweed, some little time ago. against
the employment of Hindus at cow-milking. But when a
Hindu (who boasts eternally about being a British sub-'
ject) can, and does, take up land, and enters into the
dairying industry himself, who can prevent his dirty
paws contaminating the milk which is eventually
turned into butter ? This portion of the black evil is but
commencing. When the Hindu finds he can make more
money dairying than in stripping cane, he will dairy, and
the “ Australian ” butter trade will stink in Europe. The
very presence of these men is demoralising. In some
places, a dozen or so will have a white “ housekeeper,”
who is common to them all. There must be nearly 1000
Hindus swarming on the Northern rivers at the present
time. Through their continual faction-fights they have
become a nuisance in the police courts, where they intro-
duce all their native cunning in suborning witnesses, and
the air is filled with black clouds of perjury when they
appear.
The Men of Fighting Age.
One of the most serious features disclosed by the
N.S.W. Census of 1901 was the threatened disap-
pearance of able-bodied men. When the count of
1891 was taken there were 209,589 males of “ mili-
tary age” —from 20, that is, to 40. This was
equal to 187 per cent, of the total population.
Ten years later, the State could muster 223,652 of
“military age,” or less than 16'5 per cent, of the
population. The population as a whole hadn’t
increased at any extraordinary rate, but the
increase of able-bodied men had been far less
rapid than that of the general population.
Defence is a matter which every sane
people must always regard as 9f import-
ance; and in view of the increasing “dog”
of the Jap, defence has become a matter of
enormously increased importance in Australia.
Yet, in proportion to its whole population, N.S.
Wales in 1901 faced the greater need with a far
smaller body of men fit to carry arms than it had
done ten years before. Precisely what the posi-
tion is now it is impossible to say; for a census is
not taken every year. Still, it looks as though,
happily, matters are improving slightly. In the
ten years to the end of 1901 for every 1000 females
who were added to the population of N.S. Wales
only 777 males were added. Throughout the
whole of that time, the male births were more
than maintained ; in the last five years of the
period 94,485 males were born as- against
90,449 females. Still, what emigration took
place was of able-bodied males, leaving an undue
proportion of the very old and the very young,
and thus sending up the death rate per 1000
males far ahead of that of the females. Those
who went away were those who in ordinary cir-
cumstances would have shown a low death rate ;
those who stayed were those who showed a high
death rate. That was down to 1901. Then came
the drought year of 1902, when there ought to
have been an appalling exodus of people, judging
by the pictures in the Sydney daily papers. Instead,
however, of anything of the sort happening, there
was, as a result of the change from bastard Free-
trade to moderate Protection, a much finer increase
of male population than had occurred for years
previously. For 10 years prior to Dec., 1901,
there had been an average annual increase of male
population of 9492. In 1902 the increase was 17,740,
and in 1903 13,857, or together nearly 13,000 more
than it would have been had the State only main-
tained the average of the years before the mode-
rately protective tariff came into force. In the
10 years between the two census years, as already
shown, the male population grew by 777, while
the female grew by 1000. In the two years under
the tariff for which the figures are now avail-
able, the growth has been 1030 males for every
1000 females. The improvement from 777, the
figure of the Freetrade years, to 1030, the figure
of the years of very moderate Protection, would
be striking under any circumstances; it is
more striking still when it is remembered that the
latter years include one which witnessed a com-
plete break-down of the “ great primary producing
industries,” from which, it was alleged, it would
take the State years to recover. Freetrade and
complete dependence upon the “great natural
resources” were fast bringing this State to apitiable
condition, under which it couldn’t put up a decent
defence, no matter what happened ; even very
moderate Protection, accompanied by a widely-
advertised decision to shut out the cheap, un-
desirable workman, has turned the stream the
other way, and it looks as though before long
N.S. W. might be able to show as good “ military
age ” figures as it did before the results of the dry-
rot showed themselves.
The British Protection Campaign.
His Preston speech brought Mr. Joseph Cham-
berlain a big step nearer to a candid declaration
of his real ideas as to tariff reform. In his first
pronouncement on the subject, the wily fox of
British politics masked his attack on Freetrade
with a pretence of sympathy for ‘ ‘ the colonies.” He
did not dare to then suggest that John Bull
should abandon the religion of Cobden, which, with
the Bible and the morning tub, had been so long con-
sidered the bulwarks of England's greatness. Such a
revolutionary proposal would have sent the Bri-
tisher into a state of unthinking shock for 10 years
or so, and Chamberlain is too old a man to wait
10 years for a justification. So he dissembled. It
was not that John Bull’s constitution could not
stand Freetrade any longer. Bull was robust
enough,- and his fetish was good enough. But
there were the poor colonies to consider. Bull
was reminded of his feelings as a father, and urged,
for his children’s sake, to impose a tariff so that he
would be in a position to save them from ruin by
yielding them “preference.” As a matter
of cold brutal fact, the “colonies’” interests
are best served by England remaining Free-
trade, for that ensures them its market at
least as a free one. Therefore, so far as
Australia is concerned, the interest taken in
preferential trade is of the slightest. Probably,
also, it has been from first to last very slight as far
as Mr. Chamberlain is concerned. He wanted
to preach Protection, knew that to do so directly
was to kill all chance of success, and used “the
colonies” as a stalking horse. Now that his cam-
paign has advanced somewhat, and the British
voters have begun, more or less consciously, to
think on the inherent absurdities of Freetrade,
Mr. Chamberlain drops “the colonies” and
preaches straight-out retaliation and Protection.
At Preston all the mention that “ the colonies ”
got was that “ he advocated reasonable preference
and reciprocity with the colonies.” That is as it
should be. Chamberlain is undoubtedly right in
urging upon Britain to drop the folly of Freetrade.
He was just as undoubtedly wrong in his early
statements that “the colonies” were pining for
preferential trade with England, and to secure
that boon would be content to agree to block
the future growth of their own manufacturing
enterprise.

Land-Taxation and Land Settlement.
“Kiwi,” from Maoriland :
The system of buying' land for settlement has now been
in operation in this State for more than 10 years, and I
have no hesitation in saying that, as a solution of the
great land question, it is a failure, besides which it is a
source of wire-pulling and corruption. Think of the
absurdity! We are borrowing money to buy -“runs,”
and we are also borrowing money for public works which,
as it enhances the unearned increment, is making “ runs ”
more difficult to buy. There is no sinking fund to pay
o:f the principal, which accordingly bids fair to become a
debt-in-perpetuit.v ; and, worse still, every settler is a
recruit for the Farmers’ Union. These cockies have as
much love for labor unions as the most purse-proud pas-
toralist, and they will hereafter be the backbone of the
Tory party, and the most strenuous opponents of land-
value taxation. The clamor for the concession to Crown
tenants of the right to buy the freehold is really being en-
gineered by the squatters, who are making catspaws of the
cockies, whose implacable enemies they were a few years
ago ; and the sorriest feature of the business is that the
cocky does not see through the trick. Nothing is more
usual than to see long screeds in the press complaining of
the excessive valuation of properties ; but it is a remark-
able fact that it is invariably the valuation for land-tax
purposes that is complained of. When it is a question of
taking the land for settlemeut, all sorts of devices are
resorted to in order to have the valuations forced as high
as possible. The purchase price of four estates —Hatuma,
Ardgowan, Kumeroa, and Forest Gate —was thus £53,000
in excess of the valuation for land-tax ! From this fact,
either of two conclusions is inevitable —if the land-tax
valuation was correct, the State has paid too much
for the land, and the tenants will have to pay
rent on a spurious value ; if, on the other hand, the pur-
chase price represents the true value, the land-tax was
assessed too low. In either case the facts amount to a
public scandal ; and the cases are not isolated. Another
fact: When the State embarks on the business of buying
out squatters, it must take good and bad land together,
w-herefore the State has at least 10,000 acres of useless
land on its hands, comprising the waste pieces of the
various properties acquired. This land has been
paid for, but the prospect of getting any return out
of it is exceedingly remote, and as a consequence
the loss must be made up out of the tenants
on the better land. Again, although our land-sharks
profess to be horrified at the fact that, under the Land
for Settlement Act, estates can be taken compulsorily if
negotiations do not succeed, it is still a fact that they
prefer being- compulsorily “ expropriated,” for the follow-
ing reasons : When land is taken compulsorily the Land
Purchase Board has no say in the matter, which goes
before a tribunal consisting of a Supreme Court Judge
and two assessors, representing State and owner respec-
tively ; and there is naturally a tendency to deal liberally
with the man who is being compulsorily stripped of his
land. The estates above mentioned were all taken com
pulsorily; and, in fact, the most glaring instances of
extravagant prices have occurred in connection with the
compulsory acquisition of estates. Our whole land history
is driving home the great superiority of a proper land-tax
over any system of purchase. There are to-day more
large estates in Maoriland than before the application of
our land policy—a very different result from what we
would experience from a heavy land-tax. Our existing tax
is a mere flea-bite, and is so vitiated by exemptions that, out
of a total of 115,000 freeholders, not more than 18,000 pay.
Under these circumstances it is deplorable that we have
no political party on the track of the true reform ; for the
Farmers’ Union is simply the National Ass with a new
name ; and the newly-formed Political Labor League,
though it has launched a long programme, has no vital
plan of land reform. True, it asks for periodical re-valua-
tions, but that is a small thing compared with the taxa-
tion of land-values, which, in fact, as The Bulletin has
said, would render re-valuations unnecessary.
♦
Even now it is absurd to say that the N.S.W
Arbitration Act has broken down. As individuals,
some Newcastle men may have done much less
than they should have done. But individuals
cannot maintain a strike. Jt takes a union, with
its accumulated funds, to do that. A few men
may have a trifle put by, but the majority must
look to next week’s work (or next week’s strike-
pay) to provide them and their families with food.
The irresponsible wheeler or other workman may
cause momentary trouble by defying the law ; he
may go on strike for a few days ; but the responsi-
ble union, required by the law to keep its funds
within the State, where they are under the con-
trol of the court, holds a very different position.
Even if the responsible officers, who are not irre-
sponsible striplings, would pay out money, the
Court is able to prevent it. Thus the Arbitration
Act has abolished strike-pay ; and the abolition
of strike-pay makes anything in the nature of a
protracted strike impossible. Without this Act the
price of coal would by this time have been soaring
up. As it is, everybody knows that the trouble
can’t last, and so the price has been hardly
affected.
In the Independent Review for December, 1904,
G. M. Trevelyan, writing on “ Religious Con-
formity,” tells some bitter truths about religion in
England :
The conventional motive is the most important with
some, at any rate, of those who practise an insincere or
thoughtless conformity. The fear of seeming eccentric,
the prime need to appear oomme il faut is often far
stronger than the love of religious truth. . , The
tradition of religious solidarity in which the upper
class has been born and bred for so many
generations has brought about sornfe very ignoble
results, which escape notice only because they are cus-
tomary. Many of the best educated people regard religion
as a matter of social practice. . . . There is a tendency for
the Conservative and the Imperialist, who are always
“ thinking in nationalities,” to strengthen national or
racial union by religious solidarity. At any rate, the
upper classes, who work the machine of Empire, are
expected to draw together in all matters of public observ-
ance. . . . The atmosphere of the public school instils in-
eradicably the notion that attendance at the Church
of England service is as much a matter of course as
loyalty to the British flag. Confirmation is taken in the
same spirit. I remember to have heard of a friend of
mine, who did not choose to be confirmed, interrogated by
the swell of the house in the following manner : “ Hallo,
Smith Kits, aren’t you going to be confirmed?” “No.”
“ Why not ? We’re all going to be. You always like being
eccentric. Everyone else is a Conservative, and you’re a
Liberal. Now we’re all going to be confirmed, and you won’t
join ! ” . . . There is an assumption that only the highly
educated can thrive without dogmatic religion, and that,
unless the upper classes set the example, the rest will, in
fact, cease to be professing Christians. There are rich
people who, in logical accordance with this view, seldom
attend church in London, where their presence, being un-
noticed by the masses, would be of no sort of use. But
in the country the same persons attend the village church,
where the presence of gentlefolk is noticed, and their
absence might be remarked.
In an interview published in a Sydney paper the
other day a landlord’s agent pleads :
My opinion is that country land values eannot advance
until the population is increased, and this is not likely to
be brought about until a wise scheme of ASSISTED
IMMIGRATION is inaugurated. WE SADLY WANT
POPULATION before we can hope to remove the stagna-
tion which exists in the property market. This refers
more particularly to country lands.
What the land agent asks for in the names of his
bosses, the landlords, is a socialistic scheme of assis-
ted immigration with a view to booming up land-
values. If the State raises a million or two by loan,
and spends it bringing immigrants to the country,
the most solid result will be that land values will
go up, and the landlords, will profit. Australia
has been through several experiences of the sort.
It raised money on loan, bought population with
part of it, and enhanced land values by making
railways with the rest. The land booms that fol-
lowed,; and their endings, are not yet forgotten.
What .The Bulletin looks forward to as one of
the good results of the stoppage of borrowing—
when that inevitable reform comes—is a re-
grading of land values on a more natural basis.
It is very largely the fictitious value put by the
landlords on the areas which they hold that keeps
population away. To buy more population with
a view to booming land values again is to treat a
cancer with irritants.

About- two years ago Westralia discovered that
mallee bark was part of its great natural resources,
and, imthe usual way, promptly started to tear it
down and sell it to German tanneries. The stuff
is shipped to Europe alongside thousands of hides :
and in a few months the tanned hides come back in
the shape of boots. Foreign vessels do all the carry-
ing, foreign labor does all the tanning, foreign
labor has all the bootmaking. Westralia’s share
in shoeing itself consists of peeling off the skin
from its cows and the bark from its trees. And
then its State Government talks of spending lots
of loan money in attracting population—to peel
off cow and tree skin. Meantime, as a guarantee
that it is perfectly satisfied to stay in the skin-
peeling stage of national existence, it sends only
three professed Protectionists out of 11 members
to the Federal Parliament.

“ Kiwi ” (Maoriland) has his say :
I am satisfied that while these young democracies
tolerate the Borrowing Curse, clean and healthy public
life will be impossible. I have often been at a loss to
account for the paradoxical fact that the greatest politi-
cal noodles hold the safest seats, while men above the
average in capacity cannot be reckoned as certainties t*
survive the ordeal of an election. The true explanation
is now clear to me, however ; it consists in the fact that
the noodles can always be relied on to give a solid vote to
the Government of the day, which in turn takes care to
see that constituencies which elect the noodles are well
greased. Here sundry of the aforesaid noodles have
been lately feasted by their grateful constituents,
and invariably a Minister (generally the übiquitous
Richard) was present. In the course of his speech the
Minister never once forgot to give his compliant sup-
porter, “ the member for the district,” a “ leg up,” and it
invariably took the form of an assurance that Mr.
Blank was a regular nuisance on account of the
way he pestered Ministers for roads and bridges.
Just the Pawn-Ticket.
A mysterious message was received by the police in the
small hours of this morning from the State Governor, who
is at Moss Vale, requesting the immediate despatch of
police representatives. The message created a marked
sensation in police quarters, and several detectives were
at once despatched to Moss Vale. —Sydney morning news-
papers, Jan. 30.
There are various speculations as to the mysterious
summoning of police and detective officers to Moss Vale.
Some surmise Russians. Some anarchists. Some hush-
rangers.— Purport of Sydney evening paper reports, Jan.
30 (first editions).
The police officers were summoned to Moss Vale to
escort down the bonds for the new N.S.W. loan. — Ditto
(later editions).
“ Headquarters of Police, our need is sore,
Send quickly your most trusty minions here.
God save the Right ! ” ’Tis said that ne’er before
The City Guards had shown a sign of fear.
“ Our Governor is menaced ! ” cried they all.
“ To arms, to arms ! ” and straightway breathing
vows
To save the liege, or to avenge his fall,
An iron-clad detachment left the house.
When morning inauspicious broke, the news
Flashed through the city on the wings of light,
And presently in mansions and in mews
All spoke the threat’nings of the dreadful night.
Ere breakfast time the startled people knew
They had been snared in some foul foreign plot,
From lip to lip the awful rumor flew,
A Russian spy had stolen—Lord knows what !
Some said our “plans,” and some his Ex’s, rings.
What odds? All damned the Russ. A story runs
That in the Zoo that day, the bears, poor things,
Looked vainly for their customary buns.
But when, in anguished waiting, hours had sped,
And still official silence mocked their sighs,
A whisper ran : “ Our Governor is dead—
Assassinated by two Russian spies.”
Then groans were heard, and curses deep and
loud,
And threats of vengeance, and a loyal rage
’Gainst all things Russian stirred the mighty
crowd ;
But at that fateful moment rose a sage.
“The Premier !” shrieked the mob. Pie smiled
and said,
“ Good fellow-borrowers, why all this fuss ?
Our gracious Governor’s dear sacred head
Has suffered nothing from the hated Russ.
“ He wired for the police this day, at dawn,
Because—at his abode among the thickets,
He had just signed to put the State in pawn
Once more (t’would never do to lose the tickets).
“ Two million bonds. You understand, I see.
Go then and tell your sisters and your brothers,
And witness bear, Reform, Economy,
Are still the patent watchwords of Carruthers ! ’*

Hoarse and beery applause generally followed this
declaration, and sometimes the audience rose and sang
“He’s a Jolly Good Fellow” while the blushing noodle
sat tight. Of course, all this is well displayed in the local
“ buster,” with the result that the next election is a fore-
gone conclusion. Party Government is, of course, to
blame to some extent for this disgraceful state of affairs,
but I doubt if it is more to be blamed than the plenitude
of borrowed boodle which Ministers have so long been
able to control.

The desire of Sydney City Council that
Sydney theatre proprietors should make their
theatres as safe as possible from a fire point of
view cannot be enforced without the co-operation
of the Government. The licensing of theatres is
in the hands of the Colonial Secretary, and he
alone can apply coercive measures. In reply to
recent suggestions from the City Council, the
owners of two theatres, the lloyal and the
Criterion, promptly carried out reforms. Now,
in the opinion of the M.F.B. and the city archi-
tect, the Criterion and Royal are the safest
theatres in Sydney. The proprietors of the
Lyceum and the Palace have so far done
nothing; but if, as is probable, the Lyceum
changes hands, reform will come with the new
landlord. The Palace calls for radical changes.
Its owners have established in the basement a
large electric lighting plant, which lights not only
the theatre, but also a number of other buildings
in the same block. There is also in the barement
a refrigerating plant, worked by the ammonia
process. Three large boilers are situated immedi-
ately beneath the entrance to the theatre, separated
from the pavement only by a foot of stone. In
the opinion of the City Council’s expert officers,
these boilers, and the other machinery connected,
in the basement of a theatre, constitute a public
danger. There should be no hesitation on the part
of the Colonial Secretary to back up the City
Council in enforcing any reasonable demands on
theatre-owners. The matter is too important to
be trifled with.

“Blind Man’s Buff” hasn’t the historical
interest of “Pretty Peggy,” though in every
other respect it is far ahead of the opening piece
of the Musgrove-Nellie Stewart season at the
Lyceum. The plot—it is melodrama pure and
simple—moves along in a rut worn deep by 2000
or so previous plays, but there is an unusual
amount of original character study in it. In
“Pretty Peggy” you got nothing but incidental
snapshots, mostly through a milliner’s shop-
window; in “Blind Man’s Buff” you meet
half-a-dozen interesting human types, elabor-
ately and on the whole very skilfully
worked out. You don’t get the average
of the type, certainly; still, if the villain’s
warts are all there, you don’t get any picture
painted all warts because the model happens to
have two or three. The rules of the game are fol-
lowed more strictly in regard to the heroine and
her mate. There isn’t, after all, such an ocean of
difference between the world’s good and bad. If
the bad have their warts, ‘the good have their
pimples at least. But here the good have none ;
Clyde Fitch hasn’t given Eleanor Carley and her
Boy in kharki one redeeming blotch, and therein
he fails to mirror Nature.

So Nellie Stewart’s part doesn’t grip you
like Hareourt Beatty’s does. You can’t feel that
it’s real. You don’t meet her outside ; you only
meet her when you go to see Bland Holt, or
William Anderson; and you know what she is
going to do every time. She is the copper plate
at the top of the copy book. But Sam Coast is a
study. You can’t help feeling a sort of pity for the
man—almost sympathy sometimes. He and his
father have made tons of money silver-mining out
West (it’s all ’Murikan). The old man is still
out there mining—not that he has to, but he’s
happier underground; there seems to him too
much room on top. The son is shrewd just so far
as the value of a shoot of ore goes, and has a vague
sort of idea that money buys everything.
He isn’t a brute about it. When he
sets out to smash the fortunes of Nellie
Stewart and her weak fool of a brother, and her
sister-in-law, and her mother, and everybody else
so as to get Nellie Stewart to marry him, you
don’t hate him. He is really in love with the
girl, and he is going to,make it all up to the
whole crowd when he gets her. He doesn’t even
want to buy her like the ordinary melodrama man
does. He wants her to love him and be real
happy. But he simply can’t understand how,
with everybody hard-up, and her fool-brother worse
than hard-up, she can do anything else but marry
him for a start anyhow. “Don’t you see you
must marry me ? ” he asks; and there’s pathos
in it. Clyde Fitch possibly goes too far once
or twice. It is doubtful whether this man would
trick the Boy in kharki, just leaving for the
Philippines, into believing that things were all
settled and that the Boy’s scone was dough so far
as Nellie Stewart was concerned. Still, there’s
room for two opinions about it. Sam Coast has
been on Wall-street since he came out of the West,
and it may have taught him some tricks of the
butter-trade. For all that, it didn’t sound just
right on opening night; the incident most
likely wouldn’t be there only it makes the
plot easier. Of course Coast doesn’t get the
girl. Kharki comes back from the Philippine
butchery with a broken arm, and the curtain falls
on the girl trying to get as close to the boy as the
splints will allow. It had to end that way, for
the copper-plate at the top of the copy-book is
always conventional.

“Blind Man’s Buff” is very evenly played.
Nellie Stewart is up to her usual level, and Mrs.
Maesmore Morris is above hers. Their frocks,
the bills, say, are from London and Paris.
As warm a “hand” as any on the first night
followed Nellie Stewart’s appearance, in the middle
of a scene, in a glittering ball-gown. The dress-
maker doesn’t often score to that extent. Miss
Watts Phillips furnished rare humor as a peri-
patetic hairdresser. Of Harcourt Beatty’s Sam
Coast enough has been said already to suggest
that it was an excellent character study. There
are others who deserve a word, especially the
youngsters who open the proceedings with a birth-
day-party scene; but “Blind Man’s Bluff” has
come to stay some weeks, and there’ll probably be
a chance yet.

The lady who is endeavoring in Paris to
establish the validity of a marriage made in 1886
with Frank Gardner at ’Frisco is Carrie Swain,
who about that date appeared in a series of tom-
boy plays at Sydney Criterion, with Gardner as
business manager. They coined money here, and
Gardner was later supposed to have made a big
rise in mining. However, they did not leave
Sydney until 1894 or thereabouts, and then
statedly with the purpose of giving the
lady’s fine singing voice a European training.
Last year the news came that Gardner had
married “a French baroness,” while Carrie Swain
was away in New York tending her sick mother.
Everyone in Australia believed that Carrie Swain
was Mrs. Gardner, and her conduct while
here would have defied the censorious inspection
of the Gimlet Club. Gardner started life as a
scene-shifter and stage-rouseabout in America.
He made his great fortune gambling, and no one
who ever saw him play a hand at poker (a revela-
tion in nerveless, cold-blooded sagacity) can be
surprised at his success upon the Stock Exchange.
He looked like Sitting Bull presiding at a burning
at the stake.

Indisposition on the part of Miss Bassian
has afforded Miss Dolly Castles the opportunity
of appearing as Josephine in “ Pinafore ” at Her
Majesty’s, Sydney. She has given a creditable
account of herself, but the music of the part is so
well suited to her voice that it would not have
been surprising had she made a greater hit.
Apparently she has not yet got over the nervous
stage of the inexperienced vocalist. She has also
shown over-anxiety as to the carrying capacity of
her voice. Consequently she has evinced a ten-
dency to sing sharp, especially in the scena & la
grand opera, “The hours creep on apace.” A
danger she must guard against, moreover, is
filling the role of a mere copyist. In her vocalisa-
tion as well as her action on the stage Miss
Castles has made too close a study of Miss
Bassian’s methods. She should aim at a style of
her own. “The Pirates of Penzance” will be
produced at Her Majesty’s next Saturday with a
strong cast.
** * *
At Sydney Royal the last nights of “A
Desperate Game ” are announced, and on Satur-
day Bland Holt will stage “ The Best of Friends,”
which is to be produced, it is promised, “on a
scale of magnificence,” and Holt usually, keeps
such promises. At Sydney Tivoli no new feature
calls for notice, but a very interesting programme
is nevertheless presented by friends of various
degrees of familiarity. The last nights of the
Marzella troup are announced.
* * *
At Sydney Agricultural Ground, on
Friday, Saturday, Monday and Tuesday, there
will be a display of fireworks by the firm
which showed the red light and the soaring
rocket to Sydney some months ago. At that
time The Bulletin was of opinion that the
rockets, Roman candles, Catherine wheels, mon-
keys, George Reids, &e., of the show were excel-
lent, but that the siege of Port Arthur was made
up too much of noise and too little of fireworks.
We are assured now that that has been changed
and the Port Arthur piece is on a par with the
best of the rockets. The show has also been
strengthened by the engagement of a high quality
concert co. to entertain the crowd between blazes.
* # *
‘ ‘ The Geisha ” fills in a week or two at Her
Majesty’s, Melb., and the familiar, puerile lyrics,
set to saccharine melodies, are being sung again.
Some of them are very puerile, also very long.
The “book,” apart from those narrative ballads,
is only moderately foolish, and by way of apology
for the weak-minded piece—if a musical comedy
can be called a “piece,” seeing that it is only a
collection of bits —the management stages a fine
array of Girl in a larger quantity of gaudy
over-garment than she ordinarily wears. But
the novelty of Japanese fans and fire-screen
figures has lost some of its early bloom,
and “The Geisha” is not nowadays a name
to conjure overflowing audiences with—in Mel-
bourne. The present cast is new in sundry
places. Haigh Jackson, Miss Clifton, the dimin-
utive W. S. Percy, Miss Ivy Scott and a sprightly
Miss who plays Juliette in a strictly non-Parisian
way, amount to an acceptable change of principals.
Bantock is a plump, oily successor to keen little
Hugh Ward who played the Marquis two years
ago. Lauri repeats his original Wun-hi, whilst
Miss Young for the second time warbles valuably
in the uncongenial character of an artless little
Mimosa San. Her Mimosa seems too strong a
cup of tea, and she should give it more milk and
sugar.
Saturday’s revival of “ Romeo and Juliet ”
at Melb. Princess’s is introduced to a confiding
public in the same deceptive light as usual. It is
called Shakspeare’s Famous Love Tragedy, rather
than William’s Amusing Satire. There are five
violent deaths and many yards of mental anguish
in “Romeo and Juliet” —gloom enough for two
tragedies—nevertheless, the story must have been
intended as a wholesome tonic for the eternal
Romeo of real life, the perennial self-deceiver, the
writhing love-sick worm that never dieth. Romeo
of Verona had cruel luck. Hopelessly in love, as
he supposed, with a certain Rosaline, he let
himself be dragged by his pal Ben (volio)
to an evening party where Rosaline was to be
on view in fair and open competition with other
girls. He thought his first mad infatuation would
remain unshaken —but lo ! it passed away like a
ridiculous nightmare the moment he met Juliet.
He was cured of Rosaline ere he had time to look
for her. The play forgets even to mention
whether Rosaline was really present at the soiree
or not. It just shows how easily a young man
may leap from the frying-pan of unrequited affec-
tion into the fire of mutual love, and then it
rushes Romeo and his girl along a route
of unlucky family difficulties to an evil-smelling
sepulchre. A pungent satire gets drowned in a
sea of blood. One forgets Rosaline. She ought
to be the most remembered young person in
British classic drama. The possibilities attaching
to Rosaline are more humanly natural than any-
thing that happens in the play. Had Romeo
escaped the worst Shaksperian consequences of
his love, and settled down into matter-of-fact
matrimony, somebody would have been certain to
have told Juliet about the girl her husband couldn’t
get, and then .
* * * *
The performance at the Princess’s is the
same that was given in Sydney a few weeks ago—
with one important exception. Mrs. Walter Hill
now appears to advantage as the Nurse, the sort
of Nurse who would have no scruples in advising
Juliet to commit bigamy for the sake of peace and
quietness. Roy Redgrave (why that penny-
novelette name ?) is again a breezy Mercutio, and
Greenaway, although somewhat loud and rough-
edged, fills the Romeo part more satisfactorily
than when he looked pretty in it, years ago.
There are some raw spots in the cast
(Paris is very raw), and the general treat-
ment of the play seems weak in the upper regis-
ter of poetic effect. Miss Tittell Brune—bright
and winsome through the first two acts and
powerful in the potion scene—-is the youngest and
most convincing Juliet that Melbourne has seen
since Essie Jenj ns won the affections of the town.
But her art is not consistently picturesque, not
quite fascinating all the time. “Romeo and
J uliet ” on Saturday promised to be a draw for at
least a fortnight if required. The season will
close shortly, and there is “Theodora” to come
along meanwhile.
* & * *
At the Bijou there is only a mild demand
for the story of the young hero whose wife bids
him go and look for work, so a revival of “East
Lyne” has been billed for Saturday. “East
Lynne,” on the sacred word of the advt., is “full
of grace and perfume.” It likewise contains much
woe and Little Willie, and in this instance the
Great Railway Smash will be staged with every
attention to detail.
* * * *
Hackenschmidt continues his triumphant
feats of wrestle, at the Opera House, in addition
to posing his massive proportions on a pedestal.
Carden Wilson gives a new assortment of imita-
tions of actors, also the Frasettis and Gregson-
cum-Goodfellow have changed their “turns,” and
Ada Delroy plus James Bell is back again after a
prolonged absence. The return of these last-
named wanderers was a matter for general applause
on Saturday. At the Royal the usual eight rounds
of panto will be fired off this week, which is the
sth of the series. One of these weeks “ Sin bad ”
will go the way of all pantos, but up to Saturday
last the evidences of approaching dissolution were
barely perceptible. The Cafe Chantant and the
Chutes and things are proceeding prosperously at
I mice s Court, where a Toboggan struggle falls
due next Wednesday.

The man from Manchuria—otherwise Cap-
tain Scott-Harden—will tell his illustrated story
of Russo-Jap bloodshed at Melb. Athenaeum
Hall to-night (Thursday). Edwin Geaeh, in
announcing the advent of the gentleman with the
gory narrative, has had the awful ingratitude to
denounce war as a cruel, heartless performance.
This from the Geach who lead Donald Macdonald
around the country. War is a blessed source of
profit for the correspondent armed with a lecture
and the business manager who shudders at his
revelations.

“ Lerli ” ; What I saw and heard of opera
in Paris was enough to show that both
Musgrove and Williamson, with their respec-
tive opera companies, treated us very well in
Australia. Heard “La Boheme” at the Opera
Comique. On the whole, I enjoyed the recent
Melbourne performance more than the one in Paris.
In music in general Paris seems to be behind.
There are very few concerts, and not much of the
really classical music is performed. In London
you can get Beethoven, Wagner, and all the rest
of them almost every day. The French people
seem to like light, sparkling music. They have
all the English musical-comedy music. For
instance, I heard the “Toreador” at the Moulin-
Rouge. They have also had “Florodora,” &c.
They like the tune of the cake-walk, and the
dance itself created a perfect furore. But for
music that is really music, the Parisians are not
very keen. Yet when you come to consider the
non-tnusical theatre, and study French drama
fund French acting, you have to admit the pre-
eminence of the French stage.

At Adelaide Tivoli an unkind travelling
co. has put up “Uncle Tom’s Cabin’’—unkind
because the Dampier co. at the Royal, having
worked through “Robbery Under Arms” and
“His Natural Life,” down to “East Lynne,”
might have been expected to worry Little Eva
next. Hales has come back and given a fare-
well lecture on the war, with pictures of great
bloodthirstiness ; and a timely Continental gave a
chance to Hilda Felstead and Frank Robertson,
two more Adelaide singers about to try their luck
in Europe.
FICKLE ROMEO.
Romeo romantic
Loved a Rosaline.
Passion—grand, gigantic—
Drove him nearly frantic :
Romeo romantic
Deemed the maid divine :
Pleaded, ogled vainly,
Sighed and wept insanely.
Days and nights were mainly
Dreams of Rosaline.
Romeo, dejected,
Met Miss Capulet,
Charming, unaffected,
Rich and well-connected ;
Romeo, dejected,
Sighed for Ju-li-et.
Damsel indiscreetly
Met his glances sweetly ;
He was gone completely
On Miss Capulet.
Romeo in fiction
Shows each boy (and girl)
How to cure affliction
Born of false conviction.
In a haze of fiction
Brains of lovers whirl.
If your goddess frown, boys,
Don’t be flattened down, boys,
Look around the town, boys.
Find a newer girl.

The bank has now done what it should have done long
ago and reduced its dividend. Its balance-sheets have
long been under a suspicion which the present develop-
ment only deepens. Profits are alleged to have declined
by nearly one-third ; yet there is nothing to indicate why
it should be so. On the contrary, comparing the present
balance-sheet with that of 12 months ago, the past half-
year should have been the more prosperous. According
to the sworn averages, the bank was paying interest on
£532,687 in the December quarter of 1903, and on only
£505,617 in the December quarter of 1904. Advances
have, however, kept almost stationary. Coin, &e., the
non-profit-earning part of the assets, has decreased from
£383,004 to £239,850. Yet the profit is supposed to have
fallen from £9052 to £6158. It may be that the present
alleged profit is real profit, but in that case the former
£9052 looks unreal. Total liabilities to the public amount
to £1,149,700; liquid assets reach £289,851, or 25£ per
cent, of liabilities. With 75 per cent, of the public’s
money working, earnings should have been rather
high ; as a matter of fact, they amounted to only
£3 os. Bd. per cent, per annum on shareholders’
funds. It looks as though securities ought to be
again overhauled. The paid-up capital is £400,000;
and there is a reserve liability of £540,000. Even without
the latter, however, depositors seem very well secured,
since the total liabilities to the public are only'about
three times the paid capital.

In the matter of the winding-up of the Assets Trust’s
affairs, this progress has been made :

Liabilities of Trust .. £3,334,903 £3,058,888 £3,008,996

Net Deficit .. .. £1,507,284 £1,179,096 £1,181,537
In three years, the net deficit has been reduced by
£325,747 ; but £150,000 of this reduction has been the
result of forfeiture of capital. The remaining deficit is
being liquidated out of profits. The stated amount of the
deficit is, of course, an estimate, and depends upon the
valuation of the assets. As to that, it is to be noted that,
while the trust’s liabilities have been reduced by £325,907
in three years, the assets have been reduced by only
£lBO,OOO. But the realisation isn’t proceeding at that
rate. In the past 12 months, while liabilities have been
reduced by £49,892, assets have been reduced by £55,000,
which leaves a balance on the wrong side. The share-
holders’ position is something like this :
Capital (as written down) .. £2,212,624
Net Deficit as above .. .. 1,181,537
Shareholders’ Funds Intact.. £1,031,087
The ordinary capital remaining is £95,274 ; £2,300,000 has
been written off, in addition to the forfeitures. The
shareholders’ position has been bad enough, and much
way has still to be made up ; but the depositor is secured
beyond the ordinary possibility of disaster. The assets of
the trust may still be- overvalued, in spite of frequent
overhauls, but they would have to be overvalued by
upwards of 60 per cent, to imperil the depositors’ posi-
tion, assuming that the bank’s new business is good. As
to this business, profits are not high, mainly because of
the very large holding of coin and liquid assets, together
totalling' 51 p.c. of liabilities to the public, including
“ A ” deposits, but excluding the £3,008,996 of Trust
liabilities, which are fixed till 1916. Coin, bullion. &e.,
stand for 25 p.c. Profits, after appropriations to aid the
Trust, have been as follows recently

Compared with 12 months ago, deposits have increased
from £3,059,837 to £3,358,617, the principal increase being
in non-interest bearing deposits, which stand at £1,719,390
—an unusually high figure, which makes a high coin
holding prudent. Advances have increased from £3,654,210
to £3,859,354. The movements are satisfactory, and
should mean sustained profits.,

Profit is always shown after reducing premises account
and providing for bad and doubtful debts ; and as it is
fairly clear that these items are used to come and go on,
the actual value of any particular term’s business is most
likely not disclosed. In an unusually good half-year the
writings down are heavy ; in a poor'half, they are light.
Nevertheless, the figures no doubt show the trend of
profits. The position can be to some extent tested this
way. Ten years ago, on the average amount of ail assets,
the disclosed profit was at the rate of 11s. sd. per cent,
per annum ; on the same basis it is now 18s. Id. per cent.
This is fair proof that there has been extensive writing
down, and that the accounts are generally much more
productive than they were 10 years back. It is still a
good way, however, from the highest Australian rate.
The profits, as shown, were last half-year at the rate of
£6 6s. 4d. per cent, per annum on capital (£1,000,000)
and reserves ; recent figures on same basis

These movements certainly don’t, in ordinary circum-
stances, mean increasing profits. There is an increase of
over half-a-million in the non-profit earning coin and
bullion, while presumably some of the extra deposits are
interest-bearing. (The average of interest-bearing deposits
in the last quarter was £5,814,900, as against £5,647,847
in the corresponding quarter, 1903.) The position from
a depositor’s point of view is unusually strong, nearly
45 per cent, of all liabilities to the public being- repre-
sented by liquid assets ; over 21 per cent, of liabilities is
represented by coin and bullion.

Considering that it has the use of only about 295. of
deposits for every £1 of its own capital, this bank makes
remarkably fine profits, thanks largely to the concentra-
tion of its business. On the basis of capital (£85,000) and
reserves, profits per cent, per annum lately have been :—■

The movements in the 12 months have been very slight.
Deposits at interest have advanced from £179,776 to
£184,940 ; but deposits not bearing interest have gone
back from £43,216 to £39,469, about equalising matters.
The advances have been reduced from £306,102 to £297,632,
and the available money has gone a little into real estate,
but mostly into presumably unproductive coin and cash
balances. The bank has 34 p.c. of all liabilities to the
public in liquid assets ; but, having only one office, it is
in a much stronger position than some banks with a
larger proportion of those reserves.
The Australian Deposit and Mortgage Bank,
whose balance-sheet figures have for years been very
questionable, is at last making an effort to do the right
thing. The terms of reconstruction are not quite settled,
but nearly so. This is approximately the position
Afc Present. Proposed.

The ordinary-share interest remaining will thus be only
nominal; it could not, however, be cancelled outright.
The last balance-sheet showed :
Debts due (taken over).. .. £806,348
Foreclosed properties .. .. 310,915
£1,117,263
There have apparently been some transactions since them
for the valuators have revalued only properties stand"
ing in the books at £1,013,100, which they have
revalued at £329,813 ; the shortage will absorb £683,287
of the capital written off, leaving £45,941. But
there are also such items as—Balances of purchase money,
£45,915 ; bank premises at cost as taken over at recon-
struction, £66,000 ; shares in other co.’s at cost, £1668; and
these will no doubt call for some attention. On the new
capital (£199,029) the average disclosed profits for the
past two years would show only £2 Bs. 6d. per cent, per
annum ; so it seems that the writing-down isn’t as
thorough as it might be. The trouble is that about half
of the old securities and the foreclosed estates are vacant
lands, from which the interest return is very small, what-
ever the capital or speculative value may be. For some
time past the £5 pref. shares have been getting 1 per
cent., though usually it hasn’t been earned ; it doesn’t
look now as though the 30s. shares can safely rely upon
more than 2 per cent. Anyhow, certainly no more should
be paid until prospects improve very much. The bank is
handicapped through having - only a very small amount of
deposit money which doesn’t carry interest, and it isn’t
likely to get much more till it has strengthened its
position by exercising some more self-denial.

This is the best profit since things went wrong, and it
isn’t much behind the largely fictitious profits of the
drunk days. Things are supposed to be shockingly bad
in Queensland, yet, helped no doubt by one or two extra
good seasons, the banks are picking up. On the basis of
capital and reserves, the half-year’s profit was at the rate
of £3 13s. sd. per, cent, per annum—still not high, but
better than-it was a while ago. Recent figures :
Dec.,’oo £3 17 9 June,’o2 £3 17 0 Dec.,’o3 £3 13 0

Dec., ’Ol 319 6 June, ’O3 3 10 2 Dec., ’O4 3 13 6
The low rate of profits is, however, largely due to the
very small amount of deposits of which the bank has the
use. The Commercial of Sydney has about £5 10s. of de-
posits for every £1 of shareholders’ funds, notwithstanding
its very large reserves ; the Royal of Queensland has very
little more than £1 10s. for every £l. Still, Queensland
banks had formerly such a cruel time that they make ad-
vances now with apparently great caution, and, therefore,
don’t push the deposit business. Nevertheless, the Royal’s
deposits are increasing

The good season probably accounts for the slightly re-
duced advances, while the slump at the Towers and
Gympie, and the withdrawal of money from mining
share-gambling, may account for the increased deposits.
The movement, however, seems to mean less banking pro-
fits. Of the increased liquid assets £72,450 is represented
by coin and bullion, the holding of which is excessive—
nearly 29 per cent, of total liabilities to the public, while
all liquid assets exceed 41 per cent, of the liabilities.
Evidently the bank is in a position to meet a consider-
ably increased demand for capital. And that, it is worth
recalling and remembering, was just what happened 12
or 15 years ago, when the Queensland bank manager used
to be sent out on expeditions to find somebody who
would borrow a quarter of a million or so. He generally
found somebody. The trouble was that a little later he
couldn’t find the quarter-million.

Of the half-year’s profit £6999 shows in the profit and
loss £2500 as additions to the reserve for special
repairs and new steamers, and £2OOO as additions to the
insurance reserve. The former reserve stands now at
£14,500 ; insurance reserve, £5500 ; and undivided profit,
£568. These reserves might be in the nature of writings-
off; in other words, a co. might, instead of writing
off, put the allowance for depreciation into some
such accounts as these. The highly - profitable
Sydney Ferries, however, doesn’t need to adopt that
doubtful plan ; it evidently writes down its pro-
perties severely in addition to making these appro-
priations. The extent of these writings-down is not
disclosed; but twelve months ago ship property was
taken in at £58,260, while now, notwithstanding additions
to the fleet meantime, it is in at only £57,717. No doubt
there are risks in the business ; yet, up to now, so exceed-
ingly profitable is it, and the assets appear to have been
written down so hard, that the annual return on the
whole assets is about 14 per cent. And practioally the
whole assets are represented by shareholders’ funds, for
the co. owes only a few hundreds, and it works absolutely
on its own money.

But in addition to the reserves shown above there are
Suspense accounts ,£216,631. and meter reserve £6903.
The former mav be wholly or partly a reserve, and the
atter is in the nature of a reserve. The directors shrink
from giving shareholders and the public any information.
Formerly it used to be set out that these suspense
accounts included premium capital; but even that scrap
of information has now been suppressed. The capital is
£750,000 ; on that and reserves shown in the table, the
return was at the glittering- rate of £l4 4s. Bd. p.c. p.a.
But if the suspense (premium capital, &c.) and meter
account are reckoned as reserves, the return was £ll Os.
4d. p.c.—remarkable figures, whichever are taken. The
latter rate cannot, however, be put forward as an absolute
thing, because it isn’t known whether the whole of this
suspense account is a true reserve or not; nevertheless
this rate (£ll 6s. 4d.) seems to be the best for comparison
with the Melbourne co.’s £7 Is. In addition to its own
capital and funds, the co. owes in debentures, loans, and
sundry creditors £517,399 (all bunched, as usual), and to
extend its business it proposes to raise another £200,000,
of which £lOO,OOO will be premium capital, to be, pre-
sumably, cast into the unsatisfactory “ suspense
accounts ” item with the rest. On the average assets the
return is at the rate of £7 Bs. p.c., after paying interest on
debentures and allowing for bad debts, &c. ; and no doubt
a concern which gives that sort of result feels justified
in saying as little about its proceedings as possible.

Dec.,’oo. Dec.,’o3 June,’o4. Dec.,’o4.
Reserve Fund ..£75,163 £87,812 £87,911 £78,618
Premium Capital 466,535 466,535 466,535 466,535

Undivided Profit 13,098 3,663 3,060 2,926
The formal reserve fund has been reduced through the
heavy call on the co. for the new works (including pur-
chased works). Except £50,000, which is in the co.’s own
debentures, the whole of the reserves are represented
directly by plant, &c. As to the value of this investment:
The whole expenditure on capital account has amounted
to £2,149,842, and the earnings on this were at the rate of
£6 14s. 6d. per cent, per annum. A considerable amount
has been spent on works out of revenue, and if this were
included, the return would, of course, be reduced ; still,
with some allowance on that account, the return is so large
that there isn’t much inducement to put the reserve funds
into any other investment. In other words, the Metro-
politan Gas Co.’s monopoly is so good that it pays it
better to use its money in its own business rather than in
anybody else’s business. On capital and reserves its
profits (after paying interest on debentures and writing
off £1434) were, last half-year, at the rate of £7 Is. per
cent, per annum. The difference between that and the
rate previously quoted on the entire capital outlay ap-
proximately represents the profit made for the co. by the
debenture capital.

General manager Courtney, of the Sulphide
Corporation, Broken Hill, has always hankered after
a process that would sort out the three metals
from the crude ore in one process after prelimin-
ary crushing. One time it was thought mag-
netic concentration would do it; and, though it
will, as will also a dozen other processes, it is still
found more economical to run the ore through the ordi-
nary water-dressing mill to take out the bulk of the silver
and lead, and give only the residue to the magnetics.
Now, however, the co. thinks it has got hold of something
valuable in a flotation process, and a small plant, running
to about 100 tons a day, is to go up. But Broken Hill has
almost given up hoping for any complete single-process
solution of its sulphide problem. Everything of much
value so far has been a matter of slow evolution, and the
most loudly advertised solutions have been about the
worst failures. Even as to the acid process, announced
12 months ago with much trumpeting, the B.H. Prop, is
simply groping its way through difficulties. It is, how-
ever, fair to the responsible officers to say that they
didn’t do the trumpeting.
Interesting to follow the sulphide ore from mine
to market, and note the losses. Sulphide Corporation
figures are best for the purpose. Ore is worth from that
mine ll'9oz. silver, 17 p.c. lead, and 18'5 p.c. zinc. The
recovery in the concentration mill was 47'9 p.c. of the
silver and 68’3 p.c, of the lead. Approximately, the
position last year was :
Silver. Lead. Zinc.
Recovered in concentrates £133,610 £280,452 Nil.
Left in “ tailings,” etc .. 145,188 130,320 £736,780
Zinc lost 85,514
The zinc referred to as lost is in the silver-lead concen-
trates ; it shouldn’t be there, and is more harm than
good. Some portion of the silver and lead is also lost in
smelting, but co.’s smother these figures—they have to
sell some of their concentrates, and it isn’t well to let the
buyers know the lowest point at which the co.’s can
themselves profitably smelt. Then as to the “ tailings,”
&c. A little (slimes mostly) is sent to the smelters. The
rest, when handled at all, is dressed. The stuff treated
averages 9'6oz. silver, B‘4 p.c. lead, and 27'2 p.c. zinc ;
the lower-grade “ tailings ” are so far left untouched. Of
this metal, 74-8 p.c. of the silver, 77 p.c. of the lead, and
73'5 p.c. of the zinc are recovered as “ zincs.” Following
is the result from the 44,093 tons treated last year:—
Silver. Lead. Zinc.
In “zincs” .. .. £37,038 £34,212 £193,600
Lost 12,346 10,224 68,310
And, notwithstanding the heavy losses shown here, the
“middlings,” &c., operated on were, no doubt, the part
of the “ tailings ” most suitable for this process. But the
losses are not yet over. The co. sent 1624 J tons of the
“zincs” for treatment at the distilling plant. These
would contain (if of the average quality turned out from
the magnetic mill) 22,4000 z. silver, 200 tons lead, and 627
tons zinc. The result was :
Silver. Lead. Zinc.
Metallic zinc £6490
In Residues £2407 £2124
Lost 206 276 7304
Total zinc won, £6490; metals in residues (of which some
proportion will be lost in subsequent treatment), £4531 ;
metals lost, £7786. Thus in the first process (ordinary
concentration) there is a loss of zinc, equal to about 5J p.c.
of the gross value of the ore. In the second process
(magnetic concentration) there is a loss equal to 25 - 5 p.c.
of what is left. In the smelting of the “zincs ” from the
magnetic concentrators there is a loss of 41 "3 p.c. of the
metals, assuming only average-value “zincs” were sup-
plied to the co.’s own works. And there would be a
further loss in the treatment of the residues, which
are reckoned here as saved. That’s as far as a co., which
is always ready to buy brains and pay well for them, has
got so far in sulphide-treatment. No wonder the co.’s
hanker after a direct process.

B.H. North is making a profit of £2600 per
month, on the basis of last two months’ work. This is
equal to an eighteenpenny dividend per quarter—6s. a
year. Lead and silver have lately been above the average
of the last three years’ prices, which advantage must be
put against the fact that the mill hasn’t been working
at full capacity, simply because the ore can’t be got out of
the mine fast enough. There is enough ore there (say 4j
years’ supply proved, with the mill running full time), but
it can’t be got away, and the necessary refilling done with
the present shaft, &c. Junction, some years ago, found
itself in a somewhat similar fix, so it let refilling slide in
order to keep the shaft, &c., open for ore ; and the smash
that followed has left the mine crippled still. North’s
new manager (Weir) is doing excellent work at the mill —
as good as any at Broken Hill, though it isn’t much use
comparing metal recoveries, because the ores vary so, and
the North’s has always been a good concentrating ore.
The costs, including Is. 4d. per ton for development, were
15s. 7Jd. per ton of ore. Sulphide Corporation’s is 16s. 61d.
per ton, but that includes 2s. 3d. spent on construction
accounts. South’s costs are 14s. o£d. Considering com-
parative extent of operations, North’s work is good, even
when it is remembered that it had been doing only de-
velopment work for some time past, which would natu-
rally' reduce present working expenses. Co. had a surplus
of £4572 of liquid assets over liabilities on Dec. 31st, of
which over £4OOO was cash.
B.H. Junction has restarted ; its mill is ready
Now it needs to find some more ore.

Young Australia, Cobar, is suffering from a
surfeit of unpaid calls —concern hasn’t had shareholders'

Next to the True Blue and Neeld’s, most pro
lific claim at Wyalong (N.S. VV.) for past year was th
Barrier, which treated 344 tons for 13720 z. gold" while 1!)
tons battery stone gave some 2500 z round a little ove
3oz. per ton. Something was also realised from concen
trates and tailings. True Blue is now held by E. E. Tyler
on behalf of an English syndicate and appears to be
recouping the owners for their large outlay on other
properties, such as the Klondyke and Brilliant. Tyler
has re-started the latter, which has a good position between
True Blue and Neeld’s.

Birthday Tunnel, Berringa (Vic.), went through
the last half-year crushing 4dwt. dirt, and made a profit
of £l7OO, of which £lOOO was promptly paid out as divs.
To date co. has won gold worth £71,847 and sold pyrites
worth £1474, and has paid £23,000 in divs. This is not a
bad record, and, as working costs are kept down to 12s.
or 135., there is a prospect of a dividend now and again.
Only good bit of stone met with of late is a short shoot at
No. 5 (bottom) level, but it petered out in Bft. Considering
the way in which shares were boosted when a bit of good
stone was available, it is as well that the opportunity for a
second jig was not forthcoming. A change in directors was
made at the meeting of the co., Thompson being suc-
ceeded by George Buchanan, share broker. Therefore,
once again a typical Ballarat board runs the show. And
that isn’t promising.

Way in which directors of Glenfine South, Pit-
field (Vic.), dodge committing themselves over prospects
of deep alluvial ground indicates the old warhorse. T.
Rickards, a previous manager, is said to “consider it
to be payable.” Rickards might put on his think-
ing-cap, if ever he did say such a thing, and ask
himself if he ever got seriously into the deep ground.
The impression outside was that no sooner was he
100 ft. past the rim-rock than things went wrong,
and work had to be abandoned. That was in Alcock’s
days. Co. is now rising from a lower westerly level to
reach the deep ground. Whether the wash is payable
will be proved by present work, and not by any statement
ascribed to old ex-officials. The enterprise, if successful,
means a revival in Pitfield mining. Co. is grubbing about
in upper level for gold-bearing quartz, when it would do
better to sink.

Economical Gold Mining.—Low grade ores
and high cost in fuel and wages have made it imperative
that managers and engineers should reconstruct upon
more economical lines. Heretofore the boiler plant was
given little consideration, but the introduction of the
Hornsby “upright” water tube boiler having demons-
trated great economy, and with safety under indifferent
conditions of feed water, it is now superseding other types.
In W.A. these boilers are worked with an economy not
heretofore known on those fields, and in Queensland over
2500 h.p. is oh order for the Mount Morgan Gold Mining
Co. It is cleaned in one fourth the time of other boilers
and has no tube troubles. Boilers may be seen in opera-
tion in Sydney and Melbourne. R. Hornsby and Sons,

The Babcock Boiler seems to be favored by
mining engineers, over 50 mines in Australia using these
boilers. Mount Morgan has 20, Waihi Gold Mining- Co.
24, Mount Lyell 12, Tasmanian Gold Mining Company 7,
and at Broken Hill there are 30 distributed amongst the
mines, water works, and electric supply, while in
Western Australia they are looked upon as a necessity,
there being now 68 in the principal mines and Kalgoorlie
Water Supply. It will be noted that coal is expensive at
Broken Hill, and wood fuel is expensive at W.A. These
figures speak for themselves. Evidently the ease of
transportation, the economy in fuel and maintenance and
the adaptability to any class of fuel, that are such con-
spicuous points in the Babcock Boiler, are much
appreciated in Australian mines.*

Australian liquor is not a thing to be
fooled with. The other day a man was cleaning
out an Australian wine cask with sulphur fumes
when an explosion shattered the barrel to frag-
ments and broke his leg. Same day a boy dropped
a match into a decanter of spirit, and in a second
he was as dead as if it had been dynamite.
Sixteen hundred people had a lively New
Year’s Day on the Union liner Mararoa, which
ran a “grand sea excursion” from Petone to
Picton (M.L.) that day. As soon as the crowded
boat got outside Petone Harbor it ran into a heavy
sea, and the wind freshened to a gale. The deck
was awash, and lively excursionists floated round
as they wished one another the compliments of the
season. One woman had a leg smashed, and
others had all sorts of fancy cuts and bruises.
There was heaps of accommodation below, where
the crowd might have got some protection from
the gale ; but it was against the rules to let “ mere
5-bob excursionists ” into the cabins, social hall,
or other portions of the tossing premises; and
even 1600 people washing around on the deck in a
gale weren’t enough to break through the sacred
rules. The question is whether any steamship
co. ought to be allowed to take people out to sea
if it isn’t prepared to offer below-deck accommo-
dation in case of winds and waves misbehaving.
AFTER THE ATTACK.
HE (anxious to ingratiate himself): “My dear
young lady, the wretched dog is not mine,
you know.”
SHE (tartly): “I beg your pardon. I was misled
by the resemblance.”
The husband of a lady who, with her
daughters, keeps a girls’ seminary in Melbourne,
was before the court the other day. Evidence
given alleged that he was in the habit of dropping
around written epigrams on marriage where the
girls could find them. The gem about which he
prided himself most was “ The married man has
two happy days—the day he marries and the day
his wife dies.” And in this the rude cynic wasn’t
even original: he merely mangled a sneer by the
Greek Palladas—
Woman is ever a vexation. But two good hours she has—
The one on her bridal couch : the other on her bier.
The Broken Hill S INI. has been distin-
guishing himself again. He had two vicious
persons in front of him the other day—one aged
six, the other seven. He discharged the six-year-
old desperado, “as being under the age of a
criminal offence ” (the crime was stealing six-
pean’orth of peaches), but the other hardened and
mature criminal of seven he sentenced to gaol for
11 days unless he happened to have 20s. fine with
costs about nim. Apart from the cruelty of the
punishment, the case is interesting as apparently
laying down the law that somewhere between six
and seven the young Australian steps into the re-
sponsibilities of citizenship. The Attorney-General
has been busy worrying this magistrate to explain
what he meant by lately making some vague
remarks to the effect that even he hadn’t been
consulted before the Broken Hill Circuit Court
was shut. The Attorney-General might now do
worse than ask for another explanation. On the
face of it, it looks as though Broken Hill needs
to worry more about its Police Court than its
Circuit Court.

Daring the weary months of the siege of
Port Arthur the newspapers frequently held up
Stoessel as a melodramatic miscreant, sacrificing
human lives in the interest of personal gaud and
fame. Now, at the capitulation, the insult of
“ Coward ! ” is hurled at the man who made Japan
pay so dearly for hauling down the white man’s
nag, and it is alleged that the beleaguered garri-
son should have held out for a longer spell.
Because there was no futile bayonet-stand under
the last wall the blood-gorged press affects sur-
prise and indignation. Yet S.toessel’s wonderful
resistance cost Japan the flower of its troops, and
if he had received a tithe of the support accorded
to Nogi, the Monkey would have sworn off corner-
ing Bears in future.

The other day there retired from the
New South Wales prison service an ancient who
had been watching over prisoners for many, many
years. In responding to a farewell speech made
by the gaoler, the old turnkey remarked with deep
emotion that he thanked the Lord for His goodness
to him, for during all his years he had never let a
prisoner escape ! The Lord gets some curious
prayers.

Hobart has a public library, and the insti-
tution came in for a dole of Carnegie’s sweat-
stained money. The library is a quaint little
show, typical of the towniet. It closes at 11.30
every day, and does not open on Sundays. Also,
it shuts the doors for an indefinite period—a
month or so—every year, while the shelves are
dusted and the flies fished out of the ink. This
generally happens about show-time, when the town
is full of country-folk. Perhaps the Carnegie
money, moist with the blood and sweat of the
Pittsburg workers, will also reek a little of Yankee
hustle and waken up the sleepy institution.
A case of distress in a city slum recently
coming under the notice of the charitable, the
services of a doctor and trained nurse were
secured. Things were soon set right. The cheery
little nurse bought a broom and vanquished the
dirt of generations, put some flowers on the table,
tucked the sick mother and the new baby in com-
fortably for the night, bought a new kettle and
left it singing on the newly-polished stove, and
admonished the inmates as to what they were to
do pending her visit next day. She left her for-
gotten purse on the dresser. Next day she found
that all but the baby had enjoyed a gay old
“drunk” on the contents of the purse, winding
up with a “ refresher,” got by pawning the kettle.
Dr. Norris, of Melb. Board of Health, to
the Butter Commission on “preservatives” :
In milk there are hosts of germs that may grow—some
produce sourness, others produce putrefaction, others
break up the fat and give rise to fatty acids. Boric acid
retards the growth of the germs which produce sourness,
the only indication the housewife has that the milk is
stale. It apparently remains sweet, while all the time it
is degenerating and becoming putrid. Boric acid merely
keeps fhe milk in a marketable, not in a healthy, con-
dition.
That is, it is only used because it masks putre-
faction, disease and danger to life.
Latest’Murikan religion hails from Chicago,
calls itself .“the Pentecostal Dancers,” and is
essentially corybantic in its worship. The cake-
walk, the barn-dance, the break-down, and the
double shuffle are saving instruments of Grace in
the eyes of these folk, who have just held a
“mission” in London, and threaten to come to
Australia this year. They do their dancing en-
thusiastically, epileptically, not in the deadly
solemn fashion of the Australian larrikin, which
makNi a “push” picnic so much like a funeral cere-
mony. Provided the deaconesses are as stalwart
in limb as in faith, there should be a welcome for
the faith in this country.
The anti-beer argument in Maoriland
threatens to unhinge weak minds to as great an
extent as over-indulgence asylumises the
heavy “tank.” Down south lately a
man had to be placed under restraint
because he fancied that he was a lemon-
ade bottle that had lost its marble ; and
a youth up at Mangukaramea, who had
gorged himself with Prohibition litera-
ture, has been making things lively in
the b ickblocks, where they get little ex-
citement, by giving “inspired” ad-
dresses. He turned up on a horse at
one sinful centre, addressed a big crowd,
and declared that faith would remove
mountains, and other balderdash, which
is the stock-in-trade of the wall-eyed and
the wall-minded. But the police shooed
him away before he had time to even
mention a collection, so he took steamer
to Auckland to close up all the pubs.
There, apparently, he has produced no
results. Faith may be able to remove
mountains, but apparently no one has
enough of it, and mountains remain at
the old address.
Brisbane’s desperately hard-up hospitals
will get a solid lift from a scheme which has been
set moving there ; the employees of most of the
large firms have agreed to allow of the deduction
of Id per week for these charities. The Broken
Hill Hospital was lifted to affluence in much the
same way ; only there the mining co.’s subsidised
the men’s Ad. in the £, and the State subsidised
the lot. Then the Truck Act came along, and the
co.’s, which had got tired of paying their subsidy,
rushed it and said it prevented any further
ha’penny deduction. That excuse was promptly
knocked out by an amending Act; but it didn’t
make any difference, for the co.’s never took the
business up again. The Miners’ Accident Insur-
ance scheme would go the same way only that the
law has tied the co.’s down tight to it.

“The Prooshan ” tells how he goes to
sleep :
Let the insomaniac rub the temples gently with the
first and second fingers of the right hand. The right arm
must be supported on a pillow. The rubbing produces a
noise like “ A- woosh ! A-woosh!” and gradually all
thought is centred on the fingers and the rub and its
music, and sleep ensues. I have proved the efficacy of
this scores of times.
Australia’s sympathy with Japan is getting
to be of such a pallid quality that the cable liar has
thought it fit to send through a _ message that
young girls are being luiouted in the streets
of Russia. This is the sort of thing that is
eternally served up to English asses, just as the
Continental clown is taught that the British man
is accustomed to put a halter round his wife’s neck
and sell her at Smithfield. The average English-
man gets his ideas of Russia from the melo-
dramatic stage, in which, when a Russian appears,
he is a man in a bearskin-cap flogging a dying
woman through a snowstorm. The English idea
of Russia accordingly is a place where men in
bearskin caps eternally flog women through snow-
storms, and he concludes —“ What a ’orrible place !
It’s to be ’oped as the plucky Japs ’ll give ’em ’ell
an’ let those ’ere pore wimmen loose.”

That odoriferous puddle-hole in Moure
park (Sydney), euphemistically styled “Kippax
Lake,” is to be wiped out at last. Some people
proposed to waste £5OOO or £6OOO in preserving it
as an historical remnant of the. one-time swamp
lands that helped along old Sydney’s water supply.
During the inevitable argument, the puddle grew
daily more smellful, until the exasperated neighbors
rebelled and stirred the local council up with a
petition, then the Board of Health chipped in,
and the “ lake ” is to be filled up.

The sweetest song I’ll sing to thee,
A song of sun, and breeze, and sea,
Of summer, sky, and roses ;
Of spring, and mirth, and budding tree,
Of bird, and butterfly, and bee,
And dainty garden closes.
I touch my lyre. No note replies.
I strive to sing. My weak voice dies.
The effort’s unavailing.
But I’ll not grieve if thou despise
My song, if thou the spirit prize
Which rose above the failing.

Delightful was the Summer weather,
And brilliant was the Summer sky,
As we walked up the street together,
Another famous bard and I.
In spite of what the cynics tell us
That two of one trade can’t agree,
Of him I was in no way jealous—
Though, possibly, he was of me.
Then, walking down the street serene y,
We saw a lady tall and fair.
I knew her by her carriage, queenly;
I knew her by her eyes and hair.
I ra’sed my hat and spoke sincerely,
And made my very finest bow ;
“ Here is my friend, who loves you dearly,

Attacks on the policy of ex-Commandant
Hutton are now becoming general, and the pity of
it is that some of his critics were not courageous
enough to fight the man when he vvas here. To
be fair, Hutton’s scheme of organisation is largely a
matter of expert opinion. Military authorities
can be found to denounce it and applaud it.
What is beyond argument was Hutton’s manifest
leaning towards the Society element. “ Who is
he ? ” Hutton once asked when an unknown youth
applied for a commission. “His father is a big
squatter,” he was told. “Ah,” said Hutton, “ that
is the class of young fellow we want to get into
the service.” That remark was the keynote of
Hutton’s actions. The “ranker” was anathema
under his administration. A captain who has
done more than any dozen men for the Vic.
artillery during the past 12 years, was referred to
by Hutton as “that sergeant-major fellow.”
Another man who was a senior officer and about
whose efficiency there could be no question,
was passed over for a State commandantship,
apparently because he had once served as a
gunner in the R.A. A. Present Commandant
Finn, a promoted ranker, was roundly condemmed
as “unsuitable” by Hutton when mentioned for his
C resent high position. The condemnation had to
e withdrawn subsequently. According to pre-
sent indications, much of Hutton’s work—his
unconscious bias towards “ naice” soldiers, his
neglect of artillery and infantry to the dispropor-
tionate glorification of light horse—will shortly be
raked over, and an attempt made to sweep away
the discontent that affects everybody but the
handful of “ society ” incompetents.

Lord Milner lias found it necessary to
“officially deny” a statement that the Chinese
on the Band have been allowed to pitch their
tents on tl.e graves of fallen white soldiers. The
denial counts for little. Accepting it as true, as
Milner says, that the victorious Chow does not
pitch his tent right over the tomb of the white
fool who fought him into his billet, the fact is
unaltered that S’Afrioa is now the white man’s
grave, and that the Chow there is on top. Proba-
bly, being a utilitarian sort, he doesn’t plant his
bunk, but rather his pumpkin, over the white
man’s tomb.
The Tasmanian police keep much of the
spirit of the old lag times. The other day a posse
of them raided the camp of Frank Airie, a harm-
less simple, who was camping, without leave, on
Crown land. Airie fled on the approach of the
police, was fired at by them, and then his camp
and all his possessions destroyed by fire ! It was
a barbarous act, and would be visited with heavy
punishment by any but a lag-spirited Government.

Victorian Penal Department has altered its
bad, old rule which compelled a prisoner, brought
into court either as witness or accused, to appear
in a suit of broad-arrows. But another rule of the
same bad sort is still in full blast. When a man
is charged, a list of previous convictions, if any, is
handed up to the Judge. The jury isn't allowed to
know anything of an accused person’s past (unless
he likes to go into the witness-box) until he has
been found guilty ; and if a jury up to that point
isn’t to be trusted with the information, then the
Judge shouldn’t be trusted with it either. When
the accused has been found guilty, on the absolute
merits of the particular case with which the court
has been dealing, then it is time to hand up the
record —-but not before.
An unfounded rumor that Burns, Philp
and 00. had sold the old passenger liner Rockton
to the Jap Government was the cause of a mild
sensation in commercial Sydney the other day,
and served to show up the real benefit Australia
derives from the £200,000 a year expended on the
British navy. A loquacious person informed the
Customs, just as the Rockton was off to Japan,
that the Japs had bought her for a transport.
Whereupon the Customs withheld her clearance
papers, on the off-chance of avoiding international
barneying. As a further safeguard the Admiralty
was notified. The Admiralty for the most part
was flirting down at Hobart, and the senior officer
remaining pompously informed the Rockton that
she would shift from her buoy in Neutral Bay at
her peril. As a matter of fact this was a meaning-
less whoop. The whole British force available
consisted of one gunboat of 11 goat-power, with
her fires out, and a surveying ship, condemned
to the knacker’s yard, whose record in her palmy
days was about three knots. Of course, there
was no danger of Burns, Philp braving the wrath
of the naval person in the 11 goat-power gunboat.
B.P.’s reputation, if nothing else, prevented any
such breach of international law, and a telephone
message from the Collector of Customs would
have bailed the vessel up just as effectively as the
British whoop. But the significant fact remains
that had the detention of the vessel that day been
a vital matter, and had it depended on the war-
ships, hired at £200,000 a year, whether she got
away or not, the bird would have flown.

The destructive capacity of the human boy
was made manifest in the case of Frank Taylor
(aged 13) and James Turvey (aged 10), charged
with damaging property, and various other illegali-
ties, at Box Hill (Melb.), the other day. Here is
a synopsis of the boys’ performance. They visited
one house, upset two hives of bees and pelted a
nesting hen with her own imminent progeny, broke
into the house, ransacked drawers, smashed open
a box, stole a couple of pocket-knives and a pencil
ease. Seeking change, they visited another estab-
lishment, killed 47 valuable fowls, chickens and
ducks, and maimed many others (£l4 12s. repre-
sents the value of the killed). They played cricket
with young chickens for balls. Wearying of
slaughter, Frank and James moved on, caught a
pony in a paddock, and were busy riding its tail
off when captured. Jimmy was also charged with
setting fire to a grass paddock and burning eight
acres of grass and two haystacks, but that happened
a few days earlier, and not on one of his busy days.

Lecturing at Broken Hill on the Yellow
Curse in South Africa, A. G. Hales, war corres-
pondent, said that Japan had the greatest com-
bination of fleet and soldiery in the world. Aus-
tralia would be unable to repel them if they
resolved to come here, unless it attracted a white
agricultural population. The Turks were gradu-
ally driving the Macedonians out of Europe. The
Macedonians were a fine, bold, manly race, the
finest democrats he knew. When the next Turkish
massacre came about, the Macedonians might ask
leave to come to Australia, and Australians ought
to spread out their arms to welcome them. A
hundred thousand such men would be an effective
bari'ier to brown invasion. Which declaration
runs counter to most popular notions about the
Macedonians, who are usually given credit for
being nearly as bloodthirsty and unruly as the
Turks.
Dill Macky’s Botchman :
Father Hays, the Roman Catholic temperance advocate,
who has come to Australia to rebuke Cardinal Moran and
all his priests for criminally neglecting to promote habits
of sobriety amongst their flock should undertake a special
mission to publicans in each State. He would find that
the lliajori ‘ J of his audience would be Irish.
Dill, of course, never troubled to look up the
statistics on the subject: Ins Botchman saw the
chance to promote a little brotherly love, and
jumped at it. When the last census was taken,
reports of which were lately issued, there were
10,024 males in the various branches of the Bung
and Narcotic business (the two are bunched) in
N.S. Wales; and of the whole 10,024 only 627
were born in Ireland. More than double that
number—ls9B to be exact—were born in England
and Wales ; and, though there were only about half
as many Scotchmen as Irishmen in this country,
there were 334 Scotchmen in the business. Also,
as to the religions of the people in the various
branches of the Bung and Narcotic business, Dill’s
miserable little mischief-malang insect might look
«P the statistics with profit. Of males m N.S.W.
183,421 returned themselves as holy Romans and—
to name only one other large sect—72,o99 as
Methodists. There were 868 Methodists dealing
ln beer, &c. ; and on the same basis there ought to
have been 2200 holy Romans in the business; and
3 r et the census showed there actually were only
1565. So that even the Methodists, in proportion
to population, hand out beer and ’bacca in greater
numbers than the Romans.
After their conference N.S.W. irrigation
delegates were entertained at a picnic on the
Havvkesbury and lunched at an asylum for in-
ebriates, which is being established at Rabbit
Island. Bill Lyne proposed success to the asylum,
but not in water —oh, no !

youthful freshness until advanced age. It takes only
a few minutes to apply .at night, and the only
trace of it next day is the wonderful improvement it
has wrought to the skin. After once using it you will
feel absolutely satisfied that its value is worth three times
the money. But beware of substitutes. Valaze —small

A WOMAN’S LETTER.
Sydney, January 24, 1905.
My Dear Arini.
Up at Goulburn, where they have been holding
the annual Tirranna picnic race meeting, with a
pillar of fire for a starting post and a cloud of
smoke for a judge’s box, they, take their summer
dress-decorations as they come. Almost as big a
thing as the races themselves is the race ball,
whereat, according to the staidest paper, one belle
was robed in “white, decorated with twisted flip-
flaps,” while another matched it with “white
mousseline de soie, with boo-boos.” At another
“function” to which numerous city visitors
were bidden the guests were announced by a
functionary ’ who had backed four winners,
and, as the evening grew, backed many more in
bis prophetic eye .and drank to each. He was
delightfully frank in the introductions he roared ;
but as his additions to the names didn’t go beyond
complimentary remarks, he was encouraged to go
on, till he sent everybody busy talking about the
bush fires with this remark: “Mr. Fitzjumbuck
and—well, they say it’s his wife.”
Tirranna Picnic Race Club, which held its
fiftieth anniversary week before last with a record
crowd and in record heat, had an inception that
makes interesting reading. The late Mrs. Gibson
of Tirranna started in 1845 yearly picnics with
horse racing. She provided luncheon, and at night
there would be a dance at the homestead. For ten
years these picnic races were carried on by the
Gibsons alone, then the Chisholms and Gibsons
joined in; later still, in 1855, more “leading
families ” foregathered and formed the Tirranna
Picnic Race Club. Of the first members two are
still living, Messrs. Andrew Gibson and Andrew
Chisholm.
What a getting-up of stairs it is at the Lyceum !
Long girls, short girls, thin girls and portly girls
will whoop to hear that the toilsome flight of steps
leading from Pitt-street to the dress circle is to be
abolished. Mr. Musgrove, who has secured the
option of purchasing the Lyceum theatre—lock,
stock and barrel as a going concern—has had
plans prepared for refitting the interior. And it
is provided in the plans that visitors to the theatre
will be shot up to their places in any part of the
house by elevators. It is expected that the work
will be finished in about three months. The new
Lyceum will be the only theatre in the world
where a woman can get to her seat by electricity,
instead of by beaded satin shoe as heretofore.
More than one Australian theatre has had its
bright prospects blighted by the fact that every
playgoer is not necessarily a mountaineer.
First night of “Blind Man’s Buff,” at the
Lyceum, was greeted by a thickly-packed audi-
ence, from which the faces of a good many first-
nighters were missing—still away in the Mountains.
In the manager’s box with Mr. Musgrove were
daughter Nancy and Mrs. Maesmore Morris’s
small son Colin, two eager admirers of their
respective mothers on the stage.
Mis ; Nellie Stewart wore some lovely frocks in
this piece. The ball dress in the big scene in the
third act was the most bewitching garment seen
on the stage here for many a day. It was an
empire gown built in Paris, and perfect in cut and
style. The underskirt was of white satin, over
which was cloth of gold tissue lined with chiffon of
the same color. Over this again was a double
chiffon dress powdered with fine gold spangles.
Tne front was embroidered with roses in gold
tissue and white satin. With this frock, scarf
and mittens of gold chiffon and spangles en suite
were worn. The whole effect was most striking.
In the first act Miss Stewart wore a cornflower
s lk voile with folds across the shoulders, edged
With white satin applique. The upper part of the
sleeve was trimmed with Mechlin lace ; the skirt,
which was gathered round the waist, had two deep
tucks with pleated chiffon between. The dress in
the second act was a white satin slip covered with
white, rain-spot muslin and Torchon lace and
i nsertion. A pale blue silk bolero was worn with
black, gold and white belt. A white chip hat
crowned this dress with touches of pale blue, and
a magnificent Irish point lace scarf was draped
over it.
Mrs. Maesmore Morris wore four different
frocks during the play, the most noticeable of
them being a magenta glace silk walking dress
made with coat and skirt and folded white vest.
The coat was finished with passementerie worked
on yellow satin. Her ball gown was of pale-blue
Liberty silk trimmed with chiffon and lace and
tiny pink rosebuds. Miss Singleton wore some
very handsome dresses of exaggerated style, in
keeping with the character she was impersona-
ting.
Last week in noticing Mr. Laurence’s marriage
I referred to the “ late ” Mr. Alexander Dean. A
slip of the pen, of course. Mr. Alex. Dean is not
the “late,” very much otherwise; may he have
many happy years yet ahead of him !
Lately, during an inactive spell, my friends
comforted me with quantities of English maga-
zines, illustrated, and stayed me with English
society papers. Now I’m suffering from snob-
paragraph - and - professional - beauty nausea. Is
Fogtown-on-the-Thames ever weary of the publi-
cation of its ‘ ‘ beautiful ” aristocrats’ portraits ?
Apparently not, for in mags and sixpenny weekly
fashion p ipers and dreadful little penny weaklies,
they have the same old beauties whose beauty has
been in publication for the last 20 years. A
Book of Beauty, “containing portraits of the
most beautiful women in the world," has
been recently published, and one maga. has
produced some of the pictures. A painter
named Edward Hughes seems to have painted
the majority of the smart set. Princess Maud-of-
Wales-Charles-of-Denmark is, according to his
limning of her, as beautiful as any goddess who
ever set Olympus by the ears. Lady Warwick
(is n’t she a grandmother ?) out-dazzles the morning
star. The Pless lady and Mrs. Keppel are beauti-
ful enough to mash the archangels. Mrs. K. was
here with the Yorks. A fine-looking enough
woman, with good eyes. None here raved about
her. But perhaps we have n’t souls that grovel.
Our old friend, Lady Carrington, in a Joshua
Reynoldesh pose, holding a rose and clasping a
bare-footed radiant infant, also adorns the book.
Another maga., in an article on “ The Triumph
of the Tiara,” seizes the pretence and reproduces
the whole weary lot over again—Devonshire,
Chesterfield, Westminster, etc. under their
jewelled half-crowns. Do you recollect the sum-
ming up of the court beauties by an Australian poli-
tician’s wife who was in London during the jubilee
festivities? “Takeaway their clothes and what
are they ? They are all very ’aggard.”
George Meredith, the man who wants to intro-
duce a system of marriage on the time-payment
plan—goods to be returned at the option of the
buyer—has, it seems, got into the habit of saying
things. His latest is that “ women ought to be
parsons—they would make excellent parsons. ” Is
this gall just because women don’t care about his
marriage system and refuse to be sent back like a
worn carpet, or a moth-eaten chair, or a sofa with
an incurable leg ?
Echoes of furious festivities and frivolities float
across the water from Hobart, where Admiral
Fanshawe’s warships are practising splicing,
and other marine or matrimonial evolutions.
Hobart is crowded with Australian visitors,
mainly feminine, and ruddy times are the rule.
Captains, Commanders, and such who have begun
to grow wrinkles round the eyes and silver locks
on the nape of the neck, are largely left to con-
template the binnacle, but the sub-lieutenants are
given plenty of opportunities to do their parlor
tricks. Lots of Sydney people at all the caravan-
serais, among the sprightliest being Mr. and Mrs.
Bert Bilcher. A sweet young thing from the main-
land, who had been deposited by dad at a big hotel
to take a holiday by herself while he went away
to chase the oof-bird, gave a birthday
party in her own honor the other night.
Her gay little dinner, which was held in the
public dining.-room, was attended by a squad of
exuberant brass-bound boys, who made it “willing”
when the gold-top exhilarated them. Next morn-
ing they were presented with a few remarks by a
little coterie of their senior officers, who had been
quietly dining at the table in the far corner.
Phew ! Senior officers, under such circumstances,
should be blind.
Mount Kosciusko ought to be a good enough
place for a honeymoon in this weather, though
the accommodation there is rather defective. Mr.
and Mrs. Henry Manning started off for the
highest point in Australia immediately after the
ceremony at St. Mary’s Cathedral last week. An
iced honeymoon must be the last word in luxury.
By the way, an animated teetotum of much ball-
room experience whispers that Mrs. Manning
(who was Miss Nora Martin) is the most poetic
waltzer in Sydney.
An engagement is announced between Linda
Mary Rundle, second daughter of the late Jere-
miah Bruce Rundle, of Havilah, Sydney, and
Norman Burgoyne Perkins, second son of Henry
Australia Perkins, of Stoneleigh, Ewell, Surrey,
England. Miss Rundle and her sister have been
travelling in Europe for the last 16 months. The
marriage will shortly take place in London, and
the young couple will leave for a tour in Canada,
and expect to reach Sydney, where Mr. Perkins
has large interests, later in the year.
Talking of marriages : Mr. Percy Rowland who
wrote “ The New Nation ” has also taken a bride-
groom degree and gone as master to Townsville
Grammar School.
Talking about servants : Went to a large and
bustling registry office lately on business bent.
The waiting room where one interviews domestics
was adorned with texts and placards arranged in
curious juxtaposition. One large and legible text
read, “I will.commune with Thee,” and on the
same nail hung a sheet conveying useful informa-
tion about ferry steamers and a time-table of the
trains. Another text read, “I will supply thy
every need,” and beneath it, with unconscious
humor, the pious conductors of the registry office
had hung their tariff for meals and sleeping
arrangements, showing “generals” out of a job
how long they could prolong life on their accumu-
lated savings by living at the registry office.
Up at Wahroonga, there is a man who, when-
ever he advertises for a new cook, appends a line
saying, “ Cabs provided for use of servants.” He
cannot get a cook or a housemaid to stay at the
place on any other terms. It is a dangerous prin-
ciple to introduce, all the same. Probably, by
next Christmas, the boy who cleans the boots will
expect to have a motor-car kept for him.
Mrs. G. 11. Reid sold off at Homebush, and
migrated to a city flat, because no servants would
stay at “ Mount Royal.” It was too far from the
station, and Mr. Reid never thought of keeping a
four-in-hand for them.
Do you remember Miss Olga Morgan, a young
cousin of Mrs. B. R. Wise, who was in Sydney
awhile ago ? She had a studio for miniature paint-
ing, and was also very clever at children’s book
illustrations. A private letter tells me she is now
married to Mr. Bradbury, one of the owners of
London Punch. He was visiting Australia whilst
Miss Morgan, who may be described as sweet
looking, was here, and they met first at Mrs. Wise’s
house. She illustrated Punch’s Xmas book for
children.
Mrs. Ted Rundle and her child left for London
by the India on Saturday. Another holiday
departer, with her two little boys, was Mrs.
Taylor-Young, wife of one of Sydney’s leading
physicians; but she sought, not the fogs of London,
but the delights of Maoriland. Mrs. Young is a
noted golfer, and lady members of Sydney Royal
Golf Club presented her with a silver purse prior
to her going.
Engagement of Miss Ethel Manning (eldest
daughter of the late Judge Manning) to a Captain
Champion, late of a Lancer corps, is announced.
A private letter mentions that bridegroom-elect is
a relative of H. H. Champion, of Melbourne, who,
in his Tory and anti-Liberal days, was also an
officer in her late Majesty’s service. Lady
Manning and her youngest daughter, Clara, are
living in Sydney.
Bowral Golf Links had a great worrying last
Saturday. Twenty-eight golfers—from the Royal
Sydney, Botany, Marrickville, Killara, Goulburn,
and other clubs —took part in a competition for a
trophy, presented by Dr. .J. J. Power (Bowral).
Dr. Howse (Orange), Mr. J. Macarthur Onslow,
Dr. Jamieson, Mr. Walter Keigwin, Professor
Warren, and Mr. R. Innes-Noad were amongst
the players. Also, at Bowral, a lot of people who
sit on the top rail of Sydney Society gave an
entertainment in aid of the local hospital.
Miss Teece, the Misses Brunton, Eileen King,
and others, assisted. Mr. Innes-Noad, who has
been for years one of the best amateur actors
and reciters in Melbourne, trotted out his
tragic and comic muses. Mrs. Spencer Brunton
winked to the extent of being rewarded with
a bouquet (which means more than it sounds
these flowerless, scorched-garden days), and Mrs.
C. W. Marsden, who promoted the entertainment,
was presented with a silver-mounted parasol. To
be hoped the sunshade has a bagasse ceiling or an
art-metal roof—something that will exclude
Bowral sunrays, which, report says, have more
sunstrokes in them than the Sydney variety.
Hobart Cup race meeting last week brought
out a lot of Sydneysiders in glad gowns. Mrs.
Forbes-Sempill was like an animated all-in-flower
lilac-bush. That commanding military dame,
Mrs. Douglas Mackenzie, wore a grey uniform,
and Lady-o’-war Fanshawe a black and cream,
with a funeral plume in her hat. Lady
Edeline Strickland, the Governor’s wife, has
proved a smart dresser, and came out in a cham-
pagne chiffon over blue silk with a jacket of
guipure lace.
The city parks have for years been splendid
places for women to keep away from. Now that
the City Council is to control them, it is to be
hoped that they will receive a comprehensive
wash and brush-up, and that an intelligent effort
will be made to get rid of the unspeakable frowsi-
ness that hangs over most of them. I am in-
clined to think that the habit of grabbing one’s
skirt, hauling it across like the main sheet on a
windy day, and clewing it well up above the ankles,
originated in the Sydney parks. Girls had to be
so careful in going through these sylvan spots, that
they absent-mindedly continued to grab at them-
selves when they got out on the pavement. They
picked their way so gingerly among sleeping
remittance-men, broken bottles, and the remains
of last week’s lunch, that they went on exercising
the same care when the need for it was over. It
will be a joyful day for us all if the City Council
will post up a notice in every park, setting forth
that insects are strictly prohibited, and that
“dossers” are respectfully requested not to go to
bed in the sight of the public. Also, the draggled
grass might be given a chance to grow green again.
Tea-rooms seem to be increasing in Sydney
nearly as fast as rabbits on the Murrumbidgee.
But most of them might be used for Turkish
baths instead of tea-rooms, with a few alterations.
What is the matter with the roof-garden tea-
room ? If some simple precautions were adopted
so as to prevent the buttered scones being blown
away by fresh air travelling at excessive speed,
the roof-garden tea-room would be a most desir-
able novelty for the summer.
Writes my Melbourne correspondent:—
“News was cabled through last Monday of the
death of Mrs. Margaret Chirnside —widow of
Robert—the eldest of the Chirnside brethren.
The deceased lady removed to the Cold Country
after the death of her husband, and has been
residing thereabouts for the past year or two. She
died at Clacton-on-Sea, after being in ill-health
for a long time. Never a Society dame, the late
Mrs. Chirnside spent her large income with com-
posure, doing a good deal of good to the poor in
a quiet way, and touching everyone by her ex-
treme gentleness. One daughter is married, and
three or four sons are studying for various pro-
fessions.
“Tummy Bent was asked up to stay at the
rose arbor that mostly makes up the vice-regal
dwelling on the Macedon heights, the other day.
It is difficult to fit the round man into the square
picture where the two tall, lean, angular aristo-
crats loom as hosts. A politician not long from
London tells me that King Ned and our Reggie were
in a sort of way pals, and that it was over a friendly
chop that the King remarked : ‘By the way,
Talbot, I want you to go out to Victoria. There’s
a Governor wanted.’ ‘ Yes, sir,’ said Reggie,
sipping his sherry. And the thing was done.
A more probable and natural yarn runs this
way : One morning the Sec. of State for the
Colonies, looking over his mail, remarked to the
Under-Sec. : ‘ I see there’s a Governor wanted in
Victoria; that’s somewhere in Australia. Look
up the screw they pay, and get them a decent
johnnie. Not an earl or anything like that, some-
thing in the baronet line. jße careful that he isn’t
a Roman Catholic or too much of a Protestant,
and if he’s an Irishman that he hasn’t been shot
at too often by his tenantry. By the way, too, a
married man. ’ And the faithful XJnder-Sec. looked
up his list of eligibles and was able to get Reginald
without even worrying a registry office.
“ Hobart’s girl season comes to an end. The
Pylades left last week for Colombo, and the fleet
threatens to break up further. So far, the only
engagement among the boys in blue is to the
credit of a fascinating Sydneyite. No practical
result of the Toorak charmers’ campaign has yet
been acknowledged.
“Annette Kellermann, the brown sea-nymph,
took the listless Adelaide Johnnies by storm,
despite that she did tack on a deep frill to the
brief bathing-suit of Melbourne memory. A con-
tingent of Holy City boys saw her off—most
reluctantly. They say the son of a big and
wealthy politician has offered his fortune (with
himself thrown in) to the sportful nymph.
“The finest mansion in Toorak has gone into
the hands of a boarding-house ma’am, who opens
the residence to flat-dwellers and casual boarders
with a lot of fuss this month. The owners of the
mansion are residing in Mayfair, where their
flunkeys have a chance of getting friendly with
the flunkeys of dukes and such like, and their
proud selves have no fear of rubbing up against
the Gibeonites who drag their wealth for them
out of the reluctant soil of Australia.
“The dainty widow of Colonel Bingham is
sampling the London fog in company with her
two Madden nieces. They will linger there for a
while, and then dwell another while with the Val-
langes before resuming the collection of fresh
luggage-labels.
“ Another woman doctor hangs out her shiny
plate—at Albert Park, where coming and going
of population is pretty brisk, and the pram and
the hearse are to be often seen in the streets.
She has returned after four years at Edinburgh,
where, she says, girl-students are given a great
time, and when once through their medical course
‘haven’t to face the prejudice and scepticism of
their own sex.’
“Father Hays —the temperance persuader—
was a disappointment to the romantic young
things who took an early perch at his intro-
ductory Town Hall meeting. They expected a
melodramatic beer-curser or a picturesque plat-
former of the Yay de Yaya order. What they
saw was a spare young cleric, shrinking into the
large platform chair. Round him were train-lamp-
faced fathers, ghostly shepherds, and plump, Yan
Yean brethren wearing tinfoiled Cold Tea Society
sashes. After a programme of green songs and
drink-condemning speeches, the worn little tem-
perance apostle rose slowly to his feet, took a
leisurely stride to the front of the planks, nodded
his notice to the excited applauders, and in a
small, thin, conscious voice started to return
thanks. Every tenth word struck a vibrant nasal
note. When lie doesn’t coo with teetotal weak-
ness, the persuader roars like ten thousand trom-
bones.
“The Maria Gordons are moving on to Sydney-
side, the change of military State heads having
affected them. Victoria never took to the long,
tawny General with the excessive haw-haw, but
liked Mrs. Maria Gordon, who is charming
of speech. Mrs. Gordon was a Miss Fitzgerald -
one of the brewery clan, and a Castlemaine
beauty.
• “ The she-bowlers of this State got through the
‘jack’—or whatever it is they do—with extra
frill, on a recent Saturday, at Middle Park. The
fair sports didn’t appear to be wisely dressed for
the game. Some wore tight skirts and tighter
blouses, threatening to split at the arm hollow's
every time any energy was exhibited. Others had
fantastic skirt-tails, which dragged despondently
after them as they played the stout man’s game.
And mostly all were straight-fronted, so that the
corset-strain must have been" great. Bowls may
bring the respectable suburban father a lot of joy,
but to the woman w'ho cherishes the erect form,
and thinks to keep throwing the ‘jack’ to the
tune of a 22in. waist, there can be neither profit nor
pleasure.
“Miss Muriel Mayston, a young singer of
pleasant tone, has been advised to go and join the
strugglers in London. She will get her range
polished up awhile in Paris, and then for Fame-
or disappointment. Benefit concerts are an-
nounced on her behalf.
“Miss Charlotte Hemming had the bad luck t<
be in a buggy spill last week. Her injuries were
a general blue bruise and an arm fracture. Now,
less than anyone could the pleasant Charlotte
afford to injure her elbow, for what is a humorous
reciter less her funny-bone ?
“ How can an impartial and kindly parent look
on and see one daughter cut out another in an
eligible’s affections on the road to matrimony!
Melbourne has at present two such cases.
“ A sad case of December and May is engaging
the tongues of a large circle of friends. A separa-
tion is threatened, and then a young wife will
drift back to her sorrowful parents. Parents who
are ready to thrust their young daughters into the
chafing yoke of matrimony with ‘ any old thing ’
lest another chance should not come may take
a lesson from this.
Yours Affectionately,
AKENEHI.


COULD NOT SLEEP.
Sleeplessness is not healthy. It is a sure sign that there is something wrong with your blood and
nerves. When they get out of order, you should not lose a day before starting a good course of Dr. Williams’
Pink Pills. They actually make new blood. And new, pure, rich, red blood is the only thing in ti e
world that can soothe and strengthen the nerves. That is how Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills cure Sleeplessness.
“No one knows better than I, how wretched it is to lie night after night without closing an eye ” said
Mrs. Caroline Mortimer, 51 Westbourne-street, Petersham, Sydney. “ For years 1 could not sleep. ’ I was
growing more of a wreck every day. My head and back ached without ceasing. I was so bilious that the
sight of food turned me sick. I don’t know how I lived, for I could never eat anything like a good meal.
Every day I grew weaker. Often I toppled right over with dizziness. The least exertion made my heart beat
like mad. I was so nervous that I wouldn’t stay in the house alone. I felt that I would have given anythin'--
for one hour’s sleep. I spent pounds and pounds on different medicines, but 1 got no relief till I started
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills. They actually made new blood for me, and in a few weeks 1 was better in everv way.
My appetite picked up, and I gained weight. Soon I was able to sleep the night through. Then my
nerves grew sound and steady, and my heart gave me no more trouble. I have the greatest faith in
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills. Since they cured me I’ve never had the least thing wrong with me.
My health to-day is perfect.”

shifting job at 12s. 6d. per day.
Dowie bided his time before proclaiming
himself a reincarnation of Elijah ; and if the wind
blows steadily from the right quarter, ’Lige will

A male infant at Geelong (Vic.) was

Will Ashton, the young Adelaide artist
who worked his passage to England and came
back on a saloon ticket, returns to the Cold Coun-
try shortly. He intends taking with him a great
many sketches of Australian scenery.
A Mildura magnate is credited with having
made an apt allusion during the visit of Governor
Talbot and his little suite to the red-hot raisin
country. He said he was very glad to be one to
welcome “ His Excellency and sweat ” to Mildura.
Ralph Hodgson, the Sydney doctor with
the very square shoulders, died suddenly last
week, aged 50 — perhaps a victim to his own theory
that Australians could not eat too much meat, or
eat it too often, and that fruit and vegetables were
akin to poisons.
Died lately in S. Aus. Baron Le Brun,
whose father was aide-de-camp to Napoleon.
The eccentric old chap had buried himself in the
wilds of Port Lincoln, though years ago, and often
since, he was notified that large wealth awaited
his claim in France.
It is proposed in Sydney to erect a
memorial to Joseph Banks, as founder of the
State of N.S.W. and the munificent patron of
Captain Cook’s expedition, which discovered the
continent. Mr. Edward Brown, of 109 Pitt-st., is
sec. to the movement.

been suffering from bad health, and has not made
much progress.
In answer to a definite question, Victorian
Premier Bent says that he has no knowledge
whatever of Andrew Bent, the Hobart Town
printer and newspaper man of the twenties whom
Governor Arthur is said to have deported to
Sydney, and who died in the Benevolent Asylum,
Sydney, in 1850.
Joseph Hector Carruthers, who has deleted
“O’Neil” from his name, aspires to “know not
Joseph” in the early future. He will rely on
“Hector”—when it’s Sir Hector Carruthers.
Joseph is about sft. high, and has all the marked
dignity of a cock-sparrow. As “Sir Hector” he
will be just grand.
An aboriginal brought a baby to Jim Gem-
mell, boss of Arcoona Station (Northern S.A.),

“Thinkit caJU’m Percy, eh?”

“Hey! Hurry up! Don't yer want to hear wot

Died at Ipswich, Q., aged 66, “ Handsome
George ” Thorn, one time Premier of the Northern
State and a prominent figure for the last 40 years.
The ex-Premier was one of the last of the
“Pure Merinos” who made history up North in
the middle seventies. Of his colleagues, S. W.
Griffith, Chief Justice of Australia, and R. M.
Stewart, now in England, are left. Like all pro-
fessional politicians, he died poor.
Some 14 years ago a watch was presented
to George Dean for saving life in Sydney Harbor,
his name being engraved inside the case. When
Dean went to gaol the watch went a-roaming. The
other day a Balmain jeweller informed a friend of
Dean’s that he had bought it as old silver, so Dean
went over and, paying the same price as the
jeweller gave for it, received back the old watch.
“I’ll charge ye nothing for doing her up,” said
the Scotch clock-maker; “ ’twas a good deed, mon,
to save a life.”
Ryan (son of surgeon Charley Ryan, of
Plevna and Melbourne), who came out of the
Woolwich (Eng.) annual exam, top man of his
year, and by so doing has his choice of any regi-
ment, was formerly a brilliant scholar and athlete
of Geelong College. He is just the type of youth
that the Australian military forces want. Yet,
because it is considered more aristocratic to be-
long to the Imperial service, he is lost to his own
country, and will have to spend years under some
eye-glassed imbecile, who got his own commission
through faked exams.

A pension of £338 Is. has fallen into the
N.S. Wales Treasury through the death in London
of Edmund Burton, at one time a Commissioner of
Titles. Mr. Burton came to Australia in the
fifties and was admitted to practice as a solicitor.
He was 81 years of age at the time of his death.
He retired from office in 1892.
Died the other day, R. A. Johnstone, ex-
Police Superintendent and ex-Police Magistrate
(Q.). Entered the force in 1871, climbed to a
superintendentship, and with a command of native
police did some exploring work in the North,
where the aborigine was pugnacious, and occa-
sionally took his with ginger in it. Retired to a
P.M.-ship in 1881, and dropped out altogether on
a pension ten years later. In his uncompleted
reminiscences, which were running through the
Queenslander at the time of his death, he had
many readable things to say.
Deceased George Thorn served articles
with Horace Tozer, under Malbon Thompson, in
Ipswich, 40 years ago. His Premiership was a
mere stop-gap piece of boodle politics, and his
light was finally extinguished by Jenkinson, a
Gympie journalist, at Fassifern, by 58 votes.
George was big and good-natured, with a Bill
Lyne love for political intrigue, but too easy-going
for the gang about him. He was skilled in feats
of parlor magic,'and could plant the “little
beauty ” in the three-card trick with the nimble-
noss of a professor. He won 12s. 6d. from the
present writer just to prove it —but the money
’ went to the poo rbox.
Father Hays, the R.C. temperance
lecturer, has had wonderful receptions in Mel-
bourne : the enthusiasm for him of the ultra-
Protestant temperance folk was remarkable.
President Hunt’s remark, “Father Hays is
ready to enter any church of any denomination,”
created quite a sensation. Mrs. Harrison Lee
waxed eloquent and florid : “We want you to be
another St. Patrick,” she said ; and later, “From
blocks of ice, lo ! a miracle—sparks of fire as-
cended.” Father Hays’ anecdotes are worth
quoting: “A boy in England made a trap to
catch sparrows. His sister prayed that the trap
would be a failure, then went out into the yard
and kicked it to pieces. She afterwards told her
mother that she was quite sure her prayer would
be heard.” Then of course the moral—do away
with the drink trap altogether.
Melbourne Herald lately resurrected the
list of the rejected living ex-members of the
Victorian State Houses. Victoria’s first Parlia-
ment was opened 21st Nov., ’56, and since then
nearly 700 legislators have helped, for a more or
less brief space, to run the country into debt. Of
these some 180 still survive, among them six
ex-Premiers Bryan O’Loghlen, James
Munro, George Turner, Allan M‘Lean,
Peacock, and Irvine. Five members of the
first Parliament still live —George Coppin,
J. Dennistoun Wood, P. Phelan, Chas.
Read, and J. B. Crews. Crews repre-
sented St. Kilda from ’56 to ’65, and
South Bourke from ’6B to ’77, and still
resides in Prahran, an old man of 82.
Phelan and Read each had a three-
years spell, then retired, and still
dwell at Northcote and Geelong re-
spectively. J. D. Wood is the oldest
living Victorian Executive Council-
lor, having been Solicitor-General
in the first O’Shanassy Govt.,
March 11th to April 29th. ’57.
Bryan O’Loghlen, who won his
first seat in ’7B, and sat pretty
continuously till ’94, was elected
for Clare to the British House
of Commons, but never sat;
was Attorney General from ’7B
to ’BO, Premier and Treasurer
from ’Bl to ’B3, and Attorney-
General from ’93 to ’94 with
“Jingo” Patterson—and that
killed him politically. £ £
Smith adorned the second
Parliament in ’59. He once
got as far as being an honorary
Minister.
“ F.” : The attempt of
N.S.W. Church of England to
appropriate what credit attaches
to holding the first Sunday reli-
gious ceremony in Australia shows
substantial cheek. The Rev. John-
son was a Methodist, not aO. E., and
not even an orthodox Methodist, but
of the Moravian variety, and not much
even of that. He was a good farmer,
a good orchardist, and the first to grow
the beguiling grape in the new land. He
was also the first Australian author, his
little duodecimo bearing date 1792. Presumably,
he exercised little influence, spiritual or temporal.
An absurd Sydney P.O, regulation that
operators must wear coats when worrying the
wires in their room (secluded from the public) was
summarily ended last week. Said that a con-
tributing cause to the change was a visit paid to
the permanent head of the P.O, by one of the
State Governors, who found the official working
in his shirt-sleeves.
A gay and colossal politician down South
has a regiment of sisters more colossal even than
himself, and just as well-known for their size.
Lately the reprobate entered a pub., and, in virtue
of his bulk, political and otherwise, put his arm
around the barmaid’s waist. There were unnoticed
strangers present; wherefore' the barmaid had to
be indignant. “Sir!’’she said, eyes flashing—
“ how dare you ! What would you say if a man
put his arm round your sister?” And the poli-
tician, trained to swiftly creep through any hole,
promptly gave the soft answer that turneth into a
laugh—“l would say that he had a mighty
armful.”
Melb. Argus is sad over the decadence of
the Commonwealth military system under General
Finn. It deplores the present lack of ceremony.
Finn now walks into his office without any fan-
fares. Hutton used to enter with all the honors
of gaw. An orderly was kept on look-out duty,
and as soon as he saw the brilliantine shining on
Hutton’s curly head at the other end of St. Kilda
road he would cry loudly, “The general officer
commanding the forces is approaching.” Upon
which all the soldiers available would line up, the
military clerks would leave their desks, and every-
body would stand to attention and salute and grovel
until Hutton had closed the door of his office
behind him.. Now the staff does its work in plain
clothes, even in shirt sleeves on hot days; and
Finn strolls about in a grey check suit, and does
his work without gold-lace fireworks.
The cables tell that after the fall of
Port Arthur, Barnum Powell gave Stoessel a
patronising pat on the back, quite in the manner
of a superior person who has done bigger things
in that line himself. In Chris. Healy’s “Con-
fessions of a Journalist ” appears this: —
Here and there one may meet a common soldier who,
in rude, simple speech, will give a more graphic picture
of the second Boer war than is contained in the official or
unofficial histories. In August, 1902, I had the good
fortune to hear . . . from a reservist, who was one of the
first men sent out and one of the last to return. “ Baden-
Powell,” he said, in passing, “ is the only man that ever
bluffed the British Empire. The siege and sufferings of
Mafeking were a huge farce. The authorities hushed up
the truth, because if the public knew they had been taken
in they would have demanded Baden-Powell’s head on a
charger.” It is true that this opinion is given in military
rooms and clubs when men who were at or near Mafeking
foregather, but the press can never suffer its dignity to
be ruffled by admitting the huge “fake” that Baden-
Powell worked upon it.
They are telling of a settler in the vicinity
of Cassilis, Vic., who, when hot pressed by the
bush fires, finding his house in flames, took refuge
in a square iron tank, and remained there while
the water got hotter and hotter, bobbing his head
out of the man hole every now and again, only to
find the smoke and flames still curling around him.
At length, when he was half-boiled, and he saw
that to remain in the tank meant that he would be
irretrievably “in the soup,” the pink, blistered
victim made a frantic jump from his refuge and
discovered that the bush fires had long since
passed by, but the heavy wooden platform on
which the tank was erected was blazing fiercely.
The half-boiled settler was subsequently conveyed
to hospital, and is now doing as well as a semi-
cooked person could reasonably expect.
In Richard Hargrave, dead at Armidale
(N.S.W.) at the age of 88, passed out the last
member of N.S.W.'s first elected Parliament. He
was born at Greenwich (Eng.) in 1817, and came
to Sydney in 1839. Entered into partnership in
the squatting business with Hughes and Hqskins,
merchants and station owners, Sydney ; took 500<>
cattle across the MTntyre River—being the first
white man to cross the stream thereabouts —and
formed stations at Callendoon and Gundiwindi,
on the MTntyre, and at Wliyemoo and Beeboo,
on the Severn. The failure of his partners as
merchants, and of the old Bank of Australia in
1845, flung him to the bottom of the financial
ladder again. Timely assistance from England
arrived, however, and he bought Hillgrove
station, and thenceforth the New England
district was his home. He represented Armidale
in the first elected Parliament, but three years of
legislating wearied him, and he hied back to the
land. He was younger brother to the late Judge
Hargrave.
“Mahor” on Peter Lalor’s inconsis-
tencies :—•
Par. (8., 24/12/’O4) brings to mind his connection with
introducing Chinese labor to Lothair Gold Mine, Glunes
(Vic.). Miners went out on strike against working night
shift on Saturday night, or really Sunday morning.
Directors (Peter Lalor and the late J. G. Francis were two
of them) gave the men to understand that, if they would
not give way, Chinese would be brought from Ballarat to
work in their places. The men were inflexible, so the co.
built houses to accommodate Chinese. Coach loads of them
left Ballarat. As soon as the men heard this, they pro-
ceeded to build a barricade across the road with stones and
wood, to prevent the coaches getting into town. Scouts
were sent out to look for the invaders, and, on news of
their being in sight, fire-bells were rung. Men lined up
at the barricade, horses were unharnessed, and the coaches
lifted bodily around. Drivers, seeing the impossibility
of getting to the mine, harnessed horses and drove their
frightened loads back to Ballarat. Riot Act and other
ceremonies were gone through by the police, but without
avail. This was probably the first attempt to introduce
Chinese into Victorian mines to compete against white-
labor, but was happily frustrated. Co. eventually
accepted men’s terms.
LATE RICHARD HARGRAVE, one of the
Members of the first Parliament of N.S.W.
Photo, by C. B. Broivn, Armidale.
Roderic Quinn, poet and prose-writer, these
days wanders mournfully outside N.S.W. Govern-
ment buildings, an unfeeling Joseph having cast
him out of the public service. It was alleged that
there was no need for the work Quinn was doing.
That will be better decided when it is discovered
whether Joseph has some pet of his own to push
into the “useless” position. In America they
have a system of recognising writers of merit by
giving them a certain preference of employment
in the civil service, and—always supposing no loss
of efficiency is incurred thereby—the model is-
worth imitating.

“ Dyckolt ” : On the Darling, we once
picked up with a fellow picturesquely known as
“Cockney the Rager,” who was a sort of wicked
Francis of Assissi. His language was more than
lurid, and his mania was feeding birds—apostle
birds and butcher-birds, and other carnivora.
Like us, he’d get his meat allowance at the
stations, but, instead of cooking it, he’d cut it up
and feed the birds. In less than no time he’d be
surrounded by swarms of chirping mendicants.
He’d give them every ounce, and then cadge meat
of us at dinner-time. After a day or two, we got
tired of feeding him. “ How the crimson, carmine,
sanguinary blazes are the birds to live if I don’t
feed the blanky blanks!” he yelled. “Nobody
else does ! ”

“ Hamer ” : Some of the Victorian news-
papers, a week ago, got quite excited over a case of
faith-healing of snakebite. My theory is that, if
a man “dies of snakebite,” the chances are four to
one that he has frightened himself to death or
been whiskified to death. Most snakebite victims
would recover if they were simply left to them-
selves and didn’t worry.
BOLDING HIM.
BOB: “Hello, Benny, new horse?"
BENNY : “Yes, bloke out at Barney's pub, near Springs, day afore-.yestidee, guv me sixpence to
hold him! ”
“Gilrooney”: Wonderful what a man
- S + \ carce - J h f ve a P pre '
ciated the dryest book m the world when it was
the only book within a dozen miles. Also I have
read and re-read a preserved and faded copy of
some newspaper or magazine, then picked out the
editorial and typographical errors and sought the
signs that denote whether the matter was manually
or machine-set. That faded copy was the only
link between me and the great world or between
me and insanity, and I dared not destroy it until
another paper came to hand.
“ Elmore ” : For the first time in my
experience I saw laughing-jackasses knocked out
by the heat, on Jan. Ist, 1905. They lay
dead and dying all over the place, and had
birds of all descriptions for company.
Under one gum tree I counted six
jackasses, four magpies, three wag-
tails, and four other birds.
Close by under a box tree
hundreds of bees had dropped
dead from a hive above. In
a little running creek thou-
sands of blackfish and trout
were floating on the water;
even the vabbies failed to
burrow deep enough to escape
the heat, and were lying dead
in hundreds close to the bank.
The rabbits did not seem to
be affected at all, but hares
lay gasping under every
tussock and would not, or
could not, move even when
handled. This was up in the
hills of N.E. Vic., where they
reckon it’s nice and cool in
the summer.
★ * *
“E.J.D.”: Any person ac-
quainted with the Australian bush
cannot fail to observe the notice
which every living thing accords
to the alarm note sounded by the
minahor “ soldier bird.” Heought
to be called the “alarm bird.” His
shrill, excited warning is instantly re-
sponded to by the ducks on whom the
sportsman is creeping ; by the chickens
when a hawk or crow heaves in view ; by
the kangaroo and wallaby, the horse, the
sheep, the dog, the cat, and man himself.
The birds, and even the snakes, look
round hurriedly at his warning, for he
gives notice when any or every animal is
menaced. And withal he is such a love-
able, gentle, harmless little fellow ; give
him a few crumbs and he will soon
approach near enough to eat out of your
hand.
“ A.T.G.” : Twelve years ago Booth’s
religious cadge struck Hughenden on the Flinders.
It prospered for some time on the nomad’s half-
crowns, then died. Last year a “captain, ’ who
understood something of the creed of the Western
bushman, came to Cambridge Downs, and while
wandering through the shearers’ hut he fell across
these books: Tom Paine’s “Age of Reason,”
Ingersoll’s “God Dies and Nature Lives,” Max
Nordau’s “ Conventional Lies of Our Civilisation.”
These gave him his cue. That night he held forth
about the great slum and prison rescue-work of
the Army, and let the blood and the fire and
brimstone remain in abeyance. He played cornet
solos, and the crowd gathered round well. But the
collection only totalled 30s. The day before they
collected £2O to send an afflicted mate to Towns-
ville. The bush is all right still.
“ Flabby Paul”: Saw a remarkably narrow
escape the other day. It was in the construction
of a railway bridge. They were launching a steel
80ft. girder. Two men were on the girder, which
was hanging over a sheer drop of 100 ft. The
girder went safely out till its end was hanging
about sft. over the pier which was to receive it.
The order was given to lower away, when the
chain round the girder snapped and the huge mass
of metal dropped with a crash—into its exact
appointed place. Could n’t have been placed
better. The two men on it were as white as
sheets. If the chain had broken five minutes
earlier they would have been precipitated on to
the rocks below, probably with the girder on top
of them. The most scared man there was the
supervising engineer, although he was on the bank
away from danger. It took three drinks to set
him up again.
* » * *
“Tara”: I know in Cairns (N.Q.) dis-
trict a man who broke his neck and lived. He
was riding a mule one day when it threw him.
He was removed unconscious. After a lapse of
some time, he recovered his senses to find that his
head seemed to hang anyhow. He had to carry
it in both hands until he reached medical aid. It
was found that the neck was actually broken, but
the spinal cord is in no way injured. The patient,
for three months, was packed in plaster of Paris
from the head to below the armpits. Result: As
well as ever only for a stiffness in the neck.

“ D.H.R.” : “ Zip ” (8., 22/12/’O4) writes
that the rabbit is no polygamist; “should there
be an unattached marriageable doe in a burrow, a
council of war is held by the assembled wedded
bucks, and the superfluous female is invariably set
upon and put to death.” Would “Zip” be kind
enough to tell me the brand he drinks?
DURING THE WRESTLING BOOM.
LITTLE BISES (who is trying to explain away an
accident): “ Well , I don't wander bray, but
you ouyhter sec Haggensmidt! ”
“6x8”: “In the course of my duties I
get a look into many homes,” said my medical
friend, “and experience has taught me that mar-
riages between Protestants and Romans are gener-
ally fairly happy mixtures. Was called to a sub-
urban cottage, t’other day. The only two pictures
adorning the family bedroom were those of King
William and the new Pope. ‘ How does we git
on?’ said the missus. ‘Foine, Oi tells yez;
sliplendid ! Av corrse, moi mahn ish a black
Protishtant, but that makes no difference. Oi
goes to mass, an’ he goes to ’is own churrch, an’
we niver tahlks about it nor argue the point all the
year. The only toime we has a barney is on the
12th of Juloi, bahd luck ter it. That day moi
mahn goes ter a lodge an’ comes home from it as
drunk as an owl, an’ the furrst thing’e does, when
he lands, is ter smash the Pope’s picture in ter
shmithereens. He takes ’im down an’ kicks ’im,
an’ jumps on ’im wid his dirty boots, an’ yilling
like a hathen savage ’e dances a lot o’ dem fancy
Protishtant cake-walks on ’im, an’ then ’e quoietly
turrns in. Oi niver sez a wurrd at all, at all.
But next mornin’ Oi gets up urrly an’ takes down
King Billy an’ pawns ’im at old Abraham’s round
the corner. Wid the money Oi buys a noo Pope
an’ hangs ’im up. When moi mahn gits up wid a
head as big as two prize-pumpkins Oi sez ter ’im,
sez Oi : “ ’Ere ye are, ’ere’s the ticket, yez better
go an’ bail King Billy out; e’s in pawn round at
old Abraham’s.’’ ’E niver sez a wurrd, but puts
on ’is coat quoite-like an’ goes straight ter the
three ball-shop and gits ’is William back, an’
comes ’ome an’ hangs ’im up agin. After that
there’s pace, blessed pace in the house, till the
12th of Juloi—bahd luck ter it—comes round

“Exile”: Re “Jack M.” on stutter-
ing (8., 12/l/’O5). Anyone who stutters, how-
ever badly, can generally speak the word
which blocks the way by taking a breath. In
singing, the preliminary inhalation is instino-
tive, hence the stutterer being able to sing
without trouble. A professor I knew in London
used to give his stuttering pupils a gentle dig in
the solar plexus with his linger whenever they got
stuck. This caused them to draw in air quickly
and seemed to take off the brake. Though
stuttering is partly due to nerves, it is largely a
matter of trying to force speech with empty lungs.
If the lungs are kept full, as the bag in pipe-play-
ing, hesitation ceases. Constant practice at taking
breath between each word will, in time, cure a
stutterer.

One of the two New Guinea natives brought
over to Australia by Bishop Stone-Wigg has the
most magnificent calves, of mahogany hue, that
ever gladdened the world-weary heart of a dowager
duchess. And they taper down into well-
formed and small ankles. Above they show up
finely against the flowing robes of white linen in
which these barefooted converts from cannibalism
are attired. It was common in Sydney to see
crowds of boys following these golden Guineas
along the street, saying enviously to one another :
“ Did you ever see legs like them afore ?”
I have lived on ’roo flesh in
all parts of Australia six months at a stretch
sometimes, and reckon you can’t beat it. Gener-
ally reckoned the Boomey is superior in the
West. Don’t know why, but t’othersiders ' are
unanimous on that. In ’93 there was more ’roo
sold in butchers’ shops at Perth than there was
jmnbuck or bull. Certainly it was a bit cheaper ;
still in ’O5 plenty of ’roo is retailed by up-
country butchers. Touching retailing, I
keep a pet ’roo, and get a few inches of
tail off for soup every month, and the
growth is now stronger than ever.
“W.S.T.”: It has been said that “Aus-
tralia has given neither indigenous fruit nor grain
to civilisation,” but it is certain that many of our
wild fruits could be improved by scientific de-
velopment. The three most susceptible of im-
provement are probably the black apple, the
tamarind, and the red and white lillipilli. The
first is not unlike a large purple persimmon, and
is too sweet for most tastes. It has a handsome
bean-shaped seed, sometimes pierced and used for
rustic bracelets, but the fruit grows on a tall tree
that would have to be dwarfed. The tamarind
has a delicious sub-acid flavor', but grows on a
lofty palm-like stem, so that you have to wait till
the bunches fall, when the fruit is perhaps past its
best. The lillipilli is better known to city folk, as
it still grows in the more fertile gullies of George’s
River and the South Coast brushes. These three
fruits have their habitat in the coastal districts,
from the Tweed to the Shoalhaven. Under the
head of a possible fruit also may be classed the
quondong, from the Never Never land, though it
would take much trouble to make this skinny
gully-product into a real fruit.
ANOTHER WIDOW UNPROVIDED FOR.
COMFORTING FRIEND: “Has your husband made
his will?”
PROSPECTIVE WIDOW : “ Yes , the wretch. He's
left everything to the doctor if he cvres ’im, an'
not a blessed farthin' to his widder an ’ orphans."
“War E.” : Much wonder is expressed at
the small number of sheep burnt in the recent
bush fires. The explanation is easy. The fire
swept over holdings with such rapidity that fool
boundary-riders were unable to disturb the sheep
in their paddocks; consequently, the flocks in-
stinctively made off to their “camps,” or, if
caught by the fire, huddled up into a small space,
when only the outside sheep were scorched and
the others escaped unharmed. To rush sheep on
a hot day means that a large percentage drop be-
hind exhausted, and the balance “string out,”
seeking a shade anywhere—they are then at the
mercy of a fire. The worst loss of sheep I know
of occurred near Wagga (N.S.W’.), and was
caused by a boundary-rider attempting to “save”
them.

WILD CLEMATIS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Dazzling beauty in the cutting,
Where the roadway winds and turns,
Where the wet rocks, sharp and jutting,
liaise their heads above the ferns,
When the warmth of early sunbeams
Lifts the vapor’s resting light,
Hard by laughing, hidden sun-streams
Grows the wild clematis white.
Tinkling sounds of bell-birds singing,
Singing gaily to the morn,
Through the brushes cool are ringing,
Echoed by the cliff-walls worn.
Eain-drops—gems of splendor—glisten,
Mock the jewels of the night,
Here where Spring has stopped to listen
Grows the wild clematis white.
All the echoes of the falling
Distant waters in the hills,
Through the gaps and gorges calling
Sing the song of dancing rills.
Sing for ever where the flowers
Bloom in earthly Edens bright;
IVhere in secret emerald bowers
Grows the wild clematis white.

“R.H.C. ” : In discus-
sion of the recent bush fires,
I notice no mention of light-
ning as a probable cause.
While staying at Mr. George
Cruickshank’s Gunningrah
station, a heavy thunder-
storm occurred (10th Jan.)
An old hand was watching
the storm, when he observed
one flash of lightning abso-
lutely “lick ’’The plain ; im-
mediately smoke rose. Word
was sent post haste to the
station to give the alarm.
Bain immediately began to
fall (total fall 32 points).
When Mr. Cruick-
shank and others ar-
rived on the scene
they found that 40
acres of grass had
been burnt, and
that the posts of
a wire fence were
still burning. Opi-
nion differs as to
whether the grass
itself was struck
or a post. A selec-
tor adjoining,
from his cottage
door saw the light-
ning strike a tree, run
down and set fire to the
grass. He lost an acre
of grass. It was chain
lightning. Up to the
time of setting fire to
the grass no rain had
fallen.

“ C.N.” re dugong : At the Melbourne Ex-
hibition of 1881, a Queensland co. sent tinned
soups—dugong, beche-de-mer, and turtle ; and the
old world experts who were gathered in Mel-
bourne at that time pronounced dugong the best
of the lot. It might be a good time for some
enterprising capitalist to consider the revival of
dugong soup for gourmets.

“Flabby Paul”: Re “ Werrimee ” (8.,
6/10/ , 04), as to squatters owning to the edge of
the water in a river or to the centre. In Queens-
land, if you are only taking a 20-acre block on
a river bank, there is always an esplanade re-
served, not less than 1| chains wide. This also
applies to creeks, sea-shores, and railways.

“ Lameah ” : Up North the red gum of
the woolly-butt is used as a makeshift astringent
in severe cases of diarrhoea. The juices from the
rind of a common pumpkin and native aloe are
also used instead of collodion. Pumpkin juice
dries quicker than the real thing and does not
smart, while the pith and seeds make a capital
sweetmeat, laxative and vermifuge; the juice is
also a passable cement; while the boiled syrup of
the vegetable often passes as a malt extract. An
infusion of Leichhardt pine-chips is said to be
useful in consumption.
“P.X.”: The value of goat’s
meat as food is being discussed, apropos
the new attempt to put the angora on
his feet in Australia. The S.M. Herald
on-the-land man writes that “the Aus-
tralian people will never eat goat-meat
when they can get mutton and lamb.’’
An .enthusiastic angora - experimenter
replies that “angora venison is just
the thing to provide the extra variety
of meat food the human race has long
searched for.” Don’t know anything
about “ angora venison,” but thousands
of people have paid for and eaten the
garden variety of goat-meat and thought
it was lamb or mutton. Pretty well
every mining camp has a flock of semi-
wild goats m its neighborhood, and
they are nearly always raided sooner
or later by an enterprising, fleet-footed
butcher when the sheep supply is scarce.
Was travelling once with the latelv-
deceased Nicholas Sadleir, who had
been breeding and eating mutton for
about half a century. At an accom-
modation house we had what he said
(we were hungry, certainly) was the
best leg of mutton he had met in those
droughty parts for a year or two.
Afterwards we learned it was goat.
The length of tail and the absence of
fat sometimes give nanny or billy away.
If the goat would leave off browsing on
old boots and suppress his taste for
discarded underclothing, most of the
prejudice against goat’s meat would
disappear. Perhaps that is why he
goes on cultivating those tastes.

“Ed.”: “Tom Collins,” in liis
“Such is Life,” remarks casually on
the “r-r-r” of theyabbie. Have asked
numbers of bush folk of a night, but
none could place the sound. All dis.
missed it as “ crickets.” Brer yabbie is the owner
of a fine ’cello apparatus. A rasping edge of one
joint of claw playing on the sharp edge of another
edge gives a clear note, especially played, as he
does it, under water. It is one of the cheeriest of
bush sounds; the note of some of them is quite
musical.
“Jimmie Pannikin” : This is the prayer
of a grilled and gritty grafter, Past-Sunset—
“ Work till the end of life and life till the end of
work.” To the words of Uppingham Thring’s, he
adds—“ And The Bulletin 52 times every year.”

The Gippslander in some localities has
great trouble with the dogwood and wattle scrub
and the bracken ferns. When the bush was in its
primeval wildness, of blackbutt and white and blue
fums, light woods grew up, slim and straight and
ranchless in the lower parts, struggling with sure
but slow persistency for the glorious prize of sun-
light. Then an odd wattle or dogwood lived here
and there in the semi-darkness below. The
brackens were very scant. Now the giants of the
scrub have been destroyed. The dogwood scrub
made little appearance until the settlers began to
burn off. Then fires scorched the ground and
germinated the seed. The ferns grew everywhere
as soon as the forest was down and sunlight shone
uninterruptedly upon the ground. This is one of
the disappointments of going on the land in
Grippsland. When one scrub is down another
grows, and finally there is a never-to-be-conquered
enemy in the bracken.

“Kwaipan” (Woodlark Island) tells a
story which throws doubt on the wisdom of
striving to spread education around :
Some traders in New Guinea have great ideas of the
capacity of the native brain. A trader up this way had a
good boy who could shoot well with the gun, wash a dish
for gold, and fix up a box or sluice race. So he thought
he would teach him how to shoot fish with dynamite.
He fired a couple of plugs himself, and explained things
carefully to the boy. Then, for the test, he fixed a nine-
inch fuse in a plug, and handed it and a fire-stick to the
boy. The boy took them, and, after lighting the fuse,
stood like a statue. “ Throw it away,” said the trader ;
but the boy understood not. “ Throw it away ! ” re-
peated the trader, as he started backing away from the
boy ; but again the native failed to understand. He how-
ever saw his boss backing away, so started to follow him,
until the trader, with a yell, took to his heels, shrieking
“ Throw it away, you damned fool ! ” The white man
ran as if possessed, but the boy followed doggedly ; but
as he ran dropped the plug and fuse. A second after it
fell, it exploded just behind the boy, and he flew past the
white man like a shot. That trader has changed his
opinion as to the mental qualities of the New Guinea boys.

wards, tails upwards, looking like a bunch of

the mud.

When Bill starts walking out with Kate, I thought I’d

About the only natural water supply at
Clermont (Q.) consists of a lagoon, considerately
placed by Nature in the centre of the town.
Bathing in this precious sheet of water is, of
course, prohibited. On one memorable occasion
a fiery colonel of the Defence Forces met an
equally fiery enemy on a bridge crossing the
lagoon, and, after a struggle, the warrior was cast
into the waterhole. To render his degradation
complete, he was forthwith proceeded against by
the local authorities and fined, for polluting the
town water supply. His indignant protest that a
colonel wasn’t a microbe or a disease passed quite
unheeded.

LIVE SHELLS AT JERVIS BAY. N
A Caution to Small Boys.
Admiral Fanshawe has reported to the State
Governor that the captain of the Challenger,
having conducted a searcli for projectiles ashore at
Jervis Bay, lias discovered that a space one mile by
two miles broad may now be considered free from
live shell, though there may possibly be one or two
stray shells on other parts of the bay, search for which would be a
matter of great difficulty. The Admiral hopes there will lie no
possibility ui accidents occurring in the future.
ONLY A LITTLE ONE, BUT
Govt. Statist Cdghian
figiires out on his little

proves that there is some-

SHELLS OF THE OCEAN.
On* evening as, in pensive thought,
They wandered by a sea-beat shore,
They gathered shells—some charged with shot,
And now they gather shells no more !
Last week, “ from information ra
saived ” by wire, a posse of Sydney
police hurried away to Moss Vale
The Man in the Street asked
himself “ What for ? ” naturally,
and Rumor had a busy day. One report hinted that the
1 antanoola tiger had got after the Governor, and was chaemw
him round and round the “ Gib.” “
“ This,” said the Czar, as the Court Surgeon picked
small bits of metal out of his Majesty’s throne and
person, “ this comes of being popular. What other
nation would expend anything but blank charges in
saluting their Sovereign?”
“WE ARE TURNING THE CORNER.”
Thus spake Joey Carruthers. Pawnshops are
generally “ round a corner.”
Another rumor had it that the Baltic
fleet was approaching Moss Vale over-
land and was threatening Government
House, to the great indignation of his
Ex.’s private secretary.

Later on Rumor had it that a band of bushrangers
Had turned up at Government House, and got “into
s ' v itli the Gov.’s aide-de-camp because they
reused to sign their names in the visitors’ book.
The report that an anarchist had been
seen in the vicinity of the vice-regal t
residence, with a live bomb, had no
better foundation than a party who had
lost himself on his way home from a
.game of bowls.
A false report that a
Man had been found
under the Vice regal bed
was traced to a woman’s
political club.
lt finally transpired that
the police were sent for to give safe convoy to
Cohen and his pawn-tickets— Cohen’s visit
having some relation to a recent Government
loan.

STORY OF OUR SHOES
WE did not set out in Shoes before we could
walk. We were some years handling every-
thing else a man wears—didn’t look down at
his shoes until we were ready. First we had to
make the dollars —they talked to the Shoe-
maker and told him to make us shoes
that would walk over all competition.
That meant a mighty big stride—a
real seven leaguer.
, First League— Tanning the leather slowly
and surely from the pick of the hides, leather
with all that pinch and sting taken out of it.
Second— Finishing by the specialist in each
sort—Vici finish for Kid ; Willow for Tan
Calf; French, Box, and Crupp for Black
Calf; Patent Glace; Oil Grain for
strong, damp-proof boots. Third—
Shaping after the best shoe archi-
tecture. Fourth— Constructing in

A True Story of Russia.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
is the story, somewhat old in years, but
now first printed, of the mission of a
- Sydney Quaker, Joseph James Neave, who
felt “called by God” to a service, and under-
took and accomplished it most wonderfully. In
the simple »ud fervent faith of the Quakers, the
belief in a God who keeps an overguarding eye on
mortals is still real. Statementof that fact is needed
to explain Mr. Neave’s story, which, long buried in
his breast, was brought to light in Sydney some
months ago, when there visited the city the Rev.
Francis, once chaplain to the American Embassy
at St. Petersburg. It was not of the Quaker
character to seek blare of newspaper trumpets ;
else would Mr. Neave, returning from his mission
to Russia, have been a nine days wonder in Aus-
tralia. Nor is it of that character to refuse to
the public facts, knowledge of which “may
work for the good,” as Mr. Neave put it. So here
is, at last, his story :
“ Thou must know, friend, that we Quakers are
brought up in the faith of the Divine Presence
being always around us to guide and teach. Often
we feel the secret drawing of the Spirit of God
within us to do His work. But sometimes Satan
plausibly leads us astray by persuading us to
engage in some other work to which we are not
called. Therein is a great snare, and I hope if thou
art called, thou wilt be favored to see it, for vain
is it to set the snare in the sight of any bird. God,
however, was most good to me, inasmuch as my
call was made very plain and clear. I was in
Hobart with my wife, and one morning, while
watching by the sick bed of the head of the
Friends’ Sohool, who was exceeding ill and like to
die, I was moved to read the 47th Psalm, which
concludes : ‘ The shields of the earth belong unto
God. He is greatly exalted.’
“I closed the Book. Then there came over
me that which I cannot understand, and cannot
well tell of. Was it a vision? I know not. But
I of a sudden had a manner of second sight or
sense— a feeling —which enabled me to see and re-
cognise every true believer in the Lord Jesus
Christ the world over, and to observe how God
watched over and protected them. As I dwelt
under this feeling a voice cried out in my ears, as
clear as any human voice: ‘ Thou must go to
Russia ! ’ and I saw that the Stundists were being
persecuted there, and I knew the meaning of the
Voice.
“Nay, friend, I had not thought of Russia ere
the call, though I had heard before then of the
Stundists. Rather had I frequently thanked God
that He had not seen fit to take me from my
peaceful home, and send me on work to danger-
ous foreign lands. And when I heard the Voice I
fell into a great trembling from head to foot, and
cried, ‘lt is impossible; it cannot be!’ Yet the
call haunted me persistently, so that I at length
concluded to hand myself back entirely into the
Lord’s hands, and said : * If Thou wilt go with me
and before me, I shall go to the ends of the earth,
if that be Thy will.’ Then I had rest. Later, I
remembered, as thou wilt remember, the message
sent unto Ahaz : ‘Ask thou a sign of the Lord thy
God ! ’ And it was borne to me that if the sick
Friend with whom I watched should not die, the
Lord, of a truth, would require me to go to Russia.
From that moment the sick Friend speedily got
well.
“ Thereupon I wrote to Friends in England and
laid the matter before them, seeing that I had no
private means wherewith I might obey the call.
They, however, urged me to address myself to
my Australian work, and this counsel I followed,
knowing well that the Lord in His own good time
would open a way for me. And so at length it
came to pass. Two years after I was in Welling-
ton (M.L.), engaged upon a mission there, when a
letter came to me from England, which informed
me that a Friend whom I had not seen for 20 years
(and when last I saw her she was very poor) had died,
bequeathing me £2OO, which sum the Lord had
moved her to specially bind her executors to pay
me forthwith, without awaiting legal forms and
ceremonies.
“I saw clearly what this meant. I cried out,
‘ Suffer me, O Lord, to bid farewell to those in my
house at Sydney ! ’ Nevertheless, the Spirit drew
me irresistibly to England, and, without ventur-
ing to see my wife, thither I proceeded straight
away, and laid my concern before a meeting of
the Friends. It being too weighty a matter for
any but the Ministry and Oversight meeting to
decide upon, I went at length to London to meet
that body. Thou must know, friend, that if, at such
a meeting, the Friends believe a ‘call’ to be a
true one, they furnish the Friend ‘ called ’ with a
message of approval and unity, and with funds
for the needs of his journey. On the day, a
great concourse having assembled at the meeting,
soon after we had gathered into silence a weighty
covering fell upon us all. Then I, rising at last,
told the Friends exactly what I have told thee,
friend, to-day—no more, no less. And the Lord
willed that the Friends, one after another, got up,
and proclaimed unity and sympathy and en-
couragement ; and I was set free to go upon God’s
service.
“A little while afterwards a Friend, John Bel-
lows, whom thou wilt mayhap know of as a learned
and good man, a notable linguist, archaeologist and
scientist, and the compiler of the great French
Dictionary, wrote to me in such words as these :
‘ When Edward Rawsome mentioned in a letter
I had from him thy call to Russia, a vivid sense
came to me that it might be required of me to offer
to go with thee. The Enemy has not failed to set
before me that if I should be so required I should
seek to put it by me as a hard thing. Yet if thou
art clear, and if Friends are fully of the mind it
would be suitable for thee to accept my company,
then I shall go with thee.’ When I received this
letter I knew that I was as a little boy sent from
a great distance to open the door for the right man
to go through, and I rejoiced. The Friends
heartily accepted for me the companionship of
John Bellows, and we two left for Russia.
“ Before we set out upon our journey we had at
first intended to arm ourselves with introductions
to the British Ambassador at St. Petersburg (an
easy thing for the great John Bellows to procure)
and to others. But we finally resolved not to
rely upon the arm of flesh, and so it came that
we reached the capital of Russia leaning only
on the Lord. Our faith was wonderfully re-
warded. The Lord went with us and before
us and prepared the way for us. From the
station we drove in a straight line along the
A PROUD SOUL.
STEVE: “ Yah, got yer wet —cinnamon rock—heaps of it."
PETEE : “Pooh! Dicken to you —I goiter boil!”
cobbled road to the Square of Isaac’s Cathe-
dral, thence to an hotel which fills a large block on
one side of the Square, 27 windows long. There
we met presently an English pastor, Mr. Francis,
a kind man, to whom we explained our mission.
Yet all his kindness did not suffer him to give us
anything of encouragement or hope. At that
time the persecution of all religious bodies dissent-
ing from the established Greek Church was at its
height. The Lutherans in the Baltic provinces,
and the Roman Catholics in Poland, were being
very cruelly used, but the Stundists suffered more
than any other sect. They, as doubtless thou
lcnowest, friend, had incurred the special hatred
of the Established Church, of which the Emperor
is head on earth, because they had sundered and
broken from that body. The poor Stundists were
therefore regarded as dangerous schismatics, and
dreadful was their punishment. Wherever found
they were seized and sent, chained with the
lowest criminals, into exile to the Caucasus;
obliged to march across the snow-covered steppes—
men, women, and little children, sometimes 1500,
sometimes 20e0 miles.
“We, learning the truth of all these things,
spent three days in our hotel, waiting on God in
prayer. Then it was borne to us that we should
call upon M. Pobedonostzeff, the Chief Procurator
of the Holy Synod, the prime enemy of the
Stundists. Pastor Francis endeavored to move
us from our intention, warning us that we should
be ordered over the frontier forthwith, and that it
was madness to thus attack the enemy in his
citadel. But John Bellows replied to him :
‘ Then, friend, we have either mistaken our
mission, or it has been already mysteriously
accomplished ! ’
“ Whereupon Pastor Francis said no more,
except to call us ‘ dreamers of dreams.’
“The Lord willed that we were to meet M.
Pobedonostzeff near his own door ; though we
knew it not at the time. We met a man
before his palace, about to drive away, who asked
our business. I replied, as was my custom, ‘We
have come from the Lord ! ’ Afterwards, we
knew that the Lord must have shaped my words,
for no one could have said anything to more
powerfully and immediately enlist the attention
of a Russian. For the nature of the Russian is
mystic and impressionable. They believe pro-
foundly in God, and they even expect God to
speak directly to men, and to appoint the faithful
to His tasks. It is a touching and most beautiful
belief, for which Friends love the Russians well.
“M. Pobedonostzeff —for he it was—immediately
invited us within his home, and there long con-
versed with us. He seemed to me a sincere man,
and, if intolerant, he nevertheless justified his
actions by the law. To all our entreaties he
replied that in persecuting the Stundists, he'
obeyed his Master, and he would by no means
promise to abate the system; yet he gave us,
departing, a card to Prince Canta Cazene, the
Minister of Foreign Religions, who kindly intro-
duced us to the ruling classes in St. Petersburg.
To all we met we spoke freely of our call, and we
advanced daily into the affections of the foremost
men in Russia. Truly, the Lord protected and
watched over us. When the time was ripe we
wrote a private and most searching letter to the
Czar, which we took to Count Worontzoff Dasch-
koff, a Minister of the Imperial Court who was a
personal friend of his Majesty. The Count by
God’s grace allowed us to seal this missive before
it parted from our hands, and lie afterwards
delivered it unread and unopened to his Imperial
master —a thing lam told had never happened,
till then, in Russia; for Ministers oversee all
letters presented them, and, if they think it right,
withhold them from the Emperor’s intelligence.
Some days after, the Czar showed this letter to the
Chief Procurator of the Holy Synod, who read it
and said : ‘ The men are fools ! ’ but the Czar put
the letter back into his pocket and said no word.
This I have from a lady in the household of M.
Pobedonostzeff —so I know it to be true.
“ Thus was the first part of our mission accom-
plished. Throughout we walked entirely by the
inner leading of the Spirit. In no case did we
enter the presence of any of the officials with any
preparation as to what we were to say, but in each
case the Master literally fulfilled His promise in
Matthew x., 18-19. * Who is blind is the Lord’s ser-
vant ? ’ was our watchword ; so we moved through
all entanglements. It was not our work. Our share
in it was as the share of a child who has pulled a
thread to fire a great gun. A soldier had loaded
it and ordered the child to pull the thread, and
the gun was fired—yet not by the child certainly.
“Afterwards it shaped itself to us that we ought
to go to the Trans-Caucasus, where the exiled
Stundists were. We learned that the Czar
believed the Stundists to be disloyal to his
government; and we thought that if he were
assured to the contrary, he might cease to perse-
cute them the more readily.
“We told what we wished to the British
Ambassador, who said to us it was not possible.
Such a thing had never been heard of. But the
Lord opened the way for us again as so many
times before. We were bidden to dine one even-
ing at the house of the head of the Secret Police ;
and he questioned us of our intention. He sought
to frighten us at first, but perceiving that the
Lord had driven fear from our hearts, said no
more. Later, we discovered that his wife was,
secretly, a Stundist, and that he, Prince and
Minister as he Avas, feared in his heart to be
betrayed and exiled for concealing the fact of her
denial of the Greek Church. Thus by no power
on our part, except the Faith within us, were we
carried on and over the length of the Lord’s re-
quirements.
“ In the month of December we set out for the
Trans-Caucasus, and were absent from St. Peters-
burg for more than three months. Concerning
that long and fearful journey, a full account of
which Avould fill a large volume, I shall say but
this : The Lord throughout went with us and
before us, opening our way and shielding us. By
the Czar’s orders, we met with no obstructions ;
rather everywhere help and encouragement to
properly complete our task. We travelled all the
Trans-Caucasus and Southern Russia, and walked
about among many wild and savage people,
steeped in lawlessness and violent crimes. Yet
no hand was raised against us, and, though we
suffered greatly from the intense cold, we were
even permitted to retain our health and strength
inviolate. We discovered, as we expected, that
flic Czar had no more loyal subjects than the
Stundists. _ They all denied that there was any-
thing political in their persecution, and their
answer to our most important question always
took this form : ‘We know the Emperor is ignor-
ant of hovv we are treated. If he knew, he Avould
not allow it.’ And they were treated shamefully.
Indeed, it was evident that they had been exiled
to that awful country by their persecutors, in the
hope that they would speedily sink to death
beneath the cruel hardships they were forced to
undergo. They Avere, in most cases, left among
savage tribes, to starve or be killed, and those who
survived only clung to life through the kindness of
foreign friends, who employed hawkers to go
among them to distribute secretly at intervals
enough food to keep them in existence.
“We returned to St. Petersburg by way of the
Black Sea and Batoum. We were almost at once
informed by the good Count Worontzoff Daschkoff
that we might have private audience of the Czar,
but, learning that the interview could at most be
prolonged to the extent of a few minutes, we
denied ourselves the visit. We chose rather to
confide all that we had discovered and the things
we wished to bring to pass to a more enduring
memorial than words. Therefore we wrote out a
long report, which we entrusted to the Count, who
promised to convey it to his master. And then
we bade farewell to St. Petersburg, and set out
for our distant homes.
“ And now, friend, I come to the end of my
long story, a thing which doubtless will not sadden
thee. Having arrived in England, I returned
thence as soon as might he to my Sydney home —
and here I rest me now. Many years have passed
since then—yet it was not vouchsafed me by the
Lord until quite recently to learn, for a very cer-
tainty, that our mission had materially bettered
the condition of the Stundists, though I had ever
hoped and prayed. Conceive, therefore, how
deeply I rejoiced to meet here, a little time ago.
Pastor Francis, who had befriended us in the
Russian capital, and the more especially because
he speedily made known to me the fruit of our
researches and our labors in God’s calling. From
the day that onr report was presented to the Czar
the Stundist persecutions ceased. No more were
exiled, and although now and again men were
treated badly in their villages by the fanatic Greek
priests, the offenders, by the Czar’s orders, were
always punished, when reported.
“Thus thou seest, friend, the Lord has blessed
me in my mission to the uttermost.”
That is Neave’s story wonderful in its
revealing of simple and utter faith in the
missioners, more wonderful, perhaps, in the light
it throws on the mystic and gentle side of the
character of the Russian—the Slav who, as the
guerdon of his championship of the white races,
is now so much represented as a cruel and blood-
thirsty tyrant.

Victorian M.L.A. T. Hunt complained
the other day that he had been asked to subscribe
to 100 racing and sporting clubs in his electorate.
Members of Parliament have only themselves to
blame when they are thus disgracefully black-
mailed. It would be an easy matter to pass an
Act making it an offence to solicit or accept from
an M.P. a gift for the benefit of any institution or
person within his electorate.
AT THE GATE.
MONKEY : “ What? Ain’t you going to resign
now? I’ve smashed your back gate!”
BEAR: “No!”
MONKEY: “Dash it. I thought it teas all over
except the shouting.”
A suburban ex-M.L.A. is negotiating for
the purchase of a small newsagency, up Surry
Hills way. “Bit of a come-down for you,” said
the proprietor. “ A change, certainly, ” said the
rejected orator. “ I’ve often made the stuff that
sold their papers, now I’ll have to sell the papers
to make the stuff.” ;
Bent and Taverner both claim that they
have “ got off clear ” in the Taverner Inquiry, and
Bent is hurrying Taverner off to London again as
Agent-General. Nothing is said about Justice
A’Beckett’s attitude as to Taverner’s attempted
explanation of the “See-those-Manchester-people,”
letters, and his acceptance of Sinclair’s evidence
against Taverner. Also, Bent is keeping quiet
over A’Beckett’s finding that Sinclair would have
done his work in London well, if Taverner had
not recalled him.
The United States (“ in calling the United
States ‘America,’ we only anticipate a little,”
remarked an influential Yankee paper the other
day) proposes to go further on the path of shipping
protection. Already the shipping trade between
one U.S.A. port and another is absolutely secured
to the American-owned vessel. Now a grasp is to
be made at the deep-sea shipping with special
subsidies for American-owned and manned boats,
and special taxes on foreign vessels. The ship-
owner is to pay in part for this Protection by
helping to form a naval volunteer force.
The opponents of socialistic legialation
have pointed many a scornful finger at the pro-
vision of M.L. Arbitration Act which exempts the
Government from the Act’s provisions. Premier
Seddon has at last been made to see the force of
the objection, and publishes his intention to make
the State coal mines subject to the Act.
Wellington Evening Post, in an article on
the fall of Port Arthur :
No time should be lost, and no effort should be spared,
in impressing upon the statesmen of Great Britain that
Australasia intends to remain white, and would as soon
be handed over bodily to Germany or Russia as be sub-
jected to the treatment which has been meted out to the
Transvaal. Where would the Empire be if the spirit of
the Transvaal Labor Ordinance found another incarnation
in a new treaty with Japan after she has vanquished
Russia ?
Melb. Argus has been landing itself some
heavy blows lately. The “Freetrade” organ
recently published a leader which stated the
obvious truth that “the only safeguard against
the recurrence of the unemployed difficulty was in
providing a diversity of employment.” But after
meandering gently down a column, the difficulty
of providing said employment whilst importing
the simplest manufactures was passed by on the
other side.
Sydney D.T., after elaborately stating
that N.S. W.’s Joseph, as a Reform Premier, is a
sloshy failure, calls upon Rous constituency to
return at the coming by-election a candidate
pledged to Joseph Platitude. The poor old D.T.
has been put into a hard position by its frenzied
Toryism ; neither of its Josses, George nor Joseph,
will follow its lead ; but it can t break with either
definitely, for no one else offers to lead against the
Labor party.
, Q- Agent-General Tozer, with a wave of
his hand and an airy remark that the time is not
ripe (good old ripe), has explained that any at-
tempt to consolidate the debts of the Australian
States into a Commonwealth issue would result in
disaster. Tozer is no doubt quite aware that if
Federal action deprived him of the occupation of
hanging round Uncle Cohen’s door whenever
Bananaland’s I O U's fell in, his whole billet
would probably vanish.
Gillespie, brass plate expert, and ex-
president of the Kyabram League, whom Bent
appointed to the Closer Settlement Board, was
round the Government offices all the week prior
to his job being gazetted. Nobody ever regarded
him as a “possible.” Even the stoutest Kyabrain-
ites reckoned such a thing “too strong” ; and it
was supposed that he was merely anxious to see
that somebody was appointed who would look
after the rights of Capital.
The harmful effect of the Tobacco Trust is
already seen in the falling-off of Victoria’s pro-
duction of tobacco leaf, which has dropped from
600 tons in 1903 to 130 tons in 1904. There is none
of that “healthy competition ” that Fatnmn says
he is so fond of, to keep up prices for the grower;
the Trust just offers what it likes, and the grower
must either (1) accept that, or (2) export his crop
to compete against the cheap nigger labor of other
countries, or (3) go into some other business.
The British General Federation of Trades
Unions has been discussing the pressing unem-
ployed problem in England, and has decided
that the number of unemployed may be greatly
reduced by the regulation of industry, maintain-
ing work at an even level; also, by an intelli-
gent anticipation of bad conditions of trade and
the construction of works of public utility.
Which is as a poor bit of fluff trying to
stem a torrent. The unemployed are grow-
ing in England because its factories and
lands are fast being locked-up—in the first
case by foreign competition, against which
there is no Protection; in the second
by the monopoly of great areas for sheep
walks and deer walks. Something more than
“an intelligent anticipation of bad conditions of
trade ” is wanted for the situation.
S.M. Herald at last wakes up to print
this fact in its leading columns :
It must be evident to everyone that, if we are to defend
ourselves, we must be in a position to provide our ow’n
weapons of defence, without being completely dependent
on outside sources of supply. We may find those supplies
cut off at the time w'hen w'e most need them.
This would have been “evident to everyone” a
generation, at least, ago, had not Granny jambed
her umbrella in the eye of everyone who dared to
express Protectionist views.
In Queensland Leg. Council, the other
day, Thynne objected to postmasters being
entrusted with State electoral work, because one
never knew when “members of that Chamber
might lead a secession movement.” To which all
the Dodderers said “ Hear, hear ” joyfully. The
Bulletin would joyfully welcome the appearance
of Thynne at the head of the Queensland Fossils
leading a secesh movement, and will undertake to
provide them with guns and ammunition for one
month when they are ready to start.
“A leading Melbourne business man,”
returned, the other day, from a trip abroad, told
the Age something about that expensive concern,
Victoria’s London Agent-General’s department:—
The first thing- that struck my eye was the great show-
window. Its contents reminded me of the stock-in-trade
displayed in the window of some petty little shop in a
back lane of one of the poorest Melb. suburbs. There was
a tin of biscuits from a Melbourne firm, with its label
yellow, dry,, and powdery with age. There were two or
three tins of a Melbourne jam in much the same con-
dition ; three little trays of Mildura dried fruits that
■ looked venerable enough to have been among the first
products of the settlement ; a handful of crumbly oats
and wheat in the stalk, and a few odds and ends, speckled,
dirty, and forbidding- like the rest. How different the
splendidly-arranged, fresh, clean and well-tended collec-
tion of samples in the window of the Canadian depot!
The Federal Committee on the tobacco
monopoly was taking evidence from the Octopus
on the question of the quality of the stuff where
the State runs the business. It was vile, of
course. The point had been particularly stressed
in the Octopus’ pamphlet, “Objections to a
Federal Tobacco Monopoly,” and the Octopus
said it was all true —especially that the sweepings
of the factory floors are used in French cigars,
which was horrid ! Then some unfeeling brute of
a committee man asked the Octopus what it did
with its own sweepings; and, after much humming
and consulting, the Octopus had to admit that the
leaf which falls to the floor when it makes cigars
is used too, just as it is used in the awful French
cigars. Ail that the Octopus could say by way of
a crawl-out was that of course its floors were very
clean floors. But it needn’t have explained that,
for the Collingwood gentleman in the cigar factory
is notoriously supersensitive on the question of
dirt.
GENUINELY A PLEASURE.

From the crop liens record in a Queensland
mercantile gazette it would appear that a good

mortgaged to Adrahamann .Tullendeer and Dade-
villi, to Mulung Khan, likewise to Sobar Khan.
The White Australia policy doesn’t advance too
rapidly.
An Argonaut (’Frisco) special on the
Russians :
I have heard and read a great deal about “revolution
in Russia ” since the war began. If there is to be any re-
volution in Russia, it is my belief that it will “ come from
above” —in short, be a palace revolution, as most Russian
revolutions have been. The masses, to a superficial
observer, present the utmost solidarity. They seem to
me to be almost homogeneous. They have simple, child-
like faces, and they repose a simple, child-like faith in
their priests and in their Czar. This vast mass of
humanity seems to me utterly unaffected by exterior in-
fluences. There is no European city which show's so little
trace of outlanders and outlandism as St. Petersburg.
Melbourne Argus, the other day, inter-
viewed Canada’s Commercial Agent, D. H. Ross,
on immigration, and he put the gospel of increased
population in four w'ords: “Believe in your
country ! ” That is what the foreign-loving,
nigger-loving Argus has never done. But it is
the true panacea. Believe in your country ! Trust
to yourselves that you can make any article any-
one else can make ; that you can produce most
things you need without any help from any
foreigner. Make Australia a clean, wholesome,
liighly-Protected, high-wage land for your own
white selves, and you will speedily get the popu-
lation.
Perth mafficked as madly as any of them ;
but the Chow’-miner end of it all has hit Wes-
tralians where they live, so there was a very
different sort of demonstration when the jubilee of
Eureka was celebrated. It was the biggest thing
of the kind since the maffick days ; 15,000 or
20,000 people listening to massed bands playing
“The Marseillaise,” with never a bar of the
“Bullocky Breed,” or “Rule Britannia.” And
the flag was the flag of Australia—not the flag
under which the Jews stamped out tw'o brave little
republics in the cause of cheap colored labor.
Wreckage of the barque Brier Holme, an
overdue Tasmanian trader, was discovered in the
vicinity of Port Davey recently. That part of the
coast is wdld, inhospitable, uninhabited, and offers
no sustenance to castaways. The crew' of the
Brier Holme had many friends in Tasmania. But
for some days the Government declined (and only
at last reluctantly consented) to send out a rescue
steamer, urging, in reply to remonstrances, that
to send the steamer would cost £5O. That is a fair
specimen of- Tasmanian Government s idea of
economy. ’lt has also struck the brilliant idea of
not having-reliable reports made of the evidence
given to Royal Commissions, urging that short-
hand writers cost money. Thus the work of all
Commissions appointed has no trustworthy record.
“Abolish it!” all the Tory papers are
shrieking as to the N.S.W. Arbitration Act.
“ Here’s a strike which it hasn’t prevented.
What’s the use of it ? Off with its head ! ” Then
The Bulletin’s eye roams down the Telegraph’s
column with the shriek in it, and finds a solicitor
called a “solocitor,” and the Arbitration Court
spelled “Cort”; wherefore it’s The Bulletin’s
turn to yell—“ Here are two mistakes w'hich the
proof-reader hasn't prevented. What’s the use of
a proof-reader ? Off with his head ! ” Also, it
draws the S.M. Herald’s attention to the fact
that w'ithin the last few months three smothered
infants have been found in bags; a man kicked to
death in a Sydney suburb, and two bushmen found
with their heads battered in. Five murders which
the law against murder hasn’t either prevented or
punished ! So what’s the use of it either ?
Anthony
Hordern’s im-
mense Sydney
shop is now near-
ing completion.
When N.S.W.
Arbitration
Court, some
months ago, gave
its award for the
factory made-to-
measure clothing
trade, a head in
Hordern’s firm,
in a D.T. inter-
view-, stated that
such legislation
was crippling the
State. As an in-
stance of the dire
effects of the
tailoring award
in particular, he
showed plans of
the buildings
now being fin-
ished, and stated
that that was
the original
building sememe,
but since the
award men-
tioned, it would
be impossible to
carry on on the
scale at first pro-
posed, and but
half the struc-
ture would go up
in consequence.
Now the build-
ings, on the origi-
nal plan, are al-
most completed.
And yet the
Arbitration Act
Still stands.
Thank Heaven
for the small mercy
of one banking person
who writes to the Argus
and doesn’t mention social-
istic legislation as the reason
why Australia is in the dumps.
Mr. R. J. Dent, who describes
himself as “a director of a London bank doing
business in the East,” puts it this way ;4-
I can assure you that the imposition of charges for
keeping banking accounts by the Australian banks was
the talk of every banking board of directors in London.
We all looked upon the step as the last straw which broke
the back of Australian credit at home. The insurance
companies soon took this view, and withdrew in a short
time millions they had invested in Australia.
It’s about up to some socialistic.person now to talk
seriously to all the bank directors and ask what
they mean by scaring capital out of the country
in this way.
A gem from “ Arbitration on Trial,” leader
in Hobart Mercury -
Unless the Arbitration Act be so altered as to give em-
ployers the right to whip their men, we cannot see how
this enforced labor is to be of any use. It is a dreadful
thing even to suppose such a power being placed in the
hands of employers, but it is the logical conclusion of
what now exists.
N.S.W. Railway Com-
missioners expect some-
thing of a demand for the
old cable cars, since they
are found useful as sum-
mer-houses, bathing-sheds,
and, at a pinch, house-boats.

ECONOMY.
Perhaps even an embryo Federal Capital might be
started with a dozen or so of these cast-off cars.
Owing to the stoppage of the recruiting of
Kanakas, various “ black-birding ” vessels are for
sale up north. Noticeable on some of these a
number of strong staples driven into the sides of
’tw r een decks, to restrain “ willing ” boys from
jumping overboard when freshly captured.

A certain much-talked-of Victorian poli-
tician probably is contemplating further matri-
mony. The other day he presented himself
for cleansing purposes at the Turkish Baths, Royal
Arcade (Melb.), and judging from the longtime
he dallied in the hottest innermost room one
would naturally suspect him of an intention to fine
himself down to an ardent Romeo figure. The
stout man was graciously pleased to approve of the
new Baths. Whilst breathing heavily on the slab,
he remarked that Melbourne ought to be proud of
them, or words to that effect. *
Mr. J. E. HOISLEY, Proprietor of the Halsey
House, New Holland, Ohio, writes: “I had a severe
attack of LA GRIPPE. It ran into PNEUMONIA.
Doctors failed to give me relief. I became so weak that I
could not turn in bed. Finally my wife got a bottle of
Jayne’s Expectorant. Before I had used one half of it my
Cough was easier, and I was soon restored. I have no
hesitation in saving that JAYNE’S EXPECTORANT
SAVED MY LIFE.”*
THE SACRED RIGHTS OF CAPITAL!
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I search in vain the daily press
To find a martial lay
That might be set with some success
For brazen bands to play—
Some Barnyard Stripling madrigal
To sing in language gay
The Sacred Right of Capital
To have and hold the sway !
It is the right—though Demos scowls—
Of citizens of worth
To own the surface and the bowels
Of God Almighty’s earth !
And no mere laboring animal
May venture to gainsay
The Sacred Right of Capital
To fix its rate of pay !
’Tis Capital that owns the land,
The forest and the heath,
The air, the sea, the planets and
All things that lie beneath !
Who date deny, who can or shall,
If men should sulk or shirk,
The Sacred Right of Capital
To flog its slaves to work ?
Three cheers for Magna Charta and
The Habeas Corpus Act !
Three cheers for Liberty, so grand,
So safe, secure, compact 1
And God confound the radical
Who offers to deny
The sacred Right of Capital
To crush Humanity !

10th March, 1904.
Dear Sir,—l gladly bear my testimony to the efficiency
of the great Australian remedy, VITADATIO. I have
proved it personally as a wonderful cure for rheumatism
and lumbago, and I have also known it to cure kidney
trouble and very acute rheumatism in various forms. It
is doubtless, as stated, an invaluable blood purifier, and
requires only to be known to be widely used.
Believe me, yours very truly,
AGNES E. WESTON, L.L.D.

The Australian public will, no doubt, read with interest
the above testimonial from Miss Weston. Miss Weston’s
name is well-known all over the world as “The Sailors’
Friend," for the great interest which she takes in the
British navy and seafaring men. When such testimony
as the above is given, who can doubt the genuineness of
VITADATIO ?

The decline in the birth-rate has worked
its own cure. So many people wrote paragraphs
about it that incomes were increased, and now
Coghlan reports that things are coming right
again.
“Old Tom” : Here’s a cure that I have
found efficacious for toothache and neuralgia : Get
some turpentine and 10 pieces of flannel; heat one
pint of water, add one tablespoonful of turpentine,
dip a flannel in, wring lightly, and apply it to the
jaw ; change flannels every few seconds, and be
sure to have water as hot as can be possibly borne.
Within 20 minutes, even the ghost of neuralgia
will have melted away.
Respecting aboriginal marriages, E. M.
Curr, author of “ The Australian Race : its Origin,
Customs, &c.,” says:—
I consider Mr. John Bulmer, of Lake Tyers aboriginal
reserve, an excellent authority. Bulmer says the country
of this tribe is between the rivers Mitchell and Tambo and
the lakes into which they flow. When the whites first
entered Gippsland, in 1841, the native population may
have amounted to 1000 souls. Men used to marry women
of other tribes if unable to obtain as wives in their own
women unrelated to them. On this subject they were
very particular, even third cousins being within the pro-
hibited degress of relationship. Girls were often married
at 13. Of the Comet River natives girls have husbands at
12, and become mothers at 13 or thereabouts. Thoorgine
Island in 1849 was peopled by about 19 tribes, in all about
2000 souls. Originally they were quite naked. Girls be-
came wives at about 12 years and mothers at 13. This I
can bear out, 30 far as the tribes at or near Gympie are
concerned, where the girls were given in marriage on the
first signs of puberty.

Coonamble is so unstable that all the houses
there are built of wood ; no foundation can be
secured for brick buildings. A few miles from
Coonamble a little hill peers up from the dreary
flatness. It is reserved by the Government as a
ref*u;e in flood-time, and Coonamble fondly
alludes to it as Mount Magomadine. Stones are

Liver Complaint
Promptly Cured by Dr. Morse’s Indian Hoot
Pills.
“ Some time ago I suffered from headache and
biliousness,” says Mrs. E. Chapman, 24 Princess-
street, Sydney, “which finally ended in liver com-
plaint, so the doctors told me. I underwent treat-
ment from various ones, but no relief could I find.
My back got very bad, and finally I had to give
up work. At the same time I was very badly
affected with the various ailments that women are
subject to. I really began to give up all hope, and
felt that life was not worth living; but relief earne
when I was persuaded to take a course of Dr.
Morse’s Indian Root Pills ; from that hour I have
never been without them. I can say without fear
that they completely cured me, for I am now able
to work without trouble, regular in habits, and I
can confidently recommend them to all women
similiarly troubled, and I know there are hundreds.
I am only too glad to be able to give this testimony.
I may also state that my husband has derived great
benefit from taking the pills.”*

Mr. Francis Tozer, who died recently at Warr»
nambool (V.), was one of Australia’s oldest racing men*
At one time he always had a good ’chaser or hurdler in his
Stable. He also turned out a few smart jockeys from his
training quarters.
* •» * *
A country racing committee is investigating
what is alleged to be a turf swindle of an original charac-
ter. The owner entered two horseS) neither of which
was known to the locality. Two jockeys presented
themselves, and Were weighed out correctly ; but, when
the race started, only one horse made its appearance.
The other jockey and the other horse, if there was one,
got lost mysteriously on the way to the post. The
horse which started won, and the backers of the other
horse kicked so badly that the stewards are looking into
the matter. The allegation is that only one horse was on
the course, and he ran under the hame which best paid
the owner, according to the starting prices.

“ S.T.S.”: Par. in B. 29/12/’O4 makes fun of a

Whether a horse that fell in tt jumping race had been

BUicide to lose ! ” Well, the American magazine Outing
says that i11’1902 the New Orleans Jockey Club simply
caused its steeplechase course to be destroyed, so many
heavily-backed horses having fallen, and the club being
Convinced that they fell because they were backed.

“Dave H.R.”: Re “Lip” (8., 5/l/’O5) on a
Sydney barber who increases his earnings by a little horse
faking. I knew a doctor in N.Q., who followed the same
business, and could, in a few hours, transform a grey
horse into a vermilion, or cerise, or bay, or any other
color the owner desired. He was known to all the
“cronk” horse fraternity; but never one of them at-
tempted to “split" on him. If one had it would have
been certain death for him. The “horsey” man holds
anything like that dearer than gold, wife, or life itself,
and would have to be either garrulously drunk or in-
sane before he gave any such secrets publicity.

Punters generally have been experiencing a
good time at horse meetings in and about Sydney for
some months past, and if Mo. didn’t actually lose on
every occasion the balance in his favor must have been
very small, but this condition of things came to an abrupt
termination at Rosehill Saturday last, when not a single
first favorite won. A couple of the successful nags—High
Collar(GranvilleStakes)andSpero(Carlingford Mile) —came
from one stable, and proved complete “skinners” for
most of the books. Metal Lace never looked a loser from
end to end of the big event (Rosehill Handicap), spite of
the fact that, two weeks before at Warwick Farm, he
finished nearer last than first. Jockey W. H. Smith rode
three of the six winners.

A well-known Chinese gambling-house in Ade-

enterprising European transferred the necessary “ marks ”
from one ticket on to another, and the highest prize was
handed over to him. When the rightful winner came
along, the lottery proprietors were forced to pay over
again, and they decided that the game was not profitable
enough when such things could happen, and closed
their doors.

There will soon be precious little of Melbourne’s
Albert Park left for the people who own it. The Speed-
way, where the well-to-do man exercises his trotter, took
a good slice. Next, Bent proposes to sell another strip
for building allotments ; and now the Middle Park Bowling
Club has annexed a two-acre block. It is a nice green—
the largest in Australia, being 165 ft. by 156 ft., and can be
played on either way, which is an advantage possessed by
few others. Last Saturday, various flabelliform persons,
who stooped with difficulty, said it was a very fine piece
of sward, and would certainly be the green for inter-State
contests.

The late Joseph Bennett held the championship
at British billiards on two occasions, once by the defeat
of Cook, and again by the defeat of John Roberts. He
was never such a brilliant and daring executant as the
latter, and he never had the former’s accuracy with
the spot stroke —barred now. Bennett wrote a book on
billiards, edited by Cavendish—probably the best on the
game ever published.

What a degraded animal the Australian can be
as far as his sports are concerned ! A bush fire destroyed
a coursing ground and a large number of hares at Wagga
(N.S.W.), the other day, and Melbourne Pa oxen was re-
duced to tears by the sad news. The pigeon-mangling
and hare-strangling department held forth thus : “ The
worst loss of all was that of over 60 very fine hares, which
perished in the flames.” No sorrow for the poor roasted
animals. Paunch was simply grieved because the 60 hares
didn’t survive to be chased to death for the edification of
a few bookmakers and other trash.

Champion sculler Towns had a stroke of bad
luck t’other day—a bottle bursting and cutting his hand
severely. Towns has delayed his preparation for the
championship struggle against Stanbury, believing that a
few months’ work will put on enough muscle to defeat the

back greatly. Still, reckoning on recent form. Towns
should be safe.

“Ponte”: The number of two-up schools is
steadily increasing and any obliging ’tec can pass you

places, they didn’t try and put them down, and was told—
“ If we were to sell any of these fellows a pup we’d never
catch a man. They know we play square and we can
always find out where any man we want to locate may be

George Farley, the Australian sprint cyclist,
was born at South Melbourne, December 19th, 1879.
Standing 6ft. l£in. in his socks, red-haired and freckled
faced, he looks the picture of sinuous strength. He came
to the front with a rush in Melbourne at the opening of
this season, and crowned all other exploits by winning the
sprinting championship of the continent from Don
Walker. Farley is a non-smoker and a total abstainer.
• • * *
Geo. Farley writes : In reference to the remarks
made in last week’s issue “ that cyclist Geo. Farley was as
bad as a sportsman as he was great as a rider,” I would
ask for a correction. I consider I was cut down by Elle-
gaard (which I do not think was intentional), and I merely
drew the officials’ attention by putting up my hand, and
did not protest, as was published in some of the papers.

A Yankee automobilist visited Italy lately, and
otle day found himself on what remains of the Appian
Way. Shifting his cigar round to the other side of his
face, the ’Murkan remarked with a nasal twang, “ Gosh !
hiotorihg in the days When this yer road was furst laid
down must have been real slick.” Till a vast improve-
ment takes place in the making of roads generally, the
automobile will progress but little further towards higher
speed. It can now travel much faster than is safe on
any road in the world.

Australia prides itself on the fact that it gives
the world’s biggest first prize for a cycle race, and
reckons that it thereby encourages the pedaller con-
siderably. Very doubtful if it wouldn’t pay the Aus-
tralian professional cyclists better to have more races
with smaller prizes. The £750 first money in the Sydney
Thousand would certainly do the professional riders
more good if it were split up into 15 prizes of £5O each.
A race meeting with a few very big prizes means that, in
order to pay their way and have a shilling or two over,
riders have to resort to teaming, purse-cutting and other
underhand and demoralising practices. The big prize, if
it is numerous enough, is all right, but when it isn’t, is a
direct incentive to villainy.

The heavy pacing-motors and the big wind-
shields will shortly disappear from the cycling tracks of
Paris, owing to the recent slaughter among the world’s
crack pace-followers. The trembling cyclist used to be
Whirled round in a wild suction effort to fall into the
fleeting vacuum at anything under 50 miles an hour, and
a frantic multitude yelled bravos. But it all ended the
same way. A motor tyre would burst, or a speck of grit
would fly across the track, and the centre of gravity
Would change suddenly ; then a cyclist would splash all
over the people in the front seats, and a time-keeper
would announce, in a voice trembling with emotion, that,
had the deceased kept going another lOsec., he would have
chipped 3-sths of a second off the other fellow’s record.
Finally, the audience would file out to the strains of
Beethoven’s Funeral March, and attendants in blouses
would come round with large magnifying-glasses to gather
up the spots, fragments and particles of “ the deceased.”
When it became recognised that the path of the record-
breaker behind pace led to the grave, the supply of pace-
followers began to dwindle. Paris W'ill have to find
another sort of sensation.

Now that Ellegaard has recovered his form, it is
easy to understand why the man was three times cham-
pion of the world. He rides as steadily as though he and
the machine were one creature. The powerful-looking
arms seem to lift the handles up,-the body never moves,
only the white, muscular legs whirl with a piston-like
downward stoke. In the run-off with Farley, on Wednes-
day night, last week, Ellegaard was seen at his best. And
though he was beaten, George Farley rode the race of his
life. The deciding event was a half-mile contest, and the
pacer dropped out half a lap to go. As he drew off
Farley shot away. He seemed to spring forward.
Crouched like a panther, Ellegaard g-lided after him. Again
the Australian shot forward ; but the crouched figure
behind glided up alongside, and together they reeled
through" the greenish light, and again, just opposite the
members’ stand, Farley shot away. The Dane with a
smile on his face swooped up on the outside, and for a
moment he seemed to hang beside the Australian, who
again fairly lifted his machine off the ground. Down
went the great white, piston-like leg. All in a moment the
Dane seemed to double his speed, and shot away from the
struggling Australian, and finished two lengths ahead.
• * * *
The last three nights of the January Cycling
Carnival saw some splendid racing. The savage tussle
between Ellegaard and Ivor Dawson, for the final of the
Summer Wheel Race, ended in a win for the world’s
champion by a few inches. But Saturday night saw
Ellegaard turn the tables very decisively in the final of
the Rutt Half-mile. Lawson, Farley and Rutt managed
to force Ellegaard on to the pacer’s wheel, but at the
scoring board, half a lap from home, Ellegaard went off,
and, increasing the speed, paced the others right round.
At the members’ stand, Rutt shot past Lawson and
secured the Dane’s wheel, leaving Lawson with a clear
opening on the inside for a dart to the line. All three
seemed to leap simultaneously ; in a flash Lawson was
level, with Rutt behind, and before one had time to wink
Ellegaard had glided away and led home by inches.
Farley was out of it, last.
* * * *
The great international match between Ellegaard
and Lawson on Monday night was a disappointing show.
The Dane never gave the slightest evidence of the form
he displayed on the evening of the previous Saturday,
and in the first heat never seemed to jump at all. In the
second heat he actually passed Lawson, but the American
seemed to overtake him without any undue exertion, and
swinging right past him, won by half-a-length.
* * * *
A most exciting cycle race was the Five Mile
Scratch on Saturday night. Since Andersen, the Dane,
made two successful breaks on the field, the Five Milers
have been intensely interesting. It soon became evident
on Saturday night that there was a whole crowd of the
team of 18 who were going to try and do a breakaway,
and some desperate struggles ensued which made the
pace very fast from the jump. Bunch after bunch went
to the front, and rushed frantically off, only to be
caught in a round or so bj r a fresh combination. Then the
field split into two bodies, with Andersen, the Dane, Lar-
combe, Houston, Farley, and Walker in the front, and the
big guns in the back. Then Andersen, Houston, and
Larcombe rushed away from the front bunch, and set up a
little one of their own. So fast they fled that at two to
go Andersen and Larcombe, who had left the second
bunch fully 50 yards behind, seemed to have a certainty.
But Larcombe was rocking, and through the glass Ander-
sen’s dark countenance looked drawn and pinched. Rutt
flashed out from the back bunch and drew them up to the
second, hung" with them a moment, and then dashed on.
Ellegaard whirled up on the outside, slackened suddenly,
and fell back—his tyre had punctured. Already they
were shouting that Farley had won, and others, watching
Ratt’s splendid rush, were shouting the German cham-
pion’s name, when, like a rocket, a pale-blue jersey
streaked in among them, past Ellegaard, past Rutt, past
Walker and Farley, and swept over the line inches to the
good. It was Ivor Lawson, champion of the world, and
that mighty sprint was worthy of j;he title.
MacFarland has been having a joyous time
amongst the Westralian cycling meetings, and evidently
prefers racing in W.A. to meeting Ellegaard, Lawson,
Rutt and Farley, and other good riders in Sydney. Said,
that MacFarland, since the removal of his disqualification
is a marvel of circumspection. The promoters of the
Perth meeting gave MacFarland, M’Donald, Pye and
Morgan 25 per cent, of the gate takings to compete, and,
as the meeting was a success, the riders scored well.
* * * *
Interviewed the other day on his return from
Yankeeland, cyclist Palmer stated “ that there is likely
to be a great influx of cyclists to Australia next season.”
There are yarns of fabulous sums earned by cyclists in
Australia during recent years flying about America,
presumably spread by Australian cycle promoters.
There is just now a mild discussion as to whether
the motor-cycle is likely to generally replace the ordinary
bike. The great safeguard of the bike is the tremendous
disparity in the prices. But, on the other hand, the price
Of the motor-bicycle is falling rapidly. A Market-street,
Sydney, cycle agency is now showing a motor engine
which can be fitted to the ordinary cycle, and which
makes the total cost of machine and engine only £45.
Hitherto the motor cycle has been a heavy machine, cap-
able of enormous speed, and also liable to break down on
a country road and leave its rider with a 20 mile tramp,
wheeling his motor in front of him. The newest develop-
ment has the great advantage that the engine can be
separated from the bike, and left at a wayside station,
and the bicycle is available to ride home on. It gives the
extra advantage of being both a bicycle and a motor-cycle,
and available in either form as required. The engine
is not built for big speeds—about 20 miles per hour will
be its maximum—and that is quite as fast as it is safe to
drive on ordinary roads. In the very worst case a man
can always rely upon his pedals, as the total weight will
never exceed 561 b., and a good roadster, with a hamper
attached, used to weigh that a few years back. One of the
results of the more extensive use of the motor-bike has
been the revival of the pneumatic Saddle. Between five
and six years ago the last pneumatic saddle was discarded.
They were found to be very hot and to roll in a way that
made it almost impossible to work the pedals. With the
motor-driven machine something of the sort is absolutely
essential to minimise the vibration, and the latest luxury
is a pneumatic cover, which can be fastened to any saddle,
and Won’t roll.

With 15 men (including manager Laver) avail-
able for play, the next Australian Eleven will have to
break down in not less than four places at once before it
can claim special allowance for bad luck. As for the
preliminary suggestion that Noble and Howell are likely
to go amiss, it will nullify the excuses should they be
offered during the tour. If two or three members of a
visiting English team were brought out under suspicion
of unsoundness, their breakdown would not be considered
a satisfactory apology for the team’s defeat. Eisky men
are chosen with all risks included.
* * * *
“B.”: Joe Darling was pitchforked into the
Australian XI. mainly because of his long-head as a
captain. It is believed that he will have the position of
captain of the team. M. A. Noble is the only other
candidate for the position.
* * • *
The attendance at junior matches seems to show
that the inauguration of electorate or district cricket
would give the game i-n Victoria a needed impetus. For
four Saturdays thousands stood in the sun at Prince’s
Park, Carlton (umbrellas were taboo and the ground
boasts but few seats) to watch two very junior teams—
Northern District and Fitzroy La Mascotte—play their
first game. Play wasn’t up to interstate or even
Association form, but five times as many spectators
watched the finish as troubled to attend the Carlton v.
East match on the comfortable E. Melb. ground, and same
afternoon nearly as many sat on the Albert Park grass
while Northcote beat South Melb. Footballers’ C.C. But
all these teams are locally recruited, and their records
become the personal property of those suburbs—hence the
attendance. The trouble in club cricket is, of course, the
M.C.C. Nobody wants it dropped out, but if all its
players had to qualify by residence it simply wouldn’t
exist as a team.
* » * «
Another Victorian cricketing grievance comes
from Ellis, of Fitzroy, who refused to take his place in the
Vic. team against Tas., on the ground that he should have
been chosen against N.S.W. and S.A. Ellis makes a
sporting offer to pick a team himself and back it against
the official Vic. team for £lOO, provided the election com-
mittee puts up a similar amount.

“ Ponte ” : Forsyth, a man with only one hand,
playing for Petersham (N.S.W.) Veterans against the
Teachers, knocked up 103 last week. Admitting that the
bowling was tripe and the fielding black pudding—which
is several degrees worse than tripe—the performance is a
remarkable one. The score included two s’s. Is there
any record of a five having been hit before with only one
hand?
* * * *
dandow’s oldtime records as a wrestler are a
sufficient answer to the nonsense fat Carkeek talked con- <
cerning the comparatively slim-waisted exponents of *
physical culture in competition with men who devote
their bulk to ground tumbling under Graeco-Roman rules.
A little Melb. paper, the Australian Cyclist, revives
some forgotten stories of Sandow as a wrestler. In Italy
he was challenged by Bartoletti, who wagered 5000 francs
on the result. The Italian expert was reckoned to have a
soft thing on, but Sandow beat him easily—twice. Then
he tackled Sali, the champion weight-lifter who visited
Australia years ago. Sali made a long struggle of it,
but Sandow outstayed him. Three other Italians
were thrown by the mighty German, then in his prime,
and subsequently he had his awful go with Muller.
Mueller, finding he couldn’t win by fair means, tried to
break Sandow’s right forearm at the wrist, and did
actually force two of his fingers into his flesh, crushing
the veins until they burst. Sandow by this time was the
maddest Hercules. He jerked back his left arm, got hold
of Muller, gradually drew the man towards him, and then
squeezed him until four of his ribs cracked. Muller was
carried off the stage, crushed out. The injuries that
Sandow had suffered in the meantime kept him out of
business for four months, and sickened him of profes-
sional wrestling.
* * • •
Clarence Weber, the good-looking strong boy
(he’s 22), who got so brutally fingered by one of the
Hindus at Wirth’s Circus, seems to be coming along
steadily as a wrestler. A few months ago, when Carkeek
was teaching the young idea how to talk at Melbourne
Opera House, his brawny colleague, Gus Rennert, made
no trouble about throwing Weber, the youngster being
the merest novice. One night last week the men were
matched again, and neither man could throw the other
in 10 minutes, catch-as-catch-can style. Weber had pre-
viously scored a fall off Gunner Moir, a mighty strong
armful for a young fellow to tackle. Given Rennert’s
knowledge of the tricky game, it would even now be odds
on Weber against the more mature giant.
.** * *
When Jack Carkeek, the Cornish-American
wrestler, arrived at ’Frisco things began to happen in that
city. A stocky Frenchman, who called himself Batta,
appeared with a huge black wrestler, whom he said was
Buzayell, the great Algerian exponent of the Grseco-
Roman style. Nobody had ever heard of Buzayell, but
he was a picturesque heap of color, and went round
’Frisco’s streets in blue and gold baggy pants, silk socks,
laced jackets of crimson silk and many variations of the
fez. YVhen asked if he and his nigger were identical with
Sabas and Merzouk, who had played vain tricks in Aus-
tralia, Batta was righteously indignant, and denied ever
having been on the Loan continent, but said he and
Buzayell intended visiting: this country when 'Murka was
worked out. Like Merzouk, Buzayell could not speak Eng-
lish. A match was suggested between Buzayell and Jen-
kins, the U.S.A. champion. Jenkins was catch-as-catch-
can, and Buzayell was Graeco-Roman (so was Merzouk), but
after much negotiation the American agreed to meet the
greasy stranger. The tussle was sensational. When
Jenkins unintentionally relapsed into catch-as-catch-can
style, Buzayell suddenly acquired a knowledge of English
and appealed to the referee in that language. Later on
he told the crowd to shut up. When his nose got
squashed flat in some sort of hold the black broke loose
and butted the white in the face with his head. The
white swung a heavy right on the black jaw, and then the
peace-makers intervened and the match resumed. After
two hours’ wallowing in a lake of perspiration the white
secured a hammerloek, and they both rolled off the plat-
form. When they were fished out it was found that
Buzayell had inflicted a terrific bite on the white man’s
stomach—and for biting an American citizen a black man
is liable to 14 years’ imprisonment. Jenkins went to hos-
pital ; Buzayell to gaol. But he was liberated, and is said
to have immediately left for Australia.

schmidt talks of getting into shape to fight world’s cham-
pion pug Jeffries. The mission is, for him, a hopeless one.
He is too tied up with muscle, too short in stature and
limb, and comes of a race that never in the history of thu
game produced a pug of even mediocre ability. Sandow
talked similarly in America years ago, and threatened to
completely annihilate half-a-dozen in one ring;. An
astonishing number, including then world’s champion Jim
Corbett, presented themselves to be dealt with, but San-
dow backed down.

Judging by the delay in arranging a wrestling
match between Russian Hackenschmidt and the Hindus
Buttan Singh and Gunga Brahm, our colored fellow
subjects from the coral strand are not over anxious to
meet the Russian. Generally understood that they are
hedging themselves round with conditions and special
arrangements to such an extent that, should they win, it
will be a victory of Oriental finesse and not of skill.
Hackenschmidt talks in a reckless fashion of wrestling
both the heathens, one after the other, in the same ring
the same evening. It would not be a fair match, for both
the Hindus, or Afghans, or whatever they are, are power-
ful fellows, and, judging by Clarence Weber’s experience,
not too particular as to how
The Tweedie-Casey scrap at Sydney National
Sporting Club, last week, was a veritable smiling match.
Did Tweedie make Casey’s teeth rattle, Casey smiled
widely while he jerked his head back into position, and
when Casey knocked Tweedie’s mouth round under his
left ear, immediately it returned to its natural position,
or as near it as it could, Tweedie would grin with ghastly
artificial mirth. The grinning boxer is a horror 1 Tweedie
showed much more command over his hands, and had a
knack of getting home long-range blows which were
rather pretty to see. One long upper-cut took the tip of
Casey’s chin, and stretched him out, but he was on his
feet and bounding round again in double quick time. The
last part of the scrap was far from exciting, and neither
party suffered niuch after the 11th round. At the con-
clusion the referee decided that Tweedie had won on points.

The fifth battle between B. Turner and E.
Jessop, at Sydney Gaiety on Saturday night, like its four
predecessors, ended in a draw. Both bruisers have a
wholesome regard for one another, and each fights a
cautious battle in which he gives no chances, and the
result is a draw every time. If the pair Were matched to
fight an unlimited number of rounds till one was knocked
out, they would show a very different sort of fight, and
one or the other would win in about ten rounds.

Although Cecil Healy overtook, bumped into,
and eventually finished before Alick Wickham in the 9th
heat of the inter-club handicap at Bondi baths (Sydney),
Saturday, he failed to break the Island boy’s record for
the distance, which is the world's best. On Saturday
Healy did the distance in 26 4-ssec., which was not only
outside Wickham’s world record, but also 1 3-ssec. outside
his own time for the same distance, put up in Rushcutters
Bay bath, February 20th, last year. On March 26th, 1904,
in the same bath, Wickham beat his own world record of
25sec. by reducing it to 24 3-ssec. So that Healy’s time
was actually 2 l-ssec. outside Wickham’s last record, and
not 1 4-ssec. as erroneously stated in several Sydney
papers, and was not a particularly startling performance
in any way. In the 100yds. Healy did infinitely better.
Although the conditions were not the most favorable in
the world, owing to a strong N.E. wind and other things,
he managed to streak through the distance in 58sec.
exactly, and thereby placed himself alongside Dick
Oavill as part proprietor in the world’s best—originally
made by Dick in the Rushcutters Bay baths, January
16th, last year.

Sydney Flying Squadron had one of the wildest
races in its history, on Saturday afternoon, when a black
nor’-easter swept over Sydney Harbor. The Westralian
crew were accommodated on board six of the boats, and
two of them were treated to capsizes. They took them
out to show them over the harbor, and pitched them into
it. Eleven started, and soon split into divisions which
met at Taylor Bay. When the spinnakers were set, the
boats got on a great speed and plunged thrillingly through
the choppy water. But there was too much canvas, and
Arawa and Arline both capsized in almost exactly the
some spot. Arline has capsized two Saturdays run-
ning now. Jibing round Shark Island there was
more trouble, and one of the boats crashed into the
club steamer and carried away her shrouds. So far,
Myee, the limit boat, had led all the way, and in the
desperate resolve to win or drown ballooners were hoisted
for the second lead. At the second jibe at Shark Island
the Myee was still leading when oyer she went, splash.
A few moments afterwards-Desdemona also capsized, and
Australian hung undecided whether to right herself or go
clean over, and finally came up rocking. This left
Donnelly in front, with Qui Vive next and Keriki coming
with a great rush. That rush, like many others made
lately by the same boat, started too late, and they finished
in the order named. It was the wettest race held cn
Sydney Harbor for a long while.
- * * * *
N.S.W. Rowing Association’s definition of an
amateur, part of which reads “one who has not been
employed in or about boats for wages,” is being discussed
just now because it shuts out one or two water policemen
who wish to join clubs and whose duties occasionally
necessitate their being employed in boats.

GEORGE J. COHEN, Chairman.

A. J. SOUTAR, Accountant.
... . , , . .. Sydney, 10th January, 1905.
_ '’ re .r? certify. that we have examined the bills, compared the balances and counted the coin in the Head
Olhce of the Commercial Banking’ Company of Sydney, Limited, and have compared the returns of the Branches, and
have found the same as specified in the foregoing Balance Sheet.
The following resolutions were carried unanimously
E. S. CAPE,
A. H. K. MAXWELL
Auditors.
“ That the Report and Statements of Account be received and adopted, and ordered to be circulated amon°* the
Proprietors. ” a
‘ That the thanks of the Shareholders be presented to the Directors, General Manager, and Officers of the Bank
for their very satisfactory management of the affairs of the institution.”
T. A. DIBBS, General Manager.
The Chairman, Mr. G. J. Cohen, in moving the adoption of the Report, said : “ The Directors are again pleased to
present to the Shareholders a satisfactory report and a strong balance-sheet. The holding of gold coin and liquid
assets equals 9s. in the £, ag'ainst deposits, bills in circulation, and notes, which comprise all the liabilities to the
public. Comparing the balance-sheet now submitted with that of this period last year, I find the note circulation has
decreased £21,000, and the bills in circulation £236,000. This is what might be expected from the shrinkage in trade
and diminished expenditure for wages, also to the fact that gold coin is gradually displacing notes in all the States of
the Commonwealth. The deposits in the 12 months have increased £603,000. On the credit side the coin is £2,719 000,
being an increase of £505,000. The coin and liquid securities amount to £5,629,000, an increase of £723,000, while the
lendings have decreased £346,000. This is partly due to the early arrival of wool and wheat, the realisation of which
has naturally reduced our advances. We are paying the usual dividend of 10 per cent, per annum, and again place
£15,000 to the reserve fund, making it £1,070,000, or £70,000 in excess of the paid-up capital of the bank. I congratu-
late the proprietors on this highly satisfactory termination of the half-year, and have now the pleasure to move that
the report and statements of account be received and adopted, and ordered to be circulated among the proprietors.”

Dear Bulletin. —Sharks may be staunch
White Australians and severely draw the color-
line, but the huge North Queensland rock cod cer-
tainly loves the colored gen’man no less than the
Q. Kanaka press. Blackfellows on the Far North
and Gulf Coast have told me that they were not
afraid of sharks or alligators, but professed pro-
found fear of the rock cod, and couldn’t be induced
to enter water where that finny cannibal resides.
These cods, by the way, reach enormous sizes,
and, like the Murray-cod, are all mouth. Saw
one caught at Port Douglas some years ago. It
weighed fully 3cwt., while a horse and dray could
have driven comfortably into its huge mouth—if
they had been a bit smaller. —R. R. Hill.
There is a certain indefinable quaintness
about the goanna. When chased from the fowl-
house by the farmer, his seven children, and the
dog, he never loses his innate calm. He even
watches the cocky sympathetically from the top
of his tree as that embittered agriculturist tries to
shoot him with a gun that won’t go off. Waking
from a siesta in the bush, you often see him
smiling cynically at you from the tree overhead.
His brother-ghoul, the crow, who sings dirges all
day, is detested in the bush, whilst the goanna,
because he chews his decayed bullock with a
comical glint in his eye, is befriended. The saving
grace of humor !
“ K.K.” : Was putting up for the night at
a N.S.W. country hotel, and shared a room with
a stranger. About two in the morning I wanted
a smoke, and quietly lit up. I was just settling
back contentedly when the man in the bed
opened his eyes, gave one blood-curdling yell,
sprang out of bed, and smashed the window.
Having done that most thoroughly, he climbed
through on to the balcony, and slid down a veran-
dah post to the ground. He explained (in his
shirt, -to an admiring crowd) that he had once
narrowly escaped death by fire in a hotel, and
now took no chances.
John Cameron, M.L.A., greatly enter-
tained the Royal Society of Brisbane once by
telling how, in the early days of the Barcoo, a
number of bush roysterers were boozing on bad
rum in a Tambo pub. One of them, feeling ill,
accused the landlord of poisoning him with bad
liquor. Bung was forthwith tried, found guilty,
tied up in a greenhide noose, and hanged over his
own bar. Fortunately the tie beam broke and
Boniface fell, to be taken up, revived by the
repentant Nosey-Bobs, and persuaded to resume
beer-pulling.
“ Bushman” : Ever been real hungry ? I
have. Six days and nights, out at Middlesex. I
had cut across by “ Strong’s rush ” from Zeehan.
No compass ; heavy drizzling rain. Couldn’t see
the mountains. Didn’t shake me up much. Stuck
to my swag. Terribly weak, though. Twenty
yards and a spell. Like a man in a trance ; sort
of half-dreaming. Reckon I’d have soon gone
mad. Struck a camp. “Now for a feed.”
Couldn’t face it. It choked me. How I could eat
next day, though ! Another time hungry, through
the Linda. Cut across from Queenstown to Mt.
Reid, by Tyndall. She’s a nice track. There it
“ gripped ” me, going up the White Spur. Hadn’t
had a square feed for weeks ; then nothing at all
for ’bout two days topped it up. Pain. Every
nerve and fibre singing out for food. Must have
it, or —under. Well, I pulled-out—somehow.
Made me think a bit. If some of those sleek,
bell-toppered Justices had felt, just once in their
lives, same as I did, coming up that White Spur
—well, they’d have had a bit of “guts” for the
poor devil hauled-up before them for taking a loaf
of bread.
“ Hufiin-Guffin ” : Have any Bulletin
readers noted the whistles of different engine-
drivers ? The whistle largely indicates the
character of the man who uses it. A horrible
shrill shriek will tell you at once that the driver
is a vigorous man. If it starts on a low key and
ends on the same he is probably lazy and lacks
energy. In indicating to the signalman the
various roads and signals required, several “long ”
and “short” whistles are often needed. Some
drivers give the “ long ” and “ short ” sounds clear
and distinct. Others jumble them all up together.
The first driver is clear and concise in his reason-
ings, however humble they may be. The second
is ignorant, indifferent, lazy. Others give long,
loud whistles always, whether necessary or not.
That is generally an indication of self-esteem—
“ showing off ”as the children say. A short, faint
pop of the whistle is almost certain to show a mind
that is occupied on other matters guiding the hand
that moves the whistle valve. Low-toned whistling
betokens a modest driver. Variety of tone, with
curious changes of volume, may indicate a
humorous character. Long, low notes, mixed up
with short, high ones and vice versa, probably tell
of a musical mind behind the hand.
“ Ed.” : Saw an old fellow in Melbourne
with a basket and a sign, “ Support an old
naturalist.” His wares were a number of dead
specimens of the great green cicada—although he
called them Cyclochila Australasiae to prove his
bona Jides. As a business man he misses the ’bus.
In Naples they sell them as “songsters,” in small
cages. This cicada, or tree locust, is a curious
musical instrument. Under his wings is a sound-
box, almost |in. each way, and into this he directs
a current of air, which sets a thin ribbon of mem-
brane, stretched across the opening, vibrating.
The sound-box has stiff, splendidly-resonating
sides. Can quite understand his far-reaching
musical powers after a look at the build of it.
This cicada is the perfect insect; as a grub it lives
for a long term underground. It crawls up
trees here, white gums, for preference, punctures
the bark with its “ beak,” and sucks the juices of
the tree. After that the tree bleeds, and the sap
desiccating forms the “manna” of bush young-
sters.

IT IS FREE FROM TECHNICAL TERMS, and-shows up Human
Nature as it exists. Here are answered, in plain language, a thou-
sand questions that occur to the minds of young and old, but about
which they feel a delicacy in consulting their physician. Chapters
are devoted to innumerable interesting subjects concerning mar-
riage, which makes it a superior guide to the action of men and
women both, in and out of marriage. No man or woman who
anticipates a bright future, and wishes to enjoy married life in its
fullest sense, can afford to dispense with the information embraced
in its covers. The new 20th Century edition just arrived.

The Inky Way.
Away in the fifties one of Brisbane’s most active press-
men was Wilks, of the Courier, who in old age came to
Svdney to edit Sam Bennett’s Town and Country Journal.
Wilks was a hard customer. A deputation of Brisbane
men waited upon him with a complaint that the Courier
did not correctly give the times of high and low water.
These business men were shut up with something like
this. “ Look here !if the tides don’t know the proper
time to come up, it’s their look out, not mine. All I
know is that the correct hour is always printed in the
Courier, and if the tides can’t manage to arrive then, so
much the worse for the tides, that’s all.” In the Town and
Country Wilks wrote under the pen-name “The Fla-
neur.” Those who remember the tattered class of press-
men employed on the Evening News and T. and 0. Jour-
nal in and about 1871 will understand the following :
#-* * »
When Sam Bennett was building the then great offices
in Pitt-street, a couple of doors from King-street, he was
once standing at Bill Moffatt’s bookshop, opposite, admir-
ing'the rising structure. Wilks happened to pass by ;he
had, in fact, just emerged from the old Liverpool Arms,
at the corner. Sam Bennett, in an unusually cordial
mood, bade him “ Good day,” and’ invited his opinion as
to some design for the top of the building (Caxton and
his printing press, in stone, ultimately adorned the
coping). Mr. Wilks suggested the arms of the Karl of
Warwick, and Sam the Surly asked what on earth they
were. Then the old man, bringing up all his venom, re-
plied “ The Bear and the Ragged Staff.”
H. J. Peat, now dead, joined the Town and Country
Journal as cashier in 1870. To him came, one
morning, Mr. Wilks with a bland request for ss.
till pay-day. Of course, Mr. Peat considered that
the editor was good enough for an advance of
55., and without demur handed over the coin.
A couple of hours afterwards Mr. Bennett was heard
inquiring all over the office for Mr. Wilks, who could not
be found. At length Surly Sam bethought him of the
new cashier. Yes, Mr. Peat had seen Mr. Wilks that
morning and had advanced him ss. “ Hum, ha ! ” quoth
Samuel Bennett, “ I will have to bring out the paper this
week myself,” and, with a solemn injunction to Peat
never ag'ain to make an advance to Wilks until the paper
had gone to press, “ Old Sam ” took off his coat and got
to work like a Trojan made of lead.

“ liaira ” : Sunday morning is a big time at Koru. We
haven’t a local rag, but any item of absorbing interest is
posted opposite the pub—it was Bung’s idea, of course.
There is a green near, and we can settle there with fisti-
cuffs whose opinions are the right ones. During the
early stages of the Bear-Monkey slaughter we had a daily
issue ; then the board (it’s really a big telegraph post)
remained a blank till Murphy accused Hoolahan of steal-
ing one of his pigs. The beak dismissed the case with
sundry remarks about the brotherhood of man, and now
they are fighting their case on the board. They post their
budget alternate Saturday nights ; and Sunday morning
sees the populace assembled to discuss the merits of the
case, and, now and again, the local spud disease. The
disputants have forgotten the subject of the controversy,
and now indulge in personal abuse. Murphy has acquired
the nickname of Paddy, which Hoolahan alleged in last
budget was given him owing to his resemblance to Hogan’s
pig of the same name. Murphy retorted last week ; and
this week we are looking for something that ought to end
in a fight. Anyway, Bung is hoping for the worst, and is
clearing the battlefield of dead marines, and getting in an
extra supply of drink.

The Bulletin recently received this (apparently from
an emissary of the Pastoralists’ Union) enclosing' a fear-
some set of verses called the “ Gold Digger: ”
“ To the Manager of the Bulleteen
“Dear Sir, —Has I do writings of veres of Pomes and
parrs for different papers I thought I would send you the
gold digger you can pay me what you think it is worth I
can send you some very good parrs against the Shearers
Union wich are real facts you can let me know if you are
prepared to pay me for parrs and poetery if you pay me
for the lines of poetery of the gold digger send the money
to Hamelton South Australia

At Riddell’s Creek a Vic. farmer has a novel way of
getting his Melbourne daily paper in good time of a morn-
ing. It comes from Melbourne by Syme’s express, and is
addressed “ Mr. Hayseed, Riddell’s Creek. Please throw
off at stick.” The stick is a bit of sapling with paper tied
around it, inside the railway fence. The guard, in pass-
ing', throws the paper off at the stick. When the train
has passed, the farmer, who lives about a mile off the line,
sets loose a trained collie dog, which goes to the railway
line and brings the paper home. The farmer thus enjoys
the latest gore news with his bacon and eggs.
A PRAYER.
[FOR THE BULLEIN.]
Oh Lord, I send up a daily prayer,
Not asking for wealth and riches rare,
Or a rude request that a God might flout,
But a favor small from Thee I pray,
And my humble prayer goes up each day
“ Lord, give me something to write about.’
To me’send.paragraphs short and bright,
That will fill the Editor with delight,
And add some joy to his weary task—
Plots for yarns that are strong and new,
Good verse ideas, send me a few—
Oh Lord, ’tis a favor small I ask.
You know the heart of the cold, cold Ed.,
’Tis hard as flint, and at times 1 dread
The day that my stock will peter out;
So turn to my prayer a willing ear
And send me daily a bright thought here—
A brand-new thought I can write abo it.

Away up in the Air.
In America they have for a dozen years past
been erecting business buildings from fifteen to
thirty.stories high ; and the upper floors rent for
almost or quite as much as the lower ones.
The possibility of this is, of course, due to the
development of the lift, or “elevator,” as our
cousins over there name it. Any arrangement
that takes us off the earth, without trouble and
exertion to us, opens a new area of existence. Of
all the various ways of making a man’s legs ache,
taking the breath out of him, climbing stairs beats
the band. And this brings me round to the spot
I ought perhaps to have started from —Mr.
McDonald and his troubles. But, let him tell his
own story.
Mr. John McDonald is a stalwart young black-
smith and farrier, and is known as one of the
strongest men in Adelaide. On February 17th,
1904, he was living at No. 10, Corryton-street,
Adelaide, and wrote to the proprietors of Mother
Seigel’s remedies, saying :
“ About a year and nine months back my health
began to fail. I could not eat, and suffered much
from indigestion. My stomach was frequently
distended with wind, I had acute pains in the
back and chest and severe heart palpitations, so
that I began to fear I had heart disease. This
alarmed me. My doctor declared that my heart
was sound; but he added that my system was
thoroughly run down, and that I was suffering
from dyspepsia, sluggish liver, and general con-
gestion. He treated me for some time, but I got
worse instead of better. I could not sleep and fell
off in weight from eleven stone to nine stone odd.
“The most trifling task became burdensome
and I felt very dejected and miserable. While
in this state, twelve months back, a friend pre-
vailed on me to try a bottle of Mother Seigel's
Syrup. It benefited me at once, and when I had
taken in all about eight bottles I was entirely free
from all signs of disease. I now weigh eleven stone
three, can eat and sleep well, am as strong as ever
I was in my life, and can do any amount of hard
work, and this improvement is due entirely to
Mother Seigel’s Syrup.”
It is all of a piece. Whether we want to work
at this, that, or the other ; to forge iron or climb
stairs, we must get the digestion right; and that
is where Mother Seigel’s Syrup has a place pretty
much to itself.*
A London barrister lately instanced a
, , , , . .
humorous case of a policeman drawing a false in-
ference of self-confessed guilt from an innocent
remark made by the prisoner. The constable de-
posed—“ I took the prisoner to the police station.
On his way he admitted the theft.” “ Give me his
exact words,” said counsel for the prosecution.
The precious myrmidon of the law, with all the
air of an unanswerable witness, replied “ Hisexact
words were ‘ Tins will kill my poor mother.' ” A
more palpably dishonest instance of police misrep-
resentation was published in The Bulletin years
ago. George Upward, the graceful and ornamental
member of the Commonwealth Parliament staff,
tells this story, dating back to the time when he
was a Judge’s associate. The prisoner, a girl of
improper character, stood charged with stealing a
scarf pin from a man in Swanston-street, Mel-
bourne. Prosecutor, more or less unsober, had got
a crowd round him when he missed the pin from
his scarf. A policeman came along, and the un-
sober one hastily picked out the girl as the person
who had robbed him—presuming that he was
robbed. “I took her into custody, and
she said ‘ I stole the man’s scarf pin,”
swore the constable. There was no sort of
corroborative evidence, nor any defence. Prisoner
could say nothing for herself, nevertheless the
Judge was not convinced. Her appearance and
manner in the dock didn’t support the constable’s
plain, straightforward statement of her having
owned up to the robbery. But, after fishing for
further information and failing to catch any,
his Honor was about to let the jury do their
inevitable worst when a diffident old fellow
came from the back of the court and asked
to be allowed to give evidence as follows,
witnesged f he trouble in Swanston-
street He saw the girl taken into custody
and } ie heard her speak the words sworn to by the
p () ji ce man But her intonation gave the words a
leaning which the policeman had distorted. She
said w^th indignant emphasis on the pronoun,
“/stole the man’s scarf-pin ! ” His Honor directed
the j ury to return a verdict of “ Not Guilty.”
“Marat : Please let me give one small
snort of dissent. I don’t bustle much to join this
Society for Getting Wild that seems so fashion-
able. The getting wild exhausts an extensive
section of one’s energy, and the small portion of
tangible work executed afterwards doesn’t warrant
the huge preparations. I favor for effective work
the bilious, murky individual who loves wet days
and who is gradually accumulating a store of
spleen that seizes the right moment to make its
presence felt. All great revolutions were pre-
ceded by a “livery,” cloudy-day period, during
which the mind, muscle and spleen of the revolu-
tionists were holding a three-cornered council of
war. The dashed wild uprisings mixed up with
streams of skite, picturesque posing and flash tom-
foolery, generally end in the leaders being hauled
from underneath scrub or dead vegetable matter,
while the privates are sueing for peace on any
terms. The stolid, bilious person who never gets
wild has been a large snag in the path of the pic-
turesque “get me a sword and I’ll do things”
person. When I uprise I will pick a bilious, un-
emotional leader who has never been known to
speak or write six sentences of oratory.

Fred Thonemann, who specialises in Melbourne
in loan deals, has placed the big- block of Central Plateau,
Ballarat, forfeited shares. Pumps will be set going-, and
another chance will be given to Sebastopol Plateau
mining. If Thonemann had not come to rescue, it would
have been a poor lookout for the Star of the East. Now
it has a chance to test the deep ground at moderate cost.
What it will find is another matter.

Jerusalem, up Smeaton way, isn’t a golden city
to Victorian mining speculators. It is the home of the
Spring Hill Leads, and no one has ever heard any choral
rejoicings over that mine. With an outlay of £153,125,
of which £lOO,OOO has come from calls and £49,010 from
gold, not a cent has been paid in divs. And, despite the
fuss about the tribute from the Berry Extended, time
will be required to drain the block leased from that co.
Directors have a bank overdraft of £2792, and their chance
of getting more isn’t rosy.

There does not look to be the same candor in
the Lord Nelson, St. Arnaud, mine report as there was in
old Zebina Lane’s days. He set out in tabulated form
each half-year the exact quantity of stone in the stopes.
His successor', maybe with the best intentions, has
abandoned the table. Shareholders do not like the
change, and say so. Co. has paid £237,000 in divs., and
yet, when it wanted 10-head of stamps and a bit of other
plant, had barely enough money in reserve to meet the
expenditure. When directors sail so close to the wind,
they deserve a set-back to teach them business methods.
Co. may be put out of danger by payable stone found at
the 750 ft. level, outside the range of the shoot worked
down to 1610 ft. But even that does not justify the
absence of provision for a rainy day.
Victorian State Govt, was asked for £lOO,OOO by
indigent mining ventures chat wanted aid under the
prospecting vote of £20,000. This sum is cut up mostly
among little shows, but £5OOO goes in a lump to a Bull-
owned concern, the Ascot G.M. Co., on the condition that
it puts up £15,000. There was a hint that Bewick,
Moreing and Co. intended to open up the Ascot deep lead.
If they hold adjoining ground, why should the State pay
the piper to help to prove it ? If it does, surely they
ought to help.

The little Union 00. professes to be almost
assured of a decent future for its 12-acres property at
Diamond Creek (Vic.), lately awakened from a long sleep.
Stated that three shoots of payable stone can be worked
from the old main shaft, which is sunk to 500 ft., and will
be unwatered within three months. The Union in the
old days was profitable until the flood came ; only one
shoot had been worked for a yield of £60,000, and the
excuses given for abandoning the property are more satis-
factory to the ear than the average excuse advanced in
hundreds of similar cases. Stock brokers, as a rule, have
no use for Diamond Creek. It is too near Melbourne. It
wants the distance that lends enchantment to a pro-
spectus. Nevertheless the record of the bygone output
is undeniable, and the new co. has already scored a
matter of 4400 z. from about the same number of tons.

First thoughts up-north always seem to fly to
color. Even the remarkably rich surface copper-show,
0.K., has let its carrying contract to Abdul Wade’s
Afghan Camel Carrying 00. Perhaps next week they’ll
tell us that white men can’t drive a bullock.

Tartana (N.Q.) publishes with its annual report
to 31st Dec. Thomas Gibb’s two reports on the show.
First time, in July, Gibb said that the best way to treat
the ore would be by leaching, but acid wasn’t available ;
next time, in December, further prospecting having been
done, pvritic ore was developed sufficiently to provide sul-
phuric acid and justify this process. The bulk of the
Tartana stuff is poor; proposal, therefore, is to heap
aside the poorer parts of it for treatment by cementation.
This is the remarkably cheap system practised largely in
Spain, and introduced to Australia for the treatment of
the Wallaroo and Moonta Co.’s refuse ; it consists merely
of atmospheric oxidation of the’ copper, when the metal
can be washed out, and recovered by precipitation
on iron. Treating 150 tons pyritie 2 per cent,
ore (50 tons for calcining and acid production, and
100 tons for cementation) and 1100 tons oxidised ore,
Thomas Gibb reckons the profit at £2O 18s. 3d. per ton
copper, less cost of carriage and realisation ; and he thinks
to recover 23 tons per week—that is, about I’B4 per cent,
of copper. The metal from cementation isn’t reckoned
in this —it takes some years to get results from that slow
process. So far, however, as prospecting has definitely
shown, there isn’t anything huge in the property ; and
estimates seem to have been based often on very narrow
data. Plant would cost, say, £12,500 ; and the directors
don’t mention where it is to come from. Co. has no funds
whatever, and no assets but the property (even “ plant ”
represents only £l5), but it has sundry debts amounting
to £5083, portion, however, representing.part of purchase
price, payable when directors may decide.
Golden Horseshoe, Kalgoorlie (W.A.), besides
paying £BlO,OOO in divs. during- the past threee years, has
redeemed £50,000 debentures created in June, 1901, to
pay for second 50-head mill, and also £BO,OOO, created in
July, 1902, to pay for third 50-head. This record will take
beating. Co. is now free from debt, fully equipped, and
has the largest ore reserves on the Golden Belt. The
plant and workings are gradually being retrieved from the
mess in which they recently fell, and a long period of
prosperity seems ahead. It is not a mine that lends itself
to cheap working, as 8., M. and Co. found, but, as the
average ore is about 21dwt., it can be worked at a large
profit. Manager Sutherland is in touch with all the
details of underground workings and plant, and runs the
show economically.
Burbank’s Birthday Gift (W.A.) has great
chances, if one is to believe the predictions of its sponsors.
Co. has been reconstructed with an assessment of 4s. per
share, of which Is. 6d. has been called. Chairman had to
admit that fourth and fifth levels were barren ; but, at
800 ft., short chutes of pay ore have been found, though
nothing to justify any hope of divs. However, John Bull
is still sanguine. Chairman told shareholders that new
co. was registered in W.A. (presumably to dodge English
Acts), and that the statutory meeting of co. had been
held there by the seven signatories to the Articles of
Association. The meeting must have been held very
quietly, as no one seems to have heard of it or the seven
signatories alluded to.
Culcairn: Highly speculative; prospects slightly
better lately Kemo : Society is all right, though not
very cheaply-worked, wherefore bonuses are likely to be
small; but it’s a fool of a table to insure under. Pay-
ments into a Savings Bank, would give better return
Askold : Hasn’t a 100 to 1 chance of paying divs.

The pushing-off of blocks that used to be recom-
mended because they were in sight of the B.H. Prop,
smelter-stacks, but have been abandoned for years, isn’t
finished yet. Something in the metallurgical way may
turn up to make these payable ; hut it’s slow waiting, and
the labor conditions are likely to give trouble before much
change happens. At present these claims haven’t a chance
of paying. One is being recommended as being next to a
block held by the B.H. Prop. Just as well to mention
that the B.H. Prop, took it up, not for its ore, but for its
water.

Ballarat branch of the Miners’ Association has
gone to leeward £B5 during the past year. The splendid
purpose of the organisation is shown by the fact that, out
of £517 levied, £284 went to help the families of members
who died during the term. Conference of A.M.A.’s
at Ballarat during next month intends to try to weld the
mine labor ranks, - by proposing affiliation with kindred
organisations in the" other States. That is the way to
secure strength, and be in a position to help the lot of the
white slaves underground.

Australasia ought to be able to produce pretty
fair geologists by this time ; anyway, it can do as good
mining as there is anywhere in the world, and its young
mining engineers are getting better results from its own
mines than the imported men who are working alongside
them. Nevertheless, M.L. has gone to Canada for a
Government Geologist—a young man named Dr. Bell,
whose practical fleldi work seems to have been limited to
three or four years. Still his scientific attainments can’t
be questioned'; for a while past he has been assistant to
the Professor of Geology at Harvard University. Twenty-
one Australians applied for the billet.

“ Barry Lyndon ” : The sketches of mining life
in which a windlass occupies the position of honor, appear-
ing from time to time in Tub Bulletin, lead me to believe
that the creators of said sketches have rather hazy
notions in regard to that important factor in developing
the great natural resources of this country. Have taken
particular notice of drawings from time to time, and find
that the artist usually depicts the rope as winding a way
from the bearded ruffian at the business end of the
machine, and in other instances winding on the opposite
side of the barrel. I have had a little to do with windlasses
in my time, from the humble crooked sapling with a
wooden handle to the finished pine article with trimmings,
and would be eternally obliged if some reliable person
(not a butter agent) will inform me how the man on top
manages to land the bucket. The only feasible explana-
tion I can glean up to the present is that the man below
comes up after each bucket and lands it. I had a capi-
talistic friend with £178,423 to invest in Australia, but he
saw that windlass and refused to have anything to do with
the country till the matter was cleared up.

Resident engineer of British S’African co. bears
out our opinion of the cabled report of “rich alluvial
discoveries ”in Rhodesia. He describes the deposits as
“patchy, and chiefly shed gold,” and believes “the
ancients secured the bulk of the metal.”
* * * *
“M.C.” : B. (12/l/’O5) points out that N.S.W.
mining co.’s find it more profitable to export ore to
Europe than to smelt locally. In 1903 something like
60,000 tons of concentrates were shipped to Antwerp,
Bremen and Hamburg, and, with zinc ore, that quantity
has since been nearly doubled. The benefits the Germans
get out of this trade compensate for the shipping subsidy
they pay. The foreigners not only want the smelting
trade, but also want the control of the metal market.
The Straits Settlements, which produce most of the tin
ore, have had to put up a fight against a particularly
powerful foreign ring. They have cheap labor in the
Straits ; but that did not prevent the export of tin ore
(one of the most easily treated minerals), so the Govern-
ment had to raise the export duty on tin ore to a pro-
hibitive rate. Cheap labor and all the latest economies in
smelting will not enable Australia to get the spelter and
galvanising trade ; nothing but very liberal assistance will
do that. But the fool-Australian who begrudges a little
preference on the carriage of his own galvanised iron over
his own rails is not likely to bo in a violent hurry to assist
anything.
AT POVERTY POINT.
In excuse for the poor character of their wares, Aus-
tralian theatrical managers assert that no good new plays
are to be got. Plays with strong women parts are
especially scarce. When one does see the light, the Aus-
tralian rights are not to be bought. “We might go to
Australia some day ourselves,” say the owners. As a case
in point, take “Du Barry,” which could not be bought
for Nellie Stewart at any price. This would seem to give
the local playwright a chance.
Annette Kellermann has been giving exhibitions at
Broken Hill —swimming exhibitions at Broken Hill in
midsummer ! And Broken Hillites rushed in such quan-
tity to see the shapely dripping vision that they had to
strip off large quantities of the iron roof of the baths to
allow themselves to breathe.
Alfred Dampier, now playing at Adelaide Theatre
Royal, suffered a slight stroke of paralysis through the
intense heat. For some nights, however, he refused to
give in, and report (good old report) says that he was
obliged to wear an electric battery up his sleeve to make
his tongue work. Presumably, he thus galvanised the
audiences to about the usual extent.
The other Saturday night, when Florence Young was
singing her first solo in “Florodora,” at Her Majesty’s
(Melbourne), a midshipman from the front stalls clambered
upon the stage and danced a hornpipe, whilst the silliest
section of the audience applauded the young bounder’s
impudence. The incident “on its own ” was not specially
objectionable. The young fellow—still in his teens—could
dance a hornpipe well enough, and after he had done it he
returned rapidly to his seat and kept quiet, having won a
bet of £l, it was said, by his performance. But if one
fellow can do that sort of thing with impunity, others are
likely to follow suit.
A. L. Baird sends an exceedingly comprehensive denial re
‘ Ku Klux’s ” par. about Princes Court (Bulletin, 18 1/ 05).
“ The first week’s takings were not £B6O, as stated ; the
first week was not a record ; neither Mr. Bent nor Mr.
John Forrest are shareholders ; it is not intended to build
a theatre on the site of Fitzgerald’s Circus; finally, the
City Council has no present or prospective interest in the
land or venture. ‘Ku Klux ’ claims to be behind the
scenes ; he must be so far behind as to be not worth men-
tioning. Possibly the value of his prophecy is on a par
with his information.”
“ Snell ” : George Lauri tells an Argus interviewer that
he was so successful in his make-up as a Chinaman for
“ The Geisha ” that on one occasion in Sydney a Chow
threw a tomahawk at him, mistaking him for a member
of a rival faction. If George is not believed, he is willing
to produce the tomahawk. He had far better reproduce
the Chinaman. I have only seen one convincing China-
man on the Australian stage, and he was a sort of dresser
employed by a prominent actor at the old Royal, who
rushed on in the midst of a thrilling scene to tell the hero
that his other “tlowsis” were on fire in the dressing-
room. He was a great success.
The sailor-man who climbed on to Her Majesty’s stage,
Melbourne, while Flo. Young was warbling, frightened
the songstress nearly into a fit. She did not know
whether the wretch intended to kill or to kiss her. Cnee
when the Vivians were playing a bathetic drama at the
old Opera House, a bibulous stranger wandered on as the
hero and heroine were disputing in their ruined home,
and, taking a seat, calmly smoked while watching de-
velopments. The actor was equal to the occasion, how-
ever. “My God ! ” he cried, “ this is the last cruel blow.
Our cheeild is dead, our money is gone, our friends nave
deserted us, and now we’ve got the bailiffs in 1 Then
the curtain dropped.
Melbourne Board of Health can hardly continue to
feign unconsciousness of .its alleged unfair dealing with
the local theatre proprietors. Williamson, Musgrove, and
the Theatre Royal Co. have been each of them compelled
to spend a lot of money in improving or reconstructing
their respective houses for the safety of the public,
whilst the Bijou, which is a theatre built over a theatre,
remains as it was before the American fire scare moved
the Board to action. One of two things is certain, lather
the Bijou was the safest theatre in Melbourne before the
scare or the Public Health authorities have chosen to
spare’ the proprietor the cost of doing what his business
rivals were obliged to do. If the Bijou be actually con-
demned, as rumor declares, how long is it to remain
under sentence of death 1 And if it is a duly certificated
building, constructed in the best interests of crowded
audiences, why not publish an advt. to that effect, and
close rumor’s ugly mouth ?
Wybert Reeve, many years manager of Adelaide Theatre
Royal, writes out that he has had a chat with Robert
Brough, who is back in London selecting plays for Aus-
tralia. Brough will himself play “as little as possible
here and Mrs. B. will “ content herself with a few of the
more elderly parts with which her name is associated.
A trades - union correspondent having
dared to traverse some of the D.T.’s frenzied
shrieks on the coal strike, that enraged paper puts
a footnote to a very polite letter that the corres-
pondent “ impudently misrepresents what we
wrote.” The D.T. nowadays can t conceal its
virulence towards trades-unionism.
The pictorial calendar just issued by the
Dunlop Tyre Co. was produced in Melbourne from
designs by Harry Weston, the poster artist, and
it is certainly equal to the best imported specimens
of three-color printing. The effect of the four
advt. pictures is not less distinctively Australian
than exceptionally creditable to local art.

Coghlan’s “ Australia and New Zealand
for 1903-4 is out. One can’t tell the value of a
statistical work from a quarter-hour’s gallop
through the pages; but continual reference
throughout 12 months gives such almost-always
satisfactory results that each succeeding issue is
welcomed with increased confidence.
The question inevitably arises ; How far
can Japan stand this drain of men? The tooth-
comb of the conscription has already been drawn
very fine through the country. The younger men
have all been called to arms. The troops now
going to the front are mostly older reservists, who
have been longer from the colors. A hundred
thousand men may fall in the next two battles
around the Shalio. Russia will feel such loss
heavily. Can Japan stand the strain ? Each
battle now grows bloodier than the last. A deci-
sive battle, properly followed up, is worth any
loss, but battles such as the last two in the North,
area tremendous price paid for nothing.— Daily
Mail (London).
“ V.D.”: Robert Brothers has been dream-
ing. Me, too ! I dreamt recently that I was
giving an exhibition of air swimming in Sydney
Town Hall for the relief of the unemployed.
First, I dived from the top of the organ down
towards the dowagers in the front seats. Just as
they began to scream and get out of the way, I
threw a treble upward somersault and soared up
among the chandeliers. Then I skimmed along
the gallery fronts, whisking flower sprays from
the bosoms of the ladies as I sailed past.
At length I grew bolder, and actually dared to
snatch a kiss from a Governor’s wife, who sat in
state in the south balcony, preparatory to turning
head over heels like a tumbler pigeon. Before
the aroma of that kiss had quite faded from my
lips I was locked up in a huge cage at the Central,
along with a bath of water and a bucket of bird-
seed—the charge, High Treason ! I woke up
feeling happy, for once, that I was not a bird.
“M.” from S’Africa :
Just a word for the Jews in general, if not in particular.
It is popular opinion that the Jews are responsible for the
decline and fall of S’Africa. The idea should be dispelled.
The Christian magnate has been no less rapacious than
the Hebrew millionaire. The mass of the Jewish com-
munity are heavy losers through the artificially engi-
neered depression. They were among the pluckiest of
investors in mining shares and real estate, and, collec-
tively, they put millions into every variety of trade and
enterprise. They have lost nearly all the capital they
brought into the country, and what they made on the
spot has melted from their hands. S’Africa promised to
be a second Land of Canaan to them : it proved a veri-
table Sahara. The Jews are quitting S’Africa in ship-
loads. They are still wandering on the face of the earth,
or floating on the surface of the waters. You should hear
their opinion of the Jewish magnates 1 It is to be heard,
not printed.
Lyrup, the one South Australian village
settlement which of late years has pluckily tried
to struggle through without Government help,
has bumped against some horrid luck. The settle-
ment d l pends almost entirely upon its raisins and
currants, and this year had a splendid crop of 70
tons almost assured, which, at £4O per ton, snowed
a decent profit after meeting Government and
other liabilities. But on Dec. 31st the tempera-
ture ran up to 116 degrees, and a wind like a blast
from Sheol utterly shattered this comfortable
prospect, practically wiping out the entire ci’op.
“Harry S.” : Have often wondered that
no systematic effort has been made to domesticate
the wombat. Judging frOm the length of time I
have kept the animal, when half-grown, in cap-
tivity, and its gentle disposition, it would not be
at all difficult. The wombat is good eating when
well roasted, and weighs up to 601 b.
Thus “New Hand” on the frivolous side
of a “drover’s ” life: —
My mate and I took a job of droving once. Brought a
mob of fats to the rail, 40 miles, took us two days, and
that under difficulties. Neither I nor Tom (my mate)
could count, so I took delivery and Tom kept tally. First
day we got along all right until lunch, which consisted of
“ bully ” beef. This was apparently decomposed, as Tom
and I were taken mortal bad after it. I was the sicker.
Soon decided that I ride on to the nearest pub. for
whisky. This I did, feeling almost dead inside. Arrived
at pub., I explained the situation to the landlady, who
recommended a stiff glass of whisky. This I took aboard,
and got some for Tom. It cheered me awfully. I gaily
raced back, s'nging “ Ballyhooley ” and got outside of
the principal part of Tom’s whisky before arrival. Found
Tom under a tree all doubled up and the sheep nowhere.
I poured the balance of the whisky into To.n and awaited
results. He recovered sufficiently to mount the pack-
horse, and I led him into camp. But where were the
blooming sheep? They were somewhere this side of
where we started, we knew. So, after sleeping off the
effects of the bully beef, we started exploring and rounded
up a mob of sheep that looked like ours. They panned
out well, for we delivered two over the number to the
trucking-agents and got a first-class reference, which
neither Tom nor I have thought wise to make use of
since. For as we went back home we met our own sheep,
and realising that something was wrong, we fled for our
lives, and we aren’t going there any more.
“ Bullaman Going without a hat will
cure baldness, providing the roots of the hair are
not dead. Had a bald patch on my head as big as
a crown piece, and my hair was falling out about
the temples. Went without a hat, and now my
hair is as thick as ever. Also knew a man at
Four-Mile (Cue, W.A.) only 27 years old, com-
pletely bald barring a little fluff. He left off the
hat and in nine months he had a good crop of hail.
Hair, like any other plant, requires light and air.
Blacks never wear hats, and baldness is a thing
unknown amongst them. During a 30 years’
travel all over Australia I have never struck a
bald-headed aborigine.
Said that the Prince of Wales is going for
another tour round the world and will take com-
mand of a cruiser squadron and visit all the
parts of “ the Empire.”
“Dingo ” . Talking of peculiar Australian
nomenclature. Met a school-teacher between
Wallerawang and Ben Bullen on his road home
for the holidays. He told me he was teaching the
school at Gulgullander, situate near the confluence
of the Budgebegamble and Cockomobil Creeks
on the boundary of Wonderwondong Station. He
had to go to Balderogerie for his letters. These
places can be found on any decent map, between
Wellington and Bulgandramine.
The race of the emu is nearing its end. A
drover who travelled with horses from the Gulf
Country to N.S.W. at Goodooga, thence via Nar-
rabri and Walgett to Singleton, states that in his
travels (which covered thousand's of miles, owing
to losing horses in scrub and mulga at times) only
one nest of eight eggs was found, and he saw but
half-a-dozen birds. The scarcity of eggs has
advanced prices from 12s. to 15s. a dozen in

ONE of the Uses to which
THE GRAMOPHONE may be put.
Nowhere is the Gramophone heard to greater advantage than when played across the
water on a still summer’s evening. All the tone and quality of the great Artistes’ voices come
gently swelling over the echoing water. There is no need to breathe the vitiated air of the
crowded theatre or concert hall. On the river bank where there
is peace the Gramophone brings you the best music you could
hear from far-off cities.
There are people still, who, having heard some
old-fashioned and long out-of-date talking
machine, think that the Gramophone is
inartistic.
Play the Gramophone in the wrong key, or
play Records which are entirely out of sympathy
with the audience, and possibly even to-day
you will create a bad impression with the
Gramophone.
BUT—play the Gramophone properly as a
musician would, what is the result ? You delight
the musical critic and you entertain your friends.
Who shall criticise the Gramophone when
Edward Lloyd Writes :
“l am content that future generations shall
judge my voice by the Gramophone.”
On receipt of a postcard we will send
Catalogues of Gramophones and Records
and the name and address of the nearest
dealer in our Gramophones. Gramophone
Records, and genuine Gramophone Needles,
sold only in metal boxes with our trade-
mark picture, “His Master’s Voice,” on
the lid.

Health! The Most Vital Interest
LEARN FROM OTHERS’ EXPERIENCE.
The Case of
Mr. E. W. DAVIS.
(By a Sydney Keporter.)
It is safe to say that the people
who have the most vital interest in
the following particulars are those who
tind themselves in a similar position
to that occupied some seven years ago
by Mr. Edward Walter Davis, painter,
of Kenwick-street, Marrickville, who
addressed these remarks to an inter-
viewer
"It was whilst I was living at
Leichhardt that I was so ill with
painters’ colic, and also rheumatism,
and 1 can give you my word that for
several months it was a doubtful mat-
ter how things would go with me.
Both tliose complaints at once would
be enough to kill most men, and it
is no exaggeration to say that they
nearly caused my death. My digestive
organs were also in a terribly bad
way, so that, you see, I was suffering
from a serious complication of ail-
ments."
"‘Did you seek medical advice, Mr.
Davis Y*
“Oh, yes ; I saw at doctor, and for
some time remained under his treat-
ment. which, unfortunately, proved to
be utterly useless. 1 took enough
medicines to do me good in those
days if they had been of the right
kind, but evidently they were not,
and the agony l was continually suf-
fering was simply intolerable. The
rheumatic pains in my legs had quite
a crippling effect upon me, for 1 had to
refrain from moving about as much as
possible because of any exertion ag-
gravating my afflictions. Nearly all
my joints were as stiff and sore as
could be, so you can imagine how dif-
ficult it was for rhe to do anything ;
but so far as doing anything was
concerned I hadn’t the inclination, for
l felt as if the whole world had closed
its doors against me. In my melan-
choly frame of mind I could see no-
thing excepting in the gloomiest of
colours, and all there seemed in this
life was to struggle hopelessly along
against overwhelming adversities. Had
i been told that in a short while I
was going to die I’m sure it would
have been good news, for I was really
anxious to leave all my unhappiness
behind me."
"It seems as if you had come to the
conclusion that you were not going
to get better ?"
"indeed, 1. could think nothing else,
because I could not get even a little
relief. My agonies had me worked up
to such a pitch of exasperation that
if anybody came and spoke to> me 1
could seaicely bo civil to them. And
what fearful nights I put in week af-
ter week ! frequently no sleep from
the time I went to bed till I got up
again next day, and I’d like to know
who could ha' o got to sleep if they
had felt as I did, with the sensation
in my stomach as if everything was
being drawn up into a knot and then
screwed round and round. Combined
with these afflictions 1 had pains un-
der my heart, which caused mo more
anxiety than enough, for what chance
had I of effecting a recovery if I had
heart disease as well, and the way
palpitation occurred made me think
that organ was diseased. This was
not all, though, as my chest had
heavy pains in it which affected my
breathing, and not a day passed but
what J was nearly distracted with a
headache. If I took a small quantity
of food—and my appetite was too
poor to eat much—it simply turned
sour in the stomach and gave rise
to fits of belching, and a feeling as
if 1 wanted to be sick would come on.
Oh, there was no child’s play about
my illness, and I often say what a
lucky man 1 was ever to get rid of
it."
"That is what I would like to hear
about. Do you mind telling me ?"
".Not at all. 1 am only too glad,
for it was such a wonderful affair, as
most of th’e neighbours round where I
lived could tell you. They knew how
I fluttered, and when they saw that I
was being pulled round they were very
curious to know what was the cause
of it, and I told them Clements Tonic
was the medicine that was saving my
life, which was the truth. Besides
what I’ve already stated, £ used to
get feelings of giddiness very often,
and my tongue was never clean, but
covered with slime, and in my mouth
the taste was like bile; but when 1
had taken a couple of bottles or so of
Clements Tonic 1 was not a bit like
that, and the old feelings of sickness
after eating were gone. That was a
good deal to be grateful for, but no-
thing compared to what followed. X
used to dream a lot whenever 1 ob-
tained some sleep, and would wake
up in terror as if I had been dream-
ing of murder or something equally
bad, but Clements Tonic had such a
calming effect upon me that when I
slept 1 did so soundly, and felt as
fresh as paint when i woke up. My
nerves might have had a lot to do
with those restless nights, for before
using Clements Tonic they used to
twitch dreadfully ; afterwards they
were firm and steady, and the little
involuntary jumps I used to give when
lying down were no longer in evi-
dence. 1 was not the same man at
all when I had been taking Clements
Tonic a few weeks. The acute rheu-
matic pains had. been graduallv be-
coming less and less .painful, and in
good time they died out altogeiher.
Such a thin" might seem impossible,
but, on my honour, it is true, and
when I speak of the colic pains I can
say exactly the same thing—they were
done away with by Clements' Tonic
once and for all. Many of my work-
mates have reaped the benefit of my
experience, for when I have told them
what cured me they got Clements
Tonic for themselves, and they have
always spoken of the results in satis-
factory terms."
"And how did your digestive organs
fare ?"
“Couldn’t possibly have been made
more healthy than Clements Tonic
made them, which means all the dif-
ference between a life of joy and a
life of sorrow. It meant that my eyes
were no longer heavy and dull as
they had been, and it meant, that 1
could always eat heartily without fear
of being ill afterwards, ’ for Clements
Tonic made my internal organs do
their work more perfectly than ever..
That I had got very thin could only
be expected, but under the treatment
of Clements Tonic i soon put on more
flesh than 1 had before my illness, and
the additional strength 1 acquired was
amazing. My wife was also very ill
once, and Clements Tonic did her a
wonderful amount of good, which
shows that it can be used equally well
by either sex, to whom 1 unfailingly
recommend its use when circumstances
require.”
"And can we make use of this con-
versation V"
“Undoubtedly. You are welcome to
publish every sentence in any way you
prefer."

Hearne’s
THE FA.MOTTS REMEDY FOR
COUGHS, BRONCHITIS, ASTHMA, AND CONSUMPTION,
HAS THE LARGEST SALE OF ANY CHEST MEDICINE IN THE WORLD.
Those who have taken this medicine are amazed at its wonderful influence. Sufferers from any form of Bronchitis, Cough, Difficulty of Breathing, Hoarseness, Pain or
Soreness in the Chest, experience delightful and immediate relief; and to those who are subject to Colds on the Chest it is invaluable, as it effects a Complete Cure. It is most com-
forting in allaying irritation in the throat and giving strength to the voice, and it neither allows a Cough or Asthma to become chronic, nor Consumption to develop. Consumption has
never'been known to exist where “ Coughs ” have been properly treated with this medicine. No house should be without it, as, taken at the beginning, a dose is generally sufficient,
and a Complete Cure is certain.
BEWARE OF COUGHS l
REMEMBER THAT EVERY DISEASE HAS ITS COMMENCEMENT, AND CONSUMPTION IS NO EXCEPTION TO THIS RULE.

A Sydney Stock and Share Broker expresses
Gratitude and Appreciation of Hearne’s
Bronchitis Cure.
It proved a most effective remedy for a
severe attack of Bronchitis.
Mr. W. G. Hearne. Dear Sir, —I lately had a severe
attack of Bronchitis, and, acting on the advice of a friend,
obtained a supply of your Bronchitis Cure. lam pleased
to inform you it has proved a most effective remedy,
causing me to feel grateful to you for furnishing such a
valuable medicine to the public. May you meet with the
success you so well deserve. I place this communica-
tion at vour service, and remain, Dear Sir, Yours
faithfully, HENRY FRENCH,

ASTHMA.
A Five Years case.
At times very bad indeed.
Quickly and completely Cured by Hearne’s
Bronchitis and Asthma Cure.
Mr. Hearne. Dear Sir, —For five or six years I was
troubled with asthma, at times very bad indeed. 1 was
very ill just after Christmas, so sent to the local chemist
for a bottle of your Bronchitis and Asthma Cure. I took
the first dose on going to bed, and was not troubled that
night. I finished the medicine, and have not had a
touch of the asthma since. I tell everyone about it.

HAY ASTHMA.
A Severe Attack Relieved in Ten Minutes
by Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure.
The Effect was Wonderful.
Mr. W. G. Hearne Dear Sir, —About three weeks ago,
while in the vicinity of musty chaff, I gradually felt
a difficulty to breathe. My nose began to run, and to all
appearances I was developing a severe attack of Bron-
chitis or Asthma. At last I could stand it no longer. I
then tried your Bronchitis Cure, and its effect was
wonderful. In less than ten minutes I was all right
again. Such a result, and so quick, astounded me.
This is no exaggeration, I am pleased to say.—Yours
truly, S. H. MAYO, Meredith, Victoria. 1
BRONCHITIS and ASTHMA.
A Sydney Resident Suffered for Over Sixty
Years.
So Bad He Dared Not Stir
Relieved in a Few Minutes by Hearne’s
Bronchitis Cure.
Would Give £5O for the Same Benefit rather
than Suffer.
Mr. W. G. Hearne.
Dear Friend,—Chronic Bronchitis I had from birth, and
I ain now 66 years old. Some time back I contracted
Asthma, and for months I was so bad that any remedy
that had previously relieved smothering was of no use to
me. I was so bad that I dared not stir, and spent the
worst night I ever had. When, in a conversation, Mr.
Marsh, J.P., of Balmain, Sydney, kindly told me that a
friend of his was using your Bronchitis Cure, and that it
was good. So my sister bought me a bottle of it, and in
a few minutes after taking the first dose I could breathe a
little. The next day I was better, and kept getting better
every day. To-day lam better than I have been for the
last seven years. I took the medicine as directed, six
bottles, and it cost me less than £l. I would give £5O for
the same benefit rather than suffer as I did. Please make
what use of this letter you think fit. If by so doing it
would only cause one to get rid of this fearful complaint.
—Yours faithfully,
WILLIAM CANHAM,
108 Curtis Road, Balmain, Sydney.
HEARNE’S BRONCHITIS CURE.
Its Efficacy in chest complaints testified to
by a Grateful Victorian.
Mr. W. G. Hearne. Dear Sir, —I have much pleasure in
adding my testimony in praise of your invaluable Bron-
chitis Cure. I have used it for the last three or four years,
and its efficacy I have fully proved in common colds,
severe colds, croupy coughs, and other similar chest com-
plaints. I have given it to infants a few weeks old, young-
children and adults of all ages, and have never known it
to fail in relieving at once, and rapidly effecting a cure
with a few doses. I have recommended it to many of my
friends, and they have fully proved its wonderful curative
properties. I feel very grateful to you for a chest medi-
cine so valuable, and cheap enough to be available to any-
one. Trusting its present popularity and sales will be
doubled, I am, yours very gratefully,

An English Lady so ill that the

Was given Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure, and it
effected a complete recovery.
Mr. Hearne. Dear Sir.—Not long since I had occasion
to visit the old country, and before leaving Melburne pur-
chased a bottle of Hearne’s Bronchitis Oure, which I took
with me. When I arrived in Leeds I found that my niece,
Miss C. Matthews, was suffering from a very severe attack
of Bronchitis, in fact, she was so bad that the family doctor
held out no hope of her recovery. She was then given
Hearne’s Bronchitis Oure according to the direction on
the label, and I am very pleased to say that it effected a
complete cure. R. J. MATTHEWS,

I send you my hearty good wishes for your future success.

BRONCHO-PNEUMONIA.
Two Severe Cases cured by One Bottle of
Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure.
Mr. W. Gr. Hearne. Dear Sir,— Kindly forward without
delay another small bottle of your Bronchitis Cure. The
bottle I had from you lias cured two of my children, but I
do not feel safe without it in the house. I have also re-
commended it to my friends. I lost a fine little girl, three
years of age, from influenza and Broncho-Pneumonia. I
really believe if I had had your medicine my child would
not have died, for the other two, a boy five years old, and
a baby 8 months old, were suffering exactly in the same
way, and it acted like magic on them ; in fact, a small
bottleful cured both of them ; so trusting you will forward
it without delay—l am, yours most gratefully,

A Queensland Sufferer from Bronchitis.
Seventy-two years of age, weak and
Wasted.
The Doctor considered it a hopeless case.
Cured by Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure.
Mr. Hearne. Dear Sir, —I beg leave to draw your
attention to a remarkable Cure of Bronchitis, which disease
attacked me last May. It was looked upon by the doctor
as a hopeless case. In such an extremity I naturally
looked about for something; to try. I thought it a hard
thing, after 72 years’ experience of the ups and downs of
this life, to die in such an inglorious manner ; besides, I
was very poor in flesh, and thin, and this stimulated me
to make an effort for recovery, if only to improve my con-
dition. I saw your Bronchitis Cure advertised, and
thought I would give it a trial, so I sent to W. H. Harris,
chemist, Gill-street, Charters Towers, and got a small
bottle of it. I had scarcely finished it when I gave up all
thought of leaving my wife a widow, and hopefully looked
forwarded to many more delightful days of up and downs,
principally downs. The second small bottle caused the
Bronchitis and me to part company, greatly to its regret,
I opine. The third bottle stood me on my legs to receive
the congratulations of my friends.
I have been a resident of Charters Towers for 30 years,
and, being'gifted with the spirit of good fellowship, have
not the least objection to you making any use of this
testimonial you think proper, as a means of relieving
others similarly situated to mvself.
JOHN SHEPHERD,
Queenton, Charters Towers, Queensland.
Eelieved by one dose of Hearne’s Bronchitis
Cure, and cured by two bottles.
Mr. Hearne. Dear Sir, —I wish to add my testimony
to the wonderful effect of your Bronchitis Cure. I
suffered for nine months, and the cough was so dis-
tressingly bad at nights, I was obliged to get up and sit
by the fire. I had medical advice, and tried other
remedies, without avail. I tried yours, and never had a
fit of coughing after taking the first dose, and though I
have had but two bottles, I feel I am a different man, ana
the cough lias vanished. You may depend upon niy
making known the efficacy of your wonderful remedy to
anyone I see afflicted.—Yours faithfully,

Self = Poisoned*
(By “Sequence.”)
Some of the most powerful poisons known to science are made in the human body as the result
of the wear and tear of life. These poisons are produced by the mere act of living.
We have all heard of the poisoned spears, darts and arrows used by many tribes of savages. The
most common mode of poisoning these articles is to thrust them into a dead human body, and leave them
there until the flesh is completely decomposed. Some tribes consider that there is a special virtue in
the corpse of a chief, when used for this purpose, and that the greater the chief the more dangerous to
their enemies will be the weapons thus prepared. Whether the body is that of a chief or that of a
slave matters not at all. In either case a most malignant poison results from the decomposition,
and the slightest scratch from spear, dart or arrow treated in this manner, is fatal to a human
being or any other living animal.
Dangerous as are the poisons created by the decomposition of animal matter, the poisons made by
each of us every moment we live are equally deadly, and their evil work is wrought within ourselves.
If all our organs are thoroughly healthy, the poisons, which are being continuously made, are expelled,
and we suffer no hurt. It should therefore be our first care to see that the organs whose duty it is to.
remove these poisons are kept in efficient working order.
Upon the skin, lungs, kidneys and liver rests the main responsibility of extracting poisonous,
matter from the blood and removing it from the system. The moment one of these organs, through,
weakness or disease, becomes incapable of performing its work efficiently, that moment we begin to.
suffer from some illness, and, if steps are not taken to restore to health and activity the organ at fault,,
death from some form of blood poisoning must ensue.
The lungs are vigorous organs, and speedily advise us of anything which is impeding their action,,
whilst the skin will usually perform its duty if kept in a state of cleanliness. The kidneys and liver,,
on the other hand, are generally not able to directly call our attention to any weakness or disease in.
themselves, and it is only by studying symptoms produced by their irregularity that we become aware,
of their incapacity to do their work.
The kidneys filter and extract from the blood about three pints of urine every day. In this
quantity of urine are dissolved about an ounce of urea, ten to twelve grains in weight, of uric acid,
together with other animal and mineral matter varying from a third of an ounce to nearly an ounce.
When the kidneys are in health, all this solid matter is in solution and is invisible. Directly the
kidneys, through either weakness or disease, become unfit to do their duty properly, a proportion of
he solid matter remains in the blood, becomes actively poisonous and causes us to suffer from uric
disorders such as Rheumatism, Gout, Neuralgia, Lumbago, Backache, Sciatica, Gravel, Stone,
Bladder Troubles, and Bright’s Disease. A simple test to make as to the condition of the kidneys
is to place some urine, passed the first thing in the morning, in a covered glass, and let it stand
until next morning. If it is then cloudy, or there is a brick-dust like sediment, or if particles
float about in it, or it is of an unnatural color, the kidneys are not healthy, and no time must be
lost in adopting remedial measures, or Bright’s Disease, Diabetes, or some less serious but more
painful illness will result.
The Liver.—ln the liver various substances are actually made from the blood. Two or three
pounds of bile are thus made from the blood every day. The liver takes sugar from the blood,
converts it into another form, and stores it up so as to be able to again supply it to the blood'
gradually, as the latter requires enrichment. The liver changes uric acid, which is insoluble, into
urea, which is completely soluble, and the liver also deals with blood corpuscles which have lived
their life and are useful no longer. When the liver is inactive or diseased we suffer from Indi-
gestion, Biliousness, Anaemia, Sick Headache, and Blood Disorders.
The health of the liver and of the kidneys is so closely connected that it is almost impossible for
the kidneys to be affected and the liver to remain healthy, or vice versa.
It is nearly thirty years since scientific research, directed especially to diseases of the kidneys and
liver, was rewarded by the discovery of the medicine now known throughout the world as Warner’s
Safe Cure. It was realised at the outset of the investigation that it was necessary to find a curative
agent which would act equally upon the kidneys and upon the liver, these organs being so immediately
associated m the work of dealing with the body’s waste material, and after many disappointments themedi-
cine which possessed the required action in the fullest degree was at length discovered. Warner's Safe
Cure cures all diseases of the kidneys and liver, and, by restoring their activity, these vital organs are
enabled to rid the body, through the natural channels, of urinary and biliary poisons, the presence of
which, in the system, are the cause of Rheumatism, Gout, Neuralgia, Lumbago, Backache Sciatica
Blood Disorders, Anaemia, Indigestion, Biliousness, Jaundice, Sick Headache, Gravel, Stone Bladder
Troubles, and General Debility. Warner’s Safe Cure cures all these disorders simply by removing
the cause of the disorder. This is the reason why cures effected bv Warner’s Safe Cure are permanent
cures.

When I Was King.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
second time I lived on earth
I Was several hundred years ago ;
And —royal by my second birth—
I know "as much as most men know.
[ was a King who held the reins
As never modern monarchs can ;
[ was a King, and I had brains,
And, what was more, I was a man 5
Called to the throne in stormy times,
When things were at their very worst,
I had to fight—and not with rhymes—
My own self and my kindred first;
And after that my friends and foes,
And great abuses born of greed ;
And when I’d fairly conquered those,
I ruled the land a King indeed.
I found a deal of rottenness,
.Such as in modern towns we find ;
I camped my poor in palaces
And tents upon the plain behind.
I marked the hovels, dens and stews
In that fair city by the sea,
And burnt the miles of wretched mews
And built the homes as they should be.
I stripped the baubles from the State,
And on the land I spent the spoil;
I hunted off the sullen “great,”
And to the farmers gave the soil.
My people were their own police ;
My courts were free to everyone.
My priests were to preach love and peace ;
My Judges to see justice done.
I’d studied men and studied kings,
No crawling cant would 1 allow;
I hated mean and paltry things,
As I can hate them even now.
A land of men I meant to see,
A strong and clean and noble race—
No subject dared kneel down to me,
But looked his king straight in the face.
Had I not been a king in fact,
A king in council and by tent,
I might have let them crawl and act
The courtier to their heart’s content;
But when I called on other kings,
And saw men kneel, I felt incline 1
To gently tip the abject things
And kick them very hard behind;
I loved to wander through the streets
I carried neither sword nor dirk —
And watch the building of my fleets,
And watch my artisans at work. ,
At times I would take off my coat
And show them how to do a thing—
Till someone, clucking in his throat,
Would stare and gasp, “ It is the King ! ”
I loved to stroll about the town
With chums at night, and talk of things,
And, though I chanced to wear the crown,
My friends, by intellect, were kings.
When I was doubtful, then I might
Discuss a matter quietly,
But when I felt that I was right
No power on earth could alter me !
And now and then it was no sin
Nor folly to relax a bit—
I’d take my friends into an inn
And call for wine and pay for it.
And then of many things we’d clack
With loosened tongues and vision clear
(I often heard behind my back
The whispered “ Peace, the king is here ! ”]
The women harped about a queen,
I knew they longed to have a court
And flaunt their feathers on the scene,
But hitherto I’d held the fort.
My subjects wanted me, no doubt,
To give the throne a son and heir—
(There were some little kings about,
But that was neither here nor there).
I’d no occasion for a wife—
A queen as yet was not my plan:
I’d seen a lot of married life—
My sire had been a married man.
“ A son and heir be hanged 1 ” I said —
“ How dare you ask for such a thing,
You fight it out when I am dead
And let the best man be the king ! ”
“ Your Majesty, we love you well! ”
A candid friend would say to me—
“ But there be tales that people tell
Unfitted to thy dignity ”
“ My dignity be damned ! ” I’d say,
“ Bring me no women’s chattering !
I’ll be a man while yet I may—
When trouble comes I’ll be a king !
I’d kept my kingdom clean and strong
While other kingdoms are like ours —
I had no need to brook a wrong
I feared not all the rotten Powers !
I did not eat my heart out then,
Nor feebly fight in verse or prose.
I'd take five hundred thousand men
To argue matters with my foes !
It thrilled me through, the mighty tramp
Of armed men, the thundering cheer—
fhe pregnant whisper through the camp
At dead of night: “ The King is here ! ”
And though we paid for victory
On some fields that were hard to hold,
I’he faith my soldiers had in me
Oft strengthened mine a hundredfold.
I d chat with soldiers by the fires
On rocky heights and river banks,
I d seek the brains that war requires,
And take my captains from the ranks.
And so, until the storm was by,
And came the peace just war can bring,
I bore me so that men might cry
With all their hearts, “God Save the King.”
When I was king the world was wide,
And I was strong and I was free.
I knew no hatred, knew no pride, ,
No envy and no treachery.
I feared no lies, I feared no truth,
Nor any storm that time may bring.
I had my lore and had my youth.
The world was unde when I was king.
Peace came at last—and strange is Fate—
The women begged j ust once alone
To see me robed in royal state
And seated c:i my father’s throne.
I thought, “Shall I this boon deny?”
And said—and ’twas a paltry thing :
“ I’ll show the fools just once that I
Can look, as well as be, a king.”
They dusted out the castle old,
And from the closet and the chest
They dug the jewels set in gold—
The crown and robes and all the rest.
They came with eyes like stars at night,
With diamonds set in raven hair
They came with arms and bosoms white—
And, oh my soul, but one was fair !
They dressed me as the kings had been
The ancient royal purple spread,
And one that was to be my queen,
She placed the circlet on my head.
They pressed their hearts and bowed to mo,
They knelt with arms uplifted all.
I felt the rush of vanity
The pride that went before the fall.
And then the banquet and the wine
With Satan’s music and the glance
Of siren eyes. Those captains mine
Were reeling in the madd’ning dance;
A finger writing on the wall,
While girls sang as the angel 3 sing ;
A drunken boaster in the hall,
The fool that used to be a king.

A Bush Fire.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
*iyTEW Year’s Eve! Last New Year’s Eva
I we had a dance. This one, Lil proved
herself a heroine. Poor old Lil! she’d
just put the finishing touch to her green muslin,
and wreathed her old white hat with yellow
daisies and red roses (Lil’s taste in dress is rustic,
not to say primitive). We others had ironed up
white muslins, and thought them plenty good
enough, hut then if was Steve’s picnic, and Steve
was nothing to us We were stretched on the
hard verandah boards, grumbling at the heat.
The flies were a story all hy themselves. None
of us wore stockings.
“By Jove,” said Joe, “a storm at last.”
We watched the storm rolling up through the
curtained window. Every now and then the sun
showed blood-red and the heat increased. Some-
thing like thunder sounded afar off, but no
lightning lit the sky. A kind of darkness, thick
and stifling, settled down on us. Presently up
the road galloped Paddy Clancy and Jim Thomp-
son. We wondered why they hurried, for no one
hurries on Burrawang except at shearing time.
Lil said if it wasn’t so hot she’d walk down to the
homestead and ask, but instead she sat down at
the nursery piano, and sang in a monotonous
voice “Ring down the curtain, I can’t sing
to-night.” We often wished Lil would make up
her mind she couldn’t sing at all.
Midge dragged herself in, cool after a dip in our
only water-hole, her hair in rats’-tails round her
face, and addressed me, “Come out of that,
stupid—it’s not a storm ; it’s a fire.”
I went out, but we were all too hot to care
much, only Lil walked to the hill at the back and
called out languidly, “Fire’s pretty close.”
Just then Dad came tearing up on Spud and
gasped, “Give me a drop of that brandy, Mother,
in a flask.”
Poor Mother, used to Dad’s suddenness, thought
he was breaking out again, but gave it uncom-
plainingly. Instead of gulping it, Dad leapt to
the saddle and tore away over the creek, Spud
looking hurt and disgusted. Mother wondered
what could be the matter, when there came running
up the city wife of the jackeroo. We gasped to
see her running. “The bush is all afire and the
flames are rushing towards us. Two families have
already reached the homestead, their homes in
ashes, one poor thing about to add to her other
babies, moaning and distracted because two of her
children had been left behind—couldn’t be found
high or low ! ”
That was Mrs. Evans’ story. At last we forgot
the heat of the burning blasts of wind. Some-
thing had happened ! Anyone who has lived on
a way-back station will know what that means.
Mother was offering Mrs. Evans the last of the
Christmas limej uiee, when an excited coo-ee came
from the road. “Is Jim there? Send him to
move the stock from the horse-paddock. Fire’s
tearing round ‘ Black Jack ! ’ ”
Away the man went towards the “Union,”
higher up. Lord knows where Jim was—not at
home, anyhow ; and as we stood, frightened and
wondering, dense clouds of smoke rose up and ran
along the mountain range opposite. Mother
wrung her hands; the horses would be burnt, and
the milking cows, and some fats for killing were
in the paddocks too. “Oh, where was that Jim!
If only she had hold of him ! ”
Lil ran to the storeroom. Neither bridle nor
saddle to be seen. She. snatched at a whip and a
piece of rope, and made for the barn, where Gipsy
and Possum stood, switching the flies from each
other’s eyes with their tails. On to Possum leapt
Lil, fixing the rope as she galloped for the creek,
and shouting, “ Hey, Tip ! Blackie ! Hey, come,
boys ! ” Through the broken gate on to the road,
faster than the scorching gale she tore, still
screaming to the dogs, “Hey, Tip ! Blackie ! ” I
saw her mushroom hat go scudding tovvards Bom-
bala, and her fair hair streaming behind her, as
she raced like a mad thing, and hid my face in my
hands as the flames burst over “ Black Jack” and
down the mountain to the paddock. I can hear
mother’s moans now as she saw Lil, the pride of
her heart, race to the farthest corner of the 700
acre paddock—the one nearest the flames. “Oh
Mother in Heaven,” her trembling lips kept mut-
tering.
The fire caught the long, dry grass at the
foot of the mountain as we watched. A few
minutes and the flames would be rolling across
the paddock towards the road. A cloud of
dust, and we knew the men had returned
to save the homestead. Just then the cattle ap-
peared over the rise, bellowing and frightened,
the horses following unwillingly. Two turned
back to their beloved corner, and we saw Lil
swerve and follow, her arm raised, as she swirled
the stock-whip. At last the stubborn brutes
realised their danger, and made for the slip-rails,
The flames rolled behind like the great waves of
an ocean turned to fire.
Lil did not wait to reach the slip-rails, but sent
old Possum at the fence, gasping to Steve as she
passed the hay-stack, “Mrs. Cummins! Baby!
Gome on ! ” Lil never had to ask anything of
Steve a second time. Away they swept, over the
blazing pack-fence a mile lower down, and
straight for the Cummins’ place. Cummins had
gone to the bank witli the money he’d got for his
bit of wool. Lil, gathering scraggy late wattle
that morning, had met him. Mrs. Cummins
was the mother of a week - old baby,
The Cummins cottage was under the range
and the range was ablaze.
How they got there I don’t know. They
found the poor woman with her infant
crouched in a patch of green barley. The
fire was tearing through the scrub round the
back of the house. Steve made for the woman,
Lil for the cottage, shrieking, “ Let’s save the
poor devil’s home if we can.” Steve didn't seem
to worry about the rough word, and if he doesn’t
worry who should ? Luckily there was no grass
near the hut, but the roof was of shingle,
and Lil knew the danger. On one side
was the creek, now nearly dry, but it would
check the flames for a bit; and, with a couple of
kerosene-tins, she rushed towards it. Back she
toiled, and found the garden fence had caught.
She called to Steve, and pounced on two old corn
bags. Into the water she plunged them, and
made for the fence.
Well, anyone on Monaro could tell you
how they fought the fire that night and
saved the Cummins’ crib. It gives me the
creeps to think of it. As I write, the rain is
pouring down, and the worst here is over; but
hundreds of men are still out fighting the fire
farther on. Lil’s eyebrows and lashes look an
awful sight, and there’s an ugly mark on her left
cheek ; but Mrs. Cummins tells me she doesn't
think that’s why Lil sobbed so cruelly on Steve’s
shoulder the night they beat the fire.

A DISORDERED
Liver, if not at-
tended to, very
often brings in its
train serious results. The
stomach, the digestive
organs and the kidneys
become lax in their duties.
Pimples and blotches ap-
pear, and the complexion
generally assumes a nasty
sallow tint. All thesymp*
toms of Liver Disorder are
too numerous to mention,
but the most common are
pains in the back, especially
after eating, difficulty in
breathing, a general feel-
ing of depression and dis-
content, and loss of appe-
tite. A disordered liver
needs to be corrected in a
natural and easy manner,
and not by taking strong
purgatives, mineral salts,
or other injurious prepara-
tions. The finest natural
vegetable remedy known to medical science in this century is Bile Beans for Biliousness.
They cure all disorders of the liver quite easily and naturally. They also cure per-
manently by righting first causes ; and for this reason, there is absolutely nothing else that
is “just as good.” This is illustrated in the following case of Mrs. E. Moore, of 12 Bray-
street, Erskineville, Sydney, who says : “ Some seven years ago I was troubled with very
severe pains in the small of my back, accompanied by constipation, a poor appetite, and
worn-out feeling, making me feel very miserable and entirely unfitted for my household
duties, and in time my system became completely debilitated. For some time I was an
out-patient at the hospital, but I was told that I could only be patched up as I had a con-
gested liver. It was then I decided to give Bile Beans a trial, having heard of their great
efficacy for liver disorders. The first few doses made a great improvement in my condition,
and, continuing the course, the pains quickly left me. I regained my lost appetite, and
was quickly restored to health and vigor. I will never be without such a valuable medi-
cine in the house, and always recommend Bile Beans to fellow sufferers, and will
be glad, at any time, to answer queries in regard to my statements, which might prove
of value to others.”
BILE BEANS are obtainable from all Medicine Vendors throughout Australasia.

My Ship at Sunset.
1 1 saw a ship a-sailing,
A-sailing on the sea,
And O, it teas all laden
With pretty things for me."
FAR in the west the sunset flung
Its gaudy banner on the sky,
A sort of brooding silence hung
Across the water, and the sigh
Of a sad breeze went by.
A ship came sailing from the west,
The sunset’s glory over her,
Without a pause she onward pressed,
Yet scarcely made the water stir.
So slow her movements were.
I saw the snow of sails that shone,
I caught the gleam of burnished gold,
And knew that piled in heaps upon
The deck, and hidden in the hold,
Were treasures manifold.
I stood and gazed, my heart aglow,
For something whispered to my soul,
“ The ship is thine : she finds, I know,
With thee a haven and a goal,—
Thine while the ages roll.”
More near she sailed with swanlike grace,
And one was standing at the prow,
Commanding, and serene his face ;
Grave eyes beneath the level brow—
My heart can see him now.
So soon the soul perceives its own,
So swift the spirit understands,
We two were in the world alone,
And I was hast’ning down the sands
With outstretched, straining hands.
With outstretched hands he waited, still,
And smiled a greeting—when I heard
A sudden cry of warning shrill.
My leaping heart, aroused and stirred,
Sank like a wounded bird.
And even as she touched the strand
The ship began to move away,
As if some great, relentless hand,
Which nothing had the power to stay,
Drew her across the bay.
And what had been a narrow strip
Of sea between us, grew again—
Still wider—bore away my ship—
Till all the vast dividing main
Rolled deep between us twain.
But as I saw him drawn away,
Not guessing why, not knowing how,
Loud and distinct I heard him say—
That splendid figure at the prow :
“ I shall return : wait thou.”
And so I wait while sunset flames
And casts its colors o’er the sea,
Till stealing night her season claims,
And light grows dim, and winds blow free,
And stars look down on me.
And so I wait through all the days,
With faith as steadfast as a star,
And so I wait to-night, and gaze
Far out beyond the harbor-bar—
Far out—God knows how far.

A Hardworking Lot.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
BILL PRIMROSE spoke hurriedly for five
minutes, and then forgot to ask me for a
drink. “The Pole-Jews are a hard-
workin’ lot, sir. A crowd of ’em came to Austra-
lia when I was a boy. Me dad kep’ a shop near
the quay. He uster wait on the boats wiv lemons
an’ pines an’ Parramatta oranges. Yew should
see the Norwegian sailor get his teeth intew a
orange, sir, arter wind-jamming round the Cape
for 130 days, eatin’ pickled beef an’ weevils.
“Me dad’s shop was on the quay. A lirrle
Poley Jew-boy stood by a winder one day, lookin’
’ard at the bananas. He offered me dad a ha’penny
for nine bad apples and a big, wormy pear. Dad
hit him wiv a skinned rabbit an’ dropped a weight
on his foot.
“The lirrle Poley boy wouldn’t go away from
our winder. He counted all Our bananas, an’
reckoned up the price of our apples and grapes.
Then he sucked his thumb a bit, hopped in the
shop again and offered dad another ha’penny for
all the bad apples in the basket at the door. Me
dad smiled an’ gave the lirrle Jew boy a drink of
vinegar out of a cider bottle. The lirrle boy ran
out, sir, an’ jest as he touched the step he dropped
.a shillin’ down our cellar gratin’. Arter tastin’
the vinegar he wus too frightened to come back
for it.
“’Bout an hour later his muvver came intew
the shop an’ arst me dad tew let her look for the
shillin’. Dad showed her intew the cellar an’
lent her a candle. She came up arter a while
wivbut the bob. She said it wuz still there.
“ Same arternoon a bloke wiv a moveable nose
came intew the shop an’sez that his lirrle boy
Ike had dropped a shillin’ down our cellar. Dad
gave him a candle, an’ arst him not tew tread
’ard on Bill the dawg lyin’ at the foot of the
steps. The bloke wiv the nose stayed in the
cellar till muvver went for the supper beer. Dad
arst him not to tear tip the foundations of the
house, an’ not to lose his temper wiv the bananas
what was .ripenin’ on the strings. Nose didn’t
find the bob, sir.
“ Next day a lot of elderly Jews walked in an’
complained about a shillin’ what was lyin’ in our
cellar. One Jew, sir, he wuz old as a sand hill,
said it wuz criminal tew allow cellars tew swallow
up people’s money. Me dad hescorted ’em intew
the cellar, an’ he said the dawg would bite the
first man what lifted his hand tew a banana.
Dad said that since the Israelites had taken
possession of our cellar someone had taken nine
bites out of the family cheese what was in the
far corner—we kept it there tew cool so’s it
wouldn’t start fightin’ the poultry in the ’ot
weather.
“Well, shy they stayed till arter midnight
lookin’ for the bob. They came up perspirin’ an’
wiv bananas in his vice, thanked dad for lettin’
them look for the shillin’. He said that nothin’
but a thorough an’ systematic search would un-
earth the shillin’. He arst the other Jews not
tew give up ’ope.
Me dad greased the cellar steps wiv pigs’ lard
next day, but the Poleys got tired of chasin’our
foundations, an’ dad soon forgot about ’em, an’
kept tew his shippin’ trade; sold fruit to the
berman an Dane blokes what has salt in their
vices. It’s either fruit or beer wiv ’em arter a long
vige. I’ve seen a Russian sailor eat a case of
oranges, sir ; he said the sea and the salt food had
rotted his heart: he ate the case of oranges, an’
next (lay he ate the skins.
. “ Ten years arter a young .Tew gen’leman came
intew our shop an’ spoke to dad. He took a
parchment out of his pocket an’ read it. He said
Ins name wus David Sloski an’ he had come from
Poland to Australia tew inherit the house an’
chattels of Ikey Sloski. He told dad that there
wus mention in the will of a shillin’ what had been
lost in our cellar 10 years before. Then in a stern
vice he arst dad if he wud ler him go intew our
cellar an’ look for it.
“Me dad went the color of a biled sausage. He
started tew babble a bit, but the young Jew
gen’leman wus so cool an’ nice, sir, that even nmv-
ver wus touched. Dad opened the till, an’ wiv a
tremblin’ hand put a bob on the counter. ‘ Don’t
start lookin’ in the cellar arter all these years,’ ho
sez, almost crying. ‘ ’Ere’s the shillin’. Take it
away.’ Then dad gave him a couple of rabbits
an’ some parsley trimmin’s. Mother arst him to
call again an’ spend the evenin’. When he wus
going down the steps—l wus hupstairs—l emptied
a sack o’ pertaters over him ter stop him coinin’
back for the hinterest.”

After the Match.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE Pump team has had a win ; a narrow
escape from defeat at the hands of the
Dingo Flat agriculturists. Both teams
know as much about football as they do of
astronomy, and the umpire seems to know a little
less ; but it was a gallant melee, a medley of legs
and arms, a rolling ball of humanity with the
undermost now uppermost, and again beneath,
and this ball (with the football somewhere inside
it) happened to roll through the Dingo Flat goal
six times.
It is a spectacle for gods and men to witness the
scene at the final bell-ringing. Women drop
their infants to yell more effective tribute to the
victors. Ancient farmers rush to shake hands
with all and sundry. The blood-and-mud-
spattered plough-tailers file lamely off—each with
his own particular bruise engraved somewhere on
his exposed nakedness—a scar that he may show
to his grandchildren and lie bravely about.
At six o’clock players and sympathisers arc at
the pub., players still in their football togs. They
haven’t had time to change, so great has been the
rush of “shouts.” There is a din as of Hell let
loose in the bar. Everyone is talking to everyone
else and flattering himself that he’s making an im-
pression.
“The best man to-day was Riley. I say it.
Thev couldn’t catch him. He’s a oner ! ”
“ I run into that big bloke twice. I didn’t give
him nothin’ —oh, no !”
“ Did ye see how I got through them six on that
far wing?”
“Shake hands, lad; ye played great. I’ll bet
twenty quid to one that we can lick ’em every
time.”
“Fill ’em up again, Mrs. Publichouse. And
from the bar parlor comes the tinkle of a distressed
piano, and arises a chorus punctuated with hiccups.
Each individual sings on his own, and there is the
drawl of semi-drunkenness in each voice.
“ Mick Murphy’s a great player. Sure he tuk
the ball fully twinty yards, and niver dropped it
wance.”
“ That was a goal. I wuz standin’ right beside
the post, but that infernal sneak never guv it.”
Chorus again. Undertone of strained conver-
sation in the bar :
“Yer a swine, that’s what y’are. Mick’s a
better man than you.”
“ Yer a liar ! ”
“ Take that.”
Then a thump; and so many drunks get in to
see the fight that the combatants can’t find each
other.
“I’ll back Tom to beat him—for a hundred
crimson quid.”
“ Yer a good pal; ye stuck to me well to-day.”
“ D n you ! that’s my beer.”
Another abortive attempt at a fight.
Travellers passing through on Sunday morning
often wonder what special brand of football lunatic
infests this part. A weary-eyed, scarred line of
half-dressed youths adorn the long form on the
pub. verandah, and wait thirstily for the return
of a “ financial ” supporter.

“Drifter” : The desire to show off before
the best girl often flounders a man into the soup.
He was rowing grandly past Cockatoo Island. A
floating buoy in mid-stream aroused the girl’s
interest, and she asked questions. He was sure it
would support a man’s weight without sinking an
inch. The girl had her doubts, and dared him to
try. He rowed over, stepped triumphantly on
the iron deck, and struck an attitude like Captain
Cook gazing across the battlefield of Woolloomoo-
loo. Then a bright inspiration struck the girl,
and she pushed the boat off and laughed merrily.
The man also laughed—an uneasy, mirthless
guffaw ; then sat down on the iron ring. Soon the
girl tired of the joke, and picked up the sculls to
return ; but the breeze had freshened, and after
ten minutes’ agonised struggling she caught a
crab, lost one of the sculls, and then wept help-
lessly into a pair of cheap kid gloves. The alarmed
man stood up, .and frantically roared advice, but
the boat danced jauntily away. The situation
wasn’t improved by laughter from passing ferry
boats. Finally, three brown-faced kids, in a
dingy, went to the rescue, and the tempest-tossed
lovers were again united. Then I (it’s no use say-
ing “he” any longer)rnved like Cerberus with a
tin tied to his tail, to'get out of sight of the grin-
ning apes that had sailed up to watch the fun.
“Wilt”: The average Cockney fireman
on deep-sea steamers has about as much respect
for his mates’ feelings as he has for the Hereafter.
Was on a big liner at Wellington (M.L.) wharf,
when half -a-dozen stokers, all fairly oozing beer,
came aboard with letters which had just arrived
by the English mail. Leader of the party had
news to break to a pal below, and he shouted it
through a grating : “ Si, Jim, we got some letters
from the Old Dart. There’s one for you. ' We’ve


A Blood-Purifier
Impure Blood. Abscesses. Now Strong and Robust.

Mrs. Annie
Snook, of Auck-
land, New Zealand,
sends us her photo-
graph, and says:
“I was a strong,
healthy woman
until about five
years ago. While
living in England,
on recovering from
an attack of the
measles, I took a
chill, had a relapse,
and came very near
dying. My blood
was left in a very
bad state. Ab-
scesses farmed on
my body. I was
confined to my bed
two-thirds of the
time, and at times
unable to movA
For two years I
fai led to obtain any
relief, and was advised to come to New Zealand. On arriving liere I con-
tinued about the same, trying many remedies without any relief. About a
year ago I thought I would try Ayer’s Sarsaparilla. Very soon the abscesses
began to heal, and my general health improved. I followed up the treatment,
until now lam as strong and robust as ever. I cannot too strongly recommend
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla as a blood-purifier and tonic.”
Tou will notice it was “Ayer’s ” Sarsaparilla that made this splendid cur©
for Mrs. Snook. There are many other Sarsaparillas on the market, but
there is only one “Ayer’s” Sarsaparilla. It is the old, original, genuine
Sarsaparilla. The Sarsaparilla that has been tested and tried for over sixty
years:' Do not run the risk of trying some other kind.
