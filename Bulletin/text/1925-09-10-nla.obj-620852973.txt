Psycho-analysing Binghi
That the folklore, religions and compli-
cated rituals of the gentle creature with the
wistful eyes w 7 ho drifts-around country town-
ships and sits about in mission compounds
are the more or less uncensored revelations
of his inward soul is the hypothesis of Geza
Itdlieim, Ph.D. Ildheim is a young Hun-
garian who, by availing himself of the re-
searches of Basedow, Spencer and Gillen and
others, has been able to put. Binglii on the
operating-table in Budapest. The result, of
his investigations is contained in Australian
Totemism ( Allen and Ult win 1, a stately
tome that is not a translation but is written
in the author’s own extraordinarily lucid
English. '
Ilis tentative diagnosis is founded on the
hypothesis of the Primeval Horde. Wild-
beast man struggling upwards based his
polity on the supremacy of the Old Man.
Stalking across the pre-diluvian strata the
Old Man retained the ownership of his
harem of mothers, wives, sisters and daugh-
ters only/so long as by strength and cunning
he could hold it. Annually at the rutting
season—there are still tribes with vestiges
that show man once had a rutting season —
the young men fought the Old Alan for the
right to satisfy that urge which is in every
living thing. Annually they were beaten
back, until a day came when the Old Man’s
hand had lost its skill and vigor and he sank
snarling under a fusillade of stones. Stones
were the primeval weapon, and under a huge
boulder, which is the archetype of cenotaphs
and religious effigies, they pinned what was
left of him after they had dined, so that his
vengeful spirit should not rise and recover
the rights that had been taken from it. Fol-
lowed a period of wild debauchery—the first
father of mourning rites —and the new hordes
set out under new Old Men to struggle with
the animal world for survival.
Countless orgies Of father-murder followed
by incest left their mark indelibly on the
minds of Binghi’s ancestors before, they dis-
carded parricide for milder institutions. The
savage conflict was replaced by annual cele-
brations; and the truth about the matter
was relegated to the discreet card-indexes of
the Unconscious. Binghi’s beliefs and cus-,
toms,. however, according to the Freudian
investigator, still artlessly record his early
histoi-y. Thus the churinga, the stone heir-
loom lie piously cherishes, is the symbol of
the slaughtered Old Alan’s reproductive
powers. No woman can become fertile with-
out its interposition, which, interpreted
psychologically, means that the uneasy con-
sciences of the parricides have symbolically
restored to' the murdered parent the. right he
once owned in actuality of being the father
of all the offspring of the tribe. The painful
operation performed on the youVig men at
their initiation into manhood is in expiation
of that ancient,, oft-repeated crime; and the
first conception of the life hereafter, the hole
in the ground in which a dead man is placed,
is psychologically the womb to which the
sub-conscious minds of children long to
return.
One of the proofs advanced in support of
the psycho-analyst’s exciting theory is that,
all! lough Binglii stoutly asserts that the
tribal doctor, so to speak, brings the small
binghis in his bag, his myths and customs,
with a wealth of phallic symbolism, betray
that he is subconsciously aware of the actual
facts. The alleged ignorance is. psycholo-
gically speaking, an example of repressed
knowledge.
Although the author submits his guesses
with due humility there is little doubt that
the psychological method of studying primi-
tive origins is likely to supplement the old
ethnological inquiries with valuable results.
Thus the fact that the knowledge of certain
aspects of sexual life appears as a repression
in one part-of Australia and reappears as
a frank confession, in some of the neighbor-
ing islands may help to date the' era when
Binglii entered his present home. It may
help to dispel tin' difficulties of Perry and
Grafton Smith, who. to explain the appear-
ance of similar customs at isolated points,
were forced to the conclusion that vpst world
movements had taken place. The libido of
every person, from the civilised baby to the
moron and the savage, expresses itself in
much the same choice of symbols, and the
snake and the bat appear in every country
as the emblems of procreative function.
Since Freud and his fellow-disturbers of
the peace opened the cupboard of civilised
man’s psyche, disclosing the skeleton of the
subconscious mind grinning indecorously in-
side, civilised man has felt Uncomfortable
about it. Eagerness to know exactly how
the extraordinary lodger got there has' been
displayed on all sides, and it has even been
asserted that the solution of the riddle is
civilisation’s one hope of salvation. Hence
Binglii. who flaunts his skeleton openly be-
fore him, assumes a new importance.
M. G. S.
Industrial Woman, White and Black
It is always edifying to hear of Austra-
lians who have “made good” away from
home. Such a one is Miss Alice Henry.
Twenty years ago, a journalist of the front
rank, she left Melbourne at the, call of
Adventure, and after a look around settled-
in the United States. Service rather than
success making a resistless appeal, she idea
tifiod herself with the National Women’s
Trade Union League. In due course she
edited its journal. Life and Labor, and took
on the secretaryship of its Educational De-
partment. To-day she is the director of the
training school for women workers in indus-
try. Another Australian, Miles Franklin,
whose “My Brilliant Career” is an unfor-
gettable contribution to our literature,
was one. of Miss Henry’s distinguished asso-
ciates in the busy life of a league that touched
extensive duties, national and international.
Some years ago Miss Henry issued a scholarly
and informing book entitled “The Trade Union
Woman” ; now we have from her spiritual
pen Women and the Labor Movement (Doran
Co.. New York), a monograph which has
followed- her to. Australia, for in this eoun-
try she now is, enjoying a rest before return-
ing to work. This book is a simply and
humanly-written record of the steady growth
of organisation among women in. all branches
of industry in the United States.
The distinctly American portions of this
latest book comprise an instructive review in
two chapters of women in modern trade
unions, and a thoughtful survey of “The
Negro Woman.” In the first-named section
we learn that the affiliation with Labor of
schapl-teach,ers has pi-oceeded much farther
than in our own land. Miss Henry claims
that the unionising of teachers has ad-
vanced tutorial ideals and brought into being
modern improvements. It is particularly
striking to find that to this step is trace-
able “the saving of the cultural part of the
school programme from being swamped by
the advocates of vocational training,” for in
Australia Labor’s yapping is largely for more
and better technical education and to hell
with culture! Miss Henry is a member of
the American Federation of Teachers and
knows tier profession through and through.
She, insists that improvements in the work-
ing conditions of teachers improves the edu-
cational work done for and by the children.
She claims—and this is a typical sentence
that will serve to show the simplicity and
dii’ectness of her style—that “the union move-
ment luts strengthened in teachers the sense
of our public educational system as a social
function of the community, rather than as a
group of jobs sustained by a budget, and
dii-ected by academic captains.” The activi-
ties of another union of brain-workers, the
Actors' Association, reveals liow a pictu-
resque and dramatic strike for the right to
affiliate with Labor involved every actor of
prominence on one side or the other.
A White Australian turns avidly to the
section on the negro woman. To her, as to
the white, the war brought opportunity. “It
'meant an opened door into the world of
industrial service.” Entering occupations
hitherto closed to her, she is in some in-
stances “still holding her own.” She de-
veloped what Miss Henry absorbingly treats
as “the factory sense,” and acquired a “foot-
ing, however slippery, that will make her
an increasingly important factor in Ameri-
can industry in the future.” In 1920, in
150 plants distributed over nine States,
negro women were more than 40 per cent, of
the women employed. The tobacco, metal
and textile industries , engulfed them. In
one large steel plant a negro girl was the
best worker. In a meat-packing plaift, tak-
ing the place of men in cutting hog-ears, the
women earned men’s wages, and did the work
better —“much better.” Seasonal occupa-
tions, however, are their common employ-
ment. As for the color line, it is there, and
it isn’t there. Managers are experimenting
with non-separation and claim successes. On
the other hand, though the negro woman
learns shorthand, typing and book-keeping in
the Chicago schools, it is Chicago—with the
third largest negro population in the coun-
try—that offers the colored woman the least
opportunity to advance. “Most of them are
driven to take employment as domestics or
.huntresses.” In the main, Miss Henry,
offering suggestions towards solutions, finds
that the discrimination in wages against
white women applies in a greater degree,
to colored women. “As regards her permanent
industrial status, the colored woman can rise
only in the degree her race rises. Unless justice
be done to the colored man and woman alike,
they will both help to drag down the stand-
ards of the white workers to the level of
their own. and may live to be registered as
strike-breakers in many a future struggle."
The chapter on war is in a way terrible,
for in munition plants in ten States there was
at first often the gravest neglect of common
cleanliness, and the conditions created of con-
gestion and confusion were in cases inde-
scribable. The Assistant-Professor of Indus-
trial diseases at Harvard, Dr. Alice Hamil-
ton, is quoted: “There is no way of know-
ing,” she says, “liow much illness and death
resulted from this mad rush to get out ex-
plosives in a shorter time than they could
properly be made.” In the making of gas-
masks in one factory 8500 of 12.000 em-
ployees were women, and one gathers that
the accession of women to industry generally
was enormous, The greatest pressure was
brought to bear upon women to enter every
occupation stripped for the time of its men.
When the war ended men went on strike to en-
force the dismissal of women ! Oh the theory
of what is or isn’t woman’s vocation Miss
Henry is guarded, but she reminds us that
nearly all former theories have passed. This
much is sure: “With the fuller development
of industry, the tendency has been to draw
women into many occupations and into many
processes hitherto considered the domain of
men.” Trade unionism is woman’s refuge
and strength. To-day women are “the under-
bidders of men, over-worked, underpaid and
too often killed or wrecked in their early
womanhood before the very eyes of a society
too stupid to value aright the. life, of a young
girl or a young mother.” Shameful to add,
not the least sinner in this respect is the
male trade-unionist! *
In a chapter on the minimum wage Miss
Henry outlines Australia’s arbitration and
Victoria’s Wages Board, in the last connec-
tion, one is glad to note, paying generous
tribute to the imaginative foresight and dis-
interestedness of Alexander Peacock. One
is struck, amid all the similarities, with the
stupendous difference in one particular be-
tween America and Australia in the domain
the gifted authoress explores. No’book like
Miss Henry’s could be written of our own
country without its pages being studded with
references to political Labor; yet it can be
Written of America without one such refer-
ence !

DAVID JONES’
for Service —SYDNEY
last 15 years, and the third written in Rui °i t
nearly 20 years ago. Though the harvest 1
that rather long period is meagre in quantitj,
it is distinctly of happy omen that some o
the things written latest are in every 10
most attractive. This is not to say that the
earlier work conspicuously fails. On the con-
trary. there are few pieces included m the
collection which lack charm, and from his
to last the thought is good and the
generally worthy of it. The opening poem,
"The Dance,” from a larger work either un-
finished or imaginary called “The Man \\ ho
Went to Fairyland,” is strong and pleasing.
In it the author uses a free and delicate
metre without strain or artifice. His choice
of words is of the simplest, and he never tails
to present the perfect mind-picture which ae
sees. Stronger than this, in a slower move-
ment, is “The Unhappy Satyr,” perhaps the
best poem in the collection. There is good
reason to object to many of the rhymes in
this piece. “Stone” is not a rhyme tor
"upon,” nor “gone” for “won,”’ while the
attempt to rhyme “blood” with “wood and
"satyrhood,” though sanctioned by old cus-
tom, leaves the ear unsatisfied. It is a tri-
bute to the quality of the verse that these
blemishes do not destroy the lines, but a
stricter rhyming would certainly have lifted
them to a higher place. Very pleasing also
is “The Enchanted Orchard,” written with-
out rhyme in verse that suggests Greek metre,
but does not seem to aim at exact imitation.
Take two stanzas :
There drugged and drowsy bees tell sleepy stories
Of the mysterious stirrings of far blossoms
On blue and golden noons, and the earth, turned over
By the steel of the plough, strains up till the air
trembles
With its spirit escaping.
There, in the middle of September
The breeze that blows among the blossoming acres,
Blossoming acres, 0 besieging acres,
Rich with bewildering magic of strange rumors,
Stabs with its keenness.
’Phis, from “Australia —iu Germany,” belongs
to the earlier work: —
Under the pines I lie
Where purple shadows creep
Through misty gloom to spy
About me as I sleep;
But O, I am far withdrawn
To a land of southern dawn,
Where the sun swings high in the sky
And soft winds laden deep
With blossom and odor, lie
On a plainland silver-grey
"With grasses mellow and sweet,
Till level and shining steep,
Rich with the splendor of day,
Call to my swift-shod feet.
The lines quoted from the two pieces repre-
sent about the average of two-thirds of the
book. There arc treasures of line and phrase
not too sparsely sprinkled through the whole.
The Frequent Lover : Bis Verses is by
Harold Mercer (Robertson and Mullens, Mel-
bourne). When some singer of the time of
James I. finally dropped his pen he left his
literary waistcoat to Harold Mercer. It was
not his full coat that he bequeathed, for Mer-
cer has a singing coat of his own; but the
smaller garment carried with it an old-time
flutter of mirth and a peculiar turn of
thought. Not that this writer uses anti-
quated language. He is, on the contrary,
quite modern, writing in every-day English,
sometimes in every-street Australian; it is
his mode of thought and expression that links
with the past rather than the "Word and
phrase. In this little book—it is a very
little one of only 32 pages—there is much to
please and a good deal to smile over; but
those who have for years read Mercer’s work
may be a little disappointed at flic selection.
It wall seem to most that this “{Frequent
Lover” has frequently loved in better verses
than some that have been chosen; but even
with this admission there is not mi»ch in the
book that can be said to miss. Ojne of the
most characteristic pieces is called “(Excuse” :
I know not -why you should complain
Of Marjorie or Ivate;
I may have loved, but did not wed
Those girls at any rate.
There is >no reason you should sigh
Or vow that I’m untrue.
It only means I did not try
A prentice love on you.
How could I an inconstant be
To you before I knew
How lovelier than all others were
The attributes of youl
Believe me, dear, that at the worst
My perfidy is such
I could not love you, dearest, more
Loved 1 not others much.
And this from a set of verses of nearly the
same name: —
The moon, the magic night
With beauty bound you;
I put, thralled by the sight,
My arm around you.
Then (for the fault we shared,
The blame is owed you)
You asked me how I dared
And I just showed you!
“Hamer” —the pen-name by which Mercer is
best known—has Avon hosts of friends by his
clever handling of such themes. His muse
flutters rather than soars, but the lady is
always whimsically sedate in her mirth. It
is good to have these 28 short pieces put on
record, but a larger and more representative
volume would be welcome.
D. M. W.
Cinderella and Mr. Cabell
.Tames Branch Cabell came to his own with
the publication of “Jurgen”—came to it not
per saltern, but with the slow recognition of
a new force in letters that baffled classifica-
tion. Fantastic, audacious, ironical and
witty, he used symbol, allegory, satire and
philosophy alike —with such deft touches that
the reader felt himself being played upon as
a mere instrument in the hands of a master.
One felt it to be dangerous to agree with
Cabell on any point lest a few pages later
on he should constrain one to an equally full
agreement with the opposite. Under the
magic of his pen men found themselves
chuckling at the humor plucked out of their
most cherished and even sacred conventions.
For it is in the unconventional that Cabell
moves, recognising no limits to the exercise
of his art. He touches Rabelais at one point
and the high gods at the other.
In his latest book, Beyond Life (John.
Lane), he presents to the reader through
one John Cliarteris, author, book-lover and
collector, a sort of kaleidoscopic view of what
Cliarteris describes as “the economist theory
as to literature and human affairs in gen-
oral.” In this fantastic presentation we see
flash up, form, dissolve and re-form a medley
of thought, pungent satire and rich color
that fascinates and holds one —suggestive
and yet not convincing. Obviously, then, it
is a case for selection.
Romance, in the creed of John Charteris.
is a world-shaping and world-controlling
principle, and he dubs it “the demi-urge” a
somewhat pretentious title. It controls the
minds of men, and by creating force-produc-
ing illusions furthers the world’s betterment
with the forces so brought into being.
Each generation of naturally inert mortals
is thus propelled towards a higher sphere
and manner of living. With the advent of
the novel it became possible to acceptably
present in literature men “as they ought
to be.” The novel having succeeded the
drama, it was no longer necessary for the
artist to represent human beings with even
partial veracity, “and this new style of writ-
ing at once became emblematic.” Novelists
evolved their pleasing symbols. “The sym-
bols have often varied ; but there lias rarely
been any ill-advised attempt to depict life as
it seems in the living of it. or to crystallise
the vague notions and feeble sensations with
which human beings actually muddle through
to an epitaph; if only because all sensible
persons, obscurely aware that this routine is
far from what it ought to be, have always
preferred to deny its existence.” This evasion
of veracity is the true mission of the novel.
Readers do not want to see either life or
themselves presented in their true propor-
tions. According to the gospel by John
Charteris, its essential duty is to uplift man
by presenting him with pictures of the world
and Mr. Jones in heroic proportions. Thus
may he be stimulated to higher things, on a
bigger scale. “You will observe,” insists
Charteris. “that the beginnings of fiction
everywhere, among all races, take with curi-
ous unanimity the same form. It is always
the history of the unlooked-for achievements
and the ultimate very public triumph of the
ill-used youngest son.” Everywhere it was
to the ' despised weakling that romance
accorded the final triumph. Such stimulus
of romance doubtless had Simon Tappertit.
Then came a stroke of genius that improved
the tale by adding the handicap of sex-weak-
ness. “Cinderella (whom romance begot and
deified as Psyche) straightway led captive
every dreamer’s hitherto unvoiced desire.
This is the world’s most beloved story
Any author anywhere can gain men’s love
by remodelling (not too drastically) the his-
tory of Cinderella and the miracle is that
the most sophisticated continue to thrill at
each re-telling of the hackneyed story, with
the instant response of fiddlestrings, to an
interpretation of life which one is tempted
to describe as fiddlesticks.” Yet, he goes on
to point out. this public triumph of the
downtrodden is of necessity a tenet accept-
able to a world of ineffectual inhabitants,
each one “a monarch of dreams incarcerated
in a prison of flesh.” Humanity from an
early period seems to have wrenched com-
fort from prefiguring man as the hero of
the cosmic romance. “Inevitably as the pea-
fowl came to listen with condescension to
the nightingale, and the tortoise to deplore
the slapdash ways of his contemporaries,
man probably began very early to regale
himself with flattering narratives as to his
nature and destiny And so to-day, as
always, we delight to hear about invincible
men and women of unearthly loveliness —
corrected and considerably augmented ver-
sions of our family circle —performing feats
inimitably beyond our modest powers.” Now
all this according to Charteris serves utili-
tarian ends, for traits held up as desirable
to the average person will eventually lead
to his pretending to possess them. “So it
is that man’s vanity and hypocrisy and lack
of clear thinking are in a fair way to prove
in the outcome his salvation. .. . For man
alone of animals plays the ape of his dreams.”
One is tempted to go on extracting from this
whimsical and ironically Inimorous book
more and still more passages. In the end we
really come to be convinced, or almost so,
that John Charteris is right, and that we
want in our novels not the exactitude of the
literary photographer but the dream-pictures
of the artist —impossibly brilliant sunlight,
impossible greenness of verdures, impossible
virtues of women, and equally impossible
heroisms in man. Perhaps, after all, the real-
ist does not exist, for Charteris suggests that
no man knows what is the real; but we do
know that we dearly love to be tricked and
tickled by the things we are not.
T. B. C.
The Savage
A recent account of present-day life in
Moscow told how “the pavement outside the
biggest State shop is lined with men and
women, many of them obviously belonging
to the intelligent classes, hawking scents,
copies of Artzybasheff’s ‘Sanin,’ guides to
Moscow, and cheap toys.” Now, Mikhail
Artzybasheff is not a pro-Soviet writer, and
“Sanin” sells well to-day probably for the
reason that it sold well before the war: it
is full of seduction scenes painted in full
detail. Sanin, the hero, is the strong, “beyond
good and evil” type of man, who carries out
Nietzsche’s advice of taking a whip when he
goes to the woman who has won his fancy.
A somewhat similar type of man is the hero
of this writer’s other novel, “Breaking
Point.” But “Breaking Point” is a far finer
novel than “Sanin,” and its purpose is much
more obvious.
The hero of “Breaking Point,” like Sanin,
approximates to the German idea of the
superman. He is strong-willed, brave, cruel,
handsome, intellectual. He takes whatever
he desires, and is a man devoid of any “good
conscience.” Accordfng to the German idea
(which is only a sort of materialised Nietz-
schean idea) he should be a happy man. But
he is not. He is a man who says to himself,
“I smother my desires and I am unhappy,
and I give free rein to my desires and I am
unhappy still.” He takes from life what is
in a strong man’s power to take, but he
always knows that there remains something
beyond his reach. This knowledge of some-
thing higher and better, conflicting with the
animal that is in him and is so much of
him, gives the name to the novel. Breaking
point is near. Artzybasheff endeavors to
show the ideal Russian developing from the
peasant through the intellectual man—that
is. directly from the soil of Russia. But he
does not show or even suggest how far off
is the advent of that ideal man. In a more
recent novel lie does.
Neither “Sanin” nor “Breaking Point” are
political novels; it is only when one has read
through ten chapters of powerfully-described
scenes of bestiality and violence that one be-
gins to perceive that “The Savage” has any
purpose at all. “Savage” is the name of the
family with which the story is concerned.
What a family it is ! The old mother looks
to the ikon-lamps and hoards money, and
from dawn to sunset nags at her sons and the
servants. The eldest son is a “torpid, narrow-
minded usurer, an egoist and a perverse
tyrant, a man of dark passions and danger-
ous frenzies.” The second son, Zakhar, is
“a jolly devil-may-care, to whom life, either
his own or that of a fellow creature, is not
worth a groat. He is a spendthrift, a drunk-
ard. and a debauchee.” The third son is an
idiot who spends most of his time making-
lewd signs to the young women working in
his brother’s fields.
The day comes when the eldest son, Klim
Ivanovitch, marines Glafira. This is a pic-
ture of Glafira: “The young wife is beautiful
with that erude, sensual Russian beauty,
that wild beauty of which we hear so much
in our songs: ‘her hair reaches down to her
heels, she Avalks like a peacock, her neck is
like a swan’s and her soul’ —well, her soul
is that of a healthy brood-mare.” She falls
in love with Zakhar, is discovered, and almost
beaten to death by her husband. Her hus-
band is shot by the idiot third son, and
Zakhar is charged with the murder.
The twelfth chapter of the book is the
speech of the counsel for the prosecution.
For a long time he does not mention Zakhar.
His talk is all of Russia. “We have to try
a terrible tragic crime, a crime which, alas!
is an almost daily event in Russian life. Our
people are barbarous and ignorant. Russian
literature has idealised them, calling them a
people of God-fearers and God-seekers ! But
if the second title is justified in so far as a
primitive human being seeks after God, the
first is utterly baseless either in the present
or the past of the Russian nation. The. whole
of Russian history is one long chronicle of
senseless rebellions, cruel conquests, blood-
thirsty princes and fanatical monks. The
Russian people are not even religious, they
arc only superstitious.... We are still in the
Prehistoric Ages, and the traces of our
Asiatic origin have not yet faded from our
faces and our 50u15.... A lack measure
and purpose in everything. With us an ideal
becomes a dogma....a political struggle de-
generates into Red Terrorism and merciless
dictatorship Our literature is either a
blatant prophecy hurled in the face of the
world, or a shameless baring of souls and
self-flagellation We have intelligence
and the capacity for great deeds and
great truth —but we are, above all. sav-
ages, and, like savages, we lack all self-
control.” Ultimately he comes to Zakhar.
“You will ask me: Has all this anything to
do with the case we are here to try? It has.
Before you in the dock stands a typical son
of vast, wild Russia, a tradesman’s son, a
happy-go-luekv fellow like the youths in our
legends. They not only cock their hats but
put their brains at an angle. Let them throw
back their shoulders and swing their arms,
and they arc all passion and bluster. The
whole country swarms with them. They pro-
vide our literature, our political parties, and
they are only waiting for the opportunity to
show their prowess and their license to the
whole world. And they will show them!
The world will quake and civilised Europe
will shiver with terror: Zakhar Dikoy is
coming! How symbolic this common Russian
name is! Dikoy! The savage! Indeed we
are savages. Only in Russia do such types
and such families exist. I am going to teil
vou the story of this family.” It is
the story of Russia. He arraigns the
whole of pre-war Russia from the aristo-
cracy to the peasantry. It is a terrible
arraignment.
Zakhar is condemned by the jury of his
own townspeople, who know that he is inno-
cent of the murder. When the counsel for
the defence, a brilliant intellectual man, asks
later why the prisoner was declared guilty,
the foreman cannot explain. “He is one of
us. You cannot understand us. We can
understand you.” So the dog understands his
articulate master, whilst the master cannot
understand the inarticulate dog.
Here is a book written by a Russian about
Russian life and Russian people. Possibly
if some of those people who aspire to place
Australia and Australians on a level with
Russia and Russian people could read it. the
forceful, passionate sincerity of it might set
them thinking.
ALAN D. MICKLE.
A Satchel of Books
A Cavalier of Navarre, by Charles B. Stilson
(Howard Watt). A tale of pikemen, musketeers,
beauteous dames, valorous lovers and inconceivably
wicked villains. The movement is brisk, the fighting
scarlet, the chivalry without reproach.
Primary Gymnastics , by Niels Bukh • (Methuen).
The author is a teacher in the Danish gymnastic
and rifle clubs, and offers his work as a basis for a
rational scheme of physical development to counteract
the effects of a sedentary life. liis course is made
applicable to women as well as men. A practical
little work, which makes a useful text-book for all
interested in physical culture.
The Roman Way, by G. V. McFadden (John Lane).
The action of the novel is cast in the latter part
of the eighteenth century, a period marked not only
by the great revolutionary movement across the
Channel, but by social and political unrest in Eng-
land. We get the customary setting, the ancient and
neglected manor house, the stranger and the child,
Ihe mysterious murder —all the familiar melodramatic
puppets set to a new dance. But Miss McFadden’s
measure is always sprightly.
A Prairie Parson, by R. W. Campbell (W. and R.
Chambers). A throw-back to a type of novel that
was some years ago in vogue. Originally the writer
(the book adopts an autobiographical form) was an
officer in the Scots Greys. He left the Army, for the
Church, ministered in his office for a term in Scot-
land and then made his way to Canada. His life
there as a prairie parson furnishes interesting material
on the social conditions attending settlement in the
Dominion and contains many bright sketches of
character.
J. C. Andersen concludes an article on “Mudie
and his Felonry” (B. 20/8/’2o) by asking if any
other copies with tile printed notes referred to are
known to exist. Mr. H. , Wright, of the Mitchell
Library, tells the Red Page that lie knows of two
other copies of the book containing the marginal
notes that refer to Blaxland. ' One is in the possession
of the Public Library of N.S.W,; the other is owned
by J. A. Ferguson, a Sydney collector. Such copies
are scarce. It is obvious that the notes were printed
and pasted in a few copies at the order of a Blaxland.

—“the best, absolutely,
THE efficiency of the STEWART in absorbing road shocks is surprising,
and Motorists with experience of earlier snubbing devices invariably
remark on it, realising quickly that it is giving them greater riding
comfort than they had ever known hitherto. This ability to absorb shocks
to an unusual degree is the result of the principle on which the Stewart
operates. This principle does not embody the use of a coiled strap which,
by tightening upon itself, creates friction—as in other absorbers. This
tightening results in the strap coils sticking, so that a period of time must
elapse after each shock takes place to permit of the strap releasing itself.
For this reason other shocks occur without shock-absorbing action taking place.
In the STEWART the friction necessary to absorb the shocks is supplied by
two discs placed against the sides of the steel drum enclosing the recoil
spring. These discs are specially treated, and they serve the purpose of friction
clutches. The friction resulting offers the maximum resistance to the rebound
of the car springs; it is greater by far than the friction supplied by the coiling
of a strap upon itself, and there is nothing whatsoever to hinder the working
of the friction discs; hence the ability of the Stewart to absorb every shock
—and it does! You adjust the friction to suit yourself—with the little red
wrench provided.

Yet the cinema, aeroplane and radio have made all these
things possible!
Until recently it was considered impossible to build a
motor car that would combine the advantages of an
open and an enclos6d car. Yet Studebaker has done just
that in its new Duplex body!
In 30 seconds, the Duplex can be converted from an
open to an enclosed car, or vice versa, without getting
out of the car or stopping. Weighs no more; costs no
more than a strictly open car.
See the new Duplex body —an exclusive Studebaker
feature—before you buy. See the host of refinements
on the new Studebaker models—the light control on the
steering wheel, the new type emergency brake operated
from the dash, the grouping of all instruments under
glass, the genuine balloon tyres with specially designed
steering gear, springs and mudguards.
See these and many additional features of the New
Studebaker models!

lam in love with Love, and he is strong—
So strong that he is terrible —and I,
Who, laughing, leapt to meet him and defy
His force to rival mine, admit my wrong.
I cannot bear a tyranny so long,
So merciless. His ivings. are dark and high,
Shutting from all the brilliance of the sky,
The hesitating first notes of my song.
I cannot feel, I cannot laugh nor sing;
The love which casts out fear is gone from
me.
The sombre, mighty shadow from above
Lies black across my path. A whispering
Deep in my heart asks if it may not be
That fear grow mad at length and cast out
Love!

A Ballad of Ins and Outs.
I know a song my soul should shout, to the
shame of the city’s din,
A song of the ins who are never out and the
outs who are never in,
A song of the ifs and shan’ts and dou’ts that
take their place in the crowd,
With the will-o’-tlie-wisps called wills and
won’ts and heads that are anguish bow’d.
We move along in a wobbly world in search
of some future bright;
Kind thoughts, like scum, through the thin
air hurled, are spent to our soul’s despite.
We greet fond hopes with a sceptic’s grin ;
and we do not care a curse
If the ins are out or the outs are in, so I
write my vagrant verse.
Vagrant verse for the men who sink in the
pit as the moments drag—
The down-and-outers, the men who drink,
whose souls go out on the vag.
Deep in the pit of despondency, where the
soiled souls run to seed,
They do not worry for what may be or
whether the world takes heed
Of plants that spring from the germ there
sown —frail plants that will blossom
sure,
And nourish a perfume all their own that
will last while the stars endure!
But I know a song of true-blood faith that
my hr others-in-arms will shout:
“The outs who suffered are in for good, and
the ins will he never out!”

ALBATROSS.
In Vain.
There lived a kins in India long ago
Whom the gods hated, granting his desire.
So for an instant, with a heart on fire,
Beauty herself he saw, her face aglow
In blinding light against stark peaks of
snow.
He saw and perished; but his carthbound
soul
Roves seeking still from pole to desolate pole
The goddess-love that he can never know.
So, as the flaming -western sky grew dim,
Dreaming, I saw Love’s face and found it
fair.
And now I seek for ever hopelessly
Those gardens of my heart, dream-gardens
where
Against black cypress by the moon-pale sea,
Duskily bright, I saw the face of him.

The Day’s Work.
Dawn comes and with its golden wand
Wafts night and sleep away,
And gems with dew green leaf and frond,
Fair flower and graceful spray.
Half-girdling Dacre’s lowland farm
With new-born glory lit,
The Hunter River curves an arm
As though in love with it.
While birds on willow-tree and oak
Their matin music make,
At Dacre’s farm the sleeping folk
Turn over, and awake.
What is it that the farmfolk hear
As they lie thus abed?
What voices, loud and rich and clear,
Tell them the night has fled?
What is it that the magpies sing,
Their morning preening done,
As white of breast and black of wing
They greet the morning sun?
Blithe minstrels of the woodland way
By love of light thrilled through,
“Awake, awake!” they surely say,
“For there is work to do.”
With heads uplifted, breasts agleam,
They sing fron'i stump and bough:
“The churn is waiting for the cream,
The furrow for the plough.”
Together all. with satin backs,
Their mellow notes they speed:
“The tree is waiting for the axe,
The soil awaits the seed.”
Then ere the magpies’ music dies,
With eyes and hearts that irk
To meet the day, the farmfolk rise
And set about their work.
To dairy, field and barn they turn.
Brown-armed and bright of brow;
The farmer’s daughter plies the churn,
The farmer’s son the plough.
With axe and saw the farmer tall
Brings tree and sapling down;
The farmer’s wife kneads bread for all,
And bakes it rich and brown.
And thus with not a day too long
For robust heart and arm—
Much like a song, a happy song—
Work speeds at Dacre’s farm.

A “FULL AND UNEQUIVOCAL
MANDATE.”
When the last N. S. Wales Labor Govern-
ment took office in 1920, Premier John
Storey, in an effort to persuade hungry
“comrades” to be less exorbitant in their de-
mands, explained that the electors had re-
turned his party with 45 members in a
House of 90, and that he therefore had
“only half a mandate.” The present Labor
Government, meeting Parliament last month
with one more vote than Storey controlled,
and recalling his words in a very different
frame of mind, exultantly proclaimed that
it had come from the country with “a full and
unequivocal mandate.” This assertion was
made in the Governor’s Speech, and repeated,
with variations, by nearly every Ministerial
contributor to the debates on the Address-
in-Reply and George Fuller’s no-confi-
dence amendment, nor was it seriously chal-
lenged bv members of the Opposition. Yet
the hollowness of it could have been ex-
posed by reference to Under-Secretary
Hakkness’s report on the general election,
copies of which were issued to members while
the no-confidence argument was raging. That
report shows, when the figures are analysed,
that the Government with the alleged “full
and unequivocal mandate” received less than
one-half of the effective votes polled. It
shows also how stupid the Nationalists were
m going to the country without substituting
the preferential-voting system, with single
electorates, for the proportional fraud. Had
they done this, or even redistributed the lop-
sided electorates without abolishing propor-
tionausm, they would assuredly be in office
still, with or without the Progressives. But
they fatuously swallowed the assurance of
the glib Ley, Minister for Justice and pillar
of proportional representation, that if they
and the Progs, polled more votes than the
Labor party, which they did, they would in-
fallibly get more seats, which they didn’t.
* * * *
Thanks to clever Mr. Ley, the number of
effective votes sufficient to elect one member
was 4423 in Sturt, 5552 in Sydney, 6490 in
Goulburn and 7727 in Balmain, all Labor
strongholds. On the other hand it took
10,908 votes to return one member in
Nationalist Ryde, 9010 in Eastern Suburbs,
8768 in North Shore, 8320 in Western
Suburbs and 7885 in Cumberland. And
10,607 was the quota in Mr. Ley’s own elec-
torate of St. George, which was thought to
be predominantly Nationalist (it returned
three Nationalists in the last Parliament),
and very likely would have been but for
Mr. Ley and his P.R. fad and his Ne
Temere Bill. Not only were the Nationalists
expelled from office by the representatives of
a minority, but the mortification of being
under-represented has been added to the
bitterness of a self-caused defeat, as the sub-
joined figures show:—

In effect, 410,478 votes elected 40 Labor
members, an average of 8923 ; 361,508 elected
33 Nationalists, average 10,954 ; 07,498 elected
nine Progressives, average 7499 ; and 22,451
elected two Independents, average 11,225. With
18,528 fewer votes than were polled for the
Nat.-Progs., the Labor party gained four more
members. Even if the votes cast for
the two Independent members were added
to Labor’s, the party which claims the
“full and unequivocal mandate” would still
be 2155 short of the Nat.-Prog. total; and
the Independent vote throughout the State
was anti-Labor in the main. Labor ran full
tickets for Western Suburbs, North Shore,
Newcastle, Parramatta and Sturt. In
Western Suburbs the Independent was
A. G. Huie, who has never shown
any leaning towards Labor-socialism;
in North Shore it was A. D. Ivay, who
stood as a Nationalist in 1917 and was
classed as a Fullerite with a genuine griev-
ance against the party machine. But for
this feeling, Ivay, who at the very first test
shamelessly ratted on 95 p.c. of his supporters
(thereby providing another argument against
proportional representation, and another for
the recall), wouldn’t have had the ghost of a
chance in an electorate like North Shore.
Skelton, the Newcastle Independent, cer-
tainly cut into the Labor vote, but Nation-
alists patently helped him to a considerable
extent. When his surplus was distributed
(he received 10,194 first preferences, the
quota being 9602) the Nationalist Cromarty
got more of it than the three remaining
Laborites, the other two having exceeded the
quota.
* * * *
Whether first or final counts are con-
sidered, the effect is the same. An examina-
tion of first preferences shows that 381,830
were cast for the Labor-socialists (46 seats),
333,785 for the Nationalists (33 seats),
82,019 for the Progressives (9 seats) and
52,885 for Independents. In Goulburn the
Lang party polled only 12,058 out of 25,956
first preferences, but secured two of the
three seats. This achievement is attributable
partly to the asinine Nationalist assumption
that, with proportional representation in
being, a majority of seats could not be
won with a minority of votes, and partly
to the folly of a large batch of Progressives
in refusing to continue their preferences to
the Nationalists —there were actually 1520
exhausted votes. Thereby these Goulburn
farmers helped to put in a Government which
has refused to let the State police be used
for the service of Commonwealth processes
on foreign-born Communists —which has
taken up the position that any arrogant im-
ported clique that holds up the transport
of wool, wheat, dead meat, dried fruits, dairy
produce and the like is on no account to
be interfered with, being above Australian
laws. They are also to be rewarded, among
other things, with multiplied income-tax
rates, spoils to the victors in the public
service, the suspension of local-government
elections until adult suffrage is made uni-
versal, and the placing of the Railway
Department under trade-union control, none
of which matters was even hinted at before
the election by the crowd which falsely alleges
that it has a “full and unequivocal man-
date.” There is no evidence that the l.abor-
socialist or Communist party has a majority
anywhere. Such “victories” as it has gained
during the past two years have been due
to the tomfoolery of its opponents, and if
the Bkuce-Page Government makes no better
use of the electoral machinery under its
control than did the late Nationalist Minis-
tries in Westralia, South Australia and N.
S. Wales it will be the next to go. Yet the
Bkuce-Page Government, though soft-handed
and slow-moving, is Australia’s last remaining
bulwark against the surrender of its insti-
tutions to blatant mobs organised for plunder
and the seizure of power.
REFERENDUM v. BOLSHEVISM.
The idea that Australia is a democratic
country has had such long and wide accept-
ance as to have become something of an
axiom, but even that kind of article is due
tor reconsideration now and then. Investi-
gation does no harm, anyhow, and it may be
worth while inquiring whether Australia is
not really a very backward and ill-educated
member of the group of nations which are
white and use the English language, and
whether what is taken for being democratic
isn’t really being so shiftless and unfinished
that the machine of government threatens
a deadlock. The question might even be
raised whether this country isn’t a rare ex-
ample of arrested development, caused in
great measure by being the spoiled child of
an imaginary rich father, which father is
really the. uncle who lends a great deal too
much money. Among the local institutions
is a Federal Lower House which is absolutely
representative of the people, and as democratic
as it can be, but which has insufficient power
and makes insufficient use of what it has.
Then there is a Senate which is as demo-
cratic as is possible while preserving the
Federal principle of the equal representation
of States, but would be more democratic if
Queensland and N. S. Wales were subdivided.
There are State Upper Houses chosen on a
property franchise, and one stuffed with
nominees, many of them of a very inferior
brand; and there is the memory of another
nominee Upper House which was abolished
despite the definitely expressed will of the
people to the contrary. These Upper State
institutions are no more democratic than
the British House of Lords in its reformed
condition. The State Lower Houses are
popular assemblies within certain limitations.
It is possible (because it happens) for 1391
constituents to return three members and
for 35,630 constituents in the same State
to return only the same number; and it is
possible for this sort of discrepancy to be so
persistent that a minority party in the
country can, by luck with the small, decayed
districts, secure and long retain a decisive
majority in Parliament. The discrepancy
habit has drifted so far that hardly one State
Lower House is really representative of
the community it stands for. Another possi-
bility is for a defeated applicant for the
successful party’s nomination to declare that
of the successful applicants every one
secured his nomination by fraud, and that
not one was the people’s genuine choice. In
addition to all else, the Lower House of
N. S. Wales has become to some extent a
nominee body, which is a return to the Dark
Political Ages of 60 years ago. Further,
the Federal Parliament is too much influ-
enced by the Governments of the big States,
as a weak mediaeval king was influenced by
overgrown barons; and some of the State
Governments can’t call their souls their own
because of Labor organisations. And some
Labor organisations are so bossed by im-
ported insurrectionists with instructions from,
Moscow that they have little soul left.
* -*■»*
A nation which has made such an elabo-
rate and widespread mess of its self-governing
institutions is either short of energy, or of
the higher education, or of the self-governing
instinct, or is deficient in two of these quali-
ties, or is ill-provided with all three. One
remarkable feature of Australia’s case is the
lack of means by which the community can
definitely express its mind on any subject,
assuming that it has a mind on the subject
and cares to express it. A Federal referen-
dum is provided for if it is proposed to
alter the Constitution, but the process is
slow, and to carry anything it is necessary
to secure the assent of two-thirds of the
States and a majority of the aggregate votes
cast. Apart from constitutional amend-
ments_ no Federal referendum exists, but a
fair idea of popular sentiment may be
gathered at a general election as regards the
overwhelming question of the day in the
rare case of there being one, unless some
disturbing crowd makes it a three- or four-
party contest, in which case the minority
wins, and popular sentiment is smothered.
In State appeals the issue is complicated at
general elections by too many parties, split
votes, selection ballots with sliding-panel
ballot-boxes, and the fact that, in an extreme
case, which Westralia can show, one man’s
vote may be 32 times the value of another
man’s. The result is that the minority now
wins most of the time. The initiative and
the referendum had a long run as part of
the Labor programme, but the new brand
of Labor has no use for them. If they are
still on the programme, it is merely to stamp
them as Labor devices which Nationalists
and Country party cranks should avoid at
all costs. And Nationalists and Country
party cranks, having a tendency to fall into
the most obvious snares, do avoid them. With
more wisdom, they would make the referen-
dum, at all events, their aim and ambition,
both in Federal and State affairs, and let
Communist Labor have the onus of declar-
ing it a “capitalistic” institution.
* * * *
The referendum, in the hands of an intelli-
gent people gifted with the self-governing
instinct, has often served to put courage
into the majority by giving it a chance to
discover that it is the majority and a large
one, and that the roaring crowd which has
posed as the majority is barely enough to
make a quorum. It serves to bring to some
kind of definite issue questions which may
otherwise "be a bone of contention for years,
tearing parties and politics asunder. In
N. S. Wales, for instance, it might either
settle the New State question in the affirma-
tive straight away, or show that even on its
own ground it isn't a live question at all,
and isn’t likely to be one for years. Then
there would be no need for the anti-Commu-
llist forces to rend themselves asunder over it,
and in the process hand over the State to
the rule of Red visionaries with Moscow
ideas. It might have made a more satisfac-
tory settlement of the Federal capital matter;
but when the suggestion was made Prime
Minister Hughes developed a scorn for the
voice of the people worthy of a duke of the
George _ 111. vintage. It might even bo
used in industrial circles to decide strike pro-
blems, whereas the growing tendency is rather
to. decide by shriek and riot. It and the
initiative are regarded as essentials of govern-
ment in the best-conducted and most peaceful
republic that Europe or the world possesses,
and the system is spreading among the
younger States of the U.S. As the absolute
antithesis of Bolshevism the initiative and
referendum are due for adoption by those
sections of the Australian community which
have no desire to Bolsh. What scanty pro-
visions there are for letting the popular
voice have a hearing were supplied by the
makers of the Federal Constitution, and they
didn’t Bolsh.
THE CONQUERORS OF EUROPE.
Running in out of the long surges of the
South China Sea, the narrow-gutted M.M.
liner, as cranky as a native dugout, gives a
final frightful lurch and becomes 'steady
against the yellow tide of the Mekong. We
pick up a pilot at Cape St. James, where is
an English cable-station, manned largely by
Australians, and steam up the river towards
Saigon, chief city of French Indo-China.
The chaste white rice-birds sail over the
tiny squared fields that show every variety
of green ; the brown backs of men in umbrella
hats bend earthwards, and the shiny black
heads of women and children bob up and
down; hooded bullock-carts trail along the
roads like drifting villages, and a motor-car,
like a loutish comet rioting through an
ordered universe, tears honking across the
leisurely picture; cocoanut palms and ban-
anas droop in the heat over little basketwork
houses where “the babies sprawl listlessly,
oppressed by the twin burden of malaria in
the blood and overmuch smooth rice in the
belly.
It is a picture that is repeated over a
million square miles of country lying under
the hammer-beat of the sun between Canton
in China and Cape Comorin in India. That
vast vat of nature, coastal and insular, rich
as Croesus with a golden soil that is fed
by great rivers or fertilised by volcanoes, has
always carried a large population, but has
never learnt to rule itself. It is cluttered
with the ruins of temples, cities and palaces
left by alien conquerors; but the aborigines
still build their walls of Icajang and roof
them with atap and offer up thanksgivings to
the 89 uses of the nibong- tree and the 120
purposes of the cocoanut. The latest con-
queror is the white man. A great concrete
factory for the manufacture of something or
other goes By upon the bank. It is the
symbol of the inscrutable forces that drive
the European to impress his ideals of pro-
gress upon the indifferent denizens of basket-
work civilisations. First he compels the
native to buy his manufactured goods, so
that the population in the home country shall
grow beyond all reason and a few of it
shall prosper beyond belief; and then In;
teaches him to make the goods for him-
self and make them cheaper, so that the home
factories languish and the market dwindles,
and teachers arise to propagate the strange
doctrine that the salvation of Europe is
race-suicide by means of birth-control.
Saigon (120,000) is a wan white city be-
sieged on three sides by the tumultuous and
tangled vegetation of the tropics. It is a
white city that imagination colors red, for
into it the best blood of France has poured
since the French army, aided by native allies,
captured it in 1858. It is a pallid-looking
town pathetically like a hundred others that
the restless European has founded on his
own bones all along the coast of Asia. The
arrival of the steamer, crowded with young
ensigns for the army and recruits for the
civil service, with its steerage full of dull-
eyed Breton peasants and ex-Parisian
apaches conscripted to make the way smooth
for English and German bagmen, is a vital
circumstance in the dull monotony of
colonial existence. It means the pumping of
fresh blood into the controlling organism of
the country, exhausted by the drain of war,
fever and nostalgia. Pale men, with a blind-
ing aura of sunshine round their pith helmets
and white suits, climb up the gangway and
embrace and kiss these fresh-faced reinforce-
ments. That night there is a recrudescence
of gaiety in the cafes which decorate every
corner of the squares of this little metropolis
that Frenchmen sarcastically call the Paris
of the East. There is a gala night at the
Grand Opera House, where a Parisian com-
pany, under a State subsidy, performs “La
Tosca”; and slant-eyed, platter-faced Annam-
ite women drift along the palm-edged pave-
ments of the streets looking for fresh tem-
porary soldier-husbands in place of the ones
they are about to lose.
Periodically in Britain, France and other
European colonising countries there are
examinations for the selection of recruits to
man the vast empire that Europe polices
overseas. There are searching tests in engi-
neering, sanitary science, knowledge of
strange cultures, religious histories, laws and
a medley of languages and dialects spoken
by obscure tribes whose very existence was
unknown to the candidates before their selec-
tion of a colonial career. Those who pass
are seldom fools, and they are frequently
picked men of enterprise and intelligence.
Their dedication to this dream of colonial
expansion is so much loss to their home coun-
try, which needs all the roads, bridges, drains
and creative effort for its own improvement.
There are, however, countries which have
been cheated of the privilege of opening their
veins for the benefit of colored valetudi-
narians. They are ready to fight exhausting
wars for the right to do so, a right which the
countries in possession are ready to defend
to the last man and shilling.
The latest challenge resulted in the great-
est war the world has ever seen and very
nearly to the extinction of European civilisa-


tion; but the philanthropic powers are busy
preparing for the next. To what end on y
futurity will show, but the hospital of his-
tory is full of the debilitated frames
imperial people that failed to stand t
strain. Many observers already claim to sc 5
signs of anaemia in the French, who, with a
dwindling home population of 41 millions,
feed the veins of a colonial empire of nearly
50 millions ; who, with portions of their own
country going out of cultivation or relying on
imported labor, administer the affairs or
territories over 20 times as great.
A short railway ride from Saigon, through
a continuous cemetery of ancient omega-
shaped tombs, is Cholon, the Chinese city.
With its narrow streets, temples, spiritual
lightning guards and secret door screens, its
fat, smooth-faced merchants, real supermen
of industry, and the intense activity of its
streets, it might have been lifted holus bolus
out of Tzechuan or Yunnan. These stout
merchants, with their implacable eye tor
business, and their close association with the
native race, are the real inheritors. of the
country, who can view the spasmodic inva-
sion of English and German bagmen and
French gendarmes with equanimity. Ai.de-
bakan, god of power, alone knows when they
first conquered Cambodia. Further inland
is the exquisitely decorated rubbisli-heap ot
an ancient civilisation that came by way ot
India. Doubtless it found the Chinese tow-
kays here before it. They have survived the
squabbles of the English and the French
and will survive the present epoch.
As we run down towards the sea, our wake
dies in the sunset on the vast delta of the
river. Fishermen and peasants are trudging
homeward. Nothing, one feels, will over
alter the aspect of this countryside. The
native will continue to plod stolidly on his
way behind his straining bullocks because his
numbers are so vast and his wants so simple
that only a relative few of him have had
to leave the plough to make absurd objects
for the white man; and when the white man
lias ceased from troubling the few will go
back to their basket-work dwellings, and offer
up thanksgivings to the 120 utilities of the
cocoanut and the 89 properties of the nibong.
"In those years bears reappeared in
Europe” will be mayhap the laconic state-
ment of the historian of the future, conclud-
ing his story of how the white man drained
his blood away in Asia, teaching the Asiatic
the secret of Western power and civilisation.

PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Little New Tariff.
The amended tariff, evidently animated by
the best intentions, has made its appearance.
It was a long time coining, and some indus-
tries which deserved better fortune are dead,
or pretty nearly so, by reason of the delay.
Whether there is time to resuscitate them,
and whether the assistance offered is large
enough in all instances to encourage the
effort, it is hard to say. In any case the
revival is likely to be slow. While the rest-
ful Ministry lingered, Australian manufac-
tures being a matter which could take its
time while a Canadian reciprocity treaty
couldn’t, the well-informed importers stocked
up energetically and secured a good start.
The tariff document begins by reducing the
old duties on 42 lines, some of them cover-
ing various items. Of these 36 are to be
free under the British preferential tariff, 18
are to be free also under the intermediate
tariff, and 17 are to be free to the competi-
tion of the wide world. The goods which
are to come in untaxed are to a great extent
unimportant; still, the list includes carpets,
anchors, liammetred shovels, medicines not
manufactured in Australia (this may serve
to stop an Australian compound which
produces the same results with different ingre-
dients from securing a footing), watches.and
chronometers, and “vessels not commercially
built in Australia.” Very few vessels are
commercially built in Australia now, though
some are put together uncommercially out
of loan funds. The list of increased duties
goes into 45 lines, some covering more than
one article. One item is “chassis unassem-
bled,” which have the old 5 per cent, duty
taken off as regards the British article (it
is thus raised to “free”) and 2£
per cent, added to the foreign speci-
men. making it 12} per cent. There is
nothing ferocious about that rise. Perhaps
a casual printer put “chassis unassembled
into the wrong category. Tlip general policy
seems to be the old one of the_ starvation
limit, of being ungenerous and niggardly, of
giving the importer the benefit of the doubt,
and of treating Protection as an evil to be
minimised instead of as a virtue. Thus
whisky and gin (British preferential) are
increased from 30s. per gjallon to 355. there
is nothing so beautiful about whisky and
gin. which in 1924 took away about
£1.600,000 of good Australian money, that
the duty shouldn’t be 60s. If the present
generation couldn’t accustom itself to Aus-
tralian brandy as a substitute the next one
might, or the one after thjat. Tine raising ot
the British preferential etiarge on woollens
from 30 to 35 per cent, with a correspond-
ing lift on foreign articles will prove a help,
just as it is a help for a man who is drown-
ing in 20ft. of water to bg moved into 10ft.
There is no possible doubt, that this country
can supply its own woollen goods, and that
there is sufficient internal competition to pre-
vent monopoly. It is merely a question of
providing against low-wagje and long-hour
competition and the vagaries of exchange.
\s the Bruce Government has no earthly
chance of making Australian -wages lower
and Australian hours longer, it might as
well have gone the whole generous hog and
provided against the present, and left a
liberal margin for possibilities in the future.
Fairly liberal treatment (certainly liberal
from the Bkuce-Page point iof view) is given
to the machinery-making suction. The bill
for imported machines, machinery metals and
metal manufactures amounted to 43£ million
pounds in 1923-24. which wa s almost twice
the figure for 1921-22, so tiiere was room
for some belated activity in this direction.
It will be in keeping with the. Government s
record if it proves that, having? started on a
career of activity, it almost red died its desti-
nation. yet didn’t quite arrive*
The Right to Say “Go to Blanky
Perdition!”
When the Australian workman in the States
where trouble is chronic comes to his scat-
tered senses and analyses his position, if
he ever does anything so orderly, he may
be surprised to discover that the above is
the privilege for which he has been putting
up the fight of his life and the scrap of
ages. It isn’t very much of a privilege,
being neither food, drink, money nor clothes,
and supposing the workman ostensibly gets
it there is serious doubt whether he or some
hard master of the Johanson variety will
have it. Still, it is the essence of job-control.
The workman wants this blessing either be-
cause he does, or because he has been told he
does, or because he is liable to be suspended
or expelled from his union and doomed to
indefinite starvation if he lets it be known
that he doesn’t. He was apparently happy
enough before he had the privilege, or before
he had it to the present extent, but it is
alleged that he will be miserable if he goes
back to the state of not having it, or not
having it to the present extent. Meanwhile,
he has it to the present extent, and looks
miserable, or, at least, hysterical. The basic
idea is that if something is said to an em-
ployee, generally about the quality of his
work, by the man who pays for the work, he
should tell that man, in effect, to go to
blanky perdition, or depart _ into blinking
hades. In other words, he is expected to
state, or imply, that the quality of the out-
put won’t improve, and that any kind of
workmanship is good enough for the man
who supplies the wages. If _ this attitude
leads to discharge, then work is stopped till
the dischargee is reinstated, so that the whole
crowd may assert its right to do bad or worse
work and tell the boss to go to hades. Inci-
dentally there are two bosses —the man on the
job who supplies the employment and pays the
w'ages, and the man at the Trades or Com-
munist Hall who supplies nothing and
pays nothing. To tell the latter to go
to hades, or even to look at that place, is
almost as dangerous as it would have been
for Uncle Ton to take a running kick at
Licgree. This lias been brought home to the
Fordsdale seamen, who, because they failed
in the matter of instantaneous obedience,
have been pursued all over Australia with an
intensity of hatred for many months, and
chased out of every billet that offered. *Tob-
control isn’t an assertion of the right to bo
a unionist. That was fully asserted long
ago, and the non-unionist has ceased to have
any rights, even if he is “non ” because he
wasn’t allowed in, or because he was "dis-
ciplined” out with a high hand. It isn’t
a matter of wages (they are quarrelled about
separately), though it is generally a matter
of losing wages. It isn’t a matter of an asser-
tion of the right to continuity of employment.
Tlio Newcastle and Hunter River _S. S. Co.
was put under the ban of the union bosses
because it. gave continuous employment to
the same unionists, and the purpose of the
latest row ha s been to assert that the old
crew must not be regularly re-engaged for
the new voyage; the eld crew must be sacked
and a new crew, supplied froin Com-
munist headquarters, taken on instead.
Yet the demand that the men who paid
the wmges should be about the only ones
with no voice in the selection of the reci-
pients was only an enlargement of the trea-
sured idea of making to the employer the
trite observation contained in the headline.
It is a quaint example of the passing craze
that a crowd of physically grown-up persons
should be prepared to sacrifice their incomes
and even their country for the sake of
habitually telling the man who pays them
to go to blanky perdition, and being told
the same thing themselves much more effec-
tively by the man who doesn’t pay anybody.

After Ten Years.
The Queensland worker is assured by poli-
ticians of the Theodore species that he has
secured financial benefits from the Labor
policy, which has been in operation since
1915, and that an aggravation of the policy
must bring more benefits. Quite probably
some of him believe this. Yet there are big
discrepancies in the tale. The Queensland
factory-worker is the most poorly-paid on the
Australian mainland, the average rates for
1923-24 shown on page 15 of the latest
Federal Quarterly Summary being: —
N. S. Wales .. .. £194 1 1
Westvalia .. .. 190 4 5
S. Australia .. .. 188 " 5
Victoria .. .. .. 184 10 0
Queensland .. .. 179 4 2
Seeing that Queensland has a larger propor-
tion of males among its workers than N. S.
Wales, South Aus. or Victoria, the situation
is interesting. Melbourne and Brisbane are
regarded as representing two _ extremes in
politics, Liberalism and Laborism, or Con-
servatism and Communism. The Federal
Labor report (1924) compares the wages of
adult males in 697 lines of industry in these
two centres. In 61 cases the rates are equal,
in 190 Brisbane leads, and in 466
Melbourne is ahead. If the. new Labor-
ism pays the artisan, this calls for
explanation. Queensland’s situation would
be worse on the general average but
for the fact that, by the last figures, over one-
eighth of its factory-workers are in the
sugar-mills. Sugar, being protected to the
extent of absolute prohibition of imports,
and sold at a high fixed price, has been pay-
ing extraordinary wages for a few months’
work per annum. During the last year fac-
tory wages for all the States, including Tas-
mania, showed an average increase of
£7 13s. lOd. per factory-worker. The Queens-
land artisan got a rise of £1 10s. for his
share. The Victorian’s increase was £9 and
a few coppers. Despite the low wages paid
in Queensland they seem to be higher wages
than Queensland’s much-taxed and much
Communist-harried industries can stand. At
least, the increase in the State’s tally of
factory-’ands during the past two years was
2700. including sugar-mill operatives. Vic-
toria’s increase in the same time was 11,286.
As for the tale about Queensland’s railways,
it has been so often told that it grows mon-
otonous. It is mainly to the -effect that
they were the best-paying system that Aus-
tralia possessed in the year before Theodore,
and they aren’t now. In 1924 they showed
a loss of £1,412,900, or £294 per mile for
the year. All the other lines of the Com-
monwealth, including the three Federal ones
which are big enough to count (1 ort
Augusta-Kalgoorlie, Port Augusta-Oodna-
datta and Darwin-Katherine), lost £L4i,UUU,
or £7 19s. lOd. per mile. Westralia has tar
more railway to support in proportion to
population than Queensland has, yctit
showed a handsome profit in With
sane management, moderate industry and a
semblance of loyal service, the Queensland
lines could pay far better wages and show
a profit also. As it is, despite the tremend-
ous subsidy which they receive out of the
taxes, they are falling to pieces from neglect.
The moth is in them, likewise the weevil.
And this insolvent and dilapidated system
lias now been handed over to the employees
after a lawless strike and the most ignomini-
ous Government surrender on record.
The Death Penalty and the “Lifer.'’
In the archives of the Legislative Council of
N. S. Wales might be found an interesting
paper which was presented to both Houses
of the British Parliament in 1867 and in the
following year was reproduced by the Govern-
ment Printer in Sydney at the order of the
Council. It was the report of a Royal Com-
mission on capital punishment, and even after
this lapse of time it contains some informa-
tion of great value. Several “Barons,” as they
then were, and other Judges gave evidence.
One of these learned witnesses was asked:
“Do you think that any punishment would
be a sufficient substitute for death in capital
cases ?” The answer was: “I think it would
be a very dangerous experiment. I am quite
sure that if you abolish capital punishment
murder would be much more common.” Still
another Judge put it thus: “I think it is
very important to leave to every criminal the
strongest possible motive to abstain from
murder.” Another witness was asked:
“What induces sTou5 T ou to say that the criminal
is more alive to the fear of death than to the
fear of any other punishment?” This wit-
ness, who had had many years’ experience in
prison-administration, replied: “Because it
is my belief that the love of life is the strong-
est feeling which these people have.” He was
further asked (and this is a point of great
practical importance) : “Is there a consider-
able difficulty in dealing with prisoners who
have no hope of a remission of their sen-
tences?*’ To this he answered: “In my ex-
perience there would be only one way of
treating a man whom you shut up without
hope, namely, simply to treat him like a
wild beast, because you would have no power
over him. It does not signify what he does,
or doesn’t, you cannot do any more to him.”
A witness who had been on the staff of the
convict administration in W.A. after trans-
portation had ceased gave an instance of the
effect of the death penalty within his experi-
ence. In the early days of “the system” it
was found that there was a strong tendency
on the part of convicts to assault the officers
in charge of them. Several bad cases occurred,
and it was determined to put the law in force
and punish such offences by death. A case
occurred and the offender was hanged. “From
that time,” said the witness, “the crime may
almost be said to have ceased. We never
had any more trouble.” An interesting side-
light thrown on the matter from _tlie_ point of
view of the criminal —and, incidentally,
also of his keepers—was furnished by a
writer in the latter part of the last century
in relation to the same penal settlement. A
convict found means to surreptitiously pass
out a letter addressed to a friend in England.
The addressee could not be found, and the
letter came in the usual course to the dead-
letter office. It was returned to the authori-
ties in Perth and there was opened and read.
In it the writer informed his friend that in
the colony there was then a law which made
a murderous assault on a warder a capital
offence. He communicated the fact in the
following words: “They top [hang] a cove
out hero for slogging a bloke. That bit of
rope, dear Jack, is a great check on a man’s
temper.”
Denny’s Splinter of Dynamite.
Stung by criticism, some of it very personal
and particular, of his Governments Thousand
Homes scheme, W. J. Denny, the S. Aus.
Labor Attorney-General, answered a Par-
liamentary question as follows: —
The Government is giving serious consideration _to
the introduction of a bill which, while permitting
the greatest freedom of speech, will prevent public
institutions and the personal honor of members
being attacked. A member making such attacks will
have withdrawn from him the protection and privi-
leges given by Parliament and be subject to the
same conditions as apply to people making state-
ments. from the public platform.
If Denny goes on with his proposal some
good may come out of the Thousand Homes
fiasco. His words might have been better
chosen, but presumably he doesn’t aim at
restricting honest criticism of public insti-
tutions ; the object is to make the mud-
throwing type of politician responsible at law
for some of his ruffianly outbreaks, at least.
But the right to sue for libels published in
Parliament should be conceded to all citizens,
instead of being restricted to politicians and
public servants, if that is the idea. The
latter have a special grievance, inasmuch as,
though repeatedly traduced in Australian
Parliaments (especially in the House of
Reps, and the N.S.W. Leg. Assembly), they
are denied the right of reply; but, even so,
discrimination would be unjust. The total
exemption of legislative utterances from the
laws of libel and slander may have been
necessary at one time, but in these days it
has become a dangerous anachronism, useful
only for the purposes of political black-
guards, and a factor in the degeneracy of
Parliament. What is needed is such a cur-
tailment of the privilege as will enable pro-
ceedings to be taken, and damages recovered,
by persons whose character has been wan-
tonly and recklessly assailed in Parliament,
while permitting a member whose words were
actionable but whose intentions were honest
to successfully plead that the said words,
though untrue and now apologised for. were
uttered (a) without malice, (b) after rea-
sonable inquiry, and (c) in the belief that
their publication would be in the public
interest.

Oil.
Dr. Wage’s report on Australian oil possi-
bilities boils down to an opinion that the
best thing the Commonwealth can do m
the matter is to give serious attention to its
kerosene shales. There is a great deal to be
said for that view. At any rate, we know
we have the shale, in very large quantities,
and, in a few cases, of exceptional quality;
and Avliile it is not at all certain that avc
have free oil in operable pools, it is certain
that the alluring search for floAving bores
turns attention aside, not only from the
known shale-beds, but from all other pos-
sible sources of liquid-fuel supply. Aus-
tralia has been singularly unfortunate in the
handling of its kerosene-shales. Its Wolgan
and Capertee beds (N.S.W.) are among the
Avorld’s greatest, if not actually the greatest:
their devastating misfortune was that 20
years ago they fell into the hands of an Eng-
lish company whose mishandling of practi-
cally everything it did Avas 50 per cent, farce
and the rest tragedy. Not only did it waste
a million and do nothing Avortk mentioning
with its oAvn deposits, but it. took over and
actually closed down other mines and works
which have never since been re-opened. The
one comforting feature is that it left the
deposits almost virgin; and they still await
intelligent exploitation, though Avliether the
business can be made profitable with labor
in its present uncertain temper is another
matter. Certainly it has very little hope if
the Commonwealth will not give it more
tariff help than it offers to its own Oil
Refineries.

The Decline of the Cradle-filling
Industry.
Dear Bulletin. —The author of “The
Advantages (or Otherwise) of National Sui-
cide” (B. 20/8/’25 ) is apparently an oppo-
nent of birth control, but it would have been
interesting if he had indicated how he pro-
posed to prevent it being practised. The
first method I can call to mind of discourag-
ing birth control is moral exhortation. The
bulk of the religious bodies are nominally
opposed to its practice (though the fact that
parsons’ families tend to be much smaller
than formerly seems to suggest that emphasis
must be laid on the “nominally”), but the
churches’ influence in matters affecting the
The Polyglot Nightmare.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“On the Oephee which arrived this afternoon from
France were passengers from Holland Kussia,
France, Mauritius, Belgium, Serbia, Kouinama,
Greece, Poland, Palestine, Switzerland, Italy, byua,
Portugal and Czccho-Slovakia. There were also
several Australians.” — Melbourne Herald.
I t.ived last night a pallid dream,
Wherein it seemed to me
My bed was somehow under steam
Upon a wintry sea.
A wind was blowing from the Pole;
Its dank and clouded breath
Across the blackened water stole,
Till night was dark as death.
And as I clambered, open-lunged,
The yells died in my throat;
A noise I heard as many-tongued
As Babel come afloat.
A ghost-grey ship came shouting then,
From out the dripping mist,
In ev’ry language know to men
And some not on my list.
I hailed her there with sudden might
That all but cracked my cheek;
“What ship is this?” I asked the night;
“Australia do ye seek?”
And one said “Ja!” and one “Ah, oui !”
(I understood them both),
And some said “Tszwxcu!” and some said
“Si!”
And one “My oath!”
“Then tell me, you Australian cove,”
I asked the last that spoke,
“What sort of cattle do you drove
On this unholy joke?”
And answer made he through the gloom:
“They’re Hollanders and Russians these,
And French and Greeks and Polacks,
Roumanians and Portuguese,
And Serbs and Czecho-Slovaks, _
And lads from Syria, Palestine,
And Switzerland , and near the Rhine- —
And in the small remaining room
Are several Australians
* * * *
And as I listened, all agog,
Too dazed to raise a groan,
That gabbling ship was lost in fog,
And I was left alone.
And then, it seemed, for many years
I sailed the dreary sea;
And none, for all my bitter tears,
Came near the bed and me.
From day to night, from dark to light,
I saw nor ship nor land,
Until my beard was growing white,
And tremulous my hand.
At last upon a misty morn
A welcome shore I spied ;
For half a hundred years forlorn
I’d tossed upon the tide.
And men there came adown the beach
To view the sorry wreck;
And one I hailed with quav’ring speech
And fell upon his neck.
“What land is this, O blessed man,
That saves me from the sea?”
I wildly asked and turned to scan
The crowd that gaped at me;
For strange were they unto my sight,
And mostly swart or brown.
“What people these,” I begged in fright,
“That look me up and down?”
Then answered he: “Australia this!
They’re Hollanders and Russians these,
And French and Greeks and Polacks,
Roumanians and, Portuguese
And Serbs and Czechoslovaks,
And lads from Syria. Palestine,
And Switzerland, and near the Rhine.
Here, too, though these you’re like to miss,
Are several Australians’’

individual's interests is rather scanty to-day.
Again, apart from conventional and obsoles-
cmg morality, there is nothing about birth
control that causes it to appear actually
wrong or wicked to the enlightened intellect,
feo it. appears as if moral exhortation isn’t of
much use in this matter. The plea of
national necessity isn’t likely to have much
more influence on the individual than the
moral objection. It would be a unique couple
indeed who decided to invest lavishly in in-
fants because of national necessity. And
they would certainly bo fearful of other
couples blacklegging on them. A law pro-
hibiting the publication and distribution of
literature on birth control and the sale of
contraceptives would increase the birth-rate
amongst the more ignorant and impoverished,
but it would be an easy law to evade and a
dashed unpopular law to be connected with.
,I’he bonus method of swelling the ouput of
infants is the one most likely to be popular
m this country. It would have to be a pretty
big bonus, however, to be effective. Five
pounds is not enough, and fifty would pro-
bably be very little better. A hundred might
produce some slight results; but the trouble
is it would be necessary to pay for every
child born on account of the impossibility of
identifying the ones that had been actually
purchased. This would cost a tremendous lot
oi money, which would have to be borrowed,
and posterity would be embittered and pro-
bably turn Bolshevik because of the bonus
that encouraged it to be born. If birth control
could be proved to be physically injurious the
birth-rate might begin to look better (though
lots of things have been shown to be injuri-
ous and people have merely clamored for
more of them), but proof has not arrived at
this late hour, and this fact suggests that it
doesn’t exist. Some people still insist that
if the standard of living was improved the
arrival of infants might be more frequent,
but all the evidence points in an opposite
direction. It is where the standard of living
is lowest that the birth-rate is Usually high-
est. As & last desperate resort a religion
might be started which would insist, in the
style of the Orient, that multitudinous off-
spring on earth is essential to any sort of hap-
pmses in Heaven. But, since there are plenty
more plausible religions at large which fail to
attract much attention, saving during elec-
tions,. it would be foolish to place confidence
in this chance. There are no other methods
known to me of increasing the birth-rate,
and, so far as this community is concerned,
the ones enumerated above don’t look much
bke methods either. The fact must be faced
that small families, are more suitable to the
high standard of living now demanded than
large ones, distinctly more favorable to the
modern feminine viewpoint, and (it seems
highly probable) better for the health and
happiness of the children who do arrive.
Against this combination the plea of national
necessity is but a thin unheeded voice in the
wilderness. The most that can be done is
to see that survivals after birth are as plenti-
ful as possible. And. for the rest, our best
chance lies in the dual encouragement of
immigration and industrialism. Here there
is some hope of results from legislation.-

Lildad : A son ol tin? late ex-Premier
McGowen, of N. S. Wales, speaking at a
Nationalist meeting at Narrabri, struck a
rather pathetic biographical note:—
He was an opponent of the present principles of
the Labor party, which were totally different from
those put forward by his father in 1891, when the
Labor party consisted of good, sound politicians.
.Tyist before the death of his father he had told
him (the speaker) that the castle he had struggled for
and built was fast toppling- to the ground. The way
the present Labor organisation had treated his
father and his followers was a shame and a disgrace.
It is doubtless pleasant to paint the sunrise
of 1891, when the Labor party made its first
appearance in Parliament. And, barring
internal dissensions, things did wear an
aspect of promise for about 20 years. Then
Labor got into power, with McGowen as
Premier, and the promise vanished. Honest
finance was a fashion then—in words, any-
how —and in bidding for popularity at the
election which put Labor into office the com-
ing Premier was lavish in promises. Summed
up, the extravagant borrowing of past years
was to be cut down, no loan money was to
be spent save on works which would pay
full interest and sinking fund, a sinking fund
was to be provided against the existing debt,
and it was even suggested that loans should
be abolished, and the land revenue applied
to public works purposes. The loan expen-
diture of the previous 20 years had averaged
£2,200,000 per annum. The additions to
the public debt for the first three complete
years of Labor finance in the Ma State were
4_|, 0 and 10£ millions, and after that the
rise was 11 millions. It is impossible to fix
an exact date when demoralisation and de-
gradation set in through the introduction of
borrowing as a substitute for honest work,
but a plausible date coincides with the N. S.
Wales Parliament of. 1910, with Labor in
power for the first time, and J. S. T.
Me Go wen as Premier.

may be seen in Italian settlements in the
Victorian diggings country and in German
settlements in N.S.W. and S.A.—only pro-
nounced and harsh-sounding foreign names
mark the Aussie as not descended from Saxon
or Celt, and the Milners, Dalteras, Gold-
mans, Rosenthals, Cannots, Besants
and Jardines pass without comment. If
non-Britons are to be absorbed the sooner
the absorption takes place the better for the
Commonwealth ; and Australia would achieve
homogeneity more quickly by trying to estab-
lish Anglo-Celtishness in its peoples names.
Though as a nation we protest our liberality
of thought, in reality we Australians are
conservatives of the conservatives. The
native of Anglo-Celtic descent is inevitably,
even though unconsciously, deflected from
true oneness of nationality when he encoun-
ters a brother-native with a name which ends
in Teuton ein, or Slav ski, or Latin i, o or a.
Though he does not want to think it, a de-
Dago !” (or Hun, Frenchie,
Role or Yid, as the case may be) flashes
through his mind and registers a mild an-
tagonism. The same occurs in the mind of
the_ so-called foreigner: it is his and our
heritage of the ages. It would assist absorp-
tion remarkably if the newcomer w T ere encou-
raged as early as possible to sound as Aus-
tralian as he looks: it would be a fine step
towards making him feel Australian. The
non-Briton is naturally as proud of his
ancient name as the Briton and as a true
patriot is loath to change it, but, after all,
the Anglo-Celtic tongue (called for conveni-
ence English) is the language of the Com-
monwealth, and no one intending to be a
good citizen of the Commonwealth should
object to adopt it. An arbitrary re-naming
is not suggested: only a translation or its
nearest equivalent. A great many names in
foreign tongues, as in English, Scotch and
Irish, have a meaning as well as a sound
and could be translated: others could take
the nearest English sound.

“Country Ped” : Twelve years ago the Vie.
Education Department established a special
school for the feebleminded; other similar
schools are projected from which pupils will
be transferred to farm colonies, where they
will be segregated from the cares and trials of
modern life, and where they will not have the
opportunity of transmitting their mental defi-
ciency to generations yet unborn. The
scheme is a sound one; but while attending
to the subnormal the Department is neglect-
ing the supra-normal. If those on the low
plane of mentality are to have special schools
and treatment, so should those on the high
plane. Professor Terman, the originator of
the Stanford Revision of the Binet-Simon
mental tests, has found that “for every child
of any given degree of deficiency there is
another child as far above the average as
the former is below.” In U.S.A. they are
making provision for the smart children,
whose range of intelligence is from superior
to genius, by the opening of special schools
for them. The most that is done in Aus-
tralia is that in the larger schools grades are
divided into three divisions, children being
placed according to their mental ability,
roughly noted by superficial observation and
annual examination tests. But we still
Promote by age alone instead of by mental
efficiency. Consequently the children of
superior intelligence are held back at the risk
of their abilities being sidetracked or atro-
phied. An occasional one breaks through the
cordon of scholastic conventions, and the
whole nation is surprised into noticing the
fact, as it was when the late John Hunter
became Professor of Anatomy at Yet
for every imbecile child in our mentaV hospi-
tals and asylums, there is another child
attainments akin to genius, who
is not getting a lair chance. To provide
special schools for our children of superior
intelligence is practically impossible at pre-
sent. Hut with consolidated rural schools,
instead ot tiny one-teacher academies, it
would be possible; and if every child is to
equal chance to secure the education
equal to his or her mental ability the little
country schools must go.

X.R.N. ’: A M.L. paper devoted a column
to the views of one of Uncle Sam’s gun-
pointers who assured the interviewer, among
other things, that “the petty officer can make
or mar the gunnery of a ship.” Naval gun-
nery long since ceased to be the individual
business that it was in Nelson’s time, and
the gunlayer nowadays carries very much less
responsibility than he did even 20 years ago.
No individual and no class of individual of
whatever rank or rating can make or mar
modern naval gunnery. It is only the co-
ordinated efforts of the wdiole executive side
ot a ship’s company that can do that. The
directing- head is the gunnery officer, and the
work ranges down through other officers to
the director layer in one direction and to
the guns through the transmitting station
in another. Even the bandsmen have a hand
m the game, and I say without hesitation
that the simplest job of the whole lot is that
ot the modern gunlayer. The man behind
the gun is not still “the crux of the matter.”
It is the organisation behind the gun—some-
times a long way behind—that counts. That
is where American ideas are all wrong. Their
tendency is to glorify the individual; the
R.JN. tendency is to merge the individual into
the organisation—without his realising it.

POLTITCAL
POINTS
Westralia lias had bitter experience of
Walsh-Johanson strikes. So when Lang
suggested by wire that the constitutionality
of the Federal Deportation Act should be
challenged by the State Governments in
the interests of alien lawbreakers and indus-
try-stranglers, costs to be charged up to the
taxpayers, Collier, the Labor Premier,
snubbed him properly, as follows: —
Consider that testing validity of Commonwealth
Acts should be limited to statutes affecting State
interests, and that responsibility for testing Deporta-
tion Act devolves upon those directly affected.
Gillies (Q.), on the other hand, agreed to
join in. It might have been thought that
the unspeakable Queensland Government
after its surrender to the railway strikers
would have tried to mind its own muddled
business, instead of butting into Common-
wealth questions. But evidently it is as
thick in the head as it is cold in the feet.
The attitude of Lang and Charlton on
the deportation issue seems to be that,
although restriction of immigrants is a
virtue, it is a crime to expel any undesirable
alien who belongs to “the movement,” ot;
says he does. If that is so the records ot
the British, U.S., S’African, French and
Italian Governments are black with crime.
When the Bolshevists tried to do in America
what has been done so often in this country,
the Washington Government deported hun-
dreds of “working-class martyrs,” amongst
them the Russian Jewess Emma Goldman,
who had lived in America much longer than
the Dutchman Johanson has lived in Aus-
tralia. Emma got a free ticket to the Red
Republic, which, however, she quitted after a
few months, proclaiming it a hell upon earth.
Also, the M.L. Government deported Lyons,
the “ham-and-egg” striker, who wasn’t even
an alien, though a gassy nuisance. Terrible
things were going to happen if Lyons was
chucked out, but somehow they didn’t.
The position with regard to deportation
wants clarifying. When a man is a per-
sistent thief and punishment for theft
doesn’t deter him from thieving, we lock
him up under an indeterminate sentence —
give him a Kathleen Mavourneen. Occa-
sionally, if he is a foreigner, the Court will
give him three days to leave the country.
Now, industrial arbitration is the law of
the land; and the machinery of government
is directed towards preventing strikes. When
a man persistently promotes 'strikes he thus
puts himself in exactly the. same position
as the man who is a persistent thief—he
makes a practice of refusing bo recognise the
law. But inasmuch as the thief may thieve
for his own benefit while the other may be
a lawbreaker for others’, beriefit, the law
declines to treat them quite alike; so while
one is shut up, the law merely hells the other
(though it is to be feared it does it very
clumsily) to go back to his o\qn country
on the principle that every factory ought to
consume its own smoke.
Australians had better keep an eye on
the ballot system, or that will go next. To
some extent it has gone already, in fact;
and you only had to listen to the scorn
which Johanson poured on the proposal to
hold a “secret ballot” in the seamen s
trouble to realise what dSinger is ahead.
It was stated last week that out of the
crowd of British seamen who came ashore on
strike against their own unions about 200
had already found jobs in or around Sydney.
The balance (and the attendance when they
meet at the Communist Hall has been set
down at 150 O) are looking for work, and the
strike secretary has announced hopefully that
they may all be provided for soon and may
settle here. The idea of there being 200 jobs
at union wages vacant about Sydney and
available for strangers at such short notice
came as a surprise to local unemployed, who
thought the market was slack. Some of them
still think so.
The Labor expulsion machinery is working
with painful slowness in the case of Tas.
Senator Ogden, who differs from some other
moderates in not being a cocktail. It is two
months since Ogden was threatened with
deportation—that is, expulsion—for support-
ing bills designed to rid the country of
foreign-born nuisances who have been doing
their darnedest to throttle it industrially,
but he still remains in “the movement,”
although he has voted for another anti-
Commurfist measure since. The difficulty is
that the Charlton party may need his vote
if it gets a House of Reps, majority at the
general election. Although 11 Labor Sena-
tors were elected for six years in 1922, there
are only eight left, exclusive of Ogden. At
least li more will be required, and contri-
butions are very unlikely to come from
Westralia, which is no longer a Labor State,
or Queensland, which hasn’t returned a
Labor Senator since 1917. There are 16
seats to be contested in N.S.W., Vic., S. Aus.
and the Speck, but even if 10 Laborites
get in the supposititious Charlton Govern-
TEE ABDICATION.
ment will be dependent on Ogden’s vote. So
the guillotine stands idle, though the Jacobins
of the A.L.P. passionately demand the
“traitor’s” head. It is a sorrowful thing to
have to restrain yourself from expelling an
erstwhile “comrade” for voting according to
his convictions, but in this case it can’t be
helped.
The N.S.W. Government proposes to go
back to single electorates, first past the post
to win. This shows its abiding faith that
the Country party won’t improve with age,
but will go on splitting the Opposition—
chiefly on the question of duty-free agricul-
tural'implements, though no State Govern-
ment can decide that question even if the
C.P. keeps on splitting the Opposition till
the South Bole boils over.
The Queensland Labor Government, while
professing to favor arbitration, has passed
a hatful of measures for the encouragement
of the striker. The Unemployed Insurance
law is one of them; under it the Govern-
ment paid out £l5OO at Townsville alone
during the few weeks of the shipping hold-
up early this year. The same thing has
been happening lately all over the State.
The disaffected union knows that any com-
rade” put out of a job through a strike will
have his cupboard filled by the State!
it goes ahead quite cheerfully. This is
merely another method of making the hat
man pay for the fuel that he is to be grilled
over.
The Queensland Labor Government was
spared no humiliation by the railway men
in its defeat. When traffic was resumed,
the first trains went out with red flags flying,
whistles making farmyard, noises,, and a dis-
play of banners with inscriptions about
keeping the red flag flying, and appeals to
the Workers of tlie World to unite —with
Moscow. The “generous enemy” pose wasn’t
even attempted. Yet the crowd which was
so unpleasant will doubtless stand by Min-
isters at the election of 1926, so that it may
be more unpleasant next time.
Pratten’s proposal for “encouraging”
Australian-made photoplays is to place
British films on the free list and let the
farcical duty on the foreign article remain
at lid. per foot. This w T ill help Britain
little," the British industry having been almost
destroyed by American dumping, and hurt
Australia a lot. The truth seems to be
that neither Nationalists nor Laborites are
game to tackle the film-importing interest,
both great parties being afraid of alienating
the ticket-seller and usherette vote. bo
Australia loses an industry which, if suffi-
cient Protection were afforded, might use-
fully employ 10,000 of its sons and daughters ;
and Hollywood, with its bad manners and
worse morals, monopolises the cinema edu-
cation of the Australian youth.
Watt, K.C., appeared at the. top of his
voice before the Deportation Board on behalf
of Walsh and his mate, and insisted on the
latter being described as Johnson, though
he was willing to answer to Johanson,
Joliannsen, Johannson, or any old term when
he recently “threw himself on the mercy ot
the Court” on another charge. In the
course of the proceedings Watt stated that
the Board w r as “the most cowardly that has
ever been called together.” As the judicial
body made no protest but let the slur on
its courage pass, it was difficult for anyone
else to rush in and defend it.
Tenders are being called by the Federal
Government for 871 miles of railway (27
miles in N.S.W. and 601 in Queensland)
between Kyogle and Brisbane, to cost
£3,500,000 (or £40,000 per mile)—and the
inevitable rest. A stranger might wonder
that N.S.W. should have battled for a dupli-
cate connection with Brisbane, which is no
great port, and should be battling for a third
connection, warranted to lose over £200,000
per annum, via Grafton and Killaruey, in-
stead of first joining its own hinterland with
its own coast by way of Inverell, Grafton
and Coff’s Harbor. But it is a fixed law
of the N.S.W. Congestion game to send
border trade to the next State’s big port
instead of using it. to create a second big
port of its own. Melbourne, for instance,
can’t become the centre of a Ma State seces-
sion movement, while Twofold Bay might.
Hence the proposed £40,000-or-more-per-
mile mountain duplicate railway. The work
is, of course, advertised as useful for rushing
troops thi’ough without break of gauge, but
a lino which can be bombarded from the sea
at various places is an unsafe place for
troops in war time. Napoleon struggled over
the Alps to avoid an easy shore road like that.
This quaint strike item is from Brisbane
Courier :
When asked why the wheels of industry had
stopped, Mr. Theodore sidestepped the question, say-
ing that, as lie was a candidate for Federal honors, the
position did not interest him.
The said Mr. Theodore, whatever his future in-
tentions, is still a member of the State Parlia-
ment, and is still being paid £5OO a year by
the State whose Government railway strike
didn’t “interest” him. A similar feeling may
inhabit the souls of many politicians, but
they are not often so frank about it.
The humorous McComb, Labor’s stalwart
in M.L. House of Reps., complained of the
tremendous increase in the defence vote,
which was not carrying out the spirit of
the Washington Conference. The country,
he said, was setting the world the worst
possible example. The upkeep of Maori-
land’s division of John Bull's Navy—her
indigenous fleet is not worth mentioning—
cost last year £285,723, and the debt charges
amounted to £80,243, so Maoriland can go
on setting a bad example for a long time
before the world is likely to notice it.
The United States, though little given ta
Public Enterprise, tried its hand at ship-
owning during the war, and came into pos-
session of 2200 arks of one sort or another.
It still possesses about 1200, of which three-
quarters were lately idle. It is gradually
selling off, the Yankee politician being no
better at Public Enterprise than the average.
The deficit is set down at £600,000,000. But,
after all, losses don’t matter so much pro-
vided they are paid oft’ honestly out of re-
venue ; and as the United States reduced its
Federal debt by over £800,000,000 between
1919 and 1924, it apparently cleared away
the shipping item and other matters besides.
Financial rottenness only sets in when the
debris of wild-cat finance is not cleared away,
and wheinalosses and depreciation on rail-
ways and tramways and ships and irriga-
tion works are handed down to posterity
among the “permanent and reproductive”
assets which accompany the permanent and
largely unproductive debt.
Victoria’s Coalition Government is look-
ing forward with no great pleasure to the
division on the second reading of the Volun-
tary Wheat Pool Bill in the Assembly. If
three of the left-wing Cockies vote with the
28 Laborites the Government can win by
two in a full House. If the worst happens,
and there is a tie (due to four Cockies join-
ing Labor), Speaker Bowser will vote with
the Government and save the. bill. In com-
mittee a determined effort will be made by
the anti-coalitionists to dethrone the direc-
tors of the present Wheat Corporation and
provide for a Board elected by the growers
by postal ballot. But this will be resisted hard.
The second-reading debate on the State
Employees’ Superannuation Bill was the
best the Vic. Assembly has heard in recent
years. It extended over two nights, and the
members who spoke gave evidence of having
taken some pains to prepare their matter.
The outstanding reason why the discussion
had a good tone was that the measure was
treated as non-party. Only two or three
Laborites were incorrigible—they could nor
forbear playing to the gallery by suggesting
£4 a week as the maximum for a pensioner;
and one provoked a wry smile by suggesting
that the scheme should be extended to mem-
bers of Parliament.
“Old Parliamentary Hand”: Two Vic.
M’s.P. are under treatment by Chinese her-
balists, and there is a story current in poli-
tical circles that a former notability of the
med. profession in Melbourne is indebted to
one of the same tribe for a fresh lease of
life. It looks as if Argyle will have trouble
in getting through any legislation antago-
nistic to herbalists at present. The petition
from 6000 patients presented to the Assem-
bly two months ago made a considerable
impression.
The Westralian Parliament had a remark-
able attack of unanimity the other day; in
fact, there has seldom been anything like
it save when a salary rise was on the board.
The topic was the duty which rested on the
States generally to pay a bonus on West-
ralian gold because, as the man in charge
put it, “all other industries were enjoying
the benefit of Protection, or were assisted
by bonuses or bounties.” Yet Westralia
sends a noisy group to the Federal Parlia-
ment to say that Protection is a curse, and
Australia has a free list as long as a giraffe’s
neck.

leader said in denunciation of the Communists who
have been holding up Australian and British ships
for many months.... N.S AV. Labor Premier Lang is
championing the cause of Walsh and Johanson....
The Queensland Labor Government gave the railway
strikers everything they demanded. In celebration ot
the victory the Red Flag was flown and cheeis
were given for the Revolution.”

Whom pale-pink editors puff
(Feeding with pap their readers),
Though fashioned of sorry stuff.
Brave, when defiance bawling
At “Fat, who swindles and robs,”
But crawling, cravenly crawling,
To blatant, plundering mobs.
These are our “White” Australians,
Greedy for cheap applause,
Who tremble when turbulent aliens
Mock at Australia’s laws.

White is their flag of retreat,
White are their gills and livers,
And cold, ice-cold, are their feet.

The first stage of the battle to decide whether
Walsh and Johanson ought to be deported was
devoted to skirmishing between the legal outposts.

while Mr’. Watt, K.C., refused to recognise the
claim, has a face shaped like a Crusader’s helmet
and a voice charged with a tired urbanity. Mr.
Watt has thin temples, a long nose, a toothbrush
moustache, discharges his hasty rhetoric out of a
corner of his mouth, and endeavors to disconceit ms

pense justice as infallibly as a slot machine delivets
chocolate, adorned the bench. Over the humorous
knobs and buttons of Chairman A. S. Canning’s
visage, the white face of Mr. de H. Rowland and
the square headpiece of Mr. F. J. Kindon, the
military member of the tribunal, the judicial mask
of unastonished incredulity was drawn.
The two principals, whom the mythopceic faculty
latent in newspaper reporters has elevated . into
demi-gods or anti-Christs according to the political
persuasion of the myth-receiver, did not come up to
expectations. Possibly through adenoids, Walsh lets
his mouth drop open, a little physical disability
which immediately destroys his aura of sinister and
romantic power. Also he did not seem to have the
faculty of following the proceedings closely. Johan-
son is a typical product of the Northern European
seaboard. He has yellow hair and a Cro-Magnon
skull and is in general a confutation of the “big
blonde Nordic” legend. If you look for his like
amongst his countrymen administering, exploring
and pioneering in the Dutch colonial empiie up
above Australia you will not find it. Doubtless
those outside the court thought those inside were
engaged in the presentation of stunning melodrama
like the trial of Shylock or Dean Maitland; but
forensic eloquence is uninspiring and liable to
frequent interruption from opposing counsel, and t e
aforementioned judicial mask would wreck the hna
curtain-fall at a Last Judgment. N evertheless, the
illusion will duly be created, and m course of tune
the adjective “dramatic” will doubtless go arm
in arm with the account of the proceedings into
the history books.

“Agent”: At a recent Sydney wedding,
when the happy couple had departed from
the church, indignation was expressed by
some of the ladies present at the manner in
which part of the decorations had been car-
ried out. Being a mere man and not having
noticed anything out of the way I made
inquiries, and was informed that an anti-
birth control enthusiast had filled the bap-
tismal font with forget-me-nots.

“X D ” : At the preliminary hearing of the
latest’ Melbourne “mystery” case, a witness
deposed that when she had announced hci
intention of going to a slied to get some
wood, the accused had said, No, don t you
come. Stop there, and I’ll bring some to you.
It was in this shed that the dead body was
presently found. On the morning following
the hearing a boardinghouse-keeper who
was in the habit of delivering breakfast to
a married couple upstairs was on her way
with a tray, when the man met her at the
foot of the stairs and said You needn t
carry that tray, Mrs. Hashliouse. Give it
to me; there’s no need for you to come up-
stairs.” A few minutes later the police,
who had received a ’phone message about a
“dreadful murder,” burst m upon an aston-
ished young couple who were happily break-
fasting together! Seeing a sinister resem-
blance between the words used by her lodger
and those said to have been used by the accused
in the murder case, the imaginative landlady
had jumped to conclusions, fallen into hys
toics ami similarly alarmed two other
women ; and the call to the police had been
a mutual effort. »
“Up*Top”: I saw a nigger “go west” in
a startling fashion.
The lugger was
cruising off Cape
Melville (N.Q.) in
dirty weather, and
aboard was a Mel-
ville “boy” pining
to visit his sweet-
heart. In an un-
guarded moment
h e slipped the
dinghy over the
side and was away
down the wave
crests laughing de-
lightedly as the
wind blew away
the skipper’s furi-
ous curses. He got
through the surf
right enough, and
we saw his nigger
cobbers running
down to meet him.
Then the dinghy
was completely
blotted out by a
sheet of fire, and
the welcoming nig-
gers streaked for
the bush like black
bandicoots. Later
w e learned the
lightning had shat-
tered the dinghy
into matchwood
and settled Romeo.
It was a bit of a
shame, too, for
•Julie t, inconsol-
able, jumped over
the Melville cliffs.
There was no dis-
obedience on our
lugger after that.
The mana of the
skipper who could
kill a disobedient
boy by throwing a great and invisible tire-
stick at him quickly spread all along the
coast.

eligibles defer their applications to the bittei
end Among those who asked for the dole
for the first time last year were seven nona-
genarians. One, who was 90, claimed to have
been able to support himself up to that time;
another, aged 91, explained that Ins wife, o()
years his junior, had kept a boarding-house
until her death quite recently. A quarrel
with her daughter, with whom she had been
living, brought an old lady of 94 for the pen-
sion. “I’m not strong enough to smack her
as she deserves,” asserted the applicant, but
I’m not going to stand any nonsense from
her, so I want to be independent.
“Bullwhanger”: The
latest addition to regular
ports of call in the Islands
is Vanikoro, in the Santa
Cruz Group. Up till a
year or two ago the only
callers were recruiters
and trochus shellers, who
looked in occasionally;
but a syndicate obtained
a concession to fell the
kauri which is growing
there, and now the old
Burns-Philp steamer
Makambo calls regularly
to deliver stores and
bring back timber. The
timber camp is at a vil-
lage named Pau, right
opposite the passage in
the reef where La Pe-
rouse lost his ships, and
probably saved liis life.
The other two islands of
the group, “Big” Santa
Cruz and Utupua, are
still without white resi-
dents, but traders and
planters will probably be
attracted now that there
is a regular steamer. In-
cidentally, I know a
chap, Jack Matthews,
who lived in Graseiosa
Bay, on Santa Cruz, for
13 years, the only white
man in the whole of the
group. Matthews was
trading for Lever’s, and
he never saw people of
his own color except
when the missionary
steamer Southern Cross
blew in or Lever’s sent
a ship with stores, etc.
But he seems to have
thrived on it. I met him
in George-street, Sydney,
a few days ago, and he
was itching to get back.
The local blacksmith usually,
acted as undertaker, but he was in the midst,
of one of his periodical celebrations m the
pub, and old Ted was commissioned to make
the coffin. He was one of those out-back
characters who woi'k on the roads but are
open for any sort of employment that comes
along, a handy-man with one trouble he
stuttered. Work on the coffin, however, pro-
ceeded apace, until all that was needed was a
handful of screws to secure the lid. He
dropped into the store for these, but a bad
attack of stuttering left him vainly trying
to articulate the word “screws. At last,
after a lot of mumbling and whispering and
facial contortion, he gave it up in disgust.
“B-b-blast it,” he said, “I’ll b-b-blanky well
n-n-nail him in!”

«p p ” . Despite the number of immigrant
girls who arrive yearly to engage in domestic
service, the hole they are intended to fill
merely becomes larger. Of 354,00_ Aus-
tralian women who earned wages
in 1901, 110,431 were domestic ser-
vants; in 1921 there were 3000
less, although 110,000 more women
were working for pay. Apparently
plain Mary Ann is determined to
become Gwendoline, for it is com-
mercial pursuits” that shows the
greatest increase (120 per cent.)
in women employees, whilst the
75.570 female factory workers of
1901 had only increased to 118,S8o
in 1921. It is obvious from the
figures that the “domestic workers”
brought from England have no in-
tention of remaining Mary Anns.
The girl who is satisfied _ with
domestic service has no occasion to
l ( , nve England, where the servant problem
has become so acute that an organisation has
been formed to fill the gap with ex-service
men.

“X.N.0.”: “Huffin Guffin” (B. 3/0/’25)
wants to know why the Union Jack must
come down at sunset. The reason is purely
utilitarian, there being no object in keeping
a flag or ensign flying after dark when it
cannot be seen. The R.N. “rate-book value
of a full-sized white ensign even before the
war was £5, and there is no object in halv-
ing its life bv leaving it hoisted all night
as well as all day. For the same reason
British warships generally don’t hoist an
ensign at sea at all unless there are strange
vessels or land in sight.
A OLASSIC EXAMPLE.

prices charged for boots, walks daily on the boulevards barefooted, but
otherwise dressed in the height of fashion. with monocle, white gloves,
and gold-mounted walking-stick." -cable.

“Offsider” : Is a marriage really and truly
legal without the production of a ring at the
psychological moment? Recently a couple
were parried at Redfern (Sydney), though the
’groom had left the symbol of bondage at
home. The officiating prelate finished the
tragedy without it, and nobody seemed a bit
disturbed.

“Wang” : Don’t know about marriages on
banks of rivers, but I’ve seen baptisms cele-
brated there. It was at Wangaratta(Yic.) the
newly-started Baptist Church, having no
tabernacle, made shift with the local Theatre
Royal. One couldn’t expect a font in a
theatre but the Ovens River flows through
the town, and the news was broken to us m
the local paper that on the following Sunday
converts would be publicly baptised. Thiee
tents were erected on the river bank, anci
ALL JASONS.
“Nine out of every ten women seem to have
a mission in life.”
“Yes, and the tenth would marry, too, if
she got the chance.”
long before the time advertised for the cere-
mony the trees were crowded with specta-
tors. Then the parson appeared from one
of the tents,, clad in a long black gown, and
offered up a prayer. The converts emerged
next, three women, very similarly garbed,
and a man ; and while the choir sang hymns
they were led, one at a time, into the ri\et
and dipped.

THE STRIKE-BREAKERS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
September came with yellow rain,
Sun-shot with fire and rainbow lights.
The great black chargers of the plain
With gusty breath assailed the heights ;
But fast the riders of the spring.
Their rosy lances tipped with gold,
Swept down the broken skies to bring
Relief from the besieging cold.
A small green bugler on the hill
Cried to the nesting wrens beneath ;
And at the sound a daffodil
Broke into laughter from its sheath.
A girl went singing down the way,
An old man paused to feel the sun ;
Time set his foot on yesterday—
I knew the winter strike was done!

“Iverys”: A resourceful Maoriland youth
who recently visited his English relatives
was asked if he could speak Maori, and
not wishing to disappoint the relatives re-
plied that his one accomplishment in that
language was a couple of verses of “God
Save the King.” As his knowledge of Maori
was nil he hastily concocted a couple of
verses entirely of native place-names, and
these he sang to his own accompaniment
with tremendous success. So popular did
the item become that the vicar requested him
to give it at a village concert, and numerous
admirers begged him to write the words
down so that they might learn them also.
During his triumphal career he met only
one Maorilander, and as she confessed she
knew no Maori his success continued; and
doubtless in an English village there are
still folk singing the National Anthem in
Maori.
FIANCE AND FINANCIER.
MABEL: IT hat s wrong, dear? Has Hubert broken the engagement?”
MURIEL: “Worse! He played poker with Dad and broke HIM.”
“Ex-Dig.”: The grit that made the Anzacs
tamous has just been displayed by an ex-
soldier named Keating who is now a farmer
at Balliang East (Vic.). A bullet-wound
through the Jung incapacitated him until two
years ago: but since then, by sheer hard
work, he has won two good harvests, and
has built a home for his wife and children
between times. He was carting his furni-
ture to the completed dwelling the other dav
when some of it, slipping, knocked him under
the heels of the horses; and after he had
been kicked the wheels of the wag-
gon passed over his stomach. He crawled
three-quarters of a mile over ploughed
ground to reach a neighbor; and it was four
and a half hours after the accident before
he arrived at Melbourne Hospital. In spite

of his sufferings he had still cheerfulness
enough left to say to his brother as he was
carried into the ward, “So long, Bill; keep
smiling.” He is a badly-hurt man, but the
doctors have hopes of pulling him through.
Cheerfulness in a patient is a medical man’s
best asset.

“Feng-Shui”: Strike-breakers in China
have their trials, too. The trams of the
International Settlement in Shanghai run
in some places within a few feet of
the boundary of China proper, and a
resolute shove on the part of an agitator
will propel a loyalist driver or conductor
clean out of foreign territory into his own
country. Six officials of the Shanghai Tram-
way Co. have been caught napping in this
way, while an additional 18 have been kid-
napped from their homes. When released
through representations of the Settlement
police they were found to be in a pitiable
condition. Some were unable to raise their
arms, having been suspended by their com-
patriots by the thumbs. Others had had
their flesh horribly lacerated by methods at
which the Chinese torturer has had a long
experience. Stolid loyalty is a Chinese char-
acteristic, and, in spite of being shot at
and having corrosive acid flung at them, the
servants of the mainly British company still
carry on.
“Simon”: John T. Conover, the only
American on the directorate of George A.
Bond’s beside Bond himself, was on the way
to the firm’s big cotton spinnery at Went-
worthville (N.S.W.) when he gave a swag-
man a lift. The roads over the last four
miles were badly cut up by the lorries that
had transported the heavy machinery. The
bounding back-springs one moment had the
swaggie’s head rammed in the hood canvas,
the next he was nursing his swag on the
floor. Then the lid of the billy flew off
and hit something. The man at the wheel
presently fancied he’d dropped his passen-
ger. Just as he thought of going back the
sundowner untangled himself from under the
dickie seats. “Stranger,” said Conover,
“you’re moving round a hull lot.” “A hull
lot!” gasped the swaggie. “Blime, I should
think so! Did y’ think I was the blanky
Statelier of Liberty?”
* * * *
“Wallaby”: Roll-calls in France were not
always conducted with parade-ground strict-
ness. Such explanations of a Digger’s
absence as “Drowned in a dixie” and “Swal-
lowed a rum-jar” were tolerated to a degree,
for they broke the monotony. The most
appropriate explanation I ever heard was
during our spell on the Somme, when pay-
days had been irregular. To my bald inquiry
for “Private Brown” came the swift answer,
pregnant with meaning: “Filed ’ees
schedule!”
“Herodot”: The most unusual marriage
I’ve had anything to do with was solemnised
when the bridegroom ivas within a day or
two of being executed for a murder. It
happened in Westralia, and the scene of the
ceremony was the office of the governor of
the prison in which the hanging presently
took place. The bride had been the mistress
of the condemned man, and it was in order
that her child might be born legitimate time
the wedding was permitted. The chaplain
performed the ceremony, and officials were
the witnesses. As soon as the ceremony was
over the husband was hurried back to his
cell, while his wife, who never saw him
again, went to the hospital. This is the
only occasion on which a marriage has been
celebrated in such circumstances in Aus-
tralia ; but in England there have been a
number of them, one not very long ago. And
once a man under sentence of death was
allowed to marry a woman to whom he had
merely been engaged, no considerations of
the legitimacy of an infant entering into
the matter.

“Ex-R.N.”: 11.M.5. Cornwall's achieve-
ment in getting into Kiel harbor in a fog
(B. 3/9/’25) does not, I think, compare witli
a trip we had in the London in 1907. Home-
ward bound from the Mediterranean, we
saw Ushant Light (N.-W. France) and then
ran into a pea-soup Channel fog. through
which we saw and heard nothing till we
anchored off the Tongue Lightship at the
Thames entrance, having passed through the
Downs,- between Kent and the Goodwin
Sands, on the way. One Marclmnt Penfold,
whose son is on Sir Dudley de Chair’s staff,
was our navigator, and I was his assistant.
The secret lay in the irregularity of the.
English Channel soundings. With two
Thompson’s electric sounding machines tak-
ing the depth at one-minute intervals, and
with the results platted on tracing paper
to the scale of the chart, it becomes a simple
matter to find the line on the chart whose
soundings coincide w T ith those on the super-
imposed tracing-paper. It is always a mar-
vel to the R.N. man why liners and other
craft are made to take pilots in the English
Channel where the navigation is considerably
easier than walking along a Pitt-street pave-
ment.

“Mr. Squeers”: Chief-Inspector McLel-
land, who retires from the N.S.W. Educa-
tion Department to-day (September 10), met,
many years ago, the last of the hedge school-
masters —men without training whom the old
National Board had been glad to get for bush
schools. In his callow days as an inspector
he visited the South Coast school where Mr.
Denis O’Brien was giving third class (four
boys on a bench) an object-lesson on the
tiger. "Phwat kind of horses,” inquired
Dinny, “do they hunt the tiger with?” “Big
ones,” answered the children. “Oye, but
phwat sort—come now, you know, the ones

with thrunks?” The-' youngsters sparkled.
Elephants!” they exclaimed to their
teacher’s beaming approval. Suppressing a
laugh, the inspector advised the teacher to
refrain from asking leading questions. “Very
well, thin,” said Dinny; “if tigers were mag-
nified as shmall as cats, phwat would be the
difference betune them?” “None,” was the
ready yell. At another school in the Casino
district a scripture lesson on the Garden of
Eden was in progress. The youngsters were
interested in the serpent, as they knew some-
thing about snakes. The inspector took a
hand. “How did the Devil get into the
Garden?” he inquired. “Through a crack
in the fence,” thought one boy. “But think
now,” said the inspector; “the Devil was in
the form of a serpent. He must have been
a pretty big fellow to get through a crack,
don’t you think?” “He’d get in all right!”
said the youngster. “Adam didn’t bother
to ’ave his palin’s too close; there was no
boys in them days to steal his quinces!”
THE LAST WORD IN PANTS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The world is singularly small,
There’s little happens new.
I still can vividly recall
f (So, in my place, would you)
The sudden shock I got therein
When first I saw a larrikin
’Way back in ’ninety-two.
It wasn’t in nocturnal fray
Nor was he out for gore:
He stood upon the Queen’s highway
Near where I’d come ashore.
It wasn’t what he’d done or might
That gave me momentary fright,
’Twas simply what he wore.
For I was fresh from Shepherd’s Bush,
New-weaned from Oxford’s breast.
We’d heard grim tales about the push
That stoushes cops with zest,
Much of the fearsome deeds they did;
But what was previously hid
From me was how they dressed.
A generation’s rippled on,
Some thirty years and three;
And once again, a week agone,
I stood beside the Quay
To get a worse sartorial knock
Than that which gave me such a shock
When fresh from oversea.
A youth in what there was no doubt
He reckoned gladsome rags!
They flapped like loosened sails about
His shins, or waving flags.
It gaped in wonderment, the crowd,
Till someone hazarded aloud,
“What price the Oxford bags ?”
\
The curious swarmed on every side,
He scarce could swish him through.
Pert flappers gazed spellbound, pip-eyed,
Tough lumpers whistled “Ph-e-e-e-w.”
And I—l felt the same within
As when I saw the larrikin
(My first) in ’ninety-two.
The world is ludicrously small
And oft extremes abut;
It gives a man to think withal,
It furnishes a nut
To crack. Ah me!—to think that I
Should five to see the Oxford High
Out-freak the Argyle Out!

Although premium income has fallen off

tSan Francisco disaster.
The co.’s loss rate is always rather high;
but its operations are so extensive, and so
much business now comes to it automatically,
that its expense rate is low. East year luck
and good management conspired to reduce
both rates; and a clip of even 2 p.c. on either
account means over £20,000 more profit.
Further, the co. is in the happy position of
being able to put all such plums by and still
(thanks to its youthful moderation in the
matter of capitalisation) pay a juicy divi-
dend. Reserves are, therefore, so large that
interest and rents brought in £111,597 —all
but £7153 of the amount necessary for the
13.2 p.c. div. Assets, moreover, are of the
best type, almost two millions being in
public securities and cash. But here are
balance-sheet figures, with a pre-war com-
parison :
1914. 1924. 1925.
Paid capital .. .. £450,000 £900,000 £900,000
Liabilities .. .. 252,929 434,919 445,043
Public securities .. 521,979 1,648,135 1,739,125
Mortgages .. .. 195,409 18.717 18,550
Shares, etc. .. .. 395 478 671
Freeholds .. .. 349,457 382,599 385,478
Agency balances and cash 240,249 452,310 499,369
The reserves, by the way, consist, of: —
Reserve fund .. .. £525,000
Reserve for unexpired risks 536,500
Investment fluctuation and
contingencies .. .. 19,565
P. and L. balance .. . . 124,585
In addition £30,000 is held in taxation re-
serve, all of which is probably true profit;
and it is possible that some is hidden in the
£228,454 appropriation for unascertained
losses.
From the policy-holder’s viewpoint things
are very solid. The reserve for unexpired
risks was £107,396 more than the customary
40 p.c. demands, while total funds
(£2,105,650) were equal to almost twice last
year’s net premium income. Ordinarily 150
p.c. is considered adequate. The amount
was in excess of total losses for the past
three years. The only thing that share-
holders have to worry about is the date
of the next bonus issue. Old holders have
of late years fared richly, and even those who
bought on the open market 10 years ago at
100 p.c. premium are getting the full value
of the 13.2 p.c. div., with further pickings
certain. And every £ of capital, allowing
40 p.c. as sufficient backing for unexpired
risks, was covered by assets, chiefly cash and
gilt-edged stock, worth 375. 3d. There are
the inner reserves as additional comfort to
shareholders, and £600,000 of capital un-
called to still further impress policy-holders.
The eo.’s trustee business continues to
progress. Only a bare statement is pub-
lished. During the year the total moved
up by £548,040 to £3,988,614. Earnings are

Like other pastoral-finance and agency cos.
Pitt, Son and Badgery had a fat year. Ke-
cord profits were disclosed, and shareholders
got a bonus of £20,000 in shares worth a
lot more than that. In six out of the last
seven years such gifts have been handed out,
the amount ranging from £lO,OOO to £20,000.
In fact, it has become almost a habit; and,
as the experiences of Sydney Telegraph and
Sydney Ferries show, it is a habit that is
liable to get investors into serious trouble if
they are not careful. With wool prices
likely to hold at profitable levels, P., S. and
B. may no doubt continue the process some
distance yet. But it ought to be noted that
reserves, although healthy at £79,033, grow
steadily less in relation to capital. In the
five years 1914-19 reserves, after providing
divs. and bonus, grew by £25,304. In the
past five years the growth has been only
£13,915. There is a suggestion here that
the recent pace cannot be safely maintained
much longer. That it has been maintained
so long is a tribute both to the pastoral in-
dustry of Australia and to the people who
run this business.
Big changes are in balance-sheet
figures, suggesting that circumstances have
almost compelled the directors to modify the
policy which they so long pursued :

Suspension of sales following the collapse
in wool prices was responsible: and as the
market has re-opened at good rates the
finances should soon be got back to some-
thing like their old complexion. At the end
of June 19,022 bales awaited sale as com-
pared with 1166 bales of carryover for the
previous year; and yet (so wonderfiil were
the prices) there was a turnover of £4,592 BocS
compared with £3,922,444 for 1924. Other
departments “showed steady progress ; the
co. has a big voice in the fat-stock market,
and there as elsewhere the outlook is quite
cheery.

1925.. 10,269 10 p.c. = 12,500 22,350
The call of the tax collector amazed the
directors;—
The assessment for this amount came as a great
surprise, as all previous demands in connection with
the war-time profits tax had been paid years ago
and the matter was considered as having been finalised.
This has been paid under protest, and efforts are
now being made to obtain a refund.
Meantime a big bite has been taken out of
the rather poor reserves, which are now
smaller than they had been since 1917.
That they were further drawn on to per mix
of the 10 p.c. div. is a far from reassuring
feature of the year’s operations. Certainly
there is something to be said in extenua-
tion. During the term two modern concrete
buildings were erected in a rising part of
the city, one of 12 floors used as office and
warehouse, the other of seven floors used as
factory, bulk and bonded stores; and this
meant temporarily unproductive capital nlus
certain removal exes. Moreover prices have
been affected by severe competition, and that
played a big part. The management states
that, in spite of drawbacks, turnover in-
creased, and the maintenance of the 10 p.c.
div. rate may be taken as expressing a
favorable opinion of prospects. But the
published figures are not so cheering. In
the preceding four years the aggregate divi-
dends exceeded the aggregate profits; and,
seeing that the reserves were rather poor,
anyway, that isn’t the sort of thing to make
the investor want to rush this stock.
Balance-sheet figures compare thus: —
1914. 1923. 1924. 1925.
Capital .. £75,000 £125,000 £125,000 £125,000
Liabilities .. 49,570 62,029 123,905 210,090

Cash and invest-
ments . . 2,931 6,205 4,108 1,257
Liabilities were greater by £86,185. Free-
hold, plant and fixtures were in the books
at £174.051 —an increase of £78,267 on the
1924 figure. To what extent the co.’s bank-
ers were asked to assist was not stated, but
it may safely be assumed that the over-
draft grew lustily. Besides the co.’s big cen-
tral premises, “Australia House,” the item
was increased by additions to plant. Six
floors of the new premises have been leased
at rentals which “practically cover all in-
terest charges and upkeep on the whole
building.” That, at least, is satisfactory,
considering the way letting space has
dragged in some portions of the city. The
current term will be free from the troubles
resulting from the removal, and the rental
from Australia House will benefit accounts
over the whole term. The result should
show in improved profits. And improvement
will be necessary if 10 p.c. divs. are to con-
tinue.

“Keen competition” is quoted as the reason
for that thud in profits. “Keen” is a mild
term. In addition to competition from well-
known imported music machines and from
local makes, including the output of one-
man factories, there was the spread of
listening-in. And over all was the financial
stringency which found rapid reflection in
the luxury trades. Listening-in has affected
the sale of music-boxes all over the place.
That, of course, represents a setback to only
one branch of the business, but there is no
sign of diminishing interest in the new craze;
on the contrary, broadcasting is becoming
an integral part of social life. The co. has
taken prompt steps to adapt its business to
the new circumstances. A department has
been established to handle wireless; and
there has been reorganisation of production
to meet the competition of cheap machines,
and to cope with the general downward ten-
dency in prices, which still continues. Mean-
time the playing of billiards, pool and snooker
has not ceased, nor has the dance-mad
flapper given her jazz records a long sleep.
So the management reports a recovery, one
w r ay and another, since the close of the
accounts, figures for the first three months
of the current term indicating a greater
turnovei*.
Changes in balance-sheet figures in the
year were unimportant:—

The books were closed a fortnight earlier
than in previous years, which did not im-
prove the profit figure. Divs. on the pref.
shares absorbed £16.000, and reserves were
drawn on for the difference, plus £OOdd tor
taxation provision; in all, £9OOB. Despite
the comparatively poor return, the Board
wiped off the books £1775 flotation exes., and
clipped £407 off establishment account, but
added £76 to goodwill—a net reduction of
£2106 on the year. Quarterly payment of
pref. divs. is to be discontinued, and there
is to be a half-yearly balance. The co.’s
interest in Pathe Baby Films (it controls
the Australian co.) has thus far proved un-
profitable, and a visit to the manufacturers
was necessary. This year the expensive sub-
sidiary is expected to prove a help instead of
a drag.

The co. has by no means had the opulent
experience suggested by the div. figures in
that table. Between 1906 and where that
table starts half of the capital was written
off. and for eight years divs. averaged little
more than 1 p.c. And now the later pros-
perity has broken. Inadequate tariff ex-
plains it. Wages have gone on climbing, and
the shortened working week won’t help the
management to meet the competition from
low-wage foreign countries and the thinly-
disguised dumping from overseas. Further,
the high price of wool has lately been a
hindrance, conditions preventing the man-
agement from putting up prices proportion-
ately. Sales certainly were a bit better
than in the previous year; but they were
over £20.000 less than in 1920, when materials
and manufacturing exes, cost practically no
more: — , ,

in it for shareholders until the Big Aus-

It was in No. 1 mine that the disastrous
explosion occurred on September 1, 1923.
For 17 months the tunnel was closed. On
January 30 last the mine was declared clear
and a few weeks later coal was being hauled.
Since then production has steadily increased.
No. 2 mine has been further opened up, and
when normal output from No. 1 is reached
earnings will move upward. During the
year the plant was reconditioned: a large
number of new skips and hopper waggons
were built, and a new haulage plant
was installed. Thus the co. is in a
position to meet the increased de-
mand that it anticipates. Although coal
was won from No. 1 only 41 months of the
term (No. 2 worked as usual), trade was
satisfactory. On that point there is little
need for anxiety, for the quality of Bellbird
coal will win it a market. Meantime there
is comfort to shareholders in the directors’
assurance that “the property is again in such
a position as to give reasonably good re-
turns.” Investors will, however, note that
the co. is rather heavily capitalised.
Balance-sheet figures were affected by the
stoppage and the cost of bringing back the
tunnel to working condition

From Manxman (W.A.): Radio isi pro-
ceeding with main-shaft sinking from 8 .
to 280 ft., and, as the shaft is being deep-
ened between two quartz veins, each about
loin, wide, no values are reported, bhare-
holders are pinning their faith to the east
crosscut from the 280 ft. level, which th y
hope will expose the eastern reef good and
wide. Meanwhile, there is little to be cheery
about. Jensen, an Adelaide engineer, has
just completed an investigation ami
of the property. The first payment (£o900)
on account of purchase price (£4o,uuO) is
nearly due. A call of Is. has been made
a development unappreciated by sharehold-
ers. In the event of £5OOO being paid over,
28,000 call-paid shares will be issued to the
Radio Syndicate at 3s. apiece, but it is
thought here that most of these shares have
already been unloaded on the public at prices
ranging from ss. to 9s. a share.. ... Hansel
Mundy Co., having struck poor values in its
first bore on Radio Deeps, is now looking
forward to better results from the second,
which should reach the required depth about
t he middle of the month.... Neither the
Telfer North Co. on Radio North nor the
Radio South Co. on Radio South had any
luck with prospecting. The former has
given up, and the latter is thinking of it.

Brown’s Reward (W.A.) claims to have
something good on its Field's Find show.
Mining men who have been there say that
a fairly large tonnage of ore is available
above 100 ft., which is estimated to average
an oz. per ton over the plates. Opinions
are divided, however, as to whether it is
likely to live down. The Board recently re-
fused to give Dorrio Doolettc an option on
the 110.000 unissued shares at Is. per share.
* * . •* *
Freney’s Board was hauled over the coals
at the recent annual meeting. One share-
holder reckoned that the present method of
boring was unsatisfactory; another declared
that working costs were too high. Chairman
Nicholson and director Learmouth admitted
that latterly operations had not proceeded
as well as expected, but with the assistance
of an expert driller the Board hoped for
better things.
* * * *
Cole’s Find (W.A.) is elbowing its way
to the front as a small but good gold-produc-
ing centre. Reefs, although narrow, are well
over ounce grade, and several first-rate re-
turns have lately been obtained by prospec-
tors working them. The field is near Wiluna,
and forms part of a big belt of mostly
untested country.
* * * *
Attorney Vail has been blowing off about
the prospects of the London syndicate which,
holds options on the Wiluna mines (W.A,).
He says (1) that values recently exposed
at 300 ft. will return a very handsome profit,
and (2) that after further development the
property will easily provide from 40,000 to
50.000 tons a month for treatment. Vail
naively adds that he wishes to “avoid any
tendency to boom”; all the same, his mild
boost has caused the market to move? up.

Since Tom Birkbeck went west to give
Dorrie Doolette’s Kanowna Red Hill a fresh
trial, that ancient show lias turned up trumps.
It had taken a lot of stoping round the No.
1 main fault to show that if the tributors
were not to come in something heroic would
have to be done, as No. 3 shaft stone had
cut out. The forlorn hope was to prospect
back below. No. 2 fault in the No. 4 sec-
tion. This attack ended in rich gold being
got underfoot in a patch of leaders, 30ft.
west of former workings. The stone so
sweetened up a crushing of 420 tons that it
nearly touched the ounce-mark. Then an-
other winze sunk only 30ft. away for fear
that the shoots would pinch out still bettered
yields and shed a welcome div. Hence,
having measured up the trend of the runs ot
stone, manager J. James feels that he can
unearth other little bonanzas. But Red Hill
at best is a slippery place in which to build
castles.

Recent explorations at Broken Hill, even
at the old B. 11. Prop., have largely in-
creased reserves and “probable ore ; and,
given even a fairly favorable metal market,
the end of things has been pushed far
into the future. Meantime metal prices ’are
so good that all hands at the mines are
enjoying a bonus reaching well towards a
pound a week.
* * * *
Nobody knows yet what (if any) good
it will do Broken Hill; but the direct rail-
way from Sydney via Condobolin is being
pushed along" rapidly, and there are now only
50 miles of rails to lay—the line is open to
within 90 miles of Menindie, which already
has its connection with the Hill* The
Darling, however, remains to be bridged:
but that considerable job will not be started
until the line is ready to carry the material
to the river from the Sydney side.

Flagstone Tin (N.S.W.) is nearing 100 ft.
into the hillside in its eastern tunnel, and
the poorer values met at 73ft. are still there.
The circumstance prompts engineer E. P.
Johnson to remark that the values have
dipped underfoot, as usual with tin . lodes;
actually what most often happens with tin
lodes is that the values don’t dip anywhere
—they disappear almost as suddenly as they
appear. The Butler battery and plant should
be in going order this year, when the real
test of recoverable values iu bulk will be
determined.
* * * *
Manager Lawry, of Lucknow Pups
(N.S.W.), is sanguine that the present
“joint” development in progress is what he
has been looking for —diorite, carrying horn-
blende, and making fast to the serpentine. It
has cut out No. 5 vein, and has almost de-
posed the intrusive stuff in the “joint” chan-
nel. Any veins coming in with the diorite
at this stage may give a rich pocket. Share-
holders have stuck it well, and nobody would
begrudge McFadzean and co. a term amongst
the ins.
-* * * *
Vegetable Creek. Ardlethan (N.S.W.), be-
lieves that its western prospecting drive has
picked up a new ore body 16ft. from the end
of the main western pipe. The drive opened
out into ore “going 13 p.c. tin” across
feet, and after four feet of driving it was
still O.K. Shares moved f-om Is. 6d. to
3s. 6d.

A long story is told by the Australian
Shale Oil crowd to explain just why they
left Murrurundi (N.S.W.)— temporarily—
for the Speck. The gist of the yarn is
that 10,000 Tasmanian acres, supposed to
contain 10,000,000 tons of shale, looked to
be the bigger pot. Already boring has been
done on 300 acres, and the engineers kgure
out 2.000.000 tons of shale in the block.
That is a sweet pippin to offer an absorbent
market. Moreover, there are other titbits
to tickle the speculative palate. No rent
has to be put up for five years on the block
bored, aud then the co. can go ahead to get
the whole 10,000 acres into a compact unit,
if it has the necessary energy and capital.
So, with the railway alongside, the shale
present, oil in demand and the Brondcr
retort under construction, things look pro-
mising. There is quite a vocabulary of con-
templated products. They start with ben-
zine and end with synthetic asphalt. The
Board still clings to the Murrurundi pro-
perty, which is to have its chance when the
Speck’s retort drips benzine, motor-spirit,
oil, tar and skip-grease in uninterrupted
sequence.

Urgent requests for the services, of State
Government Geologist Reid sent him to the
Tasmanian north-west coast to examine a
new silver-lead show. Government assays
disclosed silver contents varying from 180 oz.
to 2300 z.. with over 60 p.c. lead. The pro-
perty is situated on the seashore near Pen-
guin, which w r as once known as a silver-lead
field, but has not been worked for years. But
nothing has been made known as to probable
tonnages.
* * * *
Good news comes from B,allarat concern-
ing a search for the famous Indicator line
which always led to payable quartz veins in
the old days. McLennan and Reid have
succeeded in finding the Indicator north of
the old Canton mine at 40ft. in a vertical
formation up to liin. thick. The quartz
veins associated are 20ft. wide and average
Ift. thick. The stone has returned 7dwt. to
the ton. In Ballarat the Indicators are dis-
tinct beds of slate or shale having a direct
influence on the contents of the reefs cross-
ing them. In the New Normanby mine at
Ballarat East the Indicator was and is
a narrow bed of dark-colored slate, which
has been traced for a distance of eight miles
and was worked from the surface to 1600 ft.
Nuggets up to 21950 z. have been found near
by. In all the Ballarat East mines rich
patches occurred where the flat quartz veins
or floors intersected thin vertical lines of
dark-colored slate. Away from the Indica-
tor the quartz is barren, but at the. intersec-
tion large masses of gold were obtained.
* * * *
To average ounce gold for six months and
not to make a profit is not satisfactory, but
that is the luck of the Rose. Thistle and
Shamrock, Bendigo. The trouble is that the
shoots of ore are short, and it is a hard job
to get a new level opened up without call-
making. As the new level is 280 ft. below 7
No. 1 it may, howmver, give enough backs to
keep the stamps falling continuously until
there conies the color of a div. or two. To
get ahead of the mill another lift is being
sunk. The programme is the only one if
the management does not want to run the
show merely to give the miner a job.
The railway strike in Queensland cut off
Mt. Morgan’s fuel supplies, and work
stopped on August 28. Before they start
things again the directors want to have a
talk to Premier Gillies about the serious
loss with which the co. is faced.
* * * *
“Nothing Matters,” from his angle:—
This deponent has been hammering away for 16
years by written and spoken word to persuade the
Commonwealth Government to do two things to help
the quest for petroleum: First, to withdraw the
promised bonus of £50,000 oh the first oil produced,
and to substitute a subsidy of that amount on the
£ for £ basis to oil-prospecting companies; and,
second, to begin the complete geological survey of
this continent. The first essential to the finding of
petroleum in Australia is to survey likely petroli-
ferous areas geologically and make plans for the
use of the prospector. This country is too big for
the gambler’s process of blind stabbing to succeed.
Even elementary geological knowledge is necessary
to help the oil prospector, so that he will not, for
instance, bore in granite, or drill down into a
syncline in the hope of striking oil. Ur. Wade
having endorsed the above policy after making flying
reconnaisances of the six States, the Federal Govern-
ment has accepted his recommendations and £50,000
has been allocated to subsidise boring at three places:
Bedford Dome, Hunter River district (N.S.W.);
Price’s Creek, Fitzroy River district (W.A.) ; and
in the vicinity of Longreach, Blackall and Ruthven
(Q.), where two test bores have been drilled. The
Ministry declines to tell why Dr. Made does not
recommend boring in South Aus., Vic. and
Tas., and it seems grossly unfair to withhold the
information. Recently he spent three days on the
Caroline-Nelson field, south-east of Mount Gambier
(S.A.), where oil has been found in small quantities
in three holes by two companies. There is no geo-
logical map in existence of that district, nor is there
of the Price’s Creek and Blackall territories. Dr.
Wade was asked to go to the Lakes district, Gipps-
land (Vie.), to make a flying survey of ground where
the tertiary rocks are believed by the Victorian
Mines Department to be between 3000 and 4000 feet
thick. Let us hope that the Federal Treasurer will
next year allocate £50,000 or more for scout-boiing
in Vie., S.A. and Tasmania.
* * * *
Of the Australian oil shows interest centres
in the Lander Co.’s. The latest mishap, the
jambing of the reamer in No. 1 bore, is a
difficulty which the drill is expected to over-
come. The incident has revived the discus-
sion as to the moral hazard in the search tor
oil in Australia. S. Aus. Oil Wells is plug-
giug away at its No. 2 bore; No. 1 has been
muddled up and left for the time being. A
co. is to be floated to handle the Belford
Dome proposition, Hunter River (N.S.W.),
which received a favorable mention for Com-
monwealth subsidy. At present and for
some considerable time a syndicate has
been investigating and mapping the area.
The Taranaki (M.L.) Co. is quiet after the
recent flutter. Tarata bore was dowu to
3060 ft. in sandy shale at latest, with the
81in. casing to 3020 ft. Moturoa bore was
at 1900 ft. and good shows of oil and gas
were reported. Hope is being built on the
reported similarity of the gas to that of the
Mexican Juan Casiano No. 7 well. In the
latter case the well flowed 25,000' barrels a day
for seven years and was still a good producer.
* * * *
Malaya Tin Corporation has deferred its
liquidation pending further particulars from
Siam regarding borings in a new area. A
circular told shareholders that “W. J. L.
Smith, a representative of the co. in Siam,
has by letter confirmed his cable that he has
secured and partly sampled what appears to
the Board to be the best tin proposition yet
offered the corporation.” This is very vague:
surely there were some figures in Laybourne
Smith’s letter. Pitt-street has, of course,
been talking, whispering about 131 b. to the
yard and discussing whether the bonanza is
a pocket or something outsize. But there
may be nothing at all in that.
* * * *
Nawng Pet (F.M.S.) got only a fraction
over seven tons oxide for August, the pro-
duct fetching £ll3O and costing £567 to get
out. On a share register of 500,000 a
month’s profit of £5OO or less looks small
potatoes, especially as nothing is said about
“cleaning up faces” on this occasion. In
the circumstances shares do well to hold
about 3s. 6d.
* * * *
“Blazer”: What is this talk of Kuala
Lumpur picking up a 17oz. black-tin show?
Only a limited lot of bores have been put
down, and there is plenty of room between
for blanks or bonanzas. If the price is to
be £70,000, as is told, and another £50,000
or more has to be found for dredges, it is
a simple matter to work out how long it will
take to get back capital plus interest from
the show. In any case there is no need to
rush a market weakened as a result of the
troubles of the suction-cutter shows. Job-
bers want Singapore to learn that it isn’t
good form to boost stocks before news is
through to the Room.

A breakdown of the engine driving the
ventilating plant interrupted work at the
New Guinea Copper Co.’s Dubuna mine.
On resumption it was found that tlie fire
had spread, preventing access to the main
stopes. The management sealed the work-
ings, and reported that it would probably
be a month before ore production would be
resumed. Meantime the furnace had been
giving trouble, so that the retrcatmeut of
low-grade matte was interfered with. Sur-
plus labor has been diverted to the Laloki.
* * * *
Mandated Development reports promising
developments in No. 2 bore at Matapau,
where, at GOOft,, gas and oil are reported.
E. A. Briggs, the co.'s consulting geologist,
is impressed, and drilling was held up pend-
ing the arrival of the driller, Boss, who was
expected to reach the field on September 10.
Timor Petroleum reports “heavy oil and gas
issuing between Sin. and lOin. casing at the
main rig.” All of which is comforting to
shareholders, although the market isn’t
wildly excited in either case.

Two members of the Empire Press people
visiting Australia have family associations
with Maoriland. Alan P. Herbert (“A.P.11.”
of London Punch) is a member of the
Selwyn family. Ilis grandfather was a
brother of the distinguished Bishop Selwyn.
“A.P.H.” served at Gallipoli in the same
zone as the Maorilanders. And Captain
Anthony Eden, of the Yorkshire Post, be-
longs to the family of which Lord Auckland
is the head. It was Governor Hobson who
named the Queen City after Lord Auckland,
who was First Lord of the Admiralty when
the Gov. was appointed. The point whence
the city is shown to visitors is named Mount
Eden; and Captain Eden was taken up to
see it.
A hundred leading articles unavoidably
denied publication owing to the exigencies
of travel struggled for precedence on the
eloquent lips of David Davies, the little
Lloyd Georgian editor of the South Wales
Daily Post, when he got up in Sydney
’Varsity Great Hall to give thanks on behalf
of the British newspaper visitors at the
academic reception the other day. Nearly
40 minutes ticked from the big clock before
he sat down, and even the undergraduate
clapping from the rear, which had a sly
meaning to the initiated, did not prevent him
saying all he had to say. The centre of
gravity of the “delegation,” the large and
sombre-hued representative of the smallest
dominion, Prof. Augusto Bartolo of Malta,
then lifted his floodgates, and the billy had
boiled for over half an hour before he
finished.
A. G. Proudfoot, president of Nunawading
(Box Hill), a Collins-street lawyer, is the
most outstanding of the new bunch of
Senator HANNAN,
Federal Presi-
dent of the Austra-
lian party, who

Sydney to convey

Laborites about the
seamen’s strike.
mayors and pre-
sidents of Greater
Melbourne. He was
chief president of
the A.N.A. in 1908-
09, and he might
have gone in for
politics then had
liis legal business
not called with a
m ore seductive
voice.
Herbert Welliam, one of the visiting press-
men, is editor of the Penang Straits Echo,
and comes from an enchanting tropical island
which has associations for Australians. It
was purloined from a handful of Malay
fishermen, nominally under Siamese mis-
rule, by William Light, father of the Col.
Light who planned the stately thoroughfares
of Adelaide. The father’s method of settle-
ment was not as academic as the son’s. He
filled a cannon with silver dollars, it is
alleged, and fired them into the jungle. The
process of looking for the dol'lars cleared
the island, and judging by the present condi-
tion of the thriving city, the Chinese found
most of them. Light is generally supposed to
have married a half-caste Portuguese lady,
but if he did there is no sign of any mixture
in the portraits of his son or in the statue
that graces King William-street, Adelaide.
The newly appointed organising secretary
of the Vic. Labor party, John Kean, comes
fresh from editing and managing the Bal-
larat Echo. He has had a big experience of
Labor campaigning, mostly in and around
Ballarat: and when Hugh Mahon contested
lvalgoorlie after his expulsion from Parlia-
ment in 1920, Kean was specially sent over
to help, a tribute to his organising ability.
Twenty-five years ago he had a reputation
as a road-racing cyclist.
Maui Pomare, Minister for Health in the
M.L. Cabinet, who suggested the other day
that the new Opposition leader should be
christened “Snivelling George,” is a son of
Wiremu Naera Pomare, chief of the Ngati-
awa. The Ngatiawa was the tribe that, to
escape being eaten by Te Rauparalia,
emigrated in 1835 to Pt. Nicholson, where
Wellington now stands. There it met some
of the Moriori race, from the Chathams, and
their plump condition suggested to the
Ngatiawa the project of occupying the
islands and living on their inhabitants.
They seized an English vessel, the Rodney,
lying in the fairway, and sailed to these
pastures new, where their hopes were abun-
dantly realised. It is alleged they assimilated
in a literal fashion a large proportion of
the population, which amounted to several
thousand souls —and bodies. Wiremu’s dis-
tinguished descendant, who now represents
the Western Maori in Parliament, was
brought to order by indignant pakelias. With
characteristic grace he remarked that he
had attributed snivelling to the hon. member
purely in the political sense.
COL. F. T. KINDON, military member of
the Deportation Board, now sitting in
Sydney.
Colonel Fred Kindon, of the Deportation
Hoard, went to S’Africa as a private in the
Westralian Goldfield Infantry Regiment. In
the Great War he was second in command
of the Ist Battalion, and left an eye behind
at Done Pine. He is 55, and for the first
dozen years of his life was an Englishman.
“Burrawong”: Newly come to the Araluen
(N.S.W.) district and supervising the build-
ing of a temporary home is Mrs. .Tack Lon-
don, widow of the famous writer. Her house
is situated at Blatchford’s, on the tip-top of
the Araluen mountain, between Braidwood
and Araluen. There is much secrecy sur-
rounding the business, and picnic-parties to
the mountain-top have been vigorously shooed
off. The local authority says the place is
being built to win health for one of the ladies
—there arc three of them: Mrs. Jack,
“Granny” London and another.
Dead in Adelaide at 34 Dr. Rennie. Adel-
aide's front-rank T.B. specialist. Landing in
England a week before the outbreak of war.
he supplemented his good Adelaide degrees
with the M.R.C.S. (Lond.j. Then followed
service in France with the R.A.M.C., which
ended late in 1916, when he was invalided
home as a T.B. case. Making a good recov-
ery, he was appointed medical officer in
charge of the Bedford Park Sanatorium,
where he worked night and day in the in-
terests of stricken fellow-Diggers. In 1919
he re-opened Nunyara Sanatorium in the
Adelaide hills, where he waged a relentless
warfare on T.B. in the interests of the
general public. His. heavy work soon told
its tale, and once more he went down to the
enemy. For the past three years he fought
a gallant but losing fight against the deadly
germ, and with almost his last breath he
denounced the Government scheme for spend-
ing over £50,000 on the erection of a T.B.
sanatorium at Bedford Park —a place in his
opinion totally unsuited for the purpose. He
was a son of Professor Rennie and a grand-
son therefore of that fine old straigbtgoer
who for many years was Auditor-General of
N. S. Wales.
J. A. Safe is the new president of the
Victorian Victuallers; he just, managed to
beat E. J. Woods, who has been Chief Bung
for 10 years. Safe, who rules Young and
Jackson’s, the hotel with the unique picture
gallery—the collection is insured for £14,000
—is a good Australian in a trade wherein
good Australians are not conspicuously
numerous. When the campaign to push Aus-
tralian whisky under its own name was
begun lie was one of the first to give the
local product a fair run.
“T.P.”: Labor showed a poor spirit in not
being officially represented at the grave of
W. A. Trenwith, the man who bore the
brunt of the fight when it wasn’t fashionable
to wear the Labor tag. He was a slashing
debater as a young fellow, and ready in more
ways than one. I remember him taking
part in a debate, with Monty Miller as chair-
man. His opponent remarked: “Trenwith,
you are a sanguinary liar.” Out shot Bill’s
fist, and the man went down. “I apologise
to you, Mr. Chairman,” said Trenwith, “but
not to that object, whom I’ll fight in any
British way he chooses.” “Under the cir-
cumstances, I accept the apology,” drawled
Monty; “but pray remember that as chair-
man I demand the privilege of maintaining
order. After this slight digression the de-
bate will proceed.”
Australia has an interest in the big deal
which has resulted in the absorption of the
Austin Company, British motor-makers, by
the General Motors Corporation of America.
Sir Herbert Austin, who founded the Eng-
lish firm, learnt his trade in Langland's
foundry, South Melbourne; and a S. Aus.
Digger named Waite, who was an engineer-
ing apprentice when he enlisted, met Austin’s
daughter whilst convalescing in England,
married her, and entered the Austin Co.
Austin was a smart apprentice, and when
Langland’s began making parts for the
Wolseley sheep-shearing machine he was
placed in charge of that work. The Wolseley
Co. showed its appreciation by appointing
him Australian manager. He was trans-
ferred to the English works in 1890, 10 years
later became a director, and started his own
firm 19 years ago.
At least one officer of the American Fleet
will return to Maoriland to settle down. This
is Chief-Quartermaster Richard Begbie, of
the Pennsylvania, who was born in the Wai-
kato and has revisited his homeland after 85
years’ absence. He was amazed to note the
progress of the country, and decided it was
an ideal spot in which to spend his leisure
years when he retires on pension shortly.
Another intending settler is a young mechanic
interested in dairying, who has bought a
farm at Drury, near Auckland, where he
intends to instal the latest American milking
machinery. Incidentally, this enthusiast is a
boxer with an Olympic games reputation.
“G.C.T.”: “T.W.W.’s” par. (B. 27/S/’25)
about my father, Fred Trollope, son of
Anthony, is accurate as well as sympathetic,
except in one detail. I, his son, do not recol-
lect any lisp in his speech. The barely per-
ceptible remains of an early difficulty with
his r’s was all that could be called so.
Anthony Trollope, Charles Dickens and
Charles Lever all had sons at Wilcannia in
the early ’eighties. Before becoming a civil
servant and chairman of the Land Board in
the Ilay district, my father owned Mortray
Station at Grenfell, within sight of Ben
Hall’s lair in the Weddin Mountains. Mor-
tray has now disappeared as a station, and
most of the_ land is held by the Priddle
family; William of that clan takes a keen
pleasure in showing visitors the stump of a
tree under which Anthony Trollope used to
sit writing his novels when he was staying
with his son. While still at his station my
father married a daughter of William Far-
rand,. at one time proprietor of the Bathurst
Free Press and other country journals. He
was subsequently a police magistrate at
Forbes and died out at Wentworth.
Dick Hain, who died at Moreland (Vic.)
the other day, set foot on the Inky Way 28
years ago. Tie was Deakin’s shadow for
years, and attached himself to Alfred when
he, as Prinie Minister, visited the Cold
Country twice to attend Imperial confer-
ences. Then he basked for a while in Pea-
cock’s sunshine, and latterly was offsider to
Prohibitionist Greenwood, M.L.A. for Boroon-
dara. The mourners at his funeral included
most of the “knights of the round table”—
a luncheon-party comprising politicians, offi-
cials and city men that used to assemble re-
gularly at the Winter Garden, beneath the
Block Arcade.

The Coopers have long ceased to have any

William Charles Cooper in England has a
point of interest. He was the second son

T. M. Cullinan, of Sale (Vie.), 17 years
a borough and town councillor, lias entered
on his seventh term as mayor. Cullinan is
a native of the town, an orator and a man
of tact. Liast year he conducted the Kack-
to-Sale movement, and after doing tilings
lavishly, handed a profit of £2OO to the hos-
pital. This year he has visions of a new
town hall and a new base hospital, the latter
to cost £20.000.
The habitues of the Melbourne Glaciarium
include A. B. Talbot Simonds, who was 85
last week and is still an enthusiast. He
is the veteran of skating in Melbourne; when
George Coppin opened the Apollo Hall,
Bourke-street, 57 years ago, he was waiting
at the early doors to get in. The old chap
—who doesn’t mind whether he uses edge
or roller skates —was a school-mate in Glou-
cestershire of Dr. W. G. Grace; and it was
the historic Royal Charter that brought him
to Australia 70 years ago,
.Toe Coates, M.L.C., who imparts a cer-
tain amount of hustle to the outside doings
of the N.S.W. Cabinet, though only an
Honorary Minister without salary, was the
first man to indicate that Bathurst could be
won by a Laborite. Getting the party nomi-
nation in 1910, he came within 300 votes of
the sitting member, surveyor .Tack Miller.
At the time Bathurst was suffering from sec-
tarianism and the general grumpiness that
afflicts squatter-locked towns which find them-
selves slipping. That was his only run for
the “Lower” House. Bathurst at the next
election went to Durack, who made a rapid
rise to leadership when Labor split on con-
scription. Before the next election he had
resigned everything and disappeared as sud-
denly as he rose.
“Ancient Mariner”: I could cite a shoal
of authorities, including the late Sir J. K.
Laughton, naval historian and secretary of
naval records, in support of my statement
that Capt. Cook’s youngest son, Hugh-
named after Sir Hugh Palliser —died of
scarlet fever at Cambridge on December 21,
1793, having then ibeen in residence at
Christ’s College for only two months. W. H.
G. Kingston’s slip is, in this particular in-
stance, only a minor one, but it is, unfortu-
nately* the fact that the great navigator's
life-story has been left to be dealt with, in
the main, by parsons, pedagogues, novelists
and women writers who have perpetrated
innumerable blunders, major and minor, in
the handling of their subject. Even in the
recently-published “Discovery of Australia."
by Prof. Arnold Wood, of Sydney Univer-
sity. there is a crude attempt to convert
Cook's ship time into civil time as it is now
observed in Australia; the author makes it
appear that Cook advanced his time by a
full day at the precise moment he sighted
these shores, when, of course, he did nothing
of tile kind. There was no civil time in
Australia in 1770, and, following the uni-
sal practice of navigators of pre-chronometer
days, Cook only corrected his ship time on
reaching the first civilised port, •which was
Batavia. If Cook’s Australian dates stand
in need of adjustment his M.L. dates, which
Prof. Wood has left untouched, call for
similar correction; so, indeed, does the log
of the whole voyage; also the log of every
other maritime explorer of the period.
THE LONE OLD GENT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Lonely old Gent., small income, meet Lady, same,
alone, own house, view above. Week. Age.”
The spring, with light fantastic hand,
Is touching up the world again;
By splashes from its magic wand
All winter’s drabnesses are slain.
Romance in various places blooms
And finds in pen and ink a vent;
Cupid, the mischievous, presumes
To stir to love a lone old gent.
His aches are gone, his gout forgot,
The winter from his heart is fled;
He feels his old blood running hot
And frivolous fancies in his head.
As forth he skips no more he knows
The touch of age in thew and bone.
A sprightly impulse through him flows—
He only knovVs that he is lone!
Oh, wonder-working wine of spring
That stirs the heart to youthful joys
And sets the veterans wondering
If they are any more than boys l
While lads and lasses love-vows sigh,
In their affinities content,
May you not move some tender eye
To smile upon a lone old gent. ?

“X2X”: Can any biologist suggest why it
that some Australian animals refuse absolutely
to breed in captivity, though generally very prolific
in their wild state ? A friend possesses two walla-
bies, a male and a female, of the small grey
variety, and although they are kept within a large
enclosure, in which they have plenty of space and
fresh air, with a small patch of scrub and trees,
they have failed to produce any offspring during the
two years he has had them. The same thing has
frequently occurred in zoological collections, to the
annoyance of the authorities, although, strange to
say, it docs not seem to be the ease at Taronga
Park, Sydney, where the majority of Australian
specimens reproduce regularly. The phenomenon is
more pronounced when such animals are sent to a
foreign country, when, no matter how ideal their
surroundings may be, or how closely they may
approximate to their natural environment, they in-
variably refuse to breed at all. Some time ago it
was reported that of a number of kangaroos, walla-
bies and paddvmelons that had been sent to some
American zoos, not a single pair had given birth
to any young ones, despite the fact that the condi-
tions of their captivity were as perfect as they could
ba made.

“Observer”: “Troopliorse,” who said he
had seen the reflection of a rainbow in the sea,
was probably correct. Travelling recently in the Nor-
wegian fjords I saw a perfect rainbow and its
reflection. The sun was shining brightly on a
distant village, and the rainbow appeared to rest
on a point at the entrance to the fjord we were
traversing and was reflected on its water, forming
a complete circle which seemed to come within a
few' feet of our yacht. There was also another
bright reflection in the sky, and it seemed as if
nature had made a bower of rainbows for our
delight.
“Pick”: To stalk kangaroos is an impos-
sibility if the advance is on the windward side,
but they may be approached almost in the open
from leeward. The successful ’roo-shooter stalks
them upwind when a gale is blowing and the roar
in the trees deadens noise. Then with a rifle-
silencer and smokeless cartridges he may blaze
away. Often a victim tumbling over and struggling
does not alarm the mob. They' hop inquiringly
about, and half a dozen may be knocked over be-
fore the others decide that there is something un-
healthy about the place. On the Mountain Ash
Range, beside the Maclaughlin River (N.S.W.), I once
saw Harry Solomon kill 11 out of a mob Of about
30 before the survivors took to flight.
* * * *
“Coolabah”: I wonder what is the reason
that so many cow's having once borne twins make a
practice of it. We once had a roan cow which
invariably produced her calves two at a time. Later
on a grand-daughter of hers, after bearing single
calves a few times, began producing twins and
continued to do so till her death. On one occasion
the newly-born calves were each enveloped in a
parchment-like case and had to be liberated by the
dairyman. They were the second pair of twins
within one y'ear.
* * * *
“Wilga”: In Northern. Queensland and
New Guinea is found a curious family' of ants: a
species of the Camponotide. Instead of digging nests
they sew leaves together in a green
treetop, forming a mass as large
as a football. So easily are these
nests destroyed that the ants de-
fend them very savagely, for,
though not provided with stings,
they can attack with their homy
jaws. The mature ants have no
power to spin thread, and this is
done by the larv;e, which provide
the silk to join the leaves while
they are held in position by some
of the adults, a supply of material
being kept ready by others. The
abos. make a drink from the bodies
of these ants. They are honey-
feeders, and when immersed in
water give out a sweetish fluid.
* * *•
“Muckadilla”: As a sheep-
farmer I had always regarded the
crow as a valuable ally against
the blowfly, but lately have altered
my opinion. Two of my neighbors
whose ewes were lambing watched
seven crow's attack a strong lamb
about three weeks old. The
attack seemed seemed to have been
organised. First one crowd
seized the lamb by the tail, and
flapping along, its back as it raced
away tried to throw it, but without
success. This bird was then re-
lieved by a second, who went
through the same performance, and
so on until the third and fourth.
The last succeeded in throwing
the lamb, when all seven pounced
on and killed it. My friends
were only about 300 yards away,
and hurried to the spot, only to
find the lamb terribly torn and at
its last gasp. Another neighbor,
noticing a number of fat. strong
ew y es and four-month-old lambs
short of an eye, could not account
for it until early one morning
he saw two crows flying at the
heads of his feeding sheep trying
to pick an eye out.
Lp jNorth"; An old hatter pal of mine
with whom 1 was dossing owned a hefty tom-cat dead
nuts on snakes. We woke up one night to the deuce
of a row among the overturned billycans. Lighting
the hurricane-lamp we saw puss spitting sparks and
with his fur standing like a porcupine’s quills.
Dodging round the camp-oven was a hefty carpet-
snake, and the things he was hissing would have
melted the dripping in the fat-pot. “Doan’ git
out,” drawled Wire-whiskers to me. “Tom’ll stoush
’im inside ten rounds.” Tom did. He swung at
the snake’s head, connected and bounced sideways,
for he could sidestep like a streak of lightning.
Then he bounced in the air and hit the snake’s
big, flat head a resounding “bang” from behind. I
noticed that Tom had a wonderfully long reach. The
snake picked its head up from the ashes, and, with
glaring eyes, uncoiled and came straight for Thomas,
who sprang fair over its head and, landing half-
way down its body, clawed the serpent into a knot
of lashing coils, but was up in safety on my bunk
as the snake’s head doubled back over its own
length. He sprang down again, and. as old Carpet’s
head shot out., hopped clean over it with a down-
ONLY ONE BEAUTY.
MRS. SMITH : "Joe was away fishin’ when the baby -was born, an' lie wired me, ‘Got one

ward jab that banged the startled rustler’s nose
on the hard clay floor. These tiring-out tactics went
on for nearly an hour before the dilapidated serpent
bad enough of it. He threw up all aggressive notions,
and showed that he badly wanted to get home to
mother. But Tom wasn’t having any, and as fast
as the snake essayed to crawl away through one
of the numerous cracks in the hut the cat clawed
at his tail until, wearily hissing, he doubled back.
His tired eyes said plainly : “If you’ll only let me
go, Puss, I’ll swear I won't hurt you!” Puss did
let him go, and the snake, thinking it was a fair
go, made haste to get through the slabs. Then Tom
alighted on the back of his neck like a doubled-up
ball. There was a sudden, fierce writhing of coils
and a slow, tremulous stretching out. The humped-
back cat sprang off, glaring at the dying snake, bitten
clean through the back of the head. Old Whiskers
blew out the light. “That dam’ cat is gettin’ too
slow,” he complained drowsily; “wants some new
glands or somethin’.”
* * * *
“Myeldern”: Anyone who tries to spy on
an aboriginal ceremony, against
the wishes of the blacks, deserves
all that comes to him. I’ve had
a fair experience of the abo., both
myall and civilised, and have seen
a good few of their ceremonies
at various times; but I would not
dream of spying on their secret
rites. Whenever I’ve gone it has
been as the invited guest of the
king and elders of the tribe. Then
I've been welcomed, and made free
of everything. I am “good mate”
to about half the coastal tribes of
the N.T., because they know that
I don't go sneaking round in
places where I have no business to
be. To do so leaves a bad im-
pression that the white man is an
interfering, prying busybody,
always sticking his nose int*
things that don’t concern him, and
quite probably the next white man
round that district in corroboree
time (“making young man”) will
get a spear through him.
“Wonkonguru”: Re übo. dialects (B.
35/6/’25), “Bunya” is probably right in his theory,
but I think a contributing factor is the astonish-
ingly short memory of the abo. A small party if
separated from the main tribe for a couple of years
would forget its language and have just about re-
placed it. The only words that seem permanent are
those that mean something unpleasant, and such
words would hardly be used to name a child. This
seems to support “Bunya’s” theory. A lot of misap-
prehension appears to have arisen through the many
places that bear, at first sight, a filthy name, but
this means nothing more than that the water or con-
ditions were unpleasant. The abos. made the same
word serve for many purposes. The one word “kudna”
for instance, is in fairly general use by most of the
tribes, and means anything dirty or unpleasant; mud
is kudna, decayed meat is kudna, and so on. Thus
if a blaekfellow calls a place “kudnannie” it signi-
fies muddy or dirty water. Another place may be
called “pia koodnaanie,” which means that the
water has been fouled by birds’ dung, whilst an-
other place is described as “tidna-kudna-inna,”
meaning that it is a boggy waterhole. The list
could be continued indefinitely ; but it would be hard
to find an instance in which the name carried an
intentionally vulgar significance.
“Bunya”: Will someone kindly settle the
never-ending argument among Queensland bushmen
as to the nesting habits of wild ducks? It is claimed
by many that they nest on the ground, among the
reeds in swamps and lagoons; others are equally
sure that the nest is made in a hollow tree standing
in water, and that the young, when ready, tumble
out and begin to swim at once. It is quite certain
that many ducks do nest in hollow trees at some dis-
tance from water, and that starts the row all over
again. Some swear that a parent carries each
duckling to the ground in its bill, and the young-
ster then sets off for the nearest water on foot.
Others swear harder still that each young bird
is carried separately in the bill from the nesting
hollow to the water. Honors seem to he easy.
-X- * * *
“Biroobi” : It is a curious fact that, while
many tiny insects have prominent glowing or com-
pound eyes, others are almost blind or totally so.
Termites are without sight, and probably without
hearing, while some other varieties of ants possess
prominent eyes, and the lace-wing family have

the most beautiful of all. The green lace-wing has
golden orbs, and the dragon-fly two eyes of the com-
pound kind, almost touching each other and giving
a wide scope of vision. Spiders have eight eyes,
but they give very poor sight. Kars, or hearing
apparatus, are placed in most unexpected places on
the bodies of some insects and in others are so
rudimentary as not to be discernible. Ants and similar
insects have tiny depressions on their antenna'. These
may act as organs of hearing, as they are very
sensitive, and no doubt convey impressions received
from vibration. The ears of the locust are placed
on its abdomen close to the hopping thighs. Long-
horns carry theirs on the front legs.

SEPTEMBER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Well, welcome, old September! I know that you are
back—
I could not help remember, before this almanac.
Amid the city’s clatter I greet you as a name.
You really do not matter.... But, wel come, just the
same.
J used to greet you gladly (I haven’t quite forgot!)
And, then—l say it sadly—you mattered quite a lot.
So, welcome, old September ! 1 thought.... was
wondering
It bush birds still remember those songs they used
to sing ;
If cedars in the hollow are blowing fresh and strong;
II “Follow, follow, follow !’’ still sings the billabong ;
If moonlit gums are gleaming, austere and still and
white,
Or glowing in the streaming of ruddy dawning light;
If furry folk are peeping among the lawyer-vine;
If gods the hills are steeping in red and amber wine;
If brambles hold their flowers to see the caliph sun,
Or star-dust gilds the bowers where dewy webs are
spun ;
If, loitering, a river flows idly to the sea,
By banks where tall reeds quiver and winds weave
melody;
If ’neath their rocky fountains the silver shadows lie ;
If trees seem on the mountains strong pillars of the
sky;
If laden bees are flashing like racing flecks of gold;
If waterfowl arc splashing—if all is as of old.
Oh, welcome, old September! 1 find you mean a lot
To one who would remember and hasn’t quite forgot.

Its Amazing Success
The Result of Value
That is the one issue in the most astounding sales success of motordom. The greatest
of all Essex values is responsible for the greatest of all Essex years. No car at or near
the price rivals it in actual proof of value—which is SALES.
With Hudson it has established the record of the largest selling 6-cylinder car in the world.
Why It Outsells All Rivals
Most notable of its supremacies is the Essex
Built by Hudson, under Hudson patents, it shares
the advantages of the famous Super-Six in perform-
ance, reliability and enduring, trouble-free service*
Its economy includes not only the lowest oper-
ation costs, but the most substantial of all savings
long life, freedom from repair need and low main-
tenance, with exceptionally high resale value*
In performance and reliability; in easy driving and
riding; in quality materials and workmanship, this
is the finest Essex ever built. And with its low first
cost you sacrifice no pleasure, comfort or good
looks that large, high-priced cars can give.
As a Hudson product, Essex has behind it the
stability of fifteen years' manufacturing experience
and a standard of service that has been developed
around the policy of satisfied ownership.
Because greatest value for the money has been
the one policy with Hudson-Essex, they have
earned their reputation as the “World’s Greatest
Values.” Everywhere you hear it. Sales prove it.
The
COACH
The Hudson-Essex invention,
and more than four years’ de-
velopment of the Coach, of
course, give it exclusive manu-
facturing advantages in this
type. No car at or near the
price rivals the Hudson-Essex

“C. Coral”:
Waterspouts play round
Torres Strait in the
nor’-west season, and
are particularly notice-
able near the Three
Sisters group. One or
two luggers have been
lost there through get-
ting inside these
marine willy-willies.
At Waraber Island,
one of the group, a
spout forming close in
usually takes its course
clean across one end
of the island and into
the sea again on the
other side, whistling
through the trees and
bush, though without
doing much damage.
The islanders have in
old “waterspout
shrine,” built of stones
and shell, with one
large black stone as
its central object; be-
hind this a wangai-
tree pole was erected,
on which were cut on
both sides a series of
faces, with cassowary
feathers decorating the
top. This represented
the spirits of the water-
spout. When festival
was made, this pole
was carried in proces-
sion by three men, who
with others danced
along the road to the
village and “made
happy” so that the
nor’-west visitor might
not unduly worry their
island. On the same
island one of the old
Zogo-grounds, where
the heads gained 'n
man-hunts were de-
posited. has recently
come to light. Each
head was accompanied
by a trumpet-shell
( Fiisus ), which was pierced and used on the canoe
to communicate the information that the owner had
been successful. On landing it was deposited at the
Zogo-ground, a big shell for a man and a smaller
one for a woman or boy. The remains of the pre-
sent shrine comprise about a hundred shells, so that
some good hauls must have been made.
* * * *
“J.D.C.”: Has anyone noticed that a tired
sheep-dog trotting behipd a horse always travels
obliquely ? If going
due north his head
will be pointing in
that direction, but his
body is carried at an
angle about n.-w. by
n. This is more appa-
rent when he sticks to
a “trot,” and the more
tired he becomes the
more shoulder-first he
travels. I haven't
noticed this peculiarity
in dogs of the hunting-
type, but the barb or
kelpie, on a hot day
and on a dusty road,
invariably drops into a
side-on dog'-trot which
he can maintain for
miles at a stretch.
Some bushmen assert
that dogs with long,
heavy tongues are more
addicted to this
method of travel ; and
as the dog’s tongue,
when he is hot and
tired, hangs well out
and usually to one side,
the “side-on” peculi-
arity may have some-
thing to do with bal-
ance. When racing
flat-out the tongue does
not swing, and the
body travels direct—
no counter-balance be-
ing required—but when
turning at speed the
tail plays an import-
ant part, the body be-
ing then temporarily
off the straight line. This is arguing from the other
end, but tends to bear out the tongue-balancin'* -
theory.

The kauri gum-fields of North
Auckland (M.L.) are full of interest, especially to
one whose work brings him into contact with the
niggers and settlers. My particular job is breaking
these lands in for farming. Most diggers know the
‘‘gum-diggers’ soap,” but Maorilanders as a whole
do not seem to be familiar with it, though it may
be found almost anywhere on the gum lands. Spear-
ing and digging for fossil gum is not a clean job,

but “the soap” is always near by. *rt is produced by
a plant known as kumarahou, or, to the botanist, as
Vomaderris elliptica, and belongs to the daisy family.
It is a sparingly-branched, erect shrub, with bluish-
green oblong leaves covered underneath with white
downy hairs. The creamy buds, when rubbed up
with water, give the best lather, and the leaves also
furnish a good one. When the hands are dried the
skin feels soft and pleasant. This particular sapolin
has not been investigated scientifically, so here is a
chance for some young Maoriland graduate to sand-
wich in a bit of research.

“Polycarp”: Has it yet been decided
whether the male or female coachwhip-bird gives
the crack at the end of the call ? These birds arc
more plentiful in the thick scrubs of southern
Bananaland than anywhere further south. I have
often kept an eye on the almost black olive-green
male and his mate without a crest, and am ready
to swear that both sexes take part in the complete
call; alsb that each of them can go through the
performance alone. They are often confused with
the little thunder-birds (golden-breasted whistlers)
of the same scrubs, with a whip-crack note, though
less perfect.

“H.E.R.”: “Tamornie” has no need to
go as far as New Guinea to find his dry-cooked sea
food (B. 30/7/’25). The tiny fish resembling sardines
are probably smelt, a diminutive species that abounds
half-way round Australia. The ordinary method of
preparation is to gut and behead them with one
draw of the knife and then fry to a brittle crispness
like chipped potatoes. After that they will keep
for months, requiring only a warm-up in a frying-pan
to make them taste as if they had just left home.
* * * *
“Taupo”: “Up Top” (B. 23/7/’25) was
pretty near the mark when he said that it is cooler
to be out walking in the blazing sun than to be lying
under an inefficient shelter. After some years north
of Capricorn I am convinced that a well shaken up
liver is needed to keep fit in the tropics. Incident-
ally, this explains why Queensland station women
do not stand the heat nearly as well as the men.
The latter lead an energetic life, while the women,
during the hot season, curtail their work as much as
possible and lie in the shade trying to get cool. This
produces a sluggish liver, and their last state is worse
than the first.
* * * *
“Wingella”: I remember an adobe wall
that stood on a flat near a creek in the N.T. Built
entirely of antbed and small stones, it stood exposed
to the elements for over 10 years and then needed a pick
to demolish it. The ground had fair natural drainage,
but the wet season sometimes meant a week’s solid
rain, and always from 40 to 60 inches fell in the
period, so that the wall got some severe testing. In
any case, if coastal districts are unsuitable for
adobe, how is it that ovens of antbed rammed
hard have survived in good condition for 15 to 20
years? Certainly they are dome-shaped, and the
water does not lie on them, but they are never
covered nor protected in any way.
“Jim Carew”: What weight can go over
a snake without injuring it? Driving a big car, with
six others besides myself in it, between Bermagui
and Oobargo (N.S.W.), I noticed a big black snake
leisurely crossing the road in front of us. I put on
pace, and ran over him, distinctly feeling the slight
bump as the front and the back wheels struck his
back. I pulled the car up quickly, expecting to
find a badly-crushed snake, but saw instead a re-
markably lively one disappearing into the bush. As
the road where I ran over him had a hard metalled
surface, the incident left me wondering.
* * * *
“F.T.K.”: Up on Moa Island, Torres
Strait, the difficulty of accommodation and where
to house the kids presents no terrors. When in
1905 the Kanakas were deported from Queensland
those exempted were Islanders who owned property,
those who had married native women, and those
who had worked for 20 years or more in the State.
Most of these exempted cases settled on Moa, and
made a little paradise of it by building houses
and surrounding them with gardens which would
make a suburban amateur go dilly with envy. One
enterprising gentleman built himself a home designed
like an eight-pointed star. Each point had a
recess destined to be the particular niche for each
fresh member of the family as it arrived. No
doubt the full complement of tenants would in time
be reached.
“C.J.L.”: “Wingella” (B. 2/7/25*) asks
some Abo.-liar to identify a fish caught at Darwin
(N.T.). The description fits an old friend, the
wompigong- shark, almost as common in Southern
Q. as catfish. Owing to their number and the fact
that they will eat anything, dead or alive, they
are a curse to line fishermen, who find it practically
impossible to get a hook out of their wonderfully
strong and tough jaws. “Wompy” is so daring that
it will crawl into 2in. of w r ater after the offal
thrown aside by the fish cleaner, who has no difficulty
in grabbing it by the tail and landing it high and
dry. Its average length is from a foot to three
feet, although in some places it grows up to 10ft.
Incidentally, this shark does not turn over when
attacking.
* * * #
“Pick”: From the McLaughlin River
(N.S.W.), after eel-fishing, my fencing mates and 1
ascended the steep ridge of the Slierwin Range, and
traversed one of the upland paddocks of Bungarby
station. We were then about midway between the
McLaughlin and the Snowy, and three miles from
either river. There, slithering over the dew-wet
grass at a fast rate was an eel. No fish-tenanted
waters lay nearer than the rivers, and plainly this
fellow was overlanding from one to the other. I
had often seen a captured slimy, when dropped on
to wet grass out of the bag, hurriedly squirm off
towards the nearest water; but this was the only
occasion I have known one to cross country on his
own. We permitted the wanderer to continue his
way down the mountain.
* * * *
“A.V.R.”: Our dogs raised a Too on
the side of a range in the Cox’s River district
(N.S.W.). Following up, we came on them in a
gully with the old man bailed up. He was sitting
bolt upright, the dogs just keeping beyong- reach of
his paws. On coming closer, we saw that he had
impaled himself on a spear-pointed myrtle-scrub
stick and done it so completely that the dogs
must have had him bailed up Some time without
knowing that he had been punctured. The stick
was at the foot of a big granite boulder off which
he must have jumped.
HAD HAD HIS OPPORTUNITIES.
“Didn’t I ought to know more about the
Bible than you?”
“Course y’ ought. They always put one in
yer cell, don’t they?”
“ J.A.” : What has become of the millions
of brolgas that were to be met with in years gone
by ? I remember travelling by rail from Mount
Gambier to Millicent (S.A.), just after a big fire
had swept the country, and mile, after mile the
black ground could scarcely be seen for brolgas.
They were there in countless thousands. Yet to-day
one could travel hundreds of miles through the same
district without meeting a single bird.
THE WATCHERS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A forked log straddled from hob to hob,
As a tree may straddle a stream ;
The hot sap boiled at the broken ends,
Then bubbled away in steam.
A blackened kettle swung from a hook
(’Twas a dirge that it had to sing) ;
And the watchers gazed at the dancing flames
As they sat in a silent ring.
A cold wind whistled through chink and crack,
Eor it followed a fall of rain ;
It frayed and rattled a paper patch
That covered a broken pane,
While the watchers waited with ears alert
Eor a sound from the sufferer’s bed;
And one crept in to adjust the clothes
Or the cushion beneath his head.
The old man’s beard drooped low on his chest,
As he smoked with never a word;
But his wife crept softly to and fro
Whenever the sufferer stirred.
The forked log glowed with a red-hot heat,
While a pine log spluttered and sparked;
Then the old man opened the door and peered
As a dog in the stable barked.
He peered to the west where a rough track led
To the township that lay afar;
And he looked in vain, where it crossed the plain.
For the lights of the doctor’s car.
His wife glanced up as he closed the door;
’Twas only her eyes that spoke.
His long beard wagged as he shook his head,
And the forked log tilted and broke.
They had waited long for the doctor’s car,
All day they had watched in vain ;
The weight at their hearts hung dull as lead,
Like a horse’s head on a rein.
The old man’s face and the mother’s face
Were grey and the lines were deep,
And their eyes were heavy and shot with blood
That told of the want of sleep.
Then one of the children poked the fire
And righted the fallen log;
And one slipped out by the kitchen-door.
To silence the restless dog.
The youngest dozed on a rough-hewn stone
And nodded a heavy head;
And the mother gestured a mute command
That the child should go to bed.
But the house-dog whined as a cold dog whines
And howled as a lost dog howls ;
Then slipped his collar and scurried in
To the shed with the sleeping fowls.
The rooster crowed and his crow was loud,
With a piercing kind of a sound
That ’wakened the cocks on tree and roost
For more than a mile around.
The old wife started and stared aghast
At the face of the trashy clock,
As the sufferer turned on his stretcher bed
At the sound of the crowing cock.
CAP’N SCORES ONE.
“Nice drop of rain we’m ’avin’ since Labor Gurerment got in,
Cap’n.”
“Just what I ’spected, m' son.”
“Just what you ’spected, Cap’n!”
“Av coorse. The Loord wouldn’t trust a Labor Government with
a drought.”
But the hands of the trashy clock crept round
And its tick told never a tale;
And the ends of the great forked log yet glowed
AVhen the sky in the east was pale.
A fringe of eoals on the hearth was black,
A mound of ashes was grey;
Through the shrunken logs the chill wind crept
That heralds the break of day.
Then the wife tip-toed to the sick one’s side—
His brow was cool and he slept.
The old man smiled as he filled his pipe,
But the mother knelt and wept.

The love of a good horse- —in fact, of
many good horses —drew crowds to the
V.A.T.C. meeting at Caulfield on Saturday,
for “the picked” were out against Heroic in
the Memsie Stakes. Breathlessly the thou-
sands watched the champion at the barrier.
From the distant lawns he seemed to stand
like a lamb beside the clerk of the course,
and in silence the punters followed the race
until the turn for home. When Heroic came
dashing along with Whittier and Spearfelt
behind, there was a roar of delight; and
Governor Stradbroke had to face the defeat
of his champion Night Patrol. Nearly as
big a demonstration greeted the Ben Chaf-
feys’ Manfred when it led many splendid
horses in the Heatherlie Handicap.
Vice-royalty was there in strength, the
G.-G. and liis Jady looking their last on Caul-
field, and Governor Stradbroke and his
Countess viewing the racing from their en-
closure. The chilly weather brought out fine
furs and anything new in end-of-the-
season winter-apparel. Lady Forster was
in beige-liued wrap-coat, broidered, collared
and cuffed with black coney; a natural
feather mount adorned her black millinery.
Lady Stradbroke’s all-black was also fur-
trimmed, and her sable hat bore applique of
velvet leaves. A navy blue coat with squirrel
collar and feathered millinery was worn by
Miss Carletou. Of the vice-regal guests was
Mrs. Norman Brookes, whose platinum lace
frock shone beneath a mole fur coat —her
bat was of cerise hue. Looking more Queen -
Maryish even than usual, Mrs. W. J. T.
Clarke swung a flowing black cape with a
squirrel collar and black feather fronds peep-
ing from the turbaned toque. Mrs. Sydney
Sturt, who leaves for the Cold World this
week, sported gold-and-blue painted quills
upon grey hatting, above black coney and
blue. Mrs. Ben Gliaffey, in a charming hat
of blue Bangkok, had Mrs. T. Tabart under
her royal-blue-and-black wing. Very smart
was Mrs. Fred Grimwade’s ensemble suit
of red-and-black check, her spinal cord being
traced with red bone buttons, and Mrs.
Carlos Basualdo —America’s dancer who was
Leonora Hughes—was a beauty in real
leopard-skin with attachments of red fox
fur and a ship’s cable of pearls, which the
whole day’s stakes would hardly have pur-
chased. A Patou ensemble model of grey
georgette, Chinchilla fur and lilac millinery
which bung upon Mrs. Wally Mitchell was
the prettiest frock seen. Champagne velour
topped Mrs. Barry Thomson’s sapphire-blue
velvet wrap-coat.
The younger set looked alike as peas in a
pod in tailored suits or fur or teased wool
bordered coats with pull-on small felt hats.
A little different was Peggy Ewing, in short
tan coat over a plaid skirt, with felt head-
piece.
Farewells with which genuine regrets are
mingled are • marking the last few weeks
of the Forsters’ reign at Federal Govern-
ment House. September 1 found the graci-
ous lady saying good-bye to members of the
Sailors’ and Soldiers’ Mothers’ Association
at a tea-party at Anzae House. An illumi-
nated address bound in tooled leather, with
a photo of the president, a memorial tablet
and a basket of violet primroses and wattle,
was handed to her Excellency by Mrs. S.
J. Southey, while presidents of various subur-
ban associations voiced their lamentations.
Austral Salonites feted Moscovitch and his
wife the other afternoon, Leila Heron hos-
tessing in russet-brown and beaver fur, with
black millinery. President Mrs. Thomas
Baker breathed words of welcome and placed
the aims and objects of the salon before the
company. The Russian star talked breezily
on women’s place on both sides of the foot-
lights. “Rather Early-Victorian,” mur-
mured some over his statement that women
should be inspirers of man’s work rather
than doers thereof. Wedged in between chat
and tea-drinking was a musical programme
provided by Mrs. Kroef. Lilian Hamilton.
Mrs. Maurice Dudley, Kingsley Parkes and
C. Richard Ghugg. Black kasha with
attachments of ivory lace and squirrel fur
clothed Moscovitcli’s inspirer, who conformed
to her lord’s ideas by merely bowing her
thanks for the party.
The latest silk spring hosiery has a woven
band of contrasting color just below the knee
to simulate the garter. Lest mankind should
forget or miss the significance, a wee sprig
or posy of satin blossoms is attached.
The lounge of Cliveden Mansions staged a
gathering of theatrical and professional folk
the other afternoon, bidden by Mrs. Barry
Thomson, who has a flat in the building,
to meet Mr. find Mrs. Carlos Basualdo, the
round-the-world honeymooners. _ The hostess
wore a shoulder spray of orchids upon her
delphinium blue georgette gown, with beaded
design in petunia pink and blue, her Bang-
kok chapeau being likewise blue. Mrs.
Basualdo was a study in mist blue in en-
semble suit and hat, the former being prinked
up with Chinchilla fur. Visitors included
many of the “No, No, Nanette” co., some
J.C.W. artists, Mr. and Mrs. Athol Tier,
Eileen Castles, Alice Maddigan, Mrs. Wal-
lace Mitchell (whoso daughters sent a basket
of violets to the guest of honor) and Miss
Franklin King, an overseas traveller, who
aired an anklet of brilliants.
When Melbourne’s charity or social-
welfare workers announce a bridge party or
cafe chantant, you can wager your last half-
crown that the entertainment is merely a
peg upon which to hang sales of some kind.
Therefore when the Best dame held a bridge-
party at the Windsor Hotel no one was
surprised to find enterprising and charmingly-
gowned society folk selling antiques, dolls
and other trifles —all in aid of the hostess s
sweet stall at the coming Girl Guide cafe
chantant at Government House. Lady Strad-
broke looked in and left some coin. Margot
Best and Mr. 11. P. Ogilvie lion, secretaned
the banditry, Mrs. J. H. Hewison (honorary
gen. sec. of the appeal) lending her aid.
A performance at the Playhouse of Barrie s
“Alice Sit-by-the-Fire” will give a nice htt
to the finances of the Melbourne Hospital
Auxiliary’s entertainment branch. Mrs.
Apperly, a very attractive Alice, shepherded
the amusing thing as well as playing in it.
Elizabeth Woodyatt, in saxe blue and coral
pink, was delightfully priggish as the sell-
sacrificing Amy. Mrs. G. H. Healy lion, sec-
retaried. Mrs. Edward Spowers had Ellison
S powers—lion. sec. of this branch —and other
prettily-covered maidens vending the gor-
geous primroses, daffodils, violets and other
blooms sent for sale. Mrs. Iv. Baillieu she
was Gracie Lavers —looking more charming
even than in her musical-comedy days, sold
programmes in black-and-silver robing.
St. Kilda Town Hall, dolled up in red,
yellow and black, suggested war days and
a Belgian benefit the other night when the
students of Ormond College jazzed after their
annual fashion. Hon. secretaries L. Liddle
and I. M. Anderson recorded a great success.
Master of Ormond D. K. Picken and Mrs.
Picken, with professors from sister colleges,
were in attendance. Beads and fringe ran
riot on many beauteous rags ; dancers w T ere
mainly young and unattached.
With this is a little picture of Mrs. H. O
Walker, who has joined forces w;ith Alice
Currie in a
contribution to
the Arts and
Crafts exliibi-
tio n, to be

morrow at the
Town II a 11.

tors will show

f )• o m the
trees and edged
with colored
hank - string,
mats of raffia and stray bits of woollen
materials, and furniture of kerosene-cases
and petrol-tins are some of them. The little
enterprise was inspired by a tale, and here
it is. A “pommy” settler sought, medical
advice. The doctor was not satisfied with
his patient’s progress, so inquired what was
worrying her. To his astonishment the lady
replied, “Oh, those awful pink doors!” An
Aussie housewife would have white-washed
those doors or scraped the offending color
off with hubby’s razor; but this poor help-
less stranger suffered in silence. If Mrs.
Walker and her co-worker’s ideas get known
there will be no need for fresh arrivals to
put up with pink doors again.
Mrs. Barry Thomson, wife of Melbourne’s
well-known medico, may now be considered
a fully-fledged Australian. Her lately-
acquired possession, Switzerland, is among
the entries for the Spring turf events.
Berlei, Ltd., has been scattering lilac-hued
invitations for four demonstrations, morn-
ing and afternoon, at the King’s Theatre, of
their feminine supports. The show must
have a name; and “So This Is Elegance”
runs on popular lines. Fred Burley, founder
of the firm, who has just returned from the
U.S.A., did the opening sayings. The corsets
recall the remark of a mere man, who, con-
trasting the flat, straight figure of the fair
sex of to-day with her shapely anatomy of
yesterday, inquired: “But where do they
put the spare parts?”
Came this way from the Harbor city last
week Rupert Beale, who is off for a holiday
in Eastern Asia. With John Heughan,
brother of singer William, he intends to
penetrate places where the usual tourist does
not go. Rupert is of the pianoforte firm
which can claim royal patronage since Mary
of Windsor secured for her own an instru-
ment shown at Wembley.
Tet another young Aussie pianist has
loomed above the horizon —Nora Colstad, of
Westralia, whose talents have been nurtured
by Benno Scherek. At a recital at the
home of Mr. and Mrs. Scherek she gave a
sample which a privileged few pronounced
of rare excellence. Indeed, not many diploma
students of either Sydney or Melbourne Con.
could have handled a memorised programme
so well. A feature was the complete Rubin-
stein Concerto, with teacher Benno at the
second piano; solos included _ a wonderful
Prelude by the Spanish Albeniz, and pieces
by Manuel de Falla, Scriabin, Clmpin-Liszt,
Schumann and Chopin, with the Eiszt para
phrase of “Rigoletto” and a delightful “dis
arrangement” for two pianos, by her teacher,
of Chopin’s D-flat Waltz. The girl’s splen-
did technique, capital tone color and sin-
cerity should make her more than merely
“promising” when she arrives at her first
public recital in a few months’ time.
Of last week’s hops the annual rally of
the Old Collegians’ Club of the Methodist
Ladies’ College was the smartest. St. Kilda
Town Hall sheltered it. Ten debs., tlieir
pink posies blending with white and silver
frocks, made obeisance to the O.C.C. presi-
dent, Mrs. Alan Southey, who brightened
black raiment with Oriental beads. Hon.
sec. Olive Dodd, delightfully upholstered in
blue tones, touched up with fur and dia-
mente; vice-president Mrs. W. L. Russell,
and two dozen committee maidens helped
Mrs. L. Blanchard to set things spinning.
Lucy Stogdale, only daughter of the Frank
Stogdales of East Malvern, who trips off
with mamma to the Great Smoke shortly, had
her 17th birthday last week, and to celebrate
the glad event the charming gardens of Yar-
rayne were festooned in colored lights and
Chinese lanterns, and 150 girls and boys one-
stepped in a ballroom set with flags and
palms, and had a sumptuous bit to eat in
a gaily-decorated marquee. The hostess wore
black crepe madrilene jet embroidered, and
Sweet Seventeen’s party frock was apple-
green ninou with inlets of silver lace.
Glistening beaded raiment of Oriental red
tone was worn by Mrs. M'cCallum Neil,
and her daughter Molly was in geranium
georgette also beaded.
Mrs. Mary Simpson, who, as “Weeroona,”
has contributed many sketches to The Bul-
letin, is also a playwright. Her comedietta,
“Suspicion,” produced by Mrs. A. E. Barker,
was well received at the annual drama night
of the Australian Literature Society at the
Railways Institute.
St. Andrew's, Hobart, housed an Air
Force wedding last week, when Phyllis Bir-
ehall, only chick of the late W. A. and Mrs.
Birchall, of Sandy Bay, married Flight-
Lieutenant R. J. Brownell, of Point Cook.
The colors of the Air Force, with heaps
of yellow and blue flowers, turned the old
church into a place of beauty. The bride
was in gold-embroidered georgette, with a
gold-lined brocade train and a coronet of
orange blossoms over a net veil. Margery
Brownell and Doreen Birchall ’maided in
lemon georgette, with touches of blue. Flying-
Officers Swinbourne and F'ryer-Smith sup-
ported the ’groom.
Melbourne Music Club members met at
the Victorian Artists’ Society’s headquarters
one day last, week to hear those clever young
artists Katie Diddle and Rene Morrissy
lure harmony out of two pianos. First hear-
ings of three fragmentary pieces by Percy
Grainger, sent along to Fritz Hart by the
composer; settings of a folk-song from Faroe
Island, and works by Arnold Bax, Debussy,
Devernoy, Aubert, Arensky and Dclius-
Grainger filled the evening with excellently-
presented melody. Katie Liddle’s fairness
was set off by georgette draperies of powder
blue, with touches of pink and mauve, and
Rene’s dark shingle waved above frockmg
of pink brocaded crepe de Chine.
Two bright youths on their way across the
water on the Naldera are Melbourne Uni.
graduates —R. R. Garran (son of the legal
knight) and C. M. Tattam. Both B.Sc.’s,
with a year’s research behind them, they are
off to the Cold Land to do more lab. work —
the one in geology and the other in chem-
istry.
Excerpts from four operas were presented
by the students of the Uni. Conservatorium,
under the direction of the Ormond Professor
of Music, on two nights of last week; and
their friends, who packed the Melba Hall,
expressed their appreciation in the usual
hearty manner. On the whole the apprecia-
tion was well deserved, although the orches-
tra was too frequently too blatant. The
chorus work was rendered by selected stu-
dents with assistance from members of the
Uni. Musical Society.

who has for 29 years given her time and
talents to the newsboys. She visits them in
their homes, too —Lady Stradbroke has accom-
panied her on many such excursions—and
there is one room in the club wherein is
stocked wearing apparel for families that re-
quire such help. Wives of old boys and
the mothers of the present generation meet
periodically at the club for a chat with her,
or to hear some instructive address, and no
better tribute is paid the society than that
of the old boys, who are ever ready to give
a hand.
The Yarra Glen and Lilydale Hunt Club com-
mandeered the pretty Moonee Valley course
for its race meeting, when Winchaldean,
assisted by amateur-rider A. Bullock, col-
lected another cup for his owner, R. L.
Twomey. Many patrons braved the wintry
air, anil the women were rolled up in furs
and fur coats, a bit of cheer being added by
vivid millinery and the fact that most of the
favorites got home.
Carlyon’s ballroom, remodelled in the
Adam style with exquisitely panelled walls,
and ceiling all cream and gold-tipped, will
be re-opened next week. When the popular
hotel passed into new hands Mr. Spencer
secured the spacious adjoining ballroom, and
set the furnishers and carpenters to work.
A gala night will place the most stunning

Wilma Berkeley, of the brilliantly flexible
soprano notes, who went to London nearly
three years ago. is doing a little more than
making good. The last mail announced that
she was singing at three recitals given by
pianist Mark Hambourg.
Sister Adelaide’s troubles :
The Government, jogged by a deputation some
time ago, has decided to build a women’s hospital,
and has fixed upon the Old Exhibition Ground at
Frome-road as the site. Plans are to be got out
at once, and the Chief Secretary swears that per-
fection of arrangement and design will be the con-
sideration rather than price.
More bridge has been played for Helene Taylor,
with the Glover, T. C. Walker and Pendlebury
dames in the forefront. The singer, by the way, has
changed her name for something with an Italian
flavor. London may call her by it, but here she
is still Helene.
Four pictures from the George Cowan collection
—the Cowans are going to make their home in
Europe—are to go to the Melbourne Gallery—William
Walcot’s “Piazza Baptisterie, Florence,” Russell
Flint’s “Sunshine,” Lamorna Birch’s “Among the
Hills” and >l. Grainger Taylor’s “Girl Resting.”
The local gallery chose H. S. Tuke’s “Morning Sun.”
St. Peter’s Old Scholars gave their dance at the
College—a blue and white and gold dining-room for
ballroom, supper in the big schoolroom and the
common-room for sitting out. Guests were mostly
young, slim, short-skirted and shingled. Mrs. A.
G. Price and Mrs. Cedric Hayward gave the com-
mittee a hand, Mrs. Hareus supervised the decora-
tions, and the chaperones were Mrs. Dudley Hayward,
Mrs. Arthur Rymill and Mrs. Hareus.
Synod has brought an influx of black coats and
jaintin collars, whose owners are arguing the fine
shades of difference between heresy and discipline.
A couple of garden parties at Bishop’s Court on
heavenly days and a few lunches have given it well-
earned distraction.
It’s been glorious weather for the Golf, though
as tins goes to post it looks as if Mrs. Poole would
hand over prizes and trophies in what our Yankee
cousins would term a “mean drizzle.” Mrs. Britten
Jones must be a proud woman with the champion-
ship in her pocket for the third time running, though
it wasn’t comfortably within her reach till the third
round. For the first two Miss Gordon led her, but
went off her play in the third, while Mrs. Britten Jones
came into hers—running home a comfortable eight
strokes to the good.

Dear Sirs
1 would like to take this opportunity
to express my appreciation of the excellent work rendered
by your firm during our visit to Sydney. I have looked
over a number of orders beside my own, and haVe found a
higher quality, of work than we are used to, even from the
best finishing plants of our country. Browne tells me
that you took some of his negatives that the Honolulu
people gave up as hopeless, and made good prints from
them. He also has told me of the excellent system you
have devised for your finishing plant, which makes me
wish all the more that I could have spared the time to
look it over myself.
My only regret about our visit to your
c , * 3 wo didn't stay a month, Instead of a fort-
nlght. I have never in my life enjoyed a port as much,
and look forward to the day we may be able to return for
another visit.
Very truly yours,

Bungendore, 30th March, 1925.
Dear Sirs, —In reply to your inquiry as to how the “Isko”
machine you installed for me is working, I am pleased to say
that it has now been running for about six months, during which
time it has given me no trouble, and has proved a great boon.
I am thoroughly satisfied with the plant.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER

STOCKINGS
The innermost shrine of the Town Hall
held the altar on which Mayor Stokes laid
his offering to the Empire Press people.
Here on a morning of last week, before an
interested and devout congregation of muni-
cipal and Parliamentary dignitaries, the in-
telligentsia and merely reporters, the Press
tourists gave their first public smiles to
Sydney. Shepherding the strangers came
J. O. Fairfax, of the S. M. Herald, and
Knight of the Sun Hugh Denison. At the
top table facing the multitude sat Lord
Burnham, Sir Percival Phillips aud the
Canadian J. 11. Woods, whose father was the
Dominion’s first trade commissioner in these
parts; and scattered amidst the mighty were
the Burnham and Newnes ladies, the latter
in a delectable rig of raspberry-pink wool
marocain, above which shone her own pinks
and whites and quick smile; Lady Violet
Astor, in rigorous black, depending on her
profile for distinction; and Mrs. Henson In-
field, trimmed up with real cowslips to re-
mind her of Sussex. Hugh Denison’s lady
chaperoned her knight, and was overlooked
herself by a tall pink rose that quivered and
quirked above the brim of her spring hat.
The billy boiled and the bottle circled. Coates,
M.L.C., made a speech that was both mellow
and witty; Lord Burnham cast a benignant
and covetous eye over Australia’s empty
spaces; Sir Percival Phillips spoke confiden-
tially to the sugar-basin before him, and
always the theme was Australia, the Land
of Promise—to the immigrant. Astor and
Herbert, the gentleman from Malta and the
rest of the long, long line of silent deadheads
were somnolently gazing at the brightly-
colored bubble blowing iridescently before
them, when smack! came the speech of the
Lord Mayor—and the bubble was no more!
In place of it the face of our own unem-
ployed and landless stared rather grimly—
a reminder of the State’s lOU to its own.
A garden newly washed may be all right
in a poet’s song. But even with the sun
in his heaven, a sodden lawn is apt to make
the primrose rather reflect on the kidney;
so that every man over 40 at the vice-regal
party in honor of the Press visitors wore a
pensive look that seemed to say wistfully;
“If only goloshes were as fashionable as
spats!” Dauntless woman, though, gam-
bolled under the spreading spring hat, one of
the most spreading of them all being worn by
Mrs. James Ashton. It was of blue crinoline
that trembled on the verge of navy, and was
decked with appropriate but sparse horticul-
ture. The vice-reine supported petal-
weighted millinery in Persian blues, and was
otherwise sleek in velvets, of the same hue.
His Ex. trailed no deep-sea embellishments,
but wore an angelic smile under a tall hat
against a background of horizon-blue sup-
plied by the uniform of the attendant Cap-
tain Coote. But do not think the whole job
of entertaining was pushed on to Sir Dudley
and his lady. Mr. Harris, of the Sydney
branch of the Press Union, was also busy
doing the honoi’s —a shade more exclusively
than the vice-regals, perhaps; but, then, he
had the dignity of the Herald to uphold.
Lady Burnham, who is one of those non-
stop talkers, moved from group to group
making a pattern of words as intricate as the
beading on her stone-grey georgettes. Her
millinery was above reproach. It was of
sky-after-rain blue, and around its crown
cherry velvet loops did a kind of ring-a-ring-
a-rosy. Lady Violet Astor’s head was
adorned with the inevitable feather. In pre-
historic days she surely was a coster girl or
the wife of some forest-stalking chief.
Feathers are her war-paint, and for this par-
ticular beano they arched blue and brown
above a small black hat —delicate feajher-
fronds that mingled and stirred tantalisingly
in the breeze till you thought of brown sea-
weed in a blue lagoon. The brilliant Mrs.
Moore—she writes as “Eve Adam” —slung
her furs about her with the air of a cave
woman and paced beside a husband who wore
spats. Maoriland Knight George Fenwick
squired his lady, who trailed black georgettes
and lace, and being from the unco’ guid
South both seemed to say: “Let us not forget
that though we eat strawberry ices to-day
to-morrow’s the day of judgment!” Mrs.
Infield, who is a Sussex newspaper owner
and would pass for a large sister of Agnes
Murphy, was a notable figure: Herbert, of
Punch, was the most sought among the
males ; the inscrutable Astor, whose eyes have
the baffled look of a poet’s, again practised
his gift of surrounding himself with soli-
tude even in a crowd. Mrs. Geoffrey Fair-
fax was there, her profile at its most Gothic,
and so bediamonded she was positively daz-
zling. Mrs. Earle Page, a brown study; Miss
Preston Stanley, M.P., in a gold hat;
Mayoress Cecilia Walsh, flying a nasturtium-
hued boa; George Fuller’s lady, banded in
royal purples; and dear old copper-top
Charlie Bean were others who decked the
lawns. Home-brewed journalists? Oh, yes,
there were a few of the tribe; but they had
rather the air of the small boy who has crept
into the circus through a hole in the tent.
The University said its piece for the
Press picnickers on a sunny afternoon; and
the saying stretched from a quarter to 3
till nearly half-past 4. Into the dim. chill
Great Hall the visitors had been lured, and
once within politeness chained them to their
chairs while Big Guns rumbled their thunder
and the visitors showed just cause for being
here. Across the sun-washed quadrangle
the shadows lengthened, until when the con-
course at last bore down like a famished wolf
upon the tea-tables the cloisters were sunk
in academic gloom. Lady de Chair and Lady
Violet Astor, who came on from the Floral
Fete in the Town Hall, missed the feast of
wisdom, but had a jolly sunbath in company
with the band, the photographers, the
cinema-men, the caterers and Vice-Chancellor
MacCallum. A few whose silk and near-
silk hose were not fit raiment for the rare-
fied atmosphere of the lecture-hall drifted
about, the Fisher Collection. The vice-regal
group was as colorful as a poster exhibi-
tion. Here flamed the red robes of Vice-
Chancellor MacCallum and Deputy-Chancel-
lor Cecil Purser; here swept the rich
amethyst of Archbishop Kelly’s cloak. Lady
Burnham’s crepe de Chine was like a splash
of purple ink; and the belle of the party,
Lady Newnes, smiled above her favorite
strawberry tones. Lady de Chair wore the
newest thing in wide-brimmed millinery
ribbon-trimmed—it was of ivory tagel, while
the frock beneath it was of tailored ivory
marocains. Mrs. Cadbury (of the choco-
late press) stuck to black ottoman, but the
scarf about her shoulders was vivid enough
to be a Turkish delight, and Lady Davies’s
frocking ran to cable lengths of braid, and
her hat to wings. Two Uni. poets, Le Gay
Brereton and librarian Green; Arundel
Orchard, Syd Smith and Coates, M.L.C.,
were others who sported with tea and sand-
wich in the shade; and Mrs. MacCallum and
Mrs. Purser trailed sable draperies in con-
trast to their lords’ magnificence.
Herbert, of Punch, told the best story.
Speaking of the feeling of unreality he had
in being there making a speech before 3 in
the afternoon, he said: “I feel like one of the
old Dukes of Devonshire who dreamed that he
was making a speech in the House of Lords
—and, waking up, found that he was!”
The young man in the picture is Rupert
Markham, who has been the brigand behind
many of the
c h a r i t a ble
hold-ups of the
past two years.
Rupert is a
Newtown boy,
and it was
from there lie
won a bursary
to Sydney
Techn i c a I
School; thence
he went as an
exhibition stu-
dent to the
Uni. Engineer-
in g School.
All the 1920-
24 graduates
know Rupert,
lie put 'the
Science jour-
nal on a solid
financial foot-
ing ; he . was
treasurer of the S.U.D.S. and of the Science
Society, and member of the Hockey Club
committee. He is a front-rank worker in
the cause of the T.B. soldiers and sailors,
and was the energetic organiser of the highly
successful ball for Santa Sophia, the Cath-
olic Women’s College within the Uni. The
Day Nurseries matinee and the kiddies’ party
for Tresillian are other efforts that have
been directed by his strategy.
On Thursday afternoon it looked as
though all the flappers of Sydney were
crushed inside the Town Hall to help sur-
geon Maitland’s widow with her Floral Fete
in aid of the T.B. appeal. They were as
thick as a mist in a mountain valley and
as pervasive. In petalled frocks of indis-
creet lengths unless the legs were perfect
they surged on a wave of violet and boronia
scents from the trays they had slung before
them. Girl rosebuds and arum lilies, sweet-
peas. fuchsias, chrysanthemums and what-
not danced a minuet under the guidance of
Daphne Deane like a flower garden abloom
in season and out of season. Finally they
grouped themselves on the stage against a
background that was a monster sunflower in
whose radiance basked the Police Band. The
decorations, which came from the ingenious
and imaginative Searl’s, were truly remark-
able. The balconies might have been those
on which Young Adventure happened in old-
time Spain, and behind such fragrant lattices
even the middle-aged Juliet would have a
sporting chance. But beautiful as were the
floral outbursts, those from the kitchen gar-
den were equally enmeshing. “Oh, I must
have one of those lovely little cabbages!"
rapturously exclaimed a housewife standing
before the produce stall. But the little cab-
bages had hearts of paper, and were only
part of the decorations. Dot Brunton sold
oranges and lemons, June Elvidge helped at
a chocolate-wheel. Everybody thrust violets
on Lady Violet Astor, who supported the
vice-reine during the opening ceremony. The
Fuller dame, Mayoress Cecilia Walsh, little
Dr. Arthur and big Mrs. Spencer Brunton
were some of the afternoon’s conspirators.
Mrs. Sep Levy sold beauty secrets; and Mrs.
Nelson’s “Duchess of Devonshire” netted
over £2O for the fund. And after it was
over George Fuller’s lady went home, and
without fussation rang up the family doctor
and ordered one appendix to be removed
immediately. The operation was performed
on the plucky lady that very night.
City Tattersall’s, wearing its 30 years with
pride, received congratulations from hosts of
friends last week. Throwing its doors wide
to the ladies, the Club wore the smiling look
of one who has never hoard of a punters'
day; and not one visitor was tactless enough
to remark on a winning favorite. There
certainly was a jolly-family-party feeling
about the gathering. The caretaker had
designed and carried out the decorations—
they were in the blue-and-gold of the Club.
Fathers brought their wives and daughters,
and a few young mothers, hatted and
furred, looking in for half an hour, held
round-eyed youngsters by the hand. One
proud father brought a small girl in claret-
colored velvet, her head circled with pink
rosebuds. She looked exactly like Alice in
Wonderland. Funny men sang in the inter-
vals of dancing; and, strangely enough, while
most of the womenfolk were convulsed with
laughter, the men listened with immovable
faces. Secretary O. Maidment kept the sur-
prises of the evening in his office. They
were a clock and a decanter-stand. The first
was handed over to the club’s chairman for
29 years, James Clark; and the decanters
were passed to James Harper, another foun-
dation member, and the only vice-chairman
the club has known. Chief-secretary Laz-
zarini made the presentation with grace,
while Mrs. Lazzarini and Mrs. Clark, from
the shadow of handsome wraps, watched
their respective lords with pride. Cecilia
Walsh brought her mayoral cousin; flame-
a nd-gold brocade enwrapped good-looking
Mrs. Maidment; and youthful-looking
assistant-secretary J. Candrick squired his
mother to the party.
Powder and patches, Pompadours aud
Beaucaires, Lady Mary Carlisle's drooping
curls, Marie of France’s hoops and Mrs.
Eddie Horton’s gold Cossack boots were a
few of the features of a glittering night at
the Ambassadors last week. The babes of
St. Margaret's snoozing in their little cots
were the reason of the gathering. But one
reason’s as. good as another for getting into
the attractive gear of a Past which sensibly
insisted that rouge and powder were Every-
woman's toilet necessaries. The architecture
of the underground ballroom and the charm
of old-world billows and languishments made
immediate contact: in the words of the
period, they clicked. The most striking
Beaucaire was the tall Mrs. Jacobson, who
wore her patches with a devastating swagger
and danced with a pretty creature in skyey
blues, who looked as though she was just
taking a night off from Versailles. Hospital-
secretary George Fitzpatrick's lady looked
dignified as Henriette of France, and May
Sheehan made a dainty rogue of a Pompa-
dour, in rose and silver. And like the entry
of some Imperial belle of Bath was the pass-
ing of Mrs. McNevin. One almost saw at
her side a shadowy Beau Brummel squiring
her to her chair.
The Sydney Hospital puts another little
bit in its locker from the Novelty Ball at
the Palais last week. Held on the first night
of spring, it netted a moon that was a
full-blown white rose against a velvet sky,
a wind that was like an icy grip upon the
spine, the State vice-regals and the upper
crust of the Empire Press party—the Burn-
hams, the Astors and Sir Harry Brittain.
The vice-regal box didn’t suffer from any
empty spaces, so Lord Burnham wore a
pleased smile all the evening while his lady
supported gold tissue frocking. Lady Violet
Astor mingled water-melon pinks and ermine,
and the State vice-reine’s Persian blue satin
flew a tunic effect patterned in white jade
beads.
Bishop Taylor Smith, who besides being
Chaplain-General of the British Forces
wears K.C.8., C.V.O. and D.D. after his
name, is over from England, partly for a
holiday and partly to play a hand in the
Church Mission Centenary. In most of the
functions he has attended to date he has
been the star performer, but on Wednesday
afternoon next he will fill only third place.
The two leading parts are to be played by
his nephew, Lieut. Vinton Smith, who won
his M.C. with the IS-pounders, and Connie
Virgoe, who has just completed her nursing
course at the Coast Hospital. The stage is
to bo set at St. James’s, and when the
Bishop has extracted the usual promises the
pair will start housekeeping in Melbourne.

There was an absence of pomp and cir-
cumstance at Mrs. Clive Dangar’s second
venture into matrimony—she became the
wife of Padre 11. K. Gordon, M.C., Yicar
of all Saints’, Glen limes, The marrying
was carried out at All Sajhits’, Woollahra;
the bride’s frocking being a study in ivory
and gold. The dress, a slim silhouette in
honey-toned crepe Itomain, fluffed to a trans-
parent gold lace fulness over the skirt, while
the bodice, bead-embroidered, wore its sleeves
long. A honey-colored crinoline breathing
spring from its clusters of shaded flowers
was the lady's choice in millinery; and an
impressive looking ivory-bound prayer-book
made the perfect whole. By her second mar-
riage Mrs. Gordon, for the sake of her vicar,
forfeits her very handsome share of the Gost-
wyck (Uralla) estate. However, her own
income is not inconsiderable, and, like Cin-
derella, she can go to her parties in her
carriage—one of the latest models in luxuri-
ous limousines.
The engagement of the present Tooth
baronet —Sir Hugh—to Laetitia Florence
Findlay, only daughter of Sir John Findlay,
was lately announced. The present baronet’s
mother, now Mrs. Hugh Warrand, was the
eldest daughter of the Lucas Tooths, and as
the three sons had gone west in or after the
war one of those useful Royal Charters that,
have become the vogue since the war con-
ferred the baronetcy on the new bearer of
the title.
From Brisbane, back at work and play
The bagman who came down in a truck of pigs
from Gympie; the shopgirl earning los., who was
obliged to pay 12s. for transport; and the sorry
tale of the big' shops that were compelled to give
their hands “holidays” because of the slackness of
trade, are no longer features of the times. Eggs
have been reported 4d. a dozen at Lowood, because
there was no way of getting them to the city, and
the wag who cast a bag of over-ripe ones at the
Minister for Mines at Paddington was, after all,
only taking an excusable advantage of the low prices.
Allan Wilkie, who had been prospering in the North,
was stranded at Cairns with his company of 30,
waiting the pleasure of the Railway Unions about
the moving of his scenery, and has been obliged
to cancel his engagements in the south of Queens-
land. Always a man of his word, he felt this sorely.
S’Matthew spread the cloth for the Glyn Connollys,
J. J. Powers, Irma Dearden and Olga Bruclie and
afterwards took the party to the farewell tendered
to his Ex. by the Causeries Frangais at Albert
House. President de Tournouer spoke eloquent words
in his native tongue, and S’Matthew retaliated in
kind. Afterwards there was melody by Mrs. Bur-
stall, Miss Power and Louis Pares. Other insti-
tutions to wave a symbolic hankie and dab their eyes
were the Royal Geographicals, who did it to music ;
the Toowoomba Girls, who said it with an etching;
the Forestry people, who rose to a beautiful writing-
case born from local woods; and the limbless
sailors and soldiers, who handed him a walking-
stick. Finally, some carefree joyriders found
S’Matthew’s private Buick outside the Tivoli and-
took it as a memento.
Amid a setting of sweetpeas. ; gumtips and Ice-
land poppies, an avalanche of printed leaves descended
on the Bush Book Club at an afternoon at the
Women’s Club. Mrs. F. LI. Wedd and Miss Story
hostessed, and secretary Mrs. Firmin McKinnon
looked after the tea-pouring. Mabel Zillman arranged
a very good musical programme and Rhoda Fel-
gate recited.
Architect Lorna Lukin—she is now Mrs. Phillips
—is seeing what Brisbane looks like in September.
The daughter of a Judge and a brainy M.A.
mother, she graduated from Sydney Uni., and has
since been wielding compass and ruler for firms

Manfred put i»p a dazzling performance
in the V.A.T.C. Heattherlie Handicap, nine furlongs,
at . Caulfield on Saturday. Verbius was favorite at
9 to 4, and Ben Olia.tfey’s Valais—Otford colt firmed
from 4's to 5 to 2; none of the other starters, 17
in number, was in nriicli request, although Tookarby
was quoted at 7- to -1. The three-yeai-old, whose
jockey had drawn No. 19 marble—the extreme out-
"side position—gave the starter a lot of trouble, and
was eventually left, losing about six lengths. It
seemed a hopeless case,, hut Duncan went after the
field, and the youngster moved up so smartly that
he was within striking; distance half a mile from
home. He fairly flew
round the turn, and,
getting a clear run
on the rails, cut
down the leaders in
great style, winning by
about a length from
Tookarby, who also
finished generously ami.
beat the favorite by
three parts of a length.
Manfred has been with-
drawn from the Caul-
field Cup, but is now
favorite for the Mel-
bourne Cup, in which
he has 7st. 81b., 41b.
less than on Saturday.
If lie keeps right he
will see a very short
price for the A.J.C.
Derby and the V.R.C.
classic. Verbius, who
carried 1 01 b. more
than his Caulfield Cup
weight (7st. lllb.).
seemed to fade out at
the turn, but San An-
tonio was running on
well in the straight.
The race was run in
lmin. 52Tsec.
T. A. TABART,

the V.A.T.C.
In the Memsie Stakes, nine furlongs, Heroic, a
5 to 4 favorite, drew No. 1 position at the barrier,
with his stable-mate. Royal Charter, next to him.
He showed his usual stubbornness, and had to be
led to the tapes by the clerk of the course. How-
ever, he jumped away well, and was fourth most
of the wav. The Night Patrol (s’s) leading to the
turn. Here Heroic went to the front, and though
Whittier (3’s) challenged him, he won comfortably
by two lengths from the little Woorak horse, with
Spearfelt (10’s), who finished with a great run,
four lengths behind Whittier, and The Night Patrol,
Royal Charter and Fuji San following in that order.
Heroic carried 31b. more than his Caulfield Cup
weight, 9st. 41b., and the time, lmin. slJsee., was
a course record. Punters are sure to take a short
price about Kellow’s chestnut for the big Caulfield
event, but a lot depends on his manners and the
generosity of the starter. Spearfelt’s showing was
encouraging to those who fancy him for one of the
Cups; the Spearhead colt has never looked better.
A rather promising three-year-old gelding in Brig-
adier Bob (All Black—Columbia) easily landed the
Doona Trial, seven furlongs, from Wolla Walla and
Loch Eaton; he was favorite at 3’s. Brigadier
Bob, who is owned by “E. M. Melrose” and trained
by F. Foulsham, may be heard of again-—he cer-
tainly finished like a stayer. He has 6st. 131 b. in
the Caulfield Cup, and 21b. less in the Flemington
two-miler. And imported Friarsdale (9 to 2), now
trained by James Seobie for O. R. Falkiner, gave
Bob Lewis a winning ride in the Warriston Welter,
'•’he English chestnut seems to have come good, as
liandwick watchers predicted he would, and may be
a Caulfield Cup possibility with 7st. 111 b.
The Clarendon (N.S.W.) course looked a
picture on Saturday when the Hawkesbury club held
its September meeting, and those to whom the sport-
ing side of racing appeals more than the business
side found the outing very enjoyable—much more so
than the average proprietary fixture. McShortodds
also appreciated it, for North Berwick (5 to 4), a
rather good-looking four-vear-old bay gelding by
Linacre—Maltstimiy, was the only favorite to bob up.
And he was perhaps lucky to get his head in front
of Yaralla in the second division of the Park Stakes,
six furlongs, for Yaralla was galloping much the
faster at the end, after having been unavoidably
detained. Air Mystery (5 to 4), an Aerofox —Istria
gelding, who was reported to have done a clinking
trial, was beaten out of a place in the first division
of the Park Stakes, which went to Lady St. Aubins
(12’s) ; Chateau Tanunda was defeated by the smart
country mare Orient Princess (7 to 2) in A he
Highweight Handicap, same distance; Avrom (5 to
4) died on a brief, if brilliant, run in the Three-
year-old Handicap, one mile, and was downed by
Knight Errant (20’s) ; the Fortafix mare Lady
Lizzie (12’s) finished too fast for Bowalla in the
Hawkesbury Handicap, 11 furlongs ; and that hand-
some waster Polynesian (2 to 1) cut up badly
in the Rowley Mile, in which Duet (7’s) overtook
and passed the second favorite, Mountbatten, after
the latter bad been lengths in the lead. For the
most part, the well-backed failures were bothered
by the tiring straight, which, though not as long
as the one at Randwick or Rosehill, has an awkward
rise; and some of them may be expected to do better
011 courses like Warwick Farm, Moorefield and Canter-
bury Park. Notably Air Mystery, Algerian Prince,
Avrom and Bowalla.

All going well, Windbag will be seen in
action at Randwick next Saturday in the w.f.a.
Chelmsford Stakes, nine furlongs, won last year by
Heroic, and in previous years by Beauford and
Gloaming. With his 71b. penalty, the son of
Magpie—Charleville has a racehorse’s weight, 9st.
71b., but he has been doing great work on the
track—on August 29 he galloped seven furlongs in
lmin. 27|sec. —and one can’t pick anything to beat
him. • Others nominated are Virgin Gold, Pilliewinkie,.
Valamita, the Queensland crack Admetus, the three-
year-olds Arriounis, Yaals, Hampden and Bravery,
and the mueh-talked-of Maorilander Haze, who is
R. J. Mason’s hope now that Gloaming has gone
wrong again, and who, with 7st. 51b., will have a
great pull in the weights. The meeting in the
Tramway Handicap, seven furlongs, of Valiard (9st.
51b.), Blackadder (9st. 51b.), Boaster (9st. 31b.),
Hit (7st. 51b.), Irish Prince (7st. 31b.) and Baldwin
(7st. 31b.) will be interesting if they all start:
and so will the struggle among Frances Tressady
(9st. 71b.), Wallace Mortlake (Bst. 101 b.), Solidify
(Bst. 21b.), Prince Minimbah (Bst.), Houdini (7st.
61b.), Confusion ,(7st. 51b.), Royal Roue (7st. 21b.)
and Bard of Avon (7st.) in the Spring Handicap,
TO furlongs. Hit or Baldwin may win one race
and Prince Minimbah or Houdini the other.

“Hamer” : That game old lepper, Sundown,
who held the Australian high jump record of 7ft.
94in. until Musician beat it at the Wangaratta
(Vie.) show with 7ft. 10in., will win no more
prizes for his owner, A. Judd. The horse had twice
essayed to clear 7ft. 9in. at the Albury (N.S.W.)
show and was turning to have another try when
lie dropped dead. Judd actually cried over the
body of his 13-year-old champion.

Columns have been written by tennis
experts to show that Australia had or hadn’t a
good chance of beating France in the Davis Cup com-
petition ; cheap stuff most of it. The result may
almost be said to have confounded the prophets and
partisans on both sides, for those who were right
about tiie sequel were generally wrong about the
method in which it was obtained. The idea gener-
ally expressed at this end was that Anderson had
a better show of beating- Borotra than Patterson
had of beating Lacoste. Actually the reverse hap-
pened, for Patterson defeated Lacoste rather easily
(6 —3, 6 —4, 6—2), whereas Borotra accounted for
Australia’s main hope in three equally straight seta
(6 —-4, 6 —3, B—6),8 —6), albeit the loser played with
grim determination in the last. Possibly Anderson’s
defeat was the reason for his standing down in the
doubles in favor of Hawkes, and this may have been
an error of judgment. Anyway, the Australian pair
put up a magnificent fight in a notable match, with
Patterson out-shining his colleague. France won by
6—4, 3 —6, 6 —-4, I—6,1 —6, 10—8 —-even the unpractised
eve will immediately discern that the losers finished
with more games to their credit. With two out
of three, France’s chances looked rosy; it was three
out of 4 when Borotra accounted for Patterson by
4—6, 6—4, 6 —-1, 6—3. Patterson started excellently,
but the “bounding Basque” subsequently out-paced
and out-smashed him. The drizzling rain and
the bad light in which the game was played may
have been a heavier handicap for the Australian
than liis opponent. But one never knows. The
whole contest indicates, more than anything else,
how dangerous is tennis prophecy. It was Patter-
son and not Anderson who proved Australia’s chief
hope, and Borotra, instead of Lacoste, who was
Fiance’s mainstay.

The Ballarat-to-Melbourne road race was
worth £5O to the winner, C. F. Schmidt, a Foot-
seray cyclist, not yet 20, who was on the 34n*in.
mark. A crowd of 5000 cheered his victory, which
was gained after a thrilling finish with A. Williams
(Coburg) and J. A. Tebbs (Malvern). H. K. Smith
(scratch) collected the trophy for fastest time,
4 hours 41sec. Smith, who is just 21, has been
road champion of Westralia, and his brilliant finish,
ahead of such men as Beasley, Opperman and
Osborn, shows him to be a real champion. He makes
his crust as a mechanic in the cycle business.

About 4000 Sydney “sports,” including a
larger-tban-usual attendance in the ringside seats —
reduced, as a result of competition, to 10s., plus tax
—saw the initial appearance at the Stadium of
the Filipino Fernandez, who made good at once.
He is light on bis feet, pretty clever with his
head, and hits very hard with both hands, particu-
larly with the right. He appears, however, to be
weak in the midship section, and during a torrid
five rounds was troubled several times by heavy
body punches. Fernandez scaled Bst. 51b., "and his
opponent, Micky Walker, Bst. 81b. The first round
demonstrated the Filipino’s easy grace and effective
hitting, and a quick finish was anticipated Walker,
however, woke up in the second, and by jabbing lefts
and heavy swings to the body won it and the three
following, though a whirling smash in the third drew
blood from his mouth. Opening the sixth with a
wild attack, Fernandez chipped Walker’s chin with
a glancing right. Michael tried bravely to hide its
effect, but the chip did the business, for he could
110 longer protect himself. Dropped for five, he
got up so groggy that referee Wallis intervened.
Fernandez is only 17.
* * * *
There was nothing brilliant about the
wrestling at the Melbourne Stadium on Saturday. In
the third round A 1 Ivarasick (list. 101 b.) fastened
one of his headlocks upon Yankee lawyer Jim
O’Connell (list. 41b.), aud gained a fall. After
that O’Connell was painfully cautious for a time,
but in the seventh bout he contrived to make it
level pegging by means of his favorite combination,
scissors and facelock, and the match was declared
a draw. There was more excitement in the 12-round
glove contest between Charley Noble (lOst. 101 b.)
and Roy Stewart (lOst. 5;1b.). Stewart had move
tricks in his bag than his opponent, and packed a
harder punch, and in the seventh round Noble took
lessons in astronomy which caused him to lose
interest for a space in mundane affairs. While he
was immersed in his studies the referee pointed to
Stewart.

Queensland went into mourning when the
news came through that its League champions had
lost their first match at Auckland, Maori land scoring
25 to 24. The Bananalanders sadly missed Thomp-
son, particularly in the second half. For Queens-
land Aynsley, the Brisbane winger, got three tries,
and Gorman one, and Craig kicked six goals. For M.L.
A FRIEND INDEED.
HABITUAL PUNTER: “ I owe that chap more
than any man I know.”
CHANE ACQUAINTANCE: “What is he—
owner or trainer?”
HABITUAL PUNTOR: “My landlord.”
Delgrosso landed five goals, and tries were scored by
Avery (two), Saunders, Wetherill and Singe. M.L.'s
success, after having been 14 points behind at half-
time, w T as full of merit.
“Nitric”: Excluding matches in Maoriland, the
Queensland League XIII has in the last three seasons
played 24 games and won 23, scoring 785 points
against 334. Included in this record are eight defeats
of N. S. Wales, one of Victoria, two of M.L. and one
of England. The greatest number of points scored
in one match w’as 74 against Maryborough; the
greatest number in an inter-State affair was 47
against Victoria’s 7.

By accounting for Glebe in the City Oup
final, South Sydney went through the Sydney season
without a defeat. At the interval South led by
10 to 8, and it added a converted try in the second
half-—tiie only score. The premiers have won the
City Cup four times in 14 years; in tw’o other
seasons they were runners-up. Glebe was victorious
in 1913 and has gone down in the final half a
dozen times. Wearing (South) easily headed the
list of point-scorera during the season with 83 points
(13 tries and 22 goals), G. Stettler (West) following
with 65 (5 tries and 26 goals). E. Goddard (Glebe)
got 12 t,ries ; A capital forward, he may help to
regain for X. S. Wales the supremacy it has lost
so decidedly during the last three years.

“E:S.”: A fine record is that of St.
Joseph’s College, Hunter’s Hill (N.S.W.), G.P.S.
champions at Rugby football for the third successive
year. In the seasons 1923-24-25 the “Joeys” played
39 games and won 38, scoring 1466 points to 152.
They owe much of their success to their coach,
Brother Henry, an old Queensland rep. In the
N.S.W. Union team now doing well in Maoriland are
four players who donned the cerise and blue jersey
at school—Reid, Morrissey, Ford and Woods.

The Fitzroy-Collingwood match drew
82,000 people, who left £825 at the turnstiles, to
Victoria Park on Saturday, ’Roy coming out on
top after a strenuous struggle in which they sus-
tained some slight casualties and the Magpies two
serious ones. Latter seemed over-anxious, while the
’Roy battlers were better in the air and quicker to
the ball. Still it was anybody’s game till the last
five minutes, when ’Roy rushed a couple of goals
and won by 99 points to ’Wood's 85. It is 30
years since the Melbourne team played on the North
Melbourne ground, and a lot of people wouldn’t
care if another 30 passed before it played there
again. The Northerners upended the Fuchsias and
spilled them on the soil, and generally turned their
name into Mud, scoring 73 points to Melbourne’s 46.
’Don outed the Richmond Tigers with 74 points to
50, and Geelong collected 103 to Carlton’s ,94.
Also St. Hilda, beat South Melbourne by 75 to
62, and Footscray walloped Hawthorn by 100 to 70.
Next Saturday sees the last set of games before the
“finals.” Geelong is certain of first place, but at
the moment none can say which of the' next four—
’Don, Melbourne, ’Roy and ’Wood—will fill the other
three positions.
“Wink”': Danny Minogue, Richmond’s great fol-
lower and brainiest of Via captains, has retired from
the game. Coming from Bendigo in 1908. Damr
joined up with Collingwood, whose leader he soon
became, and he held that position until he went to
France to do his bit. On his return he went to
Richmond, imparted to the Tigers the Magpie system
with improvements, and made their war cry, “Eat
’em alive,” a real menace. The Tigers gained their
first League premiership in Danny’s initial year as
captain and coach, and next year by a great win
over Carlton repeated the performance. This triumph
was chiefly due to Minogue’s astute tactics; he
nullified Carlton’s superiority in the air by instruct-
ing his men to use only low stab kicks, and worked
out a plan which enabled Max llislop, the Rich-
mond defender, to frustrate the efforts of Clover,
the high-marking Carlton forward. For every match
Danny had a new scheme, and he still retains his
skill as a leader. But as his waistline increased
his play deteriorated, and this year barrackers who
formerly idolised him greeted his efforts with
jeers and ribald jokes. It is a way barrackers have.
“Hamer”: The dapper Davies, who kicked 13 goals
for Melbourne against Carlton (B. 20/8/’25), got
eight of them in the last quarter, thereby making
Melbourne football history. The previous best last-
eti'irt'-r achievement was seven goals—it was registered
by Harold Robertson, of South Melbourne, in July.
1919. Robertson, in that game—St. Hilda, was the
victim—kicked altogether 14 goals, which remains
the record for a Melbourne League match. South
Melbourne scored 189 points—Harry Brereton, the
new Cricket Association sec., contributed 36 of them
—which is also a record. Davies’s 13 goals were
equalled by H. Clover, for Carlton against St. Hilda,
in 1921.
* # * *
As in 1924. Norwood, Port Adelaide. Sturt
and West Torrens will contest the final round of the
Adelaide competition. Norwood won the minor pro
miership by defeating Port Adelaide on Saturday.
Scores were 84 points to 56 (13 —12 to B—B. in
fact), and 19,600 barrackers witnessed the match.
In proportion to population, Adelaide is quite as
football-mad as Melbourne.
* * * *
“O’Ren”: The Burrabig team had just
returned from its annual match at Ninajong, and
was slaking its thirst at the bar. “’Oo won?’
asked the innocent visitor, as he blew bis frotli
aw'ay. “We did,” said the Burrabig skipper. “Stoushed
’em proper. Broke one bloke's nose an’ left ’em
enuff black eves ter see dark at mid-day f’ a month.”
“It was a good go,” said the vice-captain, gazing
at his skinned knuckles. “They give us a run f r
our money.” “D’yer win by much?” said the
stranger as he disposed of his next froth. “Win
by—oh, you mean the football?” returned the
captain. “I dunno about that. We didn’t finish.”
And the stranger called for a third.
» * * *
“Ex-Englishman” : The minor-counties pre-
miership is a sporting English event of which Aus-
tralia hears little. Last season there were 23 in
for it (but this included six second teams from first-
class counties). Northumberland was easily top, but
Berkshire had a right of challenge, and won the
play-off, with the help of Australia’s young friend
Chapman, and Robert Relf, the Sussex international
of long ago. Kidney Barnes, too, the former Test-
match terror, being now 48, has to be content with
this class of cricket; lie is still brisk enough to
have taken 73 wickets for Staffordshire, with the
astonishing average of 7.17. Titchmarsh, of Herts,
and Falcon, of Norfolk, are other men that we have
met on the field.
* * * *
“Remlap”: “Shrewsbury” (B. 23/7/’2o)
is in error in describing Allen, who played for the
Gents, against the Pros., as a Victorian. George
Oswald Browning Allen is altogether a Sydneysider.
He was born in July, 1902, at “Thaxted,” Belle-
vue Ilill, Woollalira ; his father, Walter McArthur
Allen, is the youngest son of the late George Wigram
Allen, for years Speaker of the N.S.W. Leg. Assembly,
and his mother w r as Miss Pearl Lamb, of the well-
known N. S. Wales family of that name. George
was educated at Eton and Trinity College. Cam-
bridge. In the Eton v. Harrow match he carried
his bat through the second innings for 69. A
Cambridge blue, he now plays for Middlesex.
“Hamer”: The Samoans have become so
crazy about cricket that the M.L. Administration
has” issued a prohibition against the game being
played except on Wednesday and Saturday after-
noons. Seeing that a whole village takes' part in
a match, there being sometimes 70 and 80 on each
side, it was necessary to put some check on the
game in order to get some work done. The
Samoan does not use an ordinary bat; something
in the nature of a baseball club serves his purpose.
Usually there is a feast on the occasion of a big
match.
* * * *
“Beaeonsfield”: The candor of Scottish
caddies in expressing their opinion of their employers’
play could scarcely have excelled that of a small
boy on the Manly (Sydney) links recently. After
seeing his employer devastating the scenery leading
up to the first and second holes, for each of which
the score ran into double figures, the frank youth
could stand no more. “Look here, Mister,” he said.
“Yer can’t play golf; yer never will be able to
play. Here’s yer clubs; there’s no charge.” And
off he walked.
* * * *
From his break of 107 on his third visit
to the table, O. A. Shailer, the N.S.W. billiardist,
left no doubt about the destination of the Aus-
tralian amateur championship, settled at the Mel-
bourne Amateur Spoils Club last week. O. Cole-
man, his Victorian opponent, is a good player, though
not quite in Shailer's class. A neatly compiled 81
was Coleman’s best contribution; but Shailer added
a brilliant 116 to his TO7 break, and when lie reached
the necessary 2000 Coleman was only 1317. The
winner will make things interesting for the best of
the English amateurs if, as is likely, lie goes overseas.

“Bill R.”: Good luck and a rifle-shooting
rule that any hole appearing in the target must he
counted a hit, won a valuable trophy for rifleman
E. J. Meaker on the Central Tilba (N.S.W.) range.
To gain the prize he had to register a bull for his
last shot. He fired. When a fleck of dust skipped
off the mantlet, all hands at the mounds declared a
miss. The marker, however, showed the required bull,
and afterwards explained that a stone the size of his
fist had been pelted through the target by the
bullet ricochetting off the earth.

The flowing bowl, you vow, was ginger-ale;
That demon bolder , Rum, you still can block.
Though laurels may surround you like a hedge,
With ribbons blue they’d deck you—-and a pledge!

Shell Motor Spirit was first brought
to Australia in bulk in 1915, and
so made possible the distribution of
motor spirit from the kerbside pump.
By this means the cost of tins and
cases—a heavy tax on the price of
petrol—has been eliminated, and a
saving of approximately 10 per cent,
effected in the motorist’s petrol bill.

Roy Bridges,: one of thfe best-known of Australia’s

connected with the Age for many years ; latterly he
has combined special writing with book reviewing and
dramatic criticism. His historical and colorful pirate
yarns have gained him a vogue in England and
America sufficient to warrant optimism regarding
his future as a writer of romance. His intention at
present is to write a novel or tw'O before leaving Mel-
bourne for New York or London.
There is more money than there are heirs in
the family of Lord Burnham, the smiling man who
used to be Harry Lawson, and is a sort of commander-
in-chief of the newspaper army that is descending
upon Australia for an “Empire Press” conference.
He has no son, and the title will on present appear-
ances go to his brother, and he has only one son.
Lord Burnham’s wife is a daughter of Sir Henry de
Bathe and a sister of the present baronet, Hugo,
who married the Jersey Lily (Lillie Langtry). The
London Daily Telegraph is the family property.
“Two Seas”; The extraordinary success of the
Mirror recalls what, as far as I can learn, was
Sydney’s first woman’s paper— The Lady, published
somewhere about 1890. Its founder was E. D. van
Weenen, an enthusiastic stamp-collector. In the
’eighties, when “Van” was managing old Burburgate
station, a boundary-rider rode in hell-for-leather from
a back paddock with the news that a bushfire was
raging out his way, and immediate assistance was
required. Van was looking through his precious
stamp-album. “Just look at this stamp, Barry,”
■said Van (the boundary-rider was the late J. A,
Barry, who finished up on the literary staff of the
Evening News) ; “I have only just succeeded in
getting a good specimen after trying for years.”
“But what about the fire?” snapped the other im-
patiently. “I’m afraid you’ll have to let it burn,”
replied Van, gazing at him with his soulful brown
eyes. “You see, this is Saturday afternoon, and I
let all the boys go into town.” He was a gentle
soul and was the only station manager I ever met
who never ventured to cross a horse. After leaving
Burburgate, he sold his first collection of stamps for
about £9OO and started the paper I spoke of. Per-
haps not unnaturally, it had a brief and chequered
career.
“Pi” : The first press conference in this country was
held at the beginning of 1803. There is no verbatim
report of it in existence, but it is not difficult to
reconstruct. It was attended try his Excellency the
Captain-General of N. S. Wales, by Mr. George Howe,
lately of the London Times, and by the Governor’s
Secretary. There may have been, and very likely
were, some others present, but these three certainly
were there. Why Mr. Howe had arrived in Sydney
in 1800 as a guest of the Government is not known
now, but since he was such a respectable, decorous,
honest and hard-working citizen, it is pretty safe to
assume that it was on account of some offence that
would nowadays be met by a lecture from a police
magistrate or a small fine. In 1802 he had been
appointed Government Printer —without pay. His
plant consisted of an ancient hand-press imported in
the first years of settlement and a quantity of battered
type and sundries, and the Government Printing
Office was a shed at the back of the old Government
House that Captain Phillip built in 1788. Before
he became Australia’s first newspaper man —he was
editor, editorial staff, reporting staff, father of the
chapel and printer’s devil —he was the publisher of
the first book produced here, “The New South Males
General Standing Orders,” a copy of which is in
the Mitchell Library at Sydney. King describes him
in a despatch as “ingenious,” and it does not seem
to have been difficult for Howe, at the aforesaid
conference, to persuade the Governor to allow him to
issue a weekly newspaper. Accordingly, journalism
began in the South Seas with the first issue of the
Sydney Gazette and New South Wales Advertiser.
on March 5, 1803. The little sheet labored under the
strictest of censorships at the hands of the Secretary,
Government ads. were not paid for, it was almost
impossible to obtain an adequate supply of paper, and
Howe had to make his own ink. He lived for seven
years in what he has himself described as “grinding
poverty.” The mere fact that he carried on at al
puts him in a niche almost higher than that occupied
by the late Lord North'ditfe. It would not be a bad
idea if the doughty pioneer of the Australian Insy
Way were to have his memory honored at one or
two of the functions the British journalists will
attend.
LE MOT JUSTE.
[FOR THE BYLLETIN.]
Miss Preston Stanley’s ‘maiden’ speech—a term
which carried an aptness upon this occasion that
has never clothed it before —was listened to with
pleasure by a sympathetic Chamber and crowded
galleries.”—S. M. Herald.
Winning to Parliamentary estate
Involves a maiden speech, ’tis fairly clear,
Ev’n if you only live to interpolate
A plaintive “Order!” or a brisk “Hear, ho- -”’
But none the less the metaphor may grate
Upon the scrupulous precisian’s ear.
In sober truth, how should a male be able
To make a maiden speech that’s true to label?
A colt may win a maiden plate, of course,
Incongruous as it sounds. I’ve yet to meet
Among the numerous devotees of Horse
Any who reckon it an outre feat
Or stigmatise our language’s resource
In such emergencies as incomplete,
Seeing we don’t possess a way to render
Such things as these without outraging gender.
But here at last was an address conveyed in
The sex’s own inimitable way,
With freshly feminine ideas laden
And gentle coo instead of strident bray.
A maiden speech ? A veritable maiden!
The genuine article —the real McKay.
Something beyond the scope of man the master,
Or even of the matron Lady Astor.
The hour will always bring the man —a thrilling
Axiom I wish to alter and adapt.
How many a phrase false as a pewter shilling
May ring, the while you yearn to see it scrapped,
Until a woman comes to make it filling,
Felicitous, appropriate and apt.
* * * *
I wonder will my bones be corn and clover
Before a spinster bowls a maiden over.

SIMPLICITY and sturdiness are the keynotes of DELCO-LIGHT design.
The plant is built to run and keep running under the most adverse
conditions. It is built for the man who is not an engineer and lives
many miles from the repair shop.

DELCO-LIGHT is a com-
plete electric light and
power plant, and is
made in 25 different sizes—a
size for every need.
It consists of a kerosene engine,
direct connected to an electric
generator which produces
electricity to be either used
immediately in lights, motors,
etc., or stored in a storage
battery or accumulator for
future use.
Delco-Light is not a new and
hastily constructed mechan-
ism. It has been sold in ever
increasing numbers since 1916,
and before it was marketed
years of labor and a quarter of
a million dollars were spent to
develop the plant from a belt-
driven, water-cooled outfit into
a direct-connected, air-cooled,
compact unit.
The Delco-Light Plant of to-
day differs considerably from
the earlier plants. Experience
has shown the wisdom of
eliminating certain features
and of altering others, but it
has demonstrated that the
essential features in the origi-
nal design were correct.
A quarter of a million Delco-Light plants
have been sold to date, and the enormous
output of the factory enables the Delco-
Light Company to produce a quality
product at a price impossible to its
competitors.
Time has proved
the durability of
DELCO - LIGHT
THE ENGINE is 4-cycle, valve-in-head, air-
cooled, self-cranking, runs on kerosene, and is
direct connected to generator. The crank-
shaft and connecting rod are drop forged, and
heat treatment is used where hardness is
necessary. The main bearings are Hyatt roller
and New Departure ball-bearings.
THE GENERATOR is 4-poie,
shunt wound, fitted with carbon
brushes, and has a slotted com-
mutator. A switchboard to con-
trol the current is mounted on the
generator.
THE ACCUMULATOR is a
thick plate, Long Life Battery of
ample capacity. The elements
are in glass jars and the insula-
tion between plates is wood-
board and perforated ebonite.

Melbourne Athenaeum was packed to the
doors for the farewell performances of the
alluring Edna Thomas; and on Saturday
G. P. Hanna’s Diggers came in with a cock-
tail made on revue lines. The Diggers were
assisted by bright girls for whose dances
Rosette Powell was responsible. The swift-
moving show had no dull moments and there
was a merry climax to each part; the final
feature was an amusing presentation of
“Mademoiselle from Armentieres” with Jessie
Hanna as Mademoiselle, Rosette Powell as
Marie, and Clyde Fields as the Digger, rein-
forced by “Chic and Joe in Hospital,” in
which Stan Lawson made the sort of M.O.
that Diggers liked to joke about. Bert Gil-
bert was an orderly-sergeant., G. P. Hanna
(’hie and .Toe Valli Joe. Melody was pro-
vided by the Diggers’ Male Quartette—Jock
Thompson, Ern Hopkc, Clyde Fields and
Brian Lawrence. Altogether a very enter-
taining little show.
“Queen of My Heart,” this week’s bill at
the New Palace (Melb.), conforms more to
the principles of bellow than “The Revela-
tions of a Wife,” which it superseded on
Saturday. In a Japanese setting, Lewis
Fileher (Jefferson Taite) acts the villain to-
wards Kitora San, whom ho has bound by
oath not to betray him; and by throwing the
blame on Charles Fairbrother (of the Royal
Navy) he succeeds in getting their aunt,
Lady Agatha Tonkley, to alter her will in
his favor. Tom Dottle, a merry sailorman
who is Fairbrother’s factotum, helps to turn
the tables on villainy at the, opportune
moment; and the last act, which sees the
“THE MASQUERADER ,” AT SYDNEY
ROYAL.
Wilmington Barnes as the faithful Brock,
and Oliver Bainbridge as Bobby Bless-
ington, a social hack.
whole cast transferred to London, also sees
the complete vindication of virtue and happi-
ness shared to all but the villain and his
companion in evil, Violet Graile. Even as
unabashed bellow the play is not good
material, and it was found necessary to pad
it out with at least one sketch like a revue
item; but the company did passably well,
although Jefferson Taite’s habit of ill-treat-
ing his aspirates is deplorable. Vera Rcmee
was moderately dashing as the adventuress
Voilet Graile, Maurice Tuohy was a manly
hero. Betterton Glover made the money-
holding Lady Agatha the most real of the
characters, Jessie Page was pleasing as Kate
Beresford, Lily Molloy grotesquely exag-
gerated Rose Pink (Lady Agatha’s maid),
Frank Neil provided humor of sorts on broad
lines as Tom Dottle, and Paul Languet and
Yenette Vaughan represented rather uncon-
vincingly the citizen of Japan concerned in
the story. Next Saturday will see something
better: the co. intends reviving “Charley’s
Aunt.”
The remark of the cynical wife in “No, No,
Nanette,” that if you want to keep a hus-
band straight you've got to keep him broke,
still brings a laugh from every seat in the
Melbourne New Princess, and even in the
eleventh week of the run there are no vacant
places.
Marie Burke continues to gather good
opinions at Melbourne Majesty’s, where
“Wildflower” is the fragrant offering. And
with its second and definite parting from
Alf Frith the Firm must be pleased to
notice the solid favor which comedian Gus
Bluett is earning.
In Moscovitch’s fine performance in “The
Great Lover” at Melbourne King's, there
are moments when the greatest heights of
theatrical art are scaled. One of them is
when the voiceless star listens from the door
of his dressing-room to the success his
understudy is making of the part the prin-
cipal has been unable to finish. Every note
of the singing is followed by the listener,
who makes the quivering of his agonised
emotions felt throughout the audience. "The
Merchant of Venice” is posted for Saturday.
The management explains that the great
success of the Clara Butt season in West-
ralia has necessitated a postponement of the
Melbourne opening; the first concert wall be
at the Auditorium on Tuesday next, with
following concerts on Thursday and Satur-
day.
“Within the Law” will fade from the Mel-
bourne Royal after to-morrow (Friday)
night; and the Deity will be asked to put
back the universe and give Wilfred Denver
yesterday when “The Silver King” is intro-
duced by the Muriel Starr Co. on Saturday.
A great crowd assembled to give George
Wallace, who goes to Brisbane, a fine send-
off at the Melbourne Bijou, Amy Rochelle
sharing the regretful enthusiasm of the good-
byes. The Bijou has returned for a space
to a general variety programme-—a well-
assorted bill.
Milton Hayes and Will Fyffe divide the
positions of honor on the Melbourne Tivoli
bill, to which the likeable Ernest Hastings
has returned. Jeannette Gerrard makes pic-
tures ingeniously out of bite of rag—a
unique act. The Iris and Phyllis pair have
not lost their freshness; but, well constructed
though Reg Wykeham and Co.’s “Hubby's
Away” sketch is, it is hardly strong enough
to run into the third w r eek.
At Hoyt’s De Luxe, Melbourne, the ex-
Australian, House Peters, who usually gets
very sound work into his pictures, is the star
of “Headwinds.” “Day-time Wives” is
also on the bill. “The Destroying Angel” is
the best at the Majestic, though “Cheap
Kisses,” with much elaborate setting of
place and circumstance, tops the bill. The
Auditorium is to see the end of “The Hunch-
back of Notre Dame” this week; and the
young violinist Harry Ivlass is earning
money for his studies abroad by appearances
at the Capitol.
The band of amateurs, several of them well-
known Melbourne Repcrtorians, who staged
Barrie’s “Alice Sit-by-the-Fire” at the Play-
house on Friday, did no violence to the charm
of the dainty little play. The production
was in charge of Mrs. Apperly, who was
a convincing Alice; and Alice’s romantic
daughter was capably rendered by Miss
Elizabeth Woodyatt. The son, Cosmo, was
amusingly played by Terence Crisp; Harry
(''handler did quite w r ell as Colonel Gray;
Miss Betty Begg tried hard to make Richard-
son more humorous than it needs to bo;
Miss Leonie Levy was Ginevra; and Miss
Appleton’s nurse can be classed, as the out-
standing feature of the production.

Encouraged by past Melbourne success in
Ibsen, ,J. Beresford Fowler will at the little
Queen’s Hall on September 14 stage Shaw’s

“Doll’s House” is to be repeated on the fol-
lowing Wednesday.

Sundry Melbourne Art shows: —
Alfred Clint is a very successful scenic artist who
is not as successful on the smaller canvases; but
his show at the New Gallery is in the mass pleasing,
and nearly all the pictures will make acceptable
wall decorations. The artist is best in his pencil
drawings; in the water-colors he is matter of fact,
and there is a lack of atmospheric expression which
makes his lines harsh. “Old Shop, W indsor” (No.
1), would be one of the best but for weak drawing
in the shadowed archway; “Sunday” (No. 8) ex-
presses itself faithfully; and in the colored pencil
drawings some “portraits” of fowls and old shops
at Windsor are well done. A few decorative drawings
on silk are attractive, the treatment of color in
“The Blue Plaque” being exceptionally pleasing.
At the Fine Art Society’s Gallery, R. W. Sturgess
shows 41 water-colors. He has ceased to be a
weak follower of Hilder, the present exhibition demon-
strating an increase of individuality and a happier
ease with his medium. “Sunlight After Fog” (No.
3) is a very agreeable picture; so is “The Lone Road”
(No. 12). Both these show at its best the artist’s
search after real beauty. Public appreciation was
markedly shown; some of the red tabs were on
the pictures, indeed, before the show was officially
opened—a fact likely to cause annoyance to picture-
buyers who haven’t had the opportunity of advance
buying.

“Primrose” is blooming so gorgeously at

“Spring Cleaning” will be over at Sydney

If you are looking for “The Lost Chord”
you will find it at Hoyt’s Sydney house;
but it is hardly worth worrying over. The
other picture is “The Spaniard” ; and there
is excitement there. “The Lost World” is
still being explored at the Crystal Palace;
and there isn’t much chance of the shutter
being put up on Rudolph Valentino at the
Prince Edward for a long time yet.

Gus Fowler, Sydney Tivoli’s latest sleight-
of-hand expert, has more watches concealed
about liis person than there are unredeemed
pledges in a pawnbroker’s shop, and he exer-
cises an uncanny influence over their move-
ments. From Scotland comes Neil McKay
with a set of pipes, and he turns the laugh
against the disciples of Moscow and fills in
the rest with quips about his countrymen’s
thriftiness. Harry Green still picks a rich
harvest of applause from “The. Cherry-tree,”
and Syd Moorhouse is making the lyre-
bird jealous with his mimicry. Marie Hurst
sings sweetly and twangs her harp, and
Hooker and Seward are introducing some
local color in their dances.
According to the Gayle Wyer Revue Co.
at Sydney Fullers’, “When the Cat’s Away”
-— meaning the person whose occupation is
termed “Domestic duties” in the electoral
roll—hubby invariably embarks upon a glori-
ous spree. But in this droll little absurdity
he is caught in the act, and the ensuing
skirmish is an enjoyable piece of nonsense.
Paul Warton is back with his troupe of
daring acrobats, and Murfayne, an eager
young man with w’onderfully deft hands, is
coaxing music from a xylophone. Harry
Weldon’s humorous monologues and topical
ditties keep the house quite awake, and John
Moore is getting into the good books of
the Caledonians with his Scotch ballads.

booty an acceptable mansion of his own. That he
has succeeded is manifested by the show of his
pictures which Horderns’ have just unpacked in
Sydney. Bunny’s new domain is where a bourgeois
person c m walk about with profit to his soul and no
danger to his head. Perspective is not liable to
be shot down at street corners, nor are aesthetic
sensibilities subject to persecution by the police. The
true revolutionist is a gloomy and intolerant person,
whereas Bunny succeeds in being gay and spend-
thrift. There is lightheartedness in No. 31, opulence
in the pied fields in No. 45, and real warmth in
the sunshine falling on the quaintly viewed church in
No. 61. You may quarrel with the crossword-
puzzle tree in 48 and the arboreal salad of 13,
but you will find it hard to excommunicate the
emotions which the light, air and energy in the
paintings give you. There is the same hilarious
quality about the pigment in No. 2 and everything
in No. 20 is excitingly alive. The vegetation
crawls across the fields, the cultivation advances
into the hills, and the tree in the centre is resting
after the millionth round with its welterweight
opponent, the wind; before it is too late, the
notice of the Prickly-pear Commissioners should be
drawn to the vigorous growth of cactus in the
•right-hand corner. Bunny has built his new state,
which is ostensibly in France and Italy, on a basis
of sound technique. He has emotion to convey
and does manage to convey it. The spiritual uplift
of his show is quite definitely equal to that given
by three whisky-sodas or a walk at the present
season of the year from Hornsby to Galston (N.S.AV.).
A family affair: —
Bessie B. Chappie and William G. Chappie, sister
and brother, who have a show of oils and water-
colors at Wentworth Court, Phillip-street, Sydney,
are Maorilanders. The brother came to Sydney some
time ago while the sister stayed behind. The
atmosphere of the art metropolis of the southern
hemisphere has not done much for the brother, who
betrays large deficiencies in his technical equip-
ment, although in No. 25, “The Barrowmen,” a
street viewed from above, and No. 24, “The Horse-
shoe Tunnel,” a study made from the rear of a
railway train, he has been enterprising and moderately
successful. His sister, on the other hand, paints
the damp gloom of her native bush and the clear
air that travels at 90 miles an hour through
Wellington with diffident charm. No. 9 is a strik-
ing study of moonlight, rocks and water, and No.
7 is a soothing picture of the last resting-place of
the Maori at Petone. While, incidentally, there are
rents to be collected from the pakeha, the Maori
is likely to go on resting.
Adelaide Royal is doing big business with
“The Lady of the Rose,” though it has tra-
velled a iong way from its Danubian ori-
ginal. For instance, Stigant, who. is now so
funny that laughter, mostly feminine, almost
prevents his lines being heard, has the old
silhouette-cutter’s part that, was obviously
rather pathetic in its inception. The other
chief honors go to Claude Flemming, a com-
manding figure, and the now slim Gladys
“THE LADY.”

“Hamer”: For long-distance theatrical
engagements the Phillip Lytton touring com-
panies, out of which Ward Lyons and the
“Cappy Ricks” play emerged into metropoli-
tan success, are unique. Comedian Peter
Savieri has been with Lytton for 17 years;
and Peter is reckoned a mere newcomer by
the Lytton veterans. By the way, Marion
Willis, Ward Lyons’s wife, is now appear-
ing with the dramatic combination at the
New Palace, Melbourne.
“N.M.”: A musical friend in London
makes the bald statement that “Dal Monte’s
concerts at the Albert Hall were no triumph.”
This, in conjunction with two comments of
the _ London Sunday Times, suggests that
Toti was not such a universal charmer there
as in Australia. Of her Lucia the Sunday
Times wrote: “She sang the ’Lucia’ music
fluently and agreeably without making me
forget the great coloratura singers of the
past.” And of her appearance in the “Bar-
ber” : “Toti Dal Monte sang well when she
had not to act, and acted well when she
had not to sing; but I still could not take
to the curious nasal quality there is in her
voice at times.”
“Topee”: Last Sabbath I heard (pdr
radio) a minister request his congregation
to stand during the performance of the Halle-
lujah Chorus. Why the antics of an insane
monarch unable to keep his seat under the
strain of musical emotion should have been
construed into an act of reverence, and as
such handed down to posterity for observ-
ance, I don’t know. As one who has been
frequently scowled upon for non-compliance
by people w r ho seem to regard attendance
at the Christmas “Messiah” as a religious
rite I would suggest that our musical
societies append a footnote to their pro-
grammes of this oratorio, explaining the
origin of this practice of standing and in-
viting its discontinuance.
“OJB.B.”: The programme of “Little
Jessie James,” referring to Harry Burgess,
indisputably a clever comedian, states that
Burgess “made his first appearance here in
1913 with Kolb and Dill.” An error unless
I am very much mistaken. Kolb and Dill
appeared at Sydney Palace in July, 1904, in
a Weber and Fields skit, “Fiddle-De-Dee.”
The company (known as Henry James’s
American Travesty Stars) included, besides
Kolb and Dill, Winfield Blake, Maud Am-
ber, Richard Goodall and Hugh Huxham,
later of the touring Serenaders. “Hoity
Toity” and “Whirligig” were staged during
the season, but the name of Burgess figured
in neither cast. On June 14, 3913, William
Anderson put on “The Grafters” at the
Palace, with Bert La Blanc as one of the
three comic tramps. Burgess appeared as
Rube Skaggs, and later was seen as Koffoff
in “The Speculators.” But Kolb and Dill
certainly did not stage “The Grafters.” Most
Sydney theatregoers had forgotten them in
1913.
“Hamfat”: Apropos of the report that
“Hamlet” has been played in London by
a co. which encased itself in plus fours,
dinner-jackets, short skirts and spats, a
very ancient actor assures mo that Rignold
THEATRICAL NOTE—“GETTING THE
BIRD.”
did something more difficult. He staged
“Henry V.” in modern clothes. The co. had
arrived but not its properties—the truck
containing them had gone astray. George ex-
plained the situation and urged that the play
was the thing, so the audience agreed to
make allowances. In the result George,
clad in a tophat, frockcoat- and trousers, and
brandishing his walking-stick, dashed into
the breach shouting “On, on, ye gallant Eng-
lislx!” and some of the stout yeomen whose
limbs were hewn in England hid them in
bell-bottomed pants.
“Flaming Youth”: Hollywood miscreants
who have perpetrated a screen version of
“East of Suez” have given it a happy end-
ing. Daisy is depicted as a white woman
who has been tricked into the belief that
she is a half-caste, and in the closing scene
she falls into the arms of her white hus-
band. The Hollywood craze for the happy
ending reminds me of a visit to the flicks
with Bert, who knows something of the
rough side of matrimony. We paced moodily
into the night at the conclusion of a silent
drammer, in which a vile-tempered young
woman, after inflicting every sort of vicious
injury on a much-too-patient lover, arranges
wdth him wdiat everybody feels is an impos-
sible and undesirable marriage. “Struth !”
grumbled Bert. “Call that a happy ending!
Why didn’t they kill the poor bloke?”
“Lud”: The theatrical season just ended
in London has been chiefly re-
markable for a vigorous out-
cry against the sordid sexual
play, of which several speci-
mens have been submitted at
West End theatres. The pub-
lic which is not all West End,
is the arbiter, however, and
hits of the season were regis-
tered by well-knit, homely
pieces, with no suspicion of
sordidness. Longest ru n s
were credited to two comedies
—one American, the other
English of the English: “It
Pays to Advertise” and “The
Farmer’s Wife.” The former,
which was in Australia some
years ago, came off in July
after a run of a year and five
months; the other recently
celebrated its 600th perform-
ance at the Court. Pinero is
still a name to conjure with.
His “Iris” has been in the
bills at the Adelphi, with
Gladys Cooper and Henry
Ainley in the leads, for six months.
“Odd Man”: The bells of St. Paul’s
(Melb.) were set going on a recent Sun-
day in an attempt upon John Reeve’s varia-
tion of John Holt’s ten-part peal of the
Grandsire Triples. The task, attempted
under A. G. Fitzgerald, has been accom-
plished only three times in HO years, and
on the first occasion the performance was
on the light bells only. This was the sixth
attempt of the present bellringers to achieve
the 5040 changes necessary. At the first
attempt, during the church congress, they
succeeded in executing only 2000. This
time, starting at 3.30, the eight men rang
4032 changes; but a mistake in the order of
the coursing led to a stop, and that cut
out so much time that the arrival of time
for the evening service brought the effort
to an unsuccessful end. The pity is that
most of the ungodly (and the godly, too),
being quite uninformed about it, only noticed
the bellringing casually. The ringers project
another effort within the next few weeks,
and should have more attention.
“E.T.”: I once played in a version of “Rip
Van Winkle” in a London suburban theatre
when the title-part was undertaken by Fred
Storey, dancer and comedian of the first
Gaiety company to visit Australia. Storey,
an eccentric genius, was not only the leading
actor, but all the scenery of the production
was from his brush. He was an excellent
scenic artist, and the “Rip Van Winkle”
sets had, he told me, taken him three years
to paint—a labor of love. He was rather dis-
appointing as Rip, but his scenery was
greatly admired. One evening Herbert Tree’s
business representative was in front, and
next night Storey received a ’phone message
asking him to call and see Tree at His
Majesty’s after the show. With great gusto
Fred told me what had happened at the inter-
view. Tree had decided to make “Rip Van
Winkle” his next production, a new adapta-
tion having been specially prepared for him,
and wanted to buy Storey’s scenery. Fred’s
answer was that he would lease the scenery
provided he and Tree played Rip on altern-
ate nights. The arrangement did not come
off.
“Lud”: Londoners have known Robert
Courtneidge, Australia’s old theatrical friend,
for a good while as a manager of the
first class. Now they are finding out that
he is of some importance still as a mummer.
The indefatigable veteran has lately returned
to the footlights at the Savoy, of which he
is lessee, and is giving his favorite character-
impersonation of the quaint old Scotsman,
Professor Peckering Peck, in “On ’Change,”
which he staged in the Commonwealth in the
long ago. Daughter Rosaline, born in Syd-
ney, is also in the cast. The comedy has
been re-written and brought up to date by
H. F. Maltby, author of “The Laughter of
Fools” and a dozen other clean and whole-
some pieces. It has been most favorably re-
ceived.
“Lysander”: Alarums and excursions
among British and Australian (who are
largely British) seamen overshadowed in
Melbourne a cataclysm which nearly jolted
the theatrical world off its axis. There
arrived at the same time on the Tivoli bill
Milton Hayes and Will Fyffe. They were
headliners both, yet....there was only one
headline. The great men read publicity
notices eagerly for one jot or tittle more but-
ter for one than the other; they measured
type with an American point-rule and micro-
meter; the orchestra leader went balder with
anxiety lest the second trombone should give
Milt half a semi-tone more “incidental” than
Will or vice versa. The delicate impasse
was kept very -quiet, but special artwork in
WELL, HADN’T HE SEEN IT?
THE MAYOR OF KIPPERI'S Creek (acknowledging presen-
tation portrait) : “Mr. Chairman, ladies, and gentle-
men, I have to thank you for the very handsome
painting of myself.”
daily-paper ads. whereby the two names
were ranged side by side in identical letters
with identical ornamentation showed the
observant how near catastrophe had been.
“Tasmaniac”: A tombstone in the Sandy
Bay Cemetery (Tas.) is erected to the
memory of John Woodcock Graves. It
simply gives his name, and says that he
died on August 8, 1887, aged 100 years. It'
should have mentioned that he was the com-
poser of the famous hunting song, “D’ye
Iven John Peel?” The hunstman described
in the song was the son of William Peel,
and was born at Greenrigg, in the Cold
Country, about 1776. John Peel had a
romantic marriage. Having fallen in love
with IS-year-old Mary White, he put up
the banns in Caldbeck Church, and when
the girl’s mother stood up and cried “I
forbid the banns. They’re far ower young!”
he eloped with Mary at midnight, and bore
her off to Gretna Green. Years ago there was
a controversy as to whether Graves had
not made a mistake in describing John
Peel’s coat as “so grey” and not pink. Sir
Wilfred Dawson, settled the matter. “I have
seen John Peel in the flesh,” he wrote, “and
have hunted with him. Peel’s grey coat is
no more a myth than himself, for I well
remember the long, rough grey garment,
which almost came down to his knees.” Peel
died in 1854, and his wife in 1859. In
Lattimer’s “Story of John Peel” he relates
that Peel’s son was asked by a patron about
the arrangements for the coming week.
“Weel,” said John, “we can hunt Munda’,
an’ we can hunt Wednesda’. But we can’t
hunt Tuesda’ because we’re goin’ to bury
mother.”
“Lond”: The Hale family is making a
specialty of stage imitations, and it does not
worry over “dog eat dog.” Binnie Hale
made her first big step by a more or less
faithful imitation of her own father, Robert.
The said Robert is just now giving imita-
tions of Grossmith and Joseph Coyne in
turn. In the same piece, “Yes, Yes, Flannel-
ette,” young Sonnie Hale is giving a really
lifelike rendering of Binnie as she appears
in “No, No, Nanette.”
“Hamer” : A grim little playlet. “The Re-
turn,” staged at the Melbourne Playhouse by the
Victorian Postal Institute Dramatic Society,
is founded on a real after-the-war happening
in Poland. In the play a pair of feeble and
nearly-blind Russian peasants, awaiting the
return of their son, who went years ago to
America, fail to recognise him in the wealthy
stranger who comes to them with news about
the boy. They murder him for his money,
and the old man then discovers that the
murdered man is his own son; and as the
curtain falls, the mother, still unaware of
his identity, is gleefully counting the money,
intending to send it to America to bring her
boy back. Miss Gargarevich, the producer,
was the mother (her work was capital), and
George Edwards and Bert Milne, who played
the father and son, were both good. But
“The Tragedy of Man” which supplied the
rest of the programme, was not a success.
A REUNION.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Old-fashioned melodrama; in a modified fovm,
seems likely to come back.” — Sydney daily.
The Villain:
I am the Villain,
Always willin’
To wallow in crimes atrocious,
To steal a jewel
Or feed with fuel
Suspicions of husbands ferocious •
Or lead astray
With “Antic Hay”
The modern flapper precocious.
The Hero:
1 am the Hero, lofty and bold,
Always unbending, stern and cold,
With empty purse, but heart of gold,
The Hero, the gallant Hero! '
I’ll stalk the Villain to his lair,'
Without a ruffle of. marcelled hair!
I’ll lay his devilish schemes all bare,
And prove that he’s a Nero! ■
The Heroine:
The virtuous Heroine am I,
Known to you all as overshy
And unsophisticated ;
But as I strut the boards once more.
I’ll try to be less of a tear-stained bore;
My virtue was over-rated.
The Broken-hearted Mother:
Once more I’ll weep right through a scene—
Oh! where is my daughter Madeleine'?
It’s years and years since she was seen,
Near by the river water.
My darling girl, misunderstood,
A-wand’ring in the lonely wood—•
Or somewhere else, where no girl should—
My daughter ! Oh, my daughter 1
The Stern Father:
Once more I’ll stand
With upraised hand
And curse my wayward daughter,
Then, later on,
When she has gone,
Admit I hadn’t oughter.
But it may be
That she’ll curse me
And love the Villain scurvy,
With one thin shift,
Turn me adrift,
Things are so topsy-turvy.
The Child:
I am the ancient Stage Chee-ild,
Still sobful, sticky, meek and mild,
Hired from a Baby-farmer.
Though birth-control has made me rare,
Without the Child no one will dare
To stage a melodramer 1
The Funny Man:
I am the Man of Fun
(Ha! Ha!),
With ancient wheeze
The “gods” I please
And keep Grief on the run
(Ho! IIo!)
The grief of the Gall-er-ie.
I check the flow of tears
(Ha! Ha!),
With timely joke
All sobs I choke,
The sobs of the little dears
(Ho! Ho!)
The girls of the Gall-er-ie.
The Villain:
I have thee in my grasp once more i
The Heroine :
Oh, monstrous hound, unlock the door f
The Broken-hearted Mother:
Look ! There are bloodstains on the floor!
The Child :
A bad man took my Ma away!
The Hero :
Fear not, sweet child, the dog I’ll slay I
The Funny Man:
Read him these gags, dug up to-day!
The Stern Father:
And tell him I am on the way!
All (in chorus') :
We’re coming back, oh happy time!
Melodrama and Pantomime!

An Unimpeachable Reputation for Security.
The Loans issued by the Commonwealth Government have behind them the security
of all Australia. The whole of the National resources of Australia are pledged to the prompt
and regular payment of interest, and the redemption of the Loans on maturity.
Therefore, Commonwealth Loans enjoy an unimpeachable reputation tor security, and
tens of thousands of Australians have acquired the useful habit of putting money into
Commonwealth Loans. . . . ~
The new Commonwealth Loan is a gilt-edged investment, and it carries interest at the
highly attractive rate of per cent, per annum free of State Income Tax. Ihe Investor has
the option of lending money either for six years, eleven years or sixteen years.
A better investment is not available.
Subscriptions may be lodged at any Bank, Savings Bank or Post Office, or with any
member of a recognised Stock Exchange.
The full amount mav be paid at once, or a deposit of not less than I U per cent, may be
lodged with applications, and the balance may be paid by instalments extending over severa
months in terms of the published prospectus. Interest at per cent, per annum is allowed
from the date on which the money is paid.
Holders of Bonds in any of the first four 4\ per cent. War Loans, which fall due m
December next, are invited to convert their holdings into a New Loan for a further period of
either six, eleven or sixteen years, with the right to interest at per cent, per annum during
the extended period. . . ,
If the holder wants his money back before that period expires, he may, without any
trouble, and on paying only a small fee as Broker’s Commission, sell on the Stock Exchange
at the market price of the day. ... - c
Holders of the old 4\ per cents, who convert will receive interest at 5 2 per cent, as from
the date when thev their applications.
The New Loan is Free of State Income Tax

is the most successful, be-
cause Mr. Weston teaches
his students to DRAW, not
to copy.
Many Weston pupils earn

No notice (except of a hostile character ) will he
taken of communications insu/jiciently stamped.
Name and address must appear on the MSS. No
liability is undertaken re contributions volun-
tarily submitted; and no MS. will be returned
unless stamps accompany.
V.E.: “Release” is so well done that if
the subject hadn’t been done so often we’d have
grabbed it with both hands M.C.D.: Comb your
brains. You’ve got the material, but it’s all tangled.
....Devo: Sorry you’re not a cow. We could send
you to the public pound then for wandering....
R.A.H.: No grip in it... .R.C.H.: Afraid nothing
short of a moving picture could do it.... Dorothy
D.: That sort of thing would have to be done
much better at this time o’ day... .M.H.H.: Rather
thin hominy David W.: An old method and a
poor yarn... .L.P.J.: Don’t know what it means....
N.E.R.: Nothing worth telling... .R.J.M.: Wholly
unconvincing tale... .R.J.E.: Misses, but takes off
the paint... .A.L.F.: Goes weakly with lines tagged
out to make them fit.... Dorothy R.: Terrible....
J.L.H.: Doesn’t strike us hard enough... .F.R.M.:
Loaded too heavily with commonplaces... .8.J.A.:
“Shadowland” is rather stiff and creaky verse that
says nothing worth while. ... G.J.C.: You call it
“poetry,” and your guess is bad. It is wooden
verse which says only the obvious.. . . A.A.8.: Must
go back....l.D. (East Melb.) : Nice verse, but not
quite enough in it....E.8. (Katoomba): It has a
certain vigor, but it is only prose chopped up to look
like poetry... .A.E.C.: Some of the verse is good,
but that sort of extended metaphor grows tedious.
We do not understand the phrase “serge of seas.”
.—C.E.M.: Originality is certainly its strong
point... .A.N.F.: The slaughtering persons must shed
the gore elsewhere P.E.S.: Didn’t make us want
to finish it....G.M. (Cooma) : Not enough in “Kelly
Gang”... .W.A.S.: Unskilfully done.. i. J.M.8.: Not
bad, but not enough marrow... .G.F.E.: No, it isn’t
a “perfect triolet.” The perfect triolet must say
something A.T.A.: No Bellerive: The picture
lacks nothing:—
People scattered in terror
As the huge bear did alight;
The zoo keepers endeavored
To stay the brute’s flight;
Near the brink of a pond
A sensation ensued —-
The grim beast of prey
Was unflrmly lassoed,
He broke from the noose
And upon a keeper did bound,
With fierce open jaws
Hurled him to the ground.
In a moment he’d severed
The wretched man’s head.
When a shot rang out
And the monster fell Dead.
. ...E.B. (Camberwell): The verse is poor and the
ideas don’t amount to much... . A.C.: Chief faults
are a failure to make any meaning clear, bad rhymes
(where there are any) and a lack of anything resem-
bling metre... .W.E.8.; Don’t get near. .. . 11.H.C.:
Clumsy verse to carry an ancient gag... .D.B.R. :
Melodrama drawn out to tedious length. .. .Edwin
W.: Dreary... .Arthur X.: Could be much worse;
still, not up to standard.... Jay F.: Not interesting
enough even to be held up to scorn... .A.C.V.:
Misses.... Myrtha W.: No mirth in it... .E.M.T.:
You manufacture words to eke out your sparse
rhymes... .Niloc: Too thin.... J.R.P.: Not there by
a mile... .M.P. (South Yarra) : The flight is too
weak... .Cecil F.: “Evening” gathers up all the
old properties and sets a commonplace scene. We want
verse like the verse we publish and as much better
is we can get it. Mere formally correct lines about
nothing are useless H.T.W.: Get to grips with
reality. AVhat j'ou send is mostly noisy extravagance.
.... Oliver B.; Whore have you been all this long
time? The conclusion of the “New Selection” is
very striking:—
’Ell! A what an alteration
When one looks across that block!
Well! we've got to make a foundation.
Yes, by gore, an’ look at my socks.
I was just thinking, Bill, jurt thinking,
What the old man will say ;
One eye cocked, the other winking;
“Ah! this is like making hay!”
Yes, it’s all right for you to say, Dad:
But look at my pants, and my under ones;
Well, well, it does look a bit sad,
An’ these are just about done.
Oh yes, all! Well, buck in,
Knock down as much you can;
Next year you’ll bound to win,
And then you’ll be a full-blown man.
. ...U.R.E.; Send it to “Josephine.” If she’s that
sort of lady she may be able to stand it... .E.H.G :
None of them up, but the smaller ones show promise.
.. . .J.T.: Not enough in the wail about the sea....
K.D.F.S.: The struggle after mirth is too furious.
... .C.W.M.: Not much moved by either of them....
J.S.L.: Verse very poor, and the yarn doesn’t catch
the laqghter it chases... .Margaret A.: In the verse
you’ve set yourself too hard a task. The prose is
much poorer... .H.L.K.; No use... .M.E.D.: Both as
thin as the hound of Lazarus... .M.G. (Bendigo):
It made us sad... .C.W.H.: Wooden verse that
preaches a dull sermon. .. .R.R.D.: A bad example
of a poor form... .Bushbird: Might be a lot worse,
but you have still some distance to g0....G.AV.
(Walkerville) : Not well enough done.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
G.H.: Carefully modelled on the style of a well-
known Sydney artist G. 8.: Joke’s an old cam-
paigner and the drawing’s scratchy... .E.T.: Sil-
houettes too crude T.H.: Misses R.A.: One is
unintelligible, the second old and the third under
suspicion. Art has possibilities M.N.: George
Cruikshank disinterred, and much the worse for wear.
.... .H.AV.T.: Cartoon has all the kick in it of a
repatriated Bolshevik in his own country... .T.W.S.:
Fashionplate figures bandying dilapidated old gags
are as prevalent just now as spring catarrh... .C. 8.:
Stirs us like a broadcast kiss. G.G.D.: That ’bus
left a month ago.
“Quiz”: Left high and dry on Middleton
Iteef over a quarter of a century ago, the
iron ship Annasona, now a skeleton, is visible
to mariners passing close to that treacherous
coral islet lying midway between Sydney and
Fiji. Ten years after her arrival she afforded
refuge to a handful of survivors of the wreck
of the barqhe Errol, which, driven on the
reef at night, broke her back, the skipper
and several sailors being killed by the falling
mainmast. When the vessel was breaking
up the survivors set out for the Annasona,
400 yards distant. Sharp coral spikes barred
their way, and the men being frequently
flung bodily on these by the ocean swell, six
of them perished; eight others died after
reaching, their objective. The survivors,
after being without food or water for 16
days, wore ultimately rescued by a passing
steamer.

‘■.Tacky Roo”: “Coota’s” Victoria (B.
20/8/’25) may have its hundred women
estate-agents; but can he produce a hair-
dressing business entirely owned and run by
two women? There was one at Narrandera
(N.S.W.) a few' years ago, and the girls
could “give a man the shears’" extraordinarily
well, too.
“Geo. Rich”: Gould unionism go further
than this? At. a Westralian railway depot
a goods porter, boxing a prize bull-calf,
noticed a loose board on the bottom of the
crate. To prevent the possibility of tin;
prize bovine getting a leg broken lie ham-
mered two nails in the loose board. He
won’t do it again. He has been carpeted and
cautioned for not sending the crate to the
shop—-to have the two nails driven in by a
carpenter.

“Sturt" : Commercial travellers from Vic-
toria, who are numerous in Adelaide, think
that South Aus. is putting the land asunder
God lias girdled with the sea. To get a
line on income earned in S.A. by outsiders
the new income-tax law requires every in-
coming commercial traveller to register, and
later to put in a return as to sales effected.
The visitors complain bitterly about having
to be “licensed.”
*'* * #
“Flaming Youth”: A Melbourne inventor
has added to the Australian list of motoring
improvements what he aptly calls a “cour-
tesy floodlight.” The gadget, adjusted on
the right-hand footboard, on the operation of
a switch floods the roadway with light
thrown downwards, and so gives passing cars
a clear indication of the space they can safely
use. The simple little accessory is likely to
add security to the feelings of motorists,
especially on dark and narrow country roads.
“Seebee”: When Vic. Parliament passed
an Act last year enabling people to whom
money is owing by the State to be paid by
cheque sent from Melbourne instead of hav-
ing to call at a country pay-office, it was hardly
realised what a blow was being struck at
the social life of rural centres. Now it is
proposed to abolish sub-treasuries, and the
officer or officers w r ho helped to give tone
to the places are, to be transferred to Mel-
bourne. Naturally the towns are kicking,
and the adjournment of the Assembly was
moved by Frost, of Maryborough. Shift-
ing of clerks of courts is also spoken of.
That will be the last straw. What will a
country town be without its C.P.S.? Alec
Peacock, as Treasurer, merely pointed out
that £6OOO a year would be saved. It didn’t
seem to trouble him that he would be turn-
ing social somebodies into suburban no-
bodies. He has grown quite callous in his
old age.
* * * *
“Hargo”: That Warrnambool briquette
(B. 20/8/’25) is doubtless one of a parcel
for which a certain J. Braclie was respon-
sible. Brache was interested in the black
coalfields at Coalville (Gippsland) when
work began there nearly 40 years ago ; almost
simultaneously the immense brown-coal de-
posit on the banks of the Latrobc River (now
Yallourn) was discovered. Brache took a
small consignment of the stuff to his native
Germany, and had it converted into bri-
quettes. He distributed his specimens
amongst likely investors and sounded them
about the possibility of a float, but the black-
coal interests were too strong for him, and
the scheme fizzled. W. Britten Harvey, a
London journalist, was then editor of the
Warragul News, and he was a collector of
big spuds or anything else out of the com-
mon. Harvey afterwards migrated to Warr-
nambool, and edited the Standard for many
years. It would be a safe guess that he
handed the briquette to the museum there.

The Speck’s Forestry Department,
following the example of M.L., Vic. and
other re-forestry experimenters, as well as
the advice of the world’s best timber experts,
proposes to include at least 50 per cent, of
Pinus insignia in its plantings. The proposal
is coming in for a good deal of condemna-
tion, mostly from cocky and bush-sawyer
members of Parliament, who have been told
that timber cut from this quick-growing
vegetable is valueless except for fire-kindling.
In reply Forestry Director Irby produces
splendid samples of furniture and other
joinery made from locally-grown p.i., also
reams of statistics and records of scientific
tests and experts’ reports as to the kindness
and durability of the timber. The fact that
the Department now imposes strict regula-
tions and collects royalties from an industry
which has been permitted to murder forest
trees indiscriminately for generations, may
account for some of the hostility evinced
towards details of Director Irby’s schemes.

“Blatant Australian”: A Federal com-
mittee is taking evidence about the sort of
stone that would best be used in building
up Canberra, but no mention seems to have
been made of the deposit of marble,
unparalleled for beauty, variety and
quality, that lies waiting at Benambra
(Vic.), 25 miles north-east of Omeo
and about 150 miles from Canberra. An
Australian sculptor named Charles Sum-
mers discovered it years ago, and unsuccess-
fully sought to interest his countrymen in
its commercial possibilities. The gorgeous
old yellow marble called by the Italians
aritico giallo, the marble used by Phidias
and Praxiteles, lies there in quantity. The
Venus of Milo was created out of this
antico giallo —Rodin, the greatest of all
sculptors, never had the chance to use it.
That particular marble is no longer produced
in Mesopotamia or Egypt; and its very
source seems to have been lost. Here it is
at Benambra unused and untouched. Some
years ago I took samples to London for sub-
mission to leading sculptors and marble
masons. The value and beauty of the stone
were recognised, but nothing has ever been
done—there isn’t even a good main road
from Omeo to Bruthen that would facilitate
operations. The Commonwealth Government
snould employ an expert to tell it about these
deposits.

TT is easy to talk of perfection,
1 but difficult to achieve. For
70 years the name of Loewe has
been synonymous with briar
pipe perfection. It has made
London famous as the home
of the briar. Loewe crafts-
men are proud of having main-
tained this tradition and of
producing “the best pipe of all ”in the
Mother Country. There is no secret in
the world wide appreciation of Loewe
briars. It has been won by sheer
excellence.

WRITE FOR ILLUSTRATED BOOKLET. BOX 555 G.P.O. SYDNEY, N.S.W,
“Six and Eight”: Here is a variant on
the “Maybert,” “Willamy” house-names
(B. 20/8/’25). The newly-weds’ initials
were E. and Iv., the surname 8., so "Ekaby”
the dovecot became. So far it has passed
unrecognised, most people regarding it as an
aboriginal word.
"Shollum”: Charlie Cornelius, aged 73, on
Buigi, a 20-year-old hunter belonging to Mr.
L. Hazlett, won the Hunt Club cup in a
jumping competition held at North Taieri
(M.L.) last month; about 20 horses com-
peted. As a bystander remarked, “Put an
Irishman on a horse and he’ll jump the
Taieri River.”
“11.R.P.”: “Coot” (B. 20/8/’25) states
Prahran is the only Melbourne suburb with
a native name. How about Toorak, Nuna-
wading, Tooronga, Mordialloc, Maribyrnong,
Moorabbin, Ivooyong, Merri and Murrum-
beena, all municipalities or subdivisions
thereof, to say nothing of the half-castes,
South Yarra and Yarraville?
A good and ancient citizen of Victoria is
Mrs. M. Anderson, of Bendigo, who was 11
when she arrived at the then four-year-old
settlement of Port Phillip, and has since
had 83 years in Victoria and 60 at Bendigo.
She has had 17 children ; and seven of them,
including a daughter of 75 and a son of
74, helped to celebrate her 94th birthday
recently.
“Globe”: The most successful debt-collec-
tor in Geelong years ago was a big negro
with a quietly effective method of his own.
He merely sat down on the kerb in front
of the debtor’s house and waited. In course
of time the man and his mission became so
well known that the mere sight of the nigger
on his silent vigil was more prolific of results
than half a dozen bailiffs.
“G.J.8.” : “Hamer” errs in his statement
that the Thermopylae made a voyage from
England to Melbourne in 60 days. No sail-
ing vessel ever put up that record. The
Thermopylae’s fastest trip was in 1868. She
left Gravesend on November 7 and arrived in
Melbourne on January 9, 1869—63 days. The
time was the same as the James Baines took,
14 years previously, from Liverpool to Mel-
bourne.
“Topee”: Chinese merchants must pack
some queer foods for export, judging from a
Macao label just received from a friend
in the Mandated Territory. A fish is
illustrated bearing the remarkable sub-title,
“Friedblackbeans haringhsh.” As the accom-
panying letterpress only extolled the purity
of the firm’s orchard products, my friend
admits there was some curiosity as to what
the tin might contain. This, however, was
not gratified.
_ Governor Stradbroke’s trip to the N. Ter-
ritory last year cost him £l5O of his salary.
Cussen, J., acted for him for a month with-
out remuneration, and was styled “Deputy.”
Then it became necessary to swear him in
as Administrator. In accordance with cus-
tom, half-pay, £l5O, was allotted to Cussen
for the three weeks. When Brassey, who
drew £7OOO as against Stradbroke’s £5OOO,
had to relinquish part of his screw to John
Madden on a similar occasion he growled
like a bear.
“Hamer” : The Geelong Returned Soldiers’
Woollen Mills stand, appropriately enough,
on the very spot where the first sheep intro-
duced into Victoria took their first bite at
the native grass. There were only eight
of them; they were landed at Point Ilervey,
six miles away, and driven to the paddock
prepared for them. When the mill was built
the old mansion occupied by Captain Fyans,
one of the early pioneers, had to be demol-
ished. William Roadknight was the original
purchaser of the land from the N.S.W. Gov-
ernment, and his estate was the first cut up
and sold as “suburban” land in the Geelong
district.
“J.C.M.”: Here in Ipswich (Q.) there
died between August 15 and 22 seven per-
sons aged respectively 85. 77. 82. 83, 86, 75
and 71. To-day (the 25th) the funerals
take place of three old residents —D. W.
Provan (84), Thomas Richardson (90),
Ann Wells (95). My own father, who died
a couple of years ago and was buried at
Blackall, was 81. Six old friends of his, all
over 80, insisted on walking to his funeral.
One of them, John Trindale, an old Barcoo
carrier, has since passed away, aged 90. But
I suppose we’ll still have to put up with the
southern chatter about the deadliness of the
northern climate.
An affluent mendicant was discovered at
Launceston (Tas.) when the police sent to
the Hobart Home for Invalids an old Syrian
woman named Mary Assid, who claims to be
104 years old (the doctors put her between
70 and 80). For 50 years she has wandered
round Launceston collecting rags and rub-
bish. “Mary Patches’s” best asset seemed to
be her indigence, but small coins to the value
of over £5O, fixed deposit receipts for £2050
and £1351, and a Savings Bank book showing
a credit of £5OO-odd were found concealed
amongst her dilapidated raiment. No inter-
est had been added in her Savings Bank book
for ten years; when this was done the total
grew to £729 4s. 3d.
“Forebridge”: The U.S. Admiral’s opinion
that Rio’s claim to be the finest harbor in
the world “only relates to scenery,” and that
Hobart beats it for shipping facilities (B.
27/S/’25), will hardly receive general en-
dorsement from naval men. Considering the
size and population of Tasmania, Hobart is
undoubtedly a well-equipped port; neverthe-
less, I have had to anchor a vessel in the
stream because, half a dozen big ships being
in harbor together, all the wharf accommo-
dation was occupied. Also, Rio has dry-
docks capable of taking most ships afloat,
whilst Hobart has none. It is perhaps hardly
fair to compare the port of a city of mom
than a million inhabitants with Hobart, but
from a naval point of view, with which popu-
lation hasn’t much to do, Rio stands alone. All
the ships of ajl the navies in the world might
lie at anchor there, and still remain in visual
signalling-touch with each other; whilst the
narrow entrance with the half-tide, smooth-
topped, fortified rock in the middle, and the
towering gugarloaf Peak commanding it. pre-
sents a naturally impregnable barrier to any
intruder.

A WAX Finish Denotes Refinement
THROUGH all their centuries the beautiful interiors
of famous European castles and palaces have known
no finish but wax. Perfectly preserved-—the waxed
wood mellows and glows with the years. This same
beautiful finish can be easily duplicated on the floors,
woodwork and furniture of any Australasian home with

POLISHING
WAX
Johnson s Wax is the ideal finish and polish for all your
floors. It will make them beautiful —easy to care for—
they won t be slippery—and will not heel-print. And
Johnson’s Polishing Wax is, by far, the most economical
finish for floors and linoleum. With waxed floors
expensive refinishing is never necessary, for walked-on
places can be easily and quickly rewaxed as worn spots
appear, without going over the entire floor.
The easy way to wax floors and linoleum is with a
Johnson Weighted Polishing Brush. It spreads the Wax
evenly polishes the Floor easily—and is an ideal
floor duster.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
TTIE John 1 Lesley oil syndicate had .put
down a 'tore in strange country.
Old J ack Hawkins, the manager of
the John Wes’&y, had his own opinion about
it. Much boring in strange lands had made
him wise.
“As long,” he said, “as the syndicate has
some money to spend, we hope to get a good
flow.”
“A dry jfcrowd for a dry bore,” said Bill
Steward. ’ “Oil here would lubricate the
wheels of prohibition down south. I’m full
up of tlrfs climate, anyhow.”
“Wham’s that smell?”
Old Jfcick snilfcd the heavy, tropical air of
Lutaiksyiti g|nd sighed heavily.
“Nofv" soi#t of nigger, I expect, Jack.”
“It’s not nigger and it’s not jungle,” said
the old man. “Bill, slip over to the camp
and take a look at those stores.”
“Why? What are you guessing about?”
Tiny manager sniffed again.
“Hurry over. It may be only a pleasant
memory that’s in my nose, but that’s no
Methodist smell.”
The manager strolled over to the bore, and
the curious odor seemed to thicken and in-
tensify.
“What name him smell?” he asked of the
foreman native.
The native smacked his lips.
“Good fellow smell belonga bore.”
Far away between the shining hillocks
.Tack saw Bill Steward slowly returning.
The dull heat hung over the green edge of
the jungle, where the tall trees stood up bke
a wall with brown shadows between. The
bore was down 220 ft.. and the peculiar smell
seemed to come directly from it.
As the manager sniffed and pondered a
noise of voices came from the point at which
the recently-made track emerged from the
bush. He climbed to the top of a hillock and
curved his hand over his eyes.
“What the devil circus is this?”
A number of natives bearing loads on their
backs and shoulders had appeared, and after
them a kind of litter overtopped by a huge
green umbrella. By the side of the umbrella
walked a white man with the regulation
helmet and white clothing of the tropics.
The engine in the little slied sobbed and
grunted, and a native staggered towards it
with an armful of wood; another native was
doing something with a shovel in a gentle
and hesitating way. The sagging belt flopped
and slithered round the pulley. The manager
still sniffed the heavy air.
He had looked again at the new arrivals
and the green umbrella, when a sudden
shout behind him made him turn. The native
was running backwards with his shovel in
the air, as if to ward off a blow ; the flop-
ping belt had slipped off the pulley ; a cloud
of dust and vapor was being forced upward
from the bore. The smell that had been
tormenting old Jack for the last half-hour
seemed to swell in volume and intensity.
The bore burst into sudden fury, hurling
stones and sand in the air; and then with
a gurgling rush a torrent of liquid poured
out and seemed to form a sort of yellow
mushroom eight feet above the surface.
The manager strolled leisurely towards it.
He did not know whether he had struck oil
or not, but he felt supremely happy. The
natives had paused in their flight, and were
regarding the strange phenomenon with a
kind of rapt wonder. Before he came up
with them they had begun to caper around
it with shouts of laughter. All the air was
full of a yellow haze that seemed delicious
to breathe.
“What name-liic tliish fellow?” said old
.Tack, looking curiously at his boots and
observing with interest that he was wearing-
six of them. A shout from Bill made him
turn. Between the hillocks he saw three
green umbrellas. .
Abner Coleman, chief partner in the John
Wesley syndicate, had climbed out of the
chair upon which he had been carried for
eight hours through the jungle, and lifted
his green umbrella the better to take in the
scene. He was a large man and slow, with
circular whiskers round a face that nature
had intended to be genial. His son, a youth
of eighteen, with red hair and many freckles,
walked a little in the rear, but paused when
he came level with the umbrella.
“This is the manager. Tlcil be able to
tell you.” said Bill.
“Hah,” said Abner, clearing his throat.
‘•‘Mr. Hawkins, I believe—our manager.”
“Shfine day,” said old Jack. “Glad shee
you, whoeversh y’are. Mosh estrordinary
thing.”
“What is the meaning of this?” said
Abner, furling the umbrella with a sudden
indignant click.
“God knowsh wha’itish. Come and sliee.
“The man is drunk,” said Abner.
“Disgraceful!” cried the younger Cole-
man in a thin voice.
Old Jack had turned again and was mak-
ing a heavy passage back towards the yellow
musliroom-like flow of liquid that splashed
around the bore.
“What’s up, Jack?” said Bill, running to
the side of his chief.
“Mosh estrordinary thing. Firsli whisky
minesh in the—hie —world.”
“Why, the bore is actually flowing!” said
young Coleman. “I suppose this fellow has
got drunk because of his success.”
“The atmosphere seems remarkable,” re-
plied Abner as he ponderously waded on to-
wards the yellow mushroom.
The natives were dancing madly, with wild
outcries, in the very spray of the fountain.
They no longer laughed, but howled in hys-
terical frenzy.
“Dear me, dear me!” said Abner.
“Mosh estrordinary thing,” repeated the
manager.
“Mosh won’erful, Jack. All drunksh —ole
boy’sh reelin’ too.” Bill had caught the in-
fection.
“Nishe shtate ’fairsh,” said Abner. His
great form seemed to heave, his eyes twinkled.
He poked the manager in the ribs with his
thumb. “Nishe shtate ’fairs. Good man —
hie —Hawkinsh.”
The younger Coleman burst into a fit of
uncontrollable giggles.
“Shtop that noish. Good jokesh—er, hie
—Hawkinsh. Hah ! Hah ! _ Hah ! Good
jokesh. Cansh help laughish.”
His pondei’ous form sank heavily to the
ground just beyond the splash of the spray.
The other natives had now joined the wild
chorus on the farther side of the bore, where
a broad yellow stream flowed down between
the hillocks.
“Shteadish, ole —hie —man,” said the
manager, and sat down by Abner.
“ ’Sail rish, Hawkinsh, ’sail rish. Neversh
had sush fun ’fore. Shbeautiful flow foil —
mosh beautiful.”
Bill was softly singing to himself; the
natives supported one' another in yielding
groups; the yellow fountain continued to
play; young Coleman sat on the ground
with an ecstatic smile on his face, counting
his bootlaces.
“Forsley-shix,” he said with a final nod.

“Forsley-shix on one footsh, sheventy-twosh
on nexht, on’y shishteen on slim all one.
Hurrish and grow up, lil’ bootsh !”
The sun, which had long given warning
of his intention to set, was now resting on
the tops of the trees. Inch by inch he lowered
liis hazy disc through the branches, then fell
altogether out of sight.
The group around the bore had grown
silent. All lolled in easy attitudes, breathing
deeply. The natives, exhausted with their
capers, were asleep on the ground. The sun
had set. In four seconds it was deep twi-
light ; in two more it was dark. The moon
would rise in about two hours.
Nobody was awake to notice how the yel-
low mushroom of yellow liquid shrank. Inch
by inch it crept down ; when the moon looked
over the distant black edge of the eastern
jungle it was barely a foot from the surface.
At that height it stayed, making a gurgling
sound and throwing off flushing topaz
lights.
Abner moved heavily in his sleep.
■‘Beautiful flow of oil,” he said. “Such
a genuine pleasure to meet these fine fellows
in their hour of success!”
A native raised his black head and stared,
wild-eyed, at the group of white men extended
on the ground. Suddenly young Coleman
sat up.
“Oh, I say, pater ! Good gracious, we’ve
been asleep !”
Bill and old Jack opened their eyes at the
same moment; and Abner snorted loudly and
extended his mouth preparatory to returning
consciousness.
"Well, I’ll be sugared !” said Bill.
Jack was on his feet surveying the bore
with a doubtful eye.
“This is the most remarkable thing I’ve
ever struck. The fumes. overpowered us all.
We must look into this.”
Abner sat up, silent and wondering.
“It’s not oil,” said the manager. “Bring
a pannikin from the engine-house. Bill.”
“We’ve been asleep in the moonlight,” said
the high-pitched voice of young Coleman.
“We have." said Jack, “but what put us
to sleep?”
"The flow is not of oil. then?” asked
Abner doubtfully.
“It seems to me like whisky.” said the
manager. “Can’t say yet. but it looks like
it, and it smells like it. Besides. I have a
feeling that I was ; soused last night. The
only thing missing is the headache.”
“What an amazing tiling!” said Abner.
“Not a bad proposition, sir. if my guess
proves right. If it’s whisky it must lx* old
and well matured.”
“But. but.” said Abner—“oh. it's madness
to think of it. Natural whisky flowing from
a bore ! Oh. surely not!”
“Seems mighty like it.” said Jack.
Bill was loping over the hillocks swinging
the pannikin.
“Natural whisky,” repeated Abner. “It
seems too awful.”
“Might be good stuff. We’ll soon, see.”
The natives were now standing in a won-
dering group on the other side, their shadows
looking long and fantastic in the moonlight.
Some waking birds gave a strange cry in
the nearer jungle, and were answered from
a great distance.
The manager half-filled the pannikin and
raised it towards his mouth.
“Here’s luck, anyhow, sir. It can’t be
poison with a smell like that.”
A moment later lie smacked his lips and
looked round with awed solemnity.
“Whisky, sir,” he said. “Old, mild whisky
such as I haven’t tasted since I was in the
North-west Territory of Canada, where they
bring it from Leith and keep it fifty years.
It’s the nectar of the gods.”
lie drank more deeply and handed the
pannikin to Abner.
“Oh. no, no, Mi’. Hawkins! T couldn’t.
That is—l fear—my principles ! Why, this
must contain alcohol !”
“Too sure it does,” said Bill when he had
emptied the pannikin.
“This is worth a dozen oil-bores with a
full flow,” said the manager. “What price
this in Sydney, Bill?”
“On second thoughts,” said Abner, “this,
being entirely a natural product, must differ
from the mere output of the distillery. I
think I will taste it, Mr. Hawkins.”
That afternoon Abner Coleman entirely
removed his circular whiskers. In the even-
ing he told many tales which are seldom heard
in Methodist circles. Before he retired for
the night in the new duck tent which had
been added to the camp, he cheerfully used
the word “damn.” On the following morning
lie got down to business—business that en-
tirely ignored his former enthusiasm for pro-
hibition.
By noon the work which had been sus-
pended was resumed with feverish eagerness.
A dam was to be constructed to save the pre-
cious liquid which was running to waste.
The natural shape of the ground rendered
this particularly easy. Arrangements were
to be made at once for carrying a pipe line
through five miles of jungle to a point from
which mi efficient waggon service might be
maintained to the coast; and Abner was to
leave in three days’ time to make the best
possible deal with a company working farther
to the south to secure every available drum,
tin, cask or bottle which might be expected
to hold oil.
The utmost enthusiasm prevailed at the
workings. The natives toiled as they had
never been know to toil before; the white
men threw themselves into the job with the
eagerness of those who, seeing a fortune
just ahead, are ready to make a last spurt
towards obtaining it. Through all there
swept a current of laughing goodwill and
cheery optimism. They were on the biggest
thing of modern times; no gold-mine had
ever offered such prospects as this long-
stored nectar of the gods that bubbled up
through the earth. Abner had made them
all part and parcel of the syndicate; even
the natives were to have large rewards.
Far down below in the rocky gorge of the
Paitutu stream the boldest and least civilised
tribe in all Lutaikaiti were holding corroboree.
They did so in full warpaint, with gestures
which suggested that they were being bitten
in many tender places by the fiercest sort of
bulldog-ants. ’Their eloquence, which was
punctuated by spear-thrusts into the hot air,
caused them to speak thickly and perspire
freely ; and through the mazes of their leap-
ing and contortions went nude brown women
carrying gourds of liquid, from which the
warriors stooped in turn to refresh their
lips and their rhetoric.
The business of this mad senate had been
proceeding in a similar manner since early
morning, when one of the women had re-
ported the great discovery. A stream of
liquid delight was actually pouring down the
dry rocky channel from the haunts of the
great python—the sacred animal of their
savage faith. They had tasted of this
python's gift doubtfully at first, then with
deep thankfulness and finally with ecstatic
joy. The question now before the meeting
was by what series of splendid murders they
could show their appreciation of the gift.
By noon the debate was at its height.
Every member of the assembly was address-
ing the chair at the same moment ; and the
chairman himself was insisting on disorder
with all the emphasis of his seven-pound
club.
For some minutes the long-drawn wailing
from the rocks above made no impression
upon the enthusiasts; then in some subtle
way the shrieks penetrated the uproar. All
discussion was suspended. With poised
weapons and staring eyes the warriors waited
to discover the meaning of the diversion.
All too soon the cause of the sorrow was
made clear. A procession of naked women
bearing on high their empty and inverted
gourds demonstrated, while still far off, the
nature of the calamity that had occurred.
The gracious stream of the python had
ceased to run!
The chief rose fiercely to his feet and
pointed to the rocks of the python. In rapid
speech he explained that, though the stream
of bliss had ceased to run, some of the liquid
might still remain in the crevices of the
cliff higher up. It was clearly their tribal
duty to seek this treasure before indulging
in murder, head-hunting or any of the lighter
pastimes. The tribe rose to its feet, stamped
on the earth and rushed forward to sacrifice
itself on the altar of public good.
After the completion of the new dam—
a work executed at such speed as no engineer
accustomed to brown labor would have be-
lieved possible—the discoverers of the earth’s
most attractive secret: relaxed somewhat and
save up the evening to taking moderate
samples from the bore. The glad natives
had disappeared to enjoy their dreams ; but
the sturdier white men maintained an un-
broken front of joy under the white stars.
It was Bill who first hoard the voices in
the jungle.
"Niggers there," lie said. “Must be our
own crowd. The wild ones in the bush
wouldn't dare to stir after nightfall."
Nobody else made any comment, though
the voices continued to punctuate the yarns
that Abner was retelling with grotesque im-
provements. The warm darkness was pleas-
ant; the usual night bird made the usual
noise from time to time; an unlighted lantern
lay on the ground at Bill’s feet; young
Coleman was lost in waking dreams of new
patterns in neckties; old Jack was fully
satisfied with the day’s work.
But it was young Coleman who started
from his reverie at the next unusual sound.
"There’s some bally fellow bathing in
the dam!” he cried.
Everybody sat up. There certainly was
a sound of splashing mixed with the native
voices. Jack rose heavily to his feet.
"We must look into this,” he said.
The lantern was lighted and the whole
party followed him between the hillocks to-
wards the noise, which increased as they
neared the dam. The sight that met their
eyes, when the scene actually came into
view, was beyond description. Dozens of
wild warriors were capering about the pool
and dozens of black heads bobbed on the
surface. The glimmer of the light caused
a concerted howl, long, fierce and menacing.
Old Jack took in the situation at a glance.
“Run for your lives,” he cried. “The
spears will be whizzing in a minute.”
The howl increased in volume; the whole
tribe that was capable of movement sprang
erratically to arms. Young Coleman was
well in the lead of the retreat; Bill, with
the lantern swinging, kept abreast of Abner;
the manager, moving heavily, brought up
the rear.
Twice old Jack looked back; and each
time the moving shadows seemed nearer. A
swift calculation told him that it would be
impossible to reach the camp and the rifles
before the pursuers. lie gripped his revol-
ver, bitterly remembering that only two
chambers were loaded, and labored on.
Tears of bitter vexation were in his eyes
as he turned at the bore. The desperate
resolution he had taken called for super-
human will power. Death was thudding
drunkenly through the darkness; there was
not a moment to be lost.
Stooping over the precious rivulet that
ran from the bore, he struck a match. Deli-
cately and without hurry he held it a
fraction of an inch above the liquid. A
thin blue flame flickered like a will-o’-the-
wisp on the surface ; it spread into a flam-
ing circle; with a hiss like a sna he’s warn-
ing it ran towards the bore and down the
windings of the stream.
“Damn you ! Now you’ve got it,” he
shouted.
The maddened tribe, raging between the
hillocks, suddenly saw the object of their
worship, a vast blue, flaming python, hissing
towards them. Not all the gifts of all the
gods could make them face a thing like
that. The howl of their retreat was more
awful than the yell of their advance.
The manager fell sobbing into the arms of
Abner; Bill and young Coleman mingled
their curses and tears. The bore was a
blazing pillar of light shooting up far into
the sky. The burning seemed to increase in
volume, and fury every moment; the ground
about it seemed to crumble and stones and
sand were blown far into the air.
Not all the sorrow of a blighted syndicate
could drown out the small hell that a single
match had kindled. Next day the new
volcano of Lutaikaiti was observed from the
sea and reported by wireless to a wondering
world. But Abner’s circular whiskers were
well grown before he returned to civilisation.;
and he still speaks feelingly of the curse of
alcohol.

MALTESE CROSS
WAX VE/TA/'
They come to you in a neat, easily-pocketed box. They strike
anywhere, hold their flame in the wind and burn longer than their
wooden rivals.
The outdoor man with a pipe to light when the breeze is blowing
swears by (not at) MALTESE CROSS MATCHES.
You should use them too.
