"Down the Harbour,” Again!
The S. M. Herald has, in its turn, tasted the
sweets of our law of libel as interpreted by
a N. 8. Wales judge. The case Anderson v.
Fairfax did not run on all fours with our
own Clontarf action. And the variation
has been useful, as clinching previous de-
monstrations of the iniquity of the law, and
of the inoompetenee of some of our Judges.
In The BuLLETiN-Clontarf case, it will be
remembered, every allegation in the article
which was the cause of complaint was proved
and endorsed by an overwhelming array of
eye-witnesses. But the Judge ruled that the
paper should be tried, not on the particular
article merely, but on the contents of pre-
vious numbers, even though no allusion were
made therein to the subject or point at issue.
The purpose of publication was the thing,
according to Judge Manning. Now, in the
Herald case, it is not pretended that the
statements in the article which constituted
the ground for action were sustained in
every detail. There is no doubt that the
attempts to verify all that was embodied in
the article broke down in several instances.
The reporter had not sufficiently distin-
guished between facts sustainable by his
own observation, and inferences which were
only patent to his own mind. But that the
general purport of the article was made out
and sustained by the weight of evidence,
there can be no reasonable doubt. The
reporter conveyed to the public his impres-
sions that the Andersons’ establishment was
not what it was represented to be; that the
motives of its conductors were not of
unqualified purity; that the boys were
not so cared for as to justify con-
tinuance of public subscriptions; and
that it would be a good thing if the
whole affair could be quashed. There
were evidently sufficient reasons why the
reporter should have arrived at these conclu-
sions. But, unluckily, his perceptive facul-
ties were superior to his powers of marshalling
his thoughts and giving to causes and infer-
ences their due relation. He jumbled up
what he had ascertained with what he had
gathered from ex-parte statements and with
what he had merely inferred, and in his
report failed to discriminate between these
essentially different grades of evidence. To
his mind, apparently, an inference was as
good as a fact, and a personal and internal
conviction quite on a par with a matter
proved by collation of evidence or by ocular
demonstration.
♦ * *
f° these defects in the article, the pro-
prietors of the Herald have primarily to
attribute the verdict which has astonished
he community and deepened the alarm and
uneasiness created by previous interpreta-
tions of the law of libel. Not that the article
as a whole was not sustained in its essential
conclusions, but because opportunity was
a orded for the plaintiff’s counsel and the
u ge to dilate upon the discrepancies be-
ween minor details and minor facts. The
real question to be decided was embodied in
e defendants’ second plea, namely, that the
publication was for the public benefit. Now,
nnS Un ? be conten ded that it is for the
benefit that exaggerated or unsus-
alegationa affectin g any individual
benoflf b ® published - But ifc is for the public
tion . impostures, or misrepresenta-
tmi„ W u hereby moneys intended to support
* charitable institutions are diverted to
frlw i6Ve establishments, should be
tion/ co °* men ted upon. And if representa-
a/d g00d faith - without malice
with honest purpose, and, broadly
speaking, accurate, should contain a minute
infusion of allegations not absolutely cor-
rect, it is distinctly for the interest of the
community that the representations should
be regarded as a whole, and a liberal appre-
ciation of their general import be permitted.
It is obviously not possible for any public
writer, however excellent his intentions, and
however clear his faculties, to assure himself
beyond chance of erior on every detail in
all cases. A reasonable latitude of inference
must be conceded; other wise, to describe or
comment upon any wrong will be to court a
penalty for trying to do the State a service.
Now, His Honor Sir George Innes has been
at the trouble to make a special disclaimer
on this head. After the verdict had been
given, and the Court was about to pass on to
other matters, His Honor offered some cor-
rections of the public report, and stated
“ I did not tell the jury that the article must be
shown to be true ‘ in every particular,’ but that
all the statements declared on, which In their
opinion had not been proved and conveyed serious
defamatory charges, must be proved to be true in
order to entitle the defendants to a verdict.”
Sir George no doubt believed that this ac-
curately defined his utterances, just as he
probably persuaded himself that his sum-
ming-up was free from evidences of a strong
bias against or for the defendants.
♦ * ♦
If His Honor’s idea of what he did and
did not instruct the jury be correct, then the
Herald’s report of the trial was certainly
inaccurate in a degree quite extraordinary,
considering the care with which such
matters are habitually presented in that
journal. For in the report we find the
very instruction which Sir George Innes
disclaims, conveyed not once, or in a single
form, but repeatedly and in a variety of
ways. Thus His Honor is represented as
putting the case in a nett form in these
terms:—
“The question is. Are these statements true?
Are these unhappy boys the means of getting a
good income from the public and giving Anderson
a certain hold upon a valuable property—thus
attributing to him dishonest motives—and were
the boys worked for long hours daily at the
severest manual toil, underfed, ordinary educa-
cation and religious teaching alike neglected, and
enjoying none of the play or amusement necessary
at their age ? Now, are these things true or not ?
Are they made out to your satisfaction ?”
And again
“ If this article had contented itself with saying
things of that kind, pointing out these matters
which you may take to have been proved, and if
these facts, having been proved, there had been
the strongest, the most trenchant, the moat severe
comment and criticism upon the way in which this
institution was conducted, nobody could have
found any fault with it. It would have been the
right unquestionably, and perhaps it would have
been the duty, of a journal such as this to point
these things out. But what is complained of here ?
Mr. Owen says he does not object to general ob-
servations. What he says is: ‘ They have charged
us here with various things to which I have ad-
verted more in detail. We say they are untrue;
we say they were eminently calculated to do us
injury.’ ”
With reference to which the Judge goes on
to remark
“ That is the way the plaintiff presents his case,
and it is for you to say whether these charges are
proved. Some of them may have bun proved,
and, as I said before, the thing has been subjected
—and justly—to very strong animadversion and
condemnation on many points. But it is for you
to say whether these things are proved, and, if
they are not proved, then the plaintiff is entitled
to a verdict at your hands, with such damages as,
under all the circumstances of the case, you may
think justifiable.”
And, once more referring to the different
charges
“ If you think they have not been substantiated, if
you think one or more of them are of sufficient im-
portance to be taken into consideration as serious
charges, then the plaintiffs are entitled .o a ver-
dict, with such damages as you may think proper.
♦ * *
The above are four separate
culled from different parts of Hi« Honor
summing. They are in perfect harmony
each with any and every other, and they all
convey precisely the sense which Sir George
disclaims having meant to convey. To dis-
pel the impression that His Honor did ac-
tually impress upon the jury that every
charge must have been substantiated to
their satisfaction before a verdict should be
given for the defendants, it would be requi-
site to suppose that every one of these four
paragraphs was inaccurate. It seems more
probable that a lawyer ol Sir George Innes’
quality had been confused about what he
actually did say, than that four separate
blunders, each curiously corresponding and
dovetailing, as regards the sense and purport,
with every other, should have occurred in
the report. It is at least quite undisputed
that His Honor, whatever he may have
meant to leave unsaid, did not at any period
of his summing instruct the jury that they
should take a broad view of the representa-
tions in the article, weigh and consider the
general purport, and the ultimate effect
from the standpoint as claimed by the de-
fendants, and not denied to them, of public
benefit. Sir George assuredly did not in-
struct the jury that they were not to split
straws and grope among technicalities and
petty details, but to decide whether, viewing
all the matters comprehensively and in their
mutual inter-relations, the article had done,
the State good service; or that the injury,
due to the unsustained fractions of its re-
presentations, inflicted upon the plaintiffs
had been so considerable as to outweigh the
proportion of benefit conferred upon the
community at large.
• • •
But it cannot be expected that a narrow
mind should be the home of a broad concep-
tion. The law is vague and faulty. Its ad-
ministration depends largely upon the inter-
pretation given to it by such Judges as
political exigencies or the personal prefer-
ences of influential Ministers chance to give
us. This has resulted in most unsatisfactory
decisions. The intention of the libel laws is
that the power of the Press for evil should
be curbed. As the law has been administered
by the third or fourth-rate men whom
accident rather than ability has pitchforked
on to the bench of our Supreme Court, its
incidence has been to paralyse the influence
of the Press for good. Recent rulings have
not only been dangerous to the general wel-
fare by restricting the liberty of the public
Press, but they have been self-condemnatory
in another way. They have added confusion
and uncertainty to a general limitation of
useful privilege. In the Ciontarf-B ulletin
case, it was expressly urged by the counsel
for the proprietors of Clontarf that the whole
tenor of a journal and any part of the con-
tents of any of its numbers, present or past,
might be taken into consideration as afford-
ing a test by which to judge of the intention
in publishing a particular article. The pre-
siding Judge, Sir William Manning, was
at the trouble of consulting the Chief
J ustioe before giving a ruling on this point;
and, fortified by consultation with Sir
James Martin, he ruled that comment
on other portions of the paper was admis-
sible, as throwing light upon the spirit in

which it was conducted. This stands as a
precedent; or, rather, it so stood till the
other day. But Sir George Innes just as
explicitly ruled to the contrary in his ad-
dress to the jury. His Honor’s own words,
us reported, are: —
“ But I must tell you that you must not go by
the general character of the paper. What you
have to consider is the character of this particular
article. And, on the other hand, if a paper wbro
to be charged with libel, and some article were
given in evidence as a proof of that charge, the
article Itself not being libellous, then though it be
brought against them that they are constantly pub-
lishing libels, and that the general evidence is that
the paper is a scurrilous production, that cannot
be any proof that that particular article was libel-
lous. So in this matter the evidence that this
paper is generally conducted on the most cautious
lines possible in no way entitles them to immunity
when they do—by whatever moans It may come
about—publish a defamatory article.’’
In this opposition of rulings, Sir George
Innes certainly shows to advantage agaiust
Sir Wit.dtam Manning. But it is eminently
unsatisfactory that interpretations of law
should fluctuate hack and forward, accord-
ing to the idiosyncraey of the Judge who
chances to hear a case. And it is still more
unsatisfactory that the interpretation should
each time be varied so as to tell against the
chance of a public journal, when speaking
wholesome truth —or printing “wholesome
fun ’’—escaping penalties which may to some
proprietors mean ruin.
* * *
It is surely full time that the Legislature
should arouse Itself to a sense of the danger
which each such case as the last two impor-
tant libel actions brings nearer. As matters
stand, no matter how flagrant an abuse or
an imposture may be, no matter how greatly
the public might be benefited by a bold
arraignment of some “ring” or some im-
posture, no journalist will feel that his duty
is equal to his peril in touching upon the
matter at all. If he make the slightest slip
—or, let us say, an error more than slight, in
Some detail of his allegations—the purity of
his intention and the utility of his disclo-
sures afford him no protection. He must
not only substantiate the tenor of his repre-
sentations, he must prove every iota. If he
be dragged to court and prove every jot to the
last tittle, and have the extraordinary good
fortune, even under these circumstances, to
get a verdict, the scoundrel whose designs he
has foiled may quit the colony and snap his
lingers at the verdict which ordered him to
pay the costs; or he may pass from the
Supreme Court to that presided over by the
Commissioner in Insolvency, and again laugh
in his exposer’s face. But, if the journalist
make good his allegations in the main, but
fail to prove some minor details, he is liable
to be thrust into prison, and, after having
there expiated his zeal for public welfare by
passing twelve months in gaol, he is still
liable to be pursued for costs and damages
by the vindictive enemy whom his public
spirit has raised up against him, and who
has at his disposal the whole machinery of
that law which should be a terror to—not
an instrument of—rascals.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Cobden and Clemencean.
The resignation by English Whigs of their mem-
bership of the Cobden Club has, judging from the
fact that two cablegrams have been published in
Australia referring to the matter, caused con-
siderable excitement at home. One account as-
cribed the alienation of the Whig members to
“ frequent elections of members of foreign secret
Societies.” Another is more specific, and gives, as
the cause of the secessions, the election of M.
Clemenceau, the French Radical. Now, Clemen-
Ceau is one of the greatest men in Europe. While
Gambetta lived, Clemenoeau was his rival—
especially after the sometime patriot and fearless
opponent of the Empire had become rich and
slothful. Since Gambetta’s death, Clemenceau
has been recognised as distinctly his successor, and
only lacking opportunity to become the most
powerful man in France. He is a Radical, deeply
Imbued with the spirit of Socialistic Reform, and
the Cobden Club Whigs flee his presence. The
only surprising thing about this is that there
should have been Whigs in the Cobden Club. The
Whig is a political Dodo—a survivor of a species
practically extinct. He belongs to the reign of
Queen Anne, and his raison d’etre is his sturdy re-
pugnance to the Pope and the Pretender, and his
preference for the House of Orange as against the
Stuart family. The Whig, yielding to the chang-
ing Influence of the times, has figured as a sort of
Reform-and-Liberty-man; and, while the tradition
of successful rebellion lasted, was not nice about
making common cause with the people against the
Court. But the influence of Whig tradition has
evaporated. There no longer lingers even a flavour
of distinction and respectability about opposition
to a Sovereign or a Government as by law estab-
lished. There are Whigs who have become as stiff
sticklers for the Divine right of kings to govern
badly, as is the veriest Tory. But, generally, your
Whig adheres to the idea that a Monarch has no
vested right to rule when his power is antagonistic
to the general welfare; still ho resents altogether
the new-fangled proposition that the domination
of an oligarchy stands on no better ground than
the right of a king when that predominance exists
to the Injury of the community. Your Whig is
quite prepared to admit that circumstances might
justify a nation—or part of a nation—in ousting a
Sovereign, confiscating his revenues and kingdom,
and scouting his claims to Divine installation. But
ho recoils with horror and detestafion at the new
(and infamous) idea of chevying very much smaller
game —to wit territorial magnates, lords of the
soil—on the grounds that the community
suffers by thoir presence and can never prosper
till they be dispossessed —their little kingdoms and
inherited revenues confiscated, their vested (not
even divine) rights disregarded and derided. Now,
a Radical discusses all these possibilities with great
deliberation. And, Just as thd CougrCgatlonalists
commenced by being FreCthitlkcrs and Rational-
ists, and ended by regarding heterodoxy as shock-
ing and disreputable—so the Whigs, who originated
ns revolutionaries and contemners of sacred rights,
now look upon persons who apply the saute princi-
ples to modern institutions as wild and dangerous
desperadoes, with whom it i* neither proper nor
respectable to associate. Whigs are anomalies as
members of a Cobden Club. Cohden was a Radical
all his life, and there is no phrase of scorn and
obliquy which could be to-day applied to Cle-
mexceau which has not been previously hurled at
Cobden, during his long and stormy struggle with
landlordism to procure cheap bread for the people
of England.
Sops for Juries.
In two recent Supremo Court cases, Anderson \
Fairfax and Davies v. Harris, th'.ro has been
brought into prominence a growing custom of
tipping jurymen with the sanction of the Court.
This is an objectionable proceeding; and if the
Judges have as little power as thev seem to have
inclination to put a stop to it, the Legislature
should take it in hand. It must be admitted at
once that the legal provision for payment of jury-
men is altogether Inadequate to recompense well-
to-do business men for the sacrifice of their time
and attention which is involved in attendance to
decide a protracted case. A man can generally
spare a day without serious inconvenience. But
when it comes to several consecutive days, and
runs to a couple of weeks, it is difficult
to say what liberality of payment would
recompense a man with considerable affairs
of his own to attend to. And, on the face
of it, it might appear only fair and reasonable that
as jurymen are attending to the affairs of the dis-
puting parties, the latter are the proper persons to
bear the expense. But universal application of
such a theory would be demonstrably mischievous.
Under such conditions, a poor man could not bring
a case into court at all. Justice is not provided in
the interests of individual suitors, but in the
interests of the community; and the community
should bear the expense, as it indirectly reaps the
benefit of every decision which serves the cause of
rectitude. But it becomes a scandal that jurymen
should find it necessary or convenient to institute
species of “ knock-outs” for increase of remunera-
tion. They only gain their desire, of course, when
both sides consent. But consent may be little
different from compliance with extortion. When
one side has signified acquiescence, the other is
really compelled to follow. Jurymen are but flesh
and blood, and no suitor would without apprehen-
sion stand towards them in the situation of a party
prejudiced in their eyes by a refusal to do the
correct thing as regards remuneration. There is a
moral compulsion in the case, none the less
effectual because it is cloaked by an apparent free
option, and the sooner the matter is rectified the
better. At the present time the practice is
altogether in favour of the wealthier suitor, and
its tendency is to demoralize and corrupt the
occupants of the jury-box.
At the Triangles.
One of the most repulsive features of the old
penal days has been revived in Victoria and in
N.S.W. Flagellation goes merrily on. Scarcely a
week passes but some wretches are marched into a
gloomy looking yard in the Melbourne gaol,
stripped to the waist, bound to a triangle, and
lashed by the hangman with knotted whipcord
until their shoulders present the appearance of a
ripe peach scored with a pin, and the blood trickles
down their backs. It is sickening. Now, a stripling
of sixteen is carried fainting away from the scene
of his punishment and his place at the whipping-
post is taken by a white-haired, broken-down old
man of sixty, to undergo the same infernal torture.
And yet we shudder when the semi-barbarous
Aunameso impale a French officer, or a tribe of
Infuriated savages roast a missionary! “Whence
the occasion of all this abomination ?” you may be
tempted to ask. Does Victorian crime differ from
that of other countries ? Have these wretches
subjected Inoffensive citizens to outrage or dan-
ger? The fact is that the great bulk of those
who pass under the hangman's merciless cat-o’-
nine-talls have to suffer for indecency. As the law
stands in Victoria, the evidence of a couple of un-
scrupulous or abandoned women, or the unsup-
ported testimony of a couple of lisping infants,
may send a man to the triangles. At the Emerald
Hill Police Court, some days ago, on the evidence
of two children, aged seven and five, a man was
sentenced to two years’ hard labour and two
floggings of twenty lashes each, for unwarrantable
exposure. The crime is abominable ; but the
punishment—well, it is simply fiendish, more fitted
for a community of Hottentots than of Englishmen.
So long as the punishment was confined to garotters
and others, who should, perhaps, be made to feel a
little of the pain so light-heartedly inflicted by
them in the way of business, some excuse might
be found for it. But the thing is ever so much
beyond a joke when one or two prurient babies,
wandering where they have no business, or
prompted by childish mendacity, are permitted to
wreck a possibly honest man’s life. For it cannot
be supposed that a man, whether innocent or
guilty, who has once tasted the lash, is much good
for anything afterwards, except to be flogged
again. Instances are constantly cropping up of
men’s suffering the infernal torture of the “cat”
on evidence that should not hang a dog, or for
offences that in England would be met by a few
days’ imprisonment or a fine of five shillings-
That the punishment is not deterrent has been
shown over and over cgaln, by the constantly in-
creasing number of those who come under the
hangman’s hands for correction. As it was said in
England that no legislative attention was likely to
be drawn to the frequency ot railway accidents
until one or two Bishops were killed, so in Victoria
there Is little chance of a repeal of this iniquitous
law until a Cabinet Minister or a prominent Eccle-
siastic has to “ stack his duds” beside the triangles.
There's plenty of flogging in the New South Wales
Criminal Law Consolidation Act.
Whence the First Atom?
At the Town Hall, Melbourne, Mr. T. G. Dunn has
been knocking the theory of evolutldri endways.
We call it “ theory,” for the tlmb lias klmoSt come
when it has emerged from the “ hypothetical ’
stage. “ I might be afraid of the big devil if I met
him, but. If I met one of the little chaps, I think I
could knock the ‘stuilin” out of him,” said a
plucky little Sunday-school ladi The number of
times the “ stuilin’” has been knocked out of this
evolutionary rag doll is beyond counting, and yet
the thing comes up smiling and smirking as
if nothing had happened, or as if being knocked
down and jumped upon agreed with it. Mr. Dunn
bases his objections chiefly on the fact that neither
Darwin nor his disciples have satisfactorily
answered where the first “atom ” came from, and
yet, as an inverted pyramid rests on a point, so the
doctrine of evolution rests on this primal atom. At
one time the great stumbling-block was the “ miss-
ing link ” and orthodox funny men wrote:
“ I once was a monkey, and lived up a tree,
Which nobody can deny.”
Now, however, it is the missing “ atom ” that
causes the trouble. We have no desire to initiate
a controversy on so dangerous a subject; but some
friend should suggest to Mr. Dunn that the diffi-
culty In discovering the first “ atom ” is scarcely
removed by predicating the Creator who made
that troublesome thing. To Mr. Dunn’s question of
“Whence the atom?” the modest Bradlauoh
would probably respond, “ Whence the Creator ?”
There are plenty of really formidable objections
to the Darwinian theory. No one more readily
acknowledged this than Darwin himself. The
odd thing is that lecturers who, to illustrate or
strengthen their objections, might bo expected to
attack the weakest links in the great naturalist’s
chain of reasoning, almost always choose the
strongest—almost always sit on the wrong end of
the evolutionary branch when cutting It down.
The Licensed Victuallers made a show of them-
selves at their meeting on Friday, June 23nd, when
they passed a resolution to discourage illegal
Sunday trading “ by every means in their power,”
after refusing to adopt a clause which pledged
them to one of the most effectual means—
viz., the appointment of a vigilance committee to
co-operate with the police in dealing with vic-
tuallers who habitually break the law. Mr. Cole-
man made a particular exhibition of himself when
he argued that the existing harmony among hotel-
keepers would be destroyed if the reputable and
law-abiding “ banded together ” to expose the
lawless and disreputable. A harmony which is
only maintainable by a passive confederacy
with rascality and low-livers, is scarcely worth
preserving. The Association, however, is very
determined that, although its members need
not be law - abiding, boarding - house keepers
shall. A Mr. Ferguson was very happy on
another theme. There is a sinful barber in his
neighbourhood who, it appears, sells on the sly a
shave and a glass of rum for the small sum of six-
pence. This offence against law and order vexes
the soul of Ferguson, already sore troubled by
the wickedness of boarding-house keepers who
sell liquor without a license, and seduce “well-
conducted” young men, introduced as detectives
to catch them selling, from their allegiance; and so
fill them with beer and joy that they refuse to
swear at all. It is lamentable to learn that the
private detective business has thus failed in the
boarding-houses; but it revives one to observe
that good solid resolutions were passed to call the
attention of the Inspector-General of Police to the
evil ways of the boarding-house keepers. While
the Inspector-General’s hand is in, he may as well
give a trifle of attention to that barber in the
vicinity of Mr. Ferguson’s hotel; and when his
myrmidons are prowling in that neighbourhood, it
might be worth while just to “put up a Job” on
Mr. Ferguson himself, in view of the fact that
that eminent reformer frankly confessed (just
before he brought that scathing accusation
against the barber) that he traded on Sunday
whenever he got the chance.
A strange story is told of two sisters in
Berlin. About three years ago one of these was
engaged to be married; but, on the bridal morning,
became so ill that she could not go to church. The
bridegroom was a desirable one, and he was a fish
who, it seems, had not been easily hooked. Delay
was risky; so the second sister, covering herself in
a cloudy veil, put on the wedding dress and went
through the ceremony. On retiring, she at once
changed her clothes again, and the unmarried sister
has since lived as a wife. The husband has just
found it out.

notify that he has secured extensive premises over

There is a considerable amount of fussing
over the South Australian Art (gallery. This arises
front two causes. (1) The country will not give
good prices for good work. (2) Those wealthy
folks who have money, and present pictures to the
gallery* possess nothing remotely approaching
good tastb, and probably buy per yard or per lb.
Visitors look at the pictures, and obligingly vent
their views in letters to the Press. Then people
feel uncomfortable, and wish Abrahams, Hamilton,
and the other art dabblers who control affairs, had
not begun on trash. Presently somebody comes
along and says the pictures arc beautiful. Then
another prophet arises and values J. A. Upton’s
“ Peasant Girl at the Shrine,” for which the trus-
tees have Just given £350, at 250 shillings—without
the frame. Now, Upton’s picture is no worse than
many of the others. Upton was a photographic
colourist in Adelaide at one time, but, aspiring to
better things, left for the art centres and studied.
Therefore he is too well known among Adehiideans,
who would much prefer the paintings of some en-
tirely strange humbug with a broad palette-knifo
and a new patterned bootjack. And yet Johnson,
M.P., the shoemaker, is about to erect a big block
of buildings, and name it “ Colonial Industry
Chambers.”
Spicer is right after all. Joshua did stop
the sun. At least the Shroud tells us that one of
its staff whilst on the wallaby got to Albury and
“ stopped the night.” If a Shroud man could do
that, Joshua must have been a mighty moan cuss if
he couldn't stop the day.
THE MODERN BALAAM’S CURSE.
All ye with pockets lined with gold
May aye avoid our curse;
God’s priests will welcome to the fold
All those who “ bring their purse.”
What, though your lives in lust and sin
From day to day grow worse,
We have a charn will pass you in,
If you but “ bring your purse.”
With sacred powers, your errors black
Instanter we disperse.
And conscience ne’er allow to rack
Those who do “bring their purse.”
Our laws are few, them we combine
In one just, straight, and terse;
The simple absolution tine
Is t .is—just “ bring your purse.”
Then, gilded sinners, now no more
Useless repentance nurse;
We’ll waft you to the “ Golden Shore ”
Straight on a well-tilled purse!

A bush youngster, the other Sunday, be-
came suddenly ill, and was seen by the doctor to
exhibit symptoms of poisoning. It was subse-
quently found that he had, in his love for music,
swallowed half of his brother’s concertina. Con-
trary to general expectation in the township, there
has been no tune out of him since. His funeral
was Influentially attended by the musical talent of
the district. And up at Rockhampton, also, a boy
has swallowed some green (arsenical) paper from a
•concertina, and has gone to that bourne from
which, &c.
“Wales,” in his speech on the occasion of
the opening of the Royal College of Music, re-
marked, inter alia:— “Side by side with these
scholars will be educated a group of paying pupils,
who think that music is an art which, if worth
-studying at all, is worth studying well. They are,
then, prepared to enter on a systematic course of
instruction, of less severity and continuance than
that of the scholars, but still far removed from the
musical dilettantism of those who, induced by
fashion, not by taste, to study music, make pro-
gress enough to torment themselves and distract
their friends.” This evident dig at “Edidburgh”
gives one the idea that the Hope of the Empire
-possesses a latent fund of humour.
The blacks’ account of the death of Craw-

was galloping after the blacks with his own station
black, when the latter stopped behind to kill an
iguana. The mob of darkies then showed fight.
Crawford had just emptied his revolver firing on
them when his boy came up. Crawford foolishly
punished him for staying behind, and the boy, in
revenge, told the other blacks that the revolver
was empty. The young scoundrel then borrowed
a waddy from the blacks, with which ho did for
Crawi ord with a blow behind the head. Moral:

The reason so many publicans in the coun-
try find their business “ flat, stale, and unprofit-
able” nowadays, is to a large extent explainable
by the fact that “ lambing down,” that fertile
source of the grog-dispedser’s wealth, is gradually
becoming extinct. The shearing body, for in-
stance, is largely made up of married settlers, who
take the opportunity of increasing their small in-
come by this means. These, as a rule, return
cheque-whole, as well as heart-whole, to their
better halves, and thus the rum vampire is de-
prived of a good deal of plunder. In this way, one
curse of the back-blocks is being gradually elimi-
nated.
The new S.A. Education Bill repeals Acts
of 1875, 1877, and 1878. Four and a half hours to be
set apart every school day for secular instruction ;
ach iols may open a quarter of an hour earlier
for reading the Holy Scriptures in the authorised,
revised, Douay, or Lutheran version; attend-
ance at such reading not to be compulsory; no
sectarian or denominational religious teaching to
be allowed. The Minister may allow gratuitous
use of any school-building, out of school hours, to
any officiating minister or approved layman for
the purpose of giving religious Instruction to
children who may voluntarily attend. The com-
pulsory principle is provided for.
The present local habitation of the institu-
tion known ns Auckland University College must
be uncommonly suggestive of the day of small
things. Said the Governor of New Zealand on the
occasion of formally opening it, the other day: “ I
really could not believe, when I was taken into
that barn by Sir Maurice O’Rorke, that I was in a
University at all. I asked where the Registrar
was, and I was taken into what first I was inclined
to think was the scullery —but there I found, not
only the Registrar, but the Professor of Natural
Science, Professor Thomas. Then I asked where
Professor Brown was to be found, and I was shown
into a room which absolutely had nothing in it but
a chair and a table. There was no chemical appa-
ratus whatever.” This last remark of Jervols
strikes us as remarkably rough on Brown.
New rules with regard to house to house
teaching and itinerating teachers .-—Touchers not
necessarily trained may be employed as under.
They must be capable of imparting the rudiments
of an English Education. The mode in which then-
time shall be apportioned to the several families
visited will be determined by the Minister. Sub-
jects of instruction limited to reading, writing,
dictation, and arithmetic. Teacher to supplement
his oral instruction by a systematic course of home
lessons. Remuneration at the rate £5 per annum
for each pupil in average attendance up to a maxi-
mum salary of £100 per annum, plus £10 per annum
for forage allowance. Teachers to keep a record
of the pupils’ attendance and furnish such returns
as may be required by the Department. Text-
books and materials to be supplied on requisition.
Wharton Brooke Jones, formerly an
amateur sculler of Tasmanian fame, butnowTown
Clerk of Maryborough (Q.) recovered £50 the other
day in the district court from one Ravenhill, who
had gone for Jones under the following circum-
stances: Ravenhill, on the 2nd April last, called on
Jones and asked him why he had put about
scurrilous reports about him (Ravenhill) and Mrs.
. Jones denied the impeachment, though
owning up to having the right to advise his sisters
as to where they should visit without Ravenhill s
interference. Then R. having remarked that he
dldn’ believe a word J. uttered, hit out at the
said j. almost simultaneously with his left fist and
a riding whip, which he grasped in his red right
hand. Jones, with a promptness that did him
credit, brought into action his office ruler. Raven-
hill, utterly unprepared for a display of Home
Ruler tactics, thereupon cleared.
It is felt in Adelaide that the unfortunate
Presbyterian parson, G. A. Palmer, has been the
victim of a terrible mistake on the part of a little
girl. It is hard that a young man, respected
on all sides, just starting in life, and, more-
over, engaged to be married, should have to
answer an indictment for indecent exposure,
first at the Police Court, and then at the Cri-
minal Sessions. Public sympathy goes with the
poor fellow, his counsel, and Judge Boucant.
Charlie Kingston, acting as nubile prosecutor, as
usual let his Illogical hot-headedness get the better,
not only of his judgment, but of his common
humanity. Charlie is one of those men who see a
single idea at a time, become possessed of it, and
allow nothing else to have the slightest weight.
Outside the profession, Kingston would be the last
man to make inuendoes concerning a poor devil
in trouble. Anyway, the case against Palmer fell
through, and Kingston is spared the reproach of a
cruel success. Just think of it! The Rev. G. A.
Palmer has had a narrow escape. Had he been
convicted—and how easily might he have been con-
victed had the oath of, say, a hysterical woman
been added to the girl’s story—he might have been
flolilted !
Officer’s Ostrich Farm is near Swan Hill on
the Murray. It has been established there about
eight years. There are now 100 tull-growu birds
on the farm. They are placed in small paddocks
in pairs and are fed artificially on maize, mangel,
and lucerne. The hen breeds twice a year, and lays
about 15 or 16 eggs. These are hatched during the
course of 42 days’ constant sitting, the cock bird
relieving the hen in the duties of hatching. The
crop of feathers is gathered in about every eight
months. The birds are driven into a small space
between two fences, something like the crush of
a stockyard, and whilst secured there the feathers
are out from the outside. The males are very
vicious during the incubating period, and will
not allow anyone near them. The crop of feathers
tor the past nine months was last week unpacked
in the store of Messers. Dalgety, Blackwood and
Co. The feathers came out in fine condition.
Some of them were magnificent specimens, and
quite equal to anything of the kind exported from
tlie Cape. The large white ones were very perfect.

On Monday night an adjourned meeting
of about thirty gentlemen, proposing to form an
expedition to New Guinea, was held at the
Exchange Hotel. The five chief projects of the
expedition were stated to be :—1. To purposely
secure suitable areas for sugar cane. 2. To pro-
spect for gold, minerals, and gems, 3. To test the
capabilities of the island for export, agriculture,
&c. 4. To secure ethnological and other curiosities
and native products and manufactures. 5. To
open up mutually beneficial trade with the natives.
Mr. Morton, who accompanied Mr. Goldie six
years ago in his botanical expedition to New
Guinea, gave an account of his experiences.
Ho had lived in Now Guinea for ten months,
having landed at Port Moresby, the chief mission-
ary station on the South-west coast, a quiet and
well-doing village, with a population of about 800,
and a splendid harbour. The country around the
v illagc is flat. Thence Mr. Moreton pushed on to
Loloko River. After the hilly parts were passed,
the country was open and lightly timbered. The
Loloko River is swift and very clear; it overflows
its banks at certain seasons, and irrigates the land.
The banks are bounded by thick scrub from 20 to
150 yards in broadtth. The land is cultivated in a
very superior manner by the natives, both on the
coast and Inland. The natives are not like the
Australian aborigines, but progressing towards
civilization. They are industrious and obliging,
the women are virtuous and modest. They have
strict marriage laws, are very particular about
land boundaries, and their fences could almost
be called rat-proof, so neatly are they made.
In the event of a European’s buying land, the
whole of the families’ consent, to whom it belongs
has to bo obtained. Even the grandchildren and
cousins hold a communal Interest in the land
nominally held by the head of tho family. The
land is of a rich chocolate, with occasional patches
of black peaty soil. The natives cultivate tobacco,
yams, sugarcane (which they chew, not yet know-
ing the way to crush it), and coeoanuts. All the
natives smoke—women and children, as well as
men; but they will not use the European pipes,
although they prefer colonial dried tobacco to
their own. The chiefs have no very great power
over the natives; they work together, and only
assume their chieftain sway when some great re-
joicings take place. In Port Moresby there are 29
chiefs. The principal trades in exports are copra,
beche-de-mer, and coeoanuta. The natives are
good at driving a hard bargain. There is nothing
to be feared from the natives if you go with a
definite object and keep to it, and don t intertero
with their women. Mr. Morton speaks very highly
of the trust and confidence the natives place in the
Rev. W. G. Lawes. His name is known far
inland, whore he himself has never been. Mr.
Lawes (he says) will do anything in his power to
help legitimate traders. Mr. Morton goes on to say
how he discovered gold in small quantities on the
river bars, but not enough to pay mining tor it.
He also said that stone implements would, when
European cutlery came into use, no longer be
made, and, therefore, would be a profitable invest-
ment. With regard to the telegrams from England
saying that settlements would be allowed in the
portions of the country opposite Torres Straits,
lie says that these portions are the most unhealthy
part of the whole continent. Mr. Morton con-
cluded by advising that any party going to New
Guinea should go as far up country as possible for
the rainy season; that fever and ague were sure to
attack Europeans, but that a well-known remedy
—Epsom salts—proved a most invaluable safe-
guard against it. Ho strongly advises that one
leader and three councillors should be chosen and
strictly obeyed by the whole party. Mr. Martin
also gave some advice, founded upon his visits to
New Guinea with Mr. Chester, and also to the
Solomon Islands, some of which he has explored.
Messrs. Petre, Sheppard, Martin. Powell, Morton,
NIeld, and Gibbings were appointed a committee
to discuss and draw up a definite statement as to
the financial prospects of the expedition.
ON THE TRAMP AGAIN.


PERSONAL ITEMS.
A coincidence. Parkes sails from Sydney
for foreign parts on the glorious 13th of July. Let
us hope that it means the departure from N.S.W.,
for ever and a day, of the bigotry which has often
been the played-out old man’s sole political
capital.
Montague Levy, of Wynyard-square, has
gone home. We haven’t heard what suite of apart-
ments he will occupy in Sandringham House. But
we think we could guess in two tries. We envy
him the gay old time he will have with the Prince
of Wales, whose two princelings he was such a
father to when they were out here. We don’t
know that we envy the Prince of Wales so
much. There will always be something kept
warm in the oven at Windsor for Montague when
he comes back late. It is better to be born rich
than handsome.
Governor Broome, the new Chief of West
Australia, has been laying the flattering unction to
the souls of his subjects that, after all, in the
future, their side of the great insular continent
will thoroughly eclipse the glory of the East. No
one, however, who has even a mere superficial
acquaintance with both sides would venture upon
such a bold statement. Except In a few special
lines, it is hardly possible for the West, from its
physical conformation, to equal, not to say surpass,
the splendid selection of climates, soils, and general
resources to be found in the East. New Broomes,
however, proverbially sweep clean, and this will
no doubt account for the sweeping assertion of
Western vice-royalty.
Marks Hermann, the Melbourne 1400 per
shenter, is, as all the world knows, in trouble again
over a £500 bill. The facts are alleged to be as
follow:—Marks lent a gilded youth £500 and took a
£3000 bill as security. Said bill was drawn by the
aforesaid gilded youth, one C. W. Sinclair, upon
and accepted by Andrew S. Chirnside, a son of the
Werribee squatter, ami endorsed by Uussell King
Hall (for whom the Chlrnsldes bought the Balla-
rat Star, because Hall had saved young Chirn-
side’s life while lion-hunting in South Africa).
King Hall didn’t keep the Stab long—for reasons.
The bill wasn’t met, Hermann has issued a writ
against Chirnside, and old Andrew of that ilk in-
tends to fight the matter out, and yet further
“show up” Mr. Marks, who still worships at the
Synagogue.
There is in Sydney a man who in days of
yore owned an 83-horse power laugh. He went to a
nigger show once, and yelled at a joke of Johnny
Cowan’s—he I ho! he! ha! ha! ha! ho! ho! ho!
gurgle-e-e-e! Whereupon Johnny enquired from
the stage: “Can the gentleman oblige me with a
photograph of that laugh 7" On another occasion
at Bathurst he visited a hall on a public occasion,
and had to be removed from the place by two
policemen. Once more some friends of his invited
him to dinner at their rooms. He went, and—he
laughed. Next morning the landlady put on each
boarder’s plate one of those formally worded notices
to quit which can only emanate from an establish-
ment where peacock’s feathers are found In
Japanese vases over the mantel. But he laughs no
more. Though happily married he is married.
Of the platform efforts of Mrs. Dr. Potts—
or, if you will. Dr. Mrs. Potts—who has been deli-
vering a series of lectures in Auckland, and is
about to lecture in Sydney, some of the local
papers speak in approving terms. But one Journal
“ goes for ” the fair lecturer very straight in
respect to the discourse delivered by her “ to ladles
only," and, while remarking that “she has com-
pletely conquered the Auckland ladles, who, one
and all, firmly believe her to be a wonderful
woman, who knows a great deal, and has a very
happy way of disseminating useful knowledge
amongst her own sex,” asserts that she tells her
auditors a good deal more than it is good for most
of them to Jcnow. The libel law of N.S.W. restrains
us from more particularly referring to the com-
ments of the Free Lance. However, on all hands,
it is admitted that Mrs. Potts is an agreeable and
accomplished lecturer.
When the place where the city of Christ-
church now stands was a flax swamp, a Scotch
blacksmith of the good old classical name of John
Anderson started a small smithy, which was half
hidden among the flax and tall reeds growing
vigorously round it. As the settlement grew and
business became brisk, It was a common sight to
see Mrs. Anderson handling the bellows and at-
tending to the fire, while her husband hammered
vigorously and made the sparks fly, shaping into
use the implements and tools of the early pioneers.
Mr. Anderson is now the proprietor of the biggest
foundry and iron works in New Zealand: he em-
ploys a large number of men: owns whole blocks
of buildings In Christchurch; Mrs. Anderson rides
in her carriage, as she well deserves to do, and
when she meets an old woman on th? way with a
heavy basket of eggs or butter for the market,
she gives her a drive into the town, and as often as
not dp ys the whole consignment, and sends the old
woman home as happy as a lark. This is Chris-
tianity—the real genuine article—and we wish
there was more of It cultivated in our midst.
The man who told us this swore it was
true. In the halcyon days when the illustrious
Pigvote was a member of Parliament, he sported a
black bag, whereon were inscribed the magic
words: “H. H. Cooke, M.L.A.” But when ne
came down to Sydney, after the ungrateful elec-
tors had rejected him in favour of some parliamen-
tary Barrabas or other, the genial Cooke used, on
arriving at his hotel, and handing over his bag to
the custody of the housemaid, or the barmaid, to
ask her to “ cover up the M.L.A., as he didn’t wish
people to see it.” But this kind of thing at last got
wearisome, so Henry Harry after gravely reflect-
ing on the subject, one day mustered up sufficient
moral courage to paste a bit of paper over the
“ M.L.A.”, thus leaving plain “ H. H. Cooke,”
visible to the public. Henry Harry will, when he
goes to hear the poll declared at next general
election, take with him a wet sponge and the bag,
from which he’ll be able to remove, in two seconds,
the sheet of paper that now interposes itself be-
tween him and glory. But even should his old
constituency spare him the necessity of baring his
titular appendix to a carping and envious world, it
is understood that he will be by no means ready to
throw up the sponge.
“ From 1848 until 1852 no backer of horses
(says the London Daily Telegraph) was better
known or more liked upon English racecourses
than “the Bombardier ”—as Admiral Rous always
called Fred. Standish—who had entered the Royal
Artillery full of youth, spirits, and hope, in 1845, to
bid his native land a long and final farewell in
1853. It will be recollected that in that year, so
fatal to backers, a chesnut pony named Daniel
O’Rourke, who had run nowhere in the Two Thou-
sand won the Derby in a sea of mud against one of
the strongest fields ever marshalled at the histori-
cal starting-post. Among the horses vanquished
by Daniel O’Rourke were numbered those two
magnificent specimens of the thoroughbred,
Stockwell and Kingston; nor, judging by the ex-
ample that Stockwell made of the Derby winner,
when they both met in the Doncaster St. Leger,
would it be easy to compute what weight would
have brought them together in the September of
1853. Suffice it to say that the Derby victory of
Daniel O’Rourke drove Capt. Standish forth from
his native land into the unknown wilderness at the
Antipodes, from which he was destined never to
return.” The captain managed to pick up his
crumbs in the wilderness.
When a Governor leaves his satrapy, he is
rarely remembered with feelings of veneration.
Why this should be so especially the case in the
colonies, we hardly know. Perhaps the Governors
we have had have been especially undeserving of
reverence. However that may be, they are now
telling stories in Victoria about their late Gover-
nor, fir George Bowen, which make the good old
fentleman appear in a somewhat ridiculous light,
hey say that he could weep at will. His speeches
—particularly his after-dinner speeches—were all
powerfully pathetic. He appears to have been
aple to transmit this gift of tears to his children, as
when he was leaving Mauritius, the procession
having reached a certain point, he was heard to
say to some of his family. Cry here.” They tell a
story of his weeping at a banquet given him at the
Town Hall, previous to his setting out on a visit to
Europe. After the affair was over, one of the
guests spoke to another in high terms of “ his Ex-
cellency s tenderness of heart. “ Ah, but,” replied
the other, “ he has done that kind of thing before.
When he loft New Zealand he wept copiously. But
unfortunately the hard-headed people down there
entirely misconceived the thing— they thought he
was drunk.”
Two stanzas, alternative to those numbered
17 and 18 in Byron’s “ Ode to Napoleon Bonaparte,”
have lately been discovered in the poet’s hand-
writing. They read thus :—
XVII.
Yes! better to have stood the storm,
A Monarch to the last!
Although that heartless, firolesi form
Had crumbled in the blast;
Than stoop to drag out life’s last years
By nights of terror, days of tears
For all the splendour past;
Then after ages would have read
Thy awful death with more than dread.
XVIII.
A Lion, in the conquering hour!
In wild defeat, a hare!
Thy mind hath vanished with thy power,
For danger brought despair;—
The dreams o. Sceptres now depart.
And leave thy desolated heart
The capltol of care!
Dark Corsican 1 ’tls strange to trace
Thy long deceit, and last disgrace!
Byron showed his sense by omitting such halting
verses. We wonder what daraphool first pub-
lished them.
Sir William Robinson, at luncheon on
the Adelaide Racing Club’s Cup day, indulged in a
considerable amount of “ high falutln” as regards
his strenuous intention of upholding the honour
and glory of sporting matters in general. As a
consequence, he has been dubbed by many as
another Sir Hercules, and of course the Shroud
wades in with the following characteristic moan:—
“ With Sir Hercules Robinson in Victoria, and Sir
William Robinson in South Australia, our racing
powers will have to bestir themselves unless they
wish to be left far behind in turf matters.” Now,
as a matter of fact. Sir William is by nature the
very antithesis of even the most Platonic sports-
man. In fact, Mr. Winkle would be quite a
shining light beside him in this respect,
spite of all the “side” he may put on
at post-prandial racing speeches. If Sir Hercules
is entitled to pose as the Vice-regal Bsau, then
most assuredly does Sir William fit into the place
of the smooth-faced domesticated Jacob. Lady
Robinson, though, by the way, is somewhat of an
equestrienne, and has the reputation of being able
to knock out of time the cutest horse-dealer in a
bargain for a bit of horse-flesh. A somewhat
laughable yarn in regard to this fact went the
rounds in another colony some time back. A
rather touchy old dealer had a horse on view
before “ my lady ” who was going in eztenso into
its various good and bad points. As she was pro-
ceeding with: “And don't you think his quarters
are ?” etc., etc., the old sport broke impatiently
out with: “I tell yer what I think, marm; I think
the bloomin’ resurrection will be around afore I
sells this here prad, if I wait listenin’ to any more
o’ yer higgling," and with that he unceremoni-
ously marched out of the gubernatorial yard.
Old Tom Boyd, whose portrait we gave in
our last issue, and whose fame is now almost on a
level with that of John Davies, is an Irishman,
and was born in 1798—so that, though still hale and
hearty, he has seen the summers and winters of 85
years. He arrived in N.S.W. five years after the
Battle of Waterloo, and in 1834 joined the Hume
and Hovell expedition which started from Appin,
Just to see what kind of a place Port Phillip was.
The plucky little band crossed the Murrumbidgee
at Cavan, near Yass, and at last succeeded after
many hardships in reaching the spot where Gee-
long now stands, but as things were rather dull at
the time, they returned to Sydney. It was during
this time that Boyd swam the Murray, and thereby
earned for himself not only undying fame but
what was better still, a ticket for the recent Albury
banquet. In early life he was remarkable for his
courage and vigour. Hume placed the greatest
confidence in him; and, in fact, the late Mr. Fitz-
patrick, who was one of the explorers, used to say
that, if anything happened to Hume, they had no
one to depend upon to guide them back to civiliza-
tion, except Tom Boyd. Many years ago Boyd
settled as a small squatter in the Tumut district,
and on his slender means raised a large and respect-
able family. Fortune, however, dealt bard with
the veteran, and to-day he does not make quite so
much money as say—an “ Australian cricketer,” or
a retired prize-fighter. His old friend, Sir John
Hay, knew him forty years, but it was Mr. Richard
M Kay, of Tumut, (an American, by the way) who,
at his own expense, brought the hardy pioneer to
the Albury celebration. Messrs. M‘Kay and T. C.
O’Mara are entitled to the credit of bringing for-
ward, at a fitting time, the last of that intrepid
little band who left Appin forty years ago. The
Government, it is thought, will now “do some-
thing” for old Tom Boyd.
Mr. Brennand, whose torpedo, according
to a recent cablegram, is to have an exhaustive
trial at the hands of the British military authori-
ties, is a young Victorian engineer of great pro-
mise. He first brought his Invention under the
notice of the Victorian Government, who recom-
mended him to try Woolwich; the money to enable
him to proceed home and do this was found by an
enterprising and prominent railway man who is
now located in Sydney. Of Mr. Brennand’s talents
the military engineers evidently have a high
opinion, for the Government, in order to retain
his services, have given him a captaincy of Royal
Engineers with special pay. He was accompanied
to England by Mr. Temperley, a Victorian
engineer, who, in addition to high scientific quali-
fications, possesses some diplomatic abilities of
which young Brennaud may possibly be deficient.
Whether the Brennand torpedo succeeds or fails,
one thing is certain—its inventor has made for
himself a name, if, indeed, he cannot strictly be said
to have achieved tha first step in the ladder of
fame. Brennand, who was a pupil of the late
Mr. A. K. Smith, Civil Engineer, of Melbourne, was
always Inventing something, and was a wag withal.
Two washerwomen one day saw him using a theo-
dolite on a Carlton allotment. “ Will yez take me
loikeness, av ye plase?” asked one of the old
dames of Brennand. “ Certainly—stand still while
I fix the instrument. There now—steady. Ah—
hat’s it. Now, don’t move till I co ’ e back.
Thank you.” He went off, and was away ten
minutes, during which he drew a pencil caricature
of a hideous hag. This he carefully enclosed in an
envelope, and, having returned to the allotment
and done a little more bogus manipulation of the
theodolite, he handed the envelope to he old
lady, who had fairly broken down in her efforts to
preserve a sphinx-like steadiness. “ There you are,
madam, at last,” said Brennand; “mind you don’t
open it for a quarter of an hour, or it will be spoilt
by the sun.” Then he shouldered his theodoflte
and cleared. Even now he would rather dodge
one of his own torpedoes in the Yarra than face
the woman whoso “likeness” he took on that
Carlton allotment.
“ Mr. Hornby, the cricketer, seeks to enter
the English Parliament in the Conservative inter-
est.” More power to him! This is what we like
to see. Wo like to see muscle taking its place in
the councils of the nation. We like to think of
calves and biceps struggling with questions of in-
ternatlonal policy. We like to think of brawn
taking the place of brain). And what is more
reasonable? The is the exact place
wherein to educate a budding statesman. There
is the wary play, the dash, the excitement, just as
in the Parliamentary arena. And it is well-known
that all cricketers, after finishing play, or while
they are fielding, exercise their minds in drawing
moral lessons from the vicissitudes of the game,
and make mental notes that are of Incalculable
service to them in after life. Mr. Jack Gardiner,
member for Carlton, Vic- obtained all his dialec-
tical skill in this way. He was a first-class foot-
baller—a captain of footballers—and inferentially
he was just the kind of man the colony needed to
steer it through political crises. Poor Jack I We
were in Melbourne when he was first elected to
represent the Carlton constituency. At first it was
all a joke. The boys proposed “ their Jack ” as a
candidate out of sheer fun. Jack took it in solemn
earnest, and they, in order to carry the joke out,
canvassed for him all through the constituency.
After they had done this for two or three days, they
saw that people took them to be serious, and that,
if the thing were carried out to the end on this
basis. Jack would very probably come out at the
head of the people. And he did. But the boys
were never very enthusiastic about his abilities.
We overheard one of them say, after Jack had
returned thanks from the hustings, “Well, our
Jack would make a bloomin’ fine speaker if he
had anything to say.” At this time he kept a little
clock-shop in Lygon-street. We have dropped in
on him occasionally when passing, and always
found him with a huge Lempriere before him on
the counter “brushing himself up in the classics.”
This was how he was able afterwards to electrify
the House by “ asking the honorable member what
Proteus had said upon the matter 7 ” and such like
unanswerable posers. In course of time, Jack
came to be considered a very learned man, but a
trifle too pedantic. When he started to legislate,
he had to tie his wristbands with string, and now
he is an auctioneer in a first-class way of making
money—which shows what a fine legislative instinct
he must have had. We would like to see a few
more of his sort in Parliament; and then we would
like to die.
A certain much-travelled bush missionary
wields a stinging goose-quill. He used to write to us,
and we still carefully preserve his letters and post-
cards. We subjoin copies of letters signed by him
—it is true that someone may have forged his signa-
ture—and received lately by two country gentle-
men whose well-known bouses, so far as we have
heard, were never noted for inhospitality to worthy
strangers:—“ , Esq. Dear Sir, You must
pardon my humbly protesting against your un-
gentlemanly and unkind treatment of myself
at your station lately. As a preacher (engaged
in a good work) I sought hospitality at. your hands,
but was rudely sent by you to occupy a room,
all but unfurnished, save and except with fleas and
filth, which (viz., said bedroom 7) adjoins the over-
seer’s hut. For nearly ten (10) years I have tra-
velled throughout five of the Australian colonies,
and have received from the rich—as well as the
poor—the greatest kindness and hospitality. From
Denlliquln to Wagga I only received contributions
from two stations; although my expenses were
heavy, as I am aided by no society. You will see
therefore that I have a very uphill struggle, and
many difficulties and obstacles to contend with.
Surely, therefore, the least you could have done
was simply to do what the majority of other
squatters and land owners in the colonies have
done—viz., extend to myself the same courtesy,
civility, and hospitality in your man house, as these
gentlemen have done in theirs. Your position as a
rich man demands that you should endea vour to
act in a gentlemanly, kind, civil, and courteous
manner to all strangers; particularly to those who,
like myself, are ‘goingabout doing good ’ amongst
the bush people. What kind of attention do you
think would your men have extended to my
addresses in their hut had they known at the time
I addressed them that you had grossly insulted me
by imperiously and rudely ordering me away to
occupy a room not fit for a drunken blackfellow to
sleep in 7 I have prayed to God that he will forgive
you, for I have never known any one who has been
rude or Inhospitable to myself as a preacher, ever
continuing long to prosper, or upon whom the hand
of Ood did not fall very soon thereafter with crush-
weight and heavy punishment. I pray to God
once more that he will forgive your pride (purse
pride is the worst of all pride), rudeness, inhuman-
ity, inhospitality, and injustice towards myself,
and I remain your obedt. Servt., ,
Bush Missionary. Wagga Wagga, Tuesday evening.
P.S.—Should you wish to apologise to me (and I
think you ought to do so at once by letter) please ad-
dress to me at Box —, General Post Office, Sydney.”
Again (to the son-in-law of the recipient of the
foregoing):—“ Steyne’s Metropolitan Hotel, Cobar,
38th May. 1883. Memo. To Mr. . Sir, I was
not aware when I called at your station that you
were related to Lord Brooknong ! I! I only recently
ascertained it. I stand in awe accordingly I That
Gent, treated me in an arrogant (and in what I
deemed to be a rude and inhospitable) manner. I
remonstrated and protested by letter, just that and
nothing more. This did not justify your paltry and
mean inhospitality to me by refusing to entertain
me: much less did it justify your sending a mess-
age (by a half-witted simpleton) that 1 was welcome
if I liked to go to your men’s hut. That no doubt
would be a very suitable place for yourself and the
aforesaid ‘ kill-yore ’ {!) but not for one who is
your superior, not only in birth and education, but
also in manliness, pluck and courtesy. I camped
with my horses in your paddock about half a mile
from your parlour. The night was cold, but your
dead wood made an excellent tire. It crackled and
laughed, and so did my horses and myself. We
had a jolly time of it. .”
John William Colenso has “passed in his
checks.” He was very good to humanity, he was.
He was born in 1814. In 1838, Cambridge hailed him
as second wrangler and Smith’s prizeman. From
college he went as an assistant master to Harrow;
from Harrow he went into Norfolk as rector of
Forncett, St. Mary; from Norfolk he went (in ’54)
as Bishop to Natal, there to meet whom Bishop
Thlrlwalf called the “fatal Zulu.” The result of
this meeting was “The Pentateuch” (published
October, ’63); and the result of “ The Pentateuch ”
was a declaration of English Bishops, in Convoca-
tion assembled, that the said book contained errors
of the gravest and most dangerous character. The
prelates, having purred condemnation of Colenso’s
plausible absurdities,” the lesser lights (or
glooms?) of British orthodoxy wiied in at John
William, mainly after the following fashion:—
An arithmetic teacher of Gospel no preacher.
Worked on with his ruler and pen so,
That, bound in red tape, he was sent to the Cape
As Bishop John William Colenso.
But his fondness for figures was fat 1
To teaching the people of Natal,
For early and late
Making sums on a state
Couldn’t make any Christians in Natal.
And besides British orthodoxy, Colenso had to
take Cape orthodoxy into account. Gray, Bishop
of Capetown, his metropolitan, deposed him in ’64.
Thereupon Colenso appealed to the Privy Council:
result, Gray’s proceedings declared to be null and
void. Gray’s next step was to excommunicate
Colenso, which he did in his cathedral at Maritz-
burg in 1866. Despite all this opposition and
calumny, Colenso was doing the work of a whole-
some missioner in Natal. What “ doxy ” it was he
cottoned to is a small question beside the work
(larger than any credaf conundrum) which he
wrought manfully and patiently and “ blow ’Tessly
during nigh thirty long years. The best defence of
Colenso’s work is to be found in that glorious
speech of Arthur P. Stanley’s (spoken some year
or so ago amid bootings and derision at a meeting
of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel)—
a speech tha,t contained these words:—“I know
that everything I say will be received with ridicule
and contumely; nevertheless, I say that long after
we are dead and buried his (Colenso’s) memory
will be treasured as that of the one missionary
bishop in South Africa who translated the Scrip-
tures into the language of the tribes to which he
was sent to minister; the one bishop who, by his
researches and by his long and patient investiga-
tions, however much you may disapprove of them,
has left a permanent mark upon English theology-
yes, though you may ridicule, I say the one bishop
who, assaueu by scurrilous and unscrupulous invec-
tive unexampled in the controversy of this country,
and almost in the history, miserable as it is, of
religious controversy itself, continued his re-
searches in a manner in which he stood quite
alone, and never returned one word of harshness
to his accusers; the one nishop that was revered
by the natives, who asked him to intercede for
them wbh the Government, and that without
reference to any other bishop of South Africa: the
on- bishop to whom the natives came long dis-
tances to place themselves m.der his protection,
or even to have the pleasure to look upon his
countenance. {‘Order.’) You need not call
‘ Order!’ I will not be restrained by th;s mockery,
these jee s, this ridicule, these gibes! I say there
will be one bishop who, when his own interests
were on one side, and the interests of a poor savage
chief on the other, did not hesitate to sacrifice his
own, and, with a manly generosity for which this
society has not a w< rd of sympathy, did his best to
protect the supplicant; did not hesitate to come
oyer from Africa to England to plead the cause of
this poor unfriended savage, and when he had
secured the support of the Colonial Office—unlike
other colonial bishops—he immediately went back
to his diocese. For all these i hings the Society for
the Propagation of the Gospel app ars to have no
sympathy; but you may depend upon it that out-
side t'lese walls —in the world at large—whenever
Natal is mentioned, they will wi admiration; and
posterity will say that among the propagators of
the Gospel in the nineteenth century the Bishop of
Natal was not the least efficient.”

supply the places of the claw-hammer banger,
ffdovas, and eye-glass of the ball-room; instead of
the tedious leading of your partner up stairs and
back for refreshments, a bucket of “tanglefoot,”
with a pint pot attached, is placed in a conspicuous
corner of the casino, and the orchestra generally
seats himself in the fire-place. Even the freezing

WOMAN ITEMS.
At an orthodox Jewish wedding, recently
performed in London, the bride’s hair was cut
completely off immediately after the ceremony, in
accordance with the ancient custom, the idea
bei nff to render the lady as unattractive as possible,
so that there would be no inducement for her to
prove untrue, at least till her hair grew longer,
this was all very well during the Mosaic age, but
now-a-days the prudent bride simply saves the
pieces and has them worked into a gorgeous bang

The Prince of Wales’last new fancy is Miss
Chappell, niece of the well-known music publisher
of Bond-street, London, who is, indeed, a beautiful
1,.' ri « ue ’ * n these days, which are not the times
of the Merry Monarch, has rights which even
royalty is bound to respect; nevertheless, there is
an odium (to some extent the result of feminine
jealousy) which will linger when a woman is known
to have been admired by the Prince, and respect-
able girls, but particularly their parents, feel this
very keenly. A young Scotch girl recently went
to London on a visit to some relatives, and soon
after her arrival sho met the Prince of Wales at a
ball, where he paid her a great deal of attention, and
the next day sent her a magnificent bouquet, with
his compliments. Her relatives were so alarmed at
the affair that they sent the girl straight back by
the first train to Scotland out of harm’s way I
It is stage etiquette that an actor should
never kiss a lady on the lips, unless he has first
received consent, but must, while making an
apparent swoop for them, so as to deceive the
audience, really alight on her chin, or somewhere
in the vicinity. This crushes all the tenderness out
of a love-scene to the principal performers. No
matter how dimpled and smooth a woman’s chin
may be, there is an irresponsiveneas about it that
must strike a chill to the heart of the earnest
kisser. A cheek is a slight improvement on the
chin, because there is less bone about it; but be-
hind the ear is the most desolate wilderness of all.
The reason why the husband of a pretty actress
can look calmly on while the star osculates with
his wife is explained by the chin manoeuvre or ear
swindle. But notwithstanding that husbands in-
sist that the star shall just strike at that particular
uninteresting spot, and no other, accidents do oc-
casionally occur. When an actress Is really good-
looking, an involuntary movement of the laay, or
a pardonable nervous mistake on the part or the
gentleman, will prevent the most precise shooting
star in the universe from aiming straight; and
after all, the pouting lips do receive the errant
salute which etiquette — and husbands — insist
should fall only on the chin, or cheek, eye, hair, or
ear.
Here is a coincidence. A certain Sydney
magistrate said, In dismissing a case the other day,
I shall dismiss every case of women-insulting
where it can be shown that the. woman first flirted
with the accused.” And, twenty-three centuries
ago, Herodotus—of whom this worthy magistrate
had probably never heard —wrote after this
fashion“ The Persians appear to be of opinion
that they who offer violence to women must be
insensible to the impressions of humanity and
ustice, but that such provocations are as much
beneath revenge as the women themselves are un-
deserving of regard, it being obvious that all the
females thus circumstanced must have been more
or less accessory to the fact.” This is pretty rough
on lovely woman, but it shows that with all our
veneer of politeness we are not very far in ad-
vance of the primitive Persian. And, speaking of
Persia, reminds us of the fact that the Shah of
that giddy land is accused of having had the wife
of the Swedish captain of a Caspian coasting ship
abducted and earned to his harem in Teheran. He
has our sympathy—the Shah, we mean. The hus-
band probably went mad with joy when ho heard
the news. Persia is like many other places we
know, in one respect. It is much easier to get a
wife there than to get rid of one. (We can’t write
any more on this subject till she lets go our hair).
A brand new translation of Catullus’s
“ Ad Lesbiam ” (Carmen V.): —
Let us live and love, my Lesbia;
All the gossip of old people,
All the frowns of ugly fogies.
Let us rate at half-a-farthing:
Sunrise ever follows sunset:
But when once our brief lamp quenched is,
All is night—we sleep for ever.
Therefore, kiss me in this fashion—
First a thousand, then a million;
Second thousand, second million;
Then third thousand, and third million,
Kiss me till we’ve got to billions.
Then we’ll jumble all together,
Lest some evil-minded person
Should be jealous, when he finds out
What’s the total of our kissing.
We crib the foregoing airy trifle from “ Juvenal,
Persius, Martial, and Catullus—an Experiment in
Translation,” by W. J. Shaw, M.A., late Fellow of
Trinity Hall, Cambridge (a brother, we believe, of
Mr. John Shaw, of the Cumberland Mercury).
The intensity of the passage reminds us of some
lines we once read—in, we think, W. S. Mayo’s
“ Land at Last ”
“ And bury her beneath such heaps of roses,
That if she had ten thousand thousand noses
She’d cry, ‘ Enough, enough I take off your
posies,
My heart was icy, but it now unfroze is.’ ” ■

Mrs. Hampson, with a great gift of the gab
and the charms of a very nice figure, draw, nr
crowds in Melbourne, to the extreme Indignation
or parsondom, who consider that a woman has no
right to preach; which is a singular view for
jarsondom to entertain, seeing that it is muchly
inclined to regard being old womanlike as the
ne plus ultra of evangelical style.

Dr. G. Thou, of Rockhampton, contributes
to the current number of the Australasian
Medical Gazette a translated article, from which
we extract this:—“In a person taken out of the
water apparently dead, not only is the temperature
of the body lowered, but it continues to fall still
more, and death must be the natural result. It is
therefore plain enough that the first step towards
a rational treatment is the application of artificial
heat. Hot clothes, however, soon lose their heat,
hot bricks, etc., act only locally, but a hot bath of
122 deg. F. will often prove successful if used with
caution, and for no longer time than a few
minutes. If one so hot is not at hand, water of a
temperature from 97 to 100 deg. F. will be sufficient
to prevent the temperature to sink below the
normal, but it then becomes necessary to place the
patient before an open fire, guarding nose and
mouth against the direct heat of it. A temperature
of from 90 to 104 deg. can this way easily bo borne.
The thermometer, snowing the temperature of the
body, should now guide us in our further treat-
ment; it will decide when it is time to put the
patient to bed, how long we may leave him in it or
remove him again to the fire, and what distance
from or near it will be the most useful for him.”
Surely parsons must write the “ladies
letters” which abound in the dallies at this time!
Here, for instance, is some reverend person, pro-
bably a bishop, commending a “Dinner Year
Book ” sent her (the bishop) from New York. She
quotes thusly: “ Amongst other things the
authoress insists that a beefsteak cooked upon a
f ridiron, is quite a superior thing to one that is
ried, in which opinion I entirely agree.” What I
has it come to this? Is there any bushwhacker in
Australia who does not shove his steak—when he
has one—into the embers, and leave even a grid-
iron behind ? What, in the name of Beelzebub, do
bishops think Australians are made of ? Because
a man happens to visit Australia for a long term,
or, probably against his will, be bom there, has he
consequently forgotten, or never known the con-
nection between a beefsteak and a gridiron. This
comes of letting bishops write in the papers. “ A
beefsteak cooked upon a—” Bah I Enough. Let
bishops ponder on Tennyson’s “ Lines to a Steak,”
from the “Princess” :—
“ Fry me no more, the fire may draw the fat;
The meat make soup on ash and take the blood,
With fold to fold of coal or mallee-wood;
But O, too fond, why am I frizzled at?
Fry me no more.
Pry me no more: what frizzle should be mine ?
I love not hollow slab, or hard-burnt chunk:
Yet, O my friend, I will not have thee shrunk;
Fry me no more, lest I forget to dine;
Fry me no more.
Fry me no more; thy gravy’s almost run:
I strove against the fry pan all too late;
Let the great gridiron take me to the plate;
No more, dear love, for to a turn ’tls done;
Fry me no more.
THE BOTTLE OF GENEVA.
To Manly Sunday morning
We went in search of fun.
Ah! recollection dawning.
We’d been “ sitting in the sun.”
We’d fossicked round and round the tap,
No go! We but unearthed a “trap.”
We twigg’d him, with a look intent.
Clasp something in a bottle;
One furtive glance. Inverse it went,
“ Glug, glug,” adown his throttle.
We ran to ask how he had found it,
It looked like gin and luscious sounded.
To anxious queries re a Schnapps,
The myrmidon replied:
“ You’d better clear away, young chap,
No one’s allowed inside f
This boozing game is squashed, you see,
Since the ‘Teetotal Victory!’
“ I earn my drain, that you’ll agree;
The landlords here about.
When they gets cornered, sends for me
To chuck the loafers out.
I’m shepherding this pub., you see.
Through this ‘Teetotal Victory I’ ”
“ Well, tell us how it came to pass ?”
Entreatingly we said,
“ And how our legislators crass
Conceived this measure dread.
Expound to us this liquor law,
And what they parch our gullets for.”
“ The Bungs assisted,” “ Bobby ” said,
“ To turn Sir ’Enry out;
And now that Stuart’s got his * bed,’
They’re dazed, and can’t make out
How these, their friends, could party be
To this ‘ Teetotal Victory.’
“ A former boss of that hotel,
With borrowed coin did buy
The business: now it’s gone to—well.
He’s been compelled to fly;
So with a heavy heart he fled
To San Francisco, it is said.
“ It was a funny sight the day
The Act came into force,
For hundreds gazed in black dismay,
Then cussed in accents hoarse.
The thirsty sinners couldn’t see
The force of this ‘ Great Victory!’
“ Great praise from ‘Totes,’ Sir ’Enry got.
And Davies, C.M.G.”
“ Why, this is all the blankest rot,”
Quoth I, indignantly.
“ Nay, nay, dyspeptic one,” said he,
“ A great ‘ Teetotal Victory.’
“ And those who’ve cellars laud the votes
That this restriction passed—”
“ We’ll join a club, or all be Totes;
But tell us, will it last ?”
He said he couldn’t tell, and we
Drank ginger-beer despairingly.

IN view of the coming Wool Season, I beg leave
to offer my sincere thanks to my numerous
friends for their support and confidence hitherto,
and to assure them and all who may favour me
with their business, that I am now in a position to
do the fullest justice to their interests on the
LOWEST possible scale of CHARGES. My whole
time and experience may be relied upon, and with
my efficient staff of assistants and salesmen, my
constituents may still depend upon every possible
attention. _
My UNRIVALLED NEW STORES at Darling
Harbour, adjoining the Railway Terminus, will be
ready for the coming season, and will, with my
EXTENSIVE WAREHOUSES at Circular Quay,
enable me to receive and SHOW TO ADVANTAGE
ten thousand bales weekly, without any fear of the
disadvantages so often arising from want of
STORAGE ACCOMMODATION, now that our
railways bring wool to Sydney so quickly.
During the season two sales will be held weekly,
one for lots of four bales and under, the other for
larger parcels, so as to eusure every attention to
eacn lot, no matter how small; and every lot,
small or large, will be, as hitherto, carefully ex-
amined and VALUED BEFORE SALE, and, if
required, reports sent to owners, and in all cases
owners may depend that each lot will be protected
up to FULL MARKET VALUE.
I will continue to MAKE ADVANCES on goods
for sale, and to PAY OVER PROCEEDS of sales,
in all cases, within a week of each sale, or, when-
ever required, on DAY OF SALE. I can also offer
every advantage to such of my friends as may
wish to have their wools sold in London.
All our steam companies, or forwarding agents
at railway stations, will RECEIVE AND FOR-
WARD w-ools on my account, and pay carriage or
other expenses; and any BANK or firm HOLDING-
LIENS on wool will, if asked, ALLOW OWNERS
to SEND THEIR WOOLS TO ME for sale or ship-
ment.
At my second annual wool show in March last,
the following gentlemen, amongst others, SE-
CURED PRIZES, viz.:—Andrew Murray, Esq., of
Bannockburn, Inverell; W. Reardon, Esq., of The
Oaks, Gundagai; and John Hurley, Esq., of Kil-
laneah, Burrowa ; and as I purpose OFFERING
PRIZES each year still, I hope my friends will pay
attention to the quality and preparation of their
wools. Too much care now cannot be given, not
only to the quality of wool, but also to its prepa-
ration for market, and this advice applies equally
to the smallest, as well as the largest clips. All
who wish to make the most of their wool wi’l do
well to take care at shearing time, and keep sepa-
rate fine wool, coarse wool, ewe's wool, wether a
wool, black wool, wool of long staple from wool of
slmrt staple, and, as far as possible, burry wools
should be kept by themselves, and all bellv wools,
locks, pieces, &c., should be carefully taken off
each fleece, and baled or bagged separately. A
great deal could be said on this subject, and I shall
be glad to communicate with any person desiring
further information.
For the last two or three seasons, prices in Sydney
have been at least equal to Loudon prices, and
with the regular attendance of so many buyers for
American and Continental account, as well as lor
our English manufacturers, this market may now
be relied upon with every confidence; and from
the increasing quanties now sold in Sydney eacn
year, it is plain that our growers are fast losing
faith in the London market.
To such of my friends as may send sheepskins,
tallow, hides, hair, horns, bones, leather, &c., to
this market, I wish to mention that my stores at
Circular Quay are specially adapted for these lines,
and that no trouble shall be spared to deserve the
very liberal support I have hitherto received.

increased likewise; and the honest-
hearted, horny-handed sons of toil—the

also the clever and skilful mechanic, the
ever-toiling shopman and hard-working
clerk, the studious r nd thoughtful men
of letters, of law, of physics, of jour-

The following letter was received by Mr.
ArTnlebv. while he stage-managed a certain Aus-
S n theatre, and was lent by him to somebody
and copied it for the benefit of
run LETIN readers:—Adelaide, March 1st, 1883. Mr.

ing and Tailoring but it is of no use I cannot study
nothing but Piacces for the stage I have com-
nossed and worite to Plays named the Gipsys
ffu and Lady Mauds Secrets. My dear Sir do
not thtuk me forward in Writing to you For
a (.tresses should not be shy Do not say I am to
young tobe one For 1 will be 16, on the 34 th of this
Anril I will not earn my liveing has anything else
hut an Actress If I can help it, My dear bir I would
lik to bind myself for Four or, five years to you or
some of the Compy Do not be to Proud or to
offended at me has not to Answer my letter and
let me know at once this is a peeace of my own
composing—
the rose bud and the rose.
The rosebud that blooms to-day If Plucked will
Droop to morrow, Then leaf by leaf will soon-
Decav And leave its rose to sorrow, so lik that
Little bud there bloomed A babe so pure devine
The Mother lik the rose was doomed to see her
sweet bud pine

There is nothing new under the sun—or,
perhaps we should say, under the moon. “Jo” at
the Royal, still. And “ Jo” with a Guppy that is a
crusher. Now Mr. Warner, who is an intelligent
young gentleman whom we have heard singing
doleful comic songs with much dan, should know
—or be taught to know—that Guppy is not a cha-
racter of the music-hall type; that in the book he
never dressed in a white flannel jacket or chess-
board pants: and that vulgar as he was, he was
never a swell of the “ Champagne Charley” order,
and though often obtrusive, never demonstratively
farcical. Guppy was a cad, but he didn’t know it.
Mr. Warner represents him ns a mad cad who tries
to be madder than he really is. This is not art.
We don’t know what it is; but it is not art. And
if we have a predilection for anything, it is to see
an artistic performance. We would freeze all
night on a doorstep to sec a clever conception.
And we have often, be it said, sat on a doorstep
all night, knawing a bone; but we have hardly
ever seen an artistic performance. We have Mr.
Warner’s welfare at heart. He is young, and, we
daresay, virtuous. That’s why wo want him to
improve. And he can only improve by studying
his author. We don’t mean Mr. Burnett. A man
of less decided talents. You know who it is.
Don’t let a pin drop while you read this.
The Gaiety Theatre lease was sold for £300, and
John Bennett bought it. John, by the way, 1s
always buying things. We were up at Parramatta
one day, when we saw him purchase about twenty
miles of country- We wont up ourselves to buy
the same block, but, as we could only show one-
and-ninepence, they wouldn't take Our bid. Well,
Verdi, it seems, has taken a sub-lease from Ben-
nett; and is to open in English opera. The prima
donna—and this is an affecting thing—is Miss Alice
Rees. They are to produce “ Carmen.” Verdi, we
may mention, is looking quite more splendid than
ever. He seems rosier, and is certainly fatter.
He only arrived yesterday, and yet his mail was
twenty letters and packets. Twenty! And they
contained everything from diamonds to coke-
dust. We know there was coke-dust in one of
them, because we sent it ourselves. We wish Mr.
Verdi a prosperous season. We consider that the
stylo or entertainment Mr.—hold on, Signor—
Verdi intends to introduce is about “Carmen” in
at the right time.

The opera of our old friend, Crook, is
running along a good deal better than we thought
it would. It is not its intrinsic merit, but the
merit of the performers that pulls it through. The
dear Ivanova is in her own pretty person a suffi-
cient compensation for any amount of tinsel in the
Siece, not to speak of that other lovely loadstone,
iiss Kate Chard. Anyhow, the “ King’s Dragoons”
is a draw, and when Mr. Dunning puts on that
sparkling opera, “The Mounted Police,”—as the
Rum calls it—we shall all be happy.
FACT AND FANCY FOCUSED.
Power, the bushranger, has been informed
by the Victorian penal authorities that he must
serve his full sentence....“The Indian Corn Doc-
tor,” arrested at Brisbane on Wednesday, wanted
in Melbourne. Charge, fraudulent insolvency....
Queensland sheep numbered at millions—A
prisoner named Jackson escaped from Orange
Gaol on Tuesday. Comptroller Maclean’s up-coun-
try jugs are precious leaky —When it was cabled
that the natives of Borneo had massacred the
entire staff of the North Borneo Co. at Aumour,
the Herald simply called this “ unpleasant news.”
Of course, quite‘‘unbecoming.” Bishop Selwyn
says the Florida islanders now honoured and re-
spected men-of-war. Wouldn’t hated and dreaded
be more accurate? The Manning River Times
man has been writing a defence of euphemistic
phraseology. Evidently he wants somebody to
call him an editor A question which arose at
Townsville assizes with reference to the age of an
aboriginal girl, who had been assaulted by a white
man, was decided by a medical opinion based on an
examination of her teeth The Kea is a New
Zealand bird which settles on the back of sheep,
and pecking through their skin causes their death.

see Mary Ann James homo from Wesleyan Church
(she lived at Ross’s Creek, near Ballarat), and now
David James wants £500 damages from Tom on ac-
count of his impassioned attentions to Mary Ann.
Infallible statistics make it abundantly clear that
seeing girls home from Church is an expensive
amusement all round... .Alf. heads a par. about
Devoy of the Nation having been sent up for (50
days for slander “ Conviction of an Editor ” (in big
type) as though ho (Alf.) were staggered at the
idea of an editor having convictions—Brisbane

late Deputy Registrar, succeeds him — Mark this
ad. from a Melbourne paper: “Wanted im-
mediately, an idle, drunken bookkeeper. The
advertiser has had so many steady clerks whose
‘ character for sobriety and honesty ’ has always
been undoubted (according to testimonials), that
he would like to try one who owns up to drunken-
ness just by way or a change. Apply, &c.”. ..Near
Normanton (Q.), Mr. Fred. Fogarty’s horse, a very
young one, fell and rolled on its rider, crushing his
life out. Mr. Fogarty was but 33, and a native of
Maitland, N.S.W “Garranny” was out of it
when she talked the other day of the Austrian
provinces of Riesen and Gebirge, in happy forget-
fulness or ignorance of the fact that the Reisen-
gebirge is a range of Bohemian mountains... The
Pitt-street (Sydney) Congregational Literary Asso-
ciation have decided that Shakespeare was not
the author of the plays usually assigned to him.
The immortal William may now git I His hash (not

dynamite cap with a pin. One of his hands now

Out of the fire into the frying-pan.... Yass Quar-
ter Sessions (before the Macfarlaud): James Boon
pleaded guilty to forging a cheque, and his Honor
having (according to the Courier) pointed out to
prisoner the enormity of his crime, sentenced him
to two years in Darlinghurst: and if, at the end of
twelve months, prisoner sent in a petition for a
remission of sentence, he would recommend his
discharge. Where does the enormity come in ?
It’s this sort of judicial tomfoolery that makes the
rogue laugh in his sleeve, and the common sensical
citizen to blaspheme—Soldiers and sailors in
uniform mustn’t wear the temperance blue
ribbon A much needed measure is a Cata-
I niter Nuisance Prevention Act. Since to
work such a statute would require an army of
inspectors, there’s some chance of it being passed.
Bills that savour of patronage and billets usually
meet with support on both sides of the House—
Alex. Richardson, ox-Mayor of Armidale, told
District Surveyor Chard that he (Chard) was study-
ing his own convenience without caring for that
of the public in reference to the site of the
Armidale Lands and Survey Office. Next day
Chard asked Richardson to withdraw the expres-
sion. The latter declined, whereupon the surveyor
“ let the ex-Mayor have it," for the which assault
the local bench fined him £3.... Astronomer Russell
has been devoting attention to t he star of Bethle-
hem question, and can’t see anything in it... .Body

blew his brains out on Thursday last. He was to

letter was read from the member for the district,

Two boys were sleeping together; one was
Catholic, the other Protestant. When they woke
in the morning, the latter thought to get a rise of
the former. “Oh!" said the one. “I had a horrid
drame last night.” “ Well, tell it to us,” said the
other. ‘‘Well, I will.” said the Protestant boy;
“ ye see, I drained that I saw Purgathory opened
and all the Papists fall down into Hell.’ " Och,
murder!” exclaimed the Catholic boy; “the poor
Protestants—won’t they be crushed!”
In Winward Reade’s book, the “Martyr-

the progress of sanitary science, man will invent
immortality. Now comes the great statist, Mr.

Spectator, and proves that, during the past thirty
years, the longevity of the British public has in-
creased two years for men; and, for women, three

The French lost no men in their bombard-
ment and seizure of Tamatave, the principal sea-
port of Madagascar. This is only two men less than
the British lost in the affair at Alexandria; so that
the capture of Tamatave seems to have been almost
as glorious a victory. It now only remains for the
Chamber of Deputies to vote Admiral Pierre £20,000
and an annuity for two lives, to put the two events
on an equal footing.

The fencing of the Wilcannia cemetery is
broken down in many places; hence horses, cattle,
pigs, and goats walk around as they see fit; and,
what is worst of all, no effort is made to keen the
Protestant stock distinct from the Roman ditto.
To see a Wesleyan pig rooting near a Hebrew’s
grave, or a Papist’s cow chewing the cud alongside
an Orangeman’s sepulchre, these are the heart-

At Mondrook, N.S.W., on a recent Satur-
day night, a small farmer bought a pair of super-
fine elastic-side boots. He required them for Sun-
day, and to stretch them filled them with com and

his horror, he found two of his young pigs inside-

The Herald’s oalegrams are of such an
extraordinary character at present that we must
shortly expect something like this:—“ (Prom our
own correspondent.) London, June 26th. It is re-
ported from Ireland that the world has come to an
end.” Next day it will be:—“London. June27th.
The report (from Ireland) that the world has come

For “tone,” Queensland is pre-eminent.
Not so very long ago, a shingle used to be hoisted
in the Brisbane Botanic Gardens, and on it was
inscribed the following legend :—“No dogs or
soldiers admitted.” And to-day the tariff-notice

door made wider with a view to bringing his feet-

This is the latest from Bungeroo. The
blacks there got so drunk that they couldn’t hold
their corroboree. The editor of the local rag was
very severe on this; but he forgot to point a moral
when the member, the Mayor, the blacksmith, and
the sexton were all too dyspeptic to attend a ban-
quet given in honour of the 75th anniversary of
the trooper’s aunt. But, then, you can’t always say
what you like in this country. That’s why we ad-
vocated an increase in the salary of the judges.

An ingenious Brisbane man invented a
new temperance drink, the other day, and supplied
all the bars—sale or return. The profits being
large, the publicans rather pushed the stuff. But
the sale has fallen off. The liquor didn’t receive
unqualified approval. One evening a bushman
had it shoved on to him, and took it down. Then
he seemed to meditate. “What’s the price?” he
asked at last. “ Sixpence,” replied the lovely bar-
maid. clanking her diamond earrings. “There’s
yer sixpence, he said: and then producing a shil-
ling—“ and here’s a bob extry it you’ll pump the
blank stuff out of me again.”
Mr. Blank is secretary for a benevolent
association in a Southern city, and the owner of a
cottage and section which he sometimes rents to
poor people receiving outdoor relief from the
funds of the institution. The relief in question
consequently frequently consists of payments to
himself of the sums due by the poor persons to
whom he rents the premises. But he had, besides,
another claim on their affections. In spring or
early summer he prefers to have for tenant some
broken-down person who is just able to plant the
section with a good crop of potatoes, and who
fondly hopes to eat the fruit of his labour in the
autumn and winter seasons of the year. But the
secretary decides otherwise. Before the crop is
ready for lifting he finds that this particular cot-
tage is urgently required for some more pressing
case of destitution. The potato-planter is com-
pelled to flit, and some poor widow and her hap-
less progeny take his place. Then, indeed, the
shining perfections of this benevolent secretary
reveal themselves in all their pristine beauty, as at
early morn and at dewy eve he and his son,
and a four-pronged fork, may be seen toiling
away digging up these potatoes, carefully hoarding
them in sacks, and afterwards conveying them to
his own home, where true charity with mm always
begins, and, for the matter of that, always ends as
well. If the poor cripple who planted these pota-
toes, or the poorer widow who has succeeded him
in the tenancy, were allowed to gather and eat
them, what a terrible encroachment on the rights
of “jproppity,” what a blot on the civilisation of
the 19th century, such a transaction would be!
But, no I Thanks to the devil, it has not come to
that.
Let law, religion, arts, and commerce die,
But spare us still the rights of property.
A LAY SERMON.


The teacher of a State school at Gordon
/V'ic) found that no child in his fourth class had
heard of those two important pimples, Mounts
Rinal and Ararat, and that only three had heard of
Noah The latter were all Roman Catholics, and
It was not quite certain that the Noah they had
heard about was the genuine one after all, as the
“own-up sister of one of them had run away with
a man named Noah Muggins some time before.
This is getting serious. Mature people, as a rule,
know a good deal too much of Noah and his mob.
The original person of that name, it will be re-
membered, was the gifted Imbecile who put no
gangway to the ark, and having crept into his tub,
was mean enough to nail up the one window, and
pull down the blind. He it was who, if report
speak truly, seeing the enemy of mankind floating
by on a orate, mocked him with unmerited vin-
dictiveness. But he mistook his mark. Is it not
recorded that, being insultingly refused admission,
the devil, smarting under the boss mariner’s inhu-
manity and badinage, threw back the insults with
many personal allusions to the patriarch’s eyes,
adding, with not undeserved bitterness, “To Hades
with your old hulk!—it’s only a shower, after all.”
Mr. Britten, a struggling Bega selector,
has, according to the Cooma paper, been around
the neighbourhood buying turkeys, and paying
from 7s. to 8s. per pair for them to sell in the
Sydney market. Mr. Britten camped at Berridale
one night. He travels on foot with the birds, and
he can walk 17 miles per day. Monaro turkeys are
not bad walkers. The excessively muscular con-
dition (out of deference to our landlady, we don’t
say toughness) of the turkeys at our boarding-
house has filled us—well, not perhaps with admira-
tion, but certainly with wonder, for some time
past. “Too muchee walk about,” as the North
Queensland blackfellows say when they get hold
of a working bullock. Now that O’Leary has
been twice beaten by Edwards, we moan to try to
f et up a match between the Yankee und a Monaro
urkey,
“ Breed ? Ah, my dear sir,” said the bank
manager, “your notions are exceedingly unbusi-
nesslike.” The boss of the usury shop was quite
right. His notions regarding breed were indeed
strange, for he held that breed has as much effect
on men and women as on horses; and having,
beside, a largo credit balance to his name, did not
care a solitary water-conservator how the manager
might receive his ideas. Continued that (as usual)
highly vulgar-looking and thoroughly underbred
functionary: “Yes, my dear sir, one would think
to hear you that without blue blood a man were
not fit to enter society or occupy any responsible
position. Utter nonsense, I assure you. Breed?
A b-reed—a ‘broken-reed’—see a joke? Ha! ha!
What could breed have done for me ?” Then the
other responded very slowly and distinctly: “ Well,

During the great floods at Baiclutha (N.Z.),
a few years ago, the “ Doctor,” locally and affec-
tionately known as the “ Dock," heard fearful cries
as of someone drowning in front of his house,
which was surrounded with water. Hastily throw-
ing down the ace of spades and seizing the trick,
the “ Dock ” sprang to his feet and rushed out on
the verandah. It was getting dark at the time,
and he could just discern a white object, which
gave vent to the most heart-rending cries of dls-
tress, being carried down by the current near his
house. Without a moment’s delay he plunged
into the boiling abyss of flood-water, fully sixteen
fathoms deep (or less), and emerged in a few
minutes dripping from head to foot, with his own
pig fondly clasped and grunting in his arms.
“Hoor-ah! hoorah!” shouted the gathering citizens
with one voice; “the old ‘Dock’ has saved his
bacon after all.” And he did. That pig is still
shown to visitors at Baiclutha as a porker plucked
from a watery grave.

In 1882 the total number of letters posted
in N.S.W. was 37,438,300. Of these about 35,000,000
were headed “ To acc/ rendered.”
The Bishop of Melanesia, when exhausted

The text of “Edinburgh’s” paper, which

The Argus and Age have both sent ex-
plorers to New Guinea. The natives are quite
Indifferent what papers they represent, provided

There have been wonderfully high tides in
Port Adelaide. It is imported that the editor of
Punch, who is on a visit to Melbourne, had dipped
bis feet into Hobson’s Bay.
The old story: Dick Loob, station hand,
earns money like a horse on Goodabendgal run,
spends it like an ass at Temora pubs. The spree”
over, D.T. supervenes on the lambed-down Loob —
in which state he severs his jugular. No cards.
Combo, a darkle, is under arrest on a
charge of murdering a half-caste boy, the son of
his gin. Ho held the child under water until it
was drowned. Ho should have done that to his
gin when the child was born. There is no law to
prevent a man watering his gin.
The Mayor has determined not to award
any more prizes for first water played by fire
brigades on occasion of alarm of fire. The ’arries
of the volunteer organisations, who are naturally
much harrassed in mind by this action of Harris’s,
say ho is not by any means a gem of the first
water.
The new offices of the Mining Department
are Lincoln’s Inn Chambers, rental £3000 a year, j
payable to the erectors of the said Chambers, the |
Financial Building Society. There’s an aroma of
tiddliwinking about the arrangement which we
would like to see analysed, just to see Watts in it,

Washington Soul announces a powder
wherewith to make light bread. Ho should
“stash” that announcement, and seek to deserve
eternal credit by putting on the market a powder
wherewith to secure full-weight loaves. That’s
what’s wanted. Any ordinary baker is equal to the
light bread manoeuvre with or without powder or
soul.
P.L.M., in the continuation of his history
of Artillery in the H erald, oughtn’t to omit refer-
ence to the brilliant attack made by Mr. William
Hunter in June, ’83, on the guard-room of the
Paddington Barracks, in which affair a detachment
of gunners were circumvented, and a sentry
placed hors lie combat by an insignificant-looking
fellow with a revolver. P.L.M. might also suggest
the advantage of detailing bobbies to serve along
with bombardiers, in order to arrest attacking
parties, and otherwise afford protection to the
“ ubiques.”
Somewhat acidly yet with much truth the
Yass Courier says:—“The records of the Insol-
vency Court of New South Wales, so far as they
are known to the public, reveal this much, at all
events, that Official Assigneeism has been tried,
and found wanting; that honest debtors have been
plunged deeper into the mire; that creditors’ assets
have been wasted or peculated by thousands upon
thousands of pounds sterling; that scoundreldom
(whether that of the fradulent insolvent or of the
roguish assignee) has alone benetltted; that, in a
word, what should be a temple of commercial
justice, is a den in which it is difficult to tell
whether Fraud, Corruption, or Incapacity works
the most Iniquity!”
Tom Walker, the Freethinker, has been
prominent lately in Melbourne. He summoned a
grocer for pushing him off a platform which he
was mounting to speak at a meeting on the Sun-
day Observance question. Tom contended it was
a “public” meeting, and, therefore, claimed a
right to speak. The defendant pleaded the meeting
was only for those who desired to protest against
Sabbath desecration, and, therefore, Tom wasn’t
“in it.” The magistrates debated 45 minutes, and
then dismissed the complaint. Tom Walker, who
conducted his own case without a lawyer, imme-
diately said he would carry the case before the
Supremo Court, at which the court applauded.
He was a native of an island in the Atlantic
Ocean, and was elected on a school committee in
Otago. A hot discussion took place over scholastic
affairs, in which frequent reference was made to
the school as the “ main school ” of the district.
“ Shnre, now,” urged the new committeeman, per-
suasively, “it’s meself that can’t see any raison
for calling this school a ‘mane school. I see
nothing mane in it, although we don’t pay any
school fees. Shure, if we don’t pay the fees aren’t
we’s all taxed to kape it up by the Government ?”
Loud applause and laughter followed this brilliant
protest, and good humour once more presided at
the meeting.
He was a new-chum Presbyterian divine
labouring in New Zealand, and was for the first
time in his life the proud possessor of a horse—the
gift of his admiring congregation. His figure
astride the astonished quadruped was not all his
admirers fancied, nor was it all his fancy had
painted the position for himself, but he stuck to
the seat, nevertheless, through thick and thin.
Having the horse fairly broken into his ways, as he
imagined, he one morning rode him to the banks
of the Clutha, in front of the Court-house, where a
crowd of people had gathered for an election. For
half an hour or more he wrestled with the animal
trying to get him down to the river side, and the
crowd wondered greatly why he wanted to swim
the river when a good bridge was close at hand.
At last one of them guessed how matters stood,
and cried out; “Oh, no don’t want a drink yet,
master; he ain’t thirsty, he ain’t.” “Ah,” replied
the minister, “ that may be, my friend, that may
be; but I want him to have a drink.” “Well,
parson,” said the other, quoting proverb: “One
man may take a horse to the water, but it’ll take a
good many on us to make him drink if he don’t
want to.” The crowd guffawed, the divine wheeled
about and rode through Balclutha so fast that the
ladies of the borough, seeing him pass in such
hot haste, thought surely the minister was off for
the doctor.
In the early days of a certain Northern
town, two constables who were in charge of that
station used to dispense among the Chinese who
comprised the bulk of the population a rude and
profitable kind of justice which “took well and
gave pleasure to all,”—at least it gave pleasure to
the constables. They used to levy a tax of £3 per
week on every Chinaman who ran a fan-tan shop,
and ten bob a head on every one who kept a—par-
lour maid. If any Chinaman failed to “dub up”
on Saturday nights, they either seized the fan-tan
implements or himself. When they seized the fan-
tan tools they kept them till the Chinaman released
them, in the meantime taking good care that he
did not get a new turn-out and start a fresh
shop. But when they seized himself (which
was always the quickest way of making him
“dub up*’) they at once proceeded with much
solemnity to try him for “gambling without a
license.” One mounted a chair, with a bible in one
hand and a drawn sword in the other; the other
brought up the Chinaman before him in handcuffs
and leg-irons ; all the revolvers and rifles in the
barracks were slapped down oh the table with an
emphasis that used to make the “ prisoner ” bound
up in the air like an old kangaroo; and, amid the
rattle of chains and the clash of swords, he would
be fined £5, or three months in gaol. His country-
men would then make a collection for him, and pay
the lino. In a short time after the Chinamen would
bo lotting off crackers in honour of their country-
man’s safe return, and the constables would be
nudging each other in the ribs and dividing the
“ fine” over a bottle of brandy in the leading hotel.
After the pair wore shifted to remote districts, two
other officers took their places, and they could not
understand what the Chinamen meant by coming
to them for “gambling licenses ” and—well, other
licenses ; and it was fully twelve months before
the Sub-inspector saw the joke, and began to
smell a rat.
An Answer to a Correspondent
Pinchgut Gully, writes as follows:—
“ My lot has been a poor one, and my way
Has lain in Poverty's deep darks and hollo ws,
Obscure f rom Fortune's glad delighting ray.
The chink of coin—sound sweeter than
Apollo's
Charmed lyre—has seldom with its music
gay
Made my heart joyous, and a life of sordid
Base want my every effort has rewarded.
For years Fvc struggled honestly and vainly
To win a fairer portion, but, alas!
Adversity still shows her front ungainly,
And all my palaces of rainbow glass
Are shattered; so I write'to tell you plainly
I’m tired of being honest, so —I pass.
Can you oblige me, through this column,
sonny,
With some straight tip of getting hold of
money f" —
“We can—get half a stick of Stockholm tar in
A jar, and give the filly croton oil;
This shows at once how many yards there arc
in
The tank you mention, let it slowly boil;
The theatre was hired for both to spar in,
Not as you hint; see article on ‘ Soil
A private usually salutes his Colonel.”
(See recent number Down and Gumtree
Journal).
Poor P.J.B. ! Thou, too, in quest of riches
Wouldst wander from the straight and
narrow track;
Wouldst climb the height, untrammelled by
the hitches
Of Conscience, which keeps ever looking
back ?
Come — we will tell thee a|new method, which,
is
Undoubtedly the best card in the pack :
A stunning notion which, succeeding greatly,
Is quite a fashionable fangle lately.
Quit manual toil—this climate’s much too
tropic.
And fencing is a line that early cloys,
And grubbing yields a wage too microscopic;
Let up on these, and, with a wiser choice,
Change the bucolic for the philanthropic,
And round up half-a-dozen pallid boys;
Then get some rich old mopokes to acknow-
ledge
An interest in your budding Orphans’ Col-
lege.
’Tis easily managed; send your wife about on
The mission—as a glove ’twill suit her band;
’Tis always well to send a female scout on
Such raids as this, for ladies can command
Such looks as serve for hooks to tlx a
Trouton;
Such sighs as bring a Windeyer to laud;
Such modest mien and matron grace as even
May quite win over a Sir Alfred Stephen.
Of course, such names would give your in-
stitution
A healthy shove, and all the world would
think
Your wife a woman of high resolution
To undertake her heavy cross, nor shrink
From lending energy and elocution
To mercy’s cause, and you could safely
wink
To her at eventide, o’er foaming Bass’s,
And say, with Carlyle, that most men were
asses.
As for the College—well, let’s see. You’d need
to
Have something with a roof on for a start;
Mere luxuries you wouldn’t give much heed
to
(You say that making money is your dart).
Most schools are much too elegant, indeed, to
Give strong direction to the youthful
heart.
Rig up a workshop—(let your names be
tallish),
Where homeless lads may learn to wash and
polish.
Be very careful, when you fill indentures,
To name no trade therein, as all such things
Prove rather hazardous to rising ventures,
And make them hop along with curtailed
wings.
Be studious that the boys ply easy trenchers,
And take no notice of mere bites or stings:
When one is bent upon amassing riches,
What matter about sandfly-bites or itches ?
Then, with the workshop in its pomp dis-
arming
All outside question, boldly take your
stand;
Go for cheap labourers and orphan-farming,
Teach infant prodigies to grub your land;
And get your missus, who (abroad) is charm-
ing,
To stump the colony with horse-leech
hand,
And scoop the rhino, which you can invest in
Philanthropy, or anything you think it’s
best in.
As time goes on, you’ll certainly be able
To sport more horses, and you’ll find a way
To save the cost attendant on a stable,
Of all that it requires, save corn and hay;
In this alone the orphan will be payable,
And grooming horses will be simply play
To ardept youth, who fancy it a slow thing
To make their beds and wash their under-
clothing.
You won’t be troubled much by your “ Com-
mittee”—
Such cheerful buffers have no time to spare.
(You mustn’t have your College near the
City),
They’ll take your word that everything is
fair;
You must, of course, invite the Press ban-
ditti,
And have a luncheon and a drop of
“square;”
There’s nothing so disarms a writer's trun-
cheon
As skilful blarney, “sawder,” or a luncheon.
Now, lean your ear down, P.J.B., and
hearken,
This is the straightest tip of all the lot:
Get some reporter—pick a real good mark on,
Who will not stop to “liquor’’from your
pot—
And all things looking just as they should
not;
— — — what’s truer than the Bible,
Go in for heavy damages for libel.

I was leaving the office of Public Shirks,
worn out with the daily toil which withers
us civil servants in early bloom, when I
caught sight of Deboots, an old school-
fellow, whom I had long lost sight of.
He linked his arm in mine, and talked about
old times. To hear him, you would have
thought we used to be bosom friends. In
fact, I found him much altered, and all for
the better.
I always hated the sight of Deboots, who
used to bully me frightfully at school; so
1 hid ray face in my paper.
He told me of the splendid society he mixed
in; related his successes on the turf, and
offered to put me on to a good thing—a
dead certainty at 15 to 1. Not caring to be
drawn in to anything risky, I explained
that all the money I had, 1 was saving up
to buy an allotment of land, and that I
didn’t wish to waste a single shilling.
It was no go. He saw me, and hailed me
with effusion. What was I doing with
myself? A civil servant. As for him—
living on his means; some lucky specs,
and so forth. But where could we go and
have a chat ?
Won by his frank cordiality, I opened my
heart, and confided to him a few matte rs
about the office, and about the Heads of
the Department who have always had a
down on me and have kept back my pro-
motion.
We plunged afresh into old times, and when he learned the names of
my chiefs, it came out that, by the most wonderful luck, he was
acquainted with nearly all of them—had met them at Government
House—and a word from him would make promotion a certainty.
From this moment all my prejudices melted away. I asked him to
“have something,” and he accepted on condition that I would lunch
somewhere with him.
Just then we met a young lady of his acquaintance, and to my great
delight he prevailed on ner to lunch with us.
Such a spread! The wine imparted extraordinary vivacity
to ray spirits. The young lady gave proofs of a rare dis-
crimination.
Unluckily, when the waiter brought the bill, Deboots dis-
covered that he had forgotten his purse, and I could do no
less than offer to lend him the money.
And here’s a week gone, and no
word of repayment; and the
Under-Secretary has just sent
for me to let me know that my
associations with bad characters
have been brought to his notice,
and that he has felt it his duty
to knock off the estimates sub-
mitted to the minister a £50
increase he had recommended
for me.

Hereford’s Acid Phosphate has become a favour-

out by prolonged wakefulness and overwork, it Is
of the greatest value to me. I have given it in
certain forms of dyspepsia, in all cases of nervous
exhaustion from overwork, in certain affections of

At the Melbourne City Council, Councillor
Wilks moved that “ it is not judlcl us to re ove
the Yarra Falls.” We have been m Melbourne,
and seen the Falls. They are near Blizabo h-street,
and are more than eighteen inches high. It is
always a ticklish thing to remove a fall—especially
when there is a nice face behind it. It is not every-
one who can bo trusted to shift a cataract. It will
be remembered that some spiteful persons tried
more than once to shunt Niagara on to the British
Government, but the B.O. had too much business
in hands at the time—John Brown was alive then—
and so, naturally enough, took a firm stand against
any more falls. And this beings us to Melbourne
and the Yarra. Of course, Sydneyites can afford
to be proud, and a bit offish and contemptuous
like. Wo have our Harbour and the Zigzag, Dar-
linghurst Gaol, Dan , Sir , and Larry Foley,
so that we are not a “ circumstance.” Still, a
man’s a man if he were In a bottle; and Wilks
(hurrah for Wilks I) thinks that obstruction, even
in a river, may be of service. But these Wilkses
were always an odd lot. Wasn’t there a splay-
footed, knock-kneed, pockmarked, swivel-eyed
chap of that name, who boasted that if he got a
ten-minutes’ start with the prettiest girl in Eng-
land, the greatest dandy within the four seas could
not cut him out? Of course there was; and he
afterwards gave a deal of trouble to the Lord’s
anointed (Farmer George—God bless him!) and
but enough of these historical recollections. He
had a fall, too. like his Melbourne namesake, and
we only hope he enjoyed it half as much.
It bus been suggested that, as Conserva-
tives wear primroses in their button-holes in
honour of the memory of Lord Beaconsfield,
Liberals should sport either “Sweet William” or
“ Collar-flowers ” in honour of the grand old man.
In a similar strain, we would suggest that N.S. W,
Parkesians should deck themselves with Glad-
I-O-U-las in honour of the member for Whereat.

The “Chloe” imbroglio is only beginning.
The picture- a nude girl—was lent by Dr. Fitz-
gerald to the trustees of the Melbourne Art
Gallery for exhibition. Numberless comments—
from the rhapsodies of icsthetic students to the
prim slip-slop of outraged old maidenhood—were
made upon it. Many of them found their way
into print in the columns of the Argus and other
journals. Then the doctor walked off with his
beautiful painting—but not before photographs
were taken. These were issued as a “supple-
ment” the Melbourne Bulletin. A Kyneton
tobacconist exhibited one in his shop window,
thinking, ..probably, that if the original were
innocuous the diminutive copies would be equally
so. Foolish man I Joe Brady and his “ Invinci-
bles” hacked a couple of innoffensive men to
death, and were hanged. Frederick and Napoleon
butchered millions, and were universally respected.
A Kyneton “ bobby,” Sergeant Manson, less of a
idealist than the tobacconist, ordered the imme-
diate removal of poor “ Chloe.” There is a screw
loose somewhere. The question of propriety is at
last adjudicated on by a rural policeman! We
would like to know more of Manson—we know
enough and to spare of “ Chloe.” Infelix “ Chloe 1”

Two circumstances we learn with almost
equal pleasure. The forthcoming release of Mr.
Barker, of Adelaide ; and the conviction and sen-
tence (six years penal servitude) of Louise Michel,
of Paris (France). It will be generally felt that :n
the incarceration of Mr. Barker, society has lost
an ornament. He was a man of genial tempera-
ment and lavish hospitality. There was nothing
about him that was moan, or degraded, or paltry.
He conducted his business on an extensive scale ;
and succeeded for a very long time. And it is
(should anything in the world be considered so)
worthy of remark that all the time ho succeeded
he was “ universally respected.” We know this,
(i'alleurs, of our own knowledge. Well, they have
remitted half Mr. Barker’s sentence ; and if they
do a few more things like this in the world, we
shall begin to respect it. Mr. Barker was convicted
of conspiring to cheat, and what some ungenerous
people would be disposed to call conspiring to
murder. But we are not ungenerous, so we don’t
call it that. And the reason that we are not un-
generous is because we are so poor. There is a
short story written, in two parts, by the late Mr.
Charles Dickens, who, we may as well inform our
readers, is the author of “ The Pickwick Papers,”
and other tracts. In this story (which is intensely
dramatic) one man insures another man’s life, and
then tries, by feeding him on salt provisions, and
dosing him with alcohol, to kill him. But all the
time the Intended victim only pretends to take the
food and liquors ; and in the result the would-be
murderer comes to a bad end. This causes us to
rather lose our opinion of Dickens as a student of
human nature. When he held the mirror up for
the reflections in that story, there must have been
a Jew picture-hawker present who was smoking a
bad cigar. In four months Mr. Barker will be
again a member—wo had almost said an estimable
member—of society; while the man with the im-
maculate parting, who tried to poison the hero of
the story, is dead. We don’t know what Barker
will do when he comes out; but it is expected he
will either take to the pulpit or the stage. What-
ever he does, we are sure he will prosper. Espe-
cially if he take to the pulpit. Ana this brings us
to our subject. They manage these things worse
in France. Or better. You can choose. Louise
Michel has just got six years for having the
courage of her opinions. Serve her right! We
had the courage of our opinions once, and we had
to pay £4000 or more for it. The moral here is ob-
vious. Don’t have the courage of your opinions ;
but conspire to well, to do several things.
And be happy.
Someone died lately, and ever since he died
he has been wrestling with his tombstone. He was
demurely lowered down, but they wonldn’t let him
rest. Hardly had he got on speaking terms with
the other corpses, than someone wrote this about
him in the 8.M. Herald death column:—
“A loving husband, true and kind,
He proved to be in heart and mind;
A tender parent, too, as well,
When he on earth with us did dwell.
But now his spirit it is fled.
And he is numbered with the dead:
He in the silent grave does sleep,
And wo his loss do mourn and weep.”
We live near the Necropolis, and are on terms of
respectful intimacy with several corpses. We don’t
mind saying that we have been mean enough to be
friendly with skeletons merely to avoid paying
threepence for the Tribune. We arrived, in
this instance, at the graveyard just as a compact
collection of cadavers was discussing the forth-
coming fate of the Ministry ; and we could not
fail to be seriously struck with the urbanity of the
dead men in affording one another skull-accom-
modation whenever the henbane was called lor.
We were seated on a grocer’s grave, blinking at
the moonlight, when the evening papers arrived.
We had declined, for the first time in our lives, a
drink. It was nux vomica; but still we felt sad.
Then we watched while a departed elocutionist
read out the paper. We didn’t watch long. Only
until he bad pronounced, with line effect, the first
four lines of the poem. Then the moonlight grew
dark with collar-bones, and we were hit with a
skull harder than our own. We left at this point;
and we left the subject of the lyric still protesting.
We expect—and how pleasantly this varies the
phrase—that he is protesting still.

Here’s a religious item, true as gospel.
In the early days of Bowen (Queensland) Father
M'Ginty (everybody has heard of jolly old “Corner
Allotment”) got a Cardwell boy from Murray—a
Eure myall, known in his native lingo as Thurla-
oona. Father Mac couldn’t think of “lavin’ him
a haythin," so be converted the boy, and christened
him “ Peter,” at the ceremony solemnly warning
him as to what he might expect hereafter if he
forgot his Ave Maria and Paternoster, and exhort-
ing him, whatever else be did, to abstain from
meat on Fridays. To all which, Peter promised
faithful obedience. Next Friday came, and the
priest found the boy (he had his camp at the
end of the old chapel) deeply engrossed in his
simple culinary operations. Curiosity prompted
Inspection. Stepping- over to Peter’s Are, Imagine
i the reverend gentleman’s consternation when ho
found that his proselyte was engaged in grilling a
chunk of fine steak, perhaps two or three pounds in
weight. “ Pater, ye blackguard, what s that ?”
quoth the priest; “ beef ? and this Friday!” “ Baal
that one beef, marmy,” replied the innocent Peter.
“ What, ye black haythen I would ye break the
commandments fornlnst me face, and tell me a lie
foreby ?” To which interogatory his reverence
got for reply: “Baal mine been tell it crammer
Tonga you, marmy; baal that one beef. You see. |
good while ago mine been sit down longa Myall-all
same Thurla Goona; blanbi you been put it water |
longa me, yabber Peter—me Peter, baal Thurla
Goona. All same, before that one bullock; mine
been put It water, yabber 1 fish ’ —that one fish I
Youi, marmy; that one fish—baal beef!” You
could have hoard the priest’s laugh across the Fiat,
at Keith’s store. Peter had his steak.

Reading of Mr. Morrison going to New
Guinea, as the representative of The Aoe (Melb.),
reminds us of the time when we had the New
Guinea craze ourselves. This was years ago, when
we were young and reckless. We were in Mel-
bourne at the time, and made one of a party of
four who proposed to start a company to take
possession of the Island. The other three pro-
moters were of a motley character. One was a
miner, a fine kingly fellow, with schemes as
colossal as his boots; another was a one-eyed but
enthusiastic dipsomaniac, whose Idea of the ex-
pedition was that it would be a glorious mixture
of carnage and rum: the third was a man who had
at one time dined with Dukes and hobnobbed with
Right Honorables, but was then somewhat down
on his luck. Ho, by the way, was the only one of
the party who had ever been nearer New Guinea
than—say Rockhampton, at any rate. One day we
went into his office, and he proceeded to show us a
map he had made of the Northern coast line. His
office was in the back part of a block of buildings
in Coll ins-street. He stood at the far end of the
passage and unrolled the map. It reached right
out to the front door, and was then two hundred
miles short. He then pointed out to us a bay on
the Northern Coast which he had called Milne Bay.
In the middle of this bay was an Island, and on the
island was the picture of a house with a brass plate
on the hall door with the name of our enterprising
friend inscribed upon it. According to scale, this
brass plate must have been about fifty miles long
by thirty wide. He used to speak of this house as
though it were an actual existent fact, and he
would in the course of conversation allude
airily to “my place in New Guinea.” He
had got, somehow or other, the hallucination
that the British Government had made him a grant
of 3000 acres of land in this locality, and he was
very anxious to sell it as it was the sit© of a town-
ship. But he never found anybody that would
trade. So, as a last resource, he proposed to start
a company—money paid In advance—to explore
the country and so bring a white population there.
He had marvellous tales to tell of the mineral
wealth of this wonderful island, and of the mys-
terious race of people who lived away beyond the
mountains in the unknown interior. It is quite
possible he Invented these legends as he went
along, but we were all solemnly impressed with
them. It was decided in council that, when we
had conquered the country, we should make the
Government republican, and that we four should
divide the chief offices of State among ourselves.
There was a rather warm discussion about the
design of the flag we should adopt for our new
State, but we finally decided upon blue devils ram-
pant on a flame-coloured ground with two snakes
as supporters. A prospectus was Issued, in which
it was shown in five colours that a man had only to
invest his money in this speculation to become a
blazing millionaire. Just then it seemed that
people with a little money by them had taken a
violent prejudice against sudden wealt h, and, con-
sequently, we had only one applicant for shares all
the time, and he wound up by borrowing
the price of a bed from the dipsomaniac.
Eheu fugaces / Where are they all now? The
swivel-eyed dipsomaniac we saw a short time ago.
He was then making vigorous efforts to hold up a
lamp-post under the impression that he was a
standard-bearer, and dared not desert his post—we
mean his lamp-post. Our miner friend we have
not seen for a long time: probably he is now on
his way to Purgatory. The promoter and grand
commander-in-chief bled us most effectually.
He himself was, the last time we saw him, a
hotel broker without hotels. And we—by thunder
we are worse off than any of them. We have been
writing, for your delectation, luxurious reader, all
day with a pen in one band and a hammer in the
other, much like the workers of Esdras on the new
temple. We use the hammer to answer the door
with. The moment a man shows his face Inside we
brain him, and bury his body in the back yard. In
the course of time we hope to be able to get rid of
all our creditors in this fashion. In the meantime
we warn Mr. Morrison not to touch our property
in New Guinea.
Certain bank managers, who were resident
for many years in a certain town somewhere south
of the equator, have lately been feted and testi-
raonialised ad nauseam on their removal to another
locality. Is it a mere coincidence that in that town
many business men are on the flit, stations about
changing hands, with other “strange mutations” in
the commercial world, at this particular juncture ?
Rumour says that a well-known telegraphic
official, late of Melbourne but now of 8\ dney, has
invented an instrument that will make “delayed
telegrams ” a thing of the past for ever. Poor
devil! His days are numbered. Jack must not be
as good as his master here, or, at least if he is, he
better keep remarkably quiet about it.
THE BURGLAR’S BRIDE.
He was but a humble burglar,
She a lass of high degree.
Famous but as a gin-gurgler,
And a flre-safe smasher he.
He in Sussex-street resided,
As was fit for one so low;
She at Darling Point abided,
Which for her was commeilfaut.
But they loved each other madly,
With a love that ne’er should cease;
Loved, alas, in secret sadly.
For he dreaded the police.
And he feared her haughty father,
Who would laugh his suit to shame—
Burglary was then a rather
Unremuneratlve game.
And her father, rich and grand, too,
Was director of a bank.
And would only give her hand to—
-■ Well—a. thief of his own rank.
So, you see, the course of true love
Kan as usual with these;
Though they didn’t learn to rue love—
Only bent before the breeze.
For this burglar, though but humble,
Had a high aspiring dream;
Though extremely rough-and-tumble
His ambition you might deem.
Little cared he for transgression
Of the law, but had a fine
Honest pride in his profession.
And an ardent wish to shine.
By his look you’d ne’er be guessing
That beneath an—do not start—
Outside so unprepossessing
Beat so soft and warm a neart.
But it did, and very loudly,
Every time his love he’d meet,
And would tenderly and proudly
Lay his plunder at her feet.
Lo, our pen it lightly hovers
Here, for mem’ry thrills us so;
We ourselves one time were lovers—
One time, very long ago.
And although, poor dear, we killed her
With a brick in course of time,
In sad moments still we build her—
Yes, Indeed—the lofty rhyme.
Ah, those stolen moments—sweetest
Unto him that they were stole—
Strange they always give completest
Joy unto the loving soull
When the moon was brightly beaming,
They would watch her, hand in hand;
For his work was more beseeming
Cloudy nights, you’ll understand.
And each time they came to parting.
These two hearts that knew no $ uile,
He would take with him ere starting,
With a tender, thoughtful smile.
Anything that lay round handy
In the shape of plate, which ne
Said—of thieves he was a grandee—
Took as souvenirs, you see.
So the time wore on, and slowly
As it wore along, by stealth,
Though so humble and so lowly,
He accumulated wealth.
Then her haughty father boldly
Bearded he in his own den,
Who received him somewhat coldly.
But to whom he there and then
Told his tale of love. The old man
Looked him in the eye, did he.
And then said, “You are a bold man
But you are too poor for me.
“ You may have my girl with pleasure
And my blessing with it, ton.
When you can show as much treasure
As I now can show to you.”
On the very next day, lo, there
Came the burglar back once more.
And he emptied out for show there
Notes and gold upon the floor.
Such a pile; the old man, weeping,
Went and called his daughter in,
Gave the maiden to his keeping,
And proposed to keep his “ tin.”
Ah, the poor old man had spoken
Words he never would repent,
For he found his safe was broken,
And he wasn’t worth a cent.
End of it: the burglar, rich in
Lands and goods, made her his bride;
And we think ’twas the Soup Kitchen
Where her poor old father died.

SPORTING AND ATHLETIC MEMS.
Why is a horse the most unhappy creature
existing ? Because so frequently “ the Iron enters
into his sole.”
The first deposit of £100 a side in oonneo
tlon with the intercolonial pigeon match, to come
off on 16th July, has been placed in the hands of
the stakeholder, Mr. W. Sayer.
The proposed match between Hearn, the
champion New Zealand sculler, and Harrington, is
not likely to eventuate, owing to the scullers not
being able to agree as to where the match should
take place.
The Hillston Ananias went out shooting
recently, and when asked what he shot at, replied
a crow. ‘‘Did you hit it?” “Ohlyes.” “Well, where
is it?” “I snot both legs off, replied Ananias.
“ and it flew over yonder and perched in a tree.’’
Fact.
At the Waimate (N.Z.), Steeplechase meet-
ing, Barbary won the principal event, Kosciusko
(the Grand National winner) being second. Out of
a field of six, these were the only two horses that
finished, Wildboy appropriated the Steeplechase
Cup, the crack Clarence, with 13st up, being third.
An Englishman shooting small game in
Germany said to his host that there was a spice of
danger in shooting in America. “Ah!" said the
host, “ you like danger mityour sport. Then you
go out shooting mit me. The last time I shoot my
brudder-ln-law in the schtomack.”
Winter Steeplechase meeting of the Ben-
digo (Vic.) J.C. was held on Wednesday week:—
Hurdle Race; Fusilier, Wild Harry, Stormbird.
Telegraph Stakes : Omadaun, Terminus, Belle
Brandon. Handicap Steeplechase: Yaulter. Sell-
ing Hurdle Race ; Spring, Merry Maid, Little
Annie.
The London World accounts for the up-
ending of English athletes by the fact that “in
matters of sport Britons are now blast." Well, why
the biases didn’t the World tell us that, when Ivo
Bligh’s team trounced “Our Boys” out here, in-
stead of howling the kangaroo dirge and making
a national ass of itself in general ?
The following are the amounts, in round
numbers, of the sums put through the totallsators
by the various New Zealand racing clubs on the
Queen’s Birthday;—Dunedin, £3600; Lower Heath-
cote, £1400; Takapuna, £1000; Grand National,
Tiraaru, £700 ; Wanganui, £400. It rained at every
meeting.
Edward Blackburn, who is matched to
wrestle Professor Miller on the 30th inst. c itcsh-as-
catch-can above the waist, with the use of thcjea£«,
tripping allowed, was born in Cumberla’VtiiV*'.
He is 5ft. 7in. high. 42in. round the chest, w i
13 stone, and is built proportionately. TJ * has a
good record both in England and New Zealand;
The New Zealand Cup weights have beep
issued, but it is generally thought by sporting
scribes there the handicap is not a good one. Mata
and Sir Modred (the latter being now in Sydney),
head the list with 9st61b. Bundoona has9st51b, the
crack three-year-old of the past season; Welcome
Jack, 9st 31b; Lord Burghley, 8st 61b; Jessie, 7st
131b. Altogether, there are 66 at present in the
race.
The backers of Courtney are arranging to
pay Hanlan £1000 to row a race with the U.S.
sculler, and the Hop Bitters Company have pro-
mised to add another thousand—or, as the cable
puts It, “a sculling match is being arranged be-
tween Edward Hanlan, the Canadian oarsman, and
Courtney, the United States sculler. The match is
to be for £1000 a side, the Hop Bitters Company
adding another £1000.” It is to be hoped Courtney
will be able to find a whole boat to row this race
in.
The sparring mania has reached Louth,
where a match was announced to take place at
Morrison’s Room between two well-known ama-
teurs, for a £30 trophy. A goodly crowd gathered
to see the fun, but were doomed to disappoint-
ment, as the police put a stop to the proceedings.
This was pretty rough on the Louth sports, con-
sidering that the Inspector-General “took the
chair” at the recent Miller-Foley bout.
Mr. W. H. Brewer, in the American Jour-
nal of Science, shows conclusively how the trot-
ting horse of that country is a new species in the
course of evolution. The horse known to us does
not trot when it wishes to go at its highest speed,
but by artificial selection such a breed is being
evolved in America. In this new species, of course
the muscles are very differently developed and to
some extent the bones. The record in speed in
these animals is lessened—the time taken, that is—
every year.
Mr. Alfred Austin, of Dunedin, N.Z., re-
cently received from John Rayner, of Melbourne,
a challenge to walk young Scott a match of either
twenty-four or forty-eight hours for £100 a-side;
the match to take place in Victoria. Rayner writes
that he would walk the match in N.Z. but for his
impression that he would not find backers in a
strange place. Young Scott is engaged in business
in Dunedin, and Mr. Austin has written that he
will give the sum of £100 to be competed for by
Raynor and Scott in Dunedin, so that the difficulty
of finding backers will be overcome.
If common report is to be believed, the
London clubs are not in a healthy condition. It
may be gratifying to police-officers to have a new
field of duty open to them, but it cannot be a
cause of congratulation to fashionable coteries
that the presence of police-officers in their midst
is necessary. It is actually said that the clubs
have to employ detectives to examine every set of
dice used in the club-houses. The Inference is
that these establishments are visited by persons,
either members or guests, who have a penchant
for “ ringing in ” loaded dice.
Said an Adelong youngster to a well-known
fowl-fancier, the other day: “I don’t like that
small white deaf ear your so-called game cocks
have—they look to me as if they had been crossed
with the black Spanish.” “well,” replied the
fowley one, “they might have been, but you know
you can’t boat the Spanish fowl for fighting.”
“ Spanish good for fighting! never heard of such a
thing,” said Bob. “What, Robert, Spanish cocks
no good for fighting! Why, good gracious, did
you never hear tell of the Spanish Main ?”
At Miller’s benefit at the Princess Theatre,
Melbourne, H. M. Cansdell performed on the
parallel and horizontal bars and shouldered up
1301 b. The “Professor” is now trying to arrange
a match between Victor, the wrestler and athlete,
and what he—surely jokingly—terms Sydney’s
amateur weight-lifter and wrestler, for a gold
medal and a side bet of £35. Cansdell has been sail-
ing very close to the wind, and should this match
be arranged it is certainly time he dropped the
amateur business—not that he will suffer by the
alteration, for as things now go we should consider
our little pot as sate on a pro. as an amateur.
Here is the sort of trash that gorgeous
fossil, the Maitland Mercury, which prides Itself
on being the leading provincial paper in the colony,
prints as an obituary rhyme on the death of
Tommy Moore, the jockey:—
“ It was on the 34th of May
Poor Tommy, he rode, his last day;
We all wish him to Heaven bona fide,
No more on earth a race he’ll ride.
The natux-e of the accident
Was very sad indeed;
No time was left him to repent—
Mayhap he did not need.”
If poor Tommy could only “ resurrect,” he would
undoubtedly make the mummy who edits the M.M.
beat the best record ever made by a thorough-
bred.
The performances of our footballers can
be depended upon about as much as those of our
amateur scullers. On Moore Park, last Saturday
afternoon, the Wallaroos—who have this season
been beaten by nearly all the suburban clubs—de-
feated the crack University team by seven points
to two. The ’Varsity men, as usual, take their
groats very badly; and say the umpire did not give
them fair play. The East Sydney v. Waratah
match, also played on Moore Park, resulted in a
decided victory for Bast Sydney by 2 goals 14
behinds to 1 behind. At St. Leonards the Kedferns
beat the local team by 9 points to nil. And at
Burwood the Balmaln-Burwood match resulted in
a draw, much in favour of the Ipcal team.
The Morphettville (Adelaide) races came off
on Wednesday last, 3000 spectators being present.
Hurdles: Lady Carrington, Anon, Rifleman. Seven
ran. The betting was 7 to 4 against Lady Carring-
ton, who won very easily Selling Race: Cardinal,
Lawn, Hawthorn. The Cup: Israelite, Agitation,
Totallsator. Valerie, Mesalliance, Leap Year, and
Sardines also started. Betting was even on Israel-
ite, 3 to 1 against Totalisator and Agitation.
Israelite won by a length. Steeplechase : Tarax-
acum, Joker, Bob Cooper. Eight horses started.
The betting was 2 to 1 against Taraxacum, 3 to
1 against Bob Cooper, 4 to 1 against Joker, 5 to 1
against Premier. Taraxacum won by half a
neck. Premier fell. Handicap: Topaz, Country
Boy, Virtue. Ten started. The betting was 5 to
2 against Pride of Troy, 3 to 1 against Virtue,
Topaz won by a head. The same distance between
the second and third horses. Time, Imin. SJfjsec.
Last Thursday our “Mr, Loftus” inspected
the celebrated “ trotters ” (not sheep’s) of Victoria
in the Albert Park, being chaperoned for the time
by Lord Normanby. Honesty, Ajax, Len Rose,
Contractor, Boccaccio, Defiance (imported), and a
crowd of colonial-breds, were trotted out before
him —double J. Miller kindly pointing out each
beauty’s good points as they passed. His Excel-
lency took a great interest in the close of the per-
formance, and expressed his opinion that if the
black-red Brama-Pootra Clydesdale were crossed
with the thoroughbred Arab Dorking the result
of the clutch would lay over anything this side of
the equinoctial line. Old man F. Robins, who was
tooling Defiance along, raised a roar by reining up
and informing His Excellency—“ This ’ere Defiance
is nineteen year old last foalin’: he can show a
record of 2 min. 19i sec., an’ he’s fit either to haul a
plough or carry the missus an’ me t’ market.”
Then giving the veteran his head, the driver
screamed, “ An’, look here, I’ll trot th’ fastest ’oss
in th’ colonies with him now; so, it yer on, old cock,
git out yer blessed ‘ duster.’ ’
Should Mitchell, the English champion, and
J. L. Sullivan meet in America, there may be a
chance of deciding the much-vexed question as to
what chance a first-class middle-weight would have
against a really good big-un. Many have been the
opinions of late days regarding the claims of Eng-
land’s pugilistic champions. It has been said that
Tom Sayers stood unequalled by any one of his
Eredecessors, but this would appear to come more
rom enthusiastic admirers than from cool think-
ing men able to judge in these matters. To us it
would appear physically unreasonable to expect
anyone of Sayers’ weight to have coped success-
fully against such men as Jem Belcher, Tom Cribb,
Pearce the “Game Chicken,” and many other big
men, not forgetting that 14 st. of strength and
muscle, Molyneaux the Black. Coming down to
a later date, take that surprising man, Jem Ward
—surely no middle-weight could have had
the slightest chance with him, nor did Randall
or Young Dutch Sam, even with their great
powers, ever think of looking above their own
middle-weight. Sayers and Mace were champions,
because in their day there were only a few stale
heavy men such as Paddock, The Tipton, and a few
others who fought young riddle-weights in their
prime and were defeated. When America sent
Heenan over to wrest the championship from
Sayers, after three hours’ fighting, the contest
ended in a draw, and immediately after Heenan
ran a considerable distance from the ring, and on
coming back declared he was fresher than before
the fight. But mark the difference. When he fought
Tom King, he was in less than three-quarters of an
hour literally smashed, and lay on the ground
Insensible, in a most deplorable and dangerous
condition. Surely this would show there must
have been a great difference in the two men
Heenan faced. In the palmy days of pugilism no
middle-weight would have had the audacity to
tackle a first-class big man; and should Mitchell
and Sullivan meet, provided the latter is fit and
well, we do not think it will be found that the old-
time dictum has at all altered.
Here is a gory story. On 20th April, near
Philadelphia, Jemmey Dewees, an ex- pugilist, find-
ing that one of two dogs which had been matched
to fight did not show up, offered to fight the other,
Grip, himself., This startling proposition was made
to a partv whose instiucts made them ready to ac-
cept anything in tne shape of what they termed
“sport.” It was accepted viva voce, and p-epara-
tions were at once begun for the unequal match.
Dewecs divested himself of everything save his
shirt and pantaloons, and his pockets wore turned
inside out to prevent the concealment of any
weapon. The dog Grip was thoroughly washed in
lukewarm water and milk, in the same manner as
though he were to meet a tour-legged antagonist.
Soon after midnight, Dewees, who ha 1 bwped him
self up with several drinks of whisky, j i led into
the pit and announced himself read Jr Grl Vs
handler followed a few minutes later Uj*-
headed pet. Dewees knelt on one knCc in UKT
corner Intended to have been occupied by “ Wel-
lington 2d.” No referee had been appointed in the
excitement of the moment, and half a dozen men
began yelling, “ Let him go I let him go !” the
moment the dog made its appearance. Baying
loudly, and with bloodshot eyes glaring. Grip
sprang forward the instant the handler loosed his
hold. Dewees met the attack by seizing the dog by
the throat. The handler then jumped out of the pit
and took his place among the spectators. Through
nervousness or lack of strength, Dewees lost his
hold, and in the twinkling of an eye Grip had
him by the calf of the leg. The man gave a howl
of pain as the brute’s tangs sank deep into the
tt sh, and he began pounding the dog on the head
wit i his fists. This produced not the slightest
effect, and Dewees made an effort to get at the
dog’s throat. I i this he was partly successful, and
managed to c idee his four-legged antagonist
hard enough to compel him to momentarily re-
linquish his hold. Again did the man’s strength
give out, and again was he seized by the leg The
vicious brute seemed content to hang on and chow,
and paid no attention to the shower of blows
ra ned on his ribs by the frantic Dewees. The
spectators yelled and clapped their hands as the
man, almost mad with pain and rage, succeeded in
getting hold of Gripp’s foreleg, and twisting it
until it was dislocated at the shoulder. Then, with
a mighty effort, Dewees freed himself from the
dog’s hold, and, as the maddened brute re-
turned to the charge, he received a kick under
the jaw, which sent him spinning against the side
of the pit. Dewees ran forward with the blood
streaming from his leg, and jumped on the dog’s
prostrate body. This almost finished the terrible
display. The handler leaped into the pit to rescue
Grip from what seemed certain death. Dewees,
thoroughly infuriated, kept kicking at and jump-
ing on the dog, despite the efforts of the handler
to prevent him. Grip, struggled to his feet,
and, game to the last, fastened his fangs in
the leg of his would-be protector who hap-
Bened to be standing nearest. This gave
•ewees another opporf unity, and he broke the
dog’s jaw with a well-directed kick. The specta-
tors cried, “Enough,” and the dying animal,
although valued at one hundred and fifty dollars,
was given his quietus with a black bottle. This is
almost up to “Amateur Casual’s” Man-and-Dog-
fight yarn.

SOCIAL.
The shortest day in the year, and the
shiniest night. Just lovely was that calm, bright,
moonlit atmosphere last Thursday night, when
the cabs and carriages brought their couples and
coteries up to the “Mercantile.” With the orb of
Dlan right at its golden full, and the still air tem-
perate to a degree, no wonder that, to elated
belledom, and Just for a time, it seemed as if the
world was created by infinite love as a place to
dance in; and that young fellows could only look
on girls as pretty things created by infinite love on
purpose to dance with. The patrons of the M.H.C.
Ball are mostly youthful. It is true a lot of people
who are eminently solid and almost sere are
supposed to patronise it; but no one sees much of
them—except in the preliminary advertisements.
And it is quite true that lots of people who were
never able, or were never allowed to dance, or who
have become too old or too stiff, too fat or too good
to dance, naturally view with charitable pity those
who can and do dance; and look down on the art
with general contempt. But the young on.'S live
on, all the same, in their absence, and love one
another, and laugh and enjoy life—Father Henne-
berry and his followers notwithstanding. Possibly,
some of them even dare to hope for heaven. So
the folks streamed in at the southern door, and the
porch was soon full of a smiling, chatty crowd.
There, on one side, were the youths complacently
smoothing their fingers as they waited for the
ladies to come cut; a few in fancy dress, who
found themselves too famous, and wished people
wouldn't look at them so fixedly; and a great band
of “Johnnies ” in general, exhibiting newly shaven
chins and shiny pumps, with continents of shirt-
front and isthmuses of “old chappie” collars. And
there, on the other band, were the hanging
draperies that shut from view the Adamless
Eden—the garden of girls who were “doing
themselves up.” It is a wonderful enigma
what it is ladies get doing in a cloak-room
that seems to prevent them ever coming cut
again under thirty-five minutes!—especially as
they are supposed to be dressed to the final pin
before they go there. Hairpins, beads, bits of
elastic, and lace lingerie do seem to require an
interminable amount of “ fixing "—though, of
course, time is a mere nothing when you consider
the result attained. However, at last the elabora-
tions were finished, and the gay and smiling
demoiselles tripped with their cavaliers into the
ballroom, hundreds of them, until the building was
nicely full. 1 There was no crush. Now, we are
expected to say something about this ball; to tell
who were there, what they wore, how thev looked,
what they did, and so on; in fact, Just furnish a
full and faithful report, the same as if we’d been
Inspecting an Industrial college. It is an unhappy
task; at the very outset, we are like the progres-
sive boy at Sunday-school, “ beset with snares on
every hand.” Some people are so sensitive. It we
don’t enthuse over a “ red and yaller ” terror as the
fair wearer herself does, we always have to cross
the street when we see her coming, for six
months afterwards: and if we just hint to a young
man—who thinks himself a perfect comet in the
terpstchorean atmosphere—that the whole art of
dancing does not consist in chipping corners off
other people, he at once takes the matter up as
personal, and talks Miller. To any intelligent and
trusted reporter, who always fails utterly when he
tries to please people by skilfully-invented lies, it
is very painful to be placed in this position. But
there are topics which we must touch on, no
matter what the consequence—topics as irresistible
as they are Inexhaustible; and as long as human
nature remains the same, “dress” will be one of
them. Two sisters from Church Hill wore the
most beautiful evening dresses at the ball. Miss H.
Parry had a rich creation of cream brocade and
cream satin; the front of skirt was covered with
real duchesse lace, between the rows were rows of
pearl lace, giving a striking effect, and under
the duchesse were rows of very large pink
roses showing the shade of pink just peeping
through. The train, caught up at the side by
one immense pink rose, was separate from the
skirt, that is, fastened on to the waist merely, and
lined with pale pink satin all through, so that when
held up it displayed the delicate glimmer of the
pink; gold lace round the edge. Round the neck
was a ruffle of real lace, with roses between each
quilling. Plumage of pink feathers in the hair.
Miss M. Parry had a primrose satin, with a kind of
golden cream to match, brocaded with lilies of the
valley. The front skirt was primrose satin, having
alternate rows of Jet fringe and lace, headed with
a cluster of white Jet roses and golden leaves, in
form of an apron ; at the sides were panels of
beautiful white Jet. The bodice was trimmed
with white Jet roses and lace; and the train, com-
ing from the front, was cut up at bottom so as to
form a row of leaves, and was bordered with real
gold lace. Clusters of dark red leaves on the front
of dress, on the sleeves, and in the hair. An ex-
ceedingly handsome dress was of rich cardinal
satin, covered with thin black lace, through which
the cardinal glinted with tine effect. A brunette,
Miss Pooley, wore a dress all of pretty buttercup
silk. Miss Payne, in a short Spanish costume of
black lace, without any colour whatever, but cut
low to show a pair of beautiful shoulders, had
chosen what was exquisitely suitable to her,
and many favourable remarks wore made compli-
mentary to her taste. A builder’s daughter was
pretty in blue satin and pale pink roses, edgings of
white lace; Miss Pinnington, in blue satin, with
basketof flowers and largo straw, was Josephine.
One Folly was in pale pink and blue with bells,
and another in bright yellow bodice, blue skirt,
with yellow stars having bells at the points—a nice
combination of colours and rather novel. Very
prominent, by reason of its colour, was a terra
cotta broch<i sparely trimmed with delicate ficelle
lace; little Miss Thompson made a dear Ruth, and
lightning dancer; and a pretty music teacher in a
fllagreed blue was a sprightly partner; Miss
Walker took the name of La Belle Heine, in a
handsome fancy garb of black velvet bodice hung
with crimson pompons and bunched behind,
crimson satin skirt trimmed with white lace. Miss
Coombe wore one of the finest evening dresses—a
rich ruby velvet bodice with back bunching and
side paniers caught up with pearl brooches, a
dainty straw-coloured skirt, and golden pearls
strung in her dark hair ; Mrs. Lawrence
exhibited a neat fancy dress of old gold satin
and purple; and a perfect little Hebrew dancer
flitted, fairy-like, in lavender and white, which
combined well with her brunettish charms. A
pretty little Woollahra blonde wore a white satin,
that was good In everyway, and quilted In squares
and other “ pretties.” Two sisters, lately from the
southern capital, came from North Kingston—one
in ca dinal satin, the other in cream; both attrac-
tive. A Mounted Trooper, who was very youthful,
seemed all boots. Mis. Walsh wore a tine dress of
pale blue brooW, with train, skirt looped up at one
side with roses, lace trimming, and n ruche and row
ot ipses round the bottom. “Little Nell” was a
good-sized girl, of substantial formation, who wore
a dress of black and old gold—and a deadly smile,
and a skipping-rope. Miss M’Laren wore an admir-
able costume as a Huntress; double-breasted jacket
of grey cloth with large buttons and short maroon
skirt, three-cornered hat with a plume, riding boots
spins, and whip. Miss Adrain was neat in claret
velvet bodice, tails, and pale pink satin skirt, har-
moniously trimmed. There were two or three
Americas; some youths who looked extremely
amuwui as Footballers, and others as Brigands,
Burglars, and so on, who could not keep their Wig-
zell moustaches on their downy lips. One young
gentleman’s style of skylarking was so lofty and
vigorous that he danced himself right off his feet
beside the fountain; but the floor is fortunately so
strong there that he didn’t go through. By the way,
there was, as usual, a large number of these em-
phatic dancers present, whom ordinary people
whose lives are uninsured, have to watch with the
greatest care. There’s an uncertainty of purpose
in the movements of the typical emphatic dancer
which makes it very puzzling to determine in what
direction ho s trying to go, or which leg will fly up
next and whiz past your elbow. We meet this
dancer everywhere, our ankles testify to his active
exertions, and the shredded skirts of unfortunate
ladles who have been in his vicinity bear witness
to his presence. He makes the “grand chain” a
circus performance of the most exciting sort, and
he practices a polka with all the vehemence ot a
cavalry charge. To him and his kind we offer “ a
little thing of our own ”
When each hoof with violence goes,
When our ribs each elbow pokes,
When heels do-drop on our toes
With a weight like any moke’s.
We think of thee!
When we’re black and blue from blows,
When we’ve bumped by blundering blokes,
When we’ve torn and draggled clo’es,
When we get too sad for Jokes,
We think of thee!
When a man has got the “slows,”
And his see-saw quite provokes.
When he kicks a lady’s hose,
Works her arm with pump-like strokes,
We think of thee I
Oh I we trust, at last—who knows ?—
There a home for these good folks,
Where the cheerful charcoal (flows,
And the stoker gently stokes
E-ter-nal-lee I
Mrs. Zions wore a cardinal satin overskirt, with
yandyked body, and gathered black skirt, white
lace trimmings. Miss Mcrrifleld was the perfec-
tion of a dainty dancer all in white satin and
pearls; Mrs. Cantor wore a rich maroon velvet,
and pale pink satin skirt; Miss Carroll, cream satin
ot great richness, strewn with pearls and strings
of flowers; Mrs. Kurts, a tine dark maroon brocht 1 ,
the bodice edged with white pompons, and white
lace on the skirt; Miss Goodman, a maroon velvet
tunic, pale pink satin skirt trimmed with passe-
menterie and red berries, and touched off with
crimson feathers, which also formed a head-dress.
Miss Hyara was Nancy Lee, in a very tasteful
costume. Miss Levy displayed a good white satin
with pearl sleeves, and pale blue skirt. “ Marie
Stuart” shone pre-eminent for the correctness of
her beautiful historical character, and bore her
regal robes with truly queenly grace. And few
faces are more graciously fair than hers: —
Just such a face as Wordsworth would
In verse have painted;
A face not only fair, but good,
One semi-sainted.
A face where gentleness by truth
Is well attended;
A face where beauty, grace, and youth,
Are softly blended.
A face that sets the thoughts ateem
In fancy spinning,
To try and find what makes it seem
So very winning.
One character was a Culgoa Gentleman, which we
suppose is a new sort of gentleman. He's quite
welcome; there is plenty of room for him in
Sydney. Miss Ag. Tighe s yachting costume of
white, with blue collar, &c., and saucy hat, was
both neat and pretty, and her dancing the same.
A maroon satin (gloves to match) and tablier of
terra cotta brocht adorned a clever dancer. About
midnight, a considerable accession to the ball came
in the shape of a party from the Opera, all in fancy
garb. There was Power, lank and funny in black
velvet tights, as an Aesthete, just flopped out of
the quadrille: Deane Brand, as a Prince; then
Manola: the Girl in Chintz; Ophelia; Mr. Wilson
as Don Galabazas; Mr. J, Eramerson as Miguel, in
“Manola;” and Miss Eramerson as Fanchette, al
helping to heighten the gayness of the scene. Miss
Kate Chard wore black bodice, red and white
striped skirt, and immense roses, as Bulotte, and
with her partner attracted a knot of admirers
to view a new rendering of the Highland
Schottische, with a good deal of fling in it.
Miss Schroeder was Coquette, Miss John-
ston Dorothy, in “King's Dragoons;” Mrs. W. H.
McCarthy, Lady Archibald Campbell; Mr. H.
E.. Paul. Ambassador; Mrs. J. Smart, Star ;
Miss L. Hurcott, Ruth; Mrs. Evans,a Reaper; Mrs.
M'Shane, a Grecian Lady; Mrs. J. Phelps, Folly;
Miss J. Bull, Highland Lassie; one Miss Long
Pa ;ience: and another a charming Spanish Lady;
Miss Duff, Starlight: Mrs. J. Duffin, Star; Mr. H.
Sutton, Russian Pirate; Miss Pascoe, Highland
Lassie; Miss L. M‘Kenny, Mischief; Miss Chapman,
Tambourine Girl; Mr. A, Dransfleld, Manrlco; Mr.
Dwyer, Bunthorne; Mrs. Hunt, Spanish Gipsy;
Miss Barron, Union Jack; Miss Harris, Claudine;
Mrs. Archibald, Clairette; Mr. H. M. Dennis,
Prince of Night; Miss Tighe, Daughter of the
Regiment; and Miss St. Clair, Folly. Altogether
the gathering of fancy characters was very as-
sorted, and some well-designed costumes were
amongst them. Miss Rmilie Davies looked charm-
ing in one of the few creations that were really
original, namely, that of Redfern Footballer-
jersey bodice of navy blue, with sash having “ Red-
fern ’ on it in gold letters; skirt, just long enough
to be proper, and short enough to be pretty,
made of llama in alternate blue and white
stripes, dark blue hat trimmed with white satin.
Her sister, Eva, made a delicious Fanchette in crim-
son satin and croam, with lots of flowers. Lieut.
Wilson appeared in his uniform of the Torpedo
Corps; Mr. Robert Kurts was Capt. Molyneux of
the 41st; his sister, very handsome in cardinal
satin. Miss M. Eastway was Flametta ; Miss E.
Brooks, well made up as Lizzie Stofel; Mr. R. M.
Griffiths, Spanish Gondolier: Miss Merrick, Night;
Miss Croft, Pearl; Miss Murray, Hungarian Girl,
a good make up of black velvet, with red under-
skirt, a peculiar cape hanging from the shoulder,
lined with red and trimmed with fur, square-
topped black velvet hat crossed with silver cords,
boots to match the character. Mr. Brigson was a
Mexican Scout; Mr. Booth, Bombastes; Mr. B.
Hicks, a Barber’s Pole; Mr. J. Wilson, a Brigand
of 17th Century; and a well-taken character was
that of Beatrix in “ Manola,” the well-known dress
of green and gold satin. The sister of a runner
was very piquant in a low-cut cream silk, trimmed
with lace, gathered skirt and train, and was
a graceful dancer, Mrs. Carugati wore a
superior cream satin, with a regal train, and
trimmings of rich crimson brocade and flowers.
Among the dancers who were noticed for their
grace were Miss White, of Bourke-street, in blue,
who “trips the light fantastic’’ better than old
Milton could ever imagine; and little Miss (Sebas-
tian) Hodge, also in blue; and a petite young lady
in simple black brocht. Also a little blonde, with
a pathetic face, in white and crimson and gold, and
the varied gay colours that make a ,r Grecian
Girl.” That’s what she said she was, though we
don’t believe Greek names, as a rule, begin with
Me. Titania, Queen of Fairies, could scarce have
had lighter feet—lighter than anything we can
think of just now, except, perhaps, a poet’s head.
So light—
We’d like to be a tiny flower,
Hid in the grass;
Awaiting patiently each hour
For her to pass.
And when she came upon her walk
We’d hang our head.
Her foot would hardly bend a stalk,
So light its tread!
O, little blonde, ere you depart.
Hear this our prayer—
Dance light, you’re dancing on our heart,
Sweet thing of air I
Half of the gallery was packed for some hours
with spectators, who enjoyed the kaleidoscopic
scene, among them being a clerical gentleman of
the Wesleyan persuasion. Flags of all clubs were
used to adorn the building, also sculls, and at one
end a number of them spread out fan-like, over a
gas star, made quite an oar-ora of light. A basket
was placed at the door for lost programmes, which
proved very useful, and the hat registry and other
conveniences were well arranged. The City Cater-
ing Company provided the supper tables in a satis-
factory way, and Messrs. Murray and Blackstone,
secretaries, and Mr. Bull, treasurer, were very busy
in endeavouring to see that all went smoothly.

A powerful motive—loeo-motive.
The Riverina squatters can certainly count
some mean men amongst their number. One
known as Hungry measured off a load of wood
that had been loaded green from the mill, and
actually deducted the freight from the carriers
for shrinkage. Another was known to carry Ids
clothes on his head and swim his horsw over a
river to save the pnncage, and now boasts that he
can travel a thousand miles with two shillings in
his pocket and have one loft at the end of the
journey.
The following flattering tale is told of a
certain Circus company now corruscating up
North. The knights of the spangles and sawdust
were once once encamped near Louth, and, falling
in with one of the local magnates, they gave a free
exhibition of some of their daring feats in a hotel
yard. Being a good sort, the Louth man. on taking
his departure, said to the proprietor, “ Send one or
two of your men across to my place, and I’ll give
you a couple of good fat sheep just lit for cooking;
I'spose your people can eat, can’t they?” “We-ell,
yes they can, sir,” replied the other, as he stroked
his chin meditatively; “but, Lor’ bless yer heart,
y’ oughter see ’em drink, sir.” The hint was
gripped, and joy reigned around.

no “living human being” would dare decide
which was most charming, when all looked so
well A married blonde lady was stately in green-
ish black velvet, and light pink satin brochd,
Elizabethan lace collar. Two young ladles, from
Bourke and Crown streets, were both blonde,
pretty, lively, and perfect dancers. An Elizabeth-
street lady wore a conspicuously good dress of old
gold hung with black lace and pompons, with a
tabll’er that was a mass of mysterious millinery
such as no pen could put into words; and a tall
brunette was dressed all in chaudron satin. Flow-
ered fawn ottoman, and skirt of white satin and
lace decked a handsome Darlington blonde; and
a young lady with wavy hair and a bird-like name
wore ridges of swansdown on a blue bodice and
sleeves, and a ficelle skirt of finely gathered nun’s
veiling. A piquant little Hebrew lady displayed a
kind of creamy ficelle silk, beautifully made, with
long train; and a builder’s daughter was very
pretty in pink satin and nun’s veiling. A tall,
musical young lady danced charmingly in cream
with a golden band around; and a tall brunette
wore a dress of rich broch4 and satin, a “ straw-
berry duet." Another dual harmony was in blues
—indigo and a deep azure tint, set off
with white beads and lace, extremely hand-
some. From Darling Point a young lady came,
in a very pretty dress of fawn am; salmon-n nk
striped satin, brcche skirt to suit, and wreath of
flowers. A Randwick lady wore a splendid cos-
tume of shrimp pink satin with hanging pompons,
and garlanded with grass and water-lilies. Two
sisters from “Hillside,” Annandale, were simply
pretty in cream broehi and nun’s ciorh, with just a
tinge of cardinal; with a jovial military gentleman
in spurs in close attend mce. The genial Mayor of
Wollongong was present with a coterie from St.
Leonards. And from that suuurb came a little
belle (some said the) who was just piquancy itself,
in a dress of perfect simplicity, white and light as
a snowflake—not a tinge of colour, that would
have spoiled it all—a saucy face, and brown hair
tumbled up cleverly on to a little Grecian head;
and there you have the devastating picture. The
ball-treasurer exerted himself looking after visi-
tors who did not belong to the craft; and his wife
was charming in a sleeveless cream ottoman silk,
trimmed with pearls and looped up with roses.
From Woollahra, a pink cashmere and ruby plush
dress, trimmed with oriental lace, was very hand-
some; as was also, from thence, a o;air fraise nun’s
cloth decked with Spanish lace. A rather pretty
girl had the misfortune to dance clean through
er shoes at the start, and was consequently dls-
;abled during the rest of the evening. Her first
ball, too. On, ye tears! There was a large attend-
ance of visitors in the gallery, and some stayed
there till well on in the morning. Many prominent
politicians took part in the ball, which ended after
. 3 a.m. The cloak arrangements, programmes, etc,,
were quite satisfactory. Compagnoni catered an
i excellent supper under the galleries, and the traffic
, officials outside, under the eleotri o lamps, managed

Mr. and Mrs. Robert Hudson entertained a
number of friends at “ Fairmount,” Ashfleld, on
Thursday evening last. The party met to celebrate
l iable event, the anniversary of the host’s eldest
daughter's birthday, and the opening of a hand-
some ballroom, which has recently been added to
“Fairmount.” The room, approached through a
well-appointed conservatory, is one of the best of
its kind in the suburb, being of capital size, and
the floor is not likely to be other than first-class,
laid by one of the Hudson Brothers. Its decora-
tions are also artistic. Dancing, with music at
Intervals, kept everyone happy and busy.

Hope springs eternal in the red-haired
girl’s breast. Humming Bee comes to her aid with
this crumb of comfort:—“ There are some whose
creamy skins and delicate rose-leaf colour are
always accompanied by distinctly red hair. Even
friends can’t call it auburn, and its possessors too
often find it a source ot unmitigated vexation.
But one lady made strength of her weakness by
scattering upon her rod locks golden dust till it
gleamed a dull golden red, such as you see low on
the horizon before rain comes after prolonged
heat, and one envied the happy possessor of hair
which looked like that of one of Titian’s pictures.”

“Pschutt” is the latest word. We admit
we don’t know what it means, and don’t believe
anyone else does. It is ugly to look at, and slangy
to speak; but as it has “come in,” we are deter-
mined to grapple with it, if wo drive ourselves
into an early orthoepical grave in the attempt.
PSchutt” is being used in the place of “chic;”
mot'that it means exactly the same, but it is a cog-
hate expression. It means ease, taste, talk, dress,
acts; all must be perfect, yet the individuality ot
the person still preserved, and en Evidence. To say
that one is “pschutt” is to say that he or she has
reached the extreme of what Is desirable in
“society,” nnd stands on the very peak of fashion.
It has not been defined exactly to what lengths a
person can go before he steps over the edge of
‘pschutt.” It is possible to bo born “pschutty,”
but wealth is absolutely essential to it. It is
“ pschutt” in Paris to have your coat-of-arms em-
broidered on the back of your gloves, also to take
morphia, to wear a white waistcoat with jewelled
buttons for evening dress, to be limp from the
waist up and wear garments as close and crease-
less as a coat of paint from the waist down. One
deflner says “pschutt” is “the mirror of fashion
—not more, nor loss; ” and another says, “pschutt”
is “a flower of brains softened by dissipation.”

Here is a new game very popular with
the girls but not at all to the liking of
the young men when they discover the point. The
girls sit in one room In a row, with a chair in front
of each one. The young men are stationed in an-
other room, and are brought in one by one. When
be comes in, the youth chooses his chair, and the
young lady behind him binds his eyes with a hand-
kerchief. Then the Chinese cook comes in and
kisses him, and disappears. The young man is
released, feeling much refreshed and elated, and
promptly returns to the other end of the room.
His feelings when the next young man comes in
and is treated to this novel entertainment, can be
imagined; but they are mitigated by the pleasure
of seeing the other fellows undergoing the same
experiment. As a winter evening amusement it
is one of the most popular.

Below are some observations quoted from
the S.F. Newsletter on the objectionable style ot
some dancers, which comes appropriately under
the title of “ public hugging,” We quote, not
because the remarks arc exactly apposite to any-
thing that exists in Sydney, but, firstly, as a fore-
warning ; and, secondly, because they will bear
application, though in a manner somewhat different
from that originally intended. They open upon
what is termed “ that amalgamation of abomina-
tions at present known in society as the Hop
Waltz,” and continue : “ With its amorous atti-
tudes, its clinging pressure of form to form, and
its spasmodic wriggling still fixed upon our nau-
seated mental retina, we confess that several terms
more apt than printable have suggested them-
selves. But, after much deliberation, hugging
has seemed to be the only word both applicable
and fit for publication, though with pain we
acknowledge the weakness of its Incompleteness
to describe the many objectionable ingredients
of the disgusting dance The
slow and graceful movement of feet in perfect
time to music, satisfactory enough in the past, is
now voted slow and insipid by our fob-chained,
ear-whiskered, and tight-pantalooned young men:
they require something more blood-heating aud
exciting to attract their downy presence at a ball.
The old-fashioned redowa, and smooth-gliding
deux-temps did well enough for their cold-blooded
fathers, who were content to place their arm
around a lady’s waist, and, giving it no more
pressure than the exigencies of proper guiding
required, so complete the dance, Ignorant—or at
least unconscious—of any other personal contact
with their partner than the light touch of arm or
hand. But by them much more is desired, and
from all appearances the limit of desire in that
direction has been adequately reached in the Hop.
To fully describe the Hop, as it is danced to-day in
our ballrooms by sensual-mouthed, dissipated-eyed
young men, and apparently clean-minded aud in-
nocent-hearted young girls, would be a task for
the doing of which we proudly admit our inability.
But we have stood night after night watching the
degrading spectacle, until we have been happy in
the reflection that we were daughterless ourselves,
though the thought would at times steal in upon
us what supreme delight it would be, had we a
daughter and found her in the sorry plight we
mention, to have summarily lifted by his ear and
kicked from our presence the man who would have
dared to offer her such unpardonable Insult.”
Now, we have not the Hop Waltz here, or the
racquet. By all the leading teachers a smooth,
free glide is taught, where no contact is necessary,
and there is nothing objectionable. The only per-
sons who hop are those who cannot dance; aud the
only persons who cling are those who cannot
behave. But—and here comes the application—we
have a style of polkaiug which, as it is done by
many, nearly takes the place of the objectionable
Hop Waltz of America: a style of horseplay and
indiscriminate plunging that is devoid of grace on
the part of the performers, and productive of
bumps and discomfort to everyone else. And we
have a style of waltz, aptly described as the
“Chandelier Crawl,” which, though “theslowand
graceful movement of feet in time to music” is
preserved, is yet, in another aspect, as indecent as
any racquet can be. While other people glide
round and about the room, the pair of chandelier
crawlers monopolise the centre—she clinging to
him, he pressing to her with careful solicitude;
and as they dawdle slowly around, scarcely moving
from the one spot, both present, in their sandwich-
like adherence, a perfect illustration ot “ hugging
in public.” A woman who could see her daughter
thus held must be very complaisant. If this par-
ticular crawl were confined only to a certain class,
it would be hardly worth while noticing, for there
is a favourite adage that you cannot make a silk
purse out of an unsuitable material. But this par-
ticular crawl is to seen almost everywhere, aud
flourishes in good private houses, where the
hostess, relying on the status of her guests, fails
to critically discriminate the exact moment when
decency is overstepped; or, even if she notices,
finds it a difficult task to frame a remonstrance.
One thing 1s fortunate: the specimen dancers who
thus behave are but a small minority, and they
capijQt increase unless ladies want them to.

One Incident resultant from the Albury
banquet was a ge; lal little tea party given last
week by Mr. Quong Tart in the Royal Arcade, to a
ootorio ot Victorian visitors; among the guests
being Mr. Bussell, M.P. for Ballarat East, the
Mayor of that place, two or ‘hree in ning gentle-
men, Messrs. Withers, and Sydney pressmen. It
was very sociable; a dainty tea was spread and the
wants of guests attended to by the neat
who act as ministers of grace in the scone depart-
ment of Mr. Tart’s house. After tea, wine came
on, and Mr. Tart proposed the “Queen;” Mr.
Withers followed with “ Visitors from Victoria.”
to which the Mayor and the M.P. humourously
replied. The host sang a comic song, which wus
considerably funny, and his health was heartily
toasted. Mr. Quong made a sensible speech on the
“Press,” confessing that it had always put a fair
amount of “jam” on his "tart,” and after replies
from the editor of the Ballarat Star and others,
the tea party diffused.

On Friday Mr. P. L. Weiss, of the Modern
High School, Phillip-street, took the occasion of
midwinter "breaking-up” to give a large party,
when the whole of his establishment was illumed
with lanterns and gay with pot plants. Mr. Weiss
spoke a few words very briefly, and then attention
was turned to the programme of twenty-four
dances, which were done in duplicate, upstairs and
down. Of course, all the boys were present, and
in addition a large gathering ot their friends,
mostly in full dress. At supper Dr. Tarrant pro-
posed the health of the host, and Mr. Weiss, in
replying, concurred with the Dr. that book lore did
not complete education. Manners were occasionally
overlooked, but education should make boys
gentlemen as well as scholars, and even the light
engagement of dancing was an accomplishment
that could not be neglected by those who degired
to take a place with credit in modern society.

Needs’ Rooms have seldom looked so well
as they did on Wednesday last week, when the
Diamond ball was held. A fair number of invita-
tions had been issued, and those who had received
them were considerably envied, for it was known
the ball would be a very fashionable affair. Active
preparations were made to ensure its being bril-
liant in every respect, aid a great interest was felt
when the night of the 30th arrived. The ball was
given by the officers of H.M.S. Diamond, and they,
with the numerous other naval men and midship-
men, &c., present, were all in full uniform. The
porch, through which the guests entered, and
around which a crowd of the general public who
had not been invited gathered, was adorned with
colour and greenery and lanterns; and in the ball-
room some of the decorations, which included lots
of flowers and bunting, were specially designed
for the occasion, notably four large discs with
pink, groundwork, one on each wall; in two of
them, stars were formed by lines of bayonets and
ramrods radiating out, and in the others by
bright and glistening naked cutlasses—instru-
ments which the gallant tars are understood
to be constantly' yearning to use on the
dastard enemies of their country. Pending the
appearance of the dasta»l enemies, however, they
kill society belles, and do the slide waltz. Saiiors,
who, as yet, only adorn the Ralph Rackstraw rank
of the service, wore stationed all over the building
to do all needful little services. Kopff’s band rat-
tled olf the music, and the great Smith catered a
dainty spread on the supper tables. Low-necked
dresses were cn regie, trains prevailed, and light
tints were chiefly worn. Handsome costumes
were too numerous for detail, but two pure white
ones wore specially beautiful. One of the belles
of society wore a soft white spotted silk, the full
bodice and short sleeves trimmed with pearl em-
broidery. A waterfall and deml-train fell over the
back skirt, which was of Brussels net; on the front
was rich embroidery over puffings of net, with
draping of spotted silk. All was white, except
real gold lace round the edge of train. A darker
lady, also well known, from over the water, wore
a white dress; foundation of cream satin covered
with Breton not: oidelwels lace flounces on the
front, pullings caught up by real white ostrich
glumes, some of which also decked the bust. The
allroom began to thin between 3 and 3 o’clock,
and the carriages had nearly' all rolled away by the
latter hour,

A “Block” Scene; 4 p.m. Monday. Two
banker’s boys going down George-street. Two
little heartbreakers of the antagonistic sex coming
up George-street. First young lady bows stiffly to
first banker’s boy, and passes quickly on. Second
banker ( loq .): “ Bai Jove, Fwed, what a lucky dawg
you are with the girls! Who’s that new beauty ?”
Fwed: “ Oh, little girl I picked up one night at the
Glebe Rowing Ball. Used to part her round a bit
at first, but she got so awfully shook—used to
follow a fellah round everywhere ; awful boar,
y’ know—had to cut it.” What the first girl
said: “ There’s that conceited goose again 1 Don’t
look round for the world, Florrie, or the fool will
turn back, and we’ll never get rid of him. All he
can talk of is foot-ball and cricket, and the awfully
Jolly night he had at Needs’s ; and yet, when he
does go to a ball, all he can do is to keep up the walls
all night, and look ugly.”

The Osborne Memorial Church, Dapto,
was the scene of a pretty wedding on the 13th
June, when a promising young journalist led to
the altar one or Unanderra’s best girls, who looked
charming in white grenadine, satin bodice and
train; wreath and veil, of course. Ten maids
supported her. This being the first wedding in the
new church, the newly wedded couple, according
to custom, were the recipients of a handsome
Family Bible. After the ceremony, the company
sat down to an elaborate breakfast at the residence
of the bride’s parents, and the happy pair were
afterwards sent off with rice and slippers to Moss
Vale and Sydney. Best wishes to the bride, and a
little “Far” to start with.

The Misses Walker, of Bathurst-street, gave
a school breaking-up party to pupils, relatives aud
friends, on the 19th, at Nithsdale, when some seven
or eight score were present. Plain and fancy cos-
tumes wore worn; ClaUdine, Canada, Olivette, and
Mascotte were all good, and a North Shore Queen
was very noticeable. A Glebe young lady person-
ated Patience well, and a Richmond belle was an
enchanting Lydia Languish. Very handsome was
the cream satin, trimmed with blue and seed
pearls, worn by a William-street young lady, who
was Levy’d upon for every dance. Programme
exhausted between two and three o'clock, and
Mrs. Bentley’s music gave all the dancers great
satisfaction.
♦ * *
The June ball of the Woollahra Assembly
occurred at Nithsdale on Friday, when the attend-
ance was large enough to fill the rooms ; and, as
twenty-four dances were done by one o’clock,
there was considerable liveliness in the proceed-
ings. This is commendable: short dances, close
together, is the golden rule. A Bathurst belle, in
pale blue silk and tartan tabs, was a beautiful
dancer; so was an American young lady, in cream.
A young married lady was very charming in pale
pink satin; one of her assistants at the recent pretty
ceremony being delightfully tasteful in heliotrope
and pansies. Gold-sprinkled hai: gave a Forbos-
street fair one a rather rich appearance; and a
black dress graced a belle who is always fashion-
able. Two captains’ daughters from over the water
excelled in the rhythmic evolutions of the twink-
ling feet. Finish at one o’clock. A very select
coterie initiated a new freak of fashion by waltz-
ing all through the Lancers. It’s a rather favourite
style among sundry velvet-collared young gentle-
men whom the uneven hand of fate has placed at
the wrong end of society’s ladder.

The audience at Herr Alpen’s concert in
the Protestant Hall was packed as tight as sardines,
but was not quite so brilliant. Scores of motherly
faces beamed gladly when their Seliners and
Jemimers stood up in their No. 8 kid shoos to sing.
The Herr had done wonders with the voices, and
his own cantata is quite pretty, especially con-
sidering that it was, as we understand, composed
in Miss Moon, Miss St. Clair, and Mr.
Brewer, ot course did well, and Lieutenant Mul-
holland directed 100 girls through their calisthenics,
each one carrying a wreath of flowers with pretty
effect. Baby's singing was a feature, and another
feature was a silver flower stand presented to
Herr Alpen.

On Thursday last, a ball was given at
Orange Grove, Hurst ville, by Mr. Alfred Gannon,
on the completion of alterations to his mansion, and
every effort was made to render the affair a success.
Dancing commenced at 9, and was imiintaincd till
nearly dawn. The hostess was attired in a lovely
ruby silk, trimmed with orange blossoms and
looped with silver flowers. Mrs. Jos. Gannon wore
white satin with trimmings of pale blue and
cardinal, and was regarded as belle. Emeraldville
was represented by a lady in emerald silk. Attrac-
tive among the maids were two in lavender and
white, aud one in cardinal and black, with ruffling
of sea-green. And all went uway happy and
satisfied.

Precocious child: “ Are you very short of

The Marchioness of Normanby gave an
At-Home at Government House, Melbourne, in
honour of the visit of Lord and Lady Augustus
Loftus to the sister capital. Seats were set in a
semi-circular form in the large ballroom, and the
music commenced at half-past 9. Choruses, part
songs, aud solos by members ot the Leidertafel,
under Julius Herz, proved the staple part of the
concert. Among the items were Kendall’s singing
of “Image of the Rose,” with humming accom-
paniment, aud two German songs which served to
introduce Herr Hartung, a fine new baritone just
arrived from Leipsic. The Marchioness wore a
dinner dress ot black velvet, and white crape
shawl; Lady Loitus, a black satin broch«5 and lace
dress. Most of the other ladies favoured black.
As regards hair construction, about half the ladies
wore their tresses coiled or heaped on the top of
their heads; the others, seemingly out of pure de-
fiance, coiled them lower than ever on the nape of
the neck. Supper concluded the evening.

Our American cousins have every year
made the “ Glorious Fourth ” of July, the anniver-
sary of the day when they wrung independence
from our forefathers—and from some of their own
for the matter ot that, for immigration from Great
Britain to the United States has made Americans
of lots of recent Englishmen—a memory of plea-
sure Instead of a reminiscence of defeat. The
celebration of the American national holiday has
in Sydney no associations but such as are full of
delight, to the fair sex especially. The picnics and
balls on the Fourth have invariably been among
the pleasantest of annual social events, and the
forthcoming ball at Nithsdale is, if every sort of
trouble to ensure success be a guarantee, pretty
sure to be on a pur with those which have preceded
it. During the day, the Consul, Mr. Kahlo, will re-
ceive at his office such visitors as may desire to
testify their respect for the Government ho repre-
sents.

At Martells, in France, the sister of Mr.
J. E. Redmond, the eloquent M.P., was recently
married to Mr. .Louis Howard, only son of the late
Mr. George Howard, of N.S.W. More agitation....
Next mouth, Mr. and Mrs. M. Doyle, of Yamma, in
the Forbes district, will celebrate their golden
wedding by a largo party. As they have fifty
grandchildren alone, it couldn’t well be a small
party....Mr. Philip Snape, the P.M. at Gulgong,
has just completed a fine ball-room, so there’s
gaiety about....Susan Bowls, of Melbourne, aged
19, on her marriage day deliberately shot herself
just before the ceremony. Girls don’t often do
that. But husbands wish they did A pleasing
presentation was marie at Waverley recently. At
the close of the Council meeting, aldermen and
friends adjourned to a dejcxuier set by Compugnoni
in the hall, and after a few toasts Mr. Simpson, the
Mayor, handed over a watch, whose inscription
speaks for itself, thus: “To John Macpherson, Esq.,
J.P., 10 years Mayor of Waverley. From his
brother aldermen, May 1883.” Before leaving a
N.Z. town, Jennie Lee gave a dinner to all the
stage hands of her company. This is the sort
of act we like to see a star shine in
A social reunion takes place in the Petersham
Town Hall on the 38th June....The first scries of
Floral Assemblies held at Mrs. Wyatt’s, Darling-
hurst, having ended, a brief recess takes place, and

August —A bachelors’ ball happened at Glen
Innes on Friday week, when about forty couples
circled round to good music, and in the contest for
belle two ladies were very close; the charming
daughter of a local lay reader in black velvet, and
a young lady from thoTinfleldsin black grenadine
and lace—Sir Henry Parkes, it is understood,
leaves for Europe on the 13th Julv Mr. J. Fitz-
patrick, who recently died at Campbclltown, was
one of the Hume and Hovell party when they
crossed the Murray in 1834.... By the way, it is a
pity that owing to the lateness of the hour, and
general tediousness at the close of the Albury
banquet, the toast of the “ Ladies ” was not given,
as it was expected that both the gentlemen in
whoso hands the toast was placed, would, from
their varied and piquant experience of the
sex, have made most interesting speeches
Mr. Harrlo Wood, Under-Secretary for Mines, was
received in a most complimentary manner by the
mining people of the city of gold, old Ballarat.
Mr. Wood was an old resident of Ballarat Archi-
bald Forbes spent a day with Sir Henry Parkes on
Sunday, coming down the mountains to lecture at
Parramatta. He will leave in the same steamer on
the 13th July; Hugh Taylor, M.P., being also a
passenger—Mrs. Hampson, the revivalist, left
Melbourne for Adelaide on Monday. People used
tb wait at the doors of the Town Hall two hours
to hear her... A skating club is being formed at
Yass. All the girls with small feet are in raptures.
But they dissemble their joy, and say “Graciousl
whatever will these dreadful men propose next ?”
....A nice At-Home was given by Mr. and Mrs.
Archibald Colville, on Monday, at Kedfern.
Hostess in violet; Newtown sent a skilful skater,
and Brisbane a blonde in peacock brilliancy. A
nightingale came from Petersham, and a trio
from Elsiecralg, and the belle from Bourke-street.
— In Melbourne, the Normanby Bicycle Club was
to have a ball last night, first annual. Here’s a
hint—This really occurred at a country town.
“ Why don’t you get married, Mr. Brown ?" “ Oh,
I don’t know, Miss Jones,” he said, carelessly;
“ never thought much about it." “ Why don’t you
marry one of us?” He started. “Suppose you
try a flirt with Ada, and see how you like it,” the
siren continued. He nodded intelligently; he
wouldn’t mind. Ada was quietly telegraphed for;
they saw each other four times; now she is Mrs.
Brown, and the wedding spread was splendid A
fortnight ago, some ladies and gentlemen gave
their services in a dramatic performance for the
benefit of the Parramatta Rowing Club funds.
The club have recognised their kindness and
trouble in a graceful way, by tendering the per-
formers a complimentary evening party on next
Wednesday, 4th July, at the Masonic Hall, Parra-
matta A successful fancy bull was held at
Mudgee a few days since. Miss Ryan, from Sydney,
was noticeable among the fair ones; also Miss
Moran as Queen of Roses, Mrs. M’Laughlin as
Queen of Scots, and Miss A, Butler as Sunset.
Singing, plenty of dancing, and gay costumes
made it a good ball The N.S.W. Artillery Baud,
who went to Albury, were shabbily treated. They
were done out of the ball, and when returning had
hardly a shilling. At least a guinea apiece might
be voted them The vocal performers of the
Sydney Liedertafel go to-day (Thursday) to
Windsor, to give a concert in aid of the local hos-
pital. Mr. M’Quade pays all expenses, provides a
special carriage on the train, and makes the mem-
bers his guests throughout.

To prosecute a man for selling the “ Fruits
of Philosophy ’’—which book is bad enough, we
admit—and to ignore the fact that he has been sell-
ing Aristotle, Apuleius, Ovid, Catullus, Martial,
not to mention Moses, Jeremiah, Solomon, and
Ouida, for a score of years or more, is verily to
strain at the gnat and swallow the dromedary.
At the Liberal Association meeting, the
other day, the scalping knife was buried deep, and
peace was restored in the ranks. So the orthodox
enemy had better prepare tor squalls. No less
than six vice-presidents elected, and there were
about sixty nominations for the olliee. “ Why
don’t they make them all vice-presidents?” asked
a Liberal, something after the fashion which ob-
tained in A. Ward’s famous corps.
We stated the other day, that the Echo is
never humorous. We were wrong. The Echo
has shown that it can sometimes be exceedingly
tunny—by mistake. On Saturday last it published
a letter to the Bishop of Newcastle, from John E.
Kelly (Stockwhip Kelly), and won a broad grin
from every reader, by heading a letter of which
every sentence which wasn’t a challenge was a
warning: “ A Cry lor Help to the Bishop of New-
castle by a Sceptic.”
The other day, during the absence from
his home, Murtoa, of Mr. Goodyear, a Wesleyan
clergyman, who had to preach at Warracknabea.1,
his father, suddenly and without warning, expired.
A messenger was sent to apprise the rev. gentle-
man of the mournful tact, and he arrived at War-
racknabeal to And that the service had commenced,
and that the preacher was discoursing upon the
death of Lazarus, and laying groat stress upon the
manifestation of Christian fortitude under be-
reavements, especially by death I
N. O. Lane endeavours to go for Dr. Hughes,
but it’s a case of “ no thoroughfare.” Lane tries
to make a point by contrasting the lives of Pascal,
Fenelon. Kepler, Newton, Locke, Butler, Burke,
Bright, and Gladstone, with those of Voltaire,
Mirabeau, Tom Payne, Carlyle, Chesterfield, and
Bolingbroke. He quite fails to see that such an
a/rautnentum ad hominum cuts both ways, as ’twould
be as easy to say contrast the life of that profess-
ing Christian, the historic Bishop of Clogher, with
that of the aUeged-by-orthodoxy-to-be-infldel,
Spinoza!
The Bishop of Newcastle defends Jacob’s
character as against that of Esau on the ground
that it was a developmental soit of character—
tha>, though beginning with predilections for
swinlbng, it had gone in for respectability as soon
as there was no more need for hanky-panky. As
for Esau, he was a plain-dealing, plain-speaking
fellow right through, and in no need of episcopal
supervision. Of course, whilst there are bishops
and sich like to the fore, there must be Jacob : or
rather, put t’other way, ’tis these latter constitute
the raison d’etre for right reverends. Given no
Jacobs; wanted no bi-hops.
Thus an ancient Puritan, not without rea-
son, concerning the Anglican Litany:—“Now this
Letany is a very fascinating fardel of tautologies
and battologies, in which there is Lord deliver vs
eight times. Hear, we beseech Thee, twenty times,
to omit many desires to be delivered from things
of which there are not the least appearance, no more
than of the danger of being drunk at a Whiteson-ale,
or having a purse cut at a stage-play, and not so
much. Agaiue, after a tautologicall summing-up
and repetition of the titles and elogies of the
Trinity, tossed with reponses, they fail on in a
heathenish way to act the word Letany, or
Maggany. as it is well rendered—namely, as it were
to conjure; and, as it the Divell were now to be dis-
possess they would use the very same pieces—
namely, by the mysterie of Thy Holy Incarnation,
&c.”
The labourers of High Roding, a village in
Essex. England, do not taste butcher’s meat from
one year’s end to the other. Recently their vicar
discovered that quantities of beef, of which
beef-tea was made at the hospitals, was sold for
pigs’ food after the strength and nourishment were
extracted ; and thinking that the famished la-
bourers might be the better of it, he introduced it
into the village, with the result that, owing to the
low price, it was eagerly bought up by these poor
people. One poor fellow was heard to say Ah, if
I had food like this every day, it would soon make
a new man of me.*’ In the worst days of the bar-
barian Roman Empire, labourers, slaves, and helots,
however badly treated otherwise, were well and
liberally fed. It has been reserved for Christian
England in the 19th century to have a labouring
population worse off, in many respects, than any
slaves of ancient or modem times.
Regarding the blasphemy prosecution,
Truth says :—“ Foote and Ramsey ought to have
been tried for their offence against public decency.
But to rake up an old statute against blasphemy,
applicable alike to them and to Professor Huxley,
Mr. John Morley, and many other eminent men,
and, on conviction, to sentence theni to a years
imprisonment, was an aBuse of law. The conduct
ana remarks of Mr. Justice North, who tried them,
were a disgrace to the Judicial Bench, bo we
think i for though Foote’s publication was grossly
indecent and tasteless, the prosecution was not
based on that evident fact, but an old statute was
hunted up and the law strained just to make it
apply to one certain case, to suit the bigoted pre-
ludice of a Judge known to have strongly biassed
feelings on that case. Again, says Truth :
“ What is wanted in a Judge is not a mere know-
ledge of law, but that sort of all-round knowledge
which is not learnt by poring over law-books.
We are sure of this. Were it otherwise, the sight
could scareiy have been seen, of; a tossil on a j udi-
cial bench, in a state of the most benighted !gno-
rance of what went on around him, diligently
applying, in his legal decisions, the logic of the
rationalistic chicken : “ What I’ve not seen, 1 nevei
will believe in.”
It was regretfully mentioned at the last
meeting of the Ladies’ United Evangelistic Asso-
ciation that within a short distance ot the citv ot
Melbourne large numbers of ladies, as well as
gentlemen, assembled on the Subbath to play lawn-
tennis, croquet, &c.; that in another place the
sounds of a brass band were heard on that day, and
even a dancing pavilion, which was freely patron-
ised. Why should lawn-tennis, croquet, and danc-
ing be considered unfit pastimes tor the day of
recreation ? What does Professor Blackie say in
the wisest of his lay sermons: Music and sketch-
ing in the country, easy social gatherings among
friends, and healthy games such as croquet, lawn-
tennis, golf, boating, though scarcely permitted by
British usage, are contrary neither to the letter
nor to the spirit of the Mosaic command. As tor
the brass band, doesn’t the L.U.E. Association
know that the brass band is now a religious insti-
tution. At the enthronization of the Archbishop
of Canterbury “ some brass instruments in the
hands of surpliced musicians added greatly to the
musical effect.” To keep on the right side of the
L U.E.A., we would recommend brass bandsmen
to wear surplices on the Sabbath. A man in a sur-
plice working a trombone would produce a de-
cidedly novel, it not a distinctly religious, effect.
Bishop Pearson’s Letter for Sunday,
printed in the Echo ot Saturday week, is
by no means unpleasant reading, but from one
end to the other it is a petitw prmcipU. Jbrom his
stand (or sit) point, his ex cathedra ' argument is
right enough. If prelacy and ritualism (more or
less ornate), and Anglican service, and phrases
attuned to venerable dogmas, and sweet goocly-
goodyisms about heaven, and terrible descnptioas
of the penalties that await the reprobated these
things are religious essentials, then the J LB and the
B2 of his epistle are very good Bs, and the work
they are doing is the proper sort of h ,, on ®£"“^ 1 P£;
But how if these things are not so? How it the
observances they preach be little better than
national fetishes? Of couree, it sounds terrible to
episcopal ears to think that, on the Sabbath Days
a Freethinker should be permitted to d* 8 ®** 8 ®
“Sutherland and Sulphur” united, in a taking 1
alliteration. But have their Right Kfverendnesses
ever thought how terribly some ot their viows
sound in the ears ot thousands of Freethinkers ?
It liberty be accorded to to preach
Sulphur, and Dr. Pearson to preach, Unless a
man believe this, without doubt he shall perish
everlastingly 7 ,” why, in a free country, should you
or I be precluded from endeavouring to test the
quality of the sulphur and the specific gravity of
the damnation ?
Although for many years precedent to his
decease, Bishop Colenso had relinquished the field
of disputation, his quietude had been the repose of
a conqueror. The late Bishop leaves a reputation
unapproaohed by that of any theologian of his
generation. Future generations will recognise in
him a reformer as great as Luther. The doctrine
of the literal interpretation and plenary inspiration
of the Bible had been often challenged before
Colenso. bishop of an obscure dependency, levelled
his critical lance at it. But the dogma had sur-
vived all shocks up to that time; and when the late
Bishop’s great work appeared, it was as distinctly
a blasphemy to doubt the scientific accuracy of the
Mosaic records, as it is to-day to question the
literal divinity of Christ. No one who had arrived
at years of discretion when “Colenso on the
Pentateuch” was first published, can forget the
tremendous turmoil that w« rk occasioned. The
whole orthodox world rose in arms again-tit. The
press groaned in a constant delivery of rejoinders,
criticisms, contradictions and denunciations.
Every ambitious cleric recognised that his way to
a living or a bishopric was made easy. He had
only to publish a crushing rejoinder to Colenso.
Established authority stretched tortb its powerful
hand to crush the Horesiarch. Ur. Colenso was
solemnly deprived of his see and his episcopal
authority. An orthodox zealot, Dr. Grey, was
appointed bishop in ids stead, and actually invaded
his See, and set himself up against the Bishop, who
had dared to think. And now—“Colenso on the
Pentateuch,” holds its place in every standard
collection of theological wor ks, while the thousand
a< d one rejoinders, crushing replies, and so forth,
are rotting in the limbo of dead publications, and
no man can recall the name of one of their authors.
Recognizing its failure to crush Colenso, ortho-
doxy sank into silence, and absorbed his system.
The orthodoxy of to-day is a Colenso orthodoxy.
Every essential point ot his contentions has been
conceded. And there is a tacit consent even to his
most sweeping deductions. The school to which
belong the Bishops of Melbourne and of Newcastle
—a very extensive school in the old country—are
the creatures of Colonso’s teaching, a shame-faced
lot of deciples, who lack courage to acknowledge
the master from whom the dictmctive features of
their theology are derived. It is no use cocks
crowing in their hearing. They have not the grace
to weep bitterly. They merely shed copious floods
of explanations and qualifications. But none the
less, the Protestant Christianity of to-day is
Colenso protestantism, and a theology vastly dif-
ferent from that which preceded the rational re-
formation wrought by his powerful arraignments
of the fanatical and corrupt clinging to a gross
supernatural ism and unreason.
Christ was a socialist who bewailed the
wretchedness of the poor and the callousness of
the rich. Democracy must insist on Christ being
on its side, and the sects will tumble-or, rather,
there being vested interests they will not fall, but
will become democratic sooner than give up the
loaves and fishes. Here are some original verses
by Mr. W. Apsey, of Cobargo:—

stition, without having lost its external power, it

“COMFORT YE MY PEOPLE.”
’Tis He who speaks, who held the tides
O’er armies by the sea;
Whose hands swept back the waters till
All He had loved went free:
Whose face looked through the pillar then,
With temples swoll’n with wrath,
Which struck upon the flying sea
That sweating plunged afroth;
While earth stood still in gaping awe
At anger of the God,
Who hurled His maddened waters where
The oppressor late had trod.
’Tis He who speaks, who raised the hills,
And graved his nam on rock,
With lightnings from His bended bow,
By Sinai’s quaki ’g block;
Who swept the mount with fiery glance,
And made His presence felt
In thunders that shook down the hills
Whereon the kneclers knelt:
Who dared not rise, but bent them down
And clasped the breathing ground
That move and heaved beneath His look,
And shrunk where He had frowned.
But comfort ye Hi people, and
Stern Anger’s direst flush
Shall be to thee protection, though
His arm be > aised to crush;
And wrath that rends the world apart,
While totters every hill.
To thee shall bo that Shioldqr’s voice
That breathed the “ Peace! be still 1
Ah! comfort ye His people, all
The helpless, old, and poor;
His wronged and His defenceless ones
Awrcck on every shore—
Whore sunbeams rarely linger, and
Where breaks the crested foam
Remorseless on the bosoms that
Not yet have found a home.
It burst in shattered fragments from
A tender gallant heart,
What time they stripped and nailed Him up,
And pierced with jeer and dart;
Had I been there -why, with these hands.
I’d ” Common braggart—peace!
Not such as thou dare rise to deeds,
Or seas of tears might cease.
It roll’d in tides down Calvary,
Through sand and soil and cleft,
Nor yet has reached His weary ones
That legacy Ho left:
The comfort for his people with
All human mercy rife,
And meant for wealth of sunshine o’er
Eacli desolated life.
