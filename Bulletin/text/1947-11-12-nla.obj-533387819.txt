PROFUSE CARVINGS ENDOW ROSSLYN’S CHAPEL WITH RARE BEAUTY
SOME few miles south of Edinburgh is the Midlothian village
of Rosslyn, whose chapel has won great renown for the
richness of its carving. Built in 1446, by the third Earl of Orkney,
to be the choir of a collegiate church (which was never com-
pleted), this chapel possesses stone carvings of remarkable intri-
cacy. Its pillars, architraves, window tracery and vaulted roof
portray a bewildering assortment of subjects, outstanding among
jyhich are the Seven Acts of Mercy, the Seven Deadly Sins, and
the Dance of Death. One of the most attractive relics seen here
is the famous prentice pillar, which owes its name to the story that
its carving was executed by ■an apprentice during is mas er ®
absence. Beneath the chapel is a crypt, evidently of earlier date
than the church itself, which legend says was once the residence
of a priest. Rosslyn gives) the title of earl to the , • ’
Clair-Erskine and has also historical associations with the Smcla
family, on whose lands' Rosslyn Castle was built.

"ESSAY ON RIME."
As one of the worst poems ever written
—by a reputable and promising author,
that is—Karl Shapiro’s Essay on Rime
(Seeker and Warburg) is singularly and
disarmingly attractive. Shapiro, to be
just to Alfred Austin, has not that poet’s
mastery of bathos:
Across the wires the electric message came,
“He is no better; he is much the same” —
but still, if he makes the name he seems
likely to, there are lines in Essay on Rime
that will shine brightly enough in the
treasury of poets’ lapses. For instance:
The premise that our verse
Is in decline has not, I am convinced,
Been honestly attacked or well defended.
And again:
But can the science of definition relate to
Poetry, even obliquely?
And yet again:
I trust
I have not bit off more than I can chew.
And once more:
The macron, or long mark,
And breve, or short, used in accentuation
Are suitable for count of eye. The Rape of
The Lock conforms exactly to this scheme
But, for example, The Forsaken Merman
Does not.
And further:
Before touching on these let us examine
If possible, the ecology of their form.
And lastly;
I wish to make acknowledgment to Doctor
David Lovett of Baltimore.
Well, Wordsworth once began a sonnet
with a resounding cry of “Jones! ”;
Shapiro, a young American who was in
Australia during the war with the U.S,
forces and whose V-Letter won the
Pulitzer Prize for poetry, errs in dis-
tinguished company.
It would be unfair to ask from Essay
on Rime poetry of the highest, visionary
kind. Flashes here and there;
What witch pinched Robert Browning, and
what grief
Beat at the golden doors of Hopkins’
heart?
are well enough in a somewhat facile
way, but the work is essentially an essay,
not seeking to climb the heights. What is
required is eloquence: the clarity and
precision of good verse, as distinct from
poetry.
Eloquence of a kind there is, as in
Shapiro’s satirical description of the
typical modem poem—typical, one should
add, to the verse of the fashionable
schools and the little magazines:
Reconstructing night,
The poet with painted and lack-lustre eye
Stares in the glass at pallid dawn and sees
The image of his sufficiency, a face
Wretched in weakness and a vibrant claw
Trailing a pen. From such ennui the poem
Takes its first line, digresses for a space,
Slips sidewise on a metaphor, proceeds
In doubt of its intention towards a pitch
Of mild mental excitement, strings its beads
Of meaning on the mended thread of rhythm,
Comments its way to a conclusion which
Is nothing but the vestigial proof of nothing;
Or else in senseless vi.olence on itself
Ends in a brawl of vocatives and a roar
Of “ancestral voices prophesying war.”
But if you compare this passage—
one of the poem’s best —with the satire
of Pope or Roy Campbell, its deficiencies
outweigh its merits. Shapiro has, in
effect, attempted to write heroic couplets
without going to the trouble of rhyming
them.
As an experiment this may have a kind
of negative value, as proving that it can’t
be done; but the absence of the snap of
rhyme and the sparkle of wit can hardly
be admitted as an achievement or a dis-
covery in technique. Lacking a personal
style—he writes in the fashionable “clini-
cal” manner of contemporary intellec-
tuals —Shapiro has climbed half-way, as
it were, back to the academic style. If
he had gone the whole journey, he would
still have had to learn that even -the
academic style, the strict heroic couplet,
can and must be moulded into a personal
mode of expression. His poem can, of •
course, be regarded simply as blank verse
rather than as unrhymed heroic couplets;
in which case it remains very blank.
The faults of Essay on Rime, whether
of inadequacy or doggerel, spring from
one astounding misconception: a failure
to distinguish between literary and spoken
language. Shapiro writes:
The metric of this book is made upon
The classic English decasyllabic
Adapted to the cadence of prose speech.
He has sought, that is to say, to write the
kind of speech rhythm employed, to take
an Australian example, by Judith Wright:
South of my days’ circle, part of my blood’s
country,
rises that tableland, high delicate outline
of bony slopes wincing under the winter
a measure scanned, as he says of Hop-
kins’s verse, by the ear and not by the
eye : but obviously, when the quotations
are compared, Shapiro has hardly, except
in an occasional wobble, brought speech
rhythms at all into his verse. He is using
a purely literary language, that of a prose
essay, and he cannot possibly submit it
as a natural speech rhythm in his poetry:
because it is not, in the first place, natural
speech. People do indeed talk in a
kind of natural poetry, the way Judith
Wright makes her drover speak in “South
of My Days”:
Droving that year, Charleville to the Hunter,
nineteen-one it was, and the drought begin-
ning;
sixty head left at the Mclntyre, the mud
round them
hardened like iron; and the yellow boy died
in the sulky ahead with the gear—
but Shapiro, even if he is not a drover,
is hard)y likely to talk like this:
On the other hand, consider the results
Of Auden’s reintroduction of abstraction
Into our rhetoric. From the particular,
The substantive and the difficult commonplace
He moved upon the general and from thence
To an almost Spenserian and occult
Prosopopoeia.
In an essay almost wholly concerned
with the distinction between natural and
mechanical rhythm— measurement by the
ear or by the eye—this is indeed an
astonishing confusion. Shapiro seems to
know everything about the subject ex-
cept the fundamental difference between
the way men write and the way they
speak.
Still, it is not every man who can use
the word “prosopopoeia” in a poem; not
every man, indeed, who knows what it
means. Though, technically. Essay on
Rime is at best an amiable jogtrot, it is
essentially a poem of ideas; and these
—Shapiro’s thoughts on prosody and his
criticisms of both new and established
writers—are very interesting indeed. It
is difficult to agree with him that James
Joyce’s Ulysses is essentially a work of
poetry—Joyce himself, after all, sub-
mitted it as a novel —but that is hardly
a subject for an Australian to debate. We
have banned Ulysses.
On other points it is easier to agree.
There is an analysis of Milton’s versifica-
tion ; a rather brief and timorous ap-
proach to Browning ; comments on Hop-
kins, Bridges and Eliot and a particularly
illuminating study of the influence for
good and bad of Auden’s verse. If one
is unable to share the author’s natural
reverence for Walt Whitman (who led
American verse away from poetry and up
the gum-tree of oratory) it is at least
interesting to read his point of view ; as
also in the case of Hart Crane. An attack
on the Freudian and Leftist tendencies in
modern verse shows that Shapiro recog-
nises clearly the principal menaces to
contemporary poetry. The essay is, in-
deed, so useful as a textbook on how to
write an acceptable modern poetry in
natural speech rhythm that it’s a pity
Shapiro wasn’t able to read it before he
wrote it.
Richard Le Gallienne.
Of Richard Le Gallienne, dead at 81,
Osbert Burdett wrote: “To the writers
of the ’nineties he was what Rupert
Brooke became afterwards to the
Georgians, but, unlike Brooke, he failed
to achieve the poetic act of dying
young.”
In spite of their candle-at-both-ends
existence, many of the ’ninety men have
lasted the distance well. They were not
all Francis Thompsons, Ernest Dowsons
or Lionel Johnsons, bound so soon for
Tymanoge. Frank Harris, toughest of
them all, lived so long that one Bulletin
• scribe who met him a few years before
the end saw such wonderful vitality in
the old rascal as to question the inevi-
tability of death.
Ernest Rhys, who was the second sur-
viving member of the Rhymers’ Club,
was an octogenarian; “Max Beerbohm is
now over 75, and Shaw well ahead of
the psalmist’s limit. All these were
’ninety men, but none so much as the
gentle Richard, whose locks were so all
embracing that Max drew a caricature
of him with two hats on his head. In
spite of his bizarre appearance Le
Gallienne was a strikingly handsome
figure, with a head, so Rothenstein ob-
served, like Botticelli’s Lorenzo, When
one comes to line them up—Wilde,
Beardsley, Yeats, Arthur Symonds,
Hubert Crackanthorpe, Stephen Phillips,
Henry Harland, George Moore —Le Gal-
lienne emerges as the epitomisation of
the exotic period of the long ago. When
they write of fin de siecle, the bizarre
and the patchouli of the “Yellow Book”
age, they are all thinking of so many
outlandishly-attired Richard Le Gal-
liennes.
So much for personality. How about
pen-power? Le Gallienne has been so
persistently debunked that I am begin-
ning to believe that there may be left
just a nosegay of immortality. He has
been called a “pseudo-sentimentalist of
weak-kneed prose” and described as
“irrevocably vulgar.” Yet the immortal
Max, while mocking him with his draw-
ing pencil, paid tribute to his prose. Max
forgot his dialectical astringencies when
he fell in love with Richard’s Golden Girl,
which book still remains one of my
favorite romances.
Among booklovers Le Gallienne must
be fondly remembered for his love of
fine printing and binding, a tenderness
equal to that of Austin Dobson. His de-
fence of limited editions, privately
printed for himself, Elkin Matthews and
John Lane in 1893, is a classic of its
kind and includes a rare little sonnet
“Confessio Amantis”:
When do I love you most, sweet books of mine?
In strenuous morns when o’er your leaves 1 pore,
Austerely bent to win austerest lore,
Forgetting how the dewy meadows shine;
Or afternoons when honeysuckles twine
About the seat, and to some dreamy
Of old romance, where lovers evermore
Keep blissful hours, I follow at your sign?
Yea! Ye are precious then, but most to me
Ere lamplight dawneth, when low croons the fire
To whispering twilight in my little room;
And eyes read not, but, sitting silently,
I feel your great hearts throbbing deep in quire,
And hear your breathing round me in the gloom.
Much of Le Gallienne’s prose and
poetry is dated. Yet a time may come
when the Golden Girl will trip forth
once more, when the Book Bills of Nar-
cissus may again see their reflection in
the waters of time, or when moralists
may declaim his “Omar Repentant,” the
only red-blooded thing he ever wrote.
PAT LAWLOR.
The Road to Canberra.
The road to Canberra is, of course,
paved with good intentions; among
which may be placed Warren Denning’s
The Road to Canberra (Australasian
Publishing Co.). A journalist who has
also written Inside Parliament, Mr. Den-
ning rode a bicycle from Sydney to Can-
berra.
If his book, on the whole, gives the
impression that the author —instead of
subjecting himself to this ordeal by wheel
—might just as well have ridden round
aftd round inside the Mitchell Library
that is not altogether a fault. It would
be difficult to make a wildly exciting
narrative of a bicycle trip. Bicycles do
not, like horses, buck; nor, like camels,
bite. Mr. Denning does not beg his food
and sleep under the stars like a swaggie;
he does not go on sprees and get chased
by snakes; he fails to do a perish in the
manner suitable to explorers. One punc-
ture and several walks up steep hills are
about the only sufferings he can submit
for the reader’s vicarious enjoyment.
Perhaps, to bring the book into the
class of H. V. Morton’s In Search of
Scotland, he should have taken longer
over the journey; met more people by
the way, dipped more deeply into local
history, found ghosts less celebrated than
Fisher’s. He seems to have whizzed to
Canberra with remarkable speed; and a
longer pause at Berrima Jail, for ex-
ample, would have added details of the
Great War internees to his historical
anecdotes.
Still, he stopped at Berrima long
enough—or afterwards read enough
about Berrima —to dig out, among other
historical information, the story of how
the prisoners of the early days once de-
cided to swear at the tops of their voices
for three days. Whether or not it is true
that this non-stop massed roaring
“shocked” the townspeople, as Mr. Den-
ning’s authority records, it must have
been a remarkable relief to the spirits of
the prisoners.
The merit of the book is that Mr.
Denning is genuinely fascinated by Aus-
tralian history and that he finds enough
of it along*the road to Canberra to make
that journey much more interesting than
before to anyone who, after reading him,
undertakes it. The narrative provides a
pretty effective answer to those who, in
ignorance or prejudice, have asserted
that Australia has “no history.”
On the contrary, it appears that at very
close intervals all along this road people
have obligingly got themselves hanged,
stuck up by bushrangers or foully done
to death for the pleasure of subsequent
tourists. Lennox built the Lansdowne
Bridge; Fisher’s Ghost courteously sat
on its rail ; cattle ran wild in the Cow-
pastures ; Macarthur imported his sheep ;
Cobb and Co. ran their coaches among
“floods, fires, bushrangers, blacks, acci-
dents, maniacs and murderers” ; Ben Hall
bailed up the township of Collector;
Dunn shot Constable Nelson, and Mr.
Denning saw the boots in which Dunn
was hanged, piously preserved; Lake
George, where the mirage glitters, altern-
ately fed sheep and Murray cod; Can-
berra was built; Billy Hughes cam-
.paigned for the improvement of the
Goulburn-Canberra road; and so on.
All this, of course, is admirably in-
formative. Tendencies to point the
moral, political and national, and to see
people as “tokens” of this or that instead
of simply as people add a burden to Mr.
Denning’s bicycle, but this, is offset to
some extent by pleasant and liberating
glimpses of the countryside. If the book
runs to a second edition it should be
illustrated.
Reviewed Briefly .
Of Death But Once (F. W. Cheshire,
Ltd.). The author, Roy Bulcock, an Air
Force man, was a prisoner-of-war in
Japanese hands, and the book chiefly
concerns his experiences, with some ac-
count of events in Malaya and Java, be-
fore capture. There is good, factual
meat in the book, although it is—in the
earlier part of the book—somewhat hard
to draw general conclusions, owing to
the author’s disconcerting habit of putting
down the truth as he sees it: thus, unless
one sifts carefully, there is a bewildering
tangle of heroism, cowardice, treachery,
foolishness and warlike wisdom—by all
concerned. This, from the point of view
of history—or the raw materials of his-
tory—is useful. But the selective method
bf fiction might have put the same facts,
in essence, in a more assimilable form.
Of the latter part of the book, that deal-
ing with p,-0.-w. experiences, there can
be no such confusion. And these, in the
total effect, startlingly contradict the con-
clusion of Vance Palmer, who, enthusing
in a foreword over the isolated humanity
of a Korean guard, generously states:
Such episodes remind us that the conflict
was not one of race or color.
George Washington Carver (Phoenix
House), by Rackham Holt; a well-
written biography of the famous Negro
agricultural chemist and humanitarian
in which the primary interests are agri-
cultural and scientific; but the man him-
self is clearly presented, and the back-
ground of racial clashes and conciliations
is, of course, of sociological interest.
Concerning this, it is interesting to note
that Carver, although technically the son
of a slave, led the reverse of a servile
childhood.
Yes, Your Honour! (Angus and
Robertson), by C. K. Thompson, a Syd-
ney journalist, who has drawn from his
court-reporting experiences a kind of
digest of legal information (from trials)
and judicial wisecracks. There is a fore-
word by Mr. Justice S. C. Taylor.
The Double Image (Seeker and War-
burg), by Rayner Heppenstall: a book of
limited appeal, dealing critically with four
French Catholic writers (Claudel, Bloy,
Bernanos, Mauriac), in which the author
argues ably but a little too subtly that
the work of these writers indicates, if it
does not precisely prove, that their crea-
tive powers are independent of their re-
ligious beliefs. And that, in consequence,
they tend towards private heresies. What
is interesting is the incidental criticism of
their work.
Suzanne and I (F. W. Cheshire, Ltd.),
by Alan D. Mickle; the war years as
viewed from a flat in the Melbourne
suburb of St. Kilda, with whimsical
darlings into the past, literature, history
and philosophy; making, in all, 185
pages of occasional writing in pleasant
but rather dull prose.
Country Heart (Harrap, Australasian
Publishing Co,), by Isabel Dick: a
pleasantly sentimental tale of Tasmania
and South Africa immediately after the
Boer War, and of lovers and lovers’ meet-
ings.
Journey Through Tomorrow (F. W.
Cheshire, Ltd.), by George H. Johnston.
A travel book taking in India, China,
Tibet, Burma and Japan, The author,
an Austfalian, has nothing essentially
new to say of India, China, etc., but the
portion dealing with Tibet is interesting.
Although various writers have written
about Tibet there is still something re-
mote and mysterious about that country
which appeals to the imagination. And
the author’s pleasantly cynical attitude to
the lamas of Konka Gomba—which he
considers to be the original Shangri-la
of fiction—makes vivid and interesting
reading.

How was the Australian Capital Territory
transferred to the Commonwealth ?
On Oct. 16, 1909, the Commonwealth and
the State of N.S.W. entered into an agreement
for the surrender to and acceptance by the
Commonwealth of an area of 911 square miles
as the seat of Government of the Common-
wealth. In Dec., 1909, Acts were passed by
the Commonwealth and N.S.W. Parliaments
approving the agreement, and on Dec. 5, 1910,
a proclamation was issued vesting the territory
to the Commonwealth to and from Jan. 1, 1911.
By the Jervis Bay Territory Acceptance Act,
1915, an area of 28 square miles at Jervis Bay,
surrendered by N.S.W. according to an agree-
ment made in 1913, was accepted by the Com-
monwealth, and was transferred as from Sept.
4, 1915.

Who were the Janissaries?
A body of Turkish infantry, first organised
in the 14th century and constituting the Sultan’s
guard. It was recruited mainly from the chil-

force became powerful and turbulent, and after
a revolt deliberately provoked by the Sultan
Mahmud II in 1826, many thousands of Janis-
saries were massacred and the organisation
abolished.

have been dying out, and efforts to grow young

unsuccessful. Can you advise on means of (1)
prevention and for (2) growing new trees?
(1) It is not possible to advise why the exist-
ing trees are dying out, without an inspection
by a competent person, although it is probable
that the series of dry seasons extending from
1939 to 1944 seriously affected them. (2)
Fresh kurrajong seed should be sown in pre-
pared seed-beds by broadcasting at the rate
of about 12 seeds per sq. ft., apd the seed
then covered to a depth of with a good,
sandy loam. An appreciable portion of the
seed will germinate in the first year, although
there will be delayed germination, and the bal-
ance of the viable seeds will not appear until
the second year following. In your area it is
probable that seed should be sown by late
August or early September. The seedlings
should be ready to transplant two years after
appearance, but it is advisable to cut back the
tops to a length of not more than Bin., and
to prune the roots to a similar length.

A COIN of the
REALM
By
CECIL
MANN
Anyone drop-
ping in at the
Teamsters’
Arms Hotel,
up at The Bend, will
be able to see for
himself the large
silver coin leaning
against a bottle on
the middle shelf;
like a medal awarded
to the house, the
traveller might think,
for being so con-
veniently there to
steady his nerves
with a snifter after
coming down round
the corkscrew twists
of the mountains
road or to brace him
with one or two be-
fore starting up.
Actually, though
it has a private little
history of its own.
the big coin could well be there merely
as a souvenir or curio of a currency
which, apart from an old man ’roo on
the pennies, an old man ram on the
shillings, some ears of wheat on the
threepences and a building reputed to
be a museum or an asylum on a special
florin, has been thought to lean somewhat
to the side of dullness.
This other big coin at least marks a
time when there must have been plenty
of silver at the mint. Its kind will still
be remembered: heavy, cumbersome
things, suitable for paperweights, valued
at five shillings and commonly called cart-
wheels ; with, on the one side, a hand-
some engraved profile of the present King,
and on the other a crown of about the
same shape and almost the same size as
the dome of St. Paul’s.
They will be remembered as having had
only a brief circulation, being, for various
reasons, among the least popular coins
ever minted. For one thing, they were
far too big and heavy to carry comfort-
ably about; and everybody, fearing to be
done in for so much by one stroke of
counterfeiting, was suspicious of them.
Eventually they became token coins
used, for tote-betting at the races, which,
the cynical said, is all they were coined
for in the first place; in which case they
deserved oblivion for the sacrilege by
omission in not having the great god
Phar Lap wearing the crown. He could
have won even with that handicap.
Anyway, for the same reasons —especi-
ally the one of weight—they had a short
life even in that last role, and are now
no more, save for odd specimens like the
one on the middle of the three shelves in
the bar of the Teamsters’ Arms.
The true history of this one had nothing
to do with gambling. Like its one-time
owner, when he arrived at The Bend, it
was mint-pure of that sort of contamina-
tion, though it must be said that in the
accounts given by old Tom Delaney,
proprietor of the Teamsters’ Arms, neither
of them, itself or its former owner, would
pass in a synod as entirely lilywhite or
spotless.
OLD Tom’s accounts, heard at different
times, form a striking example of how
entirely different representations may be
based on the one set of facts. Having
been the Teamsters’ Arms practically all
his life, so that now it is locally known
only as Old Tom’s, Tom Delaney in-
herited that roadside institution away up
near the source of the River when his
fine old father before him —pickled ; God
rest his soul —was carried over the bridge.
.Now old Tom himself is the grand old
man of The Bend (the place so called be-
cause the road, of all things for a road
to do, bends there), and what with hav-
ing been absorbing for so long the un-
troubled atmosphere of the locality, and
as unconsciously soaking in also the daily
libations of his own wares due to his
position, he would probably be always,
as he mostly is, the most jovial of good
fellows if it were not for his confounded
rheumatics.
When those are troubling him, old
Tom, as they don’t hesitate to say, is
about as sour an old cow as anyone could
want to meet. Thus there are two old
Toms; jovial there behind the bar in his
shirt-sleeves when his good rum is in ;
sour when his bad rheumatics overpower
even it. And hence come about his two
accounts of the coin of the realm on his
shelf and its former owner.
Sour or jovial, he is never reluctant to
take the big coin down, throwing it
heavily on to the counter or setting it
merrily spinning according to mood.
In either case what he has to tell about
it runs on the theme of deceptive ap-
pearances, but whereas, when the rheu-
matics are in, the effect is that of a
sermon on pretty low-down depravity,
when old Tom is his cheerful
self the effect is in all particulars the
very opposite; a jolly tale of love in the
straw.
NOT to dwell on a subject which, in
both versions, has a highly Rabe-
laisian content—and is, anyway, mislead-
ing—old Tom’s facts are that the person
in question, the one-time owner of the
five-bob piece, was a young schoolteacher
who came to The Bend straight from the
City. • There is a clear picture of him,
because, says old Tom, “He was the dead
ring of ’is Tghness the King, drored there
on the side.”
As anyone must
feel from eithei of
old Tom’s accounts:
Alas that anyone so
high in looks could
sink so low in acts!
For the young
schoolteacher, whose
name was Pritt —
Keith Pritt; not to
be confused with
any other school-
teacher of the same
name not only
vanished one night
and left a maiden
heart lamenting but
did so for a very
good, or rather a
very bad, reason ; in
fact about as bad a
reason as anyone
could well imagine.
Certainly as bad a
reason as Keith Pritt
could have fallen into.
Another woman, of course, and black
at that. Nor so young and charming,
either. Cook at the Teamsters’ Arms;
hight Bianna. The stables feedhouse, too,
of all places! Among the straw!
Such goings on at The Bend!
But alas that all this should be only
too true; that young and handsome
schoolteacher Keith Pritt should have
come to teach there, should have wooed
the one beauty of The Bend, Miss Daisy
Moriarty, should have been successful to
the point of engagement, and then should
have fallen, and fled! Leaving behind
him, too, to bear perpetual witness both
to his fall and to his handsomeness, the
only specimen of the heavyweight cham-
pion of the currency The Bend had seen
up to then.
A damning identification for more
reasons than one. Keith, as he was very
soon popularly called, had been so taken
with the novelty of the big coin he had
brought with him that in talking, or even
while giving lessons, he would be tossing
it up and down in his hand. Naturally,
too, he was flattered when Daisy, as he
was very soon calling her, discovered the
resemblance in the profiles, Keith’s and
the King’s. Nor did Daisy, loving him
as she did, fail to show off that resem-
blance in company, calling the coin forth
from where Keith now wore it, in his
vest-pocket over his heart.
Hence, very shortly, the saying round
The Bend, “Y’d pass f’r his double!”
which no one so young, and moreover
so upright and fine-minded, as Keith
Pritt could help finding most agreeable
flattery. v
Of course, afterwards, the fact that he
had come to The Bend from the City was
held accountable for his astounding lapse,
though most unjustly.
When Keith Pritt, having studiously
acquired the knowledge, went from the
City to The Bend he was as much what

NEW
DUNLOP TYRE
0” THE GREATEST
EVER BUILT!
As a result of research and
development over the past
10 years, Dunlop recently
began distribution of a NEW-
DESIGN, NATURAL RUB-
BER passenger car tyre . . .
the FIRST new post-war
tyre introduced by any
manufacturer in Australia !
The new “Super 90” is with-
out question the GREATEST
DUNLOP TYRE EVER
BUILT. The results of fac-
tory and road tests to date
have exceeded all expecta-
tions for long mileage and
all-round performance.
The long life of the new
“SUPER 90” is due chiefly
to three NEW and basic
design features : High-Pro-
file Casing, Tread Rubber in
Compression and a New De-
sign Tread. The result is a
car tyre that will give longer
useful life and greater mileage
than any previous tyre at
NO EXTRA COST ! ‘
Only limited supplies are
available at the moment, but
more and mere of these
wonderful new tyres are being
distributed to Dunlop dealers
throughout Australia . . . .
soon, these money-saving
DUNLOP SUPER 90’s will
be readily available to every
motorist.

he looked as if he had progressed the
other way about. Impervious, because
his heart was pure, to all those lures and
pitfalls inseparately perhaps a little
imaginatively; even perhaps a little
enviously associated with the City
at The Bend, he was young Galahad
out of his time; gentle-mannered,
virtuous; in all ways a thorough gentle-
man.
It would have been impossible to have
found one more suitable for instructing
the score of pupils The Bend mustered,
or, for that matter, to lead a troop of
boy scouts.
Afterwards, Mrs. King—as, by some-
thing like a matrimonial pun, she now is
—that is, Daisy Moriarty that was, did re-
call to herself that her old flame (so
she now thinks of him) was more im-
petuous than he looked at times, but
happily her looking-glass can still give
some reason for that. And no doubt it is
consolation to have been wooed by one
as handsome as a King.
The identifying of him with the coin
old Tom Delaney keeps there on the
shelf as a memento was further fixed
through the sporting talent which, com-
bined with his scholastic accomplishment,
must have given Keith a narrow escape
from being a Rhodes Scholar. Keith’s
game was the kingly one of cricket.
Despite that surely fitting description,
cricket had something to do with his fall.
Not onlv did Mr. Pritt raise the money
to get cricket gear for the school, and
join in the games there —out of sheer
enthusiasm and simple fairness playing
for both sides —but, as well, he organised
The Bend Cricket Club, drawing his Brad-
mans from many miles up the mountains
road and as far as the next township
down-river.
On the cricket field —at school and in
the District Competition —he fatally
identified himself further with his huge
piece of currency by using it, like Don’s
reputed four-shilling piece, as a lucky
coin, with sufficient success to make the
suspicious believe there were two Keith
Pritts on it instead of one His Majesty the
King.
The Bend XI all through shared its
captain’s faith in the big coin, never more
than in the course of defeating the Town
in what all the forty or so spectators
agreed was the most thrilling game ever
played at The Bend. As the saying goes,
little did they dream that the end of glory
was so near.
A THRILLING game ' it was, without
/a an y question. All in the one after-
noon, two innings by each side, and every-
body out for a grand total of less than
a century. Keith, as was expected of
him, won the toss with the lucky ’ coin,
It did not seem so lucky when the side
was all out, with its captain’s 15 the top
score and the total 31, but if that was a
disaster the Town’s performance was a
rout; thanks, mainly, to Keith Pritt’s
deadly slows, and, as the Town averred,
the blasted wicket.
The Town, used to its own excellent
Showground, had some cause for com-
plaint, The Bend Oval being an oblong
paddock lately frequented by cows, and
bumpy withal One of the bumps was
directly responsible for the first casualty,
the Town’s best bowler going down with
cupped hands to stop a stinging drive
back along the pitch, and the ball darting
up from a bump a foot in front of his
hands, to catch him fair on the bridge
of the nose and give him two of as lovely
black-eyes as were ever sung about.
Still, it was clearly not any fault of
The Bend cricket ground that another
lusty drive later in the innings should
most unluckily have caught a Town leg-
fieldsman—a kin, incidentally, of Blaring,
and of her own shady hue—on a spot
that would have been out of bounds in
boxing, and where, most unfortunately for
himself, if less so for the spectators, he
had a box of wax matches.
These instantly exploding, the unhappy
Tommy let a yell out of him that might
have reminded every possum in the ranges
of Tommy’s predatory ancestors. Also,
grabbing where it hurt most, he leapt
about dancing an unrehearsed and highly
blasphemous corroboree, concluding
with the achievement of his single present

But these things are all part of the

remembered—it was recalled that, the
parlor being unable to accommodate them
all, there was an overflow into the dmmg-

JAMES F. BYRNES: “SPEAKING FRANKLY.”
Based on official records, unpublished
diplomatic documents and the personal
observations specially facilitated by the
writer’s position as President Roosevelt’s
aide before becoming U.S. Secretary of
State, James F. Byrnes’s Speaking Frankly
has been hailed in America as the most
important “inside” book on the war’s
origins and the deals at Yalta and else-
where so far published.
As would be expected, the main theme
of the book is the break with Russia, re-
garding which a N. Y. “Herald Tribune”
Washington correspondent says of
Byrnes’s special qualifications as re-
corder : —•
His official experience spans the precise period
of our enlightenment. He conducted our re-
lations with Russia, was the spearhead of our
thought during an epochal transition —from the
time when our official policy and popular mood
was to be friendly with Russia as an ally in
war-time to when we were compelled to learn
what we now recognise. The purpose and
effect is to tell us what we must accept and
expect.
Speaking of some of the book’s source
materials, Scripps-Howard foreign editor
William Philip Simms mentions that vic-
tory placed many Berlin-Moscow docu-
ments in Allied hands: “The contents
of some are known. Others were sup-
pressed at the Nuremberg trials because
the names of Stalin and Hitler, Molotov
apd Ribbentrop were too closely
coupled.” That associating was in the
dickering for the non-aggression pact
which nothing can disguise as anything
but the Kremlin signing its agreement
for Hitler to start the wan Thus, while
Hitler, for having actually launched the
war, rightly bears the brand of arch war
criminal, the Kremlin junta will not
escape from the indictment of history as
the accessories before the deed.
The Wrangle over Spoils
Dealing with Byrnes’s account of that
callous scheming which led to the war,
and for which none paid a grimmer price
than the country of the supposedly dip-
lomatically clever schemers of the Krem-
lin, Simms recalls that British and French
representatives spent most of the summer
of 1939 in Moscow trying to get Russia
to join the “peace front” against Ger-
many. They failed because they couldn’t
meet Russia’s price. Among other things,
Russia demanded a free hand with the
Baltic republics. The British and French
replied that this territory was not theirs
to give.
Then, while the French and British
were in the parlor in Moscow pleading
the cause of peace, Stalin opened the
back door to Hitler’s Foreign Minister,
Ribbentrop.
On August 19, two weeks before war
broke out, Russia and Germany signed a
trade treaty, says Byrnes. But that
wasn’t what either wanted. They wanted
a non-aggression pact, and Molotov
drafted one. Hitler approved it, and,
answering Stalin, assured him that he,
Hitler, “was not interested in the Baltic
and bordering countries,” which assur-
ance would be placed “in a secret proto-
col attached to the non-aggression pact.”
The secret protocol, Hitler suggested, also
could “set forth the spheres of influence
to be observed by the two nations.”
At the meeting, besides Ribbentrop,
were Stalin, Molotov and Nazi Ambas-
sador Schulenburg. Stalin, says Byrnes,
“insisted that the secret protocol include
a declaration of the Soviet Union’s
special interest in Bessarabia and that the
northern boundaries of Lithuania be
fixed as the line of demarcation between
the Russian and the German spheres of
interest. This was accepted. The pact
and the protocols were approved; Stalin
proposed a toast to Hitler; and Ribben-
trop returned to Berlin.... only nine days
had elapsed.”
Now Hitler was all set. Stalin had
given him the green light. He attacked
Poland and World War II was on. Three
weeks later Stalin had Ribbentrop return
to Moscow to draw up a pact partition-
ing Poland.
But things did not go smoothly between
the partners. The Nazis went into Fin-
land and Rumania, which Moscow didn’t
like. The Red Army overstepped the
bounds in Lithuania, demanded Bessa-
rabia and the Bukovina. So Molotov
went to Berlin in November, 1940. Ob-
serves Byrnes:
Molotov had two conferences with Hitler,
one on the 12th, and the other on the 13th,
each lasting three hours. These discussions
were recorded by Ambassador Paul Schmidt.
POST MORTEM.
In my opinion these visits represent a de-
cisive point in history. For Mr. Molotov
greatly overplayed his hand.
Hitler, says Byrnes, offered Russia
anything it wanted south of the Soviet
Union and as far as India ; Molotov
overplayed his hand by insisting on
settling Eastern Europe first.
In Byrnes’s opinion it was then that
Hitler scented war with Russia. Hitler re-
plied testily that he could not answer
until he had consulted Rome and Sofia.
“And it was here,” says Byrnes, “that
Molotov made his worst blunder. He
insisted upon a definite and immediate
answer.” At which, Ambassador Schmidt
recorded, “Hitler showed great indigna-
tion.”
Thus, Byrnes believes, in six short
hours the fate of the world was changed.
Nor between Russia and Germany were
any questions of high principle or
morality involved. Just a wrangle over
spoils.
Roosevelt to Yalta, 111
Dealing with the Yalta Conference, in
February, 1945 —where so much hap-
pened contributing to the uneasy peace
—Byrnes indicates that there Destiny, as
far as represented by Roosevelt, was per-
sonified by a very sick man. On the ship
going there, says Byrnes, “1 was disturbed
by his appearance.”
No doubt so as not to appear critical
of his dead chief, Byrnes qualifies his
comments: “I am sure that only Presi-
dent Roosevelt, with his intimate know-
ledge of the problems, could have handled
the situation so well with so little prepa-
ration.” But the impression persists that
things might have been shaped very
differently if Roosevelt had been well.
Byrnes states;
So far as I could see, the President had
made little preparation for the Yalta Confer-
ence. His inauguration had taken place the
Saturday before we left and for 10 days pre-
ceding that he had been overwhelmed with
engagements. On the cruiser the President,
Admiral Leahy and I, on four or five occasions,
usually after dinner, discussed some of the
questions to be considered, particularly the
proposal for the United Nations. But not until
the day before we landed at Malta did I learn
that we had on board a very complete file
of studies and recommmendations prepared by
the State Department. I asked the President
if the department had given him any material
and he advised me it was all in the custody
of Lieutenant William M. Rigdon. Later, when
I saw some of these splendid studies I greatly
regretted they had not been considered on
board ship. I am sure the failure to study
them while en route was due to the President’s
illness.
It sounds a singularly poor approach to
a momentous conference; nor was
Roosevelt the only sick man trying to
serve the U.S. and the future of world
peace. The President’s right-hand man,
Harry Hopkins, was in even worse
shape:
Harry was sick confined to his bed most
of the time. His great courage caused him to
attend every session of the conference, but
immediately after adjournment he would re-
tire to his room. Members of our delegation
frequently held meetings there because Dr.
Mclntyre insisted he remain in bed.
A tragically sick team to have had to
encounter the hard bargainers from the
Kremlin.
Churchill on Reparations
Admirers of Winston Churchill should
be well satisfied with Byrnes’s book; in
the Yalta section especially Churchill
often appears as far the wisest man pre-
sent. He appears as the only one taking
the long view of things: he was evidently
as well aware then as many are now that
plant-dismantling and . like reparations
moves in Germany could be overdone.
Byrnes records:
During all the consideration of the German
question at Yalta, reparations were the chief
interest of the Soviet delegation. Maisky,
Deputy Commissar for Foreign Affairs, pro-
posed that 80 per cent, of all German industry
should be withdrawn, specifying the iron and
steel, engineering, metal and chemical indus-
tries. He added that aviation plants, facilities
for *the production of synthetic oil and all
other military enterprises and factories should
be withdrawn entirely.
“By withdrawal 1 mean to confiscate and
carry away physically and use as reparations
payments,” he emphasised.
Mr. Churchill recalled the experience of the
United Kingdom after World War I.
“The process was a very disappointing
one,” he said. “With great difficulty about
£1,000,000,000 was extracted from Germany,
and that would never have been extracted if
the United States, at the same time,'had not
loaned Germany a larger sum.”
“Removal of plants and factories to a cer-
tain extent is a proper step,” he declared, “but
I am quite sure you will never be able to get
out of ruined Germany for Russia alone any-
thing like £215,000,000 a year.” He pictured
Britain’s losses and heavy debts and referred
to the severe losses of other countries which
must be considered in allotting reparations.
“Secondly,” Mr. Churchill continued, “there
arises in my mind the spectre of an absolutely
starving Germany. ♦
“If our treatment of Germany’s internal
economy is such as to leave eighty million
people virtually starving, are we to sit still
and say, ‘lt servos you right,’ or will we be
required to keep them alive? If so, who is
going to pay for that? If you have a horse
and you want him to pull the wagon you
have to provide him with a certain amount of
corn—or at least hay.”
“But the horse must not kick you,” Mr.
Maisky objected.
Mr. Churchill switched to a non-kicking
illustration by saying, “If you have a motor-
car you must give it a certain amount of petrol
to make it go. I am in favor of having a
reparations inquiry committee set up to explore
this subject with the object of getting the most
we can in a sensible way.”
In presenting the position of the United
States, President Roosevelt pointed out that
after the last war we loaned to Germany bil-
lions of dollars, and emphasised “We cannot
let that happen again.”
Marshal Stalin entered the discussion. “The
root of the trouble the last time,” he asserted,
“was that reparations were demanded in money.
Then, the question arose of transferring the
German mark into foreign currencies. That
was the rock upon which reparations broke
down.”
Marshal Stalin urged that the three Powers
that carried the burden of the war should have
priority in reparations. He said it must be
admitted that “France did not have any sacri-
fice to compare to the three Powers I have
in mind.”
There is no doubt that his opinion as to
the claims of a Government was influenced by
the number. of its divisions. He is credited
with having said at Yalta, when reference was
made to the views of the Pope, “How many
divisions does he have?” The Marshal did not
make that statement at Yalta. But it was the
yardstick he frequently used.
Poland’s Boundaries v
In regard also to the fixing of Poland’s
boundaries, history will no doubt list
Churchill as the wise man of the Yalta
dickering, though the immediate victory
—likely to turn out something else in the
long run —went to Stalin:
Closely related to the reparations issue was
the problem of fixing Poland’s boundaries.
President Roosevelt said, at the outset of the
discussion, that the United States felt that
Poland’s eastern boundary should generally
follow the so-called Ctirzon line. He still held,
he said, the view he had expressed at Tehran
that it would be desirable to adjust the southern
end of the line so that the city Lwow and at
least a portion of the oilfields should be inside
Polish territory.
Prime Minister Churchill pointed out he had
supported the Curzon line in Parliament, in-
cluding the Soviet Union’s retention of Lwow.
The claim of the Soviet Union to this area, he
said, “is one not founded on force but upon
right.” But if the Soviet Union made a “mag-
nanimous gesture to a much weaker Power
such as that suggested by the President, Mr.
Churchill said, Britain “would admire and
acclaim the Soviet position.”
Marshal Stalin replied with an impassioned
statement.
“The Curzon line is the line of Curzon and
Clemenceau and of those Americans who took
part in 1918 and 1919 in the conference which
then took place,” Stalin declared. “The Rus-
sians were not invited and did not take part.
Lenin was not in agreement with the
Curzon line Now some people want that we
should be less Russian than Curzon was and
Clemenceau was. You would drive us into
shame. What will be said by the White Rus-
sians and the Ukrainians? They will say that
Stalin and Molotov are far less reliable de-
fenders of Russia than were Curzon and


The British Labour Minister, in introducing the
“1946 Assurance Companies Act,” stated that “The
1946 Act”:—
“Acknowledges the inherently international
and comprehensive character of insurance.”
The Labour President of the Board of Trade in
the House of Commons also stated that it would
be proper to inform the House of the attitude of the
Labour Government toward the future of British
Insurance business. The Government, he stated, had
no intention of interfering with the transaction of
Insurance business by private enterprise. It is, he
stated, the desire of the Government that Insurance
should be, in the future, as in the past, dealt with
on an international basis and as business of an inter-
national character.

Clemenceau. I could not take such a position
arid return to Moscow with an open face.”
At this point Stalin stood at the conference
table as he spoke. It was the only time during
the entire conference that he exhibited his strong
feelings in such a manner.
“I prefer the war should continue a little
longer although it costs us blood and to give
Poland compensation in the west at the ex-
pense of the Germans,” he continued. ‘1
will maintain and 1 will ask all friends to
support me in this... .1 am in favor of extend-
ing the Polish western frontier to the Neisse
River.”
Mr. Churchill doubted the wisdom of extend-
ing the western boundary of Poland to the
Neisse River. He agreed that Poland’s western
boundary should be moved into what had been
German territory, but asserted “it would be a
pity to stuff the Polish goose so full of German
food that he will die of indigestion.” He
estimated that the taking of territory in East
Prussia as far west as the Oder would neces-
sitate the moving of six million Germans.
Stalin protested that the number would be
much smaller because “where our troops come
in, the Germans run away.”
Churchill reminded him that consideration
must be given “to where those Germans are
that run away,” and asked, “Will there be room
for them in what is left of Germany?”
Privately, Churchill expressed to me the
opinion that placing the line at the Neisse River
would mean the transferring of nearly nine
million Germans. Such a number, he asserted,
could never be absorbed in Miat would remain
of Germany.
The discussion was long and earnest, but
Stalin finally accepted the Curzon Line in
principle.
Not only Poland’s boundaries but Poland
itself was one of the most serious issues of
the entire conference. More time \Vas spent
on this subject than on any other. Because
of the intensity of the argument Mr. Roosevelt
would assume a role more of arbiter than of
advocate.
“Britain,” the Prime Minister said, “declared
war on Germany in order that Poland should
be free and sovereign. Everyone knows what
a terrible risk we took and how nearly it cost
us our life in the world, not only as an Empire
but as a Nation. Our interest in Poland is
one of honor. Having drawn the sword in
behalf of Poland against Hitler’s brutal attack,
we could never be content with any solution
that did not leave Poland a free and independent
sovereign State.”
Stalin displayed great earnestness in replying.
“For the Russian people, the question of
Poland is not only a question of honor but also
a question of security. Throughout history
Poland has been the corridor through which
the enemy has passed into Russia. Twice in
the last thirty years our enemies, the Germans,
have passed through this corridor. It is in
Russia’s interest that Poland should be strong
and powerful, in a position to shut the door
of this corridor by her own .force It is
necessary that Poland should be free, indepen-
dent in power. Therefore, it is not only a
question of honor but of life and death for
the Soviet State.”
“In every subsequent discussion,”
Byrnes comments, “the Soviet Govern-
ment has used this argument to justify
what it has done in Poland. Their idea
of a friendly Government is a Govern-
ment completely dominated by them.
Later I discussed the subject with Mr.
Molotov. I could not impress him with
my views that Soviet security would be
better assured by having in Poland a
people who were friendly rather than a
Government that was friendly only be-
cause it was dictated to by the Soviet
Union. Unsuccessfully, I argued that
Governments would come and go, but
that if the Soviet Government’s conduct
in Poland won the friendship of the
people the friendship of the Government
would be assured.”
Stalin and U.N.O.
It would seem that the Kremlin never
had much faith in U.N.O.’s possibilities;
passages in Byrnes’s book probably ex-
plain much that has happened in the
peace organisation. Part of the discus-
sion :
Mr. Churchill: “I know that under the
leaders of the three Powers as represented here
we may feel safe. But these leaders may not
live for ever. In ten years’ time we may dis-
appear. A new generation will come which
did not experience the horrors of war and may
probably forget what we have gone through.
We would like to secure the peace for at least
fifty years. We have now to build up such a
status, such a plan, that we can put as many
obstacles as possible to the coming generation
quarreling among themselves.”
Stalin; “I think that the task is to secure
our unity in the future, and, for this purpose,
we must agree upon such a covenant as would
best serve that purpose. The danger in the'
future is the possibility of conflicts among our-
selves. If there be unity, then the danger from
Germany will not be great. Now we have to
think how we can create a situation where the
three Powers here represented, and China”
Mr. Churchill: “ —and France.”
Stalin: “Yes, and we will keep a united
front.”
Most significant regarding the Krem-
lin’s advance feelings about»U.N.O. was,
as Byrnes notes, Stalin’s having to apolo-
gise to the others for not having studied
a U.S. proposal on U.N.O. voting that
had been sent to him long before, Byrnes
comments:
I was deeply disturbed by the clear evidence
that Stalin had not considered or even read
our proposal on voting in the Security Council
even though it had been sent to him by diplo-
matic air pouch on December 5. This was
February 6, and it occurred to me that if in
those 63 days he had not familiarised himself
with the subject, he could not be greatly in-
terested in the United Nations organisation.
It was all the more impressive since this cer-
tainly was the only proposal on the agenda
with which he was not entirely familiar.
Byrnes reveals for the first time the
full story of how Roosevelt came to ask
for extra U.N.O. votes for the U.S. in
return for the Soviet’s securing the extra
votes granted Byelorussia and Ukraine,
on the pure fiction that these are inde-
pendent countries. Apparently Roose-
velt —he must haye been sick indeed —
at first agreed to Russia having those
RIPE FRUIT.
N.Y. “Sun.”
extra votes without mentioning any
equalising votes for America. Byrnes,
who heard of this subsequently, says:
“I was surprised at the agreement, which,
in my opinion, was very unwise.” The
upshot was that, on Byrnes’s representa-
tions, Roosevelt then asked for three
votes for the U.S., and Russia, in fact,
agreed, but Roosevelt seems to have
reached a stage past caring:
The President and his advisers concluded not
to ask at San Francisco for compliance with
the agreement that we have as many votes as
were given to Russia. He did not again discuss
the subject with me, and I did not know he
had changed his mind. I admit that the public
opposition to Russia’s three votes as against
our one was not so great as I had expected.
But nevertheless I think we should have in-
sisted at San Francisco on the agreement made
at Yalta. I felt then and feel now that the
smaller States would have opposed the request
of the Soviets and the United States. This
course would have been just and it would have
resulted in both Governments having only one
vote. That would have been the best solution.
Byrnes speaks of “another agreement
made at Yalta which was to confront me
later”: this was “the ‘Top Secret’ proto-
col in which it was agreed that in return
for Soviet participation in the war against
Japan the Kurile Islands would be
handed over to the Soviet Union,” along
with other like concessions. How it hap-
pened was that, business apparently com-
pleted, the conference was thought
ended; —
But that afternoon Stalin requested the
President to remain one more day. He said
they could not conclude their work and he
wished to discuss some matter he deemed
important. The President complied. The
agreement as to the Kurile Islands was reached
in private conversation among the Big Three
instead of at the conference table.
Byrnes knew nothing of it till after he
had become Secretary of State, where-
upon he asked for “those documents at
the White House containing agreements
with foreign Governments, I wanted to
know how many IOUs were outstand-
ing.”
The Tide Turns
As Byrnes records it,-Yalta was the
high, and final, peak of Big Three unity.
Very soon afterwards the great change
began to show; indicated by Byrnes in a
chapter headed “The Tide Begins to
Turn.” Though he had evidently earlier
believed in the possibility of continued
co-operation with a well-secured but not
expansionist Soviet, Byrnes appears to
have become aware of the tragic truth as
a result of a dinner alone with Molotov
at the time of the Foreign Ministers’
meeting in London in 1945;
After failing in every effort to reach an
understanding, I finally gave up and
It was a gloomy Sunday evening for the
American delegation. We talked over this inter-
view and the problems it raised for a long time.
It seemed that the Soviet Union was determined
to dominate Europe.
On the tactics of Molotov and other
Soviet representatives at that time and
since Byrnes comments:
The record of these negotiations amply
demonstrates the ingenuity of the Soviet dele-
gation at bargaining and log-rolling in the
pursuit of their objectives; it illustrates their
willingness to block agreement on a non-
controversial, universally accepted proposal, in
order to obtain concessions on some wholly
unrelated issue they consider important
Some of the reasons and the amendments he
[Molotov] offered were so irrelevant and absurd
they indicated a deliberate intent to make
certain they could not be accepted... .The
discussion made it clear that he had no idea
of discussing the treaty in a serious manner
but was simply looking for excuses for delay.
And my patience was exhausted.
On this, Byrnes reaches the conclusion
arrived at by other observers of Soviet
manoeuvrings—-that the Kremlin has
clumsily brought about precisely what it
must have desired to avoid :
Tactics such as these by M. Molotov and
his satellite associates served to create the
Western bloc that he charged us with seeking
to build. Had we wanted to create a bloc he
did the job far too effectively for us to have
interfered.
Force, if Necessary
One account in the book leaves the
impression that Roosevelt must have died
a very disappointed man. A month after
Yalta, Roosevelt, who had apparently
staunchly believed in continuing Russian
co-operation, had to tell Byrnes that he
had grave misgivings about the future
relations of U.S.-Soviet. At the same
time Churchill told the President that
agreements were already breaking down
and only serious consequences could re-
sult.
Then, just before Roosevelt’s death,
Stalin, says Byrnes, “greatly offended him
by accusing him in exceedingly objection-
able language” of secretly concluding a
Separate peace with Germany. Roose-
velt protested against what he called “the
vile misrepresentations of Stalin’s in-
formers,” whom he accused of fomenting
discord between Russia and the U.S.
After thus affirming his faith in Stalin
by shifting the blame, it must have been
the last bitter dregs for Roosevelt when
Stalin stood by his informers and re-
jected the President’s explanations.
An hour before he died Roosevelt
wrote to Churchill regarding relations
with Russia that “we must be firm....
our course thus far is correct.” Roose-
velt, says Byrnes, had reached the con-
clusion that “there is no easy formula to
guide one in getting along with” Soviet
Russia. The President’s messages to
Churchill near the end “dispose of the
legend that our relations with the Soviet
Unibn began to deteriorate only after his
death.” ,
The frankest shaking in the book
concerns future dealings with Russia,
which, Byrnes concludes, has the definite
ultimate goal of dominating the whole
of Europe. Satisfied on that as final,
Byrnes advocates abolishing the Council
of Foreign Ministers and the calling of a
full-dress peace conference of all nations
on Germany early next year. If Russia
refuses to agree to the “Big Five” calling
that conference the other four should go
on with drawing up a draft treaty for
Germany to be signed by the Western
German Governments.
The United States, Byrnes urges,
should apply the Truman doctrine to
Hungary, demand that the Russians re-
lease 500,000 Japanese prisoners being
used as slave laborers, refuse to get out
of Korea until the Russian-trained
Korean Army is disbanded, and insist
that the Big Four Foreign Ministers
have nothing to do with the Japanese
peace treaty.
Byrnes also declares that a settlement
with Russia on Germany could be fixed
up tomorrow if other countries would
agree to give Russia the reparations it
wants —£2,500,000,000 —and equal control
in the Ruhr. Byrnes speaks at his frank-
est regarding steps in the event of Russia
still holding out after a treaty had been
signed with Western Germany. If, he
suggests, Russia refused to sign the
drafted treaty under threat of loss of any
treaty benefits, and refused also to with-
draw the Soviet troops from Eastern
Germany, other nations should ask the
Security Council to order Russia out, and
if Russia vetoes this move in the Security
Council —as, of course, it would —“The
United States and as many other nations
as will join her,” says Byrnes, “must drive
the Russians out by force.”
Reports Worse than Stated. —In the couise
of a wordy serial wrangle with Vishinsky,
consisting mostly of one shouting “You’re a
liar!” and the other responding “You’re
another!” N.Y. “Daily Mirror” columnist
Walter Winchell broadcast as “a secret the
U.S. Government hadn’t the heart to tell the
nation”: “The reports from American ambas-
sadors in every European capital are far, far
grimmer than the American public suspects or
will ever be told. We are losing the ‘cold
war.’ ”

THE CAIN-CHIFLEY WRECK.
Before last Saturday evening was half-
way through it was easy to perceive, from
the behavior of Mr. Calwell s national
broadcasting organisation, that “Labor
was getting a man-sized licking. The
inter-State hook-up treated the returns in
a fashion perfunctory and disinterested.
After the first tell-tale progress returns it
was difficult to get from “the A.B.C. inter-
state programme” figures describing
the extent of the “Labor” disaster. Yet
the issue was of first-class interest
throughout the Commonwealth.
That the Cains would lose perhaps
half a dozen seats held by narrow margins
was fairly certain. But that constituencies
like Box Hill, Dandenong, Essendon,
Oakleigh, Dundas and Wonthaggi should
turn on the Socialists so decisively
stamped the quality of the decision.
“Labor” will face the new Assembly with
only half its former numbers, counting
Mr. Mutton (Coburg), who always voted
with the party, among them. Most sig-
nificant was the response in city and
country to the Liberal party’s appeal.
This feature of the polling on top of the
great rally of the Country party set the
seal on the “Labor” debacle.
Had “Labor” won there would have
been a howl of triumph from Melbourne
and Canberra, claiming not only condem-
nation of' the Victorian Legislative
Council’s temerity, but also a demonstra-
tion of the people’s support, on a first-class
test, for the Chifley Government’s sociali-
sation legislation. Calwell radio-boys
would have made the welkin ring with
victory chants all through Saturday night
and every day since. “Contrariwise,” the
lesson-is thus also salutary. The Victorian
electors have completely rebuffed every
“Labor” argument. The Leg. Council’s
action has their emphatic approval and
endorsement. The Council is declared en-
tirely right in having refused Supply in
order to force the Cain Government to
the country to provide a test, which the
Chifleys refused, of popular opinion on
the banking bill. That calm and the
silence in the electorates noticed by candi-
dates during the latter half of the cam-
paign are now explained.
The Victorian people had made up their
minds. They detest “Labor’s” socialisa-
tion plans, they condemn the deceitful
way in which legislation upon those plans
has been introduced, and they have said
in the plainest possible fashion that they
will not have this tyranny foisted upon
them. The majority of Australians is at
one with the Victorian people on all these
counts.
Mr. Chifley must now think again.
Hitherto he has taken up the attitude that
public protests will not move him from
his course, that the Bank Grab Bill —
its second-reading stage not concluded
at the week-end—shall go through. Well,
not only Liberal and Country-party sup-
porters but many “Labor” adherents also
have warned him to pause and reconsider
his defiance of the popular will. Either
he will pay heed to that warning now, or
he will be inciting public opinion in every
State to drive home the message from Vic-
toria.
“As a House of Privilege,” the “Labor”
campaigners said, “the Victorian Legis-
lative Council could have been guilty of
no more extreme and provocative act
than to refuse Supply to a people’s Gov-
ernment,” The people’s answer is that
extreme provocative acts, in defi-
ance of “Labor’s” claim to govern in the
way it is doing, are to their taste. The
Victorian Legislative Council’s action,
and the motives that prompted it, are
hailed as faithful stewardship.
Next events should follow very soon
if Mr. Chifley will not pay heed to the
Victorian verdict. He cannot send this
protest, like the petitions rained upon
Ministers at Canberra, to the official in-
cinerator. He must do something that
acknowledges respect for this event be-
fore he proceeds further. His best course
would be to withdraw the bill pending
the result of a referendum upon it. If
he will not do that, it is at least his duty
to defer the bill until after the next
general elections. If he will do neither
of these things a petition to the King
from all the States and Territories would
be the natural recourse of a people deter-
mined that their will shall be respected.
The Victorian poll has afforded good
warrant for much more than mere
petitions against any continued defiance
at Canberra of popular opinion.
N.G. in Evening Dress.
An expressive photograph now being cir-
culated by visitors to Australia is a com-
plete epitome of conditions in the terri-
tory of Papua-New Guinea. It is a pic-
ture of a native wedding at Hanuabada.
The bridegroom is decked out in evening
dress, with bride to match. All round
are brown brothers and sisters in
various stages of undress and cleanliness,
grinning hugely. It is a picture not only
of the post-war native life as lived in the
age of Ward, but of the whole of the
Territory which forms the outer fortress
gate to Australia.
There the whole place is in evening
dress. No native need work unless he
wants to. Model villages, health systems,
education systems rise under the hands
of theorists, all paid by the people of the
Commonwealth and by the planters who
pioneered the place, and who are now
leaving it as fast as boats can take them.
Copra production is carried on only
because of boom prices. When an era
of reasonably normal prices and demand
arrives, the business will become the ex-
clusive preserve of big companies.
Gold, which was worth more than
£2,700,000 per annum to the Territory up
to 1941, now, for the most part, lies un-
collected in the creeks, because there is
no native labor to dredge or sluice it. The
goldmining industry is, like the copra
industry, almost entirely in the hands of
the Big Monopolists whom the Govern-
ment professes to hate, while the natives
enjoy their perennial wedding feast and
learn the gospel of loaf, with the bless-
ing of a Minister who pampers them in
accordance with, if not in pursuance of,
a plan to turn “colonial peoples” into
“free peoples” by making them so lazy
and cheeky that only a Communist
regime can manage them.
Copra, of course, is the main staple
industry of the New Guinea territory.
Before the war, from 1934, its price fluc-
tuated from £7 to £l3 per ton, having
reached its peak, £23 15s. per ton, in
1925, and gone into decline during the
depression. Today the price has soared
to seven times the 1934 price, and yet
planters are leaving the Territory because
the life is unattractive. The industry is,
of course, socialised. The method of
managing it, applied to an area which has
lost its legislative councils, has no elec-
toral rights and is completely in the grip
of one surly Minister, is a foretaste of
what is promised for the whole Common-
wealth.
The copra production of roughly
90,000 tons (Papua included) must be
sold to the last husk through a Control
Board. Many planters cannot get sacks
because they cannot get advances from
the board. They can get no advances at
all in the Rabaul district, which produces
one-third of the whole of the copra
turned out of the islands, because there
is only a Commonwealth Bank branch
there. At Lae and Moresby planters are
better off because the Bank of N. S.
Wales functions there —it doesn’t in
Rabaul because it has been denied the
facilities —and gives planters normal
financial accommodation.
Last month, according to that able and
trenchant critic of New Guinea affairs
R. W. Robson, New Guinea copra was
being sold to manufacturers in Australia
at £5l ss. per ton. Production Board
returns to planters were £35 2s. per ton,
leaving (after reckoning normal freight
and selling costs of £4 per ton) about
£l2 per ton profit to the board. Mr.
Robson commented:
The Australian Government is taking in
profit, out of a system of trading that it
has forced upon the planters, a larger
amount per ton than the world market
was paying altogether for copra just prior
to World War 11.
Taxed with this charge by Mr. White
in Parliament on October 15, Mr. Ward
blithely admitted that his board was with-
holding £6 per ton on production for “a
market-stabilisation fund,” to be used in
times of stress for the benefit of the
planters. The unexpectant beneficiaries
have become of so little importance in
the new socialised scheme that they were
not told—or not told clearly—what was
being done on their behalf.
Meanwhile, with copra at unprece-
dented price levels and gold and timber
in the same position, every year sees the
rich New Guinea area less and less able
to pay its way as it rollicks through its
wedding feast and becomes more and
more inebriated administratively and un-
welcome guests depart for other shores.
The position is reflected in the 1946-47
Treasury returns. As a “colony” man-
aged on totalitarian lines, Papua-New
Guinea is not subject to true Parliamen-
tary control. Its local taxation and
revenue are collected and spent at the
sweet will of Minister and “Government”
without proper supervision of the details.
The part of the cost debited to the
Australian taxpayers is lumped in the esti-
mates under ten headings, nearly all of it
specified as “grant to provisional
Administration towards expenses, includ-
ing native welfare, development, war
damage and reconstruction.”
These and figures published in the Ter-
ritories “Gazette” on October 1 provide
a measuring stick for the shocking con-
dition of affairs which rules in an area
for which the “Government” is respon-
sible not only to the electors but to
U.N.O. Out of £2,500,000 spent on ad-
ministration of Papua-New Guinea in
1946-47, local taxpayers found £464,000
and Australian taxpayers £2,018,000.
Before the war New Guinea had wiped
out its public debt to the Commonwealth.
The annual grant to Papua was only
£40,000. The two territories raised
£686,000 and lived roughly within it.
Gold royalty brought in £143,000 in
1939-40 ; £10,500 in 1946-47.
It is no wonder that Mr. Chifley, upon
hearing the facts from a returned-soldier
deputation, ordered Mr. Ward to intrude
at the feast and try to restore something
like sanity and order as the “Govern-
ment” conceives sanity and order.
Soviet's Lost "Face.”
When historians are able from the
future’s perspective to take the full view
of our times, they will probably write
that World War II finished in Europe
not in June, 1945, but years later. How
many years later nobody today can say.
But the appreciation possible currently
should at least permit us to proceed about
peace-making from the premise that
Vyshinsky’s blitherings about American
“war-mongering” at U.N.O. Assembly
do not so much foreshadow a new war
as reflect expiring flickers among the
embers of that from which the world is
just, and only just, surviving.
Incidentally, Vyshinsky, whose instruc-
tions for U.N.O. were presumably to try
to restore the “face” lost through Molo-
tov’s blundering diplomacy at the Paris
Conference, has merely lost a bit more.
If the Russian objective was to sabotage
support for the Marshall Plan in Europe
and the United States, it has failed. At
Paris Molotov’s efforts hastened the for-
mation of that “Western bloc” which is
Moscow’s pet aversion, and at U.N.O.
Vyshinsky’s tirades have merely consoli-
dated American opinion behind President
Truman’s appeal for aid of Western
Europe and greatly simplified the task of
persuading Congress to approve the
means.
In Western Europe, too, the democ-
racies have had just about enough of
Soviet intransigence. The problem is to
make peace, and Moscow has so far
refused to allow peace to be made. The
municipal elections in France, England,
Wales, Scotland and, to a less emphatic
degree, in Norway also have shown that
in these democracies political intelligence
is ‘reviving from the anaesthesia of war-
time. Steady going people have had
enough of the whole silly business of pre-
tending that prosperity is a matter of pro-
paganda, that regimentation of every-
body’s daily life is the panacea for peace
on earth, and that every citizen who
cannot be given a Government job ought
to be put in charge of some bureaucrat
as his warder.
There could be nothing more galling
to the Englishman with any spirit than
the spectacle of his country, but two
generations ago the leader of the world
in manufacturing skill and trading enter-
prise, respected alike for its material
wealth and its administrative competence,
its people’s sense and practice of political
freedom a beacon-light to all other
nations, now reduced to living on starva-
tion rations as though this were some in-
escapable affliction and indebted to ovei-
seas charity for that dole. The revolt
from' this state was always certain and
has plainly begun. John Bull, however
much exhausted, is not going to die in
that sort of ditch. The French people, no
less proud of race, are exhibiting much
the same temper.
Whatever Europe may represent in the.
future depends upon their recovery. Two
years’ usurpation of European leadership
by Russia has Been warning enough. The
condition of economic starvation and of
bitter political division on the Continent
during that period has remained just
where the cessation of open hostilities
left it. That “coming depression” with
which the Socialists in Australia,
too—have fed the democracies by way
of justification for their ruinous policies
began by being propaganda and may yet
be synthetically produced if they are
allowed to “govern” for much longer.
Apart from the awakening as shown
by the municipal elections in Britain and
France, the very policy being forced
upon Western Europe reveals the Social-
ist failure. The Socialists remedy for
economic weakness in the West, like that
of the Communists for the weakness of
Russia, is to cut off international trade.
Those theorists who tell us today how
stupid was the deflation remedy applied
in the depression of the ’thirties are them-
selves practising deflation today. They
don’t say “Restrict credit and reduce
purchase of goods” ; they say “Restrict
imports and deny consumer goods to the
home market.” Results are much the
same. The Marshall Plan is essentially
one to enable Europe to import goods,
even though for the time being it cannot
export sufficiently for them. The Social-
ists’ plan, restriction of imports, is thus
rejected as a cure ; and their creed of
nationalising private enterprise in indus-
try, thereby killing production “stone
dead,” cannot last either.
A turning from Socialism by the West
will not, however, alone be sufficient.
The economic weakness of Europe will
endure so long as the “iron curtain” cuts
it in two, prohibiting exchange between
the industrial West and the agricultural
East. Mr. Byrnes, in the book Speaking
Frankly, crystallises that truth. He
demonstrates also the falsity of the be-
lief on which Russia has pursued power-
politics for two years —namely, that
the United States would grow tired
of propping up Europe and pull out. If
Congress, with its Republican majority,
supports the Truman aid bill, for which
it has now been specially summoned,
then Moscow can bid good-bye to any
prospect that the American elections next
year might frustrate or delay the opera-
tion of the Marshall Plan.
During the past three weeks the British
press has recorded a revival of hope
that, after all, the Foreign Ministers’
Council, due to reassemble in London on
the German question a fortnight hence,
may not bring about a final breakdown
in relations. The change dates from the
return of a party of British “Labor”
Ms.P., headed by the pro-Moscow
Finnish-born Zilliacus, from a visit to
Russia.
Zilliacus says he was told by Stalin that
the Soviet Government was “prepared to
go halfway to meet” Britain and the
United States in co-operation, regardless
of difference in economic and social
systems. Stalin used the same • lan-
guage to Mr. Stassen not long ago, and
the phrase may mean no more now than
it did then. But Sir Stafford Cripps ap-
plied a test by observing, in a House of
Commons statement, that, if the Russians
would consent, the negotiations for an
Anglo-Russian trade agreement, ship-
wrecked several months ago, would be
resumed. It turned up heads; the talks
are on again, and the new president of
the Board of Trade is flying to Moscow
this week. Before the Foreign Ministers
meet, therefore, the chances of this trade
treaty and the Congress’s attitude on the
Truman aid bill should both be made
known. The pact of 21 nations at
Geneva for a lowering of tariffs has also
given a new impetus to international trade
without Russia.
Russia has been cracking hardy, but
her own economic strains and deficiencies
are no longer a secret, despite the cen-
sorship on communications with the
world beyond the iron curtain. Only
by desperate efforts has Moscow held
the States of the Eastern bloc from join-
ing the Marshall Plan’s acceptors. They
are starved for machinery and textiles
and all the manufactures they once
bought in the old German market, and
they are the more starved because what-
ever they can produce at home is
claimed first and foremost for Moscow’s
own five-year plan. “Co-prosperity” with
Russia affords these States nothing.
“Pravda” has admitted that industrial re-
covery is lagging, and Vyshinsky himself
told the foreign press at the Moscow ses-
sion of the Foreign Ministers’ Council
last April that without reparations from
German current production the carrying
out of the five-year plan would be very
difficult. That was an admission that
Russia is as much in need of outside help
as any other European country.
Some details are becoming known.
The Czechoslovak harvest has failed —it
will be about 40 per cent, below nor-
mal—and the 200,000 tons of grain
which Russia, with loud advertisement,
recently began delivering to the Czechs
came not from Russia, but from Hun-
gary — reparation deliveries. Much of
Poland’s winter-sown wheat was lost,
and the deficit there is 600,000 tons.
Rumania and Yugoslavia are both short,
especially Rumania, normally the granary
of the lower Danube. In Russia itself
coal production is lagging (“Izvestia” says
they can’t get ahead with mechanisation
of mines), heavy industry and the rail-
ways likewise ; the housing programme,
“Pravda” admits, is not being fulfilled,
and the number of bricks turned but is
only one-third of what the plan demands.
These are official Soviet press commen-
taries on the results for the second
quarter of this year. “The speed of
harvesting,” says “Pravda” of July 26,
“does not yet secure the timely collection.


of the harvest and avoidance of grain
losses.... Combine harvesting is particu-
larly unsatisfactory.”
Communication of these facts to the
world outside Russia is “treason,” and
leaders of the resentful Peasant parties
in the puppet States are everywhere dead
or in jeopardy. Mikolajczyk of Poland
has escaped, like Ferenc Nagy of Hun-
gary, but they caught Maniu in Rumania
as they did Petkov in Bulgaria, and he
will doubtless be executed as Petkov was.
These men were popular patriots and
leaders of majority parties in what Mos-
cow calls “democracies.” But, dead or
exiled, their fate has exposed the Russian
bluff.
It should be called finally at the
Foreign Ministers’ meeting in London.
PLAIN ENGLISH
Canberra and Westminster.
Mr. F. M. Daly is a very fortunate
young “Labor” politician, thrice fortu-
nate in being a member at Canberra,
not at Westminster. At Westminster the
blithe admission that he had taken money
from departments for “work performed”
on his dollar-squandering globe-trotting
tour —one of the admissions is that one
of the departments, Dr. Evatt’s, paid the
Daly hotel expenses, “plus seven dollars
50 cents a day”—would have resulted
in his seat being declared vacant.
Now that the gloves are off at Can-
berra the Opposition should tarry no
longer in challenging Mr. Daly’s right to
retain his seat. It may mean the suspen-
sion of some member, as Mr. McEwen
was suspended last week for objecting to
being stigmatised as a liar, and that by a
Minister, or by reason of another foul
non-starter attack on a returned-soldier
member such as the unspeakable “Labor”
publican Mulcahy vomited at the gallant
Blain, A.I.F. veteran of two wars —
wounded in the first and a Jap captive,
worn to a shadow by Oriental savagery,
in the second. But in these matters those
who choose to be blind or one-eyed or to
sling muck are not necessarily the final
arbiters of events.
At Canberra the “powers, privileges and
immunities” of members and also their re-
sponsibilities and disabilities, when dis-
abilities apply, are substantially the same
as those obtaining at Westminster. And
even under Labor the House of Commons
scrupulously holds members to their pre-
scriptive duties, as well as being careful
of their privileges and rights.
Mr. Herbert Morrison was in his place
as Leader when the Commons dealt with
the cases of Mr. Allighan (“Labor,”
Gravesend) and Mr. Heighway, editor of
the “World’s Press News,” reported on
by the Committee of Privileges. On Mr.
Morrison’s motion the House declared
that an article written by Allighan and
published by Heighway, “particularly by
its unfounded imputations against un-
known members of insobriety in the
precincts,” amounted to “gross contempt
of this House.” Further Morrison
motions declared that Allighan, “in per-
sistently misleading the Committee of
Privileges and in seeking to cast sus-
picions on' others,” had committed “a
grave contempt,” and that “in corruptly
accepting payment for the disclosure
of information obtained from other
members under obligation of secrecy,”
Allighan was “guilty of dishonorable
conduct which deserves to be severely
punished.”
The punishment was expulsion, for
which 102 Ministerialists, as well as two
Communists, voted. To Heighway the
Speaker said “In the name of the House
I reprimand you for a gross offence
against it,” and “I direct you to with-
draw.” Then, in the words of the “Times”
report, Heighway, who, like Allighan,
had made an abject apology, “bowed three
times, and the Sergeant-at-Arms escorted
him from the Chamber.”
There followed the affair of Mr. Walk-
den (“Labor,” Doncaster), concerning
whom Mr. Morrison moved that “Mr.
Walkden, in corruptly accepting payment
for the disclosure of information
obtained from other members under the
pledge of secrecy, is guilty of dishonor-
able conduct which deserves to be severely
punished.” The punishment was a repri-
mand, administered by the Speaker, “in
the name of the House for your offence
against its honor,” after the member had
been “brought in by the Sergeant-at-
Arms and had bowed to the Chair.” His
resignation was thereupon demanded by
the Doncaster “Labor” organisation, and
he weighed in with it, whimpering that
he would carry on as an Independent.
The Opposition should arm itself with
the “Times” accounts of these cases and
proceed to tackle the “Government” on
the Daly affair, meanwhile turning up
precedents. It is on record that a Syd-
ney Government (Reid’s) was voted
out of office, chiefly by “Labor” mem-
bers, because it had paid a globe-trot-
ting follower £350 —chicken-feed to Mr.
Daly, Senator Amour and Mr. Lewis, or
whatever his name is, and the rest of the
“Labor” and Communist tourists —as ex-
penses of a report on “European
charities.”
The Five-and-nine Wheat,
Archie Cameron challenged the “Gov-
ernment” to deny that “Labor” New
Zealand, to which the Government sold
18 million bushels of wheat at ss. 9d.
when the export price was nearly three
times that figure, is selling flour for ex-
port at a price based on wheat at a pound
or more. Minister Pollard could not
deny it, but said something impudent
about “Labor” New Zealand being en-
titled to do what it pleased with* its own
imports. “Labor” takes leave to do what
it pleases, under .forms of law, with other
people’s property.
The sale at ss. 9d. of wheat worth a
pound and more was excused on the
ground that the “Government” had
“guessed wrong.” The “Government”
guessed also that the first year’s cost of
the infamous transaction to the taxpayers
would be £2,000,000, and again it
guessed wrong. The £2,000,000 appro-
priated for 1947-48 has already proved
insufficient, and if the export price re-
mains in the neighborhood of a pound
the total cost to the taxpayers will be
round £10,000,000.
Another “Labor” excuse for the sale
at ss. 9d. was that “Labor” New Zealand
HIT, RUN AND SQUIB.
“Mr. Chifley said 'I have no comment to make one way or the other'.”
had made “concessions” to Australia.
These “concessions” were unspecified,
and a curious N.Z. M.H.R. asked Mr.
Pollard’s opposite number, Mr. Nord-
meyer, what exactly they were. Mr.
Nordmeyer said he didn’t know.
The N.Z. bakers have been asking
their Government to let them raise the
price of bread, pointing out that it hasn’t
been raised for 11 years, though wages
and all other costs have gone up and
working hours gone down. The appli-
cation was refused, but the Government
reduced the price of flour to “all bakers
and pastrycooks” by 12s. 6d. a ton. It
must in large part be flour made from
Australian wheat bought at ss. 9d. The
crowd responsible for letting its friends
on the other side of the Tasman have
wheat at ss. 9d. is, of course, certain that
it knows how to run banking to perfec-
tion and with spotless impartiality, and
that nobody else does.
Lewis and Others.
Reporting to the Canadian Government
on developments of the Communist con-
spiracy in the senior Dominion, with
particular reference to the espionage un-
covered by the “Mounties,” two Supreme
Court Justices laid stress on Communist
corruption in the civil service. As a
result of these investigations and con-
clusions, a Canadian M.P. was convicted
and sentenced to a long term of impris-
onment. Influenced by the Canadian
measures, the Government at Washing-
ton entered upon a policy of ridding
the public service of Communists, and
Congress, for its part, decided to refuse
National Labor Board privileges to any
union with Communists on its executive.
Deportation proceedings against foreign-
born Communists were forthwith entered
upon.
All these occurrences left Australian
“Labor” Governments cold. Australian
“Labor” Governments are committed to
the Red i.e., Communist objective.
All these Governments are maintained
in office by Catholic “Labor” members,
whose Church is engaged in a mortal
struggle with Moscow; but that doesn t
seem to matter a dump.
In the time of the “Labor” Govern-
ment at Canberra, one Communist after
another has been sent abroad to rep-
resent Australia.” The latest of the litter
is one Samuel Phineas Lewis, of the
N.S.W. Teachers’ Federation. Lewis’s
record as a Communist has been exposed
in precise terms by Mr. Lang. The Prime
Minister did not dispute any count in
the Lang indictment. Did he say he
would recall Mr. Lewis (or whatever the
fellow’s name is) and replace him with a
serviceman? He did not. Mr. Lewis
could have been a serviceman in 1939,
being then 38, but he preferred to be
a “Russophile”’ and to campaign for
peace with Hitler, until Hitler turned
upon his pal Stalin, whereupon the
“imperialist” war become a holy war.
Mr. Lewis is a Jew. There are
scores of Australian servicemen of the
Jewish faith who have vastly superior
qualifications for representation at
U.N.E.5.C.0., the mission to which Mr.
Lewis has been assigned, but, perhaps
because they were servicemen, their
claims were ignored. One of Mr. Lewis’s
champions is Mr. Heffron, the N.S.W.
Minister of Education, who was very
thick with Communists in other days.
By slow degrees Mr. Heffron let it out
that Mr. Lewis, his U.N.E.S.C.O. assign-
ment completed at the Commonwealth
taxpayers’ expense, would receive full pay
from the N.S.W. Education Department
— i.e., from N.S.W. taxpayers —for five
months, during which, according to Mr.
Lang, he is to spend some time at
Belgrade, the Cominform headquarters.
According to Mr. Heffron, “some
Americans define a Communist as the
type of person who disagrees with you
or exposes your racket.” There are
other definitions, and they should move
parents to be careful of the quality
and drift of schooling ladled out to
their children under the Heffron adminis-
tration.
Coal and Canberra.
According to “the highest authority in
Canberra,” Premier Hanlon’s starry-eyed
vision of a Queensland Coal Authority
to “supervise the development” of Blair
Athol and other fields has faded like the
soldier’s hope for land and the people’s
hope for homes.
“N. Q. Register” puts it this way:
It is considered highly improbable that
Mr. Chifley will be prepared to accede to
a request from the Premier for the appoint-
ment of a coal authority on which Queens-
land has majority representation The
Commonwealth’s (that is, the bureaucracy’s)
feeling is that the joint Commonwealth
Coal Board should be charged with the
development of Queensland coal resources,
with some Queensland officers to assist.
In other words, the Federal bureaucrats
aren’t going to let these State chaps in on
anything if they can help it. Centralisa-
tion of all power in Canberra is their aim,
and since war-time controls and subse-
quent continuance of them have given
them a taste, not only of that power
but of the good jobs attached to it, they’ll
keep what they have and grab for more.
Mr, Hanlon must be feeling a bit
dashed about it, especially since he’s just
had a confabulation with Mr, R. W. Foot,
of the Powell Duffryn Technical Services,
who has had a look over Queensland
coalfields with the notion of working some
of them. Anyhow, Powell Duffryn are to
be appointed as consultants to the Han-
lons on coal, of which the State is esti-
mated to have more than 2,000,000,000
tons, and will use three engineers and a
chemist on a 12 months’ survey.
Mr. Hanlon also has an “ultimatum”
from the Communist-bossed Miners’
Federation that unless the Joint Coal Act
is extended to Queensland by January 12
it will call all Queensland coalies out on
strike. Communists don’t like the notion
of working the Queensland fields by open-
cut, since most of the men on the work
would be A.W.U. members and the
A.W.U. won’t have a bar of Communism.
The Hanlons hope their miners won’t fall
for the Communist stunt —a couple of
months ago they accepted a Hanlon
promise that he would set up a Joint Coal
Board with a majority of Queenslanders
on it. If he can’t get an agreement with
Canberra he aims at a State Coal Board.
Queensland dislikes the Canberra
“Labor” dictators as much as it dislikes
Communists. It knows that it has tre-
mendous resources in coal and other
minerals, and it wants them developed.
It has fastened a cold speculative eye
upon its Premier, so profuse of promises,
so piffling in performance.
The Amazing Mac Kay.
In whatever else it may be equalled or
surpassed by other cities, Sydney at least
has a unique Police Commissioner. Every
few months or so its Boss Cop, a Mr.
Mac Kay, blurts out something or is con-
cerned in some exploit which attracts
notice.
There was, for instance, the occasion
when, returning, as he said, from a do-
mestic carpet-laying expedition, Mr. Mac-
Kay sighted a homing Government bus.
Being in a fast car, he chased the bus,
caught up with it and accused the crew of
being drunk. There ensued a Court case
which left Mr. Mac Kay with a flea in his
ear. Nothing daunted, he proceeded to
solve the Pyjama Girl “mystery.” After
10 years and an expenditure of £70,000
he traced the slayer to the joint run by
friend Romano, the slayer being a hat-
check waiter who had taken the Mac Kay
cady into custody hundreds of times.
Early this year there" arose a Sergeant
Keogh with the complaint, made at a
policemen’s conference, that as a sequel
to his having opposed open gambling at
a Peak Hill sports meeting, he had been
transferred to Bathurst, At the subse-
quent inquiry Mr. Mac Kay described
Keogh as a live sergeant: a man who
would tell the truth even against him-
self ; a first-class man and on the job all
the time. Withal “a pain in the neck to
me.” Why?
He is Irish and I am Scotch; perhaps
that is one reason. Disloyal? No more
-than any Irishman is disloyal.
Scotia’s son then said he had transferred
Keogh to Bathurst to cope with an “out-
break of immorality” in the old city, and
Judge Kirby found that the transfer had
been made in “the ordinary course of his
(Mr. Mac Kay’s) administration.”
Concerned in the Peak Hill affair was
an ex-sergeant, one Joe Ryan, who had
resigned from the force to “conduct a
night club called the Roosevelt.” This
Joe Ryan, a son-in-law who ran a pub,
and other kindred spirits “financed” the
sports meeting to which the obstinate
Keogh had objected.
It was admitted by Joe Ryan that he
was “able to approach Mr. Mac Kay
about a small matter affecting Rose’s
Restaurant,” another night club in which
Joe was “interested.” Not long after-
wards the “reformed” Liquor Act
(McKell’s) fell upon licensed clubs like
a ton of bricks and Mr. Mac Kay sternly
warned club secretaries that it would be
no use trying to see him to “fix. things
up.” In the course of events things were
“fixed up” by the Full Court, leaving the
McKell Act a thing of shreds and patches.
In June it was announced that Mr.
Mac Kay’s department was “concerned at
the mounting number of resignations of
senior officers and the insufficient supply”
of police recruits, the force being 222
short of strength. If Mr. Mac Kay had
any doubt of it he was quickly convinced.
Summoned to a Sydney pub to quell a
closing-time brawl, evidently by a person
who enjoys his friendship or acquaintance,
he grabbed an 18-year-old soldier, locked
him in a room, after suffering some per-
sonal damage, and went for a policeman.
He had to search all the way from Ehza-
beth-street to the Town Hall to find one.
Still, little things like that leave the “Daily
Telegraph’s” idol unruffled. The Com-
missioner who could find the Pyjama Girl
killer was certain to find a policeman—
sooner or later.

POLITICAL POINTS
“Remember, remember the Eighth of
November!” Order of precedence in
the “ ‘Labor’ Government” which got its
issue that day:
(1) Cain
(2) Field
(3) Slater
(4) McKenzie
(5) Barry
(6) Stoneham
Cain was re-elected for Northcote and
Barry for Carlton, after Barry had
thrown many votes to the Opposition by
attacking three returned soldiers, one
(Kent Hughes) a p.-0.-w. Field (mem-
ber for Dandenong since 1937) was 3757
ahead of a Liberal three years ago, 2950
behind the Lib.-C.P. vote on November
10. Slater, member for Dundas since
1917, saw a 1945 majority of nearly two
to one (8022 to 4307) converted into a
minority of 1415. McKenzie (Won-
thaggi, since 1927) was 1931 up in 1945,
1922 down on Monday. And with many
votes to be counted, Stoneham’s latest
lead over a C.P. man in Midlands was a
mere 40 (6482 to 6442); it was 2455 in
1945. A more definite casualty was Reid,
the Chairman of Committees, whose 1945
majority of 5724 faded into a minority of
552.
Excluding Ballarat, Bendigo and Gee-
long, 30 of the 65 Assembly seats are
country. On Monday it was by no means
certain that one of the 30 would have a
“Labor” member. That’s how the clumsy
and arrogant Chifleys and Wards and the
less vocal crawlers to Communists and
the unspeakables who, non-warriors
themselves, spit venom at returned
soldiers, Jap p.-0.-w. preferred, have
worked up country feeling against their
mob, and it is much the same everywhere.
After characteristic proceedings during
which the N.S.W. “Labor” majority made
nonsense of the McGirr protest that it
never uses the gag, Cahill’s measures
wiping out 50 Sydney municipalities with-
out reference to the ratepayers and in-
troducing compulsory voting, also with-
out reference to the ratepayers, are ready
for delivery to the Legislative Council.
That Chamber could make a name for
itself by refusing to pass them without a
referendum. The “Labor” Ms.L.C. are
in a minority, and the good-as-“ Labor”
Parry, of Sydney land-sales notoriety, is
not reported back from his mysterious sea
voyage.
A conference of Australian policemen,
sitting at Sydney, turned down a Vic-
torian proposal for “an inquiry into the
activities of Communists,” with a view
to “immediate action.” But the adverse
majority was small, and the secretary of
the Victorian Police Association opened
his heart to the reporters concerning the
menace of “a godless, tyrannical Com-
munist dictatorship”;
As common criminals seek the cover of
darkness, so do Communists, behind false
fronts, carry on their sinister and vicious
programme intent on robbing and swindling
Australians of their freedom and heritage.
There followed the voting in Victoria,
which was obviously influenced by the
feeling against Communists and against
“Labor” politicians who crawl to him.
In Port Melbourne, for one thing, the
Communist vote slumped from 8000 at
the peak to 1000 or so, and the candi-
date —he is “State president” —lost his
deposit.
A Coal Tribunal has given N.S.W.
coalminers a £l-a-week rise in the inno-
cent assumption that it will bring the
country more coal. A sort of Bread
Tribunal awarded Sydney bakers another
15s. a week and promised to hear their
claim for £1 a week. This got them
back to work on Monday after Sydney
and Newcastle had been without bread
for nine days. Housewives, who had
to bake scones and fry pufftaloons and
dig into depleted housekeeping cash for
money to buy the children’s lunches, got
nothing except the certainty that the next
time the bakers strike the process will be
repeated.
Jack Cain, who must have known that
his Government would be defeated, was
dignified in defeat. A lesser man would
have said a lot of bitter things about
the Chifley crowd that brought him down,
but all Cain said was “I accept the
verdict of the people and will do my best
to serve them as leader of the Opposi-
tion.” Chifley, so voluble on other occa-
sions to the press “circus,” had “nothing
to say.”
Chifley won’t be at the Wedding, and
his deputy “can’t find the time.” Mac-
kenzie King, who is just on 73, is already
in London with an invitation to the young
couple to tour Canada.
Australia’s official wedding gift to
Princess Elizabeth, chosen by “Labor,” is
characteristic of that party’s stinginess
and poverty of imagination in matters
other than “Labor” salaries, cars, over-
seas jaunts and expenditure designed to
bring in the greatest number of votes
“two silver cake dishes and two salvers.”
8.C.0.F.’s present, subscribed for by all
ranks in Japan, is “a 150-year-old jewel-
box, a superb example of Japanese gold-
lacquer work, representing the 53 stop-
ping places between Tokyo and Kyoto in
ancient times, the details so fine that when
the box is viewed through a magnifying
glass cherryblossom petals, willow leaves
and stones in the Imperial Palace wall
can be recognised.” But then servicemen,
unlike “Labor” politicians, never do
things by halves.
McEwen, Fadden’s deputy, ordinarily
a serious man with a serious manner,
showed himself no mean humorist when
he discussed the operations of the Com-
monwealth Bank’s mortgage branch, estab-
lished in deference to Wimmera (now
Norfolk Island) Wilson, whose vote was
then all-important. The mortgage branch,
said McEwen, has been operating for
five years. “Last year it attracted a
whole 416 customers”; and “it can’t
raise the alibi that it was trammelled
by a bank board”:
Go to this mortgage branch for a loan
and what happens? You are handed a form
—the inevitable form! —with, on the most
recent count, a hundred and four questions;
and you would have to be a crystal-gazer
to answer some of them. You go away
with your* form and take it to a lawyer.
And the mortgage branch is in with its
bill before the lawyer is ready with his.
Unless the form beats the customer, it
charges him “£5, deposit on valuation fee ;
something the exploiters never thought
of.” And, the 104 questions answered
and delivered, “the customer waits a
long time for a decision.”
What’s ail this about Chifley being a
stern, unbending character? He can be
stubborn when he likes, but it is stubborn-
ness of a quality often found in ladies
of uncertain or too-certain years. He
squibbed on the wage-pegging issue. He
has always squibbed on the Communist
issue. He squibbed on the Victorian elec-
tions and he may squib on the bank issue
if he decides that another retreat is
advisable.
It is just on four years since Federal
“Labor” decided on a referendum to
secure a perpetuation of its war-time
powers, and in the winter of 1944 Dr.
Evatt and his “Labor” and Communist
associates were going about the country
declaring that these powers would disap-
pear in no lime unless written into the
Constitution. Last week Dedman intro-
duced a bill “to provide for a continu-
ance of major economic controls under
the Defence Transitional Act until De-
cember 31, 1948.” The quoted words
are taken from the Sydney “Daily
Mirror,” which, already shaken by the
bank grab, was moved by this latest
manoeuvre of Chifley, Dedman and “the
wily Dr. Evatt” to abandon its good-as-
“Labor” pose—at least for the time
being.
If Chifley has his way the second-
reading debate on the Bank Grab Bill
will end this week. A.B.C.’s million sub-
scribers will scarcely be sorry, and some
of Dr. Evatt’s young men will be glad.
They must be tired of writing speeches,
especially as so many of the speeches are
delivered so badly.
An inordinate number of the questions
fired at Ministers in the House at Can-
berra is addressed to and answered by
Chifley. This is an unnecessary strain on
him, and one to which no British P.M.
would ever submit. But it speaks volumes
for the Opposition’s—and Chifley’s—
opinion of some of Chifley’s lieutenants.
Tasmania’s Legislative Council sent a
resolution for a bank-grab referendum to
the other shop. There it was defeated by
a solitary vote, representing about 200
Assembly ballot-papers, so close was the
1946 election. Premier Cosgrove didn’t
seem happy about the business, but he
had the face to declare that it would be
“disastrous if sections of the present
Banking Act were found to be invalid,
and if the consequent loss of control over
the banking system led to inflation of
credit.” In their own interests the trading
banks wouldn’t inflate credit if they could.
Nothing is further from their desires than
that their advances to clients should be
repaid in depreciated currency. But a
runaway inflation would suit demagogues
who dream of repudiation or, in the alter-
native, of paying off the “bloodsucking
bondholders” in money whose purchas-
ing power has gone to glory.
Differences of opinion among “Friends,
Romans, Countrymen,” as Menzies
would put it:
Langtry (Riverina): The Golden Age is
here, and the Government intends to keep
it here. The Bank Bill will give the Golden
Age to the people.
Minister Dedman: There is no doubt
that a serious post-war boom is taking
place in the international field, and all
the conditions favor an unhealthy boom
in rural land values.
Minister Scully: Whether it comes quickly
or slowly, a depression will come.
“S. M. Herald” was ready with the smart
comment that these people, who haven’t
gumption enough to stick to the same
story, “appear wholly unable to make up
their minds whether they are seeking to
protect the nation against a boom or a
depression.”
Is there anything these Socialists
fasten their clumsy hands on which
doesn’t show a loss? In 1942 the
Commonwealth “Labor” Government
took over a coppermine near Rock-
hampton and worked it for two
years. That was a time when copper was
an urgently-needed commodity, and it’s
been sorely needed ever since. Yet in
the two years the Government chaps were
running the mine they lost £90,000. Try-
ing to run, Coalcliff (N.S.W.) for about
the same period they lost £lOB,OOO and
45,000 tons of coal. No wonder they
won’t, tell anybody how their T.A.A. air-
line is making out.
Queensland “Labor” has slapped a tax
on gross earnings of all airlines flying in
Queensland. Air-freights and fares have
gone up 10 p.c. N.S.W. “Labor” pro-
poses to slap on a similar tax in its terri-
tory. Are these taxes designed to pro-
vide landing grounds, navigational or
other aids to flying? Not a bit of it.
Their sole purpose is to grab money from
the airlines and hand it over to their rail-
ways to make them look less insolvent
than they are.
“Labor” members profess to believe
that customers of the trading banks are
signing anti-grab petitions under duress.
In a letter to a bank manager Pollard
suggested that the people the man-
ager had interviewed were probably
under the bank’s thumb because they had
overdrafts and could not express their
real views. But aren’t those the poor
folk “Labor” is out to save from the
clutches of tha bankers? If the
private banks threaten them can’t they
go round the corner to the Common-
wealth Bank for succor? And, anyway,
why not give them a chance to show the
banks their real views—at a referendum?
A far better means of storing the wheat
than the Pollard-Perrett notion of heap-
ing it up in the paddocks to await the
problematical arrival of bags would be
for Perrett or Pollard to go round buying
up all the empty hotel-cellars. These
could be cut into three-bushel containers
to plans drawn up by the planners of
Dedman’s department and provided with
patent fasteners by Holloway’s depart-
ment. At the worst this would keep the
Pollards and Perretts out of the road
while practical people handled the
harvest.
Thumbnail biographies from Who's
Who in Australia, condensed:
Adair Macalister Blain, b. N.S.W. Nov.
21, 1894. A.I.F. 1915-19, 32nd Bn.;
wounded. A.I.F. 1940; served Bth Div.
Malaya, p.-0.-w. Feb., 1942, to Aug.,
1945, in Changi, Sandakan, Outram Road
prisons.
Daniel Mulcahy, b. Jan. 7, 1882, Mill-
town, Ireland. Alderman Waterloo (Syd.)
Council for eight years; mayor 1922-30;
when elected to Federal Parliament sat
under J. A. Beaslejh re-elected in 1940 as
member non-Communist Labor party.
Of an age to serve in the First World
War, Mulcahy (imp.) remained behind his
beer pump. That didn’t prevent him
hurling foul insults at Blain, the good
Australian who, wounded in World War
I, went through the tortures of the
damned in World War 11.
Last Friday, while thousands of vol-
unteers in city streets were selling
Flanders poppies for Remembrance,
Daniel Mulcahy was repeating in the
House foul slanders he had made the
previous day against Blain, M.H.R. In
slandering Blain, a Digger of two wars,
Mulcahy slandered the many thousands
'of Good Australians to whom Remem-
brance Day is sacred. His majority in
Lang (N.S.W.) was heavily reduced last
year and it will disappear next time, if
he has a next time.
On the matter of the future of private-
bank employees if and when the Grab
becomes effective it’s a case of so many
men so many voices. First the brick-
dropping Dedman spoke of 5000 surplus
employees. Then P.M.G. Cameron
weighed in blithely with an offer to absorb
into his department the surplus chaps
who weren’t going to be surplus. Now
Drakeford, taking off time from ruling
the air, promises that when the banks
are nationalised there will be such an ex-
pansion of business that all the present
staffs will be absorbed and there will be
opportunities of promotion for all. And
Drakeford should know. His T.A.A.,
still an infant, supports a staff big enough
to run an interplanetary rocket-ship ser-
vice, and the losses are such that Drake-
ford won’t even hint at them.
“The P.M.G., at the opening of the
Postal and Telegraph Association con-
ference here yesterday, said the time for
large profits in the Postal Department
was past The Government had with-
drawn the 12 i per cent, surcharge on
telephone accounts and halfpenny on
letter postage The record profit made
in 1945-46 will be reduced to something
less than £1,000,000....” When did
Senator Cameron say that? He didn’t.
It was the South African P.M.G.
speaking.
From “Yarrasider”:
Barry, who hates returned-soldier opponents
so much (B. 5/11/ ’47), likes walking in forests,
according to Who s Who. It is most regrettable
that such a nature-lover should have missed
the chance of his life to go forest-strolling m
foreign parts. If he had joined the A.I.F. he
would have been with many men not so old.
Whether these doughty battlers joined up
to walk in forests I don’t know —any walking
usually seemed to make them sweat and swear
terribly—but they certainly walked in plenty
of them. Take the olive groves of Crete. Acres
and acres of serene forest loveliness that would
undoubtedly have delighted Barry; sylvan
gloom with soft light filtering through the
delicate foliage; the silence undisturbed except
for the plane’s roar, the bomb’s scream and
the tommygun’s rattle. Later on, in New
Guinea, Barry could have tackled forests never
before trodden by white men. He could have
tramped these forests for months, for years,
and been paid for doing it. But it’s too late
now.

"AND IT'S PRINTED
WITH WIMBLES INKS"
“Jasby”: Shades of all the Diggers,
sailors and shearers who ever called a
cook a blankard of expressed curiosity as
to who called the blankard a cook must
have risen up in protest last week when a
Canberra typist was declared “black” by
the staff of a hostel for expressing her
opinion of the food and the chef who
prepared it. According to Mr. Menzies the
girl complained that “the soup was cold
and the other food half-cooked.” The
waitress told the cook and the cook told
somebody else, with the result that the
typist was visited by “a union official and
a representative of the Department of the
Interior” and told that no further meals
would be served to her and that her
appearance in the dining-room would be
the signal for a strike. The Minister for
the Interior’s version was that “the cook
had demanded an apology for the insult
that he was not fit to cook for pigs.” The
Minister supported the cook’s stand, say-
ing “he would not have been worth his
salt if he had been prepared to take the
insult,” and in a letter to the hostel’s
house committee claimed that the typist
had agreed to apologise. Passing up the
opportunity of telling the chef that he
was fit to cook for pigs, tflte young woman
denied any intention of apologising and
the house committee supported her. She
was transferred to another hostel after
ten days under the black ban. Remarks
similar to those of the Canberra typist
are made in boarding-houses all over the
globe every day; they produce as a rule
a continuance of cold soup and half-
cooked food. Only in Canberra, where a
disgruntled unionist can always rely on
the support of a Minister backed with the
whole strength of “Labor,” pledged to
the policy of “the worker is always right,”
could it result in such a flagrant example
of victimisation, as ridiculous as it is
cowardly.

“K.”: One distressing consequence of
the panic-stricken flight of Indian com-
munities has been averted. Among the
mass of Moslem refugees that fled for
Pakistan were 20 mahouts employed by
the Maharajah of Patiala. The effect on
the State elephants was disastrous, for the
drivers and their forebears had tended the
State elephant stables for generations.
The animals refused food or water from
any other hands, and after five days, when
their case was desperate, the Maharajah
ordered refugee camps to be combed for
the mahouts. They were found, brought
back post-haste, and the elephants, wel-
coming them with loud trumpetings,
abandoned their fast. The oldest of the
elephants and his mahout are about the
same age—6s.
* * * *
“Shirley”: Holidaying in Sydney, we
went into a really posh restaurant. An
obsequious waiter showed us to a table,
took our order and departed, leaving a
door to the service quarters ajar. Through
it I had a clear view of the back entrance.
A bread-cart drew up outside, a baker
alighted, lifted a chaff bag from the cart,
bumped into a passer-by and a shower
of bread-rolls flew in ail directions. He
quickly picked them up, dusting a few
off on his apron before replacing them in
the bag. “Bake-oh!” he called, and tipped
the load on to the kitchen floor. Our
waiter shovelled up half a dozen or so
on to a tray, and a few minutes later he
was at our table, where, taking a pair
of tongs, he carefully lifted a roll on to
each of our plates.

“S.T.S.”: Adelaide has municipal golf
links laid out on the parklands behind
the Oval; and a woman walking there
has been awarded £79 against a doctor
whose ball hit her in the mouth. The
Judge found that (1) The links were so
laid out that from any tee to the appro-
priate hole the drive does not cross a
path ; (2) the doctor had hooked his ball
across a path; (3) before playing back
he had called “fore” as warning, but
had not “become aware that the warn-
ing was appreciated”; (4) the lady’s
negligence, if any, was not the cause of
her damage—which means false teeth.
* * * *
‘‘Strap”; Anketell” (B. 8/10/’47) diag-
noses expertly the effects of “music while
you work.” In the huge machine-shop
where I made my “war effort” two
mighty dynamos droned all through the
night-shift on notes half a semitone apart.
The discord was excruciating. Above the
agony could be heard the music of the
radio. For months’ six records were re-
peated at half-hour intervals without any
change of programme. One record had
a syncopated note for which we
“Thank heaven that debt’s paid!”
all waited. When it arrived we struck in
perfect unison with hammer or spanner
the noisiest object on hand. As the weeks
passed the blows grew harder, until the
tune had to be banned. Dynamos, rivet-
ing machines and screaming drills made a
cacophonous accompaniment to worn-out
records. Ruskin admired the man who
whistled at his work. I wonder what he
would have thought of our modern idea
of lightening toil?
*** * *
“Nakh”: A year or so ago there was
a discussion in these pages on the reason
for the extraordinary angles at which the
trees leaned in Nicholson-street, Mel-
bourne, hard by St. Patrick’s Cathedral.
The mystery is now beyond solution, the
City Council having sallied out with an
axe at the dead of night and chopped the
lot down to make way for a parking area
for trucks and Lizzies. The quaint street
has always been a centre of interest for
lovers of beauty, and has inspired several
artists —Gayfield Shaw labelled an etch-
ing “The Street of Leaning Trees” —and
only an alderman could prefer the present
appearance of the thoroughfare to Shaw’s
picture. Destroying the thing they love,
or should love, seems to be a law with
City Fathers.

“Mac”: I once had reason to be grate-
ful for W.A.’s free-and-easy railways. In
Perth for the day, three friends and 1
wanted to get back to Chidlow’s Well
that night. We noted the time of our
train and took care to be half-an-hour
early. Our bad luck: the train had left
a,n hour before time. “Look,” we said
to the stationmaster, “we’ve just got to
get back to Chidlow tonight. It’s urgent.”
“See what I can do for you,” said the
stationmaster. He had a word with the
driver of an engine that was shunting
near by, and all three disappeared down
the line. Five minutes later they were
back with a carriage coupled to the»
engine. "Hop in,” said the driver. On
we hopped, said “Thank you” to the
s.m., and were taken back to Chidlow in
our Special.
“Beecham”: Boulder trains (B.
l/10/’47) have nothing on the Marble
Bar service. Was at Pippingarra siding,
12 miles from Port Hedland, when the
train pulled in. A passenger strode up
to the driver. “Lost me shirt back along
the line,” he complained. “Was shakin’
the dust out of it when it flew out the
window.” “How far back?” asked the
driver. “About eight miles.” The train
backed away. It came through again
some time later and the passenger, who
had been in pants and singlet before, was
now sporting a colored shirt.
* * * *
“Roxite”: Tell “Youanmi” the she-
wolf inhabited pickle factories 15 years
ago, when a whole corridor carriage on
a Sydney suburban train was permanently
reserved for the nightly home journey of a
gang of female packers through the simple
expedient of downing, de-bagging and
ejecting any male who happened to enter.
As the victim bolted down the platform
seeking privacy to reclothe the ladies sent
a long-drawn whistling howl after him
that would have done credit to a Satur
day-night Stadium crowd greeting first
blood in a prelim.
* * * *
“Curate’s Egg”: The emotion displayed
by “Zake” (B. 8/TO/’47) on finding a
pipe in his loaf of bread recalls the scene
in a G.D.D. officers’ mess when the
colonel observed a similar weapon amid
his mushroom fricassee. The old man,
who had surrounded half his portion
prior to the discovery, retired precipi-
tately and was joined by several other
squeamish souls who had chosen the same
menu item. Only the psychology officer
finished his mushrooms with perfect
aplomb. Afterwards he explained: “It
cost me only three shillings for a new
pipe at the canteen to convince the
colonel that there’s something in this
psychology business.” Then we recalled
that the colonel had on the previous even-
ing described psychology as “absolute
balderdash.”

“R.W.”: Cholera? Just after the end
of the war two girls from our medical-
unit orderly-room received orders to pro-
ceed to the A.G.H. at Rabaul. The C.O.
sent word to prepare the necessary tray,
and he would attend to the girls’ anti-
cholera injections himself. My co-
apothecary, a somewhat sadistic gent.,
prepared the tray. Instead of the or-
dinary hypodermic needles and syringes
he put on the largest syringe he could
find, as well as two fearsome needles as
long as a pencil and about half as thick.
He took the tray into the O.R. and said
to one of the girls “Here you are, ser-
geant ; take this over to the C.O. and he’ll
give you your injections now.” The two
girls looked at the tray, then at each other
and burst into tears. The C. 0., a good
sort of cove, had the real tray in his
office.
“Gravelsnatcher”: Darwin’s cholera
scare recalls a panic which swept W.A.
50 years ago when a case, landed at Fre-
mantle from a nor’-west port, was diag-
nosed as bubonic plague. A frenzied
attempt to round up all the disembarked
passengers was only partly successful, and
the official concern for the living was
submerged in the greater and more urgent
problem of the disposal of the dead.
Ordinary burial was ruled out, and cre-
mation was either unethical or considered
inadequate. Finally the corpse was taken
out in a launch and consigned to the
deep—and for months afterwards Perth
people wouldn’t eat fish.'
* * * «
“Sixenate”: A legal friend finds it “put
up to him” to do some queer chores for
his clients. An application for bail having
failed, he was asked by a coarse brute
who was “up” for murderous assault on
his missus to gather a voice-recording
from a record-making studio and have it
sent out to his battered lady. The beauti-
fully bathetic notion of having his rau-
cous voice sound-recorded in a “rendi-
tion” of “The Prisoner’s Song” had come
to the client during the brief interlude
between the final wife-bashing and his
arrest; it would enable the lady to hear
her spouse singing sobfully “Oh, I wish
I had someone to love me, Someone
to call me her own.” Here was a touch
calculated to make a woman forget her
long years of battering and ill-treatment.
But it didn’t work, and the troubadour
is now doing his time. His last remark
to his lawyer was that some women are
as stony-’earted as the prison itself.
* * * *
“Bob”: The laziness of motorists
seems to be a widespread failing, “Ebor”
(B. 15/1 /’47). During a stay in northern
South Australia I was often a passenger
on one of the main mail routes, and on
one occasion a strong wind left a sheet
of galvanised iron on the track. Every-
body drove around it. When the iron
was eventually moved, by another wind,
the new track remained. Present-day in-
habitants probably wonder about the
seemingly unwarranted curve on a good
flat road.
m * * *
“Brolga”: Beer issue (B. 1 /10/ ’47)?
I’ll never forget one issue that really was
an issue. In July, ’43, a big Seven-
Divvy manoeuvre on the Tableland was to
culminate in a well-organised break at
Mt. Garnet, where a rodeo and race-
meeting had been planned. Part of
the festivities was to be a beer issue of
two bottles a man each day. Within
sight of the Garnet, our throats parched
after several days of footslogging through
the dusty scrub, my unit was picked up
by M.T. and whisked back to camp to
pack up in preparation for an immediate
embarkation. Packing completed and
the camp-site cleaned up, we were told
that although we’d missed the fun we
would still have our beer. Trucks laden
with cases pulled into camp: four bottles
each all round. At 1 a.m. the unit was
somehow stowed on the trucks for the
trip to the coast. When daylight came
and the convoy halted half-way down
the range there were more assorted head-
aches and black eyes than the unit had
ever had. My C.S.M., a hefty footballer,
looked as if he’d been manhandled by
Joe Louis. The sergeant tailor, a very
mild and inoffensive little chap, had been
responsible.
* * * *
“Findy”: If you’re travelling to Can-
berra by road watch out for this one. You
see a car pulled up by the roadside with
two women waving. You stop, to find they
are gipsies. Have you passed a black
sedan during the last few miles? You
haven’t. They look distressed; their
friends were in it and should have over-
taken them by this time. You repeat that
you have not seen a black sedan. They
thank you for stopping, bless your car
and wish you a good journey. You pre-
pare to move on. If you’ve got any sense
you will move on, immediately. If you
linger you’re sunk. Your palm will be
read while you sit shamefacedly think-
ing what an idiot you are to fall for such
an old trap. Presently one of the gipsies
will be holding in her grubby palm some
of your money, maybe only sixpence,
maybe a note; it depends on the degree
of your generosity, credulousness or
weakness of will —but she’ll be holding
something and saying “Does this gift
come to me from an open heart, because
the gift that does not come from an open
heart cannot bring any good to the re-
ceiver?” You’ll mumble “Yes” and drive
on, ashamed at being a sucker, while the
two harpies go back to their car and wait
for the next mug. A variant of the black-
sedan trick is to ask for a little petrol,
or even a match. Few motorists will
ignore the spectacle of women in distress,
but once you’ve answered the questions
of these roadside gold-diggers there s
only one thing to do. As soon as they
start blessing your car —“Good-bye, sister.
I’m on my way.”
« * * •
“O’Yen”: A variation of the “fast-
unto-death” technique of Gandhi and
the more familiar, simpler, but less severe
methods of our own “workers” has been
devised by the Oriental mind. Employees
of the Central Bank of China are work-
ing until exhausted as a protest against
cutting of salaries while increases in the
price index are recorded. This action
followed an unsuccessful hunger strike
which, according to a spokesman, made
the men “starved and uneasy.”
PROFITS.
“Speaking on the Bank Bill, Mr. McDonald (Lib.,
Vic.) said he was tired of sneers at profit-making.
How many people would be working today if they
did not make a profit from working?”
A point that strikes me as well worth the taking,
An apt interrogation, this, to spring,
On those who loudly sneer at profit-making
As being an objectionable thing.
Whether it’s brewing, butchering or baking,
Helping to run a bank or harvesting.
How many would be occupied today
But for their firm resolve to make it pay?
How many, in whatever rank or station,
Whether the sturdy shearer or the boss,
Wouldn’t prefer a gainful occupation
To any that involves a risk of loss.
Or feel inclined to view accumulation
Of healthy dividends as merely dross?
In short, how many altruists would you meet
In any casual stroll along the street?
Profits to be condemned! It moves one’s
laughter
To hear them scheduled as a cause for blame,
For who the blithering blazes isn’t*' after,
Whether in banks or factories, the same?
They link the humblest laborer or grafter
With those who play the Parliamentary game—
Though obviously in the latter biz
Their opportunities are more than his.
Profits! How fatuous to scorn and scout them,
When all that’s worth achieving they pro-
mote!
I wonder where we’d find ourselves without
them,
My literary brothers. Let me quote
The dictum Doctor Johnson wrote about them,
That no one but a blockhead . ever wrote
Except for gain. A view, you may infer,
With which both “Bellerive” and myself concur.
N.S.W,
IFORD.


“Melbn”: Although every Melburnian
secretly believes the Cup is the brightest
jewel in the State’s crown of glory —inci-
dentally, reverent throngs passed through
the National Gallery on Cup morning,
casting a cursory glance at the Rembrandt
self-portrait and the Aphrodite, to gaze
with awe at the stuffed cadaver of Phar
Lap in the Museum —there was no cere-
mony about it. No leading bookmaker
flanked by two jockeys marched up to the
glass case and placed a wreath before it.
There was no march of 20,000 punters
through the city with the girls emptying
bales of torn betting-tickets on their de-
voted heads from ttie tops of buildings.
Pubs, theatres and cinemas carried on
their sacrilegious business, and counter-
attractions were permitted outdoors. In
U.S. they are different. A religious ser-
vice, bugle-calls and the observance of a
minute’s silence on all courses through-
out the country were associated with the
burial of Man o’ War.
“Plop”: The Cup had been run, and
I was feeling glum. There were plenty
like me on the same tram, a company
that would have mildewed the Wailing
Wall. Through the noise came two
voices whose owners evidently did know
something about noddies: “Oh, well,”
said one, “in the wet anything can
happen. Look at the time —two minutes
twenty-eight. Slowest since Colonus’s
in forty-two.” “Thinking it over,” replied
the other, “Proctor really couldn’t have
done it. Not on that track with nine
stone. I’m glad the grey won. He de-
served it.” Looking around for a view
of the experts I beheld two schoolgirls,
pigtail age.
* * * *
“Clooter”: Two or three miles up in
the hills a big dam is being built, and
down to the town at the week-end come
the workers, among them a group of
no-hopers who get boozed on cheap
wine stiffened with metho, and who make
the place hideofTs with brawls, bad lan-
guage and drunken frames. “They,” re-
marked an engineer, “are the new nav-
vies. They are the only type of man
you can get for heavy work like puddling,
rock-heaving, clay-digging and so forth,
these days. Other men won’t take it on
because they can get easy work at higher
pay. If we didn’t endure these chaps—
and they frequently stay away for a
week on the plonk and want another
week to recover —we couldn’t get the
dirty work done. They’re scared of
nothing, from the police to the sack.
There’s a bunch of a dozen or so up at
the dam. Been drunk for days. They
were sacked a week ago, but haven’t
sobered up sufficiently to be told about it,
and by then we’ll want them back.” He
shook his head mournfully and added
“The old navvy is gone. He was a toiler
and proud of it. He could drink, too,
but usually he never drank in working
hours and he was seldom offensive in his
habits. No, the old navvy wouldn’t have
associated with these chaps —still, some-
body has to do the work. What’s yours?”
* * * *
“Pitt St.”: Although its hinterland is
carrying an enormous wheat crop and
there is more flour in mills and stores
than ever before, Australia’s greatest city
awoke last Monday to find itself bread-
less, the blokes who bake the stuff having
decided on a strike. For the rest of the
week the city’s \\ million people, to-
gether with the 150,000 or so around
Newcastle, went without bread. The
scenes in sandwich shops, where flappers
and office boys gather in the lunch-hour,
were dreadful as the customers mourn-
fully bought biscuits and week-old cakes.
In cafes there were bigger crowds than
ever, since confirmed sandwich-eaters
had to fall back on the meat-pie and
hamburger. In the homes harried house-
wives baked scones for the children to
take to school, usually with the gas feel-
ing the strain and the butter ration giving
out. Meantime, union “executives,” em-
ployers’ “representatives” and concilia-
tion “authorities” held conferences and
“ Now, as I belt him, lean back !”
issued frequent statements, what time a
deep silence came from the “Labor”
Government, which claims to be so con-
cerned about the people’s food. But
strangest and most depressing of all was
the fact that the citizens took it with
hardly a murmur. About the only
organised yelp came from the coalminers,
which threatened to stop work unless
they got bread —though how a modern
bakery can bake without gas or elec-
tricity got from coal is another of those
mysteries. In the midst of all this it was
publicly announced that there was a glut
of nannygai; but since the Government
controls fish only irrepressible optimists
tried to buy it; and they were quickly dis-
illusioned.

' “L.P.”: Perusing a list of candidates
seeking election to the council of an ex-
servicemen’s organisation, I was im-
pressed by the varied callings and quali-
fications. There were professional men,
tradesmen, businessmen, farmers and civil
servants —and there was one who made
me scratch my head and wonder. His
occupation? “Retired Justice of Peace.”

“Penelope’s Mate”: It will be hard
for some Australians to adapt themselves
to the added leisure of the 40-hour week,
especially if it means no work on Satur-
day morning. My routine now goes like
this. I abandon bed a half-hour earlier
than usual —you can’t sleep-in Saturday
mornings ; the wife has too much work
to do. After the dishes are done I journey
“Half a jiff, Daphne, while I put some Tarzans Crip on mine!”
to the shops for week-end supplies.
Nearly all the shoppers are no-Saturday-
work males, complete with string-bags,
lists, purses and the harried looks of
women considering purchases. I was first
welcomed to the ranks with appropriate
banter and sneers. Back home the fiist
morning, I took the morning papers to
the back steps. I sat on them until the
spuds were peeled and the peas shelled.
“It’s lovely having you home, dear,” my
wife said. Realising that it was safer to
make an early assault on the garden, I got
out tools and laid on. The New Leisure
will mean a Golden Age for Australian
gardens. Mine is a picture already. On the
other hand my workmate bemoans the
fact that he now has to spend all Satur-
day in the pub. We used to knock off on
week-nights at 5.30; now it’s six. Then
he had time for two pots every evening,
finishing the week with Saturday after-
noon in the parlor with radio, beer and
s.p. Now he gets no time for beer on
week-nights, so makes up for lost time on
Saturday. The extra leisure goes to Bung.

“Uco”; Forgotten identity ' (B.
5/11 /’47)? Saw a case once in a
northern staging camp.. One of our ser-
geants, whose memory was not so hot
at the best of times, was deputed to call
the roll. He had been in Townsville on
the scoot the night before, so that didn’t
help things. Still, he struggled through
the job all right till he got down among
the “w’s.” “Sergeant Watts,” he called.
No reply. “Sergeant Watts,” a little
louder. Still no reply. He glared at the
assemblage and yelled “SERGEANT
WATTS”; then, as a couple of cogs
meshed together in his brain: “Oh, hell,
that’s me.”
* * * *
“Macnell”; Though threatened with
reduction to a token force, the Royal
Navy still builds the , finest ships
afloat. Recently commissioned at
Portland, Weapon-class destroyer Scor-
pion embodies all the modifications
gained through six years’ war ex-
perience. Rating 2000 tons, her power-
packed hull mounts 40,000 horsepower,
a speed of nearly 40 knots and the latest
in automatic quickfirers, plus a viper’s
nest of gyro-stabilised Bofors aft. Her
radar sets can range on a veil of rain,
and the guns automatically follow their
electronic eyes. An innovation is the
placing of the for’ard funnel, which
shoots up inside the trellis of the lattice-
work foremast, with its top bent at an
angle of 90 degrees to the stern to clear
the main gunnery director and bridge of
smoke. Another thin stick of a funnel
juts up amidships. With radar- and gun-
nery-control instruments well-nigh per-
fectly co-ordinated, making hits a mathe-
matical certainty, more powerful depth
charges and omniscient Asdic, and with
vastly-improved living quarters. Scorpion
makes the destroyers built at the be-
ginning of the war, staunch though they
were, seem coracles by comparison.

“F.S.”: A Dutch court of justice is
at present considering what punishment
to inflict on Hans van Meegeren, the
artist who faked not one but six Ver-
meers and sold them for prices up to a
■million guilders after a raft of experts
had declared them genuine Vermeers.
One of the masterpieces was bought by
Goring for a quarter of a million, and
others were sold to leading galleries and
institutions; the fraud was only dis-
covered when the perpetrator confessed.
Van Meegeren told the Court that he per-
petrated the forgeries “for art’s sake, not
to make millions,” as he wanted to show
up the people he considered the enemies
of art, namely the art appreciators,
critics and experts who know all about it
though they can’t paint a picture. He
succeeded so well that some of the ex-
perts still maintain that if the pictures
weren’t painted by Vermeer they were
painted by a man as great as Vermeer.
In a police test he was allowed to paint
still another “Vermeer” and again satis-
fied the experts. The real question is
whether it would have satisfied Vermeer.

“Flathead”: After an unsuccessful
attempt to tickle a centipede my neigh-
bors’ little girl informed her grandmother
that she had a sore finger. From her
stock of good old remedies Grandma
prescribed bed with foments to follow,
and although the child obediently hit the
hay she was dubious about the hot-water
treatment. She was a stoic though, and
didn’t bat an eyelid while her finger was
treated. Later, when it had been band-
aged, the lass’s conscience seized her:
“Granny. That really wasn’t my sore
finger. I just wanted to see if you hurt.”

“Breff H.”: If “Coongan” is interested
in quaint newspaper posters (B.
22/10/’47) he might like to add this to
his collection. Melbourne “Sun” pro-
duced it:
MEAT SITUATION IMPROVES.

“Earl”; A small boy who recently fell
asleep in a Sydney theatre told a pathetic
story —he didn’t mind so much awaking,
locked in, long after midnight, but was
highly indignant at having missed the pic-
ture. I appreciate his feelings. Years
ago a friend and I went to a theatre
especially to see newsreels of a Test
match. For some unaccountable reason
—we blamed the prawns —weariness des-
cended on us soon after we settled down.
I nodded back to consciousness to find an
usherette shaking me and threatening
terrible things unless my friend ceased
his snoring. X promised there would be
no further interruptions, proddec my
friend severely and admonished hirv and
stared once more at the screen. When
I next awoke the show was over, rha
audience gone and the cleaners were dis-
cussing in loud tones the habits of drunks
who go into picture-theatres to sleep it off.

“Bo”: With a snooty air and an ex-
pression of intense dissatisfaction the
well-upholstered dowager looked over the
wares of the kerbside barrowman. She
broke open a couple of pea-pods, moved
along to the bean compartment, and after
a few abortive attempts succeeded in
snapping one. Thence to the tomatoes,
a couple of which she tested with a
pudgy hand. As she picked up a lettuce,
turned it over and began squeezing it the
barrowman, who had been eyeing her
movements since she began, broke off his
ritual and addressed her. “Missus,” he
said gently. “I don’t mind y’ openin’ a few
of the pods to give the poor peas a bit o’
fresh air; I got no objection to y’ frac-
turin’ a bean or takin’ the pulse of a few
o’ me tomatoes; but for ’Eaven’s sake
don’t squeeze that there pet lettuce o’
mine too ’ard, will y’? It’s got a weak
’eart!”
“Strop”: “Bo” (B. 22/10/’47) has suf-
fered at amateur concerts from the re-
ceiving end. What about the performers?
I was billed to play Handel’s “Largo”
to an accompaniment provided by the
star dance-player of the district, re-
puted to be able to read anything
at sight. Off we went, the fiddle at
the slowest tempo ever set by any com-
poser, the piano at jig-time. I refused
to be hustled ; the lady had the bit be-
tween her teeth, with the result that I
was left at the post and covered most
of the distance on my own. The audi-
ence took it for granted that I was only
a learner and couldn’t make the pace.
On the same programme was a Shaks-
pearean recitation, and I was roped in
as prompter. The piece was Othello s
last speech, but it must have sounded
like a dialogue until the end, when the
elocutionist tore his passion to tatters,
stabbed himself with an imaginary dagger,
and shouted “Exeunt Omnes” with his last
breath.
BLOKES AND GUYS.
You often hear the Yanks and we
Are bound by ties of speech,
The very same vocab’lary
Serving the needs of each.
Both speak the tongue that Shakspeare spoke
And Milton did —or try ;
The only thing that puzzles folk
Like me is what we call a “bloke’
They designate a “guy.”
They mean the same to them as us,
The diff’rent words we’ve wove,
Colloquially synonymous
With “fellow,” “chap” or “cove. ’
They’re not the sort of terms whereby
Our leaders we invoke,
But to the crowd, the common fry,
Truman, I’ll bet, remains a guy,
And Bill McKell a bloke.
A man’s a man, which should be full
As clear as language can
Convey to either Johnny Bull
Or Cousin Jonathan.
But in the land of elm and oak,
Wattle and gum forbye,
You’ll note that he becomes a bloke,
But where the dollar holds the yoke
His title is a guy.
You cannot always tell apart
Types of a ditfrent race
Forgathering for heart-to-heart
Talks in some public place.
But whensoe’er you visualise
Chaps over drinks and smokes
Cementing Anglo-Yankee ties .
Then you may readily surmise
Some of the company are guys—
And those who’re not are blokes.

THE SERVICE MAN
Sandakcm and Slander.
“Ek Dum”: One of the most dis-
graceful attacks on a prisoner-of-war by
a “Labor” politician—not the first —was
made by Mr. Mulcahy, member for
Lang— not an Australian by birth and
with no military record—on Mr. A. M.
Blain, member for the Northern Terri-
tory,
Mr. Mulcahy, speaking on the Banking
Bill, dragged in the affairs of a dead
Digger and made them a subject of con-
troversy, as had been done by several
“Labor” members previously. Mr. Blain
asked where the Digger was. Mr. Mul-
cahy replied: “I hope he is in Heaven.”
Mr. Blain said “It is like you to men-
tion the name of a man who is dead.
Shame on you,” adding “De mortuis nil
nisi banum.” To which Mr. Mulcahy
replied: “Unlike the member for the
Northern Territory, he did not show
his gold pass to the Japanese to get
special treatment.”
Mr. Blain called Mr. Mulcahy a
“dirty mongrel,” and, however unpar-
liamentary the expression may have been,
most soldiers would be inclined to sym-
pathise with his feelings.
Mr. Mulcahy on the following day
refused to apologise when his victim
asked that a Committee of Privileges
should inquire into his behavior while
“Phew, Skipper, those mothballs hum a bit!”
a p.-0.-w., adding that if his traducer
could not prove his inferences he “should
be expelled from this Parliament as unfit
to associate with decent men.”
Mr. Mulcahy’s response was: —
I stated that Lieutenant Wilkins did not
show his pass to the enemy to get any
privilege. Mr. Blain said he showed his
pass to save his life and that was a great
privilege....! have the greatest admiration
for those who suffered in the Army and as
p.-0.-w., but since I came to this House,
and since Mr. Blain came here, the Labor
party has been very generous to him be-
cause of his low mentality.
A. M. Blain is a qualified surveyor,
formerly Acting Chief Surveyor of the
J _ .r* . c
Northern Territory. A surveyor 01 low
mentality” would be a curiosity, though
low mentalities have been recognisable
behind beer pumps. Mr. Blain enlisted
for service in World War I at 19 years of
aee He served the period of the war
. 6 . c . „ 7„ n „i 1
in the infantry, was wounded twice and
gassed. He was in several big battles,
including Pozieres.

When World War II arrived he was
several years over age for service and
a member of Parliament. He was the
only member of the Federal House to
enlist in the ranks. Sent to Singapore
in January, 1942, he went straight
to the front line and was promoted on
the field to the rank of sergeant as the
result of his conduct under fire. He
was taken prisoner and sent to the San-
dakan camp in Borneo, from which
fewer than 40 men all told (apart from
officers removed to Kuching) survived
out of 2500, Of these all but six were
prisoners under sentence for attempted
escapes, t
The Official Report
The official report of the activities
of “B” Force (p.-0.-w.), which arrived
at Sandakan on July 18, 1942, says:
In April, 1943, Sgt. A. M. ©lain, M.P.,
2/12 Fd. Coy., R.A.E., with S/Sgt. James,
27 Dental Unit, contacted Lieutenant Wells
with a proposal to escape and asked for
assistance. Mr. Blain stated that Major
Flemming had agreed for him to attempt
to get home and bring back medical assist-
ance. We were reluctant to assist him at
the time because of difficulties within the
organisation. Blain sent a note to Dr.
Taylor [through the Jap lines], through
Driver Scott... .enclosing his Parliamentary
gold pass [ i.e as a token of good faith],
which Taylor returned, telling Blain to wait.
He then contacted S/Sgt. James. They
took Blain’s gold pass to show Chin Pain
to impress upon him the impor-
tance of helping Blain to escape. Nothing
further eventuated with his escape, as the
natives told him to wait. Later on, while
Wallace was still at large, James and Martin
took a note [i.e., from Blain] to Chin Pain
Chang addressed to Mr. Forde.
This note was brought to Australia by
the escaping prisoner, Wallace.
It is obvious that every time Blain
allowed his pass to be used he showed a
coldblooded and careless courage. Had
it been found on Chin Pain Chang, or
the messenger who carried it, both
he and Blain would have been beheaded
without doubt. The member for the
Northern Territory used it freely in the
interests of the camp, as a badge of
authority and good faith.
The Arrests
Through the treachery of an Indian
mender on the aerodrome, various mem-
bers of the escape and succor parties
were presently unmasked. The Japan-
ese began making arrests, beating and
torturing those who were arrested. Thus
a man named Joo Ming—afterwards
executed-under severe torture men-
tioned the name of Signalman Frank
Martin as having been associated
with the escape attempt of Blain and
r Martin Rlain and Tames were
James. Martin, Blam and James were
arrested.
What happened to them and Other
prisoners is told in the official report:
4 , , . ■ . , L
The methods of extracting information
were by brutal methods of torture, one of
the worst being compelling one to consume
raw nee, followed by large draughts ot
water, with a consequent painful swelling
of the stomach Handcuffing and tying
to g* fflf.
floggings with European riding whips and
Japanese wooden swords were very fre-
fluently used on all prisoners. Signalman
Martin received a particularly heavy beat-
jn g over contacts with natives in con-
nection with Blain’s proposed escape. Con-
tinual cries were heard from natives in the
interrogation room all day. Burning with
cigarettes was a torture used on serious
p.-0.-w. cases,
The “Gold Medal”
During these proceedings a native told
the Japanese that Blain was using a gold
medal as a badge of authority. Japanese
officers in certain special secret categories
carried medallion identification badges,
and according to Lieutenant Wells (Eighth
Div. Sigs.), the senior surviving officer of
those arrested, the Japanese suspected
that Blain’s badge was a secret-service
badge. He produced it to save his life,
Later, according to Cpl. Rickards, 2/3
M.A.C., he showed it to the Japanese
when he was trying to get medical sup-
plies, not for himself, but for men dying
in hospital,

figure in the daring task of establishing
wireless in Sandakan Camp and who was
himself arrested, tortured and imprisoned,
said:
Blain was a brave man. The Japanese
knew from the start that he was a member
of Parliament, and h£ took a lot of bashing
because of it. They delighted in beating up
an important man.
Lieut. Wells, the senior surviving
officer arrested at Sandakan for the
escape attempts (Captain Matthews hav-
ing been beheaded), who was sentenced
to 12 years’ penal servitude by the
Japanese, said:
Mr. Blain was a splendid soldier and his
conduct as a prisoner-of-war was beyond
reproach.
Outram Road Jail
Blain and his companions were taken
to Kuching and there tried on February
3, 1944. They were luckier than some
of their mates, thanks to the firmness of
native witnesses. They were, however,
sent like monkeys behind bars in cages
in a horrible little transport to Singapore
to serve a jail sentence at Outram Jail.
There, for 14 months, Blain sat upright
on a board from 7.30 a.m. till 9.30 p.m.
daily in a cell. During that period he did
not see the stars.
The regulations required prisoners dur-
ing these 14 hours per day “to sit to
attention with legs crossed, hands placed
upon knees and head faced rigidly to the
front.” Prisoners were naked except for
a loincloth—unresisting prey to all the
insect pests of Singapore. Rations fell
in the end to one-quarter pint of rice
and beans to cover two meals and rice
water and greens for breakfast.
Two of Blain’s cell companions died,
emaciated skeletons, beside him. The
routine prescribed no talking. It was an
offence punishable with bashing to smile.
Infringements generally were punished
by bashing or calling the prisoner to the
wire front of the cell, making him put his
nose through the mesh and tweaking it
backward and forward against the wire.
A Living Skeleton
In April, 1945, the Japs carried a living
skeleton out of this cell. He weighed
under seven stone. His limbs were puffed
with beriberi. He had a hernia caused by
ill-treatment. He was covered with
bruises and sores from top to toe, half-
deaf from slappings on the ears. His
teeth were broken and he had a grey
beard. They carried him to the Changi
Hospital, and even the Japanese did not
think it worth while to take the remains
of him back to jail when he had been
roughly patched up.
Such is the man whom Mr. Mulcahy
accused of having used his gold pass to
gain favors from the Japanese. The
writer, who saw his injuries two months
after he returned to Australia and seven
months after he left jail, recoiled in
horror at the condition of that beaten and
emaciated frame.
If Mr. Chifley does not consent to the
inquiry by a Committee of Privileges
which Mr. McEwen proposes he will put
a brand of shame on himself and his
party which will never be effaced. As the
victim of the vile accusation said, the
House should expel the slanderer if h«
cannot prove his words.
And prove them he cannot.
Position Worse in India.
“Ek Bum”: India has been without its
leader. Pundit Nehru having continued ill
throughout the week. In Pakistan feel-
ings become more heated with every
attempt to compose differences. It can
be taken as a certainty that if it were not
for the fact that the British are respected
by the Moslems above other people, and
that the armies of both India and Paki-
stan are still under British command, the
two new “Dominions” would already be
at each other’s throats.
Those who believe that the removal to
India of Sikh and Hindu remnants still
in the north-west will ease the situation
are barking up the wrong tree. All these
people, removed from their lands and
their immemorial surroundings, are burn-
ing for revenge and repatriation. And
although their millions form only a drop
in the ocean in teeming India they are a
dangerous leaven.
When fever and hysteria do their work
and the native princes, whose territories
exceed in extent the old British India,
and who have no liking for being
managed by babus, note the full weak-
ness of the forces which propose to ab-
sorb them into what is called by Con-
gress members “democratic India” the
trouble will really begin.
Mostly it will be trouble for the
Indians, since, though the Hindus have
some fine fighting races, they have not
much of a fighting leadership. What exists
of it wants nothing so much in secret as
to return to the days of the British raj.
Kashmir Fighting
With the invading levies on the out-
skirts of Srinagar, it seemed that the war
was spreading in Kashmir during the
week. The invaders appear to have a
quicksilver quality, largely due, no doubt,
to the fact that they are Moslems
operating in a predominantly Moslem
area. Pakistan newspapers have been
fanning the flames by referring to them
as “our troops,” the suspicion in Indian
minds being increased by the announce-
ment of Pundit Nehru that they are
armed with modern weapons, including
flame-throwers, and that they have
crossed from Pakistan without hindrance
from the Jinnah Government.
The tension increased through a new
quarrel which arose out of the action of
India in taking over a part of the pic-
turesque Junagadh State, in the south-
west of the Kathiawar Peninsula. This
is remote from Kashmir, but so are
many other problems which are whip-
ping the leaderships of India and Paki-
stan into fury.
In Kashmir a Hindu maharajah of a
predominantly Moslem State wishes to
join India. In Junagadh a Moslem nawab
of a predominantly Hindu State wishes
to join Pakistan.
Pakistan, under British military and
vice-regal influence, proposed a series of
peace terms relating to Kashmir, without
avail. These included the withdrawal of
Indian troops, the holding in abeyance
of Sheikh Abdullah’s interim Govern-
ment, the establishment of a national-
agency Government, the demobilisation
of Kashmiri troops and the holding of a
plebiscite to decide whether the State
should become part of India or of Paki-
stan.
Pakistan offered, if these conditions
were carried out, to “exert its influence”
upon the Moslem invaders of Kashmir to
lay down their arms.
This proposal, however, seems only to
have served to increase Indian suspicion
that Pakistan is the master hand behind
the invasion.
The Tragedy of Burma
Meanwhile the rot which has set in
in the British Empire since the Attlee
Government took office is spreading east-
ward. Nothing more abominable has
been done than the “freeing” of Burma,
for which the greatest single campaign
of the Asian war was fought, in order
to hand it over to traitors and Japanese
collaborators, so powerless to govern that
they could not keep assassins out of the
Cabinet room itself, in which Aung Sang
and six Ministers were murdered on
July 19.
“Another scene of ruin,” Mr. Churchill
called it, adding that he had “never ex-
pected to see Aung Sang, whose hands
were dyed with the blood of British and
Burmese, march up the steps of Bucking-
ham Palace as a plenipotentiary.”
He asserted that 12,000 murders in the
first seven months of the year were only
a prelude to a blood welter similar to
that which had already started in India.
He might have added further that if
the Government is not careful the mur-
derous conditions which exist in India
and. Burma will spread to Malaya, which
is a smouldering powder magazine.
All the Old Lion’s angry eloquence,
however, did not prevent the House from
passing the second reading of the Burma
Independence Bill by 288 votes to 114,
with a few long-haired Conservatives
voting with the Government.

Travelling as a passenger on the new
motor vessel Port Napier, now in Aus-
tralian waters on her maiden voyage, is
James Bisset,' former commodore of the
Cunard Line, and commander during the
war years of Queen Mary and Queen
Elizabeth. The skipper went to sea in
1898 as apprentice in a windjammer; he
was 15. He joined the Cunard in 1907,
and during the Kaiser’s war as a R.N.R.
officer he put in three years in command
of a destroyer; but his first Cunard
command didn’t come till 1929, when
he took charge of Aurania on the North
Atlantic run. In the second war for
his services in carrying in the world’s
biggest troopers tens of thousands of
British, American and Australian soldiers
he received a C.B.E. in 1942 and was
knighted in 1945. Last year Cambridge
University conferred on him a distinc-
tion almost unique for a merchant-navy
skipper—an honorary degree of LL.D.
"" The announcement that the ecclesiasti-
cal handle Monsignor has been tacked
on to the name of Father Patrick Joseph
Hartigan will delight thousands of his
co-religionists; others may need to be
reminded that P.J.H. is also known as
“John O’Brien,” under which name he
published Around the Boree Log. A
native of v Yass, Hartigan was ordained
at Goulburn in 1903. He was Inspector
of Schools in the old Goulburn Dio-
cese'for some years and in 1917 be-
came parish priest of Narrandera ; it was
there that he wrote Around the Boree
Log, a collection of tuneful and delight-
fully humorous ballads which found a
wide public and remains high on the
list of “best-sellers” by the native-born.
In 1944 the Monsignor resigned his
parish and retired to Rose Bay convent
as resident chaplain. While there he has
had the opportunity of delving into some
of the by-ways of early Catholic history
in N.S.W. and published a series of
articles in the “Australasian Catholic
Record.” It seems that another Boree
Log is on the stocks ; it will be assured
of a warm welcome.
It was reported of John Gilbert
Winant, whose life came to a tragic end
in Washington last week, that he had
lately been very depressed and felt that
his work for world peace had been
wasted. Of’that portion of his life de-
voted to improving Anglo-American rela-
tions he had no cause for self-condemna-
tion. As Ambassador to Britain during
the war years his work towards securing
a closer understanding between the Eng-
lish-speaking nations was as sincere and
as untiring as that of Walter Hines Page
during World War I. At farewell func-
tions tendered to Winant on leaving
Britain last year Churchill, Bevin, Eden
and others spoke feelingly of the Ameri-
can who, as Bevin said, “had shared their
sorrows and their rations and never once
allowed himself to go beyond what the
Britisher had to endure.” Winant claimed
that he had never felt himself a foreigner
in Britain. He would always feel him-
self a Londoner and he felt that he had
really lived the most of his life in the 54-
years he had spent there. Winant recently
completed the writing of his memoirs. He
had been in ill-health for some time and
his tragic action seems to have been the
result of a momentary impulse of a sick
and worn-out man.
Dr. Charles A. E. Fenner, awarded the

Arthur E. Davis, a Sydney solicitor.
Who served with the Eighth Division, on
Blain, M.H.R.:
I never had a chance to meet Mr. Blain
when overseas, but one incident concerning him
I will never forget. From time to time desper-
ately sick men from the infamous Outram-road
jail were brought out to Changi Hospital. They
suffered the most appalling cruelty at Outram-
road in addition to routine starvation and
received no medical treatment, but occasionally
when a man was almost dead the Japs allowed
him to be evacuated to Changi, by a 17-mile
journey in the back of an open truck exposed
to the tropical sun. Some died on the way,
but others, tragic emaciated wrecks covered
with sores or swollen with beriberi, were saved
by the skill and devotion of our m.os. On
one such occasion a sick man arrived with a
message from Blain more or less as follows:
“Don’t worry about me. The little yellow
bastards will never break me.” And they,
didn’t! Although Blain was older than most
of his fellow-prisoners, being a Digger of
World War I, he saw it out and was only
evacuated to Changi shortly before the war
ended, a very sick man. Having heard Blain’s
colorful description of his jailers, I’d like to hear
his opinion on some of his fellow-Parliamen-
tarians.
Retiring after 50 years with the Vic-
torian railways, Don Cameron has been
chairman of the Commissioner’s Staff
Board since 1927. Most of Victoria’s
locomotive drivers reckon he’s a shrewd
head who knows what he wants and gets
it. They remember how, as eager
youths, tney had to face ms barrage of
questions when he took his board to the
country on a vast recruiting hunt. Its
success is evidenced by the fine types of
men serving in the transportation branch
today. As Deputy-Director of Man-
power during the war years, Cameron
harassed many employers. Any ill-feel-
ing must have soon been forgotten judg-
ing by the number that drank his health
when he left.
Visiting Adelaide for the centenary
celebrations of the Anglican diocese,
Harold Sexton, Bishop of British Colum-
bia, treads familiar ground. He was
born at Mount Gambier, and was a
curate at St. Paul’s, Port Adelaide, St.
George’s, Alberton, and All Saints,
Hindmarsh, before he went to the first
war as a chaplain with the B.E.F. Re-
turning to Australia when the war was
over, he was vicar of St. Martin’s,
Hawksburn (Vic.), from 1920-23, then
went to Britain, where he held various
church offices until 1935, when he was
called from All Saints, Upper Norwood,
to become Bishop Coadjutor of British
Columbia. A year later he became
Bishop. Another visitor for the cele-
brations is D. E. Sydney Woods, 94th
Bishop of Lichfield, who as Lord High
Almoner attends the King at the Abbey
for the annual distribution of Maundy
Money,
W. H. Piggendorff, who succeeds Andy
Moodie as chief of the Division of Plant
Industry, entered the N.S.W. Department
of Agriculture as a scientific trainee in
1924. He graduated B.Sc. in Agriculture
at Sydney Uni. and was appointed Plant
Breeder at Leeton experimental farm.
He concentrated on breeding rice and
other cereals, linseed and pasture plants
under irrigation conditions, and in 1940
added to his job that of special agrL
cultural instructor in general culture of
rice, linseed and other irrigation crops as
well as oil and fibre plants.

cated, mainly in music, at Oxford, and
attained to high distinction in England
before he returned to Australia to be-
come eventually city organist at the Town
Hall. The City Fathers didn’t recognise
his quality. He resigned, became organ-
ist and instructor at the Magdalen Col-
lege, Oxford, and in 1941 was offered
Westminster Abbey, one of the richest
prizes of the profession.
One regular Sydney racegoer, depicted

the William Inglis who founded the firm,
Reg was born in Sydney in 1880 and
went from Sydney Grammar straight into
his present business. Beginning by ex-
tolling the virtues of pigs and calves,
which he sold at the foot of Pyrmont
Bridge, Reg Inglis handled the dispersal
of the Segenhoe Stud in 1918. Since
then he’s concentrated on thoroughbreds
and fat cattle, though of late years son

has been handling the cattle. John’s dad
wielded the hammer when Shannon was

16,000 guineas), Heroic’s sire and dam,
Valais and Chersonese, his son Ajax and
Ajax’s son Magnificent. Thoroughbred
bargains he knocked down cheap were
Windbag and David, and at the Trent-
ham (N.Z.) sales in 1928 he disposed of
a rather scraggy-looking Night Raid colt
for 170 guineas. It was Phar Lap, winner
of £66,738 in stake money. When not

The Royal Navy is to honor the
memory of Admiral of the Fleet Sir
Dudley Pound, who died on Trafalgar
Day four years ago, with a stained-glass
window in the chapel of the Royal Naval
College at Dartmouth, It is also intended
to erect a plaque in the crypt of St.
Paul’s. Officers and men of the navy will
subscribe to the cost. Admiral Pound
was Chief of the Naval Staff for the first
four years of the war, and was mainly re-
sponsible for the strategy which secured
England’s communications. Australian
sailors will perhaps remember him better
as the admiral commanding the Mediter-
ranean Fleet in the mid-ninetesn-thirties
when the cruiser Australia won the fleet
regatta two years running.
Tilly Aston, dead in Melbourne at 74,
was a fine example of a woman who
made a disability into an advantage.
Blinded at seven, she started her edu-
cation at the School for the Blind in
Melbourne and later under private tutors
took the Arts Course at the University
of Melbourne. She became a teacher
in music and general studies, at the Blind
School in 1912, but after 13 years an
accidental fall provided another disability
which had to be compensated for, Tilly
Aston thereupon devoted herself to the
uplift of the sightless in an honorary
capacity. It was she who was mainly re-
sponsible for the founding of the great
library of the Victorian Association of
Braille-writers and she was president of
the Association for Advancement of the
Blind which she established. She directed
the Red Cross knitters who produced an
enormous quantity of first-class garments
during the war, and in addition published
half a dozen books of her own poems as
well as her memoirs, was a skilled crafts-
man and was a lover of the theatre. She
corresponded in Esperanto with blind
people in other countries, and became
a greatly honored member of the Mel-
bourne Bread and Cheese Club.
Into the Silence;
In Melbourne, Joseph Ewing, former general
manager of the E.S. and A. Bank, who retired
last year. In his young days he was a noted
foot-runner and inter-State tennis-player.
At 83, in Surrey, England, Frederick William
Grimwade, former chairman and managing
director of Drug Houses of Australia Export,

In Melbourne, at 63, Charles Henry Albert,
stage manager and producer and one of Aus-
tralia’s most versatile character actors. His
first appearance behind the footlights was with
Pollard’s Lilliputians, his last with the Edwin

at the Comedy, Melbourne.
In Adelaide, at 72, William Arthur Dunn,
Methodist minister for over 50 years and former
secretary and president of the Methodist Con-
ference in S.A.
At 71, in Adelaide, Herbert Solomon, former
barrister and solicitor. He graduated at Adel-
aide University 48 years back, was one-time
president of the Justices’ Association, the
Friendly Societies’ Union, and prominently asso-
ciated with the Australian Natives’ Association.
In Adelaide, at 85, Peter Gannoni, well known
as an undertaker, and former Mayor of Ken-
sington and Norwood, who served as a mem-
ber of the Council for over 37 years.
In Brisbane, at 78, Rev. M. Scott Fletcher,
M.A., B.Lit., former Professor of Philosophy
at the University of Queensland, Master of
King’s College, Brisbane, and of Wesley College,
Sydney. Over the age for retirement when the
war broke out, he kept on to permit younger
men to serve in the armed forces, and the extra
strain contributed to his final breakdown in
health.

Women's Letters
From Melbourne
An imposing array of top-hatted V.R.C.
committee members greeted the Governor
of Victoria, Sir Winston Dugan, and Lady
Dugan when they arrived at ■ Fleming-
ton for the Melbourne Cup. And it was
the top-hatted gentlemen who stole the
show from the ladies, for with a grim,
drab day dressing was just as drab. Even
the flowers which rioted over the edge
of lawns looked sad and dismal. Women
who refused to spend most of the day
chasing a hat madly round the lawns
tied them on with veiling or else wore
a hat so small that it was secure. Hooded
raincoats made their first appearance;
the Lady Mayoress chose one in light
navy satin. Every shade of red was
worn.
Lady Dugan was distinctive in a brick-
dust-red and nut-brown herringbone
’tweed coat. The upturned brim of her
matching red hat was swathed in brown
ribbon, from which brown veiling fell
over her face. With Lady Dugan was
the Viscountess Dunwich, whose tailored
suit of clay-pink fine tweed featured a
brown velvet collar which picked up
the color of her dark-brown felt hat
turned sharply off the face. The striking
.wooden clogs with their tan suede uppers
worn by her daughter, the Hon. Marye
Rous, were a heritage from Lady
Grosvenor, Marye’s grandmother. One
of the brightest figures on the racecourse
was Mrs. lan Potter, who teamed a black
jacket suit, royal-blue velvet snood, scarlet
suede gloves and a gaily-striped umbrella.
Mrs. Ken Hooper’s royal-blue and emer-
ald-satin-swathed turban was worn with
a black coat. Mrs. S. G. Tomkins was
also in black, her burnt-sugar straw sailor
hat trimmed with black grosgrain ribbon
and black cocq features. Caramel acces-
sories and a hat of coarse straw with a
brown satin bow went with Mrs. Charles
Davis’s jacket suit of junior blue. Mrs.
O. McL. Falkiner wore a greenish-grey
tweed coat over her frock of tabac
brown ; her sou’-wester hat matched her
frock. Mrs. Hudson Henry chose a
yellow corduroy suit with a matching
cloche hat. Mrs. Dally-Watkins’s grey
wool coat was worn over a black frock ;
her black hat had touches of red.
Mrs. Alan Bragg wore a long plaid
head-scarf, the ends of which were looped
through the belt of her grey tweed coat.
Another follower of the scarf fashion
was Mrs. Everard Baillieu —hers was of
spice-brown jersey. Mrs. David Knox,
an Englishwoman seeing her first Mel-
bourne Cup—she arrived from England
only on Cup morning—tied a yellow-and-
white scarf over her small leopard-skin
cap; her matching fur coat was worn
over grey-and-white tweeds. Mrs. R.
Josephs’s wide-brimmed felt hat was
trimmed with a large speckled feather
which outlined the upturned brim. A
blue fox coat with a nipped-in waistline
and petal-shaped back was worn by Mrs.
L. Sangster over her brown tweed frock.
Mrs. Yott, of Murray, S.A., was garbed
in soft-grey suiting and small grey felt
hat. With her saffron-yellow suit Mrs,
F. Falkiner wore a rolled-back white felt
hat. The jacket of Mrs. Geoffrey Wat-
son’s navy suit featured the longer line ;
her navy hat carried navy and white
stripes.
Indifferent weather again dogged race-
goers for the fourth day of the spring
racing carnival. Lightweight suits and
wool coats were popular, and the trusty
raincoat was as indispensable a part of
the outfit as hat and gloves. Once again
women refused to have anything to do
with the longer hemline, but they have
taken to the large cartwheel hat, worn
off the face, and the small-bonnet type
hat tied in place with chiffon or veiling.
The tendency is the emphasis on color
and on brighter accessories.
One of the smartest outfits seen on
Saturday was the cerise wool suit worn
with a blue-straw sailor hat by Jean
Darragh. Dulcie Fraser wore a mig-
nonette-green face-cloth suit and small
brown hat and accessories. The small
rose-pink hat and blouse worn by Mrs.
Ethel King with her black suit was
attractive. Sydney visitor Louise Brad-
shaw wore a white frock patterned in
parma-violet flowers under her black
tailored coat and a small black hat.
Mrs. Lucy Sechiari, just arrived from
England to take up her new appointment
as matron of the Children’s Hospital,
must have been delighted at the warmth
of the welcome she received at the
afternoon party given by the Chief Jus-
tice, Sir John Latham, and Lady Latham.
Large bowls of rhododendrons and del-
phiniums, which had come from the
Latham home at Ferny Creek, decorated
the Domain-road flat where Sir John and
Lady Latham live while in town. Lady
Latham is the busy president of the hos-
pital, and the party gave Mrs. Sechiari
an opportunity to meet the matrons and
committee members of various hospitals.
She wore a slim-fitting black-and-white-
patterned frock with a slightly flared
peplum and a white straw hat trimmed
with white veiling and large white roses.
Lady Latham, who was assisted by her
husband and daughter Freda in caring for
guests, chose a multi-colored silk frock
and matching jacket. Mrs. Edgar Rouse,
who was given the job of adding the
finishing touches to Mrs. Sechiari’s flat
at the hospital—a study in pale-green
walls and floral chintz-covered furniture
—was at the party. So was the Murdoch
lady, another member of the Children’s
Hospital committee ; her black ensemble
was contrasted by the two pink peonies
she wore in her black hat. Other guests
included Mrs. Norman Harris, represent-
ing the Women’s Hospital, and also its
matron, Miss A. Sage. Miss Lydia
Shaw, matron of the Alfred Hospital,
and Miss I. Richardson, matron of the
Austin Hospital, were also there to wel-
come a fellow-worker in the cause of re-
lieving suffering, A notable guest was
Miss Jane Bell, a former matron of the
Melbourne Hospital, who has contributed
so much to the Royal College of Nurs-
ing.
This Broothorn study is of Dympna
O’Collins, second daughter of Mr. and
Mrs. Frank O’Collins, of Frankston, who
leaves soon for England to visit her sister
Moira, wife of Dr. Jim Peters, who, with
her husband and small daughter, is living
in Kent. Dympna, who was educated at
the Sacred Heart Convent, Camberwell,
acted as her father’s secretary for two
years and also did 12 months’ nursing at
St. Vincent’s Hospital. Dympna expects
to be in England for 12 months.
Among the many guests at the late-
afternoon party given at Rock Lodge
by Mr. and Mrs. Frank O’Collins to
farewell Dympna were General and
Mrs. Cawthorne, who are also leaving
for England and with whom Dympna
will travel; Brigadier'and Mrs. Furnell,
Dr. and Mrs. Arthur Joyce and Dr. and
Mrs. Sam Marron —their daughter Betty
is in England and Dympna will meet her
there. With P. L. Coleman was Mrs.
Coleman, her aqua-blue wool frock
trimmed with small crystal beads. Mrs.
O’Collins’s frock was a pale-rose silk on
which Was printed replicas of old Syd-
ney houses. With Mrs. O’Brien, simply
frocked in navy with touches of white
combined with a small navy hat banded
in white, was her daughter Bernadette,
whose frock was of brown velvet.
Francis Galbally, to whom Bernadette is
engaged, was with them. There were
four Galbally boys at the party; the
eldest, Dr. F. Galbally, was with his wife.
Dympna wore a black taffetta ballerina
frock.
Glorious roses in every shade decor-
ated the reception rooms' of the Queens-
road home of Dr. and Mrs. J. C. Lewis
when they entertained inter-State visitors
at a cheery after-the-Oaks party. Mrs.
Lewis received her guests in a black suit
with a platina fox collar and a hyacinth-
blue flower hat. Among the Sydney
visitors were Mr. and Mrs. J. C. Hawkins,
she in a floral silk suit and large black
hat; Mr. and Mrs. Poynter and Mr. and
Mrs. Donniston. Under a summer
ermine coat Mrs. J. McGrath wore a
silver-grey shirtmaker frock ; her small
hat was grey, her accessories black.
Adelaide visitor Corinna Nitschke wore
an English corduroy velvet suit in beech
brown, with matching accessories and
hat. Roslyn Nitschke was in grey, with
a small grey felt beret. Trev Scott, from
Mt. Gambier, wore a grey suit and royal-
blue swathed hat. The Stanley Churches,
the A. Rochforts and Mrs. Ken Hooper,
who set off her fair coloring with a frock
of mist-blue crepe and matching hat,
were also at the party.
From Sydney
A garden party of almost Domain
dimensions is planned by the Governor
and Mrs. Northcott for the 20th of
November. In extremely neat script
above the coat of arms runs a
line telling that the party is in honor of
the marriage of H.R.H. Princess
Elizabeth. Guests are bidden for three
o’clock on the Thursday afternoon.
All things went according to schedule
last Wednesday when the Governor’s
daughter Marjorie married Major
Donald Coburn. St. Andrew’s was
crowded with guests, and those of the
public who just can’t resist a wedding ;
Archbishop Mowll blessed the vows. The
bride’s blue-white chiffons and silver
lame and really gorgeous veil, and her
three attractive attendants, sister Eliza-
beth, Sheila Graham and Sheila Collett, in
their full-skirted powder-blue nylon frocks
and head-dresses in which pale and dark
lilac were woven, were greeted with in-
voluntary “ohs” of admiration ; the choir
soared in song ; the weather did the right
thing and was perfect. At Government
House itself the flower beds were gay, the
lawns bright green. In the square en-
trance-hall were tall jars filled with
thickly-flowered stems of gladioli and
bowls of prize-size rhododendron blooms.
The Governor, looking very soldierly in
his General’s uniform, and Mrs. North-
cott, in brightly-patterned silks and carry-
ing a spray of frangipanni, and the
’groom’s mother, a study in silver-greys,
greeted the guests. Then came the bride
and Major Coburn, and then the three
bridesmaids. The dominating color of the
frocking was blue and the wedding veil
was a sherbet of white tulle on which was
mounted a wide scarf of delicate Honiton
lace —a present from the bridegroom's
mother. The bride’s table, decked with
lily of the valley, was placed at the top
end of the ballroom.
There were lots of champagne and very
good sherry and buffets piled with
savories, but nowhere a sandwich, prov
ing that a bakers’ strike smacks the bread-
crock of Government House the same as
that of Waterloo. Archbishop Mowll
gave the toast of the pair he had newly
wed, making a neat and concise job of
it The bridegroom retaliated with one
all rosy with happiness. He handed out
a bright bon-bon of thanks to everybody
in any way connected with his marriage.
He didn’t get along to thanking Hirohito,
though it was through the occupation of
Japan he»and the new Mrs. Coburn had
met.
Some of the guests at this wedding feast
wore swooningly smart wedding gar-
ments —the other girl did the swooning
from envy. For instance, the photo-
graphers didn't miss Mrs. Eugene Goos-
sens, sleek with black satin and gleaming
with a necklace of costume jewellery,
and the wife of Dr. Hugh Poate in
soft hyacinth pink, and Mrs. Charles
Lloyd Jones, looking very graceful,
all Paris in her silver-grey frock,
its ankle-length skirt making .correct bal-
ance for her sweeping black hat. There
was a small matter of platina foxes, too,
not to be overlooked. Very handsome
in black was Mrs. George Vasey, banner-
bearer for the War Widows’ Guild.
General Berryman and his wife were
among the guests; so were the L. A.
Robbs and small daughter Judith.
Dr. Frances Mackay and Mrs. W. R.
Dovey and her daughter the Kelso
King lady, the Mervyn Finlays,
Noreen Dangar, Mrs. Persia Porter
of the V.A.Ds., knight Harry Mox-
ham and his wife, the banking McKeri-
hans, Beulah Bolton and other Victoria
Leaguers, the Guy Blaxlands —her outfit
of softest powder blue Rosemary
Parker, Mr. and Mrs. Alan Foott, Miss
Devine from Melbourne, were others of
the company.
If you have not already been to the
Fashion Parades being staged at Anthony
Horderns’, you have still today and to-
morrow to rectify your mistake. The
parades present a series of lovely frocks
made of woman’s old charmer, “Broderie
Anglaise.”* These are shown in dinner,
dance, debutante and cocktail frocks for
the young girl. To accompany the frocks
Mrs. Vyvyan Holland, of Cyclax,
London, will supply the right com-
mentary. She will also speak on “London
from the Woman’s Angle,” introducing
the new Cyclax range for the deb., called
“Demoiselle.”
The Royal Sydney Golf Club party is
always one of the best attended —about
500 heard over its radios how Hiraji
won the 1947 Cup. A few hundreds
popped out to Elanora, too. The Yacht
Squadron at Kirribilli put on a good
show. In David Jones’s George-street
restaurant there was a card party of great
size in aid of the Dalwood Health
Homes. As usual the Women Pioneers
planned a pleasant party in their club
rooms. New president Mrs. R. Vallack
did the honors, and former president
Mrs. Lingham brought her friendly smile
and attractive black-and-white frocking
to the day. Mrs. Merewether and daugh-
ter Maisie had a piquant banking inci-
dent to« relate and were asked and asked
again for the details. Miss Merewether’s
outfit had petunia for its dominating
shade. Club steward Sam was again a
hero. Bread strike or no bread strike,
Sam had supplied a sumptuous variety
of sandwiches.
The Institute of Journalists’ lunch last
week was a 100 p.c. newspaper affair.
Guest of honor was Alf King, on leave
from Australian Associated Press. Mr.
King has been in charge of the
London office of A.A.P. for several
years. He described the workings of a
world news service—told of the millions
of words that are handled daily, dissected
and finally cut to the few thousands which
are the real meat of the news to be dis-
seminated to Australia. He talked of
Beam, and Flash, and televised news and
a wizard machine called colloquially
“hell” which does everything with words
but think them up. Daily-newspapermen
hung on his words in rapt attention. The
Institute’s popular president, Dr. Charles
Bean, introduced the speaker. The ball-
room of C.U.S.A. House was the In-
stitute’s new lunching place.
This is a Norton Trevaire photograph
of Mrs. John Boviil, of Point Piper,
one of the belles of 1947 Sydney’s social
world.
“The Magic Flute” piped a full house
to the Conservatorium last Saturday
night. As usual the Mozart music was
perfect, and in it there was the usual
interplay of bright wit, as of brilliant
and animated dialogue. Florent Hoog-
stoel had reason to be proud of his
orchestra, as had Frederick Foxley of
his chorus. Papageno, the bird-catcher
character, who always appears clad in
feathers, like an animated feather-duster,
was played by Donald Graham. Donald
has a melodic voice and a stage sense,
and presented Papageno as a person at
once naive and sturdy.
George Tiley sang well as the Prince in
search of the beauteous Pamina ; in this
role Margaret Kerr was, in spite of her
trials, in both good voice'and good looks.
Attractive girls, too, were the three ladies-
in-waiting to the Queen of Night, though
at first appearance they did seem a little
nervous in the mist of mysticism. As
Sarastro the High Priest, Frank Lisle im-
pressed. Queen of the Night, Ina Crouch,
in her soft and flowing black drapes,
shiny, one supposes, with stars, retained
the sweetness of her note in spite of the
vengeful nature of her song. Her teachers,
Roland and Thelma Foster, listened
closely from the audience. Here were
also the Conservatorium’s Director
Eugene Goossens and Mrs. Goossens, a
soft woollen coat of raspberry-red thrown
over the shoulders of her ground-length
black-and-white dinner frock. Hilda
Mulligan was responsible for production.
Mary, second daughter of the R. B.
Rosses, of Harden, became the bride of
Bill Armstrong, of Wollstonecraft, last
Saturday in the Ross Memorial Church
at Harden. The reception was at Jellambi,
home of the bride’s parents.
Art is what you make it —or make of
it. If you don’t believe this, visit the ex-
hibition of the Contemporary Art
Society in the Education Building, You
can start with the abstracts on the lower
wall of the inside gallery or the paint-
ing of the small boy that will haunt with
its look of dread. That is in the first
room. Margaret Olley’s big flower paint-
ing on the long wall of the second room
will fascinate, but it’s probably sold, for
two buyers were inquiring about it be-
fore the show opened.
The trustees of the Gallery went gravely
around the walls, as is proper in the
spenders of public money. On Friday they
had decided on two purchases—one at
two guineas. Keenly-interested visitor
was Hal Missingham, director of the
Gallery. The show was opened on Satur-
day by Eugene Goossens.

The infant and profitable electric-cable-
making section (established in 1940) of
this robust 13-year-old was passed to a
new co., Olympic Cables, Ltd., half-way
through the last term. The price was
£191,457 in f.-p. ss. shares, and there was
a profit on the deal of £21,955, which
was added to reserves.
Of the 765,828 shares received from the
cable co., the vendor retained 69,828 and
distributed the balance (696,000) in part
return of capital, reducing the figure from
£696,000 in £1 shares to £522,000 in 15s.
shares, which were then split into three
units of ss, each. Holders of each old
pound share in the Tyre Co. (worth 665.
on the market early in 1947) thus received
three f.-p. ss. shares (now priced at
225. 3d. each), plus one f.-p. ss. share (not
yet listed) in the Cable Co,
As for divs. the Tyre Co. paid 6\ p.c.
for the first and p.c. for the second
half of the term, making a flat 14 p.c.
for the year. For its first six months to
June 30 the Cable Co. paid 6j p.c., with
a wide margin. So from both cos. holders
of the old pound shares received divs.
aggregating 13i p.c. on the face value of
their original holdings, as against 1 \\ p.c.
in the previous year. If divs. for the
current year continue at the same rate as
for the six months to June 30 last —and
there are good reasons for believing they
will—aggregate receipts from both cos.
will total p.c. on the original holdings
just, referred to.
And since the close of accounts each
co. has made a new pref. issue at par.,
which has been in the nature of a bonus
to shareholders because of the premium
at which the scrip now stands in the
market. Those on the Tyre Co.’s register
were offered 198,857 £1 5 p.c. cum. prefs.,
two for 21, and those on the Cable Co.’s
register 51,055 £1 5 p.c. cum. prefs., one
for 15. Both cos.’ prefs. (now paid to 155.)
are priced at 20s. 9d. each in the market.
When all the money on both lots is in
paid capital will be £720,857 Tyre Co.
and £242,514 Cable Co., which intends to
seek Treasury approval to issue a further
45.000 (approx.) £1 5 p.c. prefs. in the
near future. So shareholders have nothing
to complain of in the reshuffle, the pre-
cise purpose of which was not explained
by the board.
Without the aid of cable sales for the
last half of the term, the Tyre Co.’s turn-
over reached a new record, exceeding the
£3,000,000 mark. Government control of
purchase and use of rubber ceased, the
raw stuff came forward in satisfactory
volume, and American synthetic kept the
price down. On the demand side there
was a strong call for replacements, as
well as for initial shoeing, the volume of
which can be expected to increase as new
vehicles become available.
After allowing £87,776 (down £23,329)
for depreciation and £162,100 (up £66,600)
for taxation, profit claimed was £108,166
(up £11,269). But the tax provision in-
cludes £69,370 for war-time (co.) tax,
now abolished in respect of 1946-47 earn-
ings. Actual net result was therefore
£177,536, as shown in the table. That was
29.1 p.c. on average capital employed, or
34 p.c. oh capital as it now stands, and,
“given reasonably stable conditions politi-
cally and industrially,” the current term
“should be at least as satisfactory as the
one just completed,” the chairman says.
There is nothing to worry about in the
finances:

appears in the books at £81,299. After
disclosing an inner reserve of £37,772
against possible war-thne losses, stocks
are up £233,589. The sharp drop in
debtors’ balances (down £288,842) and
sundry creditors (down £144,418) is due
mainly to collection of accounts con-
nected with the cable section. When the
books closed the more or less liquid sur-
plus amounted to £628,621.

trical components on a small scale, and
these activities were intensified after
1937. In the same year its name was
changed from Eastern Trading Co, to
E.T.C. Industries; present title came
from a third christening in 1942.
During the war co. specialised in
aircraft accessories, including types of
electrical starter motors, generators and
magnetos not previously made in Aus-
tralia. Factory staff, which had num-
bered about 50 in 1935, passed the 800
mark in 1943. A Government “aero-
electrics annexe” was built adjoining
Tecnico’s factory at Marrickville (N.S.W.)
and operated under the co.’s direction
throughout the war ; it has recently been
sold to Tecnico for an unstated amount.
Although aircraft orders have now
greatly diminished “a steady turnover”
in sales and repair jobs was reported last
term, and servicing shops at the Mascot,
Bankstown and Camden (N.S.W.) air-
fields are being maintained.
It is hoped that the technical capacity
gained in war-time will now be largely
applied to the local motor-car, industry.
In the meantime, besides meeting a
steady demand for radio components,
the co. has engaged in quantity pro-
duction of vacuum-cleaners. Post-
war demand for these has, perhaps,
been abnormal and largely non-recurring,
but their manufacture was “a valuable
training ground for the introduction of
mass-production methods.” They helped
to make last year’s turnover a record
and contributed to a satisfactory profit,
which benefited from the removal of
War-time (Co.) Tax.
The net figure (£22,817) represented
12.4 p.c. on ordinary capital after paying
the pref. dividend, compared with 11.4,
11.9, 9.8, 15.7 and 19.7 p.c. back to
1942.
Continuity of production has been en-
sured as far as possible by large-scale
forward buying of raw materials and
parts which are in short supply. Last
term’s increase in stocks by £93,075, or
120 p.c., should prove particularly valu-
able under current dollar-import restric-
tions :

Shares in the wholly-owned subsidiary
—Tecnico Electronics Pty., which turns
out radio and electronic parts and earned
£3343 last term, not included in parent’s
profits—are shown at £1916 above par.
The increase of £38,856 in fixed assets
is largely due to acquisition of the Gov-
ernment annexe, and accounts for the
slip of £30,570 in the net liquid position
(£96,865). The lack of funds for working
capital has been alleviated since the
close of accounts by an issue of 49,600
£1 ords. at a 6s. premium; paid capital
now comprises 40,000 1\ p.c. cum. pref.
and’ 209,000 ords., all fully paid to £l.
The question of finding peace-time em-
ployment for the co.’s full productive
capacity may not yet be completely
solved. Chairman and managing director
A. C. Millengen, who remarked 12 months
ago that production “could be such as
not to be readily absorbed in Australia,”
and concluded it was advisable to build
up an export trade, is at present abroad
exploring new openings. Recent addi-
tions to the repertoire include an indus-
trial magneto, electric floor-polisher and
coasting hub for cycles; in automotive
electrical equipment a stage of “for-
ward planning” is reported.
Sales in the first four months of this
term have been well maintained, but wage
and other costs are rising, there is more
capital to be fed, and directors have
rightly emphasised the desirability ot
strengthening reserves. On a 1\ p.c. div.
basis the £1 ords. at 345. 6d. offer a
4.4 p.c. yield. The prefs. at 31s. 9d.
yield 4.7 p.c. Net tangible asset backing
is £5 10s. 7d. for each pref. and 225. Bd.
for the ords.

Goods came forward in better volume
and greater variety last term, though
quality was below pre-war standard.
The co.’s own five clothing factories
together produced well over a million
pounds’ worth of manufactured goods,
and the shoe-manufacturing subsidiary
(Selby and Co.) contributed handsomely
to the increase, enabling wholesale as
well as retail profits to be gathered on
a substantial portion of turnover. Also,
more customers than ever streamed
through the three retail stores—one each
in Elizabeth, Market and George streets
—and they had plenty of money in their
pockets.
The growth in turnover was 24.4 p.c.,
which was above average, and compares
with an increase of 27 p.c. for the
previous term, which was below average.
Here are the percentage changes in
aggregate sales of 22 Sydney stores com-
pared with the corresponding period of
the previous year:

Sales for 1946-47 were over 91 p.c. above
the 1938-39 level, due partly to the rise
in prices, which are still on the up-grade.
The larger turnover more than offset
the growth in exes., due to wage lifts, re-
sumption of deliveries and higher cost of
everything used in connection with the
business. Net earnings (up £25,685)
reached a record £233,315. That was

To the fond relative it’s something for wonder that a child
should be able to fly thousands of miles in a 8.0.A.C.
Speedbird—alone. To the child, flying is merely a very
comfortable way of travelling fast.
Every year 8.0.A.C. carries 150,000 passengers on 72,000
miles of routes. These passengers are flown by 8.0.A.C.
pilots, of whom 100 have over a million miles’ flying experience
each. Men who have learned how in the 28 years of B.O.A.C’s

ever, that capital (pref. and ord.) has the
support and assistance of an almost equal
amount of reserves. On the two com-
bined the year’s net earnings were equal
to 9 p.c. The div., kept at 10 p.c., was
sweetened with a 10-for-81 bonus-scrip
issue. It was not a bonus issue in the
ordinary sense of the term, inasmuch as
it was not a capitalisation of surplus
earnings but of £lOO,OOO put up by
shareholders in the form of share pre-
miums shortly before the war.

Outstanding features last term were an
increase of £471,355 in stocks, largely a
hedge against rising prices, scarcities and
delays in delivery, and the addition of
£185,896 to debtors’ balances, which re-
flects the growth in credit sales. To
meet the outlay the co. leant upon sundry
creditors for an extra £459,366 and drew
upon cash, etc., for The more
or less liquid surplus (£784,681) was
£114,312 stronger.
The 40-hour week and inevitable rise in
wage and other costs will bump up out-
goings. The dollar shortage and cuts in
imports from U.S. will restrict supplies
from that source ; but there is roomlfor
further expansion of output from Austra-
lian factories. Sales continue at a high
level.
At 58s. 3d. (435. a year ago) the ords.
return 3.4 p.c. on a 10 p.c. div. basis;
and it is doubtful whether better than
10 p.c. need be expected, despite the wide
margin between earnings and distribu-
tions. The first prefs. at 30s. 6d. and the
seconds at 345. 6d. yield 3.9 p.c. and 4.3
p.c. respectively. Net tangible cover is

“Towersite”: W. H. Clark, chairman
of Black Jack, Charters Towers (N.Q.),
and E. E. D. White, a leading pastoralist,
have secured an authority to prospect
over 1920 acres covering many of the
main workings on the Towers. The term
is two years, with option to renew for
another year ; £6OOO to be spent testing
the area by diamond-drilling and under-
ground development. By sinking No. 6
Day Dawn (Wallis’s) underlie shaft
another 50ft. to 100 ft. it is believed that
information will be obtained clinching
the case for a central deep shaft. In 1913
the then veteran goldfielder Tom Mills
proposed a large vertical circular shaft
4000 ft. deep, centrally situated, to exploit
the deeper ground. The Mines Depart-
ment was asked to subsidise the project
to the extent of £60,000 and to lift the
restriction on maximum lease areas, but
the proposal was eventually turned down.
The 1930 Royal Commission on mining
in Queensland reported that such a
shaft might have greatly prolonged the
life of the field. E, J. Lawn, then In-
spector of Mines, quoted the Brilliant
Extended bottom level as having three
feet of loz. to 2oz. ore left, and the
expensive Brilliant Deeps to have a simi-
lar body of ounce stuff. The Brilliant Ex-
tended No. 3 underlie shaft (3045 ft.) is
recorded as the deepest mining in
Queensland. Small areas worked by
small-capacity deep shafts, together with
increasing water burdens as the number
of mines working lessened, decreed the
end of all profitable deep working. Gov-
ernment geologist Reid reported on the
field in 1917 ; and about 1934 Gold Mines
of Australia looked over it and the
near-by Ravenswood, but the co. was
attracted elsewhere, though credited with
the idea of returning later.

From London: Lake View share-
holders will rejoice when they see this
year’s report and statement of accounts.
It is a long time since results have been
so good. The surprising thing is that
g.m. Joe Thorn and his staff achieved
what they have in the face of shortages
of both labor and materials. At the
annual meeting at the end of this month
or beginning of next the directors might
have to defend their action in exercising*
with Wiluna and Gold Fields Australian,
the option on the Porphyry mine, a low-
grade concern at Edjudina (W.A.). “Pro-
fit in sight” is said to be substantially
more than the purchase consideration.
From March 5 to June 30, 8574 ft. of
development work was done in the co.’s
Kalgoorlie Golden Mile mines. In the
Lake View block 1242 ft. of driving was
carried out, of which 979 ft. was in ore
of sdwt. grade over a width of sft. In
the western group—Chaffers, Hannan’s
Star, Golden Horseshoe and other areas
—driving totalled 2717 ft., of which
1942 ft. was in ore averaging s.9dwt. over
a width of 59 inches. Thus, of the three-
quarters of a mile of driving done in the
whole property, more than half a mile
was in payable ore.

Ballet Rambert.
Gustav Holst’s “The Planets,” choreo-
graphy by Antony Tudor, is the most
considerable addition to date to the
repertoire of the Ballet Rambert at the
Princess, Melbourne. It is also the
most satisfying. Venus, Mars, Mercury
and Neptune were the gods selected to
preside over the gyrations of mortals in
the four movements. There was an im-
pressionist flavor about the dancing
which matched Holst’s suggestive music
and, for once in a way, Hugh Steven-
son’s scenic backgrounds, dim, vague
and not too insistent as in other ballets,
wasn’t in disharmony with either.
Belinda Wright, the company’s most
classic dancer, and John Gilpin por-
trayed the earthbound lovers brought to-
gether by the goddess in the first move-
ment, Walter Gore, bearing a strong re-
semblance both in looks and motion to
Ted Shawn, was the mortal tortured to
self-destruction by the god of war in the
second, and Sally Gilmour gave a vivid
lead to the excited men and damsels
under the influence of the god of com-
merce and sharp practice in the scherzo.
The Neptunian finale was apparently en-
acted on the floor of the ocean in an un-
canny green light. The general fishiness
of the proceedings was marvellously de-
picted by Joyce Graeme and the corps
de ballet.
“Plaisance,” to Rossini’s seductive,
music, showed that the company has a
surprising number of competent dancers,
all much on the same level, but it was
difficult to make the abstraction to their
movements from the modern backdrop,
which looked like an attempt by a
juvenile artist to depict the Flemington
Racecourse in all its appalling desolation
after the spring meeting. «
Earlier the company presented “The
Fugitive” of Andree Howard to the
music of Leonard Salzedo, It ex-
celled itself in bringing out the
nuances of the simple story of the
wounded fugitive from the Confederate
forces in the American Civil War who
shelters in the home of an enemy general
only to find that the jealousy of the
general’s two daughters is far more ruth-
less than the vengeance of his pursuers.
Walter Gore flung himself into the role
of the soldier with an extraordinary
abandon —factual details like wounds
don’t bother the choreographers of ballet
—and he was ably seconded by Sally
Gilmour, as the general’s lovesick younger
daughter. Her body was as elastic as her
emotions and her face was as expressive
as everything else about her.
“Peter and the Wolf,” a fable without
a moral, had the services of the same ver-
satile young lady. It is a joke to Proko-
fieff’s music about a wolf, a duck, a cat
and other fauna with an original touch
about it inasmuch as it has a narrator
interpreting the action. It would make
a good introduction to ballet for
children.
Belinda Wright and John Gilpin, danc-
ing and miming in the Bluebird excerpt
from “The Sleeping Princess,” brought
the house down. “Les Sylphides” is
generally considered the test of a com-
pany’s competency, and the Ramberts
came out of it with distinction. #
Goossens and Noske.
At his first appearance with the Sym-
phony Orchestra at the Town Hall, Mel-
bourne, since his return to Australia,
Eugene Goossens had a curiously mixed
reception. The response of a packed
house to the Bruckner Symphony No. 6
in A Major (first Victorian performance)
was comparatively apathetic, and the
applause threatened to peter out before
the conductor was recalled for the first
time. However, a few enthusiasts for this
music, which has reminiscences of
Wagner, kept it going until his second
recall, when it stopped dead.
Amends were made over the other
three items on a distinguished programme.
The favorite was Lalo’s lovely Symphonic
Espagnolo in D Minor with its energetic
rhythms. Mr. Goossens was as energetic
as the music.
Willem Noske, the Dutch violinist,
was soloist in the Lalo. He took
the difficult piece with the utmost
confidence, though his movements were
nervous and at times melodramatic. At
the end of a bravura passage he would
carry his bow on with a triumphant
sweep into the air, and his acknowledg-
ment of the applause was new to Mel-
bourne. As soon as he finished he turned
his back on the audience (which was
applauding fervently) and bowed to the
orchestra. He then seized the conductor’s
hand and pumped it vigorously, doing
the same with Bertha Jorgensen, the
orchestral leader. Finally he remembered
the audience, still applauding frantically,
vouchsafed it two brief bows and walked
off.
"While the Sun Shines. "
Terence Rattigan’s recipe for a suc-
cessful box-office attraction is simple. In
“While the Sun Shines,” put on by Mel-
bourne’s National Theatre, there is a
British rating who happens to be a lord
in private practice, an American soldier
and a Frenchman, and there is also a
general who is a duke and whose
daughter is a lady. There is much talk
of trollops, and the duke gets so in-
terested in the American game of craps
that he forgets that the stakes are his
daughter.
There is nobody in the piece remotely
resembling a human being, and Mr. Rat-
tigan’s alleged talent for dialogue con-
sists of getting these four people to-
gether discussing at great length feel-
ings they couldn’t possibly have about
situations that couldn’t occur outside a
popular playwright’s imagination.
The piece was played as well as it
could be played by Margaret Fitzgibbon,
Keith Grieve, Reg Gillam and Gustav
Buckham.
* * * *
Few pianists can make such a varied
feast of an all-Chopin programme as
Paul Schramm, who is back at the Town
Hall, Melbourne. He showed his re-
markable concentration, the unerring aim
of his fingers—which are as faultless in a
soft middle-piano whisper as in a wild
sweep that threatens to go clean off the
end of the keyboard—-and his sense of
rhythm in an evening which included the
lively Sonata in B Minor, a couple of
the polonaises and a glittering shower of
preludes, nocturnes, studies and waltzes.
* * * *
Luck still sticks to Hector Crawford,
the young conductor who first popularised
open-air concerts in the Melbourne
Botanic Gardens. Although surrounded
on both sides by frightful weather, the
first Sunday concert of the season spon-
sored by the State Government was
smiled on by glorious sunshine. The
ducks quacked on the lake, the feet of
the multitude crunched the gravel of the
paths, the trees rustled in the gentle
zephyr and some of the music was heard
by some of the 20,000 sitting or standing
on the grass with a more or less un-
interrupted view of the performers.
Among the items rendered by the Mel-
bourne Conservatorium Orchestra was
the Bridal March and Finale from “The
Music of the Birds” by Aristophanes,
written by Hubert Parry, the one chosen
by Dr, W. N. McKie, one-time of Mel-
bourne, for the Royal wedding. The
local birds provided an obbligato and the
human audience rapturously applauded.

Queensland radio was well represented
in the Brisbane Repertory’s production
of “Petrified Forest,” Robert Sherwood’s
blend of gangsters and machine-guns with
philosophy and poetry. A.B.C.’s Dion
Wheeler was guest producer and Mervyn
Eadie (in the Howard part), Franklyn
Evans, Betty Ross and Bill Neilson are
all radio players. As the chief gangster,
Crawford Tomlinson did good work. He
was neither the overdone Chicago version
of fourth-rate films, nor the equally
absurd Australian version of the tough
egg. He was tough and a gangster —but
believable.
Contemporary Art Show.
A detailed description of all the 233
pictures in the Contemporary Art
Society’s exhibition at the Education
Department’s Gallery, Sydney, would be
formidable —and melancholy. In quality
the pictures, paintings and drawings alike,
range from the mildly competent through
a fair swathe of mediocrity to the great
bulk of the exhibition, which can only be
described as inadequate. There are red
pictures, yellow pictures, black pictures
and some which defy any reasonable
definition.
James Cowie’s “High Yaller” is, oddly,
predominately red and, in its Dobell-
influenced and caricature-like direction,
not a bad impression of a female pro-
duct of miscegenation, with a perky hat.
It is far better than Keith Harrison’s
“Timeless Land,” a vividly chromatic
wonder, with blasted and improbable
tree stumps and sheets of crimson
descending disconcertingly from the sky.
The work of painters like Orban, Mar-
garet Olley and Jean Bellette —all of
whom are capable of better painting —
is insufficiently represented in this exhibi-
tion. A note of relief is given by two
sketches, one in color, the other in black
and white, by Rah Fizelle, but apart
from these the work is generally poor.
There are a number of “straight” paint-
ings in the dreariest academic style.
Cesare Vagarini’s “Still Life,” a fine
collection of realistic but lifeless fish, was
bought by the N. S. Wales Gallery for
the Marshall Bequest. Another pur-
chase by the local gallery was F. C.
Hinder’s drawing of a young woman with
her head in her hands and her hands on
her knees, a drawing which at least had
some quality of line.*

Rodin said that sculpture was the art
of the hole and the lump, and in his show
at the Velasquez Galleries, Melbourne,
Joseph Mason seems to be following his
dictum. He works in jarrah, mountain
ash, blackwood, cedar and alabaster and
his forms are ostensibly human beings.
What he puts into the forms is quite
monotonous and lifeless. The quality of
the line in his “Family Group” in jarrah
is as conventional as they make ’em,
though the shapes are eccentric. His
“Kneeling Girl,” done in blackwood,
suffers from an acute lack of observation
and his “Reclining Figure” suggests an
anchor shackle,

Melbourne National Gallery has
coughed up another roomful of its minor
treasures in a series of aquatints of bull-
fights by Goya. They are extraordinary
achievements which would give even a
professional slaughterman the horrors
and make a horselover want to vomit.
Unlike most “contemporary” artists who
paint horrific subjects they can’t feel
because they only know them by descrip-
tion and not acquaintance. Goya depicted
things with Which he had very direct
acquaintance. He was probably the only
painter in history who earned his living
by being a bullfighter.

AND IT'S
RED MILL RUM.
Only two greys have won the Melbourne
Cup, between them spanning almost the whole
history of the race. The first was Toryboy,
an aged gelding who downed the favorite,
Panic, in 1865—the fifth running of the race.
That year the trophy was a “piece of plate,’
and the added money £2OO. This year con-
nections of the grey four-year-old Nizami geld-
ing Hiraji collected £7OOO plus a £3OO gold
cup.
A heavy track on the traditional first Tuesday
of November boded ill for the heavyweight
brigade, and the promising three-year-6ld Fresh
Boy, with 6.11, replaced Proctor as favorite.
Anxious to avoid repetition of bis experience
in the Caulfield Cup, when forced to travel at
least four horses wide nearly all the way, young
Eames on Fresh Boy stuck tenaciously to the
rails, but none of the luck of the running came
his way. With Royal Scot acting as pacemaker,
Purtell moved Hiraji up handy to the leaders
early in the piece and maintained this good
position until the moment came to “go for it”
in the straight. After striking bother several
times on the way round Fresh Boy issued the
only serious challenge to Hiraji nearing the
post, but, as in the Caulfield Cup, the grey
safely held him; a half-length to Fresh Boy,
two lengths to Red Fury and next Proctor,
doing well to finish fourth with his 9st.
If ever a horse were destined to win a Mel-
bourne Cup it was Hiraji, whose ill-luck was
becoming proverbial through his unbelievable
sequence of minor placings in rich races. By
the same token, had he won any of those
races he’d have carried a lot more than 7.11
in the Cup, and on the heavy track may not
have been up to beating the feather-weighted
Fresh Boy. In issuing his weights for the
Hotham the handicapper showed that he was
fairly itching to re-assess Hiraji for the Cup.
Bred in New Zealand, Hiraji was the first foal
out of the Foxbridge mare Duvach, and thus
comes of the most successful blood in New
Zealand at present. Himself the winner of
good races in England, including the Liverpool
Atlantic Cup, Foxbridge has headed the N.Z.
winning-sire list for seven successive seasons.
Hiraji’s sire, the grey Nizami, is a son of the
Pharos horse Firdaussi (a St. Leger winner)
and the “flying filly” Mumtaz Mahal, by The
Tetrarch. Mumtaz Mahal, who fetched over
9000 guineas as a yearling, justified the price
in her racing career; she has been described
as the fastest filly in the history of the turf.
As hard as nails and seeming to thrive on
work, Hiraji has been solidly raced throughout
his career, with few let-ups. He was as fresh
as a daisy after his Cup win, being reported
to have celebrated by kicking his float to
pieces on the way home from the course.
Hiraji did his two-year-old racing in New
Zealand, winning three events and running
Majesty to a neck in the Auckland Champagne
Stakes. Bought then by F. W. Hughes for
2000 guineas, he has raced since in Australia.
As a three-year-old, Hiraji had 23 starts for
five wins and eight minor placings, including
third in the Doomben Ten Thousand, and
second in the Doomben Cup. The Melbourne
Cup was his first success as a four-year-old,
and prior to it he had run second in the
King’s Cup in Brisbane, third in the Theo
Marks Quality Handicap (Sydney), and in Mel-
bourne third in the Toorak Handicap, second
in the Caulfield Cup and second in the Hotham
Handicap.
Prepared for the Cup by one-time jockey
J. W. McCurley, who has the handling of
most of Hughes’s horses, Hiraji ran the two
miles in 3.28 —very slow as Cup times go these
days. Blue Spec ran better time as far back
as 1905, and since then the Cup record has
been whittled down to the 3.21}, shared by
Wotan and Russia. Colonus took 3.33} five
years ago.
First past the post last year on Russia,
D. Munro this year finished last on the
Metrop. winner Murray Stream. Darby was
credited with the ingenuous remark “He just
got tired, so I eased him up.”
F. W. Hughes also had a great spin in
Melbourne with another grey Nizami, the three-
year-old filly Nizam’s Ring. When last in
training Nizam’s Ring failed to strike her known
form, but this time up it’s been four starts for
four wins. Kicking off in Sydney with the
Flight Stakes, the filly went south to take
in succession the One Thousand Guineas, the
Wakeful Stakes and the Oaks. Some considered
her lucky to win the Oaks, in which, too late
to switch to the outside with any hope of
success, her rider, E. Swinton, found himself
blocked on the rails. Swinton stuck there, hoping
for the best, and fortunately a timely opening
enabled the filly to get through and just beat
Saxony and Jalna. The close third of Jalna
was a surprise over the mile-and-a-half journey.
Neither Cup nor Oaks winner is much to
look at, the filly being particularly plain. Of
a blotchy light-grey color, Hiraji is small but
compact and solid enough. Nizam’s Ring is
slighter; in color she is a singularly dark and
dirty grey, lightening off somewhat towards the
chest and head. She is a daughter of Ringless,
by Ringmaster from Damaris, a winner of the
Great Northern Oaks in New Zealand.
Altogether Sydney visitors collected some
£26,500 over the two Cup meetings. The bulk
of it went to Hiraji, Nizam’s Ring and, more
impressive than ever, Columnist. On Oaks
day Columnist took the mile Linlithgow Stakes,
downing Royal Gem and Victory Lad, with
Attley an utter disappointment over what is
considered his pet distance. Taking no harm
from the run, Columnist turned out again on
Saturday to beat Russia and Money Moon over
the 12 furlongs of the C. B. Fisher Plate.
Standing out as the class horse of Australia
today, five-year-old Columnist has now won a
total of £16,182 in stakes—more than half of
it in Melbourne over the past month!
Another excellent performance at Flemington
on Saturday was that of Wandilow, account-
ing for Britisher and Robert Bruce in the
V.R.C. Handicap of 14 furlongs. A surprising
feature of the race was the backing of Amelia
to close second favoritism. On recent form
she appeared to have about as much chance
as the Cain Government. Clocking 2.55},
Wandilow knocked three-parts of a second off
First Acre’s course record established 17 years
back.

Jockeys, particularly, seem to get their ups
and downs of racing in spasms. Purtell, with
the Melbourne Cup up his sleeve, has been
having a great spin. On Saturday he had a
mount in each of the six flat races and re-
turned four winners, a second and a third. He
was on Russia in Columnist’s race, and on
Star of India finished third behind Fine Fettle
and Nagation in the Final Handicap of 10
furlongs. As well, he won the Club Handicap
on Wandilow; the Batman Stakes for three-
year-olds on Cronides, beating Rio Fe and
Leonatus; the Flemington Stakes, in which
Amritsar proved too hot for Alabama King,
Mile End and other two-year-old colts and
geldings; and the Ottawa Stakes for two-year-
old fillies on Chosen.

At Rosehill on Saturday the McCarten stable,
with N. Sellwood as usual doing the riding,
provided a strange contrast in winners, beginning
with the fine-looking Dhoti colt Phalanx in
the Maiden for two-year-old colts and geldings.
Phalanx was the popular choice at 10 to 9 on,
and paid a shade better than evens on the
tote. Later the stable took the second Mixed
Stakes (7f.) with Lucky Duke, downing Waricia
and Hava Chat. The books had the Duke at
100 to 1; those who put a speculative five bob
into the win tote were returned £63 Is.
Another Duke was successful in a Mixed
over 10 furlongs, Royal Duke (J. Thompson)
just shading the repeatedly unlucky Menelik
and King Lear. The first seven-furlongs Mixed
saw Beau Robert (E. Cracknell) add to the
very small number of horses who have won
these events carrying the maximum of 9st.
Strathdarr (T. Mullane), Pigeon Pie and The
Diver all seemed rather out of their class in
the Flying (for which Tynedale was favorite),
but they filled the places in that order.
The Rosehill Handicap of 10 furlongs attracted
only seven runners and gave Silent (F. Walker)
a very easy win from Crusader and Cisco.
Quite the most exciting race was the nine-
furlongs Welter, in which six of the eight
runners hit the finish in a solid bunch, just
headed by Euryalus (T. Mullane), Haymarket
and Coronation Lad. The two-year-old maiden
fillies event went to Huarette (G. Moore), a
very easy winner.
* * * *
Carrying weight-for-age of 7.6 in the Queens-
land Cup, the Derby winner Sefiona was well
beaten by two older horses, both receiving
weight from the youngster. After being left
at the start, Few Words gradually made up
ground to join Don’s Fort for a great battle
down the straight. Few Words scored by a
neck, with eight lengths to Sefiona. A six-year-
old mare by Mr. Standfast from Wise Lady,
Few Words clocked 3.21 L equalling the race
record, though the course and Australian record
is Spear Chief’s remarkable 3.19 J.

Despite missing out on the major prizes,
F. W. Hughes finished up leading owner in
Australia last season, with £20,656 in stakes.
Australia’s biggest individual supporter of
racing (more than 100 horses are now carrying
his red-and-white check colors), Hughes has
this season collected £12,325 over the two Cup
meetings in Melbourne alone. In other States
his horses have bagged the best part of another
£5OOO, including a couple of contributions from
yet another of the grey Nizami breed, Grey
Nurse. Hughes was also on top for the 1944-45
season, with a mere £13,427.

Indian tour:
Rain washed the India v. Victoria match off
M.C.G.; the third successive drawn game for
the Indians. Victoria had 2 for 138 out of
334 required. W. Johnston bagged 6 for 96
and lan Johnson 6 for 165.
Warmer weather bucked up the Indian players
for the match v. N.S.W. on Friday, but, win-
ning the toss, the locals piled up 387 for four
wickets and next day made it 561 for 8 wickets
(closed). Morris plugged along stolidly till he
passed the but later hit out (one a
sixer) before he was caught near the fence
for 162, his highest score in first-class cricket.
Six bowlers were tried; left-hander Mankad
(3 for 156) and slow right-hander Amir Elahi
(3 for 175) did most of the work. The
visitors’ fielding was patchy, but they are triers
throughout. At the end of play on Saturday
India had lost 4 for 182. Mankad (67, out
to a ball off his foot) and Hazare (78 not out)
handled the bowling well, particularly the
trickiness of Toshack, who was bowled far
too long. The Indian bats faced up fairly
well to the fast bowling of Lindwall and
Miller. The scoring of 387 on the first day
and 356 on the second gave customers some-
thing for their silver.
Form of W. Johnston, Loxton and 19-year-old
N- Harvey (Vic.) has won them a trial with
the Australian XI v. India at Sydney this
week; the others in the team are Bradman
(capt.), Hamence and Dooland (S.A.), Brown
and Rex Rogers (Q ), K. Miller and Saggers
(N.S.W.), and M. Herbert (W.A.), who got 7
for 45 v. India at Perth.
Victoria hit up 360 for five wickets v. South
Aus. at Adelaide on Friday; Hassett (A.I.F.
captain) 118 and Merv Harvey 89. Qp Satur-
day the other five wickets added 80 runs and
the innings closed at 440. Fothergill, an im-
proving batsman, got 102, pushing his
claims for a place in international cricket.
At the close of play on Saturday S.A. had
202 on the board for two wickets, mainly
Bradman (100, out l.b.w. to I. Johnson) and
Craig (80 not out). It was Bradmans 99th
century in first-class cricket, and his second
this season; the other, 156 v. India.

The Wallabies beat Hampshire-Sussex
14-5 in a patchy game. Emery (five-
eighth), Broad (inside-centre) and Allan
(outside-centre) all had an off day, giving
Walker and Tonkin —who are developing
into a formidable pair of wingers—few
chances. In the absence of Eastes, Walker
seems likely to hold his position for the
first big game, Macßride, on his Aus-
tralian form, being a brilliant opportunist
in attack but notoriously weak at de-
fence. Emery, on his Australian form a
rather stodgy player, at least left no
doubts of his defending ability, and in
recent games in England has been pene-
trating well. Kraefft, one of the least
spectacular of the forwards, is a good
solid second-row man, and
now seems at the top of his
form. With Windon back,
after suspension over the
Llanelly brawl, the Austra-
lian pack should be the best
available.
* * *
“H.H.” (Lond.): In nearly
40 years Colin Windon was
only the third player of an
Australasian side ordered
off. The others were in
1925—a New Zealander —
and 1908 —an Australian ;
both were forwards. In his
fine book Viewless Winds,
Dr. (“Paddy”) Moran de-
scribed that Australian for-
ward as a splendid all-round
athlete and a good sports-
man, but liable to be im-
petuous. In a match against
Oxford the forward hit out
at a tall Devonian and was
immediately ordered off.
Being sent off was taken
very much to heart those
times, and the impetuous
chap suffered contrition for
long afterwards ; but years
later he settled in London, and often met
on the best of terms the man he had
struck.

Ron Mcßae (10.11) and Kev Mc-
Carthy (11.4) let loose lots of action at
Leichhardt. McCarthy, looking about
twice the size of Mcßae, fought aggres-
sively enough, but Mcßae’s snappy
straight lefts kept crashing on the Mc-
Carthy konk, and Mcßae won nine of
the first 10 rounds. Moreover, Mcßae
outboxed McCarthy in the last two
rounds. Referee Mawson called this a
draw.
* * * *
Mickey Tollis (9.8 i) showed out
further as the best of the lightweights now
in action by wearing Roy Treasure (same
weight) to his knees in the 10th round
of their Melbourne Stadium clash.
Treasure’s gameness made a solid fight of
it, but the southpaw was down sundry
times and was worn out at the finish.
Maybe the overdone southpaw fashion
will begin to wane.


When there is NO WILL
THE LAW DIRECTS HOW YOUR
ESTATE SHALL BE DISTRIBUTED
IF you do not make a Will—a
privilege that is usually an ob-
ligation as well—the division made
by law may not be as you would
have made it and may nof be satis-
factory to your dependents.
For example :
If you die intestate (that is,
without a Will), leaving a widow
and young children, two thirds of
the Capital of your Estate is auto-
matically locked up until the
children come of age.
If 'you are childless and die intes-
tate your widow does not receive
the full benefit of your Estate, being
entitled by law only to the first
£l,OOO thereof and one half of the
balance, the other half passing to
your own relations.
Whatever your wish you should
have it clearly expressed in a Will
that has been drawn by a solicitor.
Do not on any account draw the
Will yourself.
Of the utmost importance in the
making of a Will is the choice of
an Executor who is to administer
the Estate. Upon his trustworthiness
and ability your beneficiaries will be
entirely dependent.
There is a helpful and informa-
tive booklet, “Your Executor and
Trustee,” which describes the ser-
vice Perpetual Trustee Company
Limited renders to the Community
in this and other capacities. It gives

Prices Up or Down?
One of the problems confronting any-
one thinking of buying enduring goods
or property for an outlay of consider-
able money these times is the question of
whether the motor-car, furniture, home,
building block or whatever it may be* will
be dearer or cheaper later on. «Business-
men wanting to replace or add to their
factory plant, buildings or equipment are
faced with the same difficulty.
There are three major factors con-
tributing to the acute price and cost
situation of the present time. The first is
the lag in output of civil goods that
started when factories, farms, etc., were
destroyed or thrown over to munitions-
production during the war. The second
is the enormous (inflationary) amount of
money (spending-power) that was created
during and since the war regardless of
the amount of consumer goods produced
at the same time. The third is the fall
in production per man-hour and per week
since 1939, a state of affairs that (in Aus-
tralia) has been caused by deliberate “go
slow,” by misdirection of labor, by dis-
organisation of supply sources and by
the introduction of 40-hour weeks and
the like.
Important influences in the price of raw
materials are supply and demand, and,
in the price of manufactured goods,
wages costs, usually based on living costs.
There has been no noticeable slacken-
ing in the pressure on costs and prices
in Australia even though war has been
over for more than two years. The
common thing has been for further in-
creases, and, when the 40-hour week be-
comes general throughout the Common-
wealth in 1948, we may expect still greater
rises in production costs unless wage-
earners reverse a previous tendency and
decide to do as much work in 40 hours
as they have done hitherto in 44.
Australian indexes of prices and costs
were still rising in the third quarter of
this year. Though wool and wheat were
fetching more, costs of things imported
were mounting, too. In almost every
country of the world, some Middle East
States and Czechoslovakia excepted (in
the latter country the cost of food
doubled in 1946, and restraining measures
now appear to be in force), prices are
rising steadily, and with them the cost of
living. There is no evidence in statistics
that prices have reached their maximum
except in countries where inflation has
already had its head and multiplied price
indexes. In the United States, where pro-
duction momentum has been largely re-
gained, there has been a steadying in
some prices lately, but demand is still
huge.
In Australia in June the cost of living
was estimated at about 33 p.c. above
1939 rates. In Britain the rise was com-
puted at 30 p.c., Canada 33 p.c.,' the
United States 53 p.c., Switzerland 59 p.c.,
South Africa 40 p.c., Sweden 53 p.c, and
New Zealand 25 p.c.
In a number of these countries the cost
of living is subsidised, especially in
Britain and Australia. The real rise in
living costs has been much greater than
indicated. Price-control operates still in
Britain, New Zealand and Canada as
well as Australia and some other coun-
tries ; but in Chile, Brazil, Bolivia,
Mexico, Paraguay and Peru, none of
which was closely engaged in the recent
war, living costs have at least doubled,
and sometimes multiplied. The Argentine,
and Uruguay have kept inflation in costs
to about 70 p.c. In Ireland the inflation
has been of the order of 75 p.c.
Price-control and subsidies in Australia
have produced many fictions in our living
costs. Wheat for home consumption is
bought at about a quarter of the export
price. Butter is subsidised, and the home
price is far below world parity. Potatoes
and tea are subsidised, and wool made
into clothing goes to the manufacturer at
below ruling rates. Lead and spelter used
in the building industry and elsewhere are
sold in Australia by the Barrier mines at
around a quarter of the world price, and
copper and tin also paid for at below
world parity.
Looking back over the Australian
scene to before World War I we find that
between 1914 and September, 1939, the
cost of living rose by 33 p.c., or a third.
Actually the rise up to 1920 was greater,
and living costs were higher in 1928 than
they were in 1939, the depression inter-
vening. But it is to be noted that, great
though the slump was in the early
19305, Australia never again saw living
costs so low as they were in 1914. The
inflation that accompanied the financing
of the 1914-18 conflict set new standards
of prices and costs for all the world.
There was much greater credit inflation
in 1939-45.
We may reasonably assume, however
unpalatable the idea, that the same thing
has happened again, and that the cost of
building a brick house, for example, will
never return to within cooee of what was
a.Tair thing in 1939. Building costs have
doubled over the past eight years in spite
of “controls” over prices of many build-
ing components, and only greater labor
efficiency will cause much reduction.
During the latest war The Bulletin
frequently expressed the opinion that
price-control, however well administered,
would only delay the effects of war-time
inflation in this country unless new tech-
niques and a smoother intermeshing of all
industries resulted in a greater output per
man-hour, the greater output building up
to the point where it would offset the
obvious and great expansion in spending-
power established by inflationary war-
time finance.
We have seen no general improvement
per man-hour. On the contrary, in many
industries there has been a heavy fall,
and scarcity of goods is still the rule. An
excess of money continues to be created.
The exchange rate between Australia
and other countries is also misleading.
An Australian pound will buy much more
in the way of food and clothing, as a
general thing, in the Commonwealth than
it will in Britain, the United States or
Canada. This currency undervaluation
makes it possible for producers of wheat,
for example, to offset losses on home-con-
sumption grain, as they get more Aus-
tralian pounds for the dollar or sterling
proceeds of their export surplus than they
would if our currency were nearer its
purchasing-power parity overseas.
The governor of the Commonwealth
Bank has pointed out that the total
accumulated spending-power in the hands
of Australians has risen from £613 million
in June, 1939, to £1541 million at June 30
this year. That is a proportionate in-
crease' far exceeding what happened in
1914-18. Savings-bank deposits in the
1939-47 period alone rose from £246
million to £661 million.
In nearly every country in the world
this redundancy of money exists. There
is great paper-money prosperity set
alongside inadequate production of goods
and services.
Freed from all controls, it is certain
that there would be a sharp rise in many
prices in Australia at the present time,
spending-power being so greatly in excess
of available production. In the United
States, where production is now exceed-
ing pre-war levels in many key industries,
prices rose by about 21 p.c. following
the abandonment of controls.
Regarding the great inflation in our
spending-power reserves, H. T. Armitage,
of the Commonwealth Bank, said re-
cently :
Our own problems are very similar to
those which confront other countries, where
spending-power has also been created in
excess of the supply of goods. It is some-
times said that the only solution to excess
spending-power is greater production. But
we need to consider exactly what we mean
by “greater production.” It is true that
greater production, in the sense of a larger
volume of output, will increase the quantity
of available goods, but if it also increases
the income of producers it will add to avail-
able spending-power. The important thing
is clearly to increase production, in terms,
of quantities of goods, more than incomes
are increased. This means, broadly, that
the problem is not only, or perhaps even
mainly, one of greater aggregate production,
but also of greater production per man-
hour.
Whilst the Federal Government continues
to follow a policy of “full employment”
based on Budget-deficit finance, and the
trade-union movement as a body main-
tains an attitude of minimum production
(as with coal), the inflation menace will
remain, and there will be no prospect
of anything but a continued rise in the
price-level until that trend violently con-
flicts with overseas experience, in which
case a slump would bring a sharp and
distressing reaction.
Summed up, the world position shows
that there is as yet no sign of a re-
action in prices, costs in most countries
continuing to rise and production, of
raw materials particularly, remaining in-
adequate. There are surplus stocks of
coarse wools, but fine wool is in keen
request. The unsatisfied demand for
food, clothing and building materials is
enormous still, and, as the United States
price-level continues to rise, its influence
on other countries’ prices should be
an inflationary one. Europe is still in
need of great material assistance, which
adds to the demand for goods of many
kinds, and the United States will probably
pay for much of the assistance. One
good, productive season in Europe might
reverse the trend of food prices, but that
season has yet to put in an appearance.
Within Australia there is nothing what-
ever to indicate that living costs are
likely to fall much over the next two
years. All indicators are for higher costs.
The Federal Government appears to be
wedded to a policy of full employment
based on the creation of money rather
than production, and the 40-hour week
will further restrain the production
machine. Motives revealed behind the
nationalisation of banking “plan” would
increase the gap between production
and spending-power. Whilst the housing
shortage is so acute the high cost
of home-making is bound to continue,
the rate of construction having fallen
deplorably as a result of trade-union
policy. Only the threat of loss of jobs
is likely to bring bricklayers, etc., to
their senses: and there appears to be
plenty of work available to the trade
for years yet.
Queensland Coal
“8.T.U.”: R. W. Foot, chairman of
Powell Duffryn, British technical ad-
visers on coal, blinked comet-like into
Queensland coalfields and out again. He
had scarcely left the 20ft. coking seam
at Collinsville before he was peering at the
reputed 50ft. seam yi the Callide Valley
and its supposed 50 million tons of coal.
And then the plan was laid before the
Queensland Premier. Mr. Foot, who
exudes an air of super-efficiency and
urbanity, brilliantly sold Mr. Hanlon an
idea for which the taxpayers will foot
the bill in instalments of £3OOO to £4OOO
each month indefinitely. It will be ser-
viced by British technicians, whereas
Australians could have done all the pre-
liminary work regarding the survey and
report on the coal resources of the State.
If the Premier had put a team on,
headed by the State coal engineer and
geologist, with a drill or two and £3OO,
not £3OOO, per month, and were the coal
tests made by the technical services of the
C.S.I.R. (an Australian institution) in-
stead of sending the test lots to Britain,
the stage would have been cheaply set up
for the British firm to introduce the
latest overseas advances in processing of
coal and mechanisation of collieries. Mr.
Foot has been a little too laudatory in
his remarks on the coal and the fields.
There were too few qualifications, such
as the considerable degree of Mother
Earth in Bowen coke or the relatively
moderate calorific efficiency of Callide
coal. Enthusiasm was the keynote of the
proceedings, and it carried negotiations
to a successful conclusion.

The Manufacturing Industry
Factory output in Australia, in terms
of depreciating money, rose very con-
siderably after 1939. In 1945-46 the
value of production was £354.3 million,
an increase of £150.9 million (74.2 p.c.)
over the corresponding figure for 1938-
39. “Value of production” is a term used
by the Commonwealth Statistician to in-
dicate the value added to raw materials,
etc., by processing in factories, and does
not include values created before the
items to be processed are brought into
the plant. The “all-up” value of output,
including initial costs, has risen from
£500.4 million in 1938-39 to £869.8 mil-
lion in 1945-46 —again an increase of
74 p.c.
The war year 1943-44 set the record
for Australian factory production, which
was valued at £366.2 million. That was
also a year of record national income,
as computed from statistics. But it was
a time of mushroom growth in industry
because of the demands of war; there
was a great deal of waste and misdirec-
tion in munitions-manufacturing at that
point, and production “values” of the
period are better regarded as “costs.”
The standard of living in Australia at the
time was at about its lowest level; war
and waste made heavy drains upon the
people.
Latest factory statistics available apply
to the year 1945-46. When 1946-47 re-
sults are issued it will probably be seen
that the decline from the peak set in
1943-44 has been arrested. Most
“national-income” figures are now mov-
ing up, and factory employment is in-
creasing.
The setback that the value of factory
“output” and “production” suffered after
the peak year has not been because
of any decline in male employment. A
record number of men are now on pay-
rolls. But women voluntarily or com-
pulsorily engaged in munitions work de-
clined in number in 1945-46. During
1946-47, only employment figures for
which are yet available, the total num-
ber of hands engaged was a record.
The average annual income for each
employee reached its highest point during
1943-44. This was because of the large
amount of overtime then being paid.
Since then (up to June, 1946), notwith-
standing a higher percentage of male
workers on payrolls, there has been a
fall in the level of earnings. The in-
creased basic wage and the introduction
of the 40-hour week (to become general
in 1948) will no doubt result in average
pay rising considerably^
It can be seen from the inflation in
average pay already—from £196 6s. a
year for each factory employee in 1938-
39 to £291 3s. in 1943-44, with a reces-
sion to £285 3s. in 1945-46 —that higher
operating costs have had a good deal to
do with the rise in value of Australian
factory production during the war and
post-war years. What the actual increase
in factory production has been, mea-
sured in volume, it is extremely difficult
to guess. One thing is certain: the
average output per head has fallen by
comparison with pre-war experience, and
the 792,600 persons now engaged in fac-
tory work (excluding working pro-
prietors) are not pulling their weight to
the extent that the 542,200 were doing
before the war, even though the expan-
sion in factory activity should have meant
more mass-production and a greater per-
capita output.
Australian manufacturing is plainly
still waiting to consolidate the advantages
that came its way as a result of the war.
A good standard of quality has been
established in many types of products,
and a wide market exists for almost any-
thing in the way of food, clothing,
mechanical articles or building materials.
Much now depends upon the Prices
Branch, upon the Federal Government’s
general attitude towards private enter-
prise, upon company taxation and —most
important of all —upon industrial morale.
As soon as healthy output per man-hour
is re-established competition will attend
to any deficiencies in management that
may exist.
Whispers of a merger between Korma
Textiles (N.Z.), Ltd., and Felt and Tex-
tiles of Australia, Ltd., materialised at
the end of October in the purchase of all
Korma’s issued ord. shares by the Aus-
tralian concern. Korma’s directors in
Auckland, pleased with the deal, de-
clared: “This association will have many
advantages for our mills, as Felt and
Textiles is the source of some of the
principal raw materials.” Korma Textiles
was formed last year to buy out Korma
Mills, Ltd., and launch a big new project
on a 20-acre site at Royal Oak, an Auck-
land suburb, where outerwear-knitting
plant swung into operation last summer.
Spinning of worsted yarn will be an
activity of this factory when fully work-
ing. Korma’s issued capital is £250,000,
in equal numbers of pref, and ord. shares.
Ords. include £75,000 allotted to buy
Korma Mills, Ltd., and £50,000 taken for
cash by the vendors of Korma Mills.
Before this move Felt and Textiles of
Australia had a strong foothold in Maori-
land’s textile field through its controlling
interest in Felt and Textiles of N.Z.,
Ltd. Now the merger dominates M.L.’s
young textile industry.
Offshoot of an Australian enterprise,
Korma Textiles (N.Z.), Ltd., is in the
midst of an expansion programme
launched last year, and is building up out-
put as it goes along. As plant arrives from
overseas it is put into operation. Sales were
£460,839 for the year ended March, and
profits were £13,916, after meeting depre-
ciation and taxation —the first accounts
since the concern was converted into a
public company. Pref, dividend of 5 p.c.
was paid, but there’s no return yet for
ord. shareholders. With subsidiaries, net
profit was £27,325. When 125,0Q0 prefer-
ence shares were offered to the public in
May, 1946, applications were eight to one
in two hours.

Maoriland’s gold-export tax of 12s. 6d.
an ounce is to go. It may not happen
immediately, perhaps not until early next
year, but the big gold-dredging companies
operating on the west coast of the South
Island have been given the hint that re-
lief is coming. They are putting the yard-
stick on borderline claims with prospects
of profit. Dredging concerns have been
battling against rising costs, which have
narrowed dividend yields. The war tax
of 225. lOd. an ounce, imposed in 1939
as a gold-export charge, was lifted last
year, but there’s a much longer history
behind the 12s. 6d. Its exit will give an-
other lease of life to M.L.’s oldest and
richest mine, owned by the Martha Gold
Co., at Waihi, where low-grade ore is
extensively worked, lately on a precarious
basis. M.L.’s gold exports have been
slipping over the last couple of years
and are now running below £lOO,OOO a
month. In 1944 they reached £1,423,556
for the year. The 1946 value was
£1,184,783, and M.L. will do well if it
can hold that figure. So it is clear that
the gold industry needs a help along.
* * * *
From 1941 to June 30, 1945, losses by
the Federal Government on its operation
of requisitioned ships totalled £5,857,490.
There have been further heavy losses in
the two years since.


ABORIGINALITIES
“Old-timer”; We were camped in
Curly Robertson’s hut out on Etiwanda-
avenue, Mildura, waiting for the apricot-
picking, when Dutch came in one night
and in awed tones said, “Was cross in’
the 70ft. channel up near Fourteenth
[l4th-street] when there’s a swirl in the
water. Gripes, must be a cod there big
as a flamin’ whale.” Next day we ex-
amined the channel, then running a full
head of water, and Dutch set haif a dozen
night lines. Nothing happened. Four
nights later he reported the swirl again,
this time catching a white flash as
the fish turned over. “Big as a house,”
he asserted. The following Sunday we
dragged that section of the 70ft. with
netting, but caught nothing better than
a 21b. catfish. Dutch’s powers of obser-
vation, imagination and description were
caustically criticised. He took it all and
merely concentrated on preparing a gelig-
nite bomb to* stiffen that fish. Then for
three nights he prowled the channel.
On the fourth he came in, disgusted.
“Saw the big cow again,” he snorted ;
“whizzed the bomb in but the flamin’
thing didn’t go off!” He set about mak-
ing another. But before he could use
it we ran into old Edwards in the Settlers’
Club and were invited to an expedition.
“Me two little girls go swimmin’ at
night sometimes,” he said, “an’ a coupler
times some bloke come along an’ they
had to get under the willows quick.
The other night he starts heavin’ rocks
at ’em. I was wonderin’ if you blokes
would gimme a hand t’ catch him at it.”
As the pale and shaking Dutch called for
drinks we solemnly agreed to patrol the
channel.
* * * *
“E. 2”: The cove on the place behind
Dan’s has about 50-acres of scrub and
ringbarked timber, on which he runs half
a dozen scrubber cows and ekes out a
sort of a living with as many rusted
rabbit-traps. Dan, sorely pressed for
labor, took pity on him and put him on
a job grubbing stumps at £1 a day. Ben
stuck it for four days before deciding his
back was crook. He called on Dan for
his money, dropping the information that
he was heading to the township for some
liniment. Dan, knowing from experience
what the “liniment” would be, grinned
and dug out his cheque-book. “I’d like
it in cash, if y’ don’t mind,” Ben said.
Dan goggled at him. “Think me cheque
might bounce, eh?” he inquired belliger-
ently. “No, it ain’t that,” Ben apologised.
“I know you’re all right, Dan. But y’
know how it is with things these days.
When I git a few bob on the side I keep
it dark. Gripes, if it got round that I
earned that money the income-tax blokes
’d be down on me like a ton o’ bricks! ”
* * * *
“Goldie”: We were camped at Wild
Goat Creek on a promising reef-show
and had to rely on the mailman to bring
rations and supplies once a week. The
fresh stuff was used up early in the week
and we seldom had much laid by in the
way of provisions. One Wednesday after-
noon, after a couple of days on damper
and cocky’s joy, we sent Tom on ahead
to the camp to await the mailman’s com-
ing and prepare a decent meal. That
evening we lined up to large juicy slices
of grilled steak, fried eggs and potato-
chips, topped off with fresh bread and
butter and apricot jam. Tom munched
his' much less voraciously than usual.
“Ain’t y’ hungry?” Harry asked. “Well,
me appetite has gom orf a bit,” Tom
admitted. “The smell of this stuff cookin’
made me feel so damn’ hungry that I
had t’ have somethin’ t’ keep me goin’,”
He indicated the minor remnant of a
loaf and a ravaged pound of butter.
“Must be sumthin’ in the yarn about
light snacks between meals puttin’ y’ orf
yT tucker,” he added®
* * * *
“Blime”: Dan spotted the new valuer
across the street and made for him.
“That block o’ mine I’m sellin’,” he be-
gan affably. “Hear y* was out t’ look at
it the other day. Did she make the price
I’m askin’?” “How could it?” laughed
the other scornfully. “No improvements,
and most of it is covered with heavy
green timber,” “Too right it is,” agreed
Dan. “Two thousand quid’s worth o’
timber there if there’s a stick. An’ I’m
sellin’ as she stands.” “Yes,” the other
grunted, “but you could never get it out.
How could you market” “Gripes,
that ain’t your worry,” Dan pointed out.
“You admit it’s there, don’t y’?” “Yes,'
but... oh, well, apart from that, the
only corner with any grass is just alive
with rabbits.” Dan nodded enthusiasti-
cally. “An’ did y’ see the price o’ skins?”
he chuckled. “I bet there’s another
thousand clear, just waitin’ t’ be cashed.
And then there’s the bonuses for the
dingoes an’ wombats —they’re worth quite
bit. I tell y’, the assets on that place’ll
more ’n cover its purchase price, then the
buyer’ll git the block for nothing. Now,
if that ain’t cheap, you tell me!”
* * * *
“B. A. Ker”: About eight o’clock Tiny,
the 14-stone babbler, broke up the jaded
crib-players with an excited “There’s a
full moon up and the eels are cornin’ over
“I Wonder what our NEXT keeper Will be like ?”
the bar in droves!” Few things could
have offered greater diversion to a group
of hut-weary men. The fastest runners
got the hay-forks, two tied for the gar-
den-fork, one compromised for the
spade and the last bloke took a rake. If
Tiny’s statement proved to be an exag-
geration, it was based on truth. Knee-
deep in the swirling water the hunters
prowled, eyes straining in the erratic
light. Occasionally a wild yell would
bring them all converging to the spot
in a spearing, swishing, Splashing melee
that by some miracle did no grievous
bodily harm to the swishers and spearers,
and in about one sortie in ten finished
with a wriggling form being flung up on
the bank, there —when the moonlight
didn’t fade —to be bashed with sundry,
weapons and shoved in the sugar-bag.
When the moon finally vanished and the
rain set in again six men, who couldn’t
have got much wetter, anyway, bolted
for shelter, the leader carrying the bag
of slippery breakfast. But we didn’t
have eel for breakfast after all —nobody
fancied eating ’em after we found, in the
light of the hut lamp, one of the eels
we’d caught so enthusiastically was a
two-foot-six black snake.

“Niloc”: With its ducks the town-
ship’s postmaster shared the ability to
get truly happy when a spell of heavy
rain commenced. Bellowing “Send her
down, Huey!” he would bound out
through the mud in his official capacity
as district rain-recorder to see how things
were progressing in his gauge, and would
later take great pride in reading his re-
ports in the paper, nearly bursting if this
happened to be a record for the day.
Then, after an annual holiday in the city,
he returned a married man. Two days
passed and localised rain started falling
in a manner which would place him, as
a gauge-holder, in world class. His grin
assumed proportions making Joe E.
Brown’s seem purse-like in comparison.
The rain had petered out by the follow-
ing morning, but already his reservoir,
a big jar inside the gauge, was nearly
filled. Trembling, he placed it on his
counter while he went to deliver an
urgent telegram. When he returned the
jar had gone. He found it on the
kitchen table, emptied and having part
of his wife’s first batch of preserved fruit
poured into it. Then occurred the
greatest roar since Krakatoa was in the
business.

“Hep-2-3-4”: To deriate a coasting
marksman, take one sheet of white paper
(large writing-pad size is perfect) and
pin it on a tree ; move back 100 yards
with the crack shot; defy him to hit it.
I’ve seen a group of Diggers—two of
them graded snipers—try this stunt and
place neat three-inch groups all around
the papeP, but not on it. The rifle used
was a brand-new .303 which was after-
wards placed in clamps and found sadly
to be perfectly true. The troops never
discovered what the catch was, but they
blamed the white target area for creat-
ing some sort of optical illusion. A cook
who introduced the phenomenon success-
fully laid odds against anyone hitting the
paper; and, having reaped further gain,
put a hole in it himself. As he was last
seen getting stuck into the lemon essence
the secret probably died with him.
* * * *
“Gravelsnatcher”.: I struck him half-
way up the slope that led to his humpy.
He was resting, and I could see that his
withered old limbs had let him down.
“Dunno,” he said with a grin. “Can’t
seem to make it.” I practically carried
him up the hill, and sat him on his bed.
When I mentioned that I’d drop in again
on my way out from the township he
asked me if I’d get him a bottle of
whisky, and from a bulging wallet he
drew a roll of notes that would have
choked a bull. “Gripes, Pop,” I said.
“Aren’t you scared someone’ll walk in
here some day and take that from you?”
“Let ’em try,” he retorted. And looking
at him then, with his eyes flashing and
his trembling fists half-closed, I realised
why it is that nearly all the worth-while
jobs that have been done in Australia
were initiated before the turn of the
century.
* * * *
“Archaps”: Dr. Frommurze, a visiting
South African geologist, told Queensland
graziers that for the 30 years he has had
charge of the Union’s water department
he has been arguing with water-diviners.
In England he found that almost every
village had its “dowser,” but one could
sink a well in almost any part of England
and get water! In South Africa under-
ground water supplies were practically
unknown, and their discovery depended
on geology, backed up by geophysics ;
therefore the geologists had the upper
hand. Frommurze described Australia’s
great artesian basin as one of the wonders
of the world, and appealed to Australians
to do everything possible to preserve
it, as once it played out he didn’t know
what the back-country would do.
# * * *
“Colonial Cove”: Aboriginal mentality
must have changed considerably if the
hero of “Bridle - track’s” yarn (B.
15/10/’47) arrived back home from his
outing as tribal avenger and punter laden
with “ bright cloths and gewgaws.”
In the early days of Australian settlement
the fact that the aboriginal placed no
value on such articles brought despair to
those sanguine souls who had laid in
stores of looking-glasses and beads, hop-
ing by such to buy his labor. Even the
First Fleet seems to have brought along
a few such gifts, accepted by the grinning
abos, only to be found later discarded in
the bush. Such articles handed out
by hopeful settlers of the Swan River
(W.A.) met a similar reception: even the
gins wouldn’t wear a string of beads
for more than a day. Captain Cook, it
may be recalled, records much the same
experience; beads and gewgaws that
earlier in the voyage had delighted South
Sea islanders remained untouched when
left in native huts at Botany Bay. Actu-
ally Binghi in his primitive state was
the world’s prime realist —a thing pos-
sessed utility, or it did not! If it didn’t
—then why be cumbered with it?
* * * *
“Horseless Horseman”: The bush trait
that dies hardest in a city is one’s un-
conscious habit of looking out for snakes.
Each time I see a likely piece of bark
resembling a longtail or enter the cob-
webby toolshed in my suburban yard I
am always subconsciously at the ready
and sensing where 1 can put my hand
on a waddy. This spring, just as 1 was
exerting a bit of mind psychology to
rid myself of the idea, a fellow was bitten
by a tiger-snake in his backyard at Ivan-
hoe, five miles from Melbourne’s G.P.O.
It looks as if I’ve the habit for good,
« « * «
“Lower Tops’l”: Proof that rabbits
exterminate themselves on small areas,
if left to themselves, comes again from
Christmas Island in the small New Year
Group to the westward of King Island
(Bass Strait). There about 18 years ago
someone —fishermen are suspected, since
the group is the only all-weather anchor-
age off King Island —released some
rabbits. In five years the rodents bred up
to such amazing proportions on the mut-
ton-bird-rookery island that the King
Island council put a man there to deal
with the invaders so they would not swim
the three miles over to the larger, rabbit-
free, cattle-raising island. But the bunnies
didn’t take the long swim, and among
those rocks and rookeries Bill Scott
merely kept their numbers in check. Each
year the rabbits, through inbreeding, be-
came smaller, and the fur more blue.
Then as suddenly as they came they died
out. Last century the same thing
occurred on Erith and Dover Islands of
the Kent Group, 44 miles south-east of
Wilson’s Promontory.
“C.E.”: Winding bunny from a log
with wire is not so easy as “Anketell”
would have us believe (B. 15/10/’47),
especially if the hollow is big enough to
allow Brer to keep moving out of the
way of the probing length. And why the
three feet of spiral worked on to one end,
seeing that not more than about two
inches of wire comes in contact with the
rabbit? A straight piece of wire with
a burred or flattened end for gripping is
all that’s necessary—or, if it is snapped
off with a kink, it fills the bill admirably.
With bunny contacted, the wire is simply
rolled in the hands, twisting up fur and
the slack in the pelt, then held tight while
the rodent is withdrawn. Bunny usually
puts all he’s got into resisting, often
losing large patches of skin before he’s
beaten, which makes the practice about
as humane as most other methods used
against him.

“Wippegong”: Sunday morning in
Sydney. The lawn is pretty scraggy, but
the day looks good enough for the beach.
The youngest colt, with an eye to the
day’s possibilities, has taken Mum her
second cup of tea, and I hunt for grain
in the voluminous chaff of the Sunday
paper ; then from outside comes a fretful
“chip-chip-chip-chip” that jerks a bloke
right out of suburbia. Quietly we follow
the sound and locate him in a neighbor’s
brush-box; a solitary sacred kingfisher
on his way south after a winter warmer
than ours. He’s probably tired, but not
so weary that he can’t call freely, for it’s
mating-time and his head is full of
urgent plans. The boys remark that he’s
just like a little kookaburra, as of course
he is; and his call, if deeper and faster,
would be similar to that of old Jack,
who labors under the reputation of being
a humorist just because his normal call
resembles the rattlings of some empty
human heads. Then a bulbul spots him,
and, with the arrogance of the usual
parasitic intruder, asks what the blazes
he is doing in this backyard. A couple
of loud-mouthed mynas join in, a sparrow
shouts abuse, a starling crosses to the
opposition, and in a jiff Halcyon sanctus
becomes a displaced bird, his gorgeous
blue flashing in the sun as he shows a
clean tail to the clamorous fowl behind
him. Over a further cup of tea I decide
to mow the lawn. If a bloke went out
for the day and left it like this, he
might come home to find the place occu-
pied by a tribe that couldn’t even speak
English.
FROM DOUBLE CREEK.
We knew him when, a country lad,
In either hot or cool
He rode an old grey horse they had
At Double Creek to school.
He grew to manhood where the ridge
From tall Genoa Peak
Runs out in timber to a bridge
That crosses Double Creek.
His father in the Kaiser’s war
Had bravely done his bit;
When Hitler flung a challenge far
Young “Bisty” answered it.
And later at El Alamein —
His mates around him prone—
He fought, a shelbhole’s lips between,
The Jerries on his own;
And kept his gun at work until—
Smashed leg and more to pay—
He lay, and saw Genoa Hill
So far, so far away,
And visioned in a fevered dream,
Too spent to move or speak,
A cottage by a Gippsland stream—
His home on Double Creek.
In handing out this rhymer’s “ref.,”
Inadequate and weak,
To “Bisty” Bristow, A.1.F.,
The lad from Double Creek,
I’m free to mention that in town
He’s toiling all serene,
And vows he would not for a crown
Have missed El Alamein.
VICTORIA.

“Stop rocking it, Actlington—you'll have the children car-sick!”
“Bo”: The search-party had set out
to comb the countryside when Marsden
failed to return home by nightfall from
a solo session of post-splitting in thick
country almost a mile from his property.
After an unsuccessful two-hour search
they made their way slowly back over the
ground he would be expected 4o cover
on his return. It was not until they were
within a few hundred yards of Marsden’s
own boundary fence that a shout from
one of them brought them all apace.
Watson had come across Marsden,
crawling on his stomach and dragging a
fractured leg after him. It transpired that
a tree he had felled had “come back”
with an unexpected puff of wind and a
limb had got him. It was Curly Bryant
who, noting the direction the injured man
was taking and making a rapid calcula-
tion, said “Y’ musta come across the
main road not far from Noonan’s pub
—why didn’t y’ make fer there?” Mars-
den turned a strained face up at his
rescuers. “What the hell was the good?”
he asked. “He won’t open the bar to
anyone after hours since the new John
had him up last month!”

“J.R.R.”: My neighbor and I decided
to clean the creek which ran through our
adjacent Southland farms (M.L.). He
intended to clean the stretch that ran
through his place by hitching an old
harrow to his tractor and getting into the
creek, tractor and all. Then, with his
man standing on the harrow, he would
move along, taking the weeds out as he
went. Not being able to get hold of an
experienced ditcher, I had to make do
with a newchum. I went out to the
creek with him the first day and got him
started; then I left, and I did not see
him again until he came in at dinner-time.
I asked him how the job was going.
“Oh, the job’s all right,” he replied with
some heat. “But it’s those coves next
door who’re gettin’ my goat. They’re
knocking that creek of yours about.
They’ve got the tractor hooked up to
the end of it where I started this morning
and as fast as I clean a bit they’re pullin’
it through into their place!”

“Sou’-west”: The presence of vast
deposits of ancient shells, and the entire
absence of live oysters, not only in the
Swan but up and down W.A.’s south-east
coast, has puzzled many persons, scientific
and otherwise. Back in the ’nineties
Saville Kent, under engagement by the
Forrest Government, laid beds of seed-
oysters along Blackwell Reach and other
likely spots on the Swan, without success.
Earlier still Edmund Stirling, founder of
Perth’s “Daily News,” imported 1500
Sydney Rock oysters, which he placed
as seed in many likely spots around the
mouth of the Swan and on the adjacent
islands, but no trace of any propagation
was later found. For 40 years an oyster
depot at Bicton on the Swan has housed
multitudes of the molluscs, importations
from N.S.W., awaiting market demands.
Many of these oysters must have shed
spat, but, though there are plenty of piles
and other such timbers handy, no oysters
have appeared anywhere. About 12 years
ago luggers from Broome, in for repairs,
introduced a small thin-shelled oyster,
which even grew a small pearl, but such
have long since disappeared. The same
used to apply to the large mussel, at one
time non-existent around Fremantle.
However, a dredge from the East brought
some in her keel, and now these are to
be found not only on the Swan bridges
but as far around Cockburn Sound as
Rockingham.

“Adelaide”: Prickly-pear has started
to spread in S.A., which was supposed
to be too far south for it, and it grows
as an “ornament” about Adelaide. At
Peterborough, fairly far north, it has been
found dangerous enough for the use of
5000 cactoblastis eggs from Queensland.

“Mat’s Mate” : We were broke, dusty,
dry and desperate when we sighted the
Coronation through the Pilliga scrub-
fringe around Burren Junction and went
“Waggle your head, Jarvis —We must finish the peal.”
into conference. Ten minutes later I
dropped into the bar and saw Mat lean-
ing against a wall. “G’day,” I said,
heartily. “How are y’?” “None the
better for you askin’,” he sneered.
“What’s wrong with you?” I snapped
belligerently. He pushed himself off the
wall, kicked an empty beer-crate aside
and prepared for battle. “What about
me tin o’ sardines?” he roared. “Yair?”
I roared back, shoving two empty kegs
out of the road. “And what about them
rowin’ boats? Who” Here the
publican said something about fighting
in the bar, and Mat stabbed a finger at
him and yelled; “You know about them
sardines?” The astonished man was
staring at him when I shouted “By
cripes, y’ can’t eat rowin’ boats and I’ll
have” The publican hurriedly filled
two pots. “Here,” he said, “cool off,
cool off.” We cooled off. Mat suggested
he repeat the dose. He did, and so did
we. Then he said, “Now, what about
them sardines and boats?” Mat and I
looked' at each other in astonishment.
“Sardines?” he said. “Boats?” said I.
Then we turned alarmed faces on that
publican, backed to the door and, looking
at him and each other significantly —
bolted.

“A.L.A.” (Fiji): From their crater-like
homes in the ground which they occupy
for the greater part of the year the Fiji
crabs have now emerged for their annual
pilgrimage to the sea. Hiding by day and
travelling only by night, they keep a
a straight course whenever possible, and
in their obsession will scale walls and
enter the open doors of houses standing
in their path. During the last migration
I found a crab tentatively exploring the
bathroom-shower outlet, and, on our re-
turn from an outing recently, our domes-
tic puss, with arching back, stiffened tail
and a preparatory sparring paw, warned
us of the huge fellow which had taken
shelter under a bookcase. Throughout
this month ghostlike tapping sounds
coming from the back of boxes housing
sitting hens provide an ejection-order
problem in dealing with these crustaceap
monsters with their formidable, waving
claws. But the excitement dies with the
birth of the hurricane season, beginning
in November.
* * * *
“Zake”: I used to think the only things
on the line that would stop a train in
full flight were grasshoppers, caterpillars
or another train carelessly left there —
that was, until I saw umbrella grass in
action. Deciding to leave home, the
parachute-like stalks leave themselves to
the waywardness of the winds, which
occasionally, with devilish ingenuity,
muster them into a railway cutting. The
heaviest engine hauling its 600-ton load
up a slight incline is brought to a halt,
and it doesn’t take many of these vege-
tables, the greasy quality of which earns
many a railwayman’s curse.
% * * *
“Macnell”: Come and peer into my
naturalist’s hunting-ground in a deep
blue lagoon lying like a patch of fallen
sky. Where cliffs fall sheer into deep
water the tide moves vertically up and
down. Here the ebb flows horizontally,
like a liquid carpet being unrolled and
disclosing the floor of the sea, and here,
when the tide is out, are clumps of coral
which are hollowed and cracked so that
they form pools and little caves. In one
pool, shaking the sunlight all through it,
there would appear to be only a few bits
of seaweed and pebbles and coral sand.
But look closely and you see delicate fila-
ments, suspended in the still water like
drapes of motionless flame. These are the
gills of an invisible marine worm. There
are two anemones close together, or so
it seems. Look closer and you discover
that one is not an anemone but a vora-
cious sea-slug actually gnawing away at
the real anemone, eating it —and it’s the
same color, because it has got some of
its victim inside it. In one large pool
open to the lagoon slides an octopus.
At our shadow it spurts away, and you
see its body change from grey to deep-
red br«wn as quickly as a girl would
blush as it passes from sand to weed.
Lift up a flat stone; it is like lifting the
roof of a cave. First you see the little
fish darting from under. Some of these
rely on speed to get away, but one is
marked with slanting light and dark
bands, like a war-time ship, and these
marks blend perfectly with the weed and
rock. There are brittle stars which, think-.
ing the game is up, deliberately cast off
one of their legs. It jerks in the most
lively fashion to distract your attention.
The more you look the more you see,
so that a pool of sea-water no bigger
than a table-top holds enough to interest
the naturalist for hours on end.

“Gumsucker”; My entry for the origin
of “damper.” Before the arrival of the
modern stove roasts were cooked and
bread baked in a sheet-iron oven built
in to the brickwork alongside the then
large open fireplace. A separate fire was
lit in a small hearth under the oven, be-
ing connected by a flue with the chimney.
To regulate the heat of the oven a*sliding
plate of sheet-iron opened or closed this
oven flue, damping the fire down —thus
it was called a “damper”; a name still
used in connection with steam boilers.
Bread-baking in the oven —quite a job
for the housewife —was done at most
twice a week. But an emergency loaf of
unrisen bread could be cooked over the
open fire by using the oven-damper as an
emergency girdle. Such a loaf became
a “damper.” The term came to Aus-
tralia with the early settlers. The trans-
mission from the damper-plate over the
kitchen fire to a swept hearth of a camp-
fire was easy, shape and nature of the
loaf being the same. A “girdle,” by the
way, was a round, or square, of sheet-
metal, supported by a loop like a bucket-
handle. Suspended from the chimney-
chains over the open kitchen fire it
enabled the colonial housewife to bake
either scones or damper.

“Mug”: As Barney got only a pound
a day working for old Silas during the
week, he made it a practice not to spend
more than that amount at the pub on the
week-ends. With his crop ready for har-
vesting and no outside help available,
Silas approached Barney on the subject
of Saturday work. “Well, it’s agen me
principles t’ break these here forty-hour-
a-week rules,” Barney pointed out
thoughtfully, “but seem’ y’re stuck I
s’pose a bit o’ overtime won’t hurt me
till the crop’s in, I’d be makin’ double
pay, o’ course, f’r the Sat’dee work?”
Silas nodded and worriedly agreed he
would. So the following three Satur-
days Barney put in on the job. At the
end of the month the boss handed out
the wages cheque calculated on the basis
of a six-day week at one pound a day.
“Here, y’ ain’t paid me double time f’r
me Saturdays,” Barney protested hotly. •
“Gripes,” squawked Silas, “I never said
anything about that. It was you worked
out y’d be makin’ double pay. Well,
there’s the quid I paid y’ an’ the one y’
saved be not goin’ to’ the pub, ain’t
there? Ain’t that two quid a day?”

“Flathead”: Bung’s monologue at the
Royal:
You can tell a lot about a bloke by what
he lights his fags with. Take that old p’iiceman
who used wax matches all his life. Used to
come in here every night at six, start yarning
to his cronies, and at about quarter to seven
he’d suddenly discover that “Time” should
have been called long ago. And on Sundays,
if he happened to be passing and heard a noise
in the bar, he’d put it down to mice and walk
over to the other pavement. When he retired
a young cove, the cigarette-lighter type, took
his place —very keen, with red hair, moustache
and temper to match. First* night he was here
he came in and read the Act to my regulars.
Gave them a terrible shock. Later on, though,
1 teed it up so that anyone badly needing a
nip could get it by pumping one of those
miniature bowsers for fag-lighter juice which
we had in the hall then and which nobody
used. It went well for a while until one night
the young constable came in at five past six
to congratulate me on my empty bar. When
he spotted the little bowser he fished out his
lighter and headed over to fill it. Now, 1
knew my likker, and I tried to stop him, but
he’d already filled up and started flicking a
the lighter’s wheel. When the flames died down
we had a hard time convincing him that he
didn’t look naked without his moustache As
he was doing a shiver we took him inside and
gave him something purely for medicinal pur- .
poses and by the time he’d finished shaking
he was convinced that what the town needed
was a- place where a bloke could get a bracer
after hours if he happened to meet with an
accident. He was a changed man after that.
Last time I saw him down on a beat
he was striking waxes on his seat like a “good
’un.”
SMOOTH STONES.
How smooth and ripplingly they
run,
The wise, the .old
Saws and racy phrases
That gift the common tongue with
airs and graces,
By countless generations rubbed
and rolled,
Rhythms and words
By lips, palates, chords,
And the supple tongue
Shaped, and like emeralds strung:
“Fast bind, fast find,”
“Out of sight, out of mind,”
“Stew in his juice,”
“Sauce for the goose,”
“Never say die,”
“Once bitten twice shy,”
“Red in the morning
The shepherd’s warning”—
The rough rugged stone
From the rock-face thrown
Plunged and crashed
Into the noisy torrent;
Urged by the current,
By his fellows elbowed, jostled,
Hurried, bustled,
Hither and thither dashed,
Swiftly seaward borne,
Until, abraded, scoured, worn,
Its every jut uncouth,
Polished to silken smooth,
It nestles in your fist
Lovingly caressed,
Anew, transfigured thing
Fit for David’s sling.

Tar Brands.
THE MAN ON
THE LAND
"DON'T WORRY. I'M SENDING IT TO
GRAZCOS."
“Archaps”: The Australian Wool
Board has again expressed concern at the
damage caused by tar branding, and has
circulated copies of letters from woollen
manufacturers complaining of the loss
caused through tar and paint branding,
particularly in high-class carding wools
used for making fine, felted fabrics such
as cloth for billiard tables.
Amongst graziers, however, there is no
unanimity. Some contend that tar brand-
ing is unnecessary, others are equally
sure that it is necessary, particularly for
marking travelling sheep, which often
move along unfenced routes. If branding
is essential, then the only people who can
do anything are the scientists, who must
evolve a branding fluid capable of stand-
ing up to a year’s weather and still .be
readily soluble in a scour. There were
hopes some months ago that two scientists
had solved this problem, but little has
been heard from them recently.
Tasmania makes branding optional,
and it is said that stockowners there are
hopeful that before long it will be pro-
hibited. Where sheep run on compara-
tively small areas, well fenced, it should
be easy to do away with branding, but it
will be a long time before it will be
possible to prohibit it in Queensland.
Before the war sorters in woollen mills
were able to cut off the pieces of comb-
ing wools damaged by brands, but the
Wool Board has been informed that with
the shorter working week and fewer
operatives available it has become a
heavy, if not an impossible, task. Dur-
ing the war slight imperfections were
allowed to pass, but it will not be long
before traditional British quality stand-
ards will be demanded by buyers of our
wool.
Raising Queen Bees.
“Bumble”: The ideal is a well-
developed, vigorous, prolific queen, and
her progeny should be docile and long-
lived. The colony from which the em-
bryo is taken should be selected for its
honey-gathering ability —its strong force
of workers through the season from a
moderate amount of brood denoting
long life of the bees—tractability and
subdued inclination to swarming. Queen-
raising may be undertaken any time when
good supplies of nectar and pollen are
rolling in, and the colonies for nursing
the cells should be strong in young bees.
Dodge the swarming season if possible,
for the propensity may thus be lessened
in the succeeding generation, and be
sure that drones from the best colonies
are available for mating. .
Equipment for artificial queen-raising
needn’t be elaborate ; wax cups for start-
ing the cells are the main requirement.
These are made with a dipping-stick of
pine, shaped and sandpapered at one end
to fit snugly in queen-cups normally
built among the combs by the bees. To
begin, having a small tin of melted wax
at hand, dip the stick first in water and
then to the depth of a queen-cup in wax ;
two successive dippings each being a
shorter coating of wax than the last.
The cups slip freely from the stick and,
with a little practice, a good number may
be made in a few minutes. Next required
are thin strips of board about 9in. by
£in,, waxed and the cups fixed in wax in
batches of six to the board. The boards
are then fitted in combs haying brood,
pollen and honey, from which sections
Sin. by 2in. have been cut horizontally,
the cups hanging inverted. Return the
frames to the hives for 24 hours to have
the bees fashion the cells.
Next graft the cells with very young
larvae from the worker cells of a selected
hive?. Scoop the grub and the accom-
panying white jelly With the aid of a tiny
wooden spoon, which can be fashioned
from a shaving. Place a batch of the
grafted cells in a hive that has been
queenless for 24 hours or more ; next day
it will be started and ready to be put in
the super of a strong two-storey hive.
Use an excluder over the bottom box to
keep the queen below. When the cells
have been sealed and are ready to hatch
they are given singly to queenless stocks
till the young queens mate and begin
laying ; these nuclei stocks may then be
built up to strong colonies or united with
others from which inferior queens' are
removed.
Lameness in Horses.
“K.W.R.”: Most cases in the fore-
limbs are located from the knee down-
wards. Genuine shoulder lameness, which
can be much more serious than lameness
in the lower legs, is usually due to acci-
dents such as slipping with the forelegs
wide apart, causing overstretching of
nerves and muscles ; blows in the region
of the shoulder, such as when runaway
horses blunder into trees or posts; or
kicks from other horses, which may cause
paralysis of the nerves supplying the
shoulder muscles. Horses pulling heavy
loads sometimes develop sudden lameness
Where lameness is very marked
diagnosis is not difficult. A reliable test
for pain in the joint itself is to raise the
foot directly towards the front, thus
bringing the head of the humerus forcibly
against the articular surface of the
shoulder blade. If the parts are in-
flamed, pain will make the horse rise com-
pletely off the ground.
When inflammation occurs in the large
tendinous muscles which pass over the
front of the shoulder joint, swelling may
be detected by careful comparison with
the other leg. Soreness will be present,
while the limb, when resting, will be bent
at the knee, the toe touching the ground
slightly behind the other leg. In the
majority of foot troubles, commonly mis-
taken for shoulder lameness, the foot is
extended. In old cases of shoulder lame-
ness, the muscles, particularly those cover-
ing the blade, may waste until little more
than skin covers the bone.
Hot fomentations applied by fastening
’several folds of blanket around the joint
and soaking frequently with hot water
“Well start on her at the fourth story!"
will reduce inflammation and tenderness
of recent shoulder injury. When soreness
is reduced, rub the muscles gently with
weak embrocation. Lameness usually
lasts for from two weeks, or even longer,
but if it persists apply a good blister over
the point of the shoulder and repeat if
necessary after a month. Confine the
horse to a small area away from other
animals, so that only a little voluntary
exercise may be taken.
Prefab. Silo.
“Crow Chewer”: To help solve the
problem of grain-storage during the bag
shortage an Adelaide engineer, Samuel
Lucas, has produced a prefabricated
wheat silo capable of storing up to 4500
bushels. The silo can be erected in one
day by two men, and is made of 14-gauge
sheet metal bolted together, on the lines
of a giant Meccano set. Vermin-free, it
will also protect the wheat from the
weather. It is expected to have the silos
in full-scale production by November,
and should be an effective aid towards
dealing with the desperate position in
which South Australian farmers find
themselves for wheat-storage, (Reads
well, but where will the inventor get his
14-gauge steel sheets?)
Sheep on Wheat Land.
“Atlanta”: To get the best from his
flock, the wheatfarmer should conserve
fodder. Oats, barley and chaff can be
used; but silos are needed for grain.
Silage is probably the best insurance
against drought, is not damaged by rain,
fire or mice, and will practically take the
place of green feed for ewes rearing
lambs, thus saving early lambs from
checks in a late season. If oats were
grown and cut early for silage, the plants
would grow again, and with good late
rains would make
late green feed or be
harvested for grain.
By growing fod-
der-crops for sheep
the rotation is
widened, and higher
yields will be had
from succeeding
wheat crops. Oats
are the most valu-
able rotation and
fodder-crop and also
stop take-all.
Keeping a flock of
good cross ewes and
mating them for fat-
lamb production is
good for average-
sized farms. One dis-
advantage is that
keeping ewes on the
fallows long enough
to control weeds
such as barley grass
is detrimental to pro-
duction of best-
quality fat lambs; all the same, ewes
and lambs are the best proposition.
Greases on the Farm.
“Endeeay”: Except for the lightest
grades, grease will riot flow except under
pressure. As well as being a lubricant it
forms a seal around the bearing and
keeps out dust, which collects on the ex-
cess grease outside of the bearing an is
there trapped.
Grease is made by incorporating a
thickening agent in mineral oil. This is
usually sometimes very similar in
composition to domestic soap, which is
made from tallow and caustic soda.

vitamins A and DB in highly concentrated form
will ensure that stock receive these vitamins in
adequate amounts. 'Vetemul' mixes easily with
water and ANY TYPE OF FEED. Following is o
summary of the main uses of 'Vetemul.'
for HORSES, when green feed is scarce and when
stabled for long periods.
for SHOWSTOCK, when, thrpugh hand feeding, the
supply of green feed is reduced and when shedded
for long periods.
for CALVES AND CATTLE, calves fed on skim milk,
dairy herds on dry feed, calves and cattle shedded
or during continued dull weather,
—q for PIGS, when fed mainly on skim milk or butter milk,
or scraps during dull weather when sties permit little
sunlight.
for SHEEP, where treatment is needed for vitamin A
deficiency diseases. Overseas tests have indicated
the value of vitamin A in cases of urinary eoleu
also for stud or show sheep brought in for hand
feeding.
- for POULTRY, when green feed is scarce, during con-
tinued dull weather, in sheds which permit little sun-
light, or sunlight through glass which destroys sun s
vitamin value, for breeding hens and for chickens in
battery brooders.
Vetemul' is an emulsion, therefore does not have unde-
irable muscular effects on any animal, or taint or make
>ily, the flesh of bacon pigs. It inixes ™> r e easily than
in oil and con be used with ANY TYPE OF FEED.
If your local chemist, stock ond station agent, produce
merchant or storekeeper cannot supply Vetemul write to

Potash is used instead of soda for soft
soap ; lime can be used instead of soda
to give a lime soap; not soluble in water
and so useless for domestic purposes, but
it will thicken an oil and make a grease.
For lubricating greases lime, soda and
aluminium soaps are mostly used.
Lime-base greases are most popular,
as they are water-resistant and do not
melt at the temperature encountered in
most farm machinery. The so-called cup
or compound greases belong to this class
and are widely used in spring-loaded or
screw-type grease cups from which fresh
clean grease feeds into the bearing, forc-
ing the old grease out. Grease of a
“tackier” nature can be made by using
a heavy mineral oil in its manufacture,
and also by adding traces of rubber; the
so-called high-pressure greases belong to
this class, and are widely used as chassis
greases, usually applied by a grease-gun
through a nipple. When using a grease-
gun it is essential that it be filled with
clean, dust-free grease and that the nipple
should be cleaned before applying the
gun.
The familiar axle grease is another
type of lime-base grease, and there is
another type for ball and roller bearings
operating at a moderate t temperature.
Aluminium-base greases are used mainly
for chassis lubrication, as they are more
water-resistant than the lime-base greases
and tend to be “tackier.” Good results
come from this type of grease on the
rollers of track-type tractors. Soda-base
greases are more or less water-soluble and
may be washed out of a bearing if sub-
jected to very wet conditions. Small
amounts of water will be absorbed, but
large amounts tend to wash the grease
away. This type is largely used in ball
and roller bearings, which, of course,
should always be kept free of water. In
the wheel bearings and universal joints
of cars and trucks, soda-base greases do
an excellent job. They are tough and
tenacious, and often exhibit a fibrous or
spongy appearance. Lime- and alu-
minium-base greases are quite smooth.
The biggest advantage of the soda-base
greases is their ability to lubricate under
high temperatures. They do not melt
readily, and if lime- or aluminium-base
greases melt and run out of a bearing a
soda-base grease will often do the job.
Petroleum jellies are often used as
greases, and they lubricate quite well pro-
vided that the temperature is not above
that of a warm day. They melt readily
in the sun and should not be used in
exposed positions.
’ Cocfim Moth.
“Mr.”; For both pears and apples in
Victoria use a combined spray of lead-
arsenate and white-oil emulsion, strength
31b. of lead-arsenate powder or 61b. of
paste, igal. white oil and lOOgal. of water.
If a lime-sulphur spray has been used re-
cently omit the oil until three weeks have
elapsed since application of the lime-
sulphur, otherwise foliage and fruit will
be damaged. Thoroughly cover each
fruit with the spray even if it means
thinning out the bunches.
To assist in timing the sprayings check
for moth emergence with lures. Apple
juice, cider, waste wine or sweetened
water placed in small vessels here and
there throughout the orchard will give a
pretty accurate indication of maximum
moth activity. As a further control mea-
sure bandage the trunks of the trees with
strips of sacking not later than the last
week in November and examine every
ten days until the fruit is removed from
the trees. Remove any cpver in the shape
of loose bark, etc.
Hints for the Farm.
“Myrr”: Recent tests by Vic. Depart-
ment of Agriculture demonstrate the effi-
ciency of sodium fluoride for worms in
pigs. Advantages claimed are that it can
be readily administered in the food, is
particularly efficient against the large
roundworm (A scar is) and is not expen-
sive. An effective dosage is 1 p.c. (11b. to
1001 b.) mixed evenly through the feed.
“Big Billy”: Where blackberry plants or
furze are growing in paddocks not being
grazed arsenic pentoxide is an effective
poison, but where animals are being de-
pastured atlacide solution is recommended.
Three sprayings are necessary, first in No-
vember, second six weeks later and the
final one in the spring of the following
year. If the pentoxide solution is used
and the bushes burnt take care to keep
away from the fumes of the fire.
“Don Drone”; White - ants can be
beaten (B. 13 /8 / ’47). Stop them getting
into buildings by putting iron shields on
foundation blocks and puddling the soil
around the blocks with creosote or zinc
chloride solution (one part in nine by
weight). If they are in the structure,
isolate them from the soil by breaking
down the communication tunnels. The
ants will die if they cannot reach the
soil. A usually' effective method is to
bore a hole into the centre of the nest
and blow in Paris green dust or white
arsenic.
“Myrrhee”: Second growth of sor-
ghum after pasturing or cutting, when
the stand is short and dark green, is
dangerous. However, if more than 2ft.
high, either as first or second growth,
or if a pale- or yellow-green color, it’s
safe enough to feed, A short, dark-green
crop cut and stored will still be danger-
ous to stock as the cyanide content isn't
greatly diminished by cutting and curing.
To be on the safe side cut the crop when
it reaches or exceeds 3ft. in height, and
never put stock on to a short stand grown
under droughty conditions.
“Mr.”; That iron plate recommended
for placing over the eyes of bulls with a
penchant for gate-crashing and fence-
jumping is as inhumane as it is unneces-
sary (B. 17/9/’47). A leather baffle
strapped around the horns and extending
well down over the eyes will serve the
same purpose, with less chance of injur-
ing the animal. It is advisable, however,
to give the bull an occasional run around
the bull-paddock without the baffle, other-
wise he’ll fret and rapidly lose condition.
“Bill C.”: Costly breakages are
avoided if farm implements are trucked
to the scene of operations instead of be-
ing dragged through gullies and ruts by
a team. Loading or unloading imple-
ments is easy if the truck is backed up
to the steep bank of a cutting. Attempts
to load or unload a heavy implement
by means of a ramp of boards against
the back of the truck can lead to serious
accidents if there are only two men at
work.
“Golly”: The ordinary 44gal. drum
(B. 8/10/’47) is* used extensively outback
as a goods box. The end is cut out and
hinged, then laid on a large post at the
roadside. The farmer who has one need
have no worry about mail or goods in
wet weather. A drum will hold two sacks
of grain as a feed-bin. For a water-
tank procure a damaged 90-95 gal. steel
drum from any rum and metho. distillery.
They are sold because they will not hold
white spirit.

schoolmaster Keith Pritt, who gave the
first toast. Indeed, anyone looking in on
the scene, with old Tom at his jolliest
laying the beer on regardless and express-
ing his share of the hero-worship with
extra lacings of rum in Keith Pritt’s
pewter mug, and with Bianna worshipping
at the same shrine with offerings of cake
—anyone thus looking in must have con-
cluded both that it was a most convivial
scene and that no one more clearly
showed signs to that effect than the hero
of the night, Keith himself.
And to tell the truth, Keith was begin-
ning to be vaguely aware of it. Had it
been his beloved Daisy looking in, she
would have been appalled by the cheese-
green hue now resting on that handsome
and highly-associated countenance. The
profile might still have been right, but
the drawn cheeks, the glazed eyes and,
most urgently of all, the unseen region
from the brimming throat down were
anything but right.
Keith, in short, was a goner; and
presently he was gone. He rose, he tried
to speak, he rushed out into the night,
and the night rushed in to meet him.
After the pea-soup thickness of the atmos-
phere he’d left, the cool night air hit him
with the force of oblivion.
The party Hnside —such is the deplor-
able influence of dog’s-nose, as the vulgar
call beer laced with rum or gin—did not
note his passing nor miss his presence.
They were themselves well on the road,
though, being hardier farers than one who
had never before fallen from grace, they
still had a distance to go.
KEITH PRITT, may his tribe increase
—for, it is pleasing to say, he too
is married now, not to Daisy but to Flora,
which may be reckoned on a higher plane
of nomenclature, embracing, as it seems
to do, the entire horticultural world —
Keith Pritt awoke from a deep dream of
anything but peace, and saw above him
in the gloom, making it dark and like
a coal-flower in bloom, an Angel of
sorts. Bianna.
In this rather tragic version of the
poem, it was not Keith Pritt but the Angel
who spoke.
“My word, Kelt boy,” said Bianna, “I
bin good woman to you all night.”
That was all. Love is ever brief.
Keit boy raised his benumbed head
from Bianna’s lap and scrambled to his
feet in the feed-shed straw.
The shed door was open and it was
already clear daylight outside. The sense
of a dreadful disgrace crushed heavily
down on him. His one clear thought was
that they’d all be talking.
And then there was that, squatted in
the straw. Vaguely it came to him—not,
praises be, from personal experience, but
from hearsay recollection—that the thing
to be done in these circumstances was
money. He felt in his pocket and said
“Here . . .Oh, my God!” And with that
he bolted from the shed, from the pres-
ence of his ministering Angel, and, con-
science-stricken, from The Bend also.
For ever.
Bianna sat in the straw with the heavy
coin in her hand. She sighed, as if her
heart were heavier still; but that being
quite impossible she presently got up, to
go to the kitchen and make old Tom
his morning cup of tea, and to ask, when
she took it in to him, how much the coin
Mister Kelt Britt had given her might be
worth,
Water Diviner.
He holds a forked stick straight in his
clever fingers,
Tramps the brown paddocks; the children
running behind him
Snort with excitement each time by
chance he lingers —
They say if waters are there he will surely
find them, » ;
And patiently wait for the twigs
mysterious impulse
To twist it to life in his scarred, his dead-
skin hands.
A movement —see now, it jerked itself
right over.
Submerged, unguessed at, pulling beneath
these lands
. I
The water is here, a soak, a river, a
spring ?
Enough for a day or a week, or maybe
for ever ;
More adventure this noon than anything
Before ; and afterwards, who knows, next
year or never ?
Their elders can frown and mutter coin-
cidence
These children know that this was never
a fraud:
Only the children, in fact, can guess from
whence
Rises this pure, unquenchable, rippling
hoard
That is so much more than water, the
beautiful stream
Plunging hidden and flowing for ever
under
The crust of the heavy soil; a perpetual
dream
Ready and tireless to drown the dabbler
in wonder.
The wise with irrefutable signs and sums
Prove and disprove, the wise as ever being
quick.
While over this dusty paddock a simple
comes
To shew enchantment with a forking
stick.

Unassailable Evidence.
“Four Moscow factory workers sent a letter
to ‘Pravda’ complaining that the head of the
British Military Mission had photographed their
factory. When the guards took him to the
management he said he was lodking for a
place to ski. No camera 1 was found on him.”
“Pravda” has with great reluctance
been compelled to follow up this un-
fortunate international affair. “With
deep pride in the selfless patriotism and
alertness of its loyal workers,” it pub-
lishes the sworn testimony of the faithful
quartet: —
Piotr Pimpski, who last year was made
a Hero of the Soviet Union for having
denounced his mother to the N.K.V.D.
for “harboring anti-Stalin thoughts,” said
he had just finished making notes of a
conversation he overheard between two
of his workmates, Dumsky Booboff and
Gregor Gagavitch, for submission to the
factory’s political commissar, when he
noticed someone in skirts, a pyjama coat
with an astrakhan collar, gumboots and
carrying a tartan umbrella. He knew
it was a pyjama coat because he had seen
one in a shop window in Berlin when
he was there with the occupation army.
To the guards who had marched him
and his fellow-workers to the factory that
morning he had pointed out this sus-
picious figure, who had an easel set up
in the street and was apparently sketch-
ing the design of where the window
would be when the gigantic Red October
glass factory to be built under the
fifteenth Five Year Plan got into pro-
duction. The factory made kerosene-
lamp wicks, and he thought the English
Fascist spy was trying to get the secret
of this latest invention of the Soviet’s
wonderful team of brilliant scientists.
Dumsky Booboff said he was busy
secretly timing his workmate Gregor
Gagavitch to see if he was maintaining
the speed set by the factory’s Stakfiano-
vite hero —failure to do this carried the
death penalty when he happened to
look up. He saw a bent old man with
long whiskers, dressed in an ankle-length
fur coat and a white tropical helmet
and carrying a home-made bomb in each
hand, about to walk through the open
door. A palpable spy, because he
didn’t keep looking round to see if he
was being followed. Later footprints only
three inches longer than the spy’s were
plainly visible on the mud floor of the
factory. He, Booboff, had grappled with
the intruder and after a terrific fight had
overpowered him and dragged him off
to N.K.V.D, headquarters. Here the sus-
"There! You'll still be able to go to the
garden party."
pect produced papers showing he was a
British major-general, and admitted he
was acting under orders from Churchill.
Ilyich Crawloff said he was, as in-
structed by the factory’s political com-
missar, engaged in spying on Piotr
Pimpski to see if he was spying on his
fellow-workers properly, when he saw a
short, fat man standing on the saddle
of a grey horse peering through the open
door of the factory. At first he, Ilyich,
thought he was a Soviet worker by the
American lease-lend sandbags wrapped
around his feet as a substitute for boots.
But then he was wearing a shirt, so he
couldn’t possibly be a Soviet worker.
He was also clad in a dinner jacket, a
straw-boater hat, short pants and a yellow
scarf, and was operating a movie camera
on a tripod. When arrested by a passing
squad of soldiers who were marching
workers to another factory near by the
culprit confessed that he was head of the
British Military Mission and was trying
to get for the British Government the
secret of the shoe-horn, a recent inven-
tion by one of the U.S.S.R.’s most brilli-
ant scientists.
Gregor Gagavitch, the fourth worker,
said he was busy in his capacity as an
N.K.V.D. “workshop agent” in checking
up on the activities of Booboff, Crawloff
and Pimpski when he happened to look
up at the roof and saw a tall, thin man
with side-levers, dressed inconspicu-
ously in a pink-and-orange-striped foot-
ball guernsey, grey top hat, polo jodh-
purs and slaughterman’s boots, lift a
sheet of bark off the roof and furtively
lower through the aperture a long rubber
nozzle connected with a huge cylinder.
A squad of workers’ guards had arrested
the Thin Man and taken him before the
Factory Committee, which was sitting to
authorise an increase in weekly hours
from 58 to 64. The man, who said he
was a British General, almost eagerly
confessed that the cylinder contained
poison gas. The combined British and
American General Staffs, desperately
anxious to halt the vital production of
samovar handles and dog-collars, on
which the factory was ex-
clusively engaged, had
selected him for this
sabotage job.
In its graceful, re-
strained style “Pravda”
wound up Us discussion
of the affair with these
words:
“The attempt of this
Fascist offal to spy on
the mighty Soviet Union
at the behest of the filthy
beasts of British im-
perialists and their cor-
rupt, degenerate Ameri-,
can masters has been
brilliantly exposed by our
incorruptible workers. It
is still further proof of
the hysterical preparation
for war against the
Soviets which these slimy,
crawling maggots of the
Western bloc are mak-
ing. This , suppurating
vermin in his rotten old school tie is
one with the rest of the debased British
officer corps that worked secretly for
Hitler against the Red Army, which
single-handed defeated on land, sea
and in the air the German and Japanese
Fascists. The stinking scum of the Wes-
tern plutocracies are lower than rattle-
snakes. Let them keep their pigs’ snouts
out of our beautiful Soviet garden. We
have seen things floating on cesspools
of far greater honor and decency than
those scrofulous vipers Truman and
Attlee.”
Two days later “Pravda” announced
that Pimpski had died of a sudden heart
attack, and that Booboff and Gagavitch
had had sharp attacks of lead-poisoning
in the back of the neck and were not
expected to recover.

Optical Illusion.
“Any person can see a ghost, provided he
develops the latent power,” says the president
of the Psychic Research Society.
It seems the power within us lies
To witness any casual spectre
That may arise in mortal guise
Before a practised spook-detector;
With this in mind, you’ll recognise
When sights supernal or infernal
Inflict themselves upon your eyes,
The trouble’s probably internal.
And if you want the recipe
For what they call the latent power
That will enable you to see
At practically any hour
The sort of things I’ll guarantee
To bulge your eyes and parch your
throttle,
By those who know it’s held to be —

spectacle of some elderly yachts trying

THE OTHER FELLOW'S MIND
The contributor placed first is paid
4|d. per line; all others 2£d. per line.
Harvest Labor
After a month in N.S.W. wheat districts
I fear that an ugly labor situation may de-
velop. Most country towns are thronged
with “Cornel Wilde haircuts” and other
loafers, truculently demanding to know
where these “three-quid-a-daiy-tax-free
jobs are. Most of them are broke and
living on their wits. The cockies are
advising them to try out beyond Bourke
for wages like that, as they flatly refuse
to be held to ransom for such a figure.
Farmers seem to be united in their de-
termination to let their crops rot rather
than pay such exorbitant wages. The
average crop will take 10 weeks to har-
vest, and by the time he has paid his taxes
the farmer wont have as much in his
pocket as the long-haired boys.
There are plenty of decent men willing
to give a hand with the harvest. Why
dpesn’t the Commonwealth Employment
Bureau organise a proper scheme to
enable such men to find out where jobs
at reasonable wages ai;e available? The
department which shelters this show has
2478 employees—doing what? — Marti-
mus (N.S.W.).
Miners Wanted
The present coal shortage in Australia
—and in many other countries —is partly
due to the dearth of willing and ex-
perienced miners. Sons of miners are
becoming less and less inclined to follow
their fathers’ occupation, doubtless be-
cause they can get less irksome jobs else-
where, while many of those prepared to
go underground seem unable or unwilling
to give continuous and satisfactory ser-
vice. Plainly, whatever may be done to
improve the mines, coal production will
continue to fall short of the increasing
demand unless the industry is supplied
with adequately-trained men who are
prepared to take on coal-mining as a
worth-while career.
What is being done in Holland, which
is faced with much the some problems as
Australia, merits serious consideration by
Australian coal authorities. For many
years the Dutch State Coalmines have
operated a training scheme, the object of
which was to fit youths for work in the
mines. Since the war ended the scheme
has been entirely revised. The present
system aims at taking boys straight from
primary schools—though provision is also
made for training youths who have left
school for two or three years and have
not become settled in a satisfactory occu-
pation.
Classroom tuition is kept to a mini-
mum —in the early stages emphasis is
laid on outdoor activities based on Boy
Scout methods, which are regarded as
the most satisfactory way of training in
observation, self-reliance and general
citizenship. Much of the time is devoted
to useful workshop training and, later,
there is instruction in actual mines close
to the surface, underground work being
introduced gradually, starting with one
day a week.
The training schools, situated at the
collieries, are equipped with gymnasiums
and other facilities and are run with
the aid of advisory committees consisting
of representatives of parents, churches
and other organisations. Religious in-
struction, incidentally, is included in the
training programme, as well as sports,
handwork, hobbies, scoutcraft, etc. Train-
ing is largely directed by “troop leaders”
—specially selected young mineworkers
with ability for leadership and high moral
standards.
It is early yet to predict the effect of
the new training scheme, but the director
of the mining schools reports that it is
proving very popular with boys in the
mining districts, and that more applica-
tions for enrolment are being received
than can be handled. The introduction
of training schools on similar lines might
do a good deal for the Australian indus-
try,—Wusslean (Vic.).
Soldiers Barred
It seems that everybody in Australia
gets gift money free of taxation except ex-
servicemen. Quiz prizes, lottery prizes,
winnings from bookmakers—all these
are free of tax, which puts the taxing
authorities right with the sporting crowd,
who, after all, count most ip this country.
Poor fools of ex-servicemen who were
given a gift bonus by their employers on
return from service actually expected that
they would rank with quiz and lottery
winners and get their gift bonuses tax-
free. But the fact that the bonuses were
gifts didn’t count a scrap with the taxing
authorities. They ruled the gifts were in-
come.
1 wanted to fight these authorities
about my bonus, but they showed me
clearly that all the legal guns were against
me and I couldn’t get anybody to help
me. Anyway, by the time the taxation
department had finished with my bonus
there wasn’t enough left to engage a
lawyer’s office boy. Thousands of em-
ployers throughout Australia gave their
ex-service staff gift money one way and
another, but a big proportion of it went
to the Taxation Department.
The “Government” is probably not
ashamed of the fact that anybody in Aus-
tralia, except a serviceman, is taxed on
only 5 p.c. of gift money. —Camsa (S.A.).
Ninth Unit
Just before his 58th birthday a N. S.
Wales schoolteacher of 40 years’ experi-
ence was notified by the Department of
Education that he was now eligible to
take out his “ninth unit” of superannua-
tion, which would increase his pension
from £4 to £4 10s. a week. This, the
notice naively intimated, would mean a
reduction of exactly £5 12s. 7d. in the
teacher’s fortnightly cheque until his re-
tirement at 60.- Doing some hasty mental
arithmetic, the ped. decided to carry on
with his eight units. Later he found that
had he succumbed to the costly lure of
the ninth unit he would have actually
lowered his pension by Is. 6d. a week.
This is how the handbook of the
N.S.W. Public Schoolteachers’ Federa-
tion sets out the table of old-age pen-
sions and superannuation for a man and
wife:
No Amount
of ’ Super. Tax of 0.-A. Total
Units. Pension. Deduction. Pension. Income.
2 £lO 0 Nil £3 5 0 £4 5 0
24 1 5 0 Nil 3 5 0 410 0
3 110 0 Nil 3 5 0 415 0
4 2 0 0 Nil 3 5 0 5 5 0
5 210 0 Nil 2 15* 0 5 5 0
6 3 0 0 Nil 2 5 0 5 5 0
7 310 0 1/6 115 0 5 3 0
8 400 2/6 150 526
9 410 0 4/- 015 0 5 1 0
Examining the proposition still further,
the teacher found that it would take him
11 years at 10s. a week to get back the
money paid in two years. In the case of
early demise it would take his widow
22 years, widows being relegated to half
pensions. Then there is the possibility
that his widow might remarry within
a couple of years, in which case the pen-
sion ceases immediately and a benevolent
Government comes out very well on the
deal.— Bungle (N.S.W.).
Contrasts
When Mr. Calwell opened his Federal-
election campaign at the Melbourne
Town Hall he was supported by Mr.
Ward; and the Hon. Eddie stole the
show.
No notes for Eddie; no prepared
statistics detailing for thoughtful mem-
bers of the audience the respective per-
formances of the past and present Gov-
ernments ; no appeals to reason; no ex-
"Where s y’r adventurous spirit , ’ Erb—go an play on the slippery-dip.”
amination of parties and policies none
of these effete democratic conventions
for Eddie. He had one purpose —to attack
Mr. Menzies—and he carried it out with
gusto. He rattled out abuse, distortions,
vulgarities and gutter wisecracks for over
an hour, and the crowd screeched in
high humor, and at the end rose and
cheered. Eddie accepted the uproarious
adulation with gratification, and re-
marked that now they could see that
perhaps he was not so bad as The
Bulletin and the Liberals said he was.
Coyly he promised his swooning fans
that he would be back soon. It was
evidently one of these admirers who
later in the same campaign, when Mr.
Drakeford ungrudgingly admitted that
Mr. Menzies was a clever man and could
make a case for anything, shouted “Eddie
Ward could lose him!”
I hope this adherent listened to the
broadcast of his idol replying to the
Menzies speech on the banking bill. The
Opposition-leader attacked with deadly
skill. Each argument drove deeper the
preceding one, the cumulative effect being
overpowering ; the voice was calm and
unhurried, yet with a cold judicial bite. It
must have carried conviction to all
sensible listeners —even to many of the
Caucus-cowed occupants of the Gov-
ment benches.
Then came Mr. Ward. His speech had
exactly the effect of the buffoon who
appears to relieve the emotional tension
that follows great drama.
Listening to his strained shrill voice
and threadbare arguments one felt almost
sorry for him; he who had strutted so
proudly in Melbourne, whose ranting
demagogy had held the hosts of the
politically immature in fevered enchant-
ment. What a figure he had appeared
with no Menzies as a contrast! Now,
bad-temperedly trying to bluster away
irrefutable logic, he seemed truly revealed
—a professional windbag.
The two chosen spokesmen demon-
strated sharply not only their individual
contrasts but the contrasts between their
parties. Thousands of the great mass of
the undecided, which swings every elec-
tion, must now be turning from a party
that reaches its most inspired heights in
Wardism to a party that can produce a
leader who acts, thinks and speaks as
Mr. Menzies does. — Pasquin (Vic.).
Pub-baiting
“A.D.’s” assertion that “we have had
more than enough of this hotel-baiting ’
(B. 29/10/’47) may be warranted as far
as Saturday-afternoon drinking in subur-
ban pubs in S.A. is concerned, but let
him try his luck in Sydney’s metropolitan
area at 3 p.m. or 4 p.m. any Saturday.
He’ll soon realise how much “baiting”
remains to be done before a man can
enjoy a leisurely beer and a quiet yarn
with his mates.
To begin with, he’ll find most of the
metropolitan area’s 200 or 300 pubs shut
tight. In many that are open, a handful
of resigned citizens will be sipping spirits
or wine, the beer having “gone off” a
couple of hours before. None of these
desultory drinkers will be playing cards
or quoits. When the beer goes off in one
Elizabeth-street hostelry “A.D.” will even
be refused a drink of any kind, although
the bar remains open with one apathetic
barmaid reading a magazine. That hap-
pened to me, and as I was not sure of the
legal position at the time I went no
further than demanding to see the licen-
see, who arrogantly brushed me off with
“It’ll do you no good to call a police-
man. We can do as we please, and I tell
you we’re serving no more drinks today! ”
In the few remaining open pubs “A.D,”
will find, after he has pushed his way in,
a solid mass of men struggling three and
four deep around the bar, with others
crowding the corners and every available
space. He’ll probably have to hold his
elbow close to his side to raise his glass.
He’ll find' the floor wet with spilt liquor
and vomit; broken glass crackling under-
foot ; the air stale with smoke and beery
breath ; the bar attendants working fever-
ishly to cope with the scramble; and over
all a loud, jarring cacophony of shouting,
laughter and drunken song.
A considerable number of the guzzlers
will be half under. This is because they
haven’t confined their drinking to
“A.D.’s” “occasional pot” ; in their pig-
gish greed they’ve bought twd or three
schooners at a time and, fearful lest the
beer should go off at any minute (as it
does), gulped them down with unneces-
sary haste, then repeated the process.
I’m not exaggerating. I’ve personally
encountered these maddening Saturday-
aftemoon conditions in Sydney through-
out October. And many of the suburban
houses -are no better. In any case, why
should I be hampered by geographical
limitations? Why can’t I get a drink
easily, anywhere?
As for literature being the poorer with-
out pubs, I’m not looking for fiction
characters when I front the bar —I’m
looking for beer. And if the fact that I
often miss out doesn’t call for continued
baiting I’ll—l’ll give the blasted stuff
away! — Cal (N.S.W.).
Drift from Westralia
Press and radio have, in -recent weeks,
told the public that the aciite shortage
of veterinary officers in Westralia is not
likely to be overcome for the next three
years. They say that the only veterinary
school we- have is at Sydney University,
where about 300 students are doing five-
year courses. There are ample openings
for these in the Eastern States and N.Z.
Four veterinary officers recently came
to W.A. from England, but already two
of them have found better positions, one
in Singapore. The West is mainly a farm-
ing State, and, to my knowledge, requests
to the Agricultural Department for the
services of vets, in various stock areas
have been turned down because of lack
of suitable men.
Westralia has also lost valuable and
highly-trained men in other departments
in recent years because of more lucrative
salaries being paid by other States. T)ie
solution would seem to be raising salaries
in their home State. —Ah Gee (W.A.).
Root of the Matter
Service for country people is, I assume,
the idea behind country editions of news-
papers, yet almost invariably there is a
“Sorry—No Mail Orders” at the foot of
advertisements for clothing, china, glass-
ware and most other things that are
scarce. As we country dwellers rely
entirely on catalogues and newspapers for
contact with city shops, it be
imagined how exasperating these “no-
mail-order” notices are. — Mac (N.S.W.).
Some city firms advise their country
customers to “add so much for freight.
It is a good idea and usually this works
efficiently enough, but on three occasions
I’ve been caught both ways. Although
they have collected money for “freight,
the firms concerned have sent the goods
“to pay,” thus doubling the cost for me
and increasing their own profits.
H. M. T. (N.S.W.).
Government control of shipping is sup-
posed to have been relaxed with the hand-
ing back of ships to their owners, but
there is still enough of it to enable the
Government to have a material say in
the running of the ships, particularly
coastal shipping. The stipulation that
new ships for that trade be built only
in Australia, where costs are considerably
higher than elsewhere, will prove a
further handicap. High cost of labor,
continuation of war bonuses, attendance
money for wharf-laborers, slower “turn-
round” of ships and a multitude of other
disadvantages are legacies of Government
control, where cost is regarded as of little
consequence, but they will add to the
difficulties which must be faced by the
industry and militate against its efficient
and economical running. Nautic
(N.S.W.).
I agree with “F.C.S.” (B. 22/10/’47)
that a share issue for employees m
private companies is a great idea, but can
it be done? A Westralian company an-
nounced that it would encourage share-
ownership among its employees, and that
the shares allotted could be paid for by
a small weekly deduction from the pay
envelope. The rush to accept the offer
was arrested by the news that the union
frowned on this attempt to “exploit the
workers,” and the scheme was abandoned.
—Kendon (W.A.).
I have been amused by the N. S. Wales
Government’s efforts to force grocers and
greengrocers to deliver. In almost every
suburb for the last two years there has
been at least one of each who was pre-
pared to deliver, and the Government’s
action will only rob those who have
voluntarily given this service of the bene-
fits of their initiative. If the Govern-
ment really wants to earn some kudos it
should make butchers deliver. No butcher
has made any attempt to relieve the
overburdened housewife of carrying her
heavy parcels of meat home.— Simple
Simon (N.S.W.).


Slave Labor
As an ex-p.-0.-w, and member of the
Eighth Division I can sympathise wit!
the Japanese agitation for the return to
their homeland of the 500,000 Japanese
—or so many of them as may still be
alive—who were taken prisoner by the
Russians more than two years ago. O
these no doubt some surrendered before
the end of the war, but they would be
only a small minority ; the remainder be
came prisoners at the general surrender
It now appears that Russia w r as
responsible for prolonging the war by
suppressing Japanese peace offers. Russia
entered the fighting when the issue was
beyond all doubt, and she was able to
reap immense rewards for doing practi-
cally nothing. I’m not forgetting die ill-
treatment by the Japanese of Allied
prisoners, but that is no justification for
a belligerent of several days’ standing to
hold in slavery half a million men for
more than two years.
A friend of mine who was in Korea
as a p.-0.-w. when the war ended tolc
me sufficient of the Russian troops and
their conduct to make me fear for the
lives and health of prisoners in their
hands. It is a remarkable thing that,
when there is so much talk of human
rights and so long after slavery has been
formally abolished by civilised Powers,
there is no clamor against this enormity.
There is talk about oppressed people in
Spain and elsewhere who are walking
about and working where they please.
Crocodile tears are shed for the sup-
posedly threatened freedom of Indo-
nesian ex - collaborators who wear
Japanese uniforms and carry Japanese
rifles. But one never hears a word of
the Soviet’s vast system of slave labor. —
Miles Gregarius (Q.).
Lord North
In referring to the Attlee regime
as “the most disastrous legislative body
and Government Great Britain has had
since the days of Lord North” (B.
15/10/’47), The Bulletin has done the
latter an injustice. North had his faults
—irresolution and a tendency to take the
line of least resistance can be fairly
charged against him—but his record was
decidedly more impressive than that of
the wretched crowd who in two short
years have reduced proud Britain to such,
a parlous condition.
North was a capable financier. His
Quebec Act, which settled the political
character of newly-conquered Canada*
assuring religious freedom and French
civil law to the province, was a magnani-
mous and far-sighted piece of legislation.
It is looked on by French-Canadians as
their Magna Carta. And historians of
hostile political faith have maligned North
in charging him with having caused the
alienation of the American colonies.
Actually his position was analogous to
that of Neville Chamberlain when he be-
came Prime Minister. Both had to cope
with situations bristling with difficulties
for which others were responsible.
The taxation measures which aroused
such a storm in the colonies were initi-
ated by former Administrations. North re-
moved all save a small duty on tea, main-
tained rightly as token of the para-
mountcy of the British Parliament over
the colonial legislatures. There were,
however, other causes of the War of
Independence for which no British states-
man can be held guilty.
The British effort in that war has been
unduly belittled by the majority of his-
torians. True, mistakes in conduct were
made, but they were no more numerous
or glaring than can be charged against
British arms in other major wars. Britain
lacked an ally, and was opposed not only
by rebels in 13 colonies of great extent
and mainly wild country, but for part
of the war by the other three main mari-
time Powers of Europe—France, Spain
and Holland. France’s navy, too, was
then particularly efficient. Yet Britain
was not outclassed. On the contrary,
at the end she was in a better position
to continue the war than were her op-
ponents. North, however, had fallen
from office and his successors, who had
played up to the rebels, were all for
peace.
If Britain’s original American colonies
were lost in that war, Canada was re-
tained, while Warren Hastings firmly laid
the foundations of British India.-— Clio
(N.S.W.).
Ambulance Men
I’m glad to see ambulance men de-
manding permission to administer mor-
phia in emergencies. In a country hos-
pital recently I was awakened one night
by the screams of a road-accident case.
His elbow was shattered, and he had had
to be brought seven miles by ambulance
before he could be given an injection.
He died, I was told afterwards, not
through injury but through shock. With
responsibility for cases like that on their
shoulders, surely ambulance men should
3 be allowed the means of easing pain,
i Their competence cannot be ques-
j tioned. Before they are qualified as am-
s bulance-drivers they must serve a period
3 as honorary bearers, then spend three
s years doing full-time medical training
[ under the eye of the ambulance superin-
“Wot Won the Cup? I've bin here since last Chewsd'y !”
tendent. Their training includes the use
of hypodermics. Throughout their
careers, both while training and when
qualified, they are examined yearly by a
doctor.
In countries such as America ambu-
lances have in attendance driver, doctor
and nurse, but here the ambulance-driver
must take full charge of the case, which
means that he must act, if required, as
driver, doctor and nurse. Such responsi-
bility alone merits the privilege of using
morphia when necessary. With its aid
the ambulance man could save busy doc-
tors unnecessary work and suffering
casualties unnecessary pain. Mac
(N.S.W.).
The Banks
For the last year or so the Common-
wealth Bank has been steadily buying sites
for future buildings all over Australia.
Is it likely if the Prime Minister, as
Treasurer, had it in mind to take over
all the existing banks that he would have
countenanced the buying of sites at their
present inflated values? No ; whatever
he says to the contrary, Chifley had no
thought of nationalising the banks when
he passed the 1945 legislation or when
he went to the country at the last Federal
election. His One Big Bank idea was
born out of pique when the High Court
scrubbed his attempt to force local-
government bodies to bank with the
“Commonwealth,” — Nugget (Vic.).
Dedman’s inference that 5000 fewer
bank officers would be required is amus-
ing to a trading-bank employee'. In the
main the private-bank officer is very
loyal to his institution and is always ready
and willing to do a little extra work by
speeding up, arriving at the office a
quarter of an hour early, taking work
home, putting in a few hours over the
week-end and so forth. Under Govern-
ment routine all that would disappear
and a steady pace would be set. Govern-
ment procedure would slow things up,
and existing departments within the bank
would quickly enlarge and sprout new
sections.—C. B. M. (N.S.W.).
A feature of the Government’s ad-
dresses on the subject is the revelation
of the terrible suffering we’ve been ex-
periencing all these years under the
thumb of private enterprise in banking
and industry. How Mr. Menzies and his
cohorts can possibly stand up and utter
a word in defence of the Ogres is almost
beyond me.
When I think of all the oppression I
suffered —being able to go whither I
would, buy a house when I could, farm
what I wanted, sell it when and where I
liked, buy an old car or a new car, raise a
loan or lend my money on mortgage, own
a week-ender at the beach or in the moun-
tains and so forth—l could simply cry
with relief now that I haven’t any money
to buy the property the Treasurer won’t
permit the owner to "sell or the car I
can’t get a priority for, and because I
can’t get the necessary machinery to
grow the crops the Government insists I
pass into the keeping of boards to mar-
ket for me to a “most-favored nation” at
below what it cost to produce.
Whacko for Chifley’s Golden Age!
What will it be like when statute replaces
regulations! — Jindivick (N.S.W.).
Recently, when Australian public-
opinion polls found that 63 p.c. of elec-
tors were opposed to the nationalisation
of private banks a constituent in Boothby
(S.A.) wrote to his Federal member, Mr.
Sheehy, and asked why the Chifley Gov-
ernment persisted in opposing majority
rule. This “Labor” politician, who is a
political accident, replied discrediting the
polls, saying that he placed no reliance
on their findings, and adding that he had
yet to meet the person who had been
interviewed.
Yet over the last six years these polls
have built up a remarkable record for
accuracy. They predicted exactly the re-
sult of the N. S. Wales referendum on
hotel hours; another poll foretold the
result of the last Federal election within
one per cent.; another, that the Powers
referendum would fail.
This method of sampling public opinion
has been scientifically worked out, and
is in use in many countries of the world.
But neither Mr.' Sheehy nor Mr. Chifley
would be game to test its accuracy in a
referendum on banking.—A. D. (S.A.).
Recent reports have stated that, should
Chifley’s bank grab come off, the Com-
monwealth Bank, would acquire, apart
from the Australian businesses of the
various banks, the assets of the Austra-
lian and British banks trading in New
Zealand. The Commonwealth Bank
would then have a very large business in
New Zealand.
Since the Commonwealth Government
would acquire, compulsorily or otherwise,
the business of the Bank of New Zealand
in Australia, has it not occurred to Mr,
Chifley that the New Zealand Govern-
ment could retaliate by taking over the
newly-acquired “large business” of the
Commonwealth Bank in that Dominion.
That would be dictatorship in reverse.
The British Government may also de-
cide to protect British nationals who are
trading in Australia and may take over,
compulsorily or otherwise, the business
and assets of the Commonwealth Bank
in England in return for the loss of
British assets in Australia. How would
that suit Labor’s platform?
Incidentally, in the case of one bank
incorporated by Royal Charter from the
British Crown it may prove to be a deli-
cate matter for the. Commonwealth Gov-
ernment casually to cancel that privilege,
Mr. Chifley may try to rule our small
nation with an iron hand but we would
be reduced to very small proportions if
counter-measures prohibited us from
having direct outside representation. We
should be truly isolated, and the terms
for conducting Australia’s overseas busi-
ness would not then be in the hands of
Labor,
Even France and China may have
something to say regarding the acquisi-
tion of file assets of their nationals in
Australia. —W. F. R. (Tas.).
“Spare the Rod ”
Sydney papers recently brought to
mind a case of juvenile depravity on a
mass scale which resulted in half a dozen
youths being convicted and sent to
various institutions.
Remember the sordid happenings
during war years when papers were full
of all kinds of scandal and sex talk about
visiting servicemen and local girls?
Growing boys had access to all this read-
ing, a? they have access today to “pin-up
pctures” and strips which are more
lascivious than comic. Do adults have
to be told of the exciting effect these
things have on the adolescent?
There is no doubt that our women
must be protected at all costs and that
they should be free to travel about at
night without fear. But young lads
should be protected, too, if only from
themselves. Parents should receive
psychological advice about their
youngsters and should be taught exactly
how to punish and when.
Many parents are too soft-hearted to
use the strap, saying “they are getting
too big for that sort of thing.” That’s
just the time when they need corporal
punishment most. If you don’t discipline
boys they will run wild. They respect
anybody who punishes them at the right
time, but laugh up their sleeves at weak
parents. There is far too much molly-
coddling of children today and not half
enough of the good old leather belt. —
Parent (N.S.W.).
Production and Taxation
Not only dairy produce, eggs and bacon
are being limited because of the high
taxation (B. 8/10/’47). The same thing
is happening in the meat indutry. Pro-
perties that could produce prime beef-
cattle are falling far short of their normal
capacity because the owner sees no sense
in working hard only to have a large
percentage of his earnings reefed off
him. So the cattle roam unmustered and
unsold.
On one run, because of bad conditions,
the cattle are dog-poor, with calves fast
dying off. Feeding is practically impos-
sible. Asked why he didn’t sell, the owner
replied: “What for? I wouldn’t get the
money. And surely some of ’em’U live
to breed up again.”
Good help being a thing of the past,
an owner must work hard every day of
the week and often far into the night,
to keep his farm at full production. With
the cities demanding more money for
less work, the producer is wondering why
he should go on always being the mug.—
C. E. (Vic.).
.
Theory and Practice
The one imponderable factor never
considered by those wordy socialists is
the human element, and it is the most
important of all. Every conceivable form
of government has been tried in one
country or another in the course of
history, and in the final analysis their
legislative programmes were only as
effective as the character, honesty and in-
dustry of the people who implemented
them. No social panacea yet devised has
found a substitute for those qualities.
This country is still a frontier State,
with all that that implies, and its develop-
ment calls for wise and far-sighted states-
manship which recognises that the wel-
fare and future of the nation, and not
simply of a component class, are its special
responsibility. There is a parallel between
present-day Australia and the U.S.A. of
the latter half of the nineteenth century.
The men who forged that nation’s pro-
gress during that time were the individual
surveyors, mining and construction engi-
neers, cattlemen, farmers and railroad
pioneers—all practical types, not notice-
ably loquacious.
Our Federal and State authorities
should take a lesson from American his-
tory and concern themselves only with
such public utilities as power and high-
ways. The real Australian is capable of
handling the practical tasks confronting
this country, and, left to his own re-
sources and freed of official red tape and
blueprints, he will do more and do it
quicker than any Government body.
We can’t afford to waste time and
energy on theoretical experiments, par-
ticularly as modern history affords no
instance of any country deriving any
appreciable benefit from a bureaucratic
regime, be it Socialist, Communist or
Fascist. Adherents of the first two ideolo-
gies invariably instance Russia to support
their arguments, completely ignoring the
fact that the pre-revolutionary regime was
a despotic and decadent oligarchy that
had nothing in common with our elected
Parliament. Further, the benefits of the
present Russian system are hard to find,
and the system itself has not yet with-
stood the test of time, as has our own.
To hope that the Russian form of
“government” will supplant our well-tried
Parliamentary institutions without first ex-
periencing the former as citizen- of the
U.S.S.R. is an extremely naive idea. The
very people who now profess such \fijhe-
ment faith in socialism would be the first
and the loudest to complain when their
hitherto unrestricted lives became
cramped and confined under the regula-
tions of Government prescriptions.—
Sceptic (Vic.).
