A MAN OF BOOKS.
Pather Leo Hayes, parish priest ai
Crow’s Nest, about 30 miles from Too
woomba (Q.), called on The Bulletin
recently and confessed that “counting
books, manuscripts, diaries, prison rolls
—•I have roll-books from the old convic
ships, you know —and thgre are maps anc
plans and charts—some very old charts- -
Government documents, pamphlets, news
papers—my Bulletins go back to the
very first copy—sketches, drawings anc
prints, books of newspaper cuttings” he
owns round about 60,000 items of Aus-
tralian.
Mitchell’s collection, given to the N. S
Wales Public Library, totalled 61,000
items when (after Government apathy
had nearly lost it the priceless bequest)
the Mitchell Library was opened in 1910,
so Father Hayes is running the older col-
lector pretty close.
When the Mitchell was opened Fathei
Hayes was a young priest working in the
library of Manly College. Not a wealthy
man like Mitchell, he was already fired
with the same enthusiasm and had begun
in a modest way to get together a collec-
tion of Australian books. Father Hayes
doesn’t recall ever having met Mitchell,
but, haunting the same bookshops, they
probably rubbed shoulders.
There is nothing of the recluse about
Father Hayes. A short, thickset man
with merry eyes twinkling from beneath
bushy white eyebrows, he enjoys company
and conversation. Most of The Bul-
letin’s literary staff trooped in to meet
him while Heth was sketching him. His
library, of course, is his passion, but it
is not his only hobby. There’s geology.
As he bobs up and down to shake hands
or to unwrap some of his treasures. Father
Hayes opens a jewel-case and brings out
a large gold medal.
“Have a look at this. Solid gold, you
know. Feel it. Worth over £2O, they tell
me. The Royal Geographic Society pre-
sented it to me. Made by the King’s
Engraver. That’s a wreath of Australian
wildflowerS engraved on it. They gave it
to me for work in the Carnarvon Ranges.
I was geologist and ethnologist to the
first scientific expedition ever to go
there.”
The Religious Editor fires a question.
The white eyebrows swish round, bring-
ing the head with them and causing Heth
to dodge round the room again to capture
the features that won’t stay still.
“How did I become a geologist? Well,
when I went to Ipswich as a young priest
I told the bishop I’d like to study geology.
‘What for?’ he asked me, ‘What good will
it do you?’ I told him I didn’t know, but
I wanted to study it. He said ‘Go ahead,’
so I went ahead and qualified at Brisbane
University. It’s a fascinating study. I
have a nice little collection of specimens
back home. But the books, of course,
are my real collection.”
“Where do you house it all?”
“All over the presbytery. Books every-
where. Shelves everywhere. And cup-
boards. They’re overflowing. I’ve even
books under my bed. And more coming
in all the time. Take poetry now. I have
between 2000 and 3000 volumes of Aus-
tralian and New Zealand poetry, many
of the books autographed by the writers
and annotated by themselves or by critics.
They form invaluable research material.”
He turns to Red Page.
“This should interest you. I have
Bertram Stevens’s book of cuttings relat-
ing to Australian literature—the work of
a lifetime—Stevens criticised and anno-
tated each item. He Intended to use the
book as a basis for a work on Australian
literature, but died too soon. And I
have A. G. Stephens’s collection of
literary manuscripts. You recall his
purple ink?”
He looks around. Yes, someone re-
members the purple ink.
“Well, he used it freely on this col-
lection. There are manuscripts from the
pens of Lawson, Paterson, Daley, Rod
Quinn, Edward Dyson, Shaw Neilson,
Arthur Adams, Favenc, Steele Rudd —
oh, the whole lot of them. They’re all
there. No one missing. And A.G.S. has
annotated them all in his purple ink. In-
valuable.”
“How did you come by them?”
“Stephens was a Toowoomba man,
you know. There are some of the family
still there. I’ve an interesting Kendall
manuscript, too. Written out very care-
fully, each letter formed separately. I’m
told he had an accident to his right hand
and always wrote with his left. There’s
a story behind that manuscript. It’s a
poem that was suppressed from Songs of
the Mountains.”
“‘Ninian Melville’?” puts in the Ser-
vice Department man.
“Yes, that’s it. ‘The Song of Ninian
Melville.’ It was omitted from the
second edition, you know. Suggestion of
slander. ‘Christmas Qreek’ replaced it.
And the piece I have is Kendall’s
original manuscript, in his own hand-
writing.”
He struggles with the string of a pack-
age he has been holding, then thrusts it
towards the Showman.
“Here, you try it.”
The Showman unties the parcel anc
hands two volumes to Father Hayes
who handles them lovingly.
“Look at this work. A Queensland
woman did it. A Manchester womar.
really, but she’s been in Queenslanc
quite a while now. I got her to do the
work for me. It’s in the manner of the
illuminated manuscripts of the Middle
Ages. See, black-letter work with pic-
tured initial letters. One book contains
my favorite Australian poems, the other
English verse. Look at those tiny water-
colors. Less than an inch square, yet
look at the detail. See, here’s Mary
Hannay Foott’s ‘Where the Pelican
Builds.’ Look at that little miniature.
Isn’t it a gem?”
He passes the book around and turns
to the other.
“And here’s Noyes’s ‘Highwayman.’
Look at those pictures. See, there’s the
inn and the Highwayman riding up on
his horse. See the soldiers? And the
landlord’s lovely daughter with the
musket beside her breast? Exquisite
work.”
And it is, too. The books are works
of art. The covers are of tooled leather
with semi-precious stones —opals and
agates among them—inset.
“Those stones I picked up myself
around Crow’s Nest.”
The Showman slips out and returns
with a large piece of stone he has been
using as a paperweight. He hands it to
Father Hayes, who fingers it and says;
“Northern Territory ribbon stone.
Tennant’s Creek I should say.”
The Showman admits that Tennant’s
Creek is where he found the slab,
“Yes, very pretty. Hard to work,
though. There are a couple of men in
Brisbane who could cut it for you.
Central Europeans. The American
soldiers did a lot to make us gem-con-
scious, you know. Opals especially they
were keen on.”
The Religious Editor introduces a
sombre note.
“Er, what do you propose to do with
your collection ultimately. Father? I
mean, er, well, what’s going to become
of it?”
“You mean when I die? It will re-
main in Queensland, where it was
gathered together.”
“Are you a Queenslander?”
“No, I was born at Frederickton, on
the Macleay River in northern New
'South Wales. But I’ve spent most of my
life in Queensland. I’ve been a priest
in many little Queensland towns, and
most of my collection has been gathered
together in Queensland. It will remain
in Queensland.”
He begins to wrap up his books.
“I left Manly College 37 years ago,
and I looked around their library for the
last time—l had worked in it for three
years, you know —and I said to them:
‘One of these days I’m going to have
more books than you’ve got here.’ They
had 15,000.”
“Ever been back since?”
“I’m going back tonight.”
Heth closes his sketch-book. Father
Hayes shakes hands all round and de-
parts, He is last seen making for
Tyrrell’s bookshop.

South with Mawson.
Telling the story of the 1911-14 Aus-
tralasian Antarctic Expedition on which
the author was assistant biologist,
Charles F. Laseron’s South with Maw-
son (Australian Publishing Co.) has one
chapter—the last —which could take its
place with ajiy of the great stories of
the South. That is the account of Maw-
son’s solitary march across 100 miles of
King George V Land to the base at
Commonwealth Bay after Ninnis had
crashed to his death down a crevasse and
Mertz had died of hunger, exposure and
exhaustion on the glacier that now bears
his name. The story has been told be-
fore, but is movingly retold here:
Now Mawson was alone—alone in a land
where loneliness weighs like a giant pall.
V • -Ten long days came and went, and
then, on the 17th of January, he had the
most trying experience of all. Suddenly
plunging through space in a hidden crevasse,
in a fraction of time the thought flashed
through his mind , that this was the end.
But, with a jerk that drove the breath from
his body, he pulled up, swinging round and
round at the end of his sledging rope. A
few feet above him was the half sledge,
wedged at the top of the crevasse, on either
hand two sheer walls which went down to
the depths below, and affording neither hand
nor foot hold by which to climb up.
Weakened by his previous trials, it seemed
hopeless to reach the surface, but at least
he would make the effort. Hand over hand
he hoisted himself up; then, when at last
he had his hand over the edge, it again
collapsed, again precipitating him to the
length of the rope. Then came the greatest
temptation of all. His knife was in his belt
—one cut, and his suffering would be over.
He wrestled with the idea, but, putting it
behind him, he again essayed the climb.
Inch by inch he went up, until it seemed
he could never reach the top. With the
last ounce of _ his strength he seized the
sledge, then painfully, feet foremost, pushed
himself out on top. For a while he lay
exhausted; then, resting every few minutes,
set about the task of erecting the tent,
finally to crawl into his sleeping-bag for
another day.
The rest of the book, inevitably, is on
a less exalted plane. There is never any
shortage of adventures—a man lost in a
blizzard for two hours, during which
time he was, apparently, never more
than 100 yards from the hut; a party
nearly cut off on the frozen and splinter-
ing sea in a sudden hurricane ; a sledg-
ing journey in which the author took
part when the whole party came very
close to death from carbon-monoxide
poisoning in a cave in the ice—but
Laseron is more concerned with the day-
to-day life of the expedition than with
heroics.
There is a danger in this kind of writ-
ing. A record of the humdrum, even in
a hut in King George V Land in the
Antarctic winter, is apt to remain hum-
drum. Little jokes which,, in the circum-
stances, were as uproarious as Rabelais
do not read so uproariously in print.
Lamentable comic verses do not become
less lamentable for being published in a
book. The writer’s problem, as always,
is not only what to put in but what to
leave out.
South with Mawson would have been
all the better for some selection and
compression of material. Another flaw
is the absence of a character-sketch of
Mawson. He is a strangely remote figure
in the book, as if Laseron had decided
to keep him in reserve for the last chap-
ter and had then given only the heroic
aspect of his personality.
Taken as a whole, however, the book
admirably succeeds in its purpose of pic-
turing the life of the expedition. Its
special merit is a merciful attention to
detail. Where seasoned explorers eat
hoosh and circumnavigate nunataks
without ever bothering to explain ex-
actly what these things are, Laseron, who
was a novice in the South, benevolently
(and, of course, correctly) assumes that
his readers will also be novices and pro-
vides the explanation. When the same
eye for detail is applied to; the rank and
file of the expedition, to the birds, the
seals, the icebergs, the winds and the
auroras the result is a remarkably clear
picture of the whole scene.
The detail observed with the greatest
relish, perhaps, is a skipper named Roar-
ing Tom who finds that his ship’s posi-
tion is in the middle of India and who
shifts the rubbish from his bath only
when it is needed to transport penguins
for sale in Sydney, There is also a leg
of mutton which the cook had forgotten
to thaw before roasting, “nicely^ done
and sizzling on the outside while the in-
terior was still frozen hard.” There are
penguins, about to take to the water,
pushing one of their number off their
ice to see whether or not he would be
eaten by a sea-leopard ; petrels spitting
on intruders with accuracy and copious-
ness ; and—for detail on the grander
scale—the birth of an iceberg:
Just as we were about to turn in a
sudden, prolonged roaring made us start
to our feet and rush outside. Away to
our right beyond the bend of the bay the
coast was in sight, and a mile or so away
sheets of spray flew high in the air. A
great mass of ice, broken off from the
harrier, rose high above the waves, then
plunged downwards until it was almost
submerged. Then up again, first one side
and then the other, while all the time a
noise as of concentrated artillery fire filled
the air.
Coming out just -when Australia is
sending another expedition to the An-
tarctic, the publication of South with
Maw son has been nicely timed for
topicality. But it would be a readable
book at any time and in any country,
and might well take a permanent, if
minor, place among the literature of the
Antarctic.
Magic, Black and White .
Furze Morrish’s The Ritual of Higher
Magic (Robertson and Mullens, Ltd.) is
an interesting if somewhat bewildering
book, which deals with magic, spells,
psychology and ethics, all of which, it
seems, relate to ritual.
Magic, as Mr. Morrish uses the word,
is an embracing term; advertising, to a
degree, is magic ; a base form of it. Free-
masonry, if not actually magical, at least
uses ritual which has magical significance.
It is a form of white magic. Christianity,
too, is a very potent form of beneficent
magic.
With much of this, of course, there is
little to quarrel; but the author, while
using the word magic in an embracing
sense, yet retains a special significance for
it in its application to ritual. Ritual,
he observes, is more than an act of faith;
at least, he concedes the faith, but for his
purposes is not concerned with it; what
interests him is the mechanics of the
ritual. But to accept his conclusions some
elements of a different sort of faith are
needed.
Accounts of the Eleusinian Mysteries,
the Osiris and Isis mysteries—later
debased—and the influence of Mith-
raism, make fascinating reading. Where
the modern reader finds difficulty
in going all the way with the author is
where he presents pre-history casually as
history, on the evidence of clairvoyant
experience: as, for example, a description
of dark ritual in “Lemuria” —“a continent
lost several million years ago, and stretch-
ing from somewhere near modern Malaya
to southernmost Australia,”
Voodoo, since it is still practised—in
the author’s opinion, in a disguised form,
in modern jazz—is more credible. Here,
Mr. Morrish attaches great significance
to the word itself. “OO” and “V,” for
instance, have great power on the psychic
body (particularly the solar-plexus) and
“D” has a percussion effect. All of which
is somewhat difficult to follow without
reference to the author’s theories (which
have some reference to Yogi principles)
concerning the astral body.
Returning to modern psychology
(which, in the author’s opinion, is doing
good work, but limping several centuries
behind occult science) there is an interest-
ing section of Chromotherapy the
science of healing by colors. Here Mor-
rish leans heavily on Dr. J. Dodson Hessey
(M.R.C.S., L.R.C.P.) and on recent treat-
ments in psychiatry. And he observes,
truthfully, that these scientific principles
were utilised, if not properly recognised,
by the ancients, and by the Christian
Church.
In the main, his scientific attitude may
be summarised in the quotation on page
seven:
Today the mass mind seems to have
reached the materialistic attitude and accep-
tance which leading scientists attained half
a century ago, but today Science has
officially discarded its materialistic basis
As early as 1929 Sir Arthur Eddington, in
his book Science and the Unseen World,
repudiated materialism on scientific grounds.
About the same time Sir James Jeans did
much the same thing, and attributed the
formation of the universe to some vast
“thought in the mind of a Creative Genius,”
an altogether unthinkable conclusion 50
years earlier. Alexis Carrel, member of
the Rockefeller Institute, in his book Man
the Unknown makes the illuminating
comment that there are plenty or scientific
workers but too few real scientists
This, clearly, is the author’s opinion.
And clearly, too, there is something in it.
But whether the author himself can be
classified as belonging to the magic
circle of scientists who find the truth far
ahead of the herd is dubious.
Some of his conclusions seem to be
definitely unscientific. But one can, at
least, be grateful for his definition of
modern jazz, and for the unconscious
humor of his description of its effect on
the psychic body—in the region of the
solar-plexus.

Things that Crawl
By J.B. BLAIR
J.B.BLAIR
There was a
spirit of calm
in the .Noyse
household.
That general state-
ment needs, perhaps,
some slight qualifi-
cation. In the
kitchen Mrs. Noyse
was making pre-
liminary preparations
for the evening meal
and 18 - month - old
Richard, crawling
around her feet, was
busy at his self-
imposed task of re-
arranging the sauce-
pans. This entailed
pulling down to the
floor every pot
within reach, hurl-
ing the lids to the four corners of the
room, crawling after them, then trying by
a system of trial and error to fit the right
lids on the right saucepans.
If, as was usually the case, he picked
a misfit his first impulse, instantly obeyed,
was to smite the pot lustily with the lid
in an effort to batter it to the required
size. When that failed, he would hurl
the lid from him with a howl of baffled
infantile rage and seize another.
Mrs. Noyse, accustomed to the
sport, scarcely noticed the clatter and
din, except when a yell in a different
key told her she had
trodden on the
fingers of her v off-
spring or when,
moving from bench
to stove, she trod
on an artfully mis-
placed saucepan
and felt its rim bite -
into her ankle.
Through the open
window came the
varied sounds that told her that the rest
of her brood were still alive and com-
paratively whole Patricia’s shrill
soprano, the domineering voice of David,
striving to impose his will on the others,
and the joyous shouts or calf-like bellows
of four-year-old Tony, whose tempera-
ment knew no in-between seasons, but
alternated between brilliant sunshine and
cloud-emptying rain.
The fourth voice that filtered through
to Mrs. Noyse belonged to Ross from
“up the street,” a solid lad who at six
was bigger than Patricia at nine. It was
his voice that, raised to a higher pitch
than usual by the urgency of its message,
caused Mrs. Noyse to look up from her
work and glance out through the window.
“Quick!” he was shouting. “There’s
one! Get a stick!”
“I’ll get the shovel,” volunteered David.
“Yes, the shovel’ll do. Or the axe.”
Tony’s voice chipped in. “I will get
the bucket.”
Her interest aroused, Mrs. Noyse
walked out into the yard. Richard flung
down the saucepan of the moment and
followed her as far as the back step,
which he was accustomed to use as a
grandstand, from which to observe the
backyard sports of his seniors.
As Mrs. Noyse stepped on to the lawn
a whirlwind flew past her and resolved
itself into David armed with a spade
and Tony lurching along dangerously
with an axe,
Patricia in the meantime had found
a piece of paling and was rushing back
to where Ross seemed to be standing
guard behind the lettuce patch. Ross
seized the paling from her as David
arrived with the spade.
“Let me. I’ll get him,” David panted,
with bloodthirsty relish.
“Look out!” shrieked Ross, “He’ll
get away!”
MRS. NOYSE shuddered. She had
decided that it must be a rat, or a
mouse. She regarded both rodents with
utmost horror, but her sense of duty
took her to the spot where David and
Ross were lunging with spade and paling,
with Tony running around the outskirts
of the fray dragging his axe.
“David! Ross! Stop it at once,” she
commanded. “What on earth have you
got there?”
But the thrill of the hunt deafened
the boys. Mrs, Noyse appealed to
Patricia,
“What are they chasing?”
“A snail,” said Patricia.
“What?”
“A snail. It’s a big one . . . There
it is! ” she shrieked, pointing her finger.
David bent down. “Get your paling
under it, Rossie.”
Puffing with excitement Ross obeyed.
“Now tip it on to my shovel.”
This manoeuvre was successfully carried
out and the hunters stood up, glowing
with pride and with the thrill of the
“Shall I chop it?” asked Tony, draw-
ing near with the axe. “No, no!” yelled
the other two boys.
“Put that axe down at once,” said Mrs.
Noyse.
“Can’t I give it just a little chop,”
pleaded Tony. “I won’t hurt it,” he
added mendaciously.
Mrs. Noyse removed the axe to save
further argument.
“What are you going to do with it?”
she asked.
“Here’s the bucket,” announced Tony.
“Put it in the bucket.”
David tilted his spade and shook the
prize into the bucket, taking care not to
touch it with his hands.
“Isn’t it a big one?” he said. “Have
you ever caught as big a one as that,
Mummy?”
Mrs. Noyse admitted she hadn’t.
“What are you going to do with it?”
she repeated.
“Rossie’s going to take it to school,”
said David.
“What for? Nature study?”
Ross was scornful. “No, not Nature
study.” The reply implied that that would
be the last reason in the world for
taking snails to school. “It’s to feed the
tortoise.”
“Oh! So you’ve got a tortoise at
school?”
“Not me, but a girl in 2A brought a
tortoise to school and it eats snails.”
Mrs. Noyse was quite impressed.
“Well, you are a thoughtful boy,” she
said. “That’s a very good idea.”
Ross’s round face beamed with pride,
but with his next remark his halo slipped
a bit.
“Yes, and I’ll get a coming-out-early
mark for it, too.”
This was foreign talk to Mrs. Noyse,
but David translated for her.
“If anyone gets all their sums right,
or all their spelling, Miss Pavy gives
them a coming-out-early mark and when
it’s time for school to come out they
come out five minutes before the others.”
“I see, but where does the snail come
into it?”
“Well, sometimes Miss Pavy gives a
coming-out-early mark for other things.”
“What sort of things?”
“Things like bringing flowers for the
room. Last Wednesday Robert Fletcher
got a coming-out-early mark for bringing
flowers.”
DAVID shrieked with excitement.
“Ross, Ross. I’ve got a good idea.
We’ll catch a lot of snails and you can
get a whole lot of coming-out-early
marks.”
“Yes, so I can,” Ross agreed.
David warmed to his idea. “Yes, if
we catch five snails, she’ll give you com-
ing-out-early marks for five days, or we
can get ten and that’ll be ten days, or
we might get twenty and that”
Ross chipped in, catching the excite-
ment. “We might catch a hundred.
Gee, fancy a hundred coming-out-early
marks!”
“Or a thousand,” said Tony.
“Don’t be silly,” admonished his
brother. “There wouldn’t be a thousand
snails in all our garden.”
“’Praps there might,” said Ross, who
was already visualising himself as a
coming - out - early-
marks millionaire.
“Quick! We’d better
start looking.” He
peered into the
bucket Tony was
holding.
“Quick! Give me
that stick. It’s get-
ting out.”
The captive had
crawled a few inches
up the side of the
bucket. Ross
prodded it cautiously
and it fell back to
the bottom.
“We mustn’t let
it get away,” said
David. “We’d bet-
ter put a lid on the
bucket.”
His manner was that of a big-game
hunter who has trapped a lion in a pit
and contemplates presenting it to a
National Zoo. He picked up a piece
of tin and placed it on top of the bucket.
“That ought to fix him,” he said with
calm satisfaction. “Let’s catch some
more.” f
“If you really want snails,” said Mrs.
Noyse, “try the bean patch.”
The children rushed over to the bean
patch and struck gold at once.
“Look at them!” shrieked Patricia.
“Bring the shovel, David.”
APPARENTLY the idea of picking up
a snail with their fingers had not
occurred to any of the children; they
preferred the cumbersome method of
pushing the creature on to the spade
with a paling, then shaking it into the
bucket.
“Use your hands,” Mrs. Noyse
suggested.
Patricia shuddered.
“Oh, Mummy, I couldn’t.”
Tony made to pick up a snail. David
quickly knocked his hand aside.
“Don’t, Tony, don’t,” he shouted.
“Why not?” asked his mother.
“’Cause he’ll get warts,” said David.
“Warts? Why?”
“For picking up snails.”
“Where on earth did you get that
idea?”
“Well, I thought everyone knew that,
’cept Tony p’raps. Snails give you warts
on your fingers.”
Mrs. Noyse determined not to tolerate
superstition.
“Nonsense, I’ve picked up hundreds of
snails and I haven’t got warts on my
hands.”
David was not convinced.
“But you’re a grown-up,” he explained.
“What’s that got to do with it?”
“Grown-ups don’t get warts.”
Mrs. Noyse did not argue that point,
but returned to the main issue.
“Anyway, it’s wrong, David,” she said.
“Snails don’t cause warts. It’s quite safe
for you to pick them up.”
“ I’m not going to pick any up,” said
David. “Billy Hayes in our class used
to pick ’em up and now he’s got warts
all over his hands. Truly he has.”
’ “Yes, but that doesn’t prove the snails
caused them.”
“But I’ve seen the warts. That proves
it.”
“I’ve seen them too,” supported Ross.
“All over his hands,”
In the face of this convincing evidence
Mrs. Noyse decided it was useless to
argue, so she left the snail-hunters to
their sport and returned to her kitchen.
Through the window drifted as before the
remarks of the children. Snail-hunting,
it appeared, like other sports, had
developed a jargon of its own.
“Quick, here’s a big father snail”—
“Get the shovel, here’s a mummy one”
—“Patwicia, help me get these two little
baby ones in the bucket.”
Urgency seemed to be the keynote of
the game. Shrill screams from time to

Victims oi a “Murder Hun”
On your right is the battered “face”
of one of Australia’s finest, pre-war,
natural-rubber tyres. On your left
the pointer indicates the still smiling
“face” of a tyre not so well known —
yet! That’s because it’s a NEW
Dunlop development in tyre con-
struction ... a tyre well-named
Dunlop “SUPER 90.”
Both tyres were new before their
tyre-crippling run on the test car.
All the punishment that a motorist
can give his tyres in their normal
lifetime was “dished out” to them
in a concentrated test . . . savage
acceleration, fierce braking, fast
cornering, high speed over rough
cross-country roads for 24 hours a
day —five days a week. To equalize
the punishment, tyres were changed
from wheel to wheel daily. The
photograph above was taken at the
end of their “murder run.” It
provides a dramatic illustration of
the tremendous increase in tread life
given by the new DUNLOP “SUPER
90” . . . the first entirely new-design
tyre produced in Australia for nearly
10 years!
The long life of the new “Super 90 ’
is due chiefly to 3 fundamental design
features : High-Profile Casing, Tread
Rubber in Compression and New
Design Tread. The result is a car
tyre that will give longer life and
greater mileage than any previous
tyre at NO EXTRA COST!
At the moment, only limited supplies
of these wonderful new Dunlop tyres
are available. But more and more
are being distributed to Dunlop
dealers throughout Australia.

time denoted that another snail had been
detected in the act of rushing for cover,
and fierce yells of exultation indicated
that it had been surrounded and over-
come by force of numbers.
After a while the tumult of the chase
died down a little, and Mrs. Noyse, gaz-
ing out of the window, saw that the field
had moved to the bottom of the garden.
There was quiet for a space, except
for Richard, who had returned to his
saucepan-bashing. Then, through the
window came David’s voice raised to a
pitch of great jjrgency:
“Quick, Rossie, he’s in the incinerator
and I can’t get him out.”
“Tony,” thought Mrs. Noyse, and her
fears were immediately confirmed by
Ross’s reply:
“I’ll get your mother. She’ll get him
out.”
As Mrs. Noyse ran out through the
back-door, Ross came towards her,
shouting;
“He’s in the incinerator, Mrs. Noyse.
Will you get him out?”
Mrs. Noyse ran to the incinerator and
peered in. All she could see was a mass
of garden refuse.
“What are you talking about?” she
asked.
“That whopping big snail. He’s a big
grandfather one.”
He pointed to an outsize snail parked
comfortably on the inside of the in-
cinerator. At the same moment Tony
came out of the cubby-house in the
corner. -
Relieved, and accordingly annoyed,
Mrs. Noyse turned to the older boys.
“Why can’t you get it out yourselves?”
she asked.
“Warts,” said David.
HIS mother detached the snail from
his squattery and went inside again.
The grandfather snail apparently satisfied
the hunting zeal of the children for the
time being, and a few moments later they
were pestering her for a cardboard-box
to put the snails in.
Mrs. Noyse gave them a shoe-box, and
after punching a few holes in the lid and
lining it with some of the choicest lettuce
leaves they could find they emptied the
catch from the bucket into the box.
Not long afterwards Ross departed with
his booty, leaving David and Patricia in
the middle of complicated calculations as
to the worth of the snails in coming-out-
early marks. The problem was trans-
ferred from the mental plane to the more
practical level of counting off days on
the kitchen calendar.
“Thirty-seven there were,” said David,
“not counting the three baby ones. I
don’t think Miss Pavy would give him a
coming-out-early mark for a baby snail.”
“But what about the grandfather one?”
protested Patricia. “He ought to be worth
two coming-out-early marks.”
“I don’t think she’d give two for one
snail,” said David. “P’raps we’d better
only count one.”
“Well, we ought to count one for the
baby snails, too,”
The point decided, they ran their
grubby fingers over .the calendar until
they agreed on a date on which they
considered Ross’s credit in coming-out-
early marks should expire. After much
argument and an adjustment for week-
ends and Christmas holidays they fixed on
another, checked and rechecked it and
still got the same result.
“Gee!” said David. “Fancy getting
coming-out-early marks right up tifi
February.”
Patricia agreed that it was something
only to be dreamed about and Tony, who
didn’t know whether February was a day
of the week or the name of the grand-
father snail, tried to explain to Richard
how lucky Ross was.
The children moved on to some other
game and there was no more talk of snails.
Next day the thought of Ross and his
coming - out - early marks crossed Mrs,
Noyse’s mind a couple of times and she
meant to ask the children for the sequel
to the hunt when they came home from
school. Other things crowded it out of
her mind, and, the children making no
mention of snails or Ross, the subject did
not come up for discussion.
After the youngsters had gone to bed
Mr. and Mrs. Noyse listened to the radio
for a couple of hours, then they too
turned in.
JUST how long Mr. Noyse had been
asleep when he heard the shriek for
help he had no idea, but he sat up in bed
with a shock.
“It’s Tony,” said Mrs. Noyse, rather
unnecessarily.
“Mummy! Somefing’s crawling all
over me.” The cry rang out again.
“I’ll go,” said Mr, Noyse, getting out
of bed.
He made for the
boys’ room and
fumbled for the
switch. As he
groped for it his
bare foot trod on
something which
crushed, wet and
clammy, beneath
it. Involuntarily
he stepped away,
only to tread on
another horrible something. His first
thought was of eggs, but the light re-
vealed two crushed snails. Tony was
sitting up in bed, rubbing his face.
“Daddy, somefing crawled over me,”
he said.
His father picked his way to the bed-
side through a way strewn with, snails.
It was a horrible sight. There were snails
crawling all over Tony’s-bedclothes, there
were snails on his bed-head, on his
pillow, among his blankets and in his
hair. Their paths of slimy silver were
criss-crossed all over the wall behind his
bed and the two that Mr. Noyse had
trodden onjvere only the advance guard

U.S.-SOVIET FRONT-LINE.
Along a front-line that can be drawn
on the map the U.S. and Soviet Russia
face each other, with the Soviet ambition,
if not intention, to move further forward
than it has already done by outright an-
nexation and by control enforced by
threat, and the declared U.S. policy to
face direct expansion with force and in-
direct with dollars. '
The map line shows both how wide the
Soviet expansion has already extended
and how far-flung are the U.S. boun-
daries of containment, fixed in some
places by the accident of post-war occu-
pation, in others by deliberate extension
of U.S. lines of defence, in some others
by the co-operation of countries acting
in self-interest both against the Soviet
threat and for their own recovery in
accord with the “Truman doctrine”
and that “doctrine’s” extension the
“Marshall plan,” now up for Congress
decision.
Though not manned at all points by
troops of the opposing sides, the line is as
distinctly the division of the two worlds
as if the troops were there. How far the
Soviet might yet be able to extend active
control at some of the points without
provoking war is uncertain, but that the
set-up for war is present, requiring only
sufficient provocation, looks as positive as
anything of the kind could be. The posi-
tion, as reviewed in a “United States
News” survey, is that “All round the
world the U.S. and Russia are pressing
solidly up against each other. If there
is any more shoving, trouble can result.”
An incalculable factor in the set-up is
the will of the American people to give
all the support needed to uphold the posi-
tion of their country as a great world
Power daring to take the risks involved
in that role. There is still strong isola-
tionist feeling in the U.S. ; showing itself
in the consideration of the European
countries’ bid for aid under the “Marshall
plan” and in preliminaries of the Presi-
dential election, which, though a year
ahead, is already the paramount issue
inside the U.S.
“The extent to which the United States
has moved out into the world,” says
“United States News,” “is not too well
understood by the American people.”
That authoritative publication’s survey of
the scene, with the division at all points
hardening rather than showing any sign
of easing, has the interest for others be-
side Americans that it could be a mapping
of tomorrow’s battle-lines:
In Europe the boundary of U.S. involvement
is clear. U.S. troops are in Berlin and plan to
stay there. They are in Western Germany and
are co-operating closely with the British. The
boundary of U.S. influence thus is sharply
defined as the western border of the Russian
zone. In Austria, too, U.S. influence is main-
tained by occupation troops eastward as far as
the Russian zone.
Trieste forms the southern end of this con-
tinuous U.S., frontier through Central Europe.
That seaport city now contains about 5000 U.S.
troops, is clearly out of bounds for Soviet
expansion at this time.
In the Balkans the American sphere now ex-
tends to a line formed by the Yugoslav-Greek
and Bulgarian-Greek borders. Above that line
Russia is entrenched through Communist Gov-
ernments in Rumania, Albania, Yugoslavia and
Bulgaria. Below the line the U.S. is officially in
Greece with missions and arms, so that further
extension by Russia in this direction could lead
to an open conflict.
In the Middle East a new U.S. military mis-
sion and shipment of arms to Turkey are re-
garded as lining up Turkey with the United
States. The boundary runs from Greece
across the northern border of Turkey to the
Black Sea. There Iran falls within the U.S.
sphere with an official military mission. Saudi
Arabia, too, finds itself in the U.S. world, with
U.S. economic interests established there and
with a large U.S. military air base at Dhahran.
Backing up American influence in this part of
the world, furthermore, is a U.S. fleet stationed
in the Eastern Mediterranean.
In Asia and the Pacific U.S. and Soviet in-
terests again press together. India, while it
remains in the British Empire, falls within the
U.S. world at Russia’s back door.
China remains in the U.S. orbit, even though
American forces are largely limited to a naval-
training mission at Tsingtao and a small mili-
tary mission at Nanking. The boundary of
U.S. involvement thus follows China’s
northern border, so that Soviet troops face
trouble with the U.S. if they should decide
to aid Chinese Communists openly against
Central Government forces
Korea is sharply divided into U.S. and Rus-
sian spheres. The equivalent of three U.S.
divisions occupy the southern half of the
peninsula, facing about 13 Soviet divisions in
the northern half. The line of contact here is
the 38th parallel, beyond which neither country
may extend its sphere with safety.
In the Pacific the common frontier leaves
the Eurasian mainland for the first time. The
U.S. is in Japan, in Okinawa, in the Aleutians
and in Alaska with troops, ships and planes.
But in the middle of this area Russia has an-
nexed a former Japanese island chain, the
Kuriles, and has taken over all of Sakhalin
Island, north of Japan. Moreover, Russian sub-
marines are reported operating in this section of
the Pacific.
From here the boundary runs north through
the Bering Strait, where Russia itself extends to
SOVIET AND U. S. PRODUCTION, 1940 AND 1947

for United States production in 1947 are in most cases based
on first five or first six months of this year.
within 40 miles of U.S. territory at the tip of
Alaska.
In the Arctic, frontiers of the two spheres
meet in vast polar wastes, with both sides ex-
tending their positions toward the North Pole.
On the American side the United States is estab-
lishing permanent air bases in Alaska and
Maine, an Arctic naval base at Newfoundland
and scheduled weather flights in the polar area.
The U.S., too, is retaining its Joint Defence
Board with Canada and at present is complet-
ing blueprints for advance air bases in
Northern Canada in case of war.
In regard to the statement in the fore-
going that “U.S. troops are in Berlin and*
mean to stay there,” this is held to de-
pend on the outcome of the London
Foreign Ministers’ meeting. A London
“Times” special correspondent has com-
mented that in the event of continued dis-
agreement among the parties “the Allied
Control Council would become super-
fluous and, willingly or unwillingly, the
Western allies would abandon their posi-
tion in Berlin.” A British official broad-
cast has stated that the British will stay
in Berlin “so long as Germany is occu-
pied on the basis of present agreements,”
but the “Times” correspondent reports
“an acute fear” among Germans that Ger-
many will remain divided, with those in
Berlin abandoned to the Russians. This
fear the correspondent described as “part
Of the hysterical fear of another war.”
In regard to the reference to Trieste
as “clearly oilt of bounds for Soviet ex-
pansion at this time,” the general accept-
ance is that this is a quarter loaded with
dynamite, which a slight detonation could
set off. There was very close to an “inci-
dent” at the changing of the occupation
boundaries, when, at night, a column of
Yugoslav lorries appeared at one frontier
post, announcing their intention to march
on into Trieste, There were only a dozen
American troops at the spot, but they
“were under quite firm instructions not
to let the column through.” Anything
could have happened, since the Americans
intended carrying out their orders, and the
death of one American there would have
meant war; but the Tito force caved in
before the dozen. In the U.S.-Soviet
“front-line” of antagonism Trieste re-
mains as a recently-returned London
“Times” correspondent describes it; “this
cramped and explosive corridor of
Europe.”
In its own hemisphere the U.S. posi-
tion has been greatly strengthened by the
initial joint-defence moves linking ail the
Americas practically as a unit; moves
which look certain to be firmly estab-
lished into a common doctrine next year.
The standardised arming of the Ameri-
can Latin nations by the U.S. has been
going on for some time. They have
already received an estimated $65,000,000
in surplus U.S. arms and are due to get
upwards of $400,000,000 more in
weapons, planes and naval equipment.
In a weighing of the respective
strengths of the two worlds “United
States News” sees that of the U.S. as
containing 85 per cent, of the wealth and
industrial power: “Its military strength
lies in a powerful navy, a small but
potent air arm and especially in its vast
industrial power. Its weakness lies in
the ability of pro-Russian Communists
to penetrate the sphere, to influence and
even upset the Governments within the
U.S. world.”
On the other hand, the Russian world
is comparatively poor, its strength lying
in its “Communist fifth-column, its 3QO
divisions of fighting men, its 10,000-odd
military aircraft. But that power lags
far behind the vast industrial and scien-
tific potential, for war or peace, of the
U.S. sphere.”
With Soviet Russia so dependent on
the activities of its Communist fifth-
column in other countries, “The Western
world,” London “Times” has com-
mented, “will watch with redoubled cau-
tion the Communist parties now active
outside the frontiers of the Soviet
Union.” As the Canadian spy trials
showed, the fifth-columnists could be
safely counted on by Russia to act as
traitors to their countries.
Among other things, the whole set-up,
says “United States News,” means that
“occupation forces must remain indefi-
nitely in Germany, in Austria and in
Korea, where neither side will feel free
to withdraw its troops.” Hence, “Small
boundary incidents will take on great sig-
nificance” and “could easily tumble the
world into another devastating war.”
Against that possibility is the oft-
repeated fact (for what it actually may
be worth) that “no nation wants war.”
Writing on that theme N. Y. “Times”
military correspondent Hanson W. Bald-
win comments in the “Times Maga-
zine” :
There is war weariness among the people of
the world; the Soviet peasant and the American
laborer troth want bread and peace.
Nor do the Governments want war at this
time. The objective of the American Govern-
ment is to avert war —not to precipitate it —but
our leaders do not believe this can be done by
appeasement or weakness. The men in the
Kremlin also hope to avert war—though for
different reasons. They are leading from weak-
ness and they know it.
To keep Americans up to the collar in
their nation’s new world role, there has
been a lot of emphasis on U.S. military
weakness by both military and political
leaders, with the danger that it might be
taken at face value in Russia. Holding
that “there has been far too much talk
about American weakness,” Baldwin,
after an inspection tour of the whole
U.S. defence, makes these comparisons;
In a military sense we [U.S.] still are the
greatest Power in the world—potentially and in
many ways actually. Our Army is smaller than
the Russians, but considerably better equipped,
and it has ‘ vast reserves of war veterans and
material behind it. Our Air Force maintains
fewer planes in operating squadrons, but has
more planes in storage and reserve, and we
have incomparably better planes and pilots and
technique; the Russians have < no strategic
bombing force worthy of the name, and their
air force is technically and tactically obsoles-
cent.
Our Navy is larger than all the rest of the
navies of the world; we could use the seas for
our purposes and deny their use to Russia. We
possess atomic bombs, probably numbered in
two or three figures; Russia has none. Our
industry is incomparably superior to Russia’s;
factories and transportation systems are un-
damaged by war; in developed resources we
are far ahead of the Soviet States. [Chicago
“Tribune,” incidentally, quotes a U.S. Depart-
ment of Commerce section dealing specially
with Russian trade as finding that “Russia’s
industrial capacity cannot sustain a major war
within the next 25 years, and probably not for
50 years.”]
In contrast to U.S. strength Russia shows
definite weaknesses. She maintains the largest
army in the world —a definite index of her one
advantage of mass size. But it is an army
indifferently equipped. Many of its members
have become aware during their service beyond
Russia’s frontiers that the Soviet Republics are
militarily backward compared to many of the
States that border them; desertion rates have
been high.
Russia also has major internal problems. The
harvest this year appears to be good, relieving
the near-famine conditions of last winter, but
the post-war Five-Year Plan for the expansion
and reconstruction of Soviet industry and trans-
portation is far behind schedule. Russia re-
ceived terrific damage during the war, and it is
by no means repaired. Some of her people are
weary of privations, and the Ukraine, the
Crimea and some other sections contain dissi-
dent elements.
In another article Baldwin commented:
“More than 1,500,000 men under arms
and more than $10,000,000,000 for a
defence budget do not represent ‘weak-
ness’ in any country on earth.” He also
stated that “Russian industry today—con-
trary to popular impression—is far more
concentrated and more vulnerable than
American industry ; it could probably be

Mr. Churchill has said wisely enough
that “there is no reason why a two-world
system should lead to war”; but de-
liberate provocation could certainly do
so, and under the present divided dis-
arrangement the risks of such provocation
seem only too tragically obvious.
CHINA MYTHS.
Writing from Weihsien to demolish
some myths about China’s Communists,
Scripps-Howard correspondent William
H. Newton states that, far from the Com-
munists being “beloved by the common
people of China,” the facts are that the
Communists are greatly feared by rich
and poor alike.
Newton reports, as an example, that
the city of Yitu has been occupied by
the Communists for the past six months:
“During that time all business ceased, all
stores were closed, mission schools and
hospitals were shut and a great many
people fled. The same thing happened
in Linchu and in village after village.”
Of another myth, crediting the Com-
munist army with being a “people’s army”
—“an expression of the rebellion of the
ordinary peasant against the Nationalist
Government” —Newton declares:
I talked to - dozens of Communist army
prisoners captured by the Nationalists after the
battle of Linchu. Scarcely one had any idea
what the word “Communism” meant. Most
had been forced into service and compelled
to fight. A few were former' Nationalist soldiers
who had been captured in previous battles
and compelled to fight the Government.
The correspondent sums it up in a
couple of sentences: “When the Com-
munists take a town the people flee. And
when the Nationalists take it back, the
people come home again.”
EXPULSIONS.
At Lausanne, after the other World
War, Lord Curzon spoke of transfer of
populations; he called it “the jnost
vicious ‘peace’ solution I know of,”
Lord Curzon had seen nothing; even
Hitler would appear to have been a
mere experimenter compared with those
responsible for the expulsions sanctioned
by the Potsdam Agreement —of course
with the pious stipulation that the “trans-
fers” were to be effected “in an orderly
and humane manner.”
Just how “orderly and humane” it has
been “Wall-street Journal” correspondent
Joseph E. Evans has exposed in one of
a series of articles on post-war Europe.
Evans quotes from a report prepared by
the refugee committee of the Council of
States in the U.S. occupation zone in
Germany, adding comment based on his
own observations:
“Millions of people,” the report notes, “on
the basis of this agreement, suffered complete
expropriation and removal from their native
soil. This compulsory mass removal, which
may occupy a unique place in the history of
the world, has been effected, particularly in its
early stages, under circumstances which can be
called anything but ‘orderly and humane.’”
Suggestive of the kind of humanity involved
is the fact that “a large percentage of the ex-
pellees (at least one-third) arrived without any
baggage whatever, the luckier ones with 50 kilos
(100 pounds) and only the very few recognised
anti-Fascists from the Sudetenland equipped
with some household goods.”
To view this in its proper perspective it must
be remembered that “a large majority of the
expellees were neither minority groups abroad
nor settlers sent by Hitler to populate conquered
territories, but represented an indigenous popu-
lation most of whose ancestors had settled there
700 years ago.”
The report does not argue, and this corre-
spondent is not attempting to argue, that the
Germans in the Sudetenland and Poland were
free of political sin. Many of them, though
by no means all, were more fanatical Nazis
than those in the Third Reich. It is the prin-
ciple of mass expulsion, however, which is at
fault: the whole idea that any permanent
or satisfactory —not to mention moral —solution
is to be achieved by tearing millions of people
out of century-old social and economic con-
texts and dumping them into an area incapable
of supporting them. •
The report suggests the notable failure of
Greece to assimilate the million or so Greek
refugees it had to take from Turkey in 1922.
Quoting from the “New English Weekly,”
the report says that few of these Greeks re-
fitted themselves into national life. “They
mostly settled in shacks on the hills around
Athens, where they remained an unhappy mass
of humanity, productive of little but anarchic-
Bolshevist agitations. They did much to pro-
mote, if not create, the lively discord in which
Greece has lived ever since.
In Germany it is not a question of a million
or so refugees but of 12 million. When one
recalls, as the report does, that the United
States, with its vast area and prodigious
wealth, is dubious about its ability to accept
400,000 displaced persons, how is it to be sup-
posed that a Germany which never produced
enough food for its population and which has
now lost one-fourth of its pre-war territory and
28 p.c. of its arable land, can absorb 12 mil-
lions?
It was never originally intended that such vast
numbers of people would be affected. The
Allied Control Council’s programme, drawn
up in November, 1945, to implement the Pots-
dam decision, figured on a total of 6,650,000
a fantastic enough number itself —to be dis-
tributed throughout the four occupation zones
of Germany.
Where are the other 5,350,000 coming from
—for they are still coming? The answer to
that concerns one of those misinterpretations of
the Potsdam agreement which have had such
edifying results in the last two years. Potsdam
made it as clear as anything very well could
be that the western frontier of Poland was not
fixed. It said that, pending the final determina-
tion of that frontier, the territories east of the
Oder-Neisse rivers should be under Polish ad-
ministration. The Poles, with Russian support,
took this temporary arrangement as being the
de facto final determination of the frontier.
So they immediately started kicking Germans
out. The German provinces east of the Oder
and Neisse had a population of 9,338,933, of
whom the expellee report says 188,597 “de-
clared the Polish language to be their native
tongue.” As a result, the Control Council esti-
mate of a total of 6,650,000 expellees has
already, in less than two years, been greatly
exceeded.
Evans quotes the report as summing
up: “The severe psychological shock
caused by the expulsion and the manner
in which it was carried out in many
cases resulted in despair, disinclination to
work and lack of initiative.” That is in
accord with Evans’s comment on the
report that “the severity of its indictment
is enhanced by the very temperateness of
the language used,” for what has been
done in the name of Potsdam- has caused
alarming increases in diseases and has
had disastrous effects on health; and at
that neither the report nor Evans men-
tions what is certain to be the most
lasting and serious result —the implant-
ing of hatreds that will one day seek
revenge,
“The evacuations,” Evans caustically
comments, “started on November 20,
1945 ; curiously enough, the same day on
which the victorious Allies started trying
a group of men in Nuremberg for cer-
tain crimes, among them mass removals
of populations.”

“Unconditional Surrender.” These fateful
words, with their effect of prolonging the war
and thereby influencing the nature or tne
“peace,” are described by Raymond Swing m
the “Atlantic Monthly” as a Roosevelt im-
promptu! According to Swing, they were just
tossed off by Roosevelt at Casablanca on Janu-
ary 24, 1943: “Mr. Roosevelt had not been
authorised to lay down peace terms on behalt
of the Allies. No message had passed between
Washington and London defining the final con-
ditions on which ultimate surrender would be
accepted.” Mr. Roosevelt simply ad libbed
the words at a press conference.

Garbage Bureaucracy. —lf he could have a
look at his England these days Browning might
change his tune to “O to be in Iceland” or

holders. Almost any day Government in-
spectors are likely to visit your house and ‘lift
the lid’ on the slop-pail. Trouble awaits one
who has carelessly failed to segregate potato

feed.”

Congress Goes Slow. —Mr. Truman and his
advisers did some hard thinking before the
President called the special Congress to deal
with aid for Europe, London “Times” Washing-
ton correspondent commenting that “Mr. Tru-
man’s courage is being praised”; “It is believed
to be political suicide for the President to call
a hostile Congress, because he has no chance
of limiting the subjects to be discussed. Ine
fact of how very slowly the Congress wheels
turn—“even under the pressure of great events
and crying need,” as N. Y. “Times” says
made the choice inevitable: It was on Jan.
30 1946, that President Truman recommended
the British loan to Congress, and not until
July 13—165 days later—that Congress gave
him a completed bill. And it was on March
12 of this year that the President proposed to
Congress the adoption of the ‘Truman Doc-
trine’ of urgently-needed aid to Greece and

Blundering Planners. N. Y. “World-
Telegram” financial editor looks at the Bntisn
scene and finds some consolation for America.
“Britain has tried ‘soaking the rich’ and she
has tried Government planning, but the best
efforts of the do-gooders have done no more
than aggravate an already bad situation.
Economists have pointed to blunder after
blunder these planners have made since they
took over the reins of Government, but the
real answer probably is to be found in the
fact that no group of men is smart enough to
manage ,a nation’s entire economy. Americans
have much to be thankful for in the fact that
the British people were willing to act as guinea-
pigs in this all-out experiment with Govern-
ment planning. Many in the U.S. were clamor-
ing a short time ago for the same sort of deal.
We had a taste of it, to be sure, but not enough
to throw our economy into a tailspin.”

Wanted, a Superman. —Setting up the Free
Territory of Trieste was easy enough; just a
matter of ignoring Danzig and any other like
lessons of history and performing a final stroke
or two of the since-disqualified Moscow crawl.
Finding a suitable Governor for the nice
U.N.O. powder-keg would also be easy if the
crawl hadn’t been banned. As it is, reports a
London “Times” correspondent, “The Great
Powers have gone through a whole album of
respectable neutrals without managing to agree
upon a suitable Governor. The West are afraid
of a ‘fellow-traveller’; the East of a ‘reaction-
ary.’ ” The Governor will have on his
hands, in general-managing for U.N.0., the
job of trying to. reconcile, within the space
of the powder-keg, “not only two nations the
Italian and the Yugoslav—but two worlds and
two ideologies which have so far evaded recon-
ciliation almost everywhere else.”

Silence for Attlee—A London correspondent
of “Wall-street Journal” notes a sign of the
greatly changed popular feeling in Britain:
“There seems to be no question but that the
Labor Government is losing popularity. In
London movie theatres Prime Minister Attlee s
picture on the screen brings silence, Churchill s
thunderous applause.”

Finland Next.— On reports he has received,
a Hearst’s correspondent in Europe asserts tnai
Finland is in grave danger of becoming the
Greece of the north. “All eyes are on Greece
while Moscow is silently busy preparing to con-
struct another bastion of Red Russia’s strategic
security system extending from the Bering Strait
to the Norwegian frontier.” As was done in
Poland, Rumania, Hungary and Bulgaria, and
has been attempted in Greece, “Finland is to
be conquered from within.” It might prove
a contract, the Finns being very much opposed
to any Communist control.

All for a Penny. Bairnsfather and others
have pictured the British as sardonic stoics
in war-time, and the spirit isn’t dead. In the
midst of the worsening shortages (which merit
a grimmer name) London “Times” letter-writers
have been indulging in what might be called a
feast in reverse; recalling in detail all the
separate things that once, amazingly, could be
bought for a penny. A few samples: A dozen
boxes of matches, four candles, two eggs, 21b.
of potatoes, 11b. of bread, lib. of apples, ilb.
of tomatoes, a large cabbage, four fresh herrings,
71b. of coaK One writer having listed a baked
potato “from the man at the corner,” J.
Middleton Murry, “in the interest of historical
accuracy,” wrote remembering that the price
of the baked murphy “was a halfpenny and
not a penny, and it probably weighed 6oz.
at least.” The very small list of what can
still be had for a penny includes admittance
to Kew Gardens —to “enjoy a feast of beauty”!
—and “in nearly every part of the country,
outside London, one still rides for a penny,
and for the same distance as before 1914, on
bus services run by the provincial omnibus
companies.”

Jap “Invincible” Notion. The myth Hitler
worked on, that the German Army wasn’t
defeated in 1918, has its counterpart in Japan,
according to a London “Times” correspondent s
report. Referring to a claim by Tom Hagiwara,
chief of the treaty bureau at the Jap Ministry
of Foreign Affairs, that his statement that
“Japan had not been conquered” had been
misconstrued, the correspondent comments: ‘ln
spite of this denial, the fact remains that, even
after two years of occupation, the Japanese
people en masse are convinced that they were
not defeated and that the war was ended
through the Emperor’s benevolent intervention.

Turn Against Labor. —The general mass of
reports by American correspondents in London
agree that in Britain the people are fairly
longing to smack the Labor Government into
the outer with their votes. As merely typical,
Sam Boal, of N. Y. “Post,” reports that ‘ a
large section of the British population is right
now pretty sick of the Socialist experiment,’
adding: “Possibly no Government in recent
British .history came into power with greater
mass support; the social revolution was here,
chums, and by next Thursday every problem
would be solved. Two years later the average
Englishman looks at himself in the mirror and
he finds he hasn’t got a head any more. What
did it? He doesn’t believe that the Russians
or the bothersome Jews in Palestine or the
sunspots did it, although some Socialist Ms.P.
tend toward this view. All he can do is to
blame his Government, and I have never seen
so many Englishmen so shrill and so unanimous
as in their blame of the Labor party right now.”

J. Bull’s Burma Defence. —Though by the
treaty arrangement Burma is, unlike India, clear
outside the British Commonwealth and all the
few thousand British and Indian troops stationed
there are coming out, a British Joint Service
Mission will, by Burma Government request,
be sent in. It will include, says- London
“Times,” instructional and other staff for ser-
vice with the Burma forces. Training facilities
for members of the Burma forces are also to
be provided in British establishments; the
Burma Government agrees that it will not re-
ceive a Defence Mission from any Govern-
ment outside the British Commonwealth; air,
land and sea facilities are to be made available
to Britain in certain circumstances, and Britain
is to give financial and other assistance for
the upkeep of airfields in Burma and will hand
over free of cost 37 small warships at present
on loan.

Religion in Yugoslavia. The report of a
bunch of American churchmen (subsequently
debunked as Corns or next-door), who affected
to have been convinced by Tito that “there
is today in Yugoslavia complete freedom of
worship and respect for religious beliefs and
institutions,” has been crushingly attacked in
N Y “Times” by former Bishop of New
York William T. Manning. Urging all those
who want the truth to read Ally Betrayed:
The Uncensored Story of Tito and Mikhailo-
vich, by David Martin, with a foreword by
Rebecca West, Bishop Manning comments: At
this very time, while this group of ministers
have been in Yugoslavia as the guests of Tito,
there are living here in New York as refugees
two great Serbjan Bishops, Nicholai of Ticha
and Ochrida and Iriney of Dalmatia, both of
whom have endured the horrors of concen-
tration camps, one at Dachau and the other at
Bari and one of whom, Bishop Nicholai, has
been internationally known, and loved, and
honored, since the days of the First World
War The present ‘religious freedom’ in Yugo-
slavia is such that if these two heroic Bishops
should return to their people in Serbia, by
whom they were and still are deeply beloved,
they would have no reason to expect any other
treatment than that given to their friend and
brother in spirit, the martyred General Draja
Mikhailovich.”

AERIAL DUSTING OF CROPS AT NARRABRI
This Tiger Moth, under charter to East-West Airlines, is seen travelling at 70 miles
an hour only one to three feet above Mr. Noel Barrett’s linseed crop as No. 1 3
D.D.T. dust is sprayed. Aerial dusting of linseed crops in the Pallamallawa and
Narrabri districts is claimed to have achieved great success in destroying the
caterpillars which soon wipe out linseed crops if not controlled. Experts predict
that aerial dusting has a great future in Australia.
Letter from Mr. J. Noel Barrett to Taylor’s Paints Pty. Ltd.
Your Mr. Brabham has asked me to advise you about the results of the
D.D.T. •
In checking the tomato grub on the linseed crops, the D.D.T. 5 p.c. was
applied at the rate of approximately 1 51bs. per acre by air and about 201bs. per
acre with ground control. The dusting by air was about 95 p.c. effective,
and the ground dusting as far as is known a 100 p.c. job.
All things considered, I am very satisfied with the results, and I particularly
wish to express my appreciation of the interest Mr. Brabham has taken in
the work.
Yours faithfully,
(Sgd.) J. NOEL BARRETT.

THIS COMMUNIST
PLAYGROUND.
The Federal executive of the A.L.P. at
Canberra conducted a post-mortem on
the corpse of the Cain “Labor” Ministry
in Victoria. There was no denying from
the autopsy that the creature died of
wounds caused by premature explosion
of the Ten-year Socialisation Plan during
the handling of its detonator, the socialis-
ation of the trading banks. There had
been much combustible stuff carelessly
left lying about, such as fag-ends of
Labor-“ Communist” strikes; and the ex-
plosion was thus greatly assisted.
The conductors of the post-mortem,
including the Prime Minister, absolved
themselves from responsibility, congratu-
lated Mr. Chifley on his experiment—
though not without inquiring how far
he proposed to pursue it —and blamed the
unhappy accident upon “false and mis-
leading propaganda” imposed upon the
intended victim, who was meanwhile
thoroughly enjoying the spectacle. So
much for public consumption. Privately
the meeting, one of “the general staff” of
political “Labor,” developed distinct
signs of alarm. Besides the Cain
Ministry other casualties, known or
likely, are:
The Bank Grab Bill itself.
Solidarity of “the movement.”
Further steps in the Ten Year Plan.
Prices and Rent Control referendum.
Caucus members, letting themselves go
in Parliament, assumed an air of confi-
dence and enthusiasm, but their private
sentiments are much akin to those of Mr.
McAlpine, with whose presidency of the
A.L.P. executive last year was initiated
the “programme for attaining democratic
socialism in a way acceptable to the
people” (or so hoped). What Mr. Mc-
Alpine told the Canberra post-mortem
convention was that “the Banking Bill
is the greatest political issue in Australia’s
political history, and... . the ‘Labor’
movement is fighting for its existence.”
So Victoria rammed home that truth at
any rate.
With reasonable prospects that chal-
lenge of the Bank Grab Bill in the Courts
may assure the people a chance to vote
on it at the next general election, one
resolution of the Canberra mating was
that “immediate steps should be taken
to rally the ‘Labor’ movement behind
the legislation.” Mr, Chifley’s own ad-
dress to delegates urged that the party
should “fight” for the Bill, leaving “the
subject of nationalisation to fade, as far
as possible, into political obscurity”
(“S. M. Herald” report). Significantly it
is the “Labor” movement that must be
'rallied. And that “next step,” socialisa-
tion of insurance companies, is now out.
The executive reminded Mr. Chifley of
the agreement to bring that on promptly
after the banks had been extinguished ;
but “our leader” peremptorily quashed
that. His attitude is—“ For the love of
Pete, keep it out of sight; it’s hard
enough for the time being to get the mob
to shape up to the Bank Bill whole-
heartedly.” And so into that “political
obscurity” in which the whole socialisa-
tion objective lay for a generation
or more, the Ten-year Socialisation plan
is now thrust back until the time is ripe
to bring it out again.
That is how the politicals would like
to have it. But the unions have yet to be
heard from, and in'Caucus their outstand-
ing representative, the polished gentle-
man from East Sydney, does not believe
in obscurity for this programme. Mr.
Chifley’s exhortation to all assistants to
“go out and fight” is earnest enough.
There could be no better testimony than
Mr. Chifley’s own attitude today that he
knows the people are against him, and
that opposition will increase as time
passes.
Indeed, the Prime Minister himself is
wavering. Till a few months ago he
assured the country that the 1945 banking
legislation would enable him to “gear our
economy” to meet any “recession” —this
after taking a silent farewell of the
Golden Age he promised the country.
Then he abandoned that stand for out-
right expropriation of the trading banks;
and till a few days ago he was saying that
nothing less would serve than legislation
to give him, as Treasurer, power oyer all
banking, though under the Constitution
power over State banking he cannot seize.
Now he tells the A.L.P. meeting that his
banking policy “could avoid 60 or 70
per cent, of the effects” of a depression!
Upon what does he base such a calcu-
lation? He does not, he cannot say. But
he expects Australia to look on at the
tearing down of its financial structure, be-
cause —having learned nothing from his
attempts to run ships and coalmines and
from the insolvency of the State Govern-
ment railways and street - transport
services—he believes he “could avoid”
some of the features of a depression
—a depression which, whether inevitable
or not, is certainly "being hastened by the
crank schemes of himself and other
socialists and by the lag in industrial
production.
Meanwhile, in important matters Mr.
Chifley is abdicating to the Communists:
protecting them as a party, employing
them in the public service, choosing them
as overseas “representatives of Australia”
and in the trade-union world letting
them do whatever they choose to do.
Now the evil is abroad in all its arro-
gance. Communists here and in every
other country, in obedience to Moscow’s
orders, are openly plotting civil discon-
tent and disorder. In France and Italy
strikes and riots have been fomented to
disrupt public services as a forerunner
to revolutionary action; this is Russia’s
reply to Western Europe’s declaration of
intention to unite for economic recovery
under American financial aid. The civil-
warmongers have concentrated on the
transport, fuel, and power services as
those in which the community is most
vulnerable. It is no mere coincidence
that precisely the same tactics have been
followed in Australia.
In Europe the avowed objective has be-
come the sabotaging of the authority of
elected Governments, the paralysing of
Parliamentary rule and the installing in
their place of union juntas set up by a
strictly regimented minority. Most Aus-
tralians are probably still under an illu-
sion that Mr. Chifley and his “Labor”
team of Ministers are governing this
Commonwealth. Let them cast their
minds back to the exposure of any such
illusion as provided by the Commo-run
wharfies’ union, which determined Our
Foreign Policy towards the Dutch in
Indonesia; by the Commo-run coal-
miners, who have extorted every pos-
sible concession in wage-lifts, subsidies,
holidays and their own arbitration tri-
bunals, all by dint of deliberately with-
holding coal from industry—and, with
every demand granted, they still with-
hold it; by the Commo-run Seamen’s
Union, which has forced job-control of
shipping, refused to man the Corio in
defiance of an Arbitration Court judg-
ment in favor of the boycotted engineers
that it undertook to respect, and is
still extorting war-risk bonuses from the
feeble “Government.” Let them recall
the late Victorian railway strike, when
the Communist leader of that effort
(Federal President Brown, of the A.R.U.)
announced that buses would run on his
permission only.
The same Comrade Brown sought a
“correction” from the Melbourne
“Herald” the other day of his reported
statement that his union would organise
“economic industrial action” against Vic-
toria, South Australia and Westralia if
those States should undertake co-opera-
tive action against the Bank Socialisation
Bill. How far the Melbourne paper was
off the mark was shown by a repetition
in Sydney a few days later, from the
N.S.W. State secretary of the A.R.U., a
Mr. Ferguson, M.L.C., that plans for just
such action had been discussed in Mel-
bourne and would be further examined in
Sydney. In Queensland this same union,
which does not hesitate to fine its own
members for offences against its rules,
staged last week a 24-hours strike —in
defiance of the Railway Commissioner’s
authority and of an Industrial Court order
—because the Commissioner had imposed
fines of £5, the least of penalties open to
him, on railwaymen guilty of breaches
of discipline.
Another outrageous instance of the
evil is the dominance of the Miners’
Federation over Mr. Chifley in its quarrel,
now made his also, with the Queensland
“Labor” Government. The N.S.W.
miners, having put Australia under bond-
age to themselves in the matter of coal—
production of which is deliberately re-
stricted to prevent accumulation of any
reserves by industrial consumers —have
been rebuffed by Premier Hanlon in their
bid to bring Queensland’s open-cut coal-
getting under control of their own N.S.W.-
Federal Board. Northern State coal
could liberate Australian industry from
its thraldom to the N.S.W. miners, Mr,
Hanlon has apparently dug his toes in
against accepting control by a board on
which Queensland’s delegates would be
outvoted. What is most astonishing, with
Mr. Chifley’s past laments for lagging
production in Australia, is his tacit sup-
port of N.S.W. miners’ Communist leaders
against Mr. Hanlon. The Brisbane
Trades Hall’s dictum is that “the N.S.W.
coalminer is satisfied with the joint board
and that should be sufficient.”
It should indeed be sufficient to put
“Labor”—if not past praying for—and
certainly the mass of the public, on the
alert against Communist usurpation,
through the unions, of the political gov-
ernment of this Commonwealth. There
is a one-day strike threatened in Queens-
land for next Monday on this control-
board issue, and the N.S.W. miners pro-
pose a general strike from the day after
the expiry of their Christmas holidays—
the duration of the holidays determined
by themselves —if the matter is not settled
on their own terms.
There is only one effectual cure for this
sort of union insurgence—aimed against
the Government and the community—
and that is legislation on the lines of the
Taft-Hartley Act in the United States.
If that example were followed in Aus-
tralia union bosses would be obliged,
under severe penalty, to file regularly-
audited accounts of their funds, could be
sued for damages on “illegal strikes” (and
all strikes by Government employees
would be specifically banned), would be
prevented from fighting another set of
union bosses for the body and soul of
some borderline members, and, above
all, would not have any standing in arbi-
tration grievances where executives in-
clude any member of the Communist
party.
That legislation has been found neces-
sary in the United States to uphold demo-
cratic government and protect the national
economy against assaults by powerful
unions; necessary as a provision against
civil war. It is as necessary in Australia,
and the Liberal and Country parties will
have to recognise the fact, if Australia is
to be spared what France and Italy are
going through now, and what further
calamities may be in store for (hose
countries.
Birds of a Feather.
lx says little for the daily press that the
whole country is not rocking with cynical
laughter at the antics of the Federal
A.L.P. executive, which held its half-
yearly meeting in Canberra contempor-
aneously with the passing of the Bank
Grab Bill by the House.
In 1945 and 1946 the Federal A.L.P.
executive plumped for wholesale nation-
alisation, It proposed to send delegates
abroad to study the modern technique of
destroying capitalism, and it ordered the
preparation of a “comprehensive publica-
tion, to be officially recognised as a
standard treatise for socialism in Aus-
tralia.” It arranged for the propagation
of plans for early socialisation of the
Commonwealth in accordance with the
ideas of Mr. Ward, who had declared in
1943 that the country could be organised
only “by very radical changes—by
socialisation.”
At the November, 1947, palavers,
though the delegates were in the main
the same as those present at the 1945 and
1946 meetings, with some shift towards
extremist control, the gentlemen would
have dived panic-stricken into the
Molonglo in a body if the word “sociali-
sation” had been favorably mentioned.
And if the chairman had attempted to
rule, as was ruled at the last triennial
A.L.P. conference —the decisions of
which are still live and operative, despite
anything the Federal executive may do—
that A.L.P. members may associate with
Communists in industrial conferences and
in the A.C.T.U. the cries for sal volatile
would have been heard in Cape York.
One particular resolution last week
was a gem:
This Federal executive again affirms its
determination to maintain the Australian
way of life. We emphatically declare our
unqualified opposition to all forms of
totalitarianism, whether it be Fascist or
Communist, lowering as they do the dignity
of man and frustrating the development of
human contentment and personality, the
continuance of which is the basis of our
national existence. Furthermore, we re- ;
pudiate the Communist party and all for j
which it stands.
This nonsense was taken solemnly by
the press. It was retailed without a
chuckle, even though four members of
the Trade Union Advisory Committee
which assisted the late Prime Minister to
conduct the war were members of the
Central Committee of the Communist
party. And it was passed only a few
months after the official “Standard”
vigorously defended the dispatch of the
Communist Thornton as a delegate to
conferences in Europe and rejoiced at
the decision of the Federated Miners,
whose president was a member of the
Central Committee of the Communist
party, to “affiliate” with political Labor.
While treating Communists publicly as
rivals and fighting with them for the
credit of introducing socialisation —the
objective of both parties—the “Labor”
party, so called, is becoming so like the
Communist party in technique and organ-
isation that it is difficult to tell the differ-
ence between the two. Both apparently
accept the dictum of Lenin that any de-
ception is justified which furthers party
ends.
So Dr. Evatt may feel no call to
blush in 1947 when he looks back on his
war-time statement that “Labor is
opposed to National Security Regula-
tions, except where they are essential for
the prosecution of the war, and is pledged
to revert to legislation in the- normal
manner as soon as war exigencies permit.”
Under the new system of “Labor” neither
the doctor nor his leader need have any
qualms about having, in 1943, given the
pledge that “under a ‘Labor’ Government
there will be more room for private enter-
prise and business initiative after the war
than ever before.” And if last year’s
policy speech lured the electors into be-
lieving that there would be no further
interference with the trading banks and
private enterprise, so much the worse for
the electors.
It is, however, in the structure of the
“Labor” party that the developments are
most sinister. The first essential of real
democracy--the essential, in fact, upon
which the old Labor party was construc-
ted —is that the greatest number of in-
dividuals should play the greatest pos-
sible part at all times in the movement
and in the government of the country.
This is directly opposed to the Com-
munist and the new “Labor” concept of
“democratic centralism,” in which the
power of the masses is concentrated in
a dictatorship which brooks no rivalry
and no opposition.
Such is the Communist theory which
so-called “Labor” has adopted and en-
forces, And the worst feature of it is
that the prime movers in destroying the
local influence have been delegates from
State A.L.P. branches, who have betrayed
their trust.
During 1945 the A.L.P. Federal
executive secured for itself amendments
to party rules which established a centra-
lised office in Canberra, controlled by the
executive. This office became the only
authority to “convene any meeting or
conference to deal with any matter affect-
ing the policy or platform of the party,”
and was given “plenary powers between
triennial conferences for making deci-
sions which should be finding on all
members concerning any matter” which
the executive should regard as affecting
“the general welfare of the Labor move-
ment,” In the Federal executive were
vested full powers to interpret the plat-
form and to “direct members in accord-
ance with the principles of the party.”
In the latest extension and interpretation
of these powers Federal members of Par-
liament have been rendered immune from
instruction by A.L.P. branch executives.
As virtually all the higher offices in
Government and party are held by
N.S.W. appointees Governor-General,
Prime Minister, Deputy Prime Minister,
leader of the Senate, Speaker and presi-
dent of the Federal A.L.P.—this means’
that the moderate States have become
subservient not only to a centralised
Federal body but largely to the whims
of the most extreme industrial State.
They have been sold into that bondage
by their own delegates, who are helping
the State branches to commit political
hara-kiri.
Before long State Labor bodies will
find themselves completely in the grip of
a totalitarianism modelled on that of the
Communist party which these moder-
ates:” of the Central A.L.P. pretend to
condemn. As matters stand today Com-
munists or moderate “Laborites” could
take oven their supposed adversaries and
continue to operate as before without
altering a single rule in their respective
constitutions.
$ What Federal “Labor” has just done
to centralise itself the Communist party
' in Australia did only two or three years
ago in exactly the same way. The
“Labor” move is linked with plans for
increasing the size of Parliament, which
will mean bloating the already inordinate
power of the cities in which Communists
have their headquarters at the expense of
the country.


PLAIN ENGLISH
"The Abbey Makes Us We."
For a thrilling hour last Thursday the
English-speaking world —and much of
the rest of the world —forgot current
trials and tribulations to listen to a broad-
cast of the wedding of Princess Elizabeth
to the young naval officer known to Aus-
tralians, as to a host of others, as Lieu-
tenant Philip Mountbatten, and before
the ceremony named Duke of Edin-
burgh, Earl of Merioneth and Baron
Greenwich by his Majesty the King.
All London had turned out on that
grey November day, and all London, to-
gether with the rest of Britain and the
Empire, gave overwhelming testimony of
loyalty to and affection for the Throne.
To the British themselves, as well as
to their friends and enemies, the demon-
stration was deeply significant. With
Communist civil war threatening the
French and the Italians, with England
herself in trouble, but not trouble of that
sort; England, harried by shortages, her
finances crippled, her industries threatened
by theorists, herself frequently charged
with being finished as a great Power —in
that hour England showed the world that
“She’s .England yet,” inspiring, in-
domitable, indestructible.
Nobody with imagination could wit-
ness the ceremony or listen to the record
without being aware of the grand
background of the centuries; without
being moved by a thought for the future
Queen, going from the old Palace to the
old, old Abbey, and of the royal house
that stands like stone. The Princess was
as nervous as any young woman might
be at her wedding ; the service—as the
Archbishop of York said—was “the same
as for any girl in a remote village in the
dales.” Yet for millions throughout the
world it was a reaffirmation of faith.
And the radio was not found wanting.
From Mallacoota to Hall’s Creek, from
the Leeuwin to Cape York and in all
settlements between, Australians' heard
the service, the responses, the prayers and
the hymns as if they had been in the
Abbey itself.
The Country to Chifley.
In the last Victorian Assembly “Labor”
held nine of the 30 country seats, and
three of the nine were represented by
members of the Cabinet —Dundas by
Attorney-General Slater since 1917, Won-
thaggi by Mines Minister McKenzie
since 1927 and Midlands by Transport
Minister Stoneham since 1942. In other
Parliaments “Labor” held other country
seats, and on November 8 it contested
24, the average enrolment being 14,400.
Successful or unsuccessful it polled
a strong vote in 1945, and at a 1947
election held on ordinary issues it could
reasonably look forward to winning 13,
or even 15, of the 30 country seats.
But in the Assembly elected that Black
Saturday “Labor” will have only one
(1) country member, Mr. Stoneham. With
40 ballot-papers reserved for re-examina-
tion, he scraped back by 61 votes in an
effective poll of 14,019 ; two years ago the
effective poll was 12,787 and the Stoneham
majority 3117. His two fellow-Ministers
were thousands up in 1945 (Mr. Slater s
majority indeed was just on two to one)
and thousands down in 1947.
The reversals were almost as great in
the cases! of the six rank-and-file mem-
bers who accompanied Mr. Slater, Mr.
McKenzie and Deputy-Premier Field
into oblivion. In all other cases the Op-
position majorities ranged from two to
one to several hundreds. At previous
elections there was a great loss of non-
“ Labor” preferences to “Labor,” but this
time C.P. preferences went solidly to the
Liberal candidate or vice versa.
“Labor’s” country-town vote, its great
standby in the past, slumped everywhere,
even in the coalmining part of Won-
thaggi, which had a Communist for
branch secretary of the Miners’ Federa-
tion—the gentleman, an immigrant, is
now general secretary, with headquarters'
at Sydney, and issuing threats and ulti-
matums galore. This was the country
towns’ reaction to the threatened loss of
their trading banks and of one of their
traditional liberties. Boxes from farming
districts completed the rout. Almost
without exception they went heavily
against “Labor,” in some cases refusing
the “Labor” man a solitary ballot-paper.
Such is country feeling in Victoria,
and beyond doubt it is the- same in all
the States, In his egotism and his con-
tempt for other people’s rights, Mr.
Chifley has lit a fire of indignation in
the country which won’t be put out until
inland Australia is delivered from the
excesses of city “Labor” politicians and
Communist-led mobs.
"The Most Unkindest Cut."
When the N.S.W. Legislative Council
blocked the Local Government Exter-
mination Bill by passing an amendment
referring the measure to a select com-
mittee there was general approval in
municipal circles in the County of Cum-
berland at the first ray of hope or sanity
they had glimpsed since Minister Cahill
first brought his /unpopular love-child
before Parliament. Mr. Cahill had begun
by appointing a royal commission of
three members who submitted to him
three separate recommendations, none of
which he adopted, preferring instead to
present a half-baked scheme of his own
concocting.
His tried and trusted majority in the
Upper House let him down. The
tried and trusted majority was Mr. Tom
Murray, friend of Mr. Chifley, and
hitherto regarded as being good-as-
“ Labor.”
Good-as-“ Labor” also was —and is—
the absent-on-a-dollar-tour Parry, now re-
cuperating after the strain of the Sydney
Land Sales inquiry. Mr. Parry was until
recently Mayor of Canterbury, one of the
municipalities spared from extinction
under the new Bill—others included
Bankstown, Premier McGirr’s stamping-
ground, and Mosman and Strathfield,
the two municipalities most vocal in their
opposition to the Bill. Although absent
in parts unknown, Mr. Parry’s vote was
not lost to “Labor” ; he was paired with
“IMPERIALIST WARMONGERS, HERE WE ARE!”
sick-member Speck. Party numbers in
the Council are evenly divided; it all
depended on “Tom.” Mr. Cahill could
be excused for thinking that Mr. Chifley’s
friend would do the right thing. To the
Cahill mind must have come back irresis-
tibly the Council vote on the Parliamen-
tary-pensions racket. When that division
was taken Tom Murray’s name was
among the Concannons, Daltons, Glee-
sons, McGirrs, McNamaras, Mahonys,
Mullinses, O’Deas and Maloneys.
Last week, alas, the Murray vote was
agin ’em, and Mr. Murray was telling the
Council he was “convinced that the refer-
ence of the bill to a select - committee
would make possible the production of
a measure that would do justice to a
Greater Sydney.” Next day Mr. Cahill
was silent. Possibly he was looking up
Caesar’s remark when stabbed by Brutus ;
possibly he was looking up other classical
stabs in the back ; possibly he was looking
up Tom Murray.
In its baffled rage the “Government”
is “deferring” the December County of
Cumberland elections on the existing
boundaries and rolls —“deferring” them
for a twelvemonth.
"Danger-money."
Mr. Hamilton Knight, one of the ex-
ponents of the new “streamlined arbitra-
tion” —Dr. Evatt’s name for it—was
N.S.W. Minister of Labor and Industry
for upwards of six years. He resigned to
become one of the new Commonwealth
Conciliation Commissioners, explaining,
first, that he was ready to make a financial
sacrifice for higher considerations, and
then that his doctor had warned him he
might have a breakdown unless he took
something soft or softer.
Mr. Hamilton Knight had to deal with
the claim of the crew of the Reynella, a
war prize, for “danger and discomfort’
money. The Reynella piled up on a
Papuan reef on August 18 and was
there till September 18. Thereupon re-
floated and temporarily patched up in
Deboyne Lagoon, “40 miles from the
reef,” she was taken in tow, reaching
Sydney on October 16. Her crew claimed
“danger and discomfort” money for 58
days and got it under the Hamilton
Knight award, as 1 per this “schedule”:
Two and six an hour, all hands, for
58 days. Twenty-five shillings an hour for
cargo-shifting and motor-room work, 25
days. Fifteen shillings an hour for cargo-
shifting and motor-room work in Deboyne
Lagoon. Seven and six an hour for watch-
keeping, handling towlines and motor-room
operations during the tow to Sydney.
Thirty shillings an hour for diver’s mate.
To Sydney wharfies, who declared
the vessel “black” on her arrival with
6000 tons of sold “Disposals” stuff, more
danger-money was awarded “as a result
of negotiations between representatives
of the Waterside Workers’ Federation
and representatives of Mr. Chifley’s
Shipping Board” —7s, 6d. an hour to one
gang, 4s. 6d. an hour to another, plus
ordinary pay. These claimants had con-
temptuously refused “an extra rate of a
shilling an hour” awarded by a Reference
Board on the ground that the work,
though not dangerous, was “unreason-
ably abnormal and unusually obnoxious.”
A naval seaman comes in here;
The crew of Reynella were stranded for
three or four pleasant weeks on Jomard
Island. We went aboard with a 251 b.
scuttling charge to try to shake her free.
The ship was wedged hard in the coral.
There was not much of a list, and the
vessel was fully protected by the island
from the prevailing sou’-easter and by
the arm of the reef from rough seas. She
lay there perfectly secure, for’ard bulkheads
holding, in balmy conditions such as
Hollywood spends millions of dollars to
portray.
Men of my ship worked day and night
trying to haul her off. High tide was mid-
night when we began our pull, preparing
wires, splicing parted strands. We even
sent over two sugarbags full of fresh fish
to ease the “discomfort.” In between
tides we were tugging at the tanker Cyrena,
reefed 170 miles to the north. But no
praise or commendation was mentioned or
expected by the R.A.N. The servitude of
the sea is austere, and its comradeship once
was equally pure. Now, under the in-
fluence of poisonous Communist doctrines,
it i» different.
Only a trifle of prizemoney has been
or will be received by the officers and
men of the Royal Navy, to say nothing
of the R.A.N. But two crews supplied by
the Communist - controlled Seamen’s
Union could live in comfort for years
on what they got in “danger and dis-
comfort” money from the owners of the
Wanganella and the Reynella—in the
latter case the people of Australia.
McGirr Finds Friends.
When the McGirrs, of Sydney, intro-
duced their bill to slap penal taxes on
N.S.W. intra-State airlines, because the
Government railways are losing money
hand over fist, Mr. Treatt (Liberal) and
Mr. Bruxner (Country party), forgetful of
all they had said about free enterprise,
supported them.
Mr. Treatt: I entirely agree with the
proposal that the Government should con-
trol intra-State aviation. It would be an
extraordinary thing to deprive the Govern-
ment of the right to impose appropriate
fees in appropriate circumstances. Under
the existing Road Transport Act it exer-
cises that right over motor vehicles, and it
was intended to exercise it over aircraft.
Mr. Bruxner, for his part, said some-
thing about “the measure clearing up
the position whereby the Commonwealth
Government has taken advantage of
regulations dealing only with safety con-
trol to try to take charge of intra-State
air services.”
The Road Transport Act, which, in Mr.
Treatt’s elastic imagination, gives the
Government the “right” to impose penal
taxes and which, with even more elas-
ticity, he believes was “intended” to cover
air transport, was a Stevens measure and
Mr. Bruxner was Transport Minister
when it became law. But that didn’t
make it a good Act then and it has never
been anything but a bad Act, as is any
Act which directly halts progress and de-
velopment. The Stevens road taxes, like
the McGirr air taxes, were designed to
bolster up falling Government railway
-revenue. But Government railway
revenue persisted in falling, and, had it
not been for the war years, with their
enormous military traffic, heaven only
knows what the financial position would
have been by this. The McGirr air tax
won’t stop the railways from going deeper,
into the red. In a world of fast and
mobile transport the railway is being
relegated to a very limited field.
But it is the nature, not the purpose,
of this tax, which is indefensible and
which should bring men like Mr. Treatt
and Mr. Bruxner, leaders as they are of
parties pledged to the guardianship of
free enterprise, hotly up against it. It is
simply a tax to extract revenue from
enterprises which owe the State Govern-
ment nothing for their origin or develop-
ment and which are to get no service of
any kind in return for this special taxa-
tion. In other words, the Government is
taking upon itself the right to impose
penal taxation on any enterprise which
happens to be in the same line of business
as itself. Using its argument for airline
taxation it could clap penal taxes on in-
surance companies, builders (“control”
of building, with stiff fines, is now pro-
posed) and a host of other concerns and
people. Is Mr. Treatt in favor of that ?
One Grab Fails.
Quite apart from the allegations of
bribery which are to be the subject of a
royal commission, Tasmania’s Mr. Cos-
grove is having rather a rocky time with
his Transport Department. The Govern-
ment railways lost £327,418 last year—
£76,ooo more than for 1945-46. Reasons '
advanced were increased cost of materials
and fuel, increased wages and a falling
off in receipts from passenger fares.
Characteristically the Government de-
cided that it could do nothing about the
first two items and had better concentrate
on the third, waving a big stick.
About six weeks ago Transport
Minister Howroyd in a statement on
transport policy said Government road
services would be established between
Hobart and Launceston, Launceston and
Burnie, Burnie and Smithton, Launceston
and St. Mary’s and Launceston and
Herrick:
When the Commission, in pursuance of
the policy outlined, decides to operate a
passenger service over any route on which
a service is already being provided under
licence, the Commission will first approach
the operator and offer to purchase assets.
Failing satisfactory arrangements for pur-
chase, the Commission will operate a fair
competitive service, paying the same pas-
senger tax as private road operators.
When the Government’s Public Works
Execution Bill reached the Legislative
Council the Opposition objected to an
item of £367,200 listed for the acquisi-
tion of privately-owned road transport.
There were conferences with Ministers
and transport officials, but ultimately the
Council deleted the item and sent the
Bill back to the Assembly.
Mr. Lillico summed up for the Opposi-
tion :
If the Government wishes to nationalise
the existing services it should go to the
country and get a mandate, but if it goes
to the country I feel perfectly certain that
such a mandate will not be given, because
the people have had a sickening of social-
istic enterprise.
Not only the people of Tasmania but
the people of all Australia have had a
sickening of socialistic enterprise and
would like nothing better than a chance
to express its opinion through the ballot-
box As far as Tasmania is concerned
that opportunity will not come just yet,
but 1948 offers possibilities that must
have a dampening effect on the Cosgrove
Government’s Christmas vacation. As
far as nationalisation of road transport
is concerned the Council has won its
point. The attempt to bring the measure
in by back-door methods has been aban-
doned and a Transport Bill will be sub-
mitted in February. That’s what Mr. Cos-
grove says now. By February he may
deem it wiser to forget all about it.

POLITICAL POINTS
The guillotine fallen and the Bank
Grab Bill through the House, “Labor”
members raised a disorderly cheer. It
recalls Walpole, who, when forced
into a silly war by mob passion and hate,
said “They are ringing their bells now—
they will soon be wringing their hands.”
Fourteen defeated Victorian “Labor”
Assemblymen, three of them Ministers,
have done a lot of hand-wringing already,
and some of their friends who survived
the rout have turned savagely on the
Communist supporters of the Bank Grab
whom Chifley protects —if crawling to
them can be considered protection—and
whose foul Oriental conspiracy “poor
old Holloway” likened to the Christian
religion.
On a small poll, D’Alton, sometime
State Forestry Minister, Commonwealth
High Commissioner and absentee from
the Kirby inquiry, got in as M.L.C.
for Gordon (Tas.). Congratulations,
“Labor”!
Nasty anti-Menzies quips were attri-
buted to W. M. Hughes in other years,
one being “He can’t lead and he won’t
follow.” There was nothing nasty or
niggardly about Billy’s tribute to Bob on
his Bank Bill speeches!—“ln all my Par-
liamentary career,” unbroken since 1894,
“I have never heard better: I have heard
all the giants of the past, and Mr.
Menzies has out-topped them all.”
George Knowles, a good servant of
Queensland and Australia, has died in
harness as High Commissioner in South
Africa. Rosevear and Ward didn’t vote
him too old to be sent to a strange climate
at 64. To those politicians, flinging mud
from the floor of the House, only High
Court Justices' adjudicating in their own
country are too old.
An engaging recruit to the Rosevear-
Ward Youth Movement is Fred Ward,
one of the “new” Senators from South
Australia. A Fred Ward biographer says
Fred is rising 75, and he looked it 20
years ago. In his maiden speech in the
Senate he quavered that “Everyone op-
posing the Banking Bill should be charged
before a special inquiry with un-Aus-
tralian activities” and that Menzies
should be deported to Franco’s Spain.
Then he turned on the newspapers, paus-
ing to remember that “most of the re-
porters 'are strong ‘Labor’ supporters.”
The boy-Senator is right there, and some
of these “strong ‘Labor’ ” supporters are
still being allowed by indulgent editors to
present their “Labor”' geese as swans.
A.B.C. announced on Monday that
Chifley was going to take a house in the
N.Z. bush for a fortnight and there “for-
get politics! a while.” That same day
Communist bosses of the Miners’ Feder-
ation were shouting with frustrated rage
because Hanlon wouldn’t have their
Joint Coal Board in his State; and
Chifley can’t “nationalise” Hanlon.
In his J contest with the Communists
the Queensland Premier holds three
aces: (1) Enough easily-got coal to
’ supply all Australia; (2) An English
undertaking to work it; (3) Canberra
“Labor,” as well as Communists, is on
the run and can’t afford to offend
Queensland. About all the Communist
bosses hold is a busted flush in the form
of a threat to pull Queensland coalies out
on strike. You couldn’t expect
Chifley to buy cards in a set-up like that.
At least one of these union chaps has
no illusions about the bank grab. Coull
(Liquor Trades) told the Melbourne
Trades Hall Council that the thing needed
“debunking; it might provide a dole
wage and allow Mr. Chifley to become
the chief paymaster in a depression.”
Coull says he is a Socialist.
Nothing could be clumsier than Cal-
well’s handling of the affair of the Malay
seamen who married in Australia during
the war. It was a case for turning a blind
eye on an accomplished fact which could
neither be usefully mended nor ended,
but with those fine fellows the Indian
cricketers in Australia Calwell issued an
order for the expulsion of the seamen
with or (on the Russian model) without
their families —this while arranging to
admit more crates of Jews from Europe
and Asia, all of whom must have come
under the influence of ferocious anti-
British propaganda. When Dr. Evatt re-
turns he will find that all “Labor’s"
efforts to ingratiate itself with Asiatics,
by siding with the Indonesians and the
Dutch and by surrendering to Com-
munist control of Our Foreign Policy,
have gone west, and that the last state will
be worse than the first.
After what happened in the Reynella
case —members of the Seamen’s Union
aboard were awarded small fortunes for
staying on their stranded ship while the
R.A.N. got it off the reef and towed it
home, and Sydney wharfies were given
7s. 6d. an hour for working on her when
she got home—the skipper of the Murray
River paddleboat Marion had better
keep off the mudbanks around Gol Gol.
Matthews, the McGirr Minister for
Building Materials, has been studying the
example of the Chifley bank grab. The
man has come out with a bilf apparently
designed to give him “control” of every
rusty nail and left-handed tenon-saw and
every other blessed thing used in building
in N.S.W., along with all the factories,
workshops and yards in which building
materials are made. Matthews and his
mob will be dreadfully disappointed if
the bill goes through the Leg. Council.
What they are after is an excuse for non-
delivery of the 90,000 houses promised by
McGirr.
When the Head Serang of the Ration-
ing Commission learned that the N.S.W.
local-government elections were to be
held on December 6, he put the date for
issuing new ration-books a week forward
because the elections would occupy halls,
schools and so forth. But the McGirr
attempt to abolish 50-odd Sydney coun-
cils and make the great city a playground
for “Labor” aldermen was stoushed by
the Legislative Council, whereupon the
McGirrs postponed City of Cumberland
elections for a year. The Rationing
“heads” are still chewing it over.
The P.M. has assured everybody that
his monopoly bank will be “guide, coun-
sellor and friend” to its conscripted cus-
tomers, Australians have too long been
used to making their own choice of
guides, counsellors and friends to fall for
this rubbish.
Early in November there arrived in
Brisbane seven heavy-duty lorries fitted
with double-decked trailers carrying 57
new car bodies. They had come 1300
miles by road from Adelaide in seven
days. There was no shipping space, rail
haulage would have taken too long, and
the bodies were necessary to keep Bris-
bane motor industries at work. Depart-
ing from tradition, State transport author-
ities granted the convoy road-permission
and concessions on road tax. • Which
goes to prove something or other, though
what it is isn’t clear, except that there
are still people in Australia who manage
to get things done.
The great one-day strike prescribed for
the Queensland Government railways by
the A.R.U. for Tuesday of last week —
in defiance of the Full Industrial Court,
which issued an order restraining the
A.R.U. from striking unless a secret ballot
of all railway unions was taken —fizzled
out, most of the railwaymen staying on
the job. It was called in an attempt to
bluff the Railways Commissioner and the
State Government into depriving the
Commissioner of his right to inflict fines
on railwaymen guilty of breaches of dis-
cipline—in 1946 some of them were fined
for refusing to handle freight declared
“black” by striking meatworkers. When
the strike was decreed, Nolan, the A.R.U.
secretary, said he had the public with
him and the enthusiasm of railwaymen
for the strike had never been higher.
Nolan was proved wrong, and he and all
the mugs who fell for his bluff are now
liable to fines up. to £lOO. Queenslanders
are enthusiastic about that; they’ve had
strikes.
A Rationing Commission “official”
bobbed up in Queensland with the de-
claration that housewives were to blame
for the blackmarkets there, seeming to be
without scruples when they could get
food or clothing without coupons. The
“official” professed to be “amazed to find
how completely unmoral the average Aus-
tralian citizen is when it comes to ration-
ing.” What the man was “amazed” to
find was the delight the average Australian
takes in beating the bureaucrats.
Following the precedent set by the
Wharfies’ Union in taking control of the
Government’s foreign policy with its
bap—now over two years' old—on Dutch
shipping in Australian ports, officials
of the Government Railwaymen’s Union
in N.S.W. and Victoria are propos-
ing “economic sanctions” by their union
against three States if those States should
“fight the bank-nationalisation bill.” This
is one of the first fruits of Chifley’s in-
junction to his discomfited party to “go
out and fight the bill.” For the “Labor”
minority on this issue to “fight” opposi-
tion to this bushranging legislation is
quite right; for the indignant majority
to fight back is treason to the Trades
Hall. A perfect illustration of Commu-
nist procedure.
Chifley’s attitude reveals more and
more his conviction that it is not a
“Golden Age” but a depression which his
Government is leading in. “Labor” is
falling more and more under Communist
influence in the unions, as reflected in
Caucus. The depression is expected by
the Chifley crowd to arrive here through
infection, capillary attraction, or some
such reaction, from Europe; and in
Europe the economic prostration, worse
than anything the Continent has known
since the Middle Ages, is not only pro-
tracted but intensified by the Communists
to serve Russian ends. If Chifley were
really trying to ward off a Communist-
made depression in Australia he would
take swift measures to discipline the local
breed of these distress-mongers by means
of legislation on the lines of the Labor-
Management Relations Act of the Ameri-
can Congress.
From a publication called the
“Observer,” issued by A, D. Fraser,
“Labor” M.H.R. for Eden-Monaro, and
darling of the Canberra press gallery:—-
Friday saw a great expanse of the daily
press given to a series of minor incidents,
when Mr. Blain, the Independent member
for the Northern Territory, following a
charge that he had used his gold pass to
obtain preferential treatment when a
prisoner in Japanese hands, called Mr.
Mulcahy (Labor) a “mbngrel” and Mr.
Mulcahy later retorted that Mr. Blain was
of “low mentality.”
Who’s Who records that Fraser was 37
when the war broke out. While Blain was
in Sandakan and Outram-road jail Fraser,
eight years younger, was serving as
“president Canberra A.J.A., 1942-44,
president Federal Press Gallery, 1942-43.”
Somewhere about 1949 (or earlier) Fraser
himself will be a party to a “minor inci-
dent” in which Eden-Monaro will get an-
other member.
The dud Queensland railway strike was
a great day for the Irish. Nolan (Bris-
bane) ordered it, Hogan (Cairns) sup-
ported it. O’Malley appeared for the
Commissioner, O’Brien for the union,
and on the Bench sat Riordan and
Dwyer. •
“Liberal Opinion,” a new Sydney pub-
lication, got heavily home on Geraghty,
“Labor” M.L.A. for North Sydney, by re-
printing a Geraghty letter to a branch of
the Communist party in his electorate.
Booze and betting matters were thought
to be Geraghty’s main interests as a
“Labor” politician, but to his Communist
friends Geraghty confided his “sincere
hopes and trust” that “after the nationali-
sation of banking becomes law the next
move will be to nationalise the insurance
companies, breweries, coal and steel in-
dustries, and shipping.” As may be in-
ferred from his attitude to Communists,
Geraghty is one of those Catholic
“Labor” politicians who are poles apart
from the Cremean's.
Here and there you can still * come
across brave Catholic Labor members
who refuse to be seen in the same pad-
dock as Communists, though they are un-
discoverable at Canberra. One of them
is J. L. Cremean, who, faithful to the
memory of his brother, H. M., who died
untimely when Cain’s deputy, and whom
he succeeded, is carrying on the fight
against the Reds. At the declaration of
the poll for Clifton Hill Cremean de-
nounced Rosevear and Ward for their
attack on High Court Judges in the
Sydney larrikin spirit, going on to say
that “if Labor is to get anywhere it will
have to face the problem of reconstruc-
tion and begin an all-out offensive against
the Communists, which Labor leaders
should lead.” By a great effort Cremean
refrained from pointing out that where
Communists are concerned Chifley
“leads” in the Plaza Toro fashion.
Hanlon is signing an agreement with
the Electric Supply Corporation of Eng-
land by virtue of which the company
undertakes to spend £10,000,000 on open-
cut mining of Blair Athol coal and find
another £8,000,000 for colliers, if neces-
sary. He is to introduce the necessary
legislation immediately. It is a fantastic
development. No one could have im-
agined that English mineowners, driven
out of their own country by “nationalisa-
tion,” would seek and get concessions
from Queensland “Labor,” the first Ad-
ministration in the Empire to go in for
Government ownership of almost every-
thing in sight on a massive scale ; and
this when Federal “Labor” is set on
“nationalising” the trading banks.
When all the Victorian election returns
were in the Liberals had gained 14 seats
(12 from the “Labor” party), the Country
party had gained two seats, both from
“Labor” and “Labor” had lost 14 to both
parties. Dunstan is a member of the
composite Ministry. Since 1932 he has
been out of office for a trifle over two
years.
The Government at Canberra is not
only expelling 14 Malays, all British sub-
jects who married in Australia during
years of war service, but has ordered
the expulsion of 60 Dutch servicemen “be-
lieved to be in Brisbane.” Their crime is
that they “assisted to load and unload
ships under Dutch Army charter which
were blacklisted by Australian waterside
workers.” In short, the Government is
once more obeying Communist orders.
Something will have to be done about
these Evatt brothers. While the elder,
Chifley’s deputy, was denouncing Russian
policy in U.N.O, discussions, the younger,
McGirr’s boy, cast up at an Australia-
Russia Society meeting with a wholesale
denunciation of Russia’s critics:
Charges against Russia of warlike pre-
parations are slanderous. The Australian
people will refuse to be drawn by capitalist
conspirators into hostilities against Russia.
It is very satisfactory to see Russia and
Australia united in a realistic attempt to
end the slaughter in Indonesia. There is
Fascism in Australia; some supporters of
a private banking system are Fascists.
Before the echoes of this raving nonsense
had reached Lake Success or wherever
U.N.O. hangs out, the elder brother was
supporting a U.S.A. resolution calling off
the U.N.O. “struggle” against Franco-
yes, Franco.


NOT EXTINCT AFTER ALL.
“Mr. Chifley is going to New Zealand, at a time when ‘Labor’ has been routed in the N.Z. municipal elections, as it was routed in the municipal elections in France,
England, Wales and Scotland, and in the Assembly elections in Victoria.”
“You can’t square me with cheap Australian wheat!”

AND IT'S PRINTED

“Becks” : It is not surprising that the
Royal Wedding should have raised Lon-
doners in particular and English-speak-
ing people throughout the world to trans-
ports of enthusiasm; the wedding of an
heiress presumptive to the British throne
is something that never happened before.
Mary I and Victoria were married after
their accession to the throne. Gloriana
of course never married. Mary II
and Anne went to the altar while their
uncle Charles II was still reigning; their
father, later James 11, was heir presump-
tive, and there was the possibility that he
might yet produce a male heir, as indeed
he did in the person of “the warming-
pan baby” who became the Old Pre-
tender. The closest parallel to the wed-
ding of Princess Elizabeth and the newly-
created Duke of Edinburgh was the
match between Princess Charlotte and
Leopold of Saxe-Coburg, who was to be-
come Leopold I of Belgium. This took
place in 1816. George 111 was in his
dotage and Charlotte’s father was Prince
Regent, later George IV. The princess
was very popular and her wedding was
the occasion of genuine rejoicing; but
she died within a year of the ceremony.

“E. 8.”: East Melbourne’s famous
leaning trees, now fallen to the municipal
axe, were not in Nicholson-street (B.
12/11 /’47) but in Morrison-place, once
Brunswick-street South. I lived there 35
years ago, when the trees and myself
were young and upright. There is no
mystery in the cause of their leaping to
the centre of the street. Growth of leaf
and branch is most vigorous where the
light is strongest. The thickest, and
therefore heaviest, growth took place on
the sunnier side of each row, the extra
weight causing the trunks to incline in
that direction.

“Zake”; When I view an American
newsreel which shows a couple of
“famous” radio comedians in front of a
mike reading scripts of which they’ve
not written one word themselves, and
for which they’re paid a much higher
screw than President Truman’s, I ponder
upon an art that has become debased.
The old-time patter-comedians on the
vaudeville stage were comedians, and if
they weren’t they soon got the “bird,”
Over a quarter-hour act they’d toss be-
tween 1000 and 2000 words at each other,
accompanied by assorted grimaces and
expressions. The best of them wrote all
their own scripts and memorised every
word. And they could “ad lib.” bring-
ing in topical items as they went along.
How often have audiences seen shows
held up until other members of the cast
have sufficiently mastered their mirth at
the impromptu quipping of the comedian?
Compared with that this type of radio
fare is bloodless. The most pathetic
feature of it is that in place of the
animation that should accompany patter,
all the mike exponents of it can do is
look up every few seconds and gape at
the metal gadget a few inches from their
noses.

“Macnell”: Captains of grounded
ships have blamed everything from
faulty compasses to submarine up-
heavals, but it was left to Capitaine
Pierre Lacaret, master of the liner
Liberte, ex-Europa, to cite a building as
the cause of his ship’s mud-berthing in
Le Havre harbor. He pleaded before
the Le Havre maritime court recently
that as a high building which used to
form a windbreak for the ship’s berth
had been destroyed during the war, the
Liberty was exposed to the full violence
of a storm, which piled her up on the
gale-capsized liner Paris. The court
accepted the plea and he was acquitted.
Liberte was refloated.

“Clooter”: Back in South Africa after
looking over the broadcasting field in
Australia, a Mrs. Enid Alexander, sent
here for the purpose by the S.A.P.M.G.,
opposed any idea of permitting commer-
cial radio in the Union. She said B-class
stations had “Americanised” Australia,
“This was left of my shower. You plumbers are frightfully forgetful! "
and paid a graceful tribute to A.B.C.
for its children’s programmes and the
way in which it had put music into us.
I’m with her on both, particularly
the children’s sessions, and I’m with her
when she adds, “I believe my dislike for
Australian commercial radio was because
of blood-and-thunder serials.” But the
lady is mistaken if she thinks the serials
are meant for the children or if she be-
lieves many children have any time for
them. Most of them run at times when
any properly-controlled child is at school
or abed, and if one had the eye of Argus
and could see into places where they are
listened to, he’d find the ears attuned to
them affixed to heads which, at least in
size and appearance, are adult. All the
same, it’s rather a pity the lady didn’t
hear the A.B.C. thriller broadcast from
Canberra and entitled “The Parliamentary
Session Debates on the Banking Bill.”
No commercial station had anything to
equal the thunder of it, at least, and it
had the further advantage of ranging all
the way from bitter hatred to pure farce.

“Pitt St.”: A woman arrived at Sydney
Hospital the other day under the belief
that she’d swallowed her false teeth,
seeking an X-ray to locate them. Her
husband, slightly doubtful about it, sent
his son home to have a final look around,
and the teeth were found on a dressing-
table, whereupon everybody went happily
about, their business. At that the lady
was luckier than a chap I knew years
ago. He took a nap on the kitchen sofa,
awoke to find his teeth missing, felt the
pain and pressure of a hard object in his
stomach, rushed to a doctor and was
immediately prepared for operation. But
he collapsed at the first whiff of chloro-
form, A month later his widow, selling
up the home before moving to distant
parts, was listing the furniture with the
auctioneer and discovered the teeth in a
cleft of the sofa-cushion.

“Jasby”: There’s a bloke who writes
a New York letter to London which is
syndicated in most Australian States.
Mostly I appreciate his efforts to keep- a
British end up in America, though in so
doing he is sometimes prone to kick
Uncle Sam a little too hard on too little
provocation. But he gave me a grin last
week with a glorious mixed metaphor.
Complaining of the Yanks’ habit of
hogging all the credit for the invention
of the atomic-bomb and overlooking the
contribution of British and Canadian —
he might have added Australian —
scientists, he said:
Maybe this is the time to remind our
friends that the eggs would never have
been hatched without our help, and if any
omelettes are being planned we should be
consulted.
Those Yanks are mighty clever guys, but
if they’re planning to make omelettes
out of hatched eggs, even egg-starved
Britain will be content to let them keep
’em all to themselves,

“Craiser”: Ted Shawn, the American
dancer, has been telling New York that
the harshness and austerity of Australian
life and the rugged, masculine character
of its inhabitants call less for ballet tradi-
tion than for the application of the prin-
ciples df the modern American dance.
What harshness and austerity? What
rugged masculinity? And who said
American dance principles weren’t being
applied in this country? I write within
earshot of the Melbourne Town Hall,
where hundreds of rugged, austere Aus-
tralians clinched together are gyrating
slowly with a look of complete vacuity
on their faces to the tune of boogie-
woogie. Mr. Shawn evidently meant to
refer to the pukka ballet. He thinks we
ought to follow the abo, whose cor-
roborees tremendously impressed him.
Well, we have been doing it in the realm
of painting, and the cult of primitivism
has produced a queer-looking lot of pic-
tures, Mr. Shawn is merely repeating
the modern notion that what is needed
is new forms, whereas it is what is put
into the forms that is important. Sally
Gilmour, the perky little ballerina of the
Ballet Rambert, dances the old traditional
ballets and makes them live. Another
ballerina can make them look as dead as
frozen mutton.

“D.C.”: Lawyers’ bills (B. 5/11/ ’47)?
My boss had a client whose office was
directly opposite ours. One morning we
were held up over a minor point, and
I was sent over to make; inquiries.
Knocking soon proved no one was in,
and I reported the fact. A month later
when preparing a detailed statement I
actually had to type “Attending Mr. So-
and-So, and he not in, 6s, Bd.”

“Smouge”: As a commando Happy
knew a lot about explosives and lethal
weapons in general, but his knowledge
was not shared by all, and when he tossed
a Mills bomb, minus pin, under a bunk
the mob scattered. The bomb had been
deloused. He caused another stir when,
with a revolver, he shot out the lights
in the barrack-room one night. Then he
gave an unwanted demonstration of
knife-throwing during which several
nearly lost their ears. But the end came
one night when he held aloft a handful
of dynamite with fuse sputtering. When
the fuse had burned itself down to the
charge there was a shattering roar. Happy
picked himself up from the floor and
dashed for cover. He*still doesn’t know
who dropped the fourpenny hunger be-
hind him.

“Steien”: Let me aud to “Butch’s”

people desirous of a new title or name.
In former times a busdriver was called a
busdriver. An advt. in the Launceston
“Examiner” announcing vacancies for
drivers of tourist buses calls them coach-
captains ! I am looking forward to
meeting a taxi-commander or a tramway-
commodore.

“Penelope’s Mate”: On our dreary way
to work one morning, just as the too-early
burning sun was coming over the Haisho
horizon, a distant sound of rifle-fire set
our suddenly-hopeful hearts beating faster.
Snarling guards herded us into a culvert,
and we sat scared and wondering. In-
side 10 minutes up from the paddy-fields,
filthy and bedraggled, came a motley
horde of Jap civilians armed with sticks.
They rushed the road near us, hurled
themselves into an open drain, vaguely
pointed their weapons at the far-away
mountains, and yelled “Bang-bang-bang! ”
Behind them an immaculately-attired Jap
officer on horseback shouted an order,
and five sweat-drenched and mud-
spattered Jap soldiers lay down and
fired their rifles over the shaven skulls of
Haisho’s Home Guard, Another order,
and the comic army staggered upright;
then, screaming defiance at the deserted
countryside, it “fought” onwards. Paddy
dodged a boot from the guard who urged
our moving. “Who wouldn’t be a
prisoner?” he remarked., “That’s exactly
what the poor blankards are doing back
home now.”

“Xenexer”: N.S.W. School Supplies
Department is having difficulty in obtain-
ing packing-cases and paste-bottles, and
there is a possibility of supplies to schools
being short or delayed. This is overcome
by having empty boxes and bottles re-
turned. At least that is the instruction
to heads of schools. Today I took some
to the railway station and was informed
that the only empties that may be re-
turned on the railways are beer-cases and
beer-bottles.

“Bramley”: We were enjoying “Opera-
tion Cook’s Tour” around the shambles
and horror that was Berlin. Arrived at
the Russian zone, we were halted by a
Soviet soldier whose fur cap, jacket
and beard gave him a wild appearaftce.
Ivan pulled up the sleeve of his jacket,
displaying a row of wristlet watches from
his elbow to wrist, at the same time mak-
ing signs that he wished to exchange our
cheap watches for the German time-
pieces. Our crowd agreed eagerly, and
when the deal was completed our guide
said, “Ivan thinks he put one over you
because your watches were going and his
weren’t; those blokes don’t know that
tickers need winding.”

“Plop” nearly enlists:
With a rain of shell-fragments on eastern
Sydney suburbs, the campaign for recruiting
Army Regulars was off to a grand start, so I
went along to see what the exhibition in Martin-
place had to offer. Things had changed. Was
that a Lion and Unicorn on the sleeve of a
jovial old chap who patiently explained the
workings of a Bren to a business-girl for the
retort: “Wonderful, just wonderful. But what
is it used for?” Then there was a
phenomenon closely resembling the old field-
cooker —steam swishing through the pipes, pots
bubbling over. No, it couldn’t be. Those white-
capped, -coated, -trousered chaps manning it
didn’t look like Army cooks, nor did the plate
of scrumptious cakes which they passed out
to the crowd look or taste like Army fodder.
But, s’welp me, blokes, it said on the poster
“Field Kitchen.” Close by was a monstrous
'excavator, the Army’s latest in digging-gear.
Not a trace of the old days in the whole
darned show —an R.S.M. who could look a
person in the eye and not swear, cooks who
worked without dirty singlets or soot
from ear to ear and, to cap it all, a mechanical
dirt-shifter. Then beside this steehtoothed
monster I spied a heap of sand. In it, up to
their hocks, were two Diggers swinging “banjos”
in the finest style of the A.I.F.

“Hep-2-3-4”: When asked what he
considered to be the most amazing thing
about the human body, a very wise
doctor is said to have chosen “The swell-
ing of the head after a patting of
the back.” Noticeably true in the Army,
this phenomenon was even more appar-
ent among the pint-sized troops ofi Aus-
tralia’s Senior Cadet Corps. One
youngster had entered a yearly holiday-
camp at Wallgrove. He wound up his
official fortnight’s stay as an orderly in
the staff-officers’ mess, liked the job, and
pleaded to be allowed to remain there
until the end of his holidays. Permission
granted, his toiling culminated in a formal
mess held on the last day of the camp
and attended by a Lieutenant-General.
Primed as to the lad’s keenness,
the General called him in, produced a
stripe from somewhere and pinned it
on his arm. After acknowledging the
honor with a snappy heel-click, the cadet
turned about and went back to his fellows
in the cookhouse. Not two minutes
elapsed before his, voice roared in—•
“Clean them dixies, or I’ll have you peel-
ing spuds.”
ACROSS THE MIDDIES AND THE
TOTS.
. “Addressing the A.L.P. Federal executive, Mr.
Chifley exhorted his hearers to go out and ‘fight
tor banking nationalisation on the platform, at
the street-corners and even in the bars.’ ”
It wakens in my memory
A certain Tennysonian line
About a pleasant colloquy
“Across the walnuts and the wine.”
A setting Mr. Chifley tries,
You will observe, to modernise.
He bids his henchmen sally forth
At trading banks to scoff and rail
In haunts where schooners foam and froth
With thirst-allaying nut-brown ale,
And beaming Bonifaces ply
Their trade with assiduity.
For lalk across the nuts and port
As out-of-date, he’d substitute
The bellow and the scornful snort
Accompanying hot dispute
Apt to occur when fellows mix
Their malt and hops with politics.
The prospect gives a bloke the pip.
Ev’n now at eve, when bar-rooms fill,
, It’s quite a job to score a nip
And one may find it harder still
With agitators on his flanks
Hurling abuse at private banks.
Will factious brays assail our lugs
And hints at plutocratic plots
Between the bottles and the jugs,
Across the middies and the tots,
And serve to drown the brisk refrain
Of “Fill ’em up” and “Same again”?
You’ve surely buttoners, Ben, enough
To boost the faith that you maintain,
Mob orators to do their stuff
On Yarra Bank and the Domain
And prove their worth at thumping tubs.
But spare us from such pests in pubs!

“Bo”: On the crowded, brightly-sunlit
footpath outside a city pub the eagle-
eyed street photographer held up a couple
walking aimlessly along. The wife she
must have been his wife by the way she
took charge of things—stopped dead, dis-
played a toothy grin and ordered her
hapless escort to comb his hair. Fur-
tively he dragged a few inches of comb
from his coat, made a swift pass or two
at his unruly thatch and adopted the
usual look of embarrassed fatuity com-
mon to men getting their photos taken.
But his agony was not to be soon relieved.
The photographer was fussy. Two atti-
tudes weren’t quite right. But just as he
had taken them to his satisfaction a couple
of passers-by inserted their forms be-
tween the lens-wielder and his victims. By
this time the inevitable goggle-eyed
gawpers were doing overtime at their
favorite work. The photographer
beckoned his subjects a pace forward.
The woman obeyed ; the man took one
pace backward and two to the left and
vanished through the saloon-bar door. If
the photographer had thought to snap
the expression on the frustrated wife’s
face when she looked around he’d have
had a prizewinner.

“North”: Tourists to Wilpena Pound
(S.A.) pass one sight not listed in the
advertisements. It is a homestead right
by the road, one half painted green and
white, the other brown. It wasn’t the
paint shortage, either; it’s been like that
for years. Two brothers living under the
one roof couldn’t agree as to color-
scheme.

“C.Q.”: The world’s most persistent
punter has been discovered in Melbourne.
He is a gentleman popularly known as
“S'long, Mary, and good luck.”
“New Zealand” who made a sudden
appearance on Victorian courses and dis-
played an almost uncanny ability to pick
winners. In a short time he had reversed
the local saying that one has only to put
a bag round one’s neck in Melbourne for
fools to come and put money in it. At
the peak of his fortunes he received an
unexpected visit from the police while he
was in the midst of important financial
operations at his customary place or
business. He was conveyed to the city
watch-house and charged with failure to
pay maintenance to his wife, who had
apparently heard of his achievements. As
he had thousands of notes on his person
he was out on bail within 10 minutes. A
fast taxi took him back to the course,
where it is alleged he placed £lOOO on
Columnist and scored another triumph,

“Macnell” on a pilgrimage:
Reported in connection with the Tobruk
delegation’s projected pilgrimage to Gallipoli
that the last Anzac Service on Gallipoli was
held by S. M. Bruce in 1924. In April,
1935, men from cruisers Australia and Sydney
trekked the four miles across the peninsula and
attended a service at Lone Pine cemetery held
by Australia’s chaplain. It was a glorious
Mediterranean noon, and the hills above tne
Beach were carpeted in green grass necked
with white flowers. Under the white plinth
memorial we bared our heads, and as the
chaplain mentioned names —Lone Pine, Shrapnel
Gully, Quinn’s Post —a ghostly company ot
unforgotten men seemed to move among us.
Afterwards we walked around. The cemeteries
were beautifully kept, white headstones reaching
in ordered array over vividly green lawns to me
white memorial at each cemetery s head.
Shrapnel Gully nestled quietly in its amphi-
theatre of hills, and, seen from above, made a
pretty contrast of white stones amongst the
shrubbery green. Over the. hills old paths
stooped in forky zig-zags, and at unexpected
corners crumbling earthworks of some post
bore mute witness to the violence those hills
had seen. The beach itself, with the silken
rustle of the tideless sea flashing little scallops
of white lace amongst the amber of it, was
still studded with rusting hulls, and scattered
with rust-eaten bully and condensed-milk tins.
At 4 p m. the white and blue uniforms walked
wonderingly back across the strip their fathers
had died for, and as soon as boats were hoisted
both ships put to sea. The Old Man timed
his breasting of Anzac Cove for sunset. As
the sun dipped towards the line of hills all
hands came on deck to watch. The bugler
stood, silhouetted on the edge of the bridge.
The sun touched; and across to that pregnant
earth thrilled the low, slow notes of the Last
Post Then we altered course. But though tne
Australian ships had left, there remained those
who have made/Gallipoli for ever a part ot their
own Australia.!

“Spokeshave”: The Guy Fawkes tradi-
tion (B. 19/11/’47) is certainly as dead as
Caesar’s cat in Victoria. The fire brigade
was called out to a tremendous blaze in
my district on November 5. What was
the firemen’s' disgust when they found
that it was an immense pile of rubbish
which had been lit by two elderly
spinsters apparently seized with the be-
lief that if the ceremony were neglected
the Empire would fall to pieces. They
were solemnly dancing round the con-
flagration like the witches in “Macbeth”
and there wasn’t a youngster present.

“Yair”; What annoys me most in film
advts. is the way housewives smile into
the frying-pan. The shot shows them
alone in the kitchen, and the commentator
describes, say, the onions in the pan. But
why does the actress always show all her
teeth as she attends to the onions? I’ve
yet to walk in unexpectedly to a kitchen
and see the same broad grin on any real-
life housewife as she struggles through
the cooking.
* * * *
“Nakhoda”: Some doubt has arisen
as to whether the 14 “Malays” who are
to be expelled from Australia will be
granted permission to land in Singapore.
The authorities in that seaport say that
it will be necessary for Mr. Calwell to
prove that the expelled men were born
in Malaya. The cradle of the race is
traditionally placed in Menangkabau,
Sumatra, and it starts with an Adam-and-
Eve story in which rice takes the place
of the apple. By Allah’s mercy the first
couple were able to make the soil pro-
duce the golden grain and the race multi-
plied and spread until it covered the
Whole of the archipelago. “Malay” is
applied loosely to any Indonesian seaman,
though the East Indian islands have more
mixtures than Europe. They range from
Aryan Indians, who arrived with the
Hindu conquest of Java, to negritos and
tree-dwellers, who are closely allied to
the Australian abo. Whatever the race
was which migrated down through India
and across the bridge which in prehistoric
times made Australia part of Asia, it left
“Take an encore and we'll have scrambled eggs for supper!"
colonies of primitives on mountain-tops
and islands right through the archipelago.

“Kendon”: The Bulletin rarely
nods, but two irreconcilable statements
appeared in a recent issue. Beneath
Heth’s caption of “The Leaning Tower
of P.S.A.” (B. 5/11/ ’47) is the in-
formation that 567,000 are drawing pay
from Commonwealth, State and local
government. This refutes “Pindorra’s
remark, same issue, that “like the pioneer,
the goats are disappearing into the sun-
set,”

“Emel”: Car-registration numbers (B.
29/10/,’47)?. Neatest I’ve seen was that

“Pontius Penwiper”: Revision of a
sectional handbook which is to be repub-
lished after a lapse of ten years gave me
a grim reminder of how swiftly the
waters of oblivion do their job. A “Per-
sonalities” section in the old volume
contained 230 names: only 32 of these
will remain in the new list, mostly cut
down to the barest details. My own blue
pencil faltered on the excision work, but
a special sub-committee was brutal.
Something of a personal feeling caused
me to make a fight for a predecessor in
my own activity, once regarded a cham-
pion in his line. “Who was he, anyway?”
demanded one of the newcomers ; a mere
line to say he once existed was all I
could save for him. Next time a vote of
thanks for my activity is carried by en-
thusiastic acclamation my thought will
be lacerated by that incident. The “out-
standing services” of this year of grace
may be merely the subject of a sneer
in 1957.

“McGlum”: A day in the city at the
mercy of a Repat. board is bad enough,
but a 70-mile journey home with a gar-
rulous female violating the quiet sanc-
tuary of a smoker piles on the misery a
bit too thick. The gabbler I struck was
a saleswoman for hearing-aids, and she
seemed to think us -all deaf and shy about
speaking. Unsuccessfully I tried to read.
The other fellows listened politely, mak-
ing expressive gestures of helplessness
when the chatterbox wasn’t looking. All
except a young man in the corner opposite
the nuisance. He read steadily and
seemed oblivious to the barrage while I
became amazed at his concentrative
powers. When the windbag got out I
asked: “How did you manage to read
with that noise in your ears?” He
grinned, lifted back his coat, and pointed
to the ear furthest from me. “The, best
thing about these gadgets,” he said, “is
that you can switch ’em off at any time.”

“Ess”: After displaying his wares and
talking a while, he lowers his voice a
little and says confidentially: “The
lady next door bought one of these.
They are priced at 2s. 6d.; but,
look, I’ll let you have it at 25.”
Maybe it is the acquisitive desire to
secure a bargain; maybe it appeals to
vanity to know that you are making a
purchase on better terms than your neigh-
bor. Whatever it is, this hawker with a
knowledge of psychology claims that it
works eight times out of ten,
* * * *
“Torch”; That baffled Prussian psy-
chology of the unteroffizier (B. 15 /10/’47)
recalls the chastening of a R.S.M. in
World War I. As new recruits from Fiji
we were attached to the King’s Royal
Rifle Corps, and training began under his
baleful glare. In a matter of days most
of the troops were unanimously of the
opinion that Sarn’-major Nobby was the
world’s worst blankard. One of his
pleasantries was to march every draft
for France to the station, and as the train
was pulling out he would drown all per-
sonal threats and insults by loudly re-
minding the troops that he, would be
waiting to lick them into shape again
after their discharge from hospital, if
lucky enough to be wounded. A later
reinforcement was leaving, to the usual
, accompaniment of threats and profanity,
when one of them facetiously called for
“Three cheers for Nobby.” The troops
saw the joke and responded manfully.
From that day the R.S.M. was a changed
man. When some of us returned to the
camp from hospital expecting a rough
spin we found ourselves treated as
humans by an efficient but kindly old
man: Evidently the old boy believed the
cheers had been meant.

“Ell”: Our subbub has become accus-
tomed to late, erratic and very occasional
trains. Recently it suffered an alteration
to its evening timetable. The useful 7.22,
which reached the city conveniently close
to 8 p.m., was replaced by an outlandish
7.8 affair. Once in operation, however,
the change proved to be not quite as in-
convenient as it appeared, the 7.8 being
always from 10 to 15 minutes late, which
neatly restored the status quo. The degree
of lateness could be easily calculated with
a slide-rule and a table of logarithms
from the amount by which the previous
6.47 (nominal) was in arrears, thus en-
abling the 10-minute walk to the station
to be timed to a nicety. Last night we
calculated it as 12 minutes late, and had
to sprint the last 100 yards. I stumbled
off the station steps just as the guard was
reaching for his starting-bell, and, indi-
cating Mrs. Ell valiantly tripping down
after me, I panted “Hold it a second.”
With an air of outraged propriety he
answered: “Dash it, we’re six minutes
late already!”

“R.W.”: Reference to Bishop Sexton,
of British Columbia, recalls that the chief
church of his diocese, most
western cathedral, records in its “Robin
Column” an incident associated with the
building of the nave. In the spring of
1927, when the scaffolding was about the
height of the great capitals of the
columns, a pair of robins chose this spot
to build their nest, laid their eggs and
reared their young, undeterred by the
noise and movements of the workmen.
The complete trust of the birds evoked
the suggestion that it would accord well
with ancient church-building practices to
perpetuate in stone that the robins had
found sanctuary in the cathedral. The
•bird and its nest were carved in stone
above the capital of the column, known
thereafter as the “Robin Column.”

“Nick”: Unlike “Baldy’s” (B.
19/11/ *47), my barber’s humor runs to
the worst type of practical-jokery. Vari-
ous props litter his shelves; horrible
spring-legged spiders hang down from
the ceiling ; a plastic carpet-snake nests
among the magazines ready to terrify
any stranger who wants to spend his wait-
ing-time in a little quiet reading. The
shearer’s masterpiece, until recently, was
a trick glass of beer made of solid amber
jelly in a schooner topped with a very
realistic collar. He used to proclaim that
he felt dry, pick up this item from the
counter and invert it over his victim,
who would oblige with a startled yelp
and leap for cover. Then the hot weather
hit town, found its way into the glass,
and indirectly proved that bit about the
last laugher bursting his braces.
Humbled, the barber duly coughed up
sufficient for cleaning and pressing opera-
tions of the jelly-smeared suit whose nark
owner “had no sense of humor.”
GO WEST.
“At a reception to newly-arrived immigrants,
N.S.W. Governor Northcott advised them to get out
of the overcrowded city and settle in country towns.
Go West, y,ou immigrants, or set your faces
To East or North— depends on where you
Where J you will come on less congested spaces
Than any that are waiting close at hand.
For blithe newcomers there are better places
Than crowded cities, you must understand,
At whatsoever craft you toil and spin
To live and move and have your being m.
“Go West, young man!” Some Yankee states-
man said it,
Whose name I’ve momentarily forgot,
Although it’s often quoted to his credit.
And it’s as applicable, is it not,
To here as anywhere? From AtoZ it
Covers the situation, hits the spot,
That adjuration, pithily expressed
To questioners: “Go West, young man, go
West!”
Get out from where humanity so dense is
In smoky cities stacked with snares and sins,
To haunts where Nature kindlier gifts dispenses
To those with hardy hands and husky chins,
To where the fuller, finer life commences,
The genuine Australia begins
(As poets sing), where gums and wattles bloom
And no one snarls at lack of elbow-room.
Go West, you chaps who’ve journeyed hither
seeking
New lands where Fortune waves her magic
wand. ~ , ...
Leave roar of trams and factory-whistles shriek-
ing , , ,
And take a ticket for what lies beyond.
You’ll never hear a bit of sounder speaking,
I wonder, though, how many will respond
And steel their hearts to carve a home and wrest
A living from the wide and spacious West.

THE SERVICE MAN
Blamey on Sandakan.
“Ek Dum”: That the lives of the 1800
men of the Sandakan death march (May,
1945) might have been saved if air-
craft had been available to carry out a
plan to drop parachute troops into San-
dakan in February, 1945, is the grave
statement attributed to General Blarney
in Melbourne. It makes more urgent the
inquiry which has been demanded in
these pages again and again.
The former C.-in-C. was reported to
have said at the Federal Conference of
the Armored Corps Association:
We had high hopes of being able to use
Australian parachute troops. We had
complete plans for them. Our spies were
in Japanese-held territory. We had estab-
lished the necessary contacts with prisoners
at Sandakan, and our parachute troops
were going in to relieve them. The para-
chute regiment didn’t know what was
planned, of course. But at the moment
we wanted to act we couldn’t get the
necessary aircraft to take them in. The
operation would certainly have saved that
death march of Sandakan. Destiny didn’t
permit us to carry it out.
The whole position is a scandal and
always has been a scandal. The Gov-
ernment was perfectly aware from the
time of the escape of the party of Major
Steele in June, 1943, that Sandakan was
lightly held—so lightly held that even at
that juncture a large force of Philippine
guerrillas existed within boat-reach in the
Sulu Islands. It actually transferred to
Sandakan camp some arms and ammuni-
tion which were buried against the
moment when an insurrection or a rescue
would take place.
The iron grip which the Japanese exer-
cised on the natives and the severity with
which they treated any contact between
them and the prisoners-of-war showed
how fearful they were of the position.
When the question was raised in the
House last week by, Mr. Falkinder, Mr.
Chifley said he had not seen General
Blarney’s statement and he could remem-
ber nothing of the plan. He fell back on
the Government’s old whine that the
conduct of the Pacific campaign was
under the command of General Mac-
Arthur, who would have had to approve
the operation.
If Mr. Chifley does not remember any
discussion of plans for the rescue of the
unfortunates of Borneo he is not fit to
be Prime Minister. The matter was
raised more than once—it was raised very
specifically and vigorously in the War
Advisory Council by Dr. Page and
treated, as usual, with contempt, since
the Government was perfectly prepared
to let the war go its own gait with the
responsibility on General MacArthur’s
shoulders.
“A Desirable Operation,”
When the matter was raised the Gov-
ernment must have had knowledge of
where the troops were and of the weak-
ness, even debility, of the Japanese forces
at Sandakan. There is little doubt that if
a special request had been made to
General MacArthur or to the United
States Government something would
have been done, but Federal “Labor” at
the time was too much engaged in trying
to establish that it would have totali-
tarian powers after the war to worry
about a few p.-0.-w. And the matter was
treated in the spirit which allowed Mr.
Chifley to say last week that he could
“well imagine that circumstances might
have arisen in which a shortage of air-
craft could have prevented a desirable
operation, because for some time equip-
ment was very short, although with the
great help of the Americans it had been
streagthened and a very formidable Air
Force created in the South-west Pacific
area.”
“Desirable operation”! In the retro-
spect, what an expression for the rescue
of 2000 Australian and British lads, whom
the Government of this country knew
specifically and beyond doubt to be living
in conditions of unimaginable squalor and
torture on the very fringes of the sea, in a
situation which was known to be bomb-
able without resistance and the means of
ingress to which were perfectly familiar
to men who had actually been in and out
of the place.
The gravest issues are raised by Sir
Thomas Blarney’s statement.
Had the Government insisted in 1944
on action, somebody would have acted.
Buf its responsibility was even graver in
1945.
Then “Labor” allowed Australian
troops, with superb equipment, to be
used in the Tarakan and Balikpapan land-
ings, though those centres as vital oil
areas could be taken for granted as be-
ing as strongly defended as any likely to
be found in the East Indies and much
more strongly defended than Sandakan.
Why was the Labuan-Miri opera-
tion agreed to, to take over areas in which
there were not enough Japs to fill a
bucket, when to get there Sandakan with
its suffering thousands had to be passed
almost in sight by a force of Australian
troops which coul'd have taken it in 10
minutes, and swept on and saved at least
a substantial proportion of the dying re-
mains of the A.LF.?
The Blain Case
The Government’s war record is con-
sistent with the manner in which it has
supported one of those among its
members who have been yelping furtively
in the House for some little time that
A. M. Blain, a Digger of two wars,
mained—yes, maimed, and seriously, by
Jap torture —had shown his gold pass to
the Japs to gain special treatment.
The Prime Minister knows and the
Army Minister knows what the facts are.
They know that there is not a sliver of
fact in the monstrous slander, yet they
shield the slanderer.
The State president of the Victorian
R.S.L. has demanded an inquiry into
General Blarney’s statement.
He declared that what had been said
would evoke in the mind of every wife
and mother the thought that her boy
might have returned had somebody on
the home front not failed to match the
spirit of the men on service.
The fault (he said) was not in the
men of the forces, for it was a charac-
teristic quality of Australian servicemen
that they would dare anything to rescue
a comrade in distress. The people would
want to know who was responsible for
the military command not having the
means to rescue their comrades.
On the Brink of War?
“Ek Dum”: The position in Europe
has never been so serious since 1939.
The Communist bloc has virtually de-
clared war on the West and Western
methods. The continued abuse of Presi-
dent Truman and Western statesmen
(“warmongers”) by the bloody-handed
Vyshinsky has not been without purpose.
It has been the battle-cry of Moscow
preparatory to some as yet unspecified
action.
Whenever there is Soviet propaganda
there is action of some sort in the back-
ground.
Vyshinsky’s speech in New York last
week when he was entertained by a Soviet
Friendship League was quite obviously
aimed at Western Europe. Linked with
the French raid on the Beauregard refugee
camp, which had become a sort of
Russian kidnapping depot on French
soil, nothing could have better pointed
the desperate condition of affairs in
Western Europe. The Communists had
just then been severely defeated in
France at the municipal elections, and
Vyshinsky made an attack on Messrs.
Churchill and Byrnes, with an especially
vicious assault on General de Gaulle.
The situation was more delicate in
that France was in the throes of chaos,
caused by the attempts of the defeated
Communist minority to take over.
The hardening of the attitude of the
Western Powers on the eve of the Foreign
Ministers’ conference was unmistakable.
Attlee and Marshall
First came Mn Attlee’s speech depre-
cating Soviet insults, all the more signifi-
cant for having been made at the Lord
Mayor’s banquet.
Next followed the strong speech of Mr.
Marshall, who charged the Soviet dele-
gates to U.N.O. with “propaganda of
the most brazen and contemptuous
character,” adding sternly:
Since it affects the very stability of the
world it is time to call a halt to such
inflammatory practices Soviet officials

Racing greyhounds reach their
prime when they’re 30 months
old and usually remain at their
peak for 3 seasons. Occasionally
a good dog will compete with
equal success as a flat racer, and
in the field, and finish his career
as a useful hurdler. Most famous
Australian dog of all time was
“Terminus” which was whelped
in 1923 and won the Australian
and N.S.W. Waterloo Cups in
1925, the Victorian Waterloo
Cup in 1926 and the N.S.W.
Waterloo Cup in 1927. The most
famous “aged” dog is “Mick the
Monk”, who won hurdle races in
1940 and, as a 9 year old today,
is still racing.
A Whisky enters its prime at the
age of five years. In its first five
years, a steady progression of
changes brings it from the raw-
ness of immaturity to the mellow-
ness of fine bouquet and smooth-
ness on the tongue. Corio Special
is a fine whisky and is not mar-
keted until over five years old
(more than double the minimum
prescribed by Commonwealth
law).
lIP
&
w
and Communist groups in many countries
are waging with increasing venom a calcu-
lated campaign of vilification and distortion
of American motives in foreign affairs;...
The Secretary of State declared that
the U.S.A. had not used the greatest
military power and resources ever
assembled to acquire a privileged posi-
tion, either political or economic :
From the termination of hostilities to the
present the Soviet Government has con-
sistently followed a course which is bound
to arouse the resentment of our people.
... .The American people have been very
patient, but they have been virtually driven
into active resentment.
“Preparing for War”
Mr. Everett Dirksen, a Republican
back from Europe the same day,
said that “the Soviet” was “feverishly
preparing for war.”
And that the United States does not
altogether differ from that view is shown
by its actions;
(a) A large number of de-militarised
squadrons of heavy bombers have been put
brack on the active list and reconditioned.
(b) For the first time } the U.S.A. has
joined openly in the training of Chinese
troops to fight Chinese Communists.
(c) The Greek Army is being strengthened
by the adhesion of U.S. officers.
(d) The American pipeline from the
Persian region to the Mediterranean is
being pushed ahead.
On the Russian side all the preparations
suggest war, and early war at that.
Russian troops undoubtedly have been
mobilising both on the Thracian and
Ardahan borders, and the Turks are still
in a state of partial mobilisation, while
Russian threats to Persia have been re-
newed.
Communists from all over the world
are drifting in droves towards Moscow
and strategic sections of the Balkans no\y
reorganised under Communist control.
The Position in France
The municipal elections in France, like
elections all over the globe, having
proved that the game is up for Com-
munism, the beast there is showing his
claws, a fact of which Vyshinsky s speech
was symptomatic.
Strikes of Communist type have begun
to develop with the specific objective of
paralysing transport by sea and land,
fuel-using industries and defence.
By a strange coincidence Thorez,
leader of the French Communists—
though some people have been at great
pains recently to prove that he is not
leader at all —is in Moscow, just as the
secretary of the South African Com-
munist party was in Moscow in 1922,
sitting on the staff which directed the
Rand insurrection.
By the week-end there were 750,000
Communist-led strikers in France; M.
Ramadier had resigned the Premiership
and M. Leon Blum, 76, failing to secure
sufficient votes to succeed him, gave way
to M. Schuman, Finance Minister in the
Ramadier Cabinet and a member of the
Catholic Progressive party. Paris was
full of soldiery, and when this was
written France was on the verge of a
Communist-made civil war, only avertible
by strong leadership, which seemed un-
attainable.
Australia’s Toy Scheme
The only countries which appear to
be taking much for granted regarding
Russia are Socialist Britain and Socialist
Australia. Let General Blarney express
the sensible view about the effort of the
Chifley Government, whose complacent
Army Minister believes war cannot hap-
pen for 15 years:
The Australian Government goes ahead
with a toy scheme. There are some armored
troops and along with them some trainees.
In a few years the trainees won’tbe there.
There 17 no doubt about that. The whole
approach to the defence problem is un-
Tapani General Blarney said would
not be a potential menace to Australia
in this generation or the next.
“But,” he added, “the position is dif-
ferent with Russia, whose traditional in-
stinct for open water is still a factor m
the field of strategy. The Russian drive
is operating not only in Asia but also
in Europe. All the trouble in Greece is
because of the quiet infiltration of people
from neighboring countries now practi-
cally dominated by Russia.”
But, even on the possible brink of war,
the Chifley Government does not dare
to put its defences in order. The wharfies
and the ironworkers wouldn’t like it.
Vale Tom Griffiths!
On September 2, 1914, a Sunday m°rmng,
the then Prime Minister summoned to his house
six civil and military officers of the Common-
wealth Defence Department to discuss a cable
which had been received from the British Gov-
ernment advising him to take instant step
to defend Australian ports.
This was the first real war conference of
World War I held in Australia. The last ot
those who took part has died in Toorak (yic.),
the well-beloved, energetic, fearless l° m
Griffiths, a superlative organiser who was bom
a little too early to achieve the greatness which
should have been his.
A Welshman born at Presteigne, Radnorshire,
Sent. 29, 1865, he had come to Australia in
his youth. In 1886, a public servant, he
joined the Victorian Permanent Military Forces.
He suffered from the stagnation which afflicted
all military officers in succeeding years. When
World War I broke out he had been trans-
ferred to the Commonwealth Forces and ranked
as a captain holding the office of Military
Secretary. Doing the same work today his
rank and office would have been far better
recompensed. He was then 49.
General Bridges appreciated Griffiths s
organising ability and picked .him as ms
administrative officer. Tom Griffiths s picture
in a familiar pose is to be seen—square-jawed,
master of himself—in the back row of the
group of the Staff of the First Division, AJ.F.,
at Mena, Egypt, in December 1914 Wha
a set of officers they were —Budges, Brudenell
White, Blarney, Neville Howse, V.C., R.
Casey, poor Foster, Cecil Foott, the monu-
mental Glasfurd, Eric Plant! _ ,
The only thing unusual about that Mena
photograph is that Griffiths was in the rear •
rank. Usually he was well in front, the centre
of every picture where work was to be done,
toiling, organising, smoothing out difficulties,
the right hand of the command.
His friends remembered him well on those
first nights at Anzac, frequenting the Beach
at all hours, sorting out the reinforcements,
sending them to their right positions, super-
vising this, adjusting that, always laboring and
never fussed or flurried more than a Welsh
temperament dictated, despite the fact that he
was in the most exposed position on the
Peninsula, sometimes with fragments flying like
ra In France it was the same. What he had been
to Bridges, now dead, he became to Bird-
wood as A.A.G. Age and experience gave
him a certain balance denied to younger and
fresher men. In the end so much fell upon
his shoulders and he was so indispensable in
sickness and in health that he showed signs
of breaking down, but he refused to leave
until Birdwood decided that he must have
a buffer of strength and reliability between him-
self and the' Government. So he sent Griffiths,
unwilling and resistant, to take over the great
Australian H.Q. at Horseferry-road, which at
once assumed a new usefulness and a new
significance. . . ..
It became, as it were, an integral part or
the battle-line, a machine for stoking into the
sadly suffering and depleted ranks of the A.1.F.,
always short' of reinforcements, as much man-
power as could be scraped up. Horseferry-
road in Griffiths’s day was no place for able-
bodied men—“ Tom’s Harem” was its whispered
nickname, since it was rapidly staffed from
top to bottom by women in every position
from which a man could be released and m
which a girl could serve. Griffiths made ot
his assignment something that probably no
other man in the A.I.F. or perhaps in any
other British force could have made, and bis
liaison with the battle command was, as usual
in all his work, smooth and as nearly perfect
as might be. . , . . . ,
Like most other men in his position, be
returned to an indefinite military world in
which there was no real place for him. He
had gone away a captain; he came back a
temporary Brigadier, but his military career
virtually finished. . , „ . . .
The Government found a job for him at
once —military Administrator for New Guinea
during its transition from war to peace. There
he set standards which no successor was ever
able to surpass. In 1921 he went to administer
Nauru, remaining till 1927, when he left,
respected and beloved by all. In 1932-33 ne
went back to New Guinea and stayed there
for three years as acting-Administrator and
Administrator. .... „ .
As the officer responsible during the A.l.b.s
birth throes for detail administration, promotion
and appointments, Griffith's as much as any
man could claim to be a maker of that peerless
force. He was 83 when he died last week.
Had he been 20‘ years younger there is no
doubt but that Australia would have looked
back on him as one of its military greatest;
also, as a man who embodied in himself every
military virtue, not the least of which was an
abiding modesty, .which never allowed him to
lose his balance or to deprecate the importance
of other and lesser men’s performances.

New Primate of Australia is Howard
West Kilvinton Mowll, Archbishop of
Sydney since 1933, when he succeeded
Archbishop Wright. He’s an Englishman
who went to Canada shortly after his
ordination and worked as tutor and later
professor at Wycliffe College, Toronto.
After a couple of years as chaplain in
World War I, he returned to Wycliffe as
Dean of the college, was chosen as
Assistant Bishop of Western China in
1922 and became Bishop four years later.
Since the death of Archbishop Le Fanu
last year he has been acting Primate, and
the decision of the Australian Bishops
to confirm him in the Primacy was an-
nounced on Sunday.
Victorian ex-servicemen have every
reason to be pleased at the result of their
State elections; all but two of the new
Lib.-C.P. members have served with the
armed forces. This new blood added to
the fair sprinkling of ex-Diggers already
on their side of the House should give
Victoria a higher proportion of members
with firsthand understanding of service-
men and their problems than any other
Parliament in Australia. Most of the
newcomers are veterans of the recent
war, but Lieut.-Colonel W. W. Leggatt
(Mornington) was a Digger of World
War I when he joined up for the second
scrap, in which he fought in Rabaul and
was commander of Sparrow Force in
Timor. Captured there, he spent three
years as a Nip prisoner in Malaya and
Thailand. He’s a son of a former moder-
ator of the Presbyterian church in Vic-
toria and was born in the New Hebrides
when his father was a missionary there.
There was a touch of the traditional
attitude of the skipper towards his sinking
ship in the conduct of Kenneth Ballan-
tyne, director and manager of the Christ-
church store which was burnt out last
week with the loss of 41' lives. Trapped
on the third floor of the burning building,
he was seen to make his way from, a
window through the flames in an attempt
to rescue two girls. Unsuccessful in
this, he reached a ledge and clung to it,
his clothes ablaze. Firemen played hoses
on him until others brought a ladder and
rescued him, semi-conscious and badly
burnt. Ballantyne was the last person
rescued from the fire, the worst in New
Zealand’s history.
Astronomers are a long-lived tribe.
Halley died at 86, the first Herschel at 84
and his son at 79. In Australia Charles
Todd, who, in addition to building the
Overland Telegraph, was Government
Astronomer in S.A. for 51 years, died in
1910 at 84, and early this month his
protege, William Ernest Cooke, passed
into the silence at the same age. Cooke
joined the Adelaide Observatory staff in
1878, and was first assistant to Todd
from 1883 to 1896, when he went to
Perth as W.A. Government Astronomer.
He stayed in the West until 1912, when
he took on the joint jobs of Government
Astronomer of N.S.W. and Professor of
Astronomy at Sydney Uni. For the past
20 years he had been living in retire-
ment in Adelaide. Many of his inven-
tions have become standard equipment in
observatories throughout the world ; his
most ingenious is a sun-clock which
keeps accurate time without the qecessity
for correction tables.
Assumed command of Eastern Area,
Air Vice-Marshal F. M. (“Dad”) Bladin,
C.8.E., who has settled down at Brad-
field Park after handing over the job of
Chief-of-Staff to the 8.C.0.F. in Japan to
“Blackjack” McCauley. Bladin has been
places and seen things since Hitler took
off the lid. A.O.C. Southern Area when
it was first formed, he went to Britain
and was Air Staff-Officer with the R.A.F.
for D-Day, and was with Second T.A.F.
for 12 months. Returning to Australia,
he became Deputy C.A.S., taking over
from McCauley, who went off to UK.
Before he went to England Bladin had
a term as A.O.C. N.-W. Area with H.Q.
m Darwin during the hectio days of Jap
bombing. He went oh many raids ahd
earned the U.S. Silver Star and the
thanks of General Kenney for a good job.
He had a second spell as Deputy C.A.S.,
and for a while held the post of Direc-
tor of R.A.A.F. Organisation and In-
telligence. He and McCauley have
swapped jobs six times. “Dad” is senior
in rank to all the members of Air Board
except the Chief-of-Staff himself.
Bound for the Imperial Defence
College on the Stratheden is 48-year-old
Brigadier Eric Winslow Woodward,
0.8. E., D.S.O. —one of the few Army
officers wearing R.A.A.F. wings. As well-
known as any A.I.F. officer in the desert,
he collected both his “gongs” in the
Tobruk and El Alamein stunts. When
he gained his commission at Duntroon in
1920, he went to the Indian Army for
15 months’ hard training with the Light
Horse. Sick of the saddle by 1925, he
exchanged it for the R.A.A.F. cockpit.
After three years of flying his love for
the Light Horse won and back he went to
khaki. In recent months he has held the
appointment of Director of Staff Duties,
Australian Military Forces.
“Becks” on the Edinburgh dukedom:
Revival of the Edinburgh dukedom for
Philip Mountbatten is doubtless intended as
a compliment to Scotland, but the title has
interest to Australians as the last Duke of
Edinburgh—Alfred, second son of Queen Vic-
toria —was the first sprig of Royalty to visit
this country. He came here in H.M.S. Galatea
in 1867 as a young man round about Philip’s
age, made a good impression on the citizenry,
laid a batch of foundation stones, had his
name bestowed on several pubs—two each in
Melbourne and Sydney—and was shot in the
back at Clontarf, Sydney—Parkes had the assail-
ant hanged. That Duke had the distinction
of haying declined three thrones. When he
was six he was suggested as a possible king
for the German State of Thuringia, and a few
years before his Australian visit Victoria turned
down the Royal thumb at an offer of the
Greek throne, then being hawked round Europe;
Alfred had topped the poll in a plebiscite.
Later, when the fate of Turkey was being
considered, Leopold of Belgium wanted to
make him King of Constantinople. The Duke
was not impressed. In 1874 he married a
daughter of Alexander II of Russia and in
1893 succeeded h's uncle as Duke of Saxe-
Coburg-Gotha, relinquishing the Edinburgh title
and annuity. He died in 1900. An earlier
Duke of Edinburgh was Frederick, Prince of
Wales, son of George 11. Like most of the
Hanoverian princes, he was continually .at
loggerheads with his father; he was unique
in that he died as a result.of a blow from a
tennis ball. Philip’s other titles, Earl of
Merioneth and Baron Greenwich, pay tribute
to Wales and to his connection with the Royal
Navy.
Thirty-two years in the R.A.F.—it was
called the R.F.C. when he joined it in
1914 —is the record of Air-Commodore
F. M. F. West, V.C., C.8.E., M.C. His
V.C. came to him on Armistice Day,
1918, “for outstanding bravery in aerial
combat,” and his M.C. was also won in
the first war, in which he lost a leg. The
more recent scrap, in which he was Air
Attache in Italy and Switzerland —
previously in Finland, Estonia, Latvia
and Lithuania —and Director of Foreign
FILMS.
Liaison at the Air Ministry, brought him
the C.B.E. Since leaving the R.A.F. he
has been associated with the British film
industry and is now managing-director
ot Eagle-Lion Distributors. West’s job is
to sell British films to the world, and in
the last 12 months he has visited, with
considerable success, almost every
country of Europe; even behind the
Iron Curtain he managed to persuade the
Bolish and Czech Governments to sign
on the dotted line—one for 40 films, the
other for 20. Prior sketched him just
a «er his arrival in Sydney for a tour
which will cover all Australian States.
'Twenty-seven-years-old medico Henry
Rischbieth becomes medical superinten-
dent of Adelaide Children’s Hospital in
succession to Eric Sims, who goes into
private practice. Rischbieth served as a
surgeon-lieutenant in the R.A.N. during
the war. When he graduated at Adelaide
Varsity in 1942 he topped the list in
medicine, came second in surgery and
won the Gosse medal for ophthalmology.
The somewhat forbidding facial expres-
sion and the ironical look about the grey
eye of Dr. R. T. (“Dick”) Kennedy, as
sketched by Heth, may be attributed to
the conversation of the moment —
“nationalisation”—and the fact that two
scribes kept smoking his cigarettes
rather than to normal temperament. The
doc. s favorite topic is Gundagai, where
he was in general practice before chang-
ing his address to Macquarie-street; he
has written articles for the Gundagai “In-
dependent” on local history, has addressed
the Royal Australian Historical Society
on the same subject, and has collected a
surprising—and occasionally startling—-
mass of historical matter, including un-

an axe and charged by a Gundagai bull.
Other interests are poetry—he has
been represented in three Australian
anthologies—and literature generally. At
Sydney Uni. he edited “Hermes,” con-
tributed to other journals and later to
The Bulletin. Also, for a short time,
worked on a newspaper. Smoking the
last cigarette of the interview, he men-
tioned that he intends soon to turn his
documents and notes into a book on the
history of Gundagai.
Professor Frank McFarlane Burnet,
who gets the Royal Society’s gold medal
this year for outstanding biological re-
search, is one of Australia’s leading
scientists and a world authority on
viruses. He started gazing through little
windows let into eggs at the Walter and
Eliza Hall Institute in Melbourne in
1928. Before that he had gained high
distinction at the Lister Institute in
London. He was responsible during the
war for the inoculation of thousands of
soldiers with an anti-influenza serum,
and in 1939 he won the Cilento medal
for research in tropical medicine. Some

Royal Naval School of Music in 1909.
After service in World War I he was
loaned to the R.A.N., transferring two
years later. In 1925 he was given
authority to form the first paval band at
Flinders —hence the nickname “Bandy.”
A first-class fiddler, he studied under
Alfred Hill at Sydney Con. and later was
musical director of the Naval Pageant
held in Melbourne. He and his ensemble
are well known in all capital cities, par-
ticularly Melbourne, where in every war
loan and service march they have paraded.
He will shortly retire after having opened
the first Service School of Music in Aus-
tralia, becoming its director in 1946.

he drove Army transport.
Into the Silence:
In Melbourne, at 92, Thomas Woollard, first
sergeant-at-arms to the House of Representa-
tives. Before that he was usher to the Vic-
torian Legislative Council and after it Clerk
Assistant at Canberra, retiring from the Par-
liamentary service in 1921.
In Melbourne, at 51, George Keith Aikman,
son of a former Lord Mayor. Director of
Swallow and Ariell, F. W. Williams and Co.
and Australian Sisalkraft, he was General
Savige’s aide during the war.
In Melbourne, at 91, Harry Knott, master
builder. His firm built Coles’ Book Arcade,
the Shamrock Brewery and the last private
cable tramway, which ran from Clifton Hill
to Northcote.
In Brisbane, at 68, William McCormack,
Premier of Queensland from 1925-1929. He
entered Parliament in 1912 and before becoming
Premier had been Speaker, Home Secretary and
Minister for Lands. He had natural ability and
force of character, but used up his popularity
rather early.
In Pretoria, South Africa, at 65, knight George
Knowles, Australian High Commissioner. Be-
fore his appointment last year he was Com-
monwealth Solicitor-General and had been
legal adviser to Australian delegations at League
of Nations meetings, Imperial Conferences and
at the Washington Arms Conference.

Women's Letters
From Melbourne
Low bowls of sweetpeas, carnations
and roses decorated the tables set on
lawns and in the marquee of Bishops-
court when Archbishop and Mrs. Booth,
assisted by the Bishop of Geelong, Rt
Rev. J. D. McKie (his brother dispensed
the music in the Abbey for the Royal
wedding), entertained at their garden party
members of the Anglican Centenary
Congress. The guests included Bishops
from England, U.S.A., British Columbia
and Tanganyika. A navy-blue marocain
fitting coat over a pale-blue frock with
sequin trimming on the bodice was worn
by Mrs. Booth with a small navy-blue
straw hat trimmed with matching ribbon
and veiling. Her daughter Joan wore a
flower-trimmed curvette with her tur-
quoise-blue crepe frock.
Two of the most sought-after guests at
the party were the Bishop of Albany
(U.S.A.) and his wife, Mrs. Oldham,
whose powder-blue ensemble was braided
on the bodice and worn with a small
blue straw hat laden with flowers and
grapes. Last year the Bishop and his
wife attended a garden party at Buck-
ingham Palace and met the King and
Queen and the Princesses, with whose
charms they were captivated. Another
pair of guests they were eager to meet
were the Bishop of Litchfield and Mrs.
Woods, whose frock of black lace and
georgette was worn with a black straw
hat trimmed with midnight-blue ostrich
feathers. Mrs. Edmund Herring, who ac-
companied the Chief Justice, wore a pastel
floral blouse with her black dressmaker
suit; blue flowers trimmed her black hat.
Mrs. Peter Sturdee pinned red, blue and
white velvet bows in her hair and was
tailored in a grey suit. Constance Briggs
chose a black sequin-trimmed suit and
small black hat trimmed with veiling.
Mrs. Grant Pringle’s navy-and-white-
patterned frock had matching accessories.
Her sister, Mrs. Guy Bakewell, wore a
platter hat and a black coat over a
dusty-pink frock.
Not only the churches but the laity de-
livered up their treasures to the com-
mittee which arranged the Exhibition of
Ecclesiastical Art, which was a part of
the Centenary Celebrations of the Church
of England in Victoria. St. Peter’s,
Eastern Hill, lent a gold-and-jewelled
embroidered white satin chasuble, a
Humeral veil and robes worn by the
deacon and sub-deacon. Mrs. Hamilton
Sleigh contributed an Ikon painting in
oils on wooden panel of the Madonna,
mounted in gold and enamel and set with
seed pearls. This had been presented to
her husband’s father by the late Czar.
Mrs. G. R. Nicholas sent along a Lalique
Crucifix and . a lovely figure of the
Madonna. Contemporary artists also
added their quota to the Exhibition. The
Rev. Stuart Burnett, a former Chaplain,
arranged a Field Altar ; the vases, candle-
sticks and Crucifix made from shell-cases
by Field Engineers in the Middle East.
A Rochet, a robe worn by a Bishop,
beautifully smocked in fine white linen,
was the work of Gladys Hammond. The
Selection and Display committee was
under the direction of George Ewing,
who was assisted by John Myers and
Minnie Saleere.
The National Gallery showed its appre-
ciation of the pottery fashioned by Klytie
Pate by acquiring a bowl, as perfect in
color and glazing as it is in design. This
, was among many other of her pieces at
the exhibition she held at George’s
Gallery which was opened by Pro-
fessor Bryan Lewis. Klytie, in aqua-blue
draped tunic and pleated skirt and small
blue straw hat with an upturned brim,
received congratulations from a host of
admirers. Thelma Halbert wore a natty
blue jacket with a white skirt and white
straw sailor hat. Mrs. Lindsey Biggins
chose a white linen suit and white hat
finished with a navy fish-net snood.
Susanne, youngest daughter of Mr.
and Mrs. A. Howatson, of Longreach
(Q.), was married at the Toorak Pres-
byterian Church to Lieut.-Col. God-
frey Robinson, sth Royal Gurkhas, only
son of Mr. and Mrs. J. Robinson, of
Hobart. The bride’s gown was of white
crepe, the tulle and lace veil held in place
with orange blossom, her bouquet of
water-lilies. She was attended by her
sister, Nora. Bestman was Lt.-Col. P.
LeMarchand.
Good wishes are pouring in on Audrey,
only daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Maurice
Herring, of Brisbane, who has announced
her engagement to Squadron-leader John
Craig, R.A.A.F., eldest son of Mr. and
Mrs. Leslie Craig, of Dardanup, W.A.
Audrey, who is a cousin of Sir Edmund
Herring, served with the W.A.A-A.F. for
five years and for a period was deputy-
director of that service. After the war
she joined a Melbourne paper. Her
fiance is doing his final exams for a
Master of Surgery degree. John’s mother,
who is a vice-president of the Associated
Countrywomen of the World, is at
present in London and was one of the
few Australians invited to Princess Eliza-
beth’s wedding. Mrs. Craig will be back
in this country in time for the wedding
in March.
Attractive Mrs. Desmond Hollywood,
wife of Dr. Hollywood, of West Mait-
land (N.S.W.), has been visiting her
parents, the Eric Fowlers, of Sunshine.
Educated at Mandeville Hall, Mary
Louise Fowler was sports captain and
captain of the school. Like her mother
before her, Mary Louise went to the
Navy Office, where she was attached to
Intelligence. Broothorn took the photo.
There were many private parties on
Thursday to celebrate the Royal wedding.
That given by Mr. and Mrs. Eric
Fowler at Menzies had a special sig-
nificance for the host and hostess, for
when the Duke of Edinburgh, as Lieut.
Philip Mountbatten, visited Australia with
a R.N. destroyer squadron he was a
frequent guest at their Sunshine home.
Mrs. Fowler wore a patterned-silk frock
of grey and black leaves on a white back-
ground under her black tailored coat;
her small white straw hat was highlighted
with crimson roses. Her daughter, Mrs.
Des Hollywood, wore a floral silk frock
patterned in blue, cherry and petunia
shades and a wide-brimmed Princess-blue
straw hat. Mrs. Peter Avison-Parker was
in a limeflower wool frock, a wide-
brimmed brown straw hat and brown
accessories. Kathleen Pappadakis chose
a navy ninon frock, the bodice tucked
and the skirt finely-pleated. Her up-
turned natural-straw hat was finished with
a cluster of field flowers and fine veiling.
The toast to Philip and Princess Elizabeth
was honored in sparkling burgundy; a
wine he greatly enjoyed here.
Leslie P. Curtis had much to show for
his trip through Queensland and New
South Wales when he held an exhibition
of water-colors at the Kozminsky Gal-
leries. Wife of the artist chose a royal-
blue frock featuring a sequined basque ;
her black hat was of the “coolie” type.
Vivienne Townsend, who went on the
long trip with the Curtis pair, wore a
floral frock which showed the new long
torso line; the skirt was pleated. Mrs.
S. Jonas, in red jersey suit and beige-fox
fur, was accompanied by her daughter
Mrs. J. Markell, whose black dressmaker
suit was worn with a natural-straw hat.
Robert Hamilton, member for Toorak,
opened the exhibition.
A vital little person with a strong sense
of humor, Olga Michailow, daughter of
the noted Bulgarian painter Nicola
Michailow, had an opportunity of airing
her English when she met the Press at a
party given by Margaret Murdoch at
Menzies. Olga has crammed lots of ex-
perience into her short life. With her
father she was caught in Berlin at the
outbreak of war and there remained until
the Russians entered ; then they went to
Sweden. She is an experienced globe-
trotter, living most of her life in hotels
in the countries where her father has
been painting portraits. Court painter to
King Ferdinand, his subjects have in-
cluded many famous Europeans and
Americans. Olga, who is secretary to her
father, longs for a flat in Melbourne
where she can cook and entertain. A
smart dresser, her large brown hat, worn
with a matching frock and beige-fox
bolero, set off her flashing brown eyes to
perfection. Olga hopes to arrange an
exhibition of her father’s work while in
this country, which, for the next six
months, will be their home. After Aus-
tralia the Michailows will go to Mexico,
where Nicola will paint that country s
President.
From Sydney
Not onw their subjects in the many
and far-fltyig lands of their Empire
listened to [me broadcast story of the
wedding oi the King and Queen of
England’s daughter, Elizabeth. All the
world hung breathless on this November
tale of the happy ending to a Royal
romance. When Lieutenant Philip
Mountbatten, now the Duke of Edin-
burgh, spoke his marriage vows in manly
and resolute tones, and Elizabeth said
hers, her voice as tremulous and shy as
the simplest girl in the vast Dominions
over which she will one day be Queen,
it is safe to say that a happy and respon-
sive smile spread all over the face of
the globe.
Listening last Thursday, the scene in
the vast and noble Abbey flashed on the
brain. The rich and solemn pageantry
of Church and State, the joyous clash
and peal of bells, the symbolic surge of
anthem and organ, the bride in her flow-
ing white satins gleaming with pearl and
crystal embroideries, her ’maids, a foam
of ivory tulle, made a picture which lost
nothing in the description.
And somehow to one listener it seemed
that mingling with the sonorous notes
of the organ, and with the clangor of
the bells came a refrain the people of
England used to sing in war-time. They
sang it during the blitz, and it gave them
heart; it went something like this:
The King is still in London, in London,
in London,
Like Mr. Tones and Mr. Brown,
The King is still in London town.
And not only the King but the Queen
and the Princesses, too, had stood by
taking their share of the common danger.
And it was to drive through the cheering,
roaring and tumultuously happy crowds
of her people that the Princess and her
bridegroom finally emerged from the
Abbey. They drove in their glass coach
back to Buckingham Palace along the
Mall, where the trees stretched their leaf-
less boughs. It was a grey day with the
sun breaking through—glad omen for
her own and her husband’s future happi-
ness, glad omen for the undefeatable
land of her birth —a grey day with the
sun breaking through!
Pictured here is Diana Robinson, who
with her parents, Lieut.-Colonel C.
Robinson (Dr. Clive Robinson) and Mrs ;
Robinson, returned to Sydney in the
Orion after a tour of America and Eng-
land, together with a good slice of
Europe. The family stayed four months
in Canada, mostly in Montreal and
Toronto, finding, after their six weeks’
stay in New York, everything much less
expensive. And of course being “Robin-
son” they went to Switzerland,
through which they loitered in perfect
weather—that was another land of com-
parative plenty. Diana loved London
and England, where she renewed many
war-time friendships made in Sydney.

Four thousand guests in all had been
bidden to stroll the lawns of Government
House and rejoice in celebration of the
Royal marriage. Apparently they all
came. By half-past three the grounds
were entirely covered with shifting pat-
terns of bright color. The women wore
their gayest and best, and on many a fair
chest bared by the new neckline freckles
appeared while greetings were being
exchanged. The sun was hot, the sky
blue, the breeze cool. A few English-
garden-party frocks were given an airing.
And thrice blessed were the women who
had unearthed sunshades. Many of these
came out of the family treasure-chest,
such as Mrs. Fyvie Watt’s tiny carriage-
and-crinoline affair with its lush edging
of fringe. Major Joyce Snelling, Mrs.
Florence Taylor and Rosemary Parker
were others who carried sunshades from
a gracious age.
The fountain played in the sunlight, so
did the N.S.W. Police Band. It played
Princess Elizabeth’s wedding march —
Hubert Parry’s composition—and its rich
beauty matched the day. The Governor
and Mrs, Northcott walked among the
guests greeting old friends and having
new ones presented to them. Mrs. North-
cott’s frock of mushroom pink was pat-
terned in black, and her hat was a nice
color toning in pink and grey. Daughter
Elizabeth wore a cool silk frock in grey
and white. Her white hat was of rustic
straw tulle edged.
Mrs. Bertie Kelly was there —her first
big party since her long illness in St.
Vincent’s Hospital. The Bertram Fords
were well-knowns. As May Baker she
was N.S.W. champion woman tennis-
player. Mrs. Marcel Dekyvere was in
black, her skirt pencil-slim. The J. G.
Wilkinsons, their daughter Mrs. Herne
and the D’Arcy Shelleys were lawn-
strollers. Mrs. Charles Lloyd Jones’s
frock of brown - and - white - patterned
silks was among things admired.
So was the ground-length frock worn
by Mrs. Lars Jorstad, wife of the
Minister for Norway. It had a deep cape
collar, and was brightly blooming with
red and blue flowers. The Tom Bate-
mans and her mother and father the Greg
McGirrs and sister Trixie came to the
party —no jewels of higher voltage than
Mrs. Greg’s diamond ear-rings. Dr,
Sterling Levis and his wife, their
daughter Mrs. John Ferris and her hus-
band made a family group. A summer
felt, off-white and wide of brim, was worn
by Mrs. H. J. Brady with her flowered-
silk frock.
During the afternoon official sec-
retary L. A. Robb read a cable
from the Princess acknowledging the
Governor’s one of good wishes on behalf
of the people of N.S.W. By and large,
the party was a great success. There was
a sort of ebb and flow in the tide of
humanity. Faces one knew appeared for
a fleeting second, then disappeared and
were not sighted again. There was
enough ice-cream to stage a snowstorm
on the Southern Alps. Some people got
cool drinks and tea and some got neither.
But all agreed they enjoyed the day.
The Rowe Street Musicals are in the
thick of rehearsals for their production of
“The Lilac Domino.” This year the
company has made the Sydney Industrial
Blind Institute its beneficiary. There will
be two performances of this graceful
and tuneful show —the opening will
be at the Con. on the 29th of this month.
On the 2nd of December the Mosman
Town Hall will be the scene of action.
Doris Rolfe and Ronald Bevan are the
principals, Neil Johnson is the producer.
The ballet and chorus are a clever and
attractive company numbering 50.
Reginald Kirby will be guest of .honor
at the Australian Book Society’s next
lunch on Wednesday, December 3. The
subject of his talk over salad and coffee
will be “Literature and Freedom.” Mr.
Kirby, an Englishman by birth, is Aus-
tralian by adoption. He served with the
Australian Forces in the last war, and his
first novel. Dawn Journey, is arousing
interest.
Tomorrow night (27th) in the Confer-
ence Hall of the G.U.0.0.F., 149 Castle-
reagh-street, the National Council of
Women will hold its general meeting.
This will be an International evening,
and Joyce Cocks will give an account of
the conference of the International Coun-
cil of Women held in Philadelphia last
September. Joyce attended as delegate
from the Australian N.C.W.
Arranged and produced by Heather
Cell, five performances of “The Water
Babies” will be presented at 5.30 p.m.
at the Theatre Royal early in December.
These shows will be in aid of the Kinder-
garten Union of N.S.W., the Sydney Day
Nursery Association, Food for Britain
(Special Theatre Fund) and J. C. William-
son’s Actors’ Benevolent Fund. The first
show will be given on Tuesday, December
2, and the others on the Wednesday,
Thursday, Friday and Saturday follow-
ing. “The Water Babies” is after the
story by Charles Kingsley and is a
pageant play with music, movement and
dramatic scenes.
Mrs. Isabel Wallace-Turner, who for
so many years has brought ardor to he*r
work as secretary for the English-Speak-
ing Union, will be greatly missed at the
E.-S.U.’s councils and reunions. Friends
in England and America as well as Aus-
tralia will regret that she has taken her
friendly personality to other spheres.
Last week Mrs. Wallace-Turner took
over the charge of Hopewood House in
Bowral, where she will have 84 little
children under her care.
Maorilander Newton Goodson, who
goes off to London to study singing at
the end of the year, will give his farewell
recital in the Conservatonum on De-
cember 1 Newton made a hit when he
sang at a recent Austral Chamber Music
Circle afternoon. Eugene Goossens has
been very complimentary about the singer s
voice, given him much good advice about
his studies and has said he desired to be
present at the farewell benefit. Newton is
going overseas on a two years scholar-
ship at the Royal College of Music,
London. This scholarship, however is
for tuition only and does not extend to
living expenses.

* Six months.
During the 12 months covered by the
latest accounts, the co. took over the
Queensland National Bank (paid capital
£1,750,000) and Victoria Arcade, Ltd.
(paid capital £42,000). The latter pur-
chase was to secure a freehold with an
82ft. frontage to Castlereagh-street,
through to Elizabeth-street, Sydney, for
future expansion of the bank’s business.
Both cos. remain intact as wholly-owned
subsidiaries.
The basis of the Q.N, deal was the
issue of five f.-p. £1 shares in the
National for every f.-p. £5 share in the
Q.N. Those unable to convert for legal
or other reasons were paid in cash at £8
(market price) per Q.N. £5 share. The
amount involved was £1,764,375, of which
£1,726,025 was paid in scrip and £38,350
(including £14,385 premium) in cash.
The amount paid for the Arcade co.’s
assets was £135,178 (cash), or £54,749
more than their net tangible book value.
Banking has become more profitable,
owing to the growth in demand for ac-
commodation, which can be expected to
continue. After allowing for taxation
and other contingencies, the National
netted £421,952 (up £67,389) for the year
to Sept. 30, 1947, the Q.N. £92,185 (up
£504) and the Arcade co. £1153, both for
the year to June 30, 1947. Combined
net earnings totalled £515,290, or 7.6 p.c.
on the present £6,726,025 of paid capital.
On capital and reserves combined
(£11,113,269) the £515,290 was 4.6 p.c.
The div. was kept at 6 p.c., and £68,000
(£3OOO of it in respect of the Q.N.) was
written off the book value of premises,
etc.
The following comparison of the
National’s balance-sheet figures illustrates
banking trends:

The growth of £1,726,025 in capital has
already been explained. The increase of
£6,173,535 in deposits and of £10,635,069
in advances reflects a buoyant national
income and general expansion of business
activity. The new shares item is the cost
of scrip in the two wholly-owned sub-
sidiaries.
Here is a view of the entire financial
structure as an amalgamation of balance-
sheet figures of the three cos. shows it:

The Arcade co.’s assets consist of free-
hold £116,220 (cost) and cash, etc.,
£4077, and its outside liabilities total
£65,548, of which £65,000 is secured. The
£6,726,025 of capital is in 8,526,025 £1
shares of which 3,726,025 are fully paid
and the balance paid to 12s. 6d, each.
Net tangible book value of the entire
undertaking is £11,005,705, or 325. 9d,
per f.-p. share and 20s. sd. for those
paid to 12s. 6d. each. Lowest figures at
which the Commonwealth Bank has been
authorised to buy such of the co.’s shares
as came on to the market were 31s. 6d.
for the f.-ps. and 20s. for those paid to
12s. 6d. each. Market price last week-
end was 325. f.-ps. and 225. 6d. for the
others. At these last-mentioned prices
the yield is 3.5 p.c. and 3.3 p.c. respec-
tively on a 6 p.c, div. basis. The dis-
parity in price between the two classes of
shares is due to vagaries of the market.
Tli® economic and social consequences
of nationalisation of the trading banks
make too long a story to be told here.
They amount to the difference between
democratic capitalism, with decentralised,
automatic consumer control, and national
or socialistic capitalism, with highly cen-
tralised State direction and bureaucratic
control. Banking should be the guide,
philosopher and friend of the com-
munity,” says the Prime Minister, for-
getting that one ought to be free to choose
one’s friends, and that, in fact, gratui-
tous assumption of the role of guide and
philosopher smacks of Fascism and the
worst aspects of monopoly.
Shareholders’ interests now centre
firstly in the legal action which is under
way to test the validity of the legislation,
and secondly in what compensation they
are likely to receive if the legislation
survives challenge in the Courts. The
bill says the Act shall come into force
the day it.receives Royal assent. By
notice in the Commonwealth Gazette, the
Treasurer can fix a day on which shares
on the local register of Australian banks
shall be vested in the Commonwealth
Bank. On that day the directors of banks
affected shall cease to hold office. Also,
with approval of the Treasurer, the
governor of the Commonwealth Bank
may appoint new directors in place of
those elected by the shareholders but
removed following gazettal of the notice
just referred to. Moreover, the new
Government-nominee directors are to
have power to dispose of the business
of the bank, including shareholders’
assets, to the -Commonwealth Bank.
A shareholder who fails to deliver
his scrip to the Commonwealth Bank
within twd months' of the shares
becoming vested in that institution is
liable to a penalty of £lOOO. Compensa-
tion to be paid is to be determined by a
Federal Court of Claims, appointed by
the Government and against whose deci-
sions there is no appeal.
It was to prevent the Government tak-
ing peremptory and high-handed action
that the banks sought a High Court in-
junction restraining the Commonwealth
and other defendants from issuing the
notices referred to before the question of
validity of the legislation was tested and
determined in the High Court.
Following an assurance on behalf of
the Government that the bill would not
be submitted for Royal assent before

High overseas prices for lead, zinc and
silver, together with repeal of the war-
time (co.) tax, are mainly responsible
for the extraordinary leap of £746,677 in
last term’s record profit figure, to which
a better return from investments also
contributed. Less ore was extracted and
treated at substantially higher cost.
The net figure claimed in the p. and 1.

The £419,000 overprovided for taxation
is the amount that was set aside for war-
time (co.) tax, and £320,000 of it, equal
to 2s. per ss. share (40 p.c.), is to be sent
out as a special bonus to shareholders
as soon as official formalities wiping the
tax off the statute book are complete.
An interim 9d. a share (£120,000) was
paid and a final 2s. 6d. a share (£400,000)
goes out on Dec. 24, making 3s. 3d. a

In the Australian market, which must be
supplied before export is permitted, the
price of lead and zinc is pegged, and
has been since early 1940, at £22 a ton,
which is now substantially below cost of
production. Prices actually realised by
the co. for lead and silver for the year
to June 30 last were £65 15s. (up £27
18s. 4d.) and ss. Id. (up Is.) respectively;
and the figures have continued to climb
since the close of accounts.
The quantity and grade of ore treated

Metal content of the 45,650 tons lead
concentrate produced was 34,095 tons
lead and 1,724,2620 z. silver, and of the
55,431 tons of zinc concentrate 28,770
tons zinc. Recoveries were 95.9 p.c,
lead, 90.1 p.c. silver and 88.2 p.c. zinc.
Working costs (extraction, development
and treatment) were 20s. heavier at 795.
6d. a ton, which is 495. sd. above the
1939 figure. The increase last term was
due mainly to the higher lead bonus re-
ceived by employees. Weekly bonus pay-
ments ranged from £3 ss. to £8 155., the
average being £5 13s. Total average
amount (wages, lead bonus, etc.) received
per man on full-time employment for the
year was £BlB (£l5 10s. 9d. a week), as
against £645 for the previous term.
Average number employed on the mine
during the year was 1040.
Prospects of the co. making an equally
good showing for the current term are
encouraging, despite rising costs. Export
price of lead recently varied between
£A9O and £AIOO a ton, and silver is
selling freely on the London market at
the equivalent of 4s. 6.15 d. (Aus.) an
ounce. The zinc concentrates are sold
mainly to Electrolytic Zinc (Tas.) and
Imperial Smelting Corp. (Eng.). World
prices for lead and zinc are closely linked
with industrial activity in U.S. While
that remains high prospects for the
world’s lead and zinc mines are good.
Lead looks like being in short supply
for some years.
At June 30 the South’s ore reserves
were conservatively estimated at 1,915,000
tons, up 25,000 tons. Allowing for further
development of known ore bodies, it is
not expected that there is much more
than nine years’ work ahead of the mill.
The co. is therefore on the hunt for new

been inspected and turned down. The
old Zeehan field (Tas.) is being vigorously
scout-bored in association with North
Broken Hill; a geophysical survey of a
new area at Broken Hill (N.S.W.) is
under wav ; and two areas in Queensland
—2900 sq. miles in the Chillagoe district
and 1550 sq. miles on the Cloncurry field
—are being examined in the hope of
finding enough ore of economic grade to
justify resumption of mining and treat-
ment on a large scale.
When the books closed the mine figured
at £232,893, plant £1,334,434, shares and
debentures in other cos. £1,495,195, and
current assets (stores, debtors, cash, etc.)
£2,363,260. Including provision for taxa-
tion and royalties (£606,315 net), outside

The latest accounts made their appear-
ance before Mr. Chifley’s new Budget.
Removal of war-time (co.) tax should
make net profit for 1947 rather better
than the declared £25,524, which is itself
an improvement of £6646 on the previous
term, and represents 21.2 p.c. on capital,
compared with 15.7, 14.1, 1.5, 11.4, 11.1
and 14 p.c. back to 1941. Tax provision
isn’t specified, but plant depreciation
was £lBBO last term, as against £877 in
1946. The board offers no comment on
last year’s improvement or on the chances
of its being maintained—except that 5 p.c.
of the handout has been characterised as
“bonus,” as was p.c. in 1946.
The foregoing table covers the whole
life of the holding co., which was formed
10 years ago with £120,000 paid capital
(issued at 20 p.c. premium) to acquire
the old-established and successful busi-
ness of William Atkins, steel and iron
merchant and supplier of engineering and
motor requisites. The proprietary’s 75,000
£1 shares had net tangible asset backing
of £123,749 and were brought into the
holding co.’s books at £69,000 above par.
Mr. Atkins received net payment of
£96,000 cash plus 20,000 shares in the
holding co., of which he has remained the
chairman.
Although the taciturn board makes no
comment on trading operations, balance-
sheet movements since 1945 suggest sharp
increases in turnover, with demand now
outstripping supplies. Last term book-
debts rose by £6292, whilst stocks fell by

cern, for a while at any rate. Steel im-
ports are arriving iij better quantities,
and local output is gradually recovering.
The co.’s £1 shares have net tangible
asset backing of 265. 4d. each on com-
bined book-values, and are currently
priced around 545. (465. four months ago,
and pegged at 295. until last January).
Yield at 545. is 5.5 p.c. on a 15 p.c. div.
basis, or 3,7 p.c. from a 10 p.c. div.
It is difficult to say exactly what lies
ahead of Enterprise of New Guinea Gold
and Petroleum. It hasn’t enough funds
to re-equip and operate its mine at Edie
Creek (New Guinea). Everything de-
pends upon whether it is able to sell the
property, and on what terms. It has
been trying, without success, to get a
Government licence to prospect for oil in
the Sepik district since before the war.
Damage to the mine at Nos. I and 2
levels is greater than expected, and more
compensation is being asked for. No. 3
level has not yet been re-entered. At
end August last the co. held £1642 in
stores, etc. (£467) and cash, etc. (£1175).
Creditors figures for £476.

SUNDRY SHOWS
Thea Rowe.
Back in 1940 Sydney lost one of its
best “little theatres” —and one of its best
actresses and producers—when Thea
Rowe went out of business —to the usual
difficulties confronting anyone trying to
produce plays in Sydney was added a
ruling by the authorities that her theatre
was not a good fire risk. There are, how-
ever, at least several little theatres, but,
to this commentator’s knowledge, there is
no one in these parts presenting anything
like or anything as good as the pro-
grammes of medieval ballads, folk-songs
and nursery fhymes which Thea Rowe
turned to after she parted with her
theatre.
The material collects like a snowball,
The core of it was gathered from second-
hand shops, libraries and collections and
has been added to by audiences all over
N. S. Wales and Queensland who recall
old songs and nursery rhymes passed
down through their families; even
Diggers—Thea Rowe teamed up with
Army Education, and gave many concerts
for Australian and U.S. troops during the
war —got into odd corners after shows
and, with some embarrassment, sang
genuine old folk-songs passed on to them
by their grandparents.
Present commentator dropped in on a
current Sydney performance by Thea
Rowe the other night—there’ll be an-
other at the Macquarie Auditorium on
December 3 —just in time to hear Miss
Rowe explain that “John Peel” is modern
as folk-songs go, written barely 100
years ago by John Woodcock Graves to
laud his fellow Cumberland farmer, John
Peel, and set to an old air called “Bonnie
Annie” which they’d heard a grandmother
singing to one of the children. Follow-
ing which commentary Miss Rowe
rendered a most unexpected and unique
version of “John Peel.”
There’s similar originality and lively
humor in “Ca’ Hawkie,” an old
Northumberland song about a much-
harried old woman trying to dispense
advice on love and marriage to some
young girls and at the same time get her
cow home across the stream ; in “The
Laird of Cock Pen” ; in “Mistress Bond”
and her troubles with her ostler, a travel-
ler and a duck ; in “Mowing the Barley, ’
“Trottin’ to the Fair” and “Good
Morrow, Gossip Jones,” published in
“Pills to Purge Melancholy” about 1700,
but written long before that to an air
which was also used in the “Beggar’s
Opera.” Miss Rowe has something inter-
esting to say about all of these, and her
singing and miming in each song are so
good that half the time it seems as though
she has the stage populated with cows,
ducks, horses and other strange intriguing
characters from her repertoire.
It’s also intriguing to know that,
for instance, there are 18 versions of
“The Wraggle Taggle Gipsies” in Scot-
land and England and 17 in America,
although it’s difficult to see the need for
any version other than that sung by Miss
Rowe, who on her own peoples) the
stage with the Gipsy lord Johnnie Faa,
the Lady Cassilis who runs off with him
and the Earl of Cassilis who chases the
pair of them. Then there is “There’s
Nae Luck Aboot the Hoose” —sung at
the request of the Gloucester at Can-
berra —which is also known as the mag-
pie song because all the magpies in N. S.
Wales seem to know! it, having learnt it,
presumably, from early Scottish settlers.
And so on through an excellent pro-
gramme—“Whummil Bore,” an old Scot-
tish ballad; “Om Ilkley Moor,” fronf
Yorkshire; “Widdicombe Fair,” from
Devonshire; Scottish songs and Irish
songs; the lovely “I Know Where I’m
Going” and the equally lovely “Blow the
Wind Southerly,” based on a fragment
of an old Northumberland pipe tune. All
of them so well sung and acted that it’s
easy to understand why a principal of
the N. S. Wales Teachers’ College likes
every teacher under him to see Thea
Rowe’s work before they go out to
teach; or why both children and adults
glance about the theatre for the ghosts
of Molly Malone, of the swagman when
Miss Rowe sings those songs ; or why
a woman at Murwillumbah hurried out
of the theatre, grabbed her youngster out
of bed and rushed it back to hear Miss
Rowe sing “Twinkle, Twinkle, Little
Star.”
"The Magic Flute."
When Bernard Shaw remarked that
the music which Mozart wrote for the
high priest Sarastro was the only music
he felt “could be put into the mouth of
God” he must have had particularly in
mind that noble air “Within These Hal-
lowed Walls.” The rendition of that and
of other numbers only slightly less in
stature by basso Frank Lisle contributed
much to the successful presentation of
“The Magic Flute” by the Sydney Con-
s'ervatorium Student Opera School under
the artistic and sound production of
Hilda Mulligan and the conductorship of
Florent Hoogstoel.
Schikaneder’s libretto may be, on cold
analysis, a strange hotchpotch of light-
hearted Eastern symbolism, black magic
and philosophical profundity, but that is
forgotten under the spell of the wondrous
stream of melody that binds it together.
Donald Graham shook the feathers of
his Papageno in merry style and combined
well in the famous duet with Margaret
Kerr, who brought beauty, acting ability
and a delightful lyric soprano to the
role of Pamina. William Gates was suit-
ably dignified as the Speaker of the
Temple, and George They as the
Egyptian prince raised a light tuneful
tenor —he could have shown more ardor
on both musical and dramatic sides.
Choruses, particularly of the priests, were
full-blooded.

A Bulletin man was nearly thrown
out of the Melbourne Town Hall on a
recent evening, the occasion being one
of Professor Heinze’s concerts for youth
of the stipulated age of not more than
250. The superabundance of young
people with not a single bald head south
of the footlights was inspiring—there is
hope in an audience of young people.
Some of them may try to become practi-
tioners of the art before they get a sur-
feit of listening to it. No better leader
could have been provided than the Or-
mond professor—his explanatory pre-
amble to the Tschaikowsky Pathetique
Symphony was a model of elucidation.
His remark that every conductor put a
different interpretation on the composer’s
four-live time in the second movement set
his audience guessing, but it gave up
analysis for relaxation when Tschai-
kowsky’s lovely melodies poured through
the auditorium. The veteran Dr. Floyd
also prefaced his performance of
Handel’s organ concerto in B flat with
an exposition. The springlike “Walk to
the Paradise Garden” of Delius and the
fiery “Carnival Remain” of Berlioz
brought the evening to a triumphant con-
clusion.

Sydney Tiv.’s Christmas special, “Starry
Way,” is its best effort in months.
Although married for 23 years, George
Formby can still argue wittily and with
complete success against his wife, and
on the strength of that phenomenal per-
formance alone is well worth seeing.
Later, when he embeds his tombstone
teeth in songs selected by the audience,
he is even better. Heller and Riley do
exceptionally well as a pair of prize
angoras and even better when they take
to singing, and Cy Langdry does a
clever Indian dance. The best of many
acts, however, is that of Cabot and Dres-
den, described in the programme as “a
new thrill in dancing,” which is, oddly,
a great understatement. Cabot holds his
partner aloft and spins like an ice-skater
until she disappears in a blur of speed.
The pair of them follow that with some
gyrations which can only be admitted as
possible after they have been seen.

Mosman Theatre Guild is presenting
“To Kill a Cat” at Mosman Town Hall,
and every member of the cast, including
the cat and the corpse, has a motive for
murdering Lillian Proust, Everyone, too,
except the fummy, has the means and
the opportunity, so the audience is kept
in a pleasant state of bewilderment until
each suspect is eliminated. Mary Hosk-
ing plays Lillian Proust, the woman who
uses her money to dominate everyone
around her, with some sound and fury,
although a point she misses is that the
character, in its loneliness, is occasion-
ally a figure for pity. The rest of the cast
make a very good fist of the play, al-
though it’s a pity the part of the cat has
to be taken by a stuffed stand-in.

An array of situations and plots within
plot are ingeniously interwoven in Dodie
Smith’s comedy “Call It a Day,” pre-
sented by Sydney’s Kuringai Theatre
Guild at the Killara Hall. Since the three
acts involve nine scenes in eight different
settings, scenery has been wisely, or per-
force, dispensed with, and with a trifle
of furniture the players make a good job
of creating their own atmosphere against
a black backdrop. Elspeth Edwards,
Norma Barker and O. D. Bisset turn
in particularly good performances —in
fact, only one or two of a large cast are
not right up to the mark. At times the
company as a whole gives the impression
of having bitten off a trifle more than it
can chew, but on the whole it manages
to assimilate it tolerably well.
At the Films.
“Her Husband’s Affairs” (Sydney
Lyceum); A stretch of celluloid lunacy
developed around the invention of a
cream, the by-product of an embalming
fluid, which removes whiskers without
brush and blade. Franchot Tone is
the advertising man trying to keep
up with each development, Lucille
Ball the wife who helps him, Mikhail
Rasumny the scientist who invents the
stuff and Gene Lockhart the tycoon who
markets it. Funny most of the way, with
some touches of satire on advertising and
big business.
* * * *
“Cloak and Dagger” (Sydney Regent);
Gary Cooper as a physicist turned spy to
trail through Switzerland and Italy and
assess German knowledge of nuclear
energy. There are a couple of savage
murders, a hand-to-hand stoush of some
ferocity and some incidental romantic
business with Italian rebel Lilli Palmer
before Mr. Cooper hoists the Italian
research genius aboard an aircraft and
carts him back to the home camp.

“Golden Earrings” (Sydney Prince
Edward): Revealing exposition of the
Gipsy war effort. Just as British agent
Ray Milland can feel the hot breath of
the Nazis on his neck, Marlene Dietrich,
speaking in staccato monosyllables like a
Choctaw Indian, dressed in rags and
allegedly smelling of jasmine and codliver
oil, saves him and substitutes romantic
clutches almost as tenacious as the Nazis’.
Mr. Milland eventually eludes both and
returns to England with a poison-gas
formula. Then, after the war, he lights
out for Germany and his gipsy again—
an action possibly explained by post-war
neurosis or the high price of smokes in
the Old Dart.

Fine Fettle may not quite have been, as
his rider said he a good thing beaten in
the Williamstown Cup—not with Columnist in
his present form —but he had a very stylish win
in Saturday’s Eclipse Stakes at Caulfield. Con-
stable did the pacemaking, with Nagation close
up running a good race, while Heather had
Fine Fettle no further back than fifth at any
stage. It was still Constable into the straight,
though the others were closing up on him,
and hitting the front barely a hundred yards
from the post last year’s winner, Propontis,
looked like doing it again. Then Fine Settle
came along with a crackling finish to win by
half a neck. Finishing on well for third money
was the three-year-old Lungi, whose full-brother
Simpkin (Dhoti-Chapani) is shaping very
promisingly in Sydney.
Last of the important Spring Handicaps, the
Eclipse was worth £1750 to the winner—Fine
Fettle’s best to date. Fine Fettle is a five-year-
old entire by the imported Bosworth horse
Tudor King.
A close finish was anticipated between
Bengal and Amritsar, equal favorites at twos
for the Stansmore Two-year-old, but Amritsar
failed to play the part, finishing a distant fourth.
Clocking the excellent time of 59£sec., Bengal
(H. Badger) was untroubled t# beat Bartolus
and One Up, who, like the winner, is a Dhoti
colt. What will be interesting is the next
meeting of Bengal and Scotwyn.
Because of his good win the previous Satur-
day Lord Campbell started a solid favorite
for the six-furlongs Rosstown Plate, but didn’t
find Caulfield as much to his liking as the
“straight six” at Flemington. Nevertheless,
after missing out at the start, he made up a
lot of ground to head Unfurl for second
money behind the St. Magnus mare Kind Link.
The six-furlongs trip was knocked out in
I.lo*.
Starting favorite at 7 to 4 in the Pelham
Handicap for three-year-olds, Cronides lost all
chance by acting the goat as the barrier
went up; with 9st. he was conceding a lot of
weight all round and had no hope of making
up the ground lost. A mile event, the Pelham
went to Dick Turpin (W. A. Smith); an apt
bit of naming, according to punters —he started
at fifties.
As times indicate, conditions were again
exceptionally fast, and David Star (G. Godfrey),
in scoring a runaway win from Hulong and
Gold Rein in the Tara Steeple of 19 furlongs,
clocked 4.24, knocking two-and-a-half seconds
off the previous course record.
The first of two divisions of the Ormond
Handicap over nine furlongs saw the Helles-
pont gelding Tamerlane (D. Cameron) account
for Lunar Lynx and Edward John. In the
second division Star Shell, Bannerette and
others were beaten hollow by the favorite Allied
Power (S. Henry), a full-brother to The Diver,
who earlier in the day had won the Camden
Handicap at Randwick.
» * * *
Though some fields were small —three adding
up to only 14 runners in all —Saturday’s racing
at Randwick promised to be interesting, par-
ticularly the trio of two-year-old events. There
were five in the Kirkham Stakes, all winners:
Midwise, winner of the Gimcrack and second
at her only other start; stablemates Simpkin
and Phalanx, each two starts for a first and
a second; and Grey Nurse and Huarette,
each a winner at her previous two starts. The
makings of a great race; but it was blotted
out.
As they paraded ready to go on the track,
the sky from the south was lowering and
darkening at an alarming rate. Going out they
were greeted by the first heavy drops; trotting
round they vanished into a wall of rain. From
the members’ stand one couldn’t see the end
of the straight.
For once there was no cry of “They’re
off!” Instead it was “There they are!” as
vague shapes could be made out approaching
the turn. As they passed the leger the course
announcer opened his broadcast with the re-
mark that Midwise was in front. She held
her advantage to the finish, Simpkin coming
home gamely but floundering all over the shop
and only heading Grey Nurse for second money.
The conditions were so unusual that it might
be unwise to accept the result as a final
assessment of the relative merits of these five
good youngsters. Even so, Midwise’s perform-
ance was a fine effort. With a 101 b. penalty
she had 8.10, conceding the two colts 51b.
and the other fillies 101b'. Moreover, her
rider, W. Cook, accumulated 71b. extra on the
way round, including a pint or so in each
boot: Munro on Simpkin weighed in 91b. over;
he’s a shade bigger (or less small) than Cook,
so there were a few more square-inches of his
pelt to hold the wet. Anyway, with all that
against her, and in the shocking going, Midwise
ran the five furlongs in 1.1* —only a half-second
worse than she clocked in winning the Gimcrack
on a good track.
Other two-year-old events were the Maltine
Stakes for fillies and the Hoxton Park Juvenile
for their brethren. Modulation’s half-sister
So Sweet (by Le Grand Due) appeared to have
the • Maltine at her mercy, started favorite
at 10 to 9, and led throughout to down Sheba
and Revenir. Conceding most of them halt
a stone, So Sweet clocked one minute; that
was ante-deluge. Also favorite (at 5 to 4), the
'Nuffield colt Cadet downed Benvolo, High
planet and others in the Hoxton, a runner
in which was Bernbrook, a full brother to
Shannon. Bernbrook was unruly before the
race, but looks the part, and showed promise
in his run.
Aptly enough the seven furlongs Camden
Handicap, which followed the Kirkham flood,
went to The Diver, a five-year-old by The
Buzzard from Land and Sea. The ram by
then had eased to a steady fall, but riders
were busy dodging flying clods of turf and
mud. Running last at the half-mile, The Diver
made up ground from that point and finished
well on the outside to beat Dutchman and
Bay Rex. The winner started second favorite
at fours. Completing the main double, the
12-furlongs Warwick November Handicap went
to favorite Courier (R. Kerrigan), proving too
strong at the finish for New Cashmere and
Cape Neddick.
Revelling in the mud, Johnny Zero won the
Welter with a remarkable run from pretty well
“There, mister , that oughter save y' a stroke!"
last at the turn. He beat Fra Diavolo by six
lengths, with Chatipur third. Only four horses.
Monsoon, Mazzara, Arabian Prince and Cherry
Lad, contested the Encourage and, after a
muddling-run 12 furlongs, passed the judge m
that order.

Though long departed the country and since
dead in America, Beau Pere continues as a
powerful influence on N.Z. racing through his
many progeny at stud there. The New Zealand
Cup, run on Saturday, went to Beau le Havre,
lumping 9.3 to down last year’s Derby winner,
Royal Tan. Beau le Havre is a son of the
Beau Pere horse Beau Repaire. The N.Z.
Derby went to Liebestraum, a son of Beau
Vite and Serenata, the dam herself a New
Zealand Cup winner.

Once-a-year racegoers will be making their
visit in a good cause if they join the regulars
at Randwick next Saturday—the S.T.C.’s Food
for Britain meeting. Donated prize-money
will total more than £5OOO and make for
good racing. Paddock bookies have con-
tributed £2OOO, with more to come from the
leger men; the Bloodstock Breeders’ Associa-
tion has given £7OO, the Totalisator people £6OO,
and a host of individuals have tossed in goodly
sums.

Indian tour:
The Indians are very popular everywhere,
and thoroughly deserve to be. They play the
brightest variety of cricket, and compel, or
inspire, the opposition to do likewise. Their
defeat, at S.C.G., of an Australian XI which
included Bradman made as good a match as
Sydney has seen, because cricket can t be
better than that. , . _ x
The Australian side—thanks chiefly to Hon s
hundredth hundred and sftmc over —had a 50-
odd lead on the first innings. Then, in their
second whack, the Indians declared with 9
down for 304, putting it up to the opposition
to see if it could score a couple of runs a
minute in the time left, and win; a sporting
challenge, the sporting answer to which put
the cap on the game as the best sort of
cricket anyone could hope to see. The Aus-
tralians went in and hit, and Mankad, who
can bowl all day without a break, bagged 8
for 84.
India, by 47 runs; and may there be more
of it.
W. Brown (Q.) well and truly deserved his
unorthodox run-out by Mankad. The Indian
bowler stopped in a trundle-up and warned
hirri about leaving his crease, which Brown was
doing by feet. Brown keeping the racket up,
Mankad very rightly swept the bails off in
another run-up instead of bowling.
Against Queensland at Brisbane the tourers
lost the toss, and another solid innings by
Morris (115) helped Q. to a first innings total
of 341. Mankad, who has played in every
match of the tour, again pulled the Indian
side through, taking 6 for 76 —four clean
bowled and two l.b.w. India had 249 on tne
board for five wickets at stumps on Saturday;
Amarnath 101 and still smiting, as he still was
when the Queensland score was passed on
Monday. . . . •
Westralia certainly has made a striking entry
into Sheffield Shield—defeat of South Aus by
an innings and 124 runs: Westralia, 444; S.A.,
109 and 211. O’Dwyer bagged 8 of the S.A.
wickets for 103; Puckett, 5 for 105.
Victoria’s first-innings 436 was too much for
Queensland in the Shield: Q., 267 and 238;
Victoria hitting up the needed 70 for a seven-
wickets win. Morris, who’s shaping very well
this season, scored 65 and 120. A. Jinks
(Vic.) took 9 for 117.
Harvey, Harvey and Harvey among them
hit up 148 of Victoria’s first-innings 331 in
the Shield match against N.S.W. at S.C.O.
(Merv Harvey 45, Neil 61 and Ray 43). dq
fore Saturday’s deluge washed them all off
the ground N.S.W. had lost three for 10.
Barnes (just back from overseas and rushed
into the team) went for a blob.
Bill Johnston, newcomer in the Australian
side for the first Test against India in Brisbane
this week, is a 25-year-old Victorian who has
taken 13 wickets for 363 this season. He took
6 of them (for 96) for Victoria against India.
* * * *
Conditions were against the Wallabies
. in their encounter with Scotland, but bad
luck was very much against the Scots,
who were leading 7-3 in the second half
when their outside centre, T. Wright, had
to be helped off with a dislocated
shoulder. Still, the Wallabies’ score was
a try, the Scots’ a penalty and a field
goal; and the Aussies held the Scots out
while adding three more tries and a
couple of goals, to win their first inter-
national match 16-7.
That Llanelly engagement must have
been pretty good, going by these extracts
from the Cardiff “Times’s” description of
the comparatively mild Australia v. Car-
diff match:
“Crash, bang, crash! ” went the defenders,
and players were soon lying about the field
nursing injuries. I saw tough spectators
wince as Matthews, Cleaver and Gwyn
Evans crashed into their men. I heard
female watchers groan as man after man
lay winded and bruised in the heat of battle.
When the whistle came for no-side two
Australians were borne to the dressing-
room in the arms of St. John ambulance
men, as Haydn Tanner, greatest of playing
Rugby men, was held high by his fellows.
Trainers and doctors had as much run-
ning to do as the players, and medical
men of both sides were in turn the helpful
and the helpless.
They play it the hard way, these Welsh-
men.

Katoomba Gold Cup carnival, prob-
ably the biggest amateur golf picnic in
Australia, drew the usual good crowd of
champs and rabbits this year. The
course was in splendid condition, arrange-
ments near perfect, the 400 or so visiting
golfers well catered for. The Gold Cup
went to a Roseville four with a net score
of 546 strokes for the 36 holes. Big
Jim Grant, the Lakes amateur, broke the
course record with a gross 66, three under
par and a net 60.

The inter-State tennis match J4.S.W. v.
Victoria for the Mars Buckley Cup was
a very close go, the result hinging on the
outcome of the final match, in which
Dart and McCarthy (N.S.W.) played
Harry Hopman and George Holland.
The N.S.W. pair had youth on their side,
and, after beginning erratically, to lose
the first set 3-6, they took the following
sets 6-3, 6-1.
Most pleasing feature of the Sydney
tennis was the form shown by the two
most promising young Davis Cup hopes,
George Worthington (N.S.W.) and Frank
Sedgman (Vic.). Worthington produced
the best yet seen from him to beat Davis
Cup player Colin Long in straight sets.
Sedgman fell victim to Quist’s experienced
wiles, but subsequently defeated Worth-
ington 3-6, 6-1, 6-2. Partnered by Long
in the doubles, Sedgman again proved
superior to Worthington partnered by
Quist.
* * * *
Frank Flannery (8.134:) beat Filipino
Little Paras (8.10 i) at Melbourne Stadium
—or, at any rate, Little Paras lost. He
hit the canvas in the twelfth round and
was disqualified because nobody was
noticed to have hit him.
* * * *
Remembering his defeat by Rex
Murphy last month, Tommy Ward (10.6)
fought differently when he again met
Murphy (10.8) at Leichhardt. Tearing in
as each round began, Ward this time took
the lead early and held it safely for a
win on points.

DESTRUCTION OF A WILL
does not revive an earlier one
Tk/fANY people imagine that by
destroying a Will they auto-
matically revive an earlier one;
that is not so.
To make the earlier Will effec-
tive it is; necessary either to re-
execute it or to make a Codicil
thereto, expressing the intention of
reviving it.
This illustrates the necessity for
consulting a Solicitor in all matters
relating to the making of your
Will.
It is just as important to provide
for a competent Executor and
Trustee to safeguard the interests of
your dependents. The carrying out
of the terms of your Will calls for
attention to highly technical matters.

The Buoyant Sharemarket
Prices of representative shares in Aus-
tralia have gone to a record level. Last
week the Sydney industrial-share index
rose to 187.87, compared with 173.85 in
January this year the month that
marked the beginning of the end of
Treasury control —and 135.46 in January,
1940, when a “phony war” atmosphere
persuaded investors that business was go-
ing to be better than usual. The retail-
share index stood at 195.14 last week,
compared with 178.37 in January, 1947,
and 96.82 in January, 1940. The index
for 34 representative ordinary shares went
to 183.86, against 169,56 last January,
94.74 in March, 1942, 105.36 in June,
1940, and 127,82 in January,. 1940.
One factor that has encouraged higher
prices for some stocks has been the eli-
mination of war-time company tax. This
has affected Barrier mines particularly.
Another has been the buoyant export
income from our primary products, bring-
ing in a record revenue. A third has
been our heavy imports, adding to the
turnover of distributors, wholesale and
retail. During the war years, too, there
has been some growth of shareholders’
funds through profits “ploughed back,”
rarely acknowledged by bonus issues.
One of the most potent factors in the rise
in all share prices has been 'the redun-
dancy of money that exists throughout
the Commonwealth, adding to the spend-
ing-power and investment funds of the
people, and creating inflation in both
turnovers and capital values.
It would cost a great deal more at
present to build and equip any factory
than it would have in 1939. The value of
money has depreciated, and labor is a
great deal more expensive, as well as raw
and manufactured materials. The cost
of imported machinery is particularly
heavy in this country because of the arti-
ficially low value of the Australian pound
when converted into dollars or sterling.
It w'as recently estimated that an Aus-
tralian suburban cottage cost approxi-
mately twice as much to build now com-
pared with before the war, and the same
sort of experience has been the rule in
factory establishment. This inflation
justifies sharemarket revaluation of
stocks, even if the overdone capital-
waterings of 1920 suggest caution, and
even if official price- and profits-control
is inclined to ignore the inflation factor
when businessmen ask for defence against
rising costs in order to protect their
profit-margins. The wage-earner, of
course, has had an automatic rise in
money wages to help compensate him
for the loss of purchasing-power of the
Australian pound, and he has had an
additional loading as Well Vlt has not
been generally so with the industrialist,
and the 1946 profit-summary compiled
by the Commonwealth Bank showed
that money earnings of representative
companies were still, below 1939 levels,
whereas the basic wage has risen from
£3 19s. to £5 12s. since the outbreak
of war.
During the present calendar year there
has been evidence that some companies
are faring better, helped by less industrial
unrest in the coal and other industries.
Broken Hill Prop, has raised its interim
dividend rate to 8| p.c., compared with
p.c. last year and 5 p.c. in the four
preceding terms. Colonial Sugar has
restored \ p.c. to the 8 p.c. paid in 1945
and 1946, and Felt and Textiles has de-
clared \l\ p.c., compared with a previ-
ously steady 10 p.c. Yarra Falls, an-
other textile concern, has declared 12£
p.c., including bonus, against an average
of about p.c. for several years. Tooth
and Co., the big Sydney brewery, has
just declared a final div. of 7 p.c., making
13i p.c. for the year, compared with
13 p.c. in the previous three years, and
12 p.c. before that. Australian Con-
solidated Industries has added a half-
point to its 7 p.c. div., and Dunlbp
Rubber has lifted its ord. distribution
from 5 p.c. to 8 p.c., while Olympic
Tyre has raised its rate from 114 p.c.
to 14 p.c.
A section of the investment list show-
ing a general improvement in dividend

in consumer credit. Cash Orders (Amal-
gamated) has lifted its div. in two suc-
cessive steps from 10 p.c. to 15 p.c.,
Direct Cash Orders paid 15 p.c. last
term, against 10 p.c., and Australian Cash
Orders two years ago raised its all-round
div. from 8 p.c. to 10 p.c., and has main-
tained that rate since. This expansion

The Tariff Adjustment
The cut in the United States import
duty on Australian greasy wool (and
proportionately on woollen.textiles) from
34 cents a pound to 254 cents figures
prominently in the international tariff
agreement to which Australia and 17
other nations have given their consent,
The agreement operates provisionally for
six months, during which period it must
be ratified.
In addition to the United States’ re-
duction in its wool tariff, less important
cuts have also been made in respect of
Australian beef, mutton, lamb and butter
(maximum 50 p.c. reduction); the butter
—we cannot supply Britain with
enough at present—is restricted to
50 million pounds annually, and must
be exported between Nov. 1 and March
31 each year. The U.S. duty on Aus-
tralian apples has also been cut from 15
cents to 12j cents a bushel, while the
existing low duties or duty-free entry
in the case of rabbitskins, sheepskins,
calfskins, sausage-casings, pearlshell and
some metals, including zirconium, copper
concentrates, zinc ores and tungsten, will
be made a permanent thing within the
agreement.
Australia will give the United States
concessions in the United Kingdom, Can-
adian and New Zealand markets, princi-
pally in connection with dried fruits of
most kinds, canned fruits, honey, fruit-
pulp and fruit juices. The preference
granted on Canadian and United King-
dom motor-vehicle chassis has been re-
duced to 2d. and a pound respec-
tively, which will mean that, to that ex-
tent, United States exporters will be able
to compete with Canadian and United
Kingdom car exporters on a better foot-
ing. Primage duties will be abolished by
Australia in many cases.
But the agreement in no way sets aside
Australia’s own arrangements to con-
serve dollars.
Australia has made reciprocal arrange-
ments with Belgium, Holland, France,
Czechoslovakia, Cuba, Norway and
several other foreign countries.
The United Kingdom is widening the
preference on Australian heavy wines
from 4s. to 10s. a gallon. Britain has
also agreed to continue duty-free entry
of our cheese, condensed milk, milk-
powder and other milk products, and will
waive some of her preferential rights in
South Africa, India and Newfoundland.
Australia is to lower the British pre-
ferential tariff on a number of items:
these have been described as “not ex-
tensive, but they have covered a very
wide range of tariff items,” including tex-
tiles. The report tabled in the House of
Representatives last week said that “Aus-
tralia’s ability to grant concessions in the
present British preferential tariff is a
direct result of her increased competitive
position, and is likely to give the United
Kingdom no more than a reasonable
.chance of competition in the Australian
market.”
This aspect, while probably quite truly
represented, should sound a warning to
Canberra of the real need for increas-
ing output per man-hour as world trade
becomes freer and more competitive.
Regarded as a whole, the tariff agree-
ment has several hopeful aspects. The
reduction in the United States wool tariff,
while only half as much as asked for,
shows that Washington for the present
is not completely intimidated by the
Middle West Senate vote, and indicates
that the United States is prepared to
accept world trading responsibilities not
previously acknowledged. Within the
Empire probable results of the agreement
are hard to discern ; in any case, unsatis-
fied demand for most materials and
manufactures will mask effects for some
time yet. But something has been
achieved in the way of tariff rearrange-
ment by the International Trade Organisa-
tion.

LEADING
SINCE 1817
Back in the days when Australia was in
its infancy, the Bank of New South Wales
provided the pioneer merchants and farmers
with all essential banking facilities.
Today, this Bank is still the first trading
bank: first established —first in the number of
branches serving the public —first in the amount
of deposits entrusted to it by the public
first in the volume of advances to the
• *
community.
One hundred and thirty years of honourable
tradition and banking experience lie behind the
services offered by this Bank.

Prices in the U.S.A.
The United States is again very alarmed
about the inflation evident in its costs
and prices. In New York recently hotel
charges took a swift jump, and other
costs seem to be still on the way up. In
June this year the index of U.S. living
costs stood at 153, compared with 126
in February, 1946, 97 in 1939, and 100
in 1937. T . ,
About two months ago the National
City Bank of New York, concerned
about the threat of inflation, decried de-
of “big business” and said
that “the present rise in living costs, and
the danger of further rise, are both attri-
butable mainly to a few foods whose
markets are free and competitive. The
tactics of anti-trust prosecution and de-
nunciation fail to get to the heart of the
inflation problem. It is the immense pur-
chasing-power, the money and the spend-
ing, that is doing the damage.”
President Truman last week asked
Congress for reintroduction of powers to
ration scarce goods and to control prices,
rents and wages, A few months ago it
was thought in some New York economic
circles that prices could be brought down
but for the Government policy of main-
taining high prices for farm products,
which generally meant high food (and
living) costs. Macy’s, the big New York
department-store, started a campaign in
April for lower prices. But the move
was abortive, even though production of
many things in the United States is rising
rapidly.
In July the index of manufacturing
production was 165, compared with 148
in December, 1945, and 77 in 1938. Coal
was being turned out at the rate of 45
million metric tons a month, compared
with an average of about 33 million in
the last three pre-war years. Steel-ingot
output has averaged over 6,000,000 metric
tons a month this year, compared with
34 millions before the war. A high level
of motor-car output has also been re-
gained, and textile production is a record.
Even so, the pressure of credit-expan-
sion is making itself felt in price-levels,
and the middle-West votes make Congress
reluctant to deal with farm-products
costs. Inflation in the U.S.A., of course,
adds to Britain’s burdens in paying for
U.S. food supplies, and influences the
price-levels of the whole world. “Aid to
Europe” is also jeopardised.
Right on the heels of the merger be-
tween Korma Textiles (N.Z.), Ltd., and
Felt and Textiles of Australia, Ltd., has
ceme Korma’s move to join the, small
band of Maoriland million-pound com-
panies. This means an issue of 600,000
new shares, 475,000 ords. and 125,000
prefs. Opportunity to double their hold-
ings is presented to pref. holders. So far
no ordinary" shares have been issued to
the public. Felt and Textiles bought
125.000 ords. in the merger and will add
150.000 from shares up till now unissued.
Directors say a million will be needed to
complete the big textile mill in Auckland
and to stock-up with raw materials,
* * * *
The apparent fall in our export income
during the three months to Sept. 30 is not
serious. Gold figures were a confusing
item in previous years, and, in any case,
it is well enough known that quantities
and values of our major exports, wool
and wheat, are up this year, even though
shipments may be lagging. Export figures
will show the benefit later. The disturb-
ing thing in our overseas trade has been
the steep rise in the cost of imports.
Compared with a decline of £l6 million in
the value of exports (subject to the pre-
ceding qualifications), imports have risen
£37 million in the three months, and the
adverse trade balance has been £2l mil-
lion, compared with a favorable £3O mil-
lion for the corresponding quarter of
1946
* * * *
Against stiff competition Woolworths
(N.Z.), Ltd., continues to hold its own
in the van of Maoriland retail stores, and
vies with the parent Woolworths con-
cern and subsidiaries in Australia in
snowballing profits. Latest results show
a rise of . £15,395 in earnings (£140,762)
for the year ended October 2, after setting
aside £15,000 more for taxation at
£215,000. Total dividend needs of
£110,006 are comfortably covered, and,
after putting £lO,OOO into both insurance
and staff funds, there is £10,756 left to
swell the carry-forward to £46,417. Ord.
shareholders get one per cent, more at
17 p.c., including 2 p.c. bonus. “Satis-
factory” is how the directors’ report
describes results.
# * * *
A tenth subsidiary has been born to
Fletcher Holdings, Ltd., Auckland’s big
building-industry combine, to extend
Fletcher operations to the Pacific islands.
Its birthplace was Apia, Western Samoa,
in October, and authorised capital is
£20,000. There’s plenty of scope for it in
the islands. Manufacture and distribu-
tion of building materials will be part
of its job. The Fletcher family has been
growing at the rate of more than a com-
pany a year since the parent concern
began breeding back in 1941. At the
end of March last shares in subsidiaries
totalled £718,427, and paid capital coin-
prised 700,000 ord. and 50,000 pret.
shares, both classes receiving 6 p.c. over
several years. The subsids. have been well
schooled in their tender years, and at last
balancing date chairman knight James
Fletcher said they had all operated profit-
ably.
* * * *
Sir Robert Renwick, of London Elec-
tricity Supply, criticising the failure of
Britain’s coal industry under nationalisa-
tion, said that if pre-war production per
man-hour was as great as before the war
there would be a world demand for
sterling, adding: “While it may or may
not be necessary for us to go back to
the so-called gold standard, it is essen-
tial for us to go back to the coal standard
and its more progressive equivalent.”
The coal situation has been emphasised
as the crux of Britain’s problem in these
pages to an even greater extent than in
most London papers. Much of the Con-
tinent is similarly afflicted. Until it is
recognised that coal and Communism are
the main barriers to economic rehabilita-
tion in Europe efforts at reconstruction
will mostly amount to beating the air.
* * * *
Informed opinion in London suggests
that the cost of power derived from atomic
energy will be at least 25 p.c. higher than
power obtained directly from coal. An
estimate of the coal reserves of the United
Kingdom is 90,000 million tons —enough,
with an extraction of 300 million tons a
year, to last for 300 years. Britain’s
coal resources are of immense conse-
quence in its future existence, and should
be developed and mined with due regard
to this fact. Efficiency and good work-
ing conditions should be the aim ; politi-
cal manoeuvring and experimentalism
will set the struggling industry back even
further.
* * * ♦
Although Canberra “Labor” has period-
ically been reduced to pleading with
trade-unionists to do a fair day’s work,
to quit striking or to hold off for a time
in their demands for higher pay or shorter
hours it has never done anything really
concrete to block the industrial demorali-
sation all too apparent in the Common-
wealth nowadays. The greater Canberra’s
“powers,” the weaker its resistance to
trade-union anarchy.


ABORIGINALITIES
“Bo”: For years Mrs, Morrissey had
been pegging away vocally for a kitchen
attached to the house instead of the de-
tached bough shed she had been using
ever since the place had been built.
Cracking at last, Morrissey cast about
desperately for the simplest way to do
it. A shack on the river’s edge had long
been disused, and he got permission from
the station-owner to take the relic. After
a lot of effort with a borrowed tractor and
rollers he got it into his property, but as
soon as Mrs. Morrissey saw it she flew
at him. “That thing!” she stormed.
“Why, it’s alive with bed-bugs. Even
the swagmen would rather doss under a
tree than go within yards of it. Take it
out of here as quick as you can.” “YTe
wantin’ it for a kitchen, ain’t y’?” said
Morrissey judicially. “Well, what differ-
ence would a few bed-bugs make —you
won’t be sleepin’ in it, will y’?”
* * * *
“M.U.R.”: I’m one of those blokes
who contend that the wedgetailed eagle,
commonly called the eaglehawk, one of
the most magnificent birds in the world,
is the victim of slander when people allege
that it wreaks great destruction among
lambs. I’m still waiting for someone to
make a statutory declaration that he has
ever seen an eagle take a live lamb, and
even if such evidence does turn up I’m
ready to counter with a similar declara-
tion that I’ve seen eagles take enough
rabbits and hares to pay for the lamb a
thousand times over. Which is why I
have pleasure in noting that in their
“Annual Wool Review,” published this
month, Dalgety and Co. give two pages
to “Australian Pastoral Pests,” and the
eagle isn’t even mentioned.
* * * *
“Ashton”: Had a lesson in hygiene
from a native at Kali, New Britain. We
had stopped for kai, and I opened my
tin of bully, broke off a piece with
my service knife and was cramming it
into my civilised mouth when Mick
nudged me and pointed to one of the
carriers we were escorting. He took his
knife and leaned back, cutting a twig
and a large leaf from the surrounding
foliage. He then laid his portion on the
leaf, which he placed on his knee in
serviette fashion, and munched away
quietly, using the stick as a fork. When
he had finished he carefully rolled the
remains in the leaf and stowed it away
in his kai-bag. I wiped my face and
hands on my shirt and tried to ignore
the whole performance. “What can you
expect from a boong?” I asked
Mick as I kicked my tin of bully into
the scrub,
* * * *
“Old-timer”: On old Mac’s Malice
farm, as far as Mac could see, everything
was ready for a start on the wheat from
the 1001 b. of corned beef in the cask to
the new spiral in the header. “All we
want now is me men an’ ten days’ fine
weather,” he told his missus. At sundown
the sky indicated that the fine weather
was on, and jus before dark two sturdy
coves arrived and announced themselves
as ready for a morning start, Mac yarned
with them after tea and found out that
they knew wheat pretty well; and he went
to bed, after a final glance over the
whispering, moonlit crop, with a feeling
of calm anticipation. In the night he
awoke, hearing a wind that dropped dead
leaves and bits of twigs on the iron roof.
Could be hail in it,” he muttered
anxiously, and got out to have a look.
The moon was setting and the sky clear
He went back and tried to sleep, but the
wind worried him. It dropped, and
Mac, lying in the darkness, felt the air
become hotter. Presently it seemed un-
usually hot, and he started up, staring at
the window, through which shone a fiery
glow. It was only the setting moon, and
he sighed with relief. Back in bed he
thought about the header and couldn’t
remember whether he’d replaced the
broken nut on the straw-walkers. Pre-
sently he took the hurricane-lamp, investi-
gated, and returned satisfied. He was
almost asleep when a flash of light lit
the room. “Gripes, lightning!” he whis-
pered and shot out, but it was only the
headlights of a car turning on the road.
Apart from a dog-fight on the back
verandah, a search for aspirin for his
disturbed missus and a little willy-willy
which rattled the roof at dawn, he suf-
fered no more interruptions until the
missus, dressed and with a cup of tea,
reproached him. “Come on, dear. You
know you wanted to start early and it’s
already seven o’clock. You do like a
lot of sleep.”
* * * *
“Mat’s Mate”: The long cove with the
metallic voice was a full-blown blather-
skite who talked as long as he had an
audience. Mat quickly tired of him.
“Aw, shut up, Long-’un,” he cried.
“You’re like the barber’s cat —all wind and
water.” But for once Mat had met his
match. “Hey,” came back Long-’un. “I’ve
heard o’ that flamin’ cat all over the back
country. Any time a bloke gets up an’
skites a bit they tell him he’s like the
barber’s cat. It never struck me before,
but there must ha’ bin a barber an’ there
must ha’ bin a cat. By cripes, I bin in
a ton o’ barbers’ shops in me time an’
I only ’member seein’ about two with
cats in ’em —one old Hughie Blaxland
had at Forbes an’ a big black-an’-white
fummy in Whyalla—but I’m dead certain
they ain’t the ones ’cos I’d heard it before
I met them. Say, big bloke, what flamin’
“Look out, Auntie—that cow’s swallowed a floating mine!”
barber was it an’ where was it?” Mat
stared at him a moment, then arose and
walked thoughtfully to his bunk.

“Strop”: The Australian habit of im-
provising (B. 22/10/’47) is no doubt born
of the necessity of the pioneers who had
to make all manner of things out of
fencing-wire and binder-twine. Last
week I lost the starting-handle for my old
car and searched the city in vain for
another. I happened to mention the
matter to a neighbor—an old farmer. In
a few minutes he came to light with an
ancient wringer-roller with handle
attached. He stripped off the perished
rubber, hacksawed the cogs from one
end of the spindle, cut a notch in the
end of the rod, and there was the best
starting-handle ever made, with a com-
fortable wooden hand-grip. Nobody but
a farmer could have seen the angel in
the stone, or a perfectly efficient motor
accessory in a bit of backyard junk.
* * • *
“Wippegong”: As remarkable as the
number of birds which turn on the
“broken-wing” act when you approach
their nests is the variety of the perform-
ances. Groundlarks hold a wing, some-
times both, clear above the back, while
chats shuffle along like a diminutive chook
taking a running dustbath. The hooded
robin gives a realistic display: the wing
appears to be busted for keeps and the
bird’s agitation fittingly supports the
bluff. Ducks raise a clatter which im-
mediately draws attention away from the
nest, and sundry smaller fowl all have
their own variations of this common
manoeuvre; but the best performance I
ever saw came from a friarbird. Was out
on the limb from which the nest hung
before the bird moved; then it let out a
“Gracious! Look what’s coming!” sort
of a scream, fell out of its nest, bounced
from branch to branch on its way down
and hit the ground in hysterics. There it
rolled over backwards, emitted horrible
dry-gargling noises, last-gasps and death-
rattles, while giving a physical display
that included the gyrations of a stunned
beetle on a plate, the ghastly antics of a
rooster with its head recently removed,
the lunch mgs of a strychnine-stricken
dog, plus a few innovations of its own.
The whole show was so swift and
astounding that it seemed impossible the
fowl could be aware of anything happen-
ing near it, so I slid down and made for
the whirling mass of feathers. She won ;
I still don’t know what was in that neat
basket, swaying above. That was the
common friarbird, or leatherhead; on
appearances, just about the dullest thing
in the bush. But don’t think, because
there’s no glamor in his make-up, that
there’s nothing beneath that bald skull of
his —and that goes for more than friar-
birds, too.

“Lower Tops’!”: Remote Heard Island
in the Southern Ocean, to which the 2000-
ton tank-landing-ship H.M.S. L.S.T. 3501
is on her way from Melbourne to land a
party of 15 scientists, is one of the most
inhospitable spots on the globe. To
escape the inclement weather the Yankee
sealing gangs who were shore-based there
in the ’7o’s were driven to live under-
ground. The rugged island, which is more
than 25 miles in length and up to eight
in width, stands across the path of the
incessant westerly gales, while its rock-
bound hillsides are largely snow- and
ice-covered —Big Ben Peak, a volcano
(whether intermittent or extinct is not
known), rises to a height of 7000 ft. The
principal inhabitants today are Adelie
penguins and the huge sea-elephants. The
island must be one of the last places out-
side the Polar regions—it is 1000 miles
north of Antarctica—to be mapped. The
crude contours outlining its form on Ad-
miralty charts were made from sketches
made by sealers. The island remained
undiscovered until 1853, when Captain
Joseph J. Heard, master of the American
ship Oriental, bound from Boston to
Melbourne, mistook it at first for an ice-
berg, and then, realising his mistake,
coasted along its shores. This century
the only visitors to them have been an
occasional vessel sea-elephant-hunting,
though the exploration ship Discovery
spent an uncomfortable fortnight there
in November, 1929.
* * * *
“Gravelsnatcher”: A Nor’-Westralian
timber, yeelbia, will replace the imported
balsa wood in air-freight packing-cases if
experiments conducted by Airlines (W.A.)
are successful. It is a trifle heavier than
balsa and about a quarter the weight of
jarrah. Nor’-westers know the tree as
corkwood, and will be surprised to learn
that it has a commercial value. It’s a
small tree, with a rough, cork-like bark,
and timber for cases would appear to be
about its limit. Another nor’-west tree
that once held commercial prospects was
the cypress pine. Cut and trimmed, this
wood looks and smells like sandalwood,
and shortly after the Kaiser’s war a com-
pany of returned soldiers was formed to
market it. They really believed that it
was sandalwood, and were paid for one
shipment. White-ants won’t tackle it, and
it was used as the uprights for the first
huts erected on Yampi. An attempt to
commercialise the timber was abandoned
when the promoter of couldn’t
rediscover the “huge” forest in which he
was going to erect his sawmills. It hasn’t
been found since.

“C.E.”: We were making home the
other evening when we ran into Dave
carrying something carefully in his hat.
“It’s a little yellow-box tree,” he answered
us, displaying a seedling about two inches
high. “I’m going to plant it near the door
of the shack, on the south side. This is
about the sixth I’ve tried there now.”
Jim nosed in with further inquiries, to
Dave’s embarrassment. “Aw, well,” the
tree-planter fidgeted, “you see. I’m think-
ing of gettin’ married, and a man likes to
see his missus enjoy modern conveniences.
As this thing grows she’ll have the
shelter of it for doing the washing.
They grow nice and bushy if you lop
’em off at about 30ft. or so, an’ then with
the branches I can make a bench round
the trunk that will hold the tubs and
things.” Jim nodded. “Yes, but with the
good prices you’ve been getting lately,
wouldn’t it be better to buy some timber
and build a proper place for her to work
in?” “I would,” replied Dave, “only
there’s no particular hurry —Alma’s Ma
believes in long engagements.”
* * * *
“Betcha”: Few things are more mad-
dening than a horse that streaks for some-
where else when a fellow wants to catch
him. And one rogue soon spoils the
bunch, if allowed to run with them. The
trouble is that a ruse that will cure one
may fail dismally with the next. Once a
hard-to-catch horse gets used to hobbles
on his forefeet he can travel nearly as fast
with the things on ; and even a sideline
may hamper but not halt him. Again,
some have more success with a crossed
sideline. Came on Bob the other day,
in desperation hobbling both hind-
legs of his prad. The following
morning when he had to cut the straps
from the swollen legs he abandoned
the brainwave. Hitching on a drag
is a silly practice liable to spoil any hack.
My best success to date is a bolt tied to
the animal’s mane in front, and swung
over its forehead. Care must be taken to
see that the contrivance is not near the
eyes. Unaware of the bolt as he walks

he finds that any other gait is accom-
panied by sharp bangs on his dial.

“Edjudina”: Tell “G’snatcher” (B.
29/10/’47) that his “Binghi cabbage” is
to be found right across the North Cool-
gardiei goldfields. I have dined on it at
places as wide apart as Lake Barlee, Lake
Austin and Lake Carey. It has all the
properties he mentions. To a vegetable-
starved bushwhacker it, boiled and then
made into a hash with a tin of corned
beef, was a dish that reached right down
to a man’s boots.

“Mug”: Twenty years ago the grass in
this district was coarse, thin and patchy.
Then top-dressing came into its own, the
clovers followed, and everywhere farmers
doubled their carrying-capacity. All but
old Pat, who owns an excellent property
and is immensely proud of it. All his life
he has worked overtime on the place, fol-
lowing the methods used by his old man
and his granddad before him. Then,
overtaken by ill-health, he recently de-
cided to let the land for a term. In-
terested, Dan rode over with an offer.
“Yair, sounds awright,” Pat agreed, “but
y’ know the conditions, don’t y’? YTe
not t’ do any top-dressin’, see? I won’t
have any o’ that flamin’ super, put on me
place.” Dan protested, pointing out what
others had done. “Don’t you talk t’ me
about what those goats are doin’ to their
land,” snorted the old-timer indignantly.
“They’re forcin’ it, that’s what they’re
doin’. Forcin’ it t’ perduce more ’n what’s
nacheral. They’ll use it up, see? Then
what are they goin’ t’ do in a few years
when all the good is gorn an’ it won’t
grow anything, eh?”
* * * *
“Horseless Horseman”: Another in-
stance of wanton destruction by the
cockatoo tribe (B. 29/10/ ’47) is that of
the corellas along the mid-Murray. There
on Tammit the blue-eyed, long-billed
birds used to dig up roots on the flats
around sunrise and sunset, and the rest
of the day was spent''on particular trees ;
but, as a flock, the cockies amused them-
selves stripping off the bark, leaves and
twigs until, almost always, the centuries-
old redgums would be killed. Next
season the feathered vandals would pick
other gums as roosts.
* * * *
“Macnell”: One of the anomalies dis-
covered by Admiral Byrd that the
R.A.N.’s Antarctic expedition sailing in
November will check is different depth-
readings for the same spot on the ocean
bottom. At several points Byrd found a
false bottom, where echo-sounders,
checked and re-checked, recorded 10,000
fathoms by day and 2000 at night over
the same place. Various theories were
advanced, among them the presence of
submarine mountains, but the one finally
accepted in the absence of definite proof
was that the sound-waves were reflected
from schools of giant squid foraging from
their mile-deep caves at night. Pro-
fessor Beebe in his bathysphere sighted
an enormous squid half a mile down off
Bermuda, and a group of such monsters
would reflect as convincing an echo as
the ocean floor.
EARTHBOUND.
They are earthbound, and dream—
The seaplane with canvas covers
Over its engines. Memory hovers
Spellbound in seas its hull has once caressed.
Tropic, southern, stormy, and sunshine-blessed.
Strong ropes and concrete blocks its anchor now
Which once in phosphorous furrows drove its
plough.
Earthbound they rest and wait —
The Halifax dreaming there
Of danger in flak and flare,
Journeys ’cross Channel to “the hobs of hell”;
Sisters who disappeared, others who fell
A blazing torch to light the blackened world
Where war raged. Eagles of metal hurled
Who now are still, and dream.
Wingless and wheel-less hulls,
Metal the weather dulls,
Hoping for youth their engines once possessed,
Eager for air against their bodies pressed,
Hungry for power and speed and silver grace
That made them once the proudest of their race;
They lie and wait.
I stand with face to sky
To watch the ’planes go by.
My spirit, free from earthiness, is there
Trampling the clouds to smoke-wraiths in the
air.
Tears sting my eyes with too much beauty found,
An emptiness chills my heart, and I, earthbound,
Stand, too, and dream.

“Flathead”: I am pleased to see that
the nation which launched the flying-
saucer is not resting on its laurels. Its
latest is the tree-climbing sheep. This
phenomenal animal was observed by
one of their theatre critics to be
painted into the backdrop at a
recital by an Australian soprano. He
classified it as: “A flower-decked replica
of an Australian sheep perched with a
fistful of leaves in the fork of a euca-
lyptus-tree.” American farmers wrote in
complaining that their own breeds
couldn’t climb trees, and were told by
the swivel-chaired experts that it was a
common trait among Australian Merinos.
Finally someone in the, Australian News
Bureau did the dirty on the experts and
announced that “Australian sheep do not,
except under great provocation, climb
trees.... It was not a sheep the critic
saw, but a tree-climbing koala.”
* * * *
“Propalong”: The little S.A. township
of Hawker is 400 miles south of the
State’s northern border, but it possesses
the last hospital and doctor on the track
north. Consequently it receives, by car,
truck, train and even by the ’plane of
the Broken Hill flying doctor, a steady
trickle of patients from the half-dozen
or so townships strung along the line to
the north and from the outlying sheep
and cattle stations. These patients, plus
local cases, keep Hawker’s medico living
at the sort of pace medical men always
advise their patients to avoid. But in
addition Dr. Shepherd has also to make
a weekly trip north to Leigh Creek coal-
field, where there is a hostel with nurses
in charge. Between Hawker and Leigh
Creek there are more than 100 miles of
bush track, bridgeless creeks and clay
flats that supply dust-storms in a dry
season and glutinous mud in rain.
Ordinarily the doctor makes his 100-odd
mile trip on a Tuesday morning, prac-
tises at Leigh Creek, returns that after-
noon, calling, if necessary, at the two
townships and several railway camps
along and consults again that
evening in Hawker, with perhaps an hour
or two at the hospital thrown in. In
the event of rain, with watercourses cut
into ditches or choked with boulders and
silt, he gets through as best he can,
wrestling with all the pitfalls a flooded
dirt track can produce. And —yes —
sometimes with a bout of fever, the
legacy of war service, as well.

“Narrin”: Two months ago I killed
what was apparently a large brown snake,
quite normal in all respects save that it
was marked with black rings. Not hav-
ing time for the slow and tedious clean-
ing of the reptile’s skull I threw the corpse
on a meat-ant’s nest and, protecting it
from the crows, left it. A few days ago
an Adelaide herpetologist suggested that,
instead of being a brown, the reptile
might belong to a species similar in ex-
ternal characteristics and previously un-
known in S.A. To settle the point I went
to the ants’ nest to see what sort of job
had been made of the skull. The head,
however, was so thoroughly mummified
that the normal boiling in soapy water
made little impression on the leathery
tissues. So: are meat-ants natural bush
taxidermists or are they just too well fed?
/** * *
“Widgiemooltha”: That yarn of how
Harry weighed his rabbitskins (B.
29/10/’47) recalls the weighing of the
Golden Eagle, Westralia’s biggest nug-
get and to date the last of the big lumps
lifted from Australia’s golden soil.
Larkinville, being only a gold-rush camp,
didn’t possess a set of scales big enough
to weigh the golden mass, so a plank
was laid across a trestle, a 701 b. bag of
sugar on one end, the Eagle on the
other. Of course, you remember that the
gold tipped the balance —the bag of sugar
wasn’t heavy enough.
“Who put the flamin' light out?"
“Jock”: The prize for the most back-
ward physiology student for this month
is shared by Cr. “Salmon Gums” (B.
1 /10/’47) and Or. “Edjudina” (B.
5/11/ ’47) for their theses on “Alcohol —•
its effects on the cooling-system of the
body.” In high external temperatures the
body will sweat only until it has lost as
much water and salt as it can afford, then
evaporation (and cooling) ceases. The
only way to assist cooling is to raise the
intake of water and salt —water without
the salt is useless ; in fact, it will produce
.convulsions known as Stoker’s cramp.
The boys feeding the fires on the coal-
burning ships know this, and drink sea-
water diluted four times —adding half a
teaspoon of common salt to the pint in
the water bag is as good. The ideal
clothing is that which will allow absorp-
tion of sweat and free circulation for
evaporation. Alcohol should be reserved
for the hours after the sun has set.

“Lub”: Dingoes on the hoof aren’t
usually tackled with bare hands, though
I’ve heard of ’em being donged with a
stirrup-iron in a horseback chase. A
party set out from Mitta (Vic.) recently
to survey a new track in from the Omeo
Highway to a prospective ski-ing field
on the edge of Mt. Bogong. In dense
forest and scrub a dingo was sighted
and the horseman gave chase. Honors
went to one of Mitta’s bushbred sons,
who jumped from his horse and grabbed
Warrigal’s tail, applying the quietus by
swinging the critter’s head against a tree.

“Ashton”: Wonder how many warrior
Aboliars can recall the excellent example
of parasitic growth at Semimi, near Buna?
A type of fig, it covered an area of at
least 7000 square feet, and was still going
strong. The centre was a mass of inter-
woven trunks from which serpentine
growths radiated out and gobbled up any
hapless tree in their path. Decaying por-
“Offer them a tin of plum-and-apple, Ponsonby!”
tions of the trunks of victims about sft.
long and up to a foot in diameter were
still suspended in the kangaroo-like grip
of the killer, and several of the empty
loops reared in mid-air like horizontal
nooses. My theory is that a mossy niche
on a branch received the droppings of a
bird with a tummyful of fig-seeds, and
the growth ran down to root in the
ground, strangled the parent tree, and
then set out in search of lebensraum. It
resembled a scene from “Fantasia,” and
at dusk in a drizzling rain was a grue-
some, evil-looking thing.
* * * *
“Salmon Gums”: A fish described as
having two hind legs on which it walks
along the ocean floor has been caught
during trawling operations out from
Shark Bay (W.A.). It sounds rather like
one found after a blow on the nor’-west
coast about four inches long, of
nuggety build, with two front “legs” and
two flippers, like hands, on which it sup-
ported itself as it gazed around with pro-
truding eyes rather like those of the
monkey-fish. That marine monstrosity
hasn’t much of a body, but it has a defi-
nite face, very like a monkey’s. It builds
, a nest of stones in which it sits, with its
face framed in the doorway, apparently
waiting for food to drift along. The fish
found at Shark Bay is being kept alive
and will go to a zoo. The one found
after the blow years ago was pickled in
“square-face” and eventually came into
the possession of a Port Hedland publi-
can, who exhibited it as proof that as
strange things go into a gin-bottle as ever
came out of one.
♦ * * *
“Zake”: Dawkins had put on the fat,
dopey-looking hand from the city and
had given him as his first job the felling
of a bluegum at the top of the river pad-
dock. A few hours later, having heard
no reverberating crash, he went to in-
vestigate, Right around the trunk was
a fair-sized crater in which the new
hand was busy delving with a shovel
among the roots of the still-standing
tree. “What the hell are you doing
there?” roared Dawkins. “You could
have had it felled two hours ago in-
stead of fooling around.” The hand
straightened up painfully. “I ain’t
foolin’ round! ” he; protested. “It’s what
they all do when they’re fellin’ here,
accordin’ to the bloke next door. He
says y’ can never tell which way to run
when she starts to go. This’ll save me
havin’ to make up me mind —all I got
to do is crouch down in the hole. That’s
somethin’ you didn’t tell a man!”
* * * *
“C.E.”: A paddock of mine was all
dug out with the exception of half a
dozen burrows which, after following to a
depth of two or three feet in hard ground,
I trapped and dug in. The paddock was
cleaned up, grass grew over the old
diggings, and for 20 years there hadn’t
been a rabbit in the area. Now, owing to
labor and material shortages, the bunnies
in the last few weeks have made in from
neighboring properties and scattered
quickly. Two burrows I found in the
paddock, and in both cases the rabbits
had dug down over the old holes and
opened them up, providing them-
selves with good, deep homes at a mini-
mum of effort. The earth had been
levelled and showed no sign of ancient
occupation, and being so far below
ground it i§ unlikely that any thumping on
top could detect the small hollow below.
Is this a common practice with rabbits?
* * * *
“Betcha”: Admirers of mother-love
among animals should have seen the
thought displayed by my whippet-cross
for her pups. The youngsters had been
waddling round the yard job, much to
my discomfort and upset; so, collecting
the bunch, I shut them in a high-walled
catching-pen. The old girl climbed to
the top rail, or whinged round outside,
till feed-time. Presently she grew uneasy
as the pups wailed afresh; then, care-
fully selecting an enormous mouthful, she
made for the catching-pen, climbed on a
bag of super., flopped her paws on the
wall and dropped her offering over to the
family. That’s the story. The details
omitted include the enormous feed con-
sumed by the bitch before she remem-
bered the pups, and the fact that the bone
she so carefully selected had been pains-
takingly chewed clean of meat. Further,
she might have shown a bit more care
in delivering that great shin—it donged
one poor little pup on the quince and
knocked him silly.

“Blime”: “I wasn’t too satisfied with
the new rifle I bought,” Trevor’told us.
‘Td ih-ad a few shots an’ got nothin’, so
I drew a black bull on a bit o’ tin, and
had just nailed it up on a tree when
Bob come along. ‘What, ain’t she true?’
he sez t’ me. ‘Here, give us a go at
her. He took it back a good way, sighted,
and let fly. I goes over, an’ there’s a
neat hole clean through the bull. ‘How
many bullets in her?’ Bob sings put.
‘Seven? Well, keep orf, can’t y’, till I
try the thing out?’ Soon’s I slip back,
bang, bang, he goes, sending out the other
six in a stream. I scooted over again,
and hang me if there was a sign of
another hit. ‘Clean missed the target
with them six,’ I told him, as I took
down the tin an’ showed him the first
one in the centre. Bob points to the little
hole in the tree-trunk, gets his knife an’
starts cuttin’ ’em out —yair, seven of ’em
in a tight-packed row they was, end to
end. ‘Yair, I’d say she wus carryin’ pretty
fair,’ sez old Bob, sort o’ lazy like, as
he hands me back me rifle.”

“D.R.H.”: Even the practical-minded
Australian is haunted by a Presence to
which he variously ascribes übiquity,
supernatural quickness, fatal power and
a sinister desire to ambush and annihilate
humanity. This bogey is supposed to be
fast enough to chase a man up a gum-tree,
to render itself invisible with split-second
speed. Scientists say, on the contrary,
that a brown snake is capable of only a
few miles per hour. Naturalists know
the beggar to be most retiring, though
somewhat hysterical, and, compared with
many lizards, almost painfully slow in his
reactions. The average man is not con-
vinced. He meets Brown Blake unex-
pectedly, probably between the snake and
its home. Joe lifts his head, flattens his
neck ribs and throws out warning signals.
The two-legged giant advances. Now
Joseph’s mouth opens widely and he
moves uneasily. Man doesn’t take the
hint. Suddenly the expanded neck ribs
drop, the sinewy neck draws back into a
double curve with the menacing head
held a little to one side. There are two
streaks, one a snake darting forward, the
other a man galloping elsewhere. Then
the man pulls up and dashes after Blake,
who, by this time, is slipping down a
hole 10 yards away. And the man tells
his missus that a snake beat him from
scratch in an even race. The truth is
that the Brown is slow enough, but, being
a small creature, he can be off in top
gear while a large and clumsy human is
creaking into action.

“Old Camp”: Having at one time
spent half a year as a patient in the Woo-
rooloo (W.A.) sanatorium I can endorse
what “Kelms” (B. 29/10/’47) says about
the phthisis-stricken man’s preference
for lemonade. But I fancy that an ardent
desire to keep on living has most to do
with it. For that was the characteristic
most prominent in self and fellow-
sufferers at that time. We were all opti-
mistic of recovery; so when the doc.
almost daily informed us that alcohol
spelt the shortest road to the “nailyard”
there were few who retained any ambi-
tion to touch hard-stuff.
* * * *
“B. A. Ker”: For more than 40 years
old Brown has been the district’s builder
and renovator, his work as square, reli-
able and old-fashionedly honest as his
character. But with Time bending his
back and slowing his feet the old chap
was at last forced to bring young blood
into the business. The alliance lasted
less than a week. As Brown in his quiet
way explained it: “I couldn’t understand
the young fellow at all. I’d given him a
good kit of tools—better than you can
buy now —and showed him how to use
’em. Next day I happen to go round
where he’s workin’, and there he is splittin’
a board with the tommyhawk. ‘You
want to use the rip-saw,’ I told him.
‘The rip-saw! ’ he says, looking disgusted.
‘lt’d break a man’s arm ; I gave it away.’
That annoyed me. ‘Gave it away?’ I
said. ‘That was a first-rate Disston saw.
Who’d you give it to?’ He looked sort
of hard, then grinned kind of silly. ‘I
didn’t give it to nobody,’ he tells me.
T mean I had it yesterday.’ T know you
did, but where is it now?’ I want to
know. ‘Here,’ he says, and brings it out
of his kit. He looks at me a bit queer
as he does it and asks, not exactly cheeky,
‘Wasn’t you bom in Australia?’ I
walked away before I lost my temper.
A while after a lot of swearin’ floats
from around the back; I went round to
see .what’s up. The young bloke is try-
ing to put a window-frame in ; he’s got
the sill in between the studs, but the
head is jamming on the top. ‘You want
to pull your head in,’ I suggested. The
next minute he’s got his coat on and is
demandin’ his money reckons he
wouldn’t let anyone talk to him like that.
I can’t understand it; he must’ve been a
bit mental.”
SONG OF GUNNEDAH.
The wheat is ripe at Gunnedah
And all the land’s astir;
From Breeza up to Barney’s Springs
The hungry headers purr.
From Bective on the quiet Peel
And from the Pilliga
The loaded lorries race the clock
To Gunnedah, to Gunnedah.
There was a time at Gunnedah
When horsemen ruled the land,
And drovers from the Queensland side
Met drovers from the Bland.
They yarned of wonders they had seen
From Gympie to Garah,
And lazily the hours went by
In Gunnedah, in Gunnedah.
But summer now at Gunnedah
Is crowded every hour,
With toil and dust and racing wheels
And engines hot with power.
From Duri up to Boggabri,
From dawn to evening star,
The flood of wheat is pouring in
To Gunnedah, to Gunnedah.
Ay, harvest’s on at Gunnedah ;
On black-soil plain and red,
From Kurrumbede to Dimberoy,
The grain is in the head.
And all along the crowded roads,
From paddocks near and far,
The motors sing their day-long song:
“To Gunnedah, to Gunnedah!”

THE MAN ON
THE LAND
"DON'T WORRY, I'M SENDING IT TO
GRAZCOS."
Culling the Flock.
“Atlanta”; A few weeks before shear-
ing is the best time for it, though where
adequate labor is available the job can
be done as the sheep pass through the
shed. Special ear-pliers should be used
and each culled animal marked in such
a manner as to avoid confusion with
registered ear- and age-marks, while en-
suring that culls can be readily drafted
later. Raddling the noses is purely tem-
porary, as the raddle may be washed out
by rain or obliterated by dust.
Desirable characteristics to be kept in
mind when culling: 1. Good strong heads
without coarseness. Thin faces and
narrow, pinched nostrils denote poor con-
stitution. 2. Good mouth, with even teeth
meeting the pad properly. An undershot
or overshot jaw prevents the sheep from
feeding properly. Runty, undersized
specimens are often the result of mouth
defects. 3. Big frame and well-shaped,
deep body. 4. Wide at shoulders and
slightly arched over the wither. A peaked
wither is usually associated with a narrow
chest and weak constitution. 5. Good
topline, back level and rump rounded and
not drooping. Cull all sheep with devil’s
grip (a depression in the ribs behind the
shoulders, often noticeable in unshorn
sheep as a greasy discoloration in the
wool), or malformation at shoulders.
Some Merino types show predisposition
to back weaknesses, particularly if rams
and the hock in general are not kept
at a consistently high standard. 6. Good
underline, deep in front and deep in the
flank. 7. Front legs straight and set wide
apart, hind legs wide at the hocks. Avoid
sheep which brush at the hocks or have
hocks which curve inwards. Sheep light
in bone or with bad feet or long weak
pasterns should also be culled.
Watch the degree of development or
wrinkliness in the sheep. Wrinkly-
crutched sheep fall to fly strike. Heavy
wool-growth on young rams will often
disguise body wrinkles, but the alert
sheepman can discover the fault by thrust-
ing his fingers into the wool along the
ribs, rump or elsewhere, and exploring
the skin with his fingertips.
Covering must be considered from the
points of quantity and quality, with em-
phasis on quantity. Weight of fleece is
essential and is obtained from size of
sheep and length and density of the
fleece. The ideal is to obtain good length
of staple, combined with good density
and quality, remembering always that re-
turn per head is of greater importance
than price per pound.
Commonest wool faults are lack of den-
sity, lack of bulk or body, lack of length,
crimp or character (shown as plainness),
harshness in handle of the .wool, bad
color, unevenness in covering, and the
presence of hair or kemp.
Testing D.D.T. Dips.
“Outback”: The need for a quick,
accurate method of testing has been felt
ever since dips were charged with D.D.T.,
the only known method being a compli-
cated procedure. The agricultural chemist
of Queensland Department of Agricul-
ture, Dr. Montgomery White, states that
it impossible to obtain an almost be-
“Well, you said trim short back and front!”
wildering diversity of results from the
one cattle dip charged with D.D.T. un-
less a very rigid set of conditions is fol-
lowed.
The difficulty is not confined to dips.
It applies to orchard sprays ; storage of
specimens under different climatic condi-
tions and in varying concentrations of
different reactants calls for ingenuity and
experience that can come only from years
of endeavor. The position must obviously
become increasingly complicated as more
and more of the old standing pest-
destroyers are replaced by modern selec-
tive poisons. It is possible, as Dr. White
points out, to examine dips by the score
daily when arsenic alone is the active
ingredient, but only a small fraction of
this is possible, even in the laboratory,
with D.D.T. and gammexane.
In West Australia.
“Milton”: Of all the wheat States
W.A. is unique in its land variation, the
demarcation line between good and in-
ferior country being often but a few
yards, and the variation occurring in
some districts several times in a few
miles. One of the results was that while
the price of wheat remained normal,
much of the second- and third-class land,
chiefly sandy stuff growing scrub and
low timber, was not brought into pro-
duction, thus retaining ideal conditions
for prevention of wind erosion.
But the supply of Crown wheat land
in safe-rainfall areas having become ex-
hausted except hundreds of farms
abandoned in pre-war days, the majority
Containing too small an area of first-class
land in the regulation 1000-acre block —
some vacant scrub country was offered
by the past Labor Government to land-
seekers, irrespective of whether the whole
or portion of it would not be a greater
asset if left as windbreaks and thus pre-
vent the inevitable dust bowl that fol-
lows intensive cultivation and destruc-
tion of scrub cover.
These alleged living areas make no
provision for the resting of about a
quarter of the farm from agriculture or
grazing; the land is claimed to be too
precious for that, though that is exactly
the reason why it should not be blown
away or flogged out.
High prices for wheat and sheep will
bring much sand-plain and scrub country
into use, and where no windbreaks are
present pasture-growing will not prevent
drift, as the rainless summer months and
stock-pounded surface give no stability.
The erosion rot seems to be always
left for the other fellow, and hang pos-
terity is the general attitude. The Gov-
ernments have been scared by their
bungling of land matters, so little is done
except a bit of contour ploughing here
and there, a lot of fuss about so-called
“experimental stations” and periodic ex-
pressions of concern by party leaders just
before elections. Meantime, the soil is
being steadily eaten away.
Split Palings.
“E.H.S.”: The best and most durable
are split from sound, straight-grained
trees, most suitable being messmate,
mpuntain ash, blackbutt, peppermint,
stringybark and turpentine, any of which
can be worked into the required dimen-
sions with a very small percentage of
waste. Having selected a suitable tree,
the splitter fells and saws it into the re-
quired lengths; each length is then split
into quarters and broken up into con-
venient billets about 6in, by 6in., or
wider if broad palings are required.
Two methods are employed in break-
ing up the quarters: “backing off” along
the cleavage of the annular rings and
“quartering” across or at right-angles to
the rings. A billet is placed with its butt
against the foot of the stump, and over
a large chock of wood in such a posi-
tion that the upper end is waist-high to
the splitter. The paling knife is then
placed in a horizontal position across the
end of the billet and driven in with a
mallet, allowing £in. or -fin. for the thick-
ness of the paling, which is then run off
the billet by a slight leverage on the
handle of the knife.
All the above timbers split more evenly
and with much less waste when worked
on the quarter than when the backing
method is used. The palings should be
stacked with each course at right-angles
to the preceding one and left until suffi-
ciently seasoned to prevent warping.
Shingles are split from the same class of
timber and in the same way as palings.
Superphosphate.
“Mr.”: If applied in spring super, will
produce a marked response in a pasture,
but as paddock feed then is usually
abundant there is no point in overpro-
ducing unless the excess growth is re-
quired for some special purpose. Greater
value from the same quantity of super,
will be gained if it is applied early in
the new year. The increased growth in
autumn and winter resulting from this
application will come at a time when
feed is usually scarce.
Under Victorian conditions super, is
the most economic fertiliser for the cor-
rection of phosphate and calcium defi-
ciencies. The quantities depend on

A NEW DEVELOPMENT
Spreader Firing, combined
with a Forward Moving Grate
0 1 OCff 4 >
® St
The introduction of the Forward
Moving Grate, discharging ash
continuously, has widened the scope
of Spreader Firing because:
1. Combustion conditions are not
disturbed by intermittent ash re-
moval.
2. There is no clinker formation,
even with ash having very low
fusion temperature, as the bulk of
the air required for combustion
passes through and cools the ash
layer, thereby avoiding harmful
deposits on the pressure parts.
3. Automatic control is simply
applied.
4. High burning rates are readily
attained, as the fuel and the air are
evenly distributed over every square
foot of grate area.

several factors, of which rainfall is the
most important. In a 25in. to 30in. rain-
fall zone 2cwt. per acre is about the
upper economic limit, but in higher-rain-
fall areas or where rainfall is supple-
mented by irrigation, up to 4cwt. per acre
can be used. Whatever quantity is used
regularity of application is essential.
Trials conducted by Victorian Depart-
ment of Agriculture show that about 60
p.c. of the phosphate in super, is taken
up by the plants, 40 p.c. remaining in the
soil in a form slowly available to the
pasture. If topdressing is suddenly dis-
continued after years of regular appli-
cations growth at first doesn’t appear to
be unduly affected, but as the reserves
of fertiliser in the soil become depleted
the falling away of the pasture, accom-
panied by an increase in the number of
undesirable weeds, becomes obvious,
A Wool Review.
“R.N.”; Dalgety’s call their 49th
“Annual Wool Review” one for Australia
and New Zealand, but it is more than
that, since it gives a pretty comprehensive
outline of the wool, textile, cotton and
even mohair industries throughout the
world. It seems to have got an eye to a
crack in the “iron curtain,” since it re-
marks that Russia probably lost more
than 27,000,000 sheep during the war.
Strenuous efforts have since been made
to rebuild the depleted flocks, and a new
five-year plan has been formulated which
envisages a considerable increase in the
size of flocks and a higher proportion of
sheep on collective farms.... It is proposed
that by the end of the period the annual
wool dips per sheep will be raised 30 p.c.
A target of 470 million lb. (greasy) has
been set [presumably per year] the
Soviet would then be practically indepen-
dent of foreign supplies.
Dalgety’s Review looks into the posi-
tion of wool at home and abroad, gives a
resume of 1946-47 prices, with asides on
quality, labor, rabbits, weeds and other
things. It ought to be in the hands of
everybody interested in wool.
Citrus in Dry Areas.
“B. Acre”: That advice (B. 8/10/’47)
about growing citrus successfully on
4gal. of water a week needs qualifica-
tion and correction. The quantity of
water, spread over a 10ft. square, would
be 6in. for six months, which is very
small compared with basic irrigation re-
quirements of 12in., plus rainfall. To
grow citrus on 4gal. of water a week a
clay subsoil would be needed or the water
would soak away, leaving the soil dry
much of the, time ; and a regular summer
rainfall of about lOin. would make it
easier.
There is a large area of western N.S.W.
with neither of these. As citrus feeds
mainly from the top 18in. of soil, the
regular weekly watering is a good idea.
For the same reason, don’t dig too deeply
under citrus or you destroy much of its
feeding area. If deep digging is neces-
sary, do it early so the summer root
growth can replace the roots cut. Other-
wise, stir only 2in. of top soil and cover
with a litter mulch.
An orchard growing in a dry Lachlan
district, with an irregular annual rain-
fall of under 15in. average, is situated on
a hillside and drains are cut so that the
run-off from several hundred acres can
be brought to the orchard. Each tree is
set in a basin about Ift. deep. That is
an example worth following. Lay out
the garden with a slope above it to col-
lect the drainage from a road or track, if
possible, and build it to hold water. . I
used this method with vegetables for
several years, at one time using the water
from a roof 40ft. square and the drain-
age from a quarter-acre houseyard. The
rule was to go out in the rain and see
that the best possible use was made of
all available water.
Hints for the Farm.
“Sundowner”: When loading pigs for
market separate backfatters and choppers
from baconers and smaller pigs and pre-
vent them from fighting. Don’t feed the
pigs before loading, for they may be sick
in transit and buyers are not influenced
by fullness of bellies. Buyers of live pigs
over scales make allowance for full
stomachs.
“W.T.U.”: On matter of headaches re-
sulting from use of gelignite (B.
29/10/’47), these are commonly caused
by rubbing the hands across the forehead
after handling the explosive. If care is
taken not to place the hands near the
head before washing them it is very rarely
that headache will follow the use of gelig-
nite in the open air.
“Myrr”: D.D.T. alone isn’t fully effec-
tive against the grey cabbage aphis,
troublesome in Victoria this year. The
Vic. Department of Agriculture recom-
mends a dust containing both D.D.T. and
gammexane. This dust is effective also
against caterpillars of the cabbage moth
and cabbage butterfly, and can be used in
place of lead arsenate-nicotine dust. For
rose aphis use soap-suds. If the infesta-
tion is heavy add a teaspoon of nicotine
sulphate to the gallon. The yellow cotton
aphis can be settled with a gammexane
15 emulsion spray, one in 150.
“Mr.”: W. D. Andrew, Vic. pasture
expert, recommends heavy grazing of
paspalum in early summer in his State.
Coupled with topdressing, this will keep
it in a short, leafy condition. Permitted
to become tall and rank, its fodder value
deteriorates. Cutting and fertilising will
also encourage the growth of clovers.
Topdressing is necessary when the seed-
heads show a sticky exudate, a sure sign
of ergot, which can cause serious stock
losses.
“Sarina”: Though there may be an
opening in the fence of a grazing paddock
through which horses may move out to
water, it often happens that young horses
haven’t sense enough to go out by the
way they came in. Instead, they make
for a corner of the paddock nearest the
water and stay there until they perish.
Be on the watch to prevent this.
“Gip”: At the first sign of egg-eating
among fowls, keep a close watch and
catch the offending bird. If you don’t
want to kill it, cut off the tip of its beak
with a pair of scissors and place it in
a coop by itself. Egg-eating is usually
caused by lime deficiency in the fowl’s
diet, and .will rarely occur when there is
plenty of shell-grit available. Eggs are
accidentally broken in the first place,
then on purpose—a habit other fowls
soon learn.

Method of eradicating fleas from an earth-
floored shed ?
Try fumigation by burning sulphur in the
proportion of, 41b. to each 100-cubic-foot
capacity of the shed. Place sulphur in a metal
receptacle supported on bricks in a tub con-
taining a little water (to avoid the risk of fire);
sprinkle the surface of the sulphur with methy-
lated spirits to facilitate burning. Seal up all
openings, ventilators, etc., and leave the room
under fumigation for at least eight hours.

Cause of and how to check vegetable plants
from running to seed?
Seedlings neglected in the early stages or left
too long in seed-boxes will often run quickly
to seed when planted in open beds of rich soil.
After planting, any check in growth through
lack of water or adverse weather conditions
will also cause early seed-stalks. When soil-
beds are made slightly richer than the seed-
beds the bolting rarely occurs, although it must
be remembered that seed-formation is the
natural habit of plant life. Seed from the
“bolters” should not be kept for future needs,

of a column that was making its way
towards the door.
“Snails!” said Mr. Noyse with some
heat. “Where the hell did these come
from?”
“They must have got out of the box,”
said Tony.
“What box?” asked his father as Mrs.
Noyse came in to investigate.
“Rossie’s box.” «
“What the hell has Rossie got to do
with it?”
David was awake by this and offered
an explanation.
“Rossie gave them to Tony when he
didn’t get any coming-out-early marks
for them.”
Mrs. Noyse’s interest was aroused by
this. She had been a little intrigued by
th f 'dea of the coming-out-early marks.
he get any. she asked.
The tortoise isn t there any more. It
On such small events success
or failure of big business propositions
depend. Mrs. Noyse was prepared to
reflect awhile on the collapse of Ross’s
plans, but her husband’s mind was more
on affairs of the moment.
“But what are the snails doing in
here?” he asked.
David was patient.
“Well, you see,” he said, “When Rossie
didn’t get any coming-out-early marks
he”
“I don’t want to hear about Ross,”
interrupted his father. “What are they
doing in here?”
“Tony took the box to bed with him.”
It was Tony’s invariable habit to take
something to bed with him. If he could
get away with it, he preferred something
big, but as he was usually relieved of
anything bulky, he generally had to fall
back on articles that were easily con-
cealed. With a tram-ticket, a piece of
string or a leaf off the pear-tree clutched
in his chubby hand, he would sleep in
complete content.
At the moment he was sitting hunched
up in bed, looking shame-faced and
apprehensive. Mr. Noyse decided to
waste no more time on inquiries, but to
clean up the mess and get back to bed..
“Come on,” he said to his wife. “Giye
us a hand with these blasted things. You,
too, David.”
David shuddered.
“I don’t want to get warts,” he whim-
pered.
“What?”
Mrs. Noyse explained. “He really
believes it,” she concluded, “Don’t make
him help.”
Between them Mr. and Mrs. Noyse
collected every snail they could find and
put them back in the cardboard-box. Mr.
Noyse went to the window and threw
box and contents out into the night.
There was a wail from Tony.
“You frew away my snails. They’ll
all run away now.”
“The further the better,” said his
callous father.
As the couple walked back to their
room they heard David’s voice. “Tony,
did any of those snails really crawl on
you?”
“Yes, all of them,” exaggerated Tony.
“Well, you’ll have warts all over you.
Wherever the snails crawled you’ll have
a wart.”
Tony burst out howling afresh. His
mother went back to calm the storm.
“Don’t talk such nonsense, David,” she
said. “And don’t you take any notice of
him, Tony.”
“Will I weally have warts all over me,
Mummy?”
“Of course not.”
She put out the light again and went
to her room. In the darkness she could
hear faintly the voice of the tormentor.
“You will so, though. You just wait
and see.” .
THE thud of the morning paper on the
front verandah was usually a signal to
Mr. Noyse that he could turn over for
another five minutes’ sleep, but next
morning as he heard its crash he was at
the same time aware of two small figures
alongside his bed.
“Daddy,” whispered David,
“Uh.”
“You know you and Mummy said that
snails don’t give people warts.”
“Yes.” ‘ \
“Well, I’ve looked at Tony all over
and I’ve found one.”
“What?”
“A wart.”
“Don’t talk rot.”
“But it’s true. Look!”
Against his better judgment Mr. Noyse
peered at the small finger stuck out to-
wards him. He rubbed it. Sure enough
it was a wart. Tiny, almost microscopic,
but still a wart. Mrs. Noyse examined
it, too, and had to admit the truth of
the diagnosis.
“Will I die?” asked Tony in tones
that showed he was prepared fpr the
worst. Mrs. Noyse reassured him’, and
then addressed herself to David,
“It’s a wart all right,” she told him.
“But the snails had nothing to do with
it.”
“But it wasn’t there last night, was it,
Tony?”
Tony was prepared to swear to this.
“It must have been there,” said his
mother. “It’s just that we didn’t notice
it.”
“Well, Tony would have noticed it. On
his own finger.”
Mrs. Noyse realised that she was
fighting a losing battle, but she stuck to
her guns. “It must have been there,” she
said. “Now go and get dressed.”
The boys went out of the room. As
they went down the passage she could
hear David’s voice: “By lunch-time you’ll
probably have them all over your face.
You see if you don’t.”

“Because choice varieties are now unavail-
able at the Sydney Government’s markets, fash
is being imported from New Zealand.”
Jack, the Newcastle Wizard, Chief
Commissar of the State Sovietised Fish-
ing Industry, pondered with intense self-
satisfaction his latest masterstroke—his
two, in fact.
Only that day he had obtained a bril-
liant acquisition to his Gestapo staff, and
he had negotiated a brilliant New Zea-
land deal.
Probably no man with sounder quah-
fications for the task of snooping could
have been found in Australia than the
ex-organiser of the Dolls’ Eye Polishers’
Union. That he couldn’t tell a groper
from a squid assured the industry that
he would bring to his task an open mind
uncluttered with technicalities. The fact,
however, that his niece had once been
taken to the pictures by a fish-gutter at
the markets had given him a deep psycho-
logical insight into the industry’s special
problems.
The qualifications which had really
clinched his appointment, however, had
been his use of two aliases as a member
of the Communist party, and his war
effort of getting his union to strike 20
times between September, 1939, and June,
1941, in protest against failure to negoti-
ate a peace with Hitler,
The New Zealand deal was a tribute to
Jack’s wonderful business sense, particu-
larly as it followed the good turn already
done to Australia by the fellow-“ Labor”
Government across the Tasman in taking
off our hands 18,000,000 bushels of wheat
at the splendid price of ss. 9d. when
world-parity price was only 16s. (now
a measly pound). But the New Zealand
Government had generously agreed to
let Jack have fish for only Is. a pound
above the home-market price. It was
gestures such as this which fostered inter-
national goodwill.
The deal had greatly strengthened the
young Sovietised industry. How different
was this planned economy from the bad
old days when trawlers came in choked
with fish which housewives bought from
6d. to 9d. a pound; and out of which
the Government got practically nothing!
Now the industry was keeping in employ-
ment hundreds of inspectors and office
staff, and workers could now queue up
for some of last week’s fish if available
and get it for as little as 2s. 9d. a pound.
Two months after his appointment,
and just as he had almost mastered the
distinguishing between a snapper and a
flying gurnard, the ex-organiser of the
D.E.P.U. was allotted his first task.
Some fishermen down at Bateman’s Bay
had, it was suspected, loaded their catch
of bream on to a lorry for private sale.
Immediately the investigator set off in
his official limousine. At Bateman’s Bay
he deduced that they might head either
south for Melbourne or north for Sydney,
so he made west over the Clyde Moun-
tain, through Oberon to Canberra, hop-
ing to cut them off. While in Canberra
he got, through the usual diplomatic
channels, his orders from the Cominform
that he knew would be awaiting him,
then raced for Albury, where he thought
the quarry might be heading. By a
strange coincidence his brother happened
to live there. After staying overnight
he decided that it was likely the Fascist
miscreants who had dared to try to sell
their own fish where they liked might
make for Newcastle. Two days later he
arrived there, compensating his failure
to come upon the fleeing fishvendors by
backing a dog which he had heard a week
ago would be “going” that day.
Back in Sydney, he put in his “chit”
for the £5O out-of-pocket expenses for
the week, got another 150 petrol tickets
and set off for Hay to inspect two cases
of fiathead—the whole of the week’s
catch—that had been sent by slow goods
train and had been shunted on to a siding
by some mistake. It was 102 in the
shade when he got there, and when he
lifted the lid of one case a smell redolent
of a Dan Mulcahy speech against Digger
p.-0.-w. enveloped him. When the sal
volatile got him on his feet again he
reconsigned the fish to Sydney pending
an official decision as to its ultimate dis-
posal, and followed, via Newcastle, where
another important dog meeting was be-
ing held.
The next day Jack got a letter which
evoked in him an even greater self-
latisfaction than his two masterstrokes.
It was from an orchardist expressing
appreciation of the gift of 14 cases of
overripe fish which he had ploughed in
as a fertiliser. That week’s catch, he re-
membered, had gone bad while an official
was making up his mind what to do with
it. It was a splendid thing to think that
the important fruit industry benefited.
This was true socialised co-operation.
As the Chief Commissar leaned back
in a pleasant state of dreamy wonder-
ment as to whether the next lot of rotten
fish would go to grow bigger apples or
oranges, the ex-organiser of the D.E.P.U.
came in.
“I’ve inspected them ’undred an’ fifty
cases o’ fish that come from New Zea-
land yestiddy,” he announced. “I ordered
the lot to be dumped. Why, not one o’
them fish goes more than two inches
long! That’s less than the smallest size
allowed by regulation to be ’ooked or
netted.”
Jack bent on his subordinate a look
of mild reproach. “You’d better exer-
cise slightly more care in future, Joe,”
he said. “That was a consignment of
whitebait.”
The other looked amazed. “Importin’
bait!” he exclaimed. “Why, ain’t we
got enough mullet-gut an’ prawns of our
own we could use?”

THE OTHER FELLOW'S MIND

Why They Leave
Over 36,000 Queensland voters have
left the country for the town between the
last two State elections. Curiously, the
reason is the current high selling prices
of primary products—the place to reap
the benefit of those prices is not in the
country but in the city.
When a sudden rise in wool pricesi
occurs the grower may show a good
profit for one or two years, but often,
before the second year is out, the Arbi-
tration Court and other authorities have
given all the new profits to the towns-
people by increasing the wages of
shearers, shedhands, cooks, carriers, rail-
waymen, wharfies, dumpers, strikers,
carters, seamen and tally clerks. And,
as though that weren’t enough, everyone
except the farmer and grazier gets a 40-
hour week.
Then there are other matters, such as
another ss. per hundred for the shearers
for cutting the wool off an extra inch of
sheep’s tails; higher railway freightage
on scoured wool than greasy in an effort
to get the scours to the city; fines to
be paid for all station help and 12s. for
wharfies when they visit the wharf and
are not wanted. In loading wool, although
two bales dumped together are easier to
roll than single-dumped bales, wharfies
insist on rolling the more difficult parcel.
So ships take much longer to turn round.
It would almost seem that these imposts
are part of a planned campaign to dis-
courage the “profit motive” in those
people who must have not* only profit but
a substantial one, as without reserves
sooner or later the erratic Australian
climate turns them to wage-earners in-
stead of farmer-graziers.
Just before the war the Queensland
State Government, alarmed by the drift
of farmers to the city, advised local
authorities that plenty of money would
be available on loan for building of
amenities in rural areas. But real
workers, both employers and employees,
want more than swimming baths and
septic tanks.
About the same time the Federal Gov-
ernment voted £12,000,000 to rehabilitate
people on the land. The fund was ad-
ministered by the Rural Bank, but the
main feature of the scheme was that
unless the applicant for help was so un-
successful or incompetent that his banker
was glad to write off a big slice of in-
debtedness the money was not available.
The net result of that was to encourage
the least valuable landholder to continue
on his thriftless course.
There is only one way in which to
keep the farmer on his farm —allow him
to make a handsome profit and allow
him to keep it. It is going to be much
harder to get people interested in the
land than to hold those that are there
from selling out. — Hadley Propsting
The Cleric's Pay
“R.W.” (B. 8/10/’47) overlooked the
fact that it was “Columba” (B. 3/9/’47)
and not the parson who protested.
Apparently the clergyman counted the
cost and tried to make a go of things in
a difficult parish, but finding it impossible
to carry on resigned. “R.W.” knows very
little about churches, or, if he does, he
is one of those who pray “O Lord keep
the minister humble and we will keep him
poor.”
Look at the homes of the clergy. Few
are modern, and many are not even kept
m good order. The average rent for these
homes is between £5O and £BO a year.
Parochial councils, of course, do not
pay for light and gas and no one expects
them to, but many do not even pay for
telephone calls. Some pay the telephone
rental. Is there any business in which
the staff pays for business calls?
If a clergyman felt that he partook of
a meal as a “free meal” his pride would
compel him to carry his lunch wherever
ne went. It is strange to read that even
°? e iter brands the hospitality of the
cnurchfolk thus and yet, perhaps, it ex-
plains the view of “R.W.” that ministers
a t re ® n J lc hed by gifts of food. He has not
studied the pantries of many clerics. In
tne past the gifts which were noticeable
were of oats, chaff and hay. With the
advent of the motor-car these have ceased
it is not as easy to put petrol into a car
as chaff into a sulky.
As to the i tidy sum the clergyman
receives from births, deaths and
marriages, a little thought will explode
]For instance > w hat would
R-W,” be worth to the church over, say,
60 years? Ten shillings at his christening,
£3 at his marriage, 10s. at the christening
of each child and £1 for the burial of
himself and his wife. Say £lO in 60 years.
Stipends are not often increased, and
taxation has increased to an extent that it
leaves most clergymen at least on the
same footing as 25 years ago. I suppose
‘R.W,” holds that the clergy should have
counted the cost and not complain.—
Biridja (N.S.W.).
“A Clear Majority”
Some indication of the apathy with
which the average N.T. unionist regards
his union may be gauged from the fact
that at the adjourned annual meeting of
the one big union, held in Darwin, the
secretary mourned the fact that out of
more than 1400 ballot-papers forwarded
to members only 262 were returned to
the union office. Of these, 69 were in-
formal.
So six unionists out of every seven con-
sidered * the ballot of no importance!
And this is the union that loudly an-
nounces itself as a 100-per-cent, show,
and which has bluffed so successfully that
Government departments are in a blue
funk about it. Of course it hailed the
result of its ballot as a “dear-majority”
vote. Are other union majorities obtained
in the same ratio?—' Wingella (N.T.).
Senate and New States
In the Victorian election Labor in that
State was punished for loyalty to the
Sydney-dominated Federal Labor party.
Truly, as The Bulletin illustrated, Mr.
Cain went to the election chained by the
legs to Mr. Chifley’s bank grab and un-
fair, unfederal treatment of his State
under the Grants Act section of the
Uniform Income Tax legislation.
Still, the Victorian Senators will nega-
tive one of the principal duties of the
Senate and support Mr. Chifley’s bank-
ing legislation. The prevalence of party
hacks in the Senate destroys its intended
function as a protective chamber for the
nation and the States, and the reason for
equal numbers for each State is de-
feated.
A widely elected and interested Aus-
tralian commission is urgently needed:
(1) To divide Australia regionally into
many more States, each to look after its
own domestic and local-government
affairs and financial stability. The new
governing bodies would have to be some-
thing between our present cumbersome
State Governments and our municipal
councils. The big capital cities must
have their own Government and cease to
dominate other areas. From a country
point of view there is no N. S. Wales State
Government and soon it will be the same
in the other States. (2) To hand over to
the Federal Government all that is reason-
ably controllable by it. (3) To arrange all
finances justly and suitably. (4) To
establish a more suitable Federal Upper
House, not too large and with restricted
party interference.—!. T. T. (Vic.).
A National Dramatic School
These days it’s no sin to have an actress
in the family because, in Australia at any
rate, she needs to be a woman of great
foresight and integrity, beautiful, not
particularly talented, but above all rich.
"Don't just lie there moaning—arch your back and it will roll of."
Acting is fast becoming a luxury that only
the rich can afford.
Here is a mean average of fees.
Dramatic schools and academies charge
from £5 to £8 for a term of 10 weeks
containing two evening lectures a week.
These include diction, Shakspeare, Shak-
speare, more Shakspeare, Gr-e-e-e-k
Tragedy and Rupert Brooke for the first
s rT” c you’re lucky, you
g^ ea % U L and The Com Is Green
to study and the rudiments of fencing,
mass-murder of ballet and how to blow
2* f ying “° owhat ” Real
ballet lessons from a competent person
cost about £2 a term of 10 lessons for
class and more for private instruction—
one needs a lesson a day, class or private,
to keep in any shape.
Singing and music teachers charge their
own sweet wild charges, added to which
are the constant expenses of broken
strings and new music. Photographs are
an essential, and you don’t get a studio
portrait for two-bob.
Clothes are important and you need
pretty good wages to get what you need,
but you can’t have a job if you’re trying
to get on the stage—you may be called
U P t 0 P° bsh the se at outside a casting
othce for any number of hours at any
old time. As for modelling, once again
you need clothes, and expensive make-up
and any number of doodads, plus a

The Government should stop chatter-
ing about a “national theatre” and set
up a national dramatic academy, free and
available to all. It should be a true school
of the people— not bearing “Art is a
weapon” above its portal, as the New
Theatre League does —with an honor roll
of Australian theatrical names to answer
anyone who questions our right and
ability to act.
Can’t some of the thumping entertain-
ment tax be used to ensure that Austra-
lians will some day get entertainment?—
Cherub 103 (N.S.W.).
Education
Is mental arithmetic becoming a lost
subject in our schools?
Doing my shopping I notice that lads
and lasses behind counters have great
difficulty in tallying the cost of small
items I usually have to check over to
see they’re not out one way or the other.
Some time ago I was supervising a
public-service exam, for entrance to the
postal department. Forty-two boys sat
for it, and only a small number did a
satisfactory paper in simple arithmetic.
The placing of well-known towns in their
respective States also had many of them
beaten, one lad telling me afterwards that
he’d set Ballarat and Ararat in Queens-
land because they looked like aboriginal
names!
Asked to draw a rough outline map of
Victoria, filling in the principal towns,
some of the group gazed round the walls
and asked “Where are the maps? We’ve
only been used to tracing maps at
school! ”
Surely arithmetic, geography and his-
tory are three of the things that go with
reading and writing as essentials. Per-
haps one shouldn’t blame the teachers —a
curriculum overcrowded with trimmings
is responsible.— O’Johnno (Tas.).
Melbourne’s Housing Muddle
I like to see old traditions maintained.
I was delighted when I read that Lord
Mayor Connelly, of Melbourne, and
Town Clerk Wootton had solemnly gone
on a “circuit of perambulation” and
“beaten” the “medes and bounds” of the
city. Under an Act of 1842, if the Lord
Mayor had neglected this duty he would
have been subject to a fine of £2O, £lO
going to the informer.
I don’t feel quite so jolly when I con-
template present-day conditions in the city
and the insane way in which they are
being tackled by councils, commissions,
committees and Government departments,
dozens of them, all fighting one another.
I suppose Barry, till lately No-Housing
Minister, cannot now be blamed.
Houses, prefabs and jerry-built modern
dwellings, are being dumped down in
every empty paddock, regardless of future
questions of development and expansion.
Areas are being subdivided 20 miles from
the centre of the city and materials, if
any, are being hauled there at enormous
expense and terrific labor, while the com-
munity is being loaded with a colossal
debt in servicing these isolated units with
electricity, gas, sewerage and water. In
many places there isn’t sufficient of any
of those commodities to go round. In
my district dozens of poultryfarmers and
market-gardeners are threatened with a
water famine in the summer because fresh
houses are being connected to mains
which are already inadequate to serve the
existing population. An enormous waste
of labor and material is being expended
in making roads to these settlements in
Melbourne’s Never Never, and tenants
will not only have to spend a lot of time
in travelling to and from their business,
but pay the increased fares imposed by
the Railway Department.
Yet, while all this fury of alleged de-
velopment is going on within a three-mile
radius of the G.P.0., according to J.
O’Keefe, executive director of the Build-
ing Industry Congress, there are sufficient
vacant spaces to rehouse every slum-
dweller and houseless individual in the
city, and to provide them with all neces-
sary services, parks and children’s play-
grounds. Gas, electric light, water and
sewerage services could be connected to
the houses immediately, medical, dental
and social amenities are handy, and so
even are cinemas and trotting courses.
There would be no increased transport
costs to the new suburbs and no addi-
tional cost to the community, rather a
big reduction. The areas involved would
be brought into use instead of being left
the happy-hunting grounds Of two-up
schools and illegal dog-racing on Sundays.
In short, our bureaucrats are not solv-
ing any problem but creating a fresh one
—and a beauty—for future generations.—
Bumpkin (Vic.),
Journalism
Not being one of the intelligentsia I’ve
often been puzzled by scathing references
to “Yankee journalism,” the “moronic
press” and other jibes at contemporary
newspapers. Enlightenment has come
after reading “Fact,” a Sydney “Sunday
Sun” supplement, in which I was treated
to the following;
A member of the British Expeditionary
Force wrote of waiting on the beaches at
La Panne, in the Dunkirk evacuation:
“A terrific air attack developed. Immedi-
ately a soldier began to play ‘Abide with
Me.’ Every man stood still and sang.
Never have I heard such a choir.”
And never again will he hear such a
choir. The instinctive reaction under air
attack is to dive for cover, or flop down
flat. I know, for I’ve made many such
a dive and many such a flop, even when
there was no cover. No, I was not at
Dunkirk, and even if I had been not one-
tenth of my mates would have known the
words of “Abide with Me,” despite the
undoubted glory of that noble hymn.
Anyway, becoming critical for the first
time, I read on to two columns of drivel
about the funeral obsequies of the Ameri-
can racehorse, Man o’ War, referred to
as “the deceased.” It was reported that
thousands of mourners shed copious tears
as, “dignified in death, the mighty stallion
lay on its left side against a huge white,
satin-covered pillow.” Again, “From
early morning a cavalcade of quietly-
sobbing stablehands trudged up the dusty
dirt road to Faraway stud farm.” Man
o’ War was a mighty horse, but they cer-
tainly breed the stablehands tougher in
Australia.
However, there was a classic touch to
the final paragraph of this holocaust of
horse sorrow. It, too, merits embalm-
ment :
Man o’ War left 386 mares whom he
served faithfully and well over a number
of years.
—Joe Cowra (N.S.W.).
Seeking fresh fields on which to inflict
my freelance outpourings, I analysed
some of the more popular weeklies. I
was disappointed to find that apart from
The Bulletin and “The Australian
Woman’s Mirror” there is little scope
among the more-widely-read periodicals
for Australian writing.
A flapper weekly that boasts a circula-
tion of 700,000 turns out 40 pages. In
the copy I have before me they are taken
up as follows: Advertisements, pages ;
Hollywood (syndicated), four; astrology
and Yank magician, one ; society, one ;
culls from other papers, one; “features”
from “Our London or New York Office ”
six; fashion, one; cookery (mostly
illustrations), two; “staff reporters’ ”
articles, one (one well-informed staff re-
porter recently made Senator Ashley the
P.M.G.); land syndicated stories from
American agencies, up to seven pages
That accounts for 39 pages. The cover
makes the 40th. Six American car-
toons complete the issue. Two of the
“staff articles” have an Australian flavor
and the rest of the magazine is pure un-
adulterated Yank. — Video (Q.).


The New Jargon
In Parliamentary or trade-union debate
we have a new jargon. A worker who
is disciplined is “crucified,” a just verdict
is a “vicious sentence,” a man who is
employed is “exploited” as a “wage slave
by a “soulless plutocrat” and an employer
is a “capitalist” or “vampire” who
“battens” on the “blood and sweat of
the masses and “starves them into sub-
mission.”
Then the basic wage, designed to
ensure a certain standard of comfort for
a man, wife and family—and in practice
extended to wifeless and childless workers
alike —is “the lowest possible sum on
which a worker can exist.” Any indi-
vidual who holds a different opinion from
the mob is a “Judas,” a “Fascist,” an
“imperialist” and a “reactionary.” No
political orator can neglect to “explore
every avenue” or to “leave any stone un-
turned” whether he is talking about a
street culvert or a “long-range scheme of
reproductive public works.”
There are only a few grains of sense
to the bushel of this jargon, yet a modern
Socrates would not get a hearing on the
Domain —the crowd would gather round
some “eloquent” vituperative demagogue
on a soap-box. —Abusage (S.A.).
Waste in the North
Right near the tip of North Queensland
there was a big camp during the war. It
was on some of the best soil in the north
and in a good-rainfall area. At present
there are up to 10,000 brumby cattle
breeding apd doing well there; seeds
planted during the occupation are
flourishing. There are two man-made
harbors to supply that area, a couple of
good jetties and wharves, sheds, tram-
tracks and other conveniences, hundreds
of miles of made roads, telephone poles
and barracks —all of it an empty city but
for a few blacks and millions of white-
ants.
Isn’t it possible to retrieve some of the
cost of the war? That area would sup-
port a huge population, with everything
ready for settlers to step in and start
production. Don’t squeal about markets
—if the stuff is saleable the market will
form itself. There’s only one drawback.
The Cook electorate is not in jeopardy—
it’s a sure Labor seat —and if a settle-
ment were formed there by men who
produce they might not vote for the right
party. — Somerset (Q.).
The Rabaul Boys
The Army has belatedly granted
A.I.F. status to members of the Militia
who served- with the garrison at Rabaul
at the time of the Jap landing and “who
were captured or died in the subsequent
operations.” Before July 1, 1942, they
were not permitted to transfer to the
A.1.F., though the ack-ack boys at least
were promised A.I.F. status in June,
1941, wjien they were first told that they
would be sent to Rabaul. Failure to re-
deem this promise caused much dissen-
sion at Rabaul before the invasion, as
most of the lads had volunteered into
the Militia long before September, 1939.
It was an ironical blunder to allow
transfers to the A.I.F. to start on July
1, 1942, for on that day most of the
Rabaul boys went to their death on the
torpedoed Montevideo Mam. The
granting of A.I.F. status has been made
retrospective to January 22, 1942,
the date of the battle for Rabaul, and
A.I.F, numbers have been allotted. Evi-
dently it was too great a strain on the
magnanimity of the Government which
prides itself on having “saved Australia”
to have shown a little more reverence
for the dead boys, whom they sadly
neglected in life, by making the new
status retrospective to the date of em-
barkation. —K. Me, (N.S.W.).
Crime and Punishment
It seems to me that a new approach
to the problem of crime and punishment
is required.
Punishment such as locking a sex
offender up for five years with no treat-
ment other than aggravating-his condi-
tion by close confinement, and then let-
ting him loose again, is worse than useless.
Punishment by imprisonment, even by the
lash, can only harden criminals, in-
cluding some who might be reformed
by psychological or sympathetic treat-
ment, however few they may be.
Give the offender a chance by all
means ; do everything possible to reform
him and make him a useful member of
society. Removal of the canker by that
is the most desirable way, since it restores
to society one of its component parts.
But if the second, third or fourth attempt
shows the criminal to have no inclination
or ability to be a normal member of the
community, the only other way of re-
moving him is to excise him from society.
If the public conscience revolts against
execution, the traditional formula “never
to be released” could be applied. Once
the offender has been given a reasonable
chance to reform, the penalty should be
a “minimum” one —not merely dis-
cretionary.
There are certain actions, such as
robbery with violence of a wounded
Digger—there was a case in Sydney re-
cently—which brand the doer as some-
thing less than human.— Jaques (N.S.W.).
Attacks on police constables trying to
arrest offenders are increasing.
If these attackers are themselves
arrested and appear in the police court
“ What are you going to make this time — book-ends?”
the following facts usually emerge: (1)
They were not trying to save a friend from
being run in by the police—the man
whom the constable was trying to arrest
was a stranger. (2) They had no idea of
the reason for the arrest. (3) They can
offer no excuse for their interference
or their attack on the constable.
If driven too far police have their way
of dealing with this sort of thing. When
there was talk of a reprieve for the two
men guilty of the dastardly murder of two
detectives on the Westralian goldfields
some 20 years ago the police of that State
made it plain that, if a reprieve were
granted, their members would not in
future hazard their lives by trying to
apprehend armed and desperate law-
breakers. The two murderers were
hanged. If the police know that an
attempt to arrest a cursing, drunken,
fighting nuisance will lead to a hostile mob
gathering and an attack on the constable,
with nothing more serious than a fine
awaiting their attackers, they are likely
to walk the other way and let the human
pest do what he likes. And nobody could
blame them.
There is a swift and easy remedy for
this sort of thing—it was introduced with
great success by a magistrate named Pater
in Adelaide many years ago. Gangs of
larrikins were causing a lot of trouble,
one of their specialties being to break
into the house of anyone who incurred
their enmity and smash all the furniture.
Finding that fines meant nothing to these
hoodlums Pater began to replace it with
“Six months’ hard labor without the
option of a fine.” It worked. — Forty-
fiver (N.S.W.),
Food for Britain
In the Tasmanian Assembly an Opposi-
tion member has charged the Cosgrove
Government with having “let the people
down” in the matter of a £25,000 gift of
food for Britain, “From the start,” he
said, “this has been an unwilling gift,
made only upon pressure from the Liberal
members.”
Tasmanians, who naturally thought
their money would be used to send such
wanted goods as sugar, meat and fats,
were disconcerted to find that £23,463 has
been spent on 200 tons of rolled oats (not
in particularly short supply), 2000 cases
of “kipperettes” (to Britain, home of the
kipper!) and 3000 cases of tinned green
peas (though every gardener and allot-
ment holder is growing vegetables).
Nearly half the money spent goes to
one particular firm, while the Gov-
ernment railways collect £431 extra in
freightage. Goods for the Red Cross are
carried free and taxpayers naturally
assumed that the same would apply to
their gift to Britain. —E. and O.E. (Tas.).
Police Boys’ Clubs
“Wusslean’s” remarks on child delin-
quency are timely (B. 29/10/’47), but
there is no need to go to America for
a remedy. There were many frivolous
comments when Mr. Mac Kay, the N. S.
Wales Commissioner of Police, formed
his Police and Citizens Boys’ Clubs. With
many others, I felt that the police would
be better occupied in catching criminals
than spending their time taking part in
carnivals and running clubs for boys.
• Times have changed, and there is a
string of these clubs in the inner suburbs
of Sydney. They are doing a commend-
able job. I haven’t seen any figures, but
it’s a safe bet that the money and time
have been well spent and a number of
potential lawbreakers have been set on
the right track.
I was speaking to a Balmain resident
who was very enthusiastic about the clubs.
Both his boys belong to the local one
and regard the police as their friends.
How different when he was a lad when
he and his pals would run in the opposite
direction if they saw a policeman!
R. W. (N.S.W.).
Car Priorities
A clerk I know with a few hundred
pounds to spare wanted a new car for
his personal pleasure. He applied through
the usual channels and was rejected.
Nothing daunted he applied again, this
time in the name of his sister whom he
described as a nurse with private patients.
A permit with a high priority was issued,
and within two months he had a new
car to drive himself to tennis or the beach.
I also know a dairyfarmer who fancied
a new car. He visited the control office
and, after a discussion with the powers-
that-be, submitted an application describ-
ing himself as an agricultural worker who
had to travel to work —actually the cow-
bails are a couple of hundred yards from
his house. Hie application was approved
and the farmer now drives around in a
very expensive sedan.
Many people who really need cars or
trucks may obtain them under the present
system, but, as always under bureau-
cratic control, abuses and evasions creep
in.—P. H. (Vic.).
First Things First
Arriving recently in a country town to
open a business, I installed my family of
nine in the best accommodation available
—a three-roomed “flat” with use of
kitchen. Then I began looking for land
and a builder. After five months I man-
aged to find both and drew up the plans
for my home. Not unnaturally it ex-
ceeded the maximum 1200 square feet, so
I applied to W. 0.1. for a special permit to
build.
I waited five weeks and received
no reply. In the meantime the house in
which I live was sold and the new owner
began badgering me to quit. So I sent a
reminder to W. 0.1., explaining the urgency
of the situation. Another four weeks have
passed and I have still received no reply.
My landlord is growing abusive and the
buil4er is fretting at the delay.
On the other hand, when the Common-
wealth Bank decided to open a branch in
the town, land was hurriedly purchased
and a builder promptly sent from Sydney.
Temporary premises were begun. The
brick foundation went in on Friday and
Saturday; on Monday the walls were
up ; on Tuesday the roof was on and the
glass in the windows!
It amazes me how Government depart-
ments can cut through their own red tape
when they want to! —D, R. I. (N.S.W.).
“Working for Chifley”
“Gravelsnatcher” (B. 29/10/ *47) makes
an eloquent appeal for the “whimpering,”
starving children, but his spectacles are
dimmed with sentiment.
How can we relieve the world shortage
of grain? Well, there are two methods of
approach. One is to pay some fanners
to let their fields lie fallow and to inflict
punishing taxation on those who produce
more than a limited number of bushels.
The other method is to encourage all
farmers to grow as much grain as possible
by assuring them of “full monetary value ’
for their labor and their crops.
Which method is the most likely to fill
the bellies of the starving children? The
answer is obvious. Faith in human nature
is admirable, but without works it is
dead; and the children are dying, not
from “want of heart” but from want of
wheat.
All the optimism in the world means
less to a hungry soul than a crust of
bread, and nothing will speed the plough
like the promise of a fair profit to the
farmer. — Syllogistic (S.A.).
Root of the Matter
Although the three girls in the final for
“Miss Queensland” gained almost equal
points in practically every qualification
involved. Miss Elaine Herrick, of - Too-
woomba, won by a narrow margin be-
cause it was evident “she had read not
only widely but well.” There should be
more of it. — Dekko (Q.).
A newspaper advertisement soliciting
recruits for Australia’s Regular Army
states that a prospective candidate must
be “a British subject of European origin.”
Unjust and absurd! -* Australians of
Oriental or other non-European origin
served in 1914-18 and 1939-45, so why
should they, or their children, be de-
barred from the A.R.A.? — Tom (N.S.W.).
Mr. Chifley’s claim that the Common-
wealth Bank has more depositors than the
trading banks (he included Savings Bank
depositors) made me smile. The Com-
monwealth Savings Bank accepts de-
posits from Is. 6d. When a depositor
withdraws all his cash the bank suggests
that Is. 6d, be left in so that a fresh
account won’t have to be opened if and
when he wants to bank again. Having
had to take out my savings during the
depression, I was thus persuaded to leave
the initial deposit. I never resumed busi-
ness with the Commonwealth Bank, but
my name is still on its books —one of Mr.
Chifley’s three million depositors.— Sam
(N.S.W.).
Add to the remarks of “Wusslean”
(B. 12/11/’47) that the coalmines of
Holland have never lost a day’s output
through strikes during the last 25 years.
A pleasant relationship exists between the
three major union bodies and the private-
and State-controlled managements—quite
a contrast to the deplorable conditions in
this country aggravated by a Government
bowing to the wills of the Com-
munist-controlled Miners’ Federation.
—Waddlin’ Willie (Vic.).
“Transporticus” (B. 29/10/’47) appar-
ently does not realise that coal is and will
be mined at Blair Athol (Q.) by “open-
cut.” This can be done because the seam
is a “clean” one at a shallow depth and
of great thickness. Open-cut mining is
considerably cheaper than underground
work. To work the Blair Athol seam
it is not necessary for miners to “rush
into the wilds of Central Queensland and
tear it out by the million tons.” In point
of fact, it is not necessary to employ
miners at all. The men who “tear it out”
are operators of mechanical equipment
and require no mining experience what-
ever. They are certainly not members of
the Miners’ Federation —most of them
belong to the A.W.U.— Underground
Miner (Q.).
Only the cost of living and skill are
considered in fixing wages. Both are im-
portant, but there is a third factor which
should be considered, and that is the
value of a man’s service to the com-
munity. Wages for labor should be made
up of a basic living wage, common to
all; extra payment for skill, if any ; and
a further loading based on the value of
service to the community. If wages were
fixed in this way trained nurses would
ba paid more than mannequins and gar-
bagemen more than the bookmaker’s
“penciller.” —H. Norman (Q.).
Chifley has crippled “Labor” for
years in Victoria and, probably, in Aus-
tralia. With his Banking Bill he has done
in a few weeks what Menzies and the
Liberal machine have been unable to do
in years. Liberals, in fact, should make
Chifley an honorary life member and
vote him a pension for life —he has done
even more for them than Lang did for
the U.A.P. in N. S. Wales. — Yarrasider
(Vic.).
What’s wrong with lifesavers going to
a gymnasium to get a suntan (B.
8/10/’47)? That doesn’t prove that they
are effeminate or that the only true Aus-
tralian is to be found in the country. If
a man wishes to acquire a suntan with-
out frying on the beach that’s his own
affair. For years we played against the
lifesavers in Rugby Union sub-district
competitions and they were far from
effeminate. They give up their week-
ends to make the beaches safe without
any reward, and I know that if I were
in difficulties in the surf I’d certainly
prefer a lifesaver with an artificial sun-
tan to a naturally-bronzed country lad.
