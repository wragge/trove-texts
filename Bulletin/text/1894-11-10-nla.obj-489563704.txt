American Authors.
One does not forget Cooper and Hawthorne, Bret Harte and Howells, in
wondering when America is going to produce a first-rank novelist. Poets she has—
essayists, scientists, orators, historians—who may compare with all but the highest
names in old-world literature ; but her Thackeray, her Balzac, her Tolstoi, are still
to seek, ihere seems to be something lacking in the American brain or the Ameri-
can environment, though with such a mingling of rich blood, such a variety of
climate, and such a teeming panorama of effort and incident, their chances would
appear rather in favor of a fuller, stronger intellectual life than is found else-
where. bo far, American culture tends to width rather than depth.
Interest in books and writers is more widely diffused in America than in
Bngiamd, for example; and the humblest American newspapers exhibit a literary
agility and originality which, however ridiculous in extremes, are yet preferable to
ttie comatose parochialism of most English journals outside the centres of population.
But the power of specialisation and concentration seems wanting to American
writers of fiction. They have no back to their heads. They soar high for short
flights, but lack the strength of pinion for sustained struggle. Conceive what memor-
able fruit might be borne were the method of Zola applied in a study of American
hre and character its miseries, its splendours, its industrial strifes, its ferocious
whiil of politics, its stem subjugation of natural forces ! But where is the American
Zola—gifted not only with the mind to plan such a task, but also with the tenacity
and industry to complete if? West, east, centre, north and south, one calls vainly
for an answer. Yet American fictionists have their field of special merit, though it
be not on the highest plane of genius. They are beautiful bellettrists, masters of the
® 01 1 story, which they have lifted to a pitch of dainty delightfulness only reached in
* ranee beside. Their critical novelists of the neo-realistic school, like Howell and James,
it refined to the point of weakness, are invariably graceful and witty. Most of the
authors collected below are artists in words whose style has the delicate savour of a
hothouse flower, and who treat their themes with the sympathy and imagination of
a poet.
This seiies (David Douglas series of American authors) is charmingly printed j
and the books are small and compact, suitable for the pocket. Posted at Is. 3d.

They tried to take another referendum in
Switzerland recently, aa to whether doctor’s
advice and medicine should be provided free by
the State, which was to get the necessary money
by monopolising the tobacco-trade. Now, to get
a referendum majority 350,000 votes are needed,
while to initiate the referendum — i.e. , to call for a
vote —it needs 50,000 votes. But after four
months’ canvass only 40,000 could be mustered,
so the scheme fell through. The referendum,
among its other uses, is a fine thing for showing
the real strength of the people who make most
noise, and the frequent difference of opinion
between the mass of voters and their elected
representatives.

An English professional man, whose family
sent him out'to these beastly kawlinies because he
Was a living illicit-still, turned up again in Sydney
the other day and straightway made for the
editorial apartments of the “leading” paper,
where _ he interviewed the manager and the
managing proprietor. To his appeals they
turned deaf ears. “ We read the papers, Mr.
Jentwun,” they said, with well-intended causticity
»f scorn. _ “Well, what of that? ” “We read the
papers, sir, and we know that you’re a liar, a
drunkard, and a thief, Mr. Jentwun.” “ Well,
what of thatl” was the unabashed rejoinder.
“You will oblige us by quitting these premises,
Mr. Jentwun.” Straightening himself up in a
drunken burlesque of majesty, the deadbeat
replied, in crescendo : “ Yes, I am a liar. Yes,
I’m a drunkard. Yes, I’m a thief. But I won’t
quit these premises. I’ll take a chair, because—
because I feel myself quite at home in your com-
pany, gentleman ! ” What a police-court solicitor
nas been lost in that poor pariah !

INDIGESTION
And Liver Complaint
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla
of Walkerville, S. Australia, writes:
“Six years ago, I had an attack of Indiges-
tion and Liver Complaint that lasted for
weeks; I was unable to do any hard work,
had no appetite, food distressed me, and I
suffered much from headache. My skin was
sallow and sleep did not refresh me. I tried
several remedies and consulted a doctor,
without obtaining any relief; finally, one of
my customers recommended Ayer’s Sarsapa-
rilla; It helped me from the first,—-in fact,
after taking six bottles I was completely
cured, and could eat anything and sleep
like a child.” •

(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
*J ec ? n * Meeting of Melb. University senate, Mr.
11. u. Higgins moved that the present life-tenure of pro-
fessors should be altered to a five years’ tenure. He
remarked that they had to consider whether it was advis-
able that the Council should be bound in the future to
keep on a professor who might possibly have survived his
usefulness, or that they should be compelled to have a
professor, and to pay him, so long as he was able to be
wheeled up in a bath-chair to say something. The motion
was rejected by a large majority of the senate, who
evidently considered that it was revolutionary in its
tendency and, if accepted, would most likely usher in
blood-stained chaos, Nihilism, and the Day of Judgment.
The academic life was new
To Jones, a student vain,
Who walked one morning through the U-
Niversity Domain.
Eresh from the country he had come,
To wrestle With professordom.
With silent awe he gazed upon
Each college's gray walls —
His great-great grandsire, years agone,
Had studied in those halls —
No sentimentalist was he,
But reverenced hoar antiquity.
When, 10, as he was walking there,
Came slow, the path along,
An aged man with snow-white hair,
And beard a cloth-yard long.
His beard it also was snow-white,
He was an awe-inspiring sight.
The student gazed, astounded, at
This apparition weird,
Clad chiefly in an antique hat,
And in its own vast beard.
He’d never seen the like alive—
This was in nineteen-ninety-five.
He bowed, and said, “ Good morning, sir !”
The ancient answer’d free—
The chirrup of a grasshopper
His voice did seem to be,
So weak it was, and piping, too—
“ Good morning, lad —and who are you?”
His genealogy then Jones,
The while his throat did ache,
Yelled through an ear-trumpet, in tones
That might the dead awake.
The ancient, chuckling, said —“Young sir !
I knew your great-great grandfather.”
“He came here at —I see him yet !
The time—excuse these tears !
When Mr. Higgins tried to get
Our tenure made five years.
Poor Higgins ! Do I blame him ? No !
He died some eighty years ago.”
“ His motion wicked out was bowled,
Though not without some strife,
Thus comes it that professors hold
Their billets still for life.
You see, of course, that I’m alive—
And this is nineteen-ninety-five.”
These old-time memories so amused
The ancient that his head
Wagged horribly ; but he excused
Himself, ere long, and said—
“ You’d like to know my name and rank?
Then know it—l’m Professor Blank !”
The eyes of Jones bulged fearfully,
He felt like going mad,
The ancient grinned, and said, “I’ll see
Your grandson here, my lad.”
Then, like a funeral to a tomb,
He crawled into his lecture-room.
A Yankee perjury—or must Young Aus-
tralia knuckle under at his own game ? IT. More-
land, an American, is credited with having shorn

Editor Bulletin, —The Japs, have not by
any means conquered China. They are probably
only at the beginning of their troubles. They
have adopted European arms and drill, but that
alone will not make an army successful in a long
campaign. Old Marshal Saxe said: “An army
goes on its belly like a snake.” He also said ;
“ The whole discipline of war is in the legs and
not in the arms, as some pretend.” Wellington
wrote: “ The success of military operations
depends on supplies. There is no difficulty in
fighting and in finding the means of beating your
enemy with or without loss ; but to gain your
object you must feed.” Those who remember
how Napoleon’s grand army perished in Russia
from sheer want of supplies, though opposed to
an enemy who, even in the extremity of their
misery, could hardly look them in the face;
and how the English army before Sebastopol was
nearly starved, though only seven miles from
its ships, will understand. There is yet
time for the Japs, to learn the same
lesson in Manchuria. The whole country is
intensely hostile to them, if reports are to be
believed, and if it were not it could hardly furnish
subsistence for an army, and subsistence is the
crux of the whole problem. Even so few as
10,000 men will soon eat up a country. They
themselves require something like 10 tons of food
a day. They would hardly have less than 3000
cavalry and artillery horses, which would need
some 20 tons of forage daily. Erom Seoul to the
scene of the reported victory at Ping Yang is 115
miles, or eight marches. Allow one day for
manoeuvring and one for the fight, total 10 days,
we have a consumption of 300 tons of food and
forage. Erom Ping Yang to Moukden in Man-
churia is 250 miles as the crow flies—l 7 marches.
Erom Moukden to Pekin is 355 miles, or 24
marches. In 1860, the allies landed at Tien Tsin,
less than 60 miles, or four marches, from Pekin,
and though they utterly crushed all the force the
Chinese could bring against them, and took the
capital, they could not advance further even if
their terms of peace had been refused. The
strength of China is its inertia, which is invincible,
and the Japs, will find it so.— Portfire.

Settling the People on the Land.
A year or two ago the desire to settle the
people on the land assumed an aggravated
form in Victoria and N.S. Wales. In each
of these provinces nearly half the population
is centred in one big city created mainly on
borrowed money. Neither of these cities
can show any legitimate reason for its being,
or any visible means of support which can
bear inspection. They exist partly because
they are the seats of Government; partly
because the whole railway system of their
respective provinces has been centred there
so as to drag the entire commerce of the
community into one unnatural focus ; partly
on miscellaneous finance, because commerce
having been directed there, they naturally
became the headquarters of all financial
operations; partly by the unnatural and
artificial increase in their own ground-values,
by the erection of big buildings with bor-
rowed money to keep pace with the unwhole-
some inflation of the ground-values aforesaid ;
and partly on a few small industries, and their
own alleged glorious future. Buttheindustries
of Melbourne are so few, and those of Sydney
so much fewer, and the commerce of both
cities is so small in comparison with the
numbers of people dependent upon it,
and there is such a total absence of all
reasonable means of existence for the
population, that the existence of these
bloated capitals may be fairly set down as
owing, in the main, to the influx of burrowed
money from Europe. No other country in
the world has borrowed so much foreign
capital in proportion to population, and no
other Country has anything like so immense
a proportion of its population concentrated
in one city, as either Victoria or New South
Wales. Therefore, there is at least some
semblance of reason in regarding the bor-
rowed money as the cause and the useless,
bloated, overgrown metropolis as the effect.
* * •
As the natural result of this state of things
there is, among the workers of Australia, an
alarmingly small proportion of actual pro-
ducers, and when recently the bottom fell
out of the great borrowing industry the
effect was immediately apparent. This last
remark is not to be taken in a literal sense,
for, directly or indirectly, this country still
borrows nearly all she can get. But the
debt now amounts to so enormous a sum
that all the foreign capital which finds its
way to Australia does not equal the outgo in
the shape of interest, and even the most
vigorous borrowing adds nothing to the
available cash in circulation. And with the
sudden stoppage of many industries which
existed very largely on foreign capital—with
the practical suspension of railway construc-
tion, the shrinkage of foreign commerce and
banking, the paralysis of the building trade
because the cities of Australia have already
been built altogether too much, the vanish-
ing away of many millions in paper wealth,
and the consequent decline in the demand
for all kinds of luxuries —every trade, save
that of the man who manufactures actual
necessaries, or who produces actual neces-
saries from the soil, was found to be
grievously overstocked. Victoria and New
South Wales proved, at this crisis, to have
about the smallest existing percentage of
direct producers in the world, and, in pro-
portion to their population, one of the
largest and most insoluble social problems on
the face of the earth.
* * *
Then the desire to settle the people on the
land became an epidemic among Australian
politicians. It was necessary, by some
means or other, to turn as many as possible
of the multitude of non-producers into pro-
ducers in the shortest possible time, and
therefore the idea of founding labour settle-
ments was conceived by city politicians who
had a vague conviction that agriculture was
an instinct, and that the growing of veget-
ables came by nature. In some cases the
same politicians were also troubled by a
vague assurance that the broken-down clerk,
or other retrenched city worker, could live
on a soil which the practical agriculturist
would abandon in despair, so the labor
settlements were often dumped down on
remote patches of sterile soil, on recks and
swamps and all manner of Goo-forsaken
locations ; and whosoever desired was sent
out there with a spade and an assurance of a
small Government subsidy, and bade to
settle down and prosper. They never did
prosper for many reasons. The story of the
Pitt Town labour settlement, where nothing
seems to grow except the State subsidy, and
where the whole cash return from a good-sized
community has been £5O or so, realised
by the sale of timber, has already been told.
And the utter failure of the whole village
settlement scheme in Victoria has now
become so apparent that the hollow pretence
of settling the people on the land can hardly
be kept up any longer.
• « #
MHntyre, Minister for Lands under the
Patterson regime, was the most enthusiastic
apostle of the village settlement scheme
in all Australia. The colony which he
planted in the Koo-wee-rup swamp was pro-
bably the biggest effort of his genius. By
his orders surveyors waded through this
dreary morass often up to their waists in
mud, and patiently pegged out allotments
on which 1000 or so of the Melbourne un-
employed were settled with a subsidy of £l5
per head and the Ministerial blessing. Most
of the allotments are merely five acres of
bog, in which occasionally a bony and lone-
some cow finds precarious foothold. Hardly
anything grows at Koo wee-rup, or will grow
until an immense and elaborate drainage
system is created, and the settlers who toil
miserably at singeing damp scrub, and feebly
attempting to plant potatoes in the slime and
slush, have degenerated into a hopeless race
with no ambition save to keep alive and to
find, if possible, a dry spot for standing-
room. The other Victorian village settle-
ments differ from Koo-wee-rup mainly
because some of them are rock instead of
morass; they are all, whether the soil is
good or bad, about equally hopeless,
and there is not even a semblance of
prosperity among any of them. And even in
Maoriland, where better land was provided
and more money expended, and where the
operations were conducted with an intense
earnestness which ought to have commanded
success, the village settlement scheme has
not anything like repaid its cost. The best
that can be said for the best village settle-
ment of the lot is that it has failed quietly
and respectably ; and the worst that can be
said about the worst collapse in the whole
dismal category is that it is a national
disgrace. Whether the land was good or
bad, or whether the other conditions were
favourable or the reverse, the result has
always been failure, more or less definite.
* * *
The same result, or want of result, has
attended the attempted fishing settlement in
Bass Straits, the great scheme of the Dlbbs
Ministry to turn the Sydney unemployed
into gold-miners, and every other effort to
settle the work less city population on the
land, or anywhere else. For many years
the policy of Australia’s foolish and,miser-
ably improvident politicians was to build up
a huge urban population, and the conse-
quences of that population have apparently
come to stay, for this generation at all
events. A large proportion of the hungry
and vagrant classes for whom there is no
longer room in the cities can’t be settled on
the land any more than they can in the
upper atmosphere. Agriculture —as the
city-bred politicians of Australia seem utterly
unable to realise —doesn’t come by instinct
any more than does watchmaking, or the
manufacture of boots or saddlery, or any
other trade. To the man of strength and
industry, with a small capital, the necessary
training, reasonably good land, and a market
that is not too remote, it yields about as
good returns as any other pursuit ; but with-
out these essentials it yields little, or
nothing, or less than nothing. And every
other productive occupation, without the
needful training, yields just about as much.
» # #
To those politicians who are seeking an
immediate remedy for the unemployed diffi-
culty The Bulletin respectfully presents the
theory that there is no remedy under
the sun. Australia, through its famous
borrowing policy, has more big city
in proportion to its population than any
( her civilised country. It has also, as the
natural consequence, far more clerks, shop-
men, and similar unproductive inhabitants
than the average. Unless it can be born
again and live its garish past all over once
more, there is no eqrthly probability that it
will find employment for anything like the
same number of unproductive inhabitants
again for many years to come. The problem,
so far as concerns the country at large, may
be settled by fostering manufactures and
agriculture under a wise policy of Pro-
tection, by economy, no more borrow-
ing, an entirely new land system, and
a more equitable division of the public
burdens ; but, so far as concerns a large
proportion of the individual sufferers, it will
never be settled. There is abundant hope
for their sons and grandsons, but that is all.
The infatuated extravagance of the past has
created a large class of workless citizens
who, to tell the unfeeling truth in the
plainest words, are fit for no remunerative
purpose under the new conditions which
have arisen, and who will only make first-
class funerals. What the State should do
with them, or for them, The Bulletin,
after much hard consideration of the pro-
blem, doesn’t pretend to know. What it
does know is that they can’t be successfully
settled on the land, and that even if they
could the mercantile and legal politicians of
Australia are blankly ignorant as to how to
settle them there.
The Coming Australian.
“ In certain branches of science,” wrote George
Eliot, “we can ascertain our personal equa-
tion, the measure of difference between our own
judgment and the average standard.” We can ;
but few people ever do. This “personal equa-
tion ’’—the idiosyncrasy of thought due to bias,
or training, or circumstance, which marks
every man’s departure from the norm—generally
influences those opinions to which beyond all
others their holder is wedded, and frequently
those in which he is surest of impartiality.
Every observer unconsciously reduces things to
his own measure of value and when he goes
farther, and reduces the measure itself to lan-
guage, the result is generally a very far and
faint approximation to the total truth. It is
vitiated, firstly, by the imperfection of the
observer’s mind ; and, secondly, by the incapa-
city of language to portray exactly what is in
his” mind. Thus the critics of Australian charac-
ter whose dicta were collected in a recent Bulle-
tin have all their weak points, and only in their
unanimity'lies anything approaching certainty.
In every case we must eliminate the personal
equation. Marcus Clarke, for example, dis-
cussed all Australia from a Victorian point of
view ; and it is true, as Adams says, that “ the
ignorance of Victorians concerning the facts of
daily existence in Queensland is often only one
shade less than that of full-blown British ‘new-
chums.’ ” Adams himself was an invalid with
nerves strung by disease—wonderfully keen,
but apt to lay too much stress on trifles which
appealed strongly to his sensitive brain, and
better at description than at generalisation.
But he is always in earnest, always to be taken
seriously. Clarke loved an epigram too
dearly to bother about strict accuracy, and he
wrote rather to make a smart article than to
utter sound criticism. One never quite knows
how far he meant his epithets.
# * *
Clarke’s view of the characteristics of “ the
future Australian race ” simply exaggerates his
impressions of Victorian characteristics when
his essay was written—as when he sets down
“ a form of Presbyterianism ” as the religion of
the coming nation. The pretence of profundity
with which he commences his argument was
probably used, as Poe used his science, to give
“ artistic’verisimilitude” to the play of fancy.
Clarke starts with the axiom that two things,
food and climate, determine the quality of a
race. He gives quasi-historical instances to
show that facts correspond with what might be
deduced from a knowledge of these conditions.
Then he considers what will be the food and
climate of Australia, and draws the quite unwar-
ranted (even from his premisses) conclusion that
Northern Australia will have a luxurious civilisa-
tion like that of ancientEgyptand Mexico, while
Southern Australia will be a republic—with the
intellectual capital in Victoria, the governing
capital in New Zealand, and the social capital
at Sydney. Then he sums up Victorian ten-
dencies in 1877, transfers them to the “ future
Australian race,” and closes with an audacious
climax which clinches the whole beautifully.
And there you are. Had Clarke taken the
pains to fill in his sketch with Poe’s minute-
ness of detail, it would have been remarkably
convincing. As it is, it only strikes one as
wonderfully clever.
# * *
For, in the first place, no historical analogues
will exactly fit our case. Race-quality is not
altogether a matter of food and climate. X t
any historical comparison, much must be
allowed for racial heredity ; much for differ
ence in complexity of civilisation ; much i' ot '
the constant evolution of humanity. You
cannot argue that because part of Egypt is j n
the tropics, part of India in the” tropics'
part of Mexico in the tropics, and par f
of Australia in the tropics, therefore Australia
after the lapse of 2000, 1000, or 600 years’
will repeat the history of Egypt, of India’
or of Mexico. Yet this is practically Clarke's
argument (so far as he has any argument) on
the side of climate. On the side of food Clarke
forgot what a change has been made by modern
methods of transport, as compared with the
days when commerce was all but unknown. Xhe
future Australian will have at his command Hie
food of the world ; though his own continent
indeed, is capable of varying his diet inde-
finitely. Clarke’s brilliant literary edifice in
fact, is no sooner looked at seriously than it
falls to pieces. It must be taken as it was pro-
bably meant—as a dazzling impressionist tour-
de-force, suggestive rather than authoritative
and perennially charming.
• # *
Clarke’s logical method, so far as he had
any, was bound to lead him astray. It i s 0 f
course, as hopeless to attempt to dogmatise on
the ultimate destinies of Australia as it is to
forecast the career of an infant twelve months
old. But when one attempts, what is quite
possible, to ascertain the probable drift of our
national character in a few years’, or a few score
years’ time, if present conditions continue little
modified, it is wholly unprofitable to lay the
country on the Procrustean bed of history, and
stretch or lop her limbs until they appear
to fit a set of circumstances totally
different from ours. Historical illustrations
of course, will always have value in so far as
they relate to cardinal principles of human
nature. A hungry man, nowadays, will try
and satisfy his hunger as hungry men did at
the siege of Jerusalem ; an Australian mob
differs little in essence from an Athenian mob;
the cleric who sells heaven to credulous wor-
shippers waxes just as fat as his Egyptian pre-
decessor of 3000 B.c. But Australians will
never be Jews, or Athenians, or Egyptians.
Once the world turns down a leaf, it never
recurs ; and though the writing on our page be
similar to much that has been written before
us, yet similarity is not identity. We must
dree our own weird.

Thus, in any conjectural horoscope of the
coming Australian, we must start from things
as they are, not from things as they have been.
History may be a light to our path, but it can
never be the path itself. With patient obser-
vation of facts for a few years more, sufficient
should be known of Australian character as
modified by Australian conditions to enable
general principles, the result of alien experi-
ence, to be aptly applied. But, without
preliminary induction, deduction is a tool
which slips in the hand. If thought-
ful men all over Australia, especially
school-teachers and doctors, were to re-
cord their observations of the physique, the
intellect, the morals, and the habits, of native-
born Australians as compared with their for-
bears or with natives of other districts or
provinces ; and if some such body as the
Association for the Advancement of Science
could regularly tabulate and publish these
observations; the philosopher of 25 years hence
would be enabled to speak with some authority
as to our future, and his conclusions would be
of the greatest possible value. The Bulletin
asks its correspondents all over Australasia to
forward information of characteristic national
developments as foreshadowed in individuals,
or classes, or localities, always providing that
they be chronicled with brevity and brains, f
Protected Hats.
Xhb Denton hat-mills are being discussed in
Argus after the manner of that journal,
When the Freetrade side puts its best foot for-
wa,rd, the cables-page displays the fact. When
Die ra q[ s or Die Protectionists reply, the matter
j s asaa Py relegated to the lonely back-blocks of
Die p a p er> For the most part the battle is
being waged by anonymous initials, which
fatuously certify to having; worn three or sixteen
i^ a ts green in a year. On the cables-page it is
Die beastly “ colonial ” hat that goes green—in
Die back-blocks it is the imported hat. The
mainstay of some of the anonymities in the
discussion is that people who have signed their
name s are interested parties. The crux of the
nia Der was reached when the Denton hat-mills,
through their chairman, offered to accept a
practical test of their hats, whose success they
would back by a wager. One of the principal
anonymities thereupon declared that he was
opposed to gambling as well as to Protection ;
but, seeing that the all-round superiority of
Freetrade is an axiomatic truth, it is difficult to
see where (betting, as the Foreign-trader would
be, on a dead certainty) the gambling comes in.
However, the local agents of Woodrow put
ou t a challenge at this juncture. They would
compare Denton mill hats purchased at
random in Melbourne with Woodrow hats,
a s Woodrow makes only best grade hats, and
Denton Mills make every grade required by
Die market, this challenge was not suitable for
acceptance. But the Deaton Mills are willing
to pit their best-grade hats against the world,
However, it is not the quality of Australian
bats that is the thorn in the Freetrade side.
Xhe Denton Mills pay. Behold everything!
Agriculture has fallen on its knees to the
Government, ; wool has fallen lower still, the
“ natural industries ” are drooping, capitalists
are shaking ; but this economic error, Protec-
tion, produces a thing that pays —in bad times,
too.

tions

la a “right-thinking” community the one


avenue of blessing is Foreign-trade. If the
importer and shipping-agent is doing well it is
a proof of the smile of Providence. But Vic-
toria sees the importers all enraged by recent
exposures of their tricks, and by the growing
pooularity of local manufactures. The com-
munity has been lately robbed right and left
by swindlers, and the terror of another recon-
struction time is already being spoken of in
whispers. But the good work of securing local
autonomy is going ahead. The seven fat years
are being followed by seven lean years, and in
the hardship of the present men are laying up
valuable experience for the future—experience
that will teach them to beware of the dogmas
of Free Raid —to know the land as the source
of the nation’s wealth, not as a tool to enrich
confidence-men —to know that even the wealth
in the gift of Protection will be torn from the
workers, if rogues have sway.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
That Registration Clause—Agaih.
New South Wales Parliament has definitely
affirmed that clause in the new Land Bill
which decrees that, in future, any person
taking action against a selector to recover a
debt must first deposit £2OO with the Treasury
as a guarantee that his debtor will not be fired
out homeless into the world. As a specimen of
legislative incapacity this provision is almost
unique. Its avowed object is the humane and
altogether commendable one of making the selec-
t ir'shomesteadinviolableas againsthiscreditors,
and so far as the object is concerned the only
possible objection is that it doesn’t go nearly far
enough. Not only the selector’s, but every-
body else’s home should be equally inviolable,
and, along with the home—in the agriculturist’s
ease —should go sufficient land for the main-
tenance of himself and his family. But the
i ew law, after struggling feebly round the
question in circles, doesn’t make the selector’s
home inviolable, after all. In the first place, the
bucolic person has to register himself before
he comes under the provisions of the Act, and
thus furnish profitable employment to a lawyer
in filling up the necessary documents. New
South Wales Assembly is full of lawyers, and
they are all hungry after fees, so the simple
and obvious plan of protecting every selector’s
homestead without the cumbrous system of re-
gistration was entirely ignored. Then even the
registered selector’s home isn’t protected ; the
only protection is that his creditor, when he
turns him out, must pay him £2OO with which
to get another home. The expense and loss of
time involved in finding a new farm, and re-
moving thither, will absorb a good part of the
£2OO in any case, to say nothing of the fact that
the evicted selector will often fall among land-
agents by the way, and be fleeced of his little
pile altogether; and the alternative device of
leaving him undisturbed in his old residence is
so much simpler and more effective that it is
difficult to imagine how the Reid Government
managed to avoid thinking of it. Further,
the new law is an elaborate legal swindle
upon the creditor. It was originally intended
to enact that there must be left to the debtor,
when he is sold up for his liabilities, a house
and land to the value of £2OO, and to get at
this idea it is enacted instead that the creditor,
before he even sues for his money, must deposit
£2OO with the Treasury as a guarantee to this
effect. The creditor may be a miserable little
storekeeper who never owned £2OO at one time,
er anything like it, in his life, and he may only
have a claim of £5O or so against a selector
with £2OOO worth of property. Nevertheless,
he must find an impossible sum of money as a
guarantee that he won’t turn-out his wealthy
debtor to starve, before he can even attempt to
recover his unpaid bill. The whole device is an
unspeakable bungle. Every creditor should
have a right to sue a selector and get a judg-
ment against him in the same way as he is
allowed to sue anyone else. Having
got his judgment he should be allowed
to recover his money in the ordinary
way, with the proviso that under all
circumstances the debtor’s homestead, land to
a certain value fixed by law, agricultural im-
plements, and stock to a certain limited value,
shall be inviolate whether registered or not.
As for the proposed deposit, of £2OO, it merely
makes it impossible for the poor creditor to
recover anything under any circumstances, and
it serves no other purpose except to prove how
impossible it is for a legislature of lawyers to
go straight at the simplest proposition, so long
as there is any possible chance of going at it
sideways.
Conjugal Collusion.
In Melbourne recently a certain rule nisi was
granted in divorce, the husband being the
applicant. There was no appearance on the
part of the wife, and no opposition. Later on,
however, it transpired that the husband and
wife had arranged, in a friendly way, before
the application was made, that there should be
no opposition, and the Judge thereupon de-
nounced the case as one of “ the grossest collu-
sion between the parties,” and refused to grant
the final decree. Consequently the parties con-
tinue married, and are likely to remain that
way for the rest of their lives, for the person
who is once found guilty of collusion is lost.
Of all the many derangements of the law its
rooted dislike to collusion is about the most
insane and the most unaccountable. If only
one party wants a separation, and the other
fights tooth and nail against it, and they pay
immense fees to a crowd of hungry lawyers, and
fill the papers with loathsome details of im-
morality, and tales of drunkenness, cruelty,
and sordid domestic brawls, the court generally
grants the relief requested. Or, if both
parties want a separation, and they both
apply for it, and each one fights to get it
and yet to prevent the other party getting it,
and the legal bills are something enormous,
and instead of one dirty story being told there
are two, and the legal atmosphere is filled with
perjury and lascivious information, and the
witnesses are examined at great length by
comic and dirty-minded lawyers, and both
parties are ruined, and their characters are
utterly blasted, and they are both sternly
reprimanded from the Bench, then also the
separation is granted in the great majority of
cases. But, if both husband and wife want a
divorce, and they have sufficient decency to
suppress the horrible details, and to do with-
out the cross-examination by the comic lawyer,
and to save the ruinous legal costs, by the
simple process of one party making an unop-
posed application and telling just as much of
the unpleasant tale as is absolutely necessary,
then the law heaves reproaches at them and
refuses to have anything to do with them.
The judicial objection to the collusion is
apparently based on the fact that it suppresses
the unclean details and deprives the lawyers
of their fees. The law lives mainly on fees and
unclean details, and collusion is an outrage on
the bread and cheese of the Bar.
Mrs. Mellon’s “Bosom Friends.’*
Mrs. A. G. Edwards, president of the Sydney
Spiritualists’ Association, who was present at
the Mellon exposure stance, but has held
her tongue out of compassion for the dis-
credited Mrs. Mellon and for the sake of “ the
Cause,” now comes forward to say she has
decided to make a clean breast of everything.
Mrs. Edwards, whose reputation is that of an
inherently honest and sincere woman, states
that when the rude, wicked, and unchivalrous
sceptic, Mr. Henry, collared the medium (the
same medium so hysterically belauded by
Stead, of the Review of Reviews !), she
distinctly saw the mask, the white drapery,
and the rest of the properties; and, when the
gentlemen were turned out, she went to the
bowled-out medium, who was squatting on the
floor, and—
Sticking up from the bosom of her dress, which was of
V shape, I saw a lump of coarse, dark hair, the portion
visible being fully IJin. one way and nearly an inch longer
the other. I pushed it down her bosom, distinctly feeling
it to be hair.
Mrs. Edwards and another lady then assisted
to put on Mrs. Mellon’s “ upper petticoat and
skirt,” which had unaccountably fallen off
along with her shoes and stockings in the pro-
cess of materialisation; and all the time Mrs.
Mellon persisted in squatting. When all the
other ladies had gone, leaving Mrs. Mellon still
glued to the floor in the attitude of the cele-
brated jumping-frog, and only Mrs. Edwards
remained, the medium at last consented to
arise.
She then stooped, and raising her petticoats slightly in
front, she drew something from the back, and fastened
whatever it was under the skirt with two or three pins.
She then put her shoes and stockings on, and left the
cabinet.
Then when at last Mrs. Edwards wrote to
Mrs. Mellon for an explanation, Mrs. M,
brought her explanation in person :
She said she wished to explain everything to me. She
wore the same body as that she had on on the night of
the sdance—an evening dress body, V-shaped—and said
to me, ,l You know how thin I am. Like other ladies I
am obliged to pad,” and then pulled out of her bosom an
uncovered mass of black hair, which she said she wore as
a false bust. I indignantly pointed out the absurdity of
the statement, saying that no woman would wear un-
covered hair as a breast-pad. She further stated that the
pinning of her petticoat at the bottom was in consequence
of the strings having broken at the waist, and she pinned
it there to prevent it falling off! I refused to believe
her, and she left the house.
Having thus decided that the explanation was
thin as well as the bust, Mrs. Edwards lost no
time in getting the awful load off her chest.
The public have now an opportunity of infer-
ring from this example how much the devoted
followers of any religion are tempted to suppress,
against, the interests of the public, for the good
of “ the Cause.” Continues Mrs. Edwards :
I was so horrified at the time at the prospect of
exposure and the fear that she might be searched that,
on the spur of the moment, I said, “Give me anything
you have to hide,” in reply to which she said, “No, no ;
I have nothing but at my suggestion she pinned the
front of her dress higher.
Mrs. Edwards also states that, before the
historic grab :
When “Josephine” appeared, whom I had always sus-
pected to be Mrs. Mellon herself, the form stooped to
take the flowers with a motion which I recognised as
distinctly characteristic of Mrs. Mellon.
Nevertheless, had there been no grab, and had
Mr. Henry and others not recorded what they
saw, there is no reasonable ground for believing
that Mrs. Edwards’ sense of duty to the public
would have outweighed her suspicions,
amounting to certainty, and the compassion
she not unnaturally felt for her own amour
propre and for Mrs. Mellon. However, better
late than never. For what we have all received
at last let us be truly thankful. The cat is out
of the bag. The potato is cooked. Mrs. Mellon
can now only resuscitate her mediumistic
mana by raising and reincarnating the ghost of
the Marble Man.
The Horsehair Corporation.
The Barristers’ Regulation Bill, which Miller,
M.L.A., proposes to introduce in New South
Wales Assembly, provides, among other things,
that no barrister shall practise before a Judge
who is his blood relation. If it passes, this pro-
vision will be a hard knock to one or two bar-
risters who practise almost exclusively before
their relations on the bench, but it will have
the merit, at all events, of making justice look
a good deal more pure than it looks at present.
There is no earthly reason to suppose that any
Australian Judge corruptly favours his own
barristerial relative at the expense of justice,
but when a barrister gets plenty of briefs in the
court over which his relative presides, and very
few anywhere else, the obvious inference is that
low-minded attorneys fully expect the Judge
to decide in his relative’s favour as often as
possible—or to unconsciously give the relative
tips which help his argument. Another pro-
vision not nearly so wise is that no British bar-
rister shall be admitted to practise in N.S. Wales
except by going through the ordinary local
examinations after the usual course of study,
until Britain reciprocates by allowing New
South Wales barristers the same privileges as
its own horsehair brigade now enjoys in Aus-
tralia. As things are at present, the local
barrister has to toil for a number of years at
learning the statutes of Botany Bay and passing
heavy exams, before he is admitted, but the
English barrister who knows nothing at all of
Cornstalk law, and is useless for local purposes,
is admitted without any question. Mr. Miller
doesn’t propose to suppress this custom because
it is a fraud upon the public, but merely
because Britain doesn’t admit the New
South Wales lawyer to exhibit an exactly
similar variety of ignorance in the British
courts, and to perpetrate a similar fraud
on the British public. His eye is fixed
solely on the fact that the N.S.W. Bar is ex-
posed to unfair competition, and when things
are made straight so far as the Bar is concerned
the poor old public may take its chance as
heretofore. There is nothing in the Bill to
enable the law to get at the solicitor who em-
bezzles the barrister’s fee, or to get at the
barrister who takes his fee but doesn’t appear,
and allows his luckless client’s case to be lost
through his neglect. The visible purpose of
the measure is merely to make the Bar a closer
corporation than it is at present, which is
doubtless a matter of interest to the Bar, though
of no perceptible benefit to any one else.
It is gratifying to know that the Wairarapa—
which was wrecked while sprinting at its best
pace along a narrow channel on a dark, foggy
night—was not sacrificed, along with a hundred
lives, through any desire on the part of the
U.S.S. Co. to keep up its speed-records at all
hazards. The company, it appears, gives its
captains strict orders to consider safety first,
and make speed a mere secondary considera-
tion. But so long as the desire exists to keep
ahead of a rival, speed must be a very impor-
tant consideration, and the captain who is most
certain of keeping his billet, at a time when
billets are few and captains many, is the one
who makes fast passages and also escapes acci-
dent. So he goes in for combining the two
advantages until the smash comes, and while he
is waiting for the smash he is a splendid evi-
dence that velocity can be conjoined with im-
munity from accident, and other captains have
to live up to his standard or be suspected of
inefficiency. The rule that safety is the
first and speed only the second con-
sideration is of very little account, for
no ship is absolutely safe at sea, and, therefore,
the question of how much speed should be
sacrificed for the sake of an indefinite quantity
of security is one which nobody can answer.
When a captain takes no avoidable risk and
makes a slow passage it is impossible to prove
that he would have been wrecked if he
had made a fast one ; and when a captain
makes a record passage in safety it is
impossible to prove that he will be wrecked
when he tries to do it again. Unless some pro-
vision can be made whereby the reckless cap-
tain will be sunk every time, and the careful
one will always get through in safety, or unless
things can be so fixed that a captain’s great
object will be to make slow passages, it is
hardly worth while issuing instructions such, as
those of the U.S.S. Co., at all.
The Medical Practitioners’ Bill, now before
N.S.W. Parliament, is one of the very few
measures which goes to the point without any
needless circumlocution and arrives at its
destination with reasonable velocity. It pro-
vides that any person professing to be a legally-
qualified physician or surgeon, when he isn’t
one, may be fined .£5O for his first offence, and
£5 for every day during which the offence is
continued, with the alternative of a year’s gaol.
The quack is to be allowed to practise as here-
tofore, with the proviso that in his advts. and
on the name-plate which he is required to fix
on his big front door he must add the words
“ not registered.” Consequently, that section
of the public which prefers the quack can
have him, and that other section which
doesn’t want to be treated by a quack will
have the opportunity hitherto denied it of
distinguishing between him and the other
man. A third clause provides that no
practitioner shall trade under any name save
his own. When a successful quack retires he
generally sells his business to another man who
takes his name and passes himself off as the
original ; consequently in New South Wales
even the quack is often bogus, and the public
is imposed upon, first by the man who falsely
professes to be a qualified M.D., and, secondly,
by the man who falsely pretends to be the per-
son who did the original imposition. Some-
times it even happens that one quack buys the
practice of another, and puts both names on his
door, and represents himself as whichever
party the patient wants, and if the Medical
Practitioners’ Bill abolishes this gentleman in
both his capacities it will do good service to a
lame and halt and diseased community.
. t
F. Kidd, the successor of Lane as chairman o 1
the Rue Australia settlement, writes express-
ing a pathetic surprise that “some of those
prominent in organising the movement have not
yet put in an appearance,” and explaining that
he and many others joined the settlement
“ understanding that the propagandists would
help with the management of the colony.”
Then he goes on to express a kind of mournful
hope that Mr. Casey “ will be able to fully
explain away everything, and that further
shiploads of emigrants will follow.” Poor F.
Kidd ! The chances are that corn will grow on
a gallows before any more of the prominent
organising jawsters will turn up in Paraguay,
and there will be no more shiploads of emigrants
between now and the day of judgment. Even
if Gilbert Casey could explain away all South
America it would make no difference, simply
because the public enthusiasm is as dead as
John Knox, and as flat as the beer that
was uncorked in the Middle Ages. F.
Kidd further reports that the settlement
is getting along steadily, but that some
of the men will soon be leaving. And even
supposing the colony doesn’t collapse through
famine they will most likely continue to leave
one by one from mere want of enthusiasm and
because they are tired of seeing each other,
until there is only one man left. There is
almost always a Last Man in such cases, and he
grows his hair long, and becomes a monomaniac,
and goes round gibbering and mowing to him-
self until he dies at a good old age and with
his talons about six inches long. Being the
Last Man there is no one to bury him, but
generally his faithful dog eats him in course of
time, and then mourns over its lost master until
it dies also, and that ends the show.
The late James Anthony Froude was parti-
cularly strong —not to say putrid—on the Irish
question. He looked upon the Irish race—the
non-Protestant, nou-Anglitied natives —as “a
danger and a torment to every country to
which they emigrate.” He believed in tha
Cromwellian policy of ruthless and wholesale
extermination to the glory of God and the
profit of the saints. Impaling and flogging
were methods highly esteemed by him for the
encouragement of truth in tfie Irish peasantry.
The proposed substitution—in 1719 —of castra-
tion for the mere branding with hot irons of
unregistered priests is explained and excused
by him. The fiercest barbarities of the English
and Scotch settlers are defended in that
ghastly book “The English in Ireland,”
whilst the frantic struggles of the ignorant and
brutalised peasants are painted in the most
lurid colors and condemned in the strongest
language. At their best, according to Froude,
the Irish are emotional windbags led by wind-
bags ; at their worst, they are Calibans led by
devils. To do him justice, he has one good
word to say about the miscreants. “ The ex-
ceptional and signal purity of Irish Catholic
women of the lower class, unparalleled pro-
bably in the civilised world . . . must be
attributed,” he admits, “ wholly and entirely
to the influence of the Catholic clergy.” Charac-
teristically, this testimony is borne in a little
footnote to a voluminous text about the wicked-
ness of priests, who certainly deserved brand-
ing, if not castration. Froude did as much
harm as he knew how to Ireland. But Irish-
men are forgiving. They would probably at-
tend his funeral with pleasure, if they could.
A FEW of the weak points about Spiritualism
are these : No medium has ever called up a
spirit that had a single bright or original
observation to offer about his present state.
The brightest thing that was ever said by a
spirit was that he was well and happy, and
that his grandmother was enjoying herself. No
medium has ever called up a spirit which spoke
a language which the medium didn’t speak
himself. Also, no medium has ever evoked a
ghost which gave any valuable or definite in-
formation about the past. If Spiritualism was
a reality, it could cast more light on the dark
places of history than any other agency. Think
of even a few of the things which the world is
yearning to know—why Grouchy muddled
away his splendid chance on the day before
Waterloo ; who were the Man in the Iron
Mask, the alleged Sebastian of Portugal,
Cagliostro, and Smerdis the Magian ; when
was Christ born ; what became of Cyrus,
Richard 11., Henry VI., Moses, and the
Pharaoh of the Exodus ; who or what was
William Tell; did Jean Cousin really discover
America ; and several billion other questions.
Spiritualism, which professes to be able to rake
up the ghosts of the dead past, should be able
to answer all these problems, but it seldom gets
further than rousing up a modern spectre with
a strong Scotch accent, who breathes for a
while and then goes away. And when it does
profess to arouse the wraith of a great write r
or poet or statesman he always proves to be the
same plain, drivelling idiot as the rest. It s
about time for a fresh run on Besant’s famous
spiritualistic novel, “Herr Paclus,” which
contains many valuable tips concerning the sad'
and mangy science of ghosts, and is wholesome
reading after too much of the Melton variety
of literature.
The paralysing effect of conventional religion
was never better shown than in the statement
by a Wairarapa passenger that “ many of the
poor people were praying and not holding on to
anything, so when the seas broke over the
vessel they were washed off.” Humanity learns
very slowly. As far back as we can trace its
beginnings it has been praying to a mysterious
something which it supposes to exist at the
back of natural forces, and imploring it to alter
the order of the universe to suit petty human
longings. Nothing has ever come of all the
supplications ; the gods have turned a deaf ear
to all their worshippers ; science has made it
clear that the world is governed by law, and
that breach of law is pitilessly punished ; yet
still the old, savage superstition finds vent in
vain implorings, even, as in the Wairarapa
instance, in the very jaws of death. The
crippling influence of creeds which teach a man
to pray to Heaven instead of gripping a rope is
a legacy from our prehistoric forefathers
which accumulated experience with the greatest
difficulty is extirpating.
Apropos The Bulletin’s comments on the
legal morality of Q. Attorney-General Byrnes,
a legal correspondent writes to Brisbane
Observer, pointing out that Byrnes’ law is
worse than his legal morals, and winding up :
It is better for all concerned that a solicitor should no
longer enjoy that immunity from ordinary criminal
punishment he has in many cases enjoyed. He may
receive money for investment, collect debts, sums due on
mortgage, rents, &c., for a client, and yet, unless that
client has expressly constituted him a trustee in writing,
or in writing instructed him to apply the moneys so
received or collected in a particular way, he is absolutely
outside the criminal law.
Byrnes, who has quite as much brass as law,
condescended no reply ; and the fact remains as
stated that a solicitor may embezzle his
clients’ money to any extent unless he receives
written orders not to embezzle. And, all over
Australia, clients elect lawyers to Parliament
to back up one another’s thievery. But lots of
the clients only want the chance to thieve too.
Queensland Govt, is postponing till the end of
the session the loan indispensable to prop up
its financial proteges, in the hope that a tired
Parliament will pass the Bill at once—“ and no
questions asked.” The bait Boddi.ewraith
dangles before the eyes of its supporters is a
half-dozen or so of railway lines—none of them
really very much wanted ; while all of them,
whether wanted or not, should be done without
till the Treasury pays off the existing deficit.
Of course, everybody knows that “ public
works ” will never even smell the money, which
will be simply added to the millions deposited
with the banks, while the “works” are post-
poned on one pretext or other till the crocodiles
begin to fly. But it is all taken as a matter of
course up North. People know Boodlewraith,
and Boodlewraxth knows them.

xiio Wilci-Cat Column.
The Bank of Australasia reports having made a
profit of £48,000 for the half-year—a serious falling-off
from the £60,000 realised in the previous six months —
and the div. at Die rate of 6 per cent, per annum is a
solemn thing when compared with the 35 per cent, of a
very few years ago. The Australasia’s reserve fund stands
at the same figure as in 1887. Its note circulation has
fallen off during the half-year by over £50,000, and iia
deposits by £200,000. It has also fully £600,000 less
available coin than it had at last balance, and £115.000
less in Govt, securities. Therefore, it is evident
that the present reduction in profits does not arise
through money lying idle. The Australasia is now 60
years old, and it has always been noted as a slow and
almost torpid institution. Between 1860 and 1880 it made
hardly any headway. Then it had a good time up to ’B7,
and ever since that date it has barely held its own, its
general tendency being towards a shrinkage in business.
As a beautiful example of the British conservatism with
which it is managed, £500,000 of its reserve is invested in
British consols at 2| per cent. Australian Government
debentures at 4 per cent, would yield £6OOO a year more
profit, hut the Australasia seemingly abjures mere
“kawlonial” securities.

David Elder, of the N.Z. Loan and Mercantile,
suggests, as a mild and pleasing system of bank re-
arrangement, that depositors should accept 3 or 3i instead
of 4J per cent., and that the banks should put annually
1 per cent, to a sinking fund, to be invested in Govt,
securities, as a means of ultimate repayment. By this
scheme, he points out, the whole liabilities would easily
be liquidated in 50 years. Directors have been so im-
press'd in the past by the patient idiocy of the depositor
that Mr. E. and a good many others think there is nothing
extraordinary about the suggestion that he should not
only accept reduced interest, but wait half-a-century for
the principal.

The Bank of New South Wales presents a
balance-sheet which altogether “ lays over ” those of its
two big rivals. Its net profits for the half-year are close
on £79,000, and it pays a div. at the rate of 9 per cent, per
annum, against 10 per cent, in April last. Its capital has
increased to £1,786,760, and it has made £28,815 in pre-
miums on new shares, which goes to swell the reserve
fond—said fund now amounting to £1,144,190. Also, it
has nearly £4,900,000 incash, which breaks the Australian
record up to date, and reckoning Govt, securities and
Queensland State notes, which are cash to all intents and
pmposes. its r> sources under this head are more than
£5,600,000. Altogether the B.N.S.W.’s sheet is the best
document of the kind which this depressed country has
seen for a long time.

A transaction in Irrigable Estate Co.’s shares
that came to light in a Melb. court case the other day is
first cousin to Tommy Bent’s bounty. A certain magnifi-

small debt, “ pointed out ” 100 I.E. shares to the bailiff,
and these T» f e taken for £1 by an ingenuous individual
who was advised to buy by his solicitor—although there
was a trifle of £9OO in calls owing on the shares in ques-
tion! The -Micitor also provided the purchase-money,
by ttie way. Application for transfer refused. The man
who lives upon his debts is not half smart compared with
the genius who can satisfy a writ of ft. fa. with calls to
the amount of £9OO. As to the man who bought the
shares, he looks, on paper, as if he would buy elephantiasis
if it were only offered him cheap enough.

As foreshadowed by The Bulletin, the “ Aus-

It is passing strange how quiet the Sydney and Smell-

as genuine N.S.W. capitalists, quite distinct from the
supporters of the late co., and their only desire will be to
help a despondent country out of the slough by scatter-
ing their capital broadcast, affording employment to all
and sundry, and supplying electric-light and power at
unheard of cheap rates.

One insurance agent, canvassing Sydney for the

Victoria has a merchant-squatter whose gigantic
losses in the past have puzzled the 'cutest for the last 10
years as to how he stood it. The problem will be solved
next week—the three banks who have the choicest
collection of his autographs having resolved to “put him
through.” ,
A loan for £59,000, recently floated by the Bal-
main (Sydney) Municipal Council, shows the dull and
fatuous borough fathers in a strong light. Certain old
debentures were falling due, and it was necessary to
borrow again to provide for them. Therefore, it was
decided to raise the above sum at the astounding interest
of 51 per cent, for a period of 20 years! One of the
aldermen held in reverence as a financial expert a gen-
tleman named Cohen, and the whole loan was issued to
Cohen at par, less a commission which seems to have
been given to Cohen for his trouble in taking up the
debentures. Then the same astute Cohen sold the
securities in London at a minimum of 108, and made
something like £6OOO out of the transaction. About
half-a-dozen big Australian insurance societirs, and a
dozen banks, and any number of private capitalists are
now wandering to and fro upon the face of the earth
looking for a safe investment even at a humble rate of
interest, and if tenders had been called locally the money
could have been obtained at 5 per cent.—if not at 4i—
over and over again. The inferences to be drawn from
the transaction are—(l) No municipality should borrow
through any alderman’s god, Cohen; (2) All municipal
accounts should be periodically overhauled by Govern-
ment auditors; and (3) all municipal borrowings should
be conducted under these auditors’ supervision, and not
be wholly left to dunderheaded aldermen. A tendency to
play the fool in matters of finance is the alderman’s
most conspicuous characteristic.

Ex-Premier Shiela, at the meeting of the City of
Melbourne Bank, and again at that of the Colonial, pleaded
for amalgamation of the two institutions. If Parliament
would grant certain concessions in the way of stamp-duties,
&c., so that the work could be done cheaply, amalgamation
would mean an immediate economy of probably £22,000 a
year, which would at least be something. Then both the
old, unsavoury names could be sunk, which is also some-
thing. The banks are about the same size, they are about
equally bad, and they are so small that they would only
make one reasonable institution between them. The
main difficulty is that each crowd of shareholders is afraid
lest its own hank is a little worse than the other one, and
doesn’t want to expose its weakness—a senseless fear, for
neither of them could be much worse than the other one
just now. Shiels’ case is that union will effect a big
saving of salaries, and that one bank can’t be worse than
two, anyhow—both of which are incontrovertible pro-
positions.
* • • *
One great reason why The Bulletin wants the
State to come to the rescue of the embarrassed banks by
issuing bonds at a low rate of interest in lieu of their
deposits and then—for a consideration—carefully nursing
them back to solvency, is that the smash which seems
to be coming will leave the English banks in possession
of half, or more than half, the financial business of Aus-
tralia. And if Australia isn’t tired of grinding out divs.
for British shareholders she ought to be. Hardly any-
thing worse could happen to this country than the collapse
of the local banks, bad as most of them are and have been.
To the man with the overdraft it may seem a matter of no
importance where his taskmaster belongs to, but to the
country at large, which is already sufficiently depleted
of its currency by sending “ Horae ” interest on foreign
capital, it means a great deal.

The preference shares (.£lO paid up) of the

ticularly dreadful balance-sheet coming next January.
Colonial Bank preference shares (£9 15s. paid) have
dropped to 305., and, as far as ordinary shares are con-

be given away, along with a handsome bonus, to anyone

there being no more mortgages to pay off, will probably
see alO per cent. div. all round. There are 240 hands
employed in the factory, and the wages paid during last

“ Every day sees two or three new Westralian

The Bulletin’s London correspondent. “ The lucky

these co.’s, which, it is safe to predict, will result in
enormous loss to the pigeons. All Westralian mines
are not Londonderrys. But, no matter how one
preaches from this text, it is as the voice crying
in the wilderness when once the public are‘on the feed.’
George Lockett, Colonel North’s son-in-law, tells me that
the Nitrate King is quite bitten with the gold-mama. He
has under offer to him, amongst other things, both the
Londonderry and the Wealth of Nations.” Which is almost
as if our correspondent were to say—“ He has under offer
to him Mount Morgan and Mount Hoaxley.”

A capable and cautions mining man writes : “ I
was out at the Wealth of Nations on Saturday, and was
told there was little or no gold showing in the face where
the reef had been cut in the crosscut. In No. 2 shaft
there was also no show ; and No. 1 shaft and the underlay
excavation sunk on the reef near which Dunn got the
specimens are also apparently d-stitute of gold-bearing
stone. It is a big poor reef. Dunn s specimens were
seemingly floaters found away from the reef. They
would not let me go down. It strikes me as another
Cashman’s, nothing more, having for Us foundation some
rough slugs of gold.”

Thus writes the Mining Standard’s own Oool-
gardie reporter of the Wealth of Nalions: “The cross-
cut has passed through the reef at a distance of 20ft.
from the shaft showing fully six feet in width. It is in no
way sensational, but might be termed very good." The
Coolgardie reporters who screamed over the Wealth of
Nations have all commenced to climb down. “In no way
sensational ”is good; next we shall hear that even the
first descriptions of the mine were in no way sensational.

The Lady Shenton mine, on Menzies find, is
the most permanent-looking show of the Ninety-Mile

cash offer was made for this mine, a month ago, by a well-
known, cautious and much-travelled English and Ameri-
can representative, whose fame as an expert is world-
wide, and whose co-operation would have been invaluable
to the field. But the Perth people immediately con-
cluded that it was too good to sell. Now it is announced
that some of the stone will average 200 oz. per ton, and
that to protect its richness shareholders are sleeping on

2oz. crushing, but so did the Day Dawn. It was first pro-
claimed a big 2oz. reef, then then an ounce, and
now 15dwt., and from alt one hears the manager has to
keep his eyes peeled to do even that.

It is now explained, from several quarters, that
there is no cause for alarm amongst the Fortune of War
shareholders. The mine-manager tackled the big heap
left at grass when he took charge with a light heart. He,
like the shareholders, was led to believe it was rich, but
it was very poor in the centre. How very characteristic
of most heaps of quartz on new goldfields! The writer
knows a hundred like heaps in Coolgardie—the best stone
not buried or otherwise concealed for protection, but care-
fully built around the heap to be smelt at. The next
excuse is that the salt water made it difficult to catch the
fine gold. Anyhow, the crushing was a ghastly dis-
appointment.

Junction (8.H.) acknowledges a loss for half-

(estimated) accrues on a previous half-year and is repre-
sented by an item of freight and charges on one of the
large parcels of ore despatched to Europe, which, for
some unexplained reason, was not allowed for in last
balance-sheet. A few such half-years would bring
about a second crisis in the history of the Junction, and
probably terminate in the permanent shutting-down of
the mine. The shareholders will not regard kindly
another call-paying period.
The “ accrued ” item is a significant commentary
on balance-sheets in general. The Junction for several
half-years has been credited with variable amounts of
profit. For the half-year preceding the last, for instance,
the profit was stated as £916 10s. The estimated £9Bllos.
probably accrues from this half-year, which is to say that
the profit shown, of close upon £lOOO, has been meta-
morphosed into a loss of £65.

Dear Bulletin,- Talking of gold-saving appli-

proprietors of which were a Cousin Jack and a Milesian.
Twenty grains of gold were put into two loads of ordinary
vegetable loam, ten into each. The loam wouldn’t go a
color to the acre. The Irishman got BJgrs. out of his
load, the Cousin Jack 14grs. out of his ; and yet the Irish-

at the time, but I have since learned to take tests with a

Printed to encourage correspondence on the
part of interested persons :
Dear Bulletin,— Having read your comments on Mr.
O’Sullivan’s remarks re poor reefs in N.S.W. and Vic., let
me give you a few particulars of one on the Etheridge
(Q.)_viz., the Marquis Hill, This hill has a reef from one
end to the other lying very flat, so that it can be quarried
freely, and there are thousands of tons of surface from
which we are now crushing at a five-head mill of heavy
stamps, with the aid of a good water-supply. The crush-
ing stuff costs us Is. 3d. per ton to land at the mill.
Total expenses (mill, carting and raising) under £5O per
week —from which we average 40oz. per week, worth £3 per
oz., making an average of 4dwts. per ton for 200 tons. I
think this beats the record for five head. The crushing
stuff consists of loose dirt and pebbly quartz. As soon as
we can we mean to erect another 10-head, as there is any
quantity of stuff. The show is owned by four men, all
working shareholders. Any information re the Otis or
other crushers from mines which have made extended
practical tests will be welcome. We want to know if they
will put through the quantity stated, and if the wear and
tear is very great.—Yours truly. Shareholder, Marquis
Hill, Etheridge (N.Q.), Oct. 10. [2bo tons a week with
five head it tall.—Ed. B.]

Such of the Co.’s boats as have met with disaster
attended by loss of life have almost invariably had
names commencing with “T”—Tararua, Taiaroa,
Taupo, Taranaki. If The Bulletin’s memory
is not at fault the Wairarapa is the first “ W ” to
come to grief. The Wairarapa, by the way, was
pronounced by Archibald Forbes to be the best
steamer in which he had ever travelled.
Perhaps the most pertinent query of all
the host which have followed the recent Sydney
spook-eruption is “What do spooks live on?” If
they can eat chocolate-creams they must have a
stomach to put them in, and then what else do
they put in their stomachs when chocolate-creams
are “off?” This question, however, was answered
once and for all in the heyday of spiritualism 40
years ago—when spirits first, at Home’s command,
arose from out the azure main. Spooks cannot
carry weight through the blue ethereal, and their
sole sustenance, apart from casual confectionery,
is that subtly invigorating compound, the essence
of good spirits, Marshall’s Tonic Nervine. Sold

“The New Boy,” which opened the
comedy-season at Sydney Lyceum, would have
been more interesting if “Vice Versa” had never
been written, and if various other things that
were hadn’t been. As it is, it loses a good deal of
its thrill by comparison. “ The New Boy,” like
the very old and weary boy in Anstey’s yarn, is a
man forced by a ghastly combination of circum-
stances to go to school again, and wrestle with
venerable Latin roots, and tackle weird arith-
metical conundrums concerning llflbs. of cheese
at 7|d. per lb. The principal difference between
the two comedies lies in the fact that Anstey’s
man is transformed into a boy through fooling
with a magic relic, while the other man relies on
the fact that he is short and hairless, and wears
knickerbockers. The complications which drive
him into a select academy are amusing, but not
especially convincing; and the way he is pounded
by Bullock, the senior lout, when he gets there,
and how the schoolroom tea disagrees with him,
and how he is sent out to steal green apples, and how
his wife professes to be his mother, and how, after
nearly being caned on several thrilling occasions,
a magistrate at last orders him to be birched, and
he explains everything to avoid the indignity, are
all told at length in three acts. Then the school-
master proceeds to cane Bullock, the senior lout,
and the show ought to end amid the howls of that
large, coarse youth coming from somewhere in the
back premises, but this effect is unfortunately left
out.
* * *
Mr. Roberts, as the 3Sew Boy, is intelli-
gent and painstaking, and looks sufficiently
feasible in his knickerbockers, but he manifests no
striking brilliance or originality. He is a plain
boy, and that is about all. A certain fascinating
swindler, played by Mr. Clifton Alderson, is the
character which keeps “The New Boy” afloat.
This wild-eyed person is the only stage-swindler
on record whose yellow hair stands straight out
from his head in |all directions, and he has many
good points which can’t be enumerated here for
want of space. Regarded as a well-dressed and
persuasive groveller, he takes a very high place,
and his abilities ought to keep the play afloat for
some time.
• * *
Miss Jenny Watt-Tanner is the next best
feature of the comedy, and the other five or
six members of the co. are about equal in merit,
save perhaps Eugene Mayeur, who is rather more
equal than the rest. There is no tail to the co.,
and with a little more head it would get on very
well. By some gloomy miscalculation “The New
Boy ” is preceded by a ghoulful shriek, in one act,
entitled “To Call Her Mine.” There is a
thunderstorm in it, and a stormy sea howling
against the rocks, and a drowning sailor washing
to and fro along with the crab and the corpse-fed
eel, and Clifton Alderson, who hates the drowning
sailor, laughs a Horrid Laugh in his cottage, and
sees a dripping ghost. Then he goes out and
saves the drowning sailor and is drowned himself,
and somebody comes in and states that they are
bringing along his dank remains on a board. Mr.
Alderson is a good comedian, but, regarded as a
melodramatic person who sees ghosts, he is a very
solemn institution, and the way he rolls his tragic
sentences along, as if they were chariots rolling
over a stony road, is painful to listen to.
* # •
G. Rignold still takes up arms against a
sea of troubles at Sydney Majesty’s, where
“Siberia” makes reasonable headway. The
moving spectacle of Miss Athena Claudius start-
ing with her hair down for her frozen place of
exile continues to take sufficiently well for all
practical purposes. The effect is heightened later
on, when she is seen, with her hair down, wearing
the yoke of the oppressor, with a water-bucket
slung at each end of it; and afterwards, when
she escapes from her persecutors, with her hair
down, the effect is eminently pleasing. Finally,
she is seen embarking for the happy shores of
England, where, presumably, she lives happily
with her hair down for ever afterwards, while the
wicked but beautiful Governor, Scot Inglis, _ is
left behind in chains. G. Rignold accompanies
her in her flight, and would doubtless fly with his
hair down also, only it is cut too short to allow of
such a thing. Taking it all round, “Siberia” is
a somewhat hairy play, and a clean shave all
round would produce a startling change, especially
m the case of a certain cheerful soldier, whose
countenance is like two eyes looking out of a wool-
bale.
• # #
Messrs, Ashton and Woods have leased
Sydney Royal, and open on Friday (9th) with
that patriotic British drama, “ Hands across^ the
Sea.” Said drama contains more burning allusions
to the Union Jack, and its tendency to “ wave ”
on the slightest provocation, and the fact that
wherever it waves freedom immediately ensues,
than any other production of the same size on the
modern stage. Therefore all persons who like to
be prodded into a patriotic frenzy by hearing
about the Union Jack will do well to be on hand.
* * * *
“Nana,” the lady with nothing on, will,
It is announced, be on view in Sydney for some
days longer. There were thoughts of removing
her, but the good business done has decided the
proprietary to keep their painted siren on exhi-
bition till further orders.
* * * *
At Melb. Princess’s they mustered a
Derby Night crowd of old-time proportions, in
honour of the comic opera co.’s reappearance.
“Ma Mie Rosette” was a more popular event
than ever, and when Nellie Stewart, who had
been generally admired in the paddock a few
hours earlier, made her supreme effort to the
familiar tune of “I was Dreaming,” she just
showed her ankles to the field and romped home
without turning a hair of her flaxen wig. “ Paul
Jones” was to alleviate the inevitable pangs of
Cup regret, and “Mascotte ” is the bill for Thurs-
day and Friday. On Saturday, an impoverished
racing public will invest their losings in “Mile.
Nitouche ” and the airy tableaux vivants.
* * * *
Maggie Moore, at Melb. Royal, was another
booming incident of Saturday. The experiment
of M. M. and her dramatic forces in “Little Jack
Sheppard ” appeared risky before the curtain rose;
yet the result proved the wide gulf between
“ Struck Oil ” and Gaiety burlesque is negotiable
by a nimble band of performers when a clever
woman shows the way. Apart from a few fail-
ings in the orchestra and some rugged points in
the chorus-singing, “Little Jack Sheppard” was
a success on its first night. With practice, this
entertainment, at popular prices, should be able
to challenge all-round comparison with memories
of the past and make a “draw” for certain.
Maggie Moore is not physically little, but
otherwise she plays the name-part for its
full value. H. R. Roberts makes a spry Jonathan
Wilde, and his sister is a bright, fresh young
Winifred. Miss Conroy is a capital variety of
Thames Darrell, also Miss Hardy and other
damsels cast for minor characters are distinct im-
provements upon their predecessors. Dick
Stewart and Constance Deorwyn adapt them-
selves to new circumstances, old Daniels plays
Mendez as before, and the spectacle is well
managed in all particulars. Oily Deering’s Blue-
skin might be a good deal better. On the other
hand, a much less efficient comedian might have
been chosen for the ungrateful task of imper-
sonating Royce in his L°«*--rpmembered character.
** * *
“Charley’s Aunt,” at the Opera House,
was a fact not generally understood on Saturday,
judging from the awful scarcity of attendance.
Melbourne has already seen a good deal of that
riotous female from the land of nuts, nevertheless
she can’t have exhausted all her resources in the
city. Before the present week is ended “ Charley’s
Aunt ” ought to make her presence felt in a man-
ner satisfactory to the management. She happens
to be struggling against special difficulties, for the
very name of Opera House was superseded by the
term “Alhambra ” long ago, and thus it is a ease
of a show coming straight from a “farewell”
season at one theatre (the Princess’) to another
theatre which had lately been lost behind an alias.
** * *
The Bijou and Gaiety variety shows are
getting many shekels from the festive season.
Cyril Tyler’s return visit to the To.vn Hall was
rather a frost, Melbourne having “tumbled” to the
truth that Cyril is a highly-cultivated freak, and
not a boji at all, as far as his voice is concerned.
** * *
The Bulletin is earnestly desired to men-
tion that a concert will take place at the Masonic
Hall, Melbourne, on Tuesday, the 13th inst., in
aid of a good cause. The cause in question is the
Consumptive Sanatorium of Echuca, which sorely
needs funds. Consumption is unhappily abundant,
but cash becomes tighter every day. This concert
appeals to healthy citizens, who will be admitted
free and expected to put a trifle in the plate,
* * *
Bland Holt has done such good biz. at
Brisbane Cpera House that he extends his season
for an extra week—to Nov. 9.

The fortunes of the Brisbane Opera House
are mended, the season having lasted unbroken
from Easter to Nov. Opposition there is prac-
tically none.
At Poverty Point.
Arthur Dacre, who signed an agreement for self and
wife (Amy Roselle) for an Australian season, and actually
sold up his home, besides securing several good
plays and buying expensive dresses, finds himself in
the soup, writes The Bulletin’s London correspondent.
When the full facts come out, the Dacres will be much
sympathised with. They were offered good engagements
for South Africa, which they could not, under the circs.,
accept.
Seagar, the new Charley’s Aunt, is a very diminutive
mummer, and looks wonderfully like a sparrow flirting
about the stage in a dress-suit. He has none of Thornton’s
unction, and is a closer imitator of Penley, but imitation
is not always the successfullest form of flattery.
Abell, of Abell and Klaer, was in Australia with Cooke,
Zoyara, and Wilson’s circus 26 years ago. He is 68, and
has been ii years in the sawdust.
Moke: “Without meaning it offensively, I doubt if Ben
Brown is Cissy Loftus’ father. He seemed to take it very
coolly when a newspaper interviewer rushed to him with
news of the wedding, while Marie Loftus was out of her
wits. Was she not married before Ben ?”
Harry-Australian-Orpheus-Atkinson was at latest going
to Paris to do a trial week at the Folies Bergferes, and if
he caught on he was to have a big engagement.
Olga Nethersole, and the rest of the leading people in
Daly’s Co., have signed for a tour through Australia
when the American venture is over. Olga is really a fine
actress now.
“ Nothing succeeds like success.’’ No sooner (remarks
The Bulletin’s London correspondent) did Beerbohm
Tree hear of the hit made by “ The Fatal Card ” than he
telegraphed for Haddon Chambers to go to him at Edin-
burgh to discuss the scenario of the new play which had
been written for him ; doubtless it will be selected to
follow “A Bunch of Violets” at the Haymarket. Had
not the critics gushed about “The Fatal Card,” Chambers
would have waited long ere he saw his name again upon
the play-bills of that theatre.
The Argos account of Abel and Rlaer’s circus, on the
opening Melb. night, described how the wheel of the
monkeys’ coach came off and the monkeys descended and
replaced the wheel. As a matter of fact the monkey who
should have done this got involved in a quarrel with
one of the spectators sitting near the ring, and the trainer
had to do the coach repairs himself. But the clever
simians have made a big hit.
Lalla Miranda has been warbling “Sweet Bird” to the
Hielandmen o’ Dundee with much effect. One or iwo
London offers for light opera have been declined by the
modest Lalla.
London Stage says that Baker, of Bland Holt’s Co., is
the best actor Australia has produced. Tub Bulletin
remembers having said something verging upon this after
seeing Baker play a certain wicked attorney.
Seagar, the new Charley’s Aunt, talks very like that
johnnie-chappie in “Morocco Bound.” Who was the
original seed-idiot of this sort, and what made him talk
like that, and where in England do they teach people to
talk “chaw-chaw?” By the way, it isn’t absolutely
necessary to be reared in England to talk “chaw-chaw.”
The eyeglassed professional youth—at least he once was a
youth—who when he is talking “champs” more than
any other person ever heard on land or sea, is the son of
an Australian judge, who is himself an Australian; and
“ Jawge,” who apart from—or, if you like, even includ-
ing, the “ chaw-chaw ” —is an immensely good fellow, is
understood never to have been out of Australia in all his
life.
Melb. Standard, re an entertainment in aid of St.
Patrick's Cathedral building fund, said—“ Many well-
known artists will appear, amongst them being the youth-
ful prodigy, Miss Clara Merivale.” This staggering
announcement was accounted for in the next line—
“ Master Percy Grainger will also take part.”
“ Little Luna,” the latest child performer at the London
’alls, appears to be a niece of the sisters Leamar. Whether
Luna’s mother is the Leamar who once married into the
noble Feversham family, or the elder sister who com-
mitted matrimony with Mr. Bill Bint, or whether Luna’s
father is a male Leamar, The Bulletin can’t say. Alice
Leamar, of boom-de-ay memory, is the child’s aunt, any-
how, so she ought to be a simple, retiring sort of infant.
At present Luna knocks the multitude with “Master’s
got his eye on me I” ,
Mr. and Mrs. Brough do not leave Australia for England
until after Boucicault’s return in April. At present the
00. are doing fair business in Adelaide, although the
audiences have never overflowed since the first nights of
“ Tanqueray.”
“ Mister James," of S.M. Herald, came out in a new
r6le t’other day—he led a deputation to Mayor Manning
for a public benefit to Signor Hazon, who goes for a health-
trip to Europe.
Ada Crossley is lucky to be a contralto. Do you think
Melba would have enthused with tears in her eyes over a
rival soprano?
Of the two Melb. pantomimes the Royal has the
prettier and shapelier, and the Princess's the older and
more experienced chorus and ballet girls. The former
receive 15s. and the latter 255. per week.
Several stage-struck society girls who were engaged at
an Australian metropolitan theatre recently simply to
“go on" in a burlesque, failed to answer the "call one
morning, and, when asked for an explanation, asserted
that the call-board notice was: “Chorus, Ballet and
Extras, 10.30;” and, as they considered themselves
“ Principals,” they had not obeyed the order. Next day
the assistant stage-manager posted a “call” thus:
“ Chorus, Ballet and Society Young Ladies.” That had
the desired effect, but the society young ladies became
very indignant, considered it a great insult, and appealed
to the manager, who dismissed the A.S.M.
The Sapio-Urso Co. travelled to M.L. per Wairarapa,
but disliked her so much during the first trip that they
lost a week in Auckland rather than continue the coast
voyage in her.
McNicol Turner, the self-advertising young man who
secretaries Melb. Lyric Club and stars himself on its pro-
grammes, is, like the Cunninghams, a prominent oars-
man, being a member of that toney institution, the Mel-
bourne U.C., a club which has distinguished itself by
being the most superior in its ideas and the most inferior
in its rowing of any on the Yarra. The Melbourne is
about the only Vic. rowing club that still clings to
the ancient custom of excluding manual-workers.
Maddocks, the diminutive tenor, a son of the
Melb. dentist of that ilk, also developed his head-notes by
yelling “ Yep 1” to sprinting crews on the home-stretch
by Princes Bridge.
Miss Dudlay, the latest imported acquisition of the
Brough and Boucioault Co., was selected by Cartwright
as understudy to Mrs. Brough. She never appeared
before an audience till she came to Australia, but shapes
excellently. All the same, seeing what was wanted, it is
not surprising that Boucy and Cartwright have since
exchanged curses.
There is nothing original under the sun. Elton’s
favorite gag, in “Morocco Bound,” is, “Oh, I am enjoy-
ing myself !” and the same gag was the mainstay of a
pantomime staged in London 28 years ago.
Gherchez la femme again over the Czare-
witch. What can be more palpable than that his
father has been trying to force on the wedding,
and that he refused, threatening even to abandon
the succession, through another tendresse? How
a woman will reach out for a Crown! Princess
May, for a recent example.
The most striking feature of Melb.
Cathedral service at Dean Macartney’s funeral
was the advanced age of most of the diocesan
clergy. Out of the 70 or so present only about 15
per cent, seemed under 45. Of the remainder
many were over 60—the age at which the local
legislature declares men to be worthless. Once a
clergyman gets a good billet he sticks like wax,
and smiles blandly at the congregation’s strongest
hints. The only way to get rid of the aged
incubus is to stop his screw. Then he goes
instanter, calling on the Lord to curse you.
More S.M. Herald slobber :
The death of the venerable Sir Alfred Stephen, who for
eo long a period had occupied moat important offices in
the State, and who by his high character and amiability,
added to his talents, was equally admired, respected and
loved by the people of all ranks ; and as he was honored
in life, the regret has been general at his death, and it
has been felt that so long and useful a life was fittingly
closed by the painless, peaceful manner in which the end
came. All that respectful, genuine, &c.
The anguish of this eloquent scribe, it will be
perceived, was so poignant that he forgot to finish
his sentence. Grief paralysed his grammar !
A few items from the evidence re Waira-
rapa wreck last week, on Great Barrier Island,
M. whereby over 115 lives were lost: “The
primary cause was the vessel going at a high rate
of speed through a dense fog, and striking on a
rock some 20 miles out of her proper course. . .
Captain MTntosh had been remarkably free from
accidents, and had the reputation of being a sin-
gularly careful officer. . . The precautions
specified in the regulations for vessels at sea dur-
ing thick weather were not observed. The engines
were not slowed down, the lead was not used, and
the foghorn was not blown. . . Captain
MTntosh was a splendid navigator, a grand dis-
ciplinarian, and a solid man.” And if the un-
fortunate captain, who was amongst the drowned,
had missed that disaster by 20 yards, he would be
all these things still. A splendid seaman is evi-
dently a man who takes desperate risks and has
the luck to come out right; and a bad seaman is
the same man when his luck leaves him, and the
pitcher goes to the well once too often.
Editor Bulletin. Along the eastern
shore of Darling Harbor, Sydney, are a number of
pieces of land never alienated by the State, which
have been jumped by, and are in the possession of,
certain enterprising people. Some of this land
has even been brought under the Real Property
Act—illegally, of course, as possession gives no
right against the State. These lands are valued
by Mr. Engineer Darley at .£l5O (one hundred
and fifty pounds) per foot frontage. The facts are
known to both the Lands and Works Depart-
ments ; also to the members of the late Public
Works Committee and the late Minister for Lands
and Works. Not the slightest attempt is being
made to put the State into possession of these
lands and the considerable revenue derived from
them, and, as usual, in the fulness of time the
country will purchase its own property at three
times its then value from the people who have
grabbed it, or their assigns. It was openly said at
the time—and never, I believe, denied —that Darling
Island, to resume which £90,000 was paid, had
never been alienated, but merely jumped, like the
lands just mentioned. Isn’t it nearly time that
N. gave up the sorry farce of making believe
that Government is run in the interests of the
people, and acknowledged What is pretty palpable,
anyhow—that N.S.W. institutions merely exist
for the benefit of land-grab? All the facts in con-
nection with this matter may be found in the
schedule to the “Return respecting proposed
reclamation of Darling Harbor,” printed June 8,
1894.— Yours, Charles Brown.
“My hands are clean—and empty.”—
Kossuth.
The Vic. Artists’ Society is holding its
annual exhibition of pictures under specially
depressing circumstances. In the first place, the
collection of new works is so small that the broad
tracts of gallery at the Society’s disposal are
mostly decorated with old and awful paintings,
contributed by the members to a mysterious art-
union which was inaugurated six months ago, and
threatens to drag much ere reaching an issue. In
the second place, the dreary drip of desultory
visitors into this commodious building denotes
that public belief in Victorian art has been shat-
tered by its high priests. Apart from personal
friends 'of exhibitors, the daily pilgrims to the
shilling show at Albert-street might be counted,
perhaps, on the fingers of the doorkeeper, whose
assumption of briskness is one of the most artistic
things on the premises.
Eighty-four frames include the whole annual
exhibition of paintings in oil. Taken altogether,
they are considerably below the average merit of
last year’s display, and the trail of Victorian art
is over most of them. Even a tried and trusty
performer like J. Mather seems to be degenerating
into unnaturalism, as witness his chromo-like
“Evening, Healesville.” Near it hangs “ Moon-
rise,” a much-belauded work by D. Davies. A
beautifully round and bright moon rises in a blue-
gray sky, upon a sagey-greeny desert, the land-
scape being relieved by faint reflections of crimson
glory from a sun which has lately set. There is a
pretentiously gloomy school of art that threatens
to exterminate all other schools in Victoria, thanks
to the critics who praise its dyspeptic results.
Fifteen or twenty efforts at reproducing Nature in
her ugliest moods must have been incited by a
combination of tough meat, bad cookery and
strong tea. Portraits of “ Mile. M. L.” and Miss
Adey Brunei, by Tudor St. G. Tucker, are clever,
wholesome views of pretty women effectively dis-
played, though it must be admitted that Miss
Brunei’s face on the canvas is not a striking like-
ness of the original. J. C. Waite’s portrait of
Winter Irving, M.L.0., commands admiration for
the artist, and the children of Dr. Springthorpe,
by E. P. Fox, make a satisfactory picture.
Artists can’t afford to be eccentric in treating such
subjects.
It is when he gets under the broad canopy of
Heaven that the Victorian genius indulge* his
taste for originality. A bogus landscape impres-
sion, veiled by a weird artificial mist, must have
appeared to some unhappy genius in a vision years
ago, whereupon he painted an impossible picture,
from which the modern caricatures of earth,
foliage, sky, air and water have emanated. The
proportion of misty smudges and crazy-colored
bush-scenes in these exhibitions grows bigger
year by year. Artists get drawn into the
vortex of impossibilities and lost before they
know where they are. Miss J., Sutherland
painted pleasant little suggestions of the Creator’s
handiwork twelve months ago, but now she
goes in for Victorian art-tints, and produces
foliage that must have been dyed in a double
extract of orange-peel. Walter Withers depicts a
chimney-pot of the same color, so perhaps it has
been specially manufactured for the society. A
good man in John Ford Paterson has seemingly
sacrificed his early principles. His formidable
picture, “ Evening,” is sky for the most part-dull,
impenetrable sky that conveys littlesense of atmos-
phere. Many cheerful panels are to be found smiling
amidst the bile and misery of the landscape
studies. Bits of gorse, clusters of chrysanthe-
mums, and other floral growths are, in most cases,
skilfully and kindly dealt with on wood. Also,
there are several bunches of grapes, but the mono-
tony of grapes is growing intolerable.
Neuralgia
is the first, surest, and most reliable sign of nerve
decay; it is a symptom provided by nature to
warn the sufferer of approaching weakness and
distress. Though in most cases the pain is purely
local, the disease is constitutional; and local reme-
dies such as liniments, oils, and menthols only give
temporary relief, and do not do the slightest per-
manent good, for they only act by deadening the
sensibility of the affected nerve. The remedy, to
be of any lasting benefit, must be tissue-forming
and nerve-strengthening, and must have general
invigorating properties ; it must also contain the
material to restore the lost tissue to the impover-
ished nerves, and no remedy except Clements
Tonic possesses these wonderful powers. Clements
Tonic has been used in thousands of cases by
young and old of both sexes for neuralgia, sciatica,
and other nervous complaints, and we have never
heard of a case where it has failed to give
quick and prompt relief. Read of the case of
Mrs. T. Watts, Woonona, N.S.W., who writes on
March 23, 1893 :—I have suffered severely from
indigestion for the last three or four years. I was
unable to sleep, and had a continual languid feel-
ing, loss of appetite, severe pains in the chest and
stomach, and was half of my time unable to per-
form my household duties with any degree of
pleasure. I had the advice and medicine of
several doctors, but without receiving any benefit.
Hearing Clements Tonic so highly spoken of for
the above complaint, I resolved to give it a trial.
I felt myself improving from the very first dose,
and am happy to say that before I had finished
the first bottle all disagreeable symptoms had dis-
appeared, and I felt better than I had done for
years. I have never had a return of the old com-
plaint since. I recommend it on all occasions.—l
remain, yours gratefully, Mrs. T. Watts, Woo-
nona, N.S.W.

Two out of the three Yic. judges las^

Both are victims of the financial smash.
At Mount Barker (S.A.) local court, Oct.
23, Mrs. Webb, 101 years old, was plaintiff in a
breach of agreement suit, which she won.
Premier Kingston now works hard at his
private law-practice. For a year after acceding
to power he never set foot in his private office, but
he is growing wise in his generation.
Rogers, a new Yic. M.P., spoke of Speaker
Berry’s appearance without a wig as “the only
gleam of sunshine ” he had seen in the House.
But really Berry is not nearly so bald as all that.
Two ex-M’s.L.A., rejected at last N.S.W.
elections, are endeavouring to forget their defeat
in the throes of historical composition. _ Both are
engaged on what they hope to call histories of
Australia.
A Vic. farmer who lately died left his
property to his wife, on condition that she
remains a widow. If she marries again the will
directs that she be allowed to “ take her husband
and one cow.”
Governor Kinlore’s mother draws so large
an annuity from the paternal estate that there is
nothing left for him. That is the chief reason
why he accepts .£5OOO a year and expatriation as
Governor of S.A.
Col. Warner, Commandant of Tasmanian
forces, has resigned that billet and accepted the
post of Governor of Hobart Gaol. This was told
to General Hutton lately as a new reading of the
sword and ploughshare adage.
Some admirers of an ex-M.L.A., badly
beaten at a recent general election, subscribed
nearly .£3OO as balm to his wounded feelings. On
the very night that he got the money the ex-M.P.
played cards and lost every shilling.
How does Cardinal Moran reconcile his
attitude against liquor when heading a children’s
total abstinence league, with the presumably per-
mitted use of his name, by wine-merchant Fallon,
as one of his most influential patrons?
Down South. Prisoner (to his lawyer, Mr.
F ): “ Tell his ’Onor that’e knows me. I’m
the lad wot licked the Crasher at the M.A.C.

give you life !” whispered the mouthpiece.
Purves was struck by O’Hara in the
morning, appeared in a case in court before
noon, won a pigeon-match in tlie afternoon, and
sat out a lecture on Imperial Federation in the
evening. A good day’s work for any man.
Mannington Caffyn has taken consulting-
rooms in Fleet-street, London, in the well-known
house which was one of Cardinal Wolsey’s palaces,
and which is now occupied by a hair-dresser. He
intends to practise his profession diligently.
Spagnoletti : “Saw Henniker-Heaton to-
day, first time these 18 years. Not mightily
altered, save in the indispensable orotund. How
hateful is the English prunella ! Graham Berry
is percolated with'it, and twiddles a kid glove.”
Jennie Swift, the good-tempered Aus-
tralian aboriginal who lectured through England
a dozen or so years ago, died the other day at
Warangesda. Jennie, like certain Australian
politicians, endeavoured in her latter days to
fortify most of her actions with British prece-
dents.
David Syme's statement that
the contempt-of-court speech—fine,
.£lso—against Speight was unpreme-
ditated and burst from him in an
ebullition of feeling, is the confession
of a sin which he never tires telling
members of his staff and other press-
men is a capital offence in a journal-
ist. “ Give me a drunkard rather
than a journalist of ebullitions,” he
is wont to say.
The large Stephen family,
though located in Sydney for three-
quarters of a century, is widely and
strangely scattered in death. The
Australian head, John Stephen,
early puisne Judge of N.S. Wales
(Supreme Court a pensioner), and Lis
wife rest in a water-filled vault in the
old Sandhills Cemetery (Belmore-
road, Sydney). Other members of the
family are there also, notably another
John Stephen, father of Melb.
Attorney Frank Stephen. Alfred
Stephen, recently dead, has beep
taken to Randwick, where lie his
second wife, her mother and a
daughter. A sister of Alfred is buried
at Yass, and bis son Consett lies in
an English grave. Another son, the
Canon, finds his last home at Rook-
wood. A third son, Edward, is in
Waverley Cemetery. Alfred’s first
wife is buried in Hobart. His
brother, George Milner, is interred
in Melb. General Cemetery, and
Milner’s son, Harold (ex-M.P.), is in
Rookwood. Other minor members of
the family repose at various points
of the compass. Alfred Stephen
makes the second N.S.W. Chief Jus-
tice interred at Randwick, James
Martin being the other.
Yic. Labor-party has a pronouncedly pious
bias, and most of its members are amateur cushion-
punchers. John Hancock can sing, without a
book, any hymns that come along ; Gray is a local
preacher ; Trenwith, Winter, and Prendergast are
prominent church-goers.
Dear Bulletin, —Not many weeks ago
Sydney newspapers recorded that Altred Stephen
had received birthday felicitations from scores of
people on reaching his 92nd anniversary. Some
papers gave lists, but, somehow or other, the fol-
lowing birthday-card (a similar one to which had
been sent annually for years to the ex-Judge) was
not mentioned; —
The spirit of Mary Brownlow congratulates you on
having reached your 92nd birthday anniversary, and
awaits you.

A recent visitor to H. Parkes heard the
old man laughing long and lugubriously. When
asked what he had been laughing at, the veteran
replied, “ Hi was honly teaching a parrot to larf.”

parrot ! Sancta simplicitas I
The late Melb. City Councillor, J. W.
Pierce, eared nothing for posthumous literary
fame. He left instructions in his will that his
diary, containing an account of what he saw and
did when he visited Europe, some time ago, should
be destroyed after his death.
Mrs. Juncken publishes in the Adelaide
press a private letter from her son Otto, to prove
that he did think Mrs. Needle guilty of the
murder of his brother Louis, and the attempted
murder of his second brother, and of the poisoning
of her husband and children.
The Czar Alexander 111. was a big mar
and a mighty monarch. He obscured half the
world’s-eye, so to speak. Yet, see what a mere
pin-hole his departure has left in the cosmic
bladder ! Then, go, thou Swelledhead, and look
at your own shadow sideways.
The clairvoyant and spook-raising business
pays divs. A N.S.W. fortune-teller, who recently
got a very bold advt., married her son to one of
her richest lady-patrons ; while the husband of a
now notorious ghost-merchant has had his Civil
Service salary very substantially raised of late.
After a certain well-known N.S.W. publi-
can had had his severalth fire and had drawn the
insurance-money, he took a trip to Europe, and,
like a good Catholic, called in at Rome. On being
shown the ruins of the Coliseum, he asked the
guide—“ln phwhat company was it insured?”
Even the presence of Gov. Hopetoun and
his bespangled suite and the throng of fair women
could not compel Premier Turner to sport a black
frock coat or a stove-pipe hat at Vie. Parliament
opening. He followed behind Speaker Berry in
his ordinary attire —a grey tweed sac suit and hard
“ boxer ” hat.
From West Australian, 24th Oct. :
Lord Percy Douglas, having received cables confirming
the sad news of the accidental death of his brother, Lord
Drutnlanrig, whilst shooting in Somersetshire, a service
in memory of the deceased peer will be conducted by the
Rev. J. Orchard, in St. John’s Church, West Perth,
to-morrow (Thursday) at 11 a.m.
Every visitor to Melb. Public Library
doesn’t go there to sleep. Some go to read—also
to mark. There is in the Barry Hall a copy of
Anthony Trollope’s book on Australia, over the
pages of which pencilled comments like these are
scattered: “Hear! Hear!” “Good iron!”
“ Alas, too true !” and, in one instance, “ You are
a liar, Anthony ! ”
Henniker Heaton’s improvement as a
writer should be an encouragement to young men
ambitious to become great. Who that reads his
wonderfully well-written article in last Pall Mall
Magazine, and others on the subject of Divorce,
can credit that they were penned by the man who
used to contribute such strangely-composed notes
of travel to the Evening Noose?
The inference loosely drawn from Mrs.
Needle’s having gained a pound and a-half in
weight during her incarceration is that she was a
woman of settled diabolic purpose, unaffected
either by fear or repentance. The much more
natural inference is that her diet and sleep and
exercise were more regular in gaol than when she
was free. Almost all the N.S.W. bank prisoners
have gained in weight—and those who were
sickliest when outside have gained the most.

The Late CAPTAIN M'NTOSH, of the ill-fated
Wairarapa.
An Adelaide paper tells how Yilleneuve
Smith, the S.A. lawyer, was recently opposed, in
a case, by one of the smallest advocates at the
local bar. He made a somewhat rash assertion on
a legal point, and the Judge remarked doubtfully
that he would like to hear what Smith’s learned
friend had to say on the point. “My learned
friend,” murmured Smith, with the air of a man
awaking from a dream, and, putting up his eye-
glass, he looked anxiously round the Court in all
directions. Then suddenly his eye rested on the
crown of his small opponent’s head, and he bent
down to assure himself that it was genuine. “ Oh,
there you are!” he said, joyfully ;“ I was afraid
I had lost you,” and he went on with his argu-
ment, leaving his enemy too muoh broken up to
answer.
Apropos of silent M.sP., Donald Wallace,
M.L.O. of Victoria, and owner of Carbine, holds
the record. Donald was elected for Clermont, Q.,
in ’B3, and sat till ’BB. He never addressed the
electors either before or after the election. He
never went near them. He attended the House
about three times, but never once spoke. The
local paper came out once with the middle column
of its principal news-sheet blank. The virgin

space was headed “ Our Member in Parliament

column was —“Mr. Wallace still speaking.”
Cochrane, the computer for Q. Trig.
Survey, who threw up his Govt, billet (.£3OO a
year) to edit the Charters Towers Eagle, and
was run out by grateful Demos after making the
paper a success, is now with Brisbane Courier.
There are two kinds of papers which will not
tolerate the expression of honest convictions by
their staff —rank capitalist organs and rank labor
organs.
A Sydney newspaper-man who attempted
to express himself caustically, in mixed company,
on the expenditure of .£4BO Treasury funds in
pioknicking Mackenzie-Bowell, of Canada, was
promptly pulled up by a prominent politician :
“You shut up ! You sat at the table and ate and
drank your whack of the swindle. We have
enough to do to fight the dogs that were kept in
the street.”
The great episode in the career of the
late Colonel Smith, M.P., of Ballarat (Vic.), was
the Financial Statement which he delivered in
1879. Poor Smith, who was as innocent of figures
as a child, quite forgot about the interest on the
public debt, and announced a glorious surplus of
about .£1,000,000. He was never allowed to
deliver another Financial Statement, and nobody
regarded him as a serious politician thereafter.
Evangelist M‘Neill—address, Hotel Aus-
tralia, where they chase you with a plate all day
—has a six-year-old who, the other day, asked his
pa “if ever be worked on the railway.” “ Yes,”
said the holy man. “And were you a porter?”
“Yes.” “ And did you wear rough clothes like
they do now?” “Yes.” “But that,” remarked
the bright boy, “ was before you were a gentle-
man.” Even the boy noticed it, that the Bible
paid better than the railway.
Melbourne papers continue to dig up
letters of Otto Juncken’s bearing on the psycho-
logical aspect of the threaded Mrs. Needle. In
one the young man philosophically finds much
comfort in the turn of events from reflecting that
had the truth remained unknown he would, in all
probability, have married his Martha and been
arsenicked by her in turn when she was seized by
“ that tired feeling.” A reflection like this would
reconcile a man to a much heavier loss.
Australia’s darkest-browed and most scowl-
ing- visaged legislative pietist, teetotaller, and
Orangeman has one redeeming virtue ; he is an
accomplished and inveterate card-player, and
always carries a pack about with him, to the
horror of his constituents. But he was not always
a euchre-enthusiast. When he kept a book-shop
a raw Highland digger once looked in and asked
him for a pack of cards. The future member was
wildly indignant. “Do you think,” he asked,
“I’d keep the devil’s prayer-books in my shop?”
The miner retired and told his mates, who, in
revenge, fairly pestered the saintly bookman with
enquiries for cards, of which at last, seeing money
in the business, the man of heavy eyebrows bought
a big stock cheap. But after that bookseller’s
Fall no one asked for cards, and it is surmised by
the scoffers that economical reasons prompted him
to learn the game himself rather than let the cards
go to waste !
Swilliam Clarke was really a study at the
meeting of the Colonial Bank (Melb.), at which
Shiels told the banking people generally that they
would either have to amalgamate or burst. The
Bart, labors under a fatal inability to keep awake
while any speechmaking is going on; he j ust
dozes off till it is finished, and is then nudged by
some friendly person. He seemed to be under the
impression that Shiels had been making the most
flattering and complimentary remarks, and smiled
gratefully when the jeremiad came to an end.
The gilded N.S.W. squatter
Rand, lately deceased, was an nn.
sociable hunks. One day his bank-
manager, at the nearest township,
having heard that a pet portion
of R ind’s run was going to l«
free-selected, thought to please
the old man by riding over to the
station, in company with a friend
and giving the big squats
warning. “Well, what do you
want ? ” grumpily asked Rand,
The manager imparted his news.
“ L“t him take what he likes and
In hanged to him,” surlily quoth
tb? old fellow, without a word
of thanks. “ What shall we do
with onr horses?” enquired the
bank man. “Take ’em round to
the shearers’ hut,” which they
did, and returning yarned with
Rand for a short time, when the
tea-hell rang. Then the old fellow,
with a gruff, “So long!” retired,
leaving his hungry visitors to take
their long ride home.
Col. Softgoods Sargood was
Vic-’s first Minister of Defence,
and in ’B7, when the cable was
interrupted, created a genuine
local war-scare. The sagacious
ragman saw in the cable trouble
a dark design of the enemy, who,
Sargood intuitively decided, was
the treacherous Russian. It was
Sunday, and Sargood, who is sanc-
timonious, had a passing twinge
of conscience, but heroically sup-
pressing it, by ’phone and ’graph
he ordered the fleet, reserves and
militia, to the Heads. They went,
with smiles upon their lips and
lead upon their hearts, to await
the foe. But the cable got going
again—it had merely become dis-
insulated or something, and had
not been tampered with by the
Muscovite at all. The warriors
returned to town and were
greeted with painful signs of
derision. But it is all forgotten
now, and Sargood is ready to do
the same again when he gets an
excuse.
A new story of the late Mayor Smith's
large feet. A Ballarat East mine, the Sulieman
Pasha, probably, was wanting a State-grant badly,
and desired the Mayor to back the local member
in rolling the little log. William Collard S. agreed
to honor the mine with an inspection, and went
below. Whilst he was prospecting the drives
something went wrong with the cage, which
jambed on the skids. Then the braceman was
heard shrieking to the engine driver : “Stopher,
Bill! Stop her, for the love of Heaven! The
adjective Major’s blanky feet have caught in the
crimson shaft!”
Graham Berry revives old and respectable
memories of the Vie. Speakership by appearing in
a plain black silk gown. ’Tis a meek suggestion
that the 200-guinea imported robe of Matthew
Davies and the cheaper, but gaudier, garment of
Tom Bent were mere boom-time excrescences upon
political life. The solid silver gilt Daviesiau mace
came to a bad end, and the surroundings of the
new Speaker are such as ruled in the Peter Lalor
period, when an easy billet was reckoned a tit
reward for hard service, and the first commoner in
the land had done something to entitle him to a
marble statue after his decease. Berry, when one
comes to think about it, seems positively the only
man in Victoria with a ghost of a claim upon
public gratitude.

POLITICAL
PONTS
Deakin, on dit, has an ambition to shine
in English politics.
A severe homily on the capacity of the
present N.S.W. Parliamentary Labor-party may
he founded on the smallness and incoherent
character of its contributions to the discussion of
the new Land Bill.
Dibbs and Parkes, according to the former,
haven’t spoken to each other for three years.
“We pass without recognition.” Good. It gives
the country a chance.
The newly-elected Messrs. Millen, Affleck,
and Ashton are already reckoned the champion
bores of N.S.W. Assembly, and the fluent vague-
ness of Atkinson Price is the terror of the Han-
sard gallery.
Set the lawyer to reform law, the doctor
physio, and Rosebery the Lords. But, says
Madame de Stael : “ No great revolution was
ever accomplished without the help of a section of
the aristocracy.”
Ex-Premier Patterson (Vic.) bids hotly for
the teetotal vote. Premier Turner, as attorney
Lyons’ partner, does most of ttie hotels’ legal busi-
ness, and has the Native vote, the Civil Service
vote, and Liquor vote.
I he ten members of the Labor-party and
Erooker, the representative of the big manufac-
turing suburb, were the only opponents of the
resolution in favour of Interprovineial Freetrade,
passed in S.A. Assembly last month,
Williams, Vic. Minister for Railways,
favors using horses instead of steam-engines on
non-paying lines. Glad news for the Melb. under-
takers, who have hitherto found it difficult to
dispose of horses worn out by hearse-work.
Apropos certain unsatisfactory decisions
of the N.S. Wales Elections and Qualifications
Committee : Why should that Committee be cotyi-
posed of politicians, necessarily partisans, and in
other respects Unfitted for an office above all
things judicial ?
Ex-Premier Dibbs longs for the days of
two parties only. “He has the old-fashioned
idea that Parliament could be carried on very
well by two parties, and that any more only
hamper the usefulness of the Government.” No
wonder. When there was practically but one
party, Parkes was Emperor of Botany Bay. The
two-party system clipped his wings, and the three-
party system burst him up. Then it burst Dibbs.
Presently it will burst Reid.
Victoria sees another deficit of £650,000
looming at the end of the financial year. Premier
Turner proposes, as a remedy, to raise £350,000
by a tax on unimproved land values, £25,000 by
an absentee-tax, and £90,000 by an income-tax,
and let the balance “slide ” for the present. Pro-
bably, however, the Council will reject the land
and absentee taxes, and, it is just possible, the
income-tax as well, and then the sow that was
washed will return to wallow in another issue of
Treasury bills, as usual.
Why was Win-
gen Abbott so
savagely ass died Ly
theN.S.W. Premier
and Sydney D.T.
for counselling non-
unionist shearers
t) arm themselves
against the union-
ists, whereas when
Justice Stephen
used still more
inflammatory lan-
guage in the same
direction at the
trial of the Gras-
mere rioters neither
journalist nor poli-
tician rose in pro-
test ? So far as the
mere exhortation to
arms is concerned
ten men would rise
at the bidding of
Stephen, J., for one
who would rise at
that of squatter Ab-
bott, and, conse-
quently, there were
ten times as many
reasonsfor denounc-
ing the judge as for
reproving the squat-
ter. Does the inci-
dent reveal still
another form of the
pervading fear of
contempt of a
Judge ?
A LOSING GAME.
FIRST UNEMPLOYED: “ Bad biz this beggiri',
Bill. You asks for bread , an’ they
gives yer a stone.”
Second Ditto: “ Naw fear; I asks fer
bread, hut I've lost two stone since I
started.”
Hume BlackV assurance that the Q.
Government will keep a register of farmers and
sugar-growers prepared to instruct pupil immi-
grants in their respective callings, is a well-studied
bid for the patronage of the “ home gentry,” who
know not what to do with their superabundant
boys.
Hardaore, M.L.A., has created a sensation
in Bananaland Parliament by declaring that there
is flourishing on the Drummond Range a
squatter unknown to officialdom, who pays no
rent, and whose squattage is mapped out in no
official records. Who?
Maoriland, after a seven years’ trial of
railway management by commissioners, proposes
to revert to the old plan of political control.
Which doesn’t prove that the commissioner
system is bad, but only that M.L. didn’t get the
right sort of commissioners.
If the display of gorgeous militarism at the
opening of Vic. Parliament does not induce the
Assembly to enact that no Vie. soldier shall be
allowed to wear scarlet, gold-braid, gilt-buttons,
feathers, or metal ornaments of any sort, an
object-lesson is simply wasted upon it.
Under the Factories Bill, now passe
through S.A. Assembly, State inspectors can
enter any factory at any time. Overcrowd-
ing and ill-ventilation are made penal, hours of
employment are limited to 48 per week, and em-
ployment of children is absolutely prohibited.
The Q. Bill raising Parliamentary salaries
from .£l5O to £250 has passed the Assembly by 31
to 28—though many of the minority only voted
against it because they knew it secure. The in-
crease will unquestionably help the Labor-party,
but the Boodlewraith tail could not longer deny
itself.
The oldest and youngest members of the
Vie. Parliament, Berry and Cook, represent W.
Bourke Boroughs. One has little to learn, haying
sat for 30 years ; the other a lot. Cook is Radical.
His father, a staunch Conservative and Free-
trader, stood for this seat years ago and lost his
deposit.
The picked escort which Q. magistrate
Parry-Okeden took to coerce the West, under the
Buckshot Act, proved more dangerous to friends
than to alleged enemies. It brought up the
measles from Brisbane and gave them to the
regular police, who have been more or less in bed
ever since.
The statement has been seasonably revived
that it was the attractiveness of the Melbourne
Cup to N.S.W. legislators, some years ago, that
led to the defeat of a then Government proposal
that N.S. Wales should join the Federal Council.
The legislative mutilators of the present week are
now being awaited.
The return to Queensland of Forrest,
M.L.0., leaves Agent-General Garrick once more
master of the situation in London. One of MTI-
- most furious threats was that he would
drive Garrick back into his Little Pe.dlington
existence; and Forrest was a means to that end.
But MTlwraithism wanes.
Theuuseating of Mr. G. H. Greene for Gren-
fell, N.S.W., on the mere ground that an official
forgot to initial and puncture the voting papers at
one booth, suggests openings for astute electioneers
to manoeuvre their friends into polling billets, and
get them to “forget” trivialities prescribed by the
Act, so as to take chances in case of a first defeat.
Czar Alexander 111. died last week of
dropsy, kidney-disease, and fright—mostly fright
—at the ever-present Nihilist spectre, his last
words, as reported by the pious cable, being, “ I
am quite prepared.” What a satire on conven-
tional religion when a Czar, with all the ghosts of
Siberia and Saghalien waiting to gibber at him on
the other side of the Styx, dies “ quite prepared ” !
The book of class-legislation as written in
the North :
I. Special legislation to give the planter cheap servile
labour.
IT, Special legislation to give him cheap State-subsidised
mills.
111. (In the near future) Special legislation to supply
manure to exhausted land and to eradicate cane disease.
IV. Pensions to all broken-down planters.
N.S.W. Govt., which last year paid Syd-
ney University .£17,000 odd as endowment, &c.,
paid also ,£l6OO fees for the students in training
for employment by the Education Department.
Considering all things, an economical Minister
for Public Instruction might have students taught
free, or know the reason why. A leech will drop
off when it is gorged, but the University seems
always greedy.
Federation, according to Chief Justice
Madden, is now much in want of someone to
argue on the other side of the question. This
great truth was announced in The Bulletin fully
a year ago. Federation makes no progress
because all parties have given in their nominal
adhesion to the principle; therefore, no party can
dish any other party by upholding it. Under the
party system—the system of Government by Con-
tradiction—the cause which has no opponent is
lost.
The Newcastle (N.S W.) coalminer is sot
down officially as earning 7s. 6d. per day. But, In
the first place, he is obliged to pay out of his 7s. 6d'
for powder, light and tools—say, ordinarily,fid.per
day ; and next, three days’ work a week Is the
estimated average of the miners during the last
two years. A miner, instead of making 455. a
week, as official figures imply, makes merely a
trifle over 20s.
There would, it is said, have been severe
retrench mint in a certain N.S.W. Govt. Depart-
TEE SWAGGIE'S TIMEPIECE.

ment had not the ex-Ministerial head, just before
leaving office, made an adroit move : he appointed
an immediate relation of an incoming Minister to
a billet in that Dept. The new Ministry could
hardly dismiss his earlier appointments without
sending off his last. Up to date there has been
no retrenchment in that Dept.
Ex-Premier Patterson (Vic.) announces
himself in favour of “leasing the railways and
reducing freights.” The Vic. railways don t pay
just now, and if any Fat Man syndicate leases
them it will naturally proceed to make them pay.
It can only do this by raising freights, or reducing
wages, or greatly increasing the hours of labour,
or, most probably, by all three combined. There-
fore Patterson’s policy is a contradiction in
terms, and another proof of the muddle-headedness
of its’ author. Also, it is 17 more reasons why
the butcher of Oastlemaine should never again be
entrusted with the destinies of anything larger
than a meat-cask.
John Willard, M.P. for the Tweed, N.S.
Wales, arrested at Brisbane charged with stealing
receipts for registered letters, etc., had things
made just as uncomfortable for him as the Govt,
knew how. He was arrested on warrant, not
charged on summons; he was arrested in the even-
ing, too late to get bail; and next day the police
opposed the granting of bail altogether. Willard,
during his Brisbane career, was a noted opponent
of Q. Govt., and helped to_ start the Democratic
Chronicle —a paper which points out Govt,
deficiencies with annoying frequency. Now
Boodlewraith has got its opponent down, and is
proceeding to jump on him with both feet.
An Adelaide journalist wrote to Melb.
Argus protesting against the idea that Lord
Rosebery was bombastic and insulting to France
in his recent allusion to “ Agincourt.” Rosebery
spoke on St. Crispin’s Day, ‘’the anniversary of
the great battle,” and what more natural than his
reference to Hingland’s glory?—asks the Jingo
correspondent. But, then, every day is the anni-
versary of an event that happened long ago, and
the event, as a rule, was something which a Prime
Minister takes particular care not to mention.
Charles the First was beheaded on January 30,
the Battle of Hastings occurred on October 14,
the date of the Battle of Bannockburn was June
25, and so forth; yet Lord Rosebery, making a
speech on either of those days, wouldn’t trot out
the British lion
The retirement of N.S.W. Railway Com-
missioner Eddy at the end of his term of engage'
ment next year will be a public misfortune, for the
odds are a kangaroo to a paddymeloii that no one
half as good and masterful will be found to take
his place. His management of the lines has earned
him the esteem of every unbiassed man in tliecoiiw

the execrations with which Ills name is greeted by
baffled boodlers. If money can persuade Com-
missioner Eddy to remain, money should not be

A REQUIEM.
Toll the bell, the Czar is dead !
Nations mourn a god departed :
Eyes of “ Germany ” are red,
“France,” alas ! is broken-hearted ;
“ Austria ” is weeping loud,
“ Hingland’s” nose is hardly drier,
“Sweden’s ” heart by grief is bowed —
Writes the babbling cable-liar.
Toll the bell! ay, let it ring, >
Drowning foolish Tory screeches,
Telling how a Russian king
Wasn’t slaughtered in his breeches.
Lucky man ! the Czar is dead,
Long by Nihilists affrighted,
Crown another in his stead,
That he may get dynamited.
Toll the bell! the people scoff,
Though it move the ruling classes,
No mad monarch’s “ popping off ”
Agitates the weary masses.
Toll the bell, for want and woe
Reigning mid those toilers serried !
Kings can come, and kings can go
Till the last be dead and buried.
New Ideas.
We have had our ages of stone and bronze and i-o
on through increasingly improved grades of
mechanical genius, and now, when people ought
to have something approaching an intelligent
acquaintance with the phenomena of their own
bodies in health and disease, we are at the end of
the century of lotions. Some dyspeptic people
have disfiguring blotches and pimples on the face,
actually resultant from an hereditary blood taint
or a partial blood poison. What else do they
expect T At any rate they attempt to destroy the
skin disease by the use of lotions and cosmetics
and alleged “ beaQtifiers,” and as these block the
pores of the skin, the result is precisely the same
as in the case of the man who shut his flood-gates
to relieve a collapsing dam. Obviously, the only
sensible and reflective way of curing a disease
resulting from blood impurities is to correct the
cause, and this Warner’s Safe Cure does. Skin
disease is not really a disease, but merely a symp-
tom of one. While you are foolishly wasting
time with local applications, which would have
just as much effect if applied to a brick wall, a
disorganised stomach is calling for assistance, or
the poisoned kidneys are crying out for Warner’s
Safe Cure. The true method of treatment in
order to secure a beautiful, clear and transparent
skin, is to keep the natural channels of the system,
or sewers which carry off the vyaste products,
perfectly free from stagnation. The natural .chan-
nel for the escape of the waste and effete products is
through the kidneys, and the only guarantee of
freedom from eruptions upon the skin is to maintain
healthy action of these organs. Nature will
accomplish what artificial means always fail to do.
Nature has her own method and her own way of
doing things. Therefore do not attempt to im-
prove upon her methods. Keep the kidneys free
from the poisons which taint the blood and produce
blotches, boils, pimples, and blemishes. Use
Warner’s Safe Cure freeljrupoh the first indication
of any roughness of the skin, and we will guarantee
that the complexion will soon be restored to a
perfect condition.
INSURING CIGARS.
A rather good story appears in the Swiss Trade
Journal, devoted to the interests of tobacco. It
appears that an ingenious, but economical smoker,
with a weakness for good cigars, purchased a
thousand of Frossard’s Oavours, and forthwith
insured them. Then he set to work to smoke
them, and, having consumed the last, demanded
750 inks, from the insurance company, on..the
.ground that the whole of the insured stock ha 1
been destroyed by fire. The court decided in his
favor, whereupon the company brought an action
for conspiracy, accused him of having intention-
ally set fire to the cigars, and obtained his com-
mittal to prison for three months. The story may
be true, or it may not. At any rate, Frossard’s
Cavour Cigars are the best value ever produced in
Australia ; they are mild and aromatic, and sold
in packets of eight for one shilling.

Let us look out for another boom of arti-
ficial “ prosperity.” This is the revolution of the
cycle—Boom ; bust ; remorse ; evangelism ; fresh
crop of hypocrites; confidence-trickeries ; boom
again. Australia is just finishing with the evan-
gelistic sowers, the fresh crop of hypocrites is
warranted to spring up like mushrooms. There
are yet some forgotten confidence-tricks to play,
and the “ mostly fools ” are just about slumbering
off again.

The Melb. spiritualists are demanding a
test-seance from the leg-shrinking Mrs. Mellon.
The same society had “ successful ” test perform-
ances from a man who afterwards went to Maori-
land with high credentials. He and his sister
used to charge from £5 to £7 a night—and get it.
He mediumised and she “led the circle.”
Spiritualists who defraud the public in Maoriland
are arrested by the police, and this was their fate.
A plain-clothes bobby struck a matcli at a seance
and clutched the medium, in whose possession was
a long strip of muslin, a bottle of phosphorised
oil and other “properties.” And of such are all
the professional “mediums.”

Investigators of “ spiritualistic ” manifesta-
tions are safe so long as their mental position
approximates that of a drinky patient to whom the
present writer once brought the late Dr. Forteseue,
of Sydney. “Well,” said the doctor, “what’s
the matter?” “ Oh, doctor,” replied the patient,
“whenever I shut my eyes a man comes and
whispers into my ear : ‘ Cut your throat, cut your
throat! ’ ” “ And do you really believe that any-
body’s there?” asked the doctor. “Oh, no,”
replied the patient, “ I know perfectly well it’s a
delusion.” “ That's all right,” remarked Dr.
Forteseue, firing into the drinky gentleman 30grs.

Apropos spiritual seances. There is
in Melb. a “ medium ” (formerly a hook-
fiend), whose Sunday night seances, at a “bob
a nob,” are opened by his greeting the audi-
ence with “ Goot eefening, fronts” (influence of a
North American Indian spook). He then prays
in common Australese. He converses with certain
spooks in broad Irish, others in Scotch, and finally
prays in a language specially understood, no
doubt, by the Supreme Being, but utterly
unknown to linguists. Then there is in Melb. a
woman medium, who trots out the Duke of Wel-
lington every Sunday night at 6d. a time, and
convinces the most sceptical that Wellington was
an illiterate boor, as he loudly commands the
British troops to “Hup, Guards, and Hat ’em ! ”
Still, the “ bobs ” and “ tanners ” roll in !

Last week The Bulletin printed a photo,
of Mrs. Mellon and her reincarnated child-spook,
“Cissie.” It will be noted that there is nothing
in the appearance of Cissie inconsistent with the
theory that the reincarnated spirit’s face is merely
a mask; which theory moreover is strengthened
by the fact that the white wrappings do not
appear to conceal a veritable human form, but
rather a clumsily-built up sort of scarecrow.

It is said that certain high judicial and
other dignitaries are forming a committee to
preside over the next Mellon test-stance. Thes
potentates intend to altogether exclude the press.
The test should soon eventuate, for several people
who have lately visited Mrs. Mellon affirm that
the lady looks as well and lively as ever,

Dear Bulletin, —Apropos your notice of
the many-titled potentates of Sydney College of
Music. A few years ago a shingle, inscribed
“Professor Blank, M.D., L.C.M.8.G.,” was
hung out in diseased Rockhampton, and the
scientist’s business was brisk until he was hauled
before the bench by the Medical Board to show
his diplomas. He had no diplomas. “Then
wlnt do your affixes mean?” asked the Bench.
It wis very simple—“ Late Curator of the Mary-
borough Botanical Gardens,” replied the indig-
nant accused. “ And, pray, what does the ‘ M.D.’
mean?” “Oh,” said the great healer, “that
means Money Down.”—L.L.

At the Mayor of Melbourne’s ball, last
week, the vice-regal set included a lady (“dressed
accordin’ ”) whose knighted husband could only
afford to pay a shilling in the £ a year or two ago.
When Mrs. Halfpenny has appeared at Fleming-
ton in a gold bonnet trimmed with clusters of
diamonds bigger than pigeon eggs, and Mrs.
Silver Mace keeps a separate kerridge and
pair for each day of the week, Melbourne will
begin to think that confidence is quite restored.
Cheek is only another name for confidence.
Dear Bulletin, —Bray, the Woolloomoo-

Hospital Saturday in Sydney —£1675;
Hospital Sunday, £264. The churches stood out
of the movement on the ground that its promoters
desecrated the Sawbath ; therefore, the saints
didn’t even take up hospital collections in their
temples. “We have the sick of our own congre-
gations to care for,” cries the Rev. Crosseye
Upturn; “ besides that, we have so manyoalls on
our charitable consideration, and the finger of
Providence has smitten the vineyards.” It was
reserved for ’94 to send parsons like Dropsytotal
Boyce complaining that hospital-canvassers defiled
the sanctity of the Sawbath, thus once more phari-
saically provoking the question ; “Is it lawful to
do good on the Sabbath-day, or to do evil ?”

In fining the publisher of Melb. Age £l5O
for contempt of Court in printing David Syme’s
famous speech, while not fining David anything
for making the speech, Judge Williams practically
decides that a statement may be quite harmless
when made verbally before a large crowd, yet
when the same statement is printed in a news-
paper it becomes altogether unlawful. In a word,
that a newspaper has less privilege than is enjoyed
by the live-meat citizen. This is still another
definition of newspaper law.

awarded plaintiff
£4OO damages. De-

new trial. “ Will

plaintiff, “ take £3OO

Hordern to harass
you with a new trial?”
Buckle demurred.
“ Well,” continued
Banco, “ we’ll grant
a new trial, but if,
within a certain
period, you agree to
knock off £lOO we’ll
quash our order.”
And so the case
stands. But if it be
lawful for Banco to
do this, what prevents
it knocking off half,

the whole of the
amount assessed by a
jury ? And what is
the use of a new
trial, if the case be
prejudged in favour
of one of the parties?
Some friends of the wife of a retired A«s-
tralian brewer recently made an afternoon call on
rat (say) Porche iter Gate. The tea-table was
adorned with a splendid gold service. When the
visitors came in of course they were asked if they
had had tea, and when one of them expressed a
desire for a cup, the lady of the house rang the
bell and said to the footman : “Joseph, bring in
the silver-service.” True Arifiifo Australian form.

The other day the newspapers recorded a
desperate hand-to-hand struggle between a valor-
ous Sydney policeman and the alleged burglar
who, it is claimed, shot watchman Ileavey ; and
that constable has, after the usual Sydney fashion
i.e., before any proper legal investigation has
been made into the facts—been promoted for his
valour, thus distinctly prejudicing the Supreme

that the constable is a man of about 25 years, who
stands 6ft., and scales 14st., whereas the arrestee

Darlinghurst warder would undertake to scruff

hoped that, in future, despite the iniquitous
examples set in recent cases, no policeman who
has engaged in “ a desperate hand-to-hand
struggle ” with an alleged enemy of the law will
be promoted until the Supreme Court has finally
dealt with the whole case.

On the morning after the terrible Redfern
railway catastrophe the S.M. Herald thus headed
its first leading article :
The shocking accident which yesterday occurred at Red-
fern railway-station has, not unreasonably, produced a
profound sensation in the city.
Could any more inane sentence be penned to ex-
press, in what poses as the leading daily paper of
the city, the sentiment of the community ? “ Not
unreasonably !” That phrase is a sort of epitome
of the flabby morale of a journal which
But we forbear. A day may come! Perhaps
when some future heir to the headship of the
house of Fairfax runs off with and marries the
stalwart and dashing cook of the “Mister James”
of the period, the resultant generation may
give the leading articles an inspiriting vim instead
of the soul-destroying phrases of white-choker-
dom.
* * *
The Redfern railway disaster and the
Wairarapa wreck were two great opportunities
for the Sydney evening papers. Both these events
came along at an hour which left the morning
papers badly in the lurch, and the journals which
cast a gloom over the lunch-hour made the very
best they knew of the opportunity. In the case of
the Wairarapa the information was exceedingly
scanty, but the Australian Star padded it out
by giving the names of the passengers in big
capitals with only one name in each line, then
a list of the drowned members of the crew,
also in big capitals with one name in each
line, and after that a complete list of the
crow—these items made a column and a-half
altogether. Also, the manifest of the ship was
published right down to sixteen rolls of matting
and some bones. Then the News went one better
by publishing the list of passengers twice over
and making three columns of them altogether,
and issuing a map of the Hauraki Gulf, and the
same old manifest right down to the matting and
the bones. Meanwhile, the morning papers were
getting ahead on the railway-accident, for whereas
the Star and News only killed one passenger and
scalded a dozen or two, the Herald and Tele-
GRAVH came out in the small hours with seven
killed, a plan of the railway line, and an article
on the appearance of the injured, whom the re-
porters had been allowed to more or less, harry in
one of the hospitals. Then the evening papers
came along again a few hours later and killed
another man, and had an inquest, and next day
the morning papers killed three more. Altogether,
it was a great time.
# * *
The dreadful Redfern railway-accident has
started the fish and gill-bird liars on another tack.
To hold everybody who claims to have been a
passenger the unfortunate train must have reached
from Sydney to Parramatta; and at least 17,000

Dear Bulletin,-
The Pastoralists’
Union, formed for the
purpose of obstructing
unionist shearers, is
just as unmoral a thing
as the Shearers’ Union,
formed to obstruct
unionist pastoralists;
but the pastoralists
don’t use filthy lan-
guage to the wives and
daughters of river-
steamer owners, nor do
they, as a rule, behave
as what the world calls
“ blackguards.” Just
after the burning of
the Rodney 50 unionist
shearers passed a hut
nearTolarno. A woman
was being confined in
the hut, and the mid-
wife asked these brutes
to have respect for
her condition. But,
although the woman
was in agonies, they
howled horrible, filthi-
nesses at her door, and
forced the midwife to
stand with a light to
show them the road
when at last they de-
cided to leave. The
majority must come on
top, but if it is such
a foul-mouthed insani-
tary majority as the
present labor mob is,
the minority, which is
simply fatheaded and
not disreputable, will
prove the better thing.

The Melb. evening Amalgam tells a touch-
ing story in connection with the wreck of the
Wairarapa. A young lady-passenger hailing from
Melbourne, before leaving the city of smells, con-
sulted two fortune-tellers who both said she was
going upon a voyage from which she would never
return. “On learning this,” says the paper, with
mulish unconsciousness, “Miss M'Kellar tried to
induce one of her sisters to make the visit.” How-
ever, Miss M’Kellar ventured and was amongst
the saved. This story is supposed to attest the
marvellous powers of the local witches, but the
point is not obvious, and The Bulletin gives the
anecdote in the interests of religion, because of
the moral it points to sisters generally.
# * *
The lesson cannot be too well learnt that
when a ship strikes on rocks and the masts
do not go at the first shook, they are likely
to be the last things left standing—if the ship
is firmly fixed. So the Wairarapa passengers
found, while those who trusted to the bridge—
an exposed structure comparatively slightly sup-
ported and offering a large surface to the leverage
of the waves—were swept away along with it.

When the R.C. Church means business it
would scorn to adopt the canting subterfuges of
its Protestant rival. Outside St. Patrick’s Cathe-

announcing in white letters, on a bright blue
ground, an Art Union for the benefit of the build-

the eye of speculative Christianity can feast upon
those tempting figures—£2ooo. As soon as Union
No. 1 has filled the clerical Tatt. will open
another sweep, probably.
Further, the Archbishop desires that the goods
at the fair shall represent something approxi-
mating solid value for cash, and that the sales-
women will give the public a chance to escape
buying the things they don’t want. Most im-
portant point of all, the Archbishop—mindful,
perhaps, of those poor johnnies who took tea in
Nellie Stewart’s tent—exhorts the young ladies to
“return the full amount of change.”
The Rev. Father addressed
his flock from the altar and said
that he had arranged to pur-
chase five new sets of vest-
ments. “ You, Dinis M'Oarty,
will pay for wan, Timothy
Hehir will pay for another,
Michael O’Flynn will pay for
the thurrd, and the parish will
pay for the remaining two. Oi
may say that Oi’ve got them
chape, as I bought them from
Sydney direct.” Which artless
admission reached the ears of
the local sergeant, who had for
months been waging a fierce
feud with his Riverence, and
he at once scented a smuggle.
It was customary from time to
time to make certain transfers
of nuns from the Yio. to the
Sydney side of the Murray,
and these, it appeared, had
been made the saintly means of
effecting the smuggle. His
Riverence was taxed with it,
genially admitted everything,
next Sunday announced to
Dinis M’Carty, Timothy Hehir,
Michael O’Flynn and the parish
that the cost of the vestments
would be increased to the ex-
tent of a £5O fine and £l3 duty.
And that is said to be the true
story of that village priest and
his vestments.
* * m
The offence of that priest
was, in the immortal words of
Abigail, “ more popery than
fiscal.”

The recent Vie. seizure
of clerical vestments for import
duty was paralleled a few years
ago in one of the South Sea
islands. Deputy-Commissioner
Romilly bailed up a French
priest’s impedimenta at Rotumah and demanded
duty. “ Mais, monsieur,” cried the priest as each
article was tallied, “c’est pour Dieu.” “I asked
mm at last,” narrates Romilly, “if a hhd. of
was ‘ pour Dieu’ and received the reply,
Mais, oui, c’est tout pour Dieu.’ ” But Romilly
exacted his duty.
Lives there a daily pressman who could
write a column on Melb. Cup without abasing
himseff before “Mr. Skinner’s Luncheon?”

ent creatures; but all the while a lot of ’em are
merely the creatures of Skinner or any other
person who provides them with a bit of “cold

As usual, Yic. gubernatorial party, includ-
ing a spindle-shanked and hairv-kneed Cale-

depths of “loyalty” Victorians must wallow in
when they slobber over the “dear Countess” who,
on all occasions, takes no pains to conceal her
contempt for them! “I hate fashionable Vic-
torians,” wrote Francis Adams, “they’re such
snobs—they’re worse than English people.”

Rev. John Fordyce’s self-denying ordin-
ance, promulgated before the Congregational
Union, not to start a church in any locality in
Australia where any Christian church is already
at work, may not be sound doctrinally, but is,
from a business point of view, most sensible. A
moderate living for one parson means straits for
two and starvation for three, with the outcome of
extermination for all. The country newspaper
press should study Pastor Fordyce’s ordinance.
Business men in general should give it a thought.
But, doctrinally, does it not mean—first make
sure of your living ; then propagate your dis-
tinctive creed ?

Poor old Fitz-Gibbon, of Melbourne, has
met with a new disaster. Another Fitz-Gibbon
has arisen, in Calcutta, to state that his (the Cal-
Photo, by Falk Studios] [Sydney.

cutta man’s) elder brother is the real “White
Knight of Kerry,” and that the Melbourne
Gibbon has no claim to the title whatsoever. So
far as can be gathered from much infuriated Irish
correspondence on the subject, the original white
knight, or “ Mac-an-L’san Riddery,” came from
the Fitz-Gibbon branch of the Desmond
Geraldines, and was killed by the Mao Oarthy
More at Kenmare, and buried at Ardfinnan,
leaving a widow named Norah Ny Connor.
Thereafter the story vanishes into a mist
of genealogy, through which can be faintly
descried here and there the huge hairy
legs and battleaxes of old caterans named
Malaohi Hoolan or Cornelius M'Dermott,
who belabored each other furiously among the
bogs in days of old. These individuals seem to
have pounded each other out of shape through
four centuries, and at the end of that period they
all died, and the direct line of the White Knights
became extinct, and thereafter Fitz-Gibbon’s ances-
tors and the ancestors of the rival Gibbon both
claimed the barren distinction, and they seem to
have died and been buried in Galway amid the
general grief of all the adjacent Hooligans and
O’Donnells without ever coming to a definite
settlement. Irish genealogy is an interesting
study when you don’t get too much of it at once.
The Bulletin trusts that the Melb. Fitz-Gibbon
will prevail in the present controversy. It would
be refreshing to know for certain that one Aus-
tralian knight was really “white.”

The Y.M.C.A. Hall, Bourke-st., Melb.
(original cost, .£55,000), has passed into the
possession of the Harmy for the sum of £19,000,
and the good young men are out in the cold. No
institution in Melbourne is so typical of the spirit
of the boom as the Y.M.C.A., but its members
and leaders mistook the boom for the Grace of
God.

The Argus having resolved to reduce its

loudly proclaimed
that, should the ap-
pointment be made,
residents would with-
draw their children
from school. But the
Education Board put
its foot down, and
threatened to close
the place summarily
in case of any such

G. M‘K.; Mr. Henry’s action in grabbing the so-called
ghost at the Sydney spiritualistic seance and demon-
strating the fraud which was being worked was decidedlv
vigorous and unconventional, but it was no more
“ brutal” or wicked than is the action of the surgeon
who extirpates a cancer. Nor was Mr. H. guilty of any
“ breach of private hospitality,” for the affair was public
in that reporters had been invited to attend (and aid
in bamboozling the public as on previous occasions). In
helping to smash the idea that people can conjure up and
commune with the ghosts of their dead, Mr. Henry has
performed an inestimable public service «nd kept out of
the lunatic asylums many people who were trembling on
the borderland of insanity Mesach: The Bulletin had
no “pecuniary interest” in “ relentlessly opposing " the
Colo Valley grab. The Bulletin’s opposition to that big
reach-out was simply inspired by the fact that the wire-
pullers most prominently engaged therein were nearly all
wild-eyed Single-taxers who, after ranting for years and
years about the absolute necessity of conserving for the
people the “natural opportunities” of the land, and so
on, took the very first chance to convulsively clutch for
themselves and gang the “ natural opportunities ” of the
Colo Valley. The sight of that local-preacher-looking
aggregation of lobbyists night after night in the Parlia-
mentary vestibules and passages was too much for Tub
Bulletin’s liver. Look here: If a Melbourne band of
company-promoters can hope to make a few hundreds of
thousands by turning over the Colo water-rights in the
London market, why shouldn’t the Government market
those rights and dump the proceeds into the Treasury ?

Sydney, 6th November, 1894.
Derby Day at Fleminyton.
The V.R.O. Spring meeting, writes “ Sappho
Smith,” opened auspiciously at Flemington, last
Saturday, with the Derby, when the big race-
course was just comfortably crowded. Though
the back-blockers are always in Melbourne some-
time beforehand, they rarely break the sporting
ice until Cup day, so that the Derby is always a
pleasant, sit-down sort of festival, to which one
can confidently wear one’s pinchiest shoes in the
blissful certainty of being able to find a seat.
Flemington looked very lovely on Saturday. The
lawn grass was long and fresh, and the Flem-
ington flowers had made a special effort for the
occasion.
There was quite an overpowering show of vice-
regality on the box-seat, so to speak. Lady
Hopetoun looked altogether fetching in a pinky
silk, completely covered in cream chiffon, with
aecordeon-pleated sleeves and small rosettes of
pink. A floral toque of forget-me-nots, with a
wide-awake pink rose and a cream silk parasol,
completed a neat turn-out.
Lady Duff wore salmon pink and a black toque,
and looked even more weary than usual. Lady
Norman and Lady Glasgow sported raopoke hues,
out of compliment to the defunct Czar, ’twas said.
As both these ladies had to travel some distance
to the Cup, it seemed rather ghoulish of them to
pack up a weeping frock apiece, in cold blood,
so as to be prepared for the monarch’s death
during Cup week. Apropos of the Czar, I have
just heard tell of of a Victorienne whose husband
had once suffered and recovered from the Imperial
complaint (lucky man !) and who wrote, offering
her services to the Royal invalid. “I have nursed
my husband through it, and am more qualified to
nurse His Majesty than anybody,” wrote this
modest Melbourne matron, who doubtless expected
to return crowned with laurel as the Duchess of
Komskikoff.
Quite a scurry of vice-regal maidens helped to
cram the Governor’s box. Miss Grace Norman,
wore a strawberries-and-crearn frock ; Miss Kate
and Miss Heather Duff, fawn and pink and
bright yellow respectively ; Miss M. Bowden
Smith had a floral gown with pink braces. But
I offend official etiquette in mentioning these
damsels before admiringly chronicling the success
of Lord Hopetoun’s new spring toilet of the
palest shade of tabby-cat grey, gloves and hat en
suite, and tricky boutonniere of saffron rosebuds.
Gov. Kintore, who looks less and less like a
blue-ribbon disciple every year, sported iron-grey
with such a faded buttonholer that it looked like
a gage d'amour. Lord Glasgow, Viscount Gor-
manston, and Gov. Duff were the rest of the
social rulers on view.
Sydneyites wore rather weak in point of num-
bers on Derby Day. Mrs. James Aberoorn White
wore a black moire gown with three albescent
plumes in her bonnet. Mrs. Tom Slattery sported
blue and white checked silk with fal-de-rals of
black chiffon and jet. Mrs. Walter Hall wore
blue and white checked silk with cornflowers in
her bonnet ; Miss Burdekin was airy in floral
muslin fixed with green and pink silk; Miss
Marcia Cox wore hailstone muslin and a leghorn
hat trimmed with crimson roses, and Miss Felicia
Manning wore a neat grey suit.
I discovered a new male boutonniere—an adorn-
ment a span across of small strawberries and
leaves. It suggested dessert. Cyril Tyler turned
up at the Derby ; the man who photo’d him in a
surplice with his eyes turned heavenwards and a
big hymn-book ought to have seen the little
cherub in shooting knickerbockers, with an eye
like a hawk, getting the latest scratchings in his
race-book.
Taking Derby dressing, lock, stock and barrel,
I can’t say I made many sartorial discoveries.
The very newest things were the Infinitesmal
u nbrellas—long, thin gamps with a tricky bow
on the handle, folding up as small as a cane.
Nellie Stewart, attended by Mr. Musgrove (with
a beauty-spot on his neck) and a chaperone, wore
a new combination of biliously green checked silk,
with a cavalier collar of butter-color lace and
aggravations of black chiffon and jet. I liked
Mrs. George Chirnside’s trappings as well as any
—cream figured silk gauze over white silk, and a
black Hamlet hat. Mrs. Rupert Clatke, in butter-
fly-colors, was a startling contrast to the rest of
the family, who wore mourning, of course.
Writes “Van M.”
The woman who did not look her best on Derby -
day had only herself or her modiste to thank.
Mother Nature, in benignant mood, bestowed
bright sunshine, blue skies, soft, unparched grass—
a perfect setting for a costume pageant.
However, even literary tourists, those critical
Snarley Yows, allow that the “colonial female”
has a successful, if somewhat gay, knack of dress-
ing, and this year’s racegoers have, so far, not
belied their reputation. Saturday’s gowns were
cool and pretty, the light summer silks being, in
my opinion, the most effective. A silk has a
dainty dignity all its own, not attainable by the
most ambitious orepon or cotton, and yet, in soft,
spring tints, looks innocent and virginal enough
for the robe of a newly-materialised angel.
The Govt. House contingent arriving at Flem-
ington, with the usual trimmings of postillions
and outriders, looked enviably festive dismount-
ing and trooping into the vice-regal box, which,
in a society novel, would thereafter have re-
sounded with the mirth and silvery laughter of
the highborn company. Youth at the prow and
pleasure at the helm, and all that sort of thing,
don’cher know. But fact, generally speaking, is
duller than fiction, and on this occasion the cre-
tonne draperies of the holy of holies, most of the
time, rustled only to the mild chit-chat of a hen-
convention, the men-folk merely dropping in
officially, so to speak. Certainly, the ladies were
led forth in turn for walking exercise, the matrons
by their Excellencies, the maidens by “the
suites.” Still, this dissipation notwithstanding,
the feminine share of the vice-regal outing bore
any aspect but that of mad revelry.
There were exceptions, of course, to the general
chaos of dullness. Melbourne’s vice-regal dame
was in her usual good racing form, which doesn’t
imply that she hugged the society of her own sex
any more closely than usual; while a pretty girl
in salmon-pink, said to be a relative of Lord Kin-
tore, also had a gay time, though quite indepen-

usual, everyone was crying out about Gov.
Robinsons ‘splendid face. But people always

you’ve composed a song or made any kind ot a

I hasten to lay meed of admiration at the shrine
of the Sydney pro-consul, on the ground that at
all events, he can’t be mistaken for an unusually
well-grown and prosperous actor,
A potentate who broke the monotony of the
vice-regal tableaux was a stout patriarch garbed
according to the methods of a superannuated
Dissenting Shepherd. His baggy black coat, gone-
over pants, and hat pressed well down on his
good baldhead, were so genially regardless of
appearances that he soon became as popular with
outsiders as he appeared to be with the ladies of
his own party.
Among the throng were Mrs. Rupert Clarke, in
blue silk and chiffon, her hat ablaze with carna-
tions; Miss Manning, daughter of the Sydney
Mayor, having a very quiet time in a grey tailor-
made costume; Mrs. Walter Coldhain, sweet and
tresh, in silver-grey silk. Pretty wives, like
other blessings, run in families. The clan which
has been fortunate enough to annex the last-raen-
tioned lady can boast of equally attractive
matrons, in all its scattered branches,
Mrs. George Chirnside’s white silk and grena-
dine was almost too colorless for its pale wearer ;
w },ile the bright yellow gown, worn by the hand-
some or jgi na i 0 f a portrait in the “Victorian
Artists,” went to the other extreme, almost
dazzling one with its brilliancy. Miss Madden
and her sister were not,at their best in limp floral
muslins, which, though becoming enough to the
f a j rj girlish faces of the wearers, were sadly lack-

SPORTING NOTIONS.
The Bulletin doesn’t attempt to explain why
j tg Melbourne Cup lip didn’t come off, save by remarking
that it is the peculiarity of such tilings not to come off.
A i ip being, therefore, merely an evidence that the horse
mentioned won’t win, Tub Bulletin s tip, by not coming
f rom (.Jjg betting latterly, and might probably be des-
cribedas a 40 to 1 chance, was the winner. Devon (50
to 1) was second; Nada (l6 to 1), third. The only gleam
l°y the business is that this paper announced that
Devon would he second or third, and he was second.
which was such a surprising case of accuracy that the
writer of the par will feel inflated about it for many days.
* » • •
In 34 Melbourne Cup races only seven favorites
have got home. Among the winners one started at 100
to 1 ; three at 50 to 1; one at 40 to 1 ; two at 33 to 1; three
at 20 to 1; one ;at 18 tol; two at 16 to one; one at 14 to
I; one at 12 to 1: and four at 10 to 1. Which makes
n ; ne t een rank-outsiders among thirty-four winners.
Therefore, The Bulletin rises up after the event like the
voice of one in the wilderness who looks the stable door
upon that mill which will never grind with the water that
is past, and gives the following infallible recipe for spot-
ting a Cup winner: Write each horses name on a piece
of paper: put all the papers on the verandah-sill in the

upon,

The A.J.O. Derby is losing its old reputation
foThe £. oTAmSoCtSeS
year-old champions at Randwick could be reckoned the
best horses of their year, or something very near it. The
experiences of 1893 and’94 have been sad for punters who
tried to pick the V.R.C. hero from Sydney “form.
People will argue that Cobbity, who ran third to Bonnie
Scot i and aQ( j ohesterman in September, would have won
the Blue Ribbon on Saturday (barring the accident which
him in his stable), inasmuch as he was supposed to
be faster than Malachite at a mile. Cobbity, however,
was not tried with Malachite over Derby distance, and
time will probably prove him to be inferior to his under-
JMft KieTeD
on g a t urda y j j n that case we should have seen au A.J.C.
Derby winner, for the second year in succession, beaten
out of a place at Flemington.
_ " _ * . , ’. v t?
s Kls assumed by the writer of these
no t, es but Dreamland’s expected improvement between
Caulfield and Flemington meetings was all dream and
no “ land.” The favorite had got rid of some flesh in
the meantime, and a little of his pace had gone with it,
perhaps. One is forced to the conclusion that Dream-
land, if he was really as good as Scobie supposed three
mon > fcha haß been radica ii y affected by the strangles.
The disease, as a rule, leaves a vague, uncertain kind of
weakness behind it. A horse recovers from strangles to
about the same extent that a man gets ov«r an attack of
influenza.
‘ ‘ * . ' .* ,
Some Derby stories have it that Harvester and
Malachite interfered with the chance of the favorite much
more than they trouWed one another. Be that as it may.
Dreamland, running the race over again under the same
jookeyship conditions, would need good luck to get
through with less jostling than he suffered on Saturday.
Power held a splendid position when the field had gone a
f , bufc his ho rse soon dropped back nearly last, and
aeemed ’to be in the thick of them all the time that he was
making a j 0 ng run towards the front. Coming down the
B traight Dreamland was more or less done, whilst the
horse with the most rush left in him was the one that
ultimately took the prize.
One, at least, of the advertising tipsters gave
Arihi as a “good thing ” for the Maribyrnong Plate. As
regards Mr. Wilson’s two lengthy youngsters, Challenger
and Wallace, the stable was out of its reckoning that
Wallace could beat the penalised colt at even weights,
\yjt, b the extra 101 b. off his back Challenger would have
flushed second, anyway.
......
The Bulletin “ tip ” of Carnage for the Mel-
bourne Cup looked very queer after that good horse gone
wrong had made his irritating display in the Stakes.
With Carnage it was a case of first he would, and then he
wouldn’t, gallop. Then Gough gave him one or two
goun{ j w haoks with the whip, and for a moment the can-
tankeroue animal looked really dangerous, but there was
no iU spioion of brilliancy about his finish. By Saturday,
too, it was pretty generally known that members of the
Wilson party favours* Nada’s ohanoe, and had told their
frienda to leave last year’s Darby winner alone—“havi
nothing to do with him,” was the advice.
• * • •
Teddy Keys’s idea of satisfactory sweep “at*
rangement ” is hair-raising, if rumor tells truth.
» * • *
The Australasian, with all its opportunities
for obtaining “information,” named 18 horses for the six
races on Saturday, without putting a name to one winner.
* * * *
Carnage—he looks very handsome, and is, more-
over, in good, if not hard, condition —has developed a
vice which necessitates the performance of a mysterious
rite by the trainer before he can run for a race. This
secret was kept close, like all St. Albans secrets, until
Saturday, but it became common property after Munro
was seen handling Carnage in a particular way. The
most surprised persons on the ground were three ladies,
who came along to see the finishing touches put to “dear
Carnage.” They soon beat a discreet retreat.
» * » ♦
Although the V.R.O. stewards took four hours
to consider the Derby protest, there was no public objec-
tion to The Harvester’s victory. Among those who saw
the mSl6e, the majority considered that Malachite had
chiefly benefited by it. Dreamland’s jockey was forced
to stop riding for two or three seconds, and Bonnie Scot-
land received a buffet. But seeing that the other three
horses were “ collaring ” Bonnie Scotland at the time, Mr,
Gollan’s complaint went for very little.
• ♦ • •
Ruenalf won the Melbourne Stakes in 2min.
lOJseo., Patron carried 9st. into second place, and Carnage
was “ nowhere.” Last year Carnage won the Spring
Stakes over the same course in 2min. lOisecs., beating
Patron. The two young three-year-olds then carried 9st.
filbs. If the time test is to be taken as a guide, Carnage,
bested by both Patron and the clock, must have deterio-
rated at least 211bs. in “ form.”

Byron Moore, secretary Y.R.C., much to the
disgust of a crowd of other hangers-on, has expunged the
names of 192 bogus pressmen who in former years got
free press-tickets for the four days’ racing. It’s scarcely
creditable, but one mean Canadian had for years got
press-box tickets for Vic. race meetings as representative
of Arizona Kicker ! Another travelled as the Colorado
Clarion —both alleged papers being mere myths, invented
by certain ’Murkan humorists. This meeting, anyhow,
genuine pressmen are allowed to see something from the
press-box at Flemington.

The starting-machine will take 15 per cent, off
starter Watson’s lease of purgatory. It will enable him
to presently swear off swearing. On Saturday, for pro-
bably the first time in the world, the manner of a start
was rapturously applauded. The Derby horses left the
line like automata, haunch to haunch and neck to neck.
The lawn and hill and flat clapped honest admiration, a
thing seldom known on a racecourse.

W. Brockwell, Stoddart’s star bat, represents
an English sporting paper on the Australian tour.
♦ * * ♦
Major Ben. Wardill, of Melb., went to Adelaide
to meet Stoddart’s team and was the hero of a very
“happy” speech made at the reception. Said Ben.,
“ We asked Stoddart to bring eight amateurs and five pro-
fessionals and we would have done them, by gad ; but he
has brought five amateurs and eight professionals and
they’ll do us, by gad I”
* * * *
Stoddart’s team look better in the flesh than
they do on paper. The remarkable thing about them is
their average height. Leaving out Briggs and Peel, they
are all six-footers. Humphreys is stout, grey haired, and
middle-aged, and will hardly be equal to continuous work.
Ford, the hitter, is about as tall as Bonnor and as thin as
Bruce. Brockwell, Albert Ward, and Richardson are all
big, powerful fellows and just the sort of men for a heavy
trip. Brockwell will be the success of the tour on his
form at practice ; but Ford, who is a left-hander and hits
hard, will be as popular with the public as “Billy” Bruce,
simply because the public love batsmen far removed from
the genus stonewaller. J. T. Brown, the Yorkshireman,
Albert Ward (Lancashire) and Brockwell (Surrey) are all
splendid safe bats, and will, with Stoddart, do most work.
All the team have a high opinion of Richardson’s bowling
and expect great things from the Surrey demon.
* » • •
The sensation of this English Eleven’s visit
may be the lob-bowling of Humphreys. We have never
had a real lob-bowler here, and Humphreys (now about
46 years old) has more than once played the deuce with
the peers of Australian batsmen.
* » * *
Stoddart’s amateurs and pros, keep up the old
obnoxious English tradition by staying at different hotels.
♦ ♦ ♦ ♦
Brown, of Stoddart’s team, is said to be the
finest “point” in the world—better even than Shrewsbury
or Walter Read.
* • * •
The present English team has more young
bloods than previous teams from “ ’ome,” and headed by
Stoddart they are the most dashing batsmen that have
visited Australia. Peel and Humphreys are their only
slow scorers, and for the Britishers to be all day at the
wickets means over 300 runs. In their first match against
the Gawler (S.A.) 18 they put up 368 runs—a great day’s
score against any 18.

Editor Bulletin, —You say bookmakers have
to live. Yes, but not by giving odd* that are grossly un-
fair. I backed Devon for the Caulfield Cup and only got
20 to 1 about him from one of the best-known Melb. book-
makers. The day the ticket was dated the horse was
quoted at 100 to 1£ i n the Aas, and he was never less than
33 to 1. I was glad to see your remarks re Paris running
in Caulfield Stakes. A small owner would have had to
explain to the stewards.—Caradoc, Mildura.

Writes “Victor":—The Harvester, much to
my surprise, has repeated The Admiral trick for Mr. Sam.
Cook ; had, however, Cobbity not been cast in his box the
Derby, I firmly believe, would have, through his instru-
mentality, been credited to Mr. Lloyd.
Weeks ago I informed Bulletin readers that
the chestnut son of Aberoorn could “ run rings ” round
Malachite, who, but for the bumping about he got some
250yds. from home, should have won. What a moral,
then, the Derby would have been for Cobbity 1 However,
might, could and would don’t count.
It is just on the cards that Dreamland has been
ruined for racing purposes by his hurried preparation.
He is but a big baby, and till five years of age “ the
shelf ” should be his position.
Moorite, who will yet prove himself the best of
his age, was judiciously scratched for the Derby. He
wants time, and, though he improves every day, it was
found impossible to send him to the post in Derby condi-
tion.
Gale ran lbs. below his true form in the Mari-
byrnong Plate, for, after looking all over a winner, he
suddenly collapsed. This son of Nautilus will yet turn
out a “hummer'” or I’m much mistaken. Challenger
will also see a better day.
Euroka, judging by his running into third place
behind Ruenalf and Escapade at Randwick, and The
Harvester and Malachite at Caulfield, is a likely winner of
something ere the week’s out.

AUSTRALIAN MUTUAL PROVIDENT
SOCIETY.
That another year is now drawing to a close is
brought forcibly before us by the advertisement of
the Australian Mutual Provident Society, which
appears in another column, reminding those who
are contemplating life assurance that the next
division of profits will take place as at 31st.
December next, and that all policies issued before
that date will participate therein. According to
the liberal conditions of that popular Society, a
policy now issued, and upon which a yearly pre-
mium has been paid, will be entitled to a full
year’s bonus at the end of the year. If the pre-
mium be paid half-yearly, then a half-year’s bonus
will be added, and so on. All bonuses vest imme-
diately a policy has been in force two years. The
amount of cash bonus divided for the year 1893
was nearly half-a-million sterling.
According to Turner, Ferris was never employed

The latest race-dream, Webb, editor of S.A.
Chkokiclb, lately dreamt that he applied to the Delphio
Oracle for the “ double '* for Caulfield and Melb. Cups.
He was told toget the nomination lists and, laying his ear
to each paper in succession, pass it along from the bottom
to the top under promise that the winner in each case
would pronounce its own name. This he did, and from
each list came distinctly the desired word. But, when he
woke up, though all the rest of the dream was clear and
he remembered that “ the double” had been told him, he
could not call the names to mind. The greatest trouble
of all is that he firmly believes the Oracle spoke truly.

In the West,
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
In the Land of Broken Promise, where the peace-
ful Darling flows,
And the rough and roving shearer, like a pilgrim,
yearly goes,
Where the roaming cattle wander, and the woolly
legions stray,
Now the gay and dashing trooper goes a-prancing
all the day.
For upon the lonely Darling, where the squatter
o’er his bales
Measures out the shearer’s portion with the old,
unequal scales,
Now the rough-and-ready shearer, with a dreadful
swear has sworn
In a warm and vivid diction, that he’ll never more
be shorn.
And his snipping shears are silent, with signi-
ficance profound,
While the fierce and sullen shearer’s prowling
moodily around,
And, like crows that scent the powder, all the
carrion blacklegs fly
From the deadly danger lurking in the corner of
his eye.
For his soul has waxed impatient as spring leaves
the wattle-gum,
And he yearns to send the blackleg to the realms
of Kingdom Come;
From the Darling flashing daily come grim mes-
sages of war,
Of the blazing hut and woolshed, and the shearer
steeped in gore.
Stalwart shearer, free and careless ! on thy hot,
impatient head
Fall like thunderbolts rebounding all thy whistling
balls of lead.
And the flame thou madly kind lest, by the breath
of bias fanned,
Forges but another weapon for the stronger hostile
hand.
Thou shalt profit by the lesson, yet thy learning
comes full late
That thy best and surest weapon is the strength
to watch and wait.
And beware thou, too, O shearer of the Darling,
blackleg-curst,
Lest thou answer at the calling of the roll in
Darlinghurst.
And before another season, go thou, shearer, and
repent
Of thy little faults and failings, and the cheques
so rashly spent;
Little dreamed you, little recked you, of the potency
of “ grub,”
When the rum was freely flowing in the Lamb-
down wayside “pub.”
Then, with'all thy forces marshalled, larder full
and idle shears,
Thou shalt face the foe in triumph and mayst
take him by the ears,
Till he lieth down before thee like the meek and
lowly lamb,
Though his inward salutation will be probably a
“ d n !”
And the tardy gates of justice then shall open
swing once more,
And you’ll stand again triumphant, full within
the temple door;
For the bolts, though long unyielding, yet they
open at a price,
When the hungry gods are greedy for the annual
sacrifice.
W.B.M.
According to the cable, London Times
urges that Britain should negotiate a new com-
mercial treaty with Japan, giving the Japanese, in
return for the free admission of British products,
entry to the colonies on the same basis as
Europeans. In other words, the Times proposes
that Britain should get certain valuable trading
privileges from Japan, and that the Japs should
have, as compensation, the right to ruin the labor
market of Australia. It was probably the bril-
liant Miss Flora Shaw who conceived this great
idea in the way of one-sided reciprocity. It seems
hardly possible that any other “colonial autho-
rity ” could be quite so genially fatuous and
obtuse.
Paddy M‘Caughan, of the Melb. “ Rialto,”
departed for Coolgardie the other day in a mar-
vellous costume, of the kind usually built for
amateur Alpine tourists. Togs are Paddy’s
supreme weakness at all times, but his Coolgardie
disguise beats the gaudy speculator’s previous
record in a trot. The possibilities of travel and
adventure expressed by that brand-new get-up are
beyond human calculation. A party of friends,
whom Paddy called together for the purpose of
beholding him “ with ’em all on ” and wishing him
bon voyage, agreed that the knickerbockers alone
were equal to 15 journeys round the world. They
also considered that hostile natives would fall
paralysed before Paddy’s lawless head-gear.
Dear Bulletin, — Be “tight places.” A
workless miner at Eaglehawk, some years ago,
thought to pick up the run of stone in a certain
abandoned shaft, and, without telling anyone of
his intentions, proceeded to explore the old work-
ings. He had delved in the adjoining mine, but
had never been in the one he was now going to
“fossick.” Climbing down to the 400-feet level,
candle-in-hand, he explored crosscuts and drives,
and scrambled down winzes; but, in jumping a
bit of a “lump,’’ the jolt put his candle out and,
to his dismay, he found he hadn’t a match to re-
light it. As an old miner he should have told
his wife where he was going, in case of accident;
and, of course, he was to blame for not seeing to
his “ strikes” ere going down. It is to his credit
that he did not lose his presence of mind. That,
as he afterwards said, would have meant death
for certain. Crawling on hands and knees, and
keeping straight ahead, he went the fearful
journey slowly, but surely, down the “pass,”
through the drives, out in the crosscuts, in a dark-
ness that could be felt, and in an hour he reached
the shaft—to see the small circle of light 400 feet
overhead. To this day I have never seen him
strike a match if anyone was striking one to light
a pipe, or if a fire was handy. “Matches are
precious, my lad, I can tell you.”— Willow Tea.

A beautiful story of Christian presence of
mind comes from St. Paul’s Cathedral (Melb.).
The father of one of the chief chorister-boys, after
repeatedly expressing scorn for the- loose official
management of boy matters in general, told his
offspring to bid the organist farewell, and leave
word for his masters and pastors that he wouldn’t
be allowed to praise Heaven any more under the
Cathedral roof. The boy did as directed, after
singing at Dean Macartney’s funeral. He gave
the tabernacle five minutes’ warning, and went
back to the care of his wicked parents to bette r
himself. When the reverend precentor became
convinced that the missing lamb was really off for
good, he consulted the Cathedral Chapter-he
couldn’t consult the Dean for obvious reasons.
Two days later the father of the chorister who
had (under parental instructions) “chucked” the
blessed Chapter received a letter, announcing that
the Chapter felt compelled to dispense with the
emancipated warbler’s services, in consequence
etc. Which was tantamount to, say, Patterson
rising in the Vic. Assembly to state that he had
decided upon the dismissal of his vanished
Ministry.

With an ordinary tape measure determine the width
round the joints AA, round the instep 88, round heel CO,
round the ankle DD ; next ascertain the length and width
of tread by placing the foot on a sheet of paper, and
running a lead pencil round the heel and toes. Cut the
outline thus made with a scissors, and enclose with the
other measurements, stating what size you generally take,
what are your peculiarities—a weak ankle, perhaps a pet
corn, ingrowing nails, or a blooming bunion. All thsss
little matters attended to, if you have a long thin foot, or
a short thick one, with very high instep, send to ELLIS’S,
where you are sure to get a fit. The proprietor, with a
view of introducing his new and simple system into the
country districts where practical boot making is unknown,
has decided to supply bis patrons at the lowest cash price.
POST FREE TO ANY PART OF AUSTRALIA.
No matter how tar in the interior you reside, ELLIS’S
system has already proved a sovereign balm to thousands
of country residents who, whilst performing their daily
avocations, had previously to endure the excruciating
tortures of narrow-fitting and shapeless foot gear, the
insoles of which fairly bristle with tacks and other un-
comfortable impedimenta. All boots made on specially-
constructed lasts, giving the foot an ample tread,
and consequently comfort. You can WEAR ELLIS’S
BOOTS STRAIGHT AWAY-they are a “going con-
cern ” from the start. The materials are well tanned, and
will not “draw” or blister the feet, as most new boots
do. Send for catalogue, post free. The following

Kangaroo, E.S. or Shoes, 14s 6d, 15s 6d, 16s fid, 17s 6d ;

On a certain Australian diggings was a
miner who had “ God strike me blind 1 ” con-
tinually on his tongue. One night, playing
Yankee-grab, he so sickened his mates with the
phrase that, when he fell asleep, they planned a
fright for him. When he showed signs of waking
they put the lights out and went on shaking and
counting, as if still playing, until from the sofa
came a horrified voice—“ God strike me blind, if
He hasn’t gone an’ done it 1 ”
Wool and Produce Reports.
M'Bdrnby, Wallis and Oo.’s Report.— At our wool sale
to-day competition was very keen, but prices cannot be
quoted any higher than last auctions. The low rates now
ruling are being accepted by growers as the only reason-
able alternative open to them, and consequently we were
able to clear our catalogue, with the exception of two
bales, which we protected up to our valuation by passing
in. The outlook in the immediate future is still very
gloomy, and we think growers will gain nothing by holding.
The London market is no better than our own, and consider-
ing that it costs about IJd. per lb. to ship and sell in Lon-
don, we would strongly advise our friends to make the best
of the bad times and sell in Sydney. Among the clips we
sold were the following; FG, a well got up clip from The
Rock, at 6Jd. ; DY, from same district, at 6Jd. ;
TP/DUBBO, a nicely-grown wool, at 6Jd. ; AP/New Eng-
land, a nice free wool, at 6Jd.; P over —/Temora, at6Jd.;

Professor TODD, Anderson’s College Medical

munication on his part to Messrs. Bosisto & Co.,
writes :
It is a lighter, clearer, and more ethereal oil than any
I have hitherto used, besides being free from the heavy
nauseous odour characteristic of others.
This is particularly noticeable when the oil is sprayed
into the throat.
It is very palatable when taken internally, which places
it above other preparations, and considerably enhances its
value.

Song: By the Tarra.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
The light from sunset hill a-waning,
A low wind in the trees complaining
(The rippling river gleams along) ;
The golden day so hardly dying,
Gold shafts across the water lying,
The rustling reeds’ reluctant sighing
(The wandering river sings its song).
The bells of evening, rising, falling,
The sad-voiced plover’s plaintive calling
(The ruddy ripples glance along);
Far bells from out the city ringing.
And distance-mellowed voices singing,
Faint memories of the past are bringing
(The waters dancing on and on).
But, hark ! the last bell tolling, tolling,
The darkening water rolling, rolling
(The sullen ripples opening on) ;
A new-born moon, cloud-pillowed, dreaming,
And faintest star-shine gleaming, gleaming
To stars beneath the tide-way seeming
(The unseen river glooms along).
Low in the east a pale moon brightening,
Low in the west the cloud-wrack lightening
'(The humming water lapses on) ;
The solace of the night comes stealing,
Its balm and bliss afresh revealing
To sad hearts, sick for nature’s healing
(The silver ripples foam along).
So, too, our lives are flowing, flowing,
To the deep ocean onward going
(As runs the river ceaselessly);
On Time’s unresting currents shifting,
By moon or sun or starlight drifting,
To the fierce tide-race tossing, lifting
The drowning swimmers out to sea.
The Apex keyless watch, made at the
Beaucourt factory in France, has entered the
Australian market in earnest, and is advertised at
.£1 post free to any address in Australasia —vide
inside back cover of this week’s Bulletin. It is a
stem short-winder, has works equal to those of the
best £8 silver or £2O gold watch, is set in an un-
tarnishable case, will stand the roughest usage,
and is altogether the cheapest, most reliable and
best popular watch ever made. The Beaucourt
Watch Co., Box, No. 68fi, General Post-office,
Sydney, will be glad to receive and publish testi-
monials from Australian buyers.
Dear Bulletin, —What I admire most
about the heathen Chinee is his coolness in emer-
gency. My Chinee is a cook on a river-steamer.
It was his first day aboard, and he wanted water.
A bucket was heaved overboard, and, as we were
going eight knots, the Chinkie nearly followed.
“Oap’n,” he said, some time afterwards, “if you
was welly nigh been dlagged off boat by bucket,
what would you do —let bucket go or hang on?”
“Why, let it go, of course, John,” replied the
skipper, “And, Cap’n,” said the heathen, his
face one huge smile, “that jes’ what I did.” —

Few faces and forms (says the Murchison
Times) are more familiar on the Murchison gold-
field than those of herculean “ Russian Jack ”
(Ivan Fredericks), native of Archangel, in far-
away Northern Russia. Jack is generally re-
garded as the strongest man on the Murchison.
Roughly speaking, he is about 43 years of age,
stands 6ft., and has a chest measurement of about
48in. He is strong as a lion, and, like another
big fellow —Prof. Miller, of Melbourne—is light-
hearted, and bubbling over with good nature.
Once on a time Jack started for the Kimberley
goldfields—about 300 miles’ journey—walking him-
self and wheeling on a barrow about 2cwt. of
tucker, tools, and other necessaries for a prospect-
ing tour. He pushed his barrow at the rate of 30
miles per day, and when within 70 or 80 miles of
the rush he was making for, he overtook a poor
chap who was humping his swag, and limping
along footsore and almost ready to drop. Jack
took in the situation at once. “ Shove your swag
on the top of mine,” he cheerfully said, and he
trundled away—the other man toiling on slowly
behind. Next day, the other man said he could
not keep up, and asked to be left behind to get on
as best he could. “No fear,” said Jack, and he
picked up the other man, put him also on top of
the already heavy load, and away he went. He
did his usual 30 miles that day, and the next, and
got there all the same.

FOUNTAINS IN PLAY.
Who doesn’t enjoy looking at a fountain in play?
•Ilia bright water leaps into the air as though ib
were a living, conscious thing. Then at the
summit of its arch it is shattered into spray by
the wind, or wafted to and fro like the skirts of a
dancing girl. And all the while the roar of its
rush and the tinkling melody of its fall fill the air.
Inis is water having a, good time—water in high
spints. What makes it jump, sing, and laugh in
■n^i/ aS non ‘ Wait a bit. If you please, we
will have the explanation later on. Perhaps you
know already ; perhaps not. It isn’t so easy to
know things from the bottom.
Under date of March 16th, 1892, a lady writes
that for twenty years she always felt low-spirited.
Now, what is meant by “ spirits ” in this sense is
a condition of the mind in respect of our being
cheerful, happy, enjoying our surroundings, taking
delight in all sorts of minor matters, and, in a word,
making the most of life ourselves and helping
others to make the most of it. Well then, it is
both a glorious and a profitable thing to be always
in good spirits ; I wish I could be myself.
But I can’t; anyhow, I’m not. Neither is
anybody. Yet why not ? What makes our hearts
sink down like a plummet, and then rise like a
cork ?
Before we answer let us read the rest of the
letter. The writer says: “Eor twenty years I
have suffered from liver complaint and indigestion.
1 was constantly tired, weak, and languid. My
skin was a sallow colour, and I had great pain at
the back and shoulders.
My appetite was poor, I had a bad taste in the
mouth, and much pain and weight at the chest
after eating. I was also frequently sick, throwing
up a sour, frothy fluid. I took different kinds of
medicine, but none of them gave me relief, and I
got weaker and weaker.
“In March, 1884, I became so bad that I called
a doctor, who attended me off and on for twelve
months. He gave me medicines, but I grew no
better, as nothing he prescribed seemed to reach
my complaint. About this time I heard of Mother
Seigel’s Syrup, and commenced taking it. In less
than a month all my pain and distress ceased, and
I have since been in good health. I keep a bottle
of the Syrup in the house as a family medicine,
and by taking an occasional dose have needed no
doctor.
“I may mention that my aunt, who lives at
West Wycombe, Bucks, was afflicted with indiges-
tion and dyspepsia. She states that in her opinion
Mother Seigel’s Syrup has been the means of
saving her life. You are at liberty to use this
statement as you may see fit. Yours truly,
(Signed) Mrs. Harriett Cutler. Burton House’
33 Kenmure Road, Hackney, London.”
. No philosopher has yet been able to say what
is the exact relation of the mind to the body.
This much, however, experience constantly assures
us of; that it is very intimate, and that the
condition of the mental faculties depends upon
that of the body. As birds sing when the sun
shines, and are dumb in the dark, so the spirits
and mental powers rise and express themselves
when we are in health, and are dull and torpid
when the body is under the weight of pain and
disease. And to know that is to know all we
require to act upon.
Everything, money, influence, and every form
of success depends so largely upon health that by
universal consent we don’t expect good service
from those who are ill.
And illness, nine times in ten, means precisely
what Mrs. Cutler suffered for such a long and
weary period—indigestion and dyspepsia—the
ailment cured (when the doctors are done with
their fruitless experiments) by Mother Seigel’s
Curative Syrup.
The fountains play only when the water is
forced powerfully through their pipes by gravity
or by machinery. So the spirits are free and
elastic only when the organs within us act without
hindrance or obstruction.
The Price of Truth.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
At every step in the search after truth a man tramples
on his own heart.—Olive Schreiner.
I have had none to say unto me ; “ Lo.!
This way, or that way, thou shalt turn and go.
“Thou hast the strength of soul that sets men
free,
The ways the thousands go are not for thee.
“ Thou shalt go down through wastelands dim
and vast,
Untrammelled by the thoughts of all the past—•
“ The past that grips the present as it stands,
And drags it downward with its ghastly hands.
“Thou shalt go out where’er thy light may
lead,
And in the lonely night thy heart shall bleed j
“Till, in the world around, the skies above,
Thou shalt not find nor tenderness nor love ;
“Nor evidence of system, nor of plan,
In all the universe, nor care for man.
“And, though thy heart shalt fail, and thou
shalt yearn
To feel thy fellows’ hands, thou canst not turn.
“But thou shalt see betimes, beside thy way,
The bones of those who went, like thee, astray.
“ And though thou criest, ‘ O God ! the whence
or why !’
Thou shalt not hear an echo of thy cry,”
Brisbane.
K.
Lost in the Bush.
‘ Any adult male who is * lost in the bush ’ must
either be of defective intellect or incapable of
applying his intelligence practically,” says Mr.
Sharp, L.S., in S.M. Herald. There is some
truth in this, but it requires sifting. People who
“lose ” themselves generally get flurried, and are,
therefore, for the time being, incapable of practi-
cally applying their intelligence. Then the ques-
tion becomes a matter of physical endurance
whether they can hold out until they find
themselves again. There is scarcely any
rule possible to lay down, men’s tempera-
ments vary so. Most adult males know,
without teaching, that when a man is east
of a river he must go west to look for it again, but
there are cases where one might go astray even
in doing that. Take many portions of the interior
where the rivers are intermittent, i.e., lose their
defined channels for a time. Supposing a man
struck one of these gaps, he might go west until
further orders looking for that river. Again, take
Western Australia in parts where there are
no rivers, creeks, nor leading features, and a good
deal of scrub. On a dull day, without a compass,
the ordinary man minus the special instinct of
locality would stand a very bad show, no matter
what precepts had been instilled into him. Cer-
tainly every man should carry a pocket-compass,
as it would give him confidence that he was going
in a straight line ; and, so far as N.S. Wales and
Victoria are concerned, he could not go long on a
straight line without coming to something. The
prominent stars, as well as the sun and moon, are,
of course, good guides; and most people know the
prominent stars by sight, even if not by name.
Bushmanship, as an instinctive knowledge of
locality is called, is undoubtedly as much a gift as
music or painting. You can no more make
bushmen of some men, although they live in the
bush all their lives, than you can make a musician
of a man who has not the natural aptitude.
Education will do little in the matter, otherwise
it would not be so notorious that surveyors (!)
are usually bad bushmen. Then, again, we
have such instances as Leichhardt and Lands-
borough, who were both deficient in the gift.
One man can recognise such an object as a clump
of timber, a particular rock, &0., even in the dark,
although only once seen, and another might pass
it twenty times and not remember it. To some
the bush is all alike; to others there are not two
yards the same. To keep cool, to keep a straight
line, and carry a pocket-compass is about the only
advice to give to the general public; to go into
details would only “ bother ” men who, after all,
would not understand it any more than the non-
musician understands anything but simple tunes.
DELOOMFN
Australian papers hold up Amir Abd-u-
Raliman as “the ally of Britain.” He is, for a
substantial consideration in the shape of an annual
pension which alone has enabled him to keep his
seat on the CHbuli throne. The idea that Abd-u-
Rahrnan’s incoherent sovereignty is a “buffer”
between Russia and India is one of those political
superstitions ingrained in the Jingo mind. Oabul
could oppose no effective resistance to a Russian
advance, simply because it would fall to pieces at
the first touch. The men of the tribes are brave
enough, but as soon as the pressure from
was removed, they would begin fighting among
themselves. Afghanistan is itself a superstition—
a mere geographical expression for a country
inhabited by a miscellaneous collection of moun-
tain tribes, whose territory has been pierced a
score of times since Alexander’s day by the in-
vaders of India.

In its picturesque and dramatic character, the life
of ex-Ohief Justice Alfred Stephen, of.N.S.W,,
stands pre-eminent in the remarkable record of
the many individualities which have distinguished
the brief page of Australian history. Consider
that tliis man who but a day or two agone was
carried to his grave, knew Wilberforce, and had
heard Canning; had listened in private to the
chastened eloquence which had freed the slave,
and in the halls of the Senate to that embellished
oratory which, transmuted into action, had
“ created a new world to redress the balance of
the old !” Consider this one simple fact, and
grasp, if you can, the tremendousness of the moral
and political revolutions which were embraced
within the span of that one man’s life !
• * •
Fertile in incident such a life must necessarily
have been when that life linked the England of
the first decade of the century and the Australia
of the last. Episodes to furnish motives for fifty
average novels can be chosen from the “ storied
tissue ”of such an experience. Here are two or
three which pulse with the emotion of human
stress and storm, taken from the tale of his early
colonial years.
* # *
The Hobart Town Press in the early twenties
was official, and therefore the reverse of “free.”
It was as literally “under bond” as a newly-
arrived transport with a life-sentence. Then fear-
less expression of opinion adverse to the authorities
was impossible without risk of the forfeiture o(
liberty or goods. Young Crown-Solicitor Stephen
was, no doubt conscientiously, opposed from the
first to freeing the Press from its restrictions. He
smote with legal weapons the few rare spirits who
dared to censure him. Melville, Bent, Savary—
these three felt the force of his law-strengthened
arm. Savary was a convict whose slight chance
of freedom would have been altogether lost had
legal evidence been forthcoming to convict him of
the authorship of a certain published letter.
He was suspected of. the authorship, but proof
could not be obtained which would satisfy the
exactness of Stephen’s judgment. But, failing the
writer, the publisher could be punished. And
punished Melville would have been to the loss of
all property but for a deed creditable to both the
Crown Solicitor and the convict.
• • »
One night, Mr. Stephen was called from his
drawing-room to the verandah of his cottage. “ A
pris’ner wished to see him.” Demurring at first-
most irregular was it for a great official then to be
interviewed by a man under bond—he at last
consented. The “prisoner” was Savary, or
Savery—formerly a rich sugar-boiler, then Mayor
of Bristol, later a condarane to the gallows, later
still, as we see him now, a transport for life.
“Do I speak, sir, to Mr. Stephen the man, or
to Mr. Stephen the Crown Solicitor?” asked
Savary, saluting as by regulation compelled.
“ I cannot separate myself from my office,” said
Mr. Stephen.
“Not even to do a kindly, a generous thing,
your Honor ? ”
“lean make no conditions,” replied the law-
officer.
Savary saluted again, apologised for troubling
His Honor, but said, as he turned to go,
Punish Mr. Melville, sir, for printing that
letter and you ruin an innocent man. I wrote
the letter, and will say so in Court.”
He went, believing that his one chance for a
conditional pardon was thus forfeited.
aic ol )e , nex * ) da y, proceedings were stayed.
Irred otephen was touched by the convict’s mag-
nanimity, and for once, at least, dissociated the
man from the official.
* * *
Bent libelled Stephen—though now it does not
seem a very terrible libel. But the Governor in-
sisted that certain action should be taken. It
was taken, and Bent was ruined. Years after-
wards, Bent wished to make a fresh start in
oydney. ihe first five pounds subscribed to the
tuna in aid of his project was contributed by
Judge Stephen. J
* * •
Atone Assize in Launceston, Attorney-General
Stephen prosecuted to conviction 78 capital
offenders, of whom 30 were hanged.
* * *
Distinguished lawyer as Alfred Stephen proved
to be, it is curious to learn that in his early
professional years he hated the law. A diary lies
before me as I write, which is the record of a
woman’s life in Australia and Tasmania from 1830
to 1865. Ihe lady was the wife of an officer who
arrived with his regiment at Hobart Town in the
early “ thirties.” “The night of my arrival,” she
writes, “I danced with the Attorney-General of
the colony at a ball given by the Governor. He
was a charming companion, and a good dancer,
but amused me greatly by regretting that he had
been trained to the law. It was his ambition to
become an upholsterer ! ”
* • •
Alfred Stephen’s first case in the colonies was
one in which he figured as plaintiff. He sued the
captain of the vessel which brought him and his
wife to Van Diemen’s Land for non-fulfilment of
contract to provide suitable aboardship accommod-
ation. He won the case. The man was his own
lawyer here, but he had no fool for his client.
* * *
Among the assigned servants in Hobart Town
was a man who had been one of Stephen’s school-
mates, The fellow was an unsurpassably in-
genious scoundrel, and frequently obtained goods
from tradesmen on his master’s account. It fell to
Stephen’s lot to prosecute him. The jury was
a military one of five officers. “Gentlemen,”
said the prisoner, “ don’t let the Crown Solicitor
have it upon his conscience that he hanged a man
who had been his companion in boyhood’s innocent
hours. Don’t spare me, gentlemen, but consider
Mr. Stephen!” The jury laughed, the Court
smiled, Mr. Stephen remained for a moment
silent, and then said simply: “Gentlemen, your
oath !” And the man was found guilty.
* * »
At a time when everyone almost in official
circles frowned upon Captain Maconochie’s
attempts to reform the most heinous criminals by
lenient methods, Alfred Stephen was the one
prominent public official who, without absolutely
accepting all that Maconoehie planned, aided him
by encouraging words. “Do your best,” he
wrote, “even though you fail.”
* • #
Thomas Griffiths Wainwright, the notorious
poisoner, the friend of Charles Lamb and Hazlitt,
the terrible original of Varney in Bulwer
Lytton’s “ Lucretia,” and the villain in Dickens’
“Hunted Down,” painted a portrait for Mr.
Stephen. At the time Wainwright was a wards-
man in the general hospital at Hobart, and
reports were current as to the brutality of his
treatment of the patients in his charge. Mr.
Stephen cautioned him to be careful of his con-
duct. “Sir,” replied Wainwright, “men of cul-
ture and refinement such as you and I should
forget that we stand to each other in any other
relation than that of artist and patron !”
# * •
A man was indicted ■ by Attorney-Gen oral
Stephen for forging a promissory-note of one J.
Weavell for the sum of one shilling. “It is not
the value of the sum thus fraudulently obtained,”
declared the law-officer to the jury, “ that has to
be regarded, but the crime of forgery.” The man
was hanged. Here we have the stern sense of
duty in the prosecuting barrister, which, in the
J udge, became an apparently merciless severity.
* * #
In the first two-volume novel ever printed in
Australia, and possibly the first ever written,
Alfred Stephen was introduced as one of the
characters. The author was Savary abovemen-
tioned, and the book was “Quintus Servinton.”
Savary died a suicide.
« » 9
W. H. Barber, the heroic solicitor, who was
transported in 1844 for forgery, and subsequently
proved innocent, found a friend in Stephen—then
Judge in New South Wales. Stephen initiated
the subscriptipn which sent Barber to Paris (as he
was not permitted to set foot in the United
Kingdom for some time) so that he might con-
vince the British authorities of his innocence.
After a struggle of 20 years’ duration, Barber
succeeded, only to die. One of his last letters
was to Alfred Stephen. At the great Assize
that letter may be safely trusted to balance the
errors of even so long a life.
One of the less admirable episodes in the dead
jurist’s career was his treatment of Gellibrand,
Attorney-General at the time Mr. Stephen arrived
in V.D. Land. Mr. Stephen was, as a law-
officer, liable to have his course of action over-
ridden by Mr. Gellibrand. Gellibrand was a man
of high character, but imperious in temper.
Stephen had all the aggressiveness of a young
man, which was rather heightened than modified
by the belief that as he came of a legal family he
was the possessor of inherited legal acumen. No
wonder, therefore, they quarrelled. The fault
was unquestionably with the younger man, and
he carried the vendetta to a point which, in after
years, he must have looked upon regretfully.
Gellibrand’s infirmity of temper accentuated the
trouble; and Arthur, Lieutenant-Governor, a
vindictive-spirited administrator, had had his own
quarrel with Gellibrand and supported Stephen.
# * «
The contest thus ended with Gellibrand’s dis-
comfiture. He left office a disappointed man.
But —and here is why the incident is now referred
to—as so often happens, out of private wrong
cometh public good, Gellibrand, finding Van
Diemen’s Land too small a sphere for his enter-
prising spirit and untiring industry, conceived a
plan for the exploration and pastoral settlement of
Port Phillip (Victoria). He it was who organised
the association which sent out John Batman, the
founder of Victoria, He it was who drew up the
memorandum of agreement among the subscribers.
He it was who supplied the organising, con-
trolling energy of the movement, and who carried
his devotion to the future of the enterprise to the
extent that he laid down his life for it. Per-
aonally visiting the settlement to explore “the
new country,” he, with a companion, Hesse, set
out one morning to traverse “ the fresh woods and
pastures new ” of the district extending from
Geelong to Birregurra. They were never seen by
white men again. The blacks killed them—and,
it is a traditional belief in Western Victoria—ate
them.
* * •
Thus Mr. Stephen’s action was directly the
cause of Victoria’s foundation —at all events, but
for him the settlement of the colony would not
have taken place till a later date.
* * •
In 1892, the British Museum purchased for =£2s,
in London, one of the duplicates of an agreement
drawn up between John Batman and Jagga-
Jagga, the chief of the Dutigalla tribe of abori-
gines, whose camping-ground was the present site
of Melbourne. The other copy is now jealously
preserved in the Melbourne Public Library. Ge(-
librand drafted and engrossed the documents, but
he was never aware that one of his co-members of
the Association had submitted the draft con-
fidentially to Alfred Stephen, or that one of the
suggestions he, Gellibrand, accepted and embodied
with the final copy, was made by the man he
regarded as his bitter enemy.
* # #
As to Judge Stephen’s opposition to the reprieve
of Mary Brownlow, had the Stephen Divorce Act
of to-day been then in operation, the chances are
that that poor woman would, long before the occur-
rence of the event which prompted the desperate
deed for which she was hanged, have secured a
divorce from her brutal husband. In a casual
discussion of the Brownlow case, after the passage
of the Divorce Act, the ex-Judge had this put
before him. It was, perhaps, unnecessary to do
so. For it is pretty certain that in the Brownlow
case was the germ of the great enactment of his
last legislative years.
* * *
It was in connection with the Brownlow case
that a dramatic incident occurred. Special
arrangements had been made by the coach-pro-
prietors to carry what was believed to be the
reprieve from Sydney to Goulburn. Everyone
put forth strenuous efforts to reach the scene of
the execution before the dread climax. Surely
there could be no doubt the document so urgently
transmitted was the commutation order! But—
it was the death warrant! The driver of the
coach (a hotel-keeper at Gundagai) afterwards told
the writer that had he known the true nature of
the paper he would have lost the mail.
• * #
Alfred Stephen was a contributor to the Tas-
manian Gazette when Dr. Ross edited it. He
also wrote_ colonial letters to the Morning
Chronicle in London, and in later years his con-
tributions were published in the Australian,
Atlas, and Herald (Sydney). He wrote a
remarkably clear hand—and thus was a delight to
compositors. In Sydney, in 1848, a compositor
in the Atlas office, then edited by James
Martin, afterwards Stephen’s successor in the
Chief Justiceship, received a slip of “copy” to
set up; The “ copy ” was that of a satirical poem
to which no signature was attached, “ Whoever
wrote that,’’ exclaimed the printer, “used to
write from Van Diemen’s Land to the Chronicle
when I was in that office. There was one letter
I remember which, when it reached Australia,
must have made trouble for somebody.” The
verses were written by Stephen.— “ One Who
Knew Him,” in Windsor (N.S.W.) Gazette

(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
It was not in wooded valley, by the springing year
made gay,
With the zephyr softly sighing through the golden
wattle-spray ;
Nob in gorgeous planted garden ’mid exotic
beauties rare,
Nor by peaceful river scented with the fragrant
forest air.
There was nob a thing romantic in that sombre,
sober spot,
Save the sad sprig, full of meaning, of the blue
forget-me-not.
It was off a city roadway, in a cheerless, dismal
room,
That a lovely form lay dying in the hideous lethal
gloom;
I had loved but had nob won her, though she
loved me passing well,
And though since she bade me leave her, all her
life was earthly hell.
If our loving had but linked us fair our lives had
been and bright,
But her thoughts were queenly ever, and I knew
my love was right.
I remembered how, a few years back, I’d clasped
in fond embrace
That divinely-minded woman, finest type of all
How her eager lips with mine had met in passion’s
wildest kiss
When I dreamt our souls were gliding into life-
long lovers’ bliss.
How ray every fibre tingled as we clung there
breast to breast,
As I felt the passioned grasping of the fingers that
I pressed.
’Twas in hot beseeching accents that I asked her
if with me
She would leave that house of torture for a home
beyond the sea.
Would she cast away the sorrow of her fearful
married life;
Would she kneel at God’s high altar and become
my lawful wife.
For my love had wed a tyrant who bub made her
fret and fear,
Who was common-place 'and brutal —most repul-
sive mate for her.
Then she raised her warm web eyelids, and I
paused to hear her choice;
There was music low and mournful in her sweet
and trembling voice:
“ Though I loathe my hated husband with his
heartless cutting sneer,
I have borne unto him children, and I hold those
children dear;
And the blood I gave my offspring ne er shall rise
in blush of shame .
When the hard world in derision speaks their
loving mother’s name.’
Then I told her that those children would be mine
across the sea,
But her woman’s instinct shuddered at the hinted
infamy.
“No, dear, no; before the great world purest
wifely love I’ll feign,
That the name I leave my darlings may be left
them free from stain.”
All those years in lonely longing she had lived the
bounden lie;
Since that night we had not spoken till I came to
see her die.
Then the smile with which she met ,me showed a
mind at last at rest;
There was naught of fevered passion in the fingers
that I pressed.
She had fought the fight and conquered, but at
what a frightful cost 1
For we counted no hereafter and her earthly joy
was lost.
Have our pious modern Christians such unselfish
Christ-like care ?
God Almighty ! what a torment may thy noblest
creatures bear.

Bush Orgies and Fighting.
Dear Bulletin,— Re your quotation from that
distinguished Australian explorer, Guy Boothby,
of a bush ball at Cloncurry, I wish to take exoep-
tion to the idea engendered. I am sorry to say
that, to many “Australian” authors, the revelry
of a bush pub. is a scene of wild and dangerous
single combats. Men fight in Australia just as
much, and no more, than they do in other coun-
tries. The ordinary drunken bush-hand usually
starts by calling his opponent a something “liar !”
The other retorts by calling him an embellished
liar!!” and so it goes on until one or the other’s
vocabulary of adjectives is exhausted. Perhaps
one may emphasise his defiance by smashing his
thick-bottomed tumbler on the counter, and being
promptly charged two-and-six by the landlord for
breakage; but there will be no fight. Of course,
there are scrapping matches, and one or two may
come down, making clumsy rushes; but no real
fighting. I and two others once camped at a
bush pub., after being up nearly two nights
watching rowdy cattle. It was raining cats
and dogs, the cattle had been delivered and
yarded, so we thought we were due for a good
night’s sleep under shelter. It was in the neigh-
borhood of one of the earliest of the N.Q. gold-
fieids, and there were about twenty or more men
drinking in the house, a common bush shanty
w herein every whisper was audible. They kept it
up until morning, and, to an innocent new-chum
Q- U y Boothby, no doubt it would seem that a
pandemonium of carnage was raging, but there
wag no fighting, and no one seemed to expect a
fight. Every time I awoke—for I slept through
KtK
»•»* “ “f rav < 4 r “ h ’’ in the morning-
through having fallen on the floor on their faces,
but that was the worst. As I said before, men
fight no more and no less here than m other
countries. In the course of a far-back bush ex-
penence of many years, in four of the five pro-
-o„|y morning; fought scientifically to a finish,
and—in one case—an almost fatal finish. No !
the bush hand when drunk may rend the air with
lurid blasphemy, but there is really little of this
“going into the backyard business,” so popular
with modern bush authors. There is any amount
of tall blowing a few days afterwards, and the man
with the biggest voice, who has called the others the
biggest number of “favorite liars,” has many stories
of his gory prowess to relate—and there it stops.
As for bush balls 1 I never saw one on the Clon-
curry, nor—in point of fact —do I think there
have been many balls held there, for obvious
reasons ; but I have seen bush balls in many other
Queensland townships in the rough-and-ready
days, and 1 must confess that I do not recognise
Mr. Boothby’s description. It certainly is like
many I have seen written up by men calling them-
selves Australians, but nothing more than a dim
resemblance to it has ever come under my notice.
Every girl, high and low, has a love of “side”
inherent in her, and the lower her station the
more she would be likely to insist upon attention
to little social details. Of course I do not refer
to an abandoned woman. As to what I said about
the non-fighting of the bush-hand when drunk, be
it understood that I have no experience of a navvy’s
camp, where, I believe, a good deal of brutal
fighting goes on.
BINGHI.
Judge Casey, of Yic. County Court, culti-
vates the courteous and urbane, and pulled up
counsel, who was conducting a cross-examination,
for conduct he termed “ ungentlemanly.” Counsel
retorted that he was unaware his conduct was so.
His Honor: “Your inability in that direction is a
matter of regret to the court and sorrow to your
friends. Let the case proceed.’*
George Bates, lately admitted to S.A.
Destitute Asylum, settled on Kangaroo Island
(S.A.) in 1824, 13 years before S.A. was founded.
He originally came to Australia as seaman on a
convict ship in 1822. Bates lived with the natives
on the S.A, mainland for years, and the first
settlers who arrived from England were much
astonished when they were welcomed by a white
man with a numerous brood of half-castes. Asked
recently by a pressman what was his most excit-
ing adventure, old George replied, “ Well—l think
the nearest shave I ever had was when I got
drunk at Port Adelaide and walked straight out of
Joe Barney’s pub. into the river 1”
S.M. Herald prints some very good lead-
ing articles now, and is broadening surprisingly.
Apropos a shrieky evangelist’s suggestion that, in
the plain and holy language of Scripture, no man
can see a woman in evening dress without lusting
after her, the Herald goes so far as to say :
The teaching of history and experience is that the
asoetio ideal, by its impracticability and its ignoring a
large and indestructible part of our nature and our life,
has at times done much more to depreciate the average
standard of morality than to raise it.
This is a definite acceptance of the creed that
“self-development is higher than self-sacrifice,”
that man doesn’t want salvation, only educa-
tion ; and it thus amounts to a definite rejec-
tion of the cardinal dogma of all the Oriental
faiths, which preach that natural passions are
wrong and should be repressed and extirpated.
It is quite possible that in another 100 years or so
the Herald will denounce monarchy, priestcraft
and other shibboleths with all its might.
“ Warrigal ” writes to The Bulletin on a
chapter of N.S.W. bushranging history :
A correspondent of yours institutes a comparison
between cavalry-sword and revolver as effective weapons
for troopers, and satisfactorily proves, to himself, that
for offensive purposes the former instrument is the better
in such guerrilla warfare as that in which poor Sergeant
Wallings was engaged when he lost his life. Youroorres-
pendent’s facts, as he relates them, would, to some extent
substantiate his inference, but as his case is in the main
purely hypothetical, his conclusions, for all comparative
purpose, are valueless. I tell the story thus:—lt was in
78, after the big drought broke up, and “ information ’’
by the usual mysterious channel was conveyed to the
police that “Midnight,” as we knew him, would be at
“Mother Mill’s ” place on a certain date. Mother Mill’s
it should be interjected, was a pub. of the good old
variety that had its own little coterie of supporters who
appeared and disappeared in eccentric fashion, but always
turning up, mostly “ from Queensland,” at unsuspected
periods, and within a week or two of each other, to drink
gamble, and compare notes. “Midnight" was one of
these, and one of the most daring and unscrupulous of
them all. In the bush he was not less fearless, and night
or day, whatever the job, he could be depended upon to
do his share of it. The intelligence concerning his move-
ments was correct, and, as he was “wanted," Sergt. Wal-
lings himself undertook the service of capture, having
with him Sergt. Souter, of Warren, and P. 0. Walsh, of
Dubbo. I should explain that “ Mother Mill’s Place " was
on Wonbobbie, 16 miles from Warren. Wonbobbie is now in
the possession of Mr. Thos. Buckland, but was then owned
by Mr. H. Bird, son of Major Bird, and the handsomest
man in the North-West. On the night preceding the
tragedy, the police took up position and surrounded the
house. At daylight a demand for admission was made in
the usual terms. Immediately this alarm was given
“Midnight” was seen scurrying from the backhand
making toward a fence, 60 or 70 yards away. Wallings
rightly guessed this to be his man, took after him, arid
firing over his head—not at him, remember- called for a
surrender. Seeing the fence was unattainable, “Mid-
night " dropped behind a tree and, shouldering a Snider
levelled it straight at the sergeant, remarking, in low’
but distinct tones, “ Keep back, Wallings, or by God I’ll
put a bullet through you, for I’ll never be taken alive!”
The unfortunate officer, making some sort of laughing
reply about the “game being up” and the “ nonsense” of
resisting, blazed away mercifully high again, and continued
to advance. He was not 30ft. away when the rifle banged
and Wallings threw up his arms with a cry and fell from
his horse in a heap to the ground, mortally wounded in
the chest. Midnight then got through the fence un-
molested, and a few days later a blood stallion disappeared
from Warrana, Buchanan’s station, 60 miles away. The
police, of course, were up and out in all directions, but
Midnight’s track was never hit upon till “information”
was again sent in—by a woman, they say—that he would
endeavor to cross the Q. border on a certain day, vid
Eungonia. This was also “ straight wire,” and Constable
Grey, of Bourke, I think, with a blackfellow, getting on
the right track from a well-known wayback shanty, stuck
to it and came up with his quarry on the Warrego.
Grey played at long range for some time, when he first
brought down the horse and, finally, the man, planting,
it is said, nearly as much lead in both as Thunderbolt
carried to the tomb with him. As for the “ auxiliaries"
Wallings took with him, Souter, when he saw the nature
of the wound, immediately gallopped to Wonbobbie,
“for assistance” (his own words); while Walsh alleged that
he tried to make his horse jump the fence to go in pursuit
when y Midnight ” discharged another shot that took his
steed in the ear, which rendered the animal unmanage-
able for several miles up the road. For the rest, had
Wallings fired right at “ Midnight,” he would, in all pro-
bability, have hit and disabled the fellow, as he was more
than fairly good with pistol or revolver. As for the sword,
a broom-handle would have been just as useful. To the
last moment of his life, Wallings thought “ Midnight"
would not dare to fire at him.

Tales of the Austral Tropics.
“ The volume takes its name from one of the sketches, ‘ The Last of Six,’ though in point of merit they all stand pretty well on a par. The
author, who is familiar with life in Northern Queensland, writes with vigour about the doings of the whites and the natives in those faraway
parts. A strong vein ot mysticism runs through his narratives, and there are ghosts in almost every chapter, and for those who are fond of
realistic work the volume will prove attractive reading.”—S.M. Herald, July 8, 1893.
“ No writer has given the world a more vivid description of Australia and its wilderness than Ernest Favenc, and the secret of this is that
he has, by many years’ experience of travel and bush life, acquired a knowledge of this continent which is possessed by scarcely any other writer.
He, too, possesses great descriptive powers. Whatever he puts pen to is certain to be good. In the stories under notice he has given us some of
his best work. That they will be widely read is certain.”— Sydney Mail, July 8, 1893.
“They present with force and vividness, as well as with the accuracy arising from long contact and keen observation, striking pictures of
parts of Australia unfamiliar to most of its inhabitants ; they tell, sometimes with remarkable power, of incidents such as happen in wild places
when human hearts are stirred by strong passions, and of weird imaginings that move the minds of lonely men. ‘ The Last of Six ’ is a terrible
talc of cannibalism, treachery, and revenge upon the dead, which in other hands might be gross and hideous, but which Mr. h avenc makes of
thrilling interest. ‘ The Haunt of the Jinkarras’ suggests Rider Haggard and his imitators to some extent, but is itself relieved from the
suspicion of imitation by faithful local colour and a grotesquerie of conception, in which Mr. Favenc here and there approaches Poo. This
characteristic is especially noticeable in ‘Spirit Led,’ which the great American might have written. ‘A Cup of Cold Water’ is, perhaps, the
best tale in a collection that should be widely read, and which forms a worthy addition to purely Australian literature.”— Daily Telegraph
July 15, 1893.
“ ‘ The Last of Six ;’ and other stories. By Ernest Favenc. (Sydney : The Bulletin Newspaper Co ) This is a collection of short but
graphic sketches by Mr. Favenc, the well-known explorer, who has a rare collection of Australian legendary lore. All the stories here are good,
and « o can heartily endorse the recommendatory notice by Rolf Boldrewood prefixed to this collection. The present issue forms the third of The
Bulletin scries of Australian reminiscences.”— Australian Star, July 15, 1893.
