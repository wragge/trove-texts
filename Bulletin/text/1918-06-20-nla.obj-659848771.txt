The Red Page
Bruges, in Flanders
Old Memlinc —Hans, not Jan —paintec
some miniature pictures 500 years ago
which hang in a room behind St. John’
Hospital in Bruges. I say “hang”; bu
Bruges is now the German depot and base
for transferring prisoners and wounded, so
I don’t suppose much is left. It is probably
safe to say that those five Memlincs have
gone; they are easily worth half a millioi
dollars in New York. Good pictures : film
and deft and strong. Flemish kitchens
with very high lights and very low lights
babies in cradles before huge open fires
busy housewives, and quiet, dull men sit
ting at their tables in the eventide.
The run from Ostend to Bruges takes 15
minutes, in silly little coupes holding six
yet very comfortable. We pottered liwaj
from the garish twentieth-century resort,
-gambling clubs, pubs, notorious gorgeous
hotels; all built yesterday and full to-day
and to-night and to-morrow, and anon empty.
I saw old King Leopold on the Digue There
more than once, with a characteristic body-
guard of a lady-in-waiting on either .side,
the gentlemen in attendance some distance
in the rear. A bad old man, but clever and
strong: a good builder of cities and a good
director of a nation.
The train fumbles slowly into Bruges,
mediaeval, reticent and muffled, ancient and
quiet; dignified, secretive, mellow. The
cab rolls over tortuous, cobbled streets and
lanes and alleyways. The very echoes it
wakes are dim ami shady and old, rising to
join the whispered colloquies of the gabled,
red-roofed, Gothic houses —tliousand-years-
whispered colloquies. The place has fallen
in years, is imprisoned in old age.
As I look back at the city from the height
of our. bright youth and ■ strength, a deep
pity mingles with my affection. Not pity
for the fighting days she endures now. Such
days have been her portion all her life. The
tramp of hostile feet on her cobblestones
must beat film her own men’s feet, so usual
is the sound in her ears. But pity rather
for the stagnant age. Time was when she
-was rich and powerful. But silt packed
itself athwart the river’s mouth and the tall
ships and the business went to Antwerp.
And Brugge slipt into a backwater, and
became a haunt of antiquarians and artists
and writers and other half-witted folk.
In the rich years, seditions, Low Country
wars, Norman invasions, innumerable ex-
ternal and internal troubles—these and the
like kept her busy. This showman’s job
that lasted 500 years must have bored her
stiff: she must have looked back often and
wistfully to the days of blood and murder
ami sudden death. And now— Germans, of
all people!
Velasquez had a Crucifixion in the Cathe-
dral which would break your heart—the
soul of pain itself. And old Memlinc had
those fiery visions in the hospital. Even
Michael Angelo had a marble Madonna,
floating mistily in a dim aisle of Notre
Dame, an icy -guardian angel of the ungodly
and the godly. The Gruuthuuse kitchen was
furnished _ with mediaeval chairs and tables
and utensils, all authentic and some of silver
and gold. In dim Gothic rooms overhanging
the canals were gleaming Missals, decorated
and illuminated in incredible colors, the
long labor of the friars. There was lace,
miles of gossamer and cobwebs ; an effigy of
pink alabaster on a black tomb ; a Moorish
Catholic Church My memory fails me.
A Ministry of Arts kept a watchful eye.
Bruges lived by its peering tourists and visi-
tors ; would a man build a shed within the
city limits, the Ministry of Arts leaned over
his shoulder, lest the shed be not a truly
Gothic shed.
The old man with the patriarchal beard
and the shocking reputation seldom troubled
Bruges. He went through from Ostend to
his beloved Brussels, which he had disposed
in imitation of Paris. The place suited him
very well. His forcing of the vivacious
Parisian spirit on the Dutch-extracted stolid-
ity was a difficult job and noble. That
Flemish phlegm would have been retrograde
—or at best stationary—alone. I think his-
tory will forgive him the Congo, if we can’t.
HILARY LOFTING.
In the Name of the Prophet
A little book, without which no home is
complete, is Prophecy Concerning the Rosh
Keldldh , a product of local industry, now in
its third edition and with abundant hopes
of reaching its thirtieth. It is a work of
mysticism and conglomeration, which throws
new twilight on the Scripture. Inside its
62 pages are many things that are wonder-
ful, many that are beautiful but unconvinc-
ing, many that don’t seem worth while, and
a lot that fathom the depths of the soul but
are not quoted on the Stock Exchange. The
author has a streak of poetry in him. He has
devoted much study to matters of ancient learn-
ing -which would have a better show if the
ancient learning wasn’t so much eclipsed by
the high price of modern provisions; and the
work suggests that he suffers from compres-
sion, possibly caused by the increased cost
of paper. His book is a pearl of a sort cast
before swine, just when the ruling rates in
the pork market have caused swine to be
scarce and supercilious.
In the compass of 62 pages the volume
explains the disappearance of the tribe of
Dan from Holy Writ. Its case was so bad
that it wasn’t even cursed, but was obliter-
ated with silent contempt. Prophets, priests
and monarchs are glanced at, with their
causes, reasons, vocabularies, aims, clothes
and results. Brief explanations are fur-
nished of the “beasts” in Revelation, also the
“seals,” the “cherubim,” the “waters,” and
the etceteras; and the whole system of gov-
ernment is thrown in like 2h per cent, dis-
count qr as one might throw r a brown paper
parcel through the carriage window when

CaOS SARD
Corsets.
The Original Front-Lacing Corsets
Made in the United States and Canada. Worn
with health and comfort by women the world over
OFFERED this season with a front so perfect
that it rivals the beauty of the world-famed
Gossard back.
This cleverly designed front absolutely eliminates
all appearance of fat or thickness at the front and
emphasizes the delicate curve of the waistline by
accenting the curve under the bust. Only in a
Gossard can this perfect front be attained, together
with the small hips and flat back demanded by the
present mode. Gossards are the only front-lacing
corsets that completely conform to Fashion’s lines.
Be sure you buy a genuine Gossard. The name
Gossard on the inside of the corset is your guar-
antee of the original. Look for the name
Qossard
and demand the genuine.
All front-lacing corsets are not Gossards. A
Gossard is a front-lacing corset made by Gossard.
A genuine Gossard means more than a front-
lacing corset; it means emphatically a perfect front,
a smooth back, your all-day comfort, your safe-
guarded health —it means unusual wearing service
alone worth the price you may pay.
Priced at 12/6 and up
Let your refusal of a front-lacing corset bearing
other than the Gossard name be just as pronounced
as would be your refusal of counterfeit money.
It is true economy to have at least two Gossard
Corsets in your wardrobe—-you will be more com-
fortably dressed andthey will give you longer service.
That the front lacing is the superior method of
lacing is conceded by the best dressed women the
world over. Gossard Corsets are the original front-
lacing corsets and the perfect expression of the
front-lacing principles. In your search for the per-
fect corset you will finally wear a Gossard, so an-
ticipate the inevitable—buy and enjoy one now.
Some stores do not sell the genuine Gossard Cor-
sets; some palm off imitations. There is a store—
sometimes more—in every city selling the genuine
Gossard Corsets. You will know them by their
Gossard signs displayed in their window and by
their advertising Gossard Corsets.

If you really want

Your Obedient Servants
That’s the relation of
Big Ben and Baby Ben
to thousands of men and
women who believe in
the economy of living
on time.
They were born to serve —to
take orders and obey— to run
and ring on time. And they do
their tasks cheerfully—do them
well.
Big Ben and Baby Ben head a family
of successful clocks—the Westclox
family from over the sea. The Westclox
mark of merit on the dial denotes a
better construction inside. Needle-fine
pivots of polished steel greatly reduce
friction in this patented method of clock
making. Westclox success is bred
in the bone.
These are clocks you’ll respect; for
they record time carefully like the
precious thing it is.
Big Ben is seven inches tall; Baby
Ben is 3£ inches. And either, or both,
will find a favored spot in your home.
Your clock dealer has them; price
each, 15/-.

And if by daily habit and by simple

his nerve will not fail him in any crisis.
Such men succeed where others dare

Red gold is the setting- sun,
Red gold is the rising moon,
And in their glow and gleam
We two must end our dream
Too soon, and all too soon!
Red gold is the setting sun,
Red gold is the rising moon!
If I go east to the moon,
And you go west to the sun,
We sure shall meet anon,
When many nights have gone
And many days are done;
If I go east to the moon,
And you go west to the sun.
The West shall call the Bast,
And the East shall call the West:
And worlds are- not too wide
When Love, with giant-stride,
Puts forth upon his quest;
The West shall call the East,
And the East shall call the West!
But why go east to the moon,
And why go west to the sun,
Since here and now we meet,
Since love and life are sweet,
Since heart and heart are one?
Then why go east to the moon.
And why go west to the sun?
Our parting bliss forbids;
It mav not be, Dear Heart!
Por what is all the world
And all its flowers, dew-pearled,
When lovers sigh and part?
Our parting Love forbids,
It cannot be, Dear Heart!

Oh, the joy of the clattering hoofs
And the wind rushing by;
The dark ribboned road beneath,
O’erhead a grey sky,
And the green to right and the green to left
And the sheen -where the rivulets lie!
o’er a thundering bridge,
And a river dawn-kissed,
A song to the heart’s quickened beat
Comes out of the mist,
And the chinking soft and the chinking high
Of the bit to the turning wrist.
Oh. the joy of the deep thudding hoofs
O’er a dew-starred plain,
And the leap o’er a clinking creek
To the Load again,
And the plunge to right and the plunge to left
To the curb of the tightening rein!
Speed borne on the breath of the wind
That is scenting the morn,
Unfurling a flag of gold
As the sun is born,
So, light to the East and dusk to the West,
The day comes astride of the dawn.

Under the kindly hypodermic’s reign
The corridors swung on a sea of sleep,
While from the corners hot-eyed ghosts of
pain
Strove at the leash, or broke away to creep
Gibbering towards a door. All starry-eyed
The morning peeped in at the casement wide.
Down a small flight of steps, across a walk
Where breezes stirred, sweet as the breath
of grace,
And a red rose a-tiptoe on its stalk
Thrust through a window a still dewy face—
Then on a wave of air fraught with the
scent
Of ether through the high arched door I
went.
Down long dim terraces of sleep I slipped,
Sighing with peace to rest my fill at last:
Honey of ease cloyed all the air and dripped
Balm upon limbs that knew their tiredness
past,
While from the shadows Death drew greyly
by
For the last whisper of the last faint sigh.
Then through the room came the quick
tramp of feet,
And straightway to the table closely pressed
A form insistent, eager, bent to greet,
A rose gleamed red against his tunic breast.
“I die that she may live,” to Death he said.
And the rose gaped apart and thickly bled.
Sweetly, insistently, upon the high grey
pane,
A red rose tiptoe heat a petalled rain.
The doctor lifted up his tired head,
“Death beaten by a bare half-length.” he
said.

NORA McAULIFFE.
Our Home.
I dreaded lest no house a home could seem
Where you had never been and ne’er could
be ;
So when I left our home all silently
(Because I dared not speak) there seemed
no gleam
Of hope for me; the past was like a dream
Merging into the land of shadows; we
Must henceforth live apart eternally,
I working here, you somewhere in God’s
scheme.
But now I find my home is yours; your
chair,
The books you loved, your pipe, the shelves
you made
All seem a part of you, and bring you there,
So that my mem’ry of you cannot fade.
Your very voice seems ringing in the air;
I almost see you in the twilight shade.

IS AUSTRALIA ON ANOTHER
PLANET?
Sydney Worker, assuring Australia that it
has nothing to be afraid of, commits itself to
these theories and doctrines: —
(1) Australia is practically invulnerable.
(2) No “elaborate system” of defence is necessary.
(8) Wars are nowadays waged only for the pos-
session or exploitation of fertile and undeveloped
territories inhabited by inferior races.
(4) There is nothing to fear from the wanton
aggression of other countries.
(5) A citizen army is not required, it having
been estimated by Kitchener that 80,000 men would
be ample to defend the Commonwealth from invasion.
(6) There is no instance on record of a country
like Australia, isolated from its nearest neighbors by
wide expanses of water, held by a civilised and high-
spirited people, being forcibly seized by • another
people. It simply cannot be done. It is both physi-
cally and morally impossible.
No attempt is made by the Worker to show
why this collection of pragmatic assertions
should be swallowed at one gulp. The state-
ments are just thrown down with a splendid
gesture of finality and an intimation that
unless the Australian toiler refuses to con-
sume them he will be made the victim of
Capitalism and Militarism. The gist of it all
is that nobody can lay violent hands on Aus-
tralia because of some inherent local invul-
nerability. What this invulnerability con-
sists of is left to the imagination. The
Worker may know what it is. The Bul-
letin does not. and pending information on
the point believes it to be a mere rumor.
Assuming that a fleet of warships arrived off
the Australian coast, and there were no war-
ships to meet them, and, further, that they
were accompanied by transports carrying a
quarter of a million men, will the Worker
explain what invulnerable circumstance
would defeat the rest of the strangers’ pro-
gramme? It is no answer to say that the
warships and transports Cannot arrive.
Australia has transported 350,000 men over-
sea- Maorilanders and Afrikanders and
Canadians have been carried in large num-
bers. Uncle: Sam is ferrying his sons
across the Atlantic at the rate of about
50.000 a week. If men and warships
and transports can, under the protec-
tion of naval guns strong enough to
keep the track open, go one way over the
ocean they can go another. If instead of the
British navy being top-dog another navy
could keep the track clear, then men, muni-
tions and transports could arrive in Aus-
tralia as easily as they can now reach
France —and perhaps a great deal more
easily. There is no escape from this. Nor
is there any from the plain fact that Kitch-
ener’s 80,000 men for the defence of Aus-
tralia from invasion would, if the invader
held the sea, be a subject of jest in the comic
papers. Kitchener w-as not thinking of the
conditions Australia would have to face if
the invader had command of the sea. But
the Worker is. Therefore The Bulletin
urges it, in order to clear up the mist about
this invulnerability, to define in plain terms
what it considers Germany would see invul-
nerable about Australia if the trip to Aus-
tralia was as safe as the trip at present is
from Australia, and if the defences of the
Commonwealth were not “elaborate” or had
been wholly neglected.
Anyone who says that wars are only now
waged for possession of undeveloped terri-
tories inhabited by “inferior races” ought at
least to back up the remark with a certain
amount of evidence. The facts of the moment
seem to furnish such an overwhelming con-
tradiction that the observation looks very
like perjury. Servia was not an undeveloped
country nor were the people “inferior.” Yet
Servia has been blotted out of existence. To
speak of Poland, Lithuania and the Ukraine
as the abodes of savages would be ludicrous.
Alsace and Lorraine were not torn in ’7.1
from a France populated by cannibals. The
vast, mineral deposits of Longwy, for which
Germany is fighting- in this war as much as
for anything else, are not owned by nomads.
A Germany that was consolidated with blood
and iron is struggling for more consolidation
with the same materials, trampling over
civilised people and developed countries. It
would be a gross perversion of historical
truth to allege that wars have generally been
by “superior” people upon “inferior” races.
These have been only side-shows. The most
devastating wars the world has known have
been those carried on by peoples who each
believed they were more civilised than the
other, and the tragedy of the world is that
this still holds true. Why Australia should
have nothing to fear from wanton aggression,
when nearly all of Europe is cowering in
fear before an aggressor and the rest is
bleeding in its defence, might be understood
if the invulnerability of the Commonwealth
was madd clear. But an argument for
pacifism based on the theory that the day of
wanton _ aggression is past only sounds like
a poor joke. Those days never have passed.
The record of humanity is red with the proof.
And they never can pass while armies and
navies are maintained to stoush some
wretched victim unable to hit back effec-
tively. There is everything to fear from
wanton aggression and always has been. Can
they who promulgate with one breath the
doctrine that Australia has nothing to fear
because it is “invulnerable,” and with the
next qualify this by a proclamation that
there is no need to fear attack because wan-
ton aggression is not a possible contingency,
point to any imnortant example of a country
which, being unable to defend itself or get
protection from others, was not promptly
pounceu upon by some brutal outsider?
* * * *
It is true that no country “like Australia,”
surrounded by water, has in modern times
been “forcibly seized” en masse. It is true
because Australia is the only country like
itself. Otherwise the allegation has no mean-
ing. Water has never been a final protection
to any people or country if the other party
could float with safety. There was water
between Rome and Carthage; and a micro-
scope is wanted to find Carthage. There was
a vast expanse of water between where
Cortes came from and Mexico. There was
even more between England and Portugal
and France on the one side and India on the
other. And for purposes of forcible seizure
the ocean mattered mighty little when the
Boer Republics had to be invaded. If the
idea of the Worker is that no matter what
happens the sea is an impenetrable armor for
Australia, The Bulletin takes leave to
suggest that its cocksure friend is browsing
on delusions. Past experience, when men
.set forth to war in coracles and barques and
all sorts of tubs, and present occurrences
when floating fortresses, submarines and
high-powered steam transports are in the
picture, throw _ ridicule on the supposition.
So long as a friendly navy is on top to scare
anyone off, then Australia is not in danger of
a great invasion. The moment that navy is
not on top and another navy is available to
aid and abet an invader, Australia is open
to trouble. The opposite opinion can only be
held by refusing to look at unpleasant facts.
Invasion is a horrible thing to think of. It
is natural enough for people living in a part
of the world distant from the cult of destruc-
tion to find it difficult to imagine schemes
being hatched to blow them up. But that
does not prevent the schemers getting to
work. Nor will it, until mankind arrives at
a new stage of thought and purges the world
of military ambitions and economic jealousies.
Human society is a long way from that stage
yet, and men must deal with things as
they are instead of fumbling round in a world
of dreams. It would be a relief almost
beyond expression in words if war could be
banished from the earth. Dread of the
hideous thing has blighted the human race
since the dawn of time. But it has always
been dread of a reality. If the German wins
this war, then as sure as day will dawn
to-morrow Australia within the lifetime of
men now living will be put to the test. Force
will stand enthroned as the sole measure of
Right and Justice in the World’s affairs. And
it is the bitter truth that before the world-
mastery of Germany the vision of Australian
unity and independence would crumple like
an egg-shell under a boot-heel. The Bul-
letin wishes it could be as certain that the
people who talk about the inherent invulner-
ability of the Commonwealth and about
modern Militarism’s guiltlessness of wanton
aggression believe a word of their poisonous
doctrine.
THE TWO DROMIOS WHO DON’T
RESEMBLE MUCH.
Australia and Canada have certain points
of resemblance. They are somewhere near the
same size; they are parts of the same
empire; and they are the two biggest isolated
fragments of empire. In the last respect
there has never been any fragment exactly
like them since Brazil cut the painter and set
up for itself. Also there is a certain simi-
larity of language. But about there the
differences begin, and within the last two or
three years they have been accentuated. Long
before the war opened the Canadian was sus-
pected of materialism. He was more addicted
to dollars than to theories. His prompt adop-
tion of compulsory service was part of his
materialism, and showed how impervious he
was to the finer shades of the doctrine of
liberty. He reasoned coarsely that men must
go to the war, and that there was nothing in
the voluntary principle, under which good
men went to the cannon’s mouth while Hun
agents, spies and supporters, anarchists,
I.W.W. men, crazy pacifists, cowards, time-
servers, shirkers, chronic office-seekers, pro-
fiteers and the like stayed behind and
snatched at the control of affairs. His policy
would have sent Judd and politician Bren-
nan and preacher Roseby to the trenches
just as cheerfully as it sent Carmichael,
supposing the last-named required sending.
But the Canadian went further. He has
long been troubled with the idea that the first
business of an artisan of any kind is to do
more work and better work than the
fellow in another country ; to do it with less
effort by reason of better machinery and more
intelligenceand to be adequately paid for it,
He knew that war was a time of high prices
and great scarcity of goods, and that the
world would, as in previous big wars, be
divided into two classes—the cormorant who
collected the high prices and the worm who
paid them. He resolved unanimously to be
the cormorant. The last few years are com-
monly described as the time of “The Cana-
dian Revolution,” and during that time the
Dominion’s production of goods increased so
fast that its exports boomed in this fashion:
Canadian Exports.
BEFORE THE WAR. I IN WAR YEARS.

1913 .. 89,424,000 1916 .. 223,800,000

In 1915 the country sold abroad so much
more goods than it bought abroad that it had
£33,304,500 to collect from its outside cus-
tomers. In 1916 it had £66,622,000, and in 1917
£111,170,000 to collect. Blushless and quite
unashamed, it made money out of the war
by sheer energy and industry and a prompt
snatch at the forelock of opportunity. It
sold £80,000,000 worth of cartridges, explo-
sives, iron and steel manufactures, vessels of
one sort and another and paper to the Allies
in a single year. Wages went up automati-
cally, and went far higher than ever before.
With so much money coming in as payment
for high-priced goods there was no need to
have Hughes and Cook and Holman and
six Agents-General and one High Commis-
sioner all begging simultaneously for loans
in London. Having learned self-reliance
under the policy, of heavy Protection, it put
up a record in its haste to make even war
pay.
* * ■ * *
There is a Scriptural saying to the general
effect that two women shall be grinding at a
mill, and one shall be taken with a bright
idea while the other shall be left in the
lurch. Australia, as the war progressed,
developed along different lines from the
Canadian. An early effort of its comic-
opera Government was a Law for the
Prevention of New Industries. It was
enacted that all new profits earned by
an industry in excess of the average profits of
the years immediately before the war should
be suspected of being war profits, and be tax-
able at 50 per cent, to begin with, and more
later on. Of course in a perfectly new indus-
try all the profits would be new profits, and
therefore war profits if the Act was con-
strued that way, so that the song-and-dance
Government could take most of the earnings
in case of success and leave the manufacturer
all the losses in case of failure. And it was
clearly explained that though, under the
miserable tariff devised largely in the impor-
ters’ interest, most new industries Were only
possible while the war restricted foreign com-
petition, yet the musical-comedy Ministry
specifically refused to alter the tariff and
assure that the bright fresh industry wouldn’t
be snuffed out by foreign competition when-
ever the war was over. In effect, the manu-
facturer asked ,a pantomime or harlequinade
Cabinet if he was expected to be simply a
warming-pan for the Hun and other outside
people, and the clown said that it might be
so. or it might not, while the pantaloon re-
plied that the matter was one for further con-
sideration. The columbine said nothing.
Naturally the number of people employed in
Australian industries diminished rather than
increased, which, by the way, was also the
case with the people employed in agriculture.
Instead of having plenty of manufactured
goods to meet all demands and a huge surplus
to sell for cash abroad, the depressed land
which runs its affairs with a Punch Govern-
ment and a Judy Opposition, is even more
dependent than before on imports, just at a
time when imports in many lines are unpro-
curable and in all lines are at famine prices.
. So Australia has drifted into a condition
in which it can hardly even build a house to
put itself in, owing to high cost and unpro-
curableness of imported materials, and in a
less degree to. high wages, multiplicity of
strikes and holidays and general break-down.
In the biggest city the amount spent on new
buildings in 1917 was less than half the
figure for the year before the war, and
owing to increased cost the amount of new
accommodation provided w r as probably less
than a quarter. In many country towns
houses are almost unprocurable. The rail-
way service, has been grievously curtailed
because rolling stock can’t be imported, and
the materials for building it here can’t be
imported either. The shifting of the wheat
surplus is more than a year in arrear for
lack of the ships we don’t build, and the job
of railroading the wheat to the ships grows
more difficult. Public works are slowing
down for want of imported loans and im-
ported rails, and, anyhow, new railways are
of little use in the absence of imported
engines to drag imported trains along them.
The Sydney tram-cars that run a shrunken
service are being painted a new color because
the old brown paint can’t be imported.
There is a difficulty about knitting socks
for’ soldiers because this great sheep country
is short of imported wool and the special
tax is lying in wait for any new man who
starts making it. The question of finding
gold to pay the foreign interest bill is be-
coming acute as anybody who remembers
when he last saw a sovereign in common
use may imagine, for this country didn’t
happen to earn 111,000,000 surplus sover-
eigns last year as Canada did by selling
munitions and other things to the Allies.
In a thousand ways the machine of our
civilisation is slowing down and tending
towards a stoppage. When the country com-
mitted itself to the policy of low tariff,
foreign borrowing, reliance on imported
goods and other people’s ships, and as few
local manufactures as possible, it decided
that when the time came to choose between
being the boss or the slave, the eater or the
eaten, the ’bus or the panting runner who
didn’t overtake the ’bus, the maker and
seller at bloated prices or the buyer and bor-
rower at bloated prices, the cormorant or
the worm, it would, in humble obedience to
the command of the foreign importers and
their papers and their politicians, assume
the wormy or ’bus-missing part. And its
absurd and acrobatic Government, instead
of realising the situation in the first, months
of the war and reversing the old policy even
at the eleventh hour, continued worming.
It worms even to this day.
* * * *
Still one branch of industry has pros-
pered. The Administration which runs
things on the lines of the two kings in “The
Gondoliers” naturally decided not to use its
Parliamentary majority to enforce the com-
pulsory service it believes in. Avoiding, as
usual, the plain and obvious front door, and
approaching its subject in disguise by the
back yard and the roof, after the manner of
the boy detective, it at last fixed up an
arrangement by which men who wish well
to Australia go to the war, and Hun sympa-
thisers and cranks of all sorts remain be-
hind to supervise public affairs and talk
insurrection with impunity. Perhaps it was
partly by reason of this fact that strikes in
Australia, measured by the number of work-
ing days lost, increased 400 per cent, be-
tween 1914 and 1917. Canada’s exports of
goods—the things it sold in return for the
othet fellow’s cash —increased 400 per cent,
in the same time. So in this percentage
there is one more point of resemblance
between the two Dromios who, in most
things, are so very unlike.
PEACE AND FREEDOM IN THE
PACIFIC.
In the national sense Australia is not really
interested at all in the islands of the Pacific.
But Australia has always been profoundly
interested in anyone else who may covet those
localities, and is so still. It is impossible
not to be interested in him. Hence the Com-
monwealth is compelled to take quite a lot of
notice of places which, except for this indivi-
dual’s yearnings, Australians would have no
concern about.
* * * *
“Hands off the Pacific!” is all very well
as a cry, but there is a practical side to the
business. If the phrase is interpreted
to mean that while other hands are to be
kept away Australian hands are to be thrust
out, and that the Commonwealth is anxious
to convert the Pacific into an Australian
lake, the subsequent trouble will certainly be
greater than The Bulletin cares to think
about. But if the idea is that restraints
upon buccaneering among the palms shall
apply with equal force to this and every
other country—that the islands shall not
become the medium through which policies
provocative of resentment and quarrels may
be followed —then there is a good case to put
forward for “Hands off!” That islands
should be mopped up by truculent Govern-
ments at a distance, and, under cover of per-
juries about their anxiety to “spread civilisa-
tion” and so on, converted into naval bases,
is something that Australia is obviously not
anxious to hear about. Such policies have
one object only, and that is to place someone
in a position of being able to use the afore-
said bases against Australian ports and ship-
ping. This is what Germany had in view
in the occupancy of Rabaul and Samoa. One
of the things to be determined by the war
now raging is whether the German is to re-
turn to those places. Unless he is beaten
he will arrive again, hungrier and stronger
in purpose than before. That is one reason
why Australia is deeply concerned about his
defeat, for to the Commonwealth a victorious
Germany with a navy cruising around Torres
Strait and the Tasman Sea would be a night-
mare of unimaginable horror. The “Hands
off!” doctrine would then be enunciated in
another language. But if by the grace of
Providence and the use of bombs the Ger-
man, lusting for territorial expansion and
fight, does not arrive in the Pacific, there
will still remain strong reasons why
“Hands off!” should get a hearing. Aus-
tralia is not the only country interested in
the Pacific being a peaceful sea. The United
States, Japan and China use the ocean, and
though most of the islands of the Pacific are
close to Australia on the chart, they are not

The interests of Australia, of the native
population of the islands and of the world
would be best served, then, by a League of
Nations guaranteeing the Pacific freedom
from filibusters and territorial monopolists.
This implies leaving the island peoples alone
to choose their own way of life and, inci-
dentally, of trade and all the rest of it.
Australia, for her part, has no more moral
right to go seizing, say, Fiji, or Maoriland to
appropriate Samoa, than any other country
has. To do so is at best merely an incite-
ment to someone else to grab another place
and the preliminary step to getting tangled
up in disputation with other parties who feel
they ought to be in the grab as well. At
worst it means Australia officially tolerating
the exploitation of brown brother and his


land and his labor, and neglecting the immense
job the Commonwealth has on its own pre-
mises. All this talk about the islands otter-
ing magnificent openings for “development
by Australian enterprise and there being
opportunities for stupendous trade differs
neither in tone nor in substance from the talk
of every brigand the world has heard of since
Naboth’s vineyard attracted attention. It
is, no doubt, true that certain interests could
grow fat by setting up in business on an
island or two, importing coolies or inducing
the Government in the rear to so tax the
local inhabitant that he must take a job.
But that is no reason why such business
should escape being called by its proper name
or why people who want to see a fair deal
all round .should have anything to do with it.
Otherwise what possible ground of quarrel
could anyone have with German ideals, or
what sympathy with the conquered and the
oppressed anywhere? In any case there is
plenty of room in Australia for all the
energy of the population, and far more need
for Australians to concentrate on the trade
and development of the Commonwealth than
to shirk that part of the national programme
and rush off somewhere else. The islanders
have rights as definite as our own; and
unless Australia is ready to recognise this
and to tesist being stampeded into steals on
behalf of special interests, the noise about
“Hands off!” will not be received with much
applause elsewhere.
Of course if Germany wins the war the
League of Nations idea will go up in the air
as far as Australia is concerned. Another
League will transpire, and it will wear a
spiked helmet. In the meantime “Hands
off!” has the germ of a policy in which Aus-
tralia is vitally interested; but let it be
thoroughly and frankly understood that
“Hands off!” does not mean “Hands on!”
for us or any other PoAver.
A PARTY TO DESTROY PARTY.
It was, of course, the hope of parties calling
themselves Win-the-War and National that
the returned soldier would be blind to the
political trickery and scheming for office
which lay behind these high-sounding titles,
and that he would in a dull German fashion
follow those who called themselves his leaders
to the poll or any other place they might
desire to bring him. But the soldier isn’t
like that. He looks the facts straight in
the face and sees that both Win-the-War and
Labor are cheating the country out of
needed legislative work by the folly of party
strife. For one moment in one State the
alleged National party did secure the support
of some young soldiers who stood in its
interests at a recent poll; but already the
foUy of that move is recognised by the great
body of returned men, and a new Soldiers’
and Citizens’ party sets forth its desire ‘’to
keep the soldier sentiment from being ex-
ploited by any party at present in existence
by co-operating with patriotic citizens to use
that sentiment of self-sacrifice foi* the
development and protection of Australia.”
This is solid ground to stand upon, and
ground of big hope for the CompKinwealth.
Such a party, bent on the destruction of
party, was bound to come ; and that it should
rise among the soldiers themselves at the
moment when the Labor party is most care-
fully and enthusiastically destroying itself,
and the alleged National party is a flat
fatuity without purpose beyond eating the
bread of office, is all very much to the good.
* * * *
The first proposal on the new party’s
political programme is Proportional Bepre-
sentation. Proportional representation is a
means of getting accurately at all the views
of the democracy by giving a voice to minori-
ties. But that alone will not demolish
the party curse. In Tasmania a similar
scheme has worked out in endless political
deadlocks, proving that as between the
claims of Tweedledum and Tweedledee
the public mind is about evenly divided.
What the soldier democracy which aims at
getting the very best possible deal for this
continent should strive for is not a perfectly
just and equitable choice between Tweedle-
dum and Tweedledee every three years, but
a perfectly just and equitable choice between
right and wrong at any and every moment
of the Commonwealth’s existence. This is
to be secured not by proportional represen-
tation nor any other sort of representation,
but by the direct vote of the people upon the
questions concerned, added to a system of
Elective Ministries. With the popular initi-
ative of questions to be submitted to the
referendum, party, as we now know it,
could not exist. There would be fresh
groupings of politicians on every question
submitted; and no refuge would remain at
all for the mere trickster and office-seeker.
The business of the advocate of refoimi
would be to persuade the people by plain
argument. He could create no combine in
restraint of good sense by any sort of device.
This is the real direction in which the re-
turned soldiers might effectively clean up
the mess we call politics.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Bolshevik Bank, Unlimited.
There are some wonderfully original finan-
ciers abroad these days. For instance,
Catts, M.H.R. of N. S. Wales, is at large
and representing a big Ma State constituency
by a solid majority. And this is an airy
trifle which Catts, M.H.R.. wants to have
embedded in Labor’s Parliamentary pro-
gramme :
(1) That the Commonwealth Bank be a bank of
issue, deposit, exchange and reserve.
(2) That all private banks and companies be
compelled to deposit their reserves in the Common-
wealth Bank.
(3) That the Commonwealth Bank act as clearing-
house for all Australian war credits.
(4) That all war stocks and bonds be consolidated
and redeemed by the Commonwealth Bank at a
regular rate of, say, £40,000,000 a year.
The Commonwealth Bank is, of course, a
bank of exchange, deposit and reserve
already. Every bank is or tries to be. As
for making it a bank of issue, it and all
the other banks are already issuing Federal
Government notes in any quantity to every-
body who wants money and can show an
honest and solvent reason why he should
have it. Unless the Commonwealth Bank
is to start an issue of its own in competition
with its proprietor, the Commonwealth it-
self, it is hard to discover what is meant.
And what would be gained by having two
kinds of notes issued by one authority on
one security-—the public credit —is also hard
to discover. It would certainly cost a lot
of extra printing. The idea of making all
“private” banks and companies deposit their
“reserves” in the Commonwealth Bank is a
large matter. If reserve funds are meant
they are invested in all sorts of things
besides cash —buildings, mortgages, lands,
discounted bills, loans with or without
security, advances to build houses, advances
on crops, stock-in-trade of all sorts, ships,
wharves, tanks, cattle, horses, sheep and
other things too big to go into the bank door-
way. They can’t be kept in coin* for there
isn’t enough coin tb keep them in. So a
concern like the Adelaide S.S. Co. would
have to deposit a couple of ships on the
counter, and other concerns would have to
lay a plantation or a sheep-farm in Denison
Miller’s extended hands. If they were
expected to lodge the value of their reserve
funds in money there would either be a
frightful sacrifice at forced sale, with hun-
dreds of concerns selling at once, or a
frightful borrowing at the kind of rates
which prevail when hundreds of concerns
are driven to borrow simultaneously and
buyers are non-existent. If only cash re-
serves are included in Catts’s programme
things would be different. Even very wealthy
trading concerns have no cash reserves
except the change in the cash-box; their
liquid assets are at current account in the
banks, and while they are there form part of
the banks’ cash reserves. Supposing, then, all
banks were required to hand over their cash
reserves to the Commonwealth institution
no great harm would result except that,
whenever- a customer presented a cheque for
wages or anything else, the manager would
dance a doleful jig and say that there was
no money, for Denison Miller had it all.
Whereupon wages would cease and industry
be suspended. The Commonwealth banker,
as a result of all this, would have on his
hands about £20,000,000 in gold, some silver
and copper, and more paper money than was
ever seen in one heap before. He couldn’t
earn interest on all this, for business would
be partly dead and partly a raving lunatic,
and he couldn’t simply steal the money, giv-
ing nothing in return, for if he did he would
lose his self-respect and never be able to
look his female relations in the face again.
Then an immense proportion of the war
debt is payable in gold only, and how to
wipe out £40,000,000 a year and the interest
with only £20,000,000 in all has not yet been
discovered. The debts might perhaps be
“consolidated” at 41 per cent, by making a
present of 1 per cent, to the holder of low-
priced securities and prigging 1 per cent,
from the holder of high-priced ones, where-
upon one would say that the Commonwealth
was a fool and the other that it was a high-
way robber. And the debt doesn't really
require to be consolidated any more than a
rainbow requires to be soled and heeled ; all
that is necessary is to pay off the liabilities
as they _ fall due. One way and another
Catts is suggestive of the balance-sheets
that St. John dreamt of on the isle of Pat-
mos. And, incidentally, his programme is
almost to a dot that with which the two
awful wild Catts of Russia. Trotsky and
Lenin, reduced the whole financial system
of their country to beggary and hash.
«
Beeby, Pecksniff and Co.
It causes a pain in that lucid interval
between the end of the waistcoat and the
beginning of the pants to read the statement
of N. S. Wales Minister Beeby re the high
nrices of meat, etc.: —
The only direction in which the Legislature can
move in matters of this kind is by cheapening tran-
sit, creating central markets in the metropolitan area,
and in other ways trying to bring the producer and
consumer closer together.
Well, and what have the politicians done?
There was _an attempt to create an Aus-
tralian capital on the Snowy River on the
ground that that fast stream represented the
most reliable mass of water-power in the
State, and by reason of its fitness for cheap
manufacturing it would easily draw a large
population right alongside a large meat sup-
ply, and, incidentally, create a splendid asset
in the shane of a big city of which the people
could be sole ground landlords. This magnifi-
cent scheme of land settlement, decentralisa-
tion and Public Enterprise was squashed by
the furious opposition of N. S. Wales politi-
cians, because it might diminish that rush
of people to Sydney which is half the cause of
the meat problem. Then it was mentioned
that there was a splendid harbor at Port
Stephens, and if the North Coast railway
touched there a city of some sort, with the
State as sole ground landlord, couldn’t help
arising unless it was forcibly prevented
by the faking of railway rates and the
denial of a few wharves. That would have
brought another lot of consumers closer to the
producer, and incidentally it might have made
tie North Coast railway pay. Naturally a
gang of blatant hypocrites wasted the public
funds on taking the railway round Port
Stephens in fear the rush of people to Syd-
ney might be checked. Sane people grow
weary of listening to the song of the Peck-
sniff bird about shortening the distance
between the producer and the consumer when
all the time the country is being plundered
and swindled to keep them apart.

If Only the Kaiser Had Grown
Cabbages!
“George Street” preaches the gospel of
Every Man his Own Greengrocer:—
The ancient and wicked gag that war is a neces-
sary evil because it keeps population down to a
reasonable level is often voiced these days. Malthus,
at the end of the eighteenth century, said some wild
things about the dangerous increase of population;
and now Knibbs, Commonwealth Statistician, devotes
a book to the business of proving that the world will
soon have too many people. Knibbs is more moderate
than Malthus ; but his estimate that the numbers
double every 60 years is still very hard to accept.
On such a theory small, healthy island populations,
which have been little affected by disease and not at
all by war, should during the centuries have so in-
creased that there would have hardly been standing
room for a blade of grass between their boots ; but a
very slight emigration to larger lands has maintained
the freedom of the garden patch from being tram-
pled under, and has even left room for the goat
and cow.
Granted, however, that with disease abolished,
infants properly eared for, the span of life extended
by attention to the rules of health and a reduction
of the pressure of life at every point, the natural
increase of nations would be very rapid, why
fear that there would be no room for that larger
world-population? By plain demonstration it can be
shown that even in temperate climates where crops
are long in coming to maturity one acre of closely-
cultivated land will perpetually maintain—even
allowing for occasional failures —a family of four
persons. In the tropics and sub-tropics still less
ground is required ; but taking four to the acre of
rich soil as a basis, 425 million acres could be made
to maintain the whole present race of men. The
single State of Brazil, in the watershed of the
Amazon alone, could supply this extent of rich soil.
So the danger of overcrowding the planet is not
exactly pressing.
Australia, with its handful of people scattered
about the south-eastern corner, is certainly in no
immediate fear of having too many people to feed.
Without any exaggeration, the whole white popula-
tion of the earth could find homes and comfort in
this continent; and there would still be room for
generations to come without resorting to the mad-
ness of war or the aid of hideous diseases to thin out
the ranks.
On mere economic grounds, war is a most extrava-
gant mode of securing standing room; and the time
devoted to hammering cannon and making explosives
would be better spent in pounding the rocky moun-
tain side into fertility or carrying water to the
desert. For neither war nor disease make a good
choice in their selection of victims. The unfit from
their point of view may be the fittest in the realm
of intellect; and it is by the brain rather than the
boot that mankind must continue its march to greater
things.
Further, it is not by any means proved that war
does seriously reduce the population. As if by way
of rebuke to the destroyers, Nature always seems to
make up the deficit of human life with astonishing
rapidity.
Still, the point raised by Malthus, and now
emphasised by Knibbs, has some importance in view
of the world distribution of foodstuffs. The food is
here, the growing multitudes can be fed; but with
the increase of cities and the calamitous massing of
human creatures into restricted areas famine is a
real and ever-present menace. The recognition of
one great principle alone can save humanity. The
people must get near to the soil and keep near to
the soil. So deep and tremendous is this need that
it becomes a religious and moral question rather
than a merely political one. Old Thomas Carlyle
declared that to know anything at all about a sub-
ject a man must be morally related to it. No man
is morally related to his daily bread who does not
know where it comes from and how to grow it. The
relation between food and thought is a very inti-
mate one; and the divorce between the people and
the soil must in the end be fatal to any nation.
Revolutionary as such a proposal might seem, and
ridiculous as it might be held by the pseudo-
economists of to-day, the real world-reform which is
needed most of all is the abolition of trade in food-
stuffs. Let it be added to the Ten Commandments —
and not added at the bottom, but at the top of the
list—that every man as a religious duty should by
his own labor grow his own food. That would
occupy probably three hours a day of his time;
the rest of the day he could if he pleased build
houses or work in a factory or write poetry; but
the reform would make him a man and the nation
to which he belonged a nation of men.
Further, it would settle forever the restlessness
which creates wars. The Kaiser with good honest
sweat on his brow, as he plied the hoe among the
beans that were to feed the princes of the house of
llohenzollern, would never have dreamt his dream
of blood. There is a peace in growing cabbages that
passeth understanding. And such world-reform would
adjust population always and under all circum-
stances to the food supply. John Bright showed
that the price of the loaf affected from year to year
tiie number of marriages in Britain. How much
more would it be affected by the condition of the
garden patch and the extent to which the woman
took up the forgotten arts of real domestic economy!
Marriage reformers insist that no man who is
unfit for war should marry. It is a poor test and
Nature is ready to provide a better. Let no man
marry who is unfit to raise the food of a family
from the free soil. Get it down to that, and the
world will have nothing to fear.

The Only Valuable Baby.
Dear Bulletin, —I know of nothing more
calculated to make a decent person feel as if
he had eaten too much bad dinner than these
people—very many of them parsons—who
clamor for more birth-rate. There are two
aspects of the case. First, there is the
effective birth-rate, which consists in having a
reasonable number of healthy children and
keeping them, alive and training them to be
good citizens and citizenesses, so that
there may be a steady increase of good popu-
lation in those countries which have space
and food for more population. In this re-
spect Australia has about the best record
in the world, and the record is still improv-
ing. Then fheye is just the birth-rate—the
production of the largest possible number of
children, regardless of what comes after.
And it is just the birth-rate that these par-
sons and their kind are always clamoring
for. The races which do best in this way
are the beastly races. They may be high
mentally or they may not. but morally and
spiritually (if the term may be allowed)
they are low. It is because the Hun,
especially the Prussian Hun, has all the crude
birth-rate qualifications that this preacher
class is so anxious about that he makes rape
a science in every country that he invades.
He has more of the animal qualifications
for birth-rating than the Briton, the
Irishman, the Frenchman, Greek, Italian,
Spaniard or Portuguese and their North
and South American offshoots. Next to
the Hun comes the Russian, who is also
a backward person. The West European
has done hideous slaughters in war-time
when he was seeing red, but the worst stories
in his history have concerned Hun contin-
gents serving in his armies. It is because
the Hun is so great on the birth-rate that
ladies in England are toiling on the manufac-
ture of innumerable baby-clothes for the
compulsory infants of French and Belgian
women and girls (nuns included). Augus-
tus the Strong of Saxony, with his 400
offspring, is a typical Hun hero to this day.
Also there is a Hun legend that the
Guelpiis started with a lady who had 22 or
more infants at a birth. Running abreast of
the Hun is the African—not the Egyptian,
who is a person by himself, nor the Arab,
who is a comparatively gentlemanly intruder
from Asia, but the plain nigger. His crazy
lust for women —especially white women —is
proverbial. Some of the peoples with vast
and hog-like birth-rates show very little in-
crease of population because the death-rates
are also exorbitant, but that isn’t the mat-
ter at issue. What our impious folk demand
is just births —stacks of births like litters of
young pigs.—Yours in anger and contempt,
Henry iioksecollar.
♦ ——
Bash.
The fact that the industrial side of Labor
in N. S. Wales, by a majority of its del-
egates, has committed itself to resolutions
which mean opposition to recruiting, aban-
donment of its own army and repudiation
of the attitude of British Labor on the war,
is, after all, only one sign of great changes.
And it is not the most striking sign either.
Far more important to the Australian
democracy is the evidence given during the
last big strike, and since, that Labor is
getting on to a platform of one plank. That
plank is branded “Bash.” No doubt there
is a lot to be said for Bash, so long as there
is something behind it. The bashing of
sweaters and profiteers and loafers is holy
work. But indiscriminate Bash is another
thing, and it is this that Labor is getting
tangled up with. Labor came into being as
a critical and constructive body, with prin-
ciples which made it the most suggestive
force in public life. It aimed at securing
the democratic control of affairs and the
administration thereof in the public interest
—at orderly coherent reform in the interests
of social justice. Now it is getting to the
stage of saying: “We have been going on
the wrong lines. Let us have a class war.
Let us upend the whole caboose and by
making chaos make progress.” This is the
gospel of despairing futility. It is the denial
of democracy. Jt means plunging into
Reaction. If persisted in the immediate
consequence must be to turn every Labor
candidate for Parliament into either a liar
or an anarchist.
“Direct Action.”
It is foolish to be led away by phrases; much
better to get down to definitions. For in-
sance, that “Direct Action” about which
so much is heard these days is Plain Murder
in the long run. The people who killed Dom
Carlos of Portugal and his eldest son, and
tried to kill the old Don’s wife, alluded to
the event as Direct Action. And the term
has done service as regards every other pro-
minent slaying of recent years. It means
taking the management of things, by means
not provided for in the Constitution, from
Somebody and giving it to Somebody Else.
There must be a show of force to overawe
Somebody. If he won’t be overawed but
resists, there must be fighting and killing,
perhaps a great deal of killing; and there are
side-butcheries which aren’t in the pro-
gramme, for the hoodlums who care nothing
for either cause take the chance for private
loot and rape and revenge. Direct Action
has been used to overset the rule of an auto-
crat, an oligarchy or a church. Then the few
were sacrificed in the hope of benefiting the
many. In Australia the rule is in the hands,
not of the few, nor even of the many, but of
everybody. The principle of one-adult-one-
vote is the last word in popular government
There can be nothing beyond it unless every-
body gets two votes instead of one, or unless
the franchise is extended to infants and
beasts. So Direct Action must be the rising
of the few, the only people who can rise, to
take control from the many, the only people
who can be risen against. It probably means
an awful amount of murder, for the many
who toiled so long to secure absolute control
of their own affairs will object bitterly
when the leaders of a raving minority start
to make themselves a coterie of dictators. If
Direct Action isn’t merely the froth of a
handful of overgrown boys playing a game of
tin soldiers, then it signifies bloodshed for cer-
tain. There is nothing else that it can sig-
nify. And it takes a terrible amount of blood-
shed to suppress a majority fighting in the
cause of freedom.
Hang Work!
Who didn’t feel suddenly like saying, “Hang work f
Hang pettiness! The war’s the thing.”— Sydney
Tel eg n a i'h (11/6/’IS) in a spasm of enthusiasm
about the march of departing soldiers through Sydney.
The paper’s intentions were good, but some
people are inclined to think that work has
been too much hung already. As a case in
point, it was reported the same day that the
shearers had been ordered to strike at Bloom-
field (Blackall district, Queensland), and
though they didn’t know that they were dis-
satisfied and hadn’t been informed what the
trouble was about, yet, not being free agents,
they had struck. The report added that a
much bigger strike is supposed to be pre-
paring for August, and the activity of
I.W.W. agents is regarded as evidence. So
in the name of freedom the worker is ordered
France.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Should Paris fall before the scourge of
shame
That marks green Europe with the stripes of
blood,
Not yet shall sink that high and holy flame
That shone on hope uplifted o’er the flood
Of Revolution drowning wrongs and thrones.
France shall remain—the France of splendid
dreams —
Not wrought in iron bars and carven stones,
But as a garden of the soul whose streams
Lap flowery banks of thought and sacrifice.
Oh, France is grander than the voice of guns.
More potent than all empires, though the
price
Of glory be the blood of half her sons!
And when the ruin and red lust shall cease,
Freedom and France shall be twin names
for Peace.
!n.s.w.

about ns if he was a subject <>f the Czar in
the days when Czars were in full bloom. It
is not his to reason why; if he doesn’t obey,
he is labelled a “scab” and a traitor and a
person who is worse than a friend of the
linn. The latter flourishes almost openly
and never gets anything worse than mild
reproof; but the man who disobeys the com-
mand to leave off work is anathema. Nowa-
days the I.W.W. or pro-Hun minority has,
by organisation, push and effrontery, gained
a big hold on the Labor machine, and it
begins to look very much like a case of the
pro-Hun, with the arrogance of a Prussian
junker, ordering his servant, the free Aus-
tralian, to stop production so as to weaken
and paralyse and disorganise this large sec-
tion of the British Empire in the interests
of Germany. Taking all things into account,
then, this is no time for a bright and cheery
non-Hun paper to “hang work.” No country
is likely to win a war by working imported
and often rather antiquated machinery 44
hours a week, with many holidays and many
strikes and an occasional “go slow” policy
thrown in; in fact even before the war Aus-
tralia wasn’t earning its own board and
lodging and expenses, so that whenever the
influx of foreign loans slowed down seriously
distress set in. Now the departure of many
workers for the Front, and the greatly in-
creased striking habits of those who remain,
and the lack of new imported machinery,
have made things worse than ever. If Syd-
ney Telegraph, in a joyous moment,
“hangs” the little industry that is left it is
proposing suicide.
The Negotiations in the Shambles.
After his big push from St. Quentin
towards Amiens the German quickly switched
on the tornado in a fresh locality—from
Givinchey northwards to Dixmude. While it
lasted the damage was considerable. After
the rush, and the enemy had got his second
wind, he surged across the Chemin ties
Dames, got punched in the vicinity of Rheims,
pushed down to the Marne, and facing west-
ward seriously mauled the French army
along the front running to Soissons. Held up
fin this locality by a reinforced defence, he
promptly started operations in the next sec-
tor with the object of crossing the Aisne and
beating Foch out of the salient running up
to Noyon. After terrific fighting the Allies
were able to say that the move had been
checked. All the same, the enemy gained
some advantages, which, though limited,
widen his elbow room. The net result of the
four operations up to the beginning of the
week was that the German liad (1) drawn
nearer to the sea, (2) moved closer to Paris,
and (3) lengthened the fighting line for both
sides. Each of these is less pleasant for the
Allies than for the enemy. It is explained that
Ludendorff and co. are disappointed with
the rate of progress, and that the enemy lias
suffered losses out of all proportion to his
gains. This may be true. Also it may just
be. a convenient yarn. Certainly the same
things were said by the Germans about the
French advance in the Champagne and
Haig’s progress on the Somme and at Pas-
schendaele ; and most likely with equal truth.
Exactly what Ludendorff has on his time-
table can at best be merely a matter of
speculation. As for liis losses —well, neither
side goes into much detail. The main ques-
tion at the time of writing was in relation
to where the German would hit next. A spot
considered likely to be assaulted any day is
the valley of the Somme, towards Amiens.
Prince Ruppreciit is said to have an enor-
mous force thereabouts, and the inducement
to the force to strike seems great, for it is
not. much use trying to make out that Haig
is in a particularly comfortable position
there. What is very probable though is that
Haig has a bigger force thau before, and as
with one calamitous exception the British
divisions have taken a bloody toll when the
German attacked, and stood fast on their
ground, the enemy may not consider the
time to be yet ripe for trying to reach the
water. The probabilities are that he is more
anxious to get within sight of Paris, and,
for the present, keener on bleeding the
French than doing anything else. There is
a terrible and understandable purpose in this.
Meanwhile by way of variety the Austrians
lately launched a battering-ram at the
Italian Front, where they appear to have
been hit back hard. At the same time there
are stories about the German navy being on
the verge of taking a trip, and of accumulat-
ing chaos in Austria. After four years’
repetition these speculations are becoming
a little familiar. Much more to the point
are the reports about continued arrivals of
A merican transports.
Red Tape.
“Reggie Rueberstamp” tells how it works:
It’s time we took off our coats and centralised or
co-ordinated some of our Government departments.
Take as an example one sub-department I know of.
One. Federal department pays the office rent, one
pays the electric-light accounts, another pays what
we will call “supplies,” and so it goes on until it
takes ju»t seven, departments and sub-departments in
Sydney and Melbourne to deal with the financial
side of a small, non-spending sub-department. The
employees are, paid their wages from at least four
different places. Then take the question of, sav,
office furnishings, involving an expenditure of £o.
A requisition is signed by A and forwarded to B,
who, after about four weeks to consider, replies to
A requesting (“owing to desire for war economy”)
that the matter be reconsidered. A replies that
the job is an absolute necessity, and B then rings
up various contractors, who swarm all over A’s
office preparing a quote which is forwarded to B.
B approves of one particular quote and sends the
approval on to C (his chief) in Melbourne. C sits
on it for a few more weeks, then consults D (chief
of A’s department), who, in 99 cases out of 100,
writes A for a report as to necessity. Eventually,
after probably four or five months have elapsed, the
machine clicks back approvingly from D to A. But
then A finds the Minister’s signature is required, and
•so back to Dgo the whole sheaf of papers. At
last all is ready and the contractors sent for. But
as six months have elapsed since the quote was
given, the contractor (on account “of the increase
in prices”) cannot do the job now under £7 10s.
And so it goes on. The awful circumlocution con-
tinues because, whenever a commission or any other
old advisory crowd of business men is appointed, the
wrong people are invariably called before it to
give evidence. Instead of calling on the clerks
and other pallbearers of the show, it is the chief
corpse who, in all cases, tells the commission that
the funeral is going along beautifully and no reforms
are needed. Take the present Commission on the
Defence and Naval Departments. A friend of the
writer has seen that Commission take evidence in
a couple of places it has visited and he hasn’t heard
of any but the heads (the very men responsible for
the existing state of affairs) called before it.

Is the Devil in Australian Timber?
The question of the use of Australian tim-
bers for Australian purposes requires looking
into. From time to time there lias been an
outcry about the destruction of trees to
clear the way for cows, and once a month, at
least, someone declares that the stuff going-
up in smoke is better for most purposes than
anything else in the world. Yet certain coun-
try towns are in despair because it is im-
possible to find material to build houses
except at a prohibitive cost. Also, when the
specifications for certain composite vessels to
be constructed in Australia were recently
examined it was discovered that foreign tim-
ber was prescribed for all but a few odds
and ends. Further, a. protest has just been
made to the Maoriland Government by Aus-
tralian timber merchants against a new order
forbidding the export of white pine and other
woods. “They state,” the report runs, “that
it is utterly impossible to supply from avail-
able Australian timber the necessary quan-
tity for box-making, let alone the "require-
ments of the building trade.” Lately, too, it
was stated that Australian forests provided
nothing that was suitable for making paper
pulp. Is the stuff that grows on our land of
no value at all, then, except for post-and-
rail fences? Our hardwoods seem all right
to the mere layman in these matters; Queens-
land pine looks suitable enough for nailing
together to make a butter-box or a, case for
rabbits. All round us trees are growing
much closer to our cities and railways than
the forests of Maoriland where the soft white
pine is obtained. There ought to be an expert
pronouncement on this subject. We want to
know whether the trouble with these timber
people is that they have got so much into
the habit of importing that they simply can’t
bear to erect a local milling plant or two, or
whether the Devil has got into Australian
growths in some way that doesn’t meet the
eye, and made them totally unfit for use.

One great, characteristic, outstanding feature
of war is dirt. Without dirt a battle would
have some resemblance to the heroic thing it
was once represented to be; for men can face
death and might even be uplifted in soul by
the bombs that separate spirit from body if
it were not for the dirt accompanying the
performance—the dirt in the trenches, in the
military organisation and in the civil life
behind. Dirt—prolonged, aggressive, unre-
mitting dirt —must always degrade; and
where it becomes master of the situation good
citizenship is almost impossible. It is about
time that tills view of things got considera-
tion in our economic arrangements. In con-
sidering the value of an industry, the im-
portance of a city or the prospects of a new
policy, dirt, should be fairly and honestly
weighed against possible cash returns. The
big factory system under which thousands of
men and women are congregated into huge
buildings and return from work to close-pent
dwellings in congested streets may make a
good showing in statistical returns; but
gauged by its capacity for producing dirt and
keeping the workers unclean, its record is
bad. Dirt, according to Tom Carlyle, is
matter in the wrong place. The human
matter which makes the citizenship of the
nation is.never so much in the wrong place
as when it is herded into great crowds ; and
a ll the plans for the future should aim at
the spreading of industrialism over wide
areas where sun and air and all the cleansing
and purifying influences might get in then-
good work.

While Britain is so hard pressed that it is
now sending men of 51 to the Front, some
good friend of Germany is suggesting reasons
why Peakce should continue to refuse to
accept a Highland regiment from Australia.
The Bulletin hasn’t much sympathy with
men who, though living in Australia, want
to mark themselves out as Highlanders,
Hibernians or anything else exotic. But it
faces this fact: there are thousands of people
in Australia who, perhaps because they
haven’t been long resident here, do take a
pride in being Scotch or Irish or French,
and if it is necessary to make concessions of
a name or a ribbon or two in order to get
these people to do their duty, by all means
let us make them. Every recruiter knows
that you can rarely get two recruits with
the same appeal. You have to come at them
all ways. Okciiakd, Minister for Recruit-
ing, being quite human knows that, and
supports the movement for both Highland
and Irish regiments. Peakce can still find
difficulties in the way. The sooner someone
convinces him that this isn’t a time to find
difficulties, but rather a time to find ways
of overcoming them, the better for us and
for our chances of success.
The old wile or dodge of the Freetraders
was voiced again by Sydney Telegraph
(13/6/T8) :
A loud lament, however, goes up in the forgotten
voice of flscalism over the refusal of the Government
to keep Parliament together until a new tariff is
elaborated for “the protection of native industries.”
....The Department, says Mr. Webster, is obliged
to restrict the extension of telegraphic and telephone
conveniences because the material, which has risen
in price from 50 to 300 per cent, and owing to the
shipping scarcity is in some cases unprocurable for
love or money. The building industry is seriously
hampered by the prohibitive import prices of slates,
tiles, galvanised iron and other things. Imported
food staples have risen enormously But the Pro-
tectionists of the old school demand a tariff to
block the imports of articles that there would be
no ships to bring here if the Custom Bouse was
turned into a free warehouse for imported merchan-
dise.
The incurable Freetrader of the old German
school remains solid on three points:—
(1) That the old low-tariff and often no-tariff
importing policy, which made this country so
dependent on foreigners for telegraph and telephone
material, building material, food staples and ships
to carry them and other things that, though no
enemy has set foot on its soil, it is being ruined by
famine prices, is a darned good policy.
(2) That it is better to endure these famine prices
and the worse ones to come than to encourage
“native industry.” Therefore it must be carefully
explained to the prospective manufacturer that, if
he wants to supply the shortage caused by the high
price of the imported things which the Telegraph
enumerates, and hundreds of other imported things,
and of imported ships to carry them, he will do it
at his own risk and loss. For the Freetraitor holds
that the old tariff policy is the right thing, and
when the accidental war interruption is over the
Bun competitor must find his market awaiting him
as of old.
(3) And even the proposal that a new tariff should
be passed to come in force at the end of the war, so
that the possible manufacturer may know right now
how he will stand when the Bun and pro-Hun im-
porters are no longer shut out by war conditions, is
a foolish device of the “Protectionists of the old
school.” For if such a thing was done the Australian
manufacturer, finding that he wasn’t to be a mere
warming-pan for the Freetraitor’s pet Bun, might
start right now to relieve the scarcity of things.
And -the sight of him doing that under such con-
ditions would make every real Freetraitor boil with
honest indignation.
In the years before the war Britain stood
for a steadily-decreasing and Germany for a
steadily-increasing proportion of our imports,
and the tariff that produced these results is
not to be lightly interfered with by Protec-
tionists of the old school.
Australia can get a good many hints from
John Rathom’s revelations. For instance:
Careful examination of our wireless reports showed
a constant and suspicious connection between many
large commercial and shipping houses in the United
States and the German Foreign Office. Investigation
disclosed the fact that the code number and combina-
tions of letters used by the German Embassy in its
messages to Berlin were in many cases duplicated
by messages sent out from the Atlantic Communica-
tion Co., the Hamburg-America line and North Ger-
man Lloyd line, and many other concerns. Starting
with this knowledge, it soon developed that the
great strength of the German propaganda svstem in
America was largely due to the fact that these great
commercial houses were nothing more than outposts
of the German Foreign Office, heavily subsidised, and
acting directly under the orders of their home
offices, which in turn took their orders from Foreign
Office officials... .The Hamburg-America line and the
North German Lloyd line made regular reports
through their home office to the Foreign Office in
Berlin. These great corporations were used also for
other purposes by the German and Austrian Govern-
ments and the Embassies in Washington. Truly, the
German Ambassador, Von Berxstorff, was not under-
estimating the boundless credulity of a democracy
when he once said in his Embassy, in a burst of par-
donable pride in his ability to make the American
people believe \vhat he wanted them to believe: “In
this land of unlimited possibilities everything is pos-
sible.”
Rathom’s revelations are a lesson to all
English-speaking- countries, and especially
to Australia. For what he says of the offices
in America applies to the German Foreign
Office outposts in our miclst
The great majority of the men working in these
establishments were German and Austrian aliens, but
they invariably included among- their general mana-
gers or directors several who had acquired American
citizenship solely to permit them to conduct their
propaganda work with more freedom.
Viewed in the light of the proved fact that
these shipping offices were practically out-
posts of the German Foreign Office, the
managers and directors stand convicted of
connivance in the German scheme of World
Conquest. The case against them is that
they remained in their jobs up to the
very moment of war, whereas they couldn’t
have continued to hold them had they been
loyal friqnds of the country they lived in.
“Norseman”: “The Wanderer’s” par. (B.
18/4/T8) about the new Dorrigo North
(N.S.W.I public school being threatened in
the specifications with ceilings of American
Oregon, though superior native woods art-
growing all round, recalls my friend’s ex-
perience. He was at a N, S. Wales Mallet-
school on the Murray, and there his pre-
decessor had made a couple of desks himseii.
and so kept down the State expenditure.
Not being a carpenter, and wanting six
more, my friend wrote to the Department
suggesting that the desks be made on the
spot from Murray Pine, mentioning the two
desks as clinching the argument. ■ But no!
Eight months later waybills arrived stating
that the desks required had been sent from
Sydney per Albury and Melbourne. Then
the things went to Swan Hill, to' be finally
shipped per river boat. There was no wharf
within five miles, so my friend had to get a
carrier to do his bit for 15s. The curtain
was rung down on the horrible farce when
another 10s. was spent in having the iron
legs fixed on. You can’t teach Dead Tape!
Campbell Jones, for some time past man-
aging editor of the- Sun (Sydney), has been
appointed now also a director. Jones was
one of the bright Argus men who helped to
burnish the Sun when it ceased to be the old
Star. He joined the Argus in 1898, passed
to the Sun in 1912, established the paper’s
new cable service the same year, and returned
to Australia as managing-editor in 1916.
From Repatriation Minister Millen: —
In a recent issue you refer to a statement by Vic-
toiian Chief Secretary Bowser that StucUey Hall had
been offered as a gift by an anonymous patriot to
the Repatriation Department, and that the offer had
been refused. No such offer has been received.
When it .materialises, unless accompanied by impos-
sible conditions, it will be promptly accepted.
If Australia hadn’t been so preoccupied
with the Kaiser’s riot and bloodshed more
interest would have been taken in the violent,
death of Catherine Tatum, who was fatally
shot in a women’s street row in Sydney dur-
ing May. Deceased had the characteristics
of ashe-fiend. She had fired at her neighbors
with revolvers, and laid siege to their houses
with stones. Once she tried to stab another
woman at the Central Police Court, and on
an occasion when her arsenal was short of
weapons she went for an acquaintance with
a corkscrew. If there was a bottle to swing
it was swung according to schedule, and her
husband testified that he had taken four
razors from her. The end of this sort of
thing was not surprising. The aggressive
female stopped a bullet herself and took the
count. The jury on the murder charge said
“Not guilty.”
So far as the Homebush (N.S.W.) Abat-
toirs inquiry has gone the bulk of the evidence
seems to suggest that they are an absurdly
slow, expensive and ill-constructed haunt of
dirty meat and blowflies. One good point
about them was that they were supposed to
be profitable, which is something, seeing that
out of 23 State enterprises 10 showed a dead
loss for last financial year. But the hard-
hearted Government Auditor mentioned that
whereas interest, depreciation, sinking fund
and insurance were set down as £15.000. in-
terest alone should have been more like
£48,000, so the place where the meat is
viewed with disrespect seems to have lost its
chief redeeming feature.
According to a London writer, H. A.
Spender, the late John Redmond expressed
the view that Australia would have carried
Conscription if Home Rule had been granted
to Ireland. Well, what about father Bull
trying it on the family?

“The Nigger” must appeal to Melbourne
audiences as a well-knit and powerful drama,
dealing with the liquor question in its
bearings on the U.S. negro problem. The
play, produced at the King’s. (Melb.) last
Saturday, was written by a high-minded
nigger of the type that figures in the name-
part. It is a sermon clothed in romance and
it is admirably acted and staged—a, show far
more intellectually impressive than anything
seen here since Ethel Irving appeared in
“Dame Nature.” Philip Morrow is the re-
presentative upright young man of a South-
ern State. Sheriff in Act 1, and afterwards
Governor. During his term as sheriff he
stands for the justice of the law to save a
black grandson of his old mulatto nurse from
being lynched for outraging a white gal.
Needless to say, the guilty pusson was in
drink at the time of the offence. Subse-
quently the question of heredity arises in
connection with Philip Morrow’s feeling
towards the darkies, whom he dislikes for
their innate savagery, but for whom he
claims fair play. He learns, later, that he
himself is a nigger in the Yankee sense
of the word. His giddy military grand-
father, having lost his white wife and her
offspring at its birth, foisted the baby of his
own pet mulatto girl upon the family, and
thus saved the estate from being inherited by
an ancestor of one Clifton Noyes, a wealthy,
blustering distiller in Philip’s district. Noyes
knew this whilst he was running Morrow for
the Governorship, but kept his knowledge to
himself. Old nurse Jinny also knew it. The
foisted baby’s mother was her own pretty
sister in the long ago.
■* * * *
, Georgiana, the heroine, has an even stronger
derry on niggers than her sweetheart Philip,
who has now been convinced that the root of
the racial trouble is nurtured by the liquor
which Clifton Noyes distils. So, as Governor,
lie decides to sign a Prohibition Bill which
awaits his assent. Noyes thereupon taunts
him with the black strain in his ancestry,
and mammy Jinny, confirming the truth of
the assertion, Governor P. Morrow sits star-
ts at the ruins of his ambition. He must
break off bis engagement to Georgiana in
the first place. VY hen he confesses the reason
she is horrified. The girl’s terrible emotion
shocks Philip mto forgetting the. exemplary
rectitude of George
Washington. H e
takes back the
truth ; swears he is
all white, and offers
to hug the lady as
before. She repels
him, and he goes
mad with passion.
The nigger strain
of savagery domi-
nates the white
blood in the man,
and he is proceed-
ing to be brutal to
his gazelle, when
an interruption re-
stores him to sanity
and th e curtain
falls. The rest is
mostly peace and
goodwill. The grief-
stricken Governor
is persuaded that
his mission in life
is the uplifting of
niggers, and he
commences by put-
ting his seal to the

she interrupted him he refuses. With
the black streak in him, marriage, he decides,
wouldn’t be a fair thing. He also makes up
his mind to confess himself a nigger to the
people, and, as a matter of course, resign
office,
* X- ‘ * *
Such a play demands convincing acting,
and, in a measure, compels it. Half a dozen
characters give reality to the story of Mor-
row, the Governor, and two others (played
by Tilden and Eardley Turner) are pictur-
esque figures of melodrama in the first act.
No subtle shades are required of Lionel
Belmore as the distiller, for he is always
boastful, argumentative, expostulatory or
threatening. But hearty sincerity makes
his impersonation a striking success. More-
over he is an excellent foil to Guy Bates
Post, whose artistic reserve and restraint are
essentially cold-blooded. The element of
“greatness” is in Post’s acting, insofar as he
suits the character to his- mannerisms,
rather than himself to the character. He is
a master of egotistical art, making no jiotice-
able oratorical effort, using only the irredu-
cible minimum of gesture, and expressing
full consciousness of his individuality with-
out obviously asserting it. His silent effects
in,the scene where Belmore first calls him a
nigger, and Katie Towers (as old Jinny) is
brought into substantiate the title, are fine
touches of realism, whilst the air of self-
righteous dignity in his chilly demeanour
gives intensity to the contrast when the lion
shakes the icicles from his mane and crushes
to him his captured female. It is
good to see a rarely appreciated Australian
actress like Miss Towers make a notable hit
in a first-class play. Her performance of the
old nigger mammy is marked in the strongest
scene. Miss Thais Lawton’s acting is inter-
estingly uneven, as it was in “The Masquer-
ader.” She has charming moments of light
comedy and her ability to rise to tragic
occasions is proved in the harrowing second
act. But there are times when her diction
is irritatingly artificial, one of these occasions
being at the finish of the play on Saturday
night. Raymond Lawrence, as the Governor’s
private secretary, is in the picture all the
time, and Greenaway', disguised as the origi-
nal Uncle Sam, imparts an air of all the
virtues to his graceful little sketch of Sena-
tor Long.
■ “Katinka,” at Her Majesty’s (Alelb.),
continues to reflect on the character of Rus-
sian ambassadors in general and Boris
Stroggoff in particular. The fact that his
first wife left him to join a Turkish pasha’s
connubial auxiliaries doesn’t in itself prove
his unpleasantness, but when the lady turns
out to be Olive Godwin, one feels that Boris
was. an awful barbarian to let her go.
** * *
At the Royal (Melb.) there is yet another
wmek for “General Post,” the plain straight-
forward little comedy which holds a mirror
up to snobbery in a distinctly apologetic
manner. The moral of it seems to be that
there is more joy in Heaven over one baronet
who repenteth than over ninety and nine
untitled citizens who never put on airs with
their tailor. When Graham Browne has
laid down the sword and the tape-measure
Muriel Starr will come along in a new
drama.
** * *
“Samples” is back again at the Tivoli
(Melb.) and will remain till Saturday. His-
tory is repeating itself in “Samples.” Nellie
Leach and Prank Greene sing to one another
through a thin pretence of a telephone. Work-
man puts his four subjects to sleep, and
Celia Ghiloni once more wants to know
whether Joan of Arc’s eyes from the skies
see the foe. If they do Joan must think that
the rules of warfare have changed for the
worse.

at Melbourne Bijou. Will Raynor and The

“The Garden of Allah” was switched on
at Melbourne Britannia on Monday, and
discovered Helen Ware and Thomas Santschi
in.some of the amorous close-ups that Robert
Hiehens describes. To-day Bessie Barri-
scale flourishes her humble devotion before
her unobservant lawyer in her best film to
date, called “Those Who Pay.” At the
Melba the din of coin in the pay-box is due
to William S. Hart. That belligerent cow-
man ventilates the carcase of the opposition
in the big gun contest, “The Primal Lure.”
David Graham Phillips’s story of “The
Hungry Heart” brings Pauline' Frederick
into notice at Hoyt’s Theatres, Melbourne.
It is the old yarn of the Infernal Triangle
made a little more interesting by Pauline’s
sumptuous heartache in the principal part.
Jack Pickford and Louise Huff are associ-
ated in the other Hoyt attraction. “Jack and
Jill.” The narrative hurries from New
York to Texas and contains much disturb-
ance for young Pickford in the middle and
both ends.

Waldron and Miss Macdonell, playing at
the Royal (Adelaide) did an unkind thing to
that large section of the public which does
not read much dramatic criticism. They gave
“Outcast” immediately after “Daddy Long-
legs,' and mystified a large number of citi-
zens who came for a second helping of
treacle. This drama of the contest for a
man between two women, both entirely un-
troubled by virtue, was brilliantly played by
fhe two leads and Beryl Bryant, with a little
help from Redgrave and Brampton. “The
Bing Boys” are at the Royal. The Tivoli
has given a week to melodrama, “The Con-
fessions of a Wife,” made the better bv comic
relief from Maud Goldspink and Darcy Kel-
way. “Fauntleroy” to follow. At the Majes-
tic, \\ right walks downstairs on his head, and
the De Bakers repeat their striking living
statuary work. Revue is promised at this
house. In pictures, Mary Bickford at Won-
dergraph is as popular a s ever; but the finest
thing in sight is the inside view of Germany
as faked wonderfully from Ambassador
Gerard’s book, “Four Years.” The patriotic
show, originally intended to buck up the
U.fc.A., is so much to local taste that it is to
be given a second innings at West’s.
“THE NIGGER." AT MELBOURNE
KING'S.
Philip Morrow (Guy Bates Post) displays
his black passion for Georgian a (Thais
Lawton).
At the Opera House (Sydney) this week’s
drama is luring custom under the title of
"Through the Divorce Court.” The story
is that of an English belted earl with a
young Spanish wife who is madly loved by
one Gusman Di Mendoza, the lady’s former
guardian. (None of the parties are men-
tioned in “Whitaker’s Peerage, Baronetage,
Knightage and Comnanmnfiw.’n To
the jealousy of Lord Penarth and cause him
to bring Dolores into uoume w.-a
himself, Mendoza plans a meeting between
his beloved and her “natural” brother, Leon
Di Valdez, the secret of whose birth the girl
has sworn to Her Dying Mother never to
reveal. Foiled in his first attempt to have
the husband discover his wife in Di
Valdez’s arms, Mendoza thinks hard, and
this time his devilish plan succeeds.
The heroine is thereupon ushered into
the Divorce Court, and, until the end of
a strenuous act, her future looks as black as
the approach of a southerly-buster. The
clouds roll by, however, in Act 4. Then
there are the usual reconciliations, and the
villain sneaks off weighed down by his
wickedness.
*** N #
Lord Penarth was played by George Cross
in a rather too restrained manner, while
Lorna Forbes made a very attractive but too
emotional Lady Penarth. A more subdued
tone at the end of Act 2 would have made
the curtain more effective. Rutland
Beckett’s Mendoza was quite good, and
Gerald Harcourt and Dorothy Hood (child
Sybil) were accorded a vote of thanks from
a packed house on Saturday.

“Within the Law,” revived at Sydney Cri-
terion, looks all the better for being a little
kindlier than of yore. Inspector Burke, of
the N’York police, is still an amazing and
incredible apparition, and Detective-Sergeant
Cassidy a wholly unbelievable person. But
owing to the declaration of war or something
they have their human moments, which is
just as well perhaps, or the democraev would
be wondering most of the time why Brother
Jonathan Wilson needed to leave home in
search of Huns on the other side of the
Atlantic. Anyway, it is possible that the
police business in “Within the Law” was in-
troduced as a sort of comic relief or as a
satire on the popular brand of fiction which
presents the American “bull” as a barbarian
addicted to snarling through the side of his

penny soul. Muriel Starr is perhaps as well
equipped to play Mary Turner as anyone
Australia has studied for a long time, and
much practice in the miseries incidental to
doing three years on the cooler “for some-
thing I nev-er-er did” have done her no
harm. Frank Harvey, as the bright, purpose-
ful son of the dreadful old rag-merchant, does
rather better than any of the rest of the

Norma Mitchell as the young person who
met Mary behind the bars, and later on got
away with a hatful of coin on a breach-of-
promise case. Miss Mitchell, who gets the
laugh of encouragement with great fre-
quency. has something akin to genius in these
unpleasantly humorous parts. “Within the
Law” stands sampling twice surprisingly
well.
“The Three Twins” continue to rage with
song and dance at Her Majesty’s (Sydney).
When the plot and the Twins' whisker's are
threatening to weary the audience an incon-
sequential song or an irrelevant dance breaks
out and revives the show and those who have
paid to see it. Weariness has a poor part.

Gerard’s story of his “Four Years in Ger-
many” is being told on the Town Hall screen,
and the Hun and his methods don’t show up
any better for the bright light that is thrown
upon them. The picture, which is excellently
produced, possesses educational and histori-
cal value, for no essential detail has been
overlooked by the knowledgeable and impar-
tial Gerard. A ray of sunshine has begun to
penetrate even the tragic existence of movie-
drama heroes and heroines. Comedy has
found them out, so we have George
Walsh, at the Lyceum, in a whirl called
“This is the Life,” a sequence of excitements
between the first whiff of dentist gas and the
extraction of a vicious looking tusk. Madge
Kennedy, at the Royal, sparkles in the mirth-
ful situations of “Nearly Married,” which
land her in the Divorce Court before the poor
girl has had her honeymoon. The Lyceum
screen show's Pauline Frederick trying a
taste of the other man’s love to satisfy the
cravings of “A Hungry Heart,” and ‘jack
I’ickford and Louise Huff brighten up the
same programme in “Jack and Jill” who
climb the hill of success. The Goldwyn Film
for the week at Sydney Royal is “Nearly
Married,” with cheerful Madge Kennedv in
the lead.
There is one Melbourne man who reckons
policewomen should be supplied with uni-
forms. The lady sitting next him on a
North Carlton tram dropped a parcel. He
accepted what he thought was a hint, and
picked up the bag like a gent., and while
stooping down contrived to let her know
that he had taken the hint that she was
that sort of woman. The result was a
charge of indecent assault and a fine of £2,
in default 14 days. The assaultive was a
policewoman!
Something like the sound of a wounded
elephant smote the welkin when a heavily-
jewelled dame was caught with a for-
bidden osprey at Flemington recently. The
brilliant ’tec. who had spotted the ornament
requested its instant removal; but the lady
shrieked that she wouldn’t, and with every
protest there was a sob. When she finally
consented to surrender, she tartly asked the
detective if his solicitude for the feathered
world embraced a colony df night-birds who
had burgled her cash-box a few weeks before.
It was a nasty jolt for the Force.

“Lance-Jack”: On King’s Birthday the
Vic. Railway Department spared no trouble
to see that picnickers and race-goers were
properly accommodated. There were no com-
plaints.' But things were different with 600
men who left for Sydney. They were neither
bookies, punters nor pleasure-seekers. They
were outward bound from Broadmeadows
camp, and they were reinforcements for the
Front. They included members of . the
Sportsmen’s Thousand and Italian reservists.
Those who got seats were packed like sar-
dines, and those whq didn’t had to stand in
full kit at least as far as Albury. Several
of them determined to get out at the first
stop, and pay their own fares to Sydney by
express. When a Melbourne newspaper asked
the Railway Department what it thought of
the scandal, the reply forthcame that the
THERE IS A LIMIT.
BEAUTY : “I’m doing my hit — I’m getting as
little dress as I can.”
THE BEAST : “Quite right, my dear, quite
right. But don’t let your enthusiasm
carry you too far.”
number of soldiers was greater than that for
which provision was arranged by the De-
fence Department. The Defence Depart-
ment, in its turn, said that the number of
troops was not exceeded, but that the accom-
modation asked for was “slightly below re-
quirements.” So there you are!
But the N. S. Wales Railway Depart-
ment is no better. During the last big strike
a returned officer had to see one of its poten-
tates about shifting some men between Syd-
ney and Liverpool. The time was arranged.
“It’ll be a special?” said the officer interro-
gatively. “No, no no,” said the Railway
boss. “Please don’t call it that. You see,
if we gave you specials we should have to
put them on, too, for the race people, and
we can’t spare them at present!” “And I’m
going away again to fight for worms like
that!” said the officer afterwards.
“Smokehouse”: Recently died at Steven
Island, in Torres Strait, an old neighbor of
mine, an ancient brown crone, the last of the
old stock and a link with the island’s super-
stitious and bloody past, taking with her the
secret of the whereabouts of a remarkable
diamond. Some 40
years ago, so the
legend runs, when a
windjammer was
w recked on the
island, the captain
brought ashore a
despatch-box, which
he never Allowed to
leave him. This ex-
cited the natives’
curiosity, and he was
forced to open the
case and show the
contents, which
turned out to be a
stone, said to be of
remarkable size and
brilliancy. Hepitched
some yarn about its
magic properties, and
as a result the local
pourri-pourri man de-
capitated the posses-
sor and got away with
the stock-in-trade.
This man shortly
before his death, con-
fiding to his next-of-
kin, the above-men-
tioned dame, that he
was afraid of the
stone and had buried
it, passed on the
secret of its resting-
place. Some years
ago attempts were
made by white men
to find the gem,
which the natives of
the island know as
“Fire E y e” on
account of the red
light it emitted at
night. After much
persuasion and many
gifts the old woman
pointed out the spot
where she said Fire
Eye was buried, but
no sign of it was dis-
covered and t h.e
chances are that it
never was anywnere near that spot. Some say
that it has been found, but the natives are
confident that it is still undiscovered.
“Burrundie”: Another home-made North-
ern Territory ordinance lately got a bang on
the nose at Darwin. In this case the usual
sly-groger was being biffed, when his lawyer
got up and remarked that, as the penalty
was £SOO and 12 months, or both, and as the
Interpretation Act had something to say
about such matters being indictable offences
and not matters of summary jurisdiction, the
information must be given the boot. “The
Crown” showed great indignation, but the
magistrate tossed out the .information as
requested. Then Gehenna broke loose.
Previous offenders who had been wrongfully
convicted got busy. Results —two writs of
certiorari, which have been upheld. Now
one man who paid a £2OO fine and did six
months has received his fine back, and as he
can’t be refunded his six months he wants
money—a few thousand to help him over
the next race-meeting. And there are others
waiting.

Australia holds its end up at the training-
camps in England as well as in the' field in
France and Palestine. At Durrmgton there
is an old-established camp for artillery
officers. Nowadays each “school” consists of
from 25 to 30 officers—as a rule, about four
or five Australians and Canadians and the
balance Tommies. An Australian had topped
each or the last four schools to the end of
March.
* * * *
“0.K.” in protest and exhortation :—-
The Agricultural Society of Victoria has decided
that its next annual show shall be “dry.” This
will mean sacrificing £SOO or so for the. sale of
liquor-bar privileges, but the lessee would need to
sell at least £7OOO worth of liquor to make a profit
on his speculation, and a public consumption of
£7OOO worth of beer and whisky is vaste in war
time, and of no moral or physical benefit to the
community—especially soldiers. Commonsense is
making steady progress. An agricultural society is
as much concerned as anybody else (save brewers,
distillers, hotelkeepers, magsmen and prostitutes)
in encouraging sobriety; and Governments will yet
have to confess that they are expected to put that
concern into general effect. This will mean aban-
doning the ancient fallacy that you can t make
people sober by Act of Parliament. Governments
would have thrown the fallacy overboard long ago if
the campaign had not been collared by the old pio-
fessional killjoys. But these have almost ceased to
count in the forced march of commonsense. Com-
monsense means patriotism; and as alcohol has
proved itself a deadly' enemy since the war started,
commonsense won’t have it. Reasonable republican-
ism “follows the King” for the time being. Un-
reasonable publicanism tries to push the other way,
and is being swep't back by the tide. Amen.
POETRY AND PROSE.
“Darling, is it possible such love can exist?"
“Honey, you are squashing my nose.”’
“Amalekite” : It’s about time the Victorian
Mallee had the “pinky” curse lifted from it.
The wise legislators who forbade pubs and
licensed wineshops ought to spend a summer
week-end on one of the Mallee lines and see
what the alternative is like. So-called
“Colonial wine,” diluted and mixed accord-
ing to local circumstances and the
saloon-keeper’s conscience, is deadly
stuff —one glass will just about
loose the chains of Satan in a man,
and two will render him an A 1
candidate for an asylum. But when
there’s nothing else to drink Cocky
naturally takes it on a day when
the heat pretty well melts his wag-
gon tyres. I have seen (and
heard !) some wild jamborees after
a meeting of the Progress League
or some such institution, held at the
wine-shanty beause it happened to
boast the largest and only room in
the place, with of course the inevit-
able “bob in” afterwards. The worst
feature is that mere lads can got
the poison, whereas in a properly-
regulated pub-license district they
would mostly be denied the chance.
A couple of years ago a meeting
of Anglican parsons at St. Arnaud
(with a bishop and archdeacon
amongst them) voted for the aboli-
tion of the wine-saloon and the establishing
of licensed pubs. But the Governments have
done nothing, and the wreckings continue.

“Cornstalk”: Maorilanders are never tired
of sneering at Australia for turning down
Conscription, and, if they think they would
have done anything else themselves, or that
it is calculated to improve the position, I
don’t mind; but I do kick when these
patriots have the gall to cast a slur upon the
Australian on the field. Col. R. A. Chaffey,
conmmanding the Canterbury district, un-
loaded himself of this at the Overseas Club’s
Empire Day demonstration :
Out of every 19 j boys sent from Maoriland only
one failed to reach the firing-line; while of the Aus-
tralian forces olie in every four failed to reach the
firing-line. This bore out what the chief men of
Maoriland were saying, that the training was sound
and good. I wonder if anyone has any idea how
many Maorilanders are prisoners. The last record,
some six weeks ago, showed that there were only
125. Compare that with Australia, who have 3400
prisoners in the hands of the Germans. Of course
they sent very much larger numbers, but still the
proportion of prisoners is ten or twelve times larger
than the prisoners from Maoriland. It either proves
that our boys go on fighting until there is nobody
left, or else they are so cunning that they take good
care they are not taken. The latter, I am certain,
is not the case.
This warrior has soldiered in Otago, Canter-
bury and Amuri, and he holds the M.L. Long
Service medal, so no doubt he considers him-
self more qualified to speak of the fighting
qualities of Billjim than, for instance, Bill-
jim’s cobber from the island that Chaffey
adorns (on parade). But the sooner the
M.L. Defence Minister asks Chaffey if he
thinks he is helping to win the war by
attempting to sow discord amongst the over-
sea troops the better. Nobody, I suppose,
can stop the ass from braying; but the
Minister can at least see that the ass does
not bray in any representative capacity.
From William Webster, P.M.G.: —
In your issue of 6th instant you complain of the
refusal of the Telegraph Branch to forward your
wire which stated that Henry Parkes was either a
Freetrader or a liar. Your allegation that such
action is akin to the censorship during the war is
Bui.i.ETiN-esque, in other words unsound, seeing that
Clause 96 of the Post and Telegraph Act of 1901
enacts that telegrams containing offensive words
shall not be transmitted. That clause has been
repeatedly used during the last 17 years, and rightly
so. No one would rest'ht such a message more
than The Bulletin, if addressed to the members of
its eminent staff. The obvious intention of the
paragraph is to pursue the usual Bulletin course,
i.e., to vent its spleen and animus on me personally.
Evidently it is a crime in the eyes of The Bulletin
for one to succeed in economically administering a
vast department during war-time; hence they use
every weapon, legitimate and otherwise, to destroy
anyone who dares to rob them of tiieir stock argu-
ment, viz., all are frauds except the mighty
Bulletin.
Mr. Webster over-rates himself. This paper
doesn’t know him “personally,” and is only
interested in him as the gentleman who loses
the mailbags and now declines to transmit
the people’s messages. As to The Bul-
letin’s message, by the way, it didn’t say
that “Henry Parkes was either a Freetrader
or a liar.” It didn’t mention Henry Parkes.
It didn’t mention anybody. Webster already
handles mailbags carelessly. This paper
trusts he won’t get into the same habit with
regard to the truth.
“D.D.W.” (London ) : Know the story of
the German prisoners who went on strike,
but got back to their w r ork like little quiet
mice because they were threatened that, if
they did not, they would have an Australian
SOMETHING WARM.
“Rotten service here. By the time you get
the food it's cold.”
“Yes, hut the charges are always hot.”
_ uard Jut over them? The genius who made
the threat was asked if the Australians were
cruel to the prisoners. “Not exactly what
you might call cruel,” he replied, “but they
make the Hun learn ‘two up’ and win all his
money from him!”
MID-JUNE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
There’s a breath of spring in the air,
With the winter but half-way gone.
Earth has a bloom to wear
And laughter trills from the dawn—
A song that is heartsome and sweet,
With dancing joy for the feet,
Blows lilting out of the dawn.
There’s hope in the old world’s heart.
Though the fires of Hell increase,
How long may they hold apart
The nations from dreams of peace?
Mighty the strength of their steel,
But the world begins to feel
The balm of the coming peace.
Spring clay in the winter’s cold.
Grim Mars sits limp , in his car.
The war grows weary and old
And the graves are many and far.
Weary of slaughter and death,
The world with a sighing breath
Turns to the dreams afar.

When on June 8 this old planet had a
spare moment to look up from its own red
business, it found it had a new neighbor.
And according to the wise men, the new-
comer has its worries, too. In fact, it is just
a stupendous worry, and nothing else. Nova
Aquilse is, at a guess, the result of a col-
lision between a dead sun, romping through
space at anything up to 100 miles a second,
and a brother scorcher, also hogging without
headlights; or between a dead sun and an
invisible nebula. The smash was so terrific
that it set the whole neighborhood blazing.
When this happened no one knows to within
five minutes; but Ernest Cooke, the astro-
nomer, opines that it was about the time of
James 1., and it has taken the light all these
centuries to get this far. For the rest, its
color is bluish-white, which suggests that it
is hotter than our sun, which is estimated
to exceed 10,000 degrees; it is more brilliant
than Nova Percel, discovered in 1901, and
probably the most brilliant since Kepler’s
discovery in 1607. But it seems to be grow-
ing less refulgent, from which it may be
argued that the fire brigades have got the
water on.

“Henry Horsecollar” reminisces:—
I have had adventures in my time. I have faced
six crocodiles at two yards range. They were in
the lake attached to the palace at Jeypone, and I
went to encounter them with a guide and a bag of
meat and a palace hanger-on who had to be paid,
and a boy who insisted on carrying the meat and
had to be paid, and four brown loafers who came
to help the boy and wanted to be paid. Then as
the crocodiles were asleep on the opposite shore a
partially nude person who had to be paid ran
swiftly and roused the gorged creatures with a
stick—l never saw animals whacked like that before
—and, knowing their duty, they came and rushed
at me in moderation. I was quite unarmed, but I
did not blench, nor did the boy with the meat. I
have met the baboon in his native lair by the Zam-
besi ; he was an aged outcast from the herd and he
ran or toddled for his life. He was more of a town
hanger-on than a baboon. I have encountered the
boa-constrictor where the fearful animal hangs out.
He was in an advanced state of decomposition, and
a colored person took me to him for a pair of
shillings. He smelled high. I afterwards heard that
he was a fraud imported from a distance after death. I
might have gained the Victoria Cross once at the
sale of a deceased soldier's effects. I have even
been mixed up with lions, for I put a little money
into a fund for the benefit of a Rhodesian farmer’s
widow, whose farmer had tried to kill two of them.
He really did kill them, but his Kaffir, who was
standing behind him with a spare gun, started
dancing in a frenzy of excitement, and the spare
gun went off. The Kaffir, I believe, was flogged by
tin? executors, but that didn’t bring his employer
back to life, and as the widow was an Australian
girl and was left in poor circumstances I did my
bit along with Boers and other well-wishers. I have
been at fairly close quarters with wolves (unless
they were dogs), only I was in the train and the
wolves weren’t. And I have argued with a large
and forbidding monkey for the use of a seat on a
lonesome railway platform where no help was in
sight except the nigger station-master. That was
in Rajputana, where the monkey is treated as a

friend, and will almost carry your bag for you if
you don’t take liberties with his tail. But in the
autumn of my stirring life I am glad that
I wasn’t in that church at Orange, where
the parson was preaching peace and submission, and
a shindy arose, and the pacifists fought the defence
party all over the holy edifice and in the street
outside, and refused to arbitrate or to suspend hos-
tilities, or to regard anybody as a brother—except
themselves. I' would sooner meet two decomposed
boa-constrictors than one passive resister. He has a
tendency to aim wallops at the lower stomach which
defies all rules. I am half-inclined to think that if
an army corps had been conscripted of Quakers,
passive resisters, pacifists, Peace Society men,, con-
scientious objectors, I.W.W.’s, pro-Huns, indiffCrent-
ists and cold-footers, and it had been put in the
front line under rigid discipline, Cambrai would have
been saved.
WHAT’S THE TIME?
GUSTAVE : “Quelle heure est-il?"
HARRYMAC (who has been trying to learn the language): “II est oh, it, look
at it yourself.”
“Macko” : After a couple of years in the
trenches of Flanders and France, I thought
a trip to the clouds would at least give me
a change of air, so I applied for a job in the
Aviation Corps. To my delight I got orders
to weigh in. I tipped the scale at 14st. 71b.
The officer shook his head. “Stop where you
are, laddie.” he said ; “we’re not sendin’ up

Adelaide Art Gallery has had a curious
find.. In 1882, a canvas by Wyllie, the
marine painter, was bought for it in London
by Poynter, now president of the Royal
Academy. Wyllie has just written to say
that there is another canvas at the back of
the frame, and that he would like it taken
out and sold for the benefit of a French war
fund which his wife is interested in. Mrs.
Wyllie adds“My husband had stretched the
picture over another beautiful one. You
know what artists are—or perhaps you don’t.
Well, rather than have th« bother of re-strain-
ing the back picture, ho let the two go
together.” The painting, of French fishing
boats, has been brought to light. It is not
nearly as good as “Our River,” which used
to hide it, but it will bring in a sizeable
cheque.

“Umntu”: Your whole-hearted Afrikander
has many pet bunions for others to tread on,
a. prominent one being that named equal-
rights-for-both-languages. On this the S’Afri-
can Railway Department seems unable
to escape treading. Some time ago General
Ilertzog had to. complain that the menu-cards
used in the dining cars were never printed in
Dutch, and the explanation that chefs had a
language of their own which was mainly
French hardly pacified him. The other day
the Department tactlessly came down on the
same corn again. A new line was to be
opened which had reached a temporary stoo-
ping place in the veld of a particularly
Dutch district. At the opening luncheon a
local champion severely criticised the Depart-
ment for choosing in a Boer district such an
English name for the terminus as “Pro Tern.”

“Bacon Stealer”: A block had occurred on
one of the many roads leading to the front
line in France. A Billjim driver, in a big
hurry to get through with his load, pulled up
with a jerk in rear of the long string of
transport waggons. Hailing a sergeant, who
was coming back from the front line, he
asked: “What have I struck, Sergeant—a
rest-home for horses?”
“Aus.”: Although we knew that horse-
flesh was considered something of a luxury
by the civilian population of the surround-
ing villages, it was looked upon with cold
disfavor by the Bill
jims in our platoon,
and each of us was
prepared to wager
the last dixieful of
stew that we would
know the meat if it
was served up to us.
One of the lads, hav-
ing just cleaned out
the two-up school,
invited the section
to eat at his expense
at a hash-house in
the vicinity. Mad-
emoiselle assured us
she had “plenty good
bif steak,” and we
were soon bogging in
to a hefty feed and
enjoying the change
from our usual bur-
goo. The tenderness,
flavor and quantity
of the meat were
bon. Next day w 7 e
learned that one of
our prads, having
broken a leg in the
transport the previ-
ous morning, had
been shot- and that
two of our push had
sold out to our Allies
at a franc per lb. That’s bow we got the good
bif steak!
* * * *
The “and—or” question which has been
worrying the S. Aus. Supreme Court for
half a year is settled at last. The trouble
was that an old Act of 1850, still in force,
said that additional evidence may be taken
on an appeal by consent of the parties “or”
order of the Court. But another copy of
the Act, apparently just as old and just as
authentic, says consent “and” order. The
difference is remarkable. In the one case
the parties to an action can proceed without
the Court’s leave, and the Court need not
wait for their consent. In the other the
whole lot have to be of the same mind. A
requisition on London has produced a formal
signed copy of the Act, deposited in the
Colonial Office; and that says “or,” which
settles the question.
“Wahsj”: Here’s another versatile Aus-
tralian ; and this one isn’t at the Front,
though it’s no fault of his. He was sent up
lately to take charge of a one-man school
near my tin-scratching show; and as Empire
Day came round, and the youngsters started
to talk about the fine time the big-town kids
were going to have with Ministers and
M’s.P. and mayors and returned V.C.’s, he
felt sad. “Never mind,” said he, “we’ll get
the lot somehow.” He solved his problem
when the five visitors and the 25 kids turned
up on Friday by introducing himself as “The
hon. member for Tin Show,” and calling on
himself for a speech, which he supplied.
Next he stepped off the packing-case and
stepped back again, this time, as teacher, to
conduct “Advance, Australia Fair.” The
Mayor and the V.C. followed; and finally
he impersonated the Director of Education,
congratulated the teacher on the success of
the function and graciously granted the kids
the remainder of the day off.

THE BOYS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Silent stands the callous ass,
Getting on in years;
He, when troops of soldiers pass,
Mocks at shouts and cheers,
Mingling his contempt for “gas”
With the slackers’ sneers.
Others stand, with folded arms,
Cheering now and then
Young recruits from shops and farms;
I just wave my pen—
I but dream of war’s alarms
Faced by fighting men.
For his mater and his dad,
For his manhood’s sake,
Goes the sturdy soldier-lad,
Game to give and take.
His big heart is bold and glad:
Mine with pain must ache.
Luck be with you khaki chaps,
In your martial stunt —
Workers, clerks, and “crooks,” perhaps,
Going to the Front!
You who go to fill the gaps
Help to bear the brunt.
Some of you must bravely die.
We stay free from fear.
Some who watch you passing by
Raise a feeble cheer;
Others grin, and others sigh,
Whilst the slackers sneer;
Others clap their hands —and I
Can but raise a tear.
VICTORIA.

Mr. Edward Branscombe, one of the leading Entrepreneurs of Australia, writes of
Clements Tonic that it is a medicine that all theatrical persons should use.
The Garden Theatre,
Bayswater Road, Sydney.
An important testimony from Mr.
Edward Branscombe, the well-known
theatrical and musical entrepreneur,
to whom Australia is indebted for
the visits of the Westminster Glee
Singers, Sousa’s Band, and the
famous Russian Instrumentalists,
The Cherniavkis.
IP
Mr. Branscombe was also the
originator and producer of The
Scarlet Troubadours, the first Cos-
tume Comedy Company to visit this
country, as well as the numerous
companies of Dandies which have
been performing in Australasia for
the past seven years.
TO CLEMENTS TONIC LTD.
As a consistent user of Clements Tonic for the past nine years I have pleasure in testifying,
through my own personal experiences, to its undoubted efficacy. j
The mental and nervous strain associated with all theatrical and musical touring work is an
ever-present source of trouble to those so engaged, and I have been no exception to this rule.
Particularly teas this the case during the tours of Sousa’s P>and and The Westminster Glee
Singers, the latter alone extending over an uninterrupted period of two years and involving a constant
demand on the nervous system.
This demand teas always unfailingly met by a course of Clements Tonic, and thei'e is no gain-
saying the practical benefits I have derived from its use.
If further testimony were needed I could add that my opinion is strongly substantiated by
similar experiences on the part of the many friends to whom I have recommended this excellent
remedy.

John Sarle Trew, who has just died at
Malvern (Vic.), aged 79, had a father who
was once Governor of Nova Scotia. John
came to Victoria at 16, and after a spell as
jackeroo opened branches of the London
Bank at several of the early gold rushes.
His two boys are Major W. M. Trew, who
came back from Anzac and France with the
D.S.O. a fortnight before his dad went west,
and Major 11. F. Trew, Commissioner of
Police at Pretoria.
Charles Johnston, Speaker of the Maori-
land Leg. Council, crossed the border last
week. He was 73, tall, white-headed and
florid-faced, and had been a rather casual
member of the Old Men’s Refuge since ’9l.
Otherwise there was nothing about Charles
Johnston to take notice of except that he was
very rich. The original Maoriland Johnston
was a London stockbroker who, after getting
“hammered,” migrated to the Windy Isles,
CHARLTON, M.H.R.
and, starting: in business at Wellington as a
merchant, prospered greatly. Three sons in-
herited the proceeds. Charles stuck to the
business in a decorative way, made more
money and incidentally married one of the
Featherstones. Brother Walter became a
squatter, held a portfolio in several Bight
Thinking Ministries of the long ago, and was
waiting for Charlie over yonder. The family
has been hard hit by the war, and the just-
dead man had a sorrowful year or two at
the finish. He was the last but one of the
Leg. Council “lifers.” The survivor of them
all is old Colonel Baillie, the sole surviving
white officer of the battle of Chillian wallah.
Colonel “Charlie” Butler, son of the State
Treasurer of S. Aus., has now got permis-
sion from the Defence Department to raise
a reinforcement of 500 men and take them
to the Front with him. He came home
with trench-fever.
Lieut. P. Y. Storkey, Australia’s newest
V.C., was dux of the Napier (M.L.) Boys’
School before he crossed to Sydney to take
his law course. He enlisted in 1915, his
final year, was severely wounded late in 1916,
and in 1917 his ankle was crushed —
but he was all there when liis chance
came for the V.C. F. N. Lipscomb,
an English-born lieutenant of the same
(19tli) Battalion, joined him in his
wild enterprise. Lipscomb used to be a
farmer, arid is 25 years long one way and
6ft. Ifin. the other. Storkey is 26 and five
feet seven and a half.
Brisbane Anglican Synod keeps its jubilee
this month. Only one member of the first
Synod is left —Canon “Tommy” Jones, who
has sat in every session for the 50 years.
But he doesn’t hold the Anglican long-
distance: record for Brisbane. Mrs. Hard-
grave. who was 90 the other day, has been
attending Brisbane Cathedral (or the
churches which preceded it) for 71 years.
“ J.F.11.” resurrects an Australian pioneer :
There are probably .still a few oldest inhabitants
who remember Archbishop Ullathorne, one of the
EVERYTHING COMPLETE.
“Cheero, Hill. You look as if you’re off to
Turkey! ”
most striking and picturesque personalities of early
Australia. His biography has been published by the
London Catholic Truth Society. He went to Aus-
tralia in 1832 at the age of 26, with jurisdiction as
Vicar-General over the whole continent. Governor
Bourke playfully dubbed him “Agitation-General of
Australia,” on account of his propensity for insisting
on getting grievances redressed. After declining-
three Australian bishoprics—Adelaide, Hobart and
Perth —-he accepted a couple of English sees. That
is an ecclesiastical record likely to stand until the
crack of doom. Perth, by the way, is described in
this book as being in N. S. Wales: hazy ideas of
Australian geography still prevail in old England.
Dr. Ullathorne saw a great deal of the convict sys-
tem, published a book on “The Horrors of Trans-
portation,” and gave evidence before a House of
Commons committee on the subject: Marcus Clarke
found some of his first-hand information useful when
writing “His Natural Life.” Returning to England
he became the first Bishop of Birmingham and was
a foremost figure in English Catholic life and
literary activity for the next 40 years. His last
book —he was guilty of over 30 —was a memoir of
his old friend, Dr. Willson, the first Bishop of
Hobart. 'Although he saw so much of convict life
in the Australia of the ’thirties and ’forties, it was
not until the ’fifties, when he was Bishop of Bir-
mingham, that he had his one and only experience
as a prisoner himself. Committed to Warwick
Castle for a week for some technical breach of
the law in connection with an estate of which he
was an ex officio trustee, lie took his imprisonment
with philosophical lightheartedness, and laughingly
remarked that it was the first period of real retire-
ment from the world he had ever enjoyed.
“The Oldest Inhabitant”: Concerning the
father of Vic.’s new K.C.M.G., Mitchell,
K.C. William Henry Fancourt Mitchell was
a son of Rev. George Barkley Mitchell, vicar
of St. Mary’s, Leicester, and chap-
lain to the Duke of York of very
pious memory. Arriving in Van
Iliemen’s Land, he for a time filled
the office of Colonial Secretary.
He crossed to Melbourne about
1840 and went squatting; but at
the time of the gold fever Latrobe
invited him to organise a police
force and become Chief Commis-
sioner. It was he who introduced
the cadet system by promising a
number of dashing young fellows
commissions and outfits on their
passing through a successful pro-
bation in hunting bushrangers and
doing gold-escort duty. In the
’fifties Captain McMahon, head of
the City Police, became Acting-
Commissioner and eventually took
over the job. Mitchell, sen.* entered political
life as one of the five original M’s.L.C. for
the N.W. province (1856).
Knox and Cox came back to Melbourne by
a recent transport. George Hodges Knox, of
the 23rd, went away as a lieutenant, and re-
turned by way of Gallipoli and France as a
lieut.-colonel. Like young Athol Teare, M.C.,
who travelled home by the same boat, he was
an orchardist in more peaceful days—an
occupation also followed by Major-General
Gellibrand, a Tasmanian leader of whom
more will shortly be heard. Major Cox
belonged to the 14tli —Jacka’s battalion —and
has been three times wounded. His brother
A.R. —same rank and battalion —has been
wounded four times. They were both in
Gallipoli.
“Philosopher” Smith did more than dis-
cover Mt. Bischoff’s tin; he gave his name-
sake, Laird Smith. M.11.R.. a
push along the track to the Fed.
Parliament. When Laird
Smith was a youth knocking
about the N.W. coast of the
Speck, the old battler encour-
aged him to read and acquire
that ability to quote Aristotle
and other long-dead birds which
convinced Hobart Laborites
that he was the very man to
go to the House of Reps, for
them.
An early predecessor of Post-
master-General Webster a t
Melbourne was an ex-lieu-
tenant of the 50th . Regi-
ment, Benjamin Baxter, who
was more at home in the newly-
established Club, on the race-
course or in private theatricals
than at sorting mails in the
small weatherboard cottage in
Flinders-street. So his wife did
all the work : and soon she fell
foul of the Sydney authorities.
Letters from Melbourne to
Europe were sent via Sydney,
which received the postage, then
heavy. Mrs. Baxter took ad-
vantage of the sailing of the
Thomas Laurie, the first wool-
ship from Port Phillip, to send
a mail direct to London; and
thus she struck the first strong
blow for decentralisation. But the subse-
quent storm nearly blew the roof off Cape
York. The Baxters soon after resigned,
and Skene Craig, a merchant, undertook to
manage the Melbourne office.
Harry Holland, lately elected to succeed
Paddy Webb for Grey in the M.L. Parlia-
ment, scraped through with only 210 votes
to the good. It was his first win of the
kind, but he well knows the bitterness of
defeat, having unsuccessfully contested
Senate elections and Federal and State seats
in N. S. Wales more times than he cares to
remember. Harry was born at Queanbeyan
(N.S.W.) in ’6B, and for nearly 30 yeai's
worked on Revolutionary Socialist and Labor
papers. He started on the Socialist, at
Sydney, in ’94, then went to the Northern
People at Newcastle, which later came to
Sydney, and is still going as the People.
Finally he gravitated to the Maoriland
Worker, and from that sanctum moves to
Parliament. A ready and forceful talker.
Henry Holland will insist on being noticed
by the Speaker.
W. Cameron, the stolid cocky who dished
Laborite Toombs for the Upper Hunter
(N.S.W.) Assembly seat, is a native of the
district, born about 40 years back at Rouchel,
where his family were amongst the earliest
settlers. He fought in S’Africa, and was one
of the party which escaped from the Boer
ambush at the Zand River. Later, he was
with the Australian contingent at King
George’s Coronation, and later still went to
Ceylon with E. F. Waddy’s cricket team.
George Hibbert, a soft-drinks maker of
Sorrento (Vic.), has a daughter who is
doing her bit in rubber top-boots. Before
the war her part in life was mostly orna-
mental ; but when the Hibbert boys began
to go off to the Front she put on one of
the lads’ outfits and started to do a man’s
work at the factory. There are now four
Hibbert soldiers in the field.
DIFFERENT VIEWS.
TJE DOG : “Awful bore that Smith. He's
just been telling me all about his
career .”
THE CAT: “Bore? I found him most inter-
esting—he’s just been telling me all
about his wife’s.”
From the Front: —
Lieut.-Colonel Lamb, brother-in-law of the late
“Jimmie Pannikin,” has returned for the second time
from the big fight. He left as captain in the 3rd Bat-
talion, received his majority in Egypt and took part
in the Landing, and was soon afterwards shot through
the arm and invalided to Australia. After a spell
of six months he again left, as lieutenant-colonel in
charge of the 34th. He saw active service in
France till bad weather and hard fare downed him.
In England he was in charge of Lark’s Hill camp,
and later was a president of court-martials; but
this sort of soldiering did not fit in with Lamb’s
notions, and he applied to be sent into the firing-liHe
again or to be ticketed for home. He arrived last
week labelled, as he hopes, T.U.G.S. (Temporarily
unfit for general service).
The Hector Observatory at Wellington
(M.L.) has sprung into world’s prominence
by being the first to record the new star’s
arrival on the astronomical chart. G. V.
Hudson, an unassuming but fearfully indus-
trious scientist, who, after pursuing beetles,
inspects the heavens every evening from the
near-by suburb of Karon, would appear to
have given the preliminary alarm, and the
glad tidings were promptly announced to the
world from the nearby observatory named
after the late James Hector, explorer and
geologist. The Hector Observatory is a
small but efficient establishment perched
among the gales on Kelburne Heights, the
local telescope and other implements having
been removed thither so that Richard Sedclou
might be buried on the site of the old obser-
vatory. The elderly King having given up
the' job of registering meridian and other
time, E. C. Adams succeeded him in charge,
and blossomed into being Dominion Astrono-
mer. Adams, a brother of Arthur, of Syd-
ney, is a brilliant mathematician, and not
long ago spent a happy year at the famous
Tuck Observatory, in America, measuring
comets’ tails and making other vast calcu-
lations.
Still living in Ballarat, aged 83, William
Roberts, the last survivor of the party of
miners who found the Welcome Nugget—6o
years ago on June 8. The speck was dis-
covered at a depth of 100 ft., and weighed
21950 z. With the idea of disposing of it by
art-union, the Wittkowski brothers bought it
for £lO,OOO, but this was before the days of
patriotic raffles, and their scheme w T as
blocked. Eventually the nugget was sold in
England. One of the finders, who had
bought a sliare in the claim for £l3O, died
a while ago in the Ballarat Benevolent
Asylum.
A LEAF FROM NATURE’S BOOK.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Stricken by the season’s wind,
Blushing an autumnal tint,
In your fall, O leaf, I find
Mother Nature’s gentle hint:
Spring and summer, autumn—then
Winter is the end of men.
Life of man is but a year.
Seasons four we sinners know;
Autumn tells of winter near
When it is our time to go,
Rotting like a fallen leaf
In this world of joy and grief.
Time is endless ; yet a span,
Measured by the hand of Fate,
Covers all the life of man—
Thus the solemn preachers prate.
Some men live till they be old,
Palsied by the winter’s cold.
Some, like leaves by summer storm
Torn from out the forest screen,
Perish whilst their hearts are warm ;
Others pluckt when newly green—•
Like the leaves that wilt or thrive, .
Some must die and some survive.
Youth and love, and manhood’s prime
Pass in turn from green to red:
Human leaves are changed by Time,
Lasting on till they be dead.
Memory has most to give
To the men who longest live.
But, in my late autumn days,
Thinking how I soon must drop,
I regard the sweet bouquets
Fashioned in the florist’s shop :
Autumn sprays with buds combined—
Leaves and roses intertwined.
I would be like one of these,
Spared the chilly winter’s breath,
Privileged to aid and please
Beauty whilst I sink to death....
Autumn leaf and faded youth—
Hackneyed thought, eternal truth!
VICTORIA.

Whatever the faults of its public finance
M.L. has at any rate made something of an
effort to collect a part of the war profits
which its people have made. Bates and taxes
paid by the B.N.Z. have moved as follows:
1914 .. £61,267 I 1917 .. £198,052
1915 .. 74,549 1918 .. 346,385
1916 . . 137,096 j
The declared profits are, nevertheless, greater
for the past year than for any period prior
to the war. Yet not very much greater. If
something substantial has not been put to
internal reserves, The Bulletin would be
inclined to say that the excess profit
at present is not sufficient in view
of the increased risks. The outlook
has no doubt been vastly improved by
the purchase, announced during the past
week, of the Australian wool clip for two
years certain at a minimum of 15d. per lb.,
apparently f.o.b. Whether the M.L. clip will
be taken is not yet clear; but in any case
the minimum market value for at least two
years ahead is fixed. And the fixing of the
wool clip at so high a level automatically
ensures a high price for mutton and lamb car-
cases ; and these are the lines that mostly
concern Maoriland. Further, prices for but-
ter and most other foodstuffs will be affected
by the prices. for meat. Timber also will
certainly continue in keen demand. These
things, while helping to maintain the cur-
rent profits of the B.N.Z. and other financiers
and dealers in exchange, will also stabilise
land values, and that will lessen the risks of
heavy and numerous capital losses.
After previous wars one thing has been
noted: the rapidity with which agricultural
countries recovered. This time it will pro-
bably be noted that they will suffer least
from reaction. It will be the manufacturing
countries which will be thrown into greatest
confusion through the sudden diversion of
the world’s plants to peaceful production and
the stoppage of munition-manufacture at
almost any price that those interested chose
to ask. The market values of a thousand
things will fall rapidly ; and in that fall there
is the genesis of serious financial trouble. We
shall not escape some of that. It is the
easiest thing in the world to sell at a profit
on a rising market: it isn’t at all easy to
avoid losses on a falling market. This is
the one thing that can be said in justification
of what is known as profiteering. The trader
who has made profits during the past two
or three years and hasn’t laid some of those
profits by for contingencies is taking risks.
And, though for the reasons given above the
outlook is vastly improved for Australia and
to an even greater extent perhaps for Maori-
land, banks which haven’t put something up
their sleeve to provide for possible commer-
cial failures are likely to be sorry before the
world settles do\Vn again.
How easy it has been for the B.N.Z. to
make increased profits—on paper, at any rate
—this next comparison shows :

Since March, 1914, deposits have increased
by no less than just upon 70 p.c.—a simply
amazing growth, attributable, of course,
partly to the very high cash prices which
Britain has been paying for practically
everything that M.L. produces, and partly
and still more largely to the issue of paper
in the shape of notes and national lOU’s.
Maoriland has no Dominion State Bank;
but the Government holds the £750,000 of
pref. capital in the B.N.Z. and guarantees
the £529,959 of 4 p.e. stock. This is a
relic of less happy days when, at the end of
a wild borrowing boom, the pistol was held
at the head of the Government and it was
ordered to fork out or take the consequences.
It forked out, and the consequences have
been very pleasant. On its £500,000 of
“A’’ pref. capital it gets 10 p.c.; on its £250,000
of “B” pref. capital it collects 15 p.c. ; and a
shareholder who wants more than 15 p.c. on
pref. capital secured by £1,000,000 of
ordinary capital and nearly 2-J millions of
reserves, is hard to satisfy. A further re-
sult of the bank’s connection with the Gov-
ernment is a very big exchange business.
Because of the large payments made in Eng-
land and the comparative absence of shipping
and imports, money at call and short notice,
Government securities and other securities
in London now amount to no less than
£12,153,745, with another £259,136 in tran-
sit. In 1914 the assets in London (apart
from bills) were £5,076,749. Including the
London holdings and public securities held
in M.L., the liquid assets are over 62 p.c.
of the total liabilities —an indication that the
bank is holding itself well in hand. While
the deposits, as before shown, have increased
by £12,367,000, advances are only £6,426,000
greater. Liquid assets are up £10,036,000.
Granted, then, that the increase in the
figures is largely due to conditions which
are not stable, it can at least be said

This is the half-year of probably the most
successful concern of its class in Sydney—
or, for that matter, Australia. True, in
years gone by other land and building cos.
have shown big profits on paper; but they
didn’t wash up well. This seems to be the
other sort of co. For instance, its assets
are valued at £323,019, and of that lot only
£43,207 is freehold property; and as that
includes fine city office premises, the book
value of estates and unsold remnants of
estates must be infinitesimal. Further, the
co.’s total liabilities, including provision for
taxation, are only £30,391; so that it can’t
be embarrassed by depositors and other
creditors dropping in for their money and
compelling the directors to sacrifice assets.
The co. could, in fact, pay off all its deposi-
tors with the proceeds of its Commonwealth
Loan investment. No doubt it carries risks:
“Borrowers’ and purchasers’ balances”
total £253,385. Six months ago the direc-
tors said as to this item : “Of the total sum
over 80 p.c. is secured on rent-producing
properties, the remainder representing bal-
ances on sales of land. Ample provision has
been made for possible losses.” The co.
looks, therefore, nice and snug. What sort
of a future it will have will depend mainly
upon the assistance the Commonwealth gives
new and old industries. With Protection
and a saner view as to the amount of work
a man ought to do, the co. should still be kept
busy, while avoiding any capital losses
worth mentioning. Its reserves, notwith-
standing frequent transfers to capital, are
so solid that 5 p.c. earned by its own funds
is equal to 9 p.c. on its capital.

Sydney liad a little boom in company flota-
tions in 1910, and this was one of the con-
cerns of that period. W. E. Smith, who had
built up the business, played a lone hand;
and when he went the organisation was not
there to carry on. Yet in a case of this
kind goodwill is mostly organisation; so
that the greater part of what was paid for
goodwill was paid for a myth. Also, stock
had been badly taken. Presently other
hands got hold of the business; and it was
decided to cut out the dead wood. The capi-
tal had been £75,000 in £1 shares. This was
written down to £45,000 by wiping out Bs.
per share; and then a fresh start was made.
Stocks have been hard to get; on the other
hand, trade generally has been so brisk in
Sydney, owing to artificial stimulation, that
in this and other lines it hasn’t been difficult
to pass on the extra costs. Hence the
steady improvement in profits. And, as the
next table shows, in the financial position
also:—

Cash and sundries 8,214 7,694 9,696
Meantime a dividend averaging about 5 p.c.
on the written-down capital has been paid.
It is nothing to feel gay about. Certainly
the latter half of the period has been much
better than the former half; but, taking all
the circumstances into account, the figures
don’t hold out much promise of anything
extra-good under the sub-normal and normal
conditions to be faced presently. The co.
is in a business where there is very keen
competition, largely from concerns with
small overhead charges; and its premises,
though extensive, are not well placed to
catch the trade in small stationery lines in
which there has been large profit of late.

This co. and W. E. Smith’s are in the same
category; and there are others of about the
same age which have had the same life his-
tory. Actually there isn’t a trace of the
old A.B.C. business left: the two shops it
had (on short leases) in Pitt-street are
closed—one was found almost at once to be
unprofitable. The directors , (the co. is in
the. Arthur Rickard stable) lately, therefore,
decided to lop off the dead wood here, too,
and during the half-year goodwill was writ-
ten off (£9384) and plant written down
(£1116). That meant writing off £10,500
of capital, the £35,000 shares being reduced
from 20s. to 14s. Yet it is probable that
the goodwill is really worth to-day more
than it was when the co. was formed; for
the sign of “Miss Bishop’s Cakes” may be
just as much a draw as “the A.8.C.” "was
—of late years, at any rate. The “Miss
Bishop” shops now number 14, half of them
opened during the past 18 months. In these
days of very dear provisions it looks as
though there should be more profit, because
less waste, in these light-refreshment shops
than in heavy-lunch rooms. Supervision is
also simpler; and where there is food to
handle supervision may easily make all the
difference between loss and profit. The out-
look for the co. is therefore brighter than it
was ; though close management will still, of
course, be required. The co. is handicapped
with a factory which stands in the books at
£17,000, and cost more; and to finance that
it had to take a mortgage and issue deben-
tures. However, since September, 1915, the
liability on these accounts has been reduced
from £IO,OOO to £SOOO, including £IOOO paid
off since March 31. There are also sundry
creditors for £7330. Presently—after the
debenture debt has been wiped out —the co.
looks as though it will be able to buy to
better advantage. But that will mean, of
couse, keeping a tight rein on dividends and
accumulating cash to pay for stocks.

From a Maoriland policy-holder
From your review of the report of the A.M.P.
it is quite evident that policy-holders having
“non-profit” policies with the Society are in a much
better position than “with-profit” policy-holders,
owing to their policies not being affected by increased
taxes, unfavorable death experience and the tendency
to increased expense ratio. One would think it neces-
sary to revise the without-profit rate in order to even
things up a bit. I have no data by me to go on,
but a comparison would be instructive.
It is true that profits or bonuses are for the
moment severely cut; and if present condi-
tions continued it certainly would be more
advantageous to take non-profit policies.
But present conditions will not continue.
As this page has pointed out frequently,
higher interest earnings will rule for years
after the bonuses have ceased to be prejudi-
cially affected by the war; and a large pro-
portion of the earnings will be tax-free.
This point has so impressed some English
offices that one or two have actually
reduced the non-profit rates since the war
started, to bring them more in harmony
with the net with-profit rates.
On the whole question of participating
v. non-participating policies general-manager
Apperly, of the A.M.P., makes these observa-
tions :
If the life assured dies soon after the policy has
been taken out the non-participating policy shows
the better result; but if the life assured lives manv
years the participating policy is the better. No
exact line of demarcation can be laid down; but
take "an example. At age 32 the participating pre-
mium is about 25 per cent, more than the non-
participating. ltoughly speaking, if the accumulated
bonuses are more than 25 per cent, of the sum
assured the participating policy is the better.
In pre-war times the bonuses would have reached 25
per cent, of the sum assured in about 10 years, and
as the great majority of men who reach age 32
live more than 10 years afterwards, the participating
policy was generally the better. At present, rates
of bonus are depressed by war claims more than they
are raised by increased interest, and if the war lasts
•indefinitely it is quite possible that the non-partici-
pating policy will prove the better contract. If, on
the other hand, the war terminates, and rates of
interest keep up, the bonuses will tend to rise
rapidly and the participating policy will be the
better.
The Society has no means of knowing how long the
war is likely to last, or what the future rate of
interest is going to be; but it is keeping a careful
watch on the position and, as it has done in the past,
will readjust its rates of premium on new policies
(those on existing policies cannot be increased) if
such appears necessary or advisable.
In Britain the general, trend of premiums
for non-participating insurance has been
downward during the past 10 years; but
the A.M.P.’s rate is still lower than that of
most British offices, though there has been,
apparently, no change in the A.M.P.’s pre-
miums during the period. Take this com-
parison of premiums per £IOO of insurance
on whole-life non-participating policies:—
Age at entry.... 30 40 50
A.M.P £1 17 9 £2 12 2 £3 17 2
Alliance .. .. 118 10 213 5 318 2
Com. Tnion.. . . 118 6 212 5 315 10
Equitable .. .. 115 9, 2 9 2 311 4
Prudential . . . . 117 7 212 2 316 4
Scottish Widows .. 11911 214 8 319 8
There are offices, such as the Clergy Mutual,
which cater for special classes; and their
rates are exceptionally low (the Clergy
Mutual, for instance, issues a £IOO policy at
30 for £1 15s. Bd.) ; but these don’t fall
properly within this general comparison. Nor
perhaps does the old Equitable, which has
special features, such as non-canvassing for
new business as other offices know it.

F. G. Murdoch, secretary of the Wallaroo
and Moonta Cos., has communicated a
scheme for remodelling Federal and State
income taxes. He concludes, of course, that
the two ought to be collected bv the Fed-
eral authority. But though the Federal form
is based on equity, the overhead charges are
heavy and “it is open to doubt whether the
small taxpayer would not be just as well
off under a less complicated system.” He
suggests:—•
(1) Adoption of a simple graduation scale of tax.
(2) Taxation of dividends of companies at the
source.
On the latter point he says:—
This represents one of the chief differences between
the Federal and State representatives. The Federal
authorities do not agree with taxation at the source
because they think that thereby the small shareholder
pays more heavily in proportion to his income than
the large holder. This is undoubtedly correct; but,
at the same time, the work and expense required by
both the individual taxpayer and the Government to
attain this acme of perfection in taxation are so
great that it is urgent that some compromise should
be arrived at.
A company s profits may be said, roughly, to be
used in three ways:—
(a) Payment of preference and/or debenture com-
mitments.
(b) Payment of dividends.
(c) Establishment of reserves for use in the busi-
ness.
As regards (a), the payments are always of a fixed
nature. It is evident that a co., having issued deben-
tures or preference shares on the basis that certain
taxation be paid by the shareholders, should not be
saddled with this taxation while being forced to
continue to pay the same rate of interest. Conse-
quently it is only equitable that a co. should be taxed
separately on this item and be allowed to deduct an
estimated amount from the interest paid to cover any
extra tax involved.
In connection with ( b ) the suggestion is that this
be treated as an entirely separate item of profit, and

that the dividends be taxed at the source on a gradu-
ally rising scale.
The dividend would be taxed as under, the per-
centage and capital figures being given merely as an
illustration: —
Ist 4 p.c. of capital ( £100,000)= £SOO exempt.
2nd" „ „ ~ = £SOO tax 3d. in £
3rd „ „ ~ £SOO tax 6d. in £
4th ~ ~ ~ = £SOO tax 9d. in £
And so on. On a gradually rising scale of 3d. per
-1 p.c., the tax on the last £SOO of a 10 p.c. dividend
would be ss. in the £, while the amount of the divi-
dend over 10 p.c. could be taxed either at a flat
rate or on a continued ascending scale.
The result would be that cos. could provide, out
of the amount available for each dividend, the tax
required under the Act; there would be no necessity
for the cos. to send in returns of shareholders’ divi-
dends ; the tax would be paid to the authorities in
one amount; the shareholders would benefit by the
graduation of the tax, in which the smaller share-
holders would participate.
Wallaroo and Moonta’s contribution is a
welcome attempt to get over a large diffi-
culty. In theory, the Commonwealth sys-
tem is full of merit. But no system so
obscure that the taxpayer cannot understand
and check his assessments will ever be satis-
factory. Nine-tenths or more of the Com-
monwealth’s taxpayers, it is safe to say,
“take it blind.” A few make an effort to
check the figures. Very few succeed. No
system of taxation of which this can be said
will give satisfaction. More than that, it is
very doubtful whether any system is defen-
sible which does not permit of a complete
check by a person of, at most, average
ability. The present system, then, despite
its theoretical merits, is in practice a failure.
The business of “curves” is, however, not
one of principle, and could be got over
easily enough. The question of taxation
“at its source” or otherwise is very differ-
ent. The Wallaroo suggests as a compro-
mise a simply-graduated tax on the ordinary
dividend, making this payable by the co.
The Bulletin sees grave objections to that.
It would penalise those cos. which have
laid aside large reserves. The co. of that
kind which is paying 10 p.c. may be far
better entitled to consideration than another
which has either capitalised its reserves,
issued a huge proportion of its shares for
goodwill, or paid out every cent it could lay
its hands on and therefore now pays a divi-
dend of only 7 p.c. Before such a method
of graduation could be equitable cos. would
have to be given the right to capitalise their
reserves —which, of course, would mean re-
valuing their assets; for the best reserves
are often not shown in the books.

“Ex-Banker” : Fusion of banks here is not
the same thing as the establishment of a
banking monopoly in London by the union of
joint stock banks. Here the Commonwealth
Bank represents the nation, and can prevent
evils likely to accrue from monopoly. There are
too many banks in Australia, and consequently
too many branches. As an illustration, Ben-
digo has 10 branch banks, or five too many.
Five offices could easily and better do the
banking business of 25,100 people. If there
were only nve branches the employees would
be better paid, the expenses considerably less,
and the net profits larger. The amalgama-
tion of the National and Colonial will close
one office there, and the furniture, books,
notes, gold-scales and old coats will be
handed over the fence to the surviving office
within 60 minutes, and the public will be no
worse off, while the manager who is left
behind 'will get a rise in his screw,
and even the “pig-boy” who carries
round the exchange books will get,
or ought to get, another 10 bob a week. The
next amalgamation ought to be that of the
Victoria and Royal. The former Bank of
Victoria, existent before the deluge of 1893,
had to fight in 1852 to get its charter from
Parliament against the opposition of the Bank
of Australasia and the Union, two London
institutions, and the Bank of N. S. Wales.
These rivals succeeded in prohibiting the
Bank of Victoria opening in the other
“colonies” and prevented the bank ever
becoming- a serious opponent. Now if the
Royal Bank buys out the Victoria, the new
concern can open where it pleases and also
shut where it likes. The main figures of a
Royal-Victoria Bank would be, roughly,
deposits, £10,000,000; advances, £9,000,000;
capital, £2,000,000; and reserve funds,
£550.000. There you have a pretty
strong bank. The new bank would benefit
by a strengthened executive and administra-
tive organisation. Of that there can be no
doubt. The Victoria needs fresh blood
higher up and the Royal can supply it. The
mingling of the two Boards of Directors and
of the two staff's of managers w r ould be a
great benefit to the older bank, which has a
good name and a fine connection of cus-
tomers in its home State.

The S. Aus. Gas Cos. has had a sort of
Ministerial crisis. It called the shareholders
together to authorise the issue of 6 p.c. bonds
to the value of £50,000, and when that was
done they claimed a prior right to subscribe,
on the strength of the circular issued to
them, which said that forms of application
would be available immediately after the
resolution was earned. The bonds, how-
ever, had all been subscribed in advance, and
the directors claimed that in these difficult
times the only safe course had been to get
them underwritten. The meeting got
angry, but when the Board played the
Parliamentary game, and treated the oppos-
ing motion as a direct want-of-confidence
affair, shareholders said they didn’t mean to
go as far as that, and watered down the
resolution to read that they should have
first chance “in future” and “as far as possi-
ble.” But there is a vast difference between
underwriting a loan, which is merely an in-
surance against failure, and receiving “hun-
dreds of applications,” as in this case, while
most persons interested were led to believe
that they could do nothing till the meeting
had been held. At its best it was a clumsy
piece of management, followed by a clumsier
attempt to excuse it.
Broken Hill South is reconstructing,
partly to put all shares on the same footing,
partly to make the stock handier for market-
ing : it has been quoted at over £ll lately.
The co. is in 200,000 shares, 130,90 S fully
paid, the other 09.092 paid to 9s. Od. ; and
the fully paids will probably have 10s. Od.
refunded to make all alike. The present in-
tention is to cut the shares into quarters.
The 73rd dividend will be paid on June 28;
it will be the usual quarterly os., and will
bring the total distributed to £2,355,000, or
£ll 15s. Od. per share; and there is a liquid
surplus of well over £3 in hand. That monu-
ment to T. J. Greenway hasn’t been erected
yet. You could have bought the South and
the North for a few thousands after it had
been proved that those mines contained
hardly anything but sulphide ores of low
silver value. It was Greenway who tackled
the concentration of this ore. The B. H.
Prop, was much too affluent in those days to
worry much about such “refuse” —the refuse
that the whole of the present South co.’s
dividends have come out of.

“Quidnunc”: Victorian Premier Lawson
is to unburden himself at Castlemaine next
week on the brown coal question. There is
every indication that Cabinet intends him to
administer soothing-syrup to both the Kiewa
River and the brown coal enthusiasts. So
Lawson may tell Private Enterprise to go
ahead with the Kiewa scheme, at the same time
saying something to the effect that the State
recognises the value of brown coal, and that
it intends to take into very serious consid-
eration the Morwell deposits with a view to
their economic development, etc., etc. On
the other hand Lawson may be big enough
to see that phrases like that won’t meet
Victorian industrial needs. Electrical steel
enterprises and woollen mills are praying
for cheap power. Most people don’t know
that with a little fixing of grates, not only
in factories but in the domestic stove, brown
coal burns splendidly and has a good calo-
rific value. With black coal at 41s. a ton
to the householder Minister Barnes ought to
have demonstrators round Melbourne show-
ing housewives how to burn the brown stuff.
When he gets time he might consider
the question whether, as a mining mana-
ger, he would tolerate in his own mine
costs like those being recorded at Morwell.
Finally, he might call on the Railway
Commissioners to explain how it is that
in the United States it costs only 10s.
per ton to carry a load of coal 1000
miles, while in Victoria it costs 4s. 6d. to
lift the Morwell product 80 miles. Both
Minister Barnes and Premier Lawson have
the industrial fate of Victoria in their hands
if they are bold enough to grapple the pro-
blem of cheap power. If they don’t care to
undertake the big job themselves they might
delegate the duty to a working trust.

. Bendigo Amalgamated has not a monopoly
of the bad luck of the field, for, with its
yields included, the whole district produced
only 23,4270 z. for the past five months. This
compares with 48,0820 z. for the same period
in 1916 and 65,7710 z. in 1913. Unless some-
thing is done on the side-lines, or Teddy
Dyason’s luck changes, there isn’t much hope
of an improvement either, because the scrap-
ping of plants at so many mines means an
end to tributing or prospecting from them
on to the minor saddles.
* * * *
After having a look over the Glengarry,
outside Bendigo, director John Northe.v
flashed this brief, enthusiastic message over
the wires: “Good, quite all right.” At the
surface the Glengarry didn’t count for much.
Bhoots were short and the reef small and
ill-defined, so that the formation looked to be
squibby. Prospector Grant, who helped
Herbert Daly’s Jubilee to see the light,
declares he has better promise at the
Glengarry than he got at the surface at that
venerable old dividend-payer. If correct, John
and Paul Northey have picked a cheap min-
ing line. As for bottom-level developments,
the few feet of driving done on the 2Ut. of
stone exposed doesn’t disprove that surface
work was wrong any more than it proves the
accuracy of the “quite all right” tip.
h A% En - g lsh " owl ? ed MidJ and Railway Cos.

lhus in a single year the whole improve-
ment of the preceding seven years was more
than swept away; and, although the war
and unfavorable harvests accounted for a bit
°- the subsequent slump, most of the
decrease was due to the Government line
which the co. vehemently declares was built
in “brutal disregard of all that is fair and
just.” In an appeal to the State Govern-
ment the co. asked to be exempted from pay-
ment of land tax on the 1,768,662 acres of
unsold land which for the time being it says
it can neither sell nor make revenue produc-
ing. To this appeal Ministers have turned
their deaf ear.

Perth’s recently-formed Mining Associa-
tion has started to do things. Headed by
president A. E. Morgans, it has set out to
secure the amendment of mining and taxa-
tion laws so that capital will be attracted.
A proposal to make a canvass for funds is
now under consideration. Meantime an
elaborate pamphlet has been issued setting
forth the golden records of the past and the
immense possibilities of the future. There
are 3110 abandoned gold-mines in the West,
and the Association urges that some of these
shows should be given another trial. Atten-
tion is also directed to the possibilities of
Westralian base-metals, which have not as
yet been seriously developed, though produc-
tion to date exceeds 5f- millions in value.

The Golden Butterfly has abandoned its
Blue Streak option at Tuckabianna (W.A.).
The co. wanted a year’s free extension;
but the vendors asked £7OO cash, a
further £2300 at the end of the year, and
also stipulated that the shaft should be sunk
to 200 ft. The Butterfly directors did not
take long to decide that the cash-box couldn’t
stand the strain.

. American oil men are beginning to talk in
billions about the oil-shale industry of
Colorado, Utah and Nevada. The growing
shortage of well oil has galvanised the oil
people into activity in locating shale deposits
and in testing them with new processes.
Some of the results are remarkable, as high
as 100 gallons of oil per ton of shale having
been distilled at the testing laboratories of
the U.S. Geological Survey. What is possi-
ble in Utah ought to be feasible in N. S.
Wales. About eight new methods of extract-
ing the oil, tar and sulphate of ammonia are
being tried officially, though none of the new
inventions seems to have been used except in
laboratory work. The Americans appear to
envy the success of the Scottish shale-mines,
which from reefs two to six feet wide at
depths of 1800 ft. pay from 10 to 60 p.c
dividends. During 1916, the Scotch shale
cos. treated 3,500,000 tons, from which thev
produced 80,500,000 gallons of crude oil -
of marketable products (in gallons) : motor
S M iri o’o 9,9.9’9,9,2 ’ naphtha, 4,480,000 ; burning
oil, 22 000,000; gas or fuel oil, 13,100,000 •
and lubricating oils, 11,000,000. There
were also. the paraffin wax and sulphate
of ammonia. The industry is a fine field
a j ® new . Board of Trade to tackle.
And it isn’t likely to neglect the opportunity,
lhe vice-president, who no doubt will have
to do most of the bullocking, allows him-
seft to be an enthusiast on this question of
seeking for a of oil in Australia.
Mount Cuthbert (Q.) did better in May
and produced 222 tons of blister copper, com-
pand with 149 tons in April and 195 tons
m March. The smelter is capable of 10
tons of blister per day. Last month 2984
tons ore were treated ;so about 13* tons of
ore were required to produce a ton of blister,
lhe Hampden average is about 12* tons.

A BEAUTIFUL COMPLEXION WITH-
OUT ROUGE OR POWDER.
Many women—both young and old —suffer
greatly from sallow complexions. Some-
times this is the result of climatical condi-
tions, sometimes the cause is constitutional;
hut whatever it be, it is decidedly unnatural
and unpleasant. Bathing in milk occasion-
ally is said to be most helpful and soothing
to the skin, hut just try the following recipe,
which any chemist will make up for you :
Two oz. of rosewater, two oz. flowers of
oxzoin and one djtam tincture of benzoin.
Apply this night and morning with a sponge
after washing, and* let it dry on, then dust
the skin lightly with a soft cloth. This home-
made lotion is one of the best and supersedes
rouge or powder, leaving the skin beautifully
soft, clear and smooth. — Advt.

A WOMAN’S
LETTER
Sydney, June 17, 1918.
My Dear Arini, —
Lieutenant-Governor J. 11. P. Murray, of
Papua, and his secretary, Leonard Murray,
enjoyed a few days this week in Sydney,
en route to Melbourne. His Ex. is an adver-
tisement of how to live in the tropics and
thrive on the climate. Papua has its hill-
tops, and the tall man (he’s well over 6ft.
high) talks cheerfully of a recent trip to
a peak 9000 ft. above sea level. His son
Pat was with him on the trip. The
youngest son, 18 years of age, left Riverview
College not long ago, and has father’s con-
sent to get into khaki. His big brother was
with an English regiment in 1914, was
wounded twice in France, won the Military
Cross and is stjll exchanging lead with
Fritz. Palestine is his latest address.
Stallholders anxious to supplement their
blue blossom supply raided city florists on
Violet Day, to the well-bred surprise of her
ladyship behind the counter. “Oh, dear, no.
Everything you see, Madam, is ordered.”
Entreaties to Melbourne to send supplies
were invariably answered, “None to be had.”
S O.S. signals were flashed to Moss Vale,
but the baskets of blooms that could be col-
lected from there were emptied in a couple
of hours when the man on the street com-
menced to unload his sixpences. “You can
smell them, if you like,” said one purple-
lmtted girl, “for a consideration; but if
you want to buy the bunch it’ll cost much
more than that.” The Soldiers’ Club girls,
with £4O worth of orders for the blooms, had
to carry on with daphne and sweet-pea.
The hon. treasurer expects that over
£BOOO will be the windfall. Last time the
violet bloomed for the Soldiers’ Club about
£l7OO was gathered in. That was considered
a big thing then, but the Club’s obligations
have grown. Good management holds this
city home for A.I.F. men on a sound basis,
and, keep this to yourself, the Club has no
debts.
The Millions Club, frivolously nicknamed
the “Munch Club” from its inveterate habit
of passing the oyster-patties, fed the depart-
ing French Consul Chayet the other day. Bel-
gium, U.S.A., Italy and Japan were officially
represented at the feast to the indefatigable
Frenchman, who has rarely been absent
from any patriotic or national gathering
since fateful August, 1914. He admits to a
tired feeling. The comparative seclusion of
South America, where the chief excitement
is a revolution before breakfast, will be a
restful interlude. He may even get an occa-
sional evening to himself when he settles
down in Guatemala. Anyway he carries away
the lasting good wishes of Sydney.
By the closing of Australia Day Fund,
the balance, £117,000, goes to the N. S. Wales
branch of the Red Cross. When in 1915
the public emptied its pockets of just over
£BOO,OOO to help our sick and wounded sol-
diers,. even to ourselves our generosity was a
surprise. Since then the fund has earned
about £32,000 interest, in spite of its grad-
ual disbursement. (Quite a lot of people
considered the disbursement to have been too
gradual.) Russell French took the chair at
the wind-up.
After long misery as a prisoner of war
in Germany, Lieut. Riley, a son of the Arch -
bishop of Perth, who sometimes visits us,
is in Holland. When the first guns boomed
lie was a Rhodes scholar at Oxford, and at
once joined up with the British “Contempt-
ibles.” The young man is now doing work
for the British News, a paper recently
born in Amsterdam.
The learned Macmillan Brown, of Maori-
land. is a visitor. He unpacked his kit last
week.
Archdeacon Gunther, good Australian,
who christened, bound in wedlock and buried
half the Anglicans in Parramatta district for
over 80 years, died a few days ago, aged
80. In recent years he was a dignified
figure at semi-ecclesiastic functions in
Sydney. lie was one of the kindest of men
and the easy prey of the burr which fastens
on to the coat of a soft-hearted cleric. He
was the son of Archdeacon Gunther, of the
Mudgee district.
Sister Eileen King, an Australian who
was severely wounded in France a few
months ago, is a daughter of a former
Deputy-Commissioner of Railways in
Queensland. The last mail brought word
that she’s out of hospital and regaining her
strength.
John Lemmone’s cheerful smile greeted
Melba when she arrived on Sunday.
Since she left here nine months ago
she has had a strenuous time, for,
besides heavy operatic and concert work,
she has been busy for the Red Cross
and other patriotic shows. She announces
that she is full of schemes which she will
put into operation with all possible speed
for the good of Billjim. On the boat
she organised a concert and an auction-sale
which raked in £4OO for the Red Cross. Alex.
Sass, who also returned to Australia, pre-
sented the songbird with a souvenir pro-
gramme gaily painted, which she sold for
many pounds, along with some new pictures
of her in operatic roles.
The prima donna rushed off to Melbourne
before Sydney had more than a glimpse of
her. She is back in Australia sooner than
was expected. Of her triumphal tour in
U.S.A. and of a chapter of accidents, includ-
ing the explosion of a German bomb in a
Chicago theatre which failed to do much
damage, she has engaging recollections. New
York hadn’t heard her in opera for years.
For her first-night performance in the Lex-
ington Theatre, “Faust,” the crowd began to
gather outside early in the afternoon. It was
a bitter winter day, and those in the long
queue clung to their bit of kerb throughout
a snowstorm. The tenor was the brilliant
Muratore, the French opera star.
Boston’s famous Symphony orchestra con-
ductor, Mueke, an elegant Hun, has been
interned, and the noted English musician, Sir
Henry Wood, engaged in his place. In Bos-
ton, by the way, the Australian skylark
sang at a concert to help the Halifax Dis-
aster Fund. At Santa Barbara (Cal.) the
Lilydale lady rented a mansion and kept it
filled with guests. In the house-party was
Lady Colebrook, a godchild of the late King
Edward and Queen Alexandra. She was
a famous beauty and notable as one of the
first Englishwomen to make munitions under
exactly the same conditions as a mechanic.
To contradict unreliable rumor the War
Chest shop-workers in George-street state
that they carefully avoid underselling the
trade or cutting into the price list of any
business. “In fact, the cost of the ingredi-
ents which we use in our cakes,” says Mrs.
A. Morris, in charge of the venture, “would
alone prohibit our undermining the ordinary
prices. We must make a margin of profit,
and even the donations in kind wouldn’t
warrant us ‘almost giving things away.’ ”
Every shilling made, barring for the rent,
goes to provide soldiers’ comforts.
The American-Australian League of Help
(Mrs. Brittain, president) has packed up
its gear and flitted into a new depot, 10-Car-
rington-street, not very far from its old
haunt in Wynyard-street. Sweets and home-
made candy, will be the League’s specialties
on Italy’s Day. June 28.
In the grand opera
treat being prepared
b y Mr s. Ferrari
Passmore, the San-
tuzza in “Cavalleria
Rusticana” will be
Emma Franceschi, a
daughter of Dr. Fran-
ceschi, of Lismore.
The young singer, a
soprano, was trained
in Italy by the
famous Vann i n i
(Cappelli’s teacher,
by the way). Dur-
ing the Gonsalez
opera season Emma
Franceschi appeared
as Santuzza once
only; and won for
herself a storm of
applause. She has dramatic fire, Mrs.
Ferrari Passmore’s night of opera, at the
Royal on June 21, is for the fund of Italy’s
Day. The photo of Emma is Judith
Fletcher’s work. The second act of Tosca
is also on the programme.
The C. of E. Boys’ Grammar had their
garden .fete officially “kicked off,” as one
young rip put it, by Mrs. Wright, wife of the
Archgaiters. The boys with the blue and
white hatbands are raising funds for a
Memorial Sports Ground. The sward is
near Nortlibridge, and will be a lasting and
fitting memorial to old boys who have fallen
in the defence of all that is good in man. Ex-
banker Tom Dibbs, who delights in these car-
nivals of youth, and the Badham triplet—the
venerable mother and two daughters—were
in the crush. It was a crush. An extra
hairpin would have stopped the traffic.
A big crowd poured into the Town Hall on
Saturday to see the film production of Am-
bassador Gerard’s book. “Four Years in
Germany.” In the official seats were Consul-
General and Mrs. Brittain, who left Hunland
in June, 1914. She recognised the accuracy
both of the portraits and the country in
which the most dramatic scenes were cast.
Consul Watteauw was also in the audience,
a silent watcher of some of the agony ot
Belgium. Mayor Joynton Smith spoke an
introductory piece. Consul Shimizu and his
dainty little missus, Consul Chayet, Deputy
Town Clerk W. G. Layton and a pretty
daughter, and Lieut.-Governor Murray ot
Papua (half a head above the average citi-
zen) and son Pat were also visible.
Isabel Ramsay, of the Inky Way, who
leaves shortly for ’Frisco, to attend a news-
paper folks’ conference, is going through a
course of Pekoe farewells. She hopes to
have a peep at England before returning to
Australia.
Peter Dawson has packed up his songs,
and will presently kiss his Annette (the
buxom lady who is Mrs. Peter) good-bye.
And then for the wars! He had a rousing
reception at his concerts during the week in
the Town Hall.
This is a recent
photo of artist
Charles Bryant,
lately added to the
list of “official”
painters who hope to
reproduce scenes in
which the glory of
France will live on
canvas. The Sydney
man has been away
for many years. Ten
of them were spent
in hard study with
John I-lassall and
the famous marine-
painter Olssen.
Bryant’s work is
familiar in the
London Royal x\cad-
emy and the Paris
Salon. The artist was rejected for active
service in the earlier days of the war.
Col. J. L. Shellshear, one of the most
enthusiastic artillery-officers Australia has
sent oversea, is now in charge of an English
hospital while someone else handles his be-
loved guns. There is a serious shortage of
medical men on the other side, and as Shell-
shear happened to be a doctor when at home
in Albury, he had to reluctantly leave his
roaring 18-pounders and take up the stetho-
scope again.
Winifred Burston's pianoforte recital at
the Conservatorium this week was a triumph
for the Australian girl. She played bril-
liantly, from Brahms (on a Handel theme),
without the score. The Liszt Sonata in B
minor and a Chopin finale was also played
from memory. A profusion of flowers was
handed up to the musician.
Among June birthday presents, counting
the King’s Birthday gifts in, the best came
to a woman in North Sydney. She is Mrs.
Donaldson, wife of the captain of the
Matunga—the B.P. boat that the Wolf
seized on the New Guinea coast and subse-
quently sank. After months and months of
silence and suspense word came that the
ship hadn’t foundered with all hands; then,
after some more months, a cable from him
that he was a prisoner in Germany. And
now. on his birthday, Mrs. Donaldson has
had a postcard, the first word from his own
hands, dated March 24. He was at Heidel-
berg then, in “a large, good camp.” “There
are three tennis courts,” he says, “and I
have just joined the club for the summer.”
“Jim” Allison, widower, is once more in-
stalled at the Union Club. He came back
to Sydney this week after pleading in vain
with Uncle Sam for a passport to cross the
Atlantic. He had a good reason for wanting
to get across. His young son has just got
back to Holland after three years in the
hands of the Hun. but this did not move
the stony-hearted Yanks ; so dad came home
to wait. •
The Beith family are home again after
thrilling times in England and New York.
The decorative eldest daughter is doing
V.A.D. work in London.
About 150 Roman “soldiers” and half a
dozen chariots (Walter Bentley’s idea) will
parade the streets on Italy’s Day. Part of
the procession will (d.v.), include a full-
sized gondola, built of plaster. Maybe this is
by way of making a horrible example of the
Federal Government. Mrs. Plogstead’s
liandy-girls in Martin-place will trade spa-
ghetti, hot waffles and Canadian maple,
civility, smiles and coffee. If you want more
than that you’re an unreasonable glutton.
Lieutenant Sam McCaughey, nephew of
Sam, M.L.C., is home on six months
leave. He has been in the trenches for over
three years. During one of his scanty rests
he found time to carry Una MacKelar, sister
of Mrs. Dr. Dunhill. The bride is in Eng-
land.
The China Inland Mission was last week
entertained by a returned missioner, J. H.
Edgar, F.R.G.S., with strange tales of old
Tibet. The job of handing round tracts to
the pig-tailed community is accompanied
by many and varied adventures. How
the lady missionary gets on when the local
population is rushing around with an axe is
always a marvel to her sisters who find the
boarding- of a George-street tram a suffici-
ently dangerous feat.
H. I. Moffat, of the Inky Way that runs
by the shipping newspaper offices, is the
proud daddy of a young war veteran who
has three years’ active service and the Mili-
tary Cross to his credit. Lieut. L. I*.
Moffat belongs to the Ist Reserve Division
of King Edward’s Horse, and he’s been
fighting in Italy and France. A younger
son, Alan, is with the A.L.H. in Palestine.
At a bag and basket stall in Martin-place,
under the wing of the French-Australian
League, Cora Randal Carey will hang out
the sign of the tambourine on June 28. It’s
about the size of a shilling with the Red
Cross painted on its face. Suspended by
an inch of Italian colors it is one of the
gauds Sydney will dangle from its button-
hole when the Day dawns.
If Cappelli is going to link up with his
countrymen in Italy, as stated a few weeks
ago, he is not saying good-bye just yet. A
business announcement of his “special
engagement” with a local company inciden-
tally warns off any worshippers who were
ready to weep adieu.
Mr. and Mrs. James Smith, of Colebrook,
the house that sits on a shoulder of Bellevue
Hill, have handed over £2703 for another
Australian battleplane. It will fly as “The
Joan.”
Entered up to the account of the Kaiser
another Australian boy of great promise—
Muirton W. Forbes, killed in France before
he was 20. If Sydney Church of England
Grammar was asked what three boys of the
last few years it would like to be judged by,
it would certainly put Forbes in the list.
Besides passing his exams, with credit he
played cricket with the school’s first XI in
1914-5-6, and was captain in ’l6. He was
captain of the school’s XV the same year,
in the school Eights, and lieut. in its cadets.
Enlisting as soon as he could, he went off as
a private and won his commission. His
mother, a widow, had already mourned one
boy.
The Rafalewski duet—the lady hits the
stars with her top notes as soprano Lili
Sharp—are moving off this map. A 12
months’ contract to wander in coffee-colored
lands was the bait. With them goes a Mos-
man girl, Eva Lea-Coates.
Latest London advices about Winifred
Purnell are that the young pianist, who has
studied hard during her years abroad, gave
a successful concert in the air-raided city
to an audience of the proper sort. There
were no bombs to drown the applause.
- The friends of Australian bird-men at the
Front better pin this up. Christmas gifts
are being packed at 59a Wentworth Avenue,
and the packers want help. Grace Stafford’s
Strollers are booked to appear in St. James’s
Hall to benefit the fund on June 26.
Yours affectionately,
VANDORIAN.

GROSS, FEVERISH, BILIOUS CHILDREN
NEED CALIFORNIA SYRUP OF FIGS.
Look, Mother! See if the tongue is
coated; this denotes sluggish
liver and bowels.
Mother! You’re child isn’t naturally cross
and peevish. See if the tongue is coated;
this is a sure sign that its little stomach,
liver and bowels need attention at once.
When listless, pale, feverish, “stuffy” with
cold, throat sore; when the child has tainted
breath and doesn’t eat, sleep or act naturally
or has stomach-ache or diarrhoea, remember,
a gentle liver and bowel cleansing should
always be the first treatment given.
Nothing equals California Syrup of Figs
—“Califig”—for children’s ills; give a tea-
spoonful, and in a few hours all the waste
matter, sour bile and fermenting food clogged
in the bowels pass out of the system, and
you have a healthy and playful child again.
All children love this harmless, delicious
fruit laxative, and it never fails to effect a
good “inside cleansing.” Directions for
babies, children of all ages and grown-ups
are plainly on the bottle.
Keep it handy in your home. A little
given to-day saves a sick child to-morrow,
but get the genuine. Ask your chemist for
a bottle of “Califig”—California Syrup of
Figs—then look and see that it is made by
the California Fig Syrup Company. Refuse
substitutes. All chemists sell “Califig”—
California Syrup of Figs—in bottles of two
sizes, Is. lid. and Is. 9d. [4

Melbourne. June 17, 1918.
My Dear Yarrie, —
Melba arrived on Monday morning and
had a tremendous reception at the
station. Ordinary passengers had the great-
est difficulty in getting clear. The singer
looked younger than when we saw her
last. She was dressed in a cutely-
tailored greatcoat the color of burnt earth, a
neat fur collar, and a jaunty little closely-
fitting hat with wings. The faithful Lemmone
travelled over from Sydney with her and son
George, wrapped in a huge overcoat and a
beatific smile, held her elbow all the way to
the motor-car. Sister Mrs. Lempriere made
herself noticeable in the crowd by a black
velvet belltopper “crewelled” with gay
flowers. Stella Power, smart as a French-
New York-Australian, got a special hug from
Melba. The Conservatorium was in force,
and god-mother wanted to go and practise
scales at once. George Allan and Fritz Hart
carried her off to lunch. Then home to
Coombe.
Genthelp Conant’s movie has been doing
the rounds of the suburbs, where the plutoc-
racy makes vulgah mirth at the badly-made-
up and awkward sassiety amateurs. How-
ever, he’s pleased with himself, and he is
plotting about five more photo plays.
John Madden, the late Chief Justice, left
£29.082. The widow, who is a daughter of
Melbourne’s one-time City Solicitor E’rank
Stephen, will have the income of the estate
for life, and at her death the whole goes to
the children.
The Ladies’ Field, talking of our old
friend Eugenia Stone, nowadays Lady
Doughty, mentions that she has got some
of the way back to printers’ ink: “She has
published in England a charming little book
called ‘The Cheerful Way,’ and contributes
articles to the Grimsby Daily Telegraph,
of which she is a director and part-pro-
prietor.”
The death of Col. Windle St. Hill recalls
that in ’Bl, when he was secretary to Gover-
nor Weld, of Tasmania, Lady W. ran to
him one day with the news that while walk-
ing through one of the passages she had seen
a tall stranger standing on his head in a
room. St. Hill darted away to investigate,
and found that the inverted party was not an
escaped madman but an athlete doctor friend
of the family, who was performing by special
request of her Ex.’s small son.
The lovely Baxter-Bruce widow has
arrived in Melbourne from Sydney after an
exciting few years abroad. She was on her
way to Germany when the world-storm
burst, but she took the right turning at once
and has been war-working ever since. Her
daughter is still in London doing V.A.D.
jobs.
Rupert Clarke is building himself a perfect
bungalow overlooking Sydney Harbor.
Madame Rumor repeats that daughter Amy,
whose husband is at the war, is coming out
to live with dad, and, of course, Madame
Rumor knows all about it.
Victorian squattocracy will be flocking to
Sydney at the end of this month for the ram
sales, many of its female members taking
the opportunity to snatch a holiday away
from Red Cross work. Otway Falkiner, of
Widgiewa, came down to Melbourne and in-
stalled his wife in a flat at Mallock House
before rushing Sydneywards.
Philip Russell, of Carngham, who tore for
Britain as soon as the war started, has
reached his majority with a British regiment.
He’s a son of the late James Russell, of
Osborne House, who helped to make sheep-
historv in the Western District.
John Corlett Teare, of Bennie, Teare and
Co., has raised a family which deserves well
of its country. The eldest boy, Lieut. Athol
Muir, has just returned with a Military
Cross, won for doing his job, though badly
wounded, under a stream of fire. The second
son, Lieut. John Stewart, of the R.F.A.,
sleeps on a French battlefield, and the family
treasures his Cross. Captain Phil, the third,
went from Gallipoli to France with the gun-
ners, and a sister works as hard for the Red
Cross as any of them. The lads were Mel-
bourne Grammar boys.
Of the five children of the late James
Graham, the actuary and insurance man who
died lately, four are in touch with the enemy;
the only one who isn’t is the younger
daughter. The eldest son is a prisoner in
Germany; the second ’listed in September,
1914, and, though wounded thrice, is still
battling in Palestine; the third is an Artil-
lery two-star; and the elder daughter has
been a staff-nurse at Colchester Military Hos-
pital for three years. Father, too old to go
to the war, gave his last three years almost
wholly to war work. He was a typical
generous Scot —granite on one side and velvet
on the other —and reputedly one of the very
ablest actuaries in Australia.
Melbourne has discovered that it has
enough citizens who went to school with
Plaig and Birdwood to surround a medium-
sized dining-table, and has set about forming
an Old Cliftonians’ Association. Dr. W. H.
Lang is one of the “old boys” of Clifton Col-
lege now settled in Melbourne, and Wynd-
ham Heathcote, the Independent parson,
who before the war fell out with the Angli-
can Church, is another. The most venerable
“old boy” yet discovered is a gentleman with
the mellow English name of Bean-Byard.
They’re everywhere. The William Gibbses,
of the Commercial Bank at Shepparton, saw
their boy R.R. off with the first lot; but,
tired of the long wait in Egypt he grabbed
a chance to join the British, and was sent to
Nigeria. He now wears his stars with the
West African Frontier Forces at Kano,
where the great caravans used to come down
from the Sahara, and where you can still
pick up odd bits of Crusaders’ gear.
War is very brutal; but it makes the
Aussie, at any rate, good cobbers with the
lame dog that wants a lift. One late day in
Bourke-street I saw a hunch-backed fiddler,
squatted in the gutter upon a camp-stool,
playing lively tunes while the shoppers drifted
indifferently by. His cap, containing 3d.
and a copper, lay on the ground. Later,
passing the same spot, I saw a crowd of 100
people around the fiddler. He was still play-
ing his lively tunes, but now beside him
stood a returned soldier, holding the player’s
cap for the crowd’s contributions. Cash was
just pouring in, and the soldier looked as
pleased as though he had drawn a starter in
Tatt.’s.
An ex-Melbourne lad, Eric Mackennal,
turned up recently in the uniform of a
Sammie at big brother Bertram’s studio at
St. John’s Wood, London, en route to
France. Melbourne pals had lost trace of
Eric for some time. It seems that he has
been holding down an important railway job
in California.
Keith Dawson, the handsome young cap-
tain, lately of Birdwood’s staff, and A.D.C.
to General Sir Newton Moore, is now Lieu-
tenant Dawson, of the Indian Army. (All
officers recede a step in rank on joining that
army, I hear.) He is at present stationed
among the heights of Beluchistan and is
busily learning five native dialects at once
(five different tribes are represented in his
regiment). His uncle is Private Peter
Dawson, who has just sung his final fare-
wells prior to leaving for the Front.
General Williams, who was our chief
military medico when war began, is back in
Melbourne.
One of the silk flags given by her State
Ex. as a stimulus to Red Cross cash-raising
has been waved to the tune of 1000 guineas.
The sight of this particular flag, displayed
among the bank-accounts of Colac and its
surrounding pasturages, has been like a red
rag to a Yarra-banker. Mrs. Angus Urqu-
hart, of Moondah, representing her neighbor-
hood’s Red Cross branch, was responsible for
the final flap, with a contribution of £lOO.
Lieut.-Colonel Murdoch, Australian Red
Cross Commissioner in London, who is get-
ting six months’ leave, is coming home for a
glimpse of Australia. Lieut.-Colonel Hay-
ward will transfer from France to England
to fill the gap.
To support its June appeal the Austra-
lian Comforts E’und will run a shop from
June 21 at 159 Collins-street. The Irvine
dame will play the overture on the cash-
register on the opening day.
The Adelaide despatch :
The Trench Comforts Shop, launched something
over a year ago, is surprising even the optimistic
committee responsible for it. For one week the
takings were £l5O. The Port Adelaide Comforts
Shop is averaging about £ 25 a week, and has had
to move to bigger premises.
We’ve had an orgy of patriotic concerts —one for
the “Thousand Voices” choir, one for the Y.M.C.A.
Army Department, one arranged by the Stock Ex-
change for the same fund, another with its takings
for the Artillery Trench Comforts Fund and the
Y.M.C.A., one at Walkerville for the Returned Sol-
diers’ Orchestra, and one for the Mission to Seamen
in the Queen’s Hall on Friday night. Even Sunday
wasn’t immune, and that day was fixed for the sixth
of Mr. Grigg’s annual orchestral concerts for the
Minda Home.
The latest private house to succumb to the demand
for flats is the Josiah Symon home at Fitzroy.
Lieut. Walter Price, M.C., son of our first Labor
Premier, has been appointed receiver of revenue in
the Produce Department.
A Military Cross has come to Captain Colin Stew-
art, eldest son of the Engineer-in-Chief, who left
Sydney with* the First Division in October, 1914.
Another S. Australian who has won distinction is
Major (now Colonel) Eric Conran, son of 11. L. Con-
ran, once of Glenelg and now of England. Soon
after war broke out he was flying in Belgium,
where he was severely wounded. Subsequently he
was sent to German East Africa and Egypt, and he
is now to take command of a wing at Huntingdon,
where he was aviation squadron commander before
he last went to France.
Miss d’Erlanger has gone to Melbourne, where she
is to stay for a week or so with the Munro
Fergusons.
Died at Malvern on Saturday W. W. Wilby, Office
Clerk in the House of Assembly for some years. He
was born in India (where his father was at one
time Commander-in-Chief of the troops in Ceylon),
educated in England and came to South Australia in
’ B °. . ,
The U-boats have apparently done for two out of
three cases of pictures that M ill Ashton was expect-
ing from England, including sketches of his own, and
canvases by Streeton, Julius Olsson, Lambert and
others, bought for J. McGregor, of Sydney.
Adelaide put out both hands to welcome Matron
Margaret Graham, who, when war began, had had
20 years’ experience on the city’s hospital staff, and
was head-nurse of the S.A. Military District. She
left with the first contingent, gained a mention in
Egypt, and had the Royal Red Cross pinned to liei
last September.
Three musketeers whose record is worth while are
sons of Mrs. W. Schenscher, of Saddleworth. Her-
bert has just come back with two wounds and a
Military Medal. Ernest has been twice wounded.
Fred has campaigned in Egypt, Gallipoli and France,
and has the D.C.M., gained for rescuing wounded
under fire.
One of the Sproule family, Captain James,
M.C., of the Royal Field Artillery, lately in-
vested in a hoopful of diamonds for the
adornment of Gladys Muriel Chatto, daugh-
ter of Thomas Chatto, Hillside, Estree,
Herts, England. This extravagance was in
celebration of Gladys Muriel’s promise to say
“Yes” at the altar.
Lieut. Walter Turner, a Victorian on ser-
vice with the A.1.F., induced Delphine
Dubuis, a chic Parisian girl, to walk down
the aisle of an old Chelsea Church with him
one day last April. The ’groom, who in
1917 published a book of verses, was sur-
rounded by budding literati at the cake-
cutting.
The English marriage market has absorbed
another Australian worth having—Major Eric
Arundel Wilton, machine-gun officer of the
16th Battalion, who has became .engaged to
Kitty Hanrahan, of Limerick. Eric, who is a
cheerful warrior of 26, was reported killed
in Gallipoli. But it wasn’t so bad as that,
and after convalescing in Italy he crossed to
ETance and won the D.S.O. last year. He
is the eldest son of the Warrawong Wiltons,
of Mount Macedon.
Our old friend F. R. Spofforth, the demon
bowler, protruded himself into the spotlight
in England the other day, at the marriage
of his pretty daughter Vera. Vera, who
is a topnotch tennis-player, said she would
to Major P. S. Youle, of the Royal Garrison
Artillery, at the village of Walton-on-
Thames.
Eily, youngest daughter of the late J. A.
Miller, of West’s Pictures, who was married
the other Wednesday, has been honeymoon-
ing in Sydney. For the ceremony at the
Carmelite Church, Middle Park, the bride
was arrayed in white, including the velvet
hat, whilst the one bridesmaid, sister Mollie,
appeared in saxe blue and pale pink. Inciden-
tally, the ’groom, who was present, was clothed
in pride and happiness and sundry fabrics.
He is Captain W. L. Smallhorn, one of the
Home Territory Department identities, and
has done his bit of service with the A.I.F.
An old knee trouble kept him from the
Front, but he is accused of having been a
valued officer in camp in England.
Pretty little Marie Hall, of Bendigo and
Melbourne, is now Mrs. Russell Sheppard,
tlubby is an air ’busman who was not long
ago sent from England to confer with Uncle
Sam’s aviation experts. lie is a brother of
Mabel Russell, who hit the Big Smoke hard
some months back in “Loudon Pride,” a piece
that failed to draw here.
The wonderful bassinet and trousseau pre-
pared for Nellie Mitchell’s grandchild will
not be wasted. They are being brought out
in readiness for a fresh claimant.
Violiniste Leila Doubleday is coming home.
During the last two years she has been
living quietly in French Switzerland, per-
fecting her art, and now she has decided to
risk the U-boats and show her own people
what 10 years of hard study have done for
her. In Vienna, before the war, she was
the star pupil of the famous Rose, who per-
sonally conducted her concerts in that city.
Amongst the musical critics there she
created a sensation by her amazing technique
and musicianship, and when she stormed
London under the management of Landon
Ronald she earned the most extravagant
praises.
An advertisement in last Saturday’s Argus
invited girls of musical talents to join a
ladies’ orchestra for a tour in Java. One
hears strange stories about what happens to
Joans in these unhandy lands, and a little
careful inquiry before packing the old kit-
bag doesn’t do a ewe lamb any harm. Which
doesn't mean that I have any suspicions in
this case, my dear.
Fred Collier is off to Sydney to arrange a
series of eight popular Saturday-concerts,
beginning on July 6.
Stella Power has grown into quite a hand-
some amazonian type. She belongs to a
numerous family whose hopes for the rising
star are greatly heightened since Melba
became fairy godmother to the girl.
The June Appeal has called up the Will-
o’-the-Wisps, another all-girl show which will
appear for patriotic purposes at The Play-
house on Saturday, June 29 On the roster
are Mrs. Probert, Misses Alexander, F.
Darke, H. Deane, S. Hull, F. Moore, M.
Muntz, E. Retalloek, D. Shaw and J.
Tuthill, and a special orchestra batoned by
Miss Mayston. Napoleon Boffard is to lend
his voice.
Miss Farmer, one of the most energetic
V.A.I). young workers at the Wirth Rest
House for invalid soldiers, arranged a con-
cert for the funds last week, and drew a
packed house to the Home’s big entertain-
ment hall. Miss Farmer possesses a pleas-
ing voice herself. The soldier boys know it
well, for she often warbles to them.
The other morning I saw Marie Tempest
shaming the Melbourne dames who refuse
to carry their own parcels. There came
Marie tripping along laden with a bandbox.
It was the nattiest thing in black and white
stripes, and the carrier wore the nattiest
of short-cut morning frocks. 1 wonder if
she would wrestle with an untidy parcel of
vegetables?
Mrs. Guy Post throwing flowers at her
husband was a feature of the opening night
of “The Nigger,” at the King’s. She was in
gorgeous raiment, and shared a stage-box
with our unimpressive Gaud Mayor and his
spouse. It was an impressive sight to
see at the close of, each act a bunch of
vegetation from the leading man’s missus
lobbing at the feet of her solemn hubby. He
had a strenuous time indulging in gymnastic
love-making with Thais Lawton, whose low-
cut evening-gown revealed a very beauteous
pair of arms. Marie Tempest, who on arrival
moved the gallery to welcoming noises, was
in the front of the d.c. with Mrs. Tallis.
Walter Kirby decorated the circle and Taits
of various sizes were visible in all parts of
the house.
Mrs. Bates Post (Adele Ritchie behind
the footlights) is a shapely madame. Her
feet, especially, are subjects for congratula-
tion, small, graceful and with delicately-
arched insteps. The lady is careful that
they are never seen in busted elastic-sides.
At the Bing Girls’ ball they were encased
in gold brocade slippers.
The Defence Department is finding the
V.A.D.’s very handy nowadays. Latterly a
systematic effort has been made to draw on
the reserves of the St. John’s Ambulance
concern, which has trained thousands of
young women in the first principles of mak-
ing the patient comfortable. A few dozen
girls were some time ago put to work at the
Caulfield and Base Hospitals and at Mont
Park; now the suburban and country cen-
tres have been asked to send along trainees.
This call for help is very complimentary to
the Y.A.D. toilers, who have already made
their mark. It certainly isn’t the money that
fetches them. The rate of pay, for a 12-hour
day occupied with work which is officially
described as “not light,” is 18s. —and not a
word has been said about the provision of
the girls’ white uniforms with the Red Cross
on their chests, nor about the blue, soap,
starch and labor necessary for laundering the
same.
Yours sincerely,
JOHANNA.

TRY MAGNESIA FOR YOUR STOMACH
TROUBLE.
IT NEUTRALISES ACIDITY AND
PREVENTS FERMENTATION.
Before giving up hope and deciding that
you are a chronic dyspeptic, just try the
effect of a little magnesia—not the ordinary
carbonates, oxides or citrates, but bisurated
magnesia, which you can obtain from prac-
tically any chemist, in either powder or tab-
let form. Take half a teaspoonful of the
powder or two compressed tablets with a
little water after your next meal. It will
neutralise the harmful acid in your stomach,
dispel the wind, soothe and heal your in-
flamed stomach, and quickly relieve your indi-
gestion. Many hundreds of sufferers have
gained relief from this simple remedy,
amongst them Mr. P. V. Anderson, of Cooray.
Queensland, who says: “I had suffered from
indigestion for about five years, and had
tried all sorts of treatment without success,
when a friend advised me to give bisurated
magnesia a trial. I am very glad I did so,
for I experienced immediate' relief, and am
now completely cured of my trouble.” Did
space permit many identical experiences
might be quoted, all tending to prove that, if
you keep your stomach free from harmful
acids by taking bisurated magnesia after
meals, you need never fear any serious form
of digestive or stomach trouble. But, of
course, it must be iisurated magnesia—other
forms might do more harm than good.— Advt.
ABORIGINAHTIES
MADE IN AUSTRALIA
BARNES-LINSEED OIL
“Silas Snell”: When we started to sink
th“ shaft of the Blue Peter, out near the State
Forest, Bungaree, we were told of Jennings and
Brett. Neither ever spoke, excepting under compul-
sion, and then with almost incredible brevity. The
two men had beta living within half a mile of each
other in thinly-populated bush country for 20 years
and the tradition was. that once Brett had met Jen-
nings at his slip panels and had said: “Hello ! How
yeh gettin on?” But the legend was covered with
doubt and was much disputed. However, I am in a
position to verify it. I had gone to Jennings over
a contract for slabs, and just then Brett came along,
faltered, as it were, in his walk, and said: “Hello,
Jennings, how’re yeh gettin’ along?” Jennings fol-
lowed Brett with his eye for over 100 yards. He
must have been moved deeply, for he spoke. “Inquisi-
tive 1” he said. “That’s twice he’s asked me.”
“F. Born”: Certain Queensland papers
have been debating of late whether the primitive
Bananaland Warrigal was a cannibal or not. Sup-
pose he was (as our ancestors undoubtedly were, if
you go back far enough), what does it matter?
May he not have been a decent fellow just the
same ? Staniforth Smith, when lost in Papua, fell
into the hands of cannibals, who treated the lost
party with the utmost kindness, fed them and sent
them on their way rejoicing. Smith remarked at
the time: “The great care we had exercised in
seeing that the natives had not been robbed by our
carriers stood us in good stead, and in place of
killing my small and exhausted party, they gave us
all the food they had, although we had nothing to
give in return.” Henry M. Stanley tells us that he
usually selected cannibals for carriers on account of
their superior intelligence and loyalty. Even the
cannibal, if treated decently, does not proceed to
cannibalise you unless your conduct convinces him
that your conversion into dead meat is really the
best use that can be made of you.

“Bouragi”: Many of the native customs
mentioned by “Merrigal”, as Samoan or Melanesian
seem to be observed all over the Western Pacific.
The extreme deference to chiefs was practised by
the Maoris and Fijians particularly. In Papua the
Trobriand natives are the only tribe with any regard
for the claims of high descent. They never stand
iu a chief’s presence, much less walk past him. The
custom of placing a stone in a leaf on a path as a
“no thoroughfare” sign is common in Papua. A
favorite trick there is to knot a vine or long grass
across the track as a 'warning to go back. The North-
eastern Papuan welcomes a visitor by feeling over
and pinching the caller’s arms and trunk, remarking
at the same time what splendid condition he’s in.
Coming from a people who have been and are, when
they get a chance, unblushing cannibals, this is
rather disconcerting, however complimentary.

“Dale”: If “Dugout” (B. 30/5/’18) is the
man who suggested that I should put a pickle-bottle
on my boil, will you kindly forward his name and
address? In accordance with the recipe, the bottle
was filled, with boiling water, emptied and applied
to the tumor-. That started it. My neck began to
walk rapidly down the bottle, and the missus ran
to make sure that the insurance, policy was all right.
When she came back little Willie, the twins and
she concentrated on the glass limpet but without
avail, until a tap with a hammer shook it off. To
my surprise my neck did not go with the pieces.
The boil appeared to be the least upset member of
the household.
* * *• *
“Leo Lear”: The Abo. scribbler (B.
9/5/’18)- who took his oath that strychnine would
not slay pigs was correct. It won’t kill the native
rat either. Last year a colony of these little chaps
undermined my asparagus-bed and were fattening
on the roots. I put out strychnine baits, which were
all taken; but the rats remained. Repeated the
dose; same result. But arsenic did the trick.
STRUCK THE RIGHT MATCH AT LAST.
FAYETTE : "Just look at that stuck-up Joannes girl! Drives all her sweethearts mad
with her nasty temper.”
MARILYNNE: “Well, she's got a good shock-absorber this time.”
WILLING TO LEARN.
“Any previous military experience?”
“No, sir. This is my first war. But I daresay, after I've been in two or three, I'll soon
pick up the game.”
“Tupla”: Here’s the dinkum oil for scrub-
itch. Take even quantities of sulphur and boric
acid, and mix them with fat or oil and apply. Have
cured Binghis with this when they’ve been a mass of
sores.
* * * *
“Yanco”: “Peta” (B. 16/5/’IS) is right
about the prevalence of noxious weeds at Yanco
(N.S.W.). The irrigation area has alien and noxious
weeds in abundance; but stinkwort is scarcely
known. What “Peta” refers to as covering farms
and lining canal banks and roadways is not stinkwort
but bushy starwort, sometimes referred to locally as
Alfalfa sendalis and stick-weed. This, although an
undesirable plant and very unsightly on irrigable
lands, might perhaps justify its existence elsewhere
as a stock feed, as horses, cattle and sheep feed
freely on it when it is young. Yanco is not
at all singular in the deterioration of its land
through the growth of noxious alien plants, and the
stock-carrying capacity of the State is annually
decreasing through the general neglect 'of theft-
destruction. But droughts don’t destroy the curses
free of charge for lazy Governments and shiftless
councils. The seeds simply lie low and . await return-
ing moisture to show up with increased spread and
profusion.
* * * *
“H.V.E,”: Some little time ago an ama-
teur eelologist asserted that he found minute eels,
quite lively, in the floats of adult eels (female, of
course) taken from streams in the Armidale dis-
trict (N.S.W.). Scientists, however, hold that, as a
cast-iron fact, all fluviatile eels resort to the sea
to milt and spawn. But Sir John Hawkins, in his
notes to an edition of Izaak Walton’s “Compleat
Angler,” published well over a century ago, gleaned
the following from a “woman who had been wife to a
miller for near 50 years, and much employed in the
dressing of eels.” She said that she had never found
any spawn or eggs in the eels she opened, but had
sometimes found living eels in them, about the “big-
ness of a small needle.” On another occasion a
“gentleman of fortune” informed Hawkins that he
observed a “parcel of little creeping things about
the sides and belly of a fine large eel that was going
to be dressed.” They proved to be perfect little
eels, or elvers. Yet science holds that this cannot
be. Writer found a brown eel (Anguilla reinhardtii)
in a dying state in the mud of a dried-up water-
course, and beside it lay over a dozen small eels
from about sin. to 9in. in. length. The exact breed-
ing* arrangements of eels are still imperfectly known.
“Digger”: I had learned some of the new
language before I left home.; but I’m not sure
whether these had got into common use in Aussie:
F. 0., file off, get avvay; - gutser (common as dirt, and
quite respectable now), cropper ( e.g to revert to the
ranks) ; hellova, out of the ordinary; jacks, military
police; joe brown, understand; kiwi guards, artillery
or others with polished leggings; p.0.q., imshi
quickly; pin out, at once, right away; wash out, a
failure; whiz-bang, field post-card; woodbine, a cig-
arette (generally “ ’bine”) ; zero, an indefinite date
ie.g., “we’ll be home at zero”).
* * * *
“Umntu”: The Kaffir laborer in France,
surrounded by civilisation’s ■ horrors and marvels,
forgets them all when he first sees Jeanette milk
the cow. It is not the beauty of Jeanette that smites
him, it is her sacrilege! She is breaking what is
to him a time-honored if not a religious custom. The
woman can hoe and reap, and thatch and daub,
draw the water and hew the wood, and generally be
the beast of burden; but to plough the field, milk
the cows, and put up the framework of the hut are
male prerogatives that even the laziest red polygamist
would not forego.
“Aneb”: If “Kell B.” (B. 9/5/T8) knows
anything about breaking in horses he can’t write
about it. I’m no novice at the game, and let me
tell him that breaking in, and well at that, is far
better rewarded at 30s. per head than “educating”
a horse would be for £3. He evidently knows no
distinction in the three phases of a horse’s curricu-
lum. The animal must be handled before he’s
“broken,” and broken before he’s educated. The
first can be done well in three days with an average
beast, the second in from 10 days to a fortnight,
according to conditions; but the last takes any old
time over three months, and is rarely met with in
Australia outside the principal shows. If “Kell B.”
will educate an unbroken colt for £3 he’s cutting
down wages to a level unheard of hitherto. I’ve
never seen a hard-and-fast system with much to favor
it yet. Like schoolboys, all young horses must go
through the same routine ; some get their certificate
long before others, and it’s there that the school-
master or horsebreaker shows his brains. All large
horseowners are sick of showmen with gears and
“ideas.” Australia is indeed badly off for brainy
breakers, but, notwithstanding regular outbursts of
“Kell B.’s” and other systems, the old, old routine
is the one that survives.

A Comparison of Galvanised"iron
Roofing with
Certain-teed
rhe Ideal Roof Covering .
1. Scarcity. —The world’s supply of
metal has been curtailed by its use in
tremendous quantities for the great
war.
2. High Cost. —The big demand for iron
has increased its price to extraordinary
high levels, and indications point to
its continued high price after the war.
3. Heavy Weight. —The thinnest corru-
gated-iron used for roofing is 28-gauge,
and weighs about 851 b. per 100 sq. ft.
4. Rusts, Corrodes. —Iron roofing easily
rusts, a.nd will corrode and disintegrate
by atmospheric gases.
5. Heat. —Iron absorbs the
heat from the sun and transmits it to
the building underneath, and the heat
is retained in the building over night,
even though the temperature is cool
outside,
G. Hard to Handle. —Iron is heavy, and
as i* comes in large sheets it is bulky
to handle, thus requiring more time
and money to ship and to lay on the
building than Certain-teed.
1. Large Supply. —Being manufactured
out of waste materials, of which there
is always a large supply, any quantity
of Certain-teed is always assured.
2. Economical.— Certain-teed in normal
times has always been cheaper and
better than iron. To-day its price is
still so low that iron can’t be com-
pared with Certain-teed.
3. Light Weight. —l-ply Certain-teed
weighs 351 b., 2-ply 451 b., and 3-ply
551 b. per 100 sq. ft.
4. Nothing Affects It.— No gases, acids,
fumes or vapors of any kind affect
Certain-teed.
5. Insulates Against Heat. —Certain-
teed Roofing insulates against the
most terrific heat, making the building
cooler in the summer and warmer in
the winter.
6. Easy to Handle.— Certain-teed is
put up in compact rolls, which are
easily handled when shipping
when applying to the roof.
Certain-teed stands for Satisfaction and Insurance against all
Roofing Troubles. Call and let us give you more facts concern-
ing its superiority to all other roofings.

REG? NAME FOR
HEAN’S ESSENCE
Private PETER DAWSON, the world-famous Baritone, who recently
enlisted, has been a consistent user of HEENZO, the great money-saving
Remedy for Chest and Throat Troubles. Writing on September 1, 1916,
he said:
“I have had occasion to use HEENZO (HEAN’S ESSENCE), and
am glad to say a few doses dispelled a cold that had troubled me
for several weeks.”
COSTS 2/- SAVES 101-
The treatment of Asthma, Bronchitis, Colds, Influenza and Sore
Throats calls for something that will destroy disease germs from the
throat and bronchial tubes, soothe and heal inflamed mucous membrane,
loosen phlegm, and tone up the general system.
For this purpose money cannot buy a better medicine than that, a
pint of which anyone may prepare in their own homes in a few moments
by adding HEENZO (registered name for Hean’s Essence) to warm water,
and sweetening as per easy directions supplied with each bottle. As
HEENZO costs only 2/-, and a pint of ready-made cough-mixture would
cost at least 12/-, it will be seen that a big money-saving is to be effected
by making your own cough-mixture.
HEENZO GOUGH DIAMONDS
are lozenges medicated with HEENZO.
They are fine for the VOICE and THROAT. Price 1/- per tin.

"Pick": If you want to hoar a truly
entrancing wild-bird musical performance, try waiting
at dawn beside one of the unfrequented coastal lakes
of the X. S. Wales south coast until you have had the
rare luck to witness a gathering of the black swan
clans. W hat the birds meet for I do not know:
but occasionally, as though by pre-arrangement, they
assemble at daybreak on the shadowy surface of one
of the many lagoons. In regular Y-shaped forma-
tions, with a deep-voiced leader in the van. they
skim along the beaches and over the headlands, and
as each fresh contingent arrives at the rendezvous
a mighty chorus of welcome goes up from the
assembly. W hen thousands have blackened the water,
their massed clarionet band in the morning stillness
is a treat to be remembered for a lifetime. At sun-
rise the gatherings break up and the musicians depart
to their accustomed waters.
“Steve Hart": Stewart the squatter had
300 acres down on Possum Creek which he wanted
fo have ring-barked. So he put up a notice outside
the pub offering Is. 6d. an acre for the job. But
the fossickers on the creek weren't having any under
half a crown. Stewart rose threepence, but still the
miners sat tight. Then one day Bill the bullocky,
who brought the stores (mostly beer) once a fort-
night, said that Stewart had a returned soldier with
a “crook” leg on the job. “It’s that bloke over the
range at Rowdy Flat,” he explained. “The cove that
married Nell Thomas arid went; to the war shortly
after.” “Well, Stewart’s a miserable blank,” said
old Jim, “to take advantage of a man who fought
and bled for him and his 50,000 acres, not to men-
tion his sheep artd c-attle. I’ll bet lie’s only giving
the bloke Is. 0(1.,, or less.” Then, with a sudden
thought, lie asked: “Does the poor bloke go home
on Saturdays?” “Yes,” said Bill; “leaves at dinner
and goes to the Flat till Monday.” Turning to the
crowd Bill said: “What do you say, lads, about
putting in Saturdays and Sunday to help him out?”
The suggestion was received with cheers, Mick
Flood remarking: “There’s over 40 of us here, and
JUDGMENT.
MINE CAPIN: “One av 'ce said ’e ded, and
the other av 'ec said 'e dedden, so
between the two av 'ec, where are ’eel"
we could finish it easy on Sunday. It’ll give that
Mister Blanky Stewart a nasty bump to pay up so
soon.” At one o’clock on Saturday afternoon the
creek was deserted, but from beyond the ridge c-ame
the sound of over 40 axes delving into the timber.
At four o’clock next afternoon the 300 acres were
finished. Monday evening, when the Creek was busy
stopping pints of beer, old Stewart drove up to the
pub door. “Eh, men,” he said. “I hae misjudged
ye. I thocht ye wouldna work fer me. You done
me a gran’ turn. I had the soldier at the ringing
on weekly wages, and though you hae taken his job
frae him, you’ve done me weel. Here’s a bob or
two for ye; buy some beer.” He drove off leaving
the population of Possum Creek paralysed. But. to
give him his due he paid the soldier the one and
nincpence. though the mob didn’t know that till the
bullocky came with more stores.
‘Leo Leai*” • I’m no authority on wasps,
but I can assure “Ornie” (B, 16/of’lS) he ia mis-
taken tn thinking that none of the Australians sting.
There is a small Bananalantier that builds a nest,
the shape of a mushroom, about two or three inches
in diameter, and if any gent, wishes to test his
devilish propensities all he has to do is to be inquisi-
tive about the structure. I found out all about it;
I couldn’t breathe through my nostrils nor see for
an hour. Another stinging fellow constructs a long
rhin nest, hanging for preference, on a wire fence.
They live in colonies, and if you doubt their stinging
qualifications let your horse brush a settlement with
his tail. Unless you can ride like a Featherston-
haugh your prad will be a mile away before you’ve,
bounced off your ear twice.
"Eme": Ever tasted eagle-hawk flesh ?
If not you’ve missed a dish comparable with any
poultry. Lobbed upon a rabbiter’s camp recently
and was given “chicken” soup. Informing me as to
the source of the good thing the cooky summed up
thus: “Eagle-hawk ain’t any worse in its livin’ than
a pig or a duck.” I couldn’t deny it. “Orlright,” he
says. “Bog in.’’ 1 bogged,
“Steve Hart”: If you ever have any
trouble with the brownie sticking to the camp-oven,
dump it (the oven) on a wet bag for five minutes
and the bun will roll out first tip.
“Idr. Nil”: Can any Abo. explain to me
how the jumping spider, sitting upon the side of a
perpendicular wall, can spring an inch up it in pur-
suit of a flying ant ? It sounds easy, but it is really
something like the problem of standing sideways
against a wall with one foot touching it, and then
raising the other foot without falling down. Any-
how, he done it—l seen him.
“The Wanderer”: What’s the cause of
this? Xowendoc (N.S.W.) is periodically plagued
with grasshoppers, and during their visits the local
hen eggs cannot be eaten. Yolk and white are blood-
red, a result of the .chooks swallowing the insects.
* * ■* *
“A. Fisher”: Great fun being stung by
the small arid inoffensive looking bullrout. Three
to four inches is about his average length, but even
if he is only an inch long he can produce something
special in the way of agony. Shaped like a baby
codfish, he looks as though he has been browned and
burnt in a. frying-pan. A sting from one of his fins,
or an incision by one of the half-dozen almost invis-
ible lancets set. round the outside of the gills, is
calculated to send even strong men
stark rnad for an hour or two and in
some eases for a much longer time.
I got pronged in the second joint of
the first finger of the right hand,
which was rendered useless for a
couple of days. For from 15 to 20
hours the hand and forearm were
paralysed and I had three ligatures
below the elbow to stop the. poison
spreading. I overlooked “first aid’’
when I omitted to gash the finger
and let the blood run ; but then I was
nearly “dilly.” For the first minute
the pain was no worse than a half-
hearted bee-sting. At the end of the
next 60 seconds it was easy to imag-
ine that half a dozen wasps had been
working overtime on the spot. There-
after the agony intensified at a terrific
rate, driving a bead of perspiration
out of every pore in my skin. More
than once I took stock of myself to
see if I was all there. For two
hours I kept my block with the aid of
a mixture of scalding water and
Condy’s crystals, wherein- I held the
troubled hand. Deliverance from the
nerve-shattering ordeal came in the
shape of a snake-bite antidote. A few
nicks with a razor round the affected
spot, a drop of the dirty-looking fluid
in each cut, and the pain began to
vanish as if by magic. In less than
five minutes only a dull, sickly throb-
bing remained, and that continued
for something approaching 48 hours. It was
“Rooky” Vane’s antidote that did the trick. Am
credibly informed that Morrissey’s snake-bite cure is
just as effective, applied the same way.
* * * *
“Wandi” : The brush-turkey (B. 23/5/T8)
arranges her-eggs in this fashion. First a cavity is
formed deep down in the mound of decomposing
vegetable matter, and into this the eggs are put in
position with the foot, small end downwards. Leaves
are scraped around and trodden down, and the hole
is filled up and the top well trampled. Eac-h time
an egg is laid a part of the nest is dismantled and
covered up again. The first four are placed one at
each corner of the crater, eight to 12 inches apart,
and covered with three or four inches of material.
Then the second tier is begun, each egg of which is
placed in a space midway between the positions of
the lower ones. Only two tiers are completed the
first year of laying; afterwards 12 to 16 eggs are
deposited. The mound is heaped up until the top
tier is burled to a depth of over two feet. Incuba-
tion lasts nearly six weeks, throughout Which period
the mound is regularly opened up and scratched
over. There may be an interval of two weeks between
the hatching- of the first and last eggs. When they
have worked their way out the chicks have to look
after themselves. They emerge full-fledged, how-
ever, and are naturally independent of parents from
their birth.
WELL AND TRULY EARNED.
“ What-o. Bill? Who give per the black eye?"
"No one gimme it. I 'ad ter blarney well fight for it.”
“C.8.H.” r If there is any part, of Aus-
tralia where snakes are more vicious than in the
bills between Foster and Boolarra,. South Gippsland
(Vie.), I'd be obliged for'the address so that I can
keep away from it. Within the last few years there
have been eight fatal eases of bite and in one family
alone three females have been bitten. Women and
children seem to be the principal sufferers, no doubt
on account of the snakes’ preference for the warmth,
shelter and food about the houses. Domestic workers
are obliged to put their hands into odd corners, and
thereby often land right on top of a crawler, while
the children stumble on them in Jhe long grass.
*** f *
’A inelcaf”; Bill had been persuaded by
the travelling photographer to have, his phiz taken,
and, with his cobber Jerry, was scrutinising the
proof. “It ain’t a very good photo,” he reckoned-
“ What!” said Jerry. “Why, it’s the dead ring of
yer.” “No blinkin’ fear,” asserted Bill. “The shirt
I had on was pink.”
“Quidam”: Some people say there is a
sort of secret-society business among tramps, swag-
gMes, knights of the road, hoboes, or whatever you
like to call them whereby information is dissemi-
nated regarding soft snaps for tucker, tobacco, etc.,
and also spots where little but hard work is to be
obtained. Some assert that cabalistic signs convey-
ing valuable hints as to the hardness of the wood-
heap and the appetite of the family dog are en-
graved on gate posts and so on. Certainly I lately
had a run of unfortunate gentlemen who hadn’t had
a bite for 24 hours, but looked hale and hearty
men under the ordeal, and each one, besides enough
tucker to carry him along to the next mug, obtained
a certain quantity of tobacco. Incidentally none
offered to attack the domestic woodheap in return.
The pronounced reluctance of tramps to personally
cut firewood suggests that all of them are married
men with a wife somewhere or other. Probable
nothing has led to so much domestic strife and
divorces as the common or backyard variety of
v/ocdheap. Yet with all the opportunities so chival-
rously allowed her for practice, woman as a rule
uses an axe in a painfully awkward manner, agitat-
ing it straight up and down in a stiff ungainly way
that clearly shews she wants about 1000 years’" more
practice before she develops the easy, graceful style
which man so willingly exhibits before matrimony.
Fortunately she has every possibility of getting the
time allowance. The last tramp who asked for
tobacco was given a variety which, in a moment of
rashness, I had purchased for about 3s. 6d per lb.
Outwardly its appearance was very fair, but other-
wise it was not charming. Since that act pf dubious
genero.at. no tramp lias disturbed my peace, and the
question that now arises is whether this is merely a
coincidence, or do the matters have a distinct and
definite bearing the one on the other'? If the latter,
and the continued absence of tramp deepens this
.conviction, what a magnificent opening there would
be for someone to put on the market an unusually
obnoxious and altogether vile brand of tobacco for
the special use of people who live adjacent to main
roads! Even that deserving but struggling institu-
tion the Tobacco Trust might amass enough wealth
by such means to pull it out of its present pitiable
condition.

DANGER
lurKs at every Greasy Corner!
It’s bad enough on a highly cambered country track, with
the possible chance of ditching your car if the tyres
don’t grip —but it’s ten times worse in city traffic, where
your car might “run amok” amongst pedestrians or other
vehicles. The most careful driver is absolutely powerless
at times to arrest a side-skid— -if the tyres fail to
grip when the car is checked. Sometimes necessity calls
for use of brakes—the wheels lock, but the car skids
forward and anything may happen. Again, the
brakes are applied—and in a flash the car is side-ways
on— - ■■■■■and anything may happen. Many a
Motorist’s heart is in his mouth —when he’s
crossing a greasy patch. To the Motorist who is anxious
to minimise these troubles, we strongly recommend our
DUNLOP
PAILBOAO
RUBBER NON-SKIDS.
These scientifically constructed covers give a
really wonderful grip on greasy surfaces —either
laterally or driving. They hold when other
patterned covers are skidding, and further —
they are the finest wearing tyres for
continuous hard driving on any road.

The Aged and Infirm
are sometimes more susceptible to COUGHS and COLDS on the
CHEST than the young and vigorous. When an aged person gets
a Cold, it is of the utmost importance that not only is the BEST
REMEDY taken immediately, but that the Remedy is one that
does NOT cause any Heart Depression, nor in any way weaken
an already frail constitution. In such a case, HEARNE S Bronchitis
Cure is just THE proper Medicine to use, as it is the QUICKEST,
SAFEST and BEST—a Remedy that ia just as effective with
YOUNG PEOPLE.

the train is starting. And a dizzy exposition
of arithmetic puts many things that seemed
plain in a figurative light. “Nine” is “spoil”
or *‘booty,” which explains why nine of the
10 lepers didn’t come back, whereas we
thought they simply walked on. A hundred
isn’t really a number; it means “rescued,”
wherefore the joyous tone of Psalm 100.
Every Government, it appears, puts the
people in bondage. “The correct way is to
reduce the number of laws to the fewest pos-
sible,” which is a hard saying for a modern
people, but easy for those who had no pave-
ments to be expectorated on, and no traffic to
keep on the proper side of the street, also
no street; and who didn’t forge another
man’s name on a cheque and send it to the
bank and get the money, because there was
no bank arid no cheque and no money (bar
oxen), and not much other man, and nobody
could write.
As already mentioned, the book is worth
reading, for the things that are in it and
for the things that would be in it if there
was more of it. It is a blessed departure
from sordid daily affairs. The author —who
blushes anonymous in front of the publica-
tion, but signs himself “A. R. Ward” at the
rear —knows his subject, whatever it may be,
from A to Z. And after finishing the tome
it is like falling all the way from Dan to
Beersheba to ask a bank for two sovereigns
in exchange for a small cheque, and be told
that gold is only obtainable in Melbourne.
The Inky Way
Melbourne daily pressmen, occupying
places wherein they are demanded of con-
science to speak the truth, do in their spare
time turn for relief to fiction. Percy Rodda,
of the Age, who has placed a book with the
N.S.W. Bookstall Co., is the latest addition
to southern newspaper-novelists, who include
Roy Bridges (dramatic critic of the Age) ;
a predecessor in the job, Alf Buchanan;
Ambrose Pratt (until recently Age leader-
writer and now editor of the Mining
Standard) ; ‘George Cockerill, who thun-
ders for the Symes in Pratt’s place;
Donald MacDonald, “Observer” of the
Argits ; Oliver Growden, leader-writer on
the Herald ; and Charlie Barrett, the
Herald’s gentle nature-study expert, now
on active service.
“J.F.H.”: Here is a record in the Inky
Way that is not likely to be lowered. When
editor of the Pall Mall Gazette, John
Morley had just started writing a leading
article, when he received an urgent sum-
mons from Gladstone. Before the interview
was over Gladstone, as Prime Minister, had
made Morley Chief Secretary for Ireland
and a Cabinet Minister. Then Morley re-
turned and finished the article. Another
journalistic anecdote told by John Morley.
Parnell asked him for a look at the draft of
Gladstone’s first Home Rule Bill in order to
have a consultation on its provisions with
half a dozen of his colleagues. Morley de-
murred, fearing premature disclosure and
consequential unknown complications. But
he eventually agreed and no leakage what-
ever occurred. Afterwards Parnell told
Morley that three of the members to whom
he had shown that draft were newspaper
men, who could certainly have sold any
article they chose to write about the bill
for a thousand pounds.
Books Received
Ceorge Matson, who died in 1915 and enjoyed
during his latter days a literary pension from the
Commonwealth, was the long-distance verse-writer of
Australia: he had been doing it for 59 years. The
result is a collected volume of 134 pieces entitled
Australian Poetry (V. K. Jones, Ltd., Perth). The
preface, by Mary A. Juleff, indicates the appreciation
in which Matson was held by people as widely
parted as Ada Crossley and Flag-Commander K. Mori-
yana of a Japanese warship ; but the chief interest
of the work lies in the running commentacy it pre-
sents on the public events of the writer’s long years.
There is no great poetry here and the skill is slight;
but the verses are harmless and kindly and show
occasional insight. Here are three quatrains as good
as any in the book:—
The cold philosopher will say
That this thy last cold bed
Is good ; but can he preach away
The fact that thou art dead?
He sees not with thy mother’s eyes,
Nor can the sophist know
The meaning of the melodies
That filled me, thrilled me so.
For when you held my heart, and played
Upon . its willing strings,
My spirit through the future strayed,
And pictured joyous things.
Memory’s Voices, a booklet of war Versus by May
Kidson (Gordon and Gotch, Perth), is dedicated to
the author’s son, who was killed on service. It rings
throughout with patriotic fervor. Always behind
the verses you see the brave mother smiling through
her tears; and that is probably why they have been
of such value to recruiting in the West. Little war
verse will stand judgment by severe literary stand-
ards ; but at least this is sincere and sometimes
poetical. Now and again the authoress soars high
in sounding phrases, as when she asks
“Shall the locked music of a warring world
Break into woven sounds of melody?”
Still, the chief value of the little collection lies in
the fact that it is a mother’s war book.
Maslii and Other Stories.- —This collection of
Indian tales is by Rabindranath Tagore. They are
very quiet, almost devoid of violence or fierce exer-
tion such as croquet. In “The Supreme Night” a
disconsolate lover and his lady, then another man’s
wife, are marooned in flood-time on an island of
three square yards. They don’t speak nor do they
touch each other, and in the morning they go their
separate ways. “The Postmaster” is a slim young
colored person who does his business in a small
shed in a small village. The small orphan girl who
odd-jobs for him loves him. In his small way he
loves the small girl. When he resigns owing to
small salary or something he goes away and she
doesn’t. Some of the tales are more fierce even than
these. (Macmillan and Co., London).
Business, Robbery, etc.
“Murkah”: Regarding wireless, “Arthur
R.” (B. 23/5/T8) asks some questions. The
difference in signal-strength between day and
night transmission is always equally
marked; it does not vary with the seasons.
When Marconi first suggested the possibility
of trans-Atlantic wifeless, attention was
immediately directed to the “mountain” of
water which rises to a height of 150 miles
between the nearest points of Ireland and
Canada. “That’ll stop him,” said the ex-
perts. But it didn’t, and on December 12,
1901, a wild day, the first signals were shot
across the ocean. The fact that the signal-
waves didn’t shoot off into space was con-
sidered by a man named Heaviside to be due
to the presence of a reflecting layer in the
upper atmosphere, which kept deflecting the
waves down to earth. This theory has
since been generally accepted and the name
“Heaviside layer” given to the deflecting
stratum. The effect of sunlight on this layer
is to considerably reduce its reflecting pow-
ers. Therefore more of the wave-energy
“gets through” during daylight, and that is
the best-supported theory for the reduction
of range during the hours of sunlight. Per-
sonally I believe that this feature is more
marked in the Northern than in our own
Southern Hemisphere.
“Orlop”: Shipping terms and arrange-
ments tell of queer survivals from old days.
A “charter party” is the latter-day equiva-
lent of the Latin carta partita, under which
the Mediterranean shipowner of 2000 years
ago prepared his agreement in duplicate, cut
it across the middle through some particular
word or figure, and swapped halves with the
charterer of his fast and favorite trireme.
Long before that, again, Noah’s famous
voyage was undertaken on a verbal charter
party, faithfully carried out. “General aver-
age,” the common law of the sea, under
which individual loss incurred for the safety
of the ship and cargo—as, for instance, in
jettisoning deck-cargo in a storm—is paid
for by a contribution from the other inter-
ested parties, was well understood and acted
upon by the Phoenicians. The bridge of a
modern liner is the direct descendant of the
plank which used to be thrown across from
one paddle-box to the other in the earliest
steamers for the convenience of the captain
when bringing his ship into port. The wheel
was then on the quarter-deck, sailing-ship
fashion. The stern galleries of a warship
were originally the latrines for the after-
guard, and the heavy scroll work from the
figurehead to the luff of the bow served a
similar purpose for the crew. The Navy
Regulations still refer to the sanitary accom-
modation for the crew as the “Ship’s Head.”
“The Oldest” : An ancient building has dis-
appeared from the south-east corner of
Market and Pitt streets, Sydney. In the first
’forties it was (of course) a pub kept by
William Toogood. In 1850 it was The Cali-
fornia, kept by one Douglass. Five years
later Thomas Spencer named it The Exhibi-
tion. In the ’sixties it was kept by McGlone,
the detective who arrested the bushranger
Frank Gardner: he got the reward and used
it to buy in. When Gardner was released
after 10 years he made his way to San Fran-
cisco, and there McGlone, who had done no
good, became his barman. Since that time
the old pub has been a bank and a softgoods
store, and upstairs Tom Slattery and Louis
Heydon chased Costs, and often caught them.
* * * *
“Erraw”: What’s gone wrong with the
pig industry? Last harvest I had a quantity
of unsaleable wheat, and was advised to go
in for swine. I plunged on “porkers” which
are now “baconers.” A few weeks ago I
wrote to the nearest bacon factory for (1) a
quote for prime baconers, and (2)the charge
for curing pigs for customers’ domestic use.
Reply: (11 If prime and choice, 7d. per lb.
carcase weight at factory. (2) l?d. per lb.
carcase weight for a pig, and all by-pro-
ducts, feet, head, lard, etc., returned. The
same week I bought a side of bacon which
cost me Is. 63d. per lb. Now, 7d. + l|d. =
B^d.; 18|d. -81 d. = lOd. I want to know
who is getting that lOd.? (I may say. I
am writing this behind the pigsty while
the missus heads off pig-breeders who want
to give me “suckers.”)
* * * *
“S.D.”: “E.S.S” (B. 2/5/’18) did not
mention that the Queensland Pine Co. didn’t
get busy over the manufacture of. paper till
the Lands Department got on its tracks.
Hunter, the Minister, saw that, in the lib-
eral agreement which the co. had made with
the late Denham Government, provision
was made for the utilisation of treetops for
pulp manufacture. But the co. had not
made a move, so he told it to pulp or pay
an increased royalty. The co. woke up
suddenly, and a sample of pulp (for brown
wxapping-paper) which has been manufac-
tured is declared by the co.’s imported
American expert to be equal to the best
U.S.A. product.
* * * *
Melbourne reporters laughed over an in-
cident at the Inter-State Commission’s in-
quiry into the working of the cash-order
system. A drapery man was under exami-
nation, and lawyer Joe Wolff, appearing
for the co. that runs the system, asked
him whether the firm had received a cer-
tain letter. He referred the question to one
of his colleagues in court, who said “No,
no.” Whereupon the lawyer, having got this
authority to repeat his “No” whilst out of
the witness-box, put him into the box and
repeated the question. Then the terrified
draper, with the penalty of perjury before
his eyes, meekly changed his “No” to “Yes,”
and was told to get away and feel ashamed
of himself. The joke came after the close of
the proceedings, when the crushed witness
complained of being badly treated.
* * * *
“Croson”: It was natural for the mill-
owners’ deputation that lately spoke with
Vic. Minister of Agriculture Oman to object
to the presence of the press, but it was un-
fortunate the journalists learned enough to
interest the public before they departed.
Now it is known that the harassed flour-
millers vented their griefs at Oman because,
the 1915-16 wheat “having absorbed all the
moisture it is capable of absorbing, they are
unable to add further moisture, and conse-
quently their profits are affected.” “Profits”
is rather a good word in this connection, and
reminds one of the milkman who poured rain
into his cowjuice—until gaol deterred him
somewhat. The public has long been aware
that wheat absorbs moisture from the air,
more rapidly near the sea—formerly to the
great advantage of the wheat-merchants—
but it had hitherto no idea that the flour-
miller speeded-up Nature by himself adding
as much water ds the grain would hold —and
selling it as flour, of course. One Melbourne
miller casually told Oman that in 1916 his
firm could add 2000 oz. of water per hour to
the wheat then being gristed, whereas now
it could add nothing. So the poor firm
was obviously If tons short on each day’s
output. And the water cost only lfd.! No
wonder they wept.
*.* * *
“Metacentre”: Some of the coastal steam-
ers can —or could before the War Devil
broke loose —be used to illustrate the pro-
gress of modern ship-development rather in-
terestingly. The Coolgardie, built about
1884, is the original flush-decked pattern,
with only a forecastle, small bridge, fiddley,
and short-house aft for officers. The Roto-
mahana, of a later year, has extended her
bridge well aft to cover the fiddley, and has
moved the short-house further forward. Then
along comes the Aramac, unites the poop and
the original bridge and fiddley into one long
promenade deck, and puts the working bridge
a storey higher. The Wodonga improves on
that by putting her boats on overhead skids,
built up from the bridge deck. Then the
Wyandra replaces the boat-skids by another
deck running forward to the break of the
bridge. The Wyreema goes one better again
by covering in the forward well-deck of the
Wyandra, which brings her back to the
original Coolgardie, but one storey higher.
The Kanowna puts cabins on the top deck
of the Wyreema type and adds another deck
above to carry the boats and the officers’
quarters. Finally the Karoola continues the
promenade deck of the Kanowna aft, and
builds up the forecastle head above the for-
ward flush deck, giving practically two
storeys on the original Coolgardie model.
For all these additions careful allowance is
made by giving additional beam to main-
tain stability, and the built-up ship, top-
heavy though she may look to the untrained
eye, is actually stiffer and safer than the old
low flush-decker.
“The middleman is necessary just as long
as the manufacturer and retailer will stand
him,” says the managing director of Pelaco,
Ltd. Which is to say that, as regards Aus-
tralian products, the middleman lives on the
lack of mutual organisation between the
manufacturer and the retailer. As a stocker
of imported goods, however, he is practically
a necessity to small buyers, and must. con-
tinue to exist in a diminishing form until the
range and output of local manufactures
covers all public requirements. The first
aspiration of a people should be to push him
out of business. The importer is the enemy
of patriotism and the waster of labor which
might be productively employed. Yet to see
him presiding over a gathering of merchants
you’d think him indispensable and a benefit
to the community!
“R.8.J.”: It would be interesting to know
why N. S. Wales Education Department still
runs its School Savings Bank. Two other
banks and a war-savings scheme not only
encourage thrift, but pay interest, which the
rchool bank doesn’t. It doesn’t cover localities
neglected by the other banks, because in the
hamlet so microscopic as to contain
neither bank agency nor post office the school
is below the grade that runs to the dignity
of a bank. If it were a source of revenue —
that is to say if, by allowing the kid no in-
terest on his money, while re-banking the
same coin and collaring the resulting interest
—a surplus could be shown, there might
be some excuse for not slaying the old mon-
strosity. Just to prevent any nasty, sus-
picious person getting the idea that the
whole concern is for the sole purpose of
keeping several well-paid and perfectly use-
less jobs in existence, some figures should be
published.
* * * *
“S.” : Our occasional rabbit-o leant against
the doorpost and unbosomed himself. He was
wreathed in blood-stained bunnies, and a
cigarette-butt drooped sadly from the corner
of his mouth. “This ’ere game isn’t wot it
useter be. Before they fixed the prices on
me, I was makin’ a steady two-poun’-ten a
day an’ wot I could get for th’ skins, l
can’t do it now. Goo’day, Missus.” My
husband is a civil servant who “keeps up
appearances” on about £7 a week—after
years and years of study and work. . My son
is growing up and the University is before
us, but I’m wondering whether it wouldn't
be better to buy him a barrow.

What shall the scholar gain, though oil he burns,
Night after night, until the morning grey
Peers through his frost-dimmed lattice and discerns
Him poring' o’er some tome? Can learning stay
Time’s march, or stop the passions’ wild affray?
Mad sage, what hopest thou to gain as fee?
Upon thy precious parchments worms will prey—
Thou shalt a tale, a ghost, and ashes bel
What shall the miser profit, though he turns
From simple joys that gild the beggar’s day?
Not all the golden guineas that he earns
His waste of golden sunlight can repay;
The hours when love and laughter meet at play.
Base miser, though thou hoardest greedily
Thy gold, thou canst not thus transmute thy clay—•
Thou shalt a tale, a ghost, and ashes be!
What gains the lonely anchorite, who spurns
The pleasures keen that thrill the sinner gay?
The flesh that he denies still aches and yearns,
And virtues shall not save it from decay;
While women smile contempt, ’twill go the way
Of that of lechers. Madman, canst not see,
Who each God-given ecstasy dost slay,
Thou shalt a tale, a ghost, and ashes be!
Envoy.
Comrades, while shines the gracious sun, make hay!
Joy mocks at mad ambition. Struggle free
From all that keeps life’s rare delights at bay—
Thou shalt a tale, a ghost, and ashes be!

Time Has Proved Adamax the
Best Roofing Money Can Buy.
If you want facts read on:—
44,000 square yards were used on the South
Australian Wheat Board Building. 20,000
square yards on the Leeton Canning Factories.
13,200 square yards were ordered for the W. A.
Government Freezing Works at Wyndham.
22,000 square yards for the Commonwealth
Buildings, Canberra.
Then big orders were placed by the Murrum=
bidgee Irrigation Commission and for Messrs.
Upton & Co. Ltd.’s Factory, Sydney.
The men behind these orders didn’t buy on sentiment —they were
keen business men who wanted full value for their money. They
made exhaustive tests with
ADAMAX
Asphaltvm Roofing
and proved for themselves its Economy, Reliability and Service-
ability. It costs one-third the price of galvanised-iron and very
much less for freight.
Rust, Rot and Decay have no effect on it—acids, chemical
fumes, rain, wind, heat or cold harm it not. It resists fire, and
whilst it is 12 to 14 degrees cooler than iron in Summer, it gives
an equally greater warmth in Winter. Can be laid on roofs with
a very low pitch, showing a big saving in roofing and roofing
timbers.
Let us send you the Free Booklet, “The
Adamax Series,” which gives facts in detail.
The Public Works have Adamax on their

POLITICAL
POINTS
Mount Elliott, the big Queensland collec-
tion of mines, which ought to be producing
copper regularly for the Allies, has had
another strike. But even when it hasn’t
got a strike what the I.WAV. calls “the flea”
is at work. General-manager Corbould
describes the pnpcess.
You _ can detect nothing wrong except that there
are minor breaks and the plant is hung up for a
while. Then a few days’ rest from that—nothing
wrong now except the production. Everybody work-
ing, nothing doing. They endeavor by all means
possible to so worry the manager that he closes the
works, which is a “lock-out.” Or you have a fine
body of men who are satisfied and contented. The
fleas are set to work, and you soon get a request for
some concession. You refer them to the Arbitration
award. If you make it clear that you are keeping
to the award the matter ends so far as the Com-
mittee of the A.W.U. is concerned. But the fleas
get to work to out the committee, and they often
succeed, because disgusted men say, “Oh, damn the
meetings!” and won’t attend to protect their own
interests. So the fleas win.
Ir all reminds Corbould of the boys who put
up ,a joke on another by throwing the half-
cooked dinner out into the yard. It seemed
a very good joke, too, till dinner-time.
A MORAL VICTORY.
, “The people of the Upper Hunter (N.S.W.) were
right behind the Labor party’s peace proposals. The
contest was really a message of peace to the Labor
party, and if it remained solid it would soon not
need to go cap in hand to any Nationalist party and
ask for re-registration of unions.” —Defeated candidate.
The Hun : “That’s right, my little man,
let’s bury the hatchet, and then yon need
never go cap in hand again to anyone
except me.”
The Commonwealth Government an-
nounces gaily that last year it made a profit
of about £250.000 out of rabbits and rabbit-
skins. Had it made the same percentage of
profit out of the turnover of sheep and sheep-
skins and wool the squatters of Australia
would have been about £5,000,000 poorer and
the Commonwealth revenue about that much
richer. It is sometimes an advantage to be a
squatter and not a rabbiter. A good deal
depends upon who is Prime Minister.
The Tasmanian Government, after much
shuffling over shipbuilding during the past
12 months, looks to be holding a bad hand.
When the Federal Government ordered two
5500-ton steel vessels the other day the
Devonport slip was selected on which to
build them. A day or two later Captain H.
Wood, of that town, secured an order to
build 20 wooden vessels for a private firm,
and where the Government’s hard luck
appears to be is that most of these boats
will be constructed in the Wilmot elector-
ate. An influx of a couple of thousand
laborers will probably cause the bare Liberal
majority to evaporate at the next general
election. Premier Lee and Minister Hays,
both Wilmot representatives, may not even
get into the new Parliament.
Following on the scandalous extravagance
which resulted in Queensland’s railways
last year producing a deficit of three-
quarters of a million, the Government now
STRANGE.
GERALDINE: “ Strange! So far there -is not
a word in the hook about, how to worK
without working!”
proposes the good old remedy of raising
fares and freights and reducing services.
There was once a man who got into the
habit of drinking two bottles of whisky a
day. Presently he found that he couldn’t
walk upstairs to bed. So they brought his
bed down to the ground floor. Then every-
thing was all right. The Great Reform had
been accomplished.
J. M. Niall, manager in Melbourne of
Goldsbrough, Mort and Co., in depreciation
of meat-price fixing:—
_ High prices will bring about their own remedy.
Unduly high prices must inevitably cause increased
competition.
Wherefore unduly high wages must also in-
evitably cause increased competition; so J.
M. Niall w T ill presumably tell his squatting
friends that there is no need to go on the
offensive. Let ’em put up wages : high wages
will bring about their own remedy. Either
that is so, or Mr. Niall’s attack on the Gov-
ernment for regulating the price of meat is
unjustified and his arguments are nonsense.
“303”: Sergeant Thomas Ryan, of the
Victorian Assembly, said recently in Martin-
place, Sydney : “Of the 709 members of Parlia-
ments in Australia only five are to be seen
and heard on the recruiting platform.” Yet
more than half the elected members were
returned as enthusiastic Win-the-War
patriots. Now, going back to 1915, before
the draft was applied, this was how the
British House of Commons showed up. Of
Unionists 140 out of 288 members were on
active service—say 49 per cent. Of Libs, and
Labs., including followers of Asquith, Haldane
and co., and all the talking lawyers and
traders, 40 were on service out of 298, say
14 per cent.; of Nationalists (Irish) two
members out of 84, say 3 per cent. Aus-
tralia’s record even of recruiters is a frac-
tion of one M.P. per cent. After getting
elected the vast majority don’t even trouble
to kill the Kaiser with their mouths.
One possible reason for the haste to bring
back wounded Australian soldiers without
even waiting for them to get their wooden
legs before leaving is that it is advisable to
get them to a place where they can be paid in
paper money. The Government has just
issued another £3,000,000 of it.
N. S. Wales Labor’s new policy is to
make a mess in order to have the chance of
cleaning it up. Isn’t there enough mess on
the premises already to grapple with?
From the Gallery :
The greatest hindrance to the swift despatch of
business in the Reps, is the presence of females in
the Speaker’s Gallery. Most of the ladies are mem-
bers’ friends, and as many have dropped in to hear
their hero spout, he is bound to do it. You will see
members, immoderately silent on a measure where
their opinion would be valuable, open their faces on
some piffling little matter before a petticoated audi-
ence. The amount of patter mostly varies according
to the age and complexion of the congregation; two
or three reasonably pretty girls will be the means of
giving the Hansard reporter Pitman’s elbow. But
there- are other men who are bound to provide plati-
tudes simply to maintain their domestic ascendancy.
The idea that no man is a hero to his wife is dis-
proved a thousand times by the air of conscious pride
with which a particular lady watches the gyrations
of her hubby in the House.
Four big countries, the U.S., Canada,
Japan and Australia, have been in the war
for some time —three of them from the be-
ginning—without being invaded, blockaded
or even bombed. Three of them are doing
well out of the war. The U.S. has increased
the value of its exports 300 per cent, since
the row started, and it reckons that it will
have 25,000,000 tons of shipping afloat at
the finish of the scrap instead of the pre-
vious 5,000,000 tons, and will have got back
the job of the world’s boss sea-carrier and
marine parcels-delivery. Japan has increased
its exports 500 per cent, and its mills and
shipyards are working all round the clock.
One of its shipping companies recently broke
the monotony of life with a dividend of over
TOO per cent. Canada’s exports have gone
up 400 per cent., In 1917 they reached
£317,000,000 and after paying for imports
the country had over 111,000,000 sovereigns
to collect. Australia’s exports (£98,000,0001
have gone up merely about 25 per cent, and it
only drove the first nail of the Government’s
shipbuilding programme the other day.
Nothing at all has happened to its manufac-
turing industries. In an industrial and com-
mercial sense it has become a place sugges-
tive of the sleepy old parish with thatched
cottages and moss on the church roof.
In this apologetic country the Hun agent
or Hun sympathiser whirleth about continu-
ally, and no one interferes with him. At
Wolfram (Q.) the miners wanted an award
and Judge Macnaughten gave it. The miners
refused to obey it and looked at the law
as they might at a dead rabbit. So Judge
McCauley gave a better award. The miners
refused that and demanded more, and the
employers conceded their demands. And the
strike went on just the same. Apparently
the secret is that the metals produced at
Wolfram are used for munition-making, and
the I.W.W. or pro-Hun agencies have de-
cided that metals of that sort must not be
produced. Nobody has been tried for treason
up to date.
Senator Gardiner is reported as stating in
Parliament that the alleged Australian Labor
ideal —peace without indemnities or annexa-
tions —would simply “leave every invaded
nation in a pre-war condition.” So it would
—barring the women on whom rape has been
committed; the women, children and non-
combatant men who have been murdered,
tortured, enslaved, starved or mutilated;
barring the vast indemnities that have
already been exacted from the occupied dis-
tricts, in money, food, machinery, coal, iron,
live-stock, oil and anything else that was
valuable and portable; also the towns and
villages and farms that have been obliter-
ated, the years of industry that have been
lost, the loss of years of education to multi-
tudes of children, the mental wreckage caused
by living amid horrors that never ceased, and
the thousands of millions of debt incurred in
putting up a defence against the possibility
of even worse happenings. All these things
have been suffered, not by the Hun, who
hasn’t been invaded yet, so that his pro :
perty and his unarmed population have
escaped, but by the peoples—mostly the little
peoples—on whom the Plun has made inva-
sion. It suggests an affable ghoul dancing
beside a deathbed to talk of any pacifist
programme putting the Hun victims “in a
pre-war condition.” God couldn’t do it, let
alone home smug, well-paid, well-fed poli-
ticians, unless He put back the clock of the
universe and gave us yesterday.
“J.G.”: The reference to D. Percy Rus-
sell (B. 6/6/T8) recalls that he made his
Federal elections debut in 1910 when he
contested Ballarat in the Labor interest
against Deakin. The contest was about
the most exciting in the Commonwealth, as
only a handful of votes separated the com-
paratively unknown miner and the Prime
Minister. At one stage of the count Deakin
had the horrifying feeling that Russell was
going to out him. Mostly by the aid of the
“postal” votes Deakin scraped in with a few
to spare. That was Deakin’s last contest, as
he retired from politics before the next elec-
tion.
Trotsky and Lenin, the two Hun agents
with false names who manipulated the comic-
tragedy of Russia, have at least the merit of
velocity. It. is less than /15 months since
fheir revolution r&ised the wn.ges of scoven-
gers in Petrograd to £6OO a year. Now the
bread ration for what remains of Petrograd
is down to 2oz. per day.
THE NEW LUMINARY.
DER KAISER: “Ach! Dot look like mein evil
star.”
Since the days of Batman or thereabouts
Victorian Governments have promised a
decent Scaffolding Act. Now the unions
have grown weary and propose to make the
law themselves —and administer it them-
selves. The Building Trades Federation has
drawn up regulations covering scaffolding of
all sorts, bracing, ladders, ropes, splicing,
hoists, lifts, shearlegs and the rest of the
paraphernalia; and if they are not observed
on any job then the workers will be with-
drawn. So far Parliament has taken no
notice; but if it continues blind and deaf it
may ,be sorry afterwards. If a community,
or sections thereof, find they can make their
own laws and carry them out to suit them-
selves they will presently want to know
what’s the use of Parliament at all.
N. S. Wales Attorney-General Hall, who
has just returned from China:—
There are no factory laws there; no education
laws; no workmen’s compensation; no arbitration
courts. I saw children under ten years of age work-
ing in the cotton factories 12 hours a day. The
wheels never stop from one year’s end to 'another,
except on the Chinese New Year’s Day. Thousands
of children start at six in the morning and work till
six at night. They grab a little lunch at their
work. At six o’clock at night they are replaced by
thousands of other children—and so the thing goes
on, seven days 1 a week, and 52 weeks in the year.
Yet the good Australian unionist will pro-
bably keep on cheerfully “sinking the fiscal
issue,”' thus permitting the output of the
sweated Chinese to be imported into Aus-
tralia. . How long does the fiscal-sinking
Australian unionist think his protective
Labor laws are going to stand up against
that sort of thing?
According to N. S. Wales Labor-leader
Storey (Parliamentary report, 14/(>/T8)
I believe that the workers can not do wrong.
In that case the Almighty may consider Him-
self superannuated. If the Creature becomes
infallible simply because he is a qualified
blacksmith or office-cleaner or musician, the
Creator seems superfluous.
“N, S. Waler”: What makes me feel more
tired than all other things put together is
the spectacle of two Houses, comprising 142
great hulking members, passing a bill that
weighs an ounce and a half.
BALLADE OF THE CLEAN SCUTCHEON.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
We do not pray that war may go
And leave Australia scatheless all;
In this grim time of death and woe
Such hope, in sooth, would idle fall.
But when this hellish strife is o’er,
And others tell of what hath been,
Pray Heav’n they boast on this our shore:
“Our fathers kept our scutcheon clean!”
Pray Heav’n they boast: “Our forebears brave
They fought and bled for this dear land ;
They did not ape the cunning knave
Who skulks and draws no gallant brand ;
They did not say, ‘Let England's blood
And France’s blade in flashing sheen
Redeem Australia’s Nationhood!’
Thank God, they kept our scutcheon clean !
“They did not bide in peace at home
The while they knew that ‘aliens’ bled
To save Australia’s cot and dome
And hold in freedom each dear head ;
It was not theirs to lounge at ease
And keep a brow sedate, serene,
While others ‘sailed through bloody seas’—
Thank God, they kept our scutcheon clean !”

WORMS,
ONE NINE INCHES LONG AND ANOTHER FOUR
INCHES PASSED BY CHILD AFTER TAKING
COMSTOCK “DEAD SHOT” WORM PELLETS.
Mrs. A. E. Bade, of 203 McKillop Street.
East Geelong, Vic., writes:—“l have great
pleasure in writing to you to let you know
the satisfactory results I had in using your
‘Dead Shot’ Worm Pellets for my young son,
aged 14 years. He had been ailing for some
time and complained of pain in the spine and
a very sore stomach, and often in the night
would start vomiting without any warning
whatever. He also had several fainting
turns. I became alarmed and took him to
the doctor, but the treatment did him no
good. I then thought I would try your Worm
Tablets, as to me he had every appearance of
worms. I procured a bottle of them, together
with a bottle of Indian Root Pills, and com-
menced the treatment. The second day after
taking them he passed a stomach worm nine
inches long, and the next day one four
inches long. Since then he has picked up won-
derfully and is twice the child he was. If he
shows any signs again I will not hestitate to
try them, as I was so pleased with the results.
lam most grateful to the proprietors of these
tablets, as my husband is away on Active
Service, and the worry of our boy being so ill
nearly drove me mad. Thanking you again.”
STOMACH WORMS.
A MENACE TO CHILDREN.
Stomach worms are undoubtedly the most
invidious kind of all. They inhabit the
stomach and inflict great havoc upon their
victim. They deprive the victim of half the
nutriment he consumes, and when the stomach
is empty gnaw the sides of the stomach,
causing such terrible sensations as to often
cause faintness. Aperient medicines have no
effect upon them, for when any purgative is
taken they fasten themselves to the walls of
the stomach by a groove running down their
side. The best method of dislodging stomach
worms is to starve the system and take Com-
stock’s “Dead Shot” Worm Pellets. Tie
worms are weakened by the want of food,
and are induced to take whatever is taken into
the stomach. Comstock’s “Dead Shot” Worm
Pellets contain the properties which sicken
and disable the worms, and a dose of opening
medicine will clear them out of the system.
Comstock’s “Dead Shot” Worm Pellets
are a purely vegetable medicinal preparation
for the eradication of worms in children and
adults. For sale by all chemists and store-
keepers, price 3s. 6d. per packet, or will be
sent post paid at the same price by The
W. H. Comstock Co., Ltd., 23 Lang Street,

FLATTERING
Imitations in Exactly Similar Bottles.
It has been stated that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, and
if this statement is true the public who have been using Dr. Morse’s
Indian Root Pills for years should feel highly flattered in having its
judgment regarding the merits of this remedy confirmed by a number
of imitations which are at present on the market, some of which
are in exactly similar bottles. Although imitators may copy the type
of bottle and label, and even the advertising accompanying the
packet, they can only imitate Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills—they
cannot produce anything like them. See to it that only
Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills are secured, and politely resent imitations
or worthless substitutes.

Weights for the Grand National Hurdle
Race seem to flatter the chances of, say, Pistolier,
Bundong, Bardol, Will Comfort, Fastolf, Nick-a-Jack
and any of the new recruits among the light weights
that can jump a bii. and are not yet ancient. Bun-
dong, with only 71b. more than he carried into
second place last year, is undoubtedly well treated,
for he is now only a comparatively young fellow as
jumpers go. Pistolier, too, is very well in it at
10st. 41b. if he has improved in his method of
getting over the sticks. Clever jumping, even
where hurdles only bar the way, counts for much
in a fast three-mile go. The doubt about Bardol is
as to how he jumps, but he is backed as though he
were sufficiently expert, and he looks as well worth
picking in a “double” with say, Samander or Caibye
as any of them.
Last year there was nothing in the same class
with Caibye and Old Mungindi over the big jumps.
They have gone up a lot in the weights, but are
nevertheless preferable on paper to all the proved
chasers, bar Samander, a recent winner over the
Flemington course. This six-year-old, with 9st. 81b.
for his load, strikes one as being the pick of the
handicap for the G. N. Steeplechase. Culluleraine,
on the same marks for age and weight as Samander,
is probably faster, but has not yet been proved over
the stiff Flemington course. On present appearances
it seems probable that there will be warm favorites
before the day for both Hurdle and Steeple, and that
the books will sigh in vain for a rank outsider to
turn up.
* * * *
The Hurdle Race at Moonee Valley last
Saturday suggested that imported horses are going
to have a say in the three-miles event on July 6.
Calais, one of Tye’s lot from England, won a two-
mile race from end to end with Will Comfort chasing
him ~ and St. Anthony (also imported) in respectful
attendance. In the Steeplechase old Booligal came
to the front again. For the first time since long ago
Booligal was handicapped below 12 stone at the
Valley'. He won easily, after allowing another nag
to make most of the running. Samander, much
fancied by many people for the G. N. Steeple, had a
fall in this race and lost a lot of his popularity by so
doing.
* * * *
Weighed out for the Final Handicap at
Melbourne, Joe Carter, the oldest jockey in Aus-
tralia. Joe’s first important winning ride was in
the Victorian Derby on 11. N. Simpson’s Flying Doe.
That was away back in ’56. Afterwards he piloted
winners of big races over the line in Tasmania,
Victoria, N.S.W. and M.L. He weighed in at 85
years, 60 of them spent in the Commonwealth.
* * * *
The Kaiser has killed Melbourne Winner,
the sporting adjunct of the Herald. The bright
little paper had the misfortune to be born just as
the European pot boiled over, and the price of infant
food is now unbearable.
* * * *
“Trot”: It seems a pity the A.d.C. does
not put on a real steeplechase menu at Randwick
for the winter meeting. Cross-country horses are
poorly catered for in N. S. Wales, but there can be
little doubt that a bit more encouragement would
bring more animals into the game, as in Vic. The
placing of a hurdle race regularly on suburban pro-
grammes has brought an increased number of
jumpers along, and though some of them are not
champions, lepping has improved a lot during the
past season. If the A.J.C. tabled two hurdle races
and two steeples on each day of the winter meeting
and staged a distance race on the flat under welter
weights, such a meeting would be just as popular
at Randwick as it is in some parts of Maoriland.
Races for “novices” and two-year-olds and sprinters
could well be cut down. They are at it every week
all the year round.
* * * *
“Whip” : The “humble petition,” lately pre-
sented to the Premier of S. Aus., asking him to look
into an alleged gross injustice perpetrated by the
Onkaparinga Racing Club in 1915, seems to have
fizzled out. The Club offered to give the profits at its
first meeting after the war started to the Belgian
Relief Fund, and it handed over £315. The petition
says that the gross profits were £2OOO, and that
the Club has always refused to render a proper
account to the Fund. The fact is that the Club has
. one big meeting every' Easter Monday, and that is the
only one in the year; so the takings on the day
have to cover the expenses of management and up-
keep for 12 months. Premier Peake has gone into
the matter afresh. The Belgian Fund committee
says that it has never made any remarks beyond
acknowledging receipt. of the £315. The police
assert that they found that the Club’s auditors, well-
known and responsible men, had certified that the
balance-sheet was a proper and accurate account.
The suggestion is that the movement may be a per-
sonal one aimed at Von Doussa, the secretary, though
he has spent the 70 years of his life almost entirely
in the service of the public, is still M.L.C., and has
practically no knowledge of nor interest in the coun-
try his name was originally hatched in.
* * * #
“Barbwire”: At the Charleville (Q.)Show
some years ago the Hunter’s Plate was just over and
some of the hurdles had been knocked down. The
man whose duty it was to see that the hurdles were
put in order after each “jump” was absent from the
ring—evidently gone for a pint. The next event
was “Best Lady Rider Over Hurdles,” and one of
the officials was very troubled at the hurdles not
being ready for the event, and decided to drive in
the pegs himself. So he bawled: “Where's the hax?
Bring in the hax.” The bellringer started off to
announce an event which was almost the last one
on the programme. “All hacks this way, please. All
hacks this way!” and immediately the ring was
crowded with ladies’ hacks. The official was para-
lysed. “You fool!” he groaned. “X said the
hax —not the hacks!”
* * * *
“Gleniris”: The Age has devoted a Satur-
day “special” to a general criticism of the up-to-date
horsewoman, in top-boots and riding-pants, who
straddles her nag instead of draping both feet (etc.)
on the near side of the animal. Reference was also
made to “hippy” women, who ought to be at home
looking after Little Willie, but insist on making them-
selves conspicuous on horseback. The tendency of
the times is to shove womenfolk out into the open
air as much as possible for exercise and exhilaration.
Now, which does the most in this direction—the
smart, safe pair of pants and simple seat, or the old-
fashioned skirt and pronged saddle, which gives the
rider the plaintive appearance of some wild thing
clinging to a cliff? Nowadays, plenty of “hippy” women,
instead of increasing their girth 'by rotting around
in the old arm-chair, are reducing their “hippiness”
by getting out on hubby’s hack while he is at work.
The greenery-yallery miss of the afternoon tea-table
is rapidly changing into a broad-chested, breezy
damsel, full of healthy energy and a sound outlook
on life; and the healthiest and broadest-chested ones
are certainly those who give the' loud laugh to
gran’ma’s saddle, hanging cobwebbed in the toolshed,
while they go forth from the horse-paddock in useful
corduroys, holding themselves aboard with both
thighs as Nature built them to do.

Sid Godfrey persists in winning the war
at Sydney Hippodrome several times a week. Heavy
reinforcements have been provided by local feather-
weights, but grave fears are entertained of the
reserves becoming exhausted. A 1 King was the last
reinforcement. He took Godfrey’s offensive on the
chin in the third session, and Dr. Dave Smith ordered
removal of the outed to the nearest casualty station.
* * * *
“Silas Snell”: Boxing in Melbourne was
almost down and out; but hope revived a little
when Jimsie Wills, heavyweight champion of Tas-
mania, put in an appearance. An opponent was
found for the huge ex-miner from Zeehan in Dick
Turnbull, Pride of the Port, a hefty lumper who
had eaten up three bucolic champions, including
“Spud” Just, the Warrnambool Wonder. The Tas-
manian champion was liberally advertised. He had
a string of performances a yard long, and patrons
looked for a sanguinary battle. Among the hangers-
on at this date was one Teddy the Hen, a lank, pale-
faced, lantern-jawed, long-nosed street urchin, who
was employed about the hall by the promoters.
Teddy the Hen occasionally boxed a preliminary, or
served as pasting post for a pro. in training, and as
general receiver was a wonder. The Wills-Turnbull
fight was a Victoria Hall fixture, and it drew a full
house at three, two and one. The champion of Tas-
mania was easily first favorite: it was generally
understood that he was going to bring Australian
boxing into its own again. A featherweight prelim-
inary was being fought, when a sudden diversion
arose as a result of the attempt of a large man with
a face like a knotted box-block to drift from
the 2s. to the 3s. seats. Teddy the Hen, lanker and
paler than ever, was holding the pass. The immense,
plain person insisted. Teddy resisted. The enor-
mous one aimed a blow at Teddy, like Hercules
heaving a butcher’s-block. Teddy slipped it easily,
planted his left, swung his right,/ and the heavy
fellow with the dreadful face fell in the gangway
and lay outspread, dead to the world. There was
silence in the house for 10 seconds. Then arose an
ominous murmur which swelled to a cry of anguish
as the truth soaked home. There would be no super-
fight that night. The giant on the floor, asleep, to
all appearances, for a week, was Jimsie Wills, cham-
pion of Tasmania, and standing over him, eager to
resume hostilities, was Teddy the Hen!
“Hugo Knapp”: This goes as the greatest
scrap in Cobar (N.S.W.). A while back a number
of I.W.W. men came over from Broken Hill to teach
the Cobar miners how to run their industrial affairs.
They were not overwhelmed with welcome, and this
seemed to surprise and vex them. Anyhow, bad feel-
ing grew up and peace folded its wings and retired
pending the inevitable clash. This came one night
recently, at an I.W.W. meeting in the main street.
A disciple of sabotage had just mounted his box
when, at a prearranged signal, Cobar delivered its
punch. Up and down the street the battle raged
and the best the police could do was to act as un-
official masters of ceremony, steering contestants away
from plate-glass windows and picking up the
wounded. You can buy I.W.W. stocks in Cobar
to-day at seven for sixpence.

League football in Sydney sparkled up on
Saturday when A. McPherson casually booted seven
goals for Western Suburbs against Annandale. The
same sure boot has piled up 19 goals during the
season.
* * * ■*
Herb Gilbert, the bulky skipper of the
Western Suburbs outfit which is making a splash in
Sydney Rugby League games this season, is a much-
travelled enthusiast. Many years ago he represented
N.S.W. against Maoriland; then, after touring Eng-
land with an Australian team, he pitched his tent in
the Cold Country and played the Northern Union
game for a few winters. He returned to Australia
three years since and pulled on a jersey for Eastern
Suburbs. Last season he incorporated himself with
the Wests and topped the club’s efforts with nine
tries. On Saturday he crossed Annandale’s line
three times.
Home again at the end of a three years’
sprint after Abdul and Fritz, Major J. H. P. Eller,
formerly a well-known Essendon cross-country runner.
He breasted the tape in a fierce stunt in France, where
he won the D.S.O. for bombing a German machine-
gun out of action single-handled, capturing a pillbox
and consolidating his objective. He is not 40 yet.
* * * #
“Wart”: Major A. A. (“Lex”) Evans,
who has just been handed the D. 5.0., was one of
the best all-round athletes the Speck has turned out.
If he did not reach inter-State championship form it
was because he never specialised, but had a go at
every sport that came along, on land or water, and
won trophies at them all. He fought in S’Africa. and
was a lieutenant in the local battery of artillery
which volunteered in a bunch on the outbreak of
war. On Gallipoli he gained a captaincy and a
Military Cross, and in France he was given a
howitzer battery and the major’s crown.
W. J. Stack, who recently won the D. 5.0.,
swung a bat for Sydney ’Varsity and N.S.W. Xl’s in
pre-war days. Cricket runs in the family. Old man
G. B. Stack was in Ma’s XI of ’66.

“Q.”: The hills of the N. S. Wales central
tablelands resound these days with the fox-hunter’s
gun. The sport has become popular and it is profit-
able, too, for skins are worth 7s. 6d. or 10s. apiece.
I recently unearthed a single-barrel b.l. weapon to
take a hand, and it seems a remarkable implement.
At 70yds. it deposited 33 No. 1 shot in a kerosene
tin, it slew a fox at 90yds., and executed a hare at
104yds. I got the weapon, then a dirty, unused
thing, for 10s. at a cocky’s clearing-out sale. No
sport could get it now for a fiver.
“J.C.”: According to “Tarwin” (B.
16/5/’18) the rabbit-shooting stunt of Burdy (S.A.)
would be very quick work, as to slay 778 rabbits in
10 hours means a shot every 46sec. Nothing very
expeditious about that if the meat transpires. But
tyiere have been really quick things done with a gun,
and O’Shannessy, a Gippsland trooper, did one of
them. When stationed on the Lower Tarwin he
was a man of exceptional skill with the trigger. lie
made a match to shoot against time under these
conditions: The gun to be in pieces locked in its
case on a table. At the word “go” the case to be
unlocked, gun taken out and fitted together, 10
glasses thrown left and right at 30yds. to be
smashed, the weapon dismantled, put back in the
case and locked up. All this to be . done inside one
minute. The performance was attached to the menu
at a local sports meeting. Tom Lees, then a well-
known racing man, was timekeeper. Whalley and
Roily Woodville, then of Inverloch, were referees.
O’Shannessy finished his contract in 42sec. He was
a marvellous shot with gun or service revolver, and
always performed with both eyes open.
* * * »
“G.L.H.”: Shooting with a shotgun at a
hare going crossways fully extended, at 35yds., using
heavy cartridges, what allowance should be made
for time before the shot reaches its mark?
“Duglio”: Fritz isn’t the only game for
sportsmen in France. A notice just tacked up on
our board reads this way:—
Complaints have been received that men have
been using their rifles and machine-guns in
Forest, for the purpose of shooting game.... Au-
stralians appear to be the worst offenders.
Billjim always seems to be in the thick of it when
there’s killing to be done 1
* * * *
“Rarawai”: “Old Dad,” the cook of a
D.A.C., is an ardent fisherman and whenever we
camp near a canal the old man can always be found
soaking bait. Recently the horse lines were being
shelled, and all hands were ordered to take cover.
When the strafe was at its thickest we noticed Dad
pottering about in the open. “Get under cover, you
1” shouted the s.m. “What are you doing
out there?” “Looking for a bit of lead to put oh
me fishin’ line,” chirped the placid fossicker.

Oswald Caust, dead of cancer in Adelaide
at 42, was a fine natural cricketer who never quite
got to the high places where he seemed to belong.
He had three stages: As a punishing batsman in a
country district, the “lower North” of S.A.; at
Broken Hill, where he captained the local team
against an English XI; and as wicket-keeper (and a
heavy scorer) for the Norwood Club in Adelaide at
a time when about seven of its teams were already
in the best XI of S.A., and it was hardly possible
to put any more of them in. Like another and
greater wicket-keeper of a past generation, Alfred
Jarvis, Caust had been a blacksmith. It is a great
profession for hardening the hands.

Worth noting is the regularity of A. C.
Kitchen in the handicaps of Sydney Walking and Field
Games Club this season. In three starts he has
won twice, and on Saturday he just failed to con-
cede J. W. Batger 40sec. in a mile. This speed in
the pursuit of sideboard trimmings has brought
Kitchen almost to scratch with top-notcher E N
Smith.

“Yass” : So N. S. Wales fisheries officials
are capturing cod in the over-flow lagoons and water-
holes of the Murrumbidgee, and liberating fry and
mature fish in Burrinjuck dam. Likewise, according
to Chief Sec. George Fuller, fishing thereabouts is
to be prohibited for three years “to admit of the
speedy development” of the place as a fishery. Fuller
might as well get coal for Newcastle. He speaks of
21,000 fry having been turned adrift. Well, I have
fished at the dam many times and will swear there
are more than 21 thousand billion fry there already.
With a mate and a dozen hand-lines the catch has
run up to about lcwt. a night, the take ranging from
two to ten pounds each. Cod are fearful cannibals, and
consume fish up to a fourth their own weight. More
fish are scoffed in a night at the dam by other fish
than the few individuals who go there with hooks and
bait could catch in a year. As matters stand
Fuller could send a trawler to the dam and supply
half Sydney with fresh food daily. All this piffling
round with fry and closin £ the dam is foolishness.
The shutters are up during the spawning season and
that is enough.

“J.R.K.”: Cure for “Morwong’s” catfish
sting (B. 9/5/’18). After trying many remedies
1 ye come back to bathing in hot water or poulticing
with hot bread. Tie up the affected part and keep
warm. If the sting is on the sole of the foot, add
a little permanganate of potash to the hot water and
bathe. This latter also applies to the bite of the
stinging-tree, common in North Queensland.
* * * *
“The Wanderer”: Talking about the 181 b.
(dressed weight) caught recently in the Manning
(N.S.W.), the fisherman, Ben Ford, was the same
who discovered the two oldest inhabitants of the eel
family at Kimbriki, on the river. The pair were
arrested in a trap. One weighed 441 b. and the other
371 b. (undressed). The head of the big fellow was
preserved, and can be seen by any doubter
* * * *
“Snapper”: If my friend Smethers, a
professional fisherman, is not called to give evidence
before the latest Victorian Royal Commission on
fish he ought to be, for he has the root of the matter.
Smethers points out th&t if we had copied our black
brothers in the matter of the supply of butcher’s
meat we would have found it even harder than it
is now to get the family joint—kangaroo or ’possum
—and pay for it. It is even worse in the case of
fish, for, while you can go hunting or snaring on
land in any weather, a storm may at any time stop
fishing for days. What Smethers wants to do is to
encourage the breeding of tame fish, which can be
kept in paddocks and used for slaughter when it is
too rough to go hunting wild ones. If porpoises
could be trained to act as sheep-dogs and so save
the expense of fencing, all the better.

“A.M.1.E.E.” : Re “F.N.T.’s” (B. 16/5/18)
paragraph on the steam-driven motor-car. He
is correct in saying that Australia’s first car was
so propelled. This same car was the first of the
family to do the overland trip from Sydney to Mel-
bourne. The main source of trouble was the kero-
sene burner. This would go on strike as often and
readily as Broken Hill workers; when it did work
the smoke from the fuel filled the boiler tubes and
prevented steam generation. Inventor Herbert Thom-
son, of Armadale (Vic.), devoted himself to the per-
fecting of this part. He eventually succeeded, and
I recently heard that he had sold the patent rights
in his burner to the White Co., of Cleveland
(U.S.A.).

Despite streaks of grey under his hat and
wrinkles on his brow, Horace Rice, the veteran Syd-
ney tennis champion, still whips a hefty volley
across the net. After conceding long starts he last
week landed the Red Cross tournament handicap, and
on Saturday he and partner Kidston won four sets
(6-1, 6-1, 6-2, 6-2) in A-grade club matches. Horace
gathered his first championship 24 years ago.


DEEP BREATHING IS THE VITAL
FORCE OF LIFE
The Passport to Good Health.
It is oxygen that gives the blood its sparkling, redness—
the body its warmth and energy—that makes it possible
for the food we eat to be transformed into bone, muscle
and tissue.
Since it is the duty of the lungs to supply the blood with
oxygen, deep breathing should be the foundation of every
system of exercise. V
A great majority of people are shallow chested —sufferers
from oxygen starvation —and yet they wonder why they
are fatigued, depressed, under weight—why their vital organs
fail in their duty.
The deep-breathing exercises included in my
Postal Course of Health
and Strength Culture
are most modern, efficient and successful.
They build up weak chests by strengthening the lungs,
developing the muscles supporting the chest walls, broaden-
ing the shoulders, and making you breathe in a natural
way.
The exercises you receive will be those most suitable for
your individual physique, just as the particulars you fur-
nish tell me you require.
I have written a book entitled “HEALTH AND STRENGTH
FROM SELF-CULTURE,” which tells all about my methods,
fees, etc. It will be sent to your address on request. Just
write your name and address across this advertisement and
post it to me. I will know what you mean. Send three .

9 Things tine Motorist
should Remember
1. One of your smallest expenses—lubrication—is your
chief safeguard against your heaviest expense —depre-
ciation.
2. Friction is relentless.
The effects of the incorrect oil will not be apparent
during the first piston stroke or the second. But
when piston strokes run up into millions —and that
does not take long—friction begins to get its due.
You need not look for the effect of wear then. You
can hear it.
3. We have solved the problem of scientific lubrication.
4. If given intelligent care and scientific lubrication,
your car should run better the 2000th mile than theS
first. !
5. No matter how freely a low quality or wrong-bodied
oil is used, it can never do the work of the correct,
lubricant.
6. No one oil will suit all cars. This is absolute.
7. You selected a car that suits you. Now select an oil
that suits your car.
8. Though you may want correct lubrication, you will j
seldom stumble on it by chance.
9. The Lubrication Chart, printed in part on the right, ■
was prepared only after an engineering analysis of
every car. It represents our professional advice, and
specifies the correct oil for your car.

Somehow, though it had a strikingly good
start, this co. isn’t making the progress that
it ought to, notwithstanding that it allows
(1) consignors of wool 20 p.c. off, reducing
the selling charge to 2 p.c.; (2) consignors
of fat stock 10 p.c. off, making the selling-
charge 21 p.c.; and (3) something unspeci-
fied off the selling charge on general produce,
from which concession consignors got £515
last year. The wool business keeps steady :
last year’s consignments were apparently
40,284 bales as against 41,961 bales in the
year to March, 1915. In the Ilomebush sec-
tion. however, whereas 385.918 sheep and
24.123 cattle were handled in 1914-5, only
179.692 sheep and 9265 cattle were put
through last year; and the general decline in
the yardings hardly accounts for all this
shrinkage. The country producers of N. S.
Wales still have a lot to learn regarding the
benefits of co-operation.
The co., nevertheless, continues to improve
its financial position, thanks mainly, of
course, to the war price which the xAllied
Governments have been giving for Aus-
tralian wool. In 19.14-5 the co.’s gross earn-
ings were £29,721; for the past 12 months
£39,623. But the methods of the Wool Com-
mittee are so complicated that the selling
agent finds his expenses per bale a great deal
higher than they used to be. Also, owing to
delay in settlements, this co. had liabilities
totalling (apart from the mortgage) £155,783
on March 31 last, as against £18,011 in 1915.
Still this isn’t a matter of any consequence,
as £148,999 was owing by the Common-
wealth Government as agent for the British
Government. Besides accumulating in seven
years reserves of £9535. equal to 38 p.c. of
the paid capital, the co. has written £4000 off
premises. This and some of the visible re-
serves have been employed to reduce the
mortgage on the freehold stores; the plaster
has been shrunk from £21.000 in 1912 to
£16,000 at present. Practically, therefore,
assuming that the stores are worth what
they cost, the co. has, after wiping out pre-
liminary exes, and paying its dividends and
bonuses, accumulated an amount equal
to rather more than half its capital in seven
years.
* . * * *
Here’s an Australian now at Long Lake,
Alaska:—
I'm at the Kennecott-Bonanza copper-mine, situ-
ated at the end of a 195-mile railway, which runs in
from the coast at Cordova, on Prince William Sound.
Mine and rail are owned and operated by a syndi-
cate of New York capitalists, headed by J. P. Mor-
gan and the Guggenheim brothers. The ore is
shipped over the railway to Cordova, thence by
steamer to the smelter at Tacoma (Wash.), a
distance of approximately 1800 miles. It sounds a
long way, yet the cost of producing refined Copper is
less than 5 cents per lb.—say, £23 per ton—which
I think is the world’s record at present. The
reason is the high grade of the ore, chiefly copper
glance, covelite and bornite, worth at times from
60 p.c. to 78 p.c. copper. The freight rate on the
railway, which was completed in 1911, at a cost of
26,000,000 dollars, is 40 dollars a ton, and the
passenger rate is 124 cents per mile. The co. pro-
duced during 1917 an average of 6,000,0001b. copper
per month. The temperature drops to 60 degrees
below zero at times during the winter months, but
in spite of this and the heavy snowfalls, the co. has
been able to operate the line practically all the year
round. This is a very promising country for the pro-
spector ; but owing to high freight rates and cost
of living it is practically inaccessible to any but
people with capital. ■ Also the ground is covered
with snow about eight months in the year, which
helps to make prospecting expensive.
* *■ * *
“Rigger” : The development of the Papuan
oil-fields has become an evergreen subject in
the Federal Parliament. It appears that
work has been practically stopped for a year
because plant bought in U.S.A. was sent via
Sydney to Valaila without being examined
by a Government engineer. The plant was
evidently incomplete, because certain parts
were made in Sydney and not fitted to the
American portion until both lots reached the
oilfield. It is said that important pipes
could not be screwed together because the
American thread differed from the Austra-
lian. It is no use looking for somebody to
blame, because the history of petroleum
mining in Papua is a tale of muddling from
first to last. The oil is there all right, and
of a light-gravity type suitable in the first
instance for use as fuel oil. Yet after four
years Australia has not got an oil-field.
Glynn, the Minister for Papua, says “the
Government could not allow exploitation
such as some people desired.” Surely the
Minister is capable of protecting this coun-
try’s interests fully and carefully! Private
Enterprise wants to go in and get the oil
known to be there and needed very badly
by the public. Why not limit the period
of exploitation to 20 years, insist on buy-
ing all oil produced at market price, and
charge a royalty of 10 p.c. to the people
who ra ; se the petroleum? It seems too
absurd to talk of the difficulty of “bringing
in” a flowing oil-well because of the trouble
of setting and casing in volcanic mud. There
is scarcely an oil-well in Mexico, the greatest
oil country on earth to-day. that is not bored
through volcanic mud, and the Yankee oil
engineers laugh at the idea that mere shift-
ing mud cannot be overcome. Summarised,
the position is that Papua is as good an oil
territory as Borneo, that the Government
has made a shocking mess of this as of
everv other business, and that in order to
create a domestic oil-supply it ought to per-
mit Private Enterprise to search for oil
under proper safeguards.

ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
No notice (except of a hostile character ) will be
taken of communications insufficiently stamped,
Name and address must appear on the MSS. No
liability is undertaken re contributions volun-
tarily submitted; and no MS. will be returned
unless stamps accompany.
D.W.A.: Of course we will. She should
have got the allowance long ago. That’s the sort of
work which the Returned Soldiers’ societies ought to
specialise in, and tile whole country should know it.
If these bodies fought tooth and nail for the rights
of the men on service and their relatives during the
men’s absence, recruiting would be a lot easier
H.P.: All right. The rabbit-skins are hereby with-
drawn, and the confession made that the present'
Labor Mayor of Richmond doesn’t wear them....
A.H,: Forwarded as desired G.G.R.: Sorry can’t
acknowledge pars. As to their fate, if they are
printed they are accepted, and payment awaits the
writer; if they are not printed, they have fallen
into the abyss tforth-west: Glad to read pars.
from anyone, but have no space to acknowledge
them.... T. (W.A.): Thanks for clip; that ends it.
O.: You apparently had something to say; but
you can’t dash off paragraphs at a mile a minute for
this paper. Try again... .M.C,: He was never on
the staff of the paper, but like thousands of others
lie was a contributor, though an infrequent 0ne....
Frank Free: No; it doesn’t work... .E. 8.: “Mar-
tyred Martyr’’ won’t do. You don’t seem to know
the meaning of some of the words you u5e....D.D.:
Not for us. But you should be able to sell it else-
where. .. .E.W.: “Dinkum Recrooter” very crude....
L.T.: Horrible... .P. 0.0.: We don’t care for them.
A.A.M.M.: Nothing there at a 11.... J.A.W.:
Very commonplace old cove A.8.C.: The sonnet,
in that form, must not end with a couplet. •. •
G.M.D.: Verse too rugged; and Bullecourt isn’t in
Flanders Roo: Removed for sanitary reasons....
J.C.: “Million Dollar Girl” isn’t respectable
Cynicus: Same old idea S.C.: Not even “when
they come back” will they put up with a rhyme like
scorn “spawn.”... .E.W.: Not that way... .Mind
the Baby: “Typical Australian Home” brings us no
joy O.B.: “Our Soldier Boys” does the trick:—
Our boys are all so strong and bright,
To the front they know we have to go;
We’ll fight for our country, which is right,
Our dear mother land we will show.
They’re waiting for the boys from Australia’s land,
ihe boys they know which is fearless and bold:
lhey know we 11 conquer, and leave our brand •
ror ever and ever it will be told. ’
Now may they return with ringing cheers,
lo Australia s sunny and glorious land;
lo see the ones they loved so dear,
■ or ever may they hold each other’s hands.
....Praying One: Oh, change the brand... .P.W.:
‘Forbidden Fruits” is a bit unripe... .M.E.C.: Not
nearly up Kiwi: Poorly handled. For Heaven’s
sake, study the verb “to 1ie.”... .Larty Doh: Very
crude... .Figaro: Can’t find the humor in it....
, Not had, hut get a theme of your, own.
The chief merit of the other lay in its fresh idea. .
Pap: Wretched attempt... .X-Ray: Very far off still.
T.H.C.: One stanza:—
1 the white dove-wings of Peace
Wildly, wildly flutter—and fall.
I saw the War-bird, grim grey beast,
Brood over all.
. X.D.S.: N 0.... J.C.: It’s a whirling thing—and it
might be poetry if 'only some of the lines would
scan and some of the endings would rhyme.
Hannibal: Very weak “Sonnet.” Other verse thin!!!!
L.P.J.: Poor stuff... .U.K.: Dull verse with no
special beauty or force. Your sonnet form is .-bad.
.. ..M.A.: “Hardy Cracker” has too many useless
lines.. .A.G.: The “Lid” doesn’t anywhere near fit
Fanuela: The water-lily misses... .H.M.: “O’Reilly”
too bumpy Henrietta Maria: Why write it with
all that dull affectation? C.D.C.: Not up....
T.E.S.: Can’t understand a word of it... .M.I.W. •
The story shows promise E.H.H.: A nightmare of
misplaced stops and capital letters... .A.A.N.S.:
Doesn’t convince Abracadabra: No yarn there...
W.J.S.: It has to go back H.J.C.: The verse
doesn’t thrill u5.....J.W.R. Doesn’t make a story...
W.G.D.: Not force enough... .C.O’L.: Not up....
A.G.J.: One might do.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
G.F.H.: Beginner’s work. Memo forwarded
G. Too early M.H.: It won’t do rR.McA. :
Don’t want him H.L. J.: It’s all dull stuff
N. 8.: That jest can’t fly here... .M.F.G.: Ugly with-
out being funny W.J. J.: Dim pencil sketches and
the gag marked “original” is as old as original sin.
H. : Study perspective for a start... .R.E.8.:
They glimmer and there is no joy in them
L.U.T.: Has the Warwick egg only just hit your
imagination? Or is this a grandchild?
Frank Coffee writes to explain. In the
letter which he wrote to the Sydney Tele-
graph some months ago, and which The
Bulletin lately quoted as evidence that an
inquiry into the cost of the proposed wheat
elevators was necessary, there was an error.
He misread the report he received from the
engineer. The 3|-million-bushel elevators
he spoke of cost a million dollars; the one
at Vancouver with a capacity of 11 million
bushels cost $750,000.
Truly the Kaiser has an eye to the future.
In 1905 he presented an alleged gold cup,
said to be worth £lOOO, as a U.S. yachting
prize. It has now been melted down, and
proved to be mostly pewter and worth £7 in
all. So William bouvht £lOOO worth of
popularity from Uncle Sam, and saved £993,
with nine years’ compound interest, to help
pay for sinking Uncle Sam’s ships. The
Hohenzollerns started as money-lenders, by
the way. Brandenburg, the foundation of
their empire, came to them as a sort of for-
feited pledge.
The Mcßride case, S. Aus., has ended in
the High Court. Mcßride is a fine
old squatter, very generous to charities
and in general to his own family, and when
he went to law with his widowed daughter
over a piece of land, Judge Buchanan hinted
delicately that age (the old man is 87)
was all that was the matter with him.
Mcßride argued that he gave the daughter
merely, the use of the land; she said he had
given it her outright. The Supreme Court
found in her favor, but the persistent
father appealed, and the High Court has
decided that he has the right end of
the stick. What the Court thought of the
moral aspect can be guessed from the fact
that it refused him the costs, which must by
now be enormous, that would ordinarily go
with the judgment.

industry everywhere is becoming
keenly conscious of the economy of
the conveyor method of transporting
material.
The man-pushed wheelbarrow and
truck- and even horse haulage —are
proving too costly for short-distance
transport.
Goodyear Conveyor Belts show a far
lower transport cost per ton.
They are balanced belts.
The cover is tough and thick enough to with-
stand the abrasion of sharp and heavy materials.
The carcass is of especially woven duck, giving
maximum strength per unit of weight.
The belts are constructed so that unusual wear is
built into both carcass and cover with due regard
to the conditions under which the belt will be
used and the materials which it is to convey.
In few cases does the cover outlast the carcass or
vice versa.
If either were the case, the belt could not be an
economical one for you, because after one part
of a belt is worn out the other cannot continue
in service.
But in balanced belts such as the Goodyear the
two are accurately proportioned.
The construction experience that has made these
balanced Goodyear Conveyor Belts possible was
gained in building Goodyear Tyres.
The tread of a tyre corresponds to the conveyor cover,
its carcass to the body of the belt.
The same skill, superior materials and construction that
have made possible the mileage records of Goodyear
Tyres have made possible the low tonnage-cost records
of Goodyear Conveyors.

Eight Good Points about tbe
COLO TYRE.
(1) TEEAD.—Corrugated, presenting small surface to the road, thereby saving friction.
(2) TEEAD.—A great thickness of rubber, which is practically cut- and chip-proof.
(3 ) BREAK Kit STRIP, which, being made of loose! y-woven, heavy fabric, binds the
tread to the carcase of the tyre.
(4) PUEE EUBBEE. —Pure Eubber is placed under Breaker Strip.
(5) CAECASE.—Composed of five plies of heavy, long-fibre canvas, heavily impreg-
nated with rubber.
(6) FULL AIE SPACE.
(7) SIDE WALLS.—Eealising the severe work tyres are called upon to to do in the
country, we have placed a great thickness of rubber on the side walls, preventing
water from entering, as often happens in other makes of tyres after a few months'
service. Other makes have very little thickness of rubber at this point.
(8) BEADS are heavily reinforced and skin-coated with rubber, to prevent rust.

“Glengallan”: Australia’s old friend Hou-
dini, the handcuff expert, crops up in U.S.A.,
where he has been invited to teach the
Sammies some of his tricks. At the direction
of General Evan Johnson, Lieut. Hills, aide-
de-camp at Camp Upton, has asked the
magician for details of his offer to instruct
American soldiers and sailors how to escape
from prison manacles and torpedoed trans-
ports. Hoad ini has promised to reveal his
secrets to a class of 12, who can then put
others wise, until as escapers the U.S. army
and navy will have no living equals.
“Harrison O.”: Recently I thought I had
put forward an original idea in suggesting in
a Poverty Point par. that Alexander Watson
should recite the sixth chapter of the Book
of Job, but there is nothing new under the
limelight. American papers singe to hand
THE SHARPSHOOTERS.
“Awful, this war, isn’t it?”
“Horrible! A man can’t go to the pictures
note but he takes a risk of havin’ a
recruitin’ lecture fired at him.”
contain accounts of the production by Stuart
Walker, at the Booth Theatre, N’Yark, of a
dramatic version of the Biblical yarn. When
(he curtain rose two Narrators were re-
vealed in niches on either side of the stage,
which was kept dark until the verses dealing
with Job and Satan’s efforts to get bold of
him were ended. Then the hero took the
centre, supported by Eliphaz, Bildad and
Zophar, against a background depicting the
landscape of Uz. Job (George Gaul) sat
during most of his long speeches, but stood
up to the violent passages, and is said to
have caused a sensation by his passionate
delivery of the announcement: “I know that
my Redeemer liveth.” After the whirlwind
and storm a brilliant light was poured upon
the body of the prostrate hero, whilst the
Voice (which belonged to Australia’s esteemed
friend David Bispham) spoke its piece. The
Narrators recited the closing verses, dealing
with Job’s return to prosperity. Music was
used in moderation and incense burnt
throughout. There is no immediate prospect
o* the Firm or Bert Bailey going after the
Australian rights.
From a stage charmer of 25 years ago:—
In my young- play-acting days we wore tights and
were proclaimed “hussies” ; but oiir upper garments
were decent enough, and no girl would appear with-
out sleeves, though in a decolletage the sleeve was
merely a crescent to hide the armpit. Without being
a wowser I scarcely enjoyed the spectacle of bare
knees and thighs in the recent Williamson panto.
The unfortunate "girls were unable to “make up”
their legs with the sticky mixture known as “wet
white,” as they had a hurried change into tights
for another item, and the silk would not pull on
over the whitewash. The footlights are cruel, and
showed some knees red or else rough. A few brunettes
wanted depilating, and most of the legs looked
ridiculous nude, but excellent when cased in silken
hose. The bodices began late and ended early. This
necessitated the hideous shaven armpit-—a fashion
even copied by society dames. I predict a prickly
time for these young shavers later.
“0.K.” : The present generation knows not
“Called Back,” the novel of long ago which
produced a fortune for “Hugh Conway,” the
author, before it proved a little gold-mine
in its dramatised form. Australians of
older growth remember “Called Back” as
the drama wherein Kate Bishop (mother of
Marie Lohr) played the heroine, and George
Rignold had his great part of Macari, the
Italian spy. One is reminded of it by a
mention of the fact that Hugh Conway’s
three sons are prominent figures in the war.
The eldest is a general, the second son is
something short of an admiral, and the third
is one of the fleet-chaplains. The family
name is Fargus.-
“Fax”: Alexander Watson’s most intelli-
gent admirers are his warmest sympathisers.
Compare the life of Watson on tour with
that of the star actor who plays one charac-
ter for weeks at a stretch. He
changes liis programme every
night, and every day his brain is
at rehearsal. His waking hours
are mostly spent in recalling dif-
ferent lots of lines, each lot long
enough to last over two solid
hours of monologue. He has no
cues to prompt his memory, no
scenic items to remind him of his
words. An actor might say that
Watson has no stage business to
bear in mind, no deeds that he
must time to the tick. But a
mummer’s actions are no extra
strain on his memory, for he
mechanically identifies them with
certain words, or with certain
bursts of silence when they are
dumb show. The long run of a
piece is the star actor’s holiday.
No holidays for Watson, save on
a long sea voyage. Probably the
Shakspearean scenes are most
deeply bitten into his brain, be-
cause they required the deepest
study when he was learning them.
The late Alfred Dampier used to
interrupt his productions of lurid
melodrama with “Shakspearean
Fridays,” changing the play every
week. Walking to the theatre
on these poetic drama nights he
would quietly spout his lines for
Hamlet. Jaques or what not, and
say “Ah, one never forgets
Shakspeare!” When I men-
tioned this to another old actor as
evidence that Dampier had a “soul” he merely
remarked: “You don’t forget Shakspeare
because he is so blanky hard to memorise.”
This actor certainly had'no soul.
The Sydney soprano. Madeline Collins, has
won a prima donna’s billet with Thomas
Beecham in London, and is to voice a big
heartbreak in “Romeo and Juliet.”
Two old theatrical friends have a lot of
life in them still. One is Bert Gilbert, here
long ago with Ada Reeve on her first, or
“French Maid,” visit to Australia. He
lately played the lead at the Islington Em-
pire, London, in a musical farce produced by
himself, and of Avhicli he is also author and
in part composer. The other relic is “La
Poupee.” It still runs on tour in England,
and the “rights” are valuable enough to be
the subject of a lawsuit, the holder of them
being an enemy subject and not now on hand
to be dealt with.
“THE THREE TWINS,” AT SYDNEY
MAJESTY’S.
Dyspeptic General Field Fisher expresses
his opinion of Ned Mayland (Fred
Maguire) as a suitor for his ward.
“Cobber” : Electric corridor box-plans are
the latest innovation at the picture shows.in
Hobart. Each chair is represented by a
miniature electric-light which automatically
switches on when the seat is occupied. In-
tending patrons can thus see prior to enter-
ing the theatre exactly what places are
available.
The yarn of- an old Pointer:—
1 never see anyone else on the stage. I know they
are there by a sort of instinct. I do not even hear
them as you would hear a conversation in your
drawing-room. I know what they are saying, but
I'm hanged if I know how I know. It is certainly
not by hearing them in the ordinary sense. And I
see nobody. Even the enraptured heroine I am
holding in rny arms is not consciously visible to me.
I kiss her, and rarely miss the spot, but by what
process I score the hit I cannot understand, let
alone explain. I remember hearing George Rignold
say something to the same effect. “When I am on
the stage, in point of fact, I do not actually see
anybody else on the stage. But, then,” added
George, “neither does the audience i”
Wallace Brotvnlow is again uplifting in
public what remains of the voice in which he
poured out his passion for Nellie Stewart in
“Ma Mie Rosette.” He has been engaged by
the Fullers, and made a start at Brisbane,
winning the approval of Billo and Doreen
for the Pagliacci prologue and other ditties.
' “0.K.”: Robert Courtneidge years ago
remarked on the versatility and adroitness
of Australian stage-hands as compared with
the British sort, and now it seems that in
wheeling the folding sets of “The Masquer-
into position they have licked the best
American endeavor. This energy behind the
scenes is exciting to the audience that sits
in darkness whilst the work is going on.
The people can’t see the performance of
the miracle changes, but they can hear ’em.
There’s plenty of sound of scenery in motion
whilst the London Fog is giving place to
Chilcote’s drawing-room, or the drawing-
room is being wheeled aside to make space
for Loder’s lodgings, or vice versa. These
happenings in the darkness, averaging less
than 40 seconds each, are features of the
entertainment. Also they are strenuous
times for Post. He is one man in one cos-
tume when darkness falls on the stage, and
the other fellow in another costume when
the light is turned up again. With the aid
of a darkie dresser he accomplishes what
would be called “feats of protean art” in a
vaudeville show. In fact. Post shares in
the glory of a record-breaking interval be-
tween _ lights dd\vn and lights up. seeing that
the slightest hitch in the adjustment of his
garments means a delay in lighting up. He
is jumping out of one suit of clothes and
into another whilst the floor is moving under
him. Melbourne audiences were the more
appreciative of these lightning-change effects
because they had been chafing under a series
of dreary, time-wasting intervals in drama
played elsewhere.
“0.”: Turner, the old d.c. doorkeeper at
Her Maj.’s (Melb.), is a sick man nowadays,
paralysed on one side. Thirty years “on the
doors” at the Princess’s and Her Majesty’s
has made him a theatrical identity, just as
long service in a similar capacity at Fleming-
ton and Caulfield has familiarised him to
racegoers. The old boy is not only a store-
house of good stories, but a model of tact
and discretion.
“Yatep” : Belle Sylvia, a plump lady baritom*
singer on the Fuller circuit, got out on the
warpath in Brisbane recently, singing, recit-
ing and orating. In six days she persuaded
20 eligibles into khaki.
“B.”: The two Bluegums were cracking
hardy in the gallery. Mabelle Morgan was
the study. “Cripes,” says No. 1 Gum,. “I’d
like to crack the cow who’s flashin' the
lookin‘-glass on her face.”
“Melb”: Graham Browne does notable act-
ing in “General Post” at Melb. Royal. The
Bancrofts, in their ever-interesting autobi-
ography, mention that Browne was among
the pupils of manager Benson, in his valu-
able performances of Shakspeare in England.
Others were Asche, Lily Brayton, Ainley and
Matheson Lang.

Simple and Effective .Methods.
By Olga Amsdell, Special Correspondent,
London, Eng.
Why Have Grey Hair?
Few people know that grey hair is not a
necessary feature of age—that it can be
avoided without resorting to hair dyes. A
very old, home-made remedy will turn the
hair back to a natural color in a few days.
It is only necessary to get from the chemist
two ounces of concentrate of tammalite and
mix it with three ounces of bay rum. Apply
this simple lotion to the hair for a few nights
with a small sponge and you will soon have
the pleasure of seeing the greyness disappear.
This recipe is perfectly harmless, is neither
sticky nor greasy and has given perfect satis-
faction for many generations to those in
possession of the secret.
Blackheads,. Oily Pores, etc.
The new sparkling face-bath treatment rids
the skin of blackheads, oiliness and enlarged
pores almost instantly. It is perfectly harm-
less, pleasant and immediately effective. All
you have to do is to drop a sty mol tablet,
obtained from the chemist, in a glass of hot
water, and after the resulting effervescence
lias subsided dab the affected portions of the
face freely with the liquid. When you dry
the face you will find that the blackheads
come right off on the towel, the large pores
contract and efface themselves and the greasi-
ness is all gone, leaving the skin smooth, soft
and cool. This treatment should be repeated
a few times at intervals of several davs in
order to make sure that the result slnill be
permanent.
The Magnetism of Beautiful Hair.
Beautiful hair adds immensely to the per-
sonal magnetism of both men and women.
Actresses and smart women are ever on the
look out for any harmless thing that will in-
crease the natural beauty of their hair. The
latest method is to use pure stallax as a sham-
poo on account of the peculiar glossy, fluffy
and wavy effect which it leaves. As stallax
has never been used much for this purpose it
comes to the chemist only in ilb. sealed origi-
nal packages, enough for 25 or 30 shampoos.
A teaspoonful of the fragrant stallax gran-
ules. dissolved in a cup of hot water, is more
than sufficient for each shampoo. It is very
beneficial and stimulating to the hair apart
from its beautifying effect.
How to Remove a Bad Complexion.
Cosmetics can never really help a poor com-
plexion; often they are positively harmful,
the sensible, rational way is to actually re-
move the thin veil of stifling, half-dead scarf-
skin from the face, and give the fresh, vigor-
ous and beautiful young skin underneath a
chance to show itself and to breathe.
This is best done in a very simple way, by
merely applying mercolised wax at night, like
cold cream, and washing it off in the morning.
Cood npercolized wax can be obtained from
any well-stocked chemist. It absorbs the dis-
figuring cuticle gradually and harmlessly,
leaving a brilliant natural complexion. Of
course, this also takes with it all such facial
blemises as red blotches, tan, moth patches
sallowness, liver spots, pimples, etc. As a
freckle remover and general complexion beau-
tifier this old-fashioned remedv is unequalled.
The Powder Puff Passes.
Every normal woman is always interested
111 any plan by which she can quickly enhance
her beauty, provided the plan is perfectly safe
and simple. Ever since the discovery that
ordinary cleminite, such as any chemist can
supply, is an instantaneous and harmless
beautifler, there has been- a growing demand
for it from smart women everywhere. They
usually get about an ounce and add just
enough water to dissolve it. A little of this
perfectly harmless lotion gives a beautiful
complexion to any face instantly. It renders
face powder quite unnecessary. Moreover, its
use cannot be detected. The skin is instantly
beautified but appears perfectly natural
under the closest scrutiny. [3

IMPORTANT.—LOOK TO YOUR TEETH.
There are no teeth like those furnished by Nature. For service, comfort and good
health, artificial teeth cannot be compared with a natural set.
Sensible people will accordingly try to preserve their teeth as long as possible by
keeping them clean. Cold water and soap and water are useful, but somewhat
ineffectual. Rough powders, such as cuttlefish, crabseyes, crude chalks and charcoal
are too severe on the enamel. '
EUDENTA TOOTH PASTE is scientifically prepared to clean the teeth, sweeten
the breath, harden the gums and disinfect the mouth (thus preventing decay).
EUDENTA is therefore regarded as “the perfection of dental luxuries.” 1/- tube every-

From Petrograd:—
The food situation in Russia has some interesting
features. While Petrograd is reduced to a daily
half-pound of alleged bread per mouth, and milk in
some quarters is unprocurable, the interior has an
exportable surplus which could relieve the awful
shortage in the big cities. Two factors, however,
operate against the cities getting a square meal. The
first is the railway disorganisation caused by the
promiscuous Bolsheviction of competent officers of
cadet or bourgeois sympathies, and deepened by the
new popular habit of annexing a train, as one
might a wheelbarrow. The second reason—and it is
vastly more important—is that the moujiks will not
sell their stocks of corn. They are partly animated
by a desire to injure the proletariat who produced
the present chaos, but their main fear is that they
will accumulate useless coin. It must be remem-;
bered that the peasantry became enriched during the
Czar’s reign by the allotments received from their
sons in the trenches; and as the few simple things
they desire are practically unobtainable, they see no
use in storing further riches on earth. One cannot
suggest to the moujik that the cash might be useful
for the future, because he would consider that reason-
ing silly. Not one in a thousand has imagination:
despite the fine work of the Zemstvos, or local coun-
cils, the bulk of the moujiks live only for the
moment—especially if there’s vodka in it.
“Burrundie : Two Territory identities went
west lately, and the rank-and-file turned out
to see them home. Arrived at the hospital,
which is also the town mortuary of Darwin,
it was found that two coffins couldn’t be
accommodated in the old cart which does
duty as hearse, so there was a procession to
the cemetery, a burial and another return,
half the mourners waiting at the graveside
while the other half returned to the hospital.
It being the wet season, the graves were
nearly full of w r ater despite desperate bailing
with one bucket. As each coffin was lowered
a battle began between the water and the
gravediggers. Eventually more holes were
bored in the coffins, and after much turning-
turtle and . poling, they sank to rest. Next
day a Government official was buried; but
this time a neat hand-pump was provided to
unwater the grave.
“Timber” has a cut:—
The troubles of the timber-millers in N. S. Wales
are trifling compared with those in Bananaland.
Royalties by the Crown are as high as 6s. 6d. per

manded by N.S.W'. Such high prices are ruling
because of bad administration on the part of the
Forests Department and manosuvring on the part of
a strong syndicate. The log pine trade is cornered
and the syndicate referred to is forcing up prices
beyond reason. It holds freehold timber country
that will not be cut out for the next 15 years, and
the Forests Department is playing into its hands.
The mills are hungering for supplies, yet are com-
pelled to work short time. The Administration,
meanwhile, allows the log trade to be cornered for
the benefit of one concern, which is making thousands
by exporting, whilst there is an embargo on Crown
timbers being sent out of the State. It would be
much better for the public if lower royalties were
fixed and shipment of logs from the State prevented,
whether from freehold or Crown lands, thus giving
more work and providing cheaper houses.
“Private Room”: The examination of vol-
unteers at the depots is too perfunctory. Two
good mates decided to enlist together, so
they went along to a metropolitan depdt and
w r ere both O.K.’d by the doctor there. Happy
in the knowledge that they would be able to
stick together, they went out to Broad-
meadows at the appointed time. At the
examination before inoculation, one was
passed and the other turned down because
of a weak heart. Not content with this, the
reject asked to be sent before the Board.
Verdict: “Won’t have you at any price!”
Still persisting hopefully, he was sent to the
highest authority. Final verdict: “You’d
crack up in a fortnight.” Now, why couldn’t
the depot doctor have told him that before
he threw up his job and divided his civi.
effects? This sort of thing certainly inflates
the recruiting figures in one way; but it
also adds to the number of men with just
grievances, and that had more to do with
killing Conscription than anything else, and
is quite as bad a stumbling-block in the way
of voluntary enlistment.
A Victorian boy tells how the Emir of
Kano took delivery of his C.M.G.: —
For a week before ■ the event great preparations
were made on the racecourse, and the Emirs of the
nine other divisions were asked to attend. On the
evening before the Day they had all arrived, with
their many thousands of followers. On the morning
the whole place was astir with horsemen, and the
old town, which is inside the walls, was soon
shrouded in dust.
The sight from the racecourse stand, was unfor-
gettable. Any 20,000 horsemen congregated in a
small place make a fine sight; but when they are in
gorgeously-colored robes and carry shining spears and
shields, the effect is wonderful. They presented
themselves as a formidable ally, these Hausa chiefs,
with their thousands of well-mounted followers.
Governor-General Lugard must have felt a proud
man as he surveyed the host that stood ready to
march past and salute him; for it was he who first
fought through and opened up this country not 16
years ago; and the Emir upon whom he was con-
ferring honor that day was one of his old foes.
During the march weird music was produced by
instruments carried by the horsemen. Such a row I
had never before heard. It appeared that the im-
pression of the followers was the more noise they
could make, the higher would their particular seriki
(king) be held in esteem by the seriki white man.
Some few of the warriors wore the chain armor of
the Crusades, brought to Kano centuries ago by the
caravans of the great desert.
The Emir of Kano possesses a jester, and it was
this man’s job to ride up and down in front of the
stand and announce the different serikis as they
passed. He was dressed in rags and had as many
tricks and grimaces as Chaplin.
The next part of the programme was the Hausa
salute, which consists of a 400-yard charge at full
gallop straight at the saluting base. When the
thousand horsemen are almost upon you the seriki
puts up his hand, and the troop stops dead. That
seriki having saluted, he and his followers turn to
the side to dismount and watch the other Emirs do
their bit. The sudden halt is done with a most
severe and cruel bit, which would stop an elephant
at the gallop ; the part in the bit comes to a point
and is about three inches long. In consequence of
this sudden pulling up, most of the horses in this
country are cow-hocked.

What is Neurasthenia?
Neurasthenia is the medical term applied
to the condition of nervous exhaustion that
is very common in modern ife. The patient
does not appear to have any definite disease,
but becomes incapable of sustained exertion.
Sometimes the sufferer is subject to hysteria.
If the patient can get away to the country
or seaside and forget all cares and worry it
will help greatly towards a cure. It will
also be necessary to take a reliable tonic—
such a one as Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills for
instance. These pills stimulate the appetite
and assist in the nutrition of the nerve cells.
As the nerves get their nourishment from
the blood the treatment must be directed
towards building up the blood. Dr. Williams’
Pink Pills act directly on the blood, and with
proper regulation of the diet have proved of
the greatest benefit, in many cases of neuras-
thenia. A tendency to anaemia, or biood-
lessness, shown by most neurasthenic
patients, is also corrected by these tonic
pills. Your own dealer sells Dr. Williams’
Pink Pills. Price 2s. 9d. per box, six boxes
15s. 3d.
Further information on the tonic treat-
ment of “Diseases of the Nervous System”
is contained in a useful booklet which will
be sent free to any applicant by the Dr.
Williams’ Medicine Co., Box 594 G.P.0.,

Walter C. Brown, 37, late of the Northern
Territory, literally humped his swag 400
miles to get into khaki. He hoisted himself
and his burden on the excrescence of a camel
and travelled to Oodnadatta, thence by rail
to Melbourne, where he was sworn in a
week or two ago.
Jude, of the Vic. Miuing Employees’ Asso-
ciation, has been appointed secretary-rep. of
the new miners’ division of the A.W.U. It
means, of course, that he has got up, turned
round and sat down again. But it also
means that there will be more power behind
his punch—for good or otherwise.
Major L. F. Giblin, the only member of
the Speck’s Parliament to get into khaki so
far, has just scored a D.S.O. The Bul-
letin, knowing something of the very un-
usual Giblin, doesn’t doubt that lie won it
a time or two before he got it.
Sydney Water Police Court, which, as a
measure of economy, is to close at the end
of June, was established in 1850. It sat first
on the western side of Circular Quay, on
the corner of Argyle-street, but after a few
years shifted into a stone, building facing
Albert-street, and now used as the Charge
Court. The first presiding magistrate was
Henry 11. Browne.
Two .chaplains recently paragraphed in
The Bulletin —W. F. Dexter, D. 5.0., “the
Pinching Parson,” and F. W. Holland, “the
Cocoa King”—are down for Military
•Crosses. Dexter is an Anglican of 45, and
Holland a Presbyterian of 38. They are not
a bit like the padre who returned a while
ago on a crowded trooper and was counted
out by the boys because he had neglected his
job among them on the voyage.
“Melb”: Recurring to G.-G. Ferguson’s
bandaged head, through one of Von Mueller’s
pine trees falling upon him, after chopping
a la Gladstone. About half a century ago,
before Government House was thought of,
Von Mueller planted 19,000 little pines on
the hill and showed the reporters of the
Melbourne newspapers around saying: “This
will be a glorious forest in the next genera-
tion. The lovers will come here and thank
me.” Alas! the hill only grows imported
cocked hats—one at a time.
Sunday picture-shows are unknown in
Adelaide, but Port Pirie is kicking against
the recent closing of them there by the Chief
Sec. The Council of Churches got the job
done, and the Town Council says it should
have been consulted first. The chairman of
the local Liberty League told an indignation
meeting that the population had to roam the
streets, or gamble, if the movie is denied
them. “I have daughters, and while they
are at the pictures I know they are tolerably
safe; but, if there were no pictures, God
only knows what might become of them.”
Sunday pictures to buttress the Sanctity of
the Home —this is a new idea. And probably
a reasonable one. If Melbourne and Sydney
had as few social advantages and comforts
as Pt. Pirie, they would want the pubs kept
open, too.
“Seancer’s” memories of a prophetess:—
I never knew that Mrs. Rising, the late Queen of
the Melbourne clairvoyants, was a Scotchwoman until
the fact was mentioned in The Bulletin. It explains
how hard-headed David Syme came to take his fellow-
countrywoman seriously, after Alfred Deakin had
introduced him to the mystic circle. An English-
woman wouldn’t have got a hearing from David under
the same pretensions. Unbelievers who had tested
Mrs. Rising’s clairvoyanev in her younger days, and
had found her wanting, were amazed to hear of the
old man being one of hdr patrons when she was past
her prime. The grim lord of the Ace had his doots
about Mrs. Rising, of course; nevertheless he must
have paid her a lot of money for spiritual diagnosis
and advice. The late Windsor, his long-time editor,
used to say that the boss would give half his for-
tune to be convinced of the genuineness of medium-
istic claims. He wanted badly to be a sincere
believer, but his* hard connnonsense kept him back.
He certainly could have obtained convincing evidence
of Mrs. Rising’s frauduleney from many witnesses.
When traps were laid for her she fell in, maunder-
ing of dead husbands to women who had never been
married, and giving' messages from dead children to
childless Wives. When her disgusted' clients called
her an impostor she broke out into abuse and raved
about her influential supporters. Threatened with
exposure she would talk of the members of Parliament
and lights' of sassiety who would /ally to her call.
During her long life at the game she acquired a
■great mass of information about all sorts and condi-
tions of people, so she was full of tips concerning her
new customers before she took them in hand.
“Chink”: It will probably soothe “Gal-
lery Hand” (B. 23/5/’18) to know that
we in Bananaland have duly marked his
observations aneut the “provincial” nature
of Brisbane newspaper methods ; but it has
to be said that our sincerest feeling in the
matter is one of grief to find that- anyone
claiming kinship with the Inky Way could
exhibit such amiable stupidity. If our
brother of the Gallery had sufficient jour-
nalistic savvy to rise above notetaking, he
might learn that a report of a meeting can
be faithful and bright at the same time, and
that brightness does not necessarily mean
“smart” writing. The sneer at the proposal
that Premier Ryan should roll up 1000 men
for the Front, which he weeps over as
“guff,” was a fair report of an important
meeting. The announcement of-the project
was forecasted by Recruiting-Minister
Orchard as something that would “send a
thrill throughout Australia,” and any press-
man who neglected to w T rite up how that
announcement was received by several
thousand people would be well rewarded by
the order of the bag. In any case, the brick
of “provincialism” is a dangerous weapon for
Melbourne or Sydney pressmen to handle.
The little-Australian views of the news-
papers of these cities are notorious. Bris-
bane papers do not sacrifice matters of
national interest to local events, but they
manage, with a vastly greater area to cover
than their southern affinities, to pay decent
attention to the interests of the State of
Queensland. Contrariwise, I wot of several
instances in Victoria where country local-
bodies have had to appeal to the Argus and
Age for better treatment. And if “Gallery
Hand” or any other scribbler of these pride-
stuffed cities wants further enlightenment
on the point, I swear that The Bulletin
could tell ’em something interesting, particu-
larly in regard to the once-proposed Austra-
lian capital at Dalgety.


Edison BlueAmberol
Records for June
m
The June list contains an unusually comprehensive
variety of vocal and instrumental music, and it is specially
notable for its richness in fine numbers rendered by
famous Edison artists.
The Concert Records are a special treat. The “Serenade”
violin solo, by Mary Zentay (accompanied by Milan
Smolen), is exquisitely sympathetic, and “Home, Sweet
Home,” by Anna Case, is a revelation of tenderness.
All in the regular list are well up to Edison standard.
The dance music—including the three records of the
Lancers(Garde Republicaine [French] Band) and several
others —should be most popular at this season. “It’s a
Long, Long Time Since I’ve Been Home,” by Billy
Murray ; “Why I Love Him,” by Robert Clark; and “It’s
Time for Every Boy to be a Soldier,” sung by Gladys
Rice and chorus, lead the vocal items.-

A Few Bars of Australia’s Greatest
National Song', Written and Signed
by tbe Composer.
Mr. Marsh Little’s famous song, “Boys of the Dardanelles,” is known to everyone. On Anzac
Day it was played by every band in the historic procession, and the soldiers marched into the
Lord Mayor’s Luncheon at the Town Hall, Sydney, to its stirring tune. Nearly 100,000 copies of
“Boys of the Dardanelles” have been sold, easily an Australian song record.
In addition to Mr. Little’s wonderful gift as a Composer, he is regarded as one of Australia’s
most popular singers. He was born at Mud gee, N.S.W., and, wishing to benefit the many Australians
who appreciate his work, he writes to us the following valued letter.—
“It may interest yon to hear that I regard your New Discovery as being a great
asset to singers and elocutionists. When appearing at the Opera House, Auckland,
N.Z., on the Fuller Vaudeville Circuit, I was so indisposed through a severe relaxed
sore throat that I thought I should have to step out of the hill. I could only deliver
my songs (in a song scena) in whispers. . The stage-manager advised me try New
Discovery. I did, and the result was magical—my voice was quickly restored, and
I’ve been singing the praises of Dr. Sheldon’s New Discovery ever since.
“I am, cordially yours, “(Sgd.) MARSH LiITTIiE.”
Stops Coughs Banishes Colds.
When the cold winds blow and the Winter rain falls, then look out for Coughs and Colds.
Then is the time to put Dr. Sheldon’s New Discovery on the shelf where all the family can
quickly find it when they wish. Dose a cold with Dr. Sheldon’s New Discovery and the battle’s
won. Don’t let Influenza get you. Dr. Sheldon’s New Discovery will keep it away. Stop that
Cough. Dr. Sheldon’s New Discovery will do it, and give you a chance to sleep at night.
Winter weather is best for our health if we only take care of ourselves and keep coughs and
colds and kindred ailments at bay with DR. SHELDON’S NEW DISCOVERY. Price 1/6 and 3/-

Trentham—Morning.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
OH, Trentham morns are misty morns;
but where the vapor thins
The hills stride in like cavaliers
with ruffle at their chins;
Throwing aside their sombre cloaks within
Night’s dolorous halls
They bend to list the tones of day—the
sweet thin bugle-calls ;
The tunes among the gleaming reeds, the
harps among the trees,
And all the musicale of mirth that peals
around their knees.
Pale scax-ves of tulle and gossamer which
twine the crouching huts,
Bwung by the kirtle of the breeze across the
rifle-butts;
Dim echoes mazed amid the mist, and little
rosy cries
Which flutter through the. atmosphere like
- scarlet butterflies ;
And rounded sounds which march across
and up the valley-zones.
Grey as the grey roofs of the huts and cool,
grey cobble-stones;
Yet shining through the folded mist I sense
the nobler part,
And hear the heart-beat of the world and
match it with my heart.
Front-faced toward the broader life and kin
to stalwart things,
The full strong torrent of the Soul bears
rich imaginings,
Flowing across the plains of Life in one
brave cataract
Washing the dross of Dream and Sham from
off the gold of Fact;
The garment of Hypocrisy, the customs man
has framed,
Fall from the naked Being, and leave it
unashamed:
For I have seen the light of Truth which
passes all surmise,
Strong on the faces of strong men and shin-
ing from strong eyes.
The paths upon the Trentham heights are
very thin and brown ;
Behind the trees, before the trees, they
loiter up and down;
Yet ever to the upmost place beyond the
dreaming wood,
They seek the reeling skyline as a strong
man seeks the Good ;
Yet bi’owner than the Trentham paths that
gird the mountain rocks,
The nut-brown fingers hotly grip the dull-
brown rifle-stocks;
And brighter than the morning star which
droops beyond the glade,
The steel-white sky is echoed from a bur-
nished bayonet blade.
Chiming upon the charmed sight a blue
mantilla slips
Softly between the clouds that lie like
wind-tossed ostrich-tips;
And Trentham Morning puts a bronzed
bugle to her mouth,
And from the east the shrill, high light goes
echoing north and south ;
The tall trees shout, the cascades sing, the
taut reeds wail and hum,
And galloping among the dew, the rowdy
day-winds, come;
While swiftly on the topmost heights the
flags of fog are furled—
The sun leaps forth like gunfire and roars
across the world!

When This Wonderful War
Is Over.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
WHEN it is over, and people have
time to consider the old things
that it resurrected with improve-
ments, and the new things that it produced,
and the newer things that it hasn’t produced
yet but may before the finish, they will vote
it an amazing war. This is quite apart
from the butchery, and the hypocrisy, and
the shifting of boundaries, and the Hun
habit of being a wild beast running amok,
and the making of a new hell upon earth,
and the making of a new god whose name is
William, and the creation of new ideas as
to the possibilities of running into debt, and
things like these.
The new and incredible gun which shoots
a distance of 75 miles is an item. It may
not be much in itself, but it is the beginning
of something. One reason why it shoots so
far is that the shot flies high, and gets - into
a rarefied atmosphere where friction is
greatly diminished. If it flew higher, fric-
tion would presumably be further diminished,
also the drag of the earth’s attraction would
be reduced. Then it would naturally go
farther. - Supposing it went so high that it
did part of its journey where there was no
appreciable air at all and the pull of gravi-
tation was cut down another 25 or 50 or 90
per cent., it might perhaps stay up for a
quarter of a day, and see the earth slipping
away beneath its feet, and fall at last on
Chicago or Tobolsk. Of course if it stayed
up a whole day it would end by falling, in an
exhausted condition, after a journey round
the world, on the people who discharged it,
which is a thing to be avoided. And if it
flew much higher than that it would prob-
ably become a planet and not strike any-
thing. If the owners of the biggest possible
gun didn’t realise for a month or so that
they were only making planets they would
naturally be wild.
So far as it has gone the new gun sug-
gests that the existing ideas about the
security of islands as against purely land
Powers may have to be revised.
The return of the bow, or rather the cross-
bow, begins to look possible. There is a
demand for a weapon of almost unlimited
range which will be cheaper than the almost
unlimited gun, and quieter, and more port-
able. The bow went out because it was the
last effort of the human muscle as a propel-
ler of missiles, and the original seed mus-
ket and cannon (the “crakys of war,” as the
baby cannon bound with hoops was called at
the time when it burst and blew up a Scot-
tish king) came in because they were the
beginning of pure science. The older weapon,
which had superseded the half-brick and the,
sling and the javelin, might have kept its
place if science had been applied to it. _ A
crossbow of any size you like to mention,
manipulated by enough wind or water power,
or by a sufficiently big forest-devil —the
machine which hauls down trees —with
plenty of slaves or horses at the handle
would carry a bolt of any dimensions any
distance, and .if the bolt was a tank full of
the strongest explosives it would make a
noise wiien it arrived even if it departed
silently.
The Greek fire—a flaming legend shot
through a tube —has come into its own
again. It hasn’t made so much progress as
some of the old inventions which have come
back, but then it has been lying on the shelf
for many years while other devices were
being steadily improved. It is a resnectable
institution which soothed the bedside of a
dying empire hundreds of years ago and kept
tottering Greece on its feet long after it
should have been dead by all the rules of the
game. Over and over again the Greek, when
all seemed lost, breathed this valuable trade
secret in the eye of the enemy’s fleet, and
the enemy fled, blazing and discouraged.
When the flying fire acquires a longer range
it will be a mighty business. And the Chi-
nese stinkpot has awakened again on a scale
that the most earnest Chinese stinker never
imagined. The old pot possibly had its
beginnings in the habit of throwing dead
bodies into the enemy’s well. Then the cata-
pult (which should have had a place in the
bow and arrow and early-cannon paragraph)
was used to fling decomposed horses and
such-like over the wall into the hostile town
in the hope of creating disease, and the hos-
tile town naturally flung the dreadful thing
back. Sometimes the animal spent quite a
lot of its time in the air. Whether the
radiance of phosphorescent horse flying at
night was in any way a forerunner of the
searchlight and the star-shell is at present
unknown.
The habit of throwing the late lamented
animal back and forward was a branch of
the great military art of recrimination. This
was practised in very early times, when a
champion would stalk in front of his army,
telling the opposite champion that his mother
wasn’t properly married. It is a long road
from the barbarian who told the other bar-
barian that his name was Mud to the Hun
gas apparatus, but the road is plain.
Probably, however, the modern airship is
the greatest development of the war. It was
only yesterday when the first air-Columbus
flew the Straits of Dover and the first air-
Hannibal did the bird act over the Alps only
to break his neck in Lombardy. Now Lon-
don is bombarded by sky vessels three times
a week. For the last four years the invent-
ors of clippers of the clouds haven’t had to
hunt for patrons and capitalists. The patron
and the capitalist have been waiting for them
with money and encouragement and decora-
tions. The clipper of the clouds has grown
out of all knowledge in speed, size, cheap-
ness. and weight-carrying capacity. Above
all. it has increased out of all knowledge in
safety. It only falls when an enemy shoots
it. It is safer than old-horse Dobbin on a
quiet highway, and it beats the mule for
sure-footedness. Experts hold, in all seri-
ousness, that when the war is over, and
there is time to build airships for mercantile
purposes and there are civilised places where
they can fly without having guns fired at
them, they will take up the job of common
carriers—yachts and liners and cargo drud-
ges of the places between earth and heaven.
Then the train will presently get the sack,
and the steamer will get the run, and other
vehicles, except for short distances or back-
lane work, will get the grand bounce. Also
Australia’s great ravenous, foolish, corrupt,
permanent and unproductive debt will be
called Slush.
For the airship requires no hideously ex-
pensive permanent way, with its bridges,
viaducts, tunnels, cuttings and embank-
ments. Its road requires no repairs. If
things aren’t paying for axle-grease in one
direction it gathers up its line under its arm
and goes elsewhere. It can lay its new
transcontinental route or tear up its old one
at a minute’s notice. It is a steamer to which
deeps and shallows and sand-bars are all
one, and the sea it travels requires no dredg-
ing. Being both things in one it doesn’t
tranship its goods when it changes from the
land to the ocean, or when it strikes a bor-
der where some fool or freak has ‘arranged
a break of gauge. It is the embodiment of
economy, velocity, philosophy and blank in-
difference to circumstances, and it is the
short cut incarnate. It is coining, and the
old machines are going, like superannuated
gods blown before a high wind.
And when the air-liner and the air-tramp
are really here Prime Minister Hughes will
assuredly appoint a Royal Commission of
many expensive persons to inquire (1) if we
have air in Australia; (2) if it is the same
kind of air as in other places; (3) if dis-
tances are the same here as similar distances
in other places; (4) if the ground is hard to
fall upon should the machine drop from a
height of say a mile; (5) how high the
average passenger would bounce after a drop
of that size;, and (6) the general moral,
spiritual, political, botanical, mineral, pas-
toral and horticultural aspects of the enter-
prise and its probable climatic or other in-
fluences.
The submarine has increased and ex-
panded and improved in every way, but it
can’t be said to have shed much new light
on itself except as a sneaking implement of
destruction and a wet subterfuge. It may
have a great future as a fisherman, a hunter
for lost treasure, or even as a digger for
gold, coal, silver, copper, gems, etc., at the
sea-bottom, but these matters are uncertain
Still the possibilities of the submarine as
the sinker of deep mines make a fascinating
vision. All the mineral fields on earth
wouldn’t equal in size and potential riches
the claim it could peg out, especially with a
mechanical octopus to assist it—or a num-
ber of the creature. And in addition to its
usefulness the petrol-driven octopus would
bo company, down among the dead whales’
tombs. It is a poor squid that never re-
joices, especially when the reef is going Iooz
to the ton.

WHERE THE DANGER LIES.
Many People Suffer from Kidney Disease, but do not know it. That’s the danger.
The reason Kidnev D isease
-
is so generally fatal is that it
comes on unnoticed and
often gains a firm hold on
the sufferer before he knows
what is wrong with him.
Doan’s Backache Kidney
Pills should be used imme-
diately there is any such sign
of kidney disease as Back-
ache, Dizzy Spells, Water
Troubles, Gravel, Rheumatic
Pains, Heart Irregularity,
Sleeplessness, Irritability,
Watery Swellings in the
j o
Ankles or Beneath the Eyes,
Lumbago. Doan’s Backache
Kidnev Pills cleanse the
j
kidneys and assist them in
their great work of filtering
o o
the blood.
“Every Picture Tells a Story."
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills are sold at 2/9 per
bottle at all Chemists and Stores, or from Foster-
McClellan Co., 76 Pitt Street, Sydney.
Cured to Stay Cured.
SYDNEY TESTIMONY.
FROM BOTANY.
Mr. Lewis Williams. 602 Botany Road, Botany,
Sydney, .says“l was a great sufferer with my back,
and the pain was at times so bad that I have had to
leave my work and go home. I also had to walk about
in a bent position, and I could not straighten without
increased suffering. I used various preparations, but
only got slight temporary relief. Reading of cures
effected by Doan's Backache Kidney Fills, I decided
to try them. One bottle eased the pain, and the second
completed my cure. This did not happen yesterday,
but about seven years ago. and I have had no sign of
backache all that time, so it is not mere temporary
relief but a perfect cure. I am always advising my
friends to use Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, and
take this opporunity to publicly recommend them.”
Seven years later Mrs. Williams says:—“My hus-
band is still well, and has been free of backache since
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills cured him fourteen
years ago.”
FROM WAVERLEY.
Mrs. J. Maxwell, 23 Mackenzie Street, Waverley,
Sydney, says“lt gives me great pleasure to say a
few words in favor of Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills,
this remedy having completely cured me of a bad
attack of kidney disorder some two years ago. I suf-
fered dreadfully for some time, and was often so bad
with backache that I was obliged to lay up. I could
get no rest from the constant pain day or night, and it
was fast taking the life and energy out of me. The
kidney secretions were affected, being thick and cloudy,
with a red sediment, and there was puffiness under the
eyes, this I knew being a sign of dropsy. I tried every-
thing I heard of, hoping to get well again, but nothing-
seemed to suit me until I got Doan’s Backache Kidney
Pills. This remedy acted on the kidneys straight away,
giving me relief in a few days, and as I continued
taking the pills my health rapidly improved, three
bottles making a perfect cure, and I have been free of
kidney trouble ever since.”

The tank is, of course, the old chariot of
Assyria and Egypt with modern weapons,
modern walking fortifications and modern
driving power. If Elisha, the prophet, were
dying in his bed to-day the wail of Joash,
the king, would only be slightly varied. It
would run: “O my father, my father; the
tank of Israel and the air-planes thereof!”
The implement, is notable, not merely on its
own account, but because it is the inevitable
father of the great super-tank—the Flat-
tener of Cities—which is coming, though it
basil t yet arrived. A fight between the
super-tank and the perfected Greek fire
squirt would be worth seeing.
Curiously enough, the burning-glass has
taken no prominent place in the Great War.
This is remarkable, as the affair seems to be
really perfect—has been so for a very Ion"
time —requiring only to be made larger and
more of it. It is cheap, and it is so simple
Hi at ill-conditioned persons make a crude
lorm of it with a broken bottle, and use it
to set fire to the squatter’s grass. Properly
applied, it should serve to wither cities and
crops, and to thaw out frozen harbors, and
lo boil water, and fry chops, and ringbark
armies, and drive snakes out of holes, and
chase herds of wild animals out of forests,
and dry up rivers, and explode magazines,
and make or unmake droughts, and create
summer where no summer is due. Above all
things, the burning glass, if it was big
enough and numerous enough, could molt the
ice at the. Poles, and expose the land under-
neath which no one has yet seen. On the
ground underneath it might lie possible to
stow wheat-crops during the short fervid
summer, and the virgin soil, which has never
been married to the plough since man was
the great original baby near Babylon, might
prove rich in minerals, wild cats, promoters’
shares and debentures. Certainly the sudden
melting of the ice would cause the five
feeans to slosh round suddenly and con-
siderably. There would be a rising of the
waters which might inundate the Ninety
Mile Beach, the borders of the Gulf of Car-
pentaria, Eucla, Five Dock, Melbourne.
Texas, the Netherlands. Denmark and other
fiat places. But it is impossible to change
the traditions of old Time and ancient
Space without breaking an egg or two.
Speaking of Time, the Great War will
probably be the driving force required to
start man on a new branch of inquiry. He
has learned to travel upward, but it was
only vesterday that he learned to travel
upward very high. He has learned to travel
downward, but it is very, very recently that
he learned how to travel downward to any
great distance, and the art is still in its
infancy. The boring of the Complete Hole,
so that any human being can fall right
through the earth by gravitation and cross
the globe per medium of his own weight,
is still to come, like the upward movement
that will send him to other worlds. And the
first primitive rudimentary machine for
carrying passengers backwards and forwards
along the roads of Time hasn’t been com-
menced yet. It exists in Fiction, hut even
the keel hasn’t been laid in Fact. Yet it
will come because it is wanted ; how badly it
is wanted this war has shown. Never
before, in historical times, were there so
many refugees and so few vacant places to
refuge in. When the requisite implement is
devised, hordes of refugees will take passage
by it, and instead of going across the borders
of land or sea to another country they will
speed across tire borders of the centuries to
another millennium. The discontented and
the dispossessed and the disgruntled and the
overcrowded will get into the up-to-date
travelling apparatus, each with a gun and
an axe and a sandwich and a huge bag of
cartridges, and try their luck. So Julius
Caesar may find a horde of Australian
strangers clearing the British forests for
settlement, and receive the surprise of his
life. Or William the Norman may get his
head blown off and his whole army gassed,
thereby obliterating in advance the Plan-
tagenets, and the Tudors, and the Stuarts,
and the Hanoverians, and wiping up George
Y.’s claim to the throne, and that king
himself and all his relations. And other
refugees will drive forward into the Future,
and come back with strange, undreamt-of
weapons, which will' blow the innnards out
of the Present. And To-morrow coming back
will meet Yesterday coming forward, and
they will fight like fiends on top of To-day,
and To-day will have a devil of a time, and
will fly for its life either into- extreme
Futurity or into the oldest kind of Antiq-
uity. Then no one will write history, for
when history ceases to be fixed, and becomes
a fluid thing, washing to and fro and here
and there, and Darius may cease to be
because he never was, through Billjim get-
ting there ahead of him, and Alexander the
Great may be supplanted before he was born
by somebody who wasn’t born till 2500 years
after he was dead, all matters will be too
unsettled and unfixed for print. It will then
be a poor country which hasn't 157 authen-
tic beginnings, and 2ft distinct civilisations
and 100 dynasties, republics, anarchies and
revolutions reigning at once all the time.
There are also possibilities about a lever
which will upset cities: and about an auto-
matic king, so that William Hohenzollern,
when lie is dethroned and sent back into the
glacial period, and left there, may be
succeeded by a Hydraulic Hypocrite, or an
Electric Pecksniff, or a Steam Brute. But
these proposals are too wild to call for con-
sideration.

Makin' a Home.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
ALTHOUGH the day was sunless, a
hot, parching wind from the North-
West seemed to sap the life and
energy from every living thing; a haze from
some far-off bushfire changed distant objects
into ghostly unrealities ; the usual voices of
the bush were hushed and all nature
appeared to be sunk in listless apathy.
A day on which each movement bathed the
body in perspiration and every breath seemed
to stifle, work became a burden; yet out in
the farthest paddock Lizzie Morris was help-
ing with the stumping. Her skirt was
bunched up around her waist, showing heavy
hobnailed boots and a coarse petticoat made
from flourbags; on her head was a maws
peaked cap, from under which her hair
escaped in wisps that clung damply to her
perspiring face.
Her father, a lanky, dour-looking man, was
yoking up a couple of bullocks, preparatory
to hauling out the stump that he and Sam
had been nearly all the morning excavating
and chopping clear of its long radiating roots.
“All clear there?” called Morris.
“Right-o,” replied Sam, scrambling out of
the hole and leaning on the axe, while allow-
ing his eyes to wander to where Lizzie was
dragging loose roots out of the broken soil
and piling them in heaps ready for firing
“Don’t go ter sleep there! Git that pole
and put one end under the stump an’ be
ready t’ lever ’er up when I say the word.”
But Sam was still gazing towards the
distant Lizzie.
“Y’ know, boss, I reckon that there work’s
too stiff for a girl; it’s terrible hard on the
back.”
Morris snorted. “Hard on the back, eh!
What was her back made for, I like ter know.
An’ what the devil has it got t’ do with you,
anyway ?”
“Oh, nothin’. On’y I wus just thinkin’,
that’s all.”
“Well, think about what y' doin’, an’ per-
haps yer’ll do it right. That ain’t the way
ter use a lever; git: a log an’ put under it
just on the edge of the hole.”
“Course, it's got nothin’ ter do with me,”
Sam continued, “but I reckon a girl oughten
ter graft like a man ; they ain’t built that
way. An’ it don't give ’em a chance ter be
any good at things they ougbter know, like
cookin’ or sewin’.”
“Perhaps yer think I oughter buy ’er a
pi a liner and ’ave ’er taught paintin’! Now,
shut yer mouth an’ git busy. Are yer ready
there?”
“Wait a bit; now !”
“Hey, Darky ! Hey, Poley ! Git there,
blarst yer hides!”
The bullocks, after the manner of their
kind, were slow to move, and there was much
swishing of tails and shaking of heads before
the trace-chains tightened : then in their pon-
derous way they swung first to one side and
then to the other, while Morris shouted
profanity.
As though loath to leave the spot where it
had reigned so long, the remains of the great
tree taxed the strength of the bullocks and
Morris’s vocabulary to their utmost before it
consented to move. Then with some of its
still intact roots like giant feelers, the squat
stump resembled some monstrous spider as it
climbed slowly out of the hole.
“Phew ! that’s that cow settled. Gawd, it's
hot.” Morris produced a large and glaring
bandana handkerchief, which he proceeded to
use much as one would use a bath-towel.
After a glance at the grey sky as though in
search of the sun, he continued : “I dunno,
but something seems to tell me it’s time fer
tucker.”
lie cupped his hands in front of his mouth
and shouted, “Hey, Lizzie.”
There was no response, so he picked up a
piece of bark that was lying near, rolled it
up roughly in the shape of a funnel and tried
again.
“Hey, Liz-zie-e-e.”
The distant girl rose from her task and
straightened her back.
“It's time to boil the billy.”
Lizzie turned away with a wave of the
hand to indicate that she understood, while
the men finished their job of casting loose
the chains from the conquered stump.
The sultry, oppressive atmosphere dulled
desire for food, so the meal of the three con-
sisted mostly of steaming pannikins of tea.
In the intervals of sipping her tea Lizzie
was absorbed in extracting a splinter from
her palm with the point of a pin. Every
now and then she would draw in her breath
sharply with a siffling sound that caused
Sam’s lips to set each time in sympathy.
“Thank goodness, that's out!” exclaimed
Lizzie at last. “The darn thing has been
worrying me all the morn in'. See yer got
the big feller out all right. I hope yer didn’t
leave many of them stragglin’ roots fer me ter
grub out; I’m sick of luggin’ at the rotten
things.”
“Y’ make a devil of a fuss over a bit of
work,” remarked her father, as he walked
off. “Come on, you.”
But Sam lingered uncertainly, watching
Lizzie’s every movement with a round-eyed
stare, until, with his great fiorid face redder
than usual, he blurted:
“Y’ know. Liz, I think a lot of you, an’ T
don’t like t’ see you toilin’ like a. road-
mender. I wus wonderin’ —that is—yer see
—er—if we wus ter git married. I been
savin’ up all the time I've worked fer yer
old man, an’—er—what about it?”
Lizzie examined carefully the place on her
hand where the splinter had Deem
“Oh, I dunno. 1 s’pose we might ’s
well.”
The brief break in the monotony of their
lives occasioned by the wedding was over,
and Sam and Lizzie were settled.
Sam was busy digging post-holes, and from
the kitchen came the clatter of - dishes.
Presently Sam made his way to the kitchen
door.
“Ain’t yer finished washiu’ up yet? Shake
it up an’ come an’ gimme a hand.”
“But. Sam, I got t’ bake to-day.”
“Well, yer can do that to-night, carn’t
yer? I want yer to take the adze an’ shape
up some more posts fer the bail.”

“Nerves”
Our nerves are similar to an intri-
cate network of telegraph wires.
Controlled and nourished by a
portion of the brain —known as
the nerve centres —the delicate
threadlike nerves radiate in all
directions throughout the body.
So long as the nerve centres are
capable of continually supplying
nourishment to the nerves, the
nerves will remain strong and
healthy. But directly the nerve
centres become weakened by
overwork, worry or anxiety, they
are unable to transmit the
necessary nourishment, and the
nerves become worn out and
“on edge.” Then it is that a sud-
den sound makes you “ jump ”
—you get irritable—you suffer
from neuralgia—you are rest-
less and depressed. In this con-
dition there is nothing to equal
