SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 3, 1887.
South Australian Legislative
Progress.
In many important respects South Austra-
lia must be regarded as the leading colony of
the Australasian group. She is almost in-
variably ahead of her neighbours in the
adoption of new and improved methods, and
has actually invented several by no means
insignificant departures in the field of
gbvernment and legislation. It was South
Australia that cut the Gordian knot in refer-
ence to the currency difficulty so pregnant
■with evil whilst the gold fever was raging,
by setting up an illicit mint and coining gold ■
pieces for the convenience of exchange. It
was South Australia that demonstrated the
inherent oneness of these communities by
showing that a Supreme Court judgment
signed in any of the colonies can be made to
operate in the others with facility.
It was South Australia that discovered
the circumstance that property in land is
capable of being conveyed from one owner to
another in the same way as property in
ships, and invented for the benefit of Aus-
tralia the Torrens’ laws. It was South Aus-
tralia that, by persistent hammering away
with the Deceased Wives Sisters’ question,
beat the fact into what the Downing-street
folks are pleased to call their brains that an
autonomous dependency has as much
right to make its own marriage laws as it has
to regulate any other matter of domestic
policy. And it was mainly owing to the in-
domitable pluck and enterprise of South
Australia that these colonies so quickly ob-
tained telegraphic communication with the
rest of the world, and realised the magical
blessing of knowing to-day all the important
happenings which affect mankind of yester-
day. Nor is this much more than a few of
the most conspicuous instanc.-s wherein the
colony named lias proved herself to be
filled with the afflatus of progress in a pre-
eminent degree. There is no need to dive
into history for examples. At whatever
time one chooses to observe the events cur-
rent at Adelaide he is confronted with the
evidences of that bold, dashing, radical
spirit, the dread of Conservatives, and the
only solid basis of the optimist’s view of the
fate of humanky. Recently, for instance,
the South Australian Assembly was calmly
deliberating a motion to the effect: “ That
a dutiful and loyal address be forwarded to
her Majesty the Queen, praying htr Majesty
to allow the Constitution of the colony to be
so amended as to give its people the privilege
of electing their own Governor.” It is true
that the motion met the fate of all great
proposals on a first time of asking legisla-
torial assent. It was rejected, but the fact
of its having been carefully debated without
any show of indignation on the part of even
the K C.M.G. confraternity indicates pretty
plainly that sooner or later the South Aus-
tralians will lead the van in throwing off the
absurd and useless not to say c angerous and
demoralising connection between Downing-
street and the self-governing colonies.
* ♦ ♦
And at the same time that the Parliament
at Adelaide was discussing this significant
proposal, it had also under consideration a
Bill, the object of which was to cast into the
limbo of exploded systems the law of Dis-
traint these communities have inherited
from the mother country. This measure
must be written down as the most promising
that has ever come before an Australian
Legislature. In England and Ireland the
law of distraint, and in Scotland the law of
hypothec, have been unanimously condemned
by all persona outside the classes directly
interested in the maintenance of those
wretched relics of feudalism and government
by landlords. But in the United Kingdom
the day when these antique and monstrously
unjust laws shall be swept away Seems still
below the horizon of practical politics. The
“landed gentry” are yet supreme in the
House of Commons* while in the other
Chamber they practically compose the whole
House, Hence it is that, although the
masses of the people and all the really
Liberal leaders and exponents of Thought
have long since come to the conclusion that
the laws in question are in the nature of a
national curse, the miserable heritage be-
queathed by the dark ages, and bolstered up
during the even worse age of the House
of Hanover, is preserved in all its
pristine vigour as a means of steep-
iig the bulk of the nation in poverty
and misery, for the sake of augment-
ing the happiness of “the upper ten thou-
sand.” Australia has adopted the iniquitous
law in her customary uncritical spirit. It
has never been felt in these countries as an
oppression in the same degree as in Britain.
Landlordism has not yet settled itself as a
blasting entity on the land. Nevertheless
it is a growing force, which needs to be com-
bated and crushed even in its infancy.
Thanks to the infamous policy by virtue of
which nearly all the best land in all the
more thickly populated colonies has been
alienated in enormous blocks, the day is fast
approaching when the Australian people
will be slaving for the support in luxury ‘of
a handful of landlords, for the most part
absentees, and unless the law of 'distraint bis
.abrogated, the position 1 of the people will be
;no better than that of the people of Ireland.
In New South Wales, at' the present time,
jit is‘well-nigh impossible for a settler to
Secure a decent area of Ikrid suitable for agri-
culture. ■ Hundreds of thousands of acres in
'single blocks 1 are rhoiiopolised by men or
jfimmce c mpanies, and it needs no prescience
:to foretell that in the near future these vast
tracts will be cut up into tenant farms, the
ilion’s share of the produce of the national in-
dustry being gobbled up by the proprittors,
by virtue ot the law instituted and conserved
in that behalf. It is not a moment too soon
to be thinking of abolishing this unspeak-
ably bad law. We congratu ate South Aus-
tralia on being first in the field. She lias
failed, so far, to achieve a success. Already,
even thei’O, landlordism is a factor in the
world of politics, and the actual and pros-
pective owners of broad acres were united
in a solid phalanx to secure the defeat of
the projected reform. But Mr. Glynn, who
fathered the measure, declares he will not
rest till he has gained the victory, which
surely it is not taking a too optimist view to
say is inevitable, since the cause is obviously
and demonstrably just and in accord with
the teachings of all political economy worthy
of the name. The ultimate adoption of Mr.
Glynn’s bill may, we think, be looked for-
ward to with great confidence.
The main reason for making a clean sweep
of the English law in this respect is, of
course, to prevent agrarian troubles in the
future. But, as The Bulletin has hereto-
fore pointed out, there exists already a very
tangible motive for engaging in the work of
reform. The mere householder ia Aus-
tralia has a grievance in urgent need of re-
dress. He stands to-day in a worse position
than the householder in England. The
lawyer hirelings of the landlords have
brought against him, among other
machinery of oppression, an enactment
of that royal felon, George 11., who, accord-
ing to the law of England, ought to have
been hanged a few days after he came to the
Throne. He burnt his father’s Will, and
thus defrauded inumerable legatees—then a
capital offence. The Act of this George
and his crew of subservient legislators, ho sv-
ever, though inoperative in England, has re-
cently been put in force with rigour in Aus-
tralia, especially in New South Wales, The
Act is the old Scotch law of hypothec in an
intensified form, with sternly retributive
measures of punition against him who vio-
lates the principle that a landlord must be
paid first, let whomsoever suffer. Many a
good man is rotting in durance vile to-day
for infringing this beautiful artifice of a royal
thief and his lickspittling underlings. The
consequences to individual tenants are ter-
rible, yet the effect in the point of view of
the public at large ia scarcely less deplorable.
By the means yielded in profusion
by the law, landlords in towns are enabled to
squeeze rents out of the people vastly in
excess of the real value of the tenements
occupied by the unfortunate victims. And
in the end the people have to pay the piper.
A shopkeeper who has to see the end of the
week approaching before he can perceive the
wherewithal to satisfy his landlord, has, of
course, to levy high prices on his customers ;
and the workmen and clerks who have to
pay exorbitant rents for, at best, miserable
accommodation, must needs obtain high
wages in order to keep the wolf from their
door. Hence the cost of living is artificially
enhanced in the interest solely of plutocracy.
Yet the people sit down under this mon-
strous state of things, simply grumbling, but
not moving in the direction of obtaining
redress.
• * *
The move made in South Australia,
though for the present it has failed, should
certainly engage the interest of the people
throughout this continent. It affords
another proof that the colonists down there
have a firm grip of the true principles of
Liberalism, and appreciate the direction
Liberal measures should take. In Sydney
or Melbourne, in Wellington or Brisbane or
Hobart, a proposal to make such a funda-
mental alteration of the law, as is involved
in Mr. Glynn’s scheme, would be in sorry
case from the start. It would be scouted
by all the “ prominent ” public men.
Parkes, for example, would discover that
Oliver Cromwell, William Pitt, and
Peel had never expressed any approval of
such a measure, and hence would oppose it
with success. The gentlemen of the long
robe would also be to the forefront to stifle
an aspiration inimical to their professional
interests and theif acquired belief that
the law as it is is the embodiment
of truth and justice. But they seem to have
a better class of public men at Adelaide ;
and the manner of the rejection of Mr.
Glynn’s Bill the other day was by no means
without its promise of a lucid interval very
soon. The Bill was kindly received, on the
whole, and although there was a great deal
too much of the “ what is, is right ” argu-
ment, stiil the thing was dealt with as gently
as such a strange bantling could be expected,
and with a half-promise to look closer into
the matter hereafter. South Australia should
persevere withthisprojectedreform. There is
active public opinion there in favour of it;
and the people of the moat enterprising
colony of the group~-in a legislative point
of view,, at ajl events—should assure them
■ ielves tfyat ip, taking the lead in abolishing a
j wholly bad law they are acting in accord
with a sentiment of all enlightened Austra-
lians, though unfortunately not a sentiment
!at the present time from which much in the
way of political force can be derived.
“Merrie” England.
The illustrated papers, reeking with adulation
and royal-toa beslobberment, and brimming over
with the sentimental caste-reverence which passes
current in the servants’ quarters, are just to hand.
To turn over their pages one might almost imagine
that nothing had happened in England for a few
months past but the delirious junketing of a
nation of lunatics because one sovereign, instead
of three, had ruled with the usual regal eye to the
millions (of money) for the past 50 years. Nothing
but glory and glare and glitter and gloss and
gladness! No gloom or gluttony, or mad-
ness or misery 1 AH mirth and magnificence.
But the splendid dream is shattered 1 Before the
high-careering chargers and fat, degraded flun-
keys that prance and caracole through the pages
of the Graphic, with a Queen at their heels, could
travel across the Atlantic with their cumbrous
state carriage, Morse’s electric steed had flashed
on even moss-covered Tory minds the news of a
royal purse-gripper’s behaviour in reference to the
charitable women of Qovan. In the light of that
iconoclastic telegram the illustrated paper breath-
ing naught but Incense and adulation, aad scatter-
ing skilfully-drawn and beautifully-engraved pic-
tures as roses in the queenly path, appears only as
a gruesome and ghastly satire —the work of some
malignant foe.
» « •
Passing by the hideous caricatures in the Police
Gazette —which should make poor old Thomas
Bewick, the father of wood-engraving, turn in
his narrow cell —giving another side of the Jubilee
craze ; women fainting round a statue, boys fall-
ing from lamp-posts and roadside trees, men
suffering from sunstroke, and police ambulance
corps, &c.—we turn to the provincial press of
England, and almost the first item upon which the
eye lights in the Oban Times narrates the painful
history of a young woman who was found by the
police “ weeping over the dead body of her aged
mother, and whom they forced to deliver to them
for payment of rates, the sum of 10s.” This was
all that she, like the “ obolary Jew,” had in the
world of junketings and jubilees, and it had been
given to her in charity to purchase a coffin for her
dead mother. But rates must be paid, for land-
lords must live, and the system which culminates
in a regal jubilee must continue to flourish on the
soil of that “ Merrie England,” famed alike in
history and in song, which has for some centuries
been watered and made friable by the tears of
widows and orphans. In a locality known by the
sombre and sinister name of Gray’s, which con-
tains a struggling proletariat of over three thou-
sand wretched beings, who have long out-lingered
even that proverbial last straw, the most appalling
poverty is the rule, and ordinary ability to make
even the most miserable of poor livings the ex-
ception. While fiends in the guise of women wore
quadrangling the universe and fossicking into the
hidden crypts of Cocytus in search of a dole from
the meanest pauper to lay at the feet of the
meanest monarch, some crack brained philan-
thropists were exploring the poverty stricken rat-
holes of Gray’s with quite another object. They
published the result of their investigations in a
newspaper and opened to the public gaze a
“ Bleeding-heart Yard ” never yet depicted by
painter’s brush or novelist’s pen—unless we except
the pen cf that wonderful photographer of social
misery, Emile Zola.
* ♦ *
The verbal cartoon is a graphic one, and one,
moreover, steeped in the grimmest wretchedness.
Alleys are threaded ankle-deep in slush and stag-
nant abomination. In every ingle is the little
heap of putrid and typhoidal filth. Few of the
wretched Yahoos who linger out an existence in
these fever-smitten slums had their nakedness
hidden by the rags that rotted on their
skin. Most of them had stomachs guiltless of
food for 24 hours’ past, and many rummaged in
the gutters and garbage heaps for water-soddened
crusts and the refuse of cookery. In the morn-
ing long lines of care-worn men with their poor
pinched faces, and their backs bent as though be-
neath the weight of an invisible burden, defiled
to the dock with hunger in their eyes, to look
wistfully for work. In the evening they came
back more careworn, more wistful, more bent,
hungrier and raggetSer than ever. In squalid den
after squalid den—disgracing the sacred appella-
tion of “ home ” —visited in the course of a single
day, the little naked spawn of the poor huddled
over the hearth where fire was not, with their
shrunken withered Angers locked on thoir empty
stomachs to suppress the gnawing pains of hunger.
Neither father, mother, nor shivering babies had
broken fast for 20 hours—and were not likely to
do go until evening, if then. The rooms we e de-
void of chairs or tables, and the bed consisted of
a heap of rags thrown on the Aoor in a corner.
The furniture had been pawned to buy food. In
one absolutely bare hovel six infants, like so
many ricketty-shickerry steps in the human foot-
ladder—born to be trodden upon and kicked by
the iron-shod hoof of civilised despotism-cuddled
each other for warmth, with their ccld blue feet
and chicken-shrivelled flesh trembling in the win-
ter wind that blustered through a broken case-
ment. The eldest was not more than twelve. In
another room, a little less wretched inappearance,
an old man and his daughter dragged out a life ofv
semi-starvation on ss. a week, Is. 3d. of which
was confiscated by the soulless wretch who called
himself their landlord, for the rent of the alleged
room. That they had even this paltry means of
livelihood was owing to an accident. The girl had
somehow learnt to mend umbrellas. In another
loathsome crib the occupants were beyond the aid
of the physician—they were dying of starvation
and induced phthisis. There was not a morsel of
food in the place. This circumscribed hole was
not so large [as a family vault. But It served i
the purpose of one admirably. A widow and her.
five children lived-or died—and slept in it. The-
children were little Yahoos, naked nearly, and the
skin served to keep their bones together. While
the visitor was there one bunch of infantine
ossification was sent out with 2d. which had been
donated on the occasion. With this pittance some
scraps of animal refuse, it could hardly be called
meat, were bought, which the poor wretch began
to cook for her starving progeny. Numberless
scenes such as these are described. The above is
but a fraction of the horrible wretchedness which
emphasise! in so peculiar a manner the glories of
the year of Jubilee. Bsfore quitting this subject
it is Interesting to note that a landlord who draws
from these miserable creatures something like
£2500 a year in rents, recently sent £5 to alleviate
the distress of 3000 paupers trembling on the
brink of the Tophet of slow starvation.
* * *
That London piper which must bo gall and f
wormwood to the Croesuses of the Modern Baby lout
amongst many instances of terrible poverty, re-
cords the suicide of a man who failed to obtain
employment—a common lot in “Merrie” England.
The poor devil left behind him this letter :
“ Almighty Father, Thou who kdo weak the privations they
have endured "—(referring to his two tiakerS)—“ help, I em .
plore Thee. Help my poor unfortunate sister*. Alleviate
their sufferings and console them in their distress; and, aa
Thou judgest, I humbly pray Thee to deal mercifully with
me—a miserable, despairing suicide. Jesus receive my
erring soul.”
The jury returned a verdict of “suicide by taking
poison while in a state of mental derangement.”
The finding of any intelligent jury would have
been corollaried by the addition of tho words
“ induced by a permanently empty stomach ” But
then they do not trouble over-much about empty
stomachs in “Merrie ’ England—when the stom-
achs belong to the canaille. In this year of
glorious Jubilee the sick poor get Jubilee treat-
ment also. A poor wretch with a broken leg
spent n whole day in agony before a doctor ven •
tured near him to set it. Then the hospital authoj
rities gave him a pair of crutches and told him to
leave the place as they had no bed for
him. He was likewise told that he must pay 2».
for his crutches, but he had not a farthing, and
they took them away from him, and left him help-
less and alone. But word had been sent to a poor
woman—his wife's aunt—who had no money
either, but she had a wedding-ring, and this she
pawned to pay for the cratches for her distant
relative. Another poor wretch, who could get no
work, was charged at a police court with attempt-
ing to commit suicide. The doctor who examined
him deposed that he was dying of starvation. Two
miserable paupers were charged before a bench of
clergymen with the heinous crime of begging On
one was found a crust of mouldy bread ; on the ,
other a penny. They received fourteen days.
These are some of the glories of b dug poor in.
“Merrie” England in this Jubilee year of Her
Gracious Majesty Victoria by the Grace of God!
defender of the faith and absorber of many mill
lions. Are all men our brethren, or are there;
naught but liars among the “ Established ’ minis*-
tera of God ?
The Apotheosis of Sport.
We have, of late, seriously taken into consider*'
tion whether we shall give up literature and
devote ourselves to cricket and football, or not. If
things do not soon begin to brighten up, we
shall decide to renounce literature. It is clear to
us that the man who works ‘ ‘ on his muscle ” haa
a greater chance of obtaining fame and fortune
and the respect of men (not to mention the love of
women) in Australia than the man who works*
with his head. It is also clear to us that this ten'
dency to apotheosise athletes of all kinds is on the
increase. We have therefore half concluded to
put out our little plate for a share of this gold
and glory. Next season will probably gee v»
challenging Beach, or backing ourselves in five
styles against Miller.
* * *
Any disinterested person who marks the attend'
ance at cricket matches and football matches-
(whether they are held in one of the colonial capi'
tals or at Cow Plat) will see that Australian
man wants but Kttle here below in the quality of


his amusements. Wa kmw that this statement
will be regarded as blasphemy by a vast numbe
of people who take more interest in the bowling
and batting averages of the English and Austra
lian Eleven, or the result of a wrestling mate!
betwixt Cannon and Connor, than in the fate o
Empires or the triumphs of thought. At the
game time it is true. We may be an intellectua
race—a sort of Antipodean Greeks—in time, but
we have not shown many figns of it yet. Per
haps we are only keeping dark till we have got al
our steam up.
• * *
We will here put a question to the atmosphere
at large—lf the passion tor outdoor sports con-
tinues to increase as it is doing what will be the
result in another fifty years, supposing no social
or national cataclysm should occur during that
period to turn the public mind to the considera-
tion of graver things ? We will hazard a reply—
which may be taken with a ton of salt, or not,
according to the palate of the reader.
Sport will become a religion, dogmatic
and despotic, as all thorough religions
have been and must bo. It will have its Inqui-
sitors who will condemn all heretics and scoffers,
if not to the stake at least to the shovel, which
they will be compelled to use in digging graves
for the rest of the community. No man in these
days will be allowed to become a Minister of the
Crown who has not carried out his bat—we be-
lieve that is the phrase—for a “ century,” and no
councillor eligible for the Mayorship who cannot
show that he has kicked a dozen goals,
or several dozen men, during the season.
A candidate for a seat on the Judicial
Bench will have to kick more goals and carry out
his bat for more runs than either Minister or
Mayor before he is made a Judge, that office con-
veying greater responsibility. We would like to
give here a forecast in outline of the indignant
leading article which will appear in a newspaper
of the time when a barrister who is not able to
show the requisite athletic record is created a
Judge, but it would look too much like taking the
bread out of the mouth of some unborn brother
of the pen. There will be a Chair of Cricket in
the University anda Chair of Football, and, perhaps,
one of Bowling for students with weakly or in-
firm constitutions. The Chancellor will be —bar-
ring, perhaps, the Bishop and the Premier—the
most famous cricketer and footballer of his day.
If that Victorian statesman, Mr. Jack Gardiner,
of Carlton, were living then he would most proba-
bly be Premier of his colony—or, perhaps, Presi-
dent of the Australian Republic, and, conse-
quently, Umpire-in-Chief of all the clubs on this
side of Creation. Then we shall have the Mil-
lennium of Athleticism, when footballers who come
td grief upon the stricken field will be canonised,
and, after death, worshipped as martyrs. We
have no time to write any more now, as we have
to go out and look at some sculls and boxing-
gloves and bats and stumps and things.
Freetrade a Failure.
There is a comprehensive condemnation of Free-
trade in the past history and present condition of
New South Wales. Advocates of that policy are
fond of basing their arguments upon data derived
from foreign sources, conveniently forgetting the
million. differences between other countries and
our own—differences so vast as to make compari-
son foolishness, and contrast absurd. And, by
way of digression, it is worthy of note that the
majority of our Freetraders are Englishmen who
emigrated thence after they had attained to adult
age. If “ Freetrade England” is such a Paradise
it is a wonder that Messrs. Parkes, Wise, and
Pulsford, the bottle-holders of the party, didn’t
stay there, instead of coming to Australia as re-
presentatives of the code of Cockney politics.
And if Freetrade made England an undesirable
place for them to remain in, it is strange that
they should wish to rivet the same system on this
country which has done nothing to deserve such
an infliction. It is natural that the Freetraders
we have named, and those who are like them,
should apply their arguments chiefly to the land
whence they came, for it is quite in accord with
“blasted Britisher” sentiment to regard those
islands of the Old World as the political hub of
the universe, and the sole repository of political
science; but to Australians not filled with the
same sentiment, a study of the results of Free-
trade in our own count ry is likely to be produc-
tive of more advantage, and to be fraught with
deeper interest.
* * *
Never had a policy fairer opportunity than Free-
trade in New South Wales during the last 20 years.
Fertile territory, abundant minerals, and industri-
ous and—according to their lights —enterprising
people—these were the guarantors of progress, and
ssif these were not sufficient, the work of national
development was assisted by huge subsidies from
Bhroad. English capitalists, unable to find profit-
able investments in their own market, have sent
million after million out here for investment, the
lavish State expenditure having given an appear-
ance of wondrous prosperity to the community,
and thus made it attractive to those in search of
new fields for financial operations. And beyon'd
the influx of private capital there have been the
enormous loans contracted and spent by the State.
Since 1876 no less than £29,271,730 has been her-
towed by successive Governments, and of that
anm £23,589,687 has in the last decade been spent.
Then, too, the extravagant conversion of the
national land capital into cash has led to large
emulation of money, and promotion of enterprise,
fhe proceeds of land-sales, without reckoning the
amount received for land-occupation during the
decade, amount to £17,901.667, and yet this acoes-
Sl °n of revenue has-not been sufficient for prodigal
“dnUterg, for the surplus of £3,510,000 in 1876
had changed to a deficit of £2,568,000 by the end
of 1886. Adding the totals of loan monies, and land
sales, to the surplus and deficit, as above stated, a
total for these four items of £17,531,351 is shown ;
to that extent was the Treasury during 1876-86,
assisted by increment of purely adventitious
character. The land is now lost to the State fo
ever, the surplus has become a debt, and on ac
count of the loans £1,676,000 is now yearly re
quired for interest. When it is discovered tha
the average population during the decade wa
only 810,610 the impetus resulting from the ex
penditure of the above sum is made manifest
This sum represents an average of £5 17s. 2d, pe
year for every man, woman, and child in the com
munity; or supposing that the able-bodied pro
ducers in the community are one-fifthof the whole
the subsidy would amount to £29 ss. lOd. per year
for each such one during the years from 1877-86
inclusive. With such substantial and enormous
foreign aids to prosperity the period mentioned
should have been one of unprecedented progress
and as the expenditure has not decreased up tc
date, phenomenal briskness and soundness should
characterise the commerce and business of the
community.
* * *
That such is not the case is too evident a fact to
need assertion. The terrible depression of the
present, and the gloomy outlook for the future,
will be admitted by the most rabid of Freetraders.
It is stated upon good authority that the landlords
of 1500 houses in Sydney suburbs seek vainly for
tenants ; capitalists vainly seek investment for
their profitless thousands; manufacturers generally
find that all the markets overflow, and that their
goods are without demand ; and tens of thousands
of labourers spend in vain search for employment
the time which should be spent in the creation ol
national wealth. So greatly has the purchasing
power of the community decreased that during the
first half of this year imports have decreased by
more than £2,500,000, and so firmly has depression
settled on the colony that, land revenue apart, the
State income for last quarter is less by £16,000
than that of the same quarter of the previous
year. In 1886, the net earnings of the railways
were less than they were in 1881 when there were
only 995 miles open as against 1890 at present 1
and only £11,778,819 had been expended in con-
struction as against £24,079,555 in 1886, Other
proofs of depression-such, for instance, as the
present price of Hudson Bros’, shares—it is
superfluous to quote. Admittedly the present
time is, in a commercial sense, the most disastrous
ever experienced by the community, and every
probability seems to favour the view that even
yet the worst phase of this national calamity has
still to be experienced.

The striking contrast between the extraordinary
inducements to prosperity in recent years and the
intensity of the present depression, give emphatic
denial to those who boast the virtues of a Free-
trade policy. The stipendiary Pulsford and his
sect are continually saying what prosperity Free-
trade must bring, and promising the prosperity
that it is to bring in the future ; but beholding
the disaster wrought by that policy in the past—
in spite of the adventitious stimulus given to
enterprise in the manner above described—and
the depression of the present time, the value of
such arguments and such promises may be accu-
rately estimated. If Freetrade could not succeed
as the national policy in the past, it is certain
beyond peradventure that it cannot possibly suc-
ceed here in the future. The Freetraders must
explain the failure of their policy in the past
before they can claim audience for the romantic
promises of the benefits to be obtained by a con-
tinuance of their system of Destruction of Colonial
Industries.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
“Commercial Freedom.”
Concerning the elongated howl of Freetrade
raised by the advocates of that policy the most
remarkable fact is the utter absurdity of the ap-
peal, “ Freetrade ”in any sense whatever is a
thing which the boldest Parkesite does not ven-
ture to hope for, and does not desire to obtain.
How trade—and we would for the sake of sim-
plicity restrain our view to that curled darling of,
Cobdenism, foreign trade—can possibly be free
when 25 per cent, of the revenue of the country
is derived from Customs duties, is a question
which never has been and never can be answered.
It was the proud boast of the supremely self-
satisfied Burns when introducing his Budget pro-
posals that only £50,000 less would be collected
at the Customs under his tariff than under the
‘ Protective ” tariff of the former Ministry, and
yet he and his crowd say that they have to use
their own cant phrase “ vindicated the cause of
commercial freedom." There is a lot of matter
for thought on this point. From the deliverances
of the land-jobbing Cobdkns now in power it
would seem that the whole difference between
“ free ” and “restrictive” trade is as £50,000 in
£2,000,000. Taking the figures as they stand it
would certainly appear to the average intellect
that Burns and Co. have so far given an instal-
ment of 2lr per cent, of (foreign) commercial
freedom. Yet this is all they mean or desire
to give. The other 97j per cent, of (foreign)
trade restriction may, according to their
creed be re-instated without interfering with the
much-vaunted boon of (foreign) commercial free-
dom. “Freetrade” in New South Wales is the
shallowest pretence ever imposed upon the public
mind. Upwards of two-and a-half millions must
necsssarily be produced as revenue by Customs
and Excise restrictions of trade. The whole ques-
tion at issue is as to whether this money shall he
raised by a tariff which burdens, or by a tariff
which benefits the community. Henry George
has given a deserved slating in his book “ Protec-
tion and Freetrade,” to “Revenue Tariff” men of
the Burns c%to-Parkes stamp. He clearly
proves that Customs duties imposed “ for revenue
only ” are the worst of all taxes, as they restrict
commerce without benefiting anyone in the com-
munity except a few importing monopolists. As
the revenue must be obtained for this community
by restriction of trade, the whole question is as to
whether such restriction shall be baneful or bene-
flcial to those upon whom the tax ultimately falls.
Therefore it is a public fraud for politicians to
boast themselves -“ Freetraders” simply because
their aim is to levy an indispensable tax in a dis-
astrous and oppressive manner.
Irish Land Nationalisation.
The day of a cast-iron political economy is
dead.” Men are already beginning to recognise
that in the United Kingdom, as in old Judea, the
land should be the property of the State, and that
its rental, though based on a more moderate com-
putation than that now prevailing, should defray
all expenses of Government and render taxation,
as now understood, a thing of the dead and buried
past. Michael Davitt, the moat advanced and
far-seeing of the Irish Nationalists, has learned
this lesson, and he points out that the Irish party
has hitherto failed because its programme rests on
too narrow a basis. Instead of abolishing indivi-
dual landlordism it merely aims at dividing the
soil of Ireland among 600,000 in place of 6000 pro-
prietors ; the original evil will be lessened but not
destroyed, and the whole circu.t of woes will
have to be traversed by posterity until at last the
true principles of land reform are recognised and
adopted. Brotherhood, an Irish paper pub-
lished in County Derry, the great stronghold of
Irish Toryism, sums up the situation thus:
“Our Irish Nationalist M P ’s, with all their eloquence
and vehemence, have not succeeded in protecting themselves
and their country from a ‘Coercion-for-ever’Bill! Ireland
is really to be placed, for who knows how long, under the
thumb of the Landlords' party ! Whence this humiliating
failure ? There are not a few who think it is due to the
selfishness of the Irish Nationalist agitation. Irish M P.’s
have been perpetually harping upon Irish wrongs and Irish
woes, as if there were no wrongs or wops elsewhere than in
Ireland, until people across the Channel have grown sick of
the very name of Ireland. It they had had larger hearts; if
they had embraced the toiling poor of Great Britain in their
sympathy as well as their fellow-irishmen ; if they had never
spoken of Irish wrongs without speaking also of the injustice
under which well-nigh everywhere the masses suffer through
the appropriation of the land and all other means of produc-
tion by the 1 classes if they had protested, not only against
Irish rack-renting landlords, but agab st the principle of
landlordism itself wherever found, as being essentially un-
just, because it empowers some to live in idleness upon the
fruits of others' industry ; if they had shown themselves the
champions not merely of an oppressed section—-the tenant
farmers—of one little nation, but of all under the rule of the
Imperial Parliament that are crushed under the burden of
privileged classes which produce nothing and consume much;
they would by this time have had the masses of Great Britain
to a man on their side, and the aristocracy—far from being
able to get a Coercion Bill passed—would have been humbly
pleading, hat in hand, to be let down as gently as might be
deemed consistent with the general interests.”
Lord Salisbury, however, has evidently recog-
nised the new danger thatis looming ahead, and it i
already hinted that next session will see the in-
troduction of a Land Purchase measure which is
to create a racs of peasant proprietors in Ireland.
Doubtless he thinks it best te offer this half loaf
of concession before more is demanded off him.
At present Michael Davitt is the only man in
Mr. Parnell’s following who wishes to organise
the Irish party as a body having for its object the
abolition of landlordism throughout the British
Empire, but if his views should be adopted by his
colleagues, the Nationalists will gain the support
of all the toiling millions in that vast dominion
on which the sun never sets, and their cause,
instead of being merely that of one little island in
the Atlantic, will be that of humanity at large.
Atpresent £70,000,000 are levied annually as landed
rent in the United Kingdom alone, and an incal-
culable amount in other parts of the Empire, and
the astute Salisbury recognises that all this may
shortly be at stake. The Irish Coercion Bill is
the barbaric device by which the Tory Premier
has hitherto endeavoured to stifle the beginning
of a systematic attack on this monstrous
monopoly, and tbe whispered promise of a Land
Purchase measure in the future shows that coer-
cion has already been found wanting. But
bayonets and lying promises, when pitted
against the cause of Land Nationalisation, are
feebler than Mrs. Partington’s household
implement against the surf of the Atlantic, and
when at length the broom drops from Salisbury’s
wearied hand he will find the waves rolling on as
fiercely as of old. The history of the Tory party
has been, like the tale of an Austrian campaign,
one of ceaseless retreat, but the Tory of to-day
fondly imagines that he still stands where his
ancestors stood, and when the last day of aristo-
cracy arrives, the last of the Conservatives will
be found at his post fighting against the rising sea
of Democracy with the same old broom which has
seen so much service in the past. But the result
is a foregone conclusion. The narrowness of Par-
nell’s programme may retard the coming of land
nationalisation for a few years, but the tide which
for 200 years has kept the British Tory in per-
petual motion backwards, is rising as steadily as
of old.

It has been the common custom in England and
the colonies, as the etiquette of the legal profes-
sion, not to mention an attorney by name when he
was “ pulled ” to the Full Court for pocketing a
client’s money, or for some other peccadillo.
The records of the court referred to the erring
attorney as “He one,” &o. This queer-
looking description, when amplified, meant “ lie
Ebenezer Squeezem, Esquire, one of the gentle-
men attorneys of this honorable court.” During
the arguments of counsel he was referred to as
“ this gentleman,” and if a poor ignorant reporter
went, for example, to Firkbrace, the genial
Prothonotary at Melbourne, for the name of the
offender —well, it would be a caution to see the
result 1 Now, when John Smith comes before the
court for picking pockets in a slightly different
way from the attorney, his full name, age, coun-
try, religion, the name of the ship he came out
from England in, and whether he was then a
‘ ‘ lag ” or a free immigrant are all at the disposal
of the Press and public. Why a distinction
should be made in the case of the offending
Squeezem is not clear, except that he
is one of the Devil’s own children, and
comes up for a paternal rebuke—to receive
“ censure ” or “ pay the costs,” which latter, in
the language of the Artful Dodger, “ he can do
on his head.” There seems a disposition in Eng-
land just now, however, to do away with all that
misplaced and unmerited delicacy exhibited
towards roguish lawyers. In the Court of Queen’s
Bench the other day an attorney was up for ap-
propriating money belonging to a client. Reid,
Q.C,, who appeared for the Law Institute, said
that “ in order to protect the Press he gave the
name and address of the attorney ” in the docu-
ments. Mr. Justice Stephen said: “I quite
agree that the name of this man should be pub-
lished—Henry Saunders, Wolverhampton.”
(Laughter).

A correspondent suggests, in re the proposed rail-
way line from Molong to Parkes, that the land
flanking the surveyed route—one mile in breadth
on either side—which has already been reserved
from selection and from sale till the completion of
the railway, be made the subject of an experi-
ment in the application of Henry George’s land
theories. Let this reserved area be subdivided
according to the necessity of ■ the case, and these
subdivisions leased at their present value for (say)
a term of ten years, at the expiration of which
term the lessees should have the first offer of a
allotment. The second leasing would, of cours
be at an increased rental, the railway being thei
completed and adding greatly to the value of t
ground. In this manner a railway line such
that under discussion could be constructed at
merely nominal cost to the country and at t
same time afford fixity of tenure to the lessee
and after the debt incurred through constructm;
the line had been paid off an abundant source o:
revenue to the State would be established. He
is a chance for Parses to show what he
made of,

Thk Irish correspondents of English and coloni
journals seem to be actuated in their selection o
news by a common maxim Unless we ce
send something infernal against the Irish peop
we had better send nothing at all.” The Argu
and the Age, which agree upon nothing else, ar
unanimous in their anti-Irish policy. The Argu
is, perhaps, the more venomous of the two.
recently—when reviewing a work written by or
of the Irish Nationalist members of the House o:
Commons— denounced the author and all h
confreres as “disloyal felons,” and stated tha
the cause of all their “wickedness” arose from
the fact “ that they had not been brought up i
English schools of thought and morals.” Th:
was, no doubt, the Argus’ quiet, satirical way
alluding to the plunder and profligacy characte
istic of English rule in Ireland ; to that history
crime vide Hume— unequalled in any other coun
try; to the past fashionable prostitution whic
obtained in the Court at Dublin; to that famec
pension-list o’er-burdened with the names of th
mistresses of official profligates; to Elizabet
Villiers —the lady friend of William of Drang
who was granted an estate in Ireland valued ■£
£120,000; to the Duchess of Kendal and th
Countess of Darlington—the platonic fancies o
George 1.-who bad each £6OOO per annum ; t
Lady Walsingham— left-handed daughter of th
Duchess of Kendal—who enjoyed a pension o
£l6OO a year; to Lady Walmoden —one of th
Dutch mistresses of George ll.—who cut a cape
on an Irish pension of £3OOO a year ; to the Dubli
Castle gentlemen who sinned very recently, anc
but truly the Argus is dreadfully waggish i

The S. M. Herald reprints with snivellin
unction the abject grovel ladled out by the Time
anent the laying of the foundation stone of: th
notorious imperial—(small i, please, printer)—in
stitute by her Majesty. “ The ceremony was per
formed,” says the Herald, “ amid great splen
dour,” Ach Oott! the writer must have a sou
as big as a pea-nut, and a sense of the magnifleen
co-equal with that tf a fetich-worshippin
Paynim. Then follows a lot of nauseous verba
toad-slime, as viscid as they make it. Orienta
imagery is laid under contribution, and the accoun
of the regal shivoo is absolutely blistered wit!
rubies and diamonds and precious stones. Tapes
tries, Indian mats, and Persian shawls, sheen anc
rustle down the column or so of print in dazzlin;
and bewildering profusion. Then we get
luscious slobbery chunk of right royal spume abou
“ a pretty design of red roses formed into the
letters V.R.1.” Oh, shade of Lancaster, wh;
red ? Is it because the Queen is also an empress
and empires being founded in blood, does the red
rose typify a government by those who have
drenched the pure white flower of the common
wealth in the crimson ebbing life of a slain free
dom? We drop the account right here. The
drivel grows more sickening as it proceeds. When
we’re called upon to choose between Monarchy
and whisky, we’ll take whisky.
Ihe acquittal by a Melbourne jury of Michael
Quinlan, who was charged with the wilful mur
der of his wife, Mary Jane Quinlan, at Hotham
on the 3rd Inst., adds another to the long list o
practical arguments which can be adduced agains
capital punishment. Had the penalty for murde:
been the most lengthened term of imprisonment
aggravated by the most rigid scheme of gaol dis-
cipline, we have no hesitation whatever in saying
that Quinlan would have been found guilty bj
almost any jury in Australia. The evidence
leaves very little room for doubt. On the morn
ing of the 30th ult., Quinlan rose at half-past five
o clock, and sent an adopted boy, named Patroni
for rum. The lad, after returning with the liquor,
was doing some work in the yard, and spoke to
friend who happened to be passing. Quinlan,
who was a passionate, vindictive man, thinking
that Patroni was neglecting his work, called him
in and commenced beating him, when Mrs.
Quinlan, who had been saying her prayers in the
bedroom, interfered. The husband, baulked of
wreaking his spite on the boy, then turned upon
his wife, whom he knocked down and struck with
a whip. In the struggle which ensued a revolver
was fired, the ball penetrating Mrs. Quinlan’s
groin and inflicting a fatal wound. Under what
circumstances the pistol was fired no living being
except Quinlan himself, can tell. Mrs. Quinlan,
in her dying depositions, after receiving the last
rites of her church, swore that her husband had
deliberately shot her; the boy Patroni was in the
yard, and did not see the shoo fired ; while Quin-
lan says that the pistol went off accidently in the
struggle. Of course, legally speaking, Quinlan
was either guilty of wilful murder or nothing, and
the jury, luckily for him, have taken the most
merciful view. Can any reasonable man believe
that if these twelve men had not had the gallows
looming before their mental vision Michael
Quinlan, the homicide, would now be walking
the streets of Melbourne a free man ?

Editor Bulletin. Sir,—A former resident in
Sydney, I receive your paper every month, and
am glad you still fearlessly wage the anti-humbug
war. It is a contrast indeed from Sydney with
its trade at a standstill, its government at a dead-
lock, its appalling debt, its few manufactories
closing, and its land vainly offered at a few shil.
lings a week, to this thriving and, though only
two years old, already giant young city, with
its vigorous life, its vastly growing commerce,
its enormous development, and cash payments
amounting to thousands of pounds a day. Why
this difference ? Already we have buildings
almost as fine as any in Sydney, though the city
has but 14,000 people ; wharves are being built,
railroads and tramways constructed in all direc-
tions, immense business houses erected, and splen.
did and tasteful villas going up by scores. Pro-
perty on the average doubles in value every few
months, and the “boom” is far surpassing any-
thing in the whole history of Sydney, and is pheno-
menal even for America. Certainly we have
Protection in full force here, and although since
the publication of Henry George’s book it is im-
possible to shut one’s eyes to the evils in it, yet
undoubtedly it has immensely stimulated Amen-
can industry, and certainly help of some kind
should be given to Australian industries, though
whether, as John Bright says, a subsidy or bounty
system is not better than import duties, is open to
question. Assuredly anything is better than taxing


native productions while allowing imports to go
scot free, which seems to be the N.S.W. appli-
cation of freetrade. But the chief cause of the
prosperity of San Diego seems to be the astonish-
ing enterprise and energy of the inhabitants, a
contrast indeed to the sleepy apathy of corn-
stalks Here we have a climate and soil the exact
counterpart of that of Sydney. We are in the
same latitude, and the rainfall is even less than
with you. Yet the gorges are being dammed up
to make gigantic reservoirs, from which irrigation
ditches are being ramified all over the country.
Railways are constructed, not after the settlement
of population but in advance of, and to induce it.
An immense hotel is being built on the beach op-
posite the city, and the whole is being advertised
profusely all over the East. Streets are laid out,
planted with orange, olive, and shade trees;
electric and steam tramways laid along them, the
electric light, gas, and water run all over the city,
and all this by private enterprise. Why cannot
the Australian populace bestir itself m like
manner? The landowners go whining to the
government, for instance, to make the St. Peters-
Liverpool Railway. Why don’t they make it
themselves 1 Why don’t you dam up the water
which fell during the recent floods instead of
allowing it to go waste ? Is it not a crying dis-
grace that with tons of oranges rotting on the
ground you import thousands of pounds worth of
marmalade from England? However if the in-
habitants will not do this of their own accord, let
a good heavy land-tax be imposed, thus forcing
landowners to work their ground or relinquish it,
and let aid be given to colonial manufacturers.
E. A. Phipson, San Diego, Cal., U.S.A., 20th
July, 1887.

We want to lassoo a new poet somewhere out in
the vast wilderness of song, for we have an order
on hand that requires immediate attention. Ihere
is one more Jubilee anthem to be sung, and a
singer of no ordinary sweetness is needed to tune
the lyre and howl forth the tale of queenly muni-
ficence which we have to tell. We want a man
of eloquence* with gangrene in his soul and rage
gnawing at his vitals-a man who was born in a
blast-furnace, and who spent his early years in a
boiling.down establishment—who cultivates a
green scum on the surface of his mind, and whose
muse would make Ixion shudder as he spins round
on his teetotum in the Shadow Land from ever-
lasting to everlasting. The poet we want must
be a living horror, and when we have got him we
will blast out of his inner consciousness a chunk of
verse with a hurricane of perdition in every lurid
line, and erect it as a monument in the sight of
all men with a bucket of disinfecting fluid
on top, and underneath it a pedestal of dead
men’s bones. We want a poet as no poet was
ever wanted before—a cannibal set to rhyme, a
laureate Thug, an archbishop, a pirate, a fiend,
borrowed, begged, or cadged for the occasion
from the bottomless pit, a faith-healer, or a hang-
man-anyone in short who can turn this story into
such verse as the occasion requires, and plant the
flowers of poesy over the tomb of a royal Jubilee.
Listen:
“ Mr. Labouchere gives another instance of the absolutely
cenuine sympathy for the weak and distressed that is a
characteristic feature of her Majesty. Now and again these
touches that show the true womanly feeling and love come
to light. In 1844 an officer of the 79th Regiment died, and
left the whole of his property, amounting to £25,000, to the
Queen He also left a widowed niece with eight daughters
and a son The poor old widow (the niece, not the Queen),
who is now blind and in great distress has petitioned her
Maieaty for some moiety of the legacy to keep her from
workhouse, and has been rewarded with a magnificent dona-
tion o/ two pounds "
Two pounds! Say it louder, and see if the donation
sounds any larger when brayed forth through the
speaking-trumpet of Fame. Two Pounds ! Forty-
shillings out of a legacy which 48 years compound
interest has swelled to over £BO,OOO ; 480 coppers
to save an old, blind widow from a pauper s exist-
ence and a pauper’s grave! A few weeks ago
£75 000 was subscribed for Her Majesty, to be die-
trib’uted in charity, and out of this she spent
£5OOO in another blind, stony, useless, soulless
image of the already too-much-imaged common-
place German Prince who died 25 years ago; the
rest is unaccounted for —all but £2. If the tale be
true—if it can be true—all the tears shed over
Brown’s inglorious dust cannot wipe out the
stain If it be true, it is time for the Press to cease
publishing blank Jubilee drivel on its last legs
about Royal generosity, and devote the space in-
stead to a dog-fancier’s “ ad.” ; it is time to put
away in brine the hoary old chestnuts about the
Queen’s deep, abysmal sorrow over mining ex
plosions, and to file away many other white-healed
gags in the same dusty obscurity which covers
the Dow v and Gumtbek’s recent article on
“ How to Wash the Feet,” and its thrilling tale
about the “ Onion sincethe time of Moses.” Even
Plain Bill’s eloquence may pound in vain at the
pearly gates of human credulity after this; his
wilted, half-mast flag has seen its best days ; the
cause to which he has devoted his life has been
sold for forty pieces of silver ; and a laboriously
built up character for queenly generosity has been
sacrificed for less than the average police-court
fine which is levied from the seedy drunk who
has painted the town crimson and been run in on
a hand-barrow. We will now proceed to take up
a collection in aid of the N.S.W. and Victorian
“ Queen’s Fund.”
There is such a close and striking analogy be-
tween the crimes of forgery and perjury that one
would naturally be inclined to suspect the
testimony of a man circumstantially accused
of having written somebody else’s name
to a document and fraudulently uttered the same.
Perjury, indeed, stands to forgery in precisely the
same relation that slander stands to libel—the
first is a spoken and the second a written offend-
ing of the very same nature in both cases. When,
therefore, Stanley added to his other eccentrici-
ties the negotiation of a forged cheque, and then
mysteriously disappeared, clearly leaving it to be
supposed that he had gone to America, yet all the
while being located in secresy very near where he
was “wanted,” the public began to ponder deeply
as to whether the yarn he spun in reference
to the Mount Rennie affair—on the strength of
which four boys were hanged and several others
consigned to penal servitude for life—might not
be as invalid as the cheque in question. This man
is undoubtedly an enigma beyond all understand-
ing While the Mount Rennie trial was pending,
he the only “reliable” witness for the prosecu-
tion was himself “ kidnapped,” or otherwise put
out of the way. The police at several times
despaired of being able to place him in the wit-
ness-box at all. Yet he unexpectedly turned up,
narrating a romantic story to account for his ex-
traordinary absentions. He never furnished any
sufficient reason for being out of the way, except
in respect of his last disappearance. The rationale
of this was self-evident, Stanley was in request
to render an account of his connection with the
forgery of the name of one of Mayor Riley’s
firms to a £2O cheque ; and his abrupt
departure from Sydney, and hiding hard by,
knowing all the while that his presence was par-
ticularly required, are incidents admitting of
easy explanation. Nor is a sufficient reason for
his return very difficult to hazard. The fund raised
to reward him for his “heroic” conducthad not been
handed over; bo the noble Stanley surreptitiously
sneaked back, tried to persuade an Evening
N ews reporter that he had established his innocence
of the forgery charge, and endeavoured to obtain
assistance in the matter of bagging the balance of
the testimonial fund. Here again this eccentric
individual showed a reluctance to keep appoint-
ments, and the Evening News man, getting dis-
gusted, informed the police of Stanley’s return,
whereupon he was arrested and charged with for-
gery. But the man on whom Stanley had passed
the worthless cheque, and who had sworn
the information leading to the issue of a warrant,
seems to have become imbued with erratic pro-
clivities. The charge against Mr. Stanley broke
down owing to the wavering of the prose-
cutor, and consequently Mr. Stanley has pre-
served his “stainless” character. The public
were deeply concerned to have the matter cleared
up for the plain and s mple reason that if Stanley
is really guilty of forgery the always doubtful story
he vouchsafed touching the Mount Rennie horror
becomes even more hard to believe than ever,
and the deep impression, amounting almost to a
conviction, that a large number of innocent boys
have been unjustly punished—tour of them to the
extent of the death penalty—gathers fresh vigor
and ground for extension. If the Crown Law De-
partment of New South Wales were conducted on
principles any less mysterious than these which
govern Mr. Stanley's transacti. ns and demeanor,
steps would speedily be taken to in-
vestigate his doings in the criminal court, since
the question of his character is intimately asso-
ciated with the more important question as to
the guilt or innocence of the miserable boys whom
we shall, for the present, take the liberty of styl-
ing f 1 e Mount Rennie victims. What has
Attorney-General Wise to say in this matter ?
The Stock Exchanges of Melbourne, Ballarat, and
Sandhurst each voted £lOO towards the relief of
the Bulli widows and orphans. The Sydney Stock
Exchange had under consideration a proposal to
make a similar contribution, but it was rejected
on the ground that stock broking and charity were
things incompatible. They certainly do seem
somewhat incompatible in Sydney, for was it not
a deputation consisting chiefly of Sydney Ex-
change men which had the brutish impu-
dence the other day to tell Governor Caring-
ton, the custodian of the Queen’s preroga-
tive of mercy, almost in so many words, to be
sure and hang four miserable seventeen and
eighteen-year-old boys ? And when Dalley was
sending his little band of brigands to cut the
throats of half-armed black men who bravely
fought for their country in the Soudan, did not
the well-dressed savages of Sydney Exchange
rush forward with a big cheque for the bogus
Patriotic Fund ? Bah 1
The Case of William Roy.
The Bulletin has so far acknowledged subscrip-
tions to the amount of £49 Os. 9d. received by it
on behalf of William Roy, the soldier who now
lies blind and paralysed in Parramatta Asylum.
As already stated, Roy wears the distinguished
conduct medal, awarded him for his gallant con-
duct at Rorke’s Drift, where, though at the time
an invalid, he rushed through the flames during
the light to save the sick from the burning hospi-
tal. He subsequently received from the hands of
the Queen, an autograph Bible, and his portrait is
to be seen in the celebrated painting by De Neu-
ville now in the New South Wales National
Gallery. The unfortunate man, who, since his
admission to the wretched asylum that is now his
home, has, according to the report of the gentle-
men appointed to enquire into the management of
the N.S.W. Government charities, been treated
with wanton neglect and cruelty, is in a hopeless
condition of health, and will, while he lingers, be
utterly dependent on the good offices of those who
may wish to make a substantial protest against
the hollow-hearted system which, while it spends
lavishly to commemorate triumphs gained chiefly
at the cost and never for the benefit of the class
from which the common soldier is drawn, cal-
lously permits a brave private to die in misery.
The Bulletin hopes to collect a considerable
sum for Roy, and undertakes to see that he is
directly benefited by its expenditure. The follow-
ing additional donations are now thankfully
acknowledged
Machine Man, 2a. 6d.; Robert Bodel, sa. Gd.; Sympathy,

We have received from Mr. Julian Thomas a

panied by the following characteristic letter
“ Dear Bulletin,—Your word of appeal for Roy, of

thank you for giving me the opportunity to respond by en-
closed cheque. I have been under fire myself, and during
the last month have stood a good chance of being peppered
at by dusky savages. But none of these are equal in fight-
ing capacity to the warriors whom Mr. Rider Haggard
has immortalised as the greatest fighting men in the world,
and of whom last year I heard an English soldier sing
• We don't want to fight, but by Jingo if we do
We’d sooner meet a hundred French than one Zulu;
For when you see the assegai it makes you feel so shy,
Oh ! I’d sooner be in Paris than in Ulundi.’
Roy fought there, and helped to make history and inspire
artists and authors. His chief reward appears to have been
an ‘ autograph Bible’ received from the hands of Royalty.
I suggest that this, if in existence, should be put up to auc-
tion.—Eight truly yours, ‘The Vagabond.’ Schooner
Windward Ho, New Hebrides, August 6, 1886.’’
Mr. Thomas, by the way, has now arrived in
Sydney.
Colonel St. Hill, M.P. for North Hobart
(Tas.) has discovered a genuine soldier of the
Light Brigade who rode at Balaclava. There can
be no doubt of his genuineness. The poor old
veteran is in a charitable institution.
Maurice Hume Black, M.L. A., strange to
say, although sent to London to advocate Home
Rule for North Queensland, was not a believer in
Home Rule for Ireland. When in London he met
several of the Irish members with the result that
he returned to Queensland a thorough believer in
Irish self-government.
A Ballarat (Vic.) man is just now thank-
ing his stars that the outrage mania has not
claimed him for a further victim. His wife was
averse to sending the children to the State school,
and on the morning they were to be sent (strange
coincidence J) he was arrested and charged with a
criminal assault on his young daughter. The
child had its little uncorroborated yarn ready for
the Bench, but -the baseless fabric of evidence
tumbled to pieces in Court, and another “ unpre-
cedented outrage ” slithered into a back seat. If
two or three youngsters had been drilled to sub-
stantiate the juvenile prosecutrix, what another
fearful narrative of Australian sensuality would
be furnished to the world, and how the gentle
churchmen would shudder at the unspeakable
wickedness, without giving a thought to the pos-
sible innocence, of the accused.

“ Wanted young lady, good address, to join
another in private bar.”
Major Dane claims that lovely woman is
naturally honest and hates debt. She hates it so
much that she seldom cares to meet it.
There are said to be 4000 tailoresses in
Melbourne. We argue by this that it must take
more than nine tailoresses to make a man.
Two young ladies at Mogil Mogil (N.S.W.)
were asked by a bushman the other day whether
he was on “ this side of the river or the other.”
A young lady teacher in a suburban school
tells her pupils that “devil” is always in the
masculine gender. She clearly does not believe in
a she devil.
From the S.M. Herald : —“ Wanted, a
large ware thrower, at the Phoenix Pottery
Works.” The married women will please not all
speak at once.
The Noose is responsible for this contri-
bution to the census statistics “ Mr. W. Kelly,
of Bobundarah, is the possessor of 23 children.
The youngest is 14 days old."
A widower of 24, earning £2 per week,
with three children, advertises for a wife in an
Auckland (N.Z.) paper. This is the sort of man
who goes in for love in a bark humpy.
In America, says Major Dane, women are
seen at the bar and in the counting-house. Pshaw !
What are you giving us, Major ? We reckon
Sydney is the place to see girls at the bar.
The Burmese ladies were unable to
“ savee” why the Queen should want a Jubilee
offering. “ Has she no rice or tobacco 1 " they
asked. No ; but she’s got plenty of sugar.
A girl wandering through the country
with a dcg-chair. on her wrist, was picked up at
Hamilton (N.Z.). In her narrative, strange to say,
there was no mention of the usual assault.
Major Dane was probably unprepared for
the deduction drawn by “ Humming Bee,” in the
D.T., that bis lecture on woman showed that he
“ knew and had proved the good qualities of the
gentler sex."
The champion ungrateful man lives at
Wellington (N.Z ). A chemist supplied his wife
with 21 boxes of pills within 28 days. The wife
(of course) died, and now the wicked husband re-
fuses to pay for the pills.
\ I love you,” he protested, “ better than
my life. I would die for you if necessary.” “Oh,
nonsense !” replied the practical girl. “ Swear to
me that you will get up and make the fires, and
I’ll consider your proposition.”
A Down and Gumtrbe poetess writes a
pathetic screed in which she a«ks ; “ How can I
tell him I love him no more?’ ’ We can't say
exactly, but we would do it on the back of a post-
card. We wanted once to tell a man that he was
a maniac, a glutton, and a dog-stealer, and that
was the way we did it. It took very well, too.
Here is a whole dust-cart load of romance
compressed into one short ad. :
“ WOULD gentleman who gave young lady several
’ T hooks at the Melbourne Coffee Palace, one con-
toining ‘ Young Mrs. Jardine,' and another ‘ The Wreck
of the Oroavenor,’ kindly write to her to the General
Post Office.’'
Vero ish dot young man now ?
B shop Neville, of N.Z., declares that
among the young girls of that colony there is not
only a want of modesty, but a knowledge of evil,
and an allowance of evil that exhibited itself in
ways the most disgusting.” As all the school
teachers and boards deny the accusation, and the
Bishop says that “he has been told, you know,”
and does not know it of his own knowledge,
things are getting pretty lively for his lordship
They marry not wisely but too much in
Melbourne. Harriet Pender, who left her hus-
band years ago when she was but twenty-one, and
took unto herself another husband, is in the
meshes cf the law. Her number cue husband,
who followed her example and amalgamated with
a second wife, also languishes in a strong lock-up,
and the probability is that both will be gaoled tor
the same period and emerge from their tribula-
tions to seek each other’s forgiveness and mutually
smooth the downward path to Kingdom come
One of the most diabolical attempts on
the life of the Queen was made by a fiend in human
form who started a rumour to the effect that Her
Majesty would give six guineas and a silver cradle
to every infant born in her kingdom on her Jubilee
day. As there are about 1000 babies born every
day in Great Britain this terrible report nearly
sent our sympathetic Sovereign into kicking fl's,
and all possible haste was made to officially con-
tradict the rumour. In spite of Her Majesty’s
well-known parsimony no fewer than 400 applica-
tions for the gratuity were sent in one week, and
the remarks made by the disappointed applicants
were sultry enough to scare the souls of even the
Coldstream Guards.
We beg to bring under the attention of
the Pope the following advertisement in (he
Sydney papers;—“Wanted good masons, St
Patrick's seminary, Manly.” Good Masons!
The Italian Government has just given
orders for the lost city of Sybaris to be dug up
carefully. Sybaris has been lying under seven
feet of water for some 25 centuries, and goodness
only knows why (hey can’t let it remain in soak
till the Crack of Doom. Our knowledge of the
habits and customs of the ancient Sybarites is
complete enough. We don’t want to hold an
inquest on their luxurious corpses after this long
lapse of years.
Two of the Ballarat town councillors have
scrapped ” to a finish over a question of absorb
ing interest to the bourgeois mind. Both of them
aspire to sit next to the Mayor at Council meet-
ings and be recognised as his Washup’s natural
successor. All attempts to mediate between
Walker and Murphy (the rival candidates) have
failed. A suggestion that the coveted chair
should be widened to admit of both gentlemen
sitting down together found favour until someone
pointed out that such an arrangement would only
aggravate the difiiculfcy. One or the other must
inevitably be next the Great Mokanna. Negotia-
tions having proved abortive, a brief, but decisive
battle was fought last week. Walker, being first
in the field, took up a strong position in the chair,
and Murphy attempted to carry it by assault.
The attack must have been badly planned. Mur-
phy shortly retired for repairs, leaving clots of
blood and broken furniture along his line of re-
treat. So Walker sits next to the Mayor. That’s
settled.

Young Mr. Casey, who committed suicide
at Poolamacca (N.S.W.) last week, was son of
Dr. Gavin Casey, of Brighton (Vic.), who some
years ago gained much notoriety by having been
committed for “contempt” by Coroner Candler,
whom Catey subsequently proceeded against for
false imprisonment. The case was carried before
the Full Court, but Candler was ultimately suc-
cessful. The question at issue was whether the
Coroner’s Court was a court of record or not.
Our natural history contemporary, the
Noose, says : “ Rabbit fencing is of little use so
long as the rabbits are able to burrow.” In these
novel circumstances it would appear that educa-
tion is about the only thing wanted by them to
secure their wholesale extermination. If Mr.
Inglis, assisted by a few score of our divines,
were to give them an upward tendency, all the
costly strychnine planting and euchre piayin?,
now so severely felt by the squatters, might be
saved. •

lished a most useful work on West Australia,

a vast amount of information touching a terra
incognita in a form readable to the point of being
entertaining. Everybody who desires a few

of Australia should procure a copy of Mr.

SUNDRY SHOWS.
Theatre Royal—" Human Nature" p. 15
Criterion Theatre.—" Colleen Bawn ”
Opera House—“ Amy Sherwin "
This is a one-horse globe with very few
redeeming qualities. Often, as we gaze on the
hollow void of existence, we are tempted to wish
we were a naked savage with six wives, or a
horse drawing an ash-cart, or an angel and with
the angels stand, or a long haired female on a soap
advertisement—anything in fact but a journalist,
and this feeling was never so strong upon us as on
the night when we sat out “ Human Nature,” at
Sydney Royal. Blighted he the affections of the
man who first conceived that drama; may the
bottom fall out of the cab he travels in, may his
bathing'costume split do wn the back and flies get
into his ear. Blighted be the sallow scene-shifter
who helped to put the piece on the stage, and
but we will stifle this tendency to profanity.
“ Human Nature” is a gorge of-red paint about,
as large as two eggs and an umbrella, with blue
lights and other fixings thrown in, but though it
has a number of good points we would give our
turn-down bedstead never to have seen it.
It is sodden with villainy from end to
end, and where the villainy gives out it is
padded with slaughter. Mr. Oily Dsering takes
the part of a male baby-farmer who carries a
pound of batter in his hat previous to a thunder-
storm. At the close of the second act he is left
sitting oa the carcase of an emaciated baby with
a view to making it confess, and when the infants
are not being sat upon they are employed hauling
wood and carrying buckets of water, and occa-
sionally they are turned out in a paddock to graze.
The baby-farmer is almost the only character in
the story who doesn’t go to the Soudan and en-
gage in a desperate battle at Dongola, where the
Arab leader gats his foot entangled in his bustle
at a critical moment, and his weeping country
is lost before he can get it out, and then
the band plays and some chloride of
lime Js thrown over the dead. Mr.
Philip Beck, one of the principal skunks,
escapes on a swift jackass, and takes re
fuge in the desert, where he sits down in the
dust and gazes over the vast expanse of yellow
sand, varied only by the occasional flicking of a
wild dog across the horizon. Here he cooks his
camel chop in his helmet and prays for rain, but
presently he is discovered by the man he has
wronged, and perishes sorrowfully on a heap of
ballast and grit. In his last moments he tells Mr.
Titheradge that his wife didn’t do it after all, and
that his son is in the hands of the party who
carried the butter in his hat before the thunder-
storm, and then the hero gets on top of a slow
horse and rides round Trafalgar square, London,
at the head of a procession. After this, the wicked
lawyer—Mr, H; H. Vincent—is satisfactorily
chawed up ; Mr. Anson, the comic copying-clerk
who talks with his mouth full, is duly rewarded ;
and the girl who sent the letter which led
the man who afterwards died on the pile of
grit in the desert to come in at the side
door in the first act, is shot by the
husband whom she had left in a fever, and who
after wards made a “pile” in America and came
back to hunt her up by the aid of the wicked
lawyer who was always interrupted at critical
moments by the clerk who talked wi r h his mouth
full. K th’s explanation is ifot sufficiently ex-
plicit we can’t help it. The scenery in “Human
Nature” is better than anything in the Sydney
Art Gallery ; the mechan’cal effects are excellent;
so are the limelight arrangements; and the act-
ing is the bast that a good cempany can do. Cap-
tain Us Burgh and Miss Isabel Morris make a
very successful first appearance in this alleged
drama, and the rest of the details are hung over
till next week.

We have viewed the “ Colleen Bawn ”
under many different aspects. We have seen it
brutally assaulted by an iron-jawed actor whose
name, if it wasn't Smith, certainly ought to have
been, and on that occasion the joyous priest sat
with a glass of water in his hand and pretended it
was wnisky, but just as he was going to drink, a
tadpole came to the surface to breathe, and he
passed the jug to Myles-na-Coppaleen. We have
seen it drag its slow length along by the side of a
hog-trough painted blue, which passed for one of
Killarney’s lakes, and we have seen a colleen of
55 helping the loathsome deceiver to hold up
Macgillicuddy’s Reeks which threatened to come
down on the stage in a dishevelled heap, while the
prompter hastily shored up the mountain range
with some trees and a quantity of eternal fire
borrowed from “Faust.” Under these circum-
stances, we mean it for high praise when we say
that Brough and Boucicault’s company have suc-
ceeded in throwing some new light on the old
drama at Sydney Criterion. Miss Boucicaulfs
Colleen is a gem of the first water, and as good as
she is beautiful, and Miss Maggie Oliver exhibits
a pair of stalwart ankles—which we again recog-
nise with much empressement —in the character of
Sheelah. Miss Florence Trevelyan is an impres-
sive Anne Chute ; and among the bull-actors
Messrs. Inman (Hardress Cragan), Haygarth
(Danny Mann), and Boucioault (Myles-na-Cop-
paleen) are perhaps the best of a good lot. The
scenery—particularly the water cave—is excel-
lent, but sometimes it is not hauled down far
enough, and, consequently, a pair of solid feet
become visible prancing over the meadow behind,
while the owner of those hoofs revels in blissful
unconsciousness of the fact that he is exhibiting
the forked end of himself to the audience.

Miss Amy Sher win’s voice is, if possible,
in batter order this week than last, and the
Y.M.C.A. Hall has been crowded. Even the
moral atmosphere of Sydney clears a little when
Miss Sherwin sings her melodies of rosy seas and
moonlit waters, of summer sunsets and starry
skies, of love and goddesses and drink, and roams
in music over the golden sands of an El Dorado in
B flat whose precise latitude and longitude is
somewhere in the nether dowels of the grand
piano; and when she tells in her sweet soprano of
the dewy morn and the music of the newly-
awakened birds she touches a long-silent chord in
the ropy bosom of the newspaper man, who never
yet saw the sun rise except when he was going
home after a weary night spent in correcting
proo'a and throwing things at the printer. Excuse
this emotion. It is only a passing weakness born
of rolling in with the milk in the morning and
wishing we were dead.

“Dorothy” is humming away merrily
at Melbourne Princess’s. The opera is a
many-sided success which pleases from
several points of view. You can put your ear
close to the music and look well into it, without
offending the organ of smell. Scenery, dresses,
girls, and groupings are harmoniously blended in
a tender tout ensemble. The dialogue, never
brilliant and never dull, is a refreshing chauge
from W. S. Gilbert's, stereotyped funniness, and
the;plot hangs togjther in sober disorder. Mr.
Elton, as a low-comedy bailiff, shines right away
through; Mr. Woodfleld scintillates generally, and
Mr. Frederici (inclined to be pretty) sings a good
song lugged in unexpectedly. In the name char-
acter Miss Leonora Braham turns out to be nearly
as sweet as her preliminary notices, which re-
minds us that ths Triumvirate’s imported stars
are weighted with too much jam bof ore they make
a start. That smiling sunbeam, Miss Aggie
Kelton, lends much joyousness to the proceedings,
but Miss Barnett’s non-
descript part is too small
for the wearer. The rest
do something in credit-
able style. Under this
head is included Mr.
Duncan Young, who ex-
cites interest for cei nu-
bial reasons. He appi ars
to be an unassuming
stranger, and might i ass

Saturday evening, Mr.

clear to our duke that
the last Bulletin notice
was not such as he (the
manager) would have
written himself. There
was a husky tremor in
his voice, too, which
showed him to be suffer-
ing from suppressed feel-
ings of an aggravated
nature. Something told
our duke that it wou d
be well to withdraw,
promptly and quietly, ai d
in one piece. So the
duke did what some-
thing told him. Rumours
that “ London Assur-
ance’ was “going well’
reached him in his
exile, but pecuniary
obstacles prevented the
duke from being there to

Many old playgoers of Melbourne will
remember a dramatic season which took place in
the Apollo Hall, Melbourne, some 12 years ago,
under the management of a highly talented young
amateur named James Keating, O’Neill, the
Irish comedian, was the bright particular star of
the season, and Joe Beaver, who is still to the
fora, was the accredited agent. The company
consisted of professionals, including, if we re-
member rightly, Mrs. G. B. W. Lewis. At all
events, that eminent lady took a special
personal interest in the venture. She had a
very high opinion of young Kea’ing’s histrionic
abilities. Well, the season at the Apollo was
neither protracted nor remunerative. Keating at
that time seriously contemplated adopting the
stage as a profession. His Danny Mann was
really a splendid performance. His imitations of
popular preachers were marvellously faithful and
side-splittihg. Ultimately Keating gravitated
into the Government service as an in the
General Post Office, Melbourne. He forsook that

Miss Nellie Stewart is doing the London

A telegram says that: “After several
years continued boring, a Mr. Weaver has struck
oil at Gisborne.” For several years Mr. J. C.

On the contrary, the audiences have been pleased

Buffalo Bill has written home from Eng-
land to say that, although he has dined with
every one of the royalty, from Albert Edward to
Sir Samuel Wilson, he “ still wears the same old

the German princes have purloined William’s
“ cadey ” from the hall peg.

One of the papers says that the other
night Wa’es and his relations, the King of Den"

Lyceum, and after the play they took Irving
along with them to Lady Mandeville’s in Grafton -
street, where they were engaged to sup. Supper
was ordered for 2 a.m,, hut “ Mr. Irving was able
to go away in time to join a little supper party
given by Mr. Toole to the Lord Mayor at the Gar-
rick Club.” Irvicg must have the capacity of
Moorhouse of Manchester for “ digesting great
masses of food.” He is a perfect wonder, and
seems absolutely to do without sleep for a week
or two at a stretch.
Sir Patsy Jenkins, we read, discoursed
with “ vigour and earnestness” in favour of Home
Rule to a Pall Mall Gazette interviewer. No
one in N. S.W. can doubt this statement. His
“vigour and earnestness” on the Home Rule
question, while in N.S.W., were so closely bottled
up that they had to explode at last.
C. E. Jones, M.P. for Ballarat, was
boasting in the Assembly the other night that
they had lots of talent in his constituency, when a
member on the Government benches earnestly
enquired why in thunder they didn’t send some
down there then. C.B. sat down, muttering a
Scriptural quotation about pearls and swine. But
the joke wasn’t original. “Do you get many
good things sent to you by the public?’ asked
W. S. Gilbert of Burnand. “ Yes, a great many,”
replied the unsuspecting editor of Punch. ‘ ‘ Then,”
asked the cruel satirist, “ why don’t you put some
of them into your paper ?”
In a recent speech, Mr, “Joe” Chamber-
lain gave himself clean away. Having been
taunted with his abandonment of the Gladstone-
Parnell alliance, he remarked, looking round for
approbation among the assembled dukes and
“hons.,” “Now, at least, our associates are
English gentlemen.” Can this be the Ultra-
Radical Joe we used to swear by? Since the
night of June 8, 1886, when he walked into the
“ Noes ” lobby on the division on the second read-
ing of “ A Bill for the better government of Ire-
land” he has been drifting, and is still drifting
into political nonentity.
The people of Gosford (N.S.W.) are
wondering where on earth the S. M. Hbraid man
heard the speech alleged to have been delivered
by the Hon. John Sutherland at Gosford banquet,
and which appeared in the Herald bristling with
carefully prepared statistics. Perhaps Honest
John thought it was best to inflict it on the
Herald’s readers instead of bothering the Gos-
ford folks with it. Private secretaries ought to
be in great demand among the Parkes’ Ministry.
Gosford, by the way, is a dangerous place for
any politician to speak at. The world remem-
bers how Farnell was affected by the local
salmon.
Mr. John Norton has not yet, we believe,
been served with a writ for £20,000,000—a fact
which speaks several volumes for the merciful
nature of the Hon. W. Clarke. The “ Baron ”
slandered the Minister in the moat unreserved
and specific manner at a Protectionist meeting on
the 23rd ult., and says he will do it some more
t times unless the writ comes along. For two rea-
sons it is to be hoped that the slanderer may be
called to account. In the first place it is a scandal
that a man who goes round slandering a Minister
should be loose in the community ; and, secondly,
the presence of Mr. Clarke in the witness-box
would be joy to his enemies.
The Argus, in a recent critique, alluded
to Kauri gum as a “ mineral ore.” We should
not trouble to call attention to such a common
thing as a display of ignorance on the part of Old
Goggles, but there does seem a sort of appropriate-
ness linking this mistake on to the views of the
Argus in general. If vegetables are minerals
everything else must be thrown out one move,
chain-fashion, so after disposing of animals as
vegetables, it is clear that in the Argus opinion
men are only common animals, and the two ends
of the chain meeting, minerals—let us say gold—
must usurp the place of men. Now, this does not
seem far fetched for a sermon on small things.
The presentation game is getting played
out in Melbourne. A smart whip-round for
“ Jimmy” Thompson, on the eve of his departure
for Yurrup on private business, only totted up a
beggarly £2OO. Perhaps his “ many admirers ”
are weary of Jimmy and his exhibition arrange-
ments. Anyway, be leaves us a disappointed
man. They did promise, doncherknow, that
Jimmy should have his finger in the Centennial
pie, but the job fell through. Moreover, her
Gracious Majesty has distinctly slighted her faith-
ful Thompson. He was to get Bosisto s C.M.G.-
ship when the latter got a Jubilee knighthood.
The Jubilee has come and gone. Jimmy and Joe
are forgotten.
The absorbing question of the day is who
really rescued Johnson, of the Dunbar. A man
named James says he did it; somebody else says
that an Icelander was the hero, and the matter is
so mixed that there seems to be no way of settling
the matter except by throwing Johnson in again
and doing the rescue over afresh. Perhaps by
and-bye it will turn out that Johnson is not the
real survivor, and then there will be another row.
Perhaps there never was any survivor at all, or
any Johnson, either. Perhaps there never was
anything except that feed the other day, and the
drink, and the man who threw himself over the
cliff. Things are so uncertain now-a-days that it
is hard to find a solid fact to stick a hook in any-
where.
Cardinal Moran asserts that bishops “ pro-
mise to estrange themselves from earthly affairs
and base lucre as far as human frailty will per-
mit.” Piling up bank-accounts and speculation in
corner lots, is, we suppose, in accordance with
this promise, which contains the neatest definition
of modern ecclesiastical self-sacrifice we have yet
met. And how fearfully human some of the
bishops and parsons do look, to be sure ! The
“ promise" alluded to by the Cardinal recalls the
B.M. Herald's assertion that Lord Salisbury’s
policy towards Ireland is as conciliatory as his
principles will allow him to be.” Concerning this,
the Lithgow Enterprise neatly remarks that the
same might be said of the devil’s policy towards
mankind.

The scene was a Queensland post-office.
It was afternoon, and the postmaster was yawning
wearily in his official capacity when the dull
sickening thud of a pair of No. 11 hoots was
heard in the passage, and a large red head ap-
peared through the pigeonhole. “Them letters
was delivered to me this mornin’ in their present
condition, and I refuse to accept them,” said the
head viciously, and two dirty missives which
looked as if they had been sat upon by a dog for a
month were dumped on the counter. The post-
master picked them up and yawned again—a per-
fect agony of a yawn. “ What’s the matter with
'em! Ain’t they addressed to Mr. John J. Stodge
plain enough?” “Weill” “ Ain’t you Stodge ? ”
“Ain’t I Stodge? Well I’m blowed. Ain't I
Stodge? Ain’t I I If I could just get through
this blanked pigeon-hole of yours I’d show yon in
about two minutes that I’m John J. Stodge, Esq.,
Justice of the Peace, and letters that ain’t got
J P. on ’em you can just take hack.” “And what
in all the colony have I got to do with it?”
“Now, looky here, your g fellow. This is what
you’ve got to do with it. Just you start and put
‘J.P.’ on them two letters, and see you do the
same on every letter that comes for me in future,
or I’ll knock your blessed Post-office down. Ain’t
I Stodge, too ? Young man. I’ll report you to the
Gov'ment. I’ll teach you to insult a magistrate!
I'll blow your billet about your ears, I will! I’ll
commit you for a vagrant! For two pins I'd send
you up for a Chinaman mining without a license,
an’ if I was just thin enough to get through this
blasted pigeon-hole I’d knock yer ugly head
against the wall! An’, what’s more, when I get
ye outside I’ll commit ye for bein’ suspected of
havin’ goods in yer possession reasonably imagined
of bein' stole, and Moses ! I smell whisky, and

A shareholder in the Commercial Bank of
South Australia received a cheque for one penny
as his dividend the other day. It will he remem-
bered that the pious Mr. Crooks was manager of
this bank. Under the circumstances, we are sur-
prised that the shareholder in question got as
much as he did. Mr. Crooks, with that penny,
might have bought a tract concerning the beauty
of honesty and given it to the first starving man
who asked him for the price of a meal. Probably
he would have done so if he had not been removed
B0 abruptly from the sphere of his benevolence to

There is a corpse in this item. There was
nothing particular about it; it was only a plain,
ordinary corpse, without trimmings or frills, or
apple sauce, or any other expensive foolishness,
but the doctor who saw it off kicks up more dust
about it than he ever kicked up about a corpse
with all the latest improvements. It was all that
was left of a poor man’s wife; the woman and
her child started off for the Shadow Land within
48 hours of each other, and the child was interred
In due course in the local cemetery. But the
doctor, in a sense, kept the remains of the dead
woman as security for his hill which amounted to
65, and refused to give the necessary certificate
or permit the funeral to come off until a satisfac
tory guarantee was forthcoming. Ultimately,
however, this weird and wonderful brand of un-
approachable human abasement got his guarantee ;
at least he saw a paragraph in the local paper
which announced, in effect, that if an animal
eminently fitted to he a hysena in front and a hog
behind would call at the office, leaving his feet
and his mind outside for fear of demoralising the
staff, he would receive a written order on the
cashier to pay £5 to the meanest object that t ver
had a cold bath when it needed it badly. The
funeral has since came off.

THE CROSS-EXAMINATION FIEND
little behind, states in his latest speech that the
journal is guilty of unscrupulous meanness, is a
filthy, abominable, lying rag, audacious and men-
dacious, an infamous publication, a malignant
and false sheet, and a distributor of dirty slime,
edited by a man whose breath would scare a
pawnbroker out of his shop. The journalist
replies that the politician is a colleague of
the Father of Lies, a cowardly soul surcharged
with malice and vindic iveness, who screeches
and yelps with blackguardly fluency, a shapeless,
soulless, grovelling, dastardly wretch who belches
forth torrents of hideous vituperation, and a few
more remarks to the same effect. This sort of
language makes the leading article rather in-
teresting reading.

Australia has been insulted by a Mongol
Commissioner, and if there is a fa r thing’s worth
of kick in the Australian he will resent it. General
Ho—the soft-spoken, bland, suave, smiling Ho —
was poked into a frenzy by an anti-Chinese depu-
tation at Townsville, and declared viciously that
when he got back to the Flowery Land “ some-
thing would be done for better or worse to fit
Queensland for the Chinese.” And that oily,
exasperating, long-headed man of reace, U, Tsing,
grinned in the background, and “hi-ya-ed” in a
hollow whisper to cheer Ho on, and shoved against
the General’s back in the hope of making him fall j
into the deputation. After this there is nothing |
for it but slaughter. When a yellow heathen
comes across a white man’s path in future he
must be split up lengthways and scalded, and also
fined in a sum not exceeding two-and-sixpence for
each offence, and if this proves insufficient to keep !
the Asiatic in his'iplace, a Poll-tax Act can be
passed compelling him to drink a bucket of water
twice a day in the presence of the police. This
performance may not properly come under the
head of poll-tax, but the word is used here only in
a general sense. And if everything else fails, an
Order-in- Council should be issued making it a
capital offence for any Chinaman in Australia or
New Zealand to have bones, and the next Chinese
ambassador who visits these colonies should ba
compelled first to find and then to eat three
pounds of kangaroo-grease immediately on land-
ing. Such men as General Ho are unbearable,
and firm and statesmanlike measures are neces-
sary for their immediate suppression.

We are beginning to feel uneasy about
Bishop Moorhouse. Apparently he is painting
Manchester a reddish brown in his own episcopal
way, and bis great object seems to be to convey
an idea that Austra'ia is a place where service is
opened with an axe, and the benediction is fPed
into the congregation out of a shot gun. This
may be true, of course, in Moorhouse s experi-
ence, but all the same he needn’t keep on grind-
ing out the same oil tune for ever, and the conduct
of a man who goes back on his old pals like this is
s’ckening. His latest yarn is about a ragged, un-
kempt srn of toil who locked him in a room and
fought several rounds with him, till at last the
infuriated man of prayer was forced to welt
his enemy on the listener and take it out
of his hide and Read him into the floor.
Then he sp’inkle and the infant of his stunned
adversary and left. The bishop neglects to
mention where 'his bloodthirsty event came off,
but, of course, i: was sit down as another episode
from the land where preachy men are chased by
saoreligious emus in the course of their pastoral
visitations, and wander about clothed in the hide
of tha laughing ja-kass. and escape from tha
bounding squatter in a bullock-dray. Somehow
the thin prelate, who is imported and fattened for
the home market, never seems to have any sense
of gratitude. There is an awful scarcity of grass
in the meadow of his soul, and his one ambition is
to get home to England again, and there lecture
on the Australian as an animal who sleeps all day
in a public-h'us?, and only gets up now and then
to spit further than anyore ever did before him,
and feel if h's ticket of-Ieave Is all sa'e in the back
of the trousers they gave him when he left the

Rev. Teni;on-\Vo ids, who is wiitiog about
his Oriental travels to the Hkrald, spins a
yarn about the weaker bird He says the roofs
of their nests are plastered with clay garnished
I with flre-flies, by which, naturalists say, the bird
en’ightens its nest at night-time. The Kev. T.-W.
{ then goes on to speculate that the weaver bird is
“in the habit of reading at night.” “If this be
so,” he says, “ then of course the necessity for flre-
flies would become apparent, and there would be
no danger of fire.” The “ birds of eastern woods ”
' (Tenison-Woode) are truly wondrous.
Dear Bulletin, - In a recent issue you pub
lished a letter signed “ J. Armstrong, ’ and vaguely dated
“ D irling River," which contains statements very wide of
the truth. At the pressnt time there are very few men un-
employed in this district. As an instance, a labour agent in
this town has been advertising for thirty shearers, and up to
the present has only been able to engage half that number,
the reason given being that “ the shed is too far off,” the
actual distance being under fifty miles. In regard to the
difficulty betwetn squatters and the Shearers Union, per-
mit me to state that the Bourke branch of that union
selected certain rules from the general rules of the union for
the guidance of its members. Copies of these rules and of
the agreement adopted by the branch were forwarded to all
the surrounding flockm 1 ster ■, who expressed themselves
generally perfectly satisfied with them ; but oa being
forwarded to the head office at Creswiok, Vic-
toria, they were Vetoed, principally on account of
a clause permitting squatters to engage what meu they
pleased, the Union demanding that all shearers should be
engaged through the Union officers. The committee of this
branch standing firm to the r opinion that the thing was im-
practicable resulted in a serious disagreement, which is not
yet healed; but practical experience has forced the Union
and its branches which tried the plan to rescind that rule, or,
at least, hold it in abeyance, and advertise that shearers and
squatters would make their own engagements. I fear Mr.
Armstrong is one of a numerous class to be found here, as
elsewhere, whe prefer grumbling to working. The fact that
shearers are on strike at many stations scarcely looks as
though a man who secured employment was looked upon as
particularly fortunate, as stated by your correspondent. You,
doubtless, have ioserted the letter in all good faith, but, for
all that, the statements in it are decidedly untrue.—Yours
truly W». B. Dixon. Bourke, August 13,1387.
P—RK—S AND THE "TEMPLARS."
The Premier in the North is taking
A busy holiday, and making
Those pledges he’s a knack of breaking
For “ patriotic” ends.
In Armidale to deputations
He’s making many long orations
To “ gentlemen and friends.”
The pious “ Templars,” ever ready
With reeling brains by hate unsteady,
Bray forth like any straying “ Neddy”
Their ugly, darling crazes.
We’d send these dotards water-drunken,
In worst “ delirium” sadly sunken,
To dear old Nick in hi—zes.
But our astuter politician,
‘ Our Constitution’s” own physician,
Smiles with a sanctified submission.
And calculates the number
Of those who curse Anac-eon’s treasure,
And thinks he could forego the pleasure
Of wine-induchd slumber.
If from such action sacrificial
Might come results so beneficial
As banishing the prejudicial
Drink monster from our borders.
Oh i p s, did’st dream the cellars hollow
Would send the legions forth to follow
Thy lonely bottle’s orders ?
That hogshead* great of Austral “ swankey,”
Which drives our population cranky,
Would for thy blessed “ hanky-panky ”
Run headlong to the ocean ?
Or that the best of wine and whisky,
Whose influence makes the grey beard frisky,
Would entertain like notion ?
Alas ! my Henry, I am thinking
That while those temperance owls were blinking
Those wicked eyes of thine were winking
With mischief and with laughter.
When all the world is turned teetotal
Then P s will leave the pleasant bottle,
But that’s in dim hereafter.
THE HART BOWED DOWN.
As pants the bart for cooling streams
When heated in the chase,
So pants this Hart to grasp the brand
That marks his own disgrace.
For that he grovelled in the dust,
And bent the lowly knee ;
For that he poured his treasure forth
To swell the Jew-bilee
The wealth he spent on feast and show,
In vain to gain his ends,
Might well have gladdened many homes,
And made the poor his friends.
But, eager in the sordid chase
To gain the paltry prize,
He strews his gifts around the Throne-
The poor he still denies.
>Tis trne they could not titles give,
But now he’s fallen low ;
He might have gained somef riends to cheer
The Hart bowed down with woe.

not touching his hat to the warder when he was
leaving his cell in the morning. As if the man
who snapped his Angers at Her Maiesty’s judges '
was going to use them to salute a prison turnkey!
The other day, Fisher, the Melbourne bar-
lister, was for the plaintiff in a case in the County
Court, and Purves was on the other side. When
Fisher was cross examining the defendant he
asked: Well, what did the plaintiff say when
you saw him on that occasion ? Come now • tell
us all.” “He wanted me to settle the case,” re-
plied the witness, “atd he said that if I didn’t
he’d get the first barrister u the colony to conduct
his case and be bound tc -e a verdict against
me. ‘ And he kept h t word,” remarked
Purves,
Mr. Wilfred Blacket, journalist, a good
man and true, and a young Australian to boot,
for years sub-editor of The Bulletin, was last
week admitted as a barrister of the NSW
Supreme Court. Mr. Blacket, who is an earnest!
consistent, and enlightened Radical, will, it is safe
to predict, be in Parliament ere long and prove a
thorn in the side of the Freetrade and land-grab
party. Meanwhile Mr, Blacket will, for proper


barristerial consideration, duly tendered throuf h
an attorney, lift up his voice occasionally on bs.
half of the gentle horse-thief.
Mrs. E. Lanofridge, the alleged victim of
the new Mount Rennie oil rage at Port Mel-
bourne. is daughter-in-law of the Hon. G. D.
Langridge, ML.A., land and estate agent, of
Collins-street, Melbourne, Collingwood, and New-
market. G. D. was Commissioner of Customs in
the last Government. His daughter is married to
Mr. R. W. Best, of the firm cf Fink and Bast,
solicitors, of Melbourne. Mrs. E. Langridge is
reported to have been separated from her hus-
band (late an engine-driver on the Victorian rail-
ways) for some lime past. She is 28 years of age.
What can be that “new sphere of work ”
which Jimmy Thomson, the Exhibition man, is
about to engage in, and which takes him back tj
the modern Babylon ? Is he going to write Lis
autobiography telling us of his early years in
Kyneton (Vic ), and of his journalistic career on
the Melbourne D.T, ? Or perhaps he contemplates
publishing a book ent'tled “Kings and Nobles I
have met.” Possibly he intends to take a seat in
the House of Commons, where he aud Henniker
Heaton wifi become the Pitt and Fox of our own
day. A million eyes are fixed on Jimmy’s move-
ments.
George Coppin, (M.P. with Zox of the
white waistcoat, for East Melbourne, in the Vic
torian Assembly) in 1859 announced that, after
fourteen years’ career on the stage h's final ap
pearance was going to take place and his retire-
ment from the boards was “ Just agoing to begir
George has made many an appearance since then,
for we have heard of Milky White, Mr. Moul',
and Paul Pry (if wo mistake not) on more than
one occasion since 1859. He is now a rather
silent member of the Victorian Lower House, ami
is setting about building a tramway to run visitoi
over to the Back Beach at Sorrento.
E. Y. Morrisett, superintendent of police
Goulburn district, has just passed away at the ag
of 55. He was the son of Captain Morrisett, con -
mandant at Bathurst half a century ago, and was
horn in that city. He commanded the police ii
the Western district when Ben Hall and his gang
were in full swing. The bushrangers entered
Bathurst by the Vale-road with the avowed ob-
ject of stealing old Dublin Jack's racehorse. The
owner had the horse locked up, and resolutelj
defended his property. Hall and his mates de
camped discomfited. Morrisett got out his bold
warriors, but did not strike the route taken bj
Hall and Cos., who were permitted to retire at
their leisure. Shortly after this Mr. Morrisett
was removed to Maitland, where he remained,
until the death of Captain Zouch secured him pro-
motion to Goulburn. Morrisett’s brother, R. R
Morrisett, formerly P.M. at Hill Fnd, and more
recently at Deniliquin, died a few weeks ago
Their mother still lives at the green old age of 85.
The old order hath more vigour than the new.
Monsignor Persico, who was delegated by
the Pope to go to Ireland to check agitation, has
evidently yielded to the irresistible arguments in
favour of Home Rule offered in a visit to that
land of churches and workhouses, police and
paupers, or the soft seduction of the native
whisky, and is now more Irish than a Tipperary
Italian. Present signs point to the probability of
his return to Rome with a copy of United
Ireland in his pocket and a National League card
in his biretta.
The South Sydney Freetrade Asswiation
could on’y rally up 30 people to its frant’c illy ad-
vertised public meeting last week. They cer-
tainly should have run in 10 more somehow —
forty is a number peculiarly appropriate to South
Sydney Freetrade. The result of this meeting
seams to indicate that when Mr. B R. Wise seeks
re-election it will be in some constituency in the
very Far West, where electors are about two
years behind the age. Freetrade meetings can-
not be made to gee in Sydney anyhow under
present circs.
Mr. Goodwin, M.L.A. for Gunnedah
(N.S.W.), is going to resign. Since his election he
has neither been seen, heard, nor read about by
his constituents, and when they advertised for
him, announcing one day that he would hear of
something to his advantage—and the next that if
he came home all would be forgiven, he made no
sign. They even consulted a spiritualist about
him, and the spiritualist went into a trance re-
gardless of cost, and stated that he saw the miss-
ing politician go into a hotel and ask if they
wanted to buy a dog, but as the location of the
hotel was not stated the results were nil, and then
the electors in despair appealed to the Government
to institute a strict search. The next member for
Gunnedah will be kept chained up in the yard be-
hind the police-court.
Take a long breath before you start to
read this. “Her Majesty has given orders for
Vice-Admiral His Serene Highness Ernest Leopold
Victor Charles Auguste Joseph Ernich, Prince of
Leiningen, G.C.B., Royal Navy, to be appointed
as Honorary Member of the Military Division of
the First Class, or Knights Grand Cross of the
Order of the Bath.” Thunder! what a man to
have to call to breakfast! But it seems that
there are so many of these German parasite-
princes living on the British nation that it is
necessary to give them a string of names as long
as a chain of their own sausages in order to dis-
tinguish one from the other. We can dimly
imagine the remarks the recording angel will
mutter to himself when he has to call to judg-
ment this useless German, who, when in command
of the Royal yacht a few years ago, thick-headedly
ran down and dro wned some fishermen. But now
we come to think of it, we believe that all Gabriel
will say will probably be,-“ Hi, you ! Joe Ernich—
get up, and be d d !”
Thus a correspondent:—“ Mr. H. double
S. Bond asks Mr. Wise to read a shilling pamphlet
entitled ‘ The Curse of Cobden !’ ” Just now he
has enough of curses, and the biggest one is the
curse of Farkes for having made such a fool of
himself at Balmain : —
Has not Paikes now drawn a prize in selecting
Rirgaose Wise
To fill up the faithful Foster’s promised place ?
Some “good old-fashioned lies” were explained
by Ringnose Wise
With a grin of grinding spite upon his face.
In a lawyer lurks disguise, which is true of Ring-
nose Wise—
Else the Devil prompted him to blackguard
Traill!
And at Toohey, too, he flies for opposing Ringnose
Wise
When the independent forty gave him bail!
Now we strongly do advise all the friends of Ring-
nose Wise
To remember how he serves opposing foes ;
We would open wide their eyes to the vim of
Ringnose Wise —
Kee® a grip upon the ring that’s through Ws
nose! '

Hon. John Ballance, ef N.Z., is in favour
of N.Z electing its own governor.
Paikes says that Dibts has donned the
uniform of Melville. Yes, Dibbs is in mourning
for Freetrade.
Sir George Grey, of N.Z , believes politics

“THE USE OF ARMS.”
Parkes says: "Colonial youths are not sufficiently trained to the use of arms.”

It has cost £6337 12s. lid. to try to venti-
late the Victorian Legislative Chamber, and the
draughts are worse than ever.
The Chinese Government have docked the
salaries of all ambassadors 20 per cent. This ac-
counts for Bung Hi’s bad temper.
Parnell is reported to have Bright’s
disease. The rumour is evidently a Tory lie, as
John Bright’s disease is Unionism.
N.Z. has produced £85,000,000 worth of
gold. This is the country that the London Stan-
dard advised to pawn its climate.
“ Why is G. R Dibbs like a winter’s
night ? ” asks Sydney E, News We don’t know,
unless it is because venomous reptiles hate him.
Mr. Gres’ey Lukin, who is visiting Queens
land, considers Griffith’s land-tax one of the most
liberal ideas ever put forward by an Australian
statesman.
The Evening News, in a paragraph, calls
the subject of its item a veritable Rip Van
Winkle. We presume the News refers to Hon.
John Sutherland.
A fishermen’s union has been formed at
Botany. If the fish-women start a club The
Bulletin can recommend at least one prominent
politician for president.
Calculating on the basis of the recent
bye contests in England, the Pali Mall Gazette
reckons that Gladstone will have a majority of at
least 24 next general election.
Dave Gaunson has been quoting Scrip-
ture. At least he said, “Go up thou baldhead,”
to Anderson, member for Villiers and Heytesbury,
in the Victorian Assembly on Tuesday night.
A Socialist League has been started in
Sydney. One of their objects is to keep promin-
ently before the public mind the fact that the
Queen’s statue is not yet erected on King-street
pedestal.
The decentralisation scheme of the Queens-
land Ministry proposes that each port along the
Queensland coast line shall be credited with its own
Customs receipts, which shall be expended ac-
cordingly.
Abigail told a deputation at Wilcannia
that “ he thought it anomalous that his Depart-
ment (Mines) should have to deal with rabbits.”
Perhaps the length of the ears had something to
do with it.
“Gaffney” writes asking why, when the
British Government releases the murderous slave-
dealer, Zebehr Pasha, it should still keep the
Egyptian patriot, Arabi Bey, a prisoner, to die by

The proposal to make persons committed
for trial work in gaol, for which Sir W. J. Clarke
: voted in the Legislat've Council" of Victoria, has
been passed hy the Assembly ! Sir William thinks
every one ought to work in these colonies.
Sydney E. News row speaks of the
“starving” unemployed. Last week they were
“so-called” unemployed. Next week they will
| probably be the “honest” unemployed, and the
i following week the “ unemployed nuisance.”
The gentle M'Elhone is breathing out
threats and slaughter against the N.S.W.
Ministry. He promises some shocking disclosures
early next session, and prophesies t>*e complete
downfall of one member of the Pat kes Cabinet.
Only 345 deaths in dney and sub iris
during July, the smallest number for the last ten
years. With this decrease in the Probate in-
dustry junior barristers may regard the rumoured
iccome-tax with indifference approximating to
contempt.
“I have tons of potatoes and cannot get
sixpence for them,” said a Glen Innes Protection-
ist to Parkes last week. “Then eat them,” said
“our only statesman.” Parkes' potato trap is cf
more than the average dimensions. Haynes says
his masters once tried to borrow £5 to buy one
dinner.
Premier Gillies, of Victoria, declares he
has heard nothing official as to the desire of the
Fijians to be annexed to that colony. Of course
he hasn’t The matter stands the other way
about: it is the Fijians who wish to annex the
Cabbage Garden,
Alexander Hutchison, Grand Worthy
Chief Templar, &c , &c , &c , before he got into
the N.S.W. Parliament, was a most persistent
agitator for reform of the liquor traffic. Since he
has been in Parliament he has not uttered one
word on the subject.
Parkes says that “Mr. Dibbs is not a
very eminent man in this country.” If Parkes is
to be the judge of eminence, will he tell us who is
the mo t eminent man in L hls country ? Let him
answer that! Is it Sir Henry Parkes, C. J.
Roberts, or Francis Abigail ?
Several heathen Chinkies have lately been
run in for watering their cibbages on Sunday. If
the pious Parkes Government were consistent, we
would ask them to do likewise to the Lands Office
officials who have been clearing up arrears on
the Sabbath at 2s. 6d. per hour.
Abigail said at Wilcaunia that, ‘ ‘ under the
present system, the men engaged in destroying
rabbits could earn £lO weekly, and it was human
nature that they should become rabbit Protec-
tionists Abigail evidently thinks that the
pestiverous animal is spelt “r-a-b-i-d.”
In the Victorian Assembly, last week,
Anderson, the tall and bold member for Villiers
and Heytesbury, accused Gaunson of “ sympa-
thising with crime.” David replied that such an
observation was worthy only of the Presbyterian
Assembly—which floored Anderson in one act.
Chief Secretary Deakin, of Victoria, is a
supporter of the Victorian Alliance for the Sup-
pression of the Liquor Traffic, and spouted at the
annual meeting in the Melbourne Town Hall last
week. The queer part of the business is that
“ Our Alfred ” is married to the daughter of a rich
distiller.
There has been a row in the Victorian
Assembly about members sitting at the table for
hours at a time writing private letters and other
things. Speaker Lalor says he even saw them
writing out cheques at the table We believe the
Speaker has been mistaken. That is not like a
member of Parliament.
Last year N.S, Wales imported nearly
£3,000,000 worth of agricultural produce.
£2,000,000 worth of it came from the Cabbage
Garden. And Sir ’Eniy says the land of his colony is
so rich that all the pebple have to do is to throw a
few bags of seed iq to a paddock, and splendid
crops will grow wit hout any further help.
Four candidates are now spoken of as
likely to put forward their claims to the Victorian
Speakership when Mr, Peter Lalor resigns, viz. i
Mr. M. H. Davies, Mr. Patterson, Mr. Coooer’
and Mr, Munro. Mr. Davies, who has a good
many points of resemblance to the late Sir Wigrsm
Allen, of N.S.W,, is the favourite at present.
Balfour, Chief Secretary for Ireland, says
that the “ National League aims at the destruc-
tion of the landlords, and not at protection of the
tenants.” To which it might be added that the
Tories are working for the destruction of the
tenants, and not a r . the protection of the land-
lcrda. There are bushels of truth in our revised
version.
Penny Jubilee medals were sold in Lon-
don in enormous quantities, as were also chronr o
portraits of her Grac’ous and Wales. It now ap-
pears that the former were made in Nuremberg
and the litter in Brussels. And yet that poor
Piccadilly man wasn't excused for hanging out a
banner bearing the inscription, “Welcome to
England I ”
Buffalo Bill’s chum, the Sioux chief “ Red
Shirt,” has a poor opinion of the House of Com-
mons as a legislative machine. He thinks it slew
and complicated, laws being passed much more
quickly in the U.S. If this is not as bad as
Macaulay’s New Zealander squatting with a
sketch-book on London Bridge, then we are a
Primrose Leaguer,
M-f. Teetotal Nimmo, of the Victorian
LA. will henceforth be associated with
waT r pipes. His action in giving a con-
tract for pipes to the t L’hei t tenderer, fer no
sufficient reason, has don.; more to weaken the
Ministry of which he is a member, than either
Mr. G ll’oi’ pe-sonal unpopularity or Mr. De® kin’s
conversion to Conservatism.
The Bourke (N.S.W.) paper speaking of
Me srs. Abigail and Clarke, asks
not ludicrous to think that we are paying these men
iIoUU a year and’perks to govern a country about which
thry absolutely know nothing ; which they have in fact to
expl re—tbur "exploration' consisting, he it jem< inhered of
a drive m a buggy, with fr. sh re’ays of horses at tvery station
p ovided on the cheap, and chicken and champagne ad lib •
and this sort of exploration the little George street leather!
selling oockmy compares to a New Guirea exploiing party.’’
The Speaker of the Victorian Legislative
and ssembly made rather an effeotive reply to Mr,
Gaunson, a few nights ago, when that gentleman
was quoting from "‘Todd on Parliamentary Go-
vernment.” “ Todd is no authority on Parlia-
mentary practice here,” remarked Mr Lalor,
quickly. “I should like to know who is, then ?
said the pet of Emerald Hill. “ I am ! ’ thundered
the veteran, half rising from his chair.
This is the style satieties are cooked and
served up on a Freetrade platter. In 1886, 82,000
tons of coke were imported into N.S.W. from
South Australia, and appeared among the N.S.W.
imports. It has since been ascertained that this
same coke was exported from Newcastle to Ade-
laide, or Port Pale, carried ti the border, and
taken to Silverton or Broken Hill, and at the
border entered as an import to swell N.S.W. trade
returns.
The Made ay (N.S W.) Argus advocates
the issue of an Australian centennial decimal
coinage, on the obverse of which should be
“the effigy of Sir Kerry Parkes, with a squint in
his sini iter opMc, holding the Orange in one hand
and the Green in the other; and on the reverse an
effigy of Judge Blank with a halter suspended
from his neck, welcoming the population of the
universe to our beautiful harbour with a oat o’
nine tails.”
We haven’t heard yet who bore off all
the elegant trifles used In connection with the
Jubilee celebration in London. Perhaps her
Gracious looked after them herself. At the
Coronation 50 years ago the Lord Chamberlain,
the Marquis of Conyngham, annexed the silver
inkstand which was used when the maiden Queen
had to make her mark to “ Victoria R.” That
inkstand is now used at Slaue Castle, Ireland, in
writing out evictions and things of that sort.

Telegraph
“In the afternoon Sir Henry pi'd a visit to the new gao
at Glei lunes, and expressed great surprise at what he found
there. Thi gaol is a structure which cas cost £14,000, and
though finished about twelve months has never been occu-
pied. The Premier looked through the institution and inti-
mated that he would give immediate attention to the extra-
ordinary anomaly."
Parkes is an economist, and he'll run somebody
into that gaol before long, you bet.
Here’s a sample of the plain English the
are firing off up Glen lones way :
“ If we (the Northerners) continue an integral portion ot
New South Wales, the balances on conditional purchases,
as paid yearly, will he, as they are being nov, transferred to
the Treasury chest, Sydney, never to return to m again in
any form. That will annually decrease our presen', asset
against our share of the National debt; the capital debt
meanwhile not only remaining for us to share in bearing,
hut the dead certainty looming before us as well, of having
it increased, and that at no very distant date."
In Melbourne, at the deputation of
fishermen to protest against -the wholesale impor-
tation of Mrs. Baillie’s Crofter herring-catchers
(good enough fellows, no doubt, but what have Vie
toriaus done that they should have to support
them?) the Hon. L. L. Smith and James Munro,
M P.. ran amuok at each other concerning their
knowledge of things piscatorial. “ Why!” shouted
the genial sawbones, “ I understood fishing before
you were born ! ” Fish, fishing, fishy. Exactly.
Bendigo Independent says : —“ There is
no need to conceal the fact any longer—Victoria
stole a march of a quarter of a century on the
other colonies when she adopted a Protectionist
policy.” This most truthful assertion makes the
Argus squirm, and it gets funny and writes:
“ We didn’t know that the fact was hidden from
Australia and only observed by our discreet con-
temporary.” Now, does not the proverb say,
‘ 1 There ara none so blind as those who will not
see” ?
Only last week a N.S.W. squatter was
complaining to two foreigners that the land laws
were worse here than in Russia, when one of the
swagmen said, “Yes; in my country the Czar
would soon fix your tenure.” “ How so ?” said
the lessee. “ Well, he’d say: ‘ How have you 50
miles square of land? It is too much. Consider
it all forfeited except one square mile, and I give
you four weeks to remove your flocks from the
remainder.’” That Russian Finn still shoulders
Matilda,
While Monsignor Ruffo-Scilla, who brought
the Pope’s Jubilee present to the Queen, was in
London, he was shepherded the whole of the time
by eminent Tories who laid themselves out for
preventing his meeting the Parnellites and
Gladstonians, lest he should become well-informed
on Irish affairs and carry back undesirable news to
the Vatican. Her Gracious was particularly
sweet to the Monsignor—sent him a Jubilee medal
and her portrait, and begged His Excellency’s
photo, in return. Salisbury had the Pope’s envoy
to dinner, but kept it dark lest it should give
offence and create alarm in certain quarters.

Parkes’ Dead House—Again ?
Our artist is not exactly an architect in the strictest sense of the term, and he can manage to
get on without the dazzling prize offered by the Government, even if the attached designs for
Paikes’ dead-house should miss fire. But he is a whale for glory, and for that reason he means to
win. A brief explanation of the plans and specifications is due to the reader. No. lis the morgue
as it ought to appear if the stonemason catches on and the bricklayer is capable of appreciating the
sublime and the beautiful, and is able to explain it to the plasterer. It is of no particular order of
architecture, but it contains a tower or two, an eight-day clock, and a statue of Grief sitting on a
monument and weeping at nothing of any consequence. This figure will be propped up by an urn
and placed as high as possible to avoid the brick-bats of the common, soulless herd. “ Gr ! ef ” will be
a male figure wearing a bell-topper with a colossal weeper attached; it is manifestly impossible to
place a Sunday plug-hat on top of the usual lachrymose female, so it must be a man. A grand
view of the Lachlan Swamp will be obtained from the crown of the bat ; the head will be hollow,
and in all other respects true to rafure, ard the figure will wear blue spectacles A concealed
pumping apparatus will connect the eyes with the city water supply, so lhat the statue can
weep at any great calamity, such as the death of J. C. Neild or the Pcet Allen, but every care will
be taken to prevent the statue getting water in the head. A fog-whistle between the lips will
enable the image to give a toot of astonishment on hearing that a colonial pc lid cl an
has refused a K.C M G.-ship, or that those colonial Loops yet unborn have
wiped out a colossal etemy on a foreign battlefield. These two appliances, being mere after-
thoughts on the part of the artist, do not appear in the design, and are left to the intelligence of
the scu'ptor. The body of the statue will be hollow—indeed, it wi'l be hollow throughout; grief
generally is when lost legislators are in question—and towards the lower part of the waistcoat a
commodious refreshment room will be fitted up, at the bar of which buns, saveloys, gingerbeer,
and other light refreshments may be obtained from the Government official in charge. The legs
of the sta'ue will also be hollow, and the trousers cut rather wide One hand will be extended as
if in mute appeal for a loan towards burial expenses, and it will settle its collar
with the other. As regards the Dead-House itself, the black para’lelograms (Fig. 4) represent
the graves of the gteat and good. The larges 1 ) ones are for the heavy-weight members of the
Legislative Council, and the rest for national bereavements of ordinary' dimensions. Each tomb
will be supplied with an air cushion and spring bottom so that public “bodies ” will be thoroughly
comfortable, and other fittings may be arranged on the application of the corpse before he is a
corpse. In the lower cellar of the Dead House (Fig. 6) also dotted line Fig. 1) catacombs may be
erected to receive the overflow of the principal morgue. Deceased persons will here miss many
of the comfor s of the mausoleum proper, but, of course, la*e-comers must take their chance
of finding standing room only. On the top floor (Fig. 5) will bo a large and commodious room
for thanking victorious troops, and most approved machinery for the purpose will be kept in constant
readiness (See Plan). Envious rival competitors may point to the billiard-room, the bar, and the
electric-bell coonec ing with it, shown in the plans as catch-penny dodges to secure favourable con-
sidera ion at the hands of statesmen f till nnburied. Well, perhaps so, perhaps so The artist has cer-
tainly trDd so far as hum in ingenuhy and foresight can go to meet the wants of the dead as well
as the objections of the living—ard he points to the water-bottle (shown in Fig. 5) as an evidence
that he has not omitted even the most trivial detail, and has endeavoured to anticipate every pos-
sible contingency. Cases have been known where even members of the’lower House “ took water.”

London, Friday.—The Pope has received
& communication from Cardinal Moran,
containing an offer of 300;000 acres from
the New South Wales Government in con*

An English paper calls a C.M.G.-ship
“ the lowest grade of the lowest order in exis-
tence.” We print this because we know it will
please Mayor Riley and a number of other persons
who have not been offered even this distinction as
a reward for their lavish loyalty. The Poet
Halloran, Crown and Anchor Roberts, and their
Australian Companions of Mickey and George
will, no doubt, also read this item with a glow of
pleasure.

The Queen planted a tree in the garden of
Buckingham Palace in commemoration of her
Jubilee. And now they say that there had to be
a guard placed over it in order to prevent enthu-
siastic colonists from carrying it away piecemeal,
as was done o( old with ths True Cross. One dis-
tinguished Potts Pointer is faid to have been
cm ?bt carrying away a chunk of it in his ear, in-
tending, as it was thought, to have it made up
int i pipes and snuff-boxes to give to his friends.
We cm quite believe the story. We have seen

1 f Mayor Cain, of Melbourne, doesn’t get a
kn gluhood for Jubilee there will be a iow in the
City Council there soon. History repeats itself.
Years ago the City Fathers sent a remonstrance
lothe Colonial Secretary because John Thomas
Smith (Father of J. T. P. Smith, Crown Prosecu-
tor), four or five time! Mayor of Melbourne, when
he went that memorable trip to with a
c iaplain did not return with a handle to his name.
The answer then was—goodness! it is nearly
thirty years ago —that though Mayors ot English
Municipalities were honoured, it was not the cus-
tom to bestow favours on colonial Town Hill
bosses. But the custom ought to have been
altered in all' this time surely. A further little
thought strikes us Alderman Benjamin was
“done out” of the Melbourne Mayorship, it will
be remembered, because they did not want to
I ave him for a J nbilee Mayor as he would get
knighted. And now Mayor Cain isn’t knighted.

Modesty is not always “ good goods,” to
judge from a little incident down South. A local
council was discussing whether the incoming
Mayo' should have an allowance. The Mayor-
e'eot wa t present, and voted against the allow-
ance. Tne numbers were even, and the chair-
man. in giving the casting vote against the
money, said he did so, although his opinion was
the other way, because the coming Mayor had
himself gone against the proposal. Cute but
cruel, wasn’t it ?

The system of nominating surgeons and
physician! by poll of the subscribers to the Mel-
bourne Hospital, though unusual outside Aus-
tralia, has one thing to recommend it. This is the
gain to the funds of the institution caused by the
subscriptions of those who want to “get their
man in.” It is calculated that the Melbourne
Hospital has gained fully £5OO per annum in late
years from this cause alone.

Now, as living in London is expensive, the sou-

“forking out ” anything for the Institute, as he
knew— never having up to then grovelled—a
knighthood or C.M.G.-ship was beyond his reach,
and quite out of his calsulations. Bat this is
how the Primrose one managed it. She said loudly
enough for the poor colonial to hear, “Who is

dear Lady —.introduce me?” Now, if the
truth must be spoken, the Australian’s appear-
ance from a military standpoint was “ pathetic,”

Hobart folks seem to have a happy knack
of “mulling” most things they undertake. A
little while ago a surprise party was organised in
honour of a well-known mattresse de danse, and
the affair came off in a local assembly room.
Except for the fact that the ladies outnumbered
the gentlemen, everything went merrily until
supper time. When the majority of the refresh-
ments had disappeared it was discovered that the
guest of the evening had not been invited to par-
take of them. The promoters of the “ surprise ”
had been too attentive to their own particular
friends to remember their duties to their guest,
who, however, received their apologies most
graciously.

It is whispered in Melbourne that His
Excellency’s aides have a pretty lively old time of
it at Government House. They are kept “on the

dewy night, running messages, or attending vice-

union, and hanging out for the eight hours' boon.
It is, however, but fair to add that they only
fetch home the groceries and the week’s washing
when the kitchen boy has got the mumps or a

Much interest has been felt in Hobart
lately over two weddings, the difference in age
between the respective brides and bridegrooms
being the subject of much comment. The first
took place at All Saints’ Church on the 16th lust.,
when Miss Emily Wilson, daughter of Major-
General J. N. Wilson, pf Pengreth, Tas.. was
married to Mr. Francis Mitchell, of Vaucluse,
Hobart The bride wore cream cashmere em-
broidered with silk, tulle veil and orange blossom,
and looked young and pretty. Her bridesmaids
also wore cream costumes, the seniors having
tulle bonnets to match, and the juniors wreaths
and veils. Honeymoon in Melbourne. The second
wedding came off the the 23 rd inst. Oa this occa-
sion May and December were personated by Miss
Alice Stanley, of Hobart, and Mr. William Lade,
of Scottsda’e, Tas. The bride wore brown mer-
veilleux and lace, with bonnet to correspond, and
looked quite 30 years her bridegroom’s junior.
Three bridesmaids wore fawn-coloured costumes,
bonnets to match relieved with heliotrope
feathers. Verify, eligible young men must be
very scarce in Tasmania, or can It be that the old
men are very eligible ?

It is an established fact that ladies who
desire to assume “ matrimony’s rosy fetters" fre-
quently spend their substance on long sea-voyages
in the hope that some lonely, sea-sick man will
view their charms with favour. But proposals on
the poop or in the boudoir don’t seem to hold when
the parties get on to terra firma again, as witness
the breach of promise action brought by Mrs.
Emily Child against Mr. Hector Arden (both of
England). In seems that in the early part of the
present year the gallant Hector and the widowed
Emily were passengers by the R.M.S. Ruapehu,
plying between Auckland (N.Z.) and London.
Daring the voyage they became friends, shared
their Infallible remedies for sea-sickness—flirted,
promenaded, and studied the great deep together,
until at last Hector asked Emily to be his, and
she—being 40 years old, and having nine children
—dropped her golden head on to his shoulder and
faltered (probably), “ You bet 1 ” No sooner, how-
ever, had London been reached, and Hector and
his Emily gone to their different abodes, than he
showed signs of wavering, owing probably to the
fact that marriage with a forty-year-old widow
with nine children was not exactly the proper
caper for a fellow who wanted a good time. In
spite of a letter he wrote containing the statement
“ Elly, dear, how jolly it will he when we are
one! ” his affection steadily wavered until it
failed altogether, and he strove to give his widow
the slip. It cost him £2OO damages,

The Columbia elite skating rink, Sydney,
was very full ou the occasion of the Skating
Carnival held on the 23rd inst. There were no
spaces in the building ten minutes after the open-
ing of the doors, and later on the crush was
almost mortal. Almost all the skaters and
ska'eresses were in fancy costume—Mr. R.
Skinner (manager) being especially gorgeous in a
suit of blue and white satin, while a young lady
in billycock hat—shirt—vest, tasselled cane, and
spry-looking coat, figured most successfully as a
“ mashah ”of this so-cafled 19th century. We
are afraid the dance programmes were superfluous,
j as most of the Tinkers only did the orthodox
round whether the music was a valse or a fandan-
go. The salt of the show, however, was the
Grand March and Procession In which all the
skaters (over three hundred) evoluted to march
time, while coloured lights were thrown on them.
In some individual cases the coloured light ought,
to hare been thrown at them, but they were aa
far apart as two true lovers when the gas ia
turned up, so did hot interfere with the spectacle.
With the exception of a blood-and-hair fray over
some reserved seats the whole affair went off
smoothly.

The very latest London novelty (which we

before, but this edition contains no leaves. When
you open the cover you find a little flask of neat,

and say that there wasn’t a mechanic there that,
could touch her ladyship at it! She is “ so ac-
customed,” you know, to the breaking of cham-
pagne-bottles that the can shy fifteen shillings 1
worth at a machine with a vdy hand, while the.
mechanic would falter and probably look round,

A man may not marry his grandmother,
and, as a ru'c, hr doesn’t want to. Now and then
an ancient Egyptian used to marry his sister, and
then for the rest of his life he would come to the
surface to b-eatho evary five minutes, and go out
behind the ancient Coptic coal-hole to ask himself,
in his artless cuneiform manner, why the Egyptian
dooce ho did it; but all this is out of date.
The N.S.W. law, which permits a womanto marry
her deceased husband’s brother Bill, or something
to that effect, leads to complications. Listen to
this from a Corowa journal :
“ Smith —On May 19,1887, suddenly, in her 45th year.
, Mary Smith, of the anwe, and bi.'oved wifi
( .f ——, Esq., of Someis':t House, England—:h) bi-
level grandmamma and aunt of Mrs , of
Wahsunyah.”
We started to figure out the relationships in a
family where one lady suddenly, in her 45 h year,
was the aunt of her own granddaughter, but we
gave it up. The only conclusion we can arrive at
with any certainty is that if Mrs. Smith had lived,
and Mrs. had had a daughter, who grow
up and married a mm whose father was also his
remote ancestor and his brother-in-law at the
same time, and they had had a baby, and it had
died through scalding itself, it would have been a
very sad circumstance, and the old lady might not
have been able to survive the shock. But as the
untimely fate of the supposed baby with the mixed
parent! could hardly have tangled things up
much worse than they were our elaborate theory
has no very direct bearing on the case,

and don’t put it anywhere within reach of a vital
part. The matter was carefully hushed up.

the face to the advocates of classical education. This Latin
and Greek cannot be so very difficult after all, if a young
woman, after a few years' training can wipe the eyes of all
the men of her year at it, who have been mugging at the dead
languages ever since they were children.”

A hole-and comer meeting, called by Sir
Henry Loch at the instigation of the Prince of

shoddy has failed to inspire any enthusiasm in the
old country, and H.R.H. has shrewdly concluded
to appeal to the snobbery of the colonial pluto


cracy. Sir James Macbain represented wool ; Sir
George Yerdon, money ; Mr. M. H. Davies, law; and
the Hon Mick Fitzgerald the not less important
interest of beer. Over £3OO was subscribed, and

Where is the pious man who won’t break
the Sabbath when a sinner shouts ? At Kirkcaldy
(Scotland) recently it was resolved that the Sun-
day excursions on the Forth were an abomination,
and with a view to wiping them cut, a clergyman
stationed himself on the pier and preached to the
crowd about the fate which awaited them in their
last roasting place if they went on shilling excur-
sions on the day cf rest. But in the midst of the
discourse, the man of Belial who ran the boat,
finding his craft almost empty, announced that he
would make that day’s trip a gratis affair, and
then the whole congregation slid on board in a
side-long, apologetic sort cf way and left the
pastor holding forth to empty air. Of such Is the
king—no, we positively won’t dish up that re-

St. Arnaud (Vic.) boasts of an institution
known Iccally as the Young Men’s Christian Asso-
ciation. The members sing, recite, and drink
whisky at the bidding of the president, and if any-
one is dilatory in any of these respects he is
whisked off into the corner and stood on his head.
A local officer of government, who plumes him-
self considerably on his personal dignity, had the
shine taken out of him in this way ten minutes
after being introduced; and a local man of
law was bouleversed upon his cranium until
his forehead began to spread out like the
rim of a candlestick. The individual who
neglects to drink whisky when ordered has his
nose held and the liquid poured down his throat.
After those devotional exercises have been gone
through, leap-frog, riding the broom-stick, and
similar expressions of piety are undertaken. The
severest punishment which can be meted out for
any infraction of the laws is to be stood on one’s
head three times and compelled to drink whisky
without causing until the culprit has to be carried
off to bed. This is not intended for a j oke. It
only shows “what may happen to a man in
Victoria.”

The beloved pastor of a Chicago church is
in a tight place just at present. It appears he
recently called on a lady lamb of his fold and
found her suffering from a sick headache. Ke-
membering that the apostles (like our own Milner
Stephen) had great faith in the “imposing of
hands” remedy, the good pastor chafed his fair
patient’s feet with his hands, and in a few minutes
time the lamb declared she was “ much better,”
Then the good shepherd said he wanted to be paid
for his trouble, and he thereupon proceeded to pay
himself by taking a kiss, not, however, without a
deal of struggling and now-you-realiy mustn’t-ing
on the part of the lady. When the husband heard
of the cure, and the fee charged, he hauled his
reverence up for assault, and the kiss cost the
holy healer £lO. Quite a number of other lady
Dmbs of the same congregation have since been
suffering from sick headaches, but the cautious
divine makes no sign, and has evidently retired
from the chafing business for the present.

an important foreign possession rather than over a
mere outlandish settlement somewhere in Sydney,
Victoria, New Zealand? Or is it as much as to
say, “ Why, he could he looked up to as a real
prince by the Chinkies instead of a mere sort of
superior Civil servant —I know I would ! ” But
he didn’t, so just tilt up the glasses and give “ He’s
a jolly eood fellow” to the titled minion who
positively ca' i recognize the importance of Aus-

female mind would, probably, have been much
more exercised if the Princess had appeared in no
dress at all. But we daresay even this style could
be made fashionable in time—if the example were
set by Royalty. Under such circumstances it
would be a cold day when the leaders of sassiety

Whi'e expressing our sympathy for Lord
Augustus Loftus in this his time of tribulation, it
behoves us to point out that he has previously
filed his lordly shovel. The melancholy event oc-
curred twenty years ago, when 'Gustus repre-
sented Her Pre-eminence in Woe at the crazy
Court of Bavaria. Filling a succession of expen-
sive billets, the poor old boy had no chance to save
money until he came to Sydney, and by that time
his finances were in an inextricable muddle. The
accumulated debts of former days swallowed up
all his Australian pickings and profits on poultry.
We fancy that His Excellency will pan out half-a-
crown in the pound, or thereabouts.

Long nails are the latest feminine craze in
New York society. Ladies whose nails are short
are set down as common individuals who work
for their living, while a set of claws, each as long
as a Semitic nose, are a mark of idleness arid cul-
chaw. Society takes the long-nailed lady to its
bosom, while the short-nailed one is scorned ; in
fact, in the most select circles the door which
shuts out the vulgar herd can only be burst open
with the nails. These remarks refer, of course, to
finger nails only. In its official capacity society
has no cognisance in the matter of toes, which are
merely so many vehicles for the conveyancs of
bunions from place to place with celerity and
despatch ; and even a lady with no nails at all on
her feet is not necessarily excluded from those
circles where putty-facad ladies, each carrying a
bilious, over-fed dog, gather together to potter
about aimlessly and destroy each other's characters
over weak tea.

Though a man can’t marry his grand-
mother, there is no law against a baby being born
in two places at once if it wants to. The follow-
ing, from a London paper, is a case in point:
“June 2, 1887, at 102 and 104 Blank-street, the
wife of ,of a son.” We conclude that that
baby must be a stem-winder.

Young Sir Henry Tichborne, the “ Claim
ant’s ” friend, has come of age. He is a fragile,
slightly-built, pale-faced youth, with the narrow
shoulders of the man who was supposed to have
been drowned. “The prettiest girl at the grand
ball given to celebrate the maiority of the young
baronet vat” says a London writer, “the Prince
of Wales’ latest admiration, Mi«s Hall id ay. If
she is a fair sample of ‘ Tammy’s ’ umal taste, he
may be relied upon as a safe judge, for she is a
beauty and no mistake. She has one of tho e
faces which catch your eye the moment you enter
the ro'm where she is. Tall and gra-eful, with a
beautPu’ly poised iPad, she stands a queen among
other women. To me her features seemed per-
fect. A nose Greek in ths straightness of its line
from forehead to tip ; violet blue ‘ Irish ’ eyes ;
the perfect mouth I eve - saw; dazzling
whi e teeth when she smiles (which is often) ; a
softly rounded chin; a creamy-wbi e skin, and
light brown haw, arranged in c'as sic bands above
her low forebead, make up the sum of her facial
a c tractions. In face and expression, especially
about the corner curves of her peifectly-shaped
mouth, when she smiled and showed ter glisten-
-1 ig toeth, she reminded me most forcibly of poor
Adelaide Neils on. 1 hat she was run after by
men, both old and young, goes without saying,
and I thought she was not lessened in her own
esteem by the royal notice her beauty has re-
ceived, Apropos of balls, men’s dress coats now
have silk collars, and broad black stitching on the
backs of their lavender gloves is all the ‘ correct
think, don’t you know.’ ”

There is a considerable rush for divorce in
Sydney just now, and it is evident that there
still exists abundant room for Bishop Barry to roll
along his moral meat-cart Mr. Gray, of Albury, in
particu’ar, rises to state that he has had enough
of it, and that matrimony is as great a fraud as a
Kurts’ allotment. In 1876 he began to sing love
ditties to a Melbourne barmaid, and the barmaid
he sang to apparently didn’t care a brass farthing
for his song, but she married him none the less In
1879 he found himself compelled to take high moral
grounds with his bookkeeper, who seems to have
been a bad lot, and a few months later he again
found it necessary to ask him what he meant by
it. Then there came another bookkeeper, and a
few months later Gray got home to find his wife
wallowing on the hearth-rug in a fiendish state of
drunkenness, and hailing the new clerical assis-
tant as “ ducky,” and asking why he didn’t come
to her. Then the husband went out wearily, and
intimated to his assistant that he was able to do
all the “ducky” business in that establishment
himself, and asked him also what he meant by it.
There was a vacancy for a bookkeeper after this,
but some little time later the ex-ducky came over
in the gloaming and the lady sat on his knee, and
the husband thrashed him in a languid sort of
way, and banged his head against the wall, and
he vanished temporarily from the scene. The
pair afterwards met at Brighton and elsewhere,
and sat on each other’s knees for some months,
both drinking most of the time, and after this the
lady returned and painted the town blue for two
years, in company with various larky strangers.
She next went and sat on the knee of a hotel boots
named Plain Smith, and for about the fiftieth time
Gray had to ask him what the dooce he was up
to, and though another reconciliation followed, the
harassed squatter had hardly got home before he
had to hurry back by express train, and again de-
mand that S mth should stop this sort of thing.
But the climax came with a man named Ditch-
field, and instead of asking him not to go on like
that, Gray took proceedings in the Divorce Court,
and sent the ex barmaid home. She did not turn
up in court, neither did the three musketeers who
had helped her into the difficulty, and the Judge
resolved that they were a bad lot.

Oddly enough none of the Melbourne
papers which pick up a precarious living by the
sale of sassiety slush have published two remark-
able incidents in the career of Lady Loch. Firstly,
her lad;ship is “a twin.” Secondly, she had
been married ten years before a tenant was found
for the nursery. Lady Loch’s twin sister is so like
each other, in form and feature, that it’s hard to
tell her from she when cither isn’t there. So,
after all, the “first lady in Victoria” can’t be
quite so utterly unique as they would have us
believe.

A wages difficulty has cropped up at Too-

wants a week's wages from his employer, which
the latter refuses to pay on the ground that he
received no notice. The prisoner pleads that it

is to make tbe police give a week's notice to any
of theie intention to run him in. This

In pursuance cfour usual policy of keep-

ran*, we visited the Columbia Stealing Rirk, at
Sydney Exhibition Budding, the other night—we
went became we were told everybody went We
selec ed a Thur day nigbt because cn that night
an extra shilling is charged for admission, with a
view, as ou'bvber’s apprentice informed us, of
keeping out the lower claese 3 . If the lower
classes fept away on the night of our visit wo
would like to go some night when they are there.
The aas.emb age was quite mixed enough for our
unsophisticated taste. As you approach the
building you hear the rear of the skates mingled
with the faint gro tm of the band ; and a payment
of two shillings admits you to tbe scene of the
cm filet The sight staggers the beholder at first.
The large Exhibition Buildlrgis almost filled with
a vast throng whirling round and round with
ceaseless din ; the even motion of the skating
makes the skaters look as it they were moved by
some outsHe force. And such a mixed crowd 1
Some to whom tho exclusive portals of Govern-
ment House are over open rushing along side by
side with pale, stunted ’Arry fresh from some
tobacco-factory, and one and all showing the
most intense interest in the matter. It
makes one’s head spin, after a while, the
roar of the wheels and tbe ceaseless rush
of the figures, Whirr! whirr I Round they go ;
faces you know and faces you don’t know flit by
in endlcis chain, while, suspended in the air like
Mahomet’s coffin, the band wildly brays forth
that touching melody, “ Taint leavin’ old England
we cares about,” succeeded by a plaintive wail of
“ Wait till the clouds roll by.” As we stood
drinking in the scene, a fair damsel came sliding
up at a furious pace, gave a lurch or two, and
then threw her lily-white arms emphatically
round our scraggy neck and held on tight. We
thought we had discovered a long lost second
cousin, or else that the lady had been fascinated
by our wondrous personal beauty, but it turned
out that she was losing her balanca and had clung
to us for support. “I beg pardon,” she gasped,
and slithered away to a seat. This she reached
in safety, but when she turned to sit down, tho
skates shot from under her, depositing her in an
ugly heap on the floor. We moved away sadly to
the refreshment-room, but even there “the
villain still pursued us.” Parties use! to skate in
there on refreshment bent, and miscalculating
their pace would oomo flying in, scattering chairs
and small tables in all directions, and bring up
with an awful smash against the counter, yelling
out, “ Two teas at d a roll! ” as they went to their
doom. This got monotonous, so we returned to
the festive throng just in time to see one of the
learners get the most awful “ crumpler ” ; then
he jumped up suddenly right In front of a
very good skater who was swinging along behind
him, and down they both went again with
mutual wrath. Then a fat girl and her young
man who were skating hand in hand went to
howling inevitable destruction-over them. This
diverted us until the ringing of a small bell an-
nounced that the procession was to be formed,
consisting of ladies and gentlemen skating in
couples. After much trouble they were mar-
shalled and glided away, going through some very
pretty evolutions. Seme gentlemen could not get
ladies and skated alone, but these were ruthlessly
expelled by the presiding official. “Where’s your
lady ? ” we heard him say to one of those lonely
skaters. “ Pell down ” was the laconic and un-
truthful reply. “Go and pick her up again or
else knock off” was the stern decision. Of those
present some skated beautifully and the great
majority got along easily and gracefully. A
heavy fall is a rare occurrence. Very often people
forget that they are on skates, and go to lean
against one of the posts, and away go their feet
and down they come. We understand that a rink
is to be formed at Double Bay, to which—alas !
only the elite will be admitted. It is thus that
grovelling social distinctions are allowed to un«
dermine the welfare of a Democratic community.

We have a bone to pick with Mr. Thigofaka
Shiga, analyst on board the Japanese ship which
anchored in our Beautiful Harbour a year or so
back. Since his return to bosom of
his family, Mr. Thigefakahas been making action-
able remarks about some of our old mashes. He
said “the only Japanese to be seen in Australia
were those at the Japanese Village, in Sydney.
That village was supplied with the lowest
creatures of the most uncivilised class of Japanese,
and showed customs which we were asMmed to
see.” That for Thigefaka 1 (at this juncture we
lay down the weary pen and snap our fingers in
disdaia). Nothing shall persuade us that tha
syrens who dispensed expansive smiles and micro-
scopical cups of tea were “lowest creatures.’


The manager of the Village assured us that all his
ladies were duchesses in their own country, and
nearly related to the blessed Mikado himself. As
for their customs—well, they were charming girls
When yeti met them out of an evening. Our
faith in the simple Village maidens is proof
against the innuendoes of a million Thigefakas.

presided at the Police Court, instead of taking up
valuable space and using type that can’t be easily
spared in attaching handles to the names of those

Down at Shepparton (Vic.) excitement is

The promoters of the proposed eight-oar

Mr. George Seale will be in it, even as emergency.

Tommy Hales is retained permanently for
the matrimonial stakes ; he is now running in
double-harness. His wife hails from S.A., and is
a daughter to Mr. Blackler, of Fulham Park,
Adelaide. The marriage was solemnised in Mel-
bourne, and the bridesmaids wore the Hon. J.
White’s colours, there now. Tommy’s latest
engagement may be said to have been a steeple-
chase, which eventuated in a tie —that is, if you
don't mind.

The landlord of the Albion Hotel, Mel-
bourne, doesn’t dote upon Tasmanian footballers
to any marked extent. He boarded and lodged
them for a night or two, and then offered their
manager a receipted bill on condition that the
“ Tasmanian devils ” cleared out. Perhaps Van
Dieman’s Land was the better name, after all.

An Age advertisement: “ Wanted, ener-

of the Graeco-Roman sort —a fact of which the ad-
vertisers seem not altogether unaware.

We are sorry to hear that Professor
Miller’s father died last Saturday. The Profes-
sor’s heart is as large as the rest of him, and the
old gentleman’s death hurt him more than a
dozen wrestling matches. Miller, senior, by the
way, who was almost as muscular as his son, was
at one time a noted* swordsman in France, He
was musically inclined, and laboured under an
amiable delusion that he was “ Australia's only
basso.” He was a tutor by profession.
Running a newspaper does not appear to
be a money-making game in Maoriland. It is
stated on good authority that not more than half-
a-dozen New Zealand newsgrinders earn more
than salt for their porridge out of their dailies and
weeklies. As an illustration of the uncertainty of
journalistic ventures in the “ land of the Maori
and Moa” we may instance the case of Tom
Bracken, ex-M.P., who recently “ filed his shovel ”
in Dunedin. Thirteen years ago, Tom started the
once popular Saturday Advertiser, and since
that time he has paid in newspaper “ calls"
many and many a hundred pounds. It is
not to he wondered at that the depressed
times should have forced the versatile Thomas to
shut up shop for the time being, nor is it astonish-
ing that his creditors in meeting assembled should
have passed a resolution expressive of sympathy
with him in bis financial troubles, coupled with a
recommendation for his immediate discharge.
Tom’s constituents of Dunedin Central do not ap-
pear to have their confidence in him shaken by
his failure, for no sooner did the popular journalist
receive his “ clean sheet ” from the assignee than
they requisitioned him to stand for his old seat, bub
Thomas declined the honour.

Legal joke. In Sydney District Court the
other day, Mr. Levy, of Kurts celebrity, was
arguing a legal point with a brother practitioner.
The dispute waxed hot, and Mr. Levy’s opponent
finally settled the matter by remarking : “ Well,
Levy, you might admit that for me out of
Kurtsey.” Whereupon Mr. Levy snorted a great
snort.

Mud J. Haynes intends to move in the

country.
Premier Parkes has made another move
towards Protection. He now declares that the
N.S.W. farmers “should be dealt with not under
the pressure of any rigid lines of equity." This
assertion has made the D.T. sit up and howl for
the stamping out of intersessional junketing, as it
the country champagne, and not the irresistible
advance of the Protectionist idea, was responsible
for the remark.
The Victorian Chief Justice has summoned

an honest workman’s hammer jars on ears accus-
tomed to the tones of the man who lies for a living.

is incalculable by anyone of less mighty genius
than Cobden Cocky Burns, Esq.

fII HE youth who bore the banners with the
strange device and the boy who stood on the
burning deck were both a trifle off. St. Jacobs
oil is an article of faith with thousands who never
put their names to testimonial, hut if they were
asked would do so without hesitation.
It is simply the most wonderful remedy the
world has ever seen for the immediate relief and
cure of rheumatism, neuralgia, and all painful
diseases. Its remarkable action has mystified
doctors, delighted sufferers, and dispelled the
doubts of the most incredulous. Its virtues are
praised by thousands all over the land, who have
been rescued from years of suffering and torture
with every species of disease, and granted a new
lease of health and activity. When physicians
have certified to their inability to cure rheu-
matism, neuralgia, and other very painful dis-
orders by giving up their patients to the stubborn
claims of protracted disease and possible death it-
self, the St. Jacobs oil, by its unpretentious merit,
has gained in every instance yet greater fame
from its almost magical influence over these
diseases. This remedy has no uncertain or
miraculous history ; its decided power resides in a
peculiar volatile oil, carefully distilled from the
Pinus Sylvestris, and has been used and dis-
tributed for hundreds of years by the inhabitants
of the Black Forest, a mountainous and densely-
wooded region in Baden and Wurtemburg, Ger-
many. The introduction of the St. Jacobs oil into
Australia has been attended with the same dis-
tinguished results as have ever characterised its
employment in America and Europe; and its
adoption ns the National remedy for rheumatism,
neuralgia, and all painful diseases is assured.
When it is considered that this wonderful pain-
banisher and health-restorer can be had at all drug
stores for such a small sum, it appears as a matter
of duty to every sufferer with rheumatism, neu-
ralgia, or kindred complaints to seek the relief
which St. Jacobs oil cannot fail to give. Try it
and you will be convinced. It can be obtained
from Messrs. Feldheim, Gotthelf, and Co., S. Hoff-
nung and Co., John Frazer and Co., Mason Bros
and Co., D. Mitchell and Co., Myers and Solomon,
George Griffiths and Co., Australian Drug Com-
pany, Elliott Bros, and Co., limited, and retail
from all chemists and druggists.
SYMPATHY.
FromtheENTERTAINMENT’GAZETTE AND ECHOES
of THE Week of July 9 last we take the following
expression of brotherly sympathy by Mr. George
Augustus Sala for his friend Mr. Yates (Atlas) of
The World ;
I fully sympathise with my friend Mr. Yates,
who tells his readers this week that, happening to
alight from his hanson on his way to the Guildhall
Ball, he got jammed in a crowd, from which he
with difficulty extricated himself, and when he
did reach Guildhall found, when he unbuttoned
his cape in the vestiare, that he had been robbed
of his watch. The horologe had cost, I learn from
another source, 10 guineas. This comes of being
haughty, Mr. Yates, and wearing chronometers
jewelled in many holes, and riding in hansom cabs
and such like. My own name is Old Artful, j
left my watch at home, and my overcoat to boot,
on the night of the ball; and the Commissioners
of City Police kindly allowed my humble four-
wheeler to stand in the old Jewry, hard by Guild-
hall, so that I had not the slightest difficulty in
getting there or in getting away to work, which
was not over until 2 in the morning. Oh, the
Jubilee ! the Jubilee I
Mr. Yates goes onto say that for the future
the pickpockets shall have reason to say of him
Cantdbit vacuus coram latrone viator-, and that
henceforward he will eschew expensive watches
and wear a Waterbury. Proud sir! you should
have taken to a Waterbury watch long ago.
I wore mine own (cost me ten and sixpence) at
first compulsorily. You see that I had a rather
handsome gold watch by Leroy, of the Palais
Royal—an eight hundred franc watch; but it is at
present in the keeping of Uncle Richard, who is
pssslonately fond of articles of virtu, and politely
declines to part with my timekeeper untii a
ridiculous process called “ redemption” is gone
through. But ere long I learned to love my
Waterbury watch. It keeps such excellent time
and ticks so sympathetically.
Mem.: Waterbury, where these watches are
made, is, I infer, in Connecticut, U.S, a. The
only Waterbury that I persona ly know is in the
State of Vermont, seven miles from Montpelier,
and a few miles from the fashionable summer re-
sort, Stowe. There is some of the prettiest
mountain scenery in the world round about the
Vermont Waterbury.
A misguided Wesleyan minister at Rock-
hampton (Q.) is getting himself disliked by the
local alleged Christians. He says that the
“Escaped Nun’s” lectures will not promote
brotherly feeling among the churches. We here
giye his reverence a pinch for stale news.
The native trackers employed to run down
Hughes, the reman tic W. A. convict were pri-
soners themselves. During the bustle and excite-
ment of the capture, however, these individuals,
loth to return ta captivity, decamped into the
wilderness.
Melbourne Argus hasn’t got off this time.
Mopping up Madden and Purves didn’t avail, and
so they’ll have to “ part” £250 to Rocke, Tomp-
sitt, and Co,, the druggists. The plaintiffs en-
gaged the careful and clever Hood, perhaps as an
expert, his father having been a chemist in Eliza-
beth-street. The Argus said that under the
name of “sheepwash” certain stuff had been
consigned to R., T., and Co. which might send a
ship to the hereafter.

An interesting discovery was made the
other day by Mr. George Billson, of Chetwynd
(Vic.), while engaged in felling a tree on hiafarm.
Just underneath the outer bark he discovered the
name “ Mitchell" carved in the wood, followed
by a date which ia unfortunately decipherable.
There ia little room, however, for doubting that
the inscription was intended to mark one of Major
Mitchell’s camping places when he made his
memorable journey of exploration through Aus-
tralia Felix, in 1836,
The Melbourne Age calls the Pall Mall
Gazette, “ That terror of well-placed sinners.”
From the S.M. Herald ;—“ Wanted, an
Office and 3or 1 flats, central. W. J. P.”
We don’t know of an office that’s to let,
But we can point him out four flats, you het I!
The Midas mine at Sulky Gully, Dowling
Forest, (Vic.), where the monster nugget weigh-
ing 511 b. was found lasi week, has an interesting
history, la the early days of Victorian gold-min-
ing, Sulky Gully was one of the most profitable
fields for shallow-sinking in Australia, audit was
no uncommon thing for the wash-dirt to give
450 z. to the load. When the claims on Crown
lands had all been worked out it was proposed to
drive into the late W. J. T. Clarke’s Dowling
Forest estate, which lay to the eastward, by
force ; but finally it was arranged that an in-
terview should take place between the diggers
and the landowner. An impromptu platform
was frmed out of a barrel, and when “ Big
Clarke mounted the rostrum the head caved in
(not accidentally either). The old man was so
hurt both as to hia feelinga and his shins that he
would never renew the negotiations for permis-
sion to mine upon hia property, though he was
offered £IOOO for a lease of the ground now occu-
pied by the Midas mine. When “Big Clarke"
died, and his son, Sir William, reigned in his
stead, a few speculators obtained a lease of the
ground from him, but it was with the greatest
difficulty that a few hundred pounds were sub-
scribed to start operations. Several very large
nuggets have already been found in ihe mine, the
value of the last being £2600.
THE fourth chapter, and end of our self-imposed
task. It has been a duty undertaken on
account of those who have so long encouraged us
with their support. It was last Saturday we com-
menced the essay, and we pledged our reputation
to continue it, chapter by chapter, until we had
thoroughly exhausted the subject. We thought
three chapters would have sufficed, but find it
takes four.
Last Saturday’s issue saw the first part of our
essay upon HOW AND WHERE TO FURNISH
THOROUGHLY, S AFELYand E OONOMICALLY;
and in that issue, as the result of serious study
and careful deliberation we gave our readers a
the Carpet and Floorcloth floors upon
the sth storey of the Great Cantral Emporium,
Sydney.
We omitted giving the address in the first issue,
but do so now, viz., LAWLER'S, 608 George"
street, Sydney. An old-established house, es-
tablished as long ago as 1860, and situate in the
centre of the city right between Liverpool and
Bathurst streets. A commanding and imposing
edifice, and stocked from floor to ceiling
Monday’s issue treated of the extraordinary
stock of bedsteads, wire-mattresses and bedding,
upon the floor of the Ith storey; and Wednesday’s
issue dealtexclusively with the Bedroom Furniture
upon the floors of the 3rd storey. And now we
have to treat of the Dining and Drawing room
furniture and Library and Ofilce appointments
upon the floors of the 2nd storey.
This last chapter is the one that claims the at-
tention of our readers, and we will be as brief but
explanatory as possible. LAWLER S Suites differ
from most suites met with in Sydney houses, and
remind us on account of their solidity and fulness
of upholstery of the suites made before the age for
slop upholstery became general.
We have had our attention called to a magnifi-
cent solid walnut diningroom suite with misletoe
carvings and carved and moulded legs set with
best coppered wire springs, upholstered throughout
in curled horsehair, and covered in the best
Russian dressed real morocco, finished with
morocco binding and morocco-covered studs. The
suite was made for one of our well-known mer-
chant princes and was sold to him for £65. It
looked all out well worth 1)0 guineas, a figure one
of the furnishing salesmen declared he had re-
peatedly sold the suites at in London, Leeds and
Edinburgh. There is another Suite just being
completed in the factory, the couch and a few
chair.- of which we were shown, and we have no
hesitation in declai ing it to be the best upholstered
suite we have ever seen. No one with money
could resist it. It is a glorious suite, splendidly
finished and boldly conceived, and only £6O. It
would be cheap at £BO. We felt bound to admit
that it was stupid purchasing at auction sales
when LAWLER’S celebrated light oak or walnut
or real mahagony specialty—the Emporium
Leather Suite at £27 10s., could be had direct
from the factories In Union-lane. There are
Diningroom Suites a’.l made and upholstered upon
the premises in oak, walnut or Mahogany, and in
crimson or olive Utrecht velvets at £2l 10s. and
£7 10s. And there are mahogany and cedar
Diningroom Suites in the best English made hair-
cloth, or In Cockett’s maroon or green-colored
leather-cloth at £l2 .Os., £ll 10s. and £l7. LAW-
LER’S set their face against turning out suites in
hair cloth at anything less than £l2 10s., saying
they would only have to resort to common German-
made seating i( they were to manufacture hair-
cloth suites at a penny less than £l2 10s.
Our readers ought all to bear in mind the im-
portant fact that they can select their Lames at
LAWLER’S and choose whatever covering they
think fit, and can call rbund at any time and see
the work in the upholsterer’s hands.
We would remind those who prefer the Austrian
Suites to upholstered Suites that they can have
one of those grand and hrxurious Couches, the
Eugenie, at £3 19a., and capitally suited for an
after-dinner smoke or nap they are. Long and
broad —a perfect nest of spiral springs, the head as
well as the seat being so upholstered.
This Eugenie Couch of LAWLER’S, at £3 19s. is
a perfect marvel of value, and to show the esteem
in which it is held we have only to remark that
since LAWLER reduced the price from £5 ss. to
to £3 19a , the present low price—since he reduced
ihe Eugenics to £3 19s. he has sold 200 and odd of
them, or an average of five a week.
We have no intention of referring to Sideboards
or Dinner Waggons; nor were we inclined to take
up much of our important Saturday's space with
Extending and Telescopic Dining Tables, buthaving
been shown a few very special lines we think it
our duty to name them.
Frst there is the Hotel Sideboard, 6ft. long, with
glass back, bracket shelf, enclosed cupboards and
drawers, all solid cedar, price £8 10s. Then there
is the Cottage Sideboard, with large glass back,
cellarette cupboard and drawer enclosed, brackets
for ornaments, &c., &c., £ll 10s. and £l2 10s
There are Cottage Sideboards at £3 15s. and £5
ss. And for mansions a range of best made Side-
boards in walnut, oak and mahogany at £l7 10s ,
£25, £27 10s., £35. Thera are massive Sideboards
in pollard oak with all the latest improvements,
of bold design, faithfully built, with immense
bevelled glass back, collarettes, &c., &c., at £45.
Bookcases and Cylinder Writing Desks in oak,
walnut and mahogany. Dinner Waggons, in the
same woods.
A grand stock of elegaht Pierglasses and Over-
mantels
But what surprised us most was the quantity
of Drawingroom Furniture, Suites, Cabinets,
Brackets, Tables, &c, turned out by LAWLER’S.
The turn-over of the establishment with its
different departments, its wonderful Boot and
Shoe floor, the Furniture, Carpets and Bedsteads,
the Ironmongery and Glass and China, the Drapery
and Clothing and Hats and Caps must be some-
thing extraordinary.
Upwards of 400 Drawingroom Suites turned
out in 12 months, and ranging in quality, style
and price from the simple but serviceable Repp
Suites at £lO 10s. to the prettiest and mosj
effective Occasional and Harlequin Suites in
Parisian tapestries or plushes at £45.
As in Diningroom Suites, LAWLER'S will not
turn out anything under £l2 10s, so with
Drawingroom Suites, they will not touch any-
thing under £lO 10s. LAWLER’S hold that the
customer who pays more than £65 for the pro-
duction of the best of Morocco Dining-room Suites,
or above £SO for the loveliest and most charming
of delighful special things in Drawingroom Suites
deserves to be declared a “Tittlebat Titmouse”
and fit prey for high-toned but unprincipled
furnishing ‘ Oily Gammons.” And we think so,
too.
Time and space—that is newspaper space—i
pretty much like time and tide, will wait for
none; so that, although we would like to refer
to Cabinets. Whatnots, Music Canterburys and
a thousand other articles, we are compelled to end
our essay by repeating at its close the words with
which we commenced—viz., that the place at
which to furnish safely, surely, thoroughly,
economically and well is
