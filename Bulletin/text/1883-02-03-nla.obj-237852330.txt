" Saturday, febeuaky 3, isss.
,„. T was a candid confession by a correspondent
VtL Sydney Morning Herald, which was
°Lnted and repeated editorially by the Echo,
sales of land by auction have been the
'Matter’s weapon for parrying free-selection. No
n« will deny the accuracy of the definition, and
> may even be conceded, with some reservations
lhat the Echo is right in declaring the cessation
nf auction sales, without simultaneous suspension
nf free-seleotion, to be an injustice. The reserva-
tions to be made are, however, very important.
It was certainly never intended that auction sales
should operate as a frustration of the law of free-
aflloction, yet that has been precisely their effect.
A right to select freely, anywhere throughout the
knds under pastoral lease throughout the colony,
i§ an illusion —a mere Will o -the-Wisp when
oounteraoted in every direction by withdrawals of
the choicest areas—for sale to the highest bidder,
or for so-called reserves, placed at the service of
the run-holder. The land system, of which Sir
John .Robertson is the author, ostensibly pro-
vided the right of unrestricted selection. The
nrovision permitting of sales by auction was pro-
fessedly thrown in merely to meet exceptional
contingencies. In practice, it has been so worked
as to put a complexion upon the whole system
nuite at variance with the original declarations,
and we are free to believe, intention of its author.
The’ aim of fcir John’s system was to rapidly
substitute the settler for the lessee. The squatter
was to make way for the selector. But, by a
corruption of the administrative opportunities
afforded by what at first seemed a subordinate
and insignificant clause, in deference to the
political, financial, and social pressure exercised
by the powerful classes interested in the mainte-
nance and perpetuation of large holdings, the
essence of Sir John’s legislation has been dis-
solved away; and, instead of universal subdivision
of the land among a numerous resident body of
working settlers, the predominant effect of the
law has been to stimulate wholesale purchases of
vast areas in fee-simple by wealthy persons—
previously leaseholders, or by banks and other
money-lending institutions, either directly or
working behind speculators.
• • •
By this device the character and operation of
the law has been so essentially perverted, without
itself evoking any expression of objection or sur-
prise from Sir John, that it is only by an exertion
of faith—which we are told by theologians is the
evidence of things not seen —that credit can be
allowed to Sir John for the genuineness of his
original declarations. For over twenty years now,
he has silently assented to the effectual and
thorough perversion of the nominal drift of his
system; and it may not unreasonably be argued
on these grounds that the Land laws have been
administered in accordance with the intention ot
their framers, and that, consequently, to restore
them by a simple exercise of departmental autho-
rity to their merely nominal and supposititious
original operation, is a monstrous assumption and
an act of injustice. But, believing as we do, that
Sir John honestly intended that his free-seleotion
lands should really break up the old big leaseholds
and distribute the lands among a resident yeoman
proprietory, who would by physical labour and intel-
ligent industry increase the productiveness of the
territory, the abuse of administrative functions
has not been to-day in stopping wholesale auctions,
but heretofore in permitting such a device to
nullify the genuine purpose of the law. At the
same time it maybe admitted that there is a real
hardship to persons who have based their dealings
in pastoral estates on the custom of twenty years
a custom, moreover, not challenged by the author
ot the agrarian system —in suddenly reverting to
the direct and simple interpretation of the law.
• • *
The duty of an Administration is, however, to
give effect to the law's according to their plain and
honest interpretation. A bad perversion of a good
law gains no immunity from antiquity. The longer
such a provision has endured, the greater has been
the wrong inflicted upon the community the
more urgent has become the necessity tor
restoring it to its pristine integrity. If this can
be effected by a stroke of a Minister s pen, he
should avail himself of bis opportunity. The in-
justice, if there beany, is not chargeable on him,
but upon those among bis predecessor s whose
habitual distortion of the laws had created an
impression that the particular enactments would
never be administered in the spirit in which they
were framed. In considering the action of the
present Government, in peremptorily restoring
laws for the encouraging settlement to their
original channels, it must be borne in mind that
this is in entire consonance with the professions
with which they assumed office, and tha* - their
course is an earnest of sincerity. They cannot
but perceive, that by lopping off the great branch
of income heretofore derived from realisation of
the colony’s capital—the land, they are preparing
trouble for themselves as a Cabinet. They im-
pose upon themselves an immediate necessity for
one of three alternatives. They must economise
by cutting down expenditure —so lavish under the
system of their predecessors. Or they must in-
crease taxation. Either of these expedients in-
volves an assured loss of popularity, or, at best,
of support from influential coteiies whose members
have fattened upon the prodigality of previous
Administrations. Their third alternative is to
obtain authority to float a loan of sufficient
amount to prevent too sudden a drop in the scale
of government expenditure.
• • *
Despite the ill-effects of _ the failure of
the Victorian loan, it is quite possible that
the British capitalist may recognise the fact
that a colony which has ceased to dissi-
pate its patrimony in real estate, is in better
countenance for borrowing than while it was burn-
ing the candle at both ends. But on the other
hand, there can be no question that efforts will be
made by unprincipled politicians, with an unsated
hunger for office, to put the worst construction
upon such an expedient, should it bo attempted.
Moreover, the various banks and mortgage
companies are generally deeply concerned in
the continuation of auction sales, in order
to consolidate their securities; and these or-
ganizations can powerfully influence the minds
of the moneyed classes in the old country.
So that even this resource is hedged
round with many difficulties for the Govern-
ment. Even were it to, it could
scarcely avert the necessity for having recourse to
one of the former alternatives. It has been so
Ion? the habit of preceding administrations to
treat funds obtained by parting with territory as
though these were legitimate revenue, and
permanent source of income, that the expenditure
of the State has outgrown all proportion to the
real and proper yearly receipts. There has been
a so-called surplus for some years back, but that
surplus has invariably been manufactured out of
the receipts from auction sales, and has neTer
been more than a fraction of the sums so derived.
Jjy surrendering, in pursuance of principle, that
source of money-getting, the Ministry converts a
surplus into a deficit, a proceeding which may
gain for them the respect and approval of the more
thoughtful and intelligent among the colonists, but
which is none the less likely to be used against
them as an evidence, not of foresight, prudence,
and principle, but of incapacity, by auchof their
political antagonists as make it their business to
trade upon the ignorance and prejudices of the
many, without consideration of principle or regard
for the true interests of the people.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Parkes versus Renwick.
The completeness of Dr. Berwick's political ruin may
be understood by the attitude assumed by Sir Hewet
Paekes towards him. The late Minister for Mines is
evidently regarded by the astute ex-Premier as dead
broke. Ho has been allotted the fate which has
befallen all the human tools which Paekes, after using,
found no longer serviceable. That is to say, he has
been flung contemptuously on one side, with a callous
indifference to the service rendered by him, and to the
fact that human tools have feelings. Sir Hbnet
Paekes, who is an excellent and cold-blooded judge,
has evidently made np his mind that from Dr. Ben-
wick as a politician there is nothing more to be gained,
and nothing to be feared. So the feeble cx-Mlnister,
having served his turn, is flung aside, making only one
addition to a long list of individuals who have been
similarly treated by Sir Henry Parkes. We have
very slight pity for the Doctor, whoso suppleness and
servility appear to have merited no better fate. But
his demerits furnish sleuder excuse for the cold-
blooded sacrifice made of him by his late
chief and confederate. Sir Henry Parkes’ denial
I, hat Dr. Eenwick had ever expressed his dissent
rom the Government Land Bill in the Cabinet is not
somprchcnsive enough to servo as a contradiction o£
,he Doctor’s assertions with reference to the distaste
){ himself. Sir Henry Parses, and some; other
Ministers, to the Land Bill they subsequently tried to
ram down the throats of the Assembly and the con,
stituencies. Dr. Eenwick had not specified that his
objections or thoso of Sir Henry and other Ministers
had been urged in Cabinet Council. It remains for Sir
Henry Parkes therefore to generalize his denials, and
state distinctly whether it is not true that in a non
committing conversational sort of way ho and other
Ministers had unfavourably commented upon Sir John
Eobertson’s insistance upon his agrarian policy. If
this be true, then it is difficult to understand how Sir
Henry was justified in charging Dr. Eenwick with
dishonourable conduct in divulging what had trens-
pired in the Executive Council. Sir Henry either
loads his late colleague with the double infamy
of pretending falsely to divulge what were ficti-
tious conversations in Cabinet, or in himself
chargeable with the infamy of ascribing to an
ex-colleague dishonorable conduct which he did
not commit. If nothing of the kind allegojl oc*
curred in Council, but did happen in familiar and
intimate conversation, how is Dr. Eenwick chargeable
with the dishonour of disclosing Cabinet consultation".
On the other hand, if nothing of the kind transpired in
or out of Council, and neither Sir Henry nor any
other ministers had exchanged with Dr. Eenwick con-
fidences as to their dislike for their land bill. Dr.
Eenwick is placed in the position of a man who has
concocted or forged a bogus confession to save himself
at the expense of his friends’ disgrace. Evidently,
somebody has lied desperately, and with no other
object than to save himself at the cost of his ex-
colleague’s ruin. Dr. Eenwick, being the earthen
pipkin, will, no daubt, be the worst broken up. Ha
has evinced, it is true, a singular incapacity to compre-
bend what principle signifies, but we are by no means
clear that in this particular episode he is not more
sinned against than sinning.
The Mission to the Newtown Heathen.
The Eev. Mr. Tatloe, of Newtown, is a curious sort
of Christian, if his own writings may be accepted as a
criterion. Having denounced Mr. Copeland as “ an
atheist,” and evoked from him the retort that, al-
though for years a pew-renter in Mr. Tatloe s church,
that Father-in-GoD had never made a single attempt to
convert him, Mr. Tatloe explains that Mr. Copeland
had been visited regularly once a quarter by “ tha
curate,” and that if he has not been at home it is not
his—the Rev. Mr. Tatloe’s—fault. It appears, there-
fore, that while Mr. Tatloe receives Mr. Copeland’s
contributions to his income, in person, he ministers to
that “lost sheep” by deputy. Mr. Tatloe probably
reads his Bible backwards, and makes it his motto that
his mission is to call the righteous, not sinners, to
repentance. Mr. Copeland was, as a pew-renter, a
member of Mr. Tatloe’s flock; and Mr. Tatloe be-
lieved him to he “an atheist,” and, therefore, more
than any member of that flock, unless it contained an
extraordinary percentage ®f “atheists,” in mortal
peril, and in need of spiritual ministrations and of
conversion. The means adopted by the rev. pastor for
effecting this desirable object have been, on his own
showing, to send a curate once a quarter to pay a
morning call at Mr. Copeland’s residence, and tako
the chance whether he was at home or absent. This
process of carrying the light of the Gospel to the
heathen, by leaving a card for him once every two or
three months, may be an effective discharge of sacred
duty. Wo don’t say it is not. But if it is, how can
air. Tatloe conscientiously appeal to his congregation
for collections for missionaries in the South Seas, who
have such absurdly extravagant ideas of what is
requisite, that, instead of leaving a card once a quarter
on the heathen, they live among them.
Buchanan and “A Worthy Man”
Mr. David Buchanan, one of the members for
Mudgee, is well-known as, among other characters, a
great stickler for the pur.ty of the Courts of Justice.
Just prior to the resignation of the Parkes-Eobeutbon
Government, a terrible blow was dealt to Mr. Buchanan
by what he terms “ infamous treatment of a worthy
man." The infamous treatment which roused the fires
of indignation in Mr. Buchanan's virtuous breast was
the removal from the roll of Justices of the Peace, by a
writ of supercedeas, of a Mr. Zimmerman, who had
been elevated to that bench in deference to Mr.
Buchanan s repeated recommendations and sslicita-
,tioQS. Mr. Zimmerman was recommended by Mr.
Buchanan on the ground that ho was not only "a
worthy man,” but “ an intelligent and well-educated
man," “ an intelligent man of high character," and ‘‘a
most respectable man of high character. This
Buchananic paragon might still be doing justice on

the judgment seat, but for the operation of the only
cheek which seems effectual to protect the colonists of
N. S. Wales from wrongs. The Gulgong People's
Advocate libelled the “respectable man of high
character,” by ascribing to him proceedings of a deci-
dedly Clontarfy nature. The worthy man, of course,
appealed to the protection of the law. As one of its
administrators, he naturally reckoned on sympathetic
treatment And he got damages, the dimages of eliciting
public testimony to the effect that he had frequently
been seen drunk in public, and using obscene language.
And those were all the damages he got, save that a
local petition was numerously signed requesting inquiry
as to his fitness for magisterial functions. On official
inquiry, the objections against the respectable man’s
character were fully sustained, and the late Govern-
ment removed him. Now, Buchanan is indignant at
this “outrage upon a worthy man.” We pause, and
speculate how many “worthy respectable men"
have been appoin'ed to administer justice, on recom-
mendatious of individuals who could not secure a hom
Me recommendation in these terms for themselves.
The Y.M.C.A.
We like piety -hot-pie-ty. But wo don’t like sniffling’,
psalmy piety. Wo can’t see the use of it. Take now
the annual report of the Young Men’s Christian Asso-
ciation. This Society is vaguely supposed by mildly
virtuous people to do a great deal of good. Here is the
amount it has done in twelve months, according to its
own showingHeld prayer-meetings and lectures, en-
gaged in conversation and prayer 650 times, distributed
tracts, visited sick young men mgaol (We would like to
know if these young men were members of the Y.M.C. A.
before they got into gaol, or became so after. By the
way, they didn't come to see us !) distributed tracts,
helped 45 to situations, engaged in prayer, distributed
tracts, gave 200 introductions to merchants and others
(as only 45 got situations, it is to be presumed the in-
troduction damned the rest), distributed 20,450 tracts
and 93,000 slips and hand-bills-and collected nearly
eleven thousand pounds. There is a considerable amount
of prayer and tract distribution to a very small quantity
of solid charity about this account of a year's work.
But the holy promoters did not fail to lay their hands
Upon the lucre for all that. They never do. We will
not condemn them in a hurry, however. Perhaps they
made up in moral what they omitted in acts of prac-
tical good. If they did wo want to see the fruit—we
want to see the young men who will not tell a lie, who
will not defraud their employers, who will not use
Mithy language. who will not get drunk, who will not
injure one another to benefit themselves ; and, in fact,
who will mate an honest effort never to do anything
wrong. We don’t see them in the Y.M C.A , anyhow.
Maybe they stay at home a good deal, and go to prayer-
meetings the rest of the time, under which circum-
stances it is not surprising that we don’t see them
We don’t believe in the Y M.C A. And for this reason :
The young man who can be turned from evil ways by
Binging psalms and “engaging in conversation and
prayer" with fat, old, frog-brained fossils, has so little
evil ia him that ho will never have any good. Saints
are not made out of molluscs.
Contempt of Court.
It is a curious instance of tho manner in which lawyers
hive at all times managed to have laws so framed as o
suit their own guild, that in communities under
British rule a Judge has authority which is expli-
citly denied to tho Sovereign. Even a little Colonial
Judge-possibly scrambled on to the bench by “ leading”
money to a needy and unscrupulous Pjemier—can exert
power which not the whole Executive Council, not the
Governor, not even the Queen herself were sbe here,
has the right to exercise. The wretch who snaps a
pistol in the face of the Queen can claim a trial; bu
the offender who snaps his fingers in the face of a
Judge commits an outrage so greatly worse that by the
act he forfeits every civil and constitutional right, and
may be condemned to imprisonment without trial or
appeal. But to snap the fingers is an overt act, and no
overt act is requisite to render a man liable to condem-
nation for contempt of court. And, be it noted, this is
the only offence with respect to which accusation and
condemnation are convertible terms. The accuser is
the judge also. Jury there is none. A man
may be sentenced for a contempt he has not
even felt, let alone expressed. There is no definition
of the offence, which may range from biting one's
thumb to throwing one's shoe ; and in practice actually
includes failure to pay moneys, ns ordered by a
judge, which a man does not possess, and could only
acquire by robbery or fraud. The anomaly of the
whole affair has just been prominently forced into
notibe in England, by the imprisonment of Mr. Qeet,
M.P. The Imperial Parliament has, in consequence,
not on’y appointed a committee to investigate the
question, but has absolutely promised to bring in a
Bill, next session, to limit and define the power of
Judges in this respect. Considering that in this small
community a man may climb up to the Judgment Heat
by the soiled rungs of the political ladder, or by com-
plaisanoes to men in power, and without any regard
for moral or intellectual fitness, it is certainly a glaring
anomaly that the right to imprison without trial and
without limit of time should be vested in our Judges.
Secondary School.
Is spite of the opposition which Mr. Reid’s proposal to
convert St. James’ School into a High School for both
sexes has excited in certain mostly interested (quarters,
it is moat sincerely to be hoped that Mr. Reid will not
ad’ow himself to be overruled or dissuaded from this
project. The need for such an Institution is great, not
only in Sydney, but in the chief country towns. At
present, if a parent is ambitious of giving his son a
superior education, he has little recourse except to
private “ Classical and Commercial Schools," which, in
the majority of ca‘es, are unmitigated frauds, where,
for a couple of year 1 :, a lad is put under a certain loose
and stupid drill, and whence he emerges more or less
perfect in “vocables," as Caultle would put it, but
hazy and undetermined as to the meaning and use of
those vocables. With girls, the case has been worse .
for, in the sphere of female education, there being fewer
competitors, there is more chance for mediocrity
Accordingly, in Sydney at least, wo find mediocrity
rules the roast. Now we are promised an institution
where both boys and girls suited for the higher educa-
tion can get it. There are, at the outset, two matters
whieh must be considered well, or failure will certainly
supervene— namely: the examination for matriculation,
and the curriculum. If the examination for admission
be too easy, the school will be flooded with youths who e
needs would, for a time, be met at the primary school;
iH too hard, the school will languish for want of scholars.
Then, as to the curriculum, a further danger besets the
Minister, for, if it be too wide, we shall have cram, not
culture; if too restricted, the legitimate seeds of the
you h may be unsatisfied. And, in relation to the ouni-
oulum for the Girls’ High School, let the Minister for
Educatitn remember, what many parents seem to for-
get, that the vocation of 99 out of 100 girls is to be wives
and mothers, not elegantly dressed ladies in a drawing-
room only. We have in these columns advocated time
after time the establishment of thtse High Schools,
especially for girls; and it is sincerely to be hoped that
Mr. Keid will seek all possible information on this sub'
ject before he commits his department to an experimeut
which, according to its success or failure, will satisfy or
thwatt the real need. It is better to wait for our High
Schools than to have inefiicient schools. As to the ex-
tension of High Schools to the country, it is easy to see
that, for the sake of efficiency, it will be impossible to
found such institutions in small country towns.
A "Too-Weak” Opposition.
Tee Queenslanders, like ourselves, have had a strong
Government in office during several consecutive years
But, contrary to the conditions under which our too
strong Administration existed, it seems to be the
peop’e in Queensland who are content with the
Ministry, and a strong political body which objects to
its use of power. In our case, the Government was
maintained in power by a strong political coterie, and
date*ted by the people. Mr. Griffith, the leader oi
the Queensland Opposition, has dogged every move oi
Ministers with an untiring activity, but to what extent
he has succeeded, during all these years, in working
up an antagonism in the minds of the populace, is not
quite apparent. As a matter of fact, he has not been
afforded many chances by his remarkably able chiei
adversary. Sir Thomas MTlwraith is not merely a
dexterous political manager; he is a man of real con-
structive talent, and of an aptitude for finance which
approaches genius. Thus, while he docs not neglect
to tickle the small vanities of individuals iu the fashion
which constitutes the whole political talent of sire.e
men who have made a considerable name, he inflames
the imagination and excites the admiration of the
colonis's ever and anon by some bold combination oi
brilliant project. Mr Griffith has, however, had the
advantage of being able to work upon an instinct of
popular repugnance. The MTlwraith Cabinet is dis-
tinctly favourable to coloured labour for tropical plan-
tations. The mass of working men in the colony are
instinctively opposed to anything of the kind; and
Mr. Griffith has played upon this one of their heart-
strings very industriously. But an artist who plays
only on one string, while his rival plays on half-a-
dojen, is liable to become monotonous, and to be re-
garded as a bore Accordingly, Mr. Griffith has been
driven to oppose other things—a direct mail service,
for instance, and land grant railways—which the work-
ing man rather approved than otherwise. The land-
grant system, for example, has the vehement opposition
of the squatter class, and Mr Griffith really had a
chance of ousting Sir Thomas MTlwraith next session
on that question, by struing up an alliance with the
alarmed pastoral tenants He has, however, just marred
his prospects afresh, by rt cognising the necessity of
propounding an alternative scheme for constructing
the grand trunk railways promised without taxation by
MTlwraith. Mr. Griffith's plau is a differential
taxation—of squatters alone I This is certainly not
statesmanlike. It is not equitable or fair. And, what
is more, it is not judicious.
France for Sale.
The influence which Laon Oambetta wielded in
the affairs of France may now bt clearly appreciated.
No sooner has the grave closed over the great Tribune
than dynastic cliques commence to roar their headf.
Tuere seems small reason for doubting that the cause
publicly alleged by Prince Napoleon for the precipitate
issue of his manifesto claiming to be the persona
representative of the Napoleonic race and system was
the real one. The partisans of the legitimist pre
tender, the Comte de Chambord alias Henri V.
appear to have commenced their machinations ae soon
os Qambatta had drawn his last breach ; and if the
Imperialist pretender desired not to be anticipated, an
immediate declaration on his part became necessary.
The attitude of eaoh monarchical party illustrates the
difference of their systems. The Bourbon cause com.
mauds always a constant corps of intriguers in the
Roman Catholic clergy of France, who, however willing
to strike a bargain with a Bonaparte actually
established in power, have an essential and traditional
preference for the old royal family. The difference is
just this, that the Boaapartos, the greater and the less,
have always used the clergy, whereas the olergy have
always used the restored Bourbons. The Imperial
ideal on the contrary can reckon on comparatively few
organized or hereditary adherents. Its modern repre-
sentativea found their title to govern upon the vulgar
assent, as convoyed in a plebiscite—an expression easily
manufactured once the Qovcrnment departments are
under Bonapartist direction. When a man has eo idea,
he generally falls back upon a sentiment; and when a
nation sees no man to represent and be the embodiment
of a political theory, it is iqually apt to fsll back upon
a dynasty. This seems to te the situation in France
now that Qambetta is dead. The nominal rulers do not
appear to be sure of their own minds, or resolutely
faithful to the Republican ideal. Their vacillation?,
when confronted with a motion to expel the chief
Imperialist and Legitimist conspirators seem to indicate
that they themselves aro desirous of keeping on fair
terms with the plot ors, in view of possible contingencies
The example of Monk has had many imitators since
Charles II. was restore 1 to the throne cf England i and
appearances encourage the idea that among the present
Ministers of the French Republio ore some who would
have no objection to repeat in a fashion the r6le of
Monk,
Garbett, the deserving young person who secured Dr.
Eenwick s esteem by his talent in managing to bo
rdated to “several of our native families," is not to
build an £850,000 bridge for his oolonial relatives, just
yet. The Stuart Cabinet has distinctly sat upon
Garrett, and has otfsred him back his £5000 deposit
raceipt. But Garrett has shown no alacrity in grasp-
ing at the document. On the contrary, he has claimed
to go on with the £850 000 bridge. The point seems to
be that there is absolutely nothing in the £5000 deposit
for Garrett, as it never belonged to him, whereas there
would be alot in th 9 right to sell the right to make the
bridge. Mr. Garrett considers the Government of the
colony p'edged, since Parkks had promised he would
order his majority to give him the contract. But
Stuart and Co. decline to honour Parees* promissory
a >to, on ihe grounds that ho had no authority to draw.
We quite feel for Qarbett. He very nearly made
quarter of a million by one coup, net profit after Ihe
txscal expenses. And he has been for nearly a year the
ustensible owner of that £5000 deposit. And now, at
ane fell blow, he loses all. No one cares now to be civil
to him on the chance of shares. He will get drum-
sticks of these brahmas instead of liver wing. And, as

Sik William Fox, K.C.M.Q, formerly Premier of
New Zealand, has been reading to the Colonial Institute
a paper on the Native Question in that colony. Sir
William prudently made the Treaty cf Waitanga in
1840 his point of departure, and, arguing from that
convenient basis, demonstrated to his own satisfaction,
and proba’ilr, that of most listeners, that successiv e
colonial Government were fully justified in having con-
fiscated native lands from time to time by way of
punishment f or acts cf lawlessness and rebellion, and
that the steps that were taken were necessary fo: t le
security of the lives of the colonists, and the preserva-
tioncf the peace of the country. This is all ri 6 ht, end
seems to furnish a very fair sample of the fashion ii
which ‘'conscientious" persons quiet their scruples
an I itrangla their sense of right and reason. Who
will dcubtthat by 1840, the unlucky natives cf Njw
Zealand, «x operated first by the invasion, and th.n by
the successive encroachments and pretensions t f the
(flnglisb, had drifted into half a dozen technically w IO ng
oositions, and had committed acts of outrage and
‘rebellion,” But now, isn’t this sort of argument a
arcc and a burning shame, and moreover, adapted to
cloud people's reasoning faculties and senso cf abstract
right and wrong? What are the facts ? W* plump
down on a-rountry o icupied by an inferior and savage,
bat high spirited, race, end wo seiz ) a tract of country ;
by a trick, if we can diddle the natives by pretended
suavity, otherwisi by violence. Then after a few years
we proceed to issue a proclamation, declaring all the
territory we can map with reasonable accuracy to be
part of her Majesty's dominions; and the rest time a
native resists a further practical encroachment, we
don’t shoot him for a savaf e boast, but wo execute him as
a “relel,” and if there happen to be a whole tnba or so in
arms, we solemnly anathematize them as rebels to their
Queca and country I Aud fteverand gentlemen solemnly
sless the colori of tho troops whom wo march against
these “rebels,” and well-meaning persons pray to God
Almighty for the success of our arm’, being too much
stupefi >d by the prevalence of the Fox style of
ment, to oompretead that they are deliberately insult,
ing their Maker by such shameless petitions, When
we enter a country populated by aboriginal races, our
system has always been to take the country first, with
as little violence as possible, but to take it; and then,
when we have it, to invent some sophistical style of
argument which will deceive ourselves and our God.

fTlHIS NEWEST and NEAREST JOAL MINE to SYDNEY supplies the CHEAPEST, CLEANEST, and
I THRIFTIEST Household and Steaming Coai la the Colony,
19s. FEB TON NET, delivered within City bounds.
This new Coal, with a good draught, and range and bars kept well free from ash, makes a stronger, more lasting*
and cleaner fire than any other. It neither has the objectionable smoky flare and soot of Newcastle ooal. Inor does
it splinter and fly oil like the Western, but it affords that domestic desideratum of some kinds of English ooal of
beating an iron or cooking a steak as thoroughly and cleanly as a charcoal or breeze Are, while it imparts to the
steak none of that disagreeable odour of the unwholesome fumes given off by a broeae or gas fire.

THEGREAT
ONE OP THE WORLD’S GREATEST
OARSMEN.
IN a recent conversation In Kingston, Canada, with
a representative of one o# the foremost Journals of
the United States, Mr. Edward Triokett, the celebrated
oarsman, who la at present open to row any man in the
world, gave the following os his opinion.
** I have found St, JACOB'S fc>i < a sure and certain
cure, and one unequalled by any medicine. It oared
me of severe pates in hack, brought on by ovar-ox-
ertlon in rowing. It is a pleasant, safe, and sore
remedy, penetrating at once to the seat of the disease,
and eradicating the complaint without farther trouble."
The writer listened attentively to the above. It ws*
pleasant to hear such high words of praise from one
who knew what he was talking about; and now ho says
that St. JACOB’S OIL and good athletic training, or
what all our young men want.

It is stated that the Prince Imperial was sent
ff to fight in Znluland, because he had fallen in love
and was going to marry, the daughter of an
twllsh shopkeeper. When found slain in the field, a
inattire portrait of the girl was found on his bosom,

Mr. A B. Noel, the recently appointed Judge of
■ Northern District Court, Queensland, is only 27
10 rs of age. He is a son of the Victorian Chief Com-
missioner of Insolvency and while in Melbourne was
briefless. Members of tho legal profession over there

appointment made yet that didn’t make somebody

p£re Hyacinth is said by the Paris Figaro to
. retracing his steps towards Borne. Tho death of
Dean Stanley was a groat blow to his cause. Thera
mayb0 BO truth whatever in the statement. Pore,
however, is hard-up, a condition which almost always
precedes repentance. The fact, hoswever, is that if the
ex.monk holds to his published opinions, he cannot
consistently remain a member of any Christian sect.
Oh! and what is this we have ? Lord Charles
Scott- who was to have come out from home to marry
Miss Bran, has not arrived in Melbourne yet. Neither
has any explanation arrived. But his fiancie shall not
lose h«r spirits if we can help it. Just listen to this
Be cheerful Miss, your lover is
P’raps poor but never lalse ;
If he must work his passage out

Mr. Claussen, who was accidentally killed at
Birmedman the other day, was one of the best known
mining men in Australia. He was a director of a score
or so mining companies in New South Wales, and
recently arrived at Barmedman from Melbourne on a
visit of inspection. While descending the No. 3 Ada
shaft, with his foot in a loop of the rope, he somehow
lost his grip, and was precipitated 120 feet. He was an
extraordinarily heavy man, his weight being set down
at 20 stone. Death was instantaneous.
The gifted Waltorns Brown, proprietor of the
Wilcannia Times, is a man of multifarous avocations.
He is in one act a printer and bookbinder, bookseller
and stationer, insurance agent for a few hundred offices,
auctioneer, stoek, station, and general commission
agent, arbitrator and appraiser, forwarding agent, regis-
trar of brands, land agent, deed procurer, Lands and
Government Offices agent, transfer drawer. Deputy

Brown. There isn’t a square inch ef the gigantic intel-
lect of Walterus that isn’t surveyed, pegged out, and

There died the other day in Sydney, Mr. L. E.
Monorieff. pianoforte tuner, aged 50 years. He was a
member of the House of Monorieff, of Carlton Hall,
Elinburgh, and son of the late Captain Monorieff. The
name of this old Scotch family has been rendered
notorious, both in N.S. Wales and in the old country,
within the memory of many of our readers. The much-
noted Mrs. Munro, tho wife cf Captain Munro, who led
a certain section of Sydney society with such dashing
care-for-nothingness a few yeirs ago, was a Monorieff.
So, by the way, was the respondent! in the cause Mor-
dannt v. Mcrdaunt, in which H.B.H. the Prince of
Wales so successfully maintained the privileges of
Eoyal blood. And so was but enough ; for further
particulars apply to the King-street Scotih Peerage,
Mr. Piddington is a heaven-horn financier. With
his old-sighted goggles ha sees clearly that blue ruin
mat ensue if auction sales are stopped; bat he hasn’t
yot purchased the telescope that focusses to his vision
the point of time when auction sales will stop of them-
selves, because thoro’ll be no moro land to sell. Suppos-
ing, he cries, you have to impose now taxation to make
np this deficiency ? What then? Says Pid : —Then
1 imagine the people of this country will ask, ‘ Why do
you impose new taxation i-imply to accommodate some
doctrinaire with regard to the public lands ? Why should
you impose a tax to the tune of £350 000 simply to
accommodate a school of political enthusiasts This
side of oratory is catching. It is “imposing” in a
double sense. Wo wonder whether Piddington ever
took a turn at practical book-keeping ? This question
is pimply one of proper book-keeping. If Pid. sells his
landed property bit by bit, wouldn’t he bo a spendthrift
diot to credit the receipts to his ordinary general
revenue ? It he suddenly stopped selling off parcels of
and, would he consider that his income proper had
suddenly diminished P It is not worth arguing.
It has transpired that the late Vincent Wallace,
who by the way was long a resident of Sydney, was
dreadfully giddy. In London his eldest son lately
announced that Vincent’s widow and children were in a
condition of beggary. While stops were being takfn to
relieve tho want* of Mrs. Wallace and her children, a
surprising letter arrived from New Mexico, which
stated that there was absolutely no foundation for the
statement that Mrs. Wallace was destitute. The writer
of this called himself tho “ eldest son” of the late Mr.
Vincent Wallace, whoso widow, hie mother, he said was
living with him in Now Mexico in comfort, if not in
affluence. This story was again contradicted by the
London “ eldest eon,” and all the original statements
repeated. After much speculation, and a good deal of
unnecessary bitterness, it has at length been discovered
that Mr. Vincent Wallace had two wives and two
“ eldest sons," besides other children. The first of
these, is in London, and very poor; the second, once
known as Hdlems Stoepel, is living with her sou in New
Mexico.
Amongst recent visitors to Sydney were Messrs.
.1. C. Bray and J. L. Parsons, the Chief Secretary and
Minister of Education respectively of South Australia
Mr, Bray is about as small as G B. Dlbbs is tall, only a
lot of Dibbs’ width has by a freak of nature got into
Bray. Not that the latter is stout, but because our
own G. R. D. is shadowy in his lateral sections. Bray
has a big forehead, and a perkiah, boyish face, that
always looks sharp, but never dignified. Parsons wears
along, well-dressed beard, a bright, large, intelligent
pair of eyes, and a sedate demeanour. From a recent
Adelaide Punch cartoon, in which he was sitting with
the other members of the 0. A. Ministry over a lot of
barrels of gunpowder, with Governor Jervois as Guy
Fawkes underneath in the cellar, we gained the
impression that Parsons was a pirate out of luek. But
he isn’t. He’s a smooth-tongued, affable, polished
gentleman, who speaks in sermonistioaliy-rounded
PMiods—indeed, he was a Baptist parson once—and is,
privately, a good fellow, troubled with an inscrutable
valvular complaint, of which his enemies at his last
election tried in vain to takea sinister advantage From
the clerical game he deflected to woolwashing, or
felimongery, or something or other —what was it ?—in
the Hlndmarsh (S.A.) style—certainly not briokmaking
though. Anyway, once more he is in the Ministry. The
business of these gentlemen ia tho adjustment of pro-
portionate border duties.
Judge Cope, County Court Judge in Melbourne,
is one of the most popular men on the Bench. He is
the gayest and hardest worked judge in the colony.
Though a man of mental weight and ability there i s
nothing of the homme sirieux about him. His favourite
drink is “ Danville,” and all hia legal metaphors and
hypotheses are based on this brand and no other. He is
desirous of putting a supposititious case to n Jury. Does
he ransack sea and sky for similes H Not he. Ho,
simply turns to whisky. “ Suppose I want to buy 59 >
cases of whisky,” &c. “ Suppose a man sella me two
oases of whisky and says it’s ’ Danville,’ and it isn’t,"
&c Illustrations of this sort make up in homeliness
and familiarity for what they lack in brilliance or
sublimity. The Judge is also a first-class violinist and
the best of company at any time. He is President of
the “ Voriok” and Vice-President of the “Garden Club."
His weakness —for he is mortal and therefore erring—is
pretty women. For this and for his late decision that
three-oard monte is a game of skill, the Southern
Cross says that when he dies he will go to hell. We
shall be glad to meet him.
Thady O’Kane, the firebrand of the North, is a
tall, thin man, with grizzled hair, and a smile—a
sardonic smile, suggestive of slain enemies. His paper,
the Northern Miner, is always full of colour, if
nothing else. Wnatever Thady thinks, Thady says.
Consequently, Thady has enemies who don’t leave many
stones unturned to turn him out. But the miners stand
by him, and whatever libel suit he may get into
they make it right. So he lashes the townsfolk right
and left, and, in the good oil Hibernian style, hits a head
wherever he sees it without any regard for the conse-
quences. Those who are hit hard shake their fists at
him when they meet him in the street, and say, “ Sir,
your ay e protects you." Thady_ cares little what it is
that protects him as long as he is protected. Bat his
paper pays. Charters Towers is a rich goldfield, and
the Northern Miser has a large circulation. Trades-
men, therefore, no matter how little they like the pro-
prietor, must advertise in his journal. So Thady
dresses well, wears a stovepipe hat, and drives about in
a buggy, or rides around the town with his daughter, a
handsome girl, on horseback. He has a nice house, a
nice office, and nice family. Altogether, Thady is a
very different being to your ordinary snake-ridden and
horror-haunted country journalist. We also might
might wear a tall hat and drive about in a bnggy if
there were any encouragement given to literature in
this colony. Bnt there is’nt, and wa are tired of
journalism. If somebody’s handsome daughter—with
a handsome dowry—would come and rescue us we would
never writ o another line. This is a chance you don’t
meet every day, girls.
Success has made “Kosmos,” of the London
World hypercritical. In the administering of an
unmerciful castigation to Tennyson, called forth by his
“ Promise to May," he says : —“ Marius should nave
died when ho was descending from his Teutonic chariot;
Thackeray should have laid his pen finally down before
he wrote * Philip;’ and Alfred Tennyron, if the sequel
of hia industry were to be such trash as * The Promise
of May,' should have sank into silence since ke sang
the last Idyll of the King.
* In life’s last scene what prodigies surprisa ?
Fears of the brave, and fellies of the wise ;
From Marlborough’s eyes the streams of dotage flow,
And Swift expires a driveller and a show.’"
This is capital “copy,” of course, for style ; but what
Mr. Escott says about “ Philip on his way through the
World" is great rot; the book being a most delightful
study of Paris, and thoroughly healthy in tone :—which
is a good deal more than can t-e said, with truth, of
either ” Vanity Fair’’ or “ The Nowoomes’’—which are,
looking at them from a Congregationalist point of
view, of the world worldly. In the “ Promise of May"
the failure was perhaps less the fault of the author than
ef the people who produced it, since, it is pretty plain,
no piece which is all pitch and no “ business’’ should be
produced at all. It seems that in “ The Promise” the
heroi Edgar, has speeches about Freethought as long as
the Mont Ccnis tunnel, and tho dialogue is, generally
speaking, as bald as the proverbial badger. Mr. Irving
accepted " tho Cup," he cut it down so, that when
Tennyson went to rehearsal he cried to have it back
again. And so the “ Cup” was a success. Bad though
Mr. Tennyson’s last effort is, it seems a pity to slate
him when he has done so much good work. Will
“ Kosmos” do any better, we wonder—at 73 I
Mrs. Langtry ia now more talked about than
any woman in tho world. Only one thing was required
to raise her to the acme of celebrity. It has come—a
rumour, a suggestion, a half-whispeted accusation of
something improper, and now her fame ia blazing at a
great white heat. Whether well-based or ill-based,
there is a scandal. Her lady companion, Mrs. Labon-
chere, whose matronly protection was to ensure tho
observance of les convenances, and to stifle in its earliest
stage the least whisper of suspected improprieties, has
deserted tho Lily. For Mrs. Labouchere herself is the
first to find out that the groat beauty has been naughty.
During her stay in New York, the Lily was, of course,
the object of incessant and extraordinary attention
from gentlemen, bnt her chaperone said that at last, in
the case of yonng Fred. Gabhardt, these attentions
were going too far, Mrs. Langtry didn’t see it in that
light; so the ladies parted. Mrs. Labouchere moralises
over the frailty of her quondam charge, and laments
her frivolity, her caprice, and her tottering reputation.
Mrs. Langtry, so far, has only replied by a cold and
haughty silence. Mr. Fred. Gabhardt ia a handsome
yonng man of 23, who lives at a hotel, keeps a four-in-
hand, has eighty thousand a year, and can’t spell
correctly. Of him, "Flaneur,’* of New York, says:—
“Hois an ass, and an imitation of everything that is
English. I have heard Mr. Gebhardt brag of his
alleged conquest, and know of his extravagant enter-
tainments in the Lily’s honour. The youth has several
millions, and lives like a prince. He is a member of
several clubs, and runs after women constantly. He
affects the most grotesque of Erglish drawls, and im-
ports everything he wears and uses direct from London.
Ha is thin and unhealthy looking, and drives miserably.
Nevertheless, he has a social position of some import-
ance. and has some imitators." He sent the Lily nearly
$1000 worth of flowers in New York, and finally
wanted to send his carriage and horses for her to
Boston. Mrs. Langtry had favoured him with her
company on public drives, bnt declined to acknowledge
that that was wrong. She failed to see that bis
admiring her, or even driving her, was a social crime.
There are two sides to the story, and everyone wants to
hear them both. Consequently, while New York is
agog with excitement about her alleged lapse from the
paths of wisdom and virtue, it is making frantic efforts
to find out all there ia to know. The most insatiate
eagerness is displayed by people who should know
better, to ascertain, if possible, the exact extent of her
wrong-doing, and it would seem as though it were the
sole and moat important aim of every man, woman, and
child in New York to find out just how immoral she is.
Scores of reporters are scouring the city, interviewing
theatrical people who know nothing about Mrs. Lang,
try, tracing all sorts of wild rumours, and eagerly tak-
ing down the words of the gossiping old hens of the
club. When Mrs. Labouchere first told her specious
story, Mrs. Langtry was strongly condemned by those
who never stopped to think that it was only one side of
a woman’s quarrel; a quarrel, moreover, in which one
woman would be more than probably goaded en by the
pricks of jealousy- "Flaneur" says: “Mrs. Labou-
chore is nob well known here, or her story would be
received with more suspicion. She is n®t the legal wife
of Labouchere, and. had lb not been for her company,
many people would have invited Mrs. Langtry to their
houses. Bat, notwithstanding that Mrs Labouchere
became daily more unpopular. Mrs. Langtry clung to
her with undaunted pluck. It must be remembered
that the Lily has been brad a lady, while Mrs Labou-
ohere’s breeding was got when she was a rather sensa-
tional London actress known as Henrietta Hsdson."
However, it ia certain that the two have parted, to the
detriment of both. Mrs. Langtry may possibly have
been indiscreet, but she astonished some of the New
York aristocrats by refusing their invitation to dinner
because an objectionable English nobleman had been
asked ; and tho refused to accept an £800 diamond ring
bought for and offered to her by a son of the millionaire.

Brigadier-General George Jackson Carey, C.B.,
has just died in England, aged 60 years. For a few
months after Sir Charles Darling’s recall, Carey was
the Acting-Governor of Victoria, then in a highly.dig-
turbed state politically .Robert Moore, one of the
oldest members of the Victorian detective force, died
on Sunday last from epilepsy and effusion of blood on
the brain, aged 49 years Farewell banquet was given
to Mr. Bobert Precious, of Precious, Djust, and Co.,
fancy warehousemen, the other day. The firm’s
Precious is going on a European trip, and the employes
gave him an illuminated address. They didn’t give
nim any Precious dust, however. He took that with
him Darley, Q C., returned to Sydney per French
steamer Caledonien. We trust that while on his
travels he indulged only in Wholesome Fun....Gustavo
Dor5, the celebrated artist, is dead Gladstone's
health rapidly improving at Cannes, France ; he has
been visited by tho Prince of Wales..,...Herr von
Flotow, tho well-known musical composer, has died,
aged 70 years At Adelaide, Rev. Q. W. Patchell was
suddenly, at the Wesleyan Conference, seised with an
apoplectic fit; he died in n few hours Mr. B, V.
Boulger, M A., of Dublin University, and tho present
Greek Professor of Cork University, has been appointed
to the Chairs of English Literature and Language, and
Mental and Moral Philosophy, in the Adelaide Uni-
versity Chief Justice Sammy Way, of 8.A., has
succeeded Bishop Short as Chancellor of the Adelaide
University.
A Chicago paper says “ Mrs. Langtry travels
on her shape, and people who’ve seen her say she’s as
pretty as a red waggon. For many years she stood np
in a stall at flower shows and fairs, and sold button-
hole bouquets at a nickel each. For this kind of work
she received about the same wages as the Queen of
England. But speaking of professional beauties, we
don't think they ought to be encouraged. No man who
has been down town all day doing trade, would like to
go home, tired and hungry, and find that the wife of
his bosom had set up as a professional beauty. Beauty
is something a man wants all to himself ; and after he
has gone to the expense of getting married and setting
up housekeeping, he doesn’t feel exactly like sub-
letting his n*wly-acq aired possession Beauty may do
very wsll to fill a house with joy and peace, and illumine
every careworn crevice in a husband's heart, but when
you come to spread the beauty all over England and
part of the United States, you find it spreads mighty
thin. Beauty is for one home, not for a nation. In
fact, we consider that beauty is an article that shonld
be kept strictly and entirely for family use, and not let
out to other fellows on any terms whatever. That’s
why wo don't risk much on professional beauties.’*
Some facts about the Bank of England. It is
governed by a governor, a deputy’governor, and 24 direc-
tors. The governor’s and deputy's offices are changed in
rotation every two years. The salary of each is £1600
a year ; that of a director is £500. Eight directors go
out and eight come in annually, elected by the Court
of Proprietors as recommended by the Court of Direc-
tors. A searching enquiry is made into the character
of every new candidate proposed. The qualifications
for a director are the pot session of bank stock to the
amount of £2000, for the deputy-governor £3000, and
for the governor £4000. The stock of paid notes for
five years is about 68,000,000 in number, and they fill
13,000 boxes, which, if plaoed side by side, would reach
2i miles; if the notes were plaoed in a pile they would
reach to a height of five miles; or, if joined end to end,
would form a ribbon 11,000 miles long; their original
value was over £2,200,000,000, and their weight over
80 tons. A note once cashed by the bank is never re-
issued—a beneficial practice which colonial banks
would do well to follow. We understand that the
Bank of New South Wales intends calling in all Us
dirty notes.
Nowhere perhaps has the dentist’s art obtained such
high excellence as in Sydney. Certainly we are in no
sense behind any other city. Visitors to Sydney might,
to test this, visit the establishment of Messrs. Adolphe
Gabriel and Company, 18, Wynward Square, two doors
from Pfahlert's Hotel. Here the manufacture of every
essential in the profession is carried on. At the rear of
the surgery is a compact little factory where all the
requisites for supplying every dental defect in the
human mouth are made. Messrs, Gabriel and Co.
(whose only address is as above) are always pleased to
show their specimens of artificial teeth to those
interested. There being two firms of the same name in
the Square, patients will oblige by paying particular
attention to the Christian name, Adolphe, and the num-
ber, 18, 2 doors from Pfahlert’s Hotel.—Advt.
In Wyoming Territory, U.S., during the period
of building the Union Pacific Bail way, a passenger who
refused to eat bail sausages was shot dead. His mur-
derer was acquitted—” justifiable homicide." This
law has been reversed now. An Idaho judge has ruled
that the refusal of a boarder to eat codfish-hallo does
not justify the restaurant-keeper in shooting him. In
Nevada, a man named Sullivan potted one Miller, for
wearing his hat in a ballroom. The judge has not yet
decided whether this is “ justifiable homicide."
Billy Pritchard, Mayor of Leichhardt, is a
plucky, straivhtforward customer, if at times a little
bit erratic. His mayoralty has meant fearless work—
a policy that has not suited some people and they oen-
snred him. Billy took the difficulty by the horns,
called a public meeting to consider his oondnot, and
got an overwhelming vote of'confidence. There’s only
one Richmond In the field at Leiobhardt now; the other
fellow crawled under the fence. '
Mr. Walter Birohall, of Park Bead, Moore
Park, took his family out for an airing on Monday week,
and left a loaded revolver to mind the house in ease a
burglar came along. A burglar did come, scooped a
pool of £25 and jewellery, and walked oflt with the
revolver into the bargain.
At Edmonston, England, a married man. named
William Bishop, has been fined £5 for assaulting Mrs.
Ferguson, a married woman, by publicly kissing her in
the street. The Bench called the proceeding disgrace-
ful, but Bishop said he’d like to take another at the
same price.
The High Church.
Money, oh 1 Money, of thy praises I sing.
Thou art my Saviour, my God, and my King;
’Tis for thee that I preach, and for thee that I pray,
And make a collection twice each Sabbath day.
I’ve candles and all sorts of dresses to buy,
I wish you to know that my church is called High,
I don’t mean in structure of steeples or wall.
Bat so high that the Lord cannot reach it at all.
I’ve poor in my parish who need some relief,
I preach to their poverty, pray at their grief;
But I send my box round to them morning and night
And hope they’ll remember the poor widow’s mite.
I gather my knowledge from wisdom’s great tree,
And my trinity’s name is the “ Great L. 8. D.,"
Pounds, shillings, and pennies are all that I crave
From my first step on earth to the brink of the grave.
Oh I when I am dead, and my body’s at rest,
Place a box on my grave—’tis my latest request;
That my friends may all gee that come there in
affection
I can’t rest in comfort without a collection.
Money’s my creed, and I’ll not pray without It;
My heaven is closed against all those who doubt it;
This is the essence of High Church religion—
Come often to ohnroh, and bo plucked like a pigeon.
My pay may be hundreds or thousands a year,
Double it, treble it, still I am here
With my purse and my bags for collecting your
money,
I oan’t, like St, John, live on locusts and honey.
I'll have carriage and horses, with servants and all.
I’m not going to foot it like Peter and Paul;
But I grab all your cash with a wink and a nod,
Pocket three-thirds my telf, and give—praises to God.

that Mr. D Orsev Ogden wrote this noble

Ppeakincr of Ireland, there se’ms to be con-
■ ite able diversity of opinion among the performers as
fwhar is the correct Irish accent. D'Oisay makes it
and Ihe Dutch talked through a ciw-horn, while
Erauk Towers makes it so thin and nasal that it leaves
i e audience under the impression that they are listen-
! 11 Jo a ventriloquist with the croup talking pigeon-
t'nelish Bosa’s brogue is, however, beautiful and

D’Orsay Ogden is a decent actor. It
ieve's us exceedingly that we can’t speak more en-
thusiastically about him t.hau this. He has not the
Irrasp which is the distinctive quality of a great actor.
At his best,' one is conscious of a weakness about him.
the eyes of his soul have white lashes. The mental
* n,pli xi°n of a great actor is dark and ruddy—full of
strong colouring matte-, and decided. We can t say
that D O'say Ogden’s is like this, unless we lie, and
that would oe taking the bread out of the mouths of
the Evening News men.
* * *
jj 0 D'Orsay Ogden is not much of an actor, but
he has the sati faction of knowing th«t he is as good a
oueas Frank Towers, and Frank Towers has not made
a fortune out of h's gifts—at least not yet. In this
„lav, however, he (Frank) played the part of an Irish-
man very well—leaving out, of course, the fact that it
was a stage Irishman, which is a libel upon the race,
an 4 that, anyhow, Frank bus no more eonoeption of the
s ,nrd of the Irish brogue than if he bad learnt to speak
it from a deaf parrot.
• * *
Boea looked very nice as Aileen—when does she
not look moe,—and Mr. Joyce made a fine old farmer
(■onnthing, not to mention Frank Catos who, as Lord
Lieutenant of Ireland was nothing less than astounding.
This is at’rlbutarie to the play, however. Wo would
certainly be very glad to see Mr, Oates doing woik
which is more fitted for him His abilities are really
first-class, and it is a pity t> sea them wasted We
have written about the rest ot tbe actors who appear in
the play, and given onr opinion about their ability so
many times that it is not necessary foe u» to say any-
thing more now, especially as they are just tbe same in
this as in everything else. But wp can’t finish witt o it
a word for tbe piece. It is not half a bad drama if it
were properly mounted, and properly playod, and
considerably out down. That's ail.

Tho new attraction at Zulu Thompson’s Krall,
is a rtpreieolation of tho English Fleet bombarding
Alexandria. It is real'y well done. We don’t know
whether the pie lure ot Alexandria is rigidly correct,
because, though we worn them once, vie were on a
den key and he wanted to pass through in a hurry, but
it looks as good as if it were, anyhow. And tho ships
are worked well > et, ihaugb we do not pretend to be
adepts in naval warfare—or, it deed, in anything ex’ept
hash-hiding—we would respi otfnil v suggest to Zulu
that it is not usual lor shit s 1 o lie broadside to hroad-
side when they are blazing away at tbe enemy. We are
in fact, positively convince! that properly commanded
ships do not, if firing, fire through each other, in order
to hit some’hirg on the other side. But genius i» a
law unto itself, and Zulu is » genius Hermann,
after ho has finished carrying about the salt cellar*
and pepper-castors that are given away every night,
gives an entertainment which he calls a “Frolic in
Finland ” or something of the sort, which is a scream
from beginning to end. H<rnmnn is certainly a clever
ventriloquist. The hall is filled every night.

“ Boccaccio” is still drawing large audiences to
the Opera Home. The new feature about this really
nice opera is Johnny—we beg his pardon, Giovanni —
O'Neill’s rendtring of the leading tenor part which he
modestly consented to assume when Acmes Beaumont
hurt his ankle the other day. Johnny appears to bo on
hand in case even the primma donna herself meets with
an accident, when he g iee in to rehearsal 1 his

The death of the late Archbishop of Canterbury
was due to an illness which originated in a remarkably
characteristic manner. At the commencement of his
illness the spirit of devotion to his duty, which was a
marked feature of his career, impelled him to go to
Osborne to confirm tbo sons of the Prince of Wales in
August last, against the strongly-i xpress-d opinion of
his medical adviser. “ It is the last thing I shall do tor
the Queen,” he said, “ and I mean to do it.” He caught
cold, and the attack ot inflammation of the lungs which
came on was the beginning of his last illness. His
flunkeyism killed him. If it had only been the eons ot
a pauper he had gone, against the advice of his medical
attendants, to confirm, what a glorious Christian death
his would have been 1

It is a good thing marriages are performable
outside church ceremonials. A woman stood up in

father of my children, and he has always promised to
marry me. But now, when I am growing old, (here her
voice ti cm bled, and she nearly fanted) now,” the said,
“ became 1 am getting old, he has oast me otf. Minister,

towards Christ’s apostolical-successioned represen-
tative. But tbe Eev. Smug, held down by Church
authority, sternly commanded her to keep silence, as
she was liable to punishment for disturbing the services
And so tho old Isoariotism that in tho Church has

People want to know what the conductors of
tho Holt Howl believe ab< ut Hell, 'iney have just
been furiously pitching into Archbishop Vaughan for
representing that his church does not require a belief
that the never-ending punishment in Hell is physical
suffering by fire ” The Howl remarks that this is the
way the Chuich and its teachers play with their peo-
pie.” and enquires, fairly enough, how it is that all over
the world she teaches “ horrible details of torture by
material fire.” Tho Howl quotes a certain Father
Furness, whose pamphlets represent that the blood of
some deceased children “ is heard boiling in Hell like a
kettle on the fire.” This is nob a cheerful picture, eer-
tolnly, but surely the Howl is not quite candid m using
he horrors of such theories as a weapon against the
Papists Unless (ha reverend editors of the Protes-
tant Standard have succumbed to the influence of
‘modem thought,” and have adopted Nationalistic
idea', they are bound to teach these identical horrors.
The dogma of a bell which is physical suffering by fire
vas. only 31 years ago, tnught without reservation or
“toning down” to ewr? Protestant child. To doubt
the reality of “burnirg fire” would, in those days,
have been reckoned as horrible as to believe in the
dsims of rim Popo. If tbe editors of the Howl are not
Infidels and Freethinkerr, they must believe m a Hell
>f Burning Fire, and it is diriionesr in them to nse the
repugnance which close investigation of that devilish
Vt of theologv inspire’, as a weanon against Dr.
Vaughan, who is not pro’e sionally a bit more bound to
tick by Hell than are the Methodist parsons who run
the Ho XL. If Dr. Barry is been converted, like the
late Bjv. Mr Greenwood, to freetfcought, be had best
iwn up, and get rid of his sectarian hates. It is pretty
veil known that the Freethinkers won’t admit to their
fellowship men who have merely abandoned their old
ireeds without divesting themselves of the old animos-
ities inspired by those creeds.
For a goad piece of sickening and adulation
worship of the golden calf, commend us to the Express
uf last Saturday. An obituary no 1 ice of young James
Mullins (sou of tho late principal partner in Moore’s
Labour Bazaar, Sydney), who died recently in France,
is there penned in all tbej unbridled gush of the
reverend journalist Here now “ S»d, at all tiroes,
is it for no when the kindly Hand et the Father of Life
smites those we love and takes them to Himself and
bereaves us of their presence. But deeper beyond
burr an utterance is the sorrow, end more poignant the
grief of sonl, when the stroke of love falls on those who
are far away from tome and kindred—strangers in a

our minds when wo read the melancholy tilings in a

We have received from Bishop Quinn of
Bathurst, a note conveying a printed copy of that
prelate’e addrtss to his clergy on the Education Ques-
tion, and a suggestion that we should publish that ad-
dress (wbioh would occupy three of our columns) in
The iuLLETiN. We presume ibatasimiiar rtquest was
addressed to tbe S. M. Herald, arm c implied wuh, as the
address was published in that journal. In making this
request to us, Bishop Quinn has blundered. In the first
place, wo don’t give tnree column space to any man’s
dissertations, la the second place, Dr. Quinn has
obviously lost sight cf tho fact, that it was only th«
other day that Lis own newspaper convoyed an iutima.
tion teat good Catholics were not to read i he Bulletin.
The Bishop has evidently fallen into a trap, notef our
selling. In dealing with the Education Act we have
more than once given full prominence to tho injustice
which it inflicted—and was designed to inflict—upon
Roman Oathclies. Tho Bishop nas not been able to
riie to our level in this matter, any note than tho Holy
Howl people, ora writer in a little suburban paper, who
a lew daj s alter one of onr articles on the Education
Act, claimed to have discovered that we had “ thrown
rif tho mask,” and showed our true colours as a Roman
Catholic organ When will these bigots on both sides
comprehend that there may be such a sentiment as an
abstract love of justice. Tho 8yinky Morning
Herald used for yean, while old Fairfax was aiive, io
have the motto, “Bcund to no party; ot no sect am
I,” primed dally over the leader. We oon’t know why
the motto was dropped. But that the Herald was ever
too dull to perceive anything ridiculous in itsoif, it
might have been imagined mat tbe absurd contrast
between that motto and the intensely methodislio—
congregational tone of every opinion expressed in tbe
columns ot tbe paper bad weighed upon its conductors
and induced them from very shame to sink tbe motto.
Anyhow, that motto belongs to us now, and neither
Dr. Quinn nor tbe hottest Orange Fiotestaut will be
wise if he forget It. Oar arguments about the applies-
tion of the Education Act took the direction we gavo
them, not because wh want to play the priests’game,
but because it Dappers to be true that Roman Catholics
have a grievance. We bate injustice, and that's all
about it. We don’t believe in a dominant sect, and
whatever'sect happens to bo trampling «pon another
may always reckon upon our energetic antagonism. The
Orange sect has ban tbe whip nand for a good many
years now, and has lashed its alveisxries with unblush-
ing severity. Perhaps the Catholic sect will have a turn
some day ; since there is no present hope of sectarian
heat cooling down In such ca-o, tho priests and their
creatures are certain to abuse thtir opportunities quite
as grossly ua the Methodist-Orange parsons and their
Jay fellow-bigots have done When tnat happens they
will have The Bulleiin to reckon with, and wa haven’t
tho slightest doubt mure will be plenty of fools then on
the one hand to claim, and on the other to denounce.

Treeve, of Baynes, Treeve, and Co., auctioneers
and forgeis, of Sydney, has been released from Bernina
Gaol. Ilia overtime a:;d special work dating his lengthy
imprisonment makes him the possessor now of £200.
We can't be deludeu, however, into the belief that this
is all the money he has got. Tiecva is s-dd.on good
antbonty, to be a near relative of lord Blayney, and
goes homo to claim the estate in a few weeks. All our
thieves, however, are “well-connected.* By the way,
here are Treuve’s clever forgeries stated in a nutshell.
He ingeniously stuck two promissory notes together,
after cutting away about a-sixth part of the upper one
in the right hand lower corner. By this means, when
tho wealthy directors of the toeiety (one of whom was
Sir George Wigram Alien) signed what was to them a
legitimate bill, say for £*50 or £50u, Treeve had their
signatures on a bill whion he filled up tor £6000 cr
£8000, as uis moral instincts prompted him. The bills
weie easily separated by damping mem. The strangest
feature cf the affair was that the forgeries remained
undiscovered lor many mom he. What xrtove did with
tho money never could be ascertained. When the City
Bank sued the directors for ihe amount, it was extra-
ordinary to find each director acknowledging his signa-
ture, yet swearing it was a forgery. The discovery of
Treeve’s modus operandi gave the Directors a verdict in
every case. Treeve, it will bo remembered, was bowled
out quite accidentally He was one nigut tolling out of
Sydney harbour on beard a small schuoner, purchased
by nlmsell, when she was out down by an Incoming
steamer. Treeve was returned to town, half drowned,
and “ overy care was taken of him." It was said the
schooner had all his plunder on board, but the civets
never found it. The mystery acout Baynes, Treeve’s
partner, io still a problem with many people—especially
those who were victimised for some thousands. Baynta
was repotted dead just at the time Treeve was attempt-
ing his escape. There was some sort of an examination,
of the body, hut apparently an unsatisfactory one.
Will Treeve diop down to this office, and give ua

Thus the bard ;—
It is a moat extraordinary thing that tho men
Who victual tho Salvation Army and run the Blue Ribbon
party, are very tamo as those who are reorganising the
Local Option League. All these movements originate at
the one place—the Temperance Hall, Pitt-street, the
Fountain of Bung and Palace of Humbug in this
bountry. They are the men of the Now Jerusalem—
men bossed by John Davies and David M’Beath. Hero
is the whole history of the party. The bosses who are
supposed to get down to the place before daylight, as
they are now never seen in the street, sit in the recesses
of a room artistically darkened. A man who coa 03 in
out of the light of day, stands at the door for five
minutes unable to observe any object. All this time
the jackals move not a mnsolo. By and bye, their out-
lines become apparent—then they announce themselves.
The feeling of the stranger nt the discovery is that of a
man who being down a dark and dank cellar, suddenly
puts his hand on a snake. This is tho policy of the
New Jerusalem party.

There is likely to be an exodus of poets from
this city pretty soon. The Campbelltown Herald
has just made the astounding announcement that its
columns are always at the disposal of people who "write
verso nicely.’’ We see in thought a long file of weary-
footed weavers of golden words, led by a little man with
spectacles, entering into this Poets* Paradise in the
■dreamy dusk when tho lamps hum dimly and the
shadows gather round men’s hearts. They disappear
through an open doorway, and come out again a minute
after with drooping pinions and crushed and dispirited
locks. They couldn’t get credit for a rum round even
though the little goggled man offered to recite the first
book of his new epic. This is all fancy, you will please
remember. Poets of the stamp we speak of are not
likely to imperil their chances of counter lunches by
following the Muse when she is mad enough to migrate
to Campbelltown. The smell of hash is the centripetal
attraction which always counteracts their desire to soar
away into songful space. We were led into uttering these
apophthegms by a paragraph in the paper mentioned
which desired to “ call attention to an excellent piece
of poetry, written by a gentleman who lives in the main
street of Campbelltown, which appears in another
column." We like tho modest manner in which this
country critic passes his opinion upon the art of arts.
Here is a verse from the " poetry," which by the way
is labelled “ Australia —
“ Advance is thy motto; and may to this end
Thy people in council and action all blend ;
A'oof may’st thou stand from contention and war,
And no foreign foe e’er set foot on thy shore.’’
This is what we call blameless inanity j the crooning of
a harmless lunatic. There is, however, a saccharine
mellowness about the rhythm of tho thing which con-
vincos as that the author might do better if he were to
take up themes that fit his peculiar genius—for instance
he might write a "Soap and sugar Sapphic," a "Trick-
ling Treacle Threnody,” or an " Epic on Egg flip.’’ At
the same time, we must admit that wo think even what
he has done is not much below the literary standard
of the rest of the matterin tho piper in which it is
published. Still we would like to kill him if we could
spare time.

This, a hard country for journalists. It is es-
peolally hard for bush journalists. In their own districts
they are ignored by the parson, snubbed by tho squat-
ter, and patronised by the poundkooper. The most
they can do when maddened by solitude is to go across
tho way and get on terms of drunken amity with the
publican. When they come to Sydney for a holiday—
that is to say, to beg the paper importers to send them
up another bale, or to beseech the suppliers of their
printing plant not to foreclose their mortgage—they
are lost. Nobody, except the people mentioned, has
hoard of their poor little paper. Nobody cares a cuss
whether it will crush the rival rag, or the rival rag
crush it. This is preliminary. We have now before us
a journal of this kind. From time to time we have
noticed it exhibit a certain sick spitefalnecs against
ourselves. We are glad of this. We should not bo
happy unless small things, and mean things, and bad
things hated us. We have no alliance with literary
larvffi, This is what tho poor thing says : " When the
gifted editors of certain vary smart metropolitan jour-
nals descry anything worthy of note in the columns of
original matter in a country exchange, they don’t clip
and acknowledge—they are too sagacious for that; if the
article contains an idea worth anything, and will keep
for a time, they put it aside to bo finally
published in an entirely different shape, ns a creation of
their own ” If the article contains an idea worth any.
thing! Wo wish to heaven it ever did. Wo hive in
our time opened some thousands of country pc pars
without, we say it with tears of sorrow, finding an
article with even the embryo of an idea in it, unless it
was reprinted from ourselves. Those especially that
were written by this satirical sorite were not calculated
to add a new joy ti earth, but finely fitted to add a
fresh pang to hell. We can’t help being clever, door
boys, any more than you can help being dunces; neither
can wo help making fun of you, because fools have been
fair butts for ridicule since the beginning of time. But
you would never have writhed in helpless rage, and we
would never have had a chance to laugh at jon, if you
had adopted such careers as your education and abili-
ties marked you ont for, that is to say, if you had been

We receive every week communications from
a number of correspondents which circumstances oblige
us to hold over. Meanwhile, tho authors of the letters
writhe. When people ask us something easy, we are
generally there. How to personate a dead man, far
instance, or to make bullock’s liver A la Madame
Trdbise, are mysteries wa can unravel. In gardening and
the less distinguished dishes wo were wont to get a bit
fogged, and when “A Constant Beider’’ enquired for

On one occasion, though, an esteemed correspondent
came round foamir g after wo had relegated him to the
Pitt-streot Circulation. It seems ho asked—" Which
is the newofct mode of ploughing pelargoniums when
their condition ha? arrived at one of ssixophonobia.’’
Too answer was as follows:—"!. Tho total cost
of the American War was §1,496.000.000. 2. We
should advise you to consult a good solicitor. (See
advt. in T. and C.)’’ To obviate any little mistakes of
this kind occurring for the future, we have resolved
upon answering our culinary, botanical, and agricultural
correspondents in a bnnoh at frequent intervals. Here
goes for bunch No. 1 :—
“ You’d better sow your coffee-grounds

When a man dies in the Wagga, Hospital, they
carry the coffin intended for him through the sick
ward into tho dead-house. There they screw the
corpse down, and then march back between the beds of
prostrate patients with the lead of mortality on their
t boulders. This is pour encourager lee autresl The
Wagga Hospital is never overcrowded. Whenever an
unusual number of sick come in, they frighten a few old
hands to death. This saves the purchase of new bed*
and keeps down expenses. The doctor may say what

THE MEMBER FOR WHEREAT.
It is said I came back like a sneak
And the freedom of choice now they jeer at.
But it’s just like their consummate check I—
Because I was elected at Whereat.
They question my status and say
’Twas mean for the boss politician,
To oome into the House the back way.
But then they admire the tactician
Who successfully dusted the eyes
Of the Press and the people, who sneer at
The trick; though it saddened the wise.
How I was returned by a Whereat.
Oh 1 yea j it is all right to prate
’Bout purity I principle 1 and stare at
Those peculiar lessons of State
Display’d in election by Whereat.
Diplomacy sly is my trade
Stale platitudes often I utter.
By which a great name I have made—
To me it has been bread-and-butter.
Without Gffloo a patriot I pose,
Tho country in danger cry queerly,
And I do it so well you’d suppose
I expressed the opinion sincerely.
That wretch M'Elhone, and G. Reid
Exposed my pretensions—declared that
They’d prevent my return—indeed
Triumphant they were but for Whereat.
How I smile at their wish to defeat
The Will of the People ; I hear that
They’re going to challenge my seat
Though unanimously chosen—by Whereat.
But play’d out surely isn’t my fate.
Many friends I must have who don’t share that
Opinion that all wasn’t straight
When elected so freely at Whearat,
BY THEIR FRUIT (ORANGES!) SHALL YE
KNOW THEM.
The world rolls round and round tho sun
As merry as can be,
And Time turns round his hour glass too,
Till now it’s Eighty-Three.
What; have the days to bring to us.
What have the nights in store P—
At these things we will try to guess
If we can not do more.
The Ministry will prove it’s one
That can’t be overthrown ;
John Lucas will bring down his weight
To less than thirteen stone.
Fork sausages will soon be made
Of something else than cat;
And Davies will no longer wear
A Coonanbara hat.
Sir Henry Parkes will quite forget
About himself to speak,
The trams will try to out a man
In pieces every week.
Buchanan will grow meek and mild
And liquor-np on tea 5
And M’Elhone will wear kid gloves
In Eighteen Eighty-Three.
A lot of other changes too
Will shortly oome to pass,
The letters M.L.A. no’more
Will signify an asp.
The gallant members of the *' Poorce"
Cold mutton will forswear;
And cabmen will far rather die
Than charge a double fore.
No Civil servant of the Crown
Will o’er bo known to shirk—
The chiefs will learn to watch and pray,
Tho clerks will learn to work.
The Naval Volunteers shall oruiso
And not bo eiot at sea ;
You’ll get a drink on Sunday, too,
In Eighteen Eighty-three.
Fond wives no mere will tear the hair
Of husbands out in lump j
New milk will come from cow, instead
Of iron tank and pump.
A four-pound leaf will weigh four pounds
Exactly to a crumb ;
And hunger will not always haunt
Reporters on iho Rum.
When lawyers will omit to lie
And doctors cease to kill,
When what you eat at restaurants
Shall cease to make) you ill,
When writers of suoh verse as this
No more go on the spree,
You’ll know that tho millenium’s diwnod
In Eighteen Eighty-three.
Nor lowly shepherds, watching in tho glen.
Nor Magi on their journey eastward tarry.
For peace on earth has come, goodwill t’wardsmen,
You know the story, pious Dr. Barry.
Ah I when the child lay sleeping in tho manger.
Ho dreamed not how his teachings would miscarry)
Nor how his chosen ones would roam in danger.
But for such men as you, good Dr. Barry.
Therefore let Protestant hold no communion
With Biddy, Barney, Kathleen, Pat or Larry 5
While preaching peace, perpetuate disunion.
To serve your Master, zealous Dr. Barry.—
Away with truce ’twixt Orange and tho Green,
Let them not intermix nor intermarry
A sword Ho cams to b.ing, not peace I ween
That suits both sides, now dm’t it, Dr. Barry ?
Unite, je Orangemen, and save tho cause.
And aid this man of war tho blow to parry
Shall Copeland, Stuart, Dailey make our laws ?
Not if you know it, shall they, Dr. Barry ?
Summons John Davies’ henchman, M'Evoy,
The firebrand through the little clique to carry j
’Tis just tho sort ef mischief he’ll enjoy.
And so will you, intol’rant Dr. Barry.
Bring out old Eenwick, bo’ll some tales unfold

Than take him back again, confess j ou’ie sold.

Your future else you’ll find somewhat infernal.
Captious, quarrelling, meddling Dr. Barry.

Wo have discovered tho
worst paper in the world-
next to the Shroud, of
eourse. It is published in a
place called Vegetable
Creek, and is, wo should
imagine from the literary
style of its contents, edited
by a horse-radish. Here is
a sample paragraph:—“ Hav-
ing received with an indis*
oreet act a paper of last
week's issue, returned to onr
office after being opened for
his satisfactory purpose,
and the same wrapper re-
placed, I would suggest
if — a gentleman, — I feel
thoroughly assured would
have returned the same
with a few lines his reason ;
and not opened it to read
the contents; just like his
ohnroh-going impotent, pre'
tending praying manner.
We are not aware of him
having a —wife —such men
we put them to be burnt in
a fiery farnaco and treat
them with contempt, and
ignore them, and would ad.
vise the miserable fellow to
oome and pay np for his
quarter and not return a
paper for payment although
a servant employed by his
master." This is unique—
hideously unique. We have
seen villainous writing in
our time, but neve- any-
thing so utterly vile as this.
Further down, the horse-
radish informs us that a
man has opened a book-store
in the town, “ whioh affords
a good opportunity in pro.
oaring good, sound, well,
grounded works to improve
the mind." What weujd he
call a " well-grounded work’*
— an earthwork P This
Vegetable Creek editor was
evidently underground most
of his life, and learnt
English down there from
the blind worms that used
to go np to the surface in
wet weather. And the blind
worms picked it np from
Chinamen. And this is
oonntry journalism.

to the spot. On his arrival there, he toand that the
body was that of a bush-carpenter who had been em-
ployed in erecting some fencing on the plantation. He
rode straight back, and when he got to the house dis-
mounted, and, striding up to the overseer, said, “ Why,
you, you gave me a proper scare. I thought it was
one of < nr ——- Kanakas, but it's only a double-blanked

of Zion. Now just look at this for a shriek of joy, ocst
price nothing. A clergyman not more than a thousand
miles from Forbes, finding some of the infants of his
flock prcfeired his water-melons to his “Words cf

some reward if successful. That night the nigger
caught seven. The parson decided on giving tho tracker
throe guineas for his work, and on condition that the
delinquents paid the cost between them amounting to
nine shillings each, they were allowed to depart in
peace. Verily 1 what the children of this world don’t

BRIEFLESS.
He sat in cobwebs and in dust
The briefless barrister,
His legs were through the chair-rails thrust,
His fingers through his hair.
His elbows through his office-coat
Stuck out like hatohet-elves—
Yet tenderly his eye did gloat
Upon his offioe-shelves.
For there was the Justinian code
And Coke on Lyttleton,
And in between them safely stowed
The code Napoleon.
With Somebody on Feudal Law
And Someone Else oh Fiefs—
This barrister was “ richah faw”
In books of law than briefs.
A knock came to the office-door
“ By heaven, it comes 1" he swore,
" The brief that I have waited for
These seven long years and more.”
Sharply and swift he turned the key
As one on business bent —
And loti it was his landlady
A-lookiug for the rent.
What more ? He pawned his books, he pawned
Hia wig—oh grief of grief I
And still no hope upon him dawned
And still be got no brief.
He thought that sometime ho would win
A Judge’s seat you see,
But now he’s grabbing stumps out in

Whatever people can urge against Alfred on the
scera of excessive liberality, and a too severely classical
style of writing, no one can deny that he is brimming

that her Majesty, by reason, we suppose, of that
divinity which surrounds royalty, dines without plates
—or rather with an average ot half a plate to each guest.
We observe also that each diner is limited to one wine-
glass, and that ono man has got his arms on the table.

The Hon. C. K. Childers has for about twenty-
five years drawn from Victoria a pension of £800 per
annnui, in recognition of having, prior to that date,
been good enough to. hold a Ministerial portfolio and
draw a Ministerial salary for a term. His pension-
drawing has cost the colony £20,000, and he is good for
another decade. Sir C. Gavan Dally is anotner pen-
sioner. £1000 per annum is his whack. It's about as
well that this pension system has been abolished in
Victoria. Otherwise, ex-Ministers would be drawing
about a million every ten years.

One of the Legislative masterpieces of the late
Goternu ent o. isuled in the alteration of the tan e of
Vegeta hie Or ek, au old established aud thriving town
in the N aw E jgland miumg district to “ Emmavuie '*
There was no eirthly reason why the original name of
the tow.ithipbhou d oe discarded, but tmra was an alt-
imporluu', uati nal reason, why the name of “ Emma-
vii e ’ should le tr.-ught into existence. Dr. Ben wick,
’ he thru Minister for Mines was on a visit to the dis-
tr.c , and nis daugl ter s name is “ Emma," so it was
ootB'doiei tbo piOpir thing to commemorate bis visit
by wiling out me uam< of one of the most important
t >wn* in the distuot aud substituting the classic name
of “ E umaville ” Of oou se tho inoonvenienoe that a
good many people will suffer—miners especially—when
Jetcois.iru addressed, to them under the old system, and
ihey hive to wait for a few months while they are being
put thiougb the dead-lelter course, is a matter of insig-
nificance com par d with the importance of immortalis-
ing th . little Doctor or somebody belonging to him.
When Mr. John Davies dived after the last
East Sydney election, he came to the surface next
morning at Kiama, like a now and fleshy ghost. He
attended the Temperance sports, and s -ed lustre on the
com ert in the evening by occunying the obair. To-
morrow (Friday night) the C M Q. is announced to
lecture at Jamberoo—when?, by the way, he got less
support than at any other polling place in the district,
duiing his contest with Dr. Tarrant—on the Biae am
Progiors of the Orange Its itution in New South
Wales.’’ Mr, Davies sagaciously lectures under the
auspices of the local lodge. We have perfect confidence
that the day is not far < ff when some decent man will
lecture on the “Rise, Progress, and Extinction of the
Orange Institution in New South Wales.“ What a
history that alien organization of sectarian hatreds has,
were it truly told. Its rise dates from the epoch of
Parkes’ Kiama Gaost, that spectre respecting which
tno very man who invoked it persuaded the legislature
to wipe out every record aud title of the alleged evi-
dwnci, lest a cool inquiry, when a passing mania should
have subsided, should snow how hollow and fraudu-
le t wan the whole affair. i ho collapse and fall of
Oiaagoism caunot be far distant, when it relies on
such props as tie Davieses, Bcsebys, M’Gufflns,
and is reduced to the condition of a dirty ladder by
waioh the meanest sort of political reptiles crawl into
positions of prominence There has been abundant
evidence that when a man is utterly dishonoured and
disc-edited in every other direction, he will show a cool
ooi Aden ce the t his character, however smirched, is good
enough for Orangemen to hug to their bo-oms. This
alone will suffice to dispose every decent and sell-
respecting man to dissociate himself from an organisa-
tion which dishonours itself by accepting guidance
from the outcasts of pelitical life. Aad when decent
men once begin to c insider their position, they will
speedily perceive that they have been made tools of,
all along, to serve the crooked purposes of desi. ning
knaves who have no more true sense of religion in
t’aem thau a Choctaw Indian. The day is not far dis-
.ant when a maa will go into a corner and whisper
whan he has to confess that be is an Orangeman, so
general is becoming the conviction that this young
country wants no dealings with the imported hates of
Ireland, and that a sectarian bigot, whether he stylo
li neelf a Worshipful Grandmaster ora Bight Eoverend
Bishop, is an object for contempt, not for deference.
Every man’s faith has a title to respect if honestly
held, and not disgraced by being made a mere motive
for attacking and insalting others for their honest
be>iif.

The coming howler of New South Wales, accord-
ing to the Englishmen's opinion, and that of indeper.
dent judges here, i» young Pat Howe cf West Maitland.
Pat is only about 22 years of ego, but ho commenced to
bowl early, i e about 19 years ago. They bought Pat
a doll, and he took it down the yard, cut off its head,
which he used for a ball, propping the legs up for a
wicket. Oa this occasion he knocked trio saw-dnst all
over the yard in two overs. In the matches which the
Englishmen have placed i n Maitland, Pat has been the
only man who could shift them. On the occasion of
the last Intercolonial match in Sydney, 1 he Selection
Committee brought him down to practice before the
final selection was made, but he unfortunately came in
for a heavy dose of sea-sickness on the way down, and
fiuted to show good form. 11 is, however, to bo hoped
that, in the interests of New South Welsh cricket, the
Selection Committee will keep a careful eye on this
promising young colt from the Hunter.
Song of the Spike.
A CRICKETING CAROL.
’Twas ini ho dreetirg room, and lo f
Whoa all were gathered round
Spotf. cut up rou<b on Barlow, 'cause
He oat up rough the ground.
“ Those cursed spikes I” the Demon cried,
“ Have spoilt our chance you sea 1"
“ About my spike then” Barlow said
Just don’t you epike to me,
“ You ploughed it up then," Spofforth yelled.
Comet how would you have liked it ?
Our chance has gone all through that spike,—
It’s just what I ex-spike ted,."
•* You lie!” cried Barlow, then Spoil, "shaped”
Quite quick for the affray ;
All thought, that spike would cause a great
Spiketacular display.
Then Bead appeared, and said— 11 Oh, bosh 1
Of this spike we’re all full j
To tight about a spike is not
A bit rcspiketahle."
" I’ll go for you I” then howls out Spoil,,
But Read said—" No, not quite,
I come out here for crirket, i
Did not come out to fight.”
Thus all this row came to an end
A fracas this of fools
Was this small spike row you will see
Without your spiketacles.

The Tasmanian Licensing Act is oven stricter
than that of N.8 Wales. Ingress and egress is pro-
hibited to and from public-houses on Sundays-, to any
other persona than inmates, lodgers, er traveller- 1 .
Thus, by this extraordinary provision, a publican m »,'■ e
“Tight” Little tsland isdebarred from even receiv e# his
friends on Sunday. His door must I e closed to fanner,
mother, and other relations ; doctor if he bo ill, clorry
if he desire the consolations of religion, ->r a lawjer
should he wish to make his will, unless all these persons
come under the heading of travellers.
“ Gudgeon has been acquitted at Auckland on
a charge of attempted rape on Mrs. Ehrenfri**d.” Thi-
ia the brief wording of a telegram from N.Z. It is
rough on Mrs. E. The all ur oo mrred at Grahauistowu,
where Ehrentried has a hie very. Hu was supposed t •
be on a steam voyage to Auckland, but suddenly turned
up at home He and others declared they saw Mrs. E
struggling in Gudgeon’s arms, and that Mrs. E whs
yelling out all she knew for help. Tho brewer kicked
Gudgeon out, and had him arrested. Now, G. is ac-
quitted.
The inquest upon the twenty-two men lost in the
Creawick mining disaster resulted in a verdict ascribing
the deaths to an error of judgment on the part of the
mining mamger, partly resulting from a mistake in the
survey. This is tantamount to “ Nobody to blame " —
not evea Providence, this time. A similar flooding has
since occurred in the Wandiligong Deep Lead Com-
piny's mine, and four men's lives were jeopardised. Ic
a pilot is supposed to know every current, shoal, or rook
of the harbour or river he undertakes to work, should
not a mining manager be held responsible for ignorance
of adj uoent dangerous abandoned workings ?
The man Collins, who was found guilty, in West
Australia, of the murder of Kng, at Albany, when
asked by the judge why sentence of death should not be
pissed upon him, said, after vehemently reiterating his
protestations of innocence: “ It you pa-’S sentence upon
me, out off my head like that man’s head was cut off,
and my legs, and put them in the ground for six weeks
just for the information of the public.” His meaning
was that the identification of King had been farcial,
and that, if the decapitated and unlegged trunk were
not that of King, who might be still alive, he (C dims)
was being judicially murdered. Whose are they ?
The Hamilton-Priestly murder sensation at
Auckland, (N Z ), whion wa« very muoh Uke onr Kinder
case, has resulted in an acquittal. The facts were clear
to far That Mrs. Hamilton and Priestly were lovers,
and criminally erred against the deceased Mr. Hamilton.
That the latter was found dead with a wound in tho
heed, in his own bedroom. That Priestly’s movements
on the night in question were suspicious. The medical
evidence let out that the wound might have been caused
by a fall against the knob of a bedstead, which was.
substantially, the defence. The theological Priestly
can now marry his angular, hard-featured paramour.
Under Mr. Dailey’s Criminal Law Consolidation
Bill, any schoolmaster (Uke the ruffian Plomer) who
violates a girl pupil under IS years of ago. and any
boastliko father who carnally knows his daughter, under
the same ago, will be unable to plead consent as a
defence to a criminal charge. This is, as Pecksniff
would say, “ a soothing reflecuion but a great deal of
the “soothe” ia ruboed out by the erasing fact that
the death penalty is no part of the clause in the Bill.
The risk run—that ia the proper way to put it for
Plomers, “ the risk run!"—in only 10 years penal servi-
tude; and tho penalty for an unsuccessful attempt at
any similar seduction is only 5 years. Yet, in the bar-
baric land of yellow-skinned Mongolians they chip off
a Chinese sausige-maker’s head it he steals a puppy
dog.
We have been favoured with a proof copy of
the regulations for intending exhibitors in Jules
Joubart’s latest spec.—the International Exhibition to
bo opened at Calcutta on December 4 next. All ex-
hibits will be admitted duty tree The rules are pretty
welt t n all-fours with those that governed the Austra-
lian exhibitions run by Joubert and Twopeny. Wo
notice that certificates of gold—now, Christchurch,
keep quiet—silver, and bronze, are to ne awarded. The
executive of the fska “will be glad to receive, as a
•loan,’ any paintings, statuary, bronzes, or works of
art, possessing snffljient merit or originality to be at-
tractive.” Ibis Use condition is somewhat vague
What inventor ever manufactured anything, even a
pointed stick or a tip cat, that did not “possess suffi-
cient merit or orig.natity to bo attractive?” These,
unlike most, “loans" will be negotiated “free of
charge." The exbio. will close on or about March
1, ISfii.
This simple par will be gall for the Penny
Alien of King-street It is from the Cooktown
Herald With their ChrLtmas number, tbo pro-
prietors of tbe Sydney Bulletin present a welldriwn
and capitally coloured lithograph, entitled ‘a Pros-
pector’s (Jhnstmie Morning in the far North.’ The
blacks have sururised two men and speared one while
cooking breakfast. The mate is rushing out with rifle
ia naud, and iha look of agony on tha one face and of
determination and revenge on the other, together
w.th the bush scenery, and the attitudes of the blacks
will bo but too familiar to many ahatdy Cook pioneer ’
The Port Douglas Times says:—” Each of the
above mentioned journals (the Town and Country
and the Sydney Mail) has a pictorial supplement,
but for these we must give the palm to tbs one issued
by the Sydney Bulletin, entitled, * The Prospector a
Christmas morning in the far North.’ Two miners
have been rudely disturbed by the blacks : one lies on
his back with h's face upturned to the sky, and a spear
through his chest, while his mate with a rifle in bis
hand is defending nimaeif Spaars are flying about in
all directions, and the blacks are visible moving among
the trees. It is at once a startlingpicture of real life —the
more startling neoause of iis contrast, to the usual
peacefulness of Christmas moaning.” We may observe
to the people up North that they need not look out for
the next Christmvj number of the Alien. Tread
lightly.
A fearful record. At Albury, on Sunday week,
a boy named Edwards, aged 13, sun of a widow of PslJ-
timber Creea, near Wodonva, Vie , got into a current
while bathing in the Rivor Mumy, aid was drowned.
At the same place, on the following Tuesday, four gen-
tleman went for their matutinal bathe. C. H Friend,
one of them, was teaching a lad named Cuhen, aged 14
years to swim Friend took Cohen out on his back;
Cohen lost his nerve and both tht”'r lives At Glen
Innes, on Saturday, a man named Quinn was showing
tw i companions how far he could dive in the oret k ; he
dived into the rooks and never came up at all. Swag-
man named James Scott was found drowned iu the
Little River ; else of d. t. iNear i'entertield, a bullock-
rhiver named James Jordan, son of Thomas Jordan, oi
Deap C eek, Lawrence Road, followed one of his
huliooks into the Six-mile Swamp. The bullock left
him there. At Waterloo last Friday, Henry Harris
Archer, a boy, was fooling with a dead fish round a
watarholo. Ho thiught he'd take a turn at being the
fish, while tho dead fl*h pliyed the fool. His nature
wasn't adap’ed to it,and poor lad was dead when brought
rut Up Grafton way, Monday two boys aged 8 and
10 years, son of a farmer named Lane, started to bathe
in the upper rivtr opposite Eitonsville station, and
forgot they couldn't swim. They can’t swin any better
now. At Morago, near Dsniliquin, same day, young
man named Thomas Boll, aged 3u years, took two child-
ren for a row on the E iwards River. He started from
one shore, the boat upset, and he successfully pulled
himself and the children to the other side oj the grave.
RIP. If this new mania for aquatic feats d'.velopes
much more, drowning will soon be -is much of a national
pastime as cricket. Si’iously spaikiug, oughtn’t we
to encourog) sw.mming to a much greater extent than
we do P
VANITY FAIR.
A student of divinity at a late examination was
askid how long Sarah had to wait for a son and heir.
He said be supposed “about the usual time." The
m t.hetic craze may now be considered as completely
vtoru out in England. Japanese and Early English are
n > longer worshipped, and everything quaint and shape-
less is ot j ictionable. It is vulgar now to wear sage-
green; u u not elegant to bo limp; and the clinging
garmen's that “ expressed " the figure have given way
to t he crinolette, winch distorts it The question of
white or black necktie for a man’s evening dress is
alw-ys an op.n one. It is a matter of taste, not of law.
But it is imperative that gloves should match. For in-
stance. with white tie, white gloves ; or with black tie,
white gloves, because black and white are complimen-
tary to one another. But lavender gloves with black
or white tie are abominable. Lavender or straw neck-
ties with same gloves ore correct, if the wearer prefers
them to others But never mix the colours The

SPORTING AND ATHLETIC MENS.
The veteran sportsman, Mr. John Tait, quits
the turf.
Harriman and O’Leary, the American heel and
toe pedestrians, intend to visit Australia shortly.
,£125 ware handed over to the Creswick Relief
Fund, proceeds of the Melbourne Athletic E aunion.
Mr. James Wilson, of St. Albans, is fast re-
covering from the illness wnioh recently attacked him,
Bundoora, out of Argosy, who is performing
bo well lately in New Zealand, is the only son of tbe
Peer.
Edward Hanlan denies that he has any intention
of leaving Canada and taking up his residence in New
York
The selection committee in connection with the
Intercolonial eight-oar race, had a trial eight out last
week.
A Melbourne paper states it is very unlikely
Mr. Trickett will pull in the coming Intercolonial eight-
oar race.
Australian bred horses are in great form in N.Z.
this season, and so far, have pulled off the maj ority of
the racing events.
Sir Modred, Welcome Jack, Bundoora, and
Somnus, Vanguard, and Salvage, are first favourites for
the Dunedin (N.Z ) Cup.
At intervals during a fortnight of the holiday
season, Mr. E. Bishop of the Fernside Bicycle Club,
Victoria, travelled 6C2J miles.
A Sydney Hebrew book went down to the late
Auckland races, and let the local pencillers and others
in to the extent of £200. He left suddenly.
Before Bonnor left Melbourne, he was presented
with a gold looket and a bat, in recognition of his bat-
ting in the first match against Ivo Bligh’s team.
A swarm of bookmakers |oame over with the

ing on this week’s match than ever took place on
Bind wick.

Bates, for his magnificent bowling against the
Australians in the match recently played in Melbourne,
was presented with nearly 100 sovereigns. The amateurs
of the English team subscribed 50 of them.
The yacht race between the Oithona and Sirocco,
to have been sailed last Saturday, was postponed in
canseqnenoe of damage done to the Oithona on Friday.
The race will most likely come off next Saturday.
The Handicap Race for half-decked boats, in
connection with the Sydaey Amateur Sailing Club,
cima off on Saturday, and resulted in a win for the
Fleetwing, which beat the E thel by about four minutes.
The Gippsland Gun Club champion, Mr. Harry
Eeynolds. recently shot, at Matfra, 23 birds without a
miss at 30 yards. This is the best shooting that has
taken plaoe in the colonies.
At Melbourne, on the 18th, our W. L. Murdoch
won the pigeon match for Mr. Virgoo’s trophy—a hnn-
dioap at nine birds each. William, at 28 yards’ rise,
potted all his birds without a miss.
Nicholson, on Morpeth, took it rather too easily
at the finish of the Anniversary Handicap, and nearly
made a mistake. Sardonyx came with a great rush, and
was in front a stride past the post.
“Cloanthua,” in the Australasian, gives the

The bookmakers are not to bo “fenced in” on
the Caulfield course. The A.J.C. committee have

Ivo Bligh has fallen in love with our cricket

In the saddling paddock at Eandwick, on Fri-
day, an unseemly brawl took place between a cabman
and a member of a North Shore bruising family, a lady
having to interfere before the combatants could be
separated. Of course, a policeman could not be found.
The Meyera-George races ended in an unseemly
wrangle, and, from disclosures made, it seems that both
these men have been receiving a portion of tbe gate

A cricket match was played at Bathurst on
Saturday between the Liedertafel anda local team. The
Liedertafel went in first, and made a total of 59—Woods
16, Gilgillan 20, P. P. Brewer 13. Bathurst made 87 for
the loss of four wickets, when rain came on and put a
stop to the game.

How nre the mighty fallen! Mr. Sangar, the
well-known English circus proprietor, recently sold the
eretwbi'e racehorse Somerset for two sovereigns. As a
two-year-old, Somerset was a flyer, winning some of the
principal races in England, inolnding the July Stakes,
and was sold to Lord Lonsdale for £2000.
The committee in connection with the handicap
outrigger race at Grafton have decided that, in the
event of less than six entries being received, the race
shall be rowed in one heat; if more than six, in two
heats. Messrs. N, Ijookyer and P. J, Clarke have oon«
sented to act as bandicappers.
The Braidwood Annual Races promise to be a
success on February 8 th and 9th. The gate and booths
realised good prices. They expect this to be their best
meeting. Snavoller’s win, “The Moruya Cup," was
hailed with dolignt in Braidwood, his owner, Mr. John
Wallace, being very popular there.
An idea of the terrific pace and the wonderful
endurance required for such a performance as Commo-
tion and Guesswork’s in the Champion Stakec, three
miles, may bo formed when it is considered that an
average of 1 minute 48 2 3 seconds per mile is required
to make the time it was run in, viz., 5min. 26sec.
At Heathoote (N.Z.) races the sum of <£231)0
passed through the totalisator. In one of the races,
the Maiden Plato, a dividend was paid on the winner in
the inside, whilst in the outside there were 115 inves-
tors, and not one on the winner, which was Mr. H.
Hawkins’ mare Awatere. an aged daughter of Sledmerf.
People differ in their opinions as to what con-
stitutes enjoyment. The Wellington (N.Z.) Times’
report of the Porirua races says.—“During the after-
noon the tide rose, and three or four of the races wore
run with the water (at the back of the course) close up
to the horse’s girths. The races may be said to be one
of the most enjoyable of our country meetings.”
Mr. T. F. Walker, of Albert Park R.C., has
decided to settle permanently in Sydney. Mr. Walker a
best performance in Victoria was at the Albert Park
Eegatta, Senior Sculls—when he defeated Johnstone
and Beal, the Victorian Amatenr Champion. Mr.
Walker has joined the Balmain B.C., and is a likely
starter for the Krug Champagne Trophy, to be towed
for in June.

At her oastle in Wales, Adelina Patti, prima-

In the race for the Waitara J.C. Handicap at
New Plymouth (N.Z ), the jockey (Tucker) of St. Clair,
was plainly seen to deliberately pull his horse, and Lord
of the Hills (same owner as first horre) was allowed to
win. Tucker has got his reward—disqualification for
ever (pretty stiff that), and the owner has been 1 fined
£10 for not declaring to win with Lord of the Hills.
At Balaoiutha (N.Z.) sports, the tug of war
nearly developed into something serious, as the contes-
tants who engaged to do battle for their respective sides
could not command their temper, and at one time it
looked as if a regular—or rather an irregular—bruising
match was to be the final wind-up of the games.
Nothing came Of it, however, but a deal of “ barney-
ing.’*
Hanlan, the oarsman, and Rowell and Hazael
the pedestrians, recently visited a bow ing alley in New
York. Schmidt, an expert bowler, in charge of the
alley, challenged either of the three men to roll him
first three in five games, thinking ho had a soft thing
on. Hanlan took up the gauntlet. Schmidt won the
first game, but the sculler won the three following and
the match.
In the Leger enclosure at Randwiok, on Friday,
the promoters of the 5a. pools were fairly rushed on
every event, and the small books suffered accordingly.
We should like to see the Totalisator legalised in New
South Wales. The backers of horses would get better
odds, and what an improvement a well-managed
machine would be upon the hoarse-y croakings of some
bookmakers in the saddling paddock.
When Messenger swamped his outrigger in the
race on Friday, Beach, upon passing him, made some
very nasty remarks, in not over select language. It is
to be hoped the successes of this promising sculler have
not carried him “ off his head." However, he halloo'd
before he was out of the bush, as his own boat shortly
afterwards filled, and Messenger, sitting astride of his
oraft, with his slide in his mouth, managed to paddle
her in stern first to the winning post.
An American paper, in speaking of trotting in
Australia, says: “ The people nave become infatuated
with trotting, and tne man who takes over a few good
ones can not only make it a paying speculation on the
race-track, but can get good prices for his stock if he
desires to sell. An open invitation to visit these regions
has long been extended, and it will be very uncharacter-
istic of this pushing nation if it is not accepted.
Another meeting will be given in March, with hand-
some premiums. As Mr. Micawber remarked, the dist-
ance is a more trifle."
At Greymouth, N.Z,, while running in the Mid-
summer Handicap, one of the competitors, liawdou,
fell and quite disabled himself, while another horse
named Dan O’Connell bolted off the course, crashing
through a fence and linearly killing a man and a boy, a
trick he repeated twice on the same day. What brought
Eawdon down is hard to say. It may have been a
stumble, or, as some think, that ho burst a blood-vossol
and fell; but, at auy rate, be seemed very much shaken,
with blood pouring out of his nostrils, and a lameness
as if his spine was injured.
Thus an American paper : —It cannot be said
that the Australians are lax in their racing laws. Mr.
De Mestro, the gentleman who owns Navigator, the
recent winner of the Darby, was lately flood £5 for
violating, them by running his Eobinson Crusoe filly
unnamed. Tboir law on this point is very explicit, Itule
5) stating : “ Auy person running »n unnamed horse on
the course shall pay a penalty of £5 for every time he
shall so run such horse." Wa arc disposed to think
favorably of this rule, and urge its adoption by the
American Jockey Club.
“ Spue’’ tells the following good story of the
Maori horse in the Hack Eace at the late Opaki (Wel-
lington, N Z ) races:—“The horse, a pot-bellied brute,
with long and shaggy patches of hair all over him, had
bieu running inside the course during the day, and his
owner entered him while in a state of excitement,
caused, no doubt, by the sport and sundry waipiraus.
A gentleman who had been very lucky in the tolalisator
spotted him, and, after chaffing the owner, said, ‘ Well,
I’ll lay a note on him for his ugliness." As is already
known, the scrubber won, and the man who wanted to
throw away a pound raked in the whole piool of £G9."
At Pittsburg, U.S., T. Johnson and M. Phelan
ran a ten-mile footrace for £200. Johnson won, but
Phelan, who came in about a quarter of a mile behind,
claimed a foul, and Eph Morris, the well-know sculler,
who was referee, reserved his decision till next day,
when ho decided in favour of Phelan. The friends of
Johnson turned on Morris, and, after locking the doors,
set apon him and punished him very severely. Several
, pistols were drawn, but were not used, and finally,
after police assistance had been called, the assaulting
party withdrew. Morris’ injuries are not of a danger-
oas character*
Messrs Hobbs and Goodwin of New Zealand,
appear to have u peculiar manner of working the total-
isitor. The Press thus describes the doings in con-
nection with the Trotting Race at the Hoathoote meet-
!—Lunatic at once getting into his stride was soon
at the head of aifairs and won easily. Much dissatis-
faction was expressed by many at the inside totalisator
not closing as soon as the start was effected. Those in
a position quickly realised there was nothing in the
race excepting Lunatic, and a most unseemly rush was
thereupon made to the totalisator in thehopeof getting
on. When the horses started there were only 17 tioseta
taken out on Lunatic, but those, before the closing of
the machine, were swollen to 36,
The Rockhampton Jockey Club races must have
been particularly lively, judging from the following
incidents. The clerk of the course was dismissed on
tbe spot owing to gross misbehaviour. The winner of
the Hurry Skuny was found to be Little Dick, a racer,
instead of a hack. Three jockeys were disqualified fer a
drunken row. A heavy weight horse owner and a
lockey had a sharp turn-up ; one of the stewards was
with difficulty stopped from ditto with a resident j and,
to finish up, a great hulking fellow knocked bis mate
down and nearly Smashed his head in with a stock-
whip handle. Now this is a country meet if you like.
Murdoch objected to Barlow bowling on Friday,
on the ground that the] Englishman had steel bars on
ms shoes, which cut up the wicket. The umpires up-
held the Australian captain’s appeal, and Barlow had to
change his boots. The Australian Eleven now attribute
their defeat in Melbourne to Barlow’s shoes, which cut
up the turf, and gave Bates such an advantage in the
bowling. Wo give •* Our Boys ’* the following ad-
vice .—
Too much 11 tucker” will unhinge ye,
*' Swiping," too. will do the same,
Do not go and “ bust your bingey,*’
When you have to play a game.
During the trip from England of a certain Aus-
traliau Eleven, the hygienic effects of a sea trip being
under discussion, a lengthy member of the team, who
weighed fully 12it., stated he would not weigh list, ou
his arrival in Australia. Another member offered to
lay him £56 to half-i-sov. he would bring down the
scales at 11 and a half. Whereupon the long-up threw
down a halt sov. to bind the wager. The layer of the
£50 some days afterwards noticed the lengthy one was
looking more than usually lank and determined to watch
him. He was rewarded by finding that there was an
American reducing machine on board, which the long-nn
had been using like a very 11 Demon” since the making
of the bet. It is needless to say the wager was declared
off
Barlow, the cricketer, is about the broadest
“ Lancashire " wo ever saw. He had a grievance the
other day at the matob, and we had the pleasure of
getting wet while we listened to it j and then, when we
had listened to it, we had to go and bunt up another
"Lancastrian " to tell us what it was all about. It was
about the spike ehiefly, which Barlow wore on the heel
of his sh.ee, and which was at the last moment objected
to, by Murdoch, who had, however, allowed it to bo
worn in the two preceding matches. This spike is
about as muoh like a spike as a cow is like a coffee-mill,
being a big plate of steel standing, so to speak,on three
curved legs of the same metal. Mr. Barlow having ex-
hausted the spike snbjaot, presented ns with a work oa
cricket, 11 with the author's compliments." It is a fine
little work, full of learned diagram. And should be in-
valuable to those who are fond of cricket. Wo are not
fond of cricket.
At the Dunedin (N.Z ) Caledonian Games there
was immense interest taken in the wrestling (border
style) on account of the meeting of Strong and his old
opponent, the balfcaite Robertson. On hold being
obtained, neither man gained any appreciable advantage
for some time. Strong at length, however, put the
back crook upon his opponent and both went down,
Robutteon sucoeding by n last effort in getting the
champion underneath. For the second fall, the men
were looked for nearly three minutes before any throw
was obtained, and the tunnel was a most obstinate and
evenly matched one. The halfoaate had at first the
best of the hold, but Strong gradually improved hi#
position, and eventually gained the fall by a ueat cross-
buttock. The third fall also went in favour of Strong,
Robertson being thrown upon hi# knees and loosening
his hold.
The members of the Amorioan P.R. —and John
L. Sullivan in particular— are trying their best to
relegate boxing to a place among the lost arts. At an
entertainment given in Washington, U.S., the manage-
ment offered £190 to any man who would stand before
"Sully" for twelve minutes. A blacksmith named
Rentyler, who had never had the gloved on but once
previously, undertook to earn the money. At the first
pass Sullivan knocked him down, and at the end of one
minute and a-half, when Rentyler was getting up from
his knees, Sullivan brutally struck him on the nose,
when the police put a stop to the proceedings. The
following is a two weeks’ record of 'Frisco bruisers—
Maynard whipped in a brawl at the race track, his
brother whipped in a quarrel on Bush-street, Lawlor
arrested lor stabbing a man, Riley whipped in a brawl
on Bush-street, Savage whipped in seventeen seconds by
a New York sailor.
0 wing to the counter attractions on Anniversary
Day, the attendance at the Sydney Turf Club Races was
only fair. The Flying Handicap was won by Ad Valorem,
Hypatia 2, Judith 3. For the Turf Club Cup, Needle
led into the straight, but Caractaons, staving off a rush
by Sportsman, won by a lengi k and a-half, Needle 3. The
Hurdle Race fell to the unthought-of Whitly. All the
other starters fell. First Try was quickly remounted
and went in chase, but Whitly had too long a lead, and
won by some twelve length*. For the Anniversary
Handicap, Morpeth lad into tbe straight, and looked an
easy winner, but Sardonyx came with a groat rush and
made a great race of it. Morpeth winning l-,y a bare
head. Jessie was third, though not placed by the
judge. Ildagonda won tne January stakes by a bare
head from Jessie, Le Grand third. For the Bolling
Plate Fbyilia and Stella had a fine race up the straight,
which ended in a victory for Phyllis by a ueok, Musjid
third. The Ladies' Bracelet fell to Caractaons, who
beat Cetewayo by a neck. Bandmaster third.
The ten-mile race at the Dunedin (N.Z.) Caledo-
nian Sports, was won by the scratch man O’Connor.
W. J Burk, who received 220 yards, was second, and
Cunningham, 260 yards, third. Ten others started.
Time for the 10 miles, 57 min. 2 sea, with a strong wind
blowing. The first milo was completed by the scratch
man in 5.13, the second in 5.37, third 5 31J. The four
miles took 22.10; five miles, 27.38; six miles, 33.25;
seventh mile, 39 21. In tbe third lap of the last mile
Cunningham, who had run most gamely throughout, at
last showed slight signs of distress, and was passed by
O'Connor and Burk, the former at the same time draw-
ing a good 20 yards away from the Otago champion.
As the last lap was entered upon the excitement was
intense. Burk put on a spurt to cat down the scratch
man if possible, bat the latter was well able to respond,
and had a great deal too much pace left in him to give
his opponent a chance. Ho finished up the straight at
a slashing rata of spaed some 25 yards ahead of Burk,
who did not appear particularly distressed. Cunning-
ham ran easily in for third place, and Brooks was
fourth.
THE GREAT MATCH.
After all our bounce and blow,
TOnndurl what a holy show.
Gruel for the groat eleven,
Murdoch 0, and Qiffen seven.
Garrett 0, pure bad lack,
Bonnor eight, and Mao "a duck."
Spottorth, lock ou this—oh Heaven I
Ties with Gillen, one big seven.
Palmer two, oh, sorry fate,
Horan “ run out,” hang it 1 eight.
Little Aliok he did strive
To top the score and got a five.
Only one did shape to *' whack ’otn,"
Twenty-six, and fancy—Blaokham.
11-,’s all over. Bligh has gone.
With his ashes we’re forlorn.
Familiar with us is the sup
Of the hyssop—bitter cup.
Wo don’t take our gruel well.
Cannot stand this awful sell—

To vii-e of cricket nevermore.

At Haverhill races, U.S., information was given
to the stewards that a horse was disguised, and upon
examination by experts—two barbers—who were pre.
sent, it was fonnd that the hair was oolonrad from
white to black brown (as it appeared then), upon both
hinds logs, that a star in his forehead had been coloured

SOCIAL.
Counter attractions affected the attendance on
the Regatta fiigship on Anniversary Diy. But as there
were plenty of comfortable seats, and bright-looking
women, and two bands on board, and a good luueh, and
the wayward weathar had cleared up oa purpose for
the holiday, existence was quite endurable, even with-
out a crowd. His Excellency's brief visit gave a chance
for some of the new Ministers to make little speeches,
about what a nice country this is, and how beautifully
it is governed; and between the races people paraded
the big City ot Sydney, and sat on the velvet cushions
of it t “ social hail," and poked into its large saloons
and little cabins, and felt themselves at free and wel-
come as if she had bean their own. Visitors came and
went all the time. A pure white cashmere, jwif-h deep
box-plaited flounces and alternate squire puffings ot
-cardinal satin, cardinal front and hem, under a white
pearl boided hat and feathers, was a nice summer dress.
A consul’s daughter was in blue-grey beige, trimmed
•with dark blue, and wore a white laoo jockey hat, which
isuitcd her handsome face but not her costume. An-
other lady from tbe heme of tbe screeching eagle wore
a navy blue satin skirt and flowing sash, with an elastic
3 irsey bodice to match, prinoasse bonnet over blonde
hair, and brown suede gloves Several oomoiuations of
check with whole-coloured fabrics were seen ; one, a
giey chock panier bodice over prune sateen skirt, set
off with lace, being worn by a graceful girl, A stone-
coloured beige suited a s nail lady : is had narrow kill-
ings, and ruche round the knees, and was a most satis-
factory fit; her poke hat was filled by cardinal roses
and a charming faoe. Two sisters wore pretty light
fawn cashmeres, one adding effect with ficelle brocade,
the other with sage groan brocade trimming. 'Tne
wearer of a rose-pick sateen, all in narrow kilted
flounces, with white net panier and collar, was as gay
as a tin soldier. Bronze nun’s veiling, with jacket body
and three-flounce skirt, was worn by a young !ady who
supported an "over-the-gardan-wali” hat, turned up
with rnby velvet to show a fresh pretty faoe, and
strapped quaintly across the crown and under the ohin
with ruby ribbon.

Fashionable wedding at St. Mark’s on the 24th
January. Mr Arthur Henry Savage was united to
Miss Florence Carey, youngest daughter of Mr Charles
uedye, of “Eastbourne,” Darling Point. The petite
bride wore a superb white satin dress with broobe front
made plain with the exception of a fan-shaped flounce
and very long train, and the skirt so tightly drawn that
the journey up the aisle req lired much time and care.
Three of the bridesmaids, Misses Minnie Qedye, Mylne,
and Roxborough, wore handsome dresses of pick satin
body, pointed side drapery showing pretty front skirt
of white India muslin with numerous flounces each
edged with lace, long train, wreath ot pink and white
daisies, and each young lady carried a bouquet. Two
little maids, Mtseo-i Mildred and Lulu Finley, wire
simply clad in white India muslin and laee, pink
sashes, silk stockings ami shoes, and oarrixi giliei
boskets of ferns and flower*. Mrs. Godje's drtss was
a magnificent combination of peach satin and brocade,
witb long train, bonnet en suite ; and Mrs Finley’s was
cream satin, long sweeping train, pretty brown bonnst.
Lady Robertson wore black moire, and cream bonnet;
and Mrs. Roxborough a handsome black satin and
trimmed with steel passementerie Mrs. Bou-
verie's short dross of peach satin and plush was pretty
and stylish Mrs. A. Le Patourel wore black and
white striped satin Other costumes among the many
rich ones exhibited in the church were; a Use cream
silk with cardinal trimmings, bonnet th march, on a
tall, de.rk lady; a grey satin with long train, elegant; a
short dress of two shades of steel silk, novel and gen-
teel : and a simple white lawn or muslin, with wnite
satin hut, studded witb pearls, white feather drooping
over the side, and a white satin belt. An exceedingly
handsome dross of brown satin da lyon, long train,
cream lace collar and shaded brown bonnet; also a
striped orotm satin with satin hat, were noticeable.
An arch in front of the altar was decorated with
Ohristmas-bush, ferns, and lilies; and a lady played
remarkably well on the organ. The bandsmen of the
Permanent Artillery, of which the bridegroom la lieu-
tenant, played during the evening at “ Eastbourne,”

With that scrupulous adherence to truth which
is the guiding principle of every member of our staff —
except our poets—we can safely say that the scene on
the Association Ground last Friday was unprecedented.
We have been on the ground every time anyone else
has, ever since the scrub was out away, and we never
saw anything like it By twelve o'clock the whole
ground was as busy with the moving throng as an angry
ant bod, and the members' reserve and the stand were
(all. By a quarter past, ladies walked up and down
seeking rest for the soles of their feet, and finding
none. By half-past, they gave np a 1 hope of scats, and
eank humbly down on the steps, or stood aroand,
etatues of limp loveliness, wherever there was room.
Considering that for a weak prior the Peapos and Shaw
young men bad beau harassed to comparative skeletons,
showing the season's goods, and The Palaoo hud
been almost fenced In with a corral of cabs and
carriages, the display mile by the sweeter half ot
creation was not extraordinary Certainly the crowd
wa* so great that the display con’d only be made under
disadvantages, and in tbe stand fatly two thirds of the
occupant* were men—brought there by genuine interest
in the great match —instead of the usual larger propor-
tion of women and millinery. And scats were very
preoieas ; men were not anxious to earn a name for
politeness at tbe cost ot losing the sight they had come
oarly on purpose to see i and no lady—unless her
apparel was quite new and ultra attractive—oared to
risk her seat Dy a parade oa the green. Whits linen or
lawn, plaid cambrics, and checks, and cashmere)
wore plentiful. Two daughters of a bank man-iger
from North Shore were in white lawn, with dark
easbes. Nicer than almost any other dresses, were two
cream cashmeres, richly trimmed with cream broohcS.
flrripes of it being lot in back and front ot bodice; lace
edging and laoa hats. With a C artndon Terrace doc-
tor, who lately oosamltted matrimony, was a lady in
(awn satin polonaise, brown check underskirt wi h long
kilting*; and a companion in black silk and A
daughter of the "oldest captain," from Balmain, wore
a nicely fitting black oashmere, moire sash, kilted
llounoes,black beaded fringe and the invariable poke hat
Bright golden bronze and ficelle lace came on a tall lady
from Darlinghur-t; and another dress of meiic was
olive green satin bodice and trimmings, with skirt of
white nearing a green flowered pittern Slate silk and
broohi 4 ; floeilo nun’s veiling and broohd, helped with
gold passementerie; cream cashmere and gold passe-
menterie, with tight upper sleeves and collarette of
canary yellow; a gathered silver grey pompadour and
•atin de lyon, were all pretty. A blonde wore polcmise
of light flowered foulard and bright blue silk skirt; and
a pretty face peered above a mass of white satin an 1
broohe, lace, and pearl collarette, set off with white
peirlad bonnet and crush cardinal roses. A pair of the
showiest dresse*. but yet in good taste, were creim
satin, touched off with brilliant cardinal and cream
jBpanish lace, and iaoed up the back with cardinal euro ;
cream gloves and jaunty hats. And the warmest was a
combination of satin, velvet, and fringe, with a head-
dr iss also, of deep violet. Many heads turned to look
after it—and her. That’s a fair sample of theature;
du -, as wo have already felt it our duty to obsarve, Mono
•rare remaikable. Fasuion had no show oa Saturday at
*11. Oa Monday, however, it was different; there was
,au excellent display, and society faces wore in abund-
ance, A trio of creams were magnificent. Two were
similar, cream brock.(S pointed bodies, into which was
gathered nun’s veiling panier, and broobe tablier in
front and voluminous drapery behind. The rich broohtS
was fuither embellished with cplendid white passe-
meitrrie and silk work. Tbe tuird was also creim
hraoh6, but made with long square-p3inted tunic, aid
b.uig witb rows of fine lace. The flips of tunic we 'e
th* leaked with beading, and were a mass of sumptuous
oUren embroidery, opening out to disclose striped satin
(roai and lace. All fsiei ladies wore brunets of yellow
blossom and green leaves, a pretty fair girl wire a
white tweed, tight toly, three flannoe skirt, and cream
striped satin sash ; brown lace hat. Olive greea satin,
r ob, and crowelled in natural coloured wa eriiiies and
leaves, worn by the wife of a IBrUbane dco or. Ind go
satin, beaded, and pink roses, nio . A heavy marouu
yiatiu hid ali the underskirt draped with broad white
lace, a strong contrast; white lace bmnet. A lady
leading a little girl in bine, combined bltok silk and
Hit in with one of the sweetest faces. Buttercups were
l-esa on the hat and neck of the blonde lady
nbO'8 white dress was looted with buttercup
ribbms ; rather a pretty conceit, we thought.
Throe daughters of a Woollahra member all
pretty la pompadours and garden hits, A handsome
married lady looked her best in cream cambric and lace,
blus sash, and large hat shading an envied complexion.
Rnby silk and broobe, hat and parasol all matching,
was very elegant. An attractive dress was of blick
damascene moire trimmed with shrimp pink satin and
covered with black Spanish laoe; bonnet of white jet
and daisies, from Vioboria-streeb. A member’s wife, a
recognised leader of stylo, was quietly attired in black
silk and satin, and laca; and the wife of an Bn-t Sydney
member in dainty dross and hat, all white An admired
married belle from St Leonards wore an iuco ispicu >us
though neat costume of black silk and satin, with fawn
bonnet; and her handsome relative, of a darker type of
beauty, also from St Leonards, wore only white. Lady
Jennings, quiet black cashmere; her daughter, a pretty
white costume. Peach satin and b och6 was dainty.
There were numerous other good dresses; and thee
ware many well-known ladies who were not prominent.
This is a subtle compliment; because some oidsige
one said somewhere that when there is nothing re-
markable about a lady’s attire, then sho must be we.l.
dressed.

Mr. Fred. Ginnon, solicitor, of King-street,
played the host to some 2K) guests at a picnic, last
Friday, at Tempo H mse, Cook's River. Tne invitation
cards were extremely pretty, and well worth keeping as
souvenirs of the day. Choi/e costumes were worn by
some of the ornamental portion of the guests; while
others were plainer, but still charming, and just suited
for picnic larks. Oompagnoni did tae du>u»r. and, if
anyone was shy, champagne and wines ad lib, soon
loosened the tongues and lit the oyes of the merry com-
pany. In the Italian villa recitations and musical
pieces were given, and dancing was oartiea on to the
accompaniment of the Mercantile Band. Mr. John
Young proposed the neal h of the host and hostess.
Mrs Gannon attended to the comforts of visitors,
especially young one*, who wera dose I into a state of
happy repletion with j allies, custards, and similar
dainties. Her eldest daughter 1-iokod bewitching in
sage green pompadour, hat to match; while Miss Ada
was lily-iUo in pure white, a pretty visitor from
Braid wood was in figured sateen, blue ;sash; a leading
auctioneer’s daughter wore a cool dress that might be
oallei an ice era m; and her sister's raiment was
becoming gray—we hops It will be a long time before
we sav that of the young wearer. Two fair sisters
from Forest Lodge shone in white lustre; and artistic
costumes of cream and garnet came from Burwood and
from North Shore. Nithsdals sent a beautiful dancer
in light blue and black; Kmtville, an elegant costume
of cream and figured satin ; Leichhardt, two fair sisters
in palest biue; and Crown-street, two sisters in ooa-
trastiug dresses of similar cut. Black brocaded satin,
and a heart-shaped diamond looket of great beauty were
worn by a solicitor a wife. We believe tbe handsomest
drosses were worn by two sisters from Church Hill:
the elder in a regal cream satin elviwrately furnished,
a perfect triumph of dressmaking; the younger in a
toilet equally handsome of pile rosopink, bonnet to
match. Juab in the gloaming, about 80 couples dan ri-d
a q ladril.e on the greau (i dance specially sanctioned
by the «ev. Congregational Jama'j in front of the villa,
and it wai a most picturesque scene; the placid river,
the shadowy trees, and the forms that flitt d about
indistinctly “between the lights,’’ to the sounds of
merry laughter and tinkling mu-no. combining to make
a perfect representation oi an Australian midiummer
night's dream.

Henry V. kiss which made Miss Carlyon leave the
(Stevens Dramatic Company. It seen s that in •* Pas-
sion’s Slave," Miss Carlyon requires, as a matter of
business of course, to be ii sad. Well, stage e iqaette
prescribes that unless the lady givas special p irmiesion,
the kiss must be on the ear, cheek, or forehead ; any-
where, in fact, except the pUce where it’s real'y good
Stevens, however, being a man of taste, pref r:ed the
genuine article, and insisted on a ful'-sized Henry V.
on the lips. This is how the lady explained the
matter:—*' We oill It the Henry V. kiss because it is
the one Rignold uses in that play. As he does it, it is
not so bad; but Mr Stevens is not the actor that
Rignold is, and the oomeqmnca is that every time he
uses the kiss the whole house titters, and there is a
suggestion of indelicacy about it that is eery amoving.
Now, don’t imagine that I am a prude, for I am not. I
delight in love scenes on the stage, but there is art and
there is awkwardness." “ But," said the polite re-
r’i^?it?tiDgly ’ I or Misa Carl y° n wa s a particularly
pretty little lady, and married moreover, and he felt he
was on delicate ground, “ I don’t quite understand. Is
.. irr } 3 to 8a y* is there anything special
.hT 61, 8he .. bla ? h ed and laughed, "what we call the
Henry V* kiss in England is this- The grmlemau
comes behind the lady, and puts both his hands over
her shoulders on her cheeks, so that the fingers meet
just beneath the ohin. Then he palls her head back to
his shoulder, and kisses her fully on the lip=, keeping
u 8 fco hers for fullv minute*. Of o**mse *•
she added. “ I never asked him to do it on the cheek ’-r
ear instead. I wouldn t mind about the M*s if it didn’t
put mo in such an absurd light. Tae idea of wanting
to be kissed on the ear is positively dreadful. I don’t
knowr how people can imagine such things.**
An American paper objects to Mrs. Langtry
because her feet are of the "familiar English mould.-’
Well, we have seen several American actresses out hero
whoso feet might have been run out in a feuder mould,
if there were such a thing One in particular we know,
whosv feet were of such aiert that she couldn’t turn
the corner of a lane without first backing into the
street. And when we made a casual mention of this
act, she haughtily informed us that we hsd “ gone
beyond the pale of dramatic criticism ” On the whole,
we prefer the ‘'familiar English mould."

NEMESIS.
THEY LOVE
His cheek was red, his eyes were bine,
His coat of strange device.
His curly hair of golden hue ;
Girls called him “ very nice.”
Some at the B ind to him did freeze.
Some lovel him on the Bloc k,
Sometimes strange maid* his hand would rqueeze
Yet he was hard as rock !
They Die.
His face was fair, his heart was co’d,
And money was his dart ;
H's lady lovers, being sold.
All took another start.
Some fait quite bad, began to rave.
Some wailed and wept by turns.
Some wandered by the rad sea wave.
Some sighed, and took to ferns.
They Revive.
Amongst those maids whose love lay dead,
There went a whisper round,
“ It’s come at list; he’s to be wed 1"
Each girl woke at the sound.
Some cased their ribs in coffin lids.
For whalebone some did search,
Home wore -but decency forbids !
And thus they went to church.
They Have Revenge.
The bridegroom waits, the moment’s near.
The bride has left her carriage;
When two score former loves appear.
And straight forbid the marriage;
Soma laughed; some burst their wooden stays,
They dealt him cruel strokes ;
Then some half sadly went their ways.
And some went home with jokes.
