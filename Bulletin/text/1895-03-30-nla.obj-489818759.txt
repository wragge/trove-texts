THE “KEEPER” PILE PILL
(Registered).
The PROPRIETORS of these Pills are well aware that
there are many remedies (some of them really beneficial)
for this painful disease already in the market, but know-
ing as they do the wonderful success of the “ KEEPER ”
PILL they have no hesitation in placing it in the very
front rank of Curative Medicines.
For years the medicine had only a local and limited
use, but now arrangements have been completed to make
its merits more widely known, and the Australasian
colonies will have an opportunity of sharing with the old
country the benefits of this valuable remedy.
The medicine will be sold on its merits, in confident
assurance that its beneficent action will be a real boon to
sufferers.
It will not cure Piles in old and chronic cases by a single
dose. It will not cure every disease that flesh is heir to,
but it will cure Piles if taken in reasonable time, and
IT WILL GIVE RELIEF IN ALL CASES,
however stubborn and chronic, and the proprietors are
continually in receipt of most flattering and unsolicited
testimonials. Price, 2 6 per box (red label).
The “KEEPER” LIVER PILL.
We constantly find cases of Hemorrhoids which are
complicated with liver trouble, and we have therefore
perfected a Liver Pill to be used alone, or in conjunction
with the “Keeper” Pile Pill. We do not claim tor this,
or for any of our preparations, any marvellous curative
(properties. We simply advise you, if suffering from slug-
gish or torpid liver, to spend 1/3 in a box of “ KEEPER ”
iLIVER PILLS (blue label) and you will not regret it.
The “KEEPER” HEALTH PILL.
If you are worried in business, if you are jaded by over-
work, if you are generally run down from any cause, TRY
'THIS PILL. It is a prince of pick-me-ups. In one size
.only (brown label), 6 6 per box. .
The title the “KEEPER” PILL is registered as our
'trade mark throughout the colonies, and any infringement
'thereof will be promptly dealt with by the sole proprietors,
The JOHN F. TAYLOR COMPANY.

Our Trada is Big 1 Our Store is Big !
Our Ideas are Bi gl\
We get bigger every day; on Saturday night
we are bigger than on the previous Monday,
and on the Wednesday following we are bigger
still. We can’t help growing. We have all the
elements of growth. The soil we are planted in
is good, the climate propitious, the people kind.
We are continually watered by the lifegiving
showers of a nation’s approval. Can anyone
wonder that we grow ?
Our growth is a wonderful thing. People
describe it as magical. There is no magic in it.
Anyone, or any set of people, can do the same if
they do as we have done. But they don’t; they
can’t find the way, charge too much for the privi-
lege of doing business with them, and generally
and deplorably make a mess of the whole affair.
That’s the mischief.
Most People Like XT’s! All Believe in Us!
Not % Pew Swear by Us I
It’s cupboard love. We suit them, make their
money go a long way, and generally render the
path of life an easy one. There’s no sentiment
about it. It’s real biz, and no mistake. In that
way we are beloved throughout Australia, the
measure of affection each one bestows upon us
being gauged by the amount of benefit received.
The more you buy at our store the greater your
liking for us will become, because the more you
invest with us the better dividends you receive.
If living IN THE COUNTRY, send for our

WHAT CURES PIMPLES
The only really successful prevent-
ive and cure of pimples, blotches,
blackheads, red, rough, and oily skin,
and most complexional disfigurations,
is that greatest of all Skin Purifiers
and Beautifiers, the celebrated Cuti-
cura Soap. For irritating and scaly
humors of the scalp, with dry or fall-
ing hair, red, rough hands, chaps,
painful finger ends with shapeless
nails, and simple humors of the skin
and scalp of infancy and childhood, it
is simjily infallible.
CUTICURA SOAP
A marvellous beautifier of world-wide celebrity, CuticurA Soap is simply incom-
parable as a Skin-Purifying Soap, unequalled for the Toilet, and without a rival for
the Nursery. Absolutely pure, delicately medicated, exquisitely perfumed, it produces
the whitest, clearest skin, and softest hands, and prevents inflammation and clogging
of the pores, the cause of pimples, blotches, blackheads, red and oily skin, and most
complexional disfigurations. It derives its remarkable medicinal properties from
CuticurA, the great skin cure, but so delicately are they blended with the purest of
toilet and nursery soap stocks that the result is a medicated toilet soap incomparably
superior to all other skin and complexion soaps, while rivalling in delicacy and sur-
passing in purity the most noted and expensive of toilet and nursery soaps. For the
’prevention of facial blemishes, for giving a brilliancy and freshness to the com-
plexion, and for cleansing the scalp and invigorating the hair, it is without a peer.
Sale greater than the combined sales of all other skin soaps. Sold everywhere. 25 c.
Skins on Fire
with Itching and Burning Eczemas, and other itching,
scaly, and blotchy skin and scalp diseases, are relieved
by a single application, and speedily, permanently, and
economically cured by Cuticura Remedies, the greatest Skin Cures, Blood Purifiers, and
Humor Remedies of modem times. Price: Cuticura, the great Skin Cure, 50 cents; Cuticura
Soap, 25 cents; Cuticura Resolvent, the new Blood Purifier, $l.OO. Prepared by Potter Drug

Dear Bulletin, — Thanks to our social
system every Australian town is more or less
pestered with loafers and thieves. Some especially
vile scoundrels live in Nyngan (N.S.W.). When-
ever a traveller who possesses a good-looking
sheep-dog comes to that town, these. cigarette-
ft! 10 Milliard-sharps watch his camp, and at
the first opportunity the dog is caught (sheep-
dogs are mostly good-tempered) and tied up in
some back-yard until the unfortunate swagman is
either tired of looking for him, or, more fre-
quently, can’t afford to camp any longer. No
sooner lias he cleared than these mean creatures
sell his dog to passing drovers. This trade
nourishes in Nyngan—no less than three travellers
having lost dogs there within the last fortnight.
I once. But where is the policeman who would
stir his feet or take his fab hands out of his
pockets to help a swagman to recover his dog—
W J?° *?> P er haps, his only mate, his sole object of
affection on the lonely track, and more, perhaps
his only means of earning an honest crust; for a
man without a dog is seldom employed by men in
charge of travelling-stock.— 6xB. [The- Bulle-
tin does not think quite so meanly of the police.]

Dear Bulletin, — In your “Answers to
Correspondents, of a recent issue, you make some
remarks about the impossibility of independence
m running a country paper, and I want to make
some statements in rebuttal. It is possible to be
independent in any country town, but it is not pos-
sible to be successful—and it is possible to be
slavish and orawlsome in some country towns and
not be successful either. I have been both, and I
ought to know. My independence was always
genuine, but my alleged subscribers may have
seen that my crawlsorneness was a fraud. At
any rate, I wasn’t successful either way. During a
fit of temporary insanity I started a paper at a
goat hamlet in Gippsland, near Wilson’s Pro-
montory. I began with a circulation of 250, and
a free-list of 22. At the end of six months I
found I had really had a free-list of 278, and not
one subscriber. I also found that most of the
advertisers were on the free-list, also, and those
who were ready to liquidate my claims insisted, if
they were storekeepers, that I should take it out in
shoddy clothes and tinned fish, and, if publicans,
in the usual press manner. I have seen beauti-
fully iridescent macaws eating rainbow - snakes
for quite two days after collecting an account of
this kind. The hamlet and the public goat (which
was evidently the raison d’etre for settlement, as
the nannies seemed to come along first and be
merely followed by their owners) were owned by
one man. He could stand on a cleared bill above
the town, and all round as far as he could see the
dirt was his. lam not sure Whether he hadn’t
the fee simple of the atmosphere as well. Well,
I never mentioned him in my rag except to point
him as a moral for a sermon on land-nationalisa-
tion, and yet first time I wanted money he lent
me all I asked for. The money I borrowed from
him and repaid was about the only local coin re-
ceived during my six months’ ownership of the
paper. Ihe church would send in an order for
printing and advertising some tea-fight, and when
I mildly asked for payment a month after the
parson said that the Lord was a dead head, or
words to that effect. And it rained. Great
Scott ! how it rained. For nine months of the
year the place was ankle-deep in mud, and in
coming away from the alb-ged newspaper office on
publishing nights I used to fall over kangaroos
I and stumps and other features of the primeval
I bush. The full force of the Southern ocean would
curl over the promontory and strike the hamlet
right in the teeth, and keep on striking it for about
three weeks on end. In the summer the place
was full of snakes, and you couldn’t safely drink
anything but soda and lime-juice. The next-door
neighbor was a bootmaker and an advertiser, and
I didn’t like to object when his sticky infants
removed 51bs. of brevier quads so as they could
be amused by the quads melting in the fire. There
was also a loose-mouthed person who spent his
life in stretching cows’ udders and carting the
product to the railway, and his name sounded
like an indecent offence. This person used to put
some of his mouth into the office and say, “That’s
fine po’try yah put in thish yer paper. Did yer
write it outer your ’ead?” Furthermore, one of
my apprentices was the son of a local tin god
who had darkly hinted at paying me a premium
shortly. His son was the worst sort of a self-
soddened jay, but I thought of the premium and
bore it patiently. He used to shoot native bears
who must have been more than usually idiotic,
as they never attempted to chase him, and he
would skin the stinking things on my table and
nail the hides out to dry on the floor, so that the
unthinking visitor caught his large native feet in
the tacks and fell flop on the grease and blood-
stains. No premium eventuated, only three or
four people paid their accounts, and I was
frozen out, and a Scotch person took it over. I
would have starved but for Government advts.
—the indirect provincial press subsidy which
keeps alive many of the small country strugglers
in Australian journalism. A country newspaper
is an idyllic life for any nice, quiet grandfather
who objects to noise, but I have never been able
to calmly contemplate provincial journalism since
an advertising ironmonger offered to settle his bill
in rat-traps.—Randolph the Reckless.

SATURDAY, MARCH 30, 1895.
A Word to the Judges.
The banditti of the Pyrenees are said to
prey upon the traveller by hereditary right.
Immemorial prescription calls the sons of
every family to be professors of the gentle
art of snatching purses ; and it is not uncom-
mon to see three generations of brigands
together plundering one’s baggage with the
greatest unanimity. The father takes your
coat; the son your breeches; and thegay grand-
sire courteously demands the senor s shirt.
When at last you stand naked and shivering,
you have the consolation of knowing that, at
all events, the booty has been kept in the
family, and that no interloping stranger is a
peseta richer for your loss. The victim of
Australian lawyers is likely to have precisely
the same consolation. In some provinces the
disentanglement of law, the dispensation of
justice, are rapidly becoming a mere family
affair. If, in a spasm of anger or folly, a
man crosses a solicitor’s threshold, and after-
wards takes his case to Court, he very likely
notices that the barrister feed on his behalf
possesses the same characteristic lineaments
as the attorney who took his statement and
his guineas. Beneath the bench he sees
those lineaments budding on the face of
adolescence. Perplexed, he glances at the
Judge who is to decide the cause, and there
again are the family traits, accentuated by
the passage of many years. He wins his
suit. “Ah,” says an acquaintance, “you
employed Cheek and Jowl : you were
wise.” But the loser, who employed
Brow and Beak? Well, he knows,
like the Pyreneean traveller, that his
money has gone to support none of your
new-fangled harpies, but an ancient and re-
spectable family. Besides, Brow and Beak
were off their midden. See them in
Inequity, where Beak, senior, presides !
# * *
This monopoly of the practice and profits
of law by a few fortunate families is a grave
scandal and a growing danger to the Austra-
lian administration of justice. The number
of seats at the Feast of Clients is strictly
limited, and, bit by bit, the hungry ones who
have not the wedding-garment of kinship
with a Judge are being pushed to the door.
The Judge is invariably the root of the evil.
Under the shield of his authority the
members of his family stand back to back,
acting as one man for aggression or defence.
Against their united influence an outsider
usually fights in vain. If a clever man
resists, he may be brought into the charmed
circle by the power of the distaff, to become
a fresh source of strength and to create a
fresh weakness in the side of opponents.
Should he refuse alliance, war may be
declared, and nine times in ten the clever
man succumbs to odds and goes under. If
he prove too strong, the weight of the Judge
is in reserve to be consciously or uncon-
sciously thrown into the scale, and the issue
of the struggle is sure.
• # «
The risk and loss which the public incur
under such circumstances are sufficiently
obvious. With confidence in the direction of
justice once lost (even by the most brutal and
ignorant) the virtue is gone out of any com-
munity. Already there is uneasiness, doubt,
suspicion. Whether that suspicion is well
or ill-founded does not in the least affect the
question : it exists, and should be removed
in the only way possible, by removing its
cause. “ What !” say the friends and rela-
tives of the Judges concerned, “do you
accuse our father, our brother, our uncle,
our father-in-law, our patron, of bias 1”
The Bulletin does not, although it believes
that no man can conduct cases or give judg-
ments in which the success or welfare of
members of his family is intimately con-
cerned, without being consciously or uncon-
sciously biased. But the point is that,
whether the bias exists or not, the public
and a large section of the legal profession
believe it to exist, and the effect is to destroy
that faith in the purity of justice which is
indispensable to its satisfactory administra-
tion. For example, The Bulletin would
never say that any Australian Judge is impro-
perly influenced when his son or his son-in-law
or his nephew pleads before him. But a suitor
who recently lost his case before a Judge
whose relative was opposing counsel, signifi-
cantly remarked that “he did not believe
there was a man alive who could fight a
Judge and a Judge’s relative at one and the
same time.” The Judge, of course, knows
(and The Bulletin knows) that he decided
the case upon its merits and according to the
evidence, and that there was no relative in
court for him ; but evidently the suitor dis-
agrees. That the suitor should have a
specious pretext for disagreeing is a public
calamity.
• # *
And the worst of it is that, in such cases,
so many suitors disagree. Many people,
for example, believed that the surpris-
ing practice formerly enjoyed by the son
of an Australian ex-judge in his father’s
court was due chiefly to the relationship of
the parties. The Judge and his son (and
The Bulletin) were aware, of course, that
this was an error ; but, nevertheless, Parlia-
ment was supplied with a return which
showed that, in cases heard before his father,
the son, though a comparatively junior bar-
rister, held far more briefs than the oldest and
ablest other counsel practising. It is notice-
able, also, that while those of this ex-Judge’s
sons who started business when their father
was firmly planted on the Bench, are
reputed to have done extremely well; those
other who started shortly previous to his
retirement are reputed to have done—not so
well. And the foolish public—wrongly, of
course —persists in drawing inferences from
these things.
* # *
Unluckily, the public never will refrain
from drawing inferences. When, some time
ago, in an Australian Supreme Court case,
the Judge who opened the sittings was
unable to proceed, and his place was taken
by another Judge ; a near relative of this
second Judge, who had not previously been
briefed in an important case listed, was
immediately given a brief for one of the
parties, and some low-minded people con-
cerned in the case immediately began to
draw inferences. The Judge and his relative
(and The Bulletin) know, of course, that
the inferences are quite unfounded ; but
the mouth of the Judge is shut, and his
relative has little opportunity of con-
vincing the pig-headed public of its error.
So that, apparently, there are only four
ways of stopping these inferences, which are
calculated so seriously to prejudice the ad-
ministration of justice. The first is to pro-
vide that Judges shall have no relatives what-
ever. This would be difficult. A way might
be found of ensuring that Judges, like priests,
should never marry, or that if they did
marry they should have no children ; but this
would not protect the country from brothers,
or from nephews, or from the persons who
would lay siege to the affections of the Judge’s
maiden aunts, witli the base motive of be-
coming his relation by marriage. Besides,
to find a Judge absolutely without kith or
kin is impossible, unless a new race of law-
yers could be specially hatched from eggs
made of Blackstone and protoplasm, without
the intervention of father and mother.
Therefore, this way does not seem feasible.
* • *
Nor does the suggestion that Judges should
have enough relations to supply all the
demands of both parties bear close inspec-
tion. At first blush there is fascination in
the idea that every Judge should have two
sons practising before him, or four, or six, or
sixteen. If he went as high as twenty-two
(and some Australian Judges have not been
unworthy to stand before Beranger’s ‘ 1 bon
petit roi,” who had a hundred good reasons
to be called the father of his people), then
suitors could pick a team of eleven barristers
a-side, tossing for first pick, and have the
old man as umpire. When a Judge has only
one son, as sometimes happens at present,
the side which snaps up that son often con-
siders that it has an advantage. Fora Judge
is not a calculating-machine running without
friction, and producing definite results from
given factors. He is a human being, with
human appetites, habits, whims and pre-
judices, moved by human motives, liable to
human ailments. Consider how dexterously
a clever son, a nephew, or son-in-law may
manage him to gain his client’s ends ! And
the relative is the only man who has an authen-
tic clue to his Honor’s character. Other
advocates are like musicians set before a
piano where all the keys are jumbled, fo
that a key which, by position, should sound
C, actually sounds G, and G sounds E, while
E sounds a note two octaves higher. But
the son (say) has practised on the piano
since infancy, and can make it play any tune
he wishes. He knows his father’s good days
and bad days ; he knows when he has been
ill, how ill he has been, and how far it is
safe to contradict him. He gauges accurately
by his parent’s countenance how his dinner
is digesting, and if his liver is all right. He
knows the meaning of every twitch of the
Judge’s eyebrows, of every movement of his
body ; and drops or presses his argument
accordingly. Perhaps he still lives in his
father’s house ; anyhow, he has lived with
him till manhood, has most likely been his
associate, and knows his views exactly upon
(at least some) doubtful points of law. What
a tremendous handicap does this son take
into the race !
» * •
A third way out of the difficulty would be
to invite the Judges not to make lawyers of
their sons ; but this way also is hopeless,
for the answer to the invitation is generally
“No” in advance (though one highly-placed
Australian Judge has set a good example
by making his heir an engineer. As a
rule, every Judge makes lawyers of his
sons—just as his father the Judge made a
lawyer of him—from sheer force of habit,
and because he cannot conceive a son of his
being anything but a lawyer. Thus it is
that in some Australian provinces the legal
descendants of certain old-time Judges are
almost too numerous to count; while other
Judges have one, two, or three sons or other
relatives practising before them at the Bar.
In one province, an ex-Judge’s four or five
sons are all either solicitors or barristers,
while other Judges have sons growing
up to practise under papa’s wing in the
usual course. In several provinces the
Judge’s associate is just as inevitably his
son whenever it can be managed. So
that to expect the ruck of Judges to
make engineers, or doctors, or publicans
of cheir sons is to expect the impossible.
There remains only one thing to be done :
let the Judges of every Australian province
petition Parliament to pass a short Act to
prevent their near relatives by blood or
marriage from practising before them. This
would at once remove suspicion from the
minds of the public, establish a better feel-
ing among members of the legal profession,
spare the" Judges many annoying miscon-
structions, and markedly facilitate the ad-
ministration of justice.
Federation.
Give me at once good, wholesome-hearted
federation :
I believe in it, work for it, long for it—
A nation of true people proud and complete in
their own throbbing isle.
Not a dead image, a cold, empty sepulchre,
A mere compend of current hypocrisies and
conventionalities,
To be founded by folly, legalised by force.
Not a storehouse of newspaper fads, and string-
pulling politicians’ puerilities:
Something with heart and blood and brain at
the back of it.
Warm with the whole-souled concurrence of
the people ;
Void of the jealousies of cities and Parliaments,
Of the petty quibbles of rival functionaries,
Plot and intrigue, and sordid calculation.
Something a little more than ceremonial,
Above mean manoeuvres, narrowness, shallow-
ness,
The parochialism of miserly land-owners.
A tower to bear all the blasts of the centuries,
A voice to trumpet truth over every land and
sea of this shining globe,
A torch eternally beaconing humanity onward.
If not this, then not anything ;
I will have no compromise, no subterfuge, no
sweet opiate,
Better carelessness, silence, uncomprehending
apathy.
J.C.M.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Not an Imperial Fad Oration.
Col. Bull, U.S.A. Consul-General of Australia,
addressed the Imperial Federation League in
Melb. Town Hall, the other day, with very
little satisfaction to the League, if the de-
meanour of the platform figureheads may be
taken as a guide. From start to finish the
Colonel preached Socialism, and the blank
dismay on the platform was a joyful sight.
Melbourne has a host of people of the Zox and
Downes Carter type who pose publicly at
every opportunity. Lately they have had
bad times. At the Australian Federation
meeting, Kingston preached one-man-one-vote.
At the big bi-metallic meeting, Morton
Frewen preached Protection, and before this
Jingo meeting Colonel Bell preached Socialism.
The Colonel likewise preached Freetrade. But
it was a Freetrade so ameliorated by Socialism
as to be utterly abhorrent to the Cobber
school. The Colonel contrasted the magnificence
of millionaires with the poverty of the people
—the increasing wealth of monopolies with the
little advantage accruing to the mass of the
community from invention and industrial pro-
gress. For 100 minutes the eloquence lasted,
with a wealth of rhetoric and gesticulation. The
result was paradoxical. The Tories heard an
advocacy of Freetrade that horrified them. The
Radicals found themselves admiring an impos-
sible combination of Freetrade and Socialism.
When the orator launched into extravagant
praises of England’s might, the jingoes enthused
tremendously, and when he declared that it was
all as nothing if the United States did not back
it up, they enthused still more. That bellige-
rent, Freetrade England, with her forts in
every sea, should be nothing without the Pro-
tectionist, unarmed States, was a hard pill to
swallow —yet down it went. But the loudest
cheer of all came full-throated from every
man in the hall when Col. Bell demanded
that Australia should take her place among the
nations. It would be hard to call an ideal, so
eloquently outlined, a bagman’s millennium.
To make trade the end and all of man’s life is
the Freetrader’s aim, but not Col. Bell’s. He
proposes to have Freetrade with the competi-
tive system eliminated, so that the vested
rights of labor shall get recognition, and paten-
tees and land-monopolists shall no longer ex-
ploit the earnings of the community. This is
not Freetrade—lt is an impossible form of Pro-
tection. The Bulletin will stick to its own
practicable policy.
Knapp, the Governor-Maker.
Blue Ribbon Knapp, the persistent Sydney
letter-writing bore, who, as a publicist, is an
equal mixture of the fierce Italian greyhound
and the carnivorous pink-eyed rabbit, suggests
that Chief Justice Barley be appointed (Gover-
nor of New South Wales. Poor Chief Justice
Darlby ! Knominated by Knapp ! In advo-
cating the appointment, Knapp eloquently
remarks that it would “seal the tender tie, the
crimson thread, which binds Australia to the
mother land.” Of course, the bathetic Knapp’s
suggestion is mischievous balderdash and
mere self-advertising froth, since there is
not the least probability of the Crown taking
the hint. Apart from that, the idea, as
John Ballance pointed out, is bad demo-
cratic diplomacy. While the Crown retains
the right of nomination, it is belter that
foreigners should be nominated for Australian
Governorships, and the foreign character of the
office kept thus well in view of the people. We
only want local men as Crown representatives
when the choice rests entirely with our-
selves—that is to say, never ; since when
the Australian provinces elect their own presi-
dents or vice-presidents, the Crown will be
represented no longer. All that is worth con-
tending for, until the present system gives way
to a better, is the right of Australian veto upon
the appointment of too objectionable foreigners.
It is a moot point, to be sure,-whether it would
not be desirable to get as Governor the most
objectionable foreigner possible —even a para-
sitic Battenberg —in order that popular disgust
with the foreign connection might become still
more thorough. But while bheCrown nominates,
unless the right of veto is definitely conceded to
Parliament, the local man is the last man wanted.
For whom would the Crown choose? Simply
the Fattest, the most undemocratic, the most
truckling, grovelling personage it could find.
The man of all others whom the people disliked
most cordially, the man most loyal to the
Crown, most disloyal to Australia, would un-
doubtedly be nominated. And then, when
Democracy turned against him, it wmuld be met
with the reply : “ But he is a local man ; he is
one of yourselves !” and his office would gain
under this cloak of locality a representative
character which it can never have at present.
Elect our own Governor —good ! Accept an
Australian citizen as Governor at England s
mere nomination —No !

The Boodleland Squatters.
Dear Bulletin, —Re par. of Feb. 16 on decline
of West Queensland towns. The cause is simply
the manner in which the country is governed for
the benefit of the big squatter, while the small
grazier is not allowed a footing at any price.
Take Aramac for example. We have some
of the finest grazing country in Australia, and
can also obtain artesian water in any quantity
at from 700 to 1400 ft. The district is possibly
the most suitable in Queensland for division
into grazing selections, each not less than 5000
acres; but it is at present occupied by half a
dozen large stations —this fact alone, with its
attendant curse of absenteeism, being the cause
cf the stagnation round Aramac. The only graz-
ing selections thrown open here have been
rushed, and are paying handsomely ; and if
there were 100 thrown open to-morrow, 20,000
acres in extent, there are people in the im-
mediate neighborhood eager to take them up,
without speaking of the dozens continually
coming from the South. Recently Govt, threw
open a number of selections some 150 miles away
—not comparable in value with wdiat you could
get round here. Enquiries for them came even
from South Australia, Victoria, and New South
Wales ; yet at the same time Ministers profess
that the country is in great straits financially,
though they are accepting a fraction of Id. rent
per sq. mile where they might be receiving U
or 2d. per acre. For some inscrutable reason
the selections referred to have now been with-
drawn—why I can’t say, but it was certainly
not for want of selectors for those areas large
enough to keep a man and his family. Some
of the areas thrown open were so small that they


were useless for settlement. As you know, there
are other ways ofkilling a cat than choking it
with cream. What Aramac wants is selection,
and this, unluckily, is what Govt, does its best
to prevent. A police reserve of 1000. acres was
made here, hounded on one side by the Aramac
reserve and on the opposite side by a small
selection of 1280 acres. Sometime ago the
police reserve was found to he unsuitable, and,
upon application being made, was thrown open
at a rental of 2s. per acre ! The adjacent selec-
tion, similar in every respect except size, is
rented at 3d. per acre, and the occupant is
barely able to support his family. The absur-
dity of the 2s. rent has been pointed out, hut
without result. This will give you some idea
why Western Queensland doesn’t go ahead. Pro-
gress is throttled by the vast squattages, with
Govt, conniving.—Yours, Equity, Aramac.
The Coming" Figurehead.
Pending alteration of the provincial constitu-
tions, Australian Governors must be paid ; hut
there is no necessity to pay them extrava-
gantly. Iti the past the extravagance has been
beyond question. Some Governors have drawn
in cash and perquisites not less than £15,000 a
year—an amount quite out of proportion to the
merit of the recipient, to the value of the ser-
vice, to the character of the office, to the popu-
lation and resources of the province which paid
it. When the President of the United States
is adequately paid at £lO,OOO a year, the
Governor of an Australian province may very
well do with £5OOO. That is the amount
received by the Governors of Queensland, of
South Australia, and of Maoriland ; and it is
quite enough for the Governors of New South
Wales and Victoria. Victoria has lately with-
drawn from the insane rivalry with the older
province, and the imminent Brassey is
to get £7OOO a year with house—and
no pickings. The figure would probably
have been £5OOO, as fixed by the Assembly,
hut for complications alleged to have arisen
through the previous offer of the larger sum.
New South Wales can easily avoid complica-
tions by fixing at once at £5OOO the salary
to be. paid to Gov. Duff’s successor. No
man will earn more : it is all but a certainty
that the man who comes will earn very much
less. The dignity of the office need not be
taken into consideration. If the Imperial
authorities wish their nominee to maintain the
dignity which naturally hedges the representa-
tive of a Royal family averaging sft. high arid
3ft. thick or thereabouts, the Imperial authori-
ties should find the cash. The people of N.S.
Wales are not concerned with Royalty’s alleged
dignity or absence of dignity, and the new
Governor can keep his representative capacity
in the coal-scuttle for all the Australian people
cares. Nor is it desired or desirable that a
Governor should he furnished with a cash
surplus for the entertainment of “ society ”
toadies. Anyway, the men and women who
crawl round the doors of Government House
will not be discouraged by the absence of
food and drink, should a retrenched viee-gerent
find it necessary to stop the issue of sand-,
wiches and bad whisky taken free out of
bond. Merely to bask in the reflected light of
Her G racious is all that they require. They
erawl by instinct—not for their suppers. And
New South Wales, and every other pro-
vince in Australia, can find much better
uses for the people’s money than to devote
it to the swilling and" guzzling of metro-
politan silvertaiK especially when thou-
sands iu the metropolis and thousands “ out-
back ” do not know to-day where to-mor-
row.’s tucker is coming from. The reduction
might very well go beyond £5009, ..but £5OOO
will do for the present. It goes one better than
Victoria, which may stimulate province-
to cut Brassey’s successor down to £4OOO,
in which case there is nothing to prevent New
South Wales offering £3OOO. That is a sane
kind of rivalry which The Bulletin would
be glad to see. But, in the present, for New
South Wales, £5OO0 —and no perks. Let the
Labor-party strain their souls for that. The
house and the £5OOO, but not one penny beyond,
on whatever ingenious pretext demanded. Perks
are the ruin of straight finance, the abhorrence
of every properly-eonstituted democrat. Better
£lO,OOO right out than £5OOO and ever-expand-
ing perks. The Governor’s man-servant and
his maid-servant, his secretaries and officials,
his carriages and horses and forage—let him
pay for all out of his own pocket, and console
himself, as a sensible Governor will, with the
thought that a Governor’s liquors and cigars
are duty-free (for which there is no good reason
whatever). With whisky at half-a-crown a
.gallon and tobacco at a shilling a pound, the
Governor who can’t console himself isn’t worth
consoling.
The Passing of Hopetoun.
Lord Hopetoun is the Melbourne topic of the
week. Lord Hopetoun, after being banqueted
and farewelled and officially worshipped in a
lavish manner, has quitted the scene of his vice-
regal labors (unless something went wrong with
his'travelling arrangements) to the accompani-
ment of cannons’ roar. The local army lined the
streets, the local Fat Man waved Ids influential
head-gear, and the local populace did not spoil
their Governor’s exit by laughing at its exagge-
rated importance. Among the large and grow-
ing majority of thinking persons who object to
any sort of monarchial representation for social
reasons, and who honestly believe that a
Governor imported solely on account of his
birthright position is an undesirable resi-
dent—among the anti-loyalists, in short
Lord Hopetoun was ' kindly thought of,
when thought about at all. He walked
through the colorless character of Gover-
nor with a springy step and a propitiatory
smile. Appearing younger than his age, the
slim earl prudently resolved to be even younger
than his appearance, and pleaded to the com-
munity, by word and manner, for special con-
sideration on account of his inexperience, if;
presented himself as a light-hearted n >\ .oc
sojourning in Victoria for the benefit of his
In-alth, and feeling grateful to the climate that
suited his delicate constitution. Hence Lord
Hopetoun’s negative popularity with tax-
payers in general. He was a refreshing change
from the old vice-regal stamp of person who
assumes that his exalted presence is laying the
country under an obligation to him. Australians,
all over the continent, take credit to themselves
for Australian sunshine. We speak of the
weather with patriotic pride. Consequently,
Gov. Hopetoun’s frequent acknowledgments of
favors received from the atmosphere commended
the weak-chested peer to his fellow breathers,
and they were sorry to witness the departure of
one who regretted having to go ’Ome to study
his rent-roll. The spectacle was almost pathetic.
A pallid “-boy-Governor ” tearing himself away
from the sanatorium where he had been feeling
quite strong and well, bai jove ! for the past
few years. Sickly globe-trotters come and
go without exciting the least public in-
terest, hut Gov. Hopetoun was the clean-
shaven Gov. who cost them more than
£20,000 a year to entertain, and they cheered
him accordingly. A less objectionable Governor
Victoria had never known. Famous for nothing
save a fainting fit at his first levee, he left with
flying colors. When we come to remember
that Lord Hopetoun carried a handsome but
unsociable wife on his shoulders, so to speak,
and yet managed to get through the vice-regal
job without a hitch, we are struck by the idea
that a lame young Governor, embellished with
a fine, hacking cough and a respirator, would
tighten the silken bonds considerably.
The reciprocity-treaty which is being nego-
tiated between South Australia and Maoriland
promises to be an awkward stumbling-block in
the road of Federation. In its present form
the agreement provides for the free admission
of S.A. wines and a few other articles into
Maoriland in return for the free admission into
S.A. of Maoriland oats, &c. This arrangement
is to endure for seven years, and while it lasts
each contracting party is absolutely prohibited
from entering into any commercial treaty what-
ever with any other province of Australasia.
If Maoriland joins the Federation—supposing it
to come along within the seven years—the
treaty makes no difference, for Federation will
abolish all interprovincial tariffs and allow for
free interchange of everything within the limits
of the Commonwealth. But Maoriland has
definitely announced her intention of standing
out and playing a lone hand. Therefore, when
the Federal Parliament undertakes to establish
a uniform Australian tariff against the outside
world it will be compelled to make an excep-
tion in favor of Adelaide so far as the
Maoriland goods covered by the treaty are
concerned. And as there will be no border
Customs-houses, the Maoriland goods which
came in free at Adelaide can also get access to
the other provinces, so that there will be a large
hole in the Federal tariff. It is not likely that
the trade between the two provinces will
amount to much, but the negotiation of a treaty
with such provisoes means that, for seven years
to come, S.A. will make the establishment of a
simple and uniform Australian tariff impossible,
and will do it for the smallest imaginable in-
ducement. The willingness of the Kingston
Government,' for such a very questionable
make Federation a little more diffi-
cult tllan it already is, doesn’t augur well for
the future. A few more treaties of the same
kind'would make Federation impossible for
years to come.

~Dear Bulletin,— That contest between Man-
chester cotton and India is by no means new.
Here is an extract from Carey : “ Cotton
abounded, and half-a-century since (1807)
, native labor not only supplied the Home
demand but produced a hundred millions of
pounds of cloth per annum for export to dis-
tant countries. Exchange was so much in
favor of India that a rupee now (1857) worth
44 cents was then worth no less than 64 cents.
The company had a monopoly of collecting
taxes, but, in return, it preserved to the people
the control of their domestic market. Such
protection was required, because while Eng-
land prohibited the export of a single collier
who might instruct the people in mining coal,
of a steam-engine or the mechanic who might
make one, of a powerloom, or of the artisan
who could give to the poor Hindoo instruction
iu the use of such machines, she, at the same
time, imposed heavy duties on the produce of
Indian looms received in Britain. Later, how-
ever, the trade to India was thrown open, the
restrictions on the export of machinery and
artisans being still maintained in full force, and
thus a poor and ignorant people were exposed
to competition with a community possessed of
far more effective implements. Twenty years
later, we find a whole year to have passed
without the export of a single piece of cloth.”
-Y.
Melbourne Metropolitan Board of Works has
at last carried an abstract resolution in favor of
the minimum wage. Discussing the matter, the
Argus describes the speech of Commissioner
Talbot as “the most notable made on the
question.” This brilliant person’s oration is
summarised as follows :
There are a large number of laboring men in Brunswick
who are fathers of families and ratepayers and have been
out of work for 12 months. These men, who are middle-
aged, would he glad to get work at small wages, hut if a
minimum rate is fixed above the ruling market rate they
will get none at all.
As the minimum wage is 65., it would be in-
teresting to know what Talbot and the Argus
quote as “ the ruling market rate ” for “ labor-
ing men in Brunswick who are fathers of
families.” It is about time the Argus began to
give labor-market quotations in its commercial
column something after this style ;
Labor. —The local market in labor is steady at from
2s. 6d. to 3s. 5d., supplies offering liberally. A fair busi-
ness was done at 2s. 9d., and one lot of pick-and-shoyel
hands, slightly damaged, went at 2s. 3|d. Inferior
laborers have been quoted as low as 2s. 2d. For prime
samples, young and sound, 3s. was offered, and taken in
several places. The medium and off qualities were avail-
able from Is. 9d. and upwards. The market promises to
be easy through the week and buyers are cautious.
According to the decision of the Vic. Cabinet
last week in the cases of two individuals under
“sentence of death recorded” for the commis-
sion of offences of imbecile obscenity, JO lashes
are equivalent to five years’ imprisonment. One
miserable wretch, who had been unfortunate
enough to “ pass the doctor,” was sen-
tenced to 10 years and two floggings
t ■
of 15 lashes each : the other, the
Cabinet had beep “informed,” was of “weak
intellect,” and got 15 years. By the natural
operation of these penalties the alleged healthy-
minded committor of an unclean act will —
supposing he is, as implied, a brute to begin
with—come out of prison a worse and more
degraded brute than ever ; while the imbecile
will become more pronouncedly weak-minded
and fit for the lunatic asylum, to which he
should have been committed iu the first in-
stance. The sentences imposed by the Judges
are often illogical enough, and it would appear
that sentence by Cabinet is just as had.
Land-alienation brings other curses in its
train. In New South Wales there is a demand
for postponement of selectors’ arrears till the
next generation. In Victoria, also, the selectors
have fallen into arrears with their payments, and
an agonised wail goes up from among them when
the Treasury demands its dues. The mort-
gagees join in the wail, and the Tory press,
and all the noble army of croakers—and a nice
time the Minister of Lands has with them all.
The Minister asks for money and the selectors
ask for time—as time and money are both
unemployed in Victoria now they ought
to get it, but they don’t. The evil is
accentuated by the immoral Australian custom
of paying proceeds of land-sales into revenue,
instead of into a sinking-fund. But the root of
the evil is the land-alienation. The selectors’
payments should be pure rent, not alleged pro-
gress-payments on an alleged capital value. The
selectors should be tenants pure and simple,
and their rent should be fixed from year to
year iu accordance with the actual value of the
property they rent. As for the mortgagees
who have advanced moneys at excessive rates
on the poor security a selector in arrears could
give—they can stand the loss which their rates
of interest proves them to have expected.
Bowen (Q.) State-railway is one of the natural
curiosities of Australian political railway sys-
tems. It meanders into the vast interior for 50
miles, and abruptly deposits you in the middle
of a forest. Nobody lives in the forest, or has
ever lived there, and uobody ever wants to go
there, and no goods can he taken there, because
there is no one to take them to ; so two trains
run out to the forest every week with the
engine-driver and fireman and guard and station-
master, just to see if the forest is growing in
the same place, and when it is found all right
the trains just come hack again. This enables
the Bowen people to talk of “our railway,”and
gives the local editor (who is about the weariest
man in Australia, and very sick with hope
deferred) a chance to dilate upon the “ magni-
ficent future ” in store for Bowen when the line
is extended to the Reid river, 40 miles from the
present forest terminus. The line was origin-
ally meant to be extended to the Reid river,
but jealous Townsville influence managed to
block the extension at the outset, and it has
merely been “going to be extended” ever since.
The inhabitants who witnessed the turning of
the first sod are getting gray anti toothless now,
hut they die off cheerfully in the hope of a
blessed resurrection in time to see “the exten-
sion.”
The people of Melbourne are considering the
advisability of establishing a free port —Wil-
liams to wu will probably he the place selected—
and if this valuable idea is not smothered by
the hideous slowness and inefficiency of Parlia-
mentary procedure it will probably be carried
out —some day. Even a simple and obviously
useful idea, however, to which uobody has any
serious objection, is so apt to come to grief on
the shoreless sea of Legislative formality that
no one can even guess when the proposed
event is likely to happen. The scheme itself is
one which can he explained in a few words.
Melbourne does a large distributing trade,
goods being landed there from over-sea, to he
re-shipped to other provinces. The State col-
lects duty on these goods, which involves a
good deal of trouble and stationery, and a lot of
money temporarily out of pocket; and when they
are re-shipped it bauds back the duty as “draw-
back.” This involves more time and trouble and
stationery. Also, the processes cost some small
amount in fees. The importer loses the
fees and the time and the interest on the money
paid as duty, and the State loses time also, and
wear and tear of officials and stationery, and
gains nothing whatsoever. The establishment
of a free port is intended to obviate all this.
At such a port all goods will be landed at the
lowest possible wharfage and other charges, and
they will be stored without paying any duty or
going through any needless formalities. If
they leave the store to be used or sold iu Vic-
toria, then duty will be charged ; if they leave
it to be re-shipped they will go out free as they
came in. If Victoria establishes a free port,
and the other provinces don’t follow suit, then
Melbourne will become the distributing centre
for Australia, and will annex whatever profit
there may he in the trade. The idea is so
simple, and the saving of time and worry and
stationery and money ,so obvious, that it is
strange no one ever thought of it before, and
still stranger, now that somebody has thought
of it, that it will probably take five or six
years for anything to be done in the matter.
According to St. James’s Gazette, much dis-
satisfaction is expressed in “ the higher walks
of theatrical life ” at the rule which prevents
actors and actresses being received at Court. It
doesn’t say much for the souls of mummers in
higher walks. No true artist ever hankered
after the cheap and empty social distinction
conferred by newspaper reports. The glory of
a presentation at Court begins and ends in
press mention of that solemnly ridiculous cir-
cumstance. The Queen receives only “ gentle-
folks.” She limits her circle of formal acquaint-
ance, even as an ordinary vulgar snob is careful
not to become friendly with persons of seedy
appearance. If you manufacture beer or had
spirits for the destruction of the human race
you may get yourself into the royal outer circle
and your name into the Court Journal. As
for the rule relating to these grovelling actors, it
applies to about 99 19-20 per cent, of Her
Majesty’s loyal subjects in Great Britain. The
crowd of unrecognised toilers who cannot enter

The London Times says : “ Speaking at a
meeting of the Council of the Liverpool Cham-
ber of Commerce, last week, Mr. Bindloss
made rather startling reference to the diversion
of British iron and steel trades to other
countries. Liverpool, he said, had benefited
largely from exports to the U.S. in the past,
but of late years the States had developed their
own resources, and by heavy tariffs had so
stimulated production that they could not only
supply themselves, but severely interfered
with England in foreign markets, and be
would not be surprised if they by-and by
threatened competition even in this country. A
Pennsylvania company had lately received from
the Russian Government an order for 12,000
tons of armor-plates, work hitherto given to
Sheffield. This meant a difference of £500,000
or £600,000 to that town. Our trade with Italy
was also being threatened, and, last of all,
Canada, which had cost more in blood and
treasure than all the other colonies, had imposed
a most severe tariff, which practically meant
the annihilation of our trade with that country.
We had also to face an intense German com-
petition with India, and, indeed, with all parts
of the world.”
Dear Bulletin,—A cricket cablegram : “ The
Times says the Australians accepted their
defeat with true English generosity.” Can
anybody supply a belter example of smug, self-
satisfied egotism ? Who hut the insular Briton
would make himself a standard of measure-
ment for the virtues of the rest of the
world ? Does “ English generosity ” differ
from the article in use among the lower races
of mankind? From French generosity, say? or
from generosity made in Germany ? Hospitality
is the better half of generosity. In Australia
and Maoriland the British globe-trotter meets
with a hospitality that surprises him. The
surprise is significant. Up-country stations
welcome him, a perfect stranger, with a
lavish warmth which he himself would
hardly bestow on a life-long friend. The
household sacrifices everything to provide him
amusement; riding, hunting, shooting —he
has only to breathe his whim. What
Australasian hospitality may be like is shown
by the adventure of an English lady who
told the writer that, while travelling on one of
the rivers of Northern Maoriland, she called in
at a settler’s homestead" for a glass of water;
and, though an entire stranger, remained a
guest in the family for nsix weeks. Imagine
such a scene occurring in England. The warm-
blooded “colonial” stepping as a matter of
course from his punt; the cold, superior stare of
the footman as he directs him to the servants’
entrance ; or the red and wrathful rudeness of
the proprietor of the mansion instructing him
in the law of trespass, and commending him to
the waters of the river ! “ English generosity ”
is a figment, a tradition ! It has taken flight
beyond seas, along with many other stalwart
virtues which have found themselves cramped
by the commercial slavery of the last half-
century. The Englishman of to-day lives on
the credit accumulated by his ancestors : he is
swollen by conceit beyond all tolerance. Some-
body will stick a bayonet into him one of these
days, and the gas will escape in a liurrv

At Strathalhyn (S.A.) the monotony of the
last monthly sale was changed to excitement when
a very prominent old resident was seen, whip in
hand, chasing his son (a 40-year-old) around the
stockyards, the “young ’un” having failed to
comply with a parental demand. Unable to catch
his nimble offspring, the grey-haired dad went for
the son’s buggy, smashing up the wheels with an
axe. This did not suffice to cool the old man’s
anger, and sonny’s house was next visited, the
furniture having to suffer.
Five years ago, or thereabouts, a settler
near Wellington (M.L.) lost a horse. He reported
the fact to the police, and the animal was put on
the list of stolen property, and ever since then the,
authorities have looked for it at intervals, and
never came any nearer to finding it—until the
other day, when the animal suddenly dawned on
tiiem, in a manner of speaking. The thief had
doctored the brands a little, banged the animal’s
tail and out his mane, and had sold him to the
police department. Since then he has done many
a long day’s run while out looking for himself, and
has come back again without seeing any sign of
himself on the furthest horizon. How that horse
must have laughed !
Dear Bulletin, —lf N.S. W. Labor Bureau
doesn’t bang Banagher, then Banagher has never
been bung. There was no scarcity of labor
up country when—or since—the Bureau com-
menced operations. The labor sent from the
metropolis on passes has had the effect of lower
ing wages and supplanting employes. Most hush
workers out of employment now would have a
better chance of getting work through the Bureau
than by remaining in their habitat. The em-
ployer has a large faith in the chastening influence
of the city unemployed mill, and expects from the
imported article a cheap subservience he cannot
get from the man who was never minus mutton
to his damper. What a hubbub would there be
amongst the organised laborers of Sydney if a
few hundreds of unemployed hushmen got an
outfit and free passes to Sydney for the ostensible
purpose of fossicking for fish in “our beautiful
harbor ! ” Yet such a proceeding would be just
as sensible as sending “all sorts and conditions of
men ” to fossick for gold where Chinamen won’t
put a pick in. A return showing how many of
the “fossickers” are still fossicking, and how-
many have entered into the bush labor competi-
tion would be instructive. But the end is not
yet! The Labor Bureau as at present conducted
means the centralisation of the labor-market, with
the eventual result of making Sydney the depfit
for the unemployed of the whole province.—

My Dear Moorabinda—
The vice-regal demise has given a vast number
of aggressive nobodies a golden chance to get
their names into the papers which fatuously
chronicle such very small-beer, and apparently
don't know the sheep from the goats. Strange
people have been calling at Govt. House in
awkward squads, and writing their names down
in the vice-regal book, for all the world as if
the bereaved chatelaine intended giving a fare-
well party and they wanted to be in it.
Some of the visitors who forced their sympathy
on Lady Duff in the early stages of her bereave-
ment were highly indignant at not being allowed
an actual interview with the mourner. They
yearned to be a sister to her in the saddest
hour of her life, and wanted to hold her hand
and lend her their clean pocket-handkerchief —
also, they felt a strong desire to know how the
vice-regal mourning was cut. So, when they
wei ! politely blocked on the mat and told to
couhde their emotions to a blank page, they
: 1 most refused to do so. One pushing and well-
: dvertised lady did bounce off the premises.
There are two visitors’-books at Govmentouse
at present—one for the Lieut.-Governor and one for
Lady Duff, and I am sure it must be edifying
to see the tearful more or less society “lydies”
inscribing their sympathy in the latter, and then,
brightening up at the thought of possible junket-
ings, dodge over to set down their names
in the former with a view to being armed at all
points. In the midst of death we are very much
alive. Sorrow with the widow and the fatherless;
but don’t let your grief blind you to the fact that
there may be an acting-vice-regal garden-party or
two when the month of State mourning has passed.
I have been a good deal amused, by the way, at
the said State mourning. Attempts at it have occa-
sionally verged on the grotesque, particularly in
the case of a prominent lady in a loud dress with
a clumsy cloth badge and a sort of cook’s cap of
crape. Another damsel’s “ State mourning ” took
the form of a white dress, a green sash, and black
crape rosettes in the front of her gown and hat;
and a third, in a lizard-colored frock, was evi-
dently enjoying the effect of her deep badge and
crape flowers, for she was smiling from ear to ear.
These models were seen haphazard in the streets,
of course ; one section of society was much more
thorough in the inky-cloak business.
All who know anything of the black and bitter
past of N.S. Wales, including especially the days
oftheKiama Ghost, must deeply regret the so-
far-uncontradicted statement that a lady in a high
civic position has absolutely refused to patronise
a certain school festival promoted by people of a
different creed, and has set it down in black and
white that she cannot possibly have anything to
do with R.C, functions, X take it that in these com-
paratively happy and tolerant days official people
should have no religion, but should cheerfully
patronise a Moslem feast and be ready to finish
the night at a Presbyterian prayer-meeting. Un-
less the lady effectively denies the sentiment im-
puted to her there will be much trouble. No one
known in advance to be dominated by the senti-
ments attributed to her could ever be pub-
licly chosen for the position she now holds. There
can be no doubt as to the proper social status of any-
body who, in “ this alleged nineteenth century,”
quarrels about religion with a decently-behaved
neighbor.
I see that Acting-Governor Darley has arranged
his staff wherewith to run the province until some
confiding English peer whose estates need nursing
comes forth to release him from social bondage.
The popular Mr. Bayley Macarthur is to be pri-
vate secretary, vice Mr. Harry Darley—now, I
believe, at Coolgardie where the typhoid-stories
come from-—while the lemon-tinted Captain Feild-
ing takes the place of the plump and pleasing
Captain Horace Dangar, who is now cramming
military knowledge into himself with a ramrod at
’Ome.
I have received from the adaptor, Mr. F. R.
Peel, a rhythmic arrangement, in waltz-time, of
the übiquitous “ Sweet Marie ” song made popular
by Mr. Norrie. Mr. Peel has dished up a very
swinging waltz, easy to play and pretty all
through, and people who play “extras” should
add it to their repertoires at onoe.
From Mr. John L. Hordern I have received a
catalogue of the latest and extremest fashions.
My soul shrinks before the awful news that a pair
of sleeves will out into six yards of stuff and that
skirts must be five-and-a-half yards round still.
But it is the kindest thing, I suppose, to let
women know the worst at once.
If the new fashions are set by society leaders
abroad, all I can think is that they must be a very
defective and skinny lot. Everything is baggy
and saggy to conceal our faults rather than to
reveal imperious charms. These are lovely times
for a girl with one shoulder higher than the other,
big feet, and narrow hips, and awful periods for
“ a fine figure of a woman ” who frantically braves
criticism sometimes in a tight and becoming
bodice and gets stared at by her own sex as if she
was a waxworks. One reassuring circumstance
about the autumnal and winter fashion-books the
shops are sending out just now is that there isn’t
even a hint of the threatened knickerbocker suit,
and no diagrams are given encouraging women
down the cloven way that leads to bifurcation.
Apropos of the bifurcated, I am told that in
Maoriland, where knickers have indisputably
caught on, you may witness the incongruous spec-
tacle of women in trouserettes wearing net veils
over their faces ! Woman’s innate and most de-
sirable vanity will always prevent her being out-
wardly quite like a man, thank goodness. She
will always have her vests shaped to her figure,
and tie her “coats” in at the back in order to
preserve the wavy outline. I really don’t think
she will ever get to look much more virile than a
pantomime “boy,” even if she does emphatically
break into breeches.
Certain fashionable circles in Maoriland are
torn with emotion over the rumors that the bride
of a few months ago has had her love’s young
dream turned into a nightmare. The bridegroom,
a good-looking youth, was reputedly wealthy, and
was prepared to do the thing well; the bride’s
pa, now reputedly un wealthy, threw no obstacles
in the way of a convincing ceremony, and the
marriage took place with circus-like glitter.
After the bow was tied (the marriage ceremony
of to-day is no knot) the happy pair left to take
the edge off the honeymoon. But in one of the
cities a mysterious female, with a solemn family
of three in tow, suddenly turned up and claimed
the happy bridegroom as her very own, the best of
the wedding-gifts were hypothecated, and hubby is
now afar off leaving both ladies behind him.
But men don’t always get the best of it like
that. For instance, it happened (in Fiji), some
years ago, that a pretty girl fell in love with a
society youth who promised her marriage “ when
his screw was raised,” but who ultimately deserted
her and married the only daughter of a wealthy
widower. Then the forlorn one took to hospital-
nursing in order to get the taste out of her
mouth, so to speak. After a lapse of years (every
thing comes to her who waits) the father-in-law
of her former flame became her patient, and she
nursed him so successfully and devotedly that the
widower, on his recovery, offered her his hand
and heart, both of which she gladly accepted.
Now, as mother-in-law to her false adorer, she
has got him under the whip. If I were that son-
in-law I would at once light out for the South
Pole.
Sydney Ladies’ Club is becoming mildly bohe-
mian in its middle age. From being the select
temple of the Sydney one hundred, and carrying
on behind hermetically-sealed doors, it now makes
a den of lions of itself by entertaining all the prin-
cipal actresses in town, and encouraging them
with tea and talk on special afternoons. Mrs.
Brough (whose notion of recreation is a long day’s
fishing) was solemnly entertained by the Club
with one or two of the younger actresses of the
co. ; Mrs. Bland Holt and Miss Spong have re-
ceived its tame hospitalities once or twice, and the
last Thespienne to be made free of the premises was
the forceful and imposing Geraldine Olliffe.
The public-ball season promises to rage fiercely
in May, and what I believe will be the first public
dance of any social weight will be the ball in aid
of the Women’s Hospital at Lewisham, to eventu-
ate in the Centennial Hall on Bth May. Tickets
at prices to meet the times, and many good names
on the patrons’ list. Mrs. (Dr.) Maguire and
Mrs, Wynn Roberts are hon. secs. The late
Governor Duff had given his patronage, and his
name still sadly adorns the tickets.
If the stage really holds the mirror up to
Nature, this must be the age of talkee-talkee. In
“Rebellious Susan,” the new advanced-woman
treatise at Sydney Lyceum, Titheradge, in beauti-
fully-fitting clothes, as the good genius of the
piece, only wanted a little table with a tumbler of
water on it and a fat man in the chair to have
been a series of highly-improving psychological
lectures —he had so many intricate orations to get
through. Everybody’s tongue seemed to be hung
in the middle so as to work easily both ways.
Fundamentally, “ Susan ” is not a knickerbocker
play—the dramatist evidently believes more
devoutly in woman’s sufferings than woman-suf-
frage, for of the two “new women” in the piece,
Susan looked silly and Elaine ridiculous. Mrs.
Quesnell (Miss Faber), who reminds me of Romeo
Greenaway, was the real heroine —an ideal “ old ”
woman, clever, softly-mannered, daintily-rigged,
and catching old birds with chaff as a natural con-
sequence. A refined and altogether charming
actress is Miss Faber, who, in the exquisite love-
scene with Titheradge, brought down the house as
i have not heard it brought down for years. By
the way, the “new” play seems co end up as
Noah’s Arkily as the old, for the couples all pair-off
for the final. Somebody ought to write a smart
play with no marriage in it, so as to give the grow-
ing hordes of he and she celibates a chance.
But, in spite of the all-saving prudence of the
Paragon female alluded to above, “ Susan” isn’t a
safe young lady for a married man to introduce
his wife to, as the carryings-on of the stage-charac-
ters sometimes leave a very lasting impression in
front. Take Watts-Phillips, for example. She is
going ’Ome shortly, whereat the married men
unanimously rejoice, for she was always uncon-
sciously teaching *heir wives to howl and squeal
and snivel and strike scornful and mock-heroic
stage attitudes in the sanctity of the domestic
hearth. So did Henrietta Watson, who set them
craning their necks like thirsty fowls and gurgling
in their conversation—so good riddance to both of
’em, say the married men. But I think they’ve a
still harder nut to crack in “Rebellious Susan”
Noble. Ravings and gurglings are really tributes
to the personal importance of Man, but a lady who
makes her triumphant exit snapping her fingers
under hubby’s astonished nose ere sallying forth
to pursue strange Johnnies through the social
wilderness is a far more risky variety to have
about the house.
The dressing is altogether lovely in “Susan.’
In the first act, Grace Noble sported a shot-pink-
and-blue silk, with folded bodice of blue velveteen
over a plain cloth vest. Miss Faber in cream,
with neck arrangement and long side-sash of brown
velvet, brown velvet toque ; and Emma Temple
in bright blue like a blue coot, with a velvet
bodice. In the second act, Miss Faber wore a
poetic confection in white chiffon, made with
many flounces edged with narrow salmon-colored
ribbon, with a frontal row of salmon-hued
rosettes—picture bodice and picture hat in
black, with a windmill-bow of salmon
chiffon A Grace Noble wore white silk, with
a purse-end sash of crepe—wide floral hat
en suite; and Emma Temple, in a reefer jacket
and a red vest, suggested yachting. In the last
act, Susan principally wears a handsome white
satin dinner-dress, with a tucker of silver and
scarlet, and braces of beaver fur covered at first
by a very scrumptious sacque of mottled pink and
white silk, with deep brown fur borderings, and
fastened at the throat with a paste buckle. Miss
Faber principally wears a black gown with jet
bodice and large red velvet sleeves—black and red
hat en suite —but Emma Temple, in a tweed suit
and a knock-about hat (in which she reminded a
score of people of a sort of glorified edition of
the woman who sells newspapers in King-street)
missed a splendid opportunity of testing the
public with the Bloomer costume in the last act.
There's a tip for the Divine Dot Boucicault.
Sydney society was astonished in the midst of
the social sackcloth-and-ashes of the Lenten
season and the mourning for the dead Governor
to read the curt announcement —even before the
engagement was whispered—of the marriage of
Mr. Allison, a Queensland squatter, with the
eldest daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Sydney Bur-
dekin. Owing to the circumstances aforemen-
tioned and to the sad bereavement lately suffered ’
by the bride’s' family, the ceremony was very
quiet, and the small wedding-party are said to
have looked like a needle in a bundle of hay—
having chosen the largest available church to get
married in. However, it’s not always the most
pompous ceremonials that hold the candle to the
happiest marriages.
People who were present,(l must say I wasn’t—
it was quite a men’s evening) at the preliminary
canter of Signor Lardelli’s new comic opera,
“ Katherine,” speak in hushed tones of deep rap-
ture about it. As Signor Lardelli intends
seriously producing it, legs and all, in the Big
Smoke where a good many shocking bad plays
come from, it is gratifying to know that
dilettanti like Mr. Bruce Smith, of the heavenly
moustache, call the composer of “ Katherine ”
the Australian Sullivan, and allude to his clever
librettist, Mrs. Marjory Brown, of Sydney, as a
“female Gilbert” who is responsible for a
“sparkling book.” lam told, however, that the
action of the opera is complete in the music and
that there is no spoken dialogue. This, if true,
is a pity, for a dialogue-less opera labors under a
heavy handicap.
Madame Gough, whose delightful translation of
Pailleron’s comedietta, : “ Le monde oh I’on
s’ennuie ” (the World of .'Boredom) kept the Rail-
way Institute full for two evenings, is to be con-
gratulated on a departure new in Australia, at
least. A clever translator of touch-and-go French
comedies, who wouldn’t use too much syrup of
Bowdler in the prescription, is just the person
Australia is howling for, it seems to me. For one
thing, Marcus Brutus Snap wouldn’t need to run
his “Australian rights” repertoire to rags and
tatters if there was a neat little lot of racy trans-
lations (not “ adaptations ”) to stop a hole to keep
the “frost” away.
Metropolitan Liedertafel concert in the big
Town Hall wasn’t a numerical success, owing to
the sudden attack of Wragge in the weather, but
the items went crisply. The 70 assisting chorus
ladies were by Florence Esdaile, Nora
O’Shaughnessy, and ’cello Strauss. Mr. J.
Edward Sykes and Mr. Ashcroft-Edwards deserve
congratulations on the spectacular and artistic
result. lam glad to see how finely Miss Esdaile
is coming along. Great things are predicted for
her—after she has gone through the inevitable Con-
tinental mill, of course—and her ultimate success
seems assured. Miss Esdaile’s triumphs will add
one more to the growing list of Victorian sopranos.
How is it that Australia’s sweetest warblers all
come from the cabbage-garden—and are nearly
all (like Miss Esdaile) of the Chosen ?

“The Case of Rebellious Susan,” at
Sydney Lyceum, distinctly raises one’s estimate
of Henry Arthur Jones. It is an exceptionally
clever and amusing comedy, though it owes much
to the admirable interpretation of the Brough-
Boucicault company. Its success is due not to
intrinsic merit of the dialogue—which is never
witty in the fashion of, say, O oar Wilde—but to
the aptness with which the dialogue is fitted to
the situations, to the scope given for humorous
characterisation, and to the utilisation of the
hundred and one smart stage trickeries - chiefly
based on the contrast of incongruities—in which
Jones is such an adept. The plot is beautifully
managed. The interest begins when the curtain
rises, and never flags till it falls finally ; there is a
nice balancing of fun and sentiment; and some
half-serious, half-satirical treatment of the deep
and abiding sex-question removes any suspicion of
flippancy.
• • «
The play turns round the revolting
woman. Young Lady Susan Harabin’a husband
has been led away by unspecified Dejilahs, and his
sin has found him at home. Rebellious Susan
flouts the advice of her elders to submit to
woman’s destiny, scorns her husband’s easy con-
trition, and vows she will pay him back in his own
coin. When she has had her little romance, they
will meet on equal terms, and she will think about
forgiveness. So she travels with a lady friend to
Cairo, where there is a young man, and a memor-
able Sunday evening. Some discussion took place
in the English papers, on the original production
of the play, as to whether the romance went as far
as the fifth act; but Susan’s subsequent conduct,
and her lover’s stress on the fact that she can
trust him no more than she has done,
put doubt quite out of the question. Susan
returns, and there is even talk of a sixth act in
the shape of an elopement to Maoriland with the
lover; but Sir Richard Kato, Q.C., Susan’s
guardian, stops that. So the lover goes to Maori-
land alone, and faithlessly weds a charming
fellow-passenger. The distressed Susan then re-
turns to her distressed husband on a bygones-
bygones agreement, content to march with the
regiment now that she has vindicated her equal
right to break the ranks.
* # •
The most considerable.corner of the play
is borne up by Mp. Titheradge, who, as Sir
Richard Kato, pulls'all .the strings of the piece.
Ilia acting combines rare strength and restraint,
and leaves nothing to be desirstß Miss Noble, who
at times has barely shunned the gulf of pretty in-
sipidity, rises as rebellious Susan to the greatest
height she has attained, and played very finely in
the passionate scene at the close of Act 2. As Mrs.
Quesnel, a middle-aged chaperonish friend of
Susan’s, Mrs. Faber strengthened her Sydney
position considerably. There is something of
monotony in her voice and facial expression, but
she acts dexterously, and is particularly effective
in the jest-and-earnest love duet with Mr. Tithe-
radge. Mr. Boucicault’s perfection goes almost
without saying, and his representation of Fergus-
son Pybus, the genius who vainly seeks sym-
pathy and afflatus, was irresistibly ludicrous.
Miss Temple, another and most aggressive revolt-
ing woman, would heighten her effects by accen-
tuating the height and masculinity and general
ugliness of Elaine Shrimpton still further. Mr.
Carey (Admiral Darley) was good ; and Mr. Ward
(Lucien Edensor) and Miss Talbot (Lady Darley)
fair; but The Bulletin’s decision on the merits of
Mr. Dorringtqn is still postponed, for his compass-
legs and his air of asininity (the latter rather too
obvious towards the close) might either be his
general stock-in-trade or his not ineffective ad-
juncts to the r6le of Lady Susan’s husband. The
only noticeable deficiency lay with Mr. Compton,
who did not make Mr. Jacomb half so fussy and
conceited and pragmatical as he might be with
advantage.
** * *
“A Million of Money,” which throws a
glow of opulence over the last weeks of Bland
Holt’s panoramadramatio season at the Theatre
Royal, hasn’t visibly aged since the same gentle-
man produced it at the Lyceum nearly two years
ago. The red-headed divinity student is still red
headed, and probably wears the same wig; while
the siren who dies of hunger on a rock with an
insane husband bounding round her with a table-
knife, and the garish ass who squanders his
uncle’s money on the siren, and the saintly
wife who squanders her affection on the garish
ass, might all have been packed away with the
scenery for any evidence of wear and tear percept-
ible. However, the short-memoried public has
forgotten all about “ A Million of Money,” and a
fresh audience rolls up every night to chuckle
over the divinity student and groan at the villain
with all the original enthusiasm ; and the season
promises to end as it began—in a blaze of specta-
cular glory and a substantial plethora of cash.

George Rignold opens Her Majesty’s again
on Saturday evening with an adaptation of
“Called Back” on a scale of immense magnifi-
cence—or, if there is anything vaster than immense
magnificence, then upon that scale. The Criterion
remains closed, though there are rumors of another
variety company contemplating entrance ; and the
Haunted Swing is turning people inside out and
suspending them over infinity by a single shoe-lace
for positively the last time or times.

Miss Amy Rosbile put in a reappearance
at the Melb. Bijou last Saturday, vice Miss
Harrie Ireland, whose glorious youtlifulness had
been her only failure in a middle-aged character.
Miss Roselle impersonates the virtuous matron of
the piece with all possible effect, but she is really
of less moment in “ A Bunch of Violets ” than
Miss Mabel Hardy. This lady’s discordant per-
formance was referred to last week. It is marked
by much misdirected earnestness and unac-
countable drapery, and the show is a
heavy sufferer thereby. Miss Muriel Carr
has taken over the ingenue part from an
amateur who didn’t make the most of her small
opportunities, and was not as satisfactory as the
new daughter, Violet, in the very important
matter of smita Miss Carr’s smile is not artless,
but it has an air of artlessless, also her figure is
fragile, and she drops her eyelids at the right
moment. Arthur Dacre, as the sentimental
bounder and chairman of “The Widow’s Mite,”
may be said to give a powerful representation of
himself. When his mannerisms are most stagey
they seem to be natural to Mr. D., and when hi
lines are cast in quiet places he seems the most
natural of actors. Mr. Daore’s performance im-
proves on acquaintance., Sydney Grundy’s play
is not calculated to grow upon the popular taste.
It jokes ponderously at the expense of labor-party
politics, and suggests, in a casual way, that work-
ing men are animated solely by beer. One only of
the male characters is distinguished for stainless
honor, and he is a noble lord. “A Bunch of
Violets ” may last over Saturday, and “ A Scrap
of Paper ” will follow.

At the little Cambridge Theatre a good
first week’s business has rewarded the Vaudeville
Comedy Company for their pains. “ A Clerical
Error ” is sympathetically treated by Frank
Emery, Oathcart, Mario Majeroni, and Miss Ida
Gresham, although the two young people have yet
to pick up a lot of wrinkles. In “ The Amazon,”
which follows H. A. Jones’ comedy, three acts of
domestic uproar are perpetrated for all they are
worth by D’Arcy Stanfield, Miss Eva Clements,
Meta Pelham, Polly Emery, and a few other people
of a cheerful nature. There ought to be room in
Melbourne for this well-appointed show, at popular
prices. “The Snowball” rolls to the fore on
Saturday, probably. • Also, there are rumors con-
cerning the Cambridge and the sacred lamp of
burlesque, and already they have started sacred
concerts on Sunday nights.
Harry Rickards, armed with new songs
and provided with an entire change of programme,
is booming away at Melb. Opera House. The
galleries are always packed, and the ground floor
is invariably crowded, and the dress-circle is
gradually being jumped by a bloated aristocracy,
which has discovered that variety shows are quite
respectable—and only cost two shillings. The
Oxford stands where it did, whilst the Victor*
Hall opens and shuts up again at intervals.

The late George Lash Gordon came out
among the original B. and B. importations as a
sort of journeyman author, rather than actor. He
localised the first burlesques that B. and B. pro-
duced at Melbourne Opera House—those almost
forgotten shows in which Fanny Robina, Royce,
Brough, Florence Harcourt, Emma Temple and
Willie Warde were chief attractions, and Mrs.
Brough appeared as a dress-suited johnnie. Few
people seem to remember Paula Tanqueray, in
broadcloth pants, singing burlesque songs ; though
her as the Fairy Queen in “lolanthe” is
often referred to. Lash Gordon played a part in
B. and B.’s maiden production, the successful
“ Turned Up and died, as it happened, a mem-

Another way of practically federating : Why
don’t the various Australian Govts, federate in placing
wines and produce 011 the European market? S.A. is
foremost as regards wine, and, by judicious advertising,
Agent-General Playford is making S.A. produce depot a
big success ; but, ere long, the different provinces will
start cutting prices and adopting all sorts of dodges to
secure the trade. Before matters go too far, the different
dep6ts should be amalgamated, and all Australian
wines, brandy, butter, and other produce sold, on com-
mission only, by one federal agency.

No Australian wines are on sale at the Imperial

The smuggling jewellers are “Mistered ” by the
Argus—men who can aute-up thousand-pound fines, on
account of their swindles, are doubtless deserving of that
distinction. Jack Smith, who goes in for freetrade in
clothing by annexing a pair of trousers at the door of a
clothing-store, is dismissed Misterless to his hominy and
plank-bed, with a reflection on the depravity and intem-
perance of the working-classes. Seriously, why should a
man who robs the State he allowed to square the robbery
with a flue ? Why should the State compound what ought
to be felonies? If stolen money is found on the convicted
thief, it is judicially restored to the prosecutor ; but that
doesn’t save the thief from gaol! Why shouldn’t revenue-
robbers go to gaol ?

Vic. butter exports for Eeb. this year almost
double the amount for the same month in '94—£121,000
against £62,000. This abnormal increase represents the
extraordinary growth of the trade. The total Australian
export now approaches in dimensions the Danish export.
It is inevitable that if the Australian rate of increase be
maintained much longer, a hopeless glut will ensue, and
the butter-trade will get on the shallows as the.wheat-
trade has done. Already a fall in London prices is an-
nounced.

The other day, a Melb. high-priestess of Venus,
urged, in vindication of her character as a financially-

left £3OO at her place, which she had at once handed over

financier? His name might afford a clue to the interpre-

The Chief Justice of Tasmania has ruled that
“ depreciation on the value of shares occuring in the fiscal
year may be deducted by taxpayers from their income
assessment, although the shares may not be actually sold
as stock.” Which reminds us of the Melb. merchant
who included among his reasons for going insolvent,
“depreciation in the value of my dwelling house and
grounds.” Tasmania seems to be a genial spot for the
bloated capitalist to roost upon. There he may form his
business into a limited liability co., retaining all the
shares in the family, and the family, by passing a few
shares from one to another at a depreciated price at the
end of each fiscal period, may escape payment of income-
tax every time. The same old depreciation will do ser-
vice from year to year, like the typical “converted" Jew.

At the meeting of Melb. Federal Coffee Palace
shareholders, last week, the chairman declared that as
long as the place was run merely as a teetotal con-
cern, the capital was hopelessly lost. The splendid pre-
mises cost £lBO,OOO to build and furnish, and the
directors can’t get a license. Last half-year’s business,
allowing for depreciation of assets, resulted in a loss of
£750, and there is not the least prospect of better things.
So the co., which is now £16,285 to the had, urges Govt,
to amend the Licensing Act by permitting an inferior
house to transfer its license, when the premises can be
run as a first-class hotel. If there is no simpler way out
of the difficulty, the Govt, shouldn’t hesitate—particu-
larly as the Savings Bank has a mortgage of £68,000 on
the building, and would find it a very inconvenient asset
to handle in case of forced foreclosure.

Statistician Coghlan estimates that N.S.W.
Superannuation Fund has a deficiency of £2,905,199, if it
is to do all it promises. The fund was insolvent when it
started, and has been getting more insolvent ever since,
the deficiency now increasing at the rate of £120,000 a
year. The 4 per cent, contribution is inadequate, and
people who had no business to draw pensions have been
allowed £36,000 per annum. To make it solvent, the
promised allowances would have to be reduced by 65 per
cent. 1 As Govt, has obviously taken money from a large
number of civil-servants on contracts which it cannot
possibly carry out, the best thing to do is to cancel
the contracts, return contributors all moneys paid,
and merge the scheme in a State Life Assurance
Department on an actuarially sound basis. The
State Life Department must come, and Civil-service
assurance would form a good nucleus for it. Outside the
State there is no absolute security.

of many Sydney residential hotels is not now
what it used to be. Many persons, however, still
prefer the regularity of a good hotel to the hurry-
scurry of a coffee palace, and to these the old
Barley Mow (now wholly rebuilt), at the corner
of Park and Castlereagh streets, is recommended.
The accommodation is modern and ample, and the
proprietor, Mr. W- Macpherson, personally Sees
to the comfort of visitors.
A BEAUTIFUL COMPLEXION.
It has long been known to scientists that for
improving the appearance and beautifying the
face oatmeal is far and away superior to all other
foods, but it had one drawback—the tendency to
heat the blood. To overcome this defect the at-
tention of eminent scientists has been devoted to
the removal of this imperfection; and now, after
long years of careful and diligent research, art has
triumphed, and Uncle Toby’s Rolled Oats is the
result, for, by skilful manipulation in the manu-
facture, all the heating properties have been ex-
tracted, so that now a beautiful complexion of
peach and ivory may be had by anyone who make*
a continuous use of Uncle Toby’s Rolled Oats.

A full-blooded Chinaman, Albert Wah

Premier Kingston is partly Irish. The

The Melb. “ society ” libel-case, Lange v.
Bige (plaintiff’s name is generally pronounced
Lang-ie) ought to be known as Slangey v. Rage,
considering the amount of bad temper and sloppy

Chairman Fitzgibbon, of the Melb. Board
of Works, sent a telegram to Lady Duff on behalf
of the Board—so he told them at their next meet-

Freeman Thomas (Lord Brassey’s son-in-
law) is a cricketer of note. He has played against
three Australian Elevens in England—for Cam-
bridge University and Sussex. He was born in
Sept., 1866, and is therefore in his 29th year.
Fitchett told the Hobart Wesleyan Con-
ference that his literary work was “ put down
every day at God’s feet.” This conception of the
Deity as assistant-editor of Stead’s magazine of
clippings marks the lowest depth of pious bathos
yet reached.
A lady who has j ust figured as co-respondent
in a divorce-ease tried abroad, is reputed to have
a big say in the ownership of a certain Australian
daily, whose impassioned articles on the social
purity question are the despair of the clergy in
the opposition shop.
So far, there has been only one District
Court Judge promoted to N.S.W. Supreme Court
bench —the late Alfred Cheeke. Mr. Justice
limes was a D.C. Judge in Queensland, and Mr.
Justice Simpson in N.S. Wales, but both resigned
to resume practice at the Bar.
In ’B3, Dr. Stanton, then Bishop of N.
Queensland, was asked to act as referee to a
school which had successfully passed the first can-
didates prepared for Sydney University examina-
tions in N.Q. “The Church has nothing to do
with education,” replied the bishop.
W. P. Buckhurst, of Melbourne, who has
been several times around the world, says there is
only one place on earth where he couldn't get a

says, “when you tell a man ‘to go to Jericho ’
you wish him more harm than you really know,”
It is not ujilikely that the new R.C. Bishop
if Port Augusta (S.A.), the see vacant by the
removal of Bishop O’Reilly to Adelaide, will
be Father Norton, of Petersburg, a Ballarat boy,
who served his time as an architect to G. R.
Johnson, and helped to draw the plans for Melb.
Theatre Royal.
Dr. Nicholson, Bart., who, according to
last mail accounts, figured at the Victoria Insti-
tute, London, in the discussion on Australian
botany, enjoys the unique privilege of having
filled the office of Speaker in both N.S.W. and
Queensland Legislative Assemblies. He is now
in his 87th year.
Vic. Statistician Hayter, one of the
brightest ornaments of the Australian Civil Ser-
vice, who died last week at 74, was in harness
almost to the last. He had been 38 years in the
Govt, service, and 11 years Vic. Govt. Statistician.
A portrait of Mr. Hayter and notice of his useful
and honorable life, appeared in The Bulletin
some months ago.
Father Tuck well, lately appointed to a
chaplaincy away in the Pyrenees, the mountain
boundary between France and Spain, was long
well-known in Manly as the “double” facially
and in carriage of the late Archbishop Vaughan.
His reverence, after leaving Melb. Custom House,
went to Europe and received ordination at the
now famous and Zolaesced Lourdes. A few
months ago he was transferred from Redfern to
Granville, where one of the late storms blew the
roof off his church.
Queensland seems to have disagreed with
most of its Governors, George Bowen, its first
ruler (1859), and Norman (its present) being the
only two of its seven Governors left alive. The
others were Blackall, Normanby, Cairns, Ken-
nedy, and Musgrave. N.S. Wales has, perhaps,
the longest list of ex-Governors living—Belmore,
Robinson, Loftus, Carington, and Jersey. Vic-
toria has Barkly, Bowen, Loch and Hopetoun;
while South Australia has the oldest living ex-
Viceroy, George Grey, who, 53 years ago, ruled in
Adelaide.
James Whiteside M‘Cay, of Castlemaine,
was the other day rated LL.B. of Melb. Univer-
sity, after having obtained first-class honors in
every year, without a break. The exhibition,
£2OO, was awarded to him this year. He is about
the only man, except Isaacs, who has done so
brilliant a course in Vic. M‘Cay is quite a pro-
minent politician in Castlemaine, and has strong
democratic leanings. It was principally at his
instance, and by his support, that E. D. Williams
came out against Patterson at last election, Pat-
terson being relegated to second place on the poll.
The grandfather of Miss Maud FitzStubbs
(Mrs. Harry Woods, the clever musical composer,
who has just left Sydney for London), was “ Tom”
Stubbs (a perfect fac-simile of His Glorious
Majesty George IV.), the most flowery of Mel-
bourne auctioneers in the fifties, and the writer of

TOT (after the departure of her aunt's lover) : “I think there's
somethin' wrong with you inside. ”
AUNT : “ Gracious, child—why?"

speak EVERY time that man squeezed you.”
some of the most eloquent advts. on record.
Archibald Michie, while lecturing on “News-
papers,” once “sold” the reporters deliciously
“There is one writer on the metropolitan press,”
he said, “whom it always delights me to read.”
Here the scribes paused, in anxious expectation—
“and that is my old and valued friend, Tom
Stubbs! ”
A wretched little denominational print,
Victorian Churchman, descends to the very
depths of meanness in its current issue. Lord
Rosebery has conferred a civil-list pension on the
widow of the late Dr. Pearson, scholar, historian,
journalist, and Radical politician, on account of
her husband’s distinguished literary and political
services. The Churchman waxes indignant at
this because Pearson Was “ practically a pro-
nounced Agnostic,” and also because of “ his
opposition to the introduction of Scriptural lessons
into our Public-schools.” It is oidy a professional
Christian paper which could descend to the loath-
some meanness of jealously grudging the payment
of a small sum to a widow, on account of its objec-
tion to the political work of her husband in his
lifetime.
The Duchess of Leinster died last week,
and the cable-man sent the sad news along, as
though Australia took an interest in the lady. It
happened that Australia was remotely interested
quite unbeknown to itself. The Duchess’s brother
married Alice Leamar’s sister—and separated
from her in due season.
There is no sign yet of a bust or painting
of Chief Justice Higinbotham, the noblest Roman
of them all, being placed in the Melb. Law Courts
library, where Justices Mules worth, Fellows, and
Barry, and Chief Justice A’Beckett are com-
memorated. C. J. Stawell is in the picture
gallery, as an ex-Acting Governor.
There has been a squabble among the
three “ experts ” appointed to enquire why Vic.
railways don’t pay, and one of them, Mr. Cain
(a former Mayor of Melbourne), says he’ll resign.
The other day Premier Turner, meeting in the
street Judge Casey, one of the commissioners,
asked “How about Cain?” “How should I
know ?” replied Casey ; “ I’m not my brother’s
keeper.”
In certain—say North Queensland —police-
courts the course of justice is very summary. In
obscene-language cases one magistrate insists on
the arresting constable reciting on oath the exact
words used. The other day a constable much de-
murred, but the magistrate was firm. “ Well,
your worship, the accused said that the
(meaning your worship) was the worst drunkard
in ” “Three months,” said the beak.
It would appear
that a N.S.W. District
Court Judge has been
distinguishing himself
again —by referring to
people present in the
body of the court (includ-
ing—but he doesn't know
this -sev e r a 1 very
respectable residents) as
“ a filthy-minded lot of
loafers.” No need to
give his Honor’s name.
The gentleman’s epithets
identify him.
The fact that George
Lewis, solicitor for the
Marquis of Queensberry,
has withdrawn from the
shocking Wilde libel-case,
does not necessarily throw
discredit on Queensberrj 7
—or on anyone else.
Lewis may have business
reasons for cutting all
connection with so loath-
some a scandal. He is
“everybody’s solicitor,”
and the names of some of
his clients are being
dragged into court.
Queensberry being only
one client, and not a very
rich one at that, the
wonder is, not that Lewis
withdrew from the case,
but that he ever took in-
structions for the de-
fence. One circumstance
is quite as significant as
the other.
Premier Reid’s use
of an eyeglass is no mere
affectation, as was shown
the other day in N.S.W,
Full Court, on the occa-
sion of the installation as
a Judge of ex-Attorney-
General Simpson. It is
ordinarily the custom for
the junior Judge to sit
at the extreme left of the
bench, but on this occa-
sion the Judges had, as a
compliment, seated the
new Judge on their ex-
treme right. Mr. Reid,
devoid of his eye-glass,
proceeded to address his
congratulations to the
left of the bench, where
sat Mr. Justice Manning;
but, later on, a barrister
having nudged the
speaker and explained
matters to him, he aimed
the rest of his oration at
the right quarter.
David Syme has issued an edict that the
Argus is not to be alluded to as “ our contem-
porary.” David believes the Argus to be half-a-
century behind the Age.
George Ash, of whom a portrait is here
printed, is one of the youngest, and at the same
time one of the most interesting figures in the
S.A. Parliament. Though not yet 40, he
served in the Cape Volunteer Force during
the Kaffir War of 1877. He was then a
journalist, and became . a soldier because the
Commandant refused him permission to go to
the front in any other capacity. He came
to S.A. shortly after the conclusion of the
campaign, and in ’BO, in conjunction with J. B.
Mather, now artist on the staff of the Adelaide
Advertiser, obtained possession of the Narra-
coorte Herald, the price agreed to be paid for the
paper being .£3OOO, He worked very hard as
editor, and after nine years’ labor "had just
managed to pay off the indebtedness to the
firm from which the Herald was purchased.
He also had acquired a house and seventeen
acres of land, on which his expenditure in
money was more than ,£l3OO. In April
1889, the Herald published strictures on th >
e
conduct of a local squatter, and the biggest libel-
action ever heard in S.A. resulted. It lasted
more than three weeks, despite the refusal o(
Judge Buuoaut to admit the evidence of 40 wit-
nesses subpoenaed to testify to the facts allege(l in
the article complained of. In the end a verdict
for plaintiff for £5250 was given by 9 votes against
Photo, by Frihling pnd Co.] [Adelaide.
GEORGE ASH , M.P.
3, the minority capitulating to save trouble.
The costs exceeded .£2OOO. Mr. Ash con-
ducted his own case with great ability, and
won considerable popularity by his courage and
resource. Nevertheless he and his partner left
the court ruined men. Time to realise the estate
and pay verdict and costs was refused. The
home which had cost Mr. Ash .£l7OO was sold for
.£240, and his share in tiie paper was sacrificed in
similar fashion. The Insolvent Court followed
the libel-case, all Ash’s furniture being also swal-
lowed. “I was literally without a penny,” said
Mr. Ash to the writer, “and my wife and I had
to live chiefly on rabbits for three months.” In
compliance with a requisition from the people
of Albert the constituency in which the
Herald had been conducted —he stood for
the electorate at the next general election
(April, 1890), all the money at his command
to meet living and Campaign expenses being
a sum subscribed by admirers and presented to
his wife. On April 9, 1890—exactly a year after
the publication of the article which caused the
libel-action—Mr. Ash was returned at the top of
the poll for Albert. He saw that he could not
live independently on the .£2OO a year Parlia-
mentary pay, and at the end of the first session he
determined to study for the law. Mr. Kingston,
Q.C. (now Premier) offered to give him his articles
if he passed matriculation, and Ash bought the
necessary books and set to work, and for eight
weeks stuck to his studies for 14 hours daily.
He was successful, to the surprise of everyone, and,
finishing Ids examination on the Friday, he began
his law-course on the following Monday. During
his University career he twice took the highest
scholarships in law at the end of successive terms,
and on Dec. 19,1894, took the Bachelor of Laws
degree, being the first student to qualify under
the new regulations. Directly afterwards he was
admitted into partnership with the Premier
(Kingston, Q.C.). It is significant that while Ash
passed in 54'separate papers during his University
career and spent 119 J hours in answering the
questions, the only query put by the examiners to
Kingston, Q.C.—when he qualified for admission
years ago—was “ What will you take to drink ?”
This being replied to tactfully, he was
allowed to practice. Ash in Parliament has won
a reputation for indomitable perseverance, utter
consistency, bull-dog courage, and kindness of
heart. In many things, he is ultra-conservative.
He is a freetrader and a tireless advocate for the
opening of Crown lands for settlement. Many a
squatter has had to giveupcoveted leases becauseof
his agitation. Though in the past an articled-clerk
and now a partner of Kingston, he is a thoroughly
independent member, and the most caustic criti-
cism of Government measures has often come
from him. He votes against the Ministry, too,
and if there is a no-confidence motion when the
House meets, will probably help to turn the
Government out. Many are the skirmishes which
have taken place between him and the Labor-
party, who dislike him intensely—and it is pro-
phesied that, as most of the S.A. village-
settlements have been established in Albert,
he will be dismissed from the representation of
the district next year in favor of a less rigid
individualist. He was the first S.A. legislator to
definitely and decidedly decline to subscribe to
football clubs and other similar district institu-
tions for extorting money from politicians, but he
makes a point of answering every letter written to
him by a constituent, and his correspondence is
tremendous. He is always busy either writing or
reading in the House, and in attendance and in
his votes on divisions is exemplary. He speaks
well and has a bright fund of humor.
HOT CLIMATES.—“I cannot refrain from
adding my testimony to the great efficiency of your
‘ FRUIT SALT ’ here. I have a store, and as
numerous travellers are constantly passing, and
the climate being extremely hot, frequently 110° in
the shade, there is naturally much drink consumed.
It is a colonial custom that if a traveller drops in
your store, to ask the proprietor to ‘liquor;’ I did
‘liquor’ for some considerable time, and found
my liver gradually increasing in consequence.
Having been recommended your excellent ‘FKUIT
SALT,’ I steadily applied myself to six bottles in
accordance with the instructions given, and I feel
myself bound to say that the result was not only
satisfactory, but, I believe, has permanently re-
duced my liver to its normal size. Since then I
invariably use your ‘FRUIT SALT ’ when asked
to ‘liquor’ in place of the beverage which in-
ebriates and doesn’t always cheer, and charge the
customer as per usual. I remain, Sir, yours truly,

South Africa. J. C. End, Esq.” Sold by all

It is generally understood that W. H.
Suttor’s resignation of the Vice-Presidentship of
N.S.W. Executive is due to his disapproval of
Premier Reid’s Land-Tax proposals.
Victorian parsons who decry Secularism
are Secularists to a rnan in the matter of the State

They are too lazy to do it themselves.
A few months ago the Vic. selectors’
arrears were only .£500,000. On the publication
of this, all hands determined not to pay any more,
and so the arrears are now =£750,000.
Several Queensland M.’sL.A. pay far more
than the amount of their Parliamentary salaries
to substitutes to conduct their businesses during
the time they are in Brisbane attending Parlia-
ment.
The Payment of Members Bill proposed
by the Rosebery Government is to be a payment
out of the rates of each electorate, thus coming
within the sphere of payment Parkes and Dibbs
occasionally favor.
The backbone of the present Sydney city-
railway agitation consists of certain individuals
who have on hand big and unprofitable Circular
Quay land-specs., and who somehow never talk
or write betterment tax.
Nearly every one of the Vic. ex-Ms. P.
who have, so far, omitted to surrender their Par
liamentary railway-passes, belongs to the Tory side
of the House, and was formerly a blatant bar-
racker for the defeated Patterson.
“What status had the self-constituted
‘Conference of Premiers ’ aerainst the great his-
torical Convention ? pan the lesser overrule the
greater ? Can a coterie of mice claim for itself the
mastery over a gathering of lions ?”-— Parkes.
The State itself must directly conduct the
grog-traffic. A Sydney publican fined for selling
brandy unfit for human consumption pleaded that,
save for the admixture of water, he sold the liquor
just as he got it from the wholesale dealer. Who
can possibly decide between the merchant and the
publican ? To place the matter beyond doubt all
temptation to adulterate must be removed. The
State alone would have no such temptation.
In a week or two,
the only Governor on
the Australian conti-
nent will be General
Norman, of Q’sland.
N.S.W. Legisla-
tiveOouncil has killed
another democratic
proposal — the pro-
posal to reform the
Marine Board by
allowing several re-
presentative bodies to
nominate one mem-
ber each. At present
four members are
supposed to be nomi-
nated by Govt., and
three by the ship-
owners; but the ship-
owners practically
nominate the lot.
Hence the difficulties
thrown in the way of
public redress in cases
of overcrowding,
under-manning, and
deficient provision of
boats and safety ap-
pliances. The accom-
modation provided in
many boats which
have left Sydney for
Westralia and Maori-
land has been simply
scandalous; yet a
deputation of ship-
ping companies had
the impudence the
other day to ask Pre-
mier Reid to further
reduce their responsi-
bilities. The N.S.W.
shipping laws will
bear a lot of improve-
ment, as soon as a
Government can be
found able and willing
to improve them.
It is believed there has been a row in the
Kingston Ministry because of the appointment of
a Commission to enquire into the Adelaide hospital
dispute. The trouble arose because of the pro-
motion of Chief Secretary Gordon’s sister over
the heads of a number of senior nurses. The
Govt, confirmed the appointment while Premier
Kingston was away in Hobart, and, the public
clamoring, he insisted upon an independent in-
vestigation of the matter when he returned.
A commentary upon the Archbishop of
Canterbury's assertion as to the godless and sinful
character of young Victorians (based on clerically-
garbled statistics flatly contradicted by Hayter)
is the fact that, owing to the dearth of crimin-
ality, Govt, is reducing the official staffs at
country gaols.
“ When we approach the province of
nation-making it is difficult for Premier Reid, and
men who grope in his narrow track of thought,
to comprehend the situation. We might as well
expect a guinea-pig to take a correct survey of the
stars. The poor guinea-pig can never rise to the
occasion. ” — Parkes.
N.S.W. ex-Minister Lyne’s wail over the
existence of the Labor-party is piteous. “They
wanted two clearly-divided parties to secure the
continued existence of Party Government, which
was the heart and soul of public life.” Two’s
company and three’s none! The Gooseberry-
party of politics—the Labor-party.
Premier Reid has already added two mem-
bers to N.S.W, Legislative Council. They are
officeholders in the Government, of course, but
still they are Reid appointments to the Council,
and, if they resign, one the Vice-Presidency and
the other the Attorney-Generalship, both may
continue to sit in the Council for life.
The Vic. Naval Brigade was recently mar-
shalled before the new Commandant under strict
injunctions to wear no gaiters. In view of the
absence of war-clouds from the Age cables, gaiters
have been put on a peace footing, but the enemy
need not flatter itself. Though Victoria’s gaiters
have joined the reserves, they are ready for action.
He was a Bananaland M.L.C. who sim-
mers in continual indignation at the scandal of
payment of members. A few weeks after one of
his fiery diatribes against this iniquity he wrote
to the Railway-Commissioners, enquiring if his
position as legislator entitled him to have wood
and water carried free on the public railway to his
suburban residence.
As to the fraudulent and time-expired
free-pass question, why, The Bulletin again
asks, don’t the various Australian railway-depart-
ments change yearly the metal of which passes are
made? Last year’s pass say, of engraved silver ;
this year’s of engraved copper. A square pass
last year, a triangular one this year. Then there
could be no mistake.
“ We began writing for it (the eight-hours
principle) 40 years ago,” says the Argus. Next
century that paper will be boasting how it was one
of the first to make popular the principles of
Anarchy, and how it was a member of the Argus
staff that invented the patent Death-to-Fat-
Men bomb whicli secured such privileges for
the Australian working-man.
“ If we give Justices of the Peace enor-
mous powers over the liberties of the people—
powers in some respects far higher than those
given to the Judges of the Supreme Court, who
can sentence a man to imprisonment only after he
has been convicted by a common jury—it would
be only reasonable to take some steps to ascertain
that justices know the law they administer.
Justices of the Peace should be required to prove
by certificate of examination that they are
acquainted with the rudiments of the law whieh
they have to administer. For my part, I should
very much desire to see unpaid justices done awa >-
with altogether. Higinbotham.
INTERNATIONAL BITTERNESS, ENGENDERED BY THE
REGENT TEST-MATCH.
ENGLISH JOHNNIE : “ How is it that wheahevah an Englishman goes
he is always an Englishman ?”
AUSTRALIAN ACQUAINTANCE : “ Well, I suppose on the same prin-
ciple that wherever an ass goes he is always an ass.”
At latest, Henniker Heaton was address-
ing an enthusiastic meeting of his Canterbury
Tory constituents, and swearing that the Conser-
vative members would never handle a penny of
the proposed parliamentary pay, but would “ pass
it over to the sick and aged.” That sounds well,
but it is only the sound of the fall of Dives’ crumbs.
The vulgar Labor-member Lazarus has not so
many sausages on his table that he can afford to
sweep them off with Ins elbows.
Apropos of Deakin’s lecture on Liberalism,
Melb. Argus says: “ He fancies himself a new
species of Supreme Being.” Well, that is a harm-
less conceit common to moat men, and to none so
much as Mr. Haddon, who sub-edits the Al-
mighty’s copy every evening, and daily prints his
Fat Man’s version of the Universe “ in the place
where I am demanded by conscience to speak
the truth.”
Melb. journalist: “The Argus keeps
going down, down, down in public estimation.
What it ought to do is to cut under the Age for
the support of the masses, but, unfortunately, it is
choked with the fossilarians, who haven’t had
time to die out. Meanwhile, the Age has
retreated again to its Conservative attitude, from

ARTURNED W.A. PROSPECTOR (to his wife):

Dr. Garran surrendered office in N.S.W.
Legislative Council to take the Presidency of the
Conciliation and Arbitration Board. In due time
that Board was abolished, and now Dr. Garran is
“elevated back” to his old position. Garrard
has an Amended Trades Disputes Conciliation
Bill now before the Assembly, and when this Bill
reaches the Council it will naturally, from Dr.
Garran’s past experience of the question, fall
to him to nurse and defend. If it becomes
law, will Dr. Garran be “elevated down” and
“promoted back” to the stipendiary Presidency
of the Board once more ?
The Argus has discovered that one man
out of every 400 in Victoria was convicted of
cheating the Customs last year, and thinks this a
strong argument in favor of a return to Freetrade.
According to this, if one person out of 200 were
legally convicted annpally of some offence, there
would be 100 per cent, more reason for abolishing
laws altogether than there is for instituting Free-
trade. Freetrade is wanted, in the interests of
morality, to abolish smugglers; therefore, free
love is wanted to abolish bigamists; also, if
there were no coins there would be no coiners,
for which reason the monetary system is iniquitous
and must be wiped out. The Argus, the organ
of Anarchy, one penny, all news-agents.
The whirligig of time. Melb. Argus
supported the candidature of Broguey Man
O’Loghlen at last Carlton bye-election, yet this
is the notification which he published in the Go-
vernment Gazette of 20th Feb,, 1879, during his
tenure of office as Vic. Premier
NOTICE.
In consequence of the fabrication by and the publica-
tion in the Argus journal of false news, purporting to be
genuine and authoritative, concerning the proceedings
and discussions of the Cabinet, being continuously per-
severed in for several weeks last past (sic), the public are
hereby cautioned against giving any credence to either
those statements, or any similar kind of news tor the
future in the journal. The Argus has been refused any
official information of the kind by the acting Chief Secre-
tary, who feels justified in the taking this course, as that
journal has for several months unpatriotically attempted
to depreciate the financial credit of Victoria.
Bryan O’Loghlen,
Chief Secretary’s Office, Acting Chief Secretary.
Melb., 20th Feb., 1879.
Premier Reid simply paralysed Parkes
when the latter, last week, with a view to pro-
voking a crisis, moved the adjournment of N.S.W.
Assembly to “draw attention to the confusion
into which the Government has plunged the coun-
try ” —though he (Parkes) had ju t voted against
Dibbs’motion to a similar effect. Georgey-Porgey
Reid is a! ways good at a back-answer, but he lias
rarely, if ever, reached the virulence, neatness,
and dramatic intensity of retort which he exhibited
on this occasion. His squeaky voice was raised to
its shrillest pitch as he pointed to the Opposition
benches, and told the played-out king of the Kiama
ghosts: “Your place is there! We want no
traitors in the Freetrade' camp.” The Minis-
terialists cheered again and again, while the Oppo-
sition sat and enjoyed the fun, and the old man
impotent couldn’t even muster strength to reply.
It is really time the fallen idol retired from
politics and devoted himself exclusively to corres-
pondence with “Mister” Gladstone,
The Yic. President of Melb. Hardware
Association complained to Vie. Tariff Board that
the trade is demoralised every June in anticipa-
tion of the Treasurer’s Budget. Protection, the
nn-settled policy of the country, has many things
to contend with, but one of the worst is tariff-
tinkering. A community may accommodate itself
to even a bad tariff, but the wavering policy that
ventures forward in one session and retrogresses in
panic the next, is a monstrous libel on the policy
of Protection. A tariff should not be a job-lot of
mixed taxes —it should be formulated with care
and maintained with firmness.
Bryan O’Loghlen, speaking at Carlton
before the election, propounded a characteristically
O’Loghlenian scheme for the restoration of pros-
perity. First of all, the Govt, was to lend the
reconstructed banks several millions for the pur-
pose of creating “ confidence,” secondly, the afore-
said banks were to lend several millions (presum-
ably the same) to the Govt, with the same laudable
object. Then things were to begin booming, and
the old infallible receipt of borrowing £20,000,000
and spending it was to follow. The Broguey
Man is, as a rule, a startlingly original financier,
but this latest proposal is obviously borrowed from
the two Irishmen in the yarn who bought a keg of
whisky and proceeded to make a fortune out of
retailing it at sixpence a drink to one another.
The raw-boned offspring of Parry-Okeden,
Q. Under-Col, Secretary, Was, the other day,
quietly appointed Aoting-Sub-Inspector of
Police at <£2oo a year, while scores of capable
tnen of double his years already in the
service plead vainly for promoting. It is
hardly three years since this youngster
left Brisbane Grammar School, and after
a couple of years in a subordinate place
in the Q.N. Bank, Ije was jumped into
his present position. He gets the billet,
so far as can be judged by the public,
simply because he is/the son of his father,
who was thought to have done good ser-
vice to Government as magistrate in
charge of the disturbed districts during
the recent bushworkers’ strike. Mean-
while, a former high Ipcal military
official —scholar, officer, and gentleman
was taking admis'sion - tickets for a
living at the last match the English
cricketers played in Brisbane. There
is nobody in the province better
qualified for the billet dropped into
callow Okeden’s beak.- But, in Kana-
kaland, kissing goes by father.
The appointment of Ur. (Jar-
ran, late editor of S. M. HekaLP,
as Vice-President of N.S. Wales
Executive Council is regarded as
a Ministerial sop to the Herald
aforesaid, the Reid crowd being
popularly regarded as in some
sort the creations and proteges
s of the rival Daily Telegraph.
Like his predecessor, Mr. W. H.
Suttor, Dr. Garran ostensibly
receives no salary, but it is pre-
■" sumed that the office is subsidised
by the other Ministers.
Annual Vic. pension-tax, £1

“I doubt,” says a Bulletin correspon-
dent, “ whether there is any real necessity for
paying Australian Governors. If you secretly
auctioned the N.S.W. Governorship in London
you would get high bids from a thousand ambitious
snobs.”
Guildford (W.A.) licensing bench was
“knocked endways” the other day by receipt of
a telegram from one of the Forrest gang, saying
“ he objected ” to the granting of a certain license
applied for. Whether this was intended. as. evi-
dence, or as an attempt to browbeat the Bench on
behalf of a competing publican, doesn’t appear,
but the incident shows the colossal impudence of
W.A. magnates. The Bench granted the license,
A standing curse of S. Australia is the
“Royal Commission ” business, a device of needy
politicians to make hay in summer outside their
salaries. The N. Territory Commission has just
decided to visit Queensland in April to enquire
into the labor question, and the S.A. taxpayer
will have to foot a bill for .£2OOO or .£3OOO
to provide a health trip for politicians, while he
himself is wearing patched clothes and living on
two meals a day. The coolie labor-question is as
dead as Julius Caesar in S.A., and a while ago the
Assembly decided against alien labor being em-
ployed in the N.T.; but Commissioners never lack
gall to invent a barefaced device for a cheap holi-
day. A trip to Sydney or Hobart to enquire into
the price of fish "would have been quite as bene-
ficial.
In supporting the N.S.W- Medical Prac-
titioners’ Bill, which makes all practitioners state
clearly their qualifications, G. R. Dibbs stated
that a Sidney quack-doctor, who had been a
boatswain, “boasted to him that he had made a
fortune of <£150,000 by the practice of medicine,
and that it had cost him from <£l7oo to <£2ooo a
year in fighting this bill. He (Dibbs) sent this
person to the Minister for Justice, to whom he re-
peated his statements.” The second reading of
the bill was carried by 52 votes to 14, and The
Bulletin is sorry to see the minority composed
chiefly of Labor members. Every man Jack of
those Labor members would to-morrow vote for a
bill for branding Chinese-made furniture. Why
shouldn’t a quack-doctor have to brand his goods?
What injustice would be done if every man had to
brand his goods ?

It has been proposed to retrench to £5000 per annum the salaries attaching to the N.S.W. Governorship. But think of the opportunities in a young country like this I Govt. is paying 10S. a head for sharks, and an Australian
Governor by sobriety, and industry, might double his income as above.

Sydney Dairy Teeegraph solemnly began
its commercial article the other day :
The mortal nature of the Governor’s illness was not
generally understood until the afternoon, and a slow but
fairly steady business was reported. The report for the
entire week is on very similar lines. The turnover has
not at any point been active, but the tone has been good,
and prices well supported. On the Stock Exchange, &c.
Which is an even more beautiful anti-climax than
a passage from the D.T.’s eloquent description of
the gubernatorial funeral-procession :
Ahead, between the trees, the hearse and the flower-
decked gun-carriage, leading a long line of cabs.
A long line of cabs is indeed a romantic and
solemn circumstance. Then again :
It (the grave) is an ideal resting place. On one side lie
the remains of the late Lord Ancram, on the other those of
the late R‘v. Alex. Milne Jarvie, whilst the vaults of the
families of Sir F. M. Darien and Sir Georje Innes are
in the immediate vicinity
Then the D.T. tells us that “slowly the sun sank
in the West”—as if on days when Governors
were not buried it sank in the Bast at 60 miles an
hour ! Australia will never be a Republic, will
never be anything but what it is—an old-young
people with a rising generation of boys growing
up on cheap cigarettes an i unoriginal blasphemy,
and girls on cheek and rice-powder—so long as
such stuff is published.
The S.M. Herald was equally idiotic. On
two days it mourned with upturned column-rules
over four of its pages. Why it didn’t mourn over
the remaining pages i in’t clear. As it was, the
shipping news was in a very bad way over Gov.
Dulf’s death, while the theatrical and commercial
columns couldn’t squeeze a tear. Much obvious
woe, also, was slobbered over the “lost and
found ” advts., and the “situations wanted,”
while the “auction sales” and money-lending
announcements were quite unmoved. Bub the
abject, crawling, horrible bathos of the page
devoted to an account of poor Gov. Duff’s death
more than atones for these superficial discrepan-
cies. To read it is to squirm with disgust.
* * *
S.M. Herald gubernatorial-funeral en-
thusiasm :
The Principal Under Secretary’s first step was to com-
mit to Mr. O. Kinsela administrative details. Mr. Kinsela,
in his turn, whilst guarding his staff from the preparation
of anything that would be at all ostentatious, laid it down
that everything was to be incomparably perfect.
Elsewhere we read that “the coffin was lined
with swansdown ” —no doubt the undertaker’s
idea of incomparable perfection. Ugh ! After
this the story of the old lady who died last week
at Melbourne, and whose body was, at her own
request, burnt to ashes on a wood-pile by the sea,
the lighting match being applied by her son,
comes as a breezy relief.

In Melbourne Criminal
Court, the other day, a cer-
tain dreary old barrister
begged the jury to send the
prisoner home to his wife
and children without a stain
on his character, or, at any-
rate, to recommend the
family bread-winner to
mercy for the sake of his
dear ones. The aforesaid
prisoner was a bachelor, as
it happened. “ Remember,
you are on your oath,"’
thunders learned counsel at
the respectable witness in
the box, yet the bewigged
bully may fire off an 81-ton
cram without fear -of the con-
sequences. He’s not on his
oath. Our oath ! no.

There is a mild uproar
in Melbourne tooth-pulling
circles over the new Dental
College idea. Now that a
level-handed practitioner
has set up a Training-school
“on his own,” a number of
others, who might have done
the same thing on their own,
are secretly amenting their
want of savee in the dead
past. A Dental College is
needed and will soon pay
its way. therefore the foun-
der, who has fairly and
squarely put himself in a
position to draw the fees, is
an object of indignation to
his fellow dentist. And
probably the old haunting
dread of female competition
has a good deal to do with
the case. The College pros-
pectus recommended the
art of tooth-filling only to
the notice of the ladies.
But two of the pioneer girl
students, after taking a l w
lessons, have decided to g-,
the whole course in deni is
try —study dissections, &<■.,
at the University—and th y
will in due season be apply-
ing for certifs.
That sea s'iorecremation —the first in Victoria—
was, however, not an unqualified success, for at
one stage the skull of the deceased showed out
and some wood thrown over it caused it to break
and expose the brain. The crudeness of this
attempt should stimulate St. Kilda Cemetery
trustees to quickly provide their crematorium,
as repetition would tend to prejudice the public
against the rational disposal of the dead.
# * *
Half-moon Bay, where this rough-and-
ready cremation occurred, is a picnic resort, and
an audience soon assembled to discuss the burning
question and give advice. Meanwhile, a small
picnic-party not far off was placidly devouring its
victuals and drinking beer out of a billy, and a
knob of fishermen standing near were making
anxious enquiries as to whether deceased wore any
rings or other valuables. The remains were not
collected, but the relatives and friends of deceased
intimated their intention of making pilgrimages
to the spot. If they go soon they need not be sur-
prised to find an enterprising fisherman, with a
cradle and tin dish, fossicking among the ashes.

The Sandringham (Vic.) people are ob-
jecting to cremations being performed there in the
present fashion. They have now had two within

Apropos several recent dinners. To give
a banquet in a man’s honor is the greediest form
of compliment. Like “the quality of mercy,”
“ it blesseth him that gives and him that takes.”
The giver gets as much out of it as the getter. It
is a kind of a co-operative compliment, in which
the cornplimenters are partners, and the compli-
raentee gets no more than a free meal and a suc-
cession of hiccupy speeches. Giving public dinners
to people is just as selfish as sending advertise-
ments —we mean ticketed wreaths —to their
funerals.
By the way, two days after Gov. Duff’s funeral,
lists of people who had attended the funeral, but
whose names had been omitted from the first news-
paper-lists, appeared in the Sydney dailies. It
will interest the public to know that, with hardly
an exception, the persons whose names were re-
corded in these second lists, wrote in to the news-
paper offices asking that their names should lie
printed. And so, for that matter, did a large
number of the people whose names were in the
first lists. For such is the immodesty of the pre-
tentious humbug and pompous self-advertising
nobody.

A coming sensation is a divorce-suit in
which a well-connected wealthy Englishman will
figure as co-respondent. It is alleged that the
husband had his wife “shadowed,” and on her
return home one night she was refused admittance.
To express her indignation as forcibly as possible
she proceeded to break all the windows in hubby’s
domicile, and was only removed by main force in
the person of two policemen, to the great delecta-
tion of a fashionable neighborhood. Madame’s
petits sou per s (during her husband’s absence) are
vividly remembered by a large number of gilded
youth.

Tha “Vagabond” suggests the intro-
duction of a co-operative kitchen system into
Australia. What a chance for professional philan-
thropy to form a syndicate and make money by
well-doing ! A co-operative kitchen would mean
a return of good temper and good looks to the
average poor man’s wife, who now divides her
time between cooking and cleaning, and cursing
the hour when she got married.

Mr. Blacket should have stayed in Victoria and
tried to find out what is the matter with 19th-
century Christianity.
One paper, by the way, ventures the queer
statement that, in parts of Persia, the heat is so
great that travellers are compelled to wrap them-
selves in rugs and blankets “in order to induce
normal perspiration. ” Ere leaving Melbourne, Mr.
Blacket was presented with a purse. He will thus
progress through the positive, comparative, and
superlative—Purse, Pursia, and Purspiration!
Good, isn’t it?

Just after Wallington of the wondrous
bow, Gov. Hopetoun’s secretary, had packed up
the extraordinary collection of photographs of
actresses and pretty society girls which used to
adorn his official room at Guvmentouse, and made
his plans for a long stay in England, as Gov.
Duff’s death had upset his Sydney arrangements,
Lord Brassey sent him a second offer to remain
as his secretary. Mr. Wallington jumped at it.
This will annoy quite a lot of people. Walling-
ton knows all about everybody, and is really
responsible for the strict “ etiquette ” Witli which
the Hopetouns have regulated their socialities. It
is beastly rough on some folks to have Brassey
coached up in all the horrors before he arrives.

“Fritz” Lange’s allegation of unfair treat-
ment at Oxford University on account of his
being an Australian, which was adduced at the
trial as evidence of insanity, may not be absolutely
groundless. The young fellow is apparently a
boy of the most bigotedly patriotic views, and not
at all one to accept the superior airs of the scions
of old nobility. Young Lange’s undisguised lack
of admiration for University rowing would not be
likely to increase the popularity at Oxford.

goes to the hospital and the balance to the doctor.
As this ward was erected and furnished .at the

room in the paying ward ?
A Sydney lady has just

anxious to make a tempor-

another (the last one)

Too woomba and Rock-

enviable notoriety for the
severity of their juries. It
was Rockhampton that
found a Mount Morgan
Chinese guilty of homicide
on practically no evidence
at all—a decision set at
naught by the Cabinet,
which liberated the Chow
within 18 months. Rock-
hampton juries always do
their duty by the Boodle-
wraith in political trials.
It is easily understood,
however. A juror cooped
up in a crowded den for
many hours at a lime, with
the thermometer 120 de-
grees in the refrigerator,
must have someone’s blood.
No man ought to be tried
for life by a jury locked-up

A Melb. “ society”
paper tells “ Lassie ” that
she may go and see her
Gnssie, who is ill in bed :
“ Put on your most becom-
ing garments; if possible,
wear a tiny spray of his
favorite flower, and carry
into the sick room your
very brightest smile, even
should your heart ache and
your courage well nigh fail.
Do not object to the pre-
sence of the nurse, and, at
a sign from her, at once say
goodbye to your loved one,
leaving with him the sweet
white carnations you had
worn and the memory of
your loving smiles, to com-
fort him till ‘to-morrow.’ ”
Ain’t it sickenin’ ?
The awfulness of a marine catastrophe is measured, in
the daily press, by the rank and station of the victims.
Take two recent headings from Melb. Argus— “ Wreck of
the Schooner Martha. Capsized in the Rip. All on
board drowned." “Shocking Boating Accident near
Perth. Four well-known men drowned." The Age
announcements were—“ Capsized in the Rip. A Tas-
manian Schooner Founders. Three Lives Lost ’’ ; and
“Terrible Yachting Fatality. Four-gentlemen drowned
at Perth.”—
Two different Melb. establishments adver-
tise “medical advice and medicine, 2s. 6d.,”and
most of the very best suburban men are now quite
content with a ss. fee for consultation. Times
have changed ! Twenty years ago any sober,
decently-qualified young medico could land in
Australia without a cent, settle down almost at
once to a good practice in the country, marry a
squatter’s daughter, and, if he kept sober, retire
with a fortune in ten years. Now there are six
red lamps in every street and one under nearly-
every gum-tree. But still there is room —at the
top. One consultant with a London reputation
who arrived in Sydney without beat of drum less
than two years ago is probably making .£4OOO a
year, and never talks to anybody under two
guineas.

DO YOU SUFFER
from
LIVER COMPLAINT,
INDIGESTION,
CONSTIPATION,
HEARTBURN,
FLATULENCE,
Or any symptoms of a disordered digestive appar-
atus? If so, there is no remedy in the world so
safe and sure to give relief as Fletcher’s Pills and
Clements Tonic. Don’t be misled into wasting
time and money on any of the “ All-failing” nos-
trums so speciously advertised by designing quacks
and dishonest rogues. Remember, these two
remedies have stood the test of time, that their
merits are proved, and that a few shillings in-
vested on them may save you weeks and months
of suffering, and, perhaps, pounds of expense, for
they have done so in hundreds of cases, and we
will send you evidence to prove our assertions on
receipt of your name and address. Remember,
delay is dangerous, and that every hour you
neglect your case the complication increases and a
cure becomes more difficult. Shun the cheap
quack doctors and designing nostrum compounders;
stick to the remedies Clements Tonic and Flet-
cher’s Pills. They are absolutely genuine, and
have proved their efficacy in hundreds of cases'
and will do so every time. They are sold every-
where and made only by F. M. Clements, New-
town, Sydney.
Ed. Bulletin, — To correct a widely-held
wrong impression gathered from your time to
time press reference to Mr. J. H. Geddes’ exploits
in England and the Continent in connection with
the N.S. W. meat and produce- trade, will you, in
justice to the Pastoral Finance Association
Limited (of which I am a member), allow me to
state that all the heavy expenses of Mr. Geddes’
mission were paid by the Association named. In
failing to at any time make reference to the
principals in this laudable undertaking you not
only neglect to “give honor where honor is due,”
but allow the idea to go unchecked, that Mr.
Geddes in this matter acted as an agent for
Geddes, Birt and Co. Ld., and not for the Pas-
toral Finance Association Ld. To prevent any
possible mistakes, let me say that the present
Pastoral Finance Association Ld. (formerly trading
under the title of J. H. Geddes and Co.) is a Co.
quite distinct from the present Geddes, Birt and
Co. Ld.—Yours faithfully, Thos. Hungereoed.

evidently unappreciated responsibilities with the
present apparent shocking condition of that insti-
tution, they should be turned out of office at once.
No official openly accused of causing the death of
a patient by drunken neglect should get “ another
chance ” without establishing his innocence at a
public investigation. The only proper course for
the medical officers, in face of the deliberate insult
conveyed by the committee’s decision to hush up
this hideous scandal, is to resign. This Narandera
hospital affair is the most disgraceful and squalid
scandal which has reached The Bulletin’s ears
for a long while. Unfortunately, however, it is
by no means unique. Within the past 12 months
similar scandals have arisen with regard toother
N.S.W. country hospitals, where unfortunate
patients appear to have died under circumstances
the contemplation of which makes one’s blood run
cold. And in all these cases the ugly business
has been “ hushed up.”

A high New Australia official is said to
have refused medical assistance to some of his
settlers’ wives who were about to become mothers,
on the ground that “natural” mothers ought not
to need a doctor. What difference is there
between the mental condition of such a man and
that of the Sydney clergyman who objected to his
wife wearing stays because “ the mother of Jesus
never wore stays ? ”

Dr. Kennion reports that a new Bishop of

them, they prefer an English nonentity.

In olden times, ’tis said, young ladies
regarded the repetition of the words “prunes,
prisms, and propriety” as the only infallible
recipe for obtaining a “rose-bud mouth.” In
Melbourne, until lately, society youths and
maidens opened their mouths as if' to admit a
whole potato every time they tackled that twang-
test “ cow,” or had occasion to remark “ How very
naice”! Realising recently that the imported
aristocrat, as a rule, dispenses with final g’s, and
meanstersay “ awf’lly rippin’”! whenever con-
venient, they already begin to fling over their
laboriously-acquired “ pure English.”

As The Bulletin predicted, the additional

A current Sydney story says that the body
of an infant was lately found at the gate of a
suburban house, and a verdict of wilful murder
was returned against some person unknown.
There was absolutely nothing to connect any
inmate of the house with the matter; but it is
alleged that an over-zealous constable, learning
that a young lady visitor had recently come down
from the country, jumped to a hasty conclusion
and compelled her to undergo an examination by
the Govt, medical officer, which resulted in her
complete exoneration. It is stated there was no
evidence to justify even the slightest suspicion, and
the shame and annoyance of the lady may be
imagined. If the facts are as stated, they are
worse than disgraceful to the police administra-
tion, and the public are entitled to demand prompt
inquiry and redress.

A Q. daily paper advt. :
"Yy ANTED, Dentist’s “ Show-pieces.” Apply etc.
It is an easy matter to follow those “show-pieces.”
In a week or two they will appear, amidst much
gold paint, in a main street doorway, with the
intimation that Mr. Abraham Bedoodlestein,
D.D.S., late of London and New York, has
commenced operations—“full sets from £l.”
Then Mrs. Mumbles, having decided that
she “ must see about them teeth,” will
take Mr. Mumbles in tow and start out
in search of something cheap. The beautiful
sets in Bedoodlestein’s show-cases settle them ; in
they go, and Mrs, Mumbles has her model taken
(on impression-wax which does duty for all
Bedoodlestein’s “ patients ” —he bought only half-
a-pound to start with), pays a deposit, and waits
anxiously for the time when she can attack a
well-trained bullock. The week following Mrs.
Mumbles calls again, and Bedoodlestein puts into
her mouth a combination of vulcanite and porce-
lain, which feels very uncomfortable, but which
he assures her will be all right “ when the suction
takes.” She waits some time, in much pain and
discomfort, for “the suction to take,” which never
eventuates. After Bedoodlestein has vainly en-
deavored to make the set fit, by warming them
■over a spirit-lamp, and attempting to force them
to the shape of her palate, he says her gums have
shrunk since he took the impression, and wants
15s. to re-model the set. That is all the satisfac-
tion she can get out of him, and Mr. Mumbles,
who is not so keen a searcher after the economic
as his wife is, takes her to a respectable tooth-
artist, who makes Mrs. Mumbles feel ill by point-
ing out to her that the “ set ” is made up of old
teeth, taken from discarded sets which have seen
much service in the mouths of other of Badoodle-
stein’s “ patients.”

Spaguoletti : “ Circumstances have domi-

castes. The woman is a desperate toiler. She
chops the wood, harnesses the horse up in the
dray, takes him out, stables and feeds him and
hauls off the loading, while the husband does
nothing. Hardly Australian, or even English, to
take a lower stand.”

Poor busted Melbourne has a new worry—•
the Bible-fiend. When he knocks at the front-
door the occupant sees a clerical-looking individual
with a black-bag who at once asks, “ Can I speak
with you for a few minutes about the Scripture? ”
She, thinking it a new parson, asks him to step in
and sit down. He does so, opens his bag, and
presently the poor woman finds that she is enter-
taining a canvasser unawares. And, as everybody
knows, Scriptural touts are harder to choke off
than the racecourse article.
Editor Bulletin, — Be your par. (quoted
from G. R. Sims) on Charles Peace and the Man-
chester murder of a policeman in 187fi, for which
an innocent man was sentenced to death. I think
it is not correct to state that the innocent victim
is still raving as a lunatic in Broadmoor. Was
not the innocent victim a man named Habron,
whom the Govt, released on Peace’s confession,
and who returned to Ireland, and received some
small compensation as the result of the matter
being brought before the Commons ?—M.L.

never in Australia. His idea of an Australian is a Bret-
Harteish nondescript who knocks down at a shanty in a
gulch the cheque he has earned by many weary months’
labor at gathering the gum from the gum-trees. This is
the average English writer’s idea of nine Australians in
ten. The tenth is the man who buys the gum
Reca: Better hide those poems in the long grass, any-
where out of the w’ay of the sheep Horace: Have
burnt your monument: wish we could melt your brass
Mendax : Some idea ; but about three limes too long for

M.R. (Riverview): Book not to hand yet.... Rats; Wel-
tering chros, presumably written by a mutton-pie at mid-
night Scadu : Gordon's worst fault is that it’s si easy
for every melancholy ass to paraphrase him Jumbo
Statement (perfectly true) that it’s impossible for an
alleged Australian seaman to keep a wife and family now-
adays would show the clergy (if they had eyes to see) how
low' wages promote what they call “immorality,” and
make every pulpiteer with an ounce of pluck in him an
agitator for better things. But half the clergy are try-
ing to collect their own wages, and the other halt—the old
hands in the fat billets—believe in letting sleeping dogs
lie and not offending wealthy parishioners.... Gozo : Bul-
letin has of late had unfortunate experience re long
letters. You print a man’s letter attacking something
and have, of course, to give the other side space for reply.
The replies and rejoinders grow in length : the kneeling
camel first wriggles his nose into your tent; then come
his head, his neck, his loly; then he stands up and ■
wrecks your home. You mast boil it down. We could
put your (say) 600 lines into 40, but haven’t time. It
takes three times as long to write 40 lines as it does to
write 400.

At Poverty Point .
Geo. Lash Gordon, who died so suddenly in Sydney last
week, was a man of some ability, but bitterly disappointed,
and another round peg in a square hole. He had no little
power as a dramatist, and missed the second or third rung
of the ladder. There is no reason to believe he was much
inferior to such as Brandon Thomas, v*ho hits with a
“Charley's Aunt.”
Melb. people wondered why the nearly-nude figures
were withdrawn from the Princess programme on the
■ occasion of Gov. Hopetoun's farewell visit. As a matter
■of fact. His Ex. wote requesting that the show should
mot be given, so a one-act curtain-raiser was s ibstiluted.
Melba, it is said, won’t allow her promised visit to Aus-
tralia to interfere with her season at Covent Garden
Theatre.
Arthur Garner told Melb. Insolvency Court, the other
.day, that his third share of profits during the last five
years of .the Triumvirate Firm’s existence averaged
£4500 per annum. The Firm’s best year was one of their
■first. As the result of those twelve blissful months they
cutup £30,000 between them, and started to stuff the
■public with theatrical delicacies. The Firth has been
plucky, in a somewhat one-horse country.
Maie Saqui is one of the new Living Pictures at Melb.
Princess’s. “ After the Ball ” represents M.S. sitting up
In bed reading a description of her costume in a morning
paper. Her robe de nuit has no sleeves to it, or perhaps
the damsel went to bed in her ball-dress.
Nearly every Melb. suburb now has its juvenile minstrel
00. who “tour” the environs in vans. You often see
vans driven along the streets, each containing upwards of
20 “ performers ” of from 4 to 16 years old, and of assorted

IT IS EASY TO ASK QUESTIONS.
A child can ask questions that a wise man can’t
answer. Yes ; and there are some questions that
the ablest doctors don’t like to have people ask
ithem. Say a question of this sort —while we are
about it, however, we might as well tell the story
straight away and have done with it.
Mrs. Sarah Mace was very ill with influenza.
■That was in February, 1892, the time of the
■epidemic. The attack was severe. She was
■suddenly seized with a violent pain in the head
((both front and back) and temples. she had pain
in all her joints, too, and was hot and feverish.
She went to bed and sent for the doctor. He came,
examined her, took her temperature—over 100
degrees—and said very little, like a wise man.
The lady could not turn herself in bed. She lived
on slops, such as milk and broth ; she could not
swallow a morsel of solid food. Her husband
pressed hsr to take strong food, saying, “If you
don’t eat you will starve.” Right enough ; but he
forgot that when one can’t eat he can’t eat, and
there’s an end.
Well, she got weaker and weaker, and fell away
until there wasn’t much left of her but skin and
bone. Then, in her anxiety, she put her question ;
“ Doctor, do you think I shall get well ?"
The doctor’s answer was true and honest; we
like and respect him for it. He said, “ Mrs. Mace,
Ido not know." He couldn’t tell. Neither could
any other doctor. No ; not even if he had a string
of titles to his name as long as a kite’s tail. But
did she get well? Wait a bit. We must hark
back a minute now.
Along about the 10th of March, 1880, Mrs. Mace
(began to feel tired, languid and weary, as if her
■work was too much for her, she said. She had a
ibad taste in the mouth, poor appetite, and what-
ever she ate gave her pain at the chest and heart.
-“I had,” she continues, “a dull heavy pain at the
■right side and between the shoulders, and a sinking
•■feeling at the pit of the stomach, and a rising of
ifoul gas in my throat. Later on I had rheumatic
ipains in my heart, chest and back. I sent for a
■doctor, who attended me for six weeks, but I got
worse. One day the cook said, ‘ Why don’t you
try Mother Seigel’s Curative Syrup?’—this being
a medicine my mistress (I was living with a lady
in Camden Town) kept in the house for family use.
I did so, and was soon as strong as ever.
Years fled away, and in 1891 she had the first
attack of influenza, and in 1892, the second, al-
ready described in part. We now complete the
account of the 1892 attack.
Mrs. Mace says: “The doctor continued to
attend me for five weeks, and I took his medicines
for that time, but gained no strength. After hav-
ing suffered for seven weeks I said to my husband,
* I will now see what Mother Seigel’s Curative
Syrup will do for me. Perhaps it may cure
influenza as well as other ailments.’ I carried out
this resolution ; began taking the Syrup, and was
soon on my feet again, and have since kept in
excellent health, taking an occasional dose when
needed. (Signed) Sakah Mace, Monk’s Farm,
Great Warley, Brentwood, Essex, August 27th,
1892.” •
Now we have never advertised Mother Seigel’s
■Curative Syrup as a remedy for influenza. Yet
the facts stated by Mrs. Mace cannot be disputed.
What is the conclusion ? A very simple one in-
deed. She did not have influenza until her system
Iliad lietui debilitated by indigestion and dyspepsia.
It is such people generally (almost wholly) that
all epidemic diseases attack. The dreaded cholera
scarcely ever touches anybody except a dyspeptic
—cholera is a malady of the bowels only. The
•more we hear of disease the more the proof piles
mp, showing that persons with a sound digestion
■art safe against dying of anything except violence
or old age. The gyrup cured Mrs. Maca’s influenza
by taking away the ground it stood on —the tor-
pidity of her digestion.
She once asked, “ Doctor, do you think I shall
get well?” Time and Mother Seigel have said,
“Yes.”

comedy,” ‘‘The Importance of Being Earnest:”—“ln

pure, and never simple.” “It is always painful to part
from people whom one has known for a very brief space
of time.” “No married man is ever attractive, except to

possible disappointment, I think it only fair to tell you
quite frankly beforehand that I am fully determined to

“A distinguishing feature of a successful Melb. variety
show is the number of female ‘ solicitors ’ encountered in
the d.c.,” writes a correspondent. One male habitub had
no less than five demi monda'ni addresses sent round to
hinf on a recent Saturday.” Perhaps so—but he must
have been looking for them. No man without a bold, bad
eye is ever the object of such attention.
A well-known actress in Vienna is said to have been
dismissed from the company because she wouldn’t allow
her stage-lovers, or even her stage-fathers, to kiss her.
Reason : she had only lately been married, and her real
husband was jealous. Poor devil ! He goes to the
theatre every night and watches his wife carefully.
Sooner or later something will happen to take him off
guard, and the belief that his w ife was devoured with
kisses on that particular evening will grow on him until
he goes mad, or takes to drink. They generally take to
drink and whack their idols.
Dear Bulletin, —John Lemmone’s London success is
not surprising. Instrumentalists who have heard the best
of the European flautists, and those who have heard Rad-
clifle, Schadb, and other cracks in Australia, have, ail
along, been unanimously of opinion that Lemmone could
hold his own anywhere. Radcliffe produces some start-
ling effects, and his execution is phenomenal; but the
Australian has a certain native delicacy of style, combined
with fine execution, in which he is unrivalled. As a com-
poser he will also take high rank. His “ Polka Caprice ”
is unique, and his more ambitious compositions should
acquire a wide popularity. Strange as it may appear,
envy plays no part in the feelings which Australian
flautists bear towards “Jack” Lemmone. Never was
there a more modest or popular star, and all flute-land
rejoices to hear of his success—a success all the more
deserved when is taken into consideration the comparative
lack of opportunity which instrumentalists, away from
the great musical centres, have of perfecting themselves.
With Lemmone out of the way, there should be a good
opening in Australia for amateur Moss, of Dunedin (M.L.).
He is quite young, still improving, and is already a very
superior performer—at his best in the classics of Kuhlau.
But Moss is of the Chosen ; and, preferring the certain
emoluments of a good commercial traveller’s situation to
the uncertainty of artistic life, has refused several tempt-
ing offers.— Flauto Magico.
Miss Marie Elster’s benefit, coming off at Melb. Theatre
Royal 9th April, promises to be a real success. All the
magnates (social, judicial, parliamentary and otherwise)
are disposed to recognise the merits of the good-looking
songstress now that she is going away. “Ohoufleuri”
complete, garden-scene from “Faust,” and first act of
“ Maritana,” are the chief items of the programme. Miss
Elster’s place is on the stage, but she is going first under
Marohesi —as this seems to be the required thing since
Melba’s success. Sir W. Robinson has written that
he has letters of introduction ready for her, and that he
is going to compose her a. song himself when the right
mood comes on. Miss Elster has done her quota for
charily, and for this she ought to be rememb red in her
own hour of want of funds. Miss Elster’s stage-name is
taken, like Mde. Melba’s, from the place of her residence.
When she first fnade singing her profession she lived at
Elsternwick.
“Bob” Cunningham, the Melb. tenor, now on his way
back from London with a concert co., achieved a great
success in the Big Smoke, where he sang on the same
platform with Santley, Foli, Ben Davies, Sterling and
Alice Gomez.
Dear Bulletin,— Grundy, in writing “ A Bunch of
Violets,” recently produced at Melb. Bijou, must ha\e
been greatly influenced by Mrs. Grundy. He is at no
little pains to caricature offensively the working man in
politics. Few dramatists will allow the working man to
meddle in politics without making an ass of him, and
Grundy makes him more of an ass than usual, and a good
deal of the hog into the bargain. A deputation of work-
ing men introduced is too grossly ridiculous, even for
Tory-supported burlesque. Every man of the party is a
bottle-nosed, frowsy, crapulous dead-beat, who bellows
insane appl iuse at the most transparent bunkum and
palpable “borack” spoken by the pious candidate. Their
leader is an unconscionable German, a gaol-bird and a
disgusting sneak, who sells the working men’s vote in the
lump. Grundy allow'S some good points to his rascally
Baronet, hypocrite, embezzler, bigamist, and thief, but
does not condescend to relieve with even a faint suggestion
of common-sense the gluttony, drunkenness and dirt of
the working man who presumes to be political. One quiet,
sensible toiler, who had washed himself, and who was
perfectly sober, and had decent patches on his pants, and
wasn’t prepared to sell his soul for 18d., might have im-
proved the odour of “The Bunch of Violets ” vastly, but
Grundy couldn’t place him. Strange that the British
workman, who is so well washed and combed whilst he
confines himself to the temperance movement and Bible-
classes, should run to rags, and beer, and dirt, and im-
morality immediately he touches politics.—E.D.

SPORTING NOTIONS.
The Vio.-English cricket-match was an anti-
climax in which neither players nor public took much
interest. Stoddart stood out on account of his cold, and
the Englishmen’s first innings only readied 131. Vic.
followed with 269; England made 270; and Vi a got the
133 required to win with 7 wickets and 3 runs to spare.
♦ * * •
In the match England v. Victoria the manage-
ment pouched shekels they would otherwise have lost hy
admitting spectators to the ground for 6d. after 3.30. The
innovation is a good one.
* * • ♦
The Englishmen’s performance against Victoria
was discreditable, but quite natural under the circum-
stances. They batted anyhow, and fi Ided, in many
instances, as though the few’ people present hadn t paid
for a serious show.
• • » »
The speeches of the amateur rnemoers of Stod-
dart’s team at the farewell Melb. Club banquet were per-
fect models of the dude style of talk, doncherknow.
Stoddart informed the company six distinct thin s that he
had “an awfully jolly trip.” Wicket-keeper Phillipson
said lie was “devilish glad” he had come, and the long
Ford said he would have been “deucedly sowy ” if he
hadn’t, whilst Lancashire Maclaren remarked that he
would be “awfully delighted” to come again. Briggs
merely stated that, he had had a jolly good time, and
wanted another trip of the same kind.
• • * •
The Melb. Cricket-club goes out of its way to
perpetuate and accentuate the snobbish English practice
of distinguishing between “amateurs” and “profes-
sionals.” At all the luncheons the Misters have occupied
the top table and the pro.’s have been stowed among the
crowd. This was the case at the farewell banquet, but
the assembled eaters showed their contempt for this pro-
ceeding by yelling for Maclaren. Ford and Co. exactly as
they shouted for plain Johnny Briggs. Another odious
feature of the M.C.C.’s snobbishness in this direction was
the giving of honorary life-membership medals to the
“gentleman players” only.

Judge A’Beckett, at the Stoddart banquet, con-
fessed, amidst much merriment, that during the final
test-match the Supreme Court Judges got frequent
bulletins of the game gravely handed up to them by
counsel in the guise of “ notes in the case.”

Dear Bulletin, —Joy is but the foretaste of
sorrow. Pleasure is the sugar coating on the pill of
despair. Surely, too surely, i predicted disaster for Aus-
tralia as a necessary consequence of the cable-stoppage
that for eight mad days protected us from European
news. The cable-liar was gagged as no Gould could gag
him. For a joyous week London Times did not approve
the opinion of the Argus or the S.M. Herald with regard
to frozen meat. For a week the death of no second sons
of second-rate nonentities was wired to Australia.
Every omen said disaster. The disaster came in the fifth
test-match. For me, I forestalled my fate. I had dis-
ciplined my soul into calm with the pantomimes—while
the continent mourned I was at peace. I had conquered
the worst. —Y.Z.

Blackliam greatly admires Johns, the Melb.
University stumper, who kept wickets against England
last week, and regards him as ills legitimate successor
in the Vic. team, if not in Australia. The pad-and-
glove men are cropping up in every province. Vic. lias
Blackliam, Johns and Lewis; N.S.W, Kelly; and S.A.,
Clem. Hill and Jarvis, all first-rate men.

There is not much doubt now that an Australian
team will leave for Hingland in a year’s time. The popu-
lar “ Jack ” Portua w-as suggested as manager, but his
recent Govt, appointment will perhaps forbid. Phil. Sheri-
dan may undertake the job. Unless a great reversal of
form takes place next season, five new men, at least, will
be in the team, viz., Eady (Tas.), Albert Trolt (Vic.), Ire-
dale (N.S.W.), and Darling and Clem. Hill. Young Hill
will be taken as second stumper.

Of the players representing Australia now,
Giffen and B ackhiam are the only ones who were in the
memorable match in Aug., ’B2, when Australia beat Eng-
land by 7 runs.

Jack Lyons, playing in a club-match, March 16,
made 70 out of 80 runs scored on a bad wicket w-hile he
was in. The ball went oat of the ground twice, and five
times over the chains. On the same day Jones, the
“ Adelaide Express,” bowled 8 wickets for 23 runs.

A popular curate is stationed in a township in

crack team. He is much liked by ail creeds and classes,
and if the youthful portion of his flock could manage it
he would be immediately created a Church, of England

once his but for the fact that acceptance would involve
his removal from the district.

is estimated that when “Old Jack f ’ is open to breeders
lie will soon get back the £13,650 which he cost, as a run

Net a single favorite got home at the Hopetoun
complimentary meeting.
‘ * * * *
The Hopetoun Farewell meeting at Flemington
was another awful experici-e for punters. When the
average starting price of winners is 9 to X the unf >r-
tunates who back a loser every lime are in an overwhelm-
ing majority, under which circumstance the fact that an
earl happens to lie making his last appearance on the
scene of desolation doesn't count for much. As a special
occasion for horsey grovel, last Saturday’s meeting proved
a failure. Not more than fifty loyalists, old V.U.O,
identities for the most part, demonstrated over Gov.
Hopetoun’s departure after the fifth race had fallen
to n rank outsider, and of these not more than
ten joined in the “one cheer more for the Countess."
Her ladyship certainly didn’t poll a dozen shouts. A few
female leaders of sassiety came down to ttie rails beside
the judge’s box, with the avowed hope of hearing a greet
ovation, or something, but the ovation or something never
came to pass. The people who had been expected to roll
up and make a noise in Hopetoun’s honor were going
their respective ways, cursing their blanky luck.
Lady Hopetoun, sporting the familiar cheeked
gown, with magenta fixings* which lias served tier many
tini 'S and oft. at the races, made a farewell tour of
Fh niington birdcage while the steeplechasers were being
saddled. On the subject of hors s she can be almost
eloq lent, and in birdcage society ttie fair descendant of
Mullins gets a'.ong comfortably. Bnsaco was the
pnticular animal that Lady Hopetoun had come
f rib for to see, and old Alec. Tav lor, of
lit I Inrat, was just girthing the favourite when she
a rived. Rather an alf ding spectacle, that parting
interview h tween Ali o and Ins nohl ■ friend. She
held the old ’mi’s band (of which sporting journalists fre--
qnentiy remark that it “has not yet. lest its cunning ’’) as
though loth to leave him, and perhaps there was a tear in
tier Irish eye when she turned to go. Evidently Alec and
the Countess had met in ttie Ballarat district, and one
touch of horse had made them kin.

who have received great benefit from Clements
Tonic, I feel grateful and in duty bound to con-
vey to you in writing my gratitude for blessings
received. I have been troubled for some time
with violent coughing and spitting first thing in
the morning, back-aching, tired and aching limbs
all over, head-ache and dizziness so that I would
reel and fall if I did not happen to be near some-
thing to hold on to with my hands. I tried many
things, but found very little relief until one day
hearing of Clements Tonic I felt anxious to try it,
and after taking two bottles I not only found re-
lief but have much pleasure in testifying to a
thorough cure, and with confidence recommend all
like sufferers to faithfully try Clements Tonic,
believing it will do them good.—Yours respect-

SKIN DISEASE
CURED BY
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla
Mr. Geo. W. Burtner, Keezletown, Ya.,
writes, as follows;
“ Shortly after leaving college, I was troubled
with a skin disease which showed itself, first, at
the ankles. Physicians pronounced it eczema,
and treated me for that complaint. The erup-
tion crept slowly up my limbs, and on the body,
until it enveloped the whole frame. It gave me
infinite trouble with constant itching, casting off
of dry scales, and a watery liquid which would
ii
96
exude from under the scales. I treated it for
over three years unsuccessfully, and was unable
to check it, until I began using Ayer’s Sarsapa-
rilla. I used three bottles of this medicine and
was completely cured —my skin becoming as
smooth and clear as before.”

“A man who comes to be hanged has the

How people may disappear in the bush.
In the ’9O flood a lot of blacks were camped near
Gunyan, on the Dumaresq, and one, old Nanny,
aged about 80 or 90, was swept away. In ’95 the
remains of Nanny were found not very far off in
a heap of flood debris which had been set on fire.
It was quite close to a racecourse, where races
have been held every year since, yet old Nanny
quietly reposed th re all the time. Since then the
bones have been distributed as curios.
Whoever reverences things that are old,
including ruins, and mummies, and the legends ■ f
the Rhine, and the Church, and the institution ■ f
monarchy, should use Elixir dentifrice, for width
Metayer and Co., of 8 O’Connell-street, Sydney,
are wholesale agents. It was invented by a holy
Benedictine father, of the French Abbey of Sonlac,
just 522 years ago, and has commanded a good sale
ever since. It was the first dentifrice used in the
dark and dirty middle ages, and its long continuance
may be set down as reliable proof of its excellence.
Also, the Benedictine fathers had a fine taste in
scents and perfumes, and all manner of luxuries,
and what they did for their own comfort was
always done well. Therefore, it may be safely
assumed that the old father of 1373 turned out a
valuable article.
Victoria's most persistent litigant, now
that Silas Hard ng is no more, is a man who three
years ago had a small grievance about a culvert.
He sued the shire council over it three times in
various courts, and at last got a verdict with costs.
Then he was found going round with a gun after
seme of the witnesses on the other side, and was
committed for trial by the local injustices. The
Crown didn’t proceed with the case, and the
aggravated plaintiff next applied for and obtained
an order with costs to quash the decision of the
local court in committing him for trial. Then the
Crown got another Judge to quash the order to
quash the decision of the local court with costs.
After that, plaintiff applied to the Full Court to
quash this last order, but his appeal was dis-
missed witli costs, so lie will now probably take
his famous case to the I’rivy Council. Which all
goes to show how six or eight lawyers can get a
g i >d living for three years out of a very ordinary
culvert.
It has long been recognised that tobacco is
an invaluable disinfectant and purifier, as well as
an unfailing agent in the destruction of all para-
sitic insect life. From this proposition depends
the great reputation of the Excelsior Nicotine
Sheep-dip, whose chief constituents are nicotine
and carbolic, and Mr. Blackett, the Vic. Govt,
analyst, says : The value of the tobacco-dip
depends on the quantity of nicotine, its solubility
in water, and on its retaining its principles un-
changed in solution. The Excelsior Nicotine Dip
possesses all three qualities, and is recommended
to all sheep-owners as an effective preventative
and cure of scab, ticks, lice, acari, &c. Messrs.

SWORN TESTIMONY. STATUTORY DECLARATION.
I, THOS. MUDIMAN, Master Tailor, of 547 George-street, Sydney, in the Colony of
New South Wales, do hereby solemnly and sincerely declare as follows :
Whereas I suffered severely from a very troub’esome affection of the Nerves, which
affected me so much that I was quite unable to attend to my business. I tried several doctors
and many remedies, but all of no avail. Whereas I, as a last hope, obtained some of Herr
Rassmussen’s Purely Herbal “Alfaline
Vitality Pills,” which I hereby solemnly and
sincerely declare Completely Cured Me with-
in a few weeks, and although this is over five
years ago I have remained well ever since.
The Alfaline Pills also cured my wife, and
I make this solemn declaration conscientiously
believing the same to be true.

Fac-simile of Cheque for £2500, received for part of Victorian
rights in No, 1 Patent Investment—First Dividend on Original
Subscription of £5OO.
Profits on Patents. —“ More money has been, and always oan be, made out of patented in-
ventions than by any other investments.”
Essentials to Success ■with Patents. —(1.) A good and novel invention. (2.) Capital to
protect and develop the invention THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. (3.) Experience in appraising
the intrinsic merits of an invention, its prospects of success, and, after securing protection, in deve-
loping and introducing it on the world’s markets—in short, Business Management.
Good inventions on the one hand, capital on the other, are comparatively plentiful. THE AUS-
TRALIAN PATENTS DEVELOPMENT COMPANY is projected to provide the third equally
important essential, business management.
The success attending the privately conducted PATENT INVESTMENTS Nos. 1 and 2, and
the numerous flattering applications from inventors and investors alike, convince the management
that there is room for the extension of its operations over a much wider field than was at first contem-
plated.
The Company’s modus operandi is as follows: Selecting the first essential, viz., “a good and
novel invention,” from amongst the many offered for approval, the Company invites subscriptions
to a development fund—in this case of .£lOOO in 1000 shares of £1 each. This provides the second
essentia], “ Capital to develop and protect the invention.”
The business relations established throughout the world in dealing with their other valuable
patents, and the experience of the Company’s officers and experts afford the third essential, “ Business
Management.” ' •
The Management can confidently recommend their No. 3 Investment to subscribers as a thoroughly
safe speculation, and one certain to bring in very handsome returns. It is anticipated that the sales
of patent rights and licenses to manufacture the invention selected (which is an article of everyday use
in every household) will produce a nett return of from one to three million pounds sterling, and that
it will commence to pay handsomely immediately the patents are fully secured, giving a dividend
exceeding the original subscription within six months.
The invention is perfected, and patents are being secured in every part of the world. The funds
subscribed are used exclusively for this purpose. No part of the fund goes to inventor until nett
profits are declared, of which he takes one-third.
No. 3 Investment Closes with
1000 SUBSCRIBERS
At <£l Each.
Subscriptions registered in order of receipt.
Subscription Certificates for each £ subscribed,
numbered (from 1 to 1000) in same order as
registered, forwarded by return post.
Subscriptions received in excess of £lOOO on
No. 3 will be registered on No. 4, the terms of
which will be similar to No. 3, or such subsequent
investment on similar terms as they may lie in
time for, unless otherwise directed by subscriber.
One-third of nett profits on Sales of Patent
Rights and Licenses to manufacture on Royalty
THROUGHOUT THE WORLD, are divided
amongst subscribers at intervals not exceeding
Six Months.

EXTRACTS
FROM
PRIVATE LETTERS.
“It is with heartfelt grati-
tude I write to tell you of the
great benefit my little daugh-
ter Gladys has derived from
‘Benger's Food.' The doctor
and all who saw her thought
we should never he able to
rear her. We took her to the
hospital, and the authori-
ties recommended ‘ Beuger's
Food.’ From that time she
began to pick up flesh and
strength.”
“If every mother knew of
Its value no other would bo
used.”

Dear Bulletin, —An Australian country
hospital is a queer place. A while ago I was
trained nurse in one, which was favoured with two
physicians —Dr. X. and Dr. Z. Dr. X. was
seized with a mania for experimenting. He
grappled with the “ ” life-elixir
theory, and decided to test the vile fluid on his
own account in the benevolent ward. He took
the superintendent into his confidence and in-
structed him to tell me the injections consisted
of morphia. The sup. disobeyed his orders
and told me the truth, so I was able to
make private notes of all the cases. Dr. X.
had three beds in the benevolent ward. ( Dr.
Z. had one. Dr. X., who, as usual, wasn’t on
speaking terms with his colleague, had paved
the way to success by assuring his three
old geysers—whose ages ranged from 74 to 89
—that in a week’s time they would feel
twenty years younger. He went through all
sorts of manoeuvres to get me out of the ward
while he raved to them about the new treatment.
His precautions were wasted, as the senile and
loquacious patients invariably babbled to me all
about the cure which was to work sueh miracles.
The first patient to be treated was “Old Ned.”
He was an asthmaticky-rheumaticky subject, very
limp and helpless ; but he had his good days, and
he happened to have a good spell just at the time
of the first injection of the life-giving liquid.
This, combined with his faith in the new cure,
gave him unwonted vigor; he walked with an
almost straight back, and opened and shut his
gnarled fingers with marvellous rapidity. Dr. X.
was elated with his apparent success—so much so
that he told his friends, and by some means it
reached the ears of the local pressman, who
(doubtless, satirically) telegraphed the startling
news to the metropolitan dailies. Local excite-
ment ran high, and Dr. Z, asked meif I knew
anything of the matter. I told him all. To my
surprise, instead of joining me in my scepticism,
he seemed much impressed, and the next day said
he meant to try the thing for himself ! Dr. X.,
meanwhile, had treated the other two benevolents,
and they also improved hourly. Dr. Z.’s patient
felt neglected, and loudly demanded tobesupplied
with “ some o’ that ’ere stuff! ” Dr. Z. graciously
said: “So you shall be.” He took a little
bottle of whitish fluid out of his pocket, half-
filled a hypodermic syringe, and injected it
into the old man’s leg. Then he left the
ward, saying, “Now, you must not move
before daylight!” This seemed to me a queer
remark, but I guessed it had been made with
a purpose. This patient, known as “Mickey,”
was partially paralysed, and could not walk
without crutches—and then his toes hung straight
down from his heels and dragged on the floor. I
was on duty that night, staying up with a bad
fever case, and when I went into the old men’s
ward at dawn, the next day, I was just in time
to see “ Mickey ” walking from his bed to the
mantelpiece, to which he held very tightly and
surveyed my astonished face in triumph. “That
there stuff’s put the power back agin in my legs,”
he said ; and for two days it seemed the truth ;
but he collapsed on the third, and ever after was
lamer than ever. Two of Dr. X.’s rejuvenated
patients died from blood-poisoning, and the third
very nearly died. Dr. X. didn t advertise the
final result of his experiments, and the whole
thing was carefully hushed up. I left the hospital
soon after, and when I paid Dr. Z. a farewell
call, I showed him my notes of the Brown-Sequard
cases, “Scandalous,” he murmured, “as if the
subcutaneous injection of organic matter could
give an old person new life !” I said, quietly,
“You used milk-and-water, did you not?” He
replied, “You are not far wrong, nurse, but I
had an undoubted ‘result ’ for two days !’’ As I
remarked, an Australian country hospital is often
a queer place—and God help the patients !■

Conducted by Mr. George Adams (Tattersall’s).
TN placing this property before the public, Mr. Adams desires to say that no more hona
fide venture has ever been offered. Mr. W. R. Wilson has most reluctantly agreed to
submit it, owing to his time being entirely occupied with his other pursuits. In the history
of Australia no one has more consistently bought the best of everything, regardless of cost;
and his well-known and justly-deserved character for fair dealing is sufficient to dispel any
doubt as to the figures submitted, or the descriptions given of the various prizes.
As it is confidently expected the whole amount will be readily subscribed, early appli-
cation is necessary. ' .
All overflow money received will be placed in the £lOO,OOO Consultation on next
Melbourne Cnp, so that those outside the colonies need not hesitate about remitting in the
usual way. Ihe Distribution will be drawn under Mr. Adams’ personal supervision, and
in the presence of any subscribers and the public, at Brisbane, Queensland, as soon as it is
tilled. ‘ :

I he late C. B. Lowe’s (N.S.W.) book on horse-
breeding is at present hung up. When the poor fellow
died, writes Tub Bulletin’s London correspondent, he
left Allison, the “ Special Commissioner” of London
Sportsman, himself a recognised authority on breed-
ing, as his literary executor. Mr. H. C. White, with his
customary liberality, had given Lowe £3OO for the pur-
pose of bringing out the work, and this sum remains locked
up in a bank in London and will not be paid out until
Lowe’s estate is administered in England. By the
way, why has Mr. J. A. Scarr never published in book-
form liis clever articles on horse-breeding which appeared
i i old Bell’s Life in Sydney many years ago under the
signature of “ Puhdit ? ”
* * * *
Mr. W. C. Cooper, more or less of N.S.W.,
is not an absolute business genius, and was lately
hoist with his own petard. He owned the smart
colt Kirkeonnel, a second Derby favorite. Find-
ing, or thinking (and he may be wrong) that the horse
h el no chance of beating Raconteur, he determined to
sell him. He had insured him for a large sum, the
premium being £3OO a year, hut when he sold the horse
lie did not mention this fact! Had he done so the colt
would have- fetched considerably more than the 5000
guineas Blundell Maple gave for him. Cooper, however,
preferred to k -ep -.the insurance himself, intending to
claim in the event of the colt’s death. Maple heard of it,
and offered- £2OO for the policy, which had run for some
time, but Cooper wanted the whole premium he had
paid. Accordingly, he kept the policy—to discover when
too late that having parted with the animal ho had no
insurable interest, and that Lloyds would not pay if it
died,
♦ ♦ * *
The Y.R.C. is being asked to reduce the mini-
mum of stakes at suburban meetings to £2OO. Which
recalls a story about the veteran Bradshaw. “Old Brad”
had laid out a course (Richfield) near Mordialloc, which,
although within the suburban radius, was four miles from
the railway station ; consequently, £4OO stakes were out
of the question. But “ Braddy ” was equal to the occa-
sion. He put a race on the programme which he called
the Yellowhammer Stakes, value £2OO, open to the pro-
geny of Yellowhammer, As Yellowhammer had never
sireil more thart three quadrupeds in his life, and one was
dead, and the otlmr two in Brad’s own possession, a most
interesting race was looked for. They had both been
superannuated and had not been clipped for years. But
they were trott d out to race, and, after falling down a
couple of tim ‘s', managed to pass the winning-post, thus
saving “ Braddy ” the £2OO.

A certain good all-round Australian-born Syd-
ney sportsman, of old-time rowing and sailing celebrity,
now riiles a p>lo pony with a hanged tai l . In the old days,
he used to lie rioted for the courage of his opinions,
but time and the durned Britisher must havealtered him,
as the writer can scarcely believe that any Australian
lover of horseflesh can regard a banged tail as suitable for
wisping off Australian flies.

A Tasmanian tiglit-place vouched for by an old
fisherman. He was out off,shore, single-handed, “jig-
ging ” for barracouta. For a time he was very unsuc-
cessful-then fish came with a rush, fast and furious, and
he was lifting them out of the water as fast as he could
use the jig. At last the fish who were not hooked, noting
the upward flight of their brethren, thought there was •
something extra good “on the board” above water, and
they started “breaching’’—jumping into the boat from
all sides, chasing each other like a flock of sh ep,
while the Lone Fisherman chuckled with delight
at the grand freight he was getting so easily.
Presently, however, the matter became serious,
for the boat was getting far too deep for safety. Still
the fish came, and the captain and crew turned his atten-
tion to lightening cargo, and began throwing them out
as fast as he could, till the air was thick with fish going
and coming. He was utterly exhausted when the ’couta
ceased run dng, and as soon as he could pull himself
together he made for shore and safety. To this day he
declares that he never worked harder than when fighting
the plague of fishes to keep his boat afloat-and that he
will never in all his life again go jigging barracouta
single-handed. [The Bulletin how calls upon the Sydney
Society of Fish Liars to show its best card.]

The late Duchess of Montrose was a daughter of
Lord Decies. His lovely sister married Hope, the mil-
lionaire novelist, an ugly man, author of “Anastasius.”
An artist painted the couple together. Hope wasn’t satis-
fied, and returned the picture. The artist changed his
head to a baboon, and exhibited the pair as Beauty and
the Beast. Denies cut the picture to ribbons. Artist
sued him. Case dismissed,

Years ago very heavy play was indulged in on
the Australian coasting-steamers, and one captain (who
died not long ago) was noted for his luck. But he worked
on a system. Whenever a bad run set in,.his steward
somehow always came along with—“ The chief-officer
wants you on deck, sir,” and enabled him to retire with
at least some of his winnings. The signal was a clever
one, and was never spotted.

Jobson had driven in his fast blood mare,
Molly, and was standing outside the Royal when the local
medico approaching asked Jobson his price for her. With
extreme gravity the latter replied, “Ten notes.” The
doctor, with much deliberation, felt her all over, thought
hard, and at length said, “ I’ll take her if I can sell one of
my own horses.” Jobson, unwilling to lose so good a
deal, persuaded the doctor to buy her, with the result
that the bargain was clinched on the spot, and those
assembled adjourned for drinks at the doctor’s expense.
As the transaction was a cash one, the doctor, after some
difficulty, due more to the stonebrokeness of his friends
than any other cause, borrowed the amount and handed
it over. “ What are these ?” said Jobson. “ Why, £XQ—
the sum you named,” replied the doctor. “Oh,” re-
marked Jobson with a quiet smile, “ my price was ten
notes—ten £5O notes.” Jobson and the doctor are not
cousins now.

Cohuna (Vic.) Trust ranks easily first for
meanness among many mean local authorities.
The trust advertised the other (lay for a secretary
(who has also to collect the rates). The last secre-
tary received <£lso per annum, which the job- is
honestly worth. The applicants asked from <£ls6

the condition that if he applied for an advance in
salary he would be dismissed!” The Bulletin
will watch with interest the career of this for-,
tunate wretch.
A reclaimed sinner advertises at great
length in a M.L, paper about his own past
iniquities. A few extracts
I, , hereby apologise for having slandered Messrs.
and , and all others, many in numbers. . . ,
That on several occasions I was guilty of searching the
pockets of coats belonging to some of the employes of that
firm with a view to stealing therefrom. . . . That
some years ago, on one, if not on more than one, occasion,
1 meanly stole some effervescing drink whilst the owners
of the shop were not present. . . . That about ten
years ago, when a hoarder and lodger at
, —, -, I stole half-a-orown (I
think this was the amount) from a vest pocket while
the owner lay asleep in bed. That on several occasions I
wilfully broke some of the by-laws of the city.
That I picked flowers in gardens (private) without asking
the owners’ permission to do so. That the expenses for
the supper and dance I gave at - a few years ago were
entirely defrayed from money out of which I had swindled
Messrs. and . That ray dealings when I sold fish
at, were not always strictly honest. I herewith beg
the pardon of all I have deceived and wronged in a,ny
way.
There is an itinerant evangelist in these parts at
present, and the dishonest fish-man has evidently
been “awakened.” By-and-bye, when the evan-
gelist is gone and the awakening is over, he will
be the maddest fish-man in Maoriland every time
he thinks of how he gave himself away. Whem a
man advertises that he is dishonest the public
always believes him enthusiastically. When he
further advertises that he isn’t going to be dis-
honest any more, the public only grins.
A budding .Mtilb. iuillior sent a story to
ascertain infinential local editor, and, to satisfy
himself as to whether itJ s had b'den read, he rolled
it up, placed a lively blow fly inside, and stopped
both, .ends. fo After many .days along .came the
rejected MSS. with the usual ‘ ‘ uns.uitable ’ note.
On opening the bundle out tell the corpse of the
fly—evidence of the “careful consideration.” -The
author has been growling—but he ought to have
been glad to get his fly back. L
A relic of an ancient tragedy was dis-
covered the other day near Havelock (M.L.). At
the foot of a cliff somebody chanced on the skele-
ton of a man. The head #as gone, and' both legs
were broken ; also, the clothes and flesh- ffmff
entirely rotted awayl A few lines had bcm
scratched on the rock with a Jknife.i.but thepuly
thing which could be*, discovered was |bc date’
“ 1850.” Apparently the owner of the relics had
dropped over the rocks 45 years ago, and had f bCbii'
waiting ever since for someone to come along and!
find him. No one can trace his identity, so his*
epitaph will simply read ; ‘’Some Bones. Djedl
1850,” ' ;
Gem from biography of Burns, one of Mie>

A Step Too High,
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Te Parehao was a Maori chief, and Te
Parehao had something on his mind. He made no
sign, and worked away with spade and spear among
the gum-diggers as if his thoughts were as tranquil
as usual. Toward afternoon, though, when chance
threw him alone with Herewini, the oldest, and
therefore the most respected chief in Taiere, he
made known his trouble quietly, and asked
advice.
Herewini was grieved beyond measure when he
heard ; but he alone could not give counsel in a
case like this, he must consult the other rangatiras
of the settlement.
The meeting took place at dusk in Herewini’s
own whari. Five chiefs, all of high rank, were
present. They sat silently round a fire in the
middle of the floor, spitting into the coals. Te
Parehao, the sixth chief, and the one chiefly
interested, was late in arriving; but he came at
last and squatted quietly by the fire. Then
Herewini’s voice called on him to make known
the cause of this meeting; and the listeners moved
from the fire a little, and regarded Te Parehao
expectantly.
He introduced himself warrior fashion, then
reminded them that he had been husband four
months to a woman who was very pleasing to the
eye; that she only went away yesterday to see
her friends, who lived some two miles past the
pakeha’s house; and that it was a moonlight night
last night. Very well. He felt solitary, and
went out. He walked, he walked a long way,
and at last the home of the only white man in
Taiere was before his eyes. Then was he coming
back, but he saw through the trees a man and
woman going along to the house. Ah ! these
chiefs of high blood before him would feel sick
with shame, for the woman was her to whom he
had been married four months : the man was that
pu-rurry pakeha 1 Well, they went in, and he
waited and waited ; and the moon had gone
down, and it was near the rising of the sun when
the woman came out of the house and went back
to the home of her friends, two miles away. That
was all his korero, and he would ask the wise men
present what was to be done.
An old chief cleared his throat and spat impres-
sively into the fire. He had a few observations
to make. In the first place, the white man’s
punishment should be great, because he expected
too much. Not only did they allow him two
girls to keep house and wash, but he frequently
came and spent hours in the society of other
women, and wrong was not thought of it. And
now— a chief’s wife!—that was a step too high.
Those were all his words.
The next gentleman agreed with all his learned
friend had said. He suggested a form of punish-
ment which, under similar circumstances, has
suggested itself to men of many nations, and
waited. An older chief did not think the mode
severe enough. What did the others think?
They left it in the hands of the chief whose honor
had been injured. Would Te Parehao speak?
Yes ; he wanted the life of the white man and
his mistress that night. As for the kind of
punishment proposed—no, Te Parehao would
eooner butcher the white man outright. Plenty
of supplejacks he would take to lash the two
together ; and he wanted help to drag them to the
coast. The sea was big—the sea might wash out
their stain. First he would go to the house of
the white man, and tie him up; then away to
where the woman was, and ask her to come home.
The rest would be easy. Who would help him ?
Two of the strongest offered their services at
once.
« » •
It was moonlight, and nine o’clock ; and
the premises of Joseph Mackerrow, storekeeper,
had been closed for two or three hours. The
owner himself had been out in the moonlight half-
an-hour ago, but he had gone in, and now there
was no lights in the place. No lights, and no one
about.
Hush ! Was not that a woman who walked
quickly up in the pale moonlight toward the door,
and opened it, and went in? And what of three
figures that lay in the shadow of a clump of
blackish-trunked manuka trees huddled together
near the house ? It was hard to see them, no
matter how you peered.
It must have been half-an-hour after the woman
went in when these figures got up and approached
the door noiselessly. It was unlocked, and in
they went without a sound, each carrying a bundle
of split supplejacks.
Then everything was inanimate again.
Time passed. The place was now in shadow,
now lit up, and again in shadow, as a few clouds
straggled across the moon. When at length all
was clear, and she looked down, the three chiefs
were out in front of the house once more; and on
the ground near them, a man and woman lay in
each other’s arms, lashed together in half-a-dozen
different places. They formed a picture that
seemed to please Te Parehao’s idea of revenge; for
he regarded them often, and occasionally even
spoke to the woman in Maori, to the man in
broken English.
His wife of four months shed tears, only to be
jeered at; and the gum-merchant was fast going
into a stupor—partly through fear, and partly
because the tight binding was beginning to affect
his circulation.
They made too heavy a load to drag, so their
captors decided upon securing the services of a
cart-horse. And then another delicate question
took a few minutes’ consideration. Te Parehao
wished to hook the traces in some loops of the
supplejack binding, and perform the journey
without a sledge. His companions remonstrated ;
he would have no satisfaction when he reached the
coast. The way was rough, and it would kill
them. Te Parehao gave in reluctantly. When
all was ready to start, he stated his intention of
doing the rest of the work alone; rubbed noses
with his two assistants, and started on his way
merry as a chief should be who is enjoying a
thoroughly satisfactory revenge.
The moon had done three - fourths of her
night’s journey when he reached the coast, and
the strong salt air came pleasantly up over the
cliffs into his nostrils. He estimated the number
of capsizes on the way to be three. He never
looked back; but he heard the thud when the
sledge struck anything and turned over, and the
groans mingling with the traces’ rattle when the
load possibly caught against a stump, or helped
the sledge over a boulder. Then, when the horse
became quieter, he guessed the sledge had got
into its proper position again.
At the commencement of a steep incline, that
led down to a steeper cliff, Te Parehao stopped.
He walked to the very edge and looked coolly
over.
“ Good enough,” he said; and came back to
relieve the sledge of its load.
Then he uttered an exclamation. Either the
supplejacks binding the two necks had worked
loose, or the man’s neck was broken, for the head
had slipped down and rested on the shoulder of
the woman, whose eyes looked up now —not into
her lover’s, but into her husband’s. There was
still life in her.
‘‘Spare me,” she pleaded weakly, in the
native tongue. ‘‘The man you would kill with
me is already dead. Let me go ; and forget that
you married me. I will go away; only let me
live—let me live until my turn comes to die.”
For answer, Te Parehao lifted her partner s
head and placed the face against hers.”
“Kish ! ” he said ; “one good long kish.”
She did not speak, but when the head slipped
to the side again, her eyes turned on Te Parehao
with reproach, and the lower part of her face was
smeared with blood —blood not her own.
“Here! here!” said the chief. “Sure you no
sham ?” and he turned the pakeha’s face up.
Sham or no sham, one eye was glassy; and
where the other should have been there was a
simple hole. Blood ran from the mouth, and
clotted hlood was all over the beard.
“Ha! Never mind!” and Te Perehao pro-
ceeded to undo the fastenings that bound the man
and woman to the sledge. It did not take long.
“ See !” and he pointed down the sloping bank,
200 feet helow the edge of which lay the sea, glisten-
ing invitingly under the moon ; “ Quick way you
go to hell, eh ? Me gi’ you good shtart ’’—and he
began rolling them over. Five or six turns
sufficed; then they kept on without assistance,
and he stood and watched the result. Presently
the pace became hot; and first the woman, then the
man, was uppermost, whirling over and over and
hurrying to the edge.
# * *
It was days afterwards, and the sea rolled
in lazily. On the sand, a flock of birds of all sorts
and conditions; in the water, sometimes out of
sight, sometimes almost wholly to be seen, as each
wave curled over, something which interested
these birds greatly. A mermaid floating on her
back with her lover in her arms? Perhaps so.
At any rate, an old and dissipated-looking bird,
watching with the crowd, turned to his better half
and winked ; at which she looked the other way,
as a girl who blushes modestly. Yet, when the
waves had done with the two bodies, she was
among the first to waddle hungrily for a closer
inspection.

Going West.
[FOR T HE BULLENTIN.]
So you’ve left the town behind you
And in future we will find you
Out beyond the Never Never, out about the
boundless plain;
And I’m sorry that you’re going
Where the Western winds are blowing—
I was there when cheques were bigger, and I’ll
never go again.
For the roaring days are over,
And each unregenerate rover
Who had cheques to buy him welcome, and who
never lacked a friend,
Hardly earns a pound to squander,
But in search of work must wander
On an unrewarded journey that may never know
an end.
I was there when summer weather
And the Western grog together
Seemed to honeycomb my liver, so I gave the
whisky best;
And the relics of our party
May be living hale and hearty,
But I think you’ll find them sober if you meet
them in the West.
There is Tom, the Barcoo rambler,
And his mate, the two-up gambler;
Last I heard of them was somewhere down the
Flinders on the track ;
You will hear of Brown, the sawyer,
And his mate the back-blocks lawyer,
And some chaps I don’t remember who were
mates with Greenhide Jack;
But it doesn’t greatly matter
For they’ve mostly had to scatter,
And a lot of them took other names and rambled
further back,
Such as Scotty Mac, the ringer,
Likewise Sydney Bob, the singer ;
And, when you cross the Speewah, mind you ask
for Crooked Mick :
I am sure they’ll all befriend you.
And I’d gladly recommend you,
If you want a cheerful partner, just go mates with
Whistling Dick.
If you meet the Tambo Spider,
Or young Bricky Holt, the rider,
Ask them where Gilhooley’s got to—he].went out
with Lengthy Ike.
They’re all men of grit and daring,
Strong rough men of honest bearing,
Though they’ve grown a bit suspicious of all
strangers since the strike.
When your search for work is fruitless
And you wander lame and bootless,
When the summer drought is deadly, or in
winter’s dreary rain—
Blighted land and hellish weather,
You will curse the lot together—
I was there when cheques were bigger, and I’ll
never go again.
