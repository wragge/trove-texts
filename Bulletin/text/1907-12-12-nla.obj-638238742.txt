The RED PAGE
How is poetry written ? Does the poet’s
eye, in the moment of inspiration, really in
a fine frenzy roll ? And do imperishable
things like The Blessed Damosel and the Ode
on a Grecian Urn and Hamlet’s soliloquy
spring from the poet’s soul perfect, rounded,
complete ? Or must poems, like all other
living things, be born and grow ?
That a poem is born of a moment
of inspiration must be admitted. The
strange new thought comes, wonderfully
singing, into the listening mind, and
the poet, amazed and thrilling, recog-
nises its miraculous beauty. But a
thought is not a poem ; at the best it is
but a beautiful phrase. (Sometimes the
original singing line that inspires a poem
does not find room in the completed poem.)
Into the poet’s hands has been given a
wondrous uncut gem ; he divines its hidden
splendor, and—patient lapidary that he is—
he painfully cuts and polishes and smoothes
till, in its perfect setting, thO flawless beauty
of the gem shines clear. There may be little
lyrics which have sung themselves direct
from the poet’s heart to the waiting page,
and which the poet’s polishing would but
mar ; but the few glimpses permitted
us at the first drafts of celebrated poems
show us the painful evolution from
the first swift rough jottings to the perfect
final form. Keat’s Ode to a Nightingale, for
instance, in MS. draft shows many excres-
cences that the poet’s second thought has
pruned away, many lines that reflection has
wonderfully improved. Thus the opening
line,
My heart aches, and a drowsy numbness pains,
Originally began :
Small winged Dryad—
While “ a drowsy numbness pains ” was
evolved from “a painful numbness falls.”
And we may hazard the guess that even
this much amended rough draft may not
have been the actual first putting upon
paper of that poem. Pegasus needs the
bridle before he can be made to run con-
formably in metre.
J*
In order to illustrate the method of verse
writing, let us, like a spectacled botanist,
tear petal by petal some little flower of
poetry to pieces. Doubtless in such sacri-
ligious work we shall for ever destroy the
beauty of the poor little blossom ; but the
botanist must needs sacrifice one little victim
in order to win knowledge of the many. And
though the flower be mutilated, perhaps some-
what of the fragrance remains. But it is no
priceless bloom that we propose dissecting—
a little local wayside weed that must needs
be cut down that worthier flowers may blos-
som. The ruthless botanist has, of course,
no scruples, and if he could dissect a gor-
geous blossom of Shakespeare, or a rare
exotic of Sappho he would not hesitate.
Luckily, those are for ever beyond his
reach. Let us pull out, one by one, the little
petals of our local humble weed.
The verses that lie already stretched on
the dissecting-table above this article owe
their presence there to the fact that the poet
has happened to preserve every draft, how-
ever rough, made by him in the composition
and revision of this poem. The analysis which
we purpose making of the various editions
of the verses—there are no less than seven
drafts—will enable us to trace, with some -
pretence to exactitude, the slow and labored
evolution of the poem from its first crude
conception up to the finished product. But
there is a mental stage piior to the appear-
ance of a line upon paper which first needs
consideration—the first correlation of image's,
almost inarticulate, that it is quite im-
possible to catch and register. For this
stage we must take the personal evidence of
the poet—subsequently corroborating the
poet’s evidence by internal analysis of the
poem.
It is evident, thus, that the poem had its
genesis from two or three mental pictures
that flashed suddenly into the poet’s con-
sciousness. These ideas, which were pro-
bably quite disconnected, and may have
come to the poet at wide intervals of time,
were :
1. As the poet was looking down from
some height upon Mosman Bay., he was
struck with the resemblance of the black
smoke pouring from the ferry-boat to a plume
in a knight’s helmet.
2. Still looking down on the boat as it
approached, his mind noted its likeness to
some deep-sea shell-plated monster.
3. On boarding the boat at Circular Quay
there came to him a soothing sense of sudden
quiet—the turmoil of the city seemed sud-
denly and gratefully shut out.
Now let us see what the poet made of the
correlation of these three ideas—for the
impulse to write the poem sprang from a
recognition of their possible correlation. (It
may be critically noted that, after all, the
two points of view—one looking down on
the roof of the boat, as in the first two
stanzas, and the other inside the boat—
impair the artistic unity of the poem. But
possibly the poet was too vain of his first
two similes ruthlessly to cast them out. A
poet is like a foolishly fond mother to his
similes and metaphors.)
One calm morning the poet was sitting on
the boat—these three almost forgotten ideas
slumbering in his brain—-reading the
Herald. . . ,'He began idly thinking about
the plume of smoke.
The Mosman boat with his plume of smoke.
That phrase flashed into his mind. He
turned it reflectively over. . .. Yes, it might
be the opening line of a bit of verse—or,
better still, keep it for the last line : it would
gain greater strength—like a strong hand
in bridge—by being led up to. It sug-
gested the figure of some old knight with
his streaming plumes. But smoke .. .
awkward word to rime . . . moke, spoke,
joke. .. . Impossible. Still, it seems a
pity. Ah, couldn’t the line be inverted ?
With his plume of smoke the Mosman boat—
Instantly the required rime leapt into the
mind. Remote ... “a knight of a time
remote ! ”
So at the first available opportunity, the
poet wrote down his first verse thus :
It is like some knight of a time remote,
A rider in armor grey,
When with plume of smoke the Mosman boat
Comes sweeping up the bay.
But the rest of the poem urgently clamored
to be written. And through a forest of
rapidly scribbled lines, with much impatient
deleting, quick experiments and hasty
searches for rimes, the poem began to take
on its first shape. The actual first draft is
printed herewith in all its dreadful confusion.
The.experimental words and lines that* were
immediately crossed out and rejected are
printed in roman type, and the lines tem-
porarily retained for the second draft are
indicated by italics. As a further aid one
page of the MS. is reproduced in facsimile
herewith.

And a murmur of talk comes soothingly
Across the silence sweet.
And we fling the grim grey ships aside
And sidle to wharves of dream
And voyage to coves that seem
And the white-washed waves
And into round Gremorne we creep
ebbing
The city town recedes like a dreaming tide
As we sidle to wharves of sleep.

A smolder of roofs like a red

■ The red roofs crowning Mosman heights
Run like a ripple of fire.
Here we have the poem in germ, the Muse
in shocking, almost indecent, undress. Note
the many false starts, where ideas have
floated up to be seized, taken in hand, and
thrown away. Evidently the poet meant to
depict his boat at night; but the “pillar of
fire ” metaphor was not fresh enough or
striking enough to please him. It went
ignominiously overboard, and the “fairy-
palace ” abjectly followed. For the image
of the Quay floating away as the steamer
leaves had seized the poet, and hastily,
frenziedly he splashes his crude picture on the
canvas—out of which a finished stanza shall
at last be composed. But the “sudden,
dim retreat” and the “murmur of talk”
that “comes soothingly across the silence
sweet ” as the boat leaves the city
behind are lost in the subsequent revisions
of the poem ; the poet sees his way to give
the picture in a more literary, more allusive
way. It will be seen that Charon has not
yet come into the verses—Charon that in
the final form of the poem seems the central
figure round which it has been carefully
built. And the reader will notice, shame-
less, disgraceful, the list of rimes rapidly
scribbled down the edge of the paper in the
poet’s quick search for the word. He had to
abandon the “lights” rime and the lucky
thought of “ cars ” gave him his stanza com-
plete. Difficulties beset him, too, in his
rime to the next verse. The line,
We sidle to wharves of dream,
is infinitely more suggestive of peace, more
'musical, than “to wharves of sleep ; u t
after various quick experiments at rime the
poet fell back on “ sleep. ■’ And it will be
seen that his first instinct to end the poem
by a reference to the red roofs of Mosman
heights was wrong. And, anyhow, that
stanza worried him. We can fancy him
giving it up in disgust and turning back to
revise the whole poem, with this result:
It is like some knight of a time remote,
A rider in armor grey.
When with plume of smoke the Mosman boat
Comes sweeping up the bay !
When round the point we watch it swing
It seems as if from the deeps
Some clumsy, sqiiat, crustacean thing
On the sea-floor strangely creeps !
The clanging Quay, with its shuttling cars,
And the city float away,
In a shrinking blur of dimming stars,
And a sinking pile of grey.
We rush from the dusty city street;
Our gondola waits at the Quay.
The noise is left for a murmur sweet
Of voices from care set free.
We turn from the West’s slow-dying pyre,
Down the white-waked bay we go,
Where, running red—a ripple of fire—
On the heights the red roofs glow !
We shoulder the grim steel ships aside,
And round Cremorne we creep;
The city recedes like an ebbing tide,
As we sidle to wharves of sleep.
This draft is scribbled all ever by subse-
quent pencil markings—some made, the poet
tells us, at a table in the A.8.C., others
jotted down on ferry-boat and tram. Hence
comes draft No. 3, neatly copied in ink.
There are no changes in the first two stanzas
except that in the eighth line, “blindly”
is substituted for the less vivid word
“strangely.” Then follows these verses :
As we come from the city of dust and heat
In a sullen lethargy
Peace waits for us at the foot of the street:
Our gondola waits at the Quay.
’Tis Charon who stands at the long day’s close
For our spirits tired and worn ;
And the ancient tide of Lethe flows
Between Sydney and Gremorne !
The clanging Quay, with its shuttling cars,
The city’s gate, floats away
In a shrinking blur of dimming stars
And a drowning pile of grey.
And, done with labor and all desire,
Down the white-waked bay we go ;
Lo, running red —a ripple of fire —
The roofs of Mosman glow !
We shoulder the grim steel ships aside,
And as round Gremorne we creep,
The city recedes Eke an ebbing tide
As we sidle to wharves of sleep.
Two verses have been aptly transposed,
and many happy changes made. “The
dusty city street,” a precise epithet, has been
softened and refined into ‘ ‘ the city of dust
and heat,” and the image of weariness
is strengthened by the second line,
while the third new line gives the sense of a
suddenly closing door by its abrupt beginning.
And, despite the mediaeval image of a gon-
dola, the poet, sensing a greater simile, ana-
ehronistically makes his gondolier no less a
personage than ancient Charon. Henceforth
this intruder Charon dominates the poem,
and inevitably, as the poet came to
recognise, the gondola must go. Nothing
in any other verse must diminish the stanza
about Lethe. The “ sinking pile of grey ”
has been inevitably changed to a “drowning”
pile of grey, in order to get away from the
unwanted rime with “shrinking” in the
line above. “ The West’s slow-dying pyre ”
is good ; but it, too, conflicts with the sense
of peace that Lethe gives, and the change
can be commended. And all through, the
little links that bind the poem into one com-
plete chain are being slowly strengthened.
«£*
And thus, by a devious and difficult road,
at last we come out to the semi-final revise—
made nearly a month after the first impetu-
ous scribblings so shamelessly set forth.
Then, two months later, the poem was taken
from its drawer, and hammered at and
polished again into its final form.
We have pulled our little flower to pieces ;
its petals lie withering before you . .. and no
one can build its beauty up again. But we
have given a glimpse of the alchemy of the
poet’s brain. Indignant bards may protest
that their poems are ready-made, they drop
like the gentle dew from Heaven, untar- I
nished by earthly impurities. These bards
may be but soulless harps through which the
winds of Heaven blow as they list. But
this poet, in sincere humility, asserts that
from the vagrant winds of Heaven he has j
laboriously to make his poor and ineffectual
human melodies. j
THE MOSMAN BOAT.
It is like some knight of a time remote,
A rider in armor grey,
When with plume of smoke the Mosman boat
Comes sweeping up the bay.
Yet round the point as we watch it swing,
It seems as if from the deeps
Some clumsy, squat crustacean thing
On the sea-floor blindly creeps.
But oh, when ice come from the town of heat
In a sullen lethargy,
Peace waits for us at the foot of the street:
Sleep's Ferryman waits at the Quay!
Old Charon stands at the long day's close
For our spirits tired and worn:
The ancient tide of Lethe flows
Between Sydney and Cremorne.
The clanging Quay' with its shuttling cars —
The city’s life flows away
In a shrinking blur of dimming stars
And a drowning pile of grey.
And, done with labor and all desire,
Down the white-waked bay we go ;
Till, running red—a ripple of fire—
The roofs of Mosman gloio.
We shoulder the grim grey ships aside,
And as round Cremorne we creep,
The city recedes Tike an ebbing tide,
And we sidle to wharves of sleep.

THE Beale Australian Pianos are built specially to withstand
sudden and extreme climatic changes. The timber used is
seasoned here in Australia, in the very climate and under the
very conditions that are to be found throughout the year. As former
importers, we know the value of this, for our experience has taught
us that imported pianos, which are built during the European sum-
mer, stand this climate better than those which are prepared there
during the winter. Further, our method of seasoning, by combined
open-air and kiln process, has been pronounced by experts to be one
of the best and most up-to-date systems. In addition, every stick of
timber, before being used in a Beale Australian Piano, is carefully
tested in a special apparatus, which at once reveals whether it is fit
for use. Then our patent system of building the cabinet work in
cross-plies; our patented iron wrest-plank, eliminating the wooden
wrest-plank, still used in all other Pianos (iron and steel will stand
climatic change better than wood), and our special sounding-board,
which is constructed to resist the most trying heat—all these
combine to make the Beale Australian Piano proof against the severe
and sudden changes of weather which make such havoc of the
majority of imported Pianos. And this is why, wherever the Beale
Piano goes, it gives the most lasting satisfaction : this is why, wherever
a Piano is needed for a home in a district where the climate is most
trying, the Beale Australian Piano is the best obtainable; and it
naturally follows that we have thousands of testimonials from all
classes of the community confirming and corroborating our claims,
and speaking in the most glowing terms of the

A Laxative & Tonic Pill.
It has long been recognised by the Medical Profession that if a Pill could be invented
which was laxative in principle, and still at the same time was of known tonic value, that
same would fill a long-felt want. The great difficulties to overcome were that most of the
known vegetable tonics were all strong astringents, so that, while the administration of
these tonics proved of great value to the patient as a stimulant, still they were very prone
to greatly interfere with his digestion, and cause stomach trouble ; also, to add to the
difficulty, the effect of most all vegetable cathartics was to weaken, distress, and sicken, so
that, while the patient might be relieved from the action of the cathartic, he was also greatly
depressed by the weakening and sickening of the entire system. To overcome these diffi-
culties was of more moment than at first appeared, and it was only after several years of
intricate chemical research that the combination known as LAXO-TONIC PILLS was
invented.
These Pills are unique in many ways.
Firstly, they are positively guaranteed to be purely vegetable, and contain no mineral
salts of any description.
Secondly, they are entirely harmless, and are as safe for the youngest child as for the
full-grown adult.
Thirdly, the tonic principles employed in these Pills are entirely of a non-poisonous
nature, and there are no such dangerous drugs as strychnine, mercury, morphine, and so
forth.
Fourthly, no drastic purgatives are employed, which are always dangerous, owing to
their uncertain action. The laxatives employed are entirely new, having never before been
employed in like preparations.
From a scientific standpoint LAXO-TONIC PILLS are pharmaceutically perfect, and
do their work physiologically. There Pills are marketed in a gelatine capsule which readily
dissolves in the stomach, and protects the Pill from deteriorating in any way by coming in
contact with the elements.
LAXO-TONIC PILLS are designed to suit both sexes, and are of particular value to
women who are at all inclined to be ansemic. LAXO-TONIC PILLS are an unsurpassed
blood purifier and spring medicine, and produce rich, red blood, and on account of their
tonic effect upon the whole system they are of particular value to everyone in the spring
time. Anyone who will take the trouble to carefully note the effect of these Pills will be
greatly surprised at their powerful yet gentle action. >
LAXO-TONIC PILLS have been marketed to meet a long-felt want, and to those who
desire to get their money’s worth in medicine, the same as other necessities of life, they will,
we believe, greatly appeal, as they are being offered to the public at a remarkably low price,
namely, boxes containing 25 Pills, 10M. ; boxes containing 50 Pills, 1/6. One Pill one dose.
Obtainable from all chemists and storekeepers, or will be sent post free to any part
of Commonwealth or New Zealand upon receipt of the price in stamps by
LAXO-TONIC PILL COMPANY, 15 O’Connell Street, Sydney.

THE HEATHEN IN HIS BLINDNESS.
NEWLY- ARRIVED MISSIONARY (pleasantly): “YOU SEE, I'VE BROUGHT YOU SOMETHING FOR YOUR CHRISTMAS DINNER!"


The Ship of All Creation.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
ON seas not girt nor bounded,
Nor measured in degrees—
Uncharted and unsounded
Interminable seas—
Not needing navigation
Past any shoal or coast,
The Ship of All Creation
Bears out her living host.
She drifts 5 she is not sailing,
Nor is she steered or led,
But, through the ages trailing
The Wake of All Things Dead-
Through endless desolation,
Eternal dark and cold—
She rolls, the hulk Creation,
Unutterably old.
A misty veil before us,
A future shut from sight j
The past, whereout she bore us,
Receding into night;
She bears all things organic—
The dust, and weeds, and slime ;
Dwarfed forms of growths Titanic;
The lees and dregs of Time.
We, who with vain elation
Re-find old things anew,
Forget the ship Creation
Is ancient through and through ;
That tribes, and types, and races
Have had their day of strife,
And, passing, left no traces
Of all their complex life.
We, proud of subtle learning,
The living kingdoms’ kings,
Shall go, no more returning,
And be forgotten things ;
Despite all innovation,
Grown hoar with ages’ rime,
The derelict Creation
Rolls down the Sea of Time.
Our prime was passed in ages
When man was half a brute;
And tons of dusty pages
His bones may not refute.
But stunted now and hoary,
And full of senile pains,
We’re in the closing story
As all Creation wanes.
For slowly forging forward,
A worn and weed-logged ark,
Perchance she’s drifting shoreward
To lands where all is dark ;
Her shrunken animation
To hide in gathered rime—
A wrecked and dead Creation
On frigid Seas of Time !
VIC.

The Prehistoric Jones.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
EDWARD JONES, bank clerk, turned
to shut the garden gate as he left his little
suburban cottage in Mosman. His wife
waved him good-bye from the open door. ‘ ‘ You’ve
just time to catch the tram, Ted,” she anxiously
called, as she had anxiously called every morning
for eleven years. “ You mustn’t be late at the
office.”
That awkward step at the gate—he meant to
mend it next Saturday afternoon—caught his foot.
He slipped backwards.
AT DINNER.
MR. BORSTRUTH (savagely): “Cold mutton again!
I wish I was in Sheol.”
MRS. BORSTRUTH (meekly): “ Why, dear?”
MR. BORSTRUTH : “Because if I was I could get
a hot meal now and again, anyhow."
There ensued a sudden gap in the consciousness
of Edward Jones. He looked up to see a woman
bending over him, muttering tremulous anxiety.
He put a hand —a clumsy, hesitant hand—to the
back of his head. What was this being that raised
him in her arms? What was it all about . . .?
He shut his eyes deliberately, then opened them.
Still he did not know . . . he did not recognise . . ,
Where was he? Who was this woman? He
seemed to have lost something. What was it ?
Who ah, yes, that was what his brain clamored
to know—who was he ? And why .. . ?
The woman spoke soothing words. He did not
understand.
“ I’m—l’m all right,” he said at last, with a
curious fumbling speech. Then suddenly he
raised himself. There was something he must
do, something that throbbed at the back of his
dull head. He had to go somewhere...
“You’re sure you can go to the bank?” the
woman anxiously questioned.
Ah, yes; that was it. He had to go to the
bank. He looked up and down the little lane,
afraid.
You mustn’t be late, then. They spoke to
you about being late last week.” The woman
urged him, timorously.
“I’m all right,” he repeated. He wished he
could remember who the woman was, her
name ... It had all gone from him. But there
remained the bank. He didn’t in the least re-
member what a bank was; yet it was evidently
important that he should reach it. Also, he must
not be late. He took a few unsteady steps down
the lane.
“Not that way, dear,” the woman called.
“You’re going the wrong way.”
Ah, he was going the wrong way. Obediently
he turned. His wife watched him go.
“ Ted’s had a nasty shake,” she said.
Ted had never had a bad fall before. It didn’t
seem right to let him go. Yet there was the
bank and he mustn’t be late. She watched him
walking cautiously, yet upright and with pur-
pose, out of sight. As she went inside she
decided she would ring him up at the bank from
her neighbor’s, though the bank discouraged
private telephone messages to its clerks.
Edward Jones went onward through a land
that seemed utterly unfamiliar. At first, striving
intently to recall whom he was, he did not notice
the country. But there were other people walk-
ing in the same direction through a forest that
seemed curiously cut up by tracks; and on both
sides there were quaint huts like no hut
he had ever seen. How had he come to this
strange land, and—insistently—who was he?
borne men ahead of him stopped, and mechani-
cally he stopped, too. They were waiting for
something. He recalled that in the forest he had
often waited like this when out hunting. Some
strange beast was coming this way, along that
wide track. They were going to kill it. He had
often hunted before, but not in a country like this.
Suddenly, as he warily watched, around a
corner of the track came an enormous beast, spit-
ting and growling, a beast aglitter and swift. He
waited to see how the others would attack it. One
hunter could do nothing against such a monster—
and he looked curiously at the black, soft weapon
with a curved haft that he carried in his hand. He
would see what the tribe would do.
The animal stopped with a growl. To his con-
sternation the tribe climbed on to its back.
Hurry on, please ! ” said a man standing on
its neck.
Ah, it was tame ! He remembered that there
were big animals in those jungles which his tribe
had captured and tamed, and, sitting on their
necks, had guided with pointed sticks. This
must be another mammoth. He climbed up, too.
Then he cowered in his seat. Two of the tribe
opposite him were breathing smoke! These,
thought Edward Jones with a shudder, must be
gods. It was a terrible country into which he
j, had come.
The great beast,
| growling angrily,
I rushed down a
J steep valley to
I the sea. It was
I £°ing to drown
j them all! But the
man on its neck
I made it stop, and
Edward Jones,
| with a great re-
lief, got down.
The others were
hastening into a
big hut built on
piles over the sea.
Edward Jones
remembered his
own hut; he had
built it over the
water to escape
the aurochs and
the tribe on the
other side of the
mountain. Fol-
lowing the tribe,
he shrank back
from an enormous
leviathan thathad
swum up to the
hut. But the
others pushed him
on, and he actu-
ally got upon its
back. This sea-
beast must be
tame, too. Certainly, this was a place of the gods.
It was a curious forest that the great fish was
bringing him to. Edward Jones in all his experi-
ence had never seen such a place of precipices.
Following the others, he got safely off the levia-
than’s back, and reached a wide track, along
which other growling mammoths were rushing.
But Edward Jones was not afraid of these ; he,
the mighty hunter, had tamed one and ridden on
its back just as he had called the leviathan from
the deep, and compelled it to his behests. (They
always said in the bank that Jones’s fault, as a
clerk, was an excess of imagination. Frequently
he used to imagine that he was a bank-manager.
"HIS EXCELLENCY."
That was why he was still a clerk.) Edward
Jones cautiously crossed the wide track, and came
into the place of precipices. On each side of
the track lofty cliffs rose straight to the sky,
cliffs with holes everywhere in them, and
breathing smoke. It occurred to Edward Jones
that it must be difficult to capture mammoths,
when they so easily could escape into these open-
ings. He stood in the middle of the track staring.
A snarling hunched beast, with a red, shiny
skin, lurched at him, howling defiance. He
struck at it with his soft black spear, and it
swerved aside and disappeared, spitting white
smoke. So close did the red beast come that
Edward Jones still smelt its stifling hot breath.
He, the vanquisher of aurochs red and yellow,
swaggered down the track.
A big man, who had painted himself blue, sud-
denly raised his arm threateningly at him.
Edward Jones attempted to spear him with his
black, fat spear ; but the crook of the haft spoiled
his aim, and the blue-painted foe was upon him.
Edward Jones attempted to execute a wrench
that would have flung his foe with a broken neck
—an easy feat that he remembered now he had
often performed ; but, to his dismay, the strength
had gone out of his muscles. He found himself
on his back.
But the blue-painted man had recognised him,
and the anger died out of his red face.
“ What, Mr. Jones !” he said in surprise. “I
thought you was a drunk.”
“ The bank !” gasped Jones. “ I must get to
the bank ! ”
“Oh, you’re in a hurry ; that’s it ? Well, next
time don’t attempt to cross when I stop yer.
You’ll be run over, sir.”
Edward Jones, the conqueror of all blue-
painted men, swaggered on between the preci-
pices ; but his career was nearing its end.
Down the track came a new monster—an enor-
mous black ugly thing, with one antenna, thrust
aloft, and spitting water from enormous jaws. It
came on slavering foam, horrible, glittering, with
its tremendous head lowered for the charge.
Edward Jones was ready for it; he had slain ali
the others; he would add this skin to his pile.
What a tale he would have to tell when he got
home to his wives ! He crouched with his black
spear ready. The black monster came slowly on.
Edward Jones, the great hunter, got fright-
ened. This was a new sort of auroch ; there was
a horrible grimness about it that gripped his super-
stitious soul with awe. This black beast must be
the god of this place of precipices; and he had
offended it. It would capture him, rend him. Yes,
indeed, it was a god. None but a god could go on
spouting rivers of water from its jaws ; the track
behind it was wet from side to side. All the
waterfalls he had previously met had been
stationary. This one had a penchant for travel.
It was a god.
Edward Jones fell on his knees. He would
make sacrifice to its anger—with his life. It
must be rather a glorious death—the death of a
warrior—to be crunched beneath that enormous
body. Edward Jones waited for the end. .. .
A blue-painted man picked him up. Edward
Jones looked up at a ring of faces, faces of men of
the tribe. .. . What tribe? That blue-painted
man, who was he ?
“Only a slight cut on the back of the head,”
said a man who was bending over him. “ Nothing
serious, though the shock has dazed him. Hullo !
That’s curious. The cut is over a heavy bruise on
the same place—made at least an hour ago. He
evidently makes a habit of being run over.”
Edward Jones’s consciousness returned. “ He’s
not a blue-painted man at all,” he genially re-
marked to the crowd. “ He’s a policeman.”
The crowd received the information without
emotion, gaping.
Edward Jones raised himself. “And that,” he
declaimed, point-
ing to the big
black beast that
had knocked
him over, “that
isn’t a black
auroch ; that’s a
street - watering
car !”
The doctor
nodded signifi-
cantly to the
policeman. “ A
bit dazed yet,”
he said, “but
he’ll be all right
in a few min-
utes.” Then to
Jones, “What is
your name ? ”
“Edward
Jones,” he an-
swered trium-
phantly.
“And what is
your profession,
sir ? ” said the
policeman with
his note - book
open.
“I’m a mighty
hunter of mam-
moths, theslayer
of all blue-paint-
ed enemies, the
tamer of levia-
thans,” he beam-
ingly remarked.
“Same old
Jones!” came a
voice from the
crowd. Edward
J ones recognised
a fellow-clerk.
“No I’m a
bank clerk,’’ he
abjectly con-
tinued, “and
that”—he took a
limp, soft, black
spear, badly
bent, from the
hands of the
police m a n—
“and that—that’s
my umbrella !”
But Edward
Jones had had
his one crowded
hour of glorious
life.
He is still a
bank clerk ; but
the bent um-
brella hangs beside a boomerang on the wall over
the mantelpiece in his suburban home.

Waiting.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
SHE left me ’cos my leg went broke —’twas
wrecked in a last-night row ;
And here I wait for the southward stroke
of her ocean-splitting prow.
They’ve cast me loose from the Hospital, and I’m
round at the Sailors’ Home;
And I’m like a joss that’s lost its pal, or a tower
that has lost its dome.
For I ain’t been used to their longshore ways, and
I ain’t been used to bed ;
And I ain’t been used to the carts and drays, or
the train-roar overhead.
So I wish ter Heaven my ship would come, and
take me out of this ;
And I wonder now where her engines hum and
her pistons throb and hiss !
I ’spect she’s thrashin’ past Cape Yerde and up
Las Palmas way;
And I wish ter Gawd she’d send me word acrost
them miles of spray.
For I’m out of place in this roarin’ town, where
the tram-cars chase me fast,
And I’ll whoop when they say she’s steamin'
down the Suez ditch at last!
For my leg goes “ lump ” on the hard old street,
and my heart goes “ lump ” as well;
It’s a different tune I guess I’ll beat when I heat-
her engine-bell!
For she’s left me here with a quid or two, but how
is her engine-room ?
Does she cut the ocean cleanly through, and how
does her shaftin’ boom ?
Impious hands is laid on her —by reason of this
’ere leg—
For I’m limpin’ round like a booted cur with a
dislocated peg.
Ho ! I think I see her drivin’ now, with her nose
laid to the seas;
Ho ! I think I see her jabbing prow, and I hear
her crossheads wheeze!
She’s a black old tank of the tramp-ship class, an’
I’ve known her many a year ;
An’ the pubs of the world have grabbed the brass
of her pagan engineer.
But here I a,m on a dashed old crutch, a-hoppin’
around in woe;
And somebody else has got in touch with the gear
I used ter know !
Is her glands correct an’ her bearin’s right—are
her firebars bendin’ low ;
Does she chew her way through the roaring night
in the way that she usfed ter go ?
We’ve staggered around the bloomin’ earth, an’
we’ve crossed it back an’ forth ;
We have wound the knots around its girth, east,
south, and west and north !
We’ve carted this and we’ve carted that to all the
ports that be,
And I used ter fool like an acrobat ’mongst her
mad machinery !
But now she’s gone and left me here—left me on
the wharf to wait;
And I hate the girls an’ rum an’ beer with a
super-heated hate !
It was girls an’ rum that busted me, in a riot of
legs an’ chairs;
And I saw the stars from their anchors gee when
I leaped three flights of stairs !
When the old tank left I was lyin’ there, with my
leg in some old dash splints ;
An’ the nurse says “Hssh !” when I’d roar and
swear, and the red-haired sawbones squints.
But they cast me loose five weeks ago—five Sheols
it seems to me ;
And I muse where the tramp-ships lie a-row, an'
I long ter be back at sea !
I’m a lonely man in a roarin’ town, an’ a lonely
man I’ll be
Till that black old tramp comes thund’rin’ down
from Ham burg ’crost the sea !

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
AWAKE, and rise and shine ! The foc’s’le
bell
Proclaims the hour—the hour we know
too well.
And lo ! the watch on deck comes creeping forth,
Consigning ship and skipper both to .
’Tis four a.m. We start—a tarry mob
Of toilers—armed with bucket, broom and swab.
And at a harsh command we forward move
Like puppets—each to his respective job.
We do our graft (our bodies caked with brine)
Like oiled machines—in weather rough or fine ;
And when our watch is o’er, we go to sleep
In one compartment, like a lot of swine.
Our tucker? Ancient “pantiles” hard as wood.
Ye gods ! If this is “ pure and wholesome food,”
I often wonder how the owners fare,
Or if their stomachs yearn for “ something good.”
A dirty wooden “ kid ” beneath a bunk,
A lump of fearsome flabby-loolcing “junk.”
This, then, our frugal fare from day to day,
Till Sunday comes—then we get “dandyfunk. ’
Some strive, and win the laurels of the great,
Flinging their views right in the teeth of Fate ;
But we poor devils, when we battle hard,
Get nought but growls and curses from the mate.
And that perverted crowd, the Board of Trade,
Whose schedule rules our spuds and marmalade,
Lift not your hands to It for help—for It
Is mostly what the owners It have made !
The Board no questions asks of eyes or nose
About the blatant beef. Aboard it goes ;
But when old foc’s’le Jack is eating it,
He knows about it—PHEW !!—HE NOSE HE
KNOWS!
And if the tea you drink, the “junk” you chew
Amounts to almost nothing—which it DO! —
Then fancy while you scoff your sordid fare
That it is ham-and-eggs or Irish stew!
They say the skipper and the owners reap
Vast profits; when old Fo’c’s’le Jack dips deep
Into the slop-chest, where the shoddy lies —
The shoddy dearly sold, but purchased cheap.
Ah ! shipmates, if we could some day conspire
To grasp the ship and cargo all entire,
Would we not run her on the beach—and then
Consume the darned old rattletrap with fire?
Who blames us if on shore the cup that cheers
Is used to drown the cares of bygone years ?
We care not. With a girl upon our knees.
We sink our woes in long and hefty beers !

we was flush o’ sinkers that mornin’, ’avin’ farnd

“ There was a bit of a joggle on, an’ now’n agin
a big wive ’ud wet us all over, which Dan ’ated
worse’n a cat. I don’t mind so much, ’cos I goes
surf-bavin’ sometimes, an’ so I’m a bit used t’
washin’. But Dan !—why, yous ’ud think ’e was
killed every time a wive splashed ’im. At larst,
‘Let’s git art o’ this, Micko,’ ’e sez, an’ as we
wasn’t doin’ too good, I says ‘ Right-o ! ’
“ Dan ’ad just begun to wind up when ’e got a

Dan ’ad ’is work cut art. ’ls fingers was cut wit’

to drownd itself. It was careful goin’ then,

says Dan, an’ bump come

Then we sat darn to rest awhile under
a bit of a cave afore we tried to climb
up the clift, ’cos it was a tough climb-
one place yous ’ad to go up ’and over
’and on a wire rope. An’ while we sat
there, ’arf-a-dozen big lumps o’ sandstone smashed
theirselves to hatoms on the rocks at our feet,
which we drew in sudden, I promise yous. We
got as far back in the cave as we could, an’ said
a ’ole lot o’ things abart the silly coots what

After a bit we come out, an’ begun our climb, an’,
as we climbed, we ’eard more ’arf-bricks ’ittin’

‘ I’ll give that somethink to remember
me by, Micko ’; an’ I reckoned I'd get in a few
words too.
“We reached the top, ’nd there was the Percy -
bloke an’ a tart, ’nd the Percy-bloke was shyin’
stones over the clift as if ’e ’ad a contract. ‘ ’Ere,’
says Dan, ‘wot th’ ’ell are yous up to, young
feller-me-lad ? ’
“The Percy-bloke looked rarnd, an’ see the
bandage on Dan’s ’ead. ‘ W-was you below ?’ he
says, frikened-like.
‘“We was,’ says Dan.
“I seen the Percy-bloke look at the bandage
agen, an’ I says, ‘Me mate’s ’urt pretty bad wit’
y’r stone-throwin’.’
“ An’ then the tart chips in : ‘ I told you not to
throw ’em, Fred. I said there might be some-
body down there.’
“ ‘lf ’e’d on’y took your advice ! ” says Dan.
‘ But ’e didn’t. An’ so I must trouble yous for
y’er name an’ address, me lad, an’ I’ll report this
to the police, an’ then go to the doctor. You’re
old enough to know better’n to chuck rocks abart

“The Percy-bloke put ’is ’and in ’is kick.
‘ ’Ow much,’ ’e says, ‘to say nothink abart it ? A

“ Dan was ’orrified that the Percy-bloke should
take ’im for that sort o’ man. Not all the gold in
Australia ’ud stop ’im informin’ the Johns.
‘Why, I might’ave bin killed,’ ’e says. ‘Such
careless ’abits must be put darn.’
“The Percy-bloke bid again. ‘ Two quid,’ ’e
says.
“But Dan was still dead shook on tellin’ the
Johns. An’ ’e kep’ that way till the Percy-bloke

“ ‘ Well,’ ’e says, ‘ I’ll tike it f’r th’ lydy’s sike ;

“‘Oh, stow it!’ says the Percy-bloke, very
shirty, ’andin’ over the five notes, an’ mizzlin'

“ ‘ ’Alves ! ’ I says to Dan as soon as the pair

“ ‘ Wot for ? ’ says Dan.
“ ‘ I thought of it,’ says I.
“ ‘ I got the sore ’ead,’ says ’e.
“‘Well,’ says I, ‘if yous don’t div. I’ll git

“ ‘ Git work ! ’ ’e says.
“ Arter the scrap I left ’im, an’ ’e wasn’t feelin’

The Fire.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
FIRE-CARTS and fire-engines and
things went gonging past our boarding-
house just after midnight on New Year’s
Eve. There were hundreds of them. We were
all in bed, but by the time the 217th fire-engine
had shrieked and flamed past, everybody was on
the verandah or the balcony. A chap tearing
along in his pyjama-coat said that it was a wool
warehouse. We whooped, and made a rush for
the street—all except the Christian Temperance
lady boarder, who couldn’t find her corsets. If she
left them off, she would reckon she had started
on the Road to Ruin.
Brangwin and Lucette went down in a hansom.
They were both in evening dress —which the pen-
sive widow afterwards said looked suspicious.
The widow clung to the arm of the biggest man—
Graham. Broody’s wife went with Broody, and
Reggie and Marion hailed a fish-cart.
It was a bewchus fire—all sparky and smoky
and belchy. Who wants Williamson’s panto-
mimes ? But the crowd was more bewchus than
the fire. There were Lovely Ladies come from
supper, looking ju3t the thing in the firelight.
There were chaps in dinner-jackets and motor-
cars. Williemotor Kelly was there, and you could
tell without looking twice that he had just won
an election. Also Billy Maloney. Likewise a
member of the House of Rich Landlords, sharing
a hansom with a most expensive Dress. There
were many deadbeats, who had been sleeping in
the doorways, and Tarts of all sizes, shapes, and
ages. About 117,000 Chows. And everybody
was swearing. They said it was a Blanky Fine
Fire. The fire-brigade officers stopped to listen
to the crowd swearing, so they could learn some-
thing.
Millions of police ! Last big fire the papers
growled at the police, so every bobby in the city
came to this fire. 'They all said “ Move on ” and
“Stand back,” and helped the crowd to swear.
Brangwin went and stood beside a bobby, and
just gazed at him with a miserable, sad look.
Brangwin must have had champagne for supper ;
he couldn’t have done it so well on beer. Bobby
shifted. Brangwin followed and gazed some
more.
“Look ’ere,” said 4361, “you’re doin’that to
annoy me.”
Brangwin kept on gazing. But Lucette pushed
him softly with one finger in the middle of the
back, and he fell in three pieces into the bobby’s
arms. He must have had whisky as well as wine.
Lucette pulled him together and sat him on a
doorstep.
At two o’ clock we took all the girls home. We
said we’d find a pub and have one drink before
we came in. Also we’d bring home some beer.
We found the pub. It was kept by a pretty
woman whom everybody called Tessie. At the
ninth drink Brangwin wanted to elope with
Tessie, because he was the only man in the room
who had a shirt on. Then somehow we scattered ;
I think the cabbies did it deliberately. At six
o’clock I had breakfast with Broody in a Dago
restaurant. We were all talking about some girl
with blue eyes. (Mem. —Must ask the cabby who
and where.)
Broody ate four eggs and drank half a pint of
Worcester sauce. He said he must go home
sober, or his wife would be cross. She was. She
came out on the balcony and told us to pay the
cabman and stop our noise. Cabby said we owed
him fifteen bob for driving us to St. Kilda for a
swim.
At dinner the Christian Temperance lady told
Brangwin he looked pale. He said he had heart
disease. Reggie didn’t turn up till four in the
afternoon, and he brought home a gramophone.
Said he won it in a raffle. It played the ‘ ‘ Old
Bull and Bush ” till tea-time.
Next night the fire-cart went banging down the
street again, but nobody shifted. We just looked
at each other like guilty consciences.
PYRAMID.
After Cattle.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
WE lit a fire, and straightway camped,
And all night long
We heard the river sing a song.
Our horses fed, and neighed, and stamped,
But else, o’er all
A haunted silence seemed to fall.
The gum-trees raised their lofty crests
So high, it seemed
They mingled with the stars and dreamed.
As when a tired bird sinks and rests
At end of day,
Head couched on arm full length we lay.
But Nature would not let us sleep,
She loved so well
To talk, and had such things to tell.
Her fire-fly lamps within the deep
Green gullies shone
One moment, and the next were gone.
The smooth white trunks of ancient trees
In stately pride
Marched up the rugged mountain side.
No leaf fell fluttering on the breeze ;
But everywhere
A stillness charmed the midnight air.
And as we lay without a word,
In silence camped,
Our horses in the darkness stamped.
At first, it seemed a timid bird
Sang soft below,
And then ... we listened, breathing low.
We heard, elusive, strange, and shy,
A song arise—
The river voicing many cries.
At first, it was a human cry
Of sad unrest,
Of one cast down and sore distressed.
And then, an elfin chant it raised,
As when men cry
“ We’ve silks to sell; who’ll buy, who’ll buy!”
And goods were cried and wares were praised ;
It seemed like some
Far market-place in Fairy-dom.
Yet, ever through the chorus stole
The sore-distressed,
Faint human note of sad unrest.
We woke and saw the morning roll
In waves of gold
Upon the mountains green and bold.
Birds sang, flowers laughed, the grass was
green;
The sky above
Bent over, arching earth with love.
And riding through that woodland scene
Of rocks and rills,
We heard the cattle in the hills.

A HEALTH-TRIP TO THE COUNTRY. — ( By Hop ’s Understudy.)


The Shepherd Kings of
Canterbury.
THE AFFAIR AT STUDHOLME CREEK.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE affair at Studholme Creek was
one of the little things which change the
course of history. It was like the bolt
from the blue, and the random shot that gets
home between the joints of the harness—a thing
not to be foreseen or guarded against in any way.
At the time it happened it was regarded as of no
importance. And yet it was a vastly significant
affair. It was the first repulse of the Shepherd
Kings, and although their strength and influence
lasted long years afterwards, they were never so
strong again, and gradually ceased to be regarded
as a power to be reckoned with in the develop-
ment of the country. In their pompous manner
they had always scoffed at the idea of being wiped
out by political means. They took practically no
heed of “colonial politics,” and it was only the
international European situation which really in-
terested them. With the details of “ The
Eastern Question” they were thoroughly at
home, and were fairly well informed as to the
progress of the Russians in Siberia, and in the
Central Asian Khanates, but of local politics they
knew little, and cared even less.
There was only one question that affected them,
and that w’as the steadily increasing tide of immi-
gration, and the slow but certain development of
a number of townships along the line which
Bealey had said would be the trunk railway of
the South Island. They suddenly realised that if
people came, sheep would probably go. And,
damme, didn’t they live by sheep ?
Scattered over the vast expanse of the Canter-
bury Plains were patches of ground totally un-
suitable for pastoral purposes, and these, the
Shepherd Kings suddenly discovered with dismay,
had been cut up and sold as small farms on which
families were already struggling to raise crops in
the teeth of the terrific winds which swept the
treeless land.
From splendid homesteads, bowered in huge
plantations of quick-growing trees of the pinus
family, the Shepherd Kings looked out, half
contemptuously, half pityingly, at the grim
struggle between these poor, hard-working people
and the burning nor’-westers and freezing
westers. They did not believe that the farmers
had a chance. They saw the crops, with the earth
they grew in, blown bodily for miles, and piled
against some fence till the posts and wire disap-
peared. They saw houses blown over on their
sides, and drove out to give some little assistance
to the helpless women and children, and asked,
in a tone of affable hauteur, if it wasn’t wicked to
try and make homes where Providence had evi-
dently determined there should never be any.
Then they saw the long lines of boulders rise
as break-winds. Boulders lay over the surface of
■the plains in fearful profusion, and the ploughs
irooted out armies more, for the soil, though rich,
was appallingly stony. And these very draw-
backs the industry of the indomitable farmers
used to fight the destructive winds. Inside their
stone walls they planted long lines of the pinus
insignis, and in a few years the land began to look
less naked, and the crops waved in security, in
spite of the howling winds.
Then the Shepherd Kings
became alarmed. This pro-
cess of settlement must be
blocked in the interests of
their children. Hitherto, any
aggression must needs have
come across the Waitaki
from the south, or the
Hurunui, out of the empty
wastes of Nelson, on the
north. But with this popu-
lation growing up in the
province itself a struggle
would become inevitable
sooner or later. So the
Shepherd Kings set their
faces against settlement,
practically taking up the
whole district under grazing
lease, and leaving only the
insecure areas in the river-
beds unoccupied.
But Governor Grey was
a hard man to deal with.
He believed in settlement,
and between Bealey, the
Superintendent, and Grey, the
Governor, the people con-
tinued to drift into Canter-
bury, settling in the river-
beds and on the land that was
found for them by some occult
means.
The question became serious.
The squatters held a great
conference at Oterama station,
at the invitation of Neville Mor-
timer, a most aristocratic wool
king, whose real name bluff old
Bealey always declared was Job Jenkins.
From the French windows that opened on to
the deep verandah of Oterama station squatter
Mortimer Job Jenkins used to look down on the
settlement at Studholme Creek, and frown
grimly.
And yet there was nothing to frow'n at. It was
an almost idyllic spot. The creek, drifting slug-
gishly dow'n to the blue Rakaia, was marked by a
green course of weeping willows. Around it the
cattle browsed in fields of white clover. Corn-
fields waved in the autumnal wind. And the
creek itself was a charming stream. Where it
ran somewhat swiftly, shoals of whitebait drifted
up and down, and cock-a-bullies and little kaura
crayfish darted about. Where it ran in level
places the course was blocked with mint, water-
cress and musk, and the drifting odor scented
the whole settlement. There were places where
the willows grew in great clusters —there were
wide deep pools in which the sons and daughters
of the farmers bathed and swam in the hot
summer afternoons.
*• * * *
That the conference of Wool Kings sitting
at Oterama had decided to wipe out the small
settlers was well known. The only mystery
was how to do it. Knowing the way
they fought one another, the farmers ■fully
expected that their crops would be set on fire
and a general conflagration created, in which even
their homes would be probably destroyed. As a
matter of fact, the squatters had no such inten-
tions. They proposed something much more
deadly. They decided to found a loan and
mortgage company, and eat the farmers up, bones
and skin. The company would be formed osten-
sibly with English capital, for the purpose of
developing Canterbury. The company is still in
existence, but nowadays it eats squatter and
farmer impartially.
Something like a panic reigned through the
agricultural settlements. And small wonder.
For the farmers believed that the Wool Kings
were all powerful. They were all magistrates,
and they and their sons were the officers, and
their men the rank and file of the Yeomanry
regiments, the finest volunteer troops in all
Maoriland. The Yeomanry were supposed to be
volunteers for the protection of the country, but
in Old Canterbury, at least, everybody looked
upon the force as really the army of the Wool
Kings. There were other volunteers in Canter-
bury, but the Yeomanry never reviewed with
them. This force was trained and exercised by
its officers on the plains, in the river beds, and
among the shingle reaches, and the only time it
was seen in Christchurch was when it sent a rifle
team there to mop up all the musketry prizes.
Also, it was told that Neville Mortimer had once
said, when there had been public indignation at
some action of the squattocracy :
“ Let ’em snarl, and damn them. If it comes
to a row, we’ll bring along 2000 of the best horse-
men and rifle-shots in the country, and if they
can beat that—well, good luck to ’em.”
Then came the affair at Studholme Creek, and
Hori Grey touched the Squatter Phantom and
turned it to smoke.
A party of young squatters from Oterama,
finding themselves on the banks of the creek, rode
along in the shade of the willows till they cafse.-
to a party of girls, the daughters of adjacent
farmers, bathing in one of the large pools. On
the clover, close to the water’s edge, lay a table-
cloth, and traces of curds and whey. Of what
happened after that accounts vary, but the
general tenor of it was that the young gentlemen
plunged their horses into the pool and, with
great laughter, rounded the practically undressed
girls up on the bank. Then the fun was inter-
rupted by the arrival of three indignant brothers
in moleskin pants and Crimean shirts. These
ruffians immediately attacked the young gentle-
men, pulling them off their horses, kicking and
thumping them, and finally depositing them,
head first, in the musk and water-cress, where
they were nearly smothered with ooze.
Altogether, the young squatters had a disas-
trous time. Several gold-mounted hunting crops

blankets philosophically) : “Ah, well, The Bul-
letin can say what it likes, but there's a usefer

were lost in the musk and mud, oi;e young swell’s
gold watch dropped out of his pocket, and another
was hurled with such force against a willow’ log as
to knock a diamond worth many pounds out c f
its claw-setting.
Battered, sore, and covered with slush and
mud, the young gentlemen made their way on
foot to Oterama station, where the arrival of their
stampeded horses had already announced the fact
that something had happened.
At Studholme Creek indignation was quickly
succeeded by consternation. That Neville Mor-
timer would overlook such a fearful insult was
not believed for a moment, and the cowardly
farmers held a meeting and sent a deputation off
post-haste to apologise and generally cringe. The
young men bitterly opposed the idea, but they
were ignored. They then held a meeting of their
own, and swore to resist arrest by physical force.
At Oterama homestead the farmers grovelled
horribly. The squatter’s terms were simplicity
itself. “Hand over the culprits and all will be
forgiven.” The old men explained that they
couldn’t hand over the ruffians. They were in a
state of rebellion. So Mr. Mortimer started off
with two guests and four men to arrest them,
WAITING FOR HIS EYES!
An hci'jr. later he was back at his homestead,
bathing his face, wilcl2 a huge clod of earth had
struck it. His party had been eiraisSd with pitch-
forks, bombarded with clods, and had actually taiiSll
to flight. By sundown he was back at the settle-
ment with an armed force, had read the Riot Act,
and dug three youths out of a haystack. Next
morning a bench of J’s.P., staying at his house,
committed them to take their trial on several
counts. The other young men who had chased the
squatters’ forces with pitchforks had, so far, not
been arrested. When they were captured, they
got a month to reflect on the advisability of bear-
ing themselves humbly in the presence of those
whom it had pleased God to put in authority over
them.
When the three came up for trial at Christ-
church, it was crusty old Judge Mellion, the son
of a squatter, who glared at them from the Bench.
He took the place of the prosecuting counsel, and
his summing-up was a fearful revelation to the
accused and their friends, who sobbed openly in
court. The jury brought in a verdict of
guilty, with a strong recommendation to mercy
on account of the provocation given. The Judge
brushed that view of the case aside. He had
noticed that there was a growing disposition on
the part of the young men of the lower orders to
take the law into their own hands, and it must be
checked. He thought this spirit of lawlessness
was due to the lack of religious training, and had
noticed that the children on the sheep stations,
where the pastoralists provided religious instruc-
tion, were of a much finer stamp. The time had
come to make a serious stand against these crimes
of violence, and the sentence was that the accused
be imprisoned for a term of six months, and
receive two birchings at the hands of a person to
be appointed to administer the punishment.
A serious uproar ensued. The Judge ordered
the court to be cleared, and adjourned the sittings
to the next day.
Then Christchurch went quite mad. Meetings
were held and frenzied speeches made. The
Judge received a huge mail of threats that he
would be flogged himself if the birching was
carried out; and he referred to the matter in
court, where he wept that he had lived to see a
Judge in a British dependency threatened with
violence for doing his duty. The court jeered,
and was again emptied with violence, after which
his Honor adjourned the sittings till increased
police protection arrived.
That night saw a ferocious pamphlet entitled
“ The Honor of Our Daughters ” distributed. A
committee was formed to work up the agitation,
and a huge crowd began to gather outside the
gaol, which was anything but a fortress. The
Mayor, guarded by a company of mounted police,
read the Riot Act and begged the people to
disperse. They responded with a determined
attack on the gaol. The assault was only repulsed
when the fire brigade pumped tons of cold water
over the besiegers.
The volunteers were called out, and refused to
respond. They were there for the protection of
the country, and not to assist in flogging boys.
The mounted and foot police were quite inade-
quate to maintain order. A crisis had arrived.
Early next evening the streets were filled with
a huge crowd of men and boys all making for the
gaol. Everybody knew that the prisoners were to
be forcibly liberated that night, and behind the
men trooped hundreds of women and girls to see
the fun. But there was a surprise in store.
When from every quarter the people came
pouring to the gaol they found all approaches
blocked by volunteers they had never seen
before—tall men with long, bushy beards
—men who were dressed in blue uniforms,
black leggings, and round forage caps, and
mounted on beautiful horses. There must have
been over a thousand of them round the gaol,
Their swords gleamed in the ruddy light of balls
of kerosened waste burning on steel spikes,
Behind them, like statues in their white uniforms,
their officers sat motionless on jet-black chargers,
It was the army of the Shepherd Kings—the
Canterbury Yeomanry. The Kings had taken the
law into their own hands. Likewise they had
taken Christchurch—or re koned they had.
There was some-
thing impressive about
that pose of silent
might. The crowd
came, saw, and gaped.
Then it silently melted
away. It recognised at
a glance that that
armed gang meant
business. It was known
that Governor Grey
was hurrying as fast
as steam and horse
could bring him, and
if he wanted to smash
the rebel force that had
swept up out of the
ocean of tussock, every
man in Christchurch
would help him. The
question was, how far
away was llori Grey ?
The first flogging was
due on the morrow,
and unless the Pro-
consul came that night
he would come too late.
Crowds of people stood
about the streets and
debated the question
quietly, almost in
whispers.
The squatters felt
uneasy. They did not
appreciate the silent
way the city people
had taken the sudden
appearance of what
to them must have
seemedalmost a foreign
force. A few brickbats
would have relieved
a lot of feeling, and
the pressure of that pent-up passion filled the air
with electric expectancy. It was a cloudy night
of almost velvety darkness —a perfect night for a
sudden surprise, and through the blackness came
distant and unearthly rumblings.
About 2 a.m. a faint drizzle set in, and slowly
increased in volume. Although it made things
•uspleasact-lsr-tbe -ES? bivouacked around the
gaol, the squatters felt relfil' ed. ihcy did no
think the townspeople would rrnt-.i® A hostile
movement in a rainstorm. _ "" -
Suddenly lights appeared in several of the
streets that led to the prison, and there was a
rumbling of carts, a crash of falling metal, and
the sounds of a huge crowd of men working hard.
The squatters reconnoitred, and found squads
of men erecting wooden barricades, and piling
blue metal against them. Explanation came from
a tall man with an air of authority about him,
who informed the officer in command of the
Yeomanry that the authorities were erecting
barricades for the preservation of law and order.
The officer in charge of the Yeomanry explained
that he had heard nothing of it, and it was quite
unnecessary. He was told that the orders of the
authorities must be carried out, and, while he
talked, the street in which they stood was
thoroughly barricaded.
“Besides,” said Colonel Mortimer, “you’ve got
the blamed thing facing the wrong way.”
The tall stranger assured him, in a most winning
manner, that it was facing the right way.
“You have some splendid horses in your force,
Colonel, but I don’t think one of them will get
over the fence we’re building round you. In
another hour you will be hemmed in.”
For the first time it faintly dawned on the
Shepherd Kings that they were not the law.
Already on the top of the completed barricade
there were men with guns watching them. The
Colonel suddenly realised that there was nothing
to prevent him being taken a prisoner. He took
one keen look at the tall stranger, noting every
detail of his features for future identification. It
was a smiling, aristocratic face well-known in
Maoriland later on and not yet quite forgotten,
and the owner said gently:
“Those gentlemen behind the barricade are
laboring under considerable excitement, so per-
haps you had better rejoin your Yeomanry. There
are still two streets to the south unblocked, but
in 25 minutes they will be filled up. And,
Colonel, one of the best evidences of generalship
is ability to recognise when the time has come to
get out with great suddenness. Good morning !”
* * * *
Out through the wider of those streets streamed
the Yeomanry at full gallop. At every window
were faces that jeered them as they rushed past.
From where they started to where the street
straggled out among the detached houses and
gardens they saw no sign of carts loaded with
materials for barricades. A horrible suspicion
seized the Colonel that he had been bluffed ; but,
anyhow, his horsemen would have no show in that
trap once shooting started. Outside they could
defy the city rats.
They slowed down to a trot, then to a walk,
and once out where the rising sun fell on the
shimmering tussocks the Shepherd Kings felt
secure once more. They held a council of war.
Hot bloods were for returning, but the horse sense
of Job Jenkins, who called himself Mortimer,
carried the point. He remembered the advice of
the tall man with the sardonic eyes and pleasant,
smiling face. He had got out, and, damn it, he
would stay out.
That evening he learned, with a shock, that
Governor Grey was in the city, and had pardoned
and released the boys from Studholme Creek.
The said boys were being entertained on a scale
of magnificence that was really dangerous to their
health. And then Job Jenkins thought of the
tall man with the winning smile, who had scat-
tered the army of the Kings with a mere word.
The Yeomanry went back to their homes, and
told wonderful tales to admiring wives and
children of how the crowd came surging up
through the ruddy light of burning waste, gazed
on them a moment, and then melted away in
sudden fear. Of that wild rush of panic-stricken,
mud-splashed men through the pouring rain, led
by a fat squatter fleeing on a great black charger,
they said never a word. But, no doubt, being
mostly imaginative men, it haunted them sorely.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE crescent moon and clock tower are fair
above the wall—
Across the smothered Lanes of ’Loo, the
stifled vice and all,
And in the shadow yonder—like cats that wail for
scraps—
The crowding cabs seem waiting—for you and me,
perhaps.
The cab lamps are watching, as they watched for
you and me;
The cab lamps are watching, and they watch

The sea breeze in Macleay-street, and star-angels
over all;
But the slinking cabs of darkness keep their
watch beside the wall.
Oh ! the years we slipped like months, and the
months like a day,
When our cabs slid from the stand, touched the
kerb, and sped away.
Oh ! the cloak on girlish shoulders —Oh ! the
theatres and light !
And the private rooms and suppers that were all
in a night !
Oh ! the rickshaw in Colombo !—And the flat that
no one knew,
Where the cab lamps watched Haymarket—
London cabs for me and you.
Oh ! the gay run “Home” by Paris when the
world was ours to play,
And. the wild run back by ’Frisco, that seems all

Oh ! the rose lamps and rose curtains, when the lie
called love seemed true—
While an honest wife and husband suffered by the

Oh ! the health, and strength, and beauty, and
the money with its power—
And those two good lives we ruined that was all

And he’d shift us “ quick and lively ” to the sweet

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IDO in some sort envy these English
writers who are never burdened with
materials; who begin with a knowledge of a
kailyard village or a hamlet in Devon, and get
their 20 books out of these thin experiences. It
is this sort of novelist who, at the beginning of
his career, writes a book titled “Jean o’ the
Brose,” and 25 years later writes it again as
“Clambering Woodbine.” It is all very sweet
and unnatural, and the discriminating critic
writes in big letters that “Art is selection,” and
praises the author of “Clambering Woodbine”
for his “ selection ” of everything he had. This
natural weakness, disguising itself as “ reticence,”
“ repose,” “ reserved strength ’’—any of the cant
terms which cults and sham enthusiasts invent to
explain and apologise for themselves—is the thing
critics respect because it isn’t immediately under-
standable. The man who is continuously and
indiscriminatingly giving away his strength must
be stronger than the cold, statuesque, reserved,
Englishman of the Englishly-written novel, who
loses his temper once in a century, butwhenhedoes
lose it, loses it indeed, and becomes baresark—
Hercules, Goliath, and their peer—the English-
man of the Surrey side melodrama. The cold,
calm man with the reserve strength shown once
in a lifetime is by that fact proved to have been
possessed of only sufficient strength to act once
in a lifetime. Irvine, the cold, calm painted lath of
Victorian politics, is the “strong, silent English-
man” incarnate.
Well, these cold, strong, reserved, reticent
literary artists of England get their reputation
and advertisement of the critics on false pre-
tences ; their alleged strength being largely weak-
ness, their reserve being mainly limitation of
experience, their reticence mostly ignorance.
Like all little men, they can pad and trim and
equivocate, and talk the matter of 1000 words
into 90,000. At the beginning they dolly their
little leader, and old age finds them cyanidingthe
tailings.
There is more fun in leaving old half-ounce
diggings, and finding even new duffers, than in
following the example of the hatter. Those
icy men have just sufficient strength to
stay behind and fossick the dumps which
the better men raised—washing dirt worth
only five grains a yard ; gentle and pathetic
figures, even as the busted Earl who sells his
daughter in the Family Herald.
Yet for all practical purposes, and especially
in a community that likes life beaten out as thin
as a George Reid speech, these strong, reticent,
and reserved pap-manufacturers have the pull.
Their outlook is never confused, because there are
few objects in their vision. Consider the mental
jumble of the man of the full-blooded life who
tries to serve both God and Mammon—to write
the things that are kicking in his brain, and yet
whose other Ego drives him to chase new rushes
and try to make big money. He who would be
rich must turn his back on God. Nothing truer,
AT HEAVEN'S GATE.

reading for “ God ” the work you like, the hobby
you have, the sacred thing you must do, and that
without the wish for gain.
In the last five years of life—the only really
thoughtful years I have ever known—the habit
has been to pile up experience on experience; to
add material to material; and the results of the
habit increase at such a rate that I cannot write
even such a selection of it as will represent “Art”
in less than the space of two lifetimes. Yet there
it all is—the memory of the trivial sensation as
bright and clear as if it were an importance which
happened yesterday. How they crowd on one
another—the river steamer, and the shambles ;
the blacksmith’s forge, the ship painting in Mort’s
Dock, the rabbiting, the solicitor’s office, the
entering room in the dry goods store, my first
newspaper, early Broken Hill, Zeehan and Cool-
gardie, the Fitzroy Gardens and the Boboli, Pichi
Hichi Pass and Napoleon’s Arch of Peace at
Milan, the Yendome Column and Chambers
Pillar, the Monument on Fish-street Hill and
the Leaning Rock of Chillagoe, and the waiting
for a ship at Esperance, and the being
flood bound at Fossilbrook ; twenty leagues of
amaranth west and south of Southern Cross, the fire
flies in the oranges behind Cairns, and half-a-mile
of iris below the battlements of Monte Pesceni, in
Tuscany in May ; twenty acres of blackwood
blossom by Mount Fatigue, and a peach tree in
the Swiss Alps, casting a pink glare upon the snow.
And then Martin Walsh and Sailor Bill, and Oliver
Page and Jim Wilkinson, and ten thousand
other men ; the most beautiful woman in
the world, who sits in the fish-market of
Venice, and scales fish alive; the cypresses
on Bellosguardo, the peacocks at Cagliari;
the tunny fishing at Isola San Pietro, south
of Sardinia; the House of the Moon, kept
by Ponce de Leon to this day, on the Novara-
road to Mount Etna; that Chamberlain of the
Vatican, clothed from top to toe in scarlet,
tripping through those arching corridors of marble
on his flamingo legs; and the old woman who
danced with me a saraband in Fleet-street. And
what more—Fidelina, who washes pots at Santa
Fiora still, and on whom be peace; Ernesto,
Ergenida and Terrizzetta of Casale de Pari, and
the misfortunate village beauty who was, alas !
“ Promessa, ma non sposata” ; a big buffalo bull
in his blue wallow looking curiously at the gun
for a minute before he went mad with fear, and
the young bull who was shot through the spine,
and begged, as any man might do, for another
bullet; the pearl diver, paralysed by diving in
thirty-fathom water; Frank Lee and Jack
Rossitter, and the picture book scenery
of the Straits ; the humors of the mine
I didn’t float in Glasgow ; the falling crash of the
last pepper-tree I felled in Grey-street ; the
spear-grass of Nor’-west Queensland, suggesting
the idiotic crowd of Regent-street, which was a
moving pin-cushion of umbrellas, held like lances,
last time I saw it; Museum-street, and the
piano-organist coming nightly from Drury Lane
to play “ The Old Bull and Bush ” ; the clean
camp at the Pink Lake, Avith the condenser
spinning salt like new wool from every leak ; Jim
and Broadcourt flats ; Herbert and Exeter Hall,
and the Mission to Deep-sea Fishermen ; old Box
o’ Tricks in Tottenham Court-road ; and Misery,
Brophy’s camel, that died of poison-bush. And
then a procession of dead men and women and
horses, and in a moment they have gone and
there is another jumble—full as the first, but new
in everything.
I felt the pleasant oppression of these memo-
ries most keenly, the other day, after weeks
crammed—every day of them—with new sensa-
tions. And then came a time when physical weari-
ness absolutely deadened all but the business
kind of intelligence required at the moment.
After scrambling for thirty days up and down
mad ranges of mica schist and spinifex, leading
horses up hills like gable ends, and leaving them
where the country was all length and edge
without breadth, and only that marvellously
adaptable animal, Man, could find a foothold, we
made to the splintered, riven flats of the Corella.
The pack-horse had pig-jumped over the broken
country for seven days, and churned into mush
the little tin of sardines which represented the
last day’s tucker. With light heads and empty
stomachs we had come on a deserted camp in
hills of limestone at noon, and there had found
some ancient beef, which, two hours after eating,
proved to be mostly cadaveric alkaloids; and then
an emetic (of a kind) left me empty again, but safe.
The buggy and its welcome tucker came in sight
at dusk, and all next day I loafed luxuriously, as
the rested buggy horses drew me through the dust
to Duck Creek and the Cloncurry Road.
Loafing so after that time of enjoyable stress
was such a contrast that the brain, brutalised
out of action by hard physical work, became
keener than ever; and racing through the grey gum
flats, and over the hard iron-strewn rises, I was
fey, and saw that empty bush crowded and full of
life.
At the beginning of this hard work my note-
book was a tangle of lucid mining measurements
and values, that had abruptly introduced to them
some little note of character, some touch of man,
horse, dog, or bird nature, some natural fact that
had come as new to me as a spring day to a child
after winter or after an illness. There is the pecu-
liar feeling as of coming ashore from a long
voyage, when you walk in hobnailed boots
on a boarded floor after a fortnight’s scaling of
mountains of rolling stones, and of struggling
through yielding sand—the panorama in the
ranges above the Wee Macgregor so lofty that
we startled the eagles; the sun sinking in those
break-neck hills and a sickly moon rising to light
us over the twelve miles through trackless wastes
ot rolling stones back to the camp at the Springs ;
tne moonlit ride itself down to the flats, through
creeks of scented broom ; by spears and quintains
I turpentine wood, which lie privily in wait to
i j r -t’he after luxury, by contrast, of
hard beef and dry damper, and the change to Bal-
morals after sixteen hours of hot leggings and
heavy cossack boots, almost equal in weight to
™ e which crippled the English troops in South
Africa the hacking moan of the dingo, kept
by man’s presence from the water, and cryinar
his desolation to the night; the quail, booming and
whirring as the horses stumbled with us through
the tussocks in the dark; the copper teamsters,
doing the impossible with waggons, and going over
wall-steep hills ; the water at the Springs, fouled
by camels, and with that strange, tarry taste
which is camel sweat and every other abomination.
And all these things, and the million new things
each one of these things suggests, finally get
theniselves identified with the names of books that
snail be one day—all of them ; an’ the Lord give
me grace to live a hundred years. They come,
these books, in fancy all complete, and prevent
their own birth by jostling each other, and making
me discontent with the very little I have done.
That scene should have been in “ Sops of Wine ”
T7~ . No—this— well, the other; that belongs to
Rainbow Gold,” and that to “The Greater
Barns, ” and that again to ‘ ‘ The Flame of Youth,”
and still that one to “ The Ships of Shame.” And
all the books are intermixed and tangled, and yet
gettiner themselves done while seemingly neglected;
for all these unsorted memories are part of them,
and each shall marshal himself in his own place,
once the roll is ready to be called.
was the camp by the brumby yard near
West Leichhardt, and the wild cattle that moaned
all night because our fire blocked their way to
water ; the mad ranges from Charlie’s Creek; the
garrulous water packer at the Secret; the old
miner who had heard that all Bulletin writers
were atheists, and that two of every three of them
ended by suicide; the three youngsters who
cheerfully began the making of 20 miles of road
in broken country, so that they might get their ore
to market; the windy camp at Cameron’s Creek ;
the little round man who was never tired, and who
called a “tour” a “tower-ri,” and quartz “white
oxide ” ; the self-starvation of the last days, the
recalcitrant pack horse, the white gums in the
moonlit creek—chaste, cold, decisive, like marble
pillars in a Pagan temple. There is the little
plain where fifty camels knelt as if reverently to
the East, between their loads —lachrymose, out of
the time, and belonging to the dawn of man’s
world ; their turbaned, dirty, priestly Afghans
moving between these rows of Sons of Shaitan and
consecrating them with burdens; the two Men-
who-Would-be-Rich-in-a-Hurry, and who asked
£6OOO cash for a hat-full of ore and two copper
stains pegged yesterday; the man who hunted
* r oxide of titanium, and would have nothing
else; the ex-stockman, who sneered at bullocks
and praised copper without ceasing; the black
near-sider, who had been a racehorse just fast
enough to lose men’s money ; the galahs, like
modest ladies in grey and pink, and voiced as
raucously as drunken fish-fags; the riding sud-
denly on to a camp of camels, and my horse
taking charge of the expedition in his fear, and
bolting through the scrub trying to tear me into
shreds among the turpentine ; the panther dog at
the gorge, who had to be fastened with trace-
links because, like the lion of Judah, he broke
every chain; those jays which are called the
Twelve Apostles, and which cry unceasing “ Tick-
a-taclc—l’ll hide—there’s copper,” and are popu-
larly supposed to divide the working day into
three shifts, so that the chatter may never stop
while the sun shines ; and the girl who knew the
sound of her sister’s horse-bell among a score—all
not of much value, until human interest is
extended or added to them.
Men and dogs and horses and birds and scenes
and peoples and things I saw defile before me
through the bush, hungry for selection, jostling
each other and trying to be born. And, tangling
them all, dreams of the 800k —The Book which
shall be done one day; and is even now alive,
though meshed in its cocoon, almost vocal, but
still stammering in its shard.

LIGHTS o’ London, blurring soft
Yellow blots along the fog,
See the lean ’bus-horses jog
And the crowded fares aloft,
Rugg’d and coated, ruddy-skinned,
Shiver in the icy wind.
Here a street-lamp spills its light
Shining on the muddy way ;
Here you oft in broadest day
Find the light-starred mirk of night,
Flashed across with fiery blurs
From the wide-mouthed theatres.
Windows gleam from tall hotels,
Fruit stalls flash by torches’ flare,
Grinding motors slacken, ’ware
Of trim blue-coated sentinels
Steadying this hurrying throng
All day through and all night long.
All day long the hurrying feet
Pass trim rows of smiling shops,
Where the droning beggar stops
To find foul supper in the street,
Where silk hats gleam and broughams go by,
Gay with gowns and livery.
A drab-dressed orange-woman bawls,
Some melancholy organ blares,
Shrill-voiced newsboys cry their wares,
And midst the stir, at intervals
In smoky clouds, from underneath
The railways vomit up hot breath.
Overhead the humming wires,
Throbbing engines underground ;
Rhythmic ring the pavements round
With even beat that never tires—
Even beat that dies not down.
There’s no rest in London town,
Lights o’ London, blurring, dull,
Yellow blots across the night,
Hearken how the rhythmic might
Swells her pulses strong and full!
London’s heart-beat is the throe
Of some enormous dynamo.

The Witches.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
WHEN I went out to gather seed
That ripens on the sleepy weed,
I met five witches in the mead.
The first flew ’thwart the setting sun.
‘ Whither,” I questioned, “ do you run ? ”
“ To make the bed of the Evil One 1 ”
I asked the second, hurrying quick,
Whither she rode on crooked stick.
“ To lay the board for old Father Nick ! ”
The third was wrinkled, old and thin,
Like a sheaf of bones in a bag of skin.
She said, “I gather souls for Sin 1 ”
The fourth hag cried : “I go to scrub,
With brimstone soap, at a sulphur tub.
In the reeking house of Beelzebub ! ”
The fifth went by with shrouded head ;
She walked with faltering, fearful tread.
“What is your duty, witch ?” I said.
She raised a face that was sweet and wise.
I looked in two mournful stars of eyes.
“ You, too, are not thrall to the Lord of Lies? ”
As though in storms of sorrow wrung,
Down on the earth her form she flung
(It looked so lithe, and soft, and young).
From where her sisters fretted near,
Those withered crones—old, grim and sere,
Derisive laughter struck my ear.
I left the witches in the mead
And went my way to seek the seed
That grows upon the sleepy weed.

Powiri's Home-coming.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
WHEN Powiri returned to the pah
he was not recognised.
Eight years before, the missionary,
toiling amongst his brown people, had dispatched
Powiri to the Mahaki Maori College, and there
he stayed, imbibing a certain amount of know-
ledge, aping the pakeha’s manner and dress, and
considering himself no end of a buck. During
the eight years of Powiri’s absence the missionary
worked wonders at the pah. He roused the men
from their sloth, and set them preparing the
ground for the kumara crop. He went in and
about the whares, advising repairs here or rebuild-
ing there. He gave the “ heathen ” a dim idea of
sanitation as the white man understands it. He
toiled with his people—helping fat Tame repair
his roof, and lazy Pitiki dig his kumara patch—
and he exhorted them, and he put a great fear of
the Rev. Elias Ewan into the hearts of the brown
brother. Big Billy Hapu found, after a week’s
exhortation, that it was easier to work than listen
to the Rev. Elias' rasping voice, and with many a
groan Billy waddled off to the eel-weir, where he
persistently got in the way of the hard-working—
—hard-working, that is, as Maoris go—Urumu
and his son. Billy’s idea of work was very vague.
Later, when the railway formation was started at
Uenuku, the Rev. Elias drove a batch of picked
men to hew and shovel, and when the shearing
started, all who could handle shears were dis-
patched to neighboring stations to wrestle with
the active jumbuck and earn a cheque.
Then, having time to look around, the Rev.
Elias Ewan founded a school, and put his nephew
in charge, and started a football club. The game
generally lasted past midnight, and the yells of
the players could be heard for miles. Also the
reverend toiler devised a Mutual Improvement
Society, and a Sewing Bee, and a Tea and Bun
Club, and did many other things to civilise the
Maori.
But at the back of the missionary’s brain there
lay his Great Idea, which would eventuate when
little Powiri came back to the pah, refined and
educated, ready to lead his more ignorant brothers
in the straight and narrow path. He had chosen
Powiri from a heap of squirming, dirty youngsters
on account of his gentle disposition and finely-
chiselled features, for there was little of the
Maori about Powiri—at least, during his earlier
years. And the missionary toiled and drove his
flock by main force, and was successful with the
moderate success that is possible where the Maori
is concerned, and his brother missionaries envied
him his achievements and his people. But, most
of all, they envied him Powiri, who was to come
back and lead the Maori to salvation.
Then, one morning, old Marama, who was the
one connecting link with civilisation, drove up in
his spring-cart, and deposited a huge, glorified
native at the pah gate, and having helped the
stranger unload two portmanteaux, a dress-basket,
and a hat-box, drove off again into the bush. The
stranger, who stood over 6ft. high and weighed
quite 17st., was dressed in a gay check suit, tan
boots, and a panama hat. He carried a silk um-
brella. Round his hat was wound a red silk
handkerchief; across his massive chest hung a
magnificent “gold ” chain ; and between his thick
lips was balanced a rank cigar. Little Powiri
was home again.
The Maoris gathered round the wanderer in
scores, but that magnificent person scarcely
deigned to notice them, except to order a couple
of youngsters to carry the two portmanteaux to
the whare of Powiri Petane, his father. The
dress-basket and the hat-box Powiri carried him-
self.
The Rev. Elias Ewan, on hearing the news,
hurried to Petane’s whare to welcome his pro-
tege. Inside the whare Powiri, seated amid a
circle of admiring cousins, uncles and aunts, was
just broaching a third bottle of waipiro, whilst
the dress-basket, containing half-a-dozen more
bottles, lay at his knee. One glance staggered
the Rev. Elias, and he rushed away to regain his
strength by meditation and much searching of
the soul.
When the waipiro was finished, Powiri sent
two of his admirers to the bush pub—a good 12
miles’ ride —for a further supply ; and settled down
to give an account of his doings during the pre-
AN OBLIGING ELECTOR.
“ Mr. Chairman, sorr, I would like to ax the candidate a quistion. And the quistion I would
like to ax is this: 'I s there any quistion that the candidate has not yet been axed that
he would like to answer?"
vious eight years. The Maori is a very flowery
speaker, the commonest facts being embellished
out of all recognition, and Powiri, with his know-
ledge of three languages and his vast experience,
should have held liisaudience spellbound for hours,
whilst the Rev. Elias Ewan wrestled in prayer
close by. But Powiri was only eloquent when
describing race-meetings he had seen and billiard
matches he had engaged in. He was particu-
larly eloquent on the subject of a trip to Sydney
which he had made with the college football
team, and during which many things besides foot-
ball had happened. This item was very popular
with his hearers. Then, amidst much yelling, the
waipiro carriers returned, and the crowd moved
to the big meeting-house in the centre of the
kainga, where Powiri again related his experiences,
and where the air was so hot that everyone was
bathed in perspiration. Then old Powiri Petane,
tattooed and gaunt, hereditary rangitira of the
Maniapotos, led the haka, and the Rev. Elias
Ewan shuddered in his bed.
Towards morning Powiri produced several packs
of cards, and proceeded to initiate his friends in
the mysteries of nap. They played all the next
day and night, and the next, and the next, and
when the Rev. Elias Ewan pleaded or threatened,
Powiri damned him loudly, and called him an
aged specimen of the animal introduced by Cap-
tain Cook, and the natives cheered lustily and
revolted against the man who had driven them to
make roads and shear jumbucks.
Then, because he had lost all his possessions to
Powiri, Ropata Hapuka half-killed his wahine
with a large manuka switch, and the Rev. Elias
rode hot-haste to Gisborne for a policeman. But
when he returned with a very sulky half-caste
trooper in tow, the Maoris swore that his story
was a “ plurry lie,” and Hapuka’s wahine, at the
instance of the drunk and humorous Powiri, gave
him in charge for assault and battery ; so that the
Rev. Elias returned to Gisborne a prisoner. Then
all the Maoris who could be spared from the card-
playing repaired to Gisborne, and solemnly tes-
tified in court that the rev. gentleman was many
things.
The magistrate did not believe them, but
neither did he like the Rev. Elias. He objected
to have the country rooted up by an energetic
raucous missionary. He foresaw trouble now that
Elias had brought into the district an educated
list, devil to devastate the pahs with nap and
billiard yarns. He was wholly convinced that
buzzing philanthropists should be put down. So
he wore a grim countenance, and said that it was
fortunate for the prisoner that he seemed to have
no previous convictions. The Rev. Elias Ewan
was discharged with a severe admonition, and on
payment of costs, and went out bursting with
indignation.
When he arrived back at the pah he was met at
the gate by Powiri, now dressed only in the tan
boots and a mat. He was informed that Powiri
owned the pah, having won everything at nap,
and that he, Rev. Elias Ewan, had better get.
For once the missionary was wise. He got.
MAORI MAC.
Agincourt Alley—Shooting
the Moon.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
ALL day long there had been a spirit of
restlessness about Mr. Delaney—a rest-
lessness which even repeated visits to
the Clove and Onions had been powerless to
quell. He hung around his home smoking
furiously, and eyed the world in general with
furtive and suspicious regard.
But with the dark came action. When night
flung her starry mantle around the bareness and
squalor of Agincourt Alley, and enticing odors
of evening meal made themselves felt on the still
air, Mr. Delaney rose to the occasion as the de-
layed planet lifts itself above the horizon, and
strode off into the darkness with an air of deter-
mination such as one would look for on the face
of a soldier the night before the battle, or of a
boy about to take castor oil.
He reappeared later in the company of another
man, a large van and a very small horse.
Quietly, very quietly, they urged the animal
(whose front knees tended to a devotional atti-
tude) along the alley, and backed it to the back-
yard gate of Mr. Delaney’s residence.
Then began a procession between the house and
the van.
First came Mr. Delaney and friend conducting
a bedstead. The kitchen table followed, with
two young Delaneys at each end and one under-
neath. Mrs. Delaney struggled single-handed
with the twins’ cot. Miss D. found an armful of
crockery a hard nut to crack, but, by perseverance,
she not only cracked the lot, but smashed it into
small fragments.
The noise of the crash and of her parents’ sub-
sequent remarks roused the echoes and the neigh-
boring dogs. But when it was found that the
noise had not attracted too much undesired notice
to their affairs, the procession re-commenced. It
was an impressive sight. It conjured up visions
of the ancient Israelites preparing to leave-take
the land of Egypt.
Such was the activity of all, that in half-an-
hour the bulk of the Delaney house goods were
piled safely on the van.
All was going well when Miss Murphy’s un-
prepossessing head appeared over the next door
VISIONS OF THE NIGHT.
DRUNK (anticipating): “I know, pleeshman, you gum' ask why (hie) dogsh ain’t registered.
But I (hie) 'sure you they don't b'long to me. Fac’ is, theysh follered me home from club.”
fence. (Miss M. was Mrs. D.’s bitterest enemy
ever since a little breeze over a borrowed sauce-
pan.) Miss Murphy surveyed the busy scene
and sniffed. Miss Murphy’s sniff was eloquent—
it was chilling. Everyone stood still as if frozen.
The dense silence was only broken by Delaney’s
low muttered remarks, which disturbed the
delightful but fanciful dreams of a square feed,
which the horse was enjoying as it reclined
against the shafts, and recalled that attenuated
animal to a sense of its suffering existence. It
shook itself sorrowfully, and sniffed the roadway
as if it expected to find the dream come true.
It was disappointed.
“Hum !” remarked Miss Murphy, raising her-
self above the fence to get a better view. “ Hum ! ”
she repeated. ‘ ‘ Moving ? ”
“ Movin’ ?” said Mr. Delaney slowly, in a voice
of wonder. “Movin’? No! Picked up a few
odds and ends at a sale, and we be jist after
shiftin’ ov ’em in.” He moved slowly back to the
house with an air of desperation and the bundle
of assorted domestic utensils he had been j ust in the
act of placing on the van. Slowly, sadly, the pro-
cession reversed itself under the eagle eye and
nimble tongue of the delighted Miss Murphy.
Nor was it till the last stick had been removed
from the van that she left her post. “Goo’ ni’
to yez,” she said in. loud, cheerful tones. “I’ll
drop in in the marnin’ an’ see the noo fer’niturs.”
“ May yer drap dead, y’ onnat’ral ——! ! ”
but the rest of Mr. Delaney’s whispered remarks
were unprintable. He relieved his feelings in
some measure by more language and by rushing
at the dog, and told his friend to come back at
2 o’clock and try again. The friend went to the
van, awoke the horse, and drove away, passing
unkind remarks on Mr. Delaney’s powers of
organisation.
At 2.15 a.m. he reappeared with his van. This
time the wheels were swathed in bandages, so
that the vehicle moved like a rubber-tyred han-
som, while over each foot the creature in the
shafts wore a pillow—to its great surprise and in-
convenience. For a long time it could not get to
sleep for thinking of them.
The work began anew, and this time success
seemed to be the reward of effort. The last rope
had been adjusted ; Mrs. D. and family were
safely stowed inside ; two cats were the only sign
of life about, and Mr. Delaney and friend were
just about to wake the horse and start on their
pilgrimage, when ——
From the next door yard came a rich voice
softly carolling “Won’t yah come-a ’ome, Bill
Bailey?” and, at the self-same moment, from out
the darkness emerged the corpulent form of
“Fatty” Beaver, the rent-collector. In the
background loomed the figures of Mr. and Miss
Murphy. Mr. Delaney groaned.
“Good evenin’,” said the collector, suavely.
“ I ’eard y’ was a-goin’ to move, so I come along
to see if you wanted a hand. We’re sorry to lose
sich a good tenant —an’ so sudden, too.”
Mr. Delaney breathed heavily.
“I don’t like to worrit y’with trifles when I
see y’re busy,” resumed the collector, “ but there’s
a little matter o’ £4 15s. fid. outstandin’ fer rent.
If y’ could see yo’ way to let me ’ave it now, it’d
save me callin’ at yo’ noo residence. ”
“I—l posted it to yez,” began Mr. Delaney,
desperately.
The collector’s smile made itself felt through
the darkness.
“Come, come !” he remonstrated gently.
“ Well, I ain’t got it,” said Delaney sulkily.
“ That’s awkward !” mused “Fatty.”
“Will yez take ther mangle at the back there?”
inquired Delaney.
A few frenzied words whispered into his friend’s
ear caused that gentleman to climb quietly and
unobtrusively on to the box. Delaney and the
collector adjourned to the back.
“Will yez take ther mangle?” repeated
Delaney.
The collector eyed it disparagingly.
“No, I won’t !” he said decidedly.
“Then take that,” exclaimed Delaney, with
sudden activity.
“Fatty ” Beaver was settled. He sat in the
gutter nursing his nose and groaning loudly as he
watched the swaying van disappear into the dark-
ness.
With Herculean effort, Mr. Delaney struggled
across his family and furniture, and took his stand
beside the driver, whom he assisted (with a bed-
post) to encourage the horse.
At the entrance to the alley two figures jumped
up in the roadway. They were the collector’s
assistants.
“ Stop !” they shouted.
On came the van, swaying and lurching, right
on top of them. The excited horses’ widely-
thrown, pillow-encased feet caught one in the
chest and hurled him into a tree-guard, where In
hung suspended. The other narrowly escaped a
similar fate, but with indomitable courage he gave
chase. A wild race followed. But four pillows,
an overladen van and want of condition seriously
handicapped the horse. The man rapidly drew
up. “ St-t-o-p !” he panted.
Then Master Delaney rose unsteadily to his
feet in the swaying van, crawled to the tail-board,
and balanced there. His arm drew back, then
shot forward. A flash, a crash, a shriek, and the
collector’s assistant was left far behind in the
roadway, extracting pieces of broken soup-dish
from his person. The enemy was vanquished.
They drove on for half an hour. Then the horse
stopped and lay down.
“We’re safe,” said Mr. Delaney, shouting at
the top of his voice, so as to be heard above the
breathing of the horse. “They’re beat.”
“Wot sorter shot am I?” inquired Master
Delaney, modestly.
“Ye air ther limit,” said his father, proudly.
“I ’opes ut wuz ther dish wid the crack in ut,”
said his mother, anxiously.
After a long spell the horse was persuaded to
rise and proceed.
Luckily, there was not much further to go, for
the steed lay down in the shafts every hundred
yards and rested. It was not till the dawn was
breaking that they reached their new home in
a far-distant suburb. Fortune had favored the
brave. The Delaneys had shot the moon.”

A TRIUMPH OF FOOLS
FOR THE BULLETIN.
NOW and then there are days when I gasp in amaze
At the millions of things I don't know:
All the laws and the lore of the elderly bore.
And the way people say I should “ go ” ;
My “ ambition in life ” and “ my part in the strife.
And the “ state of my soul,” and my prayers
(Which I always did say in a furious way
After chasing the tom cat upstairs).
Leader writers may sneer, they may blackguard and jeer,
But I never will ballot or vote.
And the dull daily news I refuse to peruse,
But I mourn the decease of the Tote.
Then I hate solid facts and Commandments and Acts.
And my mind is in ignorance draped.
Oh ! I never feel glum when I add up the sum
Of the knowledge that I have escaped 1
There is too much to learn, and I cheerfully spurn
All the foggy old systems and rules,
But I always feel gay when I hear the loud bray
Of an ass, or the chatter of fools.
And all botches and fakes, also stupid mistakes
I collect and remember for years
And I always say “ Fudge ” to a dignified judge,
But an archbishop drives me to beer.
Then it fills me with gloom when some people assume
That I’m thirsting to have things explained,
And they’re ready to drop when I tell them to stop, tl
And they always look terribly pained; k
For they can’t comprehend like an intimate friend, *
So the front door they savagely slam.
And, although they keep cool, they conclude I’m a fool/”
And I daresay that’s just what I am.
Then I hate above all to be jammed in a hall
Where it’s dark and they lecture on food,
And a man shows a slide of an awful inside
(Which I think is uncalled for and rude).
And I think it is low, and I don’t want to know
How much blood is inside of me stored;
So I loudly call “ Shame,” and someone does the same,
And my conduct is greatly deplored.
The quotation’s a beast 1 don’t like in the least,
For all riddles I think are accurst;
And I reach for my hat, when they ask, “ Who says that ?
Is it Hamlet, or Richard the First ? ”
For I don’t care a jot if he said it or not,
And I won’t take a book from the shelf,
And 1 simply won't fill up my brains with old Bill
When I’ve done so much better myself.
I hate people with views, who give each man his dues,
Arid pay rates and go early to bed ;
And who love tea and toast, and send tracts by the post,
And “ are sure that I’ve been badly led.”
I defy all their prayers, and I’ll throw them downstairs
(I would do it with infinite glee !),
For if I contrive at the dogs to arrive,
Then the credit is all due to me,
Oh ! the sight of a seer always moves me to jeer,
But I honor the maker of Mirth ;
And all logic and sense I throw over the fence,
And I mock all the great of the earth.
For when Autumn comes round 1 may often be found
'Neath a hedge, where I merrily sing;
Or 1 sit like an owl till I rise with a howl,
And throw turnips and clods at a King.
Let the ass have no fear—give me hold of his ear,
Link the arm of the jester in mine,
And we three that are kin, we will go forth and win,
As we must when we gaily combine.
And each eminent sage will fall down in a rage.
And gkim Christians will burst in the street,
And the wise will uprise with a snort of surprise
When the triumph of fools is complete.

KODAK.


“Fact'ry ’Ands.”
THE RIVALS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
JINNY BlTT—known as Thripny—was
going on for sixteen, too tall for her age
and her width and her wearing apparel.
Her shins were so thin they seemed to have a
cutting edge, and there was too much of them
visible, although the frayed, stained and faded
skirt was let down so far in the hope of covering
the deficiency that a wide gap existed between it
and the skimpy body part of her costume, where
a quantity of dun-colored underclothing pro-
truded. Her arms, too, were long and thin ;so
was her neck. The long, thin arms came far out
of her tight sleeves, always worn at th® elbow and
torn in the armpit. The long, thin neck was sur-
mounted by a very small head decorated with
pale, drab-tinted hair that had been cropped
within the year, and was now about a span in
length, and amenable to no kind of treatment.
It writhed like shrivelled pea-pods, and Miss Bitt
thought it was curly. Jinny wore a bit of stale
red ribbon awkwardly knotted in the middle of
her swan-like neck, but she was not a girl who
put forth any pretensions to style. Her boots
were heelless, and their symmetry had been
destroyed by bigger feet. Her stockings had
many holes. The hat she wore had been a
“gem’’in its day and generation, but most of
the rim was nibbled off by the rats and cock-
roaches abounding on the factory flat, and its only
ornaments were a bootlace and a large brass
button. Miss Bitt might have picked up a better
hat any day anywhere, but she seemed cheerfully
unconscious of this one’s imperfections.
“Thripny looks ez if she was made iv elastic,
>n’ then stretched,” said the packer, and the
description was apt.
Coffee Morgan was Miss Bitt’s cobber. She
was a girl of about the same age, shorter, and
fleshy in an unhealthy way. She owed her nick-
name to her prevailing tone. Her hair might have
been bright red under more favorable conditions,
but she oiled it liberally, and it collected the
factory dust, and assumed the tint of ground
coffee. Her complexion was like coffee milked,
and her disposition was morose. Miss Morgan
dressed rather better than Miss Bitt, but the
Beauties soon discovered that her new dresses
were always made of second-hand material, and
her latest hats were at least a generation too old
for the girl, and had evidently come down to her
after seeing long service. From the fact that all
her dresses were coffee-colored, the Beauties
rashly concluded that her grandmother was a
“ Beardie,” a brown sect closely allied to Quakers.
Nearly all the Beauties paired off. Their mate-
ships were close, affectionate, and to some extent
secretive. Once the alliance was formed, and
while it lasted, the two friends seemed to cherish
identical tastes, appetites, and desires. The
characteristic is not peculiar to factory hands ; it
is noticeable in a young ladies’ seminary. This
intimacy of Thripny and Coffee Morgan was more
quaint than another, because of Thripny’s length
and leanness, and Miss Morgan’s shortness and
shapelessness, and for the reason that Thripny
had the ungainly sprightliness of a half-grown ,
Newfoundland pup, while
her cobber was slow,
weighty, and de-
pressed in man-
ner. Miss Bitt
was shrill and
voluble ; Miss
Morgan talked
little, and then in
a low, mumbling
tone, and with an
aggrieved air, as
if resenting the
task.
The two were
typical of the
younger hands
from the slum
suburbs. T hey
served in the
lower branches of
the game, and
were still novices.
With experience
and increase of
income would
come something
like a sense of
decorum, and a
passion for fine
raiment and brass
bangles; but as yet
Thripny was an undis-
ciplined rapscallion of a
girl, street-bred, uncon-
scious, and with no more
restraint than the unowned,
shambling, jubilant mongrel you
may see brazenly claiming acquaint-
ance with elegant young ladies in public places.
Turned loose from Spats’, she tore down Egg
Lane, her bony knees tossing up her sparse
petticoats, her left hand hitching some detached
or displaced portion of apparel, her right clutch-
ing her battered sugee crib basket, her scrap of a
hat dangling from the bootlace, one end of which
she always chewed as a precaution against high
winds or casual mishaps. Now and again she
might look back in her wild career and shout :
“ Come’long, Mordie, here’s er jinker!” And
Miss Morgan, a bad second, would paddle be-
hind, displaying no manner of interest in any-
thing. The grease-grimed lads at the egg, ham,
and butter market looked out for Ihripny, and
whooped at her as she passed. The grimier
young men in the potato depot assailed her with
joyful badinage. Miss Bitt’s troubles-she was
bent on catching the first jinker or lorry for home
at the Port, and had time only for a breathless
“ Ga-an, get work ! ” which was no more than the
civilities demanded.
If it happened to be a timber jinker, Thripny
dashed at the protruding beam behind, and
scrambled astride, excited and voluble, shoutiug
encouragement to Miss Morgan as the stout girl
made clumsy efforts to follow suit. At the rope
works they were joined
by four or five con-
genial spirits of their
own age, sex and sta-
tion, and so, trium-
phantly, with legs a-
swing, squealing jubi-
lant impudence at all
sorts and conditions
of men, the Pagans
rode home.
The way to work in
the morning was en-
livened by frequent en-
counters with jocose
young milkmen, rau-
cous sand carters, and
whimsical butcher’s as-
sistants. Strange
though it may seem,
it is nevertheless true
that no driver of a
milk-cart could pass
Jinny and Maud with-
out shouting at them
some terse sentiment,
the humor of which lay
in its gratuitous inso-
lence. Thripny usually
responded for both
with a shrill yell—
“ A-a-a-h, ’ave it
stitched!” or, “Hi,
where yer goin’ wi’
ther bones?” The
uninitiated might have
thought the greeting
and the response bitter,
even vindictive. They were nothing of the kind.
Often they were the preliminaries to an amorous
friendship, and led to votive plates of hot peas
and sociable rides in the swing-boats at the gay
market on Saturdays.
Coffee Morgan and Thripny worked close
together at the same board, and when not work-
ing they were linked together in an awkward
embrace. They were the closest cobbers the
factory had known, and yet Maud was never any-
thing but sullen and depressed, whereas the
factory often revolted against Jinny s joyful
melodies because of their “damnable iteration.”
It needed Maud’s warning growl: “Chuck it,
Thripny ! ” a dozen times a day to repress her
musical exuberance.
Then, one morning, Miss Bitt came in alone.
“ Gor bli ! ” said the packer, in amazement, “ bin
a funeral in the family, er what ? ”
“Speak t’cher equals!” said Thripny, with
none of her usual vivacity.
A RELIGIOUS IMPULSE.
THE CAPITALIST : “ And what did you say when
Mamma told you that I was going to be your
new Papa ?”
MAUDIE : “As soon as I had finished crying I
said my prayers.”
Coffee Morgan came later, looking more morose
than ever. “Split partners, hev yer, Corfee?”
said the packer. “ S’pose ther dark man’s come
between yer?”
“Give yer swipe cross ther jore ! ” mumbled
Miss Morgan.
At their board, the pair worked in silence, as
far apart as possible. Thripny had no inclina-
tion to sing; she was ill at ease. Maud’s face
was set sourly over her work, and she never raised
her eyes. The Beauties were inquiring but
derisive, and Jinny, who had hitherto done all
the barracking for herself and Maud, and had
always been effective in retort, was silent now.
So matters remained till the afternoon, when
Feathers intervened.
“It’s like this,” said the packer, addressing
the factory, “ Mord saw ’im first, ’n’ Thripny’s
bin ’n’ pinched him. No wonder Morgan’s givin’
A CONFIRMED LEANER.
MILLER (wrathfully regarding the new rouse-
about): “By thunder, I know now what
M'Intyre meant when he recommended that
fellow as suitable fer the post.”
’er brusher —lie’s ther pride iv ther habattoirs,
ain’t he, Mordie?” Coffee Morgan was slapping
paste all over her work, and her small, “ greenery-
yallery” eyes were turned up vindictively.
“Don’t have him on yer thinker, little sister,”
continued Mills, with much sympathy, “he ain’t
th’ on’y sardine in ther tin. Put on yer spring
rnillin’ry, ’n’ get out after er squatter, why don’t
yer ? ”
At this point Coffee Morgan’s feelings became
too many for her. She uttered a piggish scream
of fury, and darted at Thripny. Clutching her
bunch of short hair with one hand, Maud smote
her cobber of yesterday about the face and head
with her paste brush, and then, dropping the
brush, got at her with the Beauties’ favorite
weapons, and scratched like a burrowing terrier.
Borne back against the board, slightly off her
perpendicular, Thripny was quite helpless against
the fury of her small enemy. She seemed over-
come with a great amazement, and stared with
wide-eyed, stupid surprise, while Miss Morgan
scratched, and tore, and punched. Jinny Bitt’s
astonishment was so comical that, tragic as the
incident was, the unfeeling Beauties laughed
aloud.
The packer went to the rescue, and struggled
with Coffee Morgan, while Fuzzy, the lean fore-
man, in his excitement endeavored to walk
through two pasting boards, and fell three tunes
in ten yards, hastening to quell the riot. Jinny
and Maud were put to work at separate boards.
The former did not recover from her surprise for
twenty minutes, and then she started to cry, and
wept long and bitterly, and her tears ran down
the furrows Miss Morgan’s nails had made.
During the following three days Jinny con-
tinued silent, and Maud vindictive, There was
something of triumph in Jinny’s air, however,
that excited Maud beyond bearing. Five times
she rushed Jinny with the intention of inflicting
liberal bodily harm, but Maud was nowhere in a
race with Thripny. The factory was enjoying
itself, but the lean foreman was thrown into
pathetic distress of mind. Spats’ was short-
handed. If Fuzzy Ellis sacked a girl the authori-
ties below would bound on him, and break his
heart with duplicated abuse; and, on the other
hand, if knowledge of the disturbance above
came to the powers below, they would unite to
abase and abuse him. That was what he was there
for. Several stout pasters were posted between
the foes to intercept and overcome Coffee Morgan
when wrought too far by silent contemplation of
her wrongs.
On Monday morning there was a new develop-
ment. Maud came upstairs smiling, actually
smiling. The Beauties squealed, Feathers cried
“Wow !” and the town traveller collapsed on a
stack of bags. Maud had not been known to
smile even in the old happy days. Jinny Bitt
came up a few minutes later. Her eyes were
red and swollen, and she was the picture of
misery. The Beauties greeted her with a shout
that broke her up, and, mopping her tears with
the front of her jacket, she bellowed dismally on
her way round to the changing-room. There was
a silence of seven minutes, and then a yell
announced the outbreak of hostilities. The packer
rushed, but was just too late. Thripny had struck
Maud on the head with the hot, iron paste-ladle,
and Maud was thinking it over on the floor.
Now, the difficulty was to keep Jinny Bitt off
Coffee Morgan, and Jinny, as the turned worm,
was much more ferocious than Maud had been.
She had a tongue, too, and before noon the factory
had Maud’s history, and the history of Maud’s
mother, who, it appeared, once cleaned skins at a
sausage mill, and of Maud’s father, who had to be
treated in gaol for a morbid habit of gathering
bags of hens from other people’s roosts at un-
seemly hours.
“’N’ she cracks she’s someone, ’n’ wears asylum
’and-me-downs !” squealed Jinny. “What price
pauper ’ats frim ther Ladies’ Beneverlent? Any-
one kin put on dog when they cadges their rags
frim a bloomin’ institoot.”
Coffee Morgan plied her nimble fingers,
mumbling sourly all the time, only an occasional
word or two like “scrougers,” “ sooer rats,” and
“ low commonies” being articulate.
“I’ll fight yer,”yelled Thripny defiantly. “I’ll
.take it outer yer, any day. Come ’n’ ’it me now,
’n’ y’ll cop yer doss in ther Morgue.”
Maud mumbled on, but kept out of range.
Thripny’s demonstrations had cowed her.
“ So yer loored him bagk with yer pretty
ways?” said the packer to Coffee Morgan at
lunch-time.
“ How yer talk ! ” growled Maud.
“ Ther Pride’s true t’ yer after all. ‘ Come
back,’ sez you, ‘ ’n’ all will be fergot ’n’forgave,
’n’ no questions arst’; ’n’ now he’s yours for
keeps.” •' . ,
“Ther lad what’s keepin’ co. with me amt
got no use fer scrags, if that’s what yer song’s
erbout,” said Miss Morgan, almost pertly.
Maud paid dearly for her triumph. Jinny
harried her in the factory with hard blows and
bitter speech, and she hunted her all the way
home in pursuit of her vengeance. The sight of
Thripny tearing down Egg Lane after her enemy
was a new joy for the lads at the butter mart and
the potato dep6t, and the “ hoys ” that resulted
startled the town.
But another change came within a week. Jinny
bobbed up on Friday, radiant.
“’Twiz all er mistook,” she said joyfully to
Feathers. “He’s true t’ me. Coffee’s gone t’
ther tip.” .
“Bli’ me,” said the packer, “Ned’s er bit
shifty, ain’t he?”
“Oh, we’re pets now, me ’n’ him. He s arst
me t’ Snadger Halligan’s darnce nex’ month.”
For four days Maud was terribly depressed,
and Jinny crowed over her without pity. Once
Miss Morgan threw a ladle of hot paste oyer
Thripny, and once the pair fought a destructive
two-minute round in the lift corner, but there
were many changes before Snadger Halligan’s
dance came off. Coffee Morgan came into her
own again, and was deposed again. The fluctua-
tions of feeling wrought by the mysterious un-
known awakened a hilarious interest amongst the
Beauties, and the first question every day was
“Who's got him this mornin’, Thripny?”
Through it all Maud and Jinny remained bit-
terest enemies.
Thripny was in possession of the vagrant fancy
of the much beloved, and Snadger Halligan’s
dance was only two nigbts off. Which would
have him for the “ darnce ” ? The Beauties were
much concerned, and betting was rife. Feathers
was making a book on the event. It was at lunch
time. Feathers was sitting on his own bench,
finishing his bundle, when an unknown came up
the stairs. He was an under-sized, bullet-headed
youth of about 24, “ez plain ez er bottle iv
pickled mussels,” said the packer to his friend,
the town traveller, “ ’n’ lookin’ like ther cockle

class ernough t be er roustabout et er traimn
stable fer dogs, ’n’ he ’ad ther sting-proof cheek
iv er Scotch auctioneer.”
The stranger stopped at the top of the stairs,
put his hands to his mouth, and uttered the fami-
liar call of the early morning milkman. That
identified him. Then he turned to the packer,
and said: , . ,
“ Got er tom name iv Bitt workin ere erbart,
ai said the packer with his mouth
full. . ~,,,,
“Oh, she’s one er mine, tha s all.
“ What-o, Billy-be-dam’d, V yow it ? ” said the
packer. ~,111x1
“ Come orf, I’m no it, answered the lad. 1 m
sometliink.”
“Yer dreamin’,” scoffed Feathers.
Thripny had heard the call. She approached
diffidently. “Elio, Danny,” she said. “Who’d
’a’ tliort?”
“’Ere’s ther bit o’ stick,’ said Danny to
Feathers, and then he took Jinny aside, and for
a few moments they talked in low voices, but
with increasing feeling, and from over bales and
round stacks the Beauties tittered and giggled at
the prize boy who had kept Thripny Bitt and
Coffee Morgan at deadly enmity for a month past.
Maud stood at a little distance and glowered. It
was presently seen that Danny and Miss Bitt
were not agreeing too well.
“ It’s orf,” said Danny ; “I thort I’d tell yer
it’s O double F orf. This is the chuck fer yow,
Sticks. I’m otherwise engaged fer ther future.
Yer got smoogin’ up ter Gopher Eddie at ther
Blondin, Chewsdee, ’n’ that’s ther last quarter.
It’s me talcin’ Little Bilk-street ter the darnce at
Snadger’s—Bilk-street! Put it in yer book. No
more fact’ry rats for Danno.” This was hurled at
Maud, who was edging up. Dan threw out his
hand, edge on, and wreathed lip and nose con-
temptuously. “No more rats, d’y”ear ? Both
o’ yer, when yer meets me next, ’ll get brusher. ’
Dan had turned at the top of the stairs to
deliver the last salute, and a tornado of discarded
lunch struck him, and blotted him out. The
Beauties considered “fact’ry rats” an offensive
phrase.
“ Bilk-street! ” gasped Thripny.
“ It’s Liz Bricky,” mumbled Miss Morgan.
Thripny flew to the balusters, and yelled abuse
after Danny. Danny responded in kind as he
passed down in a shower of scraps. Mills gave
him “ the order ” most offensively.
“ Gar-r-rt, cat’s milk,” cried Miss Bitt.
“Wouldn’t be seen with your sort at er bottle-
oh’s garding party.”
“ Scrouger ! Scrouger ! ” mumbled Coffee Mor-
gan, spitting after the retreating lad. “ Who bit
ther pig?”
“Ever speak t’ me agin ’n’y’ll cop out, said
Jinny. “I’ll put ther John on ter yer, that’s
what.”
“Cat’s milk! Cat’s milk!” said Maud, sul-
lenly. She was not audible five yards off, but
wished to keep her end up. Jinny had the last
words, a triumphant yell covering Dan with odium
as a stealer of doormats.
“Now yiv done verselves in, both iv yeh,” said
the packer. “ Hensforth, Danno’s on’y er
cherished mem’ry. Bilk-street’s got him
clinched.”
“ Our trulis ! ” answered Thripny, with terrible
scorn. She wound a long, thin arm affectionately
around Maud. Maud responded in kind. “Don'
want nothink t’ do with low larrikins like Danno,
we don’t,” she mumbled, and the two went dowi
the room, linked lovingly. The entente cordiah
was restored.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I’VE a little sparkling friend,
Gay, inconsequent, and idle,
Telling tales that have no end,
Full of laughter- none can bridle.
See him as he leaps and chatters
Down his runway green and comely,
Teasing all his sheen to tatters,
Mocking when the wild duck squatters
From her hidden nest and homely.
See him as he slows and lingers
In still pools and leafy places
Where the willows trail their fingers.
There the dipper bows and paces,
There the cows can see their faces
(Kindly, gentle, stupid faces),
As they step ’twixt stone and stone,
Drink, and breathe, and wander on.
See him drowsy, tired of fun,
Lying blinking in the sun.
There the sturdy water-rat
I lirts his tail among the grasses,
Whets his teeth on this and that,
Where his sleek brown body passes
Makes a thousand bubbles break
Dimpling in his silver wake.
See him when his waters curl in
Baby waves and tiny tideways,
Leaf-and-froth-filled from the rain.
When his flotsam, sweeping sideways,
Perches on some inch-deep eyot,
How his wrath and bubbling riot
Shakes it, shifts it, sends it swirling
Out into mid-stream again !
Little Friend, ’tis good to hear you
Tinkle down your shining shallows,
Gurgle into turfy hollows,
Slide thro’ sunny pools, where swallows
Flash their snowy breasts a-near you !
When the willows droop above you
On thro’ flickered shade you move you,
Crooning love-words all along.
Then to hear you is to love you,
Winsome water, silver tongue !
Whisper me, my pretty lover,
Do you hate the cold as I do ?
When the white mist comes to cover
All your glancing, do you try to
Laugh and talk ? Or do you run
Silent, aching for the sun ?
Little gladheart Friend and River,
Is the dark a terror to you ?
When the black night blinds you, robbing
All your joy, ah, tell me, do you
Lift a frightened whimper ever?
As I hearken, when ways darken,
For your small, untroubled flow,
Tell me, do I hear you sobbing,
Sobbing as you go ?

Bill Cooper’s Leech.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
rnHE old man rubbed his shin and shook
| his head at the mountain.
There’s goin’t’ be a change !” he said,
very ruefully. “ I knoo it was cornin’ ! ”
The school-teacher knew that a reply was ex-
pected, so he removed his pipe and murmured
sympathetically, “Rheumatism, eh?”
“ Roomatics ! ” corrected the old man. “ Roo-
matics ! ”
The teacher resumed smoking.
Both men sat idly staring at the hills and listen-
ing to the evening breeze whispering to the gums
Then the old man started :
9 “ When yer farmin’, th’ weather is everythin’
t’ yer, an’ in a farmin’ community, the man that’s
wiUm’t’ talk about th’ weather is always sure of
a hearm’. I’ve listened t’men talkin’about the
weather who hadn’t got no more sense than a
rabbit ’bout ordinary things, but they knoo th’
local signs better’n any ’stronomer that ever was.
Th’ man that’s got a touch of roomatics in him, or
a good reliable corn, is of more value to a farmin’
districk, an’ there’s more confidence put in ’im,
than all th’ barom’ters yer could stuff in a bullick
dray.
I remember in me father’s time it was
there was an old man be th’ name of Dan Cooper
lived over on Parker’s Plain who had th’most
reeliable roomatics I ever heerd of. He could
give you warnin’ of a change three days ahead,
an’ whenever a man was passin’ that way an’ felt
doubtful about th’weather, he uster drop in ’an
ask old Dan how he felt.
“Dan ’d sit there an’ think f’r a minit dog-
nosin’ his symptoms f’r th’ last day or so ; then
p’raps he’d say, ‘I had a twinge in me left arm
th’ day afore yesterdee.’
“ ‘ Well, what d’ye make o’ that?’
“‘We’ll have a spell o’rain if th’ wind don’t
change.’
“ ‘D’ye reckon it will ?’ th’ man’d say.
“ Then old Dan ’d feel his leg an’ say: ‘ I
ain’t too sure about this ’ere leg. I’m expectin’ it
t’ start any minit now, an’, if it do, we’ll get th’
wind strong from th’ sou’-west.’
“Then th’ chap ’d say: ‘When d’ye reckon
it’ll come ?’
Toosday,’ old Dan’d say, an’ ten t’ one on
Toosday th’ wind would blow like blazes from th’
sou’-west, or else th’ rain’d come.
“Well, o’ course, old Dan was well thought of
all roun’ our districk ; but so many people came
askin’ his advice, he got conceited, an’ thought no
onebuthisself knoo wind from dust. That wouldn’t
’a’ been so bad, but whenever he made a mistake,
an’ predicted wrong—which sometimes happened
—he’d get angry, an’ throw th’ blame on Provi-
dence, saym’it had sent along th’ signs f’r one
sort o’ weather, an’ then changed its mind an’
sent somethin’ else that upset his calculations
an’ made a fool of ’im.
“ This sorter thing uster make Bill Cooper mad.
Bill was old Dan’s son, an’ a scientific weather
prophet. He tol’ me one night, ‘Look 'ere,’ he'
says, ‘ I puts my faith in leeches. What an ole
man leech don’t know about weather ain’t worth
knowin’. I’ve read about ’em, an’ I’ve studied ’em,
an’ I’ve kept th’ damn things, an’ all I can say is,
if the old man knows any more about weather
than my leech does, he oughter be up at the
Observat’ry gettin’ a millyun a minit!’ That’s
NATURAL ALARM.
BARBER'S WIFE (receiving payment for shave): “Ta!”
SHEARER : “ Tar! ’ Streuth, did lie cut me that bad?"
th lib ral way Bill uster talk when he wasn’t
usin’ his own money.
I asked Bill how th’ thing knoo, an’ who
found out first, but Bill only said he’d read it all
in a book, an’ he’d got a leech an’ was goin’t’
make a fool of th’ old man.
Cordin t what he told me, he kept his leech
in a glass jar full o’ water, with a piece o’ linen
tied over the top. If th’ weather was goin’t’ be
fine, th’ leech’d lay quiet at th’ bottom of th’
jar, rolled up in a tight ball. For frost he’d do
th same thing. If rain or snow was cornin’ along,
he d rise to th’ surface an’ stop there. Before
wind he’d be always on th’ move, swimmin’ up
an’ down, an’ he’d do th’ same thing f’r at least
twenty-four hours before thunder —only he’d move
in sharp jerks an’ show he was anxious.
“I said: ‘Bill, th’ only drawback about th’
leech system that I can see is that he seems t’
show th’ same symptoms f’r two diff’rent things.
Ain’t that liable t’ throw yer out ? ’
‘“Oh, well,’ says he, ‘if y’ expect th’ blanky
thing t’ get up on its hind-legs an’ talk t’ yer’—-
Well, says I, ‘passin’ th’ subject o’ hindlegs
which, by the way, it ain’t got —how are y’
goin’t’ tell whether he means thunder or wind ?
He makes th’ same sign f’r both, don’t he ? ’
“Bill said, ‘By feelin’ ’is blanky pulse ! ’ an’
walked off.
“A day or so afterwards, old Dan got wind o ;l
Bill’s scheme, an’ come hobblin’ down on his two
sticks to th’ paddick where Bill was ploughin’.
What’s this damn nonsense I hear about
leeches? ’ says the old man, tremblin’ with rage.
“ Bill dropped his ploughin’, an’ started t’ ex-
plain his system, but th’ old chap wouldn’t listen
to him.
‘.“You young whelp!’ he says. ‘Ain’t you
satisfied with what I says ? D’ye think a damn
creepin’ insect knows more about weather than
y’r own father ? What have I been doin’ all me
life?’
“ ‘Nothin’!’ yells Bill.
‘“Yer a liar!’ says old Dan. ‘l’ve been
studyin’ tli’ weather, an’ I’ll back meself agin any
leech or other reptile t’ predick weather. Are y’
willin’ t’ bet ?’
“ ‘ Yes, ’ says Bill. ‘ I’ll bet yer ! ’
“ ‘What’ll y’ bet?’ says the old man, pretty
sharp.
“ ‘ Level two quid, ’ says Bill.
“‘Oh ! ’ says old Dan. ‘ I forgot you ain’t got
any money. But I tell yer what I will do. I’ll
bet y’ th’ twenty-acre paddick t’ three years’ free
labor that I beat y’r rotten leech in a fair an’ square
go ! Are y’ game ? ’
“ ‘Done! ’ says Bill, an’ th’ two of ’em shook
hands on it. They was a great sportin’ family
was th’ Coopers.
“ Th’ news soon got round th’ town, an’, ’fore
anyone knoo what was happenin’, a committee of
five was appointed t’ supervise th’ test, an’ they
waited on th’ minister an’ asked him, as a special
favor, to referee. After a good deal of yabberin’
an’ rushin’ back’ards an’ for’a’ds, it was agreed
that th’ weather f’r th’ followin’ week was to be
predicted on Monday night be th’ two competitors
in th’ presence of the ’ficials an’ specktaters.
“Th’ meetin’—which was held in th’ school
hall—was the most crowded function we’d had in
th’ town f’r years. When, at' 8 o’clock, the old
man came hobblin’ in on his sticks, with Bill
bringin’ up th’ rear with a big glass bottle in his
arms, the house rose an’ cheered f’r five minits.
“They climbed up on the stage, with all th’
people yellin’ an’ whistlin’ like mad. Then old
Dan Cooper sat down on one side of th’
referee, an’ Bill planked down his bottle on
the table an’ sat down on th’ other side.
“ When lie could make himself heard, th’
minister got up an’ made a speech about what he
called ‘this interestin’ experiment,’ and called
on Mr. Cooper, seen-yer, t’ prophesy f’r the
cornin’ week. Then he sat down, an’ old Dan
rubbed ’is shins, an’ felt ’is shoulder, an’ sniffed
the air twict, after which he wrote somethin’
down on a piece of paper, an’ stood up.
“‘Ladies an’ gen’lemen,’ says he, ‘I have
pleasure in predictin’ f’r th’ next seven days as
follows Monday, dry; Tuesday, dry; Wednes-
day, dry; Thursday, dry; Friday, Satur-
day , an’ Sunday all dry as a bone, with
mod late wind an dust. There ain’t no change
comin as I can feel, an’ T ’ll back my old
bones agin any leech that ever was bottled ! ’
Then ’e sat down, an’ all the old school
pounded like mad with their sticks an’ umbrellies
an’ said ‘ Bravo ! ’
“After that young Bill got up and had a good
look at his leech, which was floatin’ quiet on top
of tli’ water.
Ladies an gen’lemen,’ says Bill, ‘reposin’
as I do implicit faith in the instink of the lower
animals, an’ bearin’ in mind that this ’ere little
leech o’ mine is now floatin’ still an’ quiet on the

surface of the water, I have pleasure in predictin’
a heavy downpour o’ rain, which will last all the
week. Th’ leech has been layin’ still on top of
th’water f’r two days, an’as it ain’t possible f’r
th' thing’s instink t’ be mistaken, I’d ad me
everyone here to-night t’ hurry home an’ see that
th’ roofs an’ drains is in good order, because
this storm is goin’t’ be a bosh ter !
“There was tremenjous cheerin’ when Bill
„t„ , r ,
spoke so emphatic for rain, because th crowd seen
it was goin t be a fair go, an’ there wasn’t any
clianst of both of’em claimin’t’be right.
“They had just started t’ move out fr home
when th’ minister got up an’ asked ’em to give
’im their attention while ’e made an announce-
ment. Then, wen everythin’ was quiet, ’e said
that Mister Willyum Cooper ’ad generously con-
sented to allow is leech t’ be on view in th’
chemist’s winder durin’ th’ week, an’ ’e was sure
that everyone would take th’ opportunity of
inspectin th sagacious little animal, on which so
much depended. Th’ crowd clapped ’im as if ’e
’ad said somethin’ useful, an’ went ’ome.
“Well, we’ve had many dry spells in this
districk in th’ last forty years, but th’ prophesyin’
week was th’ driest we ever seen ! Monday was
dry, Toosday was dry, Wednesday was dry—
Thursday, Friday, Saturday an’ Sunday, they was
all dry as sermons, an’ a damn sight hotter ! Old
Dad Cooper near went off ’is nut with conceit, an’
Bill got wilder an’ wilder until about Thursday.
Whenever anyone spoke t’ ’im, he’d tell ’em t’ go
t’ ’ell first, an’ ask ’em what they wanted after-
wards.
“ All day long there was a little group roun’ th’
chemist’s, starin’ at th’ leech, but th’ leech seemed
t’ be unanimous about wet weather, f’r ’e floated
quiet on top of th’ water, an’ kept on floatin’, as
if ’e expected floods any minit.
“One chap asked Bill if it wasn’t possible f’r
th’ leech t’ be meanin’ bush fires, or somethin’
an’ Bill punched his nose, an’ told ’im th’ usual
thing. O’ course, it meant three years ’ard labor
f’r Bill!
“Well, on Monday night there was another
tremenjous muster in th’ school hall, with th’ par-
son in th’ chair, an’ a perfesser up f’r his health on
his right hand, an’ a travellin’ doctor on his left.
Old Dan an’ Bill was in th’ foreground, while th’
leech—still floatin’—occupied a prominent posi-
tion in th’ centre of th’ stage.
“ T h’ parson got up, an’, after praisin’ old Dan
as a judge of weather, said that this was a sing’-
lar illustration of the uncertainty of life, an’ th’
necessity f’r keepin’ a guard upon our tongues.
‘ Here,’ he said, ‘ was a fine, vigoris -young man
in th’ prime of life condemned to labor for three
years for nothing on his father’s farm, through his
own rashness in questionin’ th’ value of his
aged parint’s opinion ! What an example to all
of us!
“ Bill opened ’is mouth, stood up, an ? sat down
again.
“Th’ minister went on t’ say that we was not t’
place too much reliance on animals, ’specially
horses an’ leeches, an’ that he had much pleasure
in declarin’ his ole friend, Mister Daniel Cooper,
th’ winner of this scientific contest. Then ’e sat
down, an’ the old brigade stood up, an’ cheered,
an’ waved their brollies f’r five minits, while Bill
stood in th’ centre of the stage, shakin’ both fists
at ’em, an’ tryin’t’ curse louder than th’ cheerin’.
“ After a bit th’ crowd got tired, an’ sat down,
an’ Bill was left there, red and breathless, along-
side ’is leech. He waited f’r a minit till he got
his breath, then he says : ‘I demand,’ he says, ‘a
searchin’ investigation. Either th’ leech has been
tampered with, or ’e ain’t well. Before th’ pro-
ceedin’s proceed any further, I would like th’ two
scientific gentleman now on the platform—if they
will be so kind—to examine th’ leech now floatin’
in that there bottle, an’ say if he is in a normal
condition—f’r a leech ! ’
“ Then, when the crowd started t’ get restless
and boo-hoo,’ he added : ‘Eadies an’ gen’lemen,
I beg t’ remind all of yous that I ’ave a lot at
stake an’ that this is a perfeckly fair an’ legal
proceedin’! ’
“ There was a great fuss then, an’ the minister
had hard work persuadin’ old Dan t’ sit quiet
while th’ doctor an’ the perfesser was bein’ asked
to examine th’ leech.
“ Well, o’ course, they consented, an’ th’ whole
place held its breath while th’ two men took th’
linen cover off th’ jar an’ looked thro’ their
spectacles at th’ leech lyin’ so calm an’ confident
on, top of th’ water. They whispered together
an took turns smellin’ the water, an’ while one
was lookin’ at it from the front the other was
lookin’ at it from th’ back, or bendin’ down tryin’
to look underneath it. Finally, th’ perfesser
came down t’ th’ footlights an’ held up his hand
f’r silence. When he got it, he says, very solim :
“ ‘ Has any lady here got a hat-pin ? ’
“ Now, fancy an eddicated man askin’ civilised
women a question like that!
“ Next second he was bein’ offered five thousand
hat-pins, rangin’ from five inches to a yard-an’-
a-half. He took one about half-a-yard long, an’
then he an’ the doctor lifted out th’ leech an’ laid
it on a bit of white paper, dognosin’ it f’r about
ten minits. People in th’ back o’ the hall was
standin’ on th’benches, an’ them in front was sittin’
bolt upright, almost crackin’ their necks tryin’t’
see over the edge of th’ platform. There wasn’t a
sound, but th’ shufflin’ o’ feet, an’ old Dan snort-
in’ honist indignation through his nose like a fire
engine. Bill was skatin’ on the outskirts o’ th’
company, an’ tryin’t’ look as calm as the leech.
“ At last the two doctors, after whisperin’ an
whisperin’ an’ peerin’, straightens themselves,
an’ looks each other fair in the eye acrost th’
table.’
‘“Are we decided ?’ says the perfesser, very low.
“ ‘ We are,’ says th’ doctor, very solim.
" ‘ Then,’ says th’ perfesser, ‘I take it that I

A Mad, Mad Song.
nn HE wind and I,
Racing riotously
The myriad raindrops’ swift,
sweet, wet, white hurrying feet,
As a sudden shimmering, sibilant shower falls in
a silver sheet
Across the wide brown road fringing the bay.
Towering overhead,
Brown and purple and red,
Piled in masses resplendent across the azure way,
Storm clouds thunder-rent,
The sunset’s arrow spent,
Floods in a glory gory the Death of Day.
I and the mad wind,
The wind and the mad I,
Racing riotously.
The wind and I
Racing riotously.
Mad ! mad ! mad ! with the hint of the coming
storm !
Racing the horses white,
That gallop in mad delight
Over the wide brown strip of the shingled beach ;
Drenched with the salt sea spray
Drifting in showers away
From the boom ! boom ! boom ! of the breakers
flinging it out of reach !
Sheeted the lightnings flash and fork ; crash the
echoing thunders roar
Racing along the shore,
The mad soul of the mad wind,
And the soul of the mad, mad I
Flying tumultuously.
The wind and I
Racing riotously
Over the wet sand by the sobbing sea ;
Feeling on hair and face
The clinging, sweet caress
Of the white, white mist of the night creeping in
o’er the lea,
Watching the light fade over the dim hills,
Watching the day die. Somewhere a bird trills !
Softly the young night steps with her slim, light,
delicate heel twirled
Across the swooning depths of the dim hushed
world.
I and the mad, mad wind,
The wind and the mad, mad I
Going seriously.
The wind and I
Racing riotously
Home through the silver shadows, the shuddering
rain, the night;
Over the wet sand by the sodden turf
Where the sobbing moan of the beaten, broken
surf
Wails to the wind. The mad wind and I
Pause for a moment to catch the crooning cry,
Like the fret of a little babe complaining itself
to sleep,
Rocked in the great mother arms of thundering
deep upon deep.
Then away ! away ! away ! on the wind’s wild
wings,
And a song piercing the gloom that the soul of
me sings,
The mad, mad soul of the wind
And the soul of the mad, mad I
Flying tumultuously.

f HEY know how this man lost his berth,
Why that man’s plans miscarried.
They hint that Jack is not much worth,
And Jill had best get married.
Why Mrs. A. is waxing fat,
While A. is getting leaner.
They criticise the maiden’s hat.
And weigh her beau’s demeanor.
They whisper over cups of tea
Their scandal and their railing.
Their narrow eyes are keen to see
A fellow-creature’s failing.
They worry over trivial things—
Their servants and their dinners.
That simp’ring little laugh—it rings
So false, to us poor sinners.
The Band of Hope. The Sunday-school.
The choir. The Chinese mission.
The dismal life that’s lived by rule.
The terror of perdition.
The woeful want of charity
That outward meekness jostles,
Would gratify the Pharisee-
Disgust the Twelve Apostles.
The ancient platitudes they preach
Annoy me past endurance.
The essence of the creed they teach
Is merely Fire Insurance.
They say that we shall meet again
Beyond this life’s estrangements.
If that is so, this bard is fain
To make some fresh arrangements.

The Day of Cold Lamb.
PARSONS preach of a lurid day that will
dawn with the crack of doom,
When we’ll all go hence in a thundering
cloud of sorrow and wrack and gloom ;
But we wake each week to a foretaste grim of
that prophecy grey and drear—
A taste of the ultimate, awful hour when we’ll all
give up our beer.
We turn out, slow, in our blacks and blues, and
we go to church all day,
And we live on cold tack, noon and eve, while the
slushy goes out to pray ;
They say we’re sinners, every one, that tramp
this earth—l am
When Sunday dawns on Melbourne, dull, with its
dinner of cold roast lamb.
That day, they bury the stored marine to the
murmur of rumbling drums,
And the people haunt the churchyards damp,
with decayed chrysanthemums.
While the shiny, slow shopwalker takes four
children in a row
To see, among the tombstones, how the graveyard
grasses grow.
That day, the cheerless offspring of the pious
churchman crawls
To spend the golden afternoon in dim, religious
halls;
That night, the late bird walks—because there is
no midnight tram,
And, noon and eve, the godly eat stale bread and
plain cold lamb.
The broad, white streets are bare, and eight winds
howl there all day long;
No sound disturbs the dreadful calm of the town
where you can’t go Wrong ;
The lazy trains creep in and out, like tame snails
on the fence,
And the ignorant clown in the reachmedowns,
with an ear and an awe immense,
Harks to the barks of the angry bunch who rattle
the bones of sin
At the pleasantly pitiful “afternoon” where
thruppence ’ll let you in.
O’ Sundays we cover ourselves in black, we wallow
in sighs and sham,
And the slavey goes out all day while we worry
along on cold roast lamb.

Bill Writes from a Prohibition
Town.
BEHOLD a place with roofs of red,
Where joy is void, and hope is dead ;
’Tis situated on a plain
With great extremes of heat and rain,
As I can very aptly tell—
For by decree of Fate I dwell
Beside a long-deserted pub,
In this lone township in the scrub.
The pub was closed two years to-night,
That men might tread the paths of Light,
And I can only scowl and cuss
The folk that brought this wrong on us.
Where once the bushman drank his gin
And smoked the pipe of peace within,
The dust lies thick upon the floors —
The thistles rustle by the doors.
No more the casual swagman comes
Along the track beneath the gums ;
No more the sun-tanned drover rides
Beyond the lazy river-tides,
And turns his horse this way; the beat
Of hoofs is strange unto our street.
Instead, he passes thro’ the haze,
Dreaming of girls and other days.
The whirring flash of cattle whips,
And laughing eyes, and pouting lips—
They come again in memory clear,
And bring me dreams of love and beer;
And in my visions on my bed
I see cool drinks beside my head.
I reach for them with trembling hand,
And then awake—to understand.
They’ve built a church, and those old mates
Who drank with me in divers States,
Have turned church-goers, and alone
I stand and listen to the tone
Of that great bell the parson rings
On his dull day of solemn things ;
A fitting sound, in silence deep,
Rocking a drowsy world to sleep.
And, worst of all, of later weeks,
The blazing sun has dried the creeks ;
There’s little water in the tanks,
And less along the river banks.
And I begin to fear the worst—
I think that we shall die of thirst!
Victims of those that closed the pub,
In this lone township in the scrub.

p r B'lHE world’s a wobbly world to-night, two

Lo ! see them once again unite, when I

The glittering spheres rotate above, the pavement

And who is this that calls me “love,” and shows
her gold-filled teeth ?
The usual cab behind doth steal, with furtive
lagging pace—
Ho ! let -us mount a hansom wheel, and spin
through stellar space.
Ahorse! My kingdom for a horse! —a “robbo”

I’ll steer me on my carmine course, with oysters
at the helm.
To-night with Patchoulina fair, enthroned in

I ride with lobsters in my hair, to either make or

Let pale ascetics feebly flout, and cynics sneer
their sneers;
The mighty squirt of Bottled Stout still rushes
down the years.
Ho ! how the blazing comets spin and whirl
within my head !

And mention to the universe the sun won’t rise

HORACE HALLORAN.
Vagabond of Beaches.
I’VE the mermaid for my neighbor,
She can dance to flute or tabor,
I’m a vagrant freed from labor,
Work was never meant for me;
Here I know the beating tide’ll
Hasten to a joyous bridal,
And I’m quite content to idle,
Doing nothing by the sea.
All the city work and clamor
And the clang of wheel and hammer
Never did my soul enamor,
Now I laze by shadowed lee,
Where the sleepy wave is creaming
Yellow sand, and free from scheming,
Emulate the lizard, dreaming,
Doing nothing by the sea.
Watch the dawning sky-line brighten,
And the blue dome spread and heighten,
And the flaunting wave-curl whiten,
Like a living thing with glee,
Till the sun-god paints the skylight
In the west with low and high light;
Then I idle in the twilight,
Doing nothing by the sea.
I’ve been slave to social duties,
Where the voice of Nature mute is,
And the road to world repute is
Not a road of high degree ;
I have wooed a pretty madam,
Tailored, gloved, and shod by Fadliam,
Now I dress to rival Adam,
Doing nothing by the sea.
I’d a taste for wine and honey,
Pleasant dreams of fame and money,
But discovered nothing funny
In the daily grind for fee,
Though I learnt that melancholy
Dogs the laughing feet of Folly ;
Now, I’m growing wise and jolly,
Doing nothing by the sea.
Filled with craven dread of Topliet,
I have worn the garb of prophet
In the market —now I doff it,
For I’ve found the golden key
To the dreamy realms of pleasure,
Lush with lotus fruit and treasure,
And I gather ample measure
Doing nothing by the sea.
Once I deemed the world my debtor,
But my knowledge now is better
Since I’ve broken gyve and fetter
And my spirit gallops free. . . .
Lucky-bags that one may dip in
Yield an orange or a pippin ;
So I’ve let the racket rip in
Doing nothing by the sea.
I’ve the mermaid for my neighbor;
She can sing and beat the tabor,
But no eye may see me labor—
I and labor disagree;
I’m the vagabond of beaches,
Dreaming while the sea-wave teaches,
And I learn what mermaid speech is
Doing nothing by the sea.

The Curate and the Maid.
WHENE’ER a tale of love is told,
Whatever else there be in it,
It must, to please the young or old,
Have both a he and she in it.
And so the tale I tell to you,
A tale of calm felicity,
Tells of a man and maiden who
Once met in sweet simplicity.
He was a curate, young but grave,
The pink of prim propriety.
She was a sweet young thing, who gave
Her days to deeds of piety.
So when we built that church of ours
The curate consecrated it;
At Christmas time, with ferns and flowers,
The maiden decorated it.
The curate’s coat of sable black
Had neither flaw nor fleck on it,
Her dress was white, and front or back,
Without a spot or speck on it.
The curate’s face was pale and white.
As white as arum lilies are.
Her cheeks were pink, her eyes were bright,
Her lips as red as chillies are.
It was the eve of Christmas Day ;
The maid was bunching roses up.
The curate came and said, “ Pray, may
I help you hang those posies up ?
That ladder should be held, you know—
May I make bold to proffer to ? ”
The maiden smiled, and murmured, “ Oh!
How kind of you to offer to! ”
She wove long garlands on the ground,
So deftly and so readily.
Then, while she hung the garlands round,
He held the ladder steadily.
And when, at length, their work complete,
They sat in pensive attitude,
The curate said, “’Twas very sweet,”
While she expressed her gratitude.
They closed the church, and down the road
They walked with looks of piety ;
Then parted at the maid’s abode—
Two models of propriety.
But, on the curate’s coat, just where
A maiden’s cheek could rest on it,
There was a patch, as though just there
A flour bag had been pressed on it.
His cheek was white, picked out with red,
With two bright, rosy tips on it.
And some folks recognised, they said,
The print of two red lips on it.
Curates, a warning take from this :
You cannot all be sainted ones ;
But, if you choose red lips to kiss,
Avoid, at least, the painted ones.

In a Restaurant,
HERE, in this shrine of plenty, do I starve,
And watch the crowds who feast upon
the fat;
I poultry serve, and juicy joints I carve,
But little satisfaction dwells in that.
For while they eat, I only wait—in vain ;
For seldom much of substance comes my way;
When they are done but little doth remain,
And most of that is served again next day.
For while they eat I wait! Well, hardly that—
I rush obedient to a hundred calls,
This way and that; and one objects to fat.
And one for lack of it in anger bawls.
Another wildly gestures at his soup
To show the hair by which its title’s proved.
I bear it off ; but shortly back I troop
That self-same soup—but with the hair removed.
One man will make a study of the bill
And keep me waiting, whilst in language strong
A dozen call. Waiting’s not standing still —
That is, the waiting in a restauremy.
Slave to the wrath of vagabond or toff,
Whose bitter words are sharper than a prong,
I meekly meet their rage when things are “off”—
And much is off within a restaurow/.
They know not how I wish that I might say
The dish was “ on,” that I could entertain
Some vision for myself, but ev’ry day
By each new diner are my prospects slain.
From morn to night I wait on diners, who
Grumble and wash the good things down with
beer,
At lunch and dinner—and at supper, too,
When wine, and drunks, and sportive girls
appear.
I am the useful lean amongst the fat,
But I enjoy the goods I get by stealth ;
One great philosophy I’ve learnt is that
A good digestion’s worth a world of wealth.
At last I bang the chairs from off the floor—
A hint to lingerers to take their wings—
Gently persuade the last drunk to the door,
And then am “ off,” like all the other things.

Queen McKelpie Jean.
A SCOTCHBORIGINALITY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THOUGH wrapped for years in mystery
The story may have been,
This is the faithful history
Of Queen McKelpie Jean !
McHaggis was her maiden name,
If no mistake I’ve made—
A native, she,
Of old Dundee,
The home of marmalade !
Her conduct, if defensible
From certain points of view,
Was clearly reprehensible
To folks like me and you.
I don’t remember what she did,
Perchance some paltry thing
You’d scarcely blame —
But out she came,
When George the Third was King !
As she’d behaved misguidedly,
Transporting served her right!
Yet she was not, decidedly,
Transported with delight !
She “joined the arrestocracjq”
As Barrington would say !
At seventeen
McKelpie Jean
Was bound for Bot’ny Bay 1
She was a bit particular.
Whatever fault was hers;
And conduct perpendicular
Displeased the officers !
She was a winsome, sonsie lass
As eyes could wish to see,
Precise and nice,
And free from vice ;
The damsel from Dundee !
All badness is comparative,
And doubtless that is why
The lady of this narrative
Of officers was shy !
At their suggestive compliments
She’d neither frown nor blush,
Nor would she grin—
It ended in
Her “ taking to the bush ” !
Two convicts ran away with her
(Male prisoners, I mean);
They travelled night and day with her,
And served McKelpie Jean
As if she were an Empress, and
They were her humble slaves !
For Bob and Ben
Were gentlemen,
As well as thieving knaves !
Some innate sense of chivalry
Toward the lady fair
Subdued the bitter rivalry
Between the faithful pair.
And tenderly they tended her
To farthest New South Wales,
For weeks and weeks
Across the creeks
And o’er the hills and dales !
She was the ruling
royalty
For thirty years, or
more;
And, just to prove her
loyalty,
Of children she’d a
score!
CHAINED TO HIS DUTY.
I tell yer I'll make it 'ot fur yer if yer don't
slop fotterin' us.”
Yah! Don't we know yer can’t let go of ’iM.”
King Umbelong, of Cumbelong,
Was tall, and strong of will.
His realms (we’re told by some) belong
To what is Broken Hill,
And to the region roundabout.
However that may be
King Umbelong
Was tall and strong
And reigned with dignity !
Though lavish hospitality
He showed to neighbors nigh,
His'notions of morality
Were not absurdly high !
He was in fact (like lots of kings)
Beloved of ladies, who
Will gather round
Where kings are found—
As ladies love to do !
The amors of King Umbelong
Why call by wicked names ?
The ebon belles of Cumbelong
Were deemed delightful dames ;
But rampant indignation was
In all the ladies seen
When there was brought
Before the court
The fair McKclpie Jean !
SHAKSPEARE UP-TO-DATE.
HAMLET : “Perchance ’twill walk again.”
HORATIO : “ Unless , my lord , it catches the last tram.”
Her smile of maiden simpleness,
Her lovely golden hair,
Her charming dainty dimpleness,
Proclaimed a lady fair !
The warriors bold had captured her
With her companions twain !
Poor Bob and Ben
These ruthless men
Most sinfully had slain !
The dusky dames with tearfulness
They vainly sought to hide,
Perceived the king (with cheerfulness)
Proclaim the maid his bride !
Although they all detested her,
Their views they feared to speak !
They swore by stealth,
But drank her health
In water from the creek.
She taught them all to play the pipes,
She taught them how to sing,
And eat burgoo,
And haggis, too,
And dance a Highland fling !
The Barrier blacks for craftiness ,
Ye ken, can beat them a’!
The cle’il a bit o’ daftiness
Ye'll find in them, ava !
Though black as jet, they are as Scotch
As oats in Aberdeen !
Which proves descent,
It's evident ,
From Queen McKelpie Jean !

Fair Floraline.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
AFTER a two days’ call at Colombo in
the capacity of ship’s passenger, the most
strongly-constituted person is apt to
surrender to nerve strain, caused chiefly by the
persistency of the “sellers of the East and the
multitude thereof”; and I was no exception to
the rule.
My eyeballs ached from the wealth of color, the
gold and the silver of the embroideries, the glitter
of precious stones, and the shimmer of unrolled
silks. My ears were aching, too, with the cease-
less chatter from the harbor boats, and the shrill
cries of the diving boys who clustered round the
big liner, now getting up steam for departure.
My cabin was piled high with gaudy fabrics and
filagree ornaments, upon which the trade-marks
of Birmingham were materialising as the glamor
of Asia faded, and I drew my chair as close as I
could to the hatchway, in the hope that a care-
lessly-disposed tarpaulin might screen me from
the eagle eyes of the Parsee dealers who were
turning the deck into a bazaar.
It served its purpose effectually, and left a loop-
hole through which I could still catch glimpses of
vermilion cliff and fringing cocoa palms, of blue
waters and darting catamarans, and, incidentally,
view the new passengers who were being passed
along the gangway.
But it had its drawbacks also. In the little
passage leading to my retreat, two soft-voiced
lovers chose to locate themselves for the purpose
of saying farewell, and they were well advanced
in the preliminaries before I could collect my
senses sufficiently to give a warning cough. He
was kissing her violently, and she was giggling
delightedly, and I really did not know what to
do; if I discovered myself their last farewell
would be shadowed by the embarrassment of the
situation, and in any case the scene must soon be
finished, for the chief steward was already hunt-
ing belated visitors towards the shore-going tug.
While I hesitated, I became aware that the leave-
taking was a most romantic affair—something
unique as regarded the language, at any rate.
“ Fair Floraline,” said the deep voice, “you
will be sure to return ? How can I live so many
weary months without you ? ”
“England is more better than Ceylon,” said
the girl’s voice. “I am sick of this country and
the black people. There will be much amuse-
ment fancy balls and card parties—on this
voyage,” she added irrelevantly.
“ Ah, if I were not bound for the year to
the chemist, He Silva, would I not come
with you to watch that no one takes you
from me, my lovely girl?” said the man
tenderly. “But your home is here. You
’ will return ?”
“ Oh, Idessay I will come back next year when
Mrs. Van Weylen comes to make sale of the
plantation—that is, I might,” was the non-com-
mittal answer. Then there was more scuffling
and giggling, until a move was made to join the
outgoing stream of visitors. I moved forward
also so that I might catch a glimpse of the lovers
who rejoiced in such high-sounding names—she
called him Algernon, with the accent on the
second syllable—and it was decidedly a shock,
especially in the case of the fair Floraline, to dis-
cover that they were both Cingalese of a most
uncompromising darkness of skin.
He was a slim, wide-faced youth with agreeable
expression, immaculate ducks, straw hat and tan
boots. She was small and restless-eyed, and gave
an impression of untidiness in spite of her gay
European dress and poppy-trimmed hat. Her
shiny black plait of hair —which was tied with
blue ribbon—and her just “ off the ground ” skirt
proclaimed her as still in her teens.
Algermon held a nicely-bound book in his hands,
and presented it to the girl. Also, he kissed a
weakly-looking baby and a round dozen or so of
shaded, whity-brown children who, with a tall,
raw-boned Scotchwoman, seemed to belong to
Floraline’s party.
Half-way down the steps he stopped and called
out to her that he would come to every ship from
England next year to see if she was there; but by
that time Miss Floraline was busily engaged in
ingratiating herself with her fellow-passengers,
and there was no response to his words. A few
moments more and he was hidden from view by
the brilliant sarongs of the boatman. Then a big,
grey man-o’-war swung in between our whitening
wake and the shore, and very soon the gay harbor
and the green and red and gold of the island had
faded into the blue of the Orient sea.
“I don’t envy you,” said the pretty German
baroness, who was gazing shorewards beside me.
“We have too much cafe au lait on board now,
and it is all down near your cabin. There are 12
children in that family, counting the black girl,
who is the daughter of an ayah, I believe, and
accompanies them to look after the baby. Ah !
you will have no peace now !”
And to my horror I found her words were true.
The family arranged themselves in two cabins
opposite to mine, and, being unused to travel of
any kind, were in a hopeless muddle from
the first. Things were not improved by the
fact that Miss Floraline chose to regard the
stewards as “ low-caste whites who worked,” and
spoke to them accordingly. Continuous alterca-
tions were the result, and much interchange of
personal opprobrium, necessitating the captain’s
interference once or twice.
Fair Floraline introduced herself to me by the
simple expedient of walking into my cabin and
sitting down on my hat-box.
“ I saw you at Colombo,” she said. “I sup-
pose you were as glad to get away from so hor-
rible a place as I was ? ”
“Do you not like the town?” I said ab-
stractedly. She was rubbing her shiny pigtail
against the folds of my white satin kimono, and
I was wondering how I could rescue it without
hurting her feelings.
“Oh, the place is all right,” she said conde-
scendingly. “ It’s the black people are so bad—
real bad people,” she added impressively.
I expressed surprise, but Floraline was convinc-
ing in her eloquence. She told me how the
Cingalese rickshaw runners decoyed helpless pas-
sengers into the wilds of the Cinnamon Gardens,
and stole their valuables at the point of the knife;
how they quarrelled and fought and stabbed
amongst themselves ; and further back (to prove
their inherent wickedness) how the kings of
Kandy had found their chief amusement in grind-
ing little babies into powder between big mill-
stones !
By this time 1 had unhooked my kimono deftly,
and was able to give more attention to her narra-
tive. I looked properly shocked, but said I
liked what I had seen of the race—“ they were so
cheerful and clean, and looked so gentle.”
Floraline’s strange little face became illumi-
nated, and she showed all her white teeth in a
flashing smile, but she watched me still with a
crafty eye. “ Are you quite sure you like them
—those Cingalese ? ” she said.
Yes, I was quite sure.
“ Well, I'll tell you something to surprise you,”
she cried. “ I’m a Cingalese ! ”
I saw that I was expected to be incredulous, so
I said, “ Really ! ” and she grew voluble and told
me her family history. She was not an ayah’s
child at all, but half-sister to the innumerable
little Van Weylens. Her mother, a Kandyan
lady, had married the Dutch tea-planter (who,
judging by his offspring, must have had a touch
of the tar-brush himself), and died at Floraline’s
birth. Then her father married Miss Mactaggart
and died, and the widow Mactaggart-Van Weylen
was now returning to her relatives in the High-
lands. It was in deference to these same Scotch
Mactaggarts that the first mixed marriage was to
be ignored, and she was not to take her place
except as an “adopted "Van Weylen.” How much
or how little of her story was true I cannot say,
but I thought Mrs. Van Weylen an over-confident
and much-mistaken woman if she considered her
secret safe with her Cingalese step child.
Then she informed me that she was 17 years
of age, and had been left a great quantity
of valuable jewels by her mother, who claimed
descent from the ancient kings of Kandy. Judging
by the poverty-stricken aspect of the family in
general, and of Miss Floraline in particular, I
rather doubted the latter statement, but it was
picturesque in its way.
She flopped away on her down-trodden slippers
after a while, only to return with the white-and-
gold-bound volume the young Cingalese had
given her. She was rather coy about it, but
displayed the fly-leaf proudly, whereon was set
forth that this book of Ceylon views is given to
“ Fair Floraline, by her ever devoted sweetheart
Algermon Kutarah Daas, hoping that she will
not forget.” Then he had copied in a clerkly
hand the verses of “ Believe me if all those
endearing young charms.” All these things I
duly admired, while Floraline descanted in her
thick, soft tones of his many virtues and pros-
pects, and deplored the fact that he was not a
travelled person like herself (we were nearing Suez
now, and Colombo was a thing of the past).
“ Yes, I saw him when he came to say good-bye
to you,” I ventured. “He looked a very nice
young fellow, indeed.”
“ Oh, no, you never did !” she interposed. “He
said good-bye to me on the wharf—there were
none of my friends on the ship. Those black
people all came to say good-bye to Mrs. Van
Weylen. Algermon is a Christian, and white as
marble stone. No, indeed ! ”
She was certainly a picturesque liar.
In one way arid another, I saw a good deal of
Miss Floraline after this, for she used to croon the
sickly baby to sleep just outside my door, and
her singing voice was so weirdly beautiful as she
chanted hymns, or trailed off into soft Kandyan
lullabies, that I forgave liei much. Besides, she

SWAGGIE : “ Any chance of a bit of meat, boss?"
COCKY : “ Well, I can't spare any meat, but I’m going to kill a pumpkin to-night, an’ you
can have the innards! ”
presented rather rtn interesting problem to any
one desirous of studying race instinct. Alger-
mon’s insuperable drawback in her eyes was his
lack of the saving grace of a drop of white
blood to match her own, and I felt pretty sure
that he would stand a poor chance of retaining
her affections if any white rival appeared on the
scene.
She told me with Pagan callousness that two of
her aunts on the mother’s side were afflicted with
Ceylon sore mouth —a disease which is only cur-
able by a removal from the island. “ They must
die,” she announced triumphantly, and then she
would “only have white relationsleft.” And so joy-
ful did the thought make her that she broke forth
into the Old Hundredth, sending her beautiful
voice ringing through the saloon, until even the
scornful stewards, who objected to being ordered
about by “black trash,” were fain to listen and
admire.
Our approach to Suez was heralded by a storm,
and the whole Van Weylen family were very sea-
sick. Floraline alone, with her heart set on
Scotland, refused to add her voice to the general
wail which expressed their wish to be back in
Ceylon. A cold spell set in on the north side of the
canal, and she was exceedingly distressed at the
necessity for unpacking her warm things. “ Scot-
land would be very cold, they had heard, and the
wraps were meant for that country,” and she
folded the faded plush opera cloak about her
shivering shoulders with sad resignation. A
moth-eaten fur tippet was also her share, and the
winter garments of the rest of the children were
worth looking at.
The deceased Dutch tea-planter, with the trace
of the tar brush, had not left his family well pro-
vided for, and sympathetic friends had come to
the rescue and supplied much of the travelling
outfit from forgotten stores of Cold Country
things. The eldest boy wore a tartan plaid, fas-
tened with a safety pin. His brother next in age
sported a velvet jacket of feminine cut, with wide
sleeves and a shaped waist, and the other “steps
and stairs” were as fearfully and wonderfully
clothed. They were good little souls, the whole
eleven of them, and looked after each other with
great devotion, while the raw-boned widow lay
in her berth and read penny novelettes until the
cold spell passed.
As the voyage drew to an end, fair Floraline
began to have some prescience of her fate in the
future household where the Mactaggarts were to
dominate, and she inquired anxiously if there
were any “low-caste” whites in Scotland to do
the work for their rice and sixpence a week, as in
sunny Ceylon. “I’m not going to do it,” she
declared rebelliously. “ I’m going to have a good
time, and see the king and queen, and enjoy my-
self in Scotland. It’s a grand country and there
will be plenty of fun.” Alas, poor Floraline ! It
was a case of the Heathen in his blindness for all
her Anglophobia.
I left the boat at Genoa, so did not witness the
disembarkation of the Van Weylens on a raw
March afternoon at Southampton, whence they
took train for London and North Britain. But
Floraline had my name in her birthday book and
my address, and she wrote to me twice on flashy
pink paper with forget-me-nots stamped in the
corner —one of the faithful Algermon’s gifts doubt-
less. The first letter told me that she was very
cold. They were all frozen to the bone (poor,
tropical-bred children), and the Misses Mac-
taggart were very great Christians, and did not
think it right to have fun. Still, she thought
Scotland a grand place, ever so much better than
Ceylon, and the summer would come soon. If I
was going back to Australia soon she hoped I
would see Algermon on the wharf at Colombo as I
passed, and I was to tell him from her that she
was quite happy, and meant to live always in
“a Christian country.” With a happy forget-
fulness of her assertion regarding his color, she
finished by saying that I could tell him she had
left off writing to him because she “could never
marry a Cingalese ! ”
So I was fain to believe that her precocious
charms had attracted another admirer. Perhaps
the Misses Mactaggart had tidied her up—perhaps.
But then there was little use in speculating where
fair Floraline’s statements were concerned, for
the truth was never in her except by accident.
The second letter arrived almost a year after-
wards—close on to the time when I was thinking
of returning to my own sunny country by way of
the Red Sea again, but this time the blotted,
tear-stained pages rang true.
Fair Floraline was ill in a London hospital
with “ the consumption.” She would be better
of course in the summer, but the doctors said she
must not travel yet, and she was afraid Mrs. Van
Weylen would return without her. Beside, she
had no money, and it was better that Algermon
should come and fetch her—he would be waiting
at every steamer now that the year was up. The
whole letter was a wail whose refrain “I want to
go back ” filled me with pity. I took a cab and
sought the hospital to which fate and the Misses
Mactaggart had relegated her. Matters were
much as she had represented them. The cold of
the bleak North had been too much for the fragile,
little Eurasian, and she was in a galloping con-
sumption, with the symptoms well advanced,
'i There would be no going home for Floraline, but
she was feverishly hopeful, and her long practice
of self-deception stood her in good stead now. I
promised to see Algermon and give him any
message, and was entrusted with the precious
book of views as a means of identification. If I
asked for him, she said I had better inquire for
one Rama Katurah Daas, as Algermon was only
a Christian name he had taken at her desire.
She had no doubt whatever that her discarded
lover would at once answer to her call.
I kept her well supplied with fruit and flowers
and little comforts during the next few weeks,
and listened to her description of the red-roofed
bungalow in the tamarind grove on the Mount
Lavinia Road which Algermon had promised her—
and still babbling of the tamarind groves and scarlet
hibiscus flowers of the far spice island, fair Flora-
line grew strangely weak one afternoon, and when
she fell asleep it was not to waken. She died,
like the little Pagan she was at heart, with the
name of her dusky lover and a dreamy love-song
on her lips, instead of one of the hymns which
have been specially arranged for such occasions in
the “ Ancient and Modern ” she was so fond of.
* * * *
Algermon was waiting on the wharf, of course—
white or colored, there are certain natures upon
which the hall mark, “faithful unto death,” has
been stamped indelibly. The little book conveyed
its own message, and his stricken face anticipated
my story ; but I think he was a good deal com-
forted to think that “ fair Floraline ” had wanted
to return to him after all. With Asiatic stoicism,
he bowed his head to the inevitable, and, thanking
me, walked away. He was a pure-blooded Cinga-
lese, and there was no unstable blending of white
and black to sow dissension in his nature, as in
the case of fair Floraline, whose worthless young
life had mercifully ended before she had time to
break his heart. I heard the whole history of her
stay in Scotland, and the details were not edify-

SPRING TIME
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
SPRING is here, and it is sweet
Low to lie at lady's feet,
Lingering, pouting lips to taste,
Close to press the yielding waist.
Men, beware !
It is rare
That she be as fond as fair.
In the half-light of the eve,
When the shades your sight deceive,
As the western radiance dies,
Eyes are looking into eyes.
Then take care
How you fare
Lest she catch you unaware.
'Neath the wilga's drooping shade,
Where the lover's rest is made,
In the dim, seductive park,
Forms are flitting after dark ;
Then ft is
For a kiss
Men would barter future bliss.
Girls, when burning whispers sound,
Bend your glances to the ground,
Make your answer swift and short.
Half are lies, and half are sport;
Men are snakes,
Marriage takes
All the bliss from bridal cakes.
♦ ♦ ♦ ♦ ♦
Ah! 'tis useless. Girls are girls ;
Youth and love's hot madness whirls
Fever-heat within the heart;
Love, and mind not after-smart;
Kiss and play
While you may,
Death will catch you all some day.

The Brown Man’s Burden.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I CHANT the brown man’s trouble,
His incubus of woe;
The things to bend him doubl-;
That on his shoulders go;
The needy white invaders,
Of methods underhand,
Glib parsons, priests and traders,
Who prey throughout his land.
I sing his song of sorrow—
Though would ’twere better sung—
He foreign aid must borrow
Who cannot speak our tongue ;
And I, who know brown brother,
Although my speech is weak,
Don’t care to watch him smother
And die, without a squeak.
It wearies me to madness
To hear so much about
The heathen fellow’s badness
Before we found him out.
I would not be a scoffer,
But qualms of conscience vex,
What is it that we offer
For all that we annex?
We say “He sits in blindness,”
And off our envoys roam
To prate of “ truth ” and “ kindness,”
And such things, rare at home.
Ah, till our folk are willing
To practise as they preach,
Why need they fuss, fulfilling
Their self-found “call ” to teach?
Blind leaders of the darkened—
For what does either know ?
And ill-starred race that hearkened,
Deluded, to a foe !
Theft, vice, and decimation
Behind our bibles rage ;
They pay for their “ salvation ”
With life and heritage ;
While sect on sect confuses
Their backward intellects,
As sect on sect abuses
All of the other sects
With rancor unabating,
Each tongue a stinging rod,
Each one another hating,
just for the love of God.
Oh, “we know not division,”
And “ all one body we ! ”
I guess we earn derision
More often than we see !
But “civilising,” canting,
And grabbing all he can,
The Christian moves, supplanting
The Polynesian.
So, through the South Pacific,
From isle to isle to-day,
The pastor is prolific,
Though fast the flocks decay.
The white man fumes and preaches,
The brown makes muffled moan—
“ There are not any beaches
That I can call my own.”
Such hordes of missionaries !
They take his all away.
He has no cassowaries
To save him from their sway.
He has no cassowary
His parasites to eat,
Though once his own Small Mary
Was equal to the feat
Aye, when the world was younger,
And ships of war were few,
How savory, in hunger,
Was papalangi* stew !
More pleasing far than fishes
To the Kanaka taste,
Or vegetable dishes
Like yam and taro paste.
Or if, as happened rarely,
Some visitor was kept,
Such labored late and early
While a brown master slept.
Respectful in behaviour,
He fetched, and carried too,
And fended for his saviour
As serfs have got to do.
But long these days are over,
And Time’s revenge is black ;
The white man lives in clover,
The brown one bears the pack.
He travails as the helot
(Where once he bossed the show)
For some perfervid zealot
Who kindly lends the hoe.
He learns how much ’tis better
To give than to receive,
And, gifted with the fetter,
Is able to believe
His teachers tell him truly,
And, verily, is not
Puffed up at all unduly
About what he has got.
So hear the brown man’s tangi,
A swan-song sort of lay.
Of too much papalangi
He fades and pines away :
His hold on life grows lighter,
And no one seems to care,
Though there are niggers whiter
We might much better spare.

Carnival.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
WHEN the gods keep carnival strayed we
together to Pleasure Land
Where red lamps swing in the branch-
ing tree,
And the grass is white with confetti,
By gilded gates and tinselled walls we entered the
pleasaunce hand in hand.
You twined wreaths in my loosened hair—you who
were glad with youth and Spring,
We cast behind us Convention’s load,
We left the way of the bare straight road
To pluck at lavish summer blooms, to hear mad
birds in the thickets sing.
We left behind the warning hand, the crow’s feet
under wise old eyes,
We left the corn and the grain of toil
For gaudy growths of another soil,
Poppy petals which make men dream strange
dreams beneath the rocking skies.
Where moonlight struggled with the lamps,
checked black and white on the deep-grassed
lawn,
We loved with love that was sweet and free,
The love of butterfly and of bee,
And the high note of carnival rang all the night
from dark to dawn.
Where the gods keep carnival strayed we together
from Pleasure Land;
The lights burned black in the swinging tree,
The feet had trampled the confetti,
Thro’ gilded gate and tinselled wall we went
from the pleasaunce hand in hand.
With tinsel clinging to you still, you hold your
tired arms to me,
But I see you now with different eyes,
Like a lost bird ’neath alien skies,
My heart cries for the old straight road and for
the friend that you used to be !

Squatter Taylor.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
WE picked each other up in a casual
way. Salvo Jim and I took the road
together out of Deniliquin after a
week’s acquaintance. We came across old Bill,
camping, very comfortable and very hearty, a
day or two later, and chummed in.
He was a jolly fellow, whereas Jim and I were
pretty quiet. He was up to all the tricks of the
road, and everything else. And he was nearly old
enough to be our father, but with more life and
spirit than the two of us put together.
He never got rid of a snatch of a song he’d
heard somewhere. “So! So ! Ma’moselle, a
countess you will be ! ’’—was all he knew of it, and
he’d blurt it out now and then, to cheer himself
up or to express his overflowing happiness under
difficulties.
We could never sum up Bill altogether. Of
course, you don’t cross-examine a man, and ask
what he is or who—that can come after, or go
hang, as the case may be. There’s such a differ-
ence in men that way ; some ’ll tell you
all about themselves—most of it lies,
perhaps—as soon as they see you, and
others —why, you never know them,
not if you’ve knocked round with
them for years.
Now, Salvo Jim, although rather
a silent man, you soon got to
know—how he was born at Red
Bluff, and grew up farming there,
and then went to Melbourne,
n.nn am
and worked on
the sewers, and
then was at
Deniliquin, etc.
—not because he
talked much, but
what he said was
all about these
things, and be-
cause to him the
great things in
the world were
these things.
When there
are two or three
(or 50 or 100 for
that matter)
gathered to-
gether, one says
“We’ll do this,”
or that, and you
do it. There is
no debate—the
boss just falls
into his place, and
the others feel
he’s right, and do
what he says. Bill talked and
Bill led.
But he didn’t talk much about
himself.
There was only one thing I could fix on as re-
gards Bill with any cocksureness, and that was
that, even if he had been bushing for years, he had
been a cockney some time or other in his life. He
was always saying “half a tick,” “snuff it,” “on
his crust,” “up to Dick,” “ do it up a treat,” “bad
as they make ’em,” “hot ’un,” “his little joke,”
and things like that.
It’s the things grained into a man that stick,
and I reckoned he’d originally come from London,
but how long it was since he had left there, or
whether he had ever been married, or whether he
was a sailor, farmer, digger, or all of them, with
all his talk we never got much nearer to it.
He was the best bushman of the party by a lot,
but seemed to do the maddest things at times just
for a lark, and with as much object as if he was
on the road for the mere fun of being there. He
actually laughed once when we came to a creek
and found it dry. But his stiffest prank was when
he got us off the main track and led us into doing
a thirty-mile stretch, without a single house or
shed in it all the way.
We did have a debate about turning off the
road, but he was confident; he thought he’d been
in the country before, and knew of a cut. We
were out of both tea and tobacco at the time.
Salvo Jim’s trousers had all along consisted of
a few good, sound patches on an unhealthy frame-
work that got threadier every day, and about five
miles on his skinned heel swelled, and he had to
cut off the back of his boot.
He and I were not penniless, if Bill was. Jim
had a pound, and I had a bob or two, and we
wanted to strike a road where we might come
across some passers-by. But we followed Bill, all
the same.
“It was all right,” he said. He also said he
had some tobacco. He had said it before, and it
seemed strange he didn’t produce the tobacco, as
we hadn’t smoked that morning.
I don’t know whether Salvo Jim thought the
same as I did or not, but it crossed my mind that
Bill had two or three times fought shy of the high-
ways and byways, and that perhaps he was on
the cronk in some way. We neither of us said
anything about it, but I wondered, and I think
Jim did.
After a bit, Bill took out the piece of tobacco
that he’d nursed so long and made such a song
about, and I saw at a glance that in the whole of
it there was just about enough for one good smoke.
We gathered round while he cut it up into thin
slices and rolled it, putting it on a smooth place
on a log, and then with his knife he carefully
divided it into three equal heaps. It was won-
derful how he’d made each of the three heaps look
like a comfortable pipeful—till we dropped the
stuff into our bowls.
We all lit up together, and bravely started off
again, blowing glorious blue clouds as if nothing
at all was the matter. Those few whiffs soon
made a couple of miles spin by, and when the
tobacco was quite gone we went on “dry
smoking. ”
Salvo Jim and I didn’t care now for anything
We were “set” and ready to endure the worst.
To have gone back in the heat over miles of
waste, and retrace our steps to the main road was
not to be thought of. The uncertainty ahead was
better ; so we followed Bill. He went on exactly
as usual, not caring a damn, and as if he knew
every inch of the way.
He had to bluff it somehow ; it was his trick,
and we’d got to crawl on while we could crawl.
He stood it better than we did. He was a man
getting on for sixty, but a man of iron. The old
humbug kept on ahead, trolling his infernal “So,
so, Ma’moselle,” or turning now and then to give
a cheery coo-ee back to us.
Poor old Jim would hear him as he was toiling
after: “ Getting a bit light-headed on it,” he’d say,
looking at me, and tapping his own head signifi-
ILL-TIMED.
TRAVELLING PHOTO.-MAN : “ Would you like
your picture taken to-day, madam? ”
cantly, “It’s a good way to take it. Them as
thinks, and thinks deep, and can’t get away from
trouble are in a worse case, but it runs off a man
that’s a shingle short like water.”
Of course, we didn’t keep all of a bunch.
Sometimes we wouldn’t see Bill for as much as an
hour or so, only hear him now and again until we
come on him in the shade somewhere, or saw him
going up some hill ahead.
And then I’d be ahead of Salvo Jim, who, with
his gammy foot, would be moving gingerly behind
most of the time, until I’d wait for him to come
up. There wasn’t much talk or singing about Jim,
He kept his boots off now, and wished he was
dead.
Altogether we got over that stretch by sticking
the more desperately to it the weaker we got, for
fear we wouldn’t live to finish it. And at last
towards next evening we struck a road we knew
nothing about. We had a talk about which way
led to the nearest humanity. Salvo Jim and I

BOB : “ Nothin’ but the Chow he found in his
tent the first day.”
were for south, but Bill decided for north, and
we, of course, followed. It turned out good
enough, for presently we met a man riding.
Old Bill deliberately kept behind some scrub
while the man passed, but Jim and I bailed him
up and got some tobacco. He said we’d get all
else we wanted at Taylor’s—less than a mile ahead.
After he had ridden off Bill said “I told you
so,” but he said nothing about himself keeping
out of sight.
So we were all right after that, and lit up and
went along, and soon heard dogs barking near
real posts and rails, and found a slip panel at the
corner. Old Bill stopped there to fuss about
something that he’d got into his boot, and told
Salvo Jim and me to go up to the house and see
what we could get, and he’d follow on. And
when we went up such a boss place I never saw.
“Squatter Taylor’s” they called it, and they
made a habit of entertainin’ angels unawares—at
least you’d think so by the way they took us in.
We sat down to a table in the kitchen that had
all we could want on it—pie, pork, beef, pastry,
and lashings of hot tea.
But Bill didn’t turn up, and we didn’t like
that. I got up in the middle of it all to go out
and hunt up our mate at the sliprails and see
what kept him ; but, just as I had expected, both
he and his swag had disappeared. He’d slipped
us up, and it was all of a piece with his keeping
away from strangers. There was something
wrong. Perhaps “Squatter Taylor” was a
magistrate, and Bill had good reason for avoiding
him. Salvo Jim and I never said a word about
him, but nearly cried, as we tucked in, about the
good things Bill was missing.
We did have a blow-out, and afterwards a man
asked if we wouldn’t sit out on the verandah and
smoke. It was a wide verandah that ran all
round the house, but he took us right round to
the front and best part of it, where even in that
light you could see there was a view over miles
and miles of the estate.
The man could see Jim’s foot wasn’t all right,
so he drew up one of those long laying-down easy
cane chairs, and we smoked on there in the de-
licious cool, and marvelled again about Bill and
what he’d missed.
Then presently we sniffed other tobacco besides
ours—cigars, the sort that captains of the big
boats smoke. The smell came from the room
behind us, which was all lit up, and had two
large windows. Then Salvo Jim said in a voice
that made me start —
“Look !”
I didn’t know where he meant, and looked out
over the darkness, and could only see the stars
and the landscape.
“No I—not1 —not there! Inside,” he whispered.
I had cast a glance in there before—a fine large
room, with plenty of furniture, a tall, well-filled
bookcase at the end of it, and on the side oppo-
site to us a large velvet pile divan that a family
could sleep on —a gentleman’s library the place
was. Now, moving my head a bit, there was the
gentleman in it, sitting at the head of the long
table all by himself, smoking, with glass and
decanters before him.
“ It’s Bill,” said Jim.
Well, we’d left Bill grubby and ragged, with
long, grizzly hair all round his face, and here was
a well-groomed man with his beard cut to a point,
and a pair of gold-rimmed pince-nez, looking just
like the King of England, only a d r .rned sight
finer cut. Side-face on as I was I could only see
a very partial resemblance, if any, let alone the
absurdity of it, but it was Bill’s face, neverthe-
less. Although I thought myself a lot smarter
than Salvo Jim (and do now), he found that out
first, anyhow.
But even when I saw through all the grooming
that the face was Bill’s—even then I got no
nearer than figuring out that it might beabrother
of Bill’s or something, and that that was the
reason he had kept away, perhaps—until, holding
the cigar be-
tween two fing-
ers, and pouring
whisky into a
glass with the
other hand, he
gives out in that
rollicking bass
of his, “ So,
so, Ma’moselle.”
Then Salvo Jim
burst out in a
loud guffaw, that
made him look
to the window
where we were.
He couldn’t
keep his own
face straight,
and at last he
sang out, in ex-
actly his old
w ay, “Why
cjon’t you come
inside ? Why do
you stop out
there all night
and be so un-
sociable ? ” And
so we went in.
Of course it
was Bill, and
Bill was Squat-
ter Taylor, just
having a lark
with us.
We put in the
shearing there,
and Salvo Jim still works on the place, and
has never been swagging since.
But Bill has. Every now and then he claps on
old things and humps it, but he has to go further
and further away now to do it. Everyone knows
Squatter Taylor’s games, and some used to lay
for him, so he has to find new parts.'
Often it’s given out he’s gone to England, but
he hasn’t. He’s just doing a turn on the wallaby
somewhere, without a shilling—that’s his fancy.
It’s the fondness for the old life that he can’t
get rid of.
I wouldn’t mind going with him again sometimes,
but he doesn’t do that—he likes to come across
them casually. He’s picked up scores and scores of
chaps so, and soon there’ll be no more swaggies—
they’ll all be on Squatter Taylor’s station.

A Song of Wind.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
HARK to the song of the scattering,
scurrying,
Blustering, bullying, bellowing, hurrying
Wind !
Over the hills it comes, laughing and rollicking,
Curling and whirling, flying and frolicking,
Spinning the clouds that are scattered and
thinned,
And shouting a song
As it gallops along—
A song that is nothing but wind.
Waking the willows that hang their leaves list-
lessly,
Bending the poplars it roars on resistlessly—
Wind !
In the long grass on the slopes, as it passes, it
Billows and waves and scatters and masses it,
Shaking the fences so solidly pinned,
And howling a song
That is noisy and strong—
A song that is nothing but wind.
Down the long roadway it sends the leaves
fluttering,
Turns the old folk about, angry and stuttering,
“ W-w-wind ! ”
Clasping the laughing girls lightly and easily
It plays with the lifted skirt gaily and breezily,
Scorning all laws in man’s ears ever dinned,
And whispers a song
That is risque and wrong—
A song that is nothing but wind.
When the leaves of the autumn are falling and
yellowing
We hear the wild song of the bullying, bellowing
Wind.
It leaps from its lair at a pace that is passionate,
And rends the soft clouds that have aided to
fashion it—
Thrashing them fiercely, as slaves who have
sinned,
With its many-lashed thong,
And yelling a song—
A song that is nothing but wind.
This is the song of the galloping, hurrying,
Gusty, and dusty, and whirling, and worrying
Wind.
Over the hills it comes laughing and rollicking,
Yelling, and swooping, and flying, and frolicking,
Shaking the fences so solidly pinned,
And shrieking a song
As it gallops along—
A terrible song that is wind.

Children of the Gulf.
THE LORD OF LONG PIG ISLAND.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
ALWAYS had a ’igh regard for dooks
until Cap’n Hayes pisened my mind. It
’appened the year before Hayes got into
trouble over the Daphne job. He was standin’
on Lindermanif s verandah, watchin’ Lord Blitch-
field’s yacht nosin’ the pure air inside Apia har-
bor. Her brass cleats an’ silver-plated hand-rails
put a shine in his eye. They said her cutlery an’
cabin fittin’s was worth fifty tons of shell.
Her crew was a pretty tired lot, drawin’-room
officers an’ mainsheet dudes. His lordship was
a stout, slow-breathin’ man with a pear-shaped
’ead an’ pointed ears. We heard that his income
was wheeled out every month in a barrer.
The sight of the shiny, schooner-rigged yacht
set Hayes paddin’ like a big tiger up an’ down
the trade house verandah. “ ’Ave a drink,” says
lie to me an’ his mate Cummins. “Fizz or square
face ? ”
“Make it British an’ lager, cap’n,” says the
mate. “Too much fight an’ froth in that Cali-
fornian wine.”
Hayes opened the drinks. “English dook
aboard that picture-boat,” says he. “ Blamed fat
man, with bells on his toes. Got a gold dog-vane
at his masthead. Wonder how often the Bank
of England lets him out ? ” Hayes yawned at us,
an’ his teeth showed like the points of a tin-
opener through his beard.
“What yer thinkin’ about, cap’n?” says the
mate, quick as light.
“Boodle an’ calves’-feet jelly,” says Bully.
“My schooner’s in pawn, an’ my feet want
mendin’.”
The three of us looked ’ard at the beer for a
minute. The mate knoo that Hayes wasn’t to be
trusted with a ten dollar mangle. An’ when it
came to business square an’ honest, Bully always
wanted to lick the ice off the cake afore it was
cool. The mate said nuflfin’.
Bully squared his shoulders. “I’ve sclilan-
lered Chows, an’ took niggers for ballast,” says
he ; “ but I never bit more than my share.”
“P’raps you ’aven’t,” says the mate; “but I’ve
always noticed, capt’n, that when you an’ the
other chap are makin’ a bee-line for gaol, you
manage to stay outside.”
“See here,” says Bully, clappin’ him on the
shoulder, “ Lord Blitchfield is cornin’ ashore to be
entertained. I can get the loan of Lindermann’s
launch ; an’ I’m goin’ to take him an invitation
from the Consul askin’ him to go for a little trip
round the island. I want to show him Queen
Pomare’s pretty granddaughters. Savvy ? Linder-
mann will lend me some nice clothes, an’ I guess
there isn’t a man in the American navy who can
play the gun-room swell like me.”
His lordship came ashore in the afternoon,bring-
in’ his own wine. I must say he knoo how to
put a ’ead on things. The way he scoffed the
turkey an’ ham was a eye-opener. What he
couldn’t eat he liked, an’ the pile of empty wine
bottles filled a whaleboat. He got aboard the
yacht late that night.
Hayes’ invitation reached him about 10 next
mornin’. His lordship replied immediately, say-
in’ he’d meet Lindermann’s launch at midday.
It was a natty little seaboat. Hayes sat at the
tiller dressed in white naval twill, an’ when Lord
Blitchfield appeared Bully began apologising for
the Consul’s absence.
“I ’ope my moselle didn’t give him a headache,”
says his lordship, shakin’ hands with Bully.
IT HURT HIS DIGNITY.
THE EMU (sympathetically): “ It must be very painful to have that thing on your tail, ’Roo?”
THE 'ROO : “ It’s terribly galling to a kangaroo of my standing to be taken for a wretched rabbit.”
Hayes made a little speech about the pleasure
it give him to ’ave Lord Blitchfieid for a guest,
Then he guffed an’ played dude with his morocco
cigar-case until his lordship fairly beamed.
My missus was there, wavin’her gamp as we put
off from the steps. The weather was all sirgarnio,
an’ the mate, with lager beer in his voice, volun-
teered a song. Hayes said he’d sooner ’ear a
poisoned dog chasin’ its last note round a Ger-
man band. That made his lordship laugh. He
told us that Captain Hayes was a bright, critical
fellow-.
Bully replied in a few gentlemanly words,
sayin’ that his lordship had been born on the right
day, with silver speech an’ fine linen in his mouth
—or somethin’ like that.
The mate was out of it. He’d have said
“Thanks” if Bully had hit him w-ith a plate of
prawns. We ’ad a light an’ airy time between
drinks. His lordship officiated with the cold
chicken. He was a big-necked man, an’when he
swallowed the red jelly his ears seemed to lie
against his pear-shaped ’ead. Hayes whispered
to me that it was on account of his ancestors ’avin’
to hide the eatables whenever his uncle Dan, in
the wolf-skin coat, crawled into the family cave.
Half way betweeen Apia an’ Hurricane Reef,
the steerin’ gear took a fit. We swung about for
two hours, Hayes swearing at Lindermann for
allowing a party of gentlemen to put to sea in an
unmanageable craft. Slamming over the rudder,
he sent her full steam ahead, and trusted to luck.
His lordship was half drunk by this time, an’
he asked if we were taking him to hell or the
South Pole.
“Guess he’ll be glad to swap places for an ice-
chest in Sheol when his time comes,” whispered
Bully to me.
The launch jibbed again an’ made a line for the
S.E. We let her go until a white blob of reef
showed ahead an’ the roar of breakers got in our
ears. A few ragged palms cut the sky-line. Lord
Blitchfield sat up an’ started to admire the scenery
through his gold-rimmed binoculars.
There wasn’t a hut ora sign of life from sea-line
to reef. A few birds hung about the lagoon.
The sand heaps ahead had a hungry look. The
loneliness began to get on our nerves. Bully
gritted his teeth and drove the launch through
the reef opening to the still waters inside.
His lordship was first out of the launch, blinkin’
at the sky an’ sniffin’ the air like a big sleepy cat.
“ What demned place is this ? ” says he.
Hayes ran his eye over the atoll and the bare
starve-me-quick hummocks around us. “Even if
we could repair our rudder,” says he, “we
wouldn’t have enough coal to carry us half-way
back to Apia. An’ if we stay here we’ll make a
skeleton-heap. I should think,” he says, starin’
hard at Blitchfield, “that your lordship would
make a dignified heap of bones if the wind blew
through you for a couple of years.”
His lordship sat on the beach an’ smiled ; then
he wiped his lips like a man out of hospital.
“ How far are we from Apia ?” says he.
“ There’s enough water between us an’ Apia to
drown Europe,” says Bully. “Eighteen miles I
make it, my lord. We’re dead off the track of
schooners. I guess Lindermann ought to raffle
his unholy water squirt.”
We hauled the launch high an’ dry, an’ slept in
it that night. “If this is the cap’n’s joke,” says
the mate to me, “it’s a derned poor one.”
We ’ad half a bottle o’ brandy for breakfast, an’
Blitchfield began to rave about the chicken bones
we’d thrown overboard. There was a cold,
hungry feelin’ in the sky ; the birds looked thin
an’ worn, an’ wouldn’t let us get within gunshot.
We baited a line, an’ it brought in a crowd of
ravenous sharks that hung about the reefs all day,
until his lordship asked us to shy rocks at ’em.
Then his lordship took to stridin’ up an’ down
the beach, blowin’ out his cheeks an’ wringin’ his
hands. His eyelids seemed to thicken; he ran
away every time Hayes walked near him.
Third mornin’ was the worst. Bully gave me
an’ the mate the tip where to find a tin o’ beef an’
sardines ; but he threatened to shoot us both if he
saw us sharin’ it with Blitchfield.
“Goin’ to sell him some, cap’n?” asked the
mate.
“ Yah !” snapped Hayes. “He’d gunboat me
first time we got to port if I played that dog-trick
on him.”
At moon-up Lord Blitchfield began to fret like
a woman with toothache. He crawled over to
Hayes, an’ began to whisper somethin’. Bully
hugged his knees in the sand an’ listened.
“My lord,” says he, “ we’re doin’ an ugly
famish. We might get taken off by a canoe or
steamer, but the chances are remote. The man
isn’t born who could put to sea in a launch without
oars,-or sails, or steerin’gear. No one will pre-
vent you trying, if you care to risk it, my lord.”
Blitchfield shook his head an’ grunted some-
thin’.
“ What ! ” says Hayes. “ Would you ? ”
His lordship crawled behind Bully an’ pointed
at me. Hayes nodded twice, an’ the two sat there
like a pair of owls watchin’ me.
“Hullo ! ” says the mate to me. “ What’s the
game? Long pig?”
Hayes came over suddenly. “I’ve settled it
with Lord Blitchfield,” he says. “ We’re goin’ to
have you for dinner. Bill. I hope you ain’t goin’
to make a fuss.”
“ Not if you lay plenty of sauce under my right
wing, cap’ll,” says I.
While Blitchfieid was groanin’ in the sand,
Hayes creeps round to the launch an’ hauls out a
parcel from under the for’rd planks. I sniffs,
an’ my mouth begins to water. “ Cold roast pork,
cap’n,” says I.
“ Pork it is, William,” says he. “Come along
to the back beach.” I followed him abouta mile ;
then he took out a pistol an’ fired it in the air.
“ What’s that for ? ” says I.
“ Your funeral, Bill,” says he. “Lord Blitch-
field is now aware that you ’ave departed this life
for the cookin’ stones. He ixpects you served up
’ot an’ steamin’ within an hour after the shot.”
“ ’E don’t know much about cookin’,” says I.
We lit a fire between some stones, an’ heated
the pig in less than half-an-hour. “Here’s a bit
for you, Bill,” says he, handin’ me a junk. “You’d
better not show yourself to his lordship again.”
Blitchfieid was waitin’ with his back to the
lagoon when Hayes bustled up with the heap of
roast pork. He stood up, an’ the mate said his
eyes bulged like door-knobs,
“’Ow will you’ave him, my lord,” says Bully;
“ stoo’d or fried ? ” “
“ B’iled,” says Blitchfieid, turnin’ away.” “ Oh.
’Ayes, ’Ayes,” he sez, “ the situation is ’orrible.”
“ Bill’s no chicken, my lord,” says Bully, layin’
the dish on the beach. “ He’s led a ’ard life
tearin’ up an’ down riggin’s an’ fightin’ bailiffs.”
“ You should ’ave haled him,” says Blitchfieid,
gently. “ B’ilin’ was best.”
“’Ave the rest of him curried on Friday, my
THE MARCH OF MAORI CIVILISATION.
lord ; he’ll see us through the week,” says Bully.
His lordship collared his share, an’ ran away
with it along the lagoon. “Don’t look at me,”
he shouts ; “ don’t look at me.”
“ ’Ow did he like me, cap’n?” says I, when
Bully came to the fire for a second ’elpin’.
Hayes stirred up the ashes an’ threw on some
dry sticks. “ His lordship was a bit huffy cause I
didn’t serve onions on yer forehead, Bill,”
“I’ll give him forehead one of these days,”
says I.
“Didn’t like yer at all, Bill,” grunted Bully.
“Says he’ll have to buy a new face afore ’e can
get the taste of yer out of his mouth. An’ the
mate feels glad yer dead.”
“ The mate an’his lordship ain’t off the island
yet, cap’n,” Isays hotly. “I never did Cum-
mins any harm.”
“ His lordship asked me all about yer,” went
on Hayes, kickin’ the fire. “Said yer must ’ave
led a terrible life, Bill, when ’ot stones wouldn’t
steam the rum out of yer. He thinks yer must
’ave started drinkin’ when yer was quite a little
boy.”
“ Did he ask what religion I was ? ” says I, with
a sneer.
“He did,” says Bully. “An’ when I told him
you were a hard-shell he begged me to pickle the
other half of yer.” And Bully rushed away with
a piece of pig sizzlin’ in the tin.
Next day a big canoe, with four Kanakas an’ a
friend of Hayes’, waltzed into the lagoon, an’
asked Bully if he wanted a tow to Apia. I was
hidin’ in the bit of scrub back o’ the island.
Hayes came over an’ advised me to stay behind.
He left me a bottle o' whisky, an’ promised to
send the launch for me next day. I took some
persuasion to stay behind, but Bully said it would
spoil the show if Blitchfield caught sight of me.
The canoe took the three back to Apia. They
came for me next mornin’, an’ when I landed on
the back beach, near Lindermann’s, Hayes was
waitin’.
“Row in at the trade house. Come an’see,”
says he.
Sneakin’ among the bushes at the back door, I
sees my missus walkin’ up an’ down the veran-
dah, in a tearin’ rage. Lord Blitchfield was
sittin' in a cane chair, holdin’ his face in his
hands, as though he’d got a white pain in his ’ead.
“ If my Bill ain’t ’ere in twenty minutes,” says
my missus, “I’ll see what the perlice think about
it. Half-a-dozen people saw him go with yer the
other mornin’, me Lord. I ’ave me suspicions
that Bill’s come to a bad end.”
Hayes stepped to the verandah, an’ asked her
to be calm. “She’s a poor woman, my lord,
with a reputation for runnin’ after the police,” he
says.
“ Police be damned ! ” cries Blitchfield, holdin’
his face. “ Send her away.”
“Be reasonable, my lord,” whispers Bully.
“She has a mouth like a parrot. If she squeals,
the harbor police will begin to make inquiries.
An’ the American papers will rip you in halves.
Some of those yellow news-busters will refer to you
as the Peer from Long Pig. I’m sure your lord-
ship wouldn’t care to figure in society as the Can-
nibal Count, or some other hijus person.”
Blitchfield listened, an’ rocked in his chair.
“Send her away. Tell her to be quiet,” he
choked.
“ ’Ow much did you say, my lord ?.” Bully bent
over him. “ One thousand pounds, eh ? Not a
shilling too much. You’ll be well rid of her, sir.”
I ’eld my breath when the cheque-book came
out. Blitchfield filled it in, an’ then wiped his
face like a man cornin’ out of the horrors.
Bully helped him into the yacht’s gig, an’
advised him to leave Apia at once. “ That
woman,” he says, pointin’ to my missus, “is the
biggest cadger in the islands.”
My missus was at the bank early next mornin’,
an’ presented the cheque. It was met without a
murmur. Bully was waitin’ outside with a big
nosegay in his buttonhole.
“ Good mornin’, Mrs. Howe,” says he. “I’ll
trouble you for half the boodle, and no squeakin’.”
My missus grips her satchel an’ looks at him
hard. “What was that you said about me bein’
a cadger, last night?” she says coldly.,
“By the Holy !” says Hayes, frothin’ up, “if
you come any nonsense with me, ma’am, you’ll
find your head hangin’ over the thug-end of my

ALBERT DORRINGTON.
Myra.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
r~yKIN McGUINNESS shouts galore,
\ Skin has won a fight;
Frenchy’s wine saloon will roar
Half-way through the night.
Hear the push, above the row,
Yelling in delight;
‘ ‘ What’s the matter with Myra noiv ?
She’s — all — right.”
Vile is the scent of all the liquor base
That gathered is in Frenchy’s parlor gay ;
But neetar ’tis when Myra’s arms embrace,
When Myra’s kisses give it a bouquet.
To-night, it seems with life itself endowed,
Its muddy hue with vivid ruby glows
Whene’er her health in goblets deep is vowed,
Reflecting lights from Myra’s crimson hose.
And so, behind the setting of the scene,
Its cheap vulgarity, its bloom of dirt;
Behind its tawdry trappings, and the sheen
Of Myra’s stained and threadbare satin skirt,
There is a charm that gives some subtle sign
Of something, thrilling deep with joy and grace ;
It is that all—the girl, the push, the wine,
The shop itself—are out of time and place.
It is the age that vulgarises all;
And easy it would be for us to catch
The true romance of it, could we but call
Some power to reach a mighty hand, and snatch
From out that setting all those spirits gay,
And put them where their time and place
should be—
Ten thousand miles, two thousand years, away,
In some stone street of ancient Pompeii.
A spirit sweeps the miles and years aside ;
Beneath the shadow of that smoking hill
The picture is refined and beautified,
Although its features all are with it still.
The scene it strips of all its sordidness,
The rows of garish bottles from the shelf,
Your scarlet stockings and your satin dress,
And leaves you, Myra, glorious, yourself.
The stencilled, chased amphora that you bear
Fills up their cups; and, when you end your task,
Just one green chaplet on your ebon hair,
You sit and sing astride an oaken cask.
The blood still red upon his bare, brown thighs,
Again the dust-dredged gladiator wins,
His spur the glowing of your witching eyes,
His prize the chance to share your precious sins.
Nudentur mimae! and the dance begins,
With Myra, you, enthroned in pride of place
That from the Leopard-clouted audience wins
The loudest cheers for beauty and for grace.
So revelry prevails the evening through,
Till lights burn out and leave one lamp alone ;
And Venus rules until the dawn is due,
When Bacchus comes, supreme, to claim his
own.
Skin McGuinness on his back,
Slumbers on the floor,
Both his eyes are turning black,
Loudly does he snore.
Myra cleaned his pockets out,
Some time through the night,
As she heard him thickly shout
“ She’s — all — right.”

Cain.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
AT the magpie’s call, jumping up from
his bed of bags, Cain steps out of the
stuffy hut and looks at the dawn.
The distant Bush is a dream of color, scent, and
melody. He dives into the shaded pool.
Then, lying naked on the green, sloping bank,
a lithe-limbed, warm-blooded, dream-loving
animal, an earth man, Cain wonders.
“ Surely, though Dad growls, his market garden
were no brighter than this wilderness.”
His mother calls. Cain tramps back sullenly to
the hut.
* * * *
Atso’clock Adamrisesand rouses the family. He
pours 10 drops of water into a rusty tin basin, and,
sluicing the front part of his face, observes, “You
can’t beat a good old wash.” This is Adam’s good
old wash in summer ; in winter time
There is a bustle round the house. The family
is up. Work soon begins.
Abel brings in the cows. The cow-shed consists
of holes in the roof and palings fallen to a tottering
angle. The cow-yard is a mess of abomination.
Abel and Zillah, the eldest daughter, milk, while
Eve strains and sets the milk in dishes in the
sickly dairy,
Cain and his old man put the horses in the
plough.
Oh! the weary round of labor! The Big
Squatter had cast out Adam from his market
garden called Eden, which was doing well, and in
the sweat of his brow was he made to eat home-
made bread till he returned unto the ground. A
struggling cocky, he struck much trouble on the
selection.
Abel takes his lunch in his pocket, and drives
out the cows to grass. He does not return till
sundown.
Zillah feeds the pigs and fowls; waters the
onions ; picks and cases the apricots ; goes through
the hives, heeding not stings, and extracts honey
from the clammy cells. Then she busies herself
for a little about the house.
Eve grinds at the heavy chaffcutter, cutting the
horses’ mid-day feed. The dust gets down her
throat and into her nose and eyes. She returns to
the camp-oven, sweated, fagged, and angry.
“What’s the use?” laugh the jackasses from
the top of an old red gum.
Over a blazing fire Eve cooks Adam’s dinner.
Once, she reflects, Adam was a successful
orchardist, and she was the prettiest woman in
the district. She loved dances and concerts and
picnics. But the Squatter who owned all
the land round Eden evicted them, and turned
the orchard into a sheep run. Stooped by labor,
Adam became as a beast of burden, always in
dread of the monopolistic Squatter.
Eve’s hair is still dark, but coarse ; her hands
are rough with toil ) her skin is sun-parched,
leathery. Her fine spirit is revealed now only in
bitter words.
It is a gloomy household, and there is no joy
in it.
Eve has little time for vain reflection.
“Dinner’s ready,’ cries Zillah.
It is not a dainty meal, but there is a lot of it—
slip-jack, brownie, “spotted dog,” salt junk stew,
fried rabbit, honey roley-poley—all washed down
with buckets of strong, black tea.
They rarely touch butter, eggs, or cream, fresh
fruit or green vegetables. These are for the
market.
After dinner the tillers of the soil go straight
back to work. The women go out under the
blazing sun to hoe vegetables.
At sundown Abel brings back the cows.
When the men knock off, ravenous through the
smell of the newly-turned soil, they are curtly told
that tucker will not be ready till the milking is
done with.
They squat leadenly outside the door and light
their pipes.
The family lives in a four-roomed “ pug” hut,
with an earthen floor. Water is slopped over it
to keep down the dust. The rude table is let into
the floor. The stretchers are made of saplings
and sugar-bags.
Always the rooms are as close a 3 an oven. The
small windows never open. The air is stagnant
and oppressive with many breaths. There is a
vicious buzz of blowflies, and sugar ants crawl
over everything.
The ploughers await tucker, Adam resigned and
apathetic, Cain silent but rebellious.
Cain looks over towards the distant ranges. He
thinks of a free life in a tent and
“Dad,” cries Abel, “ seen a swarm o'bees to-
day.”
Adam looks up. “ We’ll box ’em to-night.”
Cain has a mighty longing to break away, to
roll up his bluey, and travel, travel.
After tea he sits outside and thinks of the world
away from the furrows of the plough. He will
take the track ; he will see men and cities, share
his tucker with trappers and drovers, gather lore
from bushmen. His mother’s spirit is upon him.
He will pitch his tent on the Open Road.
“Better turn in,” growls Adam. “Must be
up early in the morning.”
Cain saw the stars smiling.
Next day there was trouble on the selection.
When working in the field, Cain cuffed his
brother Abel for pulling off his cabbage-tree to
the Squatter. The Squatter liked Abel, who
was a good boy, always looking after cows and
sheep.
“Wool’s the thing,” the old Squatter always
said.
Abel blubbered, rubbing his eyes. The Squat-
ter grew red and wrath, and ordered Cain to clear
out.
Cain, who was getting nothing a week from the
old man, rolled up his blankets and took the
track, a fugitive and a vagabond.
After all, a dirty selection was not the world,
nor Cow the end of all things.
He tramped to the Land of Nod, on the east of
Eden, an unbroken country over the ranges. His
heart expanded. The world was wider than he
had thought, and the spirit of adventure led
him on.
He fixed camp by the creek. He boiled his
billy, and from his open tent the Bush looked
beautiful and mysterious, a miracle.
On the track travellers, shearers, and cattle
men passed him by, and told him strange tales ;
he began to see some of the wonders of the world;
and in the course of time he married a woman of
the woods who had fire and dew in her veins, and
was gay and passionate.
In this land of adventure, far from the muck of
the cow-yard and the frowns and fences of the
Squatter, he lived joyously, his days passing like
many colored dreams.
He never returned home.
And among the descendants of Cain were
Jabal, the father of all such as dwell in tents, and
Jubal, the father of all such as handle the harp
and organ, and Tubal-Cain, the instructor of
every artificer in brass and iron ; the travellers,
poets, artists, rogues, and vagabonds of the
world ; the careless ones who live in the light o’
the sun, and love women and wine and song,
taking no thought of the morrow, but merry and
light-hearted, make the most of the moments as
they pass...
And back on the selection Adam had another
son, Seth, a country lout, slow and methodical as
a working bullock, who put his soul into Cow,
and acquired shares in a Butter Factory, and
paid his rent in advance to the Big Squatter.
And Seth also begat sons and daughters in his
spare time, but the sons and daughters of Seth
went on the land and became cookies.
And so it continues even unto this very day,
LOUIS ESSON.
The Nigger’s Bride.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IN our boarding-house Mrs. Ranji’s de-
votion to her black husband was a standing
joke. She was a little, white-faced, five-
foot-nothing of a woman, and a touch of the tar-
brush showed in her hair and finger-nails, but she
was mostly white—inside and out. The nigger
was black both sides. He had one virtue, how-
ever—he abluted regularly, and his linen and
outer raiment generally were things to wonder at
and admire. They occupied the best room in the
house, for Mrs. Ranji was blessed with wealth.
She clothed her nigger magnificently, and paid
his board regularly. Also in the bigness of
her heart she kept him in sufficient pocket-money
to entertain other women, but, strangely enough,
that never occurred to her. Her adoration of
him, when it wasn’t amusing, was pathetic. It
was when his eyelids drooped at her too pressing
attentions, and the ornament on his top lip rose
in an unspoken sneer, that we happy-go-lucky
folk hated him most. At his slightest attention
her silly little face would flush hotly, and her
black eyes shine happily. Mrs. Ranji was far too
palpably in love.
It was the advent of the big six-foot chorus
girl that caused the interruption. She was an
educated woman with a superb figure and a clever
devil-may-care face, and she marked the re-
splendent nigger for her own on the spot. Curi-
ous how niggers attract some women. On the
day of her coming she smiled languorously at him.
On the next she addressed him as “my Prince.”
After that, when she didn’t call him “darling”
she called him “Ranji.”
Little Mrs. Ranji was a peace-loving woman,
and her greatest weakness, outside her adoration
of the nigger, was her snobbishness. It had some-
how got around the boarding-house that the chorus
girl was the daughter of a man of position. So
she was, though the man of position would have
A HARD CASE.
LAZY DAN : “ Yes, ’ Enery, she's me lawful wedded wife, but she left me, ’ere she is wheelin'

assaulted and battered you right there if you had
said as much to him. Mrs. Ranji’s policy was
never to offend the relative of a man of position, so
for a time she stood the onslaught meekly, but
it will never be known what she suffered.
The rehearsals for the Christmas pantomime
were in full swing, and kept the chorus girl occu-
pied, but on Christmas day she spent the morn-
ing in her room with some cronies, and the
housemaid had remarked on the popping of
corks. We were all in our places when she
entered the dining-room. A sprig of mistletoe
dangled from the chandelier. She stopped
beneath it, and lifting her skirts danced seduc-
tively. Her fine eyes blazed unnaturally, and her
big, bold face was flushed a dull red. Smiling
she continued her dance ; and, looking straight at
the nigger, sang tantalisingly “Will you, won’t
you, will you, won’t you, will you join the”
The nigger’s arms were tight round her. We
could hear him breathing. He was kissing her
with violence.
We watched Mrs. Ranji. She was considering
the menu gravely, and, looking up at the grinning
waitress, she quietly gave her order. The big
six-footer took her seat, laughing viciously. A
remarkable thing about the chorus girl was her
magnificent contempt for Mrs. Ranji. Wild with
the wine she had drunk, she threw daring words
at the nigger, and he, roused from his usual
murky inoffensiveness, hurled ugly things back
at her. We others hurried through the meal,
and left to discuss matters on the balcony. Mrs.
Ranji walked to the end of the passage and
looked for the life. For our boarding-house had
been orginally built for a hotel, and was some-
thing of a skyscraper; also it boasted a lift
which we, as occasion required, worked ourselves,
She opened the wire door and peeped cautiously
into space, Calling shrilly in her high falsetto,
“ Lift! Lift ! Look out ! ” before she pulled the
rope to bring the cumbrous thing to her. As she
started for the upper floor the nigger and the
chorus girl entered the sitting-room immediately
behind her. The girl threw herself on the couch
and lit a cigarette; the nigger took a palm-leaf
from the wall and fanned her assiduously.
He was bending to kiss her when the soap-dish
struck his cheek. A little fury with wild eyes
and set lips stood in the doorway, and all round
her, just as she’d taken them from the lift, lay
implements of war. With remarkable force she
let the nigger have the wash-hand basin. The jug
she reserved for the chorus girl. Her aim was
deadly, and the chorus girl was bleeding in three
places. The nigger, with teeth gleaming whitely,
crouched in the fireplace. A razor struck him on
the eyebrow, and a hair-brush on the ear. A vase
with raised roses on it kept the chorus girl think-
ing, and as she lifted her head with a howl of
pain and terror a solid trinket box met her in the
teeth. It was the water-bottle, however, that
laid open her forehead and blackened her eye, and
a long thin tumbler that finished the nigger.
The thing was all over in a minute. Mrs.
Ranji had not uttered a sound. The chorus girl,
blinded with blood, fled screaming to her room.
When it was dark she left, and it was noticed that
she did not appear in the front row, as promised, on
the opening night of the panto. The pallid nigger
snatched at his hat, and disappeared down the
stairs. Mrs. Ranji, always a favorite with the
servants, gave the housemaid half-a-sovereign to
clean up the mess, and the girl said she would
gladly have done it for nothing. Then, seeking
out the proprietress, she paid promptly, and with
great satisfaction, for the breakages. It was a
whole week before Mrs. Ranji’s nigger returned,
and then his linen was unusually soiled, and his
navy serge suit somewhat dusty. Mrs. Ranji
ordered him a hot bath, and that night they
entered the dining-room together, as had been
their wont before the interruption. And the
happy light was in Mrs. Ranji’s eyes again—she
blushed gently when the nigger passed the mar-
malade.

Made in Patmos.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I DIED and went to Heaven ;
They led me up and down,
They showed me many planets,
They offered me a crown.
‘‘Look ! ” said Saint Peter. “See that crystal
dome.”
I gazed at the far smear of earth and whispered
“Home.”
“ The earth,” said he, “ was cruel
When I drew mortal breath ;
The world for me a prison
That opened but to death !
Contentment here have we without alloy,
No hates have we, no strife, no anguish and no
joy.”
“The world,” said I, “is better
For men like you and me;
No bitter gyve nor coffle—
Your life was slavery.” ....
“ See,” said he, “ all our towers of amethyst ”
(I gazed to where the earth was cymared by the
mist).
The metal paradise
Did weary me;
The gold, the glow, the glass,
The useless sea;
Queer beasts by altars speaking empty words,
And many organs bleating three eternal chords.
Flowers that revolved,
And showmen’s tricks;
A heavy incensed air,
Brass candlesticks;
A blare of trumpets blown, and nothing done—•
Nothing but empty sound and glare of Arctic sun.
I pitied Him !
The Lord of All.
Praise monotoned
Must surely pall—
Laudation nauseate the Force Who sees
All things; for God has many manly qualities.
Ay, made by man,
As man by Him,
Truer than gospel—
And less dim.
For, for man’s image God His own hath lent,
And flattered, grateful man returned the compli-
ment.
“ Contentment,” Peter said,
“ Be you content, and rest
On the smooth marble bed,
In the sight of all the blest,
What have you lost with life that grieves you so?”
I answered, gazing at the dear lost sphere below.
“Life, the hawk-gentle, proved a haggard vain,
And I, the falconer, failed to lure her feet,
Unto the jesses ; from the biting rain
Lured her no more by whistling nor with meat.
“I left the dear and most familiar world—
The clasping hands, the eyes that shone for me—
And, through the clouds that ceaselessly unfurled
Made landfall by the glaring Jasper Sea.
“ Wandering amid a deafening war of hymns—
Music not such as in my dear world rolls;
Pictures with naught of warmth in him that
limns,
Capon content of smug and sexless souls.
“ Calm, as of full-fed deans in minster close;
Calm, such as comes to maniacs a boon ;
Unholy calm, not such the cypress knows,
Dreaming beneath a full and windless moon.
“ This is a huckster’s heaven—a Paradise—
Of jewellers, pawnbrokers, and all their kin ;
On gold that hath no value how their eyes
Do gaze, repeating their anaemic sin.
“ Show me not emerald rainbows, walls of sard,
For I have known earth’s beauteous plains and
sea,
Give me not crude perfumes, nor cloying nard,
The great grey ranges told their tales to me.
“Staring crowned angels slowly pass me by;
I like me not their walking up and down
(The girl with whom I lived deliciously—
My throne was in her eyes—my love her crown).
“ This loud Trisugion is music fit
For saints whose hearts no earthly memories
swell;
My worldly wayward fancies search, and flit
Unto the wind—the deserts’ canticle.
“Not this eternal incense nor this art—
This everlasting swell of organ laud—
Greater than these to make the soul to start,
The meanest flower by earth’s meanest ford.
“ All these from sensuous essences must fail
To reconcile the exile from below.
Oh ! for the fragrance of the meadow gale,
That doth o’er Tuscan fields in May months blow.
“ Content I’d be were it eternal dawn
Of love, and work, and wine, and griefs that be ;
If it were spring upon a lilied lawn,
Between the Arno and Fiesole.
“ A brown and yellow house upon a hill
Hath more of joy than this —if more of rue—
Earth’s Fighting ! Effort! Winning ! that do fill
The flesh that tells to flesh the message new.
“ Such rainbows as the emerald I disown,
Nor all these vulgar tricks of gold and sard ;
I like not elders sitting round a throne—
Two dozen elders drugged with altar nard.
“The golden candlesticks I’d fain escape—
Their over decoration overfine —
I like me more the great Renaissance shape,
The labor of the lawless Florentine.
“I like me not this House of Lords divine—
One hundred and forty-four thousand sealed ;
Elected not by any vote of mine—
Nor to their posts appointed—but revealed.
SUFFICIENT.
ROBSON : “ What's your unlucky day, Rickly? ” RICKBY : “ I was married on a Friday .”
“All that which made Heaven human is no more!
White Horse of Conquest and Red Horse of
power—
Black Horse of Justice —who Earth’s scourges
bore,
Gladly we took the scourges as our dower.
“You forced on us the grisly steed of Death !
Take ye him back—ye know not joy not birth —
Take ye him who draw no thankful breath—-
Take back the pallid horse from happy earth.
“Give me again a tree pressed hard by clover,
The sun on high and gilding all the land,
A dappled cloud, for contrast, drifting over—
A girl to go with me sweet hand in hand.
“Give even all the sorrow of earth’s bosom—
So it be part of life’s sad joyous ring ;
Let me but hear again through aisles of blossom,
The trumpets of the ever youthful spring.
“Give me the ignorance of the desert wild—
Here is all knowledge ! Valueless it seems !
The million foolish questions of the child,
That are the echoes of youth’s endless dreams,
“Are far more wise than all this wisdom cold—
This knowledge that can never be applied.
The timid here are as the over-bold—
The slave who lived is as the god who died.
“ No gracious darkness, but of light too much—
No warm white arms, nor dewy lips that press !
No bosom that by the swift speech of touch
Alone may break the lover’s silentness.
“ Give me but life again, and nothing after,
Nor onyx walls, nor city gates empearled,
Give me but life and effort—love and laughter—
For one quick moment of the splendid world.”

“I knew not,” Peter said,
“The world was as you say,
My gaze was fixed ahead
Upon the Narrow Way,
But if it’s as you say, I’d like to be,
With you a space below the Jasper Sea !
“ A moment wait for me,
And I will go;
For half a year I’m free
As Judas on his floe.”

He girt his robe, and put away his crown;
And on the earthward clouds we meteored down.

RANDOLPH BEDFORD.
Epinodas and the Satyrs.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
It is only the mass, i.e., the external, that changes.
The human atom is as imperishable as the scientific atom
And is identical throughout the ages.
EPINODAS seated himself on one of the
plinths of the Theseum, and spread his
brown legs before him in the sunlight that
the girls passing from the well might see their
massiveness, and admire. He had spent some of
his earnings in Macedonia on a new sky-blue
tunic and kilt, and a pair of the most ornate
sandals of brown leather and brass that money
could buy. He watched the passing girls with
the hungry look of the man who has passed many
months without female society, and exchanged
comments with the Boeotian soldier who stood
by his side. A man, browned even as himself,
and naked save for his kilt, and bearing a bale on
his back, came round the steps of the Acropolis.
He said something to a girl at the corner of the
Theseum. Epinodas did not catch the remark,
but he saw the girl laugh and throw up her head
with a flutter of curls, and strut off with a swagger
of her hips, saying :
“ I’m sure ! ”
Epinodas stared hard at the man with the
bundle as he drew closer. He was about to
pass on.
“What 0, Nik!” he remarked, quietly.
“ Where to ?”
The man turned, gazed at Epinodas, threw his
burden to the marble steps, and said in Greek :
“ Well, I’m damned ! ” He advanced to Epinodas
and grasped his hand. “ Where did you spring
from, Eppy ? And who’d ha’ thought o’ seein’ you
in those togs.”
Epinodas laughed. “Just landed at the
Piraeus last night, and thought I might as well
get into something decent, and we got a fair cut
out of the profits.”
“How did you like being eight months away
from the girls ? ” inquired Nikias, with a wink at
Plutoios, the soldier. “Is there any up there ? ”
“ Not when you get out-back, where the timber-
getting is. But there’s nymphs—stacks of ’em.”
“ Nymphs ! ” said Nikias. He was interested.
I never saw a nymph. They say there’s nymphs
knocking about the banks of the Illysus of a
night, but I’ve been thereat all times, and haven’t
seen one yet. I reckon it’s a tale.”
“Those’d be naiads,” explained Epinodas, with
a careful regard for accuracy. “ The ones we
run across were dryads. Very fine they were,
too, some of ’em.”
“Was there many?” asked the wondering
soldier.
“Many!” said Epinodas. “Whips o’ ’em.
We was frightened to fell the trees until we’d
gone round and chased ’em away.”
“ And were they friendly to you ? ”
Epinodas smiled. “ Friendly! ”he said, scorn-
fully. “By Zeus ! just listen to him.”
“What are these here nymphs like, anyhow ?”
asked the soldier, brusquely.. He felt rather
nettled at Epinodas’ contempt for his ignorance
on the subject.
I hey re just girls served up with cayenne
pepper, that’s what they are.”
And what do they look like ; are they nice?”
“I should just say they were. They’re all
young, about seventeen or eighteen I should
reckon, and they’re as lively as grasshoppers.
You’d think they were women at first, only
they’re more frisky, and don’t do no work, only
dance and sing when there’s anybody else about.”
“And when there isn’t? asked the soldier
eagerly.
“Now you’re askin’ questions,” remarked
Epinodas, with a wise air.
“What do they live on, if they don’t work?”
asked Nikias.
Epinodas hesitated for a moment. Then he saw
anavenueof escape. “Hanged if I know,” he said.
“ I never seen ’em eat. They’ll drink wine with
the best of ’em, though. I had got hold of a little
dark one. You remember that piece that used to
be in old Dionysius’ wine shop ? ” They nodded.
“ Something after the cut of ’er, only better look-
ing. I used to call her Naxia, because she talked
a sorter broken Greek, like the fellows from
Naxos.”
“Can nymphs talk?” inquired the soldier,
open-eyed.
“ Talk ! Talk your blessed head off if you give
’em a show.”
“ And did you stick to her all the time ? ” asked
Nikias.
“All the time? There was five of us, and
about three hundred dryads chasing round the
camp. What do you think ?”
“Then,” burst Nikias and the soldier simul-
taneously, like two variety artists in a duet,
“ what in Hades made you come back ? ”
Epinodas looked puzzled. He coughed, then
he said: “Well, you see, it’s this way.” He
paused again. “It was like this: A chap likes
having a girl to himself, and these here nymphs,
they’re all right in their way, but you can’t trust
them behind the trunk of the nearest tree.”
The others seemed unsatisfied.
His face lit up with a further thought. “ And,
besides, the satyrs was dropping to the game.”
“ What are satyrs like ? ”
You know,’ said Epinodas, “ big hairy blokes
like Persians, with goats’ legs. You’ve seen the
picture of ’em, if you never ran across them.”
“But, I mean, what are they like to deal with ? ”
“They’re fair cows, I tell you,” said Epinodas.
“ They’ll eat you if they get you alone.”
I don t believe there’s no such things as
satyrs,” said the soldier.
You don’t,’ echoed Epinodas, “now don’t
you ? If you had their blessed hoofs kicking your
stomach out you’d believe in ’em quick and lively.”
The sceptic was silenced.
“ Did you have any fights with them ?” asked
Nikias.
“Dozens of ’em,” replied Epinodas, “towards
the end. When they tumbled to us and the
nymphs, we couldn’t fall a tree without a couple
of us standing off with a quiver full of arrows.
Then, at night, they used to get round us in the
scrub and bark like dogs. One thine - , though,
they’ll never come near if you have a fire
. burning. If it wasn’t for that we’d have been
outed over and over again.”
“ Did you ever kill one ? ” asked the soldier.
“Four or five altogether, I forget which now.
One night, just as I kissed good-bye to'Naxia, I
was poling along to the camp when I heard some-
thing galloping behind me. I thought it was my
horse got loose from the hobbles, and I looked
round to find a big bloke of a satyr coming
at me Hades-for-leather. It was no use try-
ing to run from them; they’re as fast as a
horse or a nymph—and all I had was my knife.
My hope was to fight. If they get their
hands on you you’re done, for they’re as strong as
elephants ; but they can’t use their fists a little
bit. I just stood up, and when he got within my
reach, I let him have my left fair on the mark.
It winded him, I tell you, but he closed with
me, and got a hold of my neck that no fellow on
earth could get out of.”
“Show us,” said the soldier.
“Not much,” retorted Epinodas. “I’m going
to keep that to myself, and if you chaps want to
pick up a bit of money at the next Olympian, just
you back me for the middleweight wrestling cham-
pionship. Well, as I was saying, he closed on me,
and I knew he’d kick me to bits unless I was
quick. I dropped on my knees, and as he shoved
my arm down, I managed to get out my knife.
He gathered himself up to start kicking, and I
just reached round and carved his heart out.
They’re cows, I tell you. If the Ephors knew
their business they’d give a reward for their
scalps.”
The soldier felt it was time for him to say some-
thing.
“ When I was away with the 10,000,” he began,
“ I had a bit of a scrap with a centaur. I was on
outpost duty, and he came browsing up the side
of the hill ”
“Go on,” scorned Epinodas, “centaurs don’t
browse. They eat meat same as me and you.”
The soldier winced. The interruption broke
the thread of his story. He had forgotten what
he intended to say. “ This one did, anyhow,” he
protested mildly, and then relapsed into silence.
“And these here nymphs, were they all un-
married ? ”
“I dunno,” replied Epinodas, “we never
thought of asking.”

PRINCE of impostors, Steak-and-Kidney
Pie,
I cannot look on thee without a groan.
Many strange dishes have I met since I
Upon the care of hirelings first was thrown;
Thou art their chief; thou hast, to raise a sigh,
A poignancy peculiarly thine own ;
For in my happy boyhood Pie was still
The acme of my grandam’s culinary skill.
Thy kidney-scraps are few and far between
As angels’ visits (not, of course, as nice);
Thy squares of so-called steak as thin and lean,
As tough and meagre, as a chopped-up slice
Of the despised Cold Roast of yestereen ;
Ay, now I come to think upon it twice,
I must conclude this is the self-same stuff;
No two consecutive bits of beef could be so tough.
Her crust was crust—not doughy mockery,
lit to be flung, as damper, on the coals.
Cut crisply through it, and you might descry
In the rich gravy kidneys swim in shoals
And juicy lumps of steak. Ah ! hers was Pie
that might bring gladness to departed souls
Of diners, if indeed those mortal parts
Could be affected yet that underlay their hearts.
I am no craven ; I have faced ere now
I he sodden dumpling and hot, buttered bun,
And curries, stews, and hashes that would bow
To no promiscuousness beneath the sun;
They touched the stomach, not the heart; but
Thou,
Impostor Pie, thou hast me all fordone;
Thou mak’st me feel as if I really must
Go shed fresh, bitter tears above my grandam’s
N.s.w.
CHARLES MACLEAN.

Making a Rise.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
MAT CONYERS, Murty Brown, and
Jim, who was nicknamed Webster, had
been idling about Grafton for a couple
of months. Conyers was waiting for Scully, who
was coming down from the Logan to take up a
fencing contract at Caramana, and Murty and Jim
had harvesting prospects in. view at the same
place. Meanwhile their hard-earned savings
were trickling out and nothing coming in, a state
of affairs that worried Conyers.
He turned over many schemes in his mind, and
one morning he came into camp simmering with
excitement.
“ I’ve just struck it ! ” he announced, dropping
on to the bunk. “A dead certainty, an’ ’s easy
as flippin’ yer finger.”
“What’s her name?” asked Murty, who was
sewing on buttons. _
“It’s business,” said Conyers. With a
little smartness, we ken make £lO a day. Easy.
“Shugh!” said Murty, taking up his work
again. “Yer woolgatherin’.”
“ Ten pound a day an’ no risks !” Conyers re-
peated.
“ Kindly elucidate, Mr. Conyers,” said Jim.
Conyers lit a cigarette.
“ I met a chap in town, this mornin’, as wants
horses,” be began. “His name’s Phineas Jones.
Buyin’ for Japan or India, or somewhere. Any-
how, money’s no object to him, seein’ as he’s will-
in’ to part up twenty quid a head for good, up-
standin’ hacks. I got into conversation with him,
an’, when he asked me if I had any to sell, I told
him I was expectin’ a few down shortly from my
estate ”
“ What d’yer call it ? ” asked Murty.
“ Meanwhile,” Conyers continued, ignoring the
question, “ I had three nags at the camp that I
could sell him for £l5 a head. He’ll be out this
afternoon to look at them.”
“ I don’t quite comprehend,” said Jim.
“Where are the quadrupeds ? ”
“ I’ve got one that I don’t want,” said Conyers.
“ Quain, over here, has another, an’ McFogg, the
farmer across th’ road there, has th’ third. We’ll
get them two first of all, an’ if we succeed in
sellin’ ’em to Phineas Jones, then we’ll lose no
time in buyin’ ’em off Quain an’ McFogg.
“ Horse-stealin’!” cried Murty. “By cripes,
if you’re goin’ at that, Mat Conyers, the sooner
yer disconnect with this company the better.”
“My dear fellow,” said Conyers, loftily, “if
you would only keep that simian face shut
up, you might be mistaken at times for a
man of ord’nary intellect. There’s nothing
crooked about this business. It’s a straightfor-
ward, honest deal.”
“You mean, then,” said Murty, “you’ll buy
the ’orses off Quain an’ McFogg, an’ then sell ’em
to Phineas in tli’ yooshal manner?”
“No, I don’t. We’ll sell them first an’ buy
them afterwards. That’s where the beauty of it
comes in. There’s no risk of losin’, an’ you know
what you’re makin’ when you’re buyin’.”
“If that’s what yer call an honest deal, then
I’m a darned rogue,” Murty declared.
“Well, your looks don’t belie it, anyway,”
Conyers retorted. “’S a wonder to me how you
escape arrest like you do.”
“Don’t haggle, Conyers,” Jim interrupted.
“Introduce a little more luminosity into your re-
marks.”
“The idea is this,” said Conyers ; “ I’ll go an’
’ave a talk with Quain while you’re roundin’ up
our neddies —fetch up what’s runnin’ with them
too, as a mob makes a good impression ; an’ Murty
will whip over an’ interview McFogg.”
“Ho ! Will he?” cried Murty, mutinously.
“ You’ll put on your best clothes, Brown,”
Conyers resumed. “You can ’ave th’ loan o’ my
chain to give you a well-to-do appearance ”
“That darned brass thing with no watch on
it ? ” Murty protested.
“There’s a hobble-ring on one of my straps;
that ’ll keep th’ chain from slippin’ out of y’r
pocket, an’ nobody ’ll know but ’tain’t a watch.
You’ll go to him as a buyer. You ’eard he had a
chestnut ’orse to -seR When he trots him out,
you look in his mouth as though you knew all
about ’orses’ teeth, feel his fetlocks, look him
round, an’ try an’ beat down the price. You ask
what lie’s by ; if he’s staunch, and if he has any
vices. You was took down with a vicious brute
once, ses you. Inquire if he’s easy to ketch, an’
if he bucks. Finally, you say you are pleased
with the look of the beast, an’ his references are
satisfactory, but you’d like to try him. You want
him specially as a town hack, an’ would like to
ride him down Prince-street. If he shapes Al,
you’ll be over with the money before sundown.
That’s all straight sailin’, isn’t it ? Jim’s a bit of
a bush lawyer ; ask him if there’s anything illegal
in that transaction.”
“Providing you don’t covenant with Mr.
McFogg in any way that would be binding,” pro-
nounced Jim, “there would be no infringement
of the law.”
“Well, that’s delightfully obscure, anyway,”
said Murty. “ But, mind you, if any hitch do
occur, you’ve got to be attorney for the com-
, pany.”
Mr. Brown having acquired the necessary well-
to-do appearance, the three set out on their re-
spective errands. In an hour they were back
again, all with horses.
‘‘Ah ! ” said Conyers, beaming. ‘ ‘ All a man
wants in this country is brains and a little push.
What’s the price, Murty?”
“Ten quid,” Murty answered. “If ’twarn’t
for this hobble-ring watch I’m wearin’ I might
’ave got him for less. Gunbust me if old McFogg’s
clock ’ain’t stopped when I got there, an’ seein’
me sportin’ th’ jew’l’ry, he reckoned ’twas a good
time to set her jiggin’ again. ‘ It’s mighty unfor-
tunit,’ I sez, ‘ but mine’s stopped too. Forgot to
wind her up last night.’ He looked at me ’s if
he expected me to haul it out. People mostly do
show th’ ticker. It got me fair flummoxed.
Daren’t stoop even to feel th’ prad’s fetlocks for
fear th’ darned thing ud drop out o’ me pocket;
an’ ’ad to be rude to th’ youngster when it
wanted to climb on me knee. Next time I wear
a chain, there’ll be something on the end of it
that ken put McFogg’s clock right, I’ll bet. Here
you are, Matthew ; put it away careful.”
Phineas Jones turned up at the appointed time.
He inspected the horses, bought them, paid for
them, and took them away. Conyers was jubi-
lant. He almost ran to the bank to cash the
cheque, and bustled himself out of breath getting
back again.
“That’s the way to do business,” he said, pro-
ducing a bundle of crisp notes. “We’ll simply
coin money at this game. There’s thousands in it.
By-an’-bye we’ll be able to buy in mobs, an’ pay
cash on the nail. We might corner horses, in
fact, an’ become millionaires. You laugh, but
there’s plenty o’ things more impossible than
that. Here’s your tenner, Murty. Go an’ pay
McFogg, an’ I’ll skip over an’ settle with Quain.
You might cook something for tea, Jim—some-
thing extra appetising—while we’re gone.”
Murty found McFogg at the pigsty, chopping
up pumpkins.
“ Where’s tli’ ’orse ? ” he asked.
“ Hobbled him at the camp,” said Murty. “He
suits.”
“Suits, does he?” McFogg repeated, slowly
and moodily tossing pieces of pumpkin over to the
porkers. “ Wal, I don’t think I’ll sell. I’ve
changed me mind.”
A TERRIBLE SITUATION.
“Get it up , Mac. Get it up, and you’ll feel better.” “Man, ye dinna ken—it's whusky!”
“Changed—yer—mind !” gasped Murty, turn-
ing pale.
McFogg put his broad back against the chock -
and-log wall, and his arms on top of it. “ Ander-
son was over from th’ next farm,” he began, “ an’
he tells me I ken get a lot more for that ’orse from
a buyer in town be th’ name o’ Jones. Anderson
traded him one that ain’t worth shucks agin mine
for fourteen lovely sov’reigns. He’ll be along this
way in th’ mornin’.”
“ I wouldn’t’ave any truck with him if I was
you,” said Murty, swallowing the dryness in his
throat. “ I hear he ain’t no account.”
“ Don’t matter so long’s his money’s orlright.”
“That’s just where it is,” Murty chipped in.
“ I ’ave it on good authority that his cheques ain’t
to be relied on. He’s some sort o’ crook. Whether -
or-no, Mr. McFogg, you sold th’ beast to me, an’
I've come to pay th’ tenner.”
“He ain’t sold yet, an’ he ain’t goin’ to be sold
for that,” McFogg answered.
“ If I’d knowed you was that sort of man ”
said Murty.
“What sort of man?” McFogg demanded,
loudly.
“Why,” said Murty, abashed, “I—l thought
when you said you’d do a thing—why, of course,
you’d do it.”
“I offered to sell at a price to-day,” McFogg
returned, “ but since then the market’s improved.
You should ’ave closed at th’ time. As it is, I
want th’ ’orse returned to-night.”
“But—he—he can’t be returned.” Murty was
in a blue funk, and breathed like a man who was
suffering from enlargement of the liver.
“ Why not ? ” McFogg demanded.
“ He ain’t as well as he used to be.”
“ What’s th’ matter with him ? ”
“ He’s dead ! ”
McFogg sprang away from the pigsty.
“ Dead !” he cried. “ What did he die of ?”
“It was this way,” Murty explained. “We
took him over Dobie-street punt to see how he’d
shape, an’ jogs down Swan Creek Road. Cornin’
back, we goes for a bit of a spin, but we ain’t
gone far ’fore he turns a turtle an’ dislocates his
blamed neck. He warn’t reliable, that ’orse.
I’m sufferin’ all over from th’ buster yet. ’S a
wonder I warn’t killed. But I’ve come to pay for
him ”
“You’ll pay £25 then,” McFogg declared.
Murty staggered, and for a moment he blinked
at the big farmer in painful silence. “Why,” he
said, finally, “he warn’t worth half that when he
was alive.”
“I value that hoss at £25,” McFogg repeated,
doggedly.
“ By cripes, that’s a bit pure ! ” gasped Murty.
“ It’s pre—posterous ! ”
“Are ye goin’ to pay me?” McFogg asked.
“ If ye’re not, I promise y’r, me man, I’ll make it
warm for y’r afore I’m done with y’r.”
Murty hadn’t the least doubt that he could do
that. “I’ll go and see me mates,” he said, edging
away. “We wur partners in th’ animal.”
He hurried off in a state of nervousness bor-
dering on collapse. To the camp was only a few
minutes’ walk, but Murty’s dull perceptions were
unusually active during the interval. Conyers
was sweetening the tea with a pannikin, and
talking of silver teapots when he arrived.
Murty’s distress was so eloquent that Conyers’
radiant smiles vanished at first sight of him.
“By cripes, we’re in a nice mess now,” he
burst out, glaring wildly around him. “ Where’s
that blamed Attorney-General ?”
“ What’s up ? ” asked Conyers.
“ McFogg won’t sell! ”
Conyers turned pale. “My Gawd !” he said,
hoarsely. “What sort of a bungling blamed
fool’s deal did you make with him ? Dynamite
your idiotic eyes!” he yelled; “didn’t you
follow my instructions ? ”
“ I did,” Murty yelled back at him. “ But yer
didn’t instruct me that McFogg was an un-
principled swine-breeder, an’ warn’t to be relied
on. He’s a cow of a feller.”
“ What’s interrupted the negotiations ? ” asked
Jim, coming out of the tent.
Murty detailed the circumstances in figurative
language, and gave several descriptions of an
agriculturist who represented the two extremities
of an ass.
“It’s not a delectable situation, I’ll allow,”
said Jim. “ But don’t get excited. Though Mr.
McFogg can claim continuity of ownership, and
though you violated the laws of your country in
disposing of the quadruped before you had
acquired him by the orthodox process, I adduce
from the evidence that there were no criminal
intentions, and with a little diplomacy ”
“ An’ plenty o’ that sort o’ flapdoodle,” Murty
broke in, viciously.
“ I presume we can circumvent the corybantic
extortionist,” Jim concluded. “ Affix my saddle
to the most adjacent hack, Mr. Brown, while I
get ready to confabulate with him.”
Murty executed the order with the hurry and
fuss of a sycophantic groom. He wanted a free
mind to go to bed with.
It was sundown when Jim left the camp on a
black colt, and ere dusk had given place to night
the two distressed stock dealers were surprised by
a visit from Mr. McFogg. Murty asked him, in
a low voice, to have a pint of tea ; but the big
man intimated that he had left his own tea wait-
ing at home.
“ I’ve been thinkin’,” he said, hitching up the
legs of his trousers and squatting on one heel
“Eh ?” said Murty, with feverish expectancy.
“ I’ve been thinkin’ over that affair,” McFogg
repeated, “an’ seein’ as litigation’s expensive, an’
means worry an’ loss o’ time, I’ve decided to take
th’ tenner.”
Murty rushed him with it, also with paper, pen
and ink for the receipt.
“You wouldn’t ’ave done any better with
Phineas Jones, anyway,” Conyers remarked when
the document was in safe custody.
“No-o,” McFogg droned gloomily. “I was
talkin’ to Phineas Jones awhile ago. He’s a man
wot’s ’ad a lot of experience in dealin’s, an’ knows
a heap about law. He pinted out, when I told
him how we stood, that I was renderin’ myself
liable to prosecution for breach of contract, as a
verbal agreement is bindin’ in ’orse dealin’, sheep-
shearin’, an’ marriage. ’N’ as for himself, he
wouldn’t ’ave anything to do with a hanimal that
was liable to get tangled up in a lawsuit. Sed my
simplicity, an’ other hifalutin’ things I couldn’t
keep track of, filled him to the utmost capacity
of his astonishment. ”
“ Was heridin’ a black colt?” asked Murty.
“ He was.”
“Ah!” said Murty, winking at Conyers.
“ That was him we saw goin’ to your place.”
Jim dropped in just then. Murty and Conyers
shook hands with him as though they hadn’t seen
him for 12 months, and called him Mr. Jones.
But next morning the real Phineas Jones called
on his way to McFogg’s farm, and he was riding
the horse that was supposed to be dead.
As soon as he had left them, the three con-
spirators packed up hurriedly and lit out at a hard
run for Caramana.

“Child,” she said, “’tis the grey owl’s shout—
Come, shut the world and its shadows out;
Sure, ye know, that I’ve you alone—
Night and the Forest keep their own.”
Little Monica heeded not—
Stole away from her mother’s cot,
Down the track where the moon-buds blow ;
Wind to wind was muttering low,
Pine was whispering unto pine,
As she passed in the clean moonshine,
Through the shadows that swayed to meet,
Clasp and cover her dancing feet.
Moon-men spinning as spiders spin
Webs of light that she wandered in,
Drew her curls through their fingers white,
Deftly weaving them close with light,
That none might know in the moonshine there
Which was shimmer and which was hair.
Little Monica said, “I pray
Unbind me, for I may not stay.
Mother waits with a silver comb
(Dim the forest, and far to home !)
To braid my locks for holy day.”
The moon men gloating as demons gloat,
Pressed pale hands to her milky throat;
Quivering feelers cold and bare
Bore her up through the quiet air.
Like a kite that is torn away
From a child on a stormy day,
On she flew on a seaward wind,
Leaving earth and its lights behind.
Lascars reefing a loosened sail,
Thought her voice was a coming gale ;
And a fluttering albatross,
Floating high on the breeze a-toss,
Wondered long what the thing might be,
Whimpering like a child at sea !
Stars a-whirl in the rushing sky
Touched her as she passed them by ;
Stared, amazed at her reeling flight,
Soaring dizzily through the night—
Little Monica lies a-svvoon
In the webs of the big white Moon !
Night by night when the suns go out,
Little Monica flits about.
Only the children see, men say,
Her small, bare feet in the Milky Way,
Dancing down where the old gods stand ;
When the Moon is a golden rim
Saturn takes her by the hand,
Wandering o’er the skies with him ;
When the Moon is a golden shield
Still she sits on the lunar field,
Now, as once by her mother’s door,
Counts the stars on the Solar Floor ;
Recking not in her childish mirth
One is the light of the good, green Earth.
Night by night where the moonshine flits
Sadly Monica’s mother sits ;
Neighbors come with a friendly moan :
“ Sure, ’tis sad for ye a” alone !
Watchin’ here in the darksome door,
Moonshine stealin’ across the floor —
Warm ye’d be in your cosy bed ”
“ Whist ye,” Monica’s mother said,
“Those white, quiverin’, creepin’ rays
Make me think o’ Monica’s ways ;
Make me dream o’ Monica’s hair,
Pale an’ flaxen, a-shinin’ there;
An’ some night when the large moon lies
Like a flower in the fadin’ skies,
Haply Monica ’ll come to me—.
Lave the stars for her mother’s eyes ;
Nestlin’ close like she used to be,
Warm cheek lyin’ against my knee.”
Neighbors making a friendly moan
Pass where Monica’s mother sits,
Saying, “ Lave me, the crature lone!
Combin’ out wid a silver comb
Moonshine gleamin’ in golden bits —
Vainly callin’ her moon-child home.”

The Wet-Nurse at Watson’s
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE finger of Nicholas Hobbs paused
half-way down the “ Situations Vacant ”
column on the board outside the news-
paper office, and his dull-colored eyes rested
affectionately on the advertisement as he slowly
spelt it out—
WANTED, a kind, elderly, sober man, fond of
children, to take small boy for vvalks. Apply,
Mrs. Watson, “ Dulce Domum,” Wellington Road.
“Talcin’ it on, mate?” queried a bystander
who, in his eager search for work, had evidently
omitted to shave and wash for a considerable
period.
Nicholas Hobbs stroked his long, grey beard
reflectively. “ Well, I dunno,” he said. “’Tis a
queersome sort of a job, ain’t it? But then again
it ain’t ’ard work to take a small boy out walkin
—yer needn’t go no further’n the nearest publick
park ”
“’Ouse,” corrected the bystander, with a grin.
Nicholas Hobbs drew himself up with a grave,
haughty air. “I ain’t one o’ them sort,” he said
grandly; “ I never touches a drop o’ anythink.”
The unshaven individual looked Nicholas up
and down with an unbelieving air.
“Will you ’ave a taste?” he said presently,
jerking his thumb in the direction of the public-
house opposite, with the air of a man determined
to put his opinion to the test.
“ Yes, I will! ” replied Nicholas with decision.
“Yer might say ‘ Thanks ! ’ when a gentleman
arsts yer to ’ave a drink with ’im,” retorted the
unshaven individual indignantly, as he ruefully
fumbled with a sixpence in his trousers pocket.
“It’s all yer own fault,’’ replied Nicholas
warmly. “You says ‘Will yer?’ and I says
‘ Yes, I will,’ and there’s an end of it. But yer
needn’t be frightened,” he went on scathingly,
“I’ll shout arterwards.”
“All right, mate,” answered the unshaven one,
with a mollified air ; “no offence, I ’ope. Take
this,” he added with an air of great friendliness.
“ It might come in ’andy.”
“ Thanks,” replied Nicholas, attaching a large
piece of blue ribbon to his coat, as they passed
through the swinging doors.
“ Two long beers,” said the unshaven one, fling-
ing down his coin with a “ devil-take-the-six-
pence ” air.
The landlord filled up one glass and handed it
to him, and then, with the empty glass poised in
the air, glanced with a grin at the blue ribbon on
the coat of Nicholas Hobbs.
“We don’t keep hop beer,” he said, facetiously.
“Everybody knows that,” retorted Nicholas,
briskly. “If all the beer was like yours, the
men pickin’ ’ops’d be out of a job.”
“Would they !” answered the landlord, indig-
nantly, as he handed over the glass, not liking
the laugh raised at his expense. “ P’raps,” he
added, scathingly, “if they couldn’t find a job
’op-pickin’, they’d take on the job you’ve just left.”
“Ho ! ” said Nicholas, genially, “ and wot was
that?”
“Pickin’ oakum,” replied the landlord, with a
grin.
“ Was it! ” retorted Nicholas, angrily. “ Well,
even if it was, it was better than pickin’ pockets,
for that’s wot the man’s doin’ as sells beer like
yours.”
“Just you be careful, my man,” said the land-
lord, furiously.
“Trust me,” replied Nicholas, fervently, as he
raised his glass. “ I’m goin’ straight to the ’orse-
pittle as soon as I’ve drunk it.”
“Ho! ho!” cackled the unshaven one, while
the publican turned blue with rage.
“Fill’em up,” said Nicholas, pushing across
the empty glasses.
“ I’ll do nothin’ of the sort,” retorted the land-
lord.
“Fill up the glasses when the gentleman tells
yer,” commanded the unshaven one in a stern,
anxious tone. “ It’s ’is shout.”
“I’ll not serve you,” repeated the landlord,
with decision. “ Better go and see ’im safely to
the ’orsepittle, ” he added, grimly.
“Some one’ll ’ave to see you safely there if I
get hold of yer,” retorted the unshaven one,
excitedly, as he leaned over the bar and shook his
fist in the landlord’s face. “ I’ll tell the brewery
wot own’s yer, that yer spilin’ the trade. I’ll”
“Put ’em out, George,” interjected the land-
lord, nodding to a brawny assistant who was
rolling up his sleeves.
At this point Nicholas Hobbs promptly melted
away, but the unshaven one was extremely angry,
and before the “ putting out” was an accomplished
fact, it called for the assistance of a policeman,
who in turn took such a violent fancy to the un-
shaven one that he called a cab and carried him
off in triumph.
Next morning his Worship listened with a
grave, stern face to an account of a struggle, in
which a torn uniform and much broken glass were
mingled.
“What have you to say ?” asked his Worship,
gravely.
“ ’Twarn’t my row at all, yer Washup,” pleaded
the unshaven one. “I was clean diddled into
it ”
“What?” queried his Worship with an un-
believing air.
“ Clean diddled into it, yer Washup, by an old
barracooter with a long, grey beard ”
“Seven daysl” interrupted his Worship,
sternly. , . *
* * *
Meanwhile Nicholas Hobbs, having witnessed
from a safe distance the departure of the cab with
its contents of whirling arms and legs, made his
way to “Dulce Domum,” Wellington-road, chew-
ing a peppermint and chuckling as he went. He
had the blue ribbon still displayed in his coat.
He answered all questions satisfactorily, and pro-
duced certain bogus testimonials of a richly
glowing character. On the strength of them he
was installed as a species of male nurse to Master
Willie, and had the prospect of being a general
rouseabout between times. The remuneration
was 10s. a week with an attic, and board in the
kitchen.
At 10 o’clock next morning, after a long recital
by Mrs. Watson of the lapses of the female nurses
who had preceded him, he started out, accom-
panied by Little Willie, for a morning constitu-
tional.
“ You are not to linger talking with policemen,
Nicholas,” called out Mrs. Watson, warningly,
from the verandah.
“ No, mum, most certainly not. I carn’t bear
’em,” answered Nicholas, whose one fervent wish,
for sundry private reasons of his own, was that
policemen might not linger talking to him.
Just as they neared the entrance to the park
they passed a public-house, the cellar door of
which was open, and a cool draught issued into
the hot atmosphere.
“ Wot a delicious smell! ” observed Nicholas,
sniffing the air.
“ It’s beer,” said Little Willie. “ Father hates
beer,” he added, after a pause.
“’E must ’ave opened a flat bottle,” observed
Nicholas, with conviction.
“Father says if he was King he’d pour all the
beer in the world into the gutter,” went on Little
Willie. '
Nicholas glanced with a parched throat at the
dry, bluestone gutter, which reflected back the
glaring heat of the sun, and a vision of that gutter
swimming with beer, while he sat on the kerbstone
with a glass, rose before his mind.
“I wish they’d crown ’im,” he observed with
feeling. “This very day,” he added fervently, as
they passed into a little bit of frowsy grass that
called itself a park.
Nicholas immediately sought out the nearest
shady tree, and drew a newspaper from his
pocket.
“ Go and play with them little boys,” he said,
indicating a group of ragged urchins who were
playing with paper boats around a pond.
Little Willie glanced at him with an unbeliev-
ing air. “Mamma wouldn’t let me play with
boys,” he said; “ besides, they’re ragged.”
“Just you go an’play with ’em immediate,”
commanded Nicholas, looking up from his paper,
“an’ drop them silly notions at once. Who’s
been a-lookin’ arter your eddication?”
“Father teaches me himself,” replied Little
Willie.
“Well, ’e ain’t ’arf doin’ it proper,” said
Nicholas. “Don’t you know we’re all ekals’ere
in Orsetrailyer ? Ain’t you never been told that
most everybody’s grandpa in Orsetrailyer came
from a prisin, and their grandma from a pub?”
“ No,” replied Little Willie meekly.
“Well, they did,” retorted Nicholas with de-
cision, “and don’t you forgit it. Now, go and
play, and leave your coat behind for me to sit on,
or I’ll be gettin’ grass seeds in me Sunday
trowsis.”
Nicholas perused his paper, and then -dropped
off to sleep, awaking half-an-hour afterwards to
find that the day had grown hotter and his throat
dryer. He had not a coin in his possession, and
seven days must elapse before his wages were due.
Seven days with the thermometer probably in
the region of 100°, in the household of a man who
said beer should be poured in the gutter !
Nicholas
groaned aloud
at the thought.
True, he had
existed for
longer periods
without alco-
holic stimula-
tion, but that
had been in
various seclud-
ed establish-
ments, as a
State guest.
Here, how-
ever, things
were different.
He was free as
air, and all he
wanted was
sixpence to
start with.
Away over
the park pal-
ings in the dis-
tance, his eyes
rested with a
fascinated
glance on the
gold lettering
on the wall of
theWaitawhile
Arms, which
announced
“PURE
ALES ” to all
and sundry.
At length,
with a hope-
less sigh, he
let his eyes
wander, and
they rested
with a start
on the three
gilded balls of
a pawnbroker’s
sign not far
from the pub-
lic-house.
Thence they
journeyed to
Little Willie’s coat, upon which he sat, as if
following his train of thought.
For quite three seconds Nicholas bravely re-
sisted temptation, and then, with Little Willie’s
coat thrown over his arm, he followed in the
direction of his glance.
The pawnbroker spread out the coat upon the
counter. “ Where did you get it ?” he inquired,
looking at Nicholas suspiciously.
Nicholas passed his handkerchief across his
eyes before replying. “It belonged to me pore
little nevvy as was drowned,” he answered.
“But the coat hasn’t been wet,” urged the
pawmbroker unbelievingly.
“’E was fishin’ for crayfish in a water-’ole —
pore little chap,” sobbed Nicholas, “ an’ ’e left ’is
clo’es behind ’im on the bank.”
“ Wot a considerate little chap’e was!” said
the pawnbroker, sympathetically. “Thinkin’ of
’is pore ’ole uncle to the last. ’Ow much do you

What we may become if pony racing and surf
bathing continue to be the national pastimes.
want on it, anyway?” he continued briskly, return-
ing to business.
“ Four shillin’s,” replied Nicholas; “ I wouldn’t
take less.”
“I’ll give you a shilling,” said the pawnbroker,
with great determination.
“ And I’ll take it,” replied Nicholas promptly,
stretching out his hand.
He purchased and finished two bottle? of local
beer, and at mid-day was awakened by his charge.
“ Wake up,” cried Little Willie, tugging at his
coat, “ and come home to lunch.”
“ We’re goin’to stay all day, and I’ve ’ad my
lunch,” replied Nicholas, glancing with a satisfied
air at the empty bottles, a few yards away.
“ But I haven’t had mine” urged Little Willie,
in a tone there was no mistaking.
“That’s only once in a while,” observed
Nicholas, airily. “ Think of them pore little boys
as ’ave to go without their lunch every day.”
“ I don’t want to think of them,” wailed Little
Willie, bursting into tears. “ I want something
to eat.”
“Look at the nice, green grass,” said Nicholas,
craftily, trying to change the subject.
But if the grass was green, Little Willie was
not, and obstinately continued his lamentations.
Nicholas at length gave way.
“ Well, take off your boots and socks and go
and paddle,” he said. “ I’ve got an uncle here
abouts, and I’ll see if he can provide us with some
bread and cheese.”
The boots and socks accordingly journeyed to
keep the coat company, and Nicholas returned
with another bottle, and a cheese sandwich for
Little Willie.
The afternoon wore on, and at four o’clock
Little Willie’s hat, which he had hung up beneath
a willow-tree, went the same journey.
Just as the dusk closed in, a venerable gentle-
man, with a long, gray beard, steered an erratic
course up the Wellington Road, to the amusement
of passers-by. Clasped by the hand, he brought
along with him a coatless, hatless, shoeless little
boy, splashed with mud from head to foot, and
crying bitterly. _ , _ „
As they neared the gate of “Dulce Uomum
an anxious mother, who had been keeping a
watchful look-out, rushed forward with an agoni-
sing shriek, and clasped her dirt-soiled treasure
in her arms. . . . . . ...
At the same moment, a worried-looking lather,
accompanied by a policeman, drove up in a cab.
Nicholas steadied himself against the fence, and
beamed upon the family re-union.
“Had a—hie—mosh pleasansh—hie—walk—
mosh enyoyablish—hie —day. Dear little hie
boysh—Little Willish. Mosh enjoyablish
“You’d better make your explanation to the
policeman,” interrupted Little Willie s father,
disgustedly beckoning the officer forward.
Nicholas gripped the palings higher up, and
drew himself up with a grave, stately air.
“Strict —hie —instructionsh —not to speak—to
—hie —policemansh,” he murmured, staring
haughtily at the officer.
After an ineffectual clinging to the palings, he
found himself hoisted inside the cab, and soon
afterwards deposited at the watch-house.
“What’s your name?” queried the officer-in-
“ Strict—hie—instructionsh not to—hie—speak
—to policemansh,” answered Nicholas, after
which he relapsed into a dignified silence, from
which nothing could move him.
“Who is he, any way ?” queried the oftcer-in-
charge, testily, seeing no information was toith-
coming from Nicholas. , „ ,
“He’s the wet-nurse at Watsons, answeied
the policeman, with a grin.

THE SHUNTING OF THE
NARK
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
~W~ ~W~y HEN Adam delved and Eve span,
tSg/ Who was then the clergyman l
r r 0 happy world ! There was not one !
But later came a priggish son,
Who tried to rob the globe of light:
The Reverend Abel he was hight.
All joy on earth was brought to pause
By righteous Abel's “ moral ” laws ;
The ’roo must clip his bounds by half,
And laughing jackass cease to laugh,
VIC.
While other birds no more must sing,
Or dance, or spread a brilliant wing.
For Eve and Adam there was gloom
Within a stuffy lecture-room,
Where Abel told them (so he said)
About the time when they'd be dead.
While thus he talked with might and main,
In wrath uprose his brother Cain ;
While Adam delved and Eve span
Cain slew a killjoy clergyman.

Insomnia,
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
LITTLE imps of sin and care—
Shabby shapes—climb up my stair
Every night when stars are out;
And the wind makes gentle rodt
In the tree-tops wistfully,
Like a far moon-flooded sea ;
Every night when tempests shout,
Roaring down eternity ;
At my attic door they cling.
Tap, tap, tapping, whispering.
Vain the bolted gate and bars ;
Like the lightnings of the stars.
Through the shuttered gloom they roll
To devour my hopeless soul;
And my watch-dog, Courage, lies
Whimpering, with old red eyes,
Cowering from each shabby troll,
Till beneath the dark he dies.
So, defenceless and undone,
Hot into the night I run.
Mocking shapes and imps of care
Follow, clacking down the stair.
Fast into the night I race,
For the purple hiding-place.
Yet they trail not far behind,
Crowding down the lonely wind.
Oh, to see the vale of grace !
At the sombre gates to find
Brave-eyed Dreams to hide me deep
In the sanctuary of sleep !
Shadows in a grim deceit
Tangle in my rushing feet;
And the breath of sullen hours
All my hopeless heart o’erpowers,
Chokes me, till my being reels
With the whisp’rers at my heels.
Blacker still the silence lowers ;
Nearer still the wild pack wheels ;
And the echoes trailing after
Freeze me with a low mad laughter.
All night long in fierce unrest
So I make an endless quest,
Harried by those hounds of care,
Imps of sorrow and despair.
Night on night I rise and flee
For the sheltering sanctuary,
Where they may not come, and where
Sleep may come and lie with me.
But the world is blind, alack !
Evermore I lose the track.
Ere the Orient swims in gold,
Or the clouds of dawn unfold,
They, the grim pursuers, fail
Faltering down the twilight pale.
Then across a purple deep
Dimly loom the towers of Sleep....
bfou ! I race in small avail,
For the gates together sweep;
Sweep and bar; the morning falls
Singing down the mountain walls.
* * * *
And the old watch-dog that died
Moves once more with morning-tide,
In the attic at my side.
And his sad eyes dim with fright,
Ask me thro’ their misty sight:
What if they should come to-night ?

C. ALLAN MARRIS.
To Him Who is Weary.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE man who is weary of living—by Jove,
I am weary of him !
I’m sick of his querulous whining, his
lack of the Vitals of Vim ;
I’m tired unto death of his raptures that turn into
gall in his cup ;
I’m sick in my soul of his groaning “I’m done,
and I think I’ll give up ! ”
He tells us he s done with his garland of women
and roses and wine,
And the symphony’s gone he was weaving (a sort
of a musical whine).
In the name of the Fire and the Furies—if there’s
nought in the Valley but Woe,
Let him measure his feet for a coffin, and decently
drop us and Go !
If he’s sick of the Sun and the Sunset, most
likely they’re sick of him too ;
But they don’t make a song of their sickness, and
bellow it up in the blue;
They get right along with their duty— to shine
on the Cow and the Germ,
And care not a curse for the fluty complaint of a,
weariful worm ;
They shine on the man who is moaning ; on him
who, is joyous of cheer ;
And tint with a radiance of glory the nose of the
swiper of Beer;
They’ve duty to, do—and they do it— o, white-
livered wailers of Woe !
So measure your feet for a coffln, and decently
drop us and Go !
He says, “If my Soul were but Ashes ! ”—I wish
to Creation it were,
And whipt by a whirling Tornado to ends of the
Uttermost Air ;
And so we’d be rid of his groaning, “I’m sick of
Existence divine,”
And someone might come and replace him who
boasted a bit of a spine ;
For he who is weary and wailful can take it as
balm to his soul,
That his Pains will the sooner be better the sooner
he gets to his goal;
And the counsel I carefully give him—he’ll find
it is golden, I trow—
Let him measure his feet for a coffin and decently
drop us and Go !
QUEENSLAND.
FURNESS BORN.
THE SOUL
THAT
BOLTED
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Directly i awoke i knew i was in a
state of soular bankruptcy. The maid
came in with my tea, and as I seemed to
be still asleep she left the tray on a little table by
my bedside. I sat up and deliberately upset the
table, breaking all the china and drenching the
rugs with tea and milk. The maid ran back. I
let her think it was an accident, and it made me
feel good to see how distressed she was. She
wears glasses, and when she knelt to clear up the
debris she put them aside. I threw them into
the garden amongst the dense nasturtiums. The
girl’s frantic hunt in my bedroom for her glasses
was most entertaining. When I opened my
window to throw out the glasses a small August
wind from the east rushed in.
“ I met your soul !” said the wind in little
puffs. “It was going east through the bush.
Hadn’t you better get yourself locked up till It
comes back ? ”
Perhaps It won’t come back,” I answered.
“ I know I wouldn’t if I had Its billet. What is
It like ? ”
Rather funny-looking, but very cheerful-
Big eyes, corners of its mouth smile up to the
corners of its eyes.”
“ Nice hands and feet?”
None at all; but a pair of rudimentary wings
like those of a duckling. When It stopped to
rest It sat down on the back of Its neck.”
“I don’t think I’ll go after It,” I said. “It
doesn’t sound attractive. I’ll take my chance of
getting a better one.”
“ I’ve been blowing since Time began,” remon-
strated the warm easterly, “and I never before
met a soul out on the jag without Its body. You’ll
be in gaol before the week’s out. You may be
hanged before the year’s out —if you don’t get It
back.”
“You are talking just what you are, and that’s
wind. Quite one person in a thousand doesn’t
get gaoled or suspended ”
I threw sticks at it,
but all fell short.
The wind began to scream something about my
case being an exception, and asked me to note
the change in myself.” It told me where my
soul could be found—in a place full of trees and
glad grass and moss, where I had camped last
spring.
I determined to follow my soul, but meantime I
was glad to be nasty to anything—even to the
wind. “You keep outside my room,” I said.
“Why do you load yourself up with wattle-bloom
and gum and daffodil scents? You smell so dis-
agreeably. The best winds don’t do it.” Then
I slammed down the window.
During the train journey to Waringay in
pursuit of my soul I enjoyed myself thoroughly.
I contrived to throw a half-blind old lady’s
hand-bag and purse out of the window.
“ A perfect stranger ” asked me to tell
her when we came to Clordona, as she was
short-sighted, and the guard didn’t speak dis-
tinctly. We were just approaching Gordona, but
I told her it was three stations off. We got into
conversation, and she told me with whom she was
going to stay. I had never heard of the lady, but I
informed the perfect stranger that her hostess had
just finished a term of imprisonment for shop-
lifting. Her collapse was so amusing.
At Waringay, where
I left the train, I re-
ported the guard to the
station master for in-
sulting behavior, and
gave as mine the name
and address of the
daughter of one of the
Railway Commis-
sioners. I never saw
anything of its kind
more comic than the
guard’s expression of
face. A doctor ac-
quaintance of mine
overtook me on the
road and offered to
drive me a mile or so.
He was going my way. I accepted
cheerfully, but first went into a
telephone bureau and rang up his
jealous wife:
“Is that Mrs. Sawbones?”
“Yes! ”
“Do you know a Miss MacQuacker?” The
name was that of a girl of whom she was cause-
lessly and furiously jealous. A voice like nitric
acid replied : I know of her ! ”
“If you will go to the rise at the back of your
house you will see your husband driving into the
bush track with a lady dressed in a long brown
coat, a brown boa, and a motoring veil. She is
Miss MacQuacker.”
I could hardly climb into the buggy for laughter.
The doctor mentioned that he had been out
since five that morning, attending a medical
friend, Dr. Cascara, who was very ill of pneu-
moma *
“Dr. Cascara!” I echoed, lazily. “A very
careless talker, isn’t he?”
“ I have no reason to think so. Why?”
“ Oh, nothing—only the other evening, at the
Winterview Smiths, the talk turned on doctors,
and he said that Dr. Bitteraloes was practising on
a forged diploma.”
The doctor dropped the reins, and the horse
bolted for a space.
“Dr. Bitteraloes is my brother-in-law” re-
marked my neighbor, after a significant pause.
Of course I had known that.
Ye parted on the verge of the forest track.
I art of my way lay through a plantation of baby
fruit trees. I pulled up a few hundreds, and
dropped among them the doctor’s
handkerchief, which I had stolen.
His name was on it.
My soul was lying on a patch of
moss, with Its wings under Its
head, when It saw me. It half
flew, half scrambled, up on to the
limb of a gum high above my
head, and hung there smiling down
at me.
I threw sticks at it, but all fell
short. I got a long branch and
tried to brush it down, but It
only moved higher up, still smiling
with comical curiosity.
“Why did you leave ?” I asked
desperately, when my last missile
fell back on my ear. “Wasn’t
I a good employer ? ”
“I don’t remember any former
employers,” It replied, “and I’m
still fond of you. But I’m tired.
I want a day out every ten years.
You are always prying on me,
and trying to get me under the
lens—‘ intellectual lens,’ you’d call
it. ITgh !”
Still smiling, It dropped forward and
hung head downwards, looking at me in-
terestedly.
“ You msiy have a day out every month,” I
tree ’ ” Ut y ° U Sp6nd — U P a
There you are a grain, prying on me ! Asking
me how I’ll spend my day of freedom ! ”
T ..,,, , „ ,
I sat down at the base of the tree and began to
cry. Presently It came and squatted on my
shoulder, Poking round about with infantile
curiosity and cheerfulness.
I spent the afternoon with my soul.
Towards sunset It said : “ I’ll stay on your
shoulder and you may carry me home.”
It was quite heavy, but I was afraid to com-
plain. For obvious reasons, I did not make for
Waringay station. My soul declined to get back
to wherever in me It lived. It said Its day was
not up. So, when close to the station, I took It
off my shoulder, wrapped It out of sight in my
motor veil, and boarded the train.
The guard said : “ Animals not allowed in pas-
senger compartments, lady. You’ve time to get
a dog-box, and, if that’s a ’possum ”
“ This is not a ’possum,” I interrupted angrily.
He continued to look suspiciously at the wriggling
bundle, and in a growing fright I bluffed :
“Perhaps now you’ll tell me babies are not
allowed in passenger compartments.” At the in-
stant my soul stuck its smiling head and one
stubbly wing out and looked inquisitively
at the guard. He fell backwards between the
couplings of the carriages, but as the train was
not moving no harm resulted.
I fled from the train to the cabstand, covering
up my burden as I ran. It was squirming rest-
lessly. I told a man on the rank to drive me to
Mosman. He looked interestedly at my bundle,
and asked: “Would that like to run behind a
piece, lady?”
“Is that dog registered , madam?" he asked.
I told him that That most certainly would not,
and he became apologetic,
The soul was sitting on my knee during the
drive, and we were nearing our journey s end
when the cabman looked down through ne roof
window. It looked up at him.
I don’t clearly recollect what followed. A
rearing horse, a wrecked cab, a scared man.
I and It came out of the crash unhurt, and I was
leading It down our road in the twilight, one end
of my long boa tied round Its neck, when a
policeman stopped us.
“ Is that dog registered, madame?” he asked.
“That is not a dog,” I said, with some annoy
ance - He looked closer.
“ Wha-what is it, then?”
“ H’s a sou l ! ”
I’m quite sure he would have arrested me for
‘ language ” if It had not saved me by disappear-
ing. It went back to wherever It lived in me.

The Athlete.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE Athlete was a mighty man
When Greece was young, and life was
strong;
He boxed or wrestled, leapt or ran,
Or threw the discus. With that throng
Who sang the lofty lyric ode
Or built the Sophoclean play,
Elate he marched down Glory’s road ;
But even more than poets they
Who won the palm, the olive crown
In grand Olympian victory,
Their deeds proud cities handing down
In marble’s immortality.
At many a storied Grecian game
The Athlete strove for pride of race
Till, substituting gold for fame,
The Gladiator took his place.
And now the Ped. is but a pro.;
The Boxer sleeps for seven rounds ;
Footballers ramble to and fro
To boot the bladder out of bounds.
The jockey rides to lose ; and some
Feel proud their champion never tries;
For sport, called manly, has become
A sound commercial enterprise.
And even more advanced are they
Who never spin a spheroid, nor
The mittens don, ride, row, or play,
But barrack and discuss the score.
The modern Athlete lives to bet
And air his verbal violence; '
He puffs his weary cigarette,
And stands behind a picket fence.

TO KEEP TOO Sltll
THE first impulse of persons who find that they are ailing in any way is to plunge into a chemist’s
and purchase a box of pills or a bottle of some patent medicine. Failing to get more than temporary
relief from this they then consult a doctor, and he writes a prescription which more than likely
calls for the same medicine, only in a different form from what the patient has already taken. The same
result, generally. Next, the patient comes to the conclusion that the doctor did not diagnose the case
right, and then goes to another with the same result. And so on.
Our modern medical system is a foolish system. We practically pay our doctors to
keep us ill. Their prosperity depends not on our health, BUT ON OUR SICKNESS t
To-day very little is known of medicine and its use. The wisest doctor can do but
little more than clear out the system or accelerate the action of the heart When he has
done these things he has reached the end. MEDICINE CANNOT MAKE STRENGTH'
The failure or breaking-down of any organic function means that it has not the strength to do its
work. If there was any nourishment in medicine it might bring about a healthy change, but you know
there is NOT. Drugs, medicines, stimulants, narcotics and antidotes are POISONS, not food. Food is
needed to build up new energy. Electricity is nerve food, nerve life. No pain or debility can exist in a
body charged with Electric Fife ; you can have no Weakness, no Inactive Parts, no Rheu-
matism, Indigestion, Constipation, or Kidney Trouble, if you fill your body with
it because the life generated by this grand force gives health and strength to everv or mm and

The Old Bohemian Days.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
OMA BELLE , via Marguerite,
Have I kept your carriage waiting ?
Just this once forgive me, Sweet,
Just this once forbear your rating !
Am I not your loyal vassal,
Marguerite ? Your lightest tassel
Sways not easier to your motion !
Can you question my devotion
When I tell you this white hand
Led me—do you understand ?
From the unconventional country, the unfashion-
able land,
From that bad Bohemia ?
Memories of long ago,
Merry days too gay for lasting
Haunt me even now, you know :
Nights of feasting ! Nights of fasting !
Fearless frolic, fun, and laughter,
Dreams of Fame to follow after,
Dreams of world-wide recognition !
(Idle visions ! Vain ambition !)
Yet the glory of it then !
All the world before us when
We aspiring, fought and failed, just to rise and
fight again,
In our mad Bohemia.
Some of us have clutched the crown,
Snatched a leaf from fading laurels ;
Some gone up—but more gone down
Where go ruined minds and morals.
But Constantia—sweetest singer !
Now that kings and princes fling her
Diamonds, for our pansy posies,
Rubies redder than our roses—
Amethyst for Violet—
Does Constantia forget ?
Or in these her palmy days has she recollections
yet
Of our gay Bohemia ?
Jones has gained a moment’s fame
By a vilely-written novel ;
Brown, the poet—to our shame
He calls home a wretched hovel,
Fame and Fortune passed him over ;
Smith the lawyer’s quite in clover ;
And the others ? They are scattered
Hither, thither—has it mattered ?
I, yes I, who’ve paced the street,
Lacking very bread to eat,
Now in most conventional manner sit and sing at
Fashion’s feet
Far from sad Bohemia.
O, ma Marguerite, ma belle !
Time goes by, and we grow older ;
Once I loved Bohemia well—
Even love itself grows colder !
And the glamor has departed,
Left us wise, and sadder-hearted ;
Yet forgive me, Marguerite,
If those bad, mad days seem sweet !
If in dreams I greet once more
My old cronies, as of yore,
In our good Bohemian fashion. What ! The
carriage at the door ?
Fare thee well, Bohemia !
ENGLAND.
DORA WILCOX.
The Old Horse.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE sun glared fiercely down, and a hot still-
ness hung about the town. Finneran, on
his way from market, had visions of am-
brosial liquid, and hung to them like a drowning
man to a hencoop. He flicked his horse to a
faster pace as a picture of a shady spot and a
drink rose before him. Inside the cart five pigs
were miserably uncomfortable, mixed together in
bound helplessness.
The heat was appalling, and it took Finneran
all his time to prevent himself bolting into the first
pub that came to sight. But his mental vision
was fixed on a point further down the road where
many of his cronies congregated and the beer was
of the first water.
When Finneran had reached his goal he almost
ran into the bar, and was happy, at last. Mean-
while, the old horse stood outside untied, but
tying seemed unnecessary ; he appeared a dead
finish. Stillness reigned, and the old horse fell
into slumber, and dreamed of shady nooks and
much water and grass. He moved one foot, then
the other, and, half-waking, half-dreaming, he
journeyed slowly along, a horse with one idea—
shady nooks, green grass, and much water.
About 40 yards farther down the road was the
“ take off” to the punt. It was steep, and before
the old horse was aware, he was being propelled
downwards by the weight of the cart and the pigs
behind him. The punt just then happened to be
on the other side. Resistance was useless, and
the moke went downward to his doom. He was
pushed into the river, and the cart drowned him.
The water was ten feet deep at that point, and
the tide was flowing merrily out, and so the pigs
floated away towards the ocean.
A messenger tore in and interrupted Finneran
midway in a vast beer and a tall story. Finneran
stared wildly at him for three-seconds-and-a-half,
and then rushed out, omitting to complete his
beer. Ere one could say “ Behold,” the earth
seemed to open and vomit forth population. The
local horse-liar surged up and down like a town-
crier, betting hundreds that the horse was dead. He
was betting on a dead cert, someone informed
him, but he still flung odds round with awful
prodigality. Presently the local constable bore
down upon the crowd to preserve the peace.
He came in last, as is only fit and right for a con-
stable to do, but he was quite nonchalant. Worse
things had happened to him than dead horses.
Pie sailed down with the benign smile of one who
has power and yet can afford, at times, to be
lenient to his fellow-men. Finneran was swear-
ing torrentially, and the mighty officer had to chip
in more than once to quell the flow.
Then someone entered the water and tied a rope
to the cart, and forty men, with many a mighty
heave and grunt, hauled the whole show out.
Finneran wept over the carcase. Horses were
dear in his part, and the season had been rotten.
Discussion as to whether a dead horse weighed
more than a live one was rife. Someone said
that no live horse could draw the dead horse and
cart up the incline. The butcher saw his way to
making a bob or two. “ I’ll bet anyone an even
fiver,” he cried, “ that my horse can shift the lot at
one pull! ” Pie found a taker. Money appeared,
but the vast bulk of the policeman stepped in and
nearly tripped over his brogue. “No, no, me
bhoys,” he said, “if yez want to bet, it’s not in
the public thoroughfare ye’ll do it.” The local
horse-liar flung himself through the crowd and
defied authority.
The crowd yelled at the butcher to bring forth
the horse. The butcher departed, and presently
returned with the steed, which he hitched to the
cart. The liar bet “io to lin quids” against
the lot being shifted. He had walked all round
the show, and thought he was on safe ground.
The live animal stood to attention and scarcely
noticed the late lamented. Then the crowd held
its breath, and the butcher urged his moke to
pull. The horse’s flanks heaved, and he strained
to snapping-point, but he was an honest horse,
and with a magnificent effort he moved up the
grade. The butcher had won, and in spite of the
huge policeman the money changed hands. The
liar raved madly.
Finneran was as a man in a dream. His first
outburst over, he had remained dumb, and now,
with head bowed, he returned to the pub and tried
to drown his sorrow. But, late in the afternoon,
thoughts of an angry “ missus ” worked through
his dazed senses, and he left his haven sadly.
With crushed spirit he waded through the sizzling
heat of the afternoon and made his way to the
punt.
The sun looked down and laughed.
W.P.B.
The Sacrifice.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
DUG they twain, to bury in
Its clammy depth and cold,
A narrow grave to hide their Sin,
The scarlet Sin of old ;
Deep and narrow by the brink
Of the River Cease-to-Care,
Where the stars of Heaven blink
At their drowned shadows there.
Lifted they their stifled Love—-
Born too late, perchance too soon ;
Choked with cords of good Resolve,
Underneath a winter moon.
Oh, my Lady pale, your sighs
Pierced me with accusing pain !
Oh, my Lady, from your eyes
Fell the salt and bitter rain !
Laid they down the shrouded Dead.
Of a won'drous Might-Have-Been,
With a Lily at its head,
And a Rose its hands between.
Swearing by the Saviour pure,
On His sacrificial tree,
Each to suffer and endure
All the after-grief to be.
Clod by clod, and stone by stone,
Under High-Intent they hid,
Spite of tear or sigh or moan,
That appealing coffin lid.
Oh, my Lady, was it well
That ye failed not by the grave,
Losing Heaven, finding Hell,
Ashing Christ your Souls to save !
So he fled, to leave behind
What his heart might ne’er forget.
So, she turned the Land to find
Of Forgetful Unregret.
Northward, with imploring eyes
Strode the Lover on his quest;
South, beneath o’erclouded skies,
Stole the Maid who loved him best.
But for ever with him rove
Ghostly wraiths of Love denied,
And a ghost of murdered Love
Stalks for ever at her side.
Nought the Saviour on His tree,
Hanging stern and strangely pale,
Nought the Grief of Calvary
Shall their aching hearts avail!
VIC.

THE AUSTRALIAN MAGAZINE.
Founded in May, 1907, and scarcely,
therefore, a year-old yet, The Lone Hand
has already established itself as the Aus-
tralian magazine. In Australia and Maoriland it
is sold in every town, and
reaches almost every home.
Wherever white settlement has
been established in Asia, The
Lone Hand is to be found.
In Europe, subscribers and
contributors are common, not
only in Great Britain, but in
F ranee, Germany, Austria,
Italy, and Switzerland. To
the top of the Matterhorn
glacier, to the lonely Car-
pathians, as well as to the
artistic haunts of Parisian
Bohemia, The Lone Hand
has penetrated. In South
Africa and America it steadily
gains ground.
This almost miraculous
success can be ascribed mainly
to the fact that The Lone Hand depicts Aus-
tralia ; it is the sunshine and the enterprise of
the great Commonwealth in magazine form, and
interests all who are interested in Australia.
And there is no cliqueism
about The Lone Hand. The
editorial policy is to accept
bright copy from any quarter,
and to look to the quality of
the stuff rather than to the
name beneath. It is no organ
of a coterie, no slave of a
school, no routine production
of a few accepted men. Not
less than 30 artists, embracing
all the front-rank men in Aus-
tralia, contribute to its picture
pages. Its writers number
over 100 : and bright copy is
accepted from any and every
quarter.
It is by the use of these
great resources that The Lone

ON THE MATTERHORN GLACIER.
A little Australienne with The Lone Hand.
It’s the highest t>oint the Magazine has yet reached.
“ grooviness ” which is the sign of decay. Its
readers never know exactly what to expect in
The Lone Hand, but can always rely on some-
thing absorbingly interesting.
Artistic color and black-
and-white printing is made a
feature of The Lone Hand.
Its aim is to give, with every
issue, at leastjialf-a-dozen pages
worthy, when framed, of adorn-
ing the walls of the home in
bush or town.
To serve the public good
by prompt and merciless ex-
posure of drug frauds, food
frauds, and all other devices
for victimising the public, is
another essential of The Lone
Hand policy. After only eight
months of existence the maga-
zine can already point proudly
to a big list of “exposures”
for the public good, under-
taken fearlessly, and carried out sternly.
From six to a dozen bright, varied stories;
a couple of articles on the great resources of
the Commonwealth ; half-a-
dozen literary, artistic and
musical causeries; some per-
sonal sketches ; a skilled selec-
tion (in a subsidiary section)
from the best of the world’s
literature that’s a typical
Lone Hand.
Can you afford to be with-
out it ?
If there are any Bulletin
readers who have not yet seen
The Lone Hand, we ask
them to send at once for a
sample copy. If there is any
Bulletin reader with an ob-
stinate friend abroad who has
not yet been convinced of the
greatness of Australia, send

A GOOD REASON
Why you should consult me if you have any SCALP
DISEASE or HAIR TROUBLE. I have made THEIR
CURE A LIFE’S STUDY. I have not taken it up
BECAUSE there is fIONEY to be made out of it, but
because I am an ADMIRER OF GOOD HAIR and a
Believer IN NATURE.
AN ALL-WISE GOD has put hair
on a man’s head to grow, and to
CONTINUE TO GROW until his
physical power decays. If the hair falls
out WHILE HE IS IN THE FULL
VIGOR OF MANHOOD, Commonsense
says: You are not treating it as it
ought to be treated ; you are simply
STARVING IT. It is PERISHING
for the wane of NUTRIMENT. Every-
day in putting your head under the TAP
or SHOWER, you are EXTRACTING
the LIFE BLOOD from your hair. Stop
the sap from passing up a tree and its
decay is inevitable ; so it is with the hair.
The more PIGMENT AND LUBRI-
CATING OILS the hair gets the more
ďf
luxuriant the growth. Extract that from the hair, and it must be
FATAL to its growth. When scented oils, marrow fats and
pomatums were used, everybody had good hair. Since they have been dis-
carded, it is an exception to see a good head of hair. The wretched FASHION
of keeping the hair very dry is most debilitating to it. That, with
the constant washing, is responsible for its PREMATURE DECAY. The
QUACK with his NOSTRUM tells you not to use oil, as it chokes up the
pores. I should like to know what the pores have to do with the growth of
the hair. The PIGMENT AND LUBRICATING OIL necessary for its
growth and color do not come through the pores of the scalp, but through
the FOLLICLE and along the HAIR SHAFTS.
To secure a good head of hair, and to keep it healthy, there is not a
more effectual preparation than my HAIR RESTORER. It contains all
the essential elements necessary to keep healthy a good head of hair. It is
a splendid preparation for CHILDREN’S HAIR. It removes scurf and
dryness, and gives the hair a glossy appearance. FOR GENTLEMEN,
if the scalp is beginning to show through the hair, Parasene Special
applied at night, and COSITIO Lotion in the morning, quickly pro-
duces a good head of hair. Price, with postage, 11s* 6dh
FOR LADIES—If the hair is falling out badly, Restorer applied
at night, and Cosmo Lotion in the morning, has the desired effect-
Price, by post, Us. 6d.
Why Have Grey Hair ?
Naturaline speedily restores grey and faded hair to its natural
color. It is guaranteed to be perfectly harmless. It is good for the Beard
and Moustache. It is made in all shades—LlGHT BROWN, MEDIUM
BROWN, DARK BROWN, and EXTRA STRONG FOR BLACK
HAIR. Price, by post —VICTORIA, 6Sa 3d. Other States and New
Zealand, 6S. Bda
Letters arrive daily from all points of the compass, bearing eloquent and
most convincing testimony to the fact that my Preparations stand head and
shoulders above every other preparation on the market. They are successful
in arresting the premature decay of the hair, and restoring its growth, after
all other preparations have failed.
No better TESTIMONIAL could be given to the value of my prepara-
tions than the following:—By recommendation alone, before one shilling
was spent in advertising, they were used in fifteen countries, and to-day the
demand for them is increasing rapidly.
ONE OF THE LEADING DOCTORS IN MELBOURNE says
“If there are any preparations that will make the hair grow, these
RESTORERS will.”
Another Doctor says :—“ Mr. Holland has treated and cured my wife’s
and daughter’s hair most successfully. I can recommend his TREATMENT
AND PREPARATIONS WITH CONFIDENCE, knowing them to be of
the most genuine character.”

your wonderful Hair Vigor. I was almost
bald headed before I used the Hair Vigor. I
still use it once a day, rubbing it well into the
roots of the hair. I used to wear a skull-cap,
and I am very grateful to Ayer’s Hair Vigor
for the improvement it has made in my looks.”
Be warned in time. Use Ayer’s
Hair Vigorand preserve your youth.

Give yourself
a Christmas
Present
“THE DICTAPHONE.”
Give yourself a Christmas Present, because no member of your
family will be likely to give it to you unless they read this.
The Dictaphone saves your time—Saves your money—and
Saves office labor.
It s like having a perfect stenographer all the time at your elbow, silent, in-
visible, always ready, writing as fast as you can talk—recording just what
you say in your own language. Was ever a- stenographer like this ?
Well, hardly !
Think of it ! The Dictaphone never keeps you waiting. It cannot make a
mistake. You can never talk too fast for it. You can never tire it. It has no
hours to keep, and is your servant, bound by your will to ceaseless service.
You use the ’phone, not the mail, when you want quick service.
\ ou use the Dictaphone, not the stenographer, for the same reason.
The Dictaphone is a twin brother to the telephone. Can you afford to do
without it ?
Make yourself a Christmas Present, and
“ Tell it to the Graphophone.”
For complete information, cut out this advt.,
write name and address on margin, and mail to us.

The Leader of Them AH!
That is, Ayer’s Sarsaparilla; not
some other kind, but “Ayer’s.”
This grand old family medicine
has stood the test for over sixty
years. That’s the kind you
should take. You cannot afford
to experiment, your health is
too precious.
You may not now be really ill
from some well-defined disease, and yet
you know you are all run down, your
nerves are unstrung, and you feel weak
and discouraged.
AYER’S Sarsaparilla
is the strongest and best medicine you can
take to remove this tired and exhausted
feeling. It brings cheer, hope, courage.
As now made, Ayer’s Sarsaparilla contains no alcohol.
There are many imitation Sarsaparillas that will disap-
point you. Be sure that you get “AYER’S.”
Prepared by Dr. J. C. Ayer & Co., Lowell, Mass., U. S. A.
