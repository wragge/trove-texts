The RED PAGE
WILLIAM DR MURGAN
IN 1860 a boy of twenty threw a
bundle of MS. into the fire, and
decided to give up literature for art.
From painting unsuccessful pictures he
graduated into stained-glass work, and
thence to ceramics, ultimately erecting a
factory and producing beautiful lustre
tiles. Owing to the disclosure of his
secret process to the trade, through the
dishonesty of former work-people, the
factory ceased to exist. Meantime he let.
his interest in literature lapse, though
preserving an admiration for Thackeray
and Dickens. And, after a literary sleep
of forty-seven years, this Rip Van Winkle
—at the age of 65—published a novel,
and at one bound he “arrived.” The
name of this newest novelist, whose
career suggests the case of Du Maurier,
is William de Morgan.
Having found himself at 65, de Mor-
gan is not wasting time. Within a year
of his first success he followed it with
another, and his third novel has just been
announoed. And his books are not slight
works, hastily compiled for a ravening
public. Joseph Vance and Allce-for-Short
range from 280,000 to 300,000 words in
length—three times the length of the
ordinary modern novel. And, as much
of both books is composed of extracts
from letters and MS. in diminutive type,
these bulky books are not attractive to
the reader. The English novel has sud-
denly gone back to the three-deckers of
the early Victorian era.
De Morgan’s complete acceptance by
critics and public is explicable on the
theory that temporarily readers are tired
of the modern novel with its problem
plot, or its epigrammatic dialogue, or its
compact criticism of contemporary morals,
or its lush sentimentalism. Here is a
return to an earlier, looser form, pleasant
to dally over for a fortnight. Here is
just a slice of life—a length (to para-
phrase Chesterton) cut off the delightful,
companionable, genial, humorous, ob-
servant personality of William de Morgan.
It is a reminiscence of Dickens, but of a
more subtle, less flamboyant, less riotous
Dickens, with in it much of Thackeray’s
sympathetic knowledge of men. Dickens
frequently burlesques, frequently senti-
mentalises, frequently caricatures, fre-
quently slops over into bathos. De
Morgan’s characters are not eccentrics ;
they are sanely human, indubitably alive.
His stage is large and crowded. His novels
begin at childhood and go right on, dis-
cursively, to old age. Characters that are
young in the first chapter grow up, grow
old and die, and the story runs on. Other
characters compel our interest, and they
get married and have large families, and
still the story rambles on. In Alice-for-
Short the narrative breaks off in the
middle, the author suddenly skips six-
teen years, and after that pause the
story ripples on. De Morgan could have
given us the whole history of that six-
teen years, and we would have not
grumbled—though it would have added
another fortnight to our reading of the
novel. And with his large view of life it
is inevitable that the author must feel
its pathos ; for the characters die off, or
get married, or drop out one by one—
just as they do in real life ; and at the
end his people begin to feel rather lonely
—just as they do in real life. But these
books are not very dull, neither are they
very witty. They are just narratives,
without any particular plot, told by a
skilled and charming raconteur to an
audience that forgets to grow restless.
He buttonholes his reader, but the victim
soon forgots that important engagement
which he had at first pleaded. You pick
up the book, and probably, after a dozen
chapters, you throw it away ; but you
will pick it up again. You have to.
Let us begin with a specimen of the
Morganatic manner Joseph Vance begins
discursively thus :
My father and mother never could come
to a clear understanding about what had dis-
agreed with my father the day he lost his
situation at Fothergill’s.
My father thought it was the sausage and
mashed potatoes he had for lunch at the
Rose and Crown, at fourpence, and as much
mustard and pepper as you liked. My
mother thought it was the beer. There was
something to be said for my mother’s view,
on the score of quantity. .. . Anyhow,
something must have disagreed with him,
or he wouldn’t have called Mr. Wotherspoon,
the head clerk at Fothergill’s, an old herring-
gut when he told him to put his trolley
somewhere else, and not leave it stood in the
orfice door.
That dismissal was the making of the
elder Mr. Vance. The story of his
astounding rise to wealth, owing to his
discovery of the principle that an employer
should never do a hand's turn himself, is
one of the most delightful incidents in
fiction. And the elder Vance’s conversion
to temperance is quite humanly treated,
for, of course, he goes back to the whisky
bottle. But Mrs. Vance dies, and Mr.
Vance marries his servant-maid, and he
dies, and the servant-maid marries again,
and the story prattles on—a collection of
charming essays and generous slabs of
humor and pathos and commonsense
that cry out for the big blue pencil.
What a book it might have been made
if only condensed and sternly edited !
And yet, what, after all, could one
put the big blue pencil through with-
out spoiling the charm of the whole ?. . . .
<63?
Here, for instance, is an example
of his garrulous irrelevance—the last
paragraph in a chapter :
The Doctor and I walked over to Chelsea,
talking of the subject Beppino had inter-
rupted. The fog had lifted, and a thaw was
setting in. The wind was thinking of coming
from the south-west, and a little came as we
crossed Clapham Common. When a sudden
mild fit of this sort comes in midwinter,
people are ungrateful and call it unseason-
able, and pretend they like frost. They are
liars and hypocrites, as they enjoy it
thoroughly. We did, on this walk, but we
paid our tribute to orthodox views, never-
theless.
And how the reader’s fingers itch for
the big blue pencil here !
Whether Mr. Pope was right or wrong in
his views about Municipal G-overnment at
that date is no concern of ours. We merely
record what he said. Our reasons for giving
the conversation at all are not quite clear to
ourselves, because all we want to know is
that Pope and Chappell took the basement
(etc., etc. . . .). But, having written out
this conversation, it may stand.
But de Morgan himself disarms criti-
cism. There is nothing to be done with
an author who interpolates a remark like
this :
Now, if you skipped the place where I
told you of this, you won’t know what I
mean. Skip this too.
While, at page 478, he cheekily anno-
tates :
If you have forgotten all about this, see
page 111.
<53?
The mechanism of his stories is elabo-
rate and old-fashioned. In Joseph Vance
there is the ancient device of accounting
for the publication of an autobiography
that, if real, could not possibly have been
given to the world. This is managed by a
long note, allegedly by the editor, and a
postscript, allegedly by the publishers.
And in Alice-for-Short there is a Mystery—
a dear, old-fashioned Mystery, with bones
in cellars and legends and ghosts ; and at
the end the Mystery, which de Morgan
seems to imagine the most important
thing in his book, is further, and quite
superfluously, cleared up by an addendum
containing extracts from a MS. Alice-
for-Short is neither better nor worse than
Joseph Vance. It is merely another mile
or two cut off from the apparently inex-
haustible flowing length of William de
Morgan ; but in the earlier chapters the
mind of a very little child is depicted
with a skill comparable to that of Hardy
in Jude the Obscure and James in What
Maisie Knew.
Not only is the Morganatic method
medieval in plot construction, but his
chapter headings are charmingly antique.
Here are two :
This chapter is really all devoted to Dr.
Thorpe s opinions, although it pretends not
at the beginning. Better skip them. A
quotation from Tennyson. Janey ana Joe
make each a promise to the other.
Now Alice knew all about it. Alice's ring
and the jewels thereon. Miss Straker's long
letter, which Charles did not read to his
father. But how about Exeter Hall ? Of
scrunchy days and squashy days. How people
talk. Was Charles perhaps unfair, after all ?
(3?
However, we can forgive all this old-
fashioned paraphernalia for the shrewd
and whimsical personality of the author,
instanced by such remarks as these :
Can anyone explain why it is that Aunts
have always to be treated with such tact and
discretion ? It is certainly my own experi-
ence that the Human Race appears to be
always taking care not to give offence to its
Aunts, and avoiding subjects which are
likely to hurt the feelings of its Aunts, and
wondering what Aunt This will say when she
hears of That. Is not each man’s Mother
some other man’s Aunt ? and many men’s
Aunts (however painful the fact may be)
several other persons’ Mothers ?
I don’t think that brides feel nearly
so confident of never being widows as bride-
grooms that they will never be widowers. . . .
So, if each man had not an inner conviction
that other people would lose their wives, but
not he—well, would any man dare to marry ?
Or would he not, if he married, seek for
some mate he would be glad to get rid of ?
Would he not shudder at all Love, except
the sort that never lasts ? Would he not
rejoice and be merry when Mrs. Smith was
not down to breakfast, and when he came
home, wet and tired and disheartened, to
find that Mrs. Smith had not waited dinner
for him, but had gone to an interesting lec-
ture, would he not hug himself and be happy
anH say that now here was a chance of a real
comfortable evening ? By assiduous cultiva-
tion of this attitude of mind, he would avoid
a possibly overwhelming grief for himself, and
by affording a stimulus to a reciprocal feel-
ing on the part of his wife, would fortify her
to endure his loss with resignation, and to
look forward to it with equanimity.
He was an example of a Christian who had
endeavored to strain off the teachings of
Jesus the Nazarene from the scum and the
dregs of the world and the churches, and had
never been able to decide on the mesh of
his strainer. He always seemed to be en-
deavoring to find a sieve that would let
Christ through, and keep the Miracles out.
Do what he would, the Resurrection slipped
past. The stone that was rolled away from
the Sepulchre broke a hole in the mesh, and
the Gadarene swine found it out and came
through with a rush, and then a new sieve
had to be provided, and the whole operation
repeated.
Alice wished very much to stop and dig
for worms—a fascinating- and absorbing em-
ployment ; but for its full enjoyment a fork
is necessary. Practised with a spade, especi-
ally a wooden one, it is painful to the
worms ; and also, except he be hard of
heart, to the digger. If a vivisector by pro-
fession and prone to scientific observation, he
may derive instruction from the way in which,
when a worm is halved, its intellectual end
wriggles, but no one, scientific or otherwise,
can pretend to be satisfied with an amputa-
tion by a blunt spade. And the inconven-
ience to the worm of being forced through
the sand when the spade is too blunt to cut
it, is, we hope, obvious. A parasol, or sun-
shade, though it may spare the worm, is apt
to be fruitless and platonic.
(£3?
William de Morgan must be put up in
the select list of modern English novelists,
side by side with Snaith, Galsworthy,
May Sinclair, and Hewlett—with Hardy
and Meredith still towering above. With
all their faults, Alice-for-Short and Joseph
Vance are hereby admitted into the
Class FI.
A N AMERIC IN NOVEL
An excellent example of the machine-
made type of novel is The Fruit of the Tree,
by Edith Wharton (Scribner’s). Mrs.
Wharton has acclimatised in America the
traditional solid, workmanlike, deliberate
English novel. But her latest work lacks
constructive power—the ability to work out
gradually, and with cumulative force, one
broad and well-based theme. Bather, The
Fruit of the Tree is three fruits. First there
is the question of the personal relation of
the employer to the conditions of employ-
ment in a large mill ; next an- examination
of woman’s inability to grasp any issue but
the personal one ; and, finally, the nice
problem whether a person suffering f rotll
an incurable disease, doomed to incessant
pain, should be put out of her misery.
The last issue might have made a less
tedious book ; indeed, it should have been
the book. Mrs. Wharton looks on life with
her intellect, not her emotions ; she is
frostily brilliant, sombrely glittering. She
feels with her brain. This mental hardness
gives a chill and repellant aspect to her
psychology. She has for her characters
merely the aloof professional interest of the
nurse for a “ pretty case ” ; she forgets the
patient in her scientific delight in the
disease. The human thrill, the womanly
sympathy are lacking. There are no dim
shadows in the picture ; it is lit crudely and
glaringly with the electric light of the
operating theatre. So, lacking the human
touch, the human weakness and warmth,
Edith Wharton remains outside the rank of
the great writers.
(3?
But in observation of life, pithily ex-
pressed, the book abounds. The author’s
style is precise, logical, neat, and frequently
epigrammatic. Here are a few of her cyni-
cisms :
“Well—he had learned at last that
one must never ask from women any view
but the personal one, any measure of con-
duct but that of their own pains and plea-
sures . . .
“ It seemed to her that the tragic crises
in wedded life usually turned on the stupidity
of one of the two concerned ; and of the two
victims of such a catastrophe she felt most
for the one whose limitations had probably
brought it about. After all, there could be
no imprisonment as cruel as that of being
bounded by a small hard nature. Not to be
penetrable at all points to the shifting lights,
the wandering music of the world—she could
imagine no physical disability as cramping as
that. How the little parched soul, in solitary
confinement for life, must pine and dwindle
in its blind cranny of self-love ! . . .
“Most marriages are a patchwork of jarring
tastes and ill-assorted ambitions—if here and
there, for a moment, two colors blend, two
textures are the same, so much the better
for the pattern ! . . .
“ Until now there had not arisen in their
lives one of those searching questions which
call into play emotions rooted far below
reason and judgment, in the dark primal
depths of inherited feeling. It is easy to judge
impersonal problems intellectually, turning
on them the full light of acquired know-
ledge ; but too often one must still grope
one’s way through the personal difficulty by
the dim taper carried in long-dead hands. . . .
“Life is not a matter of abstract prin-
ciples, but a succession of pitiful compro-
mises with fate, of concessions to old tradi-
tion, old beliefs, old charities, and frailties.
And she had humbled herself to accept the
lesson, seeing human relations at last as a
tanglted and deep-rooted growth, a dark
forest through which the idealist cannot cut
his straight path without hearing at each
stroke the cry of the severed branch : ‘ Why
woundest thou me ? ’ ”
(3?
On the point whether under all circum-
stances human life is sacred, Edith Wharton
has no hesitations. Thus she argues :
“ And the suffering is unavoidable?”
“ Unhappily.”
“ And bound to increase ? ”
“ Well —as the anaesthetics lose their effect. . .”
“These new devices for keeping people alive,”
Mr. Tredegar continued; “they increase the
suffering besides prolonging it?”
“Yes—in some cases.”
“ In this case ? ”
“ I am afraid so.”
“ I wish to God she had been killed ! ” he said.
“ It’s infernal—the time they can make it last.”
“ It’s useless ! ” Justine broke out.
“Useless? Well, that’s beside the' point—
since it’s inevitable.”
She wavered a moment. “ Why inevitable?”
“ Human life is sacred,” he said, sententiously.
“Ah, that must have been decreed by someone
who had never suffered ! ” Justine exclaimed.
Mr. Tredegar smiled compassionately. “Society
decreed it—not one person,” he corrected.
“ Society—science—religion ! ” she murmured,
as if to herself.
“Precisely. It’s the universal consensus—the
result of the world’s accumulated experience.
Cruel in individual cases—necessary for the
general welfare.”
Ultimately the nurse gives her friend the
overdose that kills her. And a year after
she marries the widower. Hence the book.

Lean Years.
The purple of these later years—fine linen and
the rest:
The wines and grub and gorgeous girls we
sybarites love best ;
These things don’t seem to matter when, some
night, the breezes lift.
To us the smell of timber and the scent of smoke
a-drift
Through shadowed, wild bush-spaces—or a-crawl
across the plain
Where Lord Sheep’s sweating servants spend
their evenings off the chain ;
When we recall, at times like these, the rare,
resplendent beers
We used to snare aforetime—hear us brag of our
lean years !
The years are shorter now—they shuffle c/f and
drift away
And drop into oblivion's pit; dull parsons preach
and pray,
And fat years bring more counsel than the lean
years ever brought
In the wav of priestly precept—O the sins that
should be fought !
And, with it all, our souls wax gross and the days
go roaring by
In the pride of pleasant city life, and the lust o’
the roving eye;
And the only rough soul-shaking comes to him of
us who hears
A sound or smells a scent from out those far, lean,
toiling years.
Lean years ! We humped our swag of toil, nor
thought of leanness then, '
Nor bothered to remark on how the lean years
turned out men.
Although we toiled on two-mile tracks, with Hell
hung overhead,
And the stars gave us our blankets, and we’d
boulders for our bed ;
Although we camped at crib-time under canopies
of flame,
Our troubles drifted by—our sorrows counted in
the game;
We bore our loads and faced it all with laughter
(and some tears —
As when Jack Johnson broke his neck at work in
the old, lean years).
The lobster on his lettuce, and the silver-mounted
fowl,
Tall bottles of cool liquor, and the slushy-men that
prowl
To pounce upon your empties and to cart bare
bones away—
These fat-year things are cheering, and good
liquor makes you gay ;
But when the Middle-aged comes in with various
Maidens fair,
You think, to see him lazily cast out his anchor
there,
And gambol with his fatted nymphs, his clutch of
soulless dears—
His soul-case ought to wander through an aeon of
hungry years !
vie.
FRANK HENTY.
Defeat.
Oh Tambo ! Tambo ! Call me back !
The city ways are full,
And I am longing for the track
That leads to one far pool —
One sleeping pool where Memory,
My river-maiden, dwells;
Surrounded by the majesty
Of mountain sentinels.
I see the glitter of the town ;
Oh ! for the stars a-shine —
The eyes of Ood, reflected, down
Deep in that vale of thine ;
Oh ! for the slow, soft-footed moon,
Flooding the spurs with light,
Walking the waves with silver shoon
In Tambo stream to-night.
Perchance Linnette is standing now
Watching thy waters rise,
The gold hair kissing her low brow
And her brown, love-lit eyes.
Oh ! tell her, Tambo, wistfully,
In tender undertone,
My love is all the soul of me,
Her love is all I own ;
For but a city wanderer
The city streets I tread ;
Who came to win a place for her
Has found despair instead.
Then, low, from where the fording track
Thy mountain waters part,
Oh Tambo ! Tambo ! Call me back !
Call me—and break my heart.

THE DREAM OF NEUTRALITY.
Melbourne, Sunday.
A motion was brought before the Trades Hall Council
by a member of the Bakers’ Union. He moved :
“ That this Council, with the Labor members of both
Parliaments, wait on the Prime Minister, Mr. Dkakin, to
ask him if his Government would request the British
Government to secure an agreement with, and the co-
operation of, the Powers to recognise the Australasian
territories as non-belligerent; and that matters of differ-
ence between these territories and the Powers be settled
by a joint conference of the parties concerned, with an
independent chairman as arbitrator ; the Prime Minister
to solicit Maoriland and Fiji to co-operate in approaching'
the Home Government.” —News item.
He that hath no sword, let him sell his garment and
buy one. —The Lord, Luke 22, Verse 36.
There is something pathetic about the belief
which the Australian anti-Defence party, or a
section of it, has in paper promises, and parch-
ment assurances, and treaties, and protocols, and
agreements, as a means of enabling Australia to
avoid carrying its share of the burden of defence.
Like the person who seeks for the Elixir of Life, in
order that he may be the one individual
amid all humanity who dodges the inevitable
grave, so does the anti-Defence crowd babble
of ways whereby we may be the only people
on earth who don’t need tq fear war,
or to prepare against aggression. There is a
strange and lamentable craving for an appeal to
the Hague Peace Conference—the crowd of mild
old gentlemen, in a sleepy old Dutch city, who
might promise us something or anything, but who
have less power to secure the fulfilment of their
promises than the Arbitration Court now sitting
at Newcastle ; the Arbitration Court has at least
the N.S.W. police force behind it, but the Hague
Conference has nothing at all. There is also
much foolish talk of arbitration as a means of
settling international differences, and as a way
whereby Australia may save the cost of defence ;
quite regardless of the fact that arbitration is of
no use unless both parties are willing to
arbitrate. And if the question which brings
trouble to our door is the demand of, say,
a resuscitated China that its subjects shall
be admitted freely into Australia—as many
millions of them as care to come we
simply can’t arbitrate lest the decision should
be given against us and Australia be blotted out
from among the white nations of the earth. Even
if we did take our lives in our hands, and allow
the question of national existence or national
suicide to go to arbitration, and the decision was
given in our favor —well, the chances are that the
other party would obey the award for j ust as long
as was required to get together sufficient forces to
break it. When the party that loses the arbitra-
tion turns nasty the only thing the other party
can do is to fight—or else ask its enemy to arbi-
trate some more.
* * * *
The dream that Australia may be made neutral
territory has also lieen frequently expounded by
the visionaries who think there is some royal road
to cheap security—even as the seekers after the
Philosopher’s Stone fancied there was some way to
instantaneous wealth, and another crowd imagined
that unbounded wisdom might be acquired
if the student buried himself in intense
contemplation of his own navel. And if
the matter was put affably before the
Great Powers of the world, they might declare
Australia neutral territory, as suggested. Ex-
perience has shown that the Great Powers are a
polite lot, who, if they are properly approached,
will declare, on paper, almost anything that costs
them nothing. They have made Switzerland and
Belgium neutral territory, but Switzerland and
Belgium have “ been there”; therefore Belgium
has nearly 200,000 trained men and a conscription
law behind them; and Switzerland trains every
able-bodied man to the use of arms, in case of
need. They know that almost any place can be
made neutral, and almost any country can have
the integrity of its territories guaranteed, and
almost anybody can, in theory, getany thing of that
sort for the asking, if it asks with a fair amount
of diplomacy ; and they also know the value of it
all. Unfortunately, the kind of guarantee that
Belgium and Switzerland enjoy would leave Aus-
tralia just about where it is. If Asia
took advantage of a favorable opportunity
and fell upon neutralised Australia, the
Powers which had agreed to regard it
as neutral soil might be somewhat annoyed. But
to be annoyed is one thing, and to vote £50,000,000
of their taxpayers’ hard-earned money for the
rescue of a country which wouldn’t help to rescue
itself, and to risk their fleets and legions to help
a country which wouldn’t help itself, are quite
another set of circumstances. There is no perma-
nent sympathy in this world for the country
which won’t help itself. And if Australia was
made neutral territory in anything more than a
paper sense, the only result would be that its
legislative independence would be completely
gone. If a territory is neutralised, that only
means that certain Powers undertake to go to war
with anybody who invades the said territory.
If these Powers give their guarantee in real
earnest, they naturally expect two things in
return. One is that the country they are pledged
to defend will contribute to its own defence to
something like the same extent that they con-
tribute to theirs ; in other words, if France or
Germany, which maintain great navies and make
every male citizen do military service, were to
guarantee the neutrality of Australia in any
serious fashion, they would naturally expect Aus-
tralia to likewise train its citizens and to main-
tain a fleet proportioned to its resources, and thus
contribute to its own security ; and when they
came to the defence of our neutrality they might
even expect the Australian fleet and army to be
put under their command. And the other
condition that they would demand would natur-
ally be a voice—and a very loud voice—in the
settlement of Australia’s external policy. If the
White Australia ideal was calculated to make
Japan or China commit a very serious breach of
Australia’s neutrality, and if France or Germany
or the United States was pledged, by agreement
with Britain, to waste its money, its fleet and its
array in defence of Australia’s neutrality, the
guaranteeing Power would naturally expect to be
consulted as to the continuance of the White Aus-
tralia policy. And the chances are that it would
give us notice to abandon the White Australia
policy, failing which it would withdraw from the
guarantee and let Australia’s neutrality go to the
Devil—if there is a Devil. On top of these things
it might even expect Australia to help it with all
this country’s available forces when it struck
trouble. One good turn deserves another.
* * * *
When a big State guarantees the neutrality of
another in any serious fashion it does it for value
received. The neutrality of Belgium is fairly safe
because France reckons it can’t afford to let
Germany have Belgium, and Germany believes it
can’t afford to let France have it, and Britain likes
to have a weak State with no navy right up against
its coast, instead of a strong State with a big navy.
The neutrality of Switzerland is pretty safe,
because Switzerland is in itself a second-rate
Power, which, single-handed, threatens no serious
danger to its big neighbors ; yet, while it exists,
France can’t invade Austria, nor Austria invade
France, nor Germany break in on Italy, nor Italy
on Germany, without some 300,000 good Swiss
troops rising, rifle in hand, to ask the reason why.
If there were no Swiss army, of course Switzer-
land’s neutrality wouldn’t be worth a copper;
France and Austria, or Germany and Italy, might
just as well be right up against each other as have
between them a small bit of ground that would
merely supply a little healthy walking exercise
to their armies before the battle. But it
is really of no immediate visible im-
portance to France, Germany, Austria, or
Italy, and not of very much to Russia or the
United States, whether the Chinese or Japanese
take Australia or not. And the nations that
know what war is like—that know the bloodshed,
and the bill, and the horror, and the suspense—
don’t give any real guarantee of the safety and
neutrality of lazy, loafing communities in which
they are not greatly interested. Such things are
not done as a mere joke or matter of course. The
Great Powers preserve their own safety by huge
toil and expense, and if a lotus-eating community
10,000 miles away asks them to provide also for
its safety, merely because it is too happy and
comfortable to hump its own burden, they
naturally ask “Whaffor?” It would be such a
gigantic case of beggary that any nation, having
such a proposition put before it, would natur-
ally ask “Whaffor?” If Australia was an
independent State, and prepared to guaran-
tee, with a solid fleet and army, the integ-
rity of Java, New Caledonia, Tonquin, and
Dutch and German Papua against Asiatic in-
vasion, then it is possible that Holland, France,
and Germany -would be willing in return to
guarantee the safety of Australia in more than a
paper sense. But to give something for nothing is
quite a different matter.
* * « *
There is no way to safety except the old-
fashioned way of helping ourselves. Even
the presumed guarantee of Britain is worth
little unless we help ourselves. The only
matter on which trouble seems likely to arise with
Asia is the White Australia policy, and with that
ideal— the one ideal that Australia can never give
up—Britain makes no pretence of sympathy.
When there are signs, that it is liable to bring
about serious trouble, the question that Bull will
naturally ask is: “How many men and how
many ships do you back this ideal with, seeing
that it is your ideal—not mine? ” If there are no
men worth speaking of. a*nd no ships worth men-
tioning, Bull will probably consider it cheaper to
abolish our ideal than fight for it. At the bitter
end every country has to rely on its
resources. It can get friends to assist it it it ia
forces of its own with which it can assist tnem
when their necessity conies. It can get otner
nations to fight for its ideals if it is willing and
able to help them to fight for their ideals when
they require aid. But a community which pi op-
poses that other nations should help it when 1
won’t either help them in return or even help
itself, is only a jest, and a poor one at that.
THE SMUGGLED CHINAMAN.
That ever-yellow pest, the Chow, is still dribbling
in illicit fashion into Australia, and the Common-
wealth's External Affairs Department is forced to
admit that the Mongol is too clever to be caught
by ordinary means. The method employed to
find the stowaway Chows —they are like vermin
and can hide in any old crack in a ship s deck is
too heavy and methodical, and that is the whole
trouble. When the report was first made to
Prime Minister Deakin, proving up to the hilt
previous statements regarding the influx of
smuggled Chinese, instructions were issued by
Alfred that all vessels were to be “exhaust-
ively ” searched. He didn’t wait to explain
what that meant, so the vessels were exhaustively
searched. The Customs folk have hired ships
carpenters, and at Port Darwin and the Queens-
land ports of call —whichever a ship reaches first
the ship’s carpenter and the Customs officer go
all over each vessel and test it for false
floors and roofs and bulkheads. It takes them
from 30 to 45 minutes to turn a whole mail steamer
inside out in this fashion—so the thoroughness of
the job may be estimated. These anxious
searchers have never yet found a stowaway Chow,
and only two conclusions are possible —either
there are no Chows coming in, or the Common-
wealth officers aren’t swift enough to catch them.
It is difficult to believe that the stream of Chows —
20 and 30 per mail steamer —who were being smug-
gled into Australia have been suddenly turned off
because the Government received proof of what it
had suspected for years. But, apart from this
deductive reasoning, there is the cold, ha,rd fact
that, since the Customs and External Affairs were
put on the qui vive by the special officers’ report,
new-chum Chows have been landed from nearly
every mail steamer. In many cases the Depart-
ment has been warned from Hong Kong and from
Sydney that a clutch of stowaways was aboard
certain steamers. And the Chows were there ;
but they were not found. Atlee Hunt, Secre-
tary for External Affairs, sorrowfully wags his
head and admits that the Chows are beating him.
He has suggested a way out; but the Government
is slow to act, and in the meantime the Chows
come in.
* • • *
A little while ago a steamer, alleged to be carry-
ing 15 Chinese stowaways, was quarantined in
Sydney. It was searched over and over again.
Then it was fumigated, with a profound hope that
no Chinaman had been overlooked and would die
by the process. No Chinaman died. In fact,
nothing happened, and the Customs people
scratched their heads hard and wondered if their
information was correct. The External Affairs
Department has since found that it was, but the
Chinese went ashore at a northern port where no-
body expected them. It is not pleasant to reflect on
officials ; but it is a fairly obvious fact that a
searcher, or whatever he may be called, who re-
ceives the princely salary of about £4 a week, is laid
open to serious temptation when he is asked to
discover Mongol stowaways, whose cash value to
their consignee is somewhere in the neighborhood
of £5O each. It. is easy to see how the consignee
could spare £lOO on each shipment to square the
watchers. It may not be done. The watchers
may be the straightest, most honest men in the
Commonwealth; but, anyhow, they don’t find the
Chows. Alfred Deakin must decide that
drastic measures are to be taken. Talk of rewards
and searchings is just so much hot air. Atlee
Hunt has already suggested the patrolling of the
run between here and Hongkong by keen
detectives. That should be done, and a cap-
able officer should also be sent to Hongkong.
If the White Australia policy is worth anything,
it is worth a decent effort to preserve. Its pre-
servation may cost something, but it is worth that
something. With a keen officer in Hong Kong,
and a smart detective accompanying each boat—
both officers placed above temptation and chosen
for their absolute reliability—the secrets of the
“ trade” ought to be easily detected. But, as an
anticipatory measure, Alfred Deakin should run
through a little amending Act making the smug-
gling in of Chinese an offence with a good, thick
deterrent penalty—say three years’ gaol or more as
a minimum for a first offence. Further, every Chow
in the Commonwealth should be compelled to
register himself on the finger-print system. If an
unregistered Chow were found meandering about
he could then be hove out at the back window.
There seems no reason why Alfred Deakin
should not apply both these remedies, and so
make fairly certain of a cure.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Federal Fair Dealing.
George Reid hired a small and rather obscure
Sydney hall one night last week, and the small
crowd that still follows his faded banner went
there and partly filled the small premises.
And to this small crowd G. Reid had the stu-
pendous impudence todiscourse about the necessity
for political honor and the strict observance, “not
of the letter only, but of the spirit of the bargain
made between the six Federal States ” (cheers)
He is also reported to have said that “they would
never breathe into Federation a soul unless it was
a soul of political honor.” Under these circum-
stances, it should be safe to assume that Reid will
leave off breathing when he enters the Federal
arena, and won’t resume till he gets away ao- a in
Whatever he may be able to breathe into the
Commonwealth, it can’t be honor. A flavor of
cigars is not possible, for G. Reid doesn’t
smoke, but one of peppermints doesn’t seem
improbable; anyhow, honor should be out
of the breathing radius. The record of
G. Reid’s connection with Federal affairs
has been one of political unreliability, dishonor
fraud, wriggling and all manner of shady devices’
He has been the blot the shame and the disgrace
of the Federation. It was he who invited the
other States to join in a union, and pledged his
political “ honor ’’ that the Federal Constitution
would be accepted in N.S.W. if it got a majority
xn nn°e eS ’ff nd pr ™ d , ed U ! at majority included
50,000 suffrages. When the anti-Federalists in
the N.S.W. Assembly proposed to break faith and
raise the necessary affirm..tivo vote to 80 000 he
voted first against the wretched act of treachery
mid 1.1011 for it. He could have prevented the
Assembly holding up N.S.W. to public scorn
as the one State that couldnt keep faith, by
rallying the Government majority against the
proposal, but, being a mere political trickster and
adventurer, he made no attempt to do anything
of the kind. Later, he left the Convention, appa-
rently satisfied with the draft Constitution. He
was billed to address a great public meeting—as
everybody understood, in support of the proposed
Constitution- He did his famous somersault act
once more, and declared against it, chiefly on
account of the Braddon clause ; and by constant
and energetic denunciation of the allegedly
ruinous nature of the BRADDON clause, he
did his share to prevent the 80,000 affirm-
ative minimum being reached. ihen, like
any other person whose political honor was
for sale, he intimated to the other States the price
at which he would again turn his political coat. It
proved at this juncture that the sine qua non was
not the abolition of the Braddon clause, as his
speeches had led most people to suppose; his
political crookedness was such that he had even
turned traitor under bogus pretences, and had
got a large section of the N.S.W. people to
vote against the Constitution Bill for sham
reasons. Reid’s price was the promise of the
capital for N.S.W., and he got it on the
terms set forth in clause 125. This new departure
reduced the situation to one of plain bribery.
When Reid was inciting the people of N.S.W,
against the Federal draft constitution, on the
ground that the Braddon clause was an ill.
devised idea, he professed to be considering the
interests of Australia. When he shifted his posi-
tion, and declared that the possession of the
capital was the only price at which N.S.W. would
stick to its own movement, he put the oldest State
of Australia in the position of a mere black-
mailer and collector of backsheesh. Anyhow,
having carried his point he intimated to the
public that this time there would be no 80,000
minimum, whereby he demonstrated that he could,
by reason of the Government majority in the
Assembly, have prevented the original breach of
faith, and that he had wallowed in the mud of
political dishonor, not under compulsion but be-
cause the mud was his natural element. And this
political creature, of all the people in the Common-
wealth, has the “ front ” to get a small audience to-
gether in an obscure hall that he may address
it on the necessity for honorable dealing in
Federal matters. It is humorous. The spectacle
of Satan taking up a collection towards the con-
version of the heathen would be a mere circum-
stance by comparison. The only way in which
N.S.W. can declare its attachment to political
honor and fair-dealing is by declaring George
Reid a political outcast, and unfit to hold even
the job of alderman.
More Stinking Myth.
The latest conspicuous member of the Stinking
Myth party is a woman, or alleged female, who
recently wrote over the signature of “Femina’’
to the Launceston (Tas.) Examiner on the
“Treatment of Chinese.” Her yarn was as
follows:
I would like to draw the attention of all humane people
to an action of the Federal Government on which I saw
some comments in last week’s Australasian. It seems
that to make quite sure that an odd Chinaman or so is not
making his way into Australia as a stowaway, the head of
the Customs has ordered some ships from China to be not
only searched but fumigated. As after this process no
dead Chinese were found, he has the satisfaction of being
able to assure us that there were none aboard those
particular ships. But suppose a dead Chinaman had
been found, as the Australasian says (I find it hard
to believe), two were after a similar proceeding some
years ago in Westralia, would not a charge of mur-
der, or at least aggravated manslaughter, lie against
whoever was responsible for such orders?
I do not know that I am a particularly soft-hearted
person, and I certainly am not fond of Chinese ; but the
callous cruelty of our rulers fills me with such indigna-
tion as I cannot find words to express, so I will leave the
bald statement of FACTS, hoping, however, that you,
sir, who have so often shown yourself the fearless cham-
pion of right, will use your able pen to denounce this
abomination.
It is a matter of fairly well-known fact that ships
are fumigated as a guarantee against the spread
of disease. Ships from Asiatic ports are fumi-
gated pretty often, simply because Asiatic ports
are woefully dirty and full of disease. The vessel
that comes from China is first searched for Chinese
stowaways. The orders of Prime Minister
Deakin are that it is to be “exhaustively
searched.” As a rule, no Chow stowaways are
found. If there are any on board they refuse to
appear, despite the most earnest appeals to come
out and pass the Education Test. Everybody on
board professes to be sure that there are no illicit
heathen on the ship. Then, if there is reason to
suspect plague, etc., on board, the vessel is fumi-
gated. , Australia can’t take the risk of being
ravaged by epidemics, on the remote off-chance
that a Chinese criminal may be suffocated in the
course of the necessary precautions, any more than
iasmania can afford to disband its police force for
fear some member of it may one day injure, or
even kill, a burglar in the course of his business.
Nevertheless, out of this obvious proposition
there appears the beginnings of a new lie and
slander to the effect that Chinese stowaways
are habitually suffocated by order of Prime
Minister Leakin, and their bodies thrown over-
board, or something like that. A horrible
female, or alleged female, begins the tale of
murder with a vague legend about two Chinamen
who, were found dead in Westralia “some years
ago. ~ She says she finds the story “ hard to be-
lieve, but all the same she describes it as “fact”
and an abomination, ’ and whoops about “the
callous cruelty of our rulers,” and performs in a
manner that implies that two alleged Chows were
deliberately slain. An unpatriotic newspaper
gives space to her tale, and without protest allows
her to appeal to it to expose these ghastly pro-
ceedings. The chances are that the yellow
journalist abroad will do the rest. And in
all probability the Tasmanian female retires
to the bosom of her family with a con-
viction that, by accusing the Australian Gov-
ernment, on evidence which she herself admits
sue finds hard to believe, of deliberate murder,
she has done her duty as a sincere and horrible
Christian.

G. Reid’s Inveterate Yes-No.
G. Reid s Yes-No is such an inveterate habit that
it is a matter of mystery as to how he ever
developed his more than comfortable physical
proportions. Surely as a youth, when he was
asked to have pie, he often unconsciously said
Yes-No, and surely thus he missed a good deal of
pie. Perhaps,.though, he saved loss by having
strictly affirmative and acquisitive hands which
always grabbed anything good that was going,
whatever his tongue said. That was, at any rate,
the case in regard to the increased Federal Parlia-
mentary allowance. When the Bill for the in-
crease was before the House G. Reid was most
emphatic in saying “No ” :
Personally I attend so irregularly that, under no cir-
cumstances, would I accept the proposed increase. I
intend, therefore, to repay the money to the Treasury,


because it seems to me that no other method of dealing
with it would be complete.— Hansard, 17/8/ 07.
That was G. Reid’s “No.” Now (6/3/’08) a
return has been published showing that eight
inemtfjrs of the Australian Parliament refuse to
take the added allowance. But G. Reid’s name is
not ajpong them. Apparently he pockets the in-
crease with the sensible majority. That isG. Reid’s
“Yes.” There would be really nothing to remark
in the incident —we all expect Mr. Reid to do
this sort of thing—were it not for the fact that
the gentleman has (The Bulletin is informed)
lodged with the Treasury a letter explaining
the “reason” of his No-Yes. His nerve
surely must be failing. These little things are
best done cynically. “Explanations” can have
no other effect than to make the explainer
ludicrous.

Canberra, in the Dry Country.
Australia suffers most of the time, and over
most of its area, from one great drawback—it is a
dry country. There are some parts of it, such as
the North Queensland coastal districts, where
drought never happens ; but the bulk of the con-
tinent is liable to be dry at any moment. New
South Wales, though far from being the worst
portion of temperate Australia, is liable to be
drier than any rational
human being would
desire, and as the
Federal Constitution
Was artfully “faked”
to provide that the
Australian capital must
be in New South Wales,
it is most important to
sfelect a Federal terri-
tory in a part of the
State which has either
a good rainfall of its
own or is blessed with
a big, wet, constant,
reliable river that rolls
down from another part
of the country where
the rain is steady and
reliable. It is this
aspect of the case
which creates the im-
pression that, when the
N.S.W. State Govern-
ment—a Government
that is always denoun-
cing the Common-
wealth and clamoring
like an old cow-bell
about “State Rights”
—commenced to advo-
cate Canberra as a
Federal city site, it was
inspired chiefly by the
utter wretchedness of
the place. Canberra is
so completely wretched
that a Federal capital
built there must al-
ways be a small, hopeless place, overshadowed
by even the most second-rate of the State
capitals; and to a Government which has for
its greatest ambition the degradation and
discrediting of Federated Australia this was
doubtless a recommendation of no ordinary kind.
In Australia no town or city which hasn’t a
good water supply has a chance of greatness,
and the table of' rainfalls which follows gives
a fair estimate of Canberra s chance of becoming
great. Canberra, it must be remembered, has no
river, but only a little local creek ; therefore its
hopes must be judged by the local rainfall, which
is recorded at the nearest observing station,
Queanbeyan, nine miles away. Dalgety, on the
other hand, has a big, ever-flowing river, supply-
ing almost unlimited water for drinking purposes,
for irrigation, and for lighting, heating, and
machine power. This river comes down from the
mountain country round Kiandra. lherefore,
Dalgety’s prospects as a Federal capital can be
fairly gauged by the rainfall at Kiandra, just as
Canberra’s little show can be estimated to a
reasonable extent by the moisture at Queanbeyan.
The following list (from Fart IV. of the N.f>. VV.
Statistical Register for 1905) shows the average
moisture that dropped from Heaven during a

There are some interesting inferences to be drawn
from these figures. The Australian Parliament
selected for a Federal capital a site which, though
its own rainfall isn’t extraordinary, collects to
itself, by reason of its splendid river, the waters
of a district which has the second biggest rainfall
in N.S.W. Wade’s State Government, in the
immensity of its cussedness, replied by ottering
a district which has no big river, which depenc s ou
its local rainfall, and which ranks 66th in poin o
moisture. There are only 19 worse spots to e
found, so far as the meteorological records go, in
all the 310,700 square miles which make up INew
South Wales. That is to say. there are 05 places
on the N.S.W. meteorological records with a
better rainfall, six with a rainfall as good, an
only 19 places with a worse record, and as regarc s
four of them, it is only one inch of rain per
annum worse. Even a man with the bitterest
desire to plant the Australian capital m the worst
possible spot would hardly have the front to re-
commend Wenindie, on the Darling, where there
are nine inches of rain per annum ; but as tar as
he could go without being utterly ridiculous,
State Premier Wade seems to have gone when he
recommended Canberra.
The Eternal State Insect.
Many N. S. Wales (and Australian) citizens
refuse to take The Bulletin’s view of the danger
of allowing the Federal capital area to be entirely
surrounded by the territory of any one State,
without means of access to the ocean, or to other
States. “Granted,” they say, “ that Carruthers
was an Insect, that Wade is a Microbe, we are
not always going to have that sort of State Pre-
mier. It is extravagance to imagine that a N.S.W.
Premier—except, perhaps, he be one of those two
gentlemen—would attempt to interfere with the
road or railway access to the Australian capital,
or to refuse it a clean, adequate water supply.”
That is all very well, but as of three Premiers and
a stop-gap since Federation, two have been anti-
Federal insects, the presumption of future sensi-
ble Premiers isn’t supported by the figures. And
it is essentially against the reason of things. The
temptation will always be for the State Pre-
mier to become an Insect towards the Feder-
ation. He will, as often as not, be a disap-
pointed aspirant for a place in the Aus-
tralian Parliament. He will always be tempted
to feel annoyed at the superior Parliament
above him, and to attempt to “show off” at its
expense when opportunity offers. That is human

for by N.S. W. State Premier Wade.
nature. Whilst the States remain as they are,
the likelihood is that most State Premiers will be
inclined to take up an Insect attitude towards the
union. The Commonwealth must keep that fact
in mind during the Federal capital negotiations.

That Cordite Factory Near Melbourne.
Away back at the tail end of the century before
last, when Germany slept and dreamed under the
rule of its 2000 sovereigns, there was a nice balance
of power and dignity among the States. They
had State Frights badly, and their local dignity
was terrible. There were petty principalities
which were pledged to contribute 50 men to the
imperial force in time of war, and still smaller
States which only sent 40 men, though these
40 had a prescriptive right, conferred by some-
body who had been dead 176 years and three
months, to a more honorable place in the battle
array than the 50—either a place nearer the im-
perial standard, or closer to the canteen, or some-
thing like that. Even in one contingent things
would often be Strangely divided. The corporation
of the city of Gmund had the right to
appoint the captain who was old and fat;
and the Abbot of Gegenbach appointed the ensign,
who was young and drunk; and the Abbess of
Rotenmiinster nominated the lieutenant, who was
beautiful and wore lovely clothes; and the rank
and file were mostly missing, and what weren’t
missing mostly ran away. Tnings like these
THE SNOWY RIVER. FIVE MILES ABOVE D ALGETY.
The Water Supply of the Federal Capital selected by the Australian Parliament.
made Germany so rotten that, even after the
country was invaded, it took the Diet five
months to decide on war, while, as a rule,
it only took the combined forces of the small
States five days or minutes to disperse
from the time they first sighted a live
enemy. But the system preserved State Bights ;
and that old, helpless, ramshackle Germany, that
was like a dead whale on the political waters was
in deadly earpest about its State Rights. J\ow,
in a small way, Australia threatens to follow in
the footsteps of the old German empire, which
burst. This country is going to set up an arms
factory at Lithgow, in N.S.W. The reasons for
selecting Lithgow are plain enough. There is coal
on the spot and iron near at hand ; there are
already ironworks there ; and the place is fairly
accessible and yet far enough from the coast to be
reasonably safe. Lithgow was plainly selected on
its merits. Then, lest Victoria might feel that it
wasn’t getting its fair share of the business, it is
proposed to establish a cordite factory near Mel-
bourne. Cordite can be made in any old place,
and Melbourne is no better or worse fitted for the
work than Morphettville, or McPhillamy’s Cross-
ing. But obviously the stuff that goes into the
cartridge and the shell should be made somewhere
close to where the cartridge and the shell are
made, and that should bar Melbourne and every
other Victorian town. It may be healthy exercise
to drag the cartridges and shells from Lithgow to
Melbourne, or to drag the cordite from Melbourne
to Lithgow, but it is folly, and muddle, and
waste of time and money, and a great sacrifice of
military efficiency. And it isn’t worth the while
of any State to demand the possession of the cor-
dite factory from mercenary motives ; it only
requires about 20 men, working in a few wooden
sheds, to make enough cordite for the Common-
wealth, and no State can get rich on an industry of
that size. Therefore this proposed division of the
arms and ammunition manufacture between two
States is a burnt offering to the State Frights habit,
which hasn’t even a fair-sized cash motive attached
to it. It is a sinful sacrifice of public safety for
the sake of imaginary State dignity. It is only
necessary now that military boots should be made
in North Queensland, and military saddles in
Central Australia, and uniforms in Westralia,
and that the whole lot, when finished, should be
stored in Tasmania, and then the system would
be complete. The cordite idea is beautifully
reminiscent of the disordered army of the Holy
Roman Empire, and the contingent that had its
captain appointed by the corporation of Gmund,
and its ensign by the Abbot of Gegenbach, and
its lieutenant by the old lady who bossed the
Abbey of Rotenmiinster.

The Folly of Being an Able Public Servant.
When Oliver was being forced out of the position
of Chief Railway Commissioner of N. S. Wales
The Bulletin gave the matter an amount of atten-
tion which it would not have called for if it had been
a mere matter of changing one official for another.
But a principle was involved. Oliver had been
a great public servant, and a conspicuously honest
one. In the Lands Department he had shown
resolute courage in cleaning up a scandal (the
memory of that courage must have been a galling
reproach to the Carruthers-Wade crowd). In the
railways he had served the public interest, and
only the public interest, and aroused hatred by
his opposition to “jobs,” about which there were
all sorts of sinister rumors. It was for his courage
and his' devotion to the public good—not for any
incapacity—that Oliver was removed, and his
retirement was a most serious blow at the interests
of the public, since it was necessarily adiscourage-
menttootherpublicservants who might be inclined
to dare the anger of newspapers orpoliticians in the
public interest. Another blow of the same sort
is now struck by the Wade Government in its
changes of personnel on the Harbor Trust and
the Water and Sewerage Board. Two members
of the Harbor Trust are retired to suit the con-
venience of the Government, though their work
has been conspicuously successful. One place is
filled by the transfer to it from the Water and
Sewerage Board of Mr. Keele. That gentleman,
as President of the Water and Sewerage Board,
taking the right view of his responsibilities
as a public servant, has served the public
well, and has not hesitated in doing so to
incur the enmity of Ministers. On several occa-
sions he has stood up against the Government,
and always events have proved that he was right.
Some times he had his way. At other times the
Government —as when it insisted on infecting che
Cataract Dam with thousands of tons of rotten
vegetable matter—won ; but Keele was always
sturdy in protest. Seemingly the Government
dare not sack him. It takes the next worst
course by removing him from a position
where he was doing the best of service to the public,
and finding a place for him elsewhere—where it
hopes he won’t get in its road—and it finds
him that new place by sacking another man
who deserved better fortune. It is an adminis-
trative job of the worst description, and should be
met with a loud protest when Parliament meets.
Concerning Landlords.
A recent issue of the Warrnambool (Vic.)
Standard contained a notice, from a well-known
district landowner, inviting tenders for 14 farms.
The leases of these farms, all occupied, expire in
May, and the successful tenderers will be given
five years’ occupation. This system of leasing
farms by tender is the last iniquity, save one, in
the experience of the tenant farmer. There is
only one stage lower, and that is the letting of
farms at auction, where the miserable farmers bid
against each other, and the rack-renting landlord
gets the last available penny out of them. But the
tender system runs the auction horror fairly close.
The farmer in occupation has a miserable time.
He is haunted by the dread that his neighbor, who
has more grown-up children—which means more
gratis labor—than he has, will slip in a tender at
a higher rate-than he can rightly afford. So
the usual result is that, at each tendering,
the rentssteadily increase. Around Warrnauibool,
as it happens, there is a great, almost fierce,
demand for farms, and the landlord is king of the
position. In many cases the amount he receives
in rent is actually more than he could make off the
land if he worked it himself. The tenant not only
works hard himself, but he sweats his wife and
family ; and in many cases he is contented if, at
the end of the year, he has managed to keep out
of debt. Britain is often held up as a shocking
example of the tenant system, yet over large areas
of Britain the horror of letting by tender or
auction is practically unknown. Sometimes in
Australia the let-by-tender farm is held by fh.e
one man for long terms, but the method by whip))
this is accomplished is a triumph in usury and art-
fulness. When the tenders are in, the landlord goes
to his best tenants and tells them (truthfully or
otherwise) that he has had better offers than theirs
for their farms. Still, he does not wish to part
with them, and, if the old tenants will raise their
tenders to the sums in question, they can keep the
farms. By this villainous scheming the landlord
usually secures, at one and the same time, a good
tenant and an exorbitant rent. This goes on until
the exasperated tenant gives the game best. At
the present time, all over the Western district of
Victoria, there are hundreds of farmers who are
working, from daylight {ill dark, seVen days a
week, just for food and clothes for themselves and
their families. The butter produced as the result
of their labors is bringing high prices both here and
in London, but the whole of the profits are going
to the man who never puts his hand either to
the cow or the plough. There are, of course,
some decent West Victorian landlords, whose
tenants are making a little for themselves;
but the vast bulk are in the position stated.
Yet, so crassly blind to his own interests is the
average farmer, that he shudders when a land-tax
is mentioned ; and he will walk miles, even when
dog-tired after milking, to attend an anti-Sosh
meeting. Even such an impudent and public
exhibition of the landlords’ power as the adver-
tisement referred to rarely excites comment. The
average farmer —at any rate, the old-style man—
seems to regard the landlord as the Act of God,
like the rabbit, the thistles, and the neglected
roads, and as something which has got to be put
up with.

Hercules (Deceased), Widow Hercules, and
the Hercules Orphans.
A pew weeks back The Bulletin referred to a
Geelong wheat lumper, such an exceptionally
strong man as to be locally designated “Her-
cules,” who had strained his heart through carry-
ing the 3GOlb. bags of wheat which the Victorian
farmer sends down, and had died as a consequence.
Last week his widow escorted his two little
orphans to the Geelong police court, and asked
that they be first committed to the indus-
trial schools, and then boarded out to
her, as she, being herself in poor health,
was unable to maintain then.. Practically,
she asked the State to maintain them and leave
them in her care. The Law, in the person of a
kindly P.M., was disposed to grant her request,
but found itself unable to do so, for the simple
reason that Mrs. Hercules had looked after her
childrentoowell —they were not “neglected.” Had
she been a careless, shiftless mother the State
would have cared for the orphans, though it
might not have boarded them out to her; but
being a good mother with a tender regard for her
little ones, the fool Law could give her no
assistance. So the father of those babies
killed himself through trying to do more than

side the pale of State help through also doing her
duty by her children. The P.M. showed what he
thought of the merits of her case by handing her a
sovereign from his pocket, and suggesting that
the police might do something to assist her. But
The Bulletin has an idea that there is a much
louder call for the Victorian farmers to assist the
widow Hercules. This is a case where these
same farmers, who are themselves whales for
State help, might send their heaviest bags of
wheat —even up to 6001 b.—to the Geelong police
for the widow Hercules. Certainly this paper
doesn’t want any more lumpers to kill themselves
carrying any such bags to that fatherless home.
Still it wants to see the bags arrive.
The Liverpool (N.S.W.) Tubercle Farm.
It is announced in the daily press :
Some differences of opinion have at times arisen
between Mr. Brodie, Inspector-General of Charities, and
Dr. Beattie, medical superintendent of the Liverpool
Asylum, in connection with their administrative work.
These differences, the Chief Secretary, Mr. Wood, states,
are not of recent date. It has been deemed advisable
that the Public Service Board should investigate the
matter. This work will shortly be undertaken by the
Board.
As to what those “ differences of opinion ” are,
this letter, from an inmate of Liverpool Asylum,
will give some hint
For years past the Medical Officer has been calling suc-
cessive Governments’ attention to the overcrowded state
of the Hospital, but to no purpose. The only response
has been a complaint that the cost of maintenance was
excessive. When the present Inspector-General of
Charities was appointed, his first action was to request
the Medical Superintendent to reduce the diet, and he
brought an array of figures to show what was done in
other hospitals. Then a duel began, and continues to
the present moment, Mr. Brodie contending the con-
sumptives are over-fed, Dr. Beattie insisting that they
require a liberal diet. The patients used to be allowed to
walk about the surrounding country for fresh air and
exercise. When the new official came into power, he
framed a regulation that consumptives were to be allowed
out of the four walls for exercise two hours at a time
once a fortnight only. The Chief Secretary was appealed
to, and he upset the regulation. From that time small
privileges enjoyed for years have, one after another, been
withdrawn. For years a horse and waggonette were kept
to give patients (whether consumptive or otherwise) who
could not walk a couple of hours’drive in the fresh air. Now
the horse and vehicle have been sent away to Parramatta.
Notifications from the Inspector-General of Charities to
the Medical Superintendent constantly state that so many
eggs and so niany tins of jam, etc., have been issued, and
request a curtailment. That the diet scale has not been
much more reduced than at present is solely due to Dr.
Beattie, whose sympathy is with the patients.
The complaints of institution inmates can be
always discounted to some extent. Naturally,
inmates are inclined to be querulous, and to see
tyranny in harmless acts of administration. But,
allowing for all that, there is no doubt that under
the new charities regime the lot of the Liverpool
Asylum inmates, ghastly and miserable at the
best, has been made worse. A few pounds have
been saved at the expense of the little shreds of
happiness left to the old men dying of terrible
diseases. It is a sad form of economy. As regards
many of the patients at Liverpool—the consump-
tives—the State is engaged in killing them off
quietly and expeditiously, so as to relieve the
community of danger from infection. A niggardly
attitude towards those condemned to death is
simply despicable.

A Nation Between the Devil and the Deep
Sea.
“ Shimbun ” writes from Japan :
Since the muzzling of the foreign press in Korea it is
very difficult to find out just what is going on in that
country, but we are assured that the accustomed horrors
continue, as accounts of them are leaking out through
missionaries and others travelling through the de-
cimated regions. After the famous edict issued by
General Hasbgawa, threatening with severe penalties ail
inhabitants who aided or abetted the insurgents, matters
became much worse, and some of the atrocities committed
are beyond description. The Koreans are now between
the devil and the deep sea ; the native rebels on the one
side and the Japanese soldiery on the other. If the in-
habitants refuse food and shelter to the rebels, as the
Japanese authorities insist on their doing, they will be
killed and the necessaries taken by force, and then,
because the insurgents have been able to get food and
shelter in that village, the Japanese come along and
destroy the place for permitting the possibility. As death
appears certain in any case, most of the Koreans prefer
to sacrifice themselves by assisting the rebels, with whom
most of the population is in hearty sympathy, rather
than to die without having done anything of a patriotic
nature..
Those most recently passing through the affected parts
report that the country for long distances reveals
only desolation. The Japanese policy of extermination,
often including whole villages, seems everywhere appar-
ent. In some instances the Japanese methods of
suppression are as cruel as anything reported from
Armenia or the Congo. Christian churches are burnt,
and the Bibles and hymnbooks made into bonfires out-
side the places of worship. Innocent men are ruthlessly
put to death without examination. In one case the
Christians w-ere assembled for worship when the Japanese
arrived. Because it happened to be a village from which
the insurgents were suspected of having taken food, the
Japanese burst into the church, took out the minister
and chief officers, and shot them on the spot without any
trial or inquiry. This is as unjust as it is cruel, in face of
the fact that the Korean Christians have everywhere
tried to keep their excited compatriots within the limits
of the law, advising patience and forbearance in spite of
intolerable provocation. Indeed.it has been in the northern
districts, where Christianity mostly prevails, that there
has been very little insurrection. The Korean has proved
himself even more amenable to the altruistic precepts of
Christianity than his Chinese or Japanese brother; and
there is no doubt that by kindness and fair dealing the
Japanese could do much to conciliate the Koreans.
This attitude, however, can hardly be expected so long
as those engaged in suppressing the disaffection are, in
intelligence and humaneness, far below the people they
are attempting to govern. The average Japanese in
Korea, whether soldier or civilian, is certainly not above
those he would peremptorily subdue. Foreigners that
have lived long in both Japan and Korea assert the
undoubted conviction that the Korean is in no way
inferior to the Japanese; and they sav that, given the
same opportunity, the Korean will surpass the Japanese as
a man. This is not surprising when we remember that
Korea is the source of Japan’s civilisation, art and
literature.
Nor do foreigners in Korea find themselves more
immune than the natives from Japanese injustice and
insolence. When Bishop Harris, of the Methodist
Church, was going through Korea some time ago, he was
very roughly treated by Japanese coolies, and rescued
only with some effort. Recently two Englishmen were
passing through the city gate in Seoul, on their way home
from the Olub. They were rudely stopped by the
Japanese sentry at the point of a fixed bayonet. As it
was only 7.30 p.m. they protested at this treatment; and,
attempting to go on, they were attacked by the sentry,
and one of them received a severe bayonet wound.
These instances, however, are mere scratches on pro-
priety compared with the ills inflicted on the individual
Korean. Once when the villagers followed the Japanese
soldiers who were taking the headmen of the
town to prison, they' were ordered back by
the Japanese. Because they did not go, they
were at once set upon by the soldiers, with the result
that one Korean had his head split open, another one his
ear cut off, another his arm badly slashed, and many
others were wounded. This cruelty caused that whole
village to rise in revenge, and the Japanese were soon put
to rout. The next day the Japanese came back with
reinforcements, surrounded that village, drove the people
in from the fields, planted artillery on the hills, and
cannonaded the place, killing men, women and children
alike. In An Sung district, a few weeks ago, a prominent
Korean named Hong Chang Dook was taken out and shot
without any attempt to prove him guilty of offence. Mr.
Hong, who was a wealthy man with property in Seoul,
was on his way to his country estate, and was taking his
dinner at an inn when arrested and murdered by the
Japanese. Those who know Mr. Hong declare that he
was one of the most respected of Korean gentlemen, and
never known to harbor insurgents or to incite rebellion.
Taking these casual Incidents as examples of the
methods Japan is using to subjugate Korea, w’e cannot
wonder that the whole nation is up in arms, and that the
most sanguine of the Japanese authorities prophesy that
it will be three or more years before there can be any pro-
spects of peacein Korea. Even Japan’s own soldiers, fight-
ing her cause in Formosa, have recently mutinied, and
massacred every representative of the army insight. At
the present moment Korea is endeavoring to accomplish
a similar feat of revenge for cruelty inflicted. The
Korean organisation, known as the Righteous Army,
is now massing in the interior with the inten-
tion of marching on Seoul to kill the Japanese
and all who approve of them. The best authority
states that the number of the recruits is about
10,000, and that these are being added to daily. These
thousands of young Korean patriots probably know only
too well that in approaching Seoul they are marching to
certain death, but they have made up their minds that,
as they will be butchered in any case, they would
sooner die in a brave attempt to rescue their deposed and
imprisoned king than die as cowards fleeing from
the oppressor. Yet the Japanese say the Koreans have
no patriotism. What nation for its size ever showed a
greater number willing to die in what was deemed a just
yet hopeless cause ? What heroes those Koreans would
make were their zeal and courage but under intelligent
direction with all the advantages of modern education 1

An Unexpected Friend.
A LITTLE while ago the financial column of Sydney
Telegraph contained this item :
With the general expectation that the Federal Parlia-
ment will be asked at an early date to consolidate the
banking laws and procedure of the various States on a
common footing, the experiences of other countries will
be carefully examined. Perhaps the most recent addition
to the modern banking fraternity is Japan. To a certain
extent the latter accepted the United States as a guide—
that is, as far as the private banks are concerned. These
institutions are termed “National Banks.” The Govern-
ment makes the note issue through the Treasury depart-
ment, each bank receiving State notes for its own issue,
against which Government bonds have to be given. In
addition, each bank is bound to keep 80 per cent, of its
capital in Government bonds At, the market value as the
security for an equal amount of notes which it is allowed
to issue, and the remaining %0 per cent, in Government
notes or legal tender to provide for the redemption of its
notes. The Canadian Act, in addition to making notes a
first charge upon a bank’s assets, compels every institu-
tion to hold 40 per cent, of its cash reserves in Dominion
notes. This naturally greatly profits the State, BUT IT
ENHANCES THE SECURITY INSTEAD OF DEPRECI-
ATING THE VALUE OF THE ISSUE.
The Bulletin draws public attention to these
rather belated but still welcome utterances. It is
a dozen years or so s.nce this paper began to advo-
cate the adoption in Australia of the Canadian
banking system, with its Government note issue
and all the other paraphernalia, and it
has continued its advocacy ever since. It
urged that the fund thus placed at the
Government’s disposal should be applied (1)
as a gold reserve against the note issue; (2) to
establish a sinking fund for the repayment of the
State debts; and possibly, to a smaller extent, (3)
towards the establishment of a Federal capital.
The idea met the enthusiastic denunciation of the
great bulk of the Tory press, and such remarkable
documents as Palmer and Sons’ share circular
(issued in Sydney) viewed it with horror (when J.
C. Watson became one of its advocates), as “con-
fiscation,” or something like that. The steady
policy of the Tory press was to ignore the
fact that the system had been tried for
many years in a steady-going British
community, and had proved eminently suc-
cessful ; and to treat it as the wild, unkempt
dream of some Australian wharf-lumper or
Domain orator. In Canada the Conservative
party took up the idea ; therefore, if the S. M.
Herald had been in Canada it would probably
have regarded it with approval. In Australia it
happened to be the Democratic party and the
Democratic press which took it up, therefore it
became accursed. But the idea continued to make
headway by reason of its obvious merits, and now
the Telegraph is also among the prophets.
The Victorian Closer Settlement Joke.
Dearß.—Although it is a farce to the outsider, the
management, or mismanagement, of the Victorian
Closer Settlement areas is a tragedy to the poor
wretches who are most interested. I don’t know
why theatrical managers stage wretched shows
about “ Dured to London,” when there are much
more ghastly tragedies being enacted every day
with the unfortunate settlers who were “Lured
on to the Land.” Take the case of Wyuna, on
the Goulburn, the first of the northern Vic.
estates to be resumed. The Board, wishing to
avoid the appearance of meanness, gave the
owners £2 per acre or so more than the
land was really worth. After the deal the
Board was so filled with pride in what it had
acquired that it kept the property lying idle for a
couple of years and spent its time admiring the
green grass and the accumulation of nice fresh
interest. Then it got a move on, and painted the
place in such glowing colors as to suggest that
some bright imaginative writer of fairy stories had
been on the job. The soil would grow anything,
the estate was commanded by the Goulburn, and
in times of drought could be easily and cheaply
irrigated and turned into something better than
the Garden of Eden, if it couldn’t give Paradise
itself a few points. The result was a fearsome
rush of would-be settlers, who regarded the high
prices as nothing when compared with the long
credit and the eloquence. The successful
applicants bogged in, put up houses, put
down crops, built pigsties, and expended much
energy, They were jubilant at the thought that,
even if the rain failed, the Goulburn wouldn’t.
One day the Goulburn started to irrigate on its
own account. It turned out the crops, and f J
its best to turn out the settlers, forcing them to
take to the tree life again after a lapse of some
thousands of years. Having lost their crops, the
farmers thought it would be a fair thing for the
Board to allow payment of instalments to stand
over. The Board wouldn’t, and the farmers got
into debt. The following season (last year)
the land was again under crop; and when
the rain failed, the settlers went to see
about turning on the Goulburn. They found it
was impossible, the Board having forgotten its
promise to make the water available. So the
crops died. Again the farmers pointed out that
it would be a fair thing to allow payment (if
instalments to stand over, and the Board
agreed. But in the meantime someone went
through with a camera, and said the crops were
not too bad, and that he had enjoyed his trip
through this home of quiet industry. The Board
never troubled to look for itself. It took the
general statement, and wrote the settlers that the
arrangement about postponing instalments was
off. It was a case of pay or close up. Many of
them closed up, and the Board found
itself left with a lot of valuable land. A
slump set in, and prices dropped from £8 to £4
per acre after the Board had vainly endeavored to
find anyone foolish enough to take the abandoned
selections. The blocks were put up to auction,
but those who came to the sale scoffed instead of
buying, and there was not a single bid. The
Board then tried to lease the land, but the highest
bid was Is. 6d. per acre per annum. This offer
the Board is still considering at time of
writing. The Bestdown, Memsie, Colbinab-
bin, and Tandarra settlements are all in the
same hole, and it will not be surprising
if the whole five do not come to almighty smash.
If the men who have been lured in could only get
back their cash they wouldn’t stay. But as they
can’t get their money back they struggle along.
The Closer Settlement Act is good only to the
land-grabbers who vend the soil at twice what it
is worth. It would be a good and serviceable Act
if it contained a compulsory purchase clause and
was backed up by a really good graduated land-
tax. But it doesn’t contain these things, and is,
therefore, worse than useless, and is doing a lot
to discredit, in the eyes of the mentally dull, any
system of Closer Settlement. —Yours, etc., J.G.

The KidSTON Government proposes to establish
the referendum in Queensland as a means of de-
ciding differences between the two Houses. The
idea is good enough, though the abolition of the
Upper House of Life Nominees would be simpler
and cheaper, and just the same thing in the end.
All the methods propounded for getting over the
difficulties that arise through having two kings in
Barataria reallvamount to schemes for government
by one House. In fact, we have a curious, shaky, il-
logical, demoralised kind of one-HouseGovernment
now. At one time the Upper House carries its
point—in Victoria it generally does—and then it
is a case of government by one House, and also
a case of the abolition of government by the
people. At another time the Assembly carries its
point; that is also government by one House.
Kidston’s proposed reform will only change
the situation by deciding which House is to
govern. The Council is either to give up
attempting to rule, and merely say ditto
to the Assembly, or if it seriously attempts
to rule it is to be suppressed by the popular vote.
And every attempted reform of Parliamentary
procedure points the same way, because it is the
one possible way. But though the only device
that can make the Parliamentary machine
really workable is to kill off one House,
there is an absurd and old-fashioned idea
that it is absolutely necessary to keep the
corpse on the premises. If Kidston’s scheme is
carried, the Queensland Upper House will be
quite dead for all practical legislative purposes
of any importance; but Kidston still, it would
seem, intends that the dead body shall meet regu-
larly, and pretend at great expense to be alive.
Queensland will gain nothing, and the dead body
will gain nothing ; but the thing is a matter of
habit, or something like that.

More trouble is impending for Victoria’s State
Premier, T. Bent. On the meeting of Parliament,
in June next, the Victorian Country party’s al-
leged present intention is to move for "the appoint-
ment of either a Royal Commission or a Select
Committee to inquire into that gentleman’s
alleged land transactions, and also into some
alleged dealings with a certain Melbourne
bank. So far, Bent’s public probity and
honesty have never been smirched by any
deal too dirty to be revealed. Partly
for that reason he cannot afford to fight
against an inquiry now. Australia has had too
many land scandals to allow what seems an alle-
gation of jobbery to remain merely as an alle-
gation and the suspicion of a smell. The
smell must either be proved to be the mere
delusion of a degraded and calumniating
nose, or else be traced to its source. The thing
cannot be merely disregarded ; the rumors
have been too persistent for that. Even the
Country party cannot now be permitted to merelv
let the matter drop. From it one of two things
is demanded —either the motion for an inquiry,
or a frank and explicit announcement that, having
made careful inquiries, it could find no grounds
whatever for the rumors. As for the Labor
party, it can, of course, have only one attitude •
it the Country party calls for an inquiry the
Labor party must support the demand. No other
attitude would tally with either the principles or
the traditions of a party which seeks first to find
out the truth, and then to follow it no matter
where it leads.

“A Modern Adventuress,” the new Sydney
Criterion show, may not plumb the nethermost
depths of melodramatic banality (indeed long con-
sideration goes to suggest that these are pretty
well unfathomable, and where the illimitable
begins the two-foot rule leaves off); but it dives
deep. A mad-house atmosphere pervades this
play. Few of us in these over-policed days have
had the chance to personally witness a genuine
assassination ; yet we all, while reading our daily
papers in the secure circle of the home, have at
one time or another reconstructed a deed of blood
in imagination. And if there is any earthly con-
vention upon which normal citizens are agreed, it
is that the correct attitude of the murderer at
the supreme moment should be one of serious-
ness. There is nothing intrinsically humorous in
taking the life of a blameless fellow-creature. At
the best it needs must be an unsavory and nerve-
racking job. But Violet Meredith, the Criterion
Adventuress, views things differently. She finds
her slayings quite funny. The spilling of human
gore appeals to her in the light of a good jest.
She laughs oonsumedlv as she stabs to the heart
dear old plutocratic William Delhv; then sets
fire to a cigarette, and with awful callousness
puffs the smoke in the deceased gentleman’s
glazing eyes. She cannot keep a straight face
during the commission of any of her misdeeds.
The sight of a corpse is a thing that would
make her laugh in church. And a like
trait is to be found in her maniacal
abettor, Danton. Steve, her father a
dreadful old man, whose huge eye-patch and
zebra-like face-stripes give him an aspect scarcely
human—alternates between merriment and hys-
terical grief with horribly significant suddenness.
So when, later on, we find Violet has had Irim
immured “among the rats in the darkest dungeon
of Bays water Asylum ” we are not surprised.
The comic relief gets into the astounding picture
at the jump and stays there till the curtain falls.
* * * *
The plot is concerned largely with the
sorrows of Harry Delby, son of the feloniously
slain William aforementioned. The palladium of
British justice goes temporarily astray in
Harry’s case, as a result of which he (1) is
convicted of a forgery he has not committed;
(2) is arrested in connection with one of Violet’s
murders, and (3) divorces his innocent wife on the
grounds of her misconduct with “ Pietro Donelli,
a world-famed Italian sculptor.” This Italian is
one of the most startlingly erratic characters ever
presented to any audience. He is in love with
Harry’s wife, who—worthy spouse and mother
that she is—spurns his advances. So he pene-
trates to her room at midnight, or thereabouts, in
order to “ compromise her in the eyes of the
world,” and make her “ a thing of loathing to her
husband.” While the compromising process is in
train an inert substance, with white hair or wool
on it, and alleged to be a child, which is in
the anguished lady’s bed, attracts the attention
of the foreigner. A revulsion of feeling
comes. He concusses his brow with his
paw. He repents. “ No,” he cries brokenly,
“Peetro vish not to ’arm a child. ’E vill go.”
It is while the penitent Dago is (in all innocence)
bestowing a farewell kiss on the owner of the
thing in the bed that Harry, accompanied by the
Adventuress, peers through a window and gets
the material for his decree nisi. The Latin does
not attend during the hearing of the divorce suit.
Instead, he remains sculping in Italy, without the
jurisdiction, and expresses helpless astonishment
on learning the verdict. He starts in haste for
England to prove Mrs. Delby’s innocence. He
has barely landed when Violet, who amasses
corpses as another might amass stamps, essays to
add him to her collection. For the first time in her
career she fails. Pietro is heaved by herdownasteep
place with the usual weapon adhering to the cus-
tomary spot—but he unexpectedly returns. Harry
dashes forward, and for no apparent reason elects
suddenly to swallow the moribund Pietro’s version
of the bedroom episode. This is the signal for the
landscape to become alive with policemen, who
arrest such undesirables as are at hand ; whereat,
amid cries of joy, the entertainment concludes.

Harrie Ireland, as Violet, acriminal lunatic .
with a distorted sense of humor, is wholly satis-
factory. She acts up to her clothes right through;
a remarkable feat. Godfrey Cass convinces in the
role of Danton, a white-faced malevolent zany of
a most dangerous type. Max Maxwell is Pietro
Donelli, an amiable, well-meaning idiot; the sort
of dotty ’ subject who is allowed access to the
asylum grounds, and fancies he is the Pope or
Michelangelo or Jawbone Neild. Steve Mere-
dith, as portrayed by J. P. O’Neill, is a more
horrifying brand of maniac ; drink and violent
emotions have combined, in his case, to unseat
a never over-strong intellect. Other parts that
call for mention are those of Sallv Hodges (Ethel
Buckley) and Vivette Delby (Helen Fergus).

unpleasant husband gets crushed under a lift,
with no greater injury than that his 6ft. 4in. are
reduced to 4ft. 6in. An awful sight is that little

vindictively pursuing the guilty and leaping pair<

Butt-Rumford and co., with manager Taifc
(trying not to look as haughty as he feels, for fear
there may be something in the adage about pride
going previous to a sudden downward movement),
are back in Sydney after their triumphal tour of
Rainbow Troutland. The Maorilanders sup-
ported the gigantic contralto to the extent of 21
concerts, and the queues made by the concert-goers
who didn’t reserve their seats grew and grew
much faster than the vegetable-marrow vine in
the Bible, and coiled around street corners and
distant blocks, and down lanes, and up rights-of-
way until strangers, coming upon the tip of the
queue, asked in amazement, “ What great person
js this who can afford such a length of tail?”
In Wanganui, Mrs. Butt saw a poi-dance,
but she missed the moss on the river. At the
Town Hall, on Saturday next, the Big Lady will
start her closing Sydney season. Concerts will
occur also on Wednesday (matinee) and Thursday
and the ensuing Saturday (21st). Later the
mighty voice will hurry professionally in seven-
league boots through Brisbane, Melbourne, Ade-
laide and Perth.

This week’s Sydney Tivoli bill is the twin
brother of last week’s, with one or two minor
alterations. The Bulletin regrets to note that
Alma Gray has stained her countenance brown
and substituted a rather uninteresting coon song
for the former Australian melody. Ike and
Will Scott have a couple of new turns, but Frank
Harwood persists with the same elderly jests that
he had seven days ago. The Cunards, the
Sisters Klos, and the Artois Brothers are
the three towers of strength on which the
programme mainly rests. Terry and Bentley
have a good bit of humorous dialogue, and
the lady partner sings a dainty little French song,
which sparkles like a star amid the mass of jaded
“coon’’airs. Also Muriel Andrews, the clever
girl violiniste, weaves a couple of golden melodies.

“Brewster’s Millions” introduced the
Brough-Kingston Co. at Melbourne Princess’s on
Saturday. A comedy in the announcements, it
is, in reality, a broad farce, which hits an audience
on the spot where it keeps its laughter. The
blithe improbabilities of “Brewster” deal with
kingly sums of money, and mediocre young men
and women, and a worldlysuperfluous matron, and
they hang together just sufficiently to make the
interest continuous. Monty Brewster is one of the
seven Little Sons of the Rich—a coterie of youths
with “expectations.” Monty realises his to an
embarrassing extent. A grandfather dies, and
leaves him £200,(100. A malignantly humorous
maternal uncle, who hates the ancient testator,
proceeds, with an ingenious post mortem hatred,
to will £2,000,000 to Monty on a condition that is
calculated to make the deceased grand-dad turn
over heavily in his grave. Monty must rid himself
of the original £200,000. He must not diverge
far from the way of Judkins, and yet within
a year he must have scattered grandfather’s
money to the dogs and the winds. And the
awful .danger is that Monty may get through
only £199,900 in the specified time, and be
left with £lOO and a forfeited fortune. Monty
has a girl A-the usual ingenue girl—who helps
him to make milk-and-watery love scenes. Monty
has his six Little Brothers of the Rich. Monty
knows a portly good fairy called Mistress Dan de
Mille. With this stock-in-trade, he starts
out to make cash expenditure the first aim
of his life. He does wildly ridiculous
things with huge precision and wonderful
luck. He backs rank outsiders, which win at
sickeningly large odds. He invests in foolish finan-
cial schemes, which at once commence to pay 100
per cent, dividends. He sets up a chorus nymph
as a comic-opera star. She makes the hit of the
season, and tries to pay him back what she has
cost him. He goes into business and employs the
other Six Little Sons as his managers. He cables
conjunctions and prepositions punctiliously to run
up expenses. He does everything that he dares to
do under the terms of the rabid uncle’s benefac-
tion, and on every hand he is protected against
himself by his pals. At last the faceful year
wears to its last day, and Brewster is found on a
yacht, in mid-ocean, with £40,000 still left. The
yacht strikes a gale, and a riotous, ribald Monty
runs up a flag of distress, and is towed in by a
passing vessel which charges him £40,000 for
salvage.

Mrs. Brough, as Mrs. Dan, the wise
chaperone of foolish protegees, received a ter-
rific welcome on Saturday, and a garden of flowers.
But she gets no chance to be more than gracious
of manner and speech and an edifying spectacle.
As the guardian-in-chief of Brewster’s ingenue,
she spends little time in the centre of the stage,
which is a grief to her ardent and faithful admirers.
All the limelight and most of the acting opportuni-
ties fall to Brewster. Thomas Kingston represents
that young man as having marked Amurrican
characteristics, though the play is located in Lon-
don, and most of its allusions are Hinglish. He
rattles and bustles through the pregnant year
with ingratiating vivacity, until about the second
act. Then his extreme activity of body and
intonation begins to make a lymphatic listener
nervous. But he never misses a point, and
holds the action taut all the while. Of the
Seven Little Sons, Leonard Willey and Gregan
McMahon have chances to help Monty to
a “situation,” and of thesechances they avail them-
selves very neatly. Miss Calvin plays Peggy as an
ultra-naive, and unarresting young person, and
Nellie Fergusson projects her study of a novel-
writing female quite outside the picture.

“A Warning to Women” is still within>
the reach of so many of the sex as live within a
Sabbath-day’s journey of Melbourne Royal. The
ladies rush to the T.R. in large numbers. They
adore the lovely frocks of Miss Hildyard, and her
realism makes them feel how glad they are that
vice and weakness are no part of their moral ward-
robes. When Miss “ Morde ” staggers round in a
magnificent gown and a state of intoxication, they
surmise that even gowns like that aren’t worth
pursuing through the neck of a brandy bottle,
and lay much unction to their single-fronted
souls. Women really enjoy the sort of
horror that is obtainable at the hands of
•Miss’ Hildyard, because it brings to them
some little consolation for never “having been
tempted in their inexperienced youth. No other
explanation occurs to the writer for the full
houses which condone Miss Hildyard’s dramatic
misdemeanor. “ A Great Awakening ” will be
expounded next Saturday night.

Urged thereto by the furious onset of
General Request, “ Mother Goose ” was restored
at Melbourne Her Majesty’s, last Saturday night,
the profuse eloquence of that amiable dame is
much as it was previously. When she talks
(which is most of the time) she covers much
ground with her conversation. She has many
things to talk about, including her troubles.
Though she has leaped to sudden affluence,
*u- re u no in her fowl’s repertoire
which will repair her aged and ravaged counte-
nance. However, Mrs. G. remedies her unhuman
defects by means of the magic pool, from which
she emerges with the beauty and bloom of sixteen,
but with the advanced tastes of seventy. She
finds the incongruity worse than the ugli-
ness, and, by special arrangement, she gets
back her old countenance and her dis-
astrous facial appointments. As formerly, Mrs.
Goose owes her grotesque blandishments and
giddy ways to Harry Phydora, who, with Harry
Shine as the disrespectful offspring, makes most
of the bad jokes. Miss Mabelle Morgan and
Miss Lena Ericson are inefficient substitutes for
Misses Florence Young and Celia Ghiloni, who
were two attractive warblers in the initial pro-
duction. In addition, the elegant tameness of
Miss Maud Thorne leaves an impression that the
show isn’t 10 miles from an impoverished and
anaemic absurdity. Next to the resplendent
swing song, the best turn is that of Miss Olga
Grey, who gives smart imitations of well-known
men and women. She is a pretty damsel, and
she would be well-advised to confine herself to
female impersonations. She is much more suc-
cessful in that branch of her business than in the
other.

West’s Pictures, which combine the

Africa, about the land where Numa Pompilius is
alleged to have “ chinned ” to Egeria, about any
land where man’s implements of locomotion have
borne his bulk and a camera, T. J. West seems to
have reliable information. This he flaunts upon
his acre of sheeting at very moderate prices. Thus
any citizen can supplement his suspicion of
geographical knowledge with a visit to the flick-
emporium, and, between acts, imbibe, for a small
coin, a long cool squash through a straw. For the
nearest pub is (alas !) quite ten thirsts distant.

At Melbourne Bijou the frolic of “ Miss
Lancashire, Ltd.” still abides, like an oft-cursed
poor relation. Seemingly, the freaks and break-
ages of that philosopher and domestic help, Mary
Thompson, have grown from being a mere quaint
novelty to the dignity of a national institution.
The result is not altogether unaccountable. Mary
is a young lady of uncommon vocabulary, and as
a humorist she has the same unobtrusive charm
as the long red nose of the clown and the clothes
of the melodrama humorist. Consequently the
rush of business is in its sixth week, and the music
(the only music worth notice) is that caused by
the tremulous tinkle of a cataract of coin.

From “Frank C.”:—
Only Judkins and the gods, who know all things, can
explain the whereforeness of the huge crowds that Mel-
bourne furnished to Skuthorpe’s buckjumping shows.
After his return from Cohentingenting, Skuthorpe
treated Yarra-siders to the same bill-of-fare as now,
repeating the dose a few years later. The first time, his
exhibition was as great a frost as the cap of Kosciusko ;
last time, he did a little better ; but now—his name
is Cash. Yet the show is unchanged. Saturday
saw a 20,000 crowd swarm over Richmond race-
course, pay from ss. to Is., and stand in the
blazing sun and dust for three hours to watch a few
horsemen sit alleged outlaws for perhaps 10 minutes
altogether. Australia, female as well as male, loves a
horse, whether it be a clean-limbed thoroughbred or a
ragged-looking prad with a temper as short as its pedi-
gree—yet the show was the same seven years ago, and
nobody wanted it then. Doubtless advertisement had a
lot to do with it, and the fine Roman hand of Citizen
Wren was plainly discernible in Skuthorpe’s advts.; in fact,
there is a suspicion at times that Wren is Skuthorpe
and S. is Wren. Anyhow, the buckjump final trans-
pired on Wren’s racecourse, and the first prize
of £4O and gold medal went to Bert Fletcher,
of Perth (W.A.). J. Callaghan, a Collingwood
half-caste, was second, and Dick Basan, of Tooradin
(Gippsland), third. In between whiles the local youths
essayed to mount certain placid bullocks, and one or two
older infants tackled Dargin’s Grey. The Grey can still
buck a trifle, but it seems to the writer that it is time he
was given a rest; no horse can live for ever, neither can he
buck much when he is old and bald. To wind up, some
alleged American cow-hoys pitted their method of lasso-
ing and tying a bullock against the Australian’s plan of
grabbing the beast by the tail and capsizing him. To
this end a mob of alleged Queensland bullocks had been
driven on to the course, and were grazing placidly on the
dust at the far end. They were driven up in front of the
stand, and the crowd closed round and fenced them in
while Dick- Skuthorpe and Broncho George and their
assistants alternately chased them around. Each caught
one, threw him, and tied him, the Yankee plan being
much the slower of the two—while the crowd closed in
and offered suggestions. It was a pleasing spectacle, but
this writer would much like to know if these bullocks were
reared on the bottle, or fed with a spoon, or how. One
irresponsible drunk got trodden on by an uproarious
“ outlaw,” and a bullock walked over a small child, but
the usual luck of those persons stood by them, and the
ambulance wasn’t needed.

At Melbourne Opera House the same
creatures who inspired this paper’s optimistic re-
flections last week are still the props and glories
of a very meritorious bill. Upon further analysis
the Great Kaufmanns pan out even better than
they looked at first. Sentiment is provided by
negro-balladist Tisdale ; whilst the sobs of the
Sisters Albert make this writer yearn. Also
Margaret Parker’s melodramette is like the creak
of new boots in a tomb. It is very, very sad, and
there seems no very definite reason why it should
be there at all.

“The Squatter’s Daughter ” attained the
glory of being fined for overcrowding at Adelaide.
As a matter of fact, people were standing three
deeD all over the Royal every evening for a fort-
night. The Law put its commodious foot down-
after the season was over —and collected from the
wildly-protesting management the price of 34
“ popular ” admission tickets. The Allan Hamil-
ton Co. has since been reviving that quaint
Dickensy-Christmas kind of play “ A Messagefrom
Mars,” but has now come down to a dreadful piece
called “ Home, Sweet Home.” There is an
Operascope ” at the Town Hall, and the Tivoli
does its best for country visitors to the Show ; but
Adelaide has been spending most of its days in
inspecting agricultural implements, and its nights
in watching swimming “ carnivals.”
AT POVERTY POINT.
“Acacia”: Saw, the other night, “The Prisoner of
Zenda.” Not having read the book the trio of roles
played by the versatile Julius muddled me up consider-
ably, but after thinking hard for some 15 minutes I grasped
that the red hair and moustache and sauerkraut appear-
ance of Julius were supposed to be the result of
a twopenny-halfpenny German princelet visiting England
one hundred years before. Being English myself I
marvelled that anything- English could look so' proud
as Julius did to claim lineal descent—with such a decided
smudge—from the red-haired petty princelet referred to.
Other incidents got upon my nerves and morals—for
instance, that last scene adjacent to the king’s prison in
the castle at Zenda. The celebrated flight of the Christian
Mercia from the amorous Marcus Briefshirtibus is a pale
circumstance compared to the purple atmosphere in the
castle, when Black Michael’s A.’sD.C. make such hot
siege of Antoinette de Mauban. First, Hentzau seizes the
lady and kisses her madly. Her terrified shrieks bring
Fritz to her rescue. Fritz dismisses the understrapper
with a curse, bolts the door, seizes Antoinette roughly
and kisses—or bites—her all over the stage, to an accom-
paniment of piercing screams. If Julius hadn’t arrived
when he did, I should certainly have called a policeman.
Such assaults on a lone, unprotected female ought to be
put down.
The other night, at Melbourne Princess’s, Frank Thorn-
ton, assuming a feminine privilege, “went off” when play-
ing “Charley’s Aunt.” It was a true faint, and Auntie had
to be carried into the wings, and treated with whisky
and ammonia before consenting to come round. Mean-
while, the full strength of theco. was gagging desperately
to fill in time. Auntie made another stagger at it after
about five minutes, and was cheered for her grit.
Mrs. Margaret Allcott, who committed suicide, the
other day, on the Metropolitan railway, London, is said
to have been upon the stage in Australia under the name
of Leighton.
As it will run into £l4OO to hire a band to blare in the
Australian section of the Shepherd’s Bush Exhibition, it
is suggested that Australia should provide its own blare.
This country has half-a-dozen or more crack bands that
could do Australia proud against the best, and there’s no
sense in hiring foreigners to blow our trumpet when we
can make the trumpet and blow it with our own local
breath. The first idea was to send along the champion
Boulder City (W.A.) band, but probabilities are that a
specially picked lot will be despatched.
“ Snell ” : The most interesting of a long list of pur-
chases announced by J. C. Williamson is certainly Henri
Bernstein’s drama, “ The Thief.” Rogue dramas are much
to the taste of British and American playgoers just lately.
Witness the success of “ Leah Kleschna,” “ Raffles,” and
now “The Thief,” done into English by Howard
Chambers. With great technical skill, and a story that
goes like a 40-h.p. motor, Bernstein carries his pilfering
heroine through with such dash that audiences haven’t
time to realise that a rather paltry kind of pilferer has
been foisted on them as a keenly sympathetic character.
The heroine is the thief, and she robs her friends to obtain
the means of making herself beautiful in the eyes of her
elderly husband, whom she adores, but who evidently
is not a first-rate provider. In construction Bernstein
does well, and “ The Thief ” has rushed him into pro-
minence.
“Jean S.” : This “ Warning to Women” at the Mel-
bourne Royal seems to be a discourse on the taints of
heredity with the tragical inconsequence of woman
thrown in. You are presented with a morphino-dipso-
maniac—a type rarely borne out by facts—who, imme-
diately following a contest with the bottle, seeks further
comfort from a hypodermic syringe. Her cravings are
patent enough to make her condition obvious to a blind
man ; but no one, except an ancient Hibernian beldame,
appears to notice it. The old woman is palpably dis-
tressed by the drink and drug proceedings, yet, under a
very littie pressure, she is willing to yield up to the
drunkomaniac any quantity of the drug. Apparently
she is the only source of supply. Again, the morphino-
dipso. learns from a mere stranger that her own mother
expired in a fit of the d.t.’s, and her terror at the com-
munication is only ''\eeeded by her extreme hate of the
communiuui i ..au gentleman just missesthe contents
of a bottle containing vitriol, thrown so carelessly by the
morphino-drunk that she blinds her own lover. After
that, when she departs upon the arm of the man she most
hates in all the world, leaving her blinded beloved to the
care of her younger sister, she appears even too inconse-
quential for a morphino-dipso. Later she gets what she
demands—jewels, flowers, music, literature, liquor,
frocks, everything—yet scorns and curses her protector
for the gifts. This is really carrying inconsequence too far.
“ Melb.”: The new theatre, Russell-street, has the
walls up 20ft. inside and out. So it is definitely
sketched. It is the smallest in Melbourne, and will not
hold more than 1500. Though Anderson and Bland Holt
are talked of as the lessees, I think it will ultimately
become a comedy house. Of course, there are to be no
drinkery privileges, so the neighboring pubs view the
work in a friendly spirit. The nearest are the Austral,
on the Bourke-street corner, and the Portland, half-a-
dozen doors above the theatre, on the little Collins-
street corner. These pubberies will have their value
about doubled. The Portland is making some luxurious
alterations to suit the new emergency. The Austral has
not started doing so as yet. It is next to the theatre,
with the intervention of a lane, and a considerable length
of billiard-room. Doubtless a bar will be put where the
billiard-room is, so that the beer will be intensely adja-
cent to the playhouse. When you save 20 yards’ walking
at an interval it gives you time for an extra drink.
“ A.C.”: It is hissed in the vicinity of many free-lunch
counters that the arrival of the Asturias with J.C.W.
aboard will cause big alterations in the Theatre Royal
management. If not, it is prophesied that Sheol must
eventuate as swiftly and surely as a “ Claudian ” earth-
quake. Julius, the Imperial, has been “ starring” on his
absolute own. Ola Humphrey claims that she left her
happy U.S.A. home on the understanding that she w’ould
be as prominent a constellation in the Commonwealth
firmament as Julius. She has not been, not by
a hatful. It is Julius who has laved himself night
after night in the limelight; Julius who has glared
haughtily in beautiful clothes ffotri every hoarding for
months past; and Julius likewise whoke name has
stared in clamant letterings out of the Theatre Royal
programmes and ads. The fallen or bar mummer
(also other sorts of mummer) holds that this
state of things is horrible. He denounces Julius,
pointing out to his fellow mimes that he (the
fallen or bar mummer aforesaid) would, in Julius’ place,
have demeaned himself differently. Later he goes outside,
whereat his companions gather round the cloves and
damn him as a liar of a curiouly poisonous breed.
But the maligned Bacchanalian would seem, in part at
any rate, to speak sooth. More than a change of bill
threatens at Sydney Royal.
“Haresfoot”: “Camille” was first produced at the
little Theatre Vaudeville, Paris, in 1850, with Fechter as
Armand, and Mrs. Doche, wife of the orchestral leader,
as Camille. The drama was produced in Australia long be-
fore London would tolerate it. Mary Provost acted Camille
here in 1858, and there was bitter complaint from the
Grundy female. The management aroused sympathy, and
partly mollified the Grundy creature, by assuring the
public that Miss Provost was really dying, of consumption,
and there was a natural disinclination to throw clods at
the lady in her last hours. But a very robust Miss Provost
is said to have been acting old women in America 20
years afterwards. Bernhardt’s first Australian appear-
ance was as Camille.
Prominent in various English pantomimes this year
were players well-known in Australia —Carrie Moore,
Edward Lauri, Lawton, May Moore Duprez, Julian
Digges, and the McNaughtons. Miss Duprez was the
Gretchen von Vetchen of a “ Mother Goose ” revival, and
Lawton just whistled as of old —in two or three different
houses every night.
The Sunday closing of theatres and music halls in New
York has proved a complete failure, and after two or
three weeks’ trial the new law was rescinded. There
were three good reasons for its non-success. (1) It came
too late, the Sunday amusement having got a big start
and become a “ vested interest.” (2) The disappointed
amusement-seekers simply became drunk and disorderly
in the streets, instead of keeping comparatively sober
and quiet indoors. And (3) with the hopelessly corrupt
police force that Yankee methods have created, the
closing-law was only partly enforced, it being about a
level-money chance whether anv given show was actually
closed or not. '
Anna Held, the musical comedy star, famed for her
eyes that won’t behave, and her clothes that defy imita-
tion, is suffering from an absolutely original complaint.
She is ill from over-dressing—from owning too many
clothes. As a result she has had to retire from “ The
Parisian Model” —the’ N’Yark musical comedy success
wherein she changes her dresses 13 times every night.
The list of clothes shed in this piece is imposing, viz : (1)
Black silk princess robe ; (2) Black crepe-de-chine prin-
cess robe ; (3) Morning gown ; (4) Afternoon gown ; (5)
Driving gown ; (6) Dinner dress ; (7) Black street dress ;
(8) Evening dress, decollete ; (9) Dhcollete gown of gold
cloth; (10) White silk costume; (11) White evening
dress ; (12) Pink evening dress ; (13) Skating costume.
In addition to these she has been wont for some time
past to make daily six other changes incidental to her
social life outside the theatre. The utter joy of such an
existence has proved too much for the lady, and she is now
dancing a nervous breakdown in a sanatorium. Many
women wish they had half her complaint.

in Melbourne. Welch, amongst other things, revealed
the way in which a modern comedy is written. It is not
encouraging to the budding Sheridan or Wycherly.
“The prompt-book of ‘When Knights Were Bold,'”
prattled James, “is a literary curiosity. There is not a
page of the original manuscript left intact. At every
performance a shorthand writer is stationed in the wings
and takes down every new word or bit of business that is
introduced, and also records at just what the audience
laughs each night. Then the next day, at rehearsal, the
play is changed to suit the latest liking of the audience.”
Gilbert (he who in his old age lost his sense of the
ludicrous and endured a knighting) used to write
humorous pieces. Also he was wont to stand
in the wings of the Savoy (London) Theatre night after
night, during the run of most of his plays, and narrowly
observe the “ business ” and the way in which his jests
were delivered. No stenographer accompanied him. If
any libretto-recorded detail of gesture or movement were
omitted, if the tiniest gag w'ere interpolated or left out,
if a voice inflection in the dialogue differed from the par-
ticular voice inflection Gilbert had laid down at rehearsal
as the only possible one for the situation, there was forth-
with a tall, anguished genius to be observed struggling
wildly with a posse of scene-shifters, and clamoring to be
allowed to go on the stage and do severe mischief upon
the sacrilegious offender who had misinterpreted his work.
And that, after all, is the proper spirit, and the one which
makes for good work on the part of actor and author
alike. Nothing more clearly explains the utter fatuity of
the average modern farce than the news that the dreadful
effort is not the work of any one intelligent writer, but of
an infamous collaboration between the (mostly) unintel-
ligent players who first interpret it, the (mostly) unintel
ligent public which first acclaims it, and a shorthand
writer.
“ Hamer ” : “ Blue Peter ” (B. 30/l/’08) touches the edge
of a great truth when he remarks that “ the gods’
approval is guided by punctuation.” Some stage
managers make a point of explaining to their performers
just where a laugh ora “ round ” comes in, and instructing
them to wait for it ; and usually if the “wait” is long
enough the required article is supplied by the house—if
there is sufficient house to supply it. It is in working
these pauses—or rather in not working them—that
actresses manage to hand out most of their sweet revenges
on one another. Writer has known a much-hated actress
whose part was completely spoiled by her loving sisters
jumping hurriedly on her “points” and treading out
firmly any applause that might be gathering in the house.
The wealthy Vedrenne management is billed to open at
the Queen’s Theatre, London, this week with “ a realistic
four-act modern Australian play.” “Stingaree” is the
title of the piece—it being founded on the wild and im-
possible batch of “ Stingaree ” yarns which appeared in
one of the British magazines recently. A strong cast
interprets the new production. Henry Ainley, the
Shakspearian actor, plays Greville Dare (“ Stingaree ”);
O. P. Heggie is Sam ; Athol Forde is “a Riverina squat-
ter,” and Herbert Waring is some other brand of squat-
ter. There is a State Governor in the cast, an aboriginal
or two, a rabbit inspector, a station overseer, a Sydney
Town Hall attendant—in brief, samples of all known
indigenous human growths barring a bottle-o. If the
play is anything like the stories of its origin it will be a
hideous libel on this peaceful and fairly law-abiding land ;
on the other hand, if it’s not it will be a frost, the British
public having learned (mostly via the Daily Mail)to take
the local importer’s view of Australian morals, and to
consider all attempts to present any other view as con-
fidence business and something related to an uncle in
Fiji.
The actor-manager (peripatetic) was explaining that
the worst audience he had ever encountered was at
Wallace, a Bungaree (Vic.) township devoted to cow cul-
ture and the growth of tubers. “.We were giving a really
excellent performance of that very fine classic, ‘ East
Lvnne,’” said the actor-manager, “ a most excellent per-
formance, but it was pearls before swine, my boy, pearls
before swine. We were abused, we were laughed at.
Our heroine received insolent gibes. Our scenery—hand-
painted, and quite superb in its way—was received with
derision. I was never more insulted in my life, believe
me.” “ Why didn’t you turn the confounded audience
away?” asked a brother artist. “ I would have done so,
my boy,” replied the actor-manager, “ I would really, only
I needed the shilling.”
THE BAD MINSTREL.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Mr. G. H. Reid delivered a lecture on New South Wales
and the Commonwealth at the School of Arts last night.
He said that although Federation had fallen into dis-
favor, he was sure it would work out all right.— Daily
■paper.
I heard a minstrel playing an elderly, hoarse bassoon,
And some long-drawn howls went with it up to the
list’ning moon.
No one was there to hearken, for the night was dark and
cold ;
The minstrel was a bad one, and the tune was very old.
The wind blew round the corner, and snatched at the
dismal air ;
The skies they wept in anguish—the moon wore a ghastly
stare.
Most of the notes were false ones—all of the rest were
flat;
But still he blew with vigor and held out a ragged hat.
I heard a minstrel playing, and knew that he played by
ear.
I heard a loud voice shouting, “ Go on now ! clear out of
here ! ”
The tune went out in a gurgle—the cur gave a final howl,
And, looking out, I saw them away in the shadows
prowl.

THE PRO.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The actor thickly paints his face,
He darkens up his eyes,
Until there’s scarcely left a trace
Of his own elemental grace—
Which, possibly, is wise.
He wears another fellow’s clo’s,
Another fellow’s hair ;
He strikes another fellow’s pose,
And spouts another fellow’s prose
’Neath a fictitious glare.
His legs are rarely quite his own.
Nor yet his chest of pride,
Still, in this wide terrestrial zone,
There is no other creature known
Who’s so self-satisfied l .

S. Australia, where stinking fish isn’t often
on the menu, has just ripped a stray leaf out of
Sydney’s book of experiences, and has buiit its
latest lifeboat in its own Government yards at
Port Adelaide. It is over 40 years since S. Aus.
built such a boat; and when it looks on the fine
little all-Australian craft that has been turned out
now, it reckons that those 40 years might have
been put to a good deal better use. The boat is
for use at Port McDonnell, on the tricky south-
east coast.
The police-court report is stranger than
fiction, and a lot more readable. This is a narra-
tive which was lately unfolded in a Sydney
temple of justice. On December 13, 1907, a lady
heard a noise in one of the bedrooms of her house
and. on going to investigate, saw a strange man in
bed. She screamed and rushed to the front door.
Just as she ran out, the strange male person leaped
out of the window. The courageous woman
charged him as he was scrambling to his feet, and
started thumping him as hard as she could. The
perfect stranger apparently made no resistance,
but hurried away. By this time a gentleman, or
nobleman, who had been in the kitchen burst
through the doorway and set off in pursuit of the
rest-cure crank, who fled without much discretion
into an outhouse of an adjoining residence and
locked the. door. The pursuer stood outside,
panting, and told the man inside, in a stern voice,
that he was going to have him locked up. The
fugitive who was already locked in —*
pleaded to be let off. He assured the pursuer
that he had “been at the game all his life”'
(it isn’t clear what he meant by this),
and that he had only gone into the house because
he was hungry (he didn’t explain how the act of
retiring to bed was going to satisfy his hunger).
Then he asked to be taken across the road to
a priest, and the pursuer agreed.* When the
two of them found the father and placed the
astonishing facts before him, his reverence
couldn’t see very clearly what he had to
do with the case, and after deep thought sug-
gested that the mysterious bedder seemed to have
done no definite harm, and might be allowed to
go. He was allowed, ?md he went. But the police
heard of it, and re-arrested the occupier of strange
bods on a charge of untidy proceedings, and as by
this time he couldn’t remember why he went to
bed in a strange house, he left the matter in its
original state of simple my’stery.

“ I sold my soul to the Devil once,” said
the hairy one, rising on his elbow in the large
room at the Central into which prisoners are
drafted from the cells in early morning. “Get
much?” asked a companion in misery. “Pro-
mises in plenty. Three meals a day for 10 years ;
not less ’n two quarts of beer ; as much terbacker
as I could smoke, an’ a new suit every other
month.” “For ten year ! Gosh, you did get in
on’m. Thought Old Harry could do a better deal
’n that! ” “Where was this?” asked another.
“In the Domain,” replied Hairy. “’Twas after
midnight when he prodded me up and made the
offer. I wasn’t talcin’ no guiver, so he showed me
his tail as a guarantee o’ good faith.” “Well,
what happened to the good times?” “Oh, he
was a fraud. Just as everything was
settled, up comes a John an’ a keeper an’
takes ’m back ter Callan Park. When
he made such a big offer I half suspected
he was loony, an’ sure enough he was.”

St. John’s Church of England, at
Heidelberg (Vic.), is just now in the
throes of a tremendous argument, com-
pared to which the question of a material
Hell is a trifle. In this kirk the pews, as
the orchestra stalls are called, are fur-
nished with doors ; and while evil-minded
innovators want to abolish these doors,
the elderly parishioners, with recollec-
tions of the Cold Country, object, and
aver that the others are ravening heathens
with scant respect for the old and the
musty. St. Jack’s vestry got as far as
voting on the question recently, but the
parties were equal, and the vicar said
he didn’t see his way clear to give a
casting vote on so momentous a matter.
So the uproar and argument continue,
and the congregation is rent in twain.
Yet the remedy seems simple. Use the
old-fashioned hinges which, allow of a
door being hung or unhung at a moment’s
notice. If all the inhabitants of a pew
want the door on, let it be on. If they
want it off, let it be off. If they are un-
certain, let the door be painted a bright
green and left that way till they make up
their minds. If there are an odd number
of people in a pew, and they are divided,
let the majority decide. If there are an
even number of people in a pew, and they
are equally divided, let the door be on
one Sunday and off the next, or on in the
morning and off in the evening; or let
half a door be on, or let a whole door be
half on —i.e., hung by one hinge. Give all
possible facilities for the exchange of
sittings, so that doorers and non-doorers
may get together and be at peace. Also
let discarded doors be stacked in the
vestry till wanted. .
“ Chink,” from a Victorian mining town :
The usual amazing- J.P. put his cumbersome tro.:er in
a large-sized hole here recently.
A couple of him, sitting in judgmentover a lady drunk,
put its collective fearsome head together, assumed a
bottomless look, and then solemnly announced that,
“taking into consideration the six previous convictions
recorded against accused, we have decided to award her
12 months’ imprisonment.”
The Court murmured. The accused gaspeu hard, and
then exploded violently.
“ What! ” she screamed. “ Twelve months I You
eternal fools, you don’t know the law. You can't give
me more than 14 days.”
It was true. The clerk supported her, and a couple of
outraged honorariums tartiy handed out 14 days’ ’ai d.
A noteworthy and pathetic feature of the case is that
accused (a well-educated and once-refined woman) started
her downward track by being one of ('o '— unfortunate
and pitiful mistakes—a white girl married to a .man of
color.
THINGS BADLY EXPRESSED.
SHE (coyly): “ Oh , you’d like my cousin, she's such a pretty girl."
H E (amorously “I doN't like pretty girls."
The Victorian Bakers’ Society Moves to do
away with night work altogether, and good luck
to the agitation ! Italy manages to cook its bread
between 4 a.m. and 8 p.m., and prescribes gaol
for breaking the law ; and Maoriland starts at
4 a.m., and anything over eight hours per separate
day must be paid for at progressively increasing
overtime rates. Yet, so far, nobody has threat-
ened to take his capital out of either country* or
break up the home unless he is allowed to heat the
staff of life in the middle of the night. In fact,
Melbourne itself once started baking at 6 a.m. ;
but the system broke down through a few black-
leg employers rushing their hot, indigestible
loaves on to customers, with no regard for
little Billy and small Mary.

Curious the wild enthusiasm with which
the untravelled British female cleaves to any
alien with a colored skin who crosses her line of
vision. Lobengula, a buck nigger of unpleasant
aspect and absolutely unspeakable habits, while
on show in an imitation Kaffir kraal at Earl’s
Court Exhibition, ten years ago, had a marvellous
success with the London girls. They rushed
him in scores. Finally he dropped his knob*
kerry to one who possessed much gold* and
suffered her to marry him. After a Month he
deserted his bride, and vamoosed with most
of her money and another woman—where-
from arose many law actions. The Babu
studying for the Bar at one or other of the
Temples can, if he wills, wed the fairest
maid of all the lodging-house society he
affects. He deals but one glance of his
beautiful black orbs, and she is his till death.
In these circles the Babu is always known
vaguely as “Prince.” The same rule applies
to the West African savage visiting London
in search of culture, and to the colored
gentleman from the Indies. Japs and
Chows, so they be not destitute of cash,
have for long been reckoned matrimonial
scoops among Cold Country virgins. The
daughter of a belted English earl (who well
deserved to be belted herself) is married to
a nig, who, in his own land, is esteemed
“no class.” Siamese are socially acceptable
everywhere; Solomon Islanders are voted
“sweetly interesting”; Malay head-hunters
are act altogether contemned. Now comes
tlie news (London Daily Mail, 17/l/’08)
C'lt a full-blooded Red Indian, by name
\ rate Cloud (the fact that he possesses no
other name has already caused infinite
confusion), has been cited as co-respond-
ent in the Greene v. Greene divorce case.
Broadly speaking, the only darkies the
decadent English damsels haven’t
heaved themselves at during the past
decade are the dwarf tree-dossers
who arrived via Cairo from Central
Africa last year. But these had their
wives with them, and, being valuable
show exhibits, were guarded like the star
inmates of a zoo, so they hardly count.
If they had been running loose and grazing
in the open like Mr. W. Cloud, there is no saying
what might have happened.

The Melbourne Master Undertakers' Asso-
ciation and the Undertakers’ Union are co-opera-
ting with the Council of Churches, and endeavor-
ing to get the Yic. Chief Secretary to suppress
Sunday burial. But it’s difficult to see how he is
going to do it unless he can stop Friday death.
If a law were passed prohibiting Sunday inter-
ment it would often mean a ghastly hurry
to get the “departed” underground before
Saturday evening, ora still more awful scramble
to get him planted deep and early on Monday
morning. Of course the undertaker deserves one
day’s rest from his dreadful trade, if he can get it.
And if the Sunday funeral could be suppressed it
would be a blessed repression of the Sunday tomb-
stone loafer, who throngs God’s acre on the after-
noon of the Day of Rest, and takes an interest in
the long black box that encloses some dead
stranger, and crowds round the dismal mourning
coaches when the cortege halts at the gate, and
presses up close to the graveside when the clods
thud on the coffin-lid. If burials only took place
on days when this morbid person was hustling for
his crust, it would be a good thing. But Friday
death is in the way.

The Bank of N. S. Wales, the first estab-
lished in Australia, has just sent a unique souvenir
round among its staff. Mostly it consists of repro-
duced photos of all the Bank’s offices, as they
were in the beginning of things and as
they are now; and along with this album
are facsimiles of all the notes, etc., the bank
has ever issued. Sergeant Jeremiah Murphy*
of the 4th Regiment, it seems, was the
bank s first depositor. He was sitting on the
doorstep with his £5O when the premises opened
at Mrs. Mary Reibey’s house in Macquarie-plaee,
Sydney, on April 8, .1817. Though the bank has »
picture of most of its early-day premises, it ha*
none of Mrs. Mary Reibey’s house, and no amount
of searching has uneartked one. It stayed w
Macquarie-place for about five years, and then
moved into George-street. After Jeremiah
Murphy had dropped in his £5O, John Harris, 0
Ultimo, came along with £l3B Is. 4d.; after him
Wm. Redfern, with £5l 15s. 7d. All this access ot
wealth made the Bank of N. S. Wales nervous l
so as soon as possible it sent an order to En£*
land—
One brass-barrelled Blunderbuss, with spring Bay oo ® l '
One case of Horse Pistols, also brass barrels with spri s
Bayonets. ,
One Bulletin,iouW and some Flints.
The subscribed! capital at this time was £12,600 r
but the business was actually started on a paid' u F
capital of £3025. On the whole, it ign’t surprise
that when you wanted an advance of any sort J
had to give three days’ notice.
THE ODOR OF SANCTITY.

set down as “ C H O.”
Sing a song of a brimstone-smell, the curate and the
vicar,
And the chap that toils at the big church bell with a
hand on his lazy ticker !
Sing a song of a church crowd, fit
To drown the perfume of the Pit
With scented frill and handkercher, and hair-oils, violet-
laden,
To burnish the reverends’ forehead-fur, and the locks of
the singing maiden.
Sing a song of a holy smell, of the vestry-man plate-
humping—
The stout suburbanite, living well on his job of ribbon
lumping,
Who did great deeds at breakfast—he
Loves onions, gravied heavily ;
And, as he trots on the track of cash—cash-taking is his
passion !
A heavenly hint of morning basil surrounds him, halo-
fashion.
Sing a song of a churchy smell, and a whiff from the
double-chiuner
Who smokes good weeds. You cannot tell the saint from
the perfumed sinner !
The lavendered fan, and the fierce bouquet
Of sanctified musk and new-mown hay,
The perfume of Sunday boots and the different kinds of
pink cheek lacquers—
Id’s an odor of striking hues you sniff in the haunts of the
heavenly trackers !

The usual weekly claimant to aristocratic
birth and immense quantities of old-world wealth
occurred ons/3/’oBinSydney. This claimant’s name
is Mrs. Alexander Albion. She is in her nine-
tieth year (“There are no words,” observes
Sydney Star brokenly, “in the English language
which contain such unutterable sadness as the
words ‘ Too late ’ ”), and is an inmate of the Coast
Hospital. The glamor of Debrett is over her.
“‘The late Queen Victoria’” (the Star again),
“to use the old lady’s own words, ‘baroneted
brother William over 30 years ago.’ ” She ran
away from “Whitley’s Hill, Ireland,” the ancestral
. mansion which had been erected by someone
at a “ cost of a million and a half to memorise the
family name,” with Albion, a humble carpenter.
Then Albion ran away from her, and she became
a cook in the home of a member of the local
nobility. Here she learned to smoke. “Ah!”
laughed the old plutocrat to a newspaper man.
“It’s one of the few joys I have. I love my pipe. ’
The “Peerages” make no reference to Baronet Wil-
liam, nor is there any mention in these absorbing
volumes of anyone named Whitley either in Ire-
land or elsewhere. The newly-found heiress has
definitely announced her intention of sticking to
the Coast Hospital, and her old-age pension of
£2 3s. 4d. a month “till the Master comes for
her.”

THE HEARTLESS GIRL : “ Yes, that’s the draw-

simply nil. I have a vivid recollection of one
great historical event being trotted out on t e
occasion of the presentation of a dishcloth, or
something, to the Blankyeth Regiment som
little time back. It ran: “Garrisoning Hyde
Park at the time of the attempt on the
life of the Duke of Edinburgh. Of course,
whether the remembrance of this glorious exploit
should stand in the way of compulsory mi 1 ary
service or not, is another matter.
King Edward has, according to report,
ordered that steel traps are no longer to be used
for catching rabbits at Richmond Park. His
Majesty is said to have done this from motives of
humanity. So we may next hear that King
Edward objects to trapped pigeons being shot,
and hares and foxes killed by inches. A fashion-
able English way of getting a fox out of his hole
is to bore down upon him with a metal auger, and
when it has got firmly tangled in bis fur, to draw
him out like a cork from a bottle —unless the skin
comes away.
A Brisbane man has discovered a new use
for his dog. He was standing outside a pub the

After a while he introduced the dog into the
argument. He swung Fido round at the end of
the rope, and belted the sharer of his sorrows
with him, the dog meanwhile adding to the
gaiety of the affair by yelping like the pack of
new J’s.P. after Kidson had cancelled their ap-
pointments.

The cable has been working the Zakka
Khel expedition for all it is worth in this dull
season. It looks a. contemptible business, on the
face of it, to employ an entire
division, over 10,000 strong,
to crush a petty highland
elan that can’t muster 4000
men at most, avowedly be-
cause some of the young hot-
heads of the clan have done a
little cattle-lifting in the
lowlands. It would be inter-
esting to know whether they
have really been doing any
business in the way of collect-
ing arms and troop-horses in
the Peshawur and Nowshera
cantonments. That used to be
a thriving industry. The
British army rifle of the period
has usually sold in the hills for
its weight in rupees, and no
questions asked. The arms of
a guard, piled in front of a guard-
house, have actually been stolen
under the sentry’s nose. Company
arm-chestis, with all the spare arms,
have been lifted bodily over the
color-sergeant as he lay asleep on his
cot, on a hot night, with the door
open. (At least, he always said so,
and there was no proof to the con-
trary.) A.rms, always the best and
newest, ha.ve been stolen by hundreds
and thousands out of barracks. If
the Indian Government would extend
its frontier to include the valleys of
these clans, the clans would welcome
the security and order. Now they are
between the hammer and the anvil,
between the British and the Amir of
Cabul. The strip of hill country is a
s butter against the Amir ; it is also a practice
Aground for farm-burners to keep their hands
in and it affords opportunities for Kitchener
to test newly-invented “organisations.” What
a solemn farce it all is !

a clairvoyant is assisting by revealing the horrid
details of the crime. Thus the yarn of the crystal-
gazing person at the Ballarat Alfred Hall, one
Saturday night recently:
I can see “ Madge ” meeting a man at 8.30 at night, and
proceeding with him to the neighborhood of a slaughter-
yard They talked excitedly. The woman had money
in her stocking. The woman said, “ I want my money ;
you have not treated me fairly.” The man, during the
argument, drew a bottle of beer from his pocket and
struck the woman on the head. The blow staggered her.
Shp fell within five or six yards of a hole, and whilst the
breath was still in her body she was hurled to the bottom
of the hole, where she lived for 20 minutes. She had
previously taken her shoe off, as she suffered from a foot
trouble. The man threw the shoe and hat down the hole.
The time was 9.15 at night. The person guilty of the
deed is a tall man, who stoops, and his right leg seems
to be hurt. The woman had over £7 in her possession,
which the man took, together with certain articles of
iewellery. The murderer left a city in a large boat bear-
inir a long name beginning with the letter M, sgid he is
now in Montreal, Canada. He left with £4O in his posses-
sion. , ,
Then every blessed ’tec. told every other blessed
J tec. that curiously enough the story exactly fitted
his own secret theory of the crime. On that point
they were practically unanimous, and their
unanimity was surprising.
It is pleasing to note that the price of a
Sydney child hasn’t got down to the Melbourne
level, though the Sydney figure is shamefully low.
A Sydney court last week, in the ease of Cecilia
The horrible Melbourne Court assessed the cases
of two infants who were starved or otherwise done
to death at £1 each and costs, and as regards four
other dead children the Victorian Law charged
nothing at all.
From The Bulletin’s “Oldest Soldier” :
The cable-man changes his views of things, He began
a while ago with “a punitive expedition against the
Zakka Khels to test the new organisation*” Then he re-
ported some one-horse “ victories,” and, finally, the
storming of some “heights” and destruction of some
towers, with the killing of a British major and the
wounding of ten sepoys. Then came this significant
little paragraph: “The enemy, on being
clung to the rear flanks of the retiring British force, buv
tiiey made no impression,” It was a plain intimation
that the British force, which went into the fight more
than twice as strong in numbers as the Zakka Khels, re-
tired before them, and was pursued. It is a standing
rule in war with Asiatics never, under any circumstances,
to retire till you have'beaten the enemy to a standstill,
and, when the fighting has once begun, never to treat for
peace till the Asiatic has put up his hands. It’s the
only safe and the only humane way, if it is really neces-
sary to fight these wild Pathan clans, to give them a
thorough beating, allow them to rest till they can no
longer come up to time, and then let bygones be bygones
and make friends. After the British retirement came a
world of slush—yet significant slush nevertheless. Some
“friendly Afridis” offered their “mediation”; the
British Government protested that it didn’t propose to
take over the Zakka Khel country ; and, finally, the
Zakka Khel “ chiefs ” are reported to have gone into the
British camp. As a matter of fact, there are no chiefs in
these little Pathan clans. The village elders govern the
village, but are liable to be overruled by some holy man
like the Akhund of Swat, and the young bloods are apt to
set them at defiance and go a-raiding over the border.
That, indeed, is the beginning of most Indian frontier
rows.

A characteristic American horror was that
at Cleveland (Ohio), last week. In a six-storeyed
school building 360 kids were packed. Fire
broke out, and the building was “old and badly-
constructed,” and there were no adequate fire-
fighting appliances, and half of the little
ones were roasted to death. This sort of
thing is more likely to happen in America
than anywhere else because in the mad hustle
for the dollars most other considerations
of life are forgotten ; and because the nigger
problem has brought estimates of the value of
human life down a good deal. The precautions
against disaster, on railroads and steamboats, in
buildings and streets, are probably less in the
great United States of America than in
any other civilised land on earth ; and
that’s not a healthy national sign. More-
over the great American muddle does a
lot to make life hazardous in the U.S. The
American is a swift muddler, a breezy, hustling
muddler, an energetic and original and enthu-
siastic muddler, but a muddler all the time. And
his muddle prevents quite a number of his muddles
coming to the surface. For instance the slaughter
of nearly 200 children would make a ripple on the
surface of the death statistics of most countries,
but the U.S. gets out of that by having no official
death statistics. There are odd records for cities,
counties and districts, and there are guesses here
and there, but there are no complete official
records. Even Bulgaria does better than that.
A South Sea Island skipper, early in this
year, stumbled over what looks like the tail end
of a romance, but it was a strangely reticent tail
and refused to give any particulars. The dis-
coverer (Captain Malcolm, of the schooner Laurel),
while lying at anchor at Apaniama, in the Gilbert
Group, oil January 18th, noticed the masts
of a schooner. From its position he con-
cluded it was either stranded or anchored,
so, in company with his engineer, he went round
in the ship’s launch to investigate. The strange
craft proved to be an American-built sclvdoner of
about 120 tons, and it was so far up on the reef
that it might just as well have been in the interior.
The engineer started to wade to the ruin, but was
met half-way by two boys. He inquired for the
captain, and was informed by the elder of the two
that he was in charge. A further inquiry as to the
whereaboutsof therest of thecrew was received with
embarrassment and indefinite answers. The
engineer then offered any help in his power, but
the two lads, with the wrecked ship behind them,
declined, and stood silently waiting for him to
depart. He thereupon dragged himself together,
and waded back to the launch. Two days later
the two mysteries dropped in on Captain
Malcolm and suggested that he should take them
on to Fiji, but as the native magistrate at
Apamama had warned him to keep his boathook
out of the business he refused. 'The shipwrecked
pair introduced themselves as J. Taylor, of Man-
chester (aged 24), and G. Jackson, of London
(aged 19). Captain Malcolm reminded them that
their vessel had no visible name, and J. Taylor,
of Manchester, replied in a rather hesitating way,
“We were going to call her the White Rose.
She used to be called the Puelche, of Valparaiso.
We left there on October 10th.” Asked later on
if he had a register, Taylor said the late owner of
the ship had refused to part with it. Captain
Malcolm said “Oh !” and inquired if they had a
clearance. Taylor once more replied “No,” and
the captain again said “Oh!’ and, after the un-
accountable couple had let slip the information that
they hadn’t the remotest idea of their whereabouts
or what the name of the island was, or even what
group it belonged to, the interview terminated.
Something should come of the story later on.

Bishop Armstrong, of Wangumtta (Vic.),
who seems to have powers that no other Aus-
tralian Gaiters possesses, lately dismissed Rev,
George Gladstone from his charge because the
out-spoken shepherd didn’t possess the knack of
attracting “people in leading positions. .Now
he has struck another patch of trouble at Alexan-
dra. For a long while past, the vicar m charge
at that point (Rev. E. H. Scott) hasn t been too
friendly with his Board of Guardians, and it is
asserted that Bishop Armstrong, before he left on
his first-class saloon pilgrimage to the Holy Land,
gave Rev. Scott some sort of notice. Last week,
an Archdeacon, after havihg cancelled Rev. Scott’s
license to attract people in leading positions,
hurried Up to Alexandra and found the church
shut tight. The vicar, when the dignitary from
town called, refused absolutely to have anything
to say to him. All this time excitement was
working up to fever point, for Alexandra is a
small mountain town with nothing much to do,
and when a rumor floated round that the Arch-
deacon was going to break open the church, and
conduct divine service with an axe in one hand
and splinters all over him, quite a crowd of
people turned up to witness the performance.
The cleric from town, however, contented him-
self with the shire hall, where he gave two per-
formances to large audiences on the succeeding
Sunday. The Rev. Scott conducted morning and
evening service at the vicarage, and was well
patronised. The present position is that the
church remains locked up, and the local thi ippence
is evenly divided in the centre. Meanwhile, a
third, or fourth, or tenth horrible row in Victorian
Anglican circles centres round Rev. lay lor, of
St Johns, Ballarat, who, it is said, isn t “ a good
dresser” His pants haven’t the beautiful crease
which is the only road to heaven, and his tail-coat
doesn’t hang in the perfect style of salvation.
This glaring and childish worldliness among
people who regard themselves as of the elect is
calculated to make a real man turn atheist. It is
sickening to find that a vicar is expected to be a
bobbing, grovelling shopwalker or clothes-horse.

The Victorian Supreme Court has author-
ised the sale of an historic site in Melbourne
under the will of James Butchart, of the old-time
firm of Kaye and Butchart, stock salesmen, who
died many years ago. The property has a frontage
of 79ft 9Ain. to Bourke-street, with a depth ot
315 ft to Little Bourke-street, to which there is a
frontage of 123 ft. 9in. On a part of the property
stands Kirk’s Bazaar. This ancient horsey insti-
tution was founded in 1849 by a Scot, James
Bowie Kirk, and an Irishman, John Barlin,
farmers on the Plenty. Harlin did not retain his
interest long, as he preferred his farm, but Kirk
held on, and in the roaring days of gold made an
immense fortune. The place has had many
tenants since— amongst the rest George Watson.
Under the clock in Watson’s time the first betting
rincr was started. Tom Coker, Goyder, Boole
J J Miller (Adams’s precursor in the matter ot
sweeps), Polak, and a little Hebrew fish-hawker,
whose name this scribe forgets, were the first
pencillers. _____

THE WILD CAL
COLUMN
Apart from Commonwealth refunds—mainly
Customs duties—Australian revenue collections are on
the turn. In N. S. Wales the railways, for instance, gave
±‘1422 less for February than for the same month last
year, in spite of the fact that this February was a day
longer ip wearing itself out. Queensland railways earned
£7539 less, and those -of Victoria £45,399 less. Some of
the reduction has been due to cuts in freight charges,
but the closing of mines on account of the fall in metal
prices has laid up many a railway truck. During the
early part of the month pastoral prospects w'ere also
gloomy ; but rain has fallen, and the hogget can get a
drink again. Here, however, are the month’s totals :
State Revenues for February.
1907. 1908.
N. S. Wales.. ..£1,051,478 £1,047,913 Dec. £3,565

Westralia .. .. 261,688 270,745 Inc. 9,057
Tasmania .. .. 68,016 80,912 Inc. 12,896
Victoria shows a big increase ; but if it hadn’t been for
the Commonwealth refunds, Bent would have been
£36,780 to the bad compared with last year, and N. S.
Wales would have been £45,890 the same way. Treasurer
Waddell (N.S.W.), talking up-country a few days ago,
hung the responsibility around the neck of the land and
income taxes—the former transferred to the shires, the
latter cut down to the bone. As a matter of fact, how-
ever, land and income taxes only made a difference on
the month, as compared with last year, of £3412.
The complete figures for the financial year, so
far as they are available, make up the next table :
State Revenues for Year so Far.
1906-7. 1907-8.
N. S. Wales (Bmos.) £8,708,481 £9,411,711 Inc. £703,230
Victoria ( ~ ) 5,309,129 5,632,641 Inc. 323,512

S. Australia (6 ~ ) 1,313,864 1,670,265 Inc. 356,401
The Commonwealth refunds save the situation all round.
The collections have amounted for eight months to
£8,059,305, as against £6,520,633 for the same two-thirds
of the previous year. N. S. Wales has received net
£614,274 of the increase ; apart from that, the State’s
increase in revenue has amounted to only £88,936, about
two thirds of which is mopped up in interest on
new works, working expenditure on new railways,
etc. The chief purpose of the new tariff isn’t
to bring in revenue, certainly; but it comes in
handy even for that. Revenue is a sort of by-product ;
and it is a mighty lucky industry in which the by-product
is worth so much money. Still this aspect of the matter
fs carefully suppressed by the Foreign-trade crowd. It
groans that the people will have to pay vast sums, and it
leaves the matter at that —apparently the idea is that there
is some monster in a kennel in the Customs back-yard
which chews up the money. And there isn’t any monster
at all. On the contrary, while Wade is cursing the
Commonwealth, the Commonwealth is handing this
money over to Wade’s Treasurer, and providing him with
the surplus on account of which he is throwing out his
chest. Including the transfer to the Public Works Fund,
the expenditure for the eight months has been £8,768.414,
so the surplus to February 29 was £643,297. Therefore,
but for the increase in the Customs collections and in the
Commonwealth refunds, N. S. Wales, instead of having a
surplus of £643,297, would actually have one of only
£29,023.
Expenditure figures come from 'only three
States: —
State Expenditure for Year so Far.
1906-7. 1907-8.
N. S. Wales(B mos.).. £7,865,634 £7,935,005 Inc. £69,371
Queensland! „ ).. 2,328,708 2,502,748 Inc. 174,040
Westralia ( „ ).. 2,199,765 2,108,450 Dec. 91,315
The N. S. Wales expenditure in this comparison does not
include the payments to the Public Works Fund. Out of
that fund payments are made for the renewal and replace-
ment of buildings, and for some of the non-productive
works which ought always and altogether to be paid for
out of revenue. All this expenditure ought to be re-
garded as “ordinary.” The existence of the fund is,
however, an easy way of creating a bogus surplus, to
be used in paying for things that would have to be paid
foranvhow. There is room for a Public Works Fund—a fund
to pay for such reproductive public works as have hitherto
been paid for out of loans ; but, instead of cutting down
the State’s pawning, Wade and Waddell have already
this year spent £1,347,760 of borrowed money, or at the
rate of £2,021,640 a year, as against £903,067 for the
corresponding part of last year. Per head of the popula-
tion, Federal Statist Knibbs showed, the other day, that
N. S. Wales was now paying £3 4s. lid. of taxation a year,
as against £1 19s. Id. in 1900. In other words, allowing
for increase in expenses over which they have no control,
Wade and Waddell, the Reformers, have about £1 2s. 6d.
per head, or very nearly £2,000,000 per annum, more
money at disposal than was available in 1900 ; yet thev
borrow at the rate of over £2,000,000 a year, and still go
on wearing the halo of financial Reformers ! Altogether,
the gentleman who has the philanthropic uncle in Fiji
couldn’t do anything more emphatic in the way of a con-
fidence trick than that..
Queensland Auditor-General Connah has made
a special report to Parliament concerning the unau-
thorised expenditure of money by Temporary Premier
Philp, after the Assembly had refused him Supply and
passed six votes of no-confidence. He says that, as the
result of an Executive minute, certain warrants
were presented to him (the Auditor-General) for
signature by the then Treasurer, but he refused
to sign them. “The warrants,” continues the
Auditor-General, “were subsequently signed by the
Governor, on the advice of the Treasurer, who disbursed,
under Section 12 of the Audit Act, a portion of the
moneys under these warrants in the same manner as if an
Appropriation Act had been passed.” It helps to show'
how- desperately the Tory crowd hung to the wreck. The
warrarjts thus signed by the Governor, on the refusal of
the Auditor-General to put his name to them, included
£550,000 drawn on the Consolidated Revenue Fund,
£200,000 on the Loan Fund, and £25,000 on the Trust
Fund. Queensland’s Bill against Philp, and his handv-
man at Government House, therefore amounts to £775,000.
* * * *
In spite of a further reduction in the Bank of
England discount rate, there doesn’t appear to be much
faith that business is going to be very brisk again in either
Europe or America. Hence the wool-buyers in Australia
have received instructions to go very slow; and at
the Sidney sales of the last week or two the market
has been flabbier than at any time since 1900.
* * * *
Cutting out the Town Hall and the electric
lighting works, the trading concerns of the Sydney City
Council, including markets, baths, resumptions, sale-
yards, etc., show a net credit balance of £8456, if the
finance committee’s annual report correctly states the
situation. The Town Hall, which isn’t strictly a trading
concern, is about £13,672 to the bad, and the organ
another £1044. The electric light works are a separate
business, which is only just getting into its stride ; yet,
after providing for sinking fund and depreciation (though
most likely not enough depreciation), the profit and loss
account opened, on Jan. 1 this year, with a debit of only
£l3O8 —a reduction, on the committee’s showing, of
£8244 for the year.

In 1897 nearly a million and a half went up in flame and
smoke on one night in Melbourne, starting at Craig-
Williamson’s, and of the £750,000 lost by the insurance
offices, the little Standard had to pay a bit more than its
share. Since then it has had a run of good luck, or a run
of good luck and good management; so that, besides pay-
ing highly-satisfactory dividends, it has added over
£50,000 to its reserves in 10 years. It is a case, however,
where large reserves are called for, because the paid capi-
tal is only £75,000, leaving shareholders liable in case of
disaster for no less than £925,000. In other words, the
£lO shares are paid up to only 15s. The business shows
steady, but not rapid, expansion :

The capital and reserves combined total £162,386, or
272 per cent, of the net premiums. This is an excellent
position from the clients’ point of view. For the
extent of the risks held by a co. can only be gauged
by the amount of its premium income ; and obviously
the larger the funds in proportion to premium income
the better prepared a co. is to meet the risks supposing
they become claims. On the average the British offices’
proportion of funds to premium income is 152 per cent.;
so the Standard’s position is very nearly 50 per cent,
stronger than that. No doubt there are reserves and re-
serves—reserves that exist only on paper and reserves
that are worth 20s. in the £. In this case, the assets are
at any rate very profitable ; the 'investments appear to
bring in an average of about £4 7s. 6d. per cent. There
is obviously not much profitless paper in that lot. Still
there are two doubtful features : first, 45 per cent, of the
assets are advances on mortgage, and in Maoriland that
means risk (also in case of trouble the money can’t be got
in quickly) ; and secondly, £43,902 is described as held in
debentures, and that is a trifle too vague for practical
purposes.

The present run of 10 per cent, dividends began in 1900 ;
for some years before that, 9 per cent, was paid. The co.
carries a heavy responsibility on its shoulders; its de-
posits (with interest) amount to £263,009, and practically
the whole of that, as well as the shareholders’ own funds,
is invested in mortgages. These latter, along with small
freeholds, etc., amount to £351,921. Thus the eo.’s
funds have to protect an investment very nearly 3}
times greater than the funds themselves ; the share-
holders risk not only their own money in mortgages, etc.,
but £253,924 of other people’s money, for which they are
responsible. During the past year the form of the pub-
lished accounts has been altered. Previously the profit
and loss account showed on one side the total amount
received by way of interest; on the other, the outgoing
interest on deposits. This year the statement merely
shows the balance on interest account. On the data of
previous years it appears that the interest received was
between 5| and 6 per cent, on the average ; and a return
of that size suggests inflation. Maoriland has been
borrowing tremendously. From £39,635,032 in 1895 the
net public debt whirled along to £61,276,542 in 1907; and in
the same period the local bodies’ debt, excluding Govern-
ment loans, rushed from £6,685,510 to £10,718,051. In 12
years over £l2 per head has been added to the public
debt, which (apart from local debt) now amounts net to
£67 Is. per head. That sort of thing must stop some
time. For these years pasta fictitious prosperity, with
accompanying inflated values, has been produced'; when
the flood of borrowed money stops, a slump in those
values is almost certain. And the chances are that the
flow will stop just when other unfavorable conditions
are at work, so that the slump will be all the greater.
These are the possibilities that this co. has to face. It
may be requiring large margins when it makes advances ;
so it is conceivable that it won’t lose a penny when the
trouble arrives. But the man who relies on that is likely
to be saving up trouble for himself. The depositors
probably needn’t worry. Apart from the paid capital
and the reserves, there is £50,000 of uncalled capital ;
and, in view of that liability, the fairly rapid accumula-
tion of reserves must be grateful and comforting to
shareholders. On figures, the position has certainly im-
proved in this respect. Thus :
Deposits, etc. Advances, etc. Reserves.
1902 .. £262,156 £338,029 £31,632
1907 .. 264,855 351,921 47,997
So, in 1902, the reserves were equal to onlv 12 per cent,
of the deposits, while now they are equal to 18 per cent.;
and that, of course, is so much extra protection, not only
for the depositors, but for the shareholders’ capital as
well.

The shareholders, six months ago, voted £lOOO to the
family of the late Laidley Mart, who for 24 years had
been chairman of the co.; and this amount has come out
of the past half-year’s net profits, reducing them to the
amount shown above. The reserves move about without
explanation ; possibly these unexplained jumps have
some connection with uncompleted contracts. Follow-
ing only the profit and loss account, these would be the
profits for recent terms :
June, 1902 .. .. £4410 June, 1905 .. .. £5201

June, 1904 .. .. 4868 June, 1907 .. .. 7949
Dec., 1904.. .. 6169 Dec., 1907.. .. 8482
Things are certainly looking up. In fact, there have been
larger aggregate additions to the reserves during the past
18 months than there had been for the previous seven
years. At Dec., 1899, the co.’s reserves were £22,637, and
as at June, 1905, they had been increased by £7594 ; while
in the past 18 months the increase has amounted to
£8799. Certainly the co. does not nowadays show how
much profit it writes off to cover depreciation (which,
in a case of this sort, means mostly the amount spent
on renewals); but, assuming that as much is being pro-
vided now as was provided a few years ago, the net profit
figures are cheerful. They amount to nothing very good
even now ; a prosperous softgoods importing house would
look down upon them with scorn. But if Mort’s Dock
goes on like this, capitalists will presently be encouraged
to put money into Australian industrial concerns : where-
as hitherto it has called for a lot of nerve to do that. The
capital is £150,000 in ordinary shares (in the old days
£30,000 of this was paid up out of accumulated reserves);
£50,000 non-cumulative 0 per cent. pref. shares, issued
mainly to carry out the Woolwich Dock ; and £150,000
(reduced to £148,300) of debentures, of which £50,000 was
also issued to help pay for the big dock.

The Shamrock was one of the six breweries that were
hooped up into one combine iast year ; and the new con-
cern took over the business as from July 1. The present
accounts more or less show, therefore, the results of seven
months’ trading under the old, and six months’ trading
under the new conditions. Under the old conditions,
there was a balance from working account of £3301 ; but
the general expenses for the year amount to £4853. Cer-
tainly the whole of these expenses cannot be charged
against the seven months’ operations ; but the great bulk
of the expenses no doubt belong to that period, so it looks
as though there was no profit at that time. The combine
(officially known as the Carlton and United Breweries
Proprietary Ltd.) took over the Shamrock brewery, and
paid the Shamrock Co. £2175 as its share of the profits for
the half-year. As the Shamrock’s interest in the combine
is nominally £72,500, the dividend was at the rate of
6 per cent, per annum., The Shamrock was to have one-
tenth interest in the combine ; therefore, presumably,
the total profit distributed for the half-year was £21,750,
divided as follows:—
Carlton .. .. .. 40 per cent. = £B7OO
McCracken's .. ..18 ~ ~ 3915
Castlemaine 12 • ~ ~ 2610
Shamrock .. .. ..10 ~ ~ 2175
Victoria 10 ~ ~ 2175
Foster’s 10 ~ ~ 2175
100 £21,750
This is on the assumption that the capital was cut up as
reported at the brewery meetings on June 5 last. For
book-keeping purposes the Shamrock reckons the £72,500
of combine stock as an asset at face value, and on the
other side shows “Assets realisation account, to provide
for depreciation, £58,000.” Apparently that is the pro-
portion of the £72,500 represented by the transferred
goodwill of the Shamrock business —the balance consisted
of rolling stock, certain plant, etc. The brewery, hotel
properties, etc., are not transferred ; the combine leases
part of the former, and has certain rights to secure the
latter. Assuming that the combine can pay 6 per cent,
per annum on its capital, the Shamrock’s proportion will
be equal to 9J per cent, on its own capital. It will,
besides that, have its own assets, and on the other hand
will have its own expenditure. But as to the prospects of
the combine paying 6 per cent, on £725,000 there is no in-
formation. In Sydney, Tooth’s pay 10 per cent, on
£900,000 and Toohey’s 5 per cent, on £400,000, but, then,
they have large revenues from hotel properties.

Like most of these cos., this one has had an erratic
career, though in the past 10 years dividends appear to
have been regularly forthcoming except in 1898 and 1904.
Besides its share capital, now amounting to £168,399,
.there are £167,000 of 5 per cent, debentures outstanding ;
and the interest on that lpt represents a large
bite out of profits in poor years. In addition
to the amounts shown above as written off, large
sums are paid for renewals and replacements, and
charged direct to profit and 1055—£15,033 in 1906 and
£14,720 in 1907. Apart from that, however, there appears
to be no writing down except as shown ; and even of the
£17,500 written off for the past year £7500 is spent on the
renewal of buildings. The property, plant, etc., has a
book value of no less than £369,699. These assets are
mostly of a perishable sort, and wear and tear is there-
fore heavy and persistent. It is not only the assets repre-
sented by the share capital that depreciate: the assets
represented by the debentures go the same way just as
fast. Consequently the amount written off must con-
tinue to be larger than the size of the share capital would
suggest. Apart from debentures the liabilities are not
large, and are practically covered by consignments, stocks
at the w'orks, etc.

Early in 1902 the capital was reduced from £112,500 to
£lOO,OOO, and assets were written down to match. The
operation shouldn’t have hurt as much as most such
cuts, because in ISSB, during the boom, the co. made a
lucky land sale, and paid up a large amount of capital
with the proceeds. Before writing down capital the divi-
dend (which had been dropped altogether for a few
years) was 3J per cent. Three years later it became
necessary to revalue the stock, and the net profits slumped
partly in consequence. This illustrates the special risk
in an investment of this sort: the outsider can form no
fair opinion as to whether a proper amount is being pro-
vided on account of the mouse that corrupts and the a«-e
that stales and withers ; and if enough isn’t provided then
the statement of profits is all wrong, and there is alarge
scope for depreciation in a stock that runs to £66 323
The co., moreover, has’to struggle with a heavy debt on
premises that are probably much more costly than the

These profits are stated net, after writing off the amounts
taken from the reserves for the renewal of works, etc.
Unfortunately, however, it isn’t merely on account of
extra-large payments out of these reserves that the net-

The trading profit column shows that things are not
goirm too well with the Ballarat co. Not only are things
dull '’in the old goldfield, wherefore the revenue has
shrunk ■ but coal has lately been costly, wherefore the ex-
penditure has done the other thing. Financially, how-
ever, the co. is in a comfortable way, having £16,782 at
its bank at the end of the half-year. Seven years ago the
surplus of liquid assets over liabilities was £19,008 ; it is
now £19,680. The £672 increase is the amount, the co.
has made in the seven years over and above the dividend
and the expenditure on plant-renewals, etc.
It was luck for the Broken Hill Prop, that it
didn’t take credit for all that it was nominally getting for
its zinc concentrates last year, but put aside much money
in the days of high prices to be used in wiping out the
trouble in the da vs when the market should slump and the
co. should find itself heavily overdrawn. In a11£60,000 was
built up in this special reserve ; and, from present appear-
ances, it will probably all be wanted. With 85,373 tons
of product still to be adjusted, £41,459 remains to do the
adjusting; and that amount is officially thought to be
about enough for the doleful job.
The trouble about “placing” the Broken Hill
concentrates is settling itself. Besides Block 10, the Zinc
Corporation and the South Blocks have made a two-years’
contract with the B. H. Prop. ; and the South and North
have made a deal with a German firm, on terms which
make the crude ore worth about 2s. per ton less than
formerly. The cos. are likely to find the marketing of
zinc concentrates a much harder nut to crack later on,
unless a spelter industry is established in Australia.
The Broken Hill Prop, chairman got himself
misunderstood at the half-yearly meeting. “On May
31,” he said, “ there were 2,955,000 tons, since which
312,158 tons have been raised, leaving 2,643,000 tons ; and
the general manager advises that he considers this quan-
tity gives us two years’ full output.” Obviously at
600,000 tons a year, 2,643,000 tons is four and a third
years’ supply. But 50,000 tons a month take some break-
ing out ; for an output of that size it is necessary not
only to have ore, but ore which can be attacked from
many different points. General-manager Delprat’s idea
is that he can turn out 50,000 tons a month for two
years ; after that, unless new levels are opened up, the
output will have to taper off. It is morally certain
that long before two years are past, new levels
will have been opened. The 1400 ft. level has only
just been punctured, and there is 300 ft. of practically
virgin ground above that point. True, the 1400 ft. body
is not at all phenomenal so far as proved ; but it is fairly
high in metal contents, even though it will be a tough
proposition for null-superintendent Hylton. This refers
only to the south end of the mine. The north, or Block
14, end is, on the other hand, apparently a blank or
thereabouts.
Broken Hill mines directed from London have
made a poor show since the metal markets tumbled.
The British is closed down until itis known which way
the cat is going to leap, notwithstanding that it has at
the 800fc. level the finest looking body of ore on the
Barrier. Low working costs have for some time been
the boast of the British management, and with
its present equipment it is more capable than
ever of breaking records in that direction. The
fact appears to be that the British'Co.didn’t like, the
arrangement made with the Miners’ Association, some
time ago, by General-manager Delprat, of the Broken
Hill Prop., and subsequently made an award of the Arbi-
tration Court. That arrangement involved a large in-
crease in wages for a fixed period, which won’t expire till
the end of this year ; so the co. is disposed to dawdle
along in any old way for the present. There is a lot (f
cackle to the effect that employers can be compelled to
obey the awards of an Arbitration Court, but that em-
ployees needn’t. Well, here’s a case that knocks a hole
in that argument.
* * *
The Broken Hill Pinnacles, also London-Owned,
is another awful example of tiresome dalliance. For
three months past the directors have been thinking
whether or not they will erect a wet concentration plant
at the mine, and now they have asked the Mines Depart-
ment for another six months in which to do some more
thinking. It looks as if a lot of this thinking should have
been done before the Elmore plant was installed at the
mine ; in that case the chances are either that it wouldn’t
have been installed at all, or that it would have been
helped out by proper crushing machinery, etc. There is
a probability of the Elmore people having a heated
argument with the owners of the mine before long.
From Cobar (N.S.W.) : Val Farrier, late
manager of the Chesney, takes Woolcock’s place as
underground manager of the Great Cobar, and the men
won’t mind. Woolcock now takes the management of
Cobar, Ltd. (late Young Australian and Mount Pleasant
mines), vice A. E. Strick. Weir, late manager of the Gulf
tin mine, Emmaville, goes to Chesney. General manager
Shallcross, of the Australian Gold Recovery Co., takes
over the colonial representation of the Cobar Gold Mines,
Ltd., in lieu of Thomas Buckland. This large property
can’t possibly move much more slowly than it has done
for the last few years. McCauley succeeds mine-
manager West. The company has, however, just
been granted six months’ partial suspension of labor
conditions, 30 men to he employed. Some of these
men are being used to prospect the surface to the south
of the shaft. All work underground except the diamond
drill is suspended. Cobar people are wondering what has
happened to the new Elmore treatment plant. After
running on and off for a few weeks, it has closed down —
temporarily, so the staff says. Elmore, the inventor of
the process, had a look at it, and then rushed off again
to Broken Hill ; he intends to return in about a fort-
night’s time to experiment or adjust. The Great Cobar
is still slowly putting its new plant together ; but, judg-
ing by the progress already made, it will be some months
yet before we see everything in working order.
* * * *
Queen Bee’s working account for the half-year
to the end of December showed a profit of £1933 but
management, development, depreciation and other
charges brought this plucky little Cobar co. out £9Bl on
the wrong side, notwithstanding that no great amount of
prospecting or development was done (certainly not as
much as will have to be done to maintain the present out-
put), and notwithstanding that the half-year opened with
copper at £BO 10s., as against the present £55 or there-
abouts. Manager Fox still believes in the mine, butp
sees he must work at lower costs ; and that means more
and better plant. The co. hasn’t got the money ;in fact,
it has been working on a small overdraft. He reckons
that £4OOO will provide him with a larger water-jacket
furnace and some other necessaries, and he sets to work
to provide this out. of profit. But it takes a long time to
reach the top of a hill by sliding down it, and that is
about Queen Bee’s position with regard to that £4OOO.

boilers, with mountings, uptakes, funnels, etc., for the
Melbourne Harbor Trust, also a number of dredge
buckets for same Trust; stamper shoes, dies and cams,
heavy and light forgings for mining plants, shipping,
etc. ; also Burning, bolts, nuts, washers, Helyambo scoops,
and every description of contractors’iron work. Amongst
machinery completed is a new hydraulic multiple
punching machine, weighing over 20 tons, and capable of
punching 120 holes in 10 seconds, with a pressure of 520
tons per stroke. This machine will be used in the manu.
facture of 48in. and 54in. diameter pipes for the Melbourne
water supply, a contract for which has been signed.*

When Great Cobar and Chesnev (N.H.W.) were
pushed off, the ore reserves were estimated at 1,530,506
tons; that was in March, 1906. A new estimate was
made as at the end of December, when the ore available
in Great Cobar was .figured at 1,490,000 tons and in
Chesney at 499,000 tons. This excluded 200,000 tons of low-
grade ore near the surface in the big mine. Also the
middle shoot was only included down to 925 ft., though
the connecting drive has more or less proved it at
1000 ft. The drive has proved that it is there,
at any rate, and apparently it is of much higher
grade than the average of the reserves. The mine
lias, therefore, stuck to the co. all right; it is only the
market that has gone back on the new owners, who
bought on the strength of estimates, which figured first
on a market at £B5 per ton, and then, after the new plant
got to work, on a £7O market.
Mt. David (N.S.W.) expects a good clean-up
next time. The levels running south-east from the winch
winze are developing fairly well, though the first dis-
covery of the big reef raised people’s hopes a little too
high. No. 2 level is out 342 ft., with 3ft. of stone carry-
ing gold. This may be followed by No. 3, which has
been driven 171 ft. south-east. But No. 3 is only 50ft.
below No. 2. They are also stoping on sft. of good stone
at this level, and it is the good indications at the bottom
that sustain Mt. Davids in the market. A dividend may
possibly be paid before the half-year is out, as the sinking
of the new shaft and the preparations at the open cut are
being done gradually, and, if the returns are as good as
anticipated, a moderate capital expenditure should not
prevent the payment of a small dividend.

The market valuation of the South Kalgurli
now stands at little more than its local assets. The
management reckons on getting another £60,000 profit
from the ore in sight, and on this basisshares look cheap ;
but it is the danger of the cash resources being frittered
away in speculation that scares investors from dabbling
in Westralian stocks nowadays. In the case of the South
Kalgurli, the chairman told shareholders that nothing of
this sort would be done without their being taken into
the confidence of the Board ; but having once worked the
oracle, those having a controlling interest can tell other
shareholders to either like it or lump it. Cases like this
have happened before in connection with Westralian
mining cos., the purse-strings of which are held in
London.

Shareholders were told at the Boulder Main
Reef meeting that subscriptions had been received for
130,000 shares, and that there was a lot of money still to
come in. Something was also said about the mine’s
chances of getting the tail end of the Boulder shoot in
depth, while the usual yarn about “the good results
obtained in the past ” was also resurrected. The Main
Reef may get the Boulder lode at some point or other
but, if it does, that point will almost for a certainty be
too deep for man to follow it. As for the mine’s past
record, if is not what has been taken out of the cupboard,
but what is left in, that is of any consequence to a hungry
man.

Lake View Consols (W.A.) is looking better at
depth, and there may still be a long life ahead of this
mine. The present mill profit certainly does not promise
much in the way of dividends, but if the management
gets the gold it thinks it will from the re-treatment of
the big residues dump, a few shillings may find their way
into shareholders’ pockets from this source before very
long.

Slimes treatment by the vacuum filter process is
becoming popular in Westralia. Costs range from 2s. 9d.
per ton, where cost of power and superintendence can be
distributed, to 4s. per ton in cases where only the retreat-
ment of residues is being done. It is claimed that the
first cost of a vacuum filter is much less than of a filter
press, and that the working expenses are a bit lower.

Chairman Herman Landau, at the Associated
Northern meeting “ What I have said of the Northern
Blocks applies more or less to all the other Kalgoorlie
mines—that is, that they are approaching an end
as far as can be seen at present. As the formations there
are very peculiar, cropping up in the most unex-
pected places, I would suggest that the Westralian
Government should appoint a Commission, and that that
Commission should have a considerable amount of money
placed at its disposal. It need not necessarily come from
the Westralian Treasury direct, because I venture to
hope that most, if not all, of the mines on that field now
would gladly contribute to such a fund. Surely, having
spent millions on the great industry, the Government
ought not to consider too great a sacrifice to vote, say,
another £lOO,OOO or £200,000 for the purpose of further
developing this very uncertain field, which, like the
widow’s cruse, never seems to be exhausted.” In plain
words, having spent millions to enable the mining cos. to
pocket £17,475,328 in dividends up to the end of 1907, the
Government is coolly asked now to spend a few more
hundreds of thousands for the benefit of the same greedy
crowd of foreigners.
* * * *
“Shareholder” grumbles through the Financial
Times at the directors of the Associated Northern grab-,
bing £4386 in fees, notwithstanding that the mine is
fading fast, and though they are thousands of miles from
the scenes of operations. It is the fault, however, of the
shareholders who stand this sort of thing. The Oroya-
Brown Hill Board is the most impudent of the lot. Its
members have cut up over £9OOO annually for some years
past. Now the output has fallen, yet it wouldn’t be at all
unparalleled if they voted themselves still more, “to
recoup them for the extra attention called for by the
mine.”
# * * *
Golden Pole (W.A.) just manages to keep its
endup. In the half-yearly report to January 31, issued
the other day, the reserves are given as 8262 tons, com-
pared with 8727 tons for the previous half-year ; but as
1512 tons of “ prospective ” reserves were included in the
latter estimate, the mine has really gained a little on the
mill in the interim. Still the present tonnage is a mere
handful when the matter of mine valuation is taken into
account. Future development, which will during the
next six months mainly consist of shaft sinking and
driving the two bottom levels, is, according to the
management, well warranted. Had it simply said “ While
there is life there is hope,” it would probably have better
expressed the situation.
* ♦ * *
The elated local paper reports that two wire
ropes have reached Coolgardie for Bailey’s mine, and the
hope is expressed that before long “ work in an earnest
and legitimate fashion ” will be resumed. Some months
ago it was cabled from London that “ plenty of money”
had been raised, but nothing like a definite statement
has ever been made on the subject, and that is suspicious.
* * * •
Merton’s Reward (W.A.) has put the
shutters up. Twelve months ago the ore in sight was
estimated at 200,000 tons, worth 305., and on these figures
the Government was induced to lay down some eight
miles of pipe line to supply water for crushing purposes.
Then the mill restarted ; and, as returns were much be-
low the estimated average, the ore was picked, and that
hastened the end.
* * * *
Th o Mararoa Co. (W.A.) is a good deal behind
the times. The mine battery, for want of up-to-date
accessories, treats about one-half of what it should. The
compressor plant has become almost impotent as the
result of old age and, with other portions of the
" BCra PP in BT-” There are more
scientific methods of working a mine than jogging along in
a happy-go-lucky way with a mostly decrepit plant, and
running on a grade which cannot be kept up for any
length of time without skimming the cream.
n„u re o it ?w . (most, y wa K es men) of the Garden
Cxully u°. (W.A.) met in dismal conclave at Coolgardie.
the other day, to hear what the liquidator had to offer
. er H*.. Matter explained that the machinery-supply co.
is willing to buy into the mine, and if creditors agree to
this he would be able to pay ss. 6d. in the £ on the
a l? oU '] t ow ' ed ln wages. It was decided to accept this
offer if no better came along, which is unlikely. All this
comes of allowing mining cos. in the West to purchase
plant on the hire system. Then, when things go wrong,
they beckon the time-payment man to cart his goods
away as soon as the wage-earners ask for their money.
The South Gippsland leases have helped the
Queen Margaret Co. (W.A.) to get its head an inch or so
above water and breathe. The Queen Margaret leases
themselves were turned over to tributors, who struck a
patch, and could find nothing* more, so threw the whole
thing* up. The show is, therefore, under suspension ;it
cost the co. £2lO in the last six months. The net profit
on the whole of the co.’s business was £2640, of which
£2376 was paid as a div. But the South Gippsland new
main shaft was charged up to capital account, and
nothing was written off plant ; and the directors’ policy
in both of these respects will take some justifying,
especially seeing that the reserves are set down at only
4000 tons. The surplus of liquid assets over liabilities is
about £3500.

The attempt of Queensland Menzies (W.A.) to
reconstruct has proved a failure. Proposal was to write
down the nominal capital by one half, giving one new
subscribing share for every two shares held in the old co.
Head office is in Brisbane, with a branch office in Perth.
Brisbane folk discreetly held back their applications until
it was seen how Westralian holders responded. But the
tail refused to wag the dog. The Westerners practically
offered to take their fair proportion and no more, and so
the Queenslanders decided to take none at all beyond the
qualification requisite to bring in directors’ fees.

The Whim Well Copper Co., near Roebourne,
on the Nor’-West Coast (W.A.), has marketed 18 ship-
ments of about 100 tons each fora return of £30,563. There
are still about six shipments in transit or awaiting realisa-
tion. Ore shipped is, of course, carefully selected, but a big
dressing plant is now erected, the benefits of which should
be apparent when Chairman Anderson arrives from Lon-
don on a visit of inspection towards the end of March.
Mt. Morgan’s smelting return for February was
448 tons copper and 51520 z. gold. The gold amounted to
just ll£oz. per ton of copper, and there has been a deal
of newspaper writing about the size of those figures. It
is childish, however, to admire Mt. Morgan simply be-
cause its copper contains big gold values. The latter are
the result of the furnace concentration of low-grade
copper ore, carrying 6dwt. or 7dwt. of gold to the ton. The
poorer the ore in copper, the greater the concentration,
and the richer the gold contents of the copper. With an
increase in the quantity of ore to 15,398 tons the extrac-
tion of copper declined to 2'9 per cent. ; still the concen-
tration of gold in blister copper was ll£oz. Mt. Morgan
may in years to come do away with the use of such enor-
mous quantities of ironstone and limestone ; but for the
present the assembling and furnacing of between 60 and
70 tons of material make the cost of producing a ton of
blister copper rather high. Mt. Lyell, which produces
blister copper at something under £4O, has a string of
advantages over the Queensland leviathan. It uses less
material (ore, fluxes and fuel) to a ton of metal, and ob-
tains its supplies at a much cheaper rate. It also econo-
mises in the use of coke. All these things counter-
balance the comparative poverty of its ore.

The Etheridge Railway is being once more
pushed on, and is being taken in a direct line to the
Einasleigh copper mine, from which it will go on
to Charleston. Whereat there is a noise from the
direction of Georgetown. The authorities are nevertheless
quite right. They are out for traffic ; what Georgetown
is out for is merely a railway. Georgetown people do not
object to the line going to Einasleigh. They realise that
that district is one of very great promise. Money
has been put up for the development of the big copper
lode ; there has been no boosting, no advertising, no
jobbing—just quiet, harmonious, sound development. The
railway to meet its requirements is, then, justified. But
what Georgetown is wild about is that, having taken the
line south to catch the Einasleigh traffic, it will remain
in the south, and have Charleston for a terminus instead
of Georgetown. Georgetown may be entitled to many
things, but a railway at the expense of more promising
districts is not necessarily one of them.

Great Northern, Gympie (Q.), is doing a lot of
development work on the Empire reef. Results are
pretty good; wherever the necessary conditions are
present, there is gold in the reef. In a rise which is
proving the top break of the Phoenix slates, the quartz is
specimen stone, according to Gympie classification. In
driving north recently at the bottom level, nice coarse
gold has also been obtained. A crushing of at least 100
tons is ready ; it is estimated this will be as good as the
trial crushing. Peter and Paul, in the same district,
started its shaft on Feb. 24 from the grass ; 150 ft. will
prove the Phoenix slates and a reef. Big things are locally
expected from this property. The co. was floated in
Sydney early this year, and is under Sydney management.
The Mitchell River Co. (Q-), formed 15 months
ago to work a very big gold-antimony show in one of the
wildest parts of the North, has held its first annual meet-
ing at Cairns. The co. has the local rights to a new pro-
cess evolved by the McArthurs, of Glasgow, the chemical
people who made a success of the cyanide process ; and
most of the 12 months has been spent getting the plant
fixed. It has been a tiresome job, as tracks had first to
be cut; but good progress has been made, and the
McArthurs’ representative, Topie, who acts as general
manager, is now on the mine. At January 10, when the
co.’s year closed, there was £7560 in hand, which was
reckoned ample to carry the co. to the point of
production. How the new process will pan out
in practice remains to be seen ; if the results
come up to those reported from McArthurs’ works in
Glasgow, where bulk samples were treated, there is a big
thing ahead, in spite of the severe fall in antimony. It is
one thing, however, to carry out such processes in a well-
equipped chemical works, with cheap, skilled labor, and
quite another to' tackle therti in the wilds of North Queens-
land. Still, the venture is one of the most interesting
which Australia has in hand at present.

Asked last week what he thought of O.K. now,
a North Queensland supporter of the stock wired back :
“Opinion about the mine is dnchanged, but know
nothing about the market.” The market has, in fact,
crawled down below 4s. Last month 948 tons gave 63
tons copper, or under 7 per cent. There is now over 200
tons of copper waiting for the season to dry itself a little.
Scanty information gets through nowadays about the
mine ; but ore developments of late don’t appear to have
been extensive. On current operations a profit of about
£l2OO a month is estimated. The trouble is that it takes
over £BOOO to pay sixpence per share.
The coal seam at Mt. Mulligan (N.Q.) is
developing fairly well. The best seam is on top of the
formatum, a,nd shows over sft. of clean coal. John
Moffat, who is backing the concern, has had more leases
pegged out, and practically controls the situation.
* * * *
For the half-year ended February 22 the Vulcan
(N.Q.) crushed 5442 tons for a return of £14,086, an
average value of £2 11s. per ton. Crushing, carting, dry-
ing, bagging and picking cost £5346, equal to 19s. 7.9 d.
per ton. The shaft was sunk and timbered a further 156 ft.
at a cost of £2318. Driving, rising and stoping are given as
having cost £3048, or 11s. 2-sd. per ton ; so the actual
cost of mining and milling was £1 10s. 10’4d. per ton.
surface management and general expenses add an-
other 14s. 9d. per ton, bringing the total up to
£2 ss. 7'4d. per ton. This ignores depreciation.
T ne recent rise in shares was due to the discovery of
good tin behind a head in the western leg, the ore being
worth from 8 to 10 per cent., and some of it better;
but nothing of this appears in the skimpy report.
A rise of a shilling a share means an added
capital value of £13,300, and the best the mine
did, when tin was at its high-water mark, was to pay Is. 6d.
per share on the old issue, equal to threepence on the
present 264,000 shares. Profit and loss shows a debit
balance of £778, but an item, “ Irvinebank Diamond
Drilling shares,” appears in expenditure as costing £2OO,
while as an asset the shares are valued at £5OO. Consider-
ing that the drill has been idle for some months, with no
prospects of its employment, the reason for the estimated
premium of £3OO is hard to discover.

• The Willcocks Cloncurry people expect to have
their smelters running in June; and half-a-dozen little

The Oaks, the new North Queensland gold-
rush, promises to do something interesting. It is going to
take a ballot on the question whether it wants a pub-
license or not, and the Kidston Government will accept
the local-option verdict. At date of last advices the
chances were that the vote would be “No.” The gold
keeps very fine. No nuggets have been found—2oz. is a
big piece. Two or three mullocky leaders are now being
tried with fair results.
What a Godsend the Berry Extended ground
has been to the Spring Hill Leads Co. (Vic.)! Out of 11
parties in wash, 10 are there. The co. just now is getting
18dwt. dirt from this block. That should give about 20s.
per fathom profit. Work is being directed to finding out
if the gutter is making from the Extended into the Spring
Hill lease. Development to the north hardly favors this
theory. All through, the Spring Hill Leads has suffered
because the best part of the gutter has been in the Berry
Extended lease.

Berry United, Creswick (Vic.), wants money,
and it is ready to pay high for it. What it-asks is
£40,000, to be raised by first mortgage debenture stock
issued at par. It offers 6 per cent, interest, with 100 per
cent, bonus on the amount paid up, to come out of the
first net profits. Principal, interest or bonus is not, how-
ever, to be payable until January 31, 1913, or the cessa-
tion of business by the co. Money is wanted for work,
estimated to cost £43,000, to enable a block of the Berry
lead, 1000 ft. long, to be worked, and generally to get the
mine in order. Bewick, Moreing and Co., or their friends,
hold nearly all the scrip, so the appeal is largely formal.
What keeps Victorians out is the cost of management—
they are not educated up to the foreigner’s grand ways.
* * * *
Old Bendigonian Von der Hyde paid calls off
and on into the Virginia (Vic.) for more than 30 years,
and then died before the mine got to its zenith. “ Von ’’
always held that .the management needed shaking up,,
and used to worry old George Lansell to hustle so that
the two of them might taste divs. before they died.
Now, too late, alas ! for “ Von,” Virginia is Bendigo’s top
notcher. But its gait is still leisurely. In the four years
ended Dec. 31 last the co. treated 96,524 tons for 44,6000 z.
That is under 25,000 tons a year—a miserable showing for a
big mine ! Total dividends, £2 9s. 6d. per share. Best
stone comes from the saddle lying between 1800 and 2000 ft.
Quartz is also being beaten out from the saddle between
1200 and 1400 ft., where a very big block will give work
for years. The manager expects new stone within. 100 ft.
below 2080 ft. If he gets it the battery power should be
increased to smash out the reefs quickly. Virginia shares
are in very few' hands, the bulk being held by the
Lansell, Mueller, and Dyason crowd.

Bethanga (Vic.) was the pet worry of J. A.
Wallace, and after he had sunk about £lOO,OOO, he let J.
Bull come in and attempt to make the refractory ore
profitable. Later on the mine was sold up by the
bank, and a Melbourne crowd, including Agar
Wynne and David Syme, bought in. First they at-
tempted smelting. This hasn’t answered. Now Edwards,
of Bendigo, advises a roasting and chlorinating
plant to save not only the gold, but the copper, silver,
and arsenic as secondary products. It is a neat little
scheme ; but will it succeed ? Wallace and Bull both
tried chlorinating, and emptied their pockets. Other
men may, no doubt, have other luck with modern methods.
Sticht and staff at Mt. Lyell have had barely
enough rain of late to water their whisky. This, however,
does not prevent water from flowing at 1000 ft. in the North
Lvell at the rate of 100,000 gallons d.iily. The market
wants to see the result of driving at this point, but
work is singularly slow. So far, developments don’t come
up to expectations respecting the size of the ore body.
The English crowd, which loaded up on diamond-drill
reports, is still trying to even up losses, but the public
won’t feed.
* * * *
The Tasmania, Beaconsfield, is the Speck’s
third big mine. Lyell represents copper, Bischoff tin,
the Tasmania gold. J. Bull, on the advice of Frecheville,
took the Tasmania in hand three years back, intending to
get the water out by installing the biggest pumps in the
Commonwealth. Work has been uphill, for shaft-sinking
has been tedious and water heavy, while other troubles
haven’t made the life of Manager Heathcote a sinecure.
The mine income last year amounted to £130,118, and
ordinary expenditure was £112,455. Reckoned this way
a profit of £17,663 was earned. Depreciation, etc., took
£17,629; and other items in the profit and loss account
raised the year’s debit to £1613. This excludes capital
outlay. Worked out on the basis of mine averages,
it appears that the old holders did right in selling. Their
average was nearly loz. to the ton. Last year 59,000 tons
yielded 30,5120 z.; and even slinging in the 1000 ft. level
west developments, under 45,000 tons of ore is in sight.
What with water, depth, and refractory ore, the future of
the Tasmania looks smudgy.

From “Fred Dowsett,” in the Northern Terri-
tory : “In B. 2/l/’OB, * J.S.P.’ says that, re the West Arm
tinfield, the right sort of European miner is wanted
there. I say there is no employment for the European
miner when he gets there. Two months ago, with eight
others, 1 came to the Territory. Seven of the crowd were
practical miners. We went to the West Arm, and not
one could get a job. We were told by claim-owners and
wages-men alike, that the best thing we could do was to
return to Queensland if we had the passage money. Not
only on the West Arm, but also in Palmerston when we
landed, the question was : ‘ What do you chaps want here?’
We met men—good, upstanding miners—who had been
here since August, and up to the middle of January had
only had five weeks’ work. ‘J.S.P.’s’ par infers that
there is a hotel on the West Arm that supplies all the
luxuries he mentions at £1 per week. There is neither
hotel nor boarding-house on the West Arm, and the only
pub in Palmerston that supplies board and lodging at £1
per week is in the centre of Chinatown. The wages are
not £3 10s., although that amount is paid in a few cases,
but £3 ; and to live so as to keep in health costs at least
£1 ss. to £llos. My mates and I * bached ’ and cut ex-
penses as low as possible, and it cost us just under £1 per
week. Since we have been here every boat has brought
miners up from Queensland, enticed by the reports in the
southern papers ; but they have returned to Queensland
in nearly every case. My mates and I are leaving to-
morrow. Not one of us obtained a minute’s employment
at mining'; and the wet season is now on, so there will be
no hope of a job for another three months at least, and
even then it is doubtful: as one of the claim owners told
us, ‘ You may get a job, but the chances are not worth
waiting for.”’
* * • »
Postmaster - General Mauger’s apology for
slandering the miner doesn’t wipe out his sin against
common sense. Obviously no mine-owner would know-
ingly keep drunkards in his employ at the surface. Ten
thousand times less dare he do so underground. He
doesn’t want his colliery wrecked by an explosion ; he
doesn’t want to fork out damages for some piece of
drunken carelessness ; and he doesn’t want to
weaken discipline. Nor does his deputy, the mine
manager, want any of these things, because he is per-
sonally liable to stand trial if accidents happen through
any carelessness. These obvious things would have been
apparent to anyone but a bigot. Still Mauger’s break is not
without parallel. It is as cheap to say that miners drink
as that they steal gold. Some drink ; so, also, do some
smug tradespeople. , But, as a class, Australian miners
are neither drunkards nor thieves. Manger has to
realise his Ministerial responsibility, and the lesson he is
being taught may help him in that way.

Writer of this paragraph doesn’t know every
miners’ Parliamentary representative in N. S. Wales, but
he knows seven of them, and six of the seven are tee-
totalers. That doesn’t prove anything, certainly; but
it is significant.

Wonders of the Ear.—The wonderful inven-
tion of Dr. C. M. Jordan, the great Aural specialist, has
revived hope in the hearts of the legion of unfortunate
sufferers who for years past have been martyrs to deaf-
ness, head noises, ringing in the ears, discharging ears,
and diseases of the ear generally. The ear, which is the
most fragile of all human organs, had baffled all scientific
thinkers until the advent of the Baroscope, which was
discovered by Dr. C. M. Jordan some 14 or 15 years ago.
This discovery is indeed a boon to humanity, as the
Baroscope is not a chemical treatment, for it contains no
drugs and no electricity. It is, therefore, perfectly
harmless, while it is so effective in its curative power as
to have cured a number of people, some, of whom , had
been proclaimed incurable. This Earoscope treatment
consists of pure natural Aural Kinetics, which is applied
by all sufferers at their own homes, wherever they may
reside. As this treatment is used by one’s self, without
requiring any medical aid, the reader is therefore advised
to write to the Earoscope Institute, 90 Pitt Street,
Sydney, N.S.W., for full particulars concerning this pure
Aural Kinetics and how it should be used for the various
diseases of the ear, all of which will be posted free of
charge on mentioning this paper.*

ABORIGIN
ALITIES
“ Itan ” : The weather prophet is an Aus-
tralian institution. Every ancient or modern
blackfellow will predict with the greatest ease and
at the shortest notice. He usually forebodes
floods, and the deluge is to be the biggest on
record. Then there is the bush naturalist who
gets his authority and guidance from the ants,
which now and again change their abodes, or plug
up their bungalow doors and windows, or do
something else. The man who goes by the cast of
the moon when it comes in gives his prophecy
every month with great weight. Then there is the
barometer fiend and the person with corns or rheu-
matism. The cocky is generally most confident that
rain will soon come, and he shapes his work with
that hope in view, although he does not bother to
look up signs and study insect and other portents.
AMMUNITION.
“Got a bumper on yer , Rags? ”
“ Well, I got er couple , but I'm saving 'em fer
ter-night for the Shining Rockets smoko.”
Now and again in the provinces one strikes a
gloomy chap, who breathes between his pipe and
his teeth the ominous : “ Drought, I think.” It is
seldom, however, that he shows any preparedness
for the desolate time by stacking and storing.
But one man in the N.S.W. west this season
stands out from the group. He has predicted a
bad drought this year. In the latter part of
December he sold out all his sheep and big stock
while they were yet in good condition. Of the
season’s crop he cut some hundreds of tons of hay,
and filled his barns with grain to meet the disastrous
months ahead. If his practical prediction comes
off, the local farmers will venerate the prophet and
envy him his gains ; but if there is plenty of rain
the noise of the laugh against him will wake the
nigger mooning by the muddy shores of Carpen-
taria.
MISUNDERSTOOD.
BLINKRB: “ Wot! Ben , old friend , I ain't seen yer this six munce! Wot yer been doin't”
BEN: “ Nujfink—only the bloomin' old Judge didn't believe me.”
“ Quan ” : A feature of the Queensland
back-blocks is the itinerant teacher. At present
there are three of him, but the number is to be
shortly increased to twelve. The outfit of
Ishmael the pedagogue consists of a buggy, four
horses, complete camping-out equipment, school
requisites, and a boy to look after the team, etc.
Families remote from civilisation are visited, the
children taught for a day or two, and set work for
the teacher’s next coming, frequently a year after,
and then the apostle of education strikes out for
the next family, perhaps fifty miles away. But the
teacher has to be something more than a mere
dragger of kids up Parnassus. He must be a good
bushman, able to cook a johnny-cake or damper,
patch up a fractured shaft, mend harness, and
track a missing horse.
“ Snakebite ” : Have noted the various
big shearing tallies mentioned in recent
Bulletins. But, for some reason, the
place the mightiest tallies come from has
been omitted. I mean the pub bar on
a Saturday night. This (Tooborac) is
the centre of a wood-hewing district,
and it is like a Riverina township, ex-
cept as to talk, which circles round
wood, instead of wool. It is marvellous
the tally a man can cut, or has cut,
after six or eight beers. It is only
beaten by the tally of the man who
has had twelve beers. Approaching
the local pub on a fine Saturday night,
it is possible to hear the ring of the
axes and the whir of the saws nearly
a quarter of a mile off, and when one
nears the door the sawdust gets posi-
tively choking. Curious no Abo.
observer has touched on this phenome-
non before.
“ Cict ”: Be shingles versus iron. “ J.G.”
(B. 20/2/’08) backs “Sr’’ in his assertion that the
former are several lengths superior to iron as a roof,
and heaps discredit on my contradiction of the
same. But “Sr’s” supporter runs amok rather
recklessly in his whoops for the wooden coverlets.
He finds palings and shingles vastly cheaper than
my roof. Plainly evident that “J.G.” resides in
a tent. The work of splitting and dressing is
superfluous in iron, and indispensable in shingles.
Also while iron requires a baton to the yard,
shingles demand one to every six inches. Further,
iron needs two screws to the square yard, and
shingles two pounds of nails to ditto. But “J.G.”
rants most pitiably where he accuses iron roofs of
shedding water just slightly in advance of the
shingle stuff. Evident here that “ J.G.” does not
drink water, and also does no laundrying. Water
from gum, stringy, black-butt and, in fact, from
all eucalypts, is about equal to logwood chips as a
dye, only that it lingers longer, is more smellful,
and more solid as a corroder. Notice, too, how
carefully “J.G.” steers wide of the fiery qualities
of his chosen house-lids.
Thus Thos. Griffiths (described on his
letter-head as “ sawmiller, timber merchant, sash
and joinery manufacturer, cabinet maker. Turnery
of all descriptions. Handles: axe, hoe, pick,
miners’ pick, broom—manufactured on the pre-
mises ”), of Cairns (Queensland) :
In reply to “ Chopper” (B. 13/2/’08) I should like to sav
that the crow’s-foot elm growing: in the Cairns district is
miles ahead of American hickory for anything- light and
bendable, such as handles, shafts and poles, and, if
“ Chopper ” will send me his address, I will send him an
axe-handle made in Cairns ready to try conclusions with
any “ water-gum ” or imported article that he likes to
enter for competition. Also I should like “Chopper” to
know that there is an Australian axe-handle made which
can compete in price with, and outclass, any imported
handle. This is in Cairns, where Tub Bulletin will have
it that we take off our hats to the Chinaman.
This free advt. is given cheerfully, in the hope
that it will fix the public eye on a rising Aus-
tralian industry.
“ Flinderino ” : Talk about the impu-
dence of young Australia ! At one time when a
stranger approached a blacks’ camp the juvenile
King Billies and their little sisters would dis-
appear into the gunyahs and hide in
the farthest corners, and the depart-
ing visitor was always well out of
coo-ee before the little black nuts
would bob out. But it is not so now.
The little abos. of the present day
have not much trace of shyness
about them. Whilst following
down the Mulgrave River (N.Q.)
the other day, I happened on a
blackfellows’ camp, pitched on
an island in the stream. Out-
side one of the dome-shaped
mansions stood a little, shiny-
black, pocket comedienne—a girl
about five years old. wearing nothing
but a precocious facial expression. This diminu-
tive Miss had a short clay pipe stuck in her mouth
and she pretended to be smoking. Directly I got
within speaking distance the youngster gave a
knowing side-nod and wished me “ Goo’day ! ”
Before I had time to be astonished she rattled off
a few questions. “Wat yourr name? Yourr
name Tommie ? You got um ’bacca ? You gibbit
me ’bacca? My wurrd!” Just then an aged
gin interrupted the conversation by giving the
kiddie a clout on the head and calling it what I
expect was equivalent to “You little brat!”
The nipper scampered off into the scrub, but was
back the next moment making inquiries about my
family history.
* * * *
“H.E.8.”: Away in the backblocks of
Central Otago (M.L.) there is a dog leading the
worst kind of dog’s life I know of. Travelling
recently from Clyde to Cromwell in the coach,
where the road skirts the precipitous Upper
Clutha Gorge, we came upon the poor brute
chained up right on the edge of the ravine His
kennel consisted of a box standing on its edge
and close alongside there was a barrel of water le*-
into the ground. The driver slung the animal a
bundle of raw meat, but the canine was so de-
lighted at the sight of human activity that he
ignored the meat altogether (although he was
probably starving), and, wagging his tail ecstati-
cally, implored us in dog language to let him
loose. When we drove away he strained his eves
after us till we were lost to view down the road
Inquiries of the driver elicited the information
that the hermit-dog was a “ boundary-keeper ”
and his duty was to bark at stray sheep to keep
them off the road. His bill-of-fare consisted of
the parcel of meat thrown to him from the coach
and if the coach happened to miss a day or two
didnt get anything, that was all. “ How W
has he been chained up?” I asked. “Five
months ; but he broke away once,” was the reolv
And his case is not an isolated one, by any means’
“ Pilio ” : Re the smuggled Chows.
“ Suss,” on this subject (B. 23/l/’08), writes piffle.
Have just come from the N.T. after several years’
residence there, and I know, personally, every
mine manager or mining man who has been in
that country during my time. On that know-
ledge, and although I’ve a “dead cert ” for next
Melb. Cup, I’ll have a bet with “Suss” instead :
(1) I’ll bet him anything up to a “ pony” that he
cannot find in the N.T. a mine manager employ-
ing 20 Chows who cannot speak English a little;
(2) I’ll give him 20 to 1 in fivers that he cannot
find in the N.T. a mine manager who runs to
seven house-servants, either Chow or otherwise; (3)
I’ll bet a tenner I can prove his informant a liar.
As far as Darwin is concerned, these ravings
about the smuggled Chow are exaggerated. An
occasional one may get ashore, but to speak of
them as being “ common as flies ” is rot. 1 believe
that at present we have fewer Chows than ever
before. The yellowskin as a miner is losing
ground, too; and it has been proved time and
time again that the steady white miner is far
cheaper. The latest proof is on the Golden
Boulder mine, at West Arm. where sinking by
Chows ran to about 235. per foot, and by whites
to about 19s. The great trouble is that too many
laboring drunks and ne’er-do-weels find their way
to the N.T., and that too many good, solid White-
Australia employers know that the average
white laborer at his disposal up there is a
“rotter.” The writer is a White Australian
every time, but he would prefer to lose
money over the blasted Chow rather than
have the “fear of God ” in his heart every time he
puts a shilling into the hand of his white em-
ployee. For the Chow drinks little, and he can
be relied upon to do a little in a long time. The
white man can do a fair day’s work in the N.T.,
but he cannot do this and wreck his constitution
by drink at the same time. Much could be
written of the N.T., and much could be said of
its mismanagement, misfortunes and maligners;
but it is a grand country. Kill its isolation. Give
it good sound management (not South Australian
—unless it alters) and an infusion of new blood
and common-sense enterprise and—well, we shall
see,
“ F.H.R.” meets an insect or two :
It was a gloomy day, and the heavens were the color of
a well-punched eye. We were working right in front of
our camp, on the railway', pulling up the old line and
relaying with new rails.
Centipedes—big, long, green and yellow things, with
legs hanging all over them like the frayed end of a carpet
—were disputing possession with us all day, and now and
again a man would grab himself and start to deal it out
to a six-inch “ creeper ” inside his trousers. At night, on
finding their old homes destroyed by earthquake, so to
speak, they set out to seek new quarters, as they could
feel rain in the air.
Swarms of them came into the tent and climbed the
walls or bunk legs. They would drop suddenly on Us
from above, like a sbower of blessings, or attack us
stealthily from beneath. One dropped across my mous-
tache and broke my nerves. I pulled 75 per cent, of ray
moustache and a streaky thing with 40,000 legs on it from
under my nose, and threw it to the ground. Then mv
mate lit his railway lantern, and for the rest of that night
of misery we lay with the light between us on the ground,
and, armed each with a blucher boot, laid about us un-
ceasingly.
Now and again curses and howls of terror came to us
from along the line of tents, showing that the attack was
general. Later on, a group of navvies could be seen
round a fire of condemned sleepers, cursing the railway,
centipedes, and any other subject that found its way
through the smoke.
Then it started to rain, and when oilskins were brought
out brisk betting was indulged in as to the number of
’pedes each contained. Twenty-six of the loathsome
bedmates were found in one overcoat, which was acting
as a pillow on a bunk. Take it all through, ’twas a rest-
less night, but next morning the general in charge of
that legsome infantry column moved them away south
and took up new quarters for the winter. If he had per-
sisted in the attack, twenty-two navvies, one ganger and
a nipper would have suffered defeat and been forced to
retreat. There are enemies that cannot be dispersed with
a gun or a spiking hammer, and the best hit ever taught
by Larry Foley can be dodged by a centipede with ease
and grace.

pared notes): "Gen'lcmen, I little dreamt when
I came here this evening that I would be called

BALLADE OF THE COUNTRY BOY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Farmers are finding- increasing difficulty in securing the
services of lads. —Daily papers.
When John came home from Sydney town
The dandy of his school,
He counted Dad a witless clown
And Mum a gentle fool,
The unsophisticated pair
Would plant him on the farm,
But not a blessed thing was there
That had for John a charm.
It was a chill and sudden shock
When someone came to rouse
His peaceful dreams at four o’clock
And put him milking cows ;
He fed the pigs till afternoon,
And growing quite profane,
Let down the rails by the lagoon
When cows came home again.
Said he, “ I hate and loath a farm,
There’s too much pig and cow.”
The old folk heard with dull alarm
And corrugated brow.
“ I’d rather work from nine till five
And wear a panama-r,
I want to hail a cab and drive
To Flossie’s private bar ! ”
lie said, “ The country is a place
For funny old gossoons,
I want to go to matinees
On Wednesday afternoons.”
The old folks’ argument was vain,
He merely shook his head,
Tattooing on the window-pane,
“ The town for me,” he said.
“ I want to be a clerk and wear
A collar to my neck.
I'd cut a pretty shape, I swear,
With my good monthly cheque ! ”
He said, “ The country is for churls
And pigs and cows and loons,
I want to mash the dazzled girls
On Wednesday afternoons 1”

“ Coalopolis ” : Apropos of “David H.
Richards’” par. (B. 13,/2/’08) re people who wear
nakedfeetat Bundaberg(Q.), an old story returns
to my memory. At the time, Queensland was suffer-
ing sadly from an immigrant invasion. People
without any capital—many of them without trades
—had arrived by hundreds, expecting to find a
warm welcome and have easy berths provided for
them the moment they landed. As a consequence
of their want of foresight they were presently
homeless and bootless loafers. A friend of mine,
who told me this yarn, said he experienced a most
strikingly warm welcome on the day of his arrival.
As the ship moored alongside the wharf, he saw
there hordes of barefooted men and women. He
fancied that the rule of the country was ease
before elegance, and so lie took off his boots and
socks, and the first object he landed upon, with
his bare soles, was an iron plate which had been
laid down a few moments before, red hot, on that
said wharf to cool. He didn’t linger on that
plate, neither did he strike the dignified posi-
tion one might expect from a new arrival greeting
his adopted land for the first time. He just spoke
two word, “ Gosh,” and “ Damn,” and leaped into
the river to cool.

“ Microsis Most towns have some dis-
tinguishing-mark. Thus Athens possesses its
Parthenon ; Rome has St. Peter’s ; London
has Fog ; Sydney has Grievances, and so
on; Charters Towers leading suit is goats.
The population, including goats, is 50,000.
Taught school there some years ago. The
goats attended more punctually than the
scholars. It was their habit to walk into
the schoolroom, stroll between
the desks, and commandeer the
children’s lunch bags, which they
(the goats) then ate, paper and all.
The goat is to Charters Towers
what the cow is in other parts.
The locals not only eat, drink, and
talk goat; they dream and think
goat. They also smell goat unceas-
ingly. In any future competition
for the goatiest spot in the Com-
monwealth I shall not hesitate to
nominate Charters Towers; in
this regard I consider it a world
beater.
“ Oxo ” : Like its fellow-curses
imported from, the Cold Country, the
deer bids fair to spread his elusive per-
sonality and voracious appetite the
greater part of Gippsland. It was accli-
matised on Snake Island, in Port Albert, and
legally protected there ; but it apparently pined
for greater freedom and the excitement of a gam-
ble for life, so it swam across the narrow channel,
and had a good time among the crops of the
Welshpool farmers. It has now spread as far
north as Poowong, where it has astonished the
natives by its vigilance and vitality. Two barrels
charged with heavy shot let loose on a stag’s hide
at 30yds. produce no effect save a record sprint on
the part of the stag.
Dear B., — Re the ungrowable cabbage on
Monaro. Very fine tomatoes, watermelons,
pumpkins, cucumbers, onions, and lettuce, super-
fine cabbages, and most other seasonable vege-
tables are ready for use in our patch of garden
now, and the soil here is similar to Dalgety, I
suppose. Cherries, plums, pears, apples, goose-
berries, etc., all do well in the orchard attached
to this mountain homestead. What was Mr.
Teece dreaming about? —Yours, etc., E. (Monaro

COURTESY BEFORE THE DELUGE.
J UBAL: “I hear it's your birthday, old man. Congratulations!”
METHUSELAH: “ Yes, I’m 905 to-day.”
Jubal: “Dear me, I'd never have thought it. You don't look a day more than 700.”
The highest slaughtering yard in Aus-
tralia is on top of Perisher Gap, about three miles
from Kosciusko. It is not elaborate and probably
never passed an inspector, but it goes. A rough
yard built of twisted misshapen saplings stands
in the midst of a clump of drawf timber.
There is no gallows, but a pulley hangs on the
limb of a crooked tree, and serves to yank up the
carcase. This enterprise is run by the butcher at
Jindabyne, and when the full force of men were
working on the new road, he was assassinating
four beasts a week.
ONCE BITTEN, TWICE SHY.
OLD WOMAN (after reading the bigamy case):
“That bloke only got seven years. I’d shoot
’im !”
H UBBY: “ Judgin' from my experience, 'c oughter
got orf!"
“Vigilans”: Where are the Queensland
squatters on the Western Downs? I only hear
an echo ! The mortgage coi is everywhere. The
old stamp of squatter has gone; the Ramsays, of
Oondaroo, and one or two others are all that are
left of the pioneers. Even the Chirnsides have
given Queensland best. The Western Downs are
heart-breaking. Rain favors the few, and the
many watch the storms dodging round the horizon.
Just now (Feb. 14) the country presents the pro-
verbial picture. But see it six months hence
dried up, parched, cracked, ugh ! It’s a feast or
a famine; they get six inches of rain in one
month and go the other 11 without a shower. Look
at it now, and you would exclaim “No better
country on God’s earth for jumbucks ! ” Where-
fore, men and institutions are again land-hungry,
and many properties have been sold lately at big
prices, which later on will force the new owners
to over-stock—and then trouble won’t be far off—-
the same old trouble.
When vou want a pleasant physic try

“Murri” : The new road to the top of
Mount Kosciusko, whieh-is now complete, is a
big enterprise. The grading has been well done,
and, if it stands, a motor will run up at a {air-
speed to the highest point on this continent. In
fact, a pair of good horses, with a lining to their
innards, should be able to trot with a light trap
right from Jinaabyne tb the top of the mountain.
That is, if the road stands. Whether it will or
not remains to be seen. I reckon it- will not. A
big winter, followed by a wet, sudden spring-and
a quick melting of the snow on the ranges, will
probably obliterate it. .And' that opinion is
shared by many old hands on the Monaro, who
remember., some of the seasons before the Great
Continuous Drought struck the continent. Some
of the country passed through is composed of
decayed vegetable matter, as soft a soil as can be
found in creation, and this stuff has been used for
the making of the road that has to stand the strain
of an icy winter, and the shock of avalanches and
floods of water. The road is too soft all through.
Mountain springs are another source of trouble,
for they break out everywhere, and there are
several on the track already. A big lump of
money is being splashed on this job for the benefit
of the leisurely, moneyed crowd, as might be ex-
pected from a Reform Government. But that
will not be the last of the trouble. Maintenance
will prove exceedingly costly, and a small army
of surfacemen will be kept —if they are not
washed away with the road. Joey Carruthers
and his engineers did not learn their road-making
from the Romans.

“ Jimmy ” : “ Prooshan ” (B, 19/12/’O7)
needn’t get excited about his fossicker who made
a 40ft. pot hole on his lonesome. Any'old field
can show better than that. The championship
belongs to old Alick Short, who put down the
Illabo, on Nana Creek (once regarded as a second
Mt. Morgan) 186 ft. He used to fill oil drums,
then climb to the top of the shaft, hook them,
and run them out through 250 ft. of tunnelling to
the tip. All this work Short did alone. He was
supported by Government aid and a first-class
gun. The gun he used to take in to the Clarence
whenever a pigeon match was on, and his share
of the prize money used to go a long way towards
keeping the old chap in tucker. He never had
any other backer or mate. Another celebrated
hatter was Bill Vanderkolk (“ Dutch Bill ”), who
at Walgin, between Dungog and Copeland
(N.S.W.), putin a tunnel several hundred feet,
on Government aid. The country was hard
altered slate, bad for boring, and worse for
“shooting.” Bill applied for another grant to
carry him in 1000 ft., but the Government In-
spector of the time, when he surveyed and plotted
the work out, came to the conclusion that instead
of striking for the reef, the tunnel was running
almost parallel to it, and refused to recommend
another grant. Bill in disgust shifted to Bucca
Creek, where he put in another tunnel, 180 ft., of
which the greatest depth from the surface was about
20ft. When I pointed this out to the veteran he
was in no way disconcerted. “Dot’s all right,”
said he, “I don’t got no storm water now.”
PROSPECT ROAD.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Working- Bee of alleged farmers who made a goodly
stretch of the Prospect Road, near Sale (Vic.), extolled by
the Daily Press, and sung by “Milky White,” was in
reality a Bee consisting chiefly of workers and wood-
rarters. The enterprise was organised and conducted by
“ Jim ” McLachlan.
O ! the Bard called “ Milky White ”
Was he sober? Was he tight? -
When he bounded into light
With his ode
Had he got outside a keg ?
Was he putting in the peg?
When the cockies pulled his leg
Prospect Road.
For the person is a liar
Who avers the Rosedale Shire
Left its Bag of Wheat in ire,
And its bail ;
Tied its boyangs round its knees,
Left the Cows for Working Bees,
Felled the giant messmate trees.
Up by Sale.
Did the noble Cow Brigade
Ever seize a pick or spade?
Or were fools and horses made
All in vain ?
While the State Cow isn’t dead
And State coffers can be bled.
These folks work and pray—in bed—
For the rain.
’Twas a Socialist called “ Jim ”
Got the workers in the swim,
And they ran with grit and vim
The affair.
And the Cockies of the Vale,
As the}' sat astride a rail,
Cheered the working men of Sale —
I was there.
And I want this favor done
As the bardic round you run,
Bard of Beaconsfield. You son
Of a gun,
When you build the lofty rhyme,
Sing the working bloke next time—
By his strength and grit and grime
Was it done.

drama, and then write in earping fashion to this paper
because Ada Guilford wears a Clara Butt hat in the year

Marwick has ceased to interest....A.N. : “She never
Loved Me ” is shaky as to spelling and metre ; yet it
makes good in the matter of Passionate Intensity. Also
its quaint archaism is very telling. A sample verse :
It is to-night on this sad night
I fix the date within my mind ;
It is to-night my heart I smite ;
All words of love I shall unbind.
And toss them on the evening breeze,
And hope that they will lose their way ;
Though my poor heart will know no ease
Until, until, my dying day.
....Justice: What if Kidston is paying out money from
the Treasury? Kidston has the country (and therefore
presumably the Parliament behind him); Philp, on the
other hand, was specifically refused Supply, and was re-
peatedly informed, in an official way, that he didn’t have
the confidence of Parliament. The man who, can’t see a
difference between them is liable to mistake Gabriel for
Beelzebub....Fulford: Verse’s sincerity doesn’t quite
make up for its lack in other directions. A good cause
calls £or good verse. '.. .8.8. : Purposeless, pointless, and
clumsily versified... .G. W. Pike : One tolerable, one bad,

army of Percys, Cecils and similarly named children when
they reach the grafting stage ? ” Well, Montague Noble
is playing cricket, likewise Warwick Armstrong, and

THE LITTLE BOY OF ASHFIELB.
Albert Parade, Ashfleld.
Dear Mr. Noble,—l feel very proud to
be able to write to such a distinguished
Australian captain and cricketer, an
occupation I hope to till one day myself.
I am only eleven, butT have seen you
play In a good many matches, and I
think more of your stubborn defence on
a wet wicket, when you would go In
and sacrifice yourself on a bad wicket
to save your side. 1 have got a good
many cricket materials, which I
think much of.

Senator Neild had to put his little poster
on the coffin of Hopetoun. In the Senate, a motion
of condolence was under discussion when —
Senator Neild desired, as a distant member of the
family, or clan, of which the late lamented peer was so
distinguished a member, to say how much he appreciated
the words which had fallen from Senators Best and Milieu.
The late Nathaniel Knox, one of Ade-
laide’s old-established family lawyers, who died
recently, was the unofficial high priest of the
Holy City’s Theosophical Society. He always
entertained visiting panjandrums of the indefinite
and spooky cult, and was Annie Besant’s host in
these parts.
Died, in Westralia, H. W. Venn, a man
unknown out of his own little ’Groper politics,
yet with two records that might have made a
bigger man famous: he was one of the first
Ministers under Responsible Government in
Westralia, and at the Sydney and Melbourne
conferences he represented his State at the Con-
vention that framed the Australian Constitution.

Miners' Friend.
TSow that David Syme is revising proofs

A CURRENCY OCCURRENCE.
Excuse me, sir, but have you any of the medium of exchange, of discharging., obligations,
and of settling balances?”
“ What on earth do you mean? ”
"A tanner!”
Ex-Justice Owen, of N.S.W:, was very
nearly being called William Kynaston. Hiscousin,
John Kynaston, died, leaving money and property
to the Owen family in Ireland, hut on condition
that the beneficiaries should renounce the name of
Owen and assume that of Kynaston by royal
license. The ex-Judge’s brothers accepted the
condition, but Wllliam stuck to the old patronymic.
The ex-Judge arrived in Sydney in 1860. All the
Judges then on the Bench of the Upper or Lower
Court are dead. Of the 21 barristers then prac-
tising only M. H. Stephen, G. B. Simpson and
W. J. Foster survive, the first and last as pen-
sioners. Cecil B. Stephen was then smiling about
the courts, but it was as Associate to his father.
John Carr, of Adelaide, who had a pretty
steady billet as Minister for Works from 30 to 40
years ago, is entering upon his ninetieth year.
For the last half-century or so he has worn a large
wig, which used to be the subject of sport in the
days when he figured in State politics. Time was
wßep Carr was hailed by drinkers of “soft tack ”
.asia model teetotaler ; but in recent years he has
horrified devout Methodists By advocating the
use of something stronger than iimejuice.
AVhy, anyway, was the imported Railway
Commissioner Johnson entrusted with the selec-
tion of a city electrical engineer for Sydney ? As
a matter of fact, Johnson knows practically
nothing of electricity as a science, and holds con-
servative views concerning it. A little while
-/terhe reached Sydney he attended a meeting of
the Electrical Engineers’ Society, when a discus-
sion arose about the electrification of railways.
He essayed to point out an English failure to
illustrate Ins view. But one of his own electrical
staff (Brain) asked the secretary to hunt up some
•papers close handy, and then Johnson’s version
was knocked sky-high.
Since Clem Hill, the cricketer, married a
rich Tasmanian a blossom of the Hart family
he hasn’t taken criticism kindly; and when he
reads remarks about men hanging on to the game
for the sake of trips to England, he fumes that
he can pay for his own trips, thank you. Also he
is “ full up ” of the guying that a man has to
stand m the field without a chance of hitting
back ; so he won’t play “ big ” cricket anv more.
1 robably also Darling’s retirement reminds him
that the time can’t be far off when even he is liable
to be asked, to stand down. Clement is the son of
the man. who founded the old coaching firm of
John Hill and Co., and later on became one of the
o. Aus. Railway Commissioners.
Sydney commercialism is still gasping at
the selection of O. 0. Lance as a member of
Sydney Harbor Trust, in place of Lachlan Beaton,
who suddenly retires. The most plausible ex-
planation put forward is that Beaton, being “ well
in,” didn’t want the job, while Lance did. The
new man’s claims to fame are based on the facts
that he at one time tried his hand at managing
the Iresh Food and Ice Co., and that lately he
has been a Government butter and cheese expert
ln London. Sydney commercial men
especially those who were perseveringly circling
round the Harbor Trust billet themselves, are
wildly demanding to know what butter and dried
fish have to do with the Harbor Trust, and why
Lance left Threadneedle-street, or whatever
London street it is the State butter gets pawed
over in, to grab a job they could have taken them-
selves, especially if Lance was pawing the butter
satisfactorily in 1 hreadnoedle-street.
While Bent and ade are considering the
matter of wheat bags at the coming Insects’ Con-
nnr° e ' they might also consider the case of
William Clark, now lying in Nhill (Vic.) hospital,
with a broken rib and an injured spine. Clark
was stacking “regulation” wheat bags—which
means anything up to 3601 b.—at a Netherby farm
on February 26, when a bag overbalanced and fell
on him. Ihe bag wasn’t damaged. Neither was
the farmer. Neither was Bent. But Clark will
do no more wheat-stacking all his days, even if he
ever leaves his bed.

Apropos of Hosie’s Cafe, in Melbourne. In the
fifties Mr. Hosie kept a boot and shoe shop in Bourke-
street East, south side, a few doors from Elizabeth-street.
Hosie and wife were Scotch, and broad at that. The wife
about the year 1860, opened a corner of the boot shop, or
» v «y small place attached to it, as a pie depot. I think
t ere two tables in it. The place caught on.
After a time the boots and shoes were cast aside, and the
whole shop converted into “pies and coffee.” Hosie
made a fortune, and sold out to Dillon and Burrows a
comhtion of the sale being that he was not to open a new

it, and explained the situation to Dillon and Burrows
who promptly told him he couldn’t open there. “ I can
if I pay the £3OO, and there’s the coin,” said the Scots
and he dropped a heavy bag on the counter. Hosie
opened the new place, a huge one for those davs and
went ahead. Strange to say, Dillon and Burrows’also

of the Bank of New South Wales, aged 75 years.
It was he who saw the bank through the financial
crisis of the early ’nineties, giving place in 1894 to
Bussell French, who up, to then had been chief
inspector.
Treasurer Peake, the other day, advised
the Adelaide School of Mines to establish a class
in Political Engineering, and promised to enrol
himself as a student. Whereupon Federal Speaker
Holder retorted that if the class were started,
Peake would be engaged as teacher.
For the fourteen hundredth time (or there-
abouts) the wedding of T. Bent, of Victoria, with
“a wealthy widow,” is said to be imminent. It
is a curious matrimonial fact about Thomas that
he is-always rumored to be engaged to one whose
relict' is planted; and the lone and usually
mythical-female is never represented as wholly
without means. This one is the extremely pluto-
cratic ex-spouse of an old and dead Maoriland
settler.
An old Maitland (N.S.W.) identity,
Edwards King, died on February 23, aged 94
years. He had resided at West Maitland for
half-a-cejitury. In the early days he was engaged
in ship-;building,iand constructed the Australian
Sovereign, a vessel of 500 tons, at King’s Point,
on the'«Patersontßiver. In those days N.S.W.
and Tasmania made a little splash in the ship-
building business, but under the influence of the
importing cratfe the industry faded.
A. O. Sachse, Victoria’s wonderful Minis-
' ter for Education, is a patent agent in his lighter
moments. An extract from one of his circulars
reads as follows :
The smallest improvement or invention may be the
means of making considerable profit to the man or women
who invents the new idea. Should there he any doubt in
the mind of the originator as to whether the idea is not
suitable, such doubts will be removed by sending the
rough particulars to the below address.—A. 0. Sachse
C.E.
And the author of that fearsome hash of grammar
is Bentls Minister for Education ! Sachse ought
to attpnd a night school.
Editor Robertson, who left for England on
a six months’ holiday on February 27, has been for
35 years connected with the Adelaide Advertiser,
which he joined as a boy of about 15. During
those years he has never been away from the office
for more than three weeks at a time. He has been
chief leader writer for over 20 years, and has had
editorial charge since editor-in-chief Bonython
was first elected to the Australian Parliament in
1901. He is an ardent Protectionist, an enthusias-
tic Radical, and, on his own admission, is the
worst and most nervous speaker in Australia.
“ N.” : The last National Review has a
stinging article on Queen Victoria, by Sir E.
Blennerhassett. It gathers up much that is known
to the well-informed, and adds something known
to very few. England’s crisis was in 1864. There
was a duel between Premier Palmerston and
Queen Victoria. On the Premier’s side were the
Prince and Princess of Wales. The Queen was
backed by everything German. The question
was : Should Britain join with France in prevent-
ing the Prussian and Austrian spoliation of Den-
mark ? “ Yes,” said Palmerston, with all his
might. Queen \ ictoria and her German parasites
said “No.” And Victoria and the parasites
carried the day. Britain had solemnly guaranteed
the integrity of Denmark, and the ink was
scarcely dry on the document; but, to please
Victoria and her Germans, it went back on its
word, and left Denmark in the lurch.
On the initiative of Judge Gordon, who is
a fleshy man and fond of being comfortable, S.
Australia witnessed an awful thing the other day
—a court plodding through without horsehair or
gowns. Judge and counsel moulted their head-
gear first, and when they found that Justice didn’t
drop dead they asked his Honor, through Jos.
Wymon, whether he thought he could see them if
they moulted their gowns too. His Honor said
his eyesight was pretty good, whereupon every-
body moulted some more. There is English pre-
cedent for this, anyhow. In 1873 Dr. Kenealy
rose, dressed in a large bare head, a gown, and
some unpaid fees, to defend the famous Tieh-
borne claimant. He was almost the only counsel
on record who gave tick for his “ retainer ” and
took 1.0.U5. for his “refreshers.”
Vic. : The late Hopetoun’s father was
a great habitue behind the scenes at the London
1 nncess s during the Kean management. This
Lord Hopetoun was courting pretty little Agnes
Kobeitson, Mrs. Kean s ward. Mrs. K. was
agreeable to the match. However, Dion Bouci-
cault, dramatist to the Princess’s, bolted with
Agnes to She became the mother of
Aubrey, Dot, and Nina Boucicault, and Mrs.
Clayton. She might have been happier as Lady
Hopetoun. The Hopetoun we knew’ would not
patronise the Bijou under the management of
Brough and Boucicault. Perhaps he didn’t want
to see the man who might have been himself if
Agnes Robertson had married differently. A weak
constitution seems to have run in the family, for
Hopetoun VI ched when Hopetoun VII. wasonly
'Vhat pluck he had ! Because he was a weakling
Le rngst needs persist in hunting. His poor thin
egs, m Australian bushman’s breeches, were like
the purser s shirt on a rnarlin’-spike. Because a
moustache made him handsome, Lady Hopetoun
torbade it. \V hen she went to England by herself

THE TRUE STATE OF THE CASE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Incidentally Mr. Reid assured his audience that from
the newspapers it might be supposed that he was an
object of hatred in some parts of Australia. This was not
the case.— Sydney Telegraph report (6/3/’08) of G. lieid's
School of Arts address.
Last week I stood without a city hall,
Expectant for my gentle Greid to come ;
Which soon he did, and scaled the steps. Withal
None sounded gladsome tabor, or eke drum.
Attended by a seething crowd of five,
I surged in after him, and sat me down.
Gaunt the place seemed, and grim enough to drive
A nervous subject out and on the town.
Amid a dreadful hush, Greid took the stage
And spoke. An aged man observed “ Hear ! hear ! ”
And thumped his gamp—yet he did not assuage
The public boredom, nor make things less drear.
Mournfully through the room the speaker’s voiee
Rang ; rising now, now falling to a moan,
Plaintively low. The man who could rejoice
At those sad notes would need a heart of stone.
(“ Of stone,” since on this earth there is no sight
So painful as to watch those who descend
The public ladder, yet put up a fight
To keep within the limelight till the end.)
There as I sat I gave me o’er to thought
Of Greid—the Greid I knew a decade back ;
He who drew crowds, who argued, laughed, and fought,
And gave his hearers all they seemed to lack.
And asked myself : “ How has he come so low,
Whose words of yore huge public meetings fired?
Do people hate him ? ” Came the answer : “No.
Far worse. The trouble is he makes them tired.”

The parochial person is humorous at times
One signing himself “ W.A. Citizen ” recently
wrote to a Perth paper advancing the opinion that
it was t ederation which drove Parson Bird, of
Perth, the man of many unfortunate speculations,
o suicide. At that rate, Heaven only knows what
Unification would have driven him to. It might
have urged him to cut off his own head and rush
wildly through the streets with it under his arm.
ictoria has a land-tax on big estates—a
land-tax that is so small as to be almost invisible.
Yet small as it is the big landowner will do a
good deal of scheming to evade it. Ke-
cently a land-tax official explored four shires—
Warragul, Maffra, Rochester, and Kerang—and
found there 28 estates which were liable to tax
ut were not paying it. This represents a con-
siderable amount of tax-dodging, and also shows
in a sorrowful fashion how the big estate is eating
up the small one and undoing any trifle of good

THE BENT THREE
It was a surprising thing how many of the newspapers that were finding fault with State Government
were trying day after day to get £100, £150, or £200 for what they would put in those little papers that would
be seen by a few people. These three commissioners would be seen by thousands of people in England and would
do more for Victoria than the little papers would do. BEST on the departing Shepherd's Bush E[?]

Over 1100 persons have been recommended
to N.S.W. Go vernment for inclusion in the annual
batch of new J’s.P. As the present Government
condemns the huge J.P. joke and iniquity, and as
members of Parliament individually denounce the
practice, it would be desirable to have a Parlia-
mentary return prepared showing the names of
members who recommend prospective J’s.P. and
the number of prospective J’s.P. recommended by
each member. That would clear up some things,
anyway.
Here is something for the anti-Socialistic

The State Frights party must have felt

died, leaving a pot of

his executors. When
they a-pplied for pro-

Court, pointing to the
S. Australian Trustee

this person?” It was
explained that this per-
son was a co. working
under a rigid S. Aus-
tralian law, and was
reckoned a very re-
spectable person in-
deed ; and,anyhow, the
dead man wanted that
co. for a trustee. But

The Government of Papua is now beino
vigorously discussed in the daily press, and the

selves.
The Bent Cabinet’s recent reduction of
hotel employees’ hours from 60 to 54 per week
didn’t pass without one small deputation of. pro
test, after all. It consisted of Tory McKetcnun
M.L.A., Walpole, of the Employers’ Federation
and half-a-dozen coffee-palace and pie-shop mana'
gers, probably saving their billets by doing Fat’s
dirty work. The deputation calmly asked Pea-
cock, without giving figures, details, or reasons*
to let them keep on sweating their slaves for 60
hours, in a State where 48 hours is the general thing
For once Peacock found his spine, and told them
they were only wasting time ; and the sweaters
wilted away in disgust.
The new Queensland Parliament began
badly. When the Assembly met each party p ro .
posed a Speaker. The Government nominee was
rejected by 43 to 23 ; the Labor nominee by 44 to
21 ; the Philp nominee by 43 to 22. The House
adjourned for a drink. It met again, and again
everybody was rejected. It adjourned for another
drink. At its next meeting everybody and every
thing was rejected some more. The House then
adjourned for a very brief drink. It met again at
8 p.m., and adjourned to 8.30 (which gave it time
for a short drink); and had a further struggle at
9, and at 9.35 the Government adopted the Philp
nominee, and John Leahy became Speaker. Thai
combination between Philp and Kidston looked a
bad omen.
“ Mate,” from a big inter-State boat
‘‘Binnacle” (B. 27/2/V8) on the North Coast Co’s
officers claim tor better conditions is surely sarcastic
when he refers to Justice O’Connor’s award in the
Merchant Service Guild arbitration case. The increase
then granted amounted to £1 per month to the firs!
mates on about seven of the largest passenger -»g The
pay of the third mates on practically all the pasJ
boats was reduced the same amount. Of course it
not to affect those then in that position, but it hit the
new ones every time. Also the alleged reduction of
hours is practically unworkable in many cases The
inter-State second mates are in the same boat as the State
ones, in that the seamen frequently make more—by over,
time-than they do. The State men have much to
complain of, but it won’t better things to draw conmari
sons with their brothers, who go farther and frequently
fare no better. I have come home from a month’s trio
and not even been able to kiss the kiddies—they being
asleep—before I was off to sea again. y

V?- M'Donald, who is retiring- from the

sponding- to. the toast of his health at a valedictory
gathering, referred to the chances of an officer rising in
the Justice Department.
Mr. M Donald held that under the present regulations
it was possible for a youth entering as a junior to become

Where the tottering baldheads gape :

To climb to the top of the tree ;
You will have to reach the respectable age
Of a hundred and twenty-three.
And that’s no good to me,
For an Under-Secret’ree,
If he be alive at sixty-five,
Gets fired out, don’t you see.
Oh, this is the song of three wise men,
The song of the Solomons three ;
That draft with a worn and a wobbly pen
Their by-laws fearfullee.
Oh, this is the song of a worn-out plank,
Where the white ant runneth free—
A plank that has got the dry, dry rot,
And they call it the P.S.B.

For we cannot possiblee,
Howe’er we strive, remain alive

THE CAPITAL SITE.
[FOR THE BULLHTIN.]
Australia found the capital site
(’Twas a capital Capital site) ;
Some Sydneysiders woke one night,
In the Ma State in a state of fright,'
And hunted round in a hopeful light
To find their own site. They thought ’twas right
To keep their small State dignity bright.
They found, they thought, a suitable site
(But, ’twixt ourselves, ’twas a sight of a site).

A. W. Howitt did not remain long after
his friend and collaborator, Dr. Fison ; he died at
his home (Bairnsdale, Gippsland) on Saturday,
aged 78 years. He was the son of William and
Mary Howitt, the distinguished authors, and
came to Victoria in his youth. By reason of his
knowledge of the bush he was selected to lead one
of the expeditions in search of Burke and Wills,
the explorers, and at Cooper’s Creek he found
John King, the sole survivor of the muddled ex-
pedition. On a later expedition he brought in
the remains of the leaders. He was appointed a
police magistrate, and subsequently became Secre-
tary for Mines. In conjunction with Rev. Lorimer
Fison he published, in 1880, a work On the marriage
customs of certain tribes of aborigines. He
married a daughter of the late and turbulent
Justice Boothby, of South Australia.
Ex-Premier Garruthers, speaking across
the empty liquor bottles at his valedictory ban-
quet at Sydney Town Hall, eulogised the present
system of appointing Governors. England, he
said, always sent its ‘best men to the Mother
State, and their strict “impartiality and life-long
experience were a guarantee that the State
frights should be properly represented at Down-
,[)g Street. This was why Joey was particularly
careful not to go to one of the best men of Eng-
land when he wanted authority to steal the wire-
netting. Knowing Gov. Rawson to be one of
England’s best men, the little political insect
presumably guessed his request would be thrown
out with violence. So he carefully waited till one
of the best men of England was away on a holi-
day, and then sailed in and bamboozled the local
deputy to authorise his grossly.illegal actr—an act
lor which he ought to have been brought to trial.

work, and it was as much as I could do to get
through that. My hands were cold, my skin
clammy, and my ankles dreadfully puffed. I had
no color in my face, and I was so thin you could
almost see through my hands. 1 had headaches
that came on quite suddenly—perhaps Id be
talking to someone and I’d have to go and lie
down quite giddy and faint. The pains darted
across my forehead and made my eyes quite dim.
If I bent down or stooped my eyes would have
lights flashing and millions of specks in front ot
them, and then blackness. I’d often faint away.
If I climbed the stairs my heart palpitated dread-
fully and I’d have to sit down. I had ringing
noises in my head and some days I would be quite
deaf. 1 suffered cruelly from neuralgic attacks
and my nerves were all unstrung. 1 started at
the least sound and trembled all over. I slept
fairly well, though some nights 1 was\erv restless.
1 always felt melancholy. I’d burst into a fit w
tears for no cause. In the mornings I’d start to

BUCHANAN’S WHISKY,
“BLACK and WHITE.”
FACILE PRINCE PS SF M PER IDEM
A WOMAN’S LETTER.
Sydney, March 10, 1908.
My Dear Arini
Sydney has been as dull as a wet crow. Now
comes Lent, and it’s going to be as dull as a dead
crow. I see that America has started an Anti-
Gloom Club, called The Optimistic. It is signifi-
cant that the headquarters of the organisation
are in Salt Lake City. Perhaps the originator has
a bunch of merry wives—“ Tlie Merry \N iyes of
Utah ” “ When in doubt take optimism, says
the club’s philosophy. It sounds better than
“ take a dvnamite cocktail.” Alsq in the realm
of the birds the lark is the optimist, the crow is
the pessimist. Why be a crow? ” lortunately
Sydney will be a crow for six weeks only. Atter
that it will be up to its old larks, which are as
tricky as a bag of monkeys.
It conies as something of a shock to those of us
who have been wont to picture the world-famed
Mrs. Melba putting up, when abroad, at huge
hotels, in gorgeous Ouida-like apartments, wheie-
from reigning monarchs have been abruptly fired
at her behest, to know that, when in Paris, the
songstress always goes to a pension (a, pension is,
in plain Australian, a hash-tower. Comfortable
it may be—though it rarely is—but the taint of
the hash-fortress broods over it still). Almost the
last words Melba addressed to Mrs. Lachlan Beaton
took the shape of a strenuous warning to avoid
Paris hotels and to repair with the Ruby Adams
Voice to the particular pension she (Melba) affects.
“ I’ll turn up there myself in a couple of months,
the singer said. “ It’s the only place in Europe
where they do you really well, and wouldn t roll
you of a sou.” Melba goes to Paris, by the way,
on an annual pilgrimage to the Marchesi Mecca
and has her notes treated with the docility of any
debutante.
A bright bit of Australian star dust, too long
blowing about in Gilds, has returned to his
own. Mr. whotya-s taken hence about
the stage" the young male' biped is dressed
allee same as the despised girl, is the author of
several so he has not blown about aimlessly.
“Jean ” “Queen of Unrest,” “ The Galore'GLJj’
and “Rpmorse and Other Essays ” are some of
the bailings of his alert y° un £ brain : f «r he isn t
yet-Anto the thirties. “ The Galore Girl is a
romance of Spain, and the writer seems to know
the enchanting land (for the novelist or painter)
as intimately as our bush writers know their
spinifex and mulga and red-road country.
There are queer fish on land as well as at sea.
One, a lady-fish, who has been wandering through
Maoriland and Australia with her lord, left these
.parts by the Ophir last week. In nearly 20 years
married life she hasn’t-spent one winter ashore in
England ; four-fifths of them she has spent either
on a 40-ton yacht or a 20-ton yawl, coasting around
the English Channel ports, with an occasional run
further south; and her husband has been living this
loafing life for nearly twice as long. The lady-
fish isn’t interested much in such things, but the
queer gentleman fish, who has never any-
thing but spend money all his days, is horrified at
our Australian ways. “ It’s Socialism run mad,
he moaned continuously. “ What’s it coining
to ? ” Coming to ! No whole, useless lives spent
loafing round in yachts and yawls while some
poor, unsuspecting and probably starving
wretches provide the means for the picnic—-isn’t
it horrible to think that a country could be so
depraved ?
Mrs. J. C. Williamson, who returned with her
hubby and infants by the Asturias, endured a
“welcome hack” at the Australia on Monday
afternoon. Mrs. Goodman and Mrs. Charlie Deane
floated the function on the Society market
and it panned out 18oz. to the ton, which any
mining man will tell you is an enormous yield
It was the frockiest thing seen in Sydney this
muggy year. The guest of the hour wore
an achievement that must have cost its
Parisian creators Many An Anxious Hour, and
used up a lot of their Grey Matter. It was
a white-cloth princess made with the “ elegant
simplicity ’’ style which these days court as the
eighth cardinal virtue. Above the belt it was
heavily embroidered in thick white silk. Vertical
insertions of narrow lace ran from neck to hem of
the robe, and a satin belt clasped the waist.
Miss Ola Humphrey floated around in an Irish
crochet lace gown and a coat of the same
lace, with Oriental decorations and a flushed-pink
hat. Miss Florence Young, back at her melody-
making, wasanother princessed figure in something
grey and silver and intricate. Mrs. Barbara
Baynton, the Australian writer who got back by the
Asturias, was also present. So was Mrs. Rickards,
who has a flat on the Asturias for her return trip,
and Mrs. Leete, Miss Constance Usher (who
marries her brass-bound officer in a month’s time),
Miss Fanny Dango, with amazingly-sausaged fair
hair, and pretty Mrs. Harry Plimmer. A large
quantity of merely Society women and a huge
bunch of beautifully tailored men curled the tail
of the function.
Mrs. Grace Miller Ward leaves Australia
presently by the Marama to join her Hugh, the
actor who said “ Bunkidoodle ” with such effect
in “ Mr. Hopkinson.” The musical and dramatic
pair meet in Chicago.
Mr. John Forsyth, manager of the firm of A.
Forsyth and Sons, and nephew of Mr. Archibald
Forsyth, a veteran of the commercial and political
life of this State, is under the doom of the dinner-
and-presentation disease that attacks the popular
man about to board a departing liner for older and
• colder climes. Theßandwick Bowling Club gives
Mr. Forsyth an elegant menu on Wednesday from
which to select his meal, and afterwards presents
him with an address. He was one of the founders
of the R.B.C. and has several times been its
president.
That pretty paw-paw (isn’t that Queensland’s
great eupeptic fruit?) girl, Muriel Rich, is reported
as engaged to marry a man named Cary, in
England. At least, the news comes through the
British Australasian. It will cause Sydney-
siders to recall the admiration of the Duke of
Abruzzi for the fair Northerner. I can’t accurately
recall the Prince’s compliment, but it was the
cultured equivalent of “ she takes the cake.
English illustrated papers at two a penny give
snapshots of a suffragette who broke through
the police cordon when the King and Queen
were going in the old family circus coach
to open Parliament. The girl was carrying
a banner (not a bomb) inscribed “Votes tor
women,” and one of the snaps shows her
distinctly being dragged back by three gigantic
policemen, whilst two more are trying to help in
the haul, and a sixth is rushing up with all his
might to lend a hand in case his mates are over-
powered by one thin girl. A truly patriotic paper
wouldn’t have published a picture like that for
fear of horrid Russians saying horrid things. How
much more dignified it would have been if the
enthusiast had been allowed to go up to the Royal
carriage window and present her petition, or
flap her flag (whichever of these things she
wished to do), and if King Edward had asked her
to step in and take a seat while he read the peti-
tion; or got her to teach him her flag-flap !
What a purple patch is this year ! All the
swell shops have broken out in purple windows
as purple as the cohorts of the Assyrian who came
down like a landlord on overdue rent. The color
purps in many tones down to a livid lavender.
The new millinery shows purple hats with guinea-
fowl flock at the end of the feathers on them. A
recent display exploited purple hats lined with
carmine cloth ana a lo,t of purple brown and
orange roses. Muscatel grapes have come to the
front at the back of the hat, and green and bronze
will be much in partnership when the new, sombre,
heavy-looking millinery is let loose in gloomy
splendor at the Easter races. Shot silk shredded
or frayed (no one seems to know the proper trade
word) at tlie ends, and looking at a distance like
the feathers of a vampire, is much in evidence.
Writing from London, on January 28, Mrs. I red
Shipman mentions a toque worn by one of
the Vanbrugh girls, in “Her Father,” at the
Haymarket. It is made entirely of shaded
roses and giant geraniums in pink and pale orange,
with a high white osprey on one side. Another
piece of headgear the lady wears is an Amazon-
shaped hat in greenish blue straw and basin
crown. A big black picture Jiat of blac : straw.
L’Aed under the brim with white straw, and
finislioj with osprevs, paste buckles and black
satin ribbon, w the last-act confection worn by
this demoiselle of many hats. Our old friend,
Henrietta Watson, in the same play, wears what
reads like an attractive gown. It’s of Chestnut
brown marquisette ; the skirt has a two-inch hem
of brown satin. The full bodice is arranged in
Japanese style, with a soft fichu, which forms the
sleeves, and is bordered with brown satin, like
the skirt. There is a deep waistband of folded
brown satin. The bodice is filled in with a
chemisette of tucked brown chiffon. Welcome
and charming relief in color is afforded by a large
clasp of turquoise matrix set in oxydised silver,
and catching together the fichu draperies. A
narrow turn-down collar of soft white lawn is
worn.
The fog was so thick, drab and impenetrable
and of such double width that Mrs. Shipman
wonders the Londoners didn’t cut it into dress
lengths and put it on the bargain counters under
the name of fog-blanket frieze. The bright little
American mentions that Percy Grainger will come
here with Miss Ada Crossley in September. She
saw Maurice Farkoa in “ Miss Hook of Holland,”
and adds, “Too little voice, too much facade to
his figure.” Little Marie Lohr, whose mother,
Kate Bishop, played for years in Australia,
is the absolutely perfect ingenue in “ Her
Father.” “ It is the stupidest play I have ever
seen,” continues the writer, “and might be
summed up as ‘ A Warning to Prospective
Parents,’ but the staging and acting were capi-
tal. I went, the other day, with Miss Lohr
to Redfern’s, to see her try on her gowns, and
discovered that the old-fashion pull-back was in
again ! All her linings had a shirring string well
above the knees, and it was drawn tightly back
and tied. Then, when the outer skirt was ad-
justed, the figure was decidedly defined.”
This seems to be the season for washing Church
linen in public, and we in N.S.W. are not going
to allow Victoria a monopoly of the laundry work.
So Archdeaeon Abbott, of Tamworth, comes into
print with a pathetic tale of how he was starved
out. He is shepherd of one of the fattest flocks
of the State—the farmers of the Tamworth
district being great heapers-up of treasure;
but he has to explain publicly that the
money his wealthy sheep allow him won’t keep
his household going, and so lie must resign.
When his predecessor died the hat was passed
round to pay his widow, not charity, but
just the arrears of his salary. And i noticed the
other day, in the Herald, somebody advertising
a clergyman’s second-hand frock-coat for sale
cheap. So I presume another shepherd has got
to the stage at which he must eat up his ward-
robe. I feel a wondering pity for these clergy-
men’s wives. What a heart-corroding life Mrs.
Parson must lead! Forced to “keep up
appearances,” expected to be charitable to those
who are not so bitterly poor as herself, the mate
of “the prolific and impecunious parson” (I
quote a recent comedy gibe) surely earns a front
seat in Paradise by her trials on earth.
Of course in some cases there is no Mrs. Parson.
I believe that High Church Anglicans rather
make a point of not marrying, and take vows of
celibacy and so on. But these vows are liable, I
believe, to melt away at two crises in life—when
young Mr. High Church sees a really pretty face
smiling at him, and when elderly Mr. High
Church feels the first twinges of rheumatism.
After an hour at the Prince Alfred Park Buck-
jumping Show, you’ll leave with the conviction
that the horse—the live meat horse —not
golden calf or the leather football, is the idol of
the young male Australian. And in the act of
coming away your conviction will be re-enforced
by another —that the desire to get on the unwilling
horse and stick on him, or to get on him
even to be thrown off, amounts to a yearning
dear as life itself. Outside the tent, during the
interval, those who have seen encounter those who
have not seen because they lack the requisite coin.
The latter are mostly a horde (hundreds strong)
of small boys from about six years of age upwards.
They are white-faced—the small Australian boy
who" hasn’t the requisite coin is pathetically
white-faced, but lie is intensely eager-eyed and
alert, and reminds you, as he begs for “ your pass
if you’re not going back yourself,” of the nervous,
keyed-up horses in the rings. And you’ll wish
with a capital W that you were Mr. Sam
McCaugliey, or some such potentate, just for ten
minutes, to say to the boss of the show “Fill in
this blank cheque, my good man, and let ’em all
come. Haw.’’ In such a case I would certainly
say “ Haw.”
On the run of the Asturias from Fremantle to
Adelaide a girl passenger from the latter port,
who was returning from a visit to Claremont,
hooked the usual marine product—a husband. In
this case report says he is a heavier fish than the
Maoriland rainbow trout. He is a Yorkshireman
with Ever So Much a year, and had a fifty-elephant-
power motor amongst his luggage on the liner.
He got off at Adelaide and asked her Pa. Fa
evidently said “Yes,” because Ever So Much
came back to the liner and bade the crowd con-
gratulate him.
Tenor Newbury arrived by the Asturias on
Saturday, and was bobbing in the surf at Bondi
all Sunday. Newbury, as a footballer, is quite
vain of the fact that he played in the representa-
tive team in Maoriland some years ago. He and
Mrs. Spada-Newbury and a well-known London
organist, Percy Scott, will open at the Town Hall
as soon as the Clara Butt co. is out of the
melodious way.
In one of our sunlit coves of peace, of which
Roderic Quinn sings, and wherein the amateur
fisherman composes the fish-lie which he will later
on lay before his wife, there lives a postmistress
who is suspected of looking hard at the letters she
handles. A visitor to the sunlit-cove place called
at the office for a draper’s parcel, and got it, but
wondered exceedingly how the postmistress knew
it was for her. There was no address on the out-
side. It was on the inside of the packet.
Mr. J. R. Lundon, who is at the Auckland
(M.L.) Bar, and Crown Prosecutor Fraser, of
Dunedin, are in Sydney these first ashen days of
the" Holy Season of Lent. Mr. Ramaciotti, of
Perth, is also here to sample our sackcloth time.
The news that Melba will return liere in March
next, and do a most comprehensive and exhaustive
tour of the Commonwealth, Maoriland, and Tas-
mania, is a surprise. The tour will be managed
by flautist Lemtnone.
It’s.when you read a report like that of St.
Margaret’s Hospital for Women, issued the other
day, that you make up your mind afresh that all
the world isn’t a Stock Exchange. The num-
ber of people who do things for this Hos-
pital, without any other reward than “the
consciousness of good deeds well done,” is legion.
Last year 316 little Australians got their welcome
from St. Margaret’s indoor nurses, and 200 poor
mothers were attended by the outdoor staff ; and,
besides all that, there were over 2000 medical and
surgical cases—mostly in the poor parts of Surry
Hills, Redfern and thereabouts, where the draggled,
grimy terraces follow, row upon row. Half-an-
hour on a hot morning I spent trying to find out
the cost of all this fine, valuable service—the labor
cost, I mean. “Fish, eggs and vegetables” I
can trace; they cost £9O for the indoor
and £36 for the outdoor patients. But all I could.,
make the wages and salaries run up to was £ls2
including the window-cleaner’s remuneration and
the honorarium of the dust-gentleman. All the
doctors give free services to St. Margaret's—and to
Australia so far as St. Margaret’s serves it —and
nine-tenths of the nursing is done on the same
terms. It is good service too, as the records
prove. Still, there are expenses (rent alone costs
£520 a year), and funds are scarce, even if good
wishes and thanks are plentiful. In fact, when
the hospital’s year ended, all there was in the
cupboard was £B7 14s. 9d. But the friends of the
Hospital never have driven it to turn a patient
away, and they are not likely to let it spoil that
record this year.
Australian gems loaned to the Australian Govern-
ment by Messrs. Fairfax and Roberts for show
at the Franco-Britannic Exhibition ought to cause
some inquiries re the whereabouts of Australia.
Black opals—mysterious, gloomy-looking gems,
until light from various angles strikes them
and brings out fire and fury and a riot
of color—have gone. These are found only
in Australia and Brazil. Australian diamonds,
topazes, and emeralds will glitter on our behalf
in the dulness of the Great Blot City.
A letter from Brisbane :
The day following last Government House ball in
Chelmsford’s realm, the wife of Premier Kidston was a
sad and stricken woman. Mrs. -“Wully” is a quiet,
pleasant Scotch body who would rather stay in her modest
cottage home than tread the giddy whirl of fashion, hut
a sense of duty is strong within her ; and to do “ Wully ”
proud at the vice-regal hop, she indulged in the luxury
of a real ball dress, in which fawn and blue formed
the color scheme. She even, for the first time in
her life, had a minute piece scooped out of the
neck, hut when she put the gown on she was
so amazed at her own temerity that she covered over the
hare inches with a wrap of some sort. Arrayed in all
this unaccustomed finery, she appeared in the ballroom
rather a lonely figure, for she is a woman whose reserved
nature makes social intercourse difficult; moreover, she
does not dance, and would not even walk through
the vice-regal set. She was so unobtrusive that she
escaped the notice of the army of social reporters.
Therefore it happened that when Mrs. Kidston opened her
papers next day she read, in the brilliant account of the
shivoo, that she had graced the scene in—“ handsome
black silk ; ” “ rich black satin ; ” and “ soft black chiffon
taffeta.” Then tears of vexation came to her eyes. “ I
might just as well have worn the old black silk frock I’ve
worn everywhere since Wully was made Premier,” she
confided to a friend, “ and I’d have been much happier in
it, tlie new one is cut so terribly low. But after going to
all the trouble to get a pretty frock, it is hard that I
wasn’t noticed."
One of the erring journalists to whom the mistake was
pointed out said she lioped there wouldn’t be any trouble
in the office over the bloomer—they’d already' had ten
infuriated letters from people whose names and dresses
had been omitted from the list. “ But it would be sheer
ingratitude on the part of the Premier’s wife to turn
rusty,” said the enterprising scribe, “for I’ve been so
good to her about that bonnet she has been wearing ever
since she became Premieress. It’s black-and-pink, and
I’ve rung- tlie changes on it so often that my pen
begins to kick when it comes to it. At a hospital
meeting in the morning it is black tulle and
roses. The same afternoon, at a Mayoress’s reception,
the roses become carnations, and on the next occasion
the tulle evolves into chiffon or bombazine, or any other
material I know how to spell. I’ve even found myself
laying awake at night thinking out a new phrase for
the pinnacle. So surely she won’t turn me up for
tliis. Besides, who u ould e\ er dream she would get anew
dress, anyhow ?”
Thus “Mario,” from Brisbane:—
The rain, which has a nasty habit of descending at the
wrong time and place, came down in a nicely-arranged
drizzle, and completely damped the glory of the opening
of Parliament on Wednesday. Even the usually jovial
9th A.It.A. officers looked dejected and depressed
as they clanked along as body guards. Most 0 f
the real sightseers stayed away. The Ministers'
wives and those of the newly-elected members
who had to go and see dear John or James
sworn in, had a bad time of it. A few favored souls were
permitted to flow into the Council Chamber at 11.15
but the miserable, yellow-ticketed rag-tag and bob-tail
were forced to stand round an unsheltered door until
11.40 in the pitiless drip, drip, drip, that simply defied
•“ brollies ” and wraps, and reduced silks and chiff.
fons to a gluey ruin. Lady Chelmsford wore a
really charming gown of grey hailstone crbpe and a smart
hat of grey chiffon and La France roses. Among other
notable frockers, Mrs. Hawthorne, in cream chiffon
glace and web, and Mrs. C. Buchanan (our new and
dainty little Mayoress), in pale blue taffeta and filet net
with a “pinky rosy” hat, were about the most success!
ful opponents of the elements.
There was the inevitable reception upon His Interfering
German Majesty’s war sloop Condor on Thursday. It was
verv much like other such things, only I loved the giddy
little tails to the middy’s caps. Our very own Dr. Ilirschfeld,
with his bland missus, smiled his wide smile amid the
garnishings, and indulged in the official “ Hoch !” in
the wardroom. It was all very nice, very beery, very Ger-
man, and Commander Ahlert and his merry men had
just that same winning naval way. Ach ! Likewise
hoch !
Our woman medico, Dr. Lilian Cooper, with the S.
Prev. Cruelty heroine, Miss Bedford, as mate, is cooling
herself down amid the snows of Kiama. Are there any
snows at Kiama, or does it merely run to a Ghost and a
Blowhole ?
A whisper reaches me of a new crisis in connection
with the She Club here, which I hear is in low water.
The committee and officers are so silent that you could
hear a germ breathing, but there are dark rumors of the
unpaid subscriptions of well-to-do women, which circum-
stances are said to have disgusted the rest of the mem-
bers, aggravated the committee, and put the club in an
orifice. And yet £1 2s. doesn’t seem a terrible call upon
a Society purse.
Another of Brisbane’s last season’s buds has, I hear,
become the ownest own of a young English squatter on
the Downs.
Weddings which are looming nigh include those of
pretty Lulu Hickson and a son of the Flower clan, and
Miss E. Cullen with her station owner.
The Sydney swimmers arrived here on Friday—a fine
buxom iot of lasses. They were received in official wel-
come by chubby Mayor Buchanan and his wife on Satur-
day forenoon. By" the way, it is dawning slowly hut
surely on Brisbane that, in getting the young
Buchanan couple into the civic chair, they hate
done a good deed—specially with “gran’ma” and the
pretty aunts (who are to be subject matter for a
double wedding in June) at their backs. But to return
to your swimmers. They carried off the Australian
championship, Miss M. Wylie being first and Miss Hill
runner-up. The carnival, which took place in the
Booroodabin and was restricted to lady spectators only,
drew a huge crowd and no end of enthusiasm.
Yours Affectionately,
AKENKHI.

MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, March 9, 1908.
Mr Dear Yarrie,—
Quite the most sensational moments in the
“Block” day are provided by the Siren. The
Siren is the young person whom dowdy matrons
refer to as “that woman !” The Siren has got
the gift of Clothes, without a doubt, and she also
has astoundingly thin legs (en passant, I daily say
a litany of thanksgiving, because Clothes cover a
multitude of shins. When one is hovering round
the awful day which completes 35 years, shins are
no longer a pride—they become a mere pair of
props and an infliction. Their outlines get to
look like the shape of an introspective female
mind). The Siren, however, wears the daintiest
gowns—white muslin chimeras over pink silk
realities, with coral jewels, and a joyous aureole
of laoe and pale roses, and many more exquisite
things. But whatever she wears, it serves no better
purpose than the subtle one of revelation. (Any
wise woman knows that a roundabout revelation
of her worst misdemeanor is better received than
a oandid statement.) The gorgeous gowns are
always hoisted high enough to show sheeny silk
stockings on the most immaterial legs in the
world—stockings of virgin blue, of imperial
purple, of plaintive pink, and sinister green (a
dreadful morbid shade with a sheen over it!), and
of white just faintly flushed with the tint of the
warm flesh beneath ; and gay glowing yellows, and
fierce strident reds, and stockings whereof the
silk is heliotrope, like faded orchids. And
the lady of the legs parades with calm insouciance,
knowing no more than that her hose attract much
notice. She doesn’t know how those bedizened
shins murder illusions as they pass. And she
hasn’t any idea that she looks like an allegory of
the eternal discrepancy between the woman and
What the woman looks like.
Saturday saw the steeplechase—the last day of
theV.R.C. autumn racing. A big crowd went
out. It was a sweltering day with a north wind
blowing, but women are the most amazing
creatures when it conies to Dress. By all prece-
dent it should be cooler autumn weather. They
had their new autumn toggery. Ergo, they
wore their autumn toggery, even unto velvet.
The heat made the bought pink to trickle off
worried countenances, and the unbought purple to
fly into place, while|the north wind shrivelled and
the dust settled heavily on a harried and unhappy
herd of feminines.
There was a suggestion of the curious cut
of new coatlets, destined for the New Figure.
By winter time and the June meeting we’ll
all be a new shape. Heaven or Art alone
knows how, but it has been done before
this marvellous remodelling and can be
done again. No more hunohed-up hips and
generous ourves. Straight and slanting are now
the board-like lines of inexorable tailoring. The
fashionable she will be a willowy wand or a
wafty sapling—a mere stem to carry a head like a
huge petaled flower, with its cart-wheel of hat and
hair.
The parsley crown for the race-frocking was
taoitly awarded to the womenkind of the book-
making Allen family. “ Mrs. Barney,” of that
ilk, made her highest score in a gown of cream
chiffon, flowered with orange roses. A lidful of
lace and feathers crowned the beauteous dame.
A handsome sister-in-law did her duty to the
vanities in a ninon, striped black and white, with
frock-long insertions of pleated flame-pink
chiffon, and a hat like one of Phoebus’ buggy
wheels. Yet another Allen missus made a
plunge in a mass of grey and black embroi-
deries, with much dainty white on head and gown.
Mrs. Laurie Harris was one more of the odds-
calling coterie’s nominees for the frock stakes.
She sidled through the Australian Cup Day in a
chiffon draping that looked like moss roses made
into a race-dress. And dozens of women who
regard betting as a big black blotted sin watched
the quartette, and wished to goodness that their
husbands made a book instead of being church-
wardens.
Bess Norris, the Australian artist, has just had
a portrait accepted by the Kaiserin, through the
Princess Louise. This Princess has taken a very
kindly interest in the clever miniature painter.
The Princess lady’s chief guard of honor, or aide-
de-camp, or leading swash-buckler, is Captain
Probert, who was Help to an Australian Governor
heretofore, and says he feels like an Australian
himself. He proved a brick, or even a corner-
stone, in helping Miss Norris to notice.
Lady Northcote and also the minor G. Talbottle
Dame have promised to personally see “ As You
Like It ” through on Saturday (14th). The per-
formance is to be on the lawn of the Ross-Soden
“Mandeville Hall.” The Melbourne and St. Kilda
Shakspearian Societies find the cast. The play is
to be illustrated with old English Morris dances by
Florrie-Green dancers, and Prof. Sugden is help-
ing along the musical part. The show is to assist,
and give a financial leg up to, the young and
struggling Queen Victoria Hospital for Women.
Said that in peaceful and holy Adelaide one of
the Fiji cricketers took unto himself much whisky,
and within him rose the spirit of his ancestors’
while the ponderosity of the “ British Constitu-
tion” faded to a film, and the yelling brownie
went off on a fiery jamboree. He held up the
hotel for a while, and manager Marsden had all
he could do—so ’tis said—to get our brown brother
away to Melbourne peaceably. Of course, English
cricketers get drunk too at times (as Captain
Jones could tell if he would open his heart about
his worries), but white-man drunk is somehow
different from savage drunk, and some of Adelaide
was a good deal abroad.
A dame who shortly returns to her native heath
in a stage capacity is booked to play lead in a
.divorce case. The husband applies fora cancella-
tion of the marriage-contract. Said that all the
usual appanages of polite drama will figure in the
production (of evidence)—footmen, housemaids,
and the light-comedy friend of the family.
The latest announced emigrants for London are
the Lansells, of Bendigo. A whole regiment of
golden girls and their dearest chum, Miss Penfold,
face the storms and prawns and terrors of an
ocean voyage in a mail steamer, under mamma
Lansell’s chaperonage. The Lansell misses will
be presented at Court if all goes as well as they
expect. Another trio of girls who go “abrawd ”
•with their mother are the Wesley-Halls. Much
gold, made out of raining, will be flung round
London by the deceased miners’ relicts —and all
for the sake of Sassiety.
Theatre-goers are much favored these nights.
As Suburbia trundles home in full dress and a
fearful hurry, full of “A Beautiful Fiend,” or
“Charley’s Aunt,” it’s sure to encounter Florence
Baines driving home. The plump comedienne
uses an open carriage, and drives imperially
through the crowded streets in full view. She
wears deluding black—like all sensible heavy-
weights—plentifully punctuated with diamonds,
and is barricaded behind floral trophies.
Mr. Yon Dechend, the decorative scholar who
expounds German literature at Melbourne Uni-
versity, retires into matrimony shortly. The lady
who will accompany him is Miss Curran, a, Tas-
manian blue-stocking, who—so say some unbiassed
auditors—is the cleverest and most charming girl
in the island, and knows how to keep quiet in
three living and two dead languages. Which
promises that for once we’re going to see an ideal
union.
The Victorian Amateur Athletic Association
runs a “Marathon Display,” at the Masonic Hall,
on Friday, 20th March. The profits will go to-
wards sending George Blake and W. V. Aitken
to England to take part in the Olympian Games.
George Blake, who struck a sixth place in the
Marathon Race at the last big Muscle Meeting,
is expected to do very large things by his next
effort.
T’other day, Miss Estelle McGee, the youngest
daughter of Mrs. J. W. McGee, of Warrnambool
and Armadale, took a lord and master in the per-
son of A. Douglas Ford. The damsel assumed
her new responsibilities in Holy Angels’ Church
—which strikes one’s ear with a nice whir of
feathered wings and white petticoats.
Surgeon Tom Fitzgerald is still very ill, and
is being most devotedly nursed by his daughter.
It must be pretty awful when a high-priced healer
has a pain of his own, and can’t cure it. But his
philosophy is said to be of the Stoic variety.
By the way, it is said that Surgeon Fitzgerald
has returned to the R.C. fold after over thirty
years’ wandering. The surgeon, report goes, sent
for Archbishop Carr, and peace was restored.
At the far end of the ’nineties, I was at a concert
where the Hopetoun couple were in evidence.
The sombre countess was presented with the
usual bouquet by a very fat, small girl. Later on,
the fat infant wandered up to the lady and said :
“ Let me sit on your knee!” She was elevated
to a white satin lap, where she prattled quietly to
an accompaniment of the lady’s laughter. Said
the infant: “I don’t like Scotchmen —they don’t
love God !” Said the dame: “But Lord Hope-
toun is a Scotchman ! ” “ Yes, poor man,” sighed
the baby, “ but he can’t help that.” And neither
he could. It was the only fault he had which
hurt anyone.
The latest development of the Ballarat mystery
—a mere side detail, so to speak—concerns fossicker
Arthur Deevar, the discoverer of the body in the
shaft. He has written to the Melbourne papers,
complaining that “the people of Ballarat are
accusing him of knowing more than he has told
about the tragedy, and have talked of him in such
a way as to separate him from his wife.” He now
casts the mud of Ballarat from his boots, and goes
to live with his “ dear old mother and sister at
Footscray,” while his young wife Lily has de-
parted the Lord knows whither. It hasn’t trans-
pired how Ballarat’s conversation led to the rup-
ture between Arthur and Lily; but Ballarat has
evidently been talking a good deal. Meanwhile,
Mr. lies keeps a great silence.
Mrs. O’Malley, wife of Captain Charlie of the
Middlesex regiment, who has been in England for
some years, returns with her small son for a short
visit to her relations in Melbourne. Mrs.
O’Malley is remembered as Eily Spark, one of the
lucky grandchildren of the rich Pat O’Brien.
The McEacharns, just returned, secured a
whole suite of rooms on the Asturias—not cabins
—and did things in right royal style. Madeline,
the younger daughter, who had not tucked up her
hair when she left, has grown into a tall, hand-
some girl with plenty of dash and go. She rears
up her fine, well-poised head as if she knew the
value of her wealth and the position she will hold
as the wife of a Heron-Maxwell. The McEacharns
have taken up their residence at “Goathlands,”
Kew, for the few months they are here. They
return again next year for the winding-up of the
Watson estate.
The Melbourne Savages fought the Fijian
savages at cricket last Thursday, on the little
East Melbourne ground. It was scarcely cricket
within the meaning of the Act, but was a color-
mixed corroboree. Pope (no relation of the
Tivoli coon), the beauty man of the Fijians, did not
play, but had a great innings with the white
girl. One of the Fijians is in a delirious whirl
at the attentions of so many white women.
He gets a letter every second day from an Ade
laide “ Sassiety ” maiden who took him motoring,
tea-ed with him, and even made him her
“double” in a mixed bathe or so during the South
Australian trip. “Oh the lovely Bright Eyes !’’
chortles the cocoanut-oiled. “ I’ll get a white
wife yet for Fiji.”
The Northcotes have been wading in at the Fox
picture show with a, good stout cheque book.
Four sketches of Venice are among their booty.
Rumor speaks quite insistently of the matri-
monial shackles of a very round and jolly Aide
and one of Melbourne’s beauty girls—a girl with
Money and a Motor. Lucky dog! Beauty,
youth, a heart's affection, money, and a Motor !
Mrs. Gregor Wood and Mr. Gregor Wood
(Mister comes second, like a good, meek husband)
advertise a vocal recital at Glen’s Concert Hall,
on Thursday, March 19. Horace Gleeson
will hold down the piano. “ Bertie ” Zelman
will be solo violinist.
The Mayoral Weedons went out in a storm of
flattering gush, before a fusillade of verbal
bouquets. The gaud Mayor got much praise for
lots of little things which he should not have done,
and his missus got a gorgeous diamond tiara for
having stopped him doing many more. These
are the only feasible explanations one can
offer for sundry official presentations and much
superfluous kowtow. Himself hopes to make
a huge success as Victoria’s chosen chatterer
at the Anglo-Franco Exhibition. His local per-
formances in the oratorical line don’t encourage
the unbiassed to hope that he’ll eclipse our
Alfred, or anything like that. Herself wants to
be presented—but, ’tis said, Trade makes an
unsurmountable barrier ’twixt Talma’s and the
Throne, as if the Throne and the peerage steps
thereto were not all matters of trade these times.
“Lafayette” Brewster’s eldest daughter changed
her name and address the other day, when she
became Mrs. Harold Roberts. The transition
was effected at the Australian Church. Ihe
church, which is made sombre by the shadows of
surrounding buildings, was penetrated by a
single ray of sunlight, which stretched golden
fingers only as far as the bride’s blonde head, and
rested there like a bright brown blessing.
From “Rosna,” who leads her unobtrusive
existence at Adelaide :
His Ex., in company with Professor Stirling and his
brother, has been down in the region of our solitary
volcano, pursuing the frisky quail. All the local peerage
rushed out in a body and told him he might fire at every
bird on its ancestral acres, including the house-cat.
Melba paid a flying visit to the Children’s Hospital the
morning of her departure for Britain, and carried a book,
duly inscribed, to each of the small inmates who had
taken her fancy. One was an unfortunate kiddy who has
been in the hospital ever since Melba’s last visit to this
country. A second was the eldest boy in the Institution ;
and a third was a determined particle of femininity who
firmly refused to sing to the Voice. Evidently Melba has
been sung at so strenuously by young applicants for
vocal honors that the refusal became a virtue in her eyes.
She had previously bestowed tickets for her second con-
cert on a bevy- of the nurses, therefore she is much
adored at that institution—of which, by the way, she is a
life Governor or Governoress.
A wild agricultural show struck Adelaide last week,
and Mr. Jack Oreswell lassoed the beast with a skilful
hand and put it through its paces. It evoked the usual
outburst of country cousins, the usual overcrowding of
our beauteous horse-trams, and the usual profane lan-
guage on the part of the stationary population. Inci-
dentally, there were more entries than ever before, and the
shekel was set a-rolling satisfactorily. I believe the
original shekel was such an angular coin that it wouldn’t
roll (at least it wouldn’t roll away from the Hebrew) ;
but what does it matter?
Just in time to provide a little stimulating and moral
entertainment for the great Hayseed family down for the
Show, “The Message from Mars” arrived at the Theatre
Royal. The Hayseeds sat in gaping rows every night,
and wept a little, and said it was a be-autiful piece. Then
they went out and gave a whole penny to the first blind
man they met.
Adelaide is just now trying to claim a little stray fame
by proxy. Dr. Edward Naylor, of Cambridge, whose
opera, “ The Angelus,” has secured the Ricordi prize of
£5OO from 191 competitors, is a brother of Professor
Darnley Naylor, who dispenses English Literature at
Adelaide ’Varsity.
Yet another member of the Cremation Society has pro-
vided employment for our under-worked baking house—
solicitor N. A. Knox, of the firm of Knox, Gwvnne and
Hargrave, who passed out last week, aged 71. Mr. Knox
had lived in South Oss sinGe 1850, and was a shining light
of the Theosophical Society and various other bodies.
His widow is a daughter of the late Justice Gwynne.
A new roller-rink has arisen, phcenix-like, from the
ashes of the old Glaciarium, with a specially-constructed
and utterly-utter floor, built of asphalt or* such. It’s a
vast improvement on the ancient variety of board floor,
being much smoother and productive of less unholy
racket. The populace has taken to it very kindly, «ind
slithereth every day. Our new Mayor, Mr. Frank John-
son, committed the opening ceremony, with the usual
decorative speeches, and a string band made music, and
quite a number of people tumbled on their craniums.
Among the few scions of the frocky sex who ventured on in
the crowd were pretty little Mrs. Dave Fulton and Miss
Melrose, both experts in the sliding art ; also one of the
younger Hill damsels, a charmer of considerable grace.
The rink proposes to burst into a fancy-dress carnival on
April 1, pending which event we slither assiduously.
Yours affectionately,
JONVHNA.
In the action for alleged libel, Roberts v.
The Bulletin, heard in the Sydney District
Court on Monday, Judge Rogers gave a ver-
dict against The Bulletin for 405., and urged
from the very outset of the case that the
paper must apologise to Mr. Roberts for say-
ing that he was “ sacked ” from the Government
Service. Mr. Roberts’ own account of how .he
came to leave is : “I was called into a
small room and told by some person that
I was to leave the office at once, and
not come near it till requested.” That was in
1889; and he has not been requested to come
since. The right J udge Rogers has to order The
Bulletin to apologise is probably as slight as his
appreciation of plain English ; but since this
paper doesn’t wish, and never did wish, to hurt
Mr. Roberts’ feelings in any way, it expresses
regret for the “sacked,” and substitutes his own
account of how he came to leave the Public
Service.
Last Tuesday’s Star contained these few
items or rumors (1) That Carruthers will pro-
bably resume the N.S. W. Premiership on his return
from England ; (2) that Wade will then probably
appoint himself Chief Justice; (3) that the Treasury
is paying Carruthers’ expenses to England ; (4) that
the paper had failed to find out from Wade how
much Carruthers is being paid ; (5) that there are
already rows between Chief Railway Commis-
sioner Johnson and Commissioner Kirkcaldie.
The good effect of the new tariff is again
in evidence—this time in the rubber industry.
Mr. J. P. Wallace, late managing director of the
Continental C. and G. Rubber Co., Melbourne
(head office in Hanover, Germany), has retired
from that concern, and is expending money and
energy in developing rubber mills bearing his
own name at Windsor, Victoria.
Solemn Lee, the N.S.W. Minister for
Works, must have felt quite Cheerful Lee after
he had read a report furnished by his officers
regarding the Fitzroy Dock the other day. The
Mort s Dock people had broken out into another
series of growls about State Interference with
Private Enterprise, whereupon Solemn Lee called
for a return showing how much and by whom the
State s dock had been use d during (i) last year,
and (2) the last five years. To which the State
dock s managing committee replied, showing that
of five private vessels docked during 1907 three
had been admitted on the requisition of the Mort’s
Oock people themselves, while of 24 vessels
docked during five years past no less than 17 had
been taken in to oblige Mort’s Dock. Now it is
up to the Mort’s Dock man to explain what he is
grumbling about.

Another Private Enterprise tramway co. hag
had trouble with its employees—that of Ballarat
to wit. Its conductors work 54 hours a week fo'
an average of 205., and the ungrateful fellows
think that that is not enough money. When the
Amending Factories Bill was before the Vj c
Assembly last session, several Labor members
wanted provision to be made for a Wages Board
for tramway employees ; but the Ministry and its
majority, thinking only of the big Melbourne co.
and remembering its promised reduction of hours,
rejected the amendment, so the Ballarat eonduc'
tors, failing a request for an increased wage, had
no other remedy than a strike.


VICTORIA and the Anglo-
FrencH Exhibition.
FOR a number of years Victoria has been called “ The Garden State of Australia,” and the
proof of this is self-evident, as area for area it distances by far every other State in the Com-
monwealth, not only in population, but in every branch of agricultural production and
industry, and although with its 14 people to the square mile it is the most densely populated State of
the Commonwealth, it is very sparsely populated in comparison with the countries of the old world.
There are 558 people to the square mile in England and Wales, 137 in Ireland, and 150 in
Scotland, so it is obvious that m a country so thinly settled as Victoria there is ample room for a
large increase of population. W ith a total area of 56,245,760 acres, the number of farms only
reaches 52,987 ; but the splendid producing capacity of the soil is such that no less a sum than
£>22>i 17,043 was last year produced under this head alone, and this represents an average of
per farm. Another phase of the marvellous productive capacity of Victoria is shown in the follow-
ing table :

Whilst the value of the Gold which has been raised in Victoria from 1851 to 1906
amounted to
Up to 1851 only two industries were in active operation-—wool-raising and
gold-mining; but when the deposits of gold, which were within easy reach of the
surface, were becoming worked out, the population was forced to take up agricul-
tural industries, and it was then found that the soil of Victoria wa<* equal to any
other in the world. Of the total area about one-fifth consists of low mountain
ranges running east and west through the centre of the State, gradually ascending
until they reach an average elevation of about 2000 ft., and from these to the north
and south stretch volcanic and alluvial plains and tablelands to the River Murray
and the Southern Ocean respectively. The ranges of hills were originally
covered with a heavy growth of timber, but wherever this timber has been cleared
off it has been found that on the slopes and also in the valleys almost
every kind of European fruit trees will yield prolific returns. Nearly all
the remaining area is fit for some branch or other of agricultural industry.
The climate is equable, there are no extremes of heat and cold, and the rainfall
averages 25*61 inches per annum. Work can be carried on out of doors almost
every day in the year, snow is practically unknown, and cattle and sheep run in the
open all the year round, whilst in many instances they are fattened for market on
the natural grasses alone. Permanent rivers flow north and south from the ranges,
and, where the rainfall is at all uncertain, these rivers have been made the head
waters of irrigation systems which are fast covering the whole of the cultivable
northern areas. The rainfall in the south is such that irrigation is unnecessary.
Of the total area of the State (56,245,760 acres), 27,521,890 acres have been
disposed of, 5,333,609 acres are held under various kinds of leases, and 10,632,221
acres have been set apart for roads, reserves, etc., leaving a balance of 12,758,040
acres still in the hands of the Crown. The number of holdings in 1905 were dis-
tributed as follows: —Up to 100 acres, 18,342 ~ } from 100 to 320 acres, 15,414 j
from 321 to 500 acres, 5349 and over 500 acres, 13,393. Prom
this it will be seen that by far the most popular sizes of hold-
ing are from 100 to 320 acres, and on farms of these sizes under the present
np-to-date systems of agriculture, thousands of families have established comfortable
homes. The land industries are so varied, embracing wheat, wool, dairy pioduce,
lamb-raising for export, wine, fruit, meal, poultry, root crops, flax, timber, tobacco,
and numberless minor products, that a most promising field is available for the
employment of additional capital and labor. The latent wealth of the country is
onl y just being developed. Considerable areas of virgin land (both Crown
and freehold) have yet to be brought under cultivation, and become a
revenue-producing element both to the farmer and to the State. An
active policy of land resumption is being carried out by the State,
whereby large areas of most fertile land are being resumed by
the Government, and subdivided in farms ranging up to £l5OO in value. The
transport facilities are unequalled in any other country in the world, it being a
difficult matter to get to a point 15 miles distant from a railway line, the whole of
which are the property of the State (incidentally it might be mentioned that the
average freight to the seaboard on a bushel of wheat is 3|d., and the average dis-
tance to a seaport is 135 miles).
With such manifold advantages as the foregoing, the Bent Government wisely
decided to make an effective display at the forthcoming Exhibition in London.
Specimens of every agricultural, horticultural, and viticultural product will be
exhibited ; samples of Cheese, Butter, Fruit, Wheat, Barley, and all other products
will be attractively arranged. Thousands of Pictures, illustrating agricultural
life in all its branches will be on view to illustrate not only to the farmer
what the land is capable of producing, but also to the oversea buyer of export produce
the quality of the various articles raised in the State. Freezing chambers will be
erected, so that experts may judge for themselves the size and quality of the
perishable products Victoria ships to the shores of Old England, whilst the
Education, Mines, and Railways Departments each have only too small a space to
justifiably display their effects.
Immigrants with some capital and accustomed to agricultural pursuits
will, from the display sent from the Crown Lands Department and the Closer
Settlement office, be enabled to fully understand the various methods of sub-
division and sale of Crown Lands, special feature being made of the Closer
Settlement administration. Thousands of post cards illustrating farm life
in every branch have been sent on ; various illustrated and attractively
designed pamphlets will be distributed daily. Thousands of maps, showing
the various uses to which the lands of the State are at present being put,
the rainfall, positions of State schools, systems of water-supply—whether irrigation,
stock, or domestic supplies, the railway systems, and numberless other items, for
the purpose of disseminating information of the productive and other values of the
State as a whole.
The distribution of these pamphlets, etc., will, it is considered, go a long way towards teaching the
people of England, Scotland and Ireland that Victoria is not a land of everlasting drought and bush
fires, but, on the other hand, A LAND OF PROMISE, where the enterprising, willing and
industrious worker may, during the years of his life when he is most fitted to labor, store up ior
himself the means to maintain himself comfortably in his old age.

For Your Mind
There is a time-worn saying that “ Salesmen
are born—not made!”
The first part of that saying is true, and will
always be true. The phenomenon of being born
seems to be common to all men, salesmen included.
Sheldon holds, however, that Salesmen are
“ made ” as well as born, and he has proved his
claim in thousands of cases. He holds that even
the “born” Salesman can be made stronger by
his system of true education—that no Salesman
is so good he cannot become better.
A Sale is a mental thing or process—the intelli-
gent co-operation of one mind with another. A
sale is brought about, therefore, not by technical
knowledge alone, but by the power of persuasion
—the ability to persuade another to your way of
thinking. And the power to persuade is the
result of a masterful personality and of that only.
Salesmanship is a profession, and the highest
paid of all professions. There is more money in
selling than in anything else— if you can sell.
Salesmen virtually set their own salaries, because
they are producers ; and in proportion as they
produce are they paid.
On the salesman—the business man—there are
no limits set. As he can produce, in that pro-
portion can he take. Wealth—material power—
and all the good things that go with them, await
the man who can learn to be a great salesman—the
man who can create business.
But this wonderful power to create business—
this masterful personality that persuades —from
where does it come ? It comes from the man him-
self, from the development of the latent forces
within him. All growth is from within outward.
All successful men are men of strong personality.
And all normal men have the material out of
which to develop strong personality.

affords just what is needed-privacy, convenience, and comfort.
The Roll Top Desk is the high-water mark of desk development,
and with its lock drawers, pigeon-holes directly within reach, and roll
curtain to pull down over papers, ensuring that they will remain
undisturbed and free from dust, it is little wonder the modern man of
affairs feels that he cannot do without one. Write for our catalogue
of special values in desks of all kinds. We both manufacture locally,
and import direct from foreign makers.
Safes.
To carry on business without a Fire-Proof Safe amounts to some-
thing like criminal negligence. Records, private papers, books of account,
receipts, etc., should be protected. The value of insurance depends upon
its collection, and where the records of a business have been destroyed
by fire, it is impossible to establish a claim. A good safe prevents all
confusion and loss. Our safes have a record of nearly 40 years in Aus-
tralasia, and they are better now than ever before. Write for catalogue.
Typewriters.
The Briton is a standard machine improved by simplicity, Universal
keyboard— improved escapement—automatic ribbon movement. Swift
strong and silent. Write for terms and full description. Agents wanted
in unallotted territory.
Systems.
A card or filing system to be valuable to you must be made to
fit your business as far as possible. These systems are very simple, and
save hours of useless worry, and prevent hundreds of delays and errors.
We manufacture and import Cabinets of all kinds, and design and
install systems for all purposes. Write for the details of advantage that
these modern appliances afford. Catalogues, etc., free of charge.

“ H.S.R.” : Wade (B. 6/2/’08), re municipal trad-
ing, quotes Avebury, late Lubbock. It was he who said, in
answer to a letter about the nationalisation of railways,
that he “ didn’t approve of the idea, as where it had been
tried it didn’t seem to be a success.” A fine authority is
Avebury. But as to “disastrous municipal trading.”
Take gas for an example. There are 260 municipal g-as
undertakings in the United Kingdom. Capital invested,
£117,103,279. Amount repaid, £13,992,360. Gross profit,
£2,637,677. That is a profit of 7 per cent. The muni-
cipalities charge on an average 3Jd. less than private
cos. per 1000 ft. for gas, work their men shorter hours, and
pay higher wages. Also even the six undertakings out of
the 260 which are supposed to be showing a loss, pay well
enough to provide fir payment of interest, and repay-
ment of borrowed capital. Added to all, in a certain
number of years the undertakings become the absolute
property of the ratepayers. Municipal trading, of course,
is disastrous—to the predatory parasites.
“ J.A.C.”; Have lately heard of two authentic
instances of good hard cheek on the part of the real
estate person. One is the case of a person who rented a
house in Brisbane. The place was in a dilapidated con-
dition, and the head of the family had it re-papered and
re-painted at his own expense. When the landlady called
for the rentshe expressed herself delighted with the look
of the place. “ Such an improvement,” she said ; and next
v'eek she raised the rent on account of the increased value
of the property. The other case is that of a musician,
well known in Sydney, who rented a suburban villa. He
thought the verandah looked dingy, and had it painted,
at a cost of £3 10s. The following week the landlady
gave him notice to quit. Attracted by the bright aspect
of the house, someone had offered a higher rent.

“Mirumbeck ” : Took mv stand in my country
jeweller’s sight-testing parlor, t’other off-day, to wait his
pleasure while he attended at his sales counter. The
customer with sore, red-raw eyes wanted a pair of colored
glasses. The goggles tray was produced. The sore-eved
one wished to fit on every pair of glasses on that tray ;
but the seller never relinquished his grip on each pair,
and never held them nearer .than two inches. Half-an-
hour was consumed in fixing that fidget.. Next customer
was the police magistrate who visits Drunkville monthly.
He had lost the stud that fixed the back of his collar.
Jeweller produced a tray—containing ten gross, I
fancy. P.M. handled every stud—long ones, short ones,
tipsy ones, nearl-backed ones. Then he bought two
“ bones ” for 3d. Time wasted, so far, three-quarters of
an hour. The third customer was a parent with a short-
sighted lass ; the frames-of her glasses were fractured in a
vital spot. Paterfamilias started off by explaining how his
pride and joy was “ practising the piano ” for an A.N.A.
scuffle, and he wanted the gdasses repaired instanter.
Jeweller pleaded that he had a customer (me) waiting
with a two-guinea order—an hour at least would pass
before he could handle solders, acids, etc., etc. Pater-
familias argued—pleaded. His poor child was absolutely
helpless without her glasses. Every precious minute
passed without them tended to permanent blindness.
Jeweller relented, and said, seeing it was a case of life or
death, the job would be attended to at once. Then Pater-
familias, as an afterthought, inquired the cost of the trader’s
skill and energy. It would be Is. 6d. “ Eighteentench 1 ”
thundered the doting father ; “ t hat’s daylight robbery ! ”
Jeweller explained the difficulties'of the job—that gold
solder was needed, etc. But to no avail. Paterfamilias
bounced out; he “ would send them to the man in the
city who made ’em—he’d do it for nothing!” After
being fixed up with a pair of blinkers, I went forth to my
bullock-punching, thanking the Fates that I had nothing
to do with the hogs of commerce, who lack the milk of
human kindness, and think every sprat they intend
spending entitles them to an eternal lien on the trader’s
toil and patience. At bullock-punching you can tell the
dumb brutes what you think of ’em, anyway.

“Philo”: The enterprising young man, who
has saved a little money and is anxious to invest it,
should bexvare of the conscienceless ghoul who inserts
alluring advertisements in the daily papers. His methods
are numerous and varied, but are mostly to the effect
that the advertiser requires a partner with about £loo—
he shoots at bigger game—in a very lucrative
venture. Many young men come at the bait, and are
eventually induced by the glowing representations of pro-
spective independence, to invest their savings in some
sort of a business on a partnership basis. The investor
speedily discovers that he cannot make as
of the concern as he would if he were working
for a small salary. The ghoul does none of the
work, and takes no interest in the business, ■ P
to each week claim his share of whatever
profit his victim makes. How long the latter co
to toil for the ghoul depends upon his pertinacity a
common sense, but it is absolutely immaterial
ghoul, who keeps on drawing his share of the P
without doing anything to earn it, and who has
a dozen similar “partnerships” arranged. e . .
business begins to show a hopeless loss, the ghoul ge
of the habit of calling. Eventually, the victim sees
hopelessness of the case, and also ceases to attend at
business address. To attempt to separate the ghoul ironi
the £lOO or so paid for the half-share would be like
attempting to divorce a healthy 10-foot shark from its
bite.

The poor farmer has all along raved that the use
of a 2001 b. wheat-sack in place of the old one built for
2401 b., but mostly carrying 2601 b. odd, would mean a dead
loss to him of about 2d. per bag. Sometimes, in fact, he
raved that it would cost as much as 4d. a bag extra. Yet
it appears, for the present at least, that he "ill actually
save money by using the 2001 b. bag'. Melbourne bag im-
porters quote the new standard bag, 2£lb., at 4s. Sd. per
dozen., a 3 against the old standard sack, weighing 2Jib.,
at 58. s|d. per dozen. Twelve tons of wheat require nine
dozen big bags, costing 495. or eleven dozen of
the smaller bags, which only cost 48s. 7d. So the farmer
will actually save nearly a penny a ton by rising the small
bag, and it won’t cost him as much to handle either.
The Bulletin gets a new kind of circular:
“ Data in support of proposal to erect (or purchase exist-
ing) woollen mills, to be worked under the management
of the late senior partner of Stork Bros., spinners and
weavers, Huddersfield, Yorkshire.” There haven’t been
many circulars like that blowing across Australia. As a
rule, before Protection arrived as a settled thing—and
even now it isn’t high enough in this line —the circular
that did blow across Australia said that somebody in
York-street or Collihs-lahe was just opening a fine range
of imported tweeds, and this poor, helpless country was
invited to come and clothe itself with its own wool mixed
with any old rags dragged out from any old corners of
Europe. Now, however, it is proposed in a tentative way
that Australia shall put its hand in its pocket, not to buy
the product, of foreign mills, but to add another to the
Australian mills; and the scheme ought to be worth
looking into when it is put forward with some more detail.
Certain mean Sydney firms, which when the
shop assistants won their Arbitration award, endeavored
to misuse the year’s grace allowed them to bring their
conditions into harmony with the grading required by
the award, are already looking into the cold eye of a
problem. When the award came into force there was a
considerable sacking of older hands, their places being
filled by raw and cheap recruits —the mistaken “year’s
grace ” allowed this sort of thing to happen. The idea
was not to save money, because the raw' hands were as
expensive as the sacked seniors ; the idea W'as just to show
the seniors w hat a bad thing an aw 7 ard u'as, and prove that
if a minimum wage were established people would be cut
down to that minimum. But other firms which possessed
some foresight started to absorb the best of the seniors ;
and, w'hen the year’s grace has expired, the mean people
will find a shortage of competent seniors, and then they
w ill be sick and sorry. They will be obliged to have a
certain proportion of seniors in order to obey the award,
and the senior hands they will be able to get will be the
least competent, or will be suddenly-promoted juniors.
The newly-established Clerks’ Union, when it tackles its
problem in the Arbitration Court, should fight strenu-
ously against any “ year’s grace ” foolishness.
“Cict”: In current, legislation is there no
clause dealing with those hash-house proprietors who so
persistently mislead their unfortunate patrons into par-
taking of their sixpenny hospitality at a shilling or more
per time? The menu’at the front door proclaims in loud
purple script that steak and kidney pie, fried steak,
boiled and poached steak, roast steak, and bashed steak
are available at the modest sprat, and you glide in.
You hand over your pie order and lounge. After
that a damp kind of man in a pinafore and
a limp hops smilingly into vour notice, and
begs you to confide to him your favorite drink, and you
bawl “coffee!” in a superior kind of tone, like most
people do when getting: something offered them and no
charge mentioned. Meantime your order has cast anchor
and you commence enveloping same. In course of time
your beverage arrives, and disappears almost simultane-
ously, upon which your pal in the lame pinafore begs"
your leave to refill the instrument, and you permit him
in the same superior manner as before. After that a
slip of yellow paper informs you in blue pencil that vou r
feed costs Is. 3d., and you pay it as a matter of courtesy
or something similar.

“Poleaxe” : He’sa useful man, is Sundries, i n
more than a cricket match. Lately, the gay spirits at a
Government office held a “smoke” concert, and the
balance-sheet, duly audited, had only four items on the
expenditure side :
Beer.. -- .. £0 15 0
Miscellaneous .. .. .. 018 9
Broken glasses, etc. .. .. .. 012 3
Sundries .. .. .. ..263

It’s time Sundries had more recognition. Suppose Wade
makes a Minister of him ?
A Territorian, who upholds the total exclusion
of the Asiatic from the North, but who has, by force of
circumstances, to buy the Celestial’s article, received
this from his Chow tailor a little while back :

“Cict”: Wandered into a back-blocks union
temple the other Sunday. Between hymns I took stock
of the kirk fittings and furniture. The lamps on the walls
came from the U.S. A. ; the Oregon pine seats were marked
“ Wun Long and Co., Melbourne the books had been
built in Fleet-street, London ; the collection-trays in Ger-
many, likewise the organ. The ancient upon the stage
clamored frantically in Lowland Scotch to the multitude
to make an extra special effort to swell the funds of
the Chinese Inland Mission, for which a collection was to
be taken up that very morning, and delivered himself
of numerous misstatements re the millions of the yellow
heathen who had already embraced Christianity’. .Sud-
denly in some vague way it was borne in on me that, by
supporting this place, I should be encouraging Babel or
Gomorrah, or some such undesirable Scriptural locality.
So, even as the Teuton-bred offering-plate pulled up in
niy neighborhood, I stumbled over the Norwegian
hassock, and so across the Belgian door-mat into the
Australian-made street.
“ Settler ” writes
I cannot understood why The Bulletin 7 shows more
sympathy with the “ Immigration League of Austral-
asia,” which is the seceding body run by Dr. Arthur
than with the original “ Immigration League of Aus-
tralia,” of which Professor Anderson Stuart is president.
The original league supports The Bulletin’s immigration
policy of confining Government aid to suitable immi-
grants, and pushing on with closer settlement. Dr.
Arthur’s league seems to favor the immigration of all
sorts, even to Russian Jews in bulk, and professes no
sympathy with any plans for making land available for
immigrants.
THE LOCAL FACTOREE.
[FOR THE BULLHTIN.]
He was a man of wide renown,
And Potentate of Cowville Town.
So you may gauge his high degree—
He milked a herd of ninety-thre j.
One day he called his neighbors round.
We rallied as in duty bound,
And learned the Sydney parasites
No more would rob us of our rights;
For he’d conceived the brilliant scheme
Whereby we’d sell ourselves our cream,
“ And ’stablish in our midst,” said he,
“ The Cowville Butter Factor-ee ! ”
He w r as a man of wide renown,
This boss Jay Pea of Cowville Town.
The shares sold out in half-an-hour,
And w'hen we’d raised a storage tower,
We held a grand inaug’ral spree.
Our chairman was the boss Jay Pea,
And in a manner sunnnaree
His son was made our secret-ree ;
And of the workers, fully half
Of Cowville’s staff
Who came to earn our dividends
Were distant relatives and friends.
And Chairman of Directors, he,
Promoter of our Factoree.
He was a man of wide renown,
And boss Jay Pea of Cowville Town.
Our cream shop ran from year to year,
Though why or wherefore wasn’t clear.
For ne’er a Dividend we got.
The Exes, swelled. The “ test” did not—
In fact, it was the other way
(The chairman’s “ test ” went up, they say).
Our promised Bonus never came—
We couldn’t understand the game,
And thought it wasn’t worth the grass
When cream got graded “Second class.”
Not so our worthy chairman—he
Swore by the Cowville Factor-ee ;
He was a man of wide renown,
And boss Jay Pea of Cowville Town.
But when it always came to pass
Our cream kept grading “ Second-class,”
We held a hot and sharp debate.
The manager, he begged to state
The thing was caused, in his esteem,
By our supplying dirty cream.
Next week we sent some stuff to town ;
The chairman sneered: “ They’ll take you down 1’
But our returns, in black and white,
Showed “Superfine.” The “ test” was right;
Ten pounds of butter to the can
More than we got from Cowville’s man.
I saw th“ boss Jay Pea that night,
And, sad to state, he dealt out fight.
I told him he was in the swim,
And I’d been fleeced to “ poddy” him.
I speak the truth, as sure as sin,
He laid me out, then ran me in.
He tried the case—said “ Fourteen Da} r s ! ”
And—ere we went our different ways—
“ Now, silence in the court!” said lie,
“ Support the local Factor-ee ! ”
He was a man of high renown,
That boss Jay Pea of Cowville Town.

CONSTIPATION.
Constipation is like stuffing up the sewers of
the city, and keeping all the filth in them till they
are filled with poison and corruption, breeding
disease and pestilence. When the bowels are
clogged the waste matter decays and ferments,
and enters the blood, and is carried to all parts of
the body, producing headaches, biliousness, sleep-
lessness, heartburn, loss of appetite, indigestion,
neuralgia, rheumatism, and various other ailments,
disturbing the heart and nervous system, and, if
continued, is liable to cause inflammation of the
bowels, liver, and kidneys. To maintain a
healthy system the bowels should operate at least
once every 24 hours. This is one of Nature’s pro-
visions which is too often ignored, and the result
is untold suffering. Women are the greatest
offenders, but sooner or later they must pay the
penalty. Many women’s ailments are due to the
straining and purging, following upon habitual
constipation, and in many cases displacement of
the pelvic organs may be attributed to the same
cause. Constipation caused through neglect in
course of time becomes chronic, and the use of
drastic purgatives not only weakens the intestines,
but by the habitual use of such medicine the
bowels refuse to act naturally. Dr. Morse’s
Indian Root Pills are a perfect remedy. They
act upon the liver, and stimulate the secretion of
bile, and assist the liowels in a perfectly natural
manner to throw off the waste matter from the
system. They do not weaken, sicken, or gripe,
nor parch the bowels—like salts (which thin the
blood) and many other remedies which only
aggravate the trouble—but restore them to their
normal condition, and, being purely vegetable,
may be taken with perfect safety by the most
delicate woman or the youngest child.

NOTIONS
V.R.C. Autumn fragments: Scobie’s Victorian
and Payten’s N.S.W. stables won five and four races re-
spectively. The V.R.O. books show a loss of £lOOO,
which is much in excess of the anticipated deficit. Pos-
sible result is that future Autumn meetings will be
limited to three days. N.S.W. jockey Hickey won riding
honors, on six winners. Bolton, of the same State, had
three successes. After him came Bobby Lewis, of Mel-
bourne, who scored twice. Mountain King was, un-
questionably, the best nag engaged, although Peru,
Sivori, and Alawa won twice. Jumpers, excepting Came-
lot, who,spread-eagled his field, were a mighty poor lot.
Winning sires were Grafton and Wallace, four of G.’s
progeny winning six races, and four of Wallace’s gather-
ing in five events.
* * * *
The main features of the meeting were the suc-
cesses of Wallace and Grafton as sires, and of Scobie and
Payten as trainers, and the dislike of the public incurred
by Glarke brothers (most unjustly) and J. McDonald.
When Jack Smith (Wallace —Glint), so called after the
name of theownerof Wallace, won the Autunjn Handicap in
record time there was a demonstration against the owners
(the Clarke brothers). Nothing could have been more
unreasonable. It is true Jack Smith lost the Sunbury Cup
and won the Bond Cup from end to end with W. H. Smith
up. Then he ran nowhere in the Brunswick Stakes and
Australian Cup, and came out and won the Autumn
Handicap with C. Bolton up—won it likewise from end to
end. But horses have tempers, and Jack Smith has a bad
one.
• • * *
Since Carlyon in 1888 only four 3-year-olds
have won the Australian Cup, and Peru was the fourth.
With Tartan out of the way, the field (15) represented
quantity rather than quality. Apologue started first
favorite at 7 to 2, and finished fast and fifth. Bar
Apologue and the winner (9 to 2), 12 to 1 was on offer on
the field. The time (4min. OJsec.) was within 3Jsec. of
the record for the race, put up by Lord Ullin’s Daughter
in 1905. Peru is one of the few Graftons who have shown
themselves partial to a distance, a quality he further empha-
sised by winning the Champion Stakes on Saturday. He
is a black colt from Silver Corn, and is owned by Agar
Wynne, of Victoria, and trained by Tom Payten, of N. S.
Wales. This dual management is probably due to the
fact that Agar Wynne, a member of the Australian Par-
liament, is anxious to avoid inter-State jealousies.
In the Ascot Vale Stakes (6 furlongs) The
Brewer (from Idalia) won easily in lmin. 16sec. Mother
Goose was absent, and J. Barden replaced W. H. Smith in
the saddle. The Brewer is certainly the champion
two-year-old, despite the fact that he was beaten by a
head by Mother Goose on the previous Saturday
(due to faulty riding), and was ui.able to give away
28t. less lib. to Alawa, who, according to human ideas of
breeding, would be either his step, or illegitimate,
brother, being by the same sire, but from a different lady
(Crossfire). The Brewer was bought before the autumn
campaign at Caulfield by Mr. Bunbury, of W.A., for
1500 guineas. He should, and probably will, be the
favorite for next year’s Derby.
“ Unto him that hath shall be given.” Luck still
pursues Mr. J. E. Stanley, his Oakleigh Plate winner,
Bright Steel, getting home by a hgad in the Bourke
Handicap (7fur.) in lmin. 27Jsec., at the nice price of
12 to 1. Members of the “ fly” division (i.e., those who
don’t allow the flies to settle on their dead birds) might
keep their eyes on this son of St. Simon and Glare for the
Doncaster Handicap.
In the All-Aged Stakes (1 mile) Antonio, the
alleged cripple, threw out a defi. to Mountain King, but
the latter’s canny owner scratched. He wants his horse
to be ttie champion of the year, but he does not want
him to be taken out of his cotton wool wrapping one scrap
more often than is absolutely necessary to maintain his
reputation. It may have been good business—it certainly
was not good sport. But then racing is not always sport.
Anyhow, the race is not always to the swift, nor the
battle to the “ strong.” This horse’s defection in the mile
(in order to keep him fresh for the Loch Place—2 miles)
was as “ strong” as a managing clerk’s affidavit, but the
owners of Apologue and Peru, the only other con-
testants in the Loch Plate, put their heads together and
scratched their horses, so Mr. McDonald, the owner of
Mountain King, got a walk-over but only half the stake.
Camelofc (Tradition-Circlet) won the Autumn
Steeplechase, about three miles, in 6min. 32£sec., fencing in
faultless style. This is the time when the usual shriek
arises about a dearth of jumpers for the G.N. season, but
they arrive all the same, as regularly as babies in a par-
son’s family.
On the final day (will there ever be a final day ?)
at Flemington, Alawa took the Select Stakes, a seven-
furlong handicap for 2-year-olds, in lmin. 30isec\, wherein
the crack Brewer did not even get a place. For the same
race there were entered six horses by the Same sire, and
the official book gives the spelling Malster (twice) and
Maltster (four times). Of course, “Maltster” was in-
tended by the christener (the dam being Barley), but this
scribe is prepared to bet his immortal soul that the name
given in nomination was Malster, if anyone thinks he has
an immortal soul of less value and that he is getting the
best of the odds. Many wagers were made and lost over
the true pronunciation of Decollette, which was meant for
Decollete.
“0.K.”: Peru, the three-year-old that won
the Australian Cup, only cost owner Agar Wynne
280g5., as a yearling. His prospects were not
charming when he left Sydney for Melbourne, just
before the meeting, as he was sore and short
of polish. But he came on amazingly. The field of
15 was equal to that of 12 months ago, but was four short
of the record line-up in Malua’s year, 1886. The scratch-
ing of Tartan, so crippled that he may never race again,
was a gold mine to the O’Moses family, as the money was
piled on him at absurdly short odds. Tartan, it will be
remembered, won the Australian Cup two years ago.
The tale of Rand wick trainer Ike Earnshaw
during the past year and a half: Two Derbies, two St.
Legers, two Melbourne Cups, two Caulfield Cups, a Car-
rington and a Futurity Stakes, and a number of smaller,
but more or less substantial events which all helped to
fill up. His success with Antonio, given away in England
as a wreck, for 300 guineas, has been astounding.
The possibility of unregistered pony meetings
completely overshadowing those of the nobler and regis-
tered horse in Sydney, is growing every day. Ponydom
provides larger fields, more races, and a bigger percentage
of triers. Also the handicapping of the ponies is better,
and the pony Patrick Moses is a more liberal layer of odds
than the other Moss who howls on the horse course. On
Saturday last Kensington’s pony meeting was up against
Canterbury Park’s horse gathering, and drew a bigger
crowd, and the crowd got much more fun for its cash
than the one that gathered at Canterbury Park (the
course Joey Carruthers used to be interested in).

N.S.W. had the lion’s share of the prize money
in No. 1 Sweep on the Newmarket, Mr. McKillop, of South
Head, Sydney, winning £6OOO, and Mr. Millar, of Narro-
mine, £3OOO ; at least those were the announced totals.
It is not said what “ cut,” if any, -horseowners had out of
the prizes. The third prize went to Dr. James, of
Wellington, Maoriland.
* » * *
When Tresidder went across to Maoriland to
win back the sculling glory, this paper expressed the
belief that he hadn’t a possible. Apparently the same
idea had a good grip of the mind of Fogwell, who trained
him, for, having a little money to gamble with, he put it
all on Webb, and came back with his pockets bulging
with Australian gold.
W. F. TREMBATH, of Gore, Maoriland's
representative in the Australasian champion-
ship middle distance events.
Proposed by a number of Sydney gentlemen
to found an association or club in connection with the
sport of rod-fishing, and a preliminary meeting is being
held this (Thursday) night, in connection with the busi-
ness, at the Customs House Hotel. The new body doesn’t
propose to trespass on the allotments of the Rod Fishers’
Society or the A.F.A., and it is hoped that members of
the two older bodies will also join the third. It seems
like superfluity. The idea is to form a club devoted to
all branches of casting, and this body will meet fort-
nightly or monthly, whack fish yarns, and arrange
contests in fly, bait and surf casting. Also, it will
arrange competitions in both salt and fresh water, and
the casting education of members who are deficient and
backward will be helped on by the advice and tuition of
experts.
Sterns that the real cause of the late departure
of the N.S.W. athletic team to Hobart was lack of funds,
and not parsimony. It is a fearful thing to be hard up,
as writer knows from experience. Athletics draw no
crowds in N.S.W., except when admission is free, and
then some hundreds of people will condescend to look on
and applaud occasionally. Considering that its annual
revenue is under £4O, the council deserves credit for
having raked in sufficient shekels to send the team away
to battle for the Ma State at all. Whether the council is
wise to trouble about the Ma State’s reputation under
these conditions is another matter. If it published a
statement that, owing to the ghastly meanness of the
public, the State would not be represented at the next
Australasian Championships meeting, it might do a lot of
good to the funds and put things on abetter footing. As
it is the whole expense is borne by a few enthusiasts who
are not really in a position to afford it, and the other sort
swagger round and talk about the records “ we ” broke.

They support their amateur sportsmen better
in Queensland than they do in N.S.W., and Springfield,
the Bananaland champion swimmer, left Westralia in the
Grosser Kurfurst for London, where he will represent the
northern State in the Olympic Games. Although he had
no luck in Westralia, both friends and rivals are loud in
their praises of his pluck. With a decent spell in which
to get fit, he may have better fortune in Britain, although
the quality of the opposition will be all-round much
higher. It is a pity that Beaurepaire cannot get away
immediately—with a proper chance to get right that
stripling would astonish the natives of Bull Land.
* * • *
Beaurepaire’s marvellous sprinting powers came
as a revelation to the competitors and public generally.
Cecil Healy, talking about the Westralian tour, tells how,
going across, they never gave Beaurepaire a thought,
but after they had seen him practising, they suddenly
realised there was an Achilles on the premises. Healy’s
opinion, which may or may not be somewhat exaggerated
by the fact that Beaurepaire beat him so badly, opines
that Beaurepaire will turn out to be the finest swimmer
now in the world, and will even excel the records of the
mighty Kieran.
* * * *
Lily Beaurepaire followed up her success in the
100yds. Ladies’ Championship of the Cabbage State by
annexing a similar distance—All Girls’ Championship—
at the combined State schools’ meeting at South Mel-
bourne baths last Friday. Lily covered the prescribed
journey in lmin. 28 l-ssec., though she is capable of doing
the hundred in less. However, her 70sec. for the Yic.
Championship was a misfortune, attributed to incom-
petent clocking.

Melbourne pennant cricket last Saturday was
mostly a picnic for the bowlers, no achievements with the
bat being particularly startling. Certainly Bailey
knocked up 74 for North against Northcote ; while Steel
made 60 for Essendon against Carlton. But those were
all, practically. The most interesting discussion was that
between Fitzroy and East, at the latter’s ground, where
’Roy (minus Frank Tarrant, now on his way back to Eng.
land) could only manage a total of 171. Bowlers Goss (4
for 63) and Parsons (5 for 42), both late of Richmond, were
answerable for ’Roy’s demolition. University’s 256 for six
wickets against South was the most respectable total for
the day. Next to that came Northcote's 211 against
North Melbourne, the North trundler, W. Carlton,
gathering in no less than seven victims for 75 runs.
Other good bowling performances were those of Knell
(live for 40) for Collingwood against P’ran; while,
against Essendon, Australian bowler Saunders took four
for 40 for his club, Carlton. In the wicket-keeping
department, an eminently useful citizen is Hastings of
the same club, who hurried on the funerals of four bats-
men.
• * • *
Another round of the First Grade Cricket Com-
petition started in Sydney on Saturday, and afforded some
interesting developments. Waverley, meeting Gordon on
the home green, won the toss, and Macartney fell upon it,
taking nine wickets for 38 runs. It looked like a rout,
and the innings closed for 125. But Rose, of Waverley,
was also on the job, and knocked down six Gordon
wickets for a miserable 24. Hill got two more for
12, and when the day ended Gordon had lost
nine wickets for 60 runs. Balmain made a magni-
ficent start against Petersham, Blaxland making
130 off his own bat ; and then a rot set in, and
the wickets began to go like leaves in a bush fire. Of the
last six men only one reached double figures, and the
innings ended for 262, of which Blaxland had
University had a bad time at the leather of Redfern, Words-
worth taking eight wickets for 70. The innings brought
only 193, while at the drawing of stumps Redfern had
made 31 for the loss of the first wicket. Middle Harbor
also struck trouble in McCloy, of Paddington, who
banged down five wickets for 62, while Noble took two
for 13, and the Middle Harbor effort ended for 103.
Paddington started badly, Trumper’s champagne being
again off, and leaving him with only four to his
credit. But, as usual, Noble came to the rescue
and smote for 42. When he carried his bat
at close of day seven wickets were down for 106, three
more than Middle’s total score. Randall, of “ Middle-
arb,” had taken three for 44, and Row two for 16. Glebe
played a solid game against Central Cumberland, notch-
ing 355 for a loss of eight wickets. At the Cricket Ground
Sydney got four Burwood wickets cheaply enough, and
then Gregg and Emery got set, and made 127 between
them, of a total score of 234. Sydney made a start, and
had made 14 without losing a wicket when time ran out.
The only century-maker of the day was Blax-
land, of Balmain, with his 130. Taylor, of Glebe, got close
with 91. The 69 of Gregg, of Burwood, was the third best.

Oxford University missed a big thing when
Victoria passed over young Hazlitt for the only other
applicant as this year’s Rhodes scholar. To have a Test-
match cricketer thrown at them ready-made would have
suited the Dark Blues, who have lost their last three
matches with Cambridge (R. A. Young, of the present
English team, was in the winning XI. on each occasion).
The Rhodes scholarships are supplying Oxford with
many useful athletes. Maoriland, S’Africa and Canada
all send Rugby footballers; the United States, track-
runners ; Canada and Australia, lacrosse experts. Roy
Robinson, of Adelaide, is cabled as having won the
weight-putting contest against Cambridge for the second
year in succession. The ’Varsity on the Cam is said to
have confident hopes of a reaction among British parents,
who will realise that to send their sons to Oxford is not to
give them a fair chance of getting either a “blue” or
scholarship honors in competition with the keen rivals
from the ends of the earth.
* * * •
S.A.’s return match with the English cricketers
was cut down to three days by the absolute British re-
fusal to play on the Saturday, after two nights in the
train. S.A. cricket rather fancies itself just now, and is
mad at having been denied the usual home matches with
N.S.VV. and Victoria. It worried Jones and Co. out
somehow for 404 (Gunn 102, Rhodes, not out, 78). Wright
was left out for Hewer, a local bowler of somewhat simi-
lar action, and he justified himself by taking five for 149.
Then, with Barnes and Fielder not playing, S.A.’s fine
string of vigorous young batsmen made hay of the other
bowling. They scored much faster than their opponents
had done. Dolling (140) and Mayne (74) led the way in
a total of 445. Hutchings and Hobbs had time to make
yet further failures before the match fizzled out. Clem
Hill was apparently the only man on either side who
didn’t take the game in dead earnest. He hit at every-
thing, and was missed three times in making 33. At the
finish he went on to bowl, and got Hobbs' wicket.
Adelaide reckons Dolling about its biggest discovery since
Hill left school, 14 years ago. This was his first game
against English bowling.
• * *
Heaven only knows what is the fascination
about club swinging for 2£ days, but apparently there is
hidden joy in the timber waving business. Broken Hill
went delirious on Saturday night when Tom Burrows,
who apparently makes some sort of a living at this dreary
game, twirled his clubs for 61hr. 40min., breaking his
previous record by one whole minute. Apparently he
could nave gone on indefinitely, as he is reported to have
finished fit and well, joining in the popular songs the
audience howled to keep him awake. It is also said- that
the disease is catching on, and that club swingers are
cropping up all over Australia and in S’Africa, where
Burrows’ championship is understood to be in consider-
able danger.
* * * *
Saturday last was general championship day in
Sydney. Yachts, open boats, and swimmers were all
busy deciding various championships, and up in Brisbane
there were also swimming championships for ladies, on
toast. Awanui won the 10-metre championship, and
Culwulla that of the eight-metre yachts. Oweenee won
the championship of the Sydney Amateur Club, which
carries with it, as outward and tangible sign, the Kelly
Cup, the coveted bauble of the amateur open-boat sailers.
At the Fort-street swimming carnival, A. Wickham w-on
the State diving championship. And at Brisbane, N.S.W.
girl Mina Wylie won the 60 yards’ Australian (ladies’)
swimming championship. In addition to which the
champions from Westralia came home to mother and
beauty.

"Posh”: It seems that the smallness of the
surf mortality among fools on the Sydney beaches is not
due to the fools having absorbed common sense, but to
the splendid efforts of the life-saving club men. On a
recent Sunday there were no less than 37 rescues on
Bondi beach, one man alone saving 12 idiots, who, judg-
ing by their lack of plain brains, might as well have been
left to drown. Then that rescuer, dog-tired, put on his
clothes, remarking that the next flat that got into trouble
might perish so far as he was concerned. Just then a
wild halloo told that another flat was in difficulties, and
that half-dressed rescuer peeled off and went out once
more, and rendered valuable assistance. Then he got away
quickly. On Sunday last on one beach there were no less
than a baker’s dozen of close calls. The surf life-saver is
the most altruistic person writer knows of. Rescuers are so
common that they don’t even get their names in the
papers, and sometimes they get assaulted by excited fools
on the shore while trying to keep the life-lines clear.

Considering the sort of deaths he is called upon
to face, the cyclist should ride in plate armor and beaked
helmet, like the knights of the Norman period. Here are
some of the ways cyclists have passed out during the last
few years. At Stortford (England), the top bar broke
letting the rider down into the frame as he was running
down hill. The jagged points of the fractured tube tore
out his stomach when the smash came. Armor would
have saved him. In Maoriland, another, whose brake gave
way on a steep incline, was hurled over a precipice and
impaled on the spiky branches of a dead tree. Doubtful
if armor would have saved him. An unusually bad case
was that of the man who, riding across the Canterbury
Plains at night, on a disused track, broke his neck bv
striking a rail put across at a boundary fence to keen
cattle from straying. In Victoria, last Sunday, one man
had his skull smashed by a passing cab, and another
unfortunate youth was impaled on the shaft of a vehicle.
He remained conscious with the shaft through the lower
part of his body while a doctor sawed it off as close to the
body as practicable and took him to the hospital. To save
him'was impossible, and he endured his agony with grim
fortitude till death brought relief.
* * * *
Last Saturday’s attraction at Melbourne’s
Saucer Track was a six hours’ race between teams of
two—one man of each team to be on the track at a time
which meant three.hours’ riding per man. Though the
“ race ” started at 3 p.m., nobody took much interest in
the matter till about 8.30, by which time some 123 miles
had been covered. That record, of course, indicated that
no team had attempted to steal a march on the others.
No one was even a lap ahead. The men just meandered
gradually round, amicably taking turns at “ pacing.” \t
8.59 a bell announced that four more laps would see the
finish, so the six-hour contest merely became a matter
of a final sprint. The great MacFarland, who had en.
joyed a half-hour’s spell while Clark ran for the Clark.
MacFarland partnership, had steadily kept himself behind
the pacemaker, ignoring the crowd’s urgent prayer to “ get
a move on.” He let himself out directly the bell rang
but found that P. Hehir, A. J. Davies and George Horder
all had a trifle more in reserve than he, and the great man
had to be satisfied with fourth money (£6), half of which
wenttoClark. Prizes wereratherliberal; £3owenttoHehir
and his mate, S. E. Gordon ; £l5 to Davies and Quinlan,
and £lO to Holder and Gascoyne. Horder’s performance
was far the most meritorious of the lot, for Gascoyne
fell and broke his collarbone early in the proceed,
ings, and “George” had to put in about five
hours’ riding and a fast finish all on his own.
The distance for the six hours was 136 i miles!
A third-class 6-furlong race went to H. Okey, and Cecil
de Fraga whirled his motor-bike over two and three
miles considerably faster than W. Gerbes. No informs-
tion was given as to the make or the horse-power of either
machine. De Fraga’s pace was considerable—two miles
in 2min. 56£sec.— but nothing scaresome. Then the
band played the “ Dead March ” or “ Annie Rooney,” or
something, and the crowd lagged home.

Lovely woman is rushing madly into the
athletic arena at more than two miles an hour. Follow,
ing on Mrs. Isa Bell’s challenge for female sprinting
honors is another by Mrs. Myra Palmer, of Birming-
ham—Joe Chamberlain’s Birmingham—for the skirted
cycling supremacy of the Commonwealth. Her invita-
tion has been accepted by Mrs. A. E. Hocking, and the
dames will settle the argument on Richmond (Vic.) City
Reserve, on March 25, for £25 a side and half the “gate."
Distances—one, three, and five miles ; two out of three
to win ; ladies to be paced by motor-cycles. This paper
hasn’t hitherto heard of Mrs. Palmer, but Mrs. Hocking
was a good road-rider some 10 years ago, before she
married cyclist and cycle-builder Hocking, of Colling,
wood.
* * * *
After all, W. F. Trembath, the Maorilander,
didn’t put up a truly wonderful performance by defeat-
ing Nigel Barker in the half-mile Australasian Champion-
ship at Hobart. The clock said 2min. 0 l-ssec., which
isn’t remarkable time. On the same track Murray won
the quarter-hurdles from Les. Davies in 58 2-ssec. Trem-
bath’s performance alongside the incomparable George
Wheatley’s previous Australasian time(lmin. 57sec.) looks
second-rate, besides which George has been clocked
to do lmin. 55sec. for the half, and his
4min. 23sec. mile is another commendable achieve-
ment. Confidence cannot be placed in the mighty
Nigel while he endeavors to win half-mile events with a
finishing sprint. If he decides to mend his ways and run
from the gun to the tape, he stands a chance of success;
but up against a middle-distance ped of high calibre,
who’ll make him run all the way, Nigel’saspirationsfor Aus-
tralasian honors are dicky—very dicky. Meanwhile, Hector
Burk, of the Dominion, is after half-railer Trembath, of
Gore.

The attraction at the Masonic Hall (Melb.) on
Friday, 20th inst., in connection with the boodle-raising
on behalf of Olympians Blake and Aitken—who are to
compete in the Windsor-to-London 26-mile pad, provided
the needful is raised —will take the form of biff between
lightweights Ralph and Hobbs, and bantams Gray and
Ansell. Both engagements are billed for five rounds,
and, besides athletic items, Chief-Justice John Madden
will orate on Marathon and other athleticisms.
This alone will be well worth the requested admission
money. On Saturday, by way of diversion, Blake will
toddle forth for a twenty-miler somewhere out near the
Dandenong Ranges.

The Rugby League, the new body, is making a
lot of headway in Sydney, and has raked in quite a
respectable army of players already. Where they will
play is a question that puzzles most people, and is a sub-
ject on which the League has maintained a deep silence.
It is the lack of grounds that is keeping back the Austra-
lian game, and its votaries play for honor only. Unless
the League can get grounds with good accommodation
(and grounds for which it can charge admission), the
League is busted, overthrown and subverted.
* * * *
The Lang-Smith disturbance for the Aus-
tralian heavy-weight championship was painfully brief.
Smith stepped into the ring, and then, as another
defeated champion remarked, Lang hit him with his
hand. He hit him on the body, then he hit him on the
jaw, dropping him on one knee. When Smith got up he
smote him over the jaw again, and across the back of the
neck, or somewhere in that quarter, knocking him
over the ropes, so that his gizzard rested on the
top one. There was no fight. It was just a slug-
ging exhibition, which Smith failed to endure for quite
one round. The Lord forgive those who induced the un-
lucky wretch to get into the ring-with Lang ! All the
same, just in case Lang should get excited over it, it must
be remembered that he himself is not a Jack Johnson,
but a mere mediocrity holding a champion’s position be-
cause his general environment is of darned low bruising
capacity.
THE BISHOP’S REMEDY.
[FOR THE BULLHTIN.]
London, March 4.—The Right Rev. Dr. Winnington-
Ingram, Bishop of London, has returned from a visit to
St. Petersburg, Moscow, and Warsaw. He declares that
the cause of the great unrest among, and the revolutionary
tendencies-of, young men and girls is that Russia is with-
out public school games. An effort is now being made to
introduce British sports.— Daily Paper.
Oh 1 when a bishop stoops to think and point out sin and
vanity,
o lay his frills and gaiters by and benefit humanity,
We marvel at his clever brain, its quickness and its clarity,
And note the splendid store he has of Faith and Hope and
Charity.
What is this wretched Liberty these Russian fools are
whining for ?
I swear upon my gaiters, sir, it’s cricket they are pining
fort
When they play bowls the shadow of Siberia won’t harass
them,
And executions won’t annoy or massacres embarrass them.
Football will counteract the knout, and Cossacks wild and
numerous
When charging mobs and riding down will strike them as
just humorous,
True sports do not object to being ruled by a minority,
This fact you have on good ecclesiastical authority !

The S. M. Heeald printed some figures, the
other day, to show how unreasonable coal-miners
ran be when they try. A couple of these fellows
had worked oniy 13 days out of 20, yet had
averaged 12s. a day for the whole time. Other
cases were cited by the horrified Heeald where
men had only worked 11 days out of 20. All this
sounds very shocking until you turn up the
report of the N.S.W. Miners’ Accident Relief
Fund, just presented to the Minister for Mines,
and see that last year there were 48 fatal mining
accidents and 5960 mining accidents that weie not
fatal, and, further, that of these latter 3768 hap-
pened in the coal-mines. For every 1000 coal-
mine employees there were last year 252 accidents ;
so there was one accident for every four men, with
a few accidents over. In the Western and
Southern districts the men don’t so often come
home in the ambulance or on a shutter ; so the
proportion in the North, which the Hkeald was
talking about, is a good deal more than one acci-
dent to every four men. There are people
(including the horrified Heeald apparently) who
assume that, when a coal-miner only works 13
days out of 20, he spends the odd seven in getting
drunk, or in bloated idleness. The foregoing
figures show that he is liable to spend a good
many of those days nursing a broken arm or a
crushed head. And, as he doesn’t “go on the
fund” for small injuries, which lay him up for
only a day or two —he must get a doctor’s certifi-
cate before he can draw a penny—even the fore-
going figures don’t give anything like a complete
idea of the number of accidents. What, honestly,
would the Heeald charge to take on a job in
which, on averages, it would be bound to get
smashed up—probably killed and certainly tem-
porarily disabled—inside four years ?
-♦
Accoeding to Postmaster-General Maugee :
On alcohol Australians spend more per head than they
do on railway travelling, churches, charities, education,
amusement, art, postage and telegrams, and books and
newspapers together !
Which is a very sensational statement put that
way. On the other side, Maugee should remem-
ber that a whole lot of the money nominally spent
on alcohol is really spent on taxation, and
is the contribution of the drinker to the
revenue of the Commonwealth. In 1907, stimu-
lants paid in Customs taxation £2,223,430,
and in Excise £798,768. That £3,000,000
can fairly come off the drink bill; it represents
money that is really spent, not on beer, but on
defence and education and cheap postage and
railway travelling. There is, of course, a case for
temperance, but it isn’t the intemperate kind of
case that-'Maugee puts forward.

The Stinking Fish party is having a beautiful
time just at present. The great, ungainly Asturias
steamed into Australian ports the other day, and
straight way there began a vast amount of news-
paper and other puffing—with an object. The
vast floating pub belongs to the Royal Mail
Steam Packet Co., which two years ago
nought the Pacific Co.’s interest in the Orient
Co.’s contract with Australia ; but under
the new contract the Orient will have all
the work to do, the Orient Co. being the only one
willing to accept Australia’s white-labor terms.
So it looks as though the Asturias were sent
along just for once—it is admitted that the
mass will only corne once —as a parting
shot, to show’ Australia what it is missing ; and
the Stinking Fish crowd has been busy pointing
the immoral—which is to the effect that the Very
-Naicest (about ’O5 per cent, of the Australian
Population) could travel “abroad’’ in much more
Magnificence if only the other 99 95 per cent, of
the population would subsidise black and brown
labor, instead of encouraging the white boy of the
Bulldog Breed. What the Stinking Fish party
carefully doesn’t mention is that, though sundry
companies were subsidised without labor restric-
tionsoff and on for 50years past, they neversentany
Asturias out this way before—and they probably
wouldn’t do it again, restrictions or no restrictions.
Mr. Bishop Lyne, brother of the Federal
Treasurer, William John Lyne, died last week, of
paralysis. He was born in Tasmania in May,
1848, married Miss Emma Bennett, and had a
family of two sons and four daughters. The
Ly-ries originally came from Gloucestershire, Eng-
land. Grandfather William Lyne. of Apsley
House, Glamorgan, Van Diemen’s Land, arrived
j n 1826, when 42 years of age, and founded the
family hereabouts. He married Sarah Bishop, of
London, and died in 1854.

1C ? • ne aldei, of the squattei-
village of Camperdown (V ic.), has been arranging
a cricket-match between his townsmen and the
touring South Sea Islanders. In the course of
negotiations he visited the chief nigger at his
hotel in Launceston, and came away loaded to
bursting-point with humble admiration. He
spread some of it on paper, and despatched the
screed with a rush to the Camperdown
Chronicle ; and, on February 29, the readers of
that rag gaped in awesome astonishment at
Calder s rapturous message. I hey had thought
a mere cricket-match was in store for them, but
<> it was more like a visit from the gods,
Calder s ecstasies over the beautiful bronze legs,
the bounding agility, the scant and savage clobber
?“<* the pretty manners of the mgs. were fine and
large ; hut what made his admiring soul tairlv
rise and slop over was their kowtow. On one
occasion, says Calder-
R a tu Kadavu called for a pen to sign an autograph
album. The Fijian approached to within two paces and
] ine i tj an( i j n this posture handed the pen to his chief.
In these little acts of homage and respect, even the Aus-
tralian native might do well to imitate.
Calder’s gainmar is pretty horrible, but his grovel
is all right. Next time Mr. Manifold or Mr.
Chirnside asks the humble Calder for a match, no
doubt he will hand it over with his nose on the
floor and his coat-tail in the air, and Heaven
grant I may be there to see ! After that, thy ser-
vant will be content to depart in peace.
g mem bers of the Methodist Confer-
frolic on a Saturday night They endeavored to
distract
f he m J e sinfll] bloke, and, thus heavily disguised,
they toured round the hotel bars to learn how
Adelaide gets drunk, the average age of its tank,
and whether its barmaids are a lure to destruc-
tion. They were accompanied on this dangerous
mission by two policemen ; but, judging by the
report, they were sadly disappointed at the harm-
lessness of Adelaide when seeking beer. One
parson who is prominent in anti-beer and anti-bar-
maidism said, in regretful tones, that he saw no
bar-damsel whom he yearned to embrace. These
self-appointed vigilants didn’t pay their way, hut
went into the bars, gazed round, and flea
quite dry, amidst the jeers of the wet, sinful
populace. Now the beer-drinkers are thinking of
organising a similar examination of the churches,
They propose to march up and down the aisle
with notebooks in hand, count the number of
men, take stock of the feminine hardness of coun-
tenance, consider whether there is anything in the
choir that they might be inclined to cuddle, and
depart without dropping the customary thrup-
pence in the plate.

HOW TO MAKE YOUR LIVER AND KIDNEYS ACT
Uric Acid Brings 111-Health.
Investigation strengthens the belief that eating too
much meat is responsible for the formation of uric acid,
which produces disease in our midst with terrible results.
It is quite true that a large percentage of the popu-
lation suffer from uric acid troubles. But eating meat is
a necessity of life, and one of its greatest pleasures.
The round of roast beef, with the rich, red gravy, is
a palate tickler we should not like to discard. If we are
to give up eating meat, and many other pleasures of life,
we might as well die.
There is no need to die (at least, not at present),
and there is no reason why any of the reasonable
enjoyments of life should be abandoned if we regulate
the internal organs to counteract the mischief of errors
in diet.
Kutnow’s Powder taken occasionally before break-
fast, on an empty stomach, will clear the system of all
excessive uric acid. It has a most delightfully refreshing
and invigorating effect.
It clears and cleanses the foul stomach and quickly
gets rid of indigestion. It rouses the piggish liver
flushes the kidneys, washes out the bladder, and m
effectually removes biliousness and jaundice.
The best health-giver in the world is Kutnow s
>owder, which only needs to be tried in order to prove
ts own merits. Once you purchase a bottle you will
lever regret it.

Kutnow's Brings Good Health,
Is it your wish to eat well, digest well, sleep well,

Wisdom answers, YES !! ! We are glad to hear it.
Send to the nearest chemist for a bottle of Kutnow’s
Powder and you will enjoy good health hereafter.

Suffered Three Months —Sister
Afflicted, Too —Both Were
COMPLETELY CURED BY
CUTICURA REMEDIES
“My little boy was affected with
eczema about the head and face. He
had it from birth, but it broke out
badly when he was about three months
old, and then we couldn’t get any rest
with him night or day. It went on
Jike that till he was six months old,
and then I made up my mind to try
Cuticura Remedies and see if it would
etop the itching. The first time I used
the Cuticura Soap, Cuticura Ointment,
and Cuticura Resolvent, he got relief
and got a nice sleep. I went on with it
till it was cleared off the head. I had
to cut all his curls off to get at it to
cleanse it. His head and face were all
a raw mass. He used to scratch and
make it bleed dreadfully, till I tied
Eieces of cotton on his hands to prevent
im hurting h.mself. When I took my
little girl to tn? doctor for the same
trouble, he couldn’t do her any good,
so I didn’t take the boy, but the girl
hasn’t a blemish how as I used the
Cuticura Remedies for her, and she is
now on her fourth year and the boy
xs on his third year. Now he has a
lovely head of curls and the girl too.

BODY BECAME SO DENUDED OF FLESH
THAT CLOTHES HUNG LIKE A SACK.
Clements Tonic
“LIFTED ME FROM THAT SORRY STATE.”
Mr. V. BORWICK, Storekeeper, of 28G and 288 Crown Road,
Ultimo, relates his COMPLETE CURE to a Sydney reporter.
“ It is six years ago now since I got all right
again,” Mr. Berwick remarked, and I think it
was about up to me to have a change of luck, con-
sidering that I had been suffering for fully three
years. The pains that ran along my gums and
reached up to the top of my head were something
terrible, and half my time I did not know what I
was doing. My adversities set'in when I was
‘‘ running the plank,” as they call it, on a boat
discharging blue metal, and I can assure you that
I was so broken down in health that I had to put-
another man on to do my work about every other
week. Talk about neuralgia. lam sure nobody
could have it worse than I had, and as I found
such a grand cure for it, the least I can do is to let
humanity know all about it, for I daresay my ex-
perience will prove very helpful. Well, out of all
the medicines I tried to cure neuralgia, the only
■one that was of any lasting benefit was Clements
Tonic, and when I say that after’ keeping going
with that remedy for a few weeks the fearful
pains all left me, and have never returned all these
years, it is the honest truth I am telling you.”
‘‘ Is that the only ailment you have had ? ”
Indeed, no. All the time the neuralgia tor-
tures were at me I had other troubles to deal
with, for my digestion was just as bad as it could
be. Both from want of appetite, and also owing
to the pains about my jaws, eating was almost out
of the question ; but what was still more unfortu-
n<ite was the fact that the little I did force myself
to take to keep body and soul together had the
unhappy habit of disagreeing with me. And vou
must remember that I was getting no sleep.
JSeither night nor day—for weeks at a stretch
sometimes—could I get any rest, and, as you may
well imagine, the result was disastrous. I got so
terribly weak that ultimately I had to give up my
work altogether, and my body was so denuded of
flesh that my clothes hung about me like a sack
Indeed, I was just going to have some of them
altered about the time that I started on Clements-
ionic, and by some means or other the idea was
shelved for a while, for which I was afterwards
very glad, as in a few months I was as stout as
ever. Yes; it was quite a matter for regular
comment how well I was looking, and, thank
Cod, I felt well, too. For three years
previous to using Clements Tonic I was nothing
but a total wreck, for every part of my body
was adversely affected in some way or other. It
was my first experience of indigestion, and I sin-
cerely trust it will be my last, for I would rather
be dead and out of the world altogether than go
through such misery again. I got to feel as snaky
and uncomfortable as if everything in my
inside was going to pieces, and was so disturbed
and unsettled mentally that the least thing made
me irritable. My eyes .always felt heavy and
swollen to such an extent that i could scarcely see
to read, and I felt so discontented and restless
that I could not stay indoors. Consequently, I
often wandered about outside, hardly knowing
what to do with myself, feeling as though death
would be a thousand times more welcome than the
wretched life I was leading, for I was in agony
everywhere. The pains in my chest were really
cruel, and I thought I had strained myself or
broken something between my shoulders owing to
the pain that was there. It was like getting hold
of a piece of meat, and tearing it in two —that was
the kind of feeling I had between the shoulders,
and my loins ached badly into the bargain.”
“And have you never had a return of any of
those symptoms during the past six years?”
“No; upon my honor; and I have not had
that nasty bulged-out feeling in the stomach
either after eating my food. No, Clements Tonic
removed everything, even to the bitter taste of a
morning, and the fur that used to cover mv
tongue, besides which it gave me permanent
relief from the many attacks of giddiness that I
had previously been subjected to. How much my
nerves accounted for the misery I had endured is
hard to say definitely, but they undoubtedly had
their fair share of responsibility, for I must tell
you that I was so highly nervous that I could not
stand the least excitement without getting all of
a tremble, and I had also contracted an uncon-
trollable practice of measuring the future with
nothing but trouble and. worry in store. All I
could see before me was a continuance of my suf-
fering, only to be added to my misfortunes of
other descriptions, and now that you understand
the gloomy frame of mind I was in, you will
readily conceive why I speak so highly of Clements
lonic for lifting me from the sorry state tothe
happy and healthy condition I am now blessed
with.’

thing through the chief of staff. Once a new man was
engaged—he was a Westralian, and had never seen David
in his life. The old chief was interested in a certain
mining meeting, and' on inquiring about it the same
afternoon was told that the new man was doing it. When
the old warrior was going downstairs he encountered the
new scribe and seethed to know him by instinct.
David : You were at that meeting at Scott’s Hotel.
Scribe : 1 was.
David : Well, what was done?
Scribe : You’d better see the sub-editor.
David : But I want to know.
Scribe: Do you? Well, look here, now. Syme doesn’t
pay me to answer questions on the staircase.
David didn’t look angry. He passed on without a
word.

“ Melb.” : There is an impression that the Age will be
sold., Five in family with collateral interests. Who can
run the show on the old lines with all these influences?
I suppose the paper is worth half a million. What is the
calibre of the sons Herbert and Geoffrey ?
Tombs of great men all remind us
We may make our lives sublime.
All, departing, leave behind us
Another Age like David Syme.
It is always another Age that the David Symes of this
wbrld leave behind them. The old Age and the old man
die together. A S. M. Herald goes on for ever, for anyone
can run it without making it very different, but with a
paper like the Age, it is as it was when Tennyson died
and left the goodwill, fixtures, fittings, and utensils of his
large poem-building business to his son.

Saturday, March 5, 1803, saw the birth of Australia’s
first newspaper, the Sydney Gazette. A printing press
was sent out with the first fleet, and the British authori
ties, no doubt, thought that compositors would be-
foutid among the convicts. But that only showed their
niisjudgnient of the compositor’s character, and for a
whole decade no man could be discovered among the
criminal classes who could manage the type-setting busi
ness. Then a thin, spare individual was ferreted out,
and he set up such notices as the Governor wished to
serve on the public. During the 10 years before the thin
individual was found, all notices were hand-written and
fastened to rocks or trees, and for a while longer they
were printed and fastened to rocks or trees. In 1803,
however, the typed messages developed into the
Sydney Gazette, “George Howe, printing editor.”
It now mixed items of news with the Govern-
ment notices. Saturday was a great day for
gathering items, as people then came together for
marketing, so it was resolved to bring the Gazette out as
a Sunday paper. The editor intimated that the desire to
publish the Saturday news was the sole cause, but proba-
bly the desire to gather advertisements from the men
who came in to market was a strong incentive to the
change. The paper was only a month old when it made
the new departure. Sunday journalism in Australia thus
goes back to almost the very beginning of Australian
newspaper history. The printing shop was at first in a
room in Government House ; it next shifted to an office
in Macquarie Place, and thence passed along George-
street to a house near Essex-street, “ the enlarged busi-
ness requiring much more commodious premises.”
* * * *
J. L. Forde, who has done many 3 T ears on the Melbourne
and Sydney press, including the Age, the Australian
Star and the Sydney Telegraph, leaves for England. He
has just done 12 years’ hard graft in Tasmania, as
“Gallery” man for the Mercury, and correspondent in
the North for the same paper, and now purposes having a
look round the world. A Hobart paper, speaking of
Forde’s departure, complains bitterly that “the modern
pressman is sadly respectable, not to say plutocratic.”
Mrs. Forde accompanies her husband in his wanderings
in Mayfair and by the lucid, gradual, unobtrusive Seine.
“ Pen ” : Journalistic tribunes are not so dead as is com-
monly supposed. A little sheet has been started at Waver-
ley—the Sydney suburb with the classic cemetery and,
close at hand, Ormond House, where the Children’s Court
is held—which promises to do justice to the old press tra-
ditions. In its current issue it says Let the under-
strappers of that imitation of the Venetian Council of
Ten, which hold their secret conclaves in the dens and
dungeons of Ormond House, take note—for its walls,
solidly built as they were by old Bob Cooper, will not
screen them from the eye of’the Waverley Observer.”
It remarks in relation to the local bobbies: “It would
require a Brutus to defy temptation . . . and though some
bobbies may be brutes, none are.Brutii,” And more
closely examining the local force, it discovers parallels
with Canute, Don Juan, and Du Chaillu’s gorilla.

“ Stony ” : Who dares to say that the way of the Aus-
tralian literary genius is hard, and strewn with thorns
and boulders? At different times during my later
years, various periodicals, published by the one Melbourne
firm of religion-exploiters, have cast themselves
(postage paid) across my track. In one particular
bunch of literary thievings, I notice a tremendous advt.,
which offers a rather large sum in prizes for Australasian
stories. It is suggested that the stories may be as
humorous as the writer pleases, but must not be “ flip-
pantly irreverent ” ; they are not to be longer than 5000
words, typewritten if possible ; and the largest prize is
fifteen quid, with several prizes of five quid each. But it
is the inferior prizes which begin to attract one’s notice
properly. These prizes consist of subscriptions to
two of the periodicals issued bv the prize-offerers ; and
the face value of said prizes is £2—for 5000 words ! But
don’t pause here—go on and see what there still
remains for you if your yarn is good enough
to be printed, although not good enough to
get two quids’ worth of lifted newspaper-cut-
tings. If there should be any decent stories left after
the first afid second cash prizes have been awarded, and
after the third-prize people have had their names put on
the sub.-lists, the remainder of the stories will be paid
for at usual Tates. Now if the third prize crew collect
Bs. a thousand words, and that not in cash, what is the
“usual rate,” and would it buy a man enough beer to
drown his disappointment?

The Morning Banner’s correspondent at Wild Dog was
an energetic wretch who labored under the delusion
that the eyes of the universe were on his native town.
The illness and death of Muldoon’s best cow he considered
well worth a quarter of a column, so he wrote out a
heartbreaking account of about that length and wired it
in. The sub. in the city cut it down to this : “ Wild Dog
—Friday. Mr. Muldoon yesterday lost a valuable cow by
poisoning.” The correspondent swallowed the insuli
and kept his eye skinned for the next sensation. It
came. The Clodleapers celebrated their golden wed-
ding, and brought a camera man 70 miles to photo-
graph them sitting in the midst of their 8500
descendants. The Morning Banner man got to
work on it a week beforehand, and wrote an
uncondensed history of the whole family from the
minute the old people stepped ashore from the emigrant
ship. The next day there was a three-line notice i?i the
Banner : “ Wild Dog, Thursday—Mr. and Mrs. Cjod-
leaper celebrated their golden wedding yesterdav. They
have 850 descendants.” The infuriated correspondent
was drafting a letter to the Banner pointing out the
wrong done the Clodleapers in crediting them with only
850 descendants, instead of 8500, when a snappv letter
reached him, asking him for the Deity’s sake to be brief
and exercise a little judgment. The journalist of Wild
Dog seethed with fury, but decided to give the Banner
one more chance. It had been a particularly dry season at
Wild Dog, and for months the whole countryside had
been looking at the brassy skies and'hoping and praying
and cursing for rain. The future of the district hung on
the question of water. Couples, whispering their plans
in the moonlight, told each other they would get married
when the rain came. The Banner man's account of the
belated downpour was a great effort. It described in vivid
language the dripping hillsides and the little rills of water
laughing amongst the undergrowth. It told how the
roads changed in a few minutes from dust to mud and
how the clouds, when they had poured ’their
glorious gift all over Wild Dog, “ hung like
a great canopy above the jubilant town ” He
had it all finished long before the rain started, and when
the heavens opened and performed just as he had de
scribed, he rushed through the deluge and set the wires
humming. When the Banner came to hand next even-
ing the correspondent opened his copy with trembling
hands, and read : “ Wild Dog—Wednesday.— Three inched
of rain fell here last night.” And along with it came a
telegram giving him the sack. That was the last straw
and he wired thF Banner his candid opinion of it In
reply he got a telegram giving him the sack a-ain That
was the still more final straw. ' lna


There is already a movement a-foot in
Melbourne to erect a statue to the late Lord Lin-
lithgow, and funds are rolling in. The proposal
is to block St. Kilda-road with another banal
monument: —

Is quite a simple process. They
Just throw him in the people’s way !

FROOTOIDS
For Headache, Indigestion,
Constipation, and Biliousness.
OOO
The immense number of orders for
Frootoids, sent by post direct to the Pro-
prietor, is convincing proof that the
Public appreciate their splendid curing
power over the above-named complaints.
They are elegant in appearance, pleasant
to take, and, what is of the utmost
importance, are thoroughly reliable in
affording quick relief.
Frootoids are immensely more valu-
able than an ordinary aperient, in so far
that they not only act as an aperient,
but do remove from the blood, tissues, and
internal organs, waste poisonous matter
that is clogging them and choking the
channels that lead to and from them.
The beneficial effects of Frootoids are
evident at once by the disappearance of
headache, the head becoming clear, and
a bright, cheery sense of perfect health
taking the place of sluggish, depressed
feelings, by the liver acting properly, and
by the food being properly digested.
Frootoids are the proper aperient
medicine to take when any Congestion
or Blood Poison is present, or when Con-
gestion of the Brain or Apoplexy is pre-
sent or threatening. They have been
tested, and have been proved to afford
quick relief in such cases when other
aperients have not done any good at all.
It is of the utmost importance that this
should be borne in mind, for in such
cases to take an ordinary aperient is to
waste time and permit of a serious ill-
ness becoming fatal.
Frootoids act splendidly on the liver,
and quickly cure bilious attacks
“antibilious pills” make worse. Many
people have been made sick and ill by
“antibilious pills” who could have been
cured at once by Frootoids. People
should not allow themselves to be duped
into contracting a medicine-taking habit
by being persuaded to take daily doses
with each meal of so-called indigestion
cures that do NOT cure. Frootoids
have been subjected to extensive tests,
and have in every case proved success-
ful in completely curing the complaints
named.
The ordinary adult dose of Frootoids,
of which there are 72 in a bottle, is 2 to
4 —more or less as required—taken, pre-
ferably at bedtime, when constipated,
or at the commencement of any other
disease requiring an aperient, as av
auxiliary with the special medicine •
necessary for the case. A constipated
habit of body will be completely cured
if the patient will on each occasion,
when suffering, take a dose of Frootoids,
instead of an ordinary aperient; making
the interval between the taking of each
dose longer and the dose smaller. The
patient thus gradually becomes indepen-
dent of Aperient Medicines.

There is jubilation in Balmain just now,
for the Thode Fagelund. recently snatched by a
miracle from the Cronulla rocks, is under repair
at Mart’s Dock, and every boilermaker and iron-
worker in the suburb sees a steady three months’
job coming to him out of the £20,000 that is to be
expended. Pity it is that it wants a maritime
disaster to do all this. Half-a-dozen ships, the
construction of which was well within the capacity
of Mort’s Dock, have recently arrived to run on
the N.S.W. coast. The Moruya, Brundah, Orara,
Yulgilbar, and Kempsey can be named, costing,
say, a quarter of a million. All came in dutv-
free, while Mort’s is left to depend on the casual
wreck that is not wrecked sufficiently to go to the
bottom in order to find work for the Balmain
worker and dividends for the Sydney shareholders.
In the present case manager Franki has to make
practically a new bottom for the Thode, and make
l u UP u° t " e highest requirements of Lloyd’s. And
that he can do so there is not the remotest doubt.
The wail of the cheap human. A Grimsby
(Eng.) farm employee, charged with working a
lame horse, resentfully told the Bench: “ I
wor a good deal lamer with rheumatiz than she
wor. . Why beant there inspectors to stop ’em
workin me?” Why, indeed !

THE PILLS
have gained their wonderful reputation by sheer force
of merit, because every person who uses them
recommends them to others. They have positively
no equal for thoroughly cleansing the system and
putting the liver and kidneys in functional order,
without pain or griping. They are the best known
remedy for Indigestion, Biliousness, Headache,
Dizziness, and the common condition of ill-health
known as “run-down” or “out of sorts.” Females
of every age find Holloway's Pills an invaluable
remedy and aid.
THE OINTMENT
is known throughout the world as positively the
best and quickest remedy for Bad Legs, Old
Wounds and Sores, and Skin Eruptions of every
kind, and should be used in conjunction with the
Pills. It is also the speediest remedy for Rheu-
matism, Lumbago, Pains and Stiffness in the
Limbs and Joints, Backache, etc. For pains and
Soreness at the Chest, and for Throat and Lung
Complaints arising from Cold or Weakness,
Holloway’s Ointment affords ma«*J welcome relief
in a very short time.

BRONCHITIS
CURE
The Famous Remedy For*
COUGHS, BRONCHITIS, ASTHMA, <fc CONSUMPTION,
Has the Largest Sale of any Chest Medicine in the World.
Those who have taken this medicine are amazed at its wonderful influence. Its healing power is marvellous. Sufferers from any form of Bronchitis, Cough, Difficulty of
Breathing, Hoarseness, Pain or Soreness in the Chest, experience delightful and immediate relief; and to those who are subject to Colds on the Chest it is invaluable, as it
effects a Complete Cure. It is most comforting in allaying irritation in the throat and giving strength to the voice, and it neither allows a Cough or Asthma to become
chronic, nor Consumption to develop. Consumption has never been known to exist where “ Coughs” have been properly treated with this medicine. No house
should be without it, as, taken at the beginning, a dose is generally sufficient, and a Complete Cure is certain,.
Be'ware of Imitations l The great success of HEARNPS BRONCHITIS CURE, has induced a number
of unprincipled persons to make imitations, each calling his medicine “Bronchitis Cure,” with the object of
deceiving the simple-minded, and so getting a sale for an imitation which has none of the beneficial effects that
HEARNE’S BRONCHITIS CURE has. Consequently it has become necessary to draw your attention to this fact,
and to request you in your own interests to be particular to ask for HEARNE’S and to see that you get it.
HEARNE’S BRONCHITIS CURE, Small Size, 2/6; Large Size, 4/6. Sold by Chemists and Medicine Vendors, and by the
"Voprietor, W. G. HEARNE, Chemist, Geelong, Victoria. Forwarded to any Address;, when not obtainable locally.
NOTlCE.—Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure No. lAdoes NOT contain any poison within the meaning of the Act. It is equally beneficial for the youngest
child and the most aged person.
BENGER’S FOOD is quite
distinct from any other. It
possesses the remarkable property
of rendering milk with which it
is mixed when used, quite easy cf
digestion by Infants and Invalids.
One of the most valuable foods
known to science. It gives the
body abundance of nourishment,
with complete or partial rest to
the digestive system, regulated
as may be advisable.
Benger’s Food is sold in tins by Chemists, etc., everywhere.

Mrs. O. J. MURPHY, of Paddington, N.S.W., writes: —“Three months ago I weighed list. 41b.
After taking the first month’s course of ‘Fatcure’ I lost 161 b. The second month I lost in weight 111 b.,
and began to feel immensely better in general health. I have now, in the middle of the third month’s
course, lost another 101 b., which brings my weight down to Sst. 91b., and I have discontinued the treat-
ment.’ Xam very much pleased with the results in every way, and will always recommend ‘Fatcure.’”

As It Is In The Days of Now.
[FOR THE BULLHTIN.]
SIR WILLIAM set sail for the Holy Land,
When his good right arm wms strong —-
(Oh, never was knight with heart so right
And head so stubborn and wrong 1).
He sailed away in the birth of day
With a gay and a gallant band—
Ah, little they knew there was aught to do
In a most unholy land.
For love, or country, or faith, or gold—
Or all that men’s hearts pursue —
It was always the same in the days of old
As it is in the days that are new.
The Ladye Clare was his ladye there,
And Sir Antony Mark was his friend ;
And a clerk and a squire watched his honor for
hire,
And he trusted them all to the end.
Ilis lady gazed out from the castle gate,
And Sir William gazed back from the deck ;
And she sobbed like a bride ere she went inside,
With her arms for the other man’s neck.
’Twill be always the same in the long to come
As it was in the Long Ago—
And they ate his bread, and “ What matter,” they
said,
“ So long as he does not know.”
His father’s friend, with his grim grey beard,
And his wise old aunt, Dame Ruth,
Knew the scandal well, but they dared not tell —
Dared not tell a true man the truth.
Sir William fc come from the Holy Land,
And Sir Antony welcomes him ;
And the true friend pledges the false friend thrice,
With their glasses filled to the brim.
There’s a banquet to-night, and the ladye is
bright,
And she clings to “ her lord ” regained,
And the music is heard, and we spake no word—
But say, is his knighthood stained ?
0, I was a page to Sir William then,
And I knew the shameful thing
(To learn to do right from his noblest knight
I’d been sent by my sire, the king).
Ah, a devil was she. And they knighted me,
For I proved in the brute-fight brave,
And in council and field my lips were sealed,
And say, was I knight or knave ?
Sir William he lies in the solemn aisle,
And his ladye lies by his side —
The bravest of all, at his country’s call,
Sir Antony fo/ght and died.
And I ruled well till at last I fell
For the wife of my dearest friend ;
And he fell, too —for his wife was a shrew—
And who shall judge in the end ?
For love or honor or faith or gold—
) For good or for evil, I trow—
It was in men’s hearts in the days of old
As it is in the days of now.
N.s.w.
HENRY LAWSON.
The Backsliding of Mr.
Maunder.
[FOR THE BULLHTIN.]
AT the conclusion of a month’s enforced de-
tention Jeremiah Maunder found him-
self once more face to face with an
unsympathetic world. The gate clanged be-
hind him with a reverberating jar, and simul-
taneously an ear-splitting whistle rent the firma-
ment. A moment later his reluctant fingers were
shaken in the brotherly grip of his old partner in
iniquity, Mr. Samuel Sharp.
“ Lord love us, Jerry,” exclaimed that fraternal
individual, with enthusiasm. “If this ain’t a
sight fur sore eyes ! Why, ’ow smart we look—
air cut, shampoo, beard trimmed, wash an’ brush
up—bath too, I shouldn’t wonder. Ido ’ope
you won’t ketch the pewmonia, matey. Well,
"ell, a month’s no time, is it ? ’Ave they taught
you a trade, old pal—’ow to make shoddy trousis,
or brown paper boots ? Bli’me, I shouldn’t be
surprised if you wosn’t to open a shop in Bourke-
street nex’ ! ”
Mr. Maunder regarded his faithful comrade
with an incalculably calculating eye. There was
no hint of reciprocity in that cold, commercial
gaze ; not a suspicion of the entente cordiale which
Mr. Sharp sought to re-establish upon the crumb-
ling basis of former treaties.
“ Look ’ere, Sam Sharp,” he Said, abruptly
withdrawing his hand and lodging it, for safety’s
sake, in a side-pocket of his dilapidated jacket.
‘ *ou an’ me ain’t got nothink more ter say ter
one another. Praise be, I’ve see’d the errer of
me ways, an’ I on’y ’ope as ’ow you’ll see the errer
o your ways afore it’s too late, an’ you finds yer-
self where there’s a-gnashin’ an’ a-weepin’ an’ a-
wailin’ o’ teeth.”
Mr. Sharp blinked viciously upon his penitent
friend.
Ho, indeed,” he said, with a swift frontal
change from extreme geniality to arctic frigidity.
Ho, so that’s yer game is it, Jerry ? Con-
verted, eh ? Saveloy, I s’pose 1 You’ll look aw-
tight in a red jersey an’ a tamarine. Un’appy
example, I reckon. Well, let’s know when you’re
goin ter give some o’ yer experiences ; I should
like ter be there too. Make ’em sit up, you bet !
Brother Maunder will now tell us ’ow ’e pinched
the blind man’s larst tanner w en e wasn’t lookin’.
Glory Alleyloojah, an’ a ’ymn ter foller. I
wouldn t trust you ter do no collectin’, though, if
I wos them, Jerry—you’re so absent-minded.”
Mr. Maunder’s ingenious countenance assumed
an expression of innocence out at elbows. He
had already made considerable headway towards
sanctity under the tuition of Brother Stubbs, a
prfson missioner, professing the tenets of the
newly-established order of Primitive Apostles.
“ ’Old ’ard, Sam,” he remonstrated. “ I don’t
like ter ear you make use o’ them mockin’
I should be sorry ter think as ’ow you wos the
Father o’ Lies. Ef you on’y knew ’ow ’appy I wos
your ’eart would sing with mine fur very joy. Oh,
wot a thin' it is ter find Pease ! I ’ope your ’ard,
scoffin’ ’eart will be softened so as you’ll find
Pease too, Samuel, afore you dies an’ goes down
ter your own place in the Pit o’ ’ell-fire.”
For a brief moment Mr. Sharp tottered on the
verge of assault and battery ; he controlled him-
self, however, by a big effort, and determined to
bide his time.
“ Well, Jerry,” he said, with a masterly assump-
tion of good-natured indifference : “Pm glad
ter ’ear as ’ow you’ve found peace, though ter look
at you I’d ha’ thought you’d jest lost a shillin’ an’
picked up a bad thrip’ny bit. You see now wot a
good think it wos the old gen’leman caught you
with yer ’and in ’is pocket, else you’d still ’ave
bin a miserable sinner like me an’ the rest o’ us.
I mustn’t keep yer torkin’, I s’pose. Wot’s the
name o’ the lucky sex as ’as got the priv’lege o’
wipin’ out your ’orrible past, Jerry ?”
Mr. Maunder rushed deliberately upon his fate.
“ The Primitive ’Postles, Sam,” he rejoined, wdth
an odious excess of spiritual pride. “ Our chapel’s
the fur end of Graham-street, an’ we meets there
fur prayer an’ praise every Lord’s day, ten o’clock
an’ six, an’ Thursday evenin’s at eight.
“ Flo, you does, does you,” said Sam, with an
unholy glint in his beady eyes. “ An’ wot might
your part in the devil-dodgin’ be, Jerry, if I
might make so bold as ter arst ? ’Olding forth
with comPtable words, or sacred solus on the big
drum ! ”
The apostolic Mr. Maunder wagged his head
complacently.
“Not yet, Sam; some day, I ’ope,” he re-
marked, with a complete confidence that Mr.
Sharp found quite intolerable. “Jest at furst I’m
to stand at the door with a pile o’ red ’ymn-books
an’ say ‘ Welcome, brother,’ ter everybody as
comes in.”
“ ’Ow if it ’appens to be a woman ?”
Mr. Maunder looked doubtful.
“ I dunno,” he said, feebly.
“ I should say ‘ Welcome, little stranger,’ if I
wos you, Jerry,” suggested Mr. Sharp; “it ud
sound friendly, but not too familiar-like. It’s a
job oughter suit you down ter the ground—
nothin' to do an’ orl day to do it in. Wot are
they goin’ ter give you fur actin’ as M.C., old
pal ? ”
Mr. Maunder grinned.
“Never you mind, Sam, that’s my business ;
arst no questions and you’ll be told no untruths.
Well, s’long, I must be movin’. I ’ope it’ll soon
be brought ’ome to you wot a sinner you are,
same as I wos once, afore I found Pease.”
He shuffled away with his customary crab-like
gait, leaving Mr. Sharp staring after him, a bale-
ful smile playing about his thin, pinched lips.
Two or three weeks later, upon a drizzling
Thursday evening, Mr. Maunder, wondrously
respectable in a cast-off broadcloth coat, once the
property of Brother Stubbs, stood at the open
door of the diminutive meeting-house of the
Primitive Apostles, distributing red booklets and
unctuous welcomes among the multitude. The
little room was filled, and the mixed odors of
damp garments and damp humanity combined to
create an atmosphere almost tangible in its ex-
treme solidity. The flaring gas-jets flickered in
the draught which found an entry at the open
door, and an antiquated harmonium wheezed
asthmatically from a corner of a narrow platform
at the far end of the hall.
Haying broken the back of his labors, Mr.
Maunder released his features from the fettering
influence of an oleaginous smile, and, taking a
seat in a broken-bottomed cane chair, which
stood in the cramped lobby, composed him-
self, as was his wont, for the refreshment of
forty winks. But he had barely closed his eyes
when a light touch on the arm aroused him. Fie
gazed up at the disturber of his peace. Mr.
Samuel Sharp, overflowing with the milk of
human kindness, nodded and smiled down upon
the agitated Primitive Apostle.
“Why, Jerry,” he said, with a touch of tender
reproach, “’ow’s this—ain’t you got nothink ter
say ter me ? ’Ere ’ave I bin waitin’ five minutes
fur one of them pretty little ’ymn books, an’ you
ain’t so much as said ‘ Welcome, little stranger.’ ”
With a manifest effort Mr. Maunder swallowed
the wild, wicked words that came to the tip of
his tongue.
“ Look’ere, Sam Sharp,” he said in a husky
whisper, “ this ain’t no place fur the likes o’ you.
Just clear out, quick an’ lively, afore I calls a
John.”
“Well, well, Jerry,” said the wounded Mr.
Sharp, “ I wouldn’t ha’ thought it possible. ’Ere
am I, a undegenerate sinner wot wants ter be
done good to, and you threatens me with a John
’Op. It’s crool ’ard. Whatever would Brother
Stubbs say ? Oh, this is ’arsh ! ”
At this psychological moment a short, rotund
individual, habited in a rusty black suit, whitened
at the seams, intervened.
“ Wot’s this, Brother Maunder ?” he inquired,
with a marked degree of displeasure. “ Surely
you wouldn’t keep a lost sheep from the fold
becos ’e ’asn’t got on a weddin’ garment like me
and you ? ”
The rebuked Mr. Maunder murmured some-
thing unintelligible concerning the operation
commonly spoken of as fleecing, a remark which,

Do von know that
Rheumatism, Dropsy,

kidneys when healthy
filter the blood ; when
weak or diseased they
cannot do their work,
and the whole body

them. Doan’s Backache Kidney Bills are a kidney medi-
cine and a Kidney Medicine only. They keep the kidneys

kidney disease is fatal.
Sydney People Cured.
A Sydney Man.
Mr. Jos. Hamon, Painter and Paperhanger, 3 Stanley Street, Sydney, says:
“At intervals during the past five years I have suffered with kidney trouble. I
had an aching back, which was particularly bad when I had any stooping to do. I
tried plasters, but they had no beneficial effect. I then procured Doan’s Backache
Kidney Pills, and since using them have had no return of the pain ; in fact, all
trace of kidney trouble has left me.” ||H
Eight years later Mr. Hamon says: “I was very bad with my kidneys
previous to using Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, but I am very pleased to say
that this remedy cured me. I have recommended these pills to a great many
people, and they are favorably spoken of by all who use them.”
A Sydney Woman.
Mrs. E. A. Bruce, Broughton Road, Artarmon, Sydney, says : “I suffered for
a long time with severe pains in my back. They were so bad that I could scarcely
move about. Rest was out of the question. I would be tossing about all night,
moaning with the pain. I could not bend my back, and I had to neglect my work.
I was really very ill, and would be confined to bed for days at a time. I saw
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills advertised as a cure for backache, and got a box.
After a few doses I got relief, and then gradually I got better, until I was quite
cured. There is no doubt about it being a cure, for it is two years since I stopped
taking the pills, and I’ve not had the backache all that time. I cannot tell you
how pleased I am to be free of the backache, and if sufferers will only try Doan’s
Backache Kidney Pills, there will be no aching backs.”
DOAN’S BACKACHE KIDNEY PILLS are sold by all Chemists and
Storekeepers at 2/9 per box (six boxes 15/3), or will be posted on receipt

ECZEMA,
Nothing spoils a good disposition quicker.
Nothing taxes a man’s patience
Like any irritation of the skin ;
Piles almost drive you mad.
All day they make you miserable, all night
they keep you awake.
Just the same with Eczema. Such miseries
are daily decreasing. People are learning
they can be cured. Learning the merit of
Doan’s Ointment. Plenty of proof that
Doan’s Ointment will cure Piles, Eczema
or any skin irritation.
Mrs. Fletcher, 81 Bellevue Street, North
Sydney, says:—“For some months I suffered
with a form of Eczema, which broke out
on my legs and arms. The irritation was
so dreadful at night that I could not sleep.
I used a great number of remedies, but none
of them gave me any ease. I commenced
to think that there was no cure for Eczema,
but a treatment of Doan’s Ointment proved
that I was wrong in this. The first apph'
cation gave me ease, and a few pots cured
me. This was two years ago, and I have
never had a sign of the ailment since. -1°
all who suffer with Eczema I recommen
Doan’s Ointment.” Do not neglect any sign
of skin trouble, for it is very hard to cur
and may become chronic. At the first sign
get Doan’s Ointment, the great specific tor
every torturing skin irritation. ■^° aD
Ointment is sold by all - chemists and store-
keepers at 2/9 per pot, or will be ppsted o

But be sure you get DOAN’S.
by reason of its apparent irrelevancy, was allowed
to pass unheeded.
“ This way, brother ; follow me, please,” said
the little man, and, to Jerry’s apprehension, he
saw the unflinching Mr. Sharp pass up the
crowded body of the hall, and, for want of spa.ce
elsewhere, on to the platform, the holy of holies
itself, where he was accommodated with a rickety
chair and a rubicund hymn-book.
The subsequent proceedings were of the nature
of a nightmare to the perspiring Mr. Maunder.
Hymn succeeded hymn. Long-winded and un-
grammatical petitions, punctuated with hollow
groans, were hurled relentlessly ceilingwards.
Brother Stubbs addressed his flock at considerable
length, and, inter alia , drew a lively picture of
the probable effects of a Hereafter spent in an
excessive temperature. Two women, overcome
by the heat of his denunciations and the closeness
of the conventicle, demonstrated hysterically, and
fainted away. They were both generously pro-
portioned, and Mr. Maunder s temper was not
improved by the fact. (It was a recognised part of
his duties to assist in the conveyance of such
victims, 'from the spot where they fell into the
open air.) He was still panting grievously from
the effect of his arduous toils, when, as if in a
hideous dream, he beheld Mr. Sharp, after a
moment’s whispered conference with sundry
elders of the Primitive Apostles, rise from his
seat and advance to the extreme edge of the plat-
form. Brother Stubbs hoisted himself ponder-
ously to his feet, and held up a hand.
“My friends,” he proclaimed, in Boanerges-
like tones. “We have here to-night a dear
stranger brother, a sojourner in our great
necropolis, who wdshes to give us his testimony.
May his words be fraught with the sperrit of
truth and love, and find a ready soil and fructify
in the bosom of each one of you.”
He sat down heavily, and breathed hard. Mr.
Sharp smiled ingratiatingly.
‘ • Oh, my deer brothers an’sisters,” he began,
with disagreeable fluency. “ Unaccustomed as I
am ter speakin’ in public, I feel as ’ow I must say
a few words ter you to-night with ref rence ter
that old gentleman over there by the door—’im
with the grey whiskers an’ somebody else’s coat
on, wot the reverend gen’leman as ’as jest set
down found in jug—jail, I meanter say—doin’ a
month’s ’ard fur not ’avin’ no visible means o’
substance.”
Every head in the hall turned with automatic
precision, and every eye sought the features of
the embarrassed Mr. Maunder.
“Well, me deer friends,” continued Mr. Sharp,
pleasingly conscious of the impression he had
created. “I don’t like ter see good kind-jearted
peoples deceived, ’specially w’en they’re Prim’tive
’Postles, so I’ll jist tell you a true but ’orrible story
of wot ’appened ter me an’ ’im w’en we wos
shipmates together five year ago come October.
“ I ’ad signed articles as carpenter aboard the
sailin’ ship Tfllymakus, in Sydney, and old Jerry
Maunder —’im as you calls Brother Maunder —•
were cook. I wos very glad ter see ’im, becos I
’adn’t got the measure of his foot in them days, or
I wouldn’t ’ave so much as looked at ’im with the
fur end of a barge pole, but as it ’appened, w’en I
wos orf dooty, I wos fur ever in ’is galley ’elpin’
’im ter wash up an’ the like, seein’ as ’ow ’e were
very slow an’ dirty, pore old man, and the skipper
couldn’t abide ter set ’is eyes on ’im. ‘’E alius
reminds me of a griller, Mr. Sharp,’ ’e says ter
me one day, an’ I says, ‘ P’raps if we wos ter look
inside of ’im we’d find a lovin’ ’eart ! ’ ”
There was a laudable disposition on the part of
certain Primitive Apostles to greet this sentiment
with approving groans, but the upraised hand of
Brother Stubbs besought silence.
“We ’ad terrible rough weather from the time
we left the ’Eads,” resumed Sam, “an’ w’en we
wos a fortnight out the Tillymakus sprung a leak.
We worked at the pumps day an’ night, but it
weren't no good, an’ orl of a sudden, without no
warnin’, she give a great roll an’ sunk to the
bottom o’ the sea. I disremember nothink
further,” pursued the imaginative orator, with a
hurried lick of his lips, “ till I found meself lyin’
more alive than dead in the dingy, with old Jerry
Maunder bendin’ over me, an’ the ship’s boy,
’Arry Stokoe, sobbin’ out ’is ’eart as if it would
break. We wos the on’y three saved out o’ the
’ole crew. Orl the pervisions we ’ad wos a small
keg o’ water, a bag o’ ship’s biscuit, an’, funny
enuff, a bottle o’ musheroom catchup wot old
Jerry ’ad caught up in ’is ’aste, thinkin’ it wos
brandy, ’im bein’ very given to intoxificatin’
lickers, as I dessay you’ve found out fur yer-
selves long afore this.”
A feeble remonstrance from the back of the
hall was stifled by the indignant “ Hush !
Hush ! ” of a breathless and expectant auditory.
“ Fur a week we drifted on a stormy hocean,
at the mersey o’ the winds an’ waves,” continued
the gratified Sam, “ thinkin’ every minute wos the
previous one, an’ on the eighth day there weren’t a
drop o’ water or a crumb o’ biscuit left. I didn’t
mind fur meself; me suff’rin’s wos so crool that eat
I could not, but I was sorry fur the pore boy, an’
with good reason, as I’m agoin’ ter tell you of.
That same evenin’, I wos stretched out, on’y ’alf-
conscientious, w’en old Jerry crawls up an’
whispers in me ear. ‘ Sam,’ he says (me name’s
Sam Sharp, brothers an’ sisters), ‘ we ain’t got
nothin’ left but a bottle o’ catchup, an’ by the
Lord,’ says ’e, with a dreadful laugh, ‘ ef I on’y
’ad a chop ter eat with it I’d die ’appy tomorrer.’
‘Wot do you mean by them words, Jerry?’ I
arsted ’im. ‘ You carn’t git no chops in the
middle of the Pacific Hocean,’ savs I. ‘ P’raps
not,’ ’e answers me back, ‘ but, Sam, I could cut
a steak off of that ’ere boy wot would make a
vegitarian’s mouth water.’ ‘Jerry,’ I says, too
’orrified ter speak, ‘ not while I lives. You shall
eat that ps'/a boy acrost my dead body,’ says I.
He didn’t.piss no further remarks jest then, an’
so overtocyK wos I by ’is awful ’ints that I fell
back an’ knew no more. Furst thing I done w’en
I come to wos ter: open me eyes and look fur
’Arry Stokoe. He ’ad disappeared, an’ so ; ad the
bottle o’ catchup, while old Jerry Maunder ’e wos
settin’ in the stern with a ’appy peaceful smile on
’is face like a bore-constructer. ‘ I’ve done it,
Sam,’ ’e says, as soon as ’e saw I wos lookin’ at
’im, ‘ an’ a juicier boy never walked this earth,’
says ’e. ‘Jerry,’ I says, ‘ may you be furgive as
I furgive you this day.’ Then I fainted dead
orf, an’ oh, small wonder, me deer friends,
seein’ as ’ow I wos torkin’ to a cannon-
ball. That very same arternoon, thanks be.
we wos picked up by a steamer, the ’Alifax, bound
from Switzerland to the interior of Asia. Twice
I tried ter tell me tale to the Capt’n, but twice
somethin’ choked me words back, an’ the ’orrible
secret remained locked up in me boosom. That
were five year ago now, but to-night I felt as I
must speak w’en I see’d that old man settin’ there
like a sheep in wolfs clothes. It seemed a kind
o’ desiccation, an’ if I ’adn’t of spoke I d never
’ave knowed another ’appy hour.”
Mr. Sharp ceased with dramatic abruptness,
and, gliding unobtrusively from the platform,
passed swiftly down the 'hall. At the door he
paused for an instant and regarded its hapless
custodian with twinkling eyes.
“You’ll find me over at the ’Orns, Jerry,” he
whispered, and slipped out into the night.
* * * *
Half an hour before closing time Sam Sharp,
propped up against the bar of his favorite
hostelry, noted a grey, close-cropped bullet head
as it was thrust inquisitively between a pair of
swing doors.
“ Got the boot, Jerry?” he enquired, genially.
“ Don’t be down-’earted, matey —if s orl fur the
best, b’lieve me. You’d never ha’ made a
Prim’tive ’Postle wot with that ’ere ’ungry appe-
tite o’ yers. Pore ’Arry Stokoe ! Well, wodger
goin’ ter ’ave ? A small catchup ? ”
Mr. Maunder grinned a slow, sour grin.
Ten minutes later :
“ One thin’ nearly upset me apple-cart though,”
remarked Sam, assisting himself to an overdose
of whisky in the temporary absence of the ring-
letted Hebe. “ Cons’quence wos I thought it best
ter cut me ’arrowin’ tale short. Five year ago I
were doin’ six month in jug—never mind woffor
—an’ the bloke in the vurry nex’ cell ter mine
wos —’oo d’ye think ? ”
Mr. Maunder shook his head.
“ Give it up, Sam,” he said, deftly retrieving
a fly of suicidal tendencies from his glass, and
administering first aid with the heel of his boot.
“ Brother Stubbs ! ” sniggered Sam.
“Lor’ lumme!” said Mr. Maunder with a
raucous chuckle. “ Did ’e twig yer, Sam ? ”
“’Ow shud I know? You’d better arst’im,
Jerry,” said Sam, simply.
LAWRENCE B. JUPP.
Prehistoric Brown.
[FOR THE BULLHTIN.]
IT was in an ice-bound region in the first red
dawn of Man
That this feud of haggard ages with my
neighbor Brown began,
And I couldn’t say for certain now what moved
us first to strike,
But I rather think it must have been a mut-u-al
dislike.
Many days before I met him they were talking in
the snow.
“ Have you met the Brown One, dearest? He’s
the poet man, you know.
Such a dear ! You ought to meet him.” So I
heard them standing near,
Then retired within my cave to put an edge upon
my spear.
With this warlike preparation I meandered round
the town,
Holding tightly to the weapons I had fixed for
Brother Brown.
And I found him on a mountain, and I yelled in
anger “Now !”
Then I banged my trusty waddy on his pre-
historic brow.
While I gasped in childish wonder at his bulging
intellect
He grew horribly ferocious, and his aim was so
correct,
That before I realised it, or the pangs of parting
felt,
My poetic locks were hanging at my hated rival’s
belt.
Then I chased him down the mountain side, de
manding back my hair,
But he reached the huts before me, and I gazed in
blank despair
As the tribe collected round him, like a swarm of
angry bees,
And the frenzied yells of triumph floated down
upon the breeze.
For a moon or so I shadowed all the former haunts
of Brown,
But the enemy was wary, and I could not bring
him down ;
So I finally betook me to a lonely mountain lair
That had lately been vacated by an aged Polar
bear.
In my pre-historic mansion I resided many years,
Dreaming day and night of vengeance, till—l
state the fact with tears —
I observed the tribal sexton waiting patiently out-
side,
And he beckoned me to follow, so .. . I think I
must have died !
Did I wake up at a meeting ? Was it all a vision
pale ?
No! A highly-cultured person told a highly-
cultured tale,
And he wore a massive bump upon his literary
crown,
That resembled much the one I’d raised on pre-
historic Brown !
With a thrill of exultation then, I seized my
trusty gamp,
And fell furiously on him as he babbled by the
lamp,
And I howled with joy insanely when, as rolling
on the floor,
I smote upon the lump I’d raised ten million
years before.
There’s a valued member missing from a high
society,
Nevermore will he read papers on “ What Shak-
speare Had for Tea ; ”
Nevermore will lamp-light glitter on the high and
noble crown
That I made for next to nothing on the late
lamented Brown.
