A Remarkable Criticism.
Jf Henry George’s great work were gene-
rally known to the public of this colony by
perusal, instead of by scrappy excerpts and
condensed description, a deliberate attempt
to prove it a series of blunders would be as
fair as it would be likely to be harmless. But
to pick positions from any work which de-
pends upon consecutiveness of reasoning,
and to deal with those positions as though
they comprised all the reasoning of the I
author, is dishonest, and may be mischievous
when such partial demonstration is dissemi-
nated among people who have no accurate
acquaintance with the work thus abused.
This plan of anticipating in New South
Wales the dissemination of George’s treatise
has been undertaken. Wealth held without
corresponding exertion is ever jealous -and
timid, and has at all epochs been able to
command the services of hired bravos of the
sword and of the pen, according to the
fashion of the time, whose function it has
ever been to quell the insurrection of op-
pressed peoples, or becloud and misrepre-
sent the ebullitions of unshackled intellect.
The staff of the Sydney Morning Herald
has been commissioned to cover George’s
facts and demonstrations with a cloud of
confusion and contradiction ; and as the
work itself is not yet fully current here—
very few copies having been procur-
able—the task may be within their abili-
ties, as it conforms to the tastes of
these willing slaves of almighty Property.
After all, we are not, sure that it matters
much. To men free to think for themselves
without forfeiture of salary or of that com-
fortable mental slumber which agreement
with everything conventionally settled up
to date affords, the great work of George will
shine as a sun, piercing and dispersing every
prejudice and preconception which labori-
ous sophistry may create. We should have
said “men free to think, and capable of
thinking.” The Herald may take heart of
grace. The number is inconsiderable. In
serious earnest, we do not expect for
George’s demonstrations any great recep-
tion from Australians of this generation.
In all countries the weight of established
influence and respectability will be against
the acceptance of these ideas, as a matter of
course. A system which would abolish the
enjoyment of accidental advantage, and
tend to a fair distribution of the gifts of
Nature, can appear only horrible and offen-
sive to those who hold such advantages, or
imagine their personal interests bound up
in the perpetuauce of the system denounced.
• « •
It may be accepted at once that George’s
ideas are not “respectable.” It follows
almost as a matter of course that they are
also “ impious.” The great human organi-
sations which style themselves “churches”
are invariably so closely allied with the
dominant classes that they have gradually
made it an implied article of religion that
all change or desire for change is wicked.
It is well for mankind that that vast con-
spiracy, the Church of Rome, has no longer
a monopoly of the pretended claims to
rule men’s consciences. Had it still
the influence it exerted prior to the
reformation, George’s “ Progress and
Poverty ” would simply have been cata-
logued in the IndexExpurgatorlns, and there
would have been an end of the matter. As
it is, the Church of Rome is, perhaps, less
absolutely leagued with aristocratic institu-
tions than the Church of England. It is
probable that the Vatican will denounce
Jorge’s philosophy; it is*certain that no
clergyman of the Church of England who
does not loudly declare his abhorrence of
the man and all his works can ever hope to
prosper. What owner of “a living” would
confer it on a man who agrees that the lay
ownership is a sin and a scandal ? If the
principles embodied in “Progress and
Poverty” win any adherents in the Church
of England, it will be among the most in-
considerable, in a worldly sense, of its
ministers. For promotion will certainly
abandon ministers who fly in the face of
those fortunate persons who have power to
promote. The division of the Protestant
Church into numerous sects gives an ad-
vantage to all progressive ideas. Those
religious communities which are least es-
teemed, in a worldly sense, are often-times
instrumental in reconciling Christianity
with piinciples which it had discarded or
forgotten. Thus the ideas of which Henry
George is the modern expositor, and of
which Jtsus Christ was an earlier expon-
ent, will find no endorsement in t the more
splendid temples in which redundantly
salaried divines help congregations of
wealthy “dissenters” to believe that they
can reconcile sharp business habits with
devotion to the principles of the Christian
religion. Butin Little Bethel, where a busy-
brained cobbler holds forth to congrega-
tions of earnest or excitable labourers who
find the world a hard place, and look to the
next as likely to be a great improvement,
the suggestion that “Thy Kingdom come”
may really have a mundane realization, as
the Saviour and his Apostles taught, and
for centuries all Christians believed, may
be received with considerable alacrity.
• • •
The most remarkable feature, in fact, of
Mr. George's system is its extraordinary
harmony with the primitive principles of
Christianity, before the teachings of our
Saviour became overlaid, corrupted, and
obscured by theological compromises con-
ceived m the interests of temporal expedi-
ency. This is only rendered the more appar-
ent to any man who has examined his own
heart in a candid spirit, by the character of
the objections which are levelled at George’s
proposals. This [is sharply defined in the
criticism which proceeds from the office ©f
the S. M. Herald. Hays this authority :
“ He (George) says that the conflict will
wage more over the question ‘Is it right?’
than ‘Is it wise?’” The Herald objects
strenuously. “ We hope it will not,” it ex-
claims. Now, this is exactly the attitude of
mind which has frittered away the essence
of Christianity. Christ indicated certain
clear precepts. In the Sermon on the Mount
He explicitly condemned “public worship,”
so called;—“Aud when thou prayest, thou
shalt not be as the hypocrites are; for they
love to pray standing in the synagogues
and the streets, that they be seen of
men. . . But thou, when thou prayest,
enter into thy closet,” &c. Again, He is
equally clear about accumulating “ pro-
perty." “Lay not up for yourselves treasures
on earth. . . For where the treasure Is,
there will the heart be also.” And, again,
“ All things whatsoever that ye would have
that men should do unto you, do ye even so
unto them.” And in the all-sufficient form
of prayer he recommended is the petition,
“ Forgive us our debts as wo forgive our
debtors.” Now, if we apply to this the
Herald’s text —not whether it is right, but
whether it is wise to live up to these prin-
ciples—common sense, worldly prudence,
self-interest all unite in declaring that al-
though—being the inspired teaching of the
Saviour —it must be right, it will not be
wise to shape one’s life in accordance with
these principles. To observe them would be
to court beggary to begin with, and all the
ills which follow in the wake of penury.
No business man could hold his ground were
he to be perpetually forgiving his debtors.
The world has seen the impossibility of act-
ing up to this, and a theology has been con-
veniently framed to suit the demand for a
comfortable compromise. Thus we have
every Sunday our synagogues crowded with
professing disciples of Christ, who, in direct
contravention of his teaching, actually pray
as the hypocrites do, standing, that they may
be seen of men. And the main support of
many churches consists of an elite of ad-
herents who are enabled to strengthen them
by the very circumstance that the business
of their lives is to “ heap up treasure.”
Practical Christianity is not wise, and
George’s theories carried into practice would
be, for similar reasons, not' wise. It does not
seem to occur to the sagacious worldlings—
the men who succeed in striking a real com-
promise which insures to them comfort-
able times in this world and the next—that
their wisdom may be foolishness. They
are at odds with their Saviour in thi 9
matter. The tendency to dodge plain in-
structions because they seemed hard and
impracticable was foreseen. In the same
address the Teacher expressly provided
for the contingency, “Whosoever heareth
these sayings of mine and doeth them, 1 will
liken unto a wise man.. . . And every one
that heareth these sayings of mine and
doeth them not, I will liken unto a foolish
| man.”
• • 9
But the small wisdom sits in judgment
upon the greater wisdom, and undertakes to
show that what was plainly said could not
have been meant, because the small wisdom
cannot comprehend what will come of it.
Hence we get the determination to let policy
prevail over abstract right. “In politics,’*
says our Mentor of the Herald “expediency
is the grand test by which we are to be gui„
ded.” Here we have a striking ex empliflcation
of the influence of the fundamental error al-
ready indicated. Politics is here treated as
though it were a thing distinct from religion.
The Herald would never have dared to put
it that “ in religion the great test by which
we have to be guided is expediency.” The
assumption is that mankind can be shufflers
and play fast and loose with the eternal
verities in politics, or political economy, and
do no wreng. In short, that religion is a
thing apart from the conduct of human
affairs. That devious paths, and inhumani-
ties, and falsities, and injustices, and
violences, if only carried out on a scale big
enough to entitle them to the name of
“ policy,” cease to be sins. The terrible error
here is the stumbling block of the epoch.
That religion consists of ceremonials, and is s
separate department of life, and that there
are many things external to it. Whereas the
vital truth is, that it is not the standing up
to pray in the synagogues, or the periodical
or partial devotion which constitute religion,
but that the religion of a man or a nation
is all his life and all his policy. Neither man
nor nation can be swindler and robber in
action or policy, and saintly in repose,
or at stated periods, or in reference

Where it seems that the foolishness
of those who “heard these things and

faith and comprehension. If one man

tianity amidst our spurious institutions, ruin

But if all men would but follow those pre-
cepts—why,[there is the Kingdom upon Earth,
right away. But it is hopeless to suppose
that all men will. The millenium is a Divine
promise, but it is hopelessly far ahead !

true, it could not he practically carried out;

printed the foregoing sentence in italics,
because we wish to emphasize an obligation
we have to own. We have borrowed that
sentence verbatim from the Herald’s writer,
by whom it was applied to the theories of
Henry George ! We are, then, not to listen
to the millenium promptings, not to work
towards the Kingdom-come, because the
perfecting of human nature is one condition

There was some pretence made a little time ago,
when the frightful catastrophe at the Kink
Theatre in Vienna had attracted unusual and
horrified attention to the dangerous arrangement
of the outlets to places of public entertainment,
of having such buildings In Sydney Inspected and
regulated. The old Queen’s Theatre was con-
demned, and a door or two knocked in the walls of
some others. But anyone who attended the last
concerts given by the Sydney Liedertafel, or, in
fact, any entertainment, in the Protestant Hall,
must have seen that, so far as that building, or
proper supervision of internal fittings is concerned,
the protended inspection has been a sham. The
“ means of egress” from the galleries are so con-
structed that in case of a rush they would prove
mere death-traps. The doorways (two in number)
may be adequate—although that is doubtful. But
one Hap of the southern door has been closed by a
temporary but substantial wooden structure for a
cloak-room. Probably the other door la in the
same case. Anyway, were the doors in every respect
sufficient, they lead to stairs so totally vicious in
construction that a frightened crowd could not by
any miracle escape horrible death there. The flights
are steep; there are sudden twists; and it requires
the utmost care and deliberation to descend them
without accident in a throng, even when every
one is taking time and proceeding with caution,
os everyone instinctively does when descending
those dangerous (lights. The authorities should
Insist upon the means of escape being rectified in
that Hall. Should there occur any catastrophe
after this warning, the trustees of the hall will be
guilty of manslaughter without extenuating cir-
cumstances.
When a circus is in town one can usually pretty
accurately guago its average performing merit by
the noise its band makes, i.e„ if one only takes the
precaution of calculating the excellence as being
in inverse ratio to the din. So with some other
things—Including Churches. Whenever the drum
ecclesiastic is beaten most loudly, then, in ninety-
nine cases out of a hundred, one won’t be far
wrong in coming to the conclusion that the troops
in the clerical garrison are endeavouring to supply
deficiency with sound. Dr. Barry gave a good
loud roulade on his episcopal tambour just before
It aving England. Speaking of that new develop-
ment of England’s power-the Greater Britain—
he specially referred to what he called “our
National Church,” which (having identified It with
Christianity), he declared, had before it “a future
of energy and triumph, even If revolutionary
power should shake the institutions of our society
and threaten the time-honoured landmarks of law
and of 1 tilth.” Surely a largo order this I when In
the old England the’’National” Church Is decaying,
and in the Greater Britain there is no such thing I
King Tawhaio and Queen Tawhaio.
The passing visit of the Maori Sovereign has
invested that potentate with some interest.
It is not every day that there is a chance of
seeing a king, who is generally so hedged
around with “divinity” and sycophants as
to be inaccessible. King Tawhaio, however,
is an exception. The chief of a disappearing
race, he has no favours or fortunes to bestow
—no “honours” to confer; nothing, save
the poor title, to attract lickspittles. Con-
sequently, he has been comparatively neg-
lected by the tribe of flunkeys who abase
themselves whenever a visitor allied to a
more practical Royalty comes within hail.

that the bet had been paid, took out a summons
against him in the Rockhampton Court, got a

into his house, for which act a Supreme Court

MAORI ROYALTY.
KINO TAWHAIO AND HIS CONSORT.


DENOMINATIONAL DROPS
In the House of Lords the prayers are
even more mechanical than In the Commons. The
late Lord Grey used to tell a story of having 1 seen
that pillar of orthodoxy, Lord Eldon, eorrecting a
private Act of Parliament whilst on his knees at
these prayers. On Lord Grey expressing surprise
at this, the Chancellor replied, “D It, you
would do it in church if you were worked to death
as I am.”
Yet another. The
Bev. Canon White, of
Musclebrook, is off for
the orthodox continental
« spree.” He bagged the
usual testimonial and 240
sovereigns before start_
ing. Thorough “ white-
men” those Muscle-
brookers.
The Rev. Fred. C.
Boyer, newly appointed
Minister of the York-
street Wesleyan Church,
is a good all round mus-
ician, and especially
shines as a performer on
the organ.
An English farmer,
recently called on to pay
£8 10s. for Church tithes,
resisted the claim. There-
upon the rector of the
parish took proceedings,
and seized a haystack.
The bailiff who took
formal possession did not
consider it necessary to
sleep on the premises, as
he sbould have done, and
when the property was
offered at auction, theie
were no outside bidders,
and it was finally knocked
down to the man of God
himself for £2. When he
Eroceeded to Investigate
is purchase, however,
he lound, with pious
horror, that it consisted
of hedge trimmings, hop
vines, dead leaves, and
other rubbish, with a
thin coating of hay out-
side, worth a few shil-
lings—a regular tip-top
illustration of the old
gentleman’s religion :
rottenness at the core,and
an outside veneer of
piety, holiness and all the
virtues extant.
Primate Harry, in
his sermon in Christ’s
Church, South Y a r r a
(Vic.), on the 2nd instant,
retailed the Dream of
Wesley in a very impres-
sive manner. It may be re-
marked that Wesley once
dreamed he had been
transported to the gates
of heaven, and, given to
interrogations as he was,
he stood there and asked,
“Are there Papists in
there?” Silence. “Are
there Presbyterians in
there ?” Silence. “ Are
there Lutheransln
there?” Silence. And so
on round all the denom-
inations of Christianity
that the pious zealot
could find the names of.
To every question, how-
ever, the same chill
silence was the only
response. “Are there
Christians in there?”
asked Wesley at last.
Then the whole court of
heaven burst into mel-
ody, and Wesley awoke
with a new thought in
his head. The friraate
made a great “hit” with
this anecdote, in hie
argument that when the
State menaces the use of
the Bible in the Public
ftchooisall the denomina-
tions should join hands
and pull together. But
easy a bit. Surely it is an
easy consciousness of the
fitness of things that
appliesWesley’s beautiful
dream to the subject
matter in hand, and as
easy a consciousness of
the meaning of te,rms
that enthusiastically ac-
cepts the application.
Why, the refusal of the
State to permit religious
Instruction in the Public
Schools has, as its most
vital consequence, the
annihilation of distinc-
tive sects. Is not this
consequence in accord
with Wesley’s dream?
The Primate’s exhorta-
tion was intelligible, and,
as a strategic manoeuvre,
is the only effective way
to put the State in a
corner, but the illustra-
tion which loot the charm
to the exhortation carries
anyone who wiil take the
trouble to think right
away about to the other
camp.
Bishop Barry loquitur: —“ Of any questions
•r discussions which may have been created in the
past with regard to the filling of this See, I have
known nothing, and I desire to know nothing.”
Loud applause—from the low churchmen who
during the election proceedings hadn’t scrupled
to speak very nasty spiteful things about the
heterodoxy of one Alfred Barry, Principal of
King’s College, London. Naturally these men are
pleased to know that their malicious words are not
to be east up against them.
We read in Uie Bokhal O’Kane how a
** travelling correspondent of the Church of
Bngland,” on arriving per ooach at a town not far
from Charters Towers, alighted, and seeing a sub-
stantial looking private residence made tracks for
it, and said, “ Mr. Blank, will you give a Keeris-
tian gentleman luncheon.” Blank pointed to the
hotel over ttl& way, but the holy man eventually
got at the soft side of Blank, who asked him in.
At the end of a week the pious one said he had
lost his purse, and had not the wherewithal, to pay
his way to the next town ; the good-natured
Blank procured him a cheap ride from a friend,
and also lent him a cheque for 33s. When this
Angler-can got to the end of his journey he said,
“Mr. Blank is a very nice gentleman, but he is a
D. flat.”
Beat the tom-tom and send round the
plate, dearly beloved, for the support of the
mission to the heathen of Booridilchooska, and
shut your eyes fast against such reports as this
(clipped from the Gennedah Independent) “ A
drunken mother, followed by three children,
whose ages varied from about three to eight years
was to be seen staggering about Barber-street
yesterday morning. Almost every person she
met she treated to a volley of oaths and vile
language; and occasionally showered some on
her dttle children,” Woe to such hypocrisy as
compasses sea and land to make the islanders of
the sea believe In a Christianity veneered with
British commercial economy and missionary trade
principles, and glibly talks of the civilising in-
fluences of its pinchbeck creed, while in our own
population centres, where those influences have
been in operation for years, there are men,
women, and children by hundreds who are in-
finitely more degraded than the heathen. Why,
that unsexed Guonedah mother swearing at her
children, in her beast-like drunkenness, would
appal a heathen—if he were innocent of rum,
missionary, and shoddy.
Austin PembeT is on the right track
towards a mighty big truth when in bis Jnst pub-
lished “Pericles Brum” he writes:—“A certain
philosopher, being desirous of describing the con-
test betwixt reason and the priesthood, thus spoke:
‘ Bewildered in an immense forest during the
night, and having only one small torch for my
guide, a stranger approaches and thus addresses
me, Friend, blow out thy torch if thou wouldst
make sure ot the right path.’ This stranger was a
priest. The idea is cognate to that of W. C.
Bennett, whore he says: —
“ A people dwelt in darkness,
In gloom and blinding night,
Till some grew tired of candles,
And dared to Jong for light;
When straight the established lanterns
Were stirred with hate of day,
And loud and lawful rushlights
In wrath were heard to say:
O, have you not your lanterns ?
Your little shining lanterns ?
What need have you of sunshine ?
What do you want with day ?”
Quakers in the United Kingdom number
18,000, of whom some 2000 (33 congregations) are in
the Lon ion district. The Bedford Institute, Spital-
fields (named after the late Peter Bedford), is the
centre of a home mission, including similar estab-
, Bunhill-fields, Bethnail-greea, Kat-
cliff, Clerkenwell, Deptford, and a convalescent
cottage at Epping. 1800 children and adults regu-
larly attend the schools and gatherings. A hundred
and thirty friends give their services as teachers
and helpers. Income from subscriptions, about
£3100 per annum. Lending libraries, magic lantern
lectures, young men’s mutual improvement asso-
ciations, temperance bands of hope, cricket and
football clubs, sewing classes, clubs for procuring
blankets, boots, and bedding, adult classes, a
school for sookery, a flower mission, penny banks,
and free Sunday breakfasts for the homeless among
the varied forms of work. The promotion of
temperance a prominent feature in all Its branches.
In the summer months, emersions, outings, and
cricket clubs are well encouraged. For wet
weather and winter, libraries, lectures, and discus-
sion classes are rendered available. Occasionally,
industrial exhibitions and cookery competitions
are held. The committee of the Bedford Institute
have established near their premises a temperance
colfee tavern. The convalescent cottage at Epping
has received within a few years more than 10C®
inmates. A charge of 3s. a week for board and
lodging is required from each Inmate, and half-
price for children. And all this sort of work is
carried on without any attempt at proselytism.
“The Departed Qliosts of Dead Men” is
the title of a lecture In which one, Tom Owen,
seeks to substitute for the orthodox notion that
the body Is but a tabernacle for the soul which is
the man, his own ideas that the body is the man,
and that when the body dies the man dies never to
go again until “ the Lord Jesus Christ shall descend
from heaven with a shout” waking “ the sleeping
dead to life and immortality.” Orthodox folks
may be right in their notion, so may Owen be in
his. Both notions deal, according to the agnostics,
with the absolutely unknowable; and as far as
these are concerned, it’s about six of one and
half-a-dozen of the other. Their maxim is—
Here is our good and our treasure store.
This let us gather and crave no more.
This world is lovely whate’er befall—
We know not the Power behind it all.
They hold that man “knows not” and has no
means by which to acquire a knowledge of the
after life (if there be an after life) hence nis specu-
lations about it are of less worth than the shadow
of thistledown.

A queer scene hap-
pened in the Hobart
Wesleyan Chapel the
other week. After the
Rev. Lavers had wound
up his “ discoorse ” a Sal-
vation Army man In the
congregation mounted
a seat and began to
hold forth in true har-
monious style. The par-
son and his hearers for a
time were dumbfounded,
and just as a suggestion
to kick the intruder out
was about to be acted on,
the former started a re-
sonant hymn, and the
congregation joining in,
the harmy spouter col-
lapsed into silent prayer.

Under the heading
“A well-deserved Ke-
buke,” the Evening
Nooze recently told the
following story : — “ A
well-merited rebuke was
given to an impatient
member of his congre-
gation by the Rev. J, D.
Langley at St. Simon and
St. Jude’s Church last
night (Sunday). The
gentleman ’ was seated
in the front, near the
pulpit, and attracted the
rev. gentleman’s atten-
tion by pulling out his
watch, looking at the
time, and closing it again
with a loud click, which
was heard nearly all over
the church. The Rev.
Mr. Langley Stopped,
looked at his own watch,
and turning to the im-
patient one, said “ Never
mind the time, it will only
be a quarter of an hour
more. The person addres-
sed looked very uncom-
fortable indeed.” On the
broad hypothesis that
the cad who wrote that
Ear. is not a liar, Mr. J.D
angley must not feel
surprised if people regard
him as a very discourte-
ous and sillyfellow. There
are a hundred reasons
why a man might need to
look at his w a t c h in
church—fer Instance he
might have to catch a
train or a tram or to go
home to administer medi-
cine to a sick friend. For
a minister to cooly as-
sume that a particular
looking at a watch during
sermon time, is an im-
pertinent act deserving
censure,is an exceedingly
impudent assump t i o n,
and a most un - Christian
one to boot, since it im-
putes evil where in all
likelihood no evil is In-
tended, or even if it be
Intended where it is ab-
solutely out of the min-
ister’s power, to say for
certain, that it is in-
tended. As Barry, the
Bishop, says, an educated
clergy is sorely needed—
the education to Include
manners.

President of the United States, on behalf of the
London Local Marine Board. Referring to this
presentation watoh he says ‘ When I left London
the watch was six second* fast, and on my arrival
at Singapore It was only three seconds slow, a
most extroardinary performance for a watch, as I
carried it on my person the whole time. I com-
pared it every day with my chronometers on the
passage out, and It seldom or ever dill'ered one
second from them; in fact, I found it almost if
not as good as my chronometers, which is a great
deal to say for a watch carried about and subjected
o all kinds of Jolts.'"

Dear Sirs—I beg to acquaint you of n marvellous
cure following on the use of St. Jacobs Oil, which
has taken place in my own family. I am a poor
man with eight children, and for years have been
a great sufferer from sciatica. My wife was ad-
vised to try St. Jacobs Oil. She procured a bottle,
and I have been using it of late with good results;
but it is of my eldest daughter, 13 years of age,
that I wish to tell you. She retired one night
about four months ago in her usual good health,
but the next morning she could not speak. My
wife took her to Inverell to see Dr. , who said
her throat was ulcerated low down, aud he pre-
scribed cod liver oil and other medicines: and also
advised her to inhale the fumes of Stockholm tar,
saying she might never recover her speech again.
At the expiration of a fortnight, the medicine
having been finished, another visit to the Dr. was
made, who again prescribed for her, but told my
wife he had no hope of her ever being able to
speak again. We began to despair, but the day I
used the oil—about three months after she was
taken ill—I persuaded my wife, after we had
retired, to use the oil. She got up and
gave the girl two drops in water, and rubbed
it on her throat. Next morning we were
delighted to find that she could talk as well as ever,
and has been able to do so ever since.

Before Buckle had been appointed to suc-

doubtless, but will not act powerfully ; or a man
with sufficient vigour to breathe a new spirit into
Its columns, and to make, in one way or another,
Its influence felt throughout the paper If the
latter, Mr. Chenery’s successor can scarcely be
looked for within the limits of Printing House
Square. Who, then, is he to be ? “ Yates when he

The Marquis of Normnnby, being merely a
quiet and respectable old gentleman of mediocre
parts, has not, politically, found favour In the eyes
of tho Melbourne Age; and the noisy little journal
worked itself up Into a considerable excitement
over tho farewell address, presented to tho out-
Solng Governor. The Aqe, from a high sense of
uty, finds it necessary to explain that “It would
bo most (unfortunate If the Governor whom we
are now expecting should suppose that Lord Nor-
manby was an example to bo imitated, orsh-uld
be led to believe that ho had earned either respect
or affection during his residence amongst us.”
Yet, in its righteous Indignation, the Age has
surely got a wee bit mixed, for, later on, it i emarks
of tho unfortunate Marquis, "If no one can say

The Western Grazier, in referring to the

The Hon. John Macgregor, who died in
Melbourne on the 27th ultimo, was one of tho old
identities whose life was not wholly written on
water. A quarter of a century ago his business
os a solicitor was suffieiently advanced to enable
him to devote a share of his energies to public
questions. For the nextflfteon years'ho woaactlve
and honest in council and debate. There was a
roughness sometimes about him and a doggodnoss
in his manner and demeanour. But a great deal
of his work was good. He might almost be called
the father of tho Bill which determined payment
of members; ho stoutly advocated a national sys
tern of education when the heads of his fellow
colonists were not nearly so clear on the subject as
now: and he lent his arm to the destruction of
State-aid to religion. Ho was not Vlcjtorian born,
but was educated in that colony, having landed
there when a boy of 16. His age at time of death
was 56. It was his own impression that ho was a
Presbyterian, but no doubt ho was mistaken. Ho
sprang from Skye off tho coast, of Scotland, and it
Is to be hoped that ho has now sprung sky-ward
again.
Judge M'Farland was buried on the 7th.
As author of the “Digest of Mining Law of Vic-
toria ” he deserves to ho remembered for some
time. Over 20 years ago he was thrown among a
vast pile of goldfield precedents, regulations, and
practices, through which It was by no moans an
easy thing to explore a passage. Ho succeeded
well, in tho first instance, as a practitioner, and
even better afterwards as a writer. His life was
abort, but up till a low years ago it was an aetivo
one. Perhaps some will say that the Judge’s
bench is also a sphere of great activity, and if it be
so, Judge M’Farland was active throughout. He
was certainly active enough a little time back,
When Nathan’s appeal ease oamo up. Some
thought that on that occasion he lost his head.
His law, however, seems to have been right
«nough, as the event demonstrated. It seems only
fair, with the after light thrown ou his bodily
condition, to place the vagaries of that occasion
to the credit of an Inltrmlty over which he had no
control. He had almost lost the use of his
stomach. His parents are still alive, his father
having carried on the business of a saddler in Bast
Melbourne since he arrived in the colony. The
family came from the North of Ireland over 30 1
years ago, and, as John was then but a boy, he may !
be said to have acquired all his education In the
colony. He died in his 46th year.
J. Dods, the Bourke-street baker, will be
some time before he’ll do it again. Nearly all the
Ills that happen to us are traceable to alcohol or en-
thusiasm. Dods gave way to the latter. He ex-
hibited some household bread at the show in the
Melbourne Exhibition, and, on winning first prize,
appears to have lost, his head. He arranged for
the delivery of batch after batch, and spread the
loaves out on a set of tables in the building, and
made the press free to sample them. Never since
Ceres baked the first cake was there such a spec-
tacle of persistent sampling. When the building
was being shut up at night the line of men with
pencils in their waistcoat pockets that filed down
the steps would have made Colonel Sargood think
that the entire militia force bad been on duty.
This, however, did not satisfy Dods. He yearned
for another notice from the press. He rushed
away to the market, and bought a lot of kegs of
butter. Next day he male the press free to sample
the butter on the top of the bread. Talk or a
bivouac 1 Where all the men who professed to be
pressmen came from was a mystery, but after
ceasing to investigate that mystery, the still more
inscrutable mystery of where all the bread and
butter went to assaulted you. Reflection on these
two mysteries will occupy Mr. Dodds in his idle
hours for the balance of his natural life. He ad-
mits that ho has boon noticed by the press, and
that whether exhibitions come or go, ho will never
again put bread and butter in its road. Take.lt
easy, Dods. You got off safe, considering. Had it
been tripe 1
Major Smith—who after personal experi-
ence of the recent collision near Little River,
ought to know something about his subject—has
been holding forth at Ballarat, on the iniquities of
Victorian railway management. One of the worst
iniquities, in the eyes of the gallant Major, is the
engagement of Mr. Speight, as Chief Commissioner,
tor although “ it was true he had spent twenty
years of his life amongst railways, those years
were spent at home and not here.” Poor, Mr.
Speight, having been merely the manager of the
Midland Railway Company, couldn’t, according to
the Major's reasoning, be the right man to put at
the head of affairs in Victoria, where " colonial
experience ” was essential; but it’s needless to men-
tion that the eloquent warrior was able to put his
finger on the party for the position. Now, “colo-
nial experience,’’ in the particular matter of
Victorian railway travelling, has been so very un-
pleasant of late that the majority of our friends
across the border hailed Mr. Speight’s advent with
delight, and no sensible man thought of laying the
blame of the recent mishap at Little Kiver upon
the shoulders of a Commissioner who was only two
months in the colony. Mr. Speight has a heavy
task before him to sweep away the accumulated
evils of long years of jobbery and mismanagement,
but, unhappily, the very nature of his work will
ensure for him the bitter opposition of patriots,
to whom the very word “reform” is obnoxious.
Judging from malicious “pars.” in the Melbourne
press, and certain recent public utterances, the
new arrival needs to be blessed with a thick skin,
and a stout heart, indeed.
Some Victorian has been sending photo-
graphs of Dr. Moorhouse and Mr. James Service
to the Phrenological, Magazine, humbly ask-
ing for an opinion of their respective cranial
developments. And the Magazine (It’s awfully
nice of it) has published the result of its profes-
sional studies cf these two interesting subjects.
The Bishop, it appears, has been exceedingly well
oared for by Nature in the departments of bene-
volence, veneration, conscientiousness, hope, and
spirituality. Now, we’re not much impressed
with the originality of the Phrenological
Magazine in this description, because everyone
knows that all bishops are great in B., V., C., H.,
and 8.—it’s their business to excel in those matters.
If we had been Informed that the worthy divine
had a strong inclination to turf pursuits, or was a
professional pedestrian at heart, it wouldn’t have
looked quite so much like a “ cooked ” opinion.
But the description of the Hon. James Service is so
startling, yet so decided, that we feel impressed
with its goaulneness, despite our previously con-
ceived notions:—“ He is a man of great Intellect, as
sharp as a Toledo blade in his criticisms. .
His humour is a peculiar facultu, and enables him
to enjoy men’s company, as well as to turn them
to profit. ( Well, he's Scotch.) Not many men are
so well qualified to govern men. . . . He would
have made a humorous writer if he had given his
mind in that direction." Here, at last, we get a
glimpse of the genuine James, through the medium
of his bumps. hi 8 humour is a “ peculiar faculty ”
(so it is - peculiar in its modesty in always keeping
well In the background), and he’s “ well qualified
to govern men.’ r After that we won’t believe any
of the stories about Graham B. having “ a little
lamb ’’—they’re calumnious. We will readily be-
lieve, too, that James “ would have made a
£H. m 2 r S u ? wr * ter .” hut feel duly grateful that ho
didn t give his mind in that direction.” By the
wsy, though, no mention is made of the Hon.
gentleman’s roving disposition and love of travel—
the photograph couldn’t have brought out the
bump of all that properly.

George Thorne, junior, puts In his time for the
money. He has about three thousand agents under
him. (They are not included in the census any
more than the rabbits are, but they are there all
the aame, and equally active and pestiferous).
George sits in his office In Wellington, and keeps
the wires at work directing the movements of this
horde all over the colony. Their instructions are
to make tracks straight for the pockets of the
long-suffering colonists, and they obey them to
the letter. The department allows a commission
of 30s. per £100 for lives taken (quite a liberal pre-
mium tor murder, by the way), and of this the
super pockets 5s., the canvasser getting the balance
of 15s. When a new agent is put on the road,
George at once makes himself legally responsible
for soles for his boots; and when a few proposals
have been sent in and accepted, he is prepared to
buy a second-hand dickey and some paper collars,
to put him on an equal footing with the par-
son of the district. These advancements are
duly deducted from the canvasser’s commission.
Joseph Mackay, ex-canvasser, now on bail
for the alleged embezzlement of Government
moneys, has been unkind enough to publish
several of his late superintendent's telegrams.
This is one of them, addressed to Joseph :—
“ Wellington, 38/11/83. Urgent.—(Confidential.)—
Honorable Loader and Walters, Director and Man-
ager Victorian Mutual, aboard express train
Duuedin to-day spying with view starting N.Z.
Have few bankruptcy placards and others in all

judiciously. Tell them that Government Insur-
ance agents are thick as bees; hard enough for
them exist. Mutual agents starve, or worse;
sympathise and deprecate the unfair advantage
Government Insurance possess. They are
to be canvassed again in Dunedin by Ed-
monds.— Geokge Thorne, junior.” Now see
where the fun comes in. Joseph interviewed the
Honourable gentlemen mentioned in the above
telegram and was at once engaged a i a good man
to canvass Now Zealand for the company. Then
on a dispute arising between Mackay and his late
employers about commission—Joseph retaining
some monies in hand to pay himself—ho was
promptly arrested and safely lodged in gaol. But
this oold blooded adventurer took his revenge in
a particularly cruel manner on the estimable sub-
ject of this par. George Thorne, junr., was called
as a witness for the prosecution at the K. M. Court,
Geraldine, when the case came on for hearing, and
Joseph, who conducted his own defence, kept the
poor dear gentleman in the witness box with no-
thing to drink, day after day for nearly a week,
under the most terrible fire of cross-examination
ever witnessed in that Court. But he survived it
and had the satisfaction of seeing his unruly sub.
committed for trial.

comes on at the height of the London season, and
of course it will be necessary to give no admission
to the court without a ticket. Garmoyle has gone
to Greece, and the general opinion is, he might go
to Gehenna, and be no loss—It is seldom any one
rises to “forbid the banns,” still seldomer that the
person happens to be the bridegroom himself. In
a Lancashire church an old gentleman of 83, whose
name had just been announced rose to dispute the
point. The cause was simply that the lady had
ordered the banns to be announced without con-
sulting the old gentleman. As she had been nurs-
ing him, and he was rich, she thought It worth
while making a bold stroke.
An English lady states that by stopping
her cook’s perquisites she was saved £445 per
annum out of her housekeeping money, and has,
therefore, decided to raise cookie’s wages to £30
per annum. Generous creature I You would not,
however, have thought that a lady who has thou-
sands to lavish yearly on her household ex’s,
would have troubled about the grease, etc., her
servant sold to the rag and bottle-man. We sup-
pose her ladyship now sells the grease herself, and
that she is a good customer to those oriental

clothes, jewellery, umbrellas, babies’ clothing, and
every kind of property. Ladles and gentlemen

head of our red herring again. She'll cop it!
The red herring, that reminds us, is a viand quite
apart from all others. It has a dis’lnet indivi-
duality. It’s power is infinite. Perhaps there is
no man alive who could eat a whole red herring at
one sitting. But he doesn’t think so. As he takes
it out of its Tribune wrapping, fresh from the
shop, and looks into its expressive face, he loves it
and feels almost inclined to send over and get
trusted for another. Its expression is placid, and
there is that dreamy look about its eye which we
miss in the oyster. The oyster, when cooking, is i
the reverse of assertive, whereas when the girl
puts our military friend in the pan, he exhales
an odour sufficient to let the whole street know
that there is no expense spared in your
domestic arrangements. At first, when a man
begins on a red herring at breakfast—or say 7
o’clock dinner—he takes a large bito. Next time
he moderates it. Then he takes a smaller one still.
Next go he contents himself with holding his
bread-and-butter four inches above the centre of
his plate. Then he tells the girl to take the|damn
thing down to the bottom of the yard, and hastily
begins to gulp down his thirteenth cup.

[BY BAROM TENNYSON, &c. &c. &c.-“ on for ever.”]
[Our friend, Mr. Hugh K Liptus, has forwarded us
a note of exasperation sent to him, for us, by B.
Teqnyson. Thus the Baron, musingly:]—
0, would his name were aught but Brewn,
Or, being Brown, were aught but John!—
Ah! what a name to “ muse” upon !—
My Melpomene, do not frown.
I watch long nights in moated halls,
I mix my thoughts with milk and rum-
go mote the inspiration come;
But naught comes, save the lone cat-calls.
You say ’tis but a barren theme—
Cold-hearted, you would make a pun
Unworthy of a Tennyson,
And dear e’en at a “ crown" a ream.
But what care I for smile or frown ?
Oh Age’s breast my song will throb;
And, since I can’t sublet the job,
I’ll do my beat for old John Brown.
I’ve tried “ Descendant of De Bruce.”
Or “ Jcot who’d hae wi’ Wallace bled,”
Or “ Chiel o’ Freedom, highland bred,”—
I’ve tried them, but it ain’t no use.
The spiders spoil the cornice gilt,
The plush is hanging on the peg;
The whisky still lies in the keg,
Untouched, untossed, is the thrown kilt.
No more I’ll oil his ready hand,
Nor work with gold his rusty mind;
He had a soul above hia kind—
I saw his footprints on the sand.
I’ve got a ton of such-like stuff.
About as true—about as trite;
But still I’m crying for the light—
Though some might think me light enough.
0, cruel I hew my bosom bled
The Grand Old Man to give that gibe.
He said he’d tip some other scribe
To write his praise when he is dead.
My theme demands a lowly lay,
For one who draws his team, around—
Would we could have a “drink allround,”
And write the “ par.” another day!
Plant gilliflowers on his grave,
And wet them with the mountain dew;
I’ve blown my pipe till all is blue,
And here’s a “ bar ’ — let’s end the strain.
the Prisoner of Geelong.
I.
My ohln hangs down, but not with time,
Nor hangs it so
Through a villain’s blow,
As sometimes happens in our clime.
Mv nose is stopped, though not with cold,
But with the want of olden smells,
For it was wont to catch and hold
The whiff of breezy death that wells
From out the vat in which I had
The drink that seat the people mad.
My ears hang flabby down my neck.
Great flapping flags that tell of wreck.
And all these ills are on me cast
Because I held the grand old faith
Which teaches, whether life or death
You deal in. make your money fast.
We were seven. One, though, died.
And in a little, by his side,
Another threw his bones about.
And then another sliddered out,
Which left but four to fight the cause
O’ the grand old Faith against the laws—
Four fearless champions, bold and strong,
To fight the battle in Geelong.
Tt.
James Miller was the first that fell;
He kept the Olive Branch Hotel;
His was a heart that scorned the gains
Springing from Drudgery’s weary pains.
He looked aloft, he saw the stars,
Defied Oppression’s iron bars.
And, like Prometheus, rose on high,
And stole three stars from out the sky.
He bottled up, and each bright star
Shone from the bottle o’er the bar,
And men who tasted felt the flush
Of high, etherlal, godlike lush.
But as Prometheus on a rock
Was cast for having stol’n the fire,
So James, to satisfy the ire
Of law, was cast into the deck.
Eight guineas he was forced to pay
Unto the tyrants on that day.
in.
Then Mrs. Pinge, the loveliest soul
That ever stirred punch in a bowl,
Who also had the gift of Faith,
The grand old Faith that laughs at death.
And who the stars had been,
And stol’n a few, and brought them down,
And shook their lustre out, was seen
By the grim tyrants of our town;
Was taken by the ears, and she
Was made pay eight pounds-three, or “gee;
She did not “ gee," she paid the tin,
And hoofed It to the Phoenix Inn.
, xv.
Thus thinned we were, we four whose aim
Was but to keep th’ old Faith aflame,
tYhen William Brown came with a moan.
Whatever happened William, now
I cannot say, but he, somehow,
Slid out and left me there alone!
Mine was the strongest faith of all,
It rose to heaven among the stars,
It roamed the earth, and if my fall
Be sung of afterwards at bars.
Be sure you mind the hearty zest
With which I did my level best
To make you exquisitely blest!
My turn was practical, and I
Did not steal all down from the sky.
There’s an elexir sweeter far
Than found beyond the farthest star;
Than in the bowels of the earth,
Down, down, beside the very deuce,
And when men drink it, gad, there’s mirth—
It is tobacco juice!
Poor old Prometheus, T can say
I felt for him upon his rock.
When I looked round upon that day,
And saw myself within the dockl
For he was like me —he would not
Give in a peg or yield a jot
Of the grand faith that lifted him.
In my mind, to the seraphim.
And when my tyrants said to me,
“ You’ll have to fork out fifty pounds.”
I curled my lip and answered, “Zounds!
Seize, keep me in captivity!"
v.
And so they ran me in behind,
And days have passed and I am worn,
And allmy head and face are shorn,
And I am getting blind.
My chin hangs down, my nose is stopped,
I wish my long soft cars were lopped
Off at the base, they wobble sol
But still throughout my bitter woe,
As to Prometheus, so to me
The old faith shines still bright and strong,
And tells me thqt I yet will sett
A glorious triumph in ©belong.
He was so Clever.
There was a man who was so clever
That he seemed more than a mere mao:
His friends would say to him, “ You cun
Do anything, if you endeavour.”
But he was so extremely clever
That he could, somehow, fiever bring
His mind to stoop to anything—
All was too small for his endeavour.
Write ? He could write you rings round any
Or all the men you chose to name!
But he had no desire for fame —
He left that to the vulgar many.
Speak ? Why should he waste sound or sense ?
Your orators of onion-beds.
With waving tongues and bulbous heads,
They could supply your eloquence.
Your Reids, Buchanans, and such maulers
Of all the rules of rhetoric.
Your M’Blhones—it made him sick
To listen to such caterwaulem.
What he could do if he determined—
In law 1 Well, he would never boast,
But he’d somewhat surprise each ghost
Of jurisprudence, wlgged and ermined.
If you peaphanoe would say “ Some flashes
Of genius this man has,” his shorn
Long upper lip would curl in scorn,
And he would murmur “ Dust and ashes!”
Or should you say, as you might do,
“ Now, here’s a man with wit, I guess,”
He’d smile in utter weariness.
As though he pitied him and you.
The burden of his thought was ever
“ I pity the poor witless mass;”
And, as he looked into the glass,
“ I am so very, very clever!”
So he did nothing. Hawsoever,-
A man must live on something: he
Now lives on prison hominy.
Because ho forged a chequ* so clever.
A Lover’s Appeal.
You say we must part—that you never can love mo,
And can only esteem me a brother or friend;
That I am the last you could dream of as lover,
And that all that Is dearest between us must end.
But have you thought well on the woe this entails,
dear?
Of the tears, and the heartache I ever must know ?
Of days full of anguish and nights of repining,
And the clouds hanging dark o’er the way I must
go?
A bark without compass, I’ve roamed o’er Life’s
ocean.
Ever seeking an Isle I have seen in my dreams,
Where breezes of love on the mountains are blow-
ing,
And the flowers of Joy crowd the banks of the
streams.
Long years have I sought for this sweet Eldorado
Ever Hope’s gleaming pennant nailed high on the
mast,
Till now, o’er the waste of the lone, dreary waters,
Comes a fragrance that whispers, “ Fruition at
lastl”
I know I’m unworthy of such an Elysium,
But my bark fain would linger near yon precious
goal.
Oh, think of the darkness that soon must enshroud
me,
When the light of your love leaves the sky of my
soul I
Sav not I must leave you, to roam on for ever
Through the night and the storm where Hate’s
thunderbolt darts,
But let mo cast anchor in Shelter still near you,
E'er to bask in the fragrance your presence im-
parts.

Love’s Clasp.
Away! Unclasp thy waxen arms,
I cannot gaze upon thy charms.
Away! Envell thy star-like eyes
Where death in dazzling beautv lies,
Or outward launched, a upas dart.
With ruin blasts the gazer's heart.
Away I I dare not look on thee,
Or gazing, ever blinded be;
Those neotared lips I dread to press.
Thrice deadlier in their loveliness
Than Papua’s fruit of deepest gold,
Where venom lurks in every fold.
Away 1 Nor will I wind a tress
Though flowing in luxuriousness
It tempts the touch, a serpent-twine
I see in every ringlet shine—
As on thy brow, whose crystal white
Bxoels yon moon’s translucent light,
I mark a grisled spectre glare,
The death-fanged shadow of despair,
That warns
Away 1 thy arms unclasp,
Ay, rather crushed la python grasp
•"y tortured spirit I’d resign
Than feel that hateful clutch of thine.
Away! I cannot press thy lips.
Though buds in beauty they eclipse;
Ay, sweetly pouting reddening glow,
As rosy flowerets opening blow;
And tempt my soul that yearns for bliss—
But hold! Avaunt! I shun thy kiss.
As fatal yielded in thy clasp,
As barb of life-destroying asp—
Thou art too deadly-dear to me,
I dread thy love—yet worship thee!

“Knocked Out."
[A COLONIAL PICTURE.]
You see that “ cabby ” doling on his box.
Wearied of wistful waiting: for a fare;
His bat bears traces of some nasty knocks,
And “ cabby’s" coat is woefully threadbare;
His tangled locks look innocent of comb—
Yet, what a dash he used to cut “ at home I’*
In other times we knew the fellow well
(Those happy, golden days when all were young)
Tales of his escapades would toadies tell—
His praises by gay ballet nymphs were sung;
Adown Pall Mall he drove his four-in-hand—
That battered “ cabby ” slumbering on the stand.
The foremost figure of a fast-lived set—
Fair-weather comrades voted him, always,
The “ nicest follow that they’d ever met”—
Until, alas! he fell on evil days,
And Fortune—who Is ay* a fickle dame—
Frowned on her former pet, and— down ho came.
Then friends all vanished, like a summer cloud,
(How light is “ friendship ” in the balance
weighed!)
And “ cabby," who was sensitive and proud,
Asked for no pity and besought no aid;
But bore his troubles with a smiling face,
For men (like steeds) have pluck that “go the
pace.”
Like many another one, the seas he orost—
Hoping vain hopes, and scheming phamtom
schemes—
To find, afresh, the fortune he had lost:
With what result? Poor “cabby!” now he
dreams
Upon his box, sweet, mocking dreams, maybe,
Of youth, and “ home,” and what he used to be.
A sigh for “cabby.”-yes, one little sigh
Let pity find within your cynic’s breaat;
Don’t tell us that “He didn’t work, like I—
Was lazy, listless, worthless’’—and the rest;
But. many bettor men tomind recall,
who, once high up, were lauroa by sudden tall.

The Autophone!
The oriental cold company
have been appointed Australian Agents for
this, the Climax of Musical Invention. Call and
see them.
George Street,
Just Opposite the Entrance to the Markets.
The Autophone is a wonderful little instrument,
which, while It weighs less then three pounds, has
the lungs of a full-sized parlour organ, and exe-
cutes its muslo with absolute precision and perfect
effect.
It has twenty-two reeds, plays in three keys, and
all the parts of most difficult music.
On It a child can correctly play, without instruc-
tion, any of Its music, which at present consists of
over 300 selections from Hymns, Oratorios, Operas,
Waltzes, Polkas, Marches, Popular Songs, &c. It
is best adapted to the kind of music which suits an
organ best, in which chords predominate, but also
has wonderful power in executing very lively
pieces.
It Is pitched for the voice or orchestra, and has
a little card-holder for convenience in singing.
Any orchestral Instrument, Violin, Flute, &c., can
bo played to accompany the Autophone.
It is entirely well-adapted for Country Churches,
Sunday Schools, the Family Circle, and also for
Dancing.
The AUTOPHONE is like every other good thing,
the longer you have it the better you like it; and
as new music is being published every week, it has
an endless fund of amusement in it.
Price, 30s.

THE NEW TOWNSHIP.
Adjoining the Wallerawang Coal Company’s
Colliery,
Intersected by the Mudgee Railway 4 miles
n Wallerawang Junction.
from
In the Centre of the Richest Iron District In N.S. W.
SATURDAY, Sflth April, at 1 p.m.
WATKIN and WATKIN sell by auction, on
the Estate, as above,
1RONDADB.
So named because It is the centre of the most
favoured locality yet discovered in this
colony, so far as the proximity of the neces-
sary materials for Ironmaking are concerned,
viz' ORES, FUEL, and FLUX.
Hero within a radius of 4 o lies are found Iron
Ores of at least three varieties, Coal and Lime-
stone, all of which can bo won at a low cost.
The successful establishment of the Iron Indus-
try here will give N.S.W. the lead of other
Australian Colonies.
The Iron Industry has largely contributed to the
preeminence of (treat Hdrain over other nations;
and, to quote the Thunderer,
“ iron and Coal are*n their combination
the sinews oi industry and the
master key of trade.”
The Successful Establishment of the Iren and
Steel Industry in this Colony cannot much longer
be delayed, and the Auctioneers make bold to
aS80rt That that Successful Establishment
will be in the
IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD
of
IRONDALE,
Because, to repeat, nowhere else yet known in
N S. Wales are the materials necessary grouped.
Warned by the failures of the past, given suffi-
cient capital and competent skill, and success is
certain.
The Government, alive to the necessity of domi-
ciling the Iron and Steel Industry, have coiled for
tenders for
150,000 TONS STEEL RAILS.
The Coal Industry is already established in this
district.
The Colliery of the Wallernwang Coal Company
immediately adjoins
IRONDALE.
This Company secured the contract, some 50,000
tons, for locomotive purposes for the year 1884,
and are now satisfactorily delivering same.
The Lime Works, two miles from Irond&le, em-
ploy a large amount of labour.
So that altogether Irondalo bids fair to become
an industrial centre, such as New South Wales has
not before seen.
The Site is a particularly suitable one for a
Township, as will be seen after five minutes’ In-
spection.
■The Subdivision has been carefully planned by
Surveyor Weeks. Most of the streets are cleared;
in fact, it is a subdivision which vendors, sur
veyors, and auctioneers need not be afraid of hav-
ing criticised either before or after inspection.
WITH A VIEW to THE DEVELOPMENT of
healthy ATHLETIC SPORTS, the vendors have,
with a spirit of linerallty too rarely exhibited,
given no less than eight acres of the choicest part
as AN OVAL FOR RECREATION PURPOSES.
The Lots range up to areas of over 3 ACRES.
The TITLE is under TORRENS’S ACT.
The TERMS are-
£5 per lot deposit, If balance paid within 31 days
10 per cent, discount.
£5 per lot deposit, balance by 24 monthly pay-
ments, without interest.
Special Train leaves Redfern on Day of Sale.
Return tickets, 10s.
The auctioneers’ instructions are to sell, and the
public may rely on this—
THAT EVERY LOT PUT UP WILL BE SOLD
TO THE HIGHEST BIDDER.
IRONDALE, the NEW TOWNSHIP,
There is a very earnest Anglican parson
who rewards the best scholars In his Sunday-school
by taking them occasionally to the pit of a theatre
to see a good play. No, his name is not Macquarie
Cowper.
A gentleman has been writing from Beech-
worth (Vic.) upon the subject of “ Red Sky Sun-
sets.” In an awfully lucid and interesting letter
to the Melbourne D.T., he tells us that, “ having
occasion to be out at 5 a.m. on a recent morning
(gay dog, evidently), when in this clear mountain-
top atmosphere, with a silvery moon in the zenith,
there seemed every Incentive to a universal diffu-
sion eai'thwards of its mild whitish light, I ob-
served a most remarkable appearance. (Many of
us ‘see things’ at 5 a.m.—but no matter 1) This
was, that on the grassy slopes facing me to
the eastward there was a gorgeously red re-
flection as of the last rays of a setting
summer sun, when we commonly say it be-
tokens a hot day for the morrow. This aspect
continued till the usual yellowish dawn obliterated
it from my sight, but meanwhile my mental vision
had grasped more firmly (getting scber, appar-
ently) my previously formed idea that these red
sky sunsets and day dawns have not been ade-
quately explained by any ascertainable terrestrial
cause, but, as light takes time to travel, are the
natural precursors of the advent of a new lumin-
ary.” Now, that’s not bad, Just by way of a
commencement, is it ?—but it’s nothing compared
with the thrilling remarks about “equilibriums,”
“ vapour bedewed volcanic dust,” and other little
trifles which Immediately follow. Later on the
Beechworth mvant sets us in a perfect twitter of
excitement by saying: “And now I must come
to disclose my ‘ ideas as to at once the
possibility and the probability of this remarkable
red brilliance of our evening and morning sky
betokening the advent of a new luminary. Hither-
to, perhaps, scientific reasoners may have followed
my line of argument, and are, perhaps, preparing
to demolish it.” We don’t think that. The man
doesn’t breathe, in our opinion, who could demol-
ish such arguments, much less the “ideas” that
follow. Briefly stated, the “ideas” are these:-
“ England will not permanently hold Egypt and
the Soudan, but she must be paid for her expendi-
ture of blood and treasure. She may, therefore,
well stipulate, in abandoning her hold upon these
countries, for the cession to her by the Turkish
Government of the Holy Land, and throw it open
for the reception of 4 the dispersed of Israel.’ . .
They are to come eagerly, 4 like doves to their
windows,’ 4 their silver and their gold with
them.’” Then we have some rather mystify-
ing scriptural passages, which, according to the
Beechworth gentleman, mean that a “radiant
light beaming upon or over ” the Holy Land, will
attract all our Jewish friends thither in the course
of a tew weeks. He concludes by saying that
44 possibly our red sky sunsets herald the approach
of a literal light.” After carefully studying this
letter we feel certain that its 44 ideas” are solid,
and already we take a melancholy interest in every
Hebrew we meet, and in noting their striking re-
semblance to doves. Yes, we shall soon be losing
them. England (very likely) will throw open the
Holy Land to 44 the dispersed of Israel,” and they
(still more likely) will 41 take their silver and their
gold with them.”

Analysis has demonstrated the spirituous
element of Wolfe's Schnapps to be absolutely
pure, and the highest medical authority sanctions
its use in preference to any other preparation
where a stimulant is required.
No man of reflument uses inferior perfum-
ery, for the simple reason that no woman of refine-
ment would tolerate him if he did. In this country
the toilet outfit of a gentleman is considered in-
complete without a bottle of Murray and Bar-
man's Florida Water.
If this should meet the eye of any one
suffering from Bronchitis, Consumption, Asthma,
or any Pu monary Affection, we would refer them
to Dr. .layne’s Expectorant, which will, in all
cases, afford speedy relief, and in most, effect a
speedy cure. To be had of all Druggists and
Storekeepers, and wholesale by Elliott, Bros ,

Ayer’s Hair Vigor promotes the growth,
and improves the beanty of the hair. It imparts
an attractive appearance, a delightful and lasting
perfume. While it stimulates the roots, cleanses
the scalp, and adds elegance to luxuriance, its in-
gredients are harmless, and its effects are endur-
ing, and thus it proves itself to be at once the best
and cheapest article for toilet use.

Oh, so easy, is it not—
Easy as to lick poor Trlckett ?
Oh. so easy, is it not.
To bo a dramatic “ cricket ?”
Splendid life, you know it true,
You who’ve never writ a line—
When the players “ lay for you ”
Glorious, lovely, gorgeous timel
Push into the “show ” for naught
(Reads just like a fairy story);
Not a ticket to be bought,
Thunder I what a lot of glory.
We’re oppressed with all this—aye I—
Overwhelmed, Sirs, be it said,
Yet sometimes we moan and sigh.
Wish that all the pros, were dead!
Wish that all the pros, were dead,
Women, lowly women, even!
Won’t they swear when this is read,
But, yon know, they’ll go to heaven!
All those “boys ” with brazen pins,
Think themselves as “ big ” as Kahlo;
At the corner there’ll be grins—
Will all have a trump and halo.
“Silver King ” crowd, ev’ry one,
Will most certainly be winging
Their bold flights above the sun.
Hymns eternally be singing;
Flitting ’bovo the sky so blue,
Oughing psalms up ev’ry minute,
Why should they not all this do
When the parsons all are in it.

Mr. Tommy Hudson — who is a small
gentleman of infinite resource as well as of infinite
merriment (and, we may add—since it costs
nothing—humour, which, by the way, is a far
different thing I) started a show on Easter Monday
of a highly intellectual —and, we may say, invigo-
rating character. Mr. H. Santly is in charge of the
company, and he assures us that it is the most
moral troupe he ever travelled with. Ho has tried
all he could to be giddy, but the ladies of the com-
pany, though daily “ speechless,” are not to be led
astray. They won’t even answer invitations to
go to Bondi, and to little suppers, with mayonnaise
and “ fizz,” they turn equally a deaf ear. Harry
is, therefore, pensive, and wishes almost that he
had a troupe of Blondinelle minstrels.
* ♦ •
And this reminds us. Teddy M‘Clean is
going away in a week with a troupe of Blonde
Minstrels—ad ladies. We met him leaning against
a Jamp-post meditatively picking his teeth with a
belaying-pin. We timidly asked him why be
picked his teeth with a belaying-pin, and he ex-
Slained that in his early years, when he was more
eautiful (if possible) than he is at present, he was
brought up to the sea-faring. He still had a kind
of clinging to old associations; and all that was
left of them was the belaying-pin. So ho clung to
that [Tut, tut I-Bn. B.] We tried to urge him
not to take away a crowd of female minstrels,
but he would not be persuaded. We told
him about the last man who did it, and
what his fate was : —this was in the gleam—or

was Gibbons or more probably Gubbins. How-
ever, he opened here under the auspices of Young
Dutchy; when he had the classic academy of Music,
and after about a fortnight we went to see him
off He presented a singularly feeble spectacle ;
and h s language in the steerage of the “ Rodondo ”
was of such a nature as even to freeze the fore-
cabin steward. He had a kink in the back of his I
head, all the hair wrenched out, a"d only one side
of his moustache left. Several offers were made
by heart'ess members of the profession to shave the
balance off with hoop iron ; but he sadly but
courteously declined all the offers of embellish-
ment. He clung to it, he said. It was a memory 1
He wondered, vaguely, over a pannikin of rum
whether one of his company would come to see
hi n off. He had, he explained, always thought
well of them, and only for unforseen circum-
stances. . . . Just before the boat sailed two
of his company did came down. They brought
him a souvenir. We forget what it was now—but
we have a suspicion it was heavy. We consider,
on reflection, he thought so. But he didn’t speak.
That, however, wasn t his fault. He had many
faults—but that fault wasn’t his.

To return to Hudson’s Marionettes at the
old Masonic Hall, wo have only to speak of the
performance with unqualified approval. We have
borrowed this from Alfred. For obvious reasons,
this was all he would lend you. There is one special
feature in the performance that deserves mention
above all. It is this. There is a troupe of Minstrels
in this company; and there is something pheno-
menal about the troupe. They are all sober.
And there is a Pantomime—and a transformation
scene. “And the ushers are most attentive and
polite.”

It is only fair to state that the chief attrac-
tion of the show is a skeleton—that, as Santly puts
it, with his grim humour, or we put it-[We think
we put it. Bo. B.]—of the last proprietor of the
show. This skeleton is, we must add, the most
intelligent and agile we have ever known.
* * y
And we should be good authorities. For
we have known so many skeletons in our time.
We have belonged to an evening metropolitan
paper.

“ The Silver King ” is a real bonanza, not
only in name, but in reality -that is, for the man-
agers now presenting it at the Theatre Royal. We
dropped in on the evening of Easter Monday, just
to see how many men were left, after the day’s
slaughter at Randwick, with money enough in
their pockets and buoyancy enough in their
natures to pay for a ticket or two for this favourite
entertainment. Before the curtain went up on
the opening scene a shade of sombreness seemed
to rest upon the complexion of the audience Here
and there one could easily pick out a man who had
backed Martini-Henri against Le Grand. Even
the ladies looked gloomy, and when the fine or-
chestra struck up an overture it soundodliket.be
wail of alottcatin the Wilderness of Woe. But
when the curtain did go up it opened on a feene
particularly befitting the occasion-the private bar
of a London hotel on the evening of the Derby,
There was the usual compliment of bookmakers;
there was Wilfred Denver (Mr. G. 8. Titheradge), a
young married man of good connection, who had
staked and lost every shilling he had in tho world;
there were the men who congratulated each other
in having wrought their fellow’s ruin; there was
Henry Corkett (Mr. Hans Phillips), a young clerk
who had won more money than he ever saw be-
fore, drunk and dressed up and right on the
“shout;” and there was the thief, Elijah Coombe
Mr. A. Redwood), who relieved the young swell
of his money, broke his heart, and otherwise dis-
arranged his anatomy.
• • *
It fell to the lot of Corkett and Elijah to
enlighten the gloom, and they were not long in
setting the faces of the audience in a glow of
pleasure. By the way, if we remember our
ancient history aright, this is not the only scene
in which Elijah has assisted in enlightening the
gloom. Whether the Elijah of the Royal is the
Elijah of old, we have no accurate information.
He looks old enough, and villainous enough, to
borrow another man’s trap, saturate it with kero-
sene, set it on Are, and then gallop away to make
the owner believe the whole concern vanished in
flame. But if this is the original, ps we have
reason to suspect from his antiquated appearance,
we should like to know how he got back from the
red-hot ride he took over in Syria aotCf centuries
ago.
In the la«t scene of the second act we have
trio, Parkyn (Mr. Sefton), Sinks
i^=^ a ? i<5l8 k and Brownson (Mr. Leston). These
constitute the three (dls) graces We do
remember to have seen three such coml-
fools bunched together in one scene
seem to have been struck with
„ ® ® atn „ e club, and the only pity is that the blow
1 1 ratal. Binka has a nose long enough to
poke a dog out from under a table, and, as a
matter of course, he can't keen the far end of It
out of other pepple’s business. We don’t know
i ? re i., r- Daniels borrowed that nose, but it
looks like one that some old maid might have lost
at a recent tea-fight. We wouldn’t advise him to
tollow that nose through life. If he does, he will
have a very career. Mr. Parkyn has
o the drawl, all the bulk, but only
a little of the godliness of a parish clerk. He has
a very church-like appearance, which is accounted
tor easy enough, for there are two churches in
Jrarkyn s neighbourhood—one with a chimney, the
other with a steeple—and between the two Parkyn
is always in attendance at service. In fact, there
is a ruddy glow about his face and danger-signal
nose that says pretty conclusively that if the local
optionists went against his favourite place of
devotion, he would resign his holy office and move
out of the community.

We would like to know where Harry
Leston, the Tipsy Passenger, got that bundle and
stick. It is the same stick and the same bundle
we once saw an Irishman trudging along the road
with over in the mountains of America. To all
appearances it is the same Irishman, the same suit
ot clothes, the same hiccup, and the same old
drunk. If Harry didn’t appear so tipsy, he might
introduce a song with good affect, for he can sing.
He had lodgings next to ours down in Melbourne,
one time, and before he had been there a week,
there wasn’t a rat in the neighbourhood. If he
tad stayed a week or two longer, the chances
are that he would have been the sole inhabitant of
a once happy and populous suburb. The casting
of a good man for a weak part is one of the
strongest elements in the success which attends
1 1®. m , a^ a 8 - ement. In any other but Mr. Leston’s
skilful hands the part had better been left out,
but under his handling it becomes one of the most
laughable features of the play. The Publicans in
the vicinity of the Royal ought to club together
and present Harry with a gold watch and an illu-
minated address, for he looks so happy, so suggest-
ively jolly that when the curtain goes down on
him half the men in the audience go out and get
three-penceworth of the same stuff, and the other
half wonder what in thunder ever made them sign
the pledge.

Miss Melville (we are at the Minstrels now)
is a nice little actress, but she isn’t much of a
Girard.” It maybe that she can kick. Doubt-
less she does when she thinks of some of the
notices wo didn’t give her, and of some th >t the
other papers did. Perhaps, too, the loss of her
salary through the failure of a manager might
induce her to “kick” just a little; but wo don’t
believe that she will ever be supple enough to tie
herself into a bow-knot and then walk off on the
ends of her fingers.

Mr. H. Carroll, the man who burst up an
opera company by swallowing the leading soprano,
has not yet succeeded in coughing up the canary
birds she had in her pocket when she went down.
In this particular line, this artist is a success. All
he wants is proper pngelng and a leather b"ck t'
make him a second edition of Dickens’ Chr s mi a
Carroll. Although he has a base voice, we intend
to let him Carroll away as long as the genial Fred
Is willing to pay for it, and the public like it. We
should like to see him throw his soul into opera, and
then we would advise the management to take him
to China or to Alaska—any where that Is bard to get
away from. It is rumoured that the Girards got
most of their agility in trying to climb up <m some
of Carroll’s high notes. Wo shall enquire into
this after he gets back from the frozen north.
We’re in no hurry.

Horace Bent was evidently brought up in
the Yankee school of Oratory. There is a sus-
picion abroad that he once rubbed noses with a
coloured Methodist preacher. If he had a bottle
of whisky and a dog-eared Bible he would
be a whole nigger (a Tip-meeting, when Horace
was a boy his father told him that “as the
twig is Bent so shall it grow.” He tried it once,
and found it hurt less than a trunk strap. Since
that he’s been right on the “twig.” Ileauraont
Reid is singing better than ever; but while his
voice grows more robust his face grows thinner
Perhaps his voice is absorbing his flesh. He might
try the experiment of tying a string round his
neck and feeding his face for a while. The min-
strels are good the whole way through. The jokes
are mostly new, and the old ones have been worked
over so cleverly that the originators of them
wouldn’t recognise an ear-mark, nor even the
point of some of them. Happy public I ’Apny

The Opera House has been crowded every
night since the arrival of the Polks. As a comedy
“The Strategist ’ attains to a high order of merit,
and is fuller of free, rollicking humour than a
chair cushion stuffed with bumble bees. From the
minute the curtain goes up in the first act. Jack
( Rutledge Polks (!) fun at the audience, and in the
morning the janitor sweeps up a basketful of
buttons that were rudely burst from their moor-
ings. A lady told us confidentially, the other day,
that Mr. Polk had written his play in the interest
of the Anti-Corset Society ot Boston, U.S. She
declared that no woman would go to see it the
second time without letting out a reef in her lac-
ings. We don’t know whether this be true, but
we do know that a good, healthy pair of lungs and
a robust liver are bound to assert themselves when
“ The Strategist ” is on.
• » *
An outline of the plot was given in our
last issue Jack Rutledge (Mr. Polk) is in love
with Nellie Howard (Mrs. Polk), and the match is
mutually opposed by the parents on both sides.
As soon as this much has been told, you know, as
a matter of course, that the young people will
marry in due time. It always turns out that way
both on the stage and off it. But the happy event is
seldom brought aoout in such an ingenious way as
Jack adopts, that is, by a series of stragefic move-
ments that make the parents on either side howl-
ingly determined that the match shall come off as
a matter of revenge on each other. It has often
been said that true love never runs smoothly, but
with Jack and Nellie everything seems to have
been oiled up for the occasion. At last they run
away, just for the fun of the thing, and thus get
the best of the old folks all round by marrying
on the sly.
* * •
Of course, there is an Irishman in the
play, and his name is Terence O’Flam (Mr. Harry
Power), a direct descendant of the Kings of Oire-
land, who has a penchant for black-eyes, and the
heart of a dynamiter. He is a harmless-appearing
little fellow, and at first you don’t know whether
it'is an Irishman or a monkey you’re looking at;
but when his landlord hustles him out for non-
payment of his rent, it is then that the soul of Mr.
O’Flam begins to assert itself, and he turns out to
be a second edition of Donnybrook fair. We 'ike
Mr. O’FJam, but it would never do for him to play
such a part in tobacco-chewing America ; some-
body might expectorate on him and drown him.
Harry Emmet, as Major Howard, is hot and
peppery enough to season a Spanish dinner, did he
but look in the pot. Sergeant Grumbleton (Mr.
Edward Lest»r) is full of German eccentricities,
and is funny enough to be shot. The Rev. Mr.
Mildman (Mr. George Forbes), who collects for
the heathen, is a man who has never bitten off his
nose to spite his lace. The reason for this, pro-
bably, is that he would have to use a step-ladder
and a gang-plank in order to get at the end of it.

dldn 4 hit anybody on the noso. The
iho P h r80natior l' therefore, notwithstanding that
hon. member was loaded with theatrical “ fat,”
was pensively received by a pit that knew better.
His make-up was good, uowever; his own face
being carefully concealed behind a beard, and he
had a forehead on him that seemed to belong to
I>avld Buchanan. indeed, but for the idlosyncra-
cies we have mentioned, he might have passed in
an y public-house (say) for that learned and
talented gentleman. Mr. James Carden “Mem-
ber for Kooia, Premier of Leichardt’s land”
(well die of this great drama!), was really
impressive. If he failed in any point, it
was probably owing to his having been
born in Wappmg (he was born in Wapping).
and therefore being unable to form a cor-
rect o inception of what the Member for Kooya
and Premier of Leichhardt’s Land ought to do
with himself. Mr. P. Appleton was “Harddress
Barrington, an ex - officer in the Gmards, ”
and plsiyed the lover with a big moustache
(military reminiscences!) and an into leotual crease
down the front of his trousers. This is evidently
owing to a recollection, on Mr. Appleton's part, of
Mr. WoppiB a dresser. It remi ds him not to get I
his legs in profile.” And, alter all, creases are
less conspicuous than waters.
• ♦ •
The biggest hit was made by Maggie
Knight, who played the Premier’s daughter. She
was made love to by the ex-officer, who proposed
things (wo regret to say) of a “giddy” nature-
proposals which she repelled with scorn and a
hand that was dramatically pointed. Mr. D’Arcy
Stanfleid enacted Lord Adolphus Basset, and
seemed to labour under the delusion that no mem-
ber of the English aristocracy could be adequately
represented without a straw-coloured wig. Mr
Stanfleid gave up painting for acting, which is
a good thing. Wo mean it must be a good
thing to act a lord and say "ya-as” in
a straw-coloured wig I It must be. as the
Spaniard said—“ Very pieasaunt.” It we hadn t
got to write the paper wed bo doing this.no
doubt—or dancing on the tight rope. Wo wore
always gaily inclined. Mr. Ed win Palmer played
a mailman in a red vest, which gave him somehow
a dreamy resemblance to the Militia. “ Lady
Basset. Australian born,” was Miss Ethel Addle.
M'ss Addle is a charming young lady with a flue
set of teeth. Being “Australian born” the idea
prevalent in the minds of the puites was that she
would throw her shoe at somebody. Hut she
didn’t, and that rather militated against her po -
ularity. But still she was undeniably picturesque.
Miss Mars.on Leigh was an “adventuress,"and very
gorgeous she looked in some supero dresses. But
it struck us that she always adventured too much
and too quickly. Consequently every body could si e
from the start that she was going to be bowed
out. And this slacken* d the inten st. An adven-
turess ought not to too suddenly adventure. The
list one we knew told our fortune (always wrong)
weekly for half-a-crown a bang, and it took us
fully a year before we could give her six months.
She is now prospering greatly, we believe, in a
genteel sunurb, and is the proud possessor of a
“ house and lot ”— our own frenzied ambition.

To finish np—"Passion ” is a great play.
But it is rather too great lor our small imagina-
tions. Anyhow, dear public, patronise it. You
might like it. We mean that section of the public
that has a bulbous brain. We haven’t. We can
keep our brains in our shoe. And there is room
for them there; and for a small boating party.


PEPPER AND SALT.
"WELCOME, DR. BARRY!"
—Nooze.
Let loud rejoicings fill the land
From palace down to fish-shop,
The Evening News holds out its hand
To take that of a bishop!
Let Waterloo keep out of sight
Just now, its visage Gorgon,
While Alfred rigs a choker white
On its especial Organ.
Let those who down the harbour go
In snorting tugs and launches
(Men who have prospered here below,
If Truth’s in human paunches),
To meet a prelate, out of choice
To save our souls from hell, come.
Be radiant that the Nooze’r voice
Joins theirs in crying “ Welcome.”
Let those who prize far more than pearl
Or diamond, tales that shock eye
Or ear (such tale told Danby’s girl,
The now historic Cockeye),
Who lovo to learn that flesh is frail
And In Bin’s fingers plastic,
Hear Alfred’s cheerful “ Welcome 1" hail
The swell ecclesiastic.
Let those who read, 'mid tears and sighs,
His novels blood-congealing,
Feel glad that in the “ Brevities ”
He shows a kindly feeling
For one who may be useful yet
His heroines to marry
To those they love—real dukes, you bet—
And welcomes Dr. Barry.
Let those who think that Alfred’s pen
Ne'er runs In smooth or calm ways,
But deals In horrors wrought by men
And massacres on tramways;
Who judge his mission is to seize
All horrid themes, and dish up
For sale—feel good to note the ease
With which he greets the Bishop.
Let the great nows be cabled home,
And bo this paragraph road
From “ Brevities ” for years to come
The Bishop won from Alfred;
Let all the nations know who met
The Bishop—blest is hit lot—
Let Down and Gitjixrebs sell, and lot
[Let— up right here on tMs lot.—Bo. B.]

The New York Sun devotes considerable
spaoe to a description of the surgical operation
performed on Bruno Knorr in the Bellevue Hos-
pital. It seems Bruno was unfortunate in love,
and he shot himself on the 84th of last January.
The bullet entered the forehead, passed through
the brain, and lodged in the back of the head. He
was successfully operated upon, and the attendant
physicians are now of opinion that he will com-
pletely recover all his powers except that of
InteUeot. The case is supposed to be so exceptional
that arrangements are being made to have it
discussed before the New York Surgical Society.
Now that suggestion is wrong. But it might be
allowed to pass were it not that it Is accoompanied
by an opinion about tho subsequent mental
aberrations of tho patient. If Bruno is not a
member of a royal or noble family the prospect of
being an idiot for the rest of his life will prey
injuriously on his constitution. In consideration
of Bruno, then, it is advisable to draw attention
to a parallel case. From it Bruno will bo able
to learn that there exists a walk of life,
thoroughly respectable and independent, in which
It is possible for him to cut a distinguished figure.
To embraee it, it may be necessary for him to come
to Australia; but that will not be of much conse-
quence. Instead of giving .the in pur own
words, we shall let the gentleman, the subjeot of
the operation, tell tie tale In his own person. No
doubt, If Bruno be a reader of A’” - alian papers,
he will bo able to detect further .aenree of the
gentleman’s abilities. Here is his account:—
I was a happy youth one time and learned the
proud profession
Of draper in a country town, and here is my con-
fession :
It is a simple truthful tale of sorrow and of sad-
ness
That finished up tho other day with compensating
gladness.
A little accident befel that blighted my existence,
And left me on the world without a prospect of
subsistence.
But now I’m right, I’ve found my sphere, I laugh
who failed as draper,
For I have been appointed to write leaders in a
paper.
’Tis twenty years gone by to-day since on a sunny
morning
I took our gun into my hand, despite my mother’s
warning.
I thought my dad had emptied it upon tho night
preceding,
For he brought homo across his arm a duck all wet
and bleeding.
But I learn’d after, It came out in the succeeding
quarrel,
That dad had stol’n the duck and had not used our
single barrel.
I put the muzzle to my head, as they can tell who
knew me,
And then they took me off to bed and brought tho
doctor to me.
The doctor said tho slugs had gone right through
the brain, and settled
Down in my occiput, but cried, “The curious case
has nettled
“My skill, and I will operate, and use the best
devices
And as before he’ll be as wise and probably as nice
as.”
He drilled tho back part of my skull and got the
slugs so horrid,
And then put in a rubber tube that reached unto
my forehead.
This tube was perforated, and its object was to
swallow
Extraneous matter that might He within the sacred
hollow.
It swallowed, swallowed, for a month, at which
time he withdrew it.
And then looked in tho hole and ran two strands of
catgut through it.
My skull closed gradually round, with tho delight-
ful issue
That all the catgut was absorbed into a fibrous
tissue.
And so I rose In six months’ time from off my bed
and wended
Unto the draper’s shop to tend as I before had
tended.
But soon I found that rubber tube that I was won’t
to Hatter
Had taken all my brains away among th’ extrane-
ous matter.
The draper said, “Young man, got out, but don’t
think me a hard stick ;
You’ve really not a fitting head for tapellne or for
yardstick.”
And so from then I’ve wandered round and found
no work to suit me,
Tho man who’d give a job to-day would come next
day to boot me.
And I hare cursed that rubber tube till, though
my beard is brownish,
My eyebrows have grown white with rage and all
my features clownish.
I thought there was no work on earth to suit a
wretched hatter
Whose brains had all been taken out among ex-
traneous matter.
But, joy! the other week a man said to me, with-
out laughter,
“ Your eyebrows and your looks bespeak the genius
I am after.
“ Do, write a letter, write a few, ours is a leading
journal,
It circulates throughout the land and is a grand
diurnal.
“If you can catch our tone and style,” and here
his voice was solemn,
We will remunerate you at two pounds for ev’ry
column.”
I seized a pen and wrote away, and things at once
grew brighter,
He asked me down and fixed me up as special
leader writer.
And so the rubber tube I cursed, again I’m bound
to flatter
Because it took my brains away among th’ ex-
traneous matter.

The love which professional gentlemen
bear to one another may be fairly likened to that
which the devil is generally supposed to display
for a sprinkling of holy water. Not long since, a
pair of street nymphs had to toe the mark at tho
Melbourne City Court, charged with annexing a
couple of sovs. from a sportive youth, who earned
the money by compounding hash on board a mer-
chant vessel; .but as the evidence against the
annexorswas hardly conclusive, Mr. Call dismissed
the case, at the same time remarking that he had
no doubt but tho ladies had taken the cash. “ I
assure your Worship that they haven’t got it now,”
replied Mr. Daly, the solicitor for tho soiled doves.
And then tho genial Kane, a brother profefsional,
observed in a stage whisper, “No, I’m sure they
haven’t got it now; it has been collared by the
learned profession ; the first robber has left the
dock, the second has Just addressed the Court.’’
The Court smiled audibly, and, after remarking
“Bollencel” in a loud tone of voice, Sergeant
Macwhinney called the next case.

No greater benefactor to his species than a
certain Swedish professor has ever been born into
this world of trouble. This gentleman, a pro-
fessor in the University of Upsala, offers to freeze
any persons who may care to volunteer, depriving
them of all appearance of vitality, and bringing
them round again at the expiration of two years
without injury—" as they were," in fact.
A NEW IDEA.
Here’s a chance for a miserable “ chappie”
(Prince, publican, porter, or priest)
To lie down to rest and be happy,
For two years, or so, at the least.
’Tis a sleep (the Professor has stated)
Quite entirely free from all pain—
One is merely just refriger-a-ted.
Till his prospects look hopeful again.
Say a fellow’s gone wrong in tho city.
And contrived to get deeply in debt—
(Such things do occur—more’s the pity I)
There will be no occasion to fret;
If “ the wife ” drives him mad with her chatter,
Or the creditors worry and tease.
He can put a good face on the matter,
And make up his mind to a “ freeze.”
There he’ll He, in the refriger-a-tor.
Secure from all “ nagging ” and strife,
Till Death shall come—sooner or later—
To boar off his duns and his wife;
No troubles then left to oppress him—
Fairly out (so to speak) of the mire—
Tho Professor will take him and dress him.
And put him in front of the fire.

One more candidate for the top of fame’s
greasy pole. Mr. B. 8. Haines, of Richmond, Vic-
toria, has presented to the Government plans of
an apparatus whereby, when an enterprising dis-
trict likes, it can break up a drought without hav*
ing recourse to prayer or psalm-singing. Some
will be sorry to find the old industries superseded,
but most people will be glad if Haines can manage
to get his chin on the top of the pole. From bis
plans it would appear that tho first thing he wil
prepare will be a captive balloon. Into this cap-
tive balloon he will put 800 cubic feet of hydrogen
gas. In a cask hanging from the balloon he will
store away 501bs of dynamite. Then he will sit
down and wait for word to begin. Say they want
rain out at the tnallee. Mr. Haines takes his
apparatus out there, sends it up, contracts for a
stream of electricity to hit the cask at the right
time, and lo, the flood-gates of heaven are blown

the ultimate results of any invention, but the old
fashion of praying and psalm-singing as a means

that most people would like to give Haines a
chance—if he goes a good bit off and in among

Mr. James Service has been giving a little
fatherly advice to the youthful scholars of the
Castlemaine state schools, He believes (so he told
them) “ that a book was wanted in school to teach
manners. There were habits which were inclined
to grow on persons, but which were not desirable-
Children should bo taught what to follow, and
what to avoid. It looked bad to see boys, ten or
twelve years old, walking along the street smoking.
As he entered the hall he thought it had been
raining, but only a number of boys had been
spitting. In Canada he saw cards in schools asking
children not to spit.” Mr. Service forgets that in
Canada many of the little dears carry a little quid
of tobacco in their infant cheeks, and it’s on ac-
count of tho coloured expectorations being so
unsightly, that this pathetic appeal is posted about
the schoolrooms. That habit though doesn’t
appear to prevail at Castlemaine, or Mr. S. wouldn’t
have “thought it had been raining,” merely. Tho
thought occurs to us that these youngsters would
be Invaluable out Dubbo way, where prayers for
rain have been so plentiful. Only pack them off
fora half holiday to the droughty district, and
the visit would do just as much good as a six inch

Mrs. Langtry, who has been keeping us in
a hot and cold condition for months with rumours
and counter rumours (a sort of “first she would
and then she wouldn’t”), has never seriously enter-
tained the idea of visiting Australia at all—or so
it seems. The final announcement of her inten-
tions was a crushing blow to us, and a bad thing
for the “dailies,” who’ve been getting three or
four pars a week out of her, for months past.
First, Freddie Gebhard was going to take her
around; anon, her mother (who, by the bye
“ lives apart ” from the Lily’s papa), was to chape-

The schoolmasters of Victoria should have
spoken out in a body on the subject of the royal
bereavement. As it is, they left it to two mouth-
pieces, neither of whom, for what are called obvi-
ous reasons, can be taken as a representative.
One kicked the sympathic renadir with the toe of
his brogue and the other struck the sympathetic
zenith with his bald crown. Listen to the nadir-
man as he drives down his brogue : “ What is all
the fuss about? Leopold I Dead! Pooh! Wish
the whole family were dead!” Liston to the
zenith-man, as he climbs up with his bald head:
“ Oh, my dear young friends, the youngest son of
our august royal mother has been taken away
Such an affliction to us, such an affliction to Her
Majesty whom we in this colony unceasingly
adore! How can heaven be so cruel as to so smite
the heart of our royal mother ! Were there not
plenty of others, O God! to satisfy Thee if Thou
didst want to break a mother’s heart? Was I not
here ? were not these children here? How darest
Thou, then, stretch out Thy hand against our
royal mistress? Yes, I will say it with all rever-
ence, and I speak, I am sure, with the voice of
Victoria, Thou art nothing but” But why didn’t
the other masters say something? For obvious
reasons these two men are discredited. One of
these reasons is that both of them must have been
drunk.
“In Greek,” says Dr. Murray, the editor
of the Philological Society’s New English Diction-
ary, “the termination ikon never co-exists with
the privative a’—that is to say, the term ‘ agnostic
has been formed in violation of a rule in Greek
grammar. Now. whatever may be said as to the
Intellectual postition taken up by those who style
themselves ‘agnostics,’ it is a little unfortunate
that they should have selected a name whose
formation involves a grammatical blunder.” Now
this is real jam lor orthodox folks I Not knowing
how to answer the agnostic argument, they will
be able to elicit comfort from poking fun at the
ungrammatical “ ic ” in the agnostic appellation.
Although, says an English paper, of the
Queen’s book, the Queen has given the gillie
Brown a prominence which has excited almost
universal ridicule, notwithstanding that non-
courageous persons and papers carefully veil it;
yet there j 8 something to be said on the other
side. It is this : The noblemen around Her
Majesty, who are valets from choice, simply from
their own innate disposition towards toadyism,
never did anything to raise their functions in her
eyes or in those of the world. They have been
useless parasites drawing large salaries. But John
Brown, who was a valet from necessity, made him-
self really useful and worked hard at his peculiar
duties. He was trusted because ho was trust-
worthy, wanted no brevet of nobility, and did not
quarter himself and his relations on the British
a 7‘‘ r - This is true, for all the stupid rumours
about his dying worth a million are now dissipated.
A “dnowever rough he was, perhaps it would be
within truth to say that Brown was the most res-
Ptctatile favourite that a British monarch has yet
delighted to honour. In this view, the gillie
would be more worthy of his place in the book
than many of Her Majesty’s more aristocratic
valets. But poor though the book is in a literary
sense. It is even yet more disappointing in that it
contains absolutely nothing of the life of the
Sovereign as ruler of these realms, nothing of high
polities, nothing of impressions of men and events,
(except a tribute to Dr. Norman Macleod) no liter-
ary criticisms, little of the higher life at all, much
about taking tea, and too much about John
Brown, to whom the book is dedicated, and whose
virtues fill the final chapter. It Is eloquent about
little things, an over-turned carriage, the comedy
of a tea-kettle left behind at a pic-nlc, Brown s
frayed legs, and pages about “dear duchesses"
who were foolish old gossips. There is nothing in
the book whatever of high interest. It should be
called not “ Leaves,” but “ Leavings from a
journal.”
The other day, down in Melbourne, a con-
stable was summoned before the Chief Com-
missioner for a very grievous offence. A gentle-
man who was going home with his wife from a
performance at the Opera House, went into the
white Heart to get a drink, and to have his flask
refilled. He would not take his wife into tho
hotel, nor did he wish to leave her outside alone,
so he asked the constable on duty to take charge
of her. The guardian of the peace utilised the
opportunity by making Indecent proposals to her.
She complained to her husband, who took the
man’s number, and reported him on Monday. And
what was the result? Did the constable get six
months at hard labour, with three floggings of 25
lashes each, like many another poor devil whom
he had run in for a less offence, and had convicted
by his unsupported testimony ? Oh, no he didn’t.
He was fined £3, and told not to do so any more.
Verily the w.iys of the Lord are not the only ones
that are past finding out.
The Prince of Wales has paid a visit to the
London “slums,” made an appropriate little speech
on the subject in the House of Lords, and had
himself appointed to a place on the Royal Com-
mission to inquire into the condition of the outcast
poor of the great metropolis. This is undoubtedly
a sound stroke of diplomacy on the part of the
Heir Apparent, and one that may moreover pro-
duce really salutary results. For some time to
come, it will be quite “ the thing ” for the duchess
and countess to affect an interest in those “ dear
poor people,” and to put up their double eye-
glasses, affectionately, at the stage beggars in the
drama. That an epidemic of “ charity " Concerts,
and Fancy Fairs will do much to wards a permanent
amelioration in the condition of the poor wretches
—slowly starving, by thousands, in the courts and
alleys of the richest city in the world—is too much
to expect; still playing at philosophy” can do no
harm. An immediate result of the Prince’s pro-
menade through the “slums” will be an increase
in the incomes of the professional b; ggars who
have “beats” in the west end of London. They
make a pretty good thing of it at any time, but
now that such an august personage has “taken
up” poor people, the crossing-sweepers of Bel-
gravia and Mayfair will soon be in a position to
keep their carriage and pair. The sham charity
will be bestowed on the sham poor, and the genuine
“outcasts” will remain in much the same condi-
tion as usual.
Thus the Melbourne D.T. on a circus per-
formance “ The equestrian performances, to-
gether with thedro’leriesof the clowns, (oh, dear!)
combined to afloi-d a most enjoyable evening's
entertainment, and the feat of the lion-tamer was
received with a feeling almost akin to awe, but he
performed his perilous task with such marked
courage that the spectators, when he emerged 1
from the cage, gave enthusiastic evidence of their
appreciation ot this daring act.” We guess this
was the first circus the D.T. man had over attended i
for ho evidently fancies that lion-tamers. In tho
general way, stand in a corner of the cage and
tremble. Now, if he can discover any dyspeptlp

we’d like to go and see it. We don’t mean to
insinuate that there’s any particular “ catch ”
about throwing yourself promiscuously into the
society of a wild beast, however old and languid It
may be. Once, at Joe Beef’s notorious establish
ment at Montreal, we were inveigled into descend-
ing into a cellar, the private abode of a very old.
but very big, grizzly bear. The cellar was almoit
pitch dark, and we (there wore three of us) were
told to grope our way along in the gloom (in a
stooping posture, for the ceiling was low) and we
should find the bear at the far end, securely chained.
And when we found that the drunken manager
had pi yed a joke onus, and that the “grizzly”
was groping his way, without a chain, in our direc-
tion,—well, we retired.
Happy Jim, the jolly Salvationist of Bal-
larat, has gone to tho Beautiful River, Jim broke
more commandments in his time than any half-
dozen men in the South. There was a time when
breaking commandments was his hobby. Philo-
sophers know that there is no great mind without

was to burst up the Decalogue in a general sort of
way. But philosophers know that where the fad

Mr. Chenery, the late editor of the Times

Melbourne sausages—pork sausages—are

There’s somethin# in this notion of the
Northern Miner: —“The civil servant is a

when he puts his finger into every movement for
exclusiveness and selfishness; when the public
lntero8 f is sacrificed to private gain; then it is time
to give the civil servant tee ‘ rout.’ They get to
know too much about people’s business. In a
town not a thousand miles from Bowen a trader
was compelled to use cypher when telegraphing
to his branch in a neighbouring town. Why?
Because ordinary telegrams were communicated
to a rival in the trade, and he was undersold, his
prices being revealed. It is the secret correspond-
ence, the ‘tips’ given in trade: the revelations
made In the telegraph department; the wholesale
disregard of a sacred obligation to secrecy, that
do the mischief.”

Political Points
In Skye ’7,000 people are privileged to live
on the island by the will of 11 proprietors. That

i decency to allude to the fact as Illustrative of
the evils of landlordism. What next?
The English Social Democracy have now
an organ. Justice, which has a tolerably clear
voice. It counsels working men, when “locked-
out,” never to appeal to their Trade Unions for
support, or ask for out-door relief, but with one
accord, and in as many thousands as possible, to
throw themselves into the workhouses, “If this
were done,” says Justice, “as we beUeve it will
bo done in all parts of the country ere long, the

Henry George, writing from Glasgow
under date February 17, to a friend in Australia,
says :-*My trip here is, I believe, giving a great
impetus to the discussion. Against all difficulties
we are doing a work that cannot be undone. I
have spoken everywhere to large audiences, and
everywhere have carried them with me. 1 am
just returning from the Highlands and Skye. I
speak here to-morrow ; in Aberdeen on the 20th ;
and then in a number of other places. 1 want to
try to aret homo about the middle of April. There
is a great advance on this side since I was here
before, and every day it gains.
The vote for salaries to gaol chaplains is a
most objectionable one. The State might just as
well be called upon to pay the travelling expenses
of the relations and friends who visit prisoners.
The sects who boast of their missionary enterprise
might surely flad the needful for the remunera-
tion of gaol chaplains. The vote, as it stands, is
only justifiable on the hypothesis that the clerical
staff perform a considerable amount of work that
is absolute'y penal-and even then the spirit of the
ai?e is averse to torturing criminals!
One man gets up a lotteiy ‘on the art-
union principle” as a moans of deposing of houses,
lauds, mills, and what not, and is allowed to pull it
off, legislators even consenting to superintend the
“drawing;” and another fellow soils Californian
soap at a shilling a junk and gives a hidden trea-
suru in, and is hauled before the beak and fined £5,
in default three months; and yet there is no more
or no less swindle in the one case than the other.
Would Mr. Attorney-General or Mr. Minister of
Justice kindly explain why this is thus ?
In Rostov there is a society of child
mnrdereis, who poison children by means of
narcotics, on the principle that it is every woman’s
duty to spare the evils of life to as many children
as possible, and to make them share in the bliss of
heaven before the earth has contaminated their
souls. Not so foolish an idea after all when one
comes to reflect on the kind of life to which the
great majority ot Russians are born. Isn’t it Sims
who sings —
“Hath not a mother right to shield
Her children from the yawning hell.”
The re-construction of the Victorian Cabi-
net results in lighter work all round. There was a
neriod recently in which some unhappy Ministers
h id half-a-dozen departments to administer. Now,
Mr. Deakin is the only cue with three portfolios
hanging aoout his neck, while Messrs. Levien and
Gillies have two each. The two leaders have com©
to the prudent conclusion that one department
each is enough for them, if they are to keep their
hands ready for pommeling opponents. The
balance of the Cabinet have only on© portfolio
each, until we get to Mr. Thornley. who has none.
That’s the easiest of the lot, but then he gets no-
thing for it. And, likely, he’ll only give the value
of what he gets.
The Evening Alfred, in a singularly
fatuous article about the appointment of Loch to

Service’s last trick to get his name up
shows a bit of cunning. The cable had Intimated
that the French Senate would specify no Island
as a place to which to transport the unfortunate
recidivistes. Thereupon Jimmy wired to the
Agent-General to make it known “That nothing
would satisfy this colony but the removal from
the schedule of the Kecidivlstes Bill, now before
the French Senate, of all the islands in the
Western Pacific.” Why, Jimmy only thought of
this when he heard the Senate had made uo its
mind to do it. But his object is to keep dust still
in the eyes of the community, and to gull a part
of the people by making them believe that one
event, over which he had not a particle of in-
fluence, was brought about by the vigorous head
of “thiscolony.” If the French Senate changes
its mind again it will be* found that whatever the
i esult is, Jimmy will get away a telegram so close
on its neeis, and requiring Just so nearly what the
Senate has given, that it will want a patent chro-
nograph and a skilled expert to show that the
French Republic was not guided by him in the
passing of its Bill.
Messrs. Tucker and Langridge have been
away out Mallee-wards, emptying speeches and
bottles at a great rate. The speeches were
emptied from them, the bottles toward* them.
The people of Nnrajuha and Natlmuk rose splen-
didly to the occasion. People who can be
addressed as Naradjuhacks and Natimuckers,
demand, in the very nature of things, that
if language be slung at them, it must be done
chastely, elegantly, and recberchecally. It
was done that way. Besides the speeches,
however, these classic people wanted a railway.
This the Ministers deliberated upon to an accom-
paniment of flying corks. These ancient people,
although modernized to the extent of feeling the
want of a railway, were an courant with the pro-
per way to help Ministerial deliberation to a happy
issue. Therefore, the aforesaid accompaniment.
After playing it for a while, the Ministers and the
Natimukers and the Noradjuhicans were all of one
mind. The reporter who was present must have
been lifted up astride of the same note in the
musical stave, for he wired: “The Ministers pro-
raised to recommend the extension of the line
from Horsham via Natlmuk and Noradjuha to
Mr Gillies.” It would appear from this that Mr,
Gillies intends to take up his abode and lie out
there for the rest of his Hfe, so as to serve as a ter-
minus for Natimukand Noradjuha. To lie there
would be easy if he were only willing. But he is
not. To fulfil, therefore*, that promise of the
Ministers, it will be necessary to reach him at the
capital. It’s there only Mr. Gillies is willing to lie.
Queer as the people out there are, their line of
railway promises to bo queerer.
There was a man in the land of the US.,
and his name was John. He was a man who
had great power, even over kings and princes
(such as they were), and he was exceedingly
well liked by the “wurrukun” man as well.
And when the latter came to him and said, “Sire,
I am told there is an engineer’s billet open at the
railway, and lo ! thy servant is just the man to
fill it, for verily he knoweth no more about the
work than the bunyip does about Freemasonry ;
wilt thou give thy servant a Hoe to the superintend-
ent that he may secure the job?" His lord,
rising up, would write a few lines, seal the
envelope, and then, banding it to the son of toil,
would say ‘‘Friend, deliver that to the superin-
tendent and be will do unto you even as I would do
myself.” Then the poor man would lay hold of the
back of his head, and duck it forward as he kicked
out with his hind leg backward, and then he would
swiftly away, looking as happy as a Madagascar
monkey with a tin tall. But he never gottho billet.
And in like manner did he try for the tide-waiter’s
situation, for a p°st-office, for a water-works,
'turncock,” and last of all for a tram-guardship;
but although his friend always gave him the same
sealed letter of introduction which was to do the
trick still he most successfully failed to get a
single job. So he once more applied to bo
put on the rail, got the sealed letter
again and opened it. Then he read— *• January

founded idiot is bothering me again. Stall him

There is no likelihood of a general election f or the

influence anyway, but it's always best to keep on
the safe side. Choke him gently again in your own
felicitous way. Yours, truly .” That night

Messrs. R. Richardson, at dunes, and Smith and
Dr. Quick, at Ballarat, have started to run, ana
declare that they carry with them the programme
or the new Liberal party. They will not be left
a l°, n , e i n “*elr gallop. The customary black cloud
of kindred minds is likely to follow. And
*'Jo it win be several Englishmen of pith,
Sixteen called Richardson, nineteen named Smith.”
But, so far, the Issues raised by these new Liberals
are not very coherently put. The Hon. R. Rlchard-
son gave a full programme. Briefly stated, it in-
cludes (1) supreme control of lands by Govern-
(3) local option; (3) abolition of plural
v j 1' *1 establishment of courts of conciliation:
and (5) federation and annexation. What should
be done with the land is the world’s question at
the present time. But the new programme goes a
very short way towards its solution in simply
asserting that the land is to be taken back unebr
the control of the State. Expropriation is defen-
sibie. Local option, although in its essence a
Liberal idea, lies actually outside party lines, and,
like courts of conciliation, will only have efficacy
la as far as it is not a party question. Federation
and annexation, together with the millenlum, will
y come Id time, but the machinery where-
with the new Liberalism will expedite them is not c u
view in the South. The one item in the programme
around which Liberals can rally would seem,
iS9 r 9u 0re k® abolition ot plur 1 voting,
whether this could not be achieved without a new
party would be worth consideration, had not the
new party determined to get born whether they
were wanted or not. Major Smith makes this de-
termination very evident. The perfidy of Mr.
Berry, wedded to his own vanity, was bound, in
* , on idol of Ballarat, to produce a
Boiltlea! youngster strong enough to kick. And
*r. Quick is of the same opinion. And others ar®
hurrying up to say ditto. It is only fair to give
youngster his chance, but it must be confessed
that he has made his first appearance before the
public with very little baggage on his back.
Professor Alfred Wallace, the great di**
clple of Darwin, although in his work, TBh
Nationalization of Land, he seems to recommend
the same remedy for inequalities In social condi-
tions as Henry George insists upon, does not agree
with George’s radical and peremptory methods.
He Is represented by a Tory paper, to have de-
clared that he would “take ‘every opportunltv
to oppose what he considers to be ‘grossly unliiBt
in principle, highly injudicious in effect. and
altogetner illogical and inconsistent from Mr
£ e S rsr ?u S ?T n standpoint.' Mr . Wallace, in factl
holds that to tax rent is not to give land to the
people, but in many cases to Increase* the cruel
pressure of the monopoly.’ ” *

Mr.Fosberry says: “Theconductof thecon-

I constantly receive communications from country
benches, magistrates, and others, commending the
conduct and efficiency of the police; and it is
difficult to withstand the practise, which has be-
come inconveniently common, of presenting val-
uable testimonials to members of the force.” II
is presumed that after reading this information,
from a reliable source, those Impecunious scrib-
blers for the daily press, known as reporters, will
hide their heads in shame. All along they have
been declaring that when a policeman is wanted
he cannot be found: that when a row occurs, the
paid minion of the law scoots down a back alley,
and gets as f»r from the scene of action as possible;
that if an intoxicated man has any cash about him
the best thing be can do is to join a band of mags-
men for protection, as if he falls into the hands of
the police he will never hear of that money again;
that if a murder or robbery occurs, the best place
to look for a policeman is in the private parlour
of an out-of-the-way hotel, or outside the back
fence talking to the servant girl over the garden
wall. We are glad that Mr. Poseberry has come to
the rescue of the police in this official way, for we
have always looked upon them as a class of indi-
viduals who very much need rescuing at the hands
of somebody. And we quite agree with the In-
spector-General that “the practice, which has be-
come Inconveniently common (to hotel or •-

Tile New Victorian Governor is said to
■have been a favourite with the ladies of that
•colony in 1830. It’s nice to revisit the scenes of
one’s early triumphs.
When “ That Man ” was produced in New
York it scored a success, and the first night there
was the usual vociferous call of “author !”
Rising from a box seat, nervously untying a few
bonnet strings, and making a few hasty thrusts
after loose hairpins, the author stepped before the
curtain—a woman. Her name Is Celia Logan.
Mesdames Flanagan and Higgins sentenced
to death at Liverpool (Eng.) for the murder by
arsenical poisoning of Mrs. Higgins’ husband.
These good ladies made a practice of administering
solution of fiy-papor to relations and friends on
whoso lives they had effected insurances. The
precise number of murders committed by them
not accurately known.
Poor “Christianity ! ” It is brought in as a
plea tor every pious noodle's hobby. When it was
lately proposed that Oxford should allow women
to compete with under graduates in honour
Schools, Cannon Liddon objected “ because Christi-
anity taught us that woman was man’s helpmeet
and no 1 his rival.” The Canon, however, fired his
fossil cannon in vain, and Oxford declined to
make woman the slave of obsolete psendo-
Ohristianity.
The draft! of a BUI just prepared for the
English Parliament is the shortest on record.
After the usual preamble “be it enacted,” &c„
the wording is" 1. From and after the passing of
this Act no person shall be entitled to maintain an
action in respect of the breach of a promise to
marry; provided always that this shall not apply
to any action commenced before the passing of
this Act.” Nothing could be terser; mid we feel
sure Lord Garmoyle will vote for this excellent
Bill.
Says an exchange Mr. Barr-Smith, of
South Australia, has had an unlucky experience
of English life, i be other day he left his wife’s
jewellery, valued at £20,010, in a hansom. The
result is that, though he has advertised a re-
ward of £100 for its recovery, he has not yet re-
ceived any tidings of his missing property.” Serves
him jolly well right. By the time his wife removes
all the hair from his scalp and makes him sit on
the edge of the bed for a month of Sunday morn-
ings, sewing buttons on his shirt, he’ll probably
learn the value of a spouse and will look after her
things a little more earefully. We suspect that
the cab driver considers himself the luckiest man
on earth Bar-Smith, bar no body.
A woman’s dress is always deseribable. Its
numerous changes, its vast expansiveness, the
dubious uncertainty as to what it contains, de-
mand the compliment of a description. To
report a man's appearance when he is in
full dress is something adjacent to a super-
fluity. But oecasionally a dress suit arises on the
field of vision which is interesting psr se. Such a
one has been the envy of its owner's companions
lately. The trousers were a dream. The coat was
a miracle. But the actual resplendence of the
outfit lay in the waistcoat. There was not very
much of it, either. It was an impressionist waist-
coat, and the greater part of it had been scooped
away, leaving a shield-shaped expanse of linen as
broad and shining as a poet’s summer’s sea. No
dude could look on it and live—happy.
“Marie Burroughs, the newest American
actress, will make a sensation before she
dies. Half Nev York is talking of her
beauty, and, though the youngest aciress
at her theatre, sue takes the honors from
two of the most popular women on the
stage. All the dudes (including young Flake and
Gebbardt) and regulation first-nighters were there,
and sat through the whole performance without
once going out to see a man between the acts.
They remained to gaze at Burroughs. The theory
has been advanced that Burrou rbs is not intrinsi-
cally beautiful, but that the charm of her presence
is entirely due to graceful carriage ana superb
eyes. An accurate description of her lace would
not give any one the impression that she is a beau-
ful woman. Her real name is Lillie Arrington.”
A Timaru (N.Z.) correspondent writes
“ Tight lacing is spoiling the shape and squeezing
the life out of our girls,” and “their maternal
guardians seem rather to encourage it than other-
wise.” This is a sad commentary on the gallantry
of the young men of Timaru. In Sydney the girls
don’t have to resort to tight-lacing. Every last
one of ’em can get squoze into any shape she
wants by the strong right arm of her best young
man. Apropos is the dialogue said to have occur-
red in the Garden of Eden : “Do you know dear,”
said Adam, “ whv my arm is like a spring in a
great desert?” Eve : “No.’’ “Well I’ll tell you
dear. ’Cause it makes glad the waist places.”
Eve: “Do you know, i dam, why your arm needs
medical attention?” “No.” “Well I'll tell you
dear. ’Cause its out of place.” [This dialogue
may not have occurred in the Garden of Eden,
but there is a raoss-cnvered scent about it that I
savors of antiquity. Ed. B ] |
Not long ago the London World described I
a new invention for making ladies taller. Jt eon- j
state of a very ilght-Sttlng «or8et, shoes wblgtotadj
with 50B). each, and a ring endirblmg the waisv
suspended from the ceiling at such a height as to
prevent the febt from touching the floor. Tho
weight at the reet pUlls the lower portion of the
body downward, while the corset forces the upper
portion upwards. By this means, It is asserted,
the spinal column may he stretched 2in., and the
hnee joints Bin., thus giving to the body an addi-
tional height of 3iln. Simpkims, wnose wife —a
very short woman—asked him for mon?y enough
to fit up one of these machines in her boudoir, re-
plied: “My dear, what you women want is not a
contrivance to make your bodies taller, some
sort of an arrangement that will drive your
tongues up and make them shorter.” Then, as he
dodged the potato-masher and slid Into the bath-
room, he heard someone hissing after him—
“ Beaste-e!”
In the Spectator of December 15 appeared
a review of a novel from Miss Jay’s pen, entitled
“Through the Stage Door,” containing the follow-
ing strictures:—” This is a regrettable book. The
coarse vices of bad men are not material whereof
women should weave their fictions . . . Ex-
ceedingly repulsive features of a novel which has
no attractive ones. . . . The very vulgar
company of this novel is, however, preferable
to Its tine company. . . The Fane family aie
not at all original, we have met them in
many trashy novels. . . ‘It will readily be
understood,’ says Miss Jay,‘that on reading the
above authoritative condemnation from a quarter
I so much respected, I at once assumed sackcloth
and ashes, spent a distressing Christmas, and re-
solved never again to write a theatrical novel.
Imagine my surprise, therefore, when, on opening
the Spectator, a morning or two afterwards, I
read a second review of ‘Through the Stage
Door,’ containing the eulogy which follows:—
‘ We are inclined to think that this Is the best, as
It is certainly the pleasantest, story that Miss Jay
has yet given to the world. . . . The effect of
the book generally is good, and Its tone sound and
wholesome.’ ”
THE HUSBAND’S LAST REQUEST.
A POEM.
“ Dearest Mary, T am sinking, I am sinking very
fast,
My pulse, dear girl, beats slower every day;
And It’s better so, I m thinking, for the longer I
may last.
The longer doctor's bill you’ll have to pay:
Thus the little bit of money that my prudence has
amassed
Is shrinking (like as I am) right away.
“ Yes, dear Mary, I am going, I am going very
soon,
No mortal skill can save me from my fate.
And there's something nice in knowing, dvar, that
ere another moon.
I probably shall try the “ future state
A change which I shall welcome as a blessing and
a boon:
It can’t be worse than this, at any rate.
But, enough of melancholy, Mary, never look so
sad.
For wives lo -e husbands better when they're
gone.
And a widow’s cap looks jolly, and a widow s
gown’s not bad,
And widows, dear, are seldom left forlorn.
You are young, and you'll have offers in a month
or two, begad,
’Tis folly, idle folly, dear, to mourn,
“Yet, you’ll sometimes think of hubby when an-
other one you wed—
You’ll sometimes think of hubby “number one,”
When your cheeks again are chubby, and your
eyes no longer red.
You’ll not forget me, though my course be run;
But will praise me to the “second,” like—or, so
I've heard it said—
All widows, since the flood, have ever done.
“In some cosy woodland corner let my mortal
part be laid,
Where the sparrows overhead their vigils keep,
Let dog, Ponto, be my mourner-he’ll be pining,
I’m afraid,
When he finds his poor old master is asleep—
And (I beg, my dearest Mary, that my wishes be
obeyed)
Give ordei s that the grave be dry and deep.
“ Let a handsome iron railing, dear, encompass me
aiound—
’Tis always best to have one, I am told
(Alas, my breath Is falling I) it keeps stragglers off
the ground,
Who love to walk on people when they’re cold.
In the matter of the railings, don't be careful to a
pound—
But have them nicely done in blue apd gold.
“Now, you won’t forget, dear Mary, the instruc-
tions you’ve received
Respecting ho I wish to lie at rest.
And you needn’t fret, dear Mary, for, unless I’m
much deceived,
Before the grass can grow above my breast
A “second” you’ll be taking, and—if books may
be believed—
A sscond husband always treats you best.”
When the term “fast” is applied to an
Englishwoman, it may mean she is the very op-
posite of prudish, or even of prudent, but it does
not follow she mu ti be therefore immoral. It is
simply a matter of external manners, generally
rather mannish ones. She will be independent and
very self-possessed, *tj ll<h, “ Hlrtish ” perhaps, but
with little leminine refinement as a rule. t>he
always uses slang, often smokes, and sometimes
shows her s cokings. It would not be fair to an-
ply the appellative to the Princess nf Wales, for
although—despite her cold dignity in public—she
Is genial and free in private, jet she is always
ladylike. She has been known to wear dresses as
decolletee as any one; but that is a matter
which from a feminine point of view is utterly and ■
entirely separate 'jom morals. Where one woman
sees gpotfaer in an open bodiee, the
question is no % whether it is proper to show so
much, hut “ Is It worth showing ?” It’s a great
mistake to suppose in this respect that one woman
is ever shocked at another’s want of propriety: if
she’s displeased at all, it’s at her want of taste in
exposing a poor bust, or because she’s terribly
Jealous of her good one. And considering that
ier good mother, the Queeu, insists tuat modest
young girls shall always make their first appear-
ance before her, even on the coldest winter day,
with nearly half their bodies entirely nuae, ex-
posed to the gaze of hundreds of criticising eyes
(for the rule is unalterable that a girl cannot be
presented at court except in a low bodiee) —
considering this, it is natural to suppose
that the Princess of Wales and her friends
got accustomed to show, and t<> see, a good
deal of one another at an early stage of their
maidenhood. But the Princess Louise is de-
cidedly fast. She talks unblushingly with men on
subjects which are usually supposed to come ex-
clusively within the masculine province of dis-
cussion, and can appreciate the point of a joke
whose recital would have delighted Dean Swilt, or
would make some other women’s hair stand on
end. She has always a hearty laugh whenever
she tells the story how, on returning from her
honeymoon, she telegraphed to the Queen, at
Windsor, “The Campbells are coming,” and how
her motaer absurdly supposed it was a delicate
announcement of an interesting character. “It
was too utterly silly of mother, she always ends
up; “ why, we were hardly a month married.” It
Is whispered she smokes since coming from Canada,
and she is certainly a judge of wine, and won’t
drink any but the very best. She never hesitates
to show, not only her feet (which are better out of
sight considering their size),but a considerable por-
tion of the stockings above.them whenever occasion
offers; and what is more excusable, for she has one
of the prettiest necks in the world, her evening
dresses are about us decolletie as a maucomd wish.
And, touching once more ou this delicate question
of undress, wo can’t help repeating what Gladys
Countess of Lonsdale once said about it—yes, and
to a man, too. He happened at dinner to make a
chance remark upon some other lady, when the
“gipsy beauty ” looked him fairly in the face and
said: " I know there are lots of women who say I
wear my gowns too low, but they should remem-
ber it is not far their benefit I do it, at all events.”
This lady is wonderfully pretty, and travels often
with no one but her maid us escort. Perhaps the
envy of less favoured women may account for
some of the naughty stories told about her; yet
she does sail “ pretty close to the wind.” Lady
Augusta Fane is her great friend—a daughter of
the Countess of Stradbroke, whose pur about the
Earl of Lonsdale has just get Edmund
Yates three months’ imprisonment — and
quite as rapid as the “ gipsy, ” both of
whom regard husbands as sometimes a
convenience, and sometimes a bore. Lady Seb-
right is undoubtedly fast. She is an amateur
actress of the most character, and thinks
nothing of sending to dashing young gentlemen
such telegrams as these: “I am Pauline to-morrow
night at Windsor; come and be my Claude;” or
“ Will you be my Romeo for a couele of nights ?”
There are many other women noted In their seta,
but who are not famous beyond. The Chamber-
laine belle seemed merging in the set of “fast
ones” onoe, but recently she has disappeared As
for Mrs. Cornwallis-West, her husband stands by
her, and he has position enough to assist him in
slurring over the things she does. But her tawdry
style and painted cheeks are getting too pnn*de
now to attract the attention they used. Mrs.
Wheeler no one ever so much as hears of now.
These women,however,unlike the others, got their
start of notoriety by their intimacy with the Prince
of Wales. When he dropped them, so did every
one else. They have been dropping themselves
over since.

FROM THE BULLETIN.
Seer of the new great dawn! whose strong voice
rings
Across drear wastes of life, where Life grows
pale.
And calls “Ansel” to wan-cheeked men that
wail
Beneath the iron feet of men—made kings—
Speak I and shed light as from an angel’s wings
Upon a world where Mammon is the Baal
That claims man-sacrifices, held entail
By tyrants damned, like to him who clings
With frantic fingers to a wavering hop©
Of yet more empire—him, the shuddering Pope,
Who rules with fear the hearts he fears, and
cowers
In secret cells from all the blades that grope
To find his heart, while sympathetic powers
Hail as Heaven’s wreath, Hell’s crown of polsour
flowers.
Speak! till the ghastly faces, wet with tears,
That lift to hear thee, from the footworn ways
Of pain and want, grow manlike in the rays
Of Hepe upburning from the atoning years
Thou bringest message of—when earth’s fair ears
Which God’s large hand of ample bounty lays
For mankind’s feast, no more shall mock their
gaze.
Speak! till each glutted king and priest who hears
Shall tremble, knowing that the hour is come
When they that knelt before him, blind and
dumb,
May see the morning-glow of Truth afar
Lit up by him who seeks to raze the sum
Of wrongs and sufferings that warp and mar
This life—who comes, a Chrlst-like guiding star!

which were : Forbes, 140 ; Grenfell, 06.

In Melbourne, the Mines Department de-

we have some first-class men scattered through the

Still another “ champion ” wrestler has
arrived in New York. Hans Kink, the champion
wrestler of Switzerland, arrived in New York on
February 37. Ho was born in Basle City. Switzer-
land, in November, 1857. He stands Oft. lln. in
height, and weighs 15st. 10K>. Ho has won ovu
fifty matches in Switzerland, and is well up in ail
branches of wrestling.
Before playing a game of four-handed
euchre with a vouug lady from the back blocks as
his “ pardner,” a knowing Sydneyite told her that
every time she held the joker it was a sure sign
her “Joker” was thinking of her. Then, when
the fiend watched her face during the progress of
the game, and saw the peach bloom rise to her
cheek, ho made a pretty shrewd guess as to where
the joker was.
Still another champion has turned up in
Melbourne. Mr. Lovelace claims to be champion
bicyclist of Australia, as he defeated all-comers
between the years 1870 and 1876. It Is a wonder
u r Lovelace still lives to write of his wondrous
performances, considering the bone-rattlers that
were ridden in his day; but should what ho slates
be true, the prefix of ex should figure netore the
title claimed by him. _ _

and when the card was called over on Wednesday,
18 to 1 was offered; and on Thursday night, when
only four dogs wore left In the stak»>, 4 to 1 was
taken and offered. For the deciding course, 9 to 4
was laid on Mineral Water beating Greentlck. Last
year’s winner was quoted at 100 to 1 on the night
of the draw: but Wild Mint wns a rank outsider,
and won by the greatest of flukes.
The Parkes J C. races extended over no
less than three days. On the opening day, the 8th
April, Examiner won the Malden Plate ; Biddy
won the Ladies’ Bracelet; Orphan Boy carried off
the Town Plate; and Pinkie, the Flying Handicap.
The second day opened with the Shorts Handicap,
won by Junius; Victory was all there In the
Prince of Wales’ Stakes : Student made an easy
win of the Jockey Club Handicap; and Harlequin
won the Consolation Stakes. The concluding day s
snort consisted of the Farewell Handicap and
Shorts Handicap, which were won by Barney and
Reg ulus respectively.
Ivo Bligh does not think very highly of
our Ted Evans, judging by his account of the
match against New South Wales, he says “ Our
opponents’ list included the far-famel Evans,
whose name has been so often impressed upon us
at home as that of the best all-round man in Aus-
tralia—a title to which, at the present time, he is
most certainly in no way entitled. Indeed, we
rather question whether he would find a place now
in their best eleven. Magnificent fieldsman though
he undoubtedly is. his batting nowersseem to have
almost deserted him, and his bowling is hardly up
to the high standard of excellence in that strongest
of bowling elevens.”
Says a Yankee exchange:—“Hosmer, the
Bost< n oarsman, says he has had enough of walk-
ing matches, and that he will now go off to the
country to fatten up for the rowing season.
Hosmer says he will be ready for any man in
America, bar Hanlan. He thinks either Hamm or
Conley can beat Teomer, although the latter is a
good one. If Hosmer’s walking matches have not
injui ed his rowing abilities, he will make it hot for
any oarsman except Wallace Ross, George Lee,
'idwardjHf’nffin, and John Teemer, and they are
Just a class ahead of him, although at three miles
he might succeed in beating anyone but Hanlan or
Teemer.”
About the most leary crowd it has been
our lot to witness together for some time past,
under the guidance of a “captain” who owns
several ocean going steamers running between
the aristocratic suburb of Pyrmont and Lime-
street wharf, “got left,” to use a Yankee phrase,
at the boat race on Saturday. The leary ones
waited In a launch round Uhr’s Point, and as the
boats passed them joined in the procession, but
before reaching One Man Wharf they ran on a
reef, and the subsequent proceedings interested
them no more. The Commodore people gave
them a “chivvy” as they passed, but the Captain
and his “boys” hadn’t the civility to respond.
A correspondent has asked us if we can tell
him anything of William Sheriff alias Prussian,
who is one of the candidates for the pugilistic
championship of the world. Sheriff was born in
England, in August 1847; his height is 5 ft. 5im.,
and weight list. 2 lb. He first entered the ring in
1857, beating J. Barrow, of Leicester, in 15 rounds,
occupying one hour. A year later he defeated
J. Marshall in 30 minutes. In 1860 he defeated
Fred. Orton, of Leicester, in 35 minutes. In 1861
he met George Orton, the police interfering after
the fight had gone on for three hours. He did not
appear in the ring again until eleven years later,
in 1873, when he fought another member of the
Orton family—Jack. Sheriff won easily in 35
minutes. Six years later, in 1878, he undertook to
beat Badger Brown in 30 minutes, but the autho-
rities prevented the fight. He next fought Denny
Harrington The constabulary interfered after
the fight had been in progress ;43 minutes. After
much wrangling, the stakes were awarded to
Sheriff, Harrington declining a second meeting.
The sawdust worriers are making a big
struggle to work up the agony in the States.
Vaughan has accepted our William Edwards’
I challenge for £200 a side, and In all probability
Harrlman and Dan O'Leary will chip in and make
it a sweepstakes, By the way, we see the N.Y.
Spirit of tue Times holds a deposit of £50 from
Vaughan in reply to Edwards’ challenge. The
Spirit does not devote a line to even boxing
matches with gloves on account of the alleged
brutality of the sport. In our opinion, a bout
under Queensberry rules cannot hold a candle to
the prolonged strain of a six days’ contest, so far
as a brutal exhibition is concerned. Edward
Hanlan received £100 out of the plunder of the
last Yankee go-as-you-please, which was won by
Fitzgerald.
Says an American paper“ I was not
surprised when Bogardus informed me that he
was going to England to meet the many English
wing-shots, because I think there is more money
in England at the game than in this country.
Dr. Carver is also going at the same time. It will
not amaze me much to see Carver and Bogy an-
nounced to shoot for a large stake after they
Invade Albion. Of course the match will hesult
according to the betting. I do not believe there is
any spirting man who could, with safety, back
Bogardus to beat Carver, or shift the cut and put
up money for Corner to beat Bogardus. Both are
on the make, and it is the betting which in nine
cases out of ten decides the matches they engage
la against {each other, not the merits of the con-
testants.”
The Hon. Ivo Bligh, before leaving Mel-
bourne, threw off a few oracular remarks about
the prospects of the “ fourth Australian Eleven.”
The Hon. Ivo thinks that the present team is
altogether stronger than any of the previous
oues, and (says the Melbourne Herald) “an
opinion like this, coming from so sound an au-
thority, is very gratifying.” Without reflection in
auv way upon Ivo’s judgment, we may be per-
mitted to remark that the fact of a ufun being
skilful at cricket doesn’t make him “a sound
authority” on the game by any means. The average
jockey is usually one of the very worst judges in
the world of a race ; the profestloaal oar man
delights in discovering Invisible excellencies In the
wrong crew; while the ordinary “hactor” can
never see the good points of a popular per-
former. No, the “public” is the soundest au-
hority we know of.
London Bell’s Life says:—“ Many com-
plaints having been made during the past season
in America with regard to certain competitors at
regattas being systematically blocked by others,
with a view to securing the victory of some par-
ticular sculler or crew, the matter is at present re-
ceiving the attention of several prominent mem-
bers of the committee of the National Association
of American oarsmen. It is stated that at the next
meeting of this body a new rule will be added to
the existing code, giving umpires and regatta com-
mittees power in case a sculler or crew is wilfully
impeded by others in a trial heat to allow such
scullers or crews to take part either in a supple-
mentary or the final heat ” Such a rule would
not be amiss in the colonies either, for it is not so
long ago that a man was wilfully, or what appeared
wilfully, fouled in the final heat of a race, which
foul allowed a third or fourth rater to annex the
prize.
Reggy Bloxsome, who now Uvea at
Ranger’s Valley, near Glen Innes, has been trying
his hand on the turf at Inverell, but so far has
not turned up trumps. Reggy thought to scoop
the pool with a grey named Trumpeter, but the
brute ran a good last in no than three races. It is
rumoured that a local undertaker, Thorley is in
treaty for the steed, and, should he succeed in
obtaining the fiery mustang, Trumpeter wiil be
painted black and given a trial to see whether he
is fast enough for a funeral procession. Cecil
Bloxsome, a brother of Reggy’s and another
howling swell, drove into the recent picnic races
in a dilapidated trap, to which were attached four
untamed steeds, and raised the envy of the
Invercllites by tho manner he performed on a
trumpet which, like tho trap, had seen better
days. He drove out of town the next morning
and had a very narrow escape of being “ run in
as no one but a milkman is allowed;to blow a horn
going in or out of a town-at least, so says a local
trap.
It is rumoured that one of the very fore-
most jockeys is to be warned off the tnrf when
the first opportunity offers. It is not Archer; and
the Spouting and Dramatic News adds: “ It is
assuredly not Cannon; Fordham is out of tho
question; it is not little Martin nor 8. Loates, and
Osborne cannot be meant.” “ All this,” says the
English correspondent of the Spirit of the
Times, is merely a round-about way of naming
Charles Wood. He it is, of course, and h‘s license
to ride has been renewed only with a severe cau-
tion to him to take heed to his ways. Whether
Wood will ‘ stay ’ through the year remains to be
seen. I know that an illustrated paper proposed
to give coloured portraits, this year, of four lead-
ing jockeys, and the question of choice bad to bo
considered. Archer came first, as having headed
the list of winning riders for a dozen years. Wood
was passed over, as it was considered by no means
certain that he would be In active service a few
months hence, and the others are therefore to be
Cannon, Fordham, and Osborne.’*
Hilaria Balsau, the young Frenchman who
wanted to swim the whirlpool rapids of Niagara
last summer after Captain Webb met his death,
but who was prevented by the authorities, has
turned up at Montreal. He says he intends to at-
tempt the perilous task as soon as warm weather
sets in The mistake made by Captain Webb, in
Falsau's opinion, was in trying to swim through
the Immense waves of the rapids. When making
the attempt, Balsan says he will keep close to the
Canadian shore, and on reaching the rapids will
allow himself to float along the surface. Ho ex-
pects to come to the surface to breath once every
minute. In less than five minutes he will be
through the whirlpool; therefore If he could
come to the surface five times in the passage he
would be safe Balsau is working in a leather
factory and says he has influential friends in
Canada, who assure him that ho will ba allowed to
attempt the perilous task without hindrance. If
they do, it will bo the best proof in the world that
they want to rid themselves of him,
Tom Cannon, won the Sandown Grand
Prize (Handicap Hurdle Kace) al the Sandown
Park Club First Spring Meeting, with the Amerl-
rlcan-bred horse, Sachem, by war Dance, out of
Si v Boots. Tom Cannon has, so far, won two races
with Sachem. The American-bred horse ran ten
times as a three-year old in England without once
passing the judge first. In 1883 he was beaten six
times in succession, and then, after a dead heat
aad the disqualification of his opponent, managed
t> credit his owner with the Brighton Autumn
Handicap. Me acquired the evil reputation of
being a soft or ungenerous horse, although that
such censure was fully deserved may b< 1 "ibted.
As a rule he ran consistently enough, alt on
uno occasion last year, in the Koyal Hunt Cup, he
did not appear to be on his best behaviour.
As a hurdle racer Sachem promises to take high
rank, the victory at Sandown on Wednesday hav-
ing been a very hollow one indeed. Probably
rachom is the first American-bred horse that has
wonareailylmportaat “Jumping” race in England.
For the past three years females have had
it all their own way with the English Waterloo
Cup, through Princess Dagmar, Snowfllght, and
Wild Mint, but this year’s winner. Mineral Water,
is a dog by Memento-Braeroum. For the deciding
course, between Mineral Water and Greentlek, theT
dogs had scarcely left the slips when it was seen !
that Mineral Water was left behind pretty well a 1
length. They had, however, gone but a few strides
when he raced past and came on to move his garr 9
four lengths In front, then, shooting forward on
the line, he ran up a sequence of four strong
drives before pussy broke from him, when, bowk
ever, he quickly replaced ‘himself for two othey
drives, and then sent the hare round to Greentlck,
who scored twice and lost his place as the hare
broke away. The white at once dashed clear
away, but pussy whipped from him, when Green-
tick shot up on the inside, and again used his game
twice, when the hare again shot away clear.
Mineral Water exhibited superior speed, and
knocked his game about three times before
serving Greentlck for a single effort, after which
the favourite shot out, wrenched and killed—a
very easy winner.
At Jem Mace’s show at Leicester (Eng.), on
January 31, one of the attractions was Captain
Charles H. Austin, the champion rifle shot, who,
among many feats, attempted to split a potato
placed on the head of his wife. This feat was suc-
cessfully performed fromtthe ordinary shooting
position, when the Captain placed himself in a
lying position across a chair. Breathless silence
prevailed, but immediately after the shot Mrs.
Austin uttered a scream. Blood flowed profusely
from the head, and Austin immediately seized his
wife and carried her to the retiring-room. As
might be expected, the utmost possible excitement
prevailed; but, fortunately, a doctor happened to
be a spectator, and his services were of the utmost
importance. Austin stated that his wife made a
slight movement simultaneously upon his pulling
the trigger, and that he knew some injury had
been incurred. The doctor, in describing the in-
jury, said that the ball struck the scalp on the left
side of the head, making a wound about three
inches in length. After a short interval, Smith, of
Baltimore, better known as “ Smith of Liverpool,”
had a set-to with the veteran Mace, but they could
not shake off the damp the accident had cast over
the audience.
Another of the periodical outcries against
“gambling clubs” is just now resounding through
London society, and the proprietor of a small
baccarat hell, in Park Lane, has been mulcted In a
very heavy sum. People possessing a grain of
sense smile, of course, at the notion or this Isolated
prosecution doing anything towards curing an
evil so deeply rooted as high play. The “warmest"
clubs in London are quite neyond the jurisdiction
of a police court; the Turf, for instance—where
the Prince of Wales is almost a nightly visitor
when in town—is notorious for the heavy stakes
won and lost within its sacred precincts. Besides,
if gambling were abolished, some of the best known
among the “ fast set ” of the English aristocracy
1 would be in the position of our old friend Othello
—their occupation would be gone. More than one
heavy swell with a “handle”—and a good “han-
dle,” too—to his name, is known to have devoted
many an hour to acquiring (in some sung little
private room) certain sleights of hand from a man
who is clever with the “ broads,” and to have paid
handsomely for the tuition. Several prominent
patrons of the turf would have come to grief long
since but for their ability to (quoting a sly remark
sometimes heard In the “ ring ” when their lord-
ships have had a bad day) “ get it back at dealing
after dinner.”
The citizens of Wanamie, U.S., recently
went in for a little gentle sport in the shape of a
bucking match between two worthies named
Evans and McOauly. The contest was a desperate
one, lasting 25 rounds, and it is thought one of the
combatants, Evans, will not recover from the
effects of injuries received. Both men went into
training some time ago, and on the moraing when
they faced each other, weighed 210 lbs. each. Both
men were possessed of big heads, and built In
In the first round Evans bucked
teOauly in the stomach, and threw him over the
ropes. A foul was claimed by McCauIy’s friends,
as he said ho struck him below the belt. The foul
was refused. In the next round both men bucked
their heads together, and the report was so loud
that it was thought by the spectators their heads
were broken. They were not hurt much, how-
ever, and the fight went on. In the Eleventh
round Evans had his nose broken by a terrific
blow from the head of McOauly, and in the
fifteenth round McOauly had five teeth broken in
his mouth by a similar collision. In the twentv-
flfth round both men came together with such
great force as to send them back reeling. Evans
was knocked down insensible and was unable to
come to the scratch. His scull is fractured, and
he is not expected to live. McOauly is not in a
much better condition. Thousands of dollars
changed hands on the result. Brutes 1
Charley Mitchell, the English pugilist, has
returned to the Stites, a bigger and stronger man.
He weighed nearly 13st. when he left England, and
stated he would try for anothershot with Sullivan,
with or without the mittens. Sullivan continues
as big a blackguard as ever. According to an
American paper, he attended the dinner given to
Hanlan, Lee, and Cotsford, at Victoria (B.C.)
Sullivan had been imbibing freely. He told one
gentleman to ‘ dry up or ne would make him,”
and continued to exhibit his amiable proclivities
until his remarks became so offensive that the
chairman requested him to islt down or leave.
He chose the latter alternative, and saying he
could wipe out the whole crowd and other
like expressions, finally left the room. While at
the table he drank three bottles of champagne in
quick succession out of a beer glass. Slade has
left the champion’s troupe. The pair were on bad
terms for some time, and on February 23, the night
of parting, had an open row in a drinking saloon.
Sullivan, it seems, was considerably the worse for
liquor, and after butting Slade in the face he was
seized by the latter, thrown to the floor, and held
there till the arrival of a policeman, who had been
sent for, and who put Sullivan in a hack and gent
him to the Palace Hotel. Sully, who until his
elevation to the championship, thought such
vanities as collars and cuffs beneath him, now
dresses a perfect “ dude,” even going to the extent
of yellow gloves, upon his ham-llke “mashers,”
with which be recently put to sleep a lumberman
named Lang, in seven seconds, the shortest time
on record.
The N.Y. Spikit of the Times gives a
vastly different account from some of the other
Yankee papers with regard to the alleged perfor-
mance at Boston, of Mr. F. P. Murray, the Ameri-
can amateur walker, who was reported to have
done a mile at the winter games of the Union
Athletic Club of that city in 6mln, 2i%sec. It ap-
pears that when turning the corners at the upper
end of the track “ he assisted himself by taking
hold of the supporting posts,” in other words he
swung himself round by their aid. It also tran-
spires, according to the Spirit of the Times, that
the centre of the floor is an asphalt parallelogram,
at whose comers are four huge posts. Around
this is a board floor 31ft. in width. On this board
floor the surveyor laid out a path whose four
straight side* were 13ft. tin. from the outer edge
of the board, or 17ft. 6in. outside the asphalt, and
whose four corners were quarter-circles turned on
a radius of 33ft. The path thus laid out was 754 2-
7ft in circuit—an exact seventh of a mile, and this
was the path to which the surveyor certified. In-
stead of laying out this as surveyed, and placing a
curb eighteen Inches inside its measured line, as
was directed by the surveyor, the managers of the
building made no curb, but used for that purpose
the edges and corners of the asphalt floor, thus
making all portions of the actual path many feet
Inside the surveyed and certified track. The re-
sult It that, roughly estimated, the path is seventy-
five feet short on each lap,'or over five hundred
fe»t short on each mile. This will also nullify the
record of Meyers, who, at the same meeting and
on the same track was alleged to have run three-
seventh’s of a mile in Imin. 89)4sec.

IRISH ILLUSIONS.
[The following article is from the pen of
our late Theological Editor. This statement needs
some explanation. Briefly then, there have been
so many now brands of liquor introduced to the
colonies of late years, and the public mind has ex-
panded so much in consequence, that, in order to
Keep our place In the van of the march of intellect,
we were obliged to engage an Editor of Theology.
This department was formerly conducted by the
gentleman who edits the mixed drinks when our
admirers call upon us, but these had increased so
largely and the mental vision of the editor himself
had become so kaleidoscopic that we had te
transfer the theological portion of his duties to a
calmer and less promiscuous Intellect. The gentle-
man wo engaged was recommended to us as a
person of the highest order of ability and of stain-
less moral character. This latter quality at once
secured him the unanimous derision of the other
members of our staff, but we took no heed of this.
We were determined that we should have at least
one contributor to our columns who would write
Of religious matters with some personal prejudice
towards purity of conduct, and an acquaintance,
however slight, with a few of the common virtues
such as truth and temperance. The late Irish
gala-day suggested several things to us, and we
looked around among the members of our literary
staff for a man to write us the article we wanted.
We required something cool and rational, yet to
the point, written by an Irishman if possible, yet
having none of that celtic Are and fury which so
frequently repel people of other nationalities when
reading anything about Irish affairs written by an
Irishman. Our new Theological Editor seemed
the best man we could select. He was an Irishman,
but a philosophical one, and able to take a cosmo-
politan view of the affairs of his country. We
Erint the article as he wrote it. We may state
ere that he left our staff shortly after. Chief
Editor B.]

There is a superstition very popular among
some classes of Irishmen to the effect that God
created Ireland. This notion, absurd as it appears
to the English mind, has taken such a Arm hold
upon them that even writs of ejection are power-
less to drive it out. We may call this the flrst
Irish illusion. The second Is that God created
Ireland for the Irish. These two Illusions, with
some others—all of which are innate, whatever
Locke says—are the cause of most of the troubles
that have afflicted this unhappy because unphllo-
sophioal people from the earliest period of their
history. We are aware that a great many writers,
who are considered authorities on the question,
have ascribed the troubles to other causes, such as
poverty, priestcraft, landlordism and so forth, but
this view must be wrong as these evils have not
always existed; but Ireland has always been in
trouble. Plainly, then the source of all Irish
misery must be sought in the Irish nature. Surely
the whole world knows all about It I Has it not
been analysed in novels and pictured in plays ever
since before we can remember ? Do wo not
know the reckless, free-hearted, Pat equally ready
at repartee with his tongue or his stick, and never
so crushed with misfortune as to be unable to
make a joke or dance a jig 7 This interesting but
impossible creature is the generally accepted
type of an Irishman. He is another illusion.
And, curious enough, Irishmen themselves are
the most taken in by him. As a matter of fact
the Celtic temperament is wild and melancholy.
The old Irish songs are a proof of this. They are
in almost every instance mournful and dark of
thought. Even the fun—wherever there is fun-
is grotesque. And grotesqueness is the humour
of gloom. The Irish wit is like the phosphores-
cence that plays upon the water when the
night la darkest and the storm is rising. And
the truly typical Irishman does not wear his
heart, in his sleeve any more than he wears his pipe
In his hat. He is frank and free-spoken, certainly,
but not a bit more so than is good for him. After
ho tells you, as you think, everything, he has a
sufficient reserve left to guard himself and defeat
t /our plans in case you should try to use the infor-
mation he gave you to his disadvantage. If the
Irishman is anything he Is a master of subtlety.
His generositv, however, is pure, and may be
allowed to him without any qualification, except
perhaps caprice. He is undoubtedly kind-hearted
—and very kind to his own kindness. These are
the qualities that make him miserable. He is
melancholy by nature and this in Itself is enough
to make him a discontented being under any cir-
cumstances. Then his circumstances happen to be
poor which, of course, intensifies his discontent.
His generosity is gall to him because he cannot be
generous in the manner he would like. His suspicion
and reserve make him consider every foreigner his
foe. So, after seven centuries of continued effort
for the welfare of Ireland, the English Government
is as much disliked by Irishmen now as ever it
was. What caa you do with such people ? How
can any government settle their difficulties 7 The
policy of settlement by starvation is no doubt the
best plan that the rulers of Ireland have hit upon
as yet, inasmuch as when there is nothing left in
the country to eat, there will be little loft to
quarrel about. But it is slow, and the people have
in some miraculous fashion so adapted themselves
to it that they seem to be able either to d > alto-
gether without food or to live upon what nobody
ever suspected to be fit for food before. Perhaps
they live upon recollection. And speaking of re-
collection, another Irish illusion is, that Ireland,
like the landlady whom we have met, has “seen
better days.” This is simply a nursery »ale. There
was a time when there were no potatoes in Ireland
—ay, and a time when there was only a very poor
prophecy of Kinahan I There were certainly
more kings and chiefs and bards than there are
now. but we doubt if the people at large bad
much more to eat on that account. Think of the
flrst race who came to Ireland after the flood
—the Partholian, we mean. When they landed,
the country was bare ; the air was un-
disturbed by a sound save the roar of ,
the waves dashing on the stormy . coast;
the land looked a loady and forgotten land. And
so it was. These were no fairs there then, no
flghts, no wakes, no whiskey. With dark pre-
sentiments the Partholanl got out of their trough-
shaped ships and went ashore. They did not find
even a dead crow in the whole Island. And as the
more nutritious class of vegetation had not had
time to come to the surface, they had to mine for
it. The traces of these mining operations are
scattered all over the country at the present day.
But the roots soon played out, and the Partholanl
gradually ate each other out of existence. There
is not a relic of them now, not as much as the
material for a toothpick. This is one of the Irish
golden ages that patriots and poets are fond of
regretting. There can be no doubt, to a calm and
philosophical mind, that the most peaceful period
of Irish history was the time when Ireland was
uninhabited.
♦ ♦ *
Irishmen are the prey of illusions. Another
of these, and perhaps the most popular among
them, is that they are by nature the cleverest
people in the world. This makes them all the
wilder when they think of being oppressed by a
race intellectually inferior to themselves. Here,
in the colonies—to take an illustration nearer
home—you will see that when Irishmen get into
political life they usually say more and do less
than politicians of any other nationality. The
writer is an Irishman himself, so ho cannot be
accused of prejudice in making this statement.
To give Irishmen their due, they are quicker in
emergencies and more elastic by nature than either
Scotchmen or Englishmen, but they have not a
tithe of Scotch Judgment, or a twentieth part of
English solidity and tenacity of purpose. They
will not like to hear this, but we are telling the
calm and solemn truth. It is a poor thing if a
writer in this philosophical age cannot deal with a
subject without being biassed by his nationality,
* * *
here the theological editor went out for ten
minutes with a friend.
* * *
Of course another cause of Irish trouble is
Irish pugnacity. There will hardly ever bo much
peace in a country where men foam at the mouth
on seeing a piece of green or orange ribbon. Until
this miserable faction-feeling is stamped out, there
will be little hope of happier times in Ireland We
who live in a free and (so to speak) enlightened
atmosphere can afford to smile at such barbarous
folly, but it is no matter for smiling to those who
live in the midst of it. The only real cure for it
is to educate the people. Education has done
wonders hero in the colonies. It has made the
rising generation tolerant of all creed,sand believers
in none. To the calm eye of the educated man the
antics of Orangemen and Papists, with their im-
mortal memories of Lfcnerick and Benburb, Lon-
donderry and the Boyne, are alike paltry and
ridiculous.
* * *
At this point the Theological Editor went
out with another friend.
• • •
There is no stability in anything that any-
one should become enthusiastic over. Tho rhyth-
mic roll of the waves of history, the choral march
of the ethnic procession across the earth, like
shadows chasing shadows across a field of poppied
corn, are seen and heard by the Thinker only in
the solemn watches of the night. These are the
hours when the voices of Time shiver in small
sopranos upon the mysterious background of the
awful major motive in the fathomless fugue of
Eternity.
* * *
Here the Theological Editor went out again
by himself.
• ■ •
After all, whatever may bo said against
the Irish, it must be admitted by even their worst
enemies that they are the cleverest people now
living on the face of the earth. The Scotchman
may have some poor virtues—what else could you
expeot from a poor soil 7—such as thrift and per-
severance, but he has no judgment to bo compared
with that of the Irishman. As for the Englishman,
ho has certainly some good mulish qualities, but
in solidity of intellect and Indomitable will ho is im-
measurably inferior to the Irishman. That this
statement Is not the outcome of prejudice may be
seen by studying political life in this very colony.
Who so ready to jjjan, so vigorous to execute, as
tho Irishman ? Who so frank and free and light-
hearted as the Irishman 7 And how is it that a
race so full of noble qualities as the Irish has been
so long poverty-stricken and miserable ? Plainly
on account of evil Government. We wish to apeak
moderately on the matter, having no belief la furi-
ous declamation, but we certainly think the time has
arrived when tho English nation should take some
steps to lighten the burden of poverty and misery
under which the patient and peaceable people of
Ireland have groaned so long. As far as the latter
themselves are concerned in their own manumis-
sion, we would advise quiet and constitutional
measures. Any other are unsound and unphilo-
sophloal.
• •
Here one of the most dissolute members of
our staff dropped in and the theological editor
went out with him also. Both returned in about
half an hour, the dissolute villain smiling.
* * *
What is the cause of the troubles in
Ireland? The base and bloody Saxon who has
danced for seven centuries on the body of a bleed-
ing people. What is the remedy 7 Fire and
blood. Rise and tear down the gory oppressor.
All talk of peaceful measures is puerile palaver.
We are proud to say we are Irish, and we are
proud to sly those are our sentiments. Rise O,
down-trodden people 1 Forty patriarchs look down
from tho Pyramids upon you. Strike till you
bring the brutal Saxon to his knee and make him
render up again to you your birthright. Let
‘‘every man his own Banshee” be your watch-
. word. This is the keystone of true liberty. Trample
‘upon the bigoted Orangeman. Remember
Aughrlml Remember the Broken Treaty 1 Down
with the tyrants I Rip out the good old chorus :—
The White Oockade has come to town,
To pull the Orange and tho Purple down;
And over the water we shall wade
To follow the laddie with the white cockade 1
I’ll sell my rocket, and I’ll sell my reel,
And so will I my spinning-wheel.
And over the water we shall wade
To follow the laddie with the White Cockade!
Whoopi Gore!

[At this juncture we came in and found
our Editor of Theology fighting with tho manacle-
keeper. Glorious thing, isn’t it,to run a paper? We
had him—the editor—tied, and sent homo in a
covered cart. And now we have a vacancy for
another Religious editor. We are not weak and
wild enough to expect the next one we get to he
sober, but we do expect him to confine himself to
one kind of liquor when ho is writing a philo-
sophical article. No man who has a moral charac-
ter—unless it is a particularly hldlous one—need
apply for the situation. We have had enough of
piety; what we want now is vice—haggard, un-
blushing vice.—Ohikf Editor B.]

A fruit soiree was advertised. It is not a
common event, like a tram-hash or the mobbing
of a Chinaman, which we can revel in at any time;
and we hanker for novelties; so we went. The
place was quite full, mostly with ladles. The
soiree was got up by the Congregational Debating
8 )Oiety in the Bourke-street Schoolroom, with the
object;, we understood, of rubbing off a debt. A
very excellent idea; though our personal experi-
ence of attempts to accomplish any such feat has
not been encouraging. We don’t indulge in
chimeras now. The hall was nicely dressed, also
the ladles; and one glance at the packed audience
all simmering with sympathy and anticipa-
tion showed that the Bourke-street girls are
very fond either of fruit, or debating societies.
Rev. J. Hill presided, and told the young
men that cultivating their brains would make
them as great as if they joined a team of gentle-
men and went home to play for gate-money—or
even greater. A mixed programme was carried
out, in two parts, Mr. A. Flower being accom-
panist, and he. Miss E. Flower, and Miss L. Lane,
nlayed several piano selections. Miss Lane sang
"Yesterday” and another ballad rather sottly,
but with much sweetness ; Mr. Neote gave *’ Lon-
don Bridge ” and another song with a smooih
correctness which contrasted with the excessive
vigor of Mr. Hawkins’ " Will o’ the Wisp,” Mr.
Wtuart recited “The Little Hero,” and Mr. Batch-
elor recited the most meritorious Item of the
evening, entitled “ Not on the Programme ; ”
telling how a pretty young widow was en-
gaged by a theatrical manager, and how,
amid the crash of cheers that greeted her success
one evening, her sailor husband Inot drowned;
rushed on the stage while she fainted in his arms,
aod the audience would have him in his sailor
clothes, and no one else, to lead their pale, trembl-
ing, but happy young favourite in front of the
curtalc again. The piece was very long, and most
creditably spoken. Kretschmanu's young pupil,
Frank Smith, gave a clever violin solo, accompanied
by ms sister, Miss Ada, on the piano, but he de-
clined an encore on the ground that he was already
exhausted by his exertions in the public cause.
Miss Ada Smith, who is a pupil of Miss Hastings,
recited *• The Spanish Champion ” with admirable
self-possession, and when encored she told In a
charmingly piquant way “How Dennis took the
Pledge.” Wo had almost forgotten thefruit-it
came on in the interval. Ah remained seated,
except a few selected young gentlemen adorned
with red ribbons, who handed round light eatables,
fruit, coffee, lemonade, and so on, of which there
was plenty, and the idea altogether worked well.
It was quite worth the evening to hoar Frank play,
or Mr. Batchelor s tine recitation; but we would
freoiy give ihe moderate price for admission again
to-morrow, only to gaze on Miss Smith’s admirable
Langtry friz.

Ivo Bligh, lately reproduced, with some
variations, toe story of the Peer who being nonest
inventus on his wedding-night was found snoring
comfortably in hts library. After the wedding,
Ivo and his bride repaired to Macedon, and that
night he strolled out to smoke a cigar, while his
lady-love retired to rest. Ivo, however, failed to
return, and the newly-made bride passed the night,
sighing, like Mar dana, “ Tae night Is lone and
dreary : ho eometh not.” &c. At early dawn, she
roused the house, and the hapless bridegroom was
found “bushed” a quarter of a mile from the
place. Meditating, doubtless, on his new life, he
had aimlessly wandered on, and thus got "jugged”
on his wedding-night In the mazy Australian bush
Bligh could hardly look upon this as a Bllgh-tho

with a large and gay gathering last week, about
KO being present, with Saurbier’s music, a good
floor, and a most tasty refreshment table which
contained everything consistent with teetutsllsm.
Some programmes were nearly full before the
dancing commenced. We hear that the committee
desire to discourage this, and will request fair
ladles in future to bring blank programmes only

■ilk poplin and brocade, long trained. Mrs. Pemell
In black silk, Mrs Stutchbury In black brochd, and
Mrs. Carson In black and silver grenadine, all
looked well. Two fair sisters. Misses Muir, wore
conspicuous dresses—do. p pink satin bodies and

Waverley, wore the prettiest and airiest dress in
the room, a pink brochd bodice with Elizabethan
lace ruff, and pink tulle skirt with waterfall, all
dotted with pink and blue ihemllle drops, and
long looped bows of pink and blue ribbons. It was
exceedingly artistic. Another tulle dress of black,
with cardinal satin body, was noticeable on ac-
count of the peculiarly boomerangv shape as-
sumed by Its wearer when dancing. Misses Pearce
wore cream and blue satin dresses ; Misses Fltz-
Stubbs, of Manly, pretty striped white dresses,
with gathered bodies, flounced skirts, and gold
belts ; two Idolised dancers, Misses Walton, cream
satin and muslin, trimmed with birds. One stylish
dress was whlto brochd and silk, adorning a grace-
ful brunette. A pretty pink muslin, draped with
lace, was worn by a merry-faced blonde with short
hair ; and a mauve brochd combined well with
cream lace. A cardinal velvet redingote and
■rushed strawberry satin skirt were prominent
and handsome ; Missrs Wentworths’ tall figures
were garbed, one in blue sateen and pearls, the

stylish toilette was black velvet top, .Mth bow in

Not far north of Coalopolis there was a
grand wedding at Christmas, and much pains were
taken to decorate the church, ft was only on
entering to take a general bird’s-eye view, ten
minute# before the ceremony began, that the
bride’s mother discovered tier well Intontioned
friends had stretched right across rt»o altar a
banner bearing in large letters the words—“ Unto
us a child is born.” It was thought advisable to
remove it* before the clergyman entered upon his
duty of explaining to the young couple the rites
and purposes of matrimony.

able premises, and of enlarging and extending the

Jf- istnwed aud’Mecirvb action is uecessasy, and I
altfo a much larger number of workers, to secure
whom is one of the primary objects of the meet-
ing. This Club is not connected with any sect or
association whatever, so that helpers of all shades
of opinion will be welcomed; and it is to be hoped
that all those nterested In the subject of howto
enable lads to pass their evenings harmlessly and
pleasantly will attend. Experience shows more
and more plainly that the problem is one which
cannot be solved except at the cost of some per-
sonal sacrifice.

Last week, two clever musicians were
joined in holy union, Mr, Percy Jones, the popular
vocalist, and Miss Lottie Hyatn, of Balmain. The
bride wore a pretty short ivory satin, with full
lace flounces caught up by ribbons; deep reversed
puffings with paniers of lace at waist, and full
drapery behind; sleeves trimmed with lace and
finished with bows; flowers at neck. They went to
Melbourne for the honeymoon by express, whence
they were hurriedly recalled by the sad death of
Mr. Jones’s father, on Sunday. Miss Hyam has for
years been known as one of the most accomplished
pianistes in the colony.
To gain that skill, what hours resigned
Have been to practice in the past!
But now, Mks Lottie, may you find,
Like all good girls, reward at last.
We trust two voices, joyful, clear,
Will blend in sweet harmonious tones,
And you, so used to Percy-vere,
Will happy be with Percy Jones,

The Okie Englyahe Fayre was revived on
Easter Monday in St. James’s schoolroom at Forest
Lodge, with a view of clearing off the parish
debt. From what we saw, it is very likely to clear
off some of the parisn gins as well. They are
choice specimens of persistent prettiness, with
“taking” ways; and then they are so good, too.
We wont there as a stranger, and they “took us
■ in ” at once. In opening the show, the Rev. H. B.
Callachor explained that only fair devices would
be used to got money. We arc sure he said it con-
scientiously ; but is it fair to pick the best-looking
girls in the parish, and, when they’ve got their
daintiest drosses on, and their hair piled up dla
chinoUie, and their lovely faces set in eternal
smiles, allow them to attack male persons who
never did them any harm, but who have con-
fidingly stept into the Fayre just to have a look?
Is it fair to open a battery of female fas-
cinations on th-i said men that leaves them in
one short quarter of an hour dazzled and totally
destitute? If that’s fair, we pass. Mr. Henry
Daley also made a speech. In it's general effect,
the Fayre is pretty and ingeniously arranged ; six
stills with old fashioned red gable roofs, in charge
of ladles as follow Harp of Erin, Mistresses
8cott and Whelan ; Shamrock and Thistie, Mis-
tresses Young and Chisholm ; Cornucopia, Mis-
tresses Brennan and Meline ; British Lion, Misses
Lawn and Edmunds ; Liose and Crown, Mistresses
Saclier and McDonald ; Little House under the
Hill, Mistresses Robertson and Lea. Thou the
Post Office was evidently manufactured by a
humorist—an exact imitation of a little red brick
shanty whoso cracked walls were covered with old
notices—“ Ye Forest Lodge Males will depart for
Sydney every morning at 9 o’clock ’’—and “ Ye
Fee-males will meet at ye Post Otfu e as usual—on
y<-‘ blocko,” &a. The Mistres.es wore assisted by
a body ot light skirmishers in fancy dress, and
proceedings opened (under the direction of Mr.
T. Callachor as Sir W. Raleigh) by their marching
round headed by a tiny golden-haired Queen,
Miss Slattery. She was attired in white satin,
quilted petticoat, and a court train of blue plush
borne by pages, and behind followed six little
maids all in bridal array with wreaths of orange-
blossoms complete The o her snirrnishers did uot
confine thmselvcs to the old Englisu style, but
launched oat into any stylo they considered suita ble
to plunder; more especially that time-sanctified
combination of white muslin, black \elvet, and
red bows, which at Fayre time so often transforms
ordinarily nice girls into merciless female banditti.
Miss Alleyne was an English peasant; Mrs. Hen-
sleigh adaughterof the regiment; and Mrs.George
Sheiloy, a Odpsy. Miss Eastmure also carried on
her depredations as a Gipsy, in an extra-pretty
dross or blue veiling, bodice ending in small pointed
tabs with bells, and a short scarlet skirt. The
wheel ot fortune was spun by Miss Maher; and
little Miss Florrie Guy was the Old Woman who
lived in a Shoe. Miss Florrie Eastmure made a
delicious Dolly Warden, in scarlet quilted petti-
coat, watteau over-skirt, and hat wreathed in rye
and poppy flowers. It made us feel almost
"poppy.” Peg Woffington was the character of Miss
Meline, and Wilfrida, a Saxon lady, was that of
Miss Djnnellan, though we suspect the vivacious
young lady was really no more Saxon than the
doll she carried and couldn’t sell. Red Riding
Hoods role was archly taken by Miss Wilson; a
Norwegian peasant by Miss Davis; Misses Agnes
and Alice O Connor were two of the Marie Stuart
galaxy—Mary Seton and Mary Beaton, Two pretty
maids of honour were Miss Lawn and Miss Martha
Lawn, tho dress of green sateen, ridged sleeves in-
let with ruby pullings, in one case, being varied
by crushed strawberry and sleeves inlet with
yellow in the other; and both wore pearls, and
looked stylish and handsome. Miss O’Rourke was a
dear little sailor; and there were other belles too
numerous to catalogue, too pressing to refuse,
and each and all more likely to bo famous for
their beauty than their conscience. They ari still
on view.

On Wednesday, the 9th of April, Mrs.
Marshall, of “ Fail-light,” Elizabeth Bay, gave a
very pleasant dance at her residence. The guests,
numbering about fifty, began to arrive soon after
half-past eight, p.m., and dancing was carried on
with spirit until an early hour next morning. The
verandahs overlooking the pretty and romantic
grounds (which command a lino view of our
•‘Beautiful Harbour”) formed an agreeable
promenade for couples between the dances, and
were much availed of for strolls en deux. The
hostess, who wore black satin, was indefatigable
in her attentions to her irlends, and most desirous
to promote their comfort in every way. The
aquatic eleven was well represented. Somo pretty
costumes wore noticeable among the ladies of the
company. It is, as we know, to feminine t*sto in
dress that so much of a ballroom’s charm isdue, for
a room would be sombre indeed if only dependent
for effect on the orthodox dress suit and white tie;
it is at fancy balls alone that the sterner sex can
hope to vie, even to a small extent, in personal
adornment with their fair neighbours. White,
cream, and pink seemed the prevailing and
favoured shades, and one or two black ones were
to bo seen aa well. Miss S. Eagar wore a light and
elegant white spotted net over white silk, and
Miss King, of Kiama, a pretty pink dress; a cream
and cardinal on a brunette young lady was effec-
tive, and a white flounced muslin with gold waist
ribbon looked nice on a tall damsel. The visitors
began to depart between three and four o’clock,
after having spent a very enjoyable evening.

An organ recital, complimentary to Mr.
H. A. Stuart, poet, was given In the Wesleyan
Church, Bourkc-street, recently by Mr. Fred. Mor-
ley, organist of the church. The entertainment
was by invitation only, about 500 tickets being
Issued. The programme comprised se'ectlons
from the works of Bach, Mendelssohn, Handei,
WiMv, Rink, and Rossini, which wore rendered in
a style that evoked marked recognition from the
critical audience present. Mr. Morley has a
reputation for expression and finish in delicate
, passages, and those on the programme of this
character—more especially an adagio of Mozart
—showed his facto. Wcly’s UfTortulre No. i,
the triumphant concluding movements of
Rinks “God save the Queen,” and Bach's “St.
Ann’s Fugue’’-the latter, perhaps, one of the
grandest organ pieces written—were faultlessly
given ; and the overture to *' Tancredi,” one of
Rossini's best efforts, fairly raised enthusiasm.
The recital was interspersed with vocal selections
by the Misses Bhipway, and Messrs. M‘Clelland and
Callaghan, members of the Church choir. The
entertainment was closed by the “ Hallelujah
Chorus.” A unanimous wish was expressed that
Mr. Morley's objections to public performances
might bo so far overcome as to induce him to play
on ourainjy docent public instrument, that In the
gseat mill uf the University.

years at Muswellbrook, takes a holiday. His
parishioners gave him a comfortable £240. The

by the Liedertafel, was bidden farewell by
about 50 gentlemen connected with the in-

Kiama. who has returned from an European trip,
was affectionately fed by over 100 of his friends at

master at Old Junee was going to leave, it was
found the Railway Department s rules would not
permit his accepting a testimonial. So they gave
the sovereigns to his wife, and she gave them to
him. It’s just as easy as dummying land, you see...
• Gladys” gives the best costume worn at the
grand Masonic ball In Melbourne, as, an amber
tulle, beautifully shaped and spotted with gold
beads, the bodice being of bronze-brown velvet;
and very pretty it must have looked, especially if
the wearer had sunset h»ir. A great many dancers
waltzed in the new “ Kensington ” attitude, which
consists in the gentleman’s holding his partner at
arm’s length. There is no particular gain by a
gentleman’s handling a lady just like a mowing-
scythe, but it’s the new style ...The ladies of
nevuka gave a leap-year ball last month, and the
young gentlemen who were not asked to dance,
looked very Fiji-ty —An ingenious Blue-ribbon

a major that Mr. Rowe’s name will go down to
posterity—This is a cheerful little fragment we
picked up. “ Of course, you will go to the Lieder-
tafel. Miss Agonisa ?” “ Well, I’m not sure. You

inquired : “ Shall I go in front of this hoop ?”
“ Yes,” he replied, “ all ladies go in front of hoops
now.” Her face resembled a No. 4 red.

Dear Belle,— Easter, with its hot-cross bun*
(which, by the way, are never hot when we get
them), red-coated volunteers, uncertain weather,
and sacred concerts, is about over, and has been
just as dull as Easter should properly be. We
went to hear “ Stabat Mater,” at the Theatre Royal,
on Good Friday night, but I am sorry to say I
can’t give you a favourable account of the per-
formance. Why the concert did not commence
until twenty minutes to nine we were at a loss to
understand, and the absence of programmes was
also incomprehensible. We could have forgiven
these trifles had the concert been even fair-but it
wasn’t. The soloists were : Madame Merz, Miss
St. Clair, Mr. Halleweil, and a tenor whose name I
forget. All the performers had an air of de-
pression which led mo to think they had eaten too
many buns for breakfast. The conductor, evi-
dently being aware of the weak points of his
chorus, made special efforts that they should keep
time, so beat with foot and b&ton, and in the first
crescendo passage got so excited, and emphasized
his strokes so vigorously, that he sent his baton
flying into the audience. This, as you may be
sure, highly delighted the uppermost circle, who
were not altogether complimentary In their re-
marks. The first and second soprano duet, sung
by Madame Merg and Mis* St. Clair, was not what
we expected to hear from two sipsh artists, the
scale passage In thirds being extremely rugged, but
Miss St. Clair's and Mr. Hallewell’s solos were two
of the rede miug points of the Stabat Mater por-
tion of the concert. The unaccompanied quartette
had also some merit, but in the ” Inflammatus.”
Madame Merz’s voice was altogether too severely
tested. Of the “Cujus Animara,” the best that
can be said is that the singer did his best with a
pleasant voice of small compass and Indifferent
culture. A groat number of the audience left the
theatre at the close of the first part, being, per-
haps, unaware that there was more to come. The
orchestra played “ The War March of the Priests,”
from Athalle, as an introduction to the second
part of the concert, and In it seemed to be some-
what roused from their apathy. Mr. Beaumont
Reid’s rendering of “ He was despised,” was very
delightful, and I must say bis voice sounds as pure
and fresh as ever. A few more solos wore given
by various lingers, when terminated what was on
the whole a disappointing concert.
As a matter of course, the day being Good Friday,
the circle dresses were inclined to bo sombre. A
pretty young French lady, who is following the
musical profession, wore a black lace dress out half
low, with a white tucker and white kid gloves. Her
?:olden hair was dressed high and fastened with an
mmenso gold ornament, but a rich loose plait
hung down the back as well. A trio in white
dresses with black sashes, hair bows, and long kid
gloves, and silver bangles, looked neat. There
were only about two coloured dresses to be seen,
and they were a very handsome pink satin and a
pale blue of the same material. Amongst so
many black* and whites they stood out well, and
were quite a relief to the eye. Miss 8t. Clair
always dresses in a fashion her own, and shows
nice taste, too. Her dress was of the richest white
silk, with deep flounces of white duchosse lace
covering the whole front of the skirt, whilst the
long train was simply of the silk lined with purple
satin. The bodice was In the Elizabethan style,
the lace collar being very high at the back of the
nosk, but falling open in front and displaying a
low-cut walst-cant of the purple satin, over which
the bodice was caught at the waist by a handsome
brooch. Madame Merz wore a black lace dross
with long train and cardinal flowers.
We went to the Canary Show the other day, and
now I shall never know what the canary colour
signifies. Some were pale primrose, others as deep
as buttercups, and a good many were nearly green,
whilst there were heaps of a nondescript colour.
Just fancy a little canary being worth a hundred
guineas I There were very few people there when

Mr. W. P. Cox, whose concert on Good
Friday night was something of a lizzie, has per-
sonally been rather hardly dealt with. The chorus
was the weak point, and, as sometimes happens,
“supers” who had rehearsed and practised did not
turn up at the concert, and volunteers who had
not practised at ai I did. Mr. Cox has good creden-
tials as a violinist and conductor.

we went, but It was no wonder, for the weather
wasn’t at all tempting. I never like to see birds
cagod. I think it is dreadfully cruel to rob them
of their liberty; but, then, when they are worth
4d ,much, it is almost worth while to overcome
gtuih scruples. And such handsome prizes some of-
them wonl
We left the pretty little dicky-birds to their
prisons and their prizes, and went to Paling’s to
get the song you asked for. When there, our
attention was drawn to a beautiful Cottage Plano
which was shown in the window. It was a French
Brard; and, if the inside workmanship equalled the
ease, it must, Indeed, be a magnificent instrument.
The splendid marqueterie work of various woods.
Ivory, malachite, mother-of-pearl, heavily gilt
"brass, and other materials, was really something
to admire. X generally doubt a piano with a hand-
some case, but we were assured that the tone of
this one ia question was simply perfect.
I saw a pretty design for a smoking cap yester-
day. Instead of being braided, embroidered, or
worked in crewels it was simply made turban
shape, of plain but rich velvet, and in front the
wearer's monogram was worked in gold ; and an-
other had the full Christian name embroidered in
silver. A happy idea it would be to have beside the
name or monogram, a symbol of any special hobby;
for instance tor a boating mao, a boat or pair of
sculls—a cricketer, bat and ball; music, a lyre and
BO forth.
I hear It whispered that Messrs. Moser and
Maclean’s operetta “ Populaire ” is again to have
a semi-private rehearsal at Paling’s rooms, on
Saturday. Surely Mr. McLean will be wise and get
together some good voices and do his composition
Justice 1 At the same time it is a terribly difficult
thing to patch up a good chorus, and as for soloists,
they are nearly as scarce as civil Post Office Offi-
cials. I wonder why we so seldom hear of poor
Packer’s “ Crown of Thoms ? ” I have heard that
Mr. Stanley, of Stanmore, is' responsible for not
a little of that beautiful work, but I cannot vouch
for the truth of it. Anyhow, if he is, he is very
modest about it.
The prettiest walking dress I have seen this
week was a white flannel with royal blue sleeves
and plastion. Each flounce had a good broad
binding of velvet, and the tunic was very short
and full. An enormous Duchess hat with
heavy black plumes completed this pretty
costume. The Duchess hat is having a hard
fight with the Henri deux, but I think and hope
the former will be victorious. You must certainly
let me order you some “ Silver King ” collars, for
I know they will please you. They are made with
a linen band, about an inch in width, from which
is taken a rich frill of good embroidery-quite
simple, you see, but very becoming. And, talking
of the “Silver King,” reminds me of a most un-
common dress I saw in the theatre one night last
week. Black velvet with old gold plush epaulettes
and slashings. The neck was cut half low and
edged with rich old gold Spanish lace, and you
would hardly believe how effective it was although
so simple. A real rosy red satin with lace trim-
mings was worn by a tall dark lady, and although
the colour was daring, it was so arttullv modulated
with the lace that one could hardly call it bad taste.
I notice the peculiar taste for wearing silver and
gold insects in hats and hair is fast growing upon
us. A lady sitting close to me one night bad a
tiny silver moth in her hair, and for a moment I
really expected to see it take wing it was so true
an Imitation. I don’t dislike the butterfly or moth
ornaments, but the spiders and lizards are atro-
cious.
I have no Brisbane news for you, excepting that
M.T. is soon to be married, and a bonnie bride she
will make, tool—Yours ever,

Tho Australian Jockey Club had magnifi-
cent weather for the opening day of their Autumn
meeting, on Monday last, and the attendance must
have counted over twenty thousand. In the
Hurdle Race Flamborough defeated Yately by
three-quarters of a length, after a great race up
the straight, War Eagle third ; Morpeth started at
6 to 4 on him for the Autumn Stakes, but was
unable to run into a place, Sardonyx taking pride
of place by three-quarters of a length from Archie,
Sweet William third: 5 to 4 was laid on Bargo
for the Champion Stake, and he justified
the confidence placed in him by defeating his
stable companion Salvo by a neck for first place,
Garfield third ; only the pair Martini-Henry and
Le Grand toed the scratch for the St. Leger, the
first named at once taking command and leading
to the distance, when Le Grand shot o»t and won
comfortably by a length, in 3 mlg. 10>6 sec., the
fastest time yet recorded for a St- Leger ; Rataplan
led from start to finish of the Doncaster Handicap,
Victress, 2nd ; Hypatia, 3rd ; and | Ventia de-
feated Cairngorn by half a length for the Trial
Stakes, Tremando third.
The Tam worth trouble deepens. We men-
tioned in last issue that we had received a letter
enclosing newspaper clippings, and inviting us to
“slate Hooke. The following was the letter:—
“ Tamworth, April 2nd, 1884 Editor Bulletin,—
Please try and make something out of this, and
slate Hooke, so that I can copy It, and oblige.
Fours truly, S. Joseph.” Our rejoinder was
published last week, and was to the effect
that we would enjoy tweaking the nose
of the fellow who invited us to be the
channel of his spleen. Since that was published,
we have received a letter Mr. Sol. Joseph, of
the Tamworth News informing us that he sent
no such communication as that received by us.
On comparison of the first and second letters, wo
find no similarity whatever in the handwritings.
It seems, therefore, as though some very clever
person has perpetrated a little joke, at the slight
cost of exposing himself to a prosecution for
forgery. It goes without saying that we sym-
pathise with Mr. Joseph in the annoyance he must
have suffered, and that we are much concerned at
having been made the Instrument. Wo will co-
operate with him in endeavouring to bring the
offender to account.
Some few weeks ago, a short description
of Mr. J. G. Harborow’s bijou establishment, 470
George-street, appeared in these columns, and now
it appears that the enterprising proprietor, in
order to keep pace with the goddess Fashion, has
determined to open a new department, viz., Paris
millinery. The first shipment of these hign-class
goods will arrive by the incoming P. and O.
steamer Rome, and arrangements have been made
that the newest and latest styles will arrive by
every succeeding mail. Mr. tiarborow has given
his home buyer carte blanche, and if that gentle-
man displays his taste for selection as well as he
has chosen the present magnificent and well-
assorted stock, some very fashionable and tastenll
specimens of milliners’ art may be expected.
Owing to increase of business, Mr. Harborow has
found it necessary to enlarge his already immense
stock of hosiery and gloves, and amongst the now
lines just received is a complete assortment of
Dent’s gauntlet gloves, in all sizes and all the
newest fashionable shades. The establishment is
most centrally located at 470 George-street, oppo-
site the Market", and, being convenient to’buses
and trams, will no doubt be a favourite resort with
our fashionable ton.

Mr. Mark J. Hammond, ex-Mayor of
Ashfield.
The subject of this sketch, Mr. Mark J. Hammond,
ex-Mayor of Ashfleld, was born in Sydney, Nov.
15,1844. His father, a sterling representative of an
old Kentish family, came to tha colony three years
previously, and entered upon agricultural pursuits.
Heavy losses by drought, which at that period
were general all over the colony, resulted in the
family removing to the goldfields. This change in
their prospects found young Mark Hammond,
then but a mere youth, resolutely battling with
fortune, and few men a histories exhibit such
vicissitudes, or disclose such self-dependence, cou r-
age, resolution, or perseverance. He may be said
to have virtually had no boyhood, lor, at the age
of sixteen, with no friend but a younger brother,
he was a lull-fledged miner, on ,.ew and distant
goldfields, exercising the right and voting as a
miner under the existing law. He experienced
the varying successes of the Turon, the Lambing
Flat, the Macquarie, Forbes, and other goldfields.
His intuitive Knowledge gave him a mastery over
the men he fell in with, the result, in most cases,
of correct judgment in the search of the precious
metal. Before he was eighteen, young Hammond
had accumulated a considerable sum, but was vic-
timised by designing speculators. Changes of for-
tune found him pretty near direllct at Hawkins’
Hill. Certain shareholders of the principal mine,
to ensure Hammond's assistance, bought him a
share for £500, transferring it to him "without a
scrap of paper or document. Mr. Hammond, while
still retaining an interest in several mines, then
came to Sydney, where he has been successful in
real estate investments. His career on the gold
fields was not without profit in another way. He
fell In, as it were from sympathy, with the best
educated men on the various fields. Experience
shows that many a man who wooed fortune in the
rugged pursuits of gold-mining, in the good old
days, had passed through the English tlniveisities,
and was a capital companion for an observant
and reflective lad. When Hammond ceased his
mining operations, he thus entered upon the pur-
suits of city life with a knowledge of men tested
by experience. His work in the metropolis has
been of a very valuable character, and his contri-
butions to the Press on all the great questions of
the day demonstrate him to be a man of philo-
sophic thought and practical research. He is the
author of some of the ablest vindioations of John
Stuart Mill as to assisting native industry. Mr.
Hammond likewise aided the removal of the
gold tax. His contributions on the necessity of
mining-law reform have beenjproductive of practi-
cal results in the way of preparing the pub-
lic mind for reform in the existing law. In muni-
cipal work Mr. Hammond has proved himself a
thorough representative. As an alderman of the
Ashfleld Council, ho originated the Idea of a system
basing taxation on capital value, leading to a more
even and equitable method than had ruled; and
■though delayed and hindered, his proposals are de-
stined to become law, and to meet with adontion,
not only in a municipal, but a national sense.
Mr. Hammond, although defeated at the lust
general election, is now again a candidate for
Legislative honours. Having offered himself for
the seat vacated by Mr. W. H. Wright, for the
electorate of Canterbury—and taking as a cri-
terion the able manner in which ho has conducted
the municipal affairs of the Borough of Ashfleld,
where he had the honour of being elected Mayor
three consecutive years, and his character for in-
tegrity in the private and public relations of life,
the constituency might choose a far worse repre-
sentative.
Hanlan gave a second show at Manly on
Easter Monday, when he rowed a desperate three-
mile race with Bob Edwards, went through the
old tricks, and performed the unrehearsed feat of
trying to travel head first on the water with his
galvanised tanks attached to his feet.

U.
For ages the alphabet was a happy family.
The letters lived together amicably, and allowed
their creator, Man, to combine them in an endless
variety of syllables, words, and sentences, for the
{mrpose of communicating with his distant lel-
ows, or passing his thoughts on to posterity. They
were divided into patricians and plebs. There
were five of the former A, K, I, O. U, just like our
own five orders of dear old English nobility, while
the others were commoners pure and simple, with
no hope of ever being raised to the peerage, and
no voice la public affairs, except when acting
under the leadership of one or more of the nobles.
The positions of W and Y were peculiar and occa-
sionally humiliating, One had a vote in the ITpper
House when he was in charge of a few of the mob,
and stood at their head, while the other enjoyed
a similar brevet rank when marching at the rear
of one or two privates. But their position was
unthankful and irritating at the best When,
owing to their temporary appointments, they
enjoyed the privilege of associating with the
hereditary aristocrats, A, E. I, O, and U. the latter
superciliously tolerated them just as the officers
of a war-ship the advances of the bo’s’n,
and when—their mission being ended—they
returned to the ranks, they wore hustled and
ohlvvl»d by the roughs from B to Z who,
with the brutality of low natures, rejoiced at the
misfortunes of their bettors. The live representa-
tive peers—vowels they wore sometimes called—
were the belly of the body corporate and the
others—they were known as consonants-tho mem-
bers. Once or twice it was said the latter rebelled
and endeavoured to sot up a government of their
own, but their efforts ended in a failure more or
Jesa complete. No one could understand the
language they tried to speak, and tliov couldn’t
understand themselves, so tit‘it they had always to
comeback and submit to their natural leaders.
It was only under these that they were lit for
polite society. Twice, indeed, they came very near
to a separate est thlishment in Wales and in
Russia. By cumbrous combinations they some-
times succeeded in getting a hearing on the Steppes
and amid Welsh fastnesses. But it was when they
tried to go on their own hook, among the French,
Spaniards, Italians and others deriving their
tongue from old Uorao, that their discomfiture
was entire and humiliating. And yet the cause of
this ill-success is not quite clear. Some of them
such as L. M, and R. wore rather fond of society,
•nd could conduct themselves in any company,
frqt others, especially X and Z were lll-favouned
and rebellious and introduced diseord Into any
society foolish enough to give them a footing.
* • •
One clay A, E, I, and O, were in council
talking of the phonetic stylo of spelling that was
making such havoc in the department of ortho-
graphy. X was on duty at the door chiefly to
keep out W and Y, who were loafing about out-
side waiting for a chance to dodge in before they
were wanted. Just then U came in crying and
took his place without speaking. On being asked
the cause of his sorrow he wiped his eyes and said
ho’a been subject' d to a gross indignity at the
hands of an American schoolmaster. “I was in
his parlour as usual,” said poor U, “ when he came
in whittling a clothes’ peg and whistling ‘Yankee
Doodle.’ Directly he saw me he howled ‘here,
blast you, didn’t 1 tell you I didn’t want you in my
p arlour any more ? If I can’t put you out o’ my
house,’ he continued, ‘at all events I’ll shunt you
out o’ my best room. So git, or I’ll hist you, and
you may be thankful to be allowed to stick in the
mud outside, where you’ve been eversrace I knew
you.’ ‘Sir,’ said I, haughtily, for his insolence
nettled me, ‘ I’d have vou know that Ihold a place
in the proudest, as well as the humblest houses. I
have been brought up in a court. I have been
constantly associated with use and beauty. With-
out mo they would not exist. This Is the first
time I’vo been asked to give up my position in a
gentleman’s parlour. I hold the second place in
Europe and Australia, and the first in the United
States. Even Russia’s Ctnsar cannot Issue a ukase
without my help, or ’twould be a kase with
him. A stranger to the past and present, I
have an important interest in the future, and am
always in tnc very middle of youth. Though but
an unassuming vowel. I am constantly in request
and never shirk duty.’’ “Yos,” said he, sarcasti-
cally. “and whenever any humbug is being served
round I notice you’re up to your ears in it. Be-
sides," he said, with an offensive leer, “If I shift
you from my parlor, It's because there was only an
interjection between you and L.” “Sir,” I con-
tinued, scarcely deigning to notice his insinuations,
“ but for me music would bean unmeaning jumble,
your big drum dlent. and your flute without its
centre joint. Even in your ‘lush’ I am present,
nor can you eject me from the rum you drink or
the lump of sugar you sweeten it with. Without
me you would live in perpetual silence—sound
would be unknown—the very bounds of your great
nation would be changed to bonds. (Indeed, al-
though you may succeed in ht-istlng me, as you
elegantly express it, out of your parlour, you
cannot banish me from your soul. I shall still be
found in your haunts, your soup, and your suppers.
Whenever you listen to the truth, for which the
newspapers of your great Democracy are famous,
or tell it, which (this was desiccating sarcasm) is
devilish unlikely, you will find me coiled up lu the
midst of it. You took me in with your suck, and,
as sure as my name is U, you’ll never have luck
without me. “ And. now, sir, I added,” backing
towards the door, for I didn’t like the light in his
left eye, “ you can banish me from your favor,
your parlor, your neighborhood, but you can’t
separate me from honour.” He tripped me up
before I reached the door, and, taking me by the
scruff, yelled, “Yes, the American Eagle has
busted up bigger tramps than you afore uow an
wiu agin. You can no to your rotten old Europe,
or bentam Australia, and plant yourself right in
their slums, but you don’t hang round this neigh-
borhood no more. I lost 103 dollars in ink last year
by giving you the run of my house and grounds.
So, git and tell your mates, A, E, I, and O that our
\ ankee boys ’ll prance in among them too one U’
these fine days, an’ give ’em fits with this new
phonetic dodge of ours. Tell ’em that we have
our eyes on the miserable flunkeys, the con-
sonants, also, an ’ll give ’em slops when we’re
finished with the big bugs, and get our new spell-
in’ machine fixed up,” With that he lifted me out
of the parlour into the middle of a mound of mud,
and if ever I’m seen in houor, neighbor, parlor,
flavor,' savior, labor, or any of that breed, on the
Columbian side of the Atlantic, may the hand be
palsied that no w signs itself—

AN OUTRAGED VOWEL.
bays an exchange: “The alligator is said
to feed in a somewhat peculiar way. First he
stretches himself out in a liaely spot; tnea he
opens his cavern of a mouth to its fullest extent,
so that you’d think it was a log of wood spilt m
two with a wedge; then ha waggles his tongue;
then a mosquito or two rests on it; then a frog or
so steps In to prospect; a snake follows to devour
a frog; then a jackass comes after the snake; a
cat comes around fter the bird; and being pur-
sued by a dog the saurian thinks time’s up; the
upper half of the log fails, and —that’s the first
course !’’ This reminds us of a wager we once
made with a negro over in Alabama. The darkey
bet us 50 cents, he could plunge into the water and
kill an alligator with a butcher’s knife. The last
seen of that alligator the shiny heels of a negro
were just passing down it’s throat.
Not long ago, Mr. Murray Smith (he ought
to bo Admiral Smith by this time) read a paper in
Bt. James’ Hall, London, on "The Australian
Dominion.” and the discussion which followed
was rather livelier than those somniferous pow-
wows generally are. Our own Agent-General led
off by the rather Munchausen remark that the
whole of the Australian colonies were bound
together by the sacred bonds of friendship. The
chairman, however, took that trick by asking if it
is true the colonies are all a band of loving sisters
how is it one Sir William Morgan piteously en-
quired, recently, “ Why, oh why, then do we search
each other’s portmanteaus ?” Nobody anew. Not
even the geuerous Murry Smith could tell, and
then Mr. Wilfred Powell struck the floor and
knocked the whole company of Agents out iu one
round by reeling off the following auecdote:—“I
am reminded, jasthere,” said Sir Wilfred, “of a
story which a gentleman once told me when travel-
ling with him by steamer. It appears he had
occasion to travel to the different Australian
ports on his way home from India, and not wishing
to be encumbered with much luggage, he only took
ms portmanteau with bun. in wnich was packea u,
valuable Indian shawl which he intended to pre-
sent to his wife in England. On landing at Ade-
laide, his portmanteau was searched, and he had to
pay duty on the shawl. At Melbourne, he was.told
by the official he would have to pay duty there.
“ But I have paid duty once already, at Adelaide,”
he remonstrated. “Can’t help that, sir,” replied
the official; “Adelaide’s nothing to do with us,
you will have to pay again — this is another
colony.” So he handed out again. Having to go
on to Sydney, he thought he would be safe there
but on arriving he was asked whether his port-
manteau contained anything but his personal
wearing apparel. “Yes,” he replied, “I have a
shawl for my wife.” “ Is your wife on board, sir.”
“ No, she’s in England.” “ Oh 1 then you’ll have to
pay duty on that shawl, sir.” My friend protested
he had paid twice already — once in Adelaide
and once in Melbourne. “ Can’t help that
sir,” said the other “ we don’t recognise those
places here ; this is a different part of Aus-
tralia altogether.” So he paid again. Going
up the river to Brisbane, he happened to men-
tion the fact of his having to pay so often for
the shawl. “OhI ray dear sir,” said a charming
young lady who overheard him, “I can wear the
shawl until we go onshore, and then thei can’t
c arge you for it.” The gentleman was glad to
let her put it on, and so, as he thought, escape duty,
hut when he got on shore he was rather disgusted
to find the charming young lady had cleared, and
taken the shawl along with her. Not half a bad
tale, but for one thing. There is no duty on shawls
in N.S. Wales Nevertheless, the story fairly shows
how strongly the colonies are at present bound
together by the sacred bonds of friendship,

feeble frame,
With a care-worn two-pound suit on (and his feet
had scarce a boot on).
To the door where stood Jack Bruton—that’s the
cheerful landlord’s name;
Leaned and lounged the fly Jack Bruton—that’s
the bully landlord’s name.
Slow and faint the stranger’s pace was, sad to look
upon his face was;
On It many a bitter trace was of a by-gone time
of woe.
Like a meat-axe, gapped and battered, was his pro-
file. and the tattered
Rags upon him had not flattered any bush-con-
trived scare-crow—
Had not over-dressed or flattered any average
scare-crow.
In a voice that was a wail, he to the landlord told
the tail he
Had to tell, and said “ Australy has no vacancy
for me;
Nought but trouble has occurred In all my life,
which is a burden,
And I wish I was interred In some successful
cemotree—
Yes, I wish Bob Craig would cart me to the bloom-
ing cemetroo.
looked upon mo sadly, and said ‘Once
we d welcomed gladly
llke yon, who’d capered madly through a
brilliant list of crimes,
tflied*tho C chayor l )rayer * an( l y° u might have
Hot no w we’yo had the Mayor—wo move along
to suit the times,
And I hardly think your countenance quite hits
the present times.’
“Thus I’ve lost the one last hope I had, and, if I
had a rope, I
Would find out what sort of scope I’ll have in
_ other world’s than this,
Hot l ll hang out till to-morrow, when I’m hanged
if I don t borrow
What will close a life of sorrow that no other life
will miss—
What will hang a human failure none in all the
world will miss.
“Aye, I’ll shortly know for certain what lies hid
behind the curtain:
And when they have heaped the dirt in on the
cold remains of Bloggs,
These sad words my fate will live in—‘ Pray his
last address is Heaven
Who through all his days was driven to the devil
and the dogs—
was driven to the everlasting
“And I’ve come to ask if you will, ere I seek this
ending cruel.
Stand a pint—for Farrell's brow will cheer me
ere I do the deed ?
Yes J’„. Then with tbe Wollondilly elixir fill up this
Dllly,
And augment your kindness, will you, Avlth a
shakedown and a feed—
With a shakedown in the stable, and a final fare-
well feed?"
And the landlord standing by was moved, and dim
with tears his eye was,
And immediate his reply was, “Yea, poor stranger
most forlorn,
You shall have what you apply for, and shall win
the end you sigh for:
A new clothes-line I will buy for you to swing
with in the morn—
A reliable new clothes-line shall be yours to-
morrow morn.”
So that night the desperate stranger slept securely
in a manger,
Knowing all Life’s doubt and danger with the
morning would bo o’er;
Then, arising from his pillow, cord in hand, sought
out a willow,
Saying “I fear I must your bill owe till I meet
you on the Shore-
Hope to square it when I meet you on the Shining
Golden shore."
And found out a purpose wise Is at the bottom
of my birth—
Pound out why I’ve been miraculously! ugly
from my birth.
•
“You remember how, despairing:, with a heart
fllied up with daring 1
Even of Death itself, uncaring 1 what might wait
in the Beyond,
I sped on with stops growing quicker—having
drained a long last liquor—
Down to where the willows flicker their light
shadows in the pond —
Where the ratepayers dip the water from the
green and ghastly pond.
“Don’t suppose that I am vain in saying that there
is no grain in

But upon this brain of mine broke the old‘gag.’
that if your line broke,
And I didn’t get my spine broke, death by drown-
ing wasn’t nice—
Death by drowning in green water is not popular
or nice.
“So I paused before deciding how to die: when
gaily riding
Past me went a swell, bestriding a most pre-
historic moke,
And two tawny hounds thatfollowed him attacked
me and half-swallowed
My poor form with hunger hollowed, while my
veils the morning woke—
While .1 y gory execrations all the sleeping city
woke.
“ How to live was all that ailed me now that danger
had assailed me
And a'l hope had well-nigh failed mo, when the
master of the bounds
Beat away the fangs that harried me, and had me
quickly carried
To his home, whereat I tarried until time had
healed my wounds-
Until Time and a crisp Fiver wholly healed mv
gaping wounds.
“ Well, things seemed a bit more pleasant, when, as j
I was convalescent,
(Boss, your glass is low at present I) I went out to
take the air.
And sat down upon a shady seat, beside a maiden
lady.
By whoso side a poodle played: he bit my leg in
Belmore-square—
Made a couple of incisions that she paid ten quid
to square.
“ Twice that week going out I rued of, for my legs
were almost chewed off
(Things I soon discerned the good of), and when
with «n eye to Law, ’
I went off to see a legal gentleman, his petted

AYER’S PILLS.
A large proportion of the diseases which
cause human suffering result from derange-
ment of the stomach, bowels, and liver.
Ayer’s Cathartic Pills act directly upon
these organs, and are especially designed to
cure the diseases caused by their derange-
ment, including Constipation, Indiges-
tion, Dyspepsia, Headache, Dysentery,
and a host of other ailments, for all of
which they are a safe, sure, prompt, and
pleasant remedy. The extensive use of these
Pills by eminent physicians in regular prac-
tice, shows unmistakably the estimation in
which they are held by the medical profes-
sion.
These Pills are compounded of vegetable
substances only, and are absolutely free from
calomel or any other injurious ingredient.
A Sufferer from Headache writes:
“Ayer’s Pills aro invaluable to me, and
are my constant companion. I have been
a severe sufferer from Headache, and your
Pills aro the only thing I could look to
for relief. One dose will quickly move my
bowels and free my head from pain. They
are tho and the easiest physio
I have ovoraRund. It is a pleasure to mo to
%peak in their praise, and 1 always do so
when occasion oners.
W. L. PAGE, of W. L. Pago & Bro.”
Franklin St., Richmond, Va., June 3,1882.
“I have used Ayer’s Pills In number-
less instances as recommended by you, and
have never known them to fail to accomplish
the desired result. Wo constantly keep them
on hand at our homo, and prize them as a
pleasant, safe, aud reliable family medicine,
FOR DYSPEPSIA they are Invaluable. f
J. T. Hayes.
Mexla, Texas, June 17,1882.
The Rev. Francis B. Harlowh, writing
from Atlanta. Qa., says: “For some years
past I have been subject to constipation,
from which, in spite of the use of medi-
cines of various kinds, I suffered increasing
Inconvenience, until some months ago 1
began taking Ayer’s Pills. They have
entirely corrected tho costive habit, and
have vastly improved my general health.’’
Ayer’s Cathartic Pills correct irregu-
larities of tho bowels, stimulate tho appe-
tite and digestion, and by their prompt and
thorough action give tone and vigor to tho
whole physical economy.

“His Heart was True to Poll.”
Up in Queensland there is a young man
who was born with his heart in the right side of
his body. Soon after his advent on this mundane
ball, his doting parents, who were poor, having
discoveied the peculiarity, joined hands and cir-
cled around the cradle, while visions ot wealth
accrued from side-showhexhibitions of their phe-
noraenon floated through tho atmosphere. The
child grew and prospered just like a common
youngster, and you wouldn't have known that
anything was wrong with it. But a change came
over the scene. There was trouble in the house-
hold for a time; and, as in the ease of the naughty
child who stole tho preserves, there was a woman
at the bottom of it. The young man fell in love
with one of his neighbour’s daughters, and for the
first time in his life he felt that there was some-
thing wrong with his anatomy. The girl recipro-
cated the feeling; but her parents raised such a
row that the young man didn’t know whether he
was a-foot or a-horsoback. His heart, .too, com-
menced to assert itself, and began to move
mysteriously across his body at about tho rate
Moses piloted the Children of Israel through
the 1 great desert. Of course this anatomical
transition msCe him sick, and for a time his
life was despaired of. The attending physician
said that the only cure was to wean him from his
girl, as it was love that had disarranged the normal
conditions of his interior arrangements, and made
him the wreck that he was. So the girl was sent
to Sydney, for the old folks, who forgot how young
and foolish they once were themselves, thought
that absence would cure both tho swain and the
swainee. As might bo expected, the young man’s
heart continued on its way across his system, he
sank lower and lower, while the maiden was crazed
with grief. Finally, she got a letter stating that
her lover could not possibly live another week as
his heart was fast approaching perihelion, and ho
would then be a gone gosling. In sheer despera-
tion she threw herself on the tram track, and tho
cow-catcher threw her Into Hyde Park. She was
not killed, but she looked like a left-handed wheel-
barrow that had been struck by lightning. The
sanguinary cowcatcher had done its cruel work.
One of her eyes was found in Woolloomooloo, and
her left ear was carried away by a vagabond dog.
Through the skilful diagnosing of the night porter
at the hospital, she was nursed back to life; and
when she got able to be around, she found that
her lover had recovered. The first time he saw
her he felt a good deal like Jacob when, on the
morning after his first wedding, ho discovered
that ho had been put off with the wrong wife. But
the young man was game. He said: “ I promised to
love and cherish her while 1 lived, and I’m not the
white-livered Judas to go back on my word. I’ll
marry her like a man.” And he did; for, don’t
you see, the transformation of his anatomy was
complete, and his heart was in the right place.
Some time ago, one of Chiarini’s lions
happened to get loose, and commenced to make a
light repast off one of the other show animals.
They saturated a sponge with chloroform, and
held It to his nose on a long pole. The lion’s con-
duct was very interesting. He gave his meal one
look, just like a man would look who struck a
piece of a brass padlock in the middle of a saus-
age, and then he lay back in the sleep of Innocence.
Hello Muster Stooat! The Academy, a
London weekly says:—“ Mr. Furnivall, as director
of the New Shakspere Society, has received an
amusing offer from New South Wales. A gentle-
man there has, after seven years’ search, dis-
covered not only the well-known Historical char-
acter who wrote all Shakspeare’s plays and poems,
hut the very month and spot In which eleven of
the plays were written, and the probable date and
locality in which the rest were composed, the
author’s object in writing them, and the historical
characters and events meant by the dramatic ones;
and he can show that our Royal family is descended
from Perdita. He asks £30,000 for his descoveries.”
We sincerely trust the New Shakspeare Society
will not allow such a paltry trifle as £30,000 to pre-
vent from accepting this moderate offer. But
what a sly old fox Illawawa Stooat must bo to have
kept this back so long. If It had been the poetic
’Enry, we could have understood the silence as
arising from professional jealousy.
A Melbourne reviewer, speaking of the
late Mr. Buckle, author of the “ History of Civi-
lisation,” says “ he sailed over the field of know-
ledge as upon the eagle’s pinion.” Now, that is
news. The life and works of this philosopher are
now being widely discussed in Rome and Berlin,
and the leading writers have been unanimous In
their praise of our countrymen, but not one of
them nos gone so far as this. If we had been told
that he soared like a butterfly through the granite
strata of speculation, or had bicycled along like a
fish through the rough metal bf science, or even
drained the pewter of history like a Redfern
navvy, we should not disagree. But this sail-
ing over a field without telling us what cargo
he had aboard, or how he coaled, is too much.
Buckle was an English gentleman and renowned
chess player; rather feeble in health, had a private
library of 20,000 volumes, and died of fever some-
where in the East—Damascus, we believe. He was
scarcely 40, and his deliberate abandonment of a
portion of his vast undertaking is one of the most
touching passages in any English writer.
George Ingham hadn’t been to Melbourne
before. He started down, however, last week. He
had heard much of the great capital. Some even-
ing newspapers had reached him, and a copy of
the proceedings of the Presbyterian assembly had
crossed his path,.so he believed he understood the
idiosyncrasies of the town very well. He knew It
was both moral and respectable and determined
that he would prove himself worthy of It in both
respects. So, as soon as the train stopped at the
Spencer-street station, he stepped out on the plat-
form and took his trousers off. This brought a
bobby out of a profound slumber and ho took
George away with him. The Bench thought
George insane, and remanded him for examina-
tion. Now, it is extremely likely that ho is not
Insane at all, but is a keen satirist. Looking to his
sources of Information about Melbourne, and fol-
lowing the way society is made clean down there,
what could be in better keeping than that George
—who wished to look decent in a pair of new trou-
sers—should take off the old ones in the centre of
the platform ?
Barrister Gaunt wants the sphere of his
Sosslble labours to he considerably enlarged,
eckett, the fireman of an engine that came to
grief on the Warrenheip railway line, was de-
graded by his superior officers to the post of
cleaner. Against this he appealed to the new
Commissioners, and Mr. Gaunt presented himself
at the Board in his interest. In whose interest—
Gaunt’s or Beckett’s ?—Both. The commissioners,
however, maintained they were merely an execu-
tive body, and asked Mr. Gaunt to pick up his
black bag and hook It. The commissioners stated
that they didn’t want their office to be turned into
a courthouse with all the jangle and clamour,
which means additional expense to the party
wanting justice, with very little additional chance
of getting it. But Mr. Gaunt observed that they
were receiving evidence on oath, and were, in fact
In the legal position of a court of appeal, and as-
serted that he would fetch the lot before the
Supreme Court. If Barrister Gaunt wins, there
will be a fine new territory added to the present
area over which the legal mind so profitably pre-
vails.
They are having a mighty dry time of it
In Wilcannia. Already the town, which has a
population of several thousand souls, is scant of
tS-ovislons, and there Is no likelihood of rain in
that district short of two or three months. Prices
are already beyond the usually high rate, and will
rise week by week. Potatoes would readily fetch
from £35 to £40 a ton. Bread is Is. 4d. the 41b loaf,
and from the scarcity of flour is likely to rise to 2s.
Condensed milk, the only kind procurable, is Is 9d.
atin, whilst the retailprlce in Sydney or Melbourne
Is 8d. The few vegetables that can be go t from the
Chinese are six times as high as in the cities. As
for fruit, it cannot be procured at any price.
Chaff for horse-feed cannot be procured even
at £35 and £40 per ton, as the few holders
refuse to sell at any price. Owing to
the want of grass and herbage, the horses
on all the malt routes have to he stable-fed,
and the supply of chaff, now at the lowest
ebb, cannot he replenished before a rise In the
river, which may not occur for four or five
months. The probabilities aro therefore that the
mails will soon have to be discontinued. Alto-
gether, tho prospect is of tho gloomiest descrip-
tion, and nothing but the weekly visit of The
Bulletin sustains the people and nerves them to
look their troubles in the face.
Patrick Joseph Murphy, a Frenchman of
the old regime, and of an age at which his eye-
teeth are, if ever they will he, cut, found himself
recently in Melbourne. That was bad. But he
found himself also without a wife. That was
worse. To ho in Melbourne, and without a wife,
constitute the ne plus ultra of human misery. If
Patrick wei'e not a Frenchman he would have lost
heart. He would have swallowed a gallon of beer,
lain down, and let the policeman carry him on a
shutter to the lock-up. But the proud Gallic
blood surged through the veins of Patrick. It
surged through Patrick, and he got up and looked
about him. What did he see ? He saw Mary Cur-
tain. What did he say ? He said : “ Begorra,
Mary, I like ye. Will ye buckle?” What did
Mary say ? She said : “ Begorra, Patrick, here’s
at ye.” What did ho do? He went to the Rev.
Robert Scott, of Chalmer’s Church, and got mar-
rled. What did he pay ? He paid the Rev. Rjbert
with an order for a guinea, on Nlppard, of the
Railway Club Hotel. But the Rev. Robert found
the order was valueless, and gave it to the police.
And Patrick was shoved in. And then it was
found that he already possesses a wife and family
in Sydney. But the proud Gallic blood surged again
through the veins of Patrick,and he now propounds
these conundrums : “ The fee is an essential part
of the rite. The deuce a fee I paid. Therefore
the rite is wrong. Therefore I didn’t marry Mary
legally.” But he is kept there at present to beat
out his proud spirit against the prison bars.
Ah, ha! “ Cry Hmoc, and let slip the dogs
of war.” Also give the police a clue that will lead
them to suspect who the incarnate fiend we are
about to allude to is; start the Wolverene on
wheels to bombard the district; order out the
whole of our brave army of 3000 officers and 17
men to scour the country with fire and sword, and
thus wipe out the sanguinary blot that now so
foully stains our colony’s fair escutcheon. Read
further on, and shud-dar-r-h as you read. The
MMogll maniac who troubles the readers of
ooze now yells: “I am informed that one of
our residents, Mrs. Edwards, had 40 of her ducks
nolsoned last week by some mean, malicious per-
son. The unprincipled individual who perpe-
trated this crime deserves three months’ hard
labour. We hope the stern hand of justice will
yet he able to do its work.” Good Lud I Can such
revolting crimes be committed in a land so civil-
ised, fair, and yet so young ? With that wonderful
perception which is Alfred's chief characteristic
(next to his appetite), that distinguished journalist
lays us on to the straight tsack at once in a
“ Brevity ” par., which says: “ There’s a wretch at
large in the Paterson district poisoning the settlers
ducks. Perhaps it’s the Sydney stabbing man
broken out in a new placel” That’s it, Alfred. All
you want now is a stack of Police Gazettes, a
night entrance, and a loaded whip-handle to be a
whole detective department in yourself. Beyond
all doubt, it was the Sydney stabber who poisoned
Mrs. Edwards’ ducks with two score of Yankee
Novelty jack-knives.
At the Sydney Hospital there is an ar-
rangement (little Renwlck’s own words are our
authority) made by the house surgeon, in accord-
ance with which the night porter, if he considered
a case to be of a serious character, awakened the
medical officer and brought him to it at once; if
the case were of a less important character, the
night porter told the doctor so, and tho latter
dressed himself properly before going to the
lodge. It la only natural to suppose that the night
porter Is a duly qualified medical man, otherwise
the arrangement made between him and the house
surgeon is certainly a most objectionable one. An
urgent case comes to a hospital. The night porter
diagnoses it, and if it he serious he hurries the
doctor along; if not, he allows him time to dress
properly (one doctor, by the bye, can t dress him-
self in twenty-five minutes). All depends upon
the correctness of the night porter s diagnosis .
Either the medical officer should be called the
night porter’s assistant (and paid accordingly), or
the night porter should be called the medical
officer—which he virtually is, since upon his dictum
it rests whether the case shall be treated as serious
or not. The difference between the time allowed
by the night porter to the house surgeon for a
non-serious case and that to which (had he sup-
posed it serious) he would have limited him for
dressing purposes, may just possibly, upon some
occasion, when the night porter’s diagnosis has been
inaccurate— for even night porters are not Infal-
lible—result in a manslaughter; and then we shall
have little Kenwick and his crowd “ Who’d have
thought it!” The “case” should be dressed, first;
where this is not done, the dilatory medico should
be “ dressed down.”
Colonel Sargood, the Victorian Softgoods
Minister for War, having got a lot of soldiers, sat
down and began to think in what sort of duds he
would robe them. Shape and texture were easily
disposed of, but colour constituted a grave diffi-
culty. “ I’ll not choose scarlet,” mused he. That
decision is regretable. People have got used to
thinking of soldiers as apparitions in scarlet, and
nurse girls in particular have dreamed and dreamed
of the oriiliant hue until their own cheeks blushed
in rivalry. It is likely also owing to the colour of
the martial uniform that our dominions are so
studded with dazzling, meteoric redheads. But
there was reason in the Colonel’s di clsion. “ Scar-
let is too good a mark for the enemy.” That
settles it. Better for Victoria to have its soldiers
a little less attractive and wholesomely alive.
After all the trouble and expense of raising them,
it would be recklessly absurd to let them get
killed. “And I’ll not choose blue,” mused the
Colonel. And there was reason also in that de-
cision. The Colonel likes contrast between the
colour of their uniforms and the colour of their
looks, and believes that if their uniforms were
blue, their looks would, when the noise of battle
sounded, be of such a hue that a whole battalion
would present the appearance of a gigantic blue-
bag. “I’ll choose a light brown,” mused the
Colonel. And again, the reason for this decision is
good .“Tho enemy won’t see them so easily,” says
the Colonel. This is a polite compliment not alone to
the valour of the heroic militia, but also in a
general, if insiduous way, to the great family of
the colonial Browns. It’s a bid for the sympathies
of every Brown in the south. But, after all, it
may be pardonable to ask the Colonel why he did
not choose green. Green is a very nice colour,
indeed. It is true that the objection urged against
blue applies to it, but only to an extremely insig-
nificant extent. The militiaman’s whole features
would be, if he entered the battlefield, susceptible
of the blue tinge, but it is only the corner of his
eye that would carry a little green in it. That s
one point. And then the reason which set aside
scarlet is just another reason in support of green
—or of one of the varieties of it. For instance,
invisible green. Now, just fancy the surprise of
the cruel devastating enemy, swooping down on
the Victorian capital with boxes of vestas and
double-bladed tobacco-knives, and finding the
tripe shops guarded by motionless phalanxes ot
invisible greens I No doubt, it the strategic
colonel will review the matter, he will see a
strategic kernel in this reflection.

The “ Spanish ” hood is made of black Spanish lace
and ribbon, and falls in graceful folds round the neck,
where it is gathered together by a ribbon bow. This
hood is so contrived as to avoid crushing the hair
whether dressed high or low.
