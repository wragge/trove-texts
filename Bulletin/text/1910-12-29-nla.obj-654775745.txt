IRISH.
Irish !
Can’t you hear her callin',
Is that you, Irish t
From under her old sunbonnet
With the dew o’ dawn fresh on it.
That a golden-green bough gave her.
When she stepped out all into the misty mornin’.
And a butterfly upon it.
That, moth-like, cannot leave her,
Is that you, Irish ?
Oh!
Oh, it’s I that am a little brown boy
When I hear her dear voice callin’,
Over the wet grass, like a bare-foot joy,
Runnin’ all across the golden mornin’.
Is that you , mad Irish ?
Oh, it’s mad am I, an’ it’s you that make me.
An’ I break down boughs when the rages take me,
An’ I feel the blue sky failin’—
For my blood’s all Irish,
Oh !
Oh, her little brown fingers
An’ her brown face, soft an’ soft.
An’ her voice, like water failin’.
Where the world’s lost music lingers, lingers,
Callin’,
Irish, aren't you cornin', Irish ?
O, but they all possess me !
Could I come faster, a bright, bird flyin’ ?
An’ it’s come would I if I lay dyin’
An’ a priest by, to confess me !
Oh!
What did you come for , Irish ?
Rose-heart, darlin’, hear the bees hummin’,
It’s they for the blossom, an’ mo for you coinin’;
An’ now you’ll distress me
With butter-sweet teasin’
An’ brown eyes, displeasin’
Of a wild Irish boy !
Oh, Irish, !
Oil !

Anti - Mirandelay
li. 0. McKayl rise and object violently to
the mirandelay. In the first place, it is net a
combination of the reversolet and glose at all,
but merely a glose with the first verse re-
peated backwards. To combine the rever-
solet and glosfe properly is a simple matter,
merely calling for the building-up of a glose
capable of reversal after the last line of the
first verse has stood its turn as verse-leader.
Such a form is, of course, essentially limit-
ing and artificial, owing to the monotony of
the repetition ; but it has a much more com-
pleted effect than the mirandelay, as the fol-
lowing dreadful example will show. (I pur-
loin the “Red Page’s” Latin perversion
without the slightest apology)
RE VE RSOGLOSOLETTE.
(More in sorrow than in anirer.)
“O Tempora , 0 Mores, O'Dowd!!!’’
I doubt if lie knows, and I sigh
From the depths of the heart, chanting loud
“You have dredged the whole Mystic World
dry ! ”
(I doubt if he knows, and I sigh
To the tune of my rhythmical text
As I pause for the poet’s reply)
“ Please write of some Real things next,
“From the depths of the heart! Chanting loud
You write of caste, Buddha—and worse—
And the veil of a mystical cloud
Throw over your symbolist verse.
“ You have dredged the whole Mystic World dry?
Well, write of the Simple and True !
Drop ‘Sophia’s ’ weird flight through the sky
For the real that is waiting for you !
“Throw over your symbolist verse,
And the veil of a mystical clc-ud
You write of ! Cast Buddha, and worse,
From the depths of the heart! Chanting loud
“ Please write of some Real things next 1”
As I pause for the poet’s reply
To the tune of my rhythmical text,
I doubt if he knows; and I sigh.
“ You have dredged the whole Mystic World dry
From the depths ! ” (Of the heart-chanting loud
I doubt if he knows ; and I sigh :
‘ O Tempora ! O Mores ! ! O’ Dowd !!!’)”
This is a glose, because the first four lines
supply the leading lines of the first four
verses ; it is a reversed glose, because the
last three lines supply the ending lines of
the last three verses ; and it is a reversolet
in that the last three verses are the first
three verses written backwards. Certainly
it possesses a “ middle ” ; but then, so did
the convict in the story, and pace the ‘ ‘ Red
Page’s ” strictures on this feature of the form
when the reversolet competition was “on,”
I prefer my Muse, when dressed in reverso-
let garb, to show hints of a waist.
* •***•
“ McKay’s Reversolet . . . the very thing
to express in form the descent and ascent of
the soul.” Thus I read, and reading it grew
sad. And I wandered into Professor Tomb-
turner’s seance ; and I called upon the shade
of convict John Henry Smith of immortal
memory. Lo, there was a clanking of chains,
and the next moment there hovered before
me the inventor of the reversolet himself,
dressed in flaming stripes and broad arrows
that smelt of phosphorus. I regret that the
mere mention of the word mirandelay caused
the shade to give vent to such a volley of
early Victorian oaths that the circle broke up
in utter confusion ; but on regaining the
street there fluttered toward me out of the
ether a slip of faded paper. I seized it
eagerly. It proved to be an unpaid laundry-
bill, on the back of which was scribbled in a
band tremulous and shaky from inexpressible
emotion :
“By the mouldy Melbourne law-courts, lookin’
sideways to the sea,
There’s a frenzied bard a-settin’, and I know he
thinks o’ me:
For the Norms are in his brain cells, an’ the tram-
car-bells, they say,
‘Shape a dream, O Keltic hormone, shape a mild
Mirandelay—
' Shape a mild Mirandelay
Where the co-respondents stray—
Can’t yon '’ear the lawyers gloatin’ o’er your
weird Mirandelay?
On the road to M’randelay
Where the flyin’ adverbs play,
An’ O’Dowd comes up in wouder out o’ Chaos,
’crosc the bay I ’
“ I seen ’im first a-dreamin’ with an index by his
side,
A Reversolet (’e pinched it) an’ a Close wot
nearly died,
An’ ’e wed ’em (in ’is brain-cells) in the Christian
Science way—
An’ their orfspring was an ’arf-caste, which ’e
called * Mirandelay.’
“ ’Er petticoat was Symbols, an’ ’er little cap was
Guff,
An’ ’er verbal skirt was ’obble, an’ was trimmed
with mystic fluff;
An’ ’er arm around ’is shoulder, an’ ’is ’air agin
’er combs.
They useter watch the law-clerks an’ the ushers
pilin’ tomes.
Ushers sad a-pilin’ tomes
To the gloomy grimy domes.
Where the phrasin’ ’ting that ’eavv it was worse
nor Bernard’s pomes !
On the road to M’randelay ....
“ But that’s all shoved be’hind ’im, long ago ’an
far away,
For ’e sent ’er to the ‘ Red Page ’ ; yes, ’e sold
Mirandelay !
For they’re learnin’ up in Sydney wot the Argus
critic tells—
If you’ve ’card O’Dowd a-callin’ you won’t never
read nought else.
No, you won’t read nothin’ else
But, them icy Gnostic spells,
An’ the moonshine an’ the Peptones an’ ’is Moral
parallels !
On the road to M’randelay. ...”
[ls the inventor of the reversolet gnashing
his teeth at the thought of missing the
O’Dowclian invention ? The mirandelay may
not be the best possible combination of the
glose and the reversolet, but it is O’Dowd’s
mirandelay.]
By Australian Writers
The wise reader never skips a preface, for
writers often unburden themselves there or
state their purpose in a few lines. A. Need-
ham says on the front page of The Radi-
cals and Other Verse (Daily Post, Hobart) :
Some scathing verse on human wrong
Was now the burden of my song ;
My anger blazed ’gainst tyranny —
I wrote for Light and Liberty.
This song was rough and bold and crude,
For I was in a fevered mood.
My brave Parnassian music died
Because it lacked a human stride,
My rugged lines were lightning darts
That kindled hope in many hearts.
There you have a reasonably accurate de-
scription of these honest, manly verses
dedicated to the derelicts and the “ bottom
dogs ” of society.
Again, on opening Petals in the I find, a
booklet of verses by Mrs. Helen Jerome, the
male reader meets a modest foreword which
puts him in the right mood for appreciating
the contents :
“Nowadays we build our little villas of prose
and rhyme and stand at the open windows to be
seen of those who pass.” These little villas of
verse may cause a smile in places; in others a
sigh. For the smile and the sigh there is always
someone in the world who will blow a kiss in
imagination. No one knows better than the
writer how far from the poetic field is this little
terrace of villas. But at least do not call them
suburban ! And again at least, believe that there
is a little inhabitant within each dwelling who is
not always standing before the window.
That would be very pretty but for the im-
possibility of reconciling “ petals ” with
“villas.” “Petals” they are, blown from
the flowering of many moods—most of which
were cynical. Look at this one :
A glance—a subtle something
Between a maid and man ;
The curtain rang up slowly
And then the play began.
Upon the stage the Devil
Stepped gracefully between
Twk> souis that sought each other.
The Devil smiled—unseen.
The mouth of her was very sweet.
Her soul he sought—unwise !
The Devil skipped across the stage
And threw dust in his eyes.
It is only fair to the Devil to say that
Mother Nature does the dust-throwing busi-
ness as a steady thing for her own ends, and
treats both sexes impartially.
“ Failure ” closes with these lines ;
And whispering gods are knocking at my heart
To bid me only sing of things I dream.
If Mrs. Jerome tried to inscribe the dainty
petals'with her dreams they might sing splen-
didly as they floated down the wind. . . She
writes well, and is at her best in “ The Law ”
and “The Mother Woman.” Her little
book is worth more than the Is. asked for it.

The Rime of the Bunyip and Other Verse,
by Henry Tate (G. Robertson and Co.) con-
tains four grotesques :
The wind was bin inly smooshtering
Along the swithering wooves
And the Beebah booled defiance
To the Bunyip in hisbrooves.
The Bunyip answered brufously
And scrittled in his skin.
His whiskers grew skewbifferous.
His tail trvbersferin.
“ Jabberwocky ” is indigestible stuff in
large doses, and it would have been better if
Tate had left out half of these grotesques.
His “ballades” are unorthodox in form,
and some lines are clumsy :
Through the dark-beaming cool of oozy deeps
The passionate heart of love his voice unbars.
“The Bounding Kangaroo,” “The Candle”
and “ Wireless ” are the best of the verses.
To the average landsman it does not matter
much whether the details in a nautical yarn
arc correct or not so long as the story sails
ahead in good style. The usual captain
might cry out “ Stand by to furl the binnacle
and take a reef in the main fore t’ gallant
stuns’l,” and the same old viperish mate
might amuse himself by prodding lubbers
with a belaying pin, and they would pass
muster with most readers who have never
been to sea. J. A. Barry, a master mariner and
able writer, gives the sea and ships accurately.
11 is latest collection, Sea Yarns (Sydney
Book Club), has nine leisurely and interest-
ing stories of sailormen and one of bush-
ranging.
♦-
It isn’t often that we Australians see our-
selves described by the stranger within our
gates with either intelligence or much toler-
ance, or, again, with much of that insight
which comes to the worker in any country.
In Sous, la Croix du Sud (Paris, Libraire
Plon) Paul Wenz shows that he has all
these and a capacity to write a very decent
story besides. Whatever length of time he
has spent in N.S.W., he certainly knows
“Banjo’s” country well, and a literal
translation of any of these stories
would leave undeceived any Bulletin reader
as to the nationality of its author. The
“ Cockatoo ” is a conventional sheep-stealing
yarn, and the “ Jaekeroo ” gentleman once,
like Jim Carew, has a familiar ring : but
“ La Butte des Becs-Cuillers ” (the Hut of
the Spoonbills) might have been written
by Maupassant, and the humorous sketch
of the rise and fall of “ Gooburra-
ganderong,” or “Son Chien,” resembles
the work of Henry Lawson a decade back.
Not that the work of Paul Wenz suggests
a second-hand inspiration; he is clearly
a man of some experience who writes after
the event—but that there is in Lawson some-
thing of the pure Gallic mind, its fine clarity,
its desire for incisive characterisation. We
could very well do with a few writers
of English as capable as Paul Wenz. One
thing we can congratulate ourselves upon :
he will give his French audience a very faith-
ful picture of the rougher side of Australian
life and character.—L.L.
The Cave Woman in Silk Petti-
coats
It is refreshing to meet the primitive
woman in a present-day environment.
Though figuring as an attractive English
widow, and practising as an artist in Paris,
Aregonde Byrne in Maude Annesley’s Wind
Along the Waste is still the original Cave
Woman, as drawn by Dulcie Dearner and
others. Her raw emotions, flavored with
Umar Khayyam, are dished up with great
zest by Mrs. Annesley.
“ Gronda ” scorned her meek lovers and
threw herself at the gigantic captain of a
band of Parisian Apaches who robbed her.
At first he was her model, then her lover,
then —
“No ! Pm not your dog, to be ordered to come
and go at your pleasure ! I ivorit give you up. . . .
To be made love to by a thief—to be kissed by a
thief—that was interesting, n’est-ce pas? A new
sensation in your blase existence ! And Pin to
pay the penalty, am I? . . . I’m to—where are
you going? ”
“I must be alone—l can’t bear it; I must
think.”
“Stay where you are!” he commanded. . . .
Then he lifted his arm and struck at her blindly.
She fell like a log. . . .
After a few moments she raised herself on her
elbow and looked at him. .. . Then, still looking
at him, she rose painfully to her feet. . . and
moved slowly across the room. . . .
After a little while he murmured humbly, close
to her ear : “ I’m sorry, my woman; my woman,
I’m sorry.”
“ I’m glad,” she said, quietly. “It has brought
me to my senses. You are my master. Do with
me what you will.”
A woman like Aregonde deserves adventures,
and she gets them. Impossible, may be,
yet she herself, though unusual, is real
enough—the mouthpiece in fiction of a
vague, feminine dissatisfaction with the
civilising process which, while busily re-
straining the ape and tiger, has allowed the
tame cat to flourish. Mrs. Jerome voices a
similar feeling in Petals .in the Wind :
Why do I love you? Because you’re my Mate,
Because you’re my man and I love the brute
strength of you,
Primeval woman am I at my best.
(Also, do I know how to keep my small foot on
you !)
Why do I love you ? Now haven’t you guessed ?
♦
The meaning of “The Finer Grain,’’
according to Henry James, is “a peculiar
accessibility to surprise, to curiosity, to mys-
tification, or attraction.” If you are of the
right grain, you will rejoice in the live stories
contained in The Finer Grain (Methuen).
They are hardly stories in the ordinary
sense ; they are just Henry James, and very
good James.
* * * *
Edith Wharton’s Tales of Men and Ghosts
(Macmillan) can be read and appreciated even
by people of coarse grain. The ghostly ele-
ment is not very thrilling. “Afterwards” has
all the mechanism but not the atmosphere of a
good ghost story. The studies of men, how-
ever, are acute and finely presented. “ His
Father’s Son,” is one of the best —the story
of a business-man who put all the romance
of his life into letters written for his wife to
a Russian musician, and then doted on the
incarnation of that romance in his son.
Edith Wharton is more English in style than
Gertrude Atherton, and writes better short
stories than any other woman living.
* * * *
To the casual eye, it would be a thousand
to one against such a candidate as this win-
ning stolid British votes :
His face was lividly pale, and from beneath two
finely-arched eyebrows blazed a pair of intensely
blfck eyes. His physiognomy was strictly
Jewish. Over a broad high forehead were ring-
lets of coal-black glossy hair, which, combed away
from his right temple, fell in luxuriant clusters or
bunches over his left cheek and ear, which it
entirely concealed from view. He was very
showily attired in a dark bottle-green frock-coat,
a waistcoat of a most extravagant pattern, the
front almost covered with glittering chains, and
in fancy-pattern pantaloons.
Everyone will recognise the man—the
young Disraeli, “ the wondrous boy who
wrote Alro}/,” and stood for Parliament “on
his head,” the curled and oiled darling who,
for the first time, made affectation trumps
and won the game.
The story of the incomparable Dizzy has
been told in brief many times ; his epigrams
are in most dictionaries of quotations ; and
now the full official biography is coming from
the hands of VV. F. Monypenny. Vol. I,
just issued, takes the reader from 1814 to
1837, when Dizzy had just been elected to
the Commons.
The Rationalist Press Association sends The
B. P. A. Annual for 1911, containing articles by
Hiram Maxim—“ Wanted, an Anti-Missionary
Society”; Joseph McCabe—“The Secret Philo-
sophy of Mark Twain,” and others. Also Leeky’s
History of Rationalism in Europe, unabridged, at
Is. net; and Haeckel’s Confession of Faith at fid.
So many copies of A Message to Garcia have
been printed tiiat you could pave a footpath with
them on which Elbert Hubbar'd might take the
Message to Mars. If any Australian has not yet
read the famous document which exhorts you to '
buck up and work honest for the boss, he or she
can now get it in a specially authorised Austra-
lian edition published by S. J. Eudacott, of Mel-
bourne (Cole’s Book Arcade).
The French are discovering Australia. A book
by A. Metin on Le Socialisme Sans Doctrines —
Australia and N.Z. (Paris, F. Alcorn) gives a
very fair account of our experiments in Social-
ism. The October number of Mcrcure de France
has the first of two or more critical articles on the
work of Henry Lawson. Not long ago we men-
tioned that Les Nouvclles Nouvellcs printed a
translation of one of Lawson’s stories with an
appreciative note. Paul Wenz is writing Austra-
lian stories for French readers, and there are
others.
R. S. Ross: The Bomb, by Frank Harris, by
some caprice of letters has won but little notice,
though published in 1908. To me it is a remark-
able novel. It purports to be the autobiography
of one of the Chicago anarchists of 1886—the one
who threw the bomb and escaped. The real in-
wardness of agitatory phenomena has never been
depicted better. The Bomb clutches at you. It is
all sombre. It is proletarian pathos and tragedy.
It is primeval in its background of social savagery.
There is no laughter in the book, but there is love
and a man’s titanic struggle against the elemental
force of desire.
“ A good paradox is better than true—it is sug-
gestive. Whereas an ordinary truth is a view
down a street, a good paradox is a view down a
street and round a corner.”—A. Esdaile, in an
article on “The New Hellenism ” of Oscar Wilde

HEARNE’S
Bronchitis Cure
The Grandest Remedy in the World for
COUGHS & COLDS
ONE DOSE IS GENERALLY SUFFICIENT.
THOSE who have taken this medicine are amazed at
its splendid healing power. Sufferers from Bron-
chitis, Cough, Croup, Asthma, Hoarseness, Difficulty
of Breathing, Pain or Soreness 'in the Chest, experience
delightful and rapid relief; and to those who are subject
to Colds on the Chest it is invaluable, as it effects a
complete cure. It is most comforting in allaying Irrita-
tion in the Throat and giving Strength to the Voice,
and it neither allows a Cough or Asthma to become
chronic, nor Consumption to develop. Consumption is
not known where “Coughs” have, on their first appear-
ance, been properly treated with this
medicine. No house should be without LARGE
it, as, taken at the beginning, a dose or SIZE :
two is generally sufficient, and a com-
plete cure is certain.

A Leading Publicist and Criminologist
and Justice of the Peace says there is
no Medicine to equal Clements Tonic.
“ I Speak from Personal Experience of its Merits.”
Mr. Albert Sydney Watson, M.A., LL.B., J.P., who gives
this Clements Tonic testimony, was recently a sitting Magistrate
for Queensland ; also J. P. for South Australia, and recently
directed the Aviation Exhibition in Adelaide. He founded and
was secretary of the Discharged Prisoners’ Aid Society of New
Zealand, and on his departure was presented with an illuminated
address, signed by the Chief Justice, the Stipendiary Magistrate,
the visiting Justice of the Prisons, the Mayor of Wellington,
Members of Parliament, etc., in recognition of his organising
services. The Government of the Australian States have always
been glad of his opinion on their prison systems (vide newspaper
reports). He is Director of the Progress Advertising Agency
Propy., Ltd., Melbourne, and directly associated with other
large businesses. He writes as follows :
“ 368 Bourke Street, Melbourne,
“November 6, 1910.
“ CLEMENTS TONIC, LTD.
“Undoubtedly Clements Tonic is the standard
remedy of Australia. There is no imported medicine
to equal it, and nothing manufactured in Australasia
to be mentioned in the same breath with it. It has
the most powerful possible tonic and recuperative
properties, while at the same time it is a perfectly safe
remedy, and may be used by old and young alike. I
have proved the value of this medicine, and hence
speak from personal experience of its merits. You
may use this as you think fit.
“(Signed) ALBERT S. WATSON,
“ M.A., LL.B., of U.S.A.”
«,
Very many persons who have used CLEMENTS TONIC, and have
been entirely cured of their ailments, declare that to have this remedy
in the house is to be ensured against ill-health. They write thus to the
proprietors, therefore it is wise for everyone to keep it, because here are
three effects of its use:—(1) It makes the liver active ; (2) the heart
regular ; (3) the nerves sound as steel. If these vital functions are kept
in this order, you keep well. All Chemists and Stores sell it everywhere.


A Tonic Free from
Alcohol
Are you pale, weak, easily tired,
and do you lack nerve power?
Ask your doctor if Ayer's Sar-
saparilla would not be good for
you. He knows, end will ad-
vise you wisely. Not a drop of
alcohol in this medicine. It
puts red corpuscles into the
blood, gives steady, even power
to the nerves; and all without
stimulation. Make no mistake.
Take only those medicines the
best doctors endorse. Ask your

WHY Suffer From
This Dread
Affliction?
A FEW years ago, unless you
underwent a surgical operation
you had no hope of obtaining reliet
if you suffered from Varicose Veins
in the legs.
To-day, owing to the great strides
in science, not only may you obtain,
painless relief but you can obtain an
absolute cure for your trouble with-
out any inconvenience.
The Vecsey Method of
Treatment is a perfectly pain-
less, external treatment that at once
alleviates the pain caused by Vari-
cose Veins and then rapidly reduces
and ultimately entirely restores the
vein to a normal state without laying
up or detention from business.
(Consultation
FREE.
If you suffer from Varicose Veins or
Ulcers come in and see our chief consul-
tant. He will explain our method of cure
and will give you all particulars of this
wonderful treatment. No fees for enter-
views or advice.

BE SURE YOU GET
BOIMNINGTON’S
IRISH MOSS.
Most chemists and retailers will give you
Bonnington’s Irish Moss directly you ask for it.
Here and there, however, you will find one who
does not maintain the dignity of the profession,
and who will try to sell you a substitute, on
which he makes a larger profit. You know the
insidious argument, “Yes, I stock Bonningtons; but have you tried my own
mixture It is ‘just as good.’”
Allow no one to deceive you. There is no remedy so good as Bonnington s
Irish Moss.
FOR THE CHEST. THROAT AND LUNGS.
Try it the next time you have a cold, and you will be satisfied.

VARIOVS VERSE
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Autumn.
The roses are gone by, and the flowers droop and
die,
And the chill of autumn flames the poplar tree ;
And the skies are grey above, without hint of
warmth or love,
And a grey mist lies upon the sea.
There are sighs in all the air, for the fields are
bleak and bare,
And the summer’s done and folded all away.
Can the bird have heart to sing on a sorrow-laden
wing
The song of a sun-lighted day ?
We heard the rising lark when the hours were
small and dark,
We watched the shimmering light on land and
sea ;
We drank the joy of noon, and at rising of the
moon
The rose breathed its sweets for you and me.
Ah, our sighings all are vain, and remembered
joys are pain
While the dying year goes out in fading gleams,
And who shall wake anew the lost tenderness so
true
Of daffodils, and crocus-light, and dreams?
MAORILAND.
DAVID McKEE WRIGHT.
Mountain Arithmetic.
This is a song of gladness,
A song of one, two, three;
Ethel went to the mountains
Playing gooseberree.
Up where the Leura splashes
Wandered the one and two,
Under the stars a-sparkle
High in the mountains blue.
Over the mountain pathways
One who had gone before
Found himself sad and lonely
Till two and two made four.
So this is a song of gladness,
A song of two and two,
Under the sun a-streaming
Over the mountains blue.
Two and two by the Leura,
Under the golden sun,
Changed by the mountain counting
To simple one and one.

Beach Brownies.
Green rollers tumble, white as milk,
On beaches guinea-gold,
And ocean’s deep-blue bosom
Heaves strangely as of old.
Beach Brownies, glad-limbed as young gods
Brown beach-girls, ocean-bred,
In blue and sea-green costumes
And girdles gold and red.
White gulls with whiter wave-crests flirt,
Cool winds blow from the south,
And the salt breath of ocean
Is sweet as true-love’s mouth.
In sea and sky a wondrous song.
In flesh and spirit health.
And love and youth and beauty.
To garner all earth’s wealth !
Gold sunbeams, wide, unblemished skies.
Amber and amethyst,
And ne’er a heart but singeth,
And ne’er a mouth unkissed.
Green combers—surf as white as.milk ;
Broad beaches strewn with gold ;
And tender eyes and dreamy,
And Love's sweet tale re-told.
Souls big as is the sea’s wild soul,
Mysterious, undivined ; 5
And hearts untamed as Nature’s,
And minds free as the wind.
A little while to dream, to grow
In knowledge, wisdom —then
A nation of sweet women,
A race of noble men !

Democracy.
They danced, they sang, they went their way
(How fair was life and good);
They did not hear him at his toil—
The Workman in the Wood.
Their silks and shoes were dainty wear,
Their hearts were all at ease ;
The earth was made to bring them joy,
The stars of Heaven to please.
Yet, blow on blow through noon and night,
And toiling ceaselessly,
The Workman smote with gleaming blade
Upon the Poison Tree.
There shall be shoes for all to wear,
And silken cap and gown,
And light and love and hearts at ease.
When he has hewed it down.
For he is great of soul and heart,
And great of thew is he;
His eyes are lit, his brows are lined,
His name—Democracy.

How to Address Letters.
Correspondents to Tim Bum.ktin would oblige the paver
(and, to an extent, themselves) by taking some care as to
methods of address.
Business letters (with regard to subscriptions, advertise-
ments, etc.) should in no case be addressed to the Editor,
but to the Manager. 'To send them to the Editor is to
invite inattention.
It is not a good thing to address editorial letters to
anyone by name. “ The Editor, Bum.ktin,” is the proper
superscription for “ copy.” Delay, and. even loss, is
sometimes caused by addressing to persons instead of
officials. The person may not be there; the official
always is.

lishers. The right to reproduce or translate any part of

dential.

BIG LOANS.
The new loan boom has arrived in earnest. Pre-
mier Verran, of S. A., whose case was specially
dealt with in The Bulletin three weeks ago, pro-
poses to borrow £6,807,000, though it won’t be
all done in one year —in fact, it would be impos-
sible to do it all in one year. In these days
that shy herbiverous animal Cohen must be
stalked carefully, as he feeds among the
long grasses, and approached gently. Premier
Kidston, of Queensland, proposes to borrow
£9,991,000 as early as posible, and has
already asked Parliament for authority to
raise £4,177,000. The McGowen Ministry in
N.S.W. intends to spend the almost incredible
borrowed amount of £4,933,000 during the current
year; and even Victoria’s John Weary has
drifted in with a Loan Bill amounting to
£2,475,593. With Westralia raising the wind as
usual, there can be no possible shadow of doubt
that the borrowing business is going strong.
Among all these financial profligates Kidston is
the only one who will have a big imposing job to
show for the money. Heis goingto carry the coastal
railway northward to Cairns, and to build that
remarkable narrow-gauge inland line from
south-east to north-west, which it is pro-
posed to bluff the Commonwealth into mak-
ing part of the new transcontinental. The
other Premiers have no big devices on hand.
They mean to spread their money around among
a multitude of small jobs and an illimitable catar-
act of repairs. In this matter Victoria’s John
Wbary puts up a specially disgraceful record.
His list of works includes the reconstruction or re-
placement, with borrowed money, of 46 old worn-
out railway stations which were built with bor-
rowed money, and a whole multitude of things of
that sort. In fact, £1,012,902 of his loan is to go in
railway repairs—the ones which should have been
charged to revenue, but weren’t for fear of spoil-
ing Tait’s beautiful surplus. The balance mostly
goes to pay for 19 little scraps of railway, all
pointing towards congested and overgrown Mel-
bourne and devised to drag all traffic there regard-
less of sense and convenience.
* * * *
But if the financial schemes of the Victorian
Treasurer are bad, those of Premier McGowen in
N.b.W. are worse. No one ever expected much
of John Weary; he is just Weary, and when
that is said everything is said. From McGowen,
on the other hand, a good deal was expected. He
represents a party which has long been pledged
not to borrow except for the renewal of old
loans, for the completion of works inherited
from its predecessors, and for new works which
will pay from the start full interest on their cost
and 1 per cent, sinking fund as well. That
is nothing very large or gorgeous in the way
of a programme of political honesty, but it
looked like something—or almost like something.
Now it looks like nothing. McGowen’s proposed
loan expenditure is worse than the worst outbreak
of Wade or Carruthkrs. Only £1,893,000 of it
stands for unfinished works which he inherited
from his predecessor, and the other £3,039,400 is
his own responsibility. That represents about the
most strenuous thing in its line that the State
has yet experienced. And the items are mostly
just the same old sort of items. There is not the
slightest sign of any attempt to restrict borrowing
to works which will pay full interest and 1 per
cent, sinking fund, and apparently that clause of
the party programme is a mere lie or sham
or disgraceful hypocrisy, designed to catch
the votes of the unwary. One item of the
loan proposals concerns a line from Hermidaie to
Nymagee, which is to start from a place of no
importance on a most unprofitable railway, and
run across a hideously dry region toa copper mine
which is a dead loss. (There is some kind of a
guarantee offered as regards the interest on the
cost of the work, but it is insufficient and quite
temporary, and it is a lamentable fact that guar-
antees are often very hard to collect, especially
from unfortunate enterprises in dry country.)
The Fassifern-Toronto tramway doesn’t look
promising. The proposal to charge to loans the
electrification of three outside steam tramways
which have already a huge annual deficit—one of
them doesn’t pay a copper of interest on its cost
and doesn’t even profess to cover working ex-
penses—is an outrage on political decency. Such
items as “Improvement of Observatory Hill,”
“ construction of works generally,” “closer settle-
ment, “metropolitan sewerage and stormwater
channels generally,” “ country towns sewerage
and stormwater channels,” “pumping machinery,”
“cottages for district turncocks,” “ country towns
water supplies,” and the like, are in the same
category ; not one of them is certain to earn full
interest and sinking fund, and most of them are
quite certain not to, and their inclusion in the
list shows a cynical disregard of truth and honor
that the worst “ Liberal ” Government would find
it hard to exceed.
* * * *
To put the matter shortly, theMcGowENGovern-
ment seems to go on the principle of charging to
loans everything that its predecessors would have
charged, and a few other things besides. Even
the paltry sum (£50,000) required for the proposed
State brickworks is to be borrowed if a certain
technical difficulty can be got over. Apparently
it is just assumed in advance that every old thing
that can possibly be built—even the alterations to
the tramway line that doesn’t cover its bill for
axle-grease—will pay full interest and 1 per cent,
over, and if it doesn’t—well, presumably the
simple explanation will be that it should have
done so anyhow, and as it hasn’t, the thing can’t
be helped. Long before the McGowen Govern-
ment came into office it knew that, owing to
the expiration of the Braddon clause, there
would be a great falling off in revenue
for the year to June 30, 1911. It knew that
its party would either be in power with the job
of finding the money to fill the gap, or in opposi-
tion with the need for some coherent idea of
how its opponents should fill the gap, so that it
could intelligently criticise their proposals. Either
way it required to have about it some well-defined
and efficient plan for the finding of more money.
Apparently it hadn’t any shred or semblance of a
plan. It didn’t even restore the taxes which its
predecessor took off in the days when the Com-
monwealth was keeping the local Treasury full.
All it has to say is that it is going to have almost
the maddest loan boom in the State’s history, and
a very large shortage on the year’s revenue to
boot, and that it has closed up Parliament and
gone for a lengthy holiday. As for economy, re-
garded as a partial substitute for more revenue, it
isn’t even alluded to.
* * * *
Some eight months ago the people of Australia
gave to the Federal authority full power to take
over the State debts. About that time the Federal
Labor Government came into office. It has done
some good things and some dubious ones; but
it hasn’t taken over the State debts, or pro-
pounded a plan for taking them over, or sug-
gested taking them over, or even shown any sign
of remembering that the people gave it a mandate
on the subject. In fact, its disregard for the popular
mandate has been something stupendous. It
had a great chance to do something effective
in this connection when it drafted its scheme for
the issue of Federal notes, but it did nothing ;
instead, after carefully listening to the advice of
all its worst enemies, it reduced its Federal notes
policy to such a decayed shadow that the thing
might almost as well have been dropped. The
transfer of the State debts to the Commonwealth
would probably have included Federal control of
State borrowings, and how badly that is needed
the present financial riotings of Kidston and
McGowen and Murray and Verran are evidence.
Whether they have burst forth with the idea, that
as the debts must be handed over to the Com-
monwealth some day, they may as well have
a perfect devil of a debt to hand over, oy
whether they have burst forth simply because they
felt that way it is impossible to guess. But it is
certain that in a time of good seasons, large
revenues and fine prospects, when Australia should
be able to pay for its works out of its own income,
if it is ever going to do so, the old disease has
broken out again in a virulent form. Even the
few casual scruples which had developed re the
habit of charging wholly unproductive jobs and
repairs to Cohen seem to have dropped out of
sight. On the evidence, it would be advisable for
the Australian Government to think hard over
the cases of Kidston and McGowen and Verran
and John Weary. They are piling up liabilities
for it to wrestle with. They are having the orgy
and leaving it to do the cleaning up. What atti-
tude does the Federal Government propose to
assume with regard to (1) the taking over of the
present debts; (2) the paying off of the present
debts; (3) the control of future borrowings? If
it doesn’t know its own views on these matters it
is time it found out. The rush of the State
authorities to borrow £30,000,000 threatens to
complicate matters.
A MINISTRY OF GRACE AND
ELEGANCE.
Dear Bulletin, —Some little time ago the bank
in which I keep my obscure account reconstructed
its premises. The door was put where a window
used to be, and a window where the old door
hung out; and a stair and a chimney were inter-
fered with, and the corner which used to be sharp
was sawn off, and made blunt. Also, the roof
was taken off, and two new storeys were added,
and the roof was put on again. The top storey
was painted a faint yellow, and so was the bottom
one, while the three intervening storeys were
made of a crushed strawberry hue. And when all
this work was finished the contrast with the
dirt-colored pub adjacent, and the bleached
and faded and skull-like fish-shop opposite was
something terrible, for the dirt-colored pub was
old and shabby, and the fish-shop looked like a
Jiggety Jane female with LSany previous con-
victions. As for the blue monkey-shop down the
street, with man’s flea-infested ancestor for sale
in the window, it seemed shockingly out of keep-
ing with its renovated neighbor. From these
things,and many others like them, slowly evolved
an idea of the need for a new member of the
Cabinet —a Minister for Grace and Elegance—
whose sole duty would be to make things clean,
tidy and beautiful. He would necessarily be a
person with stupendous powers, and, in the ori-
ginal years of his department’s existence, when it
was cleaning up the grime and neglect of
ages, he would also be a person with a
stupendous expenditure. His subordinates would
include architects, engineers, artists, a poet or two
of the kind who write about the sunset and the
blossoms and the stars, possibly a prize-fighter
(for his early career would be stormy), and per-
haps the driver of a sanitary cart. And he would
be backed up by a new code of laws which would
levy heavy fines for ugliness, dilapidation and an
undue mixture of crude tints. Also, the uglier
the premises the higher would be the municipal
rates. An ordinary rate of Is. in the £ would be-
come, automatically, 2s. in the £ on an ill-shapen
and hunch-backed structure, with 6d. extra for
dirt, 6d. for lack of paint or for discordant colors,
6d. for broken windows, 6d. if the back of the
place didn’t look as well as the front, and
Is. more if the premises were built of wood. And
wooden garden fences would be extra —upright
ones, 3d. in the £ ; the drunken or sagging variety,
6d. Total, ss. 6d. in the £.
* * * *
The key to the situation is the back lane or
back yard. It is the whited sepulchre—the half
of our alleged civilisation which is plain bar-
barism. It is generally dirty, often muddy, often
dark, usually unpainted, and always there are
kids yelling in it. The house that is Queen
Anne in front and Mary Ann behind has been
often written about; but it is comparatively re-
spectable. The real evil is the place that is Sarah
Jones in front and seven devils behind. The short
and simple remedy for this evil is that no pre-
mises ought to be allowed to have any back at all.
That is to say, the back should be absolutely as
respectable as the front—so much so, that people
who disagreed as to which was one and which was
the other might fight eight rounds without getting
any nearer to a decision. Also, the back lane should
be so much like the front street that it might
really be the front street for 20 years or more
before anybody noticed the fact. At present
there is, unfortunately, more back lane than front
street, and about as much back ya<rd as there is
front street; and when a dismal crop of side
alleys is thrown in, it may be roughly estimated
that three-fourths of our alleged city civilisation
can’t bear inspection, and a good portion of the
other fourth isn’t fit for publication.
* * * *
It is interesting to think of the possibilities of
the capital of a State in which the Minister for
Grace and Elegance was the highest ruling
authority. Not only would the streets be straight
and wide, they would also be architectural har-
monies. There wouldn’t be six different styles of
architecture—the Corinthian, the early colonial,
the old public-house, the threepenny, the dog-
kennel, and the dilapidated iron tank variety—
in one highway. There wouldn’t be occasional
buildings which stood up like the last re-
maining front tooth of a god, while
others squatted low down alongside like a
dog in the midst of an apology. There would be
no gaunt isolated galiles showing with blue-
painted beer advertisements on their ribs. A
street would be a double range of buildings of one
style, color and height. It would be an architec-
tural whole, whereas at present it is usually a
hole. It might be absurd to build an entire city
according to one architectural plan, but each
street should have a character of its own. When
business boomed and more accommodation was
required, an extra storey could be put on the
whole city, instead of allowing a maddened heaven-
scraper to go up here and there and bean eyesore.
Under these circumstances there could be the usual
roadway on the ground level, with a row of shops
or offices on each side. Then there could be
another row of shops or offices on the first floor,
and the roofs of the verandahs (verandahs would
be compulsory and solidly built and all of one
height) would supply a second roadway for foot pas-
sengers only. A third roadway would be on the
roofs ; by having bridges over all the intersecting
streets it would be possible to walk on the roofs
from one end of the business part of the city to
to the other. The world is quite accustomed to
overhead railways, and it is hard to see
why there shouldn’t be also overhead foot
passengers. There would be trees in every
street, and there seems to be no assured
or positive reason why there shouldn’t be
pot plants—compulsory pot plants—in at least
one row of windows. They and the trees would
harmonise—compulsorily—with the general tone
of the district. And the street would, above all
things, be clean. The buildings would be scrubbed
or painted regularly. The old, murky entry into
the old-fashioned suite of offices—the entry with
the grime of ages upon it and the faded signs of
long-established solicitors and house-agents look-
ing like venerable clods of dirt upon the wall—
would be completely renovated at least once a
year, and made to look like the rose of Sharon.
And the man who allowed his brass plate to fall
into verdigris and disrepute would be lined for the
first offence, and have his plate disqualified for the
second.
•*■*-*■■*
There are buildings—gaols, cotton factories,
bone mills and such-like—which it is the fashion
to assume must be ugly and uncouth to the end of
time. A little consideration suggests that there
is no need for this ugliness. A bone-mill would
look like the Parthenon at Athens in its best days
if it were built that way ; and it would be impos-
sible to tell the difference outwardly between a
gaol and the famous Taj Mahal, if the architect
were given a free hand and were the right sort of
architect. Of course, if the bones were left in
heaps outside the building that looked like the
Parthenon, it would give away the show; but
there is no reason why the bones should
be left in heaps outside. Everything is cap-
able of beautification; even the Dago’s fruit
barrow, if it were compulsorily varnished
and the wheels painted to harmonise with
the general tone of the locality which its
owner haunted, would look very unlike the
barrow it is now. The central idea is to
make every person responsible in the sense that
his property must not only be no insult to the
artistic eye, but must be a positive source of
pleasure. The proprietor of an unused town
allotment should be prohibited from erecting
shocking advertisement hoardings upon it, and—
more than that—he should be compelled to keep
the fence tidy, and to sow buffalo grass on
the property so long as it remained vacant,
and keep the verdure regularly cut and
watered. Shrubs might also be enforced.
Circus tents and bills should be abolished,
and illuminated advts. carefully supervised. To
tell the difference between what is and what should
be, let anyone consider the famous Unter den
Linden at Berlin, and then compare it with the
most unkempt section of the Cook’s River road
outside Sydney. The moral chasm represents the
need of a Minister for Grace and Eleganoe.
* * * *
It may be that these reforms, and the thousand
other reforms that are urgently required, could
only be accomplished by making the ownership of
every city a State monopoly. If that is so, then city
ownership should be a State monopoly. There are
few matters in which private ownership has been
a worse failure. The private proprietor leaves
his building up till it falls down, or is officially
condemned, or becomes unlettable—in short, till
it pays him in cash to reconstruct it. The idea of
reconstructing it for aesthetic reasons and taking
Eart of his dividend in beauty doesn’t appeal to
im, and even if it did he would gain little by re-
building after the purest lonic style in Sussex-
street, Sydney, while his next neighbor was a 70-
year-old dog-box with the tawdry sign, “Good
Bedds, As a consequence, even the
best thoroughfare generally has an unfortunate
and depressing tail to it. (The one street in
Sydney which is nearest to being an ideal
thoroughfare is Bridge-street from Pitt-street to
the Domain, and it is mostly State-owned.) If
the suggestion of a roof-walk all over the city
were adopted it would make an end of the left-
over remnants —the desolate 70-year-old cottages
and one-storey humpies—which now linger among
modern buildings; they would simply have to be
reconstructed to preserve the continuity of the
roof walk. (Of course, it wouldn’t be wholly con-
tinuous in a straight line—that is to say, it
would have to skirmish round cathedrals and some
few other highly picturesque buildings which, by
special permission, were allowed to stand out of
the regular scheme of things; but these devia-
tions would be comparatively few.) By putting
all public-houses on the ground floor the chance
of drunks throwing themselves headlong off the
roof promenade would be reduced to a minimum.
And as there would be three tiers of police—
ground-level police, balcony-level bobbies and
roof cops—it would be possible to concentrate a
much larger constabulary force at a sudden emer-
gency than can be done now, when there is only
one tier of peelers. This would make for order
and the prevention of “ language ” —including
“ blanky.” The upper tiers of police could wear
uniforms to harmonise with the compulsory pot
plants.

There are other subjects which I would like to
touch upon, including Domain loafers (who should
be compelled to loaf behind leafy screens), brown
paper in the streets, orange-peel, badly-selected
and inharmonious dogs, frayed window-blinds,
and the like; but it is unfortunately impossible to
do more than give an outline of the subject.—

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
{Without apologies to Kipling or anybody else.)
Melbourne, Dec. 22.—The provisional regulations and
instructions for universal military training under the
Defence Act, 1903-10, were passed at a meeting of the
Federal Executive Council to-day.
The first part contains the compulsory provisions of
the Act, setting out that boys of 12 to 14 years of age will
be required to train in the junior cadets, 14 to 18 years
in the senior cadets, 18 to 25 years in the citizen forces,
and 25 to 26 years in the “Reserves.”
Fall in ! Along the plain, bush and range and
river.
Deep—two deep, an’ answer to yer blanky
name.
’Struth ! There ain’t no need to wet yer lips and
shiver.
You’re few, o’ course—but think of all ther
fame.
Cheer! For- yer gun and naked bayonet.
Cheer ! For the dam destroyers in th' bay.
The time it ’as come
To beat Australia’s drum ,
And to git a move on for th’ Blood-red Day.
’Shun ! Head up, and watch the six-star flag

other tenth of the population is so widely scat-
tered that no immediate attempt will be made to
muster it. The area under the Act is divided into
224 training areas, with an officer in charge
of each, and he will commence work with
the glad new year. The first six months will
be devoted to registering the troops, and
it is hoped that the enemy won’t be in a
hurry and won’t burst into the midst of the regis-
tration. Every fit male person within the military
area whose 14th, 15th, 16th or 17th birthday hap-
pens during 1911 is expected to enrol himself
promptly. The individual who reached the age of
17 on December 31, 1910, is considered too old to
serve; the one who doesn’t reach the age
of 14 till January 1, 1912, is regarded as
too young and is postponed till next year.
Thus, when actual training commences, say on
July 1, 1911, the Commonwealth’s oldest citizen
defender will be aged 17i, and its youngest 13£.
These will be all cadets —juniors up to the age of
14 and seniors up to 18. In 1912 the first—the
very first—citizen soldier will reach the age of
18 and pass into the adult or partially adult
forces, where he will remain till he is 25.
Then he will put in one year’s training in the re-
serve. So it will be 1915—the year when the
Anglo-Jap treaty expires—before the Common-
wealth possesses a single trained citizen soldier,
aged 21, and even at that age the country’s warrior
is hardly matured enough to be of great value in
actual service. It is reckoned that it will be 1920
before there are 127,000 men and boys—half of
them will be boys—in actual training and reserve.
It is a darned long time to wait, considering the
outlook, and a force of about 65,000 fairly trained
men isn’t much to get after all that waiting—not
much in these days of big battles and with
such a huge continent to defend. In fact,
after nine years of delay Australia will just have
about enough trained soldiers to make a decent
skirmish. It is an amazing case of putting our
faith in Providence, this idea of exempting
from service the whole male population aged
above 17, and so fixing things that the very first
trained adult citizen won’t be due to arrive till
1915 ; but apparently the idea is that the present
adult population is too mean and cowardly to do
anything for its native country itself, and that the
responsibility, like the bill for the borrowed
money, must be passed on to the kid in order to
make” the proposal acceptable. Thus the future
divides itself naturally into three parts. Until
1915 this country will have really no mili-
tary defence. From then till 1920 it will
have a little, but not much. After 1920 it
will have a little more ; but through the habit of
allowing the citizen soldier to drop out of training
at the age of 26, it won’t have much more. Prob-
ably the best thing that can be done is to send a
telegram addressed, “Mr. Monkey, Japan,”asking
that individual to postpone any unpleasantness
till 1940 at earliest.
The Dog that Expects to Have His Day.
A voice which sounded like the cry of the writing
on the wall spoke from Hobart in the columns of
the Sydney Telegraph last week. What the
writer desired to say was that every dog has his
day even though every day may not have its dog,
and that Tasmania’s time is coming in a commer-
cial sense. His story contained elements of
plausibility. Just now the tendency is to build
larger and still larger steamers. A 30,000-ton sea
tank is more economical than two of 15,000 tons,
much more so than three of 10,000 tons, and
very much more so than six of 5000 tons.
There is profit in the big tank under con-
ditions in which the smaller ones only show
a loss. So the 32,000-ton steamer and the
45,000-tonner have arrived, and the 60,000-
tonner is coming. Australia will presently clamor
for monster vessels of the new sort, and it is
reckoned that the extra profit to be made by run-
ning big ships, and the £II,OOO per trip that a
40,000-ton vessel would save in Suez Canal dues
by taking the Cape route —it would take that
route of necessity, for the Canal couldn’t let such
a vessel through—would make a 21-knot service
quite as feasible as the present 15-knot arrange-
ment. In other words, it is claimed that a
big, fast vessel coming via the Cape of Good
Hope, and making Hobart its one port of
call and distributing centre m the Common-
wealth, could deliver mails in Sydney and
Melbourne four days earlier than by the present
arrangement, and make a greater profit by doing it.
Where Hobart comes in is that it is the only capital
city in the Commonwealth where the port will ad-
mit the biggest type of steamer now projected—
where it can come straight to the city and tie to a
wharf —and when the big ship comes—as presum-
ably it must—either the other States must
drop their Congestion madness or else they
must be content, so far as the great mail-
boats are concerned, to be mere branches of a
central establishment in Tasmania. There are
ports hereabouts, beside Hobart, which would
admit 45,000-ton craft or even larger ones; but by
the cussedness of things there are in most cases no
towns of importance on or near them. For various
reasons the early settlements were mostly
made on inferior ports, and when the superior
ones were discovered the jealousy of the settle-
ments on the inferior ones kept them shut up. But
Hobart had the luck to camp beside 72ft. of
water, and even if a 100,000-ton ship came along
it feels that it would be equal to the case. And
it is a cheap place ; as it isn’t loaded down with
immense debts incurred in dredging artificial
waterways, it charges visiting ships a mere no-
thing by comparison with some of the mainland
ports. So its case is that by making it the ter-
minus, Australia can have far bigger ships and a
much faster service at less cost. In fact, the Tas-
manian dog reckons that its day is coming.
A Corpse in the N.S.W. Assembly, and its
Bearing on a Badly-needed Reform.
Previous to the last N.S.W. elections the anti-
Labor press rejoiced considerably because, what-
ever the result, the State was “assured of the
boon of two-party government.” When the re-
turns came in, the papers modified their rejoic-
ings ; but they still cheered faintly, inasmuch as
there was “a definite cleavage between Liberalism
and Labor, thus rendering the two-party system
inevitable.” This conclusion was arrived at by
affixing the “Liberal” label to Harry Levikn,
H. D. Morton and others who had won their
seats mainly by disowning and vehemently de-
nouncing Wade and all his works. And so the
“Liberal” press was enabled to prove that
the Government’s majority in the House
was only one, and that when the votes of
Cann and R. D. Meagher were eliminated
it would amount to a deficit. Events failed to
justify that view. So far as Labor’s majority is
concerned, it has hovered persistently in the
neighborhood of nine ; it has soared as high as 18,
and it has never been below four. The two-party
ideal fell dead on the threshold of the new Parlia-
ment, and was never revivified. A third party is
in full bloom ; and it is obviously going to either
expand, or develop into a fourth party. Wade’s
blundering leadership inspires the more intelli-
gent Liberals with dissatisfaction, and his cease-
less moans over the loss of office fill them
with contempt. The larrikinism of Wood
pains the more decent-minded, and the mulish
hatred of change that is forced on the
Opposition by the party “bosses” is re-
volting to a large section. State Right
Tories like David Storey and good Federalists
like Fell are known to have the same low opinion
of WADE-ism in the House, that “Liberals ” such
as Carruthers, Ashton, Dick and B. B.
O’Conor have outside it. Nor is it all peace and
unity in the ranks of Labor. There are up-
couutry Laborites who fear Nielsen’s land policy,
Nationalists who hate the parochialism of Hol-
man, level-headed Democrats who are shamed and
exasperated at the borrowing mania of McGowen.
Summed up, the two-party system is as utterly
dead in the N.S.W. Assembly as it is in the
British House of Commons, or the German Reich-
stag, or the French Deputies. And the deader it
proves itself the more obvious becomes the need of
elective Ministries. As things are, the McGowen
Administration has been living, and is doomed to
go on living, on the sufferance of a handful of
“Independents.” They alone stand between
McGowen and those who yearn for the one ad-
verse vote that, according to the absurd rules of
the Parliamentary game as at present played,
will put the State to the worry, disorganisation
and vast expense of another general election.
Hence the McGowEN-ites have had to walk with
such extreme wariness, during the past month or
so, that reforms for which the country looked
were not forthcoming. The rank foolishness
of the position is stupendous enough to im-
press the imagination of a suburban aider-
man. Under a scheme whereby each Minis-
ter was elected, irrespective of party, by all
the members, for Parliament’s three years
of existence, the idiotic convention that forces a
new election on the country for no better reason
than that some measure put forward by the
Government chances to be rejected in the House,
would be wiped out. Members would be enabled
to vote according to their consciences, as opposed
to the present system, which forces them to vote
to keep their leaders in office. Vital issues would
be grappled with, and not, as now, cautiously
steered clear of. The Tory who is for ever
bemoaning the fact that the better sort of
citizen shuns politics would have cause
to howl no more. The scotching of the
discredited two-party superstition must make for
political honesty. Self-respecting citizens whose
views, as expressed in private and in public, are
familiar to their intimates, aren’t going to be
identified with a party—whether Labor , or
“Liberal” —whose cast-iron regulations compel
members to either vote blindly with the crowd or
be pushed out. Till M.’sP. are as free to speak
and act the way they feel, as if they were in a
Board room or on a club committee, Parliament
won’t begin to acquire wholly honest and inde-
pendent law-makers. Put otherwise, Parliament
will remain destitute of the best type of legislator
till it formally buries two-party Government and
accepts the logical outcome of the funeral—the
elective Ministry system.
Premier Murray and a Coffin.
A few days before he had his Christmas dinner,
Premier Murray allowed an amendment to be
made in his new Factories Bill, by which “the
dairying industry,” except butter factories and
milk condenseries, were exempted from the opera-
tion of the new rural Wages Boards. Two days
later the Camperdown Chronicle (Vic.) pub-
lished the following headings to the report of a
police-court case, in which a dairy hand was suing
for his wages:—
Claim for Wages.
Allegations of Inhuman Treatment.
Employee Goes for Coffin for His Child, and has
Two Shillings Deducted for “Lost Time.”
It is a pretty horrible heading, but the details of
the case live up to it very well. The dairy-hand
in question and his wife were employed as a
married couple, at £1 7s. 6d. per week (for the
two) and find themselves. They were given a
house to eat and sleep in, and had to find their
own furniture. Part of the time the man and his
wife —and two children —slept on ferns. The coffin
comes into the narrative through the death of
one of the children (shut up alone while the parents
were milking), owing to poison having been negli-
gently left in the house by a former employee.
The wage works out at 13s. 9d. each. For this
the man and his wife were required to milk 40
cows seven days a week. And this is the industry
which Premier Murray reckons does not require
a Wages Board ! The 40 cows which these two
unfortunates milked will produce annually about
£4OO worth of milk. Add the value of the skim-
milk (which is returned free), and there is a total
of £460. Out of this the miserable married-con pie
received between them £7llos. per annum. And
on top of it complainant alleged that, when he
went in for a coffin for his dead child, the farmer
deducted 2s. for “loss of time.” The employee
claimed £2 15s. 7d. for wages due, and the Bench
gave an order for the full amount, with £4 15s.
costs. This case may not be typical of the in-
dustry. It is so bad, indeed, that, but for the
sworn evidence in the court, it would be hardly
credible. But it shows what the absence of
wages boards or other controlling legislation leads
to; it explains why the industry has such a foul
name; and it ought to convince the decent men
in the business that, with competitors of this
sort, they are as much interested as anybody else
in getting wages fixed by a board. Finally, the
case is bad enough to turn itself into a nightmare
and howl through the fatuous Murray’s slumbers
for the next three months.
Tlie Artificial Border.
The row about the west Victorian harbor of Port-
land—which is just the same as many other har-
bors and many other rows in Australia—has
lately made itself heard again. Portland is a
remarkable instance of the congestion policy,
though there are other instances almost as
remarkable. Victoria has two very fine harbors
and several bad ones. Melbourne is one of the
bad ones, but it was good enough in the early
days when petty schooners were the chief means
of sea conveyance. In fact, in those days, a shallow
river mouth with a big stream of fresh drinkable
water flowing into it was regarded as better than
a deep harbor without the big stream of drinkable
water; and a harbor with 6ft. of water
seemed better than one with 30ft., for when the
little schooner anchored it didn’t require so much
cable. So Victoria’s capital was planted on the
shallow Yarra River, while Westernport was
wholly and Portland mostly ignored. By the
time it was proved, through the increase in the
size of vessels, that Melbourne was a gigantic
mistake, it had grown big enough to be a Vested
Interest. It flatly refused to move from its idiotic
location, and it taxed all Victoria to make an
artificial port on the Yarra, while the State’s two
great natural ports were systematically killed by
want of wharfage, want of adequate railway com-
munication and outrageous railway rates. The
case of Westernport is remarkable enough, but
that of Portland is amazing. It is the only
really excellent harbor on 1000 miles or more
of coast, in a country where good harbors are
scarce enough to be valuable; yet it does hardly
any business. Its trade with the North is ruined
because there is no direct railway—Melbourne in-
fluence prohibits that. Its trade with the East is
ruined by exorbitant railway rates, levied in the
interest and at the dictation of Melbourne —the
place'with the artificial harbor. Its trade with
the West is killed dead because that way lies the
S.A. border, and Adelaide lays down the law that
nothing inside the S.A. border must trade with
the outer world through Portland, because Port-
land is in Victoria. As it happens, S.A. is a poor
country, and its richest district lies down in the
south-east, close to the Victorian border. There
is no good port or semblance of a good port
there in S.A. territory; but Mount Gam-
bier, the centre of this affluent patch, is only
73 miles from Portland harbor—the place with
which it isn’t allowed to communicate. On the
other hand, it is some 312 miles from Port Adelaide
with a costly break of gauge on the railway in be-
tween, and all this superfluous conveyance is a
grievous handicap to the Mount Gambier district
and a serious loss to the State of which it forms a
part.' But the superstition that artificial border
lines l must be observed is apparently incurable,
and when the garden of S.A. recently complained
again about being ruined by 240 miles of need-
less haulage it got for answer something like this :
The Premier gave us to understand that his Govern-
ment was determined not to lose the south-eastern trade
to Victoria.
So on one side of an artificial border the garden
of S.A. must just wilt for want of a sea outlet
that can be reached without ruinous expense, and
on the other side of the same artificial border a
splendid port must just go to waste for want of
business—the business which would gladly get
there if it was allowed. And all this because, in
the back blocks of last century, the artificial bor-
der was ruled off on the map by men in England
who didn’t know Mount Gambier from a crow or
Portland from the hind leg of a serpent, and the
men who do know haven’t the courage or honesty
to undo the mistake.

The State Railways and the State Thief..
Will the time ever arrive when Australia’s State
Treasurers will be compelled to abandon their
habitofusing railway profits tofillup the holes
in their annual balance-sheets ? This iniquity—
an iniquity because it is based on the reduction of
permanent way construction and repair expenses
to the lowest possible limit—is perpetrated year
in and year out in practically every State in the
Commonwealth. W. A. Watt’s Victorian budget
is a recent example. The State accounts for
1909-10 show an actual hiatus of £102,866 between
general revenue and expenditure. It is only by
collaring about £150,000 out of the net railway
profits that Watt’s alleged surplus of £47,080 is
produced. That is bad enough, but for this cur-
rent year—if he stays in office long enough— Watt
proposes even greater d epredations. The prospect
of asurplusof £24,3BSisheld out, butitall depends
on the railways providing net earnings totheextent
of £296,571. That is the amount that the worried
Watt hopes to collar for the year 1910-11. If he
doesn’t grab that sum, his accounts for this year,
instead of a bogus surplus, will, on present
appearances, show a deficit. Of course, the
average State Treasurer will never willingly
announce a deficit, so long as it remains possible
to raid the net earnings of the railways; there-
fore Watt or his successor is sure to leap on this
year’s spoil with the usual velocity. It is no
wonder, then, that these whole-hog railway
accidents happen in Victoria ; £150,000 may not
go very far in constructing new lines, but it would
pay for the putting down of a whole lot of new
rails—the sort of rails that are indispensable
for modern railroad haulage. Victoria, up till
lately, was the joke of the whole railway world
on account of the preposterous smallness of
the average trainload hauled on its railways.
On the best-conducted lines in other continents
trainloads of 2000 tons on long-haul journeys are
quite common. This means 50-ton freight-cars
and a permanent way adequate to the terrific
wheel pressure. In Victoria, of course, nothing
like this is at present possible. Yet it ought to be
made possible, because big loads—if the track will
stand them —mean smaller costs and larger train-
mile profits. Until the State thief is made to give
Up stealing the State railway surplus, however,
Victoria will never see its railways conducted on
modern lines. This applies to N. S. Wales and
all the other States, as well as Victoria. Only in
Victoria the railway-plundering surplus-faking
habit is brandished with the greatest amount of
cheek and the eompletest disregard for conse-
quences. The Sunshine, Richmond, dunes, Gem-
brook, Greensborough, Bochara and other acci-
dents show the kind of results that may be
expected, and which have punctually arrived, in
a State where it is politically permissible for an
anguished Treasurer to plug up the holes in his
balance-sheet with the cash that ought to be used
to hire more railway servants, put down heavier
rails, build bigger and better rolling stock, pay
better wages, shorten overworked employees’
hours, and generally improve the public railway
service. And.until a new financial system is
arrived at, whereby the net earnings of the rail-
ways will be held inviolate, wholly free from the
depredations of deficit-haunted Treasurers—until
some plan of this sort is adopted Victoria can
expect to find fresh corpses and thousands of
pounds’ worth of shattered rolling stock strewn
regularly over the premises.

The Cohuna Land Scandal.
After considering the evidence that was put be-
fore him, Judge Box, whom Premier Hurry of
Victoria appointed a Commission of Inquiry
into the Cohuna land scandals, has handed
in his report. Briefly, Mr. Box finds (1)
that C. R. Anderson, an officer of the State
Rivers and Water Commission, acting as agent
of the Closer Settlement Board, failed to tell
that concern that he was interested in some
land it wanted to buy, and on which he was asked
to report, which action placed him “ in a position
utterly inconsistent with unbiassed. advice or
honest valuation” ; but (2) that the said Ander-
son did not make use of official information con-
fided to him for his own or any other person’s
benefit, advantage or profit. Also, Mr. Box con-
siders that the Closer Settlement Board didn’t pay
too much for the land at Cohuna, though he
doesn’t attempt to square this conclusion with
the fact that Anderson and O’Connor had just
previously bought it at a much lower figure than
that at which they traded it off to the Board.
That is the net result of much agitation, of months
of inquiry, of the close examination of dozens of
witnesses, of waiting for Elwood Mead to return
from his world’s tour. It omits all reference to
the most interesting and interested party to the
business, one O’Connor. Anderson was interested
in one block of land bought by the Closer Settle-
ment Board; O’Connor in at least half a
dozen. In some mysterious manner O’Con-
nor always seemed to buy blocks of land
that the Board had its eye on, and
always managed to sell them at a tidy profit
to the Board. Doubtless Mr. O’Connor is an ex-
ceptionally good judge of likely land, and his pre-
monitions as to what the Board wanted amounted
to Heaven-sent intuitions ; but it was these mys-
terious occurrences that the Royal Commission
was expected to inquire into, and that is just what
it didn’t do. Wherefore O’Connor remains a
mysterious, but well-informed, citizen of unblem-
ished character; while Anderson is gently dipped
into the soup and then placidly steps out again.

Premier Kidston proposes to hitch a sinking
fund of 10s. per cent, on to his £9,991,000 loan for
railway construction. It isn’t much, for at that
rate the fund, invested at 3£ per cent, compound
interest, will take some 60 years to payoff the
debt, and the old two-rail style of line will almost
certainly be obsolete before then. But Queens-
land has £14,000,000 of old debt to provide for in
the next four years, and even a 10-shilling sinking
fund that only applies to a fragment of the State
debt may help to placate the enraged Cohen.
Australian sinking funds are variable brutes.
This was bow they stood at June 30, 1909—the
latest date covered by the writer’s information: —
Total Sinking Fund
Total Debt Sinking Fund in Proportion
30/6/’O9. 30/6/’O9. to Debt.
Queensland .. £44,276,067 Nil Nil
N.S.W. .. 90,307,4X9 £405,648 £0 8 Ilf p.c.
Victoria .. 54,667,197 727,021 1 6 7 „

W.A. .. .. 21,951,753 2,233,335 10 3 6 „•
Of the six the Westralian fund is the only one
which calls for serious respect. Westralia’s lia-
bilities are the newest, yet its provision for repay-
ment is by far the largest. It has a sinking fund
attached to every loan, while the other States
mostly lay aside tuppence at irregular intervals,
and Queensland simply trusts to Providence.
When ex-Premier Wade was screeching to the
N.S.W. Government to declare itself a State
Fright in regard to the April referendums, David
Fell stood out from the Opposition benches and
flogged his leader with this whip of scorpions :
I believe I am voicing the feeling of the majority of the
people of Australia when I say that the Federation will
be upheld before the State. If young Australians have
any national sentiment, they recognise the great poten-
tialities of the Federation as against those of the State in
which they live. If I am to be influenced by the state-
ments of the leader of the Opposition, who is also the
leader of the party to which I belong, I must come to the
conclusion that the Federal Parliament—and I am speak-
ing of it as a Parliament in which to-day we may have a
Labor Government and to-morrow some other Govern-
ment—is composed, and likely to be composed, of the
enemies of Australia. But I recognise that the people
who sent me here also sent the representatives to the
Federal Parliament, and on the principle that the greater
includes the less, I assume that the members of the
Federal Parliament, whilst they may view matters in
broader perspective than we do, will also recognise the
requirements of the State. The Liberal party have, un-
fortunately in my opinion, always put up the State
against the Federation, and they will always go down.
Sydney Daily Telegraph concluded an article
on “ The Closing Session ” with these harsh
words concerning its political leader :
It can scarcely be said that the Opposition has distin-
guished itself by any conspicuous display of the qualities
which make the dignified loser. Some of Mr. Wade’s
criticisms of the Government during the session would
have been distinctly better amongst the things left un-
said. As an example, the petty complaint about all the
public works proposed being in Labor constituencies....
We may hope that the effects of the recess on the nerves
of the late Premier, which underwent such a severe test
in the election campaign, will enable him to show to
better advantage next session.
It is the truth, though nothing like the whole
truth. The fact is C. G. Wade has shown him-
self to be about the worst loser in the history of
the N.S.W. Parliament. Holman was guilty of
succeeding Wade at the Crown Law office; where-
fore he was persistently treated as a dangerous
malefactor. As one instance, apropos the reprieve
of Phillips, the ex-Attorney-General proclaimed
that his successor “was unfit to be Minister for
Justice. It had gone forth to the world that so
long as Labor was in power, murder might Vie
committed with impunity.” That was the com-
ment of the supposedly responsible leader of an
alleged] y great party after the new Government had
decided that the murderer should be imprisoned
for life. McGowen, the big-hearted and in-
offensive, was in like manner howled at and brow-
beaten ; and the party at large was charged with
being traitors who yearned to “ filch ” the rights
of NTS.W. and trample it in the mud. Wade’s
astounding exhibition of bad sportsmanship may
have been due, as alleged, to “nerves.” If so, he
ought to be urged to stay not less than 12 months
in a rest-cure sanatorium. If it isn’t nerves, the
Anti-Labor party will require to get a new leader,
or be prepared to burst under the sheer weight of
popular disfavor.
♦
When N.S.W. decided on a Public Works Com-
mittee the idea was to make it a non-party body,
its members chosen for their special fitness for
the job. But the little men who are left in State
politics have pushed and dragged the thing further
and further away from that ideal. Seats on “the
Works” came to be reckoned as loaves arid fishes,
and for a while the practice was to whack them
between the two parties. At last, however, the
“Liberals” got greedy, and grabbed all the
Assembly-men’s seats but one; and the Labor
crowd has now hit back by squeezing
the “Liberals” off altogether, collaring three for
themselves and letting the Independents have
the fourth. Of course, the sore “Liberals” fling
the gibe—“ The spoils to the victors!” But
they’re both in the same boat; and what the dis-
gusted elector is invited to observe is that it’s the
same mean little boat to which Australia is being
urged to trust its fortunes, instead of passing
them on to the National Parliament.
A man who recently wrote to the papers demand-
ing Government testing of gas-meters, declared
that some of the N.S.W. gas companies systemati-
cally import meters which register 10 per cent,
more gas than they pass through. In other words,
the machines were specially made to over-register.
It was a large and ugly assertion to make ;
and the secretaries of sundry gas companies
replied with an indignant repudiation, declaring
that no British firm would stoop to supply such
meters. Next day, unconsciously knocking the
value of the denial kite-high, the papers came out
with a number of yarns about British firms supply-
ing faked invoices to sundry importers of motor-
cars with a view to defrauding the Australian
Customs Department. The Robert Reid ex-
posures and these motor-car revelations have
swept out any lingering faith in the idea
that British firms are owned by the children
of Galahad and managed by angels. Without
accusing the gas companies of deliberately using
faked meters, it can be safely said that gas
meters should be liable to State inspection,

ing apparatus, and it should be tested the same as
the prawn-seller’s pint measure. Moreover, the

A Gold Brick.
G. H. Knibbs, Federal Statistician, and a man
who is reputed to be threatened with information
has drafted a pension scheme for the Federal
Civil Service. It is interesting to compare it with
the scheme for the N.S.W. railway and tramway
men which ex-Preinier Wade dashed, shot,
pushed or otherwise propelled through the State
Legislature when votes were very, very badly
wanted a few months ago. That was frankly
described as “ the most liberal pension scheme on
earth,” and it was —it was as liberal as the case of
the man who sells alleged sovereigns at 6d. each,
or the offer of the person in disordered circum-
stances, who is compelled through urgent need of
money to offer a large gold brick for 19s. Bd.
Wade’s utterly insane proposition was something
like.this : Every public servant was to pay into
the superannuation fund 1J per cent, of his salary.
Thus, if he started at the age of 20 with £SO a year,
and ended at age 60 with £4OO a year, and
his average pay was £2OO a year, he would, on his
40 years’ service, contribute £l2O. Then, at the
age of 60, he would retire and commence to draw
a pension of £133 6s. Bd. per annum, and, accord-
ing to the life insurance table of averages, he
would goon drawing it for 13 years and weeks.
In other words, he was to pay £l2O, and get a
beautiful, wonderful, impossible gold brick of about
£1756. If a man whose salary had averaged £2OO
a year retired at the age of 40, which might
easily happen through blindness, loss of a limb,
or some other disability which didn’t tend to
shorten life, he would have paid in £6O, and he
would proceed to draw £66 13s. 4d. per annum,
with the prospect of do ng it for 25 years and 15£
weeks. His impossible gold brick was to be about
£I7OO in exchange for £6O. Knibbs’s comment on
these wild, mad promises is a cold table of figures.
He proposes that the male Federal civil servant
in all the principal offices, who closes his career at
a salary of £4OO per annum, shall receive a pension
of £l6O a year if he has been contributing to the
fund for 40 years, but instead of paying 1£
per cent of his salary, as Wade proposed,
he is to pay per cent., which is a mighty
difference. If he starts paying to the fund at the
age of 33, instead of 20, he must pay per cent,
of his salary, and his pension will be £IOB. If he
begins to contribute at 40, he has to pay 10 per
cent, for a pension of £BO, and so on. The terms
are a trifle lower in the humblest grades of the
service, presumably because the mere official
rouseabout doesn’t stick to his billet so persis-
tently as the higher man, and is less likely to be
there on pension day ; but even he, if he joins the
fund at the age of 30, has to pay 7 per cent, of his
salary instead of Wade’s 1\ per cent. The lady
civil servant, aged 20, is let off with a
payment of per cent, (and even that
is three times Wade’s maximum) because
the odds are many to one that she will marry and
leave the department ; but if she joins the fund
at the age of 35 she has to pay 6 per cent., and,
later on, the figure is still higher. The lowest
figure for naval and military men is 9i per cent.
These calculationsexpress Knibbs’s candid opinion
of the blank, crazy insolvency of Wade’s railway
and tramway pension scheme. And the special
woe of Wade’s scheme is its enormous future pos-
sibilities. The railway and tramway men are a
fairly large army now; but when the N.S.W.
lines grow to the mileage of the United Kingdom
(and as N.S.W. is very much larger than the
United Kingdom, that event may be reason-
ably looked for) they are likely, on British
figures, to number 700,000. The present po-
sition is bad enough, and is constantly
getting worse; and when there are 700,000
employees, each liable to pay the Government
£6O and demand back £B7B, it will be magnificent.
And, in addition, there are frills and extras and
special allowances on Wade’s gold-brick scheme
which Knibbs carefully avoids; but, after all, when
the basis of a plan is raging lunacy an extra frill
or two is neither here nor there nor anywhere
else.
The High Court’s decision that the Seaman’s
Compensation Act is invalid puts the DEAKix-ites
in a hole. The recently-slaughtered Act was
passed by the Fusion Government; yet nothing
but an amendment of the Constitution along the
lines suggested by the Australian Government
will make it operative. If Deakin and co. con-
tinue to oppose the amendment of the Con-
stitution, they will have to argue that there
is no particular need for a Seaman’s Com-
pensation Act; and if they have the nerve
to say that, they will inevitably be asked
wh£ they went to such trouble to pass it. Inci-
dentally, there are the Excise and Union Label
Acts, both of which were passed when Deakin
was Premier, both of which have been disqualified
by the High Court, and neither of which can
become law unless the Constitution is altered.
And with regard to them also the same awkward
question will rise up against Deakin.
The president of the Australian Women’s League
has issued a wild, whirling screech in Melbourne
on the subject of the coming referenda. The
lady couldn’t have screamed worse or been more
incoherent if the proposals had ueen a ferocious
mouse: —
That which has taken the clearest thoughts, the wisest
brains we have had in our midst, combined with the
experience of nations, is to be ruthlessly cast aside,
destroyed by a handful of men, whether in Melbourne,
or, later, at Yass-Canberra, wh.o are eager for change,
who have, for the time being, power placed in their hands,
and, unaccustomed to this, their heads iiave been turned,
and’ they have been unable, in their knowledge and
enjoyment of such power, to give that calm considera-
tion and judgment which are always necessary before
great c ianges are made.
On the point as to “ the experience of nations,”
Mrs. Hughes might perhaps be reminded of tbe
fact that, besides the experience which the Aus-
tralian Constitution-builders had to guide them,
one nation has had the benefit of the Australian
experience as well. Australia reckoned that it
was taking the best tips from all lands, and making
the perfect machine. Then S’Africa came along,
saw where the Australian machine was weak, and
altered it accordingly before adopting it for its
own use. Australia now proposes to go a bit of
the way in the same direction, that’s all.

This revival of “ The Arcadians ” in Syd-
ney is chiefly distinguished by the appearance of
a new Sombra, tiie chief of the Arcadian sisters
who go forth with Simplicitas to convert the
cage-living monsters of London, after Simpy has
been dipped in the well of Truth with indifferent
results. Miss Winifred O’Connor, the new lady,
is an earnest, engaging Sombra, with a thorough
grip of the part; and her various songs ure quite
satisfactory. With the privilege of the chief
comedian, W. Cromwell maunders away from his
Simplicitas part to gather the loud laugh
in the field of knock-about farce. Tom
Walls is the same old, excellent Peter Doody, the
lugubrious jockey who's gotter motter; Miss
Gilliam brings back the brogue that might be
improved upon and the winning ways that
couldn’t be; a new Chrysea (Miss Dickinson)
scores heavily in a new dance ; and the Criterion,
where it all happens, has had a new coat of paint
—or a waistcoat, anyhow.

Before Hugh J. Ward’s “Girl from
Rector’s ” goes any farther, The Bulletin rushes
into print to advise those who intend visiting
the Palace for the purpose of being shocked,
to take along their own mental pepper-pots.
They’ll need them to warm up the place where ex-
pectation will feel the draught. When the extrava-
gance was smokiug round in its native originality
it may have been different; but respectability is
fearful of its reputation in small or compara-
tively small communities, so Australasia is
swindled out of its immoral rights. Hence,
instead of realising the falsely-raised hope of the
M.L. parsons that “The Girl from Rector’s” is
“ a beastly appeal to the basest passions,” Sydney
parsons and other sports are merely handed
out an appeal to enjoy the absurdity of a
series of hilarious situations which might
have been created by a number of local
young bloods, seeing life in the pubs where one
can hold the hands of the girl who wears curtain
rings for bracelets and calls herself Gwennie.
For two beers the Religious Editor would sue
Maoriland snuffledom for obtaining his attend-
ance at the show under false pretences.
• • * *
Nevertheless, “The Girl from Rector’s”
is a cheerful thing—farcical, of course, and obvi-
ously patched in places. The acting is as good
as, if not better than, anything Ward’s clever little
company has previously done, and the grotesque
contretemps of the second act would make a
funeral gallop. As Aubrey Maboon, Professor and
Wowser, Ward gives one more of those clever
characterisations which have so strongly welded
him to the public regard, and it is a melancholy
thought that after this season he will probably
never be seen again behind the footlights, except
in an occasional passing “turn” for charity’s sake.
Wvkehain, as Colonel Andrew Tandy, an old
buffer “seeing life,” can take it that he has never
done anything so well before. Grace Palotta is
no better as an actress than she was in the past;
also, she is no worse, which proves that she could
scarcely be better. There are a dozen others in
the cast, nearly all of them having difficult
character parts, and not a living soul of them but
ought to have a New Year bonus for the results.
Until further information “ The Girl from Rec-
tor’s” will continue to frivol at the Palace; but
The Bulletin proposes to seek the thrill it missed
at the next “Pleasant Sunday Afternoon ” con-
ducted by Snifkins.

At Sydney Royal, “Our Miss Gibbs”
is approaching her 100th appearance before
harbor-side audiences. She is the Clem Hill
of theatrical productions, and performing as she is
on a good wicket, with the bowling of popular
opinion fairly collared, nothing but a miracle of
ill-luck should prevent her running into the second
century.
* * #- *
“The Whip ” is attracting to Her Majesty’s
vast audiences composed mainly of lovers of (1)
Horse, (2) Horror. They get the goods they best
love, also some of the finest scenic effects that have
been witnessed in Sydney.
## # *
Amongst a score or so of theatres and
music halls open in Sydney on Boxing Night, and
mostly crammed, there was one house of mirth
that deserved as well as any of them the “House
full ” notice. That was the Standard Theatre,
in Castlereagh-street. The out-of the-wayness
of the place, and, possibly, lack of pub-
licity concerning the revival of the romantic
comic opera, “A Moorish Maid,” were the twin
reasons why the sign wasn’t necessary. To day
the fair-sized audience is giving its absentee
friend an idea of what ho has missed, so doubt-
less business will improve. It is some five
yeirs since Alfred Hill produced his opera
in Sydney, and in the interval the dusky
charmer has grown in some directions and
has been pruned in others. The music is always
fresh, vigorous and characteristically “colored.”
Alfred Hill can do things in the way of “orchest-
ral frescos,” to borrow Melba’s phrase, used after
listening to some orchestration by the Maori-
lander. The theme of the distressed princess who
governs without the aid of a consort, the imperso-
nation of a prince by a peasant, and the background
of a “ colored ” country like Morocco are not newly
hatched from the nest of librettory ; but, then, is
there anything new in that nest ? The writers
have at least presented the story with brightness,
rich trappings, romance and humor.
• * * *
Mr. Hill has capital aid in his present in-
terpreters. Mrs. Slapoffski, as La Zara, chief -
tainess of a mountain robber-band, had some hard
work for her high soprano ; but, as a chieftainess
should, she lifted her burden of arias with ease,
and got regular Boxing Night applause from the
audience. Her mandarin-yellow robes arid silver
forehead-caparisoning were quite impressive, and
bespoke the highly solvent and financial robber.
A. Appleby, the baritone, also bore a large
share of the hej.t and burden of the night. His
allotment of music and his Moroccan dis-
guise were fairly heavy. Tom Cannam, a
humorist, brought here by Brough in some
past years, was Castro, an English servant,
Morocco-bound as to clothes, the gayest circum-
stance in the opera. Auditors, weighed down
like the loaded frog of Calaveras County,
not with shot, but with turkey and plum pudding,
felt a stone lighter after the solos and choruses
of laughter that Cannam caused. Sydney
Price, as the Divorcer-General, made a fine
auctioneer of pretty slave flesh. Miss Zara
Wolinski, as Princess Hashma, was at her best
whilst singing and at her worst whilst acting.
Her dislike to having any man’s arm around
her was comically like the real thing, though.
As the Moorish maid, Mena, Miss Marcia Boulais
was an outstanding success of the production. If
she is a novice, she is a most promising one.
Misses Ruby Guest, Miss Clarice Buckman,
Oakden Brookes and others too numerous to men-
tion are worthy helpers in the joyous revival,
which will run for the remainder of the week.
Mr. Hill produced and conducted his creation.
The Six American Dancers and the pair of
acrobatic Blessings are Sydney Tivoli’s Christinas
box to faithful patrons. The Dancers’ turn,
which is handsomely dressed, is an exhaustive set
of high-stepping samples cleverly served up with
bright music. The balancing revolution of the
twin Blessings is clever in its way ; but on a hot
evening it is hard to enthuse when a lady holds an
inverted gentleman on her head, or supports him
on one rigid arm. Even the most skilful trick, if
it involves severe muscular effort, is tiring to the
watcher who has given up measuring time by the
clock-dial and is merely counting the minutes
between drinks. Walter Kelly, who has run in
some new stories, holds the top-end of the bill
without difficulty. Kelly’s easy, drawling mono-
logue is the sort of thing a summer night audience
likes best; his linked entertainment is as refresh-
ing as a tray of iced squashes. The Mevmotts,
Frank Harwood, Fred Bluett and Fanny Powers
are the programme’s other visible means of
support.
m* * *
As all Sydney can’t go to Maoriland,
Maggie Papakura brings Maoriland to Sydney.
A complete village has been setup atClontarf, on
the shores of Middle Harbor, and peopled by 50
tribesmen and tribesmaids ; and four times a day
the tribesmen and tribesmaids join in a mostly-
Maori entertainment, with the hakas and poi-pois
and the other weird dances that everybody
has heard about. And Iwa sings and Maggie,
the guide, probably drops a few words
into the visitor’s ear, and purrs, and
leaves him quite satisfied that the Pakeha woman
doesn’t own all the wisdom in the world. After
they have shown themselves to Sydney, the mem-
bers of the co. will go to London, reaching there
with a sheaf of weighty introductions at about
Coronation time.
The second of the Hopwood-Foldi mono-
logue and pianologue entertainments occurred
last week at the Y.M.C.A., and brought a second
and equally appreciative audience. Sister Madge
and Messrs. Staell and Sussmilch aided with
violin and voice, and the remarkable gowning of
the sisters H.-F. was not the least important
facet of the satisfactory show.
* * *
At Melbourne Royal the new Clarke and
Meynell Co. has come to light in “The Gay
Gordons,” and the breath of popular approval
blows lukewarmly on the effort. Billed as “a
play with music,” the novelty is mainly mild melo-
drama interspersed with songs and dances. In
the first act the interspersions are few and the
story is heavy with dialogue, but in the second
act the narrative gets considerably broken up and
many ditties happen among its fragments.
Nothing is very feeble in the whole course of the
effects save one or two bits of bathos,
nor is anything very forcible except, per-
haps, a rush of kilted Tommies down a
rocky path to congratulate Private Angus
Graeme on his sudden promotion to the blessed
peerage. The greatest surprise of the entertain-
ment is in the fact that the soldiers who burst so
dramatically upon the scene don’t follow up their
advantage by bursting into song. One feels that
here an opportunity is missed. The same feeling
recurs to the jaded onlooker in many subsequent
moments. These unconventional omissions add
nothing to the gaiety of the occasion.
**' * *
The G<ay Gordons and their female friends
and acquaintances are creatures of melodrama,
pure and undefiled. No cerulean coloring tinges
their human interest. Angus, the Hero (Frank
Lincoln) has a foster-mother (Maggie Knight),
who lives in a four-and-ninepenny cottage, and
weeps bitterly when his long-lost earldom comes
due. Also his foster sister (Kathleen Starling)
contributes sighs and smiles to the domestic
tragedy. A Yankee millionaire (W. J. Mont-
gomery) has a daughter (Florence Imeson) who
cherishes a deep-rooted antipathy to titles, and
disguises herself as another girl in her love epi-
sodes with Angus, the other girl being the blonde
daughter (Nell Finnis) of a travelling Punch and
J udy family. For the rest thereare tuneful members
of Scotland’s proud nobility and a well-appointed
crowd of choristers and make-weights who mingle
harmoniously with two fine scenes by Goatcher.
One of them is a moor in the Highlands, which
emerges from a veil of mist at daybreak, and is
greeted with roars of applause.
“JACK AND THE BEANSTALK." AT
HER MAJESTY’S, MELBOURNE.
Dame Trot
(Neil Kenyon).
King Stoncybrokish
(Jack Cannot).
The one thing wanting in this “ play with
music” is volatility. It is mostly a two-part
piece, devised for Seymour Hicks and Ellaline
Terriss in London; and whereas Frank Lincoln
is a bright, breezy comedian, with much of the
Hicks method of breathless hurry; and Miss
Imeson is a likable leading lady—their joint
endeavor to lift the show is hardly equal to its
weight. Miss Imeson tends to jerkiness and
excess of gesture in contrast to the other nice girl.
Miss Finnis, who has more repose of style, but is
too frequent in her smile—the toothy smile that
is the besetting sin of English actresses these
latter days. Kathleen Starling shines in the
vocal department. David Jefferson, as the
Punch and Judy man, is a typical small
and brisk comedian ; whilst Miss Kellie Cozens,
who figures as his middle-aged spouse, is ap-
parently too young for the part. She is
humorous, but her drollery wants more age and
avoirdupois. The small deficiencies, however,
are hardly worth considering. The work all
round is well done, yet there are no notable
points about it. The melodies are merely grace-
ful rather than striking, and the absence of
ginger in the dialogue and situations is the thing
that the average citizen has most recollection of
when the curtain falls.

Melbourne, thus far, is taking its “ Jack
and the Beanstalk” at Her Majesty’s with all the
I’everent attention due to an alleged pantomime
THE ARCADIANS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
In Arcadee all drinks are free,
And every man’s a brother.
And every miss as soon would kiss
The next man as another.
No cheque rebounds for lack of pounds,
They never think of money ;
Their lines they rhyme with Truth sublime
And live on nuts and honey.
They tell no lies, nor advertise,
They neither beg nor borrow ;
In Arcadee the land is free
Of sin and sweat and sorrow.
No clearance sale attracts the frail;
They have no Foy nor Hordern ;
No traffic Hop compels them stop ;
They need no Judge nor Warden.
The Christmas pud.’s not understood—
They haven’t got the suet;
They do not eat the slaughtered meat,
Nor think that others do it.
Their roof’s the sky. They know not why
Some others live in cages.
On beds of grass the nights they pass
And wake up simple sages.
I feel no grief. I like my beef
And pudding with some brandy.
The bed of grass I’d rather pass,
And solid roofs are handy.
Cold water straight I’m loth to rate
As quite the ideal quencher ;
And peanut sop I’d gladly swap
For gravy in the trencher.
The bower of love the sucking dove
May reckon rare and rorty ;
Yet p’raps one .wife may mean hss strife,
And —well, I’m passing forty.
So, though I miss some fragrant bliss
In far-away Arcady,
I’ll take my chance and have my dame
With Sydney for my lady.

From “Redtape, jun.” :
Cardinal Moran is reported to have said that, unless the
Labor Government throws its declared policy of educa-
tion overboard, the R.C. vote will be cast solidly against
Labor at the next election. Apart from the sanity or
otherwise of the particular bee in the Cardinal’s bonnet,
it ought to be made a punishable offence for public
characters to talk like this. If the Cardinal were to say
to McGowen : “ Give me £lO,OOO and I will buy you 50,000
votes,” he would be liable to arrest. Where is the moral
difference between that and the promise that 150,000'
voters will follow any Government if it sets aside a large
sum from the revenue to aid or advance the religious
views of those particular voters? Or that they will vote
down a Government that refuses to set aside that sum.
The fact that the R.C. vote won’t sacrifice its political
ideals and follow the Cardinal to the polls is quite beside
the question.
A good razor always brings joy to the soul of
the shaver, and it is worth a lot to see him thumb the
edge lovingly and place it away carefully where damp
shall not corrupt, or mothers-in-law get at It to use on
the pet corn. Craig and Aitken’s are advertising a pair
of ivory-handled Plums in a neat case for 30s. And if
you propose to make any shaver a present, that fact is
wort h remembering. Craig and Aitken you will find at
654 George-street, Sydney. Remember the address anct
the name of the razor, “ Plum," *
during the season of geese and goodfill. No-
thing has happened to the bulky Williamsonian
annual since the first night, barring some curtail-
ments which have added to its incoherency. The
present commentator labors under a horrible
suspicion that even the beanstalk has been cut out
and the death of the giant has been eliminated ;
but possibly his thoughts were wandering from
the subject when the fabulous vegetable grew and
the giant breathed his last. After witnessing the
casual appearance of an acrobat in a frock coat on
the terrace of B 1 underbore’s castle way back in
the early history of Britain, it is hard to keep
your mental eye fixed on anything but vacancy.
“Jack and the Beanstalk ” threatens to thrive for
many weeks, so the gradual disappearance of its
last vestiges of narrative can be recorded in future
issues of this paper.
** * *
Among the unaccountable events that have
blown into Melbourne Princess’s, at odd times,
since Sarah Bernhardt set the large red seal of
respectability on that elegant playhouse, “ The
Bad Girl of the Family ”is unique. In the utter
awfulness of its fatuity this “ sensational bedroom
drama” exceeds the limit. It is over the odds.
It takes the mud-pie, whilst leaving the cake, the
bun and the biscuit untouched. There is said to
be money in the production of “The Bad Girl”
wherever she goes, and money is the soul of busi-
ness, anyhow. But in this case managerial con-
fidence seems to have been misplaced. Such
an entertainment in such a theatre is as
anomalous as a dog-fight in a cathedral.'
Previous preposterous bellowdramas have had
some special feature of novelty in char-
acter or strength of cast or popularity
of cotnpanj- to commend them. For instance,
“The Fatal Wedding” had a bright kiddy hero-
ine and a children’s corroboree. “ The Midnight
Wedding” had Madge Mclntosh, Harcourt
Beatty and co. to give it dramatic weight.
“ The Face at the Window ” was at least startling
in its gruesome absurdity. Nothing peculiarly
horrible, oddly sentimental, or originally risky
occurs in this opening attraction of George Mar-
low's season at the Princess’s. The shop-girls’
dormitory is just a crude travesty of a scene
in “ Diana of Dobson’s,” and \ the incident
of a low comedian in a hobble skirt being
introduced into female society under she-pre-
tences is a reminder of a familiar Andersonian
shocker. The plot of “The Bad Girl” gives no
thought to coherence. It never verges on pro-
bability or approaches to common sense. Its
foolishness is tiresome; and the fact that it has
prospered in its travels around the Common-
wealth indicates a want of elementary education
in the State school systems. The co. includes
some capable performers, and the contrast of
plump and thin members is interesting, for it
suggests that some of them fatten on their mental
food, whilst others suffer from honorable dys-
pepsia. Diver, as an industrious seducer, is a
leading member of the lean kind, and another of
them is the comic clerk who delivers his dialogue
after the manner of a patter songster in a variety
show, But this, alas !is not a variety show.
** * *
Every afternoon, from 2 to 5 or there-
abouts, a children’s pantomime transpires at
the King’s, and the precocity of young Aus-
tralia (shakes its legs and shrills its lay in a
medley concerning “The Old Woman Who
Lived in a Shoe.” The youngsters who
do this deed are Tom Liddiard’s much-
travelled Lilliputians, recruited by some local
talent of the small-and-early sort. For the most
part they are somewhat jaded juveniles, who en-
core their respective turns as a matter of course,
and speak their lines with as much intelligence as
the dismal libretto demands. Here and there the
spirit of fun breaks into the steady mechanism of
the performance and provokes a hearty smile, but
as a rule the work is a mere infantile mimicry of
a full-sized Show, assisted by a lugubrious orchestra
that is old enough to know better. Probably the
children’s panto, fills a Christmas want. The
audience last Monday afternoon seemed to accept
it as a seasonable event, and the exceeding cheap-
ness of the turn-out was overlooked in considera-
tion of the tender years of the principals and
chorus.
** * *
“The Ladder of Life” at the King’s
seems improper to this season of peace and
good will. The drama is rich in howls and
enmity, drum tattoos and bagpipe noises. More-
over, corpses litter the plot in audacious pro-
fusion. One full-fed cadaver is found on the
lawn of General James Gordon. Hordes of tur-
baned dead festoon the crags of Dargai Heights.
A couple more late lamenteds illustrate two
scenes in the last two acts.. And to add to
this splendid gala of death, there is an army
of lovely crimes, ranging from forgery to
plain seduction. These are generally the
work of Becket and Redgrave, who plan
felonies with an art that is almost foppish.
George Cross fits his comfortable figure into the
togs of a Highland hero; Miss Duggan parades
the virtues of the heroine with the customary
ostentation ; Bert Bailey and Miss Erris pound
the audience with bits of discourse ; and Miss
Wilton is a Russian lady with an irregular baby
and unkempt past. Messrs. Duggan and Temple
Harrison assist in the dialogue, while the vocifer-
ous Edwin Campbell appears as a drink-sodden
product of slum education.
** * *
Since Barnold’s animals came to the Opera
House, Going to the Dogs has become a fashion-
able Melbourne habit. The team embraces
several dogs, some monkeys and a cat, and their
semi-human antics are exceptionally quaint—
especially those of Dan the Beer Canine, whose
liquor infects the house. Touching Ronsby’s
Pictures of Greater London, they seem good
enough to fill any Melbourne Cockney with a
homesick feeling; while the lady called Blessing
is still arousing admiration with her strong, bonnie
arms and kaleidoscopic frocks.
** * *
Jeffries and Johnson are now pirouetting
and pawing at the Melbourne Glaciarium. As a
preliminary, snapshots are given of Reno and its
crowds, and subsequently Jeffries is shown spar-
ring, skipping, receiving his friends and twisting
his mouth in intermittent chews. Then comes
the fight. During the whole of that affair John-
son is the epitome of supreme self-confidence, at
times using his hands with the daintiness of a
pianoforte professor, and always punctuating his
blows with large, golden smiles. On the other
hand, Jeffries is dour, crouched and aggressive, a
massive sanctuary for Johnson’s uppercuts, which
make his head bob about like a big, lone poppy
nodding in the breeze. Indeed, this relentless
uppercutting was more affecting than the final
knock-out, for it was significant alike of Jeffries’s
fine courage and pitiable futility.
While the Glaciarium is occupied with
the Decline and Fall of J. J. Jeffries, the
Taits are uncurling their films at the local
Athenaeum. Saturday’s programme included an
unusual picture in “The Foundling,” a semi-
devotional story that is peculiarly suitable to the
spirit of Christmas. Also started : A photo of
“Giraffe Hunting in Uganda” ; a lengthy bush-
ranging tale entitled “The James Boys” ; and the
heavenly narrative of Charlie Lee, a Chow with
the soul of a pattern saint.
** * *
At Spencer’s Olympia “The Road to
Richmond ” appeals to the taste of romantic
crowds. It is an episode of the Yankee Civil
War, spiced with the cuddle that makes life more
livable and love more lovable. “Daisies: A
Summer Idyll,” is a saccharine story, charm-
ingly produced ; while “ The Sleeping Sickness
of Tweedledum ” keeps one trying to recall some-
body it reminds everybody of. “Suffragettes
Raiding the House of Commons” shows the caste
of Vere de Vere in a new aspect, unfortunately
not mentioned by A. Tennyson.
** * *
Galsworthy’s “Justice,” as played by the
Literary Theatre of Adelaide, is unsatisfactory.
Its avowed aim is to show that the careless victim
of one criminal slip is hounded down and given
no chance to reform. But the author takes no
trouble to make his hero a sympathetic character.
Why not a bright, weak youth, annexing a bank-
note lying around ? This one is not seen till after
his crime, which consisted of altering “nine” on
a cheque to “ninety.” He says he was mad
when he did it; but he was sane enough
to cash the document and take the lot in
gold, and to alter the butt to correspond,
some days later. And he is gratuitously made
to want the cash, sO that he can bolt with a
married woman ! Again, after the penal servitude,
his old office is willing to take him back—which
is more than most law firms would do in real life ;
but he is still tangled up with the same female,
and he has quite unnecessarily got himself another
billet on a forged reference. So the audience does
not worry when, at the end, he fractures the back-
bone which nobody had credited him with possess-
ing. It is poor stuff to put amateur players on,
and one scene in a cell, where the youth, alone
and without speaking, is expected to indicate
coming insanity, would tax any professional.
Wilfrid Neill battled hard in this part, and the
support was good, especially in the trial-scene —
far more convincing than a law-court usually is on
the stage. There was a personal triumph for a
new recruit, T. Nave, as an elderly, fussy law
clerk. It is a fat part (Edmund Gwenn played it
in London), notably where in the witness-box the
old boy treats counsel and Judge as his fellow-
referees in the great match, Grown v. Prisoner:
“I’m sure your Lordship doesn’t wish me to
repeat what the third party said ? ’’—and so on.
* * * *
After Hugh Ward’s farewell (in the scare-
crow scene as given by him at Drury Lane) the
Adelaide Royal closed its doors. It reopened
them for two amateur evenings of that reliable
laugh-bringer, “ Charley’s Aunt ” ; and after that
Roberts came with “ The Prince Chap,” the sen-
timental and somewhat treacly domestic drama
which requires two infant phenomena and one
grown-up to play the heroine at different stages,
all three successfully pretending to be some years
younger than they are. The inebriated hound
has gone from the Tivoli, much regretted. It
would be interesting to know just vvhat
he thinks he is doing in his great tipsy
scene. A lady named Yetta, just off the mail-
boat, is now doing some daring wire-walking and
dancing, and Julian Rose is talking through his
nose about Levinsky’s wedding. West’s Pictures
have mostly been imported brands. The Empire
has specialised in local Strike pictures, and others
of the newly-established Henley-on-Torrens. The
absurdly boisterous December nights have tried
hard to blow the various Pierrots off the beaches,
but the Dandies still hang on at the Exhibition.
Other shows vary from “The Messiah” and carols
to Stadium stoush.
“ Kaifcangata’s ” complaint:—
Wandering through the Sydney Botanic Gardens at
this time of year, X am always struck by the entire
absence of any of the most popular and beautiful of our
native flowers. The waratah, the king lily, the flannel
flower and the Christmas bush all grow freety in private
grounds and gardens ; but never a specimen of these do
I see in the people’s Botanic. Why? The Westralian
boronia (to say nothing of the exquisite local variety, with
its amazing recuperative powers) would doubtless also
flourish in Sydney. The cheap gibe would be to ask
whether the Curator can’t spare the time from his occu-
pation of demolishing trees of ancient growth and superb
habit. I prefer to believe that he doesn’t give us the
native flowers because he doesn’t know how badly we
want t hem.
Teesdale Smith, timber-man and railway
contractor, who lately collected the Westralian
Fatmen, so that they might curse the Common-
wealth referenda in chorus, was next day in-
terviewed by the Perth morning paper. Re-
ferring to the Port Hedland-Marble Bar railway—
for which Smith is the contractor—he said: “If
Asiatic labor had been used on the line from Port
Hedland to Marble Bar the work would have
been finished by this time, and for the
same cost the line could have been
carried straight out to Nullagine.” From
this the workers and White Australians of
the Commonwealth may get a hint as to the pro-
bable reason why some people don’t want indus-
trial affairs handed over to the Commonwealth.
In short—•“ Vote No, and give Mr. Teesdale
Smith the right to employ Chinese or Japs or
Indian coolies on his Australian railway con-
tracts.”
The colder climate of Maoriland hasn’t
reduced the size of Peter Bowling’s head yet.
Speaking at Wellington recently he said :
He intended to reach the wage-earners to deliver his
message and do all in his power to lift his fellow-man and
make him master and ruler of the world. (Cheers.)
Probably his [Peter’s] methods might be objectionable.
He had no fault to find with those who objected to them ;
but why, in the name of ail that was fair and just, did
they not specify wherein he was deficient? Why had it
been published broadcast that the Wellington Trades
Council disapproved of his methods?
A voice: Only one official.
Mr. Bowling : Well, that official ought to be checked
or chastised, or the Trades Council will cease to exist.
And then Peter’s halo rattled in the storm of
applause like a kerosene tin trying to drag a bull-
pup’s tail from the bull-pup’s body.
AT POVERTY POINT.
“Jean”: Hush !—not a word !—the Taits are giving-
private fliokergraphic stances at Government House,
Melbourne. The first show occurred the other Tuesday
evening, and it is understood that another was to hap-
pen last Friday night. The latter performance, it is
said, Was to include some nice “candied” films for the
special delectation of Lady Dudley, and also an intimate
view of the Jeffries-Johnson disturbance for the chaste
enjoyment of Lord Dudley and company. This arrange-
merit saved the vice-regal folk from crowding in publicly
to study a picture which, however, is quite inoffensive,
and could be safely served up as an extra at a Pleasant
Sunday Afternoon.
“ Busk ” : Melbourne has seen nearly 40 different sub-
jects treated in Christmas pantomimes, but the variety
was mostly in yore-time. Here’s the list: “Aladdin,
“Adamanta,” “Arabian Nights,” “ Babes in the Wood,
“Beauty and the Beast,” “ Conundrum Castle,” “ Cin-
derella," “ Djin Djin,” “Enchanted Island,” “ Froggie
Would a-Wooing Go,” “ Forty Thieves,” “Gulliver,”
“ Goody Two Shoes,” “ House that Jack Built,” “ Harle-
quin L.5.D.,” “ Humpty Dumpty,” “ Hey Diddle Diddle,’
“Jack and the Beanstalk,” “Jack Horner,” “Jack
Sheppard,” “Jack and Jill,” “Lallaßookh, 4 Magicians
Daughter,” “ Matsa,” “Mother Goose,” “Red Riding
Hood,” “ Riquet with the Tuft,” “Robin Hood,” “Rule
of Three,” “ Sinbad,” “ Sleeping Beauty,” “ Santa Claus,”
THE ANGELIC MAXWELL .
at present disturbing Brisbane
with melodrama.
“Twinkle Little
Star,” “ Tom the
Piper’s Son,” and
“Valentine and
Orson.”
“L.H.P.” : Of
course, we fret
only the merest
glimpse of “ Mad-
ame Tussaud’s ”
in “The Whip.”
Of the “glories”
of the place there
is no suggestion.
The apple of the
owners’ eye is a
wax model of
Robespier re’s
head —a wonder-
ful piece of work-
manship. Robe-
spierre went to
the guillotine
with his broken
jaw swathfd in
a white linen
cloth. An hour
after the knife
fell, the un-
shrinlting Tus-
saud lady took
his head in her
lap and made
the cast which
is now shown.
There is the
same lad y’s
model of Marat
in his bath.
“ They came for
me,” said the first
boss of Tussaud’s
show, in her
memoirs, “ to go
to the house
where Marat
lived, for the
purpose of mak-
ins: a cast of his features, for he had just been
killed by Charlotte Corday. He was still warm, and his
bleeding- body and the cadaverous aspect of the fiend
made me feel very sick ; but I had to perform the task.”
Marat’s model lies in the very bath he was murdered in.
Westminster Abbey only welcomes the famous. Madame
Tussaud’s has a niche for the infamous too. Crippen will
be the latest guest. Our own Ned Kelly and Deeming
are there. The show first came to London during the
stormy years following the French revolution, and has re-
mained ever since. The present proprietors—two brothers
—represent the fourth Tussaud generation.' They always
like to have a sitting, if they can. But if they can’t, they
work on photographs.
“ Busk ”: It is desperately hard for professionals to
work up a pantomime that starts a week before Christ-
mas. The afflatus of Boxing Night is required for a send
off. So the first week of Williamson’s “ Jack and the
Beanstalk ” only amounted to dress rehearsals. At the
same time I marvel at the perfection with which Coventry
evoked it. On the first night one might imagine it had
been running a month ; not a word could be edged in
about “ the hitches inseparable from a first nighi’s per-
formance.” More glory cannot be imagined crammed in ;
the difficulty must be in taking off and putting on clothes.
It is the stagecraft that hits so hard. Thecrashingdown
of the Giant’s Castle, for instance, is almost incredibly
skilful work. As for the people, next to Kenyon, I would
put the Panzer acrobats and thirdly the Doherty Sisters,
in a vaudeville turn. Their gags are sharp. “There’s
Brisket, the lightweight.” “A boxer?” “No, a
butcher.” “ There’s Goldbug. Ah, his wealth is tainted
in two ways.’ ’“How?” “ Well, it ain’t yours and it ain’t
mine.” Sybil Arundale is different from all other Jacks.
No wig of golden curly shavings—just her own dark hair.
And then she is more serious than otherwise.
“Vic.”: To me the most powerful showman for that
kind of thing at the Theatrical Charities’ Carnival was
E. I. Cole. First I met him with his hair, then without
his hair, and now he has got the locks again. His show-
tent was a fine theatre for all the stars of the opera com-
panies and other Melbourne organisations. More striking
are the seven houses on wheels, in which he totes his
dramatic company round Australia. All very well fur-
nished ; and there was the proud Cole doffing his King
O’Malley sombrero, with “Go through every house in my
town, ladies and gentlemen. Nice, ain’t they?” “My
word ! ” says everybody. I thought of the days when the
Edouin Family travelled in this caravan style over the
Victorian goldfields. But to-day—well, it isn’t “ class.”
Alfred Hill, the Maoriland composer who brewed the
music of “ A Moorish Maid,” was struggling to get the
first basses to take their breath in the same place ; but
there was one purple-faced man who would not go right.
Finally, Hill had to stop and tell the blower of brass about
his mistake. Leaning over his conductor’s desk, he said
as calmly as he could, “Excuse me, Mr. Blanky, you are
not taking your breath in the right place.” Mr. Blanky
flushed with annoyance, but cheered up visibly when a
voice from the second tenors, immediately in front,
replied, “Oh yes, he did 1 ” “ But I’m sure he didn’t!”
cried Hill. “Oh, but he did!” retorted the tenor.
“ How dp you know?” demanded Hill. “Becausel smelt
it! ” said the tenor, emphatically.
That heavy-weight journal, London Saturday Review,
recently contained a notice of “Count Hannibal,” Oscar
Asche’s bellowdrama. After referring to the robustious-
ness of the play in perfumed prose, the writer exclaimed :
“ How they must have loved it all in the Australian
Bush!” They did, they did ! Oscar’s record seasons at
the Theatre Royal, Tibooburra, and the Lyceum Theatre,
Croajingolong, will, in fact, never be eiased from
memory’s fly-leaf.
P’ran’s new picture-theatre, the Lyric, is some leagues
ahead of the ordinary flicker-palace. Something like
2500 people can eat peanuts in it simultaneously, ana as
they chew they can gaze up in rapture at a beautiful
color scheme on repousse steel panels, from which the
lovely head of the Venus de Milo peeps down shyly at the
huge auditorium.” ( Vide managerial guff.) A really in-
teresting feature of the new playhouse is that the screen,
which fills the frame of the proscenium—the stage may
come bv-and-bye when the picture craze sags—is made oi
“Mack?’ “Mack” is a builders’ composition, invented
to shove bricks out of partition walls, and it is alleged to
be just the thing for picture-sheets. If it turns out so, it
will be a mighty improvement on the inflammable rag
that is mostly stretched ahead of the paying guests at
flicker shows.
In the early future Melbourne Princess’s will be piled
with dead, and blud will overflow from its scuppers. In
short, George Marlow has secured a six years’ lease of the
Spring-street Theatre ; and where George Marlow is, bel-
lowdrama is not far away. Presumably he will work the
Melbourne house in conjunction with the place which has
risen on the site of Sydney’s old Paddy’s Market.
“ Busk ”: A new Boy is passed round every Christmas.
Williamson’s “Jack and the Beanstalk ” would never do
without a brand new Principal Tights. Why? Have we
never found the real Clicquot and Gold Top? Australia
can produce a Melba and Castles, even an Asche, but not
a Principal Boy. Yet it used to. There were Nellie
Stewart, Maggie Oliver, Julia Mathews, and others
reckoned better than English, you know. Even with an
English one, why must we insist that the bran is gone
out of the doll in one year ? Look how London hung on to
Nellie Farren.
“McGinty”: If the cocky in town Christmas
misses the fence on which he is wont to perch and
ponder, let him pay a visit to the “ thripenny ” section of
a suburban picture emporium and he’ll soon feel homely ;
for the seats are usually constructed of narrow hardwood
battens, guaranteed to leave a pattern on which music
can be written. Then again, as a student of eternal
sameness, the suburban flicker music will appeal to him.
Personally, I’ve witnessed 38 murders and 22 reforma-
tions to the strains of the Intermezzo from “ Cavalleria
Rusticana.” If it doesn’t happen shortly that someone is
garrotted to the accompaniment of “The Holy City ” or
sandbagged to the strains of “Knocked ’em in the Old
Kent Road,” I’ll forego the flicker counter and buy my
peanuts somewhere else.
“Sr.": Will somebody show cause why the cove, or
whatever he is, who announces the items at cinemato-
graph shows should not be warned off all stages? His
unintelligible remark always sounds like this: “Ladies
and Genelmen ; the nex fllim, whicher about perouf
wamba is entiled the wayda saloppa uska cluck burr.”
Every time he does that, some blob at the back of me
or beside me pulls my coat and asks, “ Whattidy say ? ”
and while I am replying that the only person who knows
what he said is not in the building, the machine starts
to blazon the title of the picture on the sheet. Even if
he were intelligible it would be a waste of cove, especially
when he could be given a job switching on the electric
fans or imitating a railway engine behind the screen. He
could even be given the sack.
“Hypo”: This picture business is in for closer inspec-
tion, and, probably, considerable repression before long.
A recent cable told how the Canadian Government had
started to enrol the army of British North America, only
to find that 75 per cent, of the levies were suffering from
“ tobacco heart” and “ movingpicture eye.” Even when
the film shows no flicker, the thing is there, and doing
deadly work in the way of impairing marksmanship. Just
now the pictures are the thing; heaps of people
would sooner go without a meal one night a
week than miss the regular visit to the show.
And the eyesight of the regular picture fiend
suffers to a degree that is limited only by the extent of
his attendance. Also, Chief Sec. Macdonell (N.S. W.) has
been casting bis uninjured optic over the mechanical
side of the shows. He finds that, in most cases, the films
are of the highly inflammable sort—stuff which explodes
like gunpowder ; and that few of the “palaces” in the
suburbs have any safeguards in case of fire. The big
metropolitan places use a good many films of the non-
inflammable sort, which, if they catch fire, burn like
brown paper, and make no blaze and no explosion ; and
even when they are of the other kind the films are con-
tained in metal boxes in which they can burn out without
doing any damage, save raising the already unpleasant
temperature around the operator. Some of the big places
are fitted with special flues over the operating machine,
so that in the event of a blaze the whole of the flame,
heat and burning material is sucked up in a blast of air
and consumed as it goes up the chimney. The Chief
Sec. has notified the suburban showman that he must
follow suit, and use non-inflammable films, or stick
his pictures in a strongly-made metal box which will
withstand the explosion and hold the incandescent mass
while it burns out. Either that or he must provide the
safety flue—which is probably what he will do in most
cases.
“Stargazer”: Have you tumbled to the methods of
vaudeville managers in selecting new and unheard-of
talent hereabouts? Have often been at theatres and
halls lately where unannounced and gratuitous items
were rung in, and have noticed the gifted management
and an enlightened committee ranging up in front to
narrowly watch developments on the stage, while keeping
a wide-open ear for the verdict of the audience. That
unrecorded and unexpected turn is generally Something
Awful, and usa rule the surprised audience hasn’t time
to collect its wits and look for missiles before the remains
are hurriedly removed by the stage manager. If the per-
formance is borne with ordinary patience by the general
public, the new talent appears in the hills a few nights
later, decorated with unblushing adjectives of superlative
praise.
London news tells of the death of Frank Emery, who
stage-managed for Williamson and Musgrove in the Ws.
“ Tne Forty Thieves ” panto, was his last production in
these parts.
“A.E.C.” : “ Melb ” (B. 8/12/10) is wrong in his refer-
ence to the part Phil Beck took in “Madame Midas.”
He played the villain, a Frenchman named Gaston
Vaudeloup, who commits suicide with the same poison
he used on his victim, namely, extract of hemlock.;
Before committing suicide he exclaims : “And now to
solve ze great problem.” Which Phil himself shortly
proceeded to do.
Someone has had the nerve to put on the music-hall
stage in London “The Third Degree a “ sketch ” run-
ning a mere half-hour, and having nothing to do with the
play except that it shows the torturing of a suspected
but innocent prisoner at police-headquarters in N’York:
So, like “ A Squaw Man ” the real “Third Degree” will
have to take a fresh name when it reaches London.
“Theos”: The Sydney dailies are doing their best to
boost “The Whip,”' and it will take some boosting. I
read about the magnificence of the smash-up scene, and
the cheers it evoked. A misprint, I assure you, so far as
the gallery was concerned on the first night. It should
be spelled'with a“J.” Allowing for it being a “first-
night ” (though the play has been running for 10 weeks
in Melbourne, and a week has been spent rehearsing in
Sydney), and excusing such trifles as the winning post’s
refusal to finish the race, and the delay of the horse-box
in falling to pieces after the collision, the acting was, in
many cases, unconvincing, and the walls of the waxworks
rocked ominously. There is no need to comment on the
love-making of the play- The interjections of the
gaileryites showed plainly that it was not the way we do
it in Australia.

PENFOLD'S
WINES
A. S. Meek, a naturalist who has been
wandering about Papua, the Solomons and other
islands for many years, lately set out to fossick
the Snow Mountains in Dutch New Guinea for
bugs, birds and butterflies, in the interests chiefly
of the Rothschild who makes a hobby of skewered
insects. Meek had hoped to be the first white
man to explore the mountains ; but a Dutch ex-
pedition got there first, and reported the usual
pygmies. Meek has only once been heard from
since he got into the neighborhood. The Dutch
Resident at Merauke, the capital, gave him every
facility, put a Government launch at his disposal,
and helped him with some Borneo canoes to get
up the rivers, which he describes as sprinkled
with rapids and other excitements. Even this
old wayfarer grew enthusiastic over the scenery.
But he didn’t see much prospect of Rothschild
getting many skewered insects—
To work this place as one can work Papua (British New
Guinea) or the Solomons is quite impracticable, as there
are no natives for carrying, or next to none. This applies
to the inlands ; on the coast they are very numerous,
but here we have not as yet seen an\c What few are ever
here are nomadic, and their temporary shelters small and
primitive. The Snow Mountains are very impressive.
Here, within four or five degrees of the Equator, the
precipitous peaks are snow-capped always; and great
fields of dazzling white lie in the valleys. The view in
the mornings is especially grand.
Some day the Australian tourist may push in
there too. Just at present he will probably let
Meek have it all to himself. Merauke, by the
way, Meek found “a flourishing Malayan-Java-
nese township, with perhaps 30 Europeans, who
were exceedingly kind and obliging.” This is on
the south coast of the island ; you might tumble
on to it if you fell out of the Gulf of Carpentaria.

THE HAT OF TODAY.
A new Australian industry is expected to
have an early birth. Recently the trawler En-
deavor returned to Melbourne with some fine
specimens of deep-sea flathead, one of the most
tasty of submarine beasts. The haul was subse-
quently inspected by an inquisitive party, who
saw possibilities of canning the fish for foreign
export and home consumption. As an experi-
ment he tinned several of the animals, and was so
successful that he will shortly commence to solder
up the creatures in bulk—provided he can make
arrangements to get the bulk in a methodical
manner.

Some parsons, in noting cases of hardship,
endeavor to see further than the opposite side of
the collection-plate and discover a reason for it
all. A Methody missionary, whose beat is eastern
Victoria and southern N.S.W., wrote last week to
Sydney D.T. and cited two particularly horrible
examples of cow-farming slavery he had come
across. No. 1 example was a family of six, who
worked every day from 4 a.m. to 7 p.m., and
thereby managed to earn £2 12s. per month, or
Bs. Bd. each every four weeks. No. 2 example
was a family of
seven, who, by
working the
same inhuman
hours and milk-
ing more cows,
managed to earn
a whole £4 per
month about
11s. 3d. each.
They existed—
these hard
manual workers
—almost exclus-
ively on bread
and tea, a diet
on which the
average clerk or
office -worker
would break
down in a
month. Unhap-
pily, the mis-
sionary was un-
wise enough to
mention, with
regard to No. 1
pang of serfs whose earnings are not enough to
meet their food bill, that “ the owner lives in
affluence.” No leader appeared in the D.T. about
it, and his letter was interred in the D.T.’s cellar.
One has to dredge the D.T.’s fish co'umn and dig
persistently in its cellar for the really interesting
news these days.
“ Sardonyx ” : “ Sasana-Dhaja ” (to the
carnal, Mister E. H. Stevenson, of Yarmouth),
the Buddhist monk at present sojourning and lec-
turing in Sydney, is apparently trying to get two
heads under one hood. Buddhism
he calls with one breath “ the
greatest of the world’s religions,”
and with the next he says it is not
a religion at all, but merely a
system of moral philosophy. It
seems very much as if this member
of the “oldest order of monks in
the world ” is hard put to it to
bolster up his assertion that Bud-
dhism is quite compatible with
Christianity. Some of the funda-
mental maxims of the latter cer-
tainly were anticipated by Buddha ;
but,] for all that. Buddhism is
Pantheism, which has always been
held a vile heresy by the Christian
Church. “ A man can be a Chris-
tian,” says Stevenson-Dhaja, “and
live quite naturally the life of a
Buddhist monk.” Doubtless ; but that wouldn’t
make him a Buddhist any more than crawling
on his hands and feet would make a man a frilled
lizard.

About a terrible struggle for sixpence :
Barnett, S.M., sitting at a Sydney Court on Dec. 21 1
finally nailed up a case which had been left open by the
ex-Wade management. Under the Minimum Wage Act
passed by the Wade Government it was provided, amongst
other things, that if little milliners were worked more
than 48 hours a week, tea-money should be paid them.
So when Fluff and Feathers, Ltd., worked one of its em-
ployees over the time limit, which fell, in this instance,
at 9 o’clock on a Saturday morning, without handing
out Sixpence for tea, the Act rose up and protested.
S.M. ißarnett dismissed the protest on the ground
that tea-money meant evening-tea money, and was not
even a distant relative of breakfast-money. Wade, who
at that time had not been thrown out of the job of
Attorhev-General, explained that what he meant in pass-
ing the Act was that the money was neither for evening
tea nor early breakfast particularly ; it was just plain
meal-money to be “blewed” at convenience. He ex-
pressed this view to the Supreme Court, and was promptly
awarded a verdict. But Fluff and Feathers weren’t satis-
fied, and insisted on the sprat being handed up for the
inspection of the High Court. That weighty body
told the State Court, in effect, that it ought to
be sawing wood. Tea money, it was clear, was
tea money and nothing else. It wasn’t afternoon-tea
naoney or morning-tea money, or gridirons, or grindstones,
or prophets, or measles, or anything else. So Fluff and
Feathers were handed the sixpence, and the State was
sent out for a cart to carry home the bill of Costs. Last
week S.M. Barnett formally dismissed the case, and
charged 6s. more for the compliment.
“ The Snake ” : It is high time, or, to put
it more commonly, the time is now ripe, for some-
one to give the farmer the chat, fair dinkum or
straight griffen. Wherefore, I arise. By dint of
an abuse of public ignorance, combined with the
exigencies of political starvelings, the farmer has
deluded the citizens of all countries into the
belief that he is :
(1) An honest man.
(2) The backbone, etc.
(3) A sturdy yeomanry.
(4) A man that will stand no nonsense.
(5) A man that is developing the great natural
resources.
(6) A man that pays the highest wages.
(7) A man after the Lord’s own heart.
He says so, and he would be a splendid man if it
were true. But—
(a) The farmer is a rogue.
(b) 1 know.
(c) If you buy grain from a farmer it is never up to
sample.
(d) If you buy a crop of potatoes the bags are half full
of soil and stones.
(e) His troubles about the natural resources.
(f) He burns millions of feet of valuable timber in
order to feed 10 cows.
What sort of a man is that ? Further :
(I.) He pays the lowest possible wages ; if he gets half
a slant he’ll pay none at all.
(II.) His attitude towards the tariff (which is the true
backbone of a country) is that of a rascal. He bellows
fora prohibitive duty on everything that he produces and
sells, and howls for Freetrade on all kinds of machinery
and implements that he has to buy.
(III.) He chokes with indignation against State Social-
ism ; yet he cadges State land, State seed, State stock,
State agricultural colleges, State railways, State irriga-
tion, State advances to settlers, and State anything else
that will help him swell his personal banking account.
I repeat: What sort of a kind of a man do you
call that? Bah ! Again :
* He is not a man after the Lord’s own heart.
t If the Lord sees fit to send the rain when it is not in
accordance with the farmer’s view's, what does the Lord
get? Nothing.
J If the Lord in His wisdom withholds the rain when
the farmer reckons it should be turned on, does the
farmer bow to the Divine will? Not a bow. He
announces that the seasons are going all to blazes nowa-
days ; and speaks of the Manager of the Universe as if
He were a station cook who was on a prolonged jag.
And so I ask you : What sort of a man is the
farmer? I reckon he’s a plain cow.

Hitherto, most of the agitation to secure
better treatment for Black Brother, especially in
the North, has been based on the plea that Black
Brother’s interests demand it. But White
Brother’s interests begin to yell for it as
well. In his last report Judge Herbert, lately
Government Resident in the Northern Terri-
tory, makes the awful allegation, “on the
authority of the Government Medical Officer,”
that “of oyer 100 female aboriginals around
settled districts examined by him, only one
was found to be free ” from the trouble
that needn’t be specified. It is not much
use telling the vigorous young Australian whom
we are urging to go north, to disregard the black
sister who hangs out in his neighborhood. The
only safe thingfor him and the virile white race that

shift the lady and all her tribe on to reserves, and
to make it gaol of the most emphatic kind for a
white man to push inside the boundary.

The poor old Evening Bloodstain cannot
realise that an accident need not necessarily be
accompanied by loss of life to lie appalling. There
was a frightful crash in King-street, Sydney, one
afternoon last week. People ran out of shops and
pubs and found a lorry jammed slantwise between
two trams. When the first rush of excitement
had subsided, and the extent of the damage had
been ascertained, white-faced men said wildly
that it was “a d d shame,” and went home
boiling. But the tragedy did not get the
headlines it demanded, and for which an indig-
nant public thirsted. Here they are :

Thin is the stem of the red, red rose,
And slender the stalk of the lily,
And the garden of girls to envy grows
At the hobbled charms of Milly.
Rivers of frill and seas of lace
Have foamed and rippled round me,
But never a surge of their wilder grace
With such strict cords had bound me.
Airs with the summer’s breath are sweet,
With blossom the winds are laden,
As knightly I walk the dangerous street
In search of a fettered maiden.
Oh, where does my damsel hop to-day,
And where shall her errant find her,
With the love-smile dawning in ej r es of grey,
O’er the slender silks that hind her?
Swaying with fear on her wind-blown stalk
I shall meet my blossom tender ;
While her trustful heart with my own shall walk,
First aid shall my swift hand render.
Helpless as fair, I shall pluck m3 T rose,
I shall gather my folded lily,
While the garden of girls to envy grows
At the tubular charms of Milly.

the* crown can be dented or
creased in the same way.
The brim is unbound, 3 y 2
inches wide, and we have it in
Mid Grey, Fawn and Stone
Brown.
A great hat either for Town

“ Monfcalex ” : There’s a lot of plain horse-
sense about the new marriage-law of the Portu-
guese Republic. Divorce is obtainable by mutual
consent in the case of a pair who, being over 25
years of age, have discovered, after a two years’
trial, that they don’t go well in double harness,
another year’s test being obligatory before the tie
is finally snipped. Compare the simple reason-
ableness of this with the promptness with which,
under British law, a decree is refused upon the
least suspicion that both parties want it. In-
sanity, pronounced incurable after three years’
duration, is now, in Portugal, a valid ground for
divorce. Certainly there’s something to be said
on the other side of that. Testifying recently
before the English Divorce Commission, Crichton
Browne, the doyen of European alienists, was
dead against “ incurable insanity ” as a divorce-
ground ; he confessed that even he would hardly
venture to pronounce any case incurable, and
maintained that, since insanity is really a bodily
disease with mental manifestations, any other
serious disease would furnish an equally valid
reason for bursting the tie. Compare the great
man’s diffidence about incurability with the cock-
sureness of some medical small fry in other places.

Public buildings are not numerous in
Papua, and where Justice stands to-day Pub-
lic Works may stand to-morrow. They are all
good fellows, and try to oblige each other—some-
times. Sometimes they succeed ; sometimes they
make a mess of things. Not long ago a repre-
sentative of the law was sitting in judgment on a
native who had stolen a stick of tobacco, when an
officer of one of the' other departments entered
without knowing that the Court was in session,
and without removing his hat. At once there was
trouble. “Jones,” said the Bench, “if you don’t
uncover your head, I will commit you for con-
tempt. What do you mean by coming into my
court with your hat on ? I have a good mind to
send you to gaol now.” Grabbing his hat, Jones
stammered his ignorance arid his sorrow. Then,
when the first shock was over, and realising that
the office was a common one and that he had as
much right there with his hat on as the Law had
to be there with his off, he replaced his lid and
invited the energetic but inexperienced young
beak to come out and have a drink. What they
drank has never yet been revealed ; all that is
known is that the Court was hurriedly adjourned
for something.
“Trotter”: I mentioned a few months
ago that Colonial Secretary Crewe had sent a
letter to the Australian Postmaster-General point-
ing out the advantage of the new Andean rail-
road, Valparaiso to Buenos Ayres, which might
make a saving of four or five days with Australian
mails. I termed this ignorance in fancying that
mails could be sent regularly from Auckland to
Valparaiso. But the thing may be done some
day. I glean that there are even now the begin-
nings of a movement in Argentina and_ Chile to
establish a regular service between \ alparaiso
and Auckland. It is not altogether a vague
notion, for the company that is pondering it con-
trols both the railway and the steam service
between Buenos Ayres and London. The pro-
gress of the Panama Canal seems to be the chief
stumbling block. It would not, of course, be busi-
ness to scheme a steamboat line between Auck-
land and Valparaiso for a long time ahead, if the
Canal were certain to quash it. The London
Times has just sent a highly-qualified professional
engineer to give a candid opinion about the Canal.
After carefully going over the works, with every
help from the authorities, he declares that the
Canal will infallibly open in January, 1915, and
will be virtually completed long before the close
of 1914.

The ex-Contingenter seems incapable of
growing up. The other night a body of alleged
S’African warriors marched behind a fife and
drum band composed of Boy Scouts to Cam-
meray Park, North Sydney, where they lit a
“ camp fire,” and sat down to discuss the hen and
harmonium foray of 10 years back. The N.S.W.
“S’African Soldiers’ Association” is said to
number 250. There is comfort in the thought
that many of them are probably bogus
warriors who never saw a musical instru-
ment commandeered, unless by a bailiff under a
District Court judgment order. Numbers of re-
turned contingenters are—unless the newspaper
reports of proceedings at Quarter Sessions and
elsewhere lie—in one or other of the State gaols.
Others have fled the country leaving writs, wives,
children, debts, curses and other things behind
them. Many have died natural deaths. A few
may have been hanged. One way and another
the balance of genuine contingenters left us
is probably extremely small, while such as do
exist are none too anxious to advertise their
part in the disgraceful blunder. Still, the fact
remains that a body of male citizens was found
willing to sit round an imitation campfire in the
capacity of one-time S’African warriors. The
intellectual calibre, not to mention the sense of
humor, of grown men who would find joy in that
sort of thing is something too vast for ordinary
conception.

In a brief, dry seism oparagraph the daily
papers record some faint, far shiver of this aged
earth ; but it is all dry bones till presently the
cable or the tardier mail brings news of the start-
ling things which made the old globe shudder
these thousands of miles away. One five-line
message lately was to the effect that, after an
earthquake shock, a small island in Ilopanga
Lagoon, close to the city of San Salvador, sank
like an iron pot and took with it 170 people into
unknown depths. A day or so behind the cable
THE COMFORTER.
ANXIOUS OLD LADY: “I say, my good man, is this bout going up or down?"
DECKHAN D: “ Well, she’s a leaky old tub, mum, so I shouldn’t wonder if she was going down.
But then, again, her b'ilers ain’t none too good, so she might go up!”
came the steamer Makambo with tidings of a
South Sea earth-shiver. On November 13—an
unlucky day—the island of Santo commenced to
shake as if the Devil were trying to pull it up by
the roots. Houses crumbled; people became
drunk and fell on their knees; tables walked ;
land-slides slid ; tidal waves fled hissing inland,
like Tory slanderers pursuing the jieople with
dead stinking fish; the coast-line hurriedly
started to dress like a file of nervous recruits;
growing crops jumped out of the soil; and the
tops of mountains fell off like the cork-ends of
beer bottles struck with a hatchet. Unfortu-
nately, the fleeing ’quake doesn’t scribble down
the lurid details as it wriggles past like a distin-
guished travelling fantod ; it merely signs the
visitors’-book in a painful spidery scrawl which
suggests that it has been drinking heavily, and
trembles away into stillness like a homing ine-
briate going for his last train.

“He married her on spec?”
“ Yes, she had a dot! ”
A question has arisen re the advisability
of shoving certain city landlords into the criminal
court with a view to finding out if there is a white-
washed cell to fit them. These persons have not
only given notice that the rent is to be raised, but
have rashly stated in writing that the deed is forced
upon them by the Federal land-tax. This is the
landlord’s little way of trying (1) to make a profit
for himself, and (2) to firing discredit on the
Federal Labor party ; but it is possible to overdo
the thing. When the increase of rent is three or
six times the amount of the tax the business looks
shady, and when the deed is done by a compara-
tively small landlord, who doesn’t pay any tax at
all, it looks shadier. If the landlord simply raised
the rent because he felt that way it would be
legalised piracy ; but when he extracts additional
rent by a lie, it is so like getting money under false
pretences that some people are making inquiry as
to legal proceedings.
“The Pariah ”: It’s the same
old filth, but as the filthiness
tends rather to increase than
otherwise, I want to mention
it again. Right here in Upp.ih
Haw-Hawthorn (Yic.) is a
street almost entirely devoted
to Chinese, their gardens and
their evil ways. Yesterday
evening I heard the Bast a-
calling, so I walked the
length of that street to see
the squalor in-miniature of
the China that I used to
know. I left the call dead
in a big open drain. This
is what killed it. Two
girls, probably 13 and 15
years of age, were talking
to two Pongs in front of
a kipsy. Before I got
along to them one girl
and a Chow had disap-
peared. I became in-
tensely interested in a
dairv herd that is grazed
on a block between two
gardens. After my quart-
er of an hour’s; cow-
inspection the pair came
out of the shack. There
was some discussion ; and
as many looks were cast
over the intervening 200
yards, I guessed I was
the text, so I started to
walk back. The girls
promptly cleared, and the
two “Johns” discoursed
volubly in Cantonese. Of
course, there’s nothing
wrong in that—perhaps.
But having met the yellow
peril “at home,” I am sus-
picious. The “quang” con-
siders a seventeen-year-old
maiden on the shelf, and brides
of eight and nine are common. I
set out to have a word with the nearest police-
man. He had the matter in hand. It was in a
glass, and I couldn’t interest him in anything else.

“Billy B.” : For a considerable time past
I have been seeking the person, or whatever he
is, who breaks out periodically in the Sydney
papers like this :
A N attempt will be made t 0
Age ot Human Beings was HUNDREDS of years ,
and that nearly all Men were Adonises and nearly all
Women Venuses ; and that all Women had embry
Moustaches. 16.
A N attempt will be made to prove that when Winds
began to blow strongly and the Earth was still
VERY FERTILE, in Winter-time, ENORMOUS quan-
tities of Roly-poly grasses were blown about, most
of which, together with Fronds and Leaves of Trees,
were deposited in many of the Primary Lakes, ana
became coal. 18.
The first of these notices appeared about a year
ago, and since then they have been going strong.
No two are alike, and no attempt has ever been
made to prove anything. I used to think it was
an advertising dodge that would suddenly blossom
into some advice regarding Dr. Pushters 1 ills for
Poled Axes, and the strain of waiting for the ex-
planation so wore upon my nerves that I couldn t get
more than two hours’ drink a night. Bvery time
I made sure of finding the mystery solved I was
faced with something like this :
A N attempt will be made to prove that when the
-H. INFERNAL REGIONS were originally Idled
with a convulsive Mixture of plausible horses shoes
and BLUE RUM, the fixed economical laws were
vacillating across the cold Primeval blazes ; and that
the cogent influence of the North Pole on
ginal Man caused politicians to have webbed-feet
wherewith to swim out. 23.
I give it up. I’ve come to the conclusion that
the Sydney dailies keep a permanent and repro-
ductive lunatic on the premises, and I allow to let
it go at that.

Apparently, the Federal Government’s
policy in the matter of the dry capital is to rush
up as many buildings or dog kennels as possible
in as short a time as may be, regardless of the fact
that, there being no general scheme or detailed
plans, most of them will presently have to be
pulled down. Having been voted £45,000, the
Federal Cabinet has decided to, among other
things, acquire 1700 acres near the proposed city
and erect offices and quarters for the Home Affairs
staff ; provide a power plant; erect brickworks ;
establish a nursery ; provide unlimited (!) water
supply and perfect sanitation for a reserve for
workmen’s cottages ; erect cottages thereon ; pro-
vide accommodation for single men ; erect and
maintain a general store, bakery, butchery and
hotel; provide and equip a hospital; erect
schools, with recreation reserves, etc., etc.—for
£45,000! It is all either a Red Indian burlesque
or a tinkering in a tuppenny fashion with a sub-
ject that is obviously too big for the hot-air ex-
perts who are tackling it.
A TIP FROM GREENLAND.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
If an Esquimau man grows tired of his wife he simply
tells her that there is not room for her in his igloo.—
Bulletin (Red, Page), 22/12/'lO.
The unprogressive Esquimau
Knows naught, of cars or trains,
He does not w r ash, his ice-bound home
Is innocent of drains,
And yet his legislation proves
That he is blessed with brains.
In those bleak, wind-swept regions where
He lives his frigid life,
Amid the smells and seals and things
With which the place is rife.
He has evolved a matchless plan
To scotch the nagging wife.
He does not smash the crockery,
Or utter language blue,
Or hurl round chairs, or seek his club,
As mere Caucasians do ;
He simply says : “ My dear, there is
No room in this igloo.”
And straightway she must sally forth,
In silence and alone,
And lose herself for evermore—
Which system can be shown
To be a thousand miles ahead
Of any that we own.
The marvel is that he confines
His scheme to wives who prove
Intolerable. Logic’s laws
Suggest he should remove
All nuisances on self-same lines,
And send them forth to rove.
The local Wade, the Wood, the Dill,
The Cook are Curses who
Must cause a heap of trouble. Them
The Greenlander should shoo
In firm, though courteous language from
His national igloo.
The State Rights crank, who prophesies
* That anarchy will loom
Unless the cause of Fat is won,
Should hear the voice of Doom ;
“Leave the Igloo. Get out I For you
We haven’t any room.”
It is a plan which others than
The simple Esquimau
Might well adopt. What bliss if here
A mere hint were enow
To cause our Blights to rise in haste
And pack their things and go!

A year or so back The Bulletin discovered
that the Westralian Government had made repairs to a
glass-house in which the Agricultural Department was
breeding some, pest-destroying parasites, and had paid
for those repairs with loan money. It now seems that
the Government of the same State is using loan money
to pay for the meals which it hands out to new arrivals
at the Immigrants’ Home. Worse than that, while
the cost of the meal is charged to loan, any payments re-
ceived from the immigrants are credited to revenue.
This is simply another way of dipping the hand into the
loan money-bag, and then emptying the handful into
the revenue monev-bag. If a private trader did it, and
got into the Buk uptcy Court—as he would be likdy
to—the Judge would send him to gaol almost for
a certainty. It is exactly the same as if a bank accepted
deposits, lent them out, and then, on getting repaid,
divided the money among its own shareholders instead
of repaying the people to whom the money belonged.
The Auditor-General refers to the matter in his
last report:—“ The receipts in connection with the home
have been credited to revenue. Although this is in
accordance with law, the principle is bad, because, if one
shilling were expended on a meal, the cost would be met
from loan.” He introduces this with the remark : “ Pre-
sumably hon. members are well aware of what is being
done.” The question is whether the States’ creditors
are. And it is not a matter only for them either. Posterity
is interested. The present generation is buying things
with loan, and selling those things, and using the pro-
ceeds as revenue, so as to reduce the taxation now pay-
able. But the loan will have to be repaid. The things
represented by the loan will long since have disappeared,
hut the I O U will come up for payment all the same.
The Auditor-General says the principle is bad. This
paper goes farther, and says that the practice is not only
disgracefully unpatriotic, but also positively dishonest.

This is just about the greediest trustee co. in Australia.
Of its profit it now divides about 66 per cent.; while the
Perpetual, of Sydney, is content to scatter 34 per cent.,
the T. E. and A., of Melbourne, 63 per cent., and the
Adelaide Executors 22 per cent.—and the T. E. and A.’s
div. is only 7 per cent, on the capital, which to
some extent excuses it for taking as much as
63 per cent, of the profit. The trustee co.
doesn’t often get hit; but when it does get
hit it is likely to be for thousands. Hence the wisdom of
a large reserve fund, even from the shareholders’ point of
view. In fact, the just-mentioned T. E. and A., which
has been through the mill, is plodding steadily ahead
with a determination to make its reserves equal its
capital, and its paid capital is £90,000, while this little
co. has only £lO,OOO paid. It is a deplorable fact that
many people judge a bank’s safety by the size
of its dividend, and it may be that some apply
the same test to trustee cos. But those stupid
people will become less numerous as trustee
cos. become better understood, and, other things being
equal, the business will then go to the office which
has divided the least and reserved the most for the
better protection of its clients. Further, the finan-
cial co. (and especially the financial co. which handles
the widow’s capital) takes risks nowadays when it
blazons forth 20 per cent. divs. A 20 per cent. div.
amounts to a pretty loud invitation to the State to cut
in at the business. But, though the Westralian co. is
open to the one objection mentioned, it has very few
other spots on its record. Its business is increasing rapidly ;
the amount of trust accounts in hand has rushed along
from £251,335 to £1,594,150 in the past five years. Its
own funds are chiefly in premises; the certificate of title
is lodged with the State Treasurer. This may not be
quite as satisfactory a pledge as a bundle of State securi-
ties ; but the private trustee lodges nothing whatever by
way of guarantee, and that is 10,000 times worse.

About the waist-line of that table there is a hint that
the Universal’s capital wasn’t as permanent as it was
alleged to be. The collapse of the boom found the
society suffering the usual after-effects of jim-jams. It
owed about £160,000, all of it out on the usual loans
on real property. In 1894 —but let’s compare that year
with the present to see how things have gone :

“ Everything else ” is mostly loans ; no doubt the greater
part consists of balances owing on purchases. The pre-
sent total of that item is £40,003, which practically
represents the building-society part of the business at pre-
sent. The debentures caused a lot of trouble. The society
struck some holders—in Glasgow chiefly—who didn’t take
things lying down ; and the last arrangement made with
them was that not a penny of dividend should be paid
until the last debenture-holder had got twunty shullins
in the poond. And McDougall had every right in the
world to demand and get it if he could. Next year the
last of this debt will mature ; and the co. won’t have any
trouble to get the money unless some wholly unexpected
brick falls meantime on Australia’s head. As the first
table shows, there are assets nominally representing- the
whole of the liabilities and the whole of the capital (not
written off) and £13,804 besides. The question is, Are
those assets worth 20s. in the £? If they are, then the
20s. share has 255. 6d. worth of assets standing
to its credit. This paper can’t tell from looking at (say)
the item, “ House property in possession, £18,285,”
whether this asset is worth £18,285 or £17,000 or £21,000.
Ilut a steady little profit has been made from sales, and
that looks as though the item was not over-valued in the
books. Also the gross rent return is very satisfactory,
and that also looks as though the assets are not over-
valued. The weakest feature of the whole
business is that over £39,000 is represented by
Oollins-street office premises, notwithstanding severe
writing-down ; and the whole capital, as mentioned
above, is only £50,922. Of course, the offices are bringing
in revenue—very fair revenue too, about 0 per cent.—but
obviously money that is in office freehold can’t also be in
building society advances.

That looks better. “ Profit from sales, etc.,” is a welcome

The latter made it appear that even the severe writing-
down of assets (and capital) a few years ago had not been
severe enough. Queensland has, however, been having a
phenomenal time. Seasons have been good and prices have
been high ; moreover, Northerners have developed much
more confidence in that part of their country and its
future. Whether they will remain sane as well as confi-
dent has yet to be proved. There is such a thing as
over-confidence~the confidence of the borrowing bomn-
ster. Latterly Queensland has been borrowing heavily,
and proposes to go on borrowing ; and that is the time
when mortgage cos. are liable to get into trouble. The in-
flux of millions inevitably produces inflation ; wages jump,
rents follow wages, and capital values follow rents. When
the boom-money is spent, wages fall, and they fall with
all the worse thud because the borrowing usually stops
when the wheel of the seasons turns and bad times succeed
the good ones. And rents and capital values follow
wages down again. Instalments on time-payment pur-
chases stop ; and properties are thrown on the hands of
such cos. as this one. These are the rocks ahead. It by
no means follows that the ship will bump the rocks be-
cause the rocks are there. The most important thing is
to know that they are there ; and this co. seems to be
aware of the rocks. It has about £20,000 of cash and
immediately-convertible securities ; and that suggests
that it knows the dangers, and isn’t rushing
things. Its risks, nevertheless, are pretty large. Its
advances, foreclosures and freeholds are a little
more than double the total of all its own
funds; that is to say, it puts its own £1 and somebody
else’s £1 into shrinkable assets, and guarantees that they
won’t shrink, or, if they do shrink, that the shareholders
will stand the whole racket. And the visible reserves are
only very moderate. If the mortgages and properties fell
in value Is. in the £ below their book value, the whole of
the reserves would be wiped out, and the capital
encroached upon. It is to be hoped, therefore, that the
co. will keep the divs. modest until the reserves grow
much larger than they are at present. Four per cent,
certainly isn’t an overpowering return. But it is far
better to get 4 per cent, and put enough surplus by to
protect your capital, than to get 6 per cent, or more and
presently find that some of your capital has to be written
off as gone for ever.

This 30-year-old co. paid at the rate of 5 per cent, for the
first half of the past year and at the rate of 6 per cent,
for the second half, which may possibly be a hint that,
all being well, the directors intend to make it 6 per
cent, for the future. There is a large and solid
lack of detail about the statement of the co.’s
assets, and it is probably on that account that the in-
vestment market has never taken the figures seriously.
Thus when the co. said it had its capital (£2 per share)
and about 15s. per share in the shape of reserves besides,
the investment market was quoting the shares at a trifle
over £l. And even now, when the accounts show
£36,654 of reserves, the £2 shares are still a long way
under par—which suggests that either the Sydney in-
vestor is a great fool or the published figures are a great
bluff. The co. is chiefly a buyer of suburban land whole-
sale and a seller of it retail; but it has also some city
properties, and it has at least one country estate, Furra-
cabad, near Glen Innes. Apparently the country and
suburban estates are lumped in the accounts ; and the
total, along with other details, is shown in the next com-
parison :

“ Advances, etc.,” evidently include unpaid instalments
on properties. Some sales have certainly been made of
country and suburban properties. It seems, however,
that the proceeds have been put back, probably in the
shape of cottages on suburban estates. The real value of
the assets, as previously mentioned, is doubtful. If the
profit shown for the past year is any criterion, they
should be worth just about what they stand at in the
books. At any rate, on that basis, they show a net
return of over £5 17s. per cent. But a good deal of this
profit may arise from the sale of suburban lands ; and
there may be a great slump in that source of revenue when
the present great activity in building slackens. Hence
the present rate of profit is probably no guide to the real
capital value and normal earning capacity of the assets.
Altogether it is a case in which very few hints of any
value can be got from the published accounts ; and the
man who can get behind the counter, and see what is
going on there, has a tremendous advantage over the
investor who has to stand out on the mat.

The Standard Life Association, Ltd.— This
co., formed in Sydney in 1899, has now almost ceased to
have a separate existence. Most of its £1 shares were
bought during the past year by the Colonial Mutual Life
Office for 15s. apiece ; and thereupon the Standard ceased
taking new business. ' Further, the Colonial Mutual
agreed to take over existing policies ; and most of the
Standard policy-holders have accepted the offer, as this
shows: —
Dec., 1909 .. Policies in force, £1,089,293
June, 1910 .. ~ ~ ~ 204,016
Aug:., 1910 .. ~ ~ ~ 115,007
The revenue account of the Industrial branch shows that
£6472 was paid in claims and £23,363 on account of sur-
renders, the bulk of the latter to the Colonial Mutual on
account of policies transferred to that society. On
account of these payments and a prodigious amount now
charged to expenses, this branch shows a debit of £14,814.
The total paid capital of the Standard was £12,500; so
the accumulated losses in this branch alone exceed the
amount of the capital. It cost the Standard the whole
of the accumulated funds, plus the whole of the capital,
plus something besides to transfer those policies which
have been transferred, leavinsr no funds or capital what-
ever to represent those policies (if any) which have
not been transferred. Under ordinary circumstances
that would sound very much like insolvency. The
circumstances are, however, not quite ordinary. In the
first place, the creditors are the policy-holders who have
not transferred ; and the Colonial Mutual has undertaken
to accept these remnants on the same terms. Thus,
though the funds are not available to pay the surrender
value on all the policies, the Colonial Mutual will accept
the balance of the policies ; evidently it expects to get
square by saving some money on the administration of
those policies as the premiums come in. When a
policy is issued the premium has to do two things—pro-
vide for (1) the payment of the claim and (2) working
expenses. If working expenses have been calculated and
provided for at the rate of 12 per cent., and the work can
be done for 5 .per cent., clearly the office will make a
profit of 7 per cent. In this case, since no new business
is being sought, the expenses will be very low ; where-
fore, though a debit balance is shown on the transfer of
the business at present, it will probably be wiped out in
time. Heaven only knows what would have happened if
the Standard had kept on.
The position with regard to the Ordinary
branch may be better. At any rate, after paying out
claims and surrender values, £16,696 remained in hand
on June 30, though whether that was equal to the sur-
render value of the untransferred policies cannot be
ascertained. It was not, however, for the Ordinary busi-
ness but for the Industrial that the Colonial Mutual
made its purchase. It wanted a ready-made Industrial
organisation, and it was prepared to pay 15s. a share
(£9376) for it. Hut that may not be the whole cost,
because if there are not enough funds to pay the surren-
der values on the transferred policies it will have to make
them up. It is still a question whether it was worth pay-
ing so large a sum for an organisation which has pro-
duced such patently-poor results.

This is a frightfully tangled business. Originally the co.
was formed with a 10 per cent, cumulative preference on
the public issue of shares, good for seven years. The
capital necessary was under-estimated ; and the position
became even worse when the business grew rapidly
on account of the Sydney building boom. After a
couple of years, a heavy bank overdraft having
been accumulated, the directors got into the habit
of “deferring” the dividends. In the table it is shown
that no dividends were paid from September, ’OB, to
March, TO—three half-years. Then, however, the divi-
dends which had been declared 18 months earlier were
paid. At the end of the past half-year there were thus
four terms for which no div. had dropped into share-
holders’ pockets. Tilings having, it is said, improved
considerably, the directors propose now to pay off all the
arrears of pref. dividend. A div. of 7 per cent, per annum
is also declared on the ordinary shares ; but the amount,
covering four half-years, is not to be paid until things
improve still further. In the table, pending actual pay-
ment, the amount is shown as a reserve. The reserves
are made up this way :
For equalisation of dividend .. £3,250
Ordinary-share reserve .. .. 7,176
Plant and building reserve .. 10,780
Special reserve 7,360
Undivided profit 3,605
Deferred ordinary dividends .. 8,117
Total .. ... ..£40,288
It will be seen that there are three lots of dividend re-
serves. The equalisation of div. reserve may be drawn upon
for the benefit of pref. or ordinary shares. The ordinary
share reserve is a fund built up for the special benefit of
ordinary shareholders. The practice is to put to this
fund a percentage equal to the difference between the
rate of div. paid or deqlared on the two classes of shares.
Thus the prefs. get 10 per cent.; and if the ordinaries get 7
per cent., another 3 per cent, is passed to their reserve.
The third reserve consists of deferred divs., credited to
ordinary shares, and payable when the finances are easier.
The pref. shareholders now draw 4s. per share. Ordi-
naries have to their credit, in deferred divs., a shade under
3s. per share, apart from the special reserve.
As before mentioned, the co. began with too
little money, and soon got heavily in debt. The situation
was, however, relieved slightly by the issue of more
shares in 1907-8. The liabilities have been fairly steady
lately ; that is to say, the undivided profit has been about
equal to meeting the demands for business extension.
Total liabilities are shown hereunder :
Sept., 1906.. £11,042 Mar., 1909.. £89,701
Mar., 1907.. 31,415 Sept., 1909.. 50,801
Sept., 1907.. 39,84 S Mar., 1910.. 45,606
Mar., 1908.. 38,342 Sept., 1910.. 45,112
Sept., 1908.. 60,368
The general reserves (including the general equalisation
of div. account) amount to £17,635. Whether anything
has been written off to cover depreciation and wear and
tear it is impossible to say. No working account, or even
profit and loss account, is published ; and in the balance-
sheet all the assets are thrown into one tip. Plant and
machinery are depreciating; but there is no telling
whether the profits shown above have to provide for it,
or whether the provision is made independently. It
oughtn’t to be possible for a co. to issue accounts which
leave things in this murk, and escape an earnest inter-
view with the law ; and even if the law is an ass the
Stock Exchange should refuse its countenance to a con-
cern in which the insider has such an obvious advantage
over the outsider. But it looks as though in this matter
the Stock Exchange is an ass too.

This meat-freezing- and exporting is a pretty erratic
business. Either the live-stock market this end or the
dead-stock market the other end may upset calculations.
In Maoriland, the rainfall being more of a certainty
than it is in most parts of Australia, the supply
of live meat is less fluctuating. Nevertheless, even in
Maoriland it fluctuates considerably. Local requirements
keep about the same whether the season is good or bad ;
it is only the surplus chop that goes into foreign circula-
tion. The past season in Maoriland has been fairlysatis-
factory as regards the supply, and prices in the foreign
markets have been good. Hence, with the two things
simultaneously in the co.’s favor, the year’s results are
unusually fine. One trouble in connection with works
and investments of this kind is the tremendous deprecia-
tion. A struggling co., eager to give the share-
holders a decent rate of interest, frequently
drops into the habit of trusting to the future, hoping
that in some extra-good season it may be able to make an
extra-big “ punch,” and square the depreciation account.
If the extra-big punch is made, well and good ; if not, the
time usually comes when machinery, bought with capital,
has to be scrapped, and more capital has to be raised to
buy new machinery. Which then means that one lot of
capital has to struggle to earn two lots of interest, the
other lot of capital being really lost or paid away in
unearned dividends, and therefore unable to earn its own
interest. This, no doubt, applies more or less to every
manufacturing co. ; but it applies more than usual to
meat works because of the rapidity with which they rush
to ruin. It is the point on which the investor has most
need to satisfy himself.
This co. has written its assets clown vigorously.
True, it has not established a cash depreciation fund—a
liquid reserve from which it might draw to pay for re-
newals and replacements. But it has done the next best
thing: it has partly paid for many plant additions, etc.,
out of profits. This year it sees a chance to do something
even more strenuous than usual ; so, besides writing
£SOOO off works, it collars £10,972 further profit for use
in repairs and replacements, either in progress or author-
ised. In the table at the top of these remarks the total
amount is shown as written off. The £BOOO will, of
course, be also available to buy plant additions or other
assets. The past 10 years’ history may be shown this
way
Profits £168,884
Dividends 91,575
Left in the business .. £77,309
This spells prudent management. Ten years ago the
capital was £56,250, in ordinary shares; it is now
£183,727, of which £75,000 is represented bv pref. shares.
The business has, however, grown so' rapidly that this
increased capital is not enough to finance the
co. ; and, apart from drafts against shipments,
there are liabilities, mainly secured, slightly in exc£ks of
£BO,OOO. The management is to be congratulated on
taking so large a slice of the past year’s profits and put-
ting it into works, instead of borrowing more money for
the purpose and scattering the profit in dividends. The
co. is thus going the right way to get itself regarded as
an investment instead of a speculation, feasting to-day
and starving to-morrow.

That was to the end of September ; but there has been a
Is. dividend since then, and “the policy of the directors
is to declare dividends quarterly.” Each shilling div.
now calls for £25,000. On the figures of the past two
half-years, and in view of the fact that heavy depreci-
ation must be provided for, a dividend of that size
would, of course, be impossible. But, as a matter of
facts what has been done and what the co. hopes to do
amsvery different animals. The co.’s works at Broken
Hill are in three sections. . The first ran throughout the
last half-year, the second started up in August, and the
third after the half-year ended. There was, however, an
old mill, and that ran for about three months. Still, the
production is expected to be at least one-third more this
half-year than it was last; hence the profit should easily
pass £60,000. It takes £50,000 to pay two quarterly divs.
of Is. each ; so even if only £60,000 were realised, there
would be a fair, though probably not sufficient, mar-
gin to provide for refreshments and renewals, and to
allow for the occasional shutting down of a section. To
put the profit at £60,000 is, however, to put it very low.
It is pretty well known that the Sulphide Coporation is
making considerably over 12s. per ton out of its zinc-
treatment ; and the De Bavay Co., which ought to make
as much, will treat over 200,000 tons of material this
current six months. But, of course, the De Bavay Co.
will have to pay for the stuff it handles, while the Sul-
phide Corporation works on its own ores.
The co. can very well do with a margin of
£30,000 per half-year, for there are many contingencies in
this business. Costs (legal) will probably take more than
a trifle. Ever since zinc-flotation started, there has
been trouble over the patents. First, the unfortunate
Potter and the fortunate Broken Hill Prop, got to holts ;
then the Elmores and the Minerals Separation Co. ; now
the Minerals Separation Co. —the people who have been
running in double-harness with the Sulphide Corpora-
tion —have served this co. with a writ alleging
infringement of patents. Besides this risk ari.—
ing out of litigation, the spelter and lead markets
are not too firm foundations to build upon.
As to spelter, the “convention” has been renewed, and
the market may thus be supported for the next couple
of years ; but, in spite of all similar efforts, the metal has
dived to some dreadful depths in the past. It was dow n
as low as £l6 in 1901 and got a shade under £lB in 1908.
Knowing this, the co. has started to build up a dividend
equalisation reserve ; there is already £25,000 to the credit
of that fund. In estimating the profits for the past half-
year the metal for which final payments have not been
made has been valued at £22 ; and there should be a
fair margin there too, for the price has lately been hover-
ing around £24.
Further and finally, zinc-extraction isn’t a
business that can last for ever. The Broken Hill mines
have a bottom somewhere (it has already been found in
some places) ; and long before the end happens the accu-
mulated dumps will have been used up, and current pro-
duction will have to be relied upon. There may be turns
for the better as well as for the worse, no doubt. Lead
may, for instance, improve in price, and it is quite pos-
sible that better recoveries will be made as the staff gets to
know more about the business. Still, it isn’t safe to build
much on that; for the Broken Hill experience has been
that the deeper they have mined the sulphides, the more
treatment troubles they have found. And this has
counterbalanced most of the improvements in mill
practice.

The most modern, simple and effective "Vacuum
Slimes Table is the “ Wilfle.v.” It is continuous, and con-
sists of a revolving drum which is partly submerged in a
tank of slimes or material to be filtered. The drum is
covered with a filter cloth supported on grooves on the
drum, which are connected by means of holes to the
interior to allow the liquid to be withdrawn. Through
the trunnions at the ends of the drum the vacuum pipe
passes to the interior. This pipe connects with the
interior of the drum, through which the liquid and air
are withdrawn by means of a vacuum pump. The filtered
slime is removed by a simple apparatus placed at or
below the level of the pulp in the tank. So that direct ly
the cake is removed the surface of the filter cloth as it
revolves is immediately re-immersed in the pulp ready to
receive a fresh cake, thereby preventing the sucking in
of air, and consequent loss of vacuum between the time
the cake is removed and a fresh one is forming. The
residual liquid in the slime cake is removed by distribu-
ting water over the surface of the semi-dried cake. Owing
to the fact that the filter is circular in form, it will be-
seen lhat it is continuous in operation, and has no com-
plication of valves to get out of order ; furthermore,
work is being done continuously during the whole revolu-
tion of the"filter drum. The Austral Otis Engineering
Company, of South Melbourne, have the sole manufactu-

last year, has every hope of paying respectively 10 and
15 per cent, this year. A hint of the rise was given at
the annual meeting; and at the statutory half-yearly
meeting the other day the chairman said that tilings
were going the right way. But there appears to be a
pretty general feeling on the Board that the div. must
stop there until the reserves have been much strength-
ened. The pref. shares are held by the State; and the
Parliamentary Committee on Banking, which recently
reported to the Council, gave it as its opinion that, it
wouldn’t be a bad thing to buy the other shareholders
right out.

There is going to be a strenuous fight for three
seats on the Board of the Australian Bank of Commerce.
A very influential committee of the British shareholders
is combining with a Sydney group to get some new men in.
■A comparison of Stock Exchange prices at the
close of 191.0 wit h what they were one, two, three or four
years ago shows that, though the moneyed person talked
a lot beforehand, he isn’t prepared to give his securities
away with a pound of tea in spite of the arrival of Labor
parties and land taxes. Bank of Australasia shares,
which were worth £lOB at the end of 1008 and £ll3 15s.
at the end of 1000, have moved on up to £ll7. The Com-
mercial of Svdnev quotations (same years) have been £37
155., £3l 10s'., CS3 108. Every fire-insurance slock quoted
lias had a siinsCaiitial advance. Gas shares have in some
cases fallen in the 12 months, but are mostly higher than
they were two years ago; Probably because of a vague
doubt as to whether the co. will he able to keep its
monopoly, Colonial Sugars are lower-priced ; still they
nave had a w itering. With hardly an exception other
“ industrials” have appreciated. In fact, the only group
in which there has been a pretty general fall has been
coal; and a blind man could have felt that coming. You
can’t choke off an export trade for four or five months
without losings a good deal of it altogether.

The N.S. W. Labor party made an effort to help
Private Enterprise the other day ; but the Leg. Council
jumped heavily on the good intentions. Some time ago
the people-—mostly J. Bull—who own the Nymagee
(N.S. W.) copper mine, undertook l o guarantee interest
on the proposed Hermidale-Nymagee railway for a few
years if the Stite would build it. The Government
agreed on condition that Parliament sanctioned the work ;
hut the Leg. Council shut down on the proposal, chiefly
on the ground, it seems, that the Nymagee is an aban-
doned mine. That the mine isn’t worked simply because
ir, hasn’t got a railway didn’t seem to occur to the elderly
gentlemen, who, on the same principle, wouldn’t appa-
rently dream "t throwing a lifebuoy to anybody who
couldn’t keep afloat without it.

Chairman Arthur Robinson told the Zinc Cor-
poration shareholders last week that, for the 11 months
to the end of November, the co.’s profit might be put at
t;112,000. This was on an output of approximately
245,000 tons, so the.profit works out at just about 9s. per
i on. It is very magnificent, especially considering that,
until three or four years ago, the stuff was unprofitable
ladings. The one fly in the spikenard is that, when the
accumulated dumps are used up, production and profits
will both tail off.

Some Broken Hill share quotations at the end
i.f the last,sl,ump year, at the end of the last boom year,
a id,at the recent close of the market: —
1902. 1906. 1910.

South .. .. 20/- 151/- 104/-

It is a rackeoty market because profit depends so much
on the other rackptty market for lead. That the North
and South have kept their prices so well compared with
the 1906 boom quotations is due to (1) the fine develop-
ments of tractable ore at the bottom levels, and (2) the
good contracts made for the sale of their zinc-tailings
output. As for the future of the lead market, anything
that anybody can say must be mere guesswork. It looks
as though it will take a new wave of commercial activity
to carry prices much farther than they are at present;
and those waves don’t run according to any known
timetable.

At Wyalong (N.S.W.) this year’s output will
show a slight falling-off when compared with the previous
year’s, which was 16,0000 z. gold. The field’s most note-
worthy events of the year have been the sale of the
Golden Fleece, now known as the Keep It Dark, and the
reconstruction of the Homeward Bound and Barrier cos.
Several new finds were reported, but all turned out
duffers. The Neelds put in another year’s vain work in
prospecting for the rich shoot of stone worked down to
the 400 ft. The field’s most profitable business has pro-
bably been the re-eyaniding of tailings and slimes.

“ Ben T.” : Re the wind-jammer Margretlia and
her “ shameful ” cargo of coke (B. 24/11/’10). With 4s. a
ton duty, it is uu to Australian coke ovens to be honest,
and turn out a better article. English and German cokes
contain from 8 per cent, to 10 per cent, ash, while the
Australian article goes anything up to 15 percent. Now,
Newcastle (N.S.W.)coal carries only about 4 per cent, ash,
and should yield a coke inferior to none ; so only Messrs.
Slack and Sweepings can explain where the coke ash
comes from. Mount Lvell is a business proposition, and
high-ash coke means extra cost in several ways—(l)
More coke used, (2) more fluxes to flux ash, (3) decrease
in capacity of furnace, i.e., smaller tonnage smelted, and
(4) bigger tonnage of slag to handle. I don’t say Aus-
tralia can’t make coke. It can! But it's up to Fisher
or someone to see that P. Enterprise,'Ltd., does it. An
excise duty on coke containing over 12 per cent, ash
would fill the hill. Or perhaps McGowen will put up an
oven or two on his State mine just to set a standard.

D. L. Doolette, of the Bullfinch, leaves for
London early in January, and his work will fall to
Boulder Hamilton and Fred Morgan, of the Bull Ant,
with Jim Harris still as manager. They are sinking two
shafts on the hitherto half-neglected No. 1 lease, where
the rise behind the camp seems to be mostly ore.
Further, No. 4 shaft, which was in Bdwt. ore doivn to
53ft. is "now in 6oz. ore, having carried that value from
53ft!'to the present bottom—something under 70ft. At
100 ft. the drive from No. 1 is advancing to No. 2
shaft in 7Joz. ore. From the water shaft, which
carried 25dvvt. ore down to nearly 100 ft., a drive
is going south at 100 ft. in 2£oz. ore; and
1700 ft. away values have been got on the boundary,
where a new' shaft is to go down. A main shaft is to he
started near No. 4, and will be rushed to 200 ft. as
soon as possible. Meantime things are hung up by a
strike, which shouldn’t have taken place. “ I’m in a
union," too,” Doolette said to the men, “and I’m obey-
ing the law. The Court is here to fix the wages—not I.
We are paying the highest award on ihe Yilgarn field. I
don’t say that vou shouldn’t get the increase ; hut go
hack to work, state a case for the Court, and ask for an
awird and if the Court awards an increase, we’ll pay it
as from this date.” It was a fair offer, and shouldn’t
have been refused unless the men had very good evidence
chat there was some trickery about it.

After a crushing of soz. to the ton from Tier-
ney’s claim at Ora Banda (W.A.), and the dollying of
equal values from a patch of saltbush loam about five
miles away, Kalgoorlie speculators went the whole hog
and pesrged for miles around. This, of course, was
in anticipation of a rush of buyers—a rush which is
unlikely to eventuate unless something is soon found by
the Bullfinch companies working outside the original
J>oolette ranch. The strata and ore occurrences at Ora
Banda are, nevertheless, far more regular than at Bull-
finch, and, given water (already promised by the Minis-
ter), the name should stand on the maps for some time to
come. The query of the moment is whether the values
will live into the sulphides, which so far have not been
good enough to warrant the establishment of a large
plant, or the promotion of heavily-capitalised companies.
* * * *
Golden Horseshoe (W.A.) will not pay many
more dividends under present conditions. The last
month’s return shows an average of 255. (id. per ton, or
Bs. 6d. less than the values said to be possible by engineer
Kuss in his late report. For November the co. made a
loss, and blamed it on to a two days’ strike of truckers
and the connecting-up of turbines, despite the fact that
the clean-up did not take place till well into December.
The management has been hard put to it to keep up re-
turns during the year, and a miracle is necessary to meet
tlie demand of the new plant for 80,000 tons a month, or
over 10,000 tons more than was turned out in November.
Numerous cables have been sent to J. Bull about the
Treasure lode, but the best values so far are Bdwt., and
the ore shoots are short.
* * * *
The new management of Oroya-Link (W.A.)
has not succeeded in putting more gold in the ore, and
the results, so far, have been a wearisome confirmation of
the late manager’s ad vice that the mill should be partly
closed down and a solid 12 months’ development policy
undertaken. The present real loss amounts to about
£lOOO a month ; but as the ore about pays for mining
and treatment and office expenses, the struggle to get
ahead of the mill will be maintained. On present out-
look shareholders will have to ante-up the sixpence they
recently received as a dividend, to provide a remodelled
plant and some development work.
**-■**
Boulder No. 1 (W.A.), one of the mysteries of
the Golden Mile, has come into prominence with the aid
of triliutors, who have found a shoot at 230 ft. worth 85s.
a ton. However, as previous finds have been short, this
discovery only attracts passing notice. Shareholders are
lucky in one respect.—the lease is being prospected by
other people. The tributors are on the cent re lode. The
South Kalgurli and JHainault have proved the western
lodes to run into the No. 1, while the Boulder has a shaft
1800 ft. deep, proving that the rich Ivanhoe-Boulder lode
runs northwards. Despite this, and the possession of the
St. George mill and the mine (the lease is block-on to
five Golden Mile producers), the whole thing is valued at
less than £25,000. A local syndicate would buy it at the
price and leave the Murchison property out; but direc-
tors won’t listen to such advances.
Great Boulder (W.A.)shareholders may or may
not have a happv new year. The drill is probing the
2Sooft. level on the line of lode, and on results depend
quite a lot of things. In one shaft graphite is still in
evidence. In the other a new quartzite body came
across the sink recently and'caused a flutter, but values
were absent. The drill and the pick will tell the tale
before 1911 is very old.
* * * *
Golden Ridge (W.A.) directors will now cut
down capital and reserve appropriations, and, with
£3OOO a month profit, promise 6s. a year for at least two
to three years ahead. Latest developments at the 500 ft.
have encouraged some pegging in the vicinity of the
mine, and two Kalgoorlie syndicates are determined to
prove whether the E.idge is a lonely deposit. So far
nothing worth mention has been found outside ttie
co.’s boundaries.
* * * *
Gw.alia South, Leonora (W.A.), provides a
puzzle for shareholders. Directors remain optimistic,
yet shares drop from 30s. to 7s. 6d., and the Board pro-
fesses utter inability to give a reason. A poor return,
with profit £lOOO less than it was, sent quotes down
lately with a run ; but there is the usual cheery announce-
ment that things are all right at the mine. Want of
water and a poorness of stopes account for the falling off
this month ; but, apart from that, shareholders are be-
coming restive at the discrepancy between mine reports
and actual results. From all accounts the latter should be
decidedly b"t,ter than they are.
Associated (W.A.) stumbles along and is mak-
ing the connection with the new plant an excuse for
shutting down temporarily 7 . Some encouragement has
been given lately by an improvement in stope values, and
hopes are expressed of something or other better happen-
ing next year. Until the London directors become
frightened about their fees and take a grip of affairs,
local hopes will not burn
Nelson and King, two prospectors for the Nor-
thern Territory Mines and Exploration Co., furnish a
silver-lead Christmas box to an expectant Queen-street
(Melb.) crowd. Failing in one quest, they hied them to
the Maearthur River in the Northern Territory. There,
somewhere near Borroloola, they picked up a lode, and
the yarn they tell about it makes the mouth water.
Barney’s Creek cuts through the property, and seems to
have done all the preliminary prospecting ; it shows a lode,
“ when exposed,” 50ft. wide; while in the distance, on
the same line, is what appears to be “ a hill of galena.
So out pesrs and at ’em, till four 80-acre leases are taken .
These leases are called Armstrong’s. Most men would have
been satisfied with thisshareof good things from Pandora s
box. Not so Nelson and King. Eigtit miles to the south-
east they spied “an immense outcrop of silver-lead,
showing for over a mile, many feet high, running north-
west and south-east, and in no place less than 100 feet
wide.” This is “iron-gossan-manganese and silver
matter.” Here, too, a kindly creek has cut through the
lode and exposed “ 100 ft. of splendid-looking carbonate
ore.” This all reads beautifully ; but somehow
Borroloola has a familiar and not very pleasant sound.
So the question may be put whether tiiese lodes are
new discoveries or whether they have been napped
before. What is wanted, also, is some information as to
whether the prospectors are men acquainted with silver-
lead deposits and skilled in field work. The public is
hanging off for news of this kind. Until it gets some,
and is fortified bv independent testimony, it isn t likely
to do a Bullfinch flit to Borroloola. or even get excited
over what others say they have seen there. *
Cathcart, Ararat (Vic.), collided with the gentle
investor when the word was sent round that no Christmas
box was to be dispensed. Knowing the love of the average
Victorian director for divs., the immediate surmise seemed
to be that the pot was on at last. The Argus got the
blues, and hinted that Donovan’s bores were a frost, that
there was no gold east in the Cathcart, and no hope west.
The market was not, however, very keen to take alarm ;
in fact, some folk started in to buy. Nevertheless, the
position reallv is bad, and it shows that there was more
vaporing at the last half-yearly meeting. The reef-drive
east is feet below where Donovan’s bore indicated the
bottom. No good wash has been developed for weeks past,
and supplies available must be running very short. Present
depth of the gutter means another shaft. Does the
length of lead in the claim or do the prospects in general
iustifv the expense? Whispers are afloat that the
scheme to amalgamate with the Cathcart Central is being
revived. Worse things could happen. But what a
come-down for the confident crowd that consistently
pitched the 3’arn that the lead would have to run up-hill
to get into that much-abused corner claim !
Langford has got his Balfour-Stanley railway
Bill through the Tasmanian Parliament., and he now
struts round as if he had the tight little island in his
grasp. There is as much button-holing and whispering
over the concession as there used to be over Briseis and
the old Maori Queen. The passing of the Bill was cele-
brated in regal style with a dinner to the Flyspeck’s
Parliamentarians. The world has also learned that
Henry Jones and the radiant Peacock and the rest of the
jam people are uniting with other Hobart, capitalists to
have a cut in at the Mount Balfour Copper Mines,
plus the tramway. Seeing that they get £lO
scrip for £2, or for £2 10s. or £3 if they exercise their
options, and seeing the tonnage of copper alleged
to exist, in Langford's mine, they cannot be said to fare
badly in their deal —provided there is no hitch in any
one’s plans. The Jones-Peacock-Hobart syndicate is to
undertake further financial assistance, “ both here and
elsewhere,” in the promotion of a new eo., which is to
find the necessary money to construct the tram- and
equip the mines. Besides this group, the “co-operation
of influential British investors” has been enlisted. But
the doubting- world wants to know just what loading the
Hobart group and the “ influential British investors ” will
insist on. It wants to know also the prospects of the
mine. It doesn’t want to he told this in frothy language,
but prefers advice from a cold-blooded expert taken from
the camp of the people who are to put up the cash.

Williams’s Fancy, Berringa (yic.), shuffled
along with 2Jjdwt. stone for a long time. Now the
manager is so elated over his 3Jdwt. dirt that he sets to
work making profits and wiping down the overdraft.
This is the most natural thing to do at Berringa, for
4dwt. dirt, no matter the depth, has always meant a bit
put by for a rainy day. Better prospects have been got
on the Revival lode out east, and so crosscuts are being
rushed out at four levels to test the shoot there. John
Bull had the chance to cut into this claim, but he could
not.see cash in it. Nor would anyone else except a mine
manager who car. make profits on 14s. dirt.

As the paid capital is only £9625, the past half-year’s pro-
fit was at the rate of 120 per cent, per annum. The total
area worked in the six monihs was 16 acres —which is
more than usual —and the total area left is 203 acres.
The ground varies; but there is no visible reason why

The outsider who dabbles in Mount Morgans is
iable to get some shocks. Among all metal-miningshares
n Australia, Morgans are the nearest approach to an in-
vestment, as distinguished from a speculation ; yet it
takes very little to knock them down shillings, and
whittle half a million off the market value of the con-
cern. In fact, a while ago they fell bflow 40s. (They
are now something over 705.) The fact is most of
the shares are held by rich men like Walter Hall,
who don’t care tuppence what the shares are
quoted at. The big men in most other mining concerns
are expected to “ support the market ” when their stock
starts to take a dive, and they generally do. But if the
public likes to gamble in Morgans the Morganaires look
on with contempt and let the gamblers do their best or
worst.

The Parliamentary committee which has been
investigating the Zeehan smelters and the stoppage
thereof, has done what was expected—it succeeded
in finding out a number of things that everybody knew
already, viz. :
(1) That the smelters have been for years, and are now,
losing money.
(•>) That more money was lost when the co. was young
than has been lost recently ; partly because it had more
to lose, and partly because it didn’t know too much about
refractory ores in its youth. (It doesn’t know too much
about them now ; but that is a detail.)
(3) That the State’s loan of £20,000 has failed to keep
the co. going, and the money has all gone.
(4) That the co. might be able to show a profit if the
Hercules ore, which now is sent out of the State, could
be secured at a returning charge of 475. 6d. instead of
the 455. per ton offered by the Hercules co.
(5) That the operations of the privately-owned Emu
Bay railway encourage this disastrous export of ore, and
handicap the,smelters and the State railways.
The committee took it upon itself to do a bit of
“mediating” between the Smelting Co. and the mine-
owners, with the result that neither would give way :
both sides sat back and waited to see how much the
kindly committee could squeeze out of the Government
for them. It panned out at a total rebate on railway
freights, on ore carried from the Hercules and Primrose
mines to Zeehan, of £4750. This brought the parties
within £1250 of each other, on an ore-supply contract
worth at least £lBO,OOO. It didn’t seem much to quarrel
about, but on the proposal being submitted to the Smelt-
ing Co.’s manager, “the committee heard with great
disappointment that he could not recommend his co.
to accept it.” Thus ended the “mediation." But
the committee is so pathetically anxious to
induce these conflicting Private Enterprisers to
bury the hatchet (at the State’s expense), that it con-
cludes its report by recommending the Government to
make an offer of further freight and other concessions to
the smelters. And the Government, being a shilly-shally
Government, married to Private Enterprise, will probably
offer those further concessions,- Instead of foreclosing on
its £20,000 mortgage with a snap, re-starting the smelters
as a State concern, withdrawing the concessions it now
,rjves to the Hercules co., and entering into competition
with the Emu Bav Railway Company. Nothing short of
these plain, common-sense business methods will save
the silver-fields of the island from disaster. Meanwhile,
the miners of Zeehan are clearing out of the State by
shiploads—chased from their homes by a swarm of State-
subsidised parasites.

There is some prospect of the manufacture of
paint and varnish oils from the kauri peat swamps of
northern Maoriland. Oils and illuminating gas have on
a small scale, been made from the peat, and the Standard
Oil people had a smell at the stuff years ago. The local
syndicate opened its mouth, however, and the Standard
people didn’t like the amount asked, so the deal was off.
German chemists are now investigating, and it is hoped a
practical working scheme will result. There is plenty of
raw material.

A Western mill buys ore on assay value, or
rather pais for it on mill sample if preferred. Recently
a parcel was treated, and samples were put in kitty
every quarter of an hour according to regulation. Kitty
can onlv be opened in the presence of miner and miller,
so this was all right. In N. S. Wales the samples are
ass ived behind a glass window, through which the
owner can watch if he pleases. Here, m the West, the
owner was supposed to keep behind a bar. He did so,
but looked on to such purpose that the gold from the
mill at the end of the month cleaned up £7OO less than the
assays showed the mill should have recovered. A search
revealed the fact that the samples from one claim had got
a secondary enrichment, or it looked very much like it.
The story has a sequel, as the public, hearing of a good
crushing, jumped in to buy the shares, while the owners
of the claim got out. . <•

“C.L.G.”: Re remarks anent Central Sugar
Mills in Queensland (B. 8/1 U/’l0). Besides the profit
shown, large sums, especially at, the Prqserpine, have
been spent on improvements, and these have been
charged up with working expenses. In addition, and
most important of all, a complete revolution in the con-
ditions of labor has taken place. The State-controlled
mills pay the same wages for eight hours that the
“ cocky ’’-controlled and the C.S.R. mills.pay for 11 hours.
Moreover, the men at the State mills enjoy not only more
pay, but also better food, and proper conditions under
which to eat it. The dining arrangements at the C.S.K.
and the eocky-bossed central mills are, in fact, a disgrace
to Australia. And, again, at some of the. C.S.R. mills,
almost half the employees are Japs and Chows and Malays,
whilst at the central and Government mills it is all
white labor. The way the Government manages the
labor question at the .mills it controls is naturally re-
garded by the other central mills and tile C.S.R. as a
menace to their interests—which accounts for a lot
of the opposition to the State mills.

AN ABORIGINAL DESCRIPTION.
JA CKY (who wants to buy an accordion, but can't
think of the name): “Baal that pfeller!
That round square pfeller like it gin bottle.”
“Rooinek” (from S’Africa) :
The Boer is an absorbent race. . . . The speaker was
billed as Mr. Van Spijker. I thought, as his Dutch
flowed freely, that I caught something foreign in it.
Afterwards I supped with Van Spijker. Dropping Dutch,
I said in English : “ Were you born here—you’re not
Dutch, I take it ?” “Go aisy now,” said he. “Butyour
name?” I asked. “ Well,” he replied, “ wance I used to
spell it O’Neill, and now I spell it Van Spijker, and it’s
the same thing entirely.” Then the truth dawned on me,
and we mixed a chuckle with our beer. “ Van,” of course,
is “of” or “ O’,” and “ spijker ”is a nail—and the brogue
did the rest.
“ C.S.A.” : A recent case of leprosy near
Cairns (Q.) is attributed by some to the sufferer
eating wallaby’s liver. Leprosy has been attributed
to many things, including rice, fish and Labor
legislation ; all the same, there may be something
in the wallaby theory, as cats, fed on the raw flesh
of the beast, contract sores around the mouth and
throat, and dogs fed exclusively on the diet lose
flesh. Wallaby and most other marsupials are
the chief source of hydatids (I go nap on this
assertion). The flesh-worm, which infests the
wallaby in the tropics, apparently gains ingress at
the heel and develops, sometimes to Sin. in length,
between the sinew and bone of the leg. When
developed this worm throws off spawn, which
eventually encompass the whole internal economy
of the animal. I have noticed worms in the wal-
labies in the drier regions, but whether they are
the same brand I can’t say.
“Lang”: Re that “useless” squirrel
commented upon by “ Yalgun ” (B. 1/12/TO) in
his discourse on ’possums. “Useless!” Great
gums ! Why, the squirrel’s fur, either the brown
or the piebald, is superb ; and his pelt, even when
bush-cured, builds the most beautiful and lasting
rugs, muffs, boas, etc., of any bird, beast or rep-
tile ; and this “Yalgun” would know were he a
genuine huntsman. Of course, the squirrel is not
nearly so plentiful as his cousin the ’possum, nor
is he so easily taken on account of his flying
customs; but, once he is captured—well, he’s a
prize. Moreover, squirrel farming is out of the
question for the same reason. And what nicely
judged flies he flies ! Have never yet known one
to make a mis-cue when aiming for the lower part
of one tree-butt from the summit of another. But,
then, I should say, even if he did miscalculate Jiis
distance, his flaps would aeroplane him gently to
mother earth without mishap.
“L.H.”: “ Les ” says the white hawk is
the most numerous of the five goshawks. It is
not. He then goes on to talk about the blue
hawk—“ the most numerous of the falcons.” The
only hawk that could possibly be called blue is
the grey goshawk, which is not a falcon at all.
Then “Montalex” speaks up, and finds that the
white hawks are albino falcons of different species.
It is possible, but not at all likely. The Mel-
bourne Museum authorities, slung at our heads as
absolute and final proof, are not particularly con-
vincing, as there is no ornithologist attached to
the museum. “Montalex” incidentally de-
scribes the grey falcon as an Australian analogue
of the peregrine—a description that is much
better applicable to the black-cheeked falcon.
Now for some plain facts. There are three gos-
hawks—the barred, the white and the grey,
though old John Gould may have been right in
thinking that the grey was only the immature
form of the white. In the extreme North,
smaller forms—the lesser goshawk, and lesser
white goshawk—partly replace the larger birds.
The barred and grey birds are common over most
parts of the continent. The white, though found
everywhere, is more plentiful in the extreme
North and in Tasmania.
* * * *
“Montalex”: To “W. K. Jones” (B.
1/12/TO). Let me straighten out this weary old
Burnett-salmon-cemtodMS-barramundi tangle. The
Australian lung-fish ( Ceratodus forsteri) has not
the remotest affinity with the salmon family, with
which “ W.K. J.” says it is “scientifically
classed,” though it is frequently called the
Burnett River salmon. It is also miscalled the
barramundi, a term which properly belongs to
another Queensland fish (Scleropages leichhardti)
of the Osteoglossid family, to which belongs also the
hugest of fresh-water fishes, the-arapaima of Brazil,
weighing sometimes 4001 b. The lung-fishes, of
which there are only two species besides the Aus-
tralian representative, represent the form through
which, countless ages ago, the fish ascended into
the amphibian. By some freak of Nature, Lepido-
siren in South America ,Protopterus in Africa, and
Ceratodus in Australia never got past the “ link ”
stagey They look to us now just what Alfie
Deakin will look 100 years hence to the Australian
historian who reads his manifesto addressed to
the Commonwealth, imploring it to be sure and
stand still.

“ Oscar G ” tells his yarn :
‘•We was standin’ in Princes Street, Dunedin (M.L.),
one Sat’d’y night, and up breasts a Salvation lassie—nice
lookin’ she was—and she ’olds out the tambourine to me
and smiled. I smiled back, and dropped in a sprat, and
big Scotty followed me good example and ante-d up a bob,
asking for saxpence change. The Salvy girl put the bob
in the plate and giv ’im a sprat back.
“Just then I remembered I ’ad ’arf-a-quid in me
pocket, an’ I looks to see if I ’adn’t giv it to the tart. Too
true, I ’ad. So I told the lassie, and she looked through
the tambourine an’ couldn’t find it. She said, ‘lt would
be here, if you really gave it to me.’ Then it hit me hard
that Scotty had got my harf-quid as change for ’is bob. I
got to that Scotchman lively. He said he’d got no money
of mine, and he showed me ’is purse—a shillin’, a tray bit,
an’ harf a quid.
“ Course, I knew the harf-quid was mine, but ’e swore
’e brought it out wiv ’im, an’ it wasn’t mine; and we
argued the point, an’ fit im, an’ he ’it me, an’ wegripped
an’ fell, and we mopped up the gutter with our clothes.
Tork about a go ; it took the whole Army to separate us.
I done in a new suit, an’ got a black eye, to say nothin’ of
nearly losin’ me job.
“ But I got me harf-quid. I’d left it at ’ome.”
* * * *
“ Giddap ” : A month or two back I had
an engagement as plough-chauffeur for a cockatoo
farmer. One morning the "missus” went into
the township. As usual, she forgot something,
and the boss ordered me to get the saddle on
Doughnut and go in pursuit. A few miles along
the track the road forked, and when I arrived
there I halted and did a think. One branch was
a mile longer, but a good road. T’other had a
rather nasty hill. Which would she take? I
was about to chance the right-hand track when I
noticed a gig coming my way. I waited. The
gig contained two girls, one evidently city bred,
the other the country cousin. I inquired if they
had passed a lady driving a buggy. They had.
It was the town-mouse who answered, and she
described the lady as “wearing, a heliotrope
blouse trimmed with cerise and turquoise blue,
and a large hat with glass hatpins.” Then the
bush damsel took up the running: “Was she
driving a chestnut with a white stocking on
the near foreleg ? ” That was the information I
required ; so I thanked them, and let my Arab
have his head.
A PREDICAMENT.
BOOKING CLERK (at Outback station): " You'll
have to change before you get to Sydney, of
course.”
NATIVE: “ Lor' blimel I've on'y brought one
suit.”
“Rastus”: “Psyche” (B. 24/11/10) is
quite correct, and the dictionary quite wrong, in
the matter of the Maori word “ pa.” There is no
Maori word, nor was there ever one, ending in a
consonant, and I doubt if there ever will be one.
Very often nowadays the Maori has acquired the
pakeha habit of contraction. Take the word
“awaku” (“I don’t know”). That got, by a
process of time, to “ awa ”; now it is simply
“aw.” This latter, of course, ends in a conso-
nant; but it is a contraction and not a complete
word like “pa.” I am sorry to upset the old
book, but I can’t let “pah” go without saving
something to the effect that both it and the Robert
brethren are wrong.

“ Bark Holden ” : When Binghi, jun., is
dragged to a mission station, the first thing
the authorities do is to undermine his con-
stitution by soaking the grime off him ; then they
feed him on “ white pfellers”' tucker, and lecture
him on the vileness of eating all things which
creep and crawl. If he were given even one meal
a day of snake and gohanna, topped off with
wood grubs and a handful of charcoal, there would
be some sense in it. The R.C. mission, near
Geraldton (W.A.), years ago found wisdom, and
instituted what are called “gohanna days,”
which, in black brother’s mind, are equivalent to
our Empire Day or Wattle Day. On these occa-
sions the mission blacks are pushed out into the
mulga for a week to make their bread from seeds
and bulbs, and slay their meat amongst the grubs
and beetles and other animals. Even with this
precaution black brother continues to grow less in
the land ; but he doesn’t grow less with such
velocity.
“ Vigilans,” from the graveside :
I shall never forget a native burial Iwitnessed in North-
West Australia. The grave was a square hole 3ft. deep.
Into this hole the naked corpse was placed face down,
wards. Hundreds of niggers, male and female, got into
this opening in turn, crying and howling dreadfully, and
throwing handfuls of dirt over their perspiring bodies.
The wailing of the gins around the grave oould be heard
a mile away. Both men and women threw themselves on
the ground at full length, and lacerated their flesh
with sharp stones or shells. Blood streamed from
the wounds. They worked themselves into a
frenzy, until exhaustion prostrated them. I wit-
nessed another funeral in the Northern Territory,
near Powell’s Creek. Here the grave was made in the
fork of a tree, and the corpse covered in with sticks, so
that no animals or birds could reach it. When the
cadaver begins to melt, the niggers stand underneath,
and allow the dripping fat to fall on their bodies. This
they rub well in, and then roll in wood ashes. They say
it makes them strong fellows. And so it does—in a way.
“ Chloe ” : “ Climax ” (B. 24/11/’10) asks
about egg-hatching by emus. The hen, I believe,
sits during the day, or, rather, part of the day,
while the male bird relieves her for part of the
night. A black brother first told me this yarn,
and I’ve been able to confirm it to some extent.
At noon or thereabouts the nest is abandoned,
and for some hours the sun is allowed to take a
shift. The young emus are independent little
beggars, and stay only a very short time under
parental control. That the birds take turn at
“ setting ” is the more likely, seeing that ostriches
divide their responsibilities in this way. The
grey female birds “set” during the day, while
the* darker male bird does his turn at night—
another instance of how the instinct of birds leads
them to make the best use of their protective
coloring. The natives of the De Grey station, in
the Far Nor’-West, had quite a colony of pet emus,
so their information should be fairly accurate ; and
it was there the writer obtained her news.
“ Bilbax ” : Glad to
find “ Abo.” writers
dispelling the silly
belief that Australia
has no song birds.
This was one of the
earliest of the
“ Stinking Fish”
libels on Australia.
Its imbecile inventor
originated it just
about 100 years ago,
and its adoption (for
epigrammatic use)
by Sidney Smith
gave it the wide cir-
culation that has
secured its accept-
ance to the present
day. There are
scores of Australian
song birds yet to be
noted. Here —back of
Gladstone (Q.)—there is
a woodpecker that, in
mating season, sings the
tenderest and daintiest
of love songs; and a
robin that is almost as
fine a performer. In
the mangroves on the
river bank (I’ve never
heard it elsewhere) is a
small bird that will sus-
tain for half an hour
without break the sweetest
of melodies, but with a note
of sadness predominant
throughout. “Moon’s” glad-
some thrush is here too, but is
rivalled by a slightly-larger
bird (a fruit-eater), with notes
as sweet and varied and with
a more powerful throat. To-
wards dusk, and especially after
a hot day, the joy-bird ripples
a laughing song that a girl-angel
might envy. And, leaving the
real songsters, there are the forky-tails that
twang a banjo delightfully ; and the dollar-
birds whose funny antics give point to their
incessant chatter and laughter. And the bush-
concert has its comedians (though they take
themselves seriously), the leatherheads. Here
they go in families of five—father, mother and three
daughters. They arrive always in a state of
wildest excitement, the girls shrieking, mother
scolding and father using threatening language.
After the old man has inflicted personal chastise-
ment on the youngsters, they settle down to
reasonable discussion of a musical matter ; and,
presently, one of the daughters calls, in purest
Cockney tone, “ Naow papa ! ” And pa leads off
with his part of “ Moses in Egypt.” Mu follows
with an even more ridiculous squawking. The
daughters cut in all together, break down in the
first bar, and giggle like the sillies that they are.
This rouses the old man’s temper, and he chases
them to the next tree where the same perform-
ance is gone through again. Apparently the
leatherheads’ motto is, “If at first you don't suc-
ceed, try again,” and they certainly exemplify the
occasional foolishness of that hoary gag, for their
ambitious attempt never gets past its beginning.
* * * *
“L.H.”: An organised outrage on our
bush thrush is being conducted through the
“ Abo.” columns. I refer to the foisting of the
name “Australian mavis” on the unfortunate
bird. Emerson, I believe, gathered-the mistaken
appellation. In the name of all that is Austra-
lian, why ? It is bad enough to have to call our
bird “thrush,” though, anyway, thrush is a family
name and covers a multitude of feathers. But
mavis is poesy’s pet name fora single species, the
English song-thrush, which our bird is not, nor
is it even a relation. The bird is pure Australian,
and not an adulteration of something English.
If “thrush ” won’t suit, call it “ whistling dick,”
as they do in Tassv. But spare us “ Australian
mavis.”

“Nearly (hie) blin', are you (hie), poor devil!
Nerrer mind (hie), go an’ get speechless an'

“ Jimmie Pannikin ” : Please let some of
the suburban bushmen have a go at the question
of how to mislead the mosquito. I have tried
many plans, but the best way is to cover the face
with a sheet, after hanging one’s hat on one’s feet.
For hours the mosquitoes will buzz round the
hatted pedal extremities, leaving the other end of
the sleeper in peace. By the way, an Outbacker
once told me that the only way to dodge bugs in
neglected bedrooms was to sleep in a macintosh.
Perhaps that Outback expert, “A. Willie Cann,”
can throw a lurid light on these matters.

“Sheila” : A real white man, who was
Bishop of Papua once, happened to be in a
goldfields store when the boss was talking the
usual vigorous language, with trimmings, to a
dissatisfied digger. ” The bishop presently put in
a quiet word. “ Oh, well,” said the storekeeper,
“ perhaps you’re right; but we all drop into the
customs of the country—you will yourself before
you’ve been here long.” It wasn’t long after-
wards that the bishop landed at a mission sta-
tion, bringing with him the black “missus” of a
native teacher. The storekeeper was at the
landing, and watched his lordship and the comely
lady land. He eyed them both. “ There y’are—
what did I tell you !” chortled the sinner.

“W.C.M.”: Bill Outback doesn’t know
the trouble the Law sometimes takes to fine him
five bob. Holcombe, P.M., of Hay, was travel-
ling lately from Hillston to Mount Hope, across
the desolation of the One Eye Track (Far West
N.S.W.). Twenty miles from Mount Hope his
motor started to bog, but by dint of much dig-
ging, they reached within 12 miles of the mount,
when the motor sank right down. The driver was
for giving up and walking in ; but the P.M. went
on digging. Then they cut mallee saplings and
corduroyed the road across the bog, and they
worked the whole 12 miles in the same way, cor-
duroying bogs and gutters till they reached Mount
Hope late that night. The work was quite
strenuous enough to make even Foster Fraser
admit that sometimes Australians are not quite
such post-leaners as they seem to be.
“ Cousin J.” : The biggest Cornish pasty
I ever saw was eaten by the office boy at crib
time. He boasted proudly that he had a larger
one for dinner; but he consumed it in a secluded
corner, hidden from mortal eye by the day book.
The crib-time pasty weighed 21b., a letter weight
and three wire nails ; it was 14in. long, 6in. wide,
and 4in. high, and covered with armor plate.
Willyum job n
(that’s the
office boy) put
another cover-
ing on it in
lOmin. 55 2-5
sec.—a world’s
record. He was
very fond of
pasties, was
Willyumjohn.
They were the
milestones in
his life. He’d
had two a day
from babyhood
—a “ pretty
littleun ” for
crib and a big,
large one for
dinner. He
went “down
township”
every Satur-
day night, and
as a treat he
always bought
himself a
pasty. When
a young medi-
cal locum tenens
suggested that
so much pastry
was not good for
him, his mother grew
angry. “Let ’im alone, you,” she said; “boy
must eat.” Poor little chap! He caught
typhoid, and when he was just convalescent his
sister, Roseann, made him a pasty, without say-
ing a word to anyone ; and, oh ! how his eyes lit
up at sight of it. The Rev. Polsniffler prayed
long and earnestly. So did the Mothers’ Union
and the Young Ladies’ Bible Class. But it was
all UP with Willyumjohn ; for Cornish pasty is
impervious to prayer.

“C.V.E.”: I pearled for four years in
the Nor’-West, and the most reasonable thing
I’ve heard as to the cause of beri-beri was said by
Dr. Blick, Government resident medical man at
Broome:—
Beri-beri is caused by cramming a superabundance of
good food into skins unfitted by a former low rate of
living to receive it. The colored crews recruited from
Singapore are the principal sufferers. A few handfuls of
rice, an occasional fish, is mainly, and in some cases
wholly, the sum total of their menu. Here in Broome
they get meat, tinned fish, pickles, sauces, rice, bread,
fresh fish in any quantities ; and their weekly average of
10s. goes into the “slop chest ” mostly in exchange for
cake, tinned fruits, etc. Such an abnormal change from
semi-starvation is sufficient to kill, as it does in some
cases. On the other hand, it causes the partially-made
blood to rush from the stomach into the system, creating
a stoppage of the veins and swelling the legs in an
abnormal manner.

“Climax”: “J. 5.8.” (B. 10/11/’10) errs
when he says the horse-collar style of propelling
Matilda belongs to Queensland. Have been on
most of the back tracks in that State, and, with
two or three exceptions, have never seen Matilda
hoisted in the horse-collar position. She is gener-
ally swung by a strap, covered with a folded
sugee bag or old towel to keep it from cutting.
This connecting strap is slipped over one shoul-
der, which leave%(the lady in a diagonal position
on the The nosebag is carried
as stated by “J. 5.8.” When he says the horse-
collar position is the easiest, he’s wrong. It
isn't; and if he wants to prove it, let him choose
a hot day and a big plain and try it. Remember
once, when I was trying it, meeting an old
whaler between Adavale and Gumbardo (Q.).
When I struck him he was just pulling up for
dinner; and, after dropping Matilda, he lifted
three very juvenile puppies out of his billy, filled
it at the creek and proceeded to boil it. “ She
’ad /owr,” he said, “ but three’s all th’ billy ’ud
’old ! Stop and ’ave a drink o’ tea, mate.” I
said I’d had mine, and padded on.
“Alas”: One of the picturesque ruins
demolished by what Bruce Myth calls “the hob-
nailed boots of Labor” is J. Dennistoun Wood,
who was Solicitor-General of Victoria in the days
of the O’Shanassy regime, and of recent years a
Tas. M.H.A. Wood simply declined to stand out
of the way of the on-coming steam roller of demo-
cracy, and was crushed in his Tory tracks at the
last Tas. elections. As Tas. doesn’t possess a
Hansard there are no records in the House of the
many erudite speeches of Wood. But in the
Parliamentary Library is a book of his, called
“Poems in Rhyme and Verse.” Therein is a
lament for “ The Last of the Yarra Tribe,” who
is thus limned for posterity :
On the wild ducks he noiseless stole ;
His spear would pierce the water-mole
Just as it dived to gain its hole.
And when his boomerang he threw
He seldom missed the cockatoo,
As high above his head it flew.
Wherefore his simple love despise
That a black, naked maid could prize?
Are black less brilliant than blue eyes?
The strangers came ; old changed to new ;
To distant lakes the wild ducks flew ;
Away was scared the kangaroo.
The wrathful chieftain sought to slay
A white who stole his bride away,
But he was wounded in the fray,
For what availed the forest’s son
The victories his spear had won ?
He ne’er before had faced a gun.
There is surely something almost pathetic in the
fact that one of Australia’s really top-notch
political debaters should leave such a “ poem ”
behind him.
“ Blue Blazes ” : The argument that re-
cently rose in the North as to the extent of the
emu’s responsibility in the spread of prickly pear,
rushed breathlessly into the N.S.W. Assembly
the other day, and was introduced to the gather-
ing by the member for the Gwydir, with the re-
quest that the protection accorded to emus under
the Birds Protection Act, 1901, should be removed
in those parts of the State infested by the vege-
table porcupine. Donald Macdonell (Chief Secre-
tary) held out no hope of the Government agreeing
to the request, chiefly because there was nothing
to prove the bird’s guilt—this, of course, with
humility and the respect due to several Aboriginals.
The Australian Museum authorities, explained
the Chief Secretary, were not aware of it, “and
I am informed that the general opinion appears to
be that, although emus to a certain extent are
responsible for the spread of the prickly pear, they
are not more so than many other birds.” Then
the argument tore out into the lobbies and pulled
hon. members by the coat, and ran up into the
refreshment-room and put its oar into the hon.
beer, and at 2 a.m. next day it was still talking to
a legislator so that he lost his hon. train and had to
stay in town and pay 3s. 6d. for a room, and Is.
tip for the boots, and 2s. 6d. for breakfast, and Is.
for a telegram to his wife advising her there was
no need to bail him out this time. And finally,
when he got home after two days’ absence, his
wife accused him of “carrying on.” The next
emu that comes to this Parliament will be fined
20s.
THE HOLY HORSE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
If the ohurch work is to be done, the clergy must have
good horses, and not any old crooks. I’ve been compelled
to ride horses that had scarcely a leg to stand on. Rev.
J. Redmond, at the Anglican Synod, Ballarat.
The Ohurch has little progress had
On horses starved and tame.
How can it spread the tidings glad
With noddies old and lame ?
The parson’s nag goes flippy-flop
On bush tracks, deep and wide,
With half a walk and half a stop,
And fourteen stone of beef on top,
And not an oat inside !
The kind of horse the saints bestride
Is bumble-footed, blind
And strangled. He’s the knacker’s pride
When to the Zoo consigned ;
While Sin upon an Arab steed
Roars round his evil courses.
Is’t right the Devil in his greed
Should have the best tunes for his need,
And eke the swiftest horses?
How grim the thought! The Carbines fleet,
(Which in their youth and beauty,
Where “ books ” and punters gaily meet
All do the Devil’s duty)
When old and shouldered from the race
By some disease or other,
Devote their services and pace
To furthering the Church’s grace—
Like you and I, my brother.
VICTORIA.
EDDYSON.

Aboriginal: That gibe about the rivers having
no fish, the flowers no scent and the birds no song was
originally heaved (or hoven) at south Africa. Some fool
stole it and brought it to Australia. What place it
applied to before it was applied to South Africa this
paper can’t say. Probably Solomon said it re Ophir....
F. : Don’t know him. But if he was “ engaged writ-
ing poems for papers in Sydney,” he is most likely by this
time dead from starvation....W.R.J.M. : (1) According
to the last “ Commonwealth Year Book,” the production
(ex manufactures) of N.S.W. in 1908 was £46,678,000 and
of Vic. £28,169,000. (2) Yes.. ..A.W.A. : You’ve'guessed
wrong.. ..Bellerive: Glad to meet “The Tramp Detec-
tive ”:
In a country-inn room
A notorious scamp
Planned a diabolical deed
With a rough-looking Tramp ;
You brain him suggested
The cruel ruffian Bold,
And we’ll equally divide
The glittering gold ;
Despatch him he resumed
To-night in his sleep,
And we’ll hurl his body
Into the river deep ;
Overpowered and handcuffed
Was the fear and Dread,
And a pistol pointed
Towards his head ;
I arrest you exclaimed the truing
In the name of the King
I’m the bush Detective
And on the gallows you’ll swing.
Jack J.: Not a smile in the prose sketch. Verses fairly
poorstuff. .Brenda:Unsuitable...Eostran :Unsuitable...
H.R. (M.L.): Clumsy verse....E.C.: Underproof verse....
G. :We tried to sing your song, but just as we had
finished the first verse the German band and a barrel-
organ started in front, and the man at the poultry shop
at the back started to kill fowls F.J.D.: Three dis-
jointed and mournful poems. Don’t know what they are
about, and don’t care R.B. : Too slight.... Doc.:
Thanks for the wishes. We say nothing about the
verses L.L.G.: Too slight G.W.R.: You will not
reform the world by writing poems like “ O King.” The
one entitled “Whv?” is merely annoying in a small,
futile fashion. There seems to be an epidemic of these
irritating query poems lately. “How?” and “Why?”
arrived by the same post. We are looking out anxiously
with a shot-gun for “Whither?" and “What?”
T.C.0.8.: Just unfolded your murky poem entitled “?”!
The plum pudding is yours? R.S.W. : Exactly! It is
a tragedy of too many words... .J.P. (V.): A brief and
harmless jingle. Rejected with the compliments of the
season W.T.H. : Won’t take the responsibility of
urging you to continue. Returned Pip: Feeble verse.
M. 8.: Would make a good exhibit for a literary chamber
of horrors S. Septimus : Unentertaining drunk story..
M.C. (V.): “ The Little River ”is a limpid stream of verse,
but you have not dammed it skilfully.... The Beast: Un-
suitable .. J. A. P. : Scotch is all right so long as it is the sort
you can pour out and mix with soda. The rhyme is dry....
Agric. (N.S.W.): A love poem should never arrive with a
bouquet of compliments in its hand and a heavy curse in
its tail pocket, to be used in the event of the lady proving
unkind. Disqualified....L. Toff: We refuse to send
you anything to drink. We tried to buy you a bomb
disguised as a plum pudding ; but the ironmonger said
that, on account of the opening of the Grand Duke
season in Russia, he had been unable to get his orders
executed....J.P. (V.): The story evidently aims at
exposing the hollowness of life, but its axe is blunt or
something. An extract: “ The echoes of a man’s feet
resounded on the opposite side of the street as an indivi-
dual with his hands sunk deep into his trouser pockets,
shrugged shoulders and chin buried into his chest, sped
along the road muttering to himself, ‘ Bah 1 ah, bah !’ ”
No doubt, he was hoping that passers-by would mistake
him for a flock of sheep. It was an original disguise,
anyhow... Duellist: Shot both poems dead at 15 paces—
A.C. (S.A.): Have seen better nursery jingles....
P.J.W.: “Worship” reserved for a second reading.
Other fails... T. Leaves: Unsigned poem entitled
“How?” fell into the basket without pushing Gid-
yea : Don’t care for parodies ; it hasn’t sufficient force
anyhow Marcus: Crude, inconclusive story. You
owe the Religious Editor a bottle of rum for reading it.
E.H.R. : The revised “Dirge” is a fathom below
print level A.L. (Q.): Four lines of the elderly gentle-
man’s advice:
Let not such thoughts your manhood blast 1
Oh ! Peace will flood your soul at last,
When the storms of life are spent and past
And the wild waves wash no longer.
The last line suggests dimly an insolvent washtub-artist
contemplating retirement; also it reminds us of the
other sentimental poet who wrote :
When thou hast Love bier’d at thy gate.
The only possible illustration for that line would be a
stout, belltoppered person asleep in a rose-bush..
Mirielle : The MS. was carefully read and rejected —J.N.:
The poem is a botched one ; but we will extract four
lines:
His is the sordid, grasping life,
One search for fast made money
Oh ! after sixty years of strife
Sips he sweet milk and honey.
Did you ever hear a Fatman call for that absurd mixture
at the Australia? Reconstruct the poem by marrying
him to a rich widow called Rhoda, so that, in the next
line but one, he may sip his usual tonic—Scotch and soda.
...Drover: The lonely, mournful poem is overgrown
with scrub... R.W., A.L. (Q.), Dinkum, H.T. (M.L.): All
basketed Tea Gardens : Ditto with enthusiasm ...
C. A. Mann : Unsuitable.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC) CONTRIBUTORS.
H.N.T., Jacko, F.V.: No good D.R., Snooker, John
Murphy : You’ve sent to the wrong place. This isn’t the
Old-Age Pension office N.L.U. : The sort of pun for
which the basket gapes A.G.N.: Thanks, but can’t
make a picture of it.... Highfield : The beer-tap idea got
nearest to raising a ripple D.O’C.: The best is the one
we’d blush to print Fracteur :Go off 1
“ Vigilans” : In years to come, one of the
greatest industries in the Northern Territory will
be pig-raising. It is astonishing to see how well
the porker thrives and multiplies up there,
especially along the Katherine River, where herds
of him, rolling fat, live on yams, roots, fruits and
nuts. I venture to say that if the Federal
Government took the pig by the tail, in a manner
of speaking, the Territory would soon be noted
for its prime hams and bacon, and, instead of an
insignificant market amongst the Chinamen up
North, the world would be hammering on the
country for cured foods with the Commonwealth
stamp, and Chicago would be “ goldarned.”

A EOYAL APPOINTMENT.
Extract from Manchester (England) Courier,
21st October, 1910 Messrs J. Woodrow and
Sons, who have works at Stockport, with princi-
pal branches in London and Manchester, rank as
one of the oldest hat manufacturing firms in the
United Kingdom. They devote themselves to the
manufacture of hats of the highest grade, and have
an unrivalled reputation for style, finish and dura-
bility. At the Manchester Jubilee Exhibition of
1887 the firm exhibited the whole process of hat
manufacturing, and there were honored with a
Royal warrant appointment to the then Prince of
Wales. On the Prince’s accession to the throne in
1910 they were appointed hatters to H.M. King
Edward' VII. King George V. has just been
graciously pleased to renew the warrant of
‘ Hatters to the King ’ accorded to the firm by his
late august father.”*

The recent marriage of Victoria’s only
native-born baronet will, of course, tend to deepen
Australia’s profound respect for hereditary titles.
The Horderns are going to splash a few
tens of thousands in Perth. Thirty years ago the
late Anthony bought a block of ground in the
city. The family’s luck stuck to them ; the city
grew around that block, and now, having viewed
it and its surroundings, the firm’s architect has
produced plans for an arcade building which will
run into about £70,000.
George Fincham, of Richmond (Vic.),
Australia's premier organ-builder, had a funeral
last week. Samples of his work repose in many
churches, while his greatest effort—it cost £5560
lies mostly disused in the Melbourne Exhibition.
The old gentleman also cultivated bowls, which
may partly account for the fact that he escaped
the mowing-machine for 82 years.
Recent smashes in Victoria recall the days
of Richard Speight and his assistant, Allison
Smith. The latter contracted the habit of break-
ing up large quantities of old and rotten waggons
and carriages, and throwing them on the scrap-
heap. This was put forward as one of his most
heinous offences. Smith replied that some day
Victoria would be very sorry if it didn’t scrap its
old rolling-stock, and intimated that he was going
ahead with the job. Then Victoria told him he
didn’t know what he was doing and gave him the
sack.
DR. FINDLAY,
MAORI LAND’S
A TTORNEY-GENERAL.
“Melb” : L. L. Lewis, the grain-broker,
who left us for good last week, was married in
1863 to Rosa Dunn, eldest daughter of John
Dunn, comedian, whose younger daughter,
Marion, married Marcus Clarke. Miss Rosa
Dunn, at the time of her marriage, broke her
professional engagement with Barry Sullivan, at
the Theatre Royal, greatly to his chagrin; but
the marriage was a legal cancel. I presume that
is the law still. Sullivan replaced Rosa Dunn
with Rose Edouin, who also married a Lewis,
G.B.W. Mrs. L. L. Lewis had been a great pub-
lic favorite. She was a leading lady at about 14
years old—the original in Melbourne of the Colleen
Bawn. After many years’ absence she reappeared
with amateurs in about 1893, when her husband
organised what was called the Helping Hands, in
relief of the current distress. Lewis, who was
musical, was a former conductor of St. Matthew’s
church choir, Prahran. But I shall remember him
better for having introduced the Melbourne cab-
men’s shelters.
The N.S.W. Parliament last week voted
£lOO a year to E. W. O’Sullivan’s widow in recog-
nition of her husband’s services. There is only
one other such pension in existence in N. S.
Wales ; the late Henry Parkes’s family last year
drew £260, with something extra for house allow-
ance. There were several points of resemblance
between Parkes and O’Sullivan. They were men
of large ideas with regard to public finance,
and none at all with regard to private finance.
O’Sullivan was a Minister during the land scan-
dals, when thousands of pounds were waiting
ready to drop into the pocket of any man with a
pull if he would exercise his pull; but E. W.
O’Sullivan simply wouldn’t have been able to
understand that appeal even if it had been made
to him. A man might just as well have offered
him a stick of lolly as a thousand pounds.
AUSTRALIAN JACKS-A NEW VARIETY.
Peter Bowling, the talkative man with the
creaky tin halo—the one labor union officer in
N. S. Wales who wagged his tongue unceasingly
against the Labor party —has been pushed out of
the office of miners’ president at Newcastle.
Brennan and Lewis, who went to gaol along with
Peter, were put back in their old places as secre-
tary and treasurer ; but Peter denied his rightful
lord, the Labor party, and the cock crew as im-
mediately as it could.
Dead in London, at the age of 75, Mrs.
George Higinbotham, widow of Victoria’s bril-
liant Chief Justice, to whom she was married at
St. Kilda (Melb.) in 1854. Since her husband’s
death the lady has lived in London with her son-
in-law, Naval Reserve Commander Lyon, who is
one of the Waratah assessors. The couple raised
five Australians to adult age—George (who died
lately in Africa), Edward (now in Burmah), Mrs.
Morris (wife of the Professor), and Mrs. Reade
and Mrs. Lyon, of London.
“P.X.” : In a recent Bulletin sketch of
the Bullfinch gold rush the writer noted that Six-
and-eightpence had already hung out a shingle—•
“Charles Mann.” That and some recent Esti-
mates recall a Budget delivered in Adelaide by
the original Australian Charles Mann. Mann—
he was a lawyer too —had his speech written for
the press. At the end he scrawled “Fireworks,”
which was Mann’s way of reminding himself that
at this point he was to let himself go. But the
printer didn’t understand, so the Budget went
out to the world with the laconic wind-up “ Fire-
works ! ”
The best attempts of the Melbourne Gal-
lery students are once more collected for public
perusal. Among the brightest productions are
chalk drawings of some hands and a masculine
nude by the promising son of painter
McCubbin. These things show that
the youth is beginning to draw very
well. The still life, including a can-
vas by Miss Esther Patterson, is as
interesting as usual; but the smooth
work in the antique is suggestive of
an art that has been brilliantined.
There are some human portraits
among the heads that are drawn ; but
some muddv-colored grotesquesamong
the heads that are painted ought to
be mentioned to the Sludge Abate-
ment Board. The most prolific ex-
hibitor of the lot—Miss Honey—
provides a forceful contrast in her
sketch of a draped girl with a broom,
and her large hack view of a heavy-looking nude.
Of the two, the former, in spite of its drawing,
will be preferred by those who have a liking for
grace before meat.
Died in Melbourne last week, L. L. Lewis,
of the swarthy countenance and big moustache, a
leisured citizen whose small exertions were mostly
devoted to getting himself better known. Inciden-
tally he was a “ commercial broker ” ; and in the
art of getting thirty shillings’ worth of value for a
pound sterling he had no superiors. He was a
dilettante in music. His marriage with Rosa
Dunn (sister of Mrs. Marcus Clarke and daughter
of an old-time actor) gave him a literary and
theatrical connection, and helped him to the news-
paper paragraphs he craved for. When Amy
Castles had been “discovered” and pluckily ex-
ploited by Mrs. Doubleday, L. L. Lewis did much
to capture the young songstress; and with Father
Robinson and another cleric, he was appointed a
trustee for Amy in the first instance. Also,
he dedicated a song to her and burst forth as
a composer of other ditties. He and his wife had
no children, but they were addicted to pet dogs, of
which pampered animals the Bulletin has told
pathetic stories in the past.
The sing-song held by N.S.W.’s legisla-
tors to mark the close of a session that had not
been all harmony, recalls the fact that this par-
ticular State House holds enough stage talent to
stock a variety show'. Some of the most capable
artists didn’t perform last week. For instance,
H. D. Morton, the member for Hastings and
Macleay, is probably the best amateur conjurer
in Australia, and owns an apparatus almost as
elaborate as that of Chung Ling Soo. Holman
recites with intensity and the clear diction of an
actor. Andy Kelly is no mean balladist, and
Colonel Onslow’s piercing tenor never fails to
arouse interest. And there are many more. The
advent of Unification w'on’t necessarily mean the
ruin of N.S.W.’s professional politicians en bloc.
There are “shops” in half a dozen vaudeville
enterprises fairly gaping for some of them.
Died suddenly in Adelaide last week, of
the usual heart failure, William Storrie, one of
the bright men of South Aus. Adelaide
is sprinkled thick with literary societies,
which are something a good deal better
than smug debating unions, and Storrie —
a brother of Agnes, who has written some
good verse—was one of the stars in that
heaven. An old Adelaide firm of much
tonnage was W. and J. Storrie; but it
Eetered out, and this second-generation
torrie threw in with John Darling, and
was for years past the big wheat dealer’s
financial expert.
A. R. Angus, the man who has in-
vented the much-talked of electrical con-
trivance for preventing railway collisions,
is a Sydney solicitor who never worked on a
railway in his life. Most of his law work
has, however, been in connection with
patents. Alongside him works a brother, a
coachbuilder, and when one’s enthusiasm
flickers the other’s bursts out into a bigger
flame than ever. Already about £lO,OOO
lias been spent on the business, the money
having been put up by various Sydney
people to pay for options over shares in
a vast new co. which is to be formed when
the time for marketing the invention has
been reached.
“ W.8.M.” on Jim McGowen, as Premier
of N.S.W. :
No other member has been quite so happy and comfort-
able in this first session as Jim McGowen, who became
Premier with a jump without serving first as a minor
Minister. This feat was previously performed only by
Donaldson, Oowper, Parker and Forster. The other 13
Premiers, since Responsible Government, bad first been
Cabineteers. Still, Jim McGowen delights to mention
that he refused minor office several times; It must be
acknowledged that he shines brighter as Premier than
he did as Leader of the Opposition. He is calling the tune
now', not criticising it; and he is now looking after his
own department instead of switching his jumbled
intellect on to everything that cropped up. He has
time to lean back on the cushioned bench, with folded
arms and easy mind, while a Ministerial colleague is
worrying and tearing the mentally and physically
wracked Wade. He knows his own case well, and
he gets it off with the fluency of a phonograph. Wade
never took the trouble to study Laborism. He con-
temptuously ignored it. Now he finds the disadvantage
of ignorance, and has to flog himself dreadfully to say
something pugnacious and pertinent. He generally fails
conspicuously, and Premier McGowen smiles benignly
and occasionally comes to Wade’s rescue with such a be-
nevolence of voice and mien that the Opposition becomes
still wilder and more incoherent. Wade would prefer
almost anything to kindness, but Premier Jim is a big-
hearted chap, and therefore can’t oblige him. McGowen
was thus obviously hurt when Wade was gagged, and as
penance he would have given his opponent a whole night
to torture the Assembly with talk. The Labor Premier
is not only as easy-minded as a bush Boniface lounging on
his verandah in the cool,of the evening, smoking his pipe
and digesting his grog and grub ; he is as sweet-tempered
as a toddler with a toy in each hand and a lolly in his
mouth. Let it not be understood that he lacks dignity.
He has a sufficiency but not a superfluity of it. His
strength, however, i$ in his reserve, his self-restraint,
his capacity to shut up and remain seated under any
excitement. He is reposefuliy ;i conscious that he has
apt lieutenants. He doesn’t do any of the bullocking,
and he wastes no words. If he is not sciptillant, he is
certainly not insufferable, and he has mightily impressed
a majority of the Opposition, who are yearning for an
opportunity to raffle Wade, lend him to a suburban
council, or give him away to a temperance lodge.

“ Torres,” from Thursday Island :
“Thirsty” at present harbors a second Robinson
Crusoe—a Dane, commonly known as Harry. A bfeche-
de-mer fisherman in the early ’Bo’s, he and his mate (a
Frenchman) retired from the pursuit of this article de
luxe and settled on a speck of dirt in Torres Strait called
Deliverance Island. After an exile there of 20 years,
Harry was brought to “ Thursday ” a couple of months
ago by the Government steamer John Douglas. He
relates that when he settled on Deliverance Island the
place was overrun with rats. To rid himself of the pest
he started a cat farm, and, when he left, there was a herd
or drove of 200, mostly in a semi-wild condition. Early
in 1900, Harry’s mate left the island in the only boat the
community of two possessed, to seek a fresh speck of dirt,
and he never returned. Thus Harry was left to his cats
and his solitude, away from the tracks of steamers and
seldom visited by fishing boats. He reckons his island is
one of the healthiest in Torres Strait, and says that daring
his 20 years’ residence he did not have a day’s sickness.
At presept he is in splendid health, and is looking for-
ward to drawing an old-age pension when he reaches 65-
in October next.
C. B. Kellow, the Melbourne motor-car
importer who was handed a fine of £l9BO by Jus-
tice Higgins for juggling with his invoices, laid
the foundations of the affluence which will pro-
bably make payment easy, in a small shop in
Swanston-sireet during the bicycle boom of the
’9o’s. He was associated there with W. H.
Lewis, now of the Tarrant Motor Co. The public
knew and liked him as the big champion who fled
at pistol-shot from the vicinity of the scratch
mark in track events. His sensational ride in the
’96 Austral, whereby he raked in a cash prize of
£3OO, is remembered by most cyclists. Queens-
lander Boh Walne and he were the back-markers,
and Kellow, thenatthe topof his form, just flashed
into first place. It was probably the proudest
day of his crowded life. In business Kellow
was always the whirling sort of man the
average Yankee tries to be and generally thinks
he is. He never hung absurd business tracts in
his office. “Do It Now” would have been no
use to him. “Why the Blazes Didn’t You Do It
Last Week ?” was his motto. And, according to
the High Court Judge, he has been following his
own advice and doing it considerably.
THE NEW
COMMISSIONER.
It is said that the Government will appoint as
Third Railway Commissioner a gentleman who has
been much mentioned lately in connection with
the Victorian'railways. —News [?]em.
“ We know the Man!”
It isn’t often that a person awaiting trial
on an accusation of three murders is allowed out
on bail; but in the case of Olive Moodie, of Mel-
bourne, charged with the slaying of her mother
and two sisters, the coroner intimated that two
sureties of £5OO each would about till the bill. So
Olive is a sort of precedent in her way.
Concerning the new president of the John
Dunn Association of N. S. Wales
The most acceptable Christmas box that any N.S.W.
policeman has had for years was handed out last week,
when Superintendent E. C. Day was appointed In-
spector-General, vice T. Garvin, resigned. As a young
man Day came to Australia in a spirit of adventure,, and
joined the police in 1883. Almost immediately he was sent
to Mudgee, about the time when Thurston and Angel u'ere
bushranging thereabouts. The monotony of the life had
decided young Day that he would have to look elsewhere
for adventure, and his resignation' was actually lying in
the Sydney office on the day that Inspector Burns (who
was in charge of the party pursuing Thurston and Angel)
walked ihtd Day’s little station, and wearily announced
Sbhis men had broken down. Day volunteered his
is, got a horse and went off with Burns. “From
ation received ” the two officers made their way to a
n the district, and stayed there. The birds duly
1. Thurston walked in, and without begging
ly’s pardon or even opening his mouth,
;.he storekeeper stone dead. Burns, who was
rnuueii behind a cask of washing soda, jumped into the
proceedings and shot the murderer, and before the argu-
ment concluded Day had sent Angel to join the rest of
the tfamily. He was immediately promoted and with-
drew his resignation. A few years later, when he was
stationed at Nymagee, the copper boom was at its height,
and a local firm made him a good financial offer to
sign on with them as accountant. He again sent
in his resignation, but on the advice of Inspector-General
Fosbery withdrew it. He got his sergeant’s stripe then.
Later on he was at Newcastle, at a time when there was
considerable distress in the Wallsend district owing to
slackness in the coal trade. One night the present
Government Whip, Estell, met Day and told him
that he was on his way to a meeting which
had been called for the purpose of seeking ways
and means to relieve the strain. Day accompanied
Estell to the meeting, handed in a solid subscription, and
next morning shook up Newcastle until its purse could
hardly rattle. That kindly act was never forgotten,
and, in view of Day’s other qualifications, the man who
bumped against him when the appointment was recently
considered by the State Government had a big handicap.
Evidently the retiring Inspector-General thought a lot
of him, too, for when a year ago he wanted an assistant,
Day was the man he sent for, although at that time he
wasn’t even a superintendent.
A BRASS PLATE IN LONDON.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
And speaking of the High Commissioner, George Reid
is certainly in a good location amongst the other High
Commissioners, but his offices are situated about four
floors skyward, and there is nothing attractive about
them when they are reached by elevator. A huge brass
plate with the inscription “ Commonwealth of Australia ”
is the one guide to the important establishment.—Re-
turned traveller.
What better guide could one desire ?
A plate of china or of glass
Should tell the emigrant and squire
Beneath whose offices they pass !
Emblazon it with knife and fork,
And carve on it a frying-pan,
A champagne bottle and a cork,
And write “ George Reid—high trencherman.”

POLITICA
POINTS
What sorb of a fraud the alleged N.S.W.
sinking fund is can best be judged by the fact that
the balance in hand at the end of-the financial
year 1910 was less than the Commissioners had at
the beginning. A sinking fund is supposed to be
something that goes on accumulating. You pay
in £IOO,OUO and invest the money, and add the
interest to the principal, and go on building up
the thing that way. But the N.S.W. sinking fraud
provides that, when the £lOO,OOO is paid in,
Government stock worth £lOO,OOO shall be bought
and destroyed, and that ends the business.
THE TEACHER TAUGHT.
TEACHER: “ What separates New South Wales
from Victoria ?”
BOY : “ Politicians."
N. S. Wales does turn something between
a third and a half of. its land-sales money into
the Public Works Fund ; but S. Aus. isn’t honest
in this matter to even that small extent —it collars
the whole lot and treats it as revenue, which it
isn’t. The recent discovery thait mallee land on
the West Coast and elsewhere isn’t the desert it
was alleged to be has produced something like a
rush of land-sales money to the S. Aus. Treasury;
and, whereas the total income from this source
10 years ago was £16,840, this year it has been
£248,978, and next year it will probably be still
more. This is a small, disturbing fact which S.
Aus. might take'into account when it feels inclined
to throw up its hat on the strength of the largely-
bogus surpluses which it makes by selling its
rent-producing assets.
This is a busy New Year’s Day for Aus-
tralia. On that date the Northern Territory be-
comes Federal property, the compulsory military
training system becomes law, the Yassberra capi-
tal enters upon its official existence, and the
Braddon clause passes out. Therefore, it will be
well for Australia not to drink too much whisky
on January 1, but to keep its head clear for emer-
gencies.
Tasmania, the one State which has stuck
to Toryism through thick and thin, meets with
its usual luck. According to the estimates of the
Federal Statistician, the population of the Com-
monwealth increased by 29,659 during the quarter
which ended on 30/9/’lO. That is to say the popu-
lation of the mainland increased by 29,901 and
that of poor, old, decaying Tory Tassy, which only
once had a Labor Government and was so horrified
when it really awoke to the fact that it had
hysteria and threw the Ministry out in about a
week, diminished by 242. It is the sort of fortune
which always seems to drop on Tassy these days.
Said John Perry, smugly, in the N.S.W.
Assembly last week :
He did not know of any Minister yet who had ever
sneaked behind his officers when a mistake had been
made. The Attorney-General should take the responsi-
bility of his position on his own shoulders.
And yet Perry sat through the discussion on the
unsavory Ben Abdah case, wherein the spectacle
was offered of C. G. Wade (Perry’s chosen leader)
attempting to put the blame for the mistake of
freeing the abortionist from Syria on his subor-
dinate Garland, despite the fact that his (Wade’s)
signature stood on the minute that procured
Benjamin’s release.
The strange 'conviction that it is the busi-
ness of a State Legislature to bo a permanent
official grumbler at all thedoingsof the Australian
Government still possesses Gregory Wade. He
was a sad, disgusted man when the N.S.W. Legis-
lature refused to declare against letting what
Gregory Wade seems to regard as the wretched,
incapable, common herd decide by referendum
whether it preferred to entrust the control
of industrial legislation to the Commonwealth
or not. Though the Independents voted with
Wade, he went down by 12 votes. McGowen’s
alleged majority of one generally pans out at
about 12.
The great principles of Freetrade are
never to tax the foreigner when you can get at
the local man, and always to make dead sure that
your taxes won’t help along any industry—they
must be a mere dead incubus. British Chancellor
of the Exchequer, Lloyd-George, has attended to
this so successfully that his petrol duties have
made it impossible for the London ’Bus Co. to
pay a dividend, and his new licensing duties have
chased the old beer firm of Barclay and Perkins
into reconstruction and stopped its div. also. A
very old firm is Barclay and Perkins. It is
exactly 60 years since its draymen wiped up the
London streets with the Austrian Marshal Hay-
nau, the man who made history in Hungary.
The Weary Government hung a Railway
Loan Application Bill of £2,475,593 on to the
hindmost hairs of the tail of the disappearing
session, and got it through that way. Most of
the money will go in small extensions and addi-
tions to stations, etc., but four at least of the
proposals poke the finger of scorn at the Act,
which states that no new proposition that runs to
more than £20,000 may be submitted unless it has
been recommended by the Railways Committee.
Bent, however, drove his hoof through this Act,
and a decadent Parliament, which cared for little
except to keep its own constituents sweet, didn’t
kick; and Murray knew he was just as safe as
Bent was. The Labor Opposition did make a
mild effort to stop this flouting of the law, but
Treasurer Watt said they could do the talking
some other time, whereupon the subservient
Government majority passed the items and the
Bill.
There is something amazingly cynical
about the N.S.W. Labor Government these days.
A plank of its platform provides that there shall
be no borrowing for new works except such as
will pay interest from the start and 1 per cent,
sinking fund. Yet, in addition to the gigantic
schedule of loan works already on hand, Minister
Griffith proposed in one act, that 12 new railway
proposals should be submitted to the Public
Works Committee, and he announced the antici-
pated annual deficiencies to be : (1) £2348, (2)
£12,333, (3) £9333. (4) £2500, (5) £3BOO, (6) £5531,
(7) £6OOO, (8) £lB5O, (9) nil, (10) £9460, (11) not
stated, (12) £20,200. Yet there wasn’t so much as a
hint of any intention to build these lines otherwise
than by the same old loan. Some of the figures
were specially interesting: No. 2, estimated
revenue £7OOO, and estimated expenditure£l9,333;
No. 6, estimated expenditure £6700, and esti-
mated revenue £1169 ; No. 10, estimated revenue
£6OOO, and estimated expenditure £15,460; and
so on.
Melbourne Argus, on the sad, sore sub-
ject of Federal land-tax valuation, is even more
ridiculous than usual:—
The forms are to be issued about the middle of January;
the valuations will be returnable by the end of February;
by the third week in May landowners will be required to
send in their cheques, and anyone in default a month
later than that may expect to receive a demand for a fine
as well. . . . Does the Ministry suppose that with all the
penalties besetting them on every side under this statute
owners are going to content themselves with a rough
guess as to the value of their properties, and send their
assessment notices back to the office by return of post?
The answer to which solemn query is, firstly, the
landowners will have six weeks from the middle
of January for filling in their assessment forms ;
and, secondly, they will not be asked to guess at
any facts and figures that they have not already
had ample time for finding out. If the Argus
wail about the “ indecent haste ” of Federal land-
tax procedure could be taken seriously, it would
amount to a ghastly reflection on the intelligence
of the bloated capitalists who own the earth, and
who for months past have been taking measure-
ments of their possessions in order to arrive at
the exact amount of “cruel injustice” they are
about to suffer.
S. Australia’s income-tax figures show
what a time the State has been having. In 1903
the income-tax exemption was £135: S. Aus.
reckoned that when a man passed 50s. ! a week he
ought to be classed among the capitalists and call
no man uncle. Later on, the exemption was
raised to £l5O and last year to £2OO ; and more
people paid income-tax in 1910,
when the exemption was £2OO,
than they did in 1904, when
everybody who scored over £l5O
had to toe the mark.
THE CALL ON COHEN.
The Mayor (Mr. Cohen) believed the Destroyers were to
come to Port Adelaide, but personally he did not intend
to arrange any demonstration in their honor. Had the
Destroyers been from a foreign country, or had they been
British ironclads, he should have been the first to honor
their visitors. —News Item.
JAPAN (about the year 1915): “I’ve just called
about a welcome you mentioned some time
ago.”
Westralia boasts some great beef and
mutton producing country. It talked so much
about the matter that people began to
wonder why meat should cost from 7d.
to lOd. per lb. These explanations were
offered : (1) Millions of acres of the best
land in the Nor’-West and elsewhere are
leased to a few pastoralists at a nominal
rental. (2) These pastoralists control
the shipping between Fremantle and the
Nor’-West, and will not carry stock for
any outsider, particularly small holders ;
(3) Butchers who buy stock from anyone
but the big pastoralists are worried out of
business. Faced with these explanations,
the State Government appointed a Com-
mission. The pastoralists appeared before
the tribunal, and swore that for years
they had been carrying on business at a
huge loss, notwithstanding that vast sta-
tions employ about three whites and a
nigger or a Chinaman to every hundred
square miles. The Government, that
was going to run a rival line of boats and
bring the small man’s stock to the metro-
polis, fairly blubbered apologies to the
philanthropic pastoralists; and the bad
old state of affairs continues. There are
people, no doubt, who believe the squat-
ters and the meat-ringers; and they will
probably do as Bigjohn Forrest tells them,
and vote against the Commonwealth
having the power to deal with mono-
polies. But the people who, in a country
like Westralia, are charged from 7d. to
lOd. per lb. for meat are much more likely
to tell John Forrest that they will see him
fried before they will vote “No” in the
coming referendum.
They chanted the Dead March in the
Vic. Assembly last week, and the follow-
ing were decently coffined and buried :
Agents Bill, Crimes Bill, Gold Marking Bill, Scaffolding
Inspection Bill, Duties Collection Bill, Companies Deben-
tures Bill, Municipal Regulations Bill, Industrial Associa-
tions Bill, Railway Construction Expenditure Bill, Fruit
Packing and Sale Regulation Bill, Coroner’s Law Consoli-
dation and Amendment Bill, Public Library Officers Bill,
Preferential Voting (Assembly Elections) Bill, Matches
Sale Limitation Bill, and Amendment Bills relating to
Police Offences Acts, Mines Acts, Alexandra Act 1904, and
Closer Settlement and Land Acts.
These murdered “innocents” comprise 19out of the
37 bills that were on the notice paper ; so that the
Weary Government has put through 18 mostly
paltry measures in several months of actual work.
Altogether it is a memorable tribute to the hustle
of John Weary and the crowd that takes its time
from him.
The British Labor man is a strangely Con-
servative animal. Thus Ramsay Macdonald,
M.P., has been denouncing the referendum as
“ anti-democratic.” To shift the power from the
Tory peer to the Labor member is understandable
by Ramsay Macdonald. To go the whole demo-
cratic hog and shift the power from the Labor
member right bn to the people maddens Ramsay
and makes him. use cuss language.
lb now transpires that, at last N.S.W.
elections, one suburban electorate was partly won
for the Liberals by the use of hired Fire Brigade
appliances and firemen. There is no clause in
the Fire Brigades Act which permits the Board
of Fire Commissioners to compete with cabmen
by plying for hire at elections. Yet, for 12
guineas, the Liberal candidate (who happens to be
connected with the Board) got the services of two
men, whose regular job is looking out for and
hosing conflagrations, and the use of two cars,
which are solely intended to save the importer’s
warehouse from going up in smoke. The
men and the cars were away from their
stations for about four and a half hours;
and, during that time, the warehouse-
man’s risk of charred ruin was propor-
tionately increased. Staunch Calico
Liberals should nail the story to their
roll-top desks in case a big fire should
happen next election day. •
The row re the appointment of a
coroner at Moss Vale (N.S.W.) was a
sordid affair. There was first the spectacle
of local member McCourt in the van of
things urging the appointment of a man
of his way of thinking. On the other
side were Meagher and McNeill, Labor
members, urging the appointment of a
man of their way of thinking. They
weren’t local members, but apparently
one member has as good a status as an-
other in such a matter. But the local
police magistrate, being referred to, re-
commended McCourt’s man as the fittest,
and it is admitted that he is much the
younger of the two ; in fact the Labor
applicant is a man of 68, and consequently
far past the regular civil service super-
annuation age. His appointment at that
age and against the local P.M.’s recommendation
made the thing look like a job on the part of
Attorney-General Holman, and a clumsy job at
that.
N.S.W. Premier McGowen, whose alleged
policy is not to borrow except for works that will
pay interest and sinking fund, passed Loan
Estimates for £4,933,000 last week after an affable
discussion in the Assembly of quite five minutes.
Some of the items on the schedule are about as
likely to pay the interest charges as a moribund
bankrupt. Witness the item: “Cottages for
turncocks at Cessnock and Kurri Kurri, £800.”
By past experience, most of thb Government
buildings of this class in the northern district re-
solve themselves into white-ant nests in a very

few years. And at present the white ant isn’t a re-
productive work in the ordinary sense. Some
day, in the dim, dolorous future, he may be useful
to remove the remains of a deserted city at Yass-
berra and clean up the skulls and bones of the
dead dingoes in the water holes of the Cotter; but
that is far off and shadowy. Probably, by that
time the city will not have been built, and there
may not be any dead dingoes in the water-holes;
firstly, because there are very few water-holes,
and, secondly, because a dingo hates to be
squeezed for space when he goes to drown himself.

If you would grieve a “ Liberal,”
And plunge his soul in carking pain.
Point out to him his Labor pal
Has fallen in the soup again.
He hates to see a citizen
Turn to his fellow in a tram
And snarl: “ What price these Labor men !
The blighters are not worth a d n !”
The “ Liberal,” had he his way,
Would have his Labor rival score
Some bright, new triumph ev’ry day
To send his stock up more and more.
Behind the “ Lib’ral” visage you
May often glimpse the heart that aches ;
That worried look is mostly due
To one of Holman’s minor breaks.

The large, warm, salt, regretful tear.

Use phrases such as “ Fraud,” and smile,
And hint at cant. It is not so.

All pray that Labor may make good,
And dread to read its epitaph.

.22 CALIBER RIFLES:
Models 1902 and 1904 and Automatic
With a great many shooters, it is not so much
a question of which make of .22 caliber rifle to
get, but which Winchester .22. The cost some-
times decides this. Winchester Single Shot Rifles,
Models 1902 and 1904, are low in price but durable
and accurate. They shoot .22 Short and .22 Long
rimfire cartridges, and are used extensively for
shooting rabbits and for target shooting. They
have the strong and simple Winchester bolt action,
which has been widely imitated. The Winchester
.22 Automatic Rifle costs more, but it is the
only automatic shooting inexpensive rimfire
cartridges, and is a strong, accurate and reliable
shooter. It holds ten shots, which are fired by
simply pulling the trigger for each shot. This
is the most modern of modern rifles.
WINCHESTER RIFLES ARE SOLD EVERYWHERE.

A
WOMAN'S
LETTER
Sydney, December 26, 1910.
My Dear Arini,—
Sydney Town Hall can usually swallow its
audience with ease, and have enough chairs left
over to seat a few train-loads of people. The
occasions when it yearns to be able to put the
organ on the roof and extend the galleries a few
yards outwards might almost be counted on the
fingers of a man who had lost both arms in a rail-
way accident. The enormous exception rolled
along on Wednesday night, when the Svdney
Philharmonic, with the assistance of Soprano
Mary Conly, gave the usual Christmas perform-
ance of the “ Messiah.” The orchestra carpeted
the stage, and the vocalists banked themselves
solidly on the tiers of seats until the most remote
basso boomed his chest-music from the half-gloom
that lurks behind the towering organ-pipes.
Conductor Joseph Bradley waved no baton at
his carefully-drilled army, but, instead, clutched
with both hands at the enormous sound-waves
and worked them up into a storm, or calmed them
until they.receded and drained out in a thin
stream of violin wailing. Occasionally thepacked
choir uprose and joined with the orchestra, till
the organ woke up and poured out a mellow,
foaming cataract of thunder-notes ; then the great
chorus came down with a deafening crash, like a
falling tower, and the melody leaped over the
stage like flood-water over a weir, and everyone
was drowned dry and didn’t regret it in the
slightest.
Miss Mary Conly—or Mrs. Jarrett, to give her
name in law and church—whose voice, nowadays,
must be mentioned with reverence, soared with
angelic ease amongst the clear and star-like A’s,
and was rewarded with many encores and some
fine flora, for which she could hardly find room,
so crowded was the platform.
It is at the annual “Messiah ” production thatone
sees the out-of-the-way music lover. The regular
concert-goer or Liedertafeler is not discernible
in the throng. If he is there at all he is few in
the hill, and obscured by several thousands who
come only to town at “Messiah” time. No
oratorio given on a Christmas night has drawn so
great a crowd, and the success of the departure as
to time must have been like getting sand in the
mouth to the grasping City Council. The way
that body reached out after rent-money for the
Town Hall for Christmas night! But the long
arm with the money-scoop on the end of it
was put out of a job by the Phil, taking an off-
night at the hall’s usual rental, and scoring just
us heavily as if it had taken the place on the City
Council’s high-priced occasion.
Lady Poore was to have been present at the
opening of the Rawson Institute for Seamen last
Thursday, but she did not feel up to risking her
just-regained health by. coming through the
weather that now lies like a hot, wet
woolpack over our Sydney coastline. Gover-
nor Chelmsford, who presided, brought her
name into his opening homily ; so did the chap-
lain, the Rev. Allan Pain, who introduced it into
his few remarks. After Mr. A. W. Meeks,
M.L.C., had looked backwards over a space of 50
years, reviewing the history of the old Mariners’
Church and contrasting the shipping that then
entered Sydnej' Heads with the procession that
goes to and fro now, refreshments were served.
The very words “fifty years” make you feel you
want your tea whether you’ve had it or not. The
new building is in the nature of a memorial to
the late Sir Harry Rawson.
The projected residential clubfor women should
boom if it is intelligently run. Something of the
sort has been needed for years. Although
the well-to-do Sydney woman is largely
a suburbanite, who is anything from two
to ten miles from her home when she
reaches the city, she has never hitherto
had a place of her own to lay her head or
even powder her nose. European and American
cities possess innumerable women’s clubs that are
good paying propositions and a comfort to those
who support them. The only thing likely to ad-
versely affect the fortunes of the new venture is
the incursion of the blackballing person. The
habitual blackballer, male and female, has gene-
rally been allowed into the clubs, in the first
instance, as a matter of charity, more or less ; and
with many doubts and fears. Once in, this type
devotes its energies to keeping others out on any
absurd old grounds, from the way the candidates do
their hair, to the religious convictions they enter-
tain. Self-respecting people are loth tobe“putup”
for an institution where they stand to be frivolously
“ pilled ” by anonymous hands, and so the place
wilts. With a knowledgableand broad-minded elec-
tion committee, and a secretary possessed of other
than social qualifications (the ability to manage ser-
vants and to recognise good food in an uncooked
state are of more value than many ancestors),
there ought to be a future before the Women’s
Club.
It looks like a work of supererogation to send
ex-King Manoel to Australia and elsewhere, as
part of his training in the art of democratic
government, now that his chances of ever govern-
ing again are, irretrievably lost. It amounts, in a
figurative manner of speaking, not merely to clos-
ing the stable door when the steed has gone, but
to bolting it after the animal has passed through
the sausage machine. If Manoel decides to aban-
don the absurd and trying exclusiveness of his
Orleans relatives—who cling to all the discomforts
of the Royal state though deprived of its few ad-
vantages—there should be a chance for some bright
Australian girl to range herself comfortably in life.
On the score of looks there shouldn’t be any
trouble. After studying a recent portrait of
Gaby Deslys I became satisfied of my ability to
pick a dozen young women put of the Manly surf,
on any given summer afternoon, capable of giving
her lengths and a beating in all that should charm
the masculine eye. Manoel is comfortably off, if
European papers that should know are to be be-
lieved. For years his or his father’s Ministers and
legal advisers had been sending such surplus in-
come as they didn’t require for their own imme-
diate needs to London and Paris. There is no
doubt that they needed a good deal, but the
Portuguese taxpayer was always there to have the
deficit torn off him. In the final upshot a tidy
sum—estimated by the Cri dk Paris at £1,200,000
—accumulated abroad. Who would be a Southern
European monarch, menaced by the bombs of
loony anarchists and weddded to a shapeless
frump, when he could marry what alluring girl
he would and live in peace and privacy on fifty
thousand a year ?
Just ran across a girl who had slipped down to
Melbourne to see friends off by the Otway, and
saw, incidentally, the star passengers of the liner.
The new Mrs. Rupert was wearing a white coat
and skirt and a hat wreathed with poppies and
cornflowers. The first hint most of the pas-
sengers had of the amazing marriage was the
rack-full of telegrams addressed to the new lady.
Now that we are about to start an army of our
own in real earnest, even a discarded epaulette or
the remains of an old knapsack has an interest.
So you may care to know that the Captain
Greville Sartoris in “The Whip” is in real life
Captain Charles Blackall, senior Captain of the
3rd Battalion East Kent Regiment—The Buffs.
His appearance as a mummer is of quite recent
date. Blackall obtained his captain’s commis-
sion in 1900, and has against his name in the army
list the crossed swords which denote service in
the field—in this instance in South Africa.
The Buffs is allowed some distinction in the
manner of its marching into London, if I could
only recollect what. It is the only regiment that
may commit this peculiar foolishness, whatever it
may be. I rang up Colonel Ramaciotti and asked
him if the singularity consisted in its wearing its
spurs behind its ears, and he replied : “ Hardly,
as it is an infantry regiment.” He further sug-
gested that possibly it was the one regiment that
is allowed to march into London on all fours. As
this is the only alternative that offers, I cheerfully
adopt it, because it’s much too tiring weather to
go out rounding up any others.
One de Bucy, a French marquis and a British
major, is stirring Sydney society to its depths.
He is one of the area officers under the new
defence scheme. In appearance he is romantic-
looking, not to say beautiful. His wife, an Eng-
lish girl, is with him.
Met two young wives who accompanied their
military husbands to the Alburv area-manoeuvres
(that’s not the proper name of the gathering,
but you know what I mean), and they
report a few weeks of glorious time.
Several dances, innumerable teas, interesting
men —the time evidently wasn’t all spent in
plain living and high thinking. Nor was it all
plain thinking and high kicking—like the “Miss
Gibbs” musical farce.
Mrs. Harry Lassetter, who is in England super-
intending the education of the heir to the big
George-street shop, has been seriously ill. She
was smitten with the most complicated brand of
appendicitis, and only defeated the ancient Reaper
by a short head. When the mails left she was
proceeding to the family’s country place in Kent,
to recuperate. By the way, the Lassetters have
more residences, one way and another, than most
Australians. In addition to the Kent establish-
ment above named, they own (1) a villa at Oaden-
abbia, on the Lake of Como ; (2) a house in
Bathurst; and (3) Redfeaf,.Double Bay. By tear-
ing about the world with great energy, they
manage to put in part of every year in most of
them.
The Jim Osbornes leave on a trip to America
shortly. Their station, which is near Gundaroo
(N.S.W.), is a trying place in summer ; and, any-
how, Mrs. Osborne yearns to revisit her home in
that part of the republic where they specialise in
beautiful women and fine horses.
Mrs. Quesnel has gone to Melbourne for her six
weeks’ vacation from music and the young voice,
and the young head behind the voice that thinks
of London and its 6,000,000 of inhabitants. Before
her departure her students compelled her posses-
sion of an array of monogrammed silver things
for her dressing-table. Miss Lily Seton, one of
Miss Quesnel’s longest-time pupils, handed over
the Potosi goods. Miss Seton made so good at
her teacher’s concert a month or so ago that she
lias been encouraged to give her own concert early
in the New Year.
Amongst the short-distance departers are the
Philip Mortons and the Burnses, of Parramatta,
who have taken cottages at Manly; the Hayes,
of Wahroohga, who have blown over to Tas-
mania; and the medical Jamiesons, who have
risen to higher things—l mean places. They are
Bathurstwards.
The Feezes, of Brisbane (they pronounce their
name “Fates”), are at the Australia. He is a
K.C., but of more importance and attraction than
this com para ti vely-com mon distinction is h is pretty
daughter. She is a most graceful maiden, who
carries off with the utmost address a small, brown
hat that more resembles an inverted finger-bowl
than anything else that has yet emanated from
Paris.
Douglas Mawson, the brilliant young scientist
who covered himself with glory in the Shaekleton
expedition, and now earns a fairly well-buttered
crust at the Adelaide University, has undertaken
to lead one expedition to the South Pole and
another to the church. The other principal in the
church expedition will be one of the brainy
daughters of G. D. Delprat, who general-rnanages
the big Broken Hill mine. Papa Delprat is reputed
to have and hold more than eighteenpence; but
Mamma Delprat has strict opinions about the rela-
tive value of fripperies and education, so all the
Delprat girls must have a profession. Two of
them have taken medical degrees at the Adelaide
Uni.—which is how this latest engagement came
about. A third is pursuing higher musical culture
in Europe.
The character of our deceased friend Waratah
doesn’t improve much with inquiry. The cable
brings out the news by instalments, and quite a
number of witnesses seem to hold that the late
lamented was unstable and top-heavy, and wal-
lowed needlessly in the trough of circumstances.
On the other hand, there is evidence as to the
stability of the departed; but, so far, there
is very little of it compared with the volume
of testimony on the other side. The things
that are said about the rolling capacity of
the Waratah make me feel one moment that I am
hanging low down over a flattened waste of
water, and the next that I am heaved up
at the stars, with a wall of deck dropping
away at an angle of 50 degrees beneath my
feet, and all the Seven Seas at the bottom of that
wooden wall. I feel as if the court in which the
evidence was taken should have been anchored,
the whole narrative seems to heave so; and there
should have been a row of lifebuoys along the
Bench lest the whole case fell overboard. The
vessel is described as having a jerky roll
and a slow recovery —like a consumptive
patient or a bad debt. But the witness whose
words piost impress me is able seaman Bash,
whose only objection to the ship was that it would
never stand upright. A man with a name like
Bash isn’t imaginative or scientific ; and when the
vessel lies down so suddenly that his head strikes
the bulwarks with a great deal of the same sort
of thing that constitutes his name, he mentions it
in simple, unvarnished language.
A friend who is beginning to sit up and take
nourishment after illness, not far from Yea, in
Victoria, mentions that Miss Dorothy Grimston,
who came here to play in “ The Flag Lieutenant,”
is living a few miles from there with her husband,
Mr. Meyer. They have taken up some land, and
appear to know as much about farming as the
mopokes on their land know about the stage.
But they will probably beat the mopokes as
learners.
Writing from London on November 18, Miss
Kate Rooney mentions her view of the latest
thing in dances, “The Three Maidens from Sais,”
at the Hippodrome. The theatre and stage are
in absolute darkness; the only lighting conies
through the transparent back cloth, behind which
the three maidens prance like high-stepping cab
horses. It is a silhouette dance, and it is difficult
to realise that the trio are not going to have a
bath and had forgotten to pull down the blinds.
At every step the knee is raised to a level with
the waist, and that aids the illusion that they are
stepping over the side of a very high bath.
“ They are the thinnest girls I ever saw inside or
outside raiment, and give a skeletonic effect of
nudity. To call their claptrap turn a dance is to
miscall it, for they just ‘ high-step ’ or make a few
‘groups,’or tableaux, such as ‘Grecian Friezes’
and ‘ldolatry.’”
Miss Rooney is hard at work again, and is
booked as far ahead as St. Andrew’s Day—Nov. 30,
1911 —at the Royal Albert Hall. Also, she lifts
her contralto at the Gaelic Festival on March 17
at the Queen’s Hall. “Scarves,” she says,
switching on to fashion tracks, “ are everywhere.
Wherever there’s a well-dressed woman there’s a
scarf of black satin lined with a contrasting color
—white is most favored.” Three yards long they
are, and three-quarters of a yard wide, the ends
gathered and finished with a huge tassel about
eight inches long.
We are hearing less of late years about the
Gethsemane through which Australian singers
have to pass before they can afford strawberry
conserve on their bread and cream in their tea.
In a late issue of the British Australasian
“Peggy” mentions that two applications were
made to the paper within a fortnight for the
address of a singer for whom an immediate engage-
ment was waiting. The paper knew of none
wanting a job, and referred the applicants to the
Austral Club; but no Australian warbler had
registered a Voice to Let.
An advt. in a London paper :
p ARDENER’S Son, 24, sft. 10in., abstainer; as under-
VX gardener or single-handed ; ten months with motor,
and is a scratch golfer.
It reminds that Lord Dudley’s butler is a first-
rate golfer, and whilst in Sydney last winter played
constantly with his employer on Rose Bay Links.
The registry office providence interviewed by the
Daily Mirror reflection said :
A thing that I particularly notice is that in servants-
letters of character or references—and I have read many
thousands of them—the fact that a man has been able to
do something outside his regular iob is always specially
mentioned as a recommendation.
I mean, for instance, such little things as marking at
billiards, binding a bat or hockey-stick, filling cartridge-
cases, or taking an interest in the arrangement of various
games.
Most of us remember reading of the Irishman who
told! his prospective employer: “Yes, he could
beat; a coat —with a man in it. And .he could
clean a plate—faith, yes, there was nothing wrong
with his appetite.” In a morning paper of last
week or so there was a pathetic advt. from a
woman employer offering an easy place to a lady’s
help who would also be willing to mend the stock-
ings. “ Oh, the little more how much it is,” wrote
Browning, not thinking of golfing or darning.
I see that the Brock place at Brook Vale has
been opened to the public its a hotel, hash-house or
what not. It is an instance of a crying need
that was offered to the public before its time.
The cheapening motor-car and the swiftly-
spreading tram-line are rendering the time riper
and riper for places like this. Mr. Brock built
an ideal mansion which hardly anyone was able to
get at, and so he reaped no benefit from it. Now
all sorts of people can rush down and marvel at
the quaintness of the building and the perfection
of its site. A majolica mantelpiece that used to
belong to Larry Foley, and a ballroom which
has stables underneath it and a grandstand on
the roof are some features that one looks for in
vain in other establishments of the sort.
Mr. Reginald Goode and Miss Lilian Booth
were married on the 9th inst. at St. James’s,
King-street. Married to each other, of course.
Both have the run of musical and theatrical
paths in this city, and both are leaving this city
as “leads” in the newly-formed Ward-Winston
Dramatic Organisation.
A man rises in defence of the trod-upon school-
marm :
Dear Akenehi,—Please allow me a little grace, even if
I am late, to say a word in favor of the school-marm as a
wife. The one I am writing about knew absolutely
nothing about cookery in practice, but had a fair
amount of theory. When she got engaged,
friends openly pitied the man. The man argued
to himself (I know, because I'm the man) that
a girl who matriculates, has years in a training col-
lege, and comes out with a certificate, and is able to take
a school on her own and make a success of it —well, she
must have some brains. With modern cookery appli-
ances and cookery books, a brainy girl, no matter what
occupation she may have followed, can cook if she wants
to. Those that don’t want to, of course, are ex-
cepted ; nothing can be done with them. I main-
tain the girl that starts off scratch is easily
the most desirable wife, because she knows no
“short cuts.” If the book says “a pinch of
salt” it doesn’t mean a spoonful, and the pinch is all that
ffoes in. Writer knocked about Government camps for
years, and has sampled food covering a wide range of
hotels, camp and boarding-houses, and nothing beats the
food that was cooked “according to the Cookery Book.”
As to the baby-part—well; oh, well, the baby speaks for
itself 1
A daughter of Beecham, the millionaire pill-
maker, and sister of Thomas Beecham, the con-
ductor at Covent Garden, has gone on the stage
in England as a danseuse. She has taken the
name of Dolli, storing that of Beecham with her
large private fortune. Miss Dolli was presented
at Court, in the late Q. Victoria’s time, and she
has studied medicine and surgery. Now she is
determined to get work.
I trust.the following sees the light in print for
the first time. It is forwarded by a friend : “ A
farmer’s wife, sending an order to a Sydney
dressmaker for a skirt, concludes her instructions
thus : ‘ I do not require a hobble-skirt, because
our land is all fenced in. I seldom go far from
home, and when I do there are plenty of cow-bells
to hang round my neck.’ ”
From Melbourne comes a story of a big store, a
milliner and a consignment of spring models in
hats. The buyer secured the pick of the London
and Paris markets. The hats were ultra-fashion-
able, having scarcely any trimming. One quill,
for instance, or a single rose, a broad-
bean lying on one leaf, a violet with one
spear of grass, and the like. A new milliner
who had never been previously out of a minor
suburban shop was by some fluke in charge of the
swell showroom. She thought the models a
disastrous pretext for robbing the customer, as
well as a miscarriage of taste, and started in to
trim the “exclusive” specimens. When the
buyer arrived, a week after his consignment, he
did not know his selections. But the milliner got
to know some of his opinions.
Yours affectionately,
AKENEHI.

MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, December 26. 1910.
My Dear Yarrie,—
Things look like an extra prosperous New Year.
Certainly it has been a bloated Christmas. All
Melbourne seems to be doing its shopping by
motor. Cars full of excited children and flushed
mothers invade the shops, and struggle out laden
with armfuls of expensive presents and toys.
■‘Look what we’ve got for our stockings!”
shriek the modern children ; and poor old Santa
Claus simply groans. There is none of the old
delightful secrecy about the present-giving nowa-
days ; every child knows exactly what he wants,
and gives explicit orders to his badgered parents
--that is if hb doesn’t go along himself and choose
it. Poor Santa Claus, with his frightfully stuffy-
looking get-up, never did fit the climate, and
the keen Australian youngster refuses to believe
in him. As a myth, Claus is about exploded. In
time I think he will give up coming out to Aus-
tralia as a passenger on the Christmas number
covers of the Thames-side weeklies.
Somebody—doctor, undertaker or summer hotel
proprietor—always gathers what the ill wind sows.
With the one that blew on us before Christmas
came snow for the Buffalo Mountains. The
white-covered hospice on the heights almost
turned somersaults with delight. The glad news
was published, and tourists, eager for December
snow-balling, rushed up in such quantities that
many had to be turned away. All this while the
keepers of seaside resorts were uttering deep
groans. The white line of tents that runs along
the Aspendale - Carrum - Frankston coast - line
covered a painfully small population. The owners
of the canvas are in despair. When the weather
is right they collect 255. and 30s. per week rent,
without giving their tenants a bite of food to
make it look less like piracy. But just now they
are as dejected as Antonio, the ice-cream vendor,
who shakes a small spoon at the lowering sky and
curses the weather in choice Italian.
The city newsboys celebrated Christinas with
the usual joyous uproar, presents and food. The
Carmichael lady, who takes an interest in the
youngsters, sent along a load of, gifts to be
scrambled for; and the Cerberus men-o’-warsmen,
who attend to their sea-training, smiled in the
background.
About 27 people write to ask, “ When did they
doit?” and only one writes to give details. Let
this one tell her little tale: —
Rupert and Connie Waugh were married at the office
of the Registrar-General, and went on board the mail
steamer at once. The bride paid a visit to Geelong (her
native village) the day before her marriage, to say good-
bye to her relatives. The two contractors and one other
made up the wedding party.
I got a thrill the other day—but it was only a
friend’s fearful, spidery scrawl. “Did you hear,”
I read, “that Lady Linlithgow’s eldest son is
coming out to marry Miss ? ” and the rest was
a blot and a blur. And then I ravelled and un-
ravelled, and made out that what my friend really
wrote was, not “to marry Miss ,” but “to
unveil his father’s statue.” I hadn’t heard of it;
but then, there are so many things to hear, and
only two ears to do it all with.
Mrs. Fisher didn’t go to S’Africa with her
Prime Minister; but she took her little Australian
down to see the other two little Australians when
they came steaming into our harbor the other
day.
Just about the most striking feature of this
year’s fancy-dress show by Mrs. and Miss
Green’s pupils was Rita Lloyd’s Idol Temple
dance, with “The Arcadians’” number, “Bring
Me a Rose,” a close second. In this item, Mollie
Wall was more charmingly supercilious than
even Miss Gertrude Gilliam. Cherubs in
pink and silver tripped through a Cupid-
ean and fairy ballet; some fancy legs were
raised in another ballet, “La Reine Dijon”;
while, “La Rossignol” showed a pair of bright
eyes floating about over golden draperies. Coral
Whiteway gave some brilliant toe-work in a
poetic pas seul , d, la Adeline Genee ; Raie Cantor
dashed through “ Carmencita,” a danse espaynole ;
and Maggie Cocks indulged in the rapture of
an Amurkan step Frenchily' labelled “Fleur
de Soleil.” Olga Farnsworth, with a silver rope,
skipped through an event after the manner of
Miss Essie Perrin ; young Reggie Green tried
some leggy eccentricities; and several little maids
appeared in “ Boobery Boo,” a quaintly-infantile
song and leap. Amid all the fanciful and
original prancing and posturing, older favorites
like “ The Sailor’s Hornpipe ” and commonplace
ballroom measures were not ignored.
The art students reached the joyous edge of
the vacation last week and celebrated it with an
exhibition of work and a loose leg well shaken.
Laurie Taylor gave a fancy dress frivol at the
family mansion, at which each guest was given a
Chinese lantern on a long pole and told to hunt
in the gloomy garden for hidden treasure. The
merry searchers rushed about, and eventually un-
earthed the treasure —bags and bags of it. Then
they sat down and devoured it. A pirate king
said hoarsely that he had never eaten better pea-
nuts, though he had sailed with Kidd, who, as is
well known, would shoot any man for a penn’orth
of fresh-baked.
Mrs. Munro, a pretty young widow with red-
gold hair and a golden banking account, took!unto
herself another husband, on Wednesday, 21st,
in the person of Mr. William Wheildon, who hails
from Thames-side and is connected with the
Brooks-Robinson firm of house-beautifiers. The
wedding occurred at St. Peter’s, Parson Hughes’s
church on Easter Hill, and the breakfast was served
in a private room at the Grand Hotel. It was a
quiet affair right through ; the party numbered
Mall told, and they gathered round a circular King
Arthur table, decorated with pink carnations.
Oak branches and gum-leaves overhead served as
a wedding-bell. The bride wore a dainty grey
frock with a grey-plumed hat for the church part
of the celebration. When she became Mrs. Wheil-
don, she slipped into adorable blue tailorings and
a travelling hat. Afterwards, the pair fled in a
taxi to the Loongana, bound for Tasmania and
three weeks’ motoring. On their return, they in-
tend to live at the Grand.
The Mr. McG.eorge, whose engagement to Miss
May Hepburn was recently mentioned in this
letter, is, I’m told, the McGeorge whose painting
was bought by the Felton Bequest people for the
Melbourne National Gallery. Miss Hepburn is a
Gallery student, and the nest the pair are erecting
is to be built and lined with the beautiful red
jarrab of Westralia. Most of the furniture will
be fixtures ; so visitors who hurriedly try to pass
sitting appliances round and disarrange the room
will get plenty of jars.
Burly Parson Hughes, of St. Peter’s, Eastern
Hill, a week or so back married a 26-year-old
bride to her fourth husband. The oft-widowed
lady was wedded first in 1902 ; her second venture
was made three years later ; the third knot-tying
occurred in 1907. Her latest mate has 27 years to
bis credit—and, I hope, a good balance in the
Bank of Luck.
Dainty dancer Essie Perrin, who is engaged to
Fred Kruse, is to come back to Australia later on,
when she has finished her stage contracts, for the
orange-blossom and confetti ceremony. After
that the graceful fair girl will settle down to be
an Australian.
The second Fenner girl is on her way back from
foreign parts; so the other blue-eyed Fenner
maiden will look less detached. How they ever
managed to separate Ido not know. The return-
ing sister travelled off with Gladys Chirnside
what time Mrs. Chirnside was changing her
widowhood and her name to Hodges. Gladys
soon tired of nursing as a hobby. She used to
drive to the private hospital in a hansom with her
maid and a day’s change of clothes; but even that
touch of luxury couldn’t compensate for profes-
sional discomforts.
At the Independent Church last Thursday,
Hester Gwladys, one of the chicks of the cherubic
Dr. Bevan, was given into the care of Charles
Phillip Russell Hurvitch amidst a shower of good

Dr. Eccles’s girls, who went travelling with
their mother, forsook her in Germany and re-
turned to their adoring daddy. Mamma, who is
a brilliant pianiste, stayed on in Berlin to gather
up a few more points. Daughter Muriel is to
be married in February to her military fiance,
who came all the way from the Fatherland to de-
mand her hand.
Some of Melbourne’s most select spinsters are
again hoping for the best. Bachelor Duncan
MoCrae, a big western squatter, is airing his 78
inches on the Block and bracing himself up to
meet the land-tax. Also, widower “ Billy ” Kiddle
is around again, putting in much time at the
Athemeum Club. Daughter Rita has returned
with Mr. Kiddle. It seems that her sister, Maggie
McCann, was in the Paris railway accident a
while ago, but escaped scratchless and even
shock less.
A well-known Melbournienne in our midst
again is Mrs. Major Maloney, most ardent of
first-nighters at the theatres. During a year’s
jaunt the Maloney dame has seen everything
worth mentioning, including the Pope and the
Oberammergau Passion Play. Her report on his
Holiness is enthusiastically favorable. His smile
is an inspiration, she says.
Elaine Macdonald, only , child of journalist
Donald Macdonald, of the Argus, was married
last week to Mr. Whittle, a young engineer she
met whilst travelling in Papua. The young
woman steadfastly refuses to leave father; so
the young pair are to have quarters in Moora-
binda, the family seat at Balaclava. The house
is rambling and wide, and has a wilderness of gar-
den, with a large pond, full of nature-study
material. Daughter Elaine has the bump of hos-
pitality well developed, and it used to be her
delight to give impromptu dances, the invitations
to which were usually by telephone. The
guests used occasionally to prance on the gar-
den, and “Observer” next morning, survey-
ing the damage, would threaten to track down the
offenders and demand a gardening bee. Mr. and
Mrs. Whittle are just now at sunny Sorrento,
enjoying the ocean breezes and the Christmas
crowd.
The Bland Holt pair departed a week or so ago
for Fogland, via Egypt. Their objective is, the
Coronation. Before leaving these parts they had
a word or two by cable from Rose Musgrove, who
is now Mrs. Planter Somebody, saying that she
would meet them at the boat and show them
Colombo. “Well, and blissfully happy” was
added as a postscript.
A woman-lecturer lately said she was sure the
quality most attractive to men was gentleness.
“ Hear, hear ! ” said a poor wretch at the back of
the hall. One could see his wife ! For my part
1 think the appealing brand of woman attracts
men most. The sort that asks every man’s advice
and opinion. And when she’s got there the melt-
ing blue eyes forgot to melt, the babyish mouth
develops into a steel trap, and the man realises
that there is one iron will in the establishment—
and it isn’t his. Still, much depends on the man.
A clinging vine of a man may be most comfort-
able with a woman of strong character. She
saves him so much trouble, she orders his affairs,
and makes up his mind for him. The average
man is most repelled, I should think, by the
woman with too much to say. “ Learn to listen,”
I advised a bud the other day. “Yes, I’m trying
to,” she snapped. “ I listened to a man. talking
about horse-power for two mortal hours the other
day. I could have screamed. But he told some-
one I was very intelligent. ”
City streets have a new terror for pedestrians.
The, raw pupil motorist is found zig-zagging
everywhere, and he is just as liable to murder
with the back wheels of his machine as with the
front. The schools in which you can learn to
shove are. as numerous as ice-cream carts on a
public holiday; their training grounds are the
public highways, and you need to cultivate an
eye in the back of your head and learn how to
spring like a grasshopper in any given direction
to keep your insurance society from worrying
about you. The youthfulness of some of the Mel-
bourne drivers is appalling. Often, when they
take off their goggles to mop their brows after
missing an M.L.A. or ocher valuable curiosity
by the length of a young rabbit, the pink-
and-white cherub face of a 16-year-old is disclosed.
I hear that the young shovers are comparatively
cheap; so our lives are in the hands—or under
the wheels—of infants.
The charities are doing well this year, and bun
feasts rage in every direction. Some parsons are
seizing the chance to go for record collections. A
Ballarat pulpiteer recently tottered into his
vestry with a plate heaped with £2ooo—the
triumphal result of a prayed-over appeal. Some
women dragged off rings and other gee-gaws and
flung them on the pile. Presumably the verger
will either melt the jewellery down in the crypt
or call,round at a pawnshop.
Melbourne feels that it really ( cannot allow
George No. 5 to be crowned without its help.
“ Of course,-we-are going to the Coronation!” is
the current boast of the people with spare cash
and time to squander—these people who make
the yearly trip to distant London with as much
nonchalance as they trek to their chalet by the
sea for a summer week-end. They would make a
week-end of the London, gad if flying ships were
just a little more comfortable and a trifle safer.
The glad news is announced that Melba will be
seen in grand opera next September under the
direction of Williamson, Ltd. The star has picked
out Eileen Cattles for engagement in the sup-
porting company.
A proud dad these times is Kozminsky, the
Austral Hat Miller, whose parental jubilations
are due to his son, Leslie. That hopeful young
native, after a training at Wesley College, went
to America five years ago to take the course at
Columbia University. He was the first Australian
to get the mining diploma there. Last week he
arrived at the higher degree in metallurgy. And
all the time he has been gaining practical experi-
ence at some mine in Utah which has a working
staff of 4000 men. Now he is returning to the
Melbourne home with his University honors
thick upon him, and the sacrificial calf is being
carefully fatted for the occasion.
The Baiilieu building, which is rising from
behind barricades in the busiest part of dignified
Collins-street, is composed of massive blocks of
sandstone, which, if I remember right'v, is the
geological substance with which Abner Dean, of
Angel’*, was laid low when he rose to a point of
order. I presume the stone came from Sydney, as
usual. There are not many other sandstone build-
ings in Melbourne. Traveller-author Carl I.uff-
mann said once that Sydney had as old a look as
some of the most ancient Asiatic cities. He
put it down to the many warm-colored sandstone
edifices that sit by Port Jackson.
Alf Deery and Lucy Carter are notable samples
of local good looks and good style in the “Gay
Gordons” show. Alf makes a hit in the Echo
song, “I Love You,” with Kathleen Starling and
chorus; whilst Lucy Carter (the dainty heroine
of the Hurst Boots advt.) figures as a principal
beauty-girl with picturesque results.
The Maoris, who are departing for London and
the Coronation after their Sydney season, had a
gorgeous farewell dinner at the Chicago before
leaving this city. Maorilander M.P. Manson
was host, and several other Parliamentarians were
guests. The Chief made presentations and
speeches, which Maggie Papakura and Manager
Lewis translated into plain Australian. One of
the pretty young girls did an impromptu poi
dance, while Maggie, in her deliciously soft voice,
chanted the music#
Cook, the Yankee doctor who nearly drove
Peary mad by claiming to have discovered the
North Pole, reached New York last week, with a
ready-made typewritten interview for the re-
porters in his hand. He came by a steamer
called the George Washington. This lifts him to
the top of the cherry tree as a humorist.
Archbishop Carr sent a long and costly cable-
gram to barrister Frank Duffy, to bring him back
to Melbourne on behalf of the clerical defendant
in a forthcoming cause scandaleusc.
The most futile man of the week is a sport-
ing person of Melbourne. He had promised
a girl a Christmas present, but somehow the
festive season found him without the money.
Calling at the girl’s house on Christmas Eve he
ttas requested to fetch a jug of beer for supper.
He hadn’t the money for that either ; and rather
than file his schedule on the premises he took
powerful measures. Going forth with the beer
jug he solemnly banged his head hard against a
tree and got concussion of the brain. When
found, he said that he had been assaulted and
robbed, and that sort of thing is so common in
Melbourne that there was really no reason why
he shouldn’t have stuck to the story. But, later
on, he weakened and owned tip. So the public
scorn and the head concussion were all for
nothing. As a final ignominy, he was found
by a bottle-washer whose front name was Ernest.
One might almost as well be rescued by Fer-
dinand'.Hogsflesh.
From “ Rosna,” of Adelaide: —
The Battenberg princeling came ashore from the Oni rail
the other Saturday, and Lord Dick Nevill, descendant
of Plantagenets and friend of kings, assisted by our aide,
Captain Fletcher, welcomed him, and directed him and
his doctor to the Residence.
The same afternoon his Excellence and Lord Dick
visited our first Henley-on-Torrens. It was a praise-
worthy effort considering its youth, and the whole town
turned out in its honor. No less than 30 decorated boats
grappled for prizes, lirst honors being caught by Zoe
Reid’s craft. This was treilised in effective tones of
heliotrope and pale blue, and carried a human freight to
match. Second prize went to Mr. R. Reid’s poppy-clad
gondola. The motor-launch, carrying the mayoral folk
and other officialdom, also had poppies in its ear. At
night the craft drifted round in an illuminated state,
while the Orpheus Society sang ditties from the boat-
house balcony. The weather was vile. Winter has
spent practically the whole of Christmas week at
Adelaide.
The Flayers, an amateur company, gave “ Charley’s
Aunt” at the Theatre Royal two nights last week, and in
spite of torrents of rain one night and freezing blasts the
next, a big crowd went along and cheerfully paid only a
shilling less than ordinary theatre prices. Nor was this
lavishness misplaced. J. H. Lipman played Charley’s
relative with gusto ; and Leslie McDonald and Harold
Tretheway were a pair of spontaneous undergrads. Jean
Robertson and Rebe Bloom were the two girls ; and
Sophy Saunders was the real aunt, who ought to have
looked 20 years older.
At the moment of writing the weather prophet
is cheering up in favor of the Port Racing Club, and get-
ting into a sky-blue dress for the meeting. The club has
made such leaps and strides during the past few years
that this fixture has had to be converted into a two-days’
corroboree to cope with all the steeds that want to leap
through it.
Letters of administration have been granted in connec-
tion with the wills of Mrs. Alexander Hay and her
daughter, who were passengers by the Waratah. Mrs.
Hay leaves a codicil, in which a will is mentioned ; but
no will can be found. It is suspected that she had it
with her on the Waratah, or else that it was burnt when
the Hays’ lovely place at Port Victor was destroyed by-
fire, a few months before they sailed for Europe. But
the Court accepted the testimony of those who knew
what the will was made of.
Mr. Owen Smyth,who is Lord High Panjandrum of
Public Buildings in South Aus., has left his edifices in
charge of a minion and departed with his wife and damsel
for a four-months’ trip to Shanghai. The damsel is to
be married to Mr. Edwin Godfrey, barrister of the Middle
Temple and member of the Shanghai law firm of Ellis,
Hays and Godfrey. Having given his daughter to her
benedict, Mr. Owen Smyth will return to his buildings,
cemeteries and other bric-a-brac.
The Mayor and Mrs. Cohen are giving their usual New
Year’s eve party at the Town Hall, when officialdom and
its wife and daughters will sup and see the New Year in.
Randolph Whirlwind Bedford swept into Adelaide last
week from the Bullfinch. Shouting that he would be
back in a fortnight, he sped furiously on in the direction
of Melbourne.
Mr. C. J. Stevens and his choral society sang “ The
Messiah ” to a goodly audience, at the Town Hall, on
Tuesday night. The chorus work was remarkably good
in segments, and four champion soloists fought for the
laurel wreath. They were Muriel Cheek, Laura Hum-
phries, Alexander Cooper and Francis Halls.
Miss Dawson and Mr. Rupert Dawson, daughter and
son of the famous, whisky house, have been staying in
Adelaide. They are putting a waist-belt round the
globe.
The Shakspeare Sylvan Salon folk gave a concert at
their pretty baby theatre last week. Jn between whiles

GREEN OLD AGE.
An Elderly Coople, Both Over 80 Years of
Age, Praise Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills.
Growing old ought not to mean growing weak
and feeble. It does not mean weakness or feeble-
h
ĥ
ħ
h
ness for those who e.-i t
with a pood appetite
and sound digestion.
It is therefore of the
utmost importance
that old people should
retain the power to
digest and assimilate
food, which is the
sole source of physical
strength. To those
in declining years
who find that Nature
responds less readily
to the demands made
upon her, and who
need a mild yet
searching remedy to
keep their system in
proper working order,
there is nothing like
Dr. Morse’s Indian
Root Pills.
Mr. Boswell, at 82
years of age, and his
wife, at 81, testify to
the great benefit de-
rived from Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills.
“ I have been a resident of Mudgee for 52
vears,” states Mr. R. Boswell. Gladstone Street,
Mudgee, N.S.W. “ About 10 years ago my health
beeran to fail me, and I suffered very much from
a sluggish liver and palpitation of the heart; the
attacks would come on me so sudden that I would
fall helpless to the ground. I often fell asleep
when having my meals ; nothing that I could do
would keep me awake. I constantly had a nasty
taste in my mouth, and a thick coating on my
tongue. I tried many medicines, but it was not
until I had tried a bottle of Dr. Morse's Indian
Root Pills that I got relief. The attacks of palpi-
tation were considerably less, and in a few weeks
I was perfectly cured. It is marvellous how your
pills have restored me to health, especially at my
extreme old age, and it is wonderful the vitality T
possess. My wife, too, has had great relief from
their use, and we always have a bottle of them in
the house.”*

SPORTING
NOTIONS
The December meeting of the A.J.C. at
Randwick (Sydney) was proclaimed the usual howling
success. And so it was, from the Bill Sikes standpoint. .
The punters, after being cleaned out in the ordinary way,
were stood on their heads, shaken thoroughly, and then
put though the vats in a last desperate effort to squeeze
coin out of them. When favorites did win, the prices
were such as made wagering an act of lunacy on the part
of the punter ; and when the other sort got home there was
nobody on ’em. The public was invited on Saturday to
gamble on the running of 157 horses, but was slipped up
to the extent of having 82 scratched at the last moment,
after most of the wagers had been made. On Monday
159 horses were listed to run, but only 01 started, no less
than 95 being withdrawn. So in two days the public
was tempted to bet on 316 horses, of which only 139
actually started. And yet a “sport” which allows this
barefaced burglary is attended by the salt of the earth,
and the “ great dailies” compliment it on its “ success.”
Eighteen started in the Trial Handicap on
Saturday, and the price laid against the winner, Eunella,
was eight to one, after the field had been reduced from
47 to 18. The winner of the Villiers Stakes, Rady
Ruenalf, started at three to one against in a field of 13
(15 originally listed). Gidgiel, winner of Saturday’s Nur-
sery Handicap, beatl2others ; and after the original 31
had been reduced to 13, the best that was offering against
him was four to one. The Grand Stand Stakes was quite
a modest swindle, only seven being scratched from a list
of 13. Son of the Marsh, the winner, started at three
to one against. The Holiday Handicap saw a list
of 23 reduced to a field of 10, and the winner, Byplay,
went out at five to two against. The day’s robbery was
finished with the High-Weight Handicap, in which a list
of 28 materialised into a Held of 15, and the winner, Blue
Gem, started at six to four against. This is “ sport" !
On Monday the ball opened with the Christmas
Handicap, in which 26 were scratched and 13 started.
The winner, True Spec, paid four to one. The Flying
Handicap saw 16 scratched and 12 start, the winner,
Irishman, going out at four to one against.
The December Stakes saw a small list of 11 re-
duced to a smaller field of five, and the winner,
Milfoil, paid a whole six to one to such as were lucky
enough to bb on him. Needless to say they were few
indeed. With only three scratched in a list of 15 for the
Summer Cup, Patrick Moses could only afford to lay two
to one against Britain ; But this may have been due to
the well-known loyalty of Moses, who probably disliked
laying anything against the name. But he came out of
his shell in the Nursery Handicap, and wildly splashed 10
to one against Veneta ; but then of 30 on the list only 13
started, and presumably Moses had collected something
beforehand on the 17 that did not start. The great gem
of the meeting was the A.J.C. Handicap, in which a field
of 37 was reduced to nine starters, and P. Moses laid only
three to one against Blue Gem, the winner. As the
attendance was said to be high up among the records for
Boxing Day, and as betting was brisk, the number of
fools is evidently on the increase.
The only horse to score on both days of the
meeting was J. Samuel’s Blue Gem. He started in the
last race of each day and won both. In addition to this
he ran second in the Villiers Stakes on Saturday. Gid-
giel, winner of the Saturday Nursery Handicap, made a
game effort to get home first in the December Stakes on
Monday, and ran into second place. They laid four to
one against him on the Saturday, but on the Mon-
day his . price had dropped to seven to two
against. Veneta, winner of the Nursery Handicap
oil Monday, when Moses laid 10 to one against,
also started in the Nursery Handicap on Saturday.
On that occasion Moses was taking no risks, and laid-only
eight to one against her; but the fact that she could
finish no better than sixth evidently inspired him to
take fearful risks on the Monday. Had Blue Gem suc-
ceeded in the Villiers Stakes on Saturday, several pen-
cillers would probably have fallen dead at the awful risk
ihey had incurred. On that dreadful occasion they laid
33 to one against him. Later in the day, when he went
out for the High-Weight Handicap, his price had
dropped to six to four, and on Monday he started at
three to one against. These variations in prices are
interesting, also bewildering.

The Onkaparinga Racing Club, the S. Aus-
tralian country body which has its one solitary meeting
of the year on Easter Monday, has just issued its pro-
gramme. It will give £2650 in stakes for the day—more
than double the figures of 10 years back. But what it is
specially proud of is the low entry-fee. It reckons “ that
owners provide the nucleus for the sport,” and should not
be made to build up the stakes they run for. The' totali-
sator brought in £2OOO to the club last Easter, so the cost
to start in the £5OO hurdle race is £2, and for the £lOOO
steeple £5. (Compare £lB and £2O for the “ Australian ”
hurdles and steeple of 1300 sovs. and 1500 sovs. respect-
ively.) The club points out that back in 1895, when it
gave £2200 for the day, it took £790 from owners; last
year, with stakes at £2650, it charged them only £421 in
all. “This policy the committee hopes to extend in the
future, and for it the sporting public, owners and trainers
have to thank the totalisator.”

Bananaland’s champion gee-gee, Barallan, added
another jewel to his crown on Monday by comfortahly
gathering in the 300-sov. Newmarket Handicap at Eagle
Farm (Q.). He was burdened with the mountain of
list. 51b., in comparison with the molehills of from
Bst. 81b. down to 6st. 71b. on the backs of 11 opponents ;
but that didn’t matter to Barallan.
Some good diva, fell into the coffers of punters
at inter-State race meetings on Monday. Fastness, by
winning the Port Adelaide (S.A.) Cup, returned a div. of
£37 ss. ; and Katoomba’s success in the West Aus. Turf
Club Plate yielded £2l 10s. Of course, it was the tote
that paid such prices. As a contrast, at the Randwick
meeting—from which the tote is banished—the wildest
outsider returned odds that did little more than cover
the price of the tram-fare.

The return cricket match between Queensland
and N.S.W. commenced at Sydney Cricket Ground with
an unpleasant surprise for the Ma Staters. Captain
Waddy, having won the toss, went to the sticks, and a
nian named Bernard Cook got busy and whacked
down five Cornstalk wickets for 34. But Barnes, Wat-
son and Makin managed to stem the rot with
62, 38 and 71 respectively, so that, when the
side had vanished, the fair score of 207 was
on the board. Queensland did not shape so well with
the bat as with the leather, but, nevertheless, at the end
of the day had piled up 122 for seven wickets. The dis-
turbance continued on Monday, and Queensland was
shifted for 182, leaving Ma 25 to the good on the first
round. N.S. W. then entered on the second three
minutes, and was promptly dismissed for 107, thus leaving
133 between Queensland and victory. The highest score
was Watson’s 28, and Cook had taken three wickets for
26, while Redgrave had gone one better with four for 19,
and Barstow had done his little mite with two for 23.
This put fresh heart into the Bananalanders, and they
entered on their second smack in great glee. R. B.
Minnett became Noo South’s last hope, taking three for
27, but in spite of him, Queensland at the close of the
play had accumulated 98 for the loss of three wickets.
It required only 34 to Win, and Had seven Wickets to
fall. Things looked bad for the Ma State. On Tuesday
the agony ended fairly early. Queensland lifted the score
to 133 for six wickets, and thus won through by four
wickets and one run. Queensland has come on this
season in a remarkable fashion.
* * * *
W hile Queensland was making a holy show of
the Ma State's second team at Sydney Cricket Ground,
the first XI was performing on the Melbourne Cricket
Club's Ground. Laver won the toss, and as soft rain was
falling he winked the other eye at the Cornstalks and
remarked • “ Boys, this ground' ’ll get worse before it gets
better ; so get in quickly.” Bardsley and Trumper went
in, and, getting busy, scored 111 before lunch. Then*
apparently the mayonnaise disconcerted Trumper’s eye,
and the second ball after the resumption almost got him.
The fourth wholly did it and the first wicket fell for 120.
By the tea adjournment the score had risen to 253 for four
wickets, and at the drawing of the stumps the Ma
Staters had piled up 331, of which 124 were due to
Bardsley.
The Victorians started, but the stumps were
drawn with one run for no wickets standing to their
credit. Resuming work on Monday, the Victoria crowd
piled up 252 before Cotter got the last man. Cotter was
the hero of the bowling, securing four for 60 runs.
Weather and wicket were perfect, and N.S.W. men felt
that when their second opportunity came they would
show the people things. But the showing is now to be
spoken of in whispers, for, when the stumps were drawn,
three State wickets had fallen for 70 runs. Summed up,
the Ma Staters were leading by 149, and had seven
wickets in hand, and the Gumsuckers were 149 in arrears
with a whole innings to go.
On Tuesday the aspect changed considerably.
Barbour, after Emery had skied one from Laver
and been caught out, was joined by Trumper,
and Barbour felt like reciting extracts from “King
John.” Then it was that the scene changed. Bar-
bour and Trumper made a great stand, Barbour
smashing up 82 before he was caught by Ransford off
Laver, and at time of writing Trumper was still going
strong with 89 to his credit, and Kelleway, who had joined
him, had slogged up 27 on his own account. As this
issue went- to press the N.S. W. score stood at live wickets
for 266 ; so the position, was that, although Victoria has
a whole innings to go, N.S.W., with five wickets in hand,
is leading by 345. Hence, anything is possible, which is
a beastly unsatisfactory state of affairs for a Tuesday
evening. # # #
Tasmania perpetrated a cricket joke this week.
The North sent a team to I-lobart to play the South, and
at Hobart they got it down and fell upon it. The whole
side was booted out for 67 runs, Boddam taking four for
eight runs and Carroll six for 29. Then South went in to
show the benighted visitors how to do it, and smacked
up 451 for the loss of two wickets. On Monday night a
wight named Hawson was humping his bat for 238, and
another named Hudson had fallen to a M’Donald after
pasting 167 on the scoring board.

The brilliant-on-paper cricket district of East
Torrens (S. A.) is in the soup at present. It, held the local
premiership last season, going through without a defeat,
and has this year supplied seven men to the S.A. XI.
But Crawford has revived an old injury to his shoulder,
Whitty is mostly away in bigger cricket, while Mayne,
t.he two Chamberlains and the two Hills (Roy and
“ Soil v”)are all strangply uncertain. So the district was
at half-season bracketed fifth among eight. North
Adelaide is easily top ; Gehrs and Rees play for it, also
Rei'dman. Claxton and Pellew, who, though dropped
from the State team, are as dangerous as ever in club
cricket. Reedman has been playing for over 20 years.
George Giffen, who has been playing for over 30, turned
out in a district match this month ; he made 0 and nine,
and thok one wicket, i >

One of Sydney Stadium’s best fights was that
between American Billy Papke and Australian Dave
Smith on Boxing night. Unfortunately, it ended badly
for the superior man, who, by being fouled in the tenth
round, was robbed of a decisive victory over the
“ Illinois Thunderbolt,” at present billed as the world’s
middleweight champion. And this was no small
thing to lose, particularly as the fight was practically' all
over,bar carving up the gate receipts. Papke had been
cleaned out in every part of the game, excepting through
two early rounds ; he had been punched half a dozen
times for every wallop he had landed ; he had vainly
lumbered like a bear after his sharp-footed and keen-
witted opponent ; he had turned on his right shift and
found it hardly worth a doughnut; he had
stood off, bunged in, tried the lot; and be had arrived at
the time when the only man he wanted to meet was the
fellow that turns the lights off, though all through he
had battled like a fighting Irish navvy. Suddenly, in a
mix near Smith’s corner, Papke switched a blow for the
body, and Smith dropped as if a bullet had gone through
him. Simultaneously his seconds and the crowd yelled
“foul,” and “Snowy” Baker started counting off the
time allowance. But he did not count Smith “ out,” and
when two well-known doctors climbed into the ring he
(Baker) wisely withheld his decision until they had ex-
amined the stiffened fighter. Meanwhile, old pande-
monium was raging ; and when Baker tried to say
“ Smith the winner,” he could not be heard. It was only
by pointing at the prostrate mail that the verdict was
niade clear. That bit of pantomime was followed by wild
bursts of cheering.
All things considered, Papke was bound to lose
that fight, bar an unforeseen accident. If both men had
gone the 20 rounds—and the chances are that that would
have happened—he would have lost on so many points
that it would have taken a firm of accountants to
reckon them up; and if there had been a knock-
out Papke appeared to be the gent likely to
put himself in the way of it. The victory should give
Smith an opportunity, as he is young, clean-living and
level-headed, a keen trainer, good boxer and willing to
learn. He appeared on Boxing night to be down to
about middle-weight poundage, and lighter than Papke.
The Stadium management announced that both men
weighed list. 111 b., but when the crowd shrilled its
unbelief the management didn’t offer to bet about it.
What with the weight-trouble and one thing and another,
the Americans are not making themselves any too popular.
* * * *
One night last week Mr. J. Clabby, of America,
invited E. Williams, Esq., of Melbourne, round to
the Sydnev Stadium to discuss matters, appertain-
ing to trade reciprocity. Both gentlemen ate ex-
porters of wallop in considerable quantities, Mr.
Williams handling the middle-weight brand, and
Mr. Glabhy welterweight samples. Several thousand
members of the School of Arts, etc., whose keen
interest in these matters speak well for the future
of the town, attended in the expectation of a keen
debate, but' the)' were disappointed. Mr. Clabby had
all the best of the learned discussion, and hammered
his friend’s point so effectively that Mr. Williams ad-
mitted his inability to continue the argument.
Williams, who was 91b. heavier than the
American, gave an exhibition that was enough to make
his supporters pursue him home with hunks of cold
hlanc-mange. He went into the ring beaten with funk,
and for the 11 rounds he remained there he resolutely
avoided hurting his opponent, apparently in the hope of
being' lammed less severely than might otherwise be
the case. The opportunity to sober Clabby up was re-
peatedly as open as Bell’s Life, but Williams merely
patted it on the head and passed it along. Time ana
again the Yankee, with his peculiar alternations of bril-
liancy and crudeness, was floundering about like a New-
foundland pup ; but Williams, appearing to see only a trap,
clinched convulsively or fled backward like a panic-
stricken, clawing cat' True, after throwing in the towel,
he held up a damaged hand and endeavored to explain
something above the hooting. Perhaps he was protesting
that Clabby had stood on it. It was difficult to see how
else it was injured.

On Tuesday afternoon the cabled news that
Bill Lang had wiped the floor with Jack Burns, of Cali-
fornia, gave a fresh thrill to a community that was still
drinking the delight of having produced a bruiser who
had succeeded in downing the Papke \ankee. The
scrap was brought off at the Olympia, in London, under
the management of the Mclnstoush, and the duration
thereof was 12 rounds. Australian pugdom is feeling
good this week.
* * » *
Cullen v. Buckland was an ill-judged arrange-
ment, which came off in Melbourne Athletic Clubs
arena. Cullen is a lOst. American, a compact little
fiirht.er of excellent second-class merit; Bnckland is an
Australian, 9st. 91b., who has not shown himself to be in
the same pugilistic street as the visitor. On this occasion
he was several blocks off. Cullen waded in and demol-
ished the Gumsucker in about 4J minutes. Soon after
the first rest the Yank planted his left on Bucklands
chin, and before the latter shook off ths respiting tired
feeling lie was so soundly pasted that the referee deemed
it advisable to call Mr. Cullen off, and give him what was
coming to the winner.

Hugh Mclntosh is coining money as a London
fight-promoter, but he is seriously annoying the old
hands in the process. A 1 Bettison, of the National
Sporting'Club, is said to hover on the edge of epilepsy
each time the Mclnstoush’s name is breathed in his hear-
ing. A charge levelled at the Australian is that be is
“spoiling” the British pug. Hitherto, the professional
fighter of the Bulldog breed has been a humble person.
He touched his forelock deferentially when addressed by
ins “ betters,” and went through the blood and dust
and agony of fistic strife for a paltry fee. He was a
shade above the criminal and several points below the
bookmaker. It is Mclntosh’s habit to treat the pug as a
friend and an equal. Moreover, he pays him 50 per cent,
better than the National Sporting Club. It is not sur-
prising that British pugdom should be flocking to his
standard. The only danger that, menaces Mclntosh lies
in the fact that others, noting his methods and apprecia-
ting their wisdom, have started imitating them. The
Sydneyite is not to have a monopoly in the fight-
promoting line, if certain British and American ex-pugs
with a bit of capital to invest know it.
There is a craze for boxing in England just
now, and the chances are that much fight-promotion
may ruin the game for all hands. It is the well-adver-
tised scrap that stirs the great heart of the wowser
British and otherwise—to protest. As witness the out-
cry here over the Burns-Johnson trouble —an outcry
that lias never been repeated, though, since then, fights
many times more gory have been brought off. If
Mclntosh and his imitators stage a few really big mills
well-advertised affairs that attract the descriptive writers
of the daily press—there will be a sudden loud howl from
the self-righteous of,Britain, and the fight game will fall
dead. It is possible that an appreciation of that fact is
at the back of part, at any rate, of Bettison’s hostility
to his Australian rival.

“ Hermes ” : I don’t like throwing stinkwort
bouquets at any man, but this alleged performance of
Mr. Otto Camphin, who claims to have driven his car at
night from Sydney to Goulburn (132 miles) in 3hr. 18min.,
convinces me that these affairs should be run under
proper clocking conditions. It was a phenomenally fast
run anyhow ; but, considering that Mr. Camphin had to
go slow and turn back a little way for a lost lamp, it was—
well, a very surprising run. And it.all depends upon his
own watch. Which is quite absurd. His watch in this case
may have been slow, while at another time his watch
blight be fast. He claims to have reached Goulburn at
5.18 a.m. ; but when asked what time Mr. Camphin
passed, someone connected with the gate declared
the time to be “ about five minutes to six.” It is
a discrepancy of only 37min., but it gives Mr. Camphin’s
record a groggy look which makes this writer rise to move
that in future all such events should be properly clocked
by responsible people. Then good performances wouldn’t
look groggy.
In fact, the whole motor-car record business
wants putting on a sounder and wider basis. At present
each would-be smasher is a law unto himself, and as each
one runs his own race it is hard to compare their
performances. It is absurd to set the deed of
a man who shares a.run from Melbourne to Sydney
with his driver against that put up by a man
who sticks to his own wheel right through from
start to finish, and carries the whole heat and vibration
of the job in his own swag. Yet that is done when the
records of Messrs. White and Camphin are compared
with that of Sydney Day. Day drove his own jigger right
through. The others were relieved by employees.
Kellow and James shared the honor; as they shared the
steering of the car. The records should be split up—one-
man records and two-(or more) men records.

C. A. Proctor, many years secretary of the
Australian Dunlop Co., now in Europe, writes that road-
racing as conducted there is a professional business sim-
ply. The various makers have stipendiary teams, the
members of which are paid £4 per week each, and do
nothing but train and ride in the interests of their em-
ployers. Against these trained fliers the cheerful ama-
teur has, of course, no possible Dope.
At 5.42 p.m. Tuesday week a small-featnred
man in riding knickers, his face and legs tanned almost
black, rode up to Anthony Hordern and Sons’, in Sydney,
and inquired for the manager. His name was Francis
Birtles, and he had just completed a bowl round the con-
tinent on one of the firm’s bikes shodden with made-in-
Australia Dunlop tvres. He left Fremantle, in Westralia,
on October 28, 1909, and rode to Sydney, where he stayed
a few weeks, and then resumed the whirl on March 5,
1910. Running through Queensland and the Territory,
he covered 9200 miles in 357 days, his speed being occa-
sionally accelerated by man-hunting parties of natives.
While in Perth he was suddenly seized by a desire to
break Donald McKay’s long-standing record of 40 days
15 hours from Perth to Sydney, which had stood since
1900 or thereabout,. Birtles covered the 3350 miles in 38
days, thus chopping over two days off the Port Hacking
athlete’s time. McKay’s record for round the continent,
of course, still stands, he having covered the 11,500 miles
in 7 months and 28 days. Which was a very marvellous
performance. ,
Birtles has hiked between 50,000 and 60,000
miles during the last five years, and, naturally, is about
full up of that form of excitement. He is only 29 years
of age, but 30 is the time of life when such exploits
begin to strike one as not worth the trouble. So now
Birtles wants to go aeroplaning, and sail over the same
ground and take photographs in comparative ease from
ud aloft. There is much horse-sense in the desire.

The curt announcement in the evening papers
of Monday that Pearce had won by two lengths looks
like a fairly plain hint from Destiny to William of
Wanganui that he is down and out for ever as a sculling
champion. On the other hand, in spite of the acclama-
tions of Pearce’s friends, this victory does not by any
means prove that he is likely to down Richard the Row-
ing Machine. Poor old Webb (although he is only 32) has
gone down-stream very rapidly. He appeared like a
meteor, and Stanburv, Charles Towns and Dick Tressider
were lost in the blaze of his glory. Then Richard the
Rowing Machine blew in, and in one act Webb dropped
to a star of about the third magnitude, and his glory has
eve’ since been diminishing so fast that Pearce will need
to beat somebody else before he establishes a reputation
as a world-champion to be.
Webb who should now retire, was born at
Lyttelton’ (M.L.) in 187 S, and hud an exceptionally
brilliant career as an amateur, losing only two of 28 races.
He started in 1896, and ended as an amateur in 1906. it
was on August 8, 1907, that he became champion of the
world bv defeating in 20min. 44sec. the dubiously entitled
Charles Towns, who had received the honor as a gift from
brother George. Dick Arnst tore his laurels from him on
the Wanganui in 1908 in 19min. 513-ssec. Pearce, although
champion of Australia, has never held the world title. He
scored a win over the present English champion, Barry,
in 1902 in open skiffsover li miles. He has also met Dick
Arnst or rather, followed him home, with 2£ lengths
between them. His present grip of the championship
dates back to his win over big Ben Thoroughgood in
19d9 and he has fortified it by defeating J. Mitchell,
George Day (twice), and Frank Hagney. He will now,
presumably and providing the money can be found,
have another go at Richard the Top Dog. The writer’s
money will be located in the boat of Arnst when the
twain'meet if it is within the next 12 months. Pearce is
30 years of age.

TheN.S.W. Skiff Championship on Saturday-
on Port Jackson fulfilled the Scriptures, which say that
the race is not always to the pro. nor the scrap to the
trained pug. All the crack open-hoat skippers had been
hired to steer the craft to victory, and they all got licked
l,v a real dved-in-the-wool amateur in the person of U.
Roderick, who steered the little Pearing over ihefinish-
jn<r line with a margin of 26see. between himself and that
Goliath of the game, Chris Webb, in the Middle Harbor
boat Cornstalk. No less than 27 started, and made a
magnificent sight. Probably the size of the field had
something to do with the unusual amount of interference
which the boats were subjected to. Clumsy motor craft
crowded with pretty girls ; sailing boats packed with
half-naked, howling hoodlums; ships, schooners, yachts
and, finally, the steamer following the race—all these got
mixed up with the competitors, or went crashing through
them, bursting chances left and right. It was a sight to
make the gods who guard skiff-racing weep, and the
skippers used fearful language. But it was useless. And
out of the pandemonium and confusion Roderick steered
the Dearing to victory. A great performance.

Probably the last clot on the blood-stained
aviation record of 1910 is the death of Cecil Grace, the
English aviator about whom the cables have been so busy.
A miper that is attracting a lot of attention just now is
the Baron de Forest competition for “ the furthest flight
into the Continent.” This affair is darkly suspected of
being subsidised by the British War Office. The prize is
£4OOO, and is ostensibly given by Baron de Forest, who is,
by the way, an Austrian noble specially authorised by
royal license to use his handle in the United Kingdom.
Curiously enough, this apparently-foreign gentleman
stipulated that the machine must be entirely of British
manufacture, and that the aviator himself must be a British
subject, domiciled in the Empire for at least two
years before making .the flight. The prize has been
bn the stand since January, 1910, and closes
ori the last day of the old year. So far, the
longest flight was that of a gentleman with the un-
romantic name of Sopworth, who, the week before Grace
started, had flown 177 miles. Grace made a great start
and crossed the Channel safely enough, but appears to
have tripDed or been unable to, scale the imaginary line
known as"the Belgian frontier. Adverse winds got the
discredit of this curious obstruction, and Grace turned
for England, Home and Beafity. He was seen off Rams-
gate—or rather glimpses of him were caught through the
mist. He appears to have been unable to see the land
beneath, to have got utterly lost, and, wheeling round,
to have made back again. From then till time of writing
he has not been heard of. But wreckage—spars and
canvas—has been observed drifting in the North Sea, and
the conclusion arrived at was that it was the remains of
Grace’s aeroplane.

The year 1908 saw only one aeroplanist—Lieut.
Selfridge, of the United States—killed. Not till one year
later did the next fatal accident occur, and then two
happened on the same day—one in Franco and one at
Rome. 1909 saw two more killed, within 15 days of one
another, and the butchery ceaseil with the death of Fer-
nandez on December 6. But it got to work early
in the new year. Delagrange was killed at Pau on
January 4, and between that date and December 3,
inclusive, 27 aeroplanists literally bit the dust,
Of the original aeroists there must be only about
three or four left. The aeroplanist knows exactly
what is going to kill him. He is going to die by concus-
sion. But the gentleman who takes his flight abroad in
a dirigible has a pleasing variety of deaths on which to
regale his nerves. Three were drowned ; four were killed
among the clouds, struck by lightning-; and five were in
a balloon that burst at a height of 2470 ft. What they
died of is hard to diagnose. Anyhow, aviation in either
dirigible or on a ’plane is a very good sport for people
with weak hearts to leave alone.

TX7HY make yourself uncomfort-
¥ able with an old-fashioned
corset when you can have the latest
physique effect and be comfortable
with our New Directoire Corset.
"A pudding bag with a string around it. n An
old-time description which applies to many
figures today—thanks to the ordinary corset.
This "pudding
string" effect is
bad both for
health and for
style.
The corset to
wear is one
which gives that
smooth flowing
physique that
holds one together comfortably —healthfully.
On these lines Madam the new D & A Directoire Corset will be a
revelation to you, as to style, comfort, health, —it will give you a physique no
other corset can give.
We spent thousands of dollars perfecting this corset. Our designer studied
correct styles where they are created —Rue de la Paix; where they are
worn —the tea rooms Rue de Rivoli, the race-track at Longchamps, the
promenades where the leaders of the fashionable world congregate —and
finally, moulded on the human foim, we evolved the D& A Directoire. Ask
your draper to show it.

A-
IN BANANA LAND
Brisbane society was deeply distressed to
learn recently that Agent-General Robinson and
High Commissioner Reid were not on speaking
terms. Luckily, Brisbane TeIiEGUAPH discovered
that these two eminent gentlemen breakfasted to-
gether a few days ago and laughed uproariously
to hear about their alleged disagreements.
Arthur Morgan staggered the Queensland
Fossils the other day by coming down out of the
President’s chair in order to protest against the
western boom scheme, and to draw attention to the
Kidphilp’s wild financial burst. Echoing John
Bright, Morgan said : “The demon of extravagance
is abroad in the land he could see the footprints
in the legislation and administration of the hour;
but on its heels would inevitably come the tax-
gatherer. He might have added that Queensland’s
last “burst” was followed by special retrench-
ment as well as a poll-tax. But most Queensland
electors seem to have forgotten all about that, and
are clamorously bellowing for more loan money.
Apropos the fury of Private Enterprise
because the N.S.W. Government intends to do
whatever work it can by day labor, the Queens-
land Government drops in with news about its
latest experience. The school newspapers, now
printed at the Government office, cost only half
as much as when P.E. had the job of supplying
them, and the price of copybooks has dropped
from 2d. and in some cases from 3d. to Id. So the
State is going further, and is building a new
Government Printing Office—said to be the second
largest of the kind on the globe. The U.S. office
at Washington holds first place.
“ Phoenix ”: A Bananaland par (B.
8/12/TO) states that Supreme Court Judge Chubb
was the first immigrant to get a land order in
Queensland. I may be in error, but I think it
was the Judge’s father; for he, with his family,
settled in Ipswich about that time, and practised
there as a solicitor for several years. Judge Real,
about that time, was serving his apprenticeship
to a cabinet-maker, and soon after kept a cabinet-
maker’s shop in East-street, where he worked at
his trade. Sullivan, another Queensland bar-
rister, was born and reared in the same busy
little place. His father, P. O. Sullivan, repre-
sented the town in the Assembly for many
years. With a large and compact following
from the ' “ ould dart,” he made things
lively and willing at election time, he did.
Ipswich then was the depbt for all the wool and
produce from the Darling Downs and Outback
stations. From there it was conveyed to Brisbane
by water. All the bullockies, shearers, shepherds
and station hands used to congregate at Ipswich
to knock down their cheques, and the place did a
roaring trade. < Even when tjie railway was built
over the main range to Toowoomba and Warwick,
Ipswich was still the Alpha and Omega for the
traffic. Notwithstanding that the distance to
Brisbane was only .25 miles, all efforts for several
years to extend the line were futile. The
“ bunch ” of members for West Moreton and Ips-
wich invariably blocked it. At length, however,
the continuation of the line to the capital was
effected, and great lamentations were heard when
the trains disdainfully flew past the ancient
terminus.
The Bananaland Government has just
made a grant of £3OO to the widow of Essex
Evans, though a grant of this kind was refused to
the widow of Brunton Stephens in 1903. Also, the
good folk of Aberystwith, in Wales (whence
the Evans family hailed), have written to Bris-
bane for complete copies of the works of the
deceased poet. Sometimes the poet does get
honor in his own country—when he’s dead.
Rockhampton is bent on having wool sales
of its own, even though the associated Sydney
and Brisbane buyers have written to say (1) they
are opposed to the scheme ; (2) it is impossible;
(3) it would entail too much travelling for them.
Rockhampton, which has as much wool grown
behind it as any Australian port, has merely
pigeon-holed the letter. It has an idea that if
the wool-men in the back country agree to save
freight and offer the fluff at their nearest port,
the buyers will be there all right, even if they are
rather fat to travel comfortably.
The Queensland Premier, when urged to
fix a minimum wage of 10s. a day for navvies en-
gaged in railway construction in the Far North,
twitted the Oppositionists who were advocating
the measure in this fashion : “ It’s easy to be lavish
when dealing with other people’s money.” Only
a few weeks ago civil servants getting six and
seven hundred per annum received rises of fifty and
one hundred pounds a year, and theKidphilp never
grumbled a moment about that extravagance. As
the Premier candidly remarked when the Coalition
was formed, “ We are now playing to the dress
circle ! ”
NO HELP WANTED.
THE STEWARD : "Is there anything I can bring up for you ?”
THE TASSENGER : "No, thanks. I’ll be able to do it myself in a minute .”
“Denny” Keogh is again threatening to
desert Phidston. He says that the only thing
which \yill prevent him//taking the dreadful
step is a survey of the proposed railway line from
Rosewood to Rosevale in his electorate. The
grab for the loaves (which in this case ought to be
spelt loafs) and fishes is pretty frank and un-
ashamed in Bananaland these days.
“ Stan ” : The spectacle of the C.S.R. in
the rdle of a fairy godmother, is presented by the
publication of a memo, from the head office to
the various mills, with the glad tidings’that the
co. has resolved to give a bonus to all permanent
employees of an amount equal to the sum which
these fortunate persons have paid into the co.’s
superannuation fund for the last two years. This
is all right; but the co. rather gives the show
away by the following suggestive remark:
“ The management considers that such an action
by the C.S.R. is justified by the fact that
the wage-earners have never yet made application
to the Arbitration Court for an award.” Quite
so! C.S.R. employees, from the solar-topeed
creatures who boss the mills to the humblest
“ chipper,” are taught the gospel of complete
obedience. Outside the ballot the employee is as
much a bond slave of the co. in a political sense
as the Senegambian was on the cotton fields of
Alabama 50 years ago—that is, if he wants
to keep his job. If he doesn’t, and
is indifferent about the fine susceptibilities
of the big dividend machine, he has only to ven-
ture within the tabooed area of Unionism, and
then proceed to grease his swag straps. As for
applying to the Arbitration Court for an award,
I doubt if a hundred men ranking as permanent
employees within the C.S.R. could be got to take
combined action. Union organisers know this
well, and I know it well, for I’ve been there.
Aeroplane and Parachute.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“ Love up-to-date carries wings—and a parachute.”
OLOVE, it is the aeroplane
That lifts the lovers liigh,
And carries us on fairy vane
To kiss the giddy sky ;
But when we’ve winged the heav’ns awhile
And cleft the airy main,
We’re glad to grip the parachute
That gives us earth again !
In sooth, it is a pretty thought
To kiss among the stars,
To rise above this sordid earth
And leave her squalid bars ;
But most of us who’ve spent a day
Among the clouds are fnin
To grip the handy parachute
And get to earth again !
Now, they who crave to live on high
Should be of cherub kin,
F'or mortals weary dreadfully
Of ether pure and thin ;
So when the Venus-pinions droop
Beneath the summer rain,
Thank Heav’n, we’ve got a parachute
To bring us down again !
We don’t decry the aeroplane,
A dainty craft is she ;
With blushing blossoms fore and aft
She flashes fair and free ;
But when for several days she’s swept,
With natty nymph and swain,
How do they bless the parachute
That brings them down again I
There never yet was butterfly
That kept a-wing an hour
Without a wish to seek below
A shelter from the shower;
And Love is but a butterfly,
Of short and sunny reign,
Whose wing must act the parachute
And give him earth again !
QUEENSLAND.
F. BORN.
QUEENSLAND GOSSIP.
Brisbane, December 24, 1910.
My Dear Thargomindah,—
Two weddings of much local interest, which will
occur here on January 11, will be those of Mr. A.
Jardine and Miss Harding (of Ipswich), and Mr.
Brodie and Miss Abbott. Both grooms are sign-
ing on for the second time ; the first Mrs. Jardine
was a Mossman.
February will see another wedding in the Light-
ollar family, when Miss “Dickey” and Mr.
Murray Prior will put up the banns. Sister
Minnie and husband (Carl Palmer) should arrive
from their European honeymoon in time to throw
a shoe after the motor.
The House where talk is the principal pastime,
and log-rolling the main indiscretion, has been
wrapped up in a nice clean holland dust-cloak for
the summer vacation. What the newspapers are
going to do I don’t know, and already the editors
have shown signs of that depression which leads
to slovenly work. Otherwise how could they
have missed the party that gathered, with tears
of devotion in its ’umble speech, and besought its
leader to wear a diamond pipe, twosilver-mounted
gold studs and a sleeve-pin. In consenting
to so deck himself, the recipient recalled a certain
previous meeting of the party, when he had
announced his intention to resign, and had
received a unanimous request to continue in the
job. He had consented to do this only on con-
dition that he had the most loyal support from
them all. They promised, and that promise they
had loyally kept, and behold —the railways ! And
much more to follow if the support held out.
Just here the cheers became deafening, and I
found myself with two other fellows standing on
the same chair waving my brolly amidst musical
uproar.
As a consequence of this extreme amiability in
the ranks, the rumor that Wullie will pack his
carpet bag in February and depart for London,
with a view of tapping Abraham in re that little
Ten Million loan, may not be so very far from the
mark. In that case Denham will probably meet
the party on the doormat of next session with a
certificate of acting Premiership.
The week has been one long, boiling Christmas-
tree, the weather clerk having apparently lit a tire
under the thermometer and forgotten about it.
Anyhow, the mercury has been bubbling over the
ceiling of things, and Brisbane has wallowed in a
free Turkish bath day and night. I could forgive
it for what it has done to me ; but, then, it has
upset our new University Professor Steele. He
arrived last Friday (that unlucky day again), and
was at once taken in hand by the Macgregor and
led to the vice-regal lodge. For so much honor
lie ought to have been too grateful to mind a little
inconvenience, but it seems that between the
weather and the exertion of being introduced to
about 2,000,000,000 mosquitoes, he developed dis-
turbed nerve centre or some such trouble, and
when last I heard of him he was sitting on a block
of iced soda in a mosquito-proof cabinet.
Many nice people have gone seawards, and tales
of bridge and boating parties float me-ward along
the coast. Miss Cooper and Miss McDougall (who
is slowly recovering froma tedious illness) leave for
Southport next week ; and Speaker Joey Bell is
also nearly ready for a “sandand sun ” excursion.
Your Mario spent a portion'of this day in that
model Government institution, the Diamantina
Hospital for Incurables, and there made the ac-
quaintaneeof a record case with thesolenameof Sid,
who has been a-bed for 19 years come Boxing Day.
On that day, 1891, he met with an accident while
riding the favorite in a race, and has never risen
from his back since. Yet he manages to keep the
brightest heart in that sad place, and still takes a
keen interest in the old game of gee-gees. He
gave me a “straight” tip for Monday, and I have
a conviction that I am going to make my fortune.
Speaking of hospitals naturally brings me back
to the General, and the fact that Santa Claus has
been calling upon the 19 or so little scarlet fever
patients there, thanks to the generosity of several
members of Parliament and other maligned
beings. There’s a lot of human nature in human
nature after all.
The Parker singers are back from their Sydney
visit. Vera and her voice have grown an inch or
two, and so has her platform reputation.
Another young Queenslander, back also, is little
Miss St. Ledger, who has been scooping in musi-
cal medals for piano work in Victoria. And while
we’re dealing with the subject, I must remember
to tell you that that pair of energies, Misses Bertha
Morrison and Florence Micheli, who last week
ran a concert of their own on the Sand gate pier,
succeeded, with the assistance of the cooling
breeze, in drawing all the “best” people to hear
them. And the “best” people, having heard
them, said what is equivalent in “best” circles
to “bonser.”
One of the Morgan brothers (J.S.) passed out of
Time’s calendar last week. He was the least
heard of in that advertised family, but, none the
less, was a good citizen.
As I fold up this epistle come greetings from
Beatrice Day and Tempo Piggott, the latter
enjoying every minute of the Maxwell dramatic
tour through the Apple Island. Also comes the
news of the death of Florence Everett (Mrs.
Lett), which sad intelligence recalls the fact that
she was the first lady to go ahead of a theatrical
show on the road here, having successfully steered
the Maskelyne and De vant people through Queens-
land. She used to say that we had the politest
tram conductors and the best penny cakes in the
Universe.
Yours affectionately,
MARIO..
“Skidadle”: Various Bulletin writers
have lately introduced their most strenuous lady
friends—’possum-trappers, shooters, etc. I reckon
Cairns (where the white man can’t live) owns the
most strenuous of all—a professional female wood-
jammer, who swings her blade from morn till
dusk, cutting and splitting mangrove ; and when
pay day comes she draws as much as mosc men on
the job. She is not a wild, formidable creature
who deals out death to interviewers, but will sit
on her log and have a yarn sociably and sensibly.
She is tall, straight and muscular, and prefers her
chosen occupation to charing or other such jobs.
I have seen many a woman shut her eyes and
make a mighty swing at a deal box to keep the
pot boiling ; but this is the first I have struck who
chops to keep the pot filled.
“The Prodigal”: “M. Magee” doubts
my statement (B. 1/12/TO) that “in most hotels
in Western Queensland the Chow is cook.”
Nevertheless, I repeat with emphasis “the Chow
is cook” in most hotels in Western Queensland
and in all the leading hotels, without exception.
" M. Magee ” advises me to pick up the Worker
and seethe legend, “ A white cook,” advertised
largely. Well, I have looked, and found the
“ white cook ” mentioned in only about a tenth of
the hotel advts., and not one of them can be num-
bered amongst the champagne-swilling palaces of
rest. The growl concerning the Women Workers’
Unions in Charleville, Longreaeh, etc., is a side
issue ; but, in justice to the women’s unions men-
tioned, it is only fair to state that they have
succeeded in getting a rise of wages for house-
maids and cooks in some western towns.
“A. W. A.”: You can’t lay it down that pro-
spectors are either optimistic or pessimistic, for
they are both, with all the progressive stages in-
tervening. Long Peter, well known in the North,
was the most inveterate optimist I ever knew. I
have occasionally backed him in his quest for tin
in the Herberton mountains, and have been lured
on to spend hard-earned dough on his enthusiastic
assurances that “she was going down rich and
strong and reg’lar.” Afterwards I have been
hurt to find that “she” was only as thick as a
knife-blade. On one occasion Peter coaxed a
number of his backers to inspect his latest El
Dorado. After a climb of an hour, during
which the climbers were in constant peril
of falling off the side of the mountain, the claim
was reached. A glance at the pothole sufficed to
damp the ardor of all but Peter. “ Where’s the
lode?” asked one of the party, bitterly. “Ah,
but ain’t she got a purty tip!” answered Peter,
casting a hopeful eye down the mountain side.
Long Peter held it a good sign for a lode to pinch.
“Good prospect of her making again,” he said.

Melbourne City Council’s increasing ten-
dency to pass everything on to small committees
has at last annoyed a few democratic members.
For years the supply of horses for street-cleaning
has been a practical monopoly to two firms,
though the council has stables of its own, and
could easily carry out the job itself. Lately the
Public Works Committee once again asked the
council to endorse its mere say-so, but the pro-
testors kicked so vigorously that the motion was
withdrawn. The same happened in connection
with a proposed contract for wood blocks, and
also with a tender for printing, stationery, etc. A
curious feature of the business was that the Works
Committee’s chairman said he knew absolutely
nothing about the recommendations, the proposed
contracts having apparently been settled by the
council’s officers in much the same way as they
would hire an office boy or sack a street sweeper.
Yet these aldermen are never tired of twaddling
about the “ caucus” methodsof the Labor party.
The beautiful pendant and chain-bag presented to
Mrs.C. G. Wade were made at Messrs. Hardyßros., Hunter-
street, Sydney. They are very beautiful indeed—almost
beautiful enough to compensate the lady for having a
husband who is too busy saving the country to spend
much of his time at home.
G. D. Greenwood, a wealthy Maoriland
racehorse owner, explained in a recent Supreme
Court action at Wellington (M.L.) how he evaded
Fat’s eternal nightmare—the taxation of his
hoard. This was his patriotic method :
He found himself with a sum of over £52,000 on his
hands. In order to avoid payment of the graduated
land tax, which would have proved a heavy burden, he
had looked for an investment elsewhere, and had sent
£35,000 to the Argentine for investment at 9 per cent. ;
most of the balance to Queensland ; while the remainder
he had put into racehorses, because there was no tax on
them. They were about the only things that were not
taxed.
So Greenwood took to the sport of kings and
spielers. He might have founded scholarships,
encouraged art, helped the sick, fed the hungry,
put a bit towards establishing a small-arms fac-
tory or building a war-boat for the succor of his
country on that sure day when the bullets will
splash through plebeian and plutocrat alike ; but
he didn’t. And the time will probably come when
the sorriest man in his neighborhood will be
G. D. Greenwood.
Somebody wrote to London Daily Mail,
the other day, saying that it was about time Aus-
tralia woke up and did something; whereupon
George Meudell, who happened to be in London,
dropped in this little brick :
Here are a few Australian champions— most of them
without peers in the world : Sculptor, B. Maekennal;
jockey, P. Wootton ; billiard player, George Graj T ; swim-
mer, P. Beaurepaire ; diver, A. Kellerman ; lawn tennis,
A. F. Wilding; oarsman, R. Arnst; soprano, Melba;
contralto, Ada Orossley ; artist, Norman Lindsay ; orator,
Alfred DeakiVi ; actress, Marie Lohr ; actor, Oscar Asclie ;
pianist, Percy Grainger; cricketer, W. W. Armstrong;
pigeon shot, Donald Mclntosh ; inventor, Louis Brennan ;
entrepreneur, O. Stoll.
“Do something ! ” exclaimed Meudell. “Aren’t
we busy doing it all the time ? ”
Yale’s little joke on the name of the
lately-deceased politician Graves was not the only
one the latter had to suffer. When Victoria
reduced the number of its M’s.L.A., Delatite
(represented by Graves) and Anglesey (by Hunt)
were thrown into one. There was an argument
in the House as to the name of the new district.
Graves was going strong for “Delatite,” when
the usually morose Hunt interjected : “As the
hon. member intends opposing me, the electorate
had better be called ‘ Gravesend.’ ”
In the N.S.W. Assembly of politicians,
police-court lawyers, barbers, etc., “Danny”
Levy the other night received the retort confound-
ing just when he was about to pass a vote of con-
fidence in his own repartee :
Mr. Levy: I wish to say that as far as the law relating
to Sunday closing is concerned, if the Government will
bring down to this House a Bill providing for the opening
on Sundays of shops in which fruit and soft drinks
An hon. member : And pawnshops !
Mr. Levy : I think the hon. member has been in a pawn-
shop more times than I have.
Mr. J. Storey ; But the hon. member defends the people
when they get into trouble.
Mr. Levy ; I have defended many friends of the hon.
member.
Mr. J. Storey : And they are all in gaol.
Then Daniel changed the subject.

Most Attorneys-General, nowadays, are
men who have pursued the horsehair as an
afterthought, so to speak, and usually haven’t
pursued it for very long, either. “ Bill ” Denny,
who has had to handle the legal end of the carters’
strike business in Adelaide, pushed a pen through
a newspaper before Kingston encouraged him to
study law ; and he was one of the latest enrolled
when he became leader of the Bar in a purely
technical way. Hughes and Holman had had a
bit more experience than Denny ; but, so far as is
known, Drysdale Brown, of Victoria, had never
practised at all when he got his job; while Nanson,
of Westralia, had appeared in one case—passed on
to him, by the way, by another pressman turned
lawyer.
“Oof”: The average widow leads a
lonely, drab existence, full of care and boarders.
She is a human back-number bound in black, and
Sorrow has hit her so hard that she doesn-’t care
which eye her bonnet is over. There are plenty
of cheerful grass-widows ; but the merry widow
of the plain or untrimmed variety has never been
produced anywhere but on the stage—she is
merely the gay, quaint fiction of an inventive
librettist. Agreeable excitement is the thing for
which widows hunger most—something that will
take their minds off tram fares and tenants and
bank shares and boarders. Scandal, religion, gib,
relatives, hard work and travel help the widow a
lot; but there is still a great blank left. There is
a fortune waiting for the author of a really bright
text-book, “How to be a Merry Widow, or
Romps fdr Relicts.” Meanwhile the widow is
left to seek or invent diversion for herself. One
of her, at Bendigo (Vic.), recently took up larceny
as a hobby, and kept the police guessing hard,
until a patient Hop secreted h,.usi ,■ and his feet
behind a trellis at the rear of a grocer’s shop.
From his place of concealment lie mw the lady get
over the fence, enter the shop, and emerge with
some onions which she didn’t want. After she
had been conveyed to the lockup, a search was
made of her house, which was found to be strewn
with much other stolen property which she didn’t
want, including bedding and furniture. The
bereaved one was not hard up, and Bendigo is
busy asking itself why she started out as a land
pirate. So far no one has been able to- suggest
any reason except that excitement was scarce.
From a circular lately issued at Singa-
pore :
I beg herewith to notify the public of the Straits
Settlements and the F.M.S. that it is my intention at an
early date to publish at Singapore a weekly “Sporting,
Social and Critical Journal”—a newspaper to be at once
Clean, Healthy, Critical and Just.
Jn this journal the oppressed shall be vindicated.
Clique and Coterie, who toil in cellars against the in-
terests of the public who pervert (for Gain) a pure flow
of national sporting life, shall be mercilessly unearthed
from their barren burrows and be scathingly scalded and
scorched and scotched before the searching eye of Public
Opinion. The Monopolists and the Privileged Few who
get rich against the right and interest of the many shall
receive from this publication its final quietus.
To conduct such a journal I may, with privileged pride,
say at once the work, although fairly stupendous, is not
beyond my ability. I have m ringed, owned or con-
trolled several important newspapers in Australia. I,
therefore, do not, I trust, come before the public with
the proposition as a novice. The peoples of these great
States require such a paper. lam prepared to supply the
demand. All I ask in return is Public Support, Public
Sympathy and Public Confidence.
And the Regenerator of “the East”? No other
than W. N. Willis, Australia’s old friend of the

HEALTH TO CUTICURA
“Well over four years ago my two
little girls were taken with a dreadful
*•>»
fja©'
scalp trouble that
the doctors called
ringworm. They
attended the
Hospital as ®ut-
patients for a
year. I had to
apply their oint-
ment with a
brush, giving the
children frightful
.... . pain. I also had
to have their head* shared every two
weeks, but they got no better under the
treatment. They used to cry with the
tormenting itching, and their heads
were covered with a thick scurf and
dandruff.
“Abeut a year ago I determined to
try the ©uticura Remedies. I used
plenty of Guticura Soap and applied
the Guticura Ointment. I used only
about three cakes of Cutieura Soap and
three bexes of Cutioura Ointment and
they wore cured. Their hair is growing
long and nice again. They had become
so ill after their three years of suffering
that 1 had to send on# away to a con-
valescents’ home as soon as she was
cured, but now she is home, well and
ntrong. My younger girl was away from
scheel nine months with the disease. I
am very grateful to tfuticura and for
their children’s sake I hope other
mothers will try it. The Guticura Soap
I will always us# for it makes the hair
bo lovely. Mrs. Nora Emmott, 38, Lena

ANTINEURASTHIN
& NERVOUS
BREAKDOWN
In nervous breakdown the brain and nerve cells must
be FED, and not stimulated by medicines in the form of
tonics or sedatives, which give temporary relief, but
cannot effect permanent improvement.
Lecithin is the ONLY substance by which the brain and
nerves can be nourished ; and it is Lecithin which the sys-
tem requires in all cases of neurasthenic conditions
(Nervous disorders, Dyspepsia, Neuralgia, Brain-Fag,
Insomnia, Depression, Insanity, etc.). If the brain and
nerves can be supplied sufficiently with Lecithin, the cure
is certain ; Antineurasthin s upplies that substance and
effects the cure.
ANTINEURASTHIN is the ONLY known preparation
containing an effective percentage of Lecithin in an
active organic state ; completely assimilable, and with its
valuable principles undiminished in any way.
A sample of Antineurasthin, together with a valuable
treatise on Nervous Disorders, will be despatched by
return mail by the wholesale distributor for Australia anil
New Zealand, H. A. Goddard, Eagle Street, Brisbane, on
receipt of ninepence in stamps. [2

The old argument as to how much notice an editor is

Perth, where the steersman of the Mirror (weekly) was
offered one week in which to gather up his hat and get.

putting the matter to the Law, Judge ltOoth decided
that three months was a fair thing. Verdict for the

“Scribe”: John Madden, Chief Justice, has come out
with some genialities at the Melbourne Yoriek Club.
Only a few of the oldest remember that he was the club’s
secretary about the time that his ambition soared no
higher than the humble billet of librarian at the local
University. Madden, on this recent evening, recalled
such Yorickians as Marcus Clarke, Kendall, Gordon,
Charles Bright, Walstab and so forth. After the days of
those men the club went down—it first let in the men
with slight pretentions, and then those with none at all,
and the dull, barren, moneyed people choked it. So
there has been a Yoriek opposition, called the Savages,
whose watch' word has been : “Let the plutocrats stick to
their Athenaeum.”

W. B. Withers, the ancient historian of Ballarat, nowa-
days living at Dulwicli Hill (N.S.W.), drops this note re
the beginning of the Ballarat Mechanics’ Institute: “I
see some Bulletin correspondents have been writing
about W. H. Batten, who was first salaried secretary of the
Ballarat Mechanics’ Institute, and held the office till he
died, after 50 years’ service. It was my fortune to have
known Mr. Batten in Melbourne before he had moved to
Ballarat, and after my first visit to Ballarat, a little before
the first rush to Creswiek. My second visit to Ballarat
was in 1855, and there I again made Batten’s acquaint-
ance, and we both, vvith Cooper and a few others, took
part in starting the Institute. I voted for Batten as
first secretary. Cooper married a Ballarat lady, an expert
penwoman ; they left Ballarat for Portland, and there
started or bought the Portland Guardian. After Cooper’s
death his widow married Andrew Semple, one of the
Argus leader-writers. They are both dead now."

“The Snake”: Accounts from London concerning the
recent conference of journalists contain reference to a
matter that has roused my curiosity frequently. R.
McMillan (of Sydney) and all the rest of tile conference
were one day entertained at lunch in the Royal Gallery
of the House of Lords, and during “smoke-o” the
acting-Mayorof London recalled the excitement of 1771,
“when a mayor and alderman had been imprisoned in the
Tower for daring to publish the doings of Parliament.”
It’s a fairly long story, but it’s worth hearing. Prior to
1771, it was generally understood that publication of the
Parliamentary debates was a breach of privilege ; never-
theless, a few printers risked it, giving fictitious names
to the speakers, or, perhaps, their initials. In 1771, one
member of the Commons complained that he had been
misrepresented by one of the sheets, and then the row
started. A motion was passed ordering the printers to
attend the House, but the inky persons told the House
to get work, and went on sweating at the handle of the
press. Then the House instructed the Sergeant-at-arms
to arrest the offenders ; but even more disrespectful lan-
guage was used to him. Public opinion was so strongly
behind the printers that the Commons, seeing no other
way, appealed to George 111. to issue a proclamation offer-
ing a reward for the apprehension of the paper-men. The
reward wasoffered, and the arrest followed; but the House
tripped over its doorstep once more, because the arrested
men on being brought before the magistrates (three, in
separate Courts) were immediately discharged. Just here
my information is at variance with that of the Acting
Gaud Mayor of London. He said that a mayor and aider-
man were two of the printers and were imprisoned in the
Tower for publishing the speeches. That is wrong.
The Mayor and the alderman were two of the
magistrates who discharged the printers, and both
were members of Parliament. They, with the third
magistrate, also an M.P., were thanked by the citizens in
public meeting, but were called upon by the Commons to
line up and be dealt with. Crosby (the Mayor) and Oliver
(alderman) attended, and, after argument, were bustled
to the Tower, where they were kept for the remainder of
j the session. Wilkes (the third magistrate and member)
refused to attend at any bar except Bellamy’s; he
j claimed his member’s right and privilege, and declined to
obey the House in any other character. As the House
couldn’t force him, it had to throw in the mace, and this
is how it was done. Wilkes was ordered ta toe the
scratch on April 8, and then the House adjourned until
April 9. That settled the question of reporting the de-
bates, and from that time there was, practically, freedom to
the angels who perch above the bald head of the Speaker.

“ L.” : In the middle of the crude, stagey display made
by the Maoris in the “Maori Village,” now' on exhibi-
tion, there is a strange weirdness in the singing by the
troupe of rare old Ben’s rare old song, “ Drink to me
only.” The one thing immutable in the world seems to
be a fine bit of poetry. Old Ben Jonson thought like a
scholar, drank like a gentleman, and loved like a poet;
and the result is that centuries after he goes under his
slab of stone, his lyric is crooned by a race of now more
or less civilised savages of whom he never dreamed. The
Maori men and girls are more natural in their own harsh
music; but, all the same, their tribute to Ben Jonson
ought to make his old skeleton feel happy in the tomb.

The worm will turn ; and at last even the pressmen of
Tasmania form an “ association to conserve the interests
of newspaper writers and artists.” Up till now the stan-
dard of pay for the newspaper men’s very diverse work
has been fixed by the proprietors, in accordance with the
blessed law of supply and demand—a law which always
pans out badly for the little fellow who has to ask a
bigger fellow’s leave to toil. That the men who supply a
large share of the brains required to keep the big news
factories going are now’ thinking seriously of demanding
a say in the matter of the wage-standard will doubtless
cause great indignation in certain quarters. In fact, no
one need be surprised if it causes consternation.
DAIRY DREAMS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The frantic writer tore his hair
And pulled it out in tangled lumps,
And thrashed about his private lair
Like some wild person with the jumps ;
His eye was bright, his teeth were long
And clashed upon all kinds of curse—
He wrestled with a Summer Song,
And Oow was tangled in his verse.
Nearby there was a dairy, where
Fat cattle nosed among the maize ;
Cow snnffed the sweet, suburban air
Throughout the long, warm, well-fed daj's ;
All day Cow bellowed, mooed and moaned ;
Cow snorted when the moon was bright,
And Cow incessantly intoned
Her praise of guzzle, noon and night.
The manufacturer of stuff
That should mean immortality,
Caught up his pen. “No more—enough !’*
He wrote. “No joy for you and me j ”
“No moar! ” intoned some wailing cow,
And chewed upon the thought awhile....
“ 800-moom! ” The writer smote his brow,
And cursed in language really vile.
“ Moof /" did the fatted cow remark
With heavy pathos in her voice?
It was, to him, a simple nark—
He failed in Nature to rejoice,
And to be glad that Cow was nigh,
While he was wrestling with his muse ;
Cow did not bring the Seeing Eye,
Nor with Romance his toil infuse.
Instead, brown words with purple backs
Rose to his lips when “ 800 ! ” came by
Upon the breeze ; he left the tracks
Whereon he chased the butterfly
Of poesy, and—well, indeed,
The Muse is coy and hard to please
When Cow, packed tight with good, green feed,
Breaks in on writers’ ecstasies.

THIS Company is being projected for the purpose
of acquiring from the vendors and working for
quicksilver, in terms of the agreement above
referred to, their right, title and interest in four
mineral search licenses (comprising four square miles, or
2560 acres, of ground) held from the South Australian
Government, and situated near Willunga, South Aus-
tralia.
Quicksilver has been known to exist upon these pro-
perties for years past, but no prolonged scientific investi-
gation of the workings, outcrops and geological
formation has been attempted until Mr. A. G. Holroyd,
mineralogist and metallurgist, of Melbourne, was deputed
b3' a Melbourne Syndicate, some three months ago, to
make a proper inspection and tests, in order to first
prove the existence of mercury in profitable commercial
quantities.
The proposal is, after developing the tunnels further
and sinking, also proving the mercury values by means
of steam puddlers, to eventually form one large company,
either in the States or London, in order to procure the
necessary capital to erect treatment plant, and carry on
the operations upon a large scale.
Report on the Willunga Quicksilver Mines, Willunga,
S.A., by Arthur G. Holroyd, metallurgist, Melbourne,
October 24, 1910 :
DESCRIPTION OF PROPERTIES.
The plan locates the tunnel No. 1 on Block 11,815.
The entrance to this tunnel is about 70 yards to the east
of a permanent running creek (the Meadows Creek), and
runs into a steep hill for a distance of about 300 ft. The
lode runs practically north and south, but shows little or
any outcrop. The lode consists of schists, claystone,
sandstones and gneissic granite, and when freshly broken
shows native quicksilver from one end to the other. The
graphite clays evidently with the sandstones, showing
the best native mercury, being the most porous.
The mercury occurring in these clays, and softer de-
composed rocks, including the granite, is not visible to
the naked eye until the ground is freshly broken and left
to sweat, and then, upon examination, the globules of
finely-divided quicksilver have agglomerated and are
plainly visible. The underlay of the lode is to the east,
and a winze sunk at the end of the tunnel would cut all
the veins dipping into the hill. Ventilation could also
be secured by sinking a shaft to cut this winze from the
side of the hill above the tunnel; the depth roughly
would be about 50ft. from above, and as a test this
tunnel could be stripped on both sides and enlarged, and
the ore extracted could be tested for values by concen-
tration. By sinking the winze the veins could be tapped
and examined as passed through, and would eventually
prove whether cinnabar occurred. It is impossible to
say at what depth cinnabar would be found. As the
rock is so decomposed I would not expect to find
cinnabar at the present level. I found, however, what
appeared to me the true vermilion stains of mercury,
most likely an oxide. I also found what I consider
crystals of calomel —a subchloride of mercury.
It was impossible for me to test the values of this
tunnel, and this could not be done without bulk tests
being made on the spot. I, however, secured over 11b.
weight of native quicksilver by rough panning without
crushing the ore, only sluicing it in the dish by hand.
Its width is undetermined, but the tunnel runs in 261 ft.,
and still in lode matter. I consider that if this lode were
treated in bulk, even if it only carried a very small
quantity of mercury, it would pay well, as it is in a
position for working easily and cheaply, and no great
difficulty would occur in saving a good percentage by
disentegrating the clays and concentrating. Its position
as regards the water in the creek alone makes it a most
valuable property. You will notice that in securing
Russell’s Block you have to the north another mile of
this creek, and water will be wanted for concentrating
purposes. Later on, provided the values and prospects
are good, this creek would be used for water power by
damming. As regards No. 1 tunnel, it carries a quantity
of native mercury, finely decimated throughout the
clay, sandstone and schist, and will eventually yield a
large quantity when treated in bulk. I feel confident
that sulphide of mercury (cinnabar) will be found at a
depth, but at the present cannot estimate or theorise
how far we have to go.
TREATMENT OF THE ORE.
As regards the treatment of the ore, it could be easily
concentrated. The question of the crushing will require
experiment If a ball mill could be used, and the clays
would not clog the screens, it would make a good crusher
for this class of ore ; but something more practical may
be found. All the ore containing native mercury must
be treated locally. For future operations, if cinnabar be
found, a deposit of limestone must be located or brought
to the port of Aldinga, and a plant could be erected in a
suitable vicinity for retorting. A puddler in the mean-
while, with ripple tables, might be used to dissolve the
clays, and the harder sandstones could afterwards be
crushed, if found rich enough, and then concentrated.
SOAPEY’S TUNNEL.
Soapey’s Tunnel lies in Thomas’s search area, about
seven chains to the south of the boundary of the 200-acre
block. There is a big schistose outcrop running north
and south, marked on the plan. This lode evidently runs
right through the 200 acres up to the northern boundary
fence, and into Russell’s Block. In my opinion, after the
test I have made, other gentlemen who have examined
these properties did not give sufficient time to their in-
vestigations, and did notallow the ground in these tun-
nels sufficient time to sweat in order to see the quick-
silver in larger quantities. I have myself collected quick-
silver in a spoon after leaving this tunnel for a few hours,
and not allowing anyone to enter it.
There are two more big schistose outcrops, all running
north and south, parallel, and totally unproved, so that,
in securing the four blocks, you have secured valuable
properties.
Extracts from letter from Mr. A. 6. Holroyd, dated
Willunga, November 24 :
Am forwarding you to-day more samples, also a lot of
quicksilver panned off by myself, and thoroughly washed
by hand without crushing. Both tunnels, as I informed
you before by wire, are looking splendid, and we have
more than enough to work on immediately.
I feel confident that I can produce quicksilver from
this district by the cwt. It is evidently distributed over
a very large area. The hills in this district are auri-
ferousj and it is the most ideal spot for mining I have
seen in all my career. Naturally, there are certain diffi-
culties to be overcome in the way of transport, but they
are so slight to my mind compared to other mining dis-
tricts that I have visited that I have no fear of making
this venture a success. The properties that we hold
under search area contain some very big lodes that have
never been tested at all, and these lodes cannot be tested
without the expenditure of a fair amount of money. But,
to repeat, we have enough ground to work upon with the
original tunnels that have been opened up. The tunnels
are fit for anyone to inspect who has any knowledge of
quicksilver. If the business portion is properly con-
ducted, all those interested can feel quite safe.

The Breaking of Blue Billy.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
TTTE watched the fires blazing under
V Y the billies while Hayes told us how he
* " did it, for Blue Billy was the most
notorious horse up our way.
“You see, Blue Billy was known to us chaps
from the time’e fust appeared among the brumbies'
as a foal, an’ even then he ’ad a wild eye an’ a pair
of legs what showed what ’e promised ter become.
’ls sire was a racer what got loose fer a week or
two ; but ’e got ’is temper from is dam, an’ a damn
bad one too. ’ ’
Billy stopped for us to laugh; then he pro-
ceeded a little discontentedly. “It was on’y be
accident we got ini inter the yard, where the
fence was nine foot ’igh, an’ a rail ter every foot.
Fer all that’e tried ter jump it; but’e’it the top
rail with a smack what sent im onter ’is back,
where ’e lay dreamin’ fer a minnut. When ’e
woke up a ’alter was on ’im, an’ ’e started careerin’
round Jim ’Adley there.”
Bill nodded friendly-wise towards Jim, who
grunted.
“ lie was lookin’ at ’im with a vicious, wait-a-
bit sort o’look, which made Jim an’us uncom-
fortable” (Jim glanced up quickly), “an’ we was
glad-like we wasn’t Jim.” (Jim looked down
again.) “ But when we tried ter put the saddle
on ’im there was a fuss. Blue Billy’s legs was
like Hashes o’ lightnin’, an’’is ears was hat back
on ’is neck, suggestin’ ugly things with ’is teeth.”
We smiled. All except Tomplin who listened,
his eyes staring with absorbed'interest. Hayes
gradually singled him out for the story. He liked
an interested listener.
“ We ran the ’orse round till we reeled, but ’e
never seemed ter tire. Jim stuck ter’im like a
man, but it was too much ter expect, an’ at last’e
’ad ter let go. A second time Blue Billy tried ter
jump the fence, an’ a second time ’e lay on ’is
back wonderin’at the stars coinin’ in daylight.
But when ’e got up this time I ’ad the saddle on
’im, not troublin’ about the bridle. That
’orse took me fer a circus pole, never even
Jettin’ me stroke ’is nose. Then he began ter back
till ’is tail ’it the fence, ’an ’e sprang forward as
if it ’ad kicked ’im there. I thought o’ somethin’
after’e did it a dozen times, an’the thirteenth
time, as ’e sprang forward, I leaped an’ landed
fair in the saddle. Then there was a scatter, the
fellers was on the fence like crows waitin’ fer me
ter die. Blue Billy stood ruminatin’-like, an’ I
felt the devil begin to make ’im shake, a devil
that went along ’is muscles like ’tricity ’long a
wire, an’ ’e shook from ’ock to forelock. Then I
thought the sky was suddenly cornin’ onter me
head ; then that the earth was shovin’ ’im up ter
split me in two; an’'e landed on’is feet with a
jar that nearly jarred me ’ead off. It made my
backbone ache fer a week after. Then the yard
flew round till the fences was streaks an’ all the
earth a whirlin’ circle with us in the centre, while
the fellers on the fence was ten times as wide as
they ought ter be.
“Suudenly ’estopped, an’began ter think agen.
’ 111 ’ad got over the tremblin’, but I could feel the
devil was still tinglin’ in ’im by the tingle in me,
an’ jes’ as the world was beginnin’ ter look
familiar-like agen, it suddenly began ter wave—
first ter one side, then ter the other, formin’ long
loops like streams o’ wires a mob o’ cattle has
stampeded through ; up an’ down, round an’ back
agen nohow, me ead feelin’ like as it was on a
neck a mile long, an’ not long enough then to
take in all the sinosities o’ that immortal buck.
Still, I ’ung ter’im like a blister; I never quite
knoo ’ow, fer it was the 1110s’ ’strordinary buck I
ever sat— l 6 ways all at onct, an’ every way dif-
ferent. I’eard the fellers shoutin’ter me to get
off. I even ’card a dog bark. The dus’ was
about me in a suffocatin’ cloud, through which the
dog went sudden-like, and ended ’is life lookin’
ter me like a valler streak as e flew through th’
dust, an’ I ’eard ’1 in barkin’ no more. Then I
come down—-found myself sittin’ with me back
ter the fence, with Blue Billy on ’is ’aunches
starin’ at me surprised-like; which was nothin’
ter my surprise when I found meself sittin’
on the saddle still an’ the girths unbroken.
’E’ ’ad bucked ’imself clear out through the girth
backwards, turnin’ me a twistin’ some’sault —an’
there we was lookin’ at each other. One of the
chaps turned a sorter pea-green, an’ sayin’ that
was no ’orse, got down from the fence and went
away solemn-like. But I was mad; that ’orse was
like ter ruin me reputat.on. Before ’e got over
’is surprise I was up and grabbed ’im. ’E
bumped back inter the fence, then I was on ’im
again in the jump, bare-backed.”
Jim Hadley rose and walked sorrowfully to
his tent. He even forgot his billy of tea. Bill
Hayes went on in an awed voice, and Tomplin’s
eyes looked as if they would drop out in another
minute.
“Blue Billy thought ’ard this time, then guv a
sudden leap, which slipped me back on ’is flanks,
and made straight fer the nine-foot fence. I saw
’is game, instanter. ’E would try an’ leap the
fence, an’ failin’, fall back and kill me. ’ls chest
bumped, I slewed aside, an’ me momentum
carried me round. Down ’e went on’is back,
an’ I was sittin’ on ’is belly, waitin’ till ’e’d
done countin’ the stars. ’E must ’a’ took me fer
a snake, fer’e wriggled up sudden like. I wriggled
too, an’ when ’e was standin’ up I was sittin’ on
’is back agen. ’E squealed with rage, an’ threw
’imself on ’is back ter roll on me ; but as ’e fell I
slid round ’is carcase, all the time on top no
matter which side o’ ’im was uppermost. Thon’e
tried every trick a ’orse knows ter lull a man, from
scrapin’ ’im be the fence, ter bitin’ an’ kickin’ an’
' rollin’ on ’im. It was no go, though I was as giddy
as if I’d bin slewed round at a hundred turns a
second, an’ the sweat was pourin' outer me till I
Was wet as a’ot bath, an’ ’e wos in a lather o’ foam.
’ls breath was beginnin’ ter come ’ard, an’ I
could feel ’e was beginnin’ ter recognise as ’ow 'e’d
found’is master. I shouted for’em ter open the
| gate, an’ out we shot, ’im buckin’ at every stride,
ft was ’is last ’ope, an’ ’e made the most of it; but
I knew all ’is games by now, an’ each buck was
feebler than the last. In another ’alf hour ’e
cantered back ter the yard—tame.”
We all reached for our billies except Tomplin.
He drew in a deep sigh like a sucking pump. We
looked at him in alarm, except Bill Hayes, who
poured some tea into the lid of his billy to cool it.
“It was wonderful,” said Tomplin. “It re-
minds me of a ’orse exactly like Billy I once got
on.” Bill put down his tea and stared threaten-
ingly at Tomplin. Each man stood in the atti-
tude the remarjc caught him, and stared at
Tomplin too, expectantly, almost apprehensively.
“Did yer ride ’ini’?” asked Bill, in a tone of
gudden death.
“ I fell off,” answered Tomplin.
Bill drank his tea suddenly and burnt his throat,
which made him swear. Then he went into his
tent. Tomplin said in a whisper that he did ride
that horse, and if he had had his brother there to
help him he would have told Hayes so.
W. BRENTA.
Premier Hurry’s bowdlerised Land Tax
Bill came before the Fat Landlords of Victoria at
the committee stage the other evening. Being a
momentous measure, the House of Review
naturally gave it deep consideration—for quite 10
minutes. Then, after making a single “sugges-
tion” that an assessor who wilfully makes an
incorrect valuation (a thing almost impossible to
prove) should be liable to 12 months’ gaol instead
of £lOO fine—the Big Landlords accepted the tax
almost cheerfully. Even in their most complacent
moments they hadn’t hoped for a ha’penny tax
all round with a £250 exemption. The flat rate
will naturally hit the small landowner harder
than the big one, and the Tories saw therein a
chance to use land taxation against the Labor
party. So they accepted it joyfully as a very
small curse with a very large blessing concealed
in its tail.
“ Book ware ” tells of his annoyance :
The authorised biog. of Cecil Rhodes, in two vols., is
published—the work of one Mitchell. A reader pounces
at once on the Jameson Raid. It is explained, or rather
befogged, at length. We keep asking two questions:
Was Chamberlain aware of the raid beforehand? Was it
hidden from Chamberlain, but known to other English
authorities? On these points Mitchell is baffling and
annoying. Either he won’t tell, or he doesn’t know. So
we have a heap of mush about Rhodes's complicity.
He was in it, up to the hilt, the very Mephis-
topheles, the designer. But we knew all that. He
said as much himself. The author professes to ex-
plain the London Commission of Inquiry ; yet here again
he evades the hub. This is bound up in a batch of letters
called the Hawksley Correspondence. The Commission
demanded them. The Colonial Office refused them, and
they have never been published. We expect the real
biographer to clear this up. The Colonial Office so far
keeps its fist closed, so what is the good of the bio-
graphy? We must wait for the real thing till the
Hawksley letters are exposed to the light of day. The
present author only makes darkness visible.
Teesdale Smith, the jarrah boss of West-
ralia, feasted the Fatmen of his State the other
evening, and gave them a chance to curse the
coming referenda. Premier Wilson intimated
that “if they carefully considered the question
they would come to the conclusion that they could
not brook that wholesale interference with in-
dustrial matters which was proposed by the
central Federal authority.” It is coming ba,ck to
the old question —the right of every man to
wallop his own nigger. Still, the Westralian who
howls for that right is something extra in the way
of a fool. The main object of the referendum
proposals is to stop one or more States, which
happen to be over-run by sweaters, from getting
or keeping an unfair low-wage advantage over
other States which pay decent wages. Tasmania,
for instance, is a low-wage State ; and, so long as
there isn’t Federal control of industry, its sweated
timber industry is always liable to compete
unfairly with the high-wage timber industry of
Westralia, and depress the profits of Smith.
The old fogies of the N.S.W. Council fell
in with a splash on the last evening of the session.
When the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Bill was
being revised, the Lords amended it so that 10
per cent, interest should be collected on all over-
due instalments. The Labor Government pro-
posed to accept the amendment rather than lose
the Bill. Then it suddenly smote Wade that his
party would have to carry the odium ; whereupon
he arose hastily and barked at the heels of the
Council. The Labor Ministry, which is obviously
collecting material to justify the abolition of the
Council, sat and smiled while the Opposition
raved. Wade said the amendment was altogether
too drastic. Price said the 10 per cent, was a
millstone. Gillies said the charge should never
exceed 5 per cent. Fitzpatrick said it was pre-
posterous. Perry said it was an outrage. Colonel
Onslow said it was—er —monstrous. So it went
on till the Council realised that it had played into
the hands of its executioner, and hurriedly
accepted 4 per cent, instead of 10. Whereupon
Wade went home feeling that he had escaped a
gin by the skin of his teeth.
The incredible bumptiousness of the
occasional English person is evidenced in the case
of a patent medicine firm which has been making
money out of Australia by selling a more or less
useless substance in a bottle. The Australian
Commerce Act requires that the description of
imported goods, including more or less useless slush
in bottles, must be at least reasonably accurate,
and the attention of this firm has been drawn to
the fact that its description is, to some extent,
blazing rot. Whereupon, it has replied (1) that
the Australian authority who wants to have goods
honestly described is a lunatic ; (2) that it declines
to pay any attention to Australian law and will
carry the question to an English Court, which the
firm, in the innocence of its soul, evidently thinks
can overrule any Australian statute ; and (3) that
it will “ retaliate by refusing to invest capital” in
Australia. So far as is known it never invested
any money here, but simply took money out of
Australia; so its threat isn’t so very dreadful after
all. But the attitude of the firm is strictly
English. Nothing could be more English.

Forest Devil.
HOW A LADY WORKED
THE “DEVIL.”
Messrs. J. COOPER & SONS,
Melbourne.
PANTON HILL,
17th October, 1910.
Dear Sirs,—Just a few lines to let you know how we are getting along with the Bunyip
Forest Devil father bought from you three weeks ago. Father says it is the BEST
MACHINE HE HAS EVER USED, and he has seen and used a good many, and is very
pleased with it. I must let you know a little what we have done with it. Our trees are
mostly white gum, box, and messmate. We have uprooted trees that were 4ft. 6in. in
diameter, or so thick that the anchor rope was just big enough to go round them, with only
father and myself on the lever. There was one giant that, when I said to pull it, father
seemed very doubtful, and told me to wait until my brothers came home from school; but I
said, Put the ropes on ” ; and both of us got on the lever, and, in a short time, out came the
monster with roots in the air, and made a hole not less than sft. deep and 12ft. wide. We
had not seen a tree pulled like it. Father would not have the hole filled up, but lets it stop
there so people can see WHAT A POWERFUL MACHINE THE “ BUNYIP” IS. I
have PULLED TREES MYSELF, about 2ft. in diameter, without any help. Some of our
trees are dead about'five years, and the roots are mostly green, and bring up a great lot of
soil, but it is all the same. THE GREEN ONES COME OUT JUST AS EASY AS THE
DEAD ONES. There is NO STOPPING when once the “ Devil” catches hold of them —
THEY HAVE TO COME WITH THE BUNYIP. Wishing you every success in the
future, yours truly, (Signed) MARIA NOTSCHALL.

Biliousness 8 Sick Headaches
DURING the festive season the good fare often tempts
one to excessive eating, which results in a sharp
bilious attack, sick headache or indigestion.
Because Bile Beans act directly by aiding digestion
and regulating the flow of bile from the liver, they are the
ideal and indispensable medicine for this season. Bile
Beans, being of purely vegetable origin, do not gripe or
weaken like fifty-year-old-mineral pills, but bring to the
stomach and liver just that natural assistance which is
necessary for the restoration of good health and appetite.
Mrs. J. Day. of 122 Lord Street, Burnley, Melbourne,
says i— “ Severe attacks of biliousness and Indigestion
made me very miserable. These bouts brought on an
accumulation of wind, which would press up against my
heart, and almost stop It beating. The pain was so
Intense / could scarcely breathe. Between the shoulders
I would also have terrible pain, like the thrust of a knife.
At times the biliousness would be so distressing that /
would be prostrated for days, my system being racked
by vomiting and straining, giving me a very bad time
indeed. Of all the many remedies / took in my endeavor
to get relief, none were successful until / commenced
taking Bile Beans. This splendid medicine soon made a
grand change for the better. After a course of Bile Beans
the Indigestion and biliousness were ended, and those
painful attacks are things of the past.”
The STANDARD FAMILY MEDICINE
Bile Beans are un-
rivalled as a family
medicine. They are
mild in action, and
suitable for young and
old of both sexes. Bile
Beans are specially
valuable for liver
trouble, constipation,
biliousness, Indiges-
tion, headache, bad
breath, debility, sick-
ness, loss of energy
and bad blood. Sold

stores. is. l£d. and

Matchless for the Complexion,
A Dream of Paradise.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The death is reported of Mr. Charles Clunies-Ross,
“ King ” of the Cocos and Keeling Islands. — Mews item.
I DREAMED a dream of Paradise, where
Wade’s discordant yell
Was faintly heard—but far away, like a
* cracked chapel bell;
Far off from coves who legislate, emitting verbal
steam,
I was a king and ruled in state —it was a bosh ter
dream !
No Argus and no Telegraph, no Herald and no
Age
Were printed there—and Anti-Sosh flung not its
battle-gage !
It was a Vision Beautiful that came by night to
me,
When I in heathen nakedness sat by the purple
sea !
Now, who would be an Emperor like sleepless
Kaiser Bill,
Who owned an isle in heathendom and ruled it at
his will ?
No papers there, nor cablegrams—whose everlast-
ing lies
Like spooks of old Mendacity each tiresome morn-
ing rise !
No churches and no aldermen, no bishops or
M.P.’s—
Within my dream’s magnificence there were no
pests like these !
I was an Island Emperor, and bathed at dusk and
dawn
In green lagoons where no Joe Wards went bound-
ing towards the Pawn.
[ owned an isle whose swaying palms no screech-
ful Judkins knew;
No Peter Bowling howled at large—no Cook
obscured the view ;
1 was a king in heathendom —yea, far away from
all
State-Frighting coves and nasty beasts that groan
and yowl and squall !
I had no pomp nor circumstance—just seven-and-
forty wives,
And jabbed each nagging ma-in-law with large,
assorted knives !
I had, amongst those odalisques, one special
Queen of Queens —
Dear Solonaima ’neath the palms whilst Sarah
cooked the beans !
I was a bos liter emperor, but not of Germanee—
To boss the gentle cannibal was joy enough for
me!
I did not ask the universe to tremble at my
sneeze—
My Cocos realm was filled with bliss, set round
with purple seas !
From me the smirkful catechist in haste and
anguish fled —
We boiled each ancient missioner, and thus the
light was spread.
And oft a favored editor with me would spend a
year,
And quaff long drinks ; ’twas PARADISE beside
the ocean’s cheer !
VICTORIA.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
HOW’S things ? ” queried Carter, and
Klisson, new to the game, responded
cheerfully, “ Oh, fairly rotten.”
Out by the Edge of Things men are not too par-
ticular in their speech, and when Klisson came to
look at the flat monotony of his first camel-trip it
did seem as he had said. But the newness and
utter strangeness had made him qualify the
rottenness of his circumstances.
Carter, looking at the skin, already the color of
well-cured bacon rind, and the little “draw”
that was coming to the eyelids as a love token
from a too ardent sun, grinned. “ But you
wouldn’t give it up ! ” he said.
Klisson admitted that he would not—admitted
it in a voice that had not yet reached the rippling
monotones of the men of the silent places.
Carter’s had though. For ten years had
Carter been taking camels into the interior of
Australia. He was on his way down to meet a
loaded traimnow “ packing light ’’—only a couple
of camels and one driver with him. Kiisson was
going inland.
“ Your chap’s been in the army ! ” Carter told
the newer hand. "Look at his shoulders, an’
his walk, an' the general swing o’ the beggar.”
The two drivers, stalwart Afghans both, were
watbhing a big bull camel that was heavily
chained. He was not good to watch, for he was
in a tearing and his screams split the air.
Carter spoke severely about the bull camel.
“I’ll have to shoot the brute,” he said. “I
think it’s goin mad, but Shaptazh Khan keeps
sayin’ to wait an’ wait.”
“ Is it love-mad, think you?” queried Abdullah,
Klisson’s Afghan, of its owner as the two white
men joined them.
“ Best not insult him with thy mangy cows,”
Shaptazh threw in quickly, and Klisson scowled.
“You give your beggar plenty of rope,” he
grumbled to Carter under breath as they surveyed
the angry brute.
“So’ll you when you get a good man,” laughed
Carter. Then to his driver: “Well, what d’ye
think now, Shaptazh ? Is it temper or mad-
ness ? ”
“ Madness I think, though in truth I know not.
We will give him till sunrise. Quiet, thou !
this to the straining animal tearing at his hobbles.
“ Art thou a surra-struck son of a pig that thou
tearest at thyself so? Quiet, O Lord of the
Desert that forgettest himself!”
Presently the darkness came down like a grey
blanket as the sun slipped under the western
hummocks. And the great camel’s screams tore
holes through the softness of the blanket.
“Wish you’d shoot that thing now, or I’ll be
sorry for all the sleep we’ll get to-night,” said
Klisson as they sat and smoked and listened.
The Afghans were swapping yarns in their own
tongue, of which Carter understood enough to
catch the drift of their talk. Abdullah was tell-
ing of, a brute that had killed two men of the
commissariat department when he was in the
army.
Carter looked at him curiously, for his accent
was precisely the same as Shaptazh Khan’s.
“You two are of the same district?” he asked
suddenly.
Shaptazh nodded, his sombre eyes staring into
the fire. “We are of the hills by the Gilgai
Cut,’’ he said, “ but we do not know each other.
Thou art much like one Mir Ullah, who also
served in the army.”
Carter saw the glint of his eyeballs as he turned
thorn on Abdullah.
Abdullah shook his head.* “I never met such
a o.ne,” he answered. “There are doubtless as
many Mir Ullahs as Abdullahsin the great army.”
“ Yes ! Shaptazh assented. “We do not use
manj T new names. I should have liked to meet
that Mir Ullah you are so like though. I owe
him a heavy debt.”
Carter, still watching, saw the glow of his eyes
narrow to a gleaming line as the heavy lids came
down over them.
“ A heavy debt owing over long,” the Afghan
repeated. “ Would’st like to hear the tale ? ” He
turned to the white men, and they both nodded
lazily.
“ As I have told I was bred in the hills by the
Gilgai Cut. Very deep lies the snow there in the
winter, and very deep and full rush the rivers
when the summer heat melts it. We are strong
and hardy, we hill folk, so that the white men are
glad when we take service with them. Also each
one to their army means one less in the never-end-
ing feuds of the mountains; for the blood
courses quickly in the high hill air, and we are
different from the plains’ men.
“ It was in a raid, I remember, against a neigh-
boring tribe, that I won me a bride. She was
tall, man-tall, and broad and fine-set, and her
hair—three plaits of it there were that swung to
her knees, and each one as broad as my hand here.
And her skin was smooth and soft as a woman’s
should be, and her body was supple and graceful
as a tiger’s.
“Mir Ullah was of the village from which I
took her, and he was bargaining with her father
even then for the girl. So he was angry, was Mir
Ullah, and declared feud against me.
"Little we cared, my hill girl and I, for she
grew to love me well, and' the time was near
when, by Allah’s grace, she might have borne me
a son. Then the English came up to our village.
Mir Ullah, the dog, had taken service with them
and sworn to a score of us as border thieves, with
me as head of the band.
“They took us very early one morning. There
was no fighting and no trouble, for we were
trapped (that treacherous hound knew every trick
of the rocks). Bound like any carrion, they took
us down to their place of justice. It was weary
work waiting for the trial, and Mir Ullah was
safe out of our way. At last they brought us
before the Judge, and the lawyer men both sides
(for we were a sfrpng and wealthy tribe) fought
each for their own.
" By the favor of Allah ours won, and by-and-
bye we were free men again, though they gave us
nothing to help heal the injury they had done us.
“ But my woman was gone when we got back to
the tribe.' There had been fighting again, and
Mir Ullah’s men (of a surety it was that black-
hearted dog behind all): had seized her. Then
there was blood feud between his village and
mine, and many of them met death at my hands,
but I never saw my woman nor Mir Ullah again.
“ I had hoped to find him in you, Abdullah, for
Allah can make strange things come to pass, and
you are much alike, allowing for the years.
Then ” —and his words clicked sharp as steel on
steel—“then I might have slept sound at the
last. Still—in Allah’s time.”
Klisson’s driver spoke quickly :
“I have wife —white wifei-in Port Augusta—
but she is no good to me. She drinks the for-
bidden stuff ; also, she beats my little children.
I am sorry for thee, Shaptazh Khan.”
Shaptazh was on his feet; staring into the
night. “She was good to see, that hill girl of
mine,” he said softly, and swung off to his Lord of
the Desert, who seemed to have tired a little of
his noisy performance.
“X I—not like to be Mir JllaVi if Shaptazh
Khan ever meet him,” said Kli#ou’s driver, un-
easily.
Then Carter and Klisson made|ready for sleep.
“ I wonder,” said the new churn. “I wonder
very much if Shaptazh knows tny blessed Ab-
dullah or not. What do you say, Carter ? ”
“One of us’ll be minus a driverif your beggar
really is Mir Ullah, an' I think he is, an’ I also
thj.nk Shaptazh knows it.”
■ “So do I,” said Klisson; “ and I wish we were
'well out of the mess. Jove! listen to your pet
roaring the night down. He’s started again.
'Van’ll never sleep.”
“Oh yes, we will,” returned Carter confidently.
“ You’ll have to get used to worse than this in the
carp ql game.”
It was turning cold. Outside the open tent-fly
a slow wind was shifting a white vaporish mass
that rose slowly from the ground. A little Of it
drifted in, and a cold blast took Klisson sharply
by the thrbat, so that he had to cough.
“Like a girl’s hair, isn’t it?” said Carter sud-
denly when the mist had cleared.
“What is?.”
“ThesmellJ” Carter answered. “No, not the
camels, you bloomin’ fool—the ground. I remem-
ber once, down at Hergott Springs it was, a girl
with a mass o’, hair—thick, like Shaptazh was
tellin’ about, though it wasn’t long, but curly an’
frizzy an’ wavy all at once.”
“Springy !” suggested Klisson.
“Yes, that’s thfi word. Well, you couldn’t
have held it in your, two hands, an’ it drifted
across my face one, might, an’ there was a scent
like what comes from the ground after a hot day
when the night-cool strikes it. It’s subtle an’
smotherin’ sweet, an’—hang you. Klisson, what
are you sniggering at? /She’s married an’ got
kids, for all I know, by now. Stop it, I tell
you !” and a boot flew through the darkness.
Then, bar the row npade by the Lord of the
Desert, who had remembered his anger again,
there was silence, and Garter lay and thought of
the girl with the wondrous hair at Hergott
Springs, and finally fell asleep.
Once, half-way towards morning, he woke, and
hearing the irregular breaths of his companion
knew him to be awake too.
“ D’ye mind getting up and shooting your
infernal brute now?” queried Klisson amicably,
“because you know I’d like to get some rest. An
extra relay of devils seems to have crawled into
his anatomy.”
They heard Shaptazh Khan’s voice soothing the
brute, and presently there was quiet again.
It was morning when Shaptazh came into the
tent to rouse them, stepping softly and calling
Carter’s name in a. sibilant whisper. Klisson
heard the quick run of strange-sounding
words, and saw Carter’s face colorless in the
thin, grey light.
“My God, Klissoq ! I wish I’d taken your
advice. Shaptazh Khan found the camel gone,
broken loose, and Abdullah worried to death.”
“ Truly the ways of Allah are many and wonder-
ful,” said the Afghan piously as they stooped over
the crushed, bespattered thing that had been
Abdullah or Mir Ullah.
“Yes,” Carter assented dryly, picking up a
blood-stained fragment of hemp and pointing out
to Klisson. a reddish, snaky trail leading from
under the dead man’s body, and only visible now
as the sun came out. “ And so are the ways in
which a rope can truss a man’s body and
then be dragged off when its work is done. Bub
when a mad camel has amused itself with him for
an hour or two, even a dozen coroners could hardly
tell whether he was dead or alive when he met
the animal. So we’ll let it go at that, Klisson.”

Does Your Back
Ever Ache ?
*Every picture
tells a story.’*
Don’t make light of
a pain in the back. It
means there is conges-
tion and inflammation
in the kidneys—that
the kidneys are
clogged and inactive,
can’t do their whole
duty of Altering the
blood. It means the
circulation of impure
blood throughout the
body, a weakening of
every nerve, muscle,
and vital organ.
Doan’s Dackache
Kidney Pills have a
quick and direct action
on the kidneys. They
drive out the poisons
that infest the blood,
cleanse and stimulate
the kidneys, regulate
and languor, and per-
the urine, cure backache, dizziness
manently heal the kidneys.
A Sydney Man’s
LASTING CURE BY DOAN’S PILLS.
Mr. P. Smith, 1 Cheltenham Street, Balmain, Sydney, says:—“l
used Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills for kidney trouble, and they worked
a miracle in my case. I had been under three doctors at different
times, but their treatment did me no good. I used to be so bad that I
would have to be carried home on a cart if an attack came on when .
working in the street. Sometimes I have been taken to the hospital
when one of these attacks came on. My wife says she thought that I
would never live through some of these bad turns. I suffered with a
kind of biliousness and vomiting. My secretions were seriously dis-
ordered. I could never bend my back or move at all when I had a bad
turn. The people at the hospital gave me medicines and recommended
rubbing in liniments, but it was no use, they did not benefit me. I
saw an advertisement for Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, and procured
this remedy. I only took one box and was cured. When I finished
them I started work, and have worked ever since. It is heavy work I .
am doing, but it does not affect me. These pills cured me after years of
suffering, and the relief was almost instantaneous.”
Mrs. Smith confirms the above nine years later My husband
has had wonderful health since he used Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills,
he is so well now. lam convinced that he owes his life to this remedy.”
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills cure Inflammation of
the Kidneys and Bladder, Pain or Dull Ache in
the Back, Joints and Muscles; cure Gravel,
Weak Heart, and all Urinary Troubles.

BACKACHE KIDNEY PILLS
Piles.
Cured After Years of Suffering—
Proof that Doan’s Ointment
Will Cure Piles.
Mr. Peter A. Dunn, late Postmaster at
Moruya, now living' with his daughter, who
is Postmistress at Gordon, Sydney, writes :
“I furnish you herewith, unsolicited, rpy ex-
perience of the use of Doan’s Ointment. lam
in my 03rd year, and was for 20 years subject
to itching piles. The pain and irritation of
this complaint were very hard to bear.
Twelve years ago a chemist at Deniliquin
told me that he had tried various remedies,
but did not know of a cure for this complaint..
Therefore, I tried but few remedies, as I had
no hope of ever finding a cure, especially as
the few I did try proved ineffectual. A man
told me he had suffered , terribly, and was
advised to use Doan’s Ointment. He did sp,
and it cured him ; and that man would have
given £2O to anyone! who guaranteed to cure
him as Doan’s Ointment did. I obtained a
pot of the Ointment and used it as directed,
night and morning. I only used half a pot
and was free of the complaint, and remained
so for some months. I felt a slight return of
the irritation, however, and applied the
Ointment for a few days, when I was perfectly
cured. I sent a box to an elderly clergyman,
a friend of mine, who had suffered for 30
years, and he has since informed me that a
few applications cured him. His doctor had
prescribed remedies which burned him dread-
fully. but did not cure. The same doctor
told him that he did not think there was a
cure, as he could not cure himself. A natural
repugnance to reveal private matters is over-
come by the hope of doing a good turn to
other sufferers. You can therefore publish
this, and those who see it may rely on it being
a truthful statement.”
Six years later, Mr. Dunn says : —“ Doan s
Ointment proved a permanent cure for itching
piles in my case. I have been free of this
torturing ailment for the past six years.
Doan’s Ointment is sdld by all chemists and
storekeepers at 2s. 9d. per pot, or will be
posted on receipt of price by Foster-McClellan
Co., 76 Pitt Street, Sydney.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
OH ! have you been in Wowserland?—But I
forgot; I’ll swear
Ihat I was told* there’s nothing short of
saints and angels there.
Perhaps you went a penitent. Thev say the faith
is grand,
And all is clean and bright and pure up there in
Wowserland.
Oh ! yes I d been in Wowserland, through many
a fearsome year;
And I escaped from Wowserland, per medium of
beer.
I was a living skeleton, I’d scarcely any sand.
My hair was grey that desperate day I cut from
Wowserland.
But is there faith in Wowserland, and is there
faith and truth ?
And is there love in Wowserland, and is there
love and youth ?
The good folk here, they tell me things I cannot
understand,
seem have no use for such as we, in
Wowserland..
But is , there love in Wowserland? For love is
everywhere—
-1 here must be some full-blooded men and warm-
eyed women there?
And are there men in Wowserland ? Men of the
rebel brand.
They fight in every other clime—why not in
Wowserland?
I here is no love in Wowserland, but bloodlessness
and dust;
And where there's strength in Wowserland are
hidden hate and lust.
But there are men in Wowserland, and I know
one at least,
A leader of a rebel band who should have been a
priest.

HENRY LAWSON.
An Engine-Room and Some
Reflections.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
MY friend Evans of the Turakina has
just been showing' me his engines ; and
from that spectacle I return to familiar
objects a little depressed and a little exhilarated
—some new depression of contempt for brains
that merely sing or say things, some new ex-
hilaration of respect for brains that Do. Also, I
have lost a notable part of my long-persistent
reverence for navigators. That obsession had
been deep and stubborn. Voyaging in many
seas, in many ships—yea, even in the acrobatic
Mahinapua from Hobart to Strahan, and in the
hiceupy Julia Percy from Rockhampton to Bris-
bane—l have never been sea-sick since the day
when, a thousand years ago, a certain shipmaster
threatened incontinently to throw me overboard
if I was. But now—well, you know, things are
slipping into perspective, and I begin to under-
stand. shipmasters shine no longer in my mind
as the superior sort of deities they were when Dr
Gordon Stables (his son is third officer of the Tura-
kina) thrilled the boyish heart of me with his “Cruise
of the Snowbird.” Shipmasters and all their kin
have come to be simple objects familiarly at hand,
do steer and superintend a ship according to well-
marked rules and precedents-toread with reason-
able accuracy the signs written for all we can
conceive of eternity in the'immutable deep skies
—this, after all, shows as a slight thjng enough.
Strictly in its proportion and degree, to pilot a
trail canoe down boisterous rapids is a task re-
quirmg more delicacy and nerve, more personal
force and character, than to pilot one of your up-
holstered liners from Colombo to Fremantle In-
deed, but strictly in the professional sense, I have
a greater respect for my old skipper of the Con-
queror than I have for the captain of the Power-
ful. Ihe boss of the wooden windjammer was
you see, so much more at the mercy of the ele-
mental energies and caprices. Although we
honest sailormen were assured several times a day
that we were not worth powder enough to blow us
to the place vous savez, there is a certain pleasure
in remembering that the old Conqueror snorted
round the Leeuwin under all sail, roaring by an
English steel clipper that wallowed a mile abeam 1
under close-reefed tops’ls; and when we reached
Hong Ivong a day too late for our charter, our
skippers language was as fine (in a way) as any-
thing you can discover in Euripides. I was a
beginner then, and although my admiration was
grudged, it was thorough.
And now, as I .say, I discover that these
skippers are but men like you and me. The
engineers are different. They dominate and
control the grim titanic forces that vitalise these
infinitecomplexitiesof mechanism. They harness
and direct the powers of Hell, loosing their turbu-
lent might into these vast resounding cylinders
and stupendous pounding cranks and things : arid
smiling, with their cool hands on little levers, the
engineers .can bid those powers be still. This is,-1
t link, a finer and a mightier accomplishment than
any achieved on deck or in the limelight.. Perhaps
the thought comes to me with special force just
now because I realise anew that these engineers
are makers; and in all my life I never made any-
thing but a few serious mistakes, and a few (I hope-
more numerous) ineffective efforts to do well, as
, V’ or somebody once put it. Howeverthat may
be, these engines have impressed me more than any-
th,ngl ever saw in naked nature ; and so, coming
straight from these engines, I find myself looking
on the navigating officers of the ship with some-
thing of the amused and tolerant contempt that I
lavish unsparingly on mvself and my like We
are, by comparison with tiie masterful men of the
engine-room, mere amateurs of easy effects, mere
watchers of remembered signs who catch the
opportunity. I admit all this without compunc-
tion, because I know that the navigators of this
ship will catch my drift and understand my mood.
I have an inveterate affection for shipmen, be-
cause the sea seems to sweeten even while it
hardens them. The sea sweetened me, and
although I did not remain long before the mast I
have been indefatigably amiable ever since. The
sea hardened me also. Before I went aboard the
Conqueror I could not look at a corpse, if it'hap-
pened to be what you may call a sudden corpse,
without qualms and nervous tremors ; but now I
could cheerfully furnish a list from which, you
might make a heap of the newly-dead the con-
templation of vvhich would yield me nothing but
a sense of gratitude and very gentle joy.
I know delightfully little about mechanics.
That may be clue in part to the fact that I once
spent a year in <vn engirte.er,ing-shc>p. When I
first reached Sydney an influential uncle had me
apprenticed to Chapman and Co., who (for aught
I know to the contrary) may still be making a
horrid diurnal din at the foot of Druitt-street. I
detested the din and the dirt so much that when
I escaped I resolutely forgot all I was supposed
to have learned. I forgot so happily and com-
pletely that the Turakina’s engine-room recalled
nothing to remembrance, and I come away with
words like “evaporators" and “condensers”
ringing in my recollection, as unfamiliar but
sprightly names once seen on a map may ring and
linger. If I remembered anything, really, the
glamor of this experience would be disturbed or
dissipated. As it is, the great deep pit so full of
those gaunt, tremendous arms and gnarled
connections, those swart squat bulbs and
looming cylinders, that interminable tangle of
pipes and .rods and couplings—all this, I say,
smote on my senses as some strange, enchanted
forest designed by the Devil to be permanent in a
dimness of subdued twilight. Here and there
from out the shrouding gloom hunted eyes peered
at us ; now and then dark-visaged workers, dingily
clothed, came and went with oil-cans and strange
tools. Evans and I, more or less immaculately
garmented, were suggestive to my fancy of
bank-managers adrift in Tophet. The idea
of myself as a bank-manager was so deliciously
novel and incongruous that I laughed ; and
my laugh, as it cackled, among those distorted
rodsand ordered shapelessnesses, asif thinned away
in slight cacophonous trickles to the bilge, was
like a profanation. Evans looked at me severely,
and I dreamed a dream while he explained a lubri-
cator. People are for ever explaining things to
me. It is very good of them, but quite useless.
I dreamed that this unhappy ship, suddenly
and utterly unmanned, was at sea under a
full head of steam. The crew had gone,
and in the place of the crew were all sorts
of unproductive fellows I know—writers and
musicians, stringers of tinkling verses, specialists
of tawdry or insensate creeds, spinners of futile
theories, jugglers of dubious politics. I was, for
some unearthly reason, acting as chief engineer,
and I found myself wrestling with a lever as I
tried to put her astern, because my hat had gone
overboard, and I had promised Australia to land
Mr. Wade on the Kerguelens; but the lever in-
sisted on behaving riotously, and struck me
violently over and over again in the places that
hurt most. Arthur Adams (whom I met for the
first time, and promptly recognised by his exotic
vocabulary) insisted on doing something artistic ;
so I sent him down a dark-hole with a tin of Jud-
son’s and a brush to decorate the shaft. On the
bridge, Grant Hervey, who was acting as com=
mander, was reciting his latest verses through a
megaphone to a terrified Japanese cruiser in the
offing; and, one way and another, the noise was
deafening. To add to my anxiety, Norman Lind-
say insisted on bathing in the biggest boiler;
and George Reid, Iceberg Irvine, Bruce Smith,
Senator Dobson and Allan Hamilton, who were the
firemen on duty, objected so offensively to the
extra work involved that I sent up to Randolph
Bedford (who was acting butcher) to borrow a
poleaxe. John Norton and Smiler Hales, who
were our chaplains, were intoning the burial ser-
vice from separate mastheads when we climbed
joyously over our first iceberg and went to dinner.
As we happened now to be in Labrador, we had
stewed moose to start with, because Mrs. Helen
Jerome and Miss Conor-O’Brien, who were the
acting cooks, had decided that the soup and fish
should be served with whipped cream for dessert.
Roderic Quinn wept profusely into the spinach as
he recited some verses about the soundless deep
coming again home, or words to that effect;
whereupon Professor Tucker was ordered into
irons for conduct unbefitting an officer and
a gentleman ; and Dick Stewart, who was
director of entertainments, besought us to let
the sentence be anything but that. This objection
necessitated an appeal to the Privy Council, and
Mr. Edmund Barton, who was on his way to New
York to conduct a mission to millionaires, was
grievously annoyed by the loss of time involved.
One way and another,' things were more than
usually complicated, when
“Of course,” said Evans, “a man does feel his
responsibility when he makes his first trip as
chief. Afterwards..? —oh, well, it’s all in the day’s
work. By the way, you might tell yoursea-poets
that they’re working the martyred fireman vein
out a bit. It’s invariably cooler in the stokehold
than in the engine-room. Come and see.”
I went and saw. I found, to start with, much
more space before the furnaces than I had been
led to look for, and much less'heat. There was a
steady currept from the big air-shafts that I found
too strong for comfoyt.
This, however, is merely incidental. I’ve strayed
somewhat away from my point, which was that
these engineers are makers. I don’t suppose that
the navigating officers, if put to it, could make a
chart-house or a binnacle, any more than I could
make a hencoop. But if anything goes wrong
with the big engines, the engineers go to work to
put things right. Repairs below there often mean
re-making. Apart from the engineers themselves,
no mechanics are carried. There is no class to
correspond to the class of engine-room -artificers
"on a warship. A ship’s engineer, in these cir-
cumstances, has to be vastly more than engine-
driver. And I leave you to imagine the diffi-
culties that may and must accompany the task of
emergency engineering in that cramped space,
annd grey lumbering seas.
In face of these considerations, I—albeit accus-
tomed to the .humility and self-effacement of
newspaper-men and journalists—find the modesty
of engineers positively appalling. Evans
and his co-workers could not see—l was quite
unable to persuade them—that in the order of
their work there was anything in tbe nature of
special achievefnent,-anything- calling for especial
courage or nervous force. Everything is taken
for granted ;■ everything is matter of course. In
case of sudden disaster, have the engineers on
duty much chance of escape ? Of course not. If
a boiler bursts, for instance, have the engineers on
duty much hope of saving their lives? Of course
not. Do these considerations deter men from
adopting the profession, or discourage them in its
practice? Good Lord ! of course not. In most
instances, the position is much worse on a war-
ship. ,
And one way and another, although I could
never drive a nail straight or do anything ingeni-
ous or extraordinary, I begin to have a certain
impatience with myself as a mere scribbler of
trivialities and faker of rhymes. The man who
mn,ke§ a loaf is an incomparably more useful
citizen than the man who merely makes a lyric.
Better to move a mountain than merely to move a
multitude. The average microbe, being persis-
tently busy about its- natural business, is a far
stauncher friend of' humanity than the average
monarch. As to what you call the artistic tem-
perament—well, if you’ve got it you’ve got it, and
it s useless whining. But... to be proud of having
it! One might as reasonably be proud of having
a chronic thirst in the Sahara.

PLAIN TRUTHS
on the subject of Health are the only acceptable pronouncements.
Exaggerated statements end by convincing no one—rather do they create
suspicion, and give rise to doubt. But ybu may safely listen to universal
opinion. The public have for long known the value of Beecham’s Pills
in cases of disorder and irregularity of the Stomach, Bowels, Liver and
Kidneys. Thousands of men and women know, from glad experience,
that an occasional dose of Beecham’s Pills will promote the healthy action
of these organs, and that all the good things heard on every hand
ABOUT
this medicine are true in the strictest sense. Most people desire a
specific that can be depended upon at all times to correct the vital
functions when they are out of order and Nature calls for some assist-
ance. Such a preparation may be found in BEECHAM’S PILLS.
They will put you right and keep you up to the mark. They have
proved an immense boon to many thousands of men and women
all over the world. It is just as certain that they will benefit you
and this is a plain truth you may accept and act upon in regard to
BEECHAM’S
PILLS.

FROOTOIDS
Cure Headache, Indigestion, Constipa-
tion, and Biliousness. They are elegant
in appearance and pleasant to take:
they are immensely more valuable than
an ordinary ajperient; they remove from
the blood, tissues, and interna) organs,
waste poisonous matter that is clogging
them and choking the channels that lead
to and from them. Frootoids are
THE BEST
aperient medicine to take when any
Congestion or Blood Poison is present,
or when Congestion of the Brain or
Apoplexy is present or threatening. They
have been tested, and have been proved
to afford quick relief in such cases when
other aperients have not done ‘any good
at all. Frootoids are absolutely un-
rivalled for
FAMILY
use ; their beneficial effects are evident
by the disappearance of headache—a
bright cheery sense of perfect health
taking the place of sluggish depressed
feelings, by the liver acting properly, and
by the food being properly digested.
Frootoids are a very economical
MEDICINE.
A dose taken once a week, at bed-time,
is highly beneficial. They act splendidly
on the Liver. A constipated habit of
body will be completely cured if the
patient will on each occasion, when
suffering, take a dose of Frootoids in-
stead of an ordinary aperient. The
sufferer thus gradually becomes quite
independent of Aperient Medicines.
