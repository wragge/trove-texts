No medical man advertising in these colonies has medica
degrees which can he compared with his. Such eminen'
qualifications, together with his recognised straightfor
ward treatment, has naturally gained for him the reputa-
tion of being the

Knowledge Honest Treatment, as may easily be ascer-
tained by applying to any leading paper in the colony.
No diseases cause so much misery and distress as those

cesses, indigestion, foul mouth, costiveness, palpi-
tation, singing and pains in the ears and head,

memory, pains in the back and chest, varicocele,
diseases of the bladder, kidneys, or liver, rheuma-
tism, impure blood, weakening discharges, impaired
vigor, sterility, premature decay, stricture, nervous-
ness, groundless fears, bashfulness, lassitude, and

consulting him, since he has, by long experience
and thorough investigation of their nature, dis-
covered the safest treatment for their permanent
cure. Persons residing at adistance may be treated
at their own homes, without any interruption to
their business, by giving a full and clear descrip-
tion of their symptoms, and the necessary medi-

If the patient’s case is of long standing, and, therefore

complaint, and if I can effect a cure, the time it will take,
and the cost of doing so. My long experience in the
treatment of Nervous Diseases has made me thoroughly
conversant with all their peculiarities. I am prepared,
therefore, to
Guaranies a Ferment and Complete fare is every case I undertake.
I invite the fullest investigation into my qualifications. For some time I was House Surgeon to the Great
Northern Hospital, London, where I had special opportunities of investigating the causes of Nervous Diseases, and
bee vine perfectly acquainted with the most approved scientific and successful methods of affecting their cure.

DR, KELLY’S REPUTATION IS SO THOROUGHLY ESTABLISHED THAT IT WILL
ONLY BE NECESSARY FOR HIM TO INTIMATE THAT HE IS PRACTISING AS A
SPECIALIST TO BE APPRECIATED AS A BENEFACTOR TO SUFFERING MANKIND. AS
THE GREATER PORTION OF THE NEW SOUTH WALES PUBLIC IS AWARE, DR. KELLY
IS A LEGALLY QUALIFIED AND REGISTERED PHYSICIAN, AND HAS BY FAR THE
LARGEST PRACTICE IN THE COLONIES. MANY PERSONS AT A DISTANCE, HOWEVER,
ARE UNAWARE OF HIS GREAT SUCCESS, AS, HITHERTO, HE HAS REFRAINED FROM
ADVERTISING. HENCE, TO WIDEN THE SPHERE OP HIS USEFULNESS, HE HAS
DETERMINED, BY MEANS OP ADVERTISING, TO MAKE HIMSELF KNOWN IN REMOTE
DISTRICTS WHERE HIS REPUTATION MAY NOT YET HAVE TRAVELLED. AS THE
QUESTION MAY ARISE, WHY DOES SO EMINENT A PHYSICIAN AS DR. KELLY FIND
IT NECESSARY TO ADVERTISE, HE MAY REPLY TO ONE AND ALL AS FOLLOWS
IP THERE IS A PERSON ON EARTH TO BE PITIED IT IS HE WHO IS OBLIGED
TO ASSOCIATE WITH HIS FELLOW BEINGS WHILE HIS MIND IS CONSTANTLY
HARASSED AND TORTURED BY THE CONSCIOUSNESS OP
WHAT MUST INEVITABLY FOLLOW.
HE LOOKS HAGGARD AND SHEEPISH. HE IS NERVOUS IN PUBLIC, AND EXTREMELY
GIRLISH AND BACKWARD IN LADIES’ SOCIETY. THE VICTIM OP THIS, THE MOST
DANGEROUS OP ALL VICES, IP NOT RELIEVED, SOON REACHES A STATE WHICH MUST
END IN LIFE-LONG MISERY. HE MUST ULTIMATELY SINK TO THE LOWEST STAGE
OF DEGRADATION AND SHAME. DR. KELLY MAINTAINS THAT THE PHYSICIAN WHO
HAS THE POWER TO CURE, AND REMAINS SILENT, IS GUILTY OF AN UNPARDONABLE
SIN OF OMISSION. PERSONS WHO READ HIS GREAT WORK ON THIS SUBJECT WILL
BE SHOWN THE INEVITABLE RESULT OP THE BAD HABITS, AND IN MOST
INSTANCES SUFFICIENTLY EARLY IN LIFE TO ENABLE THEM
TO SEE THEIR FOLLY
BEFORE ANY DISEASE HAS TAKEN POSSESSION OF THEM, THE BOOK WILL ALSO
SHOW THEM CLEARLY
HOW TO CURB THE DISEASE WITHOUT
THE ASSISTANCE OF PHYSICIAN OR CHEMIST.
MANY PERSONS WONDER WHY THEIR MEMORY IS NOT SO RETENTIVE, AND THEIR
GENERAL INTELLECT NOT SO CLEAR AND STRONG AS THEY FORMERLY WERE.
DR KELLY’S BOOK WILL EXPLAIN THE CAUSE IN PLAIN AND SIMPLE LANGUAGE.
THEREFORE EVEN THOUGH YOU BE FREE PROM DISEASE, SEND FOR THIS GREAT
MEDICAL WORK, THAT YOU MAY BE ENABLED TO ADVISE OTHERS AFTER PERUSING
ITS PAGES VERY FREQUENTLY THIS MAY BE DONE BEFORE ANY GREAT HARM
HAS TAKEN PLACE.

MANNER IS ECCENTRIC, LISTLESS, SHY AND EASILY CONFUSED,
HIS MOVEMENTS ARE SHUFFLING AND UNCERTAIN, AND
BETRAY A MIND ILL AT EASE, HIS MENTAL OPERATIONS ARE
ERRATIC, HE IS EMBARRASSED, AWKWARD, AND ACTS WITHOUT

The Most Useful Ointment in the World,
Bar None.
PREMIER OINTMENT is the SOUTHERN
HEMISPHERE. But, as many new arrivals
have lately made New South Wales their home, it
may b is well to let them know that there is such
an rtiele as JOSEPHSON’S OINTMENT purely
the production of the colony, com posed of wild plants
indigenous to the country and nowhere else, the
principal of which is the EUCALYPTUS, now
so famed thoroughout the world.
Josephson’s Ointment is purely vegetable, and
Guakanteed Peek from all Poisonous
Qualities. No Artificial Colouring, as the
Green colour is extracted from the pure green
plants, which defy imitation.
WHO SHOULD SUPPER PROM PILES,
when one application will relieve you?
Read this letter and Try for Yourselves
Messrs. E. Row and Co.
Dear Sirs,- —I have tried your Jo ephson’s Oint-
ment for Piles, and have found much relief from
using it. You are at liberty to use this if you feel
disposed.
1 remain, yours, etc.,
L. P. SOLOMONS, Herald Office.
STUDY HEALTH BY TAKING ROW’S
STEANE’S BITTERS.
The great demand throughout the colony for
these pux’e Bitters shows they are superior to all
others and equalled by none.
Pacts Speak Louder than Words.
Read this sworn testimony from a well-known
citizen:—
Statutory Declaration.
“I, George Hewett, do hereby solemly and
sincerely declare as follows :
“ That I feel it a duty I owe to the publi •to
state that I have been suffering for many years
from weakness of the stomach, so called INDI-
GESTION or DYSPEPSIA, and have been cured
by my taking two or three glasses of ROW’S
STEANE’S BITTERS a day in a little water, and
I hope others suffering from the same complaint
will be as speedily cured.
“(Signed) G. HEWETT,
“ 215 Pitt-street.
How’s Stea-ne’s Wine
Is a safe and sure stimulant for the female sex or
children, for it raises and strengthens depressed
systems without producing a temporary excite-
ment to be followed by greater depression.
Persons suffering from loss of appetite and
general depression of spirits cannot do better than
take
ROW’S STEANE’S WINE.
It cannot harm you, but must do good to all
delicate persons. Young Ladies can take this
when suffering from general debility. It’s only a
pure tonic. Try it.
Teetotallers will find this newly-invented
TONIC answer all the purposes of a stimulant
without its intoxicating quality. It will satisfy
the cravings of nature and create a desire for food
instead of drink. As an anti-febrile is unsur-
passed.
ROW’S
DANDELION
BITTERS.
We recommed these BITTERS to be taken
two or three times a day; a wineglassful for an
adult, smaller quantity for children.
Por General Debility, Dyspepsia, Rheumatism,
and Cutaneous Affections.
The action of dandelion, more especially upon
the liver and kidneys, in more reliable for remov-
ing all impure secretions than any other medicinal
plant known.
Persons suffering from Skin diseases will find
these Bitters invaluable.
DIRECTIONS FOR USE.
One wineglass two or three times a day after
meals diluted with same quantity of water. Por
young people about half the quantity twice a day.
They Purify the Blood and Liver.
See what a Medical Gentleman says
about them.
Messrs. E. Row and Co.
With thanks for forwarding me a bottle of your
Row’s Dandelion Bitters, and consider them most
excellent, and superior to many others that I have
previously tried. Yours faithfully, HEN iY
CHARLES CURTIS, M.R.C.S., England.
Port Adelade, October 30, 1886.
Read an expression of thankfulness received
from the undersigned :
“ I have for many years been obliged to take
medicines of different kinds for affections of the
liver, indigestion, pain in the chest, general de-
bility, feeling of nervousness, weariness, great
depression of spirits, and so on, but all without
producing any beneficial effect, till at last, bein<>-
recommended to try ROW’S DANDELION
BITTERS, which, happily, I find has produced
an unexpected and wonderful effect and change
m my system, and has removed from my mind
the horrible depressed feeling and former con-
dition of bodily ailment I have so unhappily ex-
perienced for so many years.
“ I am glad of the opportunity to make known
the excellent qualities of ROW’S DANDELION
BITTERS, that those who are affleted as I have
been may take advantage of them.
“ I remain, dear sirs,
“Respectfully yours,
“MARY TERRILL,

Subject of Importance.
Respecting the virtues of the Dandelion
Root in cases of Lwer Complaint, ai *d
the many diseases following in its train, we read
in that standard work of Bentley’s (“ Medicinal
Plants”) that Dandelion “is regarded as slightly
Tonic, Aperient and Diuretic. It appears to
have an almost specific action on the Liver, by
modifying and increasing its secretion. Hence
it is extensively employed in Chronic Diseases
of the Digestive Organs, or Enlargement of
the Liver, Dropsies from Hepatic Obstruction,
and Dyspepsia, attended with deficient Biliary
Secretion.”
By the foregoing, it is evident that in the Dandelion
JlsOOt we find the best remedy known to the Medical World
for all forms of
Liver Complaint,
IK iciney Disease,
IMPOVERISHMENT of the BLOOD,
AND THE MANY OTHER ILLS ARISING THEREFROM.

A Tale of His Youth.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
It is now about ten years since I visited the
Asylum for the Insane at New Norfolk, near
Hobart. At that time, among the inmates
detained there, was an old man, whose magnificent
physique and kindly face attracted the attention
of all visitors. I had occasion to pass with one of
the warders through the yard in which this ancient
patient was sunning himself, when he stopped us,
and in the most engaging manner asked Whether I
should like to hear his Bee. Not wishing to dis-
oblige, I mechanically replied in the affirmative.
Thereupon he proceeded to the edge of the
verandah and stationed himself at the beginning
of a track worn in the gravel of the yard. The
track was about 15 yards in length, and had been
formed by the constant walking to and fro (as I
afterwards discovered) of the old man himself.
Having placed himself in position, he drew him-
self up straight, advanced five paces and yelled
in a horrible, croaking, rasping voice—“Bee, bee,
bee !” Then, moving five paces forward, he made
the same sound ; still another five paces to the end
of the track and he again gave forth his horrid
monosyllable. Looking at his retreating figure,
I saw that with each cry he trembled violently in
every limb, but I was not prepared for the hideous
expression of face which he presented as, turning
round, he marched back again, yelling his fiendish
war-cry as he came. As the old fellow evidently
threatened a repetition of the performance, I was
glad to get away, and as we walked across the
yard I heard the “ Bee ” eighteen times repeated.
“That man,” said the warder, “ is the father of
the place. He was confined here long before any
of the present staff were employed. Strange to
say, he is now due for a lucid interval; this we
know from observing him in other years. For the
past week he has had only three of those attacks
daily, as against ten or twelve on other days ; for
two days more, if I am right in my reckoning, he
will keqp up the performance. The third day from
now he will remain in his bed in a state of coma,
and the following morning he will get up sane, and
continue so for a few days, usually five. But if he
tells his story before these days elapse his interval
will be shorter, for when he reaches the climax he
lapses into madness. His periods of sanity occur
once a year—generally, too, about this time. If
you eare to come any day during his rational
moments you may get him to tell you his history.”
Not wishing to shorten the poor wretch’s perio'd
of sanity I waited for the fifth day, and having
discovered my man, speedily found myself engaged
in conversation witli him. He was at first disin-
clined to talk, but having mentioned amongst
other things, that I came from New South Wales
and knew that province pretty well, he suddenly
asked me if 1 had ever been to Port Macquarie.
Having assured him that I was intimately
acquainted with the place, the old man brightenec.
up and said :
“ Well, then, you might like to hear about me.
What I am going to speak of happened many a
year ago, and you are too young to know anything
about it, but, maybe, if your grandfather is alive
he may have heard of Walter Magnan, once Cap-
tain in the Tenth Foot. I had at that time a
grant of land on the coast not far from Port
Macquarie. The house I lived in was just about
half-a-mile from the sea. The ground about it for
40 acres or so was cleared and divided into pad-
docks. I had five Government men working on
the place, and on the day of my story, I, with four
of them, had started out early in the morning to
recover some cattle, that had strayed away. We
took rations for three days, as I expected to have
some difficulty in finding the beasts. By good luck
we came across them before noon. As I was
sending them across to the Manning, and as they
were in good grass, I left two of the men behind
me and turned back with the others.
“On the way home we pulled up at Shultz’s
shanty, when, to tell the truth, I got pretty well
drunk, and the two fellows I had with me were
not backward in following my example. Leaving
the shanty we worked our way through the bush
till we reached the coast and got on to a track
which led us home. There is a little island about
a square chain in area lying some 30 or 40 yards
off the main land, and having a natural prolonga-
tion about four feet wide, terminating abruptly
within ten or twelve feet of the shore. Between
the mainland and the causeway is very deep water.
The island is high, but there is a broad ledge on
the shore-side, level with the causeway, and two
feet above the ledge is, or was at that time, a
recess excavated out of the solid stone. Across
the gap between the shore and the causeway I had
placed a plank to give access to the island, because
at times the fishing under the shelter of the shore
was very good. I had no intention of stopping,
but seeing the plank removed I drew rein, anxious
to learn the cause of this circumstance —for no one
ever went to the island except with me or by rny
orders. Nor was my curiosity lessened when I
observed ray man, Peter O’Heir, whom I had left
at the homestead, kneeling or crouching in front
of the recess, which he nearly hid from view.
“‘Peter has taken a funny place to say his
prayers,’ said I, and I shouted to the fellow to
know what he was doing. But he made no reply
to me nor to the shouts of the men who were with
me; he did not even look to see who called ; the
only sign of hearing or life that he gave was the
spreading out of his elbows a little further, as if
to shelter more effectually the hole in the rock.
As I have said, we were all the worse for liquor
when we left Shultz’s, and by this time the demon
in me was a-fire for mischief.
“I was standing on a bed of loose stones,
rounded, smooth, and black, such as are found
everywhere about Port Macquarie, and stamping
with rage at Peter’s not answering, I knocked out
several pretty large ones. Mechanically picking
these up, I cried, ‘ Boys, I’ll make the dog answer 1’
With these words I threw a stone with such good
aim that it lodged fair on O’Heir’s back.
Here the old man paused as if lost in thought—
then, suddenly taking up the narrative, he
continued—
“ I remember, as if it were yesterday, the
‘ wooh !’ it made, and my fiendish laugh. ‘ Good
shot, master,’ cried the men, ‘try again!’ I
remember, too, O’Heir’s agonizing shriek, ending
in a prolonged ‘Be-e-ee!’ which wasintensely amus-
ing. We could not quite make out what he said, but
guessed it was, ‘ Oh, let me be !’ but, what with
my own swearing and the men’s jabbering, I only
caught the last syllable. It was very amusing.
Two or three times O’Heir repeated the cry,
and, as the men joined in the stone-throwing,
with every stone they threw they yelled out, * Bel’
“Strangely enough, none of the men could hit
O’Heir, although he presented a very good mark,
and was not more than thirty or forty yards away.
They were now cursing and swearing in fine style
at their bad luck, so, to aggravate them further,
I took aim again, this time striking old Peter on
the shoulder, at which he sent up a tremendous
how], then a cry—l suppose it was for mercy.
“ Commencing in a low voice, we could not dis-
tinguish what he said, but he ended as before with
‘Be !’ shrieked at the top of his voice. ‘ I thought
I heard a kid squeaking,’ said one of the men, at
which we all laughed and recommenced the stone-
throwing with fresh vigour. The last blow
seemed to have disabled O’Heir. His legs shot
out sideways along the ledge, his hands clutched
the sides of the recess, while his head fell for-
ward. His position now disclosed a bundle of
some sort in the cave. ‘ Let us aim at the hole,’
I cried, and throwing a stone as heavy as I could
manage, struck the bundle. Again the obsequious
wretches cheered, but strange to say they could
not do as I did.
“ ‘ What caper is the old dog up to?’ said I, as
Peter struggled to get his coat off. For awhile we
suspended our fun and watched him. With
infinite labour the old fellow succeeded in freeing
one arm and then the other, and rolling his coat
into a sort of ball, placed it in such a way as if to
protect the bundle in the recess. All this time he
had not attempted to look at his tormentors, and
the circumstance seemed to greatly annoy my
men, for, finding that he remained passive after
relieving himself of his coat, they proceeded with
the bombardment more furiously than before.
Strange to say, they now began to hit their man
with every throw, while I contrived to lodge my
missiles with great regularity in the recess, and
Peter’s coat specially suffered. We kept the sport
up for some time longer, even after O’Heir had
sunk prone on the ledge without sign of life. At
last I got tired and called out to the men to cease,
which they did with no little reluctance. So,
after a parting shot, we mounted our horses and
set our faces homewards.
“ I cannot, of course, answer for the other
fellows; they were low, savage, convict brutes,
but I felt no more compunction about having given
O’Heir a stoning than if he had been a native-
bear, and it was with a satisfied feeling that I
pushed my way through the scrub towards home.
Indeed, we amused ourselves after leaving the
scene of our exploit by mimicking old Peter’s
“Be ! Be ! Be ! ” in all sorts of tones, and I well
remember a very peculiar and, I must say, hor-
rible sound with which I managed to arouse the
laughter of the two men, for we were in excellent
humour. I wish I could give an imitation, but
my voice is not what it used to be. About a
quarter of a mile from the homestead I dismissed
the men, who were to go on to the Port to get a
few things I wanted, so as to be ready for an early
start in the morning.
“It was just about six when I got home.
Having dismounted, I threw the reins over a
post and immediately going into the bedroom
(lung myself face downwards on the bed. This
was a favourite practice of mine when I was very
tired or had too much drink. Tuis time the alcohol-
laden bio >d seemed immediately to rush tomy head,
producing a sort of stupor out of which itwa>
aim ist impossible to arouse me. In a minute or
so my wife came rushing in. She had been to the
stables to catch me b-fore 1 dismounted, but had
missed me. In vain she tugged at my shoulder to
r mse me; experience might have taught her to
have spared herself the trouble. I suppose it was
about nine o’clock the same night when I turned
on my side and awoke, calling for a drink, which
my wife eagerly procured. Her alacrity struck
me as peculiar, so I sat up waiting her return,
with the intention of chaffing her. In a minute
or two she came back with some rum, which I
swallowed quickly, as I was parched in the
throat. I had barely done so when the said :
‘ Have you seen Hubert ?’
“ ‘No,’I answered, ‘where should I see him?
Is he not at home ?’
“ First of all, I may tell you she was my second
wife. My first had been dead about two years,
and Hubert, my boy, was then hardly three years
old. His stepmother and I had been married
nearly twelve months. In answer to my question
she told me that about three o’clock that afternoon
three strangers rode up to the homestead and, dis-
mounting, asked for me, but, from their remarks,
she could see that they were very well aware that
I had gone after cattle, and was not likely to be
back for some days. The men were armed, but
my wife spoke to them with some confidence, as
she noticed Peter, the stableman, whom I had left
behind, listening and watching at the window.
After a little general talk, the three asked to see
the child Hubert, but my wife, fearing their inten-
tions, refused, whereat they became angry and
abusive, and proceeded to search the house.
While so doing, a disturbance amongst the horses
at the front attracted attention, and the men
rushed out, with my wife at their heels, only to
see Peter O’Heir scampering off on one of their
horses with little Hubert on the saddle in front of
him. Two of the fellows mounted and galloped
in pursuit of the flying Peter, and one of them,
getting pretty close, fired at him, the charge enter-
ing his left arm, possibly not doing serious damage.
A.t all events, Peter kept going, and almost imme-
diately the fellow who fired was thrown, and did
not mount again for some few minutes. Mean-
while, the man whose horse Peter had taken got
another from the paddock, but by that time the
rest were out of sight. That was all she knew
about it.
“Her story brought me to my senses quickly
enough. Where the child was, Peter would best
be able to say, that is, if he had any life left in
him. But it was no use going to the island at
once, for without a plank I could not get across,
and I had nothing about the place which would
serve the same purpose. There was no house
between mine and the Port, so I made up my
mind to go to town, get a cart and horse, and
carry a plank out to the island. There was just a
hope that Peter was alive. There was no use
lying about it —except that if he was dead I had a
hand in the murder, and might get into trouble,
I did not care whether Peter was alive or not.
My horse was pretty well done up, but for all
that I made him travel to the Port quicker than
he ever travelled before. It was past midnight
when I got there, and I lost no time in finding
my men and procuring a horse and cart and a
plank. The men guessed my business, for one of
them told me that he had heard, on his way to
the Port, about the unsuccessful attempt to kid-
nap Hubert.
“ It appears that, as soon as the man who was
thrown was able to remount, the pursuit of Peter
was continued, but the old man had too much
start, and, wounded as he was, succeeded in
getting as far as the island. How he had disposed
of the child, the bushrangers could not discover ;
they could not reach Peter, as he had pulled the
plank over after crossing to the causeway, and ho
would not give any answer to their questionings.
For a little while they had amused themselves
firing at him with their pistols, but without doing
or possibly intending to do any damage. Pre-
sently they were interrupted by the arrival of
their mate, whose horse Peter had taken. On his
way from the homestead, by the merest chance,
he had espied several horsemen on the coast road
coming towards them, and at this news the party
decamped,
“ We were the horsemen the fellow had seen,
and we could not have been ten minutes behind
them. All this my man learnt from his sister,
who was married to one Jack Findlay, whose
brother Joe was probably with the ruffians who
had visited my house. He had just come out of
gaol, where I had managed to have him sent for
using one of my horses. ‘ I have not forgotten
Joe yet,’ added the man, with a horrible scowl.
Here the warder beckoned to one of his assistants
who stood behind the old fellow as he proceeded
with his narrative —
“The sun was rising out of the sea as we got
abreast of the island. Peter was just in the same
position as when we left off our little game of
cockshot the evening before—it was plain that he
was dead. We shoved the plank across the gap.
I alone crossed. I did not forbid the men,going
with me, but they seemed disinclined to follow, so
I left them behind. When I reached the place
where Peter was lying I could see that no infor-
mation would ever be got out of him. His skull
was battered m and his face past recognition. The
ledge was broad; I walked past the body and
looked into the deep water beyond. There I saw
a lazy, blue-nosed shark, balanced, as it were, in
the water. Said Ito myself: ‘ He’s come in time
for breakfast,” so, without more ado, I dragged
Peter’s carcase to the place and let it failover.
God’s truth ! how the laziness left the blue devil;
instantly he made for Peter, and in a trice’some
friends came to help him. It was a great sight to
see the greedy wretches tear the body. I got a
couple of the stones we had thrown at Peter, and
threw them at the sharks. I managed to hit the
old man’s body, or rather what was left of it, but
that was all. The sport only lasted a minute or
two, and sharks and body were soon out of sight,
After all, thought I, it was well to be rid of
Peter; there would be no inquest on him now.
Having got on so far satisfactorily, my next step
was to find Hubert. Perhaps he might have
returned home, though this seemed unlikely for
he was little more than a baby, but it was just as
well I should go home and make certain about it.
“ I had nearly reached the shore when one of
the men called out, reminding me that I had not
examined the hole to see what Peter had planted
there. I hart overlooked this. My God, what
dirt I see? There my little boy lay, his head
crushed, his body battered to pulp by a stone,
aye, twenty stones of my own throwing ”
Here the warders drew close behind him ready
for any emergency.
“I pulled the body out. Yes, it was he, my
beautiful Hubert, and I had murdered him, and
old Peter, too, who had put his body between the
child and my foul arm.”
He ceased, but not before the warders seized
him. His body writhed in agony as if a dozen
demons fought for its possession, and, old as he
was, his strength was terrific. It was only for a
few moments, then it looked as if one set of
demons had won, for with a bound he flung him-
self free from the men who held him ; then he
stood impassive—the horrible convulsion which
disturbed his face passed away.
“ IJe will remain,” said the warder, “just as
you see him for a little while ; then he will com-
mence his cry. His tale is perfectly true, and in
the other ward we have Joe Findlay, who tried
to steal the boy.”
Just as wo were about to move off, the old man
straightened himself and went to the commence-
ment of his track, moved five yard», paused, then
another five yards with another pause, and so to
the end of his track, returning in the same manner
to the point of starting, at every pause uttering
his horrible cry—“ Bee ! Bee ! ! Bee !!! ”
HENRY SIEBEL.
The Ace, from Snowy River.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
I had ridden over hurdles up the country once or
twice
By the side of River with a horse they
called The Ace,
And we brought him down to Sydney, and our
rider, Jimmy Rice,
Got a fall and broke his shoulder, so they nabbed
me in a trice—
Me that never wore the colours—for the Open
Steeplechase!
“ Make the running,” said the trainer, “ it’s your
only chance whatever—
Make it hot from start to finish, for the old
black horse can stay ;
And just think of hbw they’ll takedt when thty
hear on Snowy River
That the country boy was plucky and the country
horse was clever —
You must ride for old Monaro and the mountain
boys to-day.”
“ Are you ready ?” said the starter, as we held the
horses back
All a-blazing with impatience, with excitement
all aglow ;
And before us like a ribbon stretched the steeple-
chasing track.
And the sunrays glinted brightly on the chestnut
and the black
As the starter’s words came slowly—“ Are—
you—ready—Go !”
Well I scarcely knew we’d started, I was stupid-
like with wonder,
Till the field closed up beside me and a jump
appeared ahead,
And we charged it all together and it fairly
whistled under,
For we flew it like a hurdle, not a baulk and not a
blunder,
And then some were pulled behind me and the
rest shot out and led.
So we ran for half the distance, and I’m making
no pretences
When I'.tell you I was feeling very nervous-like
and queer,
For those jockeys rode like demons, you would
think they’d lost their senses
If you saw them rush their horses at those rasping
five-foot fences,
And in place of making running I was falling to
the rear;
Till a chap came racing past me on a horse they
called The Quiver,
And, said he, “ My country joker, are you going
to give it best ?
Are you frightened of the fences, does their stout-
ness make you shiver—
Have they took to breeding cowards by the side of
Snowy River?
Are there riders on Monaro?” —but I never
heard the rest.
For I drove the Ace and sent him just as fast as
he could pace it
At the big black line of timber stretching fair
across the track,
And he shot beside the Quiver. “Now,” says I,
“ my boy, we’ll race it,
You can come with Snowy River if you’re only
game to face it.
Let us mend the pace a little and we’ll see who
cries a crack.”
Then we raced away together, and we left the
others standing,
And the people howled and shouted as we settled
down to ride;
For I clung beside the Quiver —at his taking-off
and landing
I could watch his scarlet nostrils and his mighty
ribs expanding,
And the Ace stretched out in earnest, and we
held him stride for stride.
But the pace was so terrific that they soon ran out
their tether,
They were rolling in their gallop, they were
fairly blown and beat,
But they both were game as pebbles—neither one
would show the feather,
And we rushed them at their fences and they
cleared them both together,
Nearly every time they clouted but they some-
how kept their feet.
Then the last jump rose before us and they faced
it game as ever,
We were both at spur and whip-cord, fetching
blood at ev’ry bound,
And above the people’s cheering and theories cf
“Ace!” and “Quiver!”
I could hear the trainer shouting, “ One more run
for Snowy River,”
Then we struck the jump together and oamc
smashing to the ground.
Well, the Quiver ran to blazes, but the Ace stood
still and waited,
Stood and waited like a statue while I scrambled
on his back ;
There was no one next or near me, for the field
were fairly slated,
And I cantered home a winner with my shoulder
dislocated,
While the man that rode the Quiver followed
limping down the track.
And he shook my hand and told me that in all his
days he never
Met a man who rode more gamely and our last
set-to was prime.
And we wired them at Mpnaro how we chanced to
beat the Quiver,
And they sent us back an answer, “ Good old soit
from Snowy River,
Send us word each race you start in and we'll
'>ack you every time !”

The Cast-Iron Canvasser.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The firm of Sloper and Dodge, book-publishers
and printers, was in great distress. These two
enterprising individuals had worked up an
enormous business in time-payment books, which
they sold all over Australia by means of canvassers.
They had put a lot of money into the business—
all they had, in fact. And now, just as every-
thing was in thorough working order, the public
had revolted against them. Their canvassers
were ill-treated and molested by the country folk
in all sorts of strange bush ways. One man was
made drunk, and then a two-horse harrow was
run over him ; another was decoyed out into the
desolate ranges on pretence of being shown a
gold-mine, and then his guide galloped away and
left him to freeze all night in the bush. In mining
localities, on the appearance of a canvasser, the
inhabitants were called together by beating a
camp-oven lid with a pick, and the canvasser was
given ten minutes to leave the town alive. If he
disregarded the hint he would as likely as not fall
accidentally down a disused shaft. The people of
one district applied to their member of Parliament
to have canvassers brought under the “Noxious
Animals Act,” and demanded that a reward
should be offered for their scalps. Reports were
constantly published in the country press about
strange gigantic birds that appeared at remote
free selections, and frightened the inhabitants to
death —these were Sloper and Dodge’s sober and
reliable agents, wearing the neat, close-fitting
suits of tar and feathers, with which their enthusi-
astic yokel admirers had presented them. In fact-
it was too hot altogether for the canvassers, and
they came in from North and West and South,
crippled and disheartened, and handed in their
resignations. To make matters worse, Sloper and
Dodge had just got out a map of Australasia on a
great scale, and if they couldn’t sell it, ruin stared
them in the face; and how could they sell it with-
out canvassers!
The two members of the firm sat in their private
office. Sloper was a long, sanctimonious in-
dividual, very religious and very bald —“beastly,
awfully bald.” Dodge was a little, fat American,
with bristly black hair and beard, and quick, beady
eyes. He was eternally smoking a reeking black
pipe, and swallowing the smoke, and then puffing
it out through his nose in great whiffs, like a
locomotive on a steep grade. Anybody walking
into one of those whiffs incautiously was likely to
get paralysed, the tobacco was so strong.
As the firm waited, Dodge puffed nervously at
his pipe and filled the office with noxious fumes.
The two partners were in a very anxious and
expectant condition.
Just as things were at their very blackest, an
event had happened which promised to relieve all
their difficulties. An inventor, a genius, had
come forward, who offered to supply the firm with
a patent cast-iron canvasser, a figure which he
said when wound up would walk about, talk by
means of a phonograph, collect orders, and stand
any amount of ill-usage and wear and tear. If
this could indeed be done, then they were saved.
They had made an appointment with the genius
to inspect his figure, but he was half-an-hour late,
find the partners were steeped in gloom.
Just as they despaired of his appearing at all, a
cab rattled up to the door, and Sloper and Dodge
rushed unanimously to the'window. A young
man, very badly dressed, stepped out of the cab,
holding over his shoulder what looked like the
upper half of a man’s body. In his disengaged
hand he held a pair of human legs with boots and
trousers on. Thus equipped he turned to the cab-
man to ask his fare, but the man with a yell of
terror whipped up his horse, and disappeared at a
hand-gallop; and a woman who happened to be
going by, went howling down the street, saying
that “ Jack the Ripper ” had come to town. The
man bolted in at the door, and toiled up the dark
stairs tramping heavily under his hideous load,
the legs and feet which he dragged after him
making an unearthly clatter. He came in and
put bis burden down on the sofa.
“ There you are, gents,” he said ; “ there’s your
canvasser. ”
Sloper and Dodge recoiled in horror. The
upper part of the man had a waxy face, dull, fishy
eyes, and dark hair ; he lounged on the sofa like
a corpse at ease, while his legs and feet stood by,
leaning stiffly against the wall. The partners
looked at him for a while in silence, and felt like
two men haunted by a cast-iron ghost.
“ Fix him together for God’s sake,” said Dodge.
“ Don’t leave him like that—he looks awful.”
The genius grinned, and soon fixed the legs on.
“Now he looks better,” said Dodge, poking
about the figure—looks as much like life as most
ah, would you, you brute!” he exclaimed,
springing back in alarm, for the figure had made
a violent La Blanche swing at him.
“That’s all right,” said the genius, “that’s a
notion of my own. It’s no good having his face
knocked about, you know —lot of trouble to make
that face. His head and body are all full of con-
cealed springs, and if anybody hits him in the
countenance, or in the pit of the stomach —
favourite piace to hit canvassers, the pit of the
stomach it sets a strong spring in motion, and he
fetches his right hand r’ound with a swipe that’ll
knock them into the middle of next week. It’s
an awful hit. Griffo couldn’t dodge it, and Slavin
couldn’t stand against it. No fear of any man
hitting him twice. And he’s dog-proof too. His
legs are padded with tar and oakum, and if a dog
bites a bit out of him, it will take that dog the
rest of his life to pick his teeth clean. Never bite
anybody again, that dog won’t. And he’ll talk,
talk, talk, like a pious conference gone mad ; his
phonograph can be charged for 100,000 times, and
all you’ve got to do is to speak into it what you
want him to say, and he’ll say it. He’ll go on
saying it till he talks his man silly, or gets an
order. He has an order-form in his hand, and as
soon as anyone signs it and gives it back to him,
that sets another spring in motion, and he puts
the order in his pocket, turns round, and walks
away. Grand idea isn’t he? Lor’ bless you, I
fairly love him.”
Evidently he did, for as he spoke the genius
grinned affectionately at his monster.
“What about stairs?” said Dodge.
“No stairs in the bush,” said the inventor,
blowing a speck of dust off his apparition; “all
ground-floor houses. Anyhow, if there were
stairs we could carry him up and let him fall down
afterwards, or get flung down like any other
canvasser.”
“ Ha ! Let’s see him walk,” said Dodge.
The figure walked all right, stiff and erect.
“Now let’s hear him yabber,” was the next
order.
Immediately the genius touched a spring, and a
queer, tin-whistly voice issued from the creature’s
lips, and he began to sing, “ Little Annie
Rooney. ”
“Good!” said Dodge; “he’ll do. We’ll give
you your price. Leave him hero to-night, and
come in to-morrow, and we’ll start you off to some
place in the back country with him. Have a
cigar.”
And Mr. Dodge, much elated, sucked at his
pipe, and blew out thi-ough his nose a cloud of
nearly solid smoke, which hung and floated about
the door, and into which the genius walked as he
sidled off. It fairly staggered him, and they could
hea,r him sneezing and choking all the way down
stairs. Then they locked up the office, and made
for home leaving the figure in readiness for his
travels on the ensuing day.
# # »
Ninemile was a quiet little piace, sleepy beyond
description. When the mosquitoes in that town
settled on anyone, they usually went to sleep, and
forgot to bite him. The climate was so hot that
the very grasshoppers used to crawl into the hotel
parlors out of the sun. There they would climb
up the window curtains and go to sleep, and if
anybody disturbed them they would fly into his
eye with a great whizz, and drive the eye clean
out at the back of his head. There was no likeli-
hood of a public riot at Ninemile. The only thing
that could rouse the inhabitants out of their
lethargy was the prospect of a drink at somebody
else’s expense. And for those reasons it was
decided to start the canvasser in this forgotten
region, and then move him on to more populous
and active localities if he proved a success. They
sent up the genius, and a companion who knew
the district well. The genius was to manage the
automaton, and the other was to lay out the
campaign, choose the victims, and collect the
money, if they got any, geniuses being notoriously
unreliable and loose in their cash. They got
through a good deal of whisky on the way up, and
when they arrived at Ninemile, they were in a
cheerful mood, and disposed to take risks
“ Who’ll we begin on ? ” said the genius.
“Oh, d it,” said the other, “let’s start on
Macpherson,”
Macpherson was the big bug of the place. He
was a gigantic Scotchman, six feet four in his
socks, freckled all over with freckles as big as
half-crowns. His eyebrows would have made
decent-sized moustaches even for a cavalryman,
and his moustaches looked like horns. He was a
fighter, from the ground up, and, moreover, he
had a desperate “ down ” on canvassers generally,
and on Sloper and Dodge’s canvassers in parti-
cular. This eminent firm had once published a
book called “Remarkable Colonials,” and Mac-
pherson had written out his own biography for it.
He was intensely proud of his pedigree, and his
grand relations, and in his narrative made out
that he was descended from the original Pherson
or Fhairshon who swam round Noah’s Ark with
his title-deeds in his teeth. He showed how his
people had fought under Alexander the Great and
Timour, and had come over to England some
centuries before the Conqueror. He also proved
that he was related in a general way to one em-
peror, 15 kings, 25 dukes, and earls and lords and
viscounts innumerable. He dilated on the
splendour of the family estates in Scotland, and
the vast wealth of his relatives and progenitors.
And then, after all, Sloper and Dodge managed
to mix him up with some other fellow, some low-
bred Irish ruffian who drove a corporation cart!
Maopherson’s biography gave, it forth to the
astonished town that he was born in Dublin of
poor but honest parents, that his father when a
youth had lived by selling matches, until one day
he chanced to pick up a cigar-end, and, emboldened
by the possession of so much capital, had got
married, and the product was Macpherson.
It was a terrible outrage. Macpherson at once
became president for the whole of the Western
districts of the “Remarkable Colonials ’’Defence
League, the same being a fierce and homicidal
association got up to resist, legally and otherwise,
paying for the books. Also, he had sworn by all
he held sacred that every canvasser who came to
harry him in future should die, and he
had put up a notice on his office-door, “ Can-
vassers come in here at their own risk. ” He had
a dog which he called a dog of the “hold ’em”
breed, and this dog could tell a canvasser by his
walk, and would go for him on sight. The reader
will understand, therefore, that when the genius
and his mate proposed to start on Macpherson,
they were laying out a capacious contract for the
cast-iron canvasser, and were taking a step which
could only have been inspired by a morbid craving
for excitement, aided by the influence of back-
block whisky.
The genius wound the figure up in the back
parlour of the pub. There were a frightful lot of
screws to tighten before the thing would work,
but at last he said it was ready, and they shambled
off down the street, the figure marching stiffly
between them. It had a book stuck under its
arm and an order-form in its hand. When they
arrived opposite Macpherson’s office (he was a
land-agent and had a ground-floor room) the
genius started the phonograph working, pointed
the figure straight at Macpherson’s door, and set
it going, and then the two conspirators waited
like Guy Faux in his cellar.
The figure marched across the road and in at
the open door, talking to itself loudly in a hoarse,
unnatural voice.
Macpherson was writing at his table, and looked
up.
The figure walked bang through a small collec-
tion of flower-pots, sent a chair flying, tramped
heavily in the spittoon, and then brought up
against the table with a loud crash and stood
still. It was talking all the time.
“ I have here,” it said, “a most valuable work,
a map and geography of Australia, which I desire
to submit to your notice. The large and increas-
ing demand of bush residents for time-payment
works has induced the publishers of this ”
“My God!” said Macpherson, “it’s a can-
vasser. Here, Tom Sayers, Tom Sayers !” and
he whistled and called for the dog. “Now,” he
said, “will you go out of this office quietly, or
will you be thrown out ? It’s for yourself to
decide, but you’ve only got while a duck wags his
tail to decide in. Which’ll it be?”
“works of modern ages,” said the can-
vasser. “Every person subscribing to this in-
valuable work will receive, in addition, a flat-
iron, a railway-pass for a year, and a pocket-
compass. If you will please sign this order ”
Jnst here Tom Sayers., the bulldog, came tearing
through the office, and, without waiting for orders,
hitched straight on to the calf of the canvasser’s
leg. To Macpherson’s intense amazement the
piece came clear away, and Tom Sayers rolled
about the floor with his mouth full of some sticky
substance which seemed to surprise him badly.
The long Scotchman paused awhile before this
mystery, but at last he fancied he had got the
solution. “ Got a cork leg, have you?” said he—
“ well, let’s see if your ribs are cork, too,” and he
struck the canvasser a terrific blow on the fifth
button of the waistcoat.
Quicker than the lightning’s flash came that
terrific right-handed cross-counter. It was so
quick that Macpherson never even knew what
happened to him. He remembered striking his
blow, and afterwards all was a blank, As a
matter of fact, the canvasser’s right hand, which
had been adjusted by the genius for a high blow,
landed just on the butt of Macpherson’s ear and
dropped him like a fowl. The gasping and terri-
fied bull-dog fled from the scene, and the can-
vasser stood over his fallen foe and droned on
about the virtues of his publication, stating that
he had come there merely as a friend, and to give
the inhabitants of Ninemile a chance to buy a
book which had already earned the approval of
Dan. O’Connor and the Earl of Jersey.
The genius and his mate watched this extra-
ordinary drama through the window. They had
kept up their courage with whisky and other
stimulants, and now looked upon the whole affair
as a wildly hilarious joke.
“By Gad! he’s done him,” said the genius as
Macpherson went down, “done him in one hit.
If he don’t pay as a canvasser I’ll take him to
town and back him to fight Joe Goddard. Look
out for yourself ; don’t you handle him ! ” he con-
tinued as the other approached the figure. “Leave
him to me. As like as not, if you get fooling
about him, he’ll give you a smack in the snout
that’ll paralyze you.”
So saying, he guided the automaton out of the
office and into the street, and walked straight into
—a policeman.
By a common impulse the genius and his mate
at once ran rapidly away in different directions,
and left the figure alone with the officer.
He was a fully-ordained sergeant —by name
Aloysius O’Grady : a squat, rosy little Irishman.
He hated violent arrests and all that sort of thing,
and had a faculty of persuading drunks and dis-
orderlies and other fractious persons to “go
quietly along with him,” that was little'short of
marvellous. Excitable revellers, who were being
carried along by their mates, struggling violently,
would break away from their companions, and
prance gaily along to the lock-up with the ser-
geant, whom, as likely as not, they would try to
kiss on the way. Obstinate ch’unks who would
do nothing but lie on the ground and kick their
feet in the air, would get up like birds, serpent-
charmed, and go with him to durance vile. As
soon as he saw the canvasser, and noted his fixed,
unearthly stare, and listened to his hoarse, un-
natural voice, he knew what was the matter —it
was a man in the horrors, a common enough
spectacle at Ninemile. The sergeant resolved to
decoy him into the lock-up, and accosted him in a
friendly and free-and-easy way.
“ Good day t’ye,” he said.
“ Most magnificent volume ever published,
jewelled in fourteen holes, working on a ruby
roller, and in a glass case,” said the book-can-
vasser. “The likenesses of the historical per-
sonages are so natural that the book must not be
left open on the table, or the mosquitoes will
ruin it by stinging the faces of the portraits.”
It then dawned on the sergeant that he was
dealing with a book-canvasser.
“Ah sure,” he said, “fwhat’s the use of tryin’
to sell books at all, at all, folks does be peltin’
them out into the street, and the nanny-goats lives
on them these times. I sent the childher out to
pick ’em up, and we have ’em at my place now—
barrow-loads of ’em. Come along wid me now,
and I’ll make you nice and comfortable for the
night,” and he laid his hand on the outstretched
palm of the figure.
It was a fatal mistake. By so doing he set in
motion the machinery which operated the figure’s
left arm, and it moved that limb in towards its
body, and hugged the sergeant to its breast, with
a vice-like grip. Then it started in a faltering,
and uneven, but dogged way to walk towards the
steep bank of the river, carrying the sergeant
along with it.
“ Immortial Saints ! ” gasped the sergeant,
“ he’s squazin the livin’ breath out of me. Lave
go now loike a dacent sowl, lave go. And oh, for
the love of God, don’t be shpakin’ into my ear
that way ; ” for the figure’s mouth was pressed
tight against the sergeant’s ear, and its awful
voice went through and through the little man’s
head, as it held forth about the volume. The
sergeant struggled violently, and by so doing set
some more springs in motion, and the figure’s
right arm made terrific swipes in the air. A
following of boys and loafers had collected by this
time. “ Ely me, how he does lash out!” was the
admiring remark they made. But they didn’t
altogether like interfering, notwithstanding the
sergeant’s frantic appeals, and things would have
gone hard with him had his subordinate constable
Dooley, not appeared on the scene.
Dooley, better known to the town boys as “ the
Wombat,” from his sleepy disposition, was a man
of great strength. He had originally been quar-
tered at Redfern, Sydney, and had fought many
bitter battles with the “BondiPush,” the “Black
Red Push,” and the “Surry Hills Push.” After
this the duty at Ninemile was child’s play, and he
never ran in less than two drunks at a time ; it
was beneath his dignity to be seen capturing a
solitary inebriate. If they wouldn’t come any
other way, he would take them by the ankles
and drag them after him. The townsfolk would
have cheerfully backed him to arrest John L.
Sullivan if necessary; and when he saw the
sergeant in the grasp of an inebriate he bore down
on the fray full of fight.
“ I’ll soon make him lave ye go, sergeant,” he
said, and he tried to catch hold of the figure’s
right arm, to put on the “police twist.” Un-
fortunately at that exact moment the sergeant’s
struggles touched one of the springs in the crea-
ture’s breast with more than usual force. With
the suddenness and severity of a horse-kick, it
lashed out with its right hand, catching the
redoubtable Dooley a regular thud on the jaw,
and sending him to grass, as if he had been
shot. For a few minutes he “lay as only
dead men lie.” Then he got up bit by bit,
and wandered off home to the police-barracks,
and mentioned casually to his wife that
John L. Sullivan had come to town, and had
taken the sergeant away to drown him. After
which, having given orders that if anybody called
that visitor was to be told he had gone out of
town fifteen miles to serve a summons on a man
for not registering a dog, he locked himself into a
cell for the rest of the day.
Meanwhile, the canvasser, still holding the ser-
geant tightly clutched to its breast, was marching
straight towards the river. Something had dis-
organised the voice-arrangements, and it was now
positively shrieking at the sergeant’s ear, and, as
it yelled, the little man yelled louder : “ I don’t
want yer accursed book. Lave go of me, I say !”
He beat with his fists on its face, and kicked at its
shins without the slightest avail. A short, stag-
gering rush, a wild shriek from the officer, and the
two of them toppled over the steep bank and went
souse into the bottomless depths of the Ninemile
Creek.
That was the end of the whole matter. The
genius and his mate returned to town hurriedly,
and lay low, expecting to be indicted for murder.
Constable Dooley drew up a report for the Chief
of Police, which contained so many strange and
unlikely statements that the department concluded
the sergeant must have got drunk and drowned
himself, and that Dooley saw him do it, but was
too drunk to pull him out. Anyone unacquainted
with Ninemile would have expected that a report
of the occurrence would have reached the Sydney
papers. As a matter of fact the storekeeper did
think about writing a report, but decided that it
was too much trouble. There was some idea of
asking the Government to fish the two bodies out
of the river, but about that time an agitation was
started in Ninemile to have the Federal Capital
located there, and the other thing was forgotten.
The genius drank himself to death ; the “Wom-
bat ” became Sub-Inspector of Police ; and a vague
tradition about “a bloke who came up here in
the horrors, and drownded poor old O’Grady,” is
the only memory that remains of that wonderful
creation, the cast-iron canvasser.
As for the canvasser himself there is a rusted
mass far down in the waters of the creek, and in
its arms it holds a skeleton dressed in the rags of
what was once a police uniform. And on calm
nights the passers-by sometimes imagine they can
hear, rising out of the green and solemn depths, a
husky, slushy voice, like that of an iron man with

THE BANJO.
Where the Dead Men Lie.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Out on the wastes of the “ Never, Never,”
That’s where the dead men lie,
There where the heat-waves dance for ever.
That’s where the dead men lie;
That’s where the earth’s lov’d sons are keeping
Endless tryst —not the west wind sweeping
Feverish pinions, can wake their sleeping—
Out where the dead men lie.
Where brown Summer and Death have mated,
That’s where the dead men lie,
Loving with fiery lust unsated,
That’s where the dead men lie ;
Out where the grinning skulls bleach whitely,
Under the saltbush sparkling brightly,
Out where the wild dogs chorus nightly,
That’s where the dead men lie.
Deep in the yellow, flowing river,
That’s where the dead men lie,
Under its banks where the shadows quiver,
That’s where the dead men lie ;
While the platypus twists and doubles,
Leaving a train of tiny bubbles ;
Rid at last of their earthly troubles,
That’s where the dead men lie.
East and backward pale faces turning,
That’s how the dead men lie;
Gaunt arms stretched with a voiceless yearning,
That’s how the dead men lie.
Oft in the fragrant hush of nooning,
Hearing again their mothers’ crooning,
Wrapt for aye in a dreamful swooning,
Tha*t’s how the dead men lie.
Nought but the hand of night can free them ;
That’s when the dead men fly ;
Only the frightened cattle see them—
See the dead men go by ;
Cloven hoofs beating out one measure,
Bidding the stockman know no leisure,
That’s where the dead men take their pleasure,
That’s when the dead men fly.
Ask too, the never sleeping drover,
He sees the dead pass by,
Hearing them call to their friends—the plover,
Hearing the dead men cry.
Seeing their faces stealing, stealing,
Hearing their laughter pealing, pealing,
Watching their grey forms wheeling, wheeling
Round where the cattle lie.
Strangled by thirst and fierce privation,
That’s how the dead men die
Out on “ Moneygrub’s ” furthest station,
That’s how the dead men die ;
Hardfaced greybeards, youngsters callow,
Some mounds cared for, others fallow,
Some deep down, yet others shallow,
Some having but the sky.
“Moneygrub,” as he sips his claret
Looks with complacent eye
Down at his watohchain, eighteen-carat,
There, in the club, hard by ;
Reeks not that every link is stamped with
Names of the men whose limbs are cramped with
Too long lying in grave mould, camped with
Death where the dead men lie.
SURCINGLE.
To Messrs. Colemane and Sons, Coota-
mundra. Gentlemen, —Eight or nine years ago
my wife injured her right wrist by a fad. None
of the medical men to whom she showed it
appeared to know what was really wrong with it,
and all the remedies applied seemed to be insuffi-
cient. She continued to use various remedies
until six months ago, when the hand and wrist
became ulcerated nearly to the elbow from the
knuckles, and each time the dressing was removed
the skin was torn off with it, and it was feared
she would be obliged to have her arm amputated.
At the same time her general health was so im-
paired by constant suffering and loss of rest, and
an affection of the lungs, which had reduced her
to a mere skeleton, that she had been unable to
leave the house for thirteen weeks, gradually sink-
ing until scarcety able to speak articulately, and
only kept up by spoonfuls of brandy administered
now and then; unable to sleep at night without also
taking brandy, which only gave rest for about an
hour. Theclergyman, imagining she could only last
a few days, read the prayers for the dying. I heard,
through Mrs. James Brown, your Lake Bathurst
agent, of your Eucalypte Extract and Victory
Ointment, but Mrs. B. at the same time stated she
feared my wife was too far gone for cure. How-
ever, I tried it, and from them, and from the time
my wife began to take the Extract and use the
Ointment she gradually rallied, until she had re-
covered her usual health, and three weeks ago she
was able to drive into Lake Bathurst, a distance
of 10 miles, and her arm is so well that she can write
letters and do sewing, both of which were matters
of impossibility for some months past. All pain
even has ceased, only a slight redness remains,
which is gradually passing off. She still continues
taking the Extract and using the Ointment. I
consider this one of the most wonderful testi-
monies to your Eucalypte Extract and Ointment.
Make whatever use you like of this statement. —
Ohas. G. Smith, Public School, Mullengullenga,
Near Lake Bathurst. We, the undersigned,
believe the above to be a true account of Mrs.
Smith’s case.—J. A. Newth, Clerk in Holy
Orders; Frederick D. Badgery, J.P. ; Sarah
Brown. Beware of frauds, see that each bottle
bears our signature, Colemane & Sons.

Literary Competitions.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
I’ve just been expelled from the Human-
milk Club, of Notick-street, Tangletown. I want
to tell my troubles.
• * •
Literary competitions are of many breeds,
but they have nearly all the same father and
mother—Swindle and Oof.
There is the gentle offer of <£49,000 for calculat-
ing how, many words can be fashioned out of
“ Cumalonginanavadrink.” That’s easy, but, as
easy as it is, the prize usually falls down a slot-
hole behind the scenes. That kind of thing is, of
course, a raffle, at a shilling a head, and though
there are just 980,000 shillings in <£49,000, and a
population of 173| in the town where the raffle is
organised, there are goslings plenty on the spot to
go in for it. and the post-office does the rest.
# # #
Then there is the Good-ad-for-the-paper
competition. That generally takes the form of
three prizes of <£82,000, <£lB,ooo, and 625., respec-
tively, for the best Christmas story, or poem, or
conundrum. Sometimes the “ three best stories ”
are written up “in the office,” beforehand; but
not often. For this class of offer can stand on its
own bottom. For <£100,003-25.-Od. -worth of
prizes, just about 96 millions of trusting fools
compete, so that the enterprising prize giver gets
96 millions of well-meant attempts at literature—
and a failure can always be polished up and made
fit—for justed, apiece (discarding the 625.). See
it? These stories duly appear, but their gifted
authors get nothing but glory—a quill through a
heart!
* # #
There is another style of competition on
similar motor-principles, but worked in this way ;
An advertisement appears counselling persons
bubbling over with literary or artistic fancies to
introduce themselves by letter to “X.P., Box
0009, G.P.0.,” and they will, if found capable, be
placed in the way of doing that class of work, at
home, if preferred, or at a large city office, with
trreat chances of a good, permanent billet at a
thousand a week.
About 999 trusting geniuses apply, and they
promptly receive a printed circular from X.P.,
with about 72 conditions in small type.
X.P. desires Galoot to send him “specimens”
of his skill in about a million things—say, four
specimens to each of the million. These comprise
such things as—ldeas for advertisements, para-
graphs of (say) ten lines; ditto, quatrains of
verse (!); also, catch-headings and specimen
“Dumpling’s Dough - Tightener ” cross-headed
pars, up to (say) half-a-column ; also, a “contor-
tionist” sample or two —the advt. that twists
itself sideways, or stands on its head, or loses its
stomach, or has its toes in its mouth, or twists
itself into a circus serpent-man, or—but you see
the whole idea.
Galoot is asked to do about <£lo worth of
literary work, and supply it as samples on approval!
He is told that he will be paid for all work
accepted, and, if his style suits, he may get a per-
manent billet at a good salary.
Now, much of his work may be accepted, and
yet he may never know it, unless he sees the
Chinese papers, or the street hoardings of Tim-
buctoo!
This is the tallest Confidence Trick I ever
collided with.
Of course, Mr. Galoot probably will see any
locally-used of his “ samples,” and the firm always
pays up, which renews his confidence. But what
a big job it is ! The worst kind of literary
“ sweating.” Tailoresses are not in it with this.
Will it be believed that scores of people send in
their “samples,” and such a firm flourishes
mightily ? Fact.
* # #
Talking of “ samples,” I know a com-
mercial traveller who, whenever ho is “ stone-
broke ” and thirsty—he’s always thirsty but
occasionally not dead-smashed—goes to his various
firms and asks for “ samples,” as he “thinks he
can place certain lines, if the quotation prices are
not too steep. ”
Drummers never reveal “where” they can
place goods, because that would enable the boss to
run the thing on his own account and save the
commission to the drummer. So you see how
easy this trick is.
Drummer gets his “samples” and promptly
“places” them by selling them to—well—any-
body. This drummer once sold mo about 61b. of
tea, for the price of “two drinks.” The 61b. was
made up of “screws” of about a score of
“samples.” Drummer had blended them all
together, from the 3s. supergood to the ninepenny
muck. The blend made the vilest decoction that
even I ever drank, and I have drunk mixed-scents
to run out a bush spree. However, I gave it to a
poor widow washerwoman, and she’s always
asking me for more I
But this is not concerning literary competitions.
* * #
Nor is it concerning how I, a late Deacon
of the Rumanmilk Club, know not Notick-street
more. Which brings me to my tale of woe.
I noticed recently that an English paper had
offered a £lOOO prize for the best metrical conun-
drum, and that the prize had been given to the
vilest trash even a school-child could construct
out of parrot-talk, Kanakee and Yolapuk mixed.
Of course, I recognised my old familiar friend—
the readied-up-in-the-orfice.
Now, the Rumanmilk Club has an Organ
named the Setumup Agen Mixer, of which I was’
until the other day, Editor. It is a small sheet’
confined to Rumanrnilkers, and partly type-
written—when the Caligraph is sober, which is
seldom—-but mostly written out by hand in beer
1 was hard driven to pay for “The Staffs’”
next week’s c ellarage expenses, so I put up a con-
fidence swindle.
In that night’s Mixer appeared this advertise-
ment :
PRIZE! £5! PRIZE!
The editor of the Mixer desires to delight the Rum-
anmilkers with Good News.
A Kind Friend has offered a £5 Prize for the beat
ba nU d rUm * rom ® ,umanm hkers only ; Editor Dipso.
Conditions ; Each effort to be original, no Mixerer
to assist another ; Mixerers are not limited to one try,
but each try entails the conditional fee; the Conun-
drum is to be in the form of two quatrains, one to be
tne Question, the other the answer.
Subject; “A Morning Anthem,” suitable to our cir-
cumstances.
Entrance-fee for each competitor, 2s. 6d.
Avmner to set ’em up for one round, and to receive
all fees (if any) over the £5.

Gintun —grand old “ booner ” (copyright;
—was my confederate. I readied-up a regular
blazer and handed it to Gintun to copy out in his
own beer scrawl.
I was the sole judge. *
. How the idea took ! How the boys went away
into mysterious recesses, and splashed pens into
beer-wells, and hid away their “copy” if any
other approached them!
-There were 164 competitors, and nearly all of
them better than mine—l mean Gintun’s.
But 1 was the sole judge.
There was a full house that night, and I read
out all the losers’ first; we roared, and as cf
course there was to be a “set-up all round,” we
ordered the drinks in advance. I felt easy—l 64
half-crowns ! £2O 10s. ! !
Hie boys chaffed or applauded or criticised, as
they pleased. The tone of their remarks was
generally to the effect that, “if all these good uns
v ere losers, what a prime clincher the winner’s
would be! ”
At last it came : “ I declare .Jerry Gintun our
.Laureate Con undrummer.”
e silence became suddenly grievous, and I
co “-id scarcely make a start for nervousness.
Read ! read ! give us it, Dipso.”
I his was the wretched thing, read out as boldly
as I could
“ Mixer Morning Anthem ” Competition.
Q- Blend the bugjuice with the dugjuice,
Fill the goblet to the brim ;
I rom the drug-juice of the jug-juice,
Can you name the “ Morning Hymn ? ”
-A. Mix the row-juice with the cow-juice,
And the Riddle fails to bilk ;
Plain the how-juice of the now-juice—
Morning Anthem—“ Rumanmilk.”
(Signed ) Jeremiah Gintun,
Sole Author.
What a how-d’ye-do was there! But, after a
bit of appealing to the effect that order and
dignity and the high reputation of the club would
* ;>e cruinbled. into chaos if hon. members did not
u Pho| c l their President, and accept the verdict of
the Sole Judge, for which they were referred to
the contract conditions, they subsided like good
boys, and became even sceptical of the value of
their critical poetical judgment.
I paid over the prize to Gintun, crowned him
with a chaplet framed out of whisky-labels, dubbed
him 1 oet Laureate and Champion Conundrum-
mer, hoisted him on to a cask and placed the
insignia of office in his hand—a corkscrew.
The revels proceeded gloriously. But time’s
up, and I must cut it short.
•Terry Gintun got so drunk that he lost his dis-
cretion and roared out suddenly—
Shay, Shole Shush, dear ole Dippy, wenyer
coming for your share sher divvy ? It mightn’t be
safe with me, yer know, hie !”
This was Sheol.
How I got out, I don’t know. X left part of my
raiment and features behind me. And all the
dividend!
How Jerry fared I never learned, and I sha’n’t
try to. Next day a Special Meeting of the Rum-
anmilk Club formally expelled me, and advised
me to go to the Devil or a parson, they didn’t care
which.
So I came here.
Which am I with?
THE DIPSOMANIAC.
The Bachelor’s Pudding.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
“ O ! take away that pudding with the holly in
its breast—
I have done with festive seasons, and my
stomach seeketh rest.
This life, says poet Gilbert, is a pudding full of
plums,
But we only taste the suet when the sad to-
morrow comes.
0 ! take away the pudding, for its odour
makes me sigh, 1
And it looks so like the puddings of the years
that hurried by—
The years when one was merry and a fellow’s
friends were young,
And the “fling” was just beginning that so
long ago was flung.
“ 0 ! take away the pudding ; round my table
now are ghosts
Making simple, kindly speeches in proposing
Christmas toasts ;
I bend to catch a whisper and my brain goes
whirling round
To the music of a love that lies a-mould’ring in
the ground.
“ But the little hand I’m pressing, it is growing
icy cold,
And my heart has finished throbbing with the
fever-throb of old ;
The visions fade and vanish, and the calloras
Present seems
To be mocking at the Future of those unfulfilled
dreams.
“ Remove that wretched pudding to the kitchen,
if you please—
(Let me end my sad reflections with a bit of
bread and cheese),
For a bachelor of fifty wants no English Christ-
mas fare
To remind him of the winter that is frosting
o’er his hair.
“ You eat the pudding, Mary, there’s a happy
month, they say,
In the slice of each new sample that a girl can
put away :
I’ve tested many samples, ah ! and happy
months I’ve had,
But the time that this would bring me would
be very, very sad.
“So, take away the pudding ere it cools upon
the dish ;
What’s that you say—one mouthful will entitle
me to wish ?
That prospect shan’t beguile me into tasting it —■
and, yet,
I will try just a mouthful, and I’ll wish I may
forget. ”

MDMUND FISHER.
Two Mountains.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Midway in the Southern Island one white
mountain stands alone,
High in heaven his peak arises, like some sacred
altar-stone,
Climbing, climbing all around the ancient woods
close, still, and dark,
Far below the village sparkles, harvest-field
and grassy park ;
When with silv’ry steps the morning move B
across the ocean floor,
Then one solid cone of shadow purples all that
leafy shore;
In the valley shade the settler looks toward his
moon-swept peak,
Out at sea the weary sailor watches for its
pallid streak,
And at midnight, when the star-tides bring
the blessed Christmas morn,
Distant sounds of church-bells ringing tell the
mount that Christ is born.
But the mountain listens sadly, for in some far
southern land,
O’er the blue, deserted surges, by the wild
Antarctic strand,
One great brother-mount arises, twin-shape to
this snowy spire,
In that white, dead world still bearing flames
of some undying fire ;
No fair vineyard clings beside him, no green
forest whispers round,
Not a roof-tree seeks his shelter, never sail
shines homeward-bound;
But the sheeted snow-field glitters, and the
glacier fount abides.
And the shooting meteor crackles, and the
moon in glory rides ;
There he watches, calm and lonely, keeping
still his altar ’light,
Like the pillar-cloud by daytime and the
pillar-fire by night.
Sometimes there the wide-winged sea-bird,
storm-belated, wandering guest,
Sends a cry far into silence, echoing to his icy
breast.
>Tis a word from lands where summer sighs
through leafy barricades,
Clover fields and blossomed orchards, tossing
trees, and latticed glades,
Then the mountain hears the message, and with
fiery streamers, thus
Answers to the secret greeting Egmont sends
to Erebus.
But no choir nor psalmist cheers him, or, across
the fields forlorn,
No far sound of church-bells ringing tells the
mount that Christ is born.

ANNIE GLENNY WILSON.
* After Heine.
To Messrs. Colemane and Sons, Cootamundra.—
Dear Sirs, —I have used the Euoalypte Extract
which I got from you, and am now quite out of it.
Almost every complaint I use it for, including
burns, scalds, outs, bruises, sore throats, colds,
chilblains, neuralgia, toothache, &c., and I do not
believe there is any complaint it will not cure if
persevered with. In ulcerated sore throat or
inflamed throat it is invaluable, hiving had
personal experience of the fact very recently.
Where children or even adults are badly affected
I usually erect a kind of small tent near a fire-
place, place a kettle on the fire, and when the
water reaches boiling point I pour a quantity of
sthe Euoalypte Extract into the kettle, and attach
a long tube to the spout of the kettle, and make
the steam play about the patient in the tent.
The steam, owing to the distance which it has to
travel, when it reaches the patient is thus in a
■cool form and is not enervating like hot steam.
The whole atmosphere in the tent in this manner
becomes impregnated with the volatile properties
•of the Extract, and the patient is not only
relieved but stimulated. I have by this means
■saved the life of one of my children when the
medical attendants said that the only means of
saving the child’s life would be by performing the
■operation of tracheatomy. In diphtheria I would
adopt similar treatment with the addition of
swabbing the tonsils and glottis frequently with
the Extract on a camel’s hair brush or feather.
Nearly everyone hero now uses it. —Faithfully
yours, J. C. Ryall, Editor Cowra Fhkr Prkss.

Jack Denver died on Talbragar when Christmas
Eve began,
And there was sorrow round the place, for Denver
Was “ a man ”;
Jack Denver’s wife bowed down her head —her
daughters’ grief was wild ;
And big Ben Duggan by the bed was sobbing like
a child.
But big Ben Duggan saddled up and galloped
fast and far
To raise tr. 3 biggest funeral e’er seen on Tal-
bragar.
By station home,
And shearing shed,
Ben Duggan cried, “ Jack Denver’s dead !
Roll up at Talbragar !”
He borrowed horses here and there and rode all
Christinas Eve,
And scarcely paused a moment’s time the mourn-
ful news to leave ;
He rode by lonely huts and farms, and when the
CJay was done
He turned his panting horse’s head and rode to
Ross’s Run.
No bushman in a single day had ridden half so
far
Since Johnson brought the doctor to his wife at
Talbragar.
By digger’s camps
Ben Duggan sped
At each he cried, “Jack Denver’s dead !
Roll up at Talbragar !”
That night he passed the humpies of the splitters
on the ridge,
And roused die bullock-drivers camped at Lallan*
faulie’s Bridge ;
And as he climbed the ridge again the moon rose
on the rise,
The soft white moonbeams glistened in the tears
that filled his eyes ;
He dashed the rebel drops away—for blinding
things they are
But ’twas his best and truest friend who died on
Talbragar.
At Blickman’s Run
Before the dawn
Ben. Duggan cried, “ Poor Denver's gone.
Roll up at Talbragar !”
At all the shanties round the place they’d heard
his horse’s tramp,
He took the track to “Wilson’s Luck ” and told
the diggers’ camp ;
But in the gorge by Deadman’s Gap the mountain
shades were black,
And there a newly-fallen tree was lying on the
track —
lie saw too late, and then he heard the swift hoof’s
sudden jar,
And big Ban. Duggan ne’er again rode home to
Talbragar.
“Tne wretch is drunk,
And Denvers dead—
A burning shame !” the people said
Next day at Talbragar.
For thirty miles round Talbragar the boys rolled
up in strength,
And Denver had a funeral a good long mile in
length ;
Round Denver’s grave that Christmas day, rough
bushmen’’* eyes were dim.
The western bushmen know the way to bury dead
like him ;
But some returning homewards found, by light of
moon and star,
Ben Duggan dying in the rocks, five miles from
Talbragar.
They knelt around,
He raised his head
And faintly gasped, “Jack Denver’s dead,
Roll up at Talbragar !”
But one short hour before he died he woke and
understood,
They told him, when he asked them, that the
funeral was good ;
And then there came into his eyes a strange
victorious light,
He smiled on them in triumph, and his great soul
took its flight.
And still the careless bushmen tell by tent and
shanty bar
How Duggan raised a funeral, years back on
Talbragar.
And far and wide
When Duggan died,
The bushmen of the western side,
Rode in to Talbragar.

THE HORSE-DRIVER’S COFFIN.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
When Jem, the horse-driver, meets the
Doctor he usually scowls and passes by, and when
the Doctor sees Jem in
the distance he rpostly
crosses to the other side
of the road. For there is
a coolness between them,
and it came about over
a coffin. It was not
much of a coffin, after
all. Metal-lined, clasped
mahogany boxes are not
considered indispensable
at Tellabindah (Never
Never), and this was
only a very ordinary affair
of plain hardwood, and
six feet six inches long.
It was a back-blocks
hospital coffin. But it
was the making of it and
the paying for it that led
to the trouble.
Jem was horse-driver
at Talumba, 20 miles
away. He had been 15
years in the district, with
a regular spree every six
months, which caused
the entire township to
feel a fraternal interest in
his fate, when one morning, stretched on a blan-
ket on the station dray, Jem came into the Tella-
bindah Hospital. Six-feet-four long, and always
thin and bilious-looking, Jem seemed more
cadaverous than usual this morning. It was
fever, and, as he held an impromptu levee of the
leading residents in front of the Diggers’ Arms
where the dray had made a temporary stoppage to
refresh man and beast, the opinion was freely
expressed that it was “as near as a toucher with
poor Jem this time.”
There were three patients in the hospital when
Jem arrived. They had not then and had never
had anything particular the matter with them,
but the view from the verandah was rather fine,
and it was pleasant to be able to propound their
symptoms at length once a day, and to be visited
by the committee and asked if there were any
complaints, and work was rather scarce—not that
they had any particular desire for it. So they
were resting for a while in a land where it seemed
always afternoon. They viewed the arrival of the
dray with languid interest, doubting whether this
might not lead to sitting up at night with the sick
man, and also indulging in speculations as to a
probable greater liberality in the dispensing of
medical comforts.
To the Doctor the matter was more important,
for he had not had a really sick patient for three
months, and some ill-natured people had even
gone so far as to insinuate that it was no use
paying him a salary to look after three convalescent
sundowners. This touched the Doctor on the
raw—to wit, his pocket, so when, accompanied
by the king of Tellabindah, who was also the
local storekeeper, likewise a J.P., and whose name
was Murphy, he visited Jem, he pronounced the
ease to be one of great danger, indeed.
Now, this was not wise of the Doctor, for
though Jem looked ill, he was not really so ill
as he looked. He always looked ill. But the
Doctor did not know this. He was a foreign
gentleman, with a foreign diploma, which his
enemies asserted he had obtained by garotting
the rightful owner. This, of course, in a whisper,
for the Doctor was not only a choleric man,
but a very strong man, with outlandish but
effective methods of personal combat, as a
customer who declined to part with the usual
professional fee discovered to his cost. But
having formally given his opinion he considered
the matter settled, and it was generally under-
stood that Jem was going to “pass in his cheques.”
But Jem took a different view of the matter,
and held forth to Dennis Flaherty (Dennis was
one of the patients alluded to and fetched Jem’s
tobacco on the sharing system.)
“ I had this ’ere blessed fever more nor 15 years
ago on the Palmer, and a dashed sight worse, too.
This little touch ain't a goin’ to kill me. If the
old cove ’ud only leave off punchin’ an’ proddin’
an’ examinin’ of me I’d bs all right by now,” and
Dennis who was nothing if not sympathetic said :
“ Shure, an’ you’ll be all roight directly, Jem.”
Jem was on plenty of quinine with a strictly
milk diet, which, together with the lying in bed,
made him look thinner and more cadaverous than
ever, so the Doctor thought he was worse, and
said one morning that he was sure he could not
live many days longer, which being repeated
generally caused a pleasurable thrill of excitement
through the township.
There is not a medical man living who does not
take it as a personal insult when a patient, who is
ordered to recover, dies, or vice versa, and when
the Doctor had, on several distinct occasions, pro-
nounced it impossible for Jem to live, and Jem,
although getting thinner and thinner, still refused
to fall in with the verdict, the Doctor felt himself
aggrieved, for he thought himself infallible, and
liked to be thought so too.
There was only one carpenter, who was also the
undertaker, in Tellabindah. Name, Simmons.
He had listened sympathetically to the account of
Jem’s serious state. His ordinary contract was “to
find everything and do everything at £3 10s. a
body.” But surely a friendly committee would
take into consideration the fact of a Cft. Gin. coffin
being required and make an allowance for extra
timber? Besides, Jem had taken his two sprees a
year regularly for fifteen years, which should be
an inducement to the leading residents to provide
a few extra “fittings” for such a consistent
citizen.
So one morning Simmons called on the Doctor.
“ Suppose there ain’t no chance of Jem getting
better ! ” he said.
Now, the more obstinate the patient was in
refusing to die, the more obstinate became that
foreign Doctor ’« his opinion, so he said ;
“No.”
“ Well, Doctor,” said Simmons, “ it’s very
awkward, but I’ve got to go away for a week and
if aught was to happen there’d be nobody to make
the coffin, an’ no one ’ud like to see poor Jem
buried without a coffin. Hadn't I better make it
now?"
The Doctor did not like this at all. It was
unusual and, what was worse, unprofessional.
But what could a man who had been so positive in
his opinion do ? Should no coffin be forthcoming,
they would blame him for want of foresight. So
Simmons took away the order, with a promise of
fds
“The Doctor was sure Jem would not live much longer."
secrecy.
Late in the afternoon, when the patient awoke,
Denis Flaherty was sitting beside him.
. “Jem,” he said, “do you know what that noise
is? It was the knock, knock, knock of a carpen-
ter’s hammer. “ Shure,” he continued, “ it’s that
z£=: f
“No one 'ud like to see poor Jem buried without a coffin. Hadn't I letter make it now?"
d——d thafe of a Simmons, an’ he’s building a
coffin for yez.”
Jem was ill and Jem was weak, but he sat bolt-
upright in the bed.
“ By gum !” was all he said.
“ I heard them awhiles
ago whin I was makin’
pritence to slape forninst
the verandah,” continued
Dennis, “ an’ I’ll tell
ye, thrue by the Howly
Father, unless ye clear
out av this, that ould
divil when lie gets the
coffin won't stand ye dis-
appointin’ av him much
longer."
* * #
It was after dark
when Jem cleared out of
the Tellabindah Hos-
pital, and, weak as he
was, he managed to
tramp by easy stages
back to the men’s huts at
Talumba. The coffin had
cured the fever.
# # #
At the next meeting
of the Hospital Com-
mittee a sad-eyed un-
dertaker presented, with
a doubtful air, a little
bill for “one extra-long
hardwood coffin, as per
contract, two pounds.”
The committee smiled
disdainfully and referred
him to the medical
officer, but as the med cal
officer had just shut him-
self up with his second
bottle of whisky, the un-
dertaker preferred, after
reconnoitring through
the window, to postpone
the interview.
A month later on Jem,
who was at work again,
received the following
account :
J dr. to VV. simmons.
To one extra long hard Wood
coffin for your Use, two
Pounds. To storing same Six
weaks, ten shillings.
fds
“Jem keeps the coffin as a memorial."
Jem had a sense of humour, so he paid for the
coffin, minus the storage. He keeps it as a
“memorial,” but ever since he settled the account
there has been a coolnesi between him and the
Doctor.

Over a slow-dying lire,
Dreaming old dreams, I am sitting ;
The flames leap up and expire ;
A woman sits opposite knitting.
I’ve taken a Fate to wife ;
She knits, with a half-smile mocking,
Me, and my dreams, and my life,
All into a worsted stocking.

These are true stories about Sir George
Grey : —When he was Governor at the Cape,
Sir George, following up a plan which he
had worked successfully in Maoriland, employed
the natives at road-making and paid them. The
woolly Kaffirs were so delighted with the idea of
making money that they worked, literally like
niggers, but spent their hard-earned coin in orna-
ments (of which the Kaffir ladies got most) such as
armlets, necklets, and other light finery which con-
stitutes the summer costume of the disenfranchised
native female. Now, this extravagance grieved
the heart of Grey and jarred on his
economical instincts ; and so, when he got the
Kaffir bon ton together, he made a long speech
to them, exhausting every phase of the thrifty,
saving and industrious aspects of life, and pic-
turesquely showing up the foolishness of outer
adornment. “I considered when I sat down,”
said Sir George, when he told the story, “that I
had put the case irresistibly. But, after a respectful
pause, an old chief got up and said the Governor
was a wonderful man. Ho had been in many
parts of the world, and knew a great
deal, and was so strong that he actually
got the natives to make roads through their own
land ! But he (the Chief) was a greater man than
Sir George Grey, because he was older and knew
more ; and if Sir George thought he could do any-
thing to prevent women spending their husbands’
money in ornaments and decorations, then he be-
lieved he could do what no man ever had been able
to do ! And to this day Sir George Grey retains a
lively recollection of that as the one occasion on
which he was fairly and permanently put down. In
a more recent encounter with a cultured white Sir
George was seen to better advantage. In Welling-
ton, one day, he met a member of Parliament who
knew the taste of wine when it was blood-red,
and who was sore in his domestic economy.
‘What do you think is the cause of your illness?”
asked Sir George sympathetically. “Well, you
know I’m an old man and I’ve gone through a
great deal,” said his friend. “My dear
said Sir George, with an awful closing of the right
eyelid, “do you think it’s what you’ve gone
through, or what’s g no through you ? ”
My One Admirer.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
1 watched him fading day by day
So peacefully and fair;
I saw his intellect decay—
The bloom of blight was there !
The bloom of blight was there, and I
Some dark day feared to find
Him hold his pipe in mouth awry
Sure sign of loss of mind.
And, though he praised my verse, each word
No more my heart could reach
Because I fancied there I heard
A thickness in his speech !
For I had read, with care and pain,
The Colston ease, which shows
These things mean— something on the brain !
Water, or rum—God knows.
In his Life’s glass I saw the sand
Drop swiftly, with a sigh
He was my one admirer, and
I dreaded he would die.
And if he died—this thought would pass
My lips, in gloom or glee,
Great Heavens what would become —alas !
What would become of me ?
For, when all else were cold and blind
To my poetic art,
I still could count on one warm, kind,
Appreciating heart.
And, when I’d make a joke as drear
As any epitaph,
Gods ! It would split your head to hear
His hoarse, Homeric laugh !
How oft he’s made a pilgrimage
To say —“ You are, bedam,
The greatest poet of the age ! ”
I’d murmur, “ So I am.”
Beneath my spreading mulb’ry tree,
When I’d sit down to think,
He’d lie and gaze in ecstasy—
In ecstasy and drink.
And often, too, it did occur,
When days were calm and fair,
He’d take his little porringer
Of beer, and drink it there.
Yes, he'd drink from that humble cup
Some ten times or eleven,
And, if you held your fingers up,
He’d answer—“ I am seven.
One o’ me’s here upon the ground,
And two are up the tree,
Four in some far-off vat are drowned—
And all are in D.T.”
Ah, famous wits who came by day
And night, indeed, to laugh
At Me and my Admirer, they
Remained to weep—and quaff.
Though some, too, tried, to me unknown,
To lure him past recall—
They read him poems of their own—
He spurned them, one and all !
But, if he had a fault—in fact
He had a fault, I feel ;
’Twas that his admiration smacked,
At times, too much of zeal.
I'm modest as a violet
(As all true genius is),
And shrink from fame; it is my pet
Aversion; ’twas not his.
His fancy, when with whisky fired.
Was, with a whoop, to quick
Make all admire whom he admired,
Or else—to knock them sick.
And so, while 1 concealed my name,
And all proud thoughts dismissed
With pray’r—from bar to bar my fame
He preached, with foot and fist.
And many a morn, policemen brought
Me notes like this : “ Dear Roe
I had an argument—we fought—
Up at the Fox and Crow :
“ A cove there talked, for half the night,
Of Byron, Swinburae, Scott,
I said, with calm, ‘ Creeve Roe can write
Rings round the blessed lot.’
“ He hinted that he hardly saw—
In fact, he had a doubt
I up and broke his blasted jaw—
Please come and bail me out.”
But those brave days are past! Ah, no
Days now have such a vim,
My champion's still alive, but oh,
The difference in him !
He, who could once a cask enfold,
A quart makes overflow ;
He, who could once an epic hold,
Scarce holds a small rondccm.
I tried him but last week with some
Short odes on subjects high,
But, though he was welbprimed with rum,
They knocked him into pi.
And, sometimes when he dodders round,
A wreck of rum and rhyme,
Who can’t stand half-a-pint, or pound,
Of either at a time,
I think of Besant’s Grumbelow :
When he’d the final crunch
Give his wrecks, he’d, to Ball-of-Snow,
Cry “ Bring the Noyeau Punch !”
And so, I fancy, some near day,
I’ll this poor shell explode—
By finishing him off with, say,
A new Australian Ode ;
And on his grave this scroll shall burst
On view of those who pass ;
“ Here lies my One Admirer—First
And Last—Keep off the Grass !”

(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
1 ho western sun, ere ho sought his lair,
Skimm’d the treetops and glancing thence,
Re sted awhile on the curling hair
Of Kitty M'Crae by the bound’ry fe ncc ;
Her eyes looked anxious, her cheeks were pile,
For father was two hours late with the mail.
Never before had he been so late,
And Kitty wondered and wished him back,
Leaning athwart the big swing gate
Leading out on the bridle-track,
A tortuous path that sidled down
From the single street of a mining town.
With her raven curls and her saucy smile,
Brown eyes that glow with a changeful light,
Tenderly trembling all the while
Like a brace of stars on the breast of night,
Where could you find in the light of day
A bonnier lassie than Kitty M‘Crae ?
Born in the saddle, this girl could ride
Like the fearless queen of the silver bow,
And nothing that ever was lapped in hide
Could frighten Kitty M'Crae, I trow.
She would wheel a mob in the hour of need
If the Devil himself were in the lead.
?—■
I I m
But now in the shadows’ deepening,
When the last sun-spark has ceas’d to burn,
Afar she catches the sullen ring
Of horse-hoofs swinging around the turn,
Then painfully down the narrow trail
Comes Alec M‘Crae with the Greytown mail.
“ The fever-and-ague, my girl,” he said,
“ ’Twas all I got on that northern trip,
When it left me then I was well-nigh dead,
Has got me fast in its iron grip;
And I’d rather rot in the nearest gaol
Than ride to-night with the Greytown mail.
“ At Golden Gully they heard to-day—
’Twas a common topic about the town—
That the Mulligan Gang were around this way,
So they wouldn’t dispatch the gold-dust
down,
And Brown, the manager, said he thought
It wise to wait for a strong escort.
“ I rode the leaders, the other nags
I left with the coach at the ‘ Travellers’
Rest. ’
Kitty, my lass, you must take the bags—
Postboy, I reckon’s about the best;
Tis dark, I know, but he’ll never fail
To take you down with the Greytown mail.”
It needed no further voice to urge
This dutiful daughter to eager haste ;
She donned tire habit, of rough blue serge,
That hung in folds from her slender waist,
Postb °y stood by the stockyard rail,
While she mounted behind the Greytown mail.
Dark points, the rest of him iron-grey,
Boasting no strain of expensive blood,
Down the steepest hill he could pick his way,
And never was baulked by a winter flood—
Strong as a lion, hard as a nail,
Was the horse that carried the Grey town mail ;
C?
A nag that really seemed to be
Fit for a hundred miles at a push,
With the old Manaro pedigree,
By “ Furious Riding,” out of “ The Bush,”
Run in when a colt from a mountain mob
By Brian O’Flynn and Dusty Bob.
Old Postboy’s bosom was filled with pride
As he felt the form of his mistress sway,
In its easy grace, to his swinging stride,
As he dashed along down the narrow way.
No prettier Mercury, I’ll go bail,
Than Kitty ere carried a Guv’ment mail.
Leaving the slope of O’Connor’s Hill,
They merrily scattered the drops of dew
In the spanning of many a tiny rill,
Whose babbling waters were hid from view :
In quick-step time, to the curlew’s wail
Rode Kitty M'Crae, with the Greytown mail.
Sidling the Range, by a narrow path,
Where the tow’ring mountain ash-trees grow,
And a slip meant more than an icy bath
In the tumbling waters that foamed below ;
Through the white fog, filling each silent vale,
Rode Kitty M'Crae with the Greytown mail.
The forest shadows became less dense,
They fairly flew down the river fall,
As out from the shade of an old brush-fence
Stepped three armed men with a sudden call,
Sharp and stern came the well-known hail :
“ Stand ! for we want the Greytown mail ! ”
Postboy swerved with a mighty bound,
As an outlaw clung to his bridle rein,
A hoof-stroke flatten’d him on the ground
With a curse that was half a cry of pain,
While Kitty, trembling and rather pale,
Struck out for life and the Greytown mail.
To save the bags were her only thought
As she bent ’fore the whistle of angry lead
That follow’d the flash and the sharp report;
But “Oh, you cowards ! ” was all she said
Flying as fast as the leaden hail—
Kitty M‘Crae with the Greytown mail.
Safe ? ah, no, for a tiny stream
On Postboy’s coat left its crimson mark.
She still rode on, but ’twas in a dream,
Through lands where shadows fell drear and
dark ;
Like a wounded sea-bird before the gale
Fled Kitty M‘Crae with the Greytown mail.
And ever the erimson life-stream drips,
For every hoof-stroke a drop of blood,
From feeble fingers the bridle slips
As down the Warrigal Flat they scud,
And just where the Redbank workings lie,
She reels and falls with feeble cry.
The old horse slacken’d his racing pace
When he found the saddle his only load,
And nervously sniffed at the still, pure face
That lay upturned in the dusty road ;
Like a gathered rose in the heat of day,
She droop’d and faded, Kitty M'Crae.
Did Postboy stay by the dead girl’s side ?
Not he. Relieved of her featherweight,
He woke the echoes with measured stride,
Galloping up to the postal gate—
Blood, dust, and sweat from head to tail,
A riderless horse with the Greytown mail.
And now a river-oak, drooping, weeps
In ceaseless sorrow above the grave
On the lush-green flat where Kitty sleeps,
Hush’d by the river’s lapping wave
That ever tells to the trees the tale
Of how she rode with the Greytown mail.
"SURCINGLE."
Crow—With an “E.”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Timothy Crow was a pleasant, decent old
fellow who pottered about at odd times in his
dilapidated tinsmith’s shop—a shop filled with a
litter of pots and pans and rubbish generally.
He had laid by a little money, made principally in
the early days, and on this he managed to subsist,
so what work he performed professionally was
done mainly from a love of handling the tools and
whiling away the hours. His wife was dead, and
he lived in the back room alone. Sometimes the
old woman who came to clean up things about the
place stayed awhile to talk with him, but he was
not over partial to Mrs. Button.
One day Timothy put down his tools, lifted
off the nail the green-brown coat that hung
there, and made his way down the street till
he came to the local bank. The clerk at the
counter knew him, and nodded kindly as the old
man said, bending across the counter, and speak,
ing in a low voice : “I want to send some money
to my son up in the Northern Territory.”
“I did not know that you had a son, Mr.
Crow,” the clerk observed, preparing to fill up a
form.
“It’s nigh ten years since he was down,”
Timothy answered. “He is a bit above the shop,”
he added, smiling faintly.
The clerk smiled too—to himself —and said :“ I
want your son’s name, Mr. Crow.”
“Arthur Crow,” the old man replied, and,
speaking with some little hesitation, continued •
“ put an ‘ e ’ on the end of it.”
The clerk looked up. Timothy understood, and
explained, in a genial, humble fashion : “My son
has risen a bit in the world. He is a commission-
agent up there. I haven’t seen him myself, but
some chaps that came down say that he’s a big
swell—and wears a ‘ belltopper.’ He told me him-
self in a letter not to forget the * e.’ ”
The clerk handed over the draft, and the old
man returned to the shop, took off the green-
brown coat, and went to work again on a leaky
tea-pot.
In the evening, after the departure of Mrs,
Button, who always made him uncomfortable by
her positive manner, he put the pen and ink on
the table and got out some paper and envelopes ;
arranging these before him, he unfolded the draft
and carefully read out the words “On demand
pay to the order of me, Arthur Crowe, the sum of
twenty-five pounds.” “He will be pleased to get
that, he thought, even supposing he is a bit
ashamed of his old father, and the shop—and the
Spelling of the name. I suppose it does look
better with an ‘e.’”
Thus thinking, old Timothy gradually dozed
off. Soon he awakened, and remembering
what he had to do, reached over for an envelope
and slowly and painfully scratched on it “ Mr. A.
Crow.” Then the picture of his magnificent son
came into his mind, and in the goodness of his
honest old parental heart he added “Esquir.”
The rest of the address was concluded after much
painful labour, the draft re-folded, placed in the
envelope, and sealed up. He then looked at the
letter contemplatively as it lay on the table before
him. Timothy had not intended to send any
accompanying letter of explanation with the
enclosure. It was to be a surprise as well as a
Christmas-box, and might be useful to his son in
that Territory where everything was so dear. But
later on the old man found his heart yearn after
the smart, “ gentlemanly ” young man who wore
the belltopper, so in the corner of the envelope
laboriously wrote “From his Ever Loving father,
Timothy Crow.”
A fortnight later there might have been seen
stuck in the corner of a large pier-glass over the
mantelpiece in the public room of the Territory
Hotel a letter addressed to “ Mr. A. Crow,
Esquir, commission Agent. Jumbahtown,” and in
the corner the words “FromhisEver Loving father
Timothy Crow.” It was the latter phrase’
together with the general character of the ad.
dress, that excited the grins of every visitor to the
room. Bank-manager, clerk, solicitor, auctioneer,
broker’s clerk, each one as he walked in
caught sight of the object in the corner of the
glass, went straight to it, read it attentively,
then smiled and joked about it—or said nothing
at all. There had been no malicious intent in
placing the letter where it invited so much atten.
tion, for the pier-glass was a favourite letter-rack
and saved much trouble in the delivery of corres-
pondence.
Later in the evening a well-dressed young man
with black hair, good-looking from a girl’s point
of view, and of confident style, walked into the bar.
“ Have you been in the coffee-room, Mr. Crow ?*
the barmaid enquired of him when he entered.
‘‘There’s a letter for you.”
The young man sauntered into the public room.
Several people were there, all of whom he knew. So,
nodding around to the company, he walked to the
glass, took the envelope and read the address and
message scribbled in the corner, noting especially
the illiterate character of the production. Simul-
taneously there flashed across his mind a mental
procession of curious visitors to the room, who had
examined the letter and commented on it de-
risively. Thus thinking, he felt thoroughly sick
and disgusted and put the letter back in its place
unopened.
“That’s for you, Crow, isn’t it?” the bank-
manager inquired blandly from the table.
“ That thing !” and the young man inclined his
head contemptuously towards the pier-glass.
“No, thank you, dear boy, my name is spelt with
an ‘e.’ I don’t know who on »arth Timothy
Crow is. He is certainly not my father ! ’
As he finished speaking the proprietor of the
“Territory” entered the room. “Oh, you got
your letter, then, Mr. Crow,” he remarked cheer-
fully, observing the young man in front of the
?iass.
“That’s not for me, damn you!” the young
man replied, out of temper; but the proprietor
took no notice of the speech or of its tone. It was a
free country, and his guests could curse and swear
at him just as they pleased so long as they ordered
drinks and paid for them.
The obnoxious envelope remained for a few days
in the corner of the pier-glass, and then was seen
no more. It had probably fallen on to the mantel-
piece, then into the fireplace, and finally been
conveyed to the rubbish-heap. Certain it is that
the young man who spelt his name with an “ e ”
did not take possession of it, and his peace of
mind became rapidly restored concurrently with
its disappearance.
The “From his father, Timothy Crow ” incident
had put a temporary check upon the smart young
man’s manner of swelling it around among “ The
Territory’s ” habitues, yet the disclaiming of his
old father’s missive caused him but little pricking
of conscience. He knew what the old man would
have to say—“l hope things are prospering with
you, my son, trade is very dull down here, things
are going from worse to bad, and Missis Button
hopes you are getting on well.” And so on. He
had received such letters before. j
Several months passed and Crow, the commis-
sion-agent with an “e” to his name was still
the most gorgeous potentate in the township
of Jumbahtown. Nobody could possibly sus-
pect the father of so distinguished-looking a
personage to be an illiterate'old tinker somewhere
down South, and even the son had almost for-
gotten it, but the grey-headed father thought
always of his son as he rummaged among the pots
and tins, and daily expected a letter from the
Northern Territory. Yet, when he found that it
came not, he did not mind ; “ so long as Arthur’s
got the draft, that’s all I care about.” It was
thus the o;d man tried to console himself.
But one evening the old fellow got out his pens
and paper, and, labouring with much zeal and
patience, at last produced the following letter
“Mi Deer Son, — I expect you got mi letter with the
draft from the bank for £25 in it, perhaps you was too'
busy to rite and say you had got it, I am going to marry
Missis Button, but if you think I ought not to marry just
rite and tell me, and I will tell her I am too old, and you
won’t have it. lam going to make my will, I will wate
till you rite first, I feel I ought to konsult you first about
the above steps, you will rite I no mi son this time.”
Again the decent old tinsmith scrawled an
address to his son up in the Territory. It was
difficult to break an ignorant scratchy pen of a
life-long habit, so the “ E ’’-less Crowe again went
on its mission.
Tiie landlord of the Territory, a week later,
observed casually to Mr. Crowe, the commission-
agent, as he entered the bar: “Another of those
letters for you, Crowe, addressed like the other,
you remember, from Timothy Crow —came to-day.
I said it was of no use to leave it, and sent it back.
I suppose that it is all right ?”
The bank-manager and solicitor, and one or two
more of the commission-agent’s friends were
standing by as the landlord spoke.
“Of course it was. It was not for me, Hurley,
old man, you knew that—come on boys, name youi
liquors,” said the commission-agent, putting
down half-a-sovereign.
No more letters arrived at the Territory Hotel
to be rejected by the thoughtful Hurley, or any-
one else, for lack of the second vowel; and the
young man whose name was Crow, “spelt with
an ‘e,’” was not again called upon to use bad
language on that account.
The months passed by, and one afternoon the
coach brought among its passengers to Jumbah-
town an elderly man who had travelled from far
down South. He had made friends with the
driver, who had taken a fancy to the honest-
spoken old fellow. The old man was going up to
see his son, “ whom he had not seen for nigh
upon ten year,” but he was a fine young man for
all that, he had heard. It gladdened him im-
mensely when the driver said “ he knew his son, if
his name was Crow.” And then the old man
became communicative and told of a Christmas-
box which he had sent his son a good while ago.
“ I did think somehow he would -"'rite and tell
me he had got it.”
The driver thought so too.
“ But I didn’t mind that till I wrote again, and
then I felt it a bit when I still got no answer.”
Tor no suspicion of postal miscarriage or any
possible cause of non-receipt by the owner had
ever entered the simple parental old head.
Now, the driver of Jumbahtown coach had
heard all about the rejected letters from Hurley
in the coach yard, on each occasion. “He is a
mean pup and liar,” Hurley had said with
righteous indignation. “ I opened the last letter
and it was from his poor old man. He is a mean
cur ! ”
Much interest was exercised at the long table of
“ The Territory ” that night by the presence of
“Crowe’s old man.” Some said that the son
would have repudiated the father as he had done
his letter save for Nature’s unmistakable evidence,
but his behaviour at table provoked no comment.
“ You are an old fool, that’s all I’ve got to say,
though you are my father.” They were sitting
in the office of Arthur Crowe, commission-agent,
an hour after dinner.
“Don’t be hard on me, Artz,” was the reply in
a penitent, humble voice. “If you had only
opened my letter ’twould have been all right.
For I would have done what you told me.”
“Damnation! couldn’t you think and act for
yourself? you’re old enough ! ” was the son’s cruel
response.
“Don’t say that, Artz, You don’t know what
she was. When she had you by yourself. . . .
It was done before I knew it and . If you had
only written, Artz, and said you objected, that
was what I wanted—l didn’t want to marry her.”
“ You did marry her, there can be no two ways
about it. And to make over your property to her !
Great God ! ”
“ She told me to go to you, Artz —said you’d be
glad to give me a home, but I’ll go back if you
like,” said the old man, sadly and meekly.
And go he did. Jumbahtown talked about it
for a day or two after, whenever it got together
in knots and conversation fell slack: but no
retributive act to fall upon the head of the com-
mission-agent was agreed upon, and Crowe was
just as much one of the boys as ever. His half-
sovereign, put down upon the counter to pay for
drinks, is still as acceptable as any other, "Not
that the moral sense in Jumbahtown is below the
average. It is because it is of the average that
Arthur Crowe does not writhe beneath the local
scorn.
This much must be said, however. Instead of
bank-drafts arriving in Jumbahtown for Crowe,
spelt with an “e,” regularremittances proceed from
Jumbahtown, destined for an old man down
South whose name also is Crow, but without an “e.”
He receives these remittances with thankfulness
and gratitude; and a hope and trust that ere
he dies he may be permitted to clasp a loving son
to his honest, simple, old heart
PELICAN.

Li Chew’s Revenge.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Bandicoot Inn certainly did a good
oeer-trade —a trade out of all proportion to the
size of the township, which -consisted of about a
dozen buildings. But then the Bandicoot was the
only pub. for miles round, and although the
population of the district was sparse, it included
a few regular “ soakers,” whose expenditure was
simply tremendous.
Baxter, the landlord, was a little sharp man,
with a thirst that vegetables could be cooked
upon. He paid a big rent for the place, but that
didn’t matter much, because-Lushton, his land-
lord, spent the rent and more at the hotel. And
amongst other good customers were Craddick,
who received regular monthly remittances from
England, and drank
them as regularly ; and
Dableigh, a small squat-
ter, who drank out his
flocks and herds at Bax-
ter’s. Then there were
Johnson and Wrigley,
the two local store-
keepers, who conspired
to keep up high prices
during the day, and to
keep up high jinks at the
Bandicoot at night. So
if Baxter’s customers
were not very numerous
they were arid and par-
ticularly select.
Baxter was a bachelor,
and his establishment
comprised Li Chew (a
Chinese cook), and a
rouseabout who answered
to the name of Moss,
probably owing to the
resemblance of his hair
and beard to that un-
cared-for product of
Nature. On the whole
these two had not a
very happy time of it,
for Baxter, though very
obsequious to his cus-
tomers, was at times
shockingly abusive to his
underlings. Moss’s feel-
ings did not suffer much,
perhaps, for he was
always drunk, or nearly
always so, and walked
about in a partially un-
conscious state What
Li Chew felt on such
occasions could not be
gathered from his coun-
tenance —he only smiled.
One morning the
weather was wet, a,nd
business dull —a reaction
from the previous night.
Baxter felt dull, too, and
in a very bad humour.
Passing the kitchen,
therefore, he stopped and
blasphemed at the cook
on general principles,
and, as usual, Li Chew
smiled his own apologetic
smile —the same old pre-
historic smile which the
original Chinaman used
when he woke in a new
world, and said that
things were “Allee li.”
Perhaps it was the smile
that aggravated Baxter
—it is difficult to say.
Anyhow, he suddenly
clutched his Asiatic fol-
lower and rushed him
furiously up and down
the passage by the pig-
tail. When he was tired
of this exhilarating
exercise he kicked the
terrified Celestial back
into his kitchen. Then
the heathen rubbed the
afflicted parts and smiled,
but the smile was pecu-
liar. Could anyone have
interpreted it he would
have known that Li
Chew meditated an
awful vengeance.
The Mongol pottered
about the kitchen that
day just as usual, but in
the silence of the night
he sat down and com-
posed a strange-looking
epistle to a Melbourne
cousin, asking him to
obtain and send up to
him a specified quantity
of a certain drug.
A few days afterwards
there was an unusually
large number to dinner,
and before serving it Li
Chew locked his kitchen-
door and steadily mixed
a mysterious-lookinggrey
powder with the soup
and other enticing con-
coctions And his smile
as he did so was the
smile of a fiend boiling
a martyr in a cauldron.
# # #
Li Chew continued
to perform the mys-
terious rite witli the grey powder for some time,
and soon there was an unaccountable falling-off in
trade at the Bandicoot. One forenoon Baxter sat
on his verandah smoking, and wondering what
had become of the local thirst. Most of his
regular customers had not come near him for
days. He sat and looked very dismal and swore
huskily, but his face brightened when he saw
Craddick and Dableigh, two of his surest sources
of income,riding into the township, and he strolled
into the bar to be ready to serve thein. But,
contrary to all precedent, they did not turn into
the bar —they made their way straight to the
billiard-room, whither Baxter followed, with a
gloomy foreboding that they had sworn off, and
intended to drink no more. But his fears were
soon allayed, for the squatter said —“I’ll give you
ten out of fifty, Craddiok, for drinks.”
Craddick accepted the challenge, and the game
terminated in Dableigh’s favour. Then the drinks
were brought m—whisky for both. But instead
of drinking they sat on the table and talked. At
last Dableigh said :
“ You can take mine back again, Baxter. I
ink I’ll have an English ale instead.”
u Ditto here,” said Craddick.
So a'bottle'of ale was produced, but to the
publican’s consternation, his two best customers
raised the potions to their lips, only to set them
down again untasted.
“ I’m hanged if I care to drink at all to-day,”
observed Craddick. , .
Th at s curious. I was just about to say the
same thing,’ laughed the squatter; where s
Moss-it 11 be fun to see him put away the lot.
_ So Moss came in with his hair and beard stand-
ing up in their usual state of consternation, and
cheerfully undertook to drink up everything. He
hadn’t seen a liquor, he remarked sadly, for two
days. He got no wages from Baxter; lie worked
for his tucker and straggling nips, and these had
been very scarce lately. He came in briskly, full
of anticipation. He tackled the whisky first, but
put it down without sampling it; then he tried
the ale with the same result. The look of per-
fsd
AN OLD STORY RE-TOLD.
1. “Yes, your brains are softening, but we’ll soon put that right. Leave them with me for a few days.”-2. “Excuse me a second
while I put them in alcohol. I’ll stitch your occiput together again presently.”-3. “So! Now, if you’ll just keep your hat on,
nobody will be any the wiser.”-4. “Good afternoon! Just look in on Wednesday, and you shall have your brains back as good
as new.”-5. (Days, weeks, months having e'apsed): “I wonder why the deuce that young man never called for his brains? Doubt-
less inflammation or erysipelas set in.”-6. “Oh, how do you do? Why have you never called for your brains? I made a splendid
job of it?” “Oh—ah—er—a—thanks, Doctor. The fact is I don’t want brains any more. I’ve got a billet in the Civil Service.”
plexity on Moss's uillovely phiz, was a sight to
wonder at, and the three others sat and wondered
at it accordingly. There was a long silence—
everybody seemed staggered.
At length Moss said hesitatingly : “ I’d rather
have them drinks later on, if it’s all the same to
you, gents ; ” and as it was all the same to them,
Craddiok paid for the untasted liquor, and they
rode away too full for speech. They had often
before ridden away from the Bandicoot “ too full
for speech,” but this time they had witnessed a
miracle. Moss had refused a drink !
Unfortunately for Baxter, all his customers
behaved in the same unaccountable way. John-
son and Wrigley, although they turned up to play
cards cr billiards, and to dinner, in the old style,
never spent anything on liquor, and it was the
same with all the others. As it wasn’t “public”
policy to keep an odd man who was too odd to
drink, the landlord sacked Moss and procured
another old soaker, who could and would drink,
but he left in a day or two because the “ bloomin’
billet wasn't worth a booze a week.” Then the
unhappy publican tried to get Lushton to reduce
the rent on the plea that trade was bad, but that
worthy couldn’t see it. He was now a teetotaller,
and, so far from reducing the rent, he would have
liked to raise it so as to get back some of his much-
regretted coin from the publican.
# # #
Li Chew still remained faithful to the
fallen Bandicoot, and made daily incantations
with the mysterious grey powder, and the label on
the outside of the package read —“The Golden
Specific—a sure cure for drunkenness.” But
Baxter’s appetite for strong drink had not de-
parted like the others. Li Chew took care of
that. The publican, like many of his occupation,
was a poor eater, and cared only for one or two of
the heathen’s most tempting dishes. These Li
Chew never interfered with, and day after day the
Chinaman’s shattered enemy sat in solemn soli-
tude, and gloomily drank up his own stock, and
grew red-nosed and despondent. But Baxter still
stuck to the Bandicoot Inn, and Li Chew stuck to
Baxter, though the payment of his wages had now
become a matter of doubt. He was waiting with
the patience of his race for his revenge, which he
enjoyed to the full when the following advertise-
ment appeared in the papers :
Samuel Baxter, of Barktown, licensed victualler. Cause
of insolvency—falling off in business, high rent and
pressure of creditors. Liabilities, &c., &c.
» * •
The sign of the -Bandicoot Inn has been
altered (o “Barktown Coffee Palace, Li Chew,
proprietor.” Li Chew has also some reputation as
a Chinese doctor, and is making money. Baxter
is a rouseabout on Dableigh’s station now, and
whenever he meets his former cook he affects not
to see him. But Li Chew doesn’t mind that. He
only smiles. He has smiled off and on ever since
that day when Baxter dragged him about in the
passage, but connoisseurs assert that the time
when his grin was most affable was that on which
his old employer went in a bloated and dejected
state down the front steps never to come back. On
that occasion he spread both his hands out and
exclaimed, in a loud voice, “ Hi-yek !” Probably
it was a Chinese blessing.
J. A. MUIRHEAD.
Large, outstanding ears have long been
regarded as emblems of honesty, ingenuousness,
and generosity in young people. Boys mostly
have these symptoms well developed, little girls—
well, not much. The sex is born artful and care-
ful, not to say stingy, as a rule. Big-eared boys,
too, are found to get rid of their honorable dis-
tinction as time goes on. With the loss of in-
genuousness the outgrowth of ear ceases, and the
sound catcher commences to curl up a trifle as th e
young man acquires a taste for money, or a strong
desire to “get on” in a world where generosity
stands in the way of a “successful career.” And
when the middle - aged
sinner forgets to be honest
his ears begin to fall back
upon his skull. Then
his parents—if they are
alive, and study physical
evidences—look at their
boy of forty-five years
standing and sigh for
the ears that are gone.
Always raise your hat to
the lad who has plates
of gristle projecting
violently from either side
of his innocent young
head. Nature, we fancy,
intended them for sugges-
tions of angels’ wings.
TOMMY'S EARS.
We used to. look at
Tommy’s ears,
My Mary Jane and I,
Our sorrow didn’t run to
tears
But often we would
sigh
To see them sticking out
so far,
Instead of keeping
coy—
You know how faddy
parents are
About an only boy.
In linen they were neatly
bound
When Tommy went to
bed—
His mother put a bandage
round
The urchin’s curly
head ;
But O! those ears ap-
peared to scorn
The pressure so ap-
plied
And stuck out worse
when, in the morn.
That bandage was
untied.
Our ears were neat
enough,indeed,
And not obtrusive
thus—
He didn’t take (we both
agreed)
Such ugly things from
us.
Young Tommy went his
joyous way,
And never seemed to
care
How far across the land-
scape they
Were stretching
through his hair.
The light of truth was
on his face,
Big merry eyes he
had,
No stain of action mean
or base
Had come upon the
lad.
He’d laugh andsing with-
out a pause,
Except it was to shout —
And yet we felt aggrieved
because
His ears were sticking
out.
Ileigho ! for those good
olden days;
There’s simple truth,
we find,
In what some cynic
student says
Concerning human-
kind.
His maxim may provoke
a sneer,
Perchance a guilty
start,}
But, ah ! “the flat, out-
standing ear
Denotes the honest
heart.”
We often look at Thomas
now,
And sadly think of
then;
And though, of course,
we won’t allow
He’s like most other
men,
Maybe we wish the cute
and quick
Had gone to join the
dead
Before his ears began to stick
So closely to his head.
Time bent them back by slow degrees
Without a linen band,
He had to make his bread and cheese,
And—well, you understand.
Did’st ever see a cunning horse —
The sort a backer fears—
A-sidling down a racing course,
And laying back his ears ?
But to our castle home in Spain
We sometimes fly in grief,
And Tom is there a boy again
With ears in bold relief ;
His mother doesn’t want them tied,
Nor calls them ugly things
They seem as emblems sanctified
Of little angels’ wings.

A COW STORY.


The Ghost’s Victory.
AN ORTHODOX CHRISTMAS STORY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
’ This is a tough contract,” murmured the ghost
as it gazed out of the window of the haunted
chamber and looked up and down the almost
deserted street. Needless to say it was Christmas
Eve, and the clocks had just struck twelve.
It was not at all an awe-inspiring ghost. If one
had not known for certain that it was a spectre it
might have been taken for a shabby old debt-
collector or a haggard bailiff; but it was a genuine
goblin, and anybody infringing the trade-mark
will be prosecuted.
The house it haunted was an old stone affair,
situated on a good-sized allotment in one of the
principal streets of Sydney. Most people have
passed the place and wondered why it was so dull
and murky and desolate, and why a tattered bill
always announced that the upper part was “to
let.” It was owned by an absentee landlord, and
there was a law-suit on it, and three mortgages*
Around it was a solemn, melancholy waste*
tenanted by old jam - tins and goats. Th e
ground-floor was supposed to be occupied a s
offices, whilst the upper portion was left to solitude
—and the ghost.
I his was the spectre’s grievance. Thirty years
before it had cut its throat there, and since enter'
ing into the land of spirits it had not had a single
opportunity of frightening anybody and achieving
a reputation. It had madejust one publicappear-
ance, and then it fell flat. It was an orthodox
apparition, and as such was strictly obliged to
appear only between midnight and cockcrow,
but nobody lived in the house, nobody knew it
was haunted, nobody cared whether it was
haunted or not. So there it had remained, a
poor, forlorn, neglected ghost living alone in the
dark and damp, all forgotten.
“Christmas again,” it muttered in spectral
grammar, “and still lam unknown. O! if I
were only one of these modern young ghosts who
go round visiting friends and relations and scaring
the wits out of them j but, no ! X am old-fashioned
and must abide by the rules of the game. Why, I
might have heaps of hidden money here to show
people for aught the public know.” Then it fell
to musing over the one chance that had fallen in
its way.
It had been gazing sadly out of the window as
usual at about one o’clock in the morning when
there came the sound of unsteady steps down the
street. Presently a stout old gentleman in even-
ing dress, with his hat on one side and an overcoat
on his arm, stopped suddenly in front of the gate
and gazed curiously at the building. Would he
come in? The ghost’s heart beat fast with
anxiety.
“ Astonishing !” said the old gentleman. “ How
on earth did I get home so quick? Don’t re-
member the tram—don t remember the train. My
house, though, right enough.” He opened the
crazy gate and lurched in.
“At last, at last!” cried the apparition, re-
straining itself by a mighty effort from appearing
on the verandah and prematurely flushing its
game.
The old gentleman tried to put a latch-key in
the door, but as there was no keyhole he failed.
Then he kicked and knocked and swore. Finally
lie coiled himself up on the verandah, and after a
grunt or two went fast asleep.
Then the exultant spectre passed through the
crack underneath the door, and stood contem-
plating its unconscious victim. But all the old
gentleman did was to turn over and say, pettishly,
as he dragged his coat over his shoulders, “Don’t,
Maria!”
This put the ghost on its mettle. It laid an ice-
cold hand on the sleeper and, in a thrilling
whisper, said, “Awake!”
The old gentleman sat up and blinked at the
vision of the dead, and the vision regarded the old
gentleman.
“Eight, old boy !’’ said the latter. “I’ll wake
up in time, never fear. Bring me a stiff brandy-
and-soda at 8. Good night. Gobless you !” and
he lay down again and snored.
This was maddening. A ghost to be mistaken
for a waiter and told to bring a brandy-and-soda
in the morning ! It fled through the top window
to the haunted chamber and sat down on the
bloodstain and cried.
Time passed, but no other mortal visited the
haunted house between midnight and daylight.
Other ghosts came. Ghosts who were allowed out at
nights; and they used to tel! the old deceased in-
habitant what joyous times they had ; but that
only made things worse. Sometimes it thought
that a burglar might break in during the small
hours and give it a chance ; but, then, the occu-
pants of the two alleged offices hadn’t enough
between them to allure any respectable burglar;
and the burglars knew it.
Sorrowfully the poor old apparition mused, and
if it could only have repeated the operation of
cutting its throat it would have done so out of
sheer desperation and ennui.
At that moment the sound of approaching foot'
steps broke the stillness.
Two men, in earnest conversation, halted oppo-
site the gate, and, by the light of the street lamp,
the ghost saw that one of them was the occupant
of one of the offices. He was some sort of an
agent—general commission- and, as the ghost
know, his principal occupation was hiding behind
some old tanks in the back-yard when his creditors
called, which they did constantly. The old ghost,
in its invisible state, used to do a good deal of
wandering about in the day-time.
After a few minutes’ more talk the two men
came in, and the agent proceeded to unlock the
door.
The ghost nearly shrieked with joy. How
should it make the most startling appearance? It
decided to await them in the passage and shake
its gaunt arms in the shadows.
.The agent struck a match, opened the door of
his office, and was about entering, followed by his
companion, when, by the expiring light of the
match, the latter caught a glimpse of the appari-
tion standing at the end of the passage,
“ Hallo! somebody living here?” he said.
“No,” said the agent, who had lit another
match and was searching for a candle.
“Thought I saw sometliing at the end of the
passage.”
“Pooh! Oats, I suppose. This is a regular
meeting-place of theirs ;” and the agent picked up
an empty stone ink-bottle and, going to the door,
hurled it down the passage, crying “Shoo! get
out!” Then he shut the office-door.
The ink-bottle went clean through the ghost,
but the insult hurt it worse. First, to be taken
for a waiter, then to be “ shoo’ed ” at for a cat.
It approached the office vowing vengeance, and
tramping frantically with the spectres of its old
shadow feet on the floor. It was about to pass
through the door, and with a blood-curdling shriek
appear before them, with its gashed and bleeding
throat, but a few words it heard arrested it. The
ghost stopped and listened.
“Come, Tom, hurry up and get me those papers
I left with you ; I must go on board, we start at
five sharp,” said the younger man to the agent.
Tom sat on the edge of the ricketty deal table,
swinging one leg moodily to and fro, but made no

attempt to move.
“ You know how frightfully hard-up we’ve
been ?” he said at last.
“ Of course I do; has not my sister told me all
about it to-day, and, as you know, I gave her all
the money I could to keep you going for a bit.
I can do no more. Give me the papers.”
“ Well, then,” said the agent, getting up,
desperately and defiantly, “ I haven’t got them.”
“Not got them!” repeated the other. “God
Almighty, man ! what do you mean?”
“ Mean what I say.”
“What have you done with them?”cried the
younger, fiercely.
“ The bank has them, as security.”
The agent’s brother-in-law gazed at him in
silence. “Do you know,” he said at last, quite
quietly, “ that you have ruined me ?”
“ I can redeem them, and send them to you
overland,” muttered the other, with white lips.
“ Bah ! you redeem them; how?”and he glanced
round the poverty-stricken room. “Even if you
had the money, or could get it, how could you
redeem them before Monday? This is Friday,
and before you could forward them we should
have left Brisbane. You’ve ruined yourself, and
now, ruined me.”
The agent said nothing, and his companion
walked impatiently up and down the room.
“ How much did you get advanced on them ’’’
“ Five hundred pounds.”
“ And what became of it?”
“ Speculated with it. That was the temptation.
I knew of such a safe thing.”
“ Such a safe thing !”said the other, mockingly.
There was silence for a time. The younger man
continued his wild-beast walk, and the agent
leant against the table with folded arms and eyes
cast down.
Half-an-hour passed, but the ghost was not
impatient; after thirty years of loneliness, this
little tragedy was interesting. Besides, it had
cut its throat for doing almost the same thing
the agent had done. Would the agent cut his
throat ? In that case he would also become a
ghost.
“ I dare not go back with ut those deeds,” said
the young man, at last. “How do you propose
to get them back ?”
“ I think I can borrow the money.”
“ If that is all I have to rely on, why, they are
gone. Well, if it comes to the worst, I must go
to the bank and demand their restitution as stolen
property. I don’t know how the law stands, but
I believe they will give them up and ”
“ Prosecute me,” said the agon* - .
“ I suppose so. I will do my duty even though
it puts you in gaol.”
“You will put me in gaol, will you ?” snarled
the agent, walking up to his companion with an
ugly look on his face.
The ghost executed a double shuffle in his joy,
and pranced about in the passage. There was
going to be a murder, and he would have another
ghost to bear him company.
The young man confronted his brother-in-law,
and said, quietly, “If every other means fails, I
must inform the bank ; and after that I cannot
interfere. ”
Tom fell back, and said, after a pause, “You
had better leave me. I must try and think of
some way out of this.”
The other seemed in no hurry to stay, and
walked to the door, merely remarking, “I will see
you this afternoon.” Then the front-door
slammed behind him, and the house was left to the
agent and the ghost.
Was the agent going to cut his throat? The
ghost looked anxiously in; such an opportunity
was worth waiting thirty years for.
Was he going to cut his throat? Nothing of
the sort. The agent looked quite relieved, as
though an unpleasant task had at last been got
over. He lit another candle and turned towards
the old-fashioned fireplace on one side of the
room. The ghost watched him curiously. It was
a hearth for burning wood ; and the agent prized
up one of the side stones, and from a hole under-
neath took out a large cash-box, put it on the table,
and opened it. The spirit rushed through the
wall unseen, and looked over his shoulder. The
box was full of sovereigns. The agent counted
them over with a sigh of relief, replaced the
box in its hiding place, and made ready to go.
The apparition had passed through the wall
again into the dark passage. It would never do to
scare the agent now ; he was coming back for that
box, and then—the ghost hugged itself in antici-
pation. The agent closed and locked his door;
slammed the front-door after him and departed.
The ghost stopped behind and chuckled. It was
all as plain as the proverbial pikestaff, and to be
summed up in one word, “bolt.” The five
hundred pounds had not gone in speculation ; they
were in the cash-box, besides other little pickings.
The spectre reckoned it all up on its shadowy
fingers; holiday time, crowds travelling about,
best chance in the world to get away ; he’s off,
with whatever he can lay his hands on, leaves his
wife and children to do the best they can, robs his
brother-in-law, and ruins the people who own
those deeds ; now, how can I circumvent him ?
The ghost fell into a brown study. “If I could
only materialise myself like some of these new
fungled spirits say they can I might collar that
money and tell the young fellow all about it, but
I can t. If I appear before him I shall scare him,
and then he might not come back here. I’ll best
that fellow though if I ” —die for it, the ghost was
about to say, but as he had done that already ho
changed the expression. Just then the daylight
lightened the eastern sky, and it vanished, but its
face wore a look of satisfaction that was not on it
before ; evidently the apparition had an idea. t
Christmas day passed in the usual manner, so
far as the ghost was concerned ; that is to say,
nobody came near the place, and it either sat on
the blood-spot or looked cut of the window. Mid-
night struck, and the ghost was happy. It had
six hours of visibility before it, and in a shadowy
sort of way it cleared the deck for action.
At half-past twelve the agent made his appear-
ance carrying a small portmanteau.
He struck a match before closing the front door,
and dropped it immediately with a yell. Some-
body was leaning against the door of his room, a
strange, mouldy-looking little man who smelt
exactly like a damp umbrella. Resisting the im-
pulse to turn and fly, he waited and listened,
ihere was no sound but the violent thumping of
his own heart. He looked round into the street
behind him to reassure himself, mustered up his
nerve, and struck another match. This time the
passage was empty. He wiped the beads of per-
spiration from his forehead and laughed with
considerable difficulty. Then he unlocked his own
door, but he left the front
door open. Nobody in his
room so far as he could see
with a mat’ll, so he lit the
candle and —it was no fancy.
An old man with a ghastly
white face and a horrible
blood - stain on his white
beard and shirt front was
sitting 100.-e in the air about
three feet above the floor.
He might have stood Ids
ground even then, but the
thing started to walkthrough
the air towards him, and,
smitten with unreasoning
panic, he turned and ran
through the open door, and
the triumphant ghost
heard his flying footsteps
die away in the distance.
“ Now for the other man,”
muttered the ghost.
One o’clock struck, and
in a few minutes the ghost
heard someone entering the
house. Both doors were still
open and the candle still
burning, so the new-comer
walked straight in He
stopped short inside the
room. Seated at the table
where he expected to find
his relative was a seedy old
gentleman who, in spite of
the heat, had his coat
buttoned right to the neck
and his collar turned up.
The visitor was silent with
astonishment, but thespectre
grinned at him in an
amiable manner and he
faltered out at last :
“Who are you, and what
are you doing here ?”
“So glad you spoke,”
said the apparition, blandly.
“ You see I’m a ghost and,
of course, I can’t speak first.
Not allowed by the regula-
tions. Now, don’t be fright-
ened and run away, because
I want to do you a good
turn. How do you feel?
Quite well ?”
“You’re a ghost! But I
don’t believe in them. It’s a
joke.”
“Don’t be sceptical, young
man. Shall I walk through
the table or do any little
absurdity of that sort ? But,
no! you’ve more sense than
that. Listen ; Your brother-
in-law is a thief, you know,
but he is worse than you
think. He did not lose the
money the bank advanced
him. He has it all in a
cash-box under that stone.
Lift it up and see. He was
going to bolt. There is his
portmanteau.”
As in a dream, the live
man advanced and did as
the dead man directed him.
Sure enough, he lifted out a
weighty cash-box,
“If I were you,” said the
ghost, “I would go straight
to his house with that, and
make him open it in front
of your sister. His wife,
isn’t she?”
“Yes.”
“Poor woman? Well, good morning, my boy
Wish you luck.”
The young man halted at the door. “Is there
any little thing I can do, sir, to show my grati-
tude?”
“There is. Now and again, say at intervals of
a few months, persuade someone to come here
between midnight and daylight. A sceptic, if
possible. I won’t give them much of a fright.”
“Rely on me, I have half-a-dozen in my
mind’s eye already;” and he backed rather
rapidly out into the street.
“A nice young man,” said the ghost. “Now,
I wonder if that other fellow is coming back. If
ho wants to clear out before daylight he’ll face
anything to get that money.”
Sure enough, in about an hour’s time, the agent
came back. He had been somewhere in quest of
Dutch courage, and was pot-valiant. The candle
had gone out, but he lit another and glared round
the room.
“ Now, wh re are you?” he cried. “Come out
and frighten me again if you can. I’ve got some,
thing here for you.” Looking through the wall
the ghost saw that he was flourishing a revolver. ’
Cursing himself for a fool for running away
before, he put the weapon down and went to the
hearth. The cry he gave when he discovered his
loss was tremendous. He sprang to his feet, and
there, glaring at him across the table, was the old
man with the gashed throat. Then three shots
were fired in quick succession. Two of them went
through the spectre. The third went through the
agent.
There are two ghosts in that old house now.
One occupies the upper, and one the lower portion
—but they arc not on speaking terms.
DELCOMYN.


THE DEATH WATCH
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The only warning we had was Tom's tonified ex-
clamation aa he saw it coining.
The breeze had been blowing rather intermit-
tently all the time, with sudden gusts and calms
succeeded by a steady gale for about ten minutes,
and then long whispering pauses when the sails
flapped and her head shifted.
It was just after one of these short gusty blows
that there came a most extraordinary lull.
There was an absolute drop of the wind and the
sail fell flat, then there was a sort of plain head
wind more like the suction of a breakwater than
anything else I can think of, and then next
moment we all started alert at Tom’s low cry and
the whistle of the towering air-columns coming
“.full split ” upon our counter.
The four of us sitting on the ledge did what we
could at once, acting instinctively and letting go
the sail-ropes with frenzied haste.
Horsford held the tiller, and I believe that if he
hadn’t lost his head he might have saved us.
As it was I was just thinking to myself that I
would get out my knife and cut the mainsail ropes,
which had caught when we heeled right over, and
the next moment I was struggling under the boat
in the water.
When I got clear and ro-o to the surface, I
had at first nothing but an impression of the
boat upside-down, bending to one side with the
centreboard at the same angle, and the fellows
splashing about away from her.
Then I recognised Horsford just behind me,
Tom in front of me, and I could see Syd’s little
round shaven skull bobbing about a little beyond
him to the other side.
The same idea seemed to strike us all at once,
and despite the violent wind and churning sea we
all turned and made at the boat.
The bay swarmed with sharks, especially (it was
said) in the central part, into which flowed the
river and four or five creeks, the mouth of which
were the favourite haunts of fish.
The boat was a wretched old tub—a mere box,
built and tarred and pitched by the lads them'
selves, abominally leaky, and only susceptible of
any speed by reason*of the enormous stretch of
canvas she carried.
It was soon apparent that she would barely sup.
port us clinging on to her, let alone climbing upon
her, when at least our legs must hang in the water
as a bait to the sea-tigers—a most unnerving
reflection to me.
Horsford, the two lads, and I caught hold of
her bottom (keel she had none), and Syd. cried
out: —
“ Where’s Soule ?”
We all had a horrified, frightened look. Soule
couldn’t swim. He was the only one who couldn’t,
and there wasn’t a sign of him anywhere.
“Perhaps he’s under the boat,” said Tom.
“ Let’s try and turn her over.”
This I saw was only a waste of time.
The wind whistled and the feet of the squall
kept on stamping in the water, flattening it out
or churning it up, but the worst of it was past,
and I resolved to dive under the boat at once.
I shouted to Tom and Horsford, who were on
either side of me, and making no reply to Tom’s
exhortation to be careful, pushed off thrust
down my head, and with outstretched pointed
arms went under.
I came up on the other side a few yards off,
completely exhausted, and swam to the boat and
caught on next to Syd.
I shook my head.
“He’s not —there,” I shouted, breathing heavily,
“ I’m almost sure,”
We all had that soared look again, except Hors-
ford, who seemed taken up with something else,
or I do him an injustice.
Ten minutes or so later I dived again and Tom
followed me.
We both felt about under the boat, but could
find nothing.
The squall had now passed entirely, and there
was only a fresh wind blowing and a low, choppy
sea.
I was angry with Horsford and said to him
across the boat: —
“ Won’t you try, too?”
We looked at one another with all our old anta-
gonism and hatred.
“ No,” he said, sulkily; “ he’s drowned.”
And then we others began to realise the danger
and the misery of our situation.
11.
I must tell you something about Horsford and
myself.
Not much. For I don’t care to, as you will
understand when I begin by saying that we both
loved the same girl.
That is—Ethel, the lads’ sister. She married
Horsford.
This was two years ago, and it was her father
who managed it.
I don’t say Ethel loved me. I haven’t any right
to say so; but I believe that, if we had been left
alone and I had had fair play, things would have
ended differently.
Mr. Marquand is a business man, a station-agent
—one of the oldest-established firms in Brisbane,
and Horsford is his junior partner.
Hereford is a young Victorian and has plenty o
money, and (for his own reasons which were no
doubt as they were, in his own opinion, excellent)
he bought into the linn at the most critical moment
of its existence.
That was towards the close of the “ big drought.”
Bix months more of it, everybody said, would
have broken a good many stronger firms than
Marquand and Co., and Horsford (I am pretty
sure) saved it from bankruptcy.
My people have known the Marquands ever
since I can remember, and though we have grown
steadily poorer and they steadily richer, my
brother and I never knew, at any rate on the part
of Mrs. Marquand, Ethel and the lads, what it
was not to be welcome at their home.
Mr. Marquand (I can’t tell you why) was never
cordial to me ; but then he was never cordial to
anyone—except Horsford.
It is a long story, but it can easily be made a
short one.
Horsford became powerful at the Marquand’s,
and he soon made up his mind to “jump my
claim.”
I hate fashionable Victorians. They are such
snobs. They are very little better than English
people.
Horsford’s airs and graces sickened me, and the
lads, too; but something had come over Ethel.
I can’t explain it. X didn’t know, X only sus-
pected.
Anyhow, the result of his antagonism to me
could not long be doubtful. One of us had to go,
and he was the stronger.
He was always there, and always aggressive
against me, and, of course, I retaliated.
Then the family bought a house and a piece of
ground at Sandgate, and went down to live at the
Brisbane seaside resort (Sandgate was still going
ahead then before the other lines were opened up),
and the next thing was the announcement of his
engagement with Ethel.
That finished me.
I went off to Sydney full of bitterness and bad
temper, and I wrote a letter from there to her
which I shall regret until my dying day,
Horsford and she were married, and they went
to Melbourne (of course) for their honeymoon.
When I came up to Brisbane last autumn to
spend my holidays with my people, I had made up
my mind that I would see neither the Marquands
nor the Horsfords.
The Horsfords were living at Sandgate, too,
but right out of the town.
I went to Sandgate with my brother on a short
visit to the Bridges—he is engaged to Gerty
Bridge.
There I met the lads Tom and Syd., and I could
not break right away from them. They would
not let me. One thing led to another. They had
made a sailing-boat for themselves—the coffin
they called it, in jest, as it was long and black —
and they were always out in it with their friend
Soule, and they wanted me to come.
At last I agreed for that Saturday afternoon,
and they were to bring her along to the pier,
where I would join them.
When they arrived I saw that Horsford held the
tiller.
It appeared that Mrs. Marquand was anxious
about them, the weather being so uncertain, and
he insisted upon accompanying them.
That was the explanation he deigned to give me
in his sulky, supercilious way, when I got in, and
I have no doubt he knew as well as I did how
much I believed it.
111.
It was about an hour off sunset.
The day was exceptionally mild—hot even—
more like December or January than April.
So far I had not felt the coldness of the water
in the least. It was even pleasant.
But I knew that when the sun sank behind the
city and the dusty Bunya hills, and the western
night-breeze began to blow off the land, it might
become exceedingly cold.
The sea was quite calm and seemed to grow
calmer and calmer.
Unfortunately, we were drifting steadily right
out of the track of the steamers which traverse
the central and southern part of the bay. We
were going more and more north.
Not a sail —a funnel—was to be seen. Only far
off, beyond the islands to the south-east, a trail of
smoke floated, blurred and diffused—evidently
some steamer down at the bar passing out and
away.
t spoke to Tom.
“ Shall we stick here,” I said, “or swim for it ?
The chances are about equal.”
“ Syd. couldn’t manage it, ’he answered, “and
there’s the sharks.” I recognised the meaning of
the look on his face.
As we passed by St. Helena, the penal settle-
ment, he remarked to me that it was said, of all
the convicts who had escaped and tried to swim
from there to the land only one had succeeded,
and it was supposed that sharks were responsible
for the fact. On the other hand I thought I would
sooner chance them than remain in the water all
night and perhaps half the next day. Besides,
what could hinder them from grabbing us where
we were—for the coffin barely supported our
weight scarcely an inch of her being above water ?
The death of Soule and the realisation of our
danger had unnerved us. We remained quite still
and silent for several minutes. Then, once more
I proposed to swim for it and asked Syd. if he
thought he could do it? We could, I said, float
and rest wherever he wanted. But the lads were
afraid; they preferred to stick to the boat and
hoped to be sighted and picked up by someone.
The moon was already high in the heavens, and,
though in her last quarter, would, shining from
that cloudless sky and upon the waveless sea, give
us a fair chance.
This was Tom’s idea, but it struck me as ex-
tremely probable that after sunset we whould have
a winter haze rising up all over the land and hang-
ing over the water. For there had been a good
deal of rain during the last fortnight.
We spoke very little.
Horsford indeed never once broke silence but
clung on opposite me with his head and body
turned away, frowning with a sullen expression, as
I saw now and again as the hulk slewed round a
little.
We were still drifting north, being evidently in
the middle of a current and impelled by the
slight breeze from the south.
Then the sun dropped in a golden mist behind
the hills. The light waned, then grew clearer
again in the after-glow, and finally died away.
Syd.’s teeth were chattering loudly, and his face
and hands were like those of a corpse. At last he
said : “I can't hold on much longer, Tom.”
I let go and swam round to him and, with
Tom’s help, lifted him up higher into the hulk.
The poor little lad was quite exhausted, and I
felt sure that the coffin was unable to support the
whole of his weight. And so it turned out.
What was to be done ?
Tom and I got on either side of him and sup-
ported him, but soon he altogether let go with his
hands, and the strain of his weight upon us was
dreadful.
Hours passed, or so it seemed. The moon shone
out down in the west, and, as I had expected the
sky became thick with haze. I felt quite numbed
and paralysed.
Syd. seemed unconscious, lying heavily back
upon me.
The stars were coming out quickly all over the
sky, while the haze grew denser and spread more
and more across the water. At last you could
scarcely see the land at all, and round us it was
almost dark.
Suddenly Tom whispered hoarsely : “I must let
go, Bob.” And before I could answer a word we
all three fell backwards into the water and went
under.
I clutched at Syd. with my left hand, but he
got loose, being held, I supposed, by Tom.
I cannot say what happened for several minutes
then. It was all like a horrible slow nightmare-
dream in which I laboured heavily.
When I got back to the punt I saw Tom a little
way off, swimming wearily like a dog.
I called to him ; he saw me, turned a little, and
approached. His breath came and went in rat-
tling spasms. He said something, but my own
noisy breath and the whirling in my ears prevented
me from hearing what it was.
He repeated it. “ Where’s Syd. ?” he said.
All I could reply was to groan out : “ My God !”
I wish I had died first.
Without a word, he lifted up his hands over bis
head and went straight down.
And I could do nothing. That was the terrible
part of it. I was numbed and paralysed. I closed
my eyes and thought of following him.
IV.
I do not know what did it or how long after this
it was, but the time came when I all at once
p eemed to awake with a start.
I found Horsford staring at me across the hulk.
I could see his face dusky-grey with a faint light
in it.
I could sea his eyes, and recognised how hate
fully they were staring at me.
The sea all round was lit up with phosphor-
escence. Little points of it, like handfuls of millet-
sead, ware strewn here and there, and the outline
of the boat, where it gently rose and fell and
struck the water, was like bright silver.
The moon was approaching the edge of a
great haze and shone clearly, surrounded by the
larger stars in a faint irregular white spheroid,
while outside this the other stars in masses scin-
tillated brilliantly, particularly in the extreme
north, south, and east. We were quite motionless,
or, if anything, were drifting slowly westward
towards the land, despite the contrary evening
breeze.
The whole thing grew upon me. It had struck
him from the first. The tide was on the turn.
We had fallen away from the northerly back
current, and were now about to be carried by the
flow right into the land. He had foreseen this,
and realised that being saved was merely a
question of endurance. He had, therefore,
doggedly refused to waste one jot or tittle of his
strength in an effort to save the rest, or any of us.
Do not think me mad when I say that, as we
two clung there and stared at one another, I could
feel his heart and brain beating against mine.
An hour dragged on. Two hours. Three, for
all I can tell. It appeared more like thirty. We
were moving steadily westwards —backward and
forward—staring at one another, rigid with cold
and hatred.
He was asking himself when I should let go and
sink ? And I was making up my mind that if I
felt myself failing, I would swim round and seize
him and drag him down with me.
I thought of abominable names for him—coward,
hound, skunk and villain were the mildest—
abusing myself as a besotted fool for not having
understood it all before.
And still we clung there, staring at one another.
Suddenly I began to laugh. It was not only for
life and the sake of life that we were fighting this
tremendous duel. It was for love, and the sake
of love. On that far shore to which we were
steadily but surely drifting, there stood the form
of the woman we both loved. She was for the
survivor, the conqueror.
What made him sick with rage was the idea
that if he perished and I lived to marry her I
should have all his money as well.
That was what made me laugh.
I would not have touched a penny of his if I
were starving; but it was glorious to let him
torture himself with the idea that I would get it
all. That hurt him even more than the idea of
my marrying Ethel.
Oh, how I read and understood their married
life now! How I realised the abject failure of
this cowardly brute to break the spirit of the girl
whom he had won by such infamous means !
Yes, she had loved me all along. I saw it now.
I saw her sacrifice herself to save her father from
bankruptcy and ruin, and, perhaps, worse (dark
and sinister rumours which I had heard and
rejected came back to me). Oh, my brave mv
beautiful love !
The moon had fallen right into the bank of the
haze which was rising imperceptibly. And now
she was near the hills behind the far-off city, shin-
ing feebly, a dusky-gold and rayless crescent. The
stars above us were clear and innumerable right
down to the edge of the haze, where they shone
few and faint and presently disappeared. The
hulk was turning upon itself, drifting along end-
ways, instead of sideways.
Both of us were desperately weary. I fell at
last, despite all I could do to prevent it, into a
sort of sleep or stupor.
I breathed heavily and regularly to a tune which
I have forgotten, but which repeated itself again
and again and again—perpetually, endlessly.
Once or twice I wondered to myself if both of us
would let go soon and fall asleep together in the
water ?
I forgot all about him. I hated him no more. I
even liked and pitied him. I shut my eyes and let
my cheek rest on the wood of the hulk, and then
for some time I forgot. • Perhaps I really did fall
asleep, I cannot say.
I was awakened by the rocking of the boat. I
looked and saw that he was trying to climb up
into it.
He was quite weak and worn-out; as weak and
worn out as I was.
The moon had set. There was no light but that
of the stars and of the phosphorescence in the water,
but several of the stars were very brilliant and had
long wakes. I could see all the outline of his body
and limbs in silver as he moved trying to climb up.
I merely watched him. I could do nothing, or
at any rate I did not care to try.
At last he got up and the hulk sank lower.
He was at the bow and balanced himself, but
did it clumsily for he had not the strength to get
over it; he sprawled right across in pulling him-
self up. His hand touched my arm and he
stopped. This was the last round of our death
duel, and we knew it; but were both utterly ex-
hausted.
If he got there and kept there, what then ? I
tried to think what I should do.
Before I could make up my mind (I was still
half-asleep, or seemed so) he lifted himself up and
struck me with his right hand half clenched.
I moved aside; the hulk rocked; he swayed,
and toppled right over into the water.
I merely watched him —fascinated.
He sank slowly, with his arms stretched out and
up. His face was towards me, his head thrown
back. He was completely outlined in the phos-
phorescence. I could see every outspread finger—
his mouth—his eyes—his hair. Three streams of
small silver bubbles ran forth from his mouth and
nostrils as he went steadily down—down-down—
oh, my God ! down into the darkness of the pit.
It was beautiful and terrible beyond expression.
Shall I always see the arms and outspread
fingers stretched up to me—these streaming bub
bles from the mouth and nostrils of that head
thrown back ?
I shut my eyes, clinging to the hulk, and tried
not to see them, but to sleep and forget.
But when someone seized me (it was Stephens,
the Pine Creek fisherman) and dragged me into
his boat (which I remember vaguely, and also the
grey dawn-light instead of the stars and haze), I
still saw them a,nd besought him to jump in and
dive and pull him out.
You know the rest.

WOMAN’S EIGHTS— BY A MALICIOUS MAN.


A CRIME
IN
INK
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
When your generous offer of £5 weekly
for a series of short stories came, sir, Florence
(my wife) and I decided, after some discussion, to
accept it. “You shall do the men,” she said,
“and I will do the women ; and as for the local
colouring that he talks about, we can manu-
facture that.” When I suggested that I might
possibly help her with the women, knowing some-
thing of the sex, she threw me a smile tinged with
satire. Anyhow, your offer was accepted, and
that afternoon we ordered a new drawing-room
carpet and a piano on the strength of it.
You will remember how well things went for
the first three weeks. “The Lucky Digger,”
“The Reformed Gambler,” and “The Repent-
ant Prodigal ” have, as short stories, I venture to
say, seldom been equalled in English literature.
They were the outcome of a system. We
Florence and I, slept with note-books beneath our
pillows, and one or other of us would awaken
frequently during the night with a “Sh!!—l
have an idea.” We rode by night on the front
seats of trams and fed our brains on fish, hence the
excellence of those ideas.
* * «
Well, sir, the fourth week came, and it
was my turn to find the plot. My conception was
of a widower of 42 and his son of 21 living to-
gether on terms of perfect equality as men about
town, sharing alike sorrows and joys, loves and
and dinners, incomes and sodas. I introduced, of
course, a girl, a clean, fresh, primrose-scented
thing from the country. She sold flowers from a
shop in Burlington Arcade and my heroes fell
simultaneously in love with
her; but their loves were as
pure and chaste as the
flow'ers she sold. The sub-
ject was never mentioned
between them until one day
they met at the Criterion
corner. Both had been to
see her. “Look here,” the
old fellow said, as he took
the youngster’s arm, with a
kindly pressure, “it is ab-
surd our fooling about Alice
any longer. I hate compet-
ing with you. Let us make
a dead-beat of it and edu-
cate her between us.”
And so £2OOO was put
aside and the girl sent to a
private school at Highgate.
All the week she worked at
her lessons, and on Sundays
came down to their chambers
in Gray’s Inn, when the two
men, Naaman-like, plunged
into the torrent of her clean
love for them. Then, in
fulfilment of the drama’s
necessity, bankruptcy over-
took the men, and the girl
came into money, and the
completion of the story
demanded that she should
marry one of them.
I looked across to Florence
and asked “ Which?”
She, somehow, had fallen
desperately in love with the
old fellow, and decided, in
the spasmodic way most
women have, that the girl
should be his.
To me this was unnatural
and a sin against art and
I tried in a gentle way to
lead her to my way of think-
ing. She was first obstinate,
then angry and at last tempestuous, and, rising
from her chair, marched to the door, and, swing-
ing round, said with the slow, calm eloquence of
autocracy : “As the girl is of my making, I sup-
pose I can do as -I like with her, and I have
finally decided that the elder man shall marry
her.” With this she left me, and for hours I
heard her pacing her bedroom muttering I know
not what.
As for me, I paced the study and wrestled with
the destiny of these people. Suddenly a golden
means suggested itself. The girl should marry
neither, but die to slow music, leaving her vast
wealth to be equally divided between them.
And the two men, the old and the young,
should mingle their tears over her grave and be
bound together by the everlasting bond of a
common sorrow.
Impelled by this inspiration, Alice died rapidly
I killed her at twelve that night, and, placing
t he MS. in my desk, I went to bed, but not to
leep. The curse of Cain hung about me as a
garment, and every approach to unconsciousness
was rendered hideous and dreadful by the sad,
reproachful face of the dead Alice peering
through the darkness with an et iu Brute expres-
sion.
Towards morning tiredness won for me
an hour of sleep, and I awoke at half-past five
with a start to find myself alone. Florence had
gone. I rushed to the study and found her stand-
ing over the desk on which lay the story. She
was a personification of Millais’ “Yes or No,”
soaked in sadness. Turning to me as I entered,
she said in clear, deep cut, copper-plate, simply
this, “So you have killed her ! May God foi’give
you !” and left the room.
Although I had felt like a whipped hound
before, I had never realised until that moment the
actual depth of degradation to which I had sunk-
I had, in cold blood and at midnight, murdered
this young, innocent thing of our own making.
A restlessness like that of Eugene Aram took
possession of me. I dressed hurriedly, and tried
in the open air to find some forgetfulness. In
vain. At half-past eight I returned to find
Florence gone. She had left a note on the dining-
room table, saying that she “ had decided to stay
for a while at the Rogers’, not feeling quite safe in
the house after what had happened .”
This was on the Tuesday. That day, Wednes-
day and Thursday formed a trinity of black-letti r
days never to be forgotten. I wrote to her
repeatedly, imploring her to return. I said —
“Only come back to me and the girl shall marry
whomever you may choose.” I said—“ Come,
only come, Florence, and see me wash away this
blood-stain in the salt tears of repentance, and I
will do anything and everything by way of repai’a-
tion.” To these letters I received no reply.
* * *
One day I met in the street a son of my
wife’s host, who “cut me dead.” This was too
much. That I had been guilty of a gross
crime against Florence there was no disputing.
That I had murdered the child of her brain,
loved by her well and wisely, was a truth burnt
into my memory by each succeeding hour of con-
sciousness. But what had this interfering fool to
do with it! The girl was our own, a denizen of a
world where Florence and I reigned supreme,
giving unto this one wealth, to another poverty,
throwing laughter here, tears there, and weeding
out the impossible with the hoe of Death, and his
interference was simply impious. I turned and
followed him, demanding some explanation.
“ Turning to me as I entered the said, ‘So you have killed her! May God forgive you !’”
“What right have you,” Tasked, “to treat me
in this way ? ”
“Aright,” he Replied, “in common with the
rest of my sex to protest against the illtreatment
of a defenceless woman.”
“ Which of them ? ” I hissed, presuming that he
knew all.
He curled his lip and said, “You need not fear
that your confidence has been broken. My sisters
have gleaned their information from the night-
ravings of a woman’s brain, tortured with the
memory of some hideous injustice done to one
named * Alice.’ Now do you understand ? ”
I left him and went back to my loveless home,
threw myself upon the couch and stared at the
ceiling, and saw there a possible door of escape
gradually open itself. The darkness faded, a
delicious sense of coming pleasure pervaded the
room through. I saw in the resurrection of Alice a
possible renewal of the old order. That night
Alice rose again, and the younger of the two
Bohemians died, and died ,as heroes should,
slowly, poetically, and of consumption. Through-
out his illness the two of them took him to little
dinners at Ivetner’s, matinees, and for drives in
the Park. Then he sank away in the old
chambers, on cither side of him the others stood,
and as his breath came and went fitfully, and that
light, the newer light of another world, kindled
in the bottom of his eyes, he joined their hands,
and, turning to the old fellow, said, “We have
ate, drank, loved, laughed, lived, and liked life
well; but it is all over now. Take her, take care
of her for both oursakes”—and then passed away.
# * *
I finished the story, and taking the last
train to town, found you, if you will remember,
sir, in your den. You know how I pleaded for
its immediate publication, how I fell upon my
knees and told you that the happiness of a whole
family was at stake. Your good heart gained the
upper hand of you, and on the Thursday the story
of “Tithonus Junior” went forth to the world.
I need scarcely say the goddess, Sleep, forsook me
that night. It was half-past five before I could
get a copy of your paper, the paper that was
to bring peace and a wife back to me. I took
it to the Gardens and told the trees and
flowers of it, and the flowers dried their eyes.
Above me was a new heaven, and beneath abetter
earth, and all sang to me with one accord—
“ Alice lives! Alice lives!” and the trees whis-
pered the same glad tidings.
At half-past ten I was pacing the drawing-room
in happy expectation of something—what I hardly
knew—when the bell rang and the girl handed
me a telegram worded as follows : “ Come and see
your wife at once.” The signature was that of a
local medical man. Another hour found me at
the Rogers’ gate, and there pacing the lawn was
the doctor himself. Noticing his anxious face I
rushed to him with “Has anything serious
happened ? ” “ No,” he replied, with a tremulous
sigh of relief. “The worst is over, the crisis past,
but stay here, I will announce you.”
When he returned he told me the terrible his-
tory of Florence’s illness; how she had come
down to a condition of utter prostration, and
drifted slowly into brain-fever, of her ravings
about some injustice done, some murder perpe-
trated.
In the dining-room I heard of my poor wife’s
recovery. The acute attack had lasted, it
appeared, until half-past eight that morning,
when she fell into a quiet sleep. Miss Rogers
and the nurse were standing at the foot of the bed,
and talking in an undertone of some story in that
morning’s paper, when suddenly the patient
awoke with a start, and shouted in a half-maniacal
way, “ Bring it to me, read it to me! ” The nurse
thought it wise to accede to her request. The
story was read, and with this marvellous result
that when the wedding of some stupid couple was
reached the patient burst into tears, and the crisis
was passed.
“Eu fc follow me, you shall see her yourself.”
said Miss Rogers.
* * #
The room into which they led me was
daikened, and it was some seconds before my eyes
were sufficiently accustomed to the light to realise
my surroundings. Then I saw the trained nurse
in uniform moving with that alarming stealthy
tread of her tribe. On the table a basket of white
flowers, an ice-bag, some champagne and medicine
and on the bed Florence herself, one cold, ivory-
white shoulder peeped out, and about it her
goiden hair lay thick and radiant like sunbeams
that blushed when caught in the act of kissing
some chaste mountain top while men slept. The
great eyes of her moved in the quiet face as
restive prisoners who peep between prison-bars.
With a languid wave of her hand she dismissed
the nurse and Miss Rogers, and then beckoned me
to come round to her. I fell upon my knees at
her pillow s side, and for a few moments we were
snent as she ran her fingers through my curls
carrying love and forgiveness. Then she drew my
head nearer and, with what strength she had,
whispered : lam so-so-happy-and lam sure
Alice is—l thank you for her sake; ” then, after a
pause, and in a suppliant way : “Don’t vou think
dearest, it would be safer if for the future we con-
fined ourselves strictly to Comedy ? ”

“ Frenchy"-A Chapter from Real Life.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
“Frenchy!”
“ Damn !”
“Frenchy, dear, you’re dying, you know.”
“ Gimme some rum.”
“ There isn’t any more.”
“Go’n get some.”
“Listen, dear. Father Fitz. is coming round
this evening .”
“Mick, dear, get me some rum.”
“ Don’t have any more, Mary,”
“ If you don’t get it I’ll crawl out myself.”
“ Well, I’ll get it, but ”
“ Get it, then.”
He took the bottle and went out. She was so
petulant, but then she was so ill. Besides, the
pain must have been terrible. He had not known
her long, and she was not a very good girl—her
husband was in gaol and the factory was no place
to acquire a polish at —but he looked through her
brown eyes, right back to where the love was, and
thought nothing would matter if she could only
live a little longer. The pain w r as creeping up to
her heart every time she moved.
“ Asleep, Frenchy ? ”
“No, dear.” Then suddenly, “Mick, how will
Matt, know ? ’
“ About you? ”
“Yes. Poor devil, he won’t be out for three
months, and before then I’ll ”
“Don’t say it, Frenchy, don’t say it.”
“ Well, damn it, how will he know ? ”
“I’ll tell him.”
“ You! ”
“Yes, dear. Here’s the rum.”
“Damn the rum ; I don’t want it. Mick, did
I ever tell you I loved Matt. ? ”
“ Yes —but long ago.”
“ He told me I wasn’t his wife.”
“Don’tcry, Frenchy.”
“ If I could see him now ”
“I thought you loved me.”
“ So I do, dear, when I don’t think of him.”
“ But he doesn’t care twopence for you,
Frenchy. ”
“ Well, that’s why I love him—l s’pose. Gimme
some ruin now, Miqk,”
“ Water, Frenchy ? ”
“ Little, please—don’t drown it. Mick, you’re
a good sort; I wish I was on my legs again—for
your sake.”
“ Don’t, Frenchy.”
“ I wonder who’ll be there, Mick.”
“ Where, dear?”
“At my funeral. Don’t do that, Mick—you
told me not to cry just now. Mick, will you get
some of those flowers we used to get up at
Malvern ? Why don’t you answer ? ”
“I—l can’t.”
“ Well, you'll be there anyway, Mick—l can see
that.”
“ I hope not, Mary.”
“Oh, what’s the use of hoping ; of course you
will. Some more rum, Mick.”
‘ ‘ You’ll get drunk, dear. ”
“What’s it got to do with you? I’ll chuck
this glass at you in a minute.”
“ Well, chuck it, if it’ll do you any good.
Oh, Frenchy ! ”
“I didn’t mean to, Mick. Come here and show
me. Oh, Mick, I might have cut your eye out.
How it’s bleeding ! Get the looking-glass, dear,
there—on the shelf. Does it hurt you mucli ? ”
“Not much, Frenchy. You were in pain when
you did that, weren’t you ? ”
“No; temper, that’s all. Forgive me, Mick.
I do love you—better than Matt.”
“ True, Mary ? ”
“S’elp me God—you’re so good to me.”
“ And your husband wasn’t.”
“Damn him, Mick, what’ll you do when I'm
gone ?”
“Go, too.”
“No, you won’t. You’ll get a wife, and forgot
about Frenchy.”
“ I don’t think so, dear.”
“ Well, I’d like to think you wouldn’t. Mick,
I wonder if people can think in hell ?”
“ Oh, Frenchy!”
“ I wonder if people want to be alive after they
die, or are glad to stay dead?”
“ Don’t talk like that, Mary.”
“ No, it’s cruel. I’m always hard with you,
dear, but it’s because I’m so ill, I s’pose. But I’m
fond of you, old fellow. If Matt, was to come
here now, I wouldn’t care a curse for him. Mick,
I hear someone walking outside.”
“Father Fitz, I s’pose.”
“ Well, I don’t want to see him, Mick.”
“ He’s bound to come in, Mary.”
“Well, I’ll shut my eyes and gammon I’m
asleep. He won’t stay long then.”
“ Does Mrs. Hornby live here?”
“ Yes, but she’s asleep,”
“ Matt. !”
“ Mary !”
“ Who’s this ?”
“ Only a friend, Matt,—come to see me ’cause
I’m ill.”
“ Friend, be damned ! You’d better go,”
“Yes, go, please, Mick.”
“ Go, be ”
“ Won't you go ?”
“No.”
“ Then, by hell, I’ll make you.”
“ Mick, Matt., don’t fight.”
“ He’s got to go.”
“ You’ve got to make me.”
“Well, I will. I’ve broke gaol to see my
missus, and I’m going to see her—alone. You’re
not wanted any longer. ”
“ But I’ll stay all the same.”
“By God, you won’t. Put that bottle down.”
“ Not much.”
“ What have you got to do with my wife ? ”
“Nothing.”
“Looks like it. Going to put that bottle
down ? ”
“No.”
“Then ”
“ Matt. ! ”
“ Frenchy ! Frenchy ! My God, look !- she’s
dying ! —she’s dead ! ”
“My cursed luck ! ”
“And mine . ”
Next day they took Matt, back to gaol, while
Mick sat beside anew grave wondering if Frenchy
would be glad to stay dead.
WALTER L'ESTKANGE.


Another Esau!
A Tale of a Trip Home.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
A dreary open plain in Northern Victoria,
pustuled over with yellow mounds of earth, where
men have dug for alluvial gold—and put their
hopes “to bed with a shovel ” —around them the
black crows as mutes still lingering, and no
vegetation but here and there a gum-tree. No
habitation but our hut, no colour but the dark
sage-green body-pigment that Nature rubs into
new canvas before she paints her flowers, and no
life but our two selves, and one of us dying ; such
were the surroundings.
The man dying was my mate, Jim. Jim was a
name of my selecting, and fitted him, for, like
another Jim of whom we all have read, he was
“long-legged and ornery.” His father who, at the
date of registration, had not my advantage of
seeing him as an adult, had christened him
Marriott Barry Gilmore.
Jim and I had prospected together for ten years,
and barely earned “ tucker,” and now, just as we
had made our first real find in the ranges beyond,
and were waiting for the assay, Jim had caught
the fever and was babbling of his people at
home. At his request I had been reading to
him some of his mother’s letters —religious letters
into which God’s universal love for men had
been focussed by a mother’s heart. I had finished
the last of them ; young, wholesome Morning,
hating Death, was lingering behind the hills ; the
winds, waiting with their chariot for the soul of
the man, ran round and round the house, shook
the windows and doors and flapped the roof in
their impatience, when Jim gathered together
what of life he had, turned round and, giving me
his hand, said, “ If the reef does carry a lot, don't
forget them —good-bye.” The winds quieted
down, and the day came to find me alone.
# » #
The reef, the since celebrated Lone Hand,
did carry a lot. It was two feet thick six feet
down, and at the water-level was half as wide
again, and crushed 4oz. to the ton. Six montl s
from Jim’s death I sold out for £50,000,
and stood, an hour after I had deposited the
money in the bank, at the corner of Collins-street,
Melbourne, the loneliest and most miserable man
on the face of God’s earth. During the long
years that I had been hunting for gold, I had
been dropping friends ; all but Jim had left me,
and now, just as luck came, he went. I had lost
more than my friends —I had lost my social
instincts, my capacity to love and be loved ; I
had no vices, and yet I was a social outcast and a
millionaire, I wandered into Scott’s and “ordered
something as I sat in the vestibule, thinking of
Jim, the idea seized me that, next to the old
chap’s self, I would like to see his people, who,
although I had never met them, were, from years
of converse, well-known to me—Jim’s solid father,
his good mother, and Florence, the red-haired
baby, had come to be spoken of as though my
own relations. So I decided to go home at once,
and look them up.
The feeling of loneliness that, like a malignant
entity, lay somewhere near my heart, grew
heavier and heavier as I neared England. On
board ship the ladies, whose hands I would have
given anything to touch, avoided me—empty-
headed, well-dressed, little globe-trotters made
all the running, and I loathed them. In London
it was worse. Even the cabmen thought an
invitation to ride would be wasted enterprise.
The people in Regent-street stared, and the waiters
made remarks to each other; so, in two days I
started for Sussex to look my old mother up.
Eighteen years I had been away, and yet the old-
fashioned village nestled in the hollow of the hills
was as though I had left it but yesterday; the
cows were feeding as then; the windmill on the
hill might never have stopped; farm-labourers
trudged home from work with trousers tied around
below the knee ; the little trout-stream, that I had
dreamt of so often in the scorching days and
nights of Australia, sang the same old song. I
stopped on the bridge a moment and asked a
labourer who passed me if it (the stream) held any
trout. “It did, but not of late years.” I led him
on a bit, and he told me that “ he minded the
time that young Charley Dawson (that’s me) used
to catch a couple of dozen afore breakfast. ”
“ Where is young Dawson now ?” I asked,
“ Oh, he went to ’Stralia and left his old mother,
who lives in the cottage there” (pointing to a
two-roomed hut near). “ She’s on the parish, so
he warn’t o’ much account.”
“Butwhat about the money she had?”
“She took a little farm called Ockham, and lost
it all.”
Then I walked on to the cottage and found
mother sleeping at the fireside with her mouth
open.
After a time I succeeded in awakening her and
made her understand that I was her son Charley.
She called me “ Sir,” and said she was glad I had
eome back, as the damp had taken to strike up
from the kitchen floor, and I might do something.
“You was always handy with your hands.” She
asked me how I left all my friends, and if they
had much “ rheumatiz” out there.
I made all arrangements for mother’s comfort,
and the following afternoon found me at Sheer-
in-Surrey, and near the little farm where Jim’s
people lived. As I neared the house I could see
two women whom I rightly conceived to be
Florence and her mother watering flowers upon
the lawn. The old lady was in her second child-
hood, and Florence (I knew her by her red hair)
helped with exceeding tenderness to carry her
watering-can from place to place. I reached the
wall without being observed and sat down under
it for ten minutes—another Peri seeking Paradise.
The wall was but four feet in height, but it
separated God's best gift, the quiet content of
domestic love, from the earth’s worst curse, the
inaudible groanings of a social derelict.
Suddenly the voices stopped, and I rose. The
mother had gone in, and the girl was in the door-
way—
Half light, half shade,
She stood, a sight to make an old man young.
Seeing me she walked across to where I was stand-
ing and asked me if I wanted to see her father.
Driven by some sudden, inexplicable impulse, I
looked her straight in the face and said, “ Yes, I
am his son, your brother Marriott.”
Florence at first stepped back, as though to run
in doors and announce me, then her good heart
drove her to the wall, and leaning over she threw
her arms about my neck and drew me into Jim’s
heritage, the Heaven of her love for him.
“ You must not come in yet,” she said, when
the first rush of her welcome was over, “ father is
very ill, and the shock might be too much for him.
Stay hero, I will see mother.”
In five minutes the old lady, who had grown
grey praying for us, was crossing the lawn
to meet me, and then my face was drawn
down by her long, thin fingers to hers, and held
there till the trembling was past; then, with a
deep breath, she released me. “Marriott, my
prayers are answered —your father will see you
before lie dies and give you his blessing.”
Hand in hand we walked across the lawn and
into the dining-room. As we entered she whis-
pered, “ Your father is paralysed, but I think he
will know you.” In the square chimney-corner,
with Florence kneeling on the farther side of him,
the old man sat staring at the smouldering logs
and trying to understand something of the strange
news the girl had told him—news of his son’s
return.
“Here ho is, father, so strong and well. He
will help you with the farm, and it will begin to
pay again, and you will get better, and we shall
all be so happy,” and she stroked the lifeless
hand nearest her. At the old woman’s bidding, I
knelt, too, and she, bending her mouth to his ear,
HERE’S PATHOS FOR YOU.
OLD DRUNK; “I’ve not much longer to
live, your Worchip; God will not
spare me many hours.”
WORTHY MAGISTRATE (choking with emotion ):
“Well, I’ll give you ten days.”
said—“ John, here’s Marriott come back—wont
you bless him ?”
He turned his head round towards me, and
peered inquiringly as through a fog; then a ripple
of consciousness ran through his years, and the
hand nearest me, that had some life left, moved
as though to find me in his darkness; the old lady
gently bent my head and placed his hand on it.
Then he muttered something and fell back.
« * *
Strange as it may appear, in the delicious
joy of a common sorrow and the excitement of
the few days that followed old Gilmore’s death,
which took place the next day, the money
question was either forgotten or thought
of only when I was alone. Sometimes the
three of us would sit together in the chimney
corner, and while one of my hands was being
fondled by the old lady, the fingers of the other
would lose themselves in Florence’s bounteous
hair; at others, my new sister and I would
wander about the garden, through the dairy, or
over the farm, intensely, if silently, happy. The
fact was, Peri had found a paradise, whose streets
were paved with something better than gold.
Old Gilmore died on the Tuesday, and on the
following Saturday he was borne on the shoulders
of his labourers to his first freehold.
The funeral over, I had time to look round and
re-ebnsider my position.
To me the most shocking feature of it was that
my love for Florence had outgrown the limits of
brotherhood, and my own deception had made all
other dreams impossible, I could not go back
now and say “ Florence, I am not your brother; I
have crept into your heart and taken your father’s
blessing under false pretences,” and so write
myself down a liar.
Thoughts of this order rushed in upon me as I
wandered back from the churchyard. The will
was, I remembered, to be read at three o’clock ;
and, from hints that had been dropped, I fancied
the old man’s monetary affairs were in anything
but a satisfactory condition ; but this fact should
be rather helpful to me than otherwise under the
circumstances. With the material at my disposal it
should be possible to build a golden bridge across
that terrible abyss that separates the kingdom of
brotherhood from that other land the lover
dreams of.
As I neared the door ( saw Florence awaiting
me. “ Can you,’’she said, “ postpone your dinner
for half-an-hour, and come with me to the summer-
house? ”
“ I can, Florence; but why do you look so white
and anxious ? ”
“You will not wonder when you hear our
father’s will.”
“Never mind the will, Florence, I will put
that all right.”
“You, Marriott! You, poor boy! Ah, you
little know.”
We were in the summer-house now, and Florence
standing in front of me ; suddenly she threw her
arms around my neck and burst into tears. Then,
when her sobbing was over, she sat beside me and
said, “You don’t know what it is for me to have
a brother again, and yet for your own sake I wish
you had not come. ’Tis not fair that you should
start a new life with a mother and sister on your
hands and debts to pay.” Then she leaned on my
shoulder again and cried bitterly ; “ Poor father,
it killed him, and it will kill mother, too, when
she hears the worst.”
Slowly the fact dawned on me that this next
hour was to be my Waterloo; but the winning
of it demanded more generalship than I felt
possessed of.
“Florence, will you run indoors and let me
think this matter over ? ”
She kissed me and left for the house, but before
he had gone 20 y;irds I called her back, and put-
ting my hands upon her shoulders said : “At a
rough guess how much do you think it will take
to square up father’s affairs ? ”
Florence turned white and red alternately, and
then, taking one lapel of my coat in each of her.
hands, leant forward and, looking upon the
around, said : “ I don’t know—l am afraid to tell
you; but, I should think, two thousand pounds ”
I could not refrain from laughing two
thousand pounds, and I had twenty-five thou-
sand of hers at my disposal at that moment.
“ Marriott, you are either very hardened or
very mysterious ; to me this condition of things is
absolutely hopeless. ”
She was leaving ; but the temptation to ante-
date my prerogative by just a few hours was
irresistible; so, drawing her to my breast, I kissed
her teal’s away, called her “ my own ” (omitting
the “sister ”), and told her not to be afraid —that
something, I was sure, would turnup ; and then I
sent her away.
There were only ten minutes before the meeting
commenced, and no plans could be formed in that
time, so I ran in the back way up into my room to
brush my hair.
In the next room there were two loud-voiced
men, whose conversation was distinctly audible.
They, I gathered, were the executors, and one of
them spoke very angrily of some bill for six hun-
dred pounds, for which he had no security.
Putting my cheque-book in my pocket I followed
these men down stairs.
In the little room opposite to the dining-room, I
saw Florence talking to some stranger, whose
back was towards me. She heard my step, and,
turning round, rushed out; her face was aglow
with smiles, brilliant as the rising sun. “ Some-
thing has turned up!” she whispered, and was
gone again.
In the room some half-a-dozen men were sitting
around the table; the old lady was at the head of
it, and as I entered she motioned me to take the
seat on her right. Then Florence came, and with
her a man—a square-shouldered son of the sea, in
captain’s uniform. They took two seats on the
old lady’s left.
Florence’s eye was still sparkling with some new
joy. I saw that her hand was wandering beneath
the table, and, finding his, both faces brightened
simultaneously. In that moment the truth
dawned, and the light of my life went out.
The man at the bottom of the table opened the
proceedings by reading the will.
Old Gilmore had left the whole of his property
to his wife, for her lifetime, and at her death it
was to be equally divided between his son Mar-
riot, if still living, and his daughter Florence. He
directed that the family Bible, his watch and
chain and seals, should be sent to his son at once.
As the executor closed the will he coughed
significantly and, as wo all know, was about to
explain the altered condit : on of the estate, when
the captain rose and my chance was gone. He
told them that as the fiancee of Miss Gilmore it
was his privilege to settle up the estate of the
deceased, and if any gentleman present had any
claim upon the estate he would gladly settle it,
either now or to-morrow morning.
From that the meeting drifted into a wine-
drinking, speech-making affair, which did not
interest me, I was about to leave the room when
Florence rose and, coming up to the back of my
chair, put one hand on both of my shoulders, and,
leaning down, whispered, “You said something
would turn up; come over and let me introduce
you to it.” Then she kissed me, and the face of
the man darkened.
I rose as freely as my heavy heart would allow
me, and followed her round to where he was
sitting, knowing that it was to meet my doom.
He rose at my approach and drew back from us.
“ I want to introduce my brother Marriott to
you, Alfred.”
Ere Florence could finish the introduction, he
of the square shoulders moved towards the door,
and when nearing it, turned round and said, “ I
should like to have a few words with you alone,
sir.” Then he led the way to the summer house,
and I followed like a hound already whipped.
Once well out of the house, he turned sharply
round on me.
“ I think, sir, you are playing the part of a
d d scoundrel. Marriott Gilmore died in Aus-
tralia, seven months since.”
“ He did—and I am playing his hand.”
“ And who are you?”
“ I am Charles Dawson, his partner.”
“ That’s another lie —Charles Dawson came
home with fifty thousand pounds.”
“ I am Charles Dawson, and have a bank receipt
for that sum in my pocket-but may I explain?”
“Explain! Explain!! I think if you have
that sum, and were about to let this poor family
be sold up, it would require more than even your
ingenuity to explain it satisfactorily. No, not
another word. I will give you half-an-hour; if
you are not gone then I will horsewhip you, and
then send for the police.”
He was leaving me, when I stopped him :
“May I not give Miss Gilmore a cheque for
her dead brother’s half ?”
His whole attitude reeked with contempt.
“Miss Gilmore’s hands are clean, and will
remain so.”
Again I followed him. “May I not wish her
good—”
Before I could finish he had felled me like a
bullock. When I came to myself I was alone j
under a hedge, near the house—if I had crawled
there or been helped I know not, but I was there—
and crept through it like a criminal sneaking from
justice. It was a summer’s night, but a summer’s
storm had gathered over me. As I trudged to the
station there quivered ever and again bright
flashes of lightning, like the rod of vengeance
Adam saw driving him from Eden. The heavens
wept, and I too; but mine were “salt tears
strange to shed. ”
In a half-numbed state I got back to London
and thence to Melbourne, and now my only hope
is that they may read this and forgive me, s°

MANNINGTON CAFFYN.
A Mountain Station.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
I bought a run a while ago,
On country rough and ridgy,
Where wallaroos and wombats grow—
The Upper Murrumbidgee.
The grass is rather scant, it’s true,
But this a fair exchange is,
The sheep can see a lovely view
By climbing up the ranges.
And “She-oak Flat’s ” the station’s name
I’m not surprised at that, sirs :
The oaks were there before I came,
And I supplied the flat, sirs.
A man would wonder how it’s done,
The stock so soon decreases—
They sometimes tumble off the run
And break themselves to pieces.
I’ve tried to make expenses meet,
But wasted all my labours,
The sheep the dingoes didn’t eat
Were stolen by the neighbours.
They stole my pears—my native pears
Those thrice-convicted felons,
And ravished from me unawares
My crop of paddy-melons.
And sometimes under sunny skies,
Without an explanation,
The Murrumbidgee used to rise
And overflow the station.
But this was caused (as now I know)
When summer sunshine glowing
Had melted all Kiandra’s snow
And set the river going.
And in the news, perhaps, you read :
“ Stock passings. Puckawidgee,
Fat cattle : Seven hundred head
Swept down the Murrumbidgee;
Their destination’s quite obscure,
But, somehow, there’s a notion,
Unless the river falls, they’re sure
To reach the Southern Ocean. ”
So after that I’ll give it best;
No more with Fate I’ll battle.
I’ll let the river take the rest,
For those were all my cattle.
And with one comprehensive curse
I close my brief narration,
And advertise it in my verse—
For Sale ! A Mountain Station.
BANJO.


His Brother Mason’s Wife.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
it was Unquestionably Wrong of Griffiths to Covet
his neighbour’s wife —but what else was a weak,
well-fed mortal, with a Christian name other than
Joseph, to do under the circumstances ? Pretty
Mrs. Poynter had such wicked little ways with
her, ways of which her devoted husband, G. Potts
Poynter, Esq., saw nothing and suspected less.
At convenient times she would be curious to know
what book Griffiths was reading, or what photo-
graph he was admiring, and her plump figure, as
she looked demurely over that gentleman’s
shoulder, would give him many gentle palpita-
ting reminders that she was there. She had a
habit, too, of brushing against Griffiths acci-
dentally in passages, and no stairs could have
been wide enough to enable him to avoid contact
with Mrs. Poynter when they happened to meet
by the way. If he courteously kept close to the
wall, his hostess didn’t trouble to hug the ban-
nisters, and their elbows, at least, were sure to
clash. Once Mrs. Poynter declared, with a side-
glance and blush, that he had knocked her funny-
bone, but Griffiths merely smiled and passed
upstairs. To say that the lady made overtures to
her guest in these early days of our story might
be uncharitable, but to say that she sorely tempted
him to offer what Smollett and Pielding called
“gallantries,” were an assertion warranted by
the facts of the case. Yet the poor fellow tried
to remain good, although he couldn’t keep from
coveting in secret.
They were brother Masons, Ohatles Griffiths
and Potts Poynter. They belonged to the same
lodge, had sworn the same strange oaths in the
same hall, and been mystically grilled on the
same gridiron —which, as every Mason’s wife
understands, is the solemuest of all rites inci-
dental to admission into the fraternity. Now, as
a man and a brother, Griffiths was not only dis-
qualified from assailing the virtue of Mrs. Poynter,
but bound to protect her against the wiles of a
wicked world at large, and, if necessary, save her
from herself. Therefore, every time that volup-
tuous creature nudged him casually in the gloam-
ing, or sighed like a furnace at him in the pianis-
simo part of a Griffiths would bite his
lip and curse inwardly. A handsomely-framed
certificate hung over Poynter’s sideboard, and its
large, all-seeing eye (like a horse’s) seemed to be
always on Griffiths.
The Potts Poynters, four years married, were
not troubled with a family. There were no fairy
footfalls tinkling on their tufted floor, or chubby
baby fingers grabbing at dada’s tufted chin.
When Potts laid his weary head upon the pillow
at night he knew, alas ! that no sweet little cherub
would start crowing into his ear about 3 a.tn., and
sometimes he indulged in vain conjectures respect-
ing his possible feelings as a father in the event of
the missing link being “about to teeth.” The
P.P.s, however, bore up very well against having
no children, and, in point of fact, rather revelled
in the calamity. Mrs. Poynter preferred single
young people and musical evenings to dull, mar-
ried acquaintances and private baby-shows, and
shuddered at the thought of a household treasure
chipping in its soprano robusto from an adjacent
bedroom when she was singing duets with her
favourite tenor.
Griffiths was that privileged vocalist. The
oldest of the young people (say a year or two over
30) he was the most inveterate attendant at these
evenings. About three times a week, too, on an
average, he dined with the Poynters enfamille.
Potts was very much attached to his old chum
Charlie, and had a fatal weakness for bringing the
silvery tenor home with him from the city, to try
over something new with his wife. Potts himself
being nothing better than a cracked baritone
with a chronic cough, was apt to leave the tuneful
pair trilling their lays whilst he pottered round in
the garden or went and yarned with the dog.
Love, beautiful love, was the inevitable theme
of duets between Griffiths and his friend’s wife.
If they sang solos, accompanying one another
upon the piano, it was with paeans of amorous joy,
or musical sobs of such secret passion and subdued
longing, that they shook the chandelier. This
was as much owing to force of circumstances as
to their own design. All the new ballads seemed
to deal with brand new “engagements,” or
aching hearts and livers depressed by grief.
Weeks and months ran smoothly along on the
lines laid down by the fatuous Potts. Friend
Griff, was continually being thrilled by the touch
of Mrs. Poynter’s white hand as they both
turned over a leaf of music at the same time, and
his soul chafed more and more against the statute
of limitations fixed by an unfeeling craft. The
temptation to slip his arm round the lady’s waist
and press her tight against his bachelor bosom
grew stronger with each new duet. He began to
loathe the very name of Masonry, except at
lodge dinners. The sight of a Past-Grandmaster,
or any sort of high chief cockalorem, was to him
as a red rag to a raging bull. He often felt in-
clined to fall bodily on a bloated autocrat of the
order in the middle of George-street, and ask him
whether he didn’t consider one particular law of
Masonry an outrage on human nature. As for
the beautiful example of Joseph, he had long
since decided that it was sickening.
One warm summer evening the pair were
languishing together at the piano, as usual.
Rain had just been falling after a six weeks’
drought, so the confiding but inhuman Potts,
armed with a bag of salt, was making the most
of such an opportunity to go snail-hunting in the
garden. By the pale light of a lantern
he was dropping grains of destruction upon
the slimy shell-backs and slugs, and emit-
ting fiendish chuckles as they petered
out of this life in yellow-greeny bubbles.
Occasionally he varied the monotony of the
slaughter by stamping on a large, fat snail in
order that he might hear its dying crackle and
gloat over the “ horrid swish ” of its splattered
entrails The master of the house was happy
enough.
Griffiths, playing his own accompaniment on
this occasion, had just concluded a really melting
appeal to “ Her whom I love with a love like fire,
with the passionate throb of a mad desire,” or
something of that sort—we have constructed the
poetry for this occasion. The thermometer stood
at 91 in the gas, and the bright colour in Mrs.
Poynter’s cheek came and went like a revolving
light. She was so impressionable; she had no
mother; Mrs. Grundy forgot her, and she fell to
kissing Griffiths fast and furiously. Bending over
that fascinating tenor as he sat, charged with
magnetism, upon the music-stool, she took his
face between her hands, pressed it backward a
little to the left, and attacked his mouth raven-
ously.
For several seconds Griffiths was carried away
by these unhallowed endearments, and returned
kiss for kiss. Then he shook himself free, stood
«P, and, facing his assailant, gasped: “Mrs.
Poynter — Maud — you mustn’t.” The words came
from his white, trembling lips like a despairing
groan. 18
“O, what have I done?” said the lady. Her
hands were before her face, and perhaps she took
one little peep at Griffiths through her fingers,
Poynter knew quite well what she had done,
and was all too ready to repeat the dose ; yet her
enquiry was per fectly feminine and natural. It is
the privilege of women to be able to delude them-
selves into astonishment at their own behaviour,
when astonishment seems called for.
Darling, you have shown me your heart, told
ffle at laBt %* th your own H (this was Griff.’s
o i rcumsp ect manner of putting the case) what I
have dared to suspect all along. You have made
me—at least, you would have made me the hap-

She clutched the arm of her unlucky idol, and
hung her head a little. “I didn’t know—at least
I don’t quite understand—are yon angry with

A LION AND NO MISTAKE.
(Our artist tries his hand at a sassiety sketch.)
LADY PLANTAGENT PEISLY (of Onions Point) : “There —do you see that young party over
yonder talkin’ to my gals? well, that’s the lion of the day.”
DUKE DE DARLNURST: “Wot, the cove with the winder in his eye? Well, what does he
do uncommon?”
LADY P. : “Oh, he don’t do nothin’, and never did. But his step-mother was the
granda-ater of the celebrated poet Wattsisname."
DUKE DE D.: “You don’t say so! but wot did Wattisname write?
LADY P.: “Well, do you know that’s wot nobuddy seems to know, you know!”
“ Oh, Charlie, how could you come to join such
a*wretched tiling, I always hated it! ” His ex-
planation hadn’t impressed the lady as much as he
expected. She looked almost sulky as he shook
her limp hand and rushed out to bid good-bye to
Potts, who was still busy amongst the snails.
That amiable husband, after escorting Griffiths to
the gate, returned to the drawing room and found
his wife sitting at the piano, apparently deep in
reflection. “ Naughty man, we began to think
you were lost,” she exclaimed.
The visits of Griffiths to his old friends grow
less frequent for a long time after the episode re-
corded above, whilst his absence from their
periodical gatherings was regretfully noted by the
brethren. And although the pressing invitations
of Poynter at length overcame his scruples as
regards the musical evenings, and tempted him
back to the house of danger as often as of yore,
nothing could revive his interest in the Craft,-
Friend Charlie excused himself from accompany-
ing Potts to Masonic dinners on the score of indi-
gestion. He didn’t dare to say aloud that Free-
masonry was “rot,” but he thought it all the
same. His disgust for the institution was almost
as great as that of Mrs. Poynter, who plainly told
her husband that no man who loved his wife
would belong to a secret society, and besought
him to give it up at once. It flattered him to see
how the little woman’s jaw dropped when he said
that withdrawal from the sacred bonds of Masonry
was impossible. “ Begad ! she does like to have
me always at home,” thought Potts.
All men are vain. . .
Autumn was far advanced in the sere,
yellow leaf, and Mr. Poynter was down wit
influenza, when Griffiths one morning received a
letter.

fortably, as though her collar were rather tight.
“ I wish you would get me a little poison from
your place. ” she said.
Griffiths, who earned his daily bread as acting-
manager of a wholesale drug business, was
not used to supplying his lady friends with that
class of goods.
“ Poison!” His thoughts naturally turned to
Rough on Rats.
“Yes, the dog howls at night and disturbs
Pottv (her pet name for Potts). Besides, he’s
getting very old, and I’m sure he would be better
killed ” —referring, of course, to the dog. Her
husband was in the prime of life.
“ Don’t you think you had better give the brute
away?” .
“ Who’d take him ? And then it would save
trouble to have him killed. I thought a few grams
of strychnine on a piece of meat —but you know
best. Perhaps there is something not so-so
violent as strychnine ; the same sort of thing, only
a little milder.” Mrs. Poynter shifted her position
several times whilst making the suggestion.
‘ Griffiths offered feeble objections to this mode
of dealing with the dog. He referred, in harsh,
jocular tones, to the danger of having deadly
poisons about a house, and suggested that the
butcher would give any domestic animal its happy
dispatch for a shilling. The lady remained ob-
durate, however.
“How foolish you are; as if there was any
danger.” She rose from her chair and put her
hand upon his shoulder. He took a rough hold of
her wrist, and they looked straight into one
another’s eyes, enquiringly.
“ Get it for rne, Charlie.”
“ If you must have it,” he answered.
His brother Mason’s wife drew a little nearer to
Charlie, as though expecting a more affectionate
reply, but he shook his head significantly, and
Maud knew he mustn't. But a moment after-
wards when he was leaving the house she put her
hand again upon his shoulder and whispered a
few words so softly that he had to bend his head
to catch their meaning.
Then she passed along into the bedroom a-tiptoe
and sat considering her liege lord as he lay asleep
and almost dead-looking. What did he want to
be a Mason for, she wondered.
The influenza, which affects so many different
people in so many different ways, soon began
to have a terribly depressing influence on
Mr. Potts Poynter, and at about six o’clock
on a cold, grey morning that respected mer-
chant stiffened himself out for ever. The
family doctor, a very gifted old gentleman,
ever on the alert for new marvels in Nature’s
ways, considered that the case of his friend was a
noble contribution to the cause of science, and a
further proof of the faculty s ignorance concerning
the vast possibilities of this new and mysterious
disease. He certified that Potts’ death was due
to acute tetanic influenza, and introduced his
symptoms into a lecture a few days after the sad
event. As one of the late gentleman’s executors
he found a melancholy pleasure in informing
enquirers that poor P. P. had left his distressed
widow amply provided for. “How cut up she
is !” he generally added. Ardent scientist that
he was, the doctor would willingly have seen the
late lamented cut up likewise, but his relict
wouldn’t hear of such a thing, it appeared,
“ The mention of a post-mortem sent her int*
hysterics—most devoted woman you ever met,’-
said the venerable geeser.
They gave Potts Poynter a fine Masonic
funeral, and a great concourse of gentlemen in silk
aprons and other uncanny trappings gathered
round his grave. Not one of his old friends was
missing from the ceremony save Charley Griffiths,
who had started North on a month's holiday
before poor Poynter’s bad symptoms set in.
General regret was expressed at 1 lie unavoidable
absence of the dead man’s dearest friend.
Wouldn’t Charlie be cut up when he heard of it,
they said. Everybody, indeed, was cut up.
When the chief mourners returned to the house,
for a little light refreshment and a parting sigh,
they remarked that the dog in the yard was
howling most pathetically. So it would seem
that Mrs. Poynter hadn’t poisoned the faithful
animal after all. She couldn’t find the heart to
do it, perhaps.
Mrs. Poynter took a trip to Maoriland almost
immediately after the funeral, and remained away
from Sydney a full six months. She bre her
sorrow with a gentle resignation and modest
fortitude which was considered to be beyond
criticism, and the monument over her late
husband’s grave was a chaste design in the best
red granite. Griffiths waited patiently for an
intimation of her return, which arrived at last.
They met where they had parted, in the same
room which had witnessed his last triumphant
struggle against temptation. She looked so nice
in her weeds.
“ There is no barrier between us now?” asked
Mrs. Poynter.
“None, none, my darling;” said the emanci-
pated Mason.
And that night, ere turning into his bachelor
couch to dream of an impending wedding, he
humbly thanked Heaven for having given him
strength to keep the solemn law of the craft.
E.F.
Anguish of mind has driven many to
suicide, anguish of body never. This proves that
the health of the mind is of far more consequence
to our happiness than the health of the body,
although both are deserving of much more atten-
tion than either receives. In protracted cases of
disease it is the continual mental strain and worry
that enervates and finally undermines the whole
system and destroys the vital spark. How many
men apparently healthy to-day are lying in a cold
grave a week hence. They are negligent of their
health and think they can shake every attack off,
the effect of such foolishness becomes apparent to
every man sooner or later , and wise is he who never
neglects the symptoms of disease but takes pre-
cautions, as did a gentleman who writes:—“l
write to let you know that I am a patron of your
wonderful Clements Tonic; I have been a great
sufferer, and read of Mrs. Moeller's cure in the
newspapers, her case was nothing to mine, but,
thank God ! through her letter I am cured, and
after the doctors had pronounced sentence of death
on me. lam very grateful to Mrs. Moeller for her
letter. I have great pleasure in adding my
testimony to that of the many others cured of
serious diseases by the use of Clements Tonic; I
have suffered terribly from liver and kidney
disease. Two years ago my strength began rapidly
to decline, I had dull headache, completely lost
my appetite, and was almost blind—(failure of
sight is a symptom of Bright’s disease. —Ed). I
had tiger claw cramps in the calves of my legs,
and severe rheumatic pains, followed by diarrhoea,
strength continued to fail, accompanied by
extreme pallor of the face, puffed under the eyes,
and persistent swelling of legs, knees and ankles,
and my whole body was swollen to a wonderful
size ; sharp shooting pains pierced the heart and
frequently chills and fever would attack me.
The swelling was so bad that I was afraid
to even drink a glass of water. I consulted
a doctor, and he examined my water, and
he said it was a bad case of liver disease,
and also Bright’s disease of the kidneys; he
prescribed medicine and liniments with mustard
baths. I said, “ Doctor, if you will cure me, I
will PAY YOU WHAT YOU like.” He replied, 1
CAN HOLD OUT NO HOPE FOB you.” I said, “That
is very hard.” “I never like to take a mans
money,” said he, 11 without telling him the truth,
and I will come to you at any hour of the night
you may send for me. ” He thought I should soon
die. I gave his treatment a fair trial, but the
swelling of my body increased so much that I
had to" remain in bed; the pains increased and
extended all down the side, and my eyesight was
now almost completely gone. I consulted another
eminent medical man who, after sounding me and
testing my urine, said I had Bright’s disease.
I asked if he could cure me; he said he would do
his best, and if I would continue his medicine 1
should improve; I did so and it had but little
more effect than water. Two friends of mine
called my attention to Mrs. Moeller’s letter in the
paper who had been cured of the same disease by
Clements Tonic. I procured a supply, and
taking it strictly in accordance with the direc-
tions, the swellings began to go down. 1 kept up
the use of Clements Tonic, and now, thank God,
I am cured, my swellings have all subsided, my
eyesight is as good as ever* I took a good many
bottles, but that is nothing as it has cubed me,
and I cannot describe its value. .? ul ' s r , tru vv’

THE SHANTY
ON THE RISE
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
When the caravans of wool-teams climbed the
ranges from the West,
On a spur among the mountains stood a bullock-
drivers’ rest;
It was built of bark and saplings and was rather
rough inside,
But ’twas good enough for bushmen in the care.
less days that died—
'iust a quiet little shanty kept by “ Something'
in-Disguise,”
As the bushmen called the landlord of the
Shanty the Rise.
Chorus:
Just a quiet little shanty kept by Something-
in-l)isguise,
As the bushmen called the landlord of the
Shanty on the Rise—
Of the Shanty on the Rise,
Of the Shanty on the Rise ;
As the bushmen called the landlord of the
Shanty on the Rise.
City swells who “do the Royal” would have
called the shanty low,
But ’twas better far and purer than some toney
pubs. I know,
For the patrons of the Shanty had the prin-
ciples of men,
And the spieler, if he struck it, wasn’t welcome
there again ;
You could smoke and drink in quiet, yarn, or
else soliloquise
With a decent lot of fellows in the Shanty on
the Rise.
You could, &c.
’Twas the bullock-drivers’ haven when the rain
was on the road,
And the waggon-wheels were groaning as they
ploughed beneath the load ;
And I mind how weary teamsters struggled on
when it was light,
Just to camp within a cooey of the Shanty for
the night;
And I think the very bullocks raised their
heads and fixed their eyes
On the candle in the window of the Shanty on
the Rise.
And I think, &c.
And the bullock-bells were clanking from the
marshes on the flats
As we hurried to the shanty where we hung
our dripping hats,
And we took a drop of something that was
brought at our desire,
As we stood with steaming moleskins in the
' kitchen by the fire.
Oh ! it roared upon a fireplace of the good old-
fashioned size
When the rain came down the chimney of the
Shanty on the Rise.
Oh, it roared, &c.
They got up a Christmas party in the shanty
long ago,
While I camped with Jimmy Nowlett on the
river-bank below ; ,
Poor old Jim was in his glory—they d elected
him M.C., , ~
For there wasn’t such another raving lunatic
“ Mr. S Nowlett, Mr. Swaller,” shouted Some-
thing-in-Disguise, til ,
As we walked into the parlour of the Shanty on
the Rise.
Mr. Nowlett, &c.
There is little real pleasure in the city where I
There’s a “ swarry ” round the corner 'with its
mockery and sham,
But a fellow can be happy when around the
room he whirls .
In a party up the country with the jolly country
Wh/, at times I almost fancied I was dancing
on the skies m
When I danced with Mary Carey in the Shanty
on the Rise.
Oh, at times, &c.
Jimmy came to me and whispered, and I
muttered, “ Go along !
But he shouted, “ Mr. Swaller will oblige us
with a song.” , T , j
And at first I said I wouldn’t, and I shammed a
little, too,
Till the girls began to whisper, “ Mr. Swallow,
■ now, ah do! ”
So I sang a song of something ’bout the love
that never dies,
And the chorus shook the rafters of the Shanty
on the Rise.
So I sang, &c.
Jimmy burst his concertina, and the bullock-
drivers went
For the corpse of “ Joe the Fiddler,” who was
sleeping in his tent;
Joe was tired and had lumbago, and he wouldn’t
come, he said,
But the case was very urgent so they pulled
him out of bed,,
And they fetched him, for the bushmen knew
that Something-in-Disguise
Had a cure for Joe’s lumbago, in the Shanty on
the Rise.
And they fetched him, &c.
Jim and I were rather quiet while escorting
Mary home,
’Neath the stars that hung in clusters, near and
distant, from the dome,
And we walked so very silent—being lost in
reverie—
That we heard the “ settlers’-matches* ” gently
rustle on the tree,
And I wondered who would win her when she
said her sweet good-byes,
But she died at one-and-twenty and was buried
on the Rise.
And I wondered, &c.
I suppose the shanty vanished from the ranges
long ago,
And the girls are mostly married to the chaps
I used to know,
My old chums are in the distance, some have
crossed the Border-line,
But in fancy still their glasses chink against
the rim of mine,
And, upon the very centre of the greenest spot
that lies
In my fondest recollection —stands the Shanty
on the Rise.
And upon the very centre, &c.

The sick man turned writhingly upon his hard

body and the bed-frame, for the mattrass had been

his children for three days; and the withering
flesh was not so benumbed as yet by the pressed
fingers of approaching death that the roughness
and rigidity of the iron failed to inflict pain.
“Bob!” he quavered again when he faced the
door instead of the wall. “Yes I will write

the thousand and one uselessnesses which had
once been necessaries to him—and tapped on the

“ Ain’t .”

Dear Robert,—The address is conventional and means
nothing, and, therefore, I use it. I don’t say “ Bob,” for
that would mean something. It would mean, would it
not, that there was a savour of the old days, our very
earliest days, when we cared tor one another, in my
nostrils ? And there is not, Robert—not the faintest!
As ever since elder boyhood, I hate you, and as you were
never the one to change, lam sure you hate me. If I,
who was always so variable, could be constant to that one
passion of hate, it is certain you hate me no less.
Then, still hating you, why should I write to you ? Not
for myself, you may be sure ! If you can answer this at
once, your reply will be delivered by Wednesday. This
is Monday-and by Thursday or Friday I shall be over
the Boundary. So, this is not for myself. It is for the
children ! And it is not for my share of the children, but
for her's. There are two of them, and I pray you to
recollect that they are her's as well asinine. A boy,
twelve, and a girl, nine-the boy with some rags upon
him, the girl with scarcely any; neither has had a full
meal for a month. I write for them, Bob.
There! the old boyhood’s name has slipped off the
nib. I did not know it, believe me, till it was done. I
got weak for the moment, thinking of the children there
must be some link between the present and the tender-
ness of that earliest time-and it went down. I will let
it stand. . ,
At the lowest ebb of the tide I write this—and there
will be no spring to the tide this time. I shall have ten
shillings—perhaps twelve-and-six —to-day from a certain
source. Eight of that sum will go for arrears of rent
and on the balance, whether it be two shillings or four-
and-six, the children and myself have to live till all is
over. When I’m beyond the Line— do you remember
how, on the home station, the old assigned cook used to
talk of dying as crossing the Boundary ? and we lads
didn’t understand him then ; we thought he mea "
going beyond the settled districts?— parenthetical, as
usual, every editor I have scribbled for says I am oo
parenthetical, and why shouldn’t I be?—l am only a
parenthesis myself slung without apparent motive into
the page of the world’s life, and the style is of the man,
you know —but the long and short of it is that I won t
leave enough to buy a clean sheet to be buried in. Not
that it matters to me, but the poor children ! Her s as
well as mine—don’t forget that.
Brothers that we are, love never, since the first years,
was lost between us. You thought when we came from
school I was favoured in everything—l was given every-
thing you coveted—and you had nothing, you said, but
what vou were pleased to term my leavings. You were
always vulgar, Robert. If you help my children 1
mean her’s—keep them free from that taint, I pray you.
Yes we hated one another ; I you from superciliousness
and pride because I was the favoured one; you me,
from envv. You always were a mean, jealous
cur, Robert. That is the reason you have been
successful, doubtless. It is so easy to be suc-
cessful when one runs away from the conscience ot a
gentleman. Even when I won her from you, your jealousy
generated a sharper malignity because with her I got
Karanuk out-station. I could appreciate a wholesome
hatred bee -use I won the woman upon whom you had set
your hopes, but a love if the woman complicated with
creek-frontages and lightly-timbered country I could not
and cannot understand.
However, that is all gone now—the money, and the
station and the love. Only the hatred remains— and the
children. T ,
Perhaps lam a fool to write this way ; perhaps not. n
you are disposed to help the children you will do so in
spite of this last bubbling forth of my contempt. And it
you will not help them, then, if beyond the Boundary
they know anything at all, I shall sunly be glad I did not
abandon that hate at the ebbing of the tide which I had
nourished at the flood.
. Do you see this stain ? The bleeding came
on a<rain while I was sitting up to write, and the stigma
of the “ensanguined drops” will give you pleasure
surely, O, my brother? They would to me, I declare to
you if our positions were reversed. They are so eloquent
of what even you, dear sir, with your M.L.C.-ship, and
your stations, and your dummied selections—perjury
must have be n congenial to you, good brother Robert—
and your flocks and your herds, will have to do; you,
even you, will have to pass the Boundary !
And the boy—he's come back and siys he received
but nine shillings for the cane. The Jew, because the ad
had defaced the engraving of the name, gave him that,
and no more. He has paid the rent and brought back
lid and a penny stamp. Really, how grateful lam to
Parliament for enacting penny postage ! Now, had it
been twopence still, the youngsters would have been sboi t
one pennyworth of milk-a full ratal for them, Omv
brother, according to our present dietary scale. Oh and
bv the w'ay, you voted against that reduction. Had jou
some premonition of how great a blow you could inflict
unon me could you involve me in double expense for
postage in mine extremity ? No, of course not; to sup-
pose that would be to pre-
sume you had occasionally
some swift vision into things
unconnected with barbed-
wire and the price of
shearers’ rations ; which, ns
old Euclid hath it, would be
absurd.
Yes, lid. And do you
know what that lid. repre-
sints? Fathei’s gold-headed
cane ! From the earliest boy-
hood when you rode it strad-
dle-legged—l laugh now, as
heartily as my lung will
allow me, to recall how even
your infantile steed used to
trip you up, and so forecast
the miserable horsemanship
of your latter years —Heaven!
the newest jackeroo on your
run ridicules you when you
mount your horse—what am
I writing?—when you are
assisted to mount your horse
I should say—l say from boy-
hood you craved to own that
cane. And now I have sold
it-to a Jew, Robert, a Jew 1

street. Perhaps you would
like to buy it after all? He
will not charge you surely
more than 200 per cent.
profit. I hope he won’t
charge you less! I shall
grieve Beyond the Line if he
does,for I should liketoknow
that you had to pay 27s. —27
drops of your heart’s blood—
for what you always thought
should have been yours by
right. Still, even if you pay
275. for it, the gold will be
cheap at that. For you, of
course, will value it only for
the gold—you couldn’t enter
into the sense of that subtle
companionship which links
a man to a cane his dead
friend or foe has carried—at
least a guinea and a half.
Think of it, O my brother !
You might make 4s. fid. upon
an expenditure of 275. Look
at the gain !
So—my strength will not
suffice to write another five
lines even if I had paper—l
close. Dear Robert, believe
that in death as in life I am

to strike out “ Bob.” And I
do it. Still—remember the

“Agentleman! Surely
not! Oli, it is you,

uncle!”
“ Boy, here are two sovereigns. Go and buy
back the cane you sold two days ago !”
“ Ah—Robert - you do value it, then ? I thought
I could not err in my judgment. But are you
not indiscreet in giving so loose a commission?
He might give more than the twenty-seven
shillings!” .
“ Never mind that. I could not spare the time
to go for it myself. I came here as speedily as I
could—and you’re obviously too near the
Boundary, as you say, for me to leave you now. 1 '
“ Robert—you’re positively kind ! And you’re
come to do something for the children ? ’
“ Before I answer that let me remind you that
once I swore I would have that cane before you
died, and that I would flog you with it Do you
remember ?”
“ Surely, 0 my brother, yes !”
“I am glad of it. Now I will answer you. I
shall do nothing for your children !”
“ Then—why, if it is not impertinent, did yens
come here?”
“ I cannot flog you with that cane now. But I
can spurn you with it when you are carrion. I
came for that—and to see you die!”
PRICE WARUNG.


THE STOLEN SHEEP
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Say, mate, it’s a tidy long stretch since we
parted near old Lambin’ Flat;
Twenty years? - Yes, I reckon it is, and a
sprinklin’ of odd ’uns on that.
Let’s see—after you with the light—l’ve a fancy
’twas sometime about
A day or so after the time old Tommy the
butcher pegged out.
What ! don’t you remember old Tommy? Why
all on the diggin’s knew him—
Had a butchery down the main Creek, pretty
nigh to the Company’s whim ;
A small, wizened runt of a man like a shrivelled-
up scrap of green-hide—
I thought you would call him to mind—did they
ever find out how he died ?
No ? never got trace of his carcase from that day
to this. Umph—that’s queer,
But I fancy there’s one man about who could
soon make the mystery clear.
Foul play ?—h’m—well no, not exactly, that is
if it’s murder you mean ;
But as cheesey a case for a cor’ner as ever Ned
Tucker has seen.
P’rhaps now you would-
n’t believe that I
helped to put
Tommy away,
Oh, you needn’t be
starin’ like that
though you feel a
bit shocked, I dare
say.
But listen: It’s safe
now, I reckon, to
let the cat out of the
bag, £)
And I know you of yore
pretty well as a
fellow not given to
mag.
Well, you see ’twas on
old Possum Flat we
were workin’, Jim
Clinton and I
Both lime-burners right
from the start, so,
of course, it was
Root, hog —or die ;
But after a-bottomin’
duffers for five or
six weeks at a spell
We were not only down
at the mouth but
were down at the
heel, mate, as well.
Notascrap in the tucker-
bag left, and not
even the price of a
feed,
With our credit all stop-
ped at the stores
and no friend to be
found in our need,
And the hunger a-gnaw-
in’ our in’ards and
givin’ us rats all the day,
Though we pulled in our belts a bit tighter
a-thinkin’ to ease it that way.
So at last we got puzzlin’ our wits ’bout makin’
a rise in the dark ;
And of all other men we considered old
Tommy our easiest mark.
We didn’t half relish the notion, and there was,
you may safely depend,
A fight betwixt hunger and conscience, but
conscience gave up in the end.
So we laid both our noddles together and faked
up a dodge pretty slick
To wait on the butcher that evenin’ with an
order for mutton—on tick—
That’s to put a good face on it, matey. How*
somever, one part of our plan
Was to borrow a small-wheeled toboggan from
a cove that they called Curly Dan.
You recollect Dan, I suppose?—a short, stiff-
built style of a chap,
Who used to hawk cow-heel and tripe in a
queer little box of a trap.
Well, the dead of the night found us there with
the barrow all ready at hand.
And our hearts goin’ thumpity-thump, that
shaky we scarcely could stand.
y,r ° hadn’t much trouble in forcin’ and enterin’
into his den—
As you know, they weren’t ovcr-perticler about
their door-fastenin’s then—
So in I goes, clawin’ and gropin’, whilst Clinton
kept watch in the street,
And it seemed that each carcase and quarter
was wrapped in a calico sheet.
I didn’t stand pickin’ and choosin’ to get at the
best in the stall,
But made a wild grab for the nearest and
lugged it away, hook and all,
And staggerin’, half-starved as I was, with the
slippery load on my back,
I slung it down flop in the cart and we trundled
away down the track.
It was not till we reached the old tent that
we ventured to peep at our prize—
Y <dl, I ve seen some queer things in my travels,
but never a worse met my eyes.
Ugh ! it makes me feel all of a creep when I
think of the horrible sight.
‘ Jumpin’ Joss!” says I, “what have we here?’’
when a puff o’ wind blows out the light.
And there I stands shakin’ and quakin’, whilst
Jim was knocked all of a heap,
For the thing that we saw in the barrow was
not in the form of a sheep.
No ; but there in a greasy old night-shirt that
covered him down to his toes,
With a rope round his thin, stringy neck, and
all blue at the gills and the nose,
And his eyes like the eyes of a grasshopper, a*
startin’ right out of his head.
Lay the scraggy old scrubber himself, lad,
Wee Tommy, the butcher, stark dead.
There was nothin’ else for it, of course, but to
plant his old carcase and slide,
But as neither of us had the stummick to handle
his cold, clammy hide
We backed the cart up to a shaft, and just
tilted him in neck-and-crop
And never cried crack till we’d shovelled a
cartload of mullock on top.
Then we run the truck into the scrub, packed
our blueys and went on a tower,
“ Jumpin' Joss!" says I, “what have we here?”
And paid all onr debts wid the storekeeps at
the rate of about five mile an hour ;
But the devil knows how we’d have fared if we
hadn't met you on the way
And—well that was the end of old Tommy;
so here’s to his ashes I say !

Some traveller reports that in some place
or other in Central Africa the legal tender consists
of old brass kettles melted down, and the local
half-crown weighs 4 lbs. Any Treasurer who
wants to put the finances on a solid basis might
have a look at this scheme. When a man is liable
to be killed by being hit on the stomach with two-
and-six the solidity of things is self-apparent.
Also, as a means for preventing the undue
accumulation of wealth, the currency in question
seems to have its advantages ; it would be a
restraint on the flying bank-clerk; for nobody
could lose his money in the street because he
would always feel so much lighter when he dropped
a coin, that he couldn’t help knowing it was gone.

I.— Concerning a Prisoner at the Bar.
There are two persons in New South WaLs, only
two of us, who know why there was not a broken
neck among the broken hearts in a fashionable
square of a large city, in Scotland some thirty or
forty years ago. The neck was not broken, but
would have been stretched, if a girl and I had
told all we knew. We were never asked, because
no one knew that we were in any way aware of
what took place in connection with a poisoning-
case that caused a great sensation. Not proven,
gentlemen; not proven, ladies ; not proven, all ye
common men; not proven, servant-maids and
factory-girls, who are spending your pennies on
Latest Editions; not proven, but very near it.
So we’ll let that flea stick to the wa’. And I'll
tell you how we met again and again and ye
again.
11.— Concerning a Lady at the Bar.
There were four of us in one claim on the
Cudgegong River diggings. We were a good lot,
that is, we didn’t quarrel, hardly ever argued, and
did not drink more than we could carry. It was
Friday night, and I was alone in the hut. My
mates had gone down the street, one to fetch a
sluicing-fork and two, each to carry a bag of chaff
for one old horse. I could hear them returning
and arguing earnestly and loudly, but apparently
about a trivial matter-the colour of something—
and old Throok. shouted, “We’ll leave it to Ralph
and he will decide. I pay for champagne if he
gives it red." Then they entered the hut and placed
a bottle of square-gin on the table. After a nip, I
said : “ Well, mates, what is the point at issue?”
“Just this,” said Dugald Little, “there’s a new
girl, or woman, at Driscoll’s, and I say her hair is
red, so does Spruhan, but Throck. says there is
not even a shade of auburn, and we want you,
to-morrow night, mind you, by lamp-light, to
state your opinion of her wig. But, by Jove, it’s
no false hair; it is the most beautiful I have ever
seen, red though it be.” Then I thought of the
old-gold hair of a head in Scotland, and of our
quarrel and parting on the night that the Jersey-
man drank coffee and arsenic, and, promising to
well and truly try the ease, I took a pull at the
square bottle, and slept the sleep of a ground-
si nicer.
Saturday. Knock off early; wash ; clean
clothes on—not flash ones—only clean moles and
Crimean shirt, Yankee hat and red sash ; boots
greased—not blackened—and down we go to
Driscoll’s. 8
Have you ever, at night, been dazed by a flash
of lightning? You can almost feel the blast. If
walking, it makes you
stop and raise your hand
in front of your eyes.
If standing, it makes you
start and wink. That
was my feeling on enter-
ing the bar, for there
stood my lady, once my
lady-love, and what she
was doing behind a bar
in a shanty on the dig-
gings was, and is, to me
a mystery. She knew
me and put one finger
on her lips before any-
one could see our mutual
recognition, and shook
hands when the introduc-
tion, “Miss Knox, Mr.
Leishman,” took place.
The fun on that Satur-
day night was fast and
furious. The new bar-
maid was drawing cus-
tom : some noisy men
had christened her “ the
Ked Flag ”; some quieter
ones had come to the
conclusion that this was
no ordinary drawer of
beer and brandy, and the
entry of our party caused
a “universal shout”
(Shakespeare). Then
Throck. spoke out thus :
“Miss Knox, we are
only diggers, all of us
men, some of us, I hope,
gentlemen. You must
excuse us for having
made a bet concerning
your personal appear-
ance. You must excuse
us if we even give
you a nick-name. Some
of us have ventured to
call you the ‘ Red Flag.’
I wish you were our ban-
ner of that colour. You’ll
know by and bye what
it means; but here we
have our quiet man, Mr.
Ralph Leishman, and he
is to decide what the
colour of your hair is, and
on that your cognomen
. will greatly 3epehd.
Ralph will name its colour and I shall name you
You are not angry ?” J
Then Miss Knox quietly said : “ Ralph, what is
the colour of my hair ? ”
, Old gold and Little and Spruhan ordered
the champagne.
Whilst it was being opened, Throck. disappeared
—soon to return with a bunch of pale-red ribbons
and a silver-arrow attached to a sort of hair-pin
Ihis he persuaded Miss Knox to allow him to
fasten in her hair (I admit the shocking taste
of the contrast), and calling up all the company
he proclaimed that he hereby hoisted the Red Flag
on Payable Gold ; and thereafter no one knew her
by any other name on the Cudgegong diggings.
And next week we struck it, to the tune of four
figures a man; like men we went home, Throck. to
Little and I to Scotland, and Spruhan
to But on that Saturday night as I
bought the inevitable key-brand-square, Miss
Knox slipped a note into my hand which I read
when I got a chance alone. This was it :
Ralph,—As a man you will not seek to renew our
acquaintance. As a gentleman you will make no inquiries
here or at linns concerning, Yours not as formerly
So I dined with her father and mother at acountry
place in Scotland, but never a word said they to
me of Pat. 1 fancy the old gentleman listened
with more than ordinary attention to my digging-
yarns, but he made no sign. b
lll.—Concerning a Lady at the German Bar.
Flood-time on the Palmer, Famine on one
side, plenty on the other. In one shanty, abeauti
ful female, laughing at the horseflesh and native
cabbage, and Jots of men round her proposing means
of communication, means which none had the
pluck to try. Then Mrs. Knox—just Mrs. from the
familiarity that raises your landlady to married
rank—looking askance, says quickly: “There
is one man among you who will swim if I ask
him.” Sol must needs answer: “There is one
man who will swim if you do not ask him.” Then
we go up the river, about a hundred yards above
where the packers are camped on the opposite
side. A stout fishing-line is made fast round my
chest and a knife tied to it in case of entangle-
ment. I dive in. It is the easiest way to start
The line is carefully paid out, so as not to sag and
belly too much in the current, and I arrive among
the packers, noting that Patricia has been watch-
ing me ere I go into a tent to dress. There is
soon a rope across and easy communication. That
night I was regaled on Queensland rum by every
man-Jack (why Jack ?) at the German Bar, and
still Miss Knox knew me not apparently.
From rush to rush, from the Palmer to the
Hodgkinson and to whatever shanties existed
went Payable Gold and her red flag.
One day I met her in Brisbane, shook hands and
asked her “ Where away ? ” One word for answer
“Silverton.” Then to continue: “Are you
making money ? ” There was a slight pause, and
slow the reply came: “I have made money
Good morning.” Then Pat. came to the great
rush at Painted Rocks, which brings me to our last
meeting.
IV.—Concerning the Raising op the Bar.
I had given up mining, broke, gone, stiff as a
crutch, to use the slang of to-day. I was, in fact
boundary-rider on a station and had taken the
horse Auricomus to show for my boss at the
Merriwarrie Agricultural, &c. The chestnut was
entered as a hack and as a lady’s hunter. There
was great jealousy between my employer, Tom
Creagh, and another squatter, a Mr. Flux. Some
hundreds were bet as to which would win, Auri-
comus or Medium, Men will bet about anything;
the prize was only a bit of ribbon and a couple of
sovereigns. Young Flux had got Mrs, Nectar
the crack horsewoman, to ride his nag and Mr!
Creagh had the promise of Miss Tigerly to show off
Aury, ” But this young lady was stricken by the
particular form of typhoid for which Merriwarrie
has obtained a just celebrity, and we (Tom, I, and
Auricomus) were on our beam-ends. No duffer
would do for our mount. He was not rusty or
nasty, but terribly flash, and that made the boss
and me drink gin and beer and rum and others of
that ilk, until Tom had reached the crying stage
of ebriety, But wine, though a mocker, is an
inspiration in many cases. The name Auricomus,
the colour of the horse, and the square-key-brand
brought Patricia into my head. Now if any woman
can ride, she can. Painted Rocks are only twenty
miles from Merriwarrie. Mr. Creagh’s horses are
fast, and fast enough for me at 7 a.rn., in front of
the Red Flag Hotel at the Rocks. “ A word with
you, Mrs. Knox, in private ?”
In the bar-parlour, Patricia took the initiative.
‘No love now, Ralph; no nonsense. Business if
you will, and not too much of that.”
Well, here was a fix. I wanted to work on the
old flame, although it was extinct, and I was de-
termined to carry my point. Therefore, I did a
mean thing : I worked on her gratitude ; in fact,
demanded a quid pro quo for my silence during
these long years, and this was the outcome of my
meanness :
“ Patricia,! have kept your secret; have never
made enquiries as to the why and the wherefore of
your disguise and elopement, and in return I beg
you to give me this day. Hear me out. These
ponies at the door belong to a man who is my
master and my friend. He has a horse at Merri-
warrie to be ridden, just for ten minutes, by a
lady. His promised rider, you know, Miss
Tigerly; she is down with fever, and the horse
Auricomus—called by me after your golden hair—
wants a thorough rider—no duffer—and, above
all, one with hands and a figure. Will you come
with me in the buggy ? We can drive over in two
hours, arriving about 10 or 12. You can buy a
tall hat and gossamer veil; no one need know
you. At two o’clock you can drop as from the
clouds, an angel in a habit and bell-topper, and
you can win this prize for my boss, who has been
so good to me. Will you ? I will never ask you
for any other favour, although I will do for you
as much as I would have done years ago. Answer
me.”
There was no hesitation. “ Get breakfast; wait
for me after in the buggy.”
We never spoke during that two hours’ drive.
In Merriwarrie, Flux was jubilant, chaffing Tom
Creagh. The latter was satisfied that I had not
taken the buggy for nothing. When we drove up
to Bellarbo’s Hotel he stood on the steps; he was
sober, and winked—not at Pat., but me. Then,
turning to Flux, he said : “Double all my bets.”
“Done.” Again—“ Any more money to lose,
Flux, old fellow?” But Flux said, “Not a
stiver.”
Two p.m. The horses are paraded. At a glance
there were none in it but Medium and Auricomus,
the latter for choice, as soon as the public saw the
splendid figure, riding and coolness of Mrs. Knox.
Funny that no one recognised her. Hundreds
had seen her at the Painted Rocks; many only
the day before. But the judges soon decided
Auncomus, 1; Medium, highly commended. Now
the jumping-bar was near the gate, and between
it and the regular exit a crowd of yahoos were
fiddling with its fixtures. They had raised it to
about five-feet-six. The riding-track was clear
but for the bar when “ Whoop! look out, she’s
coming again; ” and down the tan came Aury and
Pat., not a runaway, but just at a hand-gallop;
what the niggers call 12 annas to the rupee, the
latter being full speed. Over they go; out at the
gate, and when I walked up to Beflarbo’s, Payable
Gold had gone off in the coach for Painted Rocks.
Ladies and gentlemen, females and persons,
harridans and cads, that is all I promised to tell
you. But, _ like Bobby Salmon, the ginger-bread
man of Kircaldy, I’ll give you another short
chapter gratis, for luck.
V.— Concerning Mt Bar.
As I live, I know not why Patricia left her
home. Her friends thought it was to follow me,
but my appearance, after my rise, at the Cudge-
gong dispelled that idea. However, the Red
Flag is now kept by Mr. and Mrs. Ralph Leish-
man, where the best, &c., &c.
And in the Red Flag is my claim, my claimant,
my wife, my life, unalloyed, pure and precious,
Payable Gold.
SCOTTY THE WRINKLER.


The Row in our Boarding-
House.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The trouble began on the night when a
newly-imported British youth named Johnson
appeared at our boarding-house.
There were ten of us there before his arrival,
including Bern, the humorous Polish tailor, w’ o
was vaguely understood to have thrown bombs at
all the royal families of Europe, and then gone
into exile. We paid seventeen shillings a week
each, not including washing; and we lived
riotously on boiled mutton. There were more
empty beer - bottles in the bedrooms, and
more laughter, and more grease slopped on
the floor, and the candle-ends got into the
soup oftener in that boarding-house than in
any other I ever heard of. Also, the neighbours
got less sleep than anybody ever did in the
vicinity of any other boarding-house. The dining-
room had not been papered since the beginning of
history, and the landlady had only one eye ; also,
her daughter had recently eloped with a non-
union printer. She, the landlady, was aged about
40, and wore a green dress, and in the evenings
she used to sing songs to us with her hair down.
These few details will convey a reasonably good
idea of the nature of that wild Bohemian estab-
lishment.
One windy evening, in March, the landlady had
agitated the bell on the stairs, as was her custom.
Her weapon was a sort of cowbell, and when she
wrestled with it on the murky staircase she
looked like a witch dancing on a heath. Her
arms, her hair, her feet, her green dress, and her
trodden-down shoes flew in eight different direc-
tions, and her one eye and the bell flew in two
more. Strangers coming down in the dark, and
meeting this apparition suddenly, generally took
her for a heap of excited boa-constrictor, or an
immense octopus leaping on the top step. Poor,
old, agitated female—she is dead now. She
broke her neck in the passage one day rushing
down to look at a funeral. But if she had kept
on ringing that dinner-bell she would have been
immortal. Death couldn’t have aimed straight
enough to hit her in her gambols.
I rushed down to the dining-room at the first
signal, and meeting Bern and two more coming
tumultuously in the opposite direction, we got
jammed in the doorway. I was just going to pass
some uncomplimentary observations when we all
caught sight of a spectacle such as the oldest in-
dividual in that boarding-house had never
seen before. A great calm descended upon us,
and we disentangled ourselves and went in
silently.-
What I saw was an object like a naked infant’s
hind-leg, resting in a careless, graceful attitude
against a chair. There was a bracelet on it, and
attached to one end of it was a woman. She was
attired in a silk dress which exposed her right
down to the fifth knob of her spine, or there-
abouts, and she had a necklace, and an eye-glass,
and sundry rings. There was a frozen expression
in her eye—a look of cold derision that seemed to
fall like a curse upon the whole company. This
was Johnson’s wife. Johnson himself was there in
a tail-coat, and a tremendous collar, and another
eye-glass, and he had a silver bangle on his wrist.
He was the first male human being that I ever
saw inside a bangle, and I am prepared to swear
that he was the very first who ever wore a bangle
in a boarding-house.
Between them they made just one remark all
dinner-time. It was “ Haw ! ” I could have said
the same thing myself if I had been dead.
We did not eat much that evening, and there
was very little conversation. We were all para-
lysed by the spectacle of Johnson and his wife.
They kept looking in a pensive, perplexed sort of
way round the table as if they were searching for
some of the commonest necessaries of life, such as
were to be found in stacks in their ancestral castle;
and then they would wake up as if from a dream,
and recollect suddenly that they were castaways
in a savage land, where the wild aborigines never
heard of the article, whatever it might be. And
when they were finished the lady went and smote
the piano with an arm of might for about 38
minutes, after which the pair retired and were
seen no more that night.
That was the beginning of the row in our
boarding-house.
# * *
Next morning the owner of the establish-
ment came down early, and refreshed herself with
a few melodies before breakfast. She was a
strange, promiscuous, half-savage female, and was
wont at times to get up before daybreak, and thud
out all manner of lost chords on the keyboard,
and then she would keep time with her slippers,
and her head, and whirl her tangled locks in the
air, and cast the tails of her dressing gown out
behind her in a frenzy of inspiration. After that
she would scuttle away with a prodigious clatter,
and clutch the sausages that were to be fried for
breakfast, and for about half-an-hour the air
would be darkened with a chaos of food and
dishes, and it would blow a gale of gravy, cruets,
loaves, and similar properties. When she entered
with the breakfast-tray it always made me think
of Napoleon’s commissariat department flying
from Moscow, for she generally arrived at a
gallop, shoving one-half the provisions in front of
her and dragging the other half behind, and his-
sing to scare off the cat, which ran with its tail
up in the rear of the procession, trying vainly to
claw at the alleged eatables.
Then she would fling herself on the bell like a
hash-house keeper possessed, and make a riot that
was calculated to wake the lost souls of all the
dead boarders who had shaken off this mortal coil,
and were eating spectral ham and eggs in the
fields of Asphodel. On this morning I found her
leaping and gambolling on the stairs as usual, and
I stopped to propound a solemn question,
“Mrs. Jones,” I said sternly, “who are the
partially dressed intruder in the bed-furniture,
and the tailor’s advertisement with the jewellery
on his fore-leg ?”
“ He’s in the gas-office,” she replied in gasps, as
she threw herself up against the air with the bell.
“ Newly-married ! He’s English, and got £BO a
year! I took them in at a reduced rate. ”
“Oh, you did ! Now, look here; have you any
reason to suppose he’s a duke or an emperor, or
anything of the sort ?”
“No !”
“Do you suppose, as a respectable Christian
woman, that he’s got a castle anywhere ?”
“ No, I don’t s’pose he has.”
“Did he come in with the Conqueror, now ?”
“ There wasn’t anybody with him when he came
in, that I saw.”
“And did you know when you took them in
that she was going to stick so far out of her
clothes ?”
“ No, I didn’t. If I'd knowed it I’d have
thrown her out.”
I went into breakfast in a subdued mood.
Johnson was there looking with a shocked ex-
pression at the sausages, and shuddering in a new
bangle and a collar that was six sizes taller than
the previous one. His wife, with a fresh bracelet,
was glaring at the same viand, and the expression
in her eye seemed to say “ Where am I; is this a
horrid dream ?” It was the only morning, too, in
six months when the sausages hadn’t either fallen
under the grate or been dropped on the stairs,
and this made their conduct all the more uncalled-
for.
At lunch time Johnson’s wife appeared in
another fresh bracelet, and with a profusion of
jewellery on her right forefinger. And as for
Johnson, astounding as it may seem, he had a
third bangle on. Evidently he had one for each
meal, and this was his lunch-bangle.
In the evening the lady had another silk dress
on, and it exposed one knob more of her spine
than the previous one. Johnson wore his second
clean collar and his dinner-bangle, and his small
countenance, looming over his great expanse of
shirt-front, looked like a pallid bird of prey on the
top of an icy mountain. They talked together
in scraps of inferior French, and when the meal
was over Mrs. Johnson again smote the piano, and
then retired coldly to her own apartments.
That night we held an indignation meeting on
the balcony. The landlady had deposited the
vegetable-dish out therethrough the window when
she was getting ready to make her turbulent entry
with the pudding, and had forgotten it. Inside
there were two candles burning, and one lamp
with a broken shade—the gas had been cut off for
non-payment. The bread was in a plate on top of
the piano, and the dishes were in an unwashed
condition downstairs, and the mistress of the
house was singing a shrill melody in the kitchen.
And among these surroundings Bern, the Polish
“ He entered at that moment .”
tailor, passed a resolution that he would drive
Johnson off the premises, or die in the attempt.
After that our souls felt relieved, and we settled
down to placid harmony. Somebody found some
liquor in a bottle under his bed and brought it
down. The cards were fished out, and we played
nap, and gave each other 1.0.U.’s on a lavish
scale. The lamp flickered and went out with an
awful smell. Then one of the candles died amid
a tremendous blob of grease, and we gave up
playing, and smoked in the semi-darkness. The
bread cast a long, gaunt shadow on top of the
piano, and the vegetable-dish was forgotten on the
balcony. And finally, our landlady burst in with
the green dress partially open at the back, and
wearing a hat decorated with six broken feathers ;
and fell over the cat in the doorway; and she
played some tune that was all discords, on the
piano, while Bern sang a dirge about some for-
gotten period when he lived beside a river, and
went out musing with a female by moonlight. He
was so moved by the recollection that he wept into
the last candle, and it went out also, leaving us in
darkness.
# * *
I woke on that third morning with a
vague, indefinable feeling that somebody had died
in the night. There was a Sabbath calm brooding
over Jones’s boarding-house which was quite
foreign to that clamorous establishment, and as I
listened it suddenly occurred to me that Bern
must have carried out his threat, and dynamited
Johnson in the darkness. All the doors seemed
to close softly, instead of shutting with a soul-
destroying bang as usual. The landlady flopped
about gently on her trodden-down shoes, instead
of bringing in the breakfast with a crash and a
shriek, and shedding dishes about in all direc-
tions ; and she rang the bell gently, whereas she
usually rang it like a dray-load of escaped lunatics.
I descended the stairs amid a prevailing smell of
ham and eggs, and went into the dining-room.
Johnson was breakfasting with a troubled ex-
pression and a bangle, and his wife was glaring
across the table. Opposite them Bern was solemnly
feeding in evening dress. He looked absolutely
vacant, and seemed to be lost in profound thought,
and the frantic excitement of the other eight
boarders made no impression on him at all. He
wore a pair of kid gloves and a bracelet, and his
moustache was elegantly waxed. Johnson rose at
last, and walked round this apparition, but the
apparition never moved. Finally the Pole got up,
and thoughtfully fished an ancient, battered straw
hat from under his chair, and having jammed it
hard down on his head, he went out of the room
and out of the house like a man who was lost in
profound vacancy.
Nobody spoke. A species of paralysis seemed
to have descended on that boarding-house. But,
after a moment, Johnson rushed on to the balcony
and glared in a cataleptic fashion after this un-
accountable visitant. And outside, on the stairs,
stood a petrified landlady in a smudged green
dress, and with a hat with six broken feathers in
it, cocked rakishly over one eye, and two misfit
shoes that seemed to have taken root in the floor.
She held a teapot in one hand and a pie in the
other, and she was unconsciously pouring the tea
into the pie, and the pie on to the staircase.
» # #
Bern turned up in evening costume again
at lunch-time, but, though expectation rose to
fever-heat, nothing happened. Owing to mental
strain, however, the landlady fainted in the sink
in the course of the afternoon.
At dinner, the Johnsons began to show signs of
wear and tear. Mrs. Johnson’s left eyebrow was
out of line, and her complexion had shifted round
to her ear. Evidently it had been put on with a
reckless hand, while the wearer was under the
influence of considerable excitement. Her husband
had an enraged and harassed look, and his hair
was off the straight, and his tie was crumpled.
The landlady’s shoes were in the hall, from which i
gathered that shehadlost them in her agitation, and
her hat was under the table. As for that joyous
Bohemian herself, she was dodging round in a
semi-hysterical condition, and when I entered
she had just given Johnson the whole dish of
potatoes, and had shoved the entire joint on
another boarder’s plate, after which she deposited
the kettle in an abstracted manner on the table-
cloth. Then she fled unaccountably round the
table and supplied us all with a number of other
remarkable things too numerous and too badly
assorted to mention. There was a dead and awful
silence in the company—a silence that was too
awful to be accounted for on the supposition that
Bern had appeared again in evening-dress and
caused a panic. For one awful moment the.
thought occurred to me that the insane Pole
might possibly have appeared clothed in a marked
scarcity of dress of any kind
He entered at that moment, carefully removing a
shiny bell-topper as he came in, and depositing a
pair of gloves in its inmost recesses. He was
attired in grey pants and a linen jacket, but
he had taken the sleeves out of the jacket and
out of his shirt, and he was “ cut low ” at the
neck. Also he wore a gold bracelet—in fact, he
was a remarkably good copy of Johnson’s wife.
The landlady uttered a shriek when she saw him,
and disappeared down the stairs. The cat escaped
up the chimney, scattering last night’s dead ashes
out of the grate as it went. The other boarders
choked with insane glee, but Bern only contem-
plated them for an instant with a lack-lustre eye
and a funereal visage, and sat down. He was the
one unmoved individual in the company.
Then Johnson arose, and shaking a fork in the
air with a palsied hand, he made a brief oration.
“ I give notice,” he shrieked, “ that I will leave
this den of infamy at the end of this week. lam
accustomed —I mean, I am not accustomed —
British constitution—degraded parody upon a
human being—l refuse to associate—l—dash and
onfound the—the—objectionable ruffian opposite
—insolent outrage upon all gentlemanly senti-
ment —gorilla on the other side of the table ”
t He gave out there, and choked. With a wild
howl ho heaved up the table and capsized the
ruins of it bodily at Bern, and then he tramped
heavily over the debris and engaged his enemy in
mortal combat. The Pole emerged from the
wreckage, and with his hair full of gravy, and
corned beef in both ears, and one eye stopped up
with cabbage, and mustard streaming down his
back, he flew at Johnson like a wild cat. The
candles went out; Mrs. Johnson shrieked in the
passage; the landlady wailed dismally in the
kitchen ; and all was horror and confusion.
* * *
There was an item in Johnson’s bill when
he left, which read ; “Broken crockery, 225. Od.”
I believe he hypothecated his lunch-bangle to pay
it. The gas has been turned on again since then,
and the landlady sings weird songs to us in the
gloaming, with her hair down as of old. She
wears the same green dress, and drops her shoes
all over the house as before, but it isn’t the same
landlady—the old one broke her neck on the stairs
as beforementioned, and her daughter has in-
herited her clothes and the business, and she rings
the dinner-bell with even more vim than her
lamented predecessor. She reminds me very much
of her mother, for she drops the meals on the stairs
in a way that calls up sad, pathetic memories ; and
rushes in as recklessly holding out the gravy in
front of her, and rushes out again as madly to
look for the vegetables, as her deceased relative
could have done. Johnson is in gaol somewhere—
there was a gap in his accounts which even his
jewellery could not fill; and his wife has eloped
with our new landlady's husband, the printer.
Also, nobody wears evening-dress in our boarding-
house any more.
TITUS SALT.
The Australian Desert: A Dream of
the Future.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Shunned and dreaded ; untrodden, drear ;
A realm of hunger, of thirst, of fear,
The desert heart of Australia lies,
An iron land, beneath brazen skies.
Where a dewless morn greets the summer days,
And the wide plains loom through a trembling
haze;
Where -with calm, still lakelets, ’neath shadowy
rocks,
The delusive mirage the wanderer mocks.
Where the pools of rain that fall fresh and sweet,
Turn salt ’ere they dry in the blistering heat.
Where the hot winds roam over scrub and sand ;
And the sun shines down on a lifeless land.
There, the passionless stars long vigils keep
O’er a silent waste, in a dreamless sleep.
Not even the wild dog’s cry is heard,
Nor the wailing hoot of a flitting bird.
At times, gaunt, meagre figures pass
Through the mulga scrub and the prickly grass,
Searching for roots ere the day expire,
Then, huddle close round the flickering fire.
Hungry and thirsty, at break of day
Rise, like black shadows, and stalk away.
Desert! You keep your secrets well
Of the gallant hearts who failed and fell;
You hold their bones in a close embrace,
You make no sign, and they left no trace.
Unrelenting, dire, in your sternest mood,
You watched them die in your solitude,
Your burning breast was their lonely bed ;
In the unknown land sleep the long-lost dead.
The time draws near when the low, bare hills
Will echo the songs of a thousand rills.
Deep down in the beds of the old-world streams,
They sleep unheeded, and dream their dreams ;
Till the magic drill bids them wake again,
And they rise to water the thirsty plain.
The whispering stalks of the maize grow higher;
Dor the scrub has fallen ’neath axe and fire.
Where the spinifex grew, ’midst the sandstone
rooks,
Browse the lowing herds, and the bleating flocks ;
And the sun now shines on the peaceful scene
Of farm,* and orchard, and vineyard green.
The iron horse has bridged the space
That only the camel before dared face.
Rippling downward in limpid waves,
The waters well from the sunless caves,
Till the bare lagoons, sun-baked and dried,
Are filled to the brim with the flowing tide.
And children play in the grassy glade
Where the lost explorers’ bones are laid.
ERNEST FAVENG.
The Hawthorn.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
By the road, near her father’s dwelling,
There groweth a hawthorn tree ;
Its blossoms are fair, and fragrant,
As the love that I cast from me.
It is all abloom this morning,
In the sunny silentness,
And glows by the roadside, radiant
As a bride in her bridal dress.
But, ah me ! at sight of its blossoms
No pleasant memories start;
I see but the thorns beneath them'—
And the thorns they pierce my heart.

While his hot breath thick with the taint of beer,
Came forth from his lips in a drunken jeer,
SriU'ed h im ,
And ekd in grey, one and all drf pray
Then the captain left him in mild despair,
But before the music took up its blare
A pale-faced lassie stepped out and spoke—
A sad little girl in a sad grey cloak —
“ Rise up, Kelly, your work’s to do,
Kelly, the Saviour’s a-calling you. ’_
He strove to look wise, rubbed at his eyes, _
Looked down at the earth, looked up at the skies,
And something that p’raps was his conscience
He seemed’perplex’d as again he heard
The girl with the garments of saddest hue
Say, “Kelly, the Saviour’s a calling you.”
• • • • • • •
He got on his knees and thence to his feet,
And stumbled away down the dustv street;
Contrived to cadge at the “ pub.” a drink,
But still in his ear the glasses chink
And jingle out to the one refrain,
Clear as the lassie’s voice again :
“Kelly, Kelly, come here to me.
Kelly the Eager, I ve work for thee
He trembled, and dropped the tumbler, and slopped
The beer on the counter the barman stopped,
With a curious eye on his haggard face,
Kelly, old fellow, you re going the pace,
Don t you fancy it s time to take
A pull on yourself, put your foot on the brake ?
You 11 have the horrors, without a doubt.
This time next week, if you don t look out.
But he didn t he sobered himself that night.
And “ that time next week ’’ he was nearly right,
Yet still at the mill, tho he d stopped the grog,
As the saw bit into the green pine log,
The wood shrieked out to him in its pain,
A fragment caught up the one refrain,
As the swift teeth cut and the sawdust flew—
“ Kelly, Kelly, I’ve work for you.”
Then the seasons fell and the floods came down
And laid the dust in the silent town;
No more the beat of hoofs and feet
Was heard the length of the crooked street,
For, leaving counter and desk and till,
All had fled to the far sandhill;
But everywhere that a man might dare
Risk life to save it, Kelly was there.
No more the voice had a tale to tell,
He’d found his work and he did it well—
Who stripped leggings and hat and coat
To swim the lagoon and procure the boat?
Who pushed out in the dead of night
At the mute appeal of a beacon-light?
Who was blessed by the women then,
And who was cheered by the stalwart men,
As he shot the rapids above the town
With two pale Smiths and a weeping Brown,
Landing them safe from his cockleshell,
Woefully frightened, but safe and well,
WRh their friends on the sandhill all secure-
Who but Kellj you may be sure ?
They reckoned the heads up, one by one,
And be sighed as he thought that the work was
done.
But soon found out that ’twas not begun;
They counted away till it came to pass
They missed the little Salvation lass;
She’d been to pray with a man who lay
Sick on the river-shore, far away.
Men looked askance and the women smote
Their hands in grief, as he launched the boat,
And said, as he cast the painter loose :
“ Who’ll make another ? It’s little use
My going alone, for I’m nearly done,
And from here to the point is a stiffish run.”
Then one stepped forward and took an oar,
And the boat shot out for the other shore.
To and fro, where the gums hang low
And bar their passage, the comrades row
Hard, up-stream, where the waters race,
Steady, where floating branches lace,
Though many a danger and quick escape
And catch of breath, as the timbers scrape
_And thrill to the touch of some river shape,
Till at last the huts on the point draw near,
And over their shoulders the comrades peer.
The flood was running from door to door,
Two feet six on the earthen floor,
Half-way up to the bed it ran,
Where two pale women and one sick man
Crouched, and looked at the water’s rise,
With horror set in their staring eyes,
While the children wept, as the water crept,
But how the blood to their hearts high leapt
As over the threshold the rescuers stepped,
And, wrapped in blanket and shawl and coat,
Carried the saved to the crazy boat.
Then Kelly circled the little lass
With his strong right arm, and as in a glass
Saw himself in her eyes that shone
Sweet, in a face that was drawn and wan,
And he felt that for her life he’d give his own ;
Too short a moment her cheek was pressed
Close to the beat of his spray-wet breast,
While her hair just lay like a golden ray,
The last farewell of a passing day.
Gently he settled her down in the stern
With a tender smile, and had time to turn
To look to the others, and then he saw
That the craft was full and could hold no more.
He looked at the party, old, young and sick,
While he had no tie, neither wife nor chick.
Then—with a shove he sent out the boat
Far on the turbid stream afloat.
“ Pull !” said Kelly. “Now pull,” said he,
“ Pull with your load and come back for me,
You may be late, but at any rate
I’m better able than you to wait.”
They pulled and, looking back, saw him stand
Shading his eyes with his big, rough hand—
Silent, patient, and smiling-faced,
With the water curling around his waist.
Return they did, but they found him not,
Nought but the chimney then marked the spot;
They found him not when the boat went back,
Never a trace of him, never a track,
Only the sigh and the dreary cry
Of the gums that had wept to see him die:
These alone had a tale to tell
Of a life that had ended passing well—
The sad refrain of a hero’s fate
Tuned in a tongue we may not translate.
Facing Death with a bold, brave heart,
Chosing the nobler and better part;
Home to the land of eternal sun
Kelly had gone, for his work was done.
SURCINGLE.
An Idyll of the Season.
(WELL-SEASONED.)
I held her to my breast
In a vyce,
And was numbered with the blest
(She was nice).
Her responsive squeeze I felt—
Ah ! in Paradise we dwelt;
We were warm enough to melt
Tons of ice.
I told her of my love
’Twixt our grips :
There was mistletoe above,
And our lips
In a tender fashion met;
’Twas with honey hers were wet,
And this infant took, you Ltt I
Many sips.
We gave no heed to time,
No, nor place;
Oh ! what ecstasy sublime
To embrace !
I saw her eyelids close
As I stole her yellow rose,
For I envied its repose
’Midst the lace.
“ Are you married ?” quoth the maid,
With a wink;
Through the floor I felt afraid
I should sink.
But the truth I soon confess’t,
And she murmured on my chest,
“ Dear, the married ones are best,
Don’t you think ?
“ For they spoon and never tell
Other chaps.”
So I answered, “ Darling, well,
Yes, perhaps
You can trust them, as you say,
In a quiet sort of way,
And be happy while ye may—
On their laps.”
Then I took her on my knee—
Further bliss !
It was Christmastime, you see,
Same as this;
And I said, as fellows do,
“ When I’ve buried You-know-who,
Will my pet be Number Two ?”
(Answer —kiss).
Then the Missis came along
On the sly;
I had said she “ wasn’t strong ”
What a lie !
She gave that maid a shake
Which, I’m certain, made her ache,
And I had to get some steak
For my eye.
Thus the maiden and the bard
Were dispers’t ;
From my “second” I’m debarred
By my ‘ 1 first. ”
Though the married men are best,
As my vanished love confess’t,
I have heard my wife protest
“ They’re the worst.”

To Messrs. Colemane and Sons, Coota-
mundra.—Gentlemen,—Having received much
benefit from the use of your Victory Ointment
and Volatile Eucalypte, I can, with confidence,
recommend to all who suffer from skin diseases
the use of same. During the past nine years I
suffered from a most annoying skin disease on my
face, caused by the bite of a fly, and 'though the
most eminent doctors in this colony treated me
for the complaint, it gained ground and threatened
to unfit me for business. Acting on the advice of
a friend, I determined to try your Victory Oint-
ment and Volatile Eucalypte; the result has been
most successful. In cases of bronchitis and colds
I have used your Volatile Eucalypte with success,
and in a case which I met in the bush far away
from medical aid, it saved a life.—l am, gentle-
men, &c., D. M. Campbell. Cootamundra,

“Christmas, 1891.”
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
A " Merry Christmas !” Aye, the bells are pealing
With joyous clangs of gladness and surprise ;
The light of Peace to broken hearts revealing,
The light of Love to sorrow-laden eyes.
A Merry Christmas ! spread abroad the tidings
Through all their channels let Joy’s streamlets J nice
Till the swift currents’ meetings and dividings
Drown all with joy too deep for utterance.
Yea, let us echo it o'er earth and ocean,
Till earth and sea with joy-pants heave and thrill,
Echoing with all their deep souls’deep emotion,
“ Peace upon earth, and unto men good-will! ”
Joy ! joy ! the end of human strife and weeping—
From each sad eye He wipes the tears for aye ;
The whole wide universe in peace is sleeping.
Let us be merry ; Christ was born to-day.
So, let us bear our joyous Christmas greeting
To brother and to sister, one by one,
And welcome them, while hands and lips are meeting,
With gladsome tidings of the victory won.
And first to you—dim eyes, back bent with labour,
Dull brain, toil-coarsened heart, toil-hardened hand,
United and warped—how is it with you, neighbour?
I fear me that you do not understand.
What, though you earn your crust with bitter toiling,
The common lot of all your common clay—
t)f light, of life, of love your souls despoiling?
Tis nothing ; think that Christ was born to-day.
God willed that you should be a slave, a chattel,
Of him who owns you, as he “owns” your soil,
Less valued than his meanest, lowliest cattle—
So, Merry Christmas to you, man of toil.
Next you, whose straitened brow and furtive glances
Proclaim the man at war with all his kind ;
Whose life is one long strife with risks and chances,
A gaol in front, an iron fate behind.
Horn thief, born homicide, born but to perish,
Fixed type, that sways.or alters not with time—
Your stunted soul the news will gladly cherish,
So, Merry Christmas to you, man of crime !
Next, haggard, drunken ; you that “ should he woman,’
Unwomanlike, besmirched with maudlin tears,
Bearing to-day your monstrous cross inhuman,
Unchanged for all the nineteen-hundred years
Since Christ bore His; go, buy your bread with sinning,
Sell to unlovely lust your kisses brute ;
Foredoomed to shame before your life’s beginning—
A Merry Christmas to you—Prostitute !
Enough, enough. Thus much of shame and sorrow,
Thus much, and more than tongue or pen can tell,
Is with us ; and we know not if a morrow
Shall dawn, whose sun shall chase the reek of hell.
Loud ring the joy-bells, jubilant and cheering ;
Half-drowned I hear men’s curses, women’s tears ;
So those blythe bells to my distempered hearing
Sound less like angels’ laugh them devils’ sneers.
Molong, N.S. Wales.
PAX VORISCUM.
Christmas Shopping and other Matters
Such as desire to see an ingenious present-
ment of Gnome-laud, we would strongly advise
to call in at Mr. Leon Harris’ jevvel-sl.op, Market-
street, next door to Hunter’s Boot Palace. The
picture is realistic. The quaint little miners are
hard at work smiting the mountain with their
hatchets, eager to secure the gems, which, ignis
fatuus- like, glance in and out among the rocks.
This clever design embellishes the window, but,
indoors, Mr. Harris can show a beautiful collection
of precious stones, both native and foreign, and
his artistic method of setting and clever groupings
of the different stones is above all praise. Old-
fashioned jewellery in his hands becomes trans-
formed into a thing of beauty. It is only fair to
add that Mr. Harris’ prices are as modest as his
work is first-rate.

Who does not enjoy an hour in Dymock’s
Book Arcade in George-street ? Here the book-
worms are to be seen at all times of the day,
fondly handling the beloved volumes, and making
their purchases according to the capacity of their
purses. It is a foregone conclusion that if a
certain book cannot be obtained at Dymock’s, it
is useless to try for it anywhere else in Sydney.
This firm is also showing a splendid assortment
of toys this year, the large showroom upstairs
being replete with all the latest novelties in the
way of mechanical toys, speaking dolls, silent and
sleeping dolls—in fact, everything the childish
heart can desire is to be found at Dymock’s.

Now that the summer is fairly upon us,
“ Macfie’s Cold Water Soap ” should claim a place
in every laundry. It possesses manifold virtues,
but the greatest is its power to cleanse clothes
without the aid of heat. When it is used in-
telligently, according to the instructions on each
tin, no boiling is necessary, therefore, there is a
saving both of fuel and discomfort, and the poor
laundress is no longer under the necessity of first
steaming herself over the hot suds, then roasting
herself over the copper fire. And, apart from
these considerations, by using Macfie’s Cold Water
Soap, it has been proved that the clothes are not
rotted as by using soda and common soap. It
has also the effect of whitening and softening the
hands, and why should not a laundress enjoy soft,
white hands ? Therefore, remember Macfie’s Cold
Water Soap.

Some of the prettiest and most appropriate
Christmas cards for sending Home this year are
those made by Mrs. Clarence White from the
Australian wild flowers. Great care is needed in
preparing these flowers so that the colours are
preserved, and Mrs. White has made quite a
success of her undertaking.
It is most convenient to have a first-class
room near tram stopping places, where ladies
can rest themselves, and if they choose, have a
good cup of tea, or other refreshments. We
understand the Country Milk Go’s. “Cascade”
80 & 82 Elizabeth-street, near King-street, is just
the place; it is certainly the largest and best
conducted room in Sydney, and is getting quite
the fashionable resort for afternoon tea. We also
understand that ladies who so desire can have
parcels sent there so that they can call for them
just before taking the tram for home.*
COLEMANE & SONS, COOTAMUNDRA.
Dear Sirs, —One of your travelling agents called
on me some time ago, and I bought from him a
few bottles of your Eucalypte, and also a few
boxes of your ointment. Your agent having
convinced me that it was a medicine of no mean
order, I began by trying its efficiency on a poor
woman that has been suffering a long time (nearly
two years) with an abscess on the side of her nose,
so small that you cannot perceive it, but you can
feel that it is about the size of a pea just under the
eye. Sometimes it breaks out, and runs through
the nose. She had tried all the doctors in Goul-
burn, and they failed to do her any good. One
said it was rheumatism ; another said the bone
was beginning to decay; and the third doctor
said it was an abscess. She had used two boxes of
your ointment, and two bottles of the Eucalypte,
and says that it has done her more good than all
the doctors. Yours, etc.,
S. BROWN. Lake Bathurst.
TO MESSRS. COLEMANE AND SONS,
COOTAMUNDRA.
Gentlemen.—Having received much benefit
from the use of your Victory Ointment and
Volatile Eucalypte, I can with confidence
recommend it to all who suffer from Piles, either
blind or bleeding, as I have been using it since
Christmas myself and I find it has done me more
good than anything that I have tried for many
years. I have been a great sufferer from botti
kinds, and I have tried several doctors and none
of them have given me anything to do them good,
but your Victory Ointment and Eucalypte have
been most successful in easing the pain and
checking the bleeding. I also find it a beautiful
thing in cases of cold and fog-fever, as I have
tried it with good results on my own children.
You can make whatever use you like of this for
the benefit of the public.—l am, Sirs, Yours,
faithfully, Mrs. H. Weeks, Jerrawa, 18th Feb.,
1888.

To know that a single application of the Cuticura Reme-
dies will, in the great majority of cases, afford instant and complete
relief, permit rest and sleep, and point
to a permanent and economical (because
so speedy) cure, and not to use them
without a moment’s delay, is to be guilty
of positive inhumanity. [No greater leg-
acy can be bestowed upon a child than
a skin without blemish and a body nour-
ished with pure blood.

Remedies are the greatest skin
cures, blood purifiers, and humor reme-
dies, are absolutely pure, and may be used from pimples to scrofula,
from infancy to age, with the most gratifying and unfailing success.
Treatment. Cuticura, the great skin cure, and Cuticura Soar, an exquisite
skin purifier and beautifier, externally, instantly allay the most intense itching, burn-

impurities and poisonous elements, and thus removes the cause.

The “ HAMMOND” has been awarded highest Honours over all competitors for both
“ SPEED” and “ BEST WORK.”
The Franklin Scientific Institute, which examined all makes of Typewriters, report on the
“Hammond:” —“This Typewriter imposes no limitation upon the speed of the operator . . its
general mechanical construction is excellent. . . Celerity and certainty of operation, perfection
of alignment, and great durability in service, are meritorious features which the Hammond machine
possesses in an eminent degree, and the Committee commend it as the BEST TYPEWRITING
MACHINE that has come to their knowledge. In conclusion, the Committee believe that the invention of the im-
nressinn and feedimr mechanism, as well as the perfection attained in the construction of this instrument, are deserv-
hig of the Highest Award in the gift of the Institute, and the grant of the ELLIOTT CRESSON GOLD MEDAL to
James B. Hammond, the inventor, is accordingly recommended.”

Head —‘ A Golden Shanty.’
Asked what he thought of the N.S.W.
Womanhood Suffrage League, Major Rae, the
midget, replied, “ I guess they are daffy hen-
pickers, all the lot of them.”
The story goes that a penurious Sydney
medico some time since bought, at auction, a job-
lot of boy’s paper-collars, intending to dispose of
them at considerable profit to his very juvenile
groom. But when he got them home he found
that they would not ht. And ever since, the
story goes on to say, he has kept a sharp look-out
for a boy with a number seven neck.
A sign of the days in which we live is that
both the Sydney Sunday papers are strongly Pro-
tectionist. The reading of the sign is that the
day of Freetrade is done in N.S. Wales. No
paper ever starts on Freetrade principles now-a-
days, as papers used to of yore. Those papers
which were thus suckled in Freetrade have been
compelled by force of groove to remain so, but the
newcomer is almost invariably Protectionist.
A Pentridge prisoner who tried to hang
himself is to be punished for casting contempt on
the deterrent terrors of the Law ! We submit the
problem here indicated for the thoughtful con-
sideration of the logicians of Australia. How do
the penal authorities propose to deter the man
who wants to die ? And, assuming that he doesn’t
always want to die, but only attempts suicide
when his intellect is unusually aberrated, how do
they propose to punish him for manifesting
symptoms of insanity ?
Hear Bulletin, —-What is the derivation
of the Australian slang word “ringer?” It is
much in use amongst shearers, the “ ringer of the
shed ” being the man who makes the biggest tally
of sheep shorn, and hence the expression “he’s a
regular ringer,” has come into our everyday
vocabulary as synonymous with smartness and
agility. Carbine’s a “regular ringer ”on the
turf, Tommy Bent at land-b oming, and so on. I
am by no means sure that the word, as commonly
supposed, hailed originally from the woolshed. I
remember the expression 20 years ago amongst the
alluvial miners of the M.L. west coast. The
digger, who on panning off a prospect obtained a
circle of “colours” completely surrounding the
bottom of his dish called it a “ringer.” And the
same term may in time have began to be applied
generally as a means of expressing appreciation. —

Sydney, September, 14th, 1888. To
Messrs. Colemane and Sons, Cootamundra. —Dear
Sirs, —It is with pleasure I take the opportunity
of writing to you, to let you know the wonderful
benefit I derived from your Eucalypte Extract.
Some time ago, if you remember, I wrote to you
from Camden, relative to a complaint of the lungs,
which at the time I was suffering from, and were
it not for your Extract I am sure I would be now
in my grave. I felt so bad that my voice was
gone, and the cough I was subject to would have
killed me, were it not for your Eucalypte Extract,
which has now, thank God, restored me to health.
I remain, yours sincerely, Patrick Carroll, 242

The Theatre Royal Hotel, Sydney, has
lately changed hands, and is now under entirely
new management. A splendid stock of wines,
spirits, liqueurs and cigars has been laid in, and
an altogether new feature is provided in the shape
of an American bar, where all the strange, curious
and refreshing drinks known in the United States
can be obtained. Their name is legion, but among
them may be mentioned champagne cocktails,
gin fizz, milk punch, mint julep—probably the
noblest liquor known to man—imperial punch,
Manhattan cocktails, and many others. All

The Melbourne police seem to have a
“soft thing on ” (and off) in poor old John Starling,
an habitual criminal who works under the dis-
advantage of a glass eye. John’s mania is for
picking pockets, and at irregular intervals during
the past twenty years he has been allowed out of
gaol that he might provide the active and intelli-
gent “coppers” with a few days’ sport. The
miserable fool invariably wanders off to a busy
thoroughfare, with his one genuine optic fixed on
the main chance, and its long-lost brother repre-
sented by a glassy glare, whilst a myrmidon of
the law shepherds him on the side where he can’t
see. In due course John’s offending paw is caught
under incriminating circumstances and the authori-
ties welcome their old friend back to gaol after
his brief airing. From a sporting point of view
this is a flagrant case of cruelty to animals. It is
much the same as hunting a three-legged hare, or
potting a partridge that has had its wings clipped.
Humanity cries aloud against any more letting of
John Starling loose upon a world where he has no
chance to follow the only trade left open to him.
He has just been sent up again for 12 months,
with a fair prospect, as his counsel pointed out, of
“ laying his poor old bones on a death-bed in the
gaol,” and if he should survive this sentence, he
ought to be promptly put out of his misery with a
{)oll-axe. Armed burglars and other violent
unatics are permitted to ravage Melbourne pretty
nearly as they please, all the time that detectives
are effecting clever captures of lame “drunks,” or
playing blind-man’s-buff with a one-eyed pick-
pocket.

Woolner, the sculptor—whose acquaint-
ance Parkes formed in Sydney in 1854 when he
was running the Empire —was very canny when
he presented New South Wales, through Premier
Parkes, with Turner’s great picture entitled
“London—Autumnal Morning ” (the picture was
exhibited by Turner at the Royal Academy of
Arts in the year before his election as an acade-
mician). The gift was intended to mark Wool-
ner’s “ remembrance of the kindness and hospi-
tality received from the inhabitants of Sydney ”
during his visit in 1854. Twenty-eight years he
took to make up his mind ! The gift proved to
be a good investment. Wi olner got numerous
commissions from Parkes, an 1 but for the advent
of the Dibbs Administration the sculptor would
now be engaged upon statues of Wentworth,
Cowper, and Martin at a cost of 3000 guineas
each to the province. Parkes has always been a
liberal patron of the fine arts —at the people’s
expense. His very latest order was for 80 statues
in stone, at ,£2OO each, to fill the niches in the
fronts of the public buildings ; .£9450 plus .£16,000
is .£25,450 worth of extravagant loan-expenditure
nipped in the bud ! Hurrah for Parkes and
“good Government ” !

The original MS. of Cary’s translation of Dante is some-
where in N.S.W., Judge Cary, a son of the translator,
having had it in his possession in Sydney.
The MS. above referred to was. I think, in the
possession of Mr, Samuel H. Smyth, late manager
of the Sydney Marine Insurance Co., of George-
street, Sydney, who was an intimate friend of the
late Judge Cary up to the time of his death, June
30, 1870. Other valuable manuscript was also
held by Mr. Smyth, but what has become of it I
know not. Judge Cary translated “ Herodotus ”
and “ Homer.” A copy of the former translation
he presented to the Public Library of Sydney
prior to his accepting the position of Chairman of
Quarter Sessions, I think in 1857 or 1858.—Yours
faithfully, Yirtute Excerpive,

Gleaming Australian Gems.
THE BEAUTY OF QUEENSLAND OPALS.
It is about ten years since opals were discovered
in Queensland, near Thargomindah, and it is
now known there is a band of “country” con-
taining these gems running right through from
“ Whitecliffs,” in New South Wales, to Cape
York, the extreme point of the first-named colony.
The gems are found mostly in “pockets,” in a
pipeclay formation, and are rarely to be found
below a depth of from 2ft, to 12ft. from the sur-
face. The best of this class of jewels comes from
“Whitecliffs,” and two very large parcels have
recently been received by Messrs. James M ‘Bean
and Son, jewellers, of Elizabeth Street, who
possess very extensive but at the same time simple
machinery for converting the rough glass-like stone
of the ground into the beautiful jewel of commerce.
The stones, having been cut and polished, are
worthy of the adornment of the proudest lady in
the land; and set in gold, as necklets or bracelets,
they are rich almost beyond compare, containing
as they do all the glittering hues of the rainbow,
and assuming a different “flash of colour” at
every movement. They are by no means of the
dull, milky, uninteresting colour commonly
ascribed to opals, but, on the contrary, promise to
be some of the most popular and attractive gems
of the day as they become better known through-
out the world. This they are sure to be as the
output becomes greater and the industry grows
larger. There used to be an absurd superstition
that opals were an “unlucky” stone, but that
idea is rapidly passing away, and will certainly
be entirely stamped out when the brilliant Aus-
tralian opal becomes better known. The most
recently polished of these now on view at the
jeweller’s above-mentioned are well worthy the
inspection of connoisseurs of such bijouterie. —

THE BEALE PATENT ■
HIGH ARM SEWING MACHINES
Have, by their continued merits and the general
satisfaction they have invariably given, won the
first place in public esteem, and are on all sides
admitted to be the best and most useful sewing
machines in the market.
FOR USE IN THE HOUSEHOLD
The Beale Machine presents innumerable advant-
ages. The mechanism and the are
perfect, while the working is most simple; and
the addition of all the most recent inventions and
improvements renders the manipulation of every-
thing connected with the machine a matter, of
perfect ease. The result of this is, that with
ordinary care the machine will last for many
years, nothing can get out of cider, and no time
is wasted in tiresome meddling w ith the parts.
It is a servant that will never grumble, never
rebel, never want nights out, willing even on
washing days. It only asks for a careful cleaning
now and then, a snug, dry corner and a little
genuine sewing machine oil. Any other oil will
make it sick, and dirt of all kind it abhors.
The Self-threading Shuttle, of solid sttel,
saves the trouble of threading by the end of the
cotton. It has an excellent tension, is strong and
simple.
The Bobbin Winder is a marvel of in-
genuity, winding and guiding the cotton by
itself, as evenly as upon the reel whence it came,
and stopping of its own accord when the bobbin
is full.
For all kinds of family sewing and fancy the
Beale Machine has the greatest capacity.
The Improved High Arm. A great de-
sideratum with ladies has been the raising of the
arm of the machine, so as to allow the goods to be
sewn freely to pass underneath. This had to be
accomplished without increasing the weight of the
machine. In fact, the Beale runs with wonderful
ease and rapidity. It is almost silent, all clicking
sounds having been obviated. As is well known,
a good test of the finish of any mechanism is its
silence when in rapid motion.
With the Wonderful Beale Machine,
whether for hand or foot use, you can hem any
width, make double seams or fells, braid stitch
with chenille, Berlin wool, or gold cord, and such
like fancy work ; you may make a pretty lace
stitch, tuck ever so finely, bind dresses, coats, or
carpets ; sew on trimmings without guiding, make
frilling, ruffling, or ruching; quilt, weave your
own braid with any combination of colours and
stitch it on at the same lime; make thick, woollen
door-mats, embroidered antimacassars, window
curtains, and so forth ; you can easily and rapidly
perform the fashionable shirring or gathering so
popular for sleeves, bodies, or skirts of dresses
with an appliance supplied gratis ; lay the small
cords in hoods and stays ;do large cording; gather
with or without a band, and generally do all
kinds of straight sewing upon any material what-
ever. You can darn upon any woven goods, and
do crewel-work. The Beale Patent will pass
from eight folds of tweed or twenty of calico to
two of thinnest muslin, or even mosquito-net or
tulle, without the operator changing needle,
cotton, stitch, or tension, and the fine material
will not be gathered in the slightest. You may
make button and eyelet-holes, do over-casting,
make herring-bone stitch upon any materials.
This work is absolutely unique and can only be
accomplished upon the Beale Patent Machine,
Any of these performances will be shown at our
shops at any time. The Beale Patent makes
a lock-stitch, which cannot ravel, yet by a momen-
tary alteration the sewing can be done so as to
rip from end to end, if desired. This peculiarity
is sometimes useful when children’s clothes are
intended to be altered.
Nickel-plating. —In our climate the exposed
parts of the machine, and the applicances, need
to be protected from rust. We have, at consider-
able expense, added a handsomely nickeled wheel,
nickeled plates, screws, appliances, treadle-bar
and cones. Heightening the appearance, these
improvements also tend largely to preserve the
parts. This plating is imperishable.
A special feature of The Beale Machine is
that
ALL THE CABINET WORK ,
is made at our factory in Sydney from registered
designs, and of the choicest
AUSTRALIAN WOODS,
some of which are without doubt the most beauti-
ful in the world. Suitability to the climate is
thus insured, and we are enabled to offer a greater
variety of styles, most handsome in design and
conveniently fitted for all the requirements of a
lady’s work-table.
These machines can be inspected at any time at
our principal show-rooms in Sydney, or at any of
our suburban and country branch shops, or from
travellers who are continually visiting all parts.
All the machines may be had upon easy time-
navment, or for cash less three shillings in the
pound.

CHRISTMAS,
1891.
THIS MANIFESTO
Is published for the benefit of all those persons —high or low, rich or poor —who, from possible ignorance of their existence,
and of their high claims upon public confidence, have hitherto ignored the use of
H. H. WARNER & CO.'S 7I SIFP REMEDIES,
in numerous cases, in which their application would be calculated to become curative. Many individuals, we know, are
in the habit of rejecting all patented productions indiscriminately, and with regard to some of them, perhaps, not with-
out reason, but it is
Olaimed for 11. B. Warner C®.’3 Safe Remedies,
that in every instance, when applicable to the symptoms of the patient (if taken according to directions), they tend at once
to ameliorate his or her condition, and, if persevered with, will accomplish a perfect cure. Unfortunately, it frequently
happens that these people put themselves to a very large expense before flying to our medicines for relief, thus actually
risking their lives by delay. We earnestly protest against so reckless a system, and strongly recommend that an early
test of our specifics be made. It is to be particularly observed that so pure and perfectly prepared are they, that no harm
can possibly arise from their use, as directed. The following recently-received
TEBTIMOKTIAL.B
are inserted for the encouragement of the wavering At the same time, we heartily wish them and all your readers,
M Merry Christmas and Happy New Tear
through the anticipated use of
Warner’s Celebrated “ Safe” Cure,
and that Company’s other effective Medicines.
Safe Cure successful in case of Sluggish Elver.
H. H. WARNER & CO., Melbourne.
Albury, N.S.W., October 22, 1891.
Dear Sirs,— Just a few lines in testimony of the efficacy of your valuable Safe Cure. After travelling through India and the East, and return-
ing to Australia, I was often attacked with a terrible drowsiness, caused, I suppose, through sluggish liver. A friend of mine was using your remedy,
Safe Cure [wise man !], and asked me to try it. I did so, and felt relief almost from the first. I have been a staunch advocate of your
remedies ever since.—l am, dear sirs, yours gratefully,
D. M. BROW NE, Theatrical Agent.

Messrs. H. H. WARNER & CO.
Mount Blackwood, November 9, 1891.
Gentlemen, —I hereby beg to state that, in October, 1890, I was suffering from severe pains in my right side, and also across my back. After
a little time my eyesight began to fail—especially the right eye —and became so bad that I was unable to get about the place without the assistance
of my wife. I then went to a professional oculist in Melbourne, being under him live months, but received not the least benefit from the treatment.
I next applied to the Melbourne Hospital, but was refused admission, as they could do nothing for mo. After this I returned home. (Seeing that my
water was very thick, I thought your Safe Cure might do me good. I commenced to take it about four months ago, and from the first bottle found
relief. 1 have been taking it ever since, with the result that all my pains have left me- my eyesight has so much improved that 1 can get about by
myself, and do my own gardening —my appetite is good, and I sleep well. lam quite certain 1 owe my life to your Safe Cure, and I send you this,
testimonial that others, who perhaps may be suffering as I was, may see it. My age is GO.

Wonderful Results of H>li@umatic Cure.
Chew toil, Victoria, October 4, 1891.
Messrs. 11. H. WARNER & CO.
g mS) j have used your Safe Rheumatic Cure with wonderful results, it having proved effectual when all other remedies failed, and doctors could
do nothin"- for me. Working in wet mines had brought on acute rheumatism. 1 did not take much heed at first, thinking it would soon pass oft;
but I continued to get worse month after month, until at last I was obliged to take to my bed. 1 then tried several remedies, and consulted the
doctors, but derived no benefit. About this time Warner's Safe Rheumatic Cure was brought under my notice, and I commenced its use and very
soon got relief. After taking seven bottles, T was able to go. about my work. lam thankful to say 1 have not had any attack during the past two
years’" which fact proves that i am fully cured.

sincerely declare as follows :
Whereas, I suffered very severely from a very
troublesome affection of the Nerves, which affected me so
much that I was quite unable to attend to my business—
that of a Merchant Tailor. I tried several Doctors and
many Remedies, but all of no avail. Whereas, I, as a
last hope obtained some of Herr Rassmussen’s
PURELY HERBAL “ DENMARK UNI-
VERSAL PILLS,” which I hereby solemnly and
sincerely declare COMPLETELY CURED ME within a
few weeks, and although this is now over five years ago, I
have remained well ever since.
The DENMARK UNIVERSAL PILLS also cured
my wife, and I make this solemn declaration, conscientiously
believing the same to be true.

Read the Reports from Sydney Papers.
Let it be distinctly understood that this is no
scheme of quackery to draw money out of the
afflicted, nor is it any sort of a patent medicine
humbug, since there is not a grain of medicine of any
kind required in the treatment. Notwithstanding
this fact, it takes directly hold of the worst cases
of constipation, dyspepsia, liver complaints, head-
aches, heart disease, incipient consumption,
diabetes, and Bright’s disease of the kidneys, in-
cluding fevers and inflammation of the lungs, and
of other internal organs—not by attacking these
so-called diseases directly, but by radically neutra-
lising and removing their causes, thus allowing
nature herself to do her work unimmded.
We now simply repeat that the new treatment
acts so radically and fundamentally upon the vital
circulation without the least danger to the most
delicate constitution, that there is not a form of
disease that flesh is heir to, which will not be
affected favorably to the patient by an intelligent
use of this method of treatment.
In selling this Pamphlet we are obliged to re-
require a “ Pledge of Honor ” from those purchas-
ing it, not to show or reveal its contents outside
of their own families. This is for our own protec-
tion, and as the only means by which our just
rights in the discovery can be mamtained.
Doctors, of course, who purchase are not debarred
from using the treatment in their own practice,
providing they do not show the pamphlet or do not
reveal the rationale of the treatment.
The Australian Temperance World says;—“ We can
thoroughly recommend it as a genuine treatment that
must benefit most all disorders. It requires no outlay
after purchasing the pampnlet. It is based upon
thoroughly hygienic principles, and we believe every
thorough user must receive benefit. One great considera-
tion with ladies will be that it secures a clear skin and
speedily' does away with a muddy complexion, and
removes all eruptions arising from diseased conditions of
the blood. We have made ourselves familiar with the
pamphlet, and heartily endorse it.”
Presbyterian, of July 4, says:—“We have seen the
pamphlet, and can thoroughly recommend its rationale.”
The Freeman’s Journal says“ After a careful perusal
of the pamphlet we have no hesitancy in recommending
the treatment which Dr. Hall discovered.”
The Sydney Mail says:—“ We have seen the pamphlet,
and, although we cannot reveal its secrets, we can bear
testimony to the 6 ona-fides of the advertisement.”
Martin’s Home and Farm says:—“ We can recommend
it as a genuine thing.”
The Aultralian Star says:—“ It is thoroughly purify-
ing, hygienic, and rational in the highest degree.”
Truth says:—“ It is beyond a doubt all that is claimed
for it.”
Sunday Times says“ It will, we believe, where cure
is not possible, assist in alleviating ; and to folks suffering
from habitual constipation, indigestion, deficient cir-
culation, and poorness of blood, it cannot fail to be of
benefit.”
Brisbane Evbnino Observer says:—“ A feature of the
treatment is that it requires no extra expense after the
first cost of the pamphlet, and can be applied as easily in
the bush as in the city.”
The Echo, Bulletin, and other leading papers speak in
similar unqualified terms.
Australian Independent says:—“To suffering humanity
we regard the discovery as a wonderful boon."
The following testimonials from ministers, doctors, and private persons speak for them-
selves and they are but a drop in the bucket of the thousands received :
DR. R. F. STEVENS’ INDORSEMENT,
Dr. Stevens, of Syracuse, N.Y., was the first
M.D. to whom we revealed the new treatment —
more than 20 years ago. In writing to a friend,
about a year ago, he gives the following :
* * * * * “Nearly twenty years ago in this city Dr. A.
Wilford Hall gave me privately a detailed history of a
hygienic treatment he had discovered and adopted some
twenty years before, and which he had practised con-
tinuously upon himself up to that time. The history
included an account of the failure of the health, the
reasonings and conclusions which led him to adopt the
treatment, his rapid restoration to health, &o. From the
time of his first mention of it to me I have been entirely
satisfied that it saved him from a lingering consumption
and death ; and that in the years following, as I have evi-
dence to satisfy me, its continued practice has so affected
the nutrient and eliminating functions as to give to his
physical structure a greater degree of solidity, or, in
other words, a higher specific gravity than that possessed
by any other man living. I learn that he has persistently
continued the treatment to the present time - forty years
in all—and that his present health and vigorous condition
may rightfully be compared to the ‘bloom of youth,’
though he is pearly seventy years of age. The tests I
have made of the treatment upon myself and in my prac-
tice in the twenty years past, have convinced me that
great practical benefit may be derived by members of the
medical profession and others from a careful study of the
rationale of the treatment as discovered by Dr. Hall, the
details of which he proposes to give in his forthcoming
book. A debt of gratitude will surely be due to him for
whatever scientific advances he may be able to unfold in
the line of assisting nature to ward off disease, and in the
restoration of health.— R. F. Stevens, M.D.”
“ Sydney, 11th August, 1891.
“ Mr. J. C. Oakman. —Dear Sir, —I have great pleasure
in recommending Dr. A. Wilford Hall’s treatment, as I
have derived great hem fit from its use. 1 have for years
been suffering from torpid liver, dyspepsia, constipation,
and the last two years from inward piles ; but after the
use of Dr. A. W. Hall’s treatment for about two months
I find myself entirely cured of that very painful com-
plaint the piles, and all my other troubles are getting
gradually less, and I firmly believe that a continuation of
this treatment will restore me to perfect health again. I
shall be very happy to give any one any further informa-
tion if deserved.—Yours very truly, Robert Tarin, 231
Goulburn-street, Surry Hills.”
“ Wellshot Station, Ist August, 1891.
“ Mr. J. C. Oakman, 8 O’Connell-street, Sydney.—Dear
Sir, —Yours of July 14 to hand. Thank you very much
tor your kind offer, to help me in case I could not under-
stand thoroughly the pamphlet or if I found difficulty in
applying the treatment. It is not the case. I understand
English as well as French, and as for the treatment it has
already done a world of good, and the pamphlet is worth
hundred times the money. If it had been translated in
French I would have advised some friends and
relations at home to buy it. This is the
reason why I was asking, and 1 hope it will soon
be translated in every known language and spread
all over the world. I have been suffering from dyspepsia
for the last 20 years, and a few days of this treatment
has done me more good and given me more relief than
all the remedies I ever tried before.—l am, dear sir, yours
faithfully, Jude Derbexy.”
The distinguished pulpit-orator and evangelist,
Rev. Miles Grant, Boston, Mass., writes,
October 7 :
“ ***Touching your wonderful discovery, I take much
pleasure in saying I am delighted with its effects upon
my system. I sent for it that I might know its influence
on a healthy person. I have now used it about three
months, and intend to continue its use during my mortal
life. The treatment produces a general refreshing, in-
vigorating effect: sharpens my appetite, sweetens my
sleep, and makes me feel as though I had a new lease of
life. I have persuaded several of my brethren of the
ministry to send for your Health-Pamphlet, and so far as
I have heard from them they are exceedingly pleased.
One of them said to me a few days ago, ‘1 would not
take $5O for it. It knocks the bottom out of disease.’ I
can say for myself I never spent cash to better advantage
than when I bought your pamphlet —Your brother in
Christ, Miles Grant.”
“ Sydney, June 3,1891.
“ Mr. Oakman. —Dear Sir, —1 have now used for one
month the treatment described in Dr. A. W. Hall’s
health pamphlet, and I certainly feel a wonderful
improvement in health, so great that I cannot describe
how very different my feelings are, for life is now enjoy-
able ; but for nine years past it has often been very
miserable. In the head I have suffered dreadfully, owing
to softening of the brain, and often partial temporary
paralysis of tongue, and other parts; also frequent
severe pains at the heart, with less and less capacity for
work, and other troubles, all of which have ceased to
trouble me except a slight occasional reminder at the
heart. lam exceedingly thankful to the Almighty, and
to Dr. Hall, and yourself, that I am so well, for a month
ago I felt as if some dreadful climax was near.—Yours
truly, Susan E. Hawkins, 58 Henry-street, Leichhardt,
N.S.W.”
“ Glenburn Public School, Wiseman’s Creek,
“ August 14,1891.
“J. C. Oakman. Dear Sir, —I have very much pleasure in
testifyingto the efficiency of Dr. Hall’s hygienic treatment.
I have been a sufferer from indigestion and constipation
in its worst forms for the last eight years, and during
that time I have consulted four (4) medical practitioners
of great skill, but have received very little relief. I have
used a terrible lot of pills and patent medicines. At first
they used to give me a certain amount of relief, but for
six months before using Dr. Hall’s remedy they were quite
useless. For three months before using the hygienic
treatment I suffered terrible pain in my stomach and
bowels, especially at night. I could not sleep but very
little, and had frightful dreams. Mrs. MTnnes had to put
mustard plasters and hot flannels across my stomach
before I could get any relief. I have been using the
hygienic treatment for five weeks, and thank God it has
given me great relief. Since I have started to use it I
have not felt any pain, and can sleep quite sound every
night. I have not felt the slightest touch of indigestion
since, and can eat three hearty, good meals every day.
Everybody says how well I begin to look. My wife and
daughter also use it with good results. I have not the
slightest doubt but that it will cure diseases of the
stomach, liver, kidney, and bowels.—Faithfully yours,
(Signed) EWAN MTNNES (M.M.), Teacher.

THIS eminent Specialist, Founder and Chief Surgeon of the long ; established and favourably^
known Dispensary that now bears his name, received his medical education m the leading Qr
colleges and hospitals of Europe. He has devoted a lifetime to the study of
PRIVATE, NERVOUS AND SKIN DISEASES.
He has by profound research thoroughly investigated their origin, traced their deadly sources anddnsidi-
ous dissemLatkin and ascertained the surest and safest methods by which they may be eracbcat <l.
With these widely-recognised qualifications, combined with unswerving faithfulness to his patients, tic
has*during his maetkf, extending over FORTY YEARS, attained a well-deserved pre-eminence in
their treatment. ‘ His practice embraces diseases which probably cause more unhappiness than any other

TO SEND
For Remedies necessary forthecnre of NERVOUS DEBILITY.
Should you require medical treatment, as procrastination is
sometimes dangerous, it would be advisable for you to sit down
quietly in your chamber and write to the doctor, detailing every
experienced symptom. He will on receipt of such a letter, write
you, promptly and courteously, a candid and straightforward
opinion of your case. If you do not think you understand the
case, send for his famous medical work, the price of which is
but sixpence; enclosed in the volume will be found a list of
carefully-prepared questions, which will, in all probability,
assist you materially in describing your ailment. Dr. Richai’ds
uses nothing but the purest remedies, and never prescribes
mercury under any circumstances. The moment letters are
carefully perused and answered they are destroyed by fire, and
patients may rest assured that their cases will remain a secret
between the doctor and themselves. Dr. Richards has success-
fully treated nearly 25,000 cases since coming to Australia, and
has permission from at ’east 10,000 persons to show their written
evidence of his success All communications should be addressed
