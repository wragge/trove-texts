MINSTREL OF THE GOLDFIELDS
Hugh Anderson’s The Colonial
Minstrel (Cheshire) is so amateurish a
biography and so awkward a piece of
writing that perhaps the best way to
have published it would have been in
a shortened and compacted form for
a limited audience, like the excellent
little monographs he has produced on
some of the old bush songs. On the
other hand he has so much fascinating
material in it, both of national interest
to Australia and New Zealand and of
local interest to such places as Bendigo,
Ballarat, Hobart, Launceston, Christ-
church and Dunedin, that anybody
who reads the book will find it well
worth while.
His hero, Charles Thatcher, who
wrote and sang topical songs of the
goldfields, some of which passed into
popular usage and became “folklore,”
is, in fact, a character at once so
important in minor Australian literary
history and so entertaining in his own
right that it is with reluctance that
one offers any criticism of this devoted
piece of research. But it must be said
that it is a great pity that Anderson
does not quote his authorities for
many of his assertions, that he is not
clearer in his time-sequences, and that
his prose does not run more fluently.
He has the most curious way of pre-
senting “facts” for which there is no
stated authority and which in any case,
even if they are true, are almost mean-
ingless. For instance:—
Thatcher during his few days in
Melbourne luckily fell in with a
group of decent men who were bound
for Bendigo. They tramped out
through Flemington towards Digger’s
Rest where they camped for the
night. After a meagre meal they
huddled for a while around their
fire, talking of the experiences they
had undergone in the new country
and of their life in England, now
seemingly lost for ever.
Where did Anderson get this infor-
mation? How does he know the meal
was “meagre”? Is he writing bio-
graphy or a sort of historical fiction?
If it is biography and he has some
secret authority, where in any case
does so flat and hackneyed a para-
graph. used for the ending of a
chapter, get you? There should either
be more about this episode—who the
men were, what the scene and the talk
really were like around that campfire
—or else there should be less: the bare
fact that Thatcher tramped to Bendigo
with some companions.
Where did Anderson get the more-or-
less useless information, for which
surely he must have authority, that
Thatcher and his friends had “three tin
plates.... and two saucepans” when
they set-up camp in Bendigo? And
what on earth does he mean by this
paragraph on one of Thatcher’s adven-
tures in New Zealand?—
As a farewell to Auckland he
failed in attempting to ride up Queen
Street on a horse. “Whatever his
hobby in the satirical line may be,”
said the “New Zealand Herald,”
“his very evidently does not run on
the hobby or any other horse.”
Largely because Thatcher was in
Bendigo instead of Ballarat at the time,
his account of the Eureka Stockade is
confusing; his account of the “un-
savory” Maori Wars, particularly the
war in the Waikato, is shallow and too
facile in its criticism; and even in his
most colorful episode, when Thatcher
ran off from Bendigo with his fellow-
artist Madame Vitelli, it is not made
clear what happened. Did he really
elope with the “fair enchantress,” as
the Bendigo “Advertiser” unkindly
suspected; was he just innocently
escorting her home to her dying hus-
band; or since subsequently he
toured with and married the lady—•
was he indeed escorting her home, but
not altogether in innocence?
Well, never mind. Here is Charles
Thatcher the minstrel; whose songs,
even if they are doggerel to read H
very well when sung on the ? nd
tralian Goldrush Son|s” record iff’
put out by Wattle
a contemporary reviewer 8
“Colonial Songster” perceived, havu
permanent historical value:— a
We cannot but highly estimate
racy sketches like these which i!
part such lively ideas of life , '
manners at the goldfields. In theS®
humorous and clever sketches -S
digger’s life with its peculiarities and
vicissitudes, is happily portrayed to
persons at a distance, and will be
familiar to future generations when
the digger of the days of rushes '
eight-feet claims and rich piles got
out in a few days, will be only
known by tradition.
And here—the first time anybody has
told us his full life-story—is Charles
Thatcher the man: who learned to play
the flute in Brighton; sang and played
in the London taverns that were the
precursors of the music-halls; emi-
grated to the goldfields and found
singing more profitable than digging:
was horsewhipped by an ageing actor
named Besnard who said he had
insulted his daughter; was jailed for
two days in Bendigo for subsequently
kicking Besnard’s behind; got into hot-
water again for singing a song entitled
“The Amorous Bank Manager,” which
too closely followed local events: was
barred from the theatre where G. V.
Brooke was playing “The Irish
Attorney,” presumably because Brooke
was afraid he would write a comic song
about the night the actor was so drunk
he couldn’t finish the play; ran away
with Madame Vitelli, whose husband
had been a choirmaster at Windsor:
married Madame, took her to New
Zealand, sang in the immense circular
bar of Dunedin’s Commercial Hole
and was turned-out of the House ot
Parliament in Wellington, whose
members also feared his ridicule.
In his later years, when he m j
returned to England, Thatcher became ,
a dealer in Oriental curios; and i
in Shanghai of cholera. He is a
well worth a full-scale biography- |
Hugh Anderson’s book is best rega
as a most useful first step w
direction. I
DOTTEREL
[FROM A SERIES]
Wild and impermanent
as the sea-foam blown,
the dotterel keeps its distance
and runs alone.
Bare beach, salt wind,
its loved solitude,
hold all that it asks
of shelter and food.
I saw its single egg
dropped on the sand,
with neither straw nor wall
to warm or defend;
and the new-hatched chick,
like a thistle’s pale down,
fled and crouched quiet
as sand or as stone.
Water s edge, kind’s edge,
and edge of the air—
the dotterel chooses
to live nowhere.
It runs, but not in fear;
and its thin high call
is like a far bugle
that troubles the soul.

"BACK TO Mt. MORGAN"
/"''OASTAL Central Queensland last
week was busy celebrating its
“Back to Mount Morgan Week,” a
festival which has a significance not
only for the town itself, with its great
and apparently eternal mine, but for
the whole of the State as an example
of what enterprise and modern equip-
ment can do —both in the application
of large-scale techniques and the
management of industrial relationships.
The history of the old Mount Morgan
Company was a tale of a strange mix-
ture of prodigality and improvisation.
It began with the discovery of what
looked like a mine of gold rather than
a gold-mine. The problems
originally to be those of navvying for
lumps of gold rather than of extraction.
When, after a very few years, yields
began to constrict to levels which
would have been considered rich in any
quartz-mine, the directors seemed to re-
gard the change as a somewhat unkind
trick played on them by an ungrateful
Providence, and it was some little time
before they began, of sheer necessity, to
face facts and realise that they had a
long-term low-grade project on hand
which required the application of
originality, strict economy and
ingenuity, if it was to succeed. Even
when new methods of treatment, largely
through the efforts of an unusually
excellent technical staff headed by the
late “Captain” G. A. Richard, had per-
fected the chlorination-process to the
point of making payable the treatment
of its complex ore yielding three and
four dwts., the company took no
account of the fact that its ore was
also rich in copper.
The copper ran completely to waste
until the 1903 drought, when unem-
ployed miners began to leach it out
of the mine water-flow in sluices made
of discarded kerosene-cases filled with
burned jam-tins.
When the company began to produce
copper in 1904, after the terrible experi-
ence of the drought of 1901-3, the shaft
organisation of the mine, an under-
ground system feeding from levels
down to 1050 ft. from the peak of the
now non-existent mountain, proved
inadequate to handle the new ore and
was replaced by an inclined shaft.
Four years later the medium-grade
copper-ore reserves were estimated at
only 1,700,000 tons, showing an aver-
age of 3 per cent, copper and 2.5 dwt.
gold per ton. And before the outbreak
of World War I a famous geologist
placed the ore-bottom, it would seem
erroneously, at a fault at the Linda
level.
The early attitudes of the company
to mining and extraction were
paralleled by its attitudes to perman-
ent water-supply and labor. Until the
1901-3 drought, when it was forced to
bring water by train for a long distance,
it operated with comparatively small
dams which did not stand up to the
strain when the test came.
The labor force, mostly immigrant
and living in its own enclaves, with
dozens of families from the same
British neighborhoods, it regarded as
temporary and migrant like that of
many other Australian fields, and
therefore without the need of perman-
ent amenities, or even permanent
homes.
It thus came about that the outlook
of the owners was in no way linked
with that of the highly adventurous
population, a great proportion of which
accepted as natural the view that they
were British rather than Australian.
The vivid community spirit of the town
had no connection with that of the
mine.
It was no wonder that between 1900
and 1927 the great mining town,
despite efforts in the last years to
produce a proper survey of resources
and technical excellence in mining and
extraction, sank from a thriving com-
munity of about 10,000 to the point
at which, in a welter of industrial strife,
each side blaming the other, Mt.
Morgan ceased to produce, after having
treated in 44 years 8,714,265 tons of
ore for 5,345,0000 z. of gold and 140,000
tons of copper. In the last few years
of its existence it also mined large
quantities of flux and fuel for its own
use.
'T'HE hero of the resurrection of the
mine—and in the heart of the
depression at that—was A. A. Boyd,
general-manager when it was closed,
who preached the doctrine of open-cut
mining in the face of the almost con-
temptuous opposition of American
experts.
With the backing of experienced Aus-
tralian mining men, of whom the
sturdiest backer was Malcolm Newman,
now chairman, whose connection with
the mine dates back to 1908, the ven-
ture was resuscitated in a new atmos-
phere which assumed both the
ence of goldmining i n the 2 man '
community of interest between th?
and town as axiomatic. It Wa

"WITH MY IDEA WE'D ALWAYS HAVE UNANIMITY."


PLAIN ENGLISH
Not Enough
The talk and manoeuvre at the United
Nations has been in strong contrast to
the co-operative and constructive discus-
sions of the conference of the Inter-
national Monetary Fund at Washington
presided over by Harold Holt. There the
procedure has called for clipped ten-
minute speeches and quick decisions,
marked by amicable compromise.
At the United Nations shouting, posing
photographs on roofs, whirling-dervish
processions round the “cocktail-circuit”
and a- renowned toper quaffing gallons
of orange-juice have been items in the
most rowdy show on earth.
The one difference in ingredients which
produced the contrast is the absence from
Washington of the Communist bloc. It
is a catalyst of noise and threat, intro-
duction of which immediately reduces
debate to a mess of futile recrimination.
All the speeches of the Western leaders
at U.N. have been, if resistant to
Khrushchev’s blustering charges, con-
structive and directed towards the estab-
lishment of a conciliatory atmosphere
and negotiation for disarmament.
Oratorically, and in terms of persuasion,
Mr. Menzies’s effort was one of the best
of them.
But Khrushchev, so far from being
ready to listen to the arguments of what
everybody knew would be the summing-
up of the views of the British Common-
wealth, treated it with studied and deliber-
ate contempt by not even attending to
hear it delivered.
The resolution moved by Indian Prime
Minister Nehru and his collection of
fellow-traveller nations proved the old
saying that who sups with the devil must
use a long spoon. All those behind the
resolution Tito, Soekarno, Nasser,
Nkrumah—having drunk Moscow’s beer
are in the family, tied in some degree to
Communist economies, and Nehru him-
self is evidently actuated by fear, after
the evidence of his danger inherent in
recent Tibetan history. The “five-
neutral - Powers” resolution to bring
Eisenhower and Khrushchev into a
purely bilateral negotiation had the ear-
marks of Soviet inspiration, directed to-
wards discovering the trends among the
S. American and African nations.
The natural inference from Nehru’s
behavior and anger at Menzies’s speech
is that he was feeling the humiliation
natural to the owner of a troubled
conscience and that the Australian Prime
Minister’s clarification of issues and
motives showed him up in a shameful
light and put his world influence in proper
perspective. It also undoubtedly killed
the Russo-Indian plan.
Khrushchev and his followers came to
the Assembly to hold a criminal trial of
the United States before the world court
of appeal. That they failed to produce
evidence, much less secure a conviction,
and have themselves been placed on trial
as aggressors and breakers of inter-
national law should be patent to all.
How far the defeat of the Communist
bloc is a good or bad thing only events
will tell. It is highly unpalatable to any
dictator to be publicly humiliated.
Khrushchev’s natural reaction could be
to show his own people that the wicked
capitalists of decaying imperialism can-
not trifle with Big Brother.
Whatever happens, it is clear that U.N.
has ceased to have any value as an instru-
ment of international conciliation. The
acid De Gaulle, who very sensibly stayed
away from it, has summed-up its position
very accurately.
The U.N. has, he says, “degenerated
into a kind of scandal, with intemperate
speeches, absurd outbiddings and bellicose
dangers.”
His announcement that France, which
helped to found it, refuses to be
swallowed by its own Frankenstein
monster is the first breakaway of material
from the crumbling structure which is
ripe for replacement by something more
sane and workable, free of Communist
obstruction and sabotage.
In any case, following Khrushchev’s
later utterances, it seems that he himself
will have to wreck the shaky body, or lose
face with all the backward nations he is
seeking to lure behind the Iron Curtain,
since he has made it clear that if the
U.N. does not allow him to dictate its
structure he must replace it by a body
of his own using force to gain its ends.
On that basis, his bluff could well be
called and the U.S.S.R. expelled as having
repudiated the U.N. Charter.
Keeping It Quiet
Experiments at the Melbourne Morgue
have shown that blood-alcohol tests are
inaccurate. This highly important news
has been divulged not in the form of
a Government announcement, but in
cross-examination in a case which Law
Courts pressmen fortunately were
reporting.
Dr. James H. McNamara, a Govern-
ment pathologist, said the previous
medical assumption that if blood from
the heart gave a certain blood-alcohol
percentage, blood-samples from other
parts of the body would give the same,
was not correct; in fact, four samples
from different parts of a body had given
four results.
In the case before the court, the sample
of blood from the victim, a woman
weighing six stone, showed 0.373 per
cent, alcohol. This was equivalent to
that shown by an 11-stone man after
drinking 24 seven-ounce beers. Sholl, J.,
who was hearing the case, asked if the
matter had been brought under the
notice of other authorities, and the
pathologist replied that apparently it had
not.
Medicine is not an exact science, but
some medical conclusions, especially
such apparently simple tests as alcoholic-
blood counts have been accepted as
gospel in Victorian courts and would
have continued to be so accepted if this
disclosure had not been made.
It would be interesting to hear from
official quarters how long this w,
tion has been sat upon. nfori ®
Education Pressure -q roimc
[From “Collins-street”] $
Although Victorians are the hu
taxed Australians and State BudgS?
become progressively burdened
ever-mounting votes for education?
pressure-groups associated with’t
education become ever more
and insatiable. VOcifero « j
Themost loquacious of these is the
State School Committees and Coun
Association. A fortnight ago at its annua
conference its president, John Woo
claimed that the immediate prospect io
education, as far as buildings were con-
cerned, was worse than four years ago,
Among other complaints were motions
asking the State Government to set-up
(yet another) “expert committee” to
improve and speed-up school-construction
methods, deploring the “policy 0 f
neglect” in maintaining State schools and
residences, drawing attention to tie
inadequacy of heating in schools and
calling on the Public Works Department
to “insist” that its school contracts be
finished on time.
The arresting facts are that the educa-
tion vote in the current Budget is 151
million, up £6.8 million, and more tlan
double that of 1954-55. In that time
the number of pupils has risen 40 p.c,
and expenditure by 113 p.c. Last year i
£lO.B million was spent on capital and/
maintenance work ; this year it will be
more than £ll million. More than 1000
new classrooms were constructed and
currently 13 new high-schools are either
building or about to begin.
Despite the fact that the provision of
free education has completely dominated
each of the Bolte Budgets to an extent
hardly contemplated by either of its
Labor- or Country-party predecessors in
Parliament, State Ministers take a most
submissive tone in dealing with the
beneficiaries.
Discussing the recommendations by J
committee of six educationists, Edu-
cation Minister Bloomfield, a m° rc
forthright fellow until he becam
bowed with the weight of his por-
folio, told the conference the recom-
mendations would be taken as tar
they could. “I hope you will not expea

- Defence Needs
[From NX 22]
L in New South Wales being,

z t Sydney, on a voluntary basis, its
c ss depends largely on the outlook
participation of the public. Ignor-
JL 0 f what is being done now, and
y can be done in a disaster, is the
lin cause of public apathy. It can also
u use( j as an excuse for those who are
unwilling to spare some of their leisure
for such matters.
It is not generally known that civil
defence means organising facilities
already available and training citizens to
hip others and themselves in any
faster. This, of course, includes attack
by high-explosive or nuclear weapons.
Stress is laid on nuclear weapons so that
training may be directed towards the
greatest possible threat, but this
engenders a pessimistic outlook in those
who don’t realise all that can be done
to mitigate suffering and damage in such
j a disaster. Such people think only of
tie few miles of complete destruction
; aid forget the firefighting and rescue
work that can be carried-out to assist
| tie tens of thousands who might be

\ They don’t know, for example, that in
I an area such as North Sydney 30,000
' people could be evacuated from the
target-area immediately a nuclear war
started on the other side of the world.
The necessity for such an organisation
iswell recognised and, in fact, already
wll organised in country areas subject
to threats from fire and flood. What of

little money is required to carry-out the
director’s plans. What is required is the
realisation that civil-defence activity is
a measure of the spirit of the people ;
willingness to help others must be
expressed by physical co-operation in
this organisation without delay. “Too
late” in civil defence is an indictment on
Australia’s morality and might spell
suicide. “Too early” really means that the
desire to help others in distress has been
proved and much knowledge dis-
seminated which might help to lessen
the toll of injury in normal civil life.

as a tactician and toughness when
engaged in kicking his own country and
leaving it wide-open to Communist
aggression.
On the threshold of events in Paris
last May the soft-headed might have
been pardoned if they were prepared to
take the Soviet dictators at their face-
value as avatars of peace on earth. Only
the stone-deaf could feel the same way
about them after their behavior at Paris
and in the U.N. Assembly.
Yet at a crisis in which Khrushchev
was engaged in bullying the world into
submission to the Communist bloc and
making it plain that U.N. was no further
use unless subordinated to the purposes
of the Communist world-revolution, the
British Labor party under Mr. Cousins’s
steering, voted that Britain should
renounce nuclear-defence with other
nations of the West and, in effect, leave
the field of nuclear armament to Russia.
This, as a gesture of peace!
The facts that are being adduced that
the “last word rests with the Parliamen-
tary Labor party” and the local bodies
that choose candidates, and that Mr.
Gaitskell is “full of fight” and almost
ready to become another Churchill
doesn’t much mitigate the hard fact that
a majority vote of the Labor unions of
the U.K., led by the heavy-industry and
transport unions which are the very core
of the national-defence system, have gone
pacifist and hoisted the white flag of
surrender.
The effect on U.S. co-operation will be
profound and disastrous, and in Moscow
the decision will be read as the achieve-
ment of Communist agents and proof
of their power to thwart the British
Government in the interests of revolu-
tion. V
Fortunately, however, these effects
should be only transitional. The ulti-
mate result could be the destruction of
the Labor party and a powerful resur-
gence of the Liberals.
As in Australia, Labor can scarcely
survive long on its staple diet of Leftism.
Weekend Crime
(From “New Zeal’’]
Long weekends with ample money to
spend continue to produce crops of crime,
mostly juvenile, in the Land of Social
Security. Some gleanings from the
Wellington “Post” of Monday, October
3: Double-column heading from Christ-
church : “Hooligans Terrorise Residents
on Three Mornings” (shattered windows,
gates and signs smashed, doors battered
by gangs of young people). From
Rotorua: Householder struck on the
head by midnight intruder who escaped.
Wellington: 19-year-old youth remanded
for an assault witnessed by ten other
youths. Lower Hutt: Three schoolboys
plead guilty to converting cars to the
value of over £ll,OOO in past six months.
Wellington (another d.-c. heading):
“Deaf Mute Viciously Attacked at Rail-
way Station” (victim now in hospital
minus his wallet of £63 ; states his assail-
ants were Maoris). Wellington again: A
splash heading, “Bag Snatcher Caught
After Chase Through City” (Maori, aged
20, admitted bashing and robbing 15-
year-old girl in centre of the city). At
Paraparaumu youngsters placed wood and
rocks on the railway-line, the obstruction
being cleared by a policeman a split-
second before a railcar charged down at
60 m.p.h. From Auckland: “Son of
M.P. Victim of Brutal Assault” (three
youths dragged him from his car, left
him bleeding on the footpath and stole
the car). From Masterton: Gang of
fifteen youths armed with bottles and
flagons disturbed a skating-rink. When
one of them was arrested his mates fol-
lowed, threatening, to the police-station.
After the Hastings business New
Zealanders did not seem over-concerned,
the outbreaks being sporadic and lacking
in concentration. But this harvest of one
weekend should stir them. By way of
variety to the above chronicle the Minis-
ter of Justice announced that in view of
the acquittal of a truck-driver found in
possession of marihuana the Dangerous
Drugs Act might be stiffened. This was
followed by a Ministerial statement that
the Government is planning heavier
penalties for disorderly behavior.

“Albert Edward”: The store wanted
to put-off a few employees, and as there
had been some complaints of lack of
attention they sent a trained woman to
buy clothes and report on the staff. The
first young woman who served her went
to no end of trouble, showing at least
15 frocks, and was still polite when the
customer wasn’t satisfied. The customer
said she liked a button on a more expen-
ive frock, and would have taken the
cheaper one if it had had the other
button. Without a word, the assistant
cut off the button, and sewed it on the
cheaper frock —the “detective” had to
take and pay for the frock. . . She had
a sudden thought, went back and offered
the assistant a better job. “I love it
here,” said the assistant. “But you
might get into trouble for switching that
button,” urged the “detective.” “Oh,
no!” said the girl. “I’ve decided to
buy the other dress for myself, otherwise
I wouldn't have switched the button.”
The “detective” reported that the loyal
assistant should not only be retained but
offered a better job. Unfortunately for

typewriters. I started with the Eastern
Extension Cable Company in ’O5, later
transferring to the Commonwealth, work-
ing with such speedsters in the Melbourne
office .as Ted Sprague, C. Bingham,
Tommy Roberts, Theo Hewitt. When
you realise that the average speed of
legible handwriting is around 25 words
a minute, five letters representing each
word, while a reasonably-fast sender
could scrape along at a sending-speed of
30 to 35 words a minute, it is obvious
what intense concentration was neces-
sary to receive (and mentally store the
excess words) at a speed faster than one


could write. The gradual adoption of
typewriters for reception eased the strain
considerably. No doubt the reference to
“Whetstone” was a misprint for Wheat-
stone ;as one cynic claimed: “Wheat-
stone was a method of transferring delay
from one end of a line to the other,”
for though the speed of transmission
exceeded 100 words a minute, all tele-
grams received on morse-signalled tapes
had to be copied subsequently. Nowa-
days teletype machines and similar
methods have greatly reduced the operat-
ing-strain, but require far better landlines
and equipment than were available in
my day ; yet I’d hate to see some of the
present-day telegraphists endeavoring to
decipher the weird signals that used to
pass for morse on some of the old
cables and trunk-lines.

self-service and rag-row institutions.

“The marble effigy of Guiderello Guiderilli,
a 15th-century knight of Ravenna, Italy, has
had to be enclosed in a glass casket because
its features were constantly being smeared
with lipstick and were being worn away by

spent his life in stern pursuits, was almost

A parfait he-man knight
Was this once-luckless wight,
Encased in tinplate as he hacked and
skewered ;
No matter how he tried
He couldn’t scratch his hide —
Marauding fleas just had to be endured.
Worse still, he gave his life
Over to ceaseless strife,
A task he deemed a dedicated duty.
He must have been quite dense,
Poor mutt. He'd not the sense
To cash-in on his striking manly beauty.
He might have had a spin
As good as Errol Flynn
If dames, not glojy, he'd have been
pursuing.
They knew not his caress —
Which shows how profitless
Was all his tilting and his derring-
doing!'
He could have made girls swoon
At sight of him, the loon;
Been toasted eagerly in rich, red vino
By fatuous matriarchs
Desiring little larks
With this Renaissance Rudolph
Valentino.
How oft he’s had the grip
On his enmarbled lip —
A buss which must have brought a
swift reaction
Had it been tendered him
In life as a prelim.
To mushy sport. Well, well, some
satisfaction
You’ll get, Guid, as you pass
Behind protective glass.

horse, winning both three-day events
and show-jumping in Australia as well
as being a top-class polocross pony.”
Following their triumph at Babminton
the Australian team competed at the
International Horse Show at White City
in July, coming first with Britain in the
team event of show-jumping, tho teams
agreeing to share the first-prize rather
than jump-off against each other. Then
Neal Lavis, riding Mirrabooka, won the

came what is the supreme test in
the world today of horses’ and
riders’ training, endurance and courage
—the Olympic three-day event. It is
always hot in Rome in August and early
September, and the Games were unlucky
enough to strike the worst heatwave for
10 years, with temperature soaring to
105 deg. F.
Eighteen nations competed in the
three-day event, each team comprising
four horses and riders, allowing one to
be eliminated by accidents. The event
included first the dressage test, then the
two-and-a-half-mile steeplechase over 11
fences. This was followed by the endur-
ance test of 22 miles, which included
14 miles of roads and tracks over diffi-
cult country, and between four and five
miles of cross-country course with 35
of the most difficult fences and obstacles
that a horse can possibly negotiate, and
1000yds. run-in to the finish. Each
individual horse was timed for the whole
distance, and bonus points were allotted
to those completing the course in the
lowest time.
After completing this gruelling test
the horses had to pass veterinary inspec-
tion for soundness before being allowed
to compete in the final event, the show-
jumping of 12 fences.
}
TThe 18 nations included the picked
riders and horses of the world—
the British, Italian, German, Swedish,
Russian, Swiss, Irish and the rest, many
of which based their training on crack
cavalry schools.
The Australians and their horses had
come out of their paddocks into training,
with none of the tradition of these
British and foreign riders. But it was
proved that they were lucky in their
trainer, whose methods were superb.
All the teams completed the dressage
test. But the hard cross-country course
eliminated 12 teams, horses either falling
or refusing at the difficult obstacles and
not completing the course.
No fewer than 12 horses fell at the
31st fence nearing the end of the course,
called the “open-pipes obstacle.” It
consisted of 3ft. drain-pipes jumped end-
on, with a deep drop on the far side
which the horses could see through the
pipes as they approached.
It was at this fence that Bill Roycroft,
on the gallant little Our Solo, riding
magnificently and going faster than any
other competitor, struck the railing on
top of the pipes and came down.
Our Solo’s legs were severely cut and
Roycroft chipped his collarbone and
suffered minor concussion. But he re-
mounted, and rode on to finish the
course. Lavis, on Mirrabooka, and
Brian Crago, on Sabre, completed the
course without loss of penalty-points,
but Sabre came in lame. Morgan did a
fine test, and the day ended with the
Australians earning 26 bonus- points,
while the Swiss came second with 252
mmwi-points.
'T'his put the Australians a long way
-*• in the lead. But with Sabre vetted
out of the final event through lameness,
the anxiety was whether Our Solo would
pass the vets, and if Roycroft would be
fit to ride him.
Then, broadcasting the show-jumping
on the Saturday afternoon, the 8.8. C.
described Morgan, on Salad Days,
entering the ring in his pink coat as the
shadows were lengthening and doing a
perfect round except for dislodging one
brick on the wall, which cost him 10
faults. But he won the gold-medal for
the individual performance.
Lavis came second, riding Mirrabooka,
winning the silver-medal; and finally
Roycroft, out of hospital, riding with
great courage and one hand only, made
a perfect round on the game little Our
Solo to win the gold-medal for the Aus-
tralian team.
Interviewed by the 8.8. C. after the
event, Morgan said that the “open-pipe”
obstacle which had caused disaster and
eliminated so many of the other teams'
was “an unfair and unreasonable fence
to ask a tired horse to jump.” Asked
how the team’s victory was won, he
said that from the time they arrived in
England it had been all “hard work, more
work, training-periods twice a day every
day. And work, work and more work!”
He also said how much Franz Mairin-
gar’s training had gone towards making
the win.
In a final count, the quality which
contributed most to the victory that
ended the 1960 Games —as the press
headlined, “In a blaze of glory for
Australia”—was the courage of horse
and rider.


POLITICAL POINTS
Nehru’s attack on Menzies seemed out
of all proportion to the latter’s criti-
cism of his proposal for an Eisenhower-
Khrushchev meeting. It was also in
violent contrast to the spirit of sweet
compromise so often advocated by Nehru
in international dealings. Admittedly the
P.M.’s amendment was a stalling move,
but at least it was closer to reality than
the Nehru - Nasser - Nkrumah - Tito -
Soekarno proposal. Most people believe
that a four-Power meeting will ultimately
take place, but there was not the slightest
likelihood of a meeting between Eisen-
hower and Khrushchev, and even less
likelihood of any useful agreement being
reached if a meeting did take place in the
closing weeks of the U.S. election cam-
paign.
By withdrawing his motion after an
Argentine amendment had suggested an
appeal to the U.S. and Soviet Govern-
ments rather than Eisenhower and
Khrushchev, Nehru exposed the weakness
of his proposal. After all, U.N. is sup-
posed to work through Governments, not
through Heads of State.

No surprises were provided by the two
N.S.W. Assembly by-elections on Satur-
day. The Country party retained Temora
and Labor held Kurri. At the last general
election the late S. D. Dickson was
returned unopposed for Temora and in
1956 his majority was 4490. On Satur-
day his Country-party successor, J. H.
Taylor, held a lead of a little more than
half that figure. The improvement in the
Labor vote was not as great as this might
suggest. There were about 1300 fewer
voters on the roll this year than in 1956.
Totals: J. H. Taylor ’(C.P.) 7835; L.
R. Hoad (A.L.P.), 5546.
In Kurri, where K. G. Booth, son of
the late member, was the Labor candi-
date, the contest was almost a walkover.
Scores, Booth (A.L.P.), 16,609; J. R.
Clark (Ind.), 1425.

'T'he tone of much comment on the
Nehru motion stressed the high moral
purpose of the five proposers. The
Indian Prime Minister’s four partners in
the move were Nasser, Nkrumah, Tito

As a result of last week’s referendum
South Africa will probably become a
republic next year. At the polls 849,958
persons voted for a republic and 775,978
opposed it. The majority, 73,980, seems
rather a small one on which to base
such a momentous move, but the
Nationalist party took care of that a few
years ago, by getting rid of the clause
in the Constitution which required a two-
thirds majority for such a change. Before
it managed to do that it had to swamp
the Senate with republican nominees ;
abolish appeals to the Privy Council and
stack the Supreme Court. After that all
was plain sailing.
Oom Verwoerd apparently intends to
take advantage of that peculiar piece of
legerdemain (devised at first for the
satisfaction of India and since made use
of by Ghana and others) by which the
Queen is dethroned and then acknow-
ledged as Head of the Commonwealth
—a position she could not hold if she
were not Queen.
By old-fashioned standards this habit/
of rushing out through the front door
and then seeking admittance through the
side window would seem rather absurd,
but on the precedents already estab-
lished there seems no real ground for
refusing a South African republic mem-
bership of the Commonwealth. The
idea that Ghana, for example, should
be permitted to veto an application which
had the support of the original members
is ludicrous.

Tf the Communist countries don’t get
“equality with the Western countries
and the neutralists” in the administration
of U.N., says Khrushchev, “we will up-
hold our interests outside the U.N. by
relying on our own force.” This remark
may be a trifle puzzling to those who
were under the impression that the Soviet
had long been looking after its interests
by relying on its own force. What Mr.
K. really meant by equality was shown
by another remark in the course of the
same interview, when he said he would
not agree to Hammarskjold continu-
ing as Secretary-General of U.N. even

of food-production had a bigger advan-

margin, so the trend is ominous. Unless
something is done pretty soon to raise
the former and lower the latter an explo-

Calling at The Bulletin office last

Albert Sherman mentioned in conversa-

fetched 560gns. at auction, said to be
the highest price paid in Australia for

this year; others were auctioned at
similar prices—though not quite so high
—in February and March. Hailing origi-
nally from' Truro, Cornwall (Eng.), he
was a teacher at the Technical College
there when at the start of War I he joined
the Royal Navy for the duration. In
1920 he came to Sydney, became a mem-
ber of the Royal Art Society of N.S.W.,
and began showing his pictures almost
straight away. Since then, from his studio
at Earlwood, he has been painting flowers
and landscapes, working chiefly nowa-
days on commission.

duction of which made its debut in
Sydney last week—and during War II
they took it on tour to the fighting forces

of Noel Coward plays during his Aus-

by a North American tour with Gielgud
and another London season before
Broadway got its hooks into him, and
he’s been there ever since, except for a
visit to Sydney for Coward’s “Private

UNCLE PUMPKIN
[From a series for children ]
Miss Strawberry’s uncle Mr. Pumpkin
Is a fat untidy lazy bumpkin.
He sits all day in a rocking-chair
And says to Miss Strawberry “Here, my
dear,
Bring me lots and lots of beer.
In this hot weather I must drink
Lest my clothes begin to shrink.
Then again in fear I drink
That I myself begin to shrink;
And when I’ve knocked two dozen off,
Bring me more that I may quaff;
When these are gone, please do not jibe,
Bring me more I may imbibe.
Then bring me whisky neat — don’t
drown it;
Give me the bottle —let me down it.
Then if wine you will allow
Bring me some that I may swallow.
Then I’d like some beer again
Which glass by glass I’ll slowly drain,
While my happy underlip '
Stretches out for every sip.
You see, I fear unless l drink
The very bones of me will shrink.”
Miss Strawberry, angry, says “I think
I’d rather you were wholly shrunken
Than sitting there so fat and drunken.”

“Fair Cow”: Butler Cronin’s umbrage

Twas early Monday morning, and
Charles, along with a bunch of stockmen,
entered the horse-yard at sunrise to catch
his day’s mount. Charlie had been on a
month’s bender in town.; this was his
first morning on a new station, where the
boss had the reputation of a stuck-up
blankard. Charlie’s perishing thirst
already had him in two minds about
snatching-it and heading back to the
grog. The boss on his fine thoroughbred
led the team from the yard without say-
ing “Good-day,” “Kiss me foot,” or
anything. This was the last straw to
Charlie. Slipping off his mount he
crouched on hand and knees in the dust,
made tail-wagging motions with his free
arm and emitted howls which rivalled a
dog baying at the moon. The boss
swung round. “What’e ,

THE STORY OF ELECTROLYTIC ZINC
[Another chapter from “The Fabulous Hill,” an official story of
the Broken Hill mining enterprises.]
Almost a third of the elec-
tricity generated in the
State of Tasmania flows into
one big £20,000,000 plant at
Risdon, on the banks of the
Derwent River.
Most of this power is con-
sumed in one room —a 600 ft.
expanse of cells where a river
of crystal-clear zinc-sulphate
solution meets a river of hydro-
electric power and is changed
by electrolysis into sheets of
pure, silvery zinc.
There are 648 cells arranged
in cascades consuming power at
the rate of more than 65,000
h.p. continuously, while the
flow of electrolyte is more than
a million gallons a day.
Risdon is the world’s third-
largest producer of electro-
lytic zinc, and, with a capacity
of 120,000 tons a year, supplies
all Australia’s requirements, as
well as portion of the needs of
United Kingdom, India and
other Asian countries, United
States and New Zealand.
Australia’s greatest use of
zinc is for galvanised-iron, the
favorite roofing-material of the
outback, and the source of
windmills, water-tanks, fencing-
wire, piping and a thousand
necessities for the farmer and
for industry. Both in Austra-
lia and overseas there is an
ever-increasing use of zinc in
die - castings for motor - cars,
electrical appliances and
machinery.
Today, only Trail, in British
Columbia, and Great Falls,
Montana, outstrip Risdon in
capacity and output of electro-
lytic zinc.
concentrate, the raw
material treated at Risdon,
contains three tons of sulphur
for each five tons of zinc.
Huge acid-plants convert this
sulphur into vast quantities of
sulphuric acid, which in turn
is used in making fertilisers.
In addition to supplying Tas-
mania with sulphuric acid, Ris-
don provides fertiliser for the
whole of the State in the form
of superphosphate produced
by mixing acid with phosphate
rock.
An ultra-modern plant pro-
duces ammonia to combine
with sulphuric acid and form
sulphate of ammonia. The
plant has a capacity of 60,000
tons a year, enough to provide
more than half of Australia’s
requirements. Most of it goes
to Queensland to fertilise the
sugarcane crop.
For centuries commercial
zinc has been obtained by
smelting—the distillation of the
metal from its oxide using coal
—and this is how the first small
tonnages were produced from
the Broken Hill ore, most of
which was shipped abroad in
the form of concentrates.
But in the early days of
Broken Hill, before the flota-
tion process was developed so
that lead-rich and zinc-rich
particles could be floated off
separately, zinc was little more
than a troublesome impurity,
and millions of tons of zinc-
rich residue were left to domin-
ate the Broken Hill landscape.
In 1905 Amalgamated Zinc (de
Bavay), Ltd., was formed to
treat the dumps, and over the
next half-century the flotation
process has been so developed
that recoveries of 90 p.c. are
achieved in the concentration-
plants at the mines.
'T'he war of 1914-18 produced
a series of circumstances
which led to the formation of
the Electrolytic Zinc Company
of Australasia, Ltd., and the
building of its great plant at
Risdon. Although high-quality
zinc was needed for the manu-
facture of munitions in greater
quantities than ever before, the
Broken Hill mines, cut off from
the formerly used smelters in
Europe, were finding it difficult
to sell concentrates overseas.
Meanwhile, in Canada and
the U.S.A. the first commercial
plants for the manufacture of
electrolytic zinc were w
up by the Consolidafedlr
mg and Smelting Com
Canada at Trail
Columbia, and by f he B ? sl

large quantities. On the cut,
hand, cheap power is essential
it the electrolytic process is to
compete with zinc produced bv
distillation. The Tasmanian
Government could supply
power for a fraction of a penny
a unit (Kwh.).
So the zinc concentrates
from Broken Hill and the high-
land water-power of Tasmania
were brought together at Ris-
don, on the beautiful Derwent
River, with its excellent deep-
water shipping facilities. It is
just five miles from Hobart,
Tasmania’s picturesque capital,
In 1917 the Broken Hill com-
panies provided the money for
a pilot-plant, which began pro-
ducing only a few tons a day,

A Deep Oil-test in Q’land
[From “H. Vona”]
An important oil-test will
shortly get under way in
s.-e. Queensland. This will be
the deep wildcat drilled by
Union Oil Development Cor-
poration at Cabawin, in the
Tara area. The location is
aboyt 90 miles s.-e. of Roma
in what is known as the Surat
Basin portion of the Great
Artesian Basin.
The proposed drilling is an
excellent example of what can
be done in promoting and
financing genuine oil - search
activities. Australian Oil and
Gas Corporation had some
strong geological ideas concern-
ing the Surat Basin and backed
them by blocking-out the entire
area with one huge authority-
to-prospect in Queensland and
four smaller ones in adjoining
N.S.W. The total area is just
under 60,000 square-miles.
The co. carried out prelimin-
ary geophysical work and com-
piled geological data. The pic-
ture it came up with was far
from complete, and certainly
not conclusive enough to war-
rant drilling. Still, it indicated
a petroleum potential, and this
was far better than what could
be said for many other areas of
Australia.
It was also clear to A.O.G.
that the chances of its own
resources lasting long enough
to pinpoint an oilfield in those
60,000 sq.-miles were poor in-
deed -
The co. went looking for an
American partner of repute,
Union Oil of California, a
concern which showed a profit
of over thirteen-million dollars
in the first half of 1960, became
interested. It sent a senior
geologist to Australia, and,
after several months of investi-
gation, he recommended that
Union step into the picture,

other California firm (Kern

The American partners car-
ried out an aggressive explora-
tion programme to select the
first drilling - location. They
initially employed an Austra-
lian geophysical firm to make
an airborne magnetometer
survey. This was to assure
that a thick sedimentary
sequence did in fact exist.
Satisfied with the results of this
work, they then brought in an
American seismic team to do
detailed work in the Tara area
where previous gravity-work
by A.O.G. had indicated an
interestng situation. The results
of the seismic work have appa-
rently been good enough to
warrant the present deep test.
Finally, the American part-
ners have turned to Oil Drill-
ing and Exploration, of Syd-
ney, to bring in their largest
rig for a test which may go to
12,000 ft.
It is quite useless to specu-
late on the presence or absence
of oil in this area. However,
if confidence in the operators is
sought, the above resume cer-
tainly indicates that the entire
operation is in good hands.

Consolidated net earnings
for 1959-60 were equal to 18.9

Both these figures exclude the
undistributed profits of the
Daffodil margarine offshoot, in
which the co. has a one-third

obviously well covered, but
the co. has a record of careful

which are calling for more and

SUNDRY
SHOWS
THE ART OF RUSSELL DRYSDALE
or some mysterious reason
r Russell Drysdale is usually
classed among the “modernists”
in Australian art, as opposed to
whatever the modernists are
supposed to be opposed to ; yet
his technique is sound, his
drawing (allowing for some
stylisation) firmly based on
observation, his pictures have
clear meaning, even of an
anecdotal kind, and in subject-
matter surely the natural way
to regard him is as the succes-
sor to Tom Roberts'in painting
the life and the scenes of the
outback.
If he has taken his impetus
not from Tom Roberts but
from overseas schools of the
day-American Middle West
and the Spanish-Mexican, with
even Stanley Spencer and the
Pre-Raphaelites apparently an
influence in some of the early
paintings—that is exactly what
Tom Roberts himself did ; ex-
cept that he went to France
and the Impressionists for his
pint of departure.
If modernism is abstraction,
which is just about what it has
come to mean in Sydney today,
to one picture in the big
retrospective exhibition of
Male’s works at the N. S.
wales Gallery strikingly illus-
trates his difference from the
moderns: for “Emus in a
.scape,” while in its float-
jf , scra P s °f old iron it has
he abstract values of queer
!. apes Quivering in tension”
ion a pinpoint,
a the same time perfectly
clear and meaningful emus in
a landscape. It speaks to the
mind as well as merely to the
emotions ; it is an observation
or an interpretation of Nature
as well as a game with shapes.
There is not merely paint in
it, but life.
Of course, in its queer stark-
ness, in its obvious debt to the
techniques of abstraction, it
proves that Drysdale is of his
times and, as an artist should,
has moved with the times ; but
it also proves that he is moving
in the tradition of art and has
departed very little from it.
He has, simply, added some-
thing to Tom Roberts.
Whether, as a painter of
outback genre, Drysdale has
Tom Roberts’s subtlety and
suavity of color and modelling,
his sensitivity of observation
and his mastery of composition
on a large scale (which in
“Bailed Up” make it equally
pleasurable to study the horse’s
plum - colored backside, the
grass-trees on the hillside or
the wonderful Australian
casualness of that dramatic
episode), is a question which
it is perhaps not fair to ask.
If it is asked—and Roberts
should easily come out on top
—it should not be in disparage-
ment of Drysdale but only so
that we may get a proper valua-
tion between the best that has
been done here in the past and
the best that is being done
today.
But the aims are so different
that perhaps the question really
should not arise: Drysdale is
concerned with harsher coun-
try, starker contrasts of color,
more battered and worn-down
types of people, more “monu-
mental” outcroppings of rocks,
or buildings, or men. He has
his own distinctive world ; he
depicts it with force and feel-
ing, fulfilling his own aims with
remarkable success ; and there
can be little doubt about his
pre-eminence in his chosen field
among the painters of today.
Though Heysen was before
him in the desert and Minns
and Murch in painting the
aborigines, Drysdale is prob-
ably the originating force in
the whole outback movement
which has sprung up in recent
years—Nolan, Clifton Pugh,
latterly Albert Tucker—and he
has a solidity which the
others, however intriguing in
their various ways, have not
yet matched. Both in subject-
matter and in technical re-
sources he is a limited painter,
so far as we can tell; but where
he stands, he stands firmly.
The present exhibition dis-
plays his talent to full advan-
tage. At least on the opening
day, when Sydney turned-on
spring sunshine, the lighting—
as well as the realisation of
how much wit and human
warmth underlie many of the
portrait - studies helped to
dispel that impression of undue
sombreness which isolated
works in dingier galleries have
sometimes conveyed. The
spaciousness of the courts gives
the rocks and the light in such
pieces as “Desert Landscape”
a chance to achieve their full
dramatic effect. The hanging
has been excellently arranged
to illustrate, more-or-less in
chronological sequence, the
development of his work, so
that, after the first pictures of
lean men and lean trees and
lean dogs with their strong
Middle West influence, some-
times hardly more than maga-
zine illustration, one can see
an ever-growing certitude of
both technique and Australian
feeling showing in his rocks,
his distances, his inimitable
country towns, his outback
types and, most recently, in his
aborigines half-lost in the red
haze of desert and Dreamtime.
A few old favorites are
missing, notably “Joe’s Gar-
den of Dreams,” which is in
the Philippines, and “War
Memorial,” which is in the
Tate, but on the whole it is
a most comprehensive display.
What it chiefly demonstrates—•
apart from the excellence of
so many of the individual
paintings (the children dancing
in the desert; the nun super-
vising the basketball-game ; the
fat Greek waiting for custo-
mers ; the haunting rabbiter’s
wife; the station blacks Guri-
ously grouped as in a photo-
graph)—is the massiveness of
Drysdale’s achievement as a
whole. Here are two big
courts of the gallery completely
filled with his paintings ; and,
if we had a policy of concen-
trating on worth-while Austra-
lian work, as we should, half
of them could well stay there
permanently.

Other Exhibitions
Other Sydney exhibitions for
the week are really too numer-
ous to mention. But —briefly
—they comprise John Olsen’s
abstracts at the Clune Galleries,
a kind of finger-painting in
which the occasional richness
and intricacy of color and
design hardly compensate for
the elementary technical means
employed; the Christian-art
competition at Farmer’s, an
indifferent lot of work in which
the best paintings are semi-
abstracts by Peascod, Gleg-
horn, Hughes and Coburn, and
Kim Yong Kil’s queer contri-
bution from Korea ; “Austra-
lian Life” in the old “Herald”
building, now the Bank of
N. S. Wales, where there are
two superb Hilders, a decora-
tive Finey, and some lively
works by Nolan, Pugh, Meere,
Friend and Plate; and “Old

Stage and Music
Claremont Quartet
Any handbook on music is
likely to parrot the perfectly
sound idea that the six string-
quartets from Beethoven’s last
years are the finest of his
achievements. This being so,
it has to be admitted that they
are scarcely ever heard because
there is no one to play them —
in this part of the world at
least. There are subsidised
orchestras, but, save for the
bold Queensland experiment
some years ago, there are no
permanent quartets.
So it was an event of the
first order when the Claremont
Quartet of New York played
the great “Thanksgiving” Quar-
tet in Brisbane at the beginning
of a Musica Viva tour.
These men have played to-
gether long enough to develop
the cohesiveness of tone that
marks the professional quartet.
Here they had to play music at
times profoundly serious yet
with its moments of gayness,
and even the droll squeal of a
bagpipe tone.
The slow movement is a
thanksgiving after recovery
from a serious illness. It is
Beethoven at his most sublime,
its unbearable tensions broken
twice by interludes that are
strongly rhythmical and physic-
ally infectious in the manner
of a dance-tune. The ,
the music' was projected °
cessfully i„ a perL’*™ U
was tar and away one of *
best things of theVason ,h '
A rather monotonous earlv
quartet by Schubert opened®

to one of the most startl
pieces in the repertoire. T h
was a “Filigree Setting f or
String Quartet” by Mel Powell
who teaches at Yale University
Jt is spiky, angular music that
swishes quickly from a brief
moment of beauty to sounds
not unlike the splintering of a
pane of glass.
All this was punctuated with
percussive tappings and bang,
ings on the sides of the instru-
ments that deserved either boos
or cheers instead of the polite
reception that followed the last
thud.
One of Stravinsky’s two
pieces for quartet, “Concer-
tino,” was lean and tense and
energetic without strongly de-
fined themes. It added spice to
a programme that blew the cob-
webs off anyone’s notions that
chamber-music is lifeless.

in the quartet’s first Sydney concert
at the Town Hall last Saturday

Sydney Drama Festival
Sydney’s first Arts Council
Drama Festival, held at the
Technical College’s Turner Hall
last week, got off to a good
start with the Narrabeen Even-
ing College production of “Our
Town.” Adjudicator Robin
Lovejoy criticised the produc-
tion for a lack of theatricality
—harsh criticism indeed, for
this Thornton Wilder play relies
so much on stage-conventions-
but it achieved an atmosphere
and a standard that remained
unsurpassed until the fina
evening and Ida Newton s pro-
duction of “Hot Summer
Night,” which rightly took the
major prize.
The Stage Manager n
“Our Town” has a wonderful
part, but a great responsibility,
for he almost continually

THE RED-SHOULDERS
By E. O. SCHLUNKE
his mind’s eye birds lived
T continuously. The great
rhythms of eagles, riding
the up-rising air currents
..fried him clean out of his
Ire rooms; small fluttering
and darting finches made him
smile inwardly when he should
lave been at his most serious ;
lit exulted in abstracted
moments with galahs, jostling
and shrieking in strong winds ;
and he took vast journeys with
|e fast, high-flying migrants,
file the professors’ words
flew all around him, he watched
the semi-urbanised birds in the
trees and gardens through the
windows, reading in the briefest
{tees the purposes of all their
activities; hearing their greet-
ings, their calls to wandering
mates, their shrill cries of
alarm.
But now, back on his father’s
farm on vacation, he walked
with long strides across the
open country towards the
scrub; an avian Santa Claus
with a haversack on his back:
crumbs of cake for the pipits
that came fluttering and run-
ning through the grass at his
whistle; millet-seed for the
finches that watched him
Bright-eyed from the bushes, a
sugar-solution for honey eaters
which flipped tantalisingly close
to him while he re-filled the
non - contaminable self-feeder
he’d devised for them.
On, to the high, jutting ridge
"here the lichened rocks lay
patient. He had everything
a ped, from micro-organisms to
urge, roaming animals ; every-
m the three-hundred-acre
B [ ®ed and timbered paddock,

the tim P K eac h species. By
1 Sine tvi! reac hed the over-
ge °f the valley, the
birds about him no longer
noticed his approach ; crouch-
ing quiet and almost indistin-
guishable among the leaves,
they were giving all their atten-
tion to the greater menace
below.
He moved to the last large
tree before the ground fell, and
scanned the secluded valley
where he had taught the wild
ringneck-parrots to come at his
■whistle and eat the oats he had
brought them in his haversack.
There he saw the intruder,, the
latest development in nature’s
plan—man.
■ftjOT only the latest, but the
lowest: Sandy Ferris the
bird-trapper, with his covered
motor-lorry and his gear.
The shabby old ex-Army
vehicle, which might have par-
ticipated in many war-time
operations, still retained patches
of its camouflage paint as it
lumbered slowly among stumps
and logs.
John Latimer rapidly im-
provised plans. The truck
came slowly to a halt. Sandy
didn’t emerge, but waited for
the birds to accept his presence
among them. He knew, just as
well as John, just how long
that would take. Eventually
he got out, moving as slowly as
a tree bending in a soft wind.
He stood beside the truck, look-
ing and listening interminably ;
his eyes knowing, his features
large and blunt like a large
amiable animal’s. Time meant
almost nothing to Sandy.
He led a marginal existence
trapping wild birds, practically
all of them protected by law,
and selling them to urban
dealers who in turn sold them
to city bird-fanciers as cage-
bred. Once in Sandy’s trap the
handling had to be fast—down
to the city, through the crowded
miscellaneous markets where
turnover was quick. Since a
large percentage of trapped
wild birds were sure to die, it
was imperative that they arrive
at the suburban cages first. It
was a never-satisfied market.
Tlie Latimer property was
virtually a bird sanctuary, a
fabulous place for Sandy to
plunder in a district largely
cleared of trees and of birds.
A chance remark by a carrier,
overheard in a pub, the carrier
going to pick up a truck-load
of Latimer’s vealers for a sale,
was enough to induce Sandy to
take the risk ; in a town so
close to the earth it was un-
imaginable to people like Sandy
that any of the Latimers could
fail to be at the sale, glowing
with pride at the current prices
for fat Herefords.
Like a large preying animal,
wrapped in his many dun-
colored pullovers. Sandy made
a slow, cautious movement with
one arm ; a boy of about 16
got out of the other side of
the truck and was set to work,
the kind of boy who is brought
up with the minimum of
parental supervision in shacks
on the shabby outskirts of
country towns.
John remembered the boy’s
brief irregular attendance at
high-school; that he always
smelled of animals, and for
that reason was called “Dingo”
by the offensively respectable,
softened to “Ding” by the more
tolerant, of whom John was
one. Ding had a face like a
bright, wilful young monkey, a
face driven into obstinate
resistance by schoolteachers,
but now he was the perfect
Man Friday to Sandy.
The two of them set about
preparing an elaborate trap at
a distance from the truck far
enough to prevent its intimidat-
ing birds. The net, about 10ft.
long by 4ft. wide, worked by
a system of strong springs,
would leap out and cover an
area where grain had been
spread to entice birds. A great
deal of pegging - down and
stretching of cords and wires
had to be done. The boy did
most of it, Sandy the directing,
authoritative and exacting.
John watched the pre-
parations with a half-smile.
The longer the preparations,
the rpore he smiled. Then
abruptly his attention was
jerked from the trappers. A
flurry of wing- and tail-feathers
as a flock of impetuous birds
jammed on their airbrakes and
landed in his tree. Immedi-
ately the tree-top was full of

I! of the largest industrial undertakings
the Southern Hemisphere. A member
of the world-wide 1.C.1. organisation, the

M t h of the Commonwealth and
across the Tasman Sea to New Zealand.
There are, all told, 13 subsidiaries, four

I.CIA.N.Z. was formed in 1928 —
initial capital was £2,065,238 —as an off-
shoot of Imperial Chemical Industries,
Ltd. (U.K.), and although the public
were invited to subscribe a £1,000,000

ord scrip was not to be had until 1950
when the co. parcelled-out 1,006,505 20s.
ords. at a premium of 2s. 6d. Subsequent
issues, the most recent in 1957 on a two-
for-five basis at a premium of 55., have
lifted paid capital to £18,010,000. The
sharemarket puts a value of over £67
million on aggregate ord. equity today—
there are 17,010,000 20s. ords. on the

Group activities range the vast and

No detailed information is given
regarding the operations of the various
subsidiaries last term —the 12 months
ending September 30, 1959 —but group
turnover, a compounding of progressive
management, technical skill and
efficiency, rose to record heights. Sales
effervesced, rising £3.3 million, or 5.8
p.c., to £59.8 million. They were written
despite reductions, some substantial, in
the selling prices of many of the co.’s
products. All subsidiaries contributed
to the improved showing. There was
a strong demand for most of the co.’s
products throughout the' year. Business
activity in Australia was maintained at
a high level.. In general, secondary
industry was not seriously affected by
the reduced income of the pastoral
industry. The general level of the N.Z.
economy, however, reflected the setback
sustained last year by reason of depressed
prices for export products. Neverthe-
less, in a keenly competitive market, the
N.Z. subsidiary, 1.C.1. (N.Z.), achieved
a further increase of turnover.
Consolidated net profit, affected by
heavy expenditure on special research in
the field of olefine chemistry, edged for-
ward £70,840, or 2.3 p.c., to £3,077,969.
The richest precipitation of earnings to

Costs continued to rise during the year,
especially labor costs. The interest debit,
low in relation to funds raised, jumped
£128,522 to £441,806. Chairman K. G.
Begg comments “. . . we have succeeded
generally in stabilising our selling prices
during a period of rising costs.” Further,
he adds, and bearing in mind the almost
total cessation of import-controls last
February, “A heavy flow of imports,
however, would make it difficult for
Australian manufacturers to maintain
full use of their production-capacity,
thus aggravating their cost-problem.”
It remains to be seen, and the current
term will provide the answer, whether
benefits accruing from the liberalisation
of controls will outweigh effects of com-
petition from overseas. Overheads have
risen following recent marginal-wage
increases.
Earnings, after pref. divs., represent
17.8 p.c. on ord. capital as against
18.2 p.c. (average) in 1958 and 17.9 p.c.,
17.3 p.c., 17.1 p.c., 14.4 p.c. and 11.6
p.c. back to 1953. Reserves, benefiting
£1,326,969 undistributed profits (43 p.c.
of total profits), rose £1,468,379 to
£13,049,797 taking shareholders’ funds
above £3l million. The ord.-div. rate
was raised from 9 p.c. to 10 p.c.
Balance-sheet figures are testimony of
1.C.1.A.N.Z. growth. Capital investment
continued at an accelerated rate. Addi-
tions to plant and extensions to factories
brought about a net increase of
£1,733,869 in the book-value —cost or
valuation, less depreciation—of fixed
assets. Polythene capacity at Deer Park
(Vic.) was increased, the range of poly-
vynil-chloride products was extended and
Balm Paints Pty. opened-up a new
factory in Fremantle (W.A.). The co.
purchased the Commonwealth Govern-
ment’s nitrogen-synthesis plants at Villa-
wood (N.S.W.) and Ballarat (Vic.):

Projects on the drawing-board and
presently in process include expansion of
polythene manufacture at Botany
(N.S.W.) —the co. has arranged 100 p.c.
supply of ethylene from Shell Chemical
(Australia) Pty. under a special market-
ing agreement; ethylene comprises the
basic raw-material of polythene manu-
facture-manufacture of commercial


explosives at Bass Point (N.S.W.), manu-
facture of polythene-film at Villawood
and extension of the Osborne (S.A.)
alkali works. A huge £l|-million
pigment-plant is scheduled for construc-
tion at Altona (Vic.) and a new sub-
sidiary, to be formed shortly in N.Z.
under the joint auspices of 1.C.1.A.N.Z.
and Yorkshire Imperial Metals, Ltd.
(U.K.) —1.C.1. is an equal partner in
Yorkshire Imperial Metals with York-
shire Copper Works —with an initial
capital of more than £N.Z. 2 million,
will undertake manufacture of copper-
and copper-alloy-sheet, -strip and -tube.
1.C.1.A.N.Z. raised £3 million of note-
money last term, the issue lifting total
debenture- and note-outstandings to
£9| million —£3 million in 4 p.c. regis-
tered mortgage debentures redeemable

now £3 million in 7 p.c. registered
unsecured notes redeemable 1971-74.
The more-or-less liquid assets totalled
£28,712,896 at balance-date covering
current liabilities, £12,784,241, twice
over. The current ratio is 2.25.
The Australian economy is gathering
momentum. Secondary industry is forg-
ing ahead and primary industry is pulling
out of a slough. The mining industry
holds more promise today than it has for
many years and wool prices have firmed
in the past week. And prospects are shap-
ing brighter in N.Z., too. All things con-
sidered, 1.C.1.A.N.Z. looks a good buy
but for long-term holding rather than
quick turnover, a stock for institutional
portfolios rather than the small investor.
Immediate return is only 2.5 p.c. (with
the 20s. ords. at 795.), a mere pittance and
likely to remain such for a long time yet,
but earnings today, those that are
retained, mean bigger profits tomorrow,
other things being equal, and bigger
profits can mean bigger divs.
A cash-issue might be imminent, group
expansion showing no slack, but the
record discounts the probability, the
board increasingly favoring alternative
finance. The market still chafes from
last term’s note-issue. Meantime, at
balance-date, net tangibles weighed up a
solid £3O os. sd. the prefs. and 345. 2d.

Bruck Mills (Australia), Ltd.
HThe proud squire of Wangaratta had
a very difficult year. A loss was
incurred and the ord. dividend was passed.
Bruck Mills (Australia), Ltd., was
launched as a public co. in Melbourne
in 1946 by Bruck Silk Mills, Montreal,
Canada. The former Canadian parent
was open-handed and Australian investors
now hold £900,000 of the £1,195,500
ord. capital and all the prefs. (£250,000
20s. 5 p.c. cums.). The Canadian sponsor
retains a large minority interest, acquired
as consideration for its trade-marks,
technical services, machinery deliveries,
etc.
The co. is one of the largest Australian
weavers of synthetics and wool-synthe-
tics for the fashion-market and its per-
formance mirrors the general state of
the industry.
Market conditions have become very
trying. Costs are rising. The industry
has always been highly competitive and
subject to seasonal fluctuations and
changing tastes. Relaxation of import-
restrictions has resulted in marked inten-
sification of rivalry from overseas fabrics,
notably from lines imported from Japan.
Earnings were almost halved in 1958-59
and things became even more difficult in
1959-60.
Last year “proved to be one of the
most difficult trading-periods experienced
by the co. since its inception. For the
first six months severe competition from
the unrestricted flood of imported fabrics
caused the co. to suffer substantial losses,
while the effect of steps taken to pro-
duce new products and the increased
productivity from new machinery was
not at that time apparent.”
Trading profit for the year ended
June 30, 1960, decreased by £196,276
to £23,807, after providing £72,824 for
depreciation (down £6702), and £4769 for
amortisation of leaseholds.
After charging operating expenses, etc.
(up £11,542 at £54,851) and bringing-in
interest received (£l6l, down £4084) there
was a net loss of £30,883 compared with
a net profit of £116,019 earned in the
preceding term:

No divs. were paid on the ords. (8 p.c.
in the previous year and \2\ p.c. in
1958). The 5 p.c. pref.-div. was paid
from reserves.
Net loss for the year “represents a
substantial improvement on the trading
results for the first six months.” Since
then conditions are said to have picked-
up. “The trend of recovery has
continued at an improved rate into the
current financial year so that profits are
again being earned.”
The recent Tariff Board inquiry into
textiles of man-made fibres “was reason-
ably favorable” to the co. “Adequate
tariff protection has been given to a
wide variety of competitive fabrics.”
However, certain “higher-styled” and
more expensive fabrics (some of which
are described as “developmental”) were
given “very little protection” through
specific duty-rates. Bruck Mills pro-

Cash, etc. was much lower and the co.
arranged for an overdraft. The depre-
ciated value of plant, machinery, etc,,
was shown £lOO,OOO higher at £574,572,
reflecting extensive expansion and moder-
nisation. New machinery was imported
from Switzerland, West Germany,
Sweden and the U.S.A., including high-
speed looms, labor-saving dyeing- and
finishing-equipment and yarn processing
machines.
The co. is widening its range of fabrics
and is carefully following the trends in
consumer-tastes. The Japanese Govern-
ment Export Control is now limiting the
annual export of synthetic-fibre fabrics
to Australia both in quantity and in types
which “would do great damage” to the
domestic industry.
Directors are hopeful that all these
measures will succeed in turning the
tide and making current term’s trading
profitable. “Forward sales orders are
excellent.”
The overall position of the industry
remains difficult, and how successful
Bruck’s efforts will be remains to be seen,

Central Norseman Gold
Corporation, N.L.
A lthough production of gold
has steadily increased in
Australia during the post-war
period, it is still well below the
level of output in 1938-39. The
unprofitability of mining lower-
grade ore and the heavy costs
involved in opening-up new
mines indicate that pre-war
production will not be reached
in the near future. The Gold
Mining Industry Assistance
Act, passed in 1954 to check a
serious decline in goldmining
activity, through the payment
of a production subsidy, has
led to some increased produc-
tion.
Central Norseman Gold
Corp., N.L., is one of the few
remaining . unsubsidised pro-
ducers in W.A. The co. owns
a number of leases at Norse-
man (W.A.), including the
Phoenix- and Princess Royal-
mine properties. Paid capital,
£650,000, is in 2,600,000 ss.
f.-p. shares, approximately 51
p.c. of which are held by
Western Mining Corp., Ltd.,
general managers and con-
sultants. The co. operates a
plant capable of handling up
to 14,000 tons of ore a month.
Latest results from Central
Norseman (twelve months
ended March 29, 1960) reveal

WARRAGAMBA
The big job just about through.
This scene s all under water now.
By OLIVER FILTER
When New South Wales
Premier Heffron opens
Warragamba Dam
on Friday (October
14) he will be putting the official
seal on a job which started a
few million years ago—give or
take a few million. The original
contractor was not, as some
impatient gardeners have sug-
gested, the Sydney Water
Board, but the greatest builder
of them all—old Dame Nature
herself.
, Somewhere in. the early
Cainozoic era —the era which
saw the mammals rise to
dominance and the appearance
of primates, first the great apes
and then man—the industrious
old lady bent the Triassic rocks
along an axis which was later
to become that of the Warra-
gamba Gorge. The bending
caused incipient cracks in the
brittle sandstone, and these
were later to guide the course
of the Warragamba River when
it began to carve its gorge in
the hard sandstones.
Coming back later to look
at the job—roughly about a
million years ago—she found
the ancestors of the Nepean,
Warragamba, Cox’s and Wol-
londilly Rivers flowing slug-
gishly across a level plain. No
doubt thinking of Sydney’s
future water - supply, she
realised that the only thing to
do was to speed these streams
up a little. She did this simply
by lifting the whole of eastern
Australia, tilting it to the east
and bending it at the same time,
so that at Wallacia the former
surface of the level plain is
150 ft. above sea-level, while
one mile west it is 400 ft. above
sea-level, and at Katoomba
3500 ft. above that.
Having done that job, to an
accompaniment of large and
noisy earthquakes, the old girl
retired and left the rivers to
carve out an ideal site for a
city’s water-supply. The Cox's
and Wollondilly, now really on
the move, cut down through
the hard Triassic rock to the
softer Permian stuff under-
neath and began widening their
valleys by undercutting the
towering sandstone cliffs and
bringing great sections crashing
down into their beds.
The Warragamba, into which
they both flowed, was also cut-
ting its own gorge, but in this
case a steep and narrow one,
because it did not break
through to the soft Permian
rock.
Nattai, one of the tributaries.
The finished earthmoving anc(
landscaping job left the Cox's
and Wollondilly Rivers, with
their tributaries the Kowmung,
Nattai and Wingecarribee, col-
lecting the rainfall from an
area of 3383 square-miles anti
pouring it down into Burra-
gorang Valley, from which the
only outlet is the steep and
narrow course of the Warn-
gamba, a 14-mile river which
flows into the Nepean.
All you have to do, said old
Dame Nature, is stick a plus
in the Warragamba and you vs
got the lot.
Tt was some time before aoj-
one listened to her.

referred to the “Waragombie’’ ;
in 18)8 Sir John Jamison used
“Warra Gumba” ; and in 1825
Surveyor-General John Oxley
appears to have been first in
with Warragamba. “Warra”
and“Gamba” mean swamp and
tea-tree respectively, but the
whereabouts of an old tea-tree
swamp from which the river
may have taken its name is not
recorded.
Strzelecki appears to have
been the first to have com-
mented on the river’s possibili-
ties as a water-supply, writing
m 1845 that “The whole
County of Cumberland may
also be laid out in irrigated
lands by means of the Grose
and Warragambia.”
In 1869, Lieutenant T.
Woore, a member of the Syd-
D oy Water Commission ap-
pointed to do something about
me city’s water-supply, pro-
M a 170 ft.-high dam across
e Warragamba, but his sug-
Seshon was knocked back in

near the top.
Still, the job was not without
its interesting moments. The
ingredients of the concrete in-
cluded 2,500,000 tons of sand
and gravel—“gravel” in this
case means water - smoothed
stones up to 6in.-diameter —
and Nature made a bit of a
blue here.
Some centuries ago she
washed it all down out of the
Warragamba, into the Nepean
and along to McCann’s Island,
near Penrith. The board had
to build a aerial rope-
way from McCann’s to Warra-
gamba to cart the stuff back to
where it was needed. The
buckets travelling on the over-
head wires—-they delivered 170
tons an hour for 24 hours a
day—became one of the best-
known landmarks at the foot
of the Mountains.
Another incidental job of
some interest was the clearing,
Trees are a damn’ nuisance as
far as dams are concerned —
once submerged by the rising
water they can rot and drift
down to foul the outlets
for water-supply and hydro-
electric purposes. With Warra-
gamba, more than 17,000 acres
of Burragorang Valley and its
rivers had to be cleared, and
the finished job looked as
though someone had run a
giant electric-razor around the
220 miles of foreshores up to
the eventual top-water level,
Except for about £2OOO-
- of mainly bluegum cut
out of Warragamba Gorge, the
cleared timber was not of much
use—earlier timbergetting by
settlers and the board itself had
seen to that and it was
stacked and burnt green as
soon as it was felled,
Some of the clearing was
done by private contract, but
most of it by the board. There
were up to 500 men on the job,
living in tents and cooking for
themselves on iron grates over
10ft. by 2ft. fireplaces fed with

From Herbert Holman
MUW is the cradle of sport,
E mi as we are so often
winded in international con-
els. a go° d way below the
best in performance-
It k open to question whether
ft inadequacy will be dis-
jat by another, very English,
Lctice—the appointment of a
iwlittee to investigate and
report . Nevertheless, Sir John
Wolfenden and his colleagues
lave just completed a two-
year investigation, having inter-
viewed, among many authori-
ties seven bishops, 41 M.P.s
a J the Cambridge University
Tiddlywinks Club.
This research, though un-
doubtedly less distressing than
i previous one carried-out by
(lie same chairman, is rather
long-winded, in content as well
as in phrase. Its main finding
is that we haven’t enough run-
ning-tracks, swimming - baths,
fitted-up cpen-air spaces and
up -to - date changing - rooms,
grandstands and the like. This
lack was well appreciated be-
forehand. In fact, both politi-
cal parties have mooted the
possibility of an annual sub-
sidy of £5 million. The Wol-
fenden Committee has settled
on the same figure from the
State, but recommends a fur-
ther annual sum of the same
amount to be raised and spent
by local authorities.
Other recommendations are
better training-schemes, with
qualifying courses for part-time
coaching, and practical en-
couragement for the enjoyment
°i ? Um * nor ” pursuits as
combing, riding, fencing, ski-
®§> sailing, canoeing and
archery (which are appealing
mc| e and more to young
people). y s

derate deception of
the public” and it may also
“put in a deservedly embarrass-
ing position the person who
gives his name to the article
and then finds himself credited
with views he does not hold.”
Fair comment—but is there
any hope of change in this
personality-conscious age?
West Riding Novelists
Small-town life in Yorkshire
is the background of three out-
standing novels of recent years.
John Braine’s Room at the Top
was the first, Keith Water-
house’s Billy Liar, the second
and Stan Barstow’s A Kind of
Loving the third.
The three have much in
common. Two are first novels
and the other a second. The
authors are young. Their cen-
tral character is, in the literary
sense, unpleasant. The manner
of the books is impolite, insofar
as the language is coarse and
the sexual treatment uninhi-
bited. All of them are pessi-
mistic and, in varying degrees,
tragic.
In approach, however, they
are dissimilar. Room at the
Top can seem flamboyant and
overwritten and the author
cheats himself out of his theme.
Billy Liar, representing 40
hours in the life of a fantast,
is the most imaginative. A
Kind, of Loving is the most
naturalistic, the most tender
and the most promising. Mr.
Barstow, a 32- year - old
draughtsman turned engineer-
ing-salesman, already has the
technical equipment of the
mature novelist. His story
concerns a 20-year-old boy
\yho, as a consequence of a
flirtation, comes to a set of
circumstances far more harrow-
ing than mere grief. He is just
sowing wild oats. She is love-
hungry. The inevitable forced
marriage has to be arranged
and suffering—financial, emo-
tional and familial heaps
upon the unhappy young man.
Despite the excessive frank-
ness about the mechanics of
courtship and the unsatisfac-
tory outcome of a forced
marriage, the novel is really a
study in immaturity. The most
poignant scene is when the lad,
thrown-out by ! mother-in-law
for being drunk, goes to the
sister he adores for sympathy
and mothering and gets neither.
Instead, she gives kindly, but
firmly, the plain truth.
The story is told in the first-
person and in a vernacular rich
in idiom.
Grubby Fantasy
Of the three novels, Billy
Liar would seem to be the least
suited for the stage. Yet the
author, in collaboration with
another Yorkshireman, Willis
Hall, has achieved an evening’s
entertainment (Cambridge
Theatre), if not a very good
play. In fact, the devices
(some of them Chekhovian) to
give dramatic unity and pro-
gression leave little impact.
It is the performance of one
of our leading young classical
actors, Albert Finney, that
makes the evening memorable.
Finney gets right inside the
part of the liar, Billy Fisher,
who is at once indolent, wily,
mixed - up, quick - witted and
demonstrative. He is, more-
over, a day-dreamer and a
petty rogue.
For dramatic reasons, the
action is cut to some 12 hours
and another girl-friend (the
third) is introduced. During
this period, Billy copes, or fails
to cope, with a (naturally)
suspicious employer, two
(mutually exclusive) fiancees, a
kindly mother, an angry father,
a dying grandmother and,
finally, the one girl who, per-
haps, might have made some-
thing out of him. But, as ex-
pected, he is unable to face
reality—a trip to London and
a possible career as a script-
writer returning ignomini-
ously to his lies and fantasy.
The author’s treatment and
Lindsay Anderson’s production
are towards the farcical, and the
first act is a continual scream.
Afterwards there is some loss
of tempo and interest, but the
third act contains a gem of
improvisation when, anticipat-
ing the funeral, Billy dramatises
a military oration, imagining
himself the chaplain and his
grandmother a person beloved
of the regiment.
A strange affair, really, and
hardly theatre-worthy. Yet Mr.
Finney induces sympathy and
brings out the underlying
pathos.


An Old New Australian Discusses Assimilation
My Children Are Good Aussies
By "MACARONI"
P lease allow me a few remarks re
your editorial (B. 7/9/’6O) dealing
with '‘Australia’s Racial Unity.” I
am rather an Old Australian by
the new name now (when I came here
from Pantelleria Island in 1925 I was
called “Dago”). This is to begin with —
and you seem to know little about geo-
graphy if in your valuable paper Sicily is
referred to as an appendix of Italy—
a colony or something like it. I must
point out that in Sicily, in Pantelleria,
even in Malta, the language is Italian,
not Arab or English; schools, univer-
sities and all the past and present are
simply and purely Italian. Yes, the so-
called depressed toe of Italy and Sicily
form an integral part of Marconi or
Macaroni Land as you might call it.
Regarding this old, very old item,
the White Australia policy, I agree with
you on most of this, but what I cannot
digest is this: myself and many more
like me, rather long here, still have our
foreign brogue. I cannot (I tried to do
my best) overcome it and, like the
Scotch, it will be there till I die. Local-
born people that come in contact with
me very often ask how long I have been
here and if I like the country. Surely
I do, because I have my own family, my
own house; one daughter married to
another Australian and with two snow-
white children. My wife, an Australian,
too, brought-up seven New half-Italians
and half-Aussies. And by all accounts
they look quite white —three daughters
blonde and one boy a blond, too. Not
too bad for a father from Pantelleria!
'T'he White Australia policy has noth-
ing to desire from me. I have a
good family and I am very proud of it,
too. Instead of immigrants, they were
born here and haven’t any foreign im-
pediment in their speech. I have worked
hard all my life and still do work hard
—I haven’t any fruit- or fish-and-chips
shops, either. Paid all my fare to come
out here in 1925 and the first job I had
was cutting firewood for a Bundaberg
sugarmill—a job no Aussie would like
to take, neither then nor now. No power-
saws in those days. Yes, I brought them
up all by my own efforts and nobody
yet gave me nothing for nothing.
With all this White Australia policy
I have just to look around me here and
find some remarkable facts even among
my closer relations—sisteps-in-law. One
sister five children ; another three (one
dead); another one only; another one
(and one dead) —no more to come
because the father hates children! All
this around close relatives, but how
many more couples have none, or one
or two, or one and the dear old dog?
Do the people here worry over the
White Australia policy? No, they don’t
because it’s must haye a new car, a beauti-
ful home, and beautiful furniture, and
children interfere at the different sports
tournaments. Many young married
couples don’t want a family because
both are employed and while young they
must go here and there on their annual
holidays. No wonder Mr. Downer wants
immigrants! The Australian marrieds
hardly reproduce themselves.
Tf you find any Italians from Trento
-*• or from Pantelleria that misbehave,
send them home. I am in accord with
you. But don’t single-out the south part
of Italy alone. Remember this: blond
or carrot-head peoples don’t hail only
from Northern Europe ; no matter where
they come from or how white they are,
they must wash themselves to keep clean.
This White Australia policy at times
has been carried too far. During last
war a Labor Premier of Queensland
said if he had his way he wouldn’t have
a single Italian in Queensland. The
racial hate has been carried too far and
that explains why so many Italians got
interned, naturalised or not. I was one
of them, and what a treat did we have!
Two crippled from Queensland and one
totally blind from South Australia —an
old helpless man to that! So many
thousands kept away; wife and children
near starvation ; many ruined financially
—I lost my life-policy and three months’
holiday after working for the Queensland
Government for 18 years. That was my
bonus. Why not send us to work under
escort and, if we were misbehaving, shoot
us? That would have been a better idea.
In your article, regarding oasis of
different nationalities in the United States,
you are off the mark there. When I got
released and while in Brisbane I went
to a restaurant for a plate of macaroni,
but I could hardly get it because the
place was full of American servicemen,
mostly talking away merrily in Italian.
In America very few got interned be-
cause they would have to intern a mil-
lion in New York alone. Then even
the Mayor of New York was of Italian
descent—Fiorello La Guardia.
During that period of war-hysteria
the son of one of my friends, a tobacco-
farmer at Mareeba (N.Q.), came to
Townsville for a doctor’s examination for
military recruiting. On the way home in
the train there were some Australian
and American soldiers, so some Aussies
asked him a few questions. The poor
thing had my handicap—that foreign
accent —so on finding that out our fellow
Aussies wanted to throw him out the
train. The Americans came to his rescue
and took him safely home.
we shall come to the assimilation
part of this epistle. I cannot discuss
about the southern States of Australia,
but as far as the Sugar Belt is con-
“™c'v hel \ rd „ ab ,° ut assimilation,
the 1920 s and all the Little ItaUesV
were springing up. Where are thevTl

part of Australia. I am getting old*
many more of my breed alike. We’wi
pass out shortly and our offspring will be
to all intents and purposes true Austra-
lians, as you want them.
Please leave us old fellows die in peace
with the memory of Old Italy and the
sun and songs of our mother-country
to go with us to the tomb. But as alive
we must be, before being true Aussies
we must have been true Italians.
Now I must ask you: why so much
fuss about getting naturalised? Frederick
Johnson was the son of an English
chemist in Milano, Italy, so the Italian
Touring Club being formed in 1892 he
was our first secretary. When, in 1915,
war broke out, he joined the Italian
armed forces and: went to the front as
a lorry-driver. A good Englishman and
a splendid and generous Italian. Italian
born, but he always kept his British
nationality and there nobody pulled him
by the coat to say that he must be a
naturalised Italian. British shops, indus-
tries, churches are there in nearly all the
bigger cities and to own a shop nobody
worries over so long taxes are paid. In
France after you reside there for six
months you do become a French citizen
without any mayors or governors or the
like bothering to put on robes of office
and deliver speeches, congratulations
from all and sundry. In fact I fail t»
see any reason or use for so much fuss.
To own one acre or one square yard
of land you must get naturalised, and it
you are not you must pay taxes just the
same. Sounds rather ridiculous, but as
the so-called law of the country is, j e
it be. One thing that needs no coercion

There will be tremendous
interest in the meeting next
Saturday of Wenona Girl and
Lady Sybil in the One Thous-
and Guineas (actual worth,
4000 guineas).
It was said here last week
that the merit of Lady Sybil’s
win in the Edward Manifold
Stakes at Flemington had to
be seen to be appreciated, and
the same could be said of her
win in last Saturday’s Caulfield
Guineas. Camer rode Sky High
hard from his wide barrier to
take up the running, while
Higgins dropped Lady Sybil
into third place. Coming to the
home-turn the filly moved up
to Sky High and passed that
good colt as if he were a
novice. With Higgins sitting
quietly, Lady Sybil coasted
home three lengths clear of
Sky High, who just beat the
fast-finishing Liqueur for
second money.
Lady Sybil has won five races
in a row since August, and
gets better all the time. The
Guineas is a difficult race for
fillies —only Midilli and Wiggle
had beaten the colts since 1920
—which emphasises the class of
Lady Sybil. Good as Wenona
Girl is, she is not likely to
trouble this filly.
One Thousand Guineas:
Lady Sybil, 1 ; Wenona Girl,
2 ; Lady Major, 3.
In the early charts on the
Caulfield Cup, the four-year-
old Smokey Eyes horse Optic
Prince was near the top, based
on a hat-trick of runaway wins
in the late winter. He had
slipped from favor after run-
ning badly against the better
horses in the early spring, but
bookmakers moved him back
to a prominent place when he
scored an easy win in Satur-
day’s 12-furlongs Herbert
Power Handicap.
Most of the runners in the
Herbert Power were Caulfield Cup
entrants, and as the winner drops
51b. to 7.3 he must be reckoned
a chance in the big race. Adelaide
gelding Teastream, second to Optic
Prince, has some sort of chance
in the Cup with his feather-
weight 7st.

Few men have made such
a financial success of racing as
Adelaide owner Dan Moriarty,
and not many understand the
racing game as well. Moriarty
walked around the Caulfield
course last Friday with the
Adelaide apprentice Tony May
(leading rider in his home city
this season) and discovered
that the best going on the
heavy track was about two
horses wide from the running-
rail. He instructed May to
position his horse, St. Pierre,
to get the best of the going
in the 1010 Welter (nine fur-
longs), and, riding explicitly
to instructions, the lad brought
St. Pierre home a convincing
winner.
St. Pierre is a Caulfield Cup
entrant, but he has not shown that
he can get a distance. Ilumquh
was a very warm favorite for the
1010, but this one-time Caulfield
Cup favorite does not seem class
enough.
It is frequently said that the
mile Toorak Handicap is a
useful guide to the Caulfield
Cup, but that’s a misconcep-
tion. Since 1940 only Royal
Gem (1946) and Grey Boots
(1950) have won the Toorak-
Caulfield double. On Satur-
day Gabonia, who had never
won beyond six furlongs,
raced clear in the last 100yds.
to win the Toorak. He’s a
Caulfield Cup entrant, but
won’t run, and it seems un-
likely that any that finished
behind him will improve
enough to win the Caulfield
Cup, with the possible excep-
tion of Webster, who has not
had much racing this season
and could improve on his
fourth.

Although the imported sire
Coronation Boy has Carbine
blood in his veins—his dam,
Persian Bloom, is a grand-
daughter of Carbine’s son
Spearmint—he was himself a
sprinter, and since he went to
the stud in 1956 has proved a
sire of sprinters. On Saturday
at Caulfield he was represented
by three colts in the Debutant
Stakes (two-year-olds; 4^
furlongs), and they filled the
Boy, Royal
Belltor and Cotillion.
Trim Boy had won his previous
two races in Adelaide, but Vic-
torian punters preferred the un-
raced Cotillion, because he had
proved himself on the track a much
better galloper than his stablemate,
Valala, a winner at Flemington of
the Maribyrnong Trial Stakes.
Cotillion was slowly away, but he
would not, in any case, have beaten
Trim Boy, who looked a possible
Maribyrnong Plate winner as .he
coasted home an easy victor in
the Debutant.

Arthur and Jack Trim. They have

Tulloch's Triumph
The 26,000 crowd at Rand-
wick last Saturday —final day
of the A.J.C. spring meeting
—saw Tulloch show his four
opponents in the £2550 Craven
Plate how a champion gallops.
The crowd made ample amends
for some of the stupidity
“You can have it! You CAN HAVE IT!”
howled when the champ, was
beaten twice at his previous
starts. The reception was one
of the best a winner has ever
had at Randwick. It started
when he hit the front and
lasted long after the race.
Astutely ridden by Seliwood,
Tulloch went right away in
the final stages of the 10-
furlongs, easily leading Persian
Lyric and Valerius home.
Time, 2.5, was slow for a firm
track, but that was due to the
muddling pace over the first
half of the journey. Tulloch
has now had 38 starts for 28
wins, nine seconds and a third,
with £77,623 in stakes to his
credit.
Before he competes in the
Victoria Derby—into which,
after his showing in winning
the Clibborn Stakes, he now
seriously enters calculations as
a strong contender —Rosehill-
trained Wire Service is ex-
pected to have a run at the
Moonee Valley Cup meeting
next Saturday week. He had
no trouble beating his three
opponents on Saturday. Again,
time was on the slow side —
2.5 i for the 10 furlongs —but
the Clibborn, too, was more-
or-less a muddling affair. Wire
Service had finished fourth in
the A.J.C. Derby and in both
the Rosehill and the Canter-
bury Guineas. The colt could
make it interesting in Mel-
bourne.
Fine And Dandy, having his
first race since early July, when
he missed a place in the
Doomben Ten Thousand, came-
home very strongly to beat
Merry Polly and Royal Feast
in the six-furlongs Chester
Handicap. The good sprinter
is billed to have a shot at the
£6OOO “Hallmark” Stakes on
V.R.C. Derby Day, and he’ll
take beating. He won the
Chester with 9.3 in fast
time, 1.11.
Canterbury Park trainer Jack
Denham started No Match and
Grande Brio in the Widden
Stakes, both running in the
same interests, and they
finished first and second in
that order, with Emblem third.
The winner, at odds-on,
atoned for her moderate dis-
play in the Gimcrack Stakes
for which she was backed
6-to-4 favoritism. Another of
80 °d Youngsters by
Wilkes (imp.), No Match is
from Philgita by Piccadilly
(imp.) from Fairy Mag by
Magpie (imp.). Philgita also
threw winners Count Roussel
Barwick and Judith Helen
Her latest winner is a product
of Newhaven Park Stud
Boorowa (N.S.W.). Both
Grande Brio and third place-
getter Emblem (a sister to
Wenona Girl) should soon
win.
Before he competed in
barrier-trials at Randwick and
Rosebery, winning easily at
both courses, two-year-old Pan
Shah had been galloping the
place down at Rosehill, where
he’s trained by John Norman,
who races the grey colt in
partnership with Mrs. Norman.
Then he had finished third to
Young Brolga in the Breeders’
Plate. His own turn came
when, favored by No. 1 at the
start, he early took the lead
and held it to the finish of the
Canonbury Stakes. Take Over
ran greenly in second place.
Pan Shah is by the French-
bred sire Pan II (imp.) from
Pharos Queen and belongs to
the family-line which produced
stayers Murray Stream, Tri-
valve, Hall Mark and Nuffield
His dam is by Pherozshah

The “London Letter” in
this issue deals with the report
of a U.K. committee set-up
to look into causes of British
“failures” in sporting per-
formance. By way of dry
comment on the setting-up of
the committee and its findings,
Britain’s Rugby Leaguers won
the World Cup last Saturday,
solidly beating the touring
Australians, 10-3. The winners
scored their 10 points in the
first half —penalty goal, con-
verted try and a try —and
then doggedly defended
through the second half, with
the Australians only able to
break through . once for their
lone score. In the heavy going
Britain won well.

“Kabara”: While Melbourne
this season continued its V.F.L.
dominance, the domination by two
other clubs of their respective
Australian Rules competitions came
to a halt. Port Adelaide had won
the last six successive Adelaide
premierships, but all through 1960
it was clear that the Magpies were
no certainties for this year’s title.
They reached the preliminary-final,
where they were eliminated
8.11-3.14 by Norwood. Then Nor-
wood went down by five points to
North Adelaide, who won their
first premiership since 1952 (when
they also met Norwood in the
“grand,” but walloped them by 18
goals). Also eliminated in their
preliminary-final by the eventual
winner, Oakleigh, was Williams-
town, top-dogs of the V.F.A. in
recent years, winning five of the
six premierships from 1954 to 1959,
missing out in 1957, when Moorab-
bin won. Sandringham—the team
beaten (by 10 goals, 18.14-8.14) by
Oakleigh in the grand-final—showed
a great improvement this year.

Every season the
number of cricketers willing to
travel to Sydney each weekend
to play first-grade with city
clubs seems to increase. For

man Jim de Courcy and fast-bowler
Les Ellis will make the trip from
Newcastle. State all - rounder
Johnny Martin will continue to
come from Burrell’s Creek, near
Taree, to turn-out for Petersham-
Marrickville. To play for Waverley,
spin-bowler Gamini Goonesena will
be making the trip from Canberra,
where he’s an official of the
Government of Ceylon. As a rule
players travelling from the country
require a permit from the N.S.W.
Cricket Association; one exception
is Cumberland batsman Wilf Ewers,
who travels from Bathurst. He
has a special qualification, through
having played 10 years for a club.

UNCABLED
ADDITIONS
WANTED —WHITE MEN
Tr has been obvious for some
-*■ time that Africans cannot
run Africa unaided —that they
need more, not less, white
know-how in administration,
teaching, science, etc., to
develop the continent. But as
more and more States reach
independence this need is as-
suming the size of a prob-
lem. London “Economist” out-
lines it this way:
“Already the problem is not
to get white men out of Africa
but to keep them in. The
Sudanese, in 1956, quickly re-
gretted that they had hounded-
out respectable and useful
district commissioners under
the stigma of ‘colonisers.’ The
error has been noted. Today
the African leaders in all British
colonial territories express
alarm at the alacrity with
which their former oppressors
seize the first opportunity to
depart with their compensa-
tion ; the British Government
has finally been pummelled into
increasing, at the expense of
the British taxpayer, the in-
ducement to them to stay on,
though it is still unsure if the
ante has been raised enough.
“Beyond this, an important
international market in white
men for Africa has grown up.
In Britain one of the bigger
recruiting-agencies is the Crown
Agents, but many African
States advertise their wants
directly in the public-appoint-
ments columns. Non-British
are obtained in part through
the United Nations, through
such international organisations
as the World Bank, through
friendly Governments, and
through special foundations—
including universities, especially
American ones. (It is now very
much the smart thing for an
American university to have an
African State as a sort of field-
laboratory for its economic
department.) And the Russians,
of course, now playing their
calculated part in the new and
different scramble for Africa,
supply their own people direct
as well as Czechs, East Ger-
mans and Poles, according to
specification.
“It is a bull market. It is

not possible yet to give a
current quotation for central-
ba n k governors, hydraulic-
engineers, general-managers, or
even chief schools-inspectors ;
the reason for this is that rates
vary with local conditions, with
the preferred European tribe,
and with quality.
“It is evident that it will be
much harder to get white men
to run the Congo railways than
to do comparable work in, say,
Tanganyika; this is partly a
matter of the supply of non-
Belgian French-speaking rail-
way-experts who would con-
sider Africa at all, partly a
question of the security of life
under the rule of the Force
Publique.
“A preliminary scout-round
by the United Nations for
experts to replace the Belgians
proved somewhat discouraging,
though about 400 U.N. civilian
staff (from 33 countries) have
now been scraped together
there. Whatever the price of
white men in Africa may be,
it is rising ; in the Congo it
has doubled since July.
“All this may upset some
Africans who have simply
taken it for granted that a
steady process of Africanisation
is in prospect. Africanisation
or the lack of it Buf
ambuions are proceeding 2."

one proposal which deserves
examination is the formate
of an integrated Common,
wealth Administrative Service
the personnel of which could
be lent to emergent countries,
“T h e Government rightly
points out, however, that newly
independent countries might be
reluctant to use such personnel
who would still retain formal
links with the mother country,
They would be suspected of
having divided loyalties.
“In the long term this objec-
tion makes sense. It is per-
fectly true that the only white
men who will be permanently
acceptable in black Africa are I
those prepared to cut adrift j
from Britain, with all the risks j
that involves. But on the short-
term it is necessary to prevent
a mass exodus by stop-gap
methods, even if they are less
than ideal.
“There should be no quib-
bling or cheese-paring, as has
been the case with the unfor-
tunate expatriate railwaying
in Nigeria who apparently are
to be denied the inducements
which only go to civil servants.
What is required is a system of
lavish inducements over a
short period. Money cannot
persuade the whites to stay for
ever. But it can persuade them
to stay long enough to avow
Congo tragedies.”

The man on the land
knows from experience:
there is no satisfactory
substitute for STEEL PIPE
After experimentation with other types of piping,
experienced land men invariably come to one
conclusion there’s no really satisfactory sub-
stitute for Steel Pipe.
Steel Pipe, for instance, is not susceptible to
damage by stock, fire, rodents or termites and
can, therefore, be laid above ground saving
trenching costs.
In addition it has greater strength, longer life,
and can stand greater pressures. Steel Pipe is
easy to handle or store without fear of breakage,
and is adaptable to innumerable uses.
Why take risks with other fragile, easily damaged,
shorter-lived types of piping!

Canada, Australia and New
Zealand, is of enormous im-
portance to both countries
economically. The volume of
water carried annually by the
six rivers in the Indus system
is estimated at twice that of the
Nile. The development-works
under the treaty will make
possible the irrigation of a far
greater area than hitherto, and
make a vital contribution to
the struggle to raise the
standard of living in both
countries.”
* * *
London “Economist”: “The
£3BO-million programme is the
biggest irrigation-scheme ever
to have been undertaken any-
where. When it is finished in
10 to 13 years India will have
the use of the three eastern
rivers and Pakistan the use of
water brought by canal from
the three western rivers. The
lives of, in all, some 50-million
people in an area of 30-million
acres will be affected.
“Even before the partition
of India and Pakistan disputes
were persistent between the
provinces of the Indian Empire
over the division of these
waters ; from 1947 they became
international disputes, deeper
and more bitter than before. In
1954 the World Bank produced
the proposals on which the
present scheme is based ; for
six years it has been trying to
heave the argument out of
politics onto the firmer ground
of engineering and finance. Its
success is a monument to
dogged persistence.”
* * *
Manchester “G u a r d i a n”:
“Why has the will to reach
agreement only now triumphed
over the mistrust and antagon-
isms that have hitherto stood
in the way? Some people
answer, ‘a common threat from
outside.’ This may have helped,
but Indians and Pakistanis were
moving towards a settlement
months before the revolt of
Lhasa and last autumn’s border
incursions by the Chinese. A
more important factor was
probably the stability of the
two Governments.
“President Ayub [of Pakis-
tan] could offer more daring
compromises than the short-
lived Cabinets that preceded
him, and the Indian negotiators
came to appreciate the import-
ance of this. Above all there
was the persistence of Mr. Iliff
and his colleagues in the World
Bank ; and finally six friendly
Governments agreed to contri-
bute $4lO million towards the
cost and thus cut through some
of the financial difficulties.”
London “Financial Times”:
“A number of features of the
agreement are worthy of note.
The first one is the New
Zealand contribution. New
Zealand is not a member of the
World Bank. It is putting up
£lm. without having been
asked. Secondly, Germany,
which is making some £llm.
available, is on this occasion
making its first outright grant
to a development project. With
the German reserves still rising
steeply and the capacity of the
underdeveloped countries to
take-on hard loan-commitments
strictly limited, one cannot but
hope that this precedent will be
followed on other occasions.”
* * *
New York “Herald Tribune”:
“Monumental as the Indus
development itself is, no less
significant is the growing rap-
prochement it represents be-
tween India and Pakistan —
whose war of partition, except
for the two World Wars, was
the bloodiest of the century.
President Ayub, who has been
working hard toward concilia-
tion, has made it clear that he
hopes the Indus agreement may
be a prelude to final settlement
of the thorniest problem of all,
that of Kashmir.”
Dragnet Digest
Allen W. Dulles (Director of
Central Intelligence A gened
“W.e are still too prone to
believe that the Communist
movement is no more than an
international conspiracy 0 f
evil men interested solely in
their own power. The situation
is not that simple. The threat
is far greater and the defence
far more difficult. The threat
is greater because many Com-
munists are not mere conspira-
tors but fantastically dedicated
men.”

Joseph Alsop, in the New
York “Herald Tribune”: “With
the sole exception of Australia-
New Zealand, there is not a
single area on the face of the
globe where the decline of
American influence and the
rise of Soviet influence cannot
be clearly observed. Even in
Western Europe the Soviets
have openly begun to attack
the freedom of West Berlin by
carefully calculated salami
tactics. The aim is clear. This
country [the U.S.] has no more
sacred trust. Yet the American
and Western. response to the
attack on Berlin has thus far
been feeble and indecisive.”

M a ’little down the slope ;
«reat concern about the separa-

w ho should join whom.
JOHN was just as excited as the
J birds; there was a kind of
parrot he’d never identified
before- Ravaged gum-blossoms
began to fall on his upraised,
delighted face.
A nectar-eating parrot!
He strained his eyes trying
to catch glimpses of them,
while his mind raced through
the pages of his Cayley for
identification. It was a tall
tree, and the birds were harvest-
ing only the topmost blossoms.
He caught glimpses of them
springing vigorously from clus-
ter to cluster.
A parrot of tremendous
energy and vitality ; as quick
to pluck, plunder and discard
a blossom, as a finch in its
twinkle-of-an-eye seizing, husk-
ing and swallowing of a millet-
seed. Among the dull-green
foliage of the ironbark-tree he
had momentary glimpses of
bright-green, red and yellow
plumage; a bird about the size
of a grey thrush or noisy miner.
Through the hearty feeding

Ferri s 6 rernem bered Sandy
Sandy was watching the boy
sprinkling the oats ; the trap,
apparently, set to his satisfac-
tion. Then they walked back
to the truck, Sandy unravelling
the cord that sprang the trap.
Ding got into the canopied
rear of the truck, and handed-
out a small cage to Sandy,
which he, with an air of tre-
mendous responsibility, carried
back and placed with extreme
judgment at a site among the
sprinkled grain. In the cage
was a green ringneck-parrot, a
“caller,” whose duty it was in
Sandy’s scheme of things to
lure all ringnecks within hear-
ing to the trap.
Because wild ringnecks are
brave and chivalrous they can
be lured by a very mean trick ;
when they hear one of their
kind giving terrified squawks,
as Sandy’s captive very soon
did when Sandy beat the sides
of the cage with a stick, they
come hurrying to its help.
So John’s ringnecks, arriving
full of fight, saw Sandy, his
trap and motor-lorry, decided
the odds were too heavily
against them for immediate
attack and perched in a nearby
tree, condemning Sandy with
avian swear - words: “Quot
chot! Quot chot!”
Sandy, apparently satisfied
that the rest was routine,
walked quietly back to his
truck. His parrot would soon
settle down and talk to the
visitors. They, encouraged,
would come close to the cage,
see the sprinkled grain—and
they’d be his ; £lO a pair for
all that reached Sydney alive.
Dut just as the parrots were
entering the danger-zone a
familiar call came to them, a
call they associated with free
meals, and no trap and motor-
lorry to deter them. They flew
eagerly to John’s tree, waiting
for his handout. Only Sandy's
eyes moved at this unexpected
setback. He continued to sit
patiently in his truck with the
trip-cord in his hand, confident
of a rewarding haul.
Quiet settled down in the
valley. The other birds, re-
covering from the fright of
Sandy’s intrusion, began to
talk to each other, commenting
on the queer happenings. John’s
wild ringnecks waited confi-
dently for the oats from his
haversack, disregarding for the
time being the cries from
Sandy’s caller.
But birds have very short
memories and no power of
reasoning. Soon they suc-
cumbed to the lure of Sandy’s
caller. Twice they started off
for the- trap, and twice John
recalled them.
Each time Sandy’s eyes
rolled, and his bushy eyebrows
twitched. The sun meanwhile
declined in a wintry hurry,
making it impracticable for
Sandy to set-up his trap else-
where. At last he got out of
his truck to see what was up-
setting the wild ringnecks.
John came out from behind
his tree and ran quickly to the
trap. He picked up the ring-
neck in its cage, and kicked the
trip-cord, which set off the
trap in a flurry of net.'
Sandy waved his arms and
“And now that you are leaving us, Mr. Rigby, I feel
that part of this firm will go with you.”
yelled, the outraged bird-
trapper, slow to realise his new
situation.
“Look here, now, you! ”
“Get out of here, Sandy, or
I’ll phone the police.”
John’s voice unsettled him
with its adolescent unsteadiness
where he wanted authority.
“Ringnecks are protected
birds, and you know it; you’re
trespassing, too, setting up a
trap on our property.”
A slow, uneasy smile of
recognition came over Sandy’s
face ; the face of a man who
is accustomed to being in a
jam.
“Aw, now, I never knew you
at first. Must be a year since
I seen you at the bird show.
You put on a coupler inches,
since then.”
He grinned more easily, his
eyes growing crafty.
“Didn’t your Dad tell you he
was letting me in to catch a
coupler buln-bulns for the bird
show Saturdee?”
“Yair, that’s right,” Ding
stuck in, leaning from the back
of the truck, eager to perjure his
soul; “he tole me and Sandy.
I heard him I did.”
“It’s quite all right,” Sandy
asserted, almost smug, holding
out his hand for the cage.
John gave an unbelieving
laugh. He held the cage behind
his back as if confiscating it.
“You won’t do any more
trapping with this parrot.”
Deep concern slowly dis-
placed the smugness on Sandy's
face. He said plaintively:
“You can’t do that! He’s
mine. Me best caller. Won
first prize at Griffith, and
Wagga, too. I’ve had him two
year and more.”
“You trapped him, I’ll bet.
And that’s illegal.”
Sandy was perplexed. The
town kid watched him anxi-
ously. He scrambled out of the
truck and stood beside Sandy.
“He can’t pinch your caller,
Sanely. We’ll grab him and
take it off of him.”
'"The town kid tensed himself
-*• ready to spring, but Sandy
was full of slow deliberation.
John said sharply to the boy:
“Do you want to add assault-
and-battery to your other
crimes? You’d land quite a
penalty for that.”
It bounced off the kid un-
heeded ; he kept up his belliger-
ant pose until Sandy turned on
him.
“Shut up, you silly fool. Git
back into the truck where I
told you.”
Ding went, grievously disap-
pointed. Sandy turned to

Trade with Japan
[From Canberra]
At the Tokyo talks for re-
negotiation of the Austra-
lian-Japanese Trade Agreement
the Japanese will be much
tougher negotiators this year
than they were in 1957, when
the agreement was first drawn-
up.
In those days Japan was
looking for markets for its
growing industrial potential
and wasn’t too fussy about
conditions la : d down by Aus-
tralia, or anyone else, for that
matter.
Australia, for its part, wasn’t
breaking its neck to negotiate
an agreement, although it
knew the benefits that would
flow from it.
In the interim, the agree-
ment has worked well— better
than expected by either
negotiating party. Japan, to
its credit, has honored its
part admirably by not allow-
ing flooding of the Australian
market with cheap goods to
the detriment of local industry.
Whenever a complaint has
been made about any facet of
the agreement’s operation,
Japan has quickly and effec-
tively taken corrective action.
In the same time, Japan has
now become Australia’s bes
customer for wool, it
valuable outlet for certain
types of Australian wheat, it
interested in our coal, anu
there are strong possible
of a profitable market

buting the car in U.S.
It was hoped to raise the
entire capital in Australia by
public subscription, but, if
necessary, sufficient funds were
available in U.S. The initial
float would be for about
£250,000 to £450,000, depend-
ing on the final capital-cost
estimates. “A prominent Syd-
ney broker has agreed to under-
write the flotation.”
Initial output is expected
to be at the rate of 10,000
ears a year. Production
would commence in 16 to 18
months’ time. Mr. Woodill
claims that during the first three
years the entire output will be
absorbed by the American
West Coast market.
At present America imports
about 75,000 sports - cars a
year. Most of these imports
come from the U.K., but it was
said that Australia could suc-
cessfully compete, having lower
labor- and steel-costs.
Moreover, British cars “had
certain features which were un-
popular with American con-
sumers.” The Wildfire was
specifically designed for the
American sports-car market.
The Wildfire will be almost
completely made in Australia,
but initially some special parts
will be imported from the U.S.
Suitable plant has already been
located.

HOBART
THE OTHER FELLOW'S MIND
The Employable Pensioner
“One of Them” (B. 14/9/ ’6O)
is right. But the chaps who
tell the oldster he shouldn’t be
working at his age are usually
young clerks or personnel offi-
cers ; even clerks in the Com-
monwealth or State Employ-
ment Bureaux. A shake of the
head and a kind smile it is,
usually—as if the youngster
were ashamed or embarrassed.
Pop’s trouble is that he
usually applies at a big indus-
trial concern that merely
“takes-on hands.” The young
personnel officer is instructed
by his chief: “Use your head.
If the chap seems all right take
him on. But no old fellows.
Right?”
In casual trades like the
building-trade and its many
crafts, or in small, battling
concerns, the boss or foreman
takes one good look at the
applicant, decides he can or
cannot do the work and hires
him or not, accordingly. There
are plenty of carpenters and
brickies over 65 at work, but
not many hands of that age in
big concerns or the Govern-
ment.
But the whole Labor move-
ment is indifferent to the age-
ing man. Every day in some
of the large industrial plants a
sixty-fiver faces a group of his
fellow -workers about five
minutes before knock-off; a
staff-man or foreman makes a
neat, one-minute speech and
presents a “Wallet of Notes” —
five ones, usually—the victim
stumbles out some thanks, the
whistle blows, the mob rushes
the bundy and the old boy
shuffles out at the gate. He
doesn’t ring off. He’s finished.
In the early days of the Tabor
movement the “right to work”
was held to be the first prin-
ciple of the “worker’s cause.”
Today the right ceases at 65 —-
inarticulately, irrationally and
immovably. Politically the
pensioner is useful at election-
time: “Ban the Means Test”
and “The Basic Wage for Old
Age” and so on. Both these
demands are impracticable, and
the Labor politician knows it.
That’s why he uses them.
But, in sheer justice, if a
man must be “sacked” at 65
and refused further employ-
ment and if the Labor move-
ment accepts that as a prin-
ciple, then it’s the duty of that
movement to see that the man
SO' denied the right to work is
enabled to live decently as a
free citizen.
This can’t be done on the
present pension. Any Labor
politician who believes it can
is welcome to prove it practic-
ally and publicly.
The need is for a pension
as a proportion of the basic
wage sufficient for a single
person to live on as decently
as an employed person in a
city of high rents and high
prices. If that is practicable,
then the Labor movement
should go to work on it with-
out delay and stop using im-
practicalities as election-
slogans. If it’s not practicable,
then the right to work should
be insisted on and enforced,
irrespective of age.
Many lightning strikes in in-
dustrial plants occur because a
shop-delegate or union-official
has been sacked. He may be
incompetent, indolent and in-
solent ; he may cause trouble
“Aw — I've done about eight years now."
and needless friction between
men and management, and his
men may be well aware of it;
but he must not be sacked. His
job must be safe and his person
immune.
If unions insisted upon the
right to work, irrespective of
age, as resolutely as they pro-
tect their shop-stewards and
delegates a lot of us oldsters
would still be working today—
and our whack of the pension-
fund could be dished out to
those of us who cannot work.

Story of a Road
Four years ago we had a
new house built in a Mel-
bourne suburb. The road was
an old-established one and,
though unmade, was in fair
condition. Periodically the
local council spread cinders
from the gasworks on it. The
biggest snag was a hollow near
the intersection with a main
road. Brickbats were tossed in
there from time to time, but
waste water from adjacent
houses kept it in a bad state.

New Guinea has been much in the national
and international news this year. Australia’s
responsibilities in the territory are becoming more
apparent—to ourselves and to the world.
And the manner in which we carry out our
work in the island above us is going to be a test of
our faith in Australia itself.
It is a big challenge. Excepting Greenland,
most of which is under ice cap, New Guinea is the
largest island on Earth. The eastern half, which
Australia administers in external territory or in
trust, is more than twice the area of Victoria,
three-fifths the size of New South Wales, more
than one-quarter the size of Queensland.
Geographically it is one of the world’s most
difficult countries to master in settlement. Yet
much has been done in the post-war years to
advance the condition of its one-and-three-quarter
million people, divided as they are by many
different languages, and emerging in locally uneven
stages from the primitive.
There has been a very strong investment of
human effort in taking such services as health,
education and agricultural knowledge out from
Administration along the remote tracks that
Government patrol officers walk, or into centres
staffed by self-sacrificing missionaries.
A lot has been won, too, by the encouragement
of technical skills introduced and demonstrated
through European settlement.
The quality of Australia’s work in New Guinea
has been good. It has stood up well to scrutiny
by teams of United Nations observers. But doing
a good job by time-standards of the past will be less
than enough to satisfy the demands of the future.
Australia has a duty now to accelerate the pace
of New Guinea’s physical and social development.
It is more than a matter of bringing the world’s
second largest island to richer production. The
real and ultimate task is to lead the people of New
Guinea up, as soon as possible, to stand strongly
beside us as partners in this Pacific portion of
tomorrow’s world.

Prosecutions, even inquiries,
are launched only for gross
breaches, and I know that
there would be few practi-
tioners whose consciences
would not suffer from an in-
vestigation. This is apparent
from the number of restricted
prescriptions received by the
chemist compared with the
incidence of specified illnesses
in the community.
The drugs restricted to small
quantities are those which are
potentially dangerous ; they
may be expensive as well.
Quoting the reverse example of
a drug which could possibly be
put to harmful use and which
is not severely limited does not
appreciably alter this fact.
“Medic’s” tale of the pre-
scription containing a drug not
on the Government list is an
excellent illustration of my con-
tention that the physician’s
right to prescribe as he thinks
fit is still intact. The pharma-
cist dispensed the prescription
in full; that he failed to charge
the patient merely ranks him
among the greenhorns. A
prescription for bats’-blood or
diamond-dust would similarly
have been filled had stocks
been available —but there’s no
reason why the taxpayer should
be billed for it.— Oscar (Q.).
Building Slums
There’s something about
unspoilt bushland which rouses
the ire, or cupidity, of a small
but influential section of the
community. It’s no time at all
since West Australians had to
stamp hard on a group that
wanted a big slice of King’s
Park (Perth) for an aquatic-
centre ; now it seems they’ve
got to give the same treatment
to a suggestion that a Govern-
ment House should be built
there.
The present Government
House is old and probably
should be replaced; but the
site is central and adequate
and is one of the best in the
city from a residential point
of view. That’s probably the
reason for urging the removal;
the site would be ideal for a
mammoth hotel, which in
no circumstances could be
built in King’s Park.
At the same time, West Aus-
tralians are being warned that,
to make attractive propositions
of suburban transport and the
distribution of electricity and
water they’ve got to cut down
on their open spaces and con-
centrate the metropolitan popu-
lation. In both instances town-
planner Professor Gordon


Stephenson is quoted as the
advocating authority.
Now, Professor Stephenson
is at the top of his profession,
and when he speaks on that
subject he must command
respect. But it’s a different
matter when he and his sup-
porters invade the subject of a
nation’s way of life; their
views are then open to debate
and may carry no more weight
than those of the man-in-the-
street, or in the tenement
house.
The professor has been
quoted—l don’t know how
correctly—as advocating subur-
ban blocks of an eighth-acre
instead of the present quarter-
acre ; and that idea seems to
be behind the suggestion that
suburban “open spaces” must
go-
Well, we’ve already got some
eighth - acre blocks around
Perth, and they’re shunned;
we’ve also got some semi-
detached houses of the type
that would have to be built on
eighth-acre blocks—quite well-
built brick houses, with prob-
ably as much privacy as you’d
find in an average flat. In the
main this type of house is
regarded as approaching slum
conditions, and it’s shunned by
the average suburban family
who want something more than
a roof and four walls.
I’ve spoken with migrants
from the closer-settled cities of
Britain, and they seem to fall
roughly into two groups: those
who long for the crowded con-
ditions they left, where every-
one knew everyone’s business
and where the house or flat
was a place to eat sometimes
and sleep, and where the pub
(they call it club sometimes)
was the centre of social
activity ; and those who wel-
comed the wonderful new free-
dom of a house with a little
space around it. Some of those
in the first group have returned
to England—and then couldn’t
get back here quickly enough.
A feeling of ownership, of
possession, goes with a house
on a quarter-acre block. There
are also such things as a view
somewhat better than a brick
wall, a certain amount of sun-
shine and daylight and a
glimpse of the sky. These
things make for health and a
healthy outlook ; and if having
them means increased costs of
transportation, water and elec-
tricity, then we must pay those
costs, while seeking other ways
of reducing them. There should
be no place in Australian
towns and cities for the rabbit-
warrens of Europe.— Pieter
Nuyts (W.A.).
Deep-draught Problems
Ten years ago an 18,000-ton
tanker was a big ship ; today
the 45,800-ton Caltex Ply-
mouth, biggest yet to come to
Australia, is only medium-size
by world standards. Super-
tankers have mushroomed to
100,000 tons, but their size
greatly restricts their move-
ments. At present there is
insufficient water in the
approaches to any Australian
port to allow them to come
here.
Vacuum Oil’s new terminal
at Hallett’s Cove, on the Gulf
of St. Vincent (S.A.), will over-
come this difficulty, but in the
meantime the annual value of
crude-oil imports is approach-
ing the £ 100-million-mark, and
another £25 million is being
paid in freight!
Maximum draught into Gee-
long (Vic.) is 34ift., permitting
33,000-tonners to call there.
Deepest water through the
entrance to Port Phillip is a
650 ft.-wide gutter carrying a
minimum depth of 45ft. Strong
tides make it necessary for
ships to navigate this channel
at full speed. Lack of positive
data on the scend of a 700 ft-
. deeply - laden tanker
passing through such turbulent
waters as the Rip at a speed
of 16 knots has necessitated
a restriction to 36ft. on the
draught of ships that can enter
with an adequate degree of
safety. Tankers are the only
ships coming at this draught.
It was the establishment of
the Shell refinery at Corio that
brought about the deepening
of the Geelong channels, cost
being offset by a surcharge on
freight. This probably
prompted Vacuum Oil to seek
facilities for the deepest ships
that could enter Port Phillip
Heads to discharge cargoes
into their Altona refinery.

At draughts of 32ft. they will
have a meagre 2ft. of water
under their keels at low water,
not much for such large and
valuable ships! Their move-
ments are likely to be restricted
by the often unpredictable
tidal rise in Port Phillip Bay.
Passenger-liners will always
be on tight timetables and not
at all amenable to restrictions.
But at the bottom of Port Mel-
bourne channel is a layer of
hard clay, almost rocklike in
texture. It is difficult and ex-
pensive to dredge.
Carrying little or no freight
on which to impose a surcharge,
large modern liners are going
to be at a disadvantage when
competing against smaller ships
that don’t need the deeper
channel if passengers’ fares are
to be levied.

ing?—Look-out (Vic.).

added to the dam, the under-

compressed back towards its
original position, so that the
dam itself slowly settled down-

There were two other move-
ments as well. As the pressure
of water has built up against
the wall it has moved slowly
forward to a precalculated
position—the total pressure
behind it when full is
1,000,000 tons.
Also, as the area behind
the dam has filled towards its
full capacity of 460,000-million
gallons the actual weight on
the ground has climbed
towards 2000-million tons,
depressing the river-bed and
causing a slight tilting of the
dam itself.
These three movements are
of vital concern to the engi-
neers on the job, who go to
almost fantastic lengths to
measure them to the ’nth
degree of accuracy.

It records the Navy’s depth-
charges off the coast as

A nother factor which had
to be pretty accurately
measured during construction
of the dam was flooding.
After having laid the job out
so nicely, Mother Nature
perversely sent some awesome
torrents roaring down the
Warragamba Gorge as though
trying to tear the concrete
obstruction out of its throat.
Before work on the dam
could start the river had to be
turned aside, and this was done
by driving an 1800 ft. tunnel,
14ft. high by 18ft. wide, along
the east bank and diverting the
river into it.
Economics determined the
size of the tunnel. Records
back into the last century
indicated that about three
major floods a year could be
expected down the river, and
it was calculated to be cheaper
to let these go over the work-
ings and suspend operations
than to make the tunnel large
enough to accommodate them.
The flood-warning arrange-
ment was quite an elaborate
complex. From strategic points
throughout the 3383 square-
mile catchment-area, post-
masters, farmers and others,
including the manager at
Jenolan Caves, flashed in
immediate reports on rainfall
to the flood-control centre
perched high above the site of
the dam. Closer in, automatic
flood-warning stations sig-
nalled river-heights on the
Cox’s, the Wollondilly, the
junction of both with the
Warragamba and on Monkey
Creek, a Warragamba tribu-
tary.
The men at the dam worked
—sometimes feverishly— to sift
this information and assess
possibilities, probabilities and
certainties. Heavy falls at,
say, Goulburn and Katoomba
on the same day could be all
right—the Katoomba fall
could be through and gone
in 24 hours, whereas the water
from Goulburn would arrive
a day later. But if it rained
at Goulburir yesterday and:
Katoomba today, the com-
bined falls could arrive at the
dam at the same time.
Similarly with the automatic
flood-warning stations —a rise
in the Cox’s would reach the
dam within five hours ; on the
Wollondilly within eight
hours ; on the junction at the
head of the Warragamba
within 2\ hours. When the
level at the junction indicated
that the flow exceeded the
capacity of the diversion-
tunnel it was almost certain
that water would come over
the top.

Beef-cattle numbered 676

dairy-section there were 1526
(1376 last year).
In the dual-purpose breeds
there was a fine showing of
Dairy Shorthorns, but Red
“ That's grounds for divorce , Mary.”
Polls were disappointing in
numbers, though good in
quality.
It was a year in which senior
bulls generally held their own
against junior contenders for
the grand-championships, and
once again few of the last-year
junior-champions figured in the
senior placings.
The ban on importing cattle
because of blue-tongue disease
has not yet shown any adverse
effect in the quality of our
Show cattle, and this year’s
Melbourne Royal proved that
local breeders have so far been
able to meet the challenge
posed by the ban.
The R.A.S. of Victoria is
to be commended on its
instruction to judges about
watching for over-fat beasts.
In other years two attendants
have sometimes been needed to
help round the show-ring some
entries so fat that they could
hardly walk. This year
breeders rose to the occasion,
and over-fat entries were rare.
Particular interest was added
by the appearances of two
overseas judges: Gerald Ran-
kin, of West Drums, Brechin,
Angus (Scotland), and Edward
Jackson, of Newbiggin House,
Stainton, Penrith, Cumberland
(Eng.).
Gerald Rankin is inter-
nationally known as a judge of
beef-cattle, while Jackson, who
has a fine stud of Devons and
Dairy Shorthorns at New-
biggin House, is interested in
crossing Beef Shorthorns with
Ayrshires, producing both
dairy-cattle and culls for beef.
He believes the Shorthorn bull
is best suited for this purpose.
Rankin, who judged Short-
horns, Poll Shorthorns and
Angus, warned that we could
be undermining our beef-
industry if the ban on the
importation of livestock is
allowed to remain. He said he
couldn’t understand why Aus-
tralia had not set the best scien-
tific brains in the world to
study blue-tongue, adding that
study of quarantine methods
and treatment might lead to a
safe way of easing the ban
without endangering the sheep-
industry.
Beef, he said, could possibly
become more important than
wool to Australia, taking into
account the development of
synthetic fibres and the rise of
Russia’s sheep-population. In
his opinion some of Australia’s
beef-producers, particularly in
the north, did not seem to
recognise that evenness of
quality was necessary to assure
meat-distributers a steady de-
mand from housewives n

Boorook, Mortlake, from the
grand-championship for the
first time in five years. It’s the
first time in the history of
Melbourne Royal that a South
Australian has won the grand-
championship in the section.
The judge was R. M.
Reynolds, of Norwin (Q.), who
described the section, as gener-
ally outstanding, with younger
cattle equal to anything he had
judged at any show in Aus-
tralia. He praised the young
bulls for their growth, quality
and evenness of type and had
some good words to say for
the manner in which they were
brought-out. It’s an interesting
follow-on from the remarks of
last year’s judge, S. B.
Reynolds, of Rosalie Plains
(Q.), who commented then on
the improvement being shown
in the breed.
Jim Allen made a bid for
success wth his senior-cham-
pion, South Boorook Prin-
chester, which had wonderful
character, topline, depth and
scale but lacked the smooth-
ness over the shoulders of the
junior- and grand-champion.
He also exhibited the reserve
junior-champion, South Boo-
rook Landore.
Reserve senior - champion
was Ascot Ambassador, shown
by C. R. Malseed, of Ascot,
Dartmoor.
In the female division of the
Herefords R, L. McEachern’s
entry, Ardno Gorisands 21st,
took the senior- and grand-
championships. Silverton Per-
sistence 3rd gained reserve
senior-championship for the
Hayward team.
Other class-winners were
F. A. Mclntyre, of Heather
Brae, Digby, and W. Peatt
Pty., Ltd., of Bellwyn Estate,
Coleraine.
Shorthorns
Gerald Rankin said that this
year’s exhibit was far above
what had been shown in this
section when he judged at the
1955 Royal Sydney Show.
There were far more top cattle
displayed, and he was pleased
to see that the breeders were
going for more strength and
size; heads, which had previ-
ously been weak in Australian
Shorthorn bulls, had improved
considerably. He was also im-
pressed with the quality of the
females.

the outstanding sire in Scot-
land), which sired the winners
of four classes in the last Perth

Rankin was pleasantly sur-
prised to find after the judging
that the two bulls were by his
own top sire.
The Starritt team were show-
ing the first of the progeny of
their new top sire, Chapelton
Bright Fashion, one of whose
daughters, Kelso Fragrance,
won the female junior- and
grand-championships. She was
a white heifer, short-legged,
thick, wide, standing up well
on her feet, with a sweet head,
a finely set tail and a creamy
white coat. Chapelton Bright
Fashion also had three other
males and two females in the
awards.
Junior-champion bull, shown
by C. P. Fairbairn and Co., of
Woomargama Station, via
Albury (N.S.W.), was Woomar-
gama Belman by Calrossie
Independence. Two other sons
of this sire gained awards.
Commenting on the reserve
junior-champion bull, Round
Hill Euston, owned by Round
Hill, Pty., Ltd., of Culcairn
(N.S.W.), Rankin said he had
great promise and could be
hard to beat by the time the
next Sydney Royal came
around.
The Greenwich Stud of
Kyalla Pty., Ltd., of Towrang
(N.S.W.), was a strong con-
tender for the female classes.
Greenwich Rosebud Keep-
sake, which was senior-
champion, and Greenwich
Mina Lady, the reserve
junior-champion, were both
by Greenwich Iron Monarch,
junior-champion and cham-
pion at Melbourne Royal in
1957.
Other award-winners were
Williamson Bros., of Lochin-
var, Carisbrook, who were
successful last year with the
junior- and grand-champion
bulls; Frank Hood, of
Kywa n n a, via Albury
(N.S.W.), and Sir Rupert

REPORT FROM CROHAMHURST
(29/9/’60)
Queensland’s rainfall is likely to be light and mainly
below normal in October, apart from isolated moderate
falls and storm-rains in the middle of the month. There
should be good rains in many areas during November, with
best falls along the South Coast, on the Darling Downs,
and about the Maranoa and Warrego. Light rain is probable
in the central coastal, Peninsula, north-western and far-
western districts.
In N.S.W. there should be moderate rains in coastal
districts and on the tablelands during October, with lighter
falls elsewhere. However, good rains are likely in November,
with best falls along the North Coast, on the Northern
Tablelands, and North-western Slopes and neighboring
plains. Apart from g*ood rains in the northern areas, rain-
fall will probably be patchy during December.
Victoria should have light to moderate patchy rains
in October, although better falls are likely in much of the
State during November, especially in the north country and
central division.
Rainfall will probably be light and patchy in South
Australia during October, apart from moderate falls in part
'of the central agricultural areas and south-eastern districts.
In Western Australia moderately good rains are prob-
able in the south-west agricultural areas during October,
but falls may be light in the s.-w. central north and poor
elsewhere.

Devons were judged by
A. J. F. Gibson, of Elsmore
(N.S.W.). Because of the
scratching of the Gibraltar and
Lister teams, the field con-
sisted only of entries from
The Hill Stud (A. A. Laidlaw,
of/Ararat), but judge Gibson
said the two grand-champions
would have been very good
specimens of the breed in any
company.
Senior- and grand-champion
bul], Havtlah Briton sth, was
junior-champion at Sydney,
and senior- and grand-cham-
pion at Adelaide.
Grand-champion cow, Whis-
loca Jenny 86th, had taken
similar honors at both Sydney
and Adelaide Shows.
Laidlaw must now be used
to showing his team in small
fields, but he had evidently
listened to 1959 adjudicator
J S. Anderson, who had said
that, while the top animals
were good, the display suffered
because preparation and

Champion bull was King

cow was the heifer Risdon

Ranch Stud, Bowral (N.S.W.).
Dual-Purpose Breeds
The Willow Park Stud of
Atkinson Brothers, at Swan
Hill, once again put in a strong
showing of Dairy Shorthorns
and gained the major honors.
Seven-year-old Willow Park
Mossrose was grand-champion
cow for the third year in
succession. They took the
bull championship with Theale
Emperor 3rd (champion in
1959). This entry headed a
class of eight bulls in which
the Atkinson Brothers also
won second place with Orma
Wild Stockman.
Junior-champion was Willow
Park Gay Lord 81st, by Kelm-
scott Gay Lord 73rd, which
was also reserve senior-cham-
pion. Junior-champion and
reserve senior - champion
female was Green Meadows
Countess Bth.
Red Polls were judged by
A. R. Beggs, of Buln Gherin,
Beaufort (Vic.).
The Plymouth Stud of
Wilson G. J. Beer and Sons,
Nanneela South, had the
champion and junior-champion
bulls, the champion and
reserve-champion cows, and
the junior - champion and
reserve junior - champion
heifers.
Outstanding cow was
Plymouth Chicory, which had
also been champion at Sydney
and Adelaide. Reserve cham-
pion was Plymouth Dorcas,
shown dry. Junior-champion
heifer was Plymouth Maiden.
The championship amongst
the bulls was taken by Glen-
doon Mambo, which won last
year. Plymouth Barrister was
junior-champion and reserve
senior-champion.
Dairy-cattle
Of the dairy-cattle displayed,
595 were Jerseys. There were
record fields for Guernseys
and Friesians (268 and 289
respectively), while Ayrshires
had 211 entries (172 last year)
and Australian Illawarra
Shorthorns went up from 121
to 163.
The award for champion
dairy-cow of all breeds went
to Yeronga Mayfair 3rd, a
Jersey which could only gain
the reserve championship in
its own section, but had
proved its worth earlier by
winning four championships
in the South Australian

Then he saw the big, bear-
like back of Sandy Ferris
crouched over a cage, with
animated, gaping spectator
pressing in on him from bot i
sides ; Sandy’s voice, when bit
of it came to him, soundin
boastful; Ding standing by
boyishly asserting his co
proprietorship.
As if he could feel John’
eyes on his back, Sandy
turned, and the smirk o ;
triumph fell off his face. He
moved guiltily to obscure hi
exhibit, but the movemen
disturbed the captive, which
flung itself round the cage
battering itself mercilessly on
the mesh. It was green anc
red and yellow.
The next moment John was
at the cage. Roughly he
pushed Sandy aside ; saw tha
it was indeed a swift-flying
lorikeet —bedraggled and fret-
ting in the terrible dejection of
its first day’s captivity.
He wrenched open the cage
door and took out the lorikeet
while Sandy watched, awed by
his demoniac purposefulness.
He made for the entrance of
the hall with Sandy following.
Some female voices
querulously demanded explana-
tions, but neither John nor
Sandy regarded them. When
they passed through the door,
most of the spectators surged
out after them, on to the
pavement, into the street,
where John, with a great
excited constriction round his
heart, flung the lorikeet high
into the air.
For a moment it fell, as if
it could never dare trust its
wings again. Then its wild
instincts reasserted themselves ;
it thrust powerfully at the air
with its wings, and was borne
off in a swift, near-vertical
flight, emitting as it rose
hysterical flight-calls: “Zit,
zit!”
John watched it until it
disappeared, heedless of the
sensation among the spec-
tators. When he did look
down, the only person he
noticed was Sandy, his eyes
slowly descending from fol-
lowing the lorikeet, too. Ding
was pulling indignantly at
Sandy’s arm.
“Dong him, Sandy; you
dong him! Go on! ”
But Sandy brushed Ding
away with a careless gesture.
He was looking in John’s eyes
with perfect undersanding;
even a reluctant approval.
ZJ\nce a flood was certain the
site of the dam had to
be cleared. There could be up
to £250,000-worth of equip-
ment in the river-bed and up
to eight hours needed to get
d out - .
By mischance, or some un-
explained cussed ness of
nature, floods seemed to have
a habit of coming at week-
ends, and at night, and it was
often necessary to go from
house to house gathering the
riggers and dogmen, the cable-
way drivers, the bellmen and
drivers of mechanical plant ,
Burragorang; today the waters cover it.
who were necessary to get all
that equipment out of the
way of the flood.
The sheds and other struc-
tures in the river-bed were all
built on bearers with cables
looped over the roof so that
they could be readily lifted up
by the big cableways spanning
the site. Diamond-drill equip-
ment, pumps and other gear
went out the same way.
Big stuff, such as the 80-ton
excavator-shovel, could crawl
out on its own, sometimes
helped along by bulldozers.
There was something
especially dramatic working
under the glare of floodlights
at night to get the equipment
out and being very much
aware of the forces gathering
in the darkness up-river, par-
ticularly if you’d heard the
late Jerry Milne’s story of
how, in 1942, on a still
summer night with neither
wind nor rain, he heard a
rushing and roaring coming
down the gorge and saw it
materialise into a 30ft. wall of
black water.
In daylight, too, of course,
rain a hundred miles away
can send down a flood that
hits the dam in broad, clear
sunlight.
A tremendous amount de-
pended on the flood-control
officers busily sifting their in-
formation, while, like ants far
below them, men worked in the
river-bed.
The likelihood of a flood
had to be very accurately
judged—it would have been
highly uneconomic to have
cleared the site only on proba-
bility. They worked it even
finer/than that. Sometimes,
when the lower workings were
flooded, they could estimate
the rise of the water and get
in a few hours concreting on
higher levels before these were
submerged.
Some idea of the vagaries
of the Warragamba can be
gauged from the fact that, on
past rainfall-records, it could
fill the dam (460,000-million
gallons) in five days—or it
could take eight years.
In 24 hours the lowest point
of the excavations could be
covered by 140 ft. of rushing
water, rising to 180 ft. in two
days.
In the biggest flood during
construction 225,000 cubic-
feet of water per second went
down the river—121,000-
million gallons a day.
It is hard to reconstruct or
visualise the effect of the rush-
ing water with its cargo of
trees, dead cattle and other
debris. Possibly it is best
crystallised in a small and
simple incident. The engineer
is slowly working his way up
ahead of the flood, checking
to see that everything has
been cleared from the water’s
reach. Just above the rising
water-level he rings the office
and reports. Then:
“I ripped the phone off the
wall, stuck it under my arm
and went on up the hill.”

How are eucalypts classified ?
There are approximately 500
varieties of eucalypts, and this
number in itself precludes a satis-
factory scientific method of classi-
fication. Whatever is used as a
standard will be found to apply
not to a single species but to a
group. Leaves, bark, fruit, anthers
(pollen-sac) and oils have been
used as distinguishing bases for
various classification systems, but
they have not proved satisfactory
as each species has a distinctiveness
which is a product of many
features. To limit varieties, rather
than species, grouping according
to anthers is a practical possi-
bility, but to split-up the varieties
according to anthers would make
the classification too unwieldy.
As a popular and general means
of dividing the varieties, bark is
used as a basis. Thus there are
the broad groups of smooth-
barked eucalypts (the gums); scaly-
barked (bloodwoods, which pre-
dominate in the tropical zones);
scaly to sub-fibrous (boxes, often
easily distinguished amongst them-
selves by the color of the bark);
fibrous stringybarks and pepper-
mints, a diverse classification but
one whose members are usually
found in the south-east of Aus-
tralia) ; and finally the furrowed-
barks (ironbarks). Once such a
general classification as this is left
behind many difficulties arise, as
can be seen from the correspond-
ence-wars in The Bulletin's
“Aboriginalities” columns, where
grouping according to timbers
results in cross-purposes.

How is the American card-game
called pinochle played ?
It is difficult to give more than
the briefest description of pinochle,
for not only has it as many rules
as contract bridge and, like bridge,
as many ways of playing a hand
as there are hands in a game, but
there are also as many variations
of the game as there are of rummy.
One may play two-handed pinochle,
three-handed pinochle, four-handed
pinochle, partnership pinochle,
partnership pinochle with a widow,
and so on.
But whichever game is played
there is a standard pinochle pack,
consisting of 48 cards, two of each
suit of ace, 10, king, queen, jack,
9 (ranking in that order). Taking
two-handed as a basis, here is the
play:
Twelve cards each are dealt,
four at a time. The next card is
placed face-up on the table, and
the rest of the stock goes face-down
beside it. The face-card becomes
trumps for the hand. The players
then play for tricks, for which they
score points, and having won a
trick a player is entitled to meld.
A meld is a combination of cards
gaining a certain points score, as
in rummy games, or canasta.
Examples: king and queen of a
suit (a marriage); four kings of
different suits (80 kings); the nine
of trumps (the deece). The meld
is still considered part of the
player’s hand. After each trick
and meld both players take another
card from the stock.
Having gone through the stock
the players play the last 12 cards
as straight tricks, which differ
from bridge in that the following
player must play a trump if he
has one. When these tricks are
exhausted the hand ends. The
game is played to a 1000 points.
Brief Answers
J.C.: In his defence it must
be said that the only crime
he was ever convicted of was,
rather like Capone, that of tax-
evasion ... .K.P.: In Scots Law the
term homologation means the
giving of assent to a deed which
becomes binding despite any
defects in the instrument. A
common instance occurs where a
person capable of consenting
approves a deed granted by him
at a time when he was legally
incapable of giving assent to its
terms; e.g., by a minor on his
attaining majority in respect of a
grant made during minority with-
out the consent of his curator.
To be valid, homologation must
be an act from which it can be
clearly inferred that the person
homologating both knew and
approved the contents of the
instrument M.D.C.: You may
have him confused with John
Anderson Hartley, South Australian
educationist. Hartley became
headmaster of Prince Alfred Col-
lege, Adelaide, in 1871, resigned
in 1875 to become president of the
Council of Education, later became
Inspector-General of Schools and
permanent head of the South Aus-
tralian Education Department....

More Christmas Pops
Borne on the current flood
of Yuletide music come two
from R.C.A. One, Christmas
with Gisele (L 10919), has the
Canadian songstress Gisele
Mackenzie putting her light
soprano to the delineation of
songs of moods both grave and
gay, and doing it all very
pleasantly. Among the
songs are such popular ones
as “White Christmas,” “Rudolf
the Red-Nosed Reindeer,” “The
Christmas Song,” and others
both new and old. The other is
Christmas Party (L 16247) in,
which Arthur Fiedler and the
Boston Pops Orchestra partly
cover the same ground, break-
ing away with “Dance of the
Sugar-Plum Fairies” from the
“Nutcracker Suite” and the
Dream Music from “Hansel
and Gretel.” All in all, good
fare to top-off the turkey and
the duff.
Christmas With Connif (KLP
824) is Coronet’s entry in the
same field. There’s been a
spot of parallel thinking here ;
seven of the dozen numbers
presented in dance-time by Ray
Connif and his Singers are also
on the Esquival-Ray Martin
menu, released last week. For
the rest, Connif goes back to
traditional Christmas fare—
“ Jingle Bells,” “Silver Bells,”
“Sleigh Ride,” and “Green-
sleeves.”
❖ ❖ ❖
Percy Again
Another Coronet platter,
Percy Faith’s Greatest Hits
(KLP 873), gives this conductor,
in the dozen pieces he has put
together, the maximum oppor-
tunity for his celebrated strings
to sing—and they do it, sump-
tuously. Syncopation is his
speciality, and he gives the
treatment with hoof - teasing
insistence to such offerings as
“Jamaican Rhumba,” “Tropical
Meringue,” “Delicado,” “The
Syncopated Clock,” “Rain in
Spain,” etc.
Contemporary Ballet
Virility of action is in-
herent in almost every bar of
the suites taken from the
“Gayeneh” and “Masquerade”
ballets of Khachaturian and
Kabalevsky’s “The Comedi-
ans.” The music, strongly
rhythmic, is also vividly
colored, as befits that of Orien-
tal Russia. The title, Sabre
Dance , given to a Capitol disk
(P 8503), covers only that short
spectacular episode from
“Gayeneh.” But ballet-music
of much greater attraction
occurs throughout the same
composer’s “Masquerade” and
the Kabalevsky piece. Alfred
Newman directs the Hollywood
Bowl Orchestra, whose playing
is verveful, piquant and, where
the dancing is given over to
primitive warriors, tumultuous.

The Latin-American Lilt
At the drop of a hat
Edmondo Ros will subject
music of every kind to banana-
republic treatment —he has
even bent the dignities of grand-
opera into terms of samba,
bolero, mamba and guaracha.
On a Decca mono, Porgy and
Bess — Showboat (LK 4340), he
and his orchestra give the
works to all the best-known
tunes from the Gershwin and
Jerome Kern scores. All
slickly done, with quite a weird
array of instruments pressed
into service. For those who
like their folk-opera neat, this
is out; but Ros-fanciers who
can’t keep their feet still when
Edmondo wields the little stick,
will find this one irresistible.

Victor Herbert
To a long list of albums
featuring George Melachrino
and his orchestra R.C.A. have
added The Music of Victor
Herbert (L 10926), a collection
of the lilting songs that put the
Irish-born American musician
in the front rank of musical-
comedy composers for nearly
30 years For two of the songs
Melachrino goes back to an
1898 Broadway success, “The
Fortune Teller”; these are
“G ip s y Love Song,” and
“Romany Life.” To the present
generation Herbert is best
known through the film version
of the frequently revived
“Naughty Marietta.” That
show contributes three items to
the collection: “I’m Falling in
Love With Someone,” “Italian
Street Song” and (of course)
“Ah! Sweet Mystery of Life.”
Others, from shows mostly
forgotten, include “In Old New
York,” “Thine Alone” and the
haunting waltz-number “Kiss
Me Again.”
Vintage Lombardo
Another Camden “paper-
back” is An Evening with Guy
Lombardo (CAM 42). It’s not
exactly a recent evening;
neither last week nor last year.
In fact, the most recent item on
a well-chosen programme was
recorded in February, 1938 ;
the oldest —two items from
“Porgy and Bess” —in Decem-
ber, 1935. That may seem a
long time ago, but Lombardo
and his Royal Canadians had
years and years of success
behind them even then—they
staged a Canadian invasion of
the U.S. in 1923 and 37 years
later they still seem to be able
to give their audiences the sort
of music they want to hear.
The present collection is from
the pick of their recordings
during the three years 1935-38
and most of the numbers still
bob-up in dance- or dinner-
music programmes today.
Vocals are supplied as required
by Guy’s brothers Carmen and
Lebert.

SYDNEY
This was a busy and lively week for
Sydney, with a race-carnival, the fashion-
able ball, art-shows and garden-displays.
Every now and again one would run into
the Waratah Festival, if one happened
to be in the right places (King’s Cross
and Hyde Park seemed to provide more
merry-go-rounds and marching girls than
anywhere else). There were waratahs at
every turn, however, more magnificent
than ever before, and there is a report
that research is being done into the grow-
ing of these splendid flowers which may
result in our being, able to have just as
many as we wish. Here’s hoping!

The Black and White Ball once more
lived up to its reputation for magnificent
decor. Grecian columns, plumed with
white ostrich-feathers at the crown and
linked by swathes of pink taffeta, sur-
rounded the dance-floor. The tables
glowed in the light of hundreds of shaded
candles in black metal holders, five
papier-mache doves (X.O.S. and pink-
spangled) were suspended from the ceil-
ing, and in the foyer a dozen white fan-
tail pigeons flew around a high pink cage
decorated by white camellias. It was all
very dramatic, though the muted lighting,
while kind to the complexion, did not
display the dresses over-well. Still, you
can’t have everything.
Lady Woodward, who was guest-of-
honor with the Governor, Sir Eric Wood-
ward, wore olive-green brocade and
received a bouquet presented by Prue
Osborne. There was a great deal of white
chiffon worn, including the lovely
swathed dress chosen by the president,
Mrs. Marcel Dekyvere, with its silver-
embroidered stole floating from the
shoulders at the back. Another to choose
chiffon was Mrs. Reg Gaskill, who won
first prize for the best-dressed married
woman. Other prizewinners were Mrs.
Arthur Gollan, Mrs. Kenneth Hunter-
Kerr, Jane Hill, Eileen Donohoe and
Robin Lanach. White was the favorite
choice of the vast majority of the
dancers, a small percentage wearing black,
and about an equal number in pastel-
shades. There were about 1200 at the
ball.

Did you know that 78 per cent, of
children in N.S.W. are educated in the
State schools, 20 per cent, in Catholic
schools and only 2 per cent, in other
schools? Most of the guests at the
luncheon of the American Women’s Club,
held at Mark Foy’s during the week, were
surprised at the 2 per cent, figure, but
the speaker who gave the figures was Dr.
H. S. Wyndham, Director of Education
in this State, and he should know. Dr.
Wyndham was introduced by Mrs. Rush
Clark, and Mrs. Ken McCabe presided
at the luncheon. Mrs. F. N. Andrews,
from Palmerston North (N.Z.), was the
guest of Mrs. Robert Bradley, and Mrs.
C. L. Rich the guest of Mrs. J. M.
Mackellar. A great deal of interest was
shown in the comparison between Aus-
tralian and American methods of educa-
tion mentioned by Dr. Wyndham, one of
the most striking being that here we tend
to treat boys and girls as boys and girls
and not as potential adults, which is
more the American trend.
Charming Desmonde Downing, who
was designer for the A.B.C.’s TV-
production of “Richard II,” is one of the
few women in Australia to make this
work her profession. Already well known
as a designer for theatrical productions,
including “Dark of the Moon” at the In-
dependent, “The Piccadilly Bushman,”
“Ned Kelly" and many others, she
found her way to TV-work through
experience as assistant-art-director to
the “Long John Silver” film-unit.
It is work that women are some-
times timorous of undertaking, for
it needs not only artistic ability but a
good knowledge of the practical possi-
bilities of one’s ideas. For “Richard II,”
for instance, there was three months’
solid work needed, not only for historical
accuracy in costume and setting but also
in the designing of swords, pavilions,
rocks, shields and suits of armor, not to
mention the prime necessity of making
provision for cameras and equipment
being concealed in turrets, etc. Miss
Downing studied art before going into
theatrical work, and is one of a family
of four girls, all interested in the arts in
one form or another. (Her sister,
Brownie Downing, is well known for
her delightful pictures of aboriginal
children, and has just had her book,
“Tinker,” published). Her mother is Mrs.
V. Downing, of Balgowlah. Photo by

There were lots of art-shows round
town this week, mostly stressing the Aus-
tralian note for the Waratah Festival. At
the National Gallery the Russell Drys-
dales were gathered together, some of
which the artist himself had forgotten he
had painted. At the new Wales House
Gallery aspects of Australian life were
depicted by leading artists. “Convict
Escaping,” by Sidney Nolan, was the first
to greet the eye, but further on one
could see happier occupations: bate
bathing, boaters boating, prawuers
prawning, boys drawing pictures, miners
mining, planes landing, etc. There was
also Circular Quay, Taronga Park and
Moody’s Pub. All aspects of Australian
life, and very interesting at that.

A cocktail-party held in the Savoy
Plaza Hotel was in honor of the 23 young
members of the cast of “West Side Story.”
The youngest, 16-year-old Suzanne
Charny, of Brooklyn, New York, who is
still a schoolgirl, has already appeared in
“Carousel,” “Kiss Me Kate,” and “Peer
Gynt.” Wendy Wearing, who will play
the part of a modern-day Juliet in
“West Side Story,” was wearing the gold
kangaroo-tiepin, given her as a farewell
gift from Australian actress Joy Nicholls
with whom she played in the Pulitzer
Prize-winning play “Fiorello.” The only
Australian in the cast, Dallas Renie, is
the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. A. J.
Renie, of Newcastle, and is married to
Rene Paul, whom she met while he was
appearing in the Australian production
of “Call Me Madam.” They have a five-
year-old daughter, Jacqueline, who has
come to Australia with her mother.
Other girls in the cast are Mercedes
Ellington (a granddaughter of the
famous “Duke” Ellington), Robin Miller,
Arlene Woods, Diane Rivers and Margot
De Barr. “West Side Story” opens at
the Princess on October 29.

Among flourishing suburban repertory
companies is that of Mitcham, whose
latest production is Thornton Wilder’s
“Our Town,” staged under the direction
of Max Grant. The opening night’s
audience included the Mayor and
Mayoress of Nunawading, Cr. and Mrs.
T. Fatchwell; Cr. and Mrs. Riddell; Cr.

for relevant quotations and informa-
tion, and the narrowing of the theme
does give a clear focus on the novels.
One does not know whether to be
chiefly grateful for Oliver’s patient,
sympathetic but never uncritical sur-
vey of the earlier novels —their virtues
of humanity and social comedy, their
weaknesses in construction and in the
characterisation of the women in their
love-affairs—or for his eventual
enthusiastic arrival at Forster’s solitary
masterpiece, “A Passage to India”; but
the present reviewer, for one, is always
glad to get to India. “A Passage” is a
novel of inexhaustible fascination,
whether read simply for its curious
story and the portrait of Aziz; or as an
“image” of life almost in the Conradian
manner, where the most that can be
said of the best of men is that they
are “dwarfs shaking hands” under the
enormous dome of the sky; or, as
Oliver implies, as the best picture of the
British in India ever written and a
prophecy of the end of British rule
which grows all the more impressive
as it grows “out-of-date.” It is, in its
way, as timeless as Gibbon’s “Decline
and Fall” —an extraordinary achieve-
ment in the novel.
It would be harrowing to have to
argue about such a book; Oliver offers
the enthusiast, instead, the pleasures
of agreement and illumination: whether
in his doubts about the full credibility
of the incident in the Marabar Caves—
Oliver is probably right when he main-
tains that Forster himself didn’t really
know what had happened—or in his
strictures on the superb piece of sym-
bolic writing at the end when the moun-
tains themselves separate the British
and the Indians (it is sleight-of-hand,
but it remains superb); or in his appre-
ciation, with Lionel Trilling, of the
curious and haunting repetition of
sounds, images, words and incidents
which makes the novel seem con-
structed like “music” or, one might
add, like poetry. There is a similar
effect, though not so elaborate and
intricate, in Conrad’s “Heart of Dark-
ness”; and it is the sort of thing that
can only happen when a work of art,
however blindly the author approaches
it, arrives in his mind as a perfect unity,
every one of its separate strands, even
its verbal music, blended into a
harmonious whole.
It is difficult fully to agree with
Oliver that the reason why Forster has
written no further novels since “A
Passage to India” is that
The novel-form, he is convinced,
just will not hold modern life entire
not, at any rate, if it is to remain
formally beautiful.
The theory may fit in well enough with
some of Forster’s own remarks, and
there may be something in it in the
sense that Forster has found the
modern world too vast and complex to
cope with since he retired to Cam-
bridge; but novelists do not thus coldly
and deliberately decide not to write any
more novels. This reviewer would be
more inclined to say that Forster’s
journeys to India lifted him beyond
himself, or, more kindly, aroused his
powers to the full; moved him in a way
that life never moved him before or
afterwards. It is a case, surely, very
much like that of the war-novelists and
war-poets who so often, stirred by
tremendous experience, write only one
good book; and it was, incidentally,
something rather like a war that
Forster was writing about.
For that reason, as well as for the
lively scenes in Italy in some of the
earlier novels, one can hardly agree
that “Forster is not the kind of novelist
who, like Ernest Hemingway, needs to
go in search of his material or lead
an active life in order to write about
it.” Going in search of his material,
consciously or unconsciously, gave him
his masterpiece. What further travels
might have given him—new master-
pieces, or mere repetition—is an
interesting, if futile, speculation.
Simply because there is no proving
them—we would need to know what
makes an author write, before we can
guess what makes him stop writing—
one always argue about theories;
but this is really an excellent little book
about Forster, equally impressive in its
marshalling of many opinions and in
the lucidity and temperateness with
which Oliver steers his way through
them. It is published by the M p ik

A NOTION OF THE GOOD LIFE
All I shall ask of the powers-that-be
For certain trifling jobs well done
Is a modest sort of annuity
Paid monthly on the dot.
All I ask of the devious logic
That plots our lives in jagged curves
Is a fibro shack on an ocean beach
With a tall, shaggy hill to climb nearby
And look out towards Tasmania.
And all I demand of society
Is a general store ten miles away, and a
pub,
With two dozen bottles of golden ale
Delivered every Monday.
Then 1 could nod over Proust in the
sun,
A wrinkled old man reflecting with
pleasure
That subdivisions were banned.

In adding the two steamy
Stephensons - George and R«£
Stephenson the Railway Rev ohl(
(Longmans)— to his biographies!
Brunei and Telford, L. T q r °|
has turned to literary gold 'again thl
coal and iron of the Industrial Re Vo lu
tion.
George Stephenson was a brakei™
working the stationary steam-engine
which lowered and raised miners and
coal in Northumberland coalpits, ft
was his study of steam-engines which
enabled him to begin, in 1814, becom-
ing the “Father of the Locomotive”
which had already been invented by
Trevithick in 1805. Trevithick's!
“Gateshead,” after being tested, was
found too heavy for the colliery-rails il
was invented for, and was converted
to a stationary engine, but many otheii
steam-engines had been built before
Stephenson got going, notably tie
Blenkinsop-Murry of 1812.
No plans exist of the first Stephen
son engine, Blucher. Its two cylinder!
were set at the top and in each end
of the boiler, and their cross-head pis-
tons worked crankshafts geared to the
back and front axles instead of a
ratchet-wheel. The main innovator
of the Blucher was that its wheels were
flanged, enabling it to work on edge;
rails instead of the flanged rails whici
had been used up to then. . 1
Boilers being elementary in those
days, the steam-pressure was so poor
that when James Stephenson, George’s
brother, was driving Blucher past his
home and it came practically to a
standstill he yelled to his wife: “Come
away, Jinnie, and put your shoulder to
her,” and she did, and the train
lumbered off. A way of increasing the
heat under boilers was to blow the
used steam from the cylinders ou
through the smokestack; but Stephen'
son was always reluctant to do this
because this high-power draught tenae
to drag the fire right out of the stack
and because it created a smo “ e '? ;

Jijli 0 er con t r act with a London
sof o ’ 0 re-open the Spanish
an a Ana. The romance of
this wildcat expedition, the drunken
miners roistering in the jungle, the
hopelessness of the venture, could only
be equalled by Robert Stephenson’s
meeting with a shabby castaway, a
mining-engineer who had lost favor
with Simon Bolivar in Peru—Trevi-
thick, inventor of the steam-engine!
That astonishing meeting happened
at the Cartagena inn where Stephenson,
at the end of his contract, was awaiting
a ship to New York. He bought Trevi-
thick his passage to England, and him-
self, after losing almost all his baggage
and money in a shipwreck, went to
America, was feted in New York, and
so returned to Liverpool and to partner-
ship with his father, busy building the
Liverpool-Manchester Railway, in
1827. By 1829 Robert Stephenson had
designed and built the Rocket.
Thus there were some 24 years
between the invention of the steam-
locomotive and the development of the
Rocket, the locomotive which so many
mistake for the world’s first. But
the Rocket was important because it
settled once and for all the argument
whether fixed haulage-engines were
preferable to locomotives: until that
time responsible engineers didn’t
believe that a locomotive could be relied
on to go uphill. Because of the pro-
tests of locomotive-engineers, especially
of the Stephensons, a day was set for
a trial of engines of certain weights that
would fulfil certain conditions ; and it
was in this trial that the Rocket, with
its new tubular boiler and its single
driving-wheel connected directly to its
side-stroke pistons (much of it was
developed from a Stephenson invention,
the Lancashire Witch), satisfied the
judges, and won the competition. Rolt’s
chapter on this test, with its descrip-
tion of the Rocket’s rivals, one “all
covered with copper like a new Tea
Urn,” and the discomfiture of their
drivers, is more exciting than a box-
ing-broadcast.
So the book goes on to the opening
of the Liverpool and Manchester rail-
way, when the Duke of Wellington was
delayed and Huskisson was run over,
and George Stephenson averaged “the
incredible speed” of 36 miles an hour
driving the Northumbrian to Eccles
with the dying politician; and so on to
the Stephensons’ greatest job, the
London and Birmingham railway, and
Robert Stephenson’s friendship with
Brunei, the co-operation of these tw o on
their amazing bridges, and the steam-
yacht he liked to holiday on.
It is not as varied a book as the
Brunei biography, but quite as enthral-
ling, as full of manipulations, rivalries,
and anxieties; another record of
achievement to justify the quotation
from a poem by Chesterton which pre-
cedes it and asks when people will
think to honor the inventors of the
industrial revolution, the “poet-race”
which “shot such cyclopean arches at
the stars.”

Reviewed Briefly
Darkness Visible: Norman Lewis
(Cape). A competent and impressive
novel by a writer who, one feels, has
seen everything and remains calm—
though Lavers, his geologist employed
by an oil company, is deeply moved by
the horrors of the Algerian war which
extends into the area erf the oilfield.
The implications of the book go a
good deal deeper than the suspense
and excitement that hurry the narrative
along. Norman Lewis weighs in the
balance the benefits of civilisation
imposed upon a people sorely in need
of help, yet with sustaining traditions
of their own.
* • * •
The Burning Ain Eugene Mira belli
(Hutchinson). A young American’s
novel telling of a few climactic days in
a young love-affair, rather skimpily
stretched over the frame of a novel.
The events take place during a long,
hot weekend in an American town,
and the heat, the garden shade and the
indolence and energy of an afternoon
on the beach are presented with a
sensuousness that is the outstanding
characteristic of the writing. It is
pleasant to find a novel of this kind in
which the lovers are not entirely
divorced from other people in their
preoccupation with themselves. The
Molla family is quite convincing—the
old Italian grandmother, and the
parents, and the young brother who
tags along with the lovers.
