THE MAN WITH THE GUN
Nothing to say, just take the rifle
Out the back-door, through the garden —
Heavy with the daphne which she planted
On evenings such as this —out the gate
And away from the day’s work
With his gun on his arm ;
Plenty to think about now, work and
weather,
What tomorrow —fix the fence by the old
stack,
Put the bull to the last lot of heifers
Or go on grubbing gorse—knowing all the
time
That no tomorrow will be so easily put
away
When a man is in the middle of it
Making some sort of a past to plague him
Out of his sofa, out of his paddocks,
Along the river with a gun on his arm.
Nothing to say, but plenty to remember
now —
A bit of sniping along the river Arno,
Rifles, and every man who raised a head
Held kicking in some gunsight—not the
cold
Gamble with the big guns bursting earth,
Trees or sometimes men —and now? This.
Nothing to say, but even before he went
She knew what he would do to the evening
Not because he always took a gun, but
because
When he did he would wear his black
beret
And the khaki tunic with the badges
And the ribbons which she resented, but
Could never tell him, not wanting to say
She hated him like a stranger in that
uniform
Spoiling her evening when she would have
gardened
At peace with the dying day and the
blackbirds
And the sound of cattle, but for a man
out
With his gun like the touch of a whip
On the flank of each dull day.

Shanghai at Peace and War
Mabel Wain Smith, whose Spring-
time in Shanghai (Harrap) bears an
almost embarrassing dedication to “The
Bulletin,” has achieved a neat English
book, with her own drawings, very
different from some of her typescripts.
That from which the account of the
lovely slinky “Dusk” was printed, for
instance, was on the back of some kind
of ship-specification forms, cut to
different sizes. This was. one suspects,
Mrs. Smith's method of sub-editing por-
tions of which she did not approve;
and often one “page” consisted of as
many as three foolscap sheets sewn —
not pasted, but sewn with needle and
cotton —end-to-end, so that they had to
be unfolded to the depth of about a
yard, like a postcard of views from
Katoomba . . .
The early chapters of the book pro-
ceed with the tranquillity of the
“Dusk” study of the lady who
alleviated the boredom of life
without her seagoing husband by walk-
ing without clothes into the bedrooms
of her boarders. There is life in the
house in Shanghai where the servants
saw to everything; favorite cats; visits
from the beautiful daughter of a well-
to-do Chinese family—the small-talk
and curious detail of pre-war life in the
East, which gains its charm from the
obvious happiness of this young
American wife with her English
marine-surveyor husband.
Then, as though Fate, supervising
Mrs. Smith’s literary progress, had
decided that this allegretto-scherzando
movement has gone on just long
enough, the Japanese arrive and the
work proceeds lento doloroso: the
Smiths are sent up the river (down the
Grand Canal, in fact) to Pootung, “the
most dreaded of internment prisons.”
They settled-down in Room 13 in a
corner under a bats’-nest with 74 other
internees “married and single, including
39 adolescent boys, plus bedbugs, bats
and rats.” up 69 outside stairs of an
old tobacco - warehouse, without
lavatory or water. There was the battle
when Tanya came back from the
improvised w.c. to find her husband
allegedly looking over a curtain at his
best friend’s wife, Zita —to which he
replied that he was merely looking to
see that his friend was using a
mosquito-net, as required of all who
had had malaria; there was the women’s
sewing-school that repaired 20 pairs of
socks, eight coats, three overalls, 15
pairs of shorts and one pair of pyjamas
in one morning.
There was the Australian who began
an art-class; the doctor who drew a
wisdom-tooth with forceps made from
a spoon-handle, after which a physio-
therapist got the patient’s jaw back to
normal position. There was the mis-
sionary who at this early hour con-
tradicted stories that had been going
around about the beautiful lives led
by the Chinese Communist Army
isolated in the north. There was the
Slavic woman who decided to risk all
to get revenge on a Japanese guard,
waited with a heavy broomhandle near
the women’s lavatory (into which the
guard liked to follow internees), and
caught the emerging Mrs. Smith a
painful blow on the leg . . .
Finally freed, the Smilhs returned to
their Shanghai flat, passing on the
stairs kimonos, split-toed socks and
heavy spectacles, and found the
polished floors burned by charcoal
fires, chair-covers slashed, a mattress
nailed over the living-room door and
the curtains in shreds. Mrs. Smith
made the trip to Mongolia which gave
her her previous book, “Land of Swift,
running Horses,” and visited Philadel-
phia. Mr. Smith did thirty months as
marine superintendent for the Yanks.
Then they both went for a holiday to
London, returning to Shanghai not
very long before the advance of the
Chinese Communists pushed them out
for the last time.
This section contains some of Mrs,
Smith’s best writing, notably the story
of the pirates who held-up her steamer
on the way to Formosa; but best of all
is the story of how she went walkine
with Wash Amah to visit Wash Amah's
aunt on the farm. Part of the way
they went by junk; the junk-family
rejoicing because they had salvaged !
coil of heavy cable-wire; very valuable,
Just as the junk was pushing-off. a
peasant girl pulled herself out of a
ditch, crawled on deck and collapsed,
gasping “Soldiers!” She was mutilated,
The rest of the story Mrs. Smith
heard later from Wash Amah—how the
girl had died and the junk-family,
afraid of being found with the dead
body, wound it round and round with
the copper wire and sank it—thus
giving-up a bit of luck equivalent to
first-prize in the Sydney lottery.
Korean Novel
In The Tall Man (Cassell), which as
“No Flowering Road” won third prize
in the “Sydney Morning Herald’s”
1957 novel competition. A. M. Harris
has done for an Australian intelligence-
officer’s patrol in Korea what T. A. G.
Hungerford did for an Australian
commando-patrol in New Guinea, in
“The Ridge and the River.”
Both are extraordinarily well-written
books, both by men expert in the Army
and their chosen terrain, and the present
reviewer is not here to say one is better
than the other: the main difference is
that Hungerford’s patrol was made-up
of young Australians, whereas the Tall
Man’s patrol (he never gets a name,
and one merely presumes his rank) is
made-up of Koreans and a Chinaman.
Harris’s book is set in Korea after
the first onset, with the Chinese Com-
munist forces threatening Seoul. The
purpose of the patrol which is the mam
action and climax of the book is to
cross a river, get through the mines and
the Chinese forces, and buy with a con-
signment of drugs information gathered
by an old Korean charcoal-burner. The
suspense of the journey and the return,
one of the patrol shot inland and
carried until he dies on an improvised
stretcher, another shot by front-line
Chinese just as the end is in sight, and

passage across the river and dying 111

MEDIATION IN INDONESIA
THE view of Dr. Evatt that Aus-
tralia should intervene to conciliate
between the Indonesian rebels and the
central Government in the existing
state of war conflicts even with the
desires of the Djakarta Government
itself. Time for conciliation, also,
seems to be running-out.
Dr. Evatt, of course, usually takes
an attitude different from that of the
Australian Government on any subject
at all, but on matters of foreign affairs
he really puts his heart into it, even
though he seems to have set different
standards of behavior for those
countries outside the Iron Curtain
and those in it.
The Communists under Ho Chi-
Minh, specially trained in Moscow and
later purposefully armed by the
Chinese, in his view are not to blame
for the attacks on Indo-China. Mr.
Churchill and Mr. Roosevelt are res-
ponsible.
The Communists, who, without a
declaration of war, seeped a million
trodps into North Korea within a year
of taking-over China, are fine fellows
and should be recognised diplo-
matically.
Australia must (he thinks) keep its
nose out of those countries where, by
force and guile, the Communists take-
over, as they always take-over. Yet
there has never been a case in history
where Communism has achieved
control by an initial vote which was
not backed by the jackboots and
bayonets of a Red Army.
Australia, following Dr. Evatt’s line,
must recognise the rights of any country
to go Communist if it wants to, as part
of the world-revolution, or even if it
does not want to, as in the case of the
satellites of < Eastern Europe.
But in Indonesia, where the Govern-
ment is largely Communist-dominated
and Communist-armed, which flouts
international law, which is blustering
and predatory, determined to take away
from the Dutch an area which has no
racial or geographical affinities with
its own dominions, we must come
in as mediators. It is an exception to
the Evatt rule, and one might well ask
why.
What is there to mediate about
which could concern us or which we
could remedy? And what remedy is
there open which a Government
with a preponderant military force
and the backing of the Kremlin is likely
to accept?
Only surrender.
Australia could only step in and tell
the rebels that they have no chance
and that they should obey the Govern-
ment and knuckle-under. "
Moreover, Dr. Evatt appears to
believe that there is only one lot of
rebels.. He fails to acknowledge that
outside Java and the adjacent islands,
which have the bulk of the population
and batten on the resources of the rest
of the Indies, great areas of “Indonesia”
are to some degree in a state of
insurrection.
There has never been any Djakarta
control worth the name in the Celebes
outside Macassar. Ambon has been
steadily resistant. Most Sumatrans
loathe everything their President
stands for, and even more what
a variety of his followers stand
for—if they stand for anything except
religious or international opportunism.
Some of them certainly don’t stand
for the things they profess to stand
for, being mainly interested at the
moment in promoting any idea which
will produce chaos and allow them to
build their real objective out of it.
The Southern Moluccas profess to be
independent. Is Australia to mediate
with all of these? And with the dissi-
dent interior Dyaks of Borneo?
The recognition of Communist
China, which Dr. Evatt also advocates,
is a very different matter. That
country would be better recognised.
It will be a happy day when the West
is free of the falsities inherent in the
recognition of the phantom China of
Chiang Kai-shek which the Americans
continue to profess to treat as the de
facto Chinese Government.
That such an entity, which could not
last a week without getting almost its
full civil and military sustenance from
the Americans, should be rated a great
Power with the privilege of the veto in
the United Nations is almost a farce.
It might not be if it represented a
great ideal of freedom instead of a
warlord tyranny on the approved old-
fashioned Chinese model, rapacious
and with scarcely a thought for the
well-being of the people of China.
But as things are it is a brake on
the idealism of the West, a liability
save as the provider of a force of man-
power whose usefulness is offset by its
moral position.
It is true that recognition of China
poses problems. It is difficult to
recognise a country which shows,
through its maps, that it professes to
control the eastern seas to within gun-
fire of the Philippines coast and which
observes none of the international
laws. But the position of the world
outside it is at least strengthened if it
accepts recognition on normal civilised
terms and agrees to observe inter-
national law. Then, if it fails to carry-
out its undertakings, it is a lawbreaker;
now it is merely an acknowledged out-
law, which is a law to itself.
Recognition, already granted by the
United Kingdom on a tentative basis—
with charges d’affaires in both Peking
and London—would be healthy, but
not on Dr. Evatt’s terms. These involve
not only recognition pure and simple,
but the drawing of the teeth of Seato.
As in some other things, Dr. Evatt’s
approach is in line with that of the
Communists, who sincerely want recog-
nition of China by both the Common-
wealth and Malaya so as to allow free
passage of Communist agents and
organisers within the areas and
particularly the influx of Trojan-horse
immigrants into the Malayan area.
No recognition will work without
a strong Seato to back the rights of
the weak countries to keep out sub-
version and make their own destiny.
Dr. Evatt, however, wants Seato so
weak that it cannot police its area, at
the same time admitting China to
equality with the civilised nations.
His attitude on Indonesia is incon-
sistent with that on China. Isn’t there
rebellion in China as well as in
Indonesia? There is, and more impor-
tant to world peace and security than
the dysentery of resistance to the
actual Government which operates in
Indonesia.
What is sauce for the goose is sauce
for the gander. Surely Dr. Evatt should
advocate that Australia step in and
arbitrate between Chiang Kai-shek and
Mao. And shouldn’t we also mediate
between the Hungarian rebels and
Khrushchev?
But perhaps there it is too late.
Khrushchev has done his own mediat-
ing with such effect that Dr. Evatt s
friends in that quarter have no rebels
left to contend with. And their fate
does not seem to disturb him any more
than it worries those who mowed them
down.
Not one bitter word does he ever
say against Communism in me
ascendant.


THROUGH THE MISTS OF 43 YEARS


PLAIN ENGLISH
Food for Mugs
The eighteenth national congress of the
Communist Party of Australia was
nothing if not frank. .
Its objective, set-out in its official
journal, was “oneness with the people
and an unbreakable unity behind a
scientific Marxist-Leninist leadership.”
And it appears that there were soft-
shells and soft-heads galoie—“doctors,
lawyers, writers, painters” —who were
involved in affirming these principles,
which aim for the destruction of pro-
perty-ownership, the nationalisation of
the professions and of capital, the rule
of the dictatorship of the proletariat —
“ruthless and irresistible” —leading to
world-revolution and “peace,” gained if
necessary by force of the kind that was
used by Russian tank-corps to secure
tranquillity in Hungary.
Hungary provides an excellent example
of the technique of obtaining “peace
according to the doctrines of Lenin and
Stalin,” for which every Communist is
supposed to yearn (or at least yell) from
the cradle to the grave.
Most of the congress, of course, did
nothing but put up its hands in favour
of the policies which Comrade Sharkey
brought back from Russia. >
The “decision of the Supreme Soviet
of the U.S.S.R. to suspend nuclear tests
without waiting for an agreement with
the capitalists” was necessarily received
with -applause. But a day or two after
the Australian celebration of this
mysterious triumph it became known
that a curious sudden closure of the
southern regions of European Russia to
foreign visitors, and the hurried bundling-
out of tourists, might be due to the
explosion of the dirtiest H-bomb in
history, which took place either immedi-
ately before or immediately after Com-
rade Khrushchev made his magnanimous
decision. This explosion has been
showering adjacent countries with
radiation.
It is, of course, possible that the
explosion was “dirty” on purpose and
organised in order to threaten and
frighten those countries which run along
the Russian borders. If that were the
objective, damage to the health of
Russians in the process would not worry
the Kremlin.
At the same time it was followed by
such a spate of soft-soap promises by
Khrushchev to the Russian people about
the fairyland full of consumer-goods
which, is coming to Russia to make the
comfort of the U.S.A. look like some-
thing out of the Middle Ages, that it
would be easy to deduce that Stalin’s
successor had been forced to offer a sop
to his subjects to cover something which
had disturbed them.
The congress’s official view of Seato,
of course, ran in line with that of Dr.
Evatt, who thinks it is a body dedicated
to the use of “force” in moulding the
policies of Eastern countries which want
I© go Communist. Comrade Sharkey
considers that it is “an imperialist
military organisation dedicated to the
maintenance of colonialism in South-east
Asia and to aggression against People’s
China, North Korea and North Vietnam.”
The party, of course, is all for Presi-
dent Soekarno and accuses the
imperialists of “planning the attempted
assassination” of that former Japanese
collaborator, and of promoting through
bribery and corruption the counter-
revolutionary attempt of a handful of
military officers to overthrow “the
elected Indonesian Government” —which
wasn’t elected at all, save by Soekarno.
All Australia’s prosperity, it seems —
the high price of wool, of base metals,
and export foodstuffs —was due to
materials “being stockpiled for war.”
Mr. Sharkey wants this to stop—-he
gloats that the era of stockpiling has
ended and that now “prices are falling
rapidly and unemployed armies grow-
ing.” This, he seems to think, is a delight-
ful approach to the milleniiim in which
Communism will triumph and lead to
Socialist victory starving millions who
have lost their all.
What the “Socialist victory” is going
to sustain itself with was not explained.
Or, if it was, the explanation was lost
in the cheers of the “doctors and
lawyers” and others at the thought of a
crash “such as that of 1930, which would
create very serious problems for the
capitalist class.”
Nobody explained how in that crash
the doctors and lawyers were going to
escape its effects.
Communism certainly is food for mugs.
Ccst-of-living and Drought
[From Canberra]
While Ministers are looking ruefully at
the latest C-series cost-of-living figures,
which show an upward trend of 3s. over
six capitals, they are heartened by the
fact that the rises occurred only in
drought-affected States.
But, apart from the fact that Mel-
bourne, Adelaide and Perth did not show
any change from the previous quarter’s
figures, they still regard seriously the
boost which the drought gave to costs in
N.S.W., Queensland, and Tasmania.
The very fact that next-door neighbors
on Federal and State awards respectively
are living on differing basic wages could
be embarrassing to Governments.
The Federal basic wage is pegged at
£l3 3s. a week, while the basic wage for
workers in N.S.W. under State awards
is now £l3 14s. a week.
Estimated cost of the shock rise to
N.S.W., which has automatic adjustments
for State-award workers, is £1,500,000 —
a staggering amount when compared to
the recent reductions in the wage, which
allewed State instrumentalities to
“breathe easily.”
The cost to transport services alone
will seriously affect the Cahill Govern-
ment’s Budget in N.S.W. for the ensuing
year, in the course of which it hopes to
hold a successful election.
The steep increase in the wages-bill,
which will hamper the State Govern-
ment’s attempts to improve housing and
sewerage, will provide the N.S.W.
Opposition with a case.
HIFAR
The Australian Atomic Energy Com-
mission’s Research Establishment, of
which the High Flux Atomic Reactor
(HIFAR) is the focal-point, is at Lucas
Heights, 20 miles south of Sydney. This
reactor was opened last Friday by Prime
Minister Menzies, in the presence of
about 1000 guests, prominent among
whom was Sir Thomas Playford, the
Premier of S.A.
The chief scientist of the research
establishment (Professor Watson-Munro)
explained in simple terms what was likely
to happen when the button was pressed
to set the reactor working. When the
Prime Minister had finished his witty
opening-speech he pressed the button
and, to everyone’s unspoken relief and
Professor Watson-Munro’s evident de-
light, everything happened exactly as
predicted.
After the cereptony had ended it was
possible to walk into the reactor and
listen to an explanation of each section
of this complicated mass of machinery
given by the scientists in charge of each
particular operation, and then to tour
the research-laboratories.
It augurs well for Australian science
that the young men who explained these
complex processes with such clarity and
enthusiasm all seemed to follow the
example of the chief scientist. Though
technically skilled beyond the capacity of
the ordinary man, they had not lost
contact with everyday life, and this was
evident from the way in which they
answered questions asked them. '
Victoria Grogs-on
[From “C.S.”I
The Queen City of the South may now
wear another crown. According to Dr.
John Birrell, the police-surgeon, Mel-
bourne is the Queen of Accident Cities
against all the world, with 22 road-deaths
per 100,000 population. At the Alfred
Hospital 56 per cent, of drivers admitted
for treatment have been drinking, and
so have 76 per cent, of all accident-
victims.
There can be no doubt the figures
exaggerate the significance of rush-drink-
ing on the accident-rate, because the
Alfred serves a far vaster area of Mel-
bourne than the other public hospitals,
and an area with a higher proportion
of drivers ; but, making full allowances,
they are still alarming.
They are a withering commentary in
themselves on the retention of 6 p.m.-
closing in Victoria, won by a brilliant
campaign frightening uninformed and
untravelled citizens into voting against
later closing-hours by presenting a mis-
leading picture of the awful events which
would follow if 10 p.m. was adopted.
The awful events are in fact following
the retention of 6 p.m.; after the pubs
close, the incidence of road-accidents
soars.
Dr. Birrell then put himself among


the uninformed and untravelled majority
bv advocating, “to get away from the
after-work ‘rush' chinking,” the closing
of bars between 4 p.m. and 7 p.m. and
then reopening them until 10 p.m.
An after-work drink has become one
of the accepted habits and rewards of
civilised man, with a more leisured drink
in more civilised cities than Melbourne,
and the closing of bars at 4 p.m. would'
deprive many of it and, to face it, result
in a mid-alternoon swill by at least a
proportion of the others.
Dr. Birrell, despite his campaign
against the drunken driver in Victoria,
is no wowser,, but in this proposal he is
supporting the' narrow men who secretly
do not want anybody to have any drink
at all at any time.
These people, with obsessions or pro-
fessional interests against drink, do not
wish to learn, but Dr. Birrell is young
enough to discover, in time, that the
best method of eliminating “rush”
drinking is to end the cause of the rush,
the closing-hour, and to have bars open
over the whole period from 5 p.m.
onward.
Facts and Rainbows
Little can be> said about the British
Budget save that it is pedestrian.
ft is almost forgotten that when it
was planned it caused a schism in the
Cabinet on the eve of Mr. Macmillan’s
departure overseas, and the resignation
of the Chancellor of the Exchequer. Its
main features, involving big cuts
in the defence Budget and the reduction
of the forces on a four-year plan to a
level which makes many authorities
uneasy, goes side-by-side with a timid
grant of aid to the housewife in the shape
of sales-tax reductions on cosmetics and
household appliances, homebuilding,
stamp-duty, and some other minute bits
and pieces of reduction.
The essence of the Treasury’s outlook
seems to be that until the economy is on
a more even keel and measures of last
September have fully given results, mark-
ing-time is the best policy. Also, it may
feel that until the spate of demands Lor
increased wages and shorter hours has
been arbitrated and untiL the picture of
the slump in the United States has
become clearer there* should be no
spectacular changes of plan—if any
spectacular changes are contemplated.
Perhaps they are, and will be pulled
out of the hat before the next general
election. But in the meantime Labor is
capitalising the dullness of the Budget
and using the advantages possessed by all
Oppositions of being able to promise to
the limit before an election.
A censure-motion was foreshadowed
as soon as the opportunity offered.
Labor’s Mr. Wilson spoke about spread-
lng unemployment and Britain “facing
stagnation.’'’ He declared that with the
"easiest world-price conditions for 20
years” the Government should be able
to reduce the cost-of-living and said that
h it did not do so it would be “guilty
°f grotesque mismanagement ”
£22-million Each Way
Myer’s, the Melbourne retailing giant,
is having £24-million each way on the
retailing dilemma —whether the future
will be more rewarding in suburban
shops or in the city. The company will
build on the corner of Elizabeth and
Lonsdale Streets, adjacent to its current
farthest-north point from Bourke Street,
and it will spend the other millions on a
28-acres regional shopping-centre at
Dandenong Road, East Malvern, one of
the superior outer-suburban areas.
This suburban project is interesting.
It will include Myer’s first suburban shop
competing with chain-shops (presumably,
chiefly, Coles and Woolworths) and 30
or so small independent shops (any one of
which might give a Myer department-
head a headache occasionally), a super-
market, nursery and ample parking-space.
It has been made quite clear by
shoppers in suburban Melbourne that
they have little interest in markets or
shopping-areas of any kind where there is
no real competition, and the successful
old-hands at Myer’s apparently intend to
invite the stillest competition to the party.
According to A. H. Tolley, Myer’s
chairman, the business, already the largest
of its kind in our hemisphere,, is bursting
at the seams.
Telegrams Less Popular
[From Canberra]
The great flop in telegraph services
throughout Australia in recent years is
directly attributable to the steep imposts
levied by the Government in the Budget
of 1956.
It is not a new trend. Telegraph
business has been declining ever since
the Government attempted to raise post-
office revenue through these channels.
While officials advising the P.M.G.
try to fob-off the decline in traffic to
competition of frequent airmail services
and a speedier trunk-line system, the fact
remains that 23,960,000 telegrams were
handled in 1956-57, compared with
25,410,000 in 1955-56.
People are finding it increasingly diffi-
cult to express themselves adequately in
telegram-form as against the new high-
speed methods of the trunk-line system,
which connects caller to caller almost
immediately.
It is significant that in the year under
current review record telephone-traffic
was handled —1,234-million local calls,
an increase of 47-million on 1955-56, and
106,-million trunk-line calls, or nearly
seven-million greater than the previous
year.
The heartening feature of the P.M.G.’s
report to Parliament was the profit of
£3,117,046 shown in the commercial
accounts, compared with a loss of
£425,278 in 1955-56. The telephone
branch showed a surplus of £5,280,794,
but the postal branch recorded a loss
of £1,526,168.
Incidentally, the post-office provided
£4,380,000 for superannuation (£2,630,000
more than was actually paid-out to
former employees) and £878,366 for
interest on loan funds.
A Shop Out of Town
Many interested parties are belatedly
advancing reasons why the new Monash
University in Victoria should be built in
a rural area ; and, although most of them
admit it would be costly, or more costly,
to build a residential university in the
country, they claim the cost should be
amortised over a century or, preferably,
several centuries.
One of the chief protagonists of higher
education in the country is Professor
J. P. Baxter, vice-chancellor of the N.S.W.
University of Technology, who has been
telling interested Victorians that the
results at Orange (N.S.W.), where his
university set-up an experimental uni-
versity college of engineering, have been
amazing.
The college had been established
because so many country parents were
reluctant to send their sons away to the
capital to continue their education after
matriculation, and at Orange students
were able to complete the first year of the
engineering course by studying part-time
for two years; and last year the first
students to complete the college course
had achieved results among the State’s
best.
Fred Boylan, chief accountant of
Consolidated Zinc, who has had con-
siderable experience of university-life in
the U.K. and U.S.A., as well as in Mel-
bourne, has recommended to the State
Cabinet that Monash should .establish
and own a satellite-town in a country
area where there was a good rainfall, with
agricultural production or potential and
on or near a river ; Gippsland could pro-
vide such a site, and the Latrobe Valley
would offer an area of great future
technical development.
Although Boylan is associated with the
great metal-companies which have their
headquarters, in Collins Street, Melr
bourne, and although it is an open secret
that the State Cabinet expects industry to
finance some faculties in the new uni-
versity, his interest in the site is purely as
a citizen ; and most citizens will agree
that the reasons advanced against siting
Monash in the country are precisely the
reasons which are always advanced
against siting anything at all important
outside a capital.
Woomera Rocket-range
Woomera rocket - range and the
weapons-research establishment at Salis-
bury, S.A.,on which more than £73 million
has been spent, will probably absorb
between £lO million and £l2 million from
the forthcoming Budget, according to
Supply Minister Athol Townley, who has
made an inspection-visit. It was stated
during his trip that in the fortnight after
he became Supply and Defence Produc-
tion Minister he had arranged regroup-
ings in Melbourne and Sydney which
would save £50,000. This is the sort of
thing taxpayers like to hear!

the biscuit was in perfect shape and as

were. Not persevering was a sign of
weakness ; only the men fell down on
that job and refused to suffer it out;
though I do remember an uncle who went

Back in the old Edwardian days
Before foundations ousted stays,
When dials with “sideboards” were

Papa was bashaw of the house,
Lording it over brats and spouse —*

Stem discipline he exercised;
He lectured, ordered and chastised.
Had someone offered the suggestion
That with his wife he should confer
On matters of domestic stir,
His sanity’d have been in question.
Women, emancipated, watched
That glorious “ Master” era scotched ;
Soon equal say they were demanding.
Had they but been content with such,
Husbands might not have cared so much;
But ever since they’ve been expanding!
What paterfamilias, ! ask,
Would now dare wear the tyrant’s mask,
And set domestic whip a-cracking?
For it’s the likelier shot that he
(Using the same sound simile)
Would find he’d get the verbal

Post-prandial pow-pows are the drill
For those who wed for good or ill
And in their double-harness canter.

While banished is the cut-and-thrust,
And even junks of gentle banter.
In such a placid atmosphere
The erstwhile lord may bend his ear.

To have these talks. His wife can tell

WAR I ROMANCE
[From F. M. CUTBACK,
somewhere on Salisbury Plain, March, 1958]
THEY’RE evergreen. Ran across him
the other day over a little trouble
about damage-insurance on a car, he
being an assessor, and found he was
aforetime a Digger of the 15th Battalion,
A.1.F., and lively enough to hold his
own with any of his younger competitors
hereabouts.
His story was romantic. Met the girl
first, daughter of wealthy Belgian people,
in Charleroi about Armistice-time, and
they arranged to marry. “Mind you, her
parents weren’t too keen, • Australia
being a long way away and my prospects
unknown —to me or anybody else —but
they didn’t oppose us, and I went off
back to Aussie to get a job and then
send for her.
“Well, back home things were a bit
chancy for a while and I didn’t seem to
make good at anything much. I wrote
to her a few times, but after a couple of
years I thought it was a fair thing to her
not to keep her dangling ... so I jilted
her, you might say.
“I never married —just couldn't get
going on anything. But she seemed to
to have me in her mind, wrote now and
again, was going to marry a bloke but
didn’t. About 1924 her father —as I
heard long afterwards—wrote to me say-
ing if I liked to go back and marry her
he would fit me into his business ; but I'd
moved my address and never got the
letter.
“You'd think that would have finished
the story. Not on your life! A few
more years ; then her old man died ; she
wrote and told me, and I
wrote back friendly - like
and wished her all the best.
Finish, I thought.
“A year or so passed,
and she wrote again;
she’d got married. That
would be in the ’thirties. I
was in Frankston then,
outside Melbourne. I
replied, wishing her all
happiness. Finish, I said to
myself!
“Not a bit of it! The
second war came on and
obliterated everything for
the time being, but not us.
After the war had been
over a bit she wrote
saying her husband had
been killed, and she and
her mother were back
home and she often
thought of me, and did I
ever think of her, and the
funny thing was she sent
that letter addressed to me
just ‘Frankston, Tas-
mania,’ and on the
envelope added ‘or to his
sister,’ and my sister received it and
sent it on to me.
“I was back in Brisbane then with a
small business plugging along ; it was in
1950, and I thought: Well, by cripes, if
she still thinks as much of me as all that,
what about letting Fate have a go?
“I could sell-out and go and see her.
So I wrote and said I would do that if
she thought at this late hour we
could make a do of it, and if so she could
tell me where to meet her.
“She answered she’d meet me in Lon-
don if I’d tell the date of my arrival. So I
sold-out in Brisbane, took ship, and there
1 was in London again, riding in a taxi
to the hotel she named ; and up I go to
the hotel-desk and ask for her. Yes, go
to room so-and-so. Outside the door of
that room I stopped and couldn’t help
thinking: What am I going to see on
the other side of that door, after —what
was it —30 years? An old tired woman I
can't recognise, or anything like the girl
I left in Charleroi? Then I knocked and
the door opened and there she was —
radiant!
“Well, we married; I got down to
working-up a business at this game while
we lived a while on our capital, and here
we are as happy as two kids, with a com-
fortable home in the west of England, all
our furniture paid for, owing nobody
anything . . . Come over and see us —
come over just to see her. She’s
worth it!”
AN A.I.F. COINCIDENCE
By HORACE FLOWER
T»ACK in May, 1918, the Second Divi-
" sion, A.1.F., was busy holding and
consolidating the line after checking the
Hun advance from Hangard Wood to
Albert, in the region of the Somme. The
ridge at Morlancourt was a vital pivot
in the fighting, and the lines-of-com-
munication were still somewhat nebulous
and very sensitive. Qne special emer-
Rolly Goddard, a Digger who settled in France
after World War I, is now owner of the
Central and Anzac Hotel, Amiens
C See article next page .)
gency roadway was mapped by the
Divisional Engineers across two branches
of the Ancre, with bridges designed to
carry our 18-pounder field-guns should
a German attack necessitate a fail-back.
Because aerial photography would
reveal the course of such a road if used
for traffic, and the location of the bridges
(which were built of timber and designed
to merge into the overhanging vegeta-
tion), guards were placed at both bridges,
About the end of May, or early June,
our battalion had come out of the front-
line at Morlancourt and we were given
duty in these bridge-guards and other
restful assignments. Fish in the stream
and in the lakelets of the surrounding
marshy lands were a pleasant change of
diet, so Mills grenades were used freely.
One glorious, clear, sunny, still day I
was on sentry at the rearmost bridge when
a tired and perspiring figure appeared, en
route to the 6th Brigade h.-q. and other
objectives. The uniform was not quite in
line with ours, but I discovered that the
wearer was a war-correspondent of the
A.1.F., by name F. M. Cutlack. My duty
was to send him back and downstream to
the nearby shell-wrecked village where he
would make his way to his objective and
take the risk of periodic shellfire raking
the roadway.
However, I guided him to a side-track
which led to our nearby dugout, where
a brew of tea and some of our rough
tucker could help him along. He lit his
pipe afterwards and spent half-an-hour
yarning, and then we bade him “So long,
Digger,” and watched him off.
Several years later I bought my copy
of a book which now lies beside my
typewriter: The A ustralians : Their Final
Campaign, 1918, by F. M. Cutlack.
I had often wondered what became
of this chap Cutlack. But it took The
Bulletin of March 12, 1958, to tell me.
There in “Personal Items” on page 15
the name of Fred Cutlack stood-out,
cheek-by-jowl with my own name on
page 14. His address is there, in Hamp-
shire (England), so I am writing to say
“Hello!” to him.
INITIATION
Our column rumbled through the noon-
day glare,
Each driver’s eyes half-closed against
the light.
Under the canopies, men half-asleep
Squatted among their gear, packed in like
sheep.
There was no hint of danger in the air,
No foe in sight.
We had no inkling Death was close at
hand,
That we had caught the hunting eaglet
eye
'So swift and low the snarling fighters
came,
Before the riddled trucks erupted flame ,
Before the red blood spilled upon the
sand,
They had gone by.
As we awakened, shaken and grim-eyel
They vanished over the horizon’s shore.
Behind them, from the deadly seed they
sowed,
Smoke-columns grew above the desert
road.
And we, in those shocked seconds wlwe
. men died,
Knew this was war.

Diggers Who Stayed Behind
By JOHN LAFFIN (in Armentieres)
ON the wall of every
classroom in the public
school of Villers-Breton-
neux, France, is a
placard with the words
N’oltblions Jamais L’Australie
—Never Forget Australia. This
motto, still so conspicuous 40
years after the last Digger left
the Somme, is a fair indication
of the regard in which the
French people hold Aus-
tralians —and, in particular, the
Australian soldier.
The people of Villers-Breton-
neux, where the A.I.F. stopped
the German advance in April
and May, 1918, and so saved
the city of Amiens, have a
special reason to be grateful
to Australia. After the war
Australian money rebuilt the
devastated town, and the
schoolchildren of Victoria
donated the money which
raised the new school. A
lengthy inscription on the
school’s foundation-stone bears
witness to this.
When I visited the school a
few days ago a class of seven-
year-olds chanted me a song
about the “jumping kangaroo.”
I suspect that it was composed
by a Frenchman, because the
kangaroo described in the song
was a queer animal indeed, but
again it was a moving indica-
tion of the town’s awareness
of Australia. One of the main
streets is Rue de Melbourne
and one of the leading shops
is A la Ville de Melbourne.
A few miles out of town
stands the Australian Memorial
—an imposing monument over-
looking the fields and shallow
valleys and woods around
Villers, Corbie and Hamel.
The walls of the memorial are
inscribed with the names of
11,000 Diggers with no known
graves, while the monument
dself faces a cemetery in which
He 772 Australian soldiers.
The monument - caretaker,
Charlie Atkins, is a former
Light Horseman who finished-
U P in France with 2nd Division
Artillery. Atkins, from Henley
Beach, South Australia,
returned to France in 1920 and
forked with the War Graves
Commission before taking-
over the monument, where he
now plays host to an average
, a hout two Australians a day
nr °ughout the year.
Atkins is one of three Old
Diggers still living in the
battlefields areas. Most
prominent of the three is Roily
Goddard, owner of the Anzac
Hotel, Amiens. At 68, Goddard,
formerly of the 16th Battalion
(Western Australia), is one of
the best-known men in Amiens,
and seldom is his pub without
an Australian guest.
Harry Waldon and his wife, Marie, an original
mademoiselle from Armentieres, outside their
home in Armentieres.
Wounded at Villers-Breton-
neux in April, 1918, Goddard
returned to France at the end
of 1919 —without ever going
home —and opened a mercery-
drapery business in Villers-
Bretonneux. In 1938 he started
in the hotel business, but lost
everything during the Occupa-
tion. He escorted 16 British
women out of France with the
Germans on his heels and
served as a liaison-officer with
the British Army.
Still very much an Aus-
tralian and a Digger, Goddard
finds himself regarded as an
unofficial Consul, and both
gendarmes and Town Hall
officials call for him whenever
an English-speaking visitor is
in difficulties. No Old Digger
wanting to visit the battlefields
asks for his help in vain.
Two years ago a Digger
from Western Australia, tour-
ing the battlefields with his
wife, was taken seriously ill
at Valenciennes, about 150
miles from Amiens. The
worried woman phoned
Goddard, who abandoned his
business and went to her aid,
only to find the Digger dead.
It was Goddard who handled
all the unhappy details and
saw the widow safely back in
England. He doesn’t talk
about these incidents himself,
but his many friends know all
about them.
Another time a Digger from
the 9th Field Ambulance
wanted to return a flag he had
souvenired from the fire-station
of a village in the Somme. He
came to France and Goddard
took him to 4he village, where
there was a spectacular parade.
The mayor (who was fire-chief)
received the flag, which had
first been owned by his grand-
father.' “We couldn’t have
been more warmly welcomed
if we’d turned-up with the
French national debt in cash,”
Goddard recalls. “Nobody was
critical of the Digger for taking
the flag, but I guess everybody
was astonished that he'd
brought it back.”
I would have thought that
after 40 years Amiens might
have forgotten that Australians
saved the city; but, in fact,
even the children are taught
about it, and the whole
populace is constantly reminded
of it when they visit the mag-
nificent old cathedral. On a
huge pillar is a plaque, and on
it, in French and English, is
the Jegend: “To the glory of
God and to the soldiers of the
Australian Imperial Force who
valiantly participated in the
victorious defence of Amiens
from March to August, 1918,
and gave their lives in the
cause of justice, liberty and
humanity this tablet is conse-
crated by the Government of
the Commonwealth.”
The third Old Digger repre-
senting Australia and the
A.LF. is Harry Waldon,
formerly a head-gardener with
the War Graves Commission
and now retired. Waldon not
only lives in Armentieres but
is married to a mademoiselle
from Armentieres. Now 60
and mother of a daughter aged
37, Marie Waldon still has all
the charm that captivated the
Digger.
A member of the 11th
Battalion (Western Australia),
Waldon is so unchanged by 40
years in France that he might
have arrived yesterday. Until
his recent retirement his
greatest satisfaction in life was
to help an Australian find the
grave of a son, husband or
father. I have been staying
with him in Armentieres, and
never was a man more generous
or open-hearted a typical
Digger.
Armentieres is a big place
today—it has a population of
about 10,000 —but ask anybody
in the street for “I’Aussie” and
they’ll direct you to Harry
Waldon’s modest home. He
was gassed in the first war, a
prisoner of the Nazis for five
years in the: second, but he has
no bitterness against the
Germans, who, he says, were
worthy opponents on the field.
The old song, “Mademoiselle
From Armentieres,” is still
(Continued on page 32)


POLITICAL POINTS
The extent to which the gambling-
craze has saturated the life of N.S.W.
is evident from the move by the Christian
Brothers Order to raise funds for addi-
tions to the training-college at Strath-
field (N.S.W.). The Hotel Pacific, at
Manly, valued at £190,000, is to be
put-up as first-prize in an art-union in
which 370,000 £1 tickets are to be offered.
Six other prizes will be home-units
valued at £5OOO each.
Announcement of the art-union has
followed the Cahill Government’s sus-
pension of the Opera House lotteries.
Not unexpectedly the Catholic Church’s
art-union has brought a flood of
criticism from Protestant clergymen and
others, the most temperate of which has
come from Bishop E. J. Hilliard, Coad-
jutor Bishop of Sydney, who said: “I am
much happier in expressing opposition
to gambling in general than in tying-up
my criticism with the activities of another
church. Though I respect the convictions
of my Roman Catholic friends, I think
they are mistaken.” ■
Dr. L. tumble, a Catholic spokesman,
said: “It is easy to say that gambling is
evil, but it can’t be proved .... Pror
testants are in the majority in this
country, and if they agreed gambling
was wrong there would be no racing,
lotteries or betting of any kind.” Later,
Chief Secretary Kelly, whose department
controls lottery activities and the like,
said that the charge by Dr. Malcolm
Mackay, of Scots Church, that there was
“too close a liaison between the Catholic
Church and the Cahill Government,”
was “too stupid for words.”
The whole matter, however, represents
another political donnybrook that
Premier Cahill has left behind him on
his trip to the United States.. Lotteries,
jackpot-totes and the rest of it seem cer-
tain to figure prominently in the next
State election-campaign.

N.S.W. land-tax is showing-up as a
heavy burden in the accounts of Sydney
property-owners this year. 'Not only
were valuations increased last year, but
under the terms of the legislation all
property of one landowner is aggregated
for assessment purposes (on a sliding-
scale, . rising with the valuation); but
under Jhe Fair Rents law the landlord is
allowed to recover land-tax only at the
scale-rate applicable to the valuation of
each particular property.

Queensland’s Literature Board of
Review has revoked its ban on “Week-
end,” which began as a sex-and-horror
weekly printed in Sydney, and then
decided to “grow with its readers”; as of
last week it seemed to have grown-up to
the mental age of 15. Revocation of the
ban was based on the ground that the
magazine has been “reconstructed” since
the board’s order last November. “Week-
end” is reputed to have a circulation in the
vicinity of 500,000 a week. So much for
“literature,” banned or unbanned!

Labor Minister Holt has disclosed that
£45,625 has been handed-over by shipping
interests as “indemnity-payments” to Aus-
tralian maritime unions in order to get
permission to sail with non-union crews
either from overseas to Australia (new
ships being brought out) or from Aus-
tralia to overseas (in the case of old
ships being sold abroad). The Seamen’s
Union had received £35,210 of the stand-
over money, the rest being shared by the
Stewards’, Cooks’, Shipwrights’ and
Radio-officers’.
Fourteen ships were named by Holt:
Lady lsobel —£1400 from John Manners;
Rona —£5000 from John Manners; Caldare—
£ls7s per E. V. Elliott; Mernoo-Kini—£slsQ
from John Manners; Easby —£437s from John
Manners; Carcoola and Coolebah —£6250 from
John Manners; Elsanna and Caledon —£5000
from Banks Bros, and Street; Ulooloo —£4150
from John' Manners; Echunga —£4l2s from
Banks Bros, and Street; Tyalla— £437s from
John Manners; Noora-Kindur —£2000 from
Banks Bros, and Street; Comara-Damadora Del
Mar— £l62s from Banks Bros, and Street.
These do not include the Bonalbo,
although the “Seaman’s Journal”
claimed that the £1125 found inside
the shirt of Comrade Elliott V. Elliott,
secretary of the Seaman’s Union, when he
was arrested on February 7 on a charge
of drunkenness, was union money
received in connection with the Bonalbo.
It therefore looks as though Holt’s
figure of £45,625 is incomplete.

Harold Holt, Minister for Labor, told
the Representatives that the Communist
party in Australia had a membership of
not more than 5000 or 6000, yet its
-influence industrially and politically was
“very considerable.” The real danger of
Communist influence in Australia came
from the weakness of the Labor party’s
opposition to Communism in the trade-
unions. None of this, of course, is news;
but it is something that should be
brought-up in the House as often as pos-
sible. The fantasic cost of sea-freights on
the Australian coast is largely the result
of Communist control of the maritime
unions ; and transport, of 'course, is of
paramount economic importance to a
country like Australia where long hauls
are usual. The “opposition” to Com-
munism in the Labor party mentioned
by Holt is not only weak ; in some vital
parts of the A.L.P. it is almost invisible.

Eighty per cent, of Melbourne’s
electric trains run within two minutes of
scheduled times, but delays are caused
by big works to improve suburban
running, according to Warner, Minister
for Transport, and the rapid growth of
Melbourne’s population is loading the
suburban-railway network to saturation-
point. Warner must now be looking more
favorably at that wilful 100,000 who,
despite Railways’ pleas, will not “travel
by train and relax.”

Police-sergeant E. W. Bullock, support-
ing a motion to increase the N.S.W.
police-force by 1000, told his association
that bodgies were not as vicious as the
hoodlums of 20 years ago, and that more
cops on the beat could cope with them
easily. Bodgies and hoodlums were the
same type of people, and young people
who got into trouble should be treated
more severely. Crime-prevention by the
man-on-the-beat was preferable to
between 10 and 50 police on the spot
after the event, he said.
N.S.W. Police Commissioner Delaney
says that the problem of young people
frequenting milk-bars is overrated, and
that the bodgie and widgie cult would
die-out if ignored. The Teddy Boy cult
in England, he says, is harmless, but
thrives equally on publicity. Sofne of the
real problems in Australia, Delaney
declares, are due to young people with
too much spending-money.

M. F. (“Mick”) Bruxner will next
month retire from leadership of the
N.S.W. Country Party, which he has
held since 1932. Leadership of any
party for 26 years must be a record. He
was also leader of the Progressives from
1922 to 1927. He was made a lieutenant-
colonel after serving in Gallipoli, Pales-
tine and Syria. Minister for Local Gov-
ernment in 1927-30 in Bavin’s time, he
was Deputy Premier and Minister for
Local Government from 1932 to 1941
with Stevens and Mair. Bruxner
intends to stand for his electorate of
Tenterfield (which he has held since
1920) at the next poll. His successor as
party-leader is tipped as likely to be
Davis Hughes (Armidale), with S. D.
Dickson (Temora) and C. B. Cutler
(Orange) as possible contenders.

This week two Canberra departments

few recommendations being carried-out,
and it won’t involve any retrenchments,
though there is talk of “salary-adjust-
ments ip the higher range.” Employees

Immanent head of Supply since 1953, will
control the new set-up, but the head of
Defence Production, J. L. Knott, who is
expected to be posted temporarily to the
Public Service Board, may succeed him
when O’Connor retires later this year.
The new combined department will
employ about 5000 men and women.

“Mugga Way”: Is it because of the'

In the South African elections
Strijdom’s Nationalist party had a con-
vincing win, gaining nine seats to increase
its numbers from 94 to 103, The United
party won 53 seats (a gain of one), and
the Labor party, which held four seats in
the old Parliament, was wiped-out, as
were the four Independents.
The poll was the heaviest on record,
with 89.61 of electors voting. Chief issue
in the campaign was Strijdom's apartheid
policy of segregation for non-whites (who
outnumber Europeans by three to one),
which must now be considered as being
acceptable to the majority of white South
Africans, though not to the same degree
in all provinces. Another likely result of
the Nationalist victory is renewed pressure
for an early declaration of a republic.

“Ex-Act”: Now that the Minister for
the Interior has endorsed the famous
“Lakes scheme” (the crucial and decisive
aspect of the Burley Griffin plan for
Canberra which has never been
mented), perhaps something will be done
about it. The Minister made his state-
ment at a meeting in the capital at which
a former director of works for the A.C.T.
warned him that the scheme was “still
the centre of much controversy,” adding
that detailed consideration (whatever that
is) now beginning would have some
“interesting features.” The original
planner thought his lakes would reflect
a series of magnificent public buildings.
Perhaps the hesitation in creating the
sheets of water has come from nervous
politicians fearing that annoyed electors
might regard the lakes as places to tell
’em to jump in.


PERSONAL ITEMS
Almost every soldier nurtures a
secret belief that he possesses a rare
sense of humor, which enables him to put-
up with the various trials of service life,
but if must be rare for an individual
soldier’s sense of humor to be officially
mentioned. Major Albert Lewis Lazarus,
whose M.B.E. for service in Malaya
recently came through, seems to have that
distinction, judging by an extract from
the citation in the statement by the
Minister for the Army, which reads as
follows:
Major A. L. Lazarus was senior military
intelligence-officer in Selangor State, and
his contribution to the elimination of more /
than 70 Communist terrorists was outstand-
ing. On May 20, 1957, he guided a patrol
which resulted in the elimination of the
senior terrorists in the State. His enthusi-
asm, energy and sense of humor were an
inspiration to all who came in contact
with him. As a military intelligence-
officer he gave exceptional service.
Major Lazarus is now at Puckapunyal
(Vic.).

The “typical” Digger, no doubt, like
the “typical” Australian, is an unlikely
sort of person, since in both world wars
all manner of Australians served
together, with good or ill fortune, and
jointly made a tradition. Reg Weaver
(herewith), although he would stoutly
deny any claim to being a typical Digger,
seems typical, at any rate, of a fairly
representative section of both A.I.F.s,
and an important one ; moreover, it’s a
section which isn’t often represented in
print.
A city Australian with a background of
the bush, Reg isn’t particularly . sun-
burnt and his conversation hasn’t the
flavor of board-room or officers’-mess,
shearing-shed or cattle-camp ; it is, how-
ever, racily Australian. In at The
Bulletin the other day, and later, in at
the corner pub where the interview was
continued, he was much more interested
REG WEAVER
in talking about the South Sydney Junior
Rugby League club, of which he is a life-
member,-and such Rugby League figures
as Dally Messenger, Horder, Treweeke,
and “Chook” Fraser, than about himself.
Now 60, Reg was born at Wellington
(N.S.W.), went with his family from there
to Goulburn, then to Gundagai and on
to Sydney, where he attended St. Bene-
dict’s, Abercrombie Street the first
Sydney school, Reg says, to play Rugby
League —later worked in his father’s
coachbuilding business, joined the
A.1.F., was 17 at the time of The Land-
ing, was wounded on Gallipoli, served in
France with the 53rd Bn. and the 14th
M.G. Coy., put-in a couple of years with
the R.A.A.F. at Rose Bay during War
11, and has lived for a long time at Darl-
ington. A baker and pastrycook after
War I, he worked for the Railways for
20 years, and now drives a lift in the
city.
Short in quick-witted, with a
ruthless eye for pretension, military or
civilian, he unhesitatingly nominates as
one of his hobbies “Beer!” Another is
fishing—he used to go “outside”
regularly, now wets an occasional line at
Ettalong ; and, of course, Junior Rugby
League, which he claims has had a raw
deal with the Senior group. His Army
career, he says cheerfully and not quite
truthfully, can be summed-up as follows:
“Joined as a private. Finished as a
private. Deserves a K B.”

One of the most heart-warming

Ltd., for more than half-a-mrllion by

the business in the depression, partly with
his small savings and partly with his
earnings as a preliminary boy at Mel-

Alec Chisholm: Ethel Turner, that
charming woman and admirable story-
teller whose passing has been noted in
The Bulletin, lost her only daughter,
Jean, in 1930, and her husband, Judge
H. R. Curlewis, in 1942.
Jean Curlewis (Mrs. L. Charlton),
whom I remember as a bright and pretty
girl on the staff of Sydney “Daily Tele-
graph,” had collaborated with her
mother in writing The Sunshine Family
and had produced a number a worthy
juvenile books on her own part, and her
death at an early age came as a staggering
blow to the family. Sixteen years later,
when I was editing Who's Who in Aus-
tralia, Ethel Turner asked me to include
reference to Jean in her biography. She
was saddened, she said, to see in her
potential entry only “one son” and no
reference to her “one daughter,” who, it
was true, had died, but “not without
meeting with distinction.” Was it an
immutable law, she asked, not to
mention deceased persons in Who’s
Who ? That motherly appeal was un-
deniable, and so, in disregard of pr e ‘
cendent, the desired reference was
included.
The Turner-Curiewis combination, it
should be noted, have a remarkable
record in literature and the law. Ethel
Turner, her sister Lilian (Mrs. Lindsay
Thompson), and her daughter (Mrs.
Charlton) produced between them about
70 books of fiction and verse, and the


Curlewis side of the family has produced
four judges—H. R. Curlewis was a
notable judge in N S. Wales and his son
Adrian has succeeded him ; his cousin,
and the cousin’s son also became judges,
both in South Africa. H. R. Curlewis
(who was renowned for his insist-
ence on the use of “correct” English in
his court) wrote half-a-dozen books of a
legal nature, and his son Adrian also has
a taste for print as president of the Surf
Life Saving Association —he wrote the
article on surfing in the current edition
if The Australian Encyclopaedia.

John Robert Ellis joined the National

Victorian manager with more than 51
years’ service to the National and the
Army. The First War he spent at
Gallipoli and in France as a major, but
although he achieved a service ambition
in the Second War of getting command
of an artillery regiment, the Japanese
threat kept his show at home, in inten-

northerly points. Ellis, who is one of the
best-known men in assurance and one of
a number of distinguished Tasmanian-
Melbumians, was new-business manager
for the National in Victoria for 20 years
and became manager eight years ago.
He’s very interested in ex-servicemen,

sively. Later on he wants to get round
the world again, off the beaten track, if,
he wonders, there are any unbeaten
tracks any more.

ABORIGINALITIES
TjQW many dogs were at Anzac? One
that certainly got there was Paddy,
a pet of Colonel Beeston, of Newcastle
(N.S.W.). When the colonel ran into
red-tape —no dogs were allowed by
Army—he issued an ultimatum: “Take
me, take my dog.” The colonel won,
and Paddy embarked with his identity-
disk: “Paddy; 4 A.A.M.C.; Mormon.”
At Suez, Paddy accompanied his master
on an inspection of a submarine; he
fell overboard but was rescued. He was
in trouble again at Port Said, where he
vanished, holding-up the troopship while
a search was made. Paddy was
retrieved —at the abattoirs. Off Anzac
the sounds of bullets lashing the ship’s
side infuriated Paddy, and he barked
a protest.
When the Provost-Marshal ordered
that any dogs found on the Peninsula
were to be destroyed, General Birdwood
issued a reprieve for Paddy. But, swim-
ming with the Diggers off the beach,
Paddy “got it” from a Beachy Bill shell.
He died ashore, and was buried with full
military honors. —“Ailsey.”

“J.J.A.”: Talk about the poor wheat-
harvest! One cocky in our Victorian
district put the header into the crop and
went several rounds, and when he opened
the wheat-chute nothing came out.
Clambering onto the machine he opened
the box and looked inside. A chook was
there, pecking up the wheat as fast as
he harvested it.

“Sevenelms”: Having read that feijoas
are substantially grown in New Zealand
for the fruit-market, we inquired during
a recent visit at both Auckland and
Wellington shops. Probably our timing
was faulty, but the result was as fruitless
"Another case of radioactive fallout!"
as if we had been seeking mangosteens or
durians. Thus we still know not their
appearance or taste, but hopefully have
planted a couple of shrubs in the back-
yard. Will some grower of this Brazilian
native provide the low-down on the
exotic fruit?

“Jasby”: “Harbel’s” old hands who
contend (B. 9/4/’5B) that the furniture

could not have been sent out in the wind-
jammer Duncan Dunbar because, “the
house was built after the Dunbar was
wrecked” are confusing two ships. The
clipper-ship Dunbar was wrecked at The
Gap, near South Head, Sydney, on
August 20, 1857, with a loss of 121 lives,
there being only one survivor, James
Johnson. The Duncan Dunbar, named
after her owner, who had several vessels in
the Australian trade, was built in the
year the Dunbar was wrecked. She made
several voyages to Australia and was
wrecked on Las Rocas shoal off the coast
of Brazil on October 7, 1865, while out-
ward bound for Sydney. Her passengers
and crew were more fortunate than those
of the Dunbar —all were saved.

“Salmon Gums”: Ever had a good look
at a spider sitting in her web, or even at
the web itself? You’ll notice the “centre,”
the area from which all the lines radiate,
isn’t central at all. It’s well above centre,
as much as a couple of inches in a really
big web, and the spider sits there facing
downwards, ready to race to any part of
the web from which a struggling insect
telegraphs its position. If the prey is in
the lower section the spider is off to a
flying start, but it has to make an about-
turn before racing to the top of the web.
As the spider invariably faces earthwards,
the off-centre “centre” ensures that she
can reach any part of the web in
approximately the same time.

“Villefair”: Ever seen a swan volplane
down to water from a high perch, its
wings stretched out to the full, body

No? Nobody else has, either. Why in
thunder, then, must Yankee newsreel-
commentators and aquatic showmen
deliberately spurn our “swallow-dive,”
which does describe the feat perfectly,
and substitute the completely inept “swan-
dive”? And why in double thunder must
some of their Australian opposite-
numbers slavishly follow the cockeyed
lead?

, “Sol” : Watching a creek coming down
a banker carried my mind back to boy-
hood, when the teamster on our farm
took advantage of such an occasion. Old
Bill, once a Cobb and Co. driver, was
the last I saw wearing "Prince
Albert” toe-rags, never washed but
discarded when unserviceable, and he was
never known to use soap on his other
clobber. When the creek “came down,




“Would you mind explaining some of those knots to my boys, sir?"
his routine was to tie all his dirty duds
in a bundle on the end of a rope and
cast them into the flood, after having
anchored the other end to a tree. After
a couple of hours, mud, silt and other
debris was partially removed with a
quick swirl around, and the garments
draped over the nearest fence to dry.
In my youthful innocence I said, “But
Bill, they’re not washed.” Bill spat expertly
without removing the briar from his
mouth and replied: “No lad, but water-
sweetened.”

“Skipper S”: “Horseless Horseman’s”
par. on resting galahs (B. 12/ 2/ ’5B)
reminds me of an occurrence on a large
project in S.A. some years ago. The
longest span in 40kw. high-tension
line, over a rough gully, was 1000 ft.
Soon after the three conducting-cables
were strung, the largest and noisiest mob
of galahs I’ve ever seen came down the
gully and chose this span for their touch-
down. Every foot of cable was packed,
the resulting sag being so alarming as to
lead to hurried estimates the engineers
present. Allowing, conservatively, four
birds of 6oz. per foot, over two tons of
screechers tested the cables and pole-
guys. In other climes snow- and ice-load-
ing must be allowed for. But what text-
book deals with galah-loading?

“Bigend”: The largest pump of its
kind in Queensland, a Pleuger sub-
mersible, has been bought by McQueen

just outside Ipswich. An eight-stage unit
with eight centrifugal impellors housed
in a special tube-case, the pump will lift
up to 10,000 gallons an hour to a total

JSiosar: Any Abo-ite acquainted with
the process of kewmg, or cueing ?
As far as I Know the term is now rarely
used in Australia, but it was once applied
to the shoeing of bullocks m the
Kimberley country of W.A. “Kews,” I
gather, were made out of old slippers,
which were carefully nailed to the
bullocks’ feet. Most stations in the region
had their “kewing-pens.”
“Lignum”: The far nor’-west N.S.W.
mail-truck, heavily laden with goods,
had struck trouble on the rough road
with a badly leaking radiator. The
resourceful driver walked 10 miles to an
Afghan’s camp, borrowed a camel which
had a calf at foot, the condition being
that the latter go along too. Back, and the
transfer of mail-bags made, the mail
went forward again. The calf was very
skittish and careered around mother and
under her at a great rate, as though glad
of her promotion. The driver, fed-up
with these delaying tactics, tore-off a
mulga limb and made a swipe at the
fractious youngster, missed and smacked
the parent across the muzzle. It was
a bad blue, as, having deposited rider and
bags on the ground, Mum sped swiftly
into the blue, with baby trailing. The mail
still got through—on the mailman’s
shoulder.
MATING SEASON
Don’t go out in the dark in March
Under the rising moon.
Don’t go down where the wattles arch
The edge of the dry lagoon.
Don’t go down through the oleanders
Without a stick and a torch —
Keep to the lighted verandahs,
Read a hook on the porch.
For this is the month the black snakes
mate,
The month that the “tigers” roam,
Travelling early, travelling late —
Philandering far from home.
A man in the dark can’t see too clear
But a courting snake sees red,
So don’t go walks this time of the year .,,
Or so the bushmen said.

KATHLEEN DALZIEL.


THE captain of “S. S. Tyndareus”
(a Scot, incidentally, with an English- -
nian as chief-engineer!) was, whenever in
Hong Kong, the exclusive property of an
ancient Chinese bumboatman for all
harbor ferrying. Communication had
always been restricted to the passenger’s
instructions in the usual execrable pidgin.
Then-one night, as he was delivering his
fare alongside the gangway from the
Kowloon side, the old celestial Charon
broke the silence with: “Captain, may I
“Come into my den, old man."
ask why Holts always name their ships
after logical heroes?” —“Seven-

“Keskedee”: When enough water seeps
into his mask to restrict his vision, the
experienced skin-diver rolls over on his
back and looks upward to the surface.
The water which collects in the region
of his temples (the lowest points of the
mask in this position) is then expelled by
snorting vigorously through the nose. It
is that same principle which is applied to
the blowing of a bird’s-egg with the thin
tube in the hole, which, incidentally, is
always drilled in the side of the goog.
Only when the egg contains an embryo
in an advanced state of development and
no solvent is available should one resort
to “Dallyn’s” method (B. 26/3/’5B) of
placing it on an ants’-nest.

“Fairf”: Budgerigars never cease tc
surprise their breeders, with the variations
on color-sdhemes they can produce ; but
a budgie bred by a Fairfield (N.S.W.)
enthusiast has made avian history. Seen
hom one side it is no different from
a °y other “green” ; from the other it is
an ordinary “blue?’ The front view of
•ne bird is the one that sets connoisseurs
gaping If two different - colored
budgerigars had been split down from the
brown to the root of the tail and the
wrong halves joined together, the line of
green and blue could not have been made
to meet more precisely. An unfortunate
aspect, from a breeder’s point of view,
is that the bird can never be more than
an interesting freak—not even the most
expert line-breeder could hope to “fix”
the color and produce a strain of
similarly-plumaged birds.
* * * *
“Soomy”: Reading about “Alma”
and her sagacious pony (B. 12/4/’5B)
took me back to when I used a scruffy,
ill-tempered, ribby little ex-polo number
as transport in high-jhill country in
Northern India. Riding her on the out-
ward journey, even rowelled spurs
wouldn’t have jabbed her into anything
faster than a jog-trot, but homeward-
bound she would take the steep downhill
gradients as fast as I’d let her. So, that
dark winter evening, I was puzzled when
she stopped short, edged backwards, and
stood shaking her head and snorting;
then, clamping the bit between her ugly,
yellow teeth, beat it back up the track.
Nor would she stir from my host’s com-
pound when she got there. I forgave
her the next morning when I saw that
twenty yards of the track had slid down
300 ft. of sheer mountainside, leaving
inadequate foothold for even a tree-cat.
ALL AT SEA
TV/TANY people have seen round the
earth’s surface without being “round
the bend.” Unevenly heated air-layers
refract, or bend, light-rays, so lifting
distant objects into view. Horizontal
illusions occur, too, and lights can
deceive.
The Australian ship Nankin, 70 miles
from .Victoria’s south-west coast, should
have seen water only. Suddenly she was
surrounded by ships, houses and animals,
some upside-down. Officers knew the
simple scientific explanation, but the
Chinese crew had more faith in the Joss.
Once, approaching the Leeuwin, I
sighted land earlier than expected. After
a while W.A. suddenly sank with all
hands. A normal reappearance some
time later confirmed accurate navigation.
The ship Hertford, bound from
Adelaide to Sydney, saw her route
blocked by Mac Donnell Peninsula on
Kangaroo Island merging with Cape
Jervis on S.A.’s mainland. The peninsula
was visible in four equally separated
places, something like a drunk’s-eye
view, but all observers were sober.
Bearing for position in such a fantasy
could be wrong, but piling-up a ship in
consequence is probably a remote
chance. A navigator “in the gun” would
find his defence difficult; he can neither
assess abnormal refraction, nor, at times,
be sure it exists. An Admiralty Court
Judge might suspect evidence unless
another ship confirmed it.
In Spencer Gulf I sighted the Aus-
tralian National Line’s Ipyula. From a
mile she looked to be of a few-hundred
tons. When quite close she took-on her
normal appearance of about 10,000 tons.
From Fremantle in summer one often
sees superior mirage at Rottnest Island ;
an inverted image over the real island
appearing when the sea-surface is
abnormally cold.
The Dominion Monarch in Bass Strait
sighted through a telescope one side of an
inverted ship, 17 miles ahead, apparently
connected to the real ship by the greatly
elongated funnel. At 12 miles the
refracted half-hull showed the right way
up, with cross-trees visible on one side.
Radar distance and angle of elevation
indicated the preposterous mast-height
of 425 ft. Instruments, too, can be
fooled. Soon ail was normal except that
the funnel alternately “loomed” and
“stooped” in height. Five miles brought
normality.
Tricks of refraction are greatest near
the horizon and are always present, at
least slightly ; you see the sun rise before
it happens and you watch it setting after
it has sunk below the horizon.
If nothing better offers, a navigator
computes his. distance from a lighthouse
when its light first appears or finally
disappears, having regard to his height
and the light’s normal visibility. This
can grossly mislead. I’ve sighted Kan-
garoo Island’s Cape Willoughby light at
70 miles ; 50 beyond normal, and later
lost it although heading for it in clear
weather. It reappeared 20 miles beyond
normal expectation.
On the same clear night, nearby ship-
and shore-lights were barely visible pin-
points which occasionally became astoni-
shingly bright for brief periods.
In St. Vincent’s Gulf I saw what
seemed like a ship on fire. Through
binoculars it looked like a square-rigged
ship with two brilliantly luminous
golden sails. Experience enables an
observer to estimate very roughly a light’s
distance and I believed this to be about
four miles away, but radar showed
nothing within 22 miles. Half-an-hour
later the freak suddenly became a barely
visible pinpoint of light in the far
distance.

Business, Robbery, Etc.
The Wool-cheque
TNCOME from wool sold
-*■ during the nine months to
March 31 was (at £281.5
million) about £74 million
below the receipts for the
corresponding period of last
season.
Wool sold during the later
period amounted to 3,481,280
bales, compared with 3,579,027
bales in the earlier one.
Average price for greasy was
66.1 d. a pound, compared with
80.6 d.
In March this year the
average price was 58.5 d.,
compared with 84d. in the same
month of 1957.
The total cheque for 1956-57
was £483 million. It has been
estimated that the 1957-58 clip
will bring-in about £356
million —a drop of £127 million
The remarkable thing about
the lower wool-cheque this
season has been the way in
which the national economy has
stood-up to the fall in our
income from overseas. This has
been partly due to the fact that
previous h gh liquidity caused
by 1956-.57 rise in wool-prices
was drawn-off into the special
accounts of the central bank,
and is now being made avail-
able in limited amounts, and
partly by the continuing need
for capital-works in Australia,
which remains a stimulus in the
economy.
But most surprising has been
the strength of the investment-
market, which has had only two
notable reverses over the past
15 months, and the first of those
was soon more than offset by
another surge upward.
A.M.P. Bonuses
-REVERSIONARY bonuses
now being declared (for
1957) by the A.M.P. Society
on whole-life policies are up
2s. 6d. per cent, on the 1956
rates, and are the highest for
21 years. M. C. Buttfield,
general manager of the A.M.P.,
has explained that the increased
rates are the result of changing
investment conditions. “Bonus-
rates fell during and immedi-
ately after the war because of
the reduction in interest-rates
on Government loans, in which
the society invests large funds,”
said Mr. Buttfield. “From
1952 to 1957, however, the
bonus-rate has increased by
41 per cent.”
Holders of life-policies were
among the principal sufferers in
the cheap-money era that
followed the outbreak of World
War 11, and it is almost a
shock to find that A.M.P.
whole-life bonuses are now
back to the rate established in
1937.
With life-assurance premiums
and superannuation contribu-
tions up to £3OO a year now
allowed by the Federal taxa-
tion authorities as a conces-
sional deduction, and bonus-
rates getting back to pre-war
levels, life-assurance in Aus-
tralia is regaining its investment
attractions as well as its never-
diminished value as life-
assurance.
A high level of interest-
earnings seems to be assured for
1958 at least.

which will be put back into
the group in the form of 6
p.c. unsecured notes in the

ing-co. after seven years.
Of the holding-co.’s paid
capital of £1,043,718, there will
be a preference portion of
£293,718 carrying 6 p.c.
Profit for the year to Sep-

Natural Gas
l I nun L. Owen]
A CCORDING to a section of
the Sydney Sunday press,
a visiting expert states that
Sydney stands in the centre of a
great natural-gas basin and that,
eventually, this gas will be
piped, for industrial and
domestic use, to Lithgow,
Newcastle, Wollongong and to
Sydney and its suburbs.
The importance of this
reported statement lies in the
implication that the gas-
deposits occurring within the
Sydney Basin are of sufficient
magnitude and persistence to
justify a major project of
piping and reticulation.
There are, as yet, no grounds
for assuming that the known
gas-deposits underlying the
Sydney area have any com-
mercial significance. The
Camden No. 1 well encountered
a flow, estimated at 50,000
cu. ft. a day, from the depth
of 1355 ft., while Camden No.
3 gave only 30,000 cu. ft. a day
from 1100 ft.
Neither of these “shows”
attains anything approaching
profitable production, even if
they prove to be persistent, a
matter which will remain in
doubt until continuous tests
have been carried-out over a
period of several weeks.
Banks and the People
T AST week the Bank of New
South Wales transferred its
O’Connell-street branch io
glittering, spacious premises in
the- former Sydney “Herald”
building, corner Hunter and
Pitt Streets.
Outwardly there is not much
of moment in such an event,
but as a symbol of what is
going on in Australia it has
even when the
institution concerned with ,t
already' has a thousand
branches and agencies spread
all over the Commonwealth and
the,rest of the world.
The Bank of N.S.W. is the
oldest in the Commonwealth,
dating back 141 years—it
opened its doors on April 8,
-1817 —when it was established
in a rented cottage owned by
a lady who had been sent out
of England at the age of 13
on a seven-year sentence for the
awful crime of taking a pony
from its owner for an after-
noon frolic.
Its original assets amounted
to about £12,500 in capital, and
in making a new nest in the
largest newspaper-building in
Sydney it returns to an original
atmosphere of printers’ ink,
since its founding-president,
J. T. Campbell, was de facto
editor of the. official “Sydney
Gazette,” Australia’s first news-
paper, and its first cashier was
that well-known and benevolent
reformer Edward Smith Hail,
afterwards editor of the
“Monitor,” and a sharp thorn
in the sensitive side of
Governor Darling.
The ’Wales began life
virtually as a State bank under
the aegis of the Government
and on the initiative of the
Governor of the colony, but
this connection was severed
gradually, though even in
modern times, with the compeh-
tion of State institutions such
as the N.S.W. Rural Bank, it
has managed to keep-up its
relationship with N.S.W-
departmental finance on a large
scale.
In general finance it and its
fellow trading - banks have
weathered in an increasingly
healthy condition the on-
slaughts generated in

Coombs’s < establishment in
Martin Place, where even his
displays of cacti and aboriginal
art seem to do little to stem the
tide of progress in private
trade-banking as typified by
the growth of the branch which
has just been moved in Sydney,
and which, originally taken-
over as an unobtrusive branch
of the old A.B.C. Bank during
the depression, has grown in
the interval into something as
large as the whole corpus of
all the branches of any bank
in Australia, say, 80 years
ago—that is, within the life-time
of thousands of living Aus-
tralians.
Australia has reason to be
proud of its branch-banking
system, which has proved
flexible and adaptable to chang-
ing conditions. Even if
individual banks have at times
failed, the overall banking
system has proved itself capable,
whenever this has happened in
modern times, of giving shelter
to a weak sister and rehabilitat
ing her as part of a new family,
always with advantage to
depositors in the end. The
tendency of the last half-
century has been towards fewer
centralised and separate banks
and more and more decentra-
lised branches.
The banking system has not,
of course, survived because of
any love of it by Governments,
who almost universally regard
it apparently as something with
wings to be clipped and legs
that need to be chained.
Restrictions by the Common-
wealth Bank and Government-
backed competition from the
trading section of that bank
merely seem to strengthen the
faith of the public in the private
banking-system. And the events
of 1949 proved that a Govern-
ment which seems firmly seated
in the saddle for years to come
is apt to throw away its life
when it begins to monkey with
the banking system with a view
to carrying-out the operation
described by Mr. Arthur Cal-
well as “plucking the fowl” of
capitalism.
The trading-banks in 1949
proved themselves to be
stronger in public, approval than
the Chifley Government. They
are likely to continue in that
Position so long as they give
reasonable service throughout
the community and are backed
by prudent policies of security
combined with reasonably free
lending.
The entry of the trading-
banks into the savings-bank
held, generally till a year or
ago the preserve of the
Governments, and their alliance
in capital with hire-purchase at!
a more recent date, are natural
trends of the times. Each move
is born of a specific need, and
healthy extension of these
trends is desirable as a check
on the Government-enforced
credit-policies which &re as a
by-blow, making goldmines of
the time-payment business.
The banks, important as they
are now, will become more and
more important within the next
decade or two, in the light of
developmental expansion. The
immense sums of money which
need to be found for expanding
heavy industry, for expansions
such as the B.H.P. projects at
Whyalla and the Weipa bauxite
projects, with all the subsidiary
calls for the resiting and re-
housing of population, for new
population and for the feeding
of it and for new transport,
will mean new responsibilities
on an unprecedented scale for
the trading-bank system.
Much of the capital for
development will come from
abroad must come from
abroad. Whether it is attracted
here depends very much on
the overseas estimate of the
soundness of the banking
system and of the stability of
the banks.
Fortunately for Australia
their reputation for security
and management ranks as high
as any in the world. For that
Australia has very largely to
thank the fact that the system
was established by men
trained in the traditions
of Scotland, where branch-
banking is the rule, so that
instead of facing the problems
of American banking, where
the bank is often a local insti-
tution with limited resources,
there is a solid monolithic
foundation under the Aus-
tralian : deposit-bank structure
which it needs a major crisis
to even shake.

“The Great Sebastians”
The Firm has a nice double
in town at the moment with
“The Great Sebastians,” a
smooth, chuckling comedy at
Sydney Royal, and something
fresh and vigorous in the New
York City Ballet at the
Empire.
The Royal show is about a
couple of delightful characters
with a fake mind-reading act
who have just finished a season
in Prague in 1948. General
Otokar Zantek believes he has
a traitor somewhere among his
staff or associates and has the
Sebastians brought to a party
at his home for a demand-
performance in which he hopes
that they will uncover the
guilty one. They are about
half-way through their act
when news of Masaryk’s death
breaks-up the party, and since
the Sebastians had lunch
with Masaryk only a few hours
earlier they are asked to sign
a statement attesting that he
was in a most depressed state
and contemplating suicide
when they saw him. Naturally
they jack-up at that and it looks
like the treatment and forced
confessions when —well, it’s
worth the price of a pew to
find-out.
It’s also worth the price of
a pew for several other
reasons, not the least of them
being Roger Livesey and
Ursula Jeans in the principal
roles. As the Czech-born Rudi
Sebastian, Mr. Livesey has just
the right mixture of charm and
plausibility, of vanity and
volubility ; he is a smoothly
ingratiating actor who
can make you laugh with
him rather than at him, so that,
often enough, a bit of a
chuckle from him sets the
audience laughing at nothing
in particular. Which, of
course, is a very talented and
skilful business on his part.
Miss Jeans, too, has just the
right prescription for the
Cockney-born Essie Sebastian.
—a thin veneer of a very stagey
grand manner with Cockney
shrewdness and honesty break-
ing through it at the appro-
priate moments —all most
graciously assumed and
expertly played-off against Mr.
Livesey’s performance. Indeed,
the perfect matching between
them —in their rehearsals of
routine in their dressing-room,
in their convincing of General
Zantek, and in ' their frantic
hunt for information t o
support their act in the
general’s home —is quite the
most delightful thing in the
show.
The support, mainly from
soundly played stock charac-
ters, is excellent, with Eric
Reiman well out in front as the
bemused General Zantek, and
Walter Brown doing a tidy
job as the political commissar
planted in the general’s staff.

New York City Ballet
If this interesting importa-
tion which opened at Sydney
Empire the other night is a fair
sample it would be a reason-
able conclusion that American
ballet has plenty of vigorous
dancing and fresh ideas to
compensate for the apparent
lack of classic edge in its
dancers —that, of course, being
a general impression based on
a first night of four ballets,
and one that is quite likely to
be contradicted before the
eight programmes of the
season are through.-
The vigor and freshness were
most apparent in “Fanfare”
and “Western Symphony.”
The former, with choreography
by Jerome Robbins to Ben-
jamin’s Britten’s “young
Per s o n’s Guide to the
Orchestra” (based on inci-
dental music by Purcell), has
a rather irritating spoken intro-
duction to each instrument
and dancer but, that much
accepted, it is a vigorous and
colorful bandwagon with some
cleverly comical choreography
allocated to the percussion sec-
tion. It brought the house
down, which was a good thing,
because the audience seemed
faintly disappointed by ,the
preceding “Serenade” (Tschai-
kovsky-Balanchine) in which
some pleasantly fluid
choreography was obscured by
a very ragged corps-de-ballet
and the softness of the principal
dancers; a sharper, more
brilliant finish to their danc-
ing—and something sharper
than the indeterminate blue of
their costumes —would have
helped immensely.
“W e s t e r n Symphony”
(Hershy Kay-Balanchine) is
like something out of a Sam
Goldwyn extravaganza, and
there’s nothing wronjg with
that. The colors—gemlike
reds, blues and greens against
black or predominantly dark
qostumes and background—
are boldly and beautifully
effective and the dancing once
again fresh and vigorous, and
still lacking that final sharp
outline —although there were
most promising hints of it from
Allegra Kent, Diana Adams
and Jacques d’ Amboise, whose
litheness and elevation recalled
the young John Gilpin of the
Ballet Rambert.
A pas de deux, “Sylvia,”
was the evening’s main
opportunity for a display of
virtuosity, and Andre Eglevsky
did it full justice. Heavy in
appearance but not in action,
he’s as graceful as a panther
and seems just as incapable of
making an unlovely movement.
His partner, Patricia Wilde,
danced quite prettily, but
here again was that lack of
sharpness, of the hard classical
finish that is more-or-less the
last word in ballet. Possibly
this company has never had
it; possibly they were tiped
and didn’t show it; or possibly
they have discarded it in search
of greater freedom —if they
have it's a sad error, because,
as Margot Fonteyn and others
have shown us, it restricts
nothing and improves every-
thing.
❖ ❖
Emlyn Williams
It has always seemed to me
that England lost its greatest
dramatist in Dickens—next to
Shakspeare, of course; its
greatest prose dramatist to
gain its greatest novelist.
He did not present his
characters, as he is so often
accused of doing, as carica-
tures ; but as a dramatist would,
in gesture and dialogue ; not
stopping much to analyse them
but bouncing them alive on the
stage. Anyone who thinks that
for that reason he is less pro-
found than the deep-thinkers,
the analysts, from Dostoievsky
to Conrad, is making a mistake:
he is not less profound, he is
simply moke visible, more
audible, more alive.
And that is why of all the
world’s novelists Dickens lends
himself best to stage impersona-
tions : in fact, so far as I know
he is the only novelist who is
consistently performed in this
way—though I see from his
programme that Emlyn
Williams is also going to do
Dylan Thomas.
Emlyn Williams is far too
modest in describing his per-
formances as “readings" •
except that it is difficult to
find any other word which
fully describes them. “Drama-
tisations” might be better.
He does read from the
novels ; or makes a pretence of
it, with the open book spread
out before him. Sometimes he
even glances at it; but
obviously he knows his whole
programme by heart and
essentially he acts it: acts the
narration, acts each character
as he or she crops up, and is
quite as happy as little Paul
Dombey or Bob Sawyer’s
immortal landlady as he is as
the showman in “Mr. Chops"
or as Dickens himself in narra-
tion.
He comes on made-up as
Dickens, in an evening-suit so
like a modern dinner-jacket
that you’d hardly know the
difference; but with a red
carnation in his buttonhole
which somehow looks Victorian
and with a most noble set of
unmistakably Victorian
whiskers. He reads, or pretends
to read, from a desk with a red
plush cover (and a bouquet of
roses on it) which is an exact
copy of the reading - desk
Dickens himself used and
then he gets going.
It would be foolish to try to
describe the indescribable:
how he does it. But I remember
Norman Lindsay in The
Bulletin saying that the
Veneering’s dinner-party from
Our Mutual Friend, for its
scope and sustained animation
—the whole party alive and
moving the whole time —was
one of Dickens’s supreme feats
of organisation and characteri-
sation : and this man takes all
that in his hand and presents
the lot of it, as vividly and
amusingly as it is written.
He does the same with Bob
Sawyer’s bachelor-party. This
is no comparatively easy feat
(for a skilled actor) such as the
old impersonators used to do:
taking one character and
making him live. Nothing less
than a whole group —six or
more hilariously drunken
medical-students, with the
landlady, the servant-girl and
Mr. Pickwick thrown in —will
serve to display Emlyn
Williams’s artistry.
It is an artistry that keeps
you alert and entertained the
whole way through. I had no
idea, for instance, that so

Anzac Day has come to hold such a place in
Australian life that its approach provides in itself
a milestone in memory.
It is fitting that this should be so; for of all
the national days we observe, the Twenty-fifth of
April stands out as the one on which sacrifice for
our country’s sake is honored, and on which we
revere the men and women who spent themselves
that Australia might live and flourish.
Of such is the spirit of a nation made. On
such has the legend of every great civilisation
been founded.
Forty-two years have passed since the original
observance of Anzac Day—in 1916, on the first
anniversary of the landing at Gallipoli.' The day
was our own from the time of its making.
They have been years marked by trial and
triumph; years in which the younger ones who
served in other campaigns have come to march with
the First War veterans; years that have brought
Australia on to enjoy a rich reaping of that
prosperity-in-freedom for which high heroism has
gone in purchase.
And the debt to those who have defended this
country will grow as Australia grows, so that each
succeeding Anzac Day should find us remembering
them with a deeper sense of grateful homage.
One thought that comes back to me again and
again on Anzac Day is that this is a day on which
we stand corporate as a people—without divisions
of creed, forgetting the differences of opinion that
show on our civil occasions, remembering only
that men of every Faith in .our community
have fought and suffered and died to keep
Australia free.
That, no less than the respect we owe to the
heroic dead, is in the living lesson our Australian
warriors have left us; and it is only by taking into
our daily lives their spirit of unity in tolerant mate-
ship that we do full honour to the tradition they
made for us in Anzac.
admirable a balance of humor
and pathos could be found in
that sentimental little character,
Paul Dombey. I had cora-
nletelv forgotten how brilliantly
dramatic is the opening to
A Tale of-Two Cities, the gay
reception and the sinister
tragedy in the streets. And I
thought I knew my Dickens
pretty well, but Emlyn Williams
completely surprised me by
unearthing two very acceptable
novelties from the Christmas
Stories.
It doesn’t seem to me a show
that any critic should try to
find petty faults in, if there are
any, just to prove he is a critic.
You could hear nothing but
pleasure and admiration from
the huge first-night crowd in
the intervals and at the end,
and that’s all that need be
said about it: except that it
is guaranteed to send anyone
who sees it back to his Dickens
and back to Emlyn Williams.

Sydney Orchestra
Both welkin and audience
took a power of punishment
in the first-half of the A.B.C.
subscription-concert at the
Town Hall on Saturday night,
with the orchestra under
Sir Bernard Heinze.
It began with a first perform-
ance in Australia of the First
Symphony by Joseph Tal, a
Pole now resident in Israel, and
who is an exponent of “elec-
tronic music,” whatever that
may mean. The composer says
he derived thematic material
for his symphony, from an
ancient Persian-Jewish lamen-
tation, and the series of
whangs, scrapings, toots and
burps which comprise the
piece were indeed lamentable.
Next was Bartok’s Second
Piano Concerto, which had
Gordon Watson as soloist.
There was no lack of disson-
ances, crashings of brass, and
percussiveness in the keyboard,
but there was little resemblance
between the work and listen-
able music. Only briefly did
it make sense—in the opening
pf the adagio. Watson played
it with plenty of thrust and
verve.
Those who stuck these out
were rewarded for their forti-
tude by a performance of
Brahms’s Symphony No. 4, in
which the conductor drew from
the orchestra a very, high per-
centage of the power and
majesty which is inherent in
|his last great Oration of the
German. The beautiful sing-
tpg quality of the massed
Violins, and the finely-drawn
episode for flute, clarinet and
horn in the opening allegro ;
the softly-breathed clarinet
against pizzicato strings in the
slow section ; the splendid work
of the woodwinds in the third
movement; and the strength
of the rhythms in the final
movement —these were high-
lights in a very fine reading.

“All My Sons”
‘‘AH My Sons,” by Arthur
Miller, presented by the
Marlowe Society at the Union
Theatre, University of Mel-
bourne, concerns Joe Keller, a
small-town manufacturer who,
in the good old war-days, made
cylinder-heads for the U.S. Air
Force ; his wife Kate, who has
a deep unconscious grudge
against her husband and is
solacing herself with the belief
that her son, Larrie, reported
missing, is still alive and will
tum-up some day ; Chris Keller,
another son, who wants to
marry Ann Deever, their house-
guest ; and Ann, who was
formerly the airman’s girl-
friend but who has grown tired
of waiting for him and wants
to marry Chris.
To the horrified Mrs. Keller
this seems tantamount to
bigamy, if not incest. Her
hallucination is far more con-
crete than the real world. This
situation has sufficient emotion
packed around it to satisfy
most playwrights, but there is
much more to follow. George
Deever, Ann’s brother, turns-up
with a letter the missing airman
wrote his girl-friend just before
he suicided. He had resolved
on suicide because he had
discovered that his father, had
sold cracked cylinder-heads to
the Air Force, knowing them
to be such, and saddled his
manager with the blame when
it was discovered, and the
manager is now languishing in
prison.
Even this appalling piece of
information does not shock
Mrs. Keller out of her belief
in her hallucination, but it
fundamentally changes the
relationship between Chris and
his father, whom he loved,
whereas he never loved his
mother. When his father
tries to justify his act on the
grounds that he had to make
money to support his family'
and give Chris a good educa-
tion, Chris flings himself upon
him and nearly throttles the
poor old wreck, who totters off
and shoots himself.
In “Death of a Salesman,”
Arthur Miller made you feel
a certain sympathy for the poor
old fool. He has a more diffi-
cult job making you feel the

with the excellent assistance of
Geoff Shillinglaw he succeeds
fairly well in the Union pre-

seems to have got together
a remarkable team of actors
who make up for any technical
deficiencies they may have by
a wonderful excess of feeling.

“Simon and Laura”
What happens when a
ganglia of TV apparatus sprouts
metallic feelers in the living-
room of an “ideal, happily
married couple”? How does
the couple react to the daily
invasion of ,their home, for a
year, by a producer, script-
writer, engineer, two camera-
men and a make-up assistant?
Perhaps those questions
should remain engulfed in
farce and left unanswered.
Simon and Laura are not as
the knob-twisters see them ;
they regard the assignment
merely as a bread-and-butter
spinner. The minute those TV
cameras swing away to probe
a far corner, where the
fatuously be-powdered man-
servant spawns Old-Worldism
at an Oxford-impregnated
schoolboy, the happy couple
are at it, hammer and tongs.
Inevitably, in the middle of
a simpering interlude under
the careful eye of the camera,
restraint snaps: a humdinger
of a row, Simon fiercely wrath-
ful, Laura shrilly defensive.
This happens on their 200th
programme ; immediately a
8.8. C. chief phones through
to congratulate them on a
realistic performance . . .
In the Imperial Playhouse’s
performance at Mosman Town
Hall (Sydney), Keith Goddard
made a strong Simon, and
Betty Parsons nearly matched
him as Laura. The man-
servant came over reasonably
well, and Elsie Dayne, as the
cook-housekeeper, said her
brogue-birred lines broguishly.
Roberta Griffin, as the script-
writer, lapsed uneasily in and
out of a Canadian accent, and
John Eldershaw’s portrayal of
a theatrical agent was sharp
and convincing. Bill
Doughty, as David Prentice,
the producer, had his chance
but hardly took it: too much
strutting, not enough naive
pomposity.
As for the gang of TV men,
they seemed as far as possible
to have captured the coolness
and efficiency of top white-
collarites.

“The Belle of New York”
The Metropolitan Operetta
Society of N.S.W. seems to
have reached a plateau of
achievement from which it
shrinks from attempting the
next peak. In “The Belle of
New York,” at Sydney Con-
servatorium, it showed its
capacity to stage an operetta
with a fair degree of compe-
tence, its principals, Rosalind
Keene, Wendy de Beyer,
Robert Tasman-Smith and
Edwin Pfeiffer, singing very
pleasantly, and its comedienne,
Betty Cheal, displaying a fine
power of projectable person-
ality.
But the theme of the musical
comedy, the contrast between
the frivolousness of the dash-
ing “fast set” of the nineties
and the sanctimoniousness of
the “do-gooders” of the period,
was nowhere emphasised. The
mood and atmosphere of the
piece was completely lost (if,
indeed, it was ever realised),
the fault lying to a great extent
in the hotch-potch of costumes
worn and the very unstylish
hair-styles of the girls.
The Society, having achieved
so much, should now put more
study into giving more
imaginative interpretations of
the pieces it attempts.
Artbursts
Sydney Art
Sydney’s current exhibitions
are so sharply differentiated
that you really need to be
divided into three persons to
appreciate them.
As one person you can stroll
around the Royal Art Society's
autumn display at Anthony
Horderns, never being startled,
never being shocked unless by
mediocrity, and often being
quietly pleased at some glimpse
of promise, some touch of tech-
nical finesse, some evidence of
a genuine love for Nature,
which is quite as much a part
of good art as is love for paint
and design.
As another person you can
observe, with such eyesight as
his shattering impact of color
leaves you, that Maximilian
Feuerring at David Jones,
always a purple painter, has
exploded more vividly than
ever into mauves and pinks and
crimsons and greens and
piercing yellows. It is an art
less of life than of paint.
And as a third person, with
some vague hope of restoring
yourself into a unity again,
you can observe that in his bush
landscapes at the Macquarie
Galleries Herbert Flugelman is
as emphatic about paint and
color—though not so rococo —
as Maximilian Feuerring, while,
at the same time, no quieter
painter of the Royal Art
Society has a stronger feeling
for Nature.
The Royal Art exhibition is,
as usual, too large ; with too
much of a “tail” ; but it has
sold well and the standard
seems slightly better than last
year’s. Marjorie Steel and
Louise Perry are two artists,
new to this commentator, who
have had a shot—-and pretty
successfully, too —at that most
difficult subject, a stormy sea ;
G. K. Townshend paints with
his usual competence; there
are admirable small landscapes
by Dora Toovey and Garrett
Kingsley; and it is always
pleasing to see Norman Lindsay
in town again—with two smail
pastoral fantasies, both sold.
Feuerring's colors are too
often merely violent: the total
result is meaningless or, as in a
few slum-scenes and slummy
studio-interiors, surprisingly
dingy. But when they are
organised into a harmony, as
in the essentially abstract “Paint
Factory,” they can be \yarm
and attractive or, as in his
fantastic “Wollongong” land-
scape, dazzling. What, paint
alone can say he makes it say
quite strikingly in these pic-
tures ; and in one small oil,
“Blossom Time,” he seems
even to have listened for a
moment to something the earth
was saying.
Flugelman’s paintings are
very like those by the Mel-
bourne painter, Clifton Pugh,
which were shown at the Mac-
quarie Galleries a few months
back. Whatever “expressionist”
influence may lie in the back-
ground, their immediate
ancestors are obviously Drys-
dale and Nolan and they
could fairly be described,
except that a strong personal
drive is also to be noted, as
a combination of Drysdale's
solidity with Nolan’s verve.
They have force without
extravagance and they promise
a most vital development in
Australian landscape.
Other Sydney exhibitions
this week include Harold
Thornton at the Bisietta
Galleries and Israeli painters
at the National Gallery.
Films
“And God Created
Woman"
French actress Brigitte
Bardot makes it painfully clear
that her histrionic know-how
is pretty well limited to the
wearing of a perpetual sullen
pout and the adoption of a
langorous, hip-swinging gait
which is apparently meant to
pass for intense sex-appeal.
The plot would confuse an
electronic-brain, and the film-
makers have been too busy
concentrating on which parts
of Miss Bardot’s chassis to
photograph for the best effects
to bother about such trifles as
development of character.

Anna Magnani hasn’t much
opportunity in this Italian-

emotional intensities. The
story—about a nun whose
maternal instincts are so
aroused by a small abandoned
boy that she brings all her
organisational skill to saving
the condemned convent where
he is being cared for —moves
very slowly, and the tedium is
relieved only by some occa-
sional human touches and by
the restraint and understanding
which Miss Magnani brings to
the central role.

Industrial Acceptance Holdings, Ltd.
THE major hire-purchase financiers
continue to prosper, and the share-
market, which has, at times, adopted a
cautious and even vaguely suspicious
attitude toward h.-p. scrip, is now pre-
pared to accept a much lower yield from
th;s class of investment than that avail-
able a year or two ago.
The f.-p. ss. ords. in Industrial Accept-
ance Holdings, Ltd., the largest h.-p.
financier in Australia, fetched as little as
9s. sd. in mid-1956, giving a return of
8.8 p.c., the same shares being taken by
buyers to yield 7.1 p.c. in April, 1957.
At last week’s price of 14s. sd. the scrip
would return 5.7 p.c. from a steady 16f
p.c. div.
Net tangible asset backing at Dec-
ember 31, including uncalled capital and
share-premiums, was Bs. 6d.
A holding-co., J.A.H., was formed in
1954, exchanging 20,000,000 ss. ords. for
the 8,000,000 ss. units in Industrial
Acceptance Corp., Ltd. (1.A.C.). In the
following year a further 4,000,000 ords.
were offered to shareholders, one for
five, at a 50 p.c. premium.
The last of the “big three” publicly-
owned h.-p. concerns to establish formal
ties with a trading - bank, I.A.H.
announced in September, 1957, that it'
would issue 4,000,000 ss. ords. to the
A.N.Z. Bank at a premium of 4s. a share,
giving the bank a 14 p.c. share-interest.
By the end of last term (December 31)
half of the £1,800,000 involved in this
transaction had come in, and on receipt
of the balance (due by September 30
next) paid capital will reach £8,000,000.
There are 1,000,000 £l6 p.c. prefs.
The group finances the hire-purchase
of motor-vehicles, machinery, farm-
equipment, furniture and domestic
appliances in all Australian States, the
fast-growing Ajax Insurance Co., Ltd.,
a wholly-owned subsidiary underwriting
insurance risks for the organisation and
its h.-p. clients as well as seeking fire and
accident business outside the h.-p. field.
Financing a larger proportion of the
slightly higher number of new motor-
vehicles registered last year, and, at the
same time, meeting a growing demand
for consumer-credit from prospective
purchasers of TV-receivers, finance cos.
increased their outstandings under h.-p,
agreements by £32 million (to £262
million) over the 12 months to December
31 last. (In the previous year, when the
rates of sales-tax applicable to many
“consumer-durables” were raised and
new business voluntarily restricted, the
growth in the national h.-p. debt was
just under £l9 million.)
Well in line with the overall trend, the
value of the contracts handled by I.A.C.
continued to increase last term, the total
amount owing to the group by h.-p. and
other debtors (after providing for possible
losses) jumping by £7.7 million to £47.7
million. Including £3.2 million (£2.8
millipn in 1956) of earned insurance-
premiums, gross profit advanced by
£1,157,417 to £9,160,408, a big improve-
ment in investment income (up £71,289)
bringing the contribution from this
source to £105,993.
With debentures and deposits over

The £7.7 million added to book-debts,
etc., was accompanied by an increase of
only £3.3 million in the amount borrowed


from debenture-holders and depositors
the issue of long-term (one year
and over) debentures accounting for
the bulk of this increase. In
accordance with the board’s policy of
buying rather than leasing premises,
£378,875 was invested in freeholds, and,
with an outlay of over £130,000 on plant
and equipment, the book-value of fixed
assets was more than doubled over the
year. (Freeholds are shown at cost,
office - equipment, etc., at cost less
depreciation.)
Up .£764,990, clients’ retentions and
deposits (included in the above table with
creditors and responsible for approxi-
mately half the amount shown against
that heading) increased with the value of
the business handled, the sum due to
sundry creditors rising by £241,095.
A continued drift in employment
figures could hinder progress in the
current term, but the factors at present
limiting credit - expansion in other
directions have as yet had little apparent
effect on the growth of the h.-p. debt,
either directly or through a lag in repay-
ments. During the first two months of
1958, £8.7 million was added to the
amount owed to finance cos. under h.-p.
agreements.

York Motors (Holding), Ltd.
MOTORS’ well-taken decision
A to enter the motor-finance lists in
N.S.W. so far hasn’t shown backers any
additional benefits, and may not for
some time ; but it appears to have brought
some stability to the co.’s earning-power.
At £10,696,000, sales in 1957 were at
much the same level as in the preceding
years, but the continued rapid upsurge
of the financier offshoot, Glasgow Invest-
ments Pty., as note, deposit and overdraft
borrowings and other funds became
effectively deployed, tacked £895,028 on
to outstandings and increased net earnings
by £22,794, or about 9.4 p.c.
Of the consolidated trading profit
(£263,333), claimed after providing
£154,831 (down £3033) for co.-tax and
£26,650 (up £333) for depreciation,
£181,332 went to shareholders, whose
20 p.c. div. dropped back to the 1949
scale; and £82,001 of retained earnings,
together with a capital-profit of £29,906,
which accrued from the disposal of a
freehold in Castlereagh Street, Sydney,
less sundry adjustments, brought tangible
book-reserves to £3,083,530. Visible
backing for each ss. stock-unit —there has
been no recourse to asset-revaluation
since incorporation in 1939 —is 225.
Since the peak year, 1950, when ord.
capital was earning a lush 146.4 p.c.,
earning-rates have slipped to 53 p.c.
(1953), 55.4, 48.6, 26.5 and 29 p.c. (1957)
over the past five years. The only
capital-issue since 1950 was a one-for-
three affair in 1952, strictly cash. The fall
in earning-power of shareholder’s funds
has been very pronounced, from 44.1 p.c.
in 1950 to 6.2 p.c. in 1956 and 6.6 p.c.
last year.
The sharemarket is not oblivious of
these trends, and prices the ss. ords. at
12s. 4d.. to return a yield of 8.4 p.c. on
a continued 20 p.c. div. basis.

Besides the hire-purchase subsidiary,
the parent holds an exclusive interest in
nine actively-trading offshoots, three of
which were formed in 1956 as whole-
saling divisions to circumvent the carry-
ing of tax-paid stock Since dispensing
with its only asset, the freehold already
referred-to, Castlereagh Traders Pty.,
presumably becomes a rion-operating co.
In N.S.W. York Motors Pty. holds the
State-wide franchise for Chrysler, Rolls-
Royce, Bentley and Simca cars and
Fargo trucks, while in the Sydney metro-
politan area, Lancaster Motors Pty. is
co-distributor of Nuffield products,
Morris, Wolseley, Riley vehicles and
Nuffield tractors, for which also Rose
Motors Pty. is distributor for the
Parramatta district.
The group is represented in Queens-
land by U.K. Motors Pty., purveyor of
Austin cars and tractors, and Dominion
Motors (Queensland) Pty., which handles,
besides the Willys range, Oliver tractors
and Aveling-Barford heavy-duty equip-
ment.
At the moment the reintroduction of
the Willys Jeep into the Australian
market is being stepped-up, and to this
end a local subsidiary has been formed,
Willys Motors (Aust.) Pty., in which the
U.S. corporation and the combined Aus-
tralian distributors have an equal holding.
When ultimately, as is intended, produc-
tion of an all-Australian Jeep gets under
way, the present franchise should take-on
some real value.
New premises were occupied by Rose
and Lancaster Motors last year and
further large-scale projects for show-
room, service and sales facilities in
Sydney and Brisbane are past the
drawing-board stage. Future building-
operations will be financed from the sales
of existing properties, such as the above-
mentioned Sydney property.
Balance-sheet trends show the shifting
in emphasis to h.-p. trading:

Outstandings under h.-p. contracts
jumped by £895,028 to £3,069,983, and
funds for this purpose came mainly from
a reduction in stocks, down £403,564 to
£2,164,915, overdraft borrowings of
£90,459 and a further £150,270 of
depositors’ and trade-creditors’ money,
The £600,000 of 64 p.c. registered
notes is repayable in September, 1960.
In recent months, new-car registra-
tions have been steady' at the lower
levels prevailing after March, 1956,
when sales-tax was increased from 16.6
p.c. to 30 p.c. bn private vehicles, and
commercial-vehicle sales are showing a
slight revival; but competition from
new contenders in the field has tended to
reduce the share of the market available
to York Motors’ moneyspinners.
In a bid to hold its place as runner-up
to G.M.H., British Motor Corporation
recently introduced the Morris Major
and Austin Lancer, and these new models
materially enhance York Motors’ pros-
pects for the current year. Hire-purchase
business transacted continues to bound
ahead, and for the first three months of
the current term was 41 p.c. higher than
in the corresponding period last year.
Buckley and Nunn, Ltd.
nrHE Melbourne retailer Buckley and
Nunn, Ltd., has given a particu-
larly good account of itself in recent
, years, and last term the benefits flowing
from a higher turnover once again out-
weighed the growth in costs, both sales
and earnings rising to record levels.
A steady rate of progress has been
maintained in the first half of the current
term, and an unchanged 5 p,c. interim
div. went out to shareholders last month.
Specialising in high- and medium-
quality wares, Buckley and Nunn
carries-on a business established in
1851, the co.’s department-store occupy-
ing a valuable freehold site in Mel-
bourne’s Bourke Street.
Reserves have provided £477,262 of
the £838,082 paid capital, the last share-
issue, a one-for-one bonus in 1954,
following the revaluation of the freehold
property. Despite this doubling of ord.
capital (now £688,082, the balance ot
share-capital is in 7 p.c. prefs.), ord. divs.
have averaged 14.1 p.c. over the past
three years, compared with an average of
11.4 p.c. for the 10 years to 1957.
Although trading conditions lm ve
become increasingly competitive, a rising
turnover has enabled Buckley’s to cover
higher operating costs and still show an

Last term’s £153,141 profit was
derived from the sale of a wider
range of merchandise than that
previously carried, turnover
(undisclosed) increasing in both
value and volume. According
to the board, higher costs,
“principally salaries anu
wages,” made-off with “most”
of the amount added to gross
earnings, limiting the improve-
ment in net profit to £7llO.

, T ,he formation of Associated
Leathers, Ltd., in 1948, amal-
gamated the interests of five
well-established, allied cos.
engaged in the leather indus-
tries of Australia and N.Z.
The group operates five tan-
neries and trades through
branches in every State of the
Commonwealth, throughout
N.Z. and in London and Hong
Kong.
The assets of Zwar Bros.
Pty., tanners, of Beechworth
(Vic.), were acquired towards
the end of last term by the
issue of 264,011 10s. ords. at
a premium of £92,404 (7s. per
share). (An existing offshoot,
previously known as R. W.
Thomson Pty., now trades as
Zwar Bros. Pty.) The deal
lifted the parent co.’s paid
capital to £1,626,950, of which
£196,250 carries a cumulative
5 p.c.
Since formation several new
subsidiaries have been formed
or acquired (mainly by the
issue of scrip) and'the organisa-

other lines, many of which are

make a sizeable contribution to
total turnover.
The last request to share-
holders for additional funds
was in 1952, a one-for-four par
‘issue during that year adding
£250,000 to ord. capital.
Attempting to offset shrink-
ing profit-margins by a higher
turnover, the group lifted its
sales by 3 p.c. over the year
to June 30 last, but, despite
this increase, certain (unnamed)
subsidiaries ran-up losses
totalling £32,215, while there
was a substantial decline in the
earnings of most other units.
After providing £59,459
(down £71,180) for taxation
and £54,995 (up £12,967) for
depreciation, the group, as a
whole, turned in a net profit
of £120,865, or £79,277 less

Raised from 9 p.c. to 12| p.c.
in 1955, following a big
jump in earnings, the ord.
div.-rate was dropped, to 10
p.c., in 1956 and again last
term, to 8 p.c., to give an
average distribution since for-
mation of a little over 9.1 p.c.
The full 8 p.c.' was paid on
scrip issued in connection with
the Zwar purchase, net earn-
ings falling £3404 short of the
amount required for pref. and
ord. divs.
In terms of the higher ord.
capital, the smaller profit was
equal to 7.7 p.c., after satis-
fying pref. shareholders, com-
pared with 22.8 p.c. in the
record 1955 term and 14.7 p.c.
in 1956. Thanks to the £92,404
of share-premiums collected
during the year, a net
£85,828 was added to reserves.

From Herbert Holman
THERE are signs that prices
in general may soon come
down. The trend has been
this way for months, cuts hav-
ing been announced for such
a variety of products as tyres,
some grades of coal, oil, food,
commercial vehicles, transistors,
electric lamps and radio-
batteries. This is primarily due
to cheaper raw-materials and
freight-costs, blit there are also
other reasons. Manufacturers
are now feeling the benefit of
their high investment over the
last four years or so.
Competition, too, is having
considerable effect, notably in
the retail trade. One progres-
sive firm, Marks and Spencer,
by eliminating all unnecessary
paper-work, has enabled a
wide range of prices to be cut,
and other multiple shops,
including chemists and tailors,
have either followed suit or
stated that present prices will
not be increased. The aim
would seem to be to counter
smaller profit - margins by
increasing the turnover.
The forthcoming cut in
British iron-and-steel prices is
the first since before the war.
Compared with recent increases
(6 p.c. in 1956 and a further
1\ p.c. in 1957) the reduction
is slight—averaging a little
more than 1 p.c.—but it is a
healthy sign coming from a
basic industry. Again, the
reduction is the direct conse-
quence of the lower cost of
imported pig-iron, and cheaper
freight-charges.
Entertaining Royalty
The story of the visit of the
Queen and Prince Phillip to the
Old Vic to open the £90.000
extension is worth telling
because the occasion, though
carefully planned, was so
different from many others of
its kind.
Determined that the evening
should go smoothly and enjov-
ably for all, the Old Vic
administrators cut formalities
to a minimum, even to dispens-
ing with speeches. The excerpts
from Shakspearian plays were
short, ranging from the Closet
scene to Pyramus and Thisbe,
and included one item that was
anything but “drawing-room”
—the unexpurgated extract,
with Robert Helpmann and
Keith Michel’s dog, from “The
, Two Gentlemen of Verona.”
The audience was invited
democratically and without
favor, in this order: - friends
and relatives of the 165 staff;
representatives of the builders;
others who had contributed to
the five-year-plan.
Alter the perfoimance, the
Queen and Prince Phillip were
ushered into the circle bar to
meet the governors. Mean-
time, the auditorium was
emptied, the scenery removed
from the stage, the curtain
lowered and a passage-way
laid.
Michael Bent h a 11 then
escorted the pair through the
theatre. Immediately the
Queen climbed the passage-way
the curtain was raised and the
100-odd people on the stage
advanced to her, clapping. She
was completely taken by
surprise.
The company was “pro-
duced,” but in informal
groups ; they were not lined-
up in rows. The Queen and the
Prince mingled among them
and stayed 20 minutes longer
than intended.
Off-day Play
There are times when the
dramatic critic comes near to
weeping. This is one of them,
How is he to express himself,
without unkindness, when a
distinguished man - of - the -
theatre whom he respects
writes a bad play?
To sit through “Beth”
(Apollo Theatre) is an
embarrassing experience, „on
many grounds. Its theme, the
Vagaries of a 16-year-old girl
with a mental age of eight, is
a singularly unhappy one as a
basis for comic situations ; the
characterisation (monstrous
diva, millionaire suitor, legless
cripple, “cod” psychiatrist and
Cockney man-about-the-house)
is prolific yet shallow; the
dialogue alternates between
wordy aphorism and conven-
tional slang (“What are you a-
doing of?”); the jokes are
weak; the production is as
quaint as “The Boy Friend,”
and for the same reason ; the
whole affair is too facile, with-
out e : fber depth or real under-
standing.
One thinks of many things
not . strictly relevant yet still
pertinent: the easy, natural
humor of “Touch It Light” ;
the overwritten yet simple,
true-to-life writing of “Flower-
n S Cherry” ; the meticulous
construction and refined crafts-
manship of “A Touch of the
Sun ”; whether or not actors
should write plays or be
allowed to produce them • how
vivid and inspired Emlyn
Williams was as
Dickens and Dylan ihomas;
that same artistry seemed
absent from his new play,
In fairness, it may be said
that there are no deliberate
lapses of taste, that Beth’si
plight is never made fun of
and that /there is a germ of
hope in the development of
the plot. The acting is respon-
sible, sensitive and accomp-
lished but very hard going for
the players.

sung in France, but has no
reference to the Diggers. The
A.l.F.’s war-time version went
like this:
They laughed and loved in the
old French town, parley
vouz,
And her heart shone out of
her eyes of brown, parley
vouz,
But time fled by and there came
a day
When he and his cobbers were
called away,
Inky-pinky parley vouz!
Quiet the old estaminet, parley
vouz,
No more the Diggers will come
that way, parley vouz,
May your heart grow light
through the passing years,
Oh, Mademoiselle from Armen-
tieres,
Inky-pinky parley vouz!
Of all the armies which
served in France and Flanders
none is so well represented by
memorials as is the A.I.F.
Apart from the main Australian
Memorial at Villers, each of
the five divisions has its own
monument. The Ist Division’s
is at Pozieres, the 2nd’s at
Mont St. Quentin, the 3rd’s at
Sailly-le-Sec (near Albert), the
4th’s at Bellenglise, near St.
Quentin, and the sth’s at
Polygon Wood, near Ypres,
Belgium. The Ist Australian
Tunnelling Company has a
memorial at Hill 60, near
Ypres.
Menin Gate, Ypres, carries
the inscribed names of 6000
Australians who have no
known graves. Here, every
night of the year, the Last Post
is sounded by Belgian buglers,
and no matter how cold the
night a crowd of Ypres citizens
always attends the ceremony.
There is yet another
memorial in Pozieres Ridge,
where three Australian divi-
sions lost 23,000 men in seven
weeks in July-September, 1916.
A motorist could easily miss
this memorial, which is a

simple bronze plaque set
almost flush with the ground.
It is on the site of the old
windmill at Pozieres, and the
site, now fenced, is owned by
Australia.
The Germans, during the
second war, in no way defaced
any Australian memorial,
though the main monument
was damaged by shellfire'
during the German advance in
1940. They did, however,
remove the brotize statue from
the base of the 2nd Division
Memorial at Mont St. Quentin.
The statue showed a Digger
bayoneting the German eagle,
and I’m not sure that I blame
the Germans for taking it
away. How would a Digger
react to a German statue of a
Stormtrooper bayoneting the
kangaroo? A plaque notes
that the statue was taken away,
but so far no attempt has been
made to replace it with some-
thing less offensive.
Other less conspicuous refer-
ences to the Diggers can be
found all over the Somme and
Flanders. For instance, the
central cross of Tyne Cot
cemetery, Passchendaele, is
raised on one of the original
German strongpoints. A plaque
notes that the ridge was
captured by the Australians in
October, 1917.
Tyne Cot, the largest British
military cemetery in the world,
with 11,871 graves, is the
resting-place of 1353 Diggers.
Seven-tenths of the graves
(8365 of them) are unnamed —
an indication of the ferocity of
the fighting around the Ypres
salient. At least two Aus-
tralian V.C.s are buried here
—Captain Clarence Smith,
V.C., aged 23, of the 34th
Battalion, whose home was at
Abermain, N.S.W., and Sgt.
Lewis McGee, V.C., of the
40th Battalion.
Australians are buried in
several hundred cemeteries and
churchyards in France and
Belgium, and I have visited the
102 main ones —main because
of the numbers of burials.
Some of the smaller cemeteries
—really extensions of local
village communal cemeteries —•
are very impressive. An
example is that at Bonnay,
where 75 out of the 106 soldiers
buried are Australians. The
cemetery visitors’-book shows
that the villagers are frequent
visitors to the graves. The
Australian Cemetery at
Bapaume, where 74 Australians
are buried, is often visited by
children, who have written such
comments as “We are grateful
to the Australians,” and “I put
some flowers on the graves.”
I think we should be glad
that the bodies of the Diggers
were never taken back to Aus-
tralia —as those of the Ameri-
cans were taken home. The
Yanks are forgotten on the
Somme ; the Diggers never will
be. In any case, these military
cemeteries are tremendously
inspiring and moving, with the
neat headstones row on row,
like soldiers on parade.
I find civilian cemeteries
utterly depressing places, but
Army cemeteries have a quite
different atmosphere, with their
gardens and orderly, unextrava-
gant headstones. Many stones
carry no inscription beyond
the soldier’s name, age, unit
and date of death. But all
might well bear the words on
the headstone of an 18-year-
old Digger in Rue du Bois
Military Cemetery, Fleurbaix,
near Armentieres —“This is a
finer resting-place than even in
Westminster Abbey.”
Apart from the large number
of Diggers in Tyne Cot
Cemetery, others with numer-
ous burials are V.C. Corner
Australian Cemetery, From-
elles, with 410, all unidenti-
fied ; Queant Road Cemetery,
Buissy, near Bapaume, 954;
Warlencourt, near Bapaume,
461 ; Pozieres British, 690;
Serre Rd. No. 2 Cemetery, 699;
Heath Cemetery, Harbonnieres,
near Albert, 958 ; Villers-
Bretonneux, 772; Adelaide
Cemetery, Villers, 519; Vigna-
court, near Amiens, 423;
Peronne Communal Cemetery
Extension, 512; Etaples, 481;
St. Sever Cemetery, Rouen,
895; Buttes New British
Cemetery, in Polygon Wood,
564 ; Hooge Crater Cemetery,
Zillebeke, near Ypres, 509,
and Lijssenthoek Military
Cemetery, near Poperinghe,
1129.
Even now bodies are still
occasionally recovered from
farmers’ fields, but there is
little chance of identifying
them.
No middle-aged Frenchman
or Belgian living on the Somme
or in Flanders is in any doubt
about the role played by the
Diggers. “They always used
the Australians to hold or take
a position beyond the ability
of anybody else to hold or
take,” a Peronne schoolteacher
told me.
“Ah, those Australians!”
said a Customs-officer near
Armentieres, “they always
attacked, always!”

weight before becoming really damp, wool is naturally water-protective and

Pitball
By GEORGE CLIVE
Headquarters of
the South Coast
District of New Britain
appeared to be in a
panic. At short notice, the
District Commissioner, that
remote and powerful figure, had
indicated his intention to
inspect the area.
Laborers and prisoners
tumbled over each other to
realign and rewhiten the stone
borders to the paths and road-
ways. Ragged thatches on the
buildings were evenly trimmed.
Everything visible on the station
was refurbished. The crew of
the Government boat were
being driven savagely by their
fierce chief, the coxswain, on a
rush repainting job.
The news had leaked to the
villages, and for each of the
two days before the great man’s
arrival more than a thousand
volunteers had come casually,
not to offer service, but to take
a part in presenting their
station in the best light.
Between them they gathered
together all rubbish and burnt
it, and undertook the cutting
of five acres of tough, rich,
green grass with sariffs the
New Guinea version of the
sickle —a job which would not
otherwise have been done.
Everyone was pressed to the
limit, but John Sullivan, the
Assistant District Officer in
charge of the station, was con-
fident that order would be
produced from the apparent
chaos before the Commissioner
arrived. Sullivan hardly saw
his house because of continuous
rounds of inspection. Frank
Chard, the only other European
on the station at the time, swept
and garnished his hospital and
its area.
Even Toti, the wise old
Papuan stores-clerk, was kept
frantically busy checking the
issue and return of knives,
spades, brushes, axes and grass-
cutting sariffs. Some nights he
slept in the clerk’s ho,use near
the office, too busy to make the
trip across the bay to his own
house where his young wife
lived.
Among those who had
received very clear orders was
Sergeant Ulilio of the Royal
Papua and New Guinea Con-
stabulary. Sullivan, always
inordinately proud of the smart
turnout of his guard, had told
Ulilio that this Commissioner’s
visit must be freated as some-
thing very special, although it
seemed hardly necessary with
an N.C.O. of Ulilio’s calibre.
When the flying-boat carry-
ing the Commissioner tied-up,
the Old Man stepped out on to
the waiting canoe with a barely-
concealed grin. After all, he had
been through similar frenzied
preparations many times, some
20 years before, but he had
to admit he was impressed by
the neat station and the
immaculate guard -of - honor
which crashed to the “Present”
as he set foot ashore.
“Hmmm,” he remarked, “not
as frightful as I expected. I
think I should do an inspection
of the police. When would it
suit you, John?”
“Tomorrow morning, sir?
Eight o’clock? That’s the
usual.”
“Very well.”
■pIVE minutes before eight the
next morning, Corporal
Semangen and the 25
constables that formed the
detachment stood among the
bushes which surrounded the
office parade-ground.
Each was . giving a final,
furtive polish to his brass-
buckled belt, rubbing an extra
gloss onto the glowing wood-
work of his rifle, or adjusting
for the dozenth time the
formal navy tunic and laplap,
scarlet-edged, worn for such
occasions. Colored croton,
spreading frangipani and vivid
hibiscus screened these activities
from the grassy expanse of the
parade-ground.
Corporal Semangen took his
watch from his ammunition-
pouch and glared at it for the
hundredth time. Still no
sergeant! Two minutes to go!
Semangen, in common with
everyone else on the station,
was in awe of Sullivan’s
eccentric insistence On haying
things done to time. Where the
hell was Ulilio? At 10
seconds to eight, Corporal
Semangen made his decision.
He strode to the middle of the
small parade - ground and
shouted “Marker!”
As he passed between the two
even lines, the Commissioner’s
grey eyes missed nothing. The
bo’ts and magazines of the
rifles, the dress of the detach-
ment, their bearing—-everything
pleased him. His occasional
questions about a man’s name
or place of birth were answered
briefly and grimly by Sullivan,
who followed, pale with fury.
The inspection finished, the
medical assistant claimed the
Commissioner to visit the
hospital. Sullivan, a rare thing
for him, dismissed the police
with an angry gesture and no
word of praise, although the
Commissioner had been more
than satisfied.
As he stalked from the
parade-ground towards his
house, Sullivan’s attention
was caught by unusual sounds
coming from behind the
great bole of a wild
rubber-tree. He stepped off
the path and around the tree.
He stood wordlessly staring at
his sergeant standing naked as
he tried to wring the worst of
the water out of his uniform!
“Well, Ulilio,, the parade's
over!”
The sergeant’s face darkened
with embarrassment. “Sir, 1
know. I ... I was somewhere
else.”
.“I noticed that.” Anger
edged Sullivan’s voice. “Have
you a story?”
“Sir, I don’t think I have
a story.” Ulilio looked every-
where but at his chief.
“Well, / do,” snarled
Sullivan, “and it’s a story I’ll
hear at 10 o’clock in the House
Paper. I’m going to hold an
‘orderly-room’ on this. Be
there in your blues, but,” he
added balefully, “leave your
belt and bayonet outside and,”
turning the knife in the wound,
“don’t be late!”
TN the orderly-room, Sullivan
A was no less savage. It
would have needed a very
exceptional story to excuse the
sergeant’s missing this parade,
and for once Ulilio had no
story.
“Very well, Serg e a n t,”
Sullivan wound-up the pro-
ceedings, “hand me your folder.
Now, first, I’m going to make
a black mark on your record.
Second, no leave for a year.
Third, the special sergeant’s

allowance of tobacco is can-
celled and for six months you
get the same as any constable.
Last, you will do double shifts
of duty for a month and you
are fined five pounds. Bring it
to the office tomorrow. Now,
I have some words for you. Go
down to the wharf where no
man is and wait for me. I
want to talk to you alone.”
On the wharf Sullivan used
the short vicious sentences
which come so easily to
the pidgin language to say
things which could never
have been said in the
formal atmosphere of the
orderly-room. He sent a very
shaken young sergeant about
his duties again.
Sullivan had made a general
call to his officers to gather
at headquarters and meet the
Commissioner. He was pleased
when, 48 hours later, a mission-
trawler secured to his wharf
and Jim Bradshaw stepped
ashore.
When the formalities were
over, the Commissioner
immediately asked, “Who owns
that magnificent canoe?”
“As a matter of fact it
belongs to one of the police-
force. The mission were good
enough to give me a lift and
offered to tow the canoe as
well.”
The Commissioner made
an expert appraisal: the sleek
30ft. length; its beautifully-
carved prowpiece ; the neatness
of the outrigger, and the
slender, long-bladed racing-
paddles.
“Whoever he is, he’s a lucky
man,” he commented.
- “It's Sergeant Ulilio,” Brad-
shaw informed him, with a
glance at Sullivan.
. “Ulilio?” The Commissioner
thought for a moment. “1 saw
his name in the orderly-room
book. By Crikey, John, you
gave him the works!”
“I did,” said Sullivan grimly.
“He missed a parade.”
The Commissioner gave a
bark of laughter. “That’ll
remind me to be on time for
dinner tonight! ”
TTNABLE to stay aw'ay
another second, Ulilio
stepped quietly onto the wharf.
His eyes were round with
delight as he surveyed the
straight, gleaming walnut hull,
finished with craftsmanship
known Only in one tiny corner
of the island.
“Ah!” he murmured. “Now
I’m a man again. I've got a
canoe.”
“ What happened to your little
one?” asked Sullivan.
“Sir, it disappeared. It
wasn’t exactly stolen, but it
was cut loose one night when
I was visiting someone.”
The two men had known
each other too long for either
to nurse a grudge.
“Why didn’t you tell me?”
inquired Sullivan.
“I shouldn’t have been there ;
that’s why I didn’t report it,
but all the same, it’s as if
someone had stolen that canoe.”
“When was this?”
“Two days ago, the morning
I was late for parade. I think
the man who did it must have
known what you would do to
me for being late. It was his
way of backing niy wrong.”
At this calm statement
Sullivan spun on his heel. With
hunched shoulders, hands
thrust deep into the pockets of
his shorts, he started dejectedly
up the hill to his house. In a
moment he felt a hand on his
shoulder. The Commissioner’s
voice, usually abrupt and harsh,
was sympathetic.
“Come off it, John. I know
how you feel. You’ve been used
as somebody’s weapon in a
personal quarrel and you don’t
like it!”
“Too right, I don’t!”
“John, listen. In your area
alone you are the focus of more
than thirty-thousand pairs of
eyes. You’re the man with the
special powers, and naturally
everyone tries to trick you on-
to their side.”
“And they succeed,” added
Sullivan bitterly.
“Not often,” the Com-
missioner grinned tightly. “If
they did, you wouldn’t still be
here. But remember, John, if
you make a mistake, or even
look like making a mistake,
there are literally tens of
thousands of people ready to
try and profit from it.”
“Thank you, sir. That does
help. I didn’t mean to set
myself up as being perfect, but
it’s the idea of being used as
a hired hatchet-man that makes
me so furious.”
r\ESPITE the Commissioner’s
understanding'attitude, the
experience rankled. Sullivan
started a private inquiry. This
led him, some three weeks later,
to call for the old Papuan clerk.
“Toti,” he came straight to
the point, “is it true that some
time ago Ulilio was visiting
your wife?”
“Yes, sir,” replied Toti
calmly. “That’s quite true.”
“And, Toti, one day, when
The Commissioner was here,
somebody cut Ulilio’s canoe
adrift and he missed parade.”
“That was me, sir,” said
Toth without hesitation. “I
didn’t want to be angry with
him. He’s so much bigger than
I am. Where I come from, in
the hills, when we want to
catch a pig we dig a deep hole,
a pitfall, and then we wait for
our pig. This time I waited for
the Commissioner’s parade.”
Sullivan was staggered. “But,
Toti, in this case, I’m one of
your pigs! Having a parade
without the sergeant put me
in a damned awkward posi-
tion.”
“I was always sure you’d be
able to manage something, sir.”
“Umm.” Sullivan paused
thoughtfully. “There’s another
thing that puzzles me. How
could you possibly find out
what happened to Ulilio? After,
all, he’s the sergeant, not just a
constable.”
“I never did find out, sir.”
' “Good heavens!” gasped
Sullivan. “In all these three
weeks haven’t you tried to
find out? You must have been
nearly bursting with curiosity.”
“Not at all, sir” the old
Papuan remarked placidly,
“I’ve always had every con-
fidence in you.”
IN A LATE HOUR
Though ail men should desert
you
My faith will not grow less,
But keep that single virtue
Of simple thankfulness.
Despair had fallen round me,
Dangers had pressed me low.
You sought me and you found
me,
And l will not let you go.
The hearts of men grow colder,
The final things draw near,
Forms vanish, kingdoms
moulder,
The Antirealm is here,
Whose order is derangement —
Close-driven, yet alone.
Men face the last estrangement:
The sense of nature gone.
Though the stars run distracted,
And from wounds deep rancors
flow,
While the mystery is enacted
1 will not let you go.

KASHMIR
By R.R.D.
ON August 13, 1948, the
United Nations Com-
mission for India and
Pakistan (UNCIP), con-
stituted by the Security Council,
published its resolution in an
endeavor to settle the conflict
in Kashmir. It called for the
establishment of a- cease-fire,
detailed proposed truce
arrangements (which required
the withdrawal of all Pakistani
forces from the State and, after
they had gone, the withdrawal
of the bulk of the Indian
forces), and ordained that,
these conditions having been
fulfilled, the future of Jammu
and Kashmir should be deter-
mined in accordance with the
will of the people.
The cease-fire agreement was
eventually implemented; but
that is all that has happened,
despite the subsequent appoint-
ment of a series of United
Nations mediators, and even,
a't one period, direct negotiation
between the two Prime
Ministers, which broke-down
after initial promise of success.
So, for a decade, the United
Nations has let the matter be.
Perhaps they were sitting and
thinkingbut an impartial
observer must be excused for
suspecting that they were just
sitting—hoping, maybe, that
the problem would settle itself.
Then on April 3, 1958, Dr.
Frank P. Graham, the United
Nations representative, pub-
lished the interim report of his
latest mission. He made five
points:
(a) He requested India and
Pakistan to appeal to their respec-
tive peoples to assist in creating 1
and maintaining an atmosphere
favorable to further negotiation.
(b) He called for reaffirmation of
the integrity of the line.
(c) The withdrawal of Pakistani
forces from the State and the
possible stationing of a Vnited
Nations force on the Pakistani side
of the border after completion of
this withdrawal. (A study also to
be made of how the territory
evacuated by Pakistan could be
administered in accordance with
the terms of the original UNCIP
resolution and also of the eventual
withdrawal of the bulk of the
Indian forces.)
(d) The need for holding a
plebiscite under United Nations
auspices.
(e) A proposal for a conference
between the Prime Ministers of
India and Pakistan to be held
under his auspices.
These five points are the out-
come of a sincere attempt to
solve the problem. They pro-
vide no new approach; but,
then, after all these years of
discussion, that is hardly to be
expected. The report stands as
a practicable course of action
and it promises a chance of
success, which could never
eventuate if matters were just
left to drift.
Pakistan accepted the report
in its entirety; India rejected
it completely. India claimed
that, from the outset, Pakistan
has been the aggressor in
Kashmir and that therefore the
whole onus of performance lay
on Pakistan and U.N. At the
same time, it reaffirmed its
determination to promote and
maintain peaceful relations with
Pakistan, while placing its faith
in U.N. and its charter.
This is a case which one is
bound to examine. Sparks left
unextinguished can develop
into a bushfire. Sparks can fly
quickly from such a dispute,
and there is plenty of inflam-
mable material lying about the
world nowadays. Communist
eyes look down hungrily on
the Indian peninsula, the key-
stone of Asia ; and one day,
perhaps, any excuse may prove
better than none for seizing
possession of that land-mass.
Kashmir provides just that
excuse.
Family disputes are generally
unprofitable and often lead to
financial ruin. This dispute
is one between cousins—fellow-
members of the British Com-
monwealth. Pakistan, ad-
mittedly with help from the
Americans, spends at the
moment some £9O million a
year on defence ; that is about
60 p.c. of its national Budget.
It is a member of Seato and of
the Baghdad Pact; but, even
then, the greater part of its
expenditure is due to Kashmir.
India, which gets help not
only from America and the
World Bank but also indus-
trially from , Russia, has
declared that its defence forces
exist only to protect the
frontiers of its own country.
Yet, although it envisages no
external military commit-
ments, its defence expenditure
in 1956-57 (as evidenced by
official figures) was £206
million, although this is only
18 p.c. of its much larger
national Budget. Again the
chief cause of this expenditure
is Kashmir.
These figures speak for them-
selves. If the Kashmir question
were to be settled, then a pro-
portion of this tremendous
expenditure on defence could
be turned by both countries
to more constructive uses.
Imagine how much good the
expenditure of even an extra
£lOO million a year would do to
the agriculture of these
countries, if it could be diverted
from huge defence-votes.
The production of food
for the increasing population of
the world is one of the problems
that still lurk in the back-
ground of our consciousness,
but one day it will face us in
stark reality. Here is a prac-
tical example of two agricul-
tural countries which are mani-
festly not able to pull their full
weight in food - production
because they are hampered by
unproductive expenditure in
defence.
Thus, in the simplest terms,
stands the question of Kashmir
today. This is not the whole
story; but that has been
thrashed-out already in front of
the Security Council, and the
record is there for all to read.
Whatever the rights and wrongs
of the question, this is the
present outcome; and it i s
obvious that this unhappy
dispute should be settled with
all speed.
The U.N, representative has
produced a plan which is work-
able and which offers a hope of
solution. In default of any
better idea, this plan must be
accepted either as it stands or
with practicable and sensible
amendments incorporated, and
it must be implemented with
goodwill by both parties. The
U.N. must be perfectly clear
in its determination to settle
the problem now and with
justice, and to this end it must
be prepared to act firmly;
because the dispute can be
allowed to drag on no longer.
Liverpool Bridge
By “Taffy”
'T'HE long-awaited opening of
A a high-level, two-lane
bridge over George's River at
Liverpool (N.S.W.) was cere-
moniously performed on March
15. Some old soldiers were
present, but I very much doubt
if even one of them regretted
the passing of the rickety, one-
lane wooden structure which,
for want of anything better, had
to serve both military and
civilian needs through the two
world wars and before,
between and after.
To the military, travelling
west over its rattling and groan-
ing timbers meant —apart from
routine duties —either leaving
for active service or going on
home-leave. In either case,
it Was a relief to depart from
Meningitis Flats (which was
the unofficial Digger name for
the Moorebank and Casuia
camps), even temporarily, the
one fear being that the structure
would collapse before the
service - wagon was safely
across.
Travelling east, on the other
hand, the imminent return to
camp —to be roasted ir.
summer and frozen in winter,
or to slither in mud during the
“mild” breaks the troops
prayed (always fervently and
often blasphemously) that the
old rattle-trap would dis-
integrate while they were wait-
ing in the long, one-way queue
which was an almost permanent
feature of both approaches, not
only during World War II but
also during World War I. Even
then the bridge was nearly
20 years old, and was suffer-
ing from overstraining.
During a part of World War
11, as an instructor in military
demolitions, it was my job
to take the troops down
to the bridge and to teach them
the technique for its destruc-
tion by explosives. For such
exercises it was customary (and
even almost obligatory) to
follow the precepts laid-down
in the Royal Engineers’ Pocket
Book. In spite" of the fact that
little of the R.E.P.B. had been
revised since the Crimean war
it was a useful compilation for
the destruction of sound struc-
tures (such as those fabricated
by Fritz in France), provided an
abundance of high-explosive
was readily available. When
this was in short sup*ply, how-
ever —as it often was during
World War II —any interpre-
tation of the lavish R.E.P.B.
formulae had to be done with
gumption.
In the case of the Liverpool
bridge, I drew-up a scheme,
making allowance for the
decrepitude of the timbers,
which required less than a
quarter of the amount of gun-
cotton demanded under
R.E.P.B. rules. I little realised
that the High Brass, even in
the Australian R.E.s, regarded
the Pocket Book as sacrosanct
and less liable to change than
the laws of the Medes and
Persians.
For my temerity I was
sharply rapped over the
knuckles by a V.I. (Army
Engineer) P. Later, a most
intelligent officer-student of
mine (who, despite his intelli-
gence, became a full colonel)
was called before a court-of-
inquiry for suggesting that the
Liverpool bridge could be
demolished by “two men with
two sharpr axes and half-an-hour
of non-interference.”


SPORTING NOTIONS
YOUR SHOUT!
AND IT'S
RED MILL RUM.
Sydney Racing
The progeny of Bold
Buccaneer (imp.) continue to
do well. Two more Sydney
wins were added to his list at
City Tattersall’s meeting at
Randwick when Sea Hound
and Bold Colleen won the first
two races. Oldest of the Bold
Buccaneers are racing in their
first season. They also include
winners Bold Pilot, Ginger Nell
and Brisbane’s Tobermory
Bay. Sea Hound cost 1500gns.
as a yearling, but Oakleigh
studmaster T. L. Flynn
accepted a modest 170gns. for
Bold Colleen. It was the bid
of her trainer, Bert Belling-
ham, who had a change of
luck when the filly finished
strongly to beat the better-
fancied Golden Fable and rank
outsider Gabrielle in the
maiden event for two-ycar-old
fillies.
• • • •
New Zealanders have done
well in the longer-distance
Australian handicaps in recent
seasons, and a few top gallopers
will probably come across for
the rich spring races later in
the year. One of their best
stayers, Red Eagle, has arrived
at Randwick and will be trained
by Dick Roden for Mrs. M.
Cameron. Red Eagle, a four-
year-old gelding by Revelation
(imp.) from Lady Cometary by
Balloch (imp.) from Cometary
by Day Comet (imp.), has had
27 starts for 11 wins, seven
seconds and three thirds, and
has been successful to two
miles. Before coming to
Sydney he won the Auckland
Cup (two miles), equalling the
Dominion timeTrecord. His
main mission in the winter
season will probably be the
Brisbane Cup (June 16).
The A.J.C. experimented
with quinellas on the final four
races at Randwick on Saturday,
and the scheme proved success-
ful—for its first day! Holding
on the concluding event, £7700,
Was good, but this quinella has
always been a popular medium.
The leading club would gain
many more patrons for
quinellas, doubles and jack-
pots if the unit was framed on
a ss. basis, as originally decided.
Maybe in the near future this
will be decided upon. Clubs
are losing money by not return-
ing to the dollar betting-scheme.
There’s not the money about
for racing now, and an all-
round reduction in costs would
bring more patrons to tracks.
Two favorites won at City
Tattersall’s meeting at Rand-
wick —one more than at the
corresponding fixture last
season. Punters don’t seem to
have much luck at these fix-
tures. Bookmakers had a
successful day when the final
two races went to rank out-
siders. Grey Magic, at 50’s,
won the Novice from two
“roughies,” Antwerp- and
Staride, while Zaheida, at 33’s,
landed the Club Welter from
well-fancied Beau Brance and
the 66-to-l Go Lightly. Grey
Magic hadn’t won for the
best part of 12 months, and
her most recent run was far
from encouraging. \
Three days before he won
the Welter at Randwick at 33
to 1 Zaheida had been well
backed for the Canterbury
Welter and beat three home.
That poor display, on top of
earlier poor form, was no
incentive for punters to have
anything to do with Zaheida,
who hadn’t won a race for
the best part of a year. There’s
a racing saying, “Follow form
and go broke” —which cer-
tainly applies in some cases.
Incidentally, Randwick attend-
ance (28,000) equalled last
year’s, which was pleasing;
crowds recently have been
down in numbers.
Winner of City Tattersall’s
Maiden Handicap, Lady
Damnos, wasn’t offered as a
yearling at the Randwick sales
in 1956. She was bred by
Woodlands Stud, Denman, and
is by Damnos (imp.) from My
Eva by Hellespont (imp.)
from Nutalli by Magpie (imp.).
Best-performed among her
relatives was Winooka (A.J.C.
Doncaster, Caulfield Futurity
Stakes and other top races and
a winner in America). Her
half-brother by Newtown
Wonder was sold at the recent
Randwick yearling-sales for
2200gns. to trainer Harry
Plant.
The Ezra Norton colors are
having a run of luck. Straight
Draw carried them to victory
in the Sydney Cup, while in the
past couple of weeks Theodric
has won twice and Praetorian
also has been successful. It
wouldn’t surprise if both
Praetorian and Theodric prove
good staying propositions in
the coming season; they could
get in the big money in the
spring round. Theodric had
an easy win in City Tatter sail’s
Autumn Handicap, main
distance-event at the Randwick
fixture.
Horses might be able to con-
cede weights to opponents but
they can’t give big starts. This
was noticed when Radius was
beaten into third place in the
Maiden Handicap at Randwick.
"Show-off!"
One of the two topweights,
Radius was well-fancied by his
trainer, Ray Cashman, who
was surprised to see the geld-
ing slow to settle-down and
last in the first part of the mile.
He was still one of the rear-
guard half-a-mile from home,
but he then settled-down to
a strong finish and managed
to run into third place.
Chief among Tattersall’s
(Sydney) centenary celebrations
next month will be its race-
meeting at Randwick on Satur-
day, May 10, when the seven-
event programme will include
the £3BOO Centenary Cup (li
miles). This is a star attraction
for a May meeting in Sydney.
Five of the other races are
worth £lOOO each and the Fly-
ing £l2OO. Entries will close
on Monday next, April 28.
Owners of middle-distance
gallopers should make most of
an opportunity to win a rich
early-winter prize, and the Cup
is expected to attract a top field.
The two-year-old race will be
run at one mile and should give
youngsters with staying poten-
tial a chance to indicate classic
chances in the three-year-old
season. 1
Leading Sydney jockey
Neville Sellwood will be able
to take mounts at the Brisbane
Cup carnival, and at any
fixtures from May 30. He is
particularly fit and looking
forward to a return to the
saddle. Sellwood had his six
months’ suspension reduced by
one month by the A.J.C. com-
mittee, following a letter he
wrote to the club-secretary ask-
ing that some portion of the
penalty be remitted as an act of
clemency. The committee
decided to reduce the term. The
suspension was imposed follow-
ing an incident in a Randwick
race on Jan. 1.

Racing must be in a pretty
healthy condition when buyers
can be found for 589 yearlings
at one sale. This happened at
William Inglis and Son’s Rand-
wick • auction. An Australian
record aggregate, 415,915gn5.,
was paid for the youngsters,
and the average (706gns.) was
the highest in yearling history.
Of the 734 catalogued, 73 were
withdrawn and 72 were passed
in for private treaty, as the
reserve wasn’t reached. Seven
of the yearlings realised up-
wards of 4000gns.

raced by H. Porter, L. V. Boot

Iran (imp.), a Bois Roussel
stallion, has sired many
winners in Queensland. Two
more were added to his total
when Wigtown won Albion
Park’s Two-year-old Handicap
and Beau Iran the following
event, the Maiden Handicap.
Wigtown was a rank outsider,
but Beau Iran was well fan-
cied. Wigtown’s dam, High
Pride, was foaled in 1944 and
got by High Road from Martle
Pride by Natural Pride, trac-
ing back to Son of a Gun.

Curiously, moderate horses
hold the time-record for most
distances at Caulfield. As an
example, before Saturday’s
racing, record-holders for flat
races at six, seven and 10
furlongs and for two miles
were: For both six and seven
furlongs, Sir Pyrean ; for the
mile, Plato; for 10 furlongs,
Livorno; and for the two
miles, Beaupa. Plato was not
much short of top-class, but
the other three were moderates.
• • • •
The point of that par. is that
the two-miles record for Caul-
field was broken on Saturday
when Storm Warning won the
St. Kilda Handicap. Storm
Warning ran the distance in
3.21 f, and shattered Beaupa’s
time of 3.24 1-10. The winner
is a four-year-old chestnut
entire by Sun Storm from
Donna Vectis ; he vhad never
previously won a metropolitan
race, and his form has been
such that he has been handi-
capped on 7st. for the Adelaide
Cup. Well back at the half-
mile, Storm Warning finished
with great dash. .
Confectionery - manufacturer
Gordon Hoadley had to show
rare patience before his faith
in Watch Out was vindicated.
Hoadley. bought the dapple-
colored grey in N.Z. three years
ago, believing that Watch Out
(by Moorcock from Highland
Watch) would develop into a
good stayer. He has stuck to
that opinion although in many
starts the grey had won only
one small race for him prior
to this autumn. Now he has
won two in a row. He shaped
like a good horse in winning
the 10-furlongs Narong Handi-
cap at Caulfield on Saturday.
A five-year-old, bred to stay,
Watch Out’s mission this
autumn is the Adelaide Cup,
and he looks an ideal type to
run the two miles of the Cup.

Racing in Sydney last spring,
N.Z.-bred Young Idealist
found the company of Tulloch
and Prince Darius too rich.
He is more at home among
the three-year-olds racing in
Melbourne at present. Under
Jack Godby’s care he has won
at his last two starts. He
impressed in winning the first
division of the six-furlongs
Chairman’s Stakes at Caulfield.
At the furlong-post, Tirage
was a good three lengths clear
and seemed to have the race
won. As usual with her, Tirage
stopped suddenly, and Young
Idealist, finishing strongly,
won with a length and a half
to spare. Godby has now
added Young Idealist to the
team he will take to Adelaide
for the big Morphettville meet-
ing next month.
• • • •
There is *no doubt that N.Z.-
bred Lord is above average.
Winner of the Victoria Handi-
cap at his previous start, he put
up a remarkable performance
to win the second heat of the
Chairman’s Stakes at Caulfield.
Burdened with 9.7, he con-
ceded from 101 b. to 341 b. to his
opponents, started from the
outside of the 14 runners,
lugged badly in the straight
because of a twisted bit, and
still won going away. Although
Lord has had only a light
season, his owner, W. R. Kem-
ball, has decided to spell him
immediately. Possibly he fears
that the gelding will get
crippling weights ; but in the
spring Lord should be good
enough for the best company
in the land.
.Planetoid’s win in the seven-
furlongs Katandra Two-year-
old at Caulfield stirred up a
rather unpleasant demonstra-
tion. There was no justifica-
tion for the outburst. Certainly
Planetoid had been defeated at
2-to-l-on the Saturday before,
but, though he ran only third,
he was a bare neck from the
winner. He was defeated in
that race by two top-class
youngsters, Naecon and Mon-
asterevan. Naecon was again
in the field last Saturday, but
the race was over an extra
furlong, which was just too far
for him. The rest of the field
was well below Planetoid’s
class, and the only extra-
ordinary feature of his win was
his starting-price—l 3 to 2.
The Empyrean colt has never
been out of a place, and his
record this time up is three
wins from' four starts.
• * • •
Mention was made here last
week of Proponder’s extra-
ordinary performance when he
won a race after
dislodging his rider and gallop-
ing for nine furlongs. That was
Proponder’s first city win, but
there is no doubt he is a par-
ticularly smart galloper. He
won again at Caulfield last
Saturday. He met a better-class
field, but again led from end to
end, and cut out the six furlongr
of the South Yarra Handicap
in the good time of l.lOf-. Now
a four-year-old, he has been
lightly raced -10 starts for six
wins.
Tomorrow (Thursday) at the
Albury Showgrounds, the Glen-
croft Stud, situated at Wodonga
(Vic.), will go under the
hammer. Former top-class
jockey Ted McMenamin, who
has run the stud since 1950,
is shifting back to Randwick,
where his principal patrons will
be Stan Wootton and R. F.
Moses. Chief interest in the
sale will centre around Tip the
Bottle, the English sire bought
by Wootton on McMenamin’s
behalf for 8000gns. The 1955
edition of the English Race
Horses described Tip the Bottle
as England’s best handicappcr
up to seven furlongs high
praise, indeed. Twenty-six
brood-mares, three racehorses
and four unraced youngsters
will be offered at the sale.
Trotting
The idol of Sydney trotting
fans, champion mare Sibelia
(from 24yds. behind) ran the
fastest race of her career when
she won the 111-furlongs
Harold Park Invitation Thou-
sand in 3min. 4!sec. A length
back was Diabolo Don (scr.),
with Victory Dale (scr.) a
further 1-} lengths away. Sur-
prisingly starting at 5 to 1,
Sibelia bettered Ribands’
record (set in 1953) by fsec.
Sibelia’s mile-rate of 2.5 f was
|sec. faster than Ribands’.
Sibelia was driven a mas-
terly race by trainer-driver
J. D. Watts. The mare was
eighth in the field of 11 for
two laps and then improved
to be fifth at the “bell,” one
lap from the finish. With half-
a-lap to go she had moved into
third position behind Diabolo
Don and Malniri. Diabolo
Don led into the straight, but
had no chance with the cham-
pion when the pressure was
applied.
Sibelia will go for a well-
earned spell after contesting
the Free-for-All' tomorrow
night (Thursday). The crowd
of 17,000-odd gave Sibelia a
tumultuous ovation.
Diabolo Don, after seven
straight wins at Harold Park,
ran a great race in his first
test in open company. The
crowd roared with excitement
as they saw “The Don” in the
lead at the turn into the
straight, to be downed only
by a record-breaking cham-
pion. Malniri, who made
most of the pace, weakened
into sixth place.

Graham, who couldn’t do a
thing wrong—he kicked two
goals, four penalties and one
field-goal, as well as kicking
beautifully for the line —and
big left-winger John Law, who
doesn’t look a footballer for
about 77min. of a game but
who in the remaining time can
be a match winner ; he scored
two dashing tries in under
smin. just before half-time to
put Gordon in winning vein.
Law’s red-bearded opponent,
Newman, couldn’t stop him
once he got moving. ’Varsity
held Gordon for most of the
first half, but lost two good
men, and, though they were
replaced, a lot of the Students’
effectiveness went off the field
with them.
In the other games East over-
whelmed a weakened Randwick
37-8 ; Manly whitewashed East-
wood 33-0, after a close first-
half; St. George drummed
Drummoyne 25-15 , and Parra-
matta surprised North 16-6.

scored six tries, though their
form, too, was far from top-
rate.

In round two of the V.F.L.
Melbourne thrashed Geelong
17.8-6.6 —and it happened
down at Kardinia Park; too.
But Geelong, inexperienced and
rebuilding, is not the all-
conquering side of a few years
ago. In their only clash last
year, too, on the M.C.G., Mel-
bourne administered a like
thrashing, 23.16-14,10. There
Was another “away” victory
on Saturday, when North,
which had been beaten to a
frazzle by Fitzroy in the first
round, ups and downs Carlton
at Prince’s Park in a close
game by six points, 11.7-9.13.
Fitzroy, with a brilliant
centre-line in action, beat
South 11.18-I0.l5; South
fought back well in the last
quarter. St. Kilda brilliantly
defeated Essendon 17.18-11.16
-—it was St. Kilda’s first win
over the Dons since 1942! In
another high-scoring game
Richmond was seven clear
goals in front of Footscray,
21.12-14.12. Hawthorn has
never beaten Collingwood at
Victoria Park —but on Satur-
day went very close to it.
After being down 9.6-5.6 at
threequarter-time, ’Wood just
got there in a gripping finish,
11.9-10.8.

competition is divided into two
sections, with eight teams each;
teams in each section will play
each other twice, and in the
last four rounds teams will
meet opponents from the other
section. Incidentally, Mor-
dialloc won its first V.F.A.
game by a mere one point
from experienced and heavier
Camberwell, while Dandenong,
defeated by Oakleigh by 33
points in a good game in the
first round, beat Mordialloc on
Saturday.
“Bicky”: Newly appointed
captain of Collingwood, Frank
Tuck has his brother Anthony
playing with Collingwood this
season. Vice-captain Murray
Weideman’s brother Peter is
also donning a black-and-white

Magpie tradition, for over the
years there has always been at
least one pair of brothers on
the Collingwood training-list.
Some famous Magpie brothers
that come to mind are Gordon

Ron Richards, Bobby and Bill
Rose, Bill, Pat and Mick
Twomey, and Leeta and Harry

Boxing’s Melba, welter -
weight Darby Brown, is going
all right so far in what is his
fourth or fifth comeback. On
Mar. 24 he beat Ray Richards
on a t.k.o. in the seventh,
and on April 14 stopped Billy
Stanley in the ninth ; in both
fights the losers had badly cut
eyes. On March 3, Stanley was
only just beaten by Billy Todd
for the national welter title,
and Brown’s clear-cut win
seems to give him a very good
chance of recapturing the title
which he previously held after
defeating George Barnes.
“Keima”: Australian
featherweight champion Bobby
Sinn recently announced his
retirement because of the
breakdown of a nerve in the
right eye. Bobby Sinn turned
professional in 1950 after
winning, at 17, the Queensland
Golden Gloves (7.6 class) in
.1949. He won the Australian
bantamweight title in May,
1953, and the featherweight
title in November, 1955; he
lost the bantam title to Kevin
James in December, 1955.
But his finest hour was his fight
with then world bantamweight
champion Jimmy Carruthers
in Sydney in March, 1954,
when he came close to
knocking-out Carruthers.

“E.A.8.”: Who would be
Australia’s outstanding athlete?
Names that immediately occur
are Snowy Baker (boxer, horse-
man, surfer, lftesaver and the
rest) and Frank Beaurepaire,
who, as far as I know, was a
swimmer only, but who
retained world class longer
than anyone else. A fellow-
Tasmanian who comes to mind
was Audie Stuart, a fine speci-
men of manhood, over 6ft. tall
and weighing about 14st. He
was a first-class rower, yachts-
man, swimmer, cricketer, foot-
u a ii Pr r :flp an H
oaller ’ rifle-shot, boxer and
runner. I remember he came
third in an ill-fated Mount
Wellington race which took
place on the coldest day I have
ever experienced, in the winter
of 1903. In this race, two men
died on the track, which was
covered in places with 3ft. of
snow. Stuart was then about
45 and up to the date of his
death, at about 75, carried
himself as straight as a die.

What is the Federation of British
Industries ? What are some of its
activities?
It is “a voluntary association of
manufacturers and producers for
the promotion of their several and
mutual interests, governed by an
annually-elected Grand Council.”
Established in 1916, and granted A
Royal Charter of Incorporation in
1924, the federation exists to
encourage and develop British
manufactures, and to safeguard
the interests of British producers
both at home and abroad. Entirely
non-political, the F.BJ. collates the
views of manufacturers on such
points as taxation, factory-legisla-
tion, shipping-freights, smoke-
abatement and river-pollution, and
also assists its members by giving
advice on numerous trade points,
among which are advertising, con-
tracts, Customs, exhibitions (the
British • Industries Fair is held
annually in London and Birming-
ham), fuel-economy, insurance and
overseas markets. Four publications
are issued: the F.BJ. Register (the
official list of members, and a
comprehensive list of manufac-
turers, with a list of products)*;
British Industries (a monthly organ,
having a taxation-supplement and
an economic supplement); the
annual Fuel Economy Review and
the quarterly F.BJ. Business
Barometer.

What is the distinction between
“rights” and “privileges" ?
A privilege is "something pecu-
liar to one or some as distinguished
from others; a prerogative.” Thus,
the term should be employed rela-
tively. “The rights and privileges
of the people,” as often used
absolutely in political platforms,
demagogical speeches and radical
newspapers, is incorrect, since the
people in this sense can have no
privileges, i.e., "things pecuhar
to individuals.” Milton's use is
correct when he says, "We do not
mean to destroy ail the people’s
tights and privileges," since he’s
speaking of fhe people relatively,
as distinguished from the magis-
trates and the King.
* * * *
Some details of the elk ?
The elk, or moose (A Ices male his),
is the largest living species of
forest-deer; in the Old Wttrld it’s
known as the eik, but in America
as the moose. The elk can be
found all over the forested regions
to the north of Europe and Asiatic
Russia; it is protected by laws,
and carefully preserved. Every-
man's says it is easily tamed and
has often been trained to draw
sleighs. Antlers, found on the
male only, have their basal por-
tion, which is in the form of a
short cylinder, in the same plane
as the forehead. The base expands
into a huge broad “palm,” at the
edge of which are short branches.
Height at the shoulders is about
6ft. Duirng the breeding-season
males fight with great fury, inflict-
ing such wounds with their horns
that the combats frequently result
in death,
* * * *
How are icebergs formed? What
precautions are taken against them
by shipping?
An iceberg can be defined as a
hill of ice. Rising often as much
as 270 ft. above the sea, it is'a
floating mass which has broken
away from some glacier or ice-
sheet in the Polar regions, and
which drifts away from its frozen
home into warmer and navigable
“ Saddle-sore !”
waters. When the iceberg first
breaks away, the fracture is green
or blue; when it comes. within
view of whalers or other vessels,
however, its cliff-like faces and
pinnacles glisten with a dazzling
white, in its initial movement, the
iceberg strews the seabed with
pebbles, rocks, etc.; as- it enters
warmer zones it melts, disintegrates,
tilts and often overturns. From
the specific gravity of ice, it 'is
calculated that only one-ninth of
an iceberg appears above the sur-
face of the water. Since the ill-
fated Titanic hit an iceberg, an
International Iceberg Patrol has
been maintained jointly by Britain
and the,.U.S., and operated by the
U.S, Coastguard Patrol for the
location and destruction of ice-
bergs. From February for about
three months the movements of
some thousands of icebergs are
plotted, and positions are radioed
to shipping. Any ship sighting an
iceberg must report its position.
* * * *
How are teachers appointed in
Britain ? What's the position as
to training-colleges ?
(From Britain: An Official Hand-
book, 1956.) Teachers are appointed
by local education-authorities or
school governing-bodies or man-
agers. In England, Wales and
Northern Ireland they are not
subject to official control on ques-
tions relating to curricula or
methods. In Scotland, schemes
of work in primary and secondary
'departments are subject to the
approval of Government
inspectors, and no pupil may be
presented for the Scottish Leav-
ing Certificate examination unless
he has followed a course approved
by the Scottish Education Depart-
ment.
In 1954 there was one full-time
teacher to 27 pupils in publicly-
maintained primary and secondary
schools in England and Wales; the
figure was 24 for Scotland and 30
for Northern Ireland. The high
birthrate at the end of World War
II is the chief of several factors in
the present need for more teachers.
Teachers’ training-colleges in
England and Wales number 154.
The usual training-course lasts for
two years, but there are three-
year courses for women taking
housecraft or physical education.
There are 23 university departments
of education providing a one-year
course for graduates. In Scotland
there are four general training,
centres, two denominational train-
ing-colleges and a college f o j
women teachers of physical educa-
tion. Courses are normally of one
year’s duration for graduates or
the equivalent, and ot three years
for non-graduates. Northern Ire.
land has two general teacher-
training collges, one university
training - department and three
specialist colleges—one for train-
ing teachers of physical education
one for teachers of domestic-science
and one for teachers of art. The
basic course in the general training,
colleges lasts three years.
The Education Departments, the
universities, local education-authori-
ties and other bodies provide a
variety of short courses for prac-
tising teachers. Teachers front
schools in the United Kingdom go
to a number of overseas countries
each year under interchange-
schemes or schemes for temporary
overseas posts.

UNCABLED
ADDITIONS
CANADIAN ELECTIONS
CONSERVATIVE eyes in
the U.K. and Australia
must have looked with a
measure of envious admiration
at the Canadian Conserva-
tive Party’s 209-to-56 victory in
the Canadian elections. Prime
Minister John Diefenbaker’s
crusading an d convincing
enthusiasm is no doubt a good
overall explanation for his win
—“a sure friend in uncertain
times” might be a fair descrip-
tion of his appearance to the
electors —and, as may be
recalled from the Truman vic-
tory which so completely upset
the prophecies of the public-
opinion pollsters, there’s noth-
ing like a good, fighting leader
to win an election. ,
Within that general picture
U.K. and U.S. editorial press-
comment submits a variety of
other reasons for the Con-
servative victory :
London “Daily Telegraph”:
‘‘Several factors worked to-
gether to produce this mightiest
landslide in Canada’s electoral
history. One of the strongest,
though least susceptible 'to
precise evaluation, was
undoubtedly the sense of fair
play. Canadians decided last
year that it was "time for a
change from the long Liberal
regime; but although they
turned the Liberals out they
failed effectively to put the
Conservatives in. This time,
they have resolved to give the
latter a real chance ; and Mr.
Diefenbaker made doubly sure
of it by choosing, as is a Prime
Minister’s right, a tactically
favorable moment for the dis-
solution.”
The same: “The crippling
numerical weakness of the
Opposition may be regrettable
from the standpoint o f
balanced Parliamentary debate;
but Mr. Diefenbaker seems a
man likely to regard his
triumph as a challenge to
statesmanship rather than as a
licence to override reasoned
criticism.”
# * *
London “Financial Times”:
“The recession, too, gave new
point to the Conservative aim
of making Canada less com-
pletely dependent on the state
of business in the United
States. Government spokes-
men were able to make some
play with the popular measures
they have already taken —tax-
cuts, higher pensions and
larger subsidies to the
provinces. Above all, perhaps,
Mr. Diefenbaker’s personal
enthusiasm aroused a general
feeling that his Administration
deserved the absolute majority
which would give him freedom
to put his ideas into practice.”
* * *
London “Daily Mail” : “Now
he [Diefenbaker] is set for at
least five years of power. It
will be a crucial lustrum in the
history of a country whose
feet are on the path to wealth
and world power. It is this
trend which has given the Con-
servatives their sweeping
success. Canada, aware of her
nationhood as never before, has
voted for the nationalism of
Mr. Diefenbaker in preference
to the internationalism of Mr.
Lester Pearson, the Liberal
leader.”
"Manchester Guardian” ; “It
is his [Diet'enbaker's] fervent
preaching of a vivid Canadian
nationalism which has excited
the electorate in a way that
Mr. Pearson’s carefully
reasoned appeals could not.
Each of these two men has
increased Canada’s stature in
the world at large, but there is
a vast difference between their
methods. As Secretary of
State for External Affairs, Mr.
Pearson taught his countrymen
to think for themselves on inter-
national matters, to follow
slavishly neither the views of
London nor those of Washing-
ton, and appre-
ciate the feelings and hopes of
the smaller countries, and to
uphold the principle of inter-
national law and order for the
mighty as well as the weak.
He made his country respected
far and wide.
“Mr. Diefenbaker’s nation-
alism has been concerned much
more with economics. He has
been horrfied by the economic
dependence of Canada on the
United States, by the control
through ownership of common
stock which United States
citizens have over a great part
of Canadian industry, and by
what must sometimes have
seemed the callous way in which
the United States often has
put restrictions on Canadian
exports.
“He wants to limit the per-
centage of common stocks
which may be held by United
States citizens ; he is trying to
switch more and more Canadian
imports from the United States
to Britain and the Common-
wealth ; he is said to have talked
even of a conference in Ottawa
between Commonwealth Prime
Ministers and Mr. Khrushchev
(at which he does not care
greatly whether the United
States is represented) as a
result of which peace will be
secured and Canada will
develop flourishing trade with
China and Russia. In his

London “Daily Express” :
“At this moment Canada’s
relations with the United States
are strained. In every province
of the Dominion the Canadian
electorate has expressed dis-
satisfaction with American
policy.
“The Canadians resented the
ban on the export of 1000 Ford
vehicles to China, a ban im-
posed by Washington at a time
when many Canadians were
out of work. They showed
too their violent dislike of
American restrictions on the
import of Canadian oil; and of
the devastating damage the
United States has done to
Canadian export - sales of
wheat.
“These were not, of course,
the sole issues of the election.
However, the Americans must
take a share of responsibility
for creating this trouble for
themselves. Now it is the duty
of their Government to re-
adjust U.S. trade-relations with
Canada.”
* * *
* “New York Times”: “He
[Diefenbaker] made a special
point in his campaign of ‘pr&-
serving for the people of
Canada control of their own
economic and political destiny.’
In this connection he has
advocated tax and other adjust-
ments to put Canadian and
American —.
investors on a more equal foot-
ing, to secure for Canadians
stock-participation and execu-
tive positions in foreign enter-
prises in Canada and to give
the latter more export business.
“These proposals are not
born of anti-American senti-'
ments but are tokens of a new
stirring in a progressively self-
conscious Canada, proud of its
growth and anxious to spread
its wings.”
Britain and Germany
Some sect i o n s of the
U.K. press are not slow
to hold-up Germany’s post-
war recovery as an example of
what Britain could and should
be doing, the implication
usually being that the hard-
working German, under a
vigorous “private-enterprise”
Government, is the backbone
of a flourishing economy,
while Britain, under a weak
Government, is bogged down
in varying forms and degrees
of Socialism and industrial
troubles.
As in most facile com-
parisons, there is a convenient
element of truth on both sides
—and just as much conveniently
left unsaid.
A fairer, if unintentional,
comparison is provided by
editorial assessments of
Germany and Britain by the
New York “Herald Tribune”
and “Yorkshire Post” respec-
tively.
The “Herald Tribune,” look-
ing at Germany’s recovery
from an “economic wasteland”
in 1947, sees it now as a country
with a gross national product
of $46,000 million, and one
which “has taken a respected
place in the councils of the
free world an invaluable
member of the European Pay-
ments Union, the Coal and
Steel Community, the burgeon-
N.Y. “Herald Tribune ”
“COULD YOU HOLD-OFF UP THERE UNTIL I SEE
WHERE I AM?”
ing Common Market and
Nato.”
This, the same paper
comments, has been accom-
plished by adding something
“to the innate ability of the
German people to work their
passage back to solvency,” the
additional ingredients being,
mainly, the leadership of two
men:
“Chancellor Adenauer, over
the past decade, has contributed
democratic, European-minded
political statesmanship. Vice-
Chancellor Ludwig Erhard, in
the same period, has given free
enterprise economic leader-
ship of the highest order.
“The Vice - Chancellor, a
courageous, ebullient, intelligent
economist who has been able
to translate classic theory into
vital fact, has crammed a long
record of achievement into his
10 years of economic leader-
ship. It was he who, with
American support, pushed-
through the needed devaluation
of the mark ; he who took what
seemed to be the long chance
of abolishing rationing in
1948.
“A convinced believer in
enlightened capitalism, Dr.
Erhard has slashed tariffs on
imports (40 per cent, in the
last two years); obtained
legislation to abolish cartels
and to restore the manufacture
of the Volkswagen to private
ownership. His goal in inter-
national finance is the restora
tion of convertibility to the
world’s currencies; he fears
lest the Common Market plan
turn into a Western European
cartel on a huge scale, and
prefers the utmost extension of
freer trade.
“In all of this Dr. Erhard
has broken with the trend of
German official economics
since Friedrich List and Bis-
marck —a trend which reached
its climax in the brown Bol-
shevism of the Nazis. He has
also run counter to the soci-
alisation and nationalisation
which marked so much of the
post-war world. And the
fruits of his policy are demon-
strably good. They offer a
lesson to every nation struggling
with economic problems, just
as his personal approach —‘we
have met all crises head-on and
have always sought to solve
them by steaming straight
ahead’ —should be an inspira-
tion to every national leader.
Dr. Erhard and Chancellor
Adenauer are more than
national assets for West
Germany. The two form a
moral bastion of the free
world.”
The foregoing American
opinion of Germany-'
commonly supported by almost
any newspaper editorial
care to read —is a fair-enough

picture of one side of the
UK.-Germany comparison. It
is the other side—the side
w hich whales into poor old
John Bull —which often calls
for correction, or at least quali-
fication. A drop of that much-
needed modification is con-
tained in the “Yorkshire Post”
editorial prompted by the latest
“Monthly Bulletin for Industry”
issued by the U.K. Treasury.
This bulletin shows, the
“Yorkshire Post” comments,
“that production has risen by
one-third in the past decade”:
“Britain is not failing to
respond to the opportunities
presented by technological
advance. She is not living in
the past or taking no heed oT
changing world conditions.
Her exports are double their
pre-war level ; and, more signi-
ficant, her share in world trade
in important commodities such
as electrical machinery,
passenger-cars and tractors has
increased very substantially.
And ‘we have kept our long
lead in the woollen and worsted
trade and continue to supply
about half the world’s markets.’
“Much attention is rightly
paid both on the public plat-
form and in our newspapers
to any threat of strikes that
might impede the fulfilment of
export-orders. But here again
Britain’s record bears com-
parison with those of some of
her keenest industrial rivals.
“This may surprise many
people. The facts deserve to
be publicised. American
workers lost eight times as
much work through strikes
between 1951 and 1954 as our
own in Britain; Frenchmen
lost three-and-a-half times as
much. In West Germany the
records were better, but since
the second quarter of last year
Britons have been putting in
slightly longer hours than the
West Germans, who are so
often held-up as patterns oi
industry.
“Our recent achievements in
the application of nuclear power
to industrial uses, in the
development of turbine-
powered air-liners and in the
successful experiment that has
turned Zeta into a household
word, are widely known.”
There is another point, the
“Yorkshire Post” comments,
which “puzzles many people
and is a constant source of diffi-
culty in winning acceptance
for vitally-necessary economic
policies”:
“Since this country [Britain]
is accomplishing so much, since
we are breaking records with
the sale of our exports, and
since our traders have earned
abroad a surplus of well over
£lOOO million in the past six
years, why is there so much talk
of danger and crisis?
“When the man in the street,
of at the factory-bench hears
one day of Britain's splendid
achievements and is told the
next that we are faced with a
threat to tne pound, he becomes
suspicious. ‘lt sounds queer to
me,’ he says. ‘lf we’re selling
all these goods abroad, why
should we be faced with such
anxieties? It doesn’t seem to
make sense.’
“This very question is
discussed in an article in the
"Washington Post "
ARABIAN NIGHTS
current issue of the ‘Round
Table,’ the quarterly review of
British Commonwealth affairs.
The ‘Round Table’ points to
the facts just cited from the
‘Bulletin for Industry’: the rise
in output, the expansion of
exports, the impressive surplus
in the balance of payments on
current account. ‘As a trader,’
it says, ‘Britain has been
brilliantly successful in the post-
war world. But where are the
benefits of this success? Why
are the reserves still at such a
perilously low level? Is the
answer that Britain, though
successful as a trader, has failed
as a banker?’
“As if in answer to this last
inquiry, the bulletin itself
draws attention to the respon-
sibilities which this country's
role of world banker confers.
‘To support a currency in which
nearly half the world’s trade
and payments is done on less
than four per cent, of the
world’s exchange reserves is no
sinecure,’ it comments,
“That is putting it mildly.
As the ‘Round Table’ says
frankly, ‘even if we were to
double the size of the reserves
we should still have only about
eight per cent, of the currency-
reserves of the world. Yet on
this precarious support, like an
inverted pyramid, balances
virtually the whole of the
world’s clearing mechanism.
For it is not only a matter of
the sterling area’s trade, but in
addition, since sterling is inter-
nationally acceptable, it is used
to clear the outstanding
indebtedness between most
countries and currency-areas
in the world.’
“What, then, should be done?
After a long and careful review
of the whole situation the
‘Round Table’ recalls Sir
Oliver Franks’s recent appeal
for fresh support from abroad
for the central reserves. It
says: ‘Considering the con-
tribution that the sterling-area
system makes to the mainte-
nance of a high level of inter-
national trade (as an interna-
tional clearing mechanism and
as an alternative currency-
medium to gold) it has always
been remarkable that it should
have received so little
encouragement or even recogni-
tion from the United States.’
“The time certainly seems
ripe,” the “Yorkshire Post”
adds, “for consideration of Sir
Oliver’s proposal that each
member of the International
Monetary Fund should con-
tribute some part of its foreign-
exchange reserves to the fund,
which should use these deposits
as the base on which inter-
national credits could be
created.
“Britain is playing her part,
and should continue to do her
utmost to increase the reserves
by her own efforts ; but there
is a strong case for their being
further fortified by the kind
of stabilisation measures which
Sir Oliver Franks has sug-
gested.”
The R.A.F.
Birthday - greetings from
London “Daily Express” :
“In 40 years the Royal Air
Force has reached maturity
without losing its youth.
“It has some of the brash-
ness that goes with young
blood. It has the cool courage
that is sometimes mistaken for
recklessness. And it has an
hour of glory which it shares
with none: the Battle of
Britain.
“At 40, the R.A.F. stands on
the brink of new and unpre-
dictable events. But it goes
forward into the future con-
fident of itself, sure of its peer-
less tradition.”


THE OTHER FELLOW'S MIND
“Joy-riding”
A sentence of two years’
imprisonment imposed by a
Victorian court on each of two
youths sounds pretty stiff
punishment for their offence
of “joy-riding”—that is, if it
were the relatively mild offence
the term denotes. Un-
fortunately, it isn’t; and who-
ever coined the phrase did a
disservice to the community.
Over the years, “joy-riding,”
applied to the unauthorised and
temporary use of a motor-
vehicle, has had the curious
effect of watering-down the
seriousness of the offence in the
public mind. It has, without
doubt, done much to soften
the public conscience on the
matter by conveying the
suggestion that, after all,
borrowing another person’s
car or motor-bike is only an
irresponsible prank; that the
borrower is in a different
category from the common
thief because he has no
intention of converting the
property to his permanent use
or profit; and that all the
owner can justifiably complain
of is that he has been put to
some inconvenience.
The result has been, until
recently, a marked reluctance
on the part of courts to treat
“joy-riding” as a serious
offence, particularly as most
offenders , are youths. Magi-
strates have imposed light
penalties and given bonds.
The ending of such leniency
is well overdue. In fact, it is
high time the term “joy-riding’’
was dropped altogether: it has
contributed to far too much
unpunished crime.— Wusslean
(Vic.).
Local Government
Not long ago the N.S.W.
Local Government Department
directed shire and municipal
councils to amend their “rating
structure” by charging to the
general fund the cost of road-
repairs and -maintenance,
street-lighting and garbage-
collection, which had previously
been met out of local town-
improvement funds which were
levied in accordance with the
needs of individual wards.
The old system worked well.
The new system looks like
working badly, judging by the
experience of the Blue
Mountains City Council.
New valuations in the Blue
Mountains area have produced
some extraordinary results.
Values in the Springwood ward
(which extends from Emu
Plains to Faulconbridge) in-
creased by more than 100 per
cent., but values in the thickly-
populated wards of South and
North Katoomba were virtually
unchanged.
The Town Clerk’s report
showed the council that a
general rate which would leave
ratepayers in the densely-
developed parts of the muni-
cipality in much the same posi-
tion as last year would yield
an additional £39,000 from
ratepayers in the Springwood
ward ; but the estimates made
no provision for spending any
extra money in that area.
Indeed, the amount set aside for
repair and maintenance of the
340 miles of dirt-roads in the
municipality was £lO,OOO less
than last year; and as most
of this mileage is in the Spring-
wood ward, it will have to bear
the bulk of the cut.
Aldermen of the Springwood
ward felt their ratepayers would
be prepared to pay even a little
more than the extra 70 per cent,
in rates they will have to meet
as a result of the increased
valuations, provided a fair
share of the additional £39,000
they will fork-out was spent
in their ward. Accordingly
they moved for a slight increase
in the general rate over the
whole municipality and named
£2o,ooo—a little more than half
their additional contribution in
rates—as a fair thing to return
to them.
But a majority of the alder-
men would have none of it.
Springwood aldermen then
offered to accept £6OOO, which
would have meant only a
decimal-point increase in the
general rate, but even this was
rejected by seven votes to six,
one alderman being absent and
the mayor declining to cast
his personal vote. The only
grain of comfort the Spring-
wood aldermen derived from
the whole unhappy incident was
the mayor’s emphatic statement
that the department’s new
“rating structure” was a wash-
out and wouldn’t work.—M. F.

travelled in obsolete trams with
the conductor collecting fares
from the footboard.
When the Melbourne branch
of the Australian Tramways
Union was formed in 1908, one
of its first moves was to have
the dangerous footboard-type
trams taken off the road. The
only service operating them was
the North Melbourne-Essendon
Company. My late father was
the shop-steward instrumental
in their being scrapped. Yet
Sydney was still running them
45 years later and, for all I
know, still is!
To compare the trams
running in Sydney in 1953 with
those in Melbourne is akin to
comparing a broken - down
T-model car with a streamlined
Fordomatic. Surely the scrap,
heap is screeching for these
torture-wagons! Kingscote

Communism in China
Communism is a phase in the
development of politically,
backward countries. Neither
the Russian aristocrats nor the
Chinese bureaucrats had pre-
pared their people for the
responsibility of self-govern-
rnent; starting from behind
scratch, probably neither nation
could have been knocked into
shape to take its place in the
modern world, except by some
group of ruthless fanatics,
A spell of Communism, or
something equally bad, may
have been the inevitable price
those peoples had to pay for
having suffered their old
tyrants so long,
However, Communism is not
static, any more than Capjtalism
is, and I think that as time goes
on the social systems in Russia
and China will deviate mare
and more—not only from the
old Leninist concepts, but from
each other. Innate racial
characteristics, which are at the
root of traditional behavior,
do not change while racial
purity is maintained; and
behavior - patterns imposed,
upon people who are by nature
antipathetic to them will be
rejected when the opportunity
occurs.
Russian Communism is not
congenial to Chinese nature. As
the Russians cannot impose
their will on China, the Chinese
will, sooner or later, branch-
out for themselves. It may be
wishful thinking, but I hope

“Try it without the hanger !”
that from the present witches’
•brew in Communist countries
something reasonable will
presently be distilled; some-
thing which will not resemble
greatly the Communism we
know.
The Western democracies
may not be prepared to accept
the new Communism what
may yet prove to have been a
step forward towards the light
for illiterate peasants would
certainly be a step back
towards the jungle for us —
but we may be able to tolerate
it in neighbor States.
If we avoid diplomatic
blunders we have a sporting
chance of coming to some state
of mutual forbearance (even
possibly of co-operaliQn and
triendship) with China before
too long.
The Chinese can be ruthless,
as we have seen, and cruel upon
occasions ; but they have not
the Russians’ spontaneous
malevolence, nor are they
completely faithless and un-
scrupulous. Also, they have
not that ingrained suspicion
and mistrust of all mankind
which especially make it hard
to come to terms with any
group of Russians. Jas.

Examinations
Last year, for the first time,
Victorian students sitting for
the School Leaving Certificate
Were denied the opportunity of
taking supplementary examina-
tions in subjects in which they
tailed. The reason for the
decision has not been made
clear.
Failure at the Leaving means,
for many students, abandon-
ment of the struggle for higher
education and the need to take
a job in which academic quali-
fications don’t count. Many
parents, especially with younger
children to support, find it
beyond their means to keep the
older ones at school for an
additional year.
Yet many scholars, facing a
major test for the first time, fail
not through lack of knowledge
but through inexperience of
examination conditions,
“nerves,” or sheer bad luck in
being confronted with one or
two “sticky” questions. The
supp lementary - examination
gave such students a second
chance to prove their worth. —

Road Toll
No matter how many patrol-
cars and -bikes we have on the
road, they are helpless to cope
with the motorist who, driving
along a country road, loses
control of his car and crashes
into a tree or pole.
The problem of the car “out
of control” is usually a
personal one. Either the speed
is too great, the driver
momentarily careless, his
judgment bad on bends, or he
dozes at the wheel at the end of
a long day’s driving.
Instead of general appeals
and warnings, a letter from the
Police Commissioner should
go to every motorist with
licence-renewals. The letter
should point-out the grave
responsibility which rests on
the holder of the licence to
maintain an accident-free
record ; and if there have been
previous accidents, to make
sure they are not repeated.
I believe such an appeal
would have a profound
influence on many people. A
slip-in pamphlet, containing
horrifying photos of actual
cases of accidents through
carelessness might also not be
andss -
We must do something to
banish the “it can t happen
to me attitude of so many
drivers. As virtually all other
approaches have been tried,
perhaps the personal one might
have some effect.—M. F. Dixon

Working Proprietors
In our society of bloated
Government staffs, dearth of
scientists, and swelling migra-
tion, what is the future for the
working proprietor, the small
businessman who desires
ownership of productive
means?
To me, his is a role worth
cultivating. No doubt there
will always be more wage-
earners than independent pro-
ducers or traders. There can
be no argument there, so long
as wage-earners, numerically,
do not change the social pat-
tern from one in which work-
ing proprietorship is normal
to one which is essentially
proletarian.
A great number of Austra-
lians employed in industry are
not working in manufacturing
industry, but in such fields as
trade, building, transport,
service-stations, entertainment,
hotels, etc. As the proportion
of the labor-force engaged in
agriculture diminishes with
advancing community wealth,
so the proportion of those
employed in manufactures
either stabilises itself or
declines, the surplus going, not
to secondary industry but to
the tertiary group.
In many of these tertiary
fields large-scale organisation
is not necessary ; they are
better suited for development
by the small proprietor.
The transition from primary
industry to tertiary activities
has been the trend in Aus-
tralia for several years, while
the proportion of secondary-
industry workers appears to
have remained static. Figures
from the Bureau of Census
and Statistics indicate this:
s' /
In 1933 primary industry
took 24 p.c. of the work-force,
secondary industry 32 p.c., and
tertiary industry 44 p.c. By


1954 primary had shrunk
to 15 p.c.; secondary
industry had risen to 36 p.c.,
and tertiary to 49 per cent.
In 1954 the Commonwealth
Census showed that of
3,700,000 workers in Australia,
660,000 were working-pro-
prietors. This is certainly not
a high proportion, when there
is room for the small unit even
in some secondary industries,
such as certain food-process-
ing plants, furniture-making,
tailoring, dressmaking, job-
printing and the production of
various building-commodities.

Pepys—and' Other Diarists
Norman Lindsay’s refreshing
discourse on “The Great Sam
Pepys” (B. 26/3/’5B), surpris-
ingly overlooked any reference
to a basic consideration —Why
was the diary written?
That Pepys never intended his
journal to be published is clear
enough—its coded nature and
extremely personal tone make
this manifest —and, to me at
least, there isn't sufficient sub-
stance in the easy explanation
that he wrote it “merely to
please himself.”
The indications are that
Pepys functioned at first on a
practical basis, to keep track
of his personal progress, but
presently found this impulse
overlaid by the discovery (sub-
conscious maybe) that the diary
had become a companion, and
the only one to whom he could
“talk” freely. Add to these
points the fact that he was a
natural journalist—“l am in all
things curious,” he noted in
1661 —and you arrive at the
conclusion that Samuel wrote
his diary simply because he
had to.
Companionship is un-
doubtedly one of the main
factors in the promoting of
personal diaries. Charles Sturt
realised this when travelling
overland from ' Sydney to
Adelaide in 1838. “In this
desert,” he wrote, “even these
pages become friends on whom
I may unbosom myself.” And,
a few years later (1844-45),
John Gilbert produced a
remarkable when journey-
ing with Leichhardt from the.
Darling Downs northward —he
began by merely making notes
on natural history, but soon
extended them into comments
on all phases of the expedition,
including the behaviour of hjs
companions, and thus up to the
time he was killed he had
“talked” to himself, during nine
months, to the extent of more
than 90,000 words.
As many would-be diarists
have learned, considerable
resolution, amounting to devo-
tion, is required to keep a
detailed journal posted day
after day, year after year.
There’s frequently a temptation
to postpone an entry, and in
most instances this causes the
job to get out of hand and the
diary to be eventually tossed
into the discard.
Pepys presents a classical
example of day-by-day devo-
tion to a personal record.
Indeed, the only time-lapse on
his part that I can recall
occurred (very excusably)
during the Great Fire, at which
period he wrote, “I fetched
away my journal-book to enter
for five days past.”
Such stickativeness is surely
impressive in the case of a man
who was always busy with
affairs of State and frequently
engrossed in the process of
making “mighty merry.” Also
most impressive is the resolu-
tion of John Gilbert, for he
was fully occupied, not only in
natural-history work but in
pushing refractory bullocks
through virgin scrub and over
rivers and ranges ; yet he con-
trived to enter-up his diary each
often to the tune of about
a thousand words.
I’m disposed to suggest,
indeed, that Gilbert’s perform-
ance was the stouter of the
two (from the physical aspect),
since he was frequently half-
starved and ragged, whereas
Pepys was always well fed and
well clothed.
Anyway, it would seem that
devotion to a diary is not
necessarily conditioned by the
state of one’s stomach, nor
by the fact that one recorder
is able to boast that he has
“left off half-skirts” and
donned a “false taby waste-
coate with gold lace,” whereas
another diarist is functioning
with the seat out of his pants.
My own enterprise in this
regard has been sustained but
somewhat narrow —I’ve main-
tained a diary for about half-
a-century, but have restricted it
almost entirely to notes on
natural history. Belatedly, I
regret my neglect of “human-
interest” material, particularly
that provided by old-timers of
the goldfields of my youth,
and maybe some of that on
offer from politicians and
certain other eminent citizens
of later days.
What of Norman Lindsay?
Has he himself, as a lifelong
devotee of Sam Pepys, also
kept a diary? If so, I hope he
isn’t going to deny his con-
temporaries a spot of pleasure
by ordering, as some discreet
gentry do, that it be kept
on ice for 50 years? Alec

Australia and the U.S.
The only thing that discus-

comparisons between the two

The difficulty is that no real

or that the percentage of

basic wage differs from one
country to another; but what
does that prove in regard to
the prosperity of either nation
as a whole?
The truth appears to be that
Australian standards differ
widely from those prevailing
in the U.S. It would be much
more to the point if, instead of
seeking to - draw over-
generalised comparisons, we
examined our economic and
social system to find-out just
why, in some respects, the U.S.
has an advantage over us.
It is widely recognised, for
example, that highly-specialised
organisation and the extensive
use of power have enabled
American manufacturers to
produce certain goods at low"
cost. One aspect that is now
receiving critical attention in
Australia is the inadequate
encouragement given by our
taxation laws to the scrapping
of obsolete plant and its
replacement by more modern
and efficient machines.
Another is the matter of
rewards for skill and know-
ledge. In Australia, the relative
advantage of the skilled worker
over the semi-skilled or un-
skilled has decreased, particu-
larly in post-war years; and
the positions of the professional
man and the highly-skilled tech-
nician are steadily worsening.
By way of contrast, the
American system rewards
brains rather than brawn. How
far this American aittitude has
been responsible for that
country’s remarkable economic
progress is difficult to deter-
mine ; but a study of this
matter may give the key to
some of our Shortcomings.
It may well be that the U.S.
could adopt, with advantage,
some features of our social-
welfare system which have
enabled even the least well-
off to -maintain themselves
above the bare bread-line. But
our concern, in Australia,
should be directed towards
remedying and correcting some
of our obvious deficiencies. —

Asiatic Migration
The latest to suggest official
abandonment of the White
Australia policy, and the
admittance of a yearly quota
of Asian migrants who would
be eligible for full citizen
rights on the same basis as
European migrants, are the
Apex Clubs.
This indicates muddled think-
ing. Quota-Entrance of Asiatics
would not solve any over-
population problems of Asian
peoples, while it would be
far more likely to arouse
hostility than the present
policy.
Sensible Asiatics realise the
reason behind the White Aus-
tralia policy. Those likely to
take offence at it are the kind
of people anxious to find some
excuse for a quarrel.
Though standards of living
and education, and social
customs differ among Euro-
peans, most of them come from
countries predominantly
Christian. Having also the
same basic culture, they are the
more easily assimilated. Any
large-scale immigration from
Asia would introduce elements
with traditions and a religious
background radically different.
Where this is the situation,
as has been proven in many
countries, two distinct peoples
will develop side by side. The
consequent social friction can
have disastrous results. —

THE MAN ON
THE LAND
"DON'T WORRY I'M SENDING IT TO
GRAZCOS."
POTASH DEFICIENCY
IF your pastures have less vigor
now than they had a few
years ago, you may be yet
another whose land is deficient
in potash. It’s quite a fashion-
able complaint, so don’t worry.
The cure may sound expensive,
but, properly applied, could
give your swards a new lease of
life.
Potash-deficiency is being
reported the breadth of the con-
tinent and in places where it
was never suspected. Why is
this so?
Up to now, superphosphate
has been the sole boost needed
for most soils under pasture-
improvement. But it looks as
though heavy stocking and
repeated cutting for hay and
silage are bringing a new need
to light. We are exhausting the
available potash - supplies in
our soils. They must be topped-
up.
On many farms the decline
from first-class pasture has been
so gradual that it has passed
unobserved. Memory plays
tricks. If a sward creases-up
suddenly from frost or an attack
Rain shelters, com-
prising a plastic film

Largely because of its
low cost this new aid

volve the loss of blood
or cause open wounds.
of red-legged earthmite, any-
one can see the change. But
potash-depletion is insidious.
That's why it is so often allowed
to continue unchecked.
What happens to the missing
element? Every time you send
a can of milk away you send
away potash. Every time you
sell a lamb or a beast you sell
part of your property. When-
ever you sell hay you make a
withdrawal from your own
“soil-bank.”
If your pasture needs potash
here are the symptoms:
G Paddocks take - on a
yellowish color ;
# Ryegrasses thin-out, grow
stunted, and deve 1 o p
yellowish tips ;
# Clovers weaken and don't
seem to grow;
G Pasture around urine- and
dung-patches grows rank ;
# Grasses and weeds are
replacing pasture that used
to thrive.
Let’s take a look at the way
the new deficiency has shown-
up in various States.
Some of the most dramatic
responses to potash-dressings
have been observed in Victoria.
Here the problem has taken
a serious turn in some of the
State’s most luxuriant farm-
lands, where it had been
thought there was no limit to
their fertility.
Potash - deficiency was
observed by the Department of
Agriculture as long ago as
1932. Yet, oddly enough, the
decline was allowed to go un-
checked. Five years ago, only
233 tons of potash were being
applied annually to pastures in
the whole of the State. And
this despite the fact that
responses, where the missing
element had been applied, were
dramatic.
One Victorian dairyfarmer
who -spotted the shortage spent
£4OO on correcting it over three
years. As a result his gross
return increased by eight times
the value of the fertiliser.
Near the South Australian
border, large tracts of problem-
country have been developed
as the result of potash-applica-
tions. These are the one-time
vacuums of “wet-heath'
country around Dartmoor—
deserts surrounded by lushness.
For years, farmers had
attempted to get pasture going
with super. All efforts failed,
even massive dressings of over
scwt. to the acre.
Trials were started, and a
response to lime was found.
Work continued and a new
response was found: 2cwt. of
potash boosted white-clover
growth more than did half-a-
ton of lime.
Now the “deserts” are turn-
ing-off fat-lambs and dairy-
products, and land-values are
soaring.
A farmer near Ballarat tried
the potash-formula and added
“I haven't got the same affection for her as
I had for Judith."
30 cows to his herd and grossed
an extra £2lOO a year—all from
an outlay of £2OO on potash.
He used three parts super, to
one of potash at first, but has
since switched to a 50-50
mixture, which he finds more
economical.
In South Australia it has
been reported that potash could
double pasture - yields on
80,000 acres in the State’s pro
gressive south-east.
Areas affected are chiefly
around Mingbool, Glencoe,
Caroline and Lucindale. Both
virgin soils and land which has
been farmed for a long time
are affected. In new country
two types of tree often give
a clue to the deficiency:
stringy-bark and manna-gums.
Older areas such as Glencoe
and Mingbool suffer today from
the depletions of yesterday.
Potash has been lost through
constant cropping with cereal
and potatoes.
A field-officer with the S.A.
Department of Agriculture,
P. L. Marrett, recently estimated
that on 80,000 acres of sub.-
clover growth would increase
fourfold by top-dressing with
lcwt. or 2cwt. of potash an acre.
To offset the fears of those
who complain that potash costs
£37 a ton he has recommended
the following procedure:
Assuming 200 acres need
treating, cover a third every
year with lcwt. of potash.
Give the other two-thirds half
a bag of super. The total cost
of a three-year programme
would be £620.
A yearly dressing of a bag
of super, to the acre would
cost £750 over the same period
—and results would not be as
good.
in Western Australia potash-
responses have been dramatic,
too. One dairyfarmer spread
potash on half his farm and
his herd rewarded him with
a third more milk.
The land, which is in the
Busseltoq district, has been
under pasture for 35 years.
Sub.-clover growth had become
patchy. In the experiment the
farm was divided in two by a
cattle-race. The first year,
potash went on half the farm at
2cwt. to the acre. After that,

the rate on the same half was
cut to 311 b. except on paddocks

acre was given.
On treated country, sub.-
clover has now. thickened-up
and is growing vigorously—in
strong contrast to paddocks on
the untreated part.
The herd spends a week on
treated land, then moves over
to untreated land. Detailed
records are kept.
How do you remedy a
potash shortage?
You apply either muriate-of-
potash or sulphate-of-potash.
It can be spread either alone
or with superphosphate.
How much to apply depends
on how bad is the deficiency.
If this is severe, up to 2cwt.
an acre may be needed as the
first application. This will cost
around £2 an acre—costly, but
well justified, as returns will
prove.
If depletion is less severe,
lcwt. an acre may be enough.
In any case, follow-up dress-
ings are a “must.” These are
recommended as a quarter to
half-a-cwt. an acre on pasture
that has been grazed, and lcwt.
in the autumn following a hay-
crop.
Research has shown that a
good hay-crop can mean that
you bale lcwt, of potash from
every acre cut. Unless you
rigidly feed back to the same
paddock, soil-reserves of potash
go down by that amount.
How do you conduct a trial?
You can, of course, chuck-
out some potash on any old
. paddock and see whether the
pasture grows better where it
falls. But this won’t tell you
how much better or how much
fertiliser to apply. And with
an expensive product like
potash you can soon waste
large sums of money.
Better to conduct your trials
in a workmanlike way to tetl
you how much to apply.
First choose a uniform, level
paddock which is typical of
the average soil of your
property. Keep clear of damp
spots, old stump-holes and
rabbit-warrens. Don’t run
your trial where stock have
camped in the comer of a
paddock or near trees.
Fence-off part of the paddock
and mark-out strips which are
to receive, different treatment.
One of these must be left un-
treated and is called “the
control.”
Apply potash at different
rates on each strip. Rates
could be a quarter-cwt., half-
cwt. and 2cwt. to the acre.
Use an accurate drill or
direct-drop spreader. Spinner-
type broadcasters are not ideal
fbr potash, even on normal
paddock work.
Two or three drill-widths are
enough for each strip.
Mark the corners of strips
with Strong stakes and keep a
record of applications, drawing-
up a plan for reference.
Keep stock clear of the area.
If you decide to cut it, then
do so evenly on all plots. To
determine the yield per acre
for comparison between strips,
cut a square-yard from each
strip and collect the clippings
separately. Weigh them and
multiply by the number of
square-yards in an acre (4840).
If you want to test other
fertilisers or trace-elements,
run cross-strips at right-angles
to the first ones. These will
give you any desired combina-
tion.
Finally, guard against form-
ing any opinions which might
be influenced by beliefs you
held before the trial. Call-in
a neighbor if possible, and
draw on his judgment before
showing him the plan.

REPORT FROM CROHAMHURST
(10/4/'58)
Light rain only over most of Queensland during May,
although moderate rain should occur on the, north coast.
General rains are indicated in the whole of the State during
June, and these should relieve the existing dry conditions in
the south-west.
Rainfall will probably be light and patchy over a large
part of N.S.W. during May, apart from moderate rains on
the southern tablelands, south-west slopes and Riverina.
General rains likely during June, and these may be
associated with gales in inland areas cyclonic activity
on the coast.
Victoria should receive good general rains in May, with
the heaviest falls in the east central, west coast and upper
north-east areas. Fairly heavy rains and flooding are likely
during June and July.
Good rains should occur in the agricultural areas of
South Australia during May, with the heaviest falls in the
Stirling Ranges and in the south-east. Rainfall probably
light in the interior, although good general rains are
indicated over the whole of the State during June.
Moderate to good rains should occur in the south-west
agricultural areas of Western Australia during May, with
the best rains on the central and south coast and s.-w.
central south. The Kimberleys should get reasonably good
rains; poor elsewhere.

NEXT MONTH IT WILL BE
"All aboard for
The Sydney Sales!"
At Haddon Rig
52 years ago, when Haddon Rig sent its first
record-breaking team to Sydney, the rams
had to travel 20 miles over dusty roads to
the rail. Then motor transport and later
aircraft changed this picture; since 1946,
each team has been flown direct from the
property to Sydney.
Although Haddon Rig has led the way in
many other directions, it is the unswerving
observance of two traditional principles—
consistent mating of “like with like” and
the retention of the outstanding rams every
year—that enables the Stud to offer high-
class rams in substantial numbers year after
year. These rigid principles enable each
season’s progeny to inherit the remarkable
uniformity that is the hallmark of Haddon
Rig Blood.
Haddon Rig Rams offer you all the qualities
gained by 76 years of skilled breeding—mas-
sive frames, dense, soft-handling wool, high
lambing percentages, together with ability to
transmit these invaluable characteristics.
At the 1957 Sydney Ram Sales, bidders con-
ferred triple honours on the Stud. Haddon
Rig sold the top Merino Ram for £4,725, 5
“Specials” for £14,490, and 110 rams for
£47,806 top aggregate for the 18th
successive year.
As Haddon Rig is sending down another
particularly strong team for the June Sales,
breeders and growers will again be able to
place their own value on Haddon Rig Blood.

Women’s Letters
SYDNEY
It was a gay and happy opening-night
for the New York City Ballet at the
Empire, though few women chose to
dress-up in anything spectacular. The
cocktail-frock and the waltz-length
evening-dress have now become de
rigueur for the theatre, and they can be
really pretty. Among the long dresses
worn, Mrs. David Klippel s white-
organdie sheath with its wide tucks from
hemline to bodice was outstanding.
Everyone seemed to find the ballet
exciting. The dances were so different
from those we have been seeing, and
the colors in “Fanfare” (where, the
dancers .all represent different instru-
ments of the orchestra) and in ‘ Western
Symphony” were skilful and subtle. It
was interesting to hear that this New
York Ballet is not particularly rich. Its
leading male-dancer, Andre Eglevsky,
contrasting the money it spends with
that spent by the Bolshoi Ballet, said:
“We dance ‘Serenade’ in Grecian tunics.
The Russians rehearse in Grecian tunics.
Nonetheless, the dressing of the ballets
seen last week was very beautiful, fresh
and brilliantly designed,

Notable at the preview party for the
Royal Art Society’s autumn exhibition
at Anthony Hordern’s Gallery were the
little red dots decorating such a large
number of the exhibits. Mr. and Mrs.
Bruce McFarlan bought paintings by
Norman Lindsay and Erik Langker.
Miss Hope Kellow chose “Street Scene”
by Elsie Dangerfield, and Mrs. Herman
Slade bought Alan Hansen’s King’s
Cross study. Mrs. McFarlan, who
spoke the opening words for the exhibi-
tion the following afternoon, was wear-
ing a sack-line dress in black. Mr. and
Mrs. Sam Drury were at this party, Mrs.
Drury fresh from arrangement-making
for marriage of daughter Adele, in May.
Adele will marry John Cunningham, of
Chatswood, at the Church of St. Mary
Magdalen, Rose Bay, and the reception
will be held at the Rose Bay home of her
parents.

Guest-of-honor at the At Home of the
Royal Empire Society’s Women’s Auxi-
liary was Mrs. C. D. Candy, wife of Air-
Vice-Marshal Douglas Candy. An orchid
grown by Dr. Garnet Halloran was
presented to Mrs. Candy by Mrs. Hal-
loran, who with Mrs. W. J. Dakin
hostessed for the occasion. The guest-
speaker, Colonel Prentice, was intro-
duced by Lady Berryman and gave a
talk on his recent travels abroad. Colonel
Prentice said that in 100 days he visited
18 countries, saw 32 cities, and spoke
with 100 of the world’s leading states-
men. He said that of all those whom he
met five seemed to be outstanding. They
were Winston Churchill, Dr. Adenauer,
the Pope, General Chiang Kai-shek and
Dr. Syngman Rhee.
Anne Walsh flew up from Canberra
to make her debut at the Monte Sant'
Angelo ex-students’ dance held at the
Empress Ballroom during the week.
Italian Consul-General Dr. L. Sebasti-
ani, and Mrs. Sebastiani received the
debs., who were presented by the matron-
of-honor, Mrs. Roma O’Reilly. The
president of the ball-committee, Mary
Leonard, was escorted by Geoffrey Hew-
lett; the secretary, Joan Lock, by Clem
Hogarth. Vice-presidents Mrs. John
Dowd and Mrs. Michael Fitzpatrick,
Therese Storman and Rosamund White
were among those who entertained
parties. Anne Walsh’s photograph is by
Norton Trevaire.
The annual cocktail-party and buffet-
dinner of the Sydney Stock Exchange
Club, held, as is the custom, at the Yacht
Squadron, Kirribilli, was enjoyed by
guests no less than by members and their
wives. Not every woman present could
understand the natter about investment
affairs that sometimes cropped-up, but
all appreciated the problem of driving to
the Yacht Squadron under the new
traffic rules and sandbags that surround
the northern approaches to the Harbor
Bridge. There are just about 100 members
of Sydney Stock Exchange, and to
mention one without mentioning all might
be considered a breach of the rules ; but
jointly and severally stockbrokers are
obviously very hospitable people. The
Beresford O’Conors welcomed the guests
on behklf of the club.

“Sally” will probably be the name
of the baby girl on whose birth Dr. and
Mrs. Tom Bateman are receiving con.
gratulations. This new babe brings the
Bateman family up to seven—four girls
and three boys.

Because of all the talk about
gambling during the week, this short
cautionary tale (true) may be appro,
priate. A man and his wife decided they
would have a night-out: dinner at the
club, followed by a show. Having
settled themselves in the club-lounge, they
had a long wait for cocktails, and
started putting sixpences into the poker*
machines. After a while the husband
said he-would get the drinks from the
bar, but there he was attracted by the
2s. machines. Before long he had spent
everything in his pockets, including the
price of the cocktails. He returned,
shamefaced, to ask his wife to finance
the evening’s entertainment, only to find
that by then she too was penniless. They
went home hungry and show-less, theil
season railway-tickets providing trans*
port, and (would you believe it?) they
haven’t touched a poker-machine sinceii

Far-ahead date for the Black and
White Ball in aid of the Royal Blind
Society is October 7 at the Trocadero.
While the president, Mrs. Marcel Deky*
vere, is overseas Mrs. Neville Mantling
will be acting-president, and already
there is over £5OOO in the kitty, which
augurs well for the ultimate success of
the ball. The money now in hand is
the result of the gala-opening night of
the “Cherry Blossom Show” and the
sale of a Shorthorn bull which Mr. and
Mrs. Roy McCaughey donated.

There has not been much sign of the
really short skirt in Sydney circles yet.
Many people are wearing the sack, the
chemise, the shift and so on, and many
more “the relaxed line.” But the length
still seems to be about 14 inches front
the ground, which, we are told, is quite
the wrong thing. We should be shorten-
ing skirts two to three inches above that#

The news, or rumor, that Princess
Margaret has taken a wardrobe of really
short dresses to the West Indies for her
tour may turn the tables in favor of the
sixteen-inches-from-the-ground look, tot
the Princess, to judge from her Latest
photograph, has become.really smart ana
fashionable-looking. The chief' change
seems to be in her “chrysanthemum
haircut/which gives her the completely
modern look, and indicates the likeli-
hood of her becoming a true leader o£
fashion.

Noted that a pretty new fashion ifl
America gives brides and bridesmaids
small baskets instead of bouquets to
carry. Varying shades of green with
white are used, and miniature ivy over-
flows from baskets of mignonette, white
bouvardia and white roses. For the
bride a chartreuse orchid can be tied with
white ribbon to the handles and wont
later as a going-away corsage.


MELBOURNE
To celebrate the centenary of Mel-
bourne Church of England Grammar
School, a reception was given at the Town
Hall by the Lord Mayor (Cr. F. W.
Thomas) —who is himself an “old boy”
of Grammar —and his wife. Yellow
chrysanthemums and orange dahlias were
set on the dais. The official party
included Sir Edmund Herring (also an
old Melburnian), and Lady Herring, presi-
dent of the school council ; Archbishop
Frank Woods and Mrs. Woods ; External
Affairs Minister R. G. Casey (who also
was educated at Grammar), and the
school’s headmaster (Mr. B. Hone), and
Mrs. Hone. The captain of the school,
Peter Van de Velde, on behalf of the
school presented the Lord Mayor with
an illuminated address.
Among those who were also at the
reception were Mr. Justice Sholl, and the
Bishop of Geelong, the Rt. Rev. D.
McKie (both old Melburnians); presi-
dent of the Old Melburnians (Mr. Ralph
Hunt) and Mrs. Hunt; the Dean of
Melbourne, Dr. S. Barton Babbage, and
Mrs. Babbage ; Prof. C. E. Moorhouse,
Sir Robert and Lady Knox, Mr. and
Mrs. J. M. Relph, Cr. and Mrs. Tony
Luxton, Cr. Sir Harold Gengoult Smith,
Mr. and Mrs. Ross Grey Smith and
Mrs. Douglas Cox.

At the Public Schools’ Club Ball at
St. Kilda Palais a full-size racing-four,
with model figures of rowers, was a
highlight of the decorations. The models
were dressed in Melbourne Grammar
sweaters to honor the school’s centenary ;
and, of course, Grammar wdn the Head
of the River at Geelong. Adorning the
walls of the ballroom were the colors
and crests of the 11 public schools now
belonging to the club: Melbourne
Grammar, Wesley, Scotch College,
Xavier, Geelong Grammar, Geelong
College, and the recently joined Hailey-
bury College, Carey Grammar, Caulfield
Grammar, St. 'Kevin’s and Brighton
Grammar.
The official party was received by
president Pat Kearney, and Mrs. Kearney,
assisted by vice-president E. C. H, Taylor
and Mrs. Taylor. Mrs. Kearney chose
a bouffant gown of grey nylon and lace.
Her daughter Sue, who had entertained
30 friends at a dinner-party at her
parents’ Brighton home before the ball,
chose an Empire-gown of deep-Parma-
violet taffeta.

The marriage of Ann Jocelyn Shelton
and Brian James Gerraty was celebrated
with Nuptial Mass at Xavier College
Chapel. Ann, who is the eldest daughter
°f Dr. and Mrs. J. N. Shelton, of Maid-
stone, wore a gown of white Swiss
organdie which had graduating tucks
from the Empire-bodice to the hemline,
with the skirt falling into a graceful train.
Her short tulle veil was caught with a
coronet of stiffened tulle, and she carried
a bouquet of gardenias and lily-of-the-
valley. Her attendants, Rosemary Bacn-
Zl ger and sisters Joan and Maroa Shelton,
wore princess-line frocks of white cotton-
shantung which had Empire-bodices
finished with a flat bow. On their heads
were coronets of field-flowers, and they
carried matching posies. The bride-
groom, the elder son of Mr. and Mrs.
H. F. Gerraty, of Sandringham, had
Norman Clauscen as best man. Grooms-
men were Alan Gerraty and Brian
McCann.
After the ceremony guests were
received at a buffet-luncheon at Glen-
dower, Queen’s Road, Mrs. Shelton wear-
ing a sheath-frock in teal-blue tonings
with a small dusty-pink toque, and Mrs.
Gerraty a grey-and-white-flecked tweed
frock and matching jacket and a platter
hat trimmed with grey petals. After a
few weeks in Sydney, Brian will take his
bride to England, where he will do a
post-graduate course in dentistry.
Having long occupied a prominent
place in public life, it was not surprising
that Mrs. David Ely, of Moonee Ponds,
should have been made a Justice of the
Peace. During the war Mrs. Ely worked
as hon. secretary of the Comforts Fund,
and was also one of the organisers of the
Food for Britain Appeal. She is now
hon. secretary of the Mayoress of Essen-
don’s Aid-for-Others Group. An expert
on child-psychology, she has given broad-
cast talks on the subject.
The Nurses Memorial Centre, St.
Kilda Rd., was the setting for a' large
afternoon-party at which the guest-of-
honor was Mrs. Ernesto Del Castillo, wife
of the Armed Forces Attache for the
Philippines. Mrs. Del Castillo, who gave
a talk on life in her country, was
presented with a sheath of flowers tied
with the national colors of the Philip-
pines: red, white and blue. This party
was the first of a series of social-educa-
tional functions to be arranged this year
by the women’s group of the Australia-
Asian Association of Victoria. The
programme is designed to bring together
women of this country and Asia to
discuss common problems and aims. The
guest-of-honor, who gained her medical
degree from Santo Dornas University
is the mother of five children.
The 90 guests present were received by
the president of the women’s group, Mrs.
R. T. Breen, assisted by vice-presidents
Lady Selleck and Mrs. John Chaldjian.
Guests included Lady Lowe, Mrs. K. Y.
Leung (wife of the Consul for China),
Mrs. M. Nomoto (the Japanese Consul’s
wife), Mrs. H. I. Fader (her husband is
Consular representative for Thailand),
Mrs. P. Hosking, Mrs. J. B. Jackson,
Mrs. V. Blogg, Mrs. G. C. Molyneux
and Mrs.-John Shaw.

Although the trees in St. Kilda Road
still wear their autumn raiment, the
designs for the coming spring fashions
may be seen ; but more appropriate for
the immediate season was the manne-
quin-parade sponsored by the Fur Trade
Association and held at Menzies’. Among
many glamorous items were a cardigan-
coat in white Indian-lamb; a slender
grey squirrel coat which had a folded
cape-collar; a Russian-ermine coat
shaped to the trapeze-line; a black
Persian-lamb blazer with a detachable
white Arctic-fox collar; a lovely full-
length chemise-coat in Russian broad-
tail, bound in black braid. For the
young and gay there were white Aus-
tralian sheepskin frontier-pants; a
scarlet three-quarter travel-coat with a
detachable hood in sheepskin, and (for a
man) a rugged shooting-jacket in kan-
garoo-skin.

In a showing at the Hotel Australia,
jerseys and kashas from the Wendouree
Mills appeared in an entrancing array of
colors, made-up into smart, simple
frocks, blouses and slacks by Maurice
Dowd Associates. They were moderately
priced and very wearable. The same
afternoon at the same venue, new
materials and contemporary designs were
displayed by the White Manufacturing
Co., well-known for their Adelyn range.
Mother-and-daughter fashions were a
feature of the parade. In the range for
the younger woman there were elegant
but casual chemise- and sheath-frocks.
A new rayon which will be seen next
season is Tanshung, a printed silklike
material with an Oriental look. It does
not shrink or crease. Three other rayons
introduced by Adelyn were Lavenelle
(a cool, silky anti-shrink, crease-resisting
Grafton material), Minglora (a novelty-
weave non-iron with a cotton appear-
ance), and Grafaine (a material with a
drip-dry finish), which is ideal for the
hot weather. Cotton-satin, in a par-
manent-sheen finish, figures largely in
the Adelyn range., This is a special-
occasion cotton that has a soft drape and
a smooth silklike touch, excellent for
summer-night frocks. Accent in this
collection is mainly on multi-colors, but
black, white and many blues were shown.
Patterns were gay and striking, featur-
ing geometrical and contemporary motifs
for the younger woman, and fresher
florals for the matron.


PRESENCES
By H. M. GREEN
IT was a strained tendon
that had brought the
young fellow to the sur-
gery ; he had been
wandering beyond the
regular pathways and slipped
on a wet rock. He seemed
lorely,- and interesting, with
his thin pale face and the with-
drawn expression in his queer
dark eyes.
Part of the attraction about
this young fellow had been
his silence. At first, that is,
for after a while, finding the
doctor sympathetic and a good
listener, he became talkative.
It appeared that his parents
were dead and that his only
brother had been killed in
New Guinea; he had served
there himself. It also appeared,
a little later, that there was a
girl in Sydney, but something
seemed to have gone wrong
about that.
His landlady was a garrulous
nuisance; he was fed-up, he
said, with dodging her
daughter, and he had met
nobody that he cared to know.
Reading gave him headaches,
but he could still paint a little;
he had been earning his living
by commercial art, between
university and the war. They’d
keep his job for him, or said
they would ; all he had to do
was to take things easy and
get a better hold on his nerves;
he had enough to keep him for
a while and it all seemed simple
enough! So he spent most of
his time hanging round with a
sketch-book, trying for rock-
and-mist effects. Not so
boring as one might imagine ;
rather fascinating, really. “As
a matter of fact ...”
“Ah,” the doctor murmured,
encouragingly. “Have a cigar.
Queer things, these mists.”
“Yes,” said the boy eagerly.
“Curious shapes they take,
sometimes. Suggestive, rather.”
The doctor agreed, and gave
him a light.
They talked for a while
about mountain - views and
what the artist made of them.
“They seem to have no
imagination,” the boy said.
“Or else they cork it up and
never set down anything they
couldn’t depose to in a court
of law.”
The doctor had him to
dinner, and after a day or two
made some excuse to look him
up. When the knee was well
again they got into the habit
of wandering round the cliffs
after consultation-hours as well
as at weekends—it wasn’t a
very absorbing practice—and
became quite intimate. But the
boy seemed preoccupied, as
though he had something on
his mind that he wanted and
didn’t want to talk about.
Irritable too ; he was evidently
under some sort of strain:
but the doctor was willing to
put up with some brusqueness,
in the circumstances.
“I agree,” he said, on one
of their walks, returning to a
favorite topic, “that a painter
ought to use his imagination ;
he isn’t a photographer. But
there has to be a limit to that
sort of thing. You’ve got to
keep your feet on the ground.”
“You don’t paint with your
feet,” the boy exclaimed
impatiently. “I’m not suggest-
ing that he ought to invent
anything. Or distort it either;
I’m no ultra-modernist. But
suppose he sees, or \ thinks he
sees, something he can’t abso-
lutely nail down; something
that won’t wait for
him, so to speak. If
he’s sure it is some-
thing, isn’t that
enough? Is the world
all black-and-white,
with no intervening
shades?”
“You don’t go
in for monochrome,”
said the doctor, fatu-
ously provocative.
“Don’t be silly,”
said the boy, rising to
the bait. “If I were
to tell you . . . Sorry.
I’m a bit cranky, I
know, and the whole
thing’s so incredible.”
A WEEK later they
were sitting on the
edge of a cliff that fell
straight down for a
thousand feet, so that
the treetops in the
valley beneath looked
like moss. The boy,
nerves and all—but
then he had been an
airman dangling his
legs over the edge ; the
doctor preferred to lie
flat, chin on a forearm.
Opposite them, half-a-
mile-away, a mountain
thrust a dark-blue shoulder
into the low clouds ; it was at
this that they were gazing.
“That’s where I see him,
mostly,” the boy murmured,
as though to himself. “There’s
nothing now though. There
never is, when I look for it.”
Then he seemed to realise what
he had said, and looked round
almost defiantly.
“The mind often works like
that,” said the doctor, deter-
mined not to show any sign of
surprise. “I have puzzled a
whole evening over a medical
problem, and then, next morn-
ing”—
“Yes, I know all about that.
But this isn’t a case of working
anything out subconsciously.
It’s . . . it’s something that’s
definitely there, though one
can’t always see it.”
He paused, and then some
inhibition broke like a dam in
a flood. “The first time,” he
said, “I wasn’t trying after
anything in particular; day-
dreaming, I suppose, with a
pencil in my hand ; in a way,
perhaps, just waiting, and
absorbing.”
“The proper receptive atti-
tude,” said the doctor. “So
they say. But I know very
little about that sort of thing.”
“Well, after a while the mist
began to stir slightly; you
know how it does sometimes.
Only this* time there seemed
to be a suggestion, and then
more than a suggestion, of
shape about it: not an ordinary
amorphous cloud-shape; a
human outline, but gigantie<
Just a bare arm it was, but
whatever the arm belonged to
must have been nearly as big
as the mountain. That was all
I could see just then ; the shape
faded again almost as I made
it out, so that I could scarcely
be sure of anything.”
The doctor raised himself a
little, cautiously, on his elbows,
and examined what he could
see of the boy’s face, but the
eyes were hidden.
“After that I got to see more,
now and then. But I couldn’t
tell when there’d be anything;
and what I did see was only
in dissolving glimpses. In the
intervals I thought it must be
all imagination, the artist’s
imagination, if you like, or per-
haps something wrong with my
eyes. And then J’d get another
glimpse, and be quite sure, and,
once more nothing for a while,
and be uncertain again. But
I seemed to have a
impression, pretty strong
occasionally, that I must go
ahead, and see more, and try to
understand; that there was
something of immense impor-
tance hanging to it all. It
was most tantalising, infuriat-
ing even. But by and by there
was a great deal more. You
know the lines
Millions of spiritual creatures
walk the earth
Unseen, both when we wake t
and when we sleep?
“Particularly when we
sleep,” said the 'doctor, for-
getting himself for a moment.
“And just as I Was taking-off a very
laughable thing happened."

“Yes, we had to read Words-
worth at school.”
“Nonsense, it’s Milton. You
mean I’ve been dreaming?
Well, I haven’t.” And then,
still staring at that great blue
shoulder with its cloudy
summit, “Look! Can you see
anything over there now?”
“Nothing whatever,” the
doctor replied, automatically,
“except mountain and cloud.”
And then, rubbing his eyes,
“Nothing ... at least . . . no,
nothing.”
“Well, it got so that it wasn’t
only over there, or only one of
them. I’ve seen them in lots of
places.”
“But what exactly have you
seen? What are they?”
“How can I tell? They have
the shape of men, and women,
all gigantic. The one that
-usually sits upon that moun-
tain : his feet reach right
down into the valley beneath.
But it isn’t only their stature
that’s gigantic. There’s some-
thing about them —not terri-
fying ; they don’t mean any
harm to us, I’m certain of that
•—but . . . awe-inspiring. As
a rule they seem to be uncon-
scious of us, or at least to
pay no attention to us, though
one can’t always be sure of
that. But sometimes it’s quite
different; as if they had us,
the whole world of us, under
the microscope.”
“The gods become visible
and dwelling amongst us?” the
doctor ventured.
“Not at all. They’re not
gods. Demi-gods possibly, and
yet . . . They have power,
of course ; one gets an impres-
sion of colossal power, and
colossal knowledge. But
they’re not all-powerful, or all-
knowing either; you can see
that from the expression in
their faces. The one I have
spoken of before: I have seen
him sifting on that mountain-
top, chin on elbows, elbows
on his knees, in a profound
and brooding melancholy, the
universe almost as enigmatic
to him as it is to us.”
“Like Rodin’s Penseur?” '
“Not in the least like the
Penseur. This is no primi-
tive, whatever else it is.”
“Well, what is he?”
“I don’t know for certain,
and it’s not so easy to explain
the little that I do know”
He raised an arm suddenly, and
pointed: “Look ; quick! Do
you see now?”
'T'HE doctor shaded his eyes
with his hand, and stared
harder than ever at that cloudy
shoulder of mountain.
“Why the devil did I forget
my distance spectacles?” he
muttered to himself. He
rubbed his eyes again and mur-
mured something about hallu-
cinations. -
The boy paused a while.
“These Presences,” he said,
“are apparenty, as we are,
earth-born beings, but they are
not earth-bound. They may be
mortal; I should imagine they
were; but I’m pretty sure that
time means comparatively little
to them, or space either. Still,
they seem to be after all finite.
Their desires are infinite ; their
powers, however great, are
finite. This fact obsesses them;
they are always pondering
over it, trying to find some way
of escaping from it. They are
as much less than gods as they
are more than men.”
“Allied with this, there is
some more positive tragedy,
some more immediate disaster
that seems to them almost
inevitable. Age by age they see
it coming nearer, all the more
terrible because of some
infinitesimal hope or possi-
bility of escape that they have
never yet been able to realise.
“All this out of nervous
strain and a few driftings in
the mist: that’s what any sen-
sible person would say, no
doubt. And yet, why shouldn’t
Milton be right? Why should
life, even earthly life, be con-
fined to beings of flesh and
blood, carbon and water and
lime? As we began with a
drop of protoplasm, might not
another sort of being have
begun with something less
material, less limited, and so
proceeded so much further?”
“But what’s their object in
appearing to you, at any rate?”
“Well, I’m pretty sure that
they have something for us,
some advice or warning, and
for that reason they are willing
to allow and even encourage
some sort of approach to them,
by a mind that happens to be
to a certain extent in tune. I
fancy they can see among us
also the beginnings of some
terrible disaster, and that they
want to help us, partly out of
pity and partly as a relief from
brooding over the infinitely
greater disaster that they see
ahead of themselves. Besides,
there may be more in it than
that: they may be sympathetic
because they regard our
tragedy as in its small way
parallel with or symbolic of
their own.”
To the doctor all this had
taken on something of the
quality of a dream: real, even
convincing, in its way and for
the time, as dreams are, but
carrying with it a half-aware-
ness, often present in such
dreams, that reality belongs to
a different, a waking world.
Yet there were some personal
reasons, though not entirely
convincing ones, why he could
not be absolutely certain that
it was altogether a dream.
“Well,” he said, “have you
learned anything else about
them?”
“I have seen a woman of
these Presences stretched full-
length along that range there
more beautiful than anything
one could imagine ; lying with
her head upon one arm and
the other dropped far down
the mountainside, her fingers
dabbling in the waterfall;
watching, with the air of sad
preoccupation that they usually
wear, a party of picnickers
with their scrabble of news-
papers and castaway crusts
and jamtins, a child screech-
ing and a woman and her hus-
band arguing about something
that had been left behind;
more or less, except for the
emotional reaction, as a biolo-
gist might watch white-ants in
rotten wood. And when I saw
how the sadness became pity
and the pity horror, she
turned her head away and a
moment later she had risen
and was walking off across the
mountain-tops, and then up-
ward, over them, till she dis-
appeared among the clouds.
“I have watched the begin-
nings of incredible journeys
out and away from this world.
It is as though some invisible
bridge opened out in front of
them. No\fr and then I have
thought I caught a glimpse of
such a bridge, a faint glimmer-
ing of opalescence; but I
could never be certain.”
He was silent again, and
then he burst out: “These
Presences draw me to them.
They absorb me. I’ve tried to
draw some of them, but it’s
no good. I can’t paint; I’ve
burnt everything I’ve done;
I can’t eat; I can’t sleep . . .”
His voice had grown shrill.
Under control again, he raised
his head and his tone became
matter-of-fact. “But I agree
that one must have evidence
that can satisfy the reason as
well as the imagination. When
I have got that, we shall see.”
“Evidence? But how on
earth?”
' The boy seemed not to hear
him. “It will be taking a cer-
tain risk,” he said ruminatively.
“It’s a question of confidence,
of belief. If I follow out over
that bridge . . .”
'T'HE doctor had met the
boy’s lawyer at the rail-
way-station.
“That’s about all I can tell
you,” said the doctor. “I
didn’t see him for a couple of
days; had to go up to
Katoomba for a consultation,
and there was an operation
after that. When I came back
there was a note from him,
dated the day before, saying
he was going but after the
evidence he had mentioned.
I called, but they didn’t know
where he was. Next day they
found him. A couple of hikers
had been walking along the
foot of the cliff at which we
had been looking that time. He
was smashed flat; had evi-
dently fallen from the top.”
The lawyer tapped his pipe
on the fender, leaned back in
his easy-chair and stretched
himself vigorously. “The
question,” he said, “since—
correct me if I am wrong —
there was no reason why any-
one should have been likely to
attack him . . . the question is,
whether he fell, or whether he
jumped over.”
“They found where he had
been standing, but the only
marks were his own footprints.
They led straight to the edge
of the cliff.”
“I see. Must have been
suicide, then.”
“Urn,” said the doctor. “So
the coroner thought.”
The lawyer looked at him
questioningly.
“That cliff drops sheer.
Nothing to deflect the passage
of the body outward. But the
spot where it was found is a
good fifty feet out from the
base of the cliff. Ground flat
and rocky ; the body couldn’t
have rolled, and it was clear
that the hikers hadn’t touched
it. What do you make of
that?”
The lawyer stared at him,
puzzled. “What do you make
of it?” he asked.
“Nothing,” said the doctor.
“I have my living to earn.”


his own territory, is so well maintained
that the book has to be read at a
sitting.
But what makes the book different is
the sketches interpolated of the lives
of the men on the patrol. Young Pak,
for instance, has been rescued from a
Korean home in which his old father
and sister were brutally slaughtered by
his fellow-townsmen because the father
refused to join in. action against
invaders. Hsiung had joined the
Chinese Communist army to save him-
self from the fate of his rich Chinese
family, denounced and butchered by
their own townsfolk inflamed by the
new Communist agitators; he had
served only until he could desert, and
was now enlisted to fight in vengeance
against the Communist anny.
The instructor-interpreter, Lim, had
withstood horrible Japanese tortures;
trying to protect his wayward charges
after a brothel-brawl in Seoul, Lim is
arrested and brutally beaten by the
Seoul police, his own side, and nothing
to be done about it because of the
delicate international situation. Finally,
the Tall Man himself, amazed at the
discipline and toughness of the Chinese
Communist soldiers, wonders why, on
being released from p.0.w.-camps
they threw off every stitch of good
American-issue clothing, even to
walking naked back to their own side.
In Korea, Harris presents a country
absolutely divided, race against race,
friend against friend, son against
family, and man against himself. His
battle is different from Hungerford’s
New Guinea campaign, in that the main
characters, the natives, fight without
hope of future advantage. This dark
desert of the soul, lighted by only
courage, he presents forcefully and
with considerable ingenuity, without
endeavoring to account for it; his
utmost in this direction being the hope
of his Australian patrol-leader, that it
may never happen in Australia.
New Beerbohm Essays
Max Beerbohm’s collected broad-
casts, published with a few recent essays
and sketches and the 1943 Rede lecture
on Lytton Strachey, Mainly on the Air
(Heinemann), made a curious impact
upon a reviewer fresh from inspecting
a young relative’s English course at the
Sydney University of Technology: “The
Grapes of Wrath,".“Brave New World,”
and “1984.”
Beerbohm might be more truly said
to have survived into than to have lived
in the new world of Huxley’s satire ;
he would certainly have been vaporised
in Orwell’s horrible Communist utopia,
while there is something impossibly
comic, something surrealistically incon-
gruous, in imagining Beerbohm, top-
hatted or straw-hatted, in the jalopy
taking Steinbeck’s farm-family from
Oklahoma to California in search of
food and work. If his forte, as
Guedalla said, was the repression of
enthusiasms, he had also the Edwardian
Englishman’s ability to ignore what he
did not want to see: he was one for
whom, even in his own times, the
workaday world of Shaw and Wells did
not exist.
No student of literary contributions
to progress will get extra marks for
studying Beerbohm; he failed to
sorrow over the poor, and on the other
hand he achieved no anguish over the
frightening utopias which too much
zeal might bring about. The object, or
at any rate the result, of his literary
efforts was to perfect a portrait of him-
self, much as a clown might, over the
years, refine and refine on the details of
the same dress and patter—and it is not
surprising that the two best pieces in
this present collection should be the
portrait in words of George Moore and
the lecture in defence of Lytton
Strachey, somewhat similar prac-
titioners.
But in thinking of these authors as
clowns, which indeed they were, one
must remember Beerbohm was a
clown who always Insisted that no one
not thoroughly grounded in Latin could
write English, and that Beerbohm
recognised in Moore his “matchless
honesty of mind . . . and his loving
reverence of all that in the arts was
nobly done,” and in Strachey “atj
Ironist of an order far superior t<?
mine” and “a perfect master of Englisn
prose.” They were exquisite clowns, af
once a tribute to a bad old world in
which clowning could function at so
high a level and a criticism of a brave
new world which is most unlikely to
produce their equal.
There is much in these essays: on
music-halls, old London, playgoing,
Maxine Elliot’s comedian - husband,
first meetings with Yeats,, old Hethway
the imaginary friend of Morris, and
Dodworth the imaginary political
journalist, to show Beerbohm as the
brilliant literary entertainer; and that
he was conscious of himself as a public
figure is to be found in the essay
“From Bloomsbury to Bayswater.” In
1936 he had returned from Italy to live
in Bloomsbury until the Italian war-
scare blew over: —
I had read in letters to the Press
many hostile references to “the Old
School Tie,” as a symbol of snobbish
devotion to an individuality-crushing
old horrid system, and had thought
to myself, “What nonsense!” It had
never occurred to me to exercise my
right to wear this tie. But now,
here, in the heart of Bloomsbury,
I felt that I would belatedly do so,
and I went to my hosier and ordered
two Old Carthusian [Charterhouse]
ties. Do you know the colors? They
are three: bright crimson, salmon
pink, and royal blue. They are
dangerous to the appearance of even
quite a young man. To that of an
old man they are utterly disastrous.
Nevertheless, I, without faltering,
wore one of my pair until my
sojourn in Bloomsbury came to an
end. /
He was a literary clown who not
only said funny things but did them;
and he had that other important gift
of great clowns, a sense of timing. You
have to remember back to 1940. to the
time of the phony war, when the two
sides of the' world were poised ready
to tear each other to pieces across
Europe, and then to hear, in this awful
silence, a clear and precise voice
speaking of “The Top Hat.”
Beerbohm began with its history, went’
on to how it used to be worn “while
eating luncheon at one’s club,” how
“like one’s cat” it was dull on cloudy
days and had to be nursed back to
health after being spotted with rain,
how he had bought two irons, one for
the shaft and crown, one for the brim,
and had himself taught how to iron
it....
In its place in this book “The Top
Hat” is still a delightful and amusing
little essay, but to have read it in some
English magazine early in the war was
to feel that one had assisted in the
triumph of a most exquisite clown, in
which what he does not say is more
important than what he says.
RETURN OF THE
PRODIGAL SON
Years of terror, in the mud of years,
absent from the self; the self alone;
wounded like an animal and nothing real
but the closed reality of pain ■'
as hard and shut as stone, the thorn, the
land —
not even knowing that he took a way ;
but only that a change can bring relief —
not even seeing, even knowing what to say
to those who passed him on the furtive
road,
or any thought to see his father stand
beneath a palm-tree in a fly-blown shade ;
unaware of body, face or hand:
he stumbled on the roadway in the sun,
a mirage or a vision, falling, fell
and broke into the country of his heart;
and lay there drinking by its dying
well ...
O life that beat his head against the road,
O seed, oasis, O consenting heart.
Black with light a fountain wept ...
And knowing nothing, knew he must
_ depart.

Metaphysical Poets
The Metaphysical Poets, edited by
Helen Gardner, is the latest of the
Penguin Poets series. The metaphysical
poets were so dubbed by Samuel
Johnson, and they flourished between
1550 and 1711.
The first characteristic of the meta-
physical poets, according to Miss
Garner, is concentration. The second
is their fondness for conceits, and her
definition of a conceit is “a comparison
whose ingenuity is more striking than
its justness.” An example is “The
Flea” of John Donne (1572-1631): —
Mark but this flea, and marke in this,
How little that which thou deny’st
me is ;
It suck’d me first, and now sucks
thee,
And in this flea, our two bloods
mingled bee....
The main preoccupation of these
metaphysical poets seems to have been
with sex, like their Victorian successors;
but whereas the Victorian poets
expressed themselves in polite evasion,
the metaphysicals were more explicit.
Thus John Cleveland in “The Anti-
platonick”:—
For shame, thou everlasting Wooer,
Still saying grace, and never falling
to her.
Love that’s in contemplation plac’t,
Is Venus drawn but to the waist.
The more philosophical meta-
physicals recognise the existence of a
conflict in the individual. Thus,
Andrew Marvell in “A Dialogue
Between the Soul and Body”:
Oh who shall me deliver whole,
From bonds of this Tyrannic Soul?
Which, stretcht upright, impales me
so,
That mine own Precipice I go.
It makes an attractive book, robust
and thoughtful; and it is extremely
pleasing to see the metaphysicals thus
revived in this popular library.
M. G. S.
An Olympic Visitor
J. J. Walsh is the proprietor-editor
of the “Munster Express,” printed at
Waterford, Eire. He came out to
Melbourne with the Irish athletes to
look at the Olympic Games ; and the
“Munster Express,” which has pub-
lished his Across the World for Sport,
thoughtfully describes it as “his greatest
work.”
Mr. Walsh seems to have found Aus-
tralia in some respects an alarming
country. He says that, not merely dis-
liking criticism or “helpful sugges-
tions,” we “simply bristle when either is
advanced and proceed forthwith to be
hostile.” Whoever has bristled at this
most amiable of travellers should pro-
ceed forthwith to apologise ; for surely
there would be few who would cavil,
except perhaps at the spelling of
Mittagong, at his account of his flight
to Canberra:—
Climbing over the Blue Plateau,
we skirted Wittagong and Bowral.
Next we passed over Marulan, until
we reached a large lake. Shortly
afterwards, Canberra, the Common-
wealth Capital, came into view. . . .
The result is as near to perfection
as human-nature allows.
Again, surely Kylie Tennant will be
pleased, if a little surprised, at some
of his comments:—
Read what that reliable historian,
Kylie Tennant —and he is not. an
Irishman —bad to say on this aspect
of life in those days. “Then,” he
wrote, “there were the Irish. . . .”
In Sydney Mr. Walsh was told a
remarkable story about the Bridge,
which he relates not less remarkably:—
H ere, I was told later, I arrived
just too late to witness an unusually
exciting incident. In a depressed
mood, a middle-aged man was
ascending the lofty steel girders,
when he was seen by a dock-worker.
Sensing a suicide, the latter, making
an heroic, split-second decision,
proceeded to climb up after him,
calling to him, loudly and cheerily,
to keep his mind occupied. Up and
then up, they went, until both had
reached the pinnacle. Then, to his
immense surprise, he that was filling
the role of Good Samaritan, found
that the other was a friend of his
boyhood days! .... Eventually made
to realise that there was still some
sweetness left in life, the would-be
self-destroyer relented —and began
the descent from his perilous perch.
It took him some time to reach terra
firma. As he did so, a lusty cheer
was raised. And, in a commendable
spirit of charity and appreciation,
there was forthwith begun the
taking-up of a collection.
Back outside the Hotel Australia that
night the traveller met two kindly Aus-
tralians:—
Fearing it might be for the purpose
of an altercation, I braced myself.
My fears were groundless. Sensing
correctly that 1 was a visitor, they
came with an invitation to join them
in a nightclub.
He “graciously declined” this invita-
tion, however, and soon winged his
way to Melbourne, where he met
numerous Irishmen, including Arch-
bishop Mannix, closely followed the
fortunes of the Irish athletes and,
indeed, kept a keen and kindly eye on
those of all nations: —
I have already commented upon
Australia’s outstanding prowess in
the realm of aquatics. ... It was a
treat to watch the handsome, fair-
haired, 18-year-old Murray Rose as
he came up for air which he inhaled
into his powerful lungs through a
small aperture at the corner of his
mouth before he resumed his
“submarine-like” cleavage of the
water. His '“bag,” as I have
indicated, consisted of three gold
medals. . . .
And so, after briefly relating the mis-
fortunes of the Irish cyclists and the
history and geography of Adelaide,
Perth, South Africa. Dakar, the Canary
Islands, Las Palmas and the Bay of
Biscay, back safe and sound at last to
Waterford and the “Munster Express.”
It is a pity, though, that he didn’t
accept the invitation of those two
kindly young men in Sydney who
wanted to take him to the nightclub ;
they might have given him the Bridge to
take home with him, or at any rate
sold it very cheaply.
Talking of Books: Oliver Edwards
(Heinemann). These are short essays
from the “Times,” not in the customary
cool, polite style of reviews in that
estimable paper but light and charm-
ing. They are so short that, discussing
Conrad’s women, for instance, Edwards
hasn’t even time to mention their
wonderful speechlessness; which is a
little unsatisfactory, but has the possible
advantage that when he picks E. M.
Forster’s “Howard's End” apparently
as superior to “A Passage to India”
there is hardly time to disagree with
him. This occurs, incidentally, in a
list of twelve outstanding modern
novels, among which is included “The
Fortunes of Richard Mahony.” A
very pleasant book for anyone who
likes talk about books.
THE FLESH, THE FLAME,
THE FLOWER
The flesh, the flame, the flower
Are outlines, nothing more,
Enclosing in their forms
Spirit that was before
And shall be. Color, shape,
Waver and fade and change
But fire, life and growth
Continue, fresh and strange
As in the beginning of time.
All thought, all warmth, all scent
Embodied in such small span
And forms so transient:
The flower on its green stem,
The flame about the coal,
And fragile body of man
That yet can house a soul.
