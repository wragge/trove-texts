DR. KELLY’S REPUTATION IS SO THOROUGHLY ESTABLISHED THAT IT WILL
ONLY BE NECESSARY FOR HIM TO INTIMATE THAT HE IS PRACTISING AS A
SPECIALIST TO BE APPRECIATED AS A BENEFACTOR TO SUFFERING MANKIND. AS
THE GREATER PORTION OP THE NEW SOUTH WALES PUBLIC IS AWARE, DR. KELLY
IS A LEGALLY QUALIFIED AND REGISTERED PHYSICIAN, AND HAS BY PAR THE
LARGEST PRACTICE IN THE COLONIES. MANY PERSONS AT A DISTANCE, HOWEVER,
ARE UNAWARE OF HIS GREAT SUCCESS, AS, HITHERTO, HE HAS REFRAINED PROM
ADVERTISING. HENCE, TO WIDEN THE SPHERE OP HIS USEFULNESS, HE HAS
DETERMINED, BY MEANS OF ADVERTISING, TO MAKE HIMSELF KNOWN IN REMOTE
DISTRICTS WHERE HIS REPUTATION MAY NOT YET HAVE TRAVELLED. AS THE
QUESTION MAY ARISE, WHY DOES SO EMINENT A PHYSICIAN AS DR. KELLY FIND
IT NECESSARY TO ADVERTISE, HE MAY REPLY TO ONE AND ALL AS FOLLOWS
IP THERE IS A PERSON ON BARTH TO BE PITIED IT IS HE WHO IS OBLIGED
TO ASSOCIATE WITH HIS FELLOW BEINGS WHILE HIS MIND IS CONSTANTLY
HARASSED AND TORTURED BY THE CONSCIOUSNESS OP
WHAT MUST INEVITABLY FOLLOW.
HE LOOKS HAGGARD AND SHEEPISH. HE IS NERVOUS IN PUBLIC, AND EXTREMELY
GIRLISH AND BACKWARD IN LADIES’ SOCIETY. THE VICTIM OF THIS, THE MOST
DANGEROUS OF ALL VICES, IP NOT RELIEVED, SOON REACHES A STATE WHICH MUST
END IN LIFE-LONG MISERY. HE MUST ULTIMATELY SINK TO THE LOWEST STAGE
OF DEGRADATION AND SHAME. DR. KELLY MAINTAINS THAT THE PHYSICIAN WHO
HAS THE POWER TO CURE, AND REMAINS SILENT, IS GUILTY OP AN UNPARDONABLE
SIN OP OMISSION. PERSONS WHO READ HIS GREAT WORK ON THIS SUBJECT WILL
BE SHOWN THE INEVITABLE RESULT OP THE BAD HABITS, AND IN MOST
INSTANCES SUFFICIENTLY EARLY IN LIFE TO ENABLE THEM
TO SEE THEIR FOLLY
BEFORE ANY DISEASE HAS TAKEN POSSESSION OF THEM. THE BOOK WILL ALSO
SHOW THEM CLEARLY
HOW TO CURE THE DISEASE WITHOUT
THE ASSISTANCE OF PHYSICIAN OR CHEMIST.
MANY PERSONS WONDER WHY THEIR MEMORY IS NOT SO RETENTIVE, AND THEIR
GENERAL INTELLECT NOT SO CLEAR AND STRONG AS THEY FORMERLY WERE.
DR. KELLY’S BOOK WILL EXPLAIN THE CAUSE IN PLAIN . AND SIMPLE LANGUAGE.
THEREFORE, EVEN THOUGH YOU BE FREE PROM DISEASE, SEND FOR THIS GREAT
MEDICAL WORK, THAT YOU MAY BE ENABLED TO ADVISE OTHERS AFTER PERUSING
ITS PAGES. VERY FREQUENTLY THIS MAY BE DONE BEFORE ANY GREAT HAEM
HAS TAKEN PLACE.
SEE HIS PALE AND SALLOW FACE, UPON WHICH
DISEASE HAS LEFT ITS MARKS.

HIS MOVEMENTS ARE SHUFFLING AND UNCERTAIN, AND
BETRAY A MIND ILL AT EASE, HIS MENTAL OPERATIONS ARE
ERRATIC, HE IS EMBARRASSED, AWKWARD, AND ACTS WITHOUT
ANY FIXED PURPOSE, HE IS ABSENT-MINDED, AND GIVEN TO

SATURDAY, JANUARY 23, 1892,
The Duke of Clarence.
One day last week Albert Victor, Duke of
Clarence and Avondale, and lineal heir to
the crown of that empire on which the sun
never sets, succumbed to a complication of
complaints, and departed unexpectedly to
sleep with his fathers. The death of Albert
Victor was practically a foregone conclusion
when he assumed the ill-fated title of
Clarence. An evil fortune has followed
that dukedom from first to last the
Clarences have never done anything in par-
ticular, except die and leave no heirs behind
them. The departure of the last of them
has been attended by all the customary pomp
and riot of dead royalty. A period of mourn-
ing has been proclaimed in Britain. There
is a margin of deep black round the obituary
notices in the papers, and sundry bells have
been rung in a muffled monotone, and
sundry flags have been hoisted half-mast
high in token of lamentation. The London
illustrated papers, which usually devote
themselves exclusively to pictures of the
Prince of Wales laying a foundation-stone,
are hard at work fixing up fanciful sketches
showing horny-handed but mythical toilers
weeping over a loss that can never, by any
possibility, be repaired. And it is under-
stood, in a general and orthodox sort of way,
that the whole English-speaking races are
bathed in woe—and yet, excepting the royal
family, with whose grief we can all sympa-
thise on purely human grounds, the mourn-
ing is unreal enough. The departed Duke
was merely a shadow, and his loss is only
the breakage of a god in a pantheon. No-
body is glad he is dead, except the news-
paper men who have been paid for writing
his obituary ; nobody is particularly sorry ;
everybody is indifferent ; from first to last
there is no active emotion in the matter.
# * *
But, in an emotionless sort of way, The
Bulletin regrets that Clarence has de-
parted. He bade fair to be a great experi-
ment in the art and mystery of monarchy,
and new that experiment is spoilt past all
repair. He was, what he looked—without
exception the most utterly effete, colourless
and inanimate of the Guelphs, and his life
promised to do something towards solving
a question as yet unanswered—how far can a
king approximate to a mere, harmless, unin-
tellectual automaton without injury to the
monarchy ? The two first Georges were
coarse, hard, brutal, ignorant, immoral,
utterly callous, and dull beyond expression,
but they were strong men none the less, with
a species of bull-dog strength which did
them good service in stormy times. The
third was mean, stupid, grasping, partially
deranged, ignorant, and intensely okstinate ;
he was the turning-point of the race,
but in his lucid intervals he was still
a power in the State. After him came
a glittering mountebank and a fool with
an umbrella, and then Victoria showed
the Guelphic race minus much of its
mental energy, but with its physical strength
still unimpaired. Wales is an inferior
edition of his mother, with a certain shallow
shrewdness and a shattered frame ; and
Clarence came at the end of the procession,
with a ruined constitution, a vacant mind,
and a pallid countenance—the representative
on his father’s side of the worn-out dynasty
of England, and on his mother’s of the
effete dynasty of broken Denmark. Pos-
sibly he would have been a successful
monarch simply by reason of these deficien-
cies. In almost any other State he would—
owing to his stupidity—have been the last of
the Guelphs, but in England the first,
second, and third requisites of a sovereign
are that lie must be useless—more useless—
most useless. He must have no ambition,
no energy, no longing for action in any
shape, for these things all make a monarch
desire to do something, and the great pro-
viso of the British Constitution nowadays is
that he must do nothing—absolutely no-
thing. And Clarence was, in many re-
spects, so absolutely fitted to be an ideal
British sovereign that The Bulletin regrets
his loss. England will find it hard to raise
so nobly inanimate a person again this
generation.
# * #
The Guelphs, in these latter days, are
beginning to taper off towards extinction.
George of Wales, the new heir to the
Imperial crown, is an individual with a repu-
tation for physical vigour which is partly real
and partly owing to the fictitious portraits
published in the illustrated papers, but even
he is only the shadow of his brawny, hoarse,
red, hard-swearing, hard-drinking fore-
fathers—those old kings who kept a harem
of gorgons apiece, and ate every day as if
there was no hereafter. By British law he
is allowed to marry no one save a princess of
royal descent, and long inter-marriage among
the dreadfully unwholesome royalties of
Europe has reduced them all to one common
level of disease and weak-mindedness. There
has been a great want of healthy and muscu-
lar usurpers of recent years—of men who had
strength and vigour enough to snatch at a
crown and to hold it afterwards with a firm
grip against all comers—and for lack of them
the close corporation of monarchs is fast
becoming a corporation of imbeciles. If the
dynasty is to be preserved, it would be better
for the Guelphs that George of Wales
should marry a plain cook, with brawny
limbs and the blood of a long line of cart-
horses in her veins—better for the monarchy
even that, like Marshal Bazaine, he should
pick up his consort at night beneath a
lamp-post—than that he should bring a
princess of one of the old reigning
houses of Europe to the English throne.
The blood of Bernadotte, the private
soldier of fortune, lent a little freshnessto the
stagnant stream, but three generations of
intermarriage with contemporary dynasties
has reduced the Swedish house to the
customary level. The fierce courage and
tireless energy of the old pig-jobber who
snatched the Servian crown is gone, and his
descendents are incurable mediocrities; it
takes a wonderfully short time for a pig-
dealer’s sons to degenerate in the atmos-
phere of royalty. Therefore, George of
Wales, the effete son of a worn-out race, will
doubtless marry the effete daughter of some
other race equally decayed, and the Guelphs
will keep on going bad in public for the joy
and edification of the empire. All the
dynasties of Europe are going bad, and so
much public putrefaction is a cheerless
spectacle.
• * #
A tendency to crumble away suddenly is
one of the growing characteristics of the
Guelphs in recent years. They break up
unaccountably, like aged opium-eaters or
men who have lived on arsenic. The Prince
of Wales promises to die of old age while
his mother is still comparatively young, just
as his own son died—practically of old age—
at 28, while his father was still alive and
still capable of laying foundation-stones with
at least a remnant of his former vigour.
Albert Victor, even at his best, had hardly
the capacity to lay a foundation-stone ; he
was the emblem of a generation that was
born aged, and was too weak and nerveless
for any amusement that is fit for public
mention. If he had lived, however, he
would probably have been the father of a
line of kings, and the end of the
Guelphs could then have been foretold with
reasonable accuracy. Some day in the dim
future the last and feeblest of a line of
crowned imbeciles would have been for-
gotten and abandoned in his palace, even as
the deranged Charles VI. was in the halls
of the French kings, when the Duke of
Burgundy went prowling at night through
the huge, deserted castle in search of a
potentate who had been mislaid by his loving
subjects, and found the lost monarch half-
naked and hungry, crouching and gibbering
over a dying fire, and drivelling abjectly
among the ashes. Or else, it may be, the
last of the Guelphs would have been a re-
production* of the last of the Valois —that
monarch who dressed himself in female
attire, and spent his days at a spinning-
wheel, and wandered about his capital in a
carriage with his arms full of small dogs and
pet monkeys. In either case the British
nation is so loyal, or else so indifferent, that
it would hardly depose even a Guelph. The
last king of the dynasty will probably stray
away in the final stages of Ins mental decay,
and the monarchy will become extinct
through failure to recover him, and the
republic, instead of being established by any
fixed purpose, will come by accident. And
hero, again, The Bulletin wastes a vain
regret over Albert Victor’s demise. He
was so eminently fitted to leave behind him
a royal family like that famous House of
V Alois, which dragged itself to death through
200 years of wretchedness and howling in-
sanity -so admirably suited to rush the
royal line of the Guelphs through idiocy to
prompt extinction—that the unborn republic
sheds a tear over his dust and feels that it
has lost a friend.

It is an eloquent example of the irony of
fate, that only a few days ago the Parliament
of the Cape Colony voted a large sura of
money as a present to the dead prince, on
the occasion of that wedding which is now
postponed to all eternity. So far as we
know, the Cape Colony—under the guidance
of that famous “empire-builder,” Mr. Cecil
Rhodes —was the only one among the many
dependencies of Britain which took sufficient
interest in Clarence’s existence to waste its
revenue in his honour. Ten years ago, every
province of Australasia would have sent its
official contribution out of the public funds
and its outburst of grovel on such an occa-
sion ; now, no Australian politician would
dare to submit to Parliament a proposal that
such a thing should be done. But then, Aus-
tralia is new, and England is very, very old
and stereotyped. Therefore it is difficult to
foretell events, but the chances seem to be
that Albert Victor’s death is a great gain
to the British monarchy. The end of the
monarchical system and the beginning of the
republic will come, in all probability, only
when the last Guelph becomes so deranged
as to necessitate his being chained to his
throne, while he gives his royal assent to
Parliamentary enactments in a strait-jacket.
The deceased Clarence promised to accelerate
this consummation, and his loss has post-
poned it—for a time. But the result will
come all the same. The imbecility which
troubles all the royal houses of Europe is in
the Guelphic blood, and with every succes-
sive generation the disease makes further
progress.
The Quacks of an Ancient Race.
Great is Diana of the Ephesians, and England,
the modern Diana of that ilk, is so overgrown
with the magnitude of her stupendousness that
earth lacks atmosphere enough to carry off the
superfluous vapour from the fumes of her
national swelled head. Mr. W. T. Stead the
other day enlarged somewhat in a vigorously
glorified, inconsequential and illogical fashion
concerning the almightiness of the almighty
British empire; and he likewise published
many columns concerning three colonial builders
of that ungainly edifice—two of whom have
since died, the one in the flesh and the other in
the spirit—and now a person named Browne,
with an “e,” and a hyphenated prefix spelt
Crichton, and a vanguard of titular obloquy
figuring as Sir James, who is, moreover,
alleged to be an eminent physician, rushes with
gay alacrity to the forefront of the fight to save
the glory of the English-speaking race. He is
mortally injured in several parts of his
emotional anatomy by a consideration of the
wholesome fact that the expansion of Australian
universities has a distinct and healthy tendency
to lessen the number of students sent to
Oxford and Cambridge and other similar em-
poriums of concentrated essence of antique
prejudice. He regards—and herein is expressed
the Imperial Jingoistic faddism of the man
named Browne, with an “ e -he regards this
education of “colonial” youths at English
universities as important, inasmuch as students
would return to Australia filled with a love efi
England and of English institutions.

There has, within the past few years, grown
up an English-speaking - union cult which
vapours considerably about a connection under
one rule of the peoples who have their origin in
an Anglo-Saxon dictionary, but whose various
blood-strains are about as diverse as those of
the many races that go to make up the
Austrian Empire. Such a union is somewhat
of substance less than the pallid adumbration
of the shadow of a dream; for not only will
America and England never coalesce, but the
widening breach between England and her
colonies will continue to grow until it is
absolutely unbridgeable. And this will follow
simply because the question of sentiment,
which Imperial Federationists lay so much
stress upon, is not in the least involved. We
can never lose our part in the alleged
glories of the race, even though we were
separated from England ten thousand times ;
nay, even though the British Isles were taken
up bodily and flung into space or sunk beneath
the sea. Shakespeare and , Bacon, Alfred
the Great and Magna Charta will be as much
our property when we are a confederacy of
Republican States as they are at present, or as
they ever were. Literature itself belongs to
whoever can read and understand it, and in
this sense Lowell or Whittier belongs to us
quite as much as does Marcus Clarke or
Henry Kendall. But there is this difference—
Lowell and Bret Haute are distinctly Ameri-
cans. using the English language. The senti-
ment, the local colour, the local usages of
speech belong to their own country. The mere
fact of a common dictionary does not make the
literatures of different countries identical. If
one only cares to go back far enough, France,
Spain, Portugal, and Italy derive their speech
from a common source. They are, moreover,
designated the Latin races, when, as everybody
knows, they are made up of Kelts, Teutons,
Goths, Vandals, Huns—and many otherspeciesof
savages who variously and barbarously adopted
the polite tongue of the outworn Roman
gentlemen they overthrew. A common dic-
tionary as a basis of political union is about as
logical a proposition as a common interest in a
graveyard, a common possession of red heads
or wooden legs, or a common propensity to
colonial beer or ice-cream. In the Review op
Reviews, the other day, a Mr. Astley Cooper
proposed a scheme of Imperial Federation based
on cricket, boat-racing, and sprint-running ! ! '

Christie Murray tells a story of a young
Australian who was taken to see Westminster
Abbey, but who stoutly maintained the supe-
riority in architectural grandeur of the Ballarat
Town Hall. This is decidedly uncultured, but
it is highly gratifying to Australians, and
Christie Murray, as a consistent Englishman,
must admire, although he may pretend to sneer
at it. It is the sentiment that his countrymen
carry about with them from London to Paris,
to Vienna, to Rome, to Khartoum, to India, to
Hades. It is the sentiment which, when
spoken of by Englanders of Englanders, is
called patriotism ; when applied to “ Kaw-
lonials,” “ blasted impertinence.” For all that,
it has made Christie Murray’s country one of
the most hated by other nations of any under
the sun, and it is, moreover, one of the things
we do not want to learn from the great mother
and mistress ,of Podsnappery. As being indi-
cative of a wholesome distrust of the influence
of Gothic architecture on the unsophisticated
Australian intellect, we rapturously commend
the remark of the young man from Ballarat, for
herein lies a deeper philosophy than meets the
eye.
* * *
__ There is nothing so enduring as architecture.
The pyramids are Egypt, Athens is the Acro-
polis, ancient Rome lingers yet in the ruins of
the Forum. The Pope will reign as long as one
stone stands upon another in the stately edifice
dedicated to St. Peter. England’s Queen is a
section of Westminster Abbey. Think of the
character of Charles I.—was it not Oxford
University ? The boasted Constitution of
England is pure Gothic architecture introduced
into legislation. This is the secret of the in-
fluence of the English University. It belongs
to the recorded order of things. It is a memo-
rial of precedent upon precedent. Its quad-
rangles shelter Conservatism, and its courts
are bound in the spirit with the musty memories
of the past. Oxford is synonymous with narrow-
ness, with Toryism, with a frantic clutching at
the mildewed traditions of the Middle Ages,
just as London University is synonymous with
all that fosters what is broad, liberal, progres-
sive and scientific. Through the influence of
its splendid architecture Oxford dwarfs the
human intellect that lives beneath the shadow
of its venerable walls, and the man that there
sucks in his mental nutriment is bound hence-
forth and for ever to the continuance of the
order of things that be. He for all time is a
true and trusty adherent of Church and State
and Crown, and this is the reason why Sir
James Browne, with an “e,” desires our youth
to surrender themselves to the seductive in-
fluence of such hallowed homes of learning as
Oxford and Cambridge.
* * #
We love not England ! It is not for us ! For
this reason must we sternly refuse all modes of
seductive endearment. England belongs to the
venerable and moss-grown past—the past of
gray—walls of Gothic cathedrals, of kings and
tournaments, of knights and the burning of
many witches. England is a broad, expansive
moss-trooper with a policy of Freetrade and a
bludgeon of mediaeval sacerdotalism. In the
wake of the trader treads the bishop, about
whose vestments cling memories of Oxford and
Archbishop Laud and the Star Chamber and
many other iniquities. We are young and
coltish. We cannot afford Freetrade because
we have no standing army. Our weapon is not
a bayonet and Bible-supported rum-bottle, but
the axe of the pioneer. We do not favour
university education very much either, because
we are compelled to put our sons to some sort
of use, and a too close perusal of the ecclesiasti-
cal tombstones of the past lias a tendency to
unfit a man for the genuine work of a Repub-
lican and democratic existence. And, finally,
we do not want to be tied up to England
because she uses the same spelling-book. We
would rather spell “colour” without a “u,”
and go over to the United States as full-fledged
Yankees.
The Apotheosis of a Gaol Flogger.
By appointing the public flagellator, oneELLORY,
to the responsible and respectable position of
Governor of Deniliquin Gaol, the New South
Wales Government has administered to an
already sufficiently-detestable service a hypo-
dermic injection of the virus of the old Convict
System, under which the champion expert in
callous brutality was rapidly preferred to the
highest promotion. Clean, free minds will hold
no excuse valid for Minister O’Connor’s almost
unaccountable action, and for his quite unac-
countable defence of it. Parallel with this
hideous aberration, Mr. O’Connor has emerged
into official light as a minor Howard (not
“ Nosey Bob”) of prison reform, by being the
first New South Wales Minister for Justice to
issue to prisoners licenses-of-liberation, or
tickets-of-leave, under permissive provisions of
the Criminal Law' Amendment Act of 1883 ; and
that, too, without waiting for the slow red-
tapeism of the completion of a code of regula-
tions now in process of being drafted •. To
such a Minister of Justice, hopeful persons
looked for such reforms as the Abolition
of the Lash, and the Abolition of Capital
Punishment ; yet this same Minister abases
himself to do high honour to the odious office
of Public Flagellator —half-brother to that
of Public Executioner. Further, he apparently
glories in this Obi-worship, in a minute in which
he refuses to, reverse his action (italics ours)
Of the officers qualified fo fill this post, Mr. F.Ii.ORV
(think of the flower being a Mister!), by reason of his
service ani grade, stood first entitled to promotion. He
has a total service of over 17 years, and is a senior warder
of eight years’ standing.
Eight years ago, when Government re-in-
stituted the Botany Bay cat as a highly-
prized instrument towards the salvation of
prisoners, a departmental ukase was issued,
requiring prison warders to officiate upon the

The cancellation of Scourger Ellory’s
appointment must be insisted on, and such
insistence persisted in, both inside and outside
of Parliament. This country cannot afford to
re-inoculate itself with the cancerous lymph ot
a Btamped-out leprosy. So long as we continue
in the brutal folly of breaking necks and flaying
backs, in the desecrated name of Justice, at
least let Common Hangmen and Common
Scourgers remain as they have elected to
become. If the reason for Scourger Ellory s
sudden glorification is to be found in acts ot
past personal flunkeyism performed to any high
politician, then the latter and his friend the
Scourger should both be brought down together,
if the Scourger cannot be isolated from his
influential patron. Again, is not that influen-
tial patron afraid that some malice-nursing
prisoner may take the ex-Scourger’s life Is it
lobe left to modern convictism to wipe out this
reappearing stain of the old convictism ?
PLAIN ENGLISH.
“We.”
-Sir Softgoods Sargood, of Melbourne, declares
that the cry for One-man-one-vote is inoppor-
tune, and should first be preceded by strict
attention to business. Says this bale-full
warrior ;
We want to develops the resources of the colony (Vic"
toria), and to encourage the investment of money and the
consequent employment of labour.
In the first place, whom does Sir Softgoods
mean by “We?” The “development of the
resources ” of any province has hitherto meant
the borrowing of money in the name of the whole
people and the pouring of it into the aprons
of “ We ’’—that is, Softgoods, Hardware and
I'm The people don’t want any more of that.
In the next place, “ the investment of money
iloes not necessarily mean the “ employment of
labour in anything like an equal ratio.. The
employment is not “ consequent” on the invest-
ment. The “We” have taken care of that
also. The “We ” have scooped in the invest-
ments and left the employment to discover
itself. So that when Sir Sargood's henchman,
the. Melbourne Daily Telegraph, in one
■breath, dismally asks and predicts :
But suppose Mr. Suirls wins, and the new Assembly in-
cludes a majority .of members pledged to the “One-man-
■ one-vote” principle ? The effect abroad will certainly
mjure our credit, and cl tber postpone our next loan or
"'educe its price.
flie people do not care a crack o’ the thumb if
that is doubly so. The “ credit ”of the “We ”
no concern of the people ; the “ credit ” of the
people has hitherto been the Spanish Main of the
■“V\ e” who have been the buccaneers, “to
develope the resources of the colony ” for the
special behoof of the “We” should be the
people's first care; but to develope t hemselves by
extinguishing the marauding “ Wc ” that call
themselves the nation, and that, whenever the
feal nation makes au effort to discover itself,
spring the rattle of alarm that life and freedom
-for these are the stakes —are “ inopportune,”
because something the»“ We” calls “credit " is
m danger of being lowered. Until the people
‘HU nile themselves for themselves, and handle
for themselves their own resources, undeqnan-
titated by “privileged” boodlera who self-
-stylo themselves a national “We,” loans and
a other aids to ordinary progress are only
aggravations of the people's stresses, as afford-
-111 g bigger “steals” to the ever-vigilant,
uormorantic “ We.” In short, until one-man-
one-vote is achieved, and the “We” of Sir
- oi'TGOODs and Co. are cremated in the political
urnaces, no effort, however laudable in itself,
uo achievement, ’■■nifirally progres-
sive, is of uuieh, if of any, rise, since such effort
and such achievement will only serve to further
establish, glorify, and consolidate this usurping
“We.” March we on, then, without turning
to right or left, heeding no alarms, noticing no
lures, to this first goal—“ One-man-one-vote !”
The Elder Exploring Expedition.
The last telegram received from the Elder
“ exploring ” party, now threading their dan-
gerous way through outside stations, goldfields
and telegraph-stations, would seem to intimate
that the strike epidemic has reached even them.
The doctor, the geologist, the botanist, and
another man, have resigned in a body. As the
second in command resigned some short time
back, and another left at Esperance Bay, the
party will soon be in workable order, especially
by the t ime they kill a few more camels. For
pure humour, this so-termed exploring expedi-
tion will rank as the funniest in the annals of
our history. It is under the control of the
“Royal Geographical Society of Australasia,'
presumably so-called because most of the mem-
bers know nothing whatever about the geography
of Australia. They concocted a set of rules for
the guidance of their “officers,” and a map was
prepared whereon the country to be explored
was marked down, quite regardless of the fact
that a large portion of it was under settlement
and a good deal of the rest perfectly well-
known. The leader is noted as a smart man on
the Stock Exchange! and the members of
that institution gave him a dinner before
his departure. Since then the telegrams
that have come in have been a monotonous
record of visits to various well-known spots
and centres of settlement in Western Aus-
tralia. But the joke lies in the fact that the
people interested still persist in regarding it as
an exploring party. The leader sends and
receives telegrams and despatches. One of the
members of "the G.S. read a paper, in Hobart,
before the pseudo-scientific association, on the
doings of this wonderful expedition, and, to put
a climax on it all, the London Times —poor
Times I—had an article on some sensational
cablegram that had been sent to England,
bemoaning “ the future of Central Australia in
consequence of Lindsay’s unfavourable report.”
Wanted—A Crown Defender.
Ever since Magna Charta announced that
justice should not be sold, the richest criminals
have always hired the best lawyers, while poor
prisoners have had to plead guilty or else
blunder along to almost certain conviction.
The rich man can generally obtain an alibi and
an oration with enough points to crowd a
cattle-truck reserved for the Full Court; the
undefended prisoner may have bis interest
guarded by a Judge, who can do no more than
guess at the defence. Conviction depends in a
large measure upon the worth of a prisoner’s
cheque-book, and although poverty per se is no
crime, it commonly leads to conviction therefor.
These statements are not entirely novel; we
have heard something like them before on the
stage and stump and elsewhere, but we use
them for the purpose of indicating a plan of
improving the administration of justice. Our
present idea is that, until something better is
suggested, all accused persons should be
defended by a Crown Advocate employed to
defend, just as the Crown Prosecutors are now
employed to prosecute, and that no other advo-
cates should be allowed to appear for the
defence. This plan seems to be a little revolu-
tionary and otherwise objectionable until you
get used to it, but it has a lot of advantages
about it, and it has a recommendation by
analogy in its favour. Every reason in favour
of prosecution at State expense and by a State
official is at least equally strong as applied to
criminal defence. In England at the present
day only a certain number of crimes of strictly
public concern are prosecuted by the State ; in
other cases the prosecutor has to look after the
case himself and hire a lawyer to keep it going
for him. Here are the faults of such a system,
and the power it gave to the owner of
much coin to buy “justice ” in large quantities
induced the adoption of the method now in
vogue. In Australia the private prosecutor
may not even hire a barrister to “ assist
the Crown ; however anxious the prose-
cutor may be to get a conviction he is not
allowed to use his own coin for that purpose.
All cases are prosecuted under this regime with
an even quantum of skill, but defences are
“ prepared” and conducted with the very
highest skill and care, or else not conducted at
all, according to the financial circumstances of
the accused. But to the latter part of the rule
there is one exception. Years ago it dawned in
a vague kind of way upon the Judges that it
was really not quite fair to a man who was
being tried for his life, to be left to his
own” ignorant helplessness in meeting, the
charge preferred against him, and the cus-
tom then obtained of “assigning” the
youngest barrister who happened to be
loafing in Court, to defend the prisoner.
Generally the prisoner was not much advant-
aged by this assistance, but the expedient gave
an appearance of favour to the accused.
Recently in N.S. Wales the practice was
extended one long step further. Now, if any
person accused of a capital offence is without
means to employ counsel, a solicitor and a
barrister are retained by the Crown and paid
to undertake the defence. Parenthetically it
may be noted that since the inception of the
rule referred to, hardly any prisoners arraigned
on capital charges have had any money for
their defence: their sudden and almost universal
poverty dates from the change in the practice.
The rule is good as far as it goes, but logically
its extension to cases not capital is necessary.
If it is unfair to a man on trial for his life to
leave him without legal assistance, it is unfair
to try a man on a charge involving penal
servitude for life at similar disadvantage.
If a man accused of murder has a claim on the
Treasury for means of defence, why should
another nian indicted for cattlestealing be re-
fused aid ! The distinction is illogical. Am],
on the other hand, as prosecutions are a public
charge, why should not defence be so ? Is the
public more interested in proving one side than
the other of a criminal question? The Crown
pays a Judge to see fair play to both sales, and
then pays a Crown Prosecutor to prove one side
of the case to the Judge, while the other side
of the case is left wholly to the arbitrament of
the almighty dollar or the absence thereof.
Crimes are of public concern. It is of public
consequence that the guilty should be convicted
and the innocent be acquitted, and these results
will never bo reached until all persons are
defended as they are now prosecuted, by a
public official, and with fairly level professional
skill. The Crown Defender should be the next
addition to the Public Service.

The V.R.C. Committee recently sent a circular
to every registered trainer, jockey and book-
maker in the province warning them that their
licences may be revoked if they maintain any
professional connection with unregistered
meetings. The rapid increase in the ranks, of
racing loafers around Melbourne quite justifies
this autocratic legislation. In every big city
there are hundreds of men ready to throw up.
work and degenerate into “followers of the
turf,” provided that the supply of petty meet-
ings is sufficiently continuous to keep the
infatuation alive. The more racing, the more
followers or hangers-on there will be to give a
seedy, raffish, blasphemous taint to those big
turf shows which have hitherto been accepted
by the public at large as excuses for fitful
bursts of decent dissipation. For business
reasons, pure and simple, the V.R.C. and
kindred clubs are bound to aim at preventing
their solid patrons from being scared off by the
discovery that the social standard of race-goers
is getting lower. And if the inevitable
tendency of unregistered meetings is to
create miserable adventurers and foul-mouthed
vagabonds (who, as they swarm in and
out of race-trains, serve the moralist as shock-
ing examples of what betting brings us to) they
ought to be wiped out, anyway. Also a number
of small registered meetings, where robbery is
as rife as wrangling, and blood and hair fly
about at the slightest provocation, might very
well be wiped out at the same time. 'The most
desirable class of race-meeting is that which
attains to the dignity of a social function, and
where the impetuous bank-clerk is not quite
out of the influence of his “people.” More-
over, a little bit of such function every
now and then is as much as anybody
requires. It is the cant of sporting papers
that the demand creates the supply. As a
matter of fact, supply acts as an evil stimulant
to demand. One State lottery every year
would not enervate the industry of a country,
nor would the annual setting up of a licensed
gaming-table for a couple of days turn Aus-
tralia into a Monaco. But the too constant
presence of inducements to bet on horse-racing
creates a betting habit, and transforms a cer-
tain number of what might be harmless sup-
porters into hangers-on, who ultimately drag
their “ sport ” down into the gutter.

Mr. W. Dudley Flinn, of the Victoitan
Democratic Club, writes thus :
Dear Bulletin, —Your comments in current issue con-
cerning H. J. Wbixon do him great injustice. He is a
veteran member of the Legislature and held office as
Attorney-General as far back as 1870. His personality
has secured him a unique place in our politics, and he is
certainly a square man above toadyism, and the alleged
“ honour ” recently conferred on him has probably come
unsolicited. Anyhow, he never made professions of
extreme radicalism, nor proclaimed his contempt for
titles in the scathing terms attributed to Robert Stout
True, he has .been associated with politicians who
are not in the odour of sanctity with Radicals,
and while contaminated by contact with them he
officially fathered the reactionary measure which you
rightly reprobate, but politicians, like travellers, are oft
times discovered in suspicious company. Nevertheless,
lie has rendered the State some excellent service. His
energetic action in the highly important An Toy appeal
case which he really conducted before the Judicial Com-
mittee of the Privy Council with marked ability, and
which resulted in a reversal of the judgment of our
Supreme Court, and a decision from the highest Court of
Appeal in the empire which established the legality of
legislation by self-governing colonies restricting or ex-
cluding people of alien race, even horn subjects of the
Crown, from such colonies, merits generous acknowledge-
ment from Australasian Radicals. For this service
he received a most hearty and unanimous vote
of thanks from the present Assembly. More-
over, last session he introduced a Bill which abolished
the odious 6 George IV. Act relating to conspiracy in
industrial disputes, and also repealed that portion of . the
Masters and Servants Act which gave exploiters of labour
unjust powers. This Act, which H. J. Wbixon introduced
in an admirable speech, brings Victoria into line with the
latest labour legislation in Great Britain, and is
undoubtedly the most valuable achievement of this Par-
liament from a democratic standpoint, and it is safe to
assert could never have been passed into law by any other
member in the present Parliament. His valuable work in
connection with the Mallee Select Committee.deserves
mention. Sir Henry J. Wbixon has consistently
supported the abolition of plural voting, and
has always strenuously asserted the supremacy of
the Assembly-when conflicts have arisen, or threatened
to arise, betwixt the popular and the unpopu-
lar Houses. He is a most respected member of our
Parliament, whose knowledge, assiduous attention to his
duties, arid dispassionate treatment of vexed questions,
renders him invaluable in debate, and his withdrawal
from Parliament would he a national loss, which, though
we favour antagonistic schools of political and economic
thought, would be deeply regretted.

From Sydney Telegraph’s daily leader on the
beauties of Foreign-trade :
Nothing can be more obvious than that a law which is
intended to specially serve one interest or section of the
community can onlv do so at the expense of the others.
As Mr. Cotton stated the case, a community left without
interference to the exercise of its activities will employ
them to the best purpose.
This is a very large order, and a very insane
one, but of late the Telegraph has taken to
throwing comprehensive generalities off' its
chest in an absolutely reckless manner. Ninety-
nine out of every hundred laws are intended to
“ specially serve one interest or section, of the
community,” for nobody can draft one hill
large enough to serve everybody. The Early-
Closing Bill which the D.T. booms is intended
to serve the shop-assistants only. The
Sydney Electric - lighting Company’s Act
which 'it screams for so persistently is for one
section of the nation only, unless the D.T.
can prove that the light will ho visible at
Bonrke or Wilcannia. The Single-tax prin-
ciple, which it smacks in a fatherly way on the
back, is only for one section —the absolutely
landless class, and the One-man-one-vote system
only serves the class which hasn’t got plural
votes. Every thing the Telegraph ever howled
for or ever will howl for is open to the same
objection, and by its own showing it should
block the Broken Hill Water Supply Bill,
because that measure is only drafted in the
interests .if one town, and the Irrigation pro-
posals because t hey only do good to certain dry
districts, wherefore both of them must be
injurious to the country at large.
The amount of gold extracted from five of
the partially-cleveloped tnfnes at Yilgarn (W.A.)
during 1891 was 15,000 ounces.
The disappearance of the kangaroo from
the more settled districts of West Australia has
been the cause of a motion in the W.A. Assembly
instituting a close season for that animal for a
period of four years. A compromise was agreed
to, protecting the kangaroo from October to April
each year.
On the same date that the S. M, Herald
published Henry Lucy’s narrative of how the
Princess Teek came to be called “ Cousin
May,” its London cableinan suddenly commenced
to call her the “Princess May,” although he- had,
right up to the previous day, known her only as
“ Princess Victoria.’’
The severity of the drought in the North
West portions of Western Australia is causing
great loss of stock to pastoralists, and it is not
improbable that the'W.A. Government will have
to forego the current year's rents from the
squatters. Scab is also raging with virulence
among the flocks of the Northern stations.
In the Queen’s Bench Division the othej
day, the Leeds Daily Times was proceeded against
for having reproduced stories from Household
Words without permission first obtained (it was
not deemed that the tales had been acknowledged).
On defendant’s counsel giving an undertaking not
to repeat the offence, the motion for injunction
was not proceeded with, but the piratical pro-
prietor was cast in heavy costs. By the way.
Kentledge, who is a “hot member,” is on the
track of a Sydney paper published every day.
Dear Bulletin, : —ln a recent number 1
saw quoted a paragraph (from an article in a
London magazine) concerning a certain horrible
growth in the luxurious looks of a certain empress.
You say, or rather the article referred to says,
that such a disease is unknown to medical men.
Perhaps to English medical men, but not at all
unknown to medical men on the Continent. I
have seen sufferers from this disease with my own
eyes. It is called, in the vernacular of the
country, “ Welchselkopf.” The Weichsel is a
large river, on the banks of which this malady is
most prevalent. It is perfectly true that this
horrible growth has a nervous system of its own,
as the miserable sufferers know to their cost. I
could tell a horrible story about it, Which I know
to be perfectly true, but out of consideration to
your readers, who have only one nervous system
apiece, I forbear.—Yours truly, Rattle Sang,
Freemantle, W.A., 6th Jan., 1892. [You were

horrible story at once—instantly—-full speed. Ed.

Dear Bulletin,— Thompson, of Sudds
and Thompson notoriety, though “ disgraced and
degraded ” by Governor Darling,” was not “done
to death ” by that excellent old gentleman. Sudds
was ; Thompson survived some years, and I will
give to the world the particulars of his later life
some day. And, by the way, I may as well
mention that Sudds’ name was not Sudds. It was
Studds, and as such it appears in one, at least,
newspaper report of the time. My informant was
in court the day the two soldiers were charged
with larceny—the offence which led to the subse-
quent infamous proceedings—and had a distinct
recollection of hearing Studds spell his name in
correction of the magistrate’s clerk. But a
common private had no more light to his name
than he had to his soul, at that period, and,the
Court called him Sudds, and Sudds he will
remain, for that is the appellation.burnt indelibly
into the Australian conscience.— Price Warung.
It is related that in the early days of St.
Paul’s College, Sydney, students were few and far
between, and at one time there were only two on
the books, Ranny Want and Kees Jones, now of
Rockhampton. Some benevolent old gentleman
had endowed two scholarships in Divinity, and of
course these young alumni were entered for them.
The day of examination arrived, and they duly
appeared, gowned and capped, hut by no means
eager for the fray ; for, to say the least, neither
had been reared"in an atmosphere of piety. Inc
of the posers put to them was “Give a short
sketch of the life and adventures of St. Paul, with
references.” Ranny, who had been cramming
“Butler’s Analogy ” and kindred works, seems to
have had some cloudy notion of the subject, but
poor Rets was utterly flabbergasted owing to his
total ignorance of anything, connected with the
history of the apostle. When he had to tackle
the paper he turned to his neighbour and said ;
“Who the deuce was St. Paul, Ran., old man?”
They both took prizes, and Ranny was first.
Writes a Bulletin correspondent from
London concerning a certain notorious English
turfman :
Everything must come to an end sooner or later in this
world, and not even Mr. —’s colossal fortune could
stand the inroads he made upon it. He inherited the
best uait of a quarter of a million in hard cash and about
£70,000 a year besides, but such has been his reckless
expenditure that he has knocked the bottom out of it,
and is now, if not exactly hard up, at. least in a fair way
to being so before long. He lias obtained legal consent
to bar the entail of an estate on condition of his paying a
sum of about £40,000 to heirs expectant. This will of
course he sold, and when that is gone he will he like
Benzoin It is only those who have seen the wild way in
which he has thrown money about who can form the least
idea of how reckless he is. I have myself seen him sit
down and draw a cheque for £lOO and give it to a very
ugly barmaid in a music hall when she reminded him
that it was her birthday—which it very probably was not.
I cite this as an instance of how he scattered money.
What men like Mitchell and Carney have had out of him
goodness only knows. The cost of hjs stud must be
fabulous, for he has horses in training all over the
country. The announcement of a weedihg-out sale is
very suggestive. About a year or two more will about do
for him, now that a certain lady whose photo, we all
admire is dragging away at his hank account. Tin
Marchioness of cost him £50,000; and those who
have seen her will admit that she is dear at the money.
Perhaps the most, noteworthy series of
contributions to English journalism since Russell’s
Crimean letters has just been concluded in the
letters of “ Veins ” to the Times on the Army and
War-office administration. They have been
attributed to General Ohesney, and ho was called
upon by Broderick, Under-Secretary for War, to
“ exculpate ” himself from the suspicion of having
written them. Ohesney, however, repudiates the
authorship, while bearing testimony to the
remarkabihty of the letters ; and the few words in
which he trounces Broderick spit that upper-crust
Bumble as fatally as a naturalist’s pin does a
moth. “ Vetus’ ” conclusion—editorially adopted
by the Times— is that the Army system of Great
Rritain is rotten to the core; and that the War-
Office is a model of vicious bureaucracy. The
Bulletin would not be surprised to find that
Colonel Maurice turns out to be “ Vetus.” Who
ever the writer, he must bo a man of extraordinary
courage to attack the “ruling classes” in their

846 Maoquarie-street North, Sydney, January 20, 1892.
My Dear Moorabinua,—
If Royal etiquette reared its hydra-head in Australian
“court circles” as in England, Lady Jersey’s Maori-
land sprint would be put off until next summer, and I am
prepared to prove that she’s not a social economist if she
doesn’t postpone it, anyhow. Every excuse should be
seized on by the Gov. and his consort which leads to a
solemn withdrawal into their moated grange with a “no
admission” notice hanging over the portcullis ; the full
period of seclusion for the demise of the Prince ought to
be observed to the semi-second by the Jerseys, who could
thus tide over the summer very comfortably in complete
immunity from tennis-parties and tea-parties, with no
grunts and wails about their inhospitality wafting from
the fashionable recuperating districts either. And next
summer—which may present no royal excuse for squelch-
ing the social aspirations of the living embodiments of
the visiting-list—next summer when ruralising sassiety
will expect to be stoked with tea and strawberries on the
paddockish vice-regal lawns at Sutton Forest, Lady
Jersey should beat a strategic retreat to the Land of
Kauri and so give her natural enemies the slip two times
instead of onoe. But if M. E. Jersey isn’t the opportunist
suggested above, she will have fled N.S.W. for Maori-
land, accompanied by her brother, Captain Leigh, and
Lady Galloway ere these logical hints blush in black and
white, and Jersey will be stranded a lone, lorn grass-
widower.
Apropos of our leading lady’s outing, she isn’t going to
let Maoriland off so easily’ when she dawns on that windy
nation, for a Kodak camera (the portable little affair
Baker and Rouse, its commercial god-fathers and god-
mothers, are so pardonably proud of) goes with her to fix
scenic morceaux all along the line of trip. Lady
Jersey, judged by specimens of her handicraft, couldn’t
keep out of the insolvency-court as a practical photo-
grapher, but her amateur efforts, aided by a good
camera, encourage her to go ahead. Quite a harvest of
Kodaks resulted from the recent vice-regal South-western
flight.
A London journal eulogises the Jerseys in a recent
issue, stroking their fur the right way, principally because
of the dexterous manner in which they balance on a
social rail. “Both,” purrs their distant admirer, “have
made themselves equally acceptable to the local Radicals
and Tories, while Lord Jersey has proved himself the
best Governor N.S.W. has ever had.” Now, “George”
—in the short space of 12 introductory months (it is
exactly a year since he arrived)—has lavished his gracious
patronage on every entertainment, short of a dog-fight,
that began with a bar of the national anathema, and
has shed the light of his whiskers on more public-school
(iz-gigs, bazaars, banquets, foundation-stones, fire-engines
and bun-struggles than I could tick off if 1 had a whole
newspaper to do it in—but he isn’t the darling of the
populace, and neither is his literary sposa. Coming after
the free-and-easy Carington regime, the Jerseys’ action in
tliscountenancing, for one thing, mob receptions, has
frost-bitten the cupboard-love of three-quarters of their
lady “subjects.” The fickle Government House females
could have worshipped Lady J. in as hysterical a manner
as they adored Lady C. if Lady J. had been prepared to
suffer their fulsome homage on fixed afternoons and
nourish it with free victuals, but she wasn’t, and there-
fore the female population of N.S.W., taking it “by and
large,” does not exactly idolise her. It isn’t the Aus-
tralian fashion to worship before the altar of an unknown
goddess.
Awstralian tippy-tops have been hugely depressed ever
since the cabled news of the demise of the Royal bride-
groom-elect appeared in big black letters in the papers,
and favoured damsels who, during his Australian visit,
were beckoned out to dance with the deceased Prince
(who always left them to find their own way to their
chaperones when the dance was over—after the manner of
Royalty), and girls who managed a stilted court-etiquette
sort of frozen flirt with the pale and solemn princeling on
his visit to our wilds 11 years ago, do now assume a soft
and pensive melancholy—as of one whose pet canary has
recently suicided in its water-supply. And they have
adopted weeds of ceremonious sorrow, too, but alas!
Court mourning as comprehended in Australia by the
suburban lady whose earthly paradise lies behind the
sentr}' at the gates of Government House, is a pie-
bald and ludicrous outbreak of loyalty. When-
ever a Royalty dies, the female Tory, who is
ever in our midst, rakes among her black-haired
belongings for a pair of gloves, a pair of hosen
and wide crgpe arm-band and an utterly funereal-death-
and-cypress-looking-hat—all of which she pits against the
saddest coloured garment in her wardrobe—and her
sartorial sorrow is complete. The inside of a “fashion-
able” church the first Sunday after the exalted demise is
the place to see the eccentricity of local “ Court mourn-
ing.” Black badges on frocks of every colour; hats
trimmed like flower-pots with red roses, blue forget-me-
nots (do you say that “ blue forget-me-nots” is superfluous
detail? I was shown artificial pink forget-me-nots the
other day) with a blot of something black to screw the
rainbow down to disconsolate pitch-such an out-and-out
burlesque of the real thing! But genuine Court grief
doesn’t run to a band or two of black pinned on for a day
or so just because everybody is wearing it; black silk or
some soft material is de rigueur—nb crepe is worn, and
you cease to let your grief well up, as it were, in your
wearing apparel at the expiration of a period (usually
three months) solemnly set forth in the Court Circular.'
While the princelets were here brother George ran
rings round his elder brother so far as popularity went
and yet if the former visited us again in his brand-new
capacity as next-mler-but-one to the throne of England,
Society would nrobably find its royal favourite quite a»
noli me tangere as his eldest brother was. It must be a
harassing position, that of a king in pickle, let out on a
chain with a reverend tutor at one end of it, and tanta-
lisingly accompanied by a frolicsome, unimportant, jol-
lier, nianlier-looking brother who can dance and flirt with
pretty well whom he likes, while the sacred youth fore-
doomed to the Crown must sit apart in gloomy grandeur
watching his pious tutor picking irreproachable partners
for him and minding all the pretty girls. Yes, regarding
him as an inoffensive kinglet who joyed innocently in
luminous linen, one feels rather sorry for the poor young
man, for his whole life was sapped and blighted by the
awful dignity of his national inheritance. If he was
(figuratively) kept in the same glass case as he was all the
time in Sydney, he must have been quite glad to get
away to a .better land.
Sydney Women’s College is to have as Lady Principal a
specially-imported Englishwoman, and the local girl-
graduates toiling along the thorny track of culture must
be greatly encouraged thereby. What is the good of our
women fagging the best years of their life away in pursuit
of top-grade book-learning if the only guerdon going is a
teachership in some suburban school or a governess-ship in
the dreary bush ? What is the use, I reiterate argumenta-
tively, of putting ice on your skull to keep your brains
from addling while you work up for your M.A, degree, if,
when a position opens out that is worth the risk and fag
of the thing, you are invariably set aside in favour of an
alien female who accepts the billet as if she was con-
ferring a favour, and possibly vaguely wonders what pro-
portion of the Sydney girl-students will be black gins ? Of
course—in the case of the Principalship just decided—the
Australian women who having “ minded their book” con-
sidered themselves fully’ competent for the position were
not debarred from sending their names in to the com-
mittee (in London) consisting of three English school-
marms, Sir Saul Samuel and someone else. But they
would have stood precisely the same chance if they had
referred their cases to the Sultan of Turkey.
One reason why Englishwomen have a “ walk-over ” for
all Australian educational sinecures is that sassiety—in
its out-reaehings after everything English—yearns for a
British lady’ of “tone” rather than a mother-know-all,
and the alleged want of “ finished manner ” about the
locally-produced lady pedagogue is the reason why she
isn’t a prophetess in her own country. But this is a
chimera. Sooner or later Australia will have a separate
national life and no more imported marionettes to give
object-lessons in “good breeding ” and how to eat gravy
with a fork, and the sooner we face our destiny and
behave according to our own lights, leaving drawn out A’s
and the “Piccadilly lurch” to their British originators,
the better. Why can’t we make our own good manners ?
Will Australians never recognise the vulgar aspect of
second-hand social tone ?
There’s a great deal of awed whispering on the subject
of the “delicacy and refinement of English habits” that
is hardly corroborated by the manners and customs of the
Briton when carefully’ observed. One Simonpure female
from across the pond was wont to pick her teeth with
her first finger—at the table, too. I have seen a “ noble”
Governor mimic a pianist before a crowded concert-room,
while his noble wife was convulsed with merriment
behind her lace fan ; and everybody has met and suffered
from the culchawed Hinglish young man who is cordially
made welcome by Australian hostesses, and returns their
kindnesses by 7 rude, shallow “criticisms” of a continent
to which nobody asked him to come, and in which
nobody’ would care how soon he left. These are just a
few samples of English manners on the jog, but perhaps
you don’t get the full bouquet of British “ tone ” —as it
were —unless the Briton’s foot is on his native heath. As
a rule he doesn’t seem to pack it for long sea voyages.
When a certain Governor took a recent flight some-
where in Barataria the train drew up at an inland station
thronged with the usual mob of inland sightseers. No
preparations had been made to adorn the station before
the Queen’s under study passed through, yet when that
distinguished individual loomed at the carriage- window
and began his flatteries his first remark was to thank them
for decorating the station in his honour. The crowd
thought it was a sarcastic allusion to the oversight, but
when the train moved away and they 7 “came to” the
mystery was soon solved. The signalman's red and green
flags were carelessly hung on the wall and the Governor
had mistaken them for loyal bunting !
There’s generally fun on the Border when the Customs
fiend is pawing his way’ through passengers’ luggage with
his chalk between his teeth, and so the other morning a
deeply-interested crowd gathered round the baggage of a
well-dressed man and woman who had come out of the
Sydney express and whom the Customs officer obviously
had his eye on. “ You’ll ’ave to pay jooty on all these,’’
he said, as he unearthed eleven brassy-looking teapots,
ten butter-dishes, and a forest of fish-slices in one trunk,
but the male owner sought to prove it wasn’t a smuggle.
“ They’re wedding-presents, yer know,” he said easily,
but if he expected that that bald statement would satisfy
the official he knew not his mark. The placid Border
detective only opened the lids of the eleven brassy tea-
pots and drew forth a bundle of cigars, gloves, and laces,
a nice little collection of durabilities altogether. “ We’ve
had the weddin’ prisint dodge before,” he said, senten-
tiously.
By the by, in South Australia—and all over this vast
continent for all I know (fiscal conditions are so puzzling)
—wedding presents are dutiable. A bride and bridegroom
recently whisked across the Border with a regular haul of
gifts, which were coldly appraised by the man with the
chalk, and the bridegroom—being in a whirl of bliss, 1
presume—shelled out his last farthing almost to pay the
duty. It was only when the honeymoon had waned that
he began to see that he had crippled hia income through
getting a square mile of jfiated, unnecessary utensils out
of pawn—but what is the good of venting your rage on
the cat when the thing’s done?
Riches have nasty little ways of taking unto themselves
wings occasionally—but some people oil their pinions in a
manner of writing. The latest alleged Juggins of the
mining exchange is an Australian man of inherited
millions who, it is whispered, has been a regular baa-lamb
among the broking black sheep of Collins-street West.
Not only plausible male speculators, brimming over with
golden scrip, but plungers in petticoats took a running
jump at the evening apotheosis of Tom Tiddler’s ground,
and one fair financier well-known all round “ let in ” this
confiding human gold-mine for £20,000 ! Some of her
dear friends were also put on to the golden goose, who
shed pen-feathers to the amount of £40,000. And the
consequence is—as the round game says—that the two
sons of this bamboozled dad will probably discover when
the will is read that to be born with a spoon in your
lantern jaws is no earthly assurance that the gilded ladle
is going to hang there for ever.
About Melbourne goes the whisper of the engagement
of a rich girl (now sojourning beside the Yarra) to a
wooden-looking Sydney militaire. The engagement is
kept a deep, dark mystery by the culprits concerned—on
account of the youth of the fiancee, they say—but every-
body is gradually getting to know all about it and
congratulations are flocking in.
That ghastly union between May and December entered
into not so long ago at an Australian country ohuroh, the
ceremony followed by a dejeuner at the local public-’
house, whence the guests fluttered to town by the last
train, leaving the happy turtle-doves to begin their
honeymoon among the ruins of the wedding-feast, isn’t
likely to last lonu. The ancient bridegroom is suffering
from dropsy, and grave hopes are entertained. Now, if
the venturesome bride has played the connubial cards
like a sportswoman, his demise will leave her one of the
wealthiest women in Australia.
Yours affectionately.
SAPPHO SMITH.
Cardinal Manning.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
The heart of Labour throbs with pride and grief—
With pride to think that he, who now lies dead,
Stood in the workers' van—a valiant chief,
And bow’d before toil’s shrine his mitred head;
Ay, pride should be allied with grief to-day,
For princes now but seldom lead the poor,
but he was proud to walk the Master’s way
A princely priest of stainless life and pure.
He fought the People’s fight and won the love
Of those who hold the hig, broad faith in deeds,
That faith which makes for Right and leaps above
The bolts and bars and barriers of creeds,
That faith whose watchword is—“ God help the weak !
God help the friendless ones, and the distress’d !
God help ! God help all those who succour seek !”
This was his motto, who is now at rest!
From this new land we send a wreath of song—
A simple garland for his saintly bier—
The friend of justice and the foe of wrong,
His sacred mem’ry shall be treasur’d here—
And treasur’d, too, wherever heaven’s ray
Shall light the spark of brotherhood in man,
The splendid beacon of the coming day
When we shall have revealed God’s mighty plan.

THOMAS BRACKEN.
Two sharks caught at Chowder, Sydney,
last week, measured 14ft. 6in. (7ft. 2in. girth
and 16ft. (6ft. 2in. girth) respectively.
The decline of Freetrade in N.S.W.
Assembly has been very rapid during the last
decade. In 1885 the House numbered 4 Protec-
tionists ;in 1887, 42; 1889, 67; and in 1892, 75
out of a possible 141.
One gleans, from English notices, some
rather strange things about the early career of
Bishop Perry, formerly of Melbourne. He began
life as a freethinker, wherefore the good young
men of Cambridge were warned against him.
History again. Hare and Nicolson have
been writing absolutely contradictory accounts to
a Melbourne paper, although they are both police-
magistrates now, about* bushranger Power’s cap-
ture, and it only remains for police-superintendent
Montfort to give his—which he won’t, being a
modest man, as well as brave.
The pitiable spectacle presented by G. H.
Reid during the discussion which arose in the
N.S.W. Assembly the other evening, concerning
the question whether the new Sydney Post-office
frontages should be leased or sold, is a ghastly
illustration of the fate which sooner or later
inevitably overtakes every trimmer.
Those well-known Sydney artists, Messrs.
A. Collingridge and C. H. Hunt, have arranged
for the disposal of some of their pictures by art
union. The prizes number 32, and are valued at
£5OO, ranging in price from A 4 to £lOO, and com-
prising both oil-paintings and water-colour draw-
ings. The works are on view at the artists’
studio, 55 Norwich Chambers, Hunter-street.
“ Glorious News. Death of a pauper.
£50,000 per year saved out of the taxpayers'
earnings.” Such was the horror chalked on the
pavement, the other day, in front of the Trades
Hall, Melbourne, and of course people are always
most angry when you tell them their own
thoughts. Therefore did the minion of Murphy,
Trenwith, and Hancock rush for a mop.
The Duke of Fife —the ambitious Macbeth
was Thane of Fife —begins to loom up as a
dangerous-looking personage. Just imagine his
feelings towards Prince George, how anxiously he
craves and prays that this beloved Prince may
never have typhoid again ! Why is it expedient
to place such fearful temptations in the way of
any human creature? General Kellermann said,
“ Bonaparte saw the French Crown lying on the
ground, and picked it up with the point of his
sword.” Such prospects kill all natural feeling,
an experience which is one of the Republican
foundations.
Parkes foams at the slightest reference to
the “ Whereat ” episode in his parliamentary life.
Ten years ago, nearly, Parkes was kicked out of
East Sydney; and he was obliged to fly from the
hustings before the enraged populace, and seek an
asylum in the house of a Hebrew, in Castlereagh-
street. No constituency would have him at any
price ; and but for the grace of Whereat, the only
candidate for Tenterfield, Parkes would have had
to seek a refuge in the Council. The trick on the
Tenterfield electors was worked very cunningly.
Not until it was too late to run an opposition
candidate, did Whereat retire and apply his forty
sovereigns to nominate Parkes—to the confusion
of the constituency. And Parkes is indignant
because he once owed a seat to the pity of a
protectionist!
Sir Samuel Griffith, the British diplomat,
is dragging the Queensland Premiership in the
dirt. Under the plausible plea of reviving inter-
provincial interest in his Federation fad he ia
quietly button-holing the Premiers of N.S.W. and
victoria, theleadingprovinces,on the chances, they
say, of extracting a bigger subsidy towards the cost
of the protectorate of New Guinea. With what
object ? To put the finishing touch on his recent
mission to New Guinea ! The red-letter day is
fast nearing—only a year or two off - when no
black-labor can be longer worked on the Queens-
land plantations. And with a view to robbing
the white-labor vote Griffith has arranged with
Sir W. Macgregor to receive an influx of sugar
planters, under specially favoured conditions ; and
he is now negotiating for an increased vote all
round the provinces in aid of the Queensland
Black-labor Employing Association. Will the
Anstralias sanction the revival of niggerdom
within coo-ey of their shores? And if Queens-
land vetoes the production of sugar with black-
labor will it subsidise a protectorate which affords
a haven to blackleg Queensland planters?
It is most convenient to have a first-class
room near tram stopping places, where ladies
can rest themselves, and if they choose, have a
good cup of tea, or other refreshments. We
the Country Milk Oo.’s “ Cascade,”
80 and 82 Elizabeth-street, near King-street, is just
the place; it is certainly the largest and best-
conducted room in Sydney, and is getting quite
the fashionable resort for afternoon tea. We also
understand that ladies who so desire can have
parcels sent there, so that they can call for them
just before taking the tram for home.*
To the inventive genius of a lady in 1843
are we indebted for the first ice-cream freezer,
but those ladies who wish to save time, labour,
and money invest in the new German Freezer.
Why ? There is no handle to turn, not half so
much ice used, and it keeps the cream firm in or
out doors. Two quarts of ice cream can be made
for Is. fid. to Is. fid. Send for Sydney testimonials
to T. A. Knight & Co., St. James Chambers,

SUNDRY SHOWS.
SYDNEY SHOWS FOR COMING WEEK.

Theatre Royal “ The Forty Thieves.”
Her Majesty's “Babes in the Wood.”
MELBOURNE SHOWS FOR COMING WEEK.
Theatre Royal “ Dick Whittington.”

„ thing.”

Alexandra Pantomime (last nights).
Societies Gardens Sells’ Circus.
The Theatre Royal continues to be the
best-filled house in Sydney, and weather or n 0
weather “The Forty Thieves” appear to be a
force strong enough to overflow the treasury. The
pantomime would, however, stand a little bright-
ening up. The gags are growing mildewed, and
the songs are becoming decrepid. Fred. Mason’s
coster sketch is growing musty, and Rose Dear-
ing’s whistling song commences to lack the
inspiration of an encore verse. One of the
brightest glimpses of the show is the seductive
Dora Green well-like business of the “Fairy Four,”
whose dainty quartette of “Hush-a-by Baby,”
and the school-girl ballet, are worthily provoca-
tive of the muse of the poet whose Chief delight is
in histrionic faery-land, only, unfortunately, he
doesn’t live in our street. Mr. Gordon’s scenery
is one of the things that do not stale ; but did he
paint the tableaux introducing the transformation
scene ? They consist of four pictures illustrative
of incidents in the life of Siegfried as interpreted
by the musician of the future—Richard Wagner—
and for eight more such pictures we would gladly
forgo the transformation-scene itself, the harle-
quinade, and the entire libretto of the “ pankv-
mine. ”

The Christmas edition of Maggie Moore,
in Lincoln - green with trimmings, meanders
delectably at Her Majesty’s, and many things
transpire of no particular interest to the general
public at the same place of amusement. One of
the radiant entities that show up vividly against
a black back-ground of impossible villainy, is the
shadow-dance of Bella Bash all, which, while
reflecting no little credit on the lady in question,
brings into strong relief the omnipotence of the
principal performer in all the pieces staged at this
particular theatre—-to wit, the immortal man who
works the limelight, whose genius has saved a
myriad shows, and whose effulgent efforts have
redeemed numerous tanks of real water, and saved
the reputation of many a blood-stained Agin-
court. The wonderful sensibilities of the stage-
moon, which ever dogs the footsteps of the star
who draws the biggest salary, were never so happily
exemplified as on the boards of Her Majesty’s, and
it’s only just that the unseen genius who works all
the most striking effects should be suitably
acknowledged. Geo. P. Carey has recovered
sufficiently to undertake the small inebriate part
of Friar Tuck, and be does it so well that we are
sorry he is not amassing wealth in a more serious
personation. Outside Maggie Moore, everybody
is trying to do his or her best—with that lady
herself it comes natural, and calls for no special
remark.

At the Criterion the “ Mikado ” wuc to
a rainy conclusion on the 16th inst., and was suc-
ceeded on Monday last with a two-nights revival of
the “Pirates of Penzance.” On Wednesday,
“ Patience ” was produced, for the first time iu
Sydney by this company, and we should be sorry
indeed that they had gone away, were it not for
the fact that their vacation of the boards heralded
the return of the Brough-Boucicault Comedy
Company, which appears to-night (Saturday) in
“ Uncles and Aunts.” Young Alf. Stephens has
shown an ability in burlesque-acting and a versa-
tility incharacterisation which should bean earnest
of something worth-while to come, only we are
reminded, by the case of the historic Master
Betty’s failure to realise the promise of his youth,
that precocity is anything but a guarantee of
mature success. Little Lily Stephens also is the
one juvenile maid out of a pretty numerous bevy
who abuts considerably into the realms of our
perception, and we are rather glad on behalf of
the susceptible Sydney youth, that she lacks
several years of dangerous seventeen.
** * *
“ Uncles and Aunts,” now staged for the
first time in Australia, is a farcical comedy by W.
Leatocq and Walter Everard, and Tom Cahnam
and Charles Fabert, two comedians lately
imported from England, have been announced as
additional allurements. Brough himself super-
vises the season, and he announces the production
of “ New Lamps for Old,” “ The Solicitor,” “The
Barrister,” and a genuine collection of comedy
novelties.

The Polytechnic is now drawing fairly
well, and on the 16th—it is alleged, inconsequence
of the imposition of the new tariff duties—Felix
Tanner began in this neatly-furnished catacomb
the interesting experiment of living on air, water,
tobacco-smoke and irrelevant conversation for
fifty-one days. The air, conversation and tobacco-
smoke are almost synonymous items, and are sup
plied free of cost by the frequenters to this cheer-
ful vault. Mr. E. Lloyd Lewis has temporarily
abandoned clairvoyancy and conjuring, and his
place on the stage is occupied by a fighting
kangaroo and a skating maniac.

A burnt-corked individual looked cheer-
fully over the void of Sydney Garrick the other
night from the vantage of the stage, and remarked
hilariously that there wasn’t five pounds in the
house. This was the Cogills’ epitaph ! On the
same evening they decided to steal away to New-

George Musgrove’s grand opera scheme
doesn’t seem likely to fetch them in Melbourne,
where a limited meeting of music patrons sup-
norted the motion in a despondent key and sug-
gested that times were bad. Even if the guarantee
monev were raised in each city, and Muzzy
brought Sir ’Gustus’s show along, the chances are
that Melbourne would find the singing no better,
if not weaker, than that of the unfortunate
Siraonsen company, which are just now out of
business. Simonsen’s people can give a fane
operatic performance and might have been another
Bernhardt boom at the Princess’, under William-
son’s management. Instead of which they were
produced in the wrong operas, at the wrong
theatre, in a style so mean and paltry as to create
a suspicion that they couldn’t be half as good as
they seemed.

A series of promenade concerts will be
given in Sydney Centennial Hall on Saturday
(j an- 23rd), Monday, and Tuesday. The pro-
gramme is long, the list of artistes is formidable,
and contains a multitude of good names, and the
selections are of a kind calculated to soothe even a
Goth or a Vandal. Mr. Walter J. Turner
officiates as musical director.

The talented Greenwood family have taken
the Royal Standard Theatre, Castlereagh-street,
Sydney, for January 2G, and 28, and will, with
competent professional assistance, give on these
dates some high-class variety entertainments, after
which they think of visiting the provinces.

“Dick Whittington ” booms along at Mel*
bourne Royal quite regardless of the Age boycott,
and the free-list is still haughtily suspended
“ except to members of the press on duty. ” The
leading daily oracle has no member on duty. Pro-
prietor Syme waves his paws, like Podsnap of old,
and refuses to recognise the possibility of a panto-
mime existing without his august approval. Every
other Melbourne show receives the sanction of the
Age two or three times a week, but the name of
the Roval has been wiped off the books of that
enraged journal. Even the advertisement columns
breathe no mention of “Dick Whittington’s”
presence in the land, and the great Coppin
spectacle is in much the same position as a late-
lamented Roman citizen who was considered to be
especially honoured by the omission of his bust
from a public display of heads of the people. In
short, the Age, by striving too hard to avenge
the expulsion of its deadheads, has made a huge
ass of itself.
* # *
“Dick Whittington ” is advertised by the
beauty of Brunton’s scenery, and the lavish
magnificence of a pageant which probably sur-
passes anything of the kind previously put upon
Melbourne Royal stage. Furthermore, it is re-
markable for elegance and skill in the dancing
department, and a few other matters. The
beauteous Billeo Barlow has always fetched them
with two of her best music-hall ditties, and now
that a melancholy event prohibits any loyal
reference to the Duke of Clarence’s marriage,
Billee’s popularity will become more marked.
Lilian Davis is another festive young person,
whose legs speak for themselves, whilst George
Walton occasionally pops up to special advantage
amidst a lot of capable performers. An artist
like Edwin Kelly was last week playing the very
minor part of old man Fitzwarren in somebody’s
stead.

The Alexandra pantomime has nearly
reached the end of its tether. A benefit to the
author of that short-lived annual was to come off
on Tuesday, and his work will come off altogether
after Saturday next (23rd), leaving the rival enter-
tainment to enjoy a bloated monopoly of good
fairies and coloured fire. “Jack the Giant-killer
has drawn fairly good houses, but it never looked
like a genuine stayer from the first.
** * *
“The Merry Monarch ” is likewise retir-
ing from the throne in disgust. At the outset he
earned a bad character for gilded stupidity and
flashes of dreariness, and this detrimental cele-
brity has seemingly stuck to the potentate, despite
his subsequent endeavours to improve. He lias
many good points about him, indeed. The way
in which he goes for foreign embassies with a
singlestick is worthy of all praise, and his large-
hearted manner of assisting an elopement in high
life proven him to be every inch a king. One way
and another the M.M. and his nautchy ballet have
established a solid claim to a revival at some
future time. Elton, however, is said to be
actually going away anon, on which account the
management announces a round of William’s last
appearances in favourite operas prior to the pro-
duction of “ La Cigale ” and the new prima donna.
On Saturday he is to appear as Polydoro in “The
Old Guard.”
*» * *
“ Much Ado about Nothing” seems to be
holding its own at Melbourne Bijou. The ground
floor of the pretty little house is generally
crowded, and the dress-circle supports the Bard
very freely, considering that his simple narrative
is not exactly fin de sieclc. It can’t be said that
the performance throws new light on the character
of any immortal creation, or explains whether
Benedick was really struck on Beatrice before the.
play started, or Beatrice intended to “bunch ”
Benedick under any circumstances. The possible
state of Hero’s feelings towards Claudio at the
end of a long honeymoon with that hysterical
young man is nob suggested by any subtle inflec-
tion of the voice, as far as one can hear, nor does
Anson give such a masterly reading of the im-
mortal text as to make it certain that Dogberry's
maternal aunt ever thought of running away
with the footman. The B. and B. company give
a plain, straightforward interpretation of the
comedy, taking Shakespeare as he comes. Some-
times he comes a bit heavy, but the scenery pulls
him through, and his worst witticisms are fortu-
nately too old to be understood.

Sells’ Circus draws its eight or te 11
thousand people a day down to the gardens
Richmond, In a general way the show is con-
sidered immense, although the hypercritical find
fault with it for not being quite as marvellous as
the posters. The hippopotami, for instance, simply
trot round a dry track instead of swimming up
the circus in fifteen fathoms of river, and the
other wild animals as a rule forget to show all the
teeth they display in the coloured picters. On
the other hand, though, the Bedouin Arabs make
more row than might be expected, and the clown
elephant sometimes throws in an extra piece of
entertainment by swallowing the bottle after-
taking a drink. The circus will fold itself up and
steal ponderously away on Friday of next week.

The talented Japs, from distant Tokio,
wherever that may be, are attracting attention at
the Gaiety Hall, and some other shows remain as
usual. At the Exhibition an International Tug of
War was started on Monday, under wide-awake
management. About fourteen different nations
or provinces are represented in this struggle for
supremacy, and as each nation has to tug the
other nations until it is beaten four times the
chances are that they will all be tugging for the
six days of this week. Why the nations should
thus furiously rage together and pull opposite
ways is not made quite clear, but the admission is
one shilling, and reserved seats are Is. 6d. extra.
The advantage of having a reserved seat is that
you can see the perspiration dropping off the
nation’s brows and catch the several accents of
their grunts.

At Melbourne Bijou next Saturday after-
noon (23rd) there will be a strong all-round
performance for the benefit of Mrs. G. B. W.
Lewis, who is about to bid Australia a long-
adieu.
At Poverty Point.
An indignant Sydneyite writes to a southern paper
complaining of Maloom's being left out of a list of the old
circuses. Malcom was indeed the Sydney Hengler, and
bought the Ark from Noah. Few people sp-e aware that
he seated his pit with the boards, while others made the
baulks for his horses, and his myall pipe was turned from
the lid of the window which let out the dove.
As soon as ever a man is appointed an auditor, he
becomes mentally paralysed. We turn up the 40-year-old
case of Walter Walts, in London, and And that everyone
agreed that complete audit reform must ensue. Watts,
a mere under-clerk in the Globe Insurance Co., embezzled
£70,000, in six years, applying the money to theatrical
speculations at the Marylebone and Olympic Theatres ;
he hanged himself at last in Newgate. It was he who
brought out Mrs. Warner, at the Marylebone, in Shake-
spearian rivalry to Phelps, of Sadlers Wells, and he
fetched out the Yankee, Anna Cora Mouatt, in style, with
her lovely illuminated grotto dressing-room, under the
stage.
Mrs. G. B. W. Lewis complimentarily benefits at
Melbourne Bijou, on her departure for England,
This is Rose Edouin, going home to see brother Willie,
after educating ever so many clever people in the way
they should go on the stage. We don’t suppose Sells’
circus will turn up in commemoration of G. B. W. Lewis

afterwards known as the Princess’.

The Taylor-Carrington Dramatic Company has worked

Organist Jude writes from Brisbane to say that
he had the reverse to empty houses at Maryborough,
where he did very well indeed. He reports capital
business as far up as Townsville, and states that his organ-
recitals in Brisbane drew large crowds. From Brisbane
he goes to Maoriland and Tasmania, and hopes to spread
organic culture through 41 towns.
The MacMahons have done big business at Sandhurst
and Ballarat with “Evangeline.” “The Corsair,” too,
was considered a satisfactory leg-show in the mining
districts, so the brethren would seem to be in luck again.
Simonsen talks of bringing out another tragic prima
donna in place of the invalided Guidotti, and giving his
Italian Opera Company another chance. The relations
between lit tle Martin and his principals are not uncordial,
seeing that all salaries were paid up to a week or so
before the season closed, and the people who could least
afford to wait received a quittance in full. In the mean-
time there should be little difficulty about keeping such
a fine lot of singers together on the concert lay.
The gorgeous Eastern dresses in “ Dick Whittington ”
were sold to the Melbourne Royal agent, in London, by
poor Mrs. Langtry, at a genuinely alarming sacrifice.
They were built for the famous “ Antony and Cleopatra”
show, which collapsed before their glory had time to
fade.
Plain Bill Holloway has secured the Australian rights
of “Gloriana.”
Bateman and O’Grady’s dramatic company have been

In a company of barnstormers now “doing” back-
block towns of N.S.W. there is an actor w f ho bills himself
as “ Mr. Wilson Barrett.” Another of the same company
calls himself “George Coppin.” For nerve these
two stroil.us come up very close to a new Australian
chorus-girt, who .told a manager not long since that her
name was “ Lily Langtry.”
Montagu Williams told an interviewer, the other day,
he was sure John Brougham wrote “ London Assurance.”
He knew Brougham and Boucieault intimately, as mem-

The news of Majeroni’s death is commented on in Italy.
Everywhere he is recognised as a line actor, treading

Miln does well in India with his Co., and is likely to be
back in Australia unless he goes from Japan to’Frisco.
However, w ith Laurence Barrett gone, and Edwin Booth

blocks, and even Chicago will welcome its wandering
parson.
Williamson is satisfied he has a tramp-card in Miss
Halton, prima donna, just to hand, consigned by H. H.
Vincent, “with care,” &c. Her training was French, her
artistic successes have mainly been American, though
she has the London stamp too. So “La Oigale ” rattles
in rehearsal, and will be a big draw, though the newest
thing, “La Basoche,” is better. J. C. W. had “La
Cigale ” planned for Xmas, but wouldn’t do it without a
prima donna.

Florence St. John said One funny thing during hei
divorce-suit. She deposed that on a certain occasion her
husband was drunk. Asked how she knew 7 this, her reply
was “ because he was ‘ so affectionate.’ ”
Florence St. John and Marius appear to have been
really in love with each other for some time, but their
affection has turned into positive hatred, at least on the
lady’s side. “ Mons.” seems still to have some regard for
her, for according to one of his letters he actually wept on
one occasion when he heard someone at the Pelican Club
singing a ballad called “She is not all she was to me. ’
Fancy sentiment of this kind at the Pelican !
Beerbohm Tree told a story at the Playgoers’ Club of a
house-painter who had applied to him for employment as
an actcr in the Hayraarket Co. The painter said: “I
enclose you a cutting from a newspaper to show you that
I have some aptitude for the stage.” The cutting was as
follows; “The prisoner, who denied the charge, con-
ducted his own case, and defended himself in a somewhat
dramatic manner.”
Aimiie Moore, lady journalist, dramatic light of the
Austral Salon, announces she is going on the stage, after
the frantic acclaims bestow ed on her Juliet in the balcony
scene. Poor little things!—a lot they know about the
stage, with their bits of balcony scene, which are to hoist
them into Essie Jenynses right off. Look at Gwen. Floyd,
after her big hit in “ The Dancing Girl,” and here she is,
at the same theatre, doing a wretched leg-part of a few'
lines in the pantomime, while impudent Lilian Davies
takes off all the honours. Gwen, hasn't even learnt to
high kick.
At last advices, Johnel Sullivan was very much boozed
in ’Frisco, and was pursuing his theatrical career
under difficulties. The audiences were small, and Johnel,
as the blacksmith, insisted on shaking his hammer at
them, and w 7 anted badly to “put a tail” on somebody.
Also, he took to falling asleep standing, and most of the
time he forgot bis part. Consequently, when he ought to
have uttered some noble and manly sentiment, he only
looked about with a drunken glare and said, “ Blast them
newspapers and when he should have been rushing to
the rescue of somebody in distress, he generally lurched
to the footlights and offered promiscuously to fight any-
body or everybody for forty million dollars, and the
heroine in distress had to rescue herself the best way she
could.

In case any misconception may arise con-
cerning a letter from a correspondent, - printed in
last issue of The Bulletin in connection with the
alteration in the composition of the old-established
firm of Gordon and Gotch, it is as well to state
that the firm will continue, as heretofore, to trade
under the old title which is so extensively and
favorably known throughout Australasia.
A young fellow was the other day arrested
at Forbes (N.S. W.) on a charge of deserting an
illegitimate child, and was taken in handcuffs to
Albury, 200 miles distant. When confronted
with the child and mother, the latter shrieked out
that this was not the man, whereupon he was let
go. “ But I’ll bo the man if you like,” said the
ill-used suspect: and a few days saw him leaving
Albury with a wife and an adopted child. And
this happened within the magistracy of “Rolf
Boldrewood,” the novelist. Not many wives come
per warrant and handcuffs.
The impending strike in the Northern
collieries of N.S.W. will just about damn the
Newcastle coal-trade, as matters arc at present.
Queensland, Japan, and other coal-producing
centres will chip in for all they are worth, and as
a reliable export place Newcastle will be dis-
credited. A countervail to this injury may be
found in so fostering N.S. Wales industries, that
as much of its coal output as possible may be pro-
fitably utilised locally. In this direction Protec-
tion may yet be the saviour of the N.S. Wales
coal-trade. In respect of the dispute itself, it
will always stand out prominently that the
associated coal-masters took the first ugly step by
giving notice of a reduction in the hewing-rate
by a re-adjustment of the sliding-scale. The men
tried to arrange matters specially with the non-
associated masters, who certainly had a chance to
“collar” the market, but these
failed. All the masters are sticking together to
reduce the hewing-rate from 4s. 2d. to 3s. 10d..
their ostensible excuse being that they have been
enamelled to reduce the selling-price.
HIS “BOOK.”
he wrote the book of the panto.,
Evolved all its rollicking fun ;
'Twas he did the topical ditty
Thai’s whistled and sung through the city-
lie’s Prince of the Primitive Pun.
He wrote the book of the panto.,
His wife has just borne him a son ;
They say that she swears at his wheezes,
They say that at home he just freezes—
But the panto, will have a big run.
He wrote the book of the panto.,
The curtain’s rung up, it’s begun,
There’s a joker who jokes like a martyr,
And his wife, who’s a terrible Tartar,
With a fist that weighs nearly a ton.
He wrote the book of the panto.—
His child has a terrible cough,
And he says, when you call his book funny,
“ Yes, hang it, for I’ll get no money
Till the panto, is finally off.”

CORRESPONDENCE
“J. Fitzpatrick” (J.): “ Morning ” has been
(I esc rilled by the poet who wrote “ Genesis” and by every
other bard from that day to this. Try something: Aus-
tralian, and do not put so much “doth” into it
“ Kohimana ” : What are you trying to do ? If you must
deal in sweets open a lolly-shop, but for the sake of decent
verse leave rhyming a10ne.....“ Martin T.” : “ Mea
Culpa ” is good, but we do not see where the mea culpa
comes in. You rail rather against the limitations of
existence than against yourself, and you conclude that
your way is not clear, hence your song is unsung, and
there is surely no personal offence either against God or
man in not seeing your way clear ? “ S.W.”: “Madame
Bntre Nous ” and “ Cranky Ben ” are very good of their
kind, but they are also rather too long. Will let you
know later on if we can use either of them
“ J. S. Ryan”: “Pegasus at the Pawn-office” is a neat
conceit, but it would take a Heine to treat it properly,,
“ Tanglefoot Joe ”: We do not want to know how much
you love “ Ada.” Besides, the stuff is neither poetry nor
prose. Make up your mind what you are going to do,
and do it—but don’t wobble between the extremes of
rhyme and nonsensical prose “John Gordon”: “A
Blacks’ Tradition ” is not at all bad, and it’s not by any
means very good—the scanning doesn’t pan out well in
many of the lines. Another thing, recognition of
gallantry is not an exclusive British virtue. There is no
nation under the sun more ready to acknowledge a
gallant action in a foe than the French, for instance..
“ Idyllic”: The maid and the kerosene is just the sort of
thing for “ Ally Sloper.” Short stories are your forte .
“P.P.”: “Two Curly Locks” is well written, but it’s
insufferably goody-goody—the sort of thing G. R.
Sims used to unwind about the virtuous coster or the
unregenerate bishop who had still some good in him ..
“A.C.S.”: M'Cann went ultimately to San Francisco,
where he edited the Examinee under the name of W. 11.
Neilson.... “ L.L.” : The expenditure of £200,090 on
Sydney Centennial Park is a real enough debit; but the
money realisable from the sale of the Centennial Park
frontages can’t be looked on as a credit, as it has been
specially devoted by an unrepealed Act of Parliament to
the erection of Parkes’ dead-house—“A Tent-Dweller”:
Many thanks for verses and good wishes, but we don't
care" to give ourselves marmalade....“ R.R. ”: Grand-
Master Powderly, founder of ti e Knights of Labour, is a
cast-iron Protectionist, anyhow 7 —“Culloden Moor”:
Many thanks. .. “ Quippe ” (Cooktown): Many thanks..
“ M. 8.” (B.) : Thanks. Handed to artist.... “ Billy Bong”;
Many thanks. Glad to hear from you again “ A.L.L.’ ;
Yes, we can tell you a place w'here it ought to pay well to
start a paper... / O.E.J.’:The article may be original,
but you know you didn’t write it. It is in the hand-
writing of a man w 7 ho died fourteen years ago.. .“Jim
B.”: Better ask the Townsville Herald —we cannot say
what view t hey would take of it. Sorry we can’t as a rule
indulge in the luxury of private correspondence,. “ Chikle
Harold ”: We have no time to read plays. You could get
a professional opinion by paying a fee—“ James M.”
(Montalbion): There is nothing wrong. “Between you
and me ”is correct. “You and I” is only used in the
nominative “Tanglefoot Joe” : Will consider......
“Neigh” (Armidale, N.S.W.): “Tim’s” “Lay of the
Old Nag” is most hopeless doggerel “Bareback”
(K.): Tub Bulletin doesn’t see how Scourger Ellon , as
the head of a N.S.W. State department—as Under-Secre-
tary for Flagellation—could be “promoted,” unless ho
were made Chief Hangman or Colonial Secretary
“ Esquire ” ; The “ Esq.” feather in the tail of a name is
now a meaningless symbol of snobbery, lineally descended
from a freak of caste. “John Smith” should be suffi-
cient to indicate a man so named, even the “Mr.” being
superfluous, since “John” indicates that he isn’t a
“ Mrs.” or “Miss” ; and if he were a junior, “Master”
would come in. “ Esq.” always reminds us of a horse
with a bottle-brush tail—even the flies insult it....
“Cheapness” (Orange, N.S.W.): And you might add
nastiness. Figures are tiring and mostly useless. Bach
set of circumstances has its own figures. For instance :
Since 1887 Cow Flat (.N.S.W.) has increased in population
just 125-fold, and in wealth 1000-fold; while Bullock
Hole, (Vic.) has only increased in population 2|- times
over, and in wealth about 20-fold. Who is to say which
is the more progressive, Cow Flat or Bullock Hole, barelv
on those figures? Yet that is just the sort of argument
figure-compilers rely on “Boiling Billy”: Received
with thanks “Dunbar”: Can’t stand the man who
does the talking all through your poem. The Australian
bushman doesn’t say “ Sir” thirty-two times in a column,
and he isn’t utterly “ h”-less. Your character is a badly-
disguised cockney ...“G.S.D.” (Sydney): The clowns
death is the only feature in it, and so many people have
died that way, that a man might almost as well remain
alive “8.L.” (Newcastle): You say lynch law sup-
presses murder. Bosh. Lynch law is murder The
United States is the home of lynch lav., and
it has now the highest murder rate in the world.
Italy was ahead till a little while ago, but in the U.S. the
murder rate is always growing.... “Jockey ” (Brewanina):
Thanks. But our own opinion of jockeys isn’t very higli
“H.A.C.”: It may be a good Maori legend, but we
have known a red-headed girl named Jane Smith who did
just the same thing, and nobody thought anything about
it—only she was spanked for getting her clothes wet. ..
“Bathurst”: Rather illegible. Grievance hard to get at
inconsequence. . “ Werdna Yelnah”: Quite unsuitable
“Bung-Eye” (Redfern): (1) All true democrats should
he Local Optionists on principle; the local majority lias
the right to rule in local matters; (2) The teetotallers
are often the best friends the publican has - they
actually secure his monopoly by preventing fresh rivals
competing with his trade; (3) “Three knocks and a
scratch” is generally an “Open sesame” to most pubs,
on a Sunday ; but some have arbitrary private signals, as
two, four, or five knocks, given according to arranged
rhythm. When in doubt, “ask a perleeceman.'....
“H.A.C.”: The “Phantom Canoe” seems to be a very
purposeless piece of wood at the best “ Carbeco ”: Not
much in it; the tale’s h0110w....“ L.P.W.” (Warrnam-
bool); Three pages of musings in the dusk Deside a tomb-
stone are too much. Will cut out the musings and the
long sodden grass when we have time and publish flic
rest “B, Kennedy”: The artificial egg story is five
years old, and now the S.M. Herald publishes it as a
’fresh discovery, and you dig it out and send it to us as a
great find. .J.8.W.” : Tim Bulletin is a Protectionist
paper, therefore we throw your stupid Foieign-trade
paragraph back at your own imbecile head. Send it to
the Daily Telegraph or the lunatic asylum
•• J.M.A.”: Verse not bad. but we have sixteen
quarts of poetry on hand on the same subject ..
“ C. 8,” : Items strike us as too spiteful to be of all-round
interest. .. “A.J.”: In Australia there are as yet, we
believe, but five qualified female medicoes, but plenty are

Brooke’s farewell speeches were written by James Smith.
“E. Sorenson ” ; On a reasonable estimate, one-third
of the voting power of N.S.W. consists of bricks and earth
and similar intelligent substances.... “L. 8.” (Carcoar):

“ Moyarra,” advertised as “a new poem

Newman and Manning didn't “hit it.”
When Newman went over, Manning clung tight

The late Bishop Perry (Vic.), addressing
a Sunday-school audience, once gave vent to this

Ihe audience sniggered, and Mrs. Perry looked

The late J. G. Knight’s masterpiece was

An Australian journalist had a collection
of about four hundred bits of verse he had from
tune to time contributed to the Melbourne and
Adelaide weekly press. After keeping them for
some years by him, a fa Horace, he thought he
would revise them for publication in book form.
Going over them, he burnt three “pomes” as

unsuitable for reproduction. She burnt the lot.

“Mr. T. A. Browne, P.M., of Albury,”
writes a Bulletin London correspondent,
“ should now be making money out of Ids books,
which one sees in almost every house one visits.
He may thank the initial puff which Mr. Glad-
stone gave to ‘Robbery Under Arms’ for this
popularity. Whenever the G.O.M. is entrapped
into praising a book, the author’s fame is made.
11 is quite a common query now at Mudie’s ‘ when
do you expect another book by Boldrewood V Mr
Browne had better let the world know his real
name, by giving it, as well as his nom dc plume, on
the title-page of his next novel. A good many
people think that ho is identical with a by no
means literary young man (who spells his name
without an ‘e ’), who was for some years in the
service of Brown and Co., wine-merchants, of
Spring-street, Sydney, and who has since inherited
two or three fortunes from his father and uncles,
who made no end of money in past times out of
that very prosperous firm.”
The other day in the Transvaal two youno
British subjects, Cooper and M‘Keone, were tried
before the Chief Justice for robbing Kaffirs. One
ot the prisoners was a iad of under 20 ; the other
was 2b. They were undefended, and had not the
slightest suspicion that their lives were in danger
but on their conviction the Chief Justice dis-
covered that by the Dutch Common Law highway
robbery may be punished by death, and he put
tiie old law into force. When the last mail left
Capetown the two men were to be hanged on the
following day, but we have not heard how the
matter ended.
The late J. G. Knight, architect, who died
the other day in the Northern Territory where he
was Uovt. Resident, is kindly remembered in
Melbourne. Levey ousted him as exhibition
entrepreneur, and had in turn to give way to
Jimmy Thomson. Knight is embalmed in the
gorgeous bridecake model of his design for Parlia-
ment House, Melbourne, preserved in one of the
lobbies, feo far as it has gone, the existing front
is quite on his lines, but his grievance was that
marble had not been used. He thought the two
opposite Bourke-street corners should have been
t fc T a , rounding-off.” Knight used to be
laughed at for his extravagant design, but one’s
imagination must hark back to the era of 1856 or
' O‘Btuinas.sy laying the foundations
of the Chief Secretary’s Office, Treasury Gardens
on such a vast scale, estimated that by 1892 the
Victorian population would be six millions ! The
lomidations, after lying dead for many years
sufficed for all the Public Offices. Knight and
Charles Bright married two sisters, well-known in
oydney society. It is on record that Bright, as
leader of the Aegus staff—and brightest Yorick
conversationalist—was required to do a series of

verted.

A well-known writer some time ago sent
an Australian story to the brightest and si might
best weekly paper in America. The editor wrote
back : ‘ Your story I have read with interest and
pleasure, but we can’t print it, for the American
people don’t care a damn what happens in Aus-
traha. They don’t know Australia and don't
want to know it.” So much for the “ Federation
of the English-speaking races.” The Americans’
business is chiefly in America.
(< Never call your enemy “ a thiefcall him
‘ a damned thief,” and you will escape with small
damages. In London, recently, a man who
attended a meeting of creditors got so riled at
certain revelations that he called a solicitor “»
damned thief of a lawyer. This was just what
Ins costs-ship wanted and an action was entered for
slander. Mr. Justice Day directed the jury that
the words quoted were not actionable. “If (said
Mi. Justice Day) the solicitor had simply been
called a thief of a lawyer,’ it would have been
quite another affair, because the omission of the
word damned would have shown that the
defendant was not in a passion, but merely
abusive. ’ Of course, the solicitor appealed, but
the Master of the Rolls, Lord Justice Lopes and
Lord Justice Kay dismissed the appeal, and ruled
hat whereas thief ” was actionable, “damned
tmef would pass. This is cheering news to
Australians generally and a perfect throw-in for
Queenslanders.
The Mechanism of Man.
A man has within him a working pump called his
heart, a working bellows called his lungs, a work
lr *n 9 a^ ec l stomach, a workinsr condenser
called his brain, and a working evaporator called
his skin, all of which must be at work whether he
will or not. The heart is expending over his
body day by day, 122 foot-tons of work. He will
go on lifting so many millions of tons in so many
years. If he meet with no accident, the time
j , come . wh ® n his las t stroke will be finished
and he will die, or he may be carried off in
earlier hte by disease, which, however slight in
Its early stages, works like a ferment. The
symptoms may be scarcely noticeable—a little
laziness, slight headaches or, backaches—but
the cause is always at work. Take a handsome
rosy-cheeked young man, full of life and hope ; let
a germ of disease enter his system ; it is invisible,
too small to be weighed ; judged by the evidence
of the senses it is too insignificant to be thought
of, but it extends indefinitely. It may be months,
it may be years, but if the symptoms are neglected
the deadly disorder will do its tVal work; the
step loses its elasticity, the eyes become dull, the
cheeks pale, strength departs, and eventually the
joyous youth is but a shell, a cadaverous, shrunken
form, and death ends the dreadful scene. With
such facts staring us daily in the face how careful
ought we to be that the first warning voice of
nature should be heeded, and that when we suffer
those tired, aching feelings, those nervous head-
aches, neuralgia, and other signs of approaching
catastrophe we should have trust in that great
regenerator of vital strength Clements Tonic, which
positively restores pristine health to every organ
of the body, as instanced in the following case
In justice to the value of Clements Tonic 1 wish
to add my testimony to its efficacy. My daughter
has for several years been afflicted with torturing
headaches and complete prostration, for which
she tried numerous remedies to no purpose. At
length a friend sent her a bottle of Clements
Tonic, and a few doses gave such relief that she
will hear of no other remedy ; and other persons
in my household, who have been similarly afflicted,
have the same faith in its properties, W, E.
Murtagh, Mitta Mitta, Vic.” The above was
declared before me at Mitta Mitta, in the
Northern Bailiewick of Victoria, this 2nd day
of October, 1891, John Conway, J.P.

There are 21,276 plural votes in the

The Freetraders are already beginning
t 0 reahse that Geo. H. Reid is the round peg in
«P»ed ominously. The
Wornanhood Suffrage Bill is to be brought forth
in the Commons.
Ireland's population, per latest census, is
4 700162, consisting of 3,549,745 Catholics, and
1150 417 Protestants, &c.
’ T lle late N.S.W. “ Freetrade ” Parkes
Government collected six millions through the
Customs during their reign.
The rule in N.S. Wales seems to be-so

full of flaws that delegalise them.
Thp S A. railways return interest of 5’25

Premier Shiels (Vic.) intends to re-impose
duty on tea. Shiels is also going to retax the
» 1)0 o r man’s beer,” remitted by Sir Brine.
Goschen delivered lately, at Glasgow, a
lone address on British Colonial policy, in which
ho did not make a single reference to Australia.
How is it that Parkes’ henchmen, Dr.
Cullen M.L.A., and John Tannery Davies,
M.L.C., are so spiteful against Sir George Grey?
“ Should Gladstone return to office Lord
Carington will be Secretary of State for the
Colonies.” Downing-street will then be known as
Downy-street.
The Maoriland Government requests
Knutsford to submit to it the names of possible
successors to Governor Onslow. The Policeman
Blake episode again.
The customs duties, in West Australia.,
during 1889, amounted to £4 Os. 2d, per head of
the population. This province derives one-half its
revenue from the Customs !
Hon. Janies Service, M.L.0., Vic., thinks
“ the people of Victoria should be taught to rely
less on borrowed capital.” More : they should be
taught to do without it altogether, James.
Frank Oot'tqp, M.L.A. (N.S.W,), says
that protection renders honest government impos-
sible, and the incorruptible Parkes approves of
Cotton’s gospel. Tartuffe vouches for Catiline.
James R. Dickson, an ex-Treasurer of
Bananaland, having been to Hingland, has re-
canted his former loud-voiced professions respect-
ing white labour, and has publicly confessed him-
self a Kanaka apostate.
The Argus objects to Munro as an Agent-
General, on the ground that Victoria is just now
particularly in want of “ a capable man with an
Unimpeachable record to All the billet in
London. Nasty for James.
Knutsford says that, if Home Rule were
conceded to Ireland, “ the colonies would ask
themselves whether it was to their interest to
remain united with England.” Knutsford is
behind the times; the colonies are pondering that
very question now.
S.A. Parliament last year passed a
measure providing that all unclaimed moneys in
the banks over <£s should, after six years, be paid
into the Treasury and become the property of the
Crown. The local banks are determined to get
the measure repealed.
After taking elaborate pains to prove that
the Sovereign of England is a nonentity, Sydney
D. T. tenders its loyal compliment cautiously
thus: —“For a position of that kind the late
Duke of Clarence was not unfitted.” No; any
fool can till a sinecure.
There is little doubt that Sir John Hay,
President of the N.S.W. Legislative Council, who
is very ill, will never resume duty. Who is to be
the new President ? Parkes ? By the way, when
Sir Harry Atkinson went bung, he “accepted”
the M.L. Legislative Council Presidentship.
The Congress Committee recommendation
that £2,000,000 a year be spent for 10 years in
fortifying XJ.S. seaports against possible foreign
attack means that Canada may yet join the States
and that a navy and complete coast defence may
become necessary for the extended North Ameri-
can Republic.
On the motion of Lake, M.L.C. (S.A.), it
has been agreed by the West Australian Legisla-
tive Council that every person apparently under
the age of 16 years summarily convicted of any
offence of larceny, embezzlement, or aiding, &c.,
shall, in addition to, or in lieu of, any other
punishment, be flogged.
The Bundaberg (Q.) Star, praising the
new Italian imported-under-oast-iron-agreement
plantation laborers, says, “they have evidently
not been demoralised by mischievous agitators.
Any men who sweat themselves cheerfully in a
120 deg. sun {vide Star) for tuppence an hour,
can’t possibly be demoralised any further.
Munro was in Berry’s first Cabinet of
three mouths, Minister of Education, but was not
in Berry’s second Cabinet, of three years, which
James affectionately remembers now, in ousting
Berry as Agent-General. It is regarded as almost
certain that their confab will result in Berry
slipping in as Premier, after Shiels as warming-
pan.
Editor Hogue, of Sydney Evening News,
now personally takes part in politics. He
attended member Houghton’s meeting at the
Glebe and tried to “down” that politician with
questions. Brother Hogue had better lie low ;
he never can tell when the News may find it con-
venient to twist and double on its own political
tracks.
The great feature of the East Adelaide
election canvass is the way the women are working
for M’Pherson, the Labour leader. The meeting
in Adelaide Town Hall was visited by Mrs. Mary
Lee and a contingent of the Working Women’s
Trades Union, who were loudly cheered. M'Pher-
son is a rattling speaker and a clever politician,
who has been of enormous service to the Labour-
party.
Naturally enough, Premier Dibbs declined
himself in a false position, by openly pro-
mising the N.S.W. Trades and Labour Council
that Labour members should be nominated to the
Upper House; but he indicated that the fact of a
man being identified with Labour would not, as
heretofore, militate against the possibility of his
appointment. The Trades and Labour Council
should be content with this.
An offer is stated to have been made by an
“QUAFF, OH QUAFF THIS KIND NEPENTHE.”
TAILOR CREDITOR: “Hallo! I say, you drinking champagne? I can’t afford champagne,
though you owe me lots of money.
DEBTOR: “Ah! you see I drink to drown remembrance."
English syndicate to build a railway from Nor-
manton, Gulf of Carpentaria, to the terminal
point of the S. and W. line, with branches east-
wards to, the various seaports, for a total ot
£15,000,000. This is the brilliancy with which
the Coalition Government hope to dazzle to blind-
ness the Queensland electors, probably, -band-
grant, of course, and MTlwraithian.
An Argus correspondent remarks, in a
sorrowful tone of writing, that the defeated
Gladstonian candidate for East Dorset reduced
the hostile majority of 1880 by one-half, and adds
—“Certainly the Conservative managers ought
to look to the rural districts at once.” Just as it
they were not always looking to the rural districts
and tearing their hair over the discovery that
Hodge is not quite as complete an ass as he used
to be.
“Colonel” Smith, the member tor
Ballarat, has decided to stand by his bleeding
country, and offer himself for re-election. He
was enjoying broken health in Auckland when the
news reached him that Jimmy Munro was clear-
ing out and old friend Graham Berry coming
back. Whereupon the seasoned warrior got
better all at once, and went into training tor a
last final grab at the loaves and fishes.
Premier Dibbs said to a deputation the
other day that he “ didn't believe in Gladstone,
about whom there was ” (here Dibbs was thinking
of Gladstone’s obtrusive admirer, larkes) too
much of the artful dodger of politics. No one
will deny that there are some slight grounds for
this impudent imputation, which-recalls Babou-
chere’s remark: “I don’t mind Mr. Gladstone
having an ace up his sleeve, but I do resent his
constant assertion that God Almighty put it
there.” - ■ '
At the recent great Rural Conference, in
London (a prophetic sign of the coming triumph
of the Gladstonian party), “ not a single speech,
says the Daily Chronicle, “ was made that did
not breathe hatred, openly or by innuendo,
against the parson and the squire, as the two
great impenetrable obstacles to the amelioration
of life among the rural poor.” The parson and
the squire ! The self-imagined god and his vicar
of these rebellious yokels ! It is a revolution.
Victoria’s : 91 exports exceeded those of
>1)0 bv =£2,428,860; while her ’9l imports were less
than the imports of ’9O by =£1,331, 397. .N®™'
theless the exports were .£5,942,743 less than the
imports, the figures being : Imports, £21,622,600,
exports, £15,679,860. If exporting from pro-
tective Victoria keeps rising, and importing keeps
diminishing, it follows that the importer s occu-
pation will soon be gone, and that he will be cast
upon a cold, hard world. That’s why he dreads
Protection.
Parkes says he, “ like Peel,” was converted
by Cobden. Rubbish. As The Bulletin has
already pointed out, Peel was really converted by
the Irish famine—if a change necessitated by
expediency can be called a conversion. When ic
repealed the Corn Laws, Peel was forced to favour
Freetrade in general even though he probably am
not believe in it. The son of a Lancashire manm
facturer, he could not, as the resistance of Disraeli
afterwards proved, in a house of landlords injure
the protected agricultural interests while leaving
his own class untouched.
The “Freetrade” Sydney Daily Tele-
graph advocates the 66 encouragement ’ by tie
State of the agricultural industry by reducing the
railway freights for agricultural produce to a
nominal charge. The Bulletin does not object,
but it calls upon the D.T. to recant its I reetrade
faith, or else to have the political consistency to
ask that similar nominal railway rates shall be
charged for agricultural produce grown in Victoria
and Bananaland and imported into JN.Cs.w.
Vernon Harcourt once said. We are all
Socialists.” He might as truly have said We
are all-Protectionists.”
As was bound to be the case sooner or
later, respecting something or other, the Queens
land Government and the Queensland Civil-
Service Board have come into a deadlock collision.
The Under-sheriff died, and while the Civil-
Service Board has the nomination and supposed
appointment in its own power, the Minister for
Justice has in his hands the endorsement, without
which the appointment is not complete, ihe
Minister wanted to run up Chief Bailiff Galleyey,
but the board appointed C. P. b. Boyce. Ihe
Minister refuses to confirm the appointment—
and, at the time of writing, the trouble is at full
head.
Goldwin Smith, in delivering what he
declared would be his last political utterance from
a Canadian platform, spoke thus about Canada s
union with the United States ; •
The sand in my hour-glass is low ; and, before it quite
runs out, there are a few things gathered during a
student’s life which I should like, if I can, to put in shape.
Let my parting words be to urge you to look tacts steadily
in the face. Canada can afford to drift no longer.
Things may go on for a long time, but at last the inevit-
able will come, and it will not then be an equal and
honourable union ; it will be annexation indeed.
These pregnant sentences were aroused by the
rampant Amerioanophobia of Canadian and
British Jingoism.
Australia is sorry for the death of Prince
Albert Victor, because it is full of good-natured
people who always regret to hear that any father
and mother, even the veriest strangers, have lost
their son, or that any girl has lost her sweetheart.
But Australia has seen a cablegram stating that
LondJi Times “ regards the universal grief dis-
played in the colonies at the sad event, as witness-
ing the strength of the links of Empire, &0., and
it resents the effort made by the enemies of Aus-
tralian Nationalism to use, as political proofs and
arguments, the expressions of regret and sympathy
which, at best, can only be construed as the out-
come of civilized courtesy or diplomatic formality.
General bchaff, at the Episcopal church
Congress, Washington, U.S.A. : “What a glaring
lack of integrity our country is every day display-
ing here in Washington, stamping 80 cents worth
of silver with its great hand and calling it 10U,
and having the effrontery to say, ‘ln God we
trust. 5 ” This misses the real point. After all,
the act is performed by the nation for its own use
and recognition, and, if it is a national sin, it is
nationally paid for and nationally expiated, .but
apply a parallel argument to the private banks in
Australia permitted to issue paper I O Us that
are legal tender, in a proportion to bullion
altogether unwarranted by reasonable estimates
of solid solvency, and a vista is opened indeed of
monopolied power that is an audacious privilege
against democratic rights and possessions.
If G. H. Reid had any real democratic
grit, he would challenge the Dibbs Government
concerning their appointment of Scourger Glory
to the governorship of Deniliquin (N.S. W.) Gaol,
which is an outrage on the conscience of a tree
people. Is Reid too much of an official to see
that the Government argument that Ellory, being
a penal department official, is entitled to his pro-
motion like other warders of his own seniority, is
a sham ? Ellory was made a senior warder because
he agreed to flog. When he became scourger he
committed social suicide. In one hand he weighed
the emoluments of his position as Government
manflayer; in the other he held the social
ignominy which as an intelligent—we regret to
say Ellory is an intelligent man —he knew was
attached to the position. The Bulletin hopes to
see every self-respecting man in the_N.S.W. penal
department strike rather than remain in a, service
which gives effect to the shameful doctrine that
promotion depends on the performance of offices
disgusting to civilised man.
Buudaberg (Q.), is to be rechristened, it
appears. In some lingo or other, we forget which,
“bunda ss means “dog, 55 so let it be called
“Towzer.”
M.L.A. Crick has become a “sport” and
now owns a horse called the Snark. Memo, for
comp. : Snark, not shark.
The new Duke of Bedford, whose father
the second richest peer of the realm, committed
suicide just a year ago under singularly sensational
circumstances, has an absolute horror of being seen
by strangers; and always dines in solemn state at
midnight, though he is an unusually early riser.
When the Benvenue was wrecked recently
off Sandgate (Eng.) the captain died like a
philosopher of the olden time. About ten minutes
before the final crash he lit his pipe and sat down
peacefully in his cabin, and when the ship broke
in two and went down he went with her, smoking
tranquilly to the last. And now he is a skeleton
with a pipe at the bottom of the English Channel,
and he and his unfinished smoke drift about
together amid the seaweed and the sands.
When Babylon went down two per cent,
of her people owned her entire wealth. When
Persia went down one per cent, of her population
owned all of her wealth. When Rome went down
one thousand eight hundred men owned and con
trolled the known world. In 1800, sixty-three
and one-half per cent, of the people owned the
entire wealth of the U.S. In 1870, thirty-seven
per cent, of the people owned the entire wealth of
the U.S. In 1890, twenty per cent, of the people
owned the entire wealth of the States.
Sydney Mobnino Hebald says of Albert
Victor, deceased :
Happily for all, the young Prince has left behind him
the record of a blameless youth ; and notwithstanding
the fierce light that heals upon a throne and everyone
surrounding it, there has not been a scandal or even 11’-
report to sully his memory.
Thus is history made ! The Herald here reminds
us of the Gbaphic, which, in printing a life of
Albert Edward, left out the Mordaunt and bacca-
rat incidents.
The alleged “ Dora-Dora blacks,” who are
wanted for a murder committed something like a
year ago in Victoria, still crop up occasionally in
the papers. The police have never once seen
them, but they have followed the tracks of four
naked feet right through Victoria and across more
than half N.S. Wales, and how often they have
lost the original feet and picked up a fresh set no
one knows. The only man who saw the two
indubitable niggers—the ones with the trade-mark
on them and the name blown in the buttle—-is
dead months ago, owing to a spear in his back;
and if the police ever capture the pair—or any
other pair—they must either let them go again or
hang them without evidence. If they meant to
let them go, then we presume they wouldn’t run
after them, so evidently they intend to hang
them, anyhow. According to latest advices,
the missing heathens were near Tamworth.
from which it is conjectured that they
must have fled down Oxford-street, Sydney,
and across Gebrge-street, and made for the north
by running over the wastes of Pyrmont and
Five Dock, or else they came in by train on an
aboriginal pass, blindly granted by some Govern-
ment official down south, and escaped by omnibus
from Redfern. The telegram further states that
in one day they ran 50 miles over mountains,
rivers, and fences, with the police a good second,
and the proceedings closed as usual with the
niggers one mile ahead. They always are ahead,
and the way the chase will end is a foregone con-
clusion. The two blackfellows will scoot right
ahead till they go round the world, and as they
are doing their second lap, they will come up on
the police still engaged on their first one, and
will run over them and break their backs. This
is the only real danger of the case, and the officers
are hereby enjoined to keep a bright look-out
behind.

LIFE OF C. S. PARNELL,
By T. P. O’CONNOR, M.P.
Price (post jree), Is. fid.
“ Mr. O’Connor has certainly surpassed himself in the
writing of this intensely interesting work. ... No
newspaper notice, however full, can give any adequate
impression of the career as is here depicted of the great
Irishman who has gone. Mr. O’Connor’s hook itself should
be in the hands of everyone who is interested in the
brilliant and stormy career which is ended for ever. . .
A delightful, graphic and biographical sketch of one of
the most remarkable figures of the century.”—Dublin

Two absolute essentials for the existence
of the human race are—land and air. Many
economic and political systems have been invented
and are advocated for obtaining land for each,
individual to live upon, but it has been loft to the
Hydraulic Cooling and Ventilating Co. to intro-
duce pure air into every habitation in Australia,
by means of their “Perfection” Cooler and
Ventilator. By attaching this machine to your
water supply or tank, and simply turning on the
tap, a constant stream of pure, fresh air can be
obtained in any chamber you desire. Punkahs
are thus superseded, perishable goods can be kept
at a small expense without ice, and you can enjoy
the luxury of a cool chamber on the hottest day or
night. The machine, which is simplicity itself,
work's at the cost of one half-penny per day, while
the price brings it within the reach of most.
Send for particulars or inspect the machines work-
ing in our offices. T. A’. Knight and Co., St.

Society
Loyalty is the art of lying over dead
princes.
* * *
When do the bad dead princes die 1 We
have read the obituaries of a good many, and
apparently the Lord wasn’t a patch on any one of
them.
* * #
Thus the cable: “Cardinal Manning, when
dying, exclaimed ‘ Thank God ’ on being told that
the Duke of Clarerjce was slightly better.” Now,
why did the dying man say merely “ Thank God?”
Because the Duke was only slightly better ? No!
because it was the last time that he’d hear any-
thing said about a Duke. Were we within three
gasps of eternity we should have felt and said
just the same.
Not that we believe Manning said any-
thing of the sort attributed to him. It is too late
in the day to make us swallow as gospel any more
of the “ last words ” of great men.
The N.S.W. Ministers were content to
present their humble duty to Queen Victoria in
regard to the death of the Duke of Clarence. The
Mayor of Sydney, however, went one better. He,
according to the papers, presented his humblest
duty.
• • »
It was a ’cute thing for the Victorian
Ministry to appoint Sunday as a day of mourning
for the Duke of Clarence. The Munro, from
Aberdeen awa’ or thereaboots, merely remarked ;
“In the meedst o’ life we are in death, but it
inus’na’cut into beesness.”
# # •
In an editorial, Sydney D.T., speaking of
the deceased Duke of Clarence, printed “ he ”
with a capital H. Perhaps it was the sarcastic
comp. The S.M. Herald and Echo were the
only Sydney papers to “ turn ” their column-rules
(he., go into mourning); the Herald turned them
inside its sheet, and the Echo only turned them
amongst its outer advertisements. The latter
fact wants thinking over.
• * #
The S.M. Herald has astounded its
solemn readers by the publication of Mr. Henry
Lucy’s jibing article on the betrothal of the
Duke of Clarence and Princess May in the same
issue in which it wails over the death of the
former.
* * *
The Herald, which in one place allows
Mr. Lucy to speak most contemptuously of the
deceased Duke, becomes in another absolutely
maudlin over his bier. Here is a cablegram from
its “London Correspondent :
The condition of Princess Victoria of Teck causes great;
anxiety to her family. She clings to the body of the
Duke of Clarence, calling, “O, Eddie, Eddie! speak to
me.” The efforts of her relatives to calm her trrief are
unavailing.
This is very pathetic—also very improbable.
There is a good deal of rigid etiquette about the
remains of dead royalties, and even when the
relatives of the deceased become hysterical and
scream over his dust they seldom scream loud
enough for a Herald correspondent to hear them.
However, the clerical journalist loses his sense of
probability through living too much on Jonah
and the whale and little yams like that.
* * #
Mrs. Julian Ashton is considering a sug-

the gate, paid the shilling, and saved the six-

The new Mayor of Hobart (Reynolds by
name) distinguished himself greatly at the opening
of the Science Congress meeting at Hobart. His
Right Worshipful Nibs was supposed to say just
a few words of welcome to the wise men who had
come from afar—but he was not going to be done
out of his little show. Accordingly he proceeded
to deliver a mayoral address on astronomy, in
which he gave the great men representing that
particular section a hard nut to crack by evolving
a theory that the world was all inside and no out-
side. The audience took the thing pretty good
humouredly and roared with laughter until he
quietly shut up.

Old Baron Von Mueller scored off the
Dean of Hobart at the Science Congress at Hobart.
Rev. Dundas, who is a very fightable parson,
wrote to the secretary of Congress, asking by
what right a “dissenting ” parson, named Clarke,
had been told off to preach the science sermon.
Simultaneously with the Dean’s note came another
growl from the R.C. bishop. To smooth matters
down, it was arranged that the three loving
Christian brothers should each have his say. Just
when matters were pretty well settled, the dry,
old Baron looked blearingly over his spectacles
and said, “ Shentlemen!—shentlemen! de matter

a view to breaking-up the story in question that
the return was called for.

When ex-Premier Munro goes to London
as Agent-General for Victoria he will presently
be made a K.0.M.G., for it has become almost a
fixed tradition that every Agent-General must
have a title. Then his exemplary wife will
naturally become Lady Munro. And then when,
the Melbourne papers report that “Lady
Munro” (another Lady Munro, you know) “ was
fined 10s. for being drunk and using violent
language ” a great many ignorant people will get
a totally erroneous idea, and the London papers
will report regretfully that the Agent-General’s
wife has gone on a tear. Munro had better con-
sider this difficulty before he takes his title.

The eccentric parson who bought the
Model Prison at Port Arthur when it was put up
for sale by the Tasmanian Government, makes a
good thing out of the excursionists who flock to
the “ old settlement ” in the summer, charging a
shilling a head for admission to the interior of
the “relic.” The other day a large party of
visitors from the mainland grudgingly parted
with their money only to find the chief attraction
—the model chapel—closed against them.

It is not generally known that the present
dilapidated condition of the old prison buildings
at Port Arthur is due to the pilfering propensi-

stripped the roofs of the buildings of the immense
quantity of lead that rendered them water-tight
and smuggled it to Hobart with the aid of con-
federates.

Dear Bulletin, — In a paragraph, you say :
“ Complaints are again made that well-paid
officers in the N.S.W. Civil Service lend money at
Hebraic interest to their impecunious subor-
dinates. Ministers should see to this.” It is
well known in the Service that it is often an
invidious task for Ministers to interfere. For
instance, in the Telegraph Department one high-
placed functionary lends at the rate of 2s. per
month oh every <£l—that is, 120 per cent. He
prosecutes business with impunity, for he he Ids
two of his few superiors as security for the safety
of his position. It is hard to call on a “boss”
to wriggle from under the thumb of a junior
“ boss ” and give evidence before the Minister. If
a Civil Service magnate can’t move and think and
speak cum dignitate, he sinks into a mere nonen-
tity, and Ministers have always to bear this in
mind. The boss of 20 years’ standing is as
unapproachable as the Czar. —J.M.

delicately suggested that perhaps the other artist
had better stop rubbing, because he was only

"ILL-FATED CLARENCE."
An Heir Presumptive to a throne
Has given up the ghost,
To few of us his face was known,
His name, maybe, to most.
The lying Press in print has wept
And sighed like anything;
We’ve nothing sad to say, except—
He might have been a king.
The Heir Apparent’s eldest son 1
And what was he beside ?
His “ greatness,” with his birth begun,
Was ended as he died.
No special sorrow wrung our hearts
When Clarence passed away,
For men who play more useful parts
Are dying every day,
And working hard on every hand
To earn a pittance mean
Until they reach the Better Land
Which hasn’t got a queen ;
And they, when ’tis their turn to go.
From loving arms are torn.
And grief is in their homes, although
The Nation doesn't mourn.
The Nation Mourns —a canting phrase.
What trouble we, or you,
When princes die ? Let liars praise
The good they didn’t do.
We cannot weep, we do not laugh,
We smoke a pipe and sing
This harmless, honest epitaph—
"He might have been—a king.”
THE BEST WE EVER HAD.
The Baron’s nose is out of joint;
That smart, retired rake
Is not the man to whom we point
As holder of the cake.
Although he always seemed so nice
And tried to play the Rad,
The new one is, to be precise,
The best we ever had.
Preetrade adores him hugely, and
Protection loves him much—
With every creature in the land
The Jarsey is in touch :
He smiles upon the squattah proud
And on the lowly cad,
Till both together cry aloud—
“ The best we ever had !”
He goeth in for Simple joys
With simple, noble Zest,
lie hasn’t sent a batch of boys
To find eternal rest ;
lie sits his Sunday sermon out
And never seemeth sad—
lie really is, without a doubt,
The best we ever had.
Great Carington, thy very name
If half-forgotten now,
Thy laurel wreath of Sydney fame
Has withered on thy brow.
Although we sometimes hear it said
“ The other wasn’t bad,"
The Earl who reigneth in thy stead
Is—best we ever had.
To win renown, we must confess,
Is easy for the “ swell ” ;
A Gov. achieves a great success
By doing nothing—well,
And whilst our Jersey doesn’t make
Us very sick or mad,
He shall be called, and no mistake,
The. best we ever had,
HIS RUBBER.
Dear Gordon, let the maiden have her cash,
And do not snub her ;
Although the love of art has made you rash,
Don't sigh or blubber ;
In days when you were feeling low and ill
You wouldn’t take a plain, plebeian pill,
But said, “ I’ll try, yea, cdute qui Coutts it will,
A quiet rubber.”
She rubbed you, with her left and with her right,
Around the liver ;
Of new and strange sensations of delight
She proved the giver ;
She banished all your little aches and pains,
You dreamed of singing birds and shady lanes,
The while the blood was rushing through your veins
Just like a river.
But whilst the maid was “kneading” with a will,
You noticed, sonny,
She also needed more to pay her bill—
Heigho 1 more money ;
She rubbed in glowing'.health at every pore,
But now there comes the rub that is a bore—
’Tis you who must be rubbing off the score.
Old man, it’s funny.

The local undertaker at
Oampbelltown (N.S.W.) lately
had a sensational advertisement.
His horses were newly-broken
colts, and after a fortnight’s
spell on rich pasturage they
were hitched up to the hearse
to do “the sober, steadfast,
and demure” gait of funeral
decorum. Soon after the cortege
started they shied and bolted,
dashed past the cemetery at a
hand-gallop, and careered along
the country - road for another
mile ere being pulled up. Every
morning since their owner has
galloped them for ten miles so
as to keep them “ stiff.” The
moral is that any aspirant for
undertaking honours should in-
vest in decrepit ’bus-horses. To
the overworked and knock-
kneed steed the cemetery-road
is the flowery path, and a
horse’s gratitude is all the
gratitude an undertaker can
hope for in this life.

Frock and bonnet items are beginning to

their hair, to abjure kid gloves, high sleeves,
oxidised buttons and sich, and to heave their high-
heeled shoes at the devil, and, if possible, to land
him in the eye. Then she finishes with this very
practical remark: “I advise our women not to
wear their skirts so short in the front, as we have
to stand on high platforms, and it is hardly
modest. (Mem. here for habitues of the grand-
stand at Randwick races). The dress-skirt should
reach quite down to the feet, below the ankle. If
too long for the march in wet weather, it could
easily be drawn up a little.” Now we know why
the bald-headed convert always makes for the
front seat.

When the African goes in for style there
is no white swell on earth who can compare with
him. The other day a “cullud pusson” of the
gorgeous variety was dining in a Melbourne hotel.
He had a tall, shiny hat which he hung up on a
peg, huge collar and cuffs, and diamond studs,
and he shone like a garish beetle in the sunlight.
The waiter brought him ham and eggs, but he
only regarded them with a fastidious eye, and
then sent them away. He sent away the chops
too, and when some steak came along he decided
that it wasn’t good enough, and fired it out also.
.Then a big bagman sitting at the other side of the
table suddenly raised his stentorian voice and
spoke: “Waiter, be good enough to get a possum
for this darned blackfellow.” There was peace
after that, and the “cullud gentleman” ate any-
thing that came along.
The mad king of Bavaria has got a new
inspiration; at latest advices he considered him-
self a stork. He has constructed a huge nest in
one of the apartments of his palace of Furstenried,
every stick and straw of which he gathered up out
of the dirt with his mouth and fetched along in
his teeth. And now he sits in his nest most of
the day with feathers stuck in his long, thick hair
and beard, and makes strange clattering sounds
when anybody comes near him. On other
occasions he stands on one leg gazing with a
vacant eye at the air in front of him. At these
times he is very like a stork, which is a stupid
and drunken-looking bird that could pass, on a
back view, for a bald hunchback on one leg hold-
ing on to the tails of a dress-coat. When Otto is
balanced on one foot, with the feathers in his
unkempt head, he is every inch a king—and a
stork, which is much the same thing.
Some years ago the s.s. Wellington was
running between Auckland and Whangaroa (M. L.)
with a large assortment of passengers—chiefly
bagmen. Every second man aboard a Maoriland
steamer is a bagman, and the man in between is
generally a preacher. There was a glaring Hebrew
drummer among the crowd, and when the vessel
got out of Whangaroa he sidled up to the captain
and volunteered to take the wheel as far as the
next port, three hours distant. He said that in
his youth he had been a seaman by profession,
which, considering his nose, seemed an eminently
improbable statement, but the captain accepted
the statement and put him on the stern-wheel.
The other bagmen gathered round to watch
the proceedings. It was a hot day, and pre-
sently the corpulent Israelite at the wheel began
to perspire and breathe heavily. The vessel
evidently wanted a lot of steering ; every minute
the captain called to the suffering bagman to put
her “ hard-a-port,” and the Hebraic one would
whiz the wheel round and stand on the spokes to
steady her, and then before he could wipe the
perspiration from his smoking head there would
be another cry of “ hard-a-starboard,” and the
implement would be rushed over again, and the
steersman would hold it down with his hands and
both feet, and puff despairingly. If the bag-
man’s hat got down over his eyes, or if he wanted
to sneeze, the captain at that very moment
would invariably yell at him|like a tornado, and
make him throw himself on the wheel like a
Hebrew possessed. At first he tried to wear an
air of joint proprietorship in the boat, but pre-
sently that faded away, and he became dejected,
limp, and crushed-looking. Still he hung on for
three weary hours till the next port was in sight,
and then he feebly asked to Jbe relieved “as he
wanted to get his things together.” “ Oh, it’s all
right,” said the captain, blandly. “You can let
go. In fact, the wheel’s out of gear—has been
out of gear all the afternoon. There’s another
man steering in the wheelhouse on the bridge.”
“ What!” “Yes, didn’t you know it ? I thought
you were only amusing yourself, so I kept holler-
ing orders to you to make it look real, you know.”
And then the Hebrew rose up suddenly, and
made remarks. He has been known on the
Maoriland coast as “The Steersman ” ever since.

didn’t suit—
And, therefore, they were qualified to join the Institute.
They wore big corporations, and they toyed with choice
cigars,
And looked a lot superior to the men who dealt in pars.—
But all the crowd was merry, and the wit was pretty fair.
And Dow was highly honoured when they put him in the
chair. •
He didn’t strike one forcibly as quite the J. L. Dow
Who’d gone before the City Court—you all remember how;
He yarned and laughed and tippled, and he very nearly
sang;
He joked about his trouble with the Gourlay grabbing
gang. .»
The speeches were explanatory, likewise they were brief,
A fact in which no pressman could see any cause for
grief—
Macdonald spoke a speaklet with his index finger spread,
And all felt “ elevated ” by the things that Tipping said.
Then Robinson—a party who had left the noble Press
For a clerkship up in Parliament—delivered an address,
He said, “ ’Tis forty centuries since I began the game,
But still I’ll move the motion that is standing in my
name."
And Edmund Mitchell seconded ; he wished, he said, to
keep
Acquaintance with some people who were not absorbed in
sheep ;
And Morgan, from the lair of Syme, his acquiescence lent,
And Melvin, of the Telegraph, most kindly did assent.
And then a sub-committee was proposed by Harry Short,
To wrestle with the rules and to bring up a big report,
And when they’d had a toast or two, why Lambie played
the flute—
And thus did eighty scribes inaugurate an Institute.

The Advertiser has in his possession a copy of Dr.
M. A. Simmons’ world-famed receipt, the greatest
RECUPERATIVE and TONIC medicine the world
has ever known. Since the doctor’s decease the owner
has prescribed it and given it to some hundreds of
people in Australasia, and now to save the trouble of
frequent written applications for the same, he has had
it printed, and will send a copy to anyone desiring it on
receipt of a 6d. in stamps and a self-addressed envelope.
One quart of the medicine can be made at a cost not
exceeding 2s. (id., sufficient for ,a two week’s course.
To show you how valuable are the medicinal properties
of this compound, I may say that it contains eight
ingredients, and among the number will be found
HOPS, DANDELION, and Bib HP.
TO THE POOR.—On receipt of clergyman’s certificate
that they are unable to pay, it WILL BE SENT FREE.
It is Invaluable to old or young of either sex, and has
cured thousands when abandoned by doctors and
friends. If you suffer from any of the under-mentioned
diseases, such as IMPURE BLOOD, LOSS of- APPE-
TITE, INDIGESTION, ENLARGED LIVER, SHORT-
NESS OP BREATH, WEAK LUNGS, PALPITATION
of the HEART, PAINS in the small of the BACK,
indicating that the KIDNEYS are affected, write
for it. Have you loss of energy and feel, all the day
tired out, tongue coated and furred, breath bad, urine
high colored or scanty, at other times profuse ? Then
it is your DUTY to write for it. Eor the gentle sex it is
a perfect blessing for the relief of the many ills they arc
subject to, and if your skin is covered with BLOTCHES
and PIMPLES it will cure you like magic, please bear
this in mind, it is a PURELY HERBAL PRESCRIP-
TION, not a grain of any other drug in it.

SPORTING NOTIONS.
■ Supposing AJ.S.W. had beaten South Australia
in the recent cricket-match, South Australia having
beaten Victoria by one innings, and Victoria having
beaten N.S.W. by six wickets, which province would have
been entitled to the premiership ?
# # »
Grace’s ’92 Australian average is, at the time of
writing, 48 for 14 innings, top of the English list. His
159 not out against Victoria, of course, assisted materially.
Phillipson, with only 6 innings, is second with 26. Then
come the three pro.’s, Lohmann (25), Maurice Read (23),
Peel (23), followed by Stoddart, who has only made one
big score.
* # »
The financial divide, amid all hands, over the
last Melbourne cricket-match, England v. Australia, was
the biggest known in cricket annals.
« • •
The Englishmen are pretty careful of their boss
bowlers. Every member of the team, bar M’Gregor, has
been allowed to try his hand in one or other of the
matches against sixteen or twenty-two. Bean and
Maurice Read went on as a “ double change ” during the
second innings of East Melbourne, the other day, and the
Surrey slogger actually made an average of one wicket
for six runs.
* * *
Talk about W. G, Grace’s ill manners after his
team’s defeat in the test cricket match 1 You should just
have seen Lord Sheffield !
* # *
Conynghame should have a show in international
matches, as Queensland, possessing a player of his merit,
should undoubtedly' be represented.
* * *
Ned Gregory’s old horse is, perhaps, the
most knowing quadruped under the sun. In the recent
interprovincial cricket match, when the ground was being
rolled after the first innings, the old horse stopped mid-
way between the wickets, winked at Ned and neighed ;
and Ned will take his oath that neigh was horse-talk for
“ I hope Moulton comes off in the second innings.”
* # #
Prof. Miller wants to fight Joe Goddard. Miller
is apparently tired of life.
* * #
The Sydney Amateur Gymnastic Club, like the
London Pelican, has collapsed. Larry Foley’s Olympic
meanwhile flourishes.
* • * *
Last week Charley Dunn, well-known both as a
ped. and pug., though Nature has not given him a good
shape for either job, met Tom Taylor, the blacksmith,
who also teaches the young idea how to shoot the left
and cross with the right, at Sydney Olympic Club- the
old Gaiety Theatre. Dunn, a short man, with extra-
ordinary development of back, chest and shoulders,
adopted a crouching attitude, and should have fallen an
easy prey to Taylor, who stood well up to his man. In
the first round Taylor had all the best of it, but seemed
nervous, another proof of the old theory that, except in
Irish faction fights, red-headed men are “soft.” In the
second round Dunn managed to close and put in some
heavy blows, which completely nonplussed Taylor, who
became dazed. Nothing but the call of time saved him,
and he went out early in the third round.
* * #
A Sydney crowd compared with a Melbourne
ditto is as a raging lion to a tame rabbit. Any row on
the M. C. C. ground is out of the question nowadays.
The people down South are so orderly and highly
governed that if they paid to see a cricket-match and the
cricket didn’t appear they would simply heave a gentle
sigh and slink off, one at a time. Nobody ever saw' a
Melbourne man try to work up a demonstration in a
drizzling rain, or stand up for what he considered his
rights when the wind was blow ing from the North, and in
fine, cool weather he hesitates to assert himself in a
public place for fear of being suddenly removed on a
charge of insulting behaviour. The strange influence of
the Murray in effecting social distinctions must not be
overlooked when the Federation question next crops up.
* # *
Larry Foley will fight Professor Price, of Mel-
bourne, or any other man on earth, with singlesticks, for
as much money as he likes.
* * #
Grace came out to field substitute for Callaway
in the international match, when the Englishmen were
batting for the last time, and at once began to arrange
the home team. The joke was taken in good part, and
reminded one of paterfamilias joining in the cricket-
match between his own kids and those next door, and
telling both what to do. When Callaway re-appeared,
Grace shook him warmly by the hand, and doubled back
to the pavilion, amid general applause. Grace and
Callaway, by the way, were frequently chatting together
on the field during the match.
* # *
The Victorian Cricket Association has decided
that Dr. Barrett’s reason (“ that he went to bed ill on
Tuesday and didn’t get up until the following Monday”)
for not playing in the recent match Victoria v. N.S. Wales,
iS unsatisfactory, and it has been decided not to select
the Doctor any more this year.
Dear Bulletin, —Slavin’s evasion of Jackson’s
challenge indicates to me that he has not forgotten that
little turn-up in Foley’s bar a few years ago. The mob
cry for Slavin, but 1 have all along—unlike other scribes—
held the opinion that should Peter eschew Masonic
junketting and bar-room work he’ll win, not too quickly,
yet easily. Sullivan’s panther-like rushes, were he at his
best, might break down Peter’s guard, but Slavin is too
slow. The history of thel’.R. proves that a quick, straight
left can always overcome a smashing right.—V.
* # *
, Steve O’Donnell, the most skilful of Sydney’s
big boxers, seemingly does not care to see his name in
print, especially in connection with the gloves. The
papers speak of him as an amateur. When he used to
attend Foley’s White Horse some five years ago, there
seemed to be little of the amateur about him.
WITH COLOURED SAILS.
As the National Regatta Committee considered that
coloured sails in yachting would make the pace too fast,
they excluded them from taking part in the National
Regatta, which led to the coloured sails getting up their
own regatta, and inviting the sailing world of Sydney to
enter in their contests the result being that nearly
the whole boat-racing world responded to the call in
sympathy with the coloured club. On Monday the entries
were 83 boats, truly a great, fleet and the pick of Austra-
lian sailing men. The coloured-sail people threaten to
knock the end out of the National Regatta.

Gentlemen,
I send you a photograph
of our ‘ twin ’ baby girls, taken
on their first birthday, Novem-
ber nth. From birth they have
been fed entirely on your Malted
Food, and from being poor, frail
little mortals, whose lives were
despaired of, they have thriven
and become quite chubby and
jolly little specimens of baby-
hood. Moreover, so far, they
have been entirely free from
illness of any sort. I ought to
say your food was recommended
us by ourfamily doctor. Kindly
post us the photographs back at
your convenience.
Yours very faithfully,
(Signed), JAS. WALTER.

Ex-bobby Bally whack, of a glorious little
agricultural town down South, doesn’t depend for
his existence on his neat little police-pension, but
parades around various streets every Monday
morning, for his rents. He was a good policeman
and he prospered. He is still a very good man
and he goes around with the plate at his church
every Sunday. But he recently had a “ bit uv a
differ ” with one of his tenants, a charming young
widow who might yet be changing her late hus-
band’s name, and he evicted her out of one of his
shops, after two months’ hard manoeuvring, she
was such a divil! After that, whenever he used
to carry round the plate on Sundays, and approach
her seat, instead of dropping in the regulation
thrippenny bit, she would start “keening” in a
loud tone —the witch ! —“Ochone! An’ ter think
such a howly, swate-looking, saintly ould man wud
tur-r-n out uv house an’ home a poor, lone widdy, the
loike of me !” He stood it for some Sundays, but
at last had to swop plates with the man in the
other aisle, or gangway, or whatever you call
it. Ballywhack had a mate —or had had one,
we should say, for the like of him would not
speak to the like of this one now —named Hooley,
who had been in the foorce along with him, but
Hooley was quite a different kind of a bird.
While Ballywhack would be always investing in
terraces —that’s the stock saying, you know, but
it was in allotments, in this case—Hooley would
always be stone-broke, with his month’s screw
mortgaged two months beforehand, you under-
stand. He, too, is now retired, but he
is still stone - broke. His principal source
of income is the giving of advice to litigants; he
takes his fees in beer. Ooh ! but he’s the merry
soul! Once, when he was on active “ jooty,” he
went of a Sunday into a pub. to join a dozen or so
friends in a surreptitious delight. Now, the
Inspector had been a mspector of Hooley for a
long time, and happened to “obsarve” him go
into this very house on this occasion. So the
Inspector cunningly waited till he thought the
glasses were all filled, and then he made a rush.
But the boys had heard, him, and every man
pocketed his glass straight away, while Hooley
drew his baton and laid around him right and left,
singing out: “Will yez, ye shpalpeens, disgrace
yer howly religion!” When the Inspector
appeared they all became quiet, and Hooley said :
“It’s all roight, sorr ; ye’re just too }ate, sorr ; the
wretches shtarted a foight over religion, sorr, but
Oi quoitened ’em I”

Ayer’s Sarsaparilla
I > everywhere recommended as the best rem-
edy lor the cure of scrofula, scrofulous and
cancerous humors, chronic catarrh, eczema
boils, pimples, sores, and all disorders origina
tins in impure blood. It neutralizes and elimi
nates the acids, that cause' rheumatism, gout
and dropsy. It regulates the liver and kidneys
gives tone to the stomach, increases the appe
life, aids digestion,
Cures Dyspepsia,
and makes the weak strong. No other blood
purifier is composed of such carefully selected
highly concentrated, and skilfully united in-
gredients. For nearly half a century this prep-
aration has. in both hemispheres, been the
standard tonic and strengthening medicine. It
is universally approved by the medical profes-
sion, and benefits the enfeebled system at all

This, remarks Gertrude Frances Atherton, con*
sidering that
California is but 45 years old, is a big stride out of bar-
naiism, particularly when one thinks of the mellow-and
rotten—countries left in the rear. What will be the
result when women get the bit fairly between their teeth
is unsafe of prediction. That in time it will alter the very
features on the face of the earth can hardly be doubted.
Hie moral code will be the first to feel the strain, snap,
and then go over to the dust-heap. Women having the
refinement of centuries in their blood will never care to
adopt the utmost license of men, but they will
arrange their lives to please themselves, and if

rights of children—which is always the first argument to
ring up so many will not occur, and the law will attend
to them as soon as they do. Let every child when born,

Whereas, I suffered very severely from a very
troublesome affection of the Nerves, which affected me so
much that I was quite unable to attend to my business —
that of a Merchant Tailor. I tried several Doctors and
many Remedies, but all of no avail. Whereas, I, as a
last hope obtained some of Herr Rassmussen’s
PURELY HERBAL “ DENMARK UNI-

sincerely declare COMPLETELY CURED ME within a

have remained well ever since.
The DENMARK UNIVERSAL PILLS also cured
my wife, and I make this solemn declaration, conscientiously

On the Lachlan river, N.S.W., many

A new process of debts recovery is now in
full swing in Bananaland, and the fierce-eyed
creditor rejoiceth exceedingly. The court, after
due forms have been observed, simply attaches
the debtor’s wages, as it thinks fit. The counter-
move to this is, of course, for a debtor to get-some
trusty friend to secure the first attachment of
wages on a t bogus debt, and then, when the real
creditors came on the scene, the court could not
go behind its own previous order, and the creditor
would have to fall back on his old-time remedy of
going outside to curse *and to glare. This is,
therefore, really an improvement on the old style,
as Jeremy Diddler would get the protection of the
court against his creditors, and its innocent con-
nivance with his cheerful plan of never paying
anybody.
London Daily Chronicle has been run-
ning a silly-season column on “ Marriageable
Women,” and the gifted correspondent, beneath
whose letter occurs the editorial rat-trap-snap,
“this correspondence must now cease,” was the
only one for whom it was worth prolonging. She
—there is internal evidence of the “seek”—pro-
poses that a Marriage Tontine Society should be
formed for the endowment of women on mar-
riage.” All that girls would have to do would be
to pay up entrance-fees and keep up their yearly
subscriptions—a sort of insurance-society, in
which marriage takes the place of death, with the
added luck-chance that the past fees of all mem-
bers who die spinsters, or “ grow out,” are
swallowed up into the general fund further, the
marriages must take place between stated ages,
but that is of no consequence, because a maiden
never gets over 30 years old. This, with the
“ dot ” system, and a marriage bureau as a
relieving side-show, ought to work off the unsale-
able English girls whose representatives have been
weeping in the D.C. Mormonism is said to be
dead, and the Turkish harems are over-womanned.
Dear Bulletin,— Re dispute as to eels
being in Riverina waters, allow me to say what 1
know. About 12 years ago a heavy rain fell at
Deniliquin after a long drought. All the lagoon
beds along the Edwards river were full of dead
gum-leaves and the rain washed these into the
river, which, in a few days, become as black as ink.
The change in the river water evidently didn’t
agree with its inhabitants, for the “yabbys”and
turtles took to the banks en masse while the fish—
Murray cod, perch and bream—being unable to
follow their example quietly turned over and died
in hundreds. Along the sandbanks I saw
thousands of little eels, all about four inches long,
lying dead in heaps mixed up with shrimps and
water insects, for whom likewise the gum leaves
were too much. As I have stated all these eels
were of a uniform size and very small. I never
saw any bigger eels than these in the Edwards
and I think all fish usually found in Riverina
waters find their way into the Edwards, which is
a branch of the Murray. If anything would have
made big eels show themselves—if they existed in
the Edwards—the gum-leaves would have done so,
for even the water-rats deserted the river until it
got clean again.—H. 8., Sydney, Jan. 16, 1892.

RUBBISH BOXES.
The subject may seem an unfragrant one to dis-
course about, but, nevertheless, it opens up ground
for investigation. Dust-boxes are not so utterly
destitute of instructive lessons as one might
suppose. They are largely patronised by the
übiquitous goat and the predatory, homeless
mongrel, who overhaul their varied contents in
the grey dawn. It is an interesting sight to
observe a pensive ruminant enjoying a hearty
breakfast off an empty jam-tin, or the remains of
a wornout bonnet, fished up from the depths of a
dust-box, and then trotting merrily homeward to
supply some family with the result of its repast in
the shape of milk.
Dust-boxes have a language of their own. An
inspection of their contents, for instance, will tell
the tale of frugality or extravagance on the part
of the house-keeper whose back fence they adorn.
Observant landlords are taught by them, and
permit no arrears of rent to accumulate where the
rubbish-bins display too many glass monuments,
recognised by the initiated as “dead marines.”
The thousands of dozens of bottles which once
contained fluids of various brands, and that find
their way into the dust-boxes of rich and poor
alike, might be worked up as a subject for an
interesting temperance lecture. More interesting
still would it be to note the large number of care-
fully drained phials bearing the well-known St.
Jacobs Oil label that find a similar destination.
An enormous percentage of Australian homes are
never without it, and in the remainder it is either
borrowed from a neighbour when occasion requires
or the patient has to suffer on. Everybody who
has tried it, or who knows anyone else that has,
declares that as an external remedy for pain St.
Jacobs Oil is pre-eminently the most efficacious in
the world.

A POPULAR MISTAKE.
Many people have an idea that the Waterbury,
because a cheap watch, is therefore cheaply made.
A visit to the company’s factory, at Waterbury,
Conn., would decidedly alter this impression._ On
seeing the extent and variety of the machinery
used, and the neatness, order, and organisation
there exhibited, you begin to realise that making
a cheap Watch (and a good one) is not by any
means the off-hand affair you had thought it was.
As you pass thtough department after department
and observe the workihg of wonderful automatic
machines, which make parts so fine you can
scarcely see them, and yet so accurate that they
can be" taken at random and fitted together to
form a perfect watch ; as yon note the handling
of the parts by dainty and skilful fingers, the
delicacv of the process, and the thoroughness and
care as to every detail, you find it difficult to
imagine that they are not making hpndred-dollar
watches ; and you then become convinced that
the Waterbury is cheap, not because poorly made,
but because unique and simple in construction.

Malchook’s Doom-A Story of the
Nicholson River.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
It was Malchook who told the beginning of this
story, and Malchook was supposed to be the
biggest liar in the Gulf of Carpentaria, which is
equivalent to saying that he was the biggest liar
in the world. However, it was on record that he
told the truth sometimes —when he was in a blue
funk, for instance, and on this occasion his state
of funk was a dazzling purple—blue was no name
We were camped on the Nicholson for the wet
season. The cattle had been turned out and we
had pretty hard work to keep them together, for,
after the rain set in and the country got boggy,
the niggers commenced playing up and we had to
keep going. It was raining cats and dogs that
night and we were all huddled together round the
fire under a bit of a bark lean-to which we had
put up. Malchook was away —his horses were
absent that morning and he had been away all
day after them. It was about eight o clock when
we heard him coming; he had found his horses
and was driving them right up to the camp. Then,
instead of hpbbling them, he got a bridle and a
halter, caught them and tied them up to a tree.
Some of the fellows sang out to him to know
what he was doing, but he took no notice, and,
after turning out the horse he had been riding,
came up to the fire and told Reeve (the boss) that
he wanted a word with him. Reeve got up, and
the two went over to his tent. Presently Mal-
chook came out, went over to where his duds were
under the tarpaulin that had been rigged up over
the rations, and commenced to roll them up.
Reeve came back to the fire.
“What’s up ? ” asked Thomas, Reeve’s cousin.
“ Only that fellow wants to leave to-night,
straight away, so I gave him his cheque and told
him to slide as soon as he liked ; he’s no great
loss anyway.”
“ What does he want to leave for ?”
“ Says the camp is doomed and he is going to
put as many miles as possible between himself
and us before our fate overtakes us.”
There was a general laugh, and just then Mal-
chook came out with his swag and commenced to
saddle up in the pouring rain. There was a good
moon, nearly full, although of course it was not
visible.
The fellows commenced chaffing him, for he
was not a favourite; too all-round a liar. He
stood it without a word until he was ready to
mount, then he got on his horse and, turning
round, said: “Laugh away; this time to-morrow
I ’ll have the laugh of you ; this camp is doomed !
He stuck the spurs in his horse and disappeared
swish, swish, swish, through the bog down the
bank of the river, and we heard him swearing at
his pack-horse as he crossed the sand.
There was much laughter and wonderment at
what had sent Malchook “off his chump,” but
eccentricity was common in those days, from
various causes, and presently we all turned in.
I was sleeping under the tarpaulin where the
rations were stored, and about two o’clock in the
morning I suddenly awoke. It was brilliant
moonlight, the wind had changed and the rain
ceased, only a little scud was flitting across the
sky, giving the moon that strange appearance that
everybody must occasionally have noticed—as
though she was travelling at express rate through
an archipelago of cloy diets. Some impulse made
me get out from under the mosquito-net and go to
the opening at the end of the tarpaulin and look
Everything was very still and quiet; all the
horses were camped, for not a bell could be heard,
and I stood for some time aimlessly listening and
looking at the glistening pools of water lying on
the flat between our camp and the bank when
suddenly I distinctly heard a human voice in the
bed of the river. I waited for a moment to make
sure, then I got my Martini and a, couple of
cartridges and sneaked towards the river. Last
full-moon the niggers had nearly clubbed the cook
in his mosquito-nets when he was sleeping outside
the tent one night; this time, I thought, it would
be a case of the biters bit. 9
About a hundred yards from the camp! stopped
and listened ; the voice was much nearer, it was a
white man’s, it was Malchook’s, and he was kick-
ing his knoeked-up horse along and dragging the
pack-horse after him. I waited behind a tree
until he was close up, and then I stepped out. 1
was only in my shirt, with the carbine in my
ha,1 ‘Great God ! ” he cried, with a kind of choke,
“ he’s here again ! ”
“What the devil is up with you?” 1 said;
“ why didn’t you stop away when you went ? Got
bushed, I suppose, and the horses brought you
back ?”
He’sat on his horse and panted for a few
minutes without speaking; then he said: inat
infernal old nigger wouldn’t let me go. He hunted
me back. I’ve got to share your fate, so let’s get
it over.” , . , ... T
He jabbed his heels in his horse s ribs, but i
stopped him. “ Don’t wake the camp up, I said.
“ What nigger do you mean ?”
“ The nigger that Jacky the Span and i roasted
in the spinifex. He’s headed me back every road
I’ve tried, and I give it up. Let me turn the
h irses out, and try and get a wink of sleep.”
Jacky the Span was an old blackguard of a
Mexican who had been knocked on the head about
six months before. Everybody said he richly
deserved it, and everybody was right.
“ When were you up here with Jacky Span . l
asked. , . ~
“ About two years ago; tire time Bratten was
killed ; but let me turn out the horses and 111 tell
you all about it.” , . ,
We went quietly back to camp, let the tired
horses go, and then Malchook laid do.wn on
his blankets alongside of me. The tarpaulin
was rigged some distance from the other tents,
and the boys were done-up and sleeping sound, so
nobody awoke. This is what Malchook told me -
Two years before, he and the old Mexican had
come up to join Bratten in mustering some horses
that had got away from the lower part of the
river and were supposed to be knocking about
below the first gorge. Like most half-breeds,
Jacky the Span (short for Spaniard) was a
most inhuman brute towards the natives when-
ever he got a chance, and Malchook,
a blowhard and a bully, was naturally of the
same cowardly disposition —most liars are. One
day they spotted an old man and a young
gin at the foot of a spinifex ridge that runs in on
the Upper Nicholson. I knew the place real
old man spinifex that would go through a leather
legging. They rounded the old black up on the
top of the ridge, but missed the gin, and Jacky
Span said he would make the man find her or
ho should suffer, and Malchook, in order to keep
up his reputation as a flash man and a real 010
Gu llhand, aided and abetted him.
i suppose the poor devil was too frightened
to understand what they really wanted, but, any-
how, all the half-caste devilry, which is the worst
devilry in the world, was roused in the Mexican*
and Malchook followed suit. ,
They selected a bank of _ old man spinifex, and
rolled the naked nigger i n it for sport. Now,
spinifex is beastly poisonous stuff ; get your shins
well pricked, and it is worse than any amount oi
mosquito-bites for irritating you and making you
itch. Horses will not face it after a day or two
in really bad country, and if you run your hand
down their skins you will soon see the reason why.
Every little prick festers, and their legs are
covered with tiny boils and ulcers after a few days
in bad spinifex. The niggers always burn it
ahead of them before they travel through it. Uut
in the real Never-Never they have regular tracks
that they keep burnt down.
By the time they had rolled this nigger in
the spinifex for some minutes, he must have been
in a raging hell of torment; and he knew no
more what they wanted with him than he did at
the start. Then, according to Malchook, Jacky
rolled him into a big bank of dry stuff T they had
tied his feet together—and set tire to it. bpmi-
fex is rare stuff to burn, it is full of turpentine,
and burns with a fierce heat and a black smoke,
so the old nigger was well roasted ; and when it
burnt out they rolled him into another and set
that alight. A gust of wind sprung up and
started the whole ridge ablaze, and the gin, who
had been hidden close by, watching them, sprang
out and ran for it, and Jacky Span picked up the
old man’s club and took after her. He was away
about half-an-hour; meantime the old fellow died,
groaning awfully, and Malchook began to feel as
if he had better have let things alone.
Presently, Jacky Span came back with the
club in his hand—big two-handed clubs they use
out on the Nicholson-and showed Malchook
some blood and hair on it, and laughed like a
devil. No need to repeat here all he said.
Now, if Malchook had there and then blown a
government road through the brute, there might
have been some chance of repentance left for him,
but he didn’t. He sniggered and let Jacky Span
tell him all about it, and camped with him lor
weeks afterwards. Jacky Span was killed, as i
said before, and Malchook assured me, in a sweat-
ing blue funk when he spoke, that just at dark
he had met his horses coming back, with the old
roasted nigger behind driving them. He went
on to say that this thing had followed him right
up to the river and shrieked at him that he would
die in the camp. Then he went on to tell that
Avhen he tried to get away from the camp that
night the old nigger had met him at every point
of the compass, so at last he gave it up and came
'" Now I knew that there had been an importa-
tion of brandy lately into the Gulf country,
generally known as the “possum brand, each
bottle of which was calculated to make a man see
more devils than any six bottles of any other
brand. It was very popular, for it would eat holes
in a saddle-cloth, so I concluded that Malchook
had got hold of some of it, for one of the fellows had
returned from Burketown that day. 1 his would
account for the ghost of the blackfellow, but the
rest of the yarn about Jacky Span I knew to be
true so I told Malchook to clear out and sleep
somewhere else-I wouldn’t have him under the
same tarpaulin with me. He begged and prayed
to be allowed to remain, but I told him I would
wake the camp and tell everything if he didn t go,
so he went, sobbing bitterly. I explained to him
that the best thing he could do was to shoot him-
self • that a man who could follow the lead ot a
miserable half-caste out of pure flashness was too
contemptible to live, but he didn’t appreciate my
kindness, and slouched away to a bit of a sand-
hump about 150 yards from the camp, and I saw
him throw his blankets down and then lie down
on them. I got into my bunk again and went
fast asleep in two minutes.
Reeve woke me up. It was broad daylight.
“The niggers were here last night, ” he said.
“ Did you hear any thing ?”
“ No,” I replied; “ but Malchook came back ; i
saw him.” , , , , , ,
“Yes. They knocked him on the head—bashed
his skull in. He was sleeping out under that tree.
I suppose he was ashamed to wake us up.”
“ Nobody hear anything ?” I asked.
“ Not a sound. There are the traces of about
six niggers coming out of the river towards the
camp, and they must have stumbled right on top
of Malchook. Poor devil! Polished him off and
cleared out. The camp was doomed for him,
after all.” , ,
I concluded to say nothing, beyond having seen
Malchook come back and speaking to him. borne-
times I wonder whether I was not responsible for
his death by hunting him away from the camp,
but I always console myself with the reflection
that he only got what he deserved.
BINGHI.
Mining at Sudesfc (New Guinea) and St.
Aignan, the neighbouring island, still lingers on.
The old hands make wages, but they have to
work hard for it, and when supplies run short
have to subsist on sago, like the natives. Un
Sudest (Tagula) most of the work is fossicking
and dish-washing. At St. Aignan (Misima) they
so in for sluicing. There are about 40 Europeans
on each island. At Sudest some of the natives
manage to obtain a little gold on their own
account and trade it with the Europeans, but at
St. Aignan the formation is against them. Some
reefs have been opened out and some stone sent
to Queensland, but the reefs are very thin.

Murphy’s Selection.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
When Isaac Dodd, owner of Doolabin station,
heard that 040 acres, the pick of the run, had
been taken up on the creek, he felt inclined to go
out and defile the grave of the legislator who in-
troduced the first Land Act.
“ Good heavens ! it’s the best piece of grass-
land for miles round, and has a splendid frontage
to Doolabin Creek, and after giving me the sole
u_-e of it for nearly 14 years it is an accursed piece
of Government injustice to allow it to be selected.”
There was not much logic in Dodd’s argument •
but like many of his class he hated the very name
of selector, and in any case he never was logical.
Since the first Land Act became law it had cost
him much money to buy out the selectors who
took up land on the run. Also, it had cost
much dummying and hard swearing to secure
oyer 70,000 acres of the finest country in the
district, and this new invasion made him especially
mad. , J
piece of ground taken up by a man named
Murphy was situated within a few miles of the
homestead, and in such a position as to cut off
Dodd from his best paddocks. Lor a good many
years would-be selectors were led to believe that
it was freehold, but one Friday morning this ruse
came to an end, and James Murphy quietly
walked into the local land office and secured the
choice block. Thoroughly conversant with the
land laws, Dodd did his utmost to upset the
application, but for the nonce met his match.
. “Look here. old man,” ho said, finding’ that
bullying didn t work, “ you’ll never make a living
on tins piace. Chuck it up, and X will give vou a
trifle to go and select better country elsewhere.”
“No fear,” said Murphy, as lie dug a hole’for
the first post. “I’ve seen that sort of thino-
worked too often; I’m going to put in the residen-
tial clause, and then if you like to come to me I
may take five pounds an acre for it.”
This was a part of one of the many conversa-
tions the two men had, but they always ter-
minated in the same way. Also, with each
succeeding conversation Murphy’s language grew
stronger. One day, when the squatter had been
pushing matters pretty warmly, he stopped work-
ing and issued an ultimatum: “For Heaven’s
sake, take your carcase from here. Aren’t you
satisfied with what you’ve got, without wishing to
own all the earth? Look at the men you’ve
bought out, and tell me how much better off are
they for selling their homes to the like of you ’
Now, look here, Mr, Dodd, if you value a sound
skin, takß my advice and keep off this selection,
tor 111 put the dogs on you the next time you
come through those slip-rails.”
Dodd took the advice, and though it went
against his grain to see huts go up, paddocks
tenced off, and the timber rung, he came no more.
But all sorts of unaccountable troubles descended
upon Murphy. The boundary-rider had strict
orders to impound any of the selector's stock
found on the run. More than this, his gates were
constantly found open, his slip-rails down, and his
fences damaged. Also, the inspector of condi-
tional purchases, who always dined well at
Dodd s, paid him more attention than he did to
all the other selectors put together.
But the five years were nearly up, and then
Murphy s troubles would, to a certain extent be
oyer. One day, to his great surprise, Dodd made
his appearance at the hut.
“Well, you’ve come again,” said Murohy, as
he leaned over a sheep he was skinning.
Y\;s, but as a friend this time. Look here,
your term will be up in less than six months,
won t it ?”
‘‘Yes.”
Well, when you get your certificate I’ll give
you <42 10s. an acre for the land, and cash on the
nad. It s more than it is worth, but I want it for
a purpose.”
No, I didn’t put nearly five years’ hard graft
on it to sell it to you for a mere song. I told you
some time ago that if you liked to give me 45 an
acre for it you could have it, but I’ve altered my
mind. I don’t feel inclined to sell it, for I’ve got
a family to keep, so good day.”
Dodd didn’t take the hint, but continued to
stand near.
, Well,” he said, as he watched him take the
sain and fling it over the fence, “you might think
better of it if I call to-morrow.”
You needn’t call, for I’m going to the town.
My wife and youngsters are sick, and the boys are
away shearing.”
“ Yery well, you’re a fool.”
“ Perhaps.”
I say,” continued Dodd, “ you kill a good few
sheep. ”
“ Supposing I do, I pay for them, and I have
men as well as children to feed.”
“ Do your own killing, I suppose ? ”
“Yes.”
“How often?” continued Dodd, in quite a
friendly way.
About two a week now that stripping is on,
and I have extra, men,” gruffly replied Murphy,
making his way inside, and leaving the squatter
nothing else to do but mount and depart, which he
did with a face that betokened mischief.
Murphy was absent for three days, and returned
to find the me&t-Ccislc pretty low. In the evening l
he killed a sheep and had just slung the body to a
beam when Dodd appeared, accompanied by a
mounted trooper.
“ Well,” said Murphy, “ back on the old
errand ?”
Yes. I want to know if all those skins on
the fence are off your own sheep ?”
‘‘Yes. Why do you ask ?”
“ Vou kill nothing but those branded by you ?”
said Dodd, taking no notice of Murphy’s ques-
tion.
Yes. But what the devil are you driving at?”
I have a warrant to search your premises. I
have lost a number of sheep, and my suspicion is
directed to you. Constable Brown, let us look at
these skins.”
Go and look, and be d dto you,” said
Murphy, continuing his job.
I hey walked to the fence, and the first two
skins lifted from the top rail were plainly marked
with Dodd’s tar-brand.
“ Murphy, are these skins off your sheep ?”
“ Yes, I told you before.”
Dodd stepped aside, and picked up the head of
a sheep lately severed from some carcase. “ And
this is your breed ?”
course >” replied the unsuspecting Murphy.
I hen 1 charge you with sheep-stealing. These
skins are branded with ray brand, and this,”
pointing to the head, “has my ear-mark.”
Needless to go closely into the matter. Murphy
was arrested and tried in his own town. His
friends rallied round him to a man, and the best
counsel was secured. He pleaded not guilty. An
able barrister pointed out how hostile the squatter
had always been, and how easy it was for anyone to
carry the skins and the head of a sheep on to the
premises during the absence of the accused, as the
men slept in a shed in the wheat-paddock. The
very acts of the prisoner pointed to his inno-
cence, and it was the duty of the jury to
acquit him. A number of witnesses were called
to testify to the good character he had always
borne; but in spite of all this the jury, a mixed
one, faded to agree. He was tried again at
another town some 30 miles off, with a similar
result, and a third time at yet another town,
where a squatter’s jury brought him in guilty,
without the slightest hesitation, and he was sen-
tenced to five years in a country gaol, the'first
nine months in solitary confinement.
He has just finished his term, and has been wel-
comed back by sundry friends, who are still posi-
tive that he was innocent of the charge brought
against him. Further, there are men who openly
say that the whole thing was “worked up.” At
any rate he came out to find that the adminis-
trators of the land laws of N.S. Wales deemed
that he had failed to comply with the residential
clause, that his selection was classed as for-
feited. It is now part of the Doolabin run.
This sketch is not an imaginary one for the
facts related are part of the liistory of the
N.S.W. land laws, the names alone being fictitious.

Byron was an English pianoforte-tuner,
who had been in Australia only about four
months. Like the ordinary Englishman, he
thought that he could run rings round the Aus-
tralians in everything. It was his second trip
round the N.S.W. Western districts, and he
carried a breech-loader with him in the buggy.
He boasted considerably of the number of
opossums he was shooting daily, and said he was
going to cure their skins and send two rugs to
England. The “boys” at one of the western
hotels decided to take the conceit out of Byron.
One day at dinner-time one of them asked another
how many white opossums he had shot the pre-
vious day. Byron was interested at once. He
made numerous enquiries, and was crammed with
full particulars as to the locale of the white
opossums aforesaid. Next day, acting on the
advice of the boys, he sallied forth in the broiling
sun about 11 a.m. The ring-barked paddock
which he had been informed was teeming with
these curiosities about noon every day, was three
miles from town. To this paddock, and all over
its 1280 acres, and then back to town, Byron man-
fully walked. Needless to say he brought back
no opossums of any kind. He left that even-
ing after taking tea alone in a private parlour.
Next time he visited the town he stayed at
another hotel. The boys have not yet ascertained
whether he sent “ home ” the rugs. When ques-
tioned on the subject Byron is as silent as the
Oneen’a af.atiifi.

What matters it if, by-and-bv,
Our Aryan race should waneand die.
And Mongol with dark Ethiop vie
To rule the wide world, by-and-by ?
Infinity of Time hath Seen
Changes as strange as this, I ween—
What matter’d it ?
What matters it if we rebel
Against life’s misery, and sell
Thu weary years, we know so well,
For Death’s exchange ? They’re ours to sell'
And when we lie in endless sleep,
Should one or none in memory weep
What matters it ?
What matters it, lives good or ill,
For self or kind? we but fulfil
Our task as doth the water-mill :
The current flows—it can’t be still,
Should summer dry the flowing stream,
Our work is done, was it a dream ?
What matters it ?
What matters it? the end comes fast,
The sea is wild, the night-cloud cast,
A comrade’s aid in vain is asked :
Sauvc quipeut! is best at last.
Together sink the true and base,
A careless Fate, death marks each face—
What matters it?
What matters it ? What matters all
In life—if life be end of all ?
Our loves and longings fade and fall ;
And sadly glide beyond recall
The years which should be brightest, best,
Then asks our heart, sick with unrest—

A STRAYAWAY.
Two tons of human hair, the largest mass
ever gathered together in the world’s history, were
given, by 50,000 women of Japan, to make the
necessary ropes wherewith to hoist into their
places the beams of a temple erected to a god
who never heard or answered a prayer, the cost of
the temple being .£1,400,000. They cut off and
gave that which was their crowning feature of
beauty, at the simple request of the priests of
their god.
The Maoriland “native-interpreters”—
mostly Englishmen—who often have learnt the
language from book-sources rather than from the
Maoris, often make ludicrous mistakes, especially
in cases where native words, somewhat similar in
sound, have an altogether different origin and
meaning from each other, and where the distin-
guishing accentuations are so vague that the
meaning can only be gathered from the context.
For example: “ Tai po ” signifies “the night
tide,” and “ taipo ”is “the Devil.” Also,
“ tai epa ” is “the morning tide,” and “ taihepa”
“a fence.” An old, dignified native is giving his
evidence, in which he describes an attack upon a
hostile “ pah.” He has stated that his son, who
has been fighting at his side, received his death-
wound from a bullet fired from the “ pah.” As
his son fell, the old man turned to him, crying:
“ Depart, my son, on the evening tide (tai po) ; I
will follow on the morning tide (tai epa).” A
poetic simile, .by which he expressed his in-
tention of following his son to another world
after meeting his death in a morning attack on
the stronghold. The inexperienced interpreter
knocked all the poetry out of the sentence when
he translated it thus ; “ Go, my son, to the devil;
T will follow on the fence.”

(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Somewhere in the mystic future, on the road to Paradise,
There’s a very pleasant country that I’ve dreamed of once
or twice,
It has inland towns, and cities by the ocean’s rocky shelves,
But the people of the country differ somewhat from our-
selves ;
It is many leagues beyond us, and they call it Otherside,
And there is among its people more Humanity than Pride.
Now, a social system never was complete, without a flaw,
And among the Othersiders there is love and gold and
war.
But if one is fairly beaten he can turnupon the track,
For, in such a case there isn’t any shame in going back ;
And a broken-hearted mortal never thinks of suicide,
For he finds amongst his brothers more Humanity than
Pride.
And the lords of that creation never scoff at s.tuple
things—
Never scorn the lad who’s tethered to his mother's apron-
strings,
He will speak of “ home ” and “ mother ” without shame
when he’s inclined.
Yet the blow he strikes in battle mostly leaves a mark
behind.
They are brave against invasion—they can die in Other-
side
Tho’ there is among the people more Humanity than
Pride.
Poets sing in simple language that a child might under-
stand,
Yet their songs are sung for ages by the elders of the land,
And the people know that Freedom never shall be wanting
guards,
For the foremost in the vanguard waves the banner of the
Bards. "»
Oh ! the poets march together, and at homo in peace
abide.
For there is amongst the people more Humanity than
Pride.
And when I am very weary, ’neath a load of “ worldly
care,”
There are times when I've a longing Just to hump my
bluey there ;
But alone I could not reach it - for the track is barred to
one—
I must take the nations with me—all mankind must go, or
none—
And we’d trample one another on the way to Otherside,
For I find among my brothers less Humanity than Pride.
Sydney, December, ’9l.
HENRY LAWSON.
IT RECALLS THE BLIZZARD.
In March, 1888, the great blizzard in America
almost extinguished the city of New York. The
like of it was never before seen. The snow com-
pletely stopped all local traffic. Not a horse or a
wheel could move. All the telegraph lines lead-
ing into the city were prostrated, and for two or
three days the people of Boston and New York
communicated with each other by way of London
by means of the Atlantic cables. Thus messages
intended for three hundred miles distant were
sent six thousand miles, crossing the ocean twice.
An incident which recalls this experience to the
writer’s mind happened a short time ago here in
England. Suppose we let the gentleman in-
terested tell his own story. He says : “ I have
suffered more or less from indigestion and
dyspepsia all my life. I had a bad taste in the
mouth, pain after eating, a poor appetite, and
sour stomach. My tongue was coated, and my
mouth constantly tilled with a watery fluid. No
matter what I ate, however light, it disagreed
with me and gave me pain. I had fulness of the
chest, and pain at my side, with a miserable, low,
dull feeling. From time to time I consulted a
doctor who gave me medicines, but they did very
little good. The doctor said that the coating of
my stomach was disordered, and the mucous
m •mbrane was inflamed. In 1877 I received a
pamphlet from New York telling of a medicine
called Mother Seigel's Curative Syrup, and of the
extraordinary cures it had effected, so I procured
a supply, and after taking the first 1 felt better,
and by tire time I had taken four bottles m re, I
was completely cured, and have been in good
health, as regards the indigestion, ever since.
Having studied the practice of herbs for many
years, I was in the habit of treating people for
erysipelas and other complaints, and was fre-
quently consulted by people in the district, so
after my remarkable cure, I was so impressed
with - the merits of Seigel’s Syrup, that I procured
a large supply of the medicine, arid' recommended
it to all who were suffering, and people came from
far and near for it. I may mention that on a
S ‘.vday my house was beseiged by miner's from
C >al Pit Heath, and others from a distance. On
every hand I heard nothing but the loudest praise
o‘ it and of the cures it effected, and the fame of
this medicine was spread throughout the West of
England with no other advertising than one party
telbng another of the benefit they had derived
from this wonderful medicine. I wish every one
to know of this, and if by publishing this state-
ment it will help others who may be suffering as I
was, it will afford me pleasure.”
The letter from which the foregoing is an
extract is signed Moses Godwin, Old Sodbury
(Sudbury), Glos., and is dated April 9th, 1891.
He is a farmer.
The reader will notice that while the head-
quarters for the sale of Mother Seigel’s Syrup is
universally known to be in London, by a strange
chance Mr. Godwin’s first information concerning
it came from America, three thousand miles away,
which recalls the incident of the American blizzard
above narrated, and also shows that the fame and
usefulness of this medicine extend to all civilised
countries.
Mr. Benjamin Edgerton, grocer and provision
dealer, Plat Lane, Whixall, Whitchurch, Salop,
says: “While living with Mr. Roberts, Fens
Woods Farm, I first began to feel a dull, heav>
weight at my side, and noticed a bad taste in the
mouth with foul stomach and uncomfortable fee -
ing after eating. I had no appetite, and when I
sat down to the table I could riot touch the food.
I had a good deal of pain and noise in the head,
and could not sleep for it. 1 was not fit for heavy
work, and could only do light jobs about the
farm. After tutting a hedge I would go quite
faint, and had to sit down, and felt so much
depressed I could have cried. Having always
been such a strong man I took it badly to be
reduced to such a weak state. I took all kinds of
physic and saw a doctor, but his medicine only
eased me for a bit, and then I was worse than
before. I went on in this way for over a year,
when a servant tlfat came to live at Mr. Roberts
told mo of a medicine called Mother Seigel’s
Syrup. She had heard a gentleman talking about
it in the railway carriage, and he praised it so
much that I thought I would try it. After I had
taken two bottles my food did me good, and I
gained strength, and by persevering with the
syrup I soon got as strong as ever, and have never
ailed anything since.”
The late Earl Lytton died of “ heart-
failure.” In other words, he used to smoke 100
cigarettes daily.

England, but during 1888 no less than 820,000
persons died in Italy and only 520,000 in
England.
At a meeting of the creditors of an un-
fortunate insolvent some time ago, John Harris,
the lately deceased millionaire of Shane’s Park,
N.S.W., voluntarily and without consideration,
cancelled a debt of <£5000.
A London writer remarks that Parnell
was a born commander of armed men, and it was
the irony of Fate that he should have become the
leader of a party in Parliament. Then he goes
on to say : —
The stormy scenes of 1878-9, when obst ruction in the
House of Commons was at ils height, will never fade
from my memory. Parnell’s blanched face as he stood up
before the storm, like a rock on which the surf was beat-
ing, comes vividly before me as I write. At that time no
effectual means of meeting obstruction had been devised.
The House had only one resource ; it could not make a man
sit down, but it could drown his voice with clamour, and
this it did with Parnell. The obstructive speech was met
w ith a volume of “ Ow, ow, ow's !” which rose and fell with
a curious regularity. For hours at a stretch Parnell
would be patiently engaged in wearing out the powers of
endurance of his adversaries, edging in what he had to
say word by word and syllable by syllable. Such a word
as “ imperturbable ” it used to take him five minutes to get
over. Let me give a sample of a method of warfare
which, under the rules devised to meet it, has long since
passed into the domain of history, and will never be seen
again. Parnell (loq.): As I (Gw, ow, ow !)—as I look
—(Ow, ow, ow !)—look upon- (Ow, ow, ow !)-the face—
(Ow, ow, ow !)—of the right hon- (Ow, ow, ow !>r-honour
— (Ow, ow, ow !)—honourable—(Ow, ow, ow !)—gent—(Ow,
ow, ow !) —gentle—(Ow, ow, ow !)- man —(Ow, ow, ow !)—
oppos— —(Ow, ow, ow !)-oppos — (Ow, ow, ovv!)-op
(Ow, ow, ow !)-opposite—(Ow, ow, ow!) And so
on Occasionally the temper of the man would give way,
and then, with a look of hate, he would hiss something
through his teeth without waiting for the customary lull.
The great desert of Sahara is gradually
being reclaimed under the sedulous care of the
irrigationists. Nearly fourteen thousand artesian
wells have been sunk in French Algeria. About
twelve million acres have been reclaimed, and the
once barren, death-generating sand prairie is
becoming productive of the grape and palm.
Fifty years ago or so the English yacht
Wanderer touched at Sydney and reported that
the owner, Mr. Boyd, had landed upon Guadal-
canal Solomon Islands, and gone hunting, after
which he was never seen again. An American
paper now reports that the island natives aver
that Boyd was shot by men of his own party who
landed with him.
The N.S. W. licensed surveyors have a real
grievance in the matter of the now Ministerial
regulation anent the issue of annual license foes,
and for once wo partly agree with the Sydney
daily press. Surveyors’ permits can hardly be rated
as trade licenses ; they are certificates of efficiency
merely.
Queensland mangoes have of late been
sent to Sydney in large quantities. The sale has
been somewhat checked by the high prices asked,
but still all supplies up to date have found buyers.
The mango, in the opinion of those who have
sampled most of the world’s fruits, is the most
delicious of all. Mungo-eating is said to be an
“acquired taste,” but most people somehow
manage to acquire it in two minutes after inter-
viewing their first mango ; and once a liking for
the fruit (a thoroughly wholesome one) has been
contracted, the appetite becomes a perfect passion.
Mangoes are not a dessert-fruit; they cannot be
eaten gracefully. The best way to eat them is to
take off most of your clothes and sit in a paddock
alone alongside a case of mangoes, a bath-towel,
and a big bucket of water. As in Burmah the
King and Court stop all business and go into
complete privacy when the dorian is ripe, so
Australia, should the Bananalanders continue to
enlarge their tropical-fruit plantations, may yet
adjourn for a general holiday when the mango
becomes yellow up North,
A Wellington (M.L.) family, named
Edwards, went out to a picnic the other day, and
by all accounts enjoyed themselves thoroughly.
They got home about dusk, and knocked at the
door, but the expected servant-girl didn’t come to
open it. When they got tired of waiting they
looked through the keyhole in the hope of seeing
somebody coming along the hall, and amid the
uncertain shadows inside one member of the party
thought she saw two feet that seemed to be rest-
ing on the door-handle inside. It was such a
surprising place for feet that the picnic party
unanimously burst through the window to in-
vesligate and found the,servant girl in a partially
dressed state suspended from a rope at the back
of the door. She had let The fire go out, and
hadn't even laid the table before hanging herself.
Also the gas was turned off, and the corpse had
mislaid the matches, arid just at that moment it
began to rain, and what with the darkness and
the slushy sounds outside, and the darkness and
the dead servant inside,)it was a solemn conclusion
to a picnic. That family will go on no more
picnics for a long time.
