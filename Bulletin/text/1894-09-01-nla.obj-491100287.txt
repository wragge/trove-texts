BOOKS OF THE DAY.
On receipt at Box 659, G.P.O., Sydney, of Postal Order, Postal Notes, or Stamps equal to
the price stated, any book in the subjoined list will be forwarded to any Australian address
“THE YELLOW ASTER,”
By Iota. 6s. ; posted, 6s. 6d.
HUTCHINSON & CO. 8vo., Cloth, 307pp.
When a book goes through a dozen editions in little more than as many weeks, the proof is pretty conclusive that it cannot be dull, at all events. And dulnesa
is the last reproach that can be flung at “A Yellow Aster.” It is “queer,” to be sure. Not many girls in Australia grow up incapable of flirtation, and prepared to offer
a merely experimental “ Yes ” when the fateful question is popped by an eligible partner. Exactly how queer and how entertaining this book is can only be found out
by personal perusal. Press notices hitherto have mainly suggested a charm without doing much to define it. And as the germ of “ A Yellow Aster ” was.found in
Australia, and the authors were for some time residents of Melbourne, the book has special interest for Australian readers. This edition is tastefully bound, and very
neatly printed.
“THE LAST SENTENCE,”
By Maxwell Gray. 3s. 6d.; posted, 3s. lid.
HEINEMANN’S COLONIAL LIBRARY. 8vo., Cloth, 311pp.
Many people will read this story with a great deal of pleasure and interest. “ The Silence of Dean Maitland,” by the same author, remains after many years a
prime favorite : and “ A Last Sentence ” is very similar in method and treatment. Several strong situations lead up to the climax, when a judge is called upon to-
sentence to death his own daughter, and here the average novel-reader will thrill and palpitate with excitement. A like incident, indeed, is strongly put in Lytton’s
“ Paul Clifford ” and Franzes’ “ Chief Justice ;” and the author has found it necessary in a preface to deny having read either book. But, if a rose be sweet, what does it
matter that others have plucked one as sweet before us? Anyhow, “Paul Clifford” is forgotten, and “The Chief Justice” has never been known enough to be remem
bered. “ The Last Sentence ” is bound to have a great vogue.
“THE PRISONER or ZEADA,”
By Anthony Hope. 2s. 6d.; posted, 2s. lOd.
MACMILLAN’S COLONIAL LIBRARY. 8m, paper, 310pp.
This story, to hand by the last mail, might easily have been told on the Thousand and Second Night. The hero suddenly finds himself masquerading as king of
a little German State during the indisposition of the rightful monarch, and the trouble that he has in defending his borrowed crown proves conclusively that there is
nothing in monarchy —in small German States. There is an adventure, with drawn revolvers and flashing sabres, on every page, and blood flows like colonial beer on a
navvies’ pay-day. Adventurous people whom unkind Eate has set to handle spades and flashing pens can read “ The Prisoner ” for a change.
“THE RUBIOOA,”
By E. F. Benson. 2s. 6d. ; posted, 2s. lOd.
BELL’S INDIAN AND COLONIAL LIBRARY. 8m, Paper, 394pp.
This is Mr. Benson’s second novel. His first, “ Dodo,” said to be a portrait of the lady who is making Mr. Asquith happy, came in the first flight of the rushing ■
throng which have exhibited London society as a leper asylum in evening dress. The lepers who cross “The Rubicon ” give reason to think that their doctors and nurses
have a lively time of it. The lady leper, having been persuaded into a loveless marriage, makes herself so disagreeable that the gentleman leper, who isn’t a bad sort of a
leper at all, is glad to do it with prussic acid, or something. Then the lady arranges things badly with the other fellow, and across the brook she goes. Of course, such a
book is bound to be more or less the rage. And nobody can claim to be really up-to-date in end-of-the-century literature unless he (she) has taken a psychological dive into
the depths and shallows of “ The Rubicon.”
“ LESS of the H’URBERYILLES,”
By Thomas Hardy. 2s. 6d. ; posted, 2s. lOd.
BELL’S INDIAN AND COLONIAL LIBRARY. 8vo., Paper, 520pp.
This is a cheap re-issue of a book adjudged three years ago to be a masterpiece of English fiction —a judgment which the lapse of time has strengthened and
confirmed. Thomas Hardy has no superior but George Meredith among contemporary novelists : with that noble exception he is peer of the highest. He is no mere
prattler of witticisms : his stories are not dummies for the display of a style filed and fitted to the ninth part of a hair; he writes for Fame and Time, not to gratify a
false taste of the fickle, momentary public. In “Tess” he has given us of his best. Conception is as strong as execution. No wonder that the book startled Mrs. Grundy
in her strongholds. The author deliberately challenges conventions and prejudices, and declares that purity is an ethereal essence of the spirit, not of the body : that a
wronged woman may stand on a level with her of the most sheltered virtue ; and that there are saner and wider views of sex than those held by the diseased minds of
monkish mystics and incorporated in traditional religion. This edition is well printed in large type, and has an excellent portrait of the author.
“REMINISCENCES of the GREAT MUTINY,”
By W. Forbes-Mitchell. 2s. 6d. -, posted, 2s. lOd.
MACMILLAN’S COLONIAL LIBRARY. 8vo., paper, 295pp.; with maps.
A glimpse of the Indian Mutiny from the inside. The average historian, writing, as a rule, long after the events which he describes, has a difficulty in
identifying himself with the men who have moved them. Do what he will, they remain mere puppets of his mind, things extern and often unintelligible. The author of
these Reminiscences, a sergeant in the 93rd (Sutherland) Highlanders, saw the events which he chronicles; and his unpretentious narrative has a vigour and a thrill which
more studied performances frequently lack. The chief episode dealt with is the Siege of Lucknow. Many personal anecdotes are interspersed ; and the book, as a whole,
is readable and informing.
“THE LAST of SIX”:
TALES OF THE AUSTRAL TROPIGS.
BY
ERNEST FAVENC.
With prefatory note by
Rolf Boldrewood.
PRICE : : Is.
Posted to any Australian
Address, Is. Sd.
“ The volume takes its name from one of the sketches, ‘ The Last of Six,’ though in point of merit they all stand pretty well on a par. The
author, who is familiar with life in Northern Queensland, writes with vigour about the doings of the whites and the natives in these faraway
parts. A strong vein of mysticism runs through his narratives, and there are ghosts in almost every chapter, and for those who are fond of
realistic work the volume will prove attractive reading.”—S.M. Herald, July 8, 1893.
“ No writer has given the world a more vivid description of Australia and its wilderness than Ernest Favenc, and the secret of this is that
he has, by many years’ experience of travel and bush life, acquired a knowledge of this continent which is possessed by scarcely any other writer.
He, too, possesses great descriptive powers. Whatever he puts pen to is certain to be good. In the stories under notice he has given us some of
his best work. That they will be widely read is certain.” —Sydney Mail, July 8, 1893.
“ They present with force and vividness, as well as with the accuracy arising from long contact and keen observation, striking pictures of
parts of Australia unfamiliar to most of its inhabitants ; they tell, sometimes with remarkable power, of incidents such as happen in wild places
when human hearts are stirred by strong passions, and of weird imaginings that move the minds of lonely men. * The Last of Six ’ is a terrible
tale of cannibalism, treachery, and revenge upon the dead, which in other hands might be gross and hideous, but which Mr. Favenc makes of
thrilling interest. ‘ The Haunt of the J inkarras ’ suggests Rider Haggard and his imitators to some extent, but is itself relieved from the
suspicion of imitation by faithful local colour and a grotesquerie of conception, in which Mr. Favenc here and there approaches Poe. This
characteristic is especially noticeable in * Spirit Led,’ which the great American might have written, * A Cup of Cold Water’ is, perhaps, the
best tale in a collection that should be widely read, and which forms a worthy addition to jpurely Australian literature.”—Daily Telegraph
July 15, 1893.
“‘The Last of Six ;’and other stories. By Ernest Favenc, (Sydney: The Bulletin Newspaper Co) This is a collection of short but
graphic sketches by Mr. Favenc, the well-known explorer, who has a rare collection of Australian legendary lore. All the stories here are good,
and we can heartily endorse the recommendatory notice by Rolf Boldrewood prefixed to this collection. The present issue forms the third of The
Bulletin series of Australian reminiscences.”—Australian Star, July 15,1893.

INDIGESTION
And Liver Complaint
CUBED BY USING
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla
Mr. T. J. CLUNE,
of Walkerville, S. Australia, -writes:
“Six years ago, I had an attack of Indiges-
tion and Liver Complaint that lasted for
weeks; I was unable to do any hard work,
had no appetite, food distressed me, and I
suffered much from headache. My skin was
sallow and sleep did not refresh me. I tried
&
\1
several remedies and consulted a doctor,
without obtaining any relief; finally, one of
my customers recommended Ayer’s Sarsapa-
rilla; it helped me from the first,—ln fact,
after taking six bottles I was completely
cured, and could eat anything and sleep
like a child.” •

The Caligraph Writing Machine,
M
m
THE CALIGRAPH embodies all the highest
developments of applied mechanics, and its
principle having stood the test of 15 years, its
success towers above the fantastic devices of mush-
room competitors.
“ I like Caligraph writing better than that of
any other typewriter because the type comes out
so sharply and clearly.” The prominent Anglican
clergyman, who used these words, had hit upon
the chief characteristic of the Caligraph without
exactly knowing what brought it about. The
result is attributable to the fact that ths platen of
the Caligraph being bevelled the type strike
against a flat surface thus producing a full and
even impression. When you see typewriting with
only the middle of the letters clear you know that
the machine used was not a Caligraph, but one
fitted with the ordinary round platen. When you
read a typewritten letter, with some of the type
leaning to the right and the rest to the left, you
may be sure that your correspondent has a crude
machine, with curved typebars, which naturally
become more crooked, and thus twist their type
out of perpendicular. Then remember that the
Caligraph has straight typebars which, like every-
thing else in the machine, are fitted with adjust-
able bearings.
The Caligraph manifolds 15 carbon copies at
one operation, and used with the Edison Mimeo-
graph reduplicates 1500 copies from one stencil.

Afternoon Tea a Specialty•
When A. G. Taylor’s old constituency of
Mudgee heard of his defeat at the poll for East
Sydney, some kindly spirits telegraphed him :
“ Your best friends here have no sympathy !
This result is damnable ! Weep!” It is always
one’s best friends who rub it in after this
fashion.
Ex-Chief Justice Stephen, of N.S.W.,
celebrated his 92nd birthday on Monday week, and
received numerous congratulations, including the
felicitations, delivered in person, of no less than
60 members of his family. The only non-relative
privileged to see the veteran on this occasion was
the irrepressible Mandarin Tart, who called in
full fig, accompanied by a big birthday-cake.
The Bulletin has noticed on more than one
occasion a somewhat grotesque coincidence : the
Draconian ex-Judge’s birthday seems, by some
strange fatality, to be selected by Australian
Governments as a day for hangings. True to pre-
cedent, they butchered a man at Melbourne last
Monday.
Dear Bulletin, —The lastnewsfromSamoa
described the native war as still fizzling, while
hungry soldiers stole R. L. Stevenson’s fowls.
Samoa evidently wants some more British Govern-
ment. At present it only costs her 74,000 dols. a
year for “law and order.” By-and-by she will
advance to the Fijian status, and feed a staff of
snobs and Govt, cricket team for <£74,000 a year—
five times as much. Down in Tonga, which once
called itself Tonga the Forbidden (Tonga-tabu) is
a constitutional Kingdom with independent native
administration, “on British models.” Marvellous
models, if one can judge by the imitation ! The
best imitation of a British model I saw in the
South Seas was a copy of a kilt.— Pohtemonnaie.
Dear Bulletin, —The “ loyal toasts were
duly honoured ” at Premier Reid’s banquet.
Bismarck called the people who yearn to cheer for
somebody who does not care a straw for them —
“ the hurrah canaille.” He ought to know. There
is no better occasion for a self-gratifying display
of loyalty than a death in any royal family. A
black ribbon round the arm indicates a kind of
distant relationship or intimacy with the deceased,
and gives an air of distinction to the mourner.
In 1888 I was at Singapore, when the Government
decided to mourn for the German Emperor.
Whenever I met a fellow with black ribbon round
his arm (and these were to non-mourners in the
proportion of about one to four) I could make cer-
tain of recognising the stamp of conceit and
stupidity on his face. Both kings and priests
found their empire on ignorance. Yours,

With an ordinary tape measure determine the width
round the joints AA, round the instep 88, round heel CO,
mund the ankle DU ; next ascertain the length and width
of tread by placing the foot on a sheet of paper, and
running a lead pencil round the heel and toes. Cut the
outline thus made with a scissors, and enclose with the
other measurements, stating what size you generally take,
what are your peculiarities—a weak ankle, perhaps a pet
corn ingrowing nails, or a blooming bunion. All these
little matters attended to, if you have a long thin foot or
a short thick one, with very high instep, send to ELLIS S,
where you are sure to get a fit. The proprietor, with a
view of introducing his new and simple system into the
country districts where practical bootmaking is unknown,

Row’s Assorted Bitters
CONTAIN
Row’s Dandelion Bitters.
We recommend these BITTERS to be taken
two or three times a day; a wineglassful for an
adult, smaller quantity for children.
For General Debility, Dyspepsia, Rheumatism,
and Cutaneous Affections.
The action of dandelion, more especially upon
the liver and kidneys, is more reliable for remov-
ing all impure secretions than any other medicinal
plant known.
Persons suffering from Skin diseases will find
these Bitters invaluable.
DIRECTIONS FOR USE.
One wineglass two or three times a day after
meals diluted with same quantity of water. For
young people about half the quantity twice a day.
They Purify the Blood and Liver.
See what a Medical Gentleman says
about them.
Messrs. E. Row and Co.
With thanks for forwarding me a bottle of your
Row’s Dandelion Bitters, and consider them most
excellent, and superior to many others that I have
previously tried. Yours faithfully, HENRY

Buchii Bitters,
BARON BERZILIUS* REPORT.
They are chiefly given in complaints of the Urinary
Organs, such as Gravel, Chronic Catarrh, morbid Irrita-
tion of the Bladder and Urethra, Diseases of the Prostrate
Glands, and Retention or Inconvenience of Urine, from
the loss of tone in the parts concerned in its evacuation.
These Bitters 1 also recommend in Dyspepsia, in Chronic
Rheumatism and Cutaneous affections. The action of
Buchu on the human frame is more effectual on all
diseases of the Kidneys and Bladder than any other herbal
plant; and it also assists persons suffering from Skin
Diseases, causing a healthy action of the secretions and
inducing perspiration.
Row’s Steane’s Bitters.
STUDY HEALTH BY TAKING ROW’S
STEANE’S BITTERS.
The great demand throughout the colony for
these pure Bitters shows they are superior to all
others and equalled by none.
Facts Speak Louder than Words.
Read this sworn testimony from a well-known
citizen:—
Statutory Declaration.
“I, George Hewett, do hereby solemnly and
sincerely declare as follows:
“That I feel it a duty I owe to the public to
state that I have been suffering for many years
from weakness of the stomach, so called INDI-
GESTION or DYSPEPSIA, and have been cured
by my taking two or three glasses of ROW’S
STEANE’S BITTERS a day in a little water, and
I hope others suffering from the same complaint
will be as speedily cured.
“(Signed) G. HEWETT,
“ 215 Pitt-street.
Row’s You’ll Do Bitters.
All who suffer from Chest Complaints, Cold, Coughs,
and general weakness of the Lungs, will gain more ease
and comfort from a wineglass of ROW’S YOU’LL DO
BITTERS than any cough medicine tried before.
Read what Medical men say about them—
BJERKIN, M.D.The Bitter is pure, and not like
others in overdoses. It has a remarkable influence on the
liver, promoting the secretions of Bile, and correcting it
when deranged, and restores healthy evacuations in oases
of habitual costiveners.
D. ECKSTROM, M.D.—BBBB—I find these Bitters a
roost valuable and wholesome tonio, being pure and
strengthening; a stimulant to the liver, assisting diges-
tion. I therefore thus recommend them.
G. B. WOOD, M.D.—lt is the purest of Bitters, and
exeits a peculiar influence over the liver.
Row’s Pepsine Bitters.
All who suffer from Weak Digestion will soon
be cured by these Bitters, taken three times a day
before meals.
Row’s Oriental Bitters.
A Splendid General Tonic, with a tumbler of
water makes a drink equal to any best Champagne.
Row’s Steane’s Wine
Is a safe and sure stimulant for the female sex or
children, for it raises and strengthens depressed
systems without producing a temporary excite-
ment to be followed by greater depression.
Persons suffering from loss of appetite and
eneral depression of spirits cannot do better than
take
ROW’S STEANE’S WINE.
I It cannot harm you, but must do good to all
delicate persons. Young Ladies can take this
when suffering from general debility. It’s only a
pure tonic. Try it.
Teetotallers will find this newly-invented
TONIC answer all the purposes of a stimulant
without its intoxicating quality. It will satisfy
the cravings of nature and create a desire for food
i instead of drink. As an anti febrile is unsur-
| When you call for these ask for
ROW’S, and take no substitute.

SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 1, 1894.
The Woman’s Suffrage Experiment.
South Australia has fallen into line with
Maoriland on the Woman’s Suffrage question,
and the greatest political experiment of the
nineteenth century is so much the nearer.
In all the Australias, as well as in almost all
other civilised lands, Woman’s Suffrage may
be set down as inevitable, and even its most
irreconcileable opponents are ‘beginning to
realise the fact. Both the womanhood and
manhood vote became practically assured
when free and compulsory education was
instituted. It was only a question of wait-
ing until the first generation reared under
the new system had come to maturity.
Therefore, the Conservatives who bitterly
opposed compulsory education were wise in
their own narrow-minded day and genera-
tion. They realised that the dominion of
the classes was founded upon ignorance, and
on ignorance alone, and that the educated
but unpropertied man of the future would
flatly refuse to believe chat he was an in-
ferior animal, and unfit to have an equal
share in the management of the State,
merely because his propertied fellow-man
told him so. And it was equally inevitable
that the educated woman of the future
would refuse to believe in her own political
incapacity merely because man assured her,
on his own unsupported statement, that she
was incapable and would always continue so.
Education is the one influence which destroys
all reverence, undermines all dogma, and
scatters veneration to the winds. The poor
man lost his superstitious respect for the
rich man when he began to study animal
physiology, and found out what the rich man
was composed of. And woman lost a good
part of her faith in the overwhelming
superiority of man when she began to dissect
him in the medical schools and found out
what he was composed of. Also, both sexes
lost most of their reverence for royalty, and
the Church, and other fetishes, because they
began to analyse them and found that they
could not be seriously dissected, because they
were made of no ponderable substance what-
ever. /
# * •
Regarded as a matter of abstract justice,
there is no argument against female suffrage
which can bear close inspection. The
allegedly inferior sex is held responsible to
the law, therefore, according to all democratic
principles, it should have a share in the
making of the law. It has to supply its
share of the State revenue, therefore, it has
a right te a share in controlling the State
expenditure. It bears its full share in the
world’s labor, therefore it has every right to
a voice in deciding what manner of world it
will be. The only serious argument against
womanhood suffrage, regarded as a matter of
ethical justice, is that the work of national
■defence falls entirely upon man, and that the
fighting part of the nation should also be the
part which governs. But, considering that
not one male in a hundred does fight for his
country if he can possibly help it, this argu-
ment tells almost as strongly against one sex
as against the other. If it means anything
at all, it means that the non-military male
should be disfranchised as well as the non-
military female, and that the country should
be governed solely by the armed forces. And,
considering that these forces are generally
altogether disfranchised, and that the fight-
ing part of the male community is the part
which, above all others, is not allowed to
govern, it is evident that the argument was
never intended to be taken seriously. Ninety-
nine per cent, of the male population defends
its country merely by contributing- to war
expenditure, and as the female population
defends its country in exactly the same
manner there is very little perceptible
difference.
• * 9
The matter at issue is not the justice of
womanhood suffrage, which is sufficiently
apparent, but its expediency, concerning
which no one really knows anything. A few
small communities have adopted the prin-
ciple with the result, so far, that those which
were previously conservative have, on the
whole, continued to be conservative, and
those which were previously progressive
have remained progressive. But the experi-
ment has never yet been attempted on a
sufficiently large scale to furnish any definite
results. Women are, by common consent,
astonishingly and comprehensively ignorant
of politics, and at first they will, to a great
extent, be fooling with the political machine
very much after the manner of a child fool-
ing with a locomotive. This was inevitable,
for no one ever learns politics except by
actual experience. Of the male voters who
were enfranchised in England by the early
Reform Bills, an enormous proportion could
neither read nor write, many had a vague
idea that electoral reform meant a general
division of property, and a very large
number did not even know the names of the
existing political parties, and recognised
them vaguely as “blues” and “yellows,”
and as nothing more. The enfranchised
woman of to-day or to-morrow starts
from a far more advanced point than
the enfranchised male of not so very many
years ago. Also, she starts from the same
point as a largo, if not the larger, proportion
of the male voters of to-day, for the great
mass of the community has no definite
political opinions of its own ; it inherits its
views, in the first place, and changes or
modifies them later on as it is told to do by
newspapers, or by political orators. The
reason why every cause or party desires to
have an organ of its own, and why it sends
its most eloquent orators out to stump the
country and deliver addresses to all and
sundry, is simply that even the most
educated community has not got any further
than a rudimentary idea that all men are
equal ; it has still to be supplied with ready-
made ideas as to how to use its equality.
# # »
The male political atom, however, despite
his constant need for a supply of ready-made
opinions, has made great since
he first attained to power. If he is still
hazy about many things which he ought to
do, he has acquired—mostly by rote—a large
amount of valuable knowledge about many
things which he ought not to do, which
knowledge prevents him dropping back
into the slough of his old, hopeless ignor-
ance. It is claimed, however, that the
female political atom is incapable of such
advancement, that she is unprogressive by
nature, ignorant, lacking in originality,
devoid of initiative and merely gifted with a
faculty for imitation, that she is priest-ridden
by instinct and conservative by an ineradi-
cable tendency for which there is no remedy.
Most of these statements, and many more of
the same kind, were, and still are, assigned
by the propertied male as a reason why the
unpropertied male should not be entrusted
with the suffrage. In that case, as in the
one now under consideration, they rested
entirely on the bare assertion of an interested
party. They were falsified in the one
instance ; whether they will or will not also
be falsified in the other no one can foresee.
According to the medical science of to-day,
the female brain is less developed and shows
far less capacity than that of the male ; the
medical science of to-morrow may endorse
this view, or, again, it may decide, as it has
so often done before, that the science of
what will then be yesterday was merely the
reasoning of fools. The woman of the past
has contributed 90 per cent, less than her
fair proportion to science, art, literature,
and progress generally ; but whether that
was owing to natural incapacity or to
countless centuries of subjection and edu-
cational neglect, can only be decided
by a lengthened trial under more equal
conditions. She has supplied little that
was new, but whether that was because
she was incapable of originality, or because
almost every outlet for ambition was denied
her, there is r: o evidence to show. Also, no
one really knows, by any reliable proof,
whether woman is, to any notable extent,
more subject to priestly influence than the
male of her species, or, if she is, whether
the circumstance arises from natural ten-
dencies or from hereditary training, or, in
either case, whether the evil is any more
incurable in her case than in that of equally
priest-ridden man of a few generations ago.
Female suffrage is absolutely experimental;
it is the one political expedient of whose
ultimate consequences no one on this earth
knows anything at all. There are practically
no data to go upon. All that is known is
that the experiment is inevitable.
* • •
Womanhood suffrage has, in a feeble sort
of way, been classed with the standing jokes
of the period. Whether this has helped it
or retarded it is difficult to say ; probably it
has done neither. It has ranked with the
mother-in-law joke, and the subtle American
humor concerning the nigger and the pump-
kin, and the various weird conceptions
regarding the tramp, and the home-made
pie, and the young man and the girl at the
front gate, and the ancient harridan in
pants. The Shrieking Sisterhood which wants
the suffrage—next-of-kin to the Shrieking
Brotherhood which wants One-man-one-vote
—has passed into a proverb. Also, it has been
proved over and over again by incontestable
argument that women should not have the
suffrage—first, because they don’t want it and
would never use it; and, second, because they
want it so badly that they would presently
devote their entire time to politics, to the
neglect of all other duties. Both these latter
facts, by the way, were also proved in the
case of the unpropertied male voter when it
was first proposed to entrust him with the
franchise. But logic and alleged humor are
equally of no account in the case, for
the humor is feeble and stale, and the
logic has no definitely ascertained facts to
start from. All that is known is that woman-
hood suffrage is based on abstract justice ;
that it is obviously inevitable ; and that no
one knows what it will lead to. The Bul-
letin supports it because it is based on
abstract justice ; it acquiesces in it because
it is inevitable, and the person who refuses
to acquiesce in the inevitable is merely
shaking an impotent talon at the universe ;
and it inwardly objects to it because it leads
towards unknown and unforeseeable conse-
quences. If this attitude is rather less
coherent than it might be, the intricacy of
the problem is responsible.

“The Bulletin” Knows a Bank.
The report of the Q. Auditor General for 1892-3
contains these words :
The Bank of England advanced the Govt. £400,000 on
June 17, 1892, which was repaid by the sale of Treasury
Bills in Oct., 1892. Another advance of £600,000 was ob-
tained from the Bank of England on Deo. 20, 1892, and
was repaid from the proceeds of the sale of inscribed stock
in Feb. and March, 1893. Both these advances were ob-
tained to provide funds for the payment of the half-
yearly interest, and the latter should not have been re-
quired, there being sufficient funds to the credit of the
Govt, ip London to meet all liabilities, especially as a
draft for £300,000 was sent from Brisbane, which, how-
ever, was only credited by the Bank on Jan. 3, 1893.
This means in plain language that the Q. Govt,
had funds sufficient to pay its half-yearly
interest lying idle with the Queensland National
Bank, in London, It implies, in addition, that
.£300,000 was sent from Brisbane in time to
help to pay interest—for unless sent in time
there was no use in sending it at all. This
sum, however, was “only (mark the ‘only’)
credited by the bank on Jan. 3, 1893 ” —after
the interest had been paid. To pay the interest,
£600,000 was borrowed from the Bank of Eng-
land—for a consideration, of course. Obviously,
such a transaction could nob pay the Govt. ;
but the Q.N. Bank was saved from disbursing
£600,000. When the bank suspended payment
on May 13, 1893, there were £748,348 to Govt,
credit at its London office. This sum, or part of
it, was included in the £2,000,000 of Govt, moneys
locked up by Act of Parliament till July 1,
1899, and repayable then by 12 half-yearly
instalments. The bank thus retains £2,000,000
for six years, and then begins to repay it at the
rate of £333,000 a year, being charged per
cent, interest meantime—a figure which little
more than covers the cost of the money to
Government. The Government could have
readily found local authorities to take this
amount at 5 per cent, at least, and on quite
as good security. As every increase of debt
tends to lessen credit, the Govt., therefore,
weakened the credit of the province, not only
without drawing advantage from the loan, bub
even sacrificing its advantage to the necessities
of the bank—which, of course, lends at its dis-
count and overdraft rates of, say, 7 and 8 per
cent., the money borrowed on the credit
of the people, for which it pays per cent.
Now, who is the bank? A list filed at Q.
Supreme Court, on Feb. 28, 1894, contains the
names of 21 members of the Q. Legislature,
who were then shareholders of the Q.N. Bank.
Now, a wise provision of Parliamentary law
prevents any member from taking a contract or
office of profit under Parliament, unless in the
work of administration. Does it follow, then
that those members of the Queensland Legisla-
ture who are also shareholders of the Queens-
land National Bank would betray their public
trust if they influenced or consented to or re-
frained from opposing arrangements by which
the public funds might be used for the profit of
that bank ? Certainly not. Does it follow
that they are using their Parliamentary posi-
tions to the disadvantage of the taxpayers?
Certainly not. Does it follow that the finances
of Queensland are improperly administered by
a set of politicians for their own benefit?
Certainly not. To misquote Sheridan : “ The
Queensland Parliament is a family of great
versatility and uncommon honesty, and the
Q.N. Bank may be personified as a lady beauti-
ful in person, modest in her deportment, refined
in her sentiments, and of nice morality, split
my windpipe !”
The Artful Property-Tax.
Out of Melbourne’s chief Tory mouthpiece
comes a simple proposal to enforce direct taxa-
tion in Victoria in a way that would lead to the
largest possible amount of dissatisfaction. “If
stop-gap (!) taxation is to be imposed, we must
reiterate the belief that it would be better to
go to property than to income,” says the Argus.
After reiterating most of the Tory fictions con-
cerning the alleged difficulty in taxing personal
profits, the organ comes to the point that “ the
property-tax would cover a far wider area than
a restricted income-tax, and would excite much
less of class feeling.” In short, the property
impost would fall upon so many struggling agri-
culturists and impecunious owners of small
weatherboard cottages, and be met with so
many protests of inability to pay it from work-
ing-men out of billets, that the Argus might
presently describe a good principle as something
that had been put into practice and found bad.
Times out of number Capital has called atten-
tion to the happy state of the labouring land-
lord, and instanced his possession of property
as a proof that he had no excuse for
going on strike. But Capital no longer
begrudges the unemployed bricklayer his
dilapidated cottage and few square feet of
soil, seeing that the aforesaid properties may
serve to unite the classes and the masses in one
common complaint against the “injustice” of
direct taxation. Poverty may be Wealth’s
catspaw for pulling its sovereigns out of the
Treasurer’s fire. “By property, of course , we
mean not real estate simply and merely, but
property of any and every description—wealth
in all its realised forms,” says the Argus. Now,
the poor man’s own house and the few miser-
able sticks therein are the chief items of realised
wmalth that escape the income-tax obligation.
A prosperity, not a property-tax, is the matter
which Fat Man wishes to avoid, and prosperity
is represented by the financial income. The
unfairness of a property-tax suggestion is
beautifully expressed in the thought that it
“ would cover a far wider area thana restricted .
income-tax.” It would be no tax at all upon
the high-salaried civil servant whose extra-
vagance preserves him from property, and who
would be very justly reached by an income-tax.
But it would be a scandalous imposition upon
thousands of people whose incomes are little or
nothing per annum, and would result in the
political failure that the Argus clan is anxious
to bring about. There is no deceptive ring
about the words property - tax. They are
pleasant to democratic ears, for “ proputty ” is
associated with prosperity, unearned increment,
high living, and invitations to banquet at the
public expense. Whereas a representative
gaudy financier might spend every year
thousands of income money without contri-
buting a penny to the tax that pressed upon a
hundred of his poorly-paid employes.
A Question of Privilege.
One afternoon last week a tall parson was
summoned to the bar of the Victorian Legisla-
tive Assembly to justify a piece of one of his
sermons. The stalwart shepherd had men-
tioned from the pulpit that disgraceful indivi-
duals made their way into Parliaments and
were prepared to do anything mean and con-
temptible when they got there. A newspaper
report represented the gentleman as using the
words “ liars and profligates.” Clearly he had
said something derogatory to the dignity of the
’Ouse, and sb he was called to the bar for the
purpose of being bluffed, if possible, into a
recantation. Only a few members wished to
move in this dangerous matter at the outset.
By the time the parson was actually on the
spot the desire to demand an apology was
limited to a very select circle indeed, but the
gentleman having been summoned to the bar, it
was necessary to do something other than ask
him to take a drink. Therefore, Speaker
Thomas Bent read aloud to the parson the
newspaper report complained of, and asked him
if the report was correct. The parson replied
“It is not quite accurate,” and with that
Speaker Bent would fain have closed the pro-
ceedings. Bent, for his part, was perfectly
satisfied to know that the parson’s words were
not quite accurately taken down. He didn’t
enquire as to whether the real original sentence
had been hotter or milder than it appeared in
print. The parson might have said “ accursed
liars and profligates,” but it was all the same
to the Speaker as long as the report happened
to be incorrect in any particular. In fact,
Speaker Bent plainly showed that he was not
in favor of making the parson explain himself,
Also, Premier Patterson and other experienced
tacticians tried to get the House quit of the
accuser on the cheapest possible terms. After
a ludicrous wrangle, however, a section of the
Assembly managed to carry its point that the
parson must be called upon to say something
definite. Truly a great opportunity for a
reverend person who loves notoriety and is in
his own showing anxious to raise the moral
tone of the Legislature. Yet he didn’t say any-
thing definite. He read an indefinite statement
which spread his accusation over parliaments
in general, and repudiated the idea that he had
been thinking of the Vic. Assembly in parti-
cular. His statement finished thus —“ I was
thinking at the time, I may say, of such in-


stances as Jabez Balfour and cases like that ,
and of the financial frauds disclosed amongst
members of Parliament in Canada and in the
Panama scandals. With such instances as these
impressed upon my mind, I said that scoundrels
and blacklegs were too often returned to Par-
liament, not ‘liars and profligates,’ as reported.
That is all I have to say,” From which The,
Bulletin concludes that the shepherd’s pluck
was not fully equal to the emergency, nor was
his heart as faint as the House would have
liked to find it. He was allowed to retire with-
out cross-examination, and the Vic. Assembly,
having succeeded in making a profound ass of
itself, went on to the next business on the
paper. The incident was satisfactory, insofar
that it silenced the “ respectable ” brigade who
have found a pleasure in supporting the fiction
that no man dare impugn the honor of Parliament
at its own awful bar. Parliament, in this case,
was compelled to swallow a mild pill in the form
of a suggestion that “scoundrels and blacklegs”
are often returned at the top of the poll. Un-
happily, there was not sufficient grit in the
cushion-puncher to achieve a bolder result. He
might have localised the Jabez Balfour case,
and given the “ blackleg” term a more forcible
application. The Victorian Assembly recog-
nised this glorious possibility by letting the
gentleman depart in peace. As men of the
world, the members were entitled to argue that
lying is inseparable from modern politics, whilst
personal profligacy is not incompatible with
public honesty ox even with sturdy patriotism.
They couldn’t find a political defence for finan-
cial impurity in the abstract, or deny its exist-
ence within the sacred walls of the ’Ouse. The
one great sin of a soiled Senate has found it
out, and the huge, vague parson may continue
to work that fact for all he is worth. Privi-
leged abuses breed privileged abuse.
*
People’s Banks.
Mr. B. R. Wise, of Sydney, recently struck a
new remedy for the ever-present depression,
said remedy being the establishment of
“ People’s Banks,” after the fashion of those
now existing in Germany and Italy. The
People’s Bank, as it exists in those countries,
is a purely co-operative affair which lends
money to the agricultural classes at the
minimum rate of interest, and mainly on per-
sonal security. Each bank works within a
certain narrow radius. Inside its own little
circle it knows everybody, and estimates its
security by that personal knowledge. The
amounts lent are mostly small, but among a
poor population, and in a land where the cost
of living is very low, it is an inestimable benefit,
and its losses are so limited as to be
practically nil. The experiment of lending
money to the poorest class of the population,
on personal security, and at lowest current rate
U interest —the same rate which is commonly
charged on gilt-edged securities—looks reckless
inough, but after a trial of many years its
mccess has been sufficiently demonstrated.
Therefore, Mr. B. R. Wise, who is essentially a
man of book-knowledge and slow to learn by
personal observation, wants to establish
People’s Banks all over Australia, and produce
the same blessed result. He reasons that as
these institutions have succeeded in Continental
Europe they must succeed here, just as he
reasons that because Freetrade exists in England
it ought to exist here. But to any man except
the slavish copyist, it is sufficiently obvious
that the People’s Bank, if transplanted to Aus-
tralia, would be a ghastly and utter failure.
All the circumstances which have made it a
success elsewhere are wanting. The first
requirement is a stationary population—a popu-
lation which has fixed itself in its hereditary
village for centuries, so that the bank can
lend not only on the personal character of
its client, but on the character of his father
and his grandfather, and all the rest of his
family, and so that it can feel quite sure of
finding its debtor in the same old thatched
cottage when it wants him, even should it be
20 years hence or more. And the next essential
is a penurious population of the kind which
saves up pennies and half-pennies, and invests
its microscopic savings carefully, so as to
furnish the capital with which to run
the People’s Bank. But, in Australia,
with its migratory population, most of
which never had any available grandfather and
never stayed long enough in one place to estab-
lish a character which any bank would lend
money upon, and with its tendency to put its
small savings on the Melbourne Cup, and its
whole-souled contempt for the loan of 50s. which
is the staple transaction of the People’s Bank,
and its utter want of all the plodding charac-
teristics of the German or Italian peasant, the
experiment is hopeless. The People’s Banks
were built to suit a particular kind of humanity,
and they will suit no other variety. They
grow in their own especial soil, and can’t bear
transplantation.

,§.A. Register (Aug. 16), in a leading article
comments on the decision of the Ministry to hang
Brown, the Lovely Gully murderer. The man
Page, referred to, who shot his sweetheart at
Port Lincoln last year, was defended by Premier
Kingston, Q.C., and sentenced to death, but
spared by the Executive :
It is incomprehensible, except upon a sadly uncom-
plimentary hypothesis, how practically the same Ministers
could pardon Page and yet show no clemency to Brown.
But we welcome their latest action as a sign of their in-
tention to be just now if they never were before. We
welcome it the more particularly because if they had
dared many times more to outrage the public sense of
oght, as they did so shamelessly in the case of the Port
Lincoln murderer, they would have been the means of in-
troducing Lynch law into South Australia.
Ihe Register, then, can see no difference
between a murder madly committed under the
influence of jealousy or disappointed love, and
a murder done in apparent cold-blood, as in the
case of Brown, for the sake of gain 1 As to
the Register’s suggestion of Lynch law it may
>e here remarked that the public when in its
sober senses, in most cases, does not desire blood
mt is usually quite satisfied with more or less
extreme punishment short of death. It is a
poor judgment which will not stand the test of
Slx months’ consideration, yet who will dare to
Sil y that were murderers kept alive in gaol six
months after conviction public sentiment would
“ ofc » * u most cases, overwhelmingly favour their
reprieve? Taking recent cases, Page would
mot, under such circumstances, be hanged, nor
would Jordan, the negro butchered the other
day. Nor would any man or woman be executed
whose crime was the outcome of passion or
drink, and not of mercenary calculation.
Nicholls and Lester, who assassinated poor
workmen for the sake of their clothes and
silver watches, would be hanged with enthusi-
asm even if they were kept in gaol 25 years ;
but Montgomery and Williams would not be
hanged if their case had now to be calmly con-
sidered. The Register allows its Bakerian
detestation of Premier Kingston to get the
better of its judgment.

The new rule, which fixes a very narrow time
limit to the speech of Maoriland politicians,
worked well in the budget debate. Out of 72
members no less than 54 had their say on
the subject, and among them they said about
every thing which could be said, and a good
many other things besides. Yet the debate
was finished in a week, instead of dragging
over a month as it would have certainly done
under the old system. Nobody is ever con-
verted by Parliamentary speeches ; when the
longestdebate on record is finished the vote is just
the same as if there had been no debate at all.
The principal objects of a long debate are to
advertise the bores of the House with a view to
next election ; to enable certain persons of the
kind who must talk or burst (there are such
persons, just as there are persons who must
play Juliet or burst) to get their undigested
eloquence off their chests; to give time for
lobbying and buying votes ; and to tire out the
other side and snatch a division when the
weakly members have collapsed through sheer
weariness and gone home. And as none of
these things do any good to the country, the
rule which condenses every voluble bore into
30 minutes is a blessed innovation. Even
Shiels might have been a man of point and
brevity if he had been smitten by such a rule
in his extreme youth.
+ — :
Chief Justice Madden’s sermons are not to
be laughed at when there is an embezzler in
the case. The truth is beautiful and pure, not-
withstanding that it promptly gets lost in the
Smellbourne financial stink. Hear Dr. Madden
to a “respectable” criminal; “You are one
more of the extremely long line of regretable
cases which assert themselves with alarming
persistency, cases which are extremely
dangerous to the community. It has been
shown that in most of the good qualities of men
you are exemplary, and had succeeded in estab-
lishing yourself in the position of trust and
confidence with those with whom you were
associated, but, singular and paradoxical as it
may seem, that is almost the invariable
condition of the offender in these cases.
People do not get into a position of trust
until they have established confidence in other
people, and these cases show that there is no
security to the community from the instinctive
honor of men who have been honorable up to
that time. On perhaps strong provocation they
have abandoned the principles of a lifetime,
and this breaks up all trust and confidence in
commercial affairs in commercial confidence,
which are inseparable from the career of a
successful community.” Dr. Madden, preaching
that confidence is broken up, and stating why it
broke, is a deal better than Premier Patterson
swearing that confidence was only a little sick,
and is now restored to health again. Unfor-
tunately, the waxed-moustachio’s sermons are
not addressed to the men who debauched the
embezzlers with their dangerous example of
“ fraud without punishment.”
Robert Stout, the teetotal fanatic, of Maori-
land, still gets up at intervals to declare wail-
fully that Ballance, when on his death-bed,
bequeathed him the leadership of the Demo-
cratic party, and that Seddon brutally and
aggressively jumped the billet. The Bulletin
doesn’t like Seddon any too much, but it likes
him better than Stout, for the reason that
Stout is a K.C.M.G. already, while Seddon is
only thinking of becoming one. Moreover, it
objects to Stout because he was Vogel’s
accomplice, because of his attempts to break up
the Democratic party, because of his awful
land-grant railway, and still more because
he publicly wept tears of joy over his
bauble, when he heard that he had fallen
into a knighthood. Also his dismal sobbing
over his alleged claims to the Premiership is
very wearisome, and his story is too thin to be
believed by any grown up person of reasonable
intelligence. The idea that Ballance, who was
about the brainiest Democrat in Australasia,
should have professed to give away his billet to
a successor appointed by himself, as if it was a
piece of private property, is absurd ; and the
idea that Stout, lawyer and KjO.M.G., should,
of all men, have been that successor, is equally
absurd. There is a soft and unreliable streak
in Robert Stout which unfits him for leader-
ship, and Ballance knew it as well as any-
body.
«.
The June elections to the Parliament of Ontario,
the core of the Canadian Confederacy, were the
most remarkable ever held in the province. In
the Dominion Parliament the Conservatives are
in power as high-tariff Protectionists. In
Ontario, the Liberal party, composed of mode-
rate Protectionists with a good sprinkling of
Freetraders, has always been supreme. The
recent elections only settled them more firmly
in power. But a new political factor has arisen
in the shape of the Patrons of Industry, an
association of farmers disgusted with Protec-
tion, and advocating reform in all directions.
These have only been organising for two or
three years, yet they elected 16 members in a
House of 94 ; the Liberals being credited with
49, and the Conservatives with 27. To Ontario
and Canada, this irruption of free-trading
radicals is even more startling than the onset
of Labor into the New South Wales Parliament
seemed to the old parties in 1891. The Patrons
came in on the sole ground of reform ; the
strife between Liberals and Conservatives was
dominated by t he sectarian issue. Thanks to
the opposition between French Catholics and
English Protestants, nourished by the separate-
school system, religious animosity rages in
Canada with extraordinary virulence. The
Ontario Conservatives joined hands with the
Protestant Protective Association, which reaches
the acme of bigotry in proposing to endow
Protestantism with public funds and disendow
Catholicism altogether. The result was that
Ontario Catholics wei’e thrown into the arms of
the Liberals and contributed largely to the
Liberal victory.
The pan-colonial conference in Canada has
given a pleasant picnic, at tax-payers’ expense,
to a score of pleasant gentlemen; and it has
done nothing else. The object of the Canadian
promoters was to boom preferential trade
relations within the British empire, in the hope
that at next general elections Canadian tariff
reformers—steadily growing in numbers and
importance, and defrauded of their best
and natural trade with the U.S.—might be
persuaded to take the shadow instead of the
substance. When England—which cannot give
trade-preferences to Australia or Canada or
the Cape without embroiling herself in Europe
—sent Lord J ersey as a mere spectator, she
uttered the doom of the conference. When
Queensland, New South Wales, and Maoriland,
through their delegates, opposed the proposi-
tions for preferential trade they executed the
sentence. Nobody anticipated any better
result. In Canada itself the conference was
chiefly noticed to be scoffed at; and the
Farmers’ Sun, the organ of Ontario democrats,
remarked that the projected deep canal from
Montreal to Toronto was of infinitely greater
importance than its “visionary proposals.” All
that remains is to foot the bills of Suttor,
Thynne, Fraser, Smith and Co., and yearn
for the time when Australia will be governed
by men with sense and principle enough not to
waste the people’s money wantonly.
A controversy about the sinfulness of cards,
dancing, and theatre-going has, for some weeks
past, been raging furiously in Sydney Tele-
graph. A lot of interesting correspondents
have howled dismally on various aspects of the
subject, about the most interesting of the crowd
being “ A Christian Mother,” who demands, in
a .terrible tone of voice: “Can we imagine
Peter, James, and John, with their Divine
Lord, sitting down to a game of w'hist, or Paul
dancing ?” Obviously no one can imagine such
a thing, and, therefore, the “Christian
Mother” retires triumphant, and the sinfulness
of theatres, dancing, and card-playing is fully
demonstrated. But when one seriously con-
siders the matter, the evidence doesn’t look
quite so conclusive. No one can seriously
imagine one of the aforesaid Apostles wearing
a black tail coat and a stove-pipe hat,
for instance, or writing to the Daily
Telegraph, or having his hair brushed by
steam - power, or travelling in a tram or
a steamer, or getting a Turkish bath, or
being vaccinated, or keeping a dog, or eating
barracoota, or doing several billion other
things. The Apostle, as he is viewed through
the haze of 19 centuries, seems to have been
a person who lived nohow in particular,
had no visible means of support, was
always tramping excitedly from place to place,
had no fixed church or habitation, was dressed
principally in a long, high-coloured wrap, and
lived in a constant state of hysterical exalta-
tion. The modern “ Christian Mother” is so
fond of picturing her apostle in this misty and
frantic condition that she can’t even realise the
poor man as having had his pants mended in
an ordinary every-day fashion; and when the
sinfulness of any modern amusement is dis-
cussed she always points out that some apostle
or other wouldn’t have done it, and thereby
settles the question at once. The real fact
being that nobody, at this distance of time, can
seriously realise that an apostle ever did any-
thing except preach and work miracles, so that,
according to the “Christian Mother” kind of
logic, these are the only legitimate occupations
left to us.

Dear Bulletin, —I contend that the Q. Sugar
Acl, equitably administered, will make the
fortunes of hundreds of struggling farmers. Is
it equitably administered ? Let the history of
the circs, under which the Kelly’s Camp Co.
was prevented from getting the Government
guarantee supply the answer. The Kelly’s
Camp crowd (Isis Scrub, Bundaberg district)
formed a company ; and the Govt, employed
one A. B. Jones to value the land. Jones
is a man of long experience in the work, and
claims that he gave an appraisement something
below the full value. Cran and Co. own a mill
in the near vicinity, and they object to a co-
operative mill because it is competitive, and
possibly also because it will determine by results
the true value of the cane. At present Cran
and Co. give 3s. to 6s. a ton. The Mackay
Co-op. mills give 12s. 6d. to 14s. Density
accounts for a good deal of difference. Do you
see now where the Cran shoe pinches? There-
fore, somebody (was it the Grans?) got up a dis-
cussion in the papers about the right of Govt,
to lend money at 5 per cent, to enable co-op.
mills to compete with capitalist mills built
with money costing 8 per cent. To block the
‘Kelly’s Camp crowd somebody (was it Cran?)
took a trip to Brisbane and had an inter-
view with Minister Philp. Evidently somebody
(? a Cran) told Philp the land had been over-
valued by Jones, and got Govt, to get it re-
valued by somebody else—who happens to have
been formerly connected with the sugar busi-
ness. The new valuation was less than half
Jones’, and Philp has refused the guarantee,
telling a recent deputation that “ he had been
assured (by whom ?) that there was sufficient
mill accommodation already.” So things stand.
Between the upper millstone of bank monopoly
and the nether one of private monopoly indus-
try in this province is ground mighty small
nowadays. And it deserves it. The asses who
went and voted for “ strong man ” MTlwraith
have only themselves to thank for their kicking.
—Yours, VVurry M.
Instead of the usual annual increases, New
South Wales public-school returns, just pub-
lished, show a falling-off for the year, as com-
pared with the preceding 12 months, both in
the average attendance and enrolment of
scholars between the ages of six and fourteen
years inclusive. Also, during the latter half-
year of the returns many more pupils failed to
complete the regulation minimum attendance
than during the first half-year, which period,
compared again with the preceding six months,
also shows an increased non-attendance—“ the
depression,” of course, being solely responsible
for the foregoing. To check the increasing
tendency of parents to take their children from
school, and put them to w’ork, before attaining
the prescribed age, the Education authorities
have found it necessary to raise the standard of
the examination required to be passed by pupils
who wish to leave school before reaching the
age of 14. The examination is so stiff now that
scholars who have passed their junior exam,
have lately been known to fail to negotiate this
examination. The check is not altogether an
unnecessary one, for no child should, if possible,
be allowed to be sent out into the world under
the age of 14.

A slab of Foreign-trade wisdom from Melb.
Argus :
And to whom are the men to sell the produce they raise
from the land ? They must sell abroad. And what will
these men obtain for their produce ? They will obtain
commodities. Their customers abroad can only pay in
commodities for the produce. Surely the customers who
buy our produce should be allowed to send as much in
return in commodities as possible. The High Tariff oartv
say “ No.” r
It is about time someone contradicted this old
wheeze about “commodities.” Australia has
exported in 30 years about .£300,000,000 of
gold, in order to pay people who want cash
instead of commodities. Britain has exported,
in 30 years, £380,000,000 in gold, and imported
£447,000,000; Francehasimported £403,000,000
and exported £276,000,000 ; and other countries
have done, and are constantly doing, likewise,
for the same reason. It is estimated that there
are in the whole world about £1,235,000,000 in
gold coin and bullion, and about the same amount
in silver, and this stupendous mass of mineral is
constantly being humped round the earth, and
shipped in great boxes to the furthest ends of the
globe to pay for produce purchased which the
seller won’t take out in commodities. More-
over, the Argus logic bursts up right on its own
doorstep. Victoria in ’92 exported nearly
£1,000,000 worth to France, and got back
£60,000 worth, and the theory that payment is
made in commodities is thus 94 per cent. out.
In the same year it imported from Canada to
the value of £42,000, and sent back absolutely
nothing except cash; therefore, in this instance,
the ancient Freetrade wheeze is just 100 per
cent, bunkum. The simple fact is that every
country buys and sells where it can, and is con-
stantly importing and exporting great masses of
gold and silver in payment, and the commodity
idea is only a figure of speech, and not much of
one at that.

“Lady Cook” seems to have raised some
curiosity in dull old-world minds, and Aus-
tralian editors have rushed to quote her views,
by propounding the conundrum—“ Should the
Poor Marry ?” Why “ the poor ” only should
be selected doesn’t seem to strike anybody as
worth questioning. Should the poor sleep ?
Should the poor eat ? What has marriage —as
marriage—as a purely sexual coupling—to do
with poverty ? Should birds mate ? Are “ the
poor ” different in sexual functions to “ the
rich?” Parody Shylock’s complaint and apply
it to this subject. “Should the poor marry ?”
is about the most senseless question propounded
during this Jin de siecle. Should anybody
marry ? And Lady Cook declares this law

tastes, or if they are deficient in energy and business
aptitudes, or even in moral principles, then they had far
better remain single.
Very well, then. If they do remain technically
single, what then? This needs plain talk—
unvarnished, realistic thought. Has marriage
—as marriage, and not as a branch of commerce
or religion—anything whatever to do with
incomes, or extravagance, or deficiency in busi-
ness aptitude and energy, or loose morals ?
Bluntly : Marriage is the civilised symbol of
the universal instinct of the procreation of the
species. Rob the poor, or any other class, of
marriage, and you foster !
Max O’Rell gives a foretaste of what is going
to happen to Australia in his forthcoming book.
In a French magazine he says that the lord
and master of Australia is the working-man,
who will neither profit by his opportunities nor
let others profit. The Australian working-
man is lazy, drunken, a sieve—thinking only
of himself, and nothing of his country. He
idles in the towns, while the land cries for
labour. Finally, he ought to imitate the China-
jpan whom he despises. Of course, this is only
a bare extract ; but if it fairly represents the
article, and if the article fairly represents the
book, Australia can only add Max O’Rell to
the innumerable company who have enjoyed her
freedom, and her sunshine, and her hospitality*
and then gone away bo libel her. Max O’Rell
saw only a corner of Australia, and even of
that corner it is impossible to generalise with-
out many drawbacks and reservations. As his
words now stand they are in the main untrue.
On the whole, the Australian working-man is
neither lazy nor drunken ; he is a sieve—if that
means careless and improvident; he does stay
in the towns and pray to Government for
work, while the country goes untilled ; the
Chinaman can teach him something in
the way of patient industry. But, never-
theless, Max O’Rell’s language gives a
false impression. With all his faults, the Aus-
tralian working-man is as good a specimen as
there is going. We would not change him for
the French or English peasant-slave or factory-
drudge—nor the best of him even for the ener-
getic American. For in morality and intelli-
gence he stands as high as any others of his
class, and higher than most. He has large
virtues to compensate small vices. If thrift-
less, he is generous ; if deficient in energy and
initiative for himself, he has zeal and sympathy
for others. He degenerates in the cities ; but
you must average him to know him. See him
in the bush, see him on the mines. The
Bulletin would pit the first ten thousand met
around Coolgardie against any workers in the
world—not as beasts of burden, not as money-
makers, not as saints, but as men.

The Bank of Victoria shows a profit for the
past half-year of £29,921, and spends £28,339 in paying a
o per cent. div. The balance, which amounts to £1582,
goes to strengthen the position of the bank. Considering
all the possibilities that lie before a bank in these times,
this “strengthening” process is a ghastly joke. If the
Victoria would be content to pay 5 per oent. on its pre-
ference shares and reduce the div. on ordinary shares to
2J, it would be able to add about £20,000 per annum to
its reserve, which is little enough in a province where
“securities" have gone down into an abyss of deprecia-
tion, and no bottom is yet visible. And if it would pass
the div. on ordinary shares altogether, and carry £40,000
a year to reserve for the next three years, it would be
none too much, considering all the chances in the way of
depreciation which are yet ahead. The Bank of Victoria
has splendid possibilities, which are being steadily fooled
away in the frantic desire to pay divs. Meanwhile, the
£lO preference shares are selling at about £6, and the
ordinary shares have long since practically vanished out
of the exchange quotations, so the 5 per cent, dividend
hasn’t even the humble virtue of inspiring confidence.
• • • *
The Bank of Victoria, like all the rest, has been
seized with the mania for huge cash balances. Before re-
construction it kept about 1J millions on hand in a more
or less liquid form ; now that its depositors have been so
securely fixed that it can’t be rushed under any possible
circumstances, it keeps a cash balance of nearly 1J
millions. At least half this amount ought to be used at
once to pay off reconstructed depositors, and if the
depositors choose to renew at a lower rate of interest, as
many of them probably would, so much the better for the
institution, Just now almost every bank is remorselessly
squeezing gord customers, and "selling them up, and
wrecking good business, in order to swell its cash on
hand, and to show how securely the stable door has been
locked and barricaded after the horse is gone. The chief
business of a bank director these times seems to be to
gaze, with an aspect of fatuous joy, at an inflated money-
bag in the cellar, and report half-yearly on the increased
bulging thereof.
• • • •
Now that the awful burden of the 4$ per cent,
interest on reconswlndled deposits is beginning to be felt
in real earnest, many banking potentates would gladly sand-
bag or otherwise injure the once great Gyles Turner,
of the Commercial of Australia. That magnate decided
that it was neceswy to offer 4J per cent., and so great
was his reputation that every other bank, save the
E.S. and A.U., followed his example without question.
The solitary exception reconstructed mainly on a 4 per
cent, basis. To a hank with, say, £4,000,000 of deposits,
thatjp r cent, makes a difference of just £20,000 per
annum, which, in the case of an institution with a capital
of £500,000, means a dividend of 2J per cent, gratuitously
fooled away.

Matthias Larkin, the saint of the South Melh.
Building Society, was tried last week for another big
embezzlement of £3399, and sentenced to five years’ gaol.
This term, added to the six years he is already'serving,
makes eleven. Matthias was also tried on two more
chargi s, and was found not guilty; hut when the prose-
cution gets fully rested it will probably start afresh on a
few more oases, so that Mr. Larkin has great possibilities
before him. In Ins own humble way, the ex-hoss of the
South Melb. Building Society is now the most useful man
in Victoria. Whenever the public has doubts about the
purity of Victorian justice, and is indignant at the immu-
nity enjoyed by a few dozen conspicuous boom criminals,
the law rises un in its might and starts another prosecu-
tion against Mat. Lai kin, and to all appearance it will
continue doing so as long as that eminent saint lasts.
M itt.hias’ eleven years are not by any means too much
tor his frauds, hut if there are only eleven years' gaol
going it ought to be more equally divided.
Tn passing sentence on Brother Larkin, Judge
Midden informed that brassy apostle that ‘‘in the evil
history of an evil time his conduct stood out as a monu-
ment of woe to multitudes of people. He had been re-
sponsible for bringing down a storehouse of the savingsof
the people, and neither helplessness nor poverty had
stayed his depredating hand.” All of which is doubtless
true, hut so many other and bigger storehouses came
down, and so many other persons took the coin with a
depredating hand, and then went away on depredating
feet and were never troubled by any inquiries, that it
se' ins a pity Mat. Larkin should have all the eloquence to
himself.

When it transpired in the Victorian bankruptcy
court that ex-Speaker Davies had only £BO, and the
white flower of a blameless life wherewith to satisfy
liabilities of £281,000, Judge Molesworth, who evidently
regarded the aforesaid blossom as insufficient security,
decided to insist on the statutory payment of 7s. in the
£, and refused a certificate accordingly. But he thought-
fully pointed out that if the bankrupt felt aggrieved at
this decision, he could appeal to the Supreme Court to
have it revers-d. And Matthew D. does feel aggrieved,
and will probably take the hint, and will most likely get
his certificate in due course. Meanwhile, the general
opinion, in the highest land-boom circles, is that Judge
Molesworth is a low character,

Melb. Argus, in the course of a bitter attack
on the proposed State Bank, remarks: “In May, last
year, the Vic. bank-note system was exposed to a hurri-
cane trial, and it emerged without injury from a strain
under which the Canadian and American systems would
assuredly have broken down.” Considering that the bank-
note system “ emerged ” simply because the banks
annexed the depositors’ money and paid the note-holders
with it, the above is cast-iron front in its best state of
development.

It is only within the past six months that
certain Southern banks have “tumbled” to the fact that
the bill-clerk is one of the most important factors in the
banking community. As bankers now rely on di-count
accounts for a profit, a customer who cannot secure an
overdraft on ordinary securities can get any limit on dis-
count overdraft. A few cute traders having “dropped"
to the idea have got “discounting overdrafts” to amounts
ridiculously out of proportion to their capital, and it is
only now that two banks have ascertained that numbers
of their customers have regularly discounted the paper of
hopelessly insolvent customers month after month and
have thus got overdrafts for from five to ten times the
amount that either their stock, hook-debts, or property
warranted. The bill-clerks recently appointed by the
most heavily-struck banks, in this respect, are getting
salaries equal to the sub-managers.

When one official of a big Australian concern
unlawfully annexes a hundred or two and gets a long

as to the reason of that official having suddenly dis-
appeared. The smaller embezzler’s peculation is made
public, apparently, to let shareholders believe that th e
directorate is wide-awake, but the greater tinner’s is kept
dark—not (as many people suppose) to prevent a fall In
shares, but to enable those In the know to buy in, it
being now well-esta' lished that at least £lO,OOO that

appropriated during the past 16 months.

In Melb. Insolvency Court, the other day,
Judge Molesworth ordered certain parties to pay a dis-
puted amount of £137 into an insolvent estate, and
furthermore ordered those parties to pay the trustee's
costs in the action. The trustee’s solicitor made out a
little bill for £239, being costs incurred by the victor in
the struggle over £137, subject, of course, to more or less
reduction by the usual taxing officer. Fearful lest the
taxing officer should not reduce the bill verv considerably
the parties aforesaid applied to Judge Molesworth for
relief. They begged him to fix a fair amount of costs to
be paid along with the £137. His Honor fixed them at
£3l 10s., or less than one-tenth of the amount charged by
the trustee’s solicitor. Question —Will the unhappy
estate be victimised for the difference between £3l 10s.
and t’239, or will the Law which protected the individuals
come to the rescue of the estate ? Does anybody ever
come to the rescue of an insolvent estate?

for several hundreds endorsed by a man who left
Australia just after the bills were discounted. The
lender was nonsuited, on the defence set up by the maker
that his signature was a forgery ; he, moreover, denied
all knowledge of the bills or their proceeds. The alleged

a fugitive from justice) turned up again the other day,
and the first man he called on was the lender, to learn “ if
those bills had been met all right?” Then it came out
that the endorser had only gone to England to receive a

to part handsomely to square matters up.

Developments at the Central (8.H.) to which
are due the resumption of smelting and consequent rise
in shares, would, four years ago, have sent the exchanges
wild and caused a rise of more pounds than shares have
now risen shillings. The developments at and below the
600 ft. level are the most valuable of the year at Broken
Hill.
The long-standing feud between the Melb. and
S.A. directors of the Central will probably continue until
the office, and with it the practical boss-ship of the
mine, is removed to Adelaide. At present, the
Adelaide directors, being in a minority, may only fume
and make recommendations, which the Melb. crowd
ignore. The maintenance of the divided board is profit-
able to the directors, but decidedly expensive to the
shareholders.
Melb. directors of the Central have been
credited with a desire to maintain the system of disposing
of the mine’s output to the Dry Creek Smelting Co.
Chaffey Baker, Adelaide director and chief advocate of
local smelting, discussing the subject with a Broken Hill
interviewer, said that the Melb. board preferred managing
the office in Queen-street to managing the mine. Whereat
more trouble between the two directorates.
Proposals to re-open B.H. South mine are based
on the disposal abroad at alleged satisfactory rates of the
whole of the sulphide concentrates produced by the Han-
cock jigs at the mine before the stoppage. The erection
of another jig and economies in working are proposed
which will, it is said, reduce the cost of concentration by
ss. per ton. There is now a permanent market for the
concentrates which, unfortunately, the South people have
not yet shown they are able to produce at or below the
price obtained for them. Wherefore, despite the promised
economies the prospects from re-starting are not so
enticing as they might be. It is certain that operations,
prior to the stoppage, resulted in a slight loss for every
ton of ore concentrated.
Proprietary assisfcant-general-manager Stewart
from Spain, who arrived in Adelaide early this month
and was met there by gen.-manager Howell, went on a
trip to Tasmania before starting work at Broken Hill. It
is alleged that Howell, who had no voice in the selection
of the new man, who will practically be manager of the
Proprietary, looks at him in advance with a cold eye.
The ranch-lauded Junction North has fallen on
evil days, and the sudden depletion of its rich sandstone,
coincident with the silver fall, rendered leaching opera-
tions unprofitable. Recently a contract was arranged for
the mining and treatment of sulphide, of which the mine
possesses a fair quantity, on royalty, but the operations
were a failure, as at least several people can depose. The
mine is now raising what rich sandstone it can find—
which is little—and hopes to sell it at a profit.

Many “wonderful developments” from Wya-
long, and no crushings save 10-ton driblets. And where
are the other batteries that were to go up? Isn’t there
enough stone ?
One correspondent says Wyalong hasn’t pro-
duced 2000 oz. gold in all—about equal to the monthly
yield of each of several Far Northern claims. There are
no authoritative figures; but even putting the total at
40000 z., it’s not a brilliant return for, say, six months’
work for, say, 1000 men.
Things at Wyalong are just this way : there’s a
good deal of gold in rich mnllocky leaders which may
average 6in. all round. Country soft, and no explosives
needed. But there are no properly defined reefs in Wya-
long proper, and what will become of those leaders when
they reach solid rock, any miner can guess.
But, supposing they do last, and pay to work,
it is plain the gold can’t be worked profitably from a
hundred pot-hole shafts on as many prospecting areas—
where you’ve no sooner started to drive than you’re up
to the other fellow’s boundary. It doesn’t pay to put up
machinery to work that sort of reef at a depth.' Now I hat
the surface stuff has been pretty well tumbled over, it’s

£4,000,000 went to the promoters and vendors! . . .

The time will soon come when suspicion will be

capital. When the investors have been allotted this per-
centage, the vendors and promoters will get the same, if
it is there, and the surplus, if any, will be shared all

For Titanic impudence commend ns to the
“Pearce prospecting party” crowd. The man who
wants to float a prospect is one thing, but the man
who wants to float the prospect of a prospect is a
multitude in himself. One Pearce, of Westralia (not
John Pearce, who lately managed the N.S.W. Golden
Gully), wants camels to go prospecting. Certain bene-
factors of their race propose to float Pearce and his
camels into a No Liability Co., in which they will retain
110 fuily-paid-up shares, 500 contributing shares (£5 each)
being offered to the innocent public. The said pro-
moter-benefactors are named in an Arous advt., and
to their names is added “and others.” “And
others ” is delicious. There is a non-issue of 390
shares! “These being held in reserve for future issue
will form a splendid reserve-fund, as they will no doubt
greatly increase in value as discoveries are made.” Why
did they not make the non-issue 390,000,000 shares’
The splendid reserve would then have been a million
times splendider. But, after all. why should the public
contribute £2500 to share possible divs. with a parcel of
promoters who apparently risk nothing but their reputa-
tions in the concern ?
In striking contrast to the “ Pearce Co.” is the
party proposed to be equipped and officered from Ballarat.
The prospectors will receive expenses and no salary—
their discoveries will be remunerated by shares in the 00.
which has franked them. There are no shares issued as
paid-up, or other monstrosities. The capital is to be

the other day to establish a prospecting association, and
his scheme bids well for success. £5O per week is to be
raised from 1000 contributing shares at Is. each, and the
large unexplored areas round the original Golden City
are to be systematically examined. A big improvement

When the City of Glasgow Bank made its his-
toric burst in the latter Seventies, one of the items which
came under the astonished eye of the liquidator was an
advance of £90,000 to an alleged “ dairy farmer.” The
official went out to view this copious borrower, and to
have a look at the security, and estimate the chances of
repayment. The borrower proved to be a phenomenally
illiterate person, in a small way of business, and stone-
deaf. His dairy farm consisted of four acres of leased
land, and his whole stock was embodied in four cows, all
well stricken in years, a flea-bitten grey horse, also in the
sere and miserable leaf, an old cart, and two dilapidated
milk-cans. He knew nothing about the bank, or the
£90,000, or anything else. But at last, after much con-
sideration, he vaguely recollected that, to oblige a certain
kirk elder of his acquaintance, he had laboriously fixed
his signature to something—he had no idea what—and
had received £lO for doing it. That was all that was ever
discovered ; who grabbed the £90,000 is a mystery even
to this day. When some happy family of directors writes
off anything between £lO,OOO and half-a-million as
“ losses,” and the shareholders, as usual, get no reliable
particulars, it always roundaboutly recalls this old story
to The Bulletin’s mind.

The collapse of the Maoriland kauri-gum trade
is attributed to the American importers being unable to
shift their heavy stocks. There was quite a boom in gura
during the erection of Chicago Exhibition, through the
enormous quantities of varnish used on the buildings.
Nine-tenths of the world’s supply of "copal" varnish is
made from M.L. gum, and it is said that a £lO per ton
export duty would speedily give to the Maorilanders a
monopoly of the manufacture of this commodity.

846 Macquarle-street North, Sydney,
August 28, 1894.
My Dear Moorabinda—
The secretary of the Sydney Women’s Literary
Club rose, the other day, in one of the various
hired chambers the club has been assembling in
for some time past and triumphantly announced
a surplus ot .£2B. And on the dignity of that
surplus it was at once suggested that the club
should burst forth into all the old glories of a
room of its own —to reduce the surplus as
quickly as possible, I suppose.
I hope, if they do again achieve their aim, thatan
effort will be made to place things on a more
artistic footing. Why not run a sort of Austral
Salon? Why not be eulchawed, body and soul,
while you’re at it ? A few yards of art silk—some
impressionist blobs on the door panels—a fair
notion of posing on the part of the committee —a
soulful name, “The Lotus Ladies,” for example,
coupled with an everlasting tea-kettle, and the
shabby, little-known Women’s Literary Club
would blossom forth as a feature of Sydney
society, I’ll venture to bet. And perhaps its light
and airy influence might even provoke the dismal
suffrage ladies into buying red umbrellas ! Aus-
tralia is a land where we want plenty of music
and red umbrellas.
The cyclamen show (that was what it really was»
though they called it a daffodil and camellia), held
by N.S.W. Horticultural Society in that munici-
pal sarcophagus—by day, at least—Sydney Town
Hall, was set a-moving on 22nd ult. by Lady
Duff (multiplied by the Duff girls and Oapt.
Tedding) whose way of doing a show distinctly
differs from any other person’s way. Ordinary
people go to look at one another more than the
flowers, but Guvment House tends strictly to
business and does the whole thing in a visibly
laborious spirit, from the honey-pots all of a row
to that eternal exhibit of potted ferns which we
have always with us. The present vice-regal
party doing their rigid duty by a flower-show
always reminds me in a hazy sort of way of people
trying to balance along a kerbstone —they looked
as if something dreadful would happen if they
glared to right or left of the exhibits.
Perhaps the most original things in the show
were the bouquets in the water (bottled bouquets,
I call them), a sort of floral pickling to keep
flowers fresh for a reasonably long time. A
“new and rare flower ” —staged in the vicinity of
a specimen of the baggy-mouthed orchid Mr.
Joseph Chamberlain has made so eternally famous
at ’Otne—was more like the birth of a shaving-
brush than anything idyllic, and I must protest
against the labelling an exhibit of our native
flowers with common school-boy nicknames. Aus-
tralian botanical knowledge must be only skin-
deep when one sees indigenous flora solemnly and
officially tagged with such names as “Bread and
Beef,” “ Sally,” and so on. There mayn’t be
®uch in a name, but if ever our flowers become
the fashion—as they are sure to do when flower-
shows have done their fell work and made them a
rarity—then the sooiety reporter, describing the
bride’s bouquet, will have a struggle to come out
of the ordeal poetically. Imagine it! “ "he beau-
tiful bouquet of long trails of Sally in a romantic
setting of bread-and-beef contrasted with a fringe
of hurdy-gurdies and old man.”
The first prize for decorated tables went to a
mild and harmless commingling of daffodils a,nd
violets and greenery that was an ideal decoration
for a school-girl’s birthday-tea, but lacking in
design and originality. Evidently the amateurs
who wrestle with these competitions are not bold
in the pursuit of color-contrasts. The new dining-
table with a revolving centre (shown at the Agri-
cultural Show) was displayed in all the pomp and
circumstance of a rough-dried table-cloth —but I
always notice the same defect about Sydney
flower-shows. The staging looks as if it had
arranged itself, although any decoratively-inclined
person can get miles of “ art ” rag and fussy paper
for I don’t know how little.
A concert in aid of St. John’s Church, Darling-
hurst, came off in the Y.M.C.A. hall the other
Wednesday with a certain amount of success, the
performers all being very nicely dressed, at any
rate. Admiraless Bowden-Smith and the two
daughters were present, and a fairly good audience,
as times go, turned up. This is the season of
charity dances —not charity concerts, which are
early, sandwichless festivities a little behind date
just now. Mrs. Herbert Lord, Miss 0. Delohery,
and Mr. Bayley Macarthur were the successful
soloists of the affair, Miss Delohery being the only
singer whose efforts were florally rewarded,
though I’m sure Mr. Macarthur deserved a but-
tonholer at least for his erotic rendering of “ Sun-
shine above.” The names of Mons. Kowalski and
Edgar ’Cello Strauss lent a classic hue to the rose-
pink programme, and the Orpheus Club was
down for three items. By the. way, if the aforesaid
club puts on many more frills it ought to be warned
off concert platforms for life. The clubbists won’t
sing last on any account, and simply make hay of
the sequence of the programme. But, after all, it
is really a confession of weakness to clamor for
the best positions on the bill. People who hold
their audiences are never afraid of empty benches.
From W. H. Paling and Co. I received “Pal-
ing’s Dance Annual,” an inviting-looking book of
favourite dance-music (including the always popu-
lar “Blue Danube” waltz), which anybody who
pipes to other people’s dancing ought to move
mountains to obtain. I have also received, more
in sorrow than in anger, the “ Lady Noeline ”
waltz dedicated to Mrs, Brough by G. Stayton;
and the “Sunny Side” waltz [not dedicated toTal-
mage), by E. S. Pitt. After carefully considering
the weak and pointless compositions aforesaid,
one is regretfully forced to the conclusion that
Strauss’ laurels are safe so far.
On the other hand, Hector Maclean (who, as the
local head and front of the Trinity Coll, exams, is
the author of all the musical mischief that has
befallen us) sends me a neat and well-written
ballade in E flat for the piano, and I was also
pleased to receive “The Aurora Australia” waltz
dedicated to Henri Kowalski by Miss Lilian
Morris. The “Aurora” is a cheeky little com-
position in the Kowalskian vein, and is very bright
to listen to in some parts. Talking of musical
successes reminds me that Maude Fitz-Stubbs’
reckless-sounding “Heather” waltz was played
by Dan. Godfrey’s band of the Grenadier Guards
at the Imperial Institute before the Royal Family
on the 14th July, when the only English com-
poser’s names on the embossed card were Sullivan,
Macfarren, and Fitz-Stubbs 1
Talking as I was, five inches ago, about flower-
shows, reminds me of the bazaar and vegetable set-
out held at an up-the-line N.S.W. town, the other
day. The wife of one of the district dignitaries
was squiring the Guvmentouse party among
the violets and carrots and things, and after
nearly knocking her front-teeth out over the pro-
nunciation of botanical tags came to signal grief
at last over a show of little apples. “ Are those
American apples?” queried one of the visitors.
“Oh, no, they’re New York pippins,” replied the
lady, airily passing on to exhibit onety-oneth.
The first of the Urso-Sapio concerts happened
on Monday evening at Sydney Centenary Hall in
the presence of a crowd fairly numerous, but
almost wildly enthusiastic. Most of the interest
centred in Madame Urso, who was here in ’Bo—-a
sufficiently recent back date, for even the toughest
spinster will own up bravely to being over 14. So
Camilla Urso got the clamorous reception due to
a favourite who re-visits her old audiences.
In a creamy costume ’of lace and satin (not so
fantastic that the artiste’s gew-gaws were louder
than her music, as was the case with Norman-
Neruda, who kept all the women wondering how
on earth she avoided getting her waving chiffon
sleeves caught in the catgut) and a sprinkling of
enviable diamonds, it was at once apparent that
Madame meant to efface herself in her music,
which was music, if you like. As a violiniste, she
is electric. She plays from memory, which always
makes each moroeau seem like an impromptu ; and
never once raised her eloquent eyes from her lov-
ingly-held fiddle. Double-barrelled encores chased
her soli—a “ suite ” composed in 1783 by a clead-
and-gone genius appropriately named Rust, and
the “Witches” dance (Paganini) which lengthened
her two items into five. Even to the non-expert,
Madame’s music was an unspeakably delicious
treat.
The handsome and pleasant Madame de Yere
Sapio, in blue satin sprigged over with gold and
trimmed with bands of jewelled gold braid, lifted
up her beautifully-produced soprano with most
effect in an operatic aria which she sang so easily
that the technical difficulties of the music were
never suggested. Madame’s voice sounds like the
vocal apotheosis of Francis Saville; there is the
same sweet, fine, bird-like quality, clear articulation
and brightness of production. Mind you, I said
“ apotheosis,” because Saville left Australia to get
the top polish that glistens all over Sapio’s sing-
ing. She was wildly encored, too, and so was her
husband, Signor Sapio, for bis own “Gavotte
Pompadour,” and Herr Scherek got a call
for a rather anxiously-played little thing of
Handel’s. By the way, Scherek ought to get his
hair cut in the interests of his own eyesight, for it
oasts quite a yew-tree-like shade on his music-
book. Madame Urso’s husband, the urbane M.
Lu&re, looked after the front of the house in several
languages.
Sydney Lancers turned out, as usual, to escort
the Governor at the opening of Parliament.
They being pure amateurs, and in nowise bound
to perform such services, it has been customary
for vioeregality to “refresh” them on such occa-
sions. Gov. Carington used to have champagne
opened for them, and the tactful Lord Jersey
followed suit, but Gov. Duff, at his first
“opening,” only opened beer; —“colonial.” This
didn’t suit the much - millinered_ brigade, so
this time they made up their minds in
advance not to accept beer ; when a couple
of gubernatorial flunkeys approached them
with partially-filled tankards of flat she-oak
the gallant Lanceahs—who are so particular that
they once actually sought to expel a man from
their ranks because they found out that he sold
socks for a living—spurned the base liquid and
said with one voice, “We Lanoeahs nevah dwink
bee-ah 1” The Duff menials sniggered incredu-
lously, but took back the tanglefoot—which will,
no doubt, do for next time.
Yours affectionately, Sappho Smith.

Melbourne Confidences.
Melbourne, August 28.
There was wringing of hands in W-o-o-e among
elders and mothers in Israel when, after parting with
their bawbees, they couldn’t catch half Talmage
said. His big voice tilled the Town Hall well
enough, but in many parts of the building, the
actual words of the yawning smiler were unin-
telligible. Songs without words have a fascination
all their own, and silver-toned Sara Bernhardt
charmed even those who confessed they didn t
grasp an inkling of what she was talking about.
But Mr, R. S. Smythe’s fleeting delusion is a bird
of harsher note and would need to drive all his
alleged wit and wisdom well home to atone for
vocal disadvantages.
A carefully distributed rumour states that the
recent servants’ ball at Government House left
the Hopetoun exchequer poorer by seven hundred
pounds. The bill is understood to be a_ melan-
choly subject with the noble Earl. It isn’t so
much what the banqueters had , as what they took
away, that rankles in his heart of hearts. One
guest, it is said, hired a dress-coat for the occasion
at a cost of 55., which item of fashionable intelli-
gence went the entire round of the ball after the
wearer had completed his tenth adjournment to
the supper-room. Later on the tail-pockets of the
garment came in handy, when the gentleman left
for home with a bottle of champagne in each.
Falling en route, both his prizes were smashed to
smithereens; but it is stated, on good authority,
that he returned and replaced their loss with
interest.
He champagne; At a Melbourne wedding,
where it had been extensively laid on, a lively
Johnnie approached the happy pair after the
ceremony and said to the bride: “Many happy
returns of the day, Mrs. X!” The lady laughed
appreciatively, but hubby glowered and mut-
tered “ Bad form 1” “ Why, darling !” cooed
Juliet, “of course, Mr. Y. doesn’t mean while
you're alive ! ” Harmony was not a bit restored
by this artless remark, and Romeo, who is said to
be morbid in his cups, challenged the jester to
personal combat. Fortunately his new - made
mother-in-law, a lady of infinite tact, fell into
violent hysterics at the thought of parting from
her darling girl, and so saved the situation.
Ethel Haydon sang sweetly at her well-attended
benefit-concert and looked very pretty in her
simple white gown. Nevertheless, the function
fell somewhat flat, I thought. The usual great
masses of garden produce were duly handed up,
but there was no fizz or excitement. Nothing to
make other girls wild with envy or set them all
agog to have their voices tested, as was the case
after the Crossley benefit. Of course audiences
can’t be expected to raise a burst of madness over
every budding prima-donna, but personal friends
and admirers might have displayed a little more
enthusiasm without danger to the roof. I suppose
there’s everything to be hoped for Miss Haydon’s
future. True, she is only a little damsel, and her
voice is not very large, but she has beauty, youth,
health and a certain very fetching air of inno-
cence. Talking of Ethel’s healthiness recalls the
fact that, some time back, while still a stage-struck
school-girl, her fellow budlets scorned her his-
trionic pretensions, on the ground that she was
“ a little dumpling.” Somehow, seminary Cissies
never allow tiiat a friend is pretty, unless she can
slice a cake with her funny-bone, and cut into the
hassock when she confesses her sins.
On dit that the Salon has sworn to have a foot
in the fame of the next Melba, who rises above the
firmament. Keeping this end well in view, the
sisterhood allows no promising vocalist to quit
these shores for Europe without previously lioniz-
ing her. They were greatly in evidence the other
night, and now come weal, come woe, so far as
Ethel Haydon is concerned, the Salon will have
nothing to reproach itself with. At the same
entertainment, a lady elocutionist orated a trans-
lation entitled “The Benediction.” In addition
to the blood and thunder of the original narrative,
the recitation piled on the pathos by retaining a
poetical Frenchified diction. Its inverted adjec-
tives, verbs, etc., suggested those linguistic feats
of the youthful French student, who reads out
slowly and ponderously, “My father has the legs
long !” “ The boy has the hair red !” etc., etc.
Although her first re-appearance had been
promised on the bills, Lady Hopetoun shirked
Daffodil Day at the Town Hall, Possibly the
chastened nose is not yet equal to inhaling the
mixed perfume of a flower-show. Then there is
always a large amount of perfunctory sniffing at
prize blossoms to be gone through by the prize
lady, so, taking one consideration with another, it
was not surprising that the goddess of the chase
stopped away. As a substitute she offered up her
small son, who might likewise have claimed
exemption on account of his teeth. He is shed-
ding his ivories in front, and might easily be mis-
taken for a mere ordinary child suffering from
the effects of a row with the boy next door.
Coolgardie, I hear, boasts a parson, who, begin-
ning his sermon with the words “ Behold, I bring
you tidings of great joy !” was startled by a sudden
upheaval of his male flock. They surmised that
he was about to reveal the whereabouts of a new
alluvial find.
The same good man lately indited a pastoral
letter from the goldfield to the “ Mothers of
Perth,” whom he requested to provide him with a
bicycle that he might more assiduously visit their
sons on the diggings. The recipients have so tut
not responded eagerly. They plume themselves,
X hear, on the fact that thetr boys are not plentiful
at Coolgardie, and they have no wish to
provide a bike for the redemption of youths from
“ the colonies.” Perth draws a line of distinction
between Westralia and “ the colonies.”
However, Lord Hope-if-you-please walked in
the shadow of his vice-regal father, and the suite
grinned in the vicinity. Something amused the
suite. I think they were tickled by the hairy and
intelligent aspect of the patriarchs who led his
Ex. around. A Governor’s rear-guards are never
hairy or wise, and the combination of those two
peculiarities makes them smirk awfully.
As for the show, the decorated dinner-tables
formed the main attraction. Round each speci-
men, women crowded en masse, arguing themselves
hoarse over its merits and demerits. In my
humble opinion, the gem of the collection was
that arranged by Messrs. Webb of Collins-street,
but not intended for competition. The artist had
obtained a delightfully ethereal effect by omitting
the inevitable Liberty silk massed down the
centre. Instead, each clear, delicate glass of
Eerfect daffodils had its own d’oyley of filmy
eliotrope chiffon.
The prize table was cool and pretty, though the
green of its silk and the yellow of its daffodils and
pansies formed a somewhat crude day-light com-
bination. The 2nd prize was carried off by a
melange of citron and heliotrope silk with yellow
daffodils, which also require the softening effect of
artificial light to be properly appreciated.
There were lots of smart frocks to be seen at
“the Daffodilleries.” Two handsome sisters
looked well in simple, but splendidly-cut, gowns
of brownish woollen check. One had the back of
the bodice-yoke embellished by three small leather
straps, while the same trimming appeared on the
front of one sleeve. It conveyed a suggestion of
surgical handiwork, a sort of ornamental “sling,”
in fact, and may have been intended for a delicate
expression of sympathy with the Countess. Rather
the correct thing, nowadays, is to look “ hospi*
tally ” in a picturesque way.
By the way, the wild flowers from Manly
excited much interest, but they were strangers
in a strange land and met with Cinderella-hke
treatment. Heaped pell-mell on a table, tied
up in tight bunches like variegated cabbages,
the poor little things certainly hadn’t a fair chance.
Now-a-days, when only one kind of flower is em-
ployed in a high-class nosegay, there seems no
charm in blossoms of half-a-dozen different scents
and hues wedged closely together. Wild-flowers
are, of course, as a rule, but tiny blooms, and
need judicious treatment, though nothing suits
the “shower bouquet ” so well as small blossoms,
if properly wired. Such arrangement as had
been attempted was worse than nothing. Anchors
and similar devices in red, blue and yellow, with
not a blade of green to break the monotony of the
woolly surface. One posy was surrounded by a
ring of what looked like worms or slugs, hut which
turned out to be an odd, curly, greyish flower.
The handsome heaths triumphed over circum-
stances, and everyone was interested in one
cluster of waratah. I heard several enthusiasts
enquiring for “flannel-flower,” but none seemed
to know whether it grew at Manly or not. It
used to, years ago, but has all been plucked up by
the roots to furnish forth religious flower-shows.

Kangaroo tendon is coming largely into
use in America for surgical sutures, so much so
that one firm in Melbourne finds it worth while
to export it to Pennsylvania in considerable
quantities.
Sydney Telegraph reports that “ a single-
handed five-card cribbage tournament has been
held at Oowra (N.S.W.) to raise funds for clearing
scrub at the cemetery.” For peaceful, unobtrusive
melancholy, this item ought to take the cake.
The production by cx-Age man Low, at
the Speight-Syme trial, of that highly-compli-
mentary testimonial from Editor Windsor, after
Purves’ furious attack on Low’s career while on
the Age staff, was rather a knock-out blow for the
burly counsel and the defendant. The latter had
no idea that such a document existed. There was
probably a warm interview in the editor’s room
that evening.
Mundi Mundi, the only N.S.W. sheep-
station in which the now defunct Bank of South
Australia had a finger, brought up four parties of
“free laborers ” from S.A. ere it could get a full
board of 33. A Union camp, formed at Silverton,
got hold of the batches as they were dropped at
various points along the line, and in one case argued
over all but one man out of a dozen.

&o. Quite a number of these gentry took passage
to New Australia and were very conspicuous ir
the troubles there.

Six years ago J. P. Abbott was tipped for

Talmage told the Melb. people he once
cured a case of pneumonia by encouraging the

An ex-parliamentarian of N.S.W, received
by last English mail two declined articles from a
London magazine office, in which enclosure was
the query; “ Mr. Gladstone has gone over this
field ; why, with your opinions, don’t you keep
your work and, consequently, its value in money
in your colony ?”
No judge who ever sat on the Adelaide
Supreme Court Bench has had a family connec-
tion of any kind practising before him, but there
was once a stipendiary magistrate in the city who
was related to nearly every successful barrister
frequenting his court. A too-outspoken solicitor
was sent to gaol for mentioning this fact, but the
libeller still practises, whereas the magistrate long
ago resigned.
Adam Porter, Chairman of the Auckland
(M.L.) Chamber of Commerce, whose death is
cabled, made three fortunes—the first at store-
keeping and gold-buying on the West Coast, the
second at mining on the Thames, and the third at
coach-building. Charles Atkin, his partner in the
big coach-building business, is the son of the man
who was plaintiff in the litigation on which
Samuel Warren based his novel, “Ten thousand

Deputy Master Anderson,
of Melbourne Mint, has published
a volume of verse under the title
of “The Agnostic and other

by a capital likeness of the official

the handsomest old men in Aus-

years Gladstonite Member for
Glasgow, and has been chief coiner
for Victoria since 1885. He

Shortly before the late
N.S.W. general election, Mr.
Tom Walker addressed a letter
to his constituents, in which re-
ference is made to the following
historical personages ; Mirabeau,
Robespierre, Cicero, Oaius Rabi-
rius Postumus, D’Espremesnil,
Petion, Madame Roland, St. Just,
Dumas, Napoleon, Alfred Edden,
the Pope, Sophocles, Plutarch,
Cato, Alexander, Callisthenes,
Euripides, Philip, Walker,

Electoral Leagues. There were
also allusions to the Brotherhood
of Man, the Macedonians, the
Maire of Paris, the Irony of Fate,
the French Revolution, the
Legislative Council, the Electors
of Wallsend, the Rights of Man,
the Holt Sutherland Estate, the
Labor Platform, the Naval De-
fence Bill, and the Statue of
Liberty.
About the time of Bishop Moorhouse’s

N.S.W. Lands Minister Carruthers still
takes much interest in football. He was a brilliant
’bailer himself until his neck was almost broken
by the mad-bull charge of an opposing half-back
who, relying on a boiler-plate skull, chin-butted
the future Minister into insensibility. Mr. Oar-
ruthers’ escape recalls a famous Sydney back
whose spine was permanently injured in a very
similar accident. It was pitiful to see him, the

Then tQ the astonishment of hls a u die nce he

to the bottom again, much as a boy would slide
downstairs at home. The doctor looked up and
remarked: “And that’s the way you go' do wn to

N.S.W. Commandant Hutton, when he
appears at any military function now, has a staff
large enough for a German corps-d’arvide. If
things go on much longer at the present rate the
N.S W. army will soon come to be all staff. The
province might be able to put 3000 combatants
into the field, and the staff consists of a military
secretary, a D.A.A.G., D.A.Q.M.G., artillery
commandant, commanding engineer, cavalry
commandant, artillery staff-officer, engineer staff-
officer, cavalry staff-officer, and aide-de-camp—
enough for 30,000 men anywhere else.
A certain Victorian Judge, now dead, was
always in the hands of the usurers. On one occa-
siqn he borrowed from a drunken solicitor. Not
being able to collect his loan he threatened an
execution, which resulted in the Judge borrowing
the money and paying up. A few days after, the
solicitor (who died some years ago) strolled into
court half-seas over, and sat at the Bar table with
his hat on. The Judge snapped like a spring
rat-trap. “Officer, remove that man to for

evil-doers in the lawless days of the diggings.
Walking down street the irate diggers used to call
after him, and when he turned round, they pre-
tended to look the other way. Immediately he
walked on the diggers would shout, “Ah, that
slews you !” Mac. noticed one ofj these jokers
and remembered him. A few days afterwards, he
was brought before him for disorder, “One

removed, “And, I say, that slews you.”

A N.S.W. widow, who found herself
encumbered with three children, got over the
difficulty, the other day, by consigning them per
s.s. Oonah, to Premier Braddon, of Tasmania.
He refused to take delivery, and at latest advices
the three unhappy mites were on their way back
to Sydney. Nothing is said about Braddon’s
language on the occasion. It is a pity the experi-
ment wasn’t tried on Dibbs, when he was at his
zenith. The way he would have damned Shikargc
would have been worth listening to.
Henry Norman, a journalist who has lived
in Corea, puts the China-Japan trouble in a nut-
shell :
First of all comes a permanent ill-feeling between
Chinese and Japanese, who have a rooted dislike of one
another. Second, their mutual jealousy as the two great
Far Eastern Powers. Third, there are Japan’s vastly
preponderant interests—population, shipping, trade-in
Korea, against China’s ancient suzerainty and her modern
political control of Korean affairs. Fourth, the rebellion
in Korea, threatening all foreigners, including Japanese,
stands for something, but not so much as has been made
out, for Korean rebellions are not very serious affairs.
Fifth, Japan is exasperated by the decoying of the pro-
Japanese Korean rebel, Kim-Ok-Kyun, from his refuge in
Tokyo, and his brutal murder in Shanghai, winked at by
the Chinese Government. Sixth, Japan is afraid, not
without reason, that China is about to settle her difficul-
ties with Russia by allowing the latter to occupy a port
on the east coast of Korea. Finally, both countries
believe themselves to possess powerful forces of the Euro-
pean kind, and are not sorry to have an opportunity of
showing what they can do with them. This is much
truer of Japan than of China.
Norman rather thinks Japan will have the best of
the tussle, as her armament is up to date, while no
one knows exactly what China’s is worth. Aus-
tralian Chinese take a different view. They
rather like the idea of the Japs, winning the first
round, and point out that China, like all great
masses, is slow to move. But she will come at
the finish, and if her 400 millions once begin on
Japan in earnest, the new Japanese constitution
will be revised once for all, and there will be a
permanent alteration in the geography-books. So
they say.
The professional saviours of Victoria have ceased to
believe in “ putting their shoulders to the wheel.” The
present necessity— vide George Turner—is “ a long pull,
a strong pull, and a pull altogether to bring the colony
back to prosperous times.” Hooroo ! Let Victoria trust
to Turner and the ’Ouse boat.
Dear Bulletin, —That Imperial “ofiicah”
who compared Vic. mounted rifles to “acwowd
of wabble chased by the police,” did not know
much. What did he expect ? However good the
men were, their horses would spoil them. It is a
delusion to suppose that any horse, if strong and
active, will make a cavalry trooper. When I
served as subaltern of a horse-artillery battery
nearly all our re mounts were horses sent from!
cavalry regiments, for no fault except that they
would not keep the ranks. Many would behave
well when halted, or moving at a walk or slow
trot, but when galloping they got crowded, and
became excited, and one of them would ruin ;i
whole squadron. That shows the absurdity of
applying English drill to Australian volunteers.
You must organise the “mob of mounted people”
on quite different principles if you mean to do
any good with them. — Trooper.

“Rolf Boldrewood’s” tardy
acknowledgment to Louis Broke,
published as an advt. in the
Sydney daily press, hardly con-
veys the somewhat startling fact
that, bar padding, “ A Modem
Buccaneer,’’for which'Mr. Browne
has got much kudos, is mostly by
Louis Beoke, whose name is well
known to Bulletin readers. The
experiences are Becke’s experi-
ences ; the narrative is Becke’s
narrative; the thoughts are
Becke’s thoughts. Bold re wood
met Becke a couple of years ago,
when he was hard-up, as writers
have a knack of being, and gave
him a few pounds for the manu-
script of his South Sea trading
reminiscences when supercargo to
Bully Hayes. From one point of
view it was a square deal, since
Becke at the time was friendless
and unknown, and could not dis-
pose of his work to better advan-
tage. With due acknowledgment
of Becke’s authorship, the tiling
might have passed. But the book
is published, without a word of
Becke, “by Rolf Bold re wood,”
astonishing the critics who “never
knew that Mr. Boldrewood had
voyaged in the South Seas.” That
is, Boldrewood trades off Becke’s
brain-work as his own and
pockets the praise. By the way,
Becke’s book, “By Reef and
Palm,” will shortly be published
by Fisher Unwin, of London, in
the “Autonym Series.” When
it comes out, the world will see
at a glance how the milk got into
Rolf Boldrewood’s cocoa-nut.
A Fijian Islander finds an empty kerosene-

most of the Western Pacifies.

Apropos the arming of the police, Jour-
nalist' Haverfield, of Bendigo, used to relate a
story of a digger in the early fifties being brought
before Commissioner Gibson on a charge of not
having a license. Accused was placed with his
back against a low sapling fence, his face towards
the Commissioner’s tent, the “Court” being held
in the open. The prisoner pleaded guilty, but
wished to ask a question. Leave being given, he
enquired if the police were permitted to fire at a
man who had no license if he ran away? “ Cer-
tainly not,” replied Mr. Gibson. “Then I’ll bid
you good morning, sir ! ’ and, vaulting the fence,
he soon ran out of sight.
Let one and all their hopes renew,
And sing and dance and joke,
For Parliament’s a gallant crew
With Turner rowing stroke.
They hit the ripples, fore and aft,
With measured beat and slow —
Speed on, speed on, thou gallant bark,
The country is in tow 1
’Tis true the country drifted back
To troubled waters, where
The outlook was a duty black
And scandal fouled the air ;
But right ahead the sun in pride
Is shining as of yore.
And hard agin’ the stubborn tide
Those heroes tug the oar.
They never pause to look about,
Their strength is never spent
(What would a country do without
Its good old Parliament ?)
The people weep ; their honest hearts
Of gratitude are full,
The darkness of the past departs
Whilst Turner murmurs “ Pull! ”
The bells are ringing merry chimes
And life’s a happy dream ;
The boat is back in better times
Safe anchored in the stream.
God bless the crew that came to save
A country from its fate,
And bless Tom Bent, the cox’en brave,
Who kept the tiller straight!

POLITICAL
POINTS
A certain Wales ex-M.P. was dis-
coursing on his impressions of political life.
“When I was first elected,” he said, “I wondered
what the boys could see in me to return me to
parliament; but when I got down and saw the
ot | ier s , I left off wondering.”
In the present W.A. Assembly there are
3 lawyers, 5 storekeepers or merchants, 6 commis-
sion agents, one ex-parson, 13 farmers or graziers,
one ex-shoemaker, 2 ex-surveyors, one ex-school-
master, and one owner of river “flats” and tug-
boats. The Upper Chamber is equally well
assorted.
The country press is well represented in
g Parliament, but since the death, a decade
ago, of Proprietor King, of the Advertiser, no
one even remotely connected with a city newspaper
has entered the political portals. Editor Bony-
thon has legislative ambitions, but the “ Han-
sard ” contract keeps him outside.

There has been much correspondence between
Kingston and Lord Ripon as to the suggested

“What’s the use of asking N.S.W. ex-
Premier Dibbs on what authority he ladled out
money -bonuses to civil servants before he left office?
He will reply that Parkes did the thing.
What’s the use of asking Parkes? He'll say
Robertson did it. What's the use of asking any
living man in the position of ex-Premier? Me II
prove to you that it was the custom since JN.b. VV.
got her Constitution.”
Price, S.A. Labour member, on the pro-
posed reduction of Parliamentary salaries; “I
was able to live as an honest man before I came
into this House, but if my salary is made much
lower I, and others, will not be able to remain as
honest as we would like to be.” But then the
great object in abolishing payment of members is
either to get rid of the honest men or else to make
them “less honest than they would like to be.”
“ Eight-hours’ Day ” in Adelaide has been

How history is made in Sydney. From
Westminster Gazette :
The birthday banquet tendered to Sir Henry Parkes, on
entering his eightieth year, was of unusual interest (says
our Sydney correspondent). The citizen’s card cost a
guinea, yet working men —laborers and artisms call d
o i or wrote to the secretary to know' whether they would
be admitted without an evening dress. On being t Id
that the evening dress was not necessary, they planked
down their guineas. The majority of those who honored
the veteran by their presence and their cheers were young
men, for singularly enough Parkes is still the most
advanced leader in Australia.
That alleged area of salt marsh and useless
sea-beach at Geelong, which certain Yic. M’s. P.
are so anxious to sell to a salt-making co. for £1
an acre, proves to be an even viler joke than was
generally supposed. The land is not marsh nor
waste sea-beach : most of it is good agricultural
soil, which can’t be used for salt-making under
any circumstances. It has a frontage to the
shore, however, and there is a feeble little estab-
lishment down by the edge of the sea where ten
men are partially engaged at salt-making. Some-
thing like 500 of the 630 acres are of no earthly
use in the salt industry, so there has plainly been
some tremendous lying over this little job.
THE USUAL CONCOMITANT.
SOUTH SEA ISLANDER (who has found a bottle of rum on the beach):
“ Where can that missionary have planted himself?
The tenants of the South Australian Com-
pany, that fat absentee corporation founded by
the pious George Fife Angas, which regularly
sweats at least a 15 per cent, div., have unsuccess-
fully petitioned for a 50 per cent, reduction in the
extortionate rents now levied on them. Enraged
at their non-success the tenants lately held a
meeting and invited Johnson and Caldwell,
M’s.P. for their district, and Homburg, M.P.,
who represents an adjoining constituency, to
attend. Strangely enough, these members are
ultra-Tories, and it was interesting to note that
they all dodged the fact that the absentee and
progressive land-values taxes of the obnoxiou 9
Kingston Ministry are the only efficacious
methods yet proposed for bursting up this oppres-
sive monopoly. Someone also turned up the
familiar old gag that “ many of the share-
holders in the eo. were widows who had
bought shares at the high (price, and if they did
not get their regular div. they would starve.” It
may also be pointed out, remarks a Bulletin
correspondent, that one tenant of the co. is
a widow, who, if hep-rent is not reduced, will also
starve, and as she goes to market all the year
round at 2 a.m. and works like a galley-slave, she
ought to be considered as well as the other widows.
To do it justice however, the S.A. Co. has done
much good. It has taught its tenant slaves the
virtues of land-values taxation, and they in turn
are forcing a similar pill down the unwilling
throats of four High Tories of S.A. Assembly—
Horaburg, Randall, Johnson and Caldwell.

Australian back-blocks business people
don’t “cotton” to the Maoriland shearer—who
comes to Australia with the object of making a
cheque and hanging on to it. A Barcoo (Q 0
squatter, at the time of the last shearers’ strike,
told the present writer that hundreds of Maon-
-Imd blacklegs got back to the land of the rnoa
with cheques averaging .£9O for their season’s
work.
An aged man named Priest was found
dead a few days ago in a?dam at Bendigo (Vic.),
with his legs tied together and a large dent in his
forehead. The police theory is that he tied his
own legs together, balanced himself on the edge
of the dam, then stunned himself with a hammer
and fell forward. This truly brilliant mental
effort is further adorned with the information
that “ deceased was a wood-splitter.”
One night recently, in the Maoriland
Council, an absent-minded reporter upset his ink-
bottle in the gallery, and the murky contents
poured down over the Hons. M‘Cullough and
Downie Stewart. The one genuine laugh which
has been heard in that dreary assemblage for
many a long day arose when the two blackened
legislators sloped furiously to the door, while the
reporter made wild of apology from his
perch up aloft.
Everyone is surprised to see how well
ex-Premier Dibbs bears his sudden reverse of
fortune. But yesterday he might have stood
against the world, and to-day he does stand
against it. There is not a feather ruffled in his
knightly coat; not the reflection of the shadow of
the likeness of the sign of the ghost of a droop to
be seen in his ex-Republioan crest. i hough a
shattered political world has fallen in fragments
around him, the ruins strike him fearless as
Horace beautifully puts it. Would it be treason
to hint Hat what gives strength to his mind, elas-
ticity to It is step, and colour to his complexion, is
M—rsh—U’sT-n—o N—rv—ue ?

“In connection with the recent murder
by blacks beyond Ninety- mile (W.A.), swift re-
tribution has overtaken the murderer of Mack.
After the outrage the black was rep >rted to have
got away wounded in company with a gin. The
next morning, however, Dixson’s party, when
about seven miles from the scene of the murder,
found the body of the black hanging from a tree, tied
by the legs, into which position he had evidently
been placed before a dozen bullets—marks of which
told their own grim tale—were fired into the
body.”-
WIRE.
The Northern Ter-
ritory electorate repre-
sented by Solomon and
Griffith in S. A. Assembly
stretches from Queens-
land to Westralia, and
contains 523,620 square
miles. Just about as big
as N.S. Wales (310,938
squaremiles), Vic. (87,884
square miles), Tas. (24.330
square miles) and Maori-
land (105,342 square

Yet Sol. and Griff, are
not greatly puffed up.
Melbourne Univer-

increase its revenues.
This establishment runs
the highest-paid lectur-
ing-staff south of the
line —and when do these
lecturers say their piece !
At night, when the
thirsty for knowledge can
come and drink? No,
for that would be demo-
cratic, and it might pay.
The professors lecture
by daylight, when the
mass of the population is
at work or looking for
it, and their audience is
an array of barren benches
with two, three, or per-
haps even six, puny
apothecaries or talkative
attorneys - in-embryo to
grope for examination
tips.
It is declared that a
score or so of aborigines
whose names had been
placed on the roll went
to a polling-booth in the
Wentworth, N. S. \V.,
district, and presenting
the card of the Conser-
vative candidate re-
quested the officer in
charge to vote for them “same like.”
To-Day, a little capitalistic organ lately
started in Melbourne, epitomises its principles in
the following choice remark :
The “cheap money” and the National Bank schemes
are two of the most idiotic, criminal, and obtuse pro-
posals ever made in Parliament, and that siysalot. If
they are ever carried into law the workingman will
quickly realise who it is who are going to be the gainers.
Wages are ruled by the rates of interest, i.e., if the
capitalist can get 8 per cent, for his money he can afford
to pay something like a fair wage ; if he is driven to com-
pete with the Government at 3 per cent,, he will have to
adjust his pay-sheet accordingly. Then follows the
starvation wages of Europe. Let every workingman
chew this.
This is evidently based on the theory that the
employer habitually lends put his money on mort-
gage and pays wages out of the interest. Ex-
perience shows that the man who lends money on
mortgage hardly employs anybody, and that the
genuine employer is generally a borrower, who
can’t pay decent wages, either because he is eaten
up by rent or by the 9 per cent, interest which he
has to pay to the mortgagee.
OUR GREAT MEN.
(Respectfully dedicated to Australia's statesmen.)
We call those great who hate all wrong
And brave the despot’s ban ;
We call those great who bravely Hght
And lead the battle’s van ;
We call those great whose word is wise,
Whoso counsel shineth clear.
Whose noble souls in direst need
Would never feign or fear ;
And these (O contradiction strange !)
Our rulers great we call,
Hecause the men who cringe and creep
Around them are so small.
Q.
P. LUFTIO.
Mr. Adrian Knox, the newly-elected M.P. for Woollahra,
N.S.W., opposes payment of members, and is paying his
official salary into the Treasury each month.
That rising young barrister, Adrian Knox,
Only lately elected by popular “ vox,”
Decides that a member should live without pay—
Work for country at night and himself through
the day ;
In a word, his best hours should be given to self,
And the cause of his country be placed after pelf.
But the falsity’s seen of this Knoxious creed
When we think of humanity’s weakness and greed.
He’s as worthy of payment, who forges the tools,
As the user who wields them to serve knaves and
fools;
And the makers of law are as worthy of lure
As the lawyers whom Parliaments’ acts will
inspire.
Common-sense and the patriot’s feelings it mocks,
Dues the movement now headed by Adrian Knox.
I am Tired!
Sufferers from indigestion and liver complaint are
subject to a continued feeling of drowsiness, head-
ache, tired, aching limbs, and a general inclination
to langor. These symptoms are duo primarily to
a deficient secretion of bile, the natural cathartic
of the liver, which, when secreted in insufficient
quantities, permits the coarse and fibrous;particles
of the food and other waste and poisonoqs matter
from all parts of the system to become Impacted
in the duodenum and lower intestines, creating a
very dangerous condition which requires instant
and proper treatment. An experience of five
years with Clements Tonic has proved this remedy
a specific for such complaints, and its universal
success has resulted in. thousands of imitations
being forced on the market; not because they
possess any therapeutic*value, for they are purely
speculative ventures. Sufferers who desire to get
relief must insist on having Clements Tonic. It
acts scientifically, has proved its efficacy in
thousands of cases as effectually as in that of Mrs.
W. Kellond, Bega, N.S.W., who writes on April
26th, 1893:—About two years ago I don’t believe
there was a greater sufferer in the world from
neuralgia ; I believe I tried a hundred different
remedies—in fact, everything that was recom-
mended to ysc, but without being relieved. My
attention was drawn to Clements Tonic and the
number of cases that had been cured by it—cases
resembling mine. By the time I had finished
three bottles of Clements Tonic I was thoroughly
cured of all neuralgic symptoms, and I have never
had a recurrence of the old complaint. I have
recommended it on all occasions. Hoping this
may benefit others who are suffering from the
above complaint. —I am, yours gratefully, Mrs.
W. Kellond, Bega, New South Wales.

One of the Melbourne evening horrors
has a cookery-column, containing three different
dinner programmes from which the good house-
wife can make her selection each returning day.
There is a French menu, an English menu, and a
“Plain Fare,” which is desperately Hinglish, like-
wise. These are introduced with suitable texts.
The Plain Fare text affirms —“ It’s not what you
eat, but what you digest which makes you happy,
healthy and strong.” A sample of the digestible
dinner bills: “Ox-tail. Corned Beef. Suet
Dumplings. Mashed Potatoes. Cabbage. Macca-
roni Pudding.’’ Get that lot across your chest
and you will be happy. The Bulletin idea of an
airy meal is roast zinc with Yorkshire pudding,
parsnips (underdone), parched peas, leather
fritters, and soapy cheese to alleviate the pangs of
death.

S.A. Freemasons are wroth because Grand
Master Kintore neglected a big local function in
order to attend to Gov. and Lady Hopetoun, who
were then visiting Adelaide. They would like to
throw him overboard in favour of little Chief-

but they are afraid of laying irreverent hands
upon the Deputy Lord’s Anointed. Then, too,
the Milky Way would be curdled at the very

It looks extremely likely that the Win-
deyer clan will shortly monopolise N.S.W. Divorce
Court work. Judge Windeyer presides on the
Bench; his son-in-law, Mr. Ralston, appears in
almost every case, and young Mr. Windeyer, the
Judge’s son, admitted as a barrister a few days
ago, has already made his appearance as a divorce
counsel. In Queensland and Fiji, the practice of
allowing the relative of a Judge to appear before
him as advocate has been stopped.

Mayor Willcox, of Adelaide, gives his

Amongst the mob of
fool-women whom Sydney

upon the husband question,

whose hubby is a policeman ;

An Australian, reputed
to be worth at least £500,000,
recently went into the shop
of a country draper to buy a
shirt —one shirt. He over-
hauled all sorts and condi-
tions of shirts for half-an-
hour, and at last inquired
the price of one. “ Three-
and-elevenpence.” Then the
wealthy Australian turned
on the miserable draper and
annihilated him with one
fearsome glare. “ Darn your
cheap shirts !” he said, in a
hair-raising voice. “ When
Igo in for an article I like it
good. Show me some at four
bob I”
Sydney Sunday Times nas roused up a
new kind of monster. A little while ago it called
on its women readers to write and say what kind
of husbands they wanted, and the great, aggregate
spinster thereupon rose like one female and sent
in a full description of her ideal mate. They arc
dismally pathetic reading—these letters. So
many of the yearning spinsters would be content
with so very little, and they are so very little
likely to get it, that the world looks even more
desolate after reading the four columns of gush
than it did before. Most of the spinsters want a
big man, “who is strong and healthy,” and big,
stupid, ox-headed men who are strong and healthy
are numerous enough in all conscience. Also,
most of them insist that he shall be economical and
fond of home. After that thm iiverge wildly in all
directions. “ A Cornstalk ” desires “a chemist
with a good paying business who will sell only
first-class goods.” He must smoke a little (but
not cheap tobacco), and be respectful to the aged.
As if a man who trades in hair-dye, bloom of
youth, false teeth, and the like, could preserve
any respect for the aged. “Adrian” wants a
man who will openly admire other women besides
his wife— he ought to be easily found, anyhow.
Another wants a Radical parson, whose mother
lives at a distance. She proposes to save £1 a
week, so that if he dies she can open a little shop,
“and therefore^would not need to marry again
being true to his memory.” One lady wants “a
man who can use his fists ” —not on her, but on
someone else. Evidently the desire to see some-
one else badly battered is a feature in her femi-
nine soul.
There are also urgent demands for “a man with
a good, open face, brown moustache, and hair
parted at the side and brushed off the forehead ” ;
a man “ who will like to be petted once in a while
—perhaps oftener ” ; “a gaol-warder or Customs
officer, who will never be out after 10 at night,
give his wife all his wages, and never ask an
account ” ; and a person “ who wears a ring and
carries a stick said person will be allowed out
two or three a week, but must come home
by 10.30 in a vertical shape, instead of arriving
on all-fours. Also “ Violet ” states openly
that her husband must have heaps of money
and must let her do as she darned well
likes. The rest of the crowd—and they are
many—don’t soar above a plain and simple desire
for a tradesman who is sober and earns £3 a week.
Only one of them all wants a journalist, and as
she insists on him being a sober journalist, the
inference is that she doesn’t want her journalist
very badly. Taking the letters all round, the
general want is a big, good-tempered man who
will be home by ten sharp. One woman, and only
one, insists on a husband who will bring her a cup
of tea in the morning before she gets out of bed.
This lady is_ the most hopeless of the lot. Her
natural destiny is evidently to marry an ancient
wreck with a multitude of strange diseases, and
rise up constantly in the middle of the night to
get hot-water bottles for his cold and horrible
feet.

Dr. Dutton, whilst under examination in
Melb. Divorce Court, received a private letter
from the Judge to remain in Court after the jury
had been dismissed for the day. When that
awful time arrived his Honor advised the pallid
respondent (who evidently didn’t know what was
coming) to abandon all idea of clearing out to
Maoriland with the children before the conclusion
of the case. Dutton had obtained an appointment
at Dunedin, and was supposed to be on the poin’
of a sudden departure.

More Imperial baubles ! Queen Victoria

Little people are having a bad time in
Australia just now. Mad fathers or mothers have
slaughtered their children in half-a-dozen dis-
tricts, within the week. Some madman has wan-
tonly mangled three sleeping infants during the
temporary absence of their now distracted mother,
a widow ; a N.S. Wales J.P. and his wife have
been convicted of treating with most marvellous
cruelty a child in their employ; and a Sydney
man has been caught hanging up his son by the
neck and waist—the latter attachment just to
prevent absolute asphyxia, and so keep the loving
father out of the condemned cell. All those who
have killed their children are evidently mad—in
most cases through poverty following on financial
disaster and want-of-work.

A Ballarat woman has got herself into
trouble by registering a borrowed baby as her own.
Her husband was anxious for an heir, and she
procured one from a neighbour, and presented it

paper, and was appropriately jubilant until the
law interfered and undeceived him. It is a wise
father who is quite certain about it.

Parson Talraage, in his lecture on Evolu-
tion, declares, with the dreadful cocksureness of
a well-paid Amurikan preacher, that whoever
doesn’t believe in the story of the Creation as told
in Genesis is “an infidel.” Also, whoever doesn’t
believe in the literal interpretation of everything
else that is asserted in the Scripture is “an
infidel.’’ The Bulletin here rises to say, with-
out any unnecessary discourtesy, that it doesn’t
believe that Talmage believes in Genesis himself.
Also, it would like to put that hoarse expounder
to the test. It has certain ideas of its own as to
the most appropriate way to apply that test. It
would like to have Talmage kidnapped at mid-
night, by two masked men, and shoved into a
marriage covered with crape and drawn by four
black horses. It would drive him along furiously
for a vast distance till it arrived at a lonesome
ruin, and then it would take the great pastor
under a crumbling archway, and down 150 stairs
into a subterranean vault, where one or two
candles shed a glimmering light, and the water
dripped from the rock-hewn roof and fell with an
eerie sound into the pools on the rock-hewn floor,
and where long, hollow echoes reverberated
through black side caverns, and came back in
strange groans out of fissures.
Then it would take off all the preacher’s clothes,
and cut his hair short, and give him a shower-
bath, and dry him with a horse-rasp. When
this was over he would be led, with nothing on
but a misfit bell-topper jammed down over his
ears, and with a broken feather sticking out of the
brim, through a maze of corridors, until at last he
was ushered suddenly into an illuminated cavern
where 43 masked men dressed in red sat in a semi-
circle, with a skeleton and an open grave and a
coffin in front of them. A large executioner—the
very largest executioner who could be got for the
money—would be sharpening a jagged axe on a
grindstone. And the/e we would make the naked
preacher take a dreadful oath on a skull, and
when the oath was finished we would ask him in
a dreadful voice, while the executioner made the
grindstone whirr furiously, and the masked men
all stood up and waved their swords, or their
pickaxes, or their halberts, if he really and truly
and unreservedly believed in the Mosaic story of
the Creation. And down there, in that dank
cavern, Talmage, in a state of absolute nakedness
—barring the misfit bell-topper—rand with his
hair cut to a stubble, would aokribwledge in a
shaky voice that the Mosaic creation was all bosh.
So would almost any other preacher, for that
matter.

A Brisbane publican, charged the other

The Bulletin doesn’t believe that any Christian

disposal, which is a point against the advertiser.

“ IMITATION
is the
SINCEREST ELATTERY.”
The articles most imitated are
CLEMENTS TONIC and
FLETCHER’S PILLS.
WHY?
BECAUSE they have the best reputation and
are most in demand by the public, consequently
every dishonest trader tries to trade on their fame
and renown.
It is really wonderful that the Australian people
are slow to see the truth as regards the un-
scrupulous quacks and charlatans who prey on
the credulity of the Australian public. Scarcely
a week ever passes but what the press exposes the
barefaced and shameful practices of some of these
harpies, yet, in face of all they seem to thrive,
and the paper who hounds them down most
thrives fattest on their ad vertisements and cracks
champagne over each balance-sheet. Clements
Tonic and Fletcher’s Pills have never yet stooped
to deception and misrepresentation. They are
scientific therapeutical agents, and evidence as to
their value can be found in every district, and
such being the case it is unnecessary to further
extol their virtues.
How to Get a Piano or Organ.
YOU, of course, want the highest quality of tone, action,
touch and beauty of exterior you can afford; but
you must have durability. Durability is an indispensable
condition, and however cheap an instrument may appear,
without durability it is worthless. Avoid the cheap
pianos, for which there are agents in every town, who tell
—and often through ignorance believe—that they are
equal to the Steinway or the Erard or some other first-
class maker. Therefore, no matter how big a bargain you
think somebody else offers, investigate
OUR LARGE AND VARIED STOCK OF
THE REST MAKERS.
STEINWAY & SONS’
AMERICAN PIANOS.
The great superiority of these Pianos is the result of
thoroughly seasoned, absolutely faultless material, and
more perfect workmanship, and of essential differences
and improvements of construction.
ERARD & CO.,
Established in Paris in 1780.,
The new Parisian models may be seen in our Show-rooms.
The world-wide fame that the firm of Erard & Co. have
enjoyed for more than a century is more than maintained
to-day, owing to the great increase in the number of
instruments manufactured.
LIPP PIANOS.
These celebrated manufacturers having discovered several
bogus makers imitating their famous instruments, have
decided to entrust their entire Australasian business to
us, and have appointed us absolutely Sole Agents for
Australasia, gAMpLES NQW 0N VIEW .
We have also in Stock the first-class Pianos by Julius
Feuricb, Carl Eoke, Gors and Kallmann, Uebel and Lech-
leiter, The Victor, The Belling, Kirkmann, Collard, Seined-
mayer, Kaps, and others.

On the other hand, a point in his favour is that he
is “ recently from England.” All Christians are
more or less recently from England—except, of
course, those who are still in England.

Students of a certain N.S.W. State insti-
tution complain bitterly of their time being wasted
owing to the prevalence of dipsomania among
lecturers.
# # #
With a view to the weeding-out of sexa-
genarians, all N.S.W. State school-teachers sup-
posed to be bordering on 60 have received, from
the authorities, a request for full particulars as to
their ages, length of service, etc. The wise-heads
of the Education department themselves, and
also the inspectors, number many in their ranks
who are considerably over the tabooed age.

Since cheap fares became the order of the
day, passengers on the steamboats between Maori-
land and Australia are a mixed lot. Recently at
dinner-time, in the saloon of the gorgeous Roto-
mahana, a hoarse voice broke the stillness address-
ing someone at the other end of the table. “Bill,”
said this utterance, “I bet I’ll take up more peas
on my blooming knife than you will.”

A new regulation in N.S.W. Education
Department compels Inspectors, much against
their will, to notify schools of the date on which
they propose holding the annual examination.
Previously, the Inspector used to swoop down un-
expectedly on the school to try and catch the
teacher napping. And he was frequently success-
ful, too.

Editor Bulletin—Every Sunday morning
the same four women wait for the steamer on one
of Sydney’s watering places. Every Sunday
morning the same young man with a pious, gentle
face and an earnest, upright manner comes and
kisses those four women. They all look better as
they get on the steamer together. He is obviously
a thoroughly good young man, and he kisses in a
pious, deliberate way that is in perfect harmony
with the noble earnestness of his character. There
is no legal objection to the young man kissing
those four women, but, for all that, the ecstatic
twitch of his nostril in the act of kissing fills my
soul with rage and sorrow, and I would like that
young man to kiss them the night before. . . .
It happened many, many years ago. He was a
great red-headed brute, and she the prettiest of
gentle little wives. He used to kiss her in public,
and his nostril used to twitch, I knew the dear
little soul for 15 years before I dared ask her why
she always walked with her hand on her back as
if in pain. Her big eyes filled with tears. “ I’ll
tell you in confidence,” she said. (Gentle women
who cry like to make a confidant of you). “ Every
morning John puts his feet into my back and
pushes me out of bed to get the breakfast.” The
look she gave has haunted me a lifetime. And
now I can never see a man kiss a woman in the
daylight and twitch his nostril without thinking
of that dear, loving little soul with the sore back
and the great red-headed brute with the large
square feet. It makes me feel murderous —Yours,
Joseph Smith Deeming.
According to the Noumea correspondent
of Sydney Daily Telegraph— who was on the
spot and ought to know —the visit of H.M.S.
Orlando was notable for the freezing reception
accorded to Admiral Bowden-Smith and his
officers, as compared with the ovation given a
couple of months back to the Russian cruiser,
Kreiser, when <£4ooo was spent in a hilarious
orgie. The S.M. Hkkald— like the nice, cour-
teous paper it always has been—observes, per
contra, that “ the visit of H.M.S. Orlando proved
highly popular in Noumea.”

The great German plantation co. is heap-
ing coals of fire upon the heads of foreign whites
and natives alike in Samoa. Latest advices from
Apia state that “ were it not for the great planta-
tions of the German Co., the island would pro-
bably be in the throes of starvation.” What a
lovely picture it would make to see Robert Louis
Stevenson and the Stevenson entourage waiting
outside the big German factory in Matafele to be
fed on keg beef and cold yam by a stout Teuton
with pale-blue eyes and a pitying smile !

The memorial-card industry is still in full
blast both in Sydney and Melbourne. The busi-
ness is worked on these lines. The morning
papers are scanned for death-notices, and all the
likely ones are promptly set up in type, and with
a more or less appropriate verse of Scripture are
printed in gold on black cards. A dolorous-look-
ing canvasser —you must be dolorous-looking, or
you can’t succeed in this line—takes the “ proofs”
to the six or eight houses of mourning to which
they refer, and he is a “ waster ” if he does not
come away with a pound order from at least 75
per cent, of his clients. A house with a corpse
still in it, and a family all broken up with grief
will often pan out as much as a couple of
sovereigns. There is lota of money in the busi-
ness_or rather used to be—for too many are at it
now, and three canvassers chasing after one corpse
would kill the best scheme on earth.
Apropos, the present writer one morning stopped
on the steps of a Melb. warehouse to offer his
condolences to the proprietor, whose wife had
died the previous day. Two lugubrious-looking
personages, attired in black, were hovering round
evidently anxious to have a word with the
bereaved husband. Whispered the latter, with a
baleful glance at the waiting ghouls, “These two
fellows are gravestone-drummers. I have had
four undertakers, an embalmer, and a printer’s
canvasser here already this morning, and my poor
wife scarcely dead 12 hours.”
Another ghoul incident. A Brisbane labourer
met his death by accident, and the first intimation
that his wife had of her widowhood was an under-
taker’s tout tapping deferentially at the door and
handing her his boss’ business card.

To check the increasing tendency of
parents to take their children from school and
put them to work before attaining the pre-
scribed age, the N.S.W. Education authorities
have found it necessary to raise the standard of
the exam, required to be passed by pupils who
want to leave school before reaching the age of 14.
The exam, is so stiff now that scholars who have
successfully negotiated the junior exam, have
lately been “ plucked ” in the school examination.
HUCKSTERING.
Now what may come
Of all this row
’Tween Jap. and Chow,
To make things hum ?
If Chow lick Jap.,
We care not how,
Or Jap. beat Chow,
What harm can hap ?
Chow learn to fight ?
Our coast invade?
Fair risk for trade,
So that’s all right.
For beef Jap. buys—
A million pounds—
And up by bounds
Per ton goes rice.
And coal’s a-boom;
So let them snap,
Both Chow and Jap.,
For elbow-room.
And here’s all hail
To Li Hung Chang ;
Let both sides bang—
We’ve coals for sale.

SUNDRY SHOWS.
SYDNEY SHOWS FOR OOMINQ WEEK.
Hbk Majesty's “My Jack.**
Lyceum ; “ Morocco Bound.**
Oriibriom .... " Charley's Aunt).**
MELBOURNE SHOWS FOR COMING WEEK.
Princess's “ The Cabinet Minister.**
Theatre Royal "The Sunny South.”
Alexandra ** Missing at Lloyd’s.”
Nothing of a strikingly novel character
has interrupted the even tenor of “My Jack,” at
Her Majesty’s, during the week, save that the
“revels on the deck of H.M.S. Seagull have been
strengthened by the appearance of Mr. Fred Dark.”
It is one of the favorite delusions of the melo-
dramatic author that the British tar is much given
to revels on the deck of Her Majesty’s ironclads ;
whereas in reality that miserable naval worm is
liable to get 14 days double duty if he is even
found smiling in the presence of a midshipman.
This takes most of the realism out of the “revels,”
still that giddy variety entertainment can pass on
its own merits. Sooner or later, however, The
Bulletin will feel called upon to suggest that the
poor little scuffle in the Soudan is getting about
used up as a dramatic episode, and that the villain
and the wronged and gloomy hero have got lost on
the burning sands quite often enough, and that
the villain has died out there—after confessing his
sins—until his bones must form an unbroken lino
from the Nile Cataracts all the way to Khartoum.
The great historic spectacle of “Henry Y.*’ is
understood to be in preparation.
** * *
Further rumors of the magnificence of
“ Morocco Bound,” which is to occupy Sydney
Lyceum on Saturday, under M‘Mahouian
auspices, continue to arrive. A portrait of
Miss Nannie Harding, the new prima donna,
appears in this issue. Miss Harding looks
lovely enough to run an opera all by
1 eraslf. Also, it is alleged, on unreliable
authority, that the rest of the co. is fully up to
this sample. Further, it is rumoured that in the
matter of high-kicking “ Morocco Bound ” is even
ahead of “Mdlle. Nitouche,” if such a thing is
p )ssible. A further prolonged study of the giddy
opera last-mentioned makes The BULLETIN fear
that it isn’t possible.
** * *
Miss Nannie Harding, whose portrait
appears in this issue of The Bulletin, is the latest
notable acquisition to the Australian opera-bouffe
stage. Miss Harding was engaged by Mr.
MacMahon, in London, to create the part, in
Australia, of Ethel, in “Morocco Bound,” which
goes up at Sydney Lyceum this Saturday.
Although very young, Miss Harding has had
quite a career. She was prima-donna of the
D'Oyley Carte Co. during its memorable tour
through Germany, appearing as Yum-Yum, in
‘ The Mikado,” and Lady Ella, in “Patience,”
in Berlin, Vienna, Leipzig, Dresden, Munich,
&c. This tour occupied upwards of a year,
and after its conclusion the young prima-
donna returned to England and created the lead-
ing rdles in “The Yeoman of the Guard” and
“ The Mountebanks.” Miss Harding is a Welsh-
woman—a circumstance of which she is peculiarly
proud. She was born in Pembrokeshire in 70,
and began to study music at a very early age. She
possesses a marked individuality and a bewitching
piquancy of manner and pronunciation. Nature
hrs exhibitsd a distinct prejudice in her favor, and
it will bo matter for surprise if she does not
captivate her Australian audience at sight.

Frank Thornton returns to Sydney Cri-
terion on Saturday to play a 12 nights’ season of
“ Charley’s Aunt.” A brief outbreak of the good
old “Private Secretary” will probably follow.
Considering that Sydney has been very short of
comedy for some months past, and making due
allowance for the fact that Frank Thornton is one
of the best comedians ever exported to these
shores, there ought to be plenty of money in the
venture. Mr. L. J. Lohr is manager.
** * *
Miss Maggie Moore reappears at the long-
deserted Sydney Royal, Sept, 15, with “ Struck
Oil ”as the programme. Maggie’s occasional re-
appearance is the one bright episode in the history
of the Royal nowadays. When she comes, which
happens altogether too seldom, the old theatre
fills up and assumes something like its ancient
aspect of prosperity ; and when she goes away,
which happens much too often, it relapses into its
familiar condition of loneliness, and the forgotten
play-bill hanging outside looks like a shirt hung
up to dry on Babel.
** * *
The Barrington variety and burlesque co-
is, so far, meeting with better luck than most of
its predecessors at Sydney School of Arts. Never-
theless, The Bulletin views this kind of enter-
tainment with strictly limited enthusiasm, and
even the appearance of “the fine specialty artist,
Sam Keenan,” doesn’t rouse it from its apathy.
One black “specialty artist ” with a mouth like an
open door is so like another that this paper can
seldom tell one of them from the other, or either
of them from anybody else.
“The Bauble Shop” was performed at
Melb. Princess’s, on Saturday, by the same good
Brough and Bouoicault company which failed to
make a vigorous success of it in Sydney. The
central idea of a Prime Minister’s romantic passion
for a shop-girl is fresh and true. It was in trying
to turn it too far to the purpose of political
satire that the author over-reached himself. A
suggestion that “ The Bauble Shop ” was intended
as a deep joke can be answered by the hard fact
that Henry Arthur Jones never jokes. His four-
act plays are serious attempts to achieve the sub-
lime, and he steps over the border-line uncon-
sciously. An author who, in “Saints and
Sinners,” could allow someone to say, “If our
Queen knew of your conduct she would tear those
epaulettes from your shoulders with her own fair
hands,” has certainly no keen sense of the
ridiculous. He damaged “ The Middleman ”by
trying to put forward the easy victim of a weak-
minded young man as a heroine. His “ Dancing
Girl ” was the work of a mind that sees natural
greatness in dukes, as dukes, and its momen-
tary London success lay in the lamentable circum-
stance that the public mostly shared his delusion.
There has been something seriously the matter
with each of Mr. Jones’s plays, for the reason,
perhaps, that he has never been able to laugh at
himself. “The Bauble Shop” runs for a week
only, and on Saturday they set up Pinero’s
“Cabinet Minister.” Messrs. B. and B. are
striking the local political iron while it is hot.
• • • *
By the way, a great theatrical event hap-
pened at the Princess’ on Monday of the present
week. The refreshment bars passed into other
hands, and the incoming management provided
new properties and effects, together with an
interesting change in the female cast.
** * *
“ Missing at Lloyd’s ” is still revelling in
its great marine disaster at the Alexandra. Dan
Barry’s advertisements don’t do much more than
full justice to this ingenious series of spectacles,
which are realistic and billowy, and altogether
more imposing than the average Alexandra sensa-
tion. The last chapter in the shipwreck, con-
cluding with a rescue of two weary fragments by
a vessel, is a credit to the stage-carpenter
and a triumph for the unseen forces that agitate
the broad expanse of ocean.
** * *
At the Royal there is a good deal of ship-
wreck, and George Darrell rushes forth to the
drowning passengers in a tub that only George
would venture to navigate. The tub contains a
mast and sail when it puts forth from the shore,
but for the return journey George plants himself
and the heroine in the place where the sail ought
to be, and the wind carries them along just as
rapidly. Meanwhile, a line has been fired to the
schooner by a rocket. At brief intervals
a wet seaman travels violently down the
line by means of a sliding hook, and is
restored to consciousness at a coke fire. Judging
from the slant of the rocket line the sinking
craft must be 100 yards above the level of
the sea. Another rousing novelty in “Hearts of
Oak ” is a dastardly attempt to blow George to
pieces with a dynamite-cap. On this occasion, it
is the heroine who preserves George. Perceiving
his white, insensible face in the moonlight, with
the fuse smouldering away behind his right ear,
the maiden swings herself across a chasm, trips
daintily along a rocky path, and throws the
dynamite down a precipice, whereupon there is a
fearful explosion in the bowels of the earth, and
some artful person throws masses of blasted rock
upwards just to show what would have happened
to George if the young lady had not intervened.
On Saturday they revive “The Sunny South.”

Fillis’s Circus has broken out again in
Melbourne at a new place, the Feeley Family and
all other things being as good as ever. Also, the
annual time has arrived for an Agricultural Show,
and the variety companies are laying themselves
out to catch the horny-handed producer on the
hop, and send him back to his rural home with »
chorus on the tip of his furred tongue.

It is hardly necessary to repeat that Miss
Violet Yarley (Mrs. Joseph Tapley), whose por-
trait is printed in this issue, made her first
acquaintance with the stage as a Pollardian
juvenile. The petite lady was still in her teens
when she attained the dignity of a place among
the principals in the “ Firm’s ” famous company,
and became associated with Miss Flora Graupner
in leading parts. It was whilst singing in “The
Old Guard ” that Miss Varley’s fresh young
voice charmed Sarah Bernhardt, and earned
the tribute of the tragedienne’s bouquet.
More recently the subject of this notice
made her biggest hit as La Cigale, playing and
singing the prima-donna character to the delight
of audiences in Sydney, Melbourne, and else-
where. Miss Varley’s most particular achieve-
ment during the past few months has been her
marriage with Mr. Joseph Tapley, a oomnetent
critic who shares the general belief that his pretty
little wife has many operatic triumphs in store for
her.

Dear Bulletin, —I attended Talmage’s
last Melbourne lecture, “School for Scandal,”
and, out of fifteen jokes, one struck me as brilliant
and quite new. Crowding out, I heard a venerable
man, with Parkesian hair, complaining about the
resurrection of that one “ new ” joke, with the
bitterness of a worldling who has struck an oyster
of last year’s picking. — Yours, Snell.

“ Amusements.—Under this heading sea Rev. Dr. Tab

possible to put it more neatly.

difference the Lyric club’s performance at
Melb. Alexandra recently, and the Melb. Opera club’s
performance of “ The Gondoliers,” at the Bijou, was that
the young ladies of the former showed more of their upper
storey, to the great satisfaction of the gods, while the
young ladies ol the latter displayed, to the utmost delight
of the baldheads in the stalls, more of the lowerstorey. It
was al 1 bust with one club, and all limbs, encircled with
fleecy lace and embroidery, with the other. Plump and
shapely limbs they were, of which the pretty Melb. Opera
club damsels should be highly proud. The Lyric club
girls, whose modesty would not allow them to display
their nether limbs to advantage, were, such is the force
of fashion, almost bare from neck to waist.
Melbourne Poverty Point is again commencing to be
thronged with actors out of harness, who have for some
months been touring the provinces, during which time
Poverty Point has been deserted.
Ada Crossley thinks her only serious rival in London
now is Miss Clara Butt, the tallest female singer in Eng-
land.
Talraage’s favourite lecture is that on “The Bright Side
of Things.” He is very fond of “things” that are bright
on both sides—sovereigns. He gets fifty every time he
holds forth.
Dion Boucicault goes to England shortly, and thinks of
bringing back with him a small comedy co. He has been
making inquiries about the Oxford (Melb.), formerly the
Gaiety. Its stage is just the size for a small comedy
crowd.
It is said that a certain pretty actress left a certain
theatre because one of the actors “ persecuted her with
his attentions.” Such marked attentions, too 1
The Melb. notices of “Aunt Jack,” B. and B.’s new
farcical comedy, must have staggered those observant
managers, for eulogy with a good deal of “ but ” in it was
the most they had a right to expect. A chorus of hysteri-
cal praise produced good business for a week, anyway, or
perhaps it was accounted for by the pretty general desire
to see anything and everything 8.8. during a short
season.
Rickards is the marvel of the music-hall stage. At
fifty-eight years of age he has much more voice, “go”
and magnetism than any other Australian performer in
the same line. If he were to re-appear on the London
'all stage, with two or three strong new songs and the
reputation of being as old as he really is, 'Arry would
make a lot of the reigning “ stars ” look small. Rickards
Redivivus ! He would need to be properly explained and
set forth on the programme, so that a decrepit, alcoholised
Cockney every here and there among the audience might
state to the youngsters that this was a man who had
outlived five-sixths of the 'Arries who heard him when he
first came out. As for his rivals of those days 1 And how
to account for it I Rickards has the vitality of his race.
He is of the Chosen.
“ No painter, writer, orator, who had the power and
judgment of a thoroughly cultivated musician, could
sin against the broad principles of good taste,” says
Philip Hamerton. Yet the Marshall Hall-ite, who
ventures to write or orate frequently, does sin against the
broad principles of good taste, a professional musician
being too often a professional prig, if not an unmitigated
snob. His intellect feeds on musio alone, whereas
Hamerton speaks of a man who takes the art medicinally.
Are the long-haired cranks listening?
Talmage gave four lectures in Melbourne. An extra
three would have sufficed to play him down to empty
benches.
Stimulated by Talmage’s monetary success it is pro-
posed by certain religious speculators to offer other
lecturers promoters’ shares in themselves. Thus, say,
Rev. John Johnson, Limited, capital, £60,000 in 500
shares of £lOO each ; of which 300 will go to the pro-
moted.
“Martha” writes to the Argus about Talmage’s
lecture that an apparently inebriated gentleman left
noisily by the hack door before the lecture was over,
loudly declaring his opinion that it was rot. “Those who
heard him,” she adds, “looked gratefully at him for ex-
pressing their own sentiments so tersely.”
Irving has bought the English rights of Mme. Sans G6ne
in order, on dit, that Ada Rehan may not have a chance
of playing it, and so outshining Ellen Terry, who would
be as unsuited to the heroine’s part as Irving himself
would be to that of Napoleon.
During her season in Adelaide, Sara Bernhardt turned
round suddenly and said, in French, of course: “My
God lit is cold ; bring me a cloak.” And it was brought.
So naturally was it all done that very few of the audience
knew that the incident had nothing to do with the parti-
cular tragedy being enacted.
People desiring to know the truth about

Troubles, like snakes, should always be
faced, and a cheerful and prosperous exterior is
always best, however hard the fight. There is a
public benefactor in this city who has done much
to give that creditable appearance which, to quote
him, “is better than bank-notes and as good as
gold.” Those who seek him go forth arrayed in
the latest and glossiest of hats calculated to secure
an overdraft even on landed security. His name
shall be nameless, but his initials are Priddy the
Hatter.*
The yarn that a man and his wife and
seven children were lost for a month in Anthony
Hordern’s lacks confirmation. It was said that
they came down from the wild bush to see the
great city of Sydney, and, arriving by night, they
walked straight across from the railway station
into Anthony Hordern’s, and thought that was
Sydney. So every day they did some shopping
at a fresh counter, watched the crowds of people
making purchases, had their meals in the restau-
rant, and slept by night in the bedding and bed-
steads department. It was only when their holiday
was over, and they wanted to go home again, that
they found they had never been out of the great
Haymarket Emporium all the time. A glance at
Anthony Hordern and Son’s new catalogue makes
one wonder whether this story is so impossible as
it looks. Literally millions of articles of all
descriptions are noted in the 480 pages of good
things which more than justify the firm’s title of
“ Universal Providers.” As business literature,
this catalogue is the most remarkable thing ever
issued south of the line, and speaks of an immense
expenditure of brains and method. The firm
which has produced it, as one of the chief sources
of Australian industry and enterprise, has every
reason to be proud of such ,a monument of its
success.
The story brief of a statesman grave
The son of an ancient earl,
Who came to grief when he oddly gave
His heart to a toy-shop girl.
Though swayed at first by an evil whim
He shrank from his purpose vile,
For the toy-shop lady converted him ;
But her saintly boss, with whiskers grim,
Was hovering round the while.
’Tis awful to think that the seraphim
Are Hard-shell persons, with whiskers grim.
Who hover around the while.
The statesman lord and the damsel fair
Took tea in the shop one night;
So the saint sneak’t ip and found them there.
And brought all the facts to light.
The scandalous narrative, half untrue,
Admitted of ne’er a doubt;
The statesman’s party was left to rue
His folly in doing what all men do
And getting himself found out.
It was not immorality, bold and “blue,”
But “some damfoolish thing which all men do,”
And he was the man found out.
At Poverty Point.
“ Dad ’’ Hallewell’s show pupil is a Miss Galvin. At her
debut Gerald Thompson, of S.M. Herald, made a few
complimentary remarks, winding up with, “ You fairly
electrified the audience.” “ Galvinised is the word,"
grunted “Dad.”
A Bourke (N.S.W.) man, who was “saved” through
Talmage’s sermons, journeyed to Sydney to see the man
who had oped to him the pearly gates. Talmage gave
him an audience, and the story goes that when the owner
of the salvaged soul took himself off, the circus divine
seemed quite relieved. “ These sort of interviews.” he
said, “ generally wind up with a request lor a free pass to
the lecture.”

There is but one trouble ahead of the totalisatoi
in S.A.—the clubs are beginning to overdo it. The S.A.
clubs are the richest in Australia, as they have big
balances, whereas in the other provinces the clubs are
either in debt or only just solvent. Already M’Gillivray,
M.L.C. (S.A.), is anxious to secure the tote for the Port
Adelaide club on the ground that it is as much en-
titled to it as the others. It was this very argument that
led to the abolition of the machine in S.A. in 'B4.

Tommy Corrigan’s best friend was Martin
Loughlin. Martin informed the writer that he bad
twice arranged with the jockey to take the pledge,
but that Tommy did not come up to the scratch on either
occasion. Martin dropped racing mainlv on this ac ounl.
He told the writer that he would trust his life to Tomnn
when “off it,” but when he lost Corrigan he gave racii g
best, as “ there was no other man to whom he could trust
his money over the sticks.”

Even the lowest welshers and toughs of Mel-
bourne raised their hats as Corrigan’s funeral pissed
over Princes* Bridge, but what can any decent man think
of the professedly holy firm which took advantage of
the occasion to distribute broadcast along the route of
procession the following handbill
WHAT TOMMY CORRIGAN SAID !
Extract from the Argus, 13th August.—‘‘A little while
back I found for the first time that I was a bit nervous
before the start. It wasn’t steeplechasing, however, that
affected my nerves, but strong tea. I tried cocoa for a
change, and the nerves were soon as right as a book
again.”
essence cocoa is absolutely pure, and is in-
finitely more healthful and nourishing than tea. H should
be used by everyone. One pound will make ICO to 180
cups of delicious cocoa. Sold in tins and packets by all
grocers.
Ask for essence cocoa and take no other.
• * • •
The Melb. benefit-meeting to Corrigan’s widow
did not pan out nearly so well as was expected; many
who should have been there were absent. However, it
was a mistake to think that as much enthusiasm would’be
shown over Corrigan dead as had been done over
“Augur” Chapman alive and able to write. Even with
sporting men gratitude is in some sort a sense of favors
to come—and poor old “Augur” had a nice way of
noticing people in his “ Under the Elms ” column.

The Melbourne detectives who have in hand
the case of an absconding clerk say that they have
had scores of offers from spielers to hand over the
absconder within six hours provided each of them “ gets
a bit on account." The most persistent of them happens
to be a man whom the absconder assisted monetarily
(about three months ago) to keep him out of prison.

For heroic self-sacrifice commend m to the
advertising sporting tipster. One of the fraternity who
announced only a fortnight ago that he had put his
“clients on to every good winner since last Melb. Cup,”
has just filed his own schedule. Liabilities, £llOO ; assets,
nil. No doubt he purposely backed stiff-’uns himself to
make a good market for his customers.

Four years ago 150 Melbourne bookies had
£lOOO volumes on the two-Cups double. There may be
500 who have the same this year, but there might be a

It takes a racehorse to carry 12st. up the hill at
Moorefield, and then smother his field in the straight as
Ballater did on Saturday last in the Welter Handicap.
Gallater and Kelso are a combination hard to beat.

Waltzer’s people were before the stewards at
Moorefield, on Saturday, over the Tramway Handicap
running, but explanations were satisfactory. The crowd
watch Waltzer closely, for they have an idea that some-
day that neddy may be in the humour. And the idea
obtains that the day Waltzer is in the humour the rest of
the field may as well stay at home.

N.S.W. trotting owners have only themselves to
blame for the fact that whilst the sport is really taking a
hold in Maoriland and Victoria, it is completely dead
about Sydney, Lilliebridge being the only ground which
now risks a trot. At Aspendale Park, Vic., the other day,
the consistent Osterley won the Handicap Trot in the mag-
nificent time of 5.2-J for the two miles.

The purchase of Capstan by W. T. Jones is a
food augury for that horse's backers for Caulfield Cup.
robably “Bravo” got sick of seeing so splendid a
chance of another big Cup being fooled away in pursuit
of tinpot stakes. Burnett was said to be putting the pro-
ceeds of each of these little wins on the son of Sheet
Anchor for the Caulfield. But what a way to back a
horse, and what a style of training a would-be Cup
winner 1 Very probably Mr. Jones had already a big stake
on the horse.
THE MODERN ARENA.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
And here the buzz of eager thousands ran.
And tuneful laughter rippled up the tiers
Of rustling stands. A Title, in the van,
With Beauty, Wealth and Fashion for compeers.
'Tis Caulfield, and attendant hopes and fears
Burn high where snowy bosoms rise and fall.
The stirring history of the vanished years
Will now be re-enacted. Each and all
Must play their part once more in this day’s carnival.
“ Up with the rag,” and see all eyes intent
Where yonder colors form a silken skein ;
Now, in prismatic-hued confusion blent,
They disentangle and unite again.
Then sweep away in order, and the strain
Draws tightly at the heart, and, Ah 1 a thrill,
A gasp, a shudder as of actual pain.
The favorite wins it 1 ’Twas a nasty spill 1
But men like those, you know, are difficult to kill 1
Yes, raise him tenderly, he struck the rail;
The horse took off, a moment in advance.
Some water, someone 1 He’s so deadly pale !
Stand back there, you, and give the man a chance !!
There, lift him gently in the ambulance—
Another jockey meets a jockey’s fate.
Make way a moment, and then—on the dance I
No truer horseman ever topped a gate
Than he who now abides the final Steward’s weight.
’Twas not unpleasant when emotion thrilled
And pitying interest dimmed sweet eyes with brine;
I saw one point where Nicholson was killed,
And caught the whispered name of Silvermine,
“ Sic transit gloria." See anotherline
Of eager horses marshalled for the fray 1
Hark to the thundering shouts 1 Whose colors shine I
The favorite wins 1 1 The favorite all the way 11
And brings to Joyous close a sportsman’s holiday.

the previous grass-record 2‘33, his own, by 1-5 second.

In the foot-racing, Sydney was simply “ iot in
it’’-the local clubs’ only good showing being in the 120
yards Scratch Team race, when Hill finished first, although
Melbourne won the contest on points. Hdls time was
12 l-ssec., which beat Richards’ previous best Australian
record (amateur) by 2-ssec. Davis, of Melbourne, a
magnificent hurdler, was the hero of the day.
* * • •
Davis, who won the hurdles at Sydney on
Saturday, running 135yds. over ten 3tt. 6in. in
ISiseos., is a natural hurdler, better even than Bob Lusk,
and probably very near Batger’s form, if extended. He
takes his fences in his stride and was never pushed on
Saturday. The quarter-mile showed the Victorian,
to be an all-round good man, for, with two hurdle heats in
him, he ran home an easy winner by syds. in 53 l-2seo.
♦ * • *
Cartwright, Ladies’ Bracelet winner at Sydney,
is officially credited with running lUJyds. in 11 9-lOsecs.
in the final, only 4Jyds. worse than evens on newly-top-
dressed grass. J. Hill, of Sydney Harriers, is similarly
credited with 2yds. worse than evens, v.e., 12 1-5 for
the full distance. As he only won by a few inches, people
are asked to believe that Davis and Shaw are at least up
to quarter-second. •
Sculling champion Stanbury is still living at
Rvde. He has very little indeed to do, and is much dis-
gusted at the perfidy of Englishmen Bubear and Harding.
They gassed that they had £5OO to match the latter
against big Jim, but when the champion’s agent went to
England, ready to cover it, they were found unable or
unwilling to raise as many shillings.
* * • •
The beating of the N.S.W. team of Rugbeiana
by second-rate Auckland augurs ill for its success in any
but very small matches in Maoriland.
« • • *
lb is within the law, bub hardly fair to real
amateurs, to allow the three-mile record of 15.27, by
Manrilander Burk, to stand. Burk was for years a noted
M.L. pro., and it was only when he had nothing to con-
quer that he got admission to the amateur fold.

A Sydney evening paper lately sent a circular
to the N.S.W. Rowing Association offering a big trophy
for a double-scull race in club skiffs, open to amateure in
the Australias, the race to be called an Intercolonial
contest. And now the joke comes in. Association
patronage was asked for, the only stipulation being that
Messrs. Moor and Waters, of the North Shore Rowing
Club, should be barred from rowing in the same bo it. To
call the advt. an intercolonial contest, aud bar the crack
Sydney crew, bangs Bannagher.
Wool and Produce Reports.
M‘Burney, Wallis & Co. report:—This being wool-
sales week, several lots of new clip passed over to buyers
under the hammer at prices in excess of this time last
year As vet the new wool is sound and well-grown, but
in some cases lighter in the grease than last year. We
have the pleasure of seeing our prediction verified, and it
is now evident to all that we are to 1 a-e a happier state
of things in our wool auction-room this season, ihe sales
were attended by the largest number of buyers ever
known for the time of year. Although several foreign
buvers are again with us, we have a number yet to arrive,
and it is reasonable to expect a still further inorease in
price when the full buying strength of the world, America
included, congregates to bid for the chief product of our
country. Apart from the free admission of wool into the
United States, trade is becoming more animated in England
and on the Continent. The cloud of depression which lately
enveloped the whole world is lifting and the time is close
when business will once more be conducted in the sun-
shine of prosperity. Although prices are likely to be
better this year we would caution owners against hamper-
ing their broker and prejudicing the sale of their wool by
placing excessive reserves upon it. Select a reliable
broker and put your faith in his judgment is the best
advice we can give on this point.
Auer. 25th, 1894.
New Zealand Loan & Mercantile Agency Co., Limited,
report Wool : The sales held during the past week
attracted a very large attendance of the trade and passed
off satisfactorily, prices being a shade firmer, especially
in the case of scoured wools which sold at up to 14a.
per lb. Several lines of the new clip were brought for-
ward, and for these wools prices slightly in e xcess of last
year's currency were, in most instances, forthcoming.
For the CWB over ROYSTON mark from the DarhngDowns
we received an offer of 7d. per lb. for the best fleece, and
at this figure the parcel was withdrawn. Our latest cable
message from London reports a fractional advance in
values for sheep-skins, and we anticipate that the Sep-
tember wool-sales in London will open at an advance on
July closing rates.

The Sale of a Landlord,
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Somebody was stealing the palings. Day
by day the gap at the bottom of the yard grew
larger. The palings were being carried off in the
night. The landlord was angry. He questioned
the man who lived in the house— such a house, too,
a poor, narrow, miserable-looking little cottage,
badly-built,_ badly-drained. But the tenant could
throw no light on the mystery. He said it was
strange, and hard on him.
“ I’ll watch,” he said.
But his watch brought no evidence to light. The
stealing still continued.
“I'll watch now,” said the landlord.
For three days and nights he kept a guard, he
and his two sons. On the third morning they
made a discovery.
It seemed that_ the tenant himself got up early,
just past the middle of the night, and pulled up
the palings to light the fire with. They caught
him in the act.
Forthwith a summons was taken out and served
on him.
“ Miserable wretch !” said the landlord, a pro-
sperous trader. He was sitting in his office next
day when there came the sound of footsteps round
his door. Somebody knocked.
“ Come in,” he called.
Then the door opened and a procession came in.
The tenant first, a baby in his arms. Then a
woman—his wife, no doubt —also carrying a child.
Then one, two, three, four, five, six, seven chil-
dren. They darkened the doorway.
“ What on earth !” said the landlord.
It was about the summons they had come, ex-
plained the tenant. He was woefully out-at-
elbows, and had a hand-to-mouth look generally.
So had his following.
There was nothing to be done, said the other.
They must go away and not come bothering him.
Attend at court when the thing came on. That
was all he had to say about the matter.
So they trooped out dolorously, the tenant and
his burden, the wife and hers, and the seven
draggled children. It was several minutes before
the echo of their footsteps died away. They
haunted the Landlord for quite a time.
• « •
The case came duly before the magistrate.
The landlord remembered to be there. The
tenant would like to have forgotten, but dared
not.
And he came as before with a body-guard. He
came with the self-same infant in his arms, the
wife behind him with a little one in her arms, the
long train of miserable-looking children bringing
up the rear. There was quite a sensation in court
as the sad procession trooped in.
“Poor wretch,” said the landlord. He had
meant to be hard, but this was harrowing. He
was ashamed of himself. He whispered to the
magistrate that he did not want to follow this up
too harshly. Be as lenient as possible. And in
the end the tenant was let off with a shilling tine.
“ We had no money to buy wood, and no food,
nor nothing,” he pleaded.
And the landlord found himself paying the
fine.
“It doesn’t do to be too hard,” he said.
“ There’s such a thing as measure for measure.”
He gave the tenant ten shillings, and told him he
must look out for another house as soon as he
could.
He had meant to send him out that day—five
weeks’ rent was owing. But those nine children
made havoc of his resolutions.
He told his wife about it when he got home.
It seemed, then, that she knew the people well.
She stared at him for a minute.
“Nine children/ Why,” she said, “they’ve
only got three 1“
And she was right.
M.L.M.
“Indecency is a matter of longitude and
latitude. In the East it would be regarded as
indecent for a woman to go about with her face
uncovered. In Victoria it is not regarded as
indecent for a woman to go into a ballroom only
half dressed.”— James Smith in the “ Ovid ”
pi j. e.cution.
Premier Reid says : “ Now I tell you that
every penny that travels into one man’s pocket
must have come from the pocket of another man.”
Must it, indeed ? Then how did the first man who
ever wore a pocket—the son of the last man before
pockets were invented—come to have any money ?
And where did the first penny come from ? Also,
how is it that there is twenty times as much
money in the world as there was some centuries
ago ? Again, if no man can have any money save
what was previously in the pocket of another man,
then the chain of reasoning goes right back until
it is distinctly proved that all the money on earth—
nearly 40,000 tons of it, at the lowest estimate, not
reckoning paper money and Parkes’ cheques—
must have been in the pocket of the first man, and
how on earth he could get round after victuals
under such a load passes comprehension. Is Mr.
Reid prepared to face thisinevitableconclusion, and
does his creed allow of a first man with 40,000 tons
of money in his pocket ? Further, is Mr. Reid pre-
pared to assert that gold and silver habitually
grow in pockets and don’t come out of the ground ?
Lastly, as his theory distinctly implies that wealth
can’t be increased—in other words, that the world
can’t become any richer than it is, no matter what
fiscal policy it follows, then what is the good of
Freetrade? Also, what is the good of anything?
The Bulletin intends to follow Dibbs’ plan and
send these queries along to Mr. Reid by a special
messenger, who will be instructed not to come
away without an answer, even if he has to sit on
the Premier’s door-mat like an accusing spirit for
70 days.
Dear Bulletin, —lt wasn’t so much the
miners of Waratah who rejected Melville as the
railway men. Miners are more constant —witness
the return of Freetrade Fegan by Protectionist
Wickham. Not so the railway men. When the
railway men of Redfern embraced Protection and
tribune Sohey failed to profess it, he was rejected.
Six months afterwards, when he did profess it, he
was returned. The railway vote (I don’t mean
the railway civil service vote) was everywhere a
Labour one. The railway constituencies returned
Labour members, the railway dep6ts in the
country supported Labour candidates. Which
shows what an excellent army the Labour leaders
have failed to organise in the railway men.
Numbering 10,000 or more in N.S. Wales, the
Australian federation of railway men should be
the third or fourth strongest union in Australia,
and that factor in the destinies of Democracy that
the railways are in the destiny of Australia.' But,
alas ! it is not yet. Holman had a paid position
as secretary of the discredited R.T.E. Associa-
tion, and left it worse off than he found it. But,
of course, it was beneath the dignity of young
man Holman to be the apostle of the railway men
—the W. G. Spence of the railroad. He preferred
to be the W. A. Holman of the Central Com-
mittee. — Lag oon.

This property immediately adjoins M'Auliffe’s Lease, No. 156, which has been recently purchased for
an English Syndicate for a very large sum, and the following extracts from the S.M. Herald will
give some idea of its great value
“Mr. H. J. Saunders returned last night from a lengthy inspection of the properties secured by the Western
Australian Goldfields Company. He is well satisfled with the mines, especially with JTAuliffe’s Day Dawn, at White
feather, in which wonderfully rich gold was struck at a depth of 12ft. in the new shaft in the centre claim. The
southern shaft is down 60ft., and shows heavy coarse gold all the way.”— Sydney Morning Herald, Wednesday,
July 25, 1894.
“ At White Feather gold has been struck in a claim locally known as belonging to Lord Percy Douglas, purchased
for the Western Australian Goldfields Company, Limited. It bears the name of M'Auliffe’s claim, and is said to be
richer than Bayley’s or Londonderry.”— Sydney Morning Herald, August 11, 1894.
The cost of maintaining property from 12th inst. to be borne by the Syndicate ; any gold obtained
during this period to be the property of the Syndicate.
Reports on the property by Mr. W. H. Gorbould, M.A.1.M.8., and Messrs, Robert Pettigrew, J.
Treloar and A. Goldie can be inspected at the office of the Syndicate, 131 Pitt-street, Sydney.

It is a lighter, clearer, and more ethereal oil than any
I have hitherto used, besides being free from the heavy
nansdous odour characteristic of others.
Tiiis is particularly noticeable when the oil is sprayed
iutothe throat.
It is very palatable when taken internally, which places
it above oilu r preparations, and considerably enhances its

HOW BABIES SUFFER
From Torturing Humors
When their tender Skins are literally On Fire with Itching and
Burning Eczemas and other Itching, Scaly, and Blotchy Skin and
Scalp Diseases, none but mothers realize.
To know that a single application of the Cuticura Reme-
dies will, in the great majority of cases, afford instant and complete
relief, permit rest and sleep, and point
to a permanent and economical (because
so speedy) cure, and not to use them
without a moment’s delay, is to be guilty
of positive inhumanity. [No greater leg-
acy can be bestowed upon a child than
a skin without blemish and a body nour-
ished with pure blood.

“Genius is more common among men
[than women] by virtue of the same general

Welly ni’ way, and welly polite, but no pay you.

A very well-known N.S.W, police-othcex',
now high up, had a narrow escape. When a
trooper, he happened to gain the envy of a certain
bush publican, ac whose house he put up one
night “weary.” Seeing the officer “overcome,”
Bung attempted a coup de main. He stole a
lodger’s watch and chain and planted them in the
trooper’s boots ! The scheme failed, inasmuch as
X. was up first in the morning and found
the plant, on returning which to the landlord he
placidly explained that want of direct evidence
alone prevented him from prosecuting Bung for
the theft.
In Newfoundland, the Premier(SirWilliam
Whiteway), most of the Cabinet, and about half
the Ministerial party have been ejected on petition
for bribery and corruption. Apparently the fish
province is about as corrupt as Canada, and
Whiteway is in a fair way to be another grand old
man of the Macdonald pattern. Both Canada
and Newfoundland are, as a general thing,
disgusting and crawlsomely “loyal,” and this
latest development makes it almost look as if
loyalty and swindle were much the same senti-
ment.' See how loyal Victoria stinks !

Dear Bulletin, — If “H. J. Mac.” isn’t
starting a lie - competition, his latest cantan-
trurn (copyright!) mayn’t be so wide of the snake
business, after all. That Saga of “ Wild Fer-
guson ” has a fine jarnboristio flavour about it,
anyhow, which suggests that where the common,
nickel-plated boozer “sees snakes” the gold-
mounted M’Cooey “gets navvies.” And was it
“artistic restraint,” or a lucid interval that made
him omit to describe how the Osdanic Ferguson,
having feasted on the slain, by the light of history,
even unto seventy times seven, ascended to the
bottomless pit in a chariot of tanglefoot. All which
is not greater nonsense than the assertion that a
navvy is never a man. There are plenty of
navvies who could give the eminent M’Cooey
points in fair-play and common-sense, and who
have nothing but physique in common with the
Yisitation-of-God hero who finds his Homer—or
his Munchausen—in the wild-haired Apostle of
the Adder. —A.M.
The successful removal of Piles of the

Editor Bulletin. —“Jerry” is not quite
correct about Sydney charities—notably the
Labour Bureau and Benevolent Asylum. With
regard to the latter, its one inspector, having been
at the work for years, is worth all the three
Government-stroke men of the former. The B. A.
is practically a Government institution, and, as
the two work into each other’s hands, double-
banking, such as “Jerry ” hints at, is out of the
question. Further, the L.B. only gives food, and
that only to the value of Is. s|d. a week, to each
family—no fuel, salt, pepper, or vegetables—and
that is given in the shape of orders on a local
grocery firm. If the husband is, in the opinion of
the L.B. officials, unable to work, he is sent over
to the B.A. across the street, and vice versa.
Now, all this is utter folly. It is demoralising. It
would surely be easy to give these poor people a
chance to earn the little they get, if it were only
to set them sawing firewood.—R.

James Tyson kept an account for 25 years
of the profits he made out of the progeny of one
brindled heifer, which he had acquired by swap-
ping a flute. The total, he says, was over .£70,000.

a truthful brand of millionaire but this little yarn
compels it to put on its hat crossways.
Dear Bulletin, —Your par. re Mr. Foster’s
(Melb.) Try Excelsior class is hardly accurate.
Mr. Foster started the “Try” class at his own
house, Canterbury-road, which is in Toorak,
beyond the village, and within 200 yards of the
top of the hill. Mr, Foster’s boys were the lads
of the neighbourhood, some of whom I knew. The
“Excelsior” class was brought into existence by
Mr. Groom, the members of which were newsboys
and poor lads. After some time these two classes
amalgamated and became the “Try Excelsior”
class. Mr. Groom was, I think, a working man.
He was a splendid fellow, a born teacher and dis-
ciplinarian, and won his way into the hearts of all
his boys. Why he eventually left Ido not know.
Perhaps some of your readers could give more in-
formation on the subject. I have always had an
idea he was not treated fairly. His class was the
more important of the two when they united.
There was a good deal in the papers about him at
that time; but, with the exception of one para-
graph some time afterwards, he appears to
have altogether dropped out of notice. — North
Eastern. Chiltern (Yio.), Aug. 10,1894.
Melb. Akgus came out the other morning
with an innocent-looking little paragraph, remind-
ing the printing-trade that the “drag-net” clause
in Treasurer Carter’s evanescent Budget would in-
clude cheap periodicals imported from England by
the ton, so that the trade in Penny Bits and
Waste Scraps and other “ comic ” offal would be
more or less wiped out, to the benefit of local
publishers and compositors. Having, by infer-
ence, congratulated the printing-trade upon this
circumstance, the Argus cheerily observed “it is
not anticipated that the duty will be charged on
the letter class of periodicals, such as the Art
Journal,” which was glad tidings indeed. In
short, the Argus warmly approved of Carter’s
drag-net application to imported prints of the
“ inferior ” class, and when the local newsagents
held an indignation meeting, it' omitted to report
the proceedings. There was a special virtue in
Carter’s net concerning which the companion
organ to the Australasian was mute. The
Bulletin, being an imported, and not a “ better
class ” periodical, would have been subject to a 10
per cent. duty.

The Dead March of the Waters.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
By the blazing messmate seated, as the skies begin
to darken,
And the eager flames ascending seem to flout
the tempest’s din,
Swells, mysterious and mournful over all, a surg*
ing. Hearken!
'Tie the Dead March of the Waters, and the tide
is coming in.
Near the headland where the she-oaks swing their
" melancholy tresses,
And the ti-tree turns to twilight all the sultry
glare of noon,
Where the wrack in clinging clusters every basalt
crag caresses,
Broods in solitary silence Desolation Point
lagoon.
There, when youth’s brief course grows sluggish
and its lures have given over,
Are the merry mountain waters to the bitter
ocean wed,
And the tides roll heavy laden with the sighings
of a lover,
And in secrecy and sorrow does the sea give up
. its dead.
Evermore, from furthest ocean, drift wan garlands
to that wooing,
Bruised and broken, stiff and twisted, are they
cast upon the strand ;
On each face a pallid calmness—half a smile at its
undoing,
Half a shattered hope of rescue —and a clinching
of the hand.
Though I’m ageing to that musio I shall never
cease to fear it,
Still I draw up to the fireside, happy but to be
within;
Think it foolish ? Listen, there now 1 That low
moaning I Gan you hear it ?
'Tis the Dead March of the Waters, and the tide
is coming in.

In western Queensland a traveller perished
of thirst last summer. A squatter, passing in his
buggy, saw the body, and, merely satisfying him-
self that life was extinct, went on and informed
tiie police. Two horsemen then came along, and,
after a cursory examination, also went for the
police. Then the police came: they searched
more closely, and found in the dead man’s pocket
a sheet of paper with this scrawled on it: “I am
dying of thirst, and have .£BO on me. I hope
whoever finds me will take it, so that the
traps sha’n’t have it.”
The Anarchists of the Bush.
The distribution of anarchistic literature in
Queensland draws special attention to the con-
dition of that hopeless Australian brotherhood
called travellers, or tramps. For these men the
reign of anarchy has no terrors, and not a few
lustful, revengeful possibilities. There may be
found to-day, in empty houses and sheds from
Sydney to Melbourne, a rough charcoal sketch
representing a female figure with tripod on
head, a torch in her right hand, her left point-
ing back to a house in flames, and underneath
the inscription, “Anarchy is Liberty ! Down
with all tyrants! No law, no law-giver !
Among the travellers this crude drawing is
known as “ The Stiffening Angel.” Upon posts,
gates, deserted houses, and bridges on many
of the inland |roads a white cross is also to be
met, with the motto, “Anarchy is Liberty,
while one mysterious brand is traceable for
over 200 miles along a single line of road.
These things are probably the work of a
few madmen, but that does not lessen the
danger to the society which has made them
mad. The swagman’s usual greeting, “Old
man, it ain’t far off,” may yet possess a more
dread significance than attaches to the voice of
mere idle discontent.
« * •
The swagmen of the past could be easily
divided into two classes—good workmen, who
promptly smashed their cheques at the nearest
pub., and then humped “ bluey ” in honest
search of a fresh job ; and professional “ sun-
downers,” who turned up, year in and year
out, with automatic regularity. With neither
of these have the unemployed of to-day
anything in common. The old swagman
had, in most cases, either innate laziness or
inordinate love of rum to thank for his position,
and the squatter was well repaid for rations
when labour’s own legs brought labour without
cost to capital’s door. To-day all is changed.
Thanks to their own land-hunger and conse-
quent slavery to the banks, nine-tenths of the
squatters have no money to pay for labour;
and farmers have even more than in the past to
rely on their own unaided exertions for putting
in and taking off their crops. Unfortunately,
the number of wage-earners has not decreased
in proportion to the shrinkage in demand.
This winter men, who, a few years ago, had
never to ask twice for a job, are saying in the
bitterness of their hearts, “I’ve never begged
before ; and rather than live this dog’s life I’ll
go to gaol.” When the legitimate bush-worker
is thus tried, it is easy to understand the damn-
able despair of the hordes of artisans, labourers,
clerks, larrikins and social camp-followers
who are now swarming out of the cities
into the poverty-cursed country districts.
Alarmed by the yearly increase in this “army
of the night,” many of the squatters are either
pulling down or neglecting to repair the old
travellers’ huts. From the same cause the
ration has dwindled until a pint of flour is
generally the standard for all New South
Wales, excepting the lower Murrumbidgee and
Darling, where no ‘ ‘ tucker ” of any kind is
given. In Queensland, also, the days are
coming when food and shelter will be denied
altogether —in some cases, doubtless, by men
glad to assert their native meanness on the first
plausible pretext, but in many others for the
simple and unanswerable reason that squatters
who are paying 8 per cent., 9 per cent., and
10 per cent, for money, yet getting no equiva-
lent in the way of stock return, and farmers
who cannot pay their bank interest and store
bills out of the price of their crops, are unable
to feed scores of hungry men for the pure love
of the race.
# * •
During April, May, and June, at one small
holding of 9000 acres on the New South Wales
Southern line, the average of men begging
for food has been 100 per month; and
during the first four days of July, 34
travellers were fed, while at a neighbouring
estate 36 men camped in the hut on a single
night. At another Southern station, once the
home of a big-hearted native who, it is
said, left a provision in his will that no man
was ever to be turned away hungry—two bul-
locks are being slaughtered every week fortravel-
lers, the weekly average of whom has reached
as high as 70. The old cry that men could get
plenty of work if they liked to take it at a rate
of wage which it was in the power of employers
to pay, has to-day no foundation. The writer
was within the past fortnight implored by a
strong young fellow to take him on at ss.
per week, while land which, five years ago,
could not be grubbed for less than .£1 to £2
is now being made ready for the plough at
from 7s. to 17s. 6d. per acre. At the present
time hundreds of men are tramping across
wind-swept plains and over mud-choked roads,
without swags, and owning no earthly posses-
sion save the rags which hang about their half-
starved carcases. Fathers are leaving their
children to the tender mercies of strangers
rather than see them die from exposure and
hunger. Worse—delicate women and half-
grown girls are wandering about without either
food or shelter. In the huts that still remain,
strange companies meet night after night
drawn together by a common wretchedness.
They curse the hand that has doled them out
their pint of flour, and, illogically it may be,
speak of the approaching reign of chaos as a
period which, if not bright with hope, is, at any
rate, lurid with the fiercer fires of revenge.
And this is the spectacle which Australia, with
greater natural wealth than almost any other
country in the world, offers after a hundred
years of settlement!
Queensland Commissioners, who refused a
special train to Charters Towers footballers, ran a
special train to Wallangarra on a Saturday, spent
Sunday discussing matters of interest with the
N.S.W. Commissioners, and returned to Brisbane
on Sunday night. The saintly Ministers of the
Crown, who also raised a hypocritical whine and
stigmatised Sunday football as went
recently to the Bay in the Lucinda, received a
deputation on the Sunday at Southport, and
inspected the breakwater there, making a few
political promises as by-play. Talk about cant!
A Minor Tragedy.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
I WAS witness to a tragedy in real life to-day, one
of those that are of such common occurrence
that they only touch our sympathies'in print. It
was in a malodorous by street in a dirty Mel-
bourne suburb. There was a dead_ cat in the
stagnant gutter. A tall, black-haired woman
hung over the shattered verandah-railing of a
small tenement, brandishing her long, bare, tony
arms on high, and cursing at large in a shrill,
piercing voice, inarticulate with drink. All
along the street, on each side for a hundred
yards or so, frowsy, slatternly women stood
in gateways, or thrust their heads out of windows.
Around the tall woman blaspheming under the
verandah was a motley crowd of ragged boys and
girls, capering like little fiends, squealing and
jeering, and inciting the female to further flights
of profanity by their malicious tricks,
I recognised the woman at once as the show
“drunk” of the street—without one of such no
poor locality is complete—the woman whose
periodical “bursts” from one of the few enter-
tainments afforded the residents in a poor neigh-
bourhood.
Every now and again the drunken woman would
make a furious rush at her tormentors, and scatter
them, shrieking, over the road ; then there would
come a chorus of laughter from the frowsy heads
along the street, followed by a cyclone of bad
language. The inebriate cursed everyone in sight,
reviling them with the most opprobrious epithets,
to their evident immense enjoyment. _
Presently an ill-clad, dirty little girl came
hurrying round the corner, carrying a paper-
covered parcel, which she handed to the performer
under the verandah, who quickly stripped off the
paper, and then brandished aloft a bottle of beer,
twirling it in the air defiantly, and yelling her
exultation at her neighbours, interlarded with
insults and curses.
It was her triumph. The women along the
street seemed to feel their disadvantage—they did
not laugh, but a boy in the crowd, seized with an
inspiration, took aim at the bottle with a stone,
and it was shattered in the woman’s hand. Her
taunts were instantly frozen on her lips, her eyes
dilated, and she stood, with her hands aloft, one
clutching the bottle-neck, gazing down at the
spilt beer running over the floor, dumb and dread-
ful. So might a frenzied wife and mother gaze
upon her murdered husband and dead babe.
When I see a tragedy queen capable of that—
that attitude, that gesture, that expression, I will
proclaim a genius.
SILAS SNELL.
“Almost thou persuadest me to be a
Christian ” —as the Jew said to the pork-pie.
Storv from Hoyleton (S.A.). A farmer
noticed'that one of his pigs had been badly bitten
by mice, and he determined to kill it at once to
save as much as possible of the meat. When he
opened the animal he found that the mice had
eaten a hole through its side, devoured all the
intestines, and made nests in the cavity so formed.
Quite a nation of young rodents were caught
inside the pig and killed. The owner of the
grunter tells the story himself, and no other suf-
ferer by the ravages of mice dares to make him
afraid. The severity of the plague may be
judged from the fact that one farmer at Crystal
Brook lost hay worth £75 by the depredations of
the mice.

Off His Shoulders!
A STORY OF SOUTH-EASTERN BORNEO.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Kendall rose to his feet, astounded. Men
said there was no such thing as Fate, yet here, at
Ids feet, was the helpless body of the man he had
sworn a thousand times to immolate at sight!
And now there was no need to stir a finger. lie
1 1 ad only to stand by and let blind circumstance
avenge him.
He tramped away along the sodden sand with
hasty steps, then slower, then a stop to look back.
Around one prostrate form the Dyaks had
gathered striving to revive the spark that made as
yet so vast a difference between it and the other
two stark things that stared, unseeing, at the
morning sun.
“ A minute more of that work,” the white man
muttered, “and there’ll be three of them !” He
turned away his head resolving not to look, and—
in the very resolution—looked again. Then pro-
fessional instinct conquered and he went swiftly
back. The Dyaks—after a fashion that has
“cooked” so many half-drowned men—were
standing the subject on his head “to let the
water run out of his mouth !” Kendall thrust
them aside, got the man over on his back, brought
forward the retracted tongue, and set two of the
Dyaks to semaphore the arms. The rest stood
round respectful of the tuan's wishes, but quietly
incredulous of results, until the castaway’s livid
chest took up the motion of itself. At which
miracle their apathy gave way, and they contended
for the task of rubbing back the circulation.
“Hello! hello!” Shadbolt, the trader, came
down the sandy slope. “ Three of ’em, eh ?—and
life in this here chap, by the looks of him. Here
you are! ” and he held out a battered pewter-
flask.
Kendall took it and sniffed. “Not yet,” he
said. “ But I’ll tell you what you can do. Get
him up to the huts—put hot stones to his stomach
and feet, and, when he opens his eyes ’’—handing
back the flask—“ give him plenty of this with hot
water. Then he’ll do.”
Shadbolt—flask in hand—gaped after the other
as he walked away. “ Leaves it all to me, he
does ! Freezin’ cool kind of a cove is the doctor,
when he likes. Well, it’s Dr. Shadbolt’s case
now, at all events; and he ain’t like the rest of
’em—he can tackle his own physic like a good
’un ! ”
He took a goodly gulp of the arrack and went
over to look at the two defunct. “ Malay, one of
’em,” he muttered ; “and a sturdy little nugget
he is ! But I can’t exac’ly place t’other cove ;
unless he’s one of them Portuguee mixtures from
up Banda way—in which case he ain’t much loss,
anyhow. Now for Number Three ! ”
But Number Three—shoulder-borne—was 50
yards off, on his way to the village.
* * * •
It was mid-day before the trader—much
meandering—reached Ids house. Kendall, flap-
ping at the sandflies, lay in the verandah ham-
mock, and impatiently he turned his away
when he heard the erratic steps. He was in no
humour for fooling, and this man was*Mrunk
again. But Shadbolt’s speech was soberer than
his legs, and his wits less drunk than either. He
stalked solemnly around the hammock.
“ Happy t’report, doctor, that the case you lef’
on my hands is progressin’ favour-a-bably.”
“So are you, I see! I expected as much when
you sent up for more arrack !”
Subsiding upon an empty gambier-box, Mr.
Shadbolt loftily put aside the arrack question.
“Neither here nor there, half-a-gallon of hard-
stuff aint! It’s about these here cas’aways I want
to tell you.”
Kendall sat up.
“ look the reef at Sajang, early this mornin’,
their cruft did ; and in half-an-hour there wasn’t
a stick of her together. These here three coves
made a grand swim of it, but the southerly current
carried ’em down here.”
“Craft?” the other asked. “What sort of a
craft?”
“ Schooner. Banda to Singapore with nutmegs
— nutmegs, no less. And this chap-Carson, his
name is—says he owned vessel and cargo—and
wasn’t insured for a penny.”
“ Good !” and Kendall, jumped out of the ham-
mock. “I’m infernally glad to hear it.”
Shadbolt stopped cutting up tobacco. “The
fellow whose life you saved, I mean; it’s him
that’s the ruined man.”
Kendall wheeled sharply round. “ The fellow
whose life I saved,” he repeated, with a mirthless
chuckle. “ Exactly. Where is he now ?”
“Down at the village,” said the other, staring.
Kendall went inside and came out with his gun.
“Let him stay there,” lie said, “if he’s wise,”
and he marched off into the jungle.
The trader winked a wicked old eye. "Shad-
bolt, my son,” he said, “it strikes me you aint
the only one that’s been at the stingo this
mornin’!”
* * «
The rescued Carson—a sleek-featured,
fair-bearded fellow, with small, deep-set eyes—
was the man to get quietly to the bottom of a
mystery—not to make a fuss over it. So, though
he said little when the Orang-Kaya told him he
wasn’t to go near the trader’s house, he thought
the more. What could it mean if it didn’t mean
gold or diamonds ? “ The tuan's orders ! Well,
I’m a tuan myself, if it comes to that, and I’ll be
in this little swindle, whatever it is, as sure as my
name’s not Carson.’’
• # #
The white men smoked at midnight in the
mellow, firefly-sprinkled darkness, and quoth
Shadbolt: “Yes, I told Dakan to keep the chap
away, and he’s been kep’ away according. But,
d’ye see, Kendall, I think ’twould be only the
square thing to give me a notion of what it all
means, and why you’re afraid of this Carson.
Harmless enough cove he seems.”
Kendall jumped up. “ Afraid ? You’re on the
wrong tack, my good fellow—it’s he who has to
fear me! You’ve heard me speak of Parbury,
haven’t you ?”
“ Parbury ?—yes!—but this chap’s name’s .”
“Never mind names. This is the man !”
The trader puffed for a full minute before he
said: “Well, old man, I’ve sized you up pretty
well since you’ve lived with me, and I know you
ain’t the sort to get your bristles up for a trifle.
And I’ll only ask you this: Which was it—a
woman or money ?
“ Both !” Kendall said quietly, “and reputation
besides! Entire and hopeless ruin at a stroke 1”
“Yet you saved his life.”
“Pooh !—it was the doctor that saved his life,
not the man.”
“ I see. But what’ll the man do now if this
fellow should happen to drop across him ?”
Kendall knocked the ashes out of bis pipe.
1 m going to turn in.” He went half-way to
the door and stopped. “ The scoundrel’s had one
chance,” he said. “Let him stand upon that.”
# • #
Parbury-Carson was prius dementatus. In
his own most evil hap—the fact that Shadbolt
was rattan-classing in the village—he saw a stroke
of luck, as also in the chance that brought two
Dyak boys to blows over a pigeon, and focussed
on the fray the juvenile eyes that had the task of
watching the white man.
Across the yams and plantains— two minutes
hid him in the sugar-cane, and three more found
him on the trader’s verandah. A little blue-back
monkey scolded fiercely at him as he passed
through the first room and peeped into a second.
Then footsteps came along the verandah, and
Carson looked back. A tall figure with features
indistinguishable against the outside glare, stood
outlined in the doorway. The intruder stepped
back a pace or two.
“ I beg your pardon ! ” he was beginning—when
suddenly the other turned and fled.
* * •
“He followed me like a bloodhound,”
said Kendal), late that night. “Followed me. by
Heaven ! as if 1 were the criminal.”
“ Just what he thought you were, too,” Shad-
bolt said. “Somebody keeping dark down here
with a big reward bangin’ to his capture. But
get on, man, and tell me ”——
“There isn’t much to tell. The miserable
wretch kept yelling at me to stop. I had my
revolver with me. I couldn’t keep away the
thought that it ivas to be.”
“Well, out with it!” Shadbolt was hoarse
with excitement; “you dropped him ?”
“I did not. I held on, hoping to keep his
cursed face out of my sight, till I came to the
batang oyer that limestone gorge. You know it?”
“Ugh! don’t I? That stopped him, I’ll bet
my boots.”
“No. When I got across, and turned, there he
was, coming after me. Then the devil got me. I
dodged behind a dracsenia, with the pistol ready,
till he got half-way over. Then I stepped out,
and he knew me, and pulled up with a jerk—and
slipped—and screeched—and ”
“I know,” the trader said. “Them trunks is
like glass, just now. And the Dyaks say that
place has no bottom. Better so, it’s off your
shoulders.”
ALEX. MONTGOMERY.
Some extracts from an alleged Labour
manifesto circulated among the shearers and bush-
workers of western Queensland :
The Tree of Labour bears fruit only when manured
with the bones of fat usurers, insolent despots, perfidious
politicians, and blacklegs generally. . . . Parliaments
are composed of committees of opulent robbers and
polished thieves, oratorical prostitutes, and abject hire-
lings. ... If squatters oppress you plant raek-a-rock
for their buggies, also fire low and lay them out. If Shy-
locks of the bloody city fleece you, make their homes
desolate. If politicians betray your hopes and sell you
for foeman’s gold, split open their hearts. . . . Study
the science of death. Use bullets, steel, melinite, kero-
sene, phosphorus, flresticks, torpedoes, lithofracteur,
poison, blasting-powder, bombshells—any weapon you
can get hold of. There is no honour in warfare. . . .
Think like heroes, steal like Spartans, lie like hell. . , .
Blast to blazes all human tigers, &c., &c.
Vigorous. It will do at least a little good. It is
a lesson in the noble art of comprehensive con-
densation.
Editor Bulletin,—Potatoes are down to
almost nominal prices—£l to £2 per ton. Why
has nobody tried to turn them into starch ?
Potato starch is as easily made as arrowroot, and
by the same machinery and process, Australian
arrowroot has largely replaced the imported
article, why not Australian starch ?—R.
When Cambridge conferred a cheap degree
on George of York recently, a few undergrads, ob-
jected,_ on the ground that the statute only
authorised the granting of degrees to such British
subjects as were “ of conspicuous merit, or have
done good service to the State or the University.”
York couldn’t prove any good service, but the
learned grovellers gave him his degree all the same.
Michael Gately, when Vic, hangman, made
his will, in which he left all his worldly goods, in-
cluding some specifically-mentioned fees for
flogging and hanging, to Melb. Hospital. Unfor-
tunately, the gallow'srnan didn’t die when he ex-
pected to, and. consequently, no one suffered the
degradation of swallowing medicine paid for with
money obtained from the official man-flayer and
slayer.
A London weekly, apropos to the increas-
ing record of fraudulent solicitors in gaol, exults
over the punishment of a country practitioner
“ who simply got hold of the money of a couple of
clients on various pretexts, and applied it to his
own use.” The result of the little indiscretion
was five years penal servitude -in England. The
Bulletin mentions this circumstance for the
special amusement of certain Australian attorneys,
who, after doing the very same thing, are
“punished” with a few words of mild censure
from a Judge, or at the worst are “suspended”
for a year. Legal embezzlement is no crime in
Victoria, anyway—and yet the blind public go on
drivelling about “the splendid future of the
country,” as though a good climate, territory and
“skite” were the only things necessary to
national prosperity. Why are not the South
American republics fine places for honest men to
thrive in ?
A staid, middle-aged Melb. householder
lately attended a boxing contest for the first time
in his life, and caught the athletic mania so badly
that he immediately invested 30s. in a set of gloves
and invited half-a-dozen cronies to his den next
evening for a few friendly rounds. When five of
them had arrived, and while they were awaiting
the final member, the host and another started a
quiet spar which was suddenly interrupted by a
ring at the house bell. “Here’s Smith !” cried
the householder who, dropping his hand, rushed
to the front door and throwing it quickly open,
dealt the newcomer “one, two,” on the nose
and ribs successively. But the visitor did
not happen to be Smith at all, but a severely
respectable Melb. magnate who is a veritable
Fitzgibbon in the way of dignity, and who so far
fervently refuses to believe that the assault was not
a premeditated outrage, or that the middle-aged
ratepayer was not a cowardly and malicious
scoundrel.
