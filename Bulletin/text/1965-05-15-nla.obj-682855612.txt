“Whenever / thought
of sewing an
Australian white wine
1 used to find it difficult
to make a choice
red wines never seem to present
the same problem (Coonawarra
Estate is always so good)
until Clifford suggested I try
another ESTA TE wine of Wynn’s
Modbury Estate.
I was agreeably surprised —
the 1963 Vintage is superb
for as long as it lasts I won’t
be looking elsewhere.”
There are six distinct types of Modburv Estate
white table wines: Riesling, Chablis, Hock, White
Burgundy, Semilion (Sauternes) and Moselle.
1963 is the recommended vintage.

Happy With His Lot
Cam Lipski, our man at Israel’s Inde-
pendence Day celebrations in the
Sydney Town Hall, reports: A singing
rabbi yet. Up on the stage was 33-year-
old Rabbi Shlomo Carlebach, a regular
swinger, direct, and possibly only, from
the USA. Believe me, when his “soul
songs”—not just folk songs—carry him
away he is a hand-clapping, guitar-strum-
ming, orthodox Chasidic stomper. Well,
so maybe he’s not a real stomper. It’s
more like he’s jumping for joy already.
So why is he jumping, you ask? So
don’t ask. Who should be a rabbi with
a congregation and a synagogue and
sermon to preach every week when “My
congregation is the whole world” and
two records are best-sellers in the United
States? So maybe it’s not too bad. So
all right already. A rabbi with a black
beard sings the Psalms with a rock ’n’
roll beat in 3/4 time.
So how is that possible, you ask? So
don’t ask. He’s a rabbi, isn’t he? So
all right already. He doesn’t want to sing
any songs except the ones he composes
himself. So after all, like he says, “I’m
original in a world where everybody con-
forms.” So all right already. He strips
his coat and tie off when he gets going.
So even a rabbi can get hot from
clapping his hands and shouting “tra-la-
la-la”.
And, believe me, a young, bearded
rabbi carrying on like the Maroubra
stomper is way out enough to compete
effectively with The Rolling Stones for
the attention of young Jewish audiences.
So if some of the adults are not with it
enough to be “haunted or soul summon-
ed” (as the rabbi’s PR release claims) he
should be worried.
After all there is a saying in the
“Ethics of the Fathers”: “Who is a rich
man? He who is happy with his lot.”
Quirk of Nature
you do, don’t make us
* ’ out to be a lot of eggheads,”
pleaded the breezy young man with an
IQ of 162. Englishman Christopher
Robinson is the Australian agent for
Mensa, an international society of people,
whose IQ falls in the top 2 per cent of
the population.
Australian Mensa is ten months old,
formed originally from a nucleus of
about ten members who joined overseas.
At present there-are a dozen members in
Sydney, a dozen in Melbourne, three
in Adelaide, and something like half a
dozen more scattered elsewhere in Aus-
tralia.
Chris Robinson has tested for members
in Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide; and
Canberra, Perth and Brisbane will be
hit with the Stanford-Binet next. Aspiring
Mensas do a preliminary intelligence test
at home. If they shape up well in this,
a second test is given under the super-
vision of a trained psychologist. The
alternative method of entry is for a per-
son to get a qualified psychologist to
guarantee that their IQ is within the
upper 2 per cent.
Technically speaking, you would need
a score of more than 133 on the Stanford-
Binet (the standard test for Mensa), more
than 148 on the Cattell Scale or more
than 130 on the WAIS. Understood?
Twenty-three-year-old Chris Robinson,
the youngest Australian member,
shrugged off his quotient by saying: “The
International Secretary of Mensa, Victor
Serebriakoff, has an IQ which can’t be
categorised—it ran right off the end of
the scale. The people in the society
aren’t there for its snob-value, but be-
cause they feel it’s worthwhile. Other
people would probably laugh at us for
being in a 2 per cent group anyway.”
Chris Robinson explained that Mensa
is a common stamping ground for super
intelligences, who frequently find it
frustrating “sparring” with the other 98
per cent to find subjects in common. In
addition, Mensa is the willing victim of
much research by universities, and by
statesmen, who are interested in their
voting habits.
Australian Mensa, up to date, has
mainly concentrated on a recruiting drive.
“Intelligence is an innate thing—where
you’re living- is immaterial,” said Chris
Robinson. “There are 7500 Mensas in 52
countries throughout the world. If you
work out the potential, it’s fantastic—
-2 per cent of the world’s population
would be 60 million people.”
Australian members will be listed in
the next issue of the Mensa Register,
which gives a run-down of the occupa-
tions and interests of Ms. At present,
teachers and professional people domi-
nate membership here, but overseas mem-
bers include firemen, postmen, farm
laborers, steelfitters, a ditch-digger, and
a prison inmate. A nine-year-old boy in
California belongs and a 69-year-old
blind New York businessman, who took
a special test, is the society’s oldest mem-
ber. Most of the Australian members are
in their twenties and thirties.
“Mensa hospitality is terrific,” said
Chris Robinson. “You can look up
members anywhere when you’re travel-
ling and simply say ‘l’m an M’. Mensa
means a round-table society where all are
equal. Every person would qualify to
join some unique society or other by a
peculiar quirk of personality they may
have. We’ve just extended this to another
quirk of Nature.”
Primeval
Monash University zoologist
Professor Jack Marshall bitingly
blamed Tasmanian shooters for what may
be one of the concluding assaults on the
rare Cape Barren geese, he did not tell
all the story of the hunting down of
wild life. He could have mentioned the
Tasmanians’ primeval appetite for some
of the birds and animals they see around
them.

A Reply to Some Propaganda
Verses Recently Appearing in
“The Australian”
With fine rain pattering on his coolie
hat
In spring Wan Dim went walking amongst
the mountains
And heard a beggar call across a chasm:
“Stop, comrade, throw yourself in the
ravine
Before I let this bamboo spear impale
My child, poor half-starved thing with
dirty cheeks.”
“But, stranger, what good would my
jumping do?”
“I tell you jump or else I’ll kill my child.”
Wan Dim had hardly leaned upon his
stick
To say, “No, I don’t want to jump”
before
The beggar stabbed the child and hurled
it spinning
A tiny bundle tumbled by the torrent
Among the rocks six hundred feet below.
“You killed her, you have killed my only
child,”
The beggar cursed and spat, “Ah yes the
torrent
May wash the blood out from her small
patched singlet,
But can it wash the blood out from your
conscience,
You murderer of the weak and inoffen-
sive?”
Wan Dim went home, yet still the
beggar's screams
And torrent’s thunder echoed in his mind.
The villagers maintained the beggar’s
name
Was Ho Chi-minh. Meanwhile in distant
San,
The land where sheep eat pawpaws and
bananas,
Some natives told a tale of how Wan
Dim
With bamboo spear impaled a beggar’s
child.

gustedly remarked on the kangaroo meat
they have seen in butchers’ shops. Some
of them have had to gulp down their
revulsion with the kangaroo patties
pressed on them by proud hosts. (Others,
of course, have eaten and enjoyed the
local delicacy.) And the arrival of the
first mutton-birds (short-tailed shear-
waters) from the Flinders Island rooker-
ies is to Tasmanians a gastronomic event
equalled only by the season’s first scal-
lops.
The Animals and Birds Protection (sic)
Board, which permitted the two-day open
season during which the Cape Barren
geese were slaughtered, also permits a
short open season for black swan in areas
where they are in large numbers. This
year there was an early warning that the
birds had a bacterial infection which
might make them dangerous for human
consumption, but this detail did not deter
the shooters nor, apparently, the eaters.
Even the penguins cop it. They are
killed by fishermen for bait.
Furore
Stepping briskly off an Air-India jet in
Sydney, Lucjan Wolanowski, Foreign
Editor of Warsaw’s popular illustrated
weekly “Swiat” and one of Poland's best
known feature and travel writers, unwit-
tingly walked into a furious controversy
raging in the Polish-language Press
throughout the world about Australia.
The row started over whether Austra-
lian Poles are happy with their lot and
whether or not they -have lost their pre-
cious “Polishness”. Soon the controversy
developed into a general debate which
could vitally affect future Polish migra-
tion into Australia both from Poland
itself and from other countries in which
12 million “overseas” Poles are now
being wooed by the Immigration De-
partment.
The leading (and systematically cen-
sored) Warsaw papers are consistently
understanding and sympathetic to Aus-
tralia. However, Warsaw’s “7 Dni”, a
propaganda sheet issued for “foreign
consumption”, is just as consistently anti-
Australian. Emigre papers are bitterly
divided.
The row started late last year when
“Kronika”, an independent Polish-
language London weekly, partial to heat-
ed polemics on any topic, started running
its “Australian Sketches”, written with a
pen dipped in vitriol by a disgruntled
South Australian Pole. According to him
Australia is a backward, hopeless coun-
try in which impoverished Poles lead
miserable lives in waterless deserts among
ill-bred, jingoistic and hostile Aus-
tralians. Moreover, Australia is pretty
close to being a capitalist police State
run by “remote control” by overseas
“monopolies”. Not to be outdone, the
“7 Dni” ran a couple of blood-curdling
“Australian thrillers” of its own. Sample
reporting: “Polish children are forced to
drink water from streams polluted by
carcasses of dead cattle.”
Almost simultaneously, the influential
Paris monthly “Kultura” printed an
absurd “whodunit” about how Australian
Poles have been skilfully and totally
“subverted” by “emissaries of the Warsaw
regime”. Prominent names were men-
tioned and the Sydney “Polish News”
and Melbourne “Polish Weekly” were
violently attacked for “distorting” the
truth, “driving public opinion under-
ground”, etc. This provoked an even
greater flare-up and a special meeting of
Polish community leaders from all over
Australia argued for two days in Ash-
field’s “Dom Polski”. “Kultura’s” hasty
retraction counted for little.
Meanwhile, the main Warsaw papers
continue to run first-class, if slightly
“exotic”, articles based on Wolanowski’s
two earlier trips to Australia. Here, as
well as on the Warsaw TV and the “Pol-
skie Radio” (also provided with material
by Wolanowski), Australia appears as a
friendly, growing, immature but thrilling
land. “Czytelnik”, Warsaw’s top (and
“non-Party”) publishing house cajoled
Wolanowski into embarking on a major
book about Australia.
The Immigration Department issued a
three-months visa. Not to be outdone,
Washington’s State Department asked
Wolanowski to the United States on an
“all expenses” jaunt.
But Wolanowski decided that he must
finish his book first and rushed to Sydney.
“I hope that my book about Australia
will be my life’s major work,” he said
at Mascot. What he will write will pro-
bably be the most important and informa-
tive piece yet written about this country
by a Pole.
This Week’s Cover \
Tt took specialist photographer Reg
Johnson 600 pictures and 17 eye
operations to perfect the technique which
resulted in this week’s Bulletin cover,
shot during some very delicate optical
surgery at Sydney’s Royal Prince Alfred
Hospital.
Mr Johnson, who is the RPA’s director
of research photography, has developed
a range of surgical photography tech-
niques which lead the world in their
field. But like many camera enthusiasts
he really has the bug.
The cover picture, for example, was
photographed with some of the £25,000
worth of equipment which he has in-
stalled at his own expense in the hospi-
tal’s institute of research photography.
With the “right of private practice” he
also works as a consultant in scientific
and industrial photography.
Because of a*n error in reading notes,
artist Mr Irvine Homer appeared in last
week’s The Bulletin as Homer Irvine.
We apologise to Mr Homer for this mis-
take.
THE NEW GUINEA CRAZE
ffij^ulCetCn
80 Years Ago: May 9, 1885
W/’e received last week, just after
going to press, a budget of let-
ters from our special correspondent
with the New South Wales Contingent
in Soudan. These are excellent let-
ters, but, after all, the whole affair has
been such a fizzle that there has been,
so far, nothing of any consequence to
write about and we don’t propose to
inflict upon our readers mere chro-
nicies of small beer, however well
written.
fpHE force of the objections which
we urged against the annexation
of New Guinea, at the time when the
annexation craze was the prevailing
form of jingoism, can at the present
time be easily recognised. Suppose
that Australia had undertaken the
annexation of that island as a respon-
sibility of these colonies, what a pretty
fix we should be in, any time during
the ensuing 50 years, in the event
of a war. We should require to main-
tain an army in New Guinea, and to
keep a powerful fleet off its coast;
and, in order to be adequate to hold
the country, these forces would re-
quire to be at least equal to any
expedition which might probably be
sent against them. In other words,
New Guinea would have required to
be occupied by as strong a force as
NSW. We don’t think the force of
bombastic folly could have gone
much farther than that displayed by
the Annexation Jingoes.
O f °f Marcus Clarke, as
rst we hope, a long series
of Australian authors, every colonist
inust be proud, and it is gratifying to
know that a number of .the leading
men °f NSW are interesting them-
selves to organise a substantial benefit
performance, the receipts of which
are to lighten the honorable efforts
his widow is making to bring up six
children, who constitute the only
legacy bequeathed her by her talented
but too thoughtless husband.

“No Good Purpose”
Tn his report on Australian surgery
on page 21 of this issue, Sam
Lipski examines the growing concern
of the medical profession thaf inexperi-
enced practitioners are still doing far
too much specialised surgery and
that our best surgery is in danger of
becoming second-best unless there is
a greater rationalisation of the work-
load for specialists; that is, a greater
concentration of patients in fewer
centres so as to enable the develop-
ment of the more complex techniques
of advanced surgery.
What The Bulletin is unable to
report, on these and other important
questions affecting the- future of sur-
gery in Australia, is the official attitude
of the Royal Australasian College of
Surgeons. Although it is the only body
which is responsible for setting spe-
cialist surgery standards in Australia,
the president of the College replied to
a request for co-operation in the pre-
paration of Mr Lipski's report in these
words: “It was the unanimous decision
of those present that no good purpose
would be served by agreeing to your
proposals. I regret, therefore, that we
cannot assist you in the preparation of
your article on Surgery in Australia.”
Further attempts to discuss the matter
with the College were rebuffed.
In marked contrast, the distinguished
president of the American College of
Surgeons, Professor J. E. Dunphy
although pressed for time on a short
and crowded visit was happy to
discuss surgery with The Bulletin
and to advance some constructive pro-
posals for its progress in Australia.
Despite the executive officers of the
College, many eminent surgeons, in-
cluding professors of surgery, co-
operated with The Bulletin, as did
officers of the AMA. The refusal of
the College, therefore, seems all the
harder to understand. If, as many
defenders of our present system of
medicine maintain, its essence is the
patient’s freedom in the choice of his
doctor, then it follows that there is a
special burden of responsibility on the
profession to enable the public to make
the wisest use of that free choice. But
such a choice depends on information,
and open discussion of the difficulties
as well as the triumphs of Australian
surgery. The Bulletin regrets that
the Royal Australasian College of
Surgeons felt “no good purpose” could
come from such a discussion.
Academic Humbug
'T'he academic lynching of Dr Frank
Knopfelmacher was a shabby
enough incident in itself. It was only
made worse by the humbug with which
the Professorial Board of the Univer-
sity of Sydney tried to justify its actions.
A vast majority of the professors pre-
tended that they had not been riiotiv-
ated by prejudice but by a concern
with academic standards. Dr Knop-
felmacher, most of them claimed, was
not of senior lectureship standard!
Yet, according to almost all teachers
in Dr Knopfelmacher's field, his
academic performance is far higher
than that of many senior lecturers in
other fields and, in the words of Pro-
fessor D. M. Armstrong and Professor
R. N. Spann, he is “a genuine educator
of the highest class”, who teaches with
“power, pregnancy and wit”, and
arouses great student excitement in his
subjects.
The point about last week’s meeting
of the Professorial Board (when it re-
fused by 48 votes to 7 to rescind its
earlier decision) seems to be that,
having been exposed in the Press for
unworthy procedures, it closed its
ranks, stood on its dignity, and main-
tained an injustice rather than admit
and correct its mistakes. It seems most
unlikely that more than a handful of
them seriously read Dr Knopfel-
macher’s works, except one untypical,
non-academic article which had been
distributed by Dr Knopfelmacher’s
political enemies.
The interesting thing is that although
the Left wing has smeared Dr Knop-
felmacher in a terrible way for many
years, they had on this occasion the
support of the conservative fuddy-
duddies who seemed to have been ter-
rified that a lively mind like Dr Knop-
felmacher’s might rock the boat.
It is a matter of public concern that
the students of NSW have been
deprived of the services of an educator
of Dr Knopfelmacher’s calibre by such
a combination of Leftists and fuddy-
duddies. All that one can do now is
to ensure academic integrity in future
by reforming the procedures of the
Professorial Board so that its appoint-
ments are never again made on the
basis of ignorance, timidity or political
prejudice.
The Front
alarming document was circulated
to the Federal Parliamentary Labor
Party last week. It was called “Truth
about Vietnam” and was signed by Dr
J. F. Cairns. It took the view that the
insurgent armies in South Vietnam
were formed as nationalist liberation
forces and have not been directed by
the Communists.
The National Front For the Libera-
tion of South Vietnam was formed in
1960 in circumstances identical with
those accompanying the formation last
December of the Communist Thailand
Independence Movement and, about
20 years ago, Mao Tse-tung’s United
Front for the New Democracy in what
was then the Republic of China. It is
the standard Communist manoeuvre
to recruit support from the maximum
number of non-Communists, inter-
nationally as well as locally, before
proceeding to impose full Communist
rule. Almost immediately Front’s pub-
licity was spread internationally by
people such as the Australian pro-
Communist journalist Wilfred Bur-
chett, and various Communist regimes
welcomed delegations from the Front.
Dr Cairns, however, accepts the
Liberation Front as a genuine “com-
plex of Communists, nationalists and
others hard to classify”, refers to the
People’s Revolutionary Party (which
controls the Front) without even nam-
ing it as the official Communist Party,
and argues throughout that these par-
ties and the Vietcong are not under
the control of the North. He is, in
other words, continuing the propa-
ganda of people like Wilfred Burchett
and illustrating again his earlier state-
ment that the Labor Party stands on
many issues next to the Communist
Party.
This would not matter if Dr Cairns
were merely using his democratic right
of free speech. But it is quite a dif-
ferent matter when he is listened to
as a leading spokesman of the Labor
Party and the effective controller of
the Victorian ALP.


THIS AUSTRALIA
VIETNAM
The Cairns-Calwell Alliance
Traversing the Opposition’s polar points
Dr J. CAIRNS
A. CALWELL
CANBERRA —The significance of last
week’s debate on Vietnam was that there
was not a greater disparity of views
among the Labor Opposition. For once,
Mr Calwell was not using the royal
plural when, summing up, he said:
“We believe that America must not
be humiliated and must not be forced
to withdraw. But we are convinced that
sooner or later the dispute in Vietnam
must be settled through the councils of
the United Nations. If it is necessary
to back with a peace force the authority
of the United Nations, we would sup-
port Australian participation to the hilt.
But we believe that the military involve-
ment in the present form decided on by
the Australian Government represents a
threat to Australia’s standing in Asia, to
our power for good in Asia and, above
all, to the security of this nation.”
There is, of course, some problem in
reconciling Mr Calwell’s view, “That
there has long been, and still is, aggres-
sion from the North and subversion in-
spired from the North I do not for one
moment deny,” with Dr Cairns’ view,
“There is no evidence of any particular
activity on the part of the North to spur
on the movement in the South. The
evidence is quite the reverse . . . (the
evidence) tends to show that the North
has been endeavoring to slow down what
has occurred in the South.”
Curiously, the credit for the ALP’s
unusual degree of unanimity appears to
belong mainly to Mr Calwell and his
Victorian colleague, Dr Cairns. Mr
Calwell avoided the risk of a really em-
barrassing division by the simple ex-
pedient of not calling a meeting of the
Parliamentary Executive to discuss the
issue of Australian troops in Vietnam
and by announcing to Caucus without
a motion on Tuesday what the policy
was. It is understood that Mr Beazley
was the only member to express any
reservations about the policy at the
time, but some members, including Mr
Fred Daly, objected to Mr Calwell’s
failure to consult the Executive on the
issue.
In deciding on his course of action,
Mr Calwell no doubt remembered the
embarrassment which followed after he
had called emergency meetings of the
Parliamentary Party’s Foreign Affairs
By BRIAN JOHNS
Committee and Executive in Sydney in
February to draft statements of policy on
Malaysia and Vietnam. It later became
known that, despite official declarations
to the contrary, these deliberations were
by no means unanimous. Significantly, the
Left is outnumbered on both bodies,
Any Right-wing dissident on the issue
of sending troops to Vietnam would be
at a greater disadvantage expressing his
dissent in Caucus than on either the
Parliamentary Executive or Foreign
Affairs Committee,
Dr Cairns made his contribution to
unanimity by circulating a 14} fools-
cap document, “Truth About Vietnam
—J. F. Cairns”, to Caucus members
last Tuesday. The Right has never been
regarded as well informed nor any-
where near as vitally interested in foreign
policy as the Left. There is evidence
in several speeches that Dr Cairns’
efforts did not fall on barren ground. But
not all members were able to assimilate
Dr Cairns’ “facts”. The Leader of the
Opposition in the Senate, Senator Mc-
Kenna, according to Hansard, declared:
“If the bombing is continued to a point
where North Vietnam is defeated and
beaten to its knees—and perhaps de-
stroyed—America cannot stay there for-
ever. Nor can we. It is quite certain
that foreign troops ultimately would have
to move out. Who, if we did move out,
would move in? Nobody else but Com-
munist China, to which the Vietnamese
people have been opposed down through
the centuries. The result would be a
Communist government (sic) in North
Vietnam.” It must be said that Dr Cairns’
own document was not always easy to
follow . . The strategy of international
Communism is not war. It is revolution.
It is not to strike irrespective of the
conditions. It always has been.” (sic).
The Opposition might be more effec-
tive in future debates as the result of
last week’s Caucus decision to adopt a
forward-looking reform suggested by
active NSW back-bencher Mr Les John-
son. The reform will mean the estab-
lishment of a shadow Ministry of 25
Labor specialists, each concentrating on
a portfolio held by a Government Min-
ister. The core of the shadow Ministry
will be formed by the present 14-man
Parliamentary Executive with the remain-
ing positions to be filled by a Caucus
ballot. Despite resistance to his idea
from olfler members, including front-
benchers Mr F. Daly and Mr A. Luch-
etti, Mr Johnson, with strong support
from the Deputy Leader, Mr Whitlam,
and younger members of the Party, was
able to get his reform carried by 38 to
26. Typical of younger feeling on the
issue was the response of NSW Senator
McClelland who declared that the Party
was being held back by old men. But
last week’s Caucus decision was merely
part of the battle. Just when it will be
implemented is a subject for speculation.
Caucus rules will have to be altered to
allow for Mr Johnson's reshaping of
the Party structure. This is in the hands
of a special standing committee. Addi-
tionally, with memories of their farcical
19-hour election to appoint the present
Executive, members are anxious that Mr
Johnson’s change should follow altera-
tions in the ballot system. But these
alterations, after more than 12 months
consideration, have yet to be ratified by
Caucus and there are members who be-
lieve that there is strong resistance to it
from older members, including Party
Leader Mr Calwell. It has been rumored
before each of the last two Caucus meet-
ings that the question of the new ballot
system would be raised.


NSW ELECTION
Among the Dead Men
Labor's desperate worry
SYDNEY Labor went out with a
whimper in New South Wales. There
were disclosures again of dead men
voting twice in Bligh and threats of
charges of voting irregularities in other
electorates on the razor’s edge, but the
agonising poll-count showed that the new
Parliament would almost certainly be a
Liberal-Country Party Government of
47 seats, a Labor Opposition of 45, and
two Independents (D. Darby, Manly,
and Mr H. G. Coates, Hartley) working
with the Government.
The man in this election who is most
entitled to feel that the result bears scant
relation to political justice is the Premier,
Mr J. Renshaw, although the fact that
there was a two per cent gain one of
the handful of ALP seats to make
significant ground —in his Castlereagh
seat must have been some consolation.
Twelve months was little time to shake
up a complacent Party. Now there is
a good case for saying that he should
have been more brutal in his remedies
a major Cabinet reshuffle for one but
J. RENSHAW
he did dominate his only ALP con-
ference as Premier and exercised leader-
ship over the whole State Party to a
degree almost forgotten in the Labor
Party. Proof of his strength was his
forthright action on the matter of
quarterly adjustments.
His strength will be sorely needed in
the years to come. Analysis of the
election figures reveals a far more depres-
sing situation for Labor than the loss of
already marginal seats. The dramatic
loss of Wollongong-Kembla, once com-
fortably regarded as a Labor preserve
because of the “working-class” vote,
obscures the fact that at least 11
traditional Labor seats are now marginal
on this election result. These include
the “working-class” areas of Blacktown,
Bankstown, and seats like Parramatta,
Ryde (areas where the State aid issue
was very relevant because of a par-
ticularly heavy strain on Catholics to
provide schools), Illawarra (where there
was a top State swing against Labor of
14 per cent), and older metropolitan
areas like Rockdale and Dulwich Hill.
There was a swing of slightly more than
8 per cent in Redfern; just less than this
in Liverpool and Maitland; and between
five and six per cent in Auburn and Fair-
field. Still left out of calculations is
the inner industrial suburb of Balmain
in which there was a nine per cent swing
against Labor (of course, in all these
“working-class” suburbs, Catholics are
in heavy percentages). When these
figures and the places they come from
are considered against an overall swing
to the Opposition of only seven per cent,
it is understandable that Labor men last
week were desperately worried about
the future of the Party.
Last week’s uncertain days have pro-
D. DARBY
vided one thing for the Opposition
the preparation of public opinion for a
radical redistribution of electorates.
There is an obvious need for change in
a situation where the Liberal-Country
Parties, having secured 52 per cent of
the votes against Labor's 43 per cent,
still has not officially won the election.
The restoration of postal voting and the
removal of certain other restrictions in
the Electoral Act will be carried out by
the new Government. The Liberal Party
estimates that if there had been postal
voting it would have received 30.000 of
the 40,000 —increasing its percentage in
this election from 52 to 54. But the
more proximate electoral problem facing
the new Government is the City Council
election in December. The Labor Lord
Mayor, Mr H. Jensen, and new Member
for Wyong, last week warned that any
attempt by the Government to break
the ALP’s hold on the Council by re-
drawing ward boundaries, or other
means, will be resisted. The Government
sharply aware of the wide powers of
patronage control of the Council leaves
with the ALP —is hardly likely to be
daunted by Mr Jensen’s claim that the
Government can make no move for
reform because it did not seek a specific
mandate to do so in the election.
Mr Askin will not be able to delay
on wage increases demanded by State
public servants and transport workers—
the latter’s dissatisfaction helped the
Opposition vote in a number of key
seats, including Goulburn. Industrial
trouble is probably the most serious
threat facing the new Government.
Militant unions have restrained them-
selves in recent months out of regard
for Labor’s election prospects, but the
current full-employment situation and
the impending economic backlash from
a troubled Commonwealth Government
heighten the likelihood of industrial
strife ahead.
With the NSW Government in limbo
for the past week, there has been little
chance to gauge whether the senior
public servants will regard the new
regime as heaven or hell. It is no secret
that among top officials of the key
department of Treasury there was the
pre-election feeling that a defeat for
Mr Renshaw would be a tragedy. Mr
Askin’s most challenging task within the
Public Service will be to win the respect
of the extremely capable men of the
State Treasury. The new Premier’s test
will be quick in coming. In the first week
he will be thrust into the preparations
for the Premiers’ and Loan Council
Conference in June. It was at the
Premiers’ conference, held in the midst
of the election campaign, for the re-
negotiation of the tax re-imbursement
grants’ agreement that Mr Renshaw
consolidated his reputation as a financial
administrator of high order.
DEFENCE
NZ for Lend
Lease?
Finding a Vietnam policy
AUCKLAND The decision by Aus-
tralia to send infantrymen to South Viet-
nam underlines the pressing need for the
New Zealand Government to formulate
an effective defence policy—and quickly.
Reports that the Government, which has
consistently side-stepped a clear-cut
policy, is considering plans to send a


light artillery unit of Kiwi soldiers to
South Vietnam brought sharp reaction
throughout the country.
The leader of the Labor Opposition,
Mr Arnold Nordmeyer, said involvement
of the country’s limited military resources
in Vietnam would weaken New Zealand
where it should be most strong —in the
protection of Malaysia from Indonesian
aggression.
New Zealand cannot defend itself, but
it does have an army, navy and air force.
What the Government has failed to do so
far is decide on what sort of armed
forces the country should have, how
they should be equipped, and what their
responsibilities are. The suggestion that
it is considering working in conjunction
with Australian forces, even though this
is in the context of South Vietnam, could
well be a step in the right direction.
Another suggestion is that, because of
the prohibitive cost to a small country of
buying necessary arms, aircraft and
equipment, New Zealand should rent
them on some sort of lease-lend arrange-
ment. One New Zealand newspaper
editorialised: “Surely it would pay us and
our allies better if we put our defence
appropriations into a larger establishment
of professional soldiers, sailors and air-
men, and rented the hardware for their
training from the power which we sup-
port and of which we are a part”. . . This
is an interesting proposition, and one
which is very near the heart of the mat-
ter. It is quite clear that overseas assets
of £NZ79.3 million would not go far
equipping the services and giving New
Zealand independence
An indication of the run-down state
of the services is given in the recent de-
cision to buy 11 helicopters for the Army
and Air Force at a cost of £NZI million.
They possess no helicopters at present;
neither does the Navy. Two 21-year-old
frigates are to be replaced by a 23-year-
old minesweeper given to New Zealand
by Australia in 1952. Men are not
flocking to join the Army, which is having
difficulty in attracting replacements for
the battalion in Malaysia.
KEN COATES
INDUSTRY
Saltbush Steel
Whyalla strengthens
defence sinews
WHY ALLA Australian defence
sinews were stiffened with the opening
of Broken Hill Proprietary’s new £4O
million steel-making complex at Whyalla
by the Premier of South Australia, Mr
Frank Walsh, last week. When additional
ancillary works —to push expenditure
on the project up to £65 million since its
inception in 1958 are in position and
everything is running smoothly, national
steel capacity will be lifted by around
one million to 6.2 million tons plus
not counting new facilities being installed
elsewhere in the Commonwealth.
Whyalla’s new capacity stands to help
the balance of payments by making us
less dependent on net steel imports. In
present conditions of buoyant home
demand and limited exports, these are
now running in excess of £2O million a
year. Equally important from the defence
and general economic viewpoints, Why-
alla represents a vital geographical dis-
persion of our steel-making capacity
away from former concentration on the
east coast.
Even to one who has seen the wonders
of the new basic oxygen steel-making
furnaces at work at Newcastle, where
they were first introduced in 1962,
Whyalla’s smaller BOS furnaces now are
an eye-opener. Whyalla’s economics may
be involved, and cost comparisons with
Port Kembla and Newcastle are a matter
of conjecture. Until the fully integrated
work is completely operative, nobody can
tell whether it will produce cheaper steel
for Australian industry. In these early
stages of operation it is certainly not.
But the site and setting are ideal. BHP
has space to burn here compared with
its east coast works. Across the endless
stretches of saltbush, kangaroos roam at
will within easy sight of furnaces, mills
and shipyards.
Maybe there is something in the story
going the rounds of the Whyalla campus?
that the reality of the new steel works
is more of a triumph for the nowi
deposed Premier, Sir Thomas Playford,'
who deftly played the card of the iron
ore leases to induce BHP into the pro-
ject. The board of the company does
not disguise its satisfaction, but is a little
shy about courting publicity for the
achievement. Why, one doesn’t know,
because this is the complete answer to
charges that its planning for new capacity
is not aggressive enough against the
background of imports and Australia’s
development.
J. C. HORSFALL
EMPLOYERS
Bosses Who Pay Too Much
Overdoing over-awards
SYDNEY At private discussions
representatives of employers’ organisa-
tions have made a further effort to avert
more conflicts on pacts between em-
ployers and unions for over-award pay-
ments on particular jobs. A section of
the employers’ organisations is known to
favor the establishment of a liaison body
for regular consultations. Trouble over
the growing practice of employers’
groups, particularly in NSW and Vic-
toria, negotiating over-award agreements
with the State Trades and Labor Coun-
cils surfaced recently with the disclosure
that the NSW Employers’ Federation
and the NSW Trades and Labor Coun-
cil had made a substantial over-award
agreement for employees working on the
Botany plant of Imperial Chemical In-
dustries.
In the case of the ICI extensions at
Botany it was not so much the rate of
the over-award payment —£5 Bs. a week
that raised the ire of certain em-
ployers’ groups but a clause, branded as
“compulsory unionism” by the dissidents,
that all contractors on the Botany site
would have to be members of the NSW
Employers’ Federation. In fact, the
Botany agreement was the fourth of the
agreements made by employers’ groups,
which included the so-called compulsory
unionism clause. In the past 18 months
three such agreements have been made
by other employers’ organisations in New
South Wales and Victoria. However, the
Employers’ Federation move at Botany
was seized on as a non-too-subtle attempt
at poaching by one employers' body in
a strongly competitive field. In the past
the Federation has merely asked for a
fee from contractors who are not its mem-
bers when negotiating site agreements
with the Trades and Labor Council. The
chagrin that the Botany experience has-
caused highlights the complexity and
extent of collective bargaining, especially
on construction jobs.
Over-award agreements began to be
negotiated in earnest in tjie immediate
post-war boom and acute labor shortage.
It has been given impetus in recent years
by the entry of overseas companies, par-
ticularly American, in the local field.
Defenders of the practice point out that
numbers of these companies, notably in
the construction field, long-familiar with
collective bargaining and anxious to
gain a foothold in Australia, have on
occasions immediately negotiated ex-
travagant over-award agreements to
secure a labor pool. This has been done
either in ignorance of local conditions
or for short-term competitive advantage.
In this situation the larger employers’
organisations claim that it is better for
local contractors if a single local body
is responsible for negotiating with the
unions. Overseas firms themselves are
becoming sharply aware of the ad-
vantages of solidarity, which is one
reason for the insertion of the so-called


P. J. SELF
“compulsory unionism” clause at Botany.
Among certain of the employers’
organisations there is the conviction that,
just as the union interests on a par-
ticular job are rationalised by dealing
with the Trades and Labor Council,
there should also be a single body
negotiating for the employers. They
claim that only a handful of the well
over 100 employers’ bodies have the
industrial experience and machinery
necessary for such negotiations. They
enforce this argument with the proposi-
tion that a multiplicity of negotiations
strengthens the hand of unions for higher
rates. And it is stabilising w’age rates
and avoiding costly stoppages that is
their prime concern in the face of the
heavy round of losses recently incurred
by a number of construction companies.
NEW GUINEA
Money
The World Bank blueprint
SYDNEY The Minister for Terri-
tories. Mr C. H. Barnes, last week en-
dorsed the objectives of the World Bank
Report on New Guinea. The Government
accepted the specific programmes for in-
creased agricultural and pastoral pro-
duction as a working basis lor planning;
and accepted the proposals for the deve-
lopment ot manufacturing industry, tour-
ism. mining, power, transport "and
communicat ons as valuable guides for
action.
The major requirements called for by
the report are public expend ture, deve-
lopmental credit, skilled manpower and
a revision of land policy. The Govern-
ment has committed itself on the first
three points, although Mr Barnes nat-
urally did not detail particular figures.
He said the Government recognised that
increased Commonwealth assistance
would be required. It also accepted that
developmental credit should be readily
available. He promised full support for
the provision of the necessary human
and physical resources. The Govern-
ment will look for skilled manpower by
recruiting in Australia, by exploring the
resources of international agencies and
by giving high priority to the expansion
of the secondary, technical and higher
education of the native people. All this
is very encouraging from a Government
faced by other acute diplomatic, military
and financial problems. It is also good
to hear Mr Barnes acknowledge that
political independence cannot wait upon
full economic viability.
Land tenure is one of the problems
arising out of the report on which the
Government rightly has not committed
itself. Any rigid blueprinting by Aus-
tralia would make a mockery of the en-
deavors to build political responsibility
through the House of Assembly. Even
if (the Deputy Leader of the Opposition,
Mr Gough Whitlam, notwithstanding) in-
dependence does not come by 1970, the
elected Parliament cannot be denied a
major say in matters such as the period
for which land and other resources will
be signed over to Europeans. Elected on
universal suffrage, the House may see
more problems than the World Bank
Mission in concentrating schools and
other, services in particular areas, or in
interfering with traditional tenure. Unlike
the mission, neither the Australian Gov-
ernment nor the House of Assembly can
define difficulties away by labelling them
“political considerations”. Without the
agreement of the House, the Australian
Government can do little more than it
has done namely, indicate its willing-
ness to provide the wherewithal for the
sort of effort recommended by the
Mission.
J. H. WOOTTEN
HOSPITALS
In Theatre
Reviewing operations?
SYDNEY While the City Coroner,
Mr J. J. Loomes, SM, prepares his find-
ing on the month-long Wendy Anne
Purcell inquest he will have to consider
the recommendation made by Mr M. R.
Einfeld, the barrister appearing for the
Mater Misericordiae Private Hospital,
that there be an inquiry into general
operating procedure in NSW hospitals.
Mr Einfeld said subjects of the inquiry
could include possible registration of
surgeons and anaesthetists who were
thought capable, by virtue of post-
graduate degrees or experience, of per-
forming certain operations for which
“extra safeguards would not be out of
place in the interests of the community”.
He also said that operating theatres in
public hospitals might be made available
to general practitioners who normally
had to rely on private theatres.
But the coroner’s biggest decision will
be whether he should accede to the sub-
mission made by Mr D. H. Hill, counsel
appearing for the widower, that he
should take action under Section 28(2)
of the Coroners Act, 1960. That section
provides'that where, in the opinion of the
coroner, the evidence at an inquest
establishes a priina facie case against any
person for an indictable offence in which
the question whether such person caused
the death of the deceased is in issue, the
coroner shall (1) adjourn the inquest
without fixing a date for its resumption
and (2) forward to the Attorney-General
the depositions taken at the inquest with
a signed statement by the coroner setting
out the name of the person against whom
the prima facie case for an indictable
offence has been made out and par-
ticulars of such offence.
Mr Hill's submission was contested by
J. J. Davoren, QC, for three of the
doctors, who pressed the coroner to find
that death was due to misadventure.
The evidence was that Mrs Purcell,
24-year-old North Ryde housewife, died
in Royal North Shore Hospital on Sep-
tember 8 last after her heart stopped
during a thyroid operation in the Mater
J. J. LOOMES
Misericordiae Private Hospital 10 hours
earlier. Each of the seven witnesses
nurses and doctors—who were present
during the operation were subjected to
lengthy, intense cross-examination before
leaving the witness box.
As well as being the longest, most
probing inquest in the State’s history,
the 30-day inquiry would also be near
the most expensive. Two QCs, three
barristers, and a hoard of instructing
solicitors attended the hearing. The 1000
pages of transcript will also add to legal
bills, as each copy is worth something
like £250. The coroner's decision will
be handed down on May 26.

Unified libel and defamation laws?
PERTH The rash of libel suits
against newspapers, particularly in NSW,
prompted the Australian Provincial Press
Association’s triennial conference in Perth
last week to start a move that it hoped
would result in unified libel and defa-
mation laws and the end of the jury’s right
to assess damages in such cases. Several
of the 40 delegates, representing 300 pro-
vincial papers, had personal experience
of harsh legal action—harsh enough to
achieve unanimity during in-committee
discussions.
The APPA wants all news media to
get together to present the Federal and
State Governments with a proposal for
uniform laws. Delegates claimed there
was too much difference from State to
State. The motion was to attempt to
protect organs of publicity from victim-
isation “w'ith due regard to the inviolable
right of any person or group of persons
tc the protection of their representatives”.
The move to have pow'er to assess
damages taken from the juries had only
indirect bearing on what the guest
speaker, Malcolm Uren, earlier had said
about readers growing suspicious of what
they read in the Press. Rather there was
the feeling among delegates that the jury
looked on NSW papers, in libel and
defamation cases, much as it did towards
employers in a worker’s compensation
case: what is £20,000 to £30,000 to a
big, wealthy group like that?
CENSORSHIP
The Lady
Is the Act applicable?
MELBOURNE Under, of all un-
expected things, the Judicial Proceedings
Reports Act, a Melbourne bookseller
was served last week with two sum-
monses by the chief of the Police Vice
Squad for selling the Australian edition
of the banned “The Trial of Lady Chat-
terley”. This Act will not allow the
defence to call evidence of literary merit
when the bookseller appears in City
Court on June 1.
“The Trial of Lady Chatterley”, by
C. H. Rolph, is an account of the trial
in 1960 in which Penguin Books Pty
Ltd won the right to distribute D. H.
Lawrence’s novel, “Lady Chatterley’s
Lover”, in England. The Federal Gov-
ernment banned the importation of “The
Trial of Lady Chatterley” into Australia

in 1961, but the book was published in
Sydney over three weeks ago by Min-
deron Pty Ltd, and distributed in most
States. (In Sydney the Commissioner for
Police, Mr N. T. W. Allan, said he had
not yet decided whether to order action
“but the matter was still under considera-
tion”.)
Already the Council for Civil Liberties,
which has associated itself with the publi-
cation of the book, has launched a
public appeal for funds to cover the
defence of the case in Melbourne. The
president of the Council, Professor A. K.
Stout, said: “It might cost £lOO a day
to engage counsel to defend the Victorian
action, but it may be possible to send
a distinguished Sydney QC to fight the
case at a reduced fee.”
Professor Stout said a Council rep-
resentative would go to Melbourne this
week and confer with the Freedom to
Read Association which is undertaking
the defence of the book jointly with the
Council, the distributor in NSW, Mr
A. W. Sheppard, and the publisher, Mr
Leon Fink. Mr Sheppard has said he
is confident the Act will be ruled in-
applicable to “The Trial of Lady Chat-
terley”.
For the Council for Civil Liberties
this is the third challenge to the censor-
ship laws in Australia it is supporting.
One challenge is the recent issue of a
writ in the High Court by Dr J. Power,
of the Department of Government in
Sydney University, against the Minister
for Customs for the return of “The
Ginger Man”, by J. P. Donleavy, seized
under the Act, and the other is in support
of a similar writ yet to be issued in
respect of “The Quest for Love” which
is in part an attack on “Lady Chatterley’s
Lover”.
AWU
Cameron’s Case
Year-long struggle for power
ADELAIDE —TweIve branch execu-
tives and organisers of the South Aus-
tralian branch of the Australian Workers’
Union, who were dismissed from their
positions last week by the Federal Execu-
tive, plan to take legal action over
what they claim is wrongful dismissal,
and there is even talk of a rival union
headed by Left-winger Don Cameron
and his supporters. At the time of going
to press, it is understood that the men
will engage Miss Roma Mitchell, QC,
who successfully had last year’s election
result upheld in the Commonwealth In-
dustrial Court, to contest the Executive’s
action in the Industrial Court. (The sec-
retary-elect, Don Cameron, brother of
Clyde Cameron, MHR, and vice-presi-
dents R. W. Groth and J. D. Wright
were expelled from the union while the
other nine were severely censured.)
Cameron and his supporters were dis-
missed after the Executive heard charges
relating to last year's ballot in which the
Left wing gained control of the branch.
The men were charged with breaches of
union rules during the conduct of the
ballot. (These rules are being challenged
in the Commonwealth Industrial Court
by Mr Wright and the hearing begins on
May 18.) In a surprise move, the
branch’s secretary of 15 years, Mr
E. R. O. O’Connor, who was not charged,
was replaced by the Queensland delegate
on the Federal Executive, Mr W. Wilson,
The dismissals and expulsions brought
to a head the Left and Right wing
year-long struggle for power, as well as
bringing to a head the clash between the
Federal AWU secretary, Tom Dougherty,
and Clyde Cameron. During the hearing,
Don Cameron, as president of the branch
and a member of the Federal Executive
under the old regime, was in the position
of sitting in with the Executive to hear

RESTRICTIVE PRACTICES
Gimmicky
Traders reproved
HOBART Readers of Professor J.
Mcß. Grant's comprehensive but singu-
larly succinct report of the Royal Com-
mission he conducted into restrictive trade
practices in Tasmania have tended to be
crestfallen rather than shocked. The
report clearly discounts the Labor Gov-
ernment’s charge that many of Tas-
mania’s troubles result from monopolistic
and restrictive practices in the State's
commerce. Sure enough, it was a worry
that about 50 of the 70 trade associations
Professor Grant investigated were involv-
ed. in restrictive practices and collusive
tendering, but the tone of his report is
mildly reproving rather than condemna-
tory.
Professor Grant, 40-year-old Dean of
the Faculty of Commerce at the Univer-
sity of Tasmania, first conducted a one-
man inquiry, which was belatedly con-
verted by the Government to a Royal
Commission when it discovered that the
initial hearings were dangerously un-
constitutional. The Royal Commissioner
reported at length on evidence, dispas-
sionately finding that some of the naughty
practices were general throughout retail
trade in Australia, and that others,
though undesirable, probably had no very
harmful effects. Business organisations
besmirched by witnesses generally came
out without too much loss of face in the
report.
Professor Grant reserved his most cut-
ting remarks for those who indulged in
gimmick selling. The inflated trade-in
prices offered by electrical retailers, he
said, could be described only as ludicrous.
Immediate action by the State Govern-
ment in this field is likely, though most
people believe that only a handful of
potential buyers nowadays would ever
pay the marked prices for refrigerators,
etc. On the broad field of restrictive prac-
tices, Professor Grant reported that Tas-
mania should enact legislation comple-
mentary to that proposed by the Com-
monwealth. If the Federal Parliament did
not go ahead with its legislation, he said,
the State should act alone. On price con-
trol, Professor Grant was quite definite.
It was, he said, of value only in wartime
and similar emergencies. “In normal
times it can have a stultifying effect on
industries capable of making technical
progress.”

at a major Melbourne teaching hospital
the chances are that he would be called
“Mr” to distinguish him from all other
medical breeds. In Sydney, less tied to
the traditions of England, he is “Dr”
although his assistant calls him “Sir”. It

overseas, is forced by the nature of his
specialised work to rely increasingly on
a team G f w hi c h he is captain, or, as
some pre f er j t> a “committee” of which
he is “executive head”. With him in the
theatre are his assistant, a staff anaesthe-
tist, an anaesthesia registrar learning the

ant anaesthetist, a junior resident, a
senior theatre sister who assists directly

instruments and facilities, another theatre
sister, and a nurse. In more complex
operations the range of specialists is
even wider.
Now, 45 minutes after he made the
first cut, he is finished. The patient is
wheeled out of the theatre and the sur-

will not be specifically on the agenda
will be questions which more and
more surgeons are asking in papers,
seminars and at conferences, and which
recent events have forced upon public
attention. More surgeons and indeed the
whole medical profession must try to
grapple with the answers to the funda-
mental question—ls the Australian

The answer seems to be that at its best

Thts is not just a matter of say.ng that
even the best can always be improved,
but a summing up of the doubts that
some leading surgeons, local and over-
seas, have raised increasingly about the
obstacles in the way of improvement,
For a start, the most distinctive feature
of surgery here is that much of it is not
done by surgeons with higher surgical
qualifications but by general practitioners,
lust how much is impossible to say,
although some opinions put it at higher
than 50 per cent. Whatever explanations
there may be for this there can be no
question that it is often not in the best
medical interests of the patient. A court
case may focus attention on the problem

ROLEX
A landmark in the history of
Time measurement
but not all the bad surgery gets into
court.
The professor of surgery at Monash
University, Professor Hugh Dudley, put
the problem in an article last month in
the Medical Journal of Australia.
“Because in 90, 95 or 99 per cent of
cases it is possible to get away with an
operation of varying degrees of magni-
tude when one lacks wide surgical ex-
perience, either technical or in the field
of pre-operative or post-operative care,
this is no reason, argument or excuse for
doing it. Surgery is difficult and danger-
ous; its practice to a high standard of
excellence requires the diligence and dis-
cipline of whole-time activity.”
Most general practitioners who practise
surgery maintain that they confine them-
selves to simple operations, to tonsils,
appendices, and minor repairs. It is
doubtful, of course, whether there is
such a thing as “simple surgery”. Asks
one Macquarie Street surgeon: “What
happens if a GP opens you up for an
appendix and finds a carcinoma of the
bowel? Does he take the appendix out
and leave the carcinoma? Does he call
for assistance? And then there are all
the complications which can follow quite
successful operations. What resources
does the GP have for his clinical judg-
ments in an emergency?”
Having a go
>Phe tradition of “having a go” at a “bit
of surgery” runs very deep in the
Australian medical profession and is one
of its deepest, although rarely discussed,
divisive influences.
Historically, the Australian tradition of
the lonely pioneer has its parallel in
medicine. With Edinburgh and London
12,000 miles away the Australian gradu-
ate qualified Bachelor of Medicine and
Bachelor of Surgery. It was not until
1926 that the local College of Surgeons
was established. Geographically, the
argument for allowing GPs to continue
to perform surgery is the strongest. In
some country districts traumatic surgery
in the case of accidents and other
emergency surgery goes on all the time,
much of it at a standard which surgeons
grudgingly admit is “not bad”. In these
circumstances the country doctor insists
that he must be allowed to do general
surgery to get the necessary practical
experience. One eminent surgeon of
world-standing in his field has strong
doubts. He points out that there are
very few places in Victoria or New
South Wales, for instance, that are so iso-
lated that patients cannot be brought to
major surgical centres or surgeons
brought to them. In other States where
communications are less developed more
attention should be paid to the deploy-
ment of surgeons.
Queensland has set a lead here with the
flying surgeon who works as a consultant
to the general practitioner. Working with
an anaesthetist and a pilot the surgeon
covers an area twice the size of Britain.
Bringing the surgeon to the patient,
either through a flying-surgeon scheme or
through helicopter, answers the country
doctor's question of whether he should
send a bleeding patient one hundred
miles by ambulance over unmade roads.
It does not answer the question of what
he should do until that Utopian day
arrives. Nor, one would think, does it
get over the difficulty that the patient
quite often prefers to have the comfort
of being operated in his home town
rather than travelling 150 miles to Syd-
ney or Melbourne. To this, surgeons
answer that country doctors quite often
do not put the problem fairly to the
patient. Their desire to “keep their
hand in”, and their financial interests
prevent them from putting the problem
to the patient this way, “If I do this
operation here you have three times as
much chance of your complaint recur-
ring, five times as much chance of post-
operative complication, and ten times
the chance of dying as you would have
if I sent you to Sydney—Which do you
prefer?” Surgery outside Australia’s
major centres is a vexed problem and the
profession itself has shown little inclina-
tion to confront it.
Commenting on the “medical Catholi-
cism and self-sufficiency” of Australian
practitioners, the noted British physician
Sir Theodore Fox has said that while it
may be a blessing to the patient on the
Frontier or in the Outback, it can be a
curse when practised in the city. “If the
practioner in the Australian country-
side is sometimes obliged to operate when
he would rather not, the practitioner in
a city is under no such compulsion.”
Many city practitioners do have long
experience and skill, but rarely does it
compare with the specialist surgeon.
Among themselves thoracic surgeons
would not dream of tackling a gall-
bladder. Many GPs do more than dream
about it, they take it out.
In this Professor Dudley believes that
both the public attitude which does not
demand specialist care and the lure of the
cash register conspire. The National
Health Scheme under which insurance
funds and the taxpayer pay part of the
doctor’s fee for every gall-bladder,
appendix, or set of tonsils is a temptation
which, even with the high standards of
integrity and conscience generally dis-
played throughout the profession, may
prove too strong to resist. Among them-
selves doctors admit that there are abuses
of it—surgery is attempted which is really
beyond the capabilities of the doctor, or
there is unnecessary surgery. Critics of
the NHS place the blame on the way the
Government “puts a price” on just about
every removable organ. (An appendix


will fetch £22 10s., a womb £33 15s. and
a prostate £6l 55.). One surgeon sum-
med up: “The human being has about
£3OO worth of dispensable tissue.” Sir
Theodore Fox quotes a cynic—“Round
here, the indication for hysterectomy is
any woman over 40 who still has her
uterus.”
And, claim the critics, it should be
the medical profession itself which
should take the initiative in this matter,
drawing up a separate register. Other-
wise it may find that the very fate which
large sections of it fear worse than death
—nationalisation —will be introduced by
a future government less prepared to
allow it to correct its own abuses. There
are some signs that, slowly and guardedly,
there is a movement in this direction
within the profession. At the Fourth
Federal Assembly of the Australian
Medical Association in Sydney from
May 24-26 two significant motions will
come up for discussion. One is a motion
asking that a definition of “specialist” be
approved and the other asks that the
AMA “as a matter of policy considers
that future medical graduates should
undergo some special training in surgery,
gynaecology and anaesthetics before
undertaking operative surgical or gynae-
cological procedures or administering
anaesthetics or before proceeding to
practise in areas where it will be in-
cumbent upon them to carry out such
procedures”.
The suggested definition of a specialist
involves two main criteria, a higher post-
graduate qualification and exclusive prac-
tice in the speciality except in special cir-
cumstances. There may also be special
cases of an applicant being deemed a
specialist if he has held an appointment
in a hospital or has other experience.
More expert “firms”
IThiERE is still a long way to go from a
A carefully worded motion to making
it clear in practice that GPs should not
undertake surgery. Even in Queensland,
where the Government has introduced
an official register of specialists, and in
Tasmania where such a register is being
prepared, this does not prevent surgery
by the GP. The separate register merely
acts as a guide to the benefit schemes for
payment of those benefits which are paid
only for specialist services. Many city
GPs accept that only specialists should
perform surgery, but they add that a
specialist need not be someone with an
FRCS. “Higher degrees in themselves
are not the only guarantee of expertise.
If I was having my appendix out I know
that there are some surgeons I wouldn’t
let near it because they don’t have any
common sense. Obviously, in certain
areas there is just no argument that the
specialist is the man to do the job. If
dividing the profession into GPs and
specialists also means that the GP will
not have the right to treat his jpatient
in hospitals (as now happens in some
teaching hospitals after a patient has
been referred) then this will meet with
strong opposition from the GPs.
So much for the problems of surgery
undertaken by the “non-surgeons”. How
good is the man with the FRCS and/or
the FRACS? The President of the Ameri-
can College of Surgeons, Professor J. E.
Dunphy, invited by the Australian Post-
Graduate Medical Foundation, feels that
the standard is quite high. In a special
interview with The Bulletin - before he
returned to the US after a lecture and
demonstration tour, Professor Dunphy
said that while general standards were
quite good there was a great need for
the development of expert “firms”.
Specialised units have to be developed
to deal with specific fields like vascular,
thoracic and gastro-enterological surgery.
These special units would be in a better
position to accumulate experience to
innovate, to undertake research, and to
teach. The time has come, he believes,
for the development of university hos-
pitals, where all the patients are under
the control of the professors, instead of
the present system which allows pro-
fessorial units access to less than 20 per
cent of the patients in teaching hospitals,
and no access to the many patients in
private and repatriation hospitals.
“Post-graduate surgical training has
been virtually non-existent in Australia.
All but two of the Professors of Surgery
are foreign graduates and it is not
possible for a young surgeon to complete
his training in Australia. It is a tribute
to the determination of Australian
surgeons that this situation has not led
to isolation and a falling-off in stand-
ards.” There was, he felt, too much
emphasis on examination and not suf-
ficient on training in the present Aus-
tralian system. As if in anticipation of
Professor Dunphy’s criticisms the local
college of surgeons is moving towards
such a view.
The consensus within the profession
is that technically Australian surgeons
are as good as any in the world (not
“just the Southern Hemisphere”, added
one hospital administrator). Usually it
means 10 to 15 years of concentrated
study and training before a surgeon can
start operating bn his own and often up
to 10 more years before he is widely
accepted within the profession. Most of
the “miracle” operations are performed
in Australia transplants have been
attempted with some initial success, open-
heart surgery is developing, brain surgery
is undertaken with increasing frequency.
But in all these areas there are still
operations for which patients have to go
overseas. Some surgeons insist that this
will always be the case because in a
population of 11 million or even 15
million the incidence of disease which
requires highly specialised teams is some-
times not high enough to warrant their
establishment.
Others maintain that the small popula-
tion excuse is an old saw; it is basically
an attitude to research. Both opinions
accept that there is not enough money,
and both agree that really first-rate
surgery costs a great deal. Take heart
surgery. In the US a cardiac unit would
have three experienced surgeons (at least
12-15 years of experience) being paid
a salary of 25,000 dollars a year, four
or five trainee surgeons, a team of nurses
and operating sisters, a separate operating
suite (costing about 100,000 dollars),
a resuscitator unit with electronic equip-
ment and technicians to run it, and a
duplicate set of facilities and equipment
for animal research on which daily
practice occurs. All heart patients of a
certain type in any centre will be en-
couraged to go to the cardiac unit. In
Australia there is still a degree of pro-
fessional jealousy which prevents the
concentration of patients in the hands
of one or two specialist teams. One
such specialist, recently returned from
overseas, believes that the NHS has meant
the number of patients available for
general surgery in public hospitals has
fallen so low that it is “becoming prac-
tically impossible to find enough elective
surgery at the major teaching hospitals
suitable for training surgeons”. If
surgery is not to slip back both in per-
formance and in training then he feels
that patients have to be got back into
the teaching hospitals.
“Besides, I am worried when I have
to spend most of my day in my car
instead of seeing patients. I am worried
when I operate on a patient and know
that if he develops a haemorrhage within
an hour it might be three before I can
get to him again. I am worried that
most private hospitals I operate in just
do not have the kind of theatre facilities
or equipment taken for granted in
Europe or the United States. I am
worried that we just do not understand
the principles of intensive post-opera-
tional care. I am worried that we are
not paying our nurses enough, which
means that surgeons will have to put
their fees up. I am worried that most
of the clinical material available in public
hospitals is not suitable for teaching
surgery, but I am also worried that we
are not making the best use of that which
is available. More concentration of
patients, better post-graduate teaching,
more research, less timidity in getting
off our backsides within the profession—
that’s what we need. Otherwise our much-
vaunted world standing may be slipping.”
Professor Dudley points out that any
tighter post-graduate training programme
in surgery is going to mean many changes

with insistence on the maintenance of
standards of record-keeping, seminars
and clinicopathological conferences, the
grouping of hospitals both metropolitan
and country so that such a standard can
be maintained, staff can all participate in
training and more patients can become
available for training purposes; willing-
ness of practitioners to yield their
surgical cases to those whose bent and
training is in surgery”. But most contro-
versially, Professor Dudley maintains
that a proper training programme in
surgery must mean the death-knell of
what is one of its most deep-seated
traditions the honorary system. All
surgeons aim to attain staff-status at
one of the teaching hospitals where they
have a number of beds and are re-
sponsible for the patients in their units,
and for the teaching of students allotted
to the unit. Despite increasing ex-
ceptions these positions are honorary
and from two to four half-days a week
are spent at the hospital with the remain-
ing time in private practice.
Professor Dudley says that proper
surgical care and training are not com-
patible with the system as practised at
present: “It is wasteful and inefficient
and carries within it the seeds of its
own educational dissolution’. What is
needed is a system which would pay the
best staff and supply them with the
facilities to practise their profession so
that their skill, teaching ability and all
their patients are always available for
the common good”. The defenders of
the honorary system believe that staff
positions would mean the first foot in
the door towards allowing the national-
isation of medicine, and would not attract
the best surgeons.
To the layman the problems of post-
graduate training, fellowship examina-
tions, the honorary system, research and
teaching seem dull in a world where the
surgeon is constantly presented as a
magician, a conjurer whose sleight of
hand makes him mysterious, remote, and
clothed in mystique up to the eyes which
look out sternly from behind the mask.
In Australia there is added the exag-
gerated socially acceptable status of the
surgeon, the most glamorous member
of an already over-glamorised, if often
ntisunderstood, profession.
We do not think of 15 years of slog-
ging work, or the constant need to
maintain standards. The surgeon is a
brass nameplate in Macquarie St, a
house in Toorak, guineas, large cars, and
of course fear, fear that we have cancer,
the kind of fear that everyone who has
ever waited while a surgeon checks “the
tests” will know. Perhaps for these
reasons Australian patients are back-
ward in their demands for getting the
kind of surgery which is possible but
not always available.


Who Killed the Cuckoo?
Morris West’s Saigon
By ANTHONY BROWN
Maxwell Gordon Amberley, Am-
bassador of the United States to
Japan, sat with a monk of the
Zen cult in the Temple of the Heavenly
Dragon.
The Ambassador, seeking peace of
mind, was about to be reassigned to the
post of the Presidential Special Envoy to
Saigon, and, with menace and foreboding,
the monk asked: “What will you do when
they ask you to kill the Cuckoo?”
At a briefing the Ambassador was told
by a representative of the Secretary of
State: “It's a mess, Max. A bloody,
thankless mess. We call it a subversive
war; but at the bottom it’s a civil war as
well. Son against father, family against
family. We’re involved because we want
to maintain a military foothold in South-
East Asia and deny China an access to
the southern rice-bowls and the sea
roads to Africa. If South Vietnam goes,
Thailand is outflanked and Singapore is
threatened . . . We backed the regime.
But they’re out of control. They won’t
listen to reason any more. They act like
men with a private line to the Holy
Ghost . . .”
Morris West thus opens his latest
novel," “The Ambassador”. These 274
pages represent the most high-octane in-
dictment of United States policy in South-
East Asia; an indictment which alleges
official American complicity in the pro-
cess of political assassination and sub-
version of morality comparable with the
Communist power-plays for Eastern and
Central Europe in the immediate post-war
years. The charges are so hot that the
American film industry—which is at
times an arm of the State Department—
has rejected the novel as a film, although
the work could be West’s most successful
production since he sold four and a half
million copies of “The Devil’s Advocate”.
For the reporter who has covered the
Indo-China war the book may be con-
sidered an accurate historical novel of the
events of May, 1963, the arrival of Henry
Cabot Lodge as special envoy to Saigon,
and the revolt against and murder of
President Diem and Defence Minister
Nhu, events of which Max Franckel
wrote in the “New York Times”: “Wash-
ington’s real responsibility in the affair
(the coup and murder) may never be
known”.
It is this mystery which, against a
background of religious mysticism and
diplomatic morality, West coldly seeks
to explode. It will provide the Foreign
Languages Publishing House in Hanoi
with its most priceless propaganda.
Who did kill the Cuckoo? The
novelist's ‘ambassador, like Ambassador
Lodge, arrived in Saigon, a city with “an
air of musty gallic elegance”, as Bud-
dhist monks immolated themselves in
petrol in protest against repression.
It was a time when the West was
allied in Saigon with a tyranny which
was in some ways as bad as the Com-
munist tyranny it was fighting against.
President Diem, architect of this tyranny,
ruled this nation with all the craft and
capacity for murder of some mediaeval
abbots. As Denis Warner wrote: “Diem
was always right. He was the father of
the people. He knew what was good
for the people. Only the father knew
them, for the people were his total con-
cern. How, then, could he be wrong?”
He was dedicated and intense. He had
a Messiah complex. His Government
was Government in name only. His
country, already embroiled in a war of
Oriental violence, was in danger of yet
another factional war Buddhist against
Catholic.
In the middle was the United States,
propping up the regime with 30,000
men and a kingdom’s trove in money
some estimated it at 750 million
dollars a year. And with this dilemma,
the general commanding US forces told
the fictional ambassador: “We are fight-
ing knde deep in a delta swamp. Fighting
a war we can’t win and daren’t lose. We
can’t even fire a bullet until our personal
safety is directly threatened. If we take
over operational control, that makes us
capitalist colonists like the French. If
we mount a full-scale military drive into
North Vietnam, we have escalation and
a possible military confrontation with
China. If we win on our own ground
we become victors in a political and
social vacuum. If we pull out and let
the Viets fight their own war, we lose
face, foothold and all the southern
peninsulas of Asia . .
The cuckoos were killed in an Ml 13
weapons carrier on their way from the
Church of St Francis Xavier, in Saigon’s
twin but Chinese city, Cholon.
They were killed, after they had taken
Communion on their way to Joint Gen-
eral Staff Headquarters, by Major Nhung,
aide to General Minh, the Junta leader.
Their deaths did not end the Vietnam
crisis. It precipitated a series of crises
which have led to the widening of the
Vietnamese war, which now involves
most of the thinking world.
Morris West explains his involvement
in this mess of intrigue and corruption,
of sedition and religious manoeuvring, of
assassination and insidious diplomacy:
“I am deeply involved in Catholicism,”
he told me this week. “I had just writ-
ten the epitaph for Pope John in ‘Life’
magazine. I felt very strongly. The
matter of tolerance and understanding,
the question of setting yourself up as an
arbiter of another man’s sins, the ques-
tions on a reasonable kind of humility,
everything Pope John had said impressed
me deeply. This was the genesis of ‘The
Shoes of the Fisherman’. I came back out
of that climate from Rome to Australia,

and immediately afterwards—the Bud-
dhist repression by Diem. The first
Buddhists had burned themselves, and
specifically—this was the trigger incident
—the Catholic papers in Sydney took a
strongly pro-Diem line. They leaned
over backwards to prove that he could
not be as repressive as he was. The
Buddhists were not so good anyway. It
made me very angry. I rang the editor
of the paper who is now dead, and so I
decided to go up there and see for myself.
I went without intending to write a
novel.”
West moved into the world of the
Caravelle Hotel, that ten-storey hotel in
Saigon which is the haunt of newspaper-
men in stained battle fatigues, camera-
men in jungle greens, CIA men in Ivy
League Suits, eavesdropping Diem intel-
ligence men, importuning diplomats
anxious for Pressmen’s opinions, soldiers
in camouflaged fatigues, chinadoll Viet-
namese bar girls in flowing silks. “I
almost expected to see Papa Hemingway
perched on a stool in combat fatigues.”
His room was bugged, clothes and papers
disarranged and upset by searching Diem
security police. He drank at night with
the Pressmen and secret agents in the
eighth floor bar of the hotel, as the musak
played ominous Wagner and Beethoven,
and the lowering storm clouds were lit
with the flashes of heavy cannon firing in
the Saigon suburbs.
It became apparent quickly—in this
city of brazen gongs, where peanut sales-
men are terrorists by night, where the
shoeshine boy worked for Diem pblice by
day and moonlighted for the Vietcong in
Cholon —that the CIA was a potent
force in a nation which already harbored
a secret service for every arm of govern-
ment and diplomacy represented there.
The omnipresence of the CIA was
such that the fictional President Cung (in
“The Ambassador”) was forced to ask the
US envoy: “I am aware that your CIA
is in daily contact with certain dissident
elements who wish to overthrow the
legitimate government of this country
. . . I request to be informed officially
whether the Ambassador or the Central
Intelligence Agency is the true and legal
representative of the US Government
.‘. .” It is a matter of fact now amongst
the Saigon Press that President Diem
indeed requested this information of
Ambassador Lodge.
The CIA
head of the CIA in “The Ambas-
sador” is Harry Yaffa. He is unlike
the present head of the CIA in Saigon.
But he is like a CIA agent one meets
at any of the sensitive capitals of the
world. West describes him as “like a
fashionable surgeon . . . short, pudgy,
dapper and benign. His hands were
soft and beautifully manicured. His silk
shirt was elegantly cut with a monogram
woven in blue thread under his left
breast. His voice was soft. His manner
was full of charm and deprecation. He
was reputed to be devious, ruthless and
without moral scruples of any kind . . .”
West’s CIA chief—who may represent
a carbon copy of an individual as close
as libel laws will permit—defined his
function to the ambassador. “You are
the official representative of the United
States. I have to serve in another way—
as a political opportunist. There are
things I have to do that you can never
approve, and therefore it is better that
you shouldn’t know them. I have to kill
men and suborn women. I have to
foment one plot to ensure the success of
another. I have to provide against your
success and your possible failure. If you
want to salve your conscience by having
me lie to you, I can do that too . . . my
conscience, Sir, is a luxury which I found
long ago I couldn’t afford.”
West told me that this amorality, this
urbane acceptance of a national duty to
do dirty work, was the synthesis of
intelligence men—particularly American
intelligence men —he had met throughout
the world. Of Yaffa, West writes: “He’s
a first-rate intelligence man. But he’s
always too ready to act; he has no sense
of history, continuity or consequence.
Give him any situation and he’ll under-
take to change it for you. When one
action doesn't succeed, he’ll mount an-
other overnight.”
This is certainly an admirable portrait
of the CIA men I met in the Julliette
Bar at the Hotel Caravelle in Saigon.
Mr West’s indictment of the CIA does
not involve operatives of that organisa-
tion in direct accusations of plotting the
assassinations of Diem and Nhu. But
it does involve both the State Depart-
ment and the CIA in coldly accepting
their deaths, as a possible outcome of
the coup which both organisations were
plotting covertly.
The truth may never be known of
Ambassador Lodge’s attitude towards
the leaders who were about to be
machine-gunned. But West did have
access to high and respected diplomatic
opinion in Saigon, and it is to be assumed
that there is some truth in the fictional
conversations between Ambassador Am-
berley and his CIA chief.
“If the Generals depose him, will they
also kill him [the President]?”
“Kill him, Sir? The question has
never been discussed.”
“Then I want you to discuss it, Mr
Yaffa. I want to be assured that the
Government cannot be made the scape-
goat for an expedient execution.”
“Assurances you can have, Mr Ambas-
sador. They come cheap. I get them
and give them every day. But not
promises. Who can guarantee anything
when the guns go bang-bang? Not I.
I am an intelligence man professional
conspirator. You want a new govern-
ment? I’ll give you one, like an omelette
for breakfast. But don’t ask me to make
the omelette without breaking eggs.”
It may be assumed that the conspiracy
against the government of Diem and
Nhu was condoned and financed by the
Central Intelligence Agency with the
knowledge and approval of Ambassador
Lodge and the State Department.
The revolt may have been an historic
and moral necessity. The plotting
generals almost certainly ordered the
assassinations as a political expedient.
Whether the State Department could
have done more to protect its name from
the taint of complicity in assassination
will not be known unless West’s damag-
ing novel provokes the US Government
into making categoric refutations.
In the interests of the consciences of
the Allied governments and of the
Americans themselves, this should be
done. Only then will it really be known
who killed the Cuckoo.

The Affluent Converser
An awe-inspiring blend of Kennedy , Stevenson and Twain
By PATRICK TENNISON
John Galbraith came to Australia
last week a satisfyingly recognis-
able admixture of what we had
expected from his writings: the back-
woods Canadian farm boy who became
Professor of Economics at Harvard; the
wittily skilled economist who confided
that Mark Twain was (and is) the humor-
ist he most enjoys; the man who seems
to be devoting most of his life to study-
ing the machinations of capitalists but
giving most end product thought to the
welfare of the workers; the somewhat
Stevensonian, bland raconteur whose
personal friend, John Kennedy, sent him
to New Delhi as America’s ambassador.
Actually, in performance, stance, out-
look and delivery, the professor is a
sincere yet jovially awe-inspiring blend
of his two stand-out idols Kennedy and
Adlai Stevenson with a bit of his own
personal touch of Twain tossed in. In
expression and speech, he blends Ken-
nedy straightforwardness with Steven-
sonian intellectual warmth. The Twain-
ishness comes more with revelations of a
few of his academic or diplomatic
devilries:
Asked if he thought Australian
speakers at last week’s automation con-
ference that he came to address seemed
rather too unworried about automation
by comparison with the American
speakers, he dead-panned in reply: “One
of the guiding policies of Australia has
been to reproduce all the mistakes
America has made.”
Discussing some of the tricks of his
economics trade, he revealed his like of
shock word treatment in communica-
tions; he confided that when he was an
Ambassador nothing was surer of getting
action from Washington than a cable that
closed with the frank sentence asking
would the receiver back there “please
get off his arse”.
What he lacks in oratorical power is
more than compensated by his wealth of
ideas sprinkled with a natural wit he
draws on discreetly and, therefore, most
tellingly. This plus his six feet eight
inches of height add to give command
to whatever he says or does.
He is humbly blase about the best-
selling success of his book “The Affluent
Society”: “It’s surprising how many
copies a book can sell without making
you rich.” He will admit only to a
point that maybe it misjudged some of
the harmful and dire results of hire
purchase growth it predicted: “It prob-
ably exaggerated the economic dangers
of hire purchase but I don’t think it
exaggerated the social tensions and this
was the point I gave my major attention
to.”
With a gentle touch of smugness he
will also look from without on his
own clan and sum up: “The emerging
and great danger of this age is that as
talent becomes strong in scientific and
engineering knowledge and such proto-
types replace capital in importance,
these people will become a* arrogant as
the capitalists ever were. There is no
question that this is a very good period
for people who are conversant with
technological, economic and social prob-
lems and I do believe, with appropriate
humility, that they will.”
In a thrusting, energetic world he
cannot agree with some foreign on-
lookers that the Australian has any of
the national sloth —by comparison
that many discredit us with. He has
taught many Australians at Harvard and
noted no difference—nor had he detected
any anywhere else here. A bit wistfully
he will talk of the day when people
might appreciate sloth more as some-
thing of a virtue rather than any sort of
vice. He likes conjuring the thought that
things like automated and affluent
societies could induce more sloth every-
where: “One could hope that sooner or
later they might. I think the day will
come when more and more people take
a philosophical view of the accumulation
of goods.”
He believes people should always look
to the universities for initial patterns of
behavior and feels that already university
students are starting to give a lead in
this very philosophical outlook. Today’s
undergraduates seemed less concerned
about big spending on expensive clothes,
flashy cars and high-priced entertain-
ment.
“Thirty years ago at Harvard there
was great social distinction in having
a flashy automobile. Nobody today
would dream that's of any importance.
That’s a trend that will some day or
other offset the efforts of the car in-
dustry,” he adds with self-comforting
glee.
Never slow himself in trends of this
sort, he reveals with gusto that his own
car is “an ancient Valiant three years
old”. And he intends to drive it another
five before trading it in!
A keen advocate that people should be
provided with opportunities for less
manual labor, his own attitude to work
seems, at first anyw-ay, somewhat
ambivalent. Some he frankly hates. He
confesses that the unhappiest years of
his life were the early ones he spent in
dreary and repetitive farm work. Today,
at 57 years of age. he admits he has quite
a lust for the work he does, vastly dif-
ferent that it is, naturally.
His workday starts at 8.30 a.m.
reading, writing, preparing lecture
material then he teaches through the
afternoons. He considers writing very
hard work. Appropriately, this automa-
tion expert uses a typewriter for it, by-
passing old style hand writing, eschewing
new style dictation. He likes the dictum
that a good writer who dictated was
never a good writer. If anyone cites
Churchill, he points out his belief that
Church ill's" later dictated works never
matched his earlier personally written
ones.
Apart from his one gentle crack about
the Australian spokesmen's views on
automation, he was reluctant on his Aus-
tralian visit to make observations about
his host country. Too much outspoken-
ness, from this distance, about his own
country could also seem in bad taste,
too, he felt.
A reminiscence of his personal friend
John Kennedy was not only permissible
but unavoidable “Kennedy’s strength
was that he used truth in politics. It’s
not a standard commodity.” Nor, he
admitted, was the humor that Adlai
Stevenson showed in his campaigns of


’52 and ’56 —campaigns on which the
professor was a committee member. In
fact, he believes Stevenson’s humor was
a liability “Humor is more appealing
to one’s self than to other people. In
any case, it doesn’t swing any votes.”
A keen political adviser and tactician,
he has no aim to enter the political arena
as a contestant. As he sees it, anyway,
his lack of any religious adherence would
be a decided drawback to election. Even
during hi.s term as American Ambassador
in India it occasionally caused some con-
sternation always to others only. But
as he straightforwardly explains it:
“I was brought up" in Canada among
the Covenanted Baptists. They were sq
determined about it they were called the
hard-shelled Baptists. It had such a
profound effect on me that ever since,
except for reasons of marriage, funerals
and architecture, I have never entered a
church.”
Crude curiosity could not be stopped
from raising a very pertinent personal
question: How does an authoritative
economics expert fare in the day-to-day
handling of personal loose change? He
revealed that he had a problem right at
that moment. He had just returned from
visiting a jeweller who had shown him
an exquisite (but expensive) opal and he
was considering buying it for his wife
as a present. “I’ve decided to sleep on
it and decide whether to buy it to-
morrow,” he said thoughtfully, then
breaking into a grin. “I guess I’m slow
in decisions regarding my own finances
but pretty fast when it comes to other
people’s.”
The Cautious Millionaire
By J. C. KAYE
Eight cars were parked outside the
Windsor Hotel, Spring Street, Mel-
bourne, as newspaper and TV re-
porters arrived the other evening for a
Press conference put on by Mr Henry
Ford 11. As Henry Ford might well
have observed when he arrived soon
afterwards—by Ford, of course —three
of the eight were Holdens and only one
a Falcon.
Even before he touched Australia’s
shores, Henry Ford let it be known that
he was coming to examine the whys and
where-Fords of his company’s loss of £5
million in Australia last year. He seemed
quite stern about it. Outsiders can only
conjecture what misgivings afflicted the
joint managing director of the Ford
Motor Co. of Australia Ltd, Mr Wallace
Booth, and his subordinates, as they
awaited the big man’s arrival. But at
the Press conference, Mr a
6ft 3in. Tennessean who came to Aus-
tralia in 1963, sat at Henry Ford’s left
in apparent calm, while TV interviewers
took the chair facing Henry Ford on his
right, like a succession of applicants for
work.
Mr Ford’s message to the conference
was that, after four days of inspections
and talks, he was confident that the
crisis in Ford affairs had passed. He
couldn’t say when profits would come
again, but the upturn was on its way.
“We are mounting a full challenge,”
he said. “We know it will not be easy
to improve our position. But we are
here to stay and to grow.”
This was the sort of thing to cause
stockholders to cheer. No one in the
Winston Room raised a single hip-
hooray, perhaps because there are no
Australian stockholders, and the Aus-
tralian Ford concern is owned by Ford
International in Canada. However, Ford
has invested £6O million in Australia,
and its works in Victoria, New South
Wales and Queensland employ 6000
people. And Mr Ford even raised the
hopes of Australian investors that they
might get into the business not as
shareholders, but through the floating
of a debenture issue.
Cautious, as in everything else at this
conference, he emphasised the “might”.
The company does not intend to move
any more dollars to Australia, and it
seems to follow that it will raise what-
ever capital it needs inside Australia or
in the sterling areas. The debenture id,ea
is only one of several ideas discussed.
Mr Ford would not even hint at what
the others might be.
The only worthwhile news he gave out
is that Ford International in Canada will
gradually loosen its tight hold on Aus-
tralian operations. Ford here, in time,
will control its own styling, design and
engineering policies.
The background to this decision seems
to be that over-tight control from
Canada—particularly a direction to drop
Zephyr production and make the Falcon
has already caused more difficulties
than somewhat. Canadian control is
blamed —in wide sections of the trade
in Melbourne—for the fact that, when
the first Falcons came out, they proved
generally inferior to the contemporary
Holden. The Ford battle since then has
been to overcome this serious initial
setback.
Henry Ford 11, at 47, is a stockily
built man, touching 6ft, with a largish
straight nose, and a sensuous bow-shaped
mouth. His slicked dark hair is greying
above his ears and balding at the back.
He affects restrained side-boards. He
wore a dark blue suit with a maroon
handkerchief in the top pocket, white
shirt and plain, dark blue tie.
To read, he took from his pocket a
pair of old-fashioned half-moon lens
spectacles. He is left-handed, and used
the left to hold his cigarette, and to raise
to his lips a glass of water refilled from
a silver jug the Windsor provides for
millionaires, among others.
He sets his salary at 200,000 dollars
a year, and —while uncertain of the exact
amount —says his holding in Ford, with
that of his immediate family, is about
800 million dollars. .
To such questions as “What does it
feel like to be Henry Ford?”, he replies
sensibly that he has nothing amusing
to say. He’s been Henry Ford so long
he doesn’t stop to analyse the situation.
As an intellectual, Henry Ford II
doesn’t rate high. He was never good at
school and failed to take a degree at
Yale. A lady journalist at the Windsor
asked him what he thought about the
late Ernest Hemingway’s remark to
Scott Fitzgerald that the difference be-
tween the rich and us is that the rich
have more money. “I don’t know any-
thing about that question,” he replied
amiably, and without pretension.
No one asked a question about Henry
Ford’s wife since February, Mrs Maria
Christina Ford, 35, formerly Mrs Austin,
whom he married in Washington in
February, after divorce from his wife
of 23 years, Anne. No one inquired,
either, about Henry Ford’s 24-year-old
daughter, Charlotte, who also accom-
panied him here. A Ford publicity man
told me that they had been to see some
kangaroos “in the country”. And there
the matter of the ladies dropped. No one
mentioned the Edsel fiasco, nor the fact
that, because they both divorced and re-
married, Mr and Mrs Ford have been
excommunicated by the Roman Catholic
Church.
In Australia Henry Ford has moved
like a millionaire should, in chartered
planes and helicopters. One helicopter
flight took him to the Ford proving track-
in the rugged You Yangs near Geelong,
where five Falcons (assisted by a sixth)
dashed along for 70,000 miles, with

Istanbul’s Belly-Dancers
A student’s guide
By DAVID MCNICOLL
There are many people who, when
they think of Turkey, think of
belly-dancers and Turkish baths.
This is fair enough. For, in fact, these
two facets of pleasure loom very large
in the mind of the Turk living in the
big cities. Istanbul, being the most
sophisticated city, has not only the best
belly-dancers and Turkish baths in
Turkey but possibly in the whole world.
For the 50-year-old student, time spent
in acquiring knowledge of these institu-
tions provides a rewarding and quite re-
juvenating change from the more mun-
dane subjects such as Turkey’s balance
of payment problems and whether or
not she would be justified in invading
Cyprus. For any travellers contem-
plating post-graduate courses in Turkey,
I am happy to set out a few of my con-
clusions.
The Turkish belly-dancers are the best
I have ever seen. They make
their sisters in Cairo and Beirut
look uninitiated amateurs. In
the latter two cities the belly-
dancer concentrates on the
rotation and back and forward
propulsion of her navel and
lower limbs. Not so in Istan-
bul. Here the dancing is far
more active, less inhibited, more grace-
ful, and great heavens! how much sexier.
The audience reaction is much the
same all through the near and Middle
East. The audience—all male—just sits
and looks, occasionally sipping a drink.
Apart from that, the only movement
among the males is the steady and
appreciative licking of the lips.
Turkey’s belly-dancers reach a most
disturbing denouement, about three-
quarters of the way through their acts.
They leave the dance floor for a moment,
and one of the waiters rolls out, with a
great flourish, a length of carpet. The
belly-dancer then returns, and gyrates
lower and lower until she is prostrate
on the floor. Her activities for the next
few minutes would, I fear, strain the
censorship limits of The Bulletin if I
were to describe them. Sufficient per-
haps to say that it’s just too much for
many of the audience. They just cover
their eyes or go out gasping to the bar.
The queen of Turkey’s belly-dancers
is a girl Tiamed Inci Birol (pronounced
Inchy Bayroll). She is a household name
in Turkey, and if the election of the
president were left purely to the male
vote, she would give it a shake. Inci is
a girl of quite staggering beauty. Fair,
roses complexion, superb little chiselled
nose, flawless features, and hair which
hangs below her waist.
She appears at several different places
nightly, and the audience swells at each
spot shortly before she is due to appear.
I caught her at the 3.00 a.m. show at
the Moulin Rouge. She was running
late, and the natives were getting rest-
less. A female singer was going into
her sixth unrequested encore amid the
clatter of cups, and the atmosphere was
getting tense. Then there w'as a burst
of applause and in came five musicians,
faultless in dinner jackets, puffing
slightly and lugging their guitars, sax
and bongo drums. This was Inci's
private orchestra. They tuned up, struck
a note, then in came Inci. Her costume
w'as more demure than most, covered
more of her breasts than the customers
cared for, and must have cost
her a fortune. Her dance was
a virtuoso performance, and
when she reached the climactic
part of it, the modesty of her
costume, if anything, added to
the frenzy among the audience
as she tossed her mane from
the back of her head to the
front, so that it hung like a curtain over
her face, her bosom and her navel.
Inci is said to be 24, but looks 18.
Sumi, who is the second-best belly-
dancer in Turkey, declared to me that
Inci was 32, and “over the hill”. It was,
I feel, a remark prompted by professional
jealousy, though Sumi could easily reach
the same heights as Inci.
The profession pays well for the top
belly-dancers. They will get anything
from twenty to fifty dollars a night from
each club or hotel at which they per-
form. In addition, if they hang round
and let the admiring audience buy drinks
for them (they order a strange bowl of
liquid, mostly coke, plus a touch of
Turkish cognac) at forty lira a time
(about four dollars) they receive part
of the extortion money for themselves.
Top belly-dancers marry, and can
marry well. The mediocre and the
ageing, all marriage prospects gone, can
easily finish up in prostitution. I would
think the moment critique for a belly-
dancer would be deciding when to jet-
tison the plaudits and acclaim for the
security of marriage and the luxury of
not worrying any more about the hip-
line.

Butcher with
a Whistle
By GEORGE PARKES
One of the first English nouns to be
mastered by the sport-loving New
Australian is the word “butcher”.
It is the endearment he reserves for
soccer referees and, with various national
inflexions, it is hurled every Saturday or
Sunday from grandstands and outers
between Perth and Brisbane. It is only
the standard term: there are many others,
not found in the Thesaurus.
This attitude to the man with the
whistle is not exclusive to any particular
ball game, but in Australian soccer it
seems to be mandatory. Neither are
riots and near-riots unknown in other
codes, but soccer gets rather more than
its fair share. The recent mayhem at
Sydney’s Wentworth Park, where a
match between Pan-Hellenic and South
Coast United produced a really ugly fight
involving several hundred spectators and
yielding a crop of injuries, some serious,
was not without precedent, although
lately the situation seemed to have im-
proved. It is still worth saying that as
a blood sport soccer does not compare
with Australian Rules, unique for its
casualty lists. Tragic incidents like that
which put Garry Young of Hawthorn
into hospital with a ruptured kidney are
extremely rare. But wild fans invading
the field with intent to do bodily harm
is a common occurrence. If this means
that we are drifting back to where we
were a few years ago, when every week-
end saw a more or less bloody fracas, it
is time to apply sterner measures.
The psychology of the whole thing
is slightly mystifying. The obvious ex-
planations are no longer quite con-
vincing. It is still true that each game
remains a contest appealing to national
pride, with the majority of clubs bearing
patriotic names imported from Europe.
The players, however, are now mostly
a mixed lot, and it is hard to see why,
say, a local Maltese should grow excited
over the fortunes of his team when it
may include mainly Scots and English-
men. But there it is; the moment Mac
puts on a George Cross jersey, or Jan
the Pan-Hellenic shorts, they become,
to friend and foe, dinkum Maltese and
Greeks. It used to be said that the
unassuaged passions of a womanless
existence lead to these spectator .ex-
plosions, but I am beginning to wonder.
There is an almost adequate number of
females now among one or two of the
rrtost riot-prone of our national minori-
ties, and you can see plenty of girls

cheering on the ranks, not only of Tus-
cany, and not necessarily from behind.
The basic cause remains, of course,
boredom. To put it bluntly, there’s damn
all to do for most New Australians after
a dull, unrewarding working week at
the bottom of the social ladder. Our
cities have nothing to offer by way of
diversion comparable to what a poor
man may find even in Salonica or Gouda.
(It is a mistake to think that the clashes
are always instigated by Mediterranean
types.) No safety valve for frustrated
energy, no pleasant taverns, no joie de
vivre : where is normal aggression to find
its outlet?
In his novel, “The Young Wife”, David
Martin describes how entire sub-com-
munities invest their emotional capital
in soccer. After an upsurge starting
in the late ’fifties, the sport seems
again to be declining somewhat, but the
atmosphere has not changed radically.
We might also face the fact that Aus-
tralia has obtained not only migrants of
magnificent calibre, but also a respect-
able quota of corner boys. They are the
ones who get stuck into it with the finest
gusto. We live in a country in which
a person gets punished more severely for
pinching four shillings worth of cheese
than for driving an unsafe car at 100
miles an hour. No stiff sentences have
been handed out to hoodlums from back-
street espresso bars for “doing over” a
referee or throwing rocks at a player.
High time the kid gloves came off.
“Play the man”
trouble usually starts with the on-
lookers. Players may throw punches,
but it is the barracker who works him-
self up when the boy is sent off.
(Referees have much more immediate
power in soccer than in, for instance,
Australian Rules where to “play the
man” is part of the ethos.) Club com-
mittees have shown themselves incapable
of enforcing restraint on their followers;
indeed some committeemen are among
the worst provocateurs. Soccer admini-
stration is lax, especially at the inter-
mediate level, and there are no stewards
to calm ruffled tempers. Soccer at its
best is a beautiful and scientific game,
but here it still often happens that a
player for whom a high transfer fee has
been paid (“Prague”, of Sydney, bought
its Mr Blitz for a reputed £2000) is
opposed by toughies with more brawn
than brain.
Refereeing has improved a good deal
but is still below overseas standards. This
is no excuse for larrikinism, of course.
By the law of averages bad decisions
cancel each other out in the long run,
but it is surprising how many otherwise

reasonable men persuade themselves that
their side is consistently discriminated
against. Another cause of tension is that
the leagues are too small: the same
elevens play each other too often, which
embitters rivalries.
Where does law enforcement come in?
There are never enough police, not even
in New South Wales where clubs do not
have to pay for protection out of their
gate receipts. At Wentworth Park, where
trouble was on the cards, only four
uniformed men held the fort. In Vic-
toria there is the ridiculous situation
that you get as many coppers as you pay
for. One mounted one and three foot-
sloggers come to roughly twelve pounds.
Since most clubs are chronically broke,
they economise on this item: average
attendance is only a few hundred, and
overheads are high. Some clubs manage
to keep going in top company by obtain-
ing players relatively cheaply from
abroad and then selling them profitably
to other teams. Poor facilities are an-
other demoralising factor. A couple of
nice stadiums have been built, but some '
teams, especially those rising from the
lower leagues, have barely up-to-date
enclosures, let alone decent toilets.
Is there anything about soccer that
promotes violence? Certainly not the
game itself, except, possibly, that results
may hang so long in the balance and,
as a rule, are-closer than in Rugby Foot-
ball or Aussie Rules. This makes for
high tension. One missed penalty, one
off-side not awarded, may mean the Cup
lost, or relegation. We have not yet
reached the stage when, as in Sao Paulo,
the referee has to leave the field by lift
from the centre line. Our resources,
sans Sir Stanley Matthews, sans Puskas
and sans Pele do not run to such refine-
ments. We can, instead, keep the peace
modestly in tune with our modest
achievements. And they are modest
no Australian side has yet defeated visit-
ing champions, though the day may not
be far off. Alas, when Continental (or
African, British and Latin American)
name-players lace their boots in Aus-
tralia, they frequently lose their name
because they are past their prime or find
conditions rougher than they expected.
There’s a good chance that unless
mismanagement and misbehavior are
stamped out the position will deteriorate
further with the coming introduction of
a National League. (There has been
plenty of talk about a national, Little-
woods-type soccer pool as well, but it
still seems remote.) The way forward lies
through positive remedies. Better
officials, better grounds and, above all,
a better deal for New Australians on
the social front are what is needed.

Another
Cuba?
A “ Dominica ” theory
By EMERY BARCS
The Dominican uprising began as a
typical Latin-American armed feud
in quest for the fleshpots of power.
A couple of days later, when Cuban-
trained comrades who had been waiting
in the aisles took charge of sections of
the mob, the rebellion grew into an inter-
national problem. For since the trau-
matic experience with “mild social re-
former’’ Fidel Castro, the US has been
determined to prevent the rise of a like-
wise oriented lider on its doorstep. By
sending US marines to the unhappy little
Caribbean republic, President Johnson
has done exactly that.
If the Castroites had not attempted to
take over the revolution, the US might
still have dispatched a small force to pro-
tect lives. But nothing on the present
scale would have been undertaken. After
the assassination of Generalissimo Rafael
Leonidas Trujillo on May 30, 1961, the
31-years-old Dominican dictatorship
crumbled, and Washington was happy
to see it go. It hoped that it could help
the Dominican Republic develop into a
free parliamentary democracy. The elec-
tion of Juan Bosch, a distinguished uni-
versity professor and writer who had
spent 20 years in exile, to the Presidency
in December, 1962, considerably raised
these American hopes. Two previous
Presidents since May, 1961, Joaquin
Belaguer and Rafael Bonnelly, were flops.
Perhaps Bosch would be better.
Juan Bosch was probably too good a
man to be successful in Dominican poli-
tics. He was elected by a 60 per cent
majority on a programme of providing
jobs immediately for the nation’s 400,000
unemployed (about one-third of the adult
male population) and of carrying out a
land reform which would have given 17
acres of farmland to each of 70,000
landless peasant families. He also pro-
mised complete political and cultural
freedom, the curbing of the military’s
power and the beginnings of a social
welfare State.
Bosch tried to keep these promises.
But he is a hard-headed intellectual
idealist, not a nimble operator. Soon after
he took office in March, 1963, he found
himself at loggerheads with the “tutum-
potes”, the wealthy families and with the
officers who resented his probings into
the possibilities of cutting the oversized
permanent army, air force and police—

altogether 25,000 men—an inheritance
from the Trujillo regime. Although
Bosch is a Leftist-liberal who fights
totalitarianism and the excesses of Latin-
American feudalism and capitalism,
during his short tenure of office he did
try to reinforce his own Dominican
Revolutionary Party by quietly seeking
support from the three Communist
groups, the Castroite Fourteenth of June
Movement, the Partido Socialista Popu-
lar and the Movimento Popular Domini-
can as well as of the fellow-travelling
Agrupacion Politica 20 de Octobre.
After only seven months in power,
Bosch was ousted by a bloodless officers’
coup in September, 1963. With some
of his closest collaborators he was put
on a Dominican warship and sent into
exile to Puerto Rico. Most foreign
governments, including Britain, immedi-
ately recognised the new regime. The
US on the other hand, irked by the
JUAN BOSCH
failure of the Dominican democratic
experiment, withheld recognition until
December, 1963, when the new regime
solemnly promised to return to consti-
tutional democracy and to hold free elec-
tions not later than September, 1965.
During the past year and a half the
Dominican regime headed by Donald
Reid Cabral, 41, a former Santo Domin-
go car-dealer and son of a Scots banker,
has tried to achieve two things: first to
put the shaky economy of the republic
on its feet and, secondly, to build the new
democracy. Political parties—including
the Communists—have been free to
function. Reid Cabral was an inveterate
enemy of dictator Trujillo.
It seems that personal ambitions of
the Bosch group to return to power, and
not great political issues, started the
“original” uprising on April 24. What
part, if any, the Communists had played
in the preparation of the rebellion is
obscure. But they have clearly tried to
exploit the “revolutionary situation” in
their own favor. It is difficult to see
what else the US could have done.

De Gaulle’s Color TV
Soviet-French alliance against America
By JAMES BURNHAM
On March 25, delegates to the Inter-
national Radio Consultative Com-
mittee, representing Europe (both
East and West), the United States, Canada
and some nations of Latin America and
northern Africa, sat down in Vienna’s
Hofburg Palace to discuss a major prob-
lem of the next decade: what system is
to be adopted for color-TV? (With
typically contemporary irony, the open-
ing had had to be postponed a day
because of a strike in Austria that shut
down, among other things, all TV and
radio.) There were three candidates: the
American NTSC (National Television
System Committee), already adopted by
the US, Canada and Japan, the only
countries where color-TV has gone public;
the French SECAM (Sequential and
Memory); and the West German PAL
(Phase Alternating Line), similar to the
American system.
For years past the backers have been
locked in fierce psywar combat, for the
stakes are enormous. All TV in West
Europe can be linked into a single net-
work (Eurovision); there is a correspond-
ing East European network, and both
have on several occasions been integrated
as one pan-European system. Through
Comsat’s emerging project, global TV
is at hand.
The opening of the Vienna conference
was, however, an anticlimax. In Paris
three days before, President de Gaulle’s
longtime friend, the retiring Soviet Am-
bassador Sergei Vinogradov, and French
Minister of Information Peyrefitte had
signed an agreement under which the
Soviet Union chose SECAM. At a fare-
well luncheon for Vinogradov the next
day, de Gaulle hailed the agreement.
“Secular sympathy and a natural affinity,”
he went on, lifting his glass in a toast to
his guest, “constantly draw Frenchmen
and Russians together in spite of all
obstacles”.
The Vienna debate proceeded under
the shadow of the fait accompli. The
concluding vote (which is not, however,
a final decision) showed all the Commu-
nist nations (except Yugoslavia, which
abstained) lined up with Moscow and
Paris for SECAM, along with the ex-
French African countries, Argentina,
Greece. Spain and Luxembourg; West
Germany and the Central European
nations still holding out for PAL (ren-
dered, by an adaptation announced
during the conference, compatible with
NTSC); Italy, Belgium, Holland and
Scandinavia with Britain, Canada and the
United States for NTSC.
- The relative technical merits of the
three systems are difficult to judge—par-
ticularly since SECAM and PAL exist
only in experimental models. But natur-
ally the Vienna outcome had nothing to
do with technology. The vote was a
purely political manifestation.
De Gaulle s objective he has often
proclaimed it —is a Europe from
the Atlantic to the Urals”. Translated,
this means continental Europe organised,
SECAM-wise, through an entente between
France (“the Atlantic”) and Russia (“the
Urals”). De Gaulle’s games with China
and West Germany are only detours,
diversions, in.his advance toward Russia.
His reconciliation with Germany was
never separate from his French wariness
toward Germany. He knows that on
the European continent France by her
own weight cannot much longer counter-
balance West Germany, certainly not a
reunited Germany. France needs Russia
to keep joint watch over Germany while
Europe strives to match the power of
the Anglo-Saxon colossus and the future
China-dominated Asia.
Granted de Gaulle’s dismissal of Com-
munism as irrelevant, his programme is
reasonable, and in accord with his own
and France’s past. In spite of the
Napoleonic adventure, Franco-Russian
entente is the main line of French history.
The TV conference neatly reflected
the squeeze that de Gaulle’s policy puts
on Bonn. East Germany voted, of
course, for SECAM. Therefore West
German color TV (and all TV will be
color soon enough) cannot reach East
German screens if Bonn adopts the
American system, NTSC; and de Gaulle
is confident Bonn will not renounce the
East Germans. To get to them, Boon
must bow to SECAM that is, must
adapt itself to a Paris-Moscow axis. Not
surprisingly, Bonn’s Vienna vote for
PAL a system that will probably
never go into production was a con-
tinuation of West Germany’s uneasy
balancing: more or less Washington-
oriented, but hedging all bets.

NOT
ONE
OF US
By PATRICIA ROLFE
The cold meats and salads of the end-
of-term faculty luncheon were set
out on trestle-tables in the larger
of the two reception rooms of Professor
and Mrs Harry Luxton’s gem of a Vic-
torian terrace-house where Woollahra
tails off into Paddington. At the end of
the meal, which fell far short of a feast,
Marian Sharp found herself alone, cut
off by the tables from the other guests.
These, carrying murky coffee in hired
cups, began to spread out into Mrs Lux-
ton’s charming little garden at the back
of the house. Mrs Luxton, a tall, proud
ship in full sail, ploughed her way
relentlessly through the guests, splitting
them neatly into incompatible groups.
But it was unlikely that she would come
back into the house for Marian’s sake.
In the garden Will Sharp was talking
to a girl whom Marian did not know,
but who seemed too attractive to belong
to the faculty. Will was talking. Of
course Will was talking. Once or twice
he pushed back the unruly lock which
fell over his middle-aged forehead. When she was 20 Marian
had unconsciously pushed back that lock as, enraptured, she
listened for the first time to Will talking. He hadn’t even noticed
her gesture, but had gone on talking. Then, or almost then,
she had fallen in love with him. Now that girl’s eyelids might
flicker as her glance grew riveted on the unruly lock, but if
she were silly enough at one of Professor and Mrs Luxton’s
parties to reach up and brush back the greying hair of Associate
Professor Sharp, Will would go on talking. Well, Marian
thought, taking her glance away from the girl’s neat swirl of
fair hair and elegant suit, he’s saying nothing I haven’t heard
before.
She looked again at the table. Each thin slice of meat, each
weary lettuce leaf, made her feel it might have been last term’s
luncheon, or next term’s. Nothing changed. She picked up a
small patty and bit into it. Cold white sauce stuck like glue
to the roof of her mouth and drained through her teeth. She
arched her tongue to release the grease from the roof of her
mouth, but even then she could not decide whether the patty
was oyster, or, in fact, anything.
God, she thought, what a way
to give a party!
“What a way to give a party!”
someone said at her elbow. It
was Bridie Kelly.
“It wouldn’t be his religion or his politics.”
“Oh, hello, there,” Marian said without much enthusiasm.
She did not know Bridie Kelly well, although Benedict had been
in the department long before Will. In fact, when she herself
was a student.
“What a way to give a party!” Bridie said again, looking up
and down the table. “Shabby! It was never like this in Pro-
fessor Salt’s day. Darling old Mrs Salt used to make the pav-
lovas herself. And such delicious wines! These days you have
to eat a sandwich before you come so you can hear the con-
versation above your stomach rumbling. That’s if you want to
hear the conversation. Personally, I prefer my tummy rumbles.
Look at those silly looking lobsters. Typical of the pretensions
of these people. You know, the caterers take them from party
to party and just dust them off occasionally. Here, hand me
a fork. I’ll have ago at one.”
“Don’t be silly, Bridie. Mrs Luxton might come back inside.”
Bridie pushed up the sleeve of her hideous flowered dress and
thrust the fork into the lobster. “Nothing;
except scraps and that sloppy mayon-
naise,” she retorted. “Here, wait a
minute. There’s something. You have .
that. Hand me another fork.”
“The waiters are watching you.”
Bridie took the lobster in her large,
rough hands.
“The best thing is to break it in half,”
she said.
“God, Bridie!” Marian said, “the "
mayonnaise is going everywhere.”
Bridie grasped the lobster against her
chest to gain purchase. She closed her
eyes and wrenched at the lobster, but
unsuccessfully. She opened her eyes and
saw Mrs Luxton standing in the door-
way. Bridie slowly put the lobster back
on its bed of lettpce. She searched in her
handbag for a handkerchief, then very
methodically wiped her hands. She grew
intent on this, looking at her hands until
she sensed that Mrs Luxton had turned
and gone. Marian daintily put down the
claw she had been sucking when Mrs Luxton appeared.
Bridie’s flush slowly faded to dull blotches on her face and
stringy neck.
“I suppose we’d better go and join the wives,” she said
resignedly.
“Yes, I suppose so,” Marian said. But her wan gaze rejected
the wan little group of wives.
Bridie frowned at the lobster.
“Typical of the pretentiousness of these people,” she said
again. “Opening art shows. Going to first nights. Travelling
up and down the Hawkesbury in that motor-cruiser of theirs.
You'd think he was an advertising executive instead of an aca-
demic. Have you ever been on the boat?”
Marian nodded. “Oh, yes.”
“We only went once. Benedict got seasick all over the deck,
so naturally they don’t ask us again. Benedict doesn’t believe
in social life for academics. He doesn’t believe in university
people going on TV. Or writing books. Books that sell, popu-
lar books, that is. Or organising symposiums. He thinks a
teacher should teach. There’s
something so dedicated, so dis-
ciplined about Benedict. Left
over from when he was a
Catholic, I suppose.”
“Probably,” Marian said,
brushing crumbs off the tablecloth and looking with something
like longing towards the crowd in the garden.
"How’s Will?” Bridie asked. i
“Very well. Busy, of course.”
“I suppose he is. He’s got that TV session now, hasn’t he?
As well as everything else. We never watch it. We don’t have
TV. A perfect waste of time. Where is Will today?” she asked,
her long neck craning.
“I don’t know,” Marian said. She could see Will alongside
a handsome camellia bush.
“There he is,” Bridie accused. “We could go and join him.
No, he’s talking to Eric Godby. That’s Redding’s fiancee with
them.”
“Is that Redding’s fiancee? She’s very pretty.”
“But you don’t have to worry about Will talking to pretty
women, do you?”
“No, I don’t suppose I do. At any rate, I certainly don’t
worry.”


Bridie frowned at the other lobster.
She did not try to wrestle with it but
poked about with a fork. Marian wanted
to get away from her but the obstacles
of the trestle-table, the dingy, fidgety
group of wives, then Will with Redding’s
fiancee and Eric Godby, seemed insuper-
able. Poor Bridie, she thought. Bridie
had been a brilliant student, who might
have achieved almost anything. But on
graduation she had married the gay,
clever Benedict Kelly, who was now the
nervy, scrofulous man in late middle age
standing laughing like a hyena near the
back wall of the garden.
“So the committee turned down Hol-
born,” Bridie said.
“No? When? I didn’t know.”
“Last week. The meeting was last
Wednesday.”
“I didn't know it would come up for
discussion again. I thought it had to wait
until next term.”
“Honestly, didn’t you know? Didn’t
Will tell you? Doesn’t he tell you these
things?”
“I’m so remote from the university
nowadays. What with the children and
so on. And I don’t like to feel I’m inter-
fering with what, after all, is Will’s job.
There’s no more logical reason why he
should discuss appointments with me
than a business executive should discuss
details of his firm with —”
“But you know Holborn.”
“He was in my year, of course. But
I haven't seen him for ages. Not since
he got back from Russia. And, of
course, he's been out of this country for
—is it ten years? I knew there was
opposition to him, but I never thought
they would turn him down. He has a
wonderful academic record. No one
could argue against it. Although there
are the other things.”
“Oh, I know that lot. They'd have a
perfectly good reason.”
“But what? Or, rather, which? Be-
cause he’s Jewish?”
“Heavens, no!”
“His politics? I shouldn't think he’s
still a member —”
“No, nothing like that. You know the
high integrity of our academics. No, it
was probably something to do with the
cut of his suits, or the smell of his breath,
or because he doesn't know a Hunter
River red when he tastes one. They thirst
after justice for Hunter River reds’ sake,
you know.”
“There might be a few like that—”
“It wouldn’t be because of his religion
or his politics. On that, their hands
are clean. It’s just because he doesn't fit
in. He's not ‘one of us’. Can’t you hear
them at it?”
“But Em sure the majority—”
“Benedict is heart-broken. He fought
like a lion.”
“I'm sure he did.”
“He didn’t get much support, particu-
larly from the quarters where he might
have expected it. Of course, they
wouldn’t say they opposed Holborn, but
they wouldn’t lift a finger or say a word
for him. Oh, well, as Benedict says, the
Lord will spew out the lukewarm.”
Marian looked across to the garden.
“Will?”
Bridie’s thin upper lip closed over the
lower.
“It’s not that we're not terribly fond
of you both. We are. But Benedict was
so disappointed. He had such high
hopes of Will. Will owes a lot to Hol-
born.”
“It’s not what he owes. Holborn was
the best candidate they had or are likely
to get. He’s the only one of them who
has done really original work. He’s a
wonderful teacher. I know he’s a con-
troversial figure, but surely they . want
someone who can stir those confounded
students out of their complacency.”
Bridie abruptly thumped the table.
“1 get so bloody angry when I think
about you.”
“Me?”
“You were so pretty, so clever. I
remember when I was having Seamus,
Benedict used to come home and talk
about you. Marian Waters, top of her
year. Carrying all before her. And
Will was always a plodder. I remember
him. Benedict used to say, the big thing
about Marian Waters is she can think
straight.”
“But Bridie—”
“And I thought, she'll do something
wonderful. She'll make a break for it.
Then as soon as you graduated you mar-
ried Will. I was so angry I cried.”
“But, Bridie, I chose my life. I
wanted to marry Will.”
“It’s not the housework hands. Or
losing your figure having babies. It’s
losing your soul.”
“But, Bridie, I have the children.”
“You lose your soul, and you say you
have the children.”
“I mean I have the responsibility of
the children.”
“Oh, the bloody children! The bloody
children! Well, by the look of things
the party is breaking up. Thank God,
we can all go home and forget about
each other for the vacation.”
“Until the Tonks’ barbecue tomorrow.”
“Oh, God, is there no end to this aca-
demic conviviality!”
“None,” Marian said, and smiled
good-bye to Bridie. Will came and
joined her and they got in line to say
good-bye to their hosts.
“Bertha Luxton asked us on the boat
this vacation,” Will said, as they moved
to their car.
“Oh, yes.”
“I said I'd be working on the book
but we’d come if we could.”
“Oh, yes. Good.”
“What were you talking to that cart-
horse Bridie Kelly about?”
This was the moment, the moment to
say “Holborn”. But she said nothing.
Instead she flipped down the sun-visor
as the car turned to face the western sum
She caught a glimpse of herself in the
small mirror that backed the visor.
“God!” she said. Where was Marian
Waters, young, pretty, clever, who could
think straight? Where had she gone?
“What?” Will asked.
“Nothing.”
Will swerved to avoid a car. He was
a singularly bad driver. That was another
part of his laziness. He had never
bothered to learn properly and simply
perpetuated his mistakes. Now it was
too late to say “Holborn”. If she did,
he could come back with the perennial,
unanswerable, “Oh, for Christ’s sake,
don’t nag.” Or he could say, “We've
discussed this before. What’s the point
of going into it again?” They had dis-
cussed it before, but Will had led her
to believe—or perhaps she had just taken
it for granted—that he was strongly in
favor of Holborn.
She pulled a crumpled packet of
cigarettes out of the glovebox. A broken
plastic toy car and a perished splasher
fell out of it. She stuffed back these
melancholy evidences of family living
and lit a cigarette for herself. Will
nodded his head in the direction of the
packet indicating that he wanted one,
too. She lit his, waiting for traffic lights
so she could hold the match steady.
She pulled down the visor again and
deliberately looked at herself in the
mirror, licking her lips to distribute more
evenly the caking lipstick.
“Oh, God, the grey!” she said.
“What?” Will asked.
“Nothing.”
The engine knocked as Will failed to
engage a lower gear in time in River
Road.
She pulled the visor down a third time.
Where was Marian Waters, young, pretty,
who could think straight? How had she
vanished without trace?
“I think I’ll dye my hair,” she said.
“What?” Will asked.
“I think I’ll dye my hair.”
“Whatever for?”
She pushed the visor up.
“To look younger. To hide the grey.”
He turned away impatiently from this.
He stopped the car at the footpath.
“Someone's left a dinky in the drive-
way,” he said. He put his head out of
the car-window. “Phillip,” he called.
“It’s not Phillip’s.”
“Please, Marian, I've asked you not to
interfere when I'm disciplining the child-
ren. Phillip must come and move it.”
“I'm not interfering. I just said it's not
Phillip's dinky. It's Edwin’s. For
Heaven's sake! Phillip is eight. He

doesn’t ride a dinky.” She opened her
door of the car. “I’ll move it.”
Will jerked the car forward, so that
she had hastily to close the door again
and sit tight.
“Phillip,” Will called.
“Perhaps they’ve gone down to the
park.”
“I told them not to go down to the
park while we were out.”
“Yes, 1 know.”
“Why don’t our children do as they’re
told? Other children do as they’re told.”
He called “Phillip” and waited. No
answer came.
“You can get out and move it,” he
said.
She obediently got out, moved the toy
and stood while he drove the car into
the garage.
“You know, Will, next year I think I’ll
go to work,” she said, standing on the
lawn, still holding the dinky.
“What do you mean, work?”
“I could teach. I’m a graduate. Edwin
will be six in May. He doesn’t worry
now if I’m not there when he gets home.
In any case, if I did teaching I’d be home
at the same time as he is, anyway.
There’d be no need to go full-time the
first year. I could perhaps do two days
a week. I’m sure I could manage. And
I’m sure I’d feel a different person, just
being in the swim of things again.”
“I don't know what’s got into you,”
he said and went inside.
She held the dinky as she contemplated
the overgrown garden. Then she went
after him into the house. By the time
she had taken off her hat in the bedroom
he had disappeared, she assumed to his
study, the necessity for which in a three-
bedroomed house kept two of the child-
ren sleeping on the veranda, winter and
summer. The children were not home
but only a few minutes later when she
was in the kitchen preparing vegetables
they came back from the house next
door.
“Edwin, you left your dinky in the
driveway,” she said to her youngest.
“And for Heaven’s sake all of you, play
quietly. Poor Daddy’s tired. And he
has to do some work on his book. You’d
better all play in the garden until your
meal’s ready.”
She hurried the children out of the
house and turned back to the sink. It
was cooler now and quiet. There was no
sound from Will’s study. She felt more
peaceful, even hopeful. The sight of
the children had refreshed her.
The sun was setting now, throwing
back rich color so that everything in the
suburban scene seemed to stand out with
great clarity. Then she thought of Hol-
born, Holborn exiled in Lagos, his wife
dead with cancer and he with three small
children to bring up. She wept for Hol-
born, the big, unexpected tears falling in
the sinkful of potatoes.
The phone rang while she still had
her hands in water. She wiped her hands
on her apron, blotted up her tears with
a handkerchief as she waited for a sound
of movement from the front of the house
that meant Will was going to answer the
phone. There was none, so she went up
the hallway and answered it herself.
“Is Professor Sharp there?” came the
voice.
“Yes,” she said. Then, in deference to
Will’s wishes, she added: “This is his
wife. Who is calling please?”
“Oh, Professor Sharp doesn’t know
me,” the voice came, “I’m Mary Rose
Phipps from the ‘Sunday Despatch’.”
“It’s not about—”
“About what, Mrs Sharp?”
“Nothing. What do you want?”
“There’s this story in the cables about
trial marriages and I’ve got to get four
comments before the first edition goes.
And that’s in less than an hour. So
could I speak to Professor Sharp?”
“I think you should ring Professor
Luxton.”
“Oh, I rang Professor Luxton. He
couldn’t come to the phone. He’s dining
at Government House. Then the news
editor said, ring Professor Sharp, he’s a
monty. I’ve got the rest —a Catholic, a
Protestant and a Jew—and now I’ve got
to get a humanist.”
“My husband is not a humanist.”
“Oh, a philosopher will do, Mr Seddon
said.”
“Miss Phipps—”
“Mrs Sharp, I’ve only been here from
Brisbane for three weeks. This is my
first proper story.”
“I understand, Miss Phipps. I’ll get
my husband.”
Marian went to Will’s study, knocked,
and, on receiving no answer, opened the
door. He was not there. She then went
to the bathroom, that back-to-the-womb
of the 20th century. Will was sitting on
the closed lid of the water-closet reading
a paperback mystery. (Marian some-
times felt that the most climacteric
decision of Will’s life had been whether
he should be an addict of thrillers or
not; his decision in favor had set him
more strongly against some of his col-
leagues than any philosophic matter.)
“You’re wanted on the phone,” she
said.
“Can’t I get any peace?” he said
wearily. “I can’t work because of the
children screaming. Why do our child-
ren scream? Other children don’t
scream.”
“It’s a girl from the ‘Sunday Des-
patch’.”
“You know I hate newspapers.”
But he went down the hall. Marian
came slowly after him.
“I don’t think I know you.” Will w£s
saying. The unruly lock flopped over
his forehead, the voice grew deep, the
pleasant chuckle came at regular inter-
vals. “I don’t care much for this sort of
thing, you know,” he said, staring at the
hallway light-fitting. “I’ve never met
you? I thought you might have been
one of my students at some time. I
remember most of them, you know. The
girls,” he said, and smirked into the
telephone, then went back to contempla-
ting the light-fitting. “Australian women
are so much more vital and interesting
than Australian men, I feel. I haven’t
met you at the Newcastle? We generally
have a bit of a bash there on Thursday
evening. I make a point of going there
once a week. I like to keep in touch
with what younger people are thinking.
You are young, aren’t you?”
He looked up then and frowned at
Marian as she moved down the hallway
to the kitchen.
In a few minutes he came down after
her. He stood at the kitchen door,
paperback in hand, one finger inserted
to keep his place.
“If any of those little girls from the
Sunday papers ring again, tell them I’m
out, will you?” he said. “They’re a
frightful bore. They ask stupid questions
and then get it all wrong anyway.”
“Very well,” she said.
He went back up the hall and the
bathroom door closed.
Marian fastidiously peeled and cleaned
the rest of the potatoes, put them in a
saucepan, added salt, and put them on
the stove. Then she turned the flame
lower, went up the hallway and flung
the bathroom door wide. Will looked up
from the paperback, then inserted an
impatient forefinger to mark his place.
“Holborn,” she said.
“What about Holborn?”
“You voted against Holborn.”
“Yes, I voted against Holborn.”
“After you told me —”
“I told you nothing. As I recall, we
had a fairly general discussion on Hol-
born on one occasion, but I cannot pre-
tend there would ever be a time when
I would discuss fully any university
appointment with my wife. The fact
that you knew Holborn when you were
an undergraduate can hardly have any
bearing on the case, can it? I can assure
you there were just and weighty reasons
for voting against Holborn. He is a
man with no proper respect for academic
decencies—”
“But what about Holborn in Lagos?”
“There you are! Pure emotion.”
“He has a wonderful academic record.
No one can gainsay it.”
“Holborn would never fit in. He
simply isn’t one of us.”
Marian closed the door and walked
back down the hall. She carefully ad-
justed the flame under the potatoes. After
all, she thought, she had the children.
Or rather —and she tried to remember
how to think straight—-she had the
responsibility of the children.

Letters to the Editor
Popper and Stone
SIR. —In his article “Dr K in the Lucky
Country” (8., May 1), Donald Horne re-
marks in passing that the University of
Sydney once refused to appoint Karl
Popper to a senior lectureship. This is
not true. We did appoint him (to a
lectureship, not a senior lectureship
and how lucky we thought ourselves to
get him at any price!). There followed
a Press hullabaloo about the scandal
of our appointing a German inspired,
if I remember rightly, by the RSL among
others. Popper was then in New
Zealand, and, lest some kind friend
should have sent him copies of our Press,
I wrote him a letter telling him to take
no notice at all of this silly campaign.
None of his colleagues-to-be would pay
any attention to it, and it would be for-
gotten by everyone else in a few days.
In his reply he thanked me warmly for
writing, said that he had indeed received
copies of the newspapers and been dis-
turbed by them, and went on to say that
my letter had completely reassured him
and that he was looking forward with
great pleasure to coming to Sydney.
Some time before he was due to take up
his appointment, he was invited to a
Readership at the London School of
Economics, and wrote apologetically ask-
ing if the University would release him.
Naturally we said “yes”. It had perhaps
been a bit too good to be true. When
Popper was in Australia last year he
went out of his way to remind me of my
letter and to say that he still had warm
memories of his treatment by the Sydney
philosophers and the University.
The Julius Stone row in 1941, also
referred to by Donald Horne, was the last
occasion on which the Senate has sought
to reverse a Professorial Board’s recom-
mendation for an academic appointment.

Incidentally, I wrote the final version of
the Board’s protest to the Senate on this,
and I have never forgotten Alf Conlon’s:
“Alan, it reads like a piece of prose.”
Alf had an astonishing power of getting
people to do things and to do their best
at them.

Government Printer
SIR.—I was interested to read (8., April
17) that the Government produces over
2000 books, reports, pamphlets, maps,
etc., annually at a cost of over
£4,000,000. The Parliamentary joint
select committee has recommended a
central Government publishing office, not
just as an offshoot of the Government
Printer, and that a decision will soon
have to be made. The Canadian Royal
Commission on Government organisation
1961-62 examined and reported on
Government Printing and Publishing—
Volume 2, Report 9. A careful reading
of this report is justified since it points
a clear warning to Australia, at a stage
when our Government printing and
publications are following the expansive
pattern of the Canadians. I was a
member of the Project group investiga-
ting these' activities in Canada and feel
that I must add my personal convictions
to the recommendations enumerated by
the Commissioners:
Public Information Services should be
co-ordinated, with well-run Government
retail book shops in selected cities. The
Government is already informally in the
publications retail business, but the
availability of publications depends on
whether one can locate the producing
department, e.g., it took me five phone
calls from department to department to
determine the cost and availability of the
Martin report. Aggressive promotion*
marketing, publishing and retailing is
essential —this can be done through
established retailers plus Government
shops. A competitive distribution system
would force the best service from both
sets of retailers. Publishing is a role
quite distinct from printing. Depart-
mental authors often require publishing
assistance and technical printing guid-
ance on layout, design, etc.
A strong sense of competition should
be encouraged between Governmental
and commercial printers, so that we get
the best service at lowest costs.

Censorship
SlR.—Your chronically smug conserva-
tive attitude concerning politics and civil
liberties emerges once, again (8., May 1)
when you state in your editorial that
“book censorship in Australia today is
a minor matter” . . . and that there are
“only a few cases of censorship of worth-
while literary works”. Book censorship
in Australia is not a minor matter, and
there are more than a few cases of cen-
sorship of worthwhile books. The Com-
monwealth of Australia Gazette of
August 1, 1963, lists over 180 books
officially banned under Regulation 4A of
the Customs Regulations. Moreover, this
is a selected list and does not include
those not submitted to the Literature
Censorship Board. From this list over
25 books are of literary merit.
Furthermore, there is good evidence
that books are banned politically: the
restrictions placed on the US magazine
“Fact” are a case in point. Most distur-
bing, however, is the clandestine banning
of some books without reference to the
Literature Censorship Board, and without
proclamation. This has been the fate
of a number of books, including “The
ABZ of Love” and Holbrook’s “In Quest
of Love”. If you write editorially on
this subject again, please pull your head
from the sand and get your facts straight.

SlR.—While reading through your splen-
did issue of the Anzac Bulletin (8.,
April 24), I was interested in a para-
graph (p. 45) in which you quote from a
leader written on the subject, by my late
father —to whom you refer as “old
Tom Courtney”. In this sense “old” is a
misplaced adjective as at that time, he
was neither physically nor mentally old —
being at the zenith of his career —and
when many years after he died at the
age of 85, his mind was still alert and
clear.

ARTS AND ENTERTAINMENT
Change and
Develop
By J. C. KAYE
The day before opening night is not
a good time to talk to theatricals.
Their attention can’t quite get to
you. Things keep racing in their heads.
Max Bygraves, the English comedian in
Melbourne for six weeks at the Tivoli,
didn’t mean to be distant when I knocked
on his door at the Southern Cross Hotel.
But he looked down on me half-absently
as if I had asked him to autograph a
blank cheque. It was 28 hours to the
first curtain rise.
He warmed (a little) as we walked down
Bourke Street towards the theatre. He’s
a six-footer who dresses expensively. He
wore a sports-coat of large but subdued
check pattern, tightish black strides, scar-
let socks and black shoes of fashionable
length. His eyes behind horn-rims are
light blue. His thick dark hair is short
and brushed up a bit. He’s just over 40
and looks in his mid-thirties.
“Where’re you from?” I asked.
“London.”
“What part?”
“All of me.”
The old gag slipped out smoothly, and
he gave his first smile. He comes from
Bermondsey, but has a polished neutral
accent.
Near the theatre a quartet of young
men passed us, their hair almost to their
shoulders.
Max Bygraves looked around at them.
“If they were my daughters,” he said,
mimicking a shocked mother.
Whatever had been worrying him must
have begun to ease from his mind, be-
cause he found he could give me more of
his attention. He stood outside the
theatre and sang a few lines from a
special song about Melbourne from the
show.
It’s about six o’clock closing. The part
I remember went:
If you are not a resident
You can even be president
But when the clock has struck six
You can't get a dram.
I suppose it was something to have a
personal performance from a fellow who
earns £lOO,OOO sterling a year as an
entertainer, the highest paid person on
the British boards. London reports, a
while ago, said he would get more than
£3OOO sterling a week in Australia. “They
must have sent my telephone number by
mistake,” he said. “It’s not as much as
that.”
Max Bygraves and his son Anthony,
19, who is shorter and slimmer than his
dad, but looks like him, carry the second
half of the Tivoli show. The others in
Bygraves’ unit are his manager, Jock
Jacobsen, who has handled him for 19
years, a pianist, Bob Dixon, and a drum-
mer, Martin Aston.
The Tivoli bill also includes the Dell-
tones and the De Troy troupe of comi-
cal performing chimpanzees. The show
goes to Sydney next, for a five-week
season.
In Melbourne with the comedian are
the other members of his immediate
family—his wife, Blossom, a titian-haired
woman of simple charm who was- once
a cook in the RAF; and two daughters,
Maxine 14, and Christine 21. Christine,
who is a widow, has her two children,
Louise, two, and Michael, nine months,
with her.
Max Bygraves was once a turner and
fitter. He always liked to clown and
sing. He found outlets for his talent in
the RAF. When the war ended, he says,
he “didn't fancy work”, so tried his luck
as an entertainer.
Jock Jacobsen (as Jacobsen recalls it
now) spotted potential talent in the
cheerful young man at once. In the 19
years they have been together, Bygraves
has grown from a comic with a 15-
minute act to a major entertainer who
can hold a big house for more than an
hour.
He has been in 16 Royal Command
performances, and has twice been invited
to give private shows for the Royal
family. He’s had successes in straight
plays, TV, pantomime, recording and
films.
“In all my years on the stage I’ve never
lost money for any management,” he
told me. His secret, he says, has been to
keep changing and developing. Nothing
fixed. He’s billed as “Mr Versatility”.
He has toured in America with Judy
Garland and Betty Hutton. He has
succeeded in cabaret in Italy. He has
come to Australia from a tour of South
Africa which, according to Jock Jacob-
sen, was so successful that bookings had
to be extended. His scriptwriters include
Spike Milligan and Eric Sykes.
The comedian hasn’t sided with British
entertainers who have refused to play to
segregated audiences in South Africa.
“We’re not interested in politics,” Jock
Jacobsen told me. “We’re in the enter-
tainment business.”
London in
Melbourne
By BATMAN
Those of us who were raised quietly
in the calm of Melbourne suburbia
tend to be terrified of sex symbols.
Before I set out on the assignment I
looked up the file on Julie London. It
pointed out that Miss London’s voice was
husky, breathy, haunting, sultry, intimate,
sullen, sad and that she made half-
whispered chants of amour. In the
performance of the night before clearly
she had shocked the blushing critic of
the “Sun News-Pictorial”. In the noble
chandelier room of dear old Menzies
Hotel she had stripped to a leotard. The
critic wrote: “You spoiled everything.
You slipped off the gold skirt below that
incredibly low-cut gold-cupped upper bit
. . . and away went our Julie, away went
her dignity, her personality, her warmth,
her intimacy, her style . .. Julie, put your
skirt back on.”
All this was most revealing. My main
knowledge of Julie London covered the
field that she was always appearing in
a gorgeous Smirnoff vodka ad. above
the caption “Who made the orange more
tempting than the apple?” and that she
was always making Marlboro TV cigar-
ette ads sound like half-whispered chants
of amour. The foyer of Menzies was
decorated with Julie London record
covers. - One showed her looking rather
naked under an ermine coat and sur-
rounded by champagne and diamonds.
The title was “WHATEVER JULIE
WANTS.. ”
More timid than ever I knocked at
the door of her suite. The time was 11.30


a.m. The next message I received was
from Julie’s three-year-old daughter,
Kelly. She had turned the shower recess
of one of the bathrooms into a doll's
house. There was a rug on the floor, no
drips were coming from above and it
looked very cosy.
Back in the sitting-room I waited. In
came Julie barefooted, hair askew, in a
pink dressing - gown. “Ohhh, I got
ptomaine last night. I look frightful.
I'll turn the other way so that you won't
have to look at my awful face.” Actually
I hadn't personally met a sex symbol
before, but she looked’less than middling
awful. Indeed, for a 38-year-old mother
of five she looked extraordinarily comely.
Her voice was warm, husky, downright
smoke-laden. Maybe this was due to the
cigarettes. There were some loyal cartons
of Marlboro on the mantel but I noticed
she was smoking Paxton filters. “Ahhh,
you’ve met Kelly, I see,” she said. “Keily
always goes with me everywhere. Mar-
vellous, she’s no trouble. Back in the
States I take the twins as well. They’re
two. And in school holidays I take all
five of them. You know, New York,
Boston, Las Vegas, Tallahassee.”
Observing the nice line of her ankle
around to her pretty pink toenails I
tried to think of a vital question: “Er-I
only really know you through vodka.
Advertisements, that is.” “Yes, I remem-
ber that. This agency came to me and
said the ad. would appear on a page in
“Life” and one place else. What hap-
pens? For the next six months wherever
1 go, every liquor store, there I am push-
ing vodka.” “You push Marlboro cigar-
ettes too, though?”
“I’ve been doing that for eight or nine
years. You've no idea what a production
they are. We do two in two days,
starting at 8 in the morning and finishing
at eight at night. Then it comes out in
three varieties, 60-second, 40-second and
20-second. First you do the music, then
you have to mime the mouth movements
to the sound. Half the time I don’t know
whether I’m on the 60 or the 20-second
bit. Sends me dizzy.”
Then, of course, doing an album like
“London by Night” was even a greater
agony. “I can't read music at all, you
see. So first I have to spend four days
with a music teacher just getting them
right. We do four songs at a time and
that takes two days. You know what
happens with recording. Take after
take after take. One moment the orches-
tra is right but I'm wrong, then I'm right
and the piano's wrong. Everything's right
and the tape's wrong.”
John Abate, Julie's guitarist who was
sitting in the corner, said: “I remember
Crazy Guckenheim doing a disc in New
York ... 37 takes. Then they didn't get
it. They had to piece a couple of tapes
together.”
Her hair was really very nice, I
thought. Blonde, not red like in the
Smirnoff ad., and as I mused I noticed
that the general conversation had
switched on to a different tack. “The
nightclub act routine is still big, isn’t it,
Don,” she said to Don Bagley, her music
director. “But not nearly what it was.
There aren't so many places now, Ameri-
cana in New York; Ambassador, Los
Angeles; The Drake, Chicago: Flamingo,
Las Vegas. Others don't want to pay the
prices any more.”
It was high time to bring the subject
around to sex. Timidly I asked. “Ahh
. . . do you like these sexy record
covers?” “They’re not so much sexy any
more really. Though one of my records
started that trend for sexy covers.”
“Were you wearing . . . er, not wear-
ing . . .?” “No, the cover had just my
face on it. It was just the look, really.”
“What about your act here? Were you
upset about the criticism of taking off
your skirt?” “I wasn't upset. I was
startled. I do that act all over the
world. No one has ever objected be-
fore, except here in Melbourne. Would
you object?”
The old fear returned. It was high
time to get back to suburbia.
Honor and
Esteem
By MARY CORRINGHAM
Oydney University’s Fisher Library is
currently showing a selection of its
mediaeval manuscripts. The Fisher owns
nearly half the mediaeval manuscripts in
this country, but the old Fisher lacked
facilities for display.
The new building, however, is well
equipped and the current exhibition was
organised “to express the honor and
esteem in which the University holds the
name of a great book collector”.
The collector was, of course, the Uni-
versity’s great benefactor, Sir Charles
Nicholson, who worked unceasingly for
the University in its formative years, and
was its Chancellor from 1854-1862.
As well as providing the valuable
Egyptian and Etruscan antiquities form-
ing the nucleus of the Nicholson Mus-
eum Sir Charles built up the Fisher
Library's basic collection during his life-
time, and bequeathed it manuscripts, in-
cunabula and 4000 volumes from his
personal library.
The current display bears witness to
the catholic tastes of Sir Charles. The
oldest exhibit is probably a goat-skin roll
in Hebrew, thought to be of the 9th or
10th century and containing portion of
Genesis.
Next in date is a parchment roll, 72
feet in length, containing the whole of
the Pentateuch. The script is in different
hands, and is said to have been written
in the 10th or 11th century. It belonged
in all probability to Karaite Jews, a sect
which rejects the traditional law as it is
fixed in the Talmud, and recognises only
the five books of Moses as binding. The
age of this manuscript is claimed to be
“not exceeded, except for a very short
interval, by any similar document in the
old world”.
One of the rarest books on view is a
volume of the Decretals of Gratian con-
cerning the first part of the Canon Law.
It was published in Venice in 1489. The
exhibition also contains two volumes of
the 6th Book of Decretals by Pope Boni-
face VIII which supplements the Dec-
retals of Gratian and Pope Gregory IX
with a commentary or glosses by
Johannes Andreae, Professor of Canon
Law as the University of Bologna. The
earlier volume is a fine MS on vellum,
circa 1370, superbly illuminated. The
later volume, printed at Venice by Nico-
las Jensen in 1476, shows how the de-
sign of the early printed book bears a
close relationship to that of the manu-
script.
Other interesting incunabula include
a copy of “De Contemptu Mundi”, an
autobiographical work by Petrarch, from
the press of Gerard Leeu. Antwerp, 1489;.
a copy of “On the benealogy of the god”,
by Boccaccio from the press of Bonetus
Locatelli, Venice, 1494; and a copy,
printed in Venice in 1484. of an astrolo-
gical work by Claudius Ptolomaeus, the
celebrated Alexandrian astronomer, geo-
grapher and mathematician of the second
century AD, whose astronomical system
prevailed until it was displaced by that
of Copernicus 1400 years later.
FILMS
A Russian Hamlet
Hamlet. Director, Grigori Kosintsev. Savoy
Theatre, Sydney.
Kosintsev's Russian version of ‘ Hamlet”
seems to me to make an almost per-
fect fusion of play and film. The speeches
have been cut and sometimes transposed
(in time, not in character), but not
enough to remove the play’s poetry.
Kosintsev uses his camera to interpret the
play and give it a fluid mobility.
The wordless opening is breath-
taking: a bell tolls as black flags appear
in the windows of the sea-girt castle, and
the prince rides home at a gallop to be
met by his weeping mother. Astounding,
too, the appearance of the ghost; Hamlet
cringes against a stone wall as if blasted,
terrified horses break out of their stalls
and at last we see the enormous mailed
figure of the dead king, his black cloak
streaming against .the night.
Everyone has his own personal idea

'I
of how the part of Hamlet should be
played. Innokenti Smokhtunovsky
seemed to me to give a fine, profoundly
understanding interpretation, with flashes
of wit and even gaiety to hint at the
man he was before his father’s murder;
and he makes it clear without histrionic
ravings that, though he feigns madness
for his own purpose, he is literally being
driven mad by grief and rage.
The other outstanding performance is
that of Mikhail Nazvanov as Claudius-
lustful, ambitious, evil, he is never
merely the usurper of whom Hamlet hap-
pens to be jealous. Shostakovich’s musi-
cal score is regal, haughty yet not over-
obtrusive.
Without taking anything from the
play’s timeless significance, Kosintsev has
put it firmly in its historical setting. The
castle of Elsinore is not only solid, im-
posing, it is clearly a place in which
people live, eat, sleep, work—not just
an impressive background for murders
and soliloquies; the director constantly
reminds his audience that on the out-
skirts of the tragedy there are ordinary
people who will go on with their lives
after it is over.

Austere Sibelius
Sydney Symphony Orchestra. Conductor,
Paavo Berglund. Town Hall, Sydney.
Finnish-born conductor Paavo Berglund
conducted two Sibelius works at the
Sydney Town Hall last week in the ABC
Subscription Series. Mr Berglund was not
only conducting the Sydney Symphony
Orchestra for the first time, but we were
privileged to have him here to give spe-
cial meaning to his countryman’s works
as a contribution to the world-wide cen-
tenary celebration of Sibelius’ birth.
The programme opened with Sibelius’
symphonic fantasy “Pohjola’s Daughter”,
a work based on a bizarre tale from the
Finnish national epic “Kalevala”. Sibelius
was presented, without any doubt, at its
very best and it was not hard to feel the
inspiration behind it—the influences of
the austere land and the charm of natural
beauty combined with legend. The or-
chestra under Berglund’s authoritative
direction played with almost cold pre-
cision which added to the Sibelius canvas.
The Symphony No. 4 in A Minor
which followed was played with the same
austere precision. Its broad effects and
impressionistic style, which set it off
from the First Symphony, were a feast
of power and originality.
After the interval, pianist Jorge Bolet
played Brahms’ Concerto in B Flat
Major. What impressed most here was
Bolet's masterly control of contrast. Bolet
played Brahms well and truly as music
without literary or pictorial suggestions.
Brahms emerged with all his logic of
form and his pleas for recognition of his
special beauty.
John Painter’s beautiful ’cello-playing
and his solo and rapport with Bolet were
impressive and Bolet recognised this by
thanking him publicly after the perform-
ance.

Hot Summer Night. Ted Willis. Genesian

to the promotion of a West Indian.
Jacko automatically assumes the liberal
stance. But when his daughter falls in
love with a West Indian he finds that his
wife is as bitterly prejudiced as the union-
ists.
All of his married life Jacko has been
too busy fighting for his principles to
notice his wife’s feelings. Now she rebels
and demands that Jacko stop thinking
about his principles and consider her
feelings.
At this point in the play the issues
seem to me to become thoroughly con-
fused. Both principle and feeling surely
ought to condemn racial hatred. In any
case the mother’s deep prejudice is not
jeally explained by her being a neglected
wife or a disappointed mother.
In the rush and muddle of everyday
life problems of human relationships
usually seem impossibly complicated.
But we look to literature to clarify the
issues. Ted Willis, intent on presenting a
slice of life, has merely reproduced the
muddle.
Evelyn Wood's production, like most
Australian productions of English or
American “slices of life”, is not con-
vincingly realistic. The actors adopt a
variety of accents and styles, not all of
which can be authentic Wapping. The
set has the requisite “slice-of-life” dreari-
ness, but is it typical Wapping dreariness?
When such a play lacks intellectual or
emotional force, photographic realism is
its only remaining virtue.
Jacko Palmer is the only interesting
character and James Quinn’s performance
is the most satisfactory. Jacko's wife is
a difficult part and Ina Drum's alterna-
tion between a block-like and an over-
wrought Nell does not seem convincing.

The Generals’ Feud
By EK DUM
The Gordon Bennett Story. Frank Legg.
Angus and Robertson. 455.
The two main themes of Frank Legg’s
biography of Lt-General Gordon Bennett
a splendid and aggressive fighting
officer are the General’s “sensational
escape” from Singapore and “the cul-
mination of what had by then become
a personal feud between Bennett, the
supreme civilian soldier of his day, and
Field-Marshal Blarney and the Staff
Corps officers of the Military Board”.
The latter theme is very inaccurately
stated. One could scarcely have rated
Bennett as the “supreme” civilian soldier
of the time, looking at the records of
others less advertised. And the feud was
not confined, on the opposition side, to
Field-Marshal Blarney (who wasn’t yet a
field-marshal) and staff officers. Some
of the senior citizen officers, even some
of those of the Eighth Division, were very
much at one with the High Command.
As for the escape, the issue is not as
Mr Legg states it. It was largely whether
General Bennett should have escaped
without the consent of the High Com-
mand, the surrender not yet having been
made.
To put the whole thing into perspec-
tive is no easy matter. All sorts of
considerations arise. For instance, should
a general, wishing to “fight another day”,
leave his troops to fall into the hands
of an enemy with no respect for p.o.ws.
under the command of a substitute who—
in his escaping superior’s own words —
was “weak from a recent attack of
malaria”, who. when he paid him his
last visit and told him he was off to
Australia, “seemed dazed”.
If he was escaping to instruct the home
authorities in jungle fighting, why did he
take with him a broadcasting executive,
who paved the way for his reception in
Australia by a broadcast from Java via
the BBC striving to create the right
atmosphere, and his aide-de-camp? Why
did he not take the pick of his fighting
officers who had been on the actual re-
ceiving end of the Japanese advance—
men like Galleghan who undoubtedy
would have been invaluable in the New
Guinea campaign and risen to high rank
instead of remaining to the war’s end
in Changi?
I merelv pose these questions. It is
hard enough to find facts and factors in
the matter, much less give judgment.
The British War History states that,
at a conference of commanders on Feb-
ruary 1 3, all agreed that a counterstroke
was impossible, but “Bennett and Heath
advocated capitulation”, and that Perci-
val decided nevertheless to fight on.
This was supported by Wavell’s orders
that there must be no limit to the fight-
ing. even to the point of house-to-house
combat. The Australian official version
in “The Japanese Thrust” slurs over the
incident and states that “General Ben-
nett now agreed with his fellow formation
commanders that there remained no
prospect of a successful counter-attack.”
Bennett in “Why Singapore Fell” as-
serts that the conference was held on the'
morning of February 13—it was held, as
both Australian and British histories
agree, at 2 p.m. He asserts that “all were
unanimous that a situation had arrived
when further resistance was hopeless . . .
It was decided to send a message to
Genera] Wavell urging him to agree to
an immediate capitulation”. This is un-
doubtedly inaccurate. Mr Legg adopts
Bennett's version almost verbatim, as he
does so often, although Bennett’s ver-
sions are apt to be confusing and his
criticisms often conflicting in important
points.
Apart from the escape, the other
highlight of the book is the theme of
the supposed life-long feud between
Bennett’s father and Blarney. The whole
thing is grossly exaggerated. And there is
little content in the legend that Bennett
was a serious rival to Blarney for the
Command of Other Land Forces in the
Commonwealth zone of operations.
If Bennett hoped to achieve any results
on Australian military methods he cer-
tainly went the wrong way about it in
going over the heads of the High Com-
mand and consorting with Cabinet mem-
bers, criticising his own officers and his
immediate superiors, and at the same
time resorting to publicity and Press
conferences. The technique was carried
to a point at which Blarney was forced
to assert his right to consultation by
Cabinet and direct access to the Prime
Minister in matters concerning appoint-
ments and the publicising of them. At no
time was his position of superiority in
doubt or his replacement by Bennett
likely. Bennett's feud x with him was
supposed to have developed out of the
wrath of Bennett’s father at being criti-
cised as a cadet commander by Blarney,
a young ex-teacher area officer. But
this is nonsense. And there was no real
“culmination” of it.
Blarney resented Bennett’s statement in
“Why .Singapore Fell” that, on the eve
of the Japanese landing, he had “pooh-
GORDON BENNETT
poohed the idea of that event and was
very definite that nothing would happen
in Malaya”. He was justly angry, for
he had thought no such thing—he told
me the day he left Sydney that he was
going back to the Middle East earlier
than expected because he felt that if he
delayed he might be cut off. He had
added that there was a blackout in
Manila already.
As for the feud, I remember visiting
Blarney with his civilian adviser, Harry
Alderman, late in 1944, just after
‘'Why Singapore Fell” came out. We
discussed the book. Blarney was equable
about it though he deprecated the escape
as ill-calculated. It was “typically Ben-
nett”, he said. “He has no grievance.
He went over the head of the Malayan
command to escape and criticised us,
which was subversive to discipline. Yet
we promoted him. We gave him a corps.
What has he to complain about?”
“Yes,” I said, “but his real grievance,
as a fighting soldier with jungle experi-
ence, was that you sent him to Western
Australia. The question he raises is:
Why did you send him to Perth?” Like
a flash, the General replied: “Because we
didn't own Madagascar. Any nearer, he
would have fought all of us. If we had
sent him to New Guinea, he would have
fought all our own side as well as the
Japanese. He would have fought
General MacArthur. He would have tried
to divide MacArthur and myself and the
Cabinet. So we sent him to an area
where there was real danger still.” (As
there was, in fact.)
In other words, Blarney appeared to
agree with General Percival, who, in his
report on operations letter to Blarney
after the war, reported that Bennett had
“voluntarily and without permission re-
linquished command of the AIF" on
February 15, 1942, the date of the capi-
tulation. This was later supported by
Brigadier Thyer’s report that “relations
had been strained between the British and

Australians because Bennett had proved
himself “incapable of subordinating him-
self to the Malaya command or of
co-operating wholeheartedly with other
commanders”. At the closed military
court inquiry, the finding agreed that
Bennett had left before the terms of sur-
render were- made known and imple-
mented and gave the opinion that he had
not “been justified in handing over his
command or in leaving Singapore”.
Mr Justice Ligertwood, who sat in an
open inquiry as Royal Commissioner,
found to the same effect, but added,
inter alia , that the escape was hazardous
and involved no reflection on Bennett’s
personal courage; that he did, in fact,
bring back valuable information which
was used in training the AIF in jungle
warfare, and that his decision to escape
was inspired by patriotism and by the
belief that he was acting in the best
interest of the country.
But this does not invalidate the con-
viction that to have employed Bennett
in Blarney’s place, or in any place in
which he might have found himself in
conflict with a superior American com-
mand, would have been a dangerous
experiment. Nor does it justify Mr
Legg’s claims that the conflict about him
was one of Citizen versus Staff Corps
soldiers, or that the Staff Corps was
afflicted with a Brisbane Line complex
which justified Bennett in his continual
criticisms of them. The Brisbane Line
plan was a wise precaution designed
only to meet the possible but improbable
eventuality of Japan invading Australia
before there were sufficient forces here
to deal with such an invasion, Blarney,
I am sure, never felt in the slightest
danger of being supplanted by him. He
never took any risks with those who
threatened his position in any aspect in
the slightest, whether they were staff men
or civilian soldiers. Witness the disaster
that haopened to Sidney Rowell, a much
abler officer of the type needed for all-
over command than Bennett, w 7 hen he
crossed swords with Blarney in New
Guinea. It was one of the greatest com-
pliments that could have been paid
Rowell. On the other hand, Blarney fully
acknowledged Bennett’s qualities as a
front-line soldier.

Girls in their Married Bliss. Edna O’Brien.
Cape. 23s.
No doubt there is something about the
Irish. This third Edna O'Brien novel has
so much dash, vigor, vulgar wit and
honest-to-God frankness that it reads al-
most like a treasury of all the traditional
Irish literary gifts. One can hear the
brogue, and even, in its few more serious
moments, detect the lilting rhythms and
easy melodies that are the glory of the
Irish theatre. The story moves between
pathos and comedy, wistful nostalgia and
riotous farce, and its progress is up and
down like a seesaw, not forward.
The story concerns two friends, Kate
and Baba, for whom marriage is anything
but bliss, and whose adventures outside
it provide the slender incidents of the
novel.
It's no wonder that Edna O'Brien’s
popularity is growing. Her novel has
the uninhibited candor that for
many readers made Mary McCarthy’s
“The Group” a succes scanclale. And its
ingredients, sex in various forms, and
even the four-letter word, must guarantee
one kind of success, especially for jaded
palates. Yet there is a bit more to it than
this. At times Edna O'Brien is outrage-
ously funny. She has a racy, incisive style,
and a trick of turning cliches inside out
and revitalising them. And she has a
devastating eye for absurd detail. Baba
is the excuse for the best comic scenes.
Edna O'Brien’s descriptions of the visit
of the drummer, and later of Baba's
desperate efforts to produce a miscarriage
by means of a hot bath and liberal doses
of castor oil, are extremely funny. Even
in the more subdued scenes of the novel
her style retains its freshness and life.
Her words are instantly revealing, and
though she gives the impression of en-
joying writing, she does not over-elabor-
ate, and the sharpness of individual
scenes is at least partly a result of econo-
my.
Yet with all this “Girls in their Married
Bliss” is not really a book to which one
would return. It seems to me that Edna
O'Brien hasn't really made up her mind
as to whether it’s a frolic with a touch
of pathos, or, as the title might
suggest, whether it offers a serious com-
ment upon woman's life and love. Both
Kate and Baba are lost. Kate lives in a
romantic daydream remote from the facts
of existence. She has a longing for love
and freedom w'hich is surely doomed to
be unfulfilled in this world, since securing
the one must involve renouncing the
other. Baba, in her more sophisticated
worldliness, seems to rebel against the
mere fact of womanhood, and one is in-
clined to take seriously her outburst, “Oh,
God, who does not exist, you hate
women, otherwise you'd have made them
different”.
Yet neither of these attitudes is stres-
sed, and indeed the novel ends with
Kate’s expression of naive optimism
about a rosy future cancelled by the hard
fact that she must begin another day’s

The Soapbox Ratbags
The Speakers. Heathcote Williams. Hut-
chinson. 38s. 6d.
What a much duller place _ the world
would be without its ratbags. They are
the salt of the earth. How refreshing it
is to listen to someone who has broken
the chains of that grim old tyrant, Com-
monsense, and escaped into the fairy-
land of Nonsense. Flat-earthers, Great
Pyramidists, sunflower seed munchers,
astral travellers, people who talk to little
green men from Venus, and the chap
who writes “Eternity” on the pavement.
Bless them all. May the bees in their
bonnets never grow less.
The most famous forum of delusion is,
of course, Hyde Park in London. Every
tourist must have bathed in that torrent
of oratory, while indecipherable banners
droop under the dusty elms, policemen
pad round the outskirts of the crowds
looking for perverts and pickpockets,
and the sound of buses in Park Lane
forms a deep ground-bass to the solo-
ists on their stepladders and boxes.
Sean O’Casey once wrote: “I have
often wondered where these speakers
came from, how they lived and where
they went when they had said or screamed
their say, and the gates of the park were
closing”. Heathcote Williams set out to
track four of the most extravagant Hyde
Park orators to their lairs after the last
listeners had drifted out of the darkening
park. The result is an immensely read-
able book, an excursion into a surrealist
world where fact and fantasy, logic and
lunacy, dance together in wild, bewild-
ering patterns.
“I am not a paranoiac. Everyone is
looking at me. Everyone is following
me,” says MacGuiness, the crazy Irish-
man with toothless jaws and golden ear-
rings. We follow MacGuiness to Brixton
Prison and to a lunatic asylum. We
listen to him as he sits on an Embank-
ment bench, swallowing tonic wine and
marijuana tablets and mumbling the hal-
lucinatory story of his life into a tape-
recorder. He used to be a brilliant
speaker for the IRA. He can still “beg
the milk out of a cup of tea” with his
blarney. But he knows he will die soon.

The Scottish Split
The Paradox of Scottish Culture. David
Daiches. Oxford University Press. 17s. 6d.
If poetry can be defined as the artistic
use of words, as Plato put it, then pity
the people who are forced to change
their everyday language through politi-
cal, social and economic pressures. Their
literature, if they cling to the old tradi-
tions, will fast become obsolete, and their
attempts to master the new, fashionable,
and alien forms of expression must have
only a qualified success for several gen-
erations at least. We have seen this hap-
pen in our own time in Eastern Europe,
where Russian has become a lingua franca
in the last twenty years, and in the parts
of Africa and of Asia, where English has
superseded native languages, some of
them ancient and far from primitive in
their expressive power. But perhaps the
classic instance of the process, and cer-
tainly one that can now be looked at in
perspective, is the Anglicisation of Scot-
tish life and letters that was going on
apace in the eighteenth century.
The problems faced at that time by
Scottish writers, and poets in particular,
have gradually come to be realised over
the last hundred years, as appreciations
of Allan Ramsay, Robert Ferguson and
Robert Burns have become more critical.
This little volume brings together all the
strands, and Daiches advances the theory
of the paradox the remarkable fact
that at the very time when Scottish poets
were perfecting their use of their own
vernacular Scots tongue in a framework
of traditional Scots metre and verse
forms, they were faced by the desire to
emulate English language and verse forms
then prevalent among the literate and in-
fluential classes. This, Daiches thinks, led
to a “split”, a duality, in the consciousness
of the poets, often with a disastrous result
on their work, and often enough, with bad
psychological effect on the personality
of the poets themselves.
Reviewing the work of Burns, for ex-
ample, Daiches writes of the tensions that
existed between “Scotia's Bard” and the
Edinburgh literary elite of the time, who
applauded Burns as a “heaven-taught
ploughman” and “man of feeling” dis-
covered by themselves, but refused to
recognise him for what he truly was
the heir to a tradition stretching back to
the “makars” of the fifteenth century and
a carefully self-educated genius in his
own right. Certainly the influence of the
Edinburgh “literati” was never able to
debase Burns’ talent, or to make him
produce such stylised banality as the effu-
sion of one Scottish poet on “Fair Mel-
inda”:
Now all thy virgin-sweets are mine,
And all the shining charms that
grace thee;
My fair Melinda, come recline
Upon my breast, while 1 embrace
thee,
And tell, without dissembling art,
My happy raptures on thy bosom:
Thus will I plant within thy heart,
A love that shall for ever blossom.
but it did incline him into essays in stilted
Augustan style, where he was forced to
use the conventional “poetic” language
of Pope, Sheldon and Blacklock. The
fact, clearly brought out by . Daiches, is
that the most important section of Burns’
admiring audience, socially and in a liter-
ary sense, admired his rather insipid
“Anglicised” work, and deprecated his
masterly work in Scots dialect. The trag-
edy is that Burns was all too conscious of
this, and must have hated himself for
his own truckling to the demands of an
alien culture. When one considers the
measured, stilted exercise above, and
compares it as an expression of exulting
love with:
I hae been blythe wi’ comrades dear;
l hae been merry drinking;
I hae been joyfu’ gath’rin gear;
1 hae been happy thinking:
But a’ the pleasures e’er 1 saw,

the work of the poet working naturally
in his own idom. Burns probably summed
it up best when he replied to a critic
who praised the anglicising tendency:
“Sir, there are some spinsters in this my
country, who spin their thread so fine
that it is neither fit for weft nor woof.”
Here the poet’s instinct was true, and the
paradox lay in the rejection by his cul-
tured patrons of the man’s best work.
This is the theme that Daiches develops,
provocatively and trenchantly, in this
study of a national literature under alien
pressures. The setting of the issue against
its contemporary social and political
background is most ably done.

Burning the Laboratory
For months I have been planning it.
The time has come, nothing having
changed.
Almost like clockwork, the watchman,
shortly
After midnight, begins to doze, his head
bobbing
On his shoulders like a swimmer.
Occasionally a twitch will wake him,
hair
Falling into his eyes—but I must chance
that.
About one-thirty, Dr. Wunsch, always
last,
Will leave, followed by his hunched back
And unfinished thoughts. He ignores the
watchman
Who, in his sleep, expects him, dreaming
The truth. I will smack the watchman’s
head
With a pipe (hopefully not injuring him),
Take his keys and, guided by the floor
plan
(Sent to me by the State as a public
service),
I will, in less than four minutes, achieve
The basement where I will set three time-
bombs
I have myself made: one by the heating
plant;
One by the electrical control unit;
And one just for good luck. I will leave
By the delivery entrance in the back.
If all goes well, the building should not
Collapse, but fires should break out all
over,
Though, of course, I cannot know how
The various chemicals and equipment
Will react. Perhaps,. on the second floor,
The fixed brains of the white rats will
jerk open.
Prescribed memories and the tinkered
past
Will fall away; perhaps a saving word
Will shape the split, groping lips of a
leader.
It is possible. Like peace.

Burmese Pictures
Why Buddha Smiles. Jorcen Bisch. Collins.
38s. 6d.
This is a lively but superficial account
of the Danish author’s travels through
Burma and Cambodia (particularly of
the Burmese people): their smiling charm,
their serene, civilised attitude of mind,
their dislike of business affairs or politics.
He describes one native performance of a
long play in a primitive theatre, life in a
floating village through which he passes
during a journey in a small boat with
Uncle Maung Chit down the River Pilu,
with a mixed cargo for the floating mar-
ket. The women do the hand-weaving,
but in one village the men workers in a
mechanised loom factory could jump out
of the windows into the canal below
when they wanted to cool off, swim
round to the entrance steps, and continue
the job. Small children wear a permanent
belt of empty calabashes, about the size
of small footballs, to keep them afloat
when they dive or fall into the water
from the balconies of the house.
Bisch’s main object seems to have been
to photograph and film the elusive
“giraffe women”; his search led him to
become a Buddhist monk for a short
time; a “lightning course in Buddhism,”
he says. With the help of a benign abbot,
he photographed these strangely elegant
women in a remote village. Neck-stretch-
ing begins for little girls when they are
five, and continues for years untd the
necks are about ten inches long, kept up-
right by heavy coils of steel wire to their
chins. The high spiral collars certainly
give the women a haughty look, but they
would die of suffocation if the spirals
were removed, for the neck muscles
would not hold up their heads, and the
custom is dying out.
The account of Buddhism is element-
ary and superficial, not touching the sub-
ject in depth. It seems that in Burma
anyone can become a monk, stay in a
Buddhist monastery for a while, wear the
saffron robe, eat and live simply, and
then return to the world. This the author
did and was allowed to work at his book
and journalism during his retreat. He
made friends with Bat Ears, a most pre-
cocious Shan boy of 14, who was enter-
ing a monastery for a second time “to
revise his understanding of true Bud-
dhism”. Light-heartedly, he knew all the
answers.
The superb colored photographs ar.e
the book’s main contribution, showing
aspects of life in a country of which we
in Australia know all too little; they make
up for the lack of mental sustenance.
One could have wished for more pictures
of the vast temples and sculptures of
Angkor Wat, the splendid art of the
Khmer people of 1000 years ago only
rescued from the grasping jungle within
the last 100 years, a fact which we in
Australia would do well to remember.
The present dangers in South-East Asia
are not mentioned, and the impression is
one of smooth reportage, full of pleasant
gaiety.

The Kelly Legend
Ned Kelly. Twenty-seven paintings by Sid-

Thames and Hudson. 465.
Nolan’s Kelly paintings should be more
widely known. Fortunately, the series is
still together in Melbourne’s Museum of
Modern Art and Design, though not
usually on display, and this Thames and
Hudson collection should help to spread
knowledge of them a bit more.
I still, perhaps perversely, think of
these paintings mainly as landscapes with
figures, and not as dramatic narrative.
Admittedly one's first impression of the
series in a gallery is of the curious
slotted helmet and the upended figures
of wounded constables and horses; but
the most enduring pleasure of the series
comes not from its figures (apart from
the black helmet) but from the accur-

acy and beauty of the landscape paint-
ing.
Perhaps this is just bad memory. In
this book, where the reproductions are
scaled down to one seventh of the origi-
nal, or even further, the foreground hogs
the attention. Most of the subtlety lost
in color reproduction is lost from the
landscape.
If Nolan has any right to the common
claim that he created a myth, it would
rest on his wedding of figure to land-
scape. He represents Australia as harsh
but beautiful. He prefers to show it as
a hot and lonely country, prone to
natural disasters. The figures he has
placed in it are tragic ones, like Kelly
himself or Burke and Wills. He has not
however stressed violence or brutality.
He has found beauty in the tragedy by
identifying his figures with the loneliness
of the landscape and by endowing them
with more nobility than historically they
deserve.
Kelly is certainly in this series an
inflated figure (which the editor, Robert
Melville, does not attempt to puncture).
But does this inflation elevate the narra-
tive to the dignity of a legend? The cul-
tivated naivete of the style and the un-
forgettable armor plated symbol certainly
mark the series out as the best attempt in
our art to create a bright and heroic
past. Robert Melville surmises in his
Introduction that the Kelly device “might
yet be chalked on the walls of all the
cities of the world as a sign of Freedom”.
A worthy hope, but before it is realised
the painting will need to be better known
to the kind of people likely to chalk
revolutionary devices on walls..

Child and Field
On the crest of the green field
The child swam, dipping
With the wind in tether,
Child, field, and wind together.
They in their perilous journey
On an ocean between fences,
Field with child swimming,
Worldlessly homing to the calling
Of the voice, to the latch and the grey
Doves cooing all day
On the roof with the weather,
Bowing and calling, flying together
In pale light and sun,
In the day's flush and run,
Destined as one to nest
And love in rest and unrest:
While the child pressed its face
To the pane for the tongue's taste
Of the tasteless glass, to watch
For the green dipping and the long touch
Of the wind on the field’s crest.

It Hardly Wets the Sides
A further recognition by the Re-
serve Bank of rising liquidity
pressures prompted a release
of £244-m. from Statutory Reserve
Deposits on May 5, just one month
after a similar release in April. That
makes about £49m. put back into
trading bank circulation so far this
year, compared with call-ups in 1964
totalling £l2 lm.
The two releases in four weeks only
slightly exceed the £46m. raised in
the last Commonwealth Loan, and it
seems quite evident that this extra
splash of liquidity will be blotted up
quickly by existing demands. Tax pay-
ments are requiring large blobs of
money. Anyone who is forced to sell
equities on the stock market to cover
tax commitments is obtaining much
lower prices than available last year.
Bank overdrafts went up by
£10.5m. to £1950.5m. in April, with
the average new lending at £11.6m.

Liquidity must tighten still further
as the tax season progresses. Increased
demands for credit could force the
public back on to the hire-purchase
and finance groups, but these in turn
are obliged to compete on the open
market for loan money at currently
high interest rates.
It is apparent that the Treasury,
after paying such high rates of interest
in the last Commonwealth Loan, is
anxious to see interest rates stabilise,
particularly in view of the big con-
version loans falling due in the next
seven months.
Budgeting figures in the Treasury
also must have received some buffet-
ing when the increased tempo of Aus-
tralia’s defence commitments were
announced. There are many who are
convinced that tax increases in the
next Federal Budget are a foregone
conclusion.
A further reminder that conditions
could become a little tighter was Sir
Roland Wilson’s voice echoing back
from the Chase Manhattan seminar in
New York, where he mentioned that
a few little headaches were coming up
this year. Just a few of those items
likely to prompt the hand to reach
for the aspirin bottle are overseas
capital restraints, rising imports,
depressed export prices, increased
defence costs and sinking fund obliga-
tions on overseas’ loans costing
£24.7m. a year.

conservative, so perhaps Australia

Prop for Sterling
|>ad news travels fast, but not too
much attention was paid to the
support given by the six Common
Market countries last week to Britain’s
application for 1400 m. dollars credits
with the IMF. These funds are needed
to refinance some of the 2000 m. dol-
lars of emergency Central Bank
credits expiring at the end of May.
Certainly, M. d'Estaing of France
put his thumb in the wine when he
pointed out to Pressmen that if Britain
did not meet her balance-of-payments
target figures within a specified time-
table, new measures would be used by
the British Government. Perhaps he
meant import or capital restraints; or
possibly devaluation.
Nonetheless, the promise of IMF
credits for Britain helped to sustain

Britain’s gold and convertible currency
reserves rose during April by a frail

to £stgB4om.
The general undertone from the
Common Market talks, however, was
that France was gaining ground in her
insistence on revising the world
monetary and payments system, with
further emphasis on gold.
The Americans appear to be adopt-
ing the line that a change in the inter-
national monetary system is due, but
they are against accepting the French
composite reserve unit (CRU) as a
basis for negotiations. Politics, pres-
tige, national pride and all those things
enter into such matters, and one
attitude is that you could hardly ex-
pect a red-blooded American boy to
accept the Froggies’ goddam CRU,
which doesn’t even grow in Texas.
Judging Growth Yields
A study of growth yields by the
Sydney sharebroking firm of
Ralph W. King and Yuill suggests that
Australian investors are now looking
more closely at a company’s present
and future ability to pay dividends.
Certainly, investors are being forced
to pay attention to equity yields in
the current climate of rising interest
rates and money shortages.
The study of growth yields helps
to point out a few fallacies, the most
obvious of which is that a stock with
a low yield automatically must be
classed as a growth stock (otherwise
buyers wouldn’t accept such a low
yield). Past performance often sets
the standard for putting certain stocks
in the low yield class, but this does
not mean that the low yield is justi-
fiable. Thus prices of some stocks
move out of line with their intrinsic
worth.
King and Yuill provides some in-
teresting points on growth, one of
which is that substantial capital gains

occurred in 1959 and 1960 but have
subsequently been much less. Despite
bonus issues and new share issues,
shareholders gained relatively little in
dividend income. Analysis of 60 lead-
ing stocks over a 13-year period,
after eliminating stocks whose divi-
dends had not grown, showed that the
average rate of dividend increase was
slightly less than 7 p.c. a year com-
pounded.
The average is high, because some
stocks only held their dividend growth
or lost ground. This is not a very
hopeful start, although some com-
panies, of course, fared much better
than the average.
A table of average annual dividend
growth from 1955 to 1964 shows a
percentage growth of 14.4 for Brick-
works, 12.9 for Brambles and 12.8
for Electrical Equipment. King and
Yuill’s arbitrary assessment of annual
growth rate of dividends for the next
10 years suggests 9 p.c. for Brick-
works, 6 p.c. for Brambles but 10 p.c.
for Electrical Equipment.
It seems that past capital growth
should be assessed carefully when
calculating future dividend growth,
because it has been proved in the past
that companies which enjoyed a rapid
capital expansion often were forced
to reduce their dividends, or at least
show no growth in dividends.
Perhaps the moral remains that
success depends on picking the right
stock at the right period of its growth
cycle. Too often the dazzling per-
formance of growth over a specific
period entices investors to buy such
a stock for a repetition of that per-
formance. On some of the figures
presented in the analysis, there are
many pitfalls in this thinking.

That’s what Lloyds Bank has done for

April to ship a complete knitting plant

It is believed to be the largest single

ECONOMICS ANONYMOUS
Long Term Labor Availability
New guide lines for industrial planners
on the rapid “sell-out” in Mel-
bourne of the Treasury’s “Projec-
tions of the Work-force 1963-1976”,
industrial companies have welcomed it
with open arms. Indeed they should,
because this is one of the most useful
publications to come out of Canberra
for a long time. Although it is published
by the Treasury, whose statisticians must
be congratulated, it is believed that,
before the figures were fed to the com-
puters there, leading demographers like
Professor W. D. Borrie of the ANU had
a considerable fist in their estimation.
Presumably the Department of Labor
and National Service did, too, and it is
a bit surprising to find the publication
coming from the Treasury and not from
them,
It will be understood, of course, that,
as the publication is at considerable pains
to emphasise, these are projections of
the work-force and not forecasts of what
it will be. There is a vital difference. A
forecast is a prediction that something
will happen. It judges that a, b, c . . .
will occur and that therefore x will result.
It is an empirical statement about what
the future will hold.
A projection is something quite dif-
ferent. It is a formal proposition which
states that, given certain assumptions, a
certain result will follow. It says that if
a, b, c . . . occur then x results. Pro-
jections are but exercises in deduction.
As the publication says, “they may throw
a beam of light into the future but can
never illuminate it wholly”.
Obviously, then, the value of these
predictions in the hands of industrial
planners will depend uniquely on the
degree of validity of the assumptions on
which they are based. This applies
equally to both steps in the process, pro-
jecting the total population and pro-
jecting the work-force participation rates
of total population; that is, the pro-
portion of given segments of the popula-
tion which are in the work-force.
It is not possible here to go into the
complex gamut of assumptions used in
these projections but, apart from saying
that on close examination they seem to
me to be realistic enough to warrant high
confidence in them, they are framed
broadly on three planes. One is assuming
no migration, the second is assuming net
migration rates of 70,000 a year, and
the third net migration of 100,000 a year
(the latter being pretty close to the net
rate of migration achieved in the
calendar year 1964).
It is admitted that the first and fore-
most of the uncertainties is the future
course of net migration, both as to its
total and its sex-age distribution “we
simply have no way of knowing within
a reasonable range of error what net
migration will be in the years to 1976”.
The other main uncertainties concern
the work-force participation rates of the
student age-group, of married women
and of people of pensionable age.
Basic to the Treasury’s whole exercise,
of course, is the Commonwealth Statis-
tician’s own projections of the popula-
tion, which were published in February
covering the years 1966 to 1986 and
which, in turn, were calculated on three
planes, the same ones used in the work-
force projection (that is, assuming no
net migration, 70,000 a year net migra-
tion and 100,000 a year net migration).
W. D. BORRIE
These are worth reciting in their own
right, but space only permits to give
the figures based on the further assump-
tion that fertility rates will remain at
those of the average of the 1957-61 rates.
With no immigration the population on
these projections will rise to 12,937,000
in 1976, with 70,000 a year net migra-
tion to 14,051,000 and with 100,000 a
year net migration to 14,533,000; that
is, about 3,000,000 more than at present.
Neglecting the possibility that we will
have no net migration in the years to
1976, we can concentrate on the likely
size of the work-force component of the
population given the two assumptions of
70,000 and 100,000 a year for net migra-
tion up to that year. With 70,000 net
migration, the projections see the work-
force increasing from 4,368,400 to
5,745,000 in 1976 with figures for inter-
mediate years, 4,693,200 in 1966 and
5,211,500 in 1971. Given 100,000 a
year net migration, the projections see
the work-force rising to 5,953,500 in
1976 and in the intervening years to
4,753,300 in 1966 and 5,332,500 in
1971.
The striking feature of these move-
ments (taking the case of 100,000 a year
net migration) is that, although the
average percentage rates of growth per
annum in the population and the work-
force are projected to be almost identical,
that is 2.39 p.c. for population and 2.38
p.c. for work-force, it is projected that
while there will be a strong rise in the
rate of population growth per year from
the beginning of the period to 1976, the
percentage annual rise in the work-force
will decrease quite sharply. That is,
population growth between 1963-66 will
be at the annual rate of 2.31 p.c., while
it will rise to 2.44 p.c. in 1971-76; in
its turn the projected annual rise in the
work-force will fall from 2.58 p.c. in
1963-66 to only 2.23 p.c. in 1971-76.
One of the inferences to be drawn
from this would be that the work force
will be called upon to support an in-
creasingly bigger proportion of the
population over the years to 1976 be-
cause, although the work-force will be
growing strongly (even if at a diminished
rate), the numbers of the non-work-force
in the population will be rising pro-
portionately more than it.
Equally significant, the projections
show striking differences in the move-
ment of the work-force as between its
male and female components. The rate
of increase in the projected male work-
force will slip gradually further behind
that in the projected male population
during the period. By contrast, the
female work-force is projected to in-
crease at a very much faster rate than
the population in 1963-66, even if there-
after the two rates of increase come
much closer together. In any case,
throughout the period the female work-
force is projected to rise at a consider-
ably faster rate than the increase in the
female population itself. This would
indicate that we concentrate our atten-
tion more than at present on creating
work opportunities for females. These
comparisons are all assuming a 100,000
rise in net migration a year, but they are
also valid for the assumption of a 70,000
a year increment to net migration.
The changing relative importance of
the various groups distinguished within


the work-force over the period 1963-76
has its own significance, social as well
as economic. There is a tendency, after
1966, for the proportion of teenagers in
the work-force to fall off. The tendency
is in fact only delayed until 1966 as a
result of the rapid increase in the teen-
age population between 1963 and 1966
(a consequence of the post-war “baby
boom”), which offsets the reduction be-
tween those years in work-force par-
ticipation rates of this group. But after
1966 the proportion of teenagers in the
work-force falls away sharply. Thus,
whereas in 1961 13.2 p.c. of the work-
force were aged under 20, in 1976 this
group comprises only 11.0 p.c. of the
projected work-force (assuming 100,000
net migration).
The rate of increase of married
females in the work-force during 1963-76
(4.84 p.c. per annum with net migration
of 100,000 per annum), although lower
than the rate of increase in the period
1954-61 (6.66 p.c. per annum), is much
more important quantitatively than in
the earlier period because of the in-
creased weighting that this group has
now achieved in the work-force. In 1954
there were only 258,000 married females
in the work-force, equivalent to about 7
p.c. of the total work-force. By 1961
there were 406,000 married females in
the work-force, equivalent to 9.6 p.c. of
the total. By 1966, according to the pro-
jection (assuming 100,000 net migration
per annum), this percentage would reach
10.9 p.c.; by 1971, 12.2 p.c.; and by
1976, 13.4 p.c.
This projected rate of increase appears
to be rapid, but it should be noted that
in other high income countries married
females already constitute as great or a
greater proportion of the work-force
than is projected for Australia in 1976.
For example, in the United States
married females constituted 19.6 p.c. of
the work-force in 1963; in Canada they
constituted 13.5 p.c. in 1962; in Sweden
they constituted 13.1 p.c. of the work-
force in 1960; and in the United King-
dom they constituted 18.0 p.c. in 1964.
Others to increase their role in the
work-force significantly are males and
unmarried females aged 20-24. These
groups show a more rapid rate of growth
over the period of the projection than
do any other groups except married
females. However, the relatively rapid
rate of increase occurs only in the
periods and 1966-71; in 1971-
76 the rate of increase is less than for
the total male and unmarried female
work-forces respectively. These rapidly
changing trends reflect the asymmetry
in the population resulting from the post-
war “baby boom”, and the delayed entry
into the work-force of teenagers in par-
ticular because more of them are pro-
longing their period of education.
By contrast with the projections for
married females and the age group
20-24, the “hard core” of the work-force,
namely males aged 25-59, is projected
at a rate of increase well below the
average for the whole work-force. This
continues the trend in 1954-61, when
their rate of increase equalled 1.48 p.c.
annually compared with a rate of in-
crease for the whole work-force of 1.91
p.c. However, the projected rate of 1.98
p.c. per annum (with net migration of
100,000 per annum) for this group
during 1963-76 is well above the 1954-61
level and is, in fact, a little closer to the
overall rate of increase than was the
case in 1954-61.
For those who will be using these pro-
jections for future industrial planning,
the Treasury has a word of comfort
about the assumptions which are clearly
crucial to their usefulness. It says that,
although the assumptions are arbitrary
and net immigration in particular is very
difficult to predict both as to numbers
and composition, nonetheless any other
assumptions would run quite as much
risk of being proved unrealistic. “As it
is, however, the assumptions made have
the advantage that they can be readily
varied and the work-force estimates
based on them re-calculated.” Its final
warning is that although every effort has
been exerted to make the assumptions
as realistic as possible, it should not be
thought that the results are thereby in-
vested with anything like “mathematical
certainty”.
CROESUS
Mr McMahon’s Mastery
Can governments control unemployment?
perennial question whether the
economy is going up, down or side-
ways is, for the moment, answered by
the ANZ Bank rather differently from
most economists. Choosing between what
it calls “an uncomfortable inflationary
spiral”, “some degree of recession” and
“steering between these extremes for a
further significant period” it opts for the
last of these three, but admits to having
its tongue in its cheek or at any rate
its fineers crossed.
This column also prefers to sit on the
fence in measuring the immediate
economic prospect, erring, if anything,
on the cautionary side. It could amount
to a question of how long the sideways
movement will last. Like the ANZ we
think the steadier appearance of con-
sumer prices is encouraging for the near
future, but six months ahead is about as
far as one would go on that tack.
With the portents for a trickier situa-
tion emerging later in the year, one
listened with some attention to Mr W.
McMahon, the Minister for Labor, dilate
at some length to the International Con-
gress on Human Relations in Melbourne
last week on the skill with which the
Government deals with the problems of
full employment. “We have found the
answer,” he said without a blush.
One went away not so much ponder-
ing over the Government’s failure to
maintain full employment in 1961 and
1962 and the hard battle to restore it
by 1964, but rather more about whether,
as Mr McMahon believes, it can meet
any forthcoming test for full employ-
ment. In the Minister for Labor’s view
the secret, it seems, is simply to keep
effective demand at the necessary level.
If this is done, he says, not only can full
employment be maintained but any dis- v
placement of labor caused by tech-
nological change and automation can be
looked after, too.
The inference is not only that the
Government is in command of effective
demand but also that the Arbitration
Commission, the balance of payments
and capital inflow can all be counted on
to play the same tune as the pipers in
Canberra.
Frankly one must doubt strongly that
the Government is in command of
effective demand any more than it is of
the stream of goods and services flowing
into the pipelines to meet it or of the
level of investment and savings required
to support the flow. Is Mr McMahon
suggesting that, in the event of a serious
fall in our overseas resources arising
from reductions in export income and
capital inflow on the one hand or in-
creased imports to sustain full emplov-
ment on the other, the Government can
maintain effective demand at a level
consonant with full employment as if
nothing has happened to the balance of
payments and overseas reserves? If so,
I find it hard to swallow,
It would be no more sensible to suggest
that the Government can remain in-
different to the public’s current disinvest-
ment in savings bank deposits. The
actual drop in savings bank deposits in
March is one of the most disquieting
factors in the current situation, not only
because it most probably indicates a fall
in the propensity to save and so means
an increase in consumption pressures,
but also because it weakens one of the
main props of Government loans and
housing finance. Its strong inflationary
implications cannot be shrugged off as
if the economic balance was still being
supported by the massive flow of money

into the savings banks in the last three
years (we first drew attention to the
disturbing trend in savings bank deposits
three months ago).
The AJNZ Bank doesn’t mention the
savings trend in its latest assessment of
the economic prospects, but leads off
with similar thinking to the Minister for
Labor’s. In its view, also, “the pro-
longation of economic buoyancy is not
beyond powers of modern managers of
our economic systems”, and it supports
this by citing the success the US Gov-
ernment has had in confounding the
economic analysts by keeping a boom
going for more than four years.
The Bank is right, of course, in saying
that the Federal Government has very
wide powers for influencing the level of
economic activity. It instances the direct
influence of the Government’s own
spending, borrowing and taxing opera-
tions and its control over the banking
system. It even goes so far as saying
that, admittedly “to a lesser extent”, the
Government can influence the non-bank-
ing sectors of finance and industry,
neglecting perhaps the long-standing
complaint of the banks that its influence
is much less than adequate. The upshot,
in the Bank’s view, is that “among the
various conflicting factors today, the
authorities may be able to exert suf-
ficient influence to keep the economy at
a high level of activity with virtually all
resources fully employed but without
generating dangerous inflationary or
speculative features”.
Flowever, for all the strangeness of
this declaration of faith in the powers
that be and the effectiveness of official
economic policy, the ANZ does admit to
a few doubts. These are mainly con-
cerned with the prospective level of
defence expenditure, the balance of pay-
ments and the likely level of capital
inflow yet as if these also could be
well accommodated by official policy.
All in all the Bank thinks that, in the
terms of the optimists, we will go bump-
ing along the top at least until the
Budget.
Among other things the ANZ believes
the relative stability of consumer prices
is encouraging, saying that “in view of
the high level of activity, especially high
employment, the relative stability of
prices is further ground for believing that
current prosperity can be maintained
without generating serious inflation”. It
says this after admitting earlier in its
April issue of business indicators that its
factory production index (which one is
pleased to note is to continue and on a
more streamlined basis, despite the ap-
pearance of the Commohwealth Statis-
tician’s new factory production index)
shows a fall (seasonally corrected) of 1.4
p.c. from January to March, “suggesting
uncertainty in the Australian economy
at the present time”. The latter is some-
thing, however, that presumably the
Bank as well as Mr McMahon thinks
can well be taken care of by the Gov-
ernment without any threat to full em-
ployment or prices.
For a less slavish approach to the
economic prospects one turns to the -
latest summing up of the economic
prospects in the “Economic Review”,
where an article by Professor R. C.
Gates and Dr K. M. Kolsen goes to
rather painful lengths to paint a picture
of the economy as demanding severe
anti-inflationary treatment from the
authorities. There is no suggestion of
omnipotency in the Government’s powers
to deal with an inflammable situation,
seen by the authors in which “it is the
possibility of an accelerating rise in
prices and money incomes that provides
the major ground for immediate concern

The Suburbs in Flower
Nurserymen share in the bloom
An Australian gardening revolution is
taking place, giving nurserymen
and plant retailers their best business
for years. Assisted by a high level of
home building and a greater garden
consciousness among Australians, the
people who supply plants, and grow
them, say that in some cases supply
cannot meet demand for quality plants.
It would appear that we’re following
other countries’ examples and concen-
trating on indoor decoration with plants
and generally brightening up gardens.
There’s an element of “keeping-up-with-
the-Joneses” to be taken into account
also and a swing back to gardening for
relaxation. Now that gardening has been
made easy with prepared seedlings, weed-
killers, power mowers and so on, the
feeling in the industry is that sales will
continue to grow.
Today the Australian is well served for
all his gardening requirements. Generally
speaking he can buy all his needs from
one place. The Press has no doubt
helped the revolution by paying more
attention to the home gardener—with
articles on how to grow, how to prune,
when to plant, what to plant and how
to lay out a garden.
The actual plants, seeds and equip-
ment suppliers have helped
a great deal by more attractive merchan-
dising, better quality plants, unlimited
advice and encouragement and better
service. They have promoted gardening
to the point where it appeals “to any-
body from eight to 80”, one nursery-
man said.
The gardener, in turn, is also respon-
sible, for he wants better quality
materials, sound advice and equipment.
The garden supply field is, broadly
speaking, divided into two groups the
producer and the retailer non-producer.
These can be further divided into those
who supply shrubs and trees, those who
supply flowers and shrubs, succulents,
indoor plants, sundries and so on. The
writer gained the impression that the
division of the two basic groups is not
so much a question of appealing to a
sector of the market as the economies of
operation, particularly on the producer
side.
One nursery which concentrates only
on shrubs and trees said that to cover
all fields of supply (which would mean
producing flowers and vegetables) would
require as much land and capital again
as is already sunk into the shrub and
tree venture. And with land at present-
day prices the possibility of an adequate
return on the capital is completely out
of the question.
The bigger Sydney nurseries operate
on the outskirts of the metropolitan area.
Some of their land has been rezoned
and one nursery said a five-acre block
of land it had purchased 20 years ago
for £lBOO would be worth £lB,OOO an
acre if rezoned. “When this happens,”
the manager said, “we’re going to have
to move out and look elsewhere. Even
if we go further out we still have to pay
fantastic prices. I think we will have to
cease our nursery operations when the
land is rezoned,” he added.
The manager of Nock and Kirby Ltd’s
nursery at Epping, one of Sydneys
northern suburbs, said business at present
was bright. “We’re just coming into the
first of the two really busy seasons of
the year when people do most of the
actual planting work in their gardens.
Summer and winter are generally slow
as far as our sales are concerned.
“If anything, the lack of rainfall in
Sydney has made people more garden
conscious and they’ve realised the need
to protect what they have and add to
it. Water has not been particularly
scarce, though the picture could have
been slightly different if there had been
heavy water restrictions.
“Sydney people are becoming more
active gardeners. While they’re polish-
ing up the inside of their home they’re
also improving the outside. You can
have a pretty good average-sized garden
for about £lOO to £2OO, so it’s no wonder
business is good.”
A spokesman for Swane Bros Pty Ltd,
nurserymen of Ermington, Sydney, said
there was an increase in popularity of
plants in containers due to the increase
in flat and home unit dwellers. “People
are becoming more aware of these types
of decoration for their dwellings,” this
spokesman said. “Modern building
designs are enhanced by the use of
flowers. Although architects are not
specifying plants, they are sometimes
being used to great advantage.”
Commenting on the cost of land, the
spokesman said many nurseries in the
metropolitan area had been forced to
move out because, following rezoning,
costs and rates had risen. “We have
five acres at Ermington and 30 acres at
Dural (about 25 miles north of Sydney),
but it looks like we will have to move
from Ermington when the land is re-
zoned. We hope to be able to carry out
all our operations from Dural.”
The spokesman said the quality of
plants had improved greatly over the last
few years. “We can’t afford to run the
risk of failure of our products because
it gives us a bad name.” (One nursery,
not Swanes, said it lost about 20 p.c. of
its plants a year due to disease and
failure.) “We have to use high quality
sterilised soil and rear the seedlings
under carefully-controlled conditions. By
doing this we minimise our losses and
are able to sell a healthy plant which
should grow' almost anywhere. By buying
a plant disease-free, healthy and at a
good stage of development the gardener
generally has very little trouble. If the
nursery can offer high quality plants it

A large Sydney suburban nursery said
the ideal way to run a nursery was to
have one employee for every £lO,OOO of
capital employed. “This means a large
degree of mechanisation, which, un-
fortunately, very few of us are able to
afford at present. Most nurseries, I would
.say, have one employee for every £3OOO
to £5OOO invested in the business. But
I think we are tending toward the over-
seas system of garden centres and almost
automated nurseries. There will be an
increasing number of these in years to
come. Perhaps one day in Australia
v/e’ll see public investment in nurseries,
such as they have in America, but I think
it’s a fair way off at the moment. I
think the ultimate aim of the gardening
game in Australia should be for separate
producer and sales outlets. If we can
get this we can reduce costs by not only
cutting out middlemen but transport and
other overheads.”
A major problem facing some nurseries
is the lack of trained staff. In Sydney a
technical college course for horticultur-
ists is offered, though many nurserymen
The Bulletin spoke to felt that such
a course should be supplemented by one
on nursery management. “While a man
may have all the knowledge in the world
about growing plants, their diseases, their
treatment and maintenance, he may not
be a great business brain. A nursery
nowadays is a business, not a pastime.
Unfortunately there are not many starters
at present for a nursery management
course, yet I’m sure if the number rose
to around the 50 mark then some sort
of management course could be started.”
Possibly the largest organisation on
the purely retail side of gardening is
Woolworths. In nearly all of its stores
it has a gardening section selling every-
thing from packet seeds to shrubs and
sundries. The group also runs specialty
“My Greenhouse” stores in Sydney,
Newcastle and Brisbane and has plans
to open five more, most of them by the
end of this year.
A spokesman for Woolworths said the
garden sections in the company’s stores,
apart from being of general interest to
the public, were also a great drawcard
for the store. “However, our supplies
of quality lines are still well behind
demand.” Woolworths buys plants from
any nursery, while its packet seed lines
are prepared by a Sydney seedsman. It
is currently promoting gardening very
strongly in Victoria, but apparently has
no present plans to extend into the
specialty “My Greenhouse” operation
there. The group rates as leader in the
gardening field the Australian Capital
Territory, followed by Victoria. NSW
and Queensland are on an equal footing
as far as interest in gardens is concerned
and come after Victoria.
The spokesman said that while the
drought in NSW had not affected metro-
politan area sales “it has taken its
toll in the country. As long as there is
unrestricted water for gardens there is
no reason for our sales to slip. In those
country areas where there is very little
water our sales are affected”.
The spokesman said one of the reasons
for the present popularity of indoor
plants (a good selling line at Wool-
worths’ Greenhouses) was the influx of
plants and ideas from overseas. How-
ever, the market for indoor plants
“might not grow as quickly as it has
over the past years”.
The overall feeling in the plant indus-
try is that there are bigger things to
come. When and how long they will
take is, at present, an unanswerable ques-
tion. But give an Australian some land
and some water and he’ll always have a
garden.

Dangers of Dieselisation
The argument for policy revision
By NEIL GUNTHER
Progressive substitution of diesel-
A electric for steam motive power on
the NSW Railways has now gone far
enough to permit a critical examination
of the dieselisation policy in the light of
experience both here and abroad. All
the evidence (and this also applies to
other Australian systems, with some
reservations regarding Commonwealth
Railways in view of coal and water
difficulties) supports only one conclusion
—that the wholesale switch to diesels
is a costly blunder which should be
rectified without delay.
It must be explained at once that there
is no justification for any belief that
diesels are modern and therefore desir-
able, and that steam locomotives are old-
fashioned and fit only to be cast aside.
Steam locomotive development had
reached exciting heights in Britain ten
years ago, and in Austria in the last few
years Dr Giesl has perfected an exhaust
ejector which opens an even more bril-
liant future for steam.
The first exhaustive engineering review
of rail dieselisation was given late m
1960 by a leading US railroad engineer,
H. F. Brown, in a paper read to the In-
stitution of Mechanical Engineers, Lon-
don, and entitled “Economic Results of
Diesel-Electric Motive Power on the
Railways of USA.” Brown’s investiga-
tions were based on the authoritative
“Statistics of Railways of the United
States”, published annually by the Inter-
state Commerce Commission. His con-
clusions (headlined in the British journal
“Engineering” as “Diesels Bring Losses
to USA Railways”) were, briefly, as
follows:
“The all-embracing economies claimed
for diesel motive power do not appear
in the statistical record. The diesel loco-
motive has not revolutionised American
railway economics. In road service diesel
motive power has added to the financial
burden of the railways.”
What diesel interests have done, to-
gether with railway heads who too hastily
committed themselves to dieselisation, is
to ignore his findings (Brown’s paper
is “top secret” in railway circles out
here) and to put out a flood of publicity
designed to promote uncritical accep-
tance of diesels. Diesel publicity is based
on claims for much greater economy and
efficiency than is possible with steam
power. Rosy pictures are painted of
millions of pounds being saved annually
through diesels working 22 to 23 hours
a day, hauling heavy loads at high speeds
without stops for coal or water and
operating in multiple units to reduce the
wages bill. .
Traffic realities, such as intricacies of
timetabling and availability of full loads,
do not allow diesel locomotives in normal
Australian situations to average more
than some 15 hours’ daily running, even
when public convenience is ignored, as
it often is, in holding back trains for
working by them. This 15-hour daily
earning period, as it happens, is actually
conceded to steam locomotives in official
diesel statements.
Diesels can pull heavier loads than
equivalent steam engines only at speeds
below 20 m.p.h. and have no per-
formance advantage at normal operating
speeds. Diesel-hauled freights are able
to run at express speeds, when tabled to
do so, only because their loads do not
exceed those of express trains. NSW fast
trains hauled by diesel locomotives could
actually be operated at higher average
speeds (between stops) by steam express
engines, which maintain greater horse-
power at fast speeds.
Stops for water, shovelling down coal,
and fire-cleaning are at present necessary
for our steam engines on long runs, but
these can be eliminated through long-
tested techniques, including use of water
troughs and mechanical coal-pushers. A
steam-hauled Southern Aurora could
then make the Sydney-Albury run with
the existing one crew-change stop. If our
38-class steam locomotives, in accord-
ance With the best European practice,
were fitted with Giesl exhaust ejectors
and feed-water heaters, however, they
could cut present interstate timings
significantly. The cost of these improve-
ments, for all NSW major steam engines
and main lines, would be below that of
a handful of diesels.
Multiple-unit one-crew diesel opera-
tion does reduce the wages bill by con-
trast with double-hffaded steam power,
but by no more than a tiny fraction of
the amount by which total expenditure
is increased by large-scale purchase and
use of diesels. The purchase price of a
diesel-electric locomotive, owing to its
complexity and high import content, is
about twice that of an equivalent steam
engine which will haul similar payloads
for the same average daily period. How-
ever, in the light of experience here and
overseas, the diesel has less than half
the economic life of its steam counter-
part.
Maintenance costs are higher for
diesels than for steam engines because
there are more things to go wrong with
them, they do so much more frequently,
and more modifications (usually ex-
pensive ones, as with NSW diesels) have
to be made to suit local conditions. As
well, in Australia, diesels produce no
savings in fuel costs.
In NSW about 25 years ago, when
steam locomotive power reached a peak
of efficiency, engine mileages for each
officially-recorded instance of casualty

(lateness beyond a specified short time) or
failure (inability of an engine to haul its
train) were extremely high. Today, when
official policy requires that the barest
minimum of essential work be carried
out on steam engines, their casualfy-
failure figures are probably ten times
worse. But present figures for steam
engines are still rather better than those
for diesels, on which every attention is
lavished in order to secure the best
possible results from the costly invest-
ment they represent. With maximum
maintenance for both types, the steam
locomotive is obviously far more reliable
than the diesel.
There are grave industrial and national
aspects of our diesel policy. As they
are never officially admitted, one may
reasonably conclude that, as with
Brown’s findings, there is a conspiracy
of silence on them. Our coal industry
has been badly hit by reduced railway
demands for coal and the economic life
of coal towns has become depressed.
Closure of country steam locomotive
depots (all major diesel maintenance
being carried out at one central depot)
has injured rail-town economy. De-
centralisation of industry, of vital con-
cern if problems created by over-expan-
sion of capital cities are to be capable of
solution, has been given a sharp setback.
The strongest arguments against rail-
way dieselisation is that it is bound to
create an impossible military and civil
transport situation in the event of war
in the Australian sphere. Dependence
of diesels on imported oil fuel and vul-
nerable to enemy action would be a
national embarrassment when set against
the needs of the armed services and
essential road transport. Difficulties
associated with import content and un-
reliability would also play a part in dis-
rupting train movements.
If the future has not been safeguarded,
the present has not even been provided
for. In NSW the official war against
steam power has been carried to the
point at which steam engines have been
cut up. to save the minor expense of
putting them in order, before enough
diesels have been bought to replace them.
A serious shortage of engine power, made
worse bv 'unending diesel breakdowns,
has led to extensive daily cancellation of
loaded goods trains.
The trouble is that the US Ebasco
consultants of 1958 had stated that a
diesel would do the work of three large
steam locomotives. For railway heads
to question this doctrine, even in 1965,
would be an admission of waste of public
money over the Ebasco report. The
obvious and awkward truth that a main-
line diesel is no more powerful than any
of our mainline steam engines, except at
low speeds, and 'no more usable, is
never taken into account by these
executives, who apparently have no in-
tention of recognising facts which they
would find embarrassing.
Claims that dieselisation has converted
huge annual NSW Railway losses into
profits (though small ones) cannot be
entertained. Despite the glowing Ebasco
forecast of a £7,000,000 yearly saving
with diesel operation, losses remained
fairly constant until the Government
took over some £3,500,000 of the annual
railway interest bill and freight traffic
began to improve as a result of
industrial expansion, splendid wheat
seasons, and the opening of the Albury-
Melbourne standard-gauge line.
The argument that dieselisation, what-
ever its drawbacks, must be accepted on
the score of conformity with modern
world railway practice is as juvenile as
it is false. North America has certainly
fallen victim to dieselmania as much
as to planned obsolescence and tongue-in-
cheek advertising. It is also true that
British Railways (in a land of famous
steam performance and plentiful coal)
is committing an act of nationalised
stupidity in going diesel, with such
chaotic running as has been attacked in
the British Press as a public scandal and
has led the Post Office to threaten with-
drawal of railway mail contracts.
But the rest of the world picture is
brighter. European countries with
abundant hydro-electric power have com-
bined electric with steam and not diesel
traction. Germany, USSR, and India are
heavily involved in steam, with India
building large numbers of steam loco-
motives every year. Argentine, the only
South American country to have shown
much interest in diesels, is returning to
service all steam engines previously laid
aside for them and has adopted a policy
of preference for steam.
In NSW, as in other States, distances
and limited population do not make
high-capital-cost mainline electrification
an economic proposition. With the
assassination of steam well under way,
and with embarrassing numbers of diesels
to be given work which must reduce
existing confusion of train schedules as
far as possible, the task of quickly re-
gaining motive-power sanity will not be
easy. As a first step, existing diesels
should take over shunting, banking, and
heavy goods duties (the onlv fields in
which they are capable of showing to
some advantage), with steam engines per-
forming all the express, passenger, and
fast freight duties at present allotted ro
diesels. No more diesels ought to be put
into service.
When all steam locomotives of satis-
factory capacity (i.e., 38, 36. 35, and 32-
class engines for express and passenger
work, with Garratt and 59-class engines
for freight work) have been brought to
maximum efficiency and rostered for
full duty, there will not be enough of
them. A construction programme for
powerful modern steam locomotives,
equipped with latest technical devices,
should therefore be quickly undertaken.
A reasonable NSWGR aim would be to
attain the highest standard of European
steam practice and then use that position
as a basis to promote further steam
power development.

INVESTMENT
On Not Dropping Bricks
CRA’s slightly embarrassing subsidiary
rFoo much importance, perhaps, should
-*■ not be attached to the fact that CRA
attempted to sell off its brick manu-
facturing subsidiary last year. True,
chairman Sir Maurice Mawby seemed
rather taken back when a shareholders
question forced him to admit this at the
recent annual meeting. A somewhat
pregnant silence following his admission,
in front of 160-odd shareholders, was
concrete evidence of the fact that, no
matter how frank and chatty a company
may appear to be with its shareholders,
there were still matters which it preferred
them to know nothing about.
It was probably this which caused the
episode to be embarrassing, rather than
the mere fact that an attempt had been
made to sell Rio Tinto Brick Pty Ltd.
After all< it is fairly well on the cards
that a sell-out would have ultimately
taken place to one of the competitors
once the subsidiary had been established
and was making reasonable profits.
Directors have made it clear before to-
day that they are more interested in
development in the mining and allied
fields, about which they are considerably
better informed.
When the 75 p.c. interest in the
Sydney-based quarrying company Fitz-
patrick Industries was sold not so long
ago to Pioneer Concrete for more than
£1 million cash, it was stated that the
sale would enable the CRA management
to give more concentrated attention to
mining and associated industrial projects.
Under Sir Maurice, a mining man born
and bred in Broken Hill, the company
seems determined to maintain the role
in the mining industry which originally
made it famous.
Undoubtedly part of the reasoning
behind the move into bricks was to put
a scare into competitors and then sell
the operation to them at a handsome
capital profit. However, things did not
work out this way,, so a sale was
attempted at what was probably a sub-
stantial loss. The attempt was unsuccess-
ful. Now the group is trying to bring
the subsidiary into profitable operation.
The annual report showed that the assets
had been written down by almost
£550,000 and stated quite plainly that
1965 would see a write-down in paid
capital to a more serviceable level. Sir
Maurice told shareholders at the meet-
ing that an overseas expert has been
brought in to study the whole operation
and profits had been earned in the
current year.
A loss of around £83,000 was incurred
last year, and in 1963, the establishment
year, the loss was £193,000. Obviously

it would have been satisfactory to get
out at a small capital loss and avoid all
the drastic measures already made and
yet to come. Moreover, the solving of
present problems will involve the board
to an extent far greater than the sub-
sidiary really deserves. Time could be
lost on more important projects.
The ironic aspect of the whole busi-
ness is that Brick and Pipe, widely
believed to be the group to whom R. T.
Brick was offered, may rue the day that
they did not take it up CRA directors
are evidently determined to get profits
from their bricks. At full capacity, the
plant at Campbellfield (Melb.) can pro-
duce 25 million bricks a year. Originally
the plans included the establishment of
a second plant with the same capacity.
A revamped, reorganised R. T. Brick
could prove a formidable opponent in
an industry where few holds are barred.
Food From Mr Whippy?
Tt is a debatable point whether the
catering industry has room for yet
another starter. Yet hot on the heels of
Mr Whippy’s intention of gaining public
listing comes a directors’ announcement
that the group is considering expan-
sion into the catering field. However,
which sector of catering is not disclosed.
In a recent story on catering The
Bulletin's impression was that the need
for caterers was well filled at all stages
indoor, outdoor, private and official.
There is some room, perhaps, for specia-
lised catering at sporting functions and
the like and this could well be the field
Mr Whippy Holdings is considering.
Or maybe, with the giant Forte's hotel
catering and food manufacturing group
of the UK behind Mr Whippy in Austra-
lia [Forte’s, through its subsidiary Mr
Whippy (Holdings) Ltd of Britain, owns
53.37 p.c. of the capital in the local
venture] a chain of self-serve cafes is
envisaged.
But whatever field of catering Mr
Whippy has fin mind here, it will have
to face the high wages bill caterers com-
plained about in The Bulletin story.

8 p.c. after floating to the public lists.
Earning rate on ordinary capital of £3
million for 1963-64 is expected to be
shown at a mediocre 13 p.c. odd when
the memorandum for the sale of shares
is released.
This will offer the Australian public
a third of the capital in 10s. shares at
a premium of 7s. 6d. each quite a
price to ask for such uninspiring divi-
dend and earning rates. Obviously the
mother company intends to make as
much as it can by selling out to us
colonials.
Considering the ungenerous nature of
the deal and the antics of Prime Minister
Wilson at home, one can’t help but feel
that the decision to offer Australians a
shareholding was not inspired by any
motherly feelings. Rather, the motive
seems more to move the Australian
interests 7 away from Mr Wilson’s socialist
measures, and as quickly as possible. This
is evidenced by the non-inclusion of
Cockatoo Docks in the offer.
After all, that subsidiary made a loss
of some £244,000 last year. Including
these figures in the group result for last
year could have made local acceptance
of the shares rather difficult, despite the
fact that lan Potter and Co. and Aus-
tralian United Corporation are under-
writing the float. Directors chose to by-
pass this subsidiary and issue shares now,
instead of waiting for it to return to
profits.
They may have only needed to wait
about a year anyhow. The subsidiary
operates the ship-building docks on
Cockatoo Island, near Balmain. Most of
the business is in fulfilling the defence
requirements of the Royal Australian
Navy. Last year’s losses were mainly
attributable to the construction of the
Empress of Australia, a contract which
was something of a departure from
normal activities.
Expansion Friction
IY/|elbourne-based Anti Friction Bear-
ings is in something of a predica-
ment. Rapid expansion in the December
six months almost doubled net profits,
but the interim dividend has to be
omitted in order to provide cash for the
rapid growth which is still going on.
The 1963-64 year was the first, although
not complete, year on the public lists
(listed in January, 1964) and a maiden
rate of 8 p.c. was established. Due to
the initial expenses of a new subsidiary,
profits fell from £22,964 to £17,073 to
equal 9 p.c. on capital after deducting
£3OOO odd for preference dividends.
The profit in the latest half-year came
out at £12,731, compared with £6356
previously. After deducting the prefer-

Who discovered SINGAPORE?
We did! The travel agent started it by explaining it wouldn't cost a penny
more to stop-over in Singapore, on our way to Europe. On those terms who
would miss the chance to go on a voyage of discovery!
So we came to Singapore. The friendly, cosmopolitan people welcomed us
to their fascinating country and we were set fair to uncover an array of
spectacle and excitement that gave real meaning to the saying—‘You see
more of the Orient in Singapore.’ Take a glimpse at this magical island
with us and you too will be taking the first steps towards discovering wonder-
ful Singapore.
SIGHTSEEING Why see the world when
there’s Singapore? See the rest of the world by all means —
but don’t miss Singapore! Where else do three great races present the
many faces of their culture, their pageantry and their costume and their
customs. Only on this fabulous Island can you see the Festival of lights—
The Mooncake Festival —The Chinese New Year celebrations —The Thaipusam
devotions and the Malay pageant of Hari Raya Puasa. Only in Singapore
can you, in one day, visit the Muslim Mosques—the Indian and the Chinese
temples—the Tiger Balm Gardens and the House of Jade.
Even whilst you are marvelling at this many splendoured spectacle, you
thread your way through a tapestry of costume and colour that excites your
eyes as only Singapore can.

ence requirement for the six months, this
represents a not very much improved
earning rate of 10.7 p.c., calculated on
an annual basis. Herein lies the pre-
dicament— expansion must be financed
but the low earning rate makes it almost
suicidal to borrow from outside or issue
new shares for cash. Extra charges in
the first case and higher capital in the
latter could leave an 8 p.c. dividend un-
covered until (and if) expansion turned
out to be successful.
So the withholding of the dividend
remains the only sensible solution. The
question is, how long will this method of
financing continue to be necessary? Until
earning rates go higher is the obvious
answer, although directors say that con-
sideration will be given to the dividend
when the full year’s results are at hand.
It seems that the 8 p.c. rate will not be
maintained if further expansion is being
planned during 1965-66.
The company specialises in supplying
imported bearings for the automotive,
agricultural and general industrial fields.
Most of them are outside the scope of
tariff restrictions which apply to such
products. Few compete, with locally
made items and most come from Britain
and Austria.
More Losses
announcement of a further and
A greater loss by Pacific Acceptance
Corporation during the December half-
year is more discouragement to share-
holders whose ss. shares now stand
around the Bd. level. From a £70,000
red book entry in the December half-
year of 1963, the company has lost more
ground with a £80,058 deficit in the six
months to December last year.
The latest loss lifts the group’s total
to £980,339. Against the latest result
was charged £22,921 for doubtful debts
and £44,566 for interest on fixed-term
loans. The company's official manager
says the loss was due to the non-sale of
real estate assets. There was thus a lack
of funds to facilitate selling off these
assets, he said.
Steady Sugar
pH’EN though the price of sugar fell
during the year, Fairymead Sugar
Co. Ltd was able to maintain profit and
dividend in 1964. To be completely
precise, parent profit fell, but the fall of

1962 while earning rate, due to a place-
ment during the year, moves back from
27.7 p.c. to 25.8 p.c. It still gives more
than double the dividend requirement.
Directors sound content with the result,
saying it is satisfactory in view of the
considerably lower prices obtained for
sugar.
During the year the company used
irrigation to offset drought conditions
and crushed a record 421,710 tons of
cane. The cane yielded 55,613 tons,
compared with the previous year’5.„55,767
tons. The 1964 crushing is only 971
tons lower than the 1962 record. Pro-
duction in the latest year could have been
greater but for wet weather during the
crushing period.
However, good rains have now fallen
on all the company’s properties in
Queensland. Improvements are being
made to the milling plant which will
make possible more profitable extraction
of sugar from the cane. NSW farmlands
purchased last year so far have produced
little income, while the group’s cattle
operations near Rockhampton were the
most unprofitable of all Fairymead’s
activities.
Investment Blues?
Tndustrial and Pastoral Holdings
-*■ Ltd, the Melbourne-based invest-
ment company, will need a smart boost
to profits if the three-year-old 74- p.c.
dividend is to be maintained in future
years. A one-for-five par issue of 20s.
shares is to be made, the second issue
in the group’s 15-year listed history. It
will lift paid capital by £45,000 to
£270,000.
Earning rate last year was only 8.6
p.c. If one calculates the £19,000 profit
on capital after the issue the result is
a bare 7.5 p.c. This, of course, assumes
that profits will not gain much by the
time the new shares rank for dividend,
and there is little evidence to suggest
they should. True the £19,000 was the
best result for some time, but the com-
pany’s profits have a habit of leaping
about. They were £15,000 in 1961,
jumped to £17,000 in 1962, went back
to £16,000 in 1963 and up again last
year.
It would be a pity if dividends had
to be cut or omitted for a year if a
result could not cover the normal 74- p.c.
distribution. The stock has always been
one for those seeking a steady and
relatively high income from the dividend
yield. The small premium which the
market places on the shares will produce
little or nothing in the way of capital
gains. One must sell to get the benefit of

Perhaps there will be some more en-
couraging news when the directors come
forth with their “fuller information” on
the proposal. So far they have only said
that the funds will be used for ex-
pansion, “which it is believed may be
satisfactorily achieved under present
market conditions”.
Higher Dividend
'W/’estern Titanium, NL, the WA pro-
ducer of mineral sands, could well
increase its dividend for the 1964-65
year to January 31 last. Last week’s
annual report from the company showed
that profit for the year had jumped from
£lOl,OOO to £198,000, not including the
net gain of £24,000 made on the sale of
the rights to mine Greenbushes tin.
Dividends are usually declared at the
annual meeting, to be held this year on
May 25.
Last year’s payout was 4id. or 7i p.c.
on each ss. share. Paid capital ranking
for the dividend is higher by £104,500
this year, but this should have little
effect on directors’ decision. To maintain
the payout, only £75,000 of the profit
would be required, so there is plenty of
scope for an increase.
The fact that the current year should
establish yet another substantial increase
-will also provide strong argument for
increasing the distribution. The capacity
of the ilmenite plant is to be lifted from
156,000 to between 200,000 and 250,000
tons a year. Directors say in the annual
report that demand and prices for the
mineral have continued to be excellent
in the current year.
Real Estate Troubles
Qydney real estate developer C. H.
Degotardi Ltd incurred a loss in the
half year to December 31. The loss ex-
cludes some pre-acquisition profits which
emerged during the period, directors say
in their interim report. In the report
there is no mention of how' much the
group lost or of an interim dividend.
Comparative figures are not available as
the company, formerly Salamander Salt
Ltd, did not start real estate operations
until April last year.
Directors say trading results were ad-
versely affected by the company’s short-
age of subdivisions for sale “due pri-
marily to delays in obtaining develop-
ment and other approvals”. Consequently
sales for the half year were lower than
budgeted. An improvement in sales is
currently being achieved.
Little or no interest is being shown in
the shares which last sold at Is. or half
par value.

Profitable Car Insurance
The practice of Vehicle and General
Tf anyone today said he was going to
A specialise in motor vehicle insurance
and make a profit, the laughter of know-
ledgeable insurance men would ring very
ironically. Yet this is what two youngish
Englishmen have done, and profited hand-
somely.
Consider these figures: from 1961,
when profit was £15,000, their company,
Vehicle and General Insurance, lifted
UK earnings to £258,000 in 1964 and
expects to top the £400,000 mark this
year. The 1964 figure represents an earn-
ing rate of about 20 p.c. on shareholders’
funds of £li million and the loss ratio
was only 47 p.c.
This loss ratio is quite staggering in
the light of the overall British ratio of
more than 100 p.c. In 1962 Commercial
Union in Britain, for instance, finished
up 9.2 p.c. on the wrong side of the loss
ledger; Phoenix lost 10.6 p.c. The over-
all motor insurance loss ratio in Australia
is believed to be between 70 and 75 p.c.,
plus 30 to 35 p.c. for agents’ commission,
administration, etc. Motor vehicle insur-
ance in Australia, therefore, is no more
profitable than elsewhere in the world.
The brains behind Vehicle and Gen-
eral in the UK are Tony Hunt, an ag-
gressive, anti-Establishment 44-year-old
(managing director), and his quietly
spoken partner, Reg Burr, 42.
Closely following a policy of “selective”
insurance, the company has been able to
minimise, and even reduce, the size of
claims expenses. “We’re making the bad
driver good by economics,” said Tony
Hunter, “by hitting him where it hurts
most —his pocket.” V and G will not in-
sure drivers with even a doubtful claims
record and encourages those who are
claim-free to stay that way by offering
a maximum 50 p.c. no claims bonus.
In Britain certain types of people are
not insurable as far as „V and G is con-
cerned. Publicans are one, while jour-
nalists are extremely bad risks. Public
servants, on the other hand, get a 10 p.c.
discount. In addition to the selective pol-
icy the company also offers a 5 p.c. re-
duction on premiums where husband and
wife only will be driving the car. Where
only one driver is named on the insurance
policy the reduction is 10 p.c. And where
one driver only is named, claims will not
be entertained where damage is caused by
a driver other than the one on the policy.
“By doing this we are gradually get-
ting toward what we want,” said Tony
Hunt. “We want to get insurance to the
stage where it’s the person, not the car,
who is insured. We'd like to issue
policies to people limiting the value of
cars they can drive. For instance, if a
driver is insured up to the £2OOO mark,
he can’t drive a Rolls, or if he does and
prangs it, then he is liable, not us.”
Hunt and Burr came to Australia a
fortnight ago to look over their local
operation, recently-listed Vehicle and
General Insurance Co. (Australia) Ltd.
It started operations in Victoria less than
a year ago and, already is profitable. It
proposes to operate basically on the
parent company’s lines, but with a few
exceptions. Insurance risks here will not
be classified by occupation, for instance,
and the £25 excess at present'charged
to drivers under 25 years of age will not
be applicable on all claims.
Under the present set-up most tariff
insurance companies make the £25 excess
mandatory whether or not the under-25
driver causes the damage, or if the car is
stolen or burnt out. V and G will not
charge the £25 if the car is damaged
while stationary, burnt out or stolen. In
all other cases the £25 will apply.
It may seem a gamble to introduce
such a selective system here, though the
economics of V and G’s operations, after
less than a full year, appear sound.
Sterner methods of selectivity are, of
course, being considered by much larger
Australian companies and could well give
the careful motorist a better deal.

SECURITY ANALYSIS
EMI Appears Fully Priced
Little prospect of marked capital growth
A bout three months ago the directors
of EMI (Australia) Limited reported
that turnover for the first half of the
1964-65 year was up 17 p.c. and “in
consequence, the net profit after tax
showed a most satisfactory increase”.
The interim dividend was raised from
6k to 7 p.c. and this was done in view
of the increase in profits. Nevertheless,
the shares are now selling at close to the
low point for 1965 and have not been
lower than this since 1962. At the cur-
rent price of 21s. 3d. the dividend yield,
assuming that the year's dividend will be
not less than 15 p.c., is 3.5 p.c. The
earnings yield based on the 1963-64 earn-
ings disclosed by the company would be
7.6 p.c.
To a large extent the general market
decline is responsible for this fall in
price and it may perhaps be unrealistic
to seek any other reason. However,
there are still a number of stocks selling
at prices which show yields considerably
less than EMI. It is noteworthy that,
for the last three years, EMI has been
a low dividend yield stock. As examples,
AWA is currently selling at 265. to show
a dividend yield of 3.1 p.c. and an
earnings yield of 5.4 p.c.; Pye is selling
at 19s. 9d. to show a dividend yield of
2.5 p.c. and an earnings yield of 9.9 p.c.
The two companies mentioned seem to
be engaged in activities which are rea-
sonably comparable with EMI, although
Pye has a stake in the automotive parts
industry through its interest in the
Bendix-Tecnico group. The main diffi-
culty in each case is to determine their
interests in the field of electronics as
opposed to their interests in the field of
durable consumer goods.
EMI (Australia) became a listed public
company in the second half of 1957
when 500,000 ordinary 20s. shares had
been placed with the public at par.
Electrical and Musical Industries of the
UK held 500,000 ordinary shares and
300,000 deferred shares. These deferred
shares were subsequently converted to
ordinary shares in 1960, so that today the
UK parent holds just under 62 p.c. of
the capital, assuming that it has not sold
any of its holding or acquired any further
shares by market purchases.
The subsidiary companies which have
received mention in the published ac-
counts are EMI Finance Corporation Pty
Ltd (hire-purchase financier) and Castle
Music Pty Ltd (music publisher). It
would seem that in 1962-63 these two
subsidiaries made together £33,665 after
tax. The 1963-64 year is distorted by
bad debts written off by the finance
company. In 1962-63, the profit of the
parent company was only £38,480 less
than the group profit. This suggests that
the remaining subsidiaries, the Marconi-
phone Company Pty Ltd, Television
Patents Pty Ltd, EMI Sales and Service
(NSW) Pty Ltd and EMI Sales and Ser-
vice (Vic.) Pty Ltd, contributed less than
£5OOO to the total group profit of
£408,809. It is quite undoubted that the
dividends received from the associated
companies in that year, at £57,500, were
far more important to the group profit
than the profits from the subsidiary
companies.
These associate companies consist of
EMI Electronics Ltd (which recently ten-
dered successfully for the service and
maintenance of the space tracking sta-
tion to be built in the Orroral Valley,
ACT), Thomas Electronics Holdings Pty
Ltd (the parent company of the Thomas
television tube manufacturing group) and
probably others apart from EMI-Vise Pty
Ltd, where the investment of £4OOO in
50 p.c. of the equity has now been writ-
ten off. As the total investment in shares
in and advances to unlisted companies
stood at just over £200,000 in lune,
1964, and as the investment in Thomas
Electronics cost £120,000. it would seem
that the latter is by far the most import-
ant investment.
THhe foregoing would seem to indicate
A that the manufacturing and distrib-
ution of radio and television receivers and
of gramophone records is certainly the
most important part of the group activi-
ties, followed by the associated “electro-
nic” companies. Sales of durable con-
sumer goods have not been made without
difficulty in recent years and in the direc-
tors’ report of 1963 it was stated: “The
company is owed substantial amounts by
the Reid Murray and Inglis Electrix or-
ganisations but due to guarantee arrange-
ments existing in both cases it is not
possible at present to determine the
amount of bad debts involved. Stock-
holders are assured that the provision for
doubtful debts is well in excess of any
possible charges in this connection.”
While these bad debts are not signifi-
cant, they do cause problems in assessing
the trend in earnings, particularly when
the tax provision does not bear a very
close relationship to the disclosed net
profit after tax. I have, therefore, chosen
to look at the gross profit before tax,
depreciation and interest on loans and
before any provisions for doubtful debts
and any bad debt write-offs (so far as
they have been disclosed). This figure,
when related to the total capital invested,
seems to indicate a very slight upward
trend in profitability, provided that the
1961-62 year is regarded as exceptional.
If it were not for this ratio, the picture
would be much more gloomy on the basis
of an analyst’s usual adjustments to earn-
ings. The earnings per share in 1963-64
would be almost identical with those for
1958-59, even though there has been
no watering of the equity capital by new
issues and a sum greater than the sub-
scribed equity capital has been ploughed
back during this period. Over this same
period, dividends per share have in-
creased at the average annual compound
rate of 5.3 p.c. Although there has been
no increase from 1961-62 to 1963-64,
another increase seems to be on the way.
The amount of this increase is not yet
known, but it would seem that the nor-
mal dividend is to be increased from
121 p.c. to 14 p.c., so that the total will
depend on the amount of the “bonus”
dividend, which has been If p.c. for the
last three years. If this is maintained
and the rate becomes 15f p.c., the aver-
age annual compound rate of increase
in dividends per share since 1959 will
become 6.2 p.c. If the total dividend is
15 p.c., as suggested earlier in this article,
the rate of growth will only be slightly
higher than before.
Even at what would appear to be
depressed prices today, there seems little
prospect of any marked capital growth
from EMI (Australia) in the foreseeable
future. Dividend growth rates would
suggest that the shares would still be
fully priced at current levels.

BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
Some Problems in Liquidity
Yet Moran and Cato still expansive
rpHE March-April setback in share
prices on Australian stock exchanges,
whilst not creating quite as many
“bargain buys” as optimists would have
us believe, definitely served to bring a
wide range of stocks into a more attrac-
tive price bracket. Melbourne-based
Moran and Cato (Australia) Ltd, retail
grocery chain operator, was one of these.
At the time of writing the 10s. shares
have just recovered a few pence to 19s.
6d. Yield from the four-year-old 10 p.c.
dividend is 5 p.c. after allowing for
brokerage (4d.).
The scrip offers investors a steady and
reliable income each year, with the pros-
pect of small capital gains in the long
term. These features existed before the
market setback, of course, but the divi-
dend yield, the prime reason for buying
just now, was much lower. Having regard
to these facts, it would be true to say
that the shares are more realistically
valued now than they have been for
some time.
The capital gains in prospect for the
long run are more likely to come from
a general rise in market prices than a
shareholders’ issue. Issues have never
been a feature of the M and C set-up.
Since listing in 1950 three have been
made, but they were all packed into two
financial years. In 1958-59 was a one-
for-four bonus and a one-for-ten at par.
Then in 1959-60 the present holding
company was formed to take over the
operating group on the basis of two
shares for each one held. This may not
have been an issue in the true sense,
yet to all intents and purposes it was a
virtual two-for-one bonus to shareholders.
The move created a paid capital in the
new company of twice that in the old
group. As the move was not really ex-
pansionary, profits gained very little and
in 1959-60 earning rate toppled from
28.2 p.c. to 1 3.5 p.c. The accompanying
table shows a gradual improvement to
the present 15.6 p.c. At this level an
issue is out of the question unless it is
a small cash one for expansionary pur-
poses.
While shareholders may not have bene-
fited capital-wise from the reconstruction,
annual income has definitely improved.
Present dividend rate is 10 p.c. This was
the rate paid from listing until the re-
construction, although two extremely
buoyant years, 1957-58 and 1958-59, en-
abled temporary lifts to 121 p.c. and
15 p.c. respectively.
The present dividend should be main-
taxed in the current year and for many
years to come. However, it does seem
that the cover will be a little narrower
than in 1963-64. In the interim report,
directors said that profit was “slight!}
lower” in six months to January 31 al-
though sales had shown a “moderate in-
crease”. This was due to higher expenses
and the increased rate of taxation.
If a slightly lower profit is earned this
year, the drop in the post-dividend sur-
plus could prompt directors into making
the small cash issue mentioned above.
This may be unfortunate, as the market
would mark the shares down if the divi-

dend cover was already narrow. But the
group does appear to be in need of
ready cash. Working capital in the table
shows an increasingly negative trend. Ex-
pansion goes on nevertheless and last
year loan capital of £158,000 was brought
in. This in itself could be a problem,
since it represents deposits and a mort-
gage repayable in 1966.
While this liquidity problem is a rather
severe one, its solution may be easier
than one would expect. Changes in the
grocery game over recent years have
enabled M and C to close down its dis-
tributing and credit wholesale activities.
This means that less stock can be carried,
cartage costs will be lowered, more space
will be ava lable in existing warehouses,
less office accounting will be necessary,
and the risk of bad debts will be reduced.
In short, the group should have more
liquid funds on hand.
In addition, capital profits are expected
on the sale of land originally purchased
for warehouses and office expansion, now
made unnecessary. Seven acres near Syd-
ney come into this category. Four acres
have been frozen for highway extensions,
at a “satisfactory” price, and the remain-
ing three have been put up for sale. At
Nunawading (Vic.), two and a half acres
of a seven and a half acre site have also
been sold “satisfactorily”. The sale of the
remaining five acres is expected to be
“reasonably profitable.”
So there are solutions to the liquidity
problem. Shareholders should ensure that
they are brought up to date on the posi-
tion at this year’s annual meeting. Direc-
tors have not brought the position to the
fore in the past.
Today's holding and listed company,
formed in 1960, is non-operating and
owns all the shares in Moran and Cato
Pty Ltd. This is the retail operating
company. It conducts 90 stores in Vic-
toria (Melbourne and country centres),
Tasmania, Mt Gambier, Albury and
Deniliquin. This subsidiary holds all
the shares in Moran and Cato (NSW)
Pty Ltd, the retail operating company for
NSW conducting 80 stores in Sydney and
numerous country centres.
It also holds all the shares of Aus-
tralian Wholesale Grocery Pty Ltd, the
wholesale operating company for Vic-
toria, and Sydney Grocery Pty Ltd, the
wholesale operating company for NSW.
The activities of these two are now very
minor and very limited.
The group's expansion of recent years
came as a logical step once the majority
of existing stores had been converted to
the demands of the self-service era. In
Victoria last year, shops were opened at
Altona, Boronia, Yarram, Kerang and St
Arnaud. At balance date, work was well
ahead on enlarged or alternative prem-
ises at Rosebud, Oakleigh, Box Hill, Wil-
liamstown, and Greensborough. Several
existing stores were waiting for exten-
sions. In NSW, shop sites were bought at
Chatswood, Rose Bay and Liverpool, in
addition to a site adjoining the existing
store at Haberfield.
The accompanying table shows in
figures the decline of the working capital
situation. Fixed assets have grown stead-
ily, reflecting expansion. Ordinary capi-
tal holds steady. Despite the latest rise,
loan capital is still low and provides scope
for further expansionary cash. Profit and
earning rates show slow overall growth,
but still cover the dividends adequately.
The rise in dividend yields and the fall
in share prices reflect the etfects of the
1960 reconstruction.
To sum up: buy for the income re-
turn only. Profits this year may be lower
but the dividend will go on unchanged.
A share issue at this stage would not be
welcome, especially if it necessitates a cut
in dividends, and thus income. If profits
maintain their growth trend of the last
three years over the long term, market
price rises will provide more welcome and
secure capital gains than a share issue.
Finally, buying may best be left until
October. The announcement of a lower
profit and the possibility of severe liquid-
ity problems could take the shares to a
level where the dividend yields are even
more attractive.

STEGGLES HOLDINGS LTD
Drought Brings
Some Gain
fpHE “ill wind” of the drought has
proved a boon to Steggles Holdings
Ltd, for the company has had difficulty
in meeting the demand for livestock feed
during the current year.
But it is not only in this section of
the group’s activities that directors have
been able to report booming business.
Increased sales and the need for addi-
tional storage space were both a result of
the expansion of poultry processing and
associated activities.
In fact the poultry processing business,
with its various facets such as the opera-
tion of chicken hatcheries, manufacture
of poultry feeds and the eventual pro-
cessing of poultry for table consumption,

is playing an increasingly larger part in
the company’s affairs.
Steggles was formed in 1958 to acquire
two companies which had operated in
the Newcastle and Wyong districts for
some time as stock, poultry feed, produce
and bag merchants. Stock exchange
listing was obtained late in the same
year, when 230,400 ss. shares were
placed with the public at par. Paid-up
capital on listing was £252,500, all in
ordinary shares.
Main manufacturing facilities were
eventually built at Beresfield, near New-
castle, but expansion was continued with
the acquisition of businesses at Wyong,
Windsor and Taree. Most of these
acquisitions were financed by share
placements, though shareholders have
participated in three cash issues—a one-
for-five at par in 1960, one-for-four also
at par in 1962, and late last year a one-
for-five at a premium of 2s. 6d. a share.
Paid capital is now £600,000.
The two latest issues have been made
to finance the company’s expansion into
the chicken business. A modern pro-
cessing plant has been built at Beresfield,
with extensive cold storage facilities,
while equipment has also been installed
to handle bulk feed deliveries.
Profit has more than doubled from
£42,158 to £91,525 in the past five years,
although, because of the increases in
capital, earning rate has risen only from
16.7 p.c. to last year’s 18.3 p.c. Never-
theless, earnings have given a good
coverage to the 10 p.c. dividend paid
each year since listing. Directors have
indicated that they expect no difficulty
in maintaining this rate on the recently
increased capital.
The latest accounts show that the
company is still ploughing a great deal
of its funds into fixed assets, particularly
plant and machinery, as the plant at
Beresfield is expanded. At last balance
date (June 30), plant and machinery
appeared in the books at cost £483,005

less a depreciation provision of £132,872.
A year earlier the figures were £398,329
and £98,159.
Much of this expansion was financed
by increased bank overdraft, up from
£138,419 to £181,474. Trade debtors,
up from £253,868 to £309,482, were
matched by a rise in trade liabilities from
£143,068 to £196,182.
The reserve position is strong, with
capital reserves at last balance date total-
ling £220,685, sufficient, almost, for a
one-for-two bonus issue on the then
paid-up capital of £500,000. The recent
premium issue raised an additional
£50,000 in capital reserves.
Intangibles appear in the books at
£204,639 and are principally goodwill on
consolidation (£204,171). Subject to
these items, net assets backing of the
ss. units at last balance date was 6s. Bd.
The shares are currently selling around
11s. 3d., near the best level for this year,
and the company’s future appears sound.

SPECULATOR’S DIARY
A Display of Confidence
And return to an old faithful
speculator thought that he’d been
relatively active in the market until
he read the last episode of Mary Breaker.
The stockmarket is not such a dull place
after all!
Since last week the market has moved
several points one way and then the
other. The leading question is where
does it go from here. If we take the
advice of one of the most prominent
Melbourne brokers (quoted in this
column about a month ago), the band-
waggon would be heavily weighted down
with purchases. If, on the other hand,
Sydney was our home town, it’s possible
that we’d be a client of a large Sydney
broker, whose last words of advice were
still to be highly wary of ordinary shares.
In between, there have been several
brokers to predict the market moving
sideways.
I go along with this last lot, with my
own qualification that the market will
start to turn up by July. So it was that
I approached the industrial market with
more confidence than for a long time.
And what better representative in this
market to choose than my old faithful,
Hanimex. While this company has been
out of the portfolio, it has nevertheless
carried on in its usual impressive style.
It quickly shook aside any doubts about
the English operations being affected by
the UK surcharge introduced in Novem-
ber. To quote the interim report on this
aspect: "Our United Kingdom company
raised its sales volume and profits and
budgets to maintain this trend during the
January to June, 1965, period.”
Elsewhere, Hanimex has continued to
do well. For those who like off-beat
places for Australian manufacturers,
they should be satisfied with Hanimex’s
effort in Canada. Sales volume there is
“expected to increase substantially”. So
good has group trading been that direc-
tors decided to pay an interim 5 p.c.
as well as still proposing to pay the final
dividend of 15 p.c. The dividend cover
in each of the last three years has been
2J, so this could well mean that earning
rate in the current year will be in the
vicinity of 50 p.c.
This would then mean that both earn-
ings and dividends have been compound-
ing at the rate of about 30 p.c. per
annum for the last four years. Put an-
other way, it means that dividends and
earnings per share double themselves
every three years. Expressed yet another
way, if this rate of growth was main-
tained the company could make a l-for-3
bonus issue every year and still maintain
the earning rate and dividend rate. Not
that Hanimex is likely to make a bonus
issue. This is because the chairman con-
siders such issues do not add to the
intrinsic worth of the company. On
the other hand, issued capital should
bear some relation to the size and profit-
ability of group operations.
With the shares still selling at only
three times their par value, the market
is less impressed about the company
than I am. Still, I’m happy with my
purchase of 500 shares at 15s. 6d.
If the market price of Hanimex
seemed low to me, so also was the price
of A. V. Jennings when it was under 10s.
Industries come and go in popularity
with the stock market. Building at the
moment is out and this would seem a
part explanation for the depressed price.
But one cannot escape the fact tha't the
record in recent years has been excellent
and that earning rate this year should
be at least equal to last year’s rate of
30 p.c. As far as I was concerned, this
argument was strong enough to buy 500
shares at 9s. 9d.
The subtractions from the portfolio
were United Telecasters and Hunt Bros.
United Telecasters so far has failed to
recover above Bs. I therefore went
merrily ahead and concluded the trans-
action with a £62 profit. Hunt Bros
was a case of taking a profit of £l6 on
the sharp rise to 2s. lid.
Transactions for the week were:
SOLD
1000 United Telecasters, 11/- £537
1000 Hunt Bros, 2/11 £l4l
BOUGHT
500 A. V. Jennings, 9/9 £250
500 Hanimex, 15/6 £398
This still leaves me in debit with an
amount of £612 owing.

THE MAN ON THE LAND
Corriedales and Communists
New slant on the merino ban
By FRANK SMYTHE
A questioner was told in the House of
■ Representatives at Canberra that the
sale of corriedale stud sheep to Commu-
nist China did not concern the Govern-
ment. The sale was merely a matter of
private trade.
What the Minister, answering in the
absence of the Trade Minister, Mr
McEwen, really meant was that trade
and politics were two distinctly different
things. This transaction was one of trade,
and as such was not involved with ideo-
logical differences of government, or even
with a little killing between the participa-
ting countries on the side.
The Australian Government, however,
does interfere with private export trading
—and precisely in sheep. For 36 years
Australia, under Liberal and Labor
Governments, has banned the sale abroad
of merinos. The ban, imposed in the
“depression” by the Scullin Government,
has been the subject of agitations almost
annually during the last 15 years or
more, but has stood firm as a rock.
Almost every year during his term of
office Mr McEwen has told some Mem-
ber of Parliament, “The Government has
no intention of lifting the ban.”
Once, in 1952, when all State Minis-
ters for Agriculture were reported to be
in favor of relaxing the prohibition, Mr
McEwen announced that Cabinet had
made a careful review of the policy
behind it. Cabinet had decided that the
embargo would remain unchanged.
So the Government has stood firm and
so have many woolgrowers (the NSW
Graziers’ Association, which always sup-
ported the ban on a majority vote, in
1958 rejected a proposal for a referen-
dum).
Whether the embargo serves any good
purpose has never been abundantly
apparent. It serves less now with the
amazing growth of the corriedale
abroad. The position in a nutshell was
expressed by an American visitor at last
Sydney Royal Show. He said, “I came
over to buy some merino stud sheep.
I can’t have merinos, so I’m buying cor-
riedales.”
Evolved from the merino and a British
longwool sheep, the,corriedale is valued
for its wool. We should make no mis-
take about that. In the wool section of
the 1963 Sydney Sheep Show a corrie-
dale fleece won the reserve grand cham-
pionship, being placed second only to a
merino finewool. And the judges were
technical people in wool.
In the latest transaction, corriedale
breeders have shipped to Communist
China 10 stud rams and 100 ewes,
valued at £20,000. With the rams making
as much as 500 guineas each, the sheep
were gathered from eight leading Austra-
lian corriedale studs and were carefully
examined by officers of the NSW Depart-
ment of Agriculture. In other words,
they were equal to the best of our cor-
riedale stud sheep.
When the consignment left Sydney
port it was announced that, if the sheep
thrived under Chinese conditions, a big
export of stud corriedales to that coun-
try would develop. Dr Sol Goldberg,
Sydney Macquarie Street surgeon and
NSW grazier, who organised the sale,
went immediately to Communist China
to explore the “possibilities”.
This is only a beginning in the sale
of Australian corriedale sheep to the
Communists. Russia was the first coun-
try recently to answer an invitation from
the Australian Corriedale Association to
attend a World Corriedale Conference
later this year in Melbourne. Its dele-
gates are extremely unlikely to leave
Australia empty-handed.
Australia’s embargo on the export of
merino stud sheep was imposed osten-
sibly to prevent this country losing its
premier place in the world as a producer
of fine spinning wool, which has been,
so often, called “our heritage”. Whether
this is morally right or wrong is beside
the point. The question at issue is whe-
ther Australia has gained anything by it.
It is true that Australia is not the only
merino country in the world. Neither
are its climates dissimilar to those of
some other countries. With an absence
of an Australian source of supply for
rams (some people say “because of it”)
Russia has built up the standard of its
flocks with imports from Saxony. It
can well be that its scientists, which lead
the world in other directions, have not
been amiss to the value of breeding up
sheep which might rival the Australian
type.

said then that Russia was on the way
to replacing Australia as the world’s
biggest sheep-producing nation. He said
Russia had begun well by enriching its
flocks with Australian merinos in the
late ’twenties (which suggested that the
export ban if anything was too late). In
1960 an Australian studbreeder visiting
Russia said that, while Russian wool pro-
duction (from 60 million sheep) did not
threaten Australia’s, Russian merino-
breeding methods and quality of wool
were a challenge.
There can hardly be a doubt, there-
fore, that in Russia, and from Russia to
China, a threat to Australia’s “supre-
macy” in wool has developed, despite the
Australian embargo. But it "would not
appear that the ban was imposed, or
has been sustained for 36 years, entirely
on that score. At the outset it had some
relationship with the price overseas
sheep owners were prepared to pay for
our rams.
Significantly, it came into force on the
heels of sales of rams to South African
buyers at record prices. Local breeders
precipitated it by complaining that they
could not compete with the South Afri-
can prices and therefore were being
deprived of the use of Australia’s best
rams. It might be assumed, then, that
if the prices had been lower the embargo
would never have been sought or im-
posed.
On the bigger issue, a claim, which
runs parallel with the action of corrie-
dale breeders, is that Australia must gain
in the long run by assisting other coun-
tries, through a distribution of stud ani-
mals, to upgrade an end-product, such as
wool, on the world market. It is not,
however, our “duty” to do so, as the
chairman of IWS, Sir William Gunn, in
the USA recently seemed to imply.
Whether America should get our best
merino stud rams would seem to rest
on American co-operation in breaking
down wool tariffs.
To make an embargo “differentiate” be-
tween one country and another, in peace
time, or even to be conditional on some
country’s trading practices, would hardly
be feasible. This is possibly a pity, be-
cause it would seem sensible to have a
free sale of stud sheep between members
of the International Wool Secretariat
Australia, South Africa and New Zealand
—who have a common interest in world
wool marketing.
It is apparent that the sale abroad of
corriedale stud sheep, which has grown
up alongside the embargo on merinos, Is
already having an influence on the world
wool trade. Countries of South America
which have bought large numbers of the
Australian corriedale for the improve-
ment of their flocks are now setting up
wool boards with the help of the Inter-
national Wool Secretariat.
All in all, this position seriously sug-
gests that the merino ban has had little
worthwhile purpose abroad. Whether it
is helping woolgrowing at home could
also be a moot point. The latest drive
to sell corriedale stud sheep to Commu-
nist countries certainly appears to put
a new slant on the old problem of stud
sheep exports which the Australian
Government' can hardly avoid.
Sir William Gunn’s Quests
From the golden fleece to wheat
7T!he new tack of Sir William Gunn be-
■*" came very clear when he joined
Treasurer Harold Holt in New York to
address Jhe seminar on Australia
arranged by the Chase Manhattan Bank.
He spoke on the need for a world grains
plan, and the tariffs on wool and meat
which are harmful to Australia.
He made a solid impact, as might be
imagined. He fits the image of the real
Australian —the man of the outback, the
lanky stockman getting a little thick
around the middle, perhaps, but still up
to throwing a steer and riding a horse.
Sir William can wear the big hat and the
elastic-side boots without making it look
like an act.
As for his remarks about grains, the
cynic might say that he wouldn’t know
the difference between Algeribee and
Hickory King. That doesn't matter.
It was policies he was talking about,
the over-riding problem of surpluses in
some countries and starvation in others.
This is something which Americans (who
have the biggest surpluses) frequently dis-
cuss amongst themselves, even though
they don’t know what to do about it.
Grains are a subject which Sir- William
has not touched on before. For a first
time effort it was pretty good. It was a
politician’s speech. That’s where it was
different.
He told the seminar that the grains
problem was one of distribution, not
a shortage of markets. There was no
room for policies aimed at controlling the
production of foodstuffs, he said. “There
are millions of starving people in the
world, including those immediately north
of Australia. Those people must be fed
if Communism is to be defeated, or even
contained.”
An international pool, he said, should
be set up for surplus grain and, if neces-
sary, some of it could be given away. He
did not say how this might all come
about, but suggested that an international
conference would be a good start. It
would, too.
Gunn, in New York, was swimming in
a pretty big pond, yet one suspects that
he would impress Americans as a man
who can get things done. If you were
looking for a man to head up a world
conference on the grains problem, Gunn
wouldn’t be a bad choice at all. He has
tremendous energy and enthusiasm, and
cannot help standing out in a crowd.
If he relies heavily on public relations,
who doesn’t these days? In any case,
this cuts both ways. Gunn is tailor-made
for public relations. He’s a natural. The
copy writes itself. There are plenty of
men around who, with all the PR there
is, cannot get their image across, simply
because they haven’t got one to project.
A few weeks back this writer predicted
that Gunn was up to something new and
something pretty big. The question now
is which seat, in Queensland, he contests?
On the other hand, this same writer
predicted that, despite all our endeavors,
the US market for beef and veal would
remain difficult. That prediction still
stands.
Just the same, if anyone might be able
to hit it off personally with Lyndon B.
Johnson, then, again, Sir William Gunn
would be the man. Both are from genu-
ine pioneer stock. Johnson is from Texas
and Gunn from a part of Queensland

which is remarkably similar to Texas.
There’s even a town not far from Goon-
diwindi (Gunn's stamping ground) called
Texas, presumably because it reminded
someone years ago of the Texas in the
USA.
As far as meat is concerned, though,
at its entry into the US, the correct sum-
ming-up at the New York seminar came
from Chase Manhattan vice-president,
William F. Butler, who said: “The politi-
cal balance of power is such that farm
subsidies and restrictions will have an
extremely low mortality rate.” The meat
difficulty is more one of restrictions than
tariffs; it is State legislation (pretty
phoney) which is the urgent problem
right now. If someone could get to
Johnson, and get him on side, he just
might be able to do something about it.
With wool the 25} p.c. duty is the
killer. It comes up for renewal this
year, so Gunn's talk was pertinent from
the American viewpoint as well as our
own. If it is going to be dropped, or
reduced, now is the time.
There may be a slight chance, because
the US sheep industry is run-down, in-
efficient, and has nothing like the politi-
cal pull of the US beef industry.
Gunn flew to New York straight after
the Australian Wool Industry Conference
in Canberra, which was a tremendous
personal victory for him. Before he left,
he issued a short statement on wool re-
search which will result in plenty of
questions coming his way when he gets
back.
Where this statement dealt with dwind-
ling funds for research it was typically
straight from the shoulder. Last year
the funds stood at £6.9 million, this year
at £5.4 million, and next year would be
down to £3.5 million. By 1967 they
would be at a dangerously low level.
Then the statement referred, in a
rather vague way (for Gunn), to the
CSIRO, the universities and the State
Departments of Agriculture. Now the
CSIRO, particularly, is an Australian
sacred cow. It's held in very high regard
by the Commonwealth Government.
Is Sir William Gunn implying that he,
and the Wool Board, are of the opinion
that the CSIRO, the universities and
the State Departments are not pulling
their weight in wool research? If so, he
would find plenty of woolgrowers agree-
ing with him.
Then, however, his friends in Can-
berra would be shaking a warning finger.
You don't get votes by blasting the
CSIRO.
This business of the dwindling research
funds and the possibility that woolgrower
deductions for the reserve price plan
might exceed 3 p.c. (part to pay for
research) are developing into yet another
wool industry set-to. If the individual
woolgrower’s deduction from his wool
clip is too high, then, obviously, his
enthusiasm for the reserve price plan will
weaken. The break-even point is pro-
bably around 5 p.c. Below five and
reserve price will probably win at the
referendum. Above 5 p.c. it could lose.
Holding Malthus at Bay
A sheep that produces litters
"CVery time our old friend Malthus
looks like having his theory proved
correct, something comes along tq hold
his ghost at bay. Discovery of the
Americas and, later, farm mechanisat'on
gave mankind temporary respite from
the fear of population outstripping food
supply.
Currently, Malthus is with us again.
The “population explosion” is something
everyone has heard about. The new
“developing” nations are not developing
at all quickly enough; the old nations are
finding that giving food away is not as
easy as it sounds. We will probably
make out all right, even though some
human being dies of hunger somewhere
in the world every few minutes.
Yet any move, in any direction, which
gives promise of lifting food production
to a marked extent is noteworthy. The
Colbred venture in Britain at the moment
has all the indications of being a major
breakthrough.
The Colbred is a sheep.
It's not yet a fully developed breed.
When it is, it may have the remarkable
quality of being able to have two “litters”
of four or more lambs a year.
A sheep having litters is remarkable
enough. Naturally this is the thing that
will have popular appeal to the layman.
It can be easily imagined what a pro-
found effect such a sheep could have on
the production of mutton and lamb.
It is not much use producing litters,
though, if the resulting lamb and mutton
is of poor quality. There is already a
sheep in existence, a native breed in Fin-
land, which has litters.
The Colbred, eventually, may be pro-
ducing litters of predictable carcass
quality and growth rate.
At first, Colbreds were almost worth
their weight in gold. Thirty were sold in
1962 to the English subsidiary of Bre-
warrana Pastoral Co. Pty Ltd, the Nar-
randera (NSW) enterprise headed by
South Australian “wool knight” Sir
Ellerton Becker. The price: £20,000.
The Colbreds were the brainwave of a
Cotswold farmer, Oscar Colburn. He
developed them by the time-tested
method of animal breeding: knowing
what he wanted and determination to get
it.
Last year his flock of 500 ewes were
producing two lambs each. “Twinning”
in sheep is not all that remarkable. Many
.merino men in Australia have a pro-
portion of their ewes dropping twins
regularly. With the Colbreds this is a
stabilised percentage and now it is pro-
posed to introduce the “litter” element
through the Finnish Landrace and the
French He de France sheep.
