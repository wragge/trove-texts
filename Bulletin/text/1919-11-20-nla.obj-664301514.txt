Don t suppose that you must give biblio-
graphical references to all the literature of

which the interested reader can get on its

P on ’t toil to put your best foot forward
Otherwise you won’t have a chance to use
the other foot. Note the construction of the
news story in any first-class paper. It. is
built up on the same logical system as the
symphony or'opera. The opening paragraph
gives in succinct fashion the main point oi:
interest, the gist of the story, just as the
first movement or overture of a musical com-
position expresses the theme or motif.
Don’t expect the editor to explain why he
objects to your manuscript. He is probably
right in his verdict, but if you make him
five a reason for it he will have to inven ;
one and it would probably be wrong.
Don’t say you can’t find anything to write
about. Chesterton says: “There are no un-
interesting subjects; there are only unin-
terested people.”
Don’t regurgitate undigested morsels. It
is a disgusting habit.
Don’t refer to notes or books while writ-
ing. Read up on the subject as thoroughly
as you can, and take as many notes as you
need; then put away all your notes and
books out of reach, and next day, or at least
an hour later, lay clean sheets of paper on a
clear 'desk and write out what you know
about it, in your own way. Afterwards, pre-
ferably next day, read over your manuscript
critically, verify your facts, correct your
data, revise your English and add any essen-
tial facts, but don’t expect the reader to be
interested in what is so uninteresting to you
that you cannot keep it in mind a single
hour.
Don’t define a hard word by a harder word.
Vladivostoek is a hard word, but when the
war correspondent arrives at Yladivostock
he goes right on inland without stopping to
explain that “this is-a city south of Khaba-
rovks and east of Tsitsikhar.” So you, if
you want to say “calorie.” say it; but don’t
make it worse by “explaining” it as “the
quantity of heat necessary to effect a rise of
temperature of one degree centigrade of a
cube of water each dimension of which is
one-tenth part of the length of a bar of plati-
num and iridium alloy lying in the observa-
tory of St. Cloud, if it has not been smashed
up by a shell from Big Bertha.” If you
think you must define the calorie say casu-
ally tliat 100 calories of energy can be de-
rived from four lumps of sugar or from a
one-inch cube of butter, or explain that a
man needs to expend a hundred calories an
hour to keep his body running and 160
calories if he is working, hard.
Don’t think you must leave 'out all tech-
nical terms. Use them whenever necessary
without apology, and if possible without for-
mal definition. People are not so easily
scared by strange words as you may think.
They rather like ’em. Kipling is read with
delight by old and young, yet his prose and
verse are crammed with technical terms.
Having exhausted the military, nautical and
mechailical vocabularies he invented a new
and unknown nomenclature for his story
“With the Night Mail.” In his ‘‘Just So”
stories for the kiddies he sticks in long names
like plums in a pudding. A Ivipling diction-
ary has been published, but even the editor
could not run down all the peculiar words
Kipling' had picked up. But the ordinary
reader does not need the dictionary. He gets
the meaning from the fun of the story, for
the story is so written that he will get the
meaning. Observe that the war eorrespon-.
dent writes without hesitation: “At zero
hour the barrage was raised and the poilu
and the doughboy sprang over the top, stick-
ing their bayonets into the Boclie.” And
the .man in the street reads it without bat-
ting an eye, although the sentence contains
half a dozen words not to be found in his
vocabulary five years ago or in the diction-
ary yet. But if this sentence was being
written by one of our conscientious scien-
tists he would word it in this fashion: “At
zero hour, to use the military term for the
time set for the beginning of an offensive, the
barrage (that is to say the line on which the
artillery-fire is directed) was raised and the
poilu, which is a French slang term for sol-
dier, meaning ‘hairy,’ and corresponding to
the American ‘roughneck’ and the dough-
boy—this is an American slang term for
infantryman, derived either from the round
buttons worn in the Civil War or the ‘dobe
huts’ inhabited in the Mexican War, or the
pipe-clayed belts of the Revolutionary War
—sprang over the top, or surmounted the
parapet of the entrenchments, sticking their
bayonets—invented, by the way, at Bayonne,
in France, in 1650 —into the Boche, a con-
temptuous term referring to the Germans
an abbreviation probably of caboche, or
block-head, originally applied to Alsatians.”
EDWIN E. SLOSSEN.
An Old Irish Book
Charles Lever posed most of the time as
a sort of Irresponsible; still he had serious
moments, and he put some of them into
Davenport Dunn, a hi? volume written in
the days when novelists gave good measure.
This forgotten tome, still found occasionally
among the second-hand stock, throws a sori
of light on Irish affairs, as showing the in-
curable tendency of the official Englishman,
especially in the stuffy early-Victorian days,
when philanthropy became a sort of cult,
to Be Good to people. Rake-hellism had
grown wearisome, so it became the custom
to give afternoon tea to the exhausted horse,
and to send mustard-plasters to small nig-
gers in Africa, and to see that the elephant
at the Zoo had sufficient chops for brea..
fast.
One device of the time was to supply Ire-
land with new landlords. The old ones were
an embarrassed lot. Everybody in the upper
circles became embarrassed in the song and
dice and dance and' wine days of the Re-
gency and Geo. IV., but English landlords
recuperated out of the coal and iron boom
while Ireland lacked these things. Still
the difficulties of Lord Scatterbrain of
Tumbledown Castle in the parish of Bally-
ruin were an affair between himself and his
creditors. He was in the main an easy-going
Franco-Norman person, whose family had
become purely Irish in the course of time,
and never dreamt of being anything else.
He was too poor at the moment to do much
for his tenantry (it was the English legend
that a landlord should be rich so that he
could do heaps for his tenantry even if he
really spent his money on Flossies in Lon-
don) ; but on the other hand the tenants did
little for him. England got the idea that
what Ireland required was hard, practical,
rich, stirring, efficient landlords who would
wake the place up, and it passed an Encum-
bered Estates Act, which Lever describes in
Davenport Dunn. The badly encumbered
estates were foreclosed by the Government
and sold. They sold for a song because there
was too much estate on the market, so Lord
Scatterbrain faded off the landscape of Bally-
rum. They weren’t bought by other local
Scattei brains, for these men lacked ready
cash, or if they had it they didn’t want to
occupy their old friends’ houses and evict
their old friends’ womenfolk. But English
speculators bought for the sake of a promis-
ing investment, and for the dignity of being
landed magnates, and because they didn’t
want to leave their cotton factories and soap-
b oil eries they sent over efficient agents and
became themselves very efficient absentees.
1 hat is to say, they were efficient at rent-
collecting if at little else. The joyous doings
ot the Encumbered Estates Court are only
an episode in Lever’s pld book, but they are
an interesting episode.
Australian Literary Tendencies
Australians, evolving an accent, are doubt-
less evolving a literary style, a word-ex-
pression of their manner of thought. Signs
indicate a French clearness and compact-
ness, without the limitations of that vocabu-
lary A typical Briton may say a hundred
words in a sentence, and, naturally, he writes
that way. Not so the typical Aussie—his
arc landscapes in outline; bright lights, dark
shadows and absence of British fogs and
mists. He inclines to clear seeing, think-
ing and expression, losing the verbiage of
slow thought. He employs, naturally, the
short word, sentence and paragraph; the
minimum of qualifying wordsabundant
punctuation, with the free use of hyphen and
brackets—these last aiding to more faithfully
reproduce “conversational” thought. Ail
prose literature worth while is what the
writer might have said if relating his mat-
ter by tongue—not some jargon of combina-
tions only used with the pen. For living

After Dinner Pill
Most people eat too much. If
you are a hearty eater help your di-
gestion and take care of the over-
load, by taking one Pinkette, the
little sugar coated laxative pill after
a big dinner.
Pinkettes, the new laxative, are
greatly superior to old fashioned
medicines which over stimulate the
liver and, when their use is stopped,
leave it more torpid than before.
Pinkettes do not upset the stomach
or cause griping.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Sestina.
I made myself a shadowed singing place
Where trees, whose sombre boughs bore ashen
flowers,
Made leafy twilight of the gold noonday.
No color’d flower was there to paint the light
With passion, no red rose to vex my heart
With ghosts of vain regrets and dead desire.
No laughing shouts of joy or hot desire
Woke sounding echoes in that shadowed
place,
But a low murmuring music made my heart
Contented with green glooms and pallid
flowers,
And such faint joy and languorous delight
As men may know who know not golden day.
Softly I sang soft songs by night and day.
Lulling to sleep those ghosts of old desire —
Sorrow, great joy and amorous delight
That walked amongst the shadows of that
place;
Or sometimes plucked the pale funereal
flowers
Ready to deck the grave of my sick heart.
There I forgot the sorrows of my heart,
The winds, the clouds that flecked the blue-
gold day;
Forgot the birds, the trees, the brighter
flowers,
Forgot the bitter-sweet of past desire;
Despair, ambition, hope had here no place,
And only faint remembrance of delight.
One day you came with all your wondrous
light
Of Autumn hair. No longer was my heart
Content to dwell within this dim-lit place,
For with you came the glory of the day,
And with you came again the old desire
For song and laughter and for brighter
flowers.
O lady, lady, queen of living flowers,
Strayed from the very garden of delight,
Your coming woke the slumbering desire
And lit the torch of love within my heart.
How shall I, having seen the splendid day,
Dwell longer in the darkness of this place?
Lady, my place is silent; all the flowers
Are -withered, since that day you brought the
light;
But all my heart is singing with desire.

Bridges.
Over the glittering waters I fashioned a
bridge of winder,
Builded with untold labor, stable and
broad and strong;
All that a man might vision of beauty the
heavens under,
I gathered at heart, and shaped to a rap-
turous bridge of song.
■>l
Spanning the faithless torrent, I moulded its
arch untiring,
Dreaming thus men should journey to the
light of a fuller day;
Massive, with masoned pillars, it mocked at
the wave’s aspiring.
But the waters in storm rose shrieking,
and lo! it was swept away.
All that a man might vision—ah, blind! fo*
a girl came singing,
Looping a pansy cadence in the twist of a
merry dream ;
In place of my chiselled thought, a garland
of fancy flinging
Whereon men strode in triumph high over
the roaring stream.

Man.
A pigmy, blinded with the black of ignorance;
Uttering vapid howls, and noisily disputing
The march of the inevitable.
A fool, crowmed with a wisp of straw,
Railing at heedless time
And mouthing senseless curses
At the patient wisdom of the gods.

Heaven.
There may be happier regions
Than those we know to-day.
Where angels dance in legions,
And hearts are ever gay;
And I shall lind this bliss-world.
If such fair realms there be,
When I have done with this world,
And it has done with me.
No golden harp or halo.
Or shoulder-sprouting wings
Or long night-garments pale (Oh.
Why should I want such things 1)
I ask for in my heaven,
If ever I get there,
But peace from six or seven
Dull hundredweights of care.
The earth has many troubles:
Hotels now close at six ;
I never win on doubles ;
And I am in a fix
Because to meet my owing
Is not an easy task —
Peace from such troubles growing
Is all the heaven I ask.
There may be some such pasture '
That I in time shall know,
Some place that bids you cast your
Eternal weight of woe;
And I shall go on browsing
On Peace, in mansions blest —
Where wowsers do no wowsing.
The wicked are at rest.

In our constant effort to obtain maximum machine shop production we are at times apt to overlook the auxiliaries
and to concentrate our attention on the strictly productive portion of the plant, to the prejudice of the remainder which
is really just as important. . ’
There-are many links in the production scheme; it is advisable to go over them all periodically so as to make sure
that each is fully equal to its duty.
The Lumsden Oscillating Tool Grinder is a highly efficient auxiliary if used intelligently With it lathe planer
shaper and slotter tools with correct cutting and clearance angles can be made at the lowest possible’ labor’ cost ’
Without it these tools must still be made, but cost a great deal more.

“Life is just one picnic after another, these days,”
said somebody. If that is so then such things as
"Rex” Camp Pie
and the other “Rex” goods cannot be overlooked.
“REX” Camp Pie makes up into excellent Sand-
wiches. It can also be packed into the Picnic
Hamper, opened up on the spot and served to your
guests—an inviting meat delicacy that is always
relished.
“Rex” Camp Pie is made from the choicest com-

An Essex Appreciation:-
Armidale,
29th October, 1919.
Messrs. Dalgety & Co., Ltd.
Dear Sirs,
You will be interested to learn that I am
more than pleased with my “Essex” Car, now that I
have ha<J an opportunity to test the capabilities of
this fine machine, having just completed a run from
Newcastle to Armidale in a little under 10 hours, with
an average of over 22 miles to the gallon on petrol,
and with regard to lubricating oil it surprised me, for
I only put a pint in at Murrurrundi, and can safely say
that this “Essex” is exceptionally light on oil.
With regard to speed, she’s slick on hills,
although I took no unreasonable chances with a new
car, but I’m satisfied to meet anything in this class
up to 20 h.p. on the road.
Already quite a number of admirers of this
machine have expressed their opinion that there’s a
good future for the “Essex,” notwithstanding the fact
of many other makes now on the Australian market.
You are to be congratulated in acquiring the
Agency for N.S.W. with the “Essex,” a name worthy
in association with the famous Hudson Super Six.
Yours faithfully,
(Signed J. H. PLEACE.

ABOLITION OF LYING AT
ELECTIONS.
“The voice of the people is the voice of a god.’’—
Hackneyed, saying that was never any good to any-
body.
“You can fool all the people some of the time and
you can fool some of the people all the time, but
you can’t fool all the people all the time.” —Platitude
ascribed to Abraham Lincoln.
Up to date the people—the majority—have
made or attempted to make, at one time and
place or another, every mistake that it is
possible to make, and when more mistakes
are invented they will be made also.
Generally the people have done this because
their gods told them to, for the voice of the
people comes out of the thick end of the
trumpet because the god blows into the thin
end. The mass of the community have
approved of the persecution of Catholics,
Protestants, Jews, Quakers and everybody
else. In certain Mohammedan countries it
is hardly possible to keep them from slaying
all kinds of Christians, not because their
rulers want them to do so, for the rulers
are now badly scared of consequences, but
because popular opinion created in other
times tends that way. The vast mass of
public opinion in Germany supported the
most horrible war in modern history, and
even if it was a carefully-regulated and
drilled public opinion—an officially canned and
bottled public opinion —that was insufficient
excuse. Public opinion in early New Eng-
land supported one of the most horrible sys-
tems of persecution that the world has
known, and Pilgrim Father opinion was more
genuinely public than that even of an in-
tensely democratic country like Australia,
tor the communities were so small that tlfe
individual elector could make his voice
heard directly on big questions instead of
having to speak through his representative,
lhe same popular voice was heard at its
tuilest development in the affairs of New
Australia-in-Paraguay, and it wrecked that
1 aradise, founded under the most favorable
auspices, in a few months. The majoritv,
because of its profound faith in its gods—
who are gods because they reluctantly admit
that they are gods—isn’t the kind of dupe
that has the virtue of not making the same
mistake twice. Its education being too much
or the rule-of-thumb sort which consists in
knowing the date of the battle of Hastings,
a plausible person can produce, as his own
perfectly new an d god-like inspiration, an
idea that has been tried and has failed 100
times already, and is being tried with disas-
tious results in 100 places now. and can find
followers profit and great advertisement out
oi it. Of that class of delusion is the
eternal gLag of the note-issue with no rnetal-
or very little such security,
behind it, but is endorsed otherwise by “the
entire public and private assets of the com-
munity. Countries which have this policy
in a bad form to-day include Columbia (paper

ments are glaring lies within the knowledge

and understand the daily happenings and
retentive enough to recall them; but the
general assumption appears to be that tlm
community, 0 r enough of it to decide an
election, has neither brains nor memory.

is far less grotesque and far less an inter
ference with popular liberty than the old-
womamsh, busy-bodyish device of requiring
political newspaper articles published during
or-VoV 0 ’ 1 u!- me t( > he signed. That filled no
tt reat public need, for the paper was already
civilhc and criminally responsible, but there
was a certain satisfaction in knowing the
author and possibly being nasty to him and
his wife and his mother-in-law. On the
other hand the Court of Swift Jurisdiction
would fill a great void. It is a thousand
times more important to stop the circula-
tion of the lie than to find out that Jones
was the hack or agent who wrote the lie—
possibly because lie would have lost his job
e he refused. The wholesale circulation
ot political lies leads nations to ruin, crime
and downfall, all in order that a few base
job-hunters may enjoy some brief notoriety
and salary. It is a dispensing of poison to
infants, for an excited crowd is a large
composite infant. And as politics become
more and more a wholesale lying competition,
men with consciences grow weary of them
aad them more and more to liars,
When Smith becomes the political god of
a large .class because he makes more eensa,
tional promises, and brings mere sensational
charges against everybody opposed to him,
than were, ever made or imagined before, he
is a good leader fop a pogrom but not for
a people. Yet If votes can only bo won
ba j , b ®J n g a more sensational black,
guard than Smith, all save very strenuous
people are apt to let the matter go by default.
THE DISCREDITED “REGULAR.”
A cable stated a few days ago that Admiral
Percy Scott, in his new book on the Navy,
"severely condemns the civilian element in
the service.” Regular soldiers also con-
demned the civilian element in the Army
when the war began; and many of them hav-i
been condemning it ever since. Yet if there
is one fact which emerges clearly from the
proceedings of the past five years it is that
t\ie average professional' fighting-man, on
shore or afloat, was a tragic ass devoid of
vision, a poor judge of men, a century or
more out of date in his disciplinary methods,
and often lacking expert knowledge of the
elements of his own job. Many of the lead-
ing sailors and soldiers are tneir own most
destructive critics. Scott, in his new book,
writing of the British fleet at Jutland, said
hysterically: "All our guns were outranged,
our equipment was inferior, and ice hadn't
o aog s chance .” There is a picture of him-
selt and Admiral Jellicoe at peaceful
Scapa Flow parting for the night which
would have been regarded as a painful case
01 I ? s ® . of morale if it had occurred amongst
ex-civilians in a front-line trench in France
S° US T to a h ? p '^ v , er - “When I said ‘Good
night, I added, Shall we be here in the
morning?- and Jellicoe laconically replied,

had been prepared for by regulars—

In Admiral Scott’s opinion "battleships
are now dead owing to their vulnerability
tiom aircraft and submarines.” On the

limes the other day: “Have a big prepon-
derance of speed over your enemy....the

Incomparable had I remained at the
,T h ® building of the Hood
(41,200 tons displacement and eight 15-
mchers) seems to show that the prepon-
derance of naval opinion is with the sen-
tuagenanan expert. Yet he has his critics,
;\ n( J * ier admiral describes his articles as “a
fhif Ue aad disjointed tirade, reminiscent of
the passionate screams of an angry child.”
* * * _
A row of a similar kind has been raging
amongst the leaders of the British Army for
years. Did General Smitii-Dorbien lose his
nerve during the great retreat on Paris?
Has he victimised by Lord French? Who
was to blame for the shell-shortage in 1015 •
£2™* both Lord Kitchener and Lord
1 bench agree for some time that h.e. shells
were useless? Such questions, mixed up
™,„S alesale accusations of incompetence
amounting to semi-idiocy, have been debated
reely in circles where field-marshals con-
| rega | e ‘ v * n last few weeks Colonel
has been court-martialled for
nhnnffb Wh , at *?&*** to be the truth
about the bungling of the Kussian campaign.
Kitchener, after a lifetime spent in estima-
ting soldiers, expressed the opinion that the
Anzacs would not stand up to the lighting
in 1 landers. And that the Indians would”
l rom Suvla to the rout of the sth Army in
1018 practically all the great disasters
The U Xlllp« nder the^ gis of “regular” leaders,
f. Allies won in the end because, providen-
tially, regulars ’ were also in charge in the
f el m U ln countries. Bloch, a civilian, had
told the Germans exactly what would happen
tbeir next attack on France, whether it
was by Belgium or the Vosges—that siege
wurfare wouid develop, and that shrapnel
would become almost useless. The Ger-
mans happened to have h.e. shells and heavy

Turn from the militarists to the civilians.
Jj ° r . tul \ hal f tae war, on many fronts, the
doe ms had to fight the soldiers on behalf
of the army s welfare. The Mesopotamia
scandal is a case in point. An RA W C
major named Carter was the first to protest
against the villainous transport arrange-
duni, 18 Kut cam Paign. General
Cowper makes this admission, in the official
report: I threatened to put him under
arrest, and I said I would get his hospital
ship taken away from him for a meddlesome,
interfering faddist.” In France, in the course
of time, the doctors earned the right to a
practically free hand. The old soldiers pro-
tested against the “d—d molly-coddling”
which characteristed the new rdgime—prac-
tices that had not been followed in the Afri-
can wars, much less in the Crimea. But
tb ey could do no more than protest. And
the death-rate from sickness in the field fell
to about the normal level in civilian life.
Elsewhere than in the field the medical men
continued to be hampered in the exercise of
their work by the combatant section. Thus

A.M.C. administrators, to send away men
who were so old or so unfit physically that
they were never able to see the firing-
line, It helped to keep the Home Service
fires burning, blit it cost the taxpayers a
vast sum of money, Every strictly civilian
war-job was done well. The vets, brought
down the old horse-wastage figures on trans-
ports by almost as much per cent, as the
doctors brought down the mortality figures
for typhoid and dysentery, The dentists
gave thousands real health, in some cases
foi? the first time in their patients’ lives, The
Red Cross and the Comforts Fund peonk
knew their business. The propaganda work
was amazingly successful. And all through
the war civilians invented things—new guns
tanks, bombs of all sorts, ’planes of even’
description—and the militarists had to be
literally kicked into giving them a trial. The
Australian De Mole’s tank alone might to
quote London Daily News, “have ended
the war in 1917” ; but the designs were never
even considered.
* * * ,
Most of the world is ousting those of its
old-school militarists and “regulars” who
either proved failures in the field or
never so much as got there. One of
the few exceptions is Australia. The Com-
monwealth is. hanging on to its Von
Klucics and its ’longshore Tirpitzes as if
they were valuable assets. The young men
who have made good in the war, the genuine
experts with fresh and vigorous minds, are
being shelved, if only because there is no
room for them. There is no place in the
national stable for an Artilleryman or a
Cetigne; every stall contains an elderly or
spavined cart-horse. Ex-civilians who rose
to high rank on active service—men such as
Colonel Murray, V.C.—are barred alto-
gether. They can get into the backwater
afforded by the Reserve, or they can get out.
Ex-C.M.F. officers and other ranks may go
back to the C.M.F. if they like —with the
rank they held when they left. That is to
say, an A.I.F. colonel might rejoin the
militia as a corporal. Similarly with the
Permanent soldier who did brilliantly over-
seas. There are men in our Permanent
Forces to-day who left five years ago as
n.c.o.’s, who rose to field rank abroad, and
who are serving once more as corporals, in
some cases under officers who were returned
as inefficients. If the typical “regular”
had not proved himself so narrow-minded and
dull, in the Australian Army as in every
other, the anomaly would be less glaring;
and if there were not thousands of provedly
competent youngsters available the calamity
would look smaller. It would likewise be
diminished if the other nations had not re-
cently revised the old theory that almost any
ass is intelligent enough to hold a commis-
sion.
THE RUINS OF RYAN.
Premier Theodore has succeeded to the
State crown of Queensland which Ryan
dropped when he fled over the border to
escape the monsters he had created, the first
State Minister who, while wanting Federal
position, didn’t dare to ask his own people
for it. Sitting amidst the Ruins of Ryan,
Theodore isn’t a cheering spectacle. Ilis
recently-fled chief is stumping the South
with garish tales about the riches and all-
round prosperity he left behind him, and
deputations of unemployed are dropping in
on Theodore to ask for some of these bless-
ings. To which the new Premier is driven
to reply in effect that the old Premier was
and is a brazen blatherskite and sham, for
after four years of his rule there is nothing
to distribute. The matter came to a show-
down when certain persons, claiming to re-
present 6000 unemployed, demanded work,
with a living wage attached, and the new
Premier had to reply that, owing to the three
huge complete deficits and the bank overdraft
which Ryan had left on his hands and the
enormous shortage which Ryan had left in a
partially completed state, there was simply no
money with which to meet the demand, and
vtry little credit. It was the reply that even
the stupendous bluffer Ryan would have had
to make if he hadn’t skedaddled from the
scene of disaster, leaving: Theodore to make
it instead. And if Ryan had been so
foolish. as to stand for a Queensland elec-
torate it is the sort of answer he would have
to make every time he came to meet his
h ederal constituents, for his State sins
would rise against him in his Federal
capacity, however much he tried to keep his
two capacities apart.
* * * *
Queensland, now the Ruins of Ryan, is no
mean State. In fact, it ought to be the
marvel of the Commonwealth and one of
the wonders of the world. It is the biggest
State, if account is taken only of the land
with an average rainfall of 15in. per year or
more, which is the land that counts. Of
this sort of soil it has 491,999 square miles,
while the next-best State, Westralia, has
only --9,452 square miles, or less than half,
and the Territory only 243,860 square miles,
which is also less than half. In fact.
Queensland has almost as much well-watered
country as all the other States put together,
and its valuable area is in one block, easily
reached by railroads, while Westralia is
three bits of good soil with desert in
between. In Volume II of the Federal
Statistics there appeared a list of Austra-
lian rivers covering 164 closely-printed
columns, and eleven (11) of these columns
were devoted to Queensland. It is the
supreme cattle and sugar State, and has
the biggest share of the possibilities that
Australia possesses in the way of cotton
and other tropical produce. It ranks third
(immediately after N. S. Wales and West-
ralia) in the value of its mineral produc-
tion, . and .it has more mineral production
per inhabitant in most years than even
lx. S. Wales. It has more public land leased
and bringing in rental, as distinct from pub-
lie land that is desert and only brings in
sorrow, than any other State—more than
N. S. Wales, Victoria, S. Aus. and Tas-
mania combined. And, though it stands for
about 16 per cent, of the area of the Com-
monwealth, it owns 40 per cent, of the
forests. It is Australia’s paradise—-the land
of blessings. The disaster is that, by some
accident or other, Queensland has an enor-
mously undue proportion of people imported
trom or the sons and daughters of people
imported from—countries where the popula-
tion never developed any capacity for Par-
liamentary self-government on their own
account. Their lack of development might
be because thev were constructed to be serfs
and driven cattle, like the Turks and the Prus-
sian. Or it might be because an overwhelm-
ing _ power deprived them of their oppor-
tunity in the days wdien more fortunate
people were learning democratic methods of

mains that in the United States, Canada and
some parts of Australia a very powerful
and restless and politically-backward crowd,
with imported feudal grievances, imported
traditions of insurrection and violence, but
with no record worth mentioning of success-
ful Parliamentary government on their own
account, has arisen to teach in a patronising
fashion the people who have some sort oi

selves haven't caught up.

Ryan represents a race whose ill-luck it
was that never in all history had it a Par-
liament of its own, though it has seen a
Legislature of foreigners sitting in Dublin,
a . n d it has supplied members to Legislatures
sitting in London, Washington, Ottawa,
bantiago-in-Chile and in all the Australasian
capitals and elsewhere. In its own country
the nearest approach to self-government it
was ever permitted was a riot, an insurrec-
tion or a chance shot at somebody. It has
produced notable statesmen in spite of its
terrible disadvantages; also, it has naturally
produced Ryans. Ryan being what he is,
the political undesirables of course gather
round him, regarding him, rightly or wrongly,
as the _ partially-tamed or thinly-disguised
-Bolshevik. As to his fitness to lead a people
with real traditions of self-government, there
is no doubt at all—he has none. His record
in Queensland is that of the comic-opera
revolutionist or the moonlighter of melo-
drama. It took him just four years to con-
y ert the most glorious State of Australasia
into the Ruins of Ryan, with a paralysing
railway deficit, an overdraft of like character,
the worst record for strikes and unemployed
m the Commonwealth, almost the worst re-
cord for borrowing and the very worst record
for the increase in the cost of living. Ilis
last effort was an attempt to supersede Par-
liamentary Government by the establishment
of a nominee Board, largely himself or his
successor, with power to order anybody who
employed anybody to do anything it pleased
with a view, or alleged view, to reducing
unemployment. Now that lie has fled his
less impudent or arrogant successor, sitting
like Job among the debris of Scripture, is
moved to tell a deputation of the numerous
unemployed that the great bubble of smoke
and skite has burst and he can do nothing.
Even in South Australia, the State which
has neither coal, iron, silver nor gold, and
not too much well-watered country, the Pre-
mier is able to do something and isn’t a pat-
riarch of Uz lamenting in the dust. Yet
with all his failure Ryan is a force to be
reckoned with. His vitality is that of the
other prize fat man—Count Fosco in “The
Woman in White.” Using his stomach- as
a ram, he breaks through difficulties in a
marvellous fashion, and though he left his
State looking like a marine store in difficul-
ties, he has all the airs of a conqueror. Poor
Theodore, left behind like a sort of Cin-
derella, to answer the door when the
creditors call, has no airs at all. Gold-
smith’s “Deserted Village” wasn’t a sadder
spectacle.

THE PEOPLE’S “DAY OF POWER.”
Every three years or so the phrase—the in-
vention of a cynical political humorist —is
given an airing by the two big parties of the
day. The idea is to delude the plain citizen
into thinking that he is not the futile cipher
which even the dullest man now and then
suspects himself to be. A proportion of the
people—about one in five —“fall for the
bluff,” as the Yankees have it, at each elec-
tion, and go to the polls with the naif illu-
sion that they will put everything straight
by the right exercise of their franchise. The
day passes. The victorious party is warmly
acclaimed and proceeds to headquarters with
its commission to save the country. A flood
of rebuke, argument, expletive and recrimina-
tion is let loose, which lasts, off and on, bar
accidents, for another three years. But
nothing in particular happens. If the will
of the sovereign people is expressed in effec-
tive legislation to the extent of 2 per cent.,
the democracy is fortunate. In no sphere is
this phenomenon so marked as it is in
the National Parliament, which is to be dealt
with by its alleged masters next month.
* * * *
The first item in which the parties, both
Federal and State, deny the electors the use
of any intelligence they may have is in
respect of the selection of candidates. The
West Sydney Laborites may or may not
have wanted T. J. Ryan ; but the Machine
decided that they must have him, and that
was all about it. The Nationalist Executive
wields the bludgeon rather more consider-
ately. Say that Brown, the sitting mem-
ber, has a record of indiscipline—that he
has criticised the party leaders and proved
recalcitrant in important divisions. It is
considered wise, in the party interests, to
replace him by Smith. The party papers
begin by mentioning that Smith has been
•‘approached” by leaders of thought in
Brown’s constituency. It is represented
that Smith has removed himself to some
quiet spot where he may consider the propo-
sition in a reverent spirit from all angles.
Brown, having seen unreliable party men
butchered in this manner before, proclaims
that he will not abide by the local or any
other selection—a particularly justifiable
attitude in the present Federal struggle, see-
ing that preferential voting has been intro-
duced. He is rebuked. “Abolition of
selection,” his leaders tell him, “is the ideal.
But, unfortunately, it is impossible of
realisation. It means a dissipation of party
strength. Besides, the Labor party won’t
agree to it.” Smith is selected. The party
label is affixed to him. Brown goes to
almost certain ruin as an Independent. The
elector’s omnipotence is here limited to
supporting Smith or the Laborite, or to
throwing away his vote on Brown. The
vote may be said to be wasted even if the
33 to one chance comes off and the rebel
wins. For under the party system such a
representative can achieve nothing construc-
tive : unless he is a man of extraordinary
capacity he merely stands for a permanent
howl of protest against things in general.
A chief issue of the present election is the
repression of the profiteering which, along
with lavish borrowing and devaluated money,
is responsible for the raised cost of living.
If there is one direction more than another
in which the people would exercise their
power if they had it on December 13 next,
it is unquestionably in getting prices back to
somewhere near their pre-war level. But so
far, at any rate, as Federal action against
profiteering is concerned, the elector looks
like being impotent for a good many years to
come. It is again a matter of Party Govern-
ment. Both parties are agreed, and so are
all lawyers, that unless the existing Consti-
tution is altered the xlustralian Parliament
can do nothing to about 95 per cent, of such
profiteers as the Commonwealth possesses. In
other words, to that vast majority whose pro-
fiteering is confined to one State. What a
National Government is capable of doing in
the way of bringing down prices is being
demonstrated by the Government of unified
Britain at this moment. The Profiteering
Act had hardly arrived before prices began
to fall in the United Kingdom. According
to London Daily Mail (23/9/’l9) :
The 12-guinea suit of six months ago is now
marked at 8 guineas.
Women’s clothes are cheaper.
Some restaurants and cafes are amending their
menus. Vegetables which a few weeks ago cost 6d.
are priced at 4d.
On the whole there is a decline in fish and fruit
prices.
Furniture, crockery, pianos and wall-papers arc
beginning to show reductions.
If the Constitutional amendments for which
the Hughes Government is asking were car-
ried, it would be possible for the Federal
Parliament immediately to place a valid
Profiteering Act on the Australian Statute
Book. But because the Hughes party wants
some such legislation, the Ryan party
doesn’t. It would be demonstrably bad party
business for the Ryanites if the other side
were to get the credit of bringing the price
of, say, “the workers’ pants,” which were
held up to special notice by Labor’s new
leader in Sydney the other night, from £4
down to £2 13s. 4d. The feat might suggest
that W. M. Codlin was the friend and not
T. J. Siiokt. Accordingly, as his “day of
power” approaches, the elector has the ex-
traordinary spectacle of the Labor party op-
posing the removal from the Constitution of
the Trade and Commerce Clause, and all the
other features against which Labor has been
fulminating for the past 15 years. Since
on this issue the profiteer may be relied on
to vote the same ticket as Labor, the ordin-
ary citizen’s prospects of bringing down
prices by the use of his power at the ballot-
box appear slim. At every turn the elector
finds himself hit similarly by the party sys-
tem. Because Ryan makes a bluffing offer
of £25,000,000 cash to the soldiers, Hughes
has to commit the puissant elector to more
or less the same bargain. The average elec-
tor may believe in the Defence system which
did so much to make the A.I.F. what it was.
But because a considerable number of young
men of voting age are sick of soldiering,
the Hughes party has exempted them from
further training for life. The Ryanites
have raised this bet substantially. They are
offering to wipe out military training alto-
gether. The elector cannot interfere, to any
real purpose, jn all this insanity, either on
his “day of power” or at any other time.
He is as potent as a private soldier was to
influence strategy during the war.
What is the cure —granted, of course,
that it is desirable for the electors to have
genuine power instead of a mockery of it;
that the main end of government is the
fulfilment of the electors’ wishes, and not
a system under which two opposing hordes
of politicians exhaust their energies fight-
ing for office? The introduction of the
Initiative Referendum seems the likeliest, if
not the only, way out. Assume that a cer-
tain percentage of electors considered that
compulsory military training should be con-
tinued, regardless of the Party aspect of
the problem; or that a Profiteering Act
should be brought into the realm of prac-
tical politics, unloaded by any Party
issue. This section could petition for, and
get, a referendum on the question at any
time: and if it was carried Parliament
would be required to make it law. It would
be all to the good if the raising of the Party
issue, in the press or elsewhere, between
the nresentation of the petition and the date
of the returns, were made an offence under
the Electoral Act. It is only by some de-
vice of the sort that the bulk of the electors
will ever find real self-expression. At
present the ordinary voter is so much in
bondage to _ the two b’g Party machines by
the time his bogus “day of power” arrives
that he finds it hardly worth his while to
vote —and more than half of him acts
accordingly.

PLAIN ENGLISH.
Back to the Geebung Epoch.
At a dinner given to the Governor of N. S.
Wales last week W. A. Holman said:—
The idea that a State Governor is a mere social
light, the idea that he is not a man weighted down
with heavy responsibilities, and with the continuous
task of choosing whether he should accept or reject
suggestions made to him —that idea, I say, is one
that should be abandoned.
The statement suggests that the Premier of
N. S. Wales doesn’t know the first principles
of his own job. Theoretically, the King may
still disband the army, dismiss all his officers,
sell all naval stores and so forth. In reality
he can. do nothing. The whole responsibility
for actions of the sort rests on his Ministers,
who decide upon them at meetings which the
King is debarred from even attending. The
wisdom of the convention is evident. What
British Sovereign, desirous of holding his
crown, would take upon himself the respon-
sibility of imposing conscription on a nation,
as was done by an Order in Council in Eng-
land during the Great War? Or of refusing
to impose it if the people, through their repre-
sentatives, demanded it? In the very early
days of Australian history the Governor was
a military dictator pure and simple. When
Responsible Government arrived he degener-
ated into a sort of bear-leader: one whose
business it was to direct the uncouth settlers
along the path of civilised government. Long
after the Royal prerogative had been trans-
ferred to the Cabinet in the United Kingdom.
State Governors in Australia clung to the
right to veto legislation, to dismiss Ministers,
to dissolve Parliament at will and to refuse
to dissolve Parliament although asked to do
so by the Government of the day. But the
Chelmsford row in Queensland and subse-
quent disturbances in Tasmania and S. Aus-
tralia, all of them due to State Governors
reaching after powers which were felt by the
people to be opposed to commonsense, as well
as to the spirit of the age, resulted in the
present accepted position, which is that the
Governor of an Australian State has no more
power than the Sovereign who appoints him.
Actually he is the identical thing which Hol-
man says he is not: he is “a mere social
light,” a figurehead, one who launches ships
and opens public buildings. He has no more
right to interfere in the building of the Act
to which he must subsequently give his
assent than he has to change the design of
the battleship which he may eventually
launch. His not to reason why on such
duties, but simply to struggle along as best
he can on the £5OOO a year (with perks)
which he is paid for doing them.
An Echo of Armistice Day.
The cant of machine-made patriotism grows
more and more wearisome. While the war
lasted and we were in danger nothing was
too good for “the boys.” Everyone in uni-
form was a hero—the Home Service special-
ists, the people at Le Havre, and the infan-
trymen in the front line alike. Young fel-
lows were heroes who only threatened to go
to the war, or who said they would go if
they could manage it. Girls expressed in
song a wish to “hug and kiss” the Digger
when he came home again. The Digger is
back, only to find that the kaleidoscope has
taken a fresh turn. People call him a
“pest” who. once, with equal exaggeration,
spoke of him as a demigod. The song-
stresses want none of him, as a general thing.
He has in many cases to “dip his badge”
in order to get a job. While he wanders
about the streets seeking to be “repatriated,”
Cheer-up Huts —resorts which were never so
much wanted as they are now —are going out
of business. So are most of the Comforts
Funds and so on. About the only people
who still take a genuine interest in the Dig-
ger, as such, are the publicans. The vice-
regalities, politicians and lady-organisers who
protested loudest about their debt to him
have switched on to a new objective.
They are concentrating on the 60,000 who
are dead. The dead don’t need such hack-
neyed tributes. They live in the memories
of those who knew them, and few of them
would have asked for more. But all of them
would certainly have desired that the coun-
try should wholeheartedly combine to help
and understand their mates who had the
luck to get home. In this respect the feel-
ings of the dead are not considered. There
is no easy advertisement in it. Only some
hard work, some self-sacrifice, even some
“social” unpopularity. It is so much “safer”
to take under your patronage the dead who
can ask for nothing, and who never make
you feel uncomfortable by getting drunk and
riotous.
The Federal Railways.
Last financial year (to June 30) the three
Commonwealth railways didn’t quite pay
working expenses, so that interest on loan
money was a total loss. In this respect they
were in the same skiff with 15 N. S. Wales
State railways big and small. The Federal
railway shortage was £499,302 and was at the
rate of £313 per mile on the North-to-South
transcontinental line; £272 per mile on the
East-to-West line ; and £lB3 per mile on the
Dryberra Federal capital line. The North-
to-South line has this explanation to offer —
it isn’t complete and- hasn’t yet got any-
where, there being still a big gap in the
centre. For the present it is really two
lines, one suspended at the little town of
Oodnadatta, and the other hung up at the
Katherine River, which isn’t even a townlet.
Two lines in a trance at places like these
haven’t the same opportunities as a finished
railway to Australia’s biggest which
field has the capital of the biggest State
behind it, or as a steel highway to the capital
of the continent, where the loan money of
the continent is being spent. The future of
the North-to-South railway is still before it,
and the results are not bad by comparison.
It is the custom to speak of the Federal
railways as shocking examples. But as the
completion of the two necessary defence
lines across the continent —the lines which
have to traverse the desert to reach better
regions beyond—was left to the Federal
authority, it was bound to have some awful
examples on its hands for a while. Yet
N. S. Wales can show bad cases also, without
a shadow of the same excuse; and the Ma
State system is a rock of solvency compared
with that of Queensland. Against the Fed-
eral record of 1735 miles of railway which
lost £499,302 last year (rather under £2BB
per mile), N. S. Wales can show 2853 miles
of completed line which lost £672.457 (say
£235 per mile). And there were extra-
ordinary instances among these 2853 miles
of derelects, some even quite close to Sydney
—cases where the loss (excess of working ex-
penses and interest over takings) for the year
ran to £1035, £lOBO. £1229, £1746 and £2020
per mile. The loss per mile on the Blacktown-
Richmond railway, which starts only 21
miles from Sydney, is 24 times greater than
that which the Commonwealth makes in
humping goods and passengers on its road
from Darwin to a mere railhead, and that in
a tropical place which is called in scorn a
White Elephant, and which was allegedly
passed on a trusting community by base
sharks in Adelaide. (The fact that a gift
of 523,620 square miles of pretty good land
was thrown in is frequently ignored.) Yet
the amazing Blacktown-Richmond crock has
been working for 55 years. Again,
the line from Goulburn to Nimmita-
bel, which passes through Queanbeyan,
four miles from Canberra, loses almost
as much money as the Northern Ter-
ritory line (handed over, as already men-
tioned, with an endowment of 523,020 acres
attached), though it is 48 miles shorter. For
its size it is the worse loser. The Federal
Government had bestowed on it the big
desert jobs to which State enterprise wasn’t
equal. It had to build partly with a view
to defence, it being the first Government
which had the defence of Australia on its
hands, and defence isn’t supposed to pay
dividends. On the other side, the States
built Solely for profit. When the Common-
wealth took up its contract it had freely
given to it the right to the traffic between
Port Augusta as the starting-off place and
Ivalgoorlie and Darwin as the termini, but
not the goodwill of the business between
Melbourne or Adelaide and Port Augusta or
between Kalgoorlie and Perth. That is to
say, the States have a Big City trade which
they can tax to make up or cover up the
losses on their outlying enterprises. The
Commonwealth has none but outlying enter-
prises. Pending development, the Big City
termini on its .1735 miles of road are such
places as Kalgoorlie (population 13,448;.
Augusta (1261), Darwin (a thousand or
so). Oodnadatta (187), Katherine River (not
known at last census) and Canberra (116
at last census). In the circumstances the
Federal Government looks a fairly good rail-
way manager, though what it will be if
Ryan should come to the head of affairs is
another matter. He found the Queensland
railway system more than paying its way,
yet when he fled out of the country after
four years it was losing at the rate of £260
per mile per annum—the whole of it, not
a little more than half, as in N. S. Wales.

An Issue Which Does Not Hook Like
Getting a Fair Run.
There may never again be such a chance to
alter Australia’s admittedly defective Consti-
tution as will present itself on December 18
next. Never, certainly, while the party
system remains. No political vicissitude of
the war period was stranger than that
W. M. Hughes should emerge as leader of
the Conservatives in Australia. Almost liis
only qualification was a negative one : he is
no pacifist. But in this respect he has not
gone to the Tories: they have come to him.
He was fighting for what they then con-
demned as the “un-English doctrine of con-
scription” a dozen years ago. In matters
of social reform, and in his opposition to
injurious trusts, he still stands where he did
when he wrote “The Case for Labor.” He
has been able to impose an essentially work-
ing-class will on the class which is repre-
sented in Trades Hall circles as “bat-
tening” ; so the Conservative party is
officially supporting the Constitutional
changes which it has hitherto opposed.
The Laborites have always been in
favor of them. Naturally ' so; for not
a single democratic measure of any real
value in the category of Trade and Com-
merce can be put on the Australian Statute
Book under existing conditions. Witness
the fate of the Trade Marks Act, the Aus-
tralian Industries Preservation Act, and
many other measures which failed to get
past the High Court. The chances of the
States doing much for the toiler are slim:
their High Courts are their Legislative
Councils, and they habitually treat ad-
vanced legislation as the N. S. Wales
M’s.L.C. recently treated the Children’s
Maintenance Bill. Assuming that Labor
gives as solid an affirmative vote on the
Referendum issues next month as it has
done on substantially the same issues in the
past, and assuming that a mere 25 per cent, of
“Nationalists” vote their leader’s ticket, then
victory is certain. Victory, of course, would
be certain if the issues were handled on
their merits. But it does not appear likely
that they will be. The followers of T. j.
Ryan are being ordered to turn them down
because they represent “camouflage.” It
is, perhaps, as good an objection as Labor’s
new leader can lodge in the circumstances.
He could hardly say: “I am afraid if
Hughes gets these powers he may do some-
thing with them to better your lot. If so,
it would injure my ultimate chances of get-
ting ottice. Therefore vote No.” W. A.
Holman, for the N. S. Wales State
Righters, intends to oppose unless he gets
an assurance that the Federal Parliament
will at once be moved to Canberra. The*
profiteers are bound to vote No. And there'
are a few Nationalists of the type repre-
sented by ex-M.H.R. Quick (he recently
stated his intention to vote No because the
Government might have attacked the high-
price curse under the War-time Profits Act
and didn’t), who, for one reason or another,
will vote the ticket they have always voted.
But most Nationalists should, after all, fol-
low the party. Defeat, if it comes, will be
due to the workers. In other words, the
Labor Samson will pull the temple of im-
proved conditions about his ears on the off-
chance that his new friend, Ryan, may some
day extract Office from the ruins. It is a
mad situation.

Manufactures. It is shocking. Mr. Fkaseb
says that during the last four years he has
been able to buy in Australia for less than
lie could import almost all the things which
were needed to carry on the railways of the
ot:ite. “When the war had been in pro-
gress nearly two years he made a contract
for the supply of rails for N. S. Wales at
considerably less than half the quotations
for foreign productions. The Department
had been forced to manufacture its own
axles in its own shops, and these were at
least equal to the best from abroad. Almost
everything required for building locomotives
could be made in Australia within a short
period.” Doubtless in making these asser-
tions Mr. Fraser was endeavoring to show
that, with Protection, which operated auto-
matically during the war, Australian brain
and brawn could do without the importer.
Phis, sir, is a heresy, which I am surprised
to find having public utterance and astoun-
ded and grieved to see securing publication
in our reputable daily press. To promul-
gate such ideas is to court widespread dis-
aster. Are. not our importers the wealthiest
and .most influential members of the com-
munity? Without them it is improbable
that we should have such great cities as
grace our seaboard, and we should certainly
not witness the magnificent stream of ready-
to-use commodities flowing into the country,
permitting the people to devote themselves
to work for which they are fitted. As a
patriotic citizen of the Empire, I do not
assert for a moment that Australians are
incapable of unloading ocean carriers, and
I admit that it is not necessary to import
labor to perform this task. Indeed, it is
clear that the physique of the Australian
marks him out as the proper person to drag
heavy things about. His sporting instinct
and proclivities, too, suggest that he will be
happily, as well as usefully, employed in
running down the rabbit. This numerous
and valuable asset, I will remind Mr.
Fraser in passing, was originally imported
from. the Old Country. It has, of course,
deteriorated.; nevertheless, cooked with
bacon, it is still edible. It is, perhaps,
economically justifiable that we should pro-
duce the coarse staples of our food supply,
but, thank Heaven, having no Mr. Fraser
to poke in a meddlesome finger, we still re-
tain enough sense of the fitness of things to
send Home our wool to be returned in the
shape of material suitable for the wear of
a gentleman.—lours (indignantly), A. Free-
dumper.

One Abdul and Another.
“Henry Horsecollar” draws a parallel:—
The N. S. Wales State Premier is one of a group
of three, the others being the late Nicholas of Rus-
sia and the mor e or less dubiously-late Abdul-Hamid
of Turkey. But the overwhelming resemblance is
between Abdul-Hamid and Abdul-Holman. • I leave
cut of course the former’s gross ignorance (he was
a product of the harem), his gross cruelty (he was
a Turk), and the grosser part of his wooden-
headedness (he came of a race with no art, no
science, no literature, no invention barring lies,
no mechanical aptitude and a scanty language).
Yet the political outlook of the two men is (or
was) the same. In their shifts, devices, evasions
and postponements, and in their blank inability
to realise that their subjects should be equal, and
their blank inability to realise that they had
any such inability, there is nothing to choose be-
tween Abdul-Ham and Abdul-Hol.
Nothing could convince Hamid that an Armenian
had the same religious and political claims as a
Moslem. Nothing will persuade Holman that a
N. S. Wales subject who lives in the commercial
radius of, say, Twofold Bay or Grafton has a
right to the same railway and city and harbor
advantages as one who lives within the commercial
radius of Sydney. Abdul-llamid making impas-
sioned statements about his desire to confer reli-
gious equality all round and then starting a fresh
massacre is an earlier edition of Abdul-Holman
almost bursting in his eagerness for decentralisa-
tion, yet never letting any new port have a rail-
way westward to bring to it the trade of its
inland country, and never connecting his North
Coast line with the Queensland system lest trade
should find a cheaper outlet at Brisbane. Hamid,
looting his subjects to keep up the bloated glories
of the Yildiz Kiosk at Constantinople, and Hol-
man, looting the people of the North with heavy
taxes to pay losses on hopeless drought railways
built in the Central West because the centre natu-
rally attaches to Sydney, are brothers. Hamid, at
Constantinople, renewing his broken promise for the
thousandth time and marvelling that people doubted
the august, impeccable, improbable, incoherent un-
decipherable red herring that he drew across the
track, was duplicated at Kyogle by Holman telling
the people that he was perishing of sudden im-
patience to give them their Brisbane connection,
and quite unable to understand that his unfinished
Murwillumbah-Brisbane line alongside, being a
broken promise of many years’ standing, made his
attitude a bad joke. Abdul-Hamid handing out
occasional paper concessions under pressure but with
a beaming smile wasn’t so widely apart from
Abdul-Holman giving the North Coast an unbal-
lasted railway that runs parallel with the shore,
and so brings no trade worth mentioning to any
northern port; also, some decayed and cast-off
rolling-stock, and a time-table and schedule of rates
fixed up by his Pashas in Sydney and purely in
Sydney interests. The Turk dodging a liability
wasn’t more agile than the N. S. Waler taking
a railway round in a wide scmi-circle to dodge
Port Stephens.
The Abduls were both adepts at keeping the
tenth part of a promise in the letter and breaking
all ten parts in the spirit. There was never a
more splendid example of thick-headed effrontery
than Abdul-Hamjd's declaration in 1909, just be-
fore his fall, that he had proved himself a liberal
and constitutional monarch by giving his subjects
a bogus Parliament in 1876 —and shortly after-
wards chasing the members away with objurgations
and threats of sudden death. But so far as his
chances allowed Abdul-Holman reproduced this in-
cident in 1919 when he proved the sincerity of
his decentralisation pose by pleading that in 1914,
after four years’ delay, his Government had finished
11 miles of railway begun by McGowen to connect
a N. S. Wales branch line—or, rather, a branch
of a branch —with a Victorian branch line, and
had been so mad with themselves for doing it that
the experiment was never repeated!
Nicholas the Czar, granting a Parliament and
then taking away all its important powers by
ukase, was a pale reflection of Abdul-Hamid and
Abdul-Holman. The attitude of all three was (and
is) that they were willing to concede everything
except concessions, to give anything save what
was wanted, and to decentralise the authority or
the railways or anything else provided the old cen-
tralisation was maintained.
+
From a student of naval tactics: —
Simultaneously with the appearance of Jellicoe’s
report there appeared a cable message from another
eminent naval authority, Lord Fisher, who made
the succinct observation that the defence of
Australia could be best served by squadrons of sub-
marines. The fact we have to face is that Aus-
WELCOME TO WHAT WAS LEFT.
PROFITEER: “ That's enough, my boy —you may have the rest."
THE B OY: “But there's nothing left, sir.”
PROFITEER: “Nothing left! Why, damme, there's the lottle, isn't there?”
tralia and Maoriland hold the only British peoples
to whom Pacific defence is vital; and in the end it
is upon them that naval preparations in the Pacific
must rest. Yet even if by dint of sacrifice we
raised a considerable force of capital ships, these
could not gain for us command of our seas. In the
event of conflict with any Power possessing indubi-
tably weightier forces than ourselves, our capital
ships must inevitably become a harbor fleet, just as
the powerful German Navy became the Kiel Canal
fleet when opposed by the British Navy. Further,
in the ultimate issue Australia relies for her defence
upon the naval strength of the Empire. Her primary
object then is to maintain such forces in Australian
waters as would discourage attack, or in the event
of attack would harry and weaken the enemy. For
both these purposes the submarine is the ideal
weapon. If the naval experience of the war has
taught us anything it is that, while the submarine
may not give command of the sea, it does render a
fleet of capital ships useless as an attacking force.
The presence of a few hostile submarines compelled
the withdrawal of the Queen Elizabeth and the bulk
of the Allied naval forces from the Dardanelles, and
when it is remembered that 10 submarines can be
built and maintained for the same cost as one capi-
tal ship it would seem that Lord Fisher's contention
is at least very worthy of consideration.
Bit by bit Adelaide’s splendid park-lands
are being fenced off by clubs that charge
for their use. And Adelaide doesn't ltno.v
what to do about it. Open park-lands are
valuable, it knows, but bowls and tennis
and other things can’t be played on spaces
that horses and cows pervade; and people
won’t fence in portions to keep out the
cows and lay down turf, etc., unless they
are given some exclusive rights. The aver-
age elector can see arguments on both sides,
and when the matter is referred to him he
mostly stays home. The other day two
slices were wanted—one by the Tennis
Association and one by the University Oval
—and only a vote in every 10 on the roll
was cast. The Labor party, as a rule, yells
“No,” but this is always on the ground that
the land will be enclosed for the benefit of
the privileged few. And that is perfectly
true —just as a job on the wharves or any-
where else is reserved for the privileged few,
the few who will pay union fees. The
unionist says (quite rightly), “That’s proper.
Why should a man get the benefit of his
fellow-worker’s contributions? The union-
ist has paid up and improved conditions, and
those improved conditions ought to be for
him,” The public interest is best safe-
guarded in each case by a proviso that the
outsider shall be allowed in on certain
terms. For instance, in Maoriland, at any
rate, whenever a particular employment, like
a part of a park, is fenced off for a certain
union, the Court fixes the entrance money
and subscription, or at least says it shall
not be above a certain sum. The man who
demands preference for unionists but isn't
prepared to concede preferential right to a
bit of public lands —under conditions—has
run out of logic.
The new Labor leaders are going strong
on the stoppage of things, for it is no small
achievement to have closed the country’s
one transcontinental railway; also the
mining-field which stood for one-fifth of ail
the mineral production (coal included) of
the Commonwealth; likewise to have shut
up or chased away the Government of one-
sixth of the Commonwealth. But it is as
slow as ever about starting things. If ever
it wants its big Sydney daily paper (the
one that was postponed till after the war,
but seems as helplessly bogged after the war
as before) it wants it now to carry the party
to victory at the Federal election. Yet,
though the money was put up, and the build-
ing was put up, and the staff was put up,
the literary fly in the gluepot doesn’t move,
and Labor leaves the daily campaigning
business to the “capitalistic” press. The new
generation of Labor leaders talk much about
the multitude of ready-made industries they
are going to “take over” and manage with
staggering success. If they would only start
one industry (not weekly papers supported
by union subscriptions, or meat-shops sup-
plied with meat commandeered at a low price
from private owners, but an ordinary sort
of industry) and show good results, it would
be worth many thousands of votes. Perhaps
they don’t want votes.
The condensed doctrine of Ryan and Co.:
Inasmuch as Australia has lost 60,000 capable
workers (called “six-bob-a-day murderers’’) by death,
and has 40,000 more lost in an industrial sense but
requiring support, while the number of ordinary
dependants hasn’t diminished ;
And work is in arrear through 300,000 or so able-
bodied men being away for several years;
And there are £400,000,000 or so of war debts to
wipe off;
Therefore we should do less work than usual and
strike oftener. •
A Melbourne weekly describes Ryan as
“the hope of Australian democracy.” A for-
loan hope, then.
Hughes complains that he isn’t the
Almighty, that he is misreported, that the
Returned Soldiers’ League isn’t as affable
as it might be, that the Farmers’ Fiuon
doesn’t play the game, and so on. Evidently
he still believes in the motto he took to the
Cold Country: “Wails Forever Best.”
. don’t these Labor politicians who
inveigh against titles act up to their con-
victions occasionally? Ryan can’t address a
meeting without billing himself, or being
billed, as “The Honorable T. J. Ryan” ; and
the Prime Minister (who is “still a Labor
man, thank God!”) must be the “Right
Hon.”
The. yarn that State Governors are a
necessary link between “the Crown” and the
people got another clout last week. “The
Crown” wanted to communicate with the
people; so it sent a message to the G.-G., and
the G.-G. passed it on. Apparently “the
Crown,” instead of regarding the State vice-
regals as a necessity, considers them merely
a nuisance.
The Vic. Protestant Assoc, is asking all
Protestant working-people to vote anti-
Labor in the Federal elections. “This,” says
the Executive naively, “is our great oppor-
tunity.” _ It certainly uoes look like an
opportunity for the clerics who batten on
sectarianism to get publicity and do a bit of
good for themselves. But the religions
question hasn’t the most fragmentary prac-
tical bearing on Commonwealth no
And why, anyhow, a worker who wouldn’t
vote against Ryan on his horrible record in
Queensland should do it because iuaim v
has said he will vote Labor is a riddle that
none but the ostentatiously righteous mind
can answer.
Ward, M.P., returned after a year in
Russia, told the House of Commons that one
of his most vivid impressions of Petrograd
was the constant throwing of dead bodies
out of windows. There was no inquest and
no medical certificate —merely a long drop
and the bouncing of the cadavers on the
blocks. Afterwards they were collected in
a sort of way and thrown down wells. The
Bolshevik Government, whose virt”' s are
extolled in Australia by Considine, 1.11. R.,
has dispensed with a lot of red tape.
Thus the wildly-optimistic Sydney Tele-
graph, in the midst of the drought, borrow-
ing to the last: —•
The war loaded our 5,000,000 people with a dead
financial burden of £400,000,000 involving an interest
charge of £20,000,000 a year. This amount of
money, had it been spent with the slightest modicum
of judgment on developmental works, would have
increased the productiveness of the Commonwealth
enormously. It would have earned directly either
the whole or a great part of its interest, and in-
directly very much more.
As a matter of fact £400,000,000 worth more
loan works built with sor per cent, money
wouldn’t necessarily pay even a cent to-
wards the interest bill. The Telegraph’s
own favored Ma State has 480 miles of rail-
way which don’t earn a penny of interest
and don’t even earn working expenses, and
2372 miles which earn working expenses but
only a trifle towards interest. A million
spent on war may cost £50,000 a year. The
same amount borrowed at 5 per cent, and
invested in an affair like the Blaektown-
Richmond railway would cost the country
about £130,000 a year. There are plenty
of public works that are less reproductive
than a war. In fact, a country might lose
a war and pay an indemnity on cheaper
terms than are involved in some of Aus-
tralia’s permanent and reproductive loan
jobs.
“I hope the Government will lose no time
in coming to our assistance” is the wail of
the broken farmer and ruined pastoralist
writing to the Sydney Freetrade papers
from all over N. S. Wales. But, thanks to
the Freetrade policy that many of these
men have followed on the promise (never
kept) of cheap imported machinery, the
Government can't. It ought to be able to
tax the comfortably-off and drought-proof
makers of cotton goods, linens, silks,
woollens, jute goods (including cornsacks),
carpets, rugs, floorcloths, linoleums, vel-
veteens, sewing cotton (which Coats in
Britain makes 40 per cent, dividends out
of), cream separators, gas-engines, electri-
cal machinery, tin-plates, barbed-wire, print-
ing paper (the imported article has gone up
about 400 per cent.), matches and hundreds
of other things. A small extra tax on these
people, scattered in all the eastern manu-
facturing towns from the Tweed to the
Snowy River, would do wonders; but these
people don’t exist here. The great bulk of
our manufacturers are in Europe or
America, paying taxes to other Govern-
ments. The importing policy teaches that
the man on the land—the “primary in-
dustry” man—should be the big dog and
the artisan class the very small tail. And
when the dog cries to the tail for assistance
there isn’t enough tail.

Would

NO- It wouldn’t be fair.
Ami yet some people expect the youthful Australian
Iron and Steel Industry to compete on even terms
against the giant enterprises of Europe and America.
When the Australian Industry is full-grown it will
be able to stand up against the competition of the
world—on equal terms, or anything like equal terms,
it fears no competitor.
But at present the terms are not equal. The Aus-
tralian Industry is young and is heavily handicapped
—is paying high wages—heavy transport charges—
high prices for materials —and it has only a com-
paratively small output.
The Australian Iron and Steel Industry wants to
be allowed to work its hardest for the people and
for the future of Australia.
It wants to help build Australia into a great nation
—to make Australia self-reliant and self-supporting
—to make Australia safe from attack from without
—to make plenty of employment for Australian
citizens.
EVERY ENGINEER IN AUSTRALIA
is asked to assist to build up this Industry by using nothing but
AUSTRALIAN IRON AND
which has been proved equal to that made in any part of the world.

The Coats sewing cotton company in Britain
(capital £10,000,000) made £3,899,388 profit
last year after paying the War Profits Tax
(it runs as high as 80 per cent.) and other
imposts and war wmges—this compared with
a mere £2,903,239 in 1913, when there was
no War Profits Tax. Australia contributed
to the co.’s 40 per cent, dividend and to J.
Bull’s revenue and to British war wages by
paying about four times as much as usual
for its cotton. If it had made its own cotton
the War Profits and other things would have
gone into its own revenue, and it could have
regulated prices. Being too busy building
election railways it couldn’t spare the labor
to make cotton. Now one State alone is
voting £1,000,000 to help the people it pot
on the land, and things are only middling—-
except the price of imported sewing cotton,
which is worse 'than damnable.
State Frights and a desperate struggle for
advertisement have between them landed
N. S. Wales in a pretty mess. On the
second outbreak of ’flu in Sydney (informa-
tion about the first was suppressed) the
Government, allegedly acting on the advice
of a medical board whose identity was never
disclosed, shut up pubs and ordered masks
to be worn, and fined numerous people who
didn’t obey. _ One Bung took the matter
up to the High Court; and the High Court
unanimously decided that the appellant
needn’t go further than the first point he
raised. Now 7 it’s merely a question of as-
sessing compensation and damages for about
10,000 illegal acts done by this blundering
Government.
W. M. Hughes needs a six months’ rest.
Mainly because he has a larger opinion of
himself than of anybody else, the little man
insists upon personally handling a thousand
things that ought to be left to others, and
the fag comes out in his speeches. And
especially in his repartee. Once, if riiordant,
it was mostly brilliant; now for the greater
part it is merely offensive —as, for instance,
when a man in Adelaide asked him a quite
legitimate but awkward question and was
answered with “Die dowm, Bolshevik, lie
dowm !” It wouldn’t matter much if it was
only Hughes’s tongue that has grown duller;
it is the dulling of the brain behind the
tongue that is serious. Our rotten system
of government is to blame—the system
under wffiich the Prime Minister is respon-
sible for every other Minister’s sins, and one
man’s failure is liable to mean the defeat
of the whole crowd and the arrival of men
of whom three-fourths are less capable than
the old lot.
Labor-leader Tudor’s “pledge” might have
said less and meant a great deal more. He
pledges his party to grant the people pow'er
to make or unmake any law. either by the
initiative or indirectly through the Com-
monwealth Parliament; and to immediately
revise the tariff. The people already have
power to make or repeal such laws as the
Constitution allows them to handle, and
they also have power to alter the Constitu-
tion. As for “revising” the tariff, Tudor
doesn’t state in what direction. The importers
would like to revise the tariff, too, but it is
doubtful whether they would grant much
protection to Australian industries. And,
anyhow, does Tudor remember a Labor
leader who, in Melbourne Town Hall, in
September, 1914, promised a Protective tariff
and the “initiative and Referendum” in the
first session of the new Parliament? Does
he remember who was Minister for Customs
in the new Parliament and how the promise
was kept?
Joseph Cook spoke a dispirited piece about
the Canberra capital the other day. He
didn’t say it was a desirable place, but no
one ever does. And when he said that the
fixing of the metropolis in N. S. Wales was
“a bargain between the States” —which
sounded like an old clo’ transaction in a
pawnshop—he didn’t allege that it was an
honest or respectable bargain. But he
warned his hearers against any proposal to
obliterate the present States and replace
them by smaller ones because
If the States were abolished, then all contracts
made between the States would necessarily be abol-
ished also, and away goes the Federal capital pro-
ject into thin air so far as we in N. S. Wales are
concerned. .. .The question would be re-opened and
left open for the people of Australia to determine.
So Joseph, the maladroit, is solid on two
things—that “the people of Australia”
didn’t choose Canberra, and that if the ques-
tion was “left open for the people of Aus-
tralia to determine” they wouldn’t have, the
wonderful Capital in Two Pieces at a gift.
The Argus opens its columns to people
who are furious with the authorities re-
sponsible for the appearance of a poster over
the Swanston-street entrance to the
Flinders-street station, appealing to the
passer-by to buy Australian-made goods. It

Department to encourage any such foolish-

ness, it seems. The Argus, being partially
an Australian product, can never be an
entirely self-satisfied paper. If it were not
that so much of its material and so many
of its ideas are imported it would commit
hari-kari as a thing made in Australia and
unfit to live.
The Nationalist attempt to lure the Labor
vote for its Senate three is baited by Walter
Duncan, an ex-president of the N. S. Wales
* Clerks’ Union and a son-in-law of Riley.
M.H.R. for South Sydney. Duncan has
been a prominent man in union politics
during the last decade, but the idea that
he will pull many unionist votes is a delu-
sion. The split between him and the
Laborites occurred long before any real
breakage happened in union circles; and
when he is produced as exhibit “A” to
show' that the Nationalists are as represen-
tative of Labor as of any other party, some
of the old troubles in which Dlincan figured
may be recalled.

Not for years have the Vic. Legislative
Assembly green benches been so full as they
were when shots were exchanged between
ex-Premier Peacock and Treasurer McPher-
son. It was the sequel to an attack made
by the Finance Minister on S’ralick the
night befoi’e at Gaud Mayor Aikman’s feast.
McPherson there represented himself as the
financial saviour of the country, one who
produced big surpluses, while Peacock had
piled up a deficit of £1,200,000, tried to put
on a super-income-tax, and had raised rail-
way freights. In the proper manner of the
duello Peacock notified McPherson that he
would day him on the door of the House.
His main contention was that, though the
increase in railway freights was wicked,
McPherson had retained half of it, and that
the Lawson-McPherson coalition had sug-
gested no alternative to the super-tax to
liquidate the big deticit which was incurred
to “keep things moving” in the tirst year of
the war. McPherson retorted that he took
back nothing, stood by his figures, and had
attacked a policy and not an individual.
Lawson, who felt he was between the Devil
and the deep sea—as indeed he was, for he
was Peacock’s first-lieutenant in 1914-17
kept discreetly silent. So did the Liberals,
who passed the super-tax and allowed the
Fat House to throw it out.

candidate for Melbourne, took the lead as
a reformer at one bound the other day.
Asked if he would favor the abolition of
railway fares and freights he replied: “Like
a bird!” He didn’t require a moment’s
thought before chucking £24,000,000 of State
revenue overboard, and the wild-haired little
irresponsible would probably have chucked
the other £25,000,000 just as joyfully if any-
one had suggested it. In the new struggle to
buy votes with promises some little desperado
may yet give away Australia with a packet
of tea because the local wiseacre at Pumpkin
Flat won’t support him otherwise,
N.S.W. Lands Department replies that
the Chinese are not a serious factor in the
banana industry of N.S.W. Northern Rivers.
The returned Digger knows better. Not
only has Ah Sweat himself got control of a
considerable area, but the greedy white land-
holder, following the usual practice, has
rushed up the rent of land to the Chinese.
This has established a standard, of course;
in other words, landowners who are not dis-
posed to let their acres to Chinese neverthe-
less demand from returned Diggers and other
white men rents equal to what their neigh-
bors have been able to squeeze from Ah
Sweat. For a seven-acre plantation a five-
year lease was offered for £1250 cash, plus
£5 per acre per annum ; that is to say, £4O
per acre per annum is demanded for this
area. Had the Chinese not come into the
district to sweat themselves and be sweated,
such a price would never have been thought
of.
Frank Anstey, whirling along as usual,
regardless of anything but the cheers he is
pursuing, describes the referendum as “a
sham, a mockery and a waste of money.”
And what was it when it was taken by the
Labor party, of which both Anstey and
Hughes were then members? Ah, then it
was the thin end of the wedge that was to
let in the Millennium! Never in all the
world was there a more dishonest thing
than Party Government. Under its blight
it becomes the duty of Anstey to curse to-
day what he blessed yesterday; and, poor
slave, if he didn’t do it he would have to
get work.
Edward Cotter, Labor M.L.A. for Rich-
mond (Vic.), whose party has done so much
on the platform to foster the Australian
spirit of self-reliance, and so little in Par-
liament, has been asking the Vic. Govern-
ment to establish a bunch of new industries
to employ “the hundreds of engineers and
mechanics being turned out of the University
and technical schools every year” and for
the benefit of returned soldiers. He means
well, no doubt, but he would cut a much
more convincing figure as an industrial up-
lifter if, for instance, the Richmond Muni-
cipal Council, which contains a majority ot
Labor reps., insisted on emphatic preference
for Australian-made goods in placing its
orders for municipal supplies.
Nationalism had poor luck in getting a
candidate to Oppose Edmund Jowett _ for
Grampians (Vic.). According to Jowett
himself, the National Federation had received
only one entry when nominations for its pre-
selection ballot were supposed to have been
closed; and that candidate decided to back
out after a survey of the prospects. A little
later the Federation announced that it had
endorsed the candidature of barrister Rus-
sell Coldham. Coldham has already had ex-
perience of the apathy of electors, and he has
since advised the National campaign coun-
cil that he is not going on. Hughes, dodging
unexpectedly around corners and throwing
up geysers of embarrassing vapor, is a diffi-
cult political boss to follow, especially by
one with Coldham’s dignified idea of what is
the proper thing.
After nomination day
One hundred and eighty-one persons are nominated
for the Keps., and 51 others will struggle for the
18 vacancies in the Senate. Many of the aspirants
say they are journalists; many more are laborers,
graziers and storekeepers; two of them are women
(Mary H. McMahon, of N. S. Wales, for the Senate;
and Mary Grant, for Kooyong, Vic.). Only one,
John Thomson, for Cowper (N.S.W.), has “no
occupation.” Matthews (Melbourne Ports) kni
David Watkins (Newcastle) have been returned un-
opposed, whereas the unhappy Jens Jensen is one
of six who seek to represent Bass (Tas.). Lister,
Bamford, Fowler, Boyd and Lamond are old stagers
who are mostly glad to have three opponents, and
there are also four scampering for Hume (lately
vacated by Falkiner), among whom may be dis-
cerned the old Indi ex-Representative, Parker
Moloney. Bruce Smith, who declined to be ear-
marked by a pre-selection ballot, is the one case of
an old Ministerialist standing as an Independent,
while it is significant that two of Hughes’s strongest
critics, Fowler and Boyd, are being challenged by
“Independent” Nationalists in addition to Laborites.
Drake-Btoekman (for the Senate) is a picturesque
Westralian feature of the lists, but not so much so
as the party who wants to deprive Glynn of his
Ministerial salary. This determined freebooter is
Joel M. Gabb.
The Nationalists are naturally getting the
bulk of the soldier candidates —the A.I.F.
looks on Hughes as anti-Bolshevik, what-
ever else he may be. But when the num-
bers go up it may be found a handicap. To
begin with, seven-eighths of the chosen are
officers of more or less high rank, which in
itself looks like an invidious pushing
aside of the poor blanky private. Further-
more, there is a feeling abroad that a good
soldier or sailor may make a rotten states-
man—a notion which is confirmed by every
London cable concerning the goings-on of
French, Fisher and other notabilities. And
finally there is the inevitable reaction
against “militarism.” It may have nothing
to do with those offering themselves, but
they will suffer for it. Lieut.-Colonel
Sinith-Jones, 0.8. E., might be wise, all
things considered, if he presented himself
as plain J. . Jones, Gent. A Gent is a color-
less person against whom no section has a
grievance; and voting goes by disfavor eight
times out of ten.
The borough of New Plymouth (M.L.)
has been converted into a co., w T ith the
council as board of directors and the town
clerk as general manager at a good salary.
It is the first case in Maoriland, and the
reason for it is that New Plymouth is going
in largely for trading. The council’s
electric-lighting enterprise has proved so
successful that a scheme is in hand to en-
large the town station and send juice to a
dozen lesser towns scattered around Mount
Egmont. Every year the lighting depart-
ment hands £5OOO to the borough, after run-
ning electric cars, ’buses, power and light
supplies at the lowest prices in the
Dominion. A committee has guided the
destinies of each business venture so far,
with expert men at the head of things. But
from now onward the departmental heads
will be responsible to the general manager.
This arrangement will probably save some
argument. New Plymouth is advertising
what kinds of manufacture it has openings
for, and the amount of cheap power its
power-houses can supply; and if Private
Enterprise does not come and start them,
the borough proposes to do so itself. Water-
power is plentiful in Taranaki, with Egmont
as a rain-maker, towering a mile and a half
into the clouds, and New Plymouth means
to make the most of it.
There seems to be still a large - ction of
the hang-the-war party in the Kp -ok. In the
pre-election ballot for a man t< run for Den-
ison, Laborites had the choice of Corporal
Keogh, who served personally and advocated
conscription, and King O’Malley, who did
neither. The King had a 15 to one majority.
THE WOMAN IN POLITICS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.
Archdeacon Hindley, of Melbourne, says he has
serious misgivings about the intervention'of women
in politics. There was danger in the member who
was “a brunette with soulful eyes, or a blonde : with
the voice and complexion of an angel.” The Arch-
deacon is most ungenerous in failing to give the poli-
tical woman, as she is known, credit for refusing
to employ the arts and graces that so terrify him.
1 am more just.
I see you on your platform, ma’am.
You comfort my condition.
I do not think your smile will damn
An honest politician.
Susceptible, a prey to guile
Is he, yet will not weaken
E’en though you lisp in coyest style,
Nor will your fascinating smile
Disturb a wise archdeacon.
I thank you for that nose you chafe
With reddening emotions—•
It is so eminently safe.
Nor from our high devotions
Will that keen eye your specs behind
With oglings too mesmeric
Disturb the meditative mind,
Or bring thoughts of an amorous kind
To blight a tender cleric.
The statesmen of our country dear,
Unmoved by fond commotions,
Thank Heaven for your copious ear.
They’re glad to find no “notions”
Inspired by feet with bumps and bends,
Or face that’s lined so gravely.
’Tis safety first, and wisely, friends,
That Providence which shapes our ends
Has fashioned yours so naively 1
VICTORIA.

In some respects the past year was an
abnormal one, for so many traders have
been seeking protection for their exception-
ally large and expensive stocks. Thus what
income was lost by curtailed marine rates
has been more than made up in other direc-
tions. Before proceeding further, look at

The figures in the first column are, of course,
net premiums. How different was the class
of business handled last year compared with
that of the previous few years can be
gauged by the fact that, though net premium
income increased by £49,420, gross premium
income expanded by only £13,461 —from
£434,156 to £447,617. Thus while in 1918
the management deemed it prudent to re-
insure 51.4 p.c. of the gross premiums, dur-
ing the past year only 41. S p.c. was
la id-o IT, which is very little more than
the average pre-war proportion. Last year’s
claims rate, though not so favorable as dur-
ing the previous abnormally good run. was
considerably under the general experience.
Of course, conditions have been very favor-
able for the cos., despite the fact that, so
iar ns workmen’s compensation is concerned,
reduced tariffs have left very little profit in
that business. So far as the fire department
was concerned, things might easily have
worked out badly if a slump in prices had
followed the very heavy importations earlier
in the year. There have been a few in-
stances where smaller men have been
squeezed by their holding of extensive and
costly stocks, but since the public has con-
tinued to feel prosperous on the money it
has borrowed from itself, generally there has
been very little difficulty in finding customers.
If the heavy loan spendings had given out
about the same time as the flood of expen-
sive merchandise stocks set in, insurance cos.
might have had a very different story to
tell.
Not premium income is now practically
double what it was in 1912; in other words,
in seven years the volume of the United’s
business has grown to an extent equal to the
whole of the insurances it had on its books
after a half-century. Perhaps changes in
management have helped to push things along,
for only two of the 1912 Board are still on
deck, while the former secretary is now in
the g.m.’s chair. But the expansion of
business is no greater than the very strong
position of the office warrants. After pay-
ing _tho current div.. funds amounted to
£505,741, equal to 194 p.c. of the year’s net
premiums, and almost sufficient to meet
claims equal to the aggregate losses of the
past six years, without taking incoming
premiums into consideration.
The directors are now moving to make the
position even stronger, and incidentally put-
ting shareholders on to something very
sweet. For a start, a further £20,000 of
reserves (surplus current profits actually
provide the amount) are being transferred
to capital, making the 40,000 £lO shares paid
to £5. Next, 5000 shares paid to £5 of the
10,000 unissued are to be put out at par
to present holders, making paid capital
£225.000. Combining this capital with the
£305.741 of reserves, the co. will have funds
of over £530,000, equal to 204 p.c. of
last year's net premium income, and ample
to cover losses exceeding five times those
experienced last year. In addition, there
will be, of course, £225,000 of uncalled capi-
tal to fall back upon if the worst should
happen. A glance at the capitalisation of
£lOO,OOO shown in the first table over the
past seven years, with the par issue now
being made, indicates how very well
shareholders have done. Even after the
latest capital shuffle, not one penny of the
underwriting profit should be required to
meet the usual 10 p.c. p.a. div. That rate
on the enlarged capital will call for £22,500
annually, but interest and rents alone last
year provided £23,870, or over 11 p.c. more
than in the previous year.
As in other insurance ottices the heavy in-
vestments in War Loans have made big
changes in the distribution of assets. Here
are the latest United figures, compared with
those for 1014:
1914. 1919.
Govt, securities £74,697 19.6 p.c. £226,132 36.2 p.c.

£382,759 £623,924
Of the total assets 65.8 p.c. is thus in public
securities, deposits and book debts. Last
year’s interest earnings worked out at 3.1)
p.c. of average assets compared with 3.2 p.c.
five years ago, and this .7 p.c. on the present
lot of assets means an additional income of
£4367 per annum : so the increase in interest
rates is alone sufficient to meet one-fifth of
the 10 p.c. div. on the enlarged capital.

Twelve months ago there were net assets
with a book value of 335. Bd. to represent
each £1 ordinary share ; at the latest balance,
only 275. Nevertheless, ordinary holders
are now almost, as well off so far as their
interest in the assets is concerned, while
their dividend return has improved. Early
this year £87,500 of reserves was capitalised,
but the directors adopted the unusual course
of issuing the bonus shares as 74 p.c. second
prefs., and allowing the 6 p.c. first prefs. to
share in the issue. For every two shares
in both classes one new 71 p.c. bonus pref.
share of £1 paid to 10s. was allotted. Thus
for every £lOO held by the old ordinary
shareholder the usual £lO per annum is being
paid, plus the div. on £25 worth of 74 p.c.
prefs., making the total return to the ordi-
naries 11| p.c. p.a. In the same way the
old 6 p.c. pref. holders are now actually re-
ceiving 71 p.c. p.a. To pay the divs. on both
classes of prefs. and also 10 p.c. to the
ordinaries now calls for £35,562 annually, so
there is still a wide margin of surplus profit
available for reserves.

Marcus Clark and Co. has been a very suc-
cessful concern. The business was estab-
lished 36 years ago, and it expanded so
rapidly that in 1902 the public was invited
in by the old proprietors, and the present co.
took, over, paying £72,377 for goodwill.
Shareholders were not a greedy crowd, for,
though the co. was doing very well, they were
content with 8 p.c. for many years. This
conservative policy enabled the goodwill item
to be extinguished early, and has since per-
mitted substantial reserves to be built up.
No new capital has been got in since 1911,
but meantime funds have grown by no less
than £102,069, representing an average of
£12,758 surplus profit stored up each year.
And it is not unlikely that internal reserves
have been piling up, too. The co. has been
handling a rapidly-increasing volume of t.-p.
business, a highly profitable line when con-
ditions are favorable, but one which has its
dangers. Though the rate at which these
long-distance accounts has been built up—
book debts are now shown at £305,566, which
is £107,488 more than just prior to the war
—suggests that the management does not
fear a tumble, no doubt substantial provision
has been made for contingencies. Probably
props have also been provided to protect the
heavy and expensive stocks against a slide.
If these suspicions are correct and every-
thing works out all right, then actual net
profits may prove to have been greater than
the figures recently disclosed. As it was, last
year's performance was a record. During the
war-period the co. did very well; after allow-
ing for contingencies arid depreciation, net
profits averaged £40,327 per annum compared
with the 3911-14 average of £35,572. capital
having remained stationary over the whole
of both periods, though the management now
has over £lOO,OOO more accumulated profit
invested in the business than eight years ago.
So, on published figures, at any rate, the co.
has not got much out of the Commonwealth
Government's method of war finance. Still
disclosed profits are dependent entirely on the
basis on which stocks and book-debts are
valued.
At the latest balance the co.'s assets had
a book value of £709,208, an expansion of
£118,990 on the figures of a year ago. Of
this increase stock represented £43,450 and
sundry debtors and hire-purchase balances
£02.102. To finance these heavy stocks and
carry the larger t.p. business, the co. had to
increase its liabilities by over £300,000. These
and other balance-sheet figures are shown in
this table, which also details the expansion
over two five-year periods:—

During the five years to 1934 the balance-
sheet position was visibly improved by
£7l,29Bduring the past live years, by
£66,634. The ordinaries have had 46 p.c. in
dividends during the latter period, compared
with 40 p.c. in the previous quinquennium.

To explain that blimp the directors cata-
logue the year’s troubles in this way
Trade in Queensland during- the year has been
affected by the severe drought, the shipping strike
and general labor unrest, restricting the circulation
of capital and causing unemployment and great dis-
tress. The cessation of hostilities has also had a
marked effect on business, the release of shipping
flooding the market with goods which, in many in-
stances, had to be realised, thereby causing dis-
organisation.
And even the profit of £3.6,151 is contingent
on the management being able to realise the
full book value of its abnormally large and
expensive stocks. With the certainty of a
poor time ahead of the pastoral industry
and stocks of almost double the book value
of the previous term, the balance-sheet posi-
tion does not look so comfortable as it did
a year ago:—
1909. 1914. 1918. 1919.
Liabilities . . £39,110 £24,043 £13,263 £47,058
Freeholds, etc. . . 37,881 59,763 63,011 62,845
Book debts . . 91,699 81,240 75,306 53,080

War Loan.. 33,125 33,125
Cash . . . . 6,550 16,268 9.889 483
Though the co.’s chances of avoiding being
hit by a slump in prices seem reasonably
good, despite the fact that the heavy stocks
have been accumulated at a time when the
turnover will be considerably reduced, there
is another factor to take into account:
whether, as a result of the disastrous effects
of the drought, the book debts which the
management will acquire in unloading the
stock will all come up to scratch. Of course
adverse years are inevitable in concerns
which make their living from an industry de-
pendent so much on the weather, and the only
basis on which their progress (or otherwise)
can be judged is by comparison of a series of
terms, such as those shown above.
Until 10 years ago Rich and Co. was
London-controlled. It had been established
10 years earlier, but having got into diffi-
culties owing to drought and other troubles,
for some time it was nursed by Dal-
gety’s. By 1910 the co. had extricated itself,
and the Australian register getting control,
the headquarters were moved to Sydney. But
as Queensland seemed to hold out the best
promises, five years ago the directors decided
to go out of business in N. S. Wales, and,
except for working the Circular Quay bonded
and fr-cte stores, the co. now confines its
operations to the northern State. Since
then considerably improved earnings have
shown up, though favorable seasons and high
prices, consequent on war conditions, have
helped to make the new policy a success.
During the five years since the move north,
shareholders have had 364 p.c. in divs. —
almost as much as they had received in the
previous eight, when the co. was suffering
a recovery from its earlier troubles. Not
only have better divs. been paid, but the past
quinquennium has seen visible reserves
strengthened by over £21,000, an improve-
ment equal to four times the total reserves
showing up in 1914. So, besides securing
a better return on their investment, share-
holders hate had their interests more strongly
entrenched. Paid capital has for many
years been £108,037 in £1 shares, and to re-
present each share there are now net liquid
assets with a book value of 17s. 4d. and a
further 6s. 4d. in properties, plant, etc.

The report of Royal-Commissioner Jas. L.
Campbell, K.C., on the' N; S. Wales coal-
mining industry, presented to the State Par-
liament last week, furnishes the most con-
demnatory evidence so far revealed of the
Hughes Government’s abuse of the War
Precautions Act. In December, 1016, the
coal-miners demanded an increase in wages
and easier working conditions. Negotiations
failing, the miners resorted to direct, action.
Thereupon Hughes stepped in, and, Justice
Higgins having declined to act, appointed
Judge Rdmunds, of the N.K.W. State Arbi-
tration Court to “settle the dispute.” That
Judge, without taking evidence, and “appa-
rently regarding the making of an order as
obligatory atton him under the terms of his
commission ,” granted increases up to 21) p.c.
in wages, and directed an increase of 3s. in
the selling price of coal. Having found
Hughes easy on that occasion, 12 months
later the miners, despite the fact that they
had undertaken lo abide by the agreement
for three years, decided to press the Govern-
ment again, with the result that Acting-
Prime Minister Watt “found himself con-
strained. without anything more in the
nature of an inquiry into the merits of the
demand” than in the previous case, to con-
cede further increases of as much as 15 p.c.
Everything went smoothly until May of this
year, when, following upon further, demands
by the unions, the Federal Government,
again by War Precautions regulation, sus-
pended all contracts and agreements for the
supply of coal, transferred the entire output
to Federal control, granted the miners’ de-
mands and increased the price by a further
2s. 9d. This move on the part of the
Nationalist Federal Government so disturbed
the Nationalist State Government that it ap-
pointed a Commission to make the inquiries
which the Federal Government should have
made before sabotaging arbitration machin-
ery and blindly burdening the industry with
costs, employing to that end an Act which
it was never intended should be used for
such purposes.
Commissioner Campbell’s report bears out
all that The Bulletin claimed concerning
the troubles which the Hughes Government
has brought upon the industry by its gross
misuse of this War Precautions Act, and it
further confirms some of the suspicions this
paper has expressed as to whether the in-
crease in selling prices did not far more than
cover the extra wages. The Commissioner
puts his conclusions this way
In the light of the facts and the inferences that
may be legitimately drawn from them, it seems to
me impossible to avoid the conclusion that, so far
as the colliery employees in the Maitland district
are concerned, the demand for increased rates and
the concession to that demand made by Federal
authority on May 2, 1919, were unwarranted by any-
thing in the existing situation, considered merely
from an industrial or economic standpoint.
There is no doubt that the average earnings of
the colliery employees in the other fields were at
the time, with a few exceptions, below the standard
of necessary requirement, and, no matter how the
low averages may have been aggravated by the action
of the men themselves, something had to be done to
meet a situation of general stress and individual
hardship. It may be questioned, however, whether it
was wise on any ground to lay upon an essential
product like coal an impost to serve an immediate
purpose of relief, which, in the circumstances under
which it arose, was primarily one of benevolence,
without regard to whether the industry should per-
manently support the burden, and also apparently
without regard to the probable or possible effect on
the general economic situation that must be faced
after the war. Particularly does this question arise
in a case where, after the emergency has passed, the
consequences of precipitate and ill-considered action
can only be redressed at the cost of industrial dis-
turbance and discontent.
The remedy for the situation should rather have
been sought in some system of organised production
and marketing, which might have made provision
for the suspension of work in some of the collieries,
and particularly in those whose trade was peculiarly
affected by the war, and for whose output there was
virtually no local market. The men displaced in
the process, would, of course, have had to be absorbed
into other employment, but that should have pre-
sented less economic objection than the loading of
coal production with an additional burden of cost,
which was gratuitous, so far as, the main producing
field was concerned, and not imperative in any other
if proper methods of dealing with the situation had
been adopted.... There are not many who would say

that the evidence put forward by the colliery em-
ployees or their representatives in support of their
demands was reasonably adequate to the occasion, or
the opportunity for forming: a judgment on the
justice of the matter such as was reasonably required
by the complicated and momentous issues to be
determined.
Insufficient time has elapsed to ascertain
how much of the latest increase of price has
been swallowed by additional production
costs; but as to the January, 1916, increase
of Is. per ton and the January, 1917, in-
crease of 35., the Commissioner finds that
“only in one instance, on each occasion, was
the whole of the amount of the increase ab-
sorbed by increased cost of production.” For
instance, the Maitland collieries, which dur-
ing the past four years produced over 38 p.c.
of the State’s total output, returned the pro-
prietors Is. per ton more profit after the 3s.
increase in 1917, the Teralba group 2s. per
ton more, the Western collieries almost a
like amount, while Newcastle and Southern
mines also showed an increased profit, under
Is. per ton, but “still respectable.”
So much for the Hughes Government’s
“settlement” of the coal problem. The Com-
mission did more than examine the justifica-
tion or otherwise of the increases in wages
and prices; it was appointed to inquire into
the coal-mining industry and coal trade gen-
erally, “without limiting or confining the
general nature of the inquiry.” The ques-
tion of prospects and recommendations as
to how some problems should be met are
left to a further report; the present one is
mostly restricted to following the industry
through the changing conditions of the past
few years. The volume now presented is
a mine of information, well compiled and con-
taining valuable comparative statistics.
Looking at the industry broadly Commis-
sioner Campbell does not consider that the
conditions are satisfactory from the point of
view either of the State or of the public.
He says :—-
Any waste associated with a product and industry
of such fundamental importance as that of coal is
deplorable, and, apart from any question of ultimate
national injury, the State and public are immediately
and directly concerned with the effect of waste on
cost and price. That such waste exists, both in the
material and in the • functions of the industry, and
in the organisation, or want of organisation, of the
trade, appears incontestable, and calls imperatively
for consideration and remedy. This need for more
effective organisation, and for the discovery of some
means of establishing a more successful co-ordination
of the forces of both the industry and the trade,
has been made abundantly clear in the course of the
inquiry.
The decline of the Newcastle mines since
Maitland coals took precedence in demand
and popularity was thoroughly investigated.
The Commissioner finds that
this decline is due less to inferiority of the product,
as compared with that from the Maitland area, than
to a weakened productive and trade organisation. ...
There are still enormous quantities available, if only
there existed a sufficient market. There has,
apparently, been no sustained attempt to create or
discover new fields of utility and consumption. As
a coking coal, there is reason to believe the Bore-
hole seam supplies a product superior to all other
State coals, in that it cokes as well, if not better,
and is richer in residuals and the elements of manv
by-products.
So he concludes that “one of the most urgent
problems” to restore the lost trade to the
Newcastle district mines is to “arrest the
flood of waste” :
The introduction of by-product recovery ovens of
modern type, and the manufacturing and marketing
of the coke and the by-products, such as ammonium
sulphate, benzol, tar, liquid fuel, motor spirit, and the
chemical essentials of many manufacturing processes,
should prove as profitable here as elsewhere. It is
one obvious way of increasing coal production and
reducing cost; and it might rescue the Newcastle
mines from the decay that seems to be eating the
heart out of that section of the industry, and serve as
an ultimate corrective to certain wage anomalies, j
Exhaustive inquiry was made into profits,
cost of production, trade organisation, etc.,
and much interesting information was dug
out. The Bulletin will have something
to say on these matters later on.
The final chapter in Bowron Bros. Ex-
port and Trading Co., Ltd., will close when
shareholders meet in Christchurch (M.L.)
next month to receive the liquidators’ final
statements. The co. was aJ. Earle Her-
mann float, and the concern was run from
his Sydney office —and very little more need
be added. It was born in trouble and bad
odor, and during its early years the smell
intensified. The liquidators found that
irregular shares and transfers representing
180,958 shares in excess of the 140,240
regularly-issued shares had been circulated.
They had to meet claims under these shares
amounting to over £64,000, but were able
to settle for under £3OOO in cash, with 3600
shares ranking for final dividend. The
liquidators considered the question of prose-
cuting Hermann, who was committed to
gaol on other charges, but “as such a prose-
cution, even if successful, would not have
brought in any assets, it was decided not to
take any step in that direction.” From
the sale of the business the liquidators were
apparently able to give shareholders £23 12s.
Bd. in 6 p.c. debentures, repayable in 1925,
issued by the purchasing co., Woolston Tan-
neries, Ltd., for every £lOO of capital, and
also distribute a cash div. of Gd. per share.
Now £445 in cash remains to be disposed of
—less than Id. per share —and as the three
liquidators have had only £1551 among them
for four years’ unsavory and difficult work,
there is a suggestion that this balance should
go to them. They deserve it.

During the six months covered by the last
accounts the mine at Broken Hill operated
for only about five weeks. At the end of
that time the unions, after quarrelling among
themselves, came out on strike —or, at least,
all those that mattered did. Months ago
the strike would have been broken if any-
body had been much concerned to do it; but
the cos. didn’t care very much whether they
worked or not, there being a prodigious
quantity of lead and zinc to be absorbed,
and the workpeople’s demands had been
growing quite impossible. So in a country
where strikes are supposed to be illegal this
one has been permitted to drag on for over
six months. In the end there will no doubt
be arbitration of some kind; and if the pre-
siding Judge asks how the men and their
families have been living during these months
he may possibly get a hint as to whether
previous rates of pay were as close to the
border-line of mere existence as they were
alleged to be. Two things are certain:
on the whole Broken Hill hasn’t been stint-
ing itself during the six months of strike,
and the outside contributions have been
almost negligible.
But though the mine was worked for only
about five weeks out of the 26, large sur-
pluses were received from sales made in
previous terms and only now finally settled
for; so that, after putting by £lO,OOO for
“railway charges and contingent exes, on
zinc concentrates stored at Broken Hill,” a
profit of £22,677 is disclosed. But £17,550
is written off to cover depreciation of shares
in other cos., so only the £5127 shown above
is left. The surplus of liquid assets has,
however, been increased by £15,696 —from
£75,431 to £91,127, two-thirds of it repre-
sented by War Loans and cash. These
liquid assets do not include the interest in
the Misima (Papua), which, though it has
called for more money during the half-year,
has been written down to £37,892. How
Misima stands was discussed in this column
a w r eek or so ago. Apart from the possi-
bilities there (and the regularity with which
“unforeseen difficulties” have turned up is
enough to make even the most sanguine
prophet wary), the co. has surplus liquid
assets worth about 18s. 3d. per share, a mine
from which a good many tens of thousands
of tons of ore can be scraped up (the odds
and ends take a long while to exhaust in a
big mine like this), a mill and flotation
plant, and a contract for joint treatment
with Block 14.
* * * *
B.H. Block 14’s last half-year very ap-
propriately commenced on All Fools’ Day.
Except for five weeks’ work on the mine the
co. has done nothing more than realise on
.some of its accumulated stocks, collect a Is.
div. (£1972) from its King Island Scheelite
interests, keep an eye on the lead market, and
wonder when the Barrier unions are going
to weary of their little joke. Only 896 tens
carbonates went to Pt. Pirie, and 2774
tons sulphides were put through Block 10’s
mill for the co. Still, with the help of sur-
pluses in excess of book values of old stocks
realised, the Scheelite div., and £402 interest
from War Loan, £32,012 of revenue flowed
in and a net profit of £9296 resulted. The
prefs. got their 10 p.c. p.a., leaving £7796
available. This would have given a six-
penny, but shareholders are denied a taste
because of the uncertain outlook. Regard-
ing the Scheelite interests as liquid, at Sept.
30 there was a surplus of liquid assets over
liabilities of £57,390, compared with £47,977
six months previously.

N. S. Wales Mines Department figures
show a big decline in this year’s gold out-
put, and the shrinkage is traceable directly
to the drought. To the end of October only
46,6330 z. (fine) were recorded compared
with 72,6290 z. last year, the falling off in
value being £110,424. The small producer
has been practically put out of business for
want of water, and some of the big shows
have been shut down. Mount Boppy, in the
Cobar district, and the State’s principal
producer, has had to give it best till the
drought breaks.
Ivingsgate Molybdenite (N.S.W.) has at
last got to the mining stage. The co. is
opening up four pipes out of the 50 on its
claim, so it will not be long before costs of
mining and treatment can be compared with
estimates and yields set against ore values
claimed. For export an 85 p.c. product is
asked, but there are whispers that the little
crowd which rules the trade south of the
Thermo-Electric sphere of influence won’t
haggle over a lower-grade concentrate. But
wliat will be accepted in bismuth is not told.
Still, the market for both metals gives
promise of continuine- steady.
Emmaville (N.S.W.) is suffering badly
from the drought. Seven plants in the dis-
trict are either closed down or working in-
termittently. Pond’s Creek recently de-
cided not to pay a dividend till the water
outlook improved, but the plant is still
going on in good ground, though the mix-
ture in the bottom of the big dam no longer
looks like water. A close-down will be
necessary if rain does not soon appear. The
Stannum bucket dredge and the Wyalong,
Buffalo and Bouveret sluicing plants are
silent. The Great Britain plant on its new
site near the edge of the town is also held
up.
Gundagai Long Tunnel (N.S.W.) pro-
mises another clean-up before the end of
this month. The battery was started about
four weeks ago, and mine-manager Allen,
who is running only one shift, calculated on
treating 85 tons stone each week. Still,
despite the recent expenditure to ensure a
permanent supply, an anxious eye is being-
kept on the dam.

The expected has happened at Westonia.
The Central plan of allowing the water to
rise to about 250 ft., so as to make the lift
with the pumps as light as possible, has
brought in the State. Minister Scaddau did
not wait to be told that there were other
interests than those of Edna Central to be
considered. Possibly the accident at the
Consolidated and the creepy shaft of that
mine put fear into the hearts of the inspec-
tors. Anyhow Scaddan has rushed through
a Bill which will give him the right to com-
pel cos. to take steps to protect the miners’
lives and the property the cos. lease from
the State.

Lake View and Oroya’s net revenue for
the year ended June 30 last was £22,140,
about £llBO more than for the previous
year. These profits were insufficient to pay
a div. of more than 6d. per share, so no
distribution was made; but since there were
reserves amounting to £127,089 the directors
decided to put out 103,130 new bonus
shares, equal to one share for every seven
held. The co.’s most important share in-
terests, which include 100,000 Burma

annual meeting chairman Govett bitterly
attacked the British revenue authorities for
taxing capital increment. The shareholders
propose to alter the name of the' co. to the

South Kalgurli’s receipts for its last
financial year totalled £128,725. The aver-
age yield per ton was 265. Bd., and all but
3s. of this was absorbed by working costs.
Actual ore reserves are estimated at 155,944
tons of_7.4Bdwt. ore, and probable reserves at
108, 1 85 tons of 6dwt. stone. The feature
of the year’s work was the opening up of
what appears to be a new make of stone
on the east side of the 10th. 12th and 15tli
levels, drives having exposed a lot of good
stuff.

For some years Kalgoorlie Tramways,
Ltd., has been unable to give shareholders
a taste, but if everything works out well at
Hampton Plains there is still a gleam of
hope. The year’s receipts totalled £33,950
compared with £32,979 for the previous i 2
months, while net profits, before allowing
for depreciation, were £6lOl, as against
£3928. Increased fares added £1097 to the
year’s receipts, but additional wages neces-
sitated the cutting down of the car mileage,
by which means the management saved
nearly £lOOO in power. If Hampton Plains
turns out trumps a lot of money will have
to be spent on plant.
The high price of coal threatens to give
the Outtrim-llowitt (Vic.) a second life.
Peter Mcßryde shut the co. out of the Powlett
basin scheme because he wanted the State
to monopolise that field, and as the Outtrim
mine had run out of workable seams Stamp
and Nicholson pegged out Kilcunda. This is
a has-been of the L. L. Smith days let go
because of Newcastle and Outtrim* competi-
tion and because of difficulties of transport.
The seams are narrow so far as developed,
but_ the coal is good Gippsland, which is
saying a lot so far as calorific values go.
Hence the State would probably give Outtrim
some support to re-establish it as a coal-
winner. To get funds capital is to be in-
creased by £15,000. As the plant is on the
ground and the mine partly opened up, the
whole of this new capital should not be re-
quired before the outputting of coal is re-
sumed. In the Board-room costs are worked
out at 9s. 6d. per ton ; so with coal at 80s.
and a daily production of 100 tons, profits
should be easy. A big block of Outtrim
shares used to be held in England.

The S. and M. mine at Middlesex (Tas.)
plods on its way, the owners seeking no
publicity, though the property is known to
be highly remunerative. Last year’s pro-
duction was hampered by adverse conditions,
the ore milled being only 6404 tons for 59
tons tin, 31 tons wolfram and 4 tons _bis-
muth, of an approximate value of £13,500.
The lodes are strong and, persistent, pockets
of bagging-grade bismuth being a feature
of the show. Magnetic separation is done
on the mill concentrate in Launceston, high-
grade products of each metal being secured.

“V.J.”: How is it that the wolfram-
molybdenite people have not investigated the
Ollera field (N.Q.) to any extent? Cer-
tainly Jack Wilcox had a look at the Better
Luck on behalf of a Sydney crowd, but the
owners opened their mouths too wide when
they asked £lO,OOO for what was little more
than a prospect. There is a larger lode on
this field than at Wolfram Camp, where
the English concern, Thermo Electric, Ltd.,
is operating. So far about £30,000 metal
has been dug out, and the deepest show, on
Peter Bell’s lease, is down 200 ft., where a
thousand-gallon-per-hour flow of water has
held up operations. Some day more will
be heard of Ollera as a rare-metal producer.

Artist Fred McCubbin had the job of
painting Alfred Deakin’s portrait for the
Commonwealth Memorials Gallery, and a
very trying task he found it. Deakin was
a sick and exceedingly weary man, taking
small interest in earthly things. He was
anxious to figure in the gallery, but his
memory failed him strangely at times, and
he so far forgot himself on one occasion as
to thirik he was at the barber’s. Rallying
his subject a little one morning, McCubbin
said : “You know we will never succeed in
getting a life-like picture if you don’t make
an effort to shake off this drowsiness.”
Deakin shook his head mournfully. “Any-
thing life-like would bear no resemblance to
me as I am. Mr. McCubbin,” he said,
Hughes rarely has the same press-booster
twice, as the position isn’t chased by former
occupants. His stipendiary trumpeter for
the present campaign is Alfred Buchanan,
who left the Age a few years back to become
editor of Brisbane Daily Mail, and last
year stepped off the Inky Way to breast the
Bar. Buchanan has published several novels,
so the supplying of campaign fiction should .
prove an easy job for him. Also, he knows
the things about Ryan that Hughes wants
to know.
BROOMFIELD , K.G., who has been ex-
changing compliments with Richard
Denis Meagher in Sydney.
Death disguised as an electric tram came
suddenly upon James Colvin, M.P. for Buller
(M.L.), in Wellington. The old man was
counted out very quickly from concussion.
Though 75, “Uncle” had a clear, kind, brown
eye and a sunny smile. He was as blithe
as a boy, in spite of his flowing white
beard. Crossing from Donegal to Australia
in 1861 he went to Otago a year later, and
then to the West Coast. He had represented
Buller continuously since he defeated P. J.
O’Regan at the elections in 1899. and he
was killed in the closing hours of his last
session in the Lower House. He wasn’t
going to ask his friends to- vote for him
again, but he would have had a seat in the
Upper House.
Dr. Otto von Hirselifeldt, Consul in
Bananaland for Germany when war broke
out. and later interned, was arrested again
last week after being allowed to return to
his home in Brisbane. The son, it is said,
of a German Jew “ennobled” by Bismarck
(hence the “von”), Hirselifeldt went through
Bonn University and achieved among other
things the “schlager”-ehopped face that is
the hallmark of the swagger Hun student.
He began practice in Brisbane in the ’nineties,
married a Bananaland girl, and became
naturalised. He succeeded Yon Plennies as
Consul for Germany, and a year or so
before the war was made an M.L.C. (That,
by the way, was the occasion on which The
Bulletin printed a remarkable forecast
made by its old contributor Peter Airey.)
As Consul he worked to weld the German
community. Every year on the Kaiser’s
birthday there was a great German carnival
in Brisbane; to which Huns flocked from
all parts of the State. The proceedings were
Deutschland über Alles to the last note. In
spite of protests, Government encourage-
ment was given, and the Courier, which
had printed produce-market quotations in
German for years, reported the proceedings
in Hun. It was for stealing the papers in
Hirschfeldt’s case and attempting to dispose
of them to his wife that the Defence De-
partment clerk Tilanus and solicitor llolz-
berger were recently convicted in Brisbane.
From the Bar table: —
Until a man is actually on the Bench you can't
be sure what sort of a Judge he will make; and then
it doesn’t take long to find out. Griffith was a very
great Judge, but a rather selfish one. He lived to
himself to an extraordinary degree. Passing from
capital to capital he rarely spoke to his colleagues.
011 the Bench he would call for an authority, con-
sult it, and return it. There were no interchanges
of “happy thoughts” on the Bench. He made the
High Court rather a Crown
of Thorns for the heads of the
profession who reached it.
Knox isn’t going to do any-
thing like that. Already the
Bench shows that it is a
happier family. Knox appears
to make a point of putting
everything that comes before
him before his colleagues, too,
and Isaacs in particular. And
Isaacs will, of course, turn to
Rich, for these two have come
much closer than they were.
It may be nothing else, but at
any rate the High Court
Bench promises to be a better
working team. One thing may
be hoped, even prayed for —that
this won’t loosen the tongues of the Judges. Already
there is rather much talk from the Bench. And the
worst offender is his Honor who used to complain
most about it when he was at the Bar.
Sydney Sampson, many years M.H.R. for
the Wimmera (Vic.)," is to be opposed by
.Peter Stewart of the Farmers’ Union, who
has resigned his Assembly seat (Swan Hill)
to go for the bigger prize. Sampson, who
runs the Warracknabeal Herald, was appa-
rently considered quite a suitable person to
have the farmers’ vote ; but, as he refused the
invitation to get aboard the machine, the
machine will try to run over him instead.
Stewart, being a farmer with a long experi-
ence as a battling baekblocker, will have a
rosy chance, the Mallee having had of late
a remarkable awakening to its own political
importance.
For the first time in its existence the Bar
of N. S. Wales has two English K.C.’s.
C. G. Wade has taken silk in London.
Hughes, of course, is the other.
The Nationalists have one candidate, at
any rate, who has “done time.” Twenty-
seven years ago Dick Sleath was tried at
Deniliquin, along with W. J. Ferguson and
other Broken Hill strike-leaders, for con-
spiracy, and sent up for two years or so,
which he spent at Goulburn. After that, ol
course, he got a seat in the Assembly ; but
he kicked over the traces and lost the job.
Sleath was, in his Broken Hill strike-leader
days, a comparative youngster ; blit no man
ever had a firmer hold on a Broken Hill
crowd, and no man ever showed more organ-
ising capacity among the miners. And he
was courageous, too. He bought a share
in the B. H. Prop, and attended a meeting
of shareholders in the middle of the strike.
In terror the directors engaged J. L. Purves
to also attend the meeting. When Sleath
spoke of the workers Purves said “Workers!
He’s no worker, look at his hands!” Sleath
promptly held out his big paws. “They are
clean,” he said. “Now, Mr. Purves, let us
see yours!” As usual, Sleath fights a for-
lorn hope. He has tackled West Sydney
against T. .T. Ryan.
Passed out in Hobart, at 84, John C.
Mawle, who was storekeeper and other
things at Port Arthur in the convict days.
The old man did not realise his hopes of
seeing his reminiscences published.
Tom Mann’s former protege, A. K. Wal-
lace, won the Albert Park seat in the Vie.
Assembly, which Hannan relinquished to
try conclusions with Maxwell for Fawkner.
Though the contest was considered a pre-
liminary canter for Fawkner —part of
which it is—only 40 per cent, of the dec-
ors voted. During the contest Captain Cull,
Wallace’s opponent, was asked at a meet-
ing what his religion was. He replied that
it was his country, and that the doxology of
it was written on his body—his body that
is now much maimed.
Bruce Smith’s Labor opponent in Parkes
(N.S.W.) is Arthur Jones, the original sec-
retary of the Sydney Clerks’ Union, and a
man who, prior to that, earned the sack by
giving evidence upon shop-clerks’ conditions
before the first N. S. Wales Arbitration
Court. On that occasion he showed how
the married employees of frill-retailers
managed the struggle of life on 30s. per week.
In the election before last lie opposed Hos-
kins, M.L.A.; but when the last was being
held he was in the fighting-line—-although
ho had to leave six children to get there.
Ivor MacGillivray, one of the pioneers of
the S. Aus. Labor party, has just toiled up
to the 80th post. Born in the north of
Scotland, he spent some years at sea, then
went to Maoriland, and was a member of
the committee which put Seddon into his
first public position and a worker for Hori
Grey. In the ’seventies he crossed to S.
Aus., and became connected with what is
now the Union of Waterside Workers. lie
was one of the first four Labor men sent
to the House of Assembly, and for a quarter
of a century had the respect of members.
THE BOGEY MAN.
“N. S. Wales Governor Davidson says that it
would be a grave mistake to reduce the number of
representatives from the Old Country.”
HiS EX.: “And if yon. ever get thinking you
can pull along without us, something
dreadful ’ll happen to you!”
Then he battled for conscription, and his
party dropped h m for a young man who said
“Australia’s done enough”—a son, by the
way, of old Labor-leader John Verran, who
also lost his job in Parliament over the con-
scription issue. During his 25 years as an
M.P. MacGillivray missed only one sitting,
and that was because a train ran late."
The old man didn’t save enoug’h from his
poor Parliamentary screw to keep him in
his old age, and he is now employed by the
Wheat Board at Port Adelaide.
John Rockliff, dead at Baulkamaugh
(Vie.), was a practical farmer who stood a
long way out of the ruck. He was one of
the of what is now the wealthy
Goulburn Valley—a large, brown-bearded
man with a turn for affairs. Since 1910 he
had been on the Agricultural Society Coun-
cil, a position which he reached largely
through his efforts to introduce eugenics into
the cowyard. He also helped to found the
Numurkah Leader, which trampled with
such vigor on its reptile contemporary that
a long, weary, expensive law-case had to be
fought out in the courts, providing costs
with a lot of nice pickings from both sides.
Like Poll, who put her arms akimbo and
talked at the Port Admiral, Fighting Larry
Rentoul, undeterred by the perfhme of
sanctity floating around him at the Vic.
Kirk Assembly, said “You be damned !” but
as it was only “Jim” (he scorned, he said,
to say Eamonn) de Valera he was consign-
ing to the flames, nobody seemed to mind.
Larry appeared to be aggrieved that he was
not invited to the Irish Race Convention.
There would have been some good copy, cer-
tainly, if he had been —with the raypoorters
also admitted.
A bunch of good men who did their bit are
candidates in the Maoriland elections next
month. But for ill-health General Russell
would have headed the detachment. As it is
the roll begins with Brig.-General Meldrum.

Mackeney (Mars-

Coates, present
holders of port-
folios in the Mas-
sey Ministry. Cap-
tain Tom Seddon,
son of old Dick, is

tain V. Potter will
oppose Gtinson for
the Roskill (Auck-
land ) seat, and
Lieut. W. Downie-

edin East broncho
is up in the air.
Most of the nine
are likely winners.
BISHOP
NEVILL,

Primate of Maori-
land, who is going
out of business.
Dr. Constance D’Arcy won a seat in Syd-
ney Uni. Senate handsomely. Of four doctors
included in the Ten only Dr. Purser polled
better. “A fair thing,” said hundreds of
men graduates as they gave the one woman
candidate a vote. But the most astonishing
thing was the Chief Justice’s vote —over 250
ahead of Prof. MacCallum (he is leaving his
chair, otherwise he wouldn’t have to go to
election), and 300 past Frank Leverrier, and
nearly 700 ahead of Vice-chancellor Fer-
guson, most widely esteemed among men and
Judges.
“Old V.D.L.”: Melbourne Herald says
that Mrs. A. B. Brown, who was born at
Circular Head in 1827 and died at Geelong
(Vic.) the other day, was the first white
child born in Tasmania, and was given 1000
acres by the Government as a reward. By
1827 the first white children born* in Tas-
mania had come of age, and a plentiful
supply had been growing up right through
the 23 years which had passed since the
founding of Hobart and Port Dalrymple. The
first white child born in Tasmania, Mrs.
Vimpany. died nearly 20 years ago at the age
of 90-odd. Even she did not get 1000 acres
for the intelligence she showed in being
born early.
Peter Simonoff, the long-legged Bolshevik,
doesn’t consul any more for Lenin and Co.
After the Brisbane red-flag riot of last year,
which led to the Russians’ secretary, Susenko.
being deported, their association wilted, and
now they carry on quietly and hopefully with-
out any frills. The other night they cele-
brated the anniversary of the Social Revolu-
tion with a few songs and speeches, and dur- ; ,
ing the proceedings two pretty, dark-eyed
young damns strolled around and pinned to
the coat-lapel of every “comrade” a flaring
red emblem. Unsuspectingly they approached
the Law (two of it in plain clothes) and
decorated it. too, with the red badge of non-
sense. For a moment the Law’s complexion
harmonised nicely.
“Go slow” hasn't white-anted every in-
dustry in Australia. Mrs. Lydia M. Col-
bran, who died at Ivogarah (Sydney) lately,
aged 90, had seven children, 55 grand-
children, 80 great-grandchildren and one
g.-g.-grandchild. Total, 143. Living, 120.
“General” W. Bramwell Booth, chief of
the Sa.lv’Army, has made up his mind to
tour Australia in the middle of 1920. It is
about 17 years since he succeeded picturesque
old patriarch William, who, by the way,
raged through the Commonwealth three
times. Bram, is 63..
Long Joe Hannan, selected Labor can-
didate for Fawkner (Vic.), is one of the
few Labor politicians who have stuck to
the “industrial” wing of the movement.
Representing a metal-workers’ union on
Melbourne Trades Hall Council for a long
time, Joe seldom missed a meeting, and
always held his end up in debate. No
union matter was too small for him to dip
into. He represented Fawkner for a term,
but was knocked back by lawyer Maxwell
at the last dust-up; then, after Emslie’s
death, he sat for Albert Park in Vic.
Assembly. Now he leaves a safe seat for
a barely possible.
TO MYSELF ON MY BIRTHDAY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.
Many happy returns! So the candle still burns
And the pen brings you —what’s it they pay?
Well, as one who well knows all your pleasures and
woes,
Let me wish you a happy birthday.
We are getting on now, but we won’t make a row,
For the years skip away as of old,
And, though forty is near, the horizon is clear,
And the wolf is still out in the cold.
With a seventh-class brain you’ve no cause to com-
plain
(You will pardon this candor, 1 know.
I’m your intimate friend, and shall be to the end,
Quite regardless of where you may go).
You have worked a big bluff and you write silly stuff,
But it seems to go down, as you say ;
If the world is content to keep paying your rent,
You’ve a right to a happy birthday.
Life’s a grim sort of joke. Better men have gone
broke,
Disappeared or gone out in the war;
But you’re still in the rout, you’re not half up the
spout,
And they read you (Heaven knows what it’s for!).
Yet grey hairs are a cue, and I’m certain that 30U
Feel you ought to be up and away.
Still, old man, as you’re here, at the end of the year,
I can wish you a happy birthday.
. (D —d old fool!)
Well, here’s luck and a happy birthday!

A Modern Philosopher, Lecturer and a Great Student writes that Clements Tonic
certainly a Medicine for the Tired Brain.
THE REVEREND GEORGE WALTERS has had a long and active career as a
Minister of the Unitarian Denomination, as a student of modern philosophy and
Siience, and as a literary critic and dramatist.
jlTis church work extends from Lancashire and Aberdeen, United Kingdom, to
Melbourne and Sydney, Australia. He is author of the dramatic works,
Joseph of Canaan,” “Thou Fool,” and “Empire,” or the “Tragedy of Maxi-
rmlhan in Mexico.” He has also been President of the Shakspeare Society of
South Wales, and is an active member and vice-president of the Dickens
Fellowship.
The following letter should be read by all students and members of the Literary
Societies of New South Wales with exceptional interest: —
w
Clements Tonic Lid., Rozelle, Sydney, N.S.W.
CLEiIENTS TONIC LTD.
“ have much pleasure in testifying that I have, at various times, derived much benefit from taking
Clements Tonic.
“When feeling ‘run down and in need of ‘ winding up,’ or when suffering from brain=fag and nerve
strain, a short course of Clements Tonic has invariably brought relief and consequent re=invigoration.
“ It helps one to say (with little * Pippa,’ in Browning’s poem):
“‘God’s in His Heaven; all’s right with the World.’’’

If any greater proof is required of the powers of this splendid medicine, the testi-
monies given afford it, written by those who can well afford by experience to jud°-e of
its merits. For the general good of the public they are published, and are well worth

“Digger, M.D.”: The business training
which blinded A.I.F. men received at St.
Dun stall’s Hostel, as described in B.
RANK INJUSTICE.
“At the Wheat Inquiry witness said that he did
not disagree with the idea of putting paper in the
stacks. The mice had been ripping the bags for
material for their nests. The paper was put in the
stacks to provide them with other material.” — Sun.
LANGUID LUKE: “Slime! The Gov’merit's

23/10/Y9, is now bearing fruit. Financed
by the Red Cross Society, 18 sightless mem-
bers of the A.I.F. (with power to add to
their number) have set up in business
as tea-salesmen in Sydney. These Diggers
will thus be aide to associate at once on
terms of equality Avith their fellow-beings
in a business undertaking Avhose success
should be assured from the kick-off. This
should dissipate any tendency to morbidness
that might be present, for men suddenly
blinded are easily plunged into abysses of
despondency. Sir Arthur Pearson, who went
to Canada to get into touch with his beloved
St. Dunstaners, was desirous of visiting Aus-
tralia in the interest of his protegees, but
the length of the trip was an obstacle. How -
ever, he has deputed Captain Nobbs to make
inquiries and look up all St. Dunstaners
Avith a view of letting him know that their
material comfort is being attended to.

At a Sydney banquet last iveek, Governor
Davidson “urged that Australia should train
ambassadors to represent her abroad, com-
mencing with youth, as was done with men
Avho were great in governmental affairs of
Great Britain.” Well, the practice is mori-
bund in Great Britain, and has always been
condemned outside the little society clique
from which Foreign Office clerks and at-
taches (and, incidentally, State Governors)
are drawn. “The surest way to make a
foolish ambassador,” said Samuel Coleridge
a century ago,, “is to bring him up to it.”
.Tames Bryce, who was brought up to be a
barrister, and Lord Reading, who graduated
for the Bar via the London Stock Exchange,
are two recent appointments to Washington;
and America’s greatest ambassadors have
been men like Joseph Choate (a lawyer) and
Whitelaw Reid (a journalist).

“G.P.” : It was thought in 1913 that the
price paid for the full-length portrait of
Lady de la Pole by Romney would never
be topped. The late Lord Michelham bought
the picture at Christie’s in London for
£43,640; but a cool nine thousand more has
been got by the Duke of Hamilton for
his charming picture of the Beckford children
by the same artist. This sale also took place-
at Christie’s, as did another so long ago as
1807, when a Romney, now in the Wallace
collection, Avas passed in at 19 guineas! In
three years this remarkable picture of the
famous Mrs. Robinson as “Perdita” had in-
creased in value exactly 215.; it Avas snapped
up for 20 guineas in 1810 by the second
Marquis of Hertford, and now hangs side by
side Avith the “Perdita” of Reynolds and
Gainsborough. It would be a difficult job to
place a price on it noiv, but it is safe to say
that there is no fear of the Wallace collec-
tion losing money on it.

“Lex”: According to a Sydney Sun cable
(13/11Y9) Father (Major) O’Donnell,
during the taking of the Summary in con-
nection with the charge of using seditious
language in Dublin, “quoted King’s regula-
tions, that even should the evidence be in-
sufficient to warrant further proceedings he
Avas entitled to a court-martial in the
interests of truth.” There is nothing in the
King’s Regs, to support such a claim. An
officer has no right whatever to
demand a court-martial, though
scores have fought for one. The
point was finally established by
the English Courts in the case
of Dawkins v. Rokeby, where
Colonel Dawkins pursued his
general, Lord Rokeby, right up
the legal ladder and lost. Lord
Lucan, the someone who blun-
dered at Balaclava, also
struggled hard for a court-mar-
tial on being returned to Eng-
land as inefficient, but he never
got it. A private soldier has a
sort of a right to a D.C.M.
That is to say, he can claim to
go before a D.C.M. in prefer-
ence to being dealt with by his
C.O. The right is exercised
chiefly by men who have severe
C.O.’s or who, while old
offenders, know that the case
against them on the Sum-
mary is weak. They then get
two chances: (1) That H.Q.
may throw the case out before
it comes to trial; (2) that a
strange Court, finding purely on
the evidence, may acquit. The
ordinary military Court, which
knows its man, finds on almost anything
but the evidence. It is often a matter of
the prisoner’s notorious iaxity in saluting
or of his custom of wearing dirty boots.

“P.X.” : Pickles, one of Australia's, most
experienced airmen, after making a leisurely
flight from Sydney to Broken Hill, set out
bright and early one morning to do the 600
miles home that day. Inside an hour
he discovered that Australia, said (mostly
by those who don’t know much about the
interior) to be the airman’s paradise, has
its difficulties, too. For one thing, this con-
tinent has no wind-shields to speak of; and
a raging gale is apt to blow in the same
direction for days on end, only letting down
at nights when flying is practically impos-
sible. Present writer has seen a fence being
built just outside Menindie, where Pickles
had to descend within an hour or so of
leaving Broken Hill; and 10 days later he
drove over the top wire—a steady week’s
gale had banked the sand till only the tips
of the posts were visible. Of Australian
long-distance flights so far attempted I
should say that less than one-half have been
successes, and I can recall at least four in-
stances in which, as in Pickles’ case, the
airman reached home by train.

“Tin Hat”: Joe Flanagan had been to
Cairo for one day’s leave and 50 drinks. He
arrived back in Tel-el-Ivebir about dusk.
Staggering across the lines he heard a
STILL HOPEFUL.
MRS. BIGGS (period about 1950): “Oh,
dear, dear, James, then we haven’t saved
a shilling! Poor Jane will be penniless
when we are gone.”
MR. BIGGS ( ex-Digger ): “Penniless! Not
exactly, Amelia. There'll be my War
Gratuity Bonds, you know.”
whistle, and looking round saw the officers’
mess-hut rise a couple of feet into the air,
wobble for a second, then come straight at
him on 300 legs. With a wild yell he rushed
into our tent, upset the stew and crawled
under the blankets. Going outside, we our-
selves were somewhat staggered by the sight
of a large hut walking across the parade-
ground. Following up, we found that the
officers had decided to shift their dining-
room—a big barn-like affair without a floor.
They had shoved a few joists under it and
filled it with Diggers, who, on a blast of a
whistle, straightened their backs and moved
off with it to its new site.
*- ■* * *
“Hermish” : Four Diggers were having a
game of poker at the Soldiers’ Lounge, when
the rare wowser arrived on the scene.
Noticing a few coins on the table, he
observed, “Hope you’re not gambling, boys?”
“Oh, no,” remarked one of the quartette,
“we’re making a bit of a collection for the
troops’ tobacco fund. Anything doin’?” The
visitor reluctantly dredged up a bob and
left. And at once the cards were shuffled to
“cut” for the holy shilling.
* * * *
“Snob”: I had a glimpse of the real
thing on Oaks Day. The lady was superbly
dressed, and was at no pains to disguise
the fact that hosiery troubled her no more.
Her shoes were an almost golden tan, run-
ning a little high up the shin, and well up
the calf, but cut away around the ankle;
and her legs were superbly decorated with
what looked like dainty water-color sketches,
taking in the ankle, which was surmounted
with a briar-rose. The dado or frieze occu-
pied the place the clock takes up in a stock-
ing. I do not know how far it was carried,
but felt some satisfaction in a new field for
Australian decorative art, until I saw that
the thing was nothing but a “transfer.”
You simply float the transfer a moment in
hot water and dab it on your own pedals, no
instruction in applied art being necessary.
The youthful Direct Actionists of Mel-
bourne are better shots or have worse luck
than their grown-up exemplars. A couple
of members of the Collingwood “Little
Campbells” lately chased one of the Fitzroy
“Roses,” with whom they have a vendetta,
into a blind lane and poured four bullets
into him. He died a day later. As all three
vendettists were under 16 the Law hardly
knows what to do about it. So far the
nippers in the infants’ classes haven’t taken
shooters to school with them, but some of
the lady teachers get an anxious look if
little Billy ducks his hand round to the seat
of his pants when threatened with the strap.
“Mother’s Pet” : “Nugget” had been with
the regiment from the first, and was its cham-
pion legpuller. When a fresh batch of rein-
forcements arrived he \yould stroll up to the
simplest-looking of them and whisper con-
fidingly that he suspected a chap of being
a German spy. If the newchum would
help him they would follow the suspect, and
see if he really was
in Fritz’s pay. Nug-
get would then point
out the most harm-
less chap in the
regiment, and for the
next few days the
sleuths would follow
him closely. Nugget
would then dro« out
saying he Avanted
the other man to get
all the credit. Some-
times the lunatic
assistant would track
his intended victim
for a week or more
—generally until he
was assaulted. But
Nugget was com-
pelled to give up the
sport when one of
his pupil-detectives
saw the quarry try
to break leave by
sneaking thi’ough the
horse lines. The spy-
hunter thought his
n].an was trying to
escape, and fired a
shot over his head,
at the same time
calling on him t>
stop. When * things
had quietened down
again and all the
horses Avere tethered,
the horse-guard (most of whom had been
lamed by horses standing on their toes)
dipped the patriotic sleuth in the horse-
trough.
* * * *
“Snell”: One Melbourne bookie, a dark-
eyed, piratical Hebrew, works himself
apparently into a terrific state of excitement.
Ilis emotion is particularly overpowering
when he is paying out, which he does to a
running comment, sotto voce, but loud enough
for everyone in the vicinity to hear. “There
go Bella’s furs.... Good G —d, I’m ruined.
.. . .I’m done! Another fifteen quid.. . .Oh- -
fifty! That’s Bella’s diamond ring.... Lord
help us, twenty ! There goes Bella’s hat!. .. .
Eighteen quid and a half. Bella’s done in
for her boots !. . .. Here, take it —it’s Bella’s
bracelet!” It had been a good day for the
bagmen, and a speculator rolled up just after
a rank outsider had come home. “There.”
he said, “here’s me bottom quid on Trip
Hammer, and I hope to Gord Bella's satis-
fied at last!”
A SERIOUS MATTER.
“Oh, blow! What if it is your twenty-first
birthday? Yon needn’t sit moping about
it. Come and play!”
“My dear, you are young and don’t realise
that I have to decide now whether it’s to
be Mr. Hughes or Mr. Ryan.”
“Y.Z.” : I saw one innovation at Fleming,-
ton this season. It was introduced by an
enterprising small boy who, armed with a
cloth and a pad, went about among the
people on the lawn, rubbing the dust off their
boots. He did not apply for the job, but
plumped down in front of the dust-laden
brogues, and slicked them up, trusting to
native generosity for reward. He struck a
good reef all right.

DROUGHT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.
I heard the long trains crying in the night
With groans of. pain between their distant wailing.
It seemed as if, in heavy-laden flight,
The spirit of the land, pain-spent and ailing,
Went by in shadows of a waning moon.
There came a murmur in the nearer trees,
A fitful sobbing and a weary sighing.
The low wind whispered as a friend that grieves
“The great north-west in agony is dying—
Dying of summer and the burning noon.”
The trains, were groaning as they topped the rise;
I heard the clanking of their iron chaining.
The slow' and panting engine’s glaring eyes
Seemed haggard in the dark with monstrous strain-
ing—
Slow wheels against a continent of death!
Fodder for dying creatures ! Ghostly things
Moved o’er a scorched land in the moonset gleam-
ing—
Processions of despair by perished springs,
Thirst-maddened skeletons of herds still dreaming
Of the sweet wind with raindrops in its breath.
I hear the long trains wailing in the night.
Oh, iron wheels too slowly northward turning,
The carrion-birds are swifter in their flight.
By the hot soul of flame within you burning,
Speed on, great engines to lean Hunger’s gate!
Your voice is as an echo of the cry
Of beasts that perish ere the hot morn’s breaking.
Surely your wheels are kinder than the sky;
Your furnace-blast no trust of man forsaking
Flares roaring challenge to the call “Too late!”
N.S.W.

Then you have music faultlessly reproduced,
rich and clear in tone, bringing a wealth of
musical enjoyment hitherto believed impossible.
HE popularity and success of the Vocalion is due to the superiority
and effectiveness of its patented features, the ingenious inventions
and practical improvements that combine to make it the greatest
of all Phonographs. These exclusive advantages include :
The Reproducer
Constructed with utmost precision, the Vocalion reproduces
everv sound-wave with life-like fidelity. Its diaphragm,
sensitive to even a breath and the heavy vibration of a full
military band, creates all tones with sweetness and faithful
quality.
The Graduola
This important and revolutionary tone-controlling device
immediately places all other Phonographs at a disadvantage,
for no other can offer such a privilege of playing a record
yourself with shade of expression and tone color that
your musical feeling dictates.
The Tone Chamber
After much experimenting by acoustic scientists, this
highly-improved feature was designed, embodying a system
of tensionised wood and metal resonators, from which the tone
produced is unapproached for characteristic quality and
natural color.
The Automatic Stop
is a mechanical advantage allowing anyone to enjoy the
record from start to finish, undisturbed.

“D.E.A.”: When the battalion was at
Flers in 191 G a sudden demand arose for
poeket-Bibles. I heard the delighted Y-
Emma telling the sceptical padre about it
one evening in the mess. The battalion was
“going in” the next night, and 23 Diggers
had each, it seemed, applied for a Bible; and
the Q.M.S., hitherto regarded as a i'um-
slinger and a reprobate, had requisitioned for
a couple of dozen, as men were asking for
them at his store. About a week later I
was in an advanced company H.Q. waiting
for a ’phone message, when a Digger lifted
up the waterproof sheet forming the door
and asked the orderly for a “zig-zag.” His
pal handed him a much-reduced pocket-
Testament. Then I understood the hunger
for the Word. Cigarettes had been on short
issue for some time, but there was a fair
supply of tobacco.
■*•***
“Emanco”: I was among the first batch
of Australians to go to France via the
Panama Canal. Thirteen days’ leave was
handed to us in New York, and we were
most hospitably treated. Coming out of the
Knickerbocker with two cobbers on the last
night ashore, we looked round for a car to
deliver us at the wharf. Many fine motors
showing no outward indication that they can
be temporarily “bought” are employed in
the passenger service, so we just bowled up
to a man we saw standing beside a big
tourer and asked him to run us down. He
took the job and soon did the journey—usual
fare, half a dollar. A one-dollar bill was
all we had, so I presented it. “Well, boys,”
he said, “I guess this is the first real money
I ever earned, and I’ll keep it as a memento.”
Then he handed over his card—
J. K. Vanderbilt, Junior,
and drove away. Some day I’ll write and
ask him for the change.
“Optic”: According to cables the use of
monocles by fashionable women is all the
rage in London. The habit is, at any rate,
NOT SO—ER—AFTER ALL.
F AY: “I saw a photograph of you the other
day, and it was so like you I kissed it.”
R AY: “And did it — er — reciprocate?"
F AY: “No, of course it didn’t."
R AY: “Then I’m afraid it wasn’t so much
— er!"
better than the one that the myopic young
woman of Australia has fallen into. She
says that glasses of any kind make her look
too old, and refuses to wear them, even when
they are urgently ordered by the ophthalmic-
surgeon. She tries to make up for the
defect in her distant vision by screwing up
her eyes. Thereby she certainly cuts off
peripheral rays of light and gets better
images, but she is hopelessly handicapped,
though her absurd vanity won’t permit her
to acknowledge it. A monocle with the
proper minus correction would be better
than no glass at all, and if stuck in right
during a promenade on the Block would
not only attract attention but might prevent
the lady from missing any glad-eyes that
were going.
“Slop Chest” : Lower George-street, Sydney,
is the place where drifting sailors —the blue-
water men, the dipsy men, the men from God-
knows-where-and-back - again occasionally
meet a shipmate. Two of these nobles of
the stinking fo’c’s’le met this morning.
“Good Gord!” said both. “Where the” (skip
this) “you been? You old son” (prayers
for those at sea here). “The last
time I saw you, you was”—long yarn fol-
lows. Drinks called for, and as Peter swung
his pot lie said; “Well, you old” (etc.), “they
told me y’ was dead. It must have bin a
• lie.”
“Naming” : The affable Chow who visits
city offices selling feather-dusters blew into
our place, and had invaded the Hebrew
chief's office before he could be gagged.
“Ullo, Georgie,” he greeted the magnate,
“you likem dustier, welly cheap! ’Alf a
clown shop sellem. Too de-ar. Fifteen pen’.
Me”- - “Get out,” roared the potentate.
The visitor rambled on till the other
screamed, in a voice that threatened sack to
us all : “Get to Hell, you heathen!”
Ah Swish went to the door. Holding it
open, “Ha, you too welly smart,” he said.
“Who hill Klif” And bolted.
*•*-**
“Bozzer B.”: Towards the end of 1017
my cobbers and I for several weeks occu-
pied a hut at Reninghelst, well back from the
line. We left this good home for Ypres; and
next day, when I called to collect some gear,
the hut had disappeared, and an immense
shellhole had taken its place. We moved from
Ypres, and the same thing happened there —
a few hours afterwards our little abode was
blown to the stars. Then came peace—and
one of the lucky crowd was promptly killed
by a motor-car. Perhaps I shall break my
neck at bowls.
“Old Timer”: Fifty years ago Woollalira
Point was one of the most picturesque spots
on the foreshores of Sydney Harbor, and Dan
Cooper (owner of Sydney’s then large'ct
warehouse, Waterloo Stores, at the corner
of George and Market streets) spent his cash
liberally on the mansion he began to build
there and never finished. The grounds occu-
pied about 100 acres, and to-day the area is
thickly studded with
modern villas which have
obliterated the original
charm. In those days the
enormous terraces and
thousands of 12-foot wide
stone steps evidenced the
galling cruelty of the old
regime. Residents nowa-
days do not worry about
the sorrows of the con-
victs who cursed ani
slaved there, nor the
blood-curdling corrob-
orees the niggers indulged
in under the inspiration
of old-time rum. Cap-
tain Bobbie Towns then
owned Cran brook, until
recently the State Gover-
nor’s residence. Towns
traded in Kanakas, which
he recruited in his own
schooners, and his island
live-stock camped in
Cranbrook grounds while
awaiting transhipment to
Queensland. It was when
they raided the nearby
local niggers’ camp that
the chips began to fly,
and if coon ghosts walk
the earth Bellevue Hill
aristocracy must have
some hair-raising experi-
ences o’ nights. The local
abos. swarmed on the
edges of Woollahra Point
and Rose Bay, and Dan
Cooper and the late W. B. Dailey treated
them with great kindness. In return the
darkies never failed to see that their two
friends lived well on fish and oysters.

A physician on the subject of nurses’
evidence: —•
The statement that Georgeson had left Lister
private hospital for his home led the N. S. Wales
Wheat Inquiry Commission to decide on calling the
nurse as a witness. I cannot remember a nurse being
thus interrogated concerning the bodily or mental
condition of a patient still under medical observation
and treatment. The nurse is not concerned with the
diagnosis of a diseased condition of mind or body,
but has to carry out the instructions of the medical
attendant, or see that they are carried out. She is
not supposed to know anything about the treatment,
and should not know anything about the patient’s
visitors, if he has any, as she ought to be out of the
room at visiting time. The things the nurse would
know, such as the temperature, pulse rate, respira-
tion, inclination to talk or answer questions, or the
GREED.
“I was afraid you’d seen too much of me—jazzing all the winter."
"Never! I’m hoping to see some more of you—surfing all the summer.
reverse, sleeplessness, irritability or placidity of
temperament, would have no bearing on the patient’s
mentality or the defects in his memory impressions.
Years of hard study would be necessary before even
a doctor’s opinion would have any weight in such
cases. If the Commission were still in doubt about
the patient’s condition it should have had the
patient examined by other consulting physicians. If
a particularly obscure point of law arises upon
which the Full Court cannot agree, will their
Honors, instead of calling in other trained men,
bring in the constable —even the Inspector-General
of Police —who administers the law?
“Fed Up”: The Digger who doesn’t keep
his discharge handy is liable to hit trouble.
This happened in Melbourne last week.
Fritz's machine-gun bullet sent Pte. Cart-
ridge home after serving '1036 days abroad.
He re-enlisted in A.M. Corps for sea-trans-
port service. After 35 days in camp
he was discharged with .others in August.
1918; but, thinking the second discharge of
no consequence, lie didn’t pick it up. Going
out to lunch 15 months after, he was appre-
hended by military police on a charge of
desertion from H.M. Forces for 456 days,
being the period from the date of discharge
to the date of arrest. It was a hot day, and
for an hour and a half he sweated in clink.
He was then exhibited to the assistant
provost-marshal and detained pending court-
martial. Then the fossil-excavators in the
Department did a little work, the discharge
was unearthed duly filled in as at August 1,
1918, and the prisoner was released with an
empty stomach and a mouth full of curses.
» * * *
“Lance-G.”: Mrs. Digger (fate ’Awkins)
had been notified that she had been allotted
to a boat-roll for the voyage to Australia.
This is what came to Horseferry-road in
reply:—
Sir,: —I am righting just a few lines. I want to
know what a Boat Roll is, why is it I can’t go on
a Family Ship ? I don’t mind a Boat Roll iff it is
all right. His it a big boat or what because I have
got a big trunk I don’t want to go in anything
mind.
Yet who could help sympathising with the
lady? In order to make you (who pay the
piper) believe that war is a thing you don’t
and couldn’t possibly understand, the mili-
tary caste has developed an almost unintel-
ligible jargon. It’s merely a part of a
huge conspiracy of humbug.
* * * *
“Rio”: Those who object to Chauvel being
styled a brilliant cavalry leader, because he
did not personally lead a unit in action, put
a very narrow meaning to the term “leader.”
Very few occasions occur on which com-
manders above the rank of brigadier get a
chance to lead personally. How often did
Napoleon actually lead in action after Ar-
eola? Or Wellington after Assaye? When
did Foch last command in the firing-line?
It is almost always wiser for the commander
of a large force to be somewhere in rear
where he is not likely to be distracted by or
to attach undue importance to events happen-
ing in his immediate vicinity, and w'here
reports of remote doings can more easily
reach him. Napoleon said: “In war
men are nothing, a man is everything. It
was not the Roman Army conquered Gaul,
but Caesar. It was not the Carthaginians
made Rome tremble, but Hannibal. It
was not the Macedonians reached the Indus,
but Alexander.” There was no leadership
at Anzac, and though men could not do
more what was the result? So all the good
leading in Egypt and Palestine by popular
commanders like Ryrie would have been
useless had Chauvel’s dispositions as corps
commander been faulty. The general un-
satisfactoriness of this war to the military
student—the expenditure of such colossal
man-power with such little result —seems to
be due to the fact that “a man” was not
forthcoming, though the improvement in
Europe after Foch took supreme command
and in Palestine after Allenby’s arrival is
patent to everybody.
* * * *
“Vandorian” : After reaching Southampton
from New York, I spent a few weeks in
those parts, in a mediaeval village, Brocken-
hurst, on the edge of the New Forest. I
noticed—you couldn’t help noticing—that a
ACCEPTED WITHOUT ARGUMENT.
No. 1: “I should like to see the man that I’d
promise to love, honor and obey."
No. 2: “I dare say you would, dear."
very modern drainpipe was still regarded as a
curiosity by the geese who picked up their
living on the common. The innovation, I
found, was called “The King’s Drain.”
When two big buildings close by were being
turned into hospitals for Maoriland wounded,
George Rex tva.s invited to inspect. He
asked some pointed questions about the
drainage, and this little bit of modern sani-
tation was the result of his sniffs. A
homely little man is George!
THE MAN WHO NEEDS A CHEER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.
Since cave-men fought in the dawn of Time
With flints discreetly hurled,
To lose in a fight’s been worse than crime
In the eyes of a cold, hard world.
The world’s best smile since things began—
A smile serene and bright—-
Has shone on the most successful man,
And the upper dog in a fight.
But though this law has long prevailed,
Our sympathies are broad;
They go to the bloke who tried but failed,
And the dog that got most chawed.

“Sandfly”: Bixl the Hangman, who died
up in the North a while ago, got his name this way.
Nearly 30 years ago, during the reign of Dr.
Macgregor in British New Guinea, Bill and I were
working aboard the Merrie England. A batch of
natives who had committed murders were sentenced
tc be hanged, but difficulty arose about hang-
man. Five pounds a neck was offered, but there
were no takers. “How many yer got ter hang?”
queried Bill at last. “Eight,” was the reply. Bill
dropped the caulking tools and, turning to me, said,
“I 11 git ther day off and go up and fix ’em.” We
both got the day’s leave, and Bill secured the job.
The gallows was arranged under a shady tree, a rope
hanging from a limb directly over two empty beer
cases. About 60 natives of the village were con-
scripted to attend the object-lesson. The prisoners
were marched up in chains. Bill took possession of
the first, and placing him on top of the cases,
climbed the ladder, adjusted the rope, and awaited
orders. The Riot Act, as Bill called it, was then
read, and he followed it by kicking the cases away.
The nigs who were watching simply writhed with
laughter, and when told to take the nig down and
bury him refused, and would not believe him to be
dead. The sergeant then announced that only one
a day would be hanged, and that Bill’s services
would not be required until 10 o’clock next morning.
Bill fleev off the handle, and the sergeant tried to
explain something, but Bill was obstinate. He ig-
nored the statement that £5 a day wasn’t bad
going, and, putting his coat on, declared his services
as hangman “off.” “Well, wait a bit,” said the
sergeant, “and I’ll speak to his Excellency.” On
Beturning he told Bill he could go ahead with the
rest. After Bill had thrown the bodies all in a
heap, “Now' what about the cheque?” he demanded.
“Come up to-morrow and sign the voucher and you’ll
get it.” “More damn humbug!” growled Bill as
he and I walked away.

‘TVlulga”: While we’re discussing buck-
jump riders, let me introduce George Lawton, of
(hinchilla and Taroom, Southern Queensland. He
was considered by many experienced men a few
years back to be the best rough-rider in Australia.
For dare-devil riding, scrub-dashing and stock work,
lie and his brother Ted have probably never been
equalled. Another brother, Jim, was the best I
e\ei saw at handling and breaking in young horses.
Bob Law'ton would go fearlessly into a cattle-yard
on foot and throw any beast that charged him
in the most casual manner. And still another of
the family, Tom, threw and tied a bullock in
record time at Toowoomba Showgrounds. 1 think
the record still stands. While discussing well-known
riding celebrities round the camp-fire one evening,
the boss, Bill Rose, gave it as his opinion that
Tom Lawton was the best all-round rider and cattle-
man he had seen, and as Rose had travelled prac-
tically every stock route and knew every cattle-
run worth know'ing in the Commonwealth, nobody
contradicted him.

“Mrs, Lance Rawson”: In 1869 or ’7O a
young Scotch new-chum came to the Upper Bur-
nett (Q.). He was a great favorite and a plucky
lad, but he had a horror of snakes and could be
scared green if a dead one
was thrown at him. One
day he had been in to the
township for the mail and
came back fairly “full”
and went to bed. One of
the boys had that day
killed a six-foot black
snake, and by way of a
joke it was hung from the
cross-beam above the bed,
so that the head just came
on a level with Mae’s face.
Next morning Mac was
found dead, his eyes dis-
tended with terror and
fixed upon the snake. The
affair was hushed up. That
the young man had a weak
heart was just one of those
little things the jokers had
never thought about, and
as a consequence one man
has gone sorrowing all his
life. On the Upper Burnett
for many years there was
never a practical joke
played on anybody.
“Pitcheri” : My whole life practically has
been spent in educating sheep-dogs. When a pup is
six or eight weeks old break him (or her) to the
chain. At four months take a rope (clothes line),
fasten to the pup’s collar, and get him to sit down,
first by word of mouth, and following upon that by
a. sharp jerk of the rone. When the pupil has this
part of the lesson easy, use your hand as a signal,
and from that work with a whistle. If you can’t
whistle naturally buy a railway 'whistle. Once you
have the pup obedient to the signal he’s yours.
One of the chief failures in sheep-dogs is lack of
immediate control. AA’hen teaching a pup to “go
away ’ never let him go or come back between you
and the sheep. Above all, keep him away from an
old dog. I’ll give you my reasons privately. Feed
the pup yourself, let no one else work or check
h;m; and never beat him except with your tongue.
“Kooragai” : “Bill Bowyang’s” golianna (B.
23/10/’l9) which measured sft. 2in. was only a
midget. The common length of the lace lizard
is 6ft. to 7ft. The species was very numerous on
Richmond River (N.S.AV.) a few years ago, and a
dozen big fellows were often seen round a dead
beast. The largest species is V. salvator, of the Far
North. A fair specimen, measured from tip of tail
to snout, would tape Bft. Measured from snout to
tip of tail the same specimen would go like the
Devil.
“S. S. Severn” : The expert cannibal who
informed “Doliori” (B. 30/10/’l9) that, though
human flesh is very nice it is rather salt, Ss not
altogether supported by my priceless old friend Rahu,
of New Guinea. He agrees that roast man is a bit
on the salt side, but declares that grilled woman is
not so salt, and her flesh is softer. Baby-meat, he
tells me, tastes like baked banana. But Chinaman's
flesh he reckons best of all—-“close-up pig.” I
knew a white man, now lying with so many splen-
WHEN THE SLEEPER WOKE.
“Oh. Mrs. Clubb, I ’ad sich a scare in the
night! I was awakened by ’caring a loud
crashing noise. I struck a match; and
the first thing I saw was a man’s legs
stickin’ out from under the bed.”
“Oh, dear, it teas the burglar!”
“No, my dear, it was me 'usband. ’E ’ad
'card the noise, too!”
did comrades of the Papuan Police Service some-
where on the Western Front, who, while patrolling
the Western Division of the Possession, was invited
to a big feast at a certain Goaribari village. The
chiefs gave him a warm welcome, and bade him join
in a big feast that was in progress. They ex-
plained the dishes. This in the great wooden cook-
ing bowl was pig; that, pigeon; the oval pot over
the fire held maigani stewed with sago. Months
later one of his native police boys told him that
part of the feast was human flesh, though he wasn't
sure which bowl contained it. A team of Goaribari
boys recruited for work on a Central Division plan-
tation, though well fed with plenty of good tucker,
fell away in health. Many of them developed a hor-
rible disease, which affected the jawbone and flesh of
the face. The head native hospital-orderly explained
to me that they got that “big sick’’ because they
had no man-flesh now. Some villages boil their
victims, some bake them ; some roast ’em. The chefs
that roast have a contempt for the other cooks.
Smart society wliich roasts wears a smoked hand
strung on a string of human hair around its neck.
“Cape Pork” : The best remedy I have met
for worms in horses is an ordinary knob of washing
blue powdered up and put into the feed-bag. No
horse will object, and I have never known it to fail.

Walter Hawker, of the South Aus. squat-
ting family, tells how lie kills rabbits per motor-
car exhaust fumes:—-
Remove the silencer and fit on a piece of lj-in.
pipe with a reducing socket and a water-pipe union,
get 30ft. of 1-in. bore hose, go to a burrow the up-
wind side, face the car to the wind, put the hose
into the burrow in the most up-wind hole, and fill
that hole up with dirt. As the smoke comes out of
the other holes fill in till all are packed. If a
large burrow, run the car for five minutes, when
every rabbit will be killed. I worked the car for
six hours for a consumption of two gallons of
petrol, and fumigated 17 large burrows. These
would have taken seven men eight days to dig out.
I reckon that one day’s work saved £2O at least,
as the seven diggers and one cook at £2 2s. a
week, one boss at £4 a week, and feed for nine
men at 17s. a week comes to £2B 9s. a week.
Deduct the cost of petrol, oil, wear and tear, and
two men to fumigate, you will get an easy saving
of £lO, and the rabbits are killed so much quicker.
“Dido”: Sheepshanks, senior, held about
5000 acres at Winbiddie, and was a big,
slovenly, silent man who made no friends and per-
mitted his womenfolk to make none. His immediate
household when he arrived consisted of Mrs. Sheep l
shanks, a long, bonj', thin-lipped dame; little Wally
Sheepshanks, then a boy of seven; and Ann Sheep-
shanks. Ann was not really a Sheepshanks at all,
being' merely the woman
of all work, a bent, oldish-
young woman, grey-faced
and speechless, who went
through life as subservient
to big Dan Sheepshanks as
if she had been a bought-
and-branded slave; but
the neighbors, following a
custom, dubbed her Sheep-
shanks too. When the
Sheepshanks family had
been there 20 years, Win-
biddie knew no more of
them than it had gathered
in the first 20 days. AVally
grew up so like the old
man that when the latter
died, after 20 years of con-
stant work and wearing
frugality, nobody seemed
to miss him. After another
two years Mrs. Sheepshanks
died, and only Wally and
old Ann were left, the
latter much more bent,
than formerly, but still
drifting about with aver-
ted face, doing the hardest
and dirtiest work of the
place. Ann now lived in
a wretched little hovel of
a place next the barn, and
fed on the scraps from the
table of AVally Sheep-
shanks, and Wally was a
man who made few scraps.
One day Crompton, a
neighbor and a man after
Wally’s own heart, put it
to Sheepshanks that he
was a fool to keep old Ann
about the place. “She’s
little good for work now,”
he said, “and she is no
credit to you. I’d send
her packing to the Benev-
’lent.” AVally shook his
head. “No,” he said vir-
tuously. “I can’t do that. There’s such a thing as
natural feelin’ and filia-l duty.” “Filihl duty?”
ejaculated Crompton. “Yes,” said Wally Sheep-
shanks, “it appears she’s my real mother!”

Azac”: Night-prowling snakes, though
not common, mooch about after hours in the
Monaro, Richmond River and Goulburn districts
(N.S.AV.). People of a fanciful nature know the
freak as the moon-snake. Also, it is occasionally called
the red tiger-snake, and the brown treeusnake. It
is almost entirely nocturnal in habit, which fact
accounts for its being rarely seen. The reptile is
very savage, but it is non-venomous, although,
strange to say, it has grooved teeth li'ka the

THE VISITORS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Last week, when 1 was very ill,
And blocks of ice were round my head,
There were seme visitors that came
And grouped themselves about my bed.
’Twas sundown when they sauntered in—
Just when those eerie shadows creep—
And I was lying dozing there,
Not quite awake, nor yet asleep.
And some were old, and some were young,
And some were wizened up and bent ;
They wanted cash for goods supplied,
And some were after money ler.t;
Although the room was sweltering,
1 felt my blood was running cold,
As silently they crowded in,
The ghosts of creditors of old.
’Twas then a toothless hag spoke up:
“Yer thort yer ’ad me on a string
To wash yer rags fer seven weeks ;
An’ then yer ducked, yer lousy thing!”
Then eame the barmaid from the Soak,
AVith faded cheek and tearful grin;
She threw a dirty glass at me
And yelled: “Yer cow, yer done me in!”
A woman with a glaring eye—
She had a jaw of toughened steel—
AVho owned the place where once I stayed,
Next swore I beat her for a meal.
I’d ate her out of House and home;
I’d lined my ribs, then sneaked away;
I’d robbed her hungry, orphaned kids,
But now she meant to make me pay.
The German Jew that kept the shop
AA r here I had got some clothes on tick
Declared “Dem togs vas goot an’ cheap—
I tink you played a dirty trick.
But. now perhaps you von’t live long;
I always said you vas a toff,
Don’d mind dose udder beople here;
A'oust try an’ pay a leedle off.”
DISTINCTLY CON YA DESCENT.
ORDERLY: “Could you cat an egg?”
BILL: “Could I eat an egg? Could I cat
the hen that laid it!”
Last came a mate of other days,
And he was big and broad and fine;
lie seemed to guess what were my thoughts
And said: “Forget that quid of mine.
A quid is neither here nor there;
You’ll do as much for me some day.”
He fumbled something on my bunk,
And then he seemed to fade away.
But all the rest were mocking me,
And some were tearing at my neck,
And some were beating at my head ;
I heard them say: “AVe’ll take your cheque”
And then I saw the lights were on,
The nurses there in dainty caps....
“He’s quiet now, but very hot;
Wo might, perhaps, undo the straps.”

Two Mew Novels
by Australian Authors.
Is. each. Is. l£d. posted.
“A Game of Chance.”
By ARTHUR WRIGHT.
Mr. Arthur Wright is rapidly becoming the Commonwealth’s most popular author.
He already has the following novels to his credit: —
“IN THE LAST STRIDE.” “GAMBLER’S GOLD.”
“THE SPORT FROM HOLLOWLOG FLAT.”
“RUNG IN.” “A ROGUE’S LUCK.”
“THE BREED HOLDS GOOD.”
“OVER THE ODDS.” “UNDER A CLOUD.”
“WHEN NUGGETS GLISTENED.”
“THE HATE OF A HUN.” “THE OUTLAW’S DAUGHTER.”
Every one of these novels has been an instantaneous success. Like most of
his other stories, Mr. Wright’s latest, “A Game of Chance,” is strong in sporting
interest. It is a story of a daring attempt at impersonation. A Digger returns
to Aussie to discover that the Far-West station which was left to him while he
was on service has been wrested from him by an impostor. The thrilling experiences
of the Digger in establishing his claim make an intensely interesting volume.
“The Skipper of the ‘Roaring Meg.’”
By JACK McLaren.
This is a great story of the Coral Seas by the author of ‘‘Red Mountain,
the Northern Australian novel which made a big hit when published a few months
ago. Billy Certain, master-mariner, on his way to a rich bSche-de-mer fishing-
ground, falls in with a dying trader on the Papuan coast. The latter makes a will
appointing Certain guardian of his seventeen-year-old half-caste daughter. No
white man was ever left a more embarrassing legacy than this half-savage beauty.
“The Skipper of the Roaring Meg” is one of the best novels of the year.

“McNorth” : Torres Strait had its Sam-
son, too. In the days when fishes talked and birds
had prehensile teeth, there lived on the island of
Maubiag one Kwoiam, a man of great height and
the strength of ten. He was a fighter who had a
habit of wiping out whole villages, and had obliter-
ated various expeditions sent to subdue him. The
terror of Maubiag, from his stone fort he defied
the Strait. For some not-clearly-defined reason he
slaughtered his mother by cutting off her head.
Perhaps she was a Delilah in maternal disguise and
cut off his hair, and he was retaliating. Anyway, it
was not long afterwards that the crowd got him,
and the natives of Maubaig to this day will show
the interested traveller the remains of Ivwoiam’s
rampart with the walls he scattered as he fell. Near
by is the giant’s alleged grave, with certain bushes
whose leaves are red-splashed at the place where
his life-blood dripped. His mother's head turned
into stone and now forms the base of the concrete
pillar that supports the baptismal font of clam-
shell in the Maubiag Mission Church —a font that is
a strange mixture of natural history, modern civil-
isation and savage mythology.
* * * *
“Pick”: The blind-snake or slow-worin
mentioned recently on the Abo. page, is our worst
example of degeneracy. Once a surface-dweller, he
was then possibly as vigorous and business-like as
other reptiles of his rank and inches; but, pre-
sumably to avoid enemies, he, in the unreachable
past, adopted a subterranean mode of existence, where
altered conditions caused many parts of his anatomy
to become atrophied by disuse. His eyes, formerly
bright and black orbs, but now entirely shielded by
scales, are no longer able to distinguish anything
except light from darkness. His mouth, now fang-
less and almost toothless, no longer exercised in
snapping his prey or biting his foes, has become in-
capable of expansion further than to admit the
termites or other tiny insects on which he feeds.
His scales, which once were a means of pro-
tection and progression, are now smoothed to a
faint outline on a tender, glossy skin, and his tail
has shrunk to a thorn-like projection almost undis-
tinguishable from the head. With this spine the
slow-worm anchors his rear as he shuffles his body
forward. In some specimens, however, the vestiges
of hind legs hidden beneath the skin appear to in-
dicate that the squirmer has changed his mind about
becoming a complete worm.
* * * *
“Johnno”: Up on Prince of Wales Island
a while ago some old coins were dug from the sand.
One of these, bearing cabalistic marks, said to be
Arabian, found its way to a colored resident of
Thursday Island, just across the water, who re-
garded it as having come straight from Mahomet,
and possessed of much virtue. Consequently, when his
child fell sick, he took the piece of silver, immersed
it in a cup of water, and gave the wash to the
patient. And still the youngster died.

“Emanco” : This is a reliable remedy for
distemper: fib. flowers of sulphur, 141 b. dripping;
knead together and form into convenient-sized balls.
Have the dog hungry and administer the lot in one
dose. Many dogs recovering from the disease under
other treatment are left with twitching jaws, but
the above recipe will leave the sufferer with a strong
enough jaw to get him into Parliament.
THE BALANCER.
BARRISTER: “ What’s your occupation?”
HOSTILE WITNESS: “I’m an accountant, cashier and acrobat."
BARRISITER: “ What’s that?”
HOSTILE WITNESS: “Well, I’m a tram conductor.”
“Delhi”: “Sassafras” (B. • 16/10/’I9V
states that yellow box will not turn or gap an.
axe if cut on an up-and-down stroke. I would like
to see him cut a large specimen by that method. I
would also like to know the difference the stroke
makes on a gritty tree like the yellow box. “Sassa-
fras ’ also enters pine knots in the axe-breaking com-
petition. Has he ever met with the red carobbean?
That vegetable will turn and gap any axe put
into it whatever he the nationality of the iron-
mongery or whatever stroke is used. If ‘'Sassafras”
cares to become better acquainted with the red
bea n let him apply to the Dorrigo scrub.
“Mulga”: Owing to the long drought many
of the waterholcs in the creeks and rivers of Southern
Queensland have gone dry, and stockowners are
wearing a very worried look. Where there are creeks
with sandy bottoms, such as the Maranoa, the diffi-
culty has been temporarily overcome by digging
soakage “wells.” I saw one on a selection at Sandy
Creek, near Miles, the other day. It measured about
3Cft. long, sft wide and 4ft. deep. The owner
had slabbed it, and he told me he was watering
over 100 head of stock daily and then didn’t exhaust it.
“Doxite”: It would be interesting to know
where the receivers of ’possum skins hang out in
Melbourne. By the systematic way in which Vic.
country districts are worked and the big prices paid,
ostensibly reputable dealers must be running the
trade. One method employed to evade the law is
to smuggle the skins across the N.S.W. border and
consign them openly from there, but in some instances
they are forwarded in paper parcels by rail to pri-
vate addresses in the city, and in others conveyed
personally in the bosom of Matilda. Trapping and
snaring are apparently out of date; at any rate,
the last gang that worked this district poisoned the
joeys with flour and strychnine, gathering the car-
cases each morning and disposing of them in hollow
trees.
* * * *
“Jim Carew” : In Central Australia I saw
a tribe of blacks perform a ceremony that I have
never seen mentioned by any Abo. specialist. There
were about 200 natives, and one night they col-
lected their dead children (from about six montlis
to a week old), built a big fire and burnt the bodies.
There were 23 corpses. The parents of a child
squatted on the ground opposite the body’s place
in the fire, yelling and howling. When all were
consumed the ashes, irrespective of whom they be-
longed to, were distributed among the gins. The
scene of the ceremony was over half a mile from
the blacks’ camp, and although I questioned some
of them about it I could get no information as to
its meaning.
“Eddyson”: Beenambie is 36 miles from
the railway town, and Pringle and his party of
three were riding along the red track winding
in the clean, cool morning hours, primeval bush
to right and left, a vista of blue mountain ahead.
The idea was to catch the four mixed to Mel-
bourne, and there was a long, unhurried, delightful
ride ahead provided the wind did not shake up the
intolerable red rust of the unmade way. Suddenly
the party drew rein simultaneously. The men sat
amazed in their saddles, gazing down at a small
object in the red rust. The object was a baby,
possibly 20 months old, a live baby gnawing an
apple, and grinning up at the cavalcade in cordial
good-fellowship. The kiddie was covered with the
track dust, it was hatless and bootless, but per-
fectly happy in its surprising isolation. Nowhere
was there a hint of any man, woman or child who
' might be responsible for the waif, and Pringle
clicked his tongue in eloquent wonderment. “There's
not a house within five miles,” he said. “The
nearest is Twiford’s, and Twiford has no kiddies.”
Pringle stood in his stirrups, and coo-eed into the
bush east and west. Only his own echoes came
back to him. He dismounted to take up the in-
fant and made an illuminating discoverv. “Three
horses have been over the track recently,” he said.
They are ahead. You ride on at a good bat, and
overtake them, Wilson. If there’s no claimant we'll

leave the youngster at Twiford’s, and inform the
police at Pibroch. Wilson put his horse at a gallop
and after a few minutes’ hard riding- sighted a party
ahead. As he drew near he saw that the procession
consisted of a mounted traveller, with two pack-
horses in tow, one of the latter bearing a miscel-
laneous burden, the other, with a tent worked
across his back to form panniers, carrying on one
side a thin, wretched-looking woman sleeping in a
semi-reclining attitude, and on the other a small
boy and a dog, the boy not more than three. “Hello,
hello!” said Wilson, drawing up alongside the
drowsy rider. “Have you people dropped any-
thing ?- ’ The man blinked, thought a moment, and
“No,” said he, “not as I know of. Min!” he
called, “you ain’t dropped nothink, have you ?"
Min sat up abruptly. The question had to be re-
peated. Min uttered a laugh. “Me drop some-
think?” said she in derision. “I ain’t got nothink
to drop.” “No,” said the traveller, “we ain’t
dropped nothink.” He was feeling his pockets, and
recovered his pipe with obvious relief. Here the
woman put up a yell. “It’s Jinnie!” she cried.
Jinnie’s gone!” She fell out of her pannier in
her great concern. “Gorstruth!” gasped the man,
“so she have. S’pose it ain’t a baby you’ve picked
up, mister ?” At this point Pringle came down
the track at a canter, brandishing the baby, and
immediately the grateful parent opened out with
a perfect Niagara of illicit language. He swore
furiously. “Fer two pins I’d cut a club ’n’ belt
yer ribs in,” he said. Pringle had set the
child down. It ran to the panniered horse. The
quaking animal went carefully down, fore-legs first,
like a camel, the kiddy climbed into the pannier
with the boy and the dog, and the docile mare
upreared again. But father’s flow of expletives con-
tinued. Come, come,” said Wilson, “that’s no way
to talk to a lady.” “Lady!” gasped the disgusted
father, “call that a lady, ’n’ ’er drotppin’
things that way, ’n’ not havin’ the sense to stop
and pick ’em up, the .” Then relief came to
the onlookers. It wasn’t his wife he was eloquent
about: it was the horse.

“F.R.” : “Werrimee” (B. 30/10/’l9) not-
withstanding, very little needlewood is used by pipe
manufacturers these days. Although popular in Aus-
tralia years back, more than one doctor declared that
constant smoking of a pipe made from this vege-
table injured the eyesight. After that imagination
did the rest, and there was a hurried rush for briar
or cherrywood.
* * * *
“Te Whare” : Robt. Hall, the veteran bird-
man of Tassy, visited the great delta of the Lena
River (Siberia) in 1903 and saw there many of the
nomadic birds which use Australia as their summer
restaurant. They were then clad in bright wedding-
garments of black and gold and rich browns. About
35 of our waders breed in the Far North, and at
the time of Hall’s visit eggshells lay thick upon
the mosses of the great tundra, while thousands of
young crouched, still as death, in order to escape
discovery. These birds, which include sea-curlews,
sandpipers, whimbrels and (so called) Australian
snipe come to us without a trace of their gay honey-
mooning plumage left. They are dressed in sober
greys and browns. About August the nomads begin
to gather in companies, which gradually increase,
until at length, in widely-extended order, an army
of them start off on their tremendous journey. Hall
saw ruffs leaving for Africa, stints for Australia,
geese for Malaysia, and grey ploveTS “for every-
where.” All must leave the Polar flats and cedar
forests before the bitter cold sets down upon them.
The great trek to Australia is swiftly performed.
Thus the jack, or Australian snipe (Gallinago aus-
tralis), which would leave some time in August,
usually arrives on the far South Coast of N. S.
Wales about the end of September, and I have seen
sandpipers (true sandpipers, not the dottrel fraternity
often miscalled sandpipers) on the coast in that
month, lean and worn after their mighty pilgrimage.
Hall found t'he Australian swift (Cypselus pad ficus )
nesting in the market-place at Yarkutsk, while the
spine-tailed swift (Chactura caudacuta), another of
our visitors, nested on the upper parts of the
Venesei River and the northern parts of the Amoor
basin.

“Lou’ : I think our weightiest rabbit
pelts come from the mountainous country in the
Upper Murray (Vic.), probably the coldest part of
the continent. The best winter bucks go five to the
pound up there. But it’s no picnic trapping them,
there is very little rain, most of the lagoons and
waterways are frozen, and you camp inside a ring
of blazing red-gum logs.
“Dudlyngil”; “Bright” (B. 30/10/’l9) is
obviously wrong when he asserts that the best way
to remove an obstruction from inside a rifle-barrel
is to force it through the muzzle. If he was re-
ferring to a shot-gun his advice would be right
enough, but as all rifle tubes are smaller at the
muzzle then at the breech, his solution isn’t worth
a crow's tooth. When an obstruction occurred in
the barrel of a service rifle (Lee-Enfield) the only
remedy was for the armorer to insert a hook
constructed for the purpose, and angle from the
breech for the cause of the unholy language of the
shooter.
“Kitty Kitty” : Reminiscences of the Man-
ning River (N.S.W.) blacks bring to my mind two
events which tell of harsh treatment of gins by
their bucks. Old Giro Jimmy, a wild abo., camped
at Goneac, was invariably cruel to his wife, until
in desperation she decided to abscond. Knowing
her husband to be an expert tracker, she made her
way chiefly along the rocks of river-beds and where
possible waded through the shallow portions of the
stream. Intent on finding the woman Jimmy very
carefully tracked her, and captured her about 20
miles down the river, at Tigrah. Arrived back at
Goneac he assured himself of keeping his gin at
home by breaking both her legs with his nulla-nulla.
Another buck, Gillarie, was the husband of a gin
who possessed extraordinary beauty. Her charms
drew many blacks to the camp, and Gillarie, incited
by jealousy, disfigured her by making various in-
cisions in her features with a sharp stone.
“M. 8.” : There was fast flying done long
before aeroplanes skimmed in the ether. I did a
bit of it. It was in the good old times when
coaches carried all the passenger traffic of Victoria
except that between Ballarat and Melbourne, and
I was commanding officer of a five-horse team that
ran 10-miles an hour right through from Ballarat
to Skipton. One day, between Iladdon and Smvthe’s
Cieek, the kingpin came out and the fore-carriage
of the vehicle left. I was pulled over and fell
on it, and the team started to send all records
to the mat. They did, too. By dead reckoning
I made it that we covered five miles in four minutes.
I have travelled faster only once—that was when I
fell down a shaft in the dark.
“Bill Bowyang”: “Dohori’s” Papuan
friend (B. 30/10/’l9) who complained that human
flesh is rather salty had uncommon taste. A couple
of allegedly-reformed cannibals told me that in the
good old days when “long pig” was available tney
preferred the Chow to any other brand because of the
salty nature of the flesh. The Papuan looks upon salt as
a luxury. I have heard connoisseurs in N.Q. declare
that the flesh of any human never causes indigestion,
no matter how great the quantity consumed. A
hoary-headed old savage in the Solomons once in-
formed me that if missionaries would only smoke
they would be safe from being eaten, even though
t'hey should be killed, for by the habitual use of
tobacco the body becomes permeated with the taste'
of nicotine, from which all cannibals shrink. Most
cannibals prefer dark flesh, as the black man has
more oil in his system. This makes the steaks and
chops tenderer and better eating. Much, of course,
depended upon the manner in which the tucker was.
cooked. A favorite method if the victim was cap-
tured alive was to wrap him in leaves and bind him
to a tree, which was afterwards fired. One disad-
vantage was that the captive occasionally burst his
half-burnt bonds and escaped, fearfully mutilated.
No one who did that was looked upon as a gentle-
man. He would be cut dead in the best cannibal
society.

DUNLOP TYRES
SCORED AN EQUALLY IMPRESSIVE SUCCESS.
The greatest aggregation of Motor Cars in Australasia is to be seen at Flemington
on Cup Day, and the array of cars affords a unique opportunity of collecting data
as regards the popularity of the various makes of tyres used by the motorists
present. For years past “Dunlops” have always been an easy first—and this year
was no exception. The appended figures settle without doubt which make of tyre
stands right out by itself for popularity and popularity means satisfactory and
economical service. Look at this !
1337 Cars were paddocked and carefully checked as
regards Covers fitted and carried.
2608 Dunlop Tyres (Australian-made) were listed, or
nearly 2 “ Dunlops” for every
car present at Flemington :: ::
The Dunlop total exceeded the aggregate of any
other 4 makes of tyres tabulated.
This dominance is attributable to the fact that Dunlop Quality, Dunlop Workmanship,
and Dunlop Service represents the maximum value and mileage. Many claims are
made in respect to which make of tyre gives the most satisfactory results on our roads.
The census of opinion amongst the users—and they are the only ones that count—places
Dunlop Tyres an easy first. As it pays these motorists to use “ Dunlops,” why
not enjoy the same economical and satisfactory service? Obtainable all Garages

BIO.
A Satchel of Books
Diggerettes, by Cecil L. Hartt (A. C
band-ford, Sydney). A collection of Digger
yarns with suitable illustrations could not
fail to interest. But Cecil Hartt. does more
'nif n ” I * :e F es t' He leaves you chuckling.
±ne drawings .are good and catch the spirit
of the Australian soldier, while many of the
jokes stand among the best. Samples:—
4 Scene: Regimentai Orderly Room. Digger being:
• t 0 , , * or talking too loud in trenches. Digger,
in defence: “Well, sir, I ain’t got a voice like a
silkworm.
General Monash urgently needed a German prisoner
t'> verify his views as to certain country over which
his men were to advance. Orders were given for one
t> be brought before him. Two stalwart Diggers at
length arrived with a weedy Teuton between them.
I e was spectacled, and so diminutive that Monash
could not help observing: “What a small soldier!
Where did you get him ?” The Diggers shuffled un-
easily, and one at length stammered, “Speakin’ gos-
pel, sir, we bought him from the Tommies for a
bob.”
First Digger (laboriously writing a letter home):
‘Hey, Dig! ’Ow do yer spell adder ?” Second
Digger: “A-D-D-E-R.” First Digger: “No, not
adder, the snake. I mean ’adder good time.”
A massive Digger was doing his best to have a
wash out of a two-by-three pannikin. General Bird-
wood happened to pass. “That’s right, inv man,”
su’d the General, “having a good wash?” “Yes,
s : r,” said the Digger, “only I wish I was a blinkin’
canary.”
The appearance of the book is its worst
feature. These yarns and drawings were
worthy of a first-class cover and better
papef.
Likewise , by 11. B. Bignold (Law Book
Co., Sydney). This is a booklet of more or
less smart epigrammatic remarks on all sorts
of subjects. For instance :
Beauty can afford to be silent: ugliness must
talk.
Bores have staying power.
Complete ignorance of this world is no conclusive
proof of inside knowledge of the next.
Those there be who can float a company to exploit
the*silver lining to a cloud.
Society consists of pillars and caterpillars.
There are scores of other remarks no better
and no worse than these.
The Doings of Dave, by Con Drew (N.S.W.
Bookstall Co., Sydney). There is humor in
these yarns of the doings of spielers, though
the note is not always fresh. The tales are
well told, and the author can get his effect
easily and without waste of words. There
are illustrations by Percy Lindsay which
help. A capital book for a short railway
journey.
H inds of the Dawn, by John Oxenham
(Methuen, London). Dull papers on the
general moral aspect of things after the
war. The writer clings too safely to the
commonplace view to make any serious
appeal.
Quoth the Raven, by E.V.L. and G.M.
(Methuen, London). This is a clever-run-
ning satire on the conduct of the war. To
their eternal credit, the people of the Brit-
ish Islands laugh well at themselves. Their
sense of humor may present miculties to
outsiders, but their settled conviction that
their own ways are absurd acts as a national
tonic. This book is a fine example of their
attitude, but, to do the authors justice, both
drawings and letterpress are full of a
humor that is more than British. North-
clifife and Lloyd George are the targets for
most of the quips.
Susan's lAttle Sins, by Mary E. Lloyd
(Judd Publishing Co.. Sydney). Susan is
a dressmaker who finds the joy of life and
relief from her sordid surroundings in her
“little sins,” which are stories that she writes
after her working hours. The book is ex-
cellently done, and holds the attention well.
Susan is a live figure; and her lodgings and
work-room become very real. She burns all
her unpublished manuscript at last, and be-
gins almost at once to write again; and if
Susan to any extent represents the author
that new writing is well worth while. There
are flashes of real inspiration in it.
The Equipment of the Worker (the Eng-
lish worker) is a book by many authors de-
scribed as “an inquiry into the adequacy of
the adult manual workers for the discharge
of their i-esponsibilities as heads of house-
holds, producers and citizens.” The inquiry
is certainly enormous, for 2G7 out of the 334
pages recount how visits were paid to a
vast number of men and women who were
questioned, inspected and classified. Their
homes and habits, including their drinking
habits, are described. They range from the
man who is “highly intelligent and an ideal
husband and father” to the lady wffio is
“domestic servant and prostitute chiefly.”
These scores of humble folk were asked a
multitude of questions by the intruder, in-
cluding their knowledge of Columbus, Magna
Charta, the Reform Act of 1832 and Wolsey,
and their views on Protection and Geo. V.
It is a tribute to the effect of the human eye
on the working classes that not one of them
threw the inquirer down the stair of the tene-
ment house. Sheffield, where the investiga-
tion took place, is possibly an extra-patient
town. The verdict is that the great majority
of the inspectees were not sufficiently
equipped for the battle of life —w r ere born
stupid or diseased or both, or grew up igno-
rant or became wicked or something—and no-
thing definite is said as to what should be
done with them except leave them alone or'
inspect them again. (Geo. Allen and Unwin,
Ltd., London.)
Spiritualism—the Inside Truth, by Stuart
Cumberland (Odhams, London). For many
years Cumberland’s hobby has been the ex-
posure of fraudulent mediums, and his suc-
cesses have seduced him into a preposterous
egotism. His previous book, "That Other
World,” which came out last year, was
merely bluster. The present one is a noisy
echo in a cheap edition.
Kate, Plus Ten, by Edgar Wallace (Ward,
Lock, London). Kate is the managing-
director and chief strategist of a crime
syndicate. The professional attentions of
Inspector Presterton, combined with his
affection for Kate, provide numerous thrills.
Contrary to orthodox sensation, the detective
eventually secures his prey with a wedding-
ring. AVallace has written several better
yarns and many worse. The missing train
incident, by the way, was done by Conan
Doyle in a short story some years ago.
The Mystery of Hartley House, by Clifford
S. Raymond (Doran, New York), opens
well, but the thrill gets bushed. A young
doctor is engaged by a weird old man as
his resident medico. The old man’s beauti-
ful daughter and his temperamental butler
soon furnish the hero with an object in
life. A haunted pool, a penitentiary, a
Spanish pirate with ear-rings and a stolen
diary are flung in as ballast. After the
first hundred pages the action becomes slug-
gish and the dialogue windy. The yarn con-
tains so much butler that he becomes a
nuisance.
Insect Artisans and Their Work, by Edward
Step (Hutchinson, London). Another eom-
mendable insect-book written in popular
style. Ihe author has classified his material
oy industries—miners, weavers, masons
carpenters, upholsterers, tailors, horticul-
turists, sanitary officers, musicians, burglars
etc. Amongst the horticulturists are the
Indian termites who cultivate a special kind
of mushroom for food, and even weed out
undesirable growths. The bee as a wax-
worker was responsible for a correction in
the book of logarithms, and the sexton-beetle
could give points to the most muscular grave-
digger who ever got up a thirst. One of
them in two days buried a mole 40 times the
gravedigger’s weight and bulk.
Wander-Ships, by Wilbur Bassett (Opeu
Court Publ. Co., Chicago), is a, set of folk-
stones of the. sea. These collected legends
of uncanny ships are divided into five classes
—reward ships, punishment ships, phantom
ships, ships of the death voyage, and devil
ships, each class illustrated by an excellent
story. The notes appended to each are in-
teresting

/‘Old Man”: “Copy Boy” 18. 6/11/’l9)
pictures Jack McLaren (“McNorth”) as a
literary hunter romping into camp with a
train of bearers loaded with tropical raw-
material to be knocked into merchantable
goods on a very tired typewriter, while a
T« ied Z 00kh ! g man or two barrow his
stuid off to the publishers. The real Jack
McLaren wouldn’t recognise this portrait of
his modest self. Possessed of an enviable
rund of first-hand experience of life on the
outer rim, and a sympathetic and very keen
sense of values in those things that make
literature possibly, he also must plead guilty
to having industrious habits, and (lately)
a good amount of leisure in which to express
himself, both with regard to those “crowded
hours of glorious life” which perhaps no city-
dweller can quite realise, and also the
peculiar philosophy which his life in wild
places has given him. He is not out to
score as a “seorch-the-wind” producer or a
best seller’’—though because of the live
quality and virile handling of his matter he
may yet become the latter in spite of him-
self.
Silas Snell’ : When I first entered into
journalism I worked for a man named Wat-
son, a great writer—in fact, the most assidu-
ous writer I have ever known. He was
always at it, either in his own home or
in the dingy office of the small, half-thief
weekly he edited, and to which he supplied
all the original matter it contained. For
oOs. he provided his rag with columns
and columns of pars, anecdotes and sketches
and a fresh short-story every week. When
I expostulated with him for making a slave
of himself he replied: “The pay’s nothing,
it is all for the boy. He will appreciate
it when he grows up. Those stories of mine
attract no attention in the Press, but they
will be a gold-mine for him. I am writing
many more. Literature is a wretched game
in Australia to-day, but the time will come
when the people will crave genuine stuff
about themselves and theirs. Then will come
my boy’s opportunity. He will publish the
stones. I shall have posthumous fame, and
he will be rich.” Poor Watson did not live
long, buj: he left a stack of printed and im-
printed stories to make a score of books,
and the MSS. of two long novels, not to men-
tion essays and articles. “William will ap-
preciate them. William will sell them all!”
were the last words of his I heard. I met
William lately. He is now 30. and a most
efficient billiard-marker, I am told. I men-
tioned his father’s literary leavings. “What,”
said William, with an air of surprise, “did
the old pot write stories?”
Business, Robbery, etc.

“0.K.” : Nobody on the look-out for easy
money should take his walks abroad with-
out a dog in attendance —a good sporting
dog. A man arrested for attempted pocket-
picking in the paddock at Flemington on
Derby day was found to have £254 10s. in
notes in a suit-case at his lodgings. And
how did they come into his possession? He
told the ’tecs that when he was walking
in Centennial Park, Sydney, the other week,
his dog scratched them out of a tin which
was buried in the ground. Good dog!
“H.H.” (taking an optimistic view of
it) : The frequent cabled tales of lost
or broken or drowned air-captains on Euro-
pean or American flights are at least a
reminder that Australia, however bad it may
be for railway enterprise, was specially
meant by Providence for air navigators.
Many of the Northern long-flight men were
lost in fogs. Australia couldn’t raise
a decent fog to save its life. The trouble
in connecting Europe with Western Asia or
Northern African is the crossing of the big
stormy inland sea——the Mediterranean.
Australia’s nearest approach to an inland
sea is Lake Eyre. There is, of course, an-
other way out of Europe, via the Caucasus,
but they are 13,000 ft. high in places, and
Noah lost his ark there. Australia isn’t
burdened with a Caucasus. The fact that
Prado, years ago, met his doom among tne
Alps, and that Poulet, the other day, was
in trouble amid the Appenines, the backbone
of Italy, reminds us that Australia is short
of Alps and that its backbone is a hollow.
“Torrential rains” were another grievous
handicap in recent flights, but our strong
point is torrential drought. The shortest
line from America to Europe is long and
cold and stormy and foggy, but between Asia
and Australia there are stepping-stones all
the short distance, and it is a summer
country. Darwin should be a great place
some day. It should be one of the world’s
junctions—the meeting-place and distribut-
ing centre of the foreign trade of a con-
tinent that is better fitted for air traffic
than any other. Webster ought to write a
poem about Darwin if air trade is in Web-
ster’s department.

“H.S.”: The most impudent profiteering
is done, not by the bloated capitalist, but
by smallish men—mostly foreigners. And
in foodstuffs at that. On the same day, in
the same street, in Sydney last week, I
priced the following articles: —
(1) A black bream (pre-war retail price, 1/-;
ditto at the Markets, 4d. to 5d.) : At Mavrogordato’s,
Is. 6(1. ; at the shop of Pericles, half a dozen doors
away, 2s. 3d.
(2) A bottle of claret (sold at the maker’s
offices, about 400 yards distant, for 25.) : At Ryan’s
large and costly pub, 3s. ; at the filthy wine-dive
conducted by Eros Parricide, ss.
(3) A bundle of asparagus: At a Chow vegetable
shop, Is. 6d.; at a Dago establishment over the
way, 2s. (Exactly the same class of asparagus was
being sold in another street, close by, by a white
ex-Digger, for Is. 3d.)
It will be said by theorists that the blessed
doctrine of competition must soon cause the
ruin of the extortionist. It doesn’t. There
is plenty of money—paper money—about
now; and the street-buyer is usually in a
hurry. What does occur eventually is
what happened in Italy the other day. The
mob suddenly turned nasty, and the shops
of the just and the unjust alike were looted
and wrecked. The State Governments have
always had full power to deal with this sort
of profiteering—profiteering, that is, within
their own borders —and the fact that they
have hitherto done nothing is a deadly in-
dictment against them.

“Diaphragm”: While Hughes is consider-
ing the Is. 6d. per day gratuity for the re-
turned soldier, it would be well to send out
a few sparks in favor of the men of the
Australian Naval Wireless Service. Almost
to a man these volunteered for Europe; but
they were debarred by the Naval Board,
which decreed “Mr. Blank is engaged in
wireless work, and as long as he so con-
tinues, he is doing his duty equally with
those who have joined the fighting forces
ashore or afloat. This service does not
carry with it pension rights, other pay-
ments, etc.” Any man who wanted to be
“over there,” and resigned from a wireless
station to go into the training-camp, usually
found himself fired out to do wireless work
in some malaria or other fever-infested area.
With long hours, poor apparatus, fevers and
rotten pay the boys had a dismal time.
Malaria has got almost every man who w'ent
north, and it would be a little recompense
if they had a bond or two.
* * * *
“Marmoset”: I struck the genuine article
in patriotism on the road between Tenter-
field and Casino (N.S.W.). It's a pub
where all soldiers in uniform are given
meals free. As the road is a much-travelled
one, hundreds of lunches are called for, not
to mention breakfasts and teas —an average
of a dozen a day have been provided during
the last 12 months or more. “Got no time
for these patriotic collections,” the old man
explained. “May be all right, but I can’t
tell where the money goes. I know where
the meals go.” “And how about married
chaps—are the wives fed free?” No blanky
fear,” the boss confided. “If they want
luxuries, they got to pay for ’em!”

Owing to its notoriety in the matter of
stray bullets Melbourne refers to Fitzroy
nowadays as No Man’s Land.
“Helersy”: P.M.G. Webster is cleaning
up his department all right. Lately a letter
was received at Hawthorn (Vic.) post
office for delivery to a local resident. It
had been posted in Melbourne in 1874! Tin-
addressee died years ago. A postman wear-
ing mourning is to lay it reverently on the
tomb.
Bertram Mackennal has been asked by
cable to try to deliver the Edward VII.
statue in London by December 31. For five
years the ornate. pedestal and its concomi-
tants have been ready; but war has delayed
the statue. The site is in Alexandra Park,
midway between Prince’s Bridge and Federal
Government House. It is proposed, if pos-
sible, to have Edward nicely bedded by
March, 1920.
“Zantlius” ; The longest way round was the
shortest way home with the barque Inver-
nell. She sailed from Melbourne on July 6
for Bunbury (W.A.), but westerly gales
drove her far to the eastward. Captain Ship-
pen decided to run with the wind and go
by way of the Horn and the Cape of Good
Hope, thus almost circumnavigating the
globe. The distance covered was about 14,500
miles, and it took 76 days, an average of 292
miles a day, one of the best runs on record.
“Wai-Hoi”: Near Perth (W.A.) I recently
saw a collie dog give a remarkable perform-
ance. The daughter of the household is a
fine musician, and has a most varied reper-
toire. Now, the tyke will take no notice
of Mendelssohn, Bach, Chopin, rag, hymn or
jazz; but immediately anything of Grieg’s
is struck up he goes dotty, rushing at the
player and howling like the Devil’s newest
boarder. This, I am assured, has been going
on ever since the dog was six months old,
and he’s now rising four.
According to Inspector-General Freeman,
Vic.’s daily average prison population for
1918 was 641 (566 males and 75
females). Some people feared to de-
molish a number of useless gaol build-
ings because of the possible “backwash
of the war period’’; but the 1918
figures were 111 (105 males and six females)
less than the numbers for 1917. Freeman
attributes the diminution partly to the en-
listment of actual and potential offenders,
but more to the prosperity of the State,
good wages, education, technical training,
children’s courts and Kathleen Mavourneen
sentences.
“Naming” : I’ll be more careful next time.
Coming to town from Marrickville a few
days ago I found I had nothing to finance
the trip but a £l-note and a penny. I asked
the gaurd what he knew about that. He
scowled horribly and said he’d fix it later.
I hid my blushes behind a paper. An oblig-
ing lady passenger offered to cash the note,
and juggled out some silver into her own
hand, aiid passed it to me in a neat heap.
The business training of many years urged
me to count, but I was scared off it by a
smile that threatened my very existence if
I dared to be so rude, and I risked no
further trouble. When I got home I was
a bob short, and a second was represented
by a German mark, dated 1915.
The news of the divorce boom in London
reminds one of the chronicles of the fashion-
able divorce colony at Reno, which is more
exclusive than the Travellers’ Club, and
your name has to be on the board there for
at least 150 years before you are admitted
to membership. Recent cases involve Milli-
cent Duchess of Sutherland’s parting from
her Australian husband, a son of the late
Hon. Nicholas Fitz Gerald, of Melbourne;
the sundering of the Marchioness Conyngham
{nee Tobin, of Victoria) from Lord Conyng-
ham, nephew of Lady Linlithgow] of Lady
Clifton from the son of Florence Morphy,
who married Ivo Bligh. now Lord Darnley;
and of the Hon. Mrs. Michael Scott, a Syd-
ney girl who took Lord Eldon’s son for better
or worse.
“Macquarie-street” on medical manners:
The Bulletin (23/10/’l9) comments on the want
of esprit de corps in the medical profession, and
instances the case of a medical member of the A.I.F.
being cold-shouldered by seven out of eight suburban
practitioners when he called to inform them that he
had commenced practice in their midst.
The Medical- Journal has cited instances of
medical men worming themselves into the con-
fidence of patients, ostensibly on behalf of the other
fellow who was engaged in doing his bit at the
war, but in reality for the advancement of then-
own ends, having never from the first intended to
hand over intact the practices so innocently and
trustfully committed to their care. It is impossible
to fathom the psychology of such a monstrous con-
dition of affairs, but it may be assumed that the
public’s short-lived memory for medical services re-
ceived is largely to blame. It does not require
ability in a practitioner to do this kind of thing,
but merely cunning and a good address. The main
thing is never to answer the patient back, but to
make him believe that he is running the show.
Such doctors will listen to abuse quite unmoved
just as my butcher tells me he has to do. This
subject wants a thorough ventilation, and it is to
be hoped that a list of the culprits has been pre-
pared, and that proper steps will be taken by the
newly-formed Medical Society, whose members are
all oversea men, to remedy a disgraceful state of
affairs. Underlying it all is that too many students
enter the medical schools, which are simply pouring
out doctors by dozens. With the growth of com-
mercialism, and the entrance of Tom, Dick and
Harry into what was former,ly a rather exclusive
profession, it was inevitable that there would be a
great deterioration of the ethical standard, and this
has become more marked with the war, until at last
the profession has become a business.
How can the well-educated, well-bred and deli-
cately nurtured youth who decides to become a
doctor from a love of science hope to hold his own
against rivals who have inhaled an atmosphere of
sordid commercialism with their earliest breath, and
who, when they become medical graduates, occupy
themselves with the first dubious scheme for pro-
fessional advancement that will successfully evade the
rules laid down by the B.M.A. concerning self-
advertisement ?
The commercially-minded doctor can buy and sell
his rival who battles along on a scientific basis; and,
unfortunately, such a man, though he will descend
to tactics that are usually associated with the turf
and the stadium, is petted by a very large pro-
portion of the profession, instead of being consigned
to Coventry.

'"THE STUDEBAKER “LIGHT SIX” possesses
ample power and fine roominess, which make for
comfort, and convenience. This car, although called
“Light,” has, nevertheless, a remarkable strength and
sturdiness of construction. It is, like the other members
of the Studebaker group, a beautifully-balanced car.
The long wheelbase, the perfect distribu-
tion of weight over the whole chassis, the
resilient underslung springs, represent the
ideal combination of comfort and great
tyre-mileage. The famous L-Head
Engine, fitted with the remarkable “two
stage Ball and Ball Carburetter, is dis-
tinguished by the utmost petrol economy
and a responsiveness that is incomparable.
The long, low, sweeping lines of the body,
and the elegance of the fittings are as
characteristic as the qualities of dash and
endurance for which this popular model
is famous. The beautiful new “Light
Six’’ Studebaker excels in every detail,
and is offered at a price that is not
equalled in other cars which approach
it in quality and appearance.

“Loyal Aussie”: I went through Cool-
gardie and saw my mates win glory in
France. But the thing that made me feel
proudest was unexpectedly meeting in the
streets of Dunedin a steam-roller labelled
“Made in Australia.”
Hugh Pearce, dead at Glenelg (S.A.) at
65, shod more S. Australians than any
other man. Coming to Australia as a boy
he started a small boot-making business,
which he built up and up until he found
it necessary to have a hand in several tan-
neries.
“Arthur R.”: Re the Wheatstone test pre-
scribed by the Telegraph Department, the
wisdom of having a staff of fairly expert
hand-punchers has been proved again and
again when the "juice” has failed; if the
Department had not insisted on this quali-
fication, inter-State business would many a
time have been hung up until the current
was restored. The test imposed is very
easy, too, only 20 words per minute being
required from operators under 30 years, and
50 from those over that age.
Calliope has been calling again to the Navy.
Early this month, off the Lizard (Eng.), a
cruiser bearing her name caugat fire. As
she steamed the feed-pipe burst and her oil
fuel blazed. The boilers were only pre-
vented from exploding by the grit of a petty
officer (name not given, but he has been on
the job since there was a Navy and pro-
bably before that). He raced through the
Itam-es. turned on the steam pipes, and that
turned down the ace of death. It recalls, the
adventure of another Calliope—that British
warship which flogged out of Apia harbor in
the mouth of a cyclone in 1889. Death that
day stood on the bridge and challenged the
hard-doers there to “make it a go.” Death
lost. And there was another Calliope in
Nelson’s fleet. 87; e made some of our pre-
sent friends very unhappy.
“F.N.T.”; Hitherto the only use made of
the tea-plant in Victoria has been as an
ornamental shrub. Lately, however, James
Griffiths, one of Melbourne’s best-known tea-
men, decided to test the possibilities of grow-
ing the plant for tea-production. He did it
at his naturally-favored country property at
Bayswater, in the Mount Dandenong foot-
hills ; and a quantity of the prepared leaf
has been tested and found of unexcelled
flavor and aroma. Griffiths reckons he could
produce a commercially valuable article but
for the cost of picking, and for the further
fact that the leaves are not available for
plucking all the year round, as they are in
tea-exporting countries. Still, something
may yet be done in the matter, there being
people in Australia quite agreeable to put
quality before price; wherefore Griffiths’s
test is interesting and may be valuable.
“Bill Bowyang”: I’ve been trying to. place
him ever since. He arrived at Bowen
(N.Q.) per coastal steamer Barcoo one
morning, accompanied by several large
wooden boxes. Later in the day he hired
a schooner, loaded it with his cases and six
months’ provisions. When the skipper was
off the coast somewhere near the Burdekin
he asked to be landed. As soon as the cargo
had been put ashore he p.aid the skipper
and arranged for him to return in six
months’ time. A month later a telegraph-
line repairer came across a large tent close
to the beach; but all he gathered about the
new beachcomber was that he was a Yank
and that he had a well-stocked library and
a new typewriter. Six months later the
seho.oner called and took him back to
Bowen, where he caught a steamer going
south. The skipper told me the Yank was
the most silent passenger he had ever ship-
ped, and we agreed tha*t he was an American
author who had gone to this outrof-the-way
spot for “atmosphere” for a couple of pot-
boilers.
“Le Australien’s” experiences of malaria:
Talking about liquor as being the ally of malaria,
I« was for over threg years in the Taurus
Mountains (Anatolia), about 3000 ft. above sea-
level. I did not pick on this spot as a suitable
residence. Jacko did that for me when he sent
a mixed lot of British, Russian, French and Aussie
prisoners to work on the Bagdad railway line. The
first summer saw more than half the camp ill with
malaria, and our experience and observation showed
that the liquor theory was not tenable. The camp’s
most notorious teetotallers . went down first, while
its three pet “drunks” suffered from nothing more
serious than the things drunkards usually suffer from.
We began to think that drink was a defence against
an attack, but this theory, too, was in its turn
abandoned, for two out of the three hard drinkers
were taken in a highly delirious state to the hospital.
The last of the trio became alarmed at this and
swore off, but it was not long befo»e he followed
the others. Practically everyone in camp had had
the ailment by then. I might mention the three
hard drinkers recovered as fast as anyone ever does
recover from malaria, while the teetotallers, for the
most part, did not.
“Clifford Street”: A Buu / ETi*r writer
9/KI/M9) remarked of Willie Kelly:—
Commonly regarded as a top-liner of fashion, he is
really conspicuous for the inconspicuousness of his
clothes.
A notion still lingers that the man of fashion
is he who wears a coat with numerous but-
tons arranged in groups of fours, brown
boots with suede tops, a tie with the Union
Jack on it, and a white velour hat. Others
look on the over-dressed stage type, of which
M. B. Fig try m provides a horrible example,
as the mo.uld of form. “Him a gentleman
I once heard a dress-critic cry scornfully
in reference to Du Maimer (one of the
best and most quietly-attired men on the
London stage). “ Where's ’is jooler.y ?” The
fact is inconspicuousness has been the key-
note of the exquisite ever since Brummel’s
day. Brummel wore no colors, plain
socks, a.nd the simplest boots. His suc-
cessors all over the world depend for their
effects on the cut of their clothes and boots,
and on the perfected detail of their shirts,
collars, and so forth. Buc(i a one said dis-
gustedly of Disraeli, who, like many .Tews,
over-dressed to his dying day. and had a
particular partiality for ornaments: “Dizzy
was there —Fung in chains like a convict.”
Youthful Australian males get their present
tendency towards flash dressing from its
admitted home—America.

Wouldn’t it be great to have electric light all over the farm just
at the snap of a switch—cheaper, better, safer than kerosene
lamps, air gas, and other old-fashioned forms of lighting. And
power, as well as light, flows from the Western Electric Out-
fit. Mother can use an electric fan in hot weather, an electric
washing machine, electric iron, sewing machine, and vacuum
cleaner. Father can have a portable handy motor for driving
the separator, churn, grindstone, and other light machines.
The Generator has a capacity of 1500 Watts and the
Battery 180 Ampere Hours, more than twice the capacity
of any other Outfit. A few extra lights or a sewing
machine going won’t trouble you.
Heavier machines such as a sawbench, chaffcutter, pump
etc., are driven off the pulley of the big 31/4 h.p. Engine.
It burns kerosene—feeds itself with fuel and oil, is air
cooled, throttle governed, starts by pressing a lever and
automatically stops when the battery is fully charged.
No outfit ever offered to farmers, squatters, storekeepers,
institutes, halls and island plantations can compare with
WESTERN ELECTRIC POWER and LIGHT.
It’s a fool-proof outfit with 40 years of electrical experience behind it.
Don’t buy an outfit that’s too small—that only gives light. Get Western
Electric which has a big powerful battery, and is a real power outfit
which soon earns its cost. It’s easy for any farmer to buy too !

Head and Face Worst.
Was Terribly Itchy.
“Baby got a rash nearly all over.
Her head and face were the worst and
the rash appeared in
blotches. The skin was
both red and inflamed and
the irritation often pre-
vented her from sleeping.
It was terribly itchy and
she used to rub it.
“She suffered at least
two months before I used Cuticura Soap
and Ointment when 1 sent for a sample.
I then bought some more Cuticura
which healed her.” (Signed) Mrs. Alb.
Pfeiffer,Bland P.O.,Via Bimbi,N.S.W.
For every purpose of the toilet Cuti-
cura Soap and Ointment are supreme.

“G.H.” ; “0.K.” has my sympathy in his
search for Australian-made matches (B.
30/10/’l9). I, too, have worn out much
boot leather this week in a search for Bryant
and May’s matches, but have failed to locate
even a dozen. As I can’t light my pipe with
one of Hughes’s fiery speeches, I must use
imported rubbish. Wherever I go I see
“good Australian unionists” using Jap stuff,
whilst Bryant and May had to close down
and throw out of employment a large num-
ber of their fellow’-unionists because the fac-
tory could not pay Australian wages and
compete with the cheap Asiatic.
“Fleurs”: It is stated that the woolbuyers
of Sydney “view with disgust” the intention
of Germans to begin business again. For my
part I would as soon associate with a Ger-
man who would but couldn’t fight for his
country as I would with an Englishman who
could and didn’t. Many English woolbuyers
in Australia hung on here, on one pretence
or another, while there was conscription in
the U.K.; and now they ask that a number
of competitors should be removed from their
path on patriotic grounds ! If they clamored
for an effective tariff against the importation
to Australia of cheap Hun goods one might
listen to them. But that we should refuse
to let Germans pay our prices for our wool
is too much altogether!
“ J. 8.”: The swooning-eyed flappers who
decorate the smoking-cars on Australian rail-
ways are hereby invited to draw around.
On a Sydney suburban line the other day
the tobacco reserve was half-full of young
ducks. Four of them cluttered in two seats
fore-and-aft. In bustled a man with a piece
of paper and a pencil in his hand: “Ladies.”
he said, “I must ask you to leave the smok-
ing car. You know the regulation” (here
he made busy with his stationery). “There
is plenty room in the ladies’ car —one batk.”
The abashed females arose and swinging in-
dignation from their hips (equivalent to
man’s and ——• you) got out. Then the
other fraud sat down and the remaining
three seats were rushed. I was part of the
rush.
“Kaylee”: The home-bound Diggers on
the Baramba put up a newspaper record
at Capetown. They wirelessed the Cape
Times that they would arrive on a Satur-
day and leave Sunday and during their
stay would require a paper issued. The
Times, on account of the Saturday and
Sunday work, declined the job. Emerging
from the office the disappointed D.ggers ran
into a small boy with a printer’s push-cart.
He steered them to his boss, who took over
the copy at 2 p.m. Saturday, and, with
Digger comps, and proof-readers giving a
hand, turned over 1500 24-page heavily-
illustrated copies of the Barama Souvenir
at 3 p.m. Sunday.
“Anglicus” : “Ex-O.C. Troops” writes (B.
30/10/’l9) of the turbulent Bahia Castillo
crowd being “nearly all of them Pommies,”
and of course everybody says, “Now, if they
had only been Diggers!” Can anyone say
when a man is a Pommy and when he isn’t?
A posthumous V.C. was awarded the other
day to an Englishman who had served in the
A.I.F. He was written up as an Australian
hero. Ten per cent, of the casualties in
the A.I.F. during the war showed British
addresses, and plenty more who gave Aus-
tralian addresses were of British birth. Were
they Pommies, or Australian heroes? The
Bulletin stated some time ago that eight of
the first 26 Australian V.C.’s were born in
Britain. Were they Pommies?
“Quirk” on a flying stunt: —
Re the “tail slide,” mentioned by “Jake” (B.
30/10/’l9). During nearly three years’ experience
as a pilot in the R.A.F., I saw that trick done only
once, and it was due to the presence of mind and
ability of the pilot that the experiment did not
end in the nearest cemetery. The pilot instructor
was teaching a pupil how to “spin” a machine, and
after several demonstrations he told the novice to
have a try. The pupil pulled the machine into a
stall and, instead of setting elevators and rudder hand
over, he left them near central. The machine stalled
tail first (“tail slide”) and broke the ailerons off
their hinges. How it is that rudder and elevators
did not suffer the same fate is a mystery. The pilot
managed to get the machine down safely, but was
not keen to try again, and no others would attempt
it. An aeroplane would stall tail-first for a short
distance if it were possible for the pilot at the
moment of stalling to put all controls at dea 1
central. That would have the effect of placing the
ailerons, elevators and rudder in streamline with
the main ’planes, tail ’plane and fin respectively. As
it is almost impossible to do this, I would advise
all pilots who have not done a tail slide to let
some other chap have a go first. As the greatest
weight in a machine is forward it must make
a machine nose-dive eventually, consequently a tail
slide could not last long enough to put out a fire
and would not be of much use in that event. But
I have seen a couple of fires put out by a steep
side-slip, with the nose of the machine as far up
as possible without stalling.
“Dido”: The fashionable dressmaker
knows almost as many secrets as a confi-
dential family solicitor, and, as a rule, is
just as “oyster.” One, however, lets out,
largely in self-defence. She was commis-
sioned by a well-to-do dame to make a Cup
dress of very costly material. The dress
was within an ace of completion when it
suddenly and mysteriously disappeared. The
customer was furious. She demanded the
full value of her gorgeous garment, with a
little over for hurt sensibilities; she talked
of the carelessness of people who employ
thieves, and asked if Madame was in the
habit of losing one-hundred-guinea frocks as
if they were dish-wipes. Madame was ter-
ribly distressed. She called in the police,
and promised that everything possible would
be done to recover the missing garment. Two
days later the customer reappeared, tear-
stained and full of contrition, apologising
profusely, and pleading with Madame to call
the police off at once. Her own mother,
who was having a dress made at the same
establishment, had “pinched” the apparel, and
had turned up at a dinner at the daughter’s
own house, wearing the daughter’s own
plumage! It was the first hint the family
had of kleptomaniaeal symptoms in mamma':
but a search revealed that within the last
few months she had misappropriated a tre-
mendous amount of stuff.

Get the booklets “The Wick of the
Willard” and “A Mark with a Meaning
for You” from the nearest Willard
Service Station.
The story of a remarkable storage battery
invention and what it is doing for Motorists.
In the fall of 1917 readers of national magazines read
about a new Willard, a Still Better Willard, a Willard with
an entirely new idea in battery construction—Threaded
Rubber Insulation.
The Still Better Willard was not an experiment—for
two years before the announcement a car builder put it on
35,000 cars. Many of those first Willard Batteries with
Threaded Rubber Insulation are still in use after four years.
What is the Secret of Threaded Rubber Success ?
Insulation had always been the big problem with any
storage battery. Ordinary materials wore out before the
battery plates did. Re-insulation was bound to come sooner
or later, and when insulation began to break down the plates
were injured.
But Willard, for the first time found a practical way to
use rubber, the one ideal insulating material, by piercing
each rubber insulator with 196,000 tiny threads to permit
passage of the electrolyte.
You ought to be posted on batteries and battery
insulation, so that when you need a new battery you’ll be
sure of the best your money can buy.

BUSHMEN “THE WATCH”
The “Super Fx and R” Watch has no equal for hard bush wear.
With 80 years of experience we KNOW this. What a Watch it is!
Every improvement known to horological science is in it. It is
especially made for us for Australian hard-wear conditions.
Knowledge, effort, money unstinted, have been used to produce a
watch that a man can set at standard time, go with it into the

All needed is that it be wound. Jewelled where the wear occurs.
We guarantee it for 15 years, and keep it in order free for 12
months, breakages excepted.
The price is not low, 63/-, in a steel case, but what really

The soothing of Melbourne’s savage breast
by grand opera at Her Majesty’s is
a prosperous enterprise thus far; in
fact, reinforced by “Bolifeme,” the first
week’s repertoire kept business boom-
ing for a second w T eek. “Bohbme,”
sung by Amy Castles, sister Eileen, Wheat-
ley, Loder, Valenti, Collier and Minogue, is
more efficiently put through than in days
when the same Mimi was less plump and her
decease from consumption distressed a dif-
ferent crowd of stony-broke bohemians.
Eileen Castles is not an ideal Musetta as re-
gards vocal requirements, but she has the
necessary gaiety and pertness for the part of
the giddy girl, and the male character parts
are played almost up to the artistic level of
the Slapoffskian orchestra. Of Amy’s sub-
stantial Mimi it may be said that she never
opens her mouth without recommending her-
self for the position, and her smile often
amounts to an apology for her unemotional
style. “Tales of Hoffmann” is popular, it
seems, on account of its being constructed on
revue lines, and the doll scene, with its broad
comedy and showy chorus effects, is voted an
adorable item. In point of fact, it is undis-
guised comic opera.
Nothing in good old »“Trovatore” is quite
so ridiculous as the moral lessons in “Hoff-
mann,” though Verdi’s opera rashly exposes
itself to ridicule when it is mostly sung in
English. The men warble the language of
the composer, while Strella Wilson, Vera
Bedford and Isla Gamble express their senti-
ments in discreet Australian. The mixed
party, encouraged by chorus and orchestra,
make a very good job of “Trovatore.” Strella
Wilson looks well, lets herself go dramati-
cally without going too far, and uses her
strong sopran® with confidence and true in-
tonation. Vera Bedford, too, makes the
most of her strong, clear, nondescript vocal
equipment in the character of the aged gipsy.
Also her make-up means well, but she seems
a bit young and jaunty apart from her
camouflaged countenance.
* * * *
Last Saturday the bill was “Faust” again,
Amy Castles, as the susceptible, easy-going
Gretchen, being associated with the artists
who appeared with Patti Russell the pre-
vious week. And the same people put a
little more vim into their work, even the
unsardonic Satan jndulging in an extra
snigger when the curtain was falling on the
garden scene. On Wednesday of this week
Gertrude Johnson was to get her show in
“Lucia.”

dazeling history of
Lindsay’s achievement
since he took to the
needle in 1918. The
show ranges from his
first attempt to his
latest, and it is pos-
sible to watch him
emerging from his
early restraint to a
confidence and mastery
that have enabled him
to stamp the medium
with his personality.
Every print in the col-
lection is a success,
but there are some like
“The Death of Pierrot”
and “Ballet Entrance”
wherein the line is so
delicate that the rush-
ing sensitiveness of the
beauty attained is
almost swept away by
the wonder of the per-
formance. Necessarily
such an artistic gal-
lant as Norman has
filled his etchings
with females and made
every touch an endear-
ment ; but, though he
looks at thebeloved form
with the old exuberant
vision, the imagination
is too conscious of the job in hand to permit a purely
pictorial absorption in its curves. To the present
writer Norman Lindsay’s fascination is not so much
the fertility of his fancy, or his genius in realising
the expectant hush before a thundering climax, but
rather that astonishing loveliness of technique which
allows him to put his dreams before you. In the
present exhibition one has seen the exquisite tracery
of lace on flesh presented with a conception of the
frailty of the fabric that is only comparable in
quality to the finest pianissimo of music.
“Lightuin’ ” is at last on its last legs at
Melbourne Royal, but there are ceremonies
to come ere the American play is off the
premises. John O’Hara is announced to
conduct a celebration in town on Saturday
morning, and on Monday the 100th perform-
ance will be marked by souvenirs. On tile
29th comes the long delayed “Theodore and
Co.”
Concerning “Tails Up,” at Melbourne
Tivoli, all that this journal said last week
can be taken as repeated. In a revue which
is fairly strong in pardonable plagiarism
one of the neatest skits deals with “Eyes of
Youth” and the magic crystal.
Wirths’ Circus is vaguely understood to be
nearly through with its season at Melbourne
Olympia, but the geese and other wild ani-
mals continue to be received with numerous
roars of astonishment. If the Circus can
be conveniently delayed, the elephants will
stay where they are for another week or
two. Then, for the first time for five years,
it will put to sea and give Mqoriland a thrill.
The “Everyman” performance, lately men-
tioned as a suburban production of Mel-
bourne’s Mermaid Play Society, is to get a
chance of wider patronage at the Playhouse,
off Prince’s Bridge. Seven nights of the old
morality drama will date from Saturday this
week, when the curtain will rise at 8.15, and
any fools who come to scoff will remain to
pray. In these artistic ventures the trouble

be that interest in
"Everyman” will be
tickled by public re-

William S. Hart

signed his buckskins

named Shark Monroe.

usual savageries in the

but by-and-bye a vision

This pathetic reduc-
tion of a human being
to a jumbuck is
brought about in a
couple of hours of
thrill at Hoyt’s Mel-

also Dorothy Gish in
“Boots” has changed
her name to Gush,
and Gladys Brockwell
has opened her shaky
orbs to the perilous
“Pitfalls of a Great
City.” At the Melba
Clara Kimball Young
is living in “The
House of Glass” and suggesting that she
ought to have the edifice whitewashed.
Next door, at the Britannia, Dorothy
Phillips is pursuing “Destiny” without
making sensational progress in the chase.
Melbourne has taken kindly to “ ’Possum
Paddock” at the King’s, and Kate Howarde
has been compelled to engage a weighbridge
to estimate the takings.
At Sydney Criterion the profitable “Tailor-
made Man” will get away with the takings
for the last time to-morrow night. On
Saturday M. B. Figman will commence a
farewell run in “Nothing but the Truth.”
“Old Lady 31” is feeling rather sleepy at
Sydney Palace. A trembling hand has put
a card inscribed “Last Nights” in the win-
dow, and the cat will be ejected on Satur-
day, November 29.
“Going Up” has now been in the air over
Sydney for 13 weeks, and Her Majesty’s re-
mains cheerful in spite of the threatened
stoppage of fiddling over a question of pay.
“My Lady Frayle” continues to deal with

invents the Eleventh Commandment for
breakage purposes, but emerges unblemished
from the wreckage. The same theatre
shelters the delightful Mary Miles Minter
as Mary O’Rourke in “A Bachelor’s Wife.”
Mary sets out to right the wrong, but wrongs
the right by fathering a baby on the cousin
of the Man Who Did. Elsie Ferguson dresses
“His Parisian Wife” in the most wonderful
manner, and finds her efforts looked upon
as snares of Satan by her husband’s Ameri-
can parents. The picture would make a
great theme for the National Council of
Women, who can view it at Hoyt’s and the
Haymarket.
From an Adelaide critic
Adelaide has for over 20 years been battling along
with an annual Federal Art show, and thinks it
quite time that Sydney and Melbourne joined in to
make it a once-in-three-years affair for each eitv.
Meanwhile the 22 nd Adelaide collection is the best
for 6ome years past. J. R. Jackson (N.S.W.) is
versatile. His Middle Harborscape has been bought
for S. A. Gallery. He also has a large—too large—
picture of a girl receiving bad news, half of the
canvas being waste space of a studio interior. Prices
all round are moderate, and thus the Gallery has
been able to buy four others—Lionel Lindsay’s pea-
cock, by a curiously-blue fountain; Lawson Balfour’s
bathing-beach on a “Midsummer Day,’’ Miss Cum-
brae Stewart's beautifully-done bare back in
“Chinese Coat,” and Dora Wilson’s pierrette, “Car-
nival.” Other visitors are Lister Lister with a
harbor bit, and Wolinski with another (from New
Rochelle) ; Muir Auld with figures full of charm,
and Bombardier Waller with others full of strength.
From Westralia come strong etchings by Van Raalte
Of the local people Will Ashton is missing for once,
and Heysen as usual, but Giles shows much of the
Ashton influence. Old James Ashton has his usual
sound seascapes, locally inspired, Barnes his charac-
teristic local scenery, Archibald Collins some good
heads, and Gladys Reynell strong but unattractive
studies of Kuropean peasantry. Several of Norman
Lindsay’s nudes in black and white help to brighten
a show which is unusually strong in figure-work.
Adelaide is going to have a bigger share of
the shows that are going, now that its
increasing population and carelessness about
money make a second week a necessity for
anything attractive. “Ivatinka” simply has
to extend its stay at the Royal. It goes
with the old rollick, and practically with
the old co.. except that George Welch now
has Phil Smith’s part and rises to his
chance. In other houses the prevailing color
is green. At the Tivoli Dellcourt scores as
Con the Shaughraun, and has other similar
dramas j.n prospect; Linda Travers and
Agnes Iveogh are attractive heroines. At
the Majestic Tom Haveriey and J. P. O’Neill
are a pair of sportive Irishmen, ranging
through various song-and-dance productions
of American origin. In the other part of
the programme DeCar falls about, and
Eurasian has a well-set turn with some
fairly new illusions. Mary Pickford, like
Marie Tempest and “Lady Iluntworth,”
takes a domestic situation for pay in “How
Could You, Jean?” That is at Wonder-
graph. At the Pav., Hale Hamilton is hero
of one of those always-popular stories show-
ing an apparent thickhead who wakes up
and takes down all the clever division. In
this welter of imports there is something
Australian at West’s —Beaumont Smith’s
“Desert Gold,” the mare herself, with
McLachlan (and others) up, the finding of
real gold in the desert, Katoomba scenery, a
motor-car fight, and a dash to the- racecourse
in an aeroplane. Melodrama, of course,
but a well-acted Australian show.
“The Camello”: It happened at a service
for soldiers and civilians in Jerusalem. The
padre had just given out the hymn, “Art ?
thou weary, art thou languid?” when a tired
Australian voice spoke up from behind. "Yes,
and blanky-well fed up, too.”
“Ta rwin” : It’s an ex-sergeant in the 2nd
Field Engineers who kisses the book and
tells this yarn. In September, 1917, he
helped to bury his cobber at Passchendaele.
A wallet and other effects were buried with
him. Twelve months later, at Harbonnitre,
100 miles from Passchendaele, the sergeant
was inspecting a dead Hun, and in his pocket
found the wallet that he had buried with
his cobber at Passchendaele.
“The Camello” : Part of my job was to deal
with applications from the local residents for
civilian jobs in the O.E.T.A. (Occupied
Enemy Territory Administration). Most of
them were easy, but I didn’t know what to
do with this one from a Syrian:—-“I wish
employment. I have a large family to sup-
port, several brothers and sisters in our
family, three adults and adultresses.”
Gordon Public School and Sydney High
School have scored a rare double in N. S.
Wales Rhodes scholars. F. N. Kershaw
(a lieut. with a Military Cross) and Arthur
Wesley AVheen (also a lieut. with two bars
to his Military Medal), who were the 1918
and 1919 selections, started off at Gordon
and finished up at the High. That makes
three Rhodes men from the High School in
the past six years. And still they leave it
wedged in between an iron foundry and a
bedstead factory !
The plays that alternate affairs of to-day
with happenings of the hero’s or the heroine’s
past have been aptly described as “hnek-
pedal dream-plays on the American plan.”
They seem to have done their dash for the
present, but, like the earlier vision-plays,
which draw a moral from a dream of a
hypothetical future, they will have a revival
by-and-bye. Or, perhaps, an ingenious
Yankee dramatist will combine the two ideas
in a tri-part play wherein the thin story of
the present is sandwiched between pictures
of the past and imaginings of what might
come about in the future if the hero or
heroine made it possible. A puzzle play,
perhaps, combining the methods of “Eyes of
Youth” and “On Trial”?
“Dido”: It was at $ big Melbourne
drapery. The lift was crowded with a Cup-
time mob, and was half-way between floors
when the tubby female woke out of her
trance and put up a poignant cry—“Me
money! Me money! Somebody has taken
my purse!” She was chasing all over her-
self in quest of the missing notes. She
tumbled out the contents of her handbag. “I
had it when I came into this lift,” she said
determinedly. “So somebody here has stolen
it. Nine pounds!” She looked with sus-
picion on the pale little woman nearest her.
and the pale little woman backed off. Then,
weeping aloud, she established herself in the
doorway of the lift. “Nobody leaves,” she
said, “till the manager comes.” One in
authority was summoned, and passengers
were protesting against the indignity of
being mauled, when a sudden transformation
arrived. Smiles wreathed her countenance.
“Oh,” she cried, “I just remembered. It’s
all right. I pinned it in Winnie’s hat.”
Winnie was a small child, and now it ap-
peared she was lost. She had been left
wandering at large on the first floor, with
the family treasury hidden in her roof.
“Vaudeville Vet” : One way of abolishing
theatre queues, which are causing Sydney
city council perturbation, is to make an
earlier start than 8 p.m. Vaudeville at
least might adopt the 7.30 or 7 p.m. start
with advantage. In London the first house
is 6.30, and at the Middlesex, Drury-lane,
under just-dead .T. L. Graydon, it used to be
6 o’clock. Graydon put on a number of un-
advertised turns till the regular hour of
starting, and some of them caused him the
Devil’s own trouble. A bunch of angry pros,
due at other halls were held up one night
by an amateur ventriloquist who had his
dolls so arranged that it was impossible to
ring down on him. Graydon did everything
short of creating a scandal by pulling him
off by force, but the vent, defeated the boss's
strategy and went blithely on his way, and
for 20 minutes, during which Graydon aged
five years, held the stage against all comers.
At length the vent., in changing his dummies
for a fresh onslaught, made a false move,
and the curtain cut his act in sections. Gray-
don grabbed one of the dolls by the trouser-
legs, and, swinging it in the air, lobbed the
wooden head on that of the performer. Then
a stage-hand dragged the body info Drury-
lane and set it down with one night’s salary
beside it.

CAN’T BEAT COCOANDT
OIL FOR HAIR WASH.
Girls and women who wish to keep their
hair in nice condition should be most cautious
in the soap they wash it with. Most
soaps and ready-mixed shampoos contain
excessive quantities of alkali. This dries
the scalp, makes the hair brittle and is very
injurious. Just ordinary colinated cocoanut
oil (a pure, saponified but quite greaseless
liquid) is far better than the most costly
soap you could possibly use for a shampoo,
for this cannot possibly hurt your hair.
Merely wet your hair with water and rub it
on. A couple of teaspoonsful make a perfect
flood of rich, thick, creamy lather, and
cleanses both hair and scalp thoroughly. The
lather rinses out easily, and takes with it
every trace of dust, dirt, dandruff or excessive
oiliness. The hair dries quickly and evenly,
and comes out fine and silky, bright, glossy
and fluffy, appearing to be heavier than it is.
And best of all this colinated cocoanut oil
leaves the hair as easy to dress again as
though you hadn’t washed it at all. You can
get colinated cocoanut oil at most any chemist,
but be sure it’s “colinated,” which is not
expensive—a few ounces lasting a long, long
time.
Girls! Women! Give this a Corner on your Dressing-
table. Never Let a Corn Ache Again!
Like a Flash! Few Drops Stop Corns Throbbing,
Then Corns and Callouses Wither Up, Loosen
and Lift Out Like a Cork—Painlessly!
%
THE Australian people owe a
debt of gratitude to the wizard
in chemistry who formulated the
new ether discovery named
Frozol-Ice.
Little phials of this
wonder liquid are now
obtainable from any chem-
ist for a few pence. You
merely apply a few drops
of this Frozol-Ice on a ten-
der, aching corn or tough-
ened callous. Right away all
soreness vanishes, and soon you see the
corn or callous that loose and withered
that it lifts out with the fingers, like a
cork. Not a twinge of pain or even irritation !
is felt when using Frozol-Ice, or afterwards.
No soreness, no inflammation of surrounding
healthy flesh or skin.
Only a few pence now gives one freedom
from all and each soft corn, hard corn, corn
between the toes, likewise tender callouses on
bottom of the feet. Every Australian who
tries Frozol-Ice sings its praises, for it
honestly does not hurt one wee bit.
Step in at your chemist’s to-night and in-
sist on having a small phial of Frozol-Ice,
in the green-printed carton. Stand on “your
dig.” and refuse spurious imitations of this
great compound.
If Favorite Foods
Upset Stomach
Take Magnesia.
If some of the foods you like best do not
agree with you and make your stomach sour
or burn, producing acid indigestion, do not
think you must give up eating these good
things, and do not, either, make the mistake
of swallowing pepsin pills or sodawater after
every meal. Instead, just make a practice of
taking a teaspoonful of pure Salix Magnesia
in haif a glass of hot water right after eating.
The hot water will force a needed blood
supply to your stomach, and the Salix Mag-
nesia will instantly neutralise any excess of
stomach acid, and your digestion will be
natural and painless. Salix Magnesia is not a
laxative, and its continued use is entirely
harmless, as it never weakens natural diges-
tion. It can be obtained at any well-stocked
chemist’s shop. Be sure to get Salix Magnesia.
Do not use other forms of magnesia fp? this
purpose.

“Federationist” reports progress:—
Inferentially readers of the very timely article
“Concerning the Australian Stage” (B. 6/11/T9)
might be led to believe that the Actors’ Union,
which “recently there was a movement to form,”
had died the death of all such ventures in Aus-
tralia. This is not so.
On May 12 last an organisation called the Actors’
Federation of Australia was formed on trade-union
lines, and a certificate of registration was applied
for at the Federal Court of Arbitration and Con-
ciliation in Melbourne. The application bore the
signatures, to the number required by the statute,
of some of the best-known and most representative
players now before the public. The aim of these
players was the remedying of the abuses The
Bulletin speaks of, and of many others. Their
bona fides was unquestioned and unquestionable.
The application, which is required by law to lie
in the Registrar’s office for 30 days after being
lodged, was opposed almost at the last moment by
the combined managers through their union, the
Theatrical Managers’ Association. The Registrar,
after hearing the various objections, saw no reason
for withholding a certificate to the Federation, and
decided to issue it. This decision was at once

challenged by the managers, who appealed against
it. This caused a delay of a couple of months.
When the matter came up in the Arbitration Court
before Justice Higgins the managers won on a
technical point, the Judge deciding that one of the
somewhat hastily drawn up rules of the new body
did not comply with the statute. The Federation
thereupon was de-registered. The executive decided
to try again. The rules were amended to comply with
the Act, and a fresh application was made to the
Industrial Registrar in the beginning of October.
Another 30 days had to elapse. Again, up to the
last moment, the actors were led to believe there
would be no opposition, but once more the managers
lodged objections, the hearing of which has yet to
take place.
What the ultimate result may be is therefore in
doubt, but that an honest attempt by the leaders of
the profession to better their conditions of employ-
ment is being made and persisted in, in the face of
bitter opposition by the managerial forces, is beyond
question. This plain statement of the matter will
give some slight idea as to what the new movement
is up against and the reasons for its slow progress.
It is hardly correct to say that “the opposition
to it was almost as solid amongst the better-paid
actors and actresses as it was on the part of the
managements.” At least four performers now being
“starred” and half a dozen “featured” on play-bills
are members of the Federation. There are always,
unfortunately, some people who prefer to “wait and
see.” But it is perhaps hardly fair to blame the
followers of a very precarious calling who have the
fate of former actors’ unions and unionists in mem-
ory, and in addition are subject to covert threats
as to what is likely to happen to them and their
engagements if they attempt to disturb the old
order of things. But that many of them are short-
sighted cannot be denied. Those, for example, who
still support the Actors’ Association, a moribund
institution kept alive in the interests of the bosses
for the sake of a so-called equity contract, which
contract they (the bosses) subscribe to—which, in-
deed, they were instrumental in framing. Only the
other day in Sydney a benefit performance was ten-
dered (I quote the newspaper advertisements) “to
the Actors’ Association by the Theatrical Managers’

“Ox”: Died on Nov. 3, at Orange
(N.S.W.), Harry (“Ginger”) Beaumont,
actor. He played many good parts in his
time, and played them well, but he never
had a role that equalled in interest his own
mottled career. Ilis last engagement was
with Philip Lytton.
osa Opera Co., which is being
multiplied to play seasons of a month or
more in each of the large provincial towns
of England, talks of extending its operations.
In a projected tour a year will be spent
working through Australia and America,
with South Africa thrown in somewhere.
There are three full Carl Rosa cos. at pre-
sent.
“Fax”: It wasn’t faecessary for Maud
Fane, recently back from London, to assure
us that “the Australian chorus-girl is easily
ahead of her London sister, by reason of her
sparkle and dash, her graceful deportment,
her intelligence, and the ease with which she
is able to step into a part when required.”
What we want to know is why so many
sparkling, dashing, graceful and intelligent
Australian chorus-girls waste all their stage
days in the chorus, while English and Ameri-
can ladies, who have graduated from
choruses abroad, are imported to play prin-
cipal parts. This country, seemingly,
should be able to more than supply its own
needs in the matter of comic-opera prin-
cipals. It ought to be exporting them.
“Biobox”: “The Belle of New York” has
got into the movies, but Australia will find
it hard to reconcile the film with the gay
musical comedy. The belle doesn’t go Salv’-
armying, but gets into cabaret life and runs
to earth the villain of the piece, who is no
less a person than old man Bronson, the re-
former of Cahoesi . Under a mask of piety
he has robbed the belle’s father of the secret
of a money-making invention. The Polite
Lunatic appears to have retired to his padded
cell.
“Ike Pagliacci”: In the longest-part con-
test I put my money on Mary in “What
Happened to Mary” to beat L’Aiglon. As
played in the Bert Bailey production by Kate
Howarde’s daughter, Leslie Adrien, Mary
came on just after the rise of the curtain,
and thereafter never left, except for one
brief flit to make a costume change.
The Golden Wattle Films (Sydney) have
secured the picture -rights of Bland Holt’s
“Breaking of the Drought.” It is to be all-
Australian. The success enjoyed by “The
Lure of the Bush” and “The Sentimental
Bloke” is encouraging the local industry.
Several well-known N. S. Wales squatters
appear in the lately-completed first of the
Carroll-Baker film productions. Amongst
them are Major Wills-Alien, Captain Darcy
Donken, Wilfred Lucas, Brownie Vernon,
Captain Malcolm McKellar and Eric
McKellar, who are for ex-
hibitions of stirring horsemanship. Snowy
Baker uses the big grey horse so much
admired in “The Lure of the Bush.”
“Glen Huntly”: It looks as if Bernard
Shaw has “shot his bolt” as a playwright.
A new volume of his plays contains three
one-acters—“The Inca )of Perusalem,”
“Great Catherine” and “Augustus Does His
Bit” —all of which were staged in London
without much benefit to the box office, and
one long effort, “Heartbreak House,” which
has not been produced in either England or
the U.S.A., presumably for what managers
consider sound financial reasons. The Vic-
torian Socialist party sent a cable recently
to Pshaw asking him to visit Australia for
a lecturing tour “on his own terms.” He
refused, on the ground that “only a body of
capitalists could pay them.” When last an
attempt was made to get him here he re-
plied, “Why should I leave civilisation?”
“0.K.”: Amy Castles got her introduc-
tion to “La Bohfeme” this way. The tenor of
the co. suddenly became ill of fish-poisoning.
He was sweethearting with the young Italian
prima donna who had been imported to sing
Mimi, and as he couldn’t appear he com-
manded his girl not to appear either. Amy
was persuaded to sing the part at very brief
notice, and shd got through with hardly a
mistake. Still, to have the music of a
popular modern opera in mind is not an
astonishing accomplishment. Why, there
was handsome veteran tenor Berthold, im-
ported by George Musgrove to sing Lohen-
grin and Tannhauser, who was said to know
100 principal tenor parts in grand opera,
most of them in two or three languages.
He could be rung up in the morning to play
any of the 100 parts at night, and if he
didn’t happen to know it in the language
of the other performers he would sing it in
a foreign tongue.

llrr n,.. Misg Colbourne Baber (B.
* , , , , 10 • 4 . hp Intp whiles
13/11/T9) burst on us in the late eighties
in “Maritana, produced at the teyaney Ln.
by Itignold and Allison. That firm was the
first to use the Park-street playhouse,
“Falka,” with Billgreeno Verdi and Emilie
Melville in the principal parts, being tne
opera. George Dean, was in the
cast, and so were Edwin Kelly and Edward
Allen. The last-named was a light tenor,
who left the W., G. and M. chorus to play
a boy-girl. When the curtain rang down on
“p a ika” Rignold and Allison put up
,Maritana” with the new prima donna, and
jjer singing carried the Wallace opera into
smoo th waters. Colbourne Baber had a
sweet voice, but she could not act, and her
attempts at dancing the few steps allotted to
the gipsy girl were cru( j e . Armes Beau-
mont was Don Csesar, and, although his
voice was then frayed, he had a great per-
sonal triumph. The manner in which he
helped the youthful prima donna out of the
pits was an object-lesson to the profession
whose members are not always keen in help-
ing beginners. Besides, in this case the
lady had jumped over the heads of more ex-
perienced singers, and in a way that wasn’t
exactly relished.
“Kaylee”: Stage hands and musicians
helped Uncle Sam’s actors to win the strike
which began on August 7 and ended Sep-
tember 6 after an all-night conference um-
pired by playwright Augustus Thomas. The
peace agreement gave the actors everything
they fought for.. Money hardly entered into
the matter: it was a struggle for better con-
ditions backed by celebrities of the calibre of
the Barrymores. The strikers ran one N.
York theatre with a bill of stars more
luminous than any that had ever got together
under one roof, and proceeds went to chase
the wolf from the doors of the small-part
people and chorus-girls. Those managers
who were able to keep their theatres open
had to face the opposition of free shows
given on the side-walk by talented strikers.
Morris Gest kept his big “Chu Chin Chow”
co. together for a time by herding them into
expensive restaurants, where they ate at the
management’s expense; but he was beaten
in the end. A striking actress aeroplaned over
the city dropping leaflets. William A. Brady
went back to the boards after 25 years’
absence to help out his_ own show. Most
interesting of all the strikers was Helen
Keller, the deaf, dumb and blind girl who
has become associated with the theatre per
the movies.
Brudder Jack Johnson, who is now un-
able to find a face to poke his fist into, has
been acting for a small movie co. in Barce-
lona, Spain. The first of his efforts, a 12-
reeler, entitled “Fuerte” (Strength), is
making a European tour.
“0.K.”: The Barrens are outliving the
Einerys and the Kembles in their connection
with tlie English stage. When a drama en-
titled “Edmund Kean” was produced in Man-
chester a while ago one of the parts was
played by William Barren, whose grand-
father acted with Kean; and his great-grand-
father, who acted with Garrick, was the
descendant of an “elder Farren.” There seems
to have been a line of “elder Farrens.” The
present William is the son or grandson of a
capital comedian who was billed as “William
Farren, jun.,” five and forty years ago, when
there were some notable revivals of old Eng-
lish plays at the London Vaudeville, then un-
der the management of Thorne and James
(David Belasco, by the way, is the son of
David James). Barren played Sir Peter
Teazle, Hardeastle, Old Dorrington (“The
Road to Ruin”), etc., and people said lie was
almost as clever as his father. His father
figured in theatrical records as “the elder
Farren, contemporary with Macready,” so
the paternal relative must have been a very
junior Farren to the one who acted with
Garrick, seeing that Garrick was born 77
years before Macready. Nellie Farren, the
Gaiety burlesque star, daughter of Henry,
was a grand-daughter of the contemporary of
Macready, and cousin to the William Farren
whom I remember. The Farren-Soutars of
to-day are her children. As for the Miss Far-
ren, also of the stage, who married an Earl
of Derby, I don’t know whether she belonged
to the family or had borrowed the name for
stage purposes. In any case the ancient race
of Derby was lucky to get hold of her.
“T. D. Emdee” : Though George W. Anson
was for so long with the Firm, he came to
Australia with Henry Alleyne and Florence
Wade, who opened a Sydney season at the
New Opera House, in York and King streets.
The co. staged the old comedies, and Anson
appeared as Charley Spraggs (“Blow for
Blow”) and Grimaldi. He was great in
both characters, but recollections of Fred
Marshall were too fresh, and the season was
a failure. At this time Brough and Bouci-
cault either had launched or were about to
launch their venture, and the Firm snapped
up Anson to replace Brough. He was cast
for Poskit in Pinero’s play, and was as good
in the part as Brough, the Australian crea-
tor. The original made Poskit dry parch-
ment ; Anson made him unctuous. Hans
Phillips replaced Boucicault as the boy, Cis
Farringdon. Nothing came astray to An-
son. His Farmer Kirke in “Hazel Kirke,”
with pretty Maggie Knight in the name-part,
was one of the best pieces of pathetic acting
I have seen in 40 years. He drew a Jew
unlike every other stage Jew—a real Jew,
not a thing of paint, nose and accent
mostly wrong. George Bryant, who was in
“The Magistrate” with him, cites Anson as
the best he has seen, and some of Anson’s
old-man touches were noticeable in Bryant’s
sketch of the curmudgeon at the Sydney
Palace recently. I can imagine how weil
Anson would play Captain Hook in “Peter
Pan,” in which, so a recent Poverty Point
par said, he is appearing in London.
A new London revue contains an idea
which Australia might easily adopt. It is
the simple one of reviving old and popular
songs, a player dressed in character taking
each. “They All Love Jack,” “I Love a
Lassie” and “Mrs. ’Enry ’Awkins” seem to
have been the most rapturously received; but
the list could be extended infinitely.
“Piwa”: Why does the travelling piano-
tuner of the Backblocks usuallv stipulate that
the instrument shall not be played upon for
three days after the overhauling process? Is
there some scientific principle involved, or
is it simply that the “expert” wants three
days’ start?

"ON TOP" WITH
MICK SIMMONS
SURE CATCH TACKLE
Two of the winners at Caulfield last
Saturday—two-year-old Multi and three-year-old
Wilduu —were sired respectively by Almissa and
Eudorus, English horses that did some successful
racing in Australia before going to the stud. Alniissa
won the Moonee Valley and Australian Cups in
1913, the same year that Eudorus captured the rich
Futurity Stakes. Both of them, apparently, are
going to pay their way handsomely in the paternity
line of business, but it is hardly likely that little
Almissa will get any actual top-notchers, or that
the children of Eudorus will be remarkable for
stamina. He was a handsome horse, with a disincli-
nation for a distance.
The steeplechase at Caulfield brought an
inquiry by the stewards as to why the winner had
run a very bad race on the same course five days
previously." The secret examination of owner, trainer
and jockey resulted in the same old unsatisfactory
decision to take no action. These crudely contra-
dictory performances in jumping' races are much more
glaring than anything that ever happens on the fiat,
vet the public, as a rule, seems to take them as a
matter of course. Generally speaking, the triers in
a hurdle or steeple can be distinguished from the
non-triers almost from the start. In a field of 12
perhaps half the dozen might as well be pulled up
in the first furlong for all the pretence their jockeys
are making of any effort to catch the leaders, or
keep within reasonable distance of them, These
laggards may be honestly out-paced, or so short of
condition that it would be risking a fall to push
them along. But in a good many cases they are
being held back by arrangement. From the end of
August to the beginning of May next year,
when the best of the jumpers return to duty, Mel-
bourne’s racing over the sticks should be a matter
for more inquiry and disqualification than lias
happened hitherto.
If all gees raced as consistently as
Chrome the uncertainty of the turf would be insuffici-
ently glorious. Since Chrome returned to notice in
the early Spring he has served as a guide to form, on
the understanding always that the big, clumsy fel-
low was comparatively better under a heavy weight,
with a man on his back, than when he carried a boy.
The story of the Bright Steel horse, since he ran
third to Lucknow and Night Watch in the Caulfield
Cup, is a study in consistency. Getting a bad run
in the Hothain Handicap at Flemington on Derby
Day, he finished only fourth to Seabound, King of
the Sea and Menin, giving them from 161 b. to 251 b.
Boy Duncan was the rider, and again Duncan was
up when Chrome finished fifth in the Melbourne Cup
behind Lucknow, who was just pipped by Two Blues.
Four days later he won the V.H.C. Handicap from
Two Blues and British Arch, meeting T.B. on nearly
2st. worse terms than in the Melbourne Cup, but
having now the advantage of Frank Bullock’s jockey-
ship. On the Monday he was out again for the Wil-
liamstown Cup, which proved a gift for Richmond
Main, who had beaten him in_ the big Melbourne
event. 'Chrome finished third this time, and, though
King of the Sea beat him again, he was coming with
a rush at the finish. Last Saturday, in the Armadale
Gup at CGulfield (worth £loioo to the winner), Chrome
had another go at his old opponents, King of the
Sea, British Arch and Menin. Two of them were
placed in the first four whilst Chrome was winning
from the Tasmanian mare Ordella. He carried
9st. 21b. and did the mile and a half in 2min. 34 : }sec.
A great battler is Chrome. His running bears testi-
mony to the soundness of the form in the Caulfield
Cup ; and in beating him so easily in the Williams-
town Cup, Richmond Main confirmed the excellence
of Artilleryman, if any confirmation was needed.
Ordella. by Positano, is a most respectable
half-sister to Comedy King. With Chrome out of
the wav she would have carried Bst. 101 b. into first
place for the Armadale Cup, but the pace was faster
than she had been used to in Tasmania, so she
hardly stayed the 12 furlongs, and her chance of a
fifth consecutive victory was gone.
With Artilleryman out of the way Coin-
cidence would have achieved a great triumph in the
Melbourne Cup, for the race was run on Richmond
Main’s birthday. Also there was a story flying
around of a man who dreamed that Richmond Main
would win the Cup whilst he (the dreamer) lay
coffined in the cold ground, and the first part of the
gloomy double had duly come off. Also it was a fact
that the respective mothers of two crack iwo-year-
olds in Seobie’s stable had each given birth to a
child on the day when her young offspring won its
first race. The way thus seemed quite clear for the
tiiumph of Coincidence. But the backers of that
gay deceiver lost their money. They rarely win, if
the truth were known; though w hen they do, as in
the case of Nimblefoot for the Melbourne Cup, the
books take care to noise the fact abroad. Bookmakers
are great advertisers of racing dreams and portents.
A famous coincidence that went astray occurred in
connection with Prince Charlie for the English
Derby. Prince Charlie (the sire of Lochiel, the
great contemporary of Carbine) had been the fastest
English horse of his time, if not of any time. He
stood over 17 hands high, and had such beautiful
action that he never seemed to be exerting himself.
As a youngster he started in the two principal two-
year-old events only, and won them easily. His
first appearance next season was in the Two
Thousand Guineas, and he won that. So, though lie
was touched in his wind the gigantic Prince Charlie
was thought to be invincible, and when somebody
noticed that the Derby was to be run on May 29
Prince Charlie’s Day, the anniversary of ti.e day
when Charles the First’s heir (the subsequent friend
of Kell Gwynne and others) hid in an oak-tree
whilst Cromwell’s troopers were looking for him—
his victory seemed as good as certain. If coincidence
amounted to a row of pins Prince Charlie was home
and dried. But the flier didn’t win. The defect in
his breathing arrangements was too strong for coin-
cidence. lie finished fifth only, the most backward
position he ever filled in his life. Still, superstition
gets an occasional win. There’s a well authenticated
story of the man who was driving past a pub called
the Wellington, in Piccadilly, on his way to a
Derby of long ago. Sir Joseph Hawley was the
leading racehorse owner of that time and he was
running a horse called Ellington. The morning was
wet; a damp flag hanging from a window of the
pub had neatly obscured the front letter of “Well-
ington” from the punter’s view, and there was the
correct tip staring him in the face. Ellington! He
backed the gee to win him a fortune and lived happy
ever after.
Undoubtedly the turf smells sweeter for
that unprecedented finish to the Caulfield Cup race,
where three stable companions, in three different
ownerships, each carried “stable money.” Before
the Melbourne Cup came to pass the local dailies
published an official statement that nobody con-
nected with Bradfield’s stable bad taken Night
Watch or Chrome in a double with Lucknow, but
no shrewd students of the race-game ever questioned
the honesty of the go for the Caulfield event. The
three stable companions were all out to win, with
out regard to the fact that the winner would be at
the disadvantage of a 101 b. penalty in the subsequent
handicap. When some years ago stable-companions
Poseidon and Apologue ran first and second for t. e
Caulfield Cup, everybody suspected that the life
Ike Earnshaw and his colleagues in the matter had
backed Poseidon and Apologue for the “double,” and
everybody’s suspicion was justified by results. Some
people, of course, are never convinced that stable
companions are playing cut-throat euchre; therefore
if Night Watch or Chrome had won Melbourne Cup
instead of finishing behind the penalised Lucknow, it
would have been a case of “What did I tell you? ’
with the wiseacres. Even if jockey Bullock hadn’t
discovered the shortage of a lead-bag on his mount
after he had started to go to the post, there would
have been a suggestion that the Caulfield winner was
out to lose this time in favor of a stable companion.
Had the jockey not noticed something wrong Luck-
now would certainly have finished third for Melbourne
Cup, and have been disqualified for failing to draw
the weight. The missing lead-bag, which is said to
have been mysteriously pinched, weighed Gib., and
with that off’ his back Lucknow wouldn’t have been
beaten a head by Two Blues for third place.
Hundreds of place-punters, going to collect their
even money or 6 to "i on the favorite, would have
i found that' Lucknow’s place win was “off.” And
then how would they have performed?

As a consistent loser the grey importation
The Destroyer qualified for first prize long ago.
Taking matters by and large there must have been
enough money lost on him to pay the Diggers’ peace
gratuity. He has been boomed for big races and
for little ’uns; has been started after getting sound
preparations and after no preparation at all—and
never yet has he done any good. The calamitous
quadruped had another try among a Trial Stakes lot
at Rosehill on Saturday. He was again a hot favor-
ite—and again did he inspect the concluding phase
from a remote position astern. There are people
who will back anything with a tail —or anything
a tale is told about.
* * * *
In two successive weeks a strange nag
has appropriated the Flying on Sydney suburban
courses. Saturday’s apparition at. Rosehill was a
gelding named Gooeearbo, several times a winner at
country meetings. An appetising market was made
by the public wildly rushing in with cash for Ready,
Aye Ready. Also there was good money for Goonhilly.
Some unobtrusive strangers were able, accordingly,
to sample Gooeearbo at 12’s and 10’s. But they didn't
get away with anything "like the wad annexed by
the little crowd that brought Malt Annie over from
Vic. and had a spin at Canterbury the previous Satur-
day That lot kept going as long as Ike would write
a ticket and likewise dropped on every s.p. merchant
in the State.
In the Gee-Gee Stead Memorial Stakes

last day of the Canterbury meeting, Gloaming walked

“Hamer” : A friend who haunts the courses
regularly makes a point of only risking 10s. If he
loses he shuts up and becomes an onlooker. If he
wins he doubles his tote bets each race. Last Satur-
day he had a unique run of luck at Rosebery with-
out striking a single winner. His 10 bob went on
the third horse in the Novice Handicap (first divi-
sion), winning him £2 6s. 6d. The doubled money
on the second division, put on Master Paddington,
brought him £1 10s. 6d. A£2 w 7 ad on Will Shine
in the Flying won him £37 10s., although the horse
only ran third. He struck the second horse in the
Approved Stakes, v T hich, paying £6 95., gave him
£5l 125., and the third in the Fourteen-One, which
yielded £4O. By this time he had about £123 in his
pocket, and thinking his luck exhausted he keyed
his betting down to £1 investments, yet managed
to add another fiver without striking a winner! If
he had backed the first horses on the same doubling
principle he would have won a bare £25. The only
miss in good dividends he had was in the second
race, in which the third horse paid out £S 17s. 6d.
on the 10 bob tote.

Foremost was asked to carry lOst. lib.
and expected to win the Two-year-old Handicap at
the Q.T.C. meeting, but could get no closer than
third. The winner was Oriel (Seremond —Olive
Bud), to whom she was conceding a quarter of a
hundredweight! Watt’s Derby failure Bright
Night took the. Flying, and the King’s Plate (11 mile
w.f.a.) went to Ilad-i-Wist, who started at odds
on, as this is his favorite distance.
The finish of the fourth round of Sydney
grade cricket sees Wests, with 13 points, leading
Gordon by a point, with Glebe still very much at
the tail of tile hunt.
Wests beat Petersham on the first innings by 103.
They carried their unfinished effort of two for 1 1 4
to 271 before succumbing to Adams (four for 64)
and Garner (four for 68). Pete’s second go re-
sulted in seven for 175 (Emery 47 and Andrews 46).
Arnott's four wickets cost only 14 runs apiece.
Carter rather unwisely allowed Waverley to con-
tinue batting on the sodden, though improving,
pitch against Sydney, and four wickets fell for 31
before lie declared. Sydney had lost six for 61 by
the time the pubs shut (Ives four for 21) ; Waverley
the winners (on the first) by 95. Rain prevented
Middle Harbor from showing its batting strength,
and gave Norths a first innings win by 72 runs.
Norths had a hit in their second innings and lost
seven for 125 (Hall 46).
Uni. spared C. Cumberland Riley’s batting, and
declared at their last Saturday’s score of nine
wickets for 420. The best C.C. could do in
response was 181 (Trenerry seven for 92). Follow-
ing on the Orangemen lost six for 145 (R. Best 59
n. 0.). This time Trenerry took five for 58. So Uni.
won by 239. Glebe, following on after amassing
38 runs in reply to Paddington’s 138, succeeded at
their second attempt in piling together 68. Norman
(six for 40) and Noble (four for 19), assisted by
the field, got the wickets. Not a single batsman
had his stumps dis-
turbed. Gordon
looked like register-
ing a record score
with but three wic-
kets down for 203,
in contrast to Bal-
main’s 149. But
they only added 42
for the remaining
seven wickets,
mainly owing to
Folkard’s bowling
(four for 241. Balds
second strike pro-
duced 105, Andy
Ratcliffe showing
m a r k e d disrespect
for the bowling (53).
Martin was Gordon’s
best bowler —four
for 17. Gordon got
the required 10 runs
without loss.
ALICK
BANNERMAN,

at the Sydney
Cricket
Ground.
“The Pariah”: Jack Harry, the Vic.
inter-State cricketer who drew stumps in Bendigo
the other day, claimed to be the only man who had
taken wickets in a first-class match with both hands.
Skipper Blackham, during a match, remarked that
he wished he had a left-hander. Jack, who had
taken three wickets with his right hand, volunteered
to fill the gap, and got two wickets with his left.
Even when over 40 he could turn down a good left-
hand ball. In Bendigo cricket he and Harry Trott
made things interesting, and were responsible for
the development of many promising colts. In 10
years Jack went to the wickets 209 times for an
average, of 37.16. As a bowler he delivered 4145
balls for 107 wickets and 1729 runs. He used to
play for East Melbourne. Once he was chosen for an
English tour, but owing to snobbery was dropped at
the last moment. He was a great run-getter on the
leg, and his advice to youngsters was, “There’s only
one man on the leg, and if the bowler gives you a
leg ball put all you know on to it —it’s bad luck
if you’re Having bowled against him I
know that he took his own advice.

There were some bright features in Mel-
bourne district erickct on Saturday. St. Kilda’s
280 for nine (innings declared closed) was reckoned
a big contract for ’Rov, but Iviernan got 123 arid
Cody a faultless 103 n. 0., and the lively suburb won
by 54 with two wickets to spare. Carlton's easy
margin of T 55 over Uni. was due to Down’s 109
n.o. and the Students’ butter-fingered work in the
field. In the second hits ’Varsity lost five for 107
(Park 53 and Le Couteur 37), the annoying Truman
coming out with a fine aggregate of 11 for 65.
Melbourne achieved an outright win of nine wickets
against Northcote. ’Cote, could add only 117 to
their first score of 137, and Melbourne, realising 198,
needed 57, which were compiled mostly by Arm-
strong and Onyons in 23 minutes. South’s victory
of 26 over ’Wood was not inspiring, South’s only
gleam being the partnership between Grimmett and
Anderson. This produced 74 and won the match.
East, fading away before the onslaught of the Rich-
mond attack (Smith five for 24 and Collins four for
79), notched only 155, to which old Pete McAlister
contributed 56, and were 118 in arrears when the
last stick fell. P’ran, which was mostly Healey
(149 n. 0.) and Bowden (83), closed at 329 for eight
against North, who seemed destined for heavy pun-
ishment when their response stood at six for 38; but
for once North’s tail wagged valiantly) and reduced
the final deficit to 156.
* » • *
The match Diggers v. Dost of N.S.'W.
will give the selectors some idea of the inter-State
possibilities of several of the neglected division.
Trenerry’s bowling will have a chance of justifying
itself, and so will Norman’s, while Bogle, K. B.
Docker, Tozer and Kippax may or may not repeat
their club batting form against a stiller opposition.
But why is young Punch out of “The Rest’s” team?
Left-hander Rex Norman (Paddington)
took 13 wickets for 57 runs against Glebe in the
last round —the best Sydney first-grade effort of the
present season. Norman is chosen in N. S. Wales’s
XI against the Diggers this week-end and against
Queensland next week, and in the dearth of great
left-handers in Australian cricket has more than an
outside chance of bigger rep. honors. #
In Adelaide cricket East Torrens and
Port Adelaide are leading, having each played three
matches and wbn them all. Sturt has won two, and
had the bad luck to lose the other by a single run.
The others have all lost more than they have won,
Adelaide Club, with a strong team on paper, not
having had a win at all yet.

Iv. Ntinkler (Consul for Finland) pushed
aside official cares at Sydney on Saturday and hurled
the javelin 159 ft. 4win. at East Sydney A.A.A.
championship meeting. This is about 1 2ft. better
than D. Osborne’s previous best Australian perform-
ance at Sydney a few weeks ago. Naukler also had
a turn with the 161 b. shot, and heaved it 37ft. - jln -
There was an emotional scene at Sydney
Stadium on Saturday night when, at the end of 26
rounds of earnest stoush, .Toe Itallis announced that
Frankie Dailey, the Yankee feather, had beaten
Jamito, of the Philippines. The baser members of
the crowd expressed their disapproval by hoots,
oaths and threats. The 15s. waters looked pained.
Jamito’s expressive countenance became convulsed,
and he beat upon the ropes to indicate the anguish
he was feeling. Actually it was a level thing.
Jamito led often, but he landed infrequently, be
is a more spectacular and energetic boxer than the
other boy, and he is a comedian, and so the heart
of the|populace goes out to him. A draw would per-
haps have been the best decision.
The Adelaide to Melbourne motor-cycle
record had a lump knocked off it by Corner, the
South Aus. rider, recently. He rode a Stock Power-
plus Indian shod with Dunlop tyres, and covered the
journey in 19hr. 35min., reducing the previous record
by 41ir. 47min.
S. Australia’s team at the inter-State
tennis matches in Melbourne this week-end includes
some Young blood. A. R. Taylor, R. V. Thomas,
.1. L. O’Dea and F. E. Barritt are not new to the
big contests, but R. L. Billing and C. Gurner are
juniors who have played themselves into the team
this season.
Queensland squatter Mick Ryan, owner
of Earl Kitchener, Boy Syce and a string of others,
was recently approached to contest Bareoo —T. J.
Ryan’s old seat- —in opposition to Labor. Mick
wired back: “No thanks. No chance, llarcoo. Be
on Artilleryman Melbourne Cup.”
“The Oldest Inhabitant”: Do side-shows
on Flemingttm at Clip-time differ much from those
of early days?” I have often been asked. I saw the
first Cup run, and before that the first Champion
Race (October, 1859), taken by Flying Buck, owned
by IV. C. Yuill, and ridden by a mite of a boy,
Harry Yeend. On that occasion we did not go to
the course by rail; there was none. The low-backed
cars and ’buses wanted at the lowest half a crown
each, and half a crown meant something in those
days. Most of us “hoofed” it round the head of the
swamp, where we found that an ingenious speculator
had destroyed a small rustic bridge, which lay across
a water-course, and placed a plank at another
point, which cost us 6d. each to cross. Also, he
had a barrel of water on tap which cost Id. per
glass, and for those “in the know” there was some-
thing stronger. On the course we found a large tent,
with a platform erected outside. Here the pugilists
of the day gave exhibitions —Harry Sellars, Joe
Kitchen, Charley Brock, Bill Eccleston, Fred Smith
and minor lights. The “patterer” was a little Jew
who later appeared as the first bookmaker under
the clock at Kirk’s Bazaar, Sammy Isaacs by name.
Placing a “pointer” on the breast of each blushing
pugilist, he would describe his performances in the
ring. Between the races there would be glove
fights in the tent. The show was well patronised,
though the ring was then going down in public
favor. At that time the grandstand, very primitive,
was on the river side. The hill had not then been
annexed, though it was the resort of thousands to
witness the races. About 40,000 people witnessed
the first Champion Race. The jockey was introduced
to Governor Barkly, who made him a present of his
purse and its contents.
* * * *
“Barney”: Dunno the relative two-up
merits of English and Australian pennies, because I
rarely saw pennies spun in big schools. At Moasear,
with three or four hundred punters and half-a-dozen
rings, the ringkeepers invariably used a dice-box and
three traybits. I saw the trays turn up 19 times
on one occasion, and there was always good money
for anyone who could do “a trot.”
F. H. Pearce, an English lawn-tennis um-
pire of long experience, proposes a simple plan for
cutting down the enormous length to which a match
can run. That most matches should be* over in a
certain calculable time, but that one here and there
should run to almost unlimited length, is not fair to
the players; and it throws out all the plans for
fitting games in at a given hour. The Pearce plan
is that after a game gets to deuce, it should go to
anyone winning two points consecutively. Similarly
with games in a set. This is quite possibly the idea
with which deuce and ’vantage were introduced, and
in private games many people score that way under
the impi’ession that it is the rule.
PERFECTLY SIMPLE.

Before the Race Ball really started at
Government House a waxwork show was
given on the canopied dais. All round were
stationed intent and deferential aides from
everywhere, politely bending. It appears
that everyone had forgotten the moves of
the lancers —the ancient square dance of
officialdom —so someone had arranged the
waxworks to give the two-steppers a lead.
The gaudy dress effects of several returned
trippers gave a fancy-dress air to the vice-
regal and other dances. Two sisters looked
exactly as if they had dressed for the parts
of Cinderella’s step-sisters. One wore an
emerald-green satin skirt, with a front split
and a fishtail ending in a tassel, an
abbreviated bodice of gold lace and a heavy
head-dress. The other fluttered in vivid pink
skirts, topped by a fierce blue-and-gold bodice
swathe and a glittering blue crown. The
smartest evening gowns this season seldom
continue above the bust-line in front and the
waist-line at the back. Another showy head
sported a lofty coiffure swathed in what ap-
peared to be a red towel skewered in front
with a flaunting feather.
Mrs. Stein invited ladies to a boudoir
party of champagne and sandwiches, then
took them into the balconies of the Town
Hall to listen to the speeches at Uncle’s
inaugural dinner. The new Mayoress is
tall and slender, with auburn hair. She
was smartly gowned in black, and hung the
Southern Cross in diamonds from her ears.
The guests were all in their very best frocks.
Mrs. Arnold Westley wore a jet gown and
some large peai’ls. Mrs. Cabena kept to the
background in quiet grey. Mrs. Woolf came
out for the first time since her illness.
Councillor Hardy’s wife was a vision of
white satin and diamonds. Mrs. Burston
brought a bevy of daughters, and Alderman
Jeffries’s pretty girls also listened. The
Weedon dame’s grey tulle gown had a sash
of blended colors. City fathers ascended to
the balcony at times through the speech-
making and showed off their costumes of
black cloth, real lace and gold-buckled shoes.
But the most overdressed diners grew pale
when it was seen that Lieut.-Governor
Irvine was practically corseted in gold.
Gaud Mayor Aikman was laden with robes
and chains. General White’s quiet khaki
blazed with decorations, and ex-Ma.vor
Weedon got great satisfaction out of the
long frills of lace on his black cuffs.
In England the Monashes paid visits to
the summer homes of Sir Arthur Walsh and
Lord Sandhurst. Queen Mary had lent
Lady, Sandhurst Aberfeldy Castle for the
summer, the were asked up
for a week. King George had said in a
friendly way' that he Imped to see more of
them there, “as our place is next door.”
The Australian General and his wife also
put ip. a week -or dat the Northeote dame’s
house in Iverti P hicess Alice and her hus-
band; the ny • of Athlone, were in the
housf ; party. They also had an interesting
visitf of the /House of Commons, and chats
with Winston Clnrvliill, Milner and others.
Their cards were for the Speaker’s private
(ladies’)r gallery. They expected to meet
some other women there, but found that
they had a box to themselves. It was a
secluded corner with small Gothic arches
like windows without glass to look through.
The Monash girleen said she felt like Mary
of Scots about to be beheaded. The
General was away on the opposite side of
the House in the Distinguished Strangers’
Gallery, and daughter Bertha longed to
coo-ee —“only,” as she remarked, “my family
is devoid of humor.” The correct dress for
the ladies’ gallery, by the way, is full
evening wear.
Among the debs, at the vice-regal ball
Manser, daughter of the late
Majwfik Manser, a Royal Engineer officer
with ii distinguished record, who died in
Melbourne about three years ago. Ilis wife
was Mrs, Agar Wynne’s only daughter by
her first marriage. Peggy is a charming
young miss who is doing her second-year
medicine.
Owen Cox and his niece have been feted
by the Government House folk all through
the race-season festivities. But the knight
retained his detached air under all provo-
cations.
Mrs. Ross Soclen gave one of the big dances
of the season. Grong Grong, the Toorak
home of the family., opened all its windows
and doors on to the terraces and gardens,
uncovered the carefully-padded door of the
ballroom and had a real after-the-war party.
It was an unclouded revel, for all the
widow’s soldier sons had returned, and son
Gordon had brought a bride. The bride
wore exquisite drapings of ivory brocade and
a pint or two of pearls. The hostess wore
blue satin and diamonds. All the men-
guests were returned warriors. They wore
mufti with their proud scars. Supper was
an affair of turkey and champagne served in
the dining-room. The hostess is a noted
gardener, and the house bloomed with
flowers she had coaxed along on many an
early gardening morning. The eldest son
came down from the station up north for
the frivol, then bolted back to the problem
of starving sheep and drought.
The widow of Capt. Evelyn Ffrench is
being welcomed back to Australia after seven
years’ absence. The youngest daughter of
late V.R.C. starter George Watson, she was
a noted horsewoman before going to Eng-
land to marry her soldier. His mother was
a Miss Wilson, niece of the late flame-whis-
kered Samuel. Capt. Ffrench started his
career in the British Army, later tried farm-
ing in Westralia, and then helped run a
Thames-side school to train young men for
life “in the colonies.” At intervals he wrote
verses —good verses, too. At one stage he
and his wife went on the halls in London
and on the Continent with a stockwhip turn
and other acts. His stage-name was Geof-
frey Silant. The versatile soldier saw Arma-
geddon through before meeting his death
whilst testing a new aeroplane in Blighty.
The other Monday afternoon Mrs. Jack
Molesworth hostessed an afternoon At Home
for the most exclusive people. It was a glad
affair, at which professional musicians,
headed by John Amadio, supplied good ac-
companiments to the tea, strawberries and
gossip. The hostess, who had to cancel all
previous frivols owing to sickness, looked hand-
some in pale-grey Jersey cloth. The guest
of honor was Mrs. Molesworth’s cousin,
Mrs. Douglas, second daughter of the late
surgeon Fitzgerald. Mrs. Douglas and her
husband, the General, arrived from India last
month on a visit to her Melbourne relatives.
John Lang, who has sold Eurack, is mov-
ing the family pianola over to the old Watch
Hill homestead, where the Robertsons reigned
until the high cost of squatting lately caused
the chopping-up of the property into farmers’
blocks.
The latest social diversion was a band
strike. At a big private dance two or-
chestras had been engaged—an everyday or-
chestra to start with, and a special jazz band
to come on at midnight. When the plain band
discovered this it refused to play. So until
midnight some amateur thumped a piano
dragged in from the nursery.
Rene Lowe, B.Sc., B.Ag.Sc., is the pro-
fessional label on the jolly young farmeress
pictured by Ruth Holliek. Miss Lowe is
the only girl who
lias been through
Dookie Agricultural
College. She was a
Bachelor of Science
at Melb. University,
and went in for an
Agricultural Science
degree. This had
been regarded as a
man’s job, and when
she discovered' that
the course included a
season at an agricul-
tural college she did
not baulk, but drove
a furrow clear
through practical
and science -work
alike. The j ; oung
lady is sturdily
built and is just under five feet high. The
hat she is wearing in the picture is a
treasured relic of working days—a battered
old “felt” tied with string. Miss Lowe
liked the field work so much that she con-
fesses she cried when she left the college.
However, the University had offered her a
good job as Demonstrator of Bacteriology,
and she is now at work in town. But she
feels that if anyone wanted an experienced
manageress for a farm she would be sorely
tempted to hurry back to the paddocks.
There is very little an energetic young Aus-
tralian girl cannot tackle successfully. This
one's mother treasures a snapshot of her
daughter, taken in dungarees, perched on top
of a traction-engine.
The Kenneth McWhae pair, after a short,
sharp experience of the beauties and baggage-
agents of Dai Nippon, are back again among
the homey sheep-smells of Burnbrae, the
lately-acquired family ranch at Penshurst.
George Iteid’s widow has taken Boldre-
wood (the Toorak hopie of late “Robbery
Under Arms” Browne), and has settled down
to housekeeping, aided and abetted by her
son and daughter-in-law.
George Meudell, his wife and sister-in-
law, Mrs. Charles Goodall, returned from
exile in U.S.A. by the Tofua. The ladies
report that clothing and female fripperies
are much more costly than in Sydney and
Melbourne, both which cities are nearly a
whole season ahead of San Francisco and
Los Angeles in fashions, particularly those
created in Paris. The Californian women
dress expensively but with good taste, and
pay much attention to facial and figure
betterment.
The Tom Hogans cut out the exhausting
race-festival season, and are surfing at
Lome.
Reggie G. Jen-
nings, a young
Australian p 1 a y-
wrig ht, lias just
bad his latest effort
given a trial produc-
tion in Geelong to an
audience of Western
District people. A
new play called
“Snappy” is to be
published very soon,
and some of bis
yarns have been
dramatised. Jennings
has published two
books—“ Yarns” and
“Told in a Dormi-
tory.” The young
man, a brother of
S.A. cricketer Jen-
nings is known to half of Melbourne and
all the Western District as the popular
master of the Junior C. of E. Grammar
School at Corio. The photo is from Talma’s.
Hostesses are being worried by klepto-
maniacs this season. At a recent big pri-
vate dance a popular mummer lost his best
London-cut overcoat—a sapphire-blue sponge-
cloth garment. The disconsolate fellow made
his exit in the chill hours camouflaged in a
well-tried service khaki coat.
Tassy is having a visit from Miss Craig
-Robert on, a delegate from the National
Council of Women of Great Britain. The
young visitor is very pretty. She comes frae
Glasgow', lectures on child welfare, and is
a keen worker for the Y.W.C.A. From the
Speck she goes on to Maoriland and then
to Canada. The Nicholls lady, wife of the
Judge, has been engineering her lectures and
meetings in the absence of president Mrs.
Hobson. Hobart is interested in a plain
gold band Miss Roberton wears on the wed-
ding-ring finger. The band is only the thick-
ness of a fine wife, and is almost hidden
by heavily-jewelled rings.
Adelaide’s diversions:—
Mrs. G. H. Dean has just got her youngest son
back from the war, via India, where he has been
on border work for the last year or so. His mar-
riage to Jean Duncan is to occur early in 1920; the
newly-weds will leave at once for India, where he
will rejoin his regiment.
Henley-on-Torrens, originally booked’for December
6, has been postponed till February. Our drought-
afflicted river is so full of weed it is almost impos-
sible for the water-duck to paddle about. A
regatta wouldn’t be able to move.
Jean Wigg, only daughter of Dr. and Mrs. 11.
Higham Wigg, of North Adelaide, is engaged to
Ernest, only son of Frank Barritt, of Yatalunga.
Said that the brasshats are to be shifted round
again. Brig.-Gen. Brand will probably be trans-
ferred here from Victoria as commandant, the Vic-
torian command going to Brig.-Gen. Forsyth. Brig.-
Gen. Antill may have the job in Westralia.
Daisy Kennedy’s concerts have been the thrill
of the week, and have packed the Town Hall. Tall,
slim and graceful, with a mass of che3tnut hair, the
violinist has a good eye for color, and her distinc-
tive dressing is a delight. Also she has the blessed
faculty of remaining unspoilt by success, and her
old friends find her just the same as when she left
here 11 years ago.
Tennis-champion R. V. Thomas, just home, talks
like an oyster concerning his performance at Wimble-
don.
His Ex. returned from Melbourne on Saturday and
was at the Repertory Theatre’s performance of
“Prunella” in the evening.
lhe Kidmans write cheerfully from America,
where they are enjoying the Rockies. The cattle-
king found time to go up the Frazer River and
inspect Swiit s works.
, Adelaide Town Hall got a poor ad. over Hughes’s
visit, being unable to hold half the people who
wanted to hear him. The Exhibition, which takes
3100, has not got rid of its ’flu patients, and the
Town Hall holds only half as many. It was built
in 1860, and is now out of date. The Corpora-
tion owns a whole acre, but much of it is a
pub, and the only improvement possible without
going to heavy expense is to throw into the main
hall a large room now behind the organ.
Two S. Australian fliers are going to try to wing
their way home; Mrs. Andrew Smith, of, Walkerville,
has received a cable from her sons, Captain Ross
and Lieut. Keith, stating that they, vvill attempt
the flight in a Vickers-Vimy 'plane!; Ross has
already flown from England to India. .
Certain good people have been protesting lately
about the cuddlesome attitude of the dancers in
some of the modern steps. On the principle that
what the eye doesn’t see the tongue doesn t make
a fuss about, the latest is to have at least three
dances carried out in the dark.
Two vice-regal households have already
booked up for Walter Kirby’s song recital,
which is due on Wednesday, November 26.
Kirby has. been dieting strictly during the
last few months, and has lost at least three
chins in the process.
This week Melbourne gets a promising
baritone back from the war. George Cow-
ley, who served four years with the A.I.F.
as a private, is the returning songster. He
gave a recital when he was in London and
lifted up his voice at a few At Homes.
Daisy Kennedy, the young Adelaide
violinist who is arranging to fiddle with the
Verbrugghen Orchestra, is calculated to
make men find a new beauty in music. With
uncommon dark eyes and rare coppery hair,
she is substantial confirmation of an old
superstition that beauty is sometimes
troubled with brains. But it is interesting
to note that with all her music she has
found time to get married and start a family.
Her husband is a prominent Russian pianist
called Moiszewitszch, or something like that,
but she doesn’t pronounce his name in com-
pany for fear of being offered a cure for
catarrh. Daisy’s home is near High
Wycombe in England, where a dazzling in-
fant threatens to repeat her mother’s good
looks.
Little Fritz Hart, director of the Albert-
street Conservatorium and musical critic of
the Age, is to leave next month on a visit
to England, where he will try to publish
some of his songs. He also intends to look
in at Paris, Brussels and Dublin, where he
will visit “AE” (George Russell), the Irish
poet, some of whose verses Fritz has set
to music.
The Red Cross has acquired Aberfoyle at
Healesville as a rest home for damaged Dig-
gers. On Tuesday of last week the residence
was officially blessed and promised a useful
future by Lady Helen and a row of social
headlights. It should serve the purpose
handsomely.
“Tails Up” at the Tivoli is a fine clothes
revue. Australian Gwen Burroughs is de-
signei’-in-chief. There are several color-
scheme ballets, including a butteidiy revel.
Then, the oranges and lemons prance, and
it is plain to everyone why fruit is so dear.
The no-stocking craze has an outing. It
is quite effective when Minnie Love wears
black satin pantalettes and sandals. The
newest pantalettes (an effort was made to
bring them in in 1914) are close-fitting gar-
ments that follow the line of the leg to the
ankle. This leaves only the instep un-
covered. Minnie has some amazing clothes.
They are layers, or atmospheres, of gauze
with silver, gold or black laces.
Elsie Davies-Navaretti is making a modest
venture as an entrepreneuse next Wednesday
evening, when she is to give a “concert of
song” at the New Assembly Hall. No fiddler
or psalterer will take part. Guido Caeialli
is to be the soprano’s chief support.
Fred Esmelton, the popular producer of
“Lightnin’,” gave a merry farewell party at
The Grand on Thursday last. It was a
large show, and half the lounge was roped
off. The Aipericanised Australian host
brewed special cocktails in a secluded cor-
ner while maids handed out tea, ices and
bouquets. There was some excellent music,
with tenor Kirby in the lead. Diana Wilson
looked large and lovely in a black suit with
aldermanic lace ruffles. Gwen Burroughs
glowed in many colors. Tien Hogue sang,
and dancer Gee and his lady were in evi
dence; also the very blonde Steff Macdonald.
The Hennessys, Weedons and Westleys gave
weight to the assembly. Mrs. Horatio Webb
(a sister of Mr. Esmelton) helped to look
after the guests. Dr. Nihill was happy in
his bachelor way among so many women
Miss Fenner, Mrs. Alcock and Mrs. Speaker
Mackey were in the crush.
A line from the North:—
Mrs. W. Young, the senior woman journalist of
Brisbane, who has been on the Courier staff for
13 years, has resigned to accept an appointment
under the Education Department. She’s to be
Supervisor of Domestic Science at the Central Tech-
nical College, Brisbane. The presswomen of Bris-
bane gave a tea in her honor the other Saturday.
Having supplied Thomas Joseph Ryan
with a bed of roses at West Sydney, Labor
has chivalrously arranged for its only woman
candidate in Victoria to contest the most
hopeless seat in the State. Mary Grant,
who has the party nomination for Ivooyong,
where Robert Best is firmly established, is
a nurse who joined the party at the time of
the first conscription referendum. A slight,
fair-haired girl, she woi-ked like a demon,
proved an effective platform speaker, and
was twice fined for participating in “anti”
disturbances. It was at Kooyong, you re-
member, that the more experienced Vida
Goldstein failed ingloriously.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
The Women Painters’ show received offi-
cial benediction from Minister James, who
paid many tributes to the work on the walls
and whispered about the probable appoint-
ment of a woman to a seat among the Art
Gallery Trustees. The grey rooms were
choked with humans until the almost-
fragrant wild flowers by Hetty Dymock
seemed to wilt within their frame. Only
the front-rowers saw the pictures; the
further-backs contented themselves with tiny
glimpses and floods of chatter. Artistic
and musical Sydney was all there. Art in
Australia did a quiet mooch-around with
Bertram Stevens. Publisher George Rob-
ertson brought his wife and an appraising
Scotch eye; D’Arcy Irvine flung clerical
benevolence all around, soothing the
Vesuvius-like atmosphere created by Dattilo
Rubbo’s red tie; Mrs. Sherwood wore a
white frock and shaded her eyes with a wide
white hat, and Betty Solomon tried to look
detached when people discussed modelling;
Mrs. Mergentheim was froeked in primrose
shades, and Mrs. Holman was all navy and
white. Peg o’ my Heart Allgood, who is now
Old Lady 31, came in a dress of Irish linen,
and threw the fact in the teeth of Sydney as
proudly as though it embodied the solution of
the whole Irish question. Sara bought a bit
of Sirius Cove and some spring flowers to
take back to Ireland with her. Marion
Jones and her dad were shyly unobtrusive
in the crowd; the Hedley Parsons “Blos-
som” quickly acquired a red seal; and every-
body chattered about the San Francisco
exhibit. Its name, “The Peri,” excited
comment, and the Rosa Dartles. who wanted
to know had always somebody close at hand
to tell them a quite-different version of the
legend.
Have you ever swung open the door of
the Seamen’s Institute on an ordinary night
and looked down the long, linoleumed room
with its stage and its billiard tables, its
piano and its numerous small tables around
which men—all hatted—play draughts or
dominoes or languidly turn over the pages
of the Queen or the Field or some like
paper? On one night when the door opened it
was to a wavering thread of melody that
reached a certain bar, broke, fumbled again,
and then swept into something the player
knew—a tall, rather-slight youth this boy
at the piano, with artistic fingers and a
clever head. An eight-year-old seaman lie
is, who left the London docks when he was
13 for his first voyage to the Indies. Lots
of boys in the room to-night who look no
more than that; one, a fair, rosy-cheeked
lad in uniform who is articled or appren-
ticed to a barque lying off Miller’s Point, a
well-spoken, clean-eyed boy who tells of
Devon. Little nuggetty men, not Aus-
tralians these, many of them from Liverpool;
and here and there a man who had plainly
bought his clothes with an order on the
ship’s tailor.
The ship’s tailor flourishes in every port
and shears his golden fleece from the deep-
sea A.B. He is powerless for evil against
the monthly-paid man in Australian waters.
But with the deep-sea man it is different.
When his ship touches port and the crew
asks the captain for part of its pay, he may,
quite within the law, and if he’s that sort,
decline to hand over the cash, but give the
men orders on the ship’s tailor. The ship’s
tailor, if he's that sort, trades the order—
so much in clothes (of a kind) and so much
cash, making a charge on the transaction
which (they whisper this libel) is divided
between him and the skipper. The man in
the ship’s tailor’s clothes wears a hat that
was sold for black felt, and a blue tie of the
shade that mothers use to be-ribbon their
very young babies. He is glancing through
a London paper, at the moment open at a
full-length picture of Lady Diana Manners.
Under the middle light a man with grey
eyes and a Norwegian smack to his tongue,
though he says he was born in the High-
lands of Scotland, tells how he spent two
and a half months in the Sea Adler. And
how his cantain and another got away one
day when the raider was being cleaned up.
It was the Norse-Scotsman’s part to invite
a guard grown slack to have a drink- and
a drink was not a hard thing to get if vou
pleaded “sick,” for the ship was well stocked.
His captain got to Suva and gave news of
the raider’s whereabouts, and that was some-
thing of justice, for the captain had seen his
ship with its cargo of copra disappear in a
pillar of smoke and flame. Some Japs drift
in and make for the gymnasium; and the
boy at the piano has captured the air that
had eluded him. With something of triumph
his fingers lightly and securely moor it to
his brain. It isn’t much of a tune, a shaving
from one of the musical comedies, but pres-
ently he has varied it, he has minordreyed
it and semi-toned it, till now it holds all "the
melancholy of lone spaces. “In 1904 I was
in a typhoon in the China Sea.” A man with
an almost Tartar height of cheekbone' is rum-
bling to a sharp-faced nipper in a grey cap.
“Cargo of timber on deck—that’s what saved
our lives. I seen the water rise like a pillar
of glass ’tween decks, and I says to the
skipper, ‘This is the end.’ but we drifted
along on the piles of timber, living on the
tinned food that was washed out of the
galley—pork and beans it was that bit
every time.”
Chaplain Leplastrier and Miss Doake nod
to old friends, some of 16 years’ standing
in the Mission. A man with a bandaged hand
comes along, and he tells his story. Matter
with his hand? Poisoned by one of the bear-
ings in a German vessel. The fittings had
been doctored with flesh-eating acids till
not a man of those who took her over but
had poisoned hands or feet. He asks for
magazines, but only one or two can be
spared, for papers and magazines are rare
gifts to the Institute. And so the night
wears on till it is time for lights-out and
the men to go back to their ships.
Australian girls who have married titled
or wealthy Englishmen have mostly had
bad luck. Apparently they get the wrong
sort, as American heiresses were mostly said
to do in King Edward’s day. Lady Conyng-
ham—who was Bessie Tobin, of Melbourne
- had hardly got her decree for desertion
when the Marquis was cited as co-re. in
another suit. Lord Carbery, the flying-man
spouse of the lady who was Josie Metcalfe,
of Queensland, would seem to have scoured
Europe in quest of illicit amusement —that
is, if her legal advisers aren’t in error. Wit-
nesses named in the suit hail from France,
Switzerland, Spain, England and Scotland.
Mrs. Sherwood Kelly, like the others, is
extremely well off. She is a sister of
“Pinky” Greene, the very smart-looking
young Etonian and Union Club man, who
went to England to enlist early in the war.
He got a commission in the Life Guards,
like George Vivers,' young Mackellar (son
of the doctor, who has just bought a house
at Wahroonga) and other affluent people.
One of the very unluckiest matrimonial
chances ever taken was that of a Sydney girl
who married a good-looking and enormously
rich young German. They had hardly reached
his home when he went raving mad.
This picture of Sydney-girl Lorna Ambler,
who is making good as Bobette in the
Belasco production of “Daddies,” recalls
some old Sydney history, for her grandad,
Fred Hiscocks, was
the first lessee of the
Tivoli, in those days
called the Garrick,
and still further back
the Academy o f
Music. It was he
who managed the
well-known Federal
Minstrels, and as far
back as 1880 he took
an Australian com-
pany to London.
The Oldest Inhabi-
tant still remembers
the flutter that was
caused when His-
cocks opened at the
Garrick with Olga
Nether sole and
Charles Cartwright
in “Moths’-’ and “The Village Priest.” With
all this professional inheritance not much
wonder that Lorna got an early chance to
show what she could do in America! In
the company ars two other clever Aussies:
little Lorna Volaire, of whom one U.S. paper
says she is the cleverest child actress seen on
the stage since Mary Miles Minter played
in “The Little Rebel” ; and Winifred Fraser,
who was associated with the Australian
tours of our old friends the Broughs.
In the fitness of things Florence Rodway
has been briefed to picture J. F. Archibald
for the National Gallery. It was Archibald
who “discovered” the Tasmanian girl and
introduced her pastels to Australia in glow-
ing adjectives.
Feeling extra puissant, perhaps because
of the sweet things Holman had been say-
ing of him, his Ex. remarked last week:
“We could put Europe into Australia.” He’d
burst it if he tried. An extra three-quarters
of a million square miles aren’t so easily
crumpled up even if you are a Governor!
Lady Davidson will spend Saturday with
Miss Eadith Walker at Yaralla, and then
pack up for Moss Vale.
Commander J. L. W. Allison, R.N., the
new A.D.C. at Government House, has only
just arrived from England, and is sampling
Australia for the first time. His wife is in
the Cold Country, and as yet there’s no
prospect of her coming to Sydney. The
genial salt, who looks quite young, retired
from the Navy in 1911. He’s a son of Mr.
W. Allison, special commissioner of London
Spoktsman and manager of the Inter-
national Horse Exchange.
The pre-recess festivities at Duntroon
this year have included several dances, as
well as the usual sports and ball. A num-
ber of Sydney girls, including Norah Wright,
second daughter of the Archbishop, are hav-
ing the time of their lives.
Monty Grover, editor of the Sunday Sun,
leaves for London next month to help Keith
Murdoch run the Sun cable service. He is
going to see how he likes it for a year.
This is Mrs. Tom
Ryan, wife of Aus-
tralia’s ambitious
politician. M r s.
Ryan is good-looking
and has a way with
her, besides which
she believes in her
husband’s star. Some
time ago a woman
friend remarked that
Tom might be handed
a Justiceship or given
some other safe
mooring in the politi-
cal backwash. Mrs.
Ryan opened her
eyes in horror. “No,
no,” she exclaimed.
“I don’t want Tom
to retire from the
fight yet. He’s much too young.”
Crowds of people climbed the long hill
that leads to the King Salter home at
Cockatoo last Saturday afternoon; for a
fete to add a few bricks to the girls’ hostel
was under weigh. The intention had been
to hold the fete on the lawns at the top of
the hill, but the weather was uncertain, so
the stalls were arranged under cover of the
verandahs. Dame Margaret Davidson was
the spirit of the afternoon, dressing the am-
bassadress-of-Empire act with considerable
charm. The good little Daphne and Diana,
as shy as the pansies they were selling,
scooped in many a shilling for the lime and
mortar. Veteran Mrs. Stephen quickly sold
out of all the work her wonderful hands turn
out with increasing cunning as the years
pass. Besides the fancy-work stalls and the
stalls where you could buy home-make cakes
and preserves, there was a houp-la and a
movie show ; but the best fun of all was the
scent-smelling competition. One man picked
up a bottle and held it delicately to his nos-
trils. “Ah,” he said, “I know that scent.
Strange, but it seems associated with every
memory of my life.” Another deep sniff.
Romantic, yet virile,” he muttered. At this
his better-half seized the bottle. A passing
whiff was enough. “That,” said she, leading
her mere male firmly and pityingly away—
“that is onion extract.”
Green lawns, recreation fields, vegetable
garden and orchard stretch around the
Christian Brothers’ Training College at
Strathfield, for which the Jubilee Celebra-
tions gathered in something like £20,000.
The building itself is cool and pleasant, with
many an old shady tree still about it, for
the principal wing was in other days the
George Reid home, and later James
Edmond’s. There is a sewing-room, too,
where the soutanes are made; for the
tailored soutane has soared out of reach of
one dedicated to poverty. Across the grounds
is another house which is to be kept as a
sanatorium for sick brothers, and here a
trained nurse will be in residence. Brother
Moore was very busy on Saturday helping
parties of visitors to explore the college, for
the whole place was thrown open to the
friends who had helped in the series of
bazaars and f@tes that piled up the required
thousands and made the Jubilee truly golden.
By the way, the forceful Father Coffey, ad-
ministrator of Dunedin, won a Beale piano
in the big art union. One wonders what
poor little musician the gift will finally
reach ; for Father Coffey has an irresistible
desire to give away things, and is the despair
of every housekeeper who takes the Palace
under her wing.
Representatives of two old Australian*
families foregathered recently at National
Park, when chieftain Ted Small called a
muster of his clansmen to welcome back from
war his three sons, Hubert, Allan and Bill.
The chief himself belongs to that long line,
the Smalls of Ryde, whose progenitor was
the first “free” white girl born on this con-
tinent. His wife is the great-great-grand-
daughter of the Rev. Robert Cartwright,
first C. of E. minister at Sydney, who
figures in J. H. M. Abbott’s stories of Old
Windsor, and after whom Cartwright Square,
Goulburn, was named.
Mabel Holmes, who arranges many of the
Tivoli’s cleverest ballets, became for private
reference Mrs. Norman W. Cardwell last
week, linking up with her returned suit of
khaki almost as soon as its Teddy Bear boot
touched Melbourne soil. Bridegroom is
treasurer of the Tivoli.
Maude Phillips, from “up the river,” has
won the approval of her own side of the
family and the in-laws-to-be by promising to
bring the girl-and-boy romance between her
and ex.-A.1.F.-er Shelley (he’s nephew, bv
the way, to the widow Norman Shelley) to
the happy-ever-after ending.
On a warm, moist night last week Wah-
roonga Scotchbyterian Church blessed the
partnership of war-worker Mary Murdoch
an^T-^ leut ‘ ? eoffre -y Alan Johnson, who pins
a Military Medal on his khaki. Mary who
is the youngest blossom in the Murdoch gar-
den, had a wedding dress that was built of
satin, Limerick lace, silver tissue, chiffon
and pearl embroideries, and wore dad’s gift
a pearl necklace. There were four brides-
maids whose vari-eolored georgette frocks
put out the sign that cheered Noah after the
flood. In addition, they wore what ap-
peared to be haloes of black tulle. The
Murdoch home, Midhope, had all lights on
tor the party, the 150 guests being refreshed
in a marquee in the vicinity of the Dutch
rose-garden. Bride’s mother wore silver
tissue and silver lace. Dad is Colonel Mur-
doch, who has much war-auxiliary service
to hi? credit.
It was during last week’s wet weather that
Llsie lerdriau (you probably wear one of
their rubber coats yourself) married Cre-
morne boy Lex Buckle, and his mother is
president of the Cremorne Red Cross, where
uie bride had Y.A.’d with enthusiasm. Scots’
Church saw the wedding, the bride’s “I
will” being murmured from the softness of
a lace veil brought from Brussels. Three
bridesmaids had rainoow effects of lilac
faintest yellow and pink taffetas. Bride’s
mother and father shook hands with the
guests at the Wentworth. Mrs. Perdriau
wearing black georgette in company with
mauve flowers.
Handsome Ina Cornish is back again from
London. During most of the war she worked
at the Australian Officers’ Club in Picca-
dilly Mrs. Leonard Dangar and Mrs. Tony.
Hordern were among her fellow-toilers.
It was a well-filled Town Hall that went
to cheer Lilian Gibson’s rich contralto last
week. Lilian was in good voice and a blue
dress that had a large red flower clutching
the draped skirt. After the opening number
she might have been a carnival queen, such
a garden of blooms was showered upon her.
Lilian Frost showed the organ she knew ali
about it, and Cappelli sang “Lolita”; and
there were others, including fiddler Mowat
Carter and a tornado of elocution named
Harry Thomas.
Contralto Eileen Shettle betrayed the
possession of some ’cello-like and well-trained
notes at the afternoon arranged in her honor
by Mrs. Ada Baker, her former teacher.
Eileen, in white georgette and a picturesque
black hat, was as inviting at close range as
she was when she bossed the smart, grey-
Cl i K L^ rmy of show-room girls in the last act
of ivatmka,” or when she was one of the
alluring models in “Oh, oli, Delphine.”
Eileen says she’s tired of waiting for a hor-
rible accident to befall the lead so’s she
may step into the part; she wants to air
her notes in front, where the applause comes
tiom. Lately she has joined the swelling
choir that sings before the films.
The assembly-room at Stanway House was
crowded with earnest women, most of them,
in spite of the lack of help at the washing-up
sink, dressed with considerable sleekness,
when earnest Mrs. Simm, tall Miss Chorn-
iy’ and rosy-cheeked Miss Pughe-Jones put
their cards on the table for the inspection
ol the V ictoria Leaguers and the National
Council of Women; but when Mrs. Simm
said she could promise Australia hundreds
ot gills for every walk in life, somebody
threw m a wet rag with the remark that
the newcomer mustn’t be allowed to work
at a lower rate than the girl on the spot.
However, Mrs. Simm insists that our indus-
tnes are starving for the girl from the little
Welsh hills and the English meadows, not
to mention the lochs of Scotland and the
shores of Killarney (I’m not very sure
that the shores of Killarney got a mention) ;
so the \\ aacs and the Wrens, the tomtits
and the larks, are to fly southwards to build
their nests. Miss Brace put down a very
well-shaped foot on the idea that some
penny packets of seed and 20 pounds in
the near-silk safe-deposit are sufficient capi-
tal for farming in Australia. Ruth Beale
in vibiant tones and handsome but very bare
aims—and not a National Councillor flickered
an eyelash at the sight—spoke of the wel-
come Australia held for women who had
i e ® m Pi re ’ s home-fires burning. Miss
\V indeyer brought a sleek head and pink
„ unc ? s the discussion; Lady Davidson
ottered a measure of sweetness to all; the
Cullen lady, Mrs. Anderson, Dr. Boelke and
Mrs. Dwyer helped the discussion along. And
one came away wondering really how much
for arder we’d got.


THE BEALE
COMBINED in the Beale Player-Piano are the true
attributes of perfect playing, viz, faultless technique and
superb interpretive control. The instrument’s technical
perfection we will not unduly stress. It is perfect, but we take
it that mere brilliancy of execution is as soulless a thing in a
self-playing Piano as in a ten-fingered human player. Even
Schumann deemed technical adroitness valuable only when it
served a higher purpose.
And that higher purpose? It is undoubtedly to reach and
express the soul of music. This is what the Beale Player-Piano
does. Not because of its stupendous technical ability, but be-
cause the nine expression controls enable one to reveal the
inner beauty of every musical composition. The controls are
the reason for 'Beale’ superiority.
There are also superior features of construction which can be
made intelligible only by an inspection. These we shall be
pleased to explain any time.

avoided by the
beginner. It ex-

moderate price, its comfortable lines and its wear*
ing properties.
We make the tree in this saddle ourselves—it is
well plated along the bars, has good strong gullet
p'ate and steel stirrup bars. The knee-pads are
well made and hand sewn, the panel is the favorite
short style with broad leather sweat-flaps at side
and extended leather facings at back. The fittings
are as illustrated, folded girth, leathers and polished
two-bar stirrups.

When father got the hand-painted slippers
what he said was —
not intended for the ears of the well
meaning donor.
Father has been hoping that someone
would have the “ gumption” to send him
an Onoto pen, so as to make easier the
task of putting into diplomatic language
his letters- of “ thanks” to those who
“ remembered” him at Christmas.
Have you ten friends or relatives for
whom you want to select a worthy gift
—a delightful gift - yet a gift of lifelong
usefulness ?
Get ten Onotos !
To fill an Onoto one simply withdraws
the “head,” dips the nib into the ink,
presses back the “ head,” and the Onoto
is filled. No need of a filler. And no
fear of leaksge after the Onoto is filled.
A simple turn of the “head” renders
the Onoto a sealed tube. Even if carried
up side down in the pocket, an Onoto will
never leak a drop.
That’s why Father said :
WHY DIDN’T THEY SEND ME
AN
Onoto
The self-filling safety fountain pen
The Onoto is All British Made by a British Company, with Pritish Capital and
Labour. It is designed to last a lifetime, and is guaranteed by its makers.
Price 17/-, and in a variety of more elaborate styles for presentation purposes, in
handsome cases, of all Stationers, Jewellers and Stores. Booklet about the Onoto pen
free on application to THOMAS DE LA RUE & 00., LTD., 322 Bunhill Row, London,
E.O. ; or the Managing Agents for Australasia, NORMAN BAKER & LONGHURST,
50 York Street, Sydney.

ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
A'o notice (except of a hostile character ) will be
taken of communications insufficiently stamped.
Name and address must appear on the MSS. A'o
liability is undertaken re contributions volun-
tarily submitted; and no MS. will be returned
unless stamps accompany.
A.J.8.: Suppose you and the Twelve
Apostles were wrecked on an island. Presently you
all got to work and decided that, for convenience
of exchange, certain shells should be used as
money. These shells being rare, three bought a
fish. Then suppose a storm occurred and the sea
washed up a large quantity of the same shells.
Promptly Peter would demand half a dozen of them
for the same-sized fish. The note-printing press is
the storm so far as we are concerned... .Army N.:
Of course, more Diggers unduly rush their discharge
than swing the lead and remain in hospital. In
fact, scores of men within this paper’s knowledge
have pressed for discharge because they didn’t want
to be thought lead-swingers:... R. 0.8.: What s the
title of the contribution you ask us to chase ?. ...
Frank B.: Rates run from threepence a line up... .
Piffle: You’re right—it is- J.E.P.: Thanks, but
doubt if it could be used that way.... Mac: Write to
N.S.W. Agricultural Department.... J.W.R.: (1) That
pen-name belongs to somebody else; (2) the verses
totter like a “National” Government E.S.M.H.:
There was never anything in that jape... .Tinno:
Anything that you or anybody else writes that is
worth a place will- be printed.... Eccles: Yes, they
can be purchased. Write to the manager.... Bill
MacHenare: (1) Thanks; (2) address it N. S. Wales
Forestry Department, Sydney ; (3) question you ask us
will be more quickly answered by the Department.. . .
Latest Reactionary: Answered before. Some of the
verse is very lumpy and forced. .. .E.G. (Brisbane):
The yarn is too bald... .H.W.&.: “Roofs” won’t do.
M.11.L.: There ought to be a market for it else-
where. .. .8.W.: Dog yarn far too wordy and long.
. ...A.B. (Epping) : Same subject better treated be-
fore. .. .F.J.E.N.: There’s something- you know better
than anybody else. Write about that, whatever it
is E.G.C.: Verse runs a bit wild in places; but
a rhyme like “grander,” “verandah” —Out!. .. .
A.J.M.: “Dust” can’t rhyme with “crushed” nor
“sport” with “nought,” which is a pity, as the
point is well made Merrie Mickie: “Reminiscence”
wants more life. . . .L.F. (Cairns) : If you want things
returned send stamps with the MS. Paragraphs can’t
be returned Y. 1.: Printed as a sample of what
we don't want: —-
Last June,
And now October;
Sixteen months of waiting.
The day you went iny. eyes stretched forward.
Now you are here they strain forward again,
For hot yet are you mine.
Ah, Life! last long enough
To bring- you to me.
. ...E.11.M.: Not up; but we’ve known lots of first
attempts that had more bumps in them....E.H.
(W.A.) : You only say rather poorly what many have
said before.... Barney: Very thin stuff. ... A.R.Y.:
Not in sight of port P.F.8.: “Spring Song”
hardly does it; “Invitation” held for inquest....
J.A.W.: You’re a heavyweight humorist. .. .H.E.
(Melbourne): “Drusilla” doesn’t hit our fancy....
N.B. (Wagga): You have the eye to see;
now get the skill to make others see....
S.E.: Solemn inanity.... Spanish Bridle: Don’t
know what it’s about. .. .Marjorie G.: Even
verse-writing calls for something in the- way of
effort. Easy writing is nearly always hard reading.
. ...8.A.C.: First trouble about the “sonnets” is
that they are not; second, they don’t matter if they
were... .T.L.A.: No story there....H. M. Cold-
streamer: Thanks for good opinion. And in order
to continue to deserve it we’ll reject your verse.
....Westerner: What it's all about? Test-tube:
Stiff and uninteresting, with no poetic value....
V.F.K.: No, the “Song” doesn't go. No use for
> chopped prose here. Write good verse about some-
thing. You can do it G.G.Z.: Stupid stuff....
G. : Belated scrap and nothing fresh in it....
Brian Bom: Done to death Ephjaph: Not well
enough done. . . .V.H.C.: Machine-made yarns....
H. (Auckland): No; please don’t. .. .R.T.S.: No
vse....T.W. (M.L.) : Poor stuff, badly written....
L.F.W.: Nothing there. .. .H.G.H.: Too rugged....
Jesmond D.: Hasn’t the necessary quality.... lan
D.: There may be “Music in his soul,” but you
haven’t found even a respectable discord. .. .A.P.H.:
Dull, conventional verse, with no lift. .. .E.E.M.:
They don't thrill u5....0.8.: The “Dear Old
Pioneer” has it: —•
One never knows how soon one will go,
Our loved ones dear to mourn;
To follow one that ne’er had a foe,
That his memory be fresh, as fresh as morn.
Oh! how we’ll miss this Dear Old Man,
The greatest of all, of all pioneers,
That struggled here for thirty years,
The best, the very best of his clan. •
Oh! may the flowers forever bloom
On his grave of nut-brown loam,
Resting quiet in his home,
Peace, peace in liis tomb.
. ...V.A.F.: It hasn’t the quality.... D.K.C.: In
telling a story it is always wise to let the l-eader
know what some of it is about.... Padjud: You
assume that the public knows all about it. It
doesn’t. Say briefly what the position is and why
it is wrong.... Peter the P.: All right; “Jake B.”
is informed that the tail-slide is common as lies;
but the technical description of it is too du11....
Fx : That’s part of the trouble —the U.S.A. didn’t
go dry “under compulsion of the popular vote.” As
a Federal matter it hasn’t been put to the popular
vote. And it’s a moot question whether it ever should
be. Surely there are some things that our wowser
(or any other) neighbor has no right to dictate to
us about.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
P.G.H.: Sorry, the artist can’t get it into a pic-
ture... .Ex-Digger: Two wooden soldiers —dismiss!
.. . .N.F.: That drunk was cut out with a blunt axe.
. .. .Fin: The joke emerges gradually like an injured
snake. Drawing p00r... .Artist-Editor: Is the
editor’s left arm growing out of his knee?... .1.R.:
Jest as old as milking' stools... .E.W.M.: Creaks
in every joint.... F.: Tooth-extraction quip is the
sort of thing that starts rows in pubs... .C.L.A.:
More depressing than a humid day.... Annie G.:
The flapper doesn't know what to do with her arms.
. ...L.S.: One thing is obvious —you can’t draw
fowls Cam II.: If you have any humor try to
get some of it into your drawings.... R.F.D.: Drown
the kid.... Perce C.: English types. Improve or
stop W. 8.: Learn a lot more about art and try
to keep some of the paper unscratched C.A.A.:
Very early stuff. Work on.

BESIDE these blue enthralling seas
That surge unceasingly,
From distant spaces, on the breeze,
At times there comes to me
The grief of green things robbed of life —■
Grass-blade and fern and tree.
’Tis said the Desert drones its prayers
In old Arabian lands,
That when the sun no longer fares
Across the sky, but stands,
A guest, back-looking from the west,
To Allah pray the sands.
And thus, though some hear not, and some
Care not to know and seek
Earth’s hidden tones, the seeming-dumb—
Plain, mountain, tree and creek—
Perchance, when all is still and mute,
Their sylvan secrets speak.
The Coast is like a damsel clad
As for a festival;
Her rivers sing, her hills are glad,
She has no woe at all;
On her the showers beloved of flowers,
Beloved of forests, fall.
The kind winds keep her fresh and sweet —
The sea-winds, blithe and free;
For when, bowed down by too much heat,
She craves their ministry,
They bear to her across blue leagues
The kisses of the Sea.
The Coast is like a damsel dressed
In bridal garments fair,
With water-jewels on her breast
And fragrance in her hair.
The Plains, the great grim Plains, are men,
Gaunt men, at grips with Death.
Bruised, naked, tortured, scourged, they
thrust
The death-grip from their throats,
While, dimmed by smoke and dulled by dust.
A red sun, wizened, gloats
Upon their pain, and. taunting them,
A mocking mirage floats.
Where Drought is lord, and Thirst is rife,
And Famine fouls the air,
Like men, gaunt men, they fight for life
lhrough blind and black despair,
With muscles wearied by the fray,
And bodies scarred and bare.
I arched tracks. and shrunken rivers tell
Df hope that dims and wanes;
Like horses from the yards of Hell,
Hot hoofed with burning manes'
And nostrils spouting fire, the winds
Make war upon the Plains.
Juke men. gaunt men, by Fate accursed,
They lift their cries to God ;
-they moan, black-tongued: “We thirst, we
thirst
In vein and rock and sod ;
11, is nt T^ >ar^ en .' SColll ‘£ ( 'd and scarred we lie
By Desolation trod!”
The Coast is like a damsel gay
In bridal finery,
W ho trips along a shining way,
As happy as can be;
Upon her cheeks, by noon and night.
Cool kisses of the Sea.
Around her footsteps beauties throng,
Dews gleam and sunlight glows,
Soft silences and sweetest song
Attend her as she goes,
And in her veins green life unchecked
A singing current flows.
°h, sweet were all our thoughts and hours,
And blithe were she. indeed,
lhis dazzling damsel Coast of ours,
r»e that our hearts take heed
mu ? th at work —the tortured Plains
-that gasp in direst need.

A Wireless Outfit.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.
AT the first streak of down the Mam-
bare had stood out from her berth at
the mouth of the Jacatra River,
and already the Batavia Roads had dropped
hazily into the distance. Only the chain of
the Brambanan Mountains, to the rear of
the town, showed shadowy and cool in the
pallid glare of the morning sun. Captain
Cordova strode to the rail and spat impres-
sively towards the receding coast of Java.
His mate, who owned to the name of Smith,
eyed him reflectively.
“To be perfectly frank,” said Mr. Smith
earnestly, “I don’t half like this job. I don’t,
really.”
Cordova wheeled on him. “Who the hell
asked you to like it?” he demanded.
“Nobody that I’m aware of,” said Mr.
Smith hastily. “I’m only telling you what
I think.”
“I don’t want to know what you think,”
said Captain Cordova. “If I care to run
into trouble I don’t see that it’s got any-
thing to do with you.”
“Maybe it has and maybe it hasn’t,” re-
plied the mate cautiously. “I’m not afraid
of trouble —nobody knows that better than
you—but I haven’t got any hankering for
limelight.”
“I can quite understand that,” said Cor-
dova dryly. “I suppose you didn’t leave
®y^ ne y iu a hurry for the fun of the thing?”
“That’s my affair,” snapped the mate. “As
for yourself, I suppose you never wondered
why we’re taking agricultural machinery out
to the Bismarcks?”
“Can’t say I have.”
ell, I have. And I happen to know a
bit more than most people about telegraphy,
wireless and otherwise, and that machinery
is the most complete wireless plant I’ve
ever seen.”
“That’s interesting,” said the other with
a contemplative eye on the mate.
It s more than interesting,” asserted Mr.
Smith. “It’s disturbing.”
“Admittedly—if you intend to worry over
it. I don’t. We’ve got to deliver the
cargo, not to worry over any fancy names
they give it.’’
“But” —began the mate.
“Forget it,” Cordova cut in, and turned
to the rail again. The discussion was at an
end. Mr. Smith looked at his chief, started
to say something, hesitated, and thought
better of it.
“This damned sun would fry an egg, it’s
that hot,” said Mr. Smith.
Captain Cordova wiped his streaming
brow with the sleeve of his coat and swore
softly to himself.
The Mambare lay at anchor in a small
bay in the north coast of New Britain, mid-
way between Dampier Strait and Cape
Itault. The place was uncharted and
apparently uninhabited; it was by merest
guess-work that Cordova had found his way
to the appointed spot. But, then, a South
Sea navigator who does not rely on instinct
rarely gets anywhere save to the bottom of
the sea. Most South Sea charts are un-
reliable; even the Admiralty ones in places
are polite fictions.
The weird bulk of the Uunstein Moun-
tains rose in the distance, tier on tier, like
the monstrous grandstand of some Gargan-
tuan racecourse. Blue they were, and they
faded imperceptibly into the deeper and
franker blue of the cloudless sky. Between
the mountains and the shore the green dusk
of the jungle sank all individual things into
invisibility. But deep in that matted, un-
canny tangle there were savages, who, them-
selves unseen, by day and night kept watch
on the strange vessel that lay at anchor in
the bay. Cordova and Smith would have
known nought of this silent, invisible espion-
age. but the Motuan boys, wise with the
wisdom of generations of head-hunting, man-
eating forebears, saw that which could not
be seen and were uneasy.
“I wonder how much longer those sons
of dogs are going to keep us waiting?” Cor-
dova said suddenly. “We’ve been here four
days now and nothing has happened.”
.“What would you expect to happen?”
Smith asked.
Cordova shrugged his shoulders. “I don't
expect anything to happen, Smith, but I’d
be more at ease if it did.”
And almost at that instant the unexpected
put in an appearance. Cordova had fancied
that they would be met by a steamer; at
the least it would be a schooner that would
take off their cargo, he presumed. But out
of the distance came the smooth, even “plop-
plop’.’ of a motor-engine.
Up against the faint blue of the hazy dis-
tance there showed a little black dot, a dot
that broadened and came on with an almost
incredible speed. Soon its lines were visible,
and the frothing trail of cliurned-up sea
showed white against the blue.
“Some boat that,” Mr. Smith opined.
“Some engine,” said Cordova.
For a time neither of them spoke. The
noise of the little engine increased ; the boat
itself grew in size. It slashed the water
with the precision of a sword. Now the
figures of men were visible, and soon the
watchers could discern what manner of men
they were.
Cordova looked at his mate and Mr.
Smith looked at his skipper. There was
that in then’ glair e v, hieh went beyond the
power of words to express.
“Uniforms,” said Mr. Smith laconically.
“German naval men,” Cordova added.
“Agricultural implements, which turn ouc
to be wireless apparatus destined for Ger-
man naval men,” Smith said reflectively.
“You’re right for once,” Cordova told him.
Smith ignored the remark ; he did not feel
inclined for hot words at that juncture.
Lieutenant Paul Flurm eyed Cordova in
a way that made the captain anxious to
wring someone’s neck.
“Captain Cordova,” he snapped, “schooner
Mambare ?”
His English was good; there was in it
just the faintest tinge of the guttural. Cor-
dova eyed him with disfavor.
“That’s my name,” he said shortly. “And
as for the schooner —her name’s written
plain enough.”
“You have a cargo for me,” the officer
asserted.
Cordova raised his eyebrows in affected
surprise.
“Have I?” he said pleasantly.
“Answer me!” he commanded. “You
come from Van Dronk?”
“I do,” Cordova admitted. “Anything else
you’d like to know?”
Lieutenant Paul Flurm rattled his sword.
He would dearly have loved to smite this
insolent trader to the deck, but somehow
did not deem it wise. He knew of Captain
Cordova—who in the South Seas did not? —
and he was well aware that he was a
dangerous man to deal with. Cordova might
have the frank countenance of a school-boy
and the wide blue eyes of a babe, but he
had a direct way that was famed from the
Louisades to the Galapagos, from the Mar-
shalls to Lord Howe.
“I shall be greatly obliged if you find it
convenient to deliver the cargo at the
earliest moment,” the officer said in a less
arrogant tone.
“That’s better,” said Cordova pleasantlv.
“Why didn’t you ask like that at first? It
would have saved a lot of trouble.”
The German shrugged his shoulders; there
was no sense in arguing with an intolerable
pig of a trader who knew not the meaning of
reason and had no respect for side-arms and
a naval swagger. But Flurm wanted the
cargo and wanted it badly, so he swallowed
his pride and soothed the frank-faced sea-
rover into a state of apparent amiability.
Then case after case was brought on deck
by the native boys, examined carefully by
the lieutenant himself, and transhipped to
the motor-launch.
With the landing of the first part of the
cargo certain mysterious activities took place
on shore. From a space cleared in the jungle
an attenuated mast of steel rose graduallv
into the sky, and filmy wires wove them-
selves about it.
(Continued on next pngs.)


STRONG!
In these trying days we need every ounce of strength and the
ability to do a full day s work every day. The man or woman with
weak kidneys is half crippled. A lame, stiff back, with its constant
dull ache and sharp, shooting twinges, makes the simplest task a
burden and a full day s work impossible. Headaches, dizzy spells,
urinary disorders and an all worn out” feeling are daily sources of
distress. You can t afford to neglect kidney weakness and make it
easy for gravel, dropsy or incurable kidney disease to take you. Get
a bottle of DOAN’S BACKACHE KIDNEY PILLS to-day. They have
helped many Sydney people. They should help you.
SYDNEY TESTIMONY.
A NORTH SYDNEY RESIDENT.
Mr. John Simmons, 7 Bank Street, North Sydney,
says:—“For some years I suffered dreadfully from
serious kidney trouble. The agony I had to bear was
at times awful, and can be better imagined than
described. I was under several doctors, but their
treatment did not benefit me very much, and I would
soon be as bad as ever again. A - friend of mine heard
of a wonderful cure by Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills,
so urged me to try these pills, and I decided to do so.
After taking one bottle I felt very much better, and
as I kept on with them the improvement was main-
tained until finally I was completely cured, and I
have not had a sign of kidney trouble since. Doan’s
Backache Ktlney Pills have my heany recommenda-
tion, and 1 hope many will benefit by my experience
and give them a trial.”
Three years later Mrs. Simmons says:—“My hus-
band has had no return of his old complaint since
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills cured him some time ago.”
A SURRY HILLS RESIDENT.
Mrs. H. Sturgeon, 70 Marlborough Street, Surry
Hills, Sydney, says:—“lt gives me great pleasure to
say a few words in praise of Doan’s Backache Kidney
Pills. For a good while I was a martyr to kidney
trouble, the symptoms being backache, urinary dis-
order and dizzy attacks. My back ached fearfully
and every movement was accompanied with a twinge
like the stab of a knife. The secretions were cloudy
and scalded a good deal in passing, this symptom
clearly showing my kidneys were very much out
of order. I heard good reports of Doan’s Backache
Kidney Pills, so decided to give them a trial. The
first bottle gave me relief and by the time I had
used three bottles I was cured, and I have been well
ever since, a period of over twelve months.”
Mrs. Sturgeon confirms the above four years later:
“My cure still holds good, no sign of kidney disorder
having returned since I took Doan’s Backache Kidney
Pills five years ago.”

The morning- of the third day saw the last
case delivered, and the German commenced
to dismantle the engine of the launch.
“You may go,” said Flurm magnanimously.
“I do not desire your further services. As
for payment-—Van Dronk, I understand, has
already paid you.”
“Quite correct,” said Cordova. “But as
for going—well, I want to ship some water.
We’re rather short of it.”
“I shall send some aboard by my men,”
Flurm informed him.
“Thanks,” said Cordova, as if it were to
him a matter of indifference.
Lieutenant Paul Flurm took his departure
in a native dugout, and later in the day his
men returned and replenished the water bar-
rels of the Mambare.
Now, if things had fallen out as Lieuten-
ant Flurm had planned, the Mambare would
have sailed out of the bay and into the in-
finite, leaving him to pursue his work in
peace. But the Fates that play havoc with
men’s lives were wide awake and hard at
work that summer afternoon. The breeze
that should have wafted the Mambare out of
the bay died away, and the schooner, not
being equipped with an auxiliary, had to
await a favoring wind.
Throughout the night blue lights flickered
and flared about the tangle of wires on shore,
and a “plop-plop” came faintly to the
schooner. Smith, who knew much about
such things, told Cordova that 'the dis-
mantled launch engine was supplying power
for the wireless station. Cordova offered
no comment, but relapsed into a silence preg-
nant with possibilities. He continued silent
and thoughtful all the next day, answering
his mate in monosyllables when he answered
him at all. Smith felt that something of a
dangerous and difficult nature was maturing
in Cordova’s brain, and wondered just what
it could be.
Evening came and the coppery sun
dropped into the western sea beyond Cape
Hampier. There was no dusk. One moment
the sky was streaked with wild crimson,
with delicate shades of salmon pink, and
the greenness of the tropic sea was touched
with the reflection of the sun; the next
moment darkness heavy and oppressive hid
all things. Only the yellow gleam of the
schooner’s binnacle lamp and an occasional
flash of blue flame from the wireless station
slit the night.
Cordova called Smith to him and for 20
minutes they talked earnestly. At the end
of that time they lowered the dinghy silently
and dropped into it.
As Cordova had predicted so things turned
out. No sentry had been posted on the sea-
ward side of the power-house; evidently no
attack was expected from any save the
men of the wood. Nevertheless Cordova
and Smith trod with extreme caution ; their
passage from the dinghy up to the wireless
house would have been to the credit of the
most daring head-hunter in all the Bis-
marcks. It is not often that a white man
achieves the supreme woodcraft gift of noise-
lessness ; the two sailors somehow came
within an ace of it. For a space they
crouched beneath the shadow of the shack
that did duty for the wireless house. Every-
thing was very still; even the steady tramp
of the sentry seemed to have died away.
Suddenly the launch’s engine explosively
broke the silence. Faintly to the ears of
the two sailors came the faint tick-tack of
the transmitter, and at the same instant the
w.res above their heads began to crackle.
“My God !” Smith ejaculated. “The—the
cows!”
“Can you read what they’re sending?”
Cordova questioned in a thick whisper.
“It’s like big print to me,” Smith an-
swered, and swung his head round to watch
the flicker of the wires.
“That’s Sydney’s code call!”
In the half-light of an island night Cor-
dova’s face showed ashen. He knew just
exactly what such a signal meant coming
out of the infinite on to the receiver of a
warship at sea. Both he and Smith
had been other things before they took to
trading. In the peaceful, every-day world a
thousand miles away he had answered to
another name than Cordova; and “Smith”
had been something more sonorous.
The door of the liut stood wide open
to the night, marked by a square of light
from the storm-lantern that lit the building.
Unhesitatingly Cordova walked through the
doorway. The operator’s back was turned
to him, but as Cordova’s shadow fell across
the machine the man twisted round to view
the disturber qf his work.
Cordova held his revolver lightly in his
right hand, but there was that in his eyes
that showed him to be in deadly earnest. He
advanced softly, with something panther-
like about his gait, right up to the table
on which rested the wireless instruments,
drew out the second chair and seated him-
self. Lieutenant Flurm watched him intently,
just the vaguest suggestion of the wonder
he felt creeping into his eyes. A cry from
him would bring half a dozen of his men to
his aid, would certainly alarm the supposedly
watchful sentry. But somehow Flurm could
not utter that cry ; he knew as surely as if
he iiad been told of it that it would be his
last word on earth. There was about Cor-
dova a certain magnetism that held him, an
easy confidence, a suggestion of a power that
knows its own sufficiency.
He ran his tongue over his lips.
“Well?” he said huskily.
Cordova pointed to the window cut in the
far wall of the building. It boasted no glass;
it was simply an air-vent. Flurm looked
wonderingly at the black square and in an
instant he saw. A dark figure, indefinite in
its outlines, lounged on the sill, but the
hands of the figure held a magazine rifle.
“You see,” said Cordova calmly, “resist-
ance is useless. I have not come unsup-
ported. Now, you and I are going to have
a quiet talk and if we are interrupted—
unnecessarily—there will be trouble. You
understand?”
Flurm nodded. But he did not understand.
There was something about this strange sea-
rover that troubled him vaguely, that awoke
memories of days gone by.
“What you mean by sending out Syd-
ney's call?” Cordova asked him.
The other shrugged his shoulders. “That
is my business,” he said.
“It doesn’t matter much,” Cordova smiled.
“But I’d father be told than have to find
out. I’m rather curious to know just what
message you were sending.”
The wide blue eyes gazed at him steadily.
Under the scrutiny Flurm grew uncomfort-
able ; his eyes wandered from the set face
in front of him and strayed to a pile of
papers on his right.
There came a quick step outside. Across
Flurm’s face flitted a momentary sign of
relief.
“One of your men,” said Cordova briskly.
“Tell him. to come in.”
Flurm barked a hoarse guttural sentence,
and the man answered him.
“I understand German,” Cordova re-
marked dryly.
Flurm threw out his hands in a gesture
of despair. At that moment there came the
sound of a scuffle, a faint gasping s'.gh and
silence.
“What was that?” he said.
Cordova was gazing towards the window ;
Flurm followed his glance. The rifleman
was no longer there. lie saw instead but
a square cut out of the blackness of the
tropic night. His head was turned only
an instant, but in that brief space of time
Cordova’s hand shot out, closed over a sheet
of paper and drew it swiftly towards him.
One glance showed him its purport.
“I’m afraid,” Cordova said slowly, “your
man will not come back. That explains
the absence of my friend. I’m afraid there
has been a ‘regrettable incident’.”
The German swore softly, glaring at Cor-
dova with eyes of hatred.
“It was a pity that I had to leave Heidel-
berg before I quite completed my studies,”
Cordova remarked suavely.
Slowly recognition dawned in the other’s
eyes. “You are not Captain Cordova,” he
said. “That has not always been your name.
You are”
The sailor restrained him with a gesture.
“That,” he said in the tone of a man who
deals with an unpleasant subject—“that is
a tale that must be given to the world in
some other way. Not through you, at any
rate. Still, I’m pleased you recognise me. It
makes my task easier. I can’t forget how
you befriended me—unfortunately. Other-
wise I would have killed you outright.”
_ The other said nothing, but there was in
his face a growing respect for his captor.
Cordova ran on in the same suave tone.
“I said that I was sorry I had not com-
pleted my studies,” he said. “I feared that
you had written your message in German,
but fortunately as you had to send it in
English you wrote it in English.”
Again the other’s eyes travelled slowly to
the pile of papers.
Cordova laughed softly. “A good plan,”
he appraised ; “an excellent plan if it had
succeeded. But it didn’t: it won’t. Now,
sit down quietly and tap off a message say-
ing that your call was a mistake. You are
at liberty to use Sydney’s call.
“I don’t understand you,” said Flurm
dully.
Cordova flourished the ■ paper in front of
his eyes. “Isn’t that an order to the South-
ern Squadron to proceed to Canna Bay at
once?” he asked,
Flurm nodded his head,
“I suppose you had the place mined or
something of the kind?”
“Mined,” said Flurm briefly,
“All right. Now you send this message:
‘All previous messages cancelled. Await
further orders.’ Are you going to do it?”
“There is nothing else for it,” said Lieu-
tenant Flurm bitterly.
He placed his fingers on the key, gave the
code-call, and ticked off the message. Mr.
Smith, the mate, heard the crackle of the
wireless, and read and checked the message,
“Now,” said Captain Cordova, “I’m re-
luctantly compelled to tie you up while I
retreat,”
_ * * „„ r * ... , ,
QMy one casualty, Mr. Smith remarked
as tbe y gained the open sea some half an
hour later. “I had to do it. It wouldn’t
have done to let him get away knowing what

„ Captain Cordova, in answer produced
fj'om hisi jacket pocket a twisted piece of
nietal which had once been portion of the
transmitter.
Mr. Smith smiled.
Cordova wheeled on him. W hat the hell

to do them with. This plain truth is amply verified in the dismantling

hauling. If you have the necessary spanners that will adapt them-
selves readily to every nut and get into every awkwaid corner, the
job can be pleasantly, satisfactorily and expeditiously done—if not

A Valve that Stays Tight—The “EVERLASTING” VALVE.
m\m i/mw blw\
WHEN responsible engineers after testing an article adopt it as standard for every service
for which it is suitable, specify it in their specifications, recommend it to other engineers
and have nothing but praise for it, the article must possess great intrinsic merit. That
is what has happened to the “Everlasting” Leak-proof Valve, and that is why this Valve is specified
by the Commonwealth for their new steamers, by the New South Wales Railways for all new
Locomotives, by such large users as The Broken Hill Proprietary, the Colonial Sugar Refining
Co., G. & C. Hoskins Ltd., by innumerable smaller concerns, and by shipping companies. For
a particular service one shipping company, after testing every other valve without getting one
to stand more than a few months, tried an “Everlasting”; after 12 months’ service it has
just been taken out for examination and found to be as sound and tight as the day it was put in.
The Everlasting Valve is not cheap to buy, but it is remarkably cheap to use, for
out; that is, speaking finitely.
It is made in all sizes and all kinds of metal of the best quality material, and by
the only truly self-grinding valve extant.
it never leaks and never wears
