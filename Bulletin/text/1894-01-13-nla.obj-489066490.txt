(published at SYDNEY, N.S.W.)
The Unique Weekly-Ausiralin's Nouparell
Illustruted Newsper.
“The Bulletin,”
Premier Australian Literary Journal,
Is the only paper which has a consistent and dis-
tinctive Australian National Policy.
The Bulletin favours—
A-Republican Form of Government.
One Person, one Vote.
Complete Secularisation and Freedom of State
Education.
Reform of the Criminal Code and Prison
System.
A United Australia and Protection against
the World.
Australia for the Australians.—The cheap
Chinaman, the cheap nigger, aim the
cheap European pauper to be absolutely
excluded.
A State Bank, the issue of bank-notes to be. a
State monopoly.
The direct election of Ministers by Parlia-
ment, instead of Party Government or
rather Government by Contradiction.
A new Parliamentary System one House to
be elected by constituencies as at present;
the other to be chosen by the whole
country voting as one Constituency.
A Universal System of Compulsory Life
Insurance.
The entire Abolition of the Private Owner-
ship of Land.
The Referendum.
The Abolition of Titles of so-called “ nobility. ’
The public eye rejects as uninteresting more
than half of what appears in the newspapers of
the day. It is only the remainder that is found
in The Bulletin.
The Bulletin is an aggressive Democratic
paper which strives to exclude from its artisti-
cally-condensed columns all matter that is not
of general human interest. The Bulletin was
started 13 years ago with no capital but brains,
and has become the representative Australian
journal, because it possesses a vitality lacked
by the countless newspaper-ventures in which
Australian capitalists have unavailingly spent
large fortunes.
The Bulletin’s conductors claim that every
progressive paper on the Australian continent has
more or less endeavoured to profit by its example
and follow its lines. The result of its powerful
influence and its unprecedented literary and com-
mercial success can at once be seen by com par. ng
the methods pursued by the Australian daily and
weekly press prior to and immediately after th
first issue of The Bulletin.
From the date of The Bulletin’s inaugural
publication its success was assured. It had at
once a dozen more or less servile imitators, many
of which even took, so far as was possible, its
name. They are now all dead, while The Bul-
letin continues the one phenomenal success in
Australian journalism, the one completely non-
local and distinctly universal Australasian news-
paper.
The Bulletin proprietary have spent sonif
thousands of pounds in fitting their buildings
with the latest appliances for high-class printing
and the production of illustrations, and they have
now issued The Bulletin in an entirely new
form—printed with new type of improved legi-
bility on the finest paper, and adorned with
sketches from the hands of the ablest and best-
paid newspaper artists Australia has over «■
The Bulletin is the only well established us-
tralian journal which, throughout its career, has
been consistently Radical. It {mints with pride
to the fact that for years it stood alone among
secular newspapers in advocating the Irish
National Cause, and that it was the only Aus-
tralian journal which denounced the Soudan
Expedition from its inception.
The Bulletin is the beacon-fire of national
progress : it is the forceful summons to the
crusade against the monopolies in land, wealth,
power, and privilege—the direct cause of halt the
misery which now afflicts British humanity.
Against the damns of avaricious clergy who claim
to monopolise salvation, aeainst the dark despotism
of grasping plutocrats, and against the exercise of
any human authority which has not been granted
by the people over whom it is exercised, The
Bulletin will fearlessly and ruthlessly contend.
The Bulletin, unlike the ordinary weekly
journal, is not loaded with a weight of matter
transferred from the columns of a daily paper
issued from the same office. The Bulletin is
not connected with any other paper, and the
matter it contains is all specially prepared by its
own unequalled staff.
The Bulletin is the journal which, of all Aus-
tralian journals, is most frequently quoted in Eng-
land, America, and the colonies.
The Bulletin, which is the only paper sold
by runners in the streets of every Australasian
capital, is the most widely-circulated of all papers
published south of the equator, and is the only
Australasian publication which enjoys a popu-
larity unhampered by the political boundaries
that so closely restrict other journals to the
colonies in which they are printed.
The Bulletin’s red cover is equally familiar
to the bushmau of the Far North, the stockman
of Central Au tralia, the pearl-sheller of Torres
Straits, and the digger in the Maoriland
Ranges. A paper which is at once the most
popular city publication and the organ of the
intelligent bushman must indeed be broadly based.
Perhaps the strongest proof of The Bulletin’s
popularity is found in the unchallengeable fact—
easily ascertainable from any postal official—that,
of all journals issued in Australasia, The Bul-
letin is the one most frequently remailed from
one reader to another.
The Bulletin is going ahead faster than any
other paper, because its vast mass of original and
specially-written reading matter is the brightest
and best, its illustrations the cleverest and most
artistic, and its policy the boldest and most
straightforward ever submitted to the Australian
public.

From Australia.
I Mr. W. H. Price, of Wells Silver Mine,
'Emmaville, N. S. W., writes as follows:
.‘‘To W. H. Soul k (Jo., (Agents forDi-.
• Pierce’s Belts and Trusses), 158 Pitt St.,
Sydney; Sirs;—I am in receipt of Belt
and books of instruction, and can safely
Bay that your advertisements are very truthful in regard to
the statement that a man feels the electrical strength of
thebeltassoon aslt is placed on his be dy, fori felt the ettect
of the belt as soon as I placed it on, and believe me, I am
a sure advocate of this belt.”
From England. . ,
Mb. Chas. Middleton, of No. 76 Aston St., Birmingham,
speaks as follows: “I can say that 1 have felt better, a great
deal, since I have used your Galvanic Chain Belt, and i
thank you very much. I have taken patent medicines but

could not do, for it has cured me of Sciatic Rheumatism

SATURDAY, JANUARY 13, 1894.
K.C.M.G.
The recent list of New Year “honours”
forms only an unappreciable addition to the
innumerable knights of Australasia, but none
the less it is, in a small way, another aggra-
vation of an already aggravated evil. The
latest “knights ” are mostly peaceful medio-
crities who are not likely to drag their
decorations through the police and insolvency
courts, as other ennobbled Australasians have
lately done, and that is probably the very
best that can be said for them. Poor,
ordinary, commonplace Jenkin Coles is pro-
bably about the most absolutely barren per-
sonage who ever had greatness thrust upon
him; and Manning, M.L.A., of Sydney, is
remarkable chiefly as a man who looks nice
in a dress-suit and as the author of an his-
toric grovel to a departed Governor. The
prospective elevation of Dr. Ren wick, of
Sydney, is chiefly remarkable because it
promises to adorn the Order of St. Michael
and St. George with an even flatter and
more utterly desolate individual than
.Ienkin Coles, and in this and other
respects Renwick will be worthy of the
Order, and the Order will be in every way
worthy of him. And several other persons,
whose knighthoods are looming in the near
future, will bo fit company for Renwick, for
the list of Australasian knights is like the
geography of the moon, and consists mostly
of a catalogue of dead craters standing use-
lessly among their own ashes.
• * •
Some day it will be interesting to read the
complete history of K.C.M.G.-ism in Aus-
tralasia, and see how patiently and persist-
ently the curse of the ancient butcher
of Cappadocia has followed the Order. The
list of K.C:M.G.’s is mostly a dismal record
of mediocrity, failure, disaster, general
wreck, and dishonoured old age. Graham
Berry was the typical man of the Order,
lie resigned the position of Tribune of the
People for his bauble, and now the same
Berry, aged 74 or thereabouts, feeble, poor,
broken-spirited and discredited, is seen
perspiring and hustling to make his way into
a tenth-rate banquet at a small Victorian
town, and when he attempts to utter a few
uncertain platitudes he is howled down
by the impatient mob. Berry’s title got
him a position on the directorate of the
Mercantile Bank, and the Mercantile
cleaned him out almost to the last coin.
Julius Vogel faded away almost exactly
in the same fashion as Berry, and his
latter years are just as hopeless and a
degree more impecunious. Pakkes looked
as if he was on his way to greatness when he
was blasted by a decoration, and now he is only
known as a tricky patriarch of many finan-
cial troubles, and many unprintable stories—
a hopeless old man of strange shifts and
expedients, and the most colossal failure in
Australian history. Dirbs got his title
and promptly took it into bankruptcy.
So did poor, weak, pompous Benjamin
Benjamin, of Melbourne. Matthew Davies
took his title into the Police Court instead,
and may presently take it into the dock so
that it may be cleaned and repaired before a
higher tribunal. M‘Oulloch, Griffith,
MTlwraith, Stout —but the list is too long
for recapitulation. The knights of Aus-
tralia are becoming as thick as leaves on
Vallombrosa, and they are, almost without
exception, a dreary catalogue of failures,
dull mediocrities and dishonoured renegades.
# * #
The knights that are to come are much the
same as those that have already arrived.
James Monro, unfortunately, was overtaken
by disaster before his title reached him, and
missed his opportunity. The circumstance
is much to be regretted, for the profoundly
serious old man with his two broken banks
and his queer building society, and his
melancholy umbrella, would have been a
congenial ornament to the Order. But the
ultimate elevation of Duncan Gillies is
almost certain, and that narrow, ignorant
schemer, with the oily smile and the shiny
countenance, will be another bright example
of the sort of merit which meets with im-
perial recognition. Gillies is the apotheosis
of the Commonplace—in fact, it is difficult
to imagine how any one man could contrive
to preserve such a dead level of intelligence
and such an utter dull-brownness of soul as
he has done for many years, and never have
even one bright or novel idea to relieve the
prevailing monotony. J. B. Patterson, the
blatant meat-individual, is obviously a coming
knight; and the elevation of the rotund
and blastiferous Bent is not impossible.
Looking down the long, dreary list of
Australian politicians, it is always possible to
select a dozen or two who, if they do not die
within a given time, or get into gaol, or
become insolvent under especially ugly cir-
cumstances, or be too publicly and con-
spicuously drunk or immoral, must inevitably
reach the distinction of a place in the Order
of St. Michael and St. George. The first
requisite is to be loyal and reasonably grovel-
sorne; the second is to be elderly, old-
established, commonplace, and profoundly
ordinary in every respect.
* • •
It is a notable fact that the miry ways of
politics are practically the only road to
titular distinction in Australasia. A man
may be great in any other walk of life, but
unless he is an old, case-hardened placeman
there is no K.C.M.G. -ship on his horizon.
The local nobility is a gathering of the
“old Parliamentary hands” of these pro-
vinces, and their wives—and nothing more.
Why the wife of the ennobbled one should,
in these days of women’s rights and separate
matrimonial estates, share his brand and
ear-mark and degradation is not easily
explained. If he has done anything great
or npble in politics, or anything especially
crawlsome or disgusting, or if he has earned
his distinction by being especially common
or ordinary in a public capacity for many
years, she has had no share in the matter.
Therefore, the Australian “lady,” like all
the rest of her kind, is merely an irrelevant
accident, somewhat after the fashion of the
traditional Texan “colonel,” who owes his
dignity to the fact that he married the widow
of another colonel deceased, the latter having
either earned his title while still in the flesh,
or having obtained it as a matter of courtesy.
Why the person who marries the widow of
a defunct K.C.M.G. does not, by an inver-
sion of the present rule, thereby become a
K.C.M.G. himself, is another matter which
is difficult of explanation. The much-
married K.C.M.G. may give his alleged
dignity to three or more wives in succession,
and there seems no coherent reason why his
relict, who has an equally lawful claim on
her end of the “dignity,” should not transfer
it to one or two or more husbands in like
manner.
• * #
By-and-bye, when the political woman
becomes a Parliamentary institution, the
question of titles will assume anew aspect.
It will be necessary then to ennobble the pro-
minent Parliamentary female—the masterful
personage who has stonewalled persistently
in a mortified-looking brown bonnet, and
has helped to form Cabinets and to overset
Ministries, and has slept in the House, with
her feet and her brown stockings on the
seat, and her reticule full of Parliamentary
papers under her head, when a falling
Government is holding the fort against
heavy odds, and has led forlorn hopes in
unfriendly constituencies against obloquy
and fierce opposition and eggs that have seen
their best days. Then it will be necessary
to consider whether the political woman shall
be made a knight and become Sir Sarah,
in which case her husband, who, in the usual
course of events, will boa meek nonentity
much given to lurking humbly in far corners,
will presumably be a “lady;” or- whether
she shall be made a knight, and her husband
be allowed to remain as he is ; or whether
her title, being in the female line, shall
reflect, not on her husband but on her
grandmother ; or whether she shall be made
a “lady” on her own account; or whether
her husband, or, in default of a husband,
her nearest male relative, shall be “elevated ’
to the rank of K.C.M.G., and she be
simply allowed to shine in his reflected gor-
geousness.
• * #
These are a few of the possibilities of the
Australian “peerage.” Meanwhile, knights
continue to multiply exceedingly and their
“ladies” grow so numerous that when a
woman of mental power and originality arises
in Australia she will presently petition
to be elevated to the rank of “Mrs.” in
order to be aloof from the ruck. Even if
the alleged decoration is only one degree
higher than the insignia of a jam-pot sus-
pended on a string, it grows oppressive when
it becomes too numerous, just as the honour
of being King Billy fell into contempt when
every male-member of the Australian abori-
ginal race began to lay claim to an elabor-
ately-engraven brass half-moon of his own.
Australia is fast drifting into that abject state
in which everybody is either King Billy or
his gin.
The Contingent Vote: Again
Editor Bulletin, Dibbs’ motives are, of
course, open to question, btit he is right in say-
ing the Contingent Vote would utterly smash
Labour. When it is remembered that there are
smug citizens all over the land who have fat-
tened by devotions at the shrine of Thrift
hoping to enter Parliament on the town-pump
vote, and on a scattering of the suffrages of the
more wavering supporters of Plutocracy and
Democracy, it cannot be denied that the Con-
tingent Vote system is an excellent device for
the promotion of their designs ; and when it is
considered that the interests of Capitalism, as
represented by the Pastoralists’ Association, the
Employers’ Union, the National Association,
and other like bodies throughout Australia, find
that their power to effectively combine against
the interests of the masses in the direct war
between Labour and Capital does not extend
to the political arena, and when they, from
this cause, fail to prevent two, three,
and even more would-be politicians, openly
or secretly of their social opinions, from
running in opposition to one Labour champion,
it is not to be wondered at if the Contingent
Vote system, which would enable them to back
the whole of their candidates and to obtain for,
at least, the more plausible of these, a share of
the Labour vote, should have ardentand actively-
interested partisans.
• ' # *
Such being the case, it is not surprising that
the present writer’s article, condemning the
Contingent Vote, should have provoked
responses from irate correspondents. My
critic, “F.R.,” virtually admits my chiefest
assertions—that men of pronounced opinions
would lose by the Contingent Vote. Thus says
“F.R. ”: “It is true that the Contingent
Vote, if generally used, would be disastrous to
* extremists,’ ” and forthwith he proceeds to
say who these would be. They would be “ the
Wingen Abbotts,” the “temperance hog,” the
man who wants to run the State for the sole sake
of “ Bung,” the advocate of general confisca-
tion of property, and the “ frenzist ” of every
cause, be it Labour, Capital, Drink or Social
Purity. These would all be left in the “ lurch,”
and that, he continues, is “just the virtue of
the Contingent Vote.”
* * #
Quite so, only that is precisely why the Con-
tingent Vote is the Vole of Stagnation, and
why it may be correctly described as the
apotheosis of mediocrity ; though with this
qualification—that the temperance fanatics, the
free-liquor advocates, and' the Social Purity
men, however frenzied some of them may be,
are in no place very numerous, and though
thousands may believe in prohibition, many in
free-liquor, and some m State puritanism, it is
safe to assert that in no part of the coun-
try will even a respectable minority of any
of these be found who will sink every
other consideration for the sake of their fad.
As things are, in the politics of Australia,
there is no man in Parliament who sits there,
solely, on the anti-beer, pro-beer, or pro-Bible
vote. Woman-suffrage, alone, is capable of
such a phenomenon. Like all similar suffrages,
the temperance-vote is divided every time
between the great contending factions of the
State; and, according to his taste, a strict
temperance elector may consistently support a
prohibitionist Freetrader, a prohibitionist Pro-
tectionist or a prohibitionist Social Democrat;
but the body of voters in any constituency who
would ukase that they wanted a candidate with
no principles but anti-beer ones, no ideas but
free-liquor ones, or no thoughts but Social
Gimlet ones, is scarcely to be found within the
limits of the State. Thus, these and all
similar sections of the community may be dis-
missed from this subject.
* « •
But how different is the case when you come
to the great crucial question which threatens
to absorb all others—the great issue between
the haves and the have-nots ; and, again, in a
less degree, between the rival fiscal factions !
Everywhere there are hosts of men who are for
Capitalism and class-rule, and masses of them
who are for Labour, and in either case
these will subordinate their opinions on
those subjects to no other consideration
whatsoever. Similarly, were the social
war non-existent, the rival fiscal partisans
would, swamping all minor issues, divide the
country between them, and do so, even now,
despite the Labour war, when the local circum-
stances give them a monopoly of the chances.
But, in face of tlie common foe of both
in the face of Labour—it is only too true,
“ F.R.” to the contrary notwithstanding, that
the rival fiscal factions cun make a truce for
the moment in order to assail the more success-
fully the deadly foe of both. Witness, for this,
the conduct of the Freetrade press of Sydney
in supporting, at several critical conjunctures,
the Protectionist administration when it was
denounced and attacked on behalf of the masses.
Only the other day a Freetrade candidate for a
suburban electorate was ypsited on by a deputa-
tion, representing the Protectionists of the
locality, who assured him that, Protection
being under a cloud, the adherents of
that policy had determined to risk no
forlorn hope, and would solidly support him
at the forthcoming'elections. The significance
of this fact lies in the circumstance that a
Labour candidate is in the field. What the
writer contends for in this connection is not that
there are not Labour Freetraders and Labour
Protectionists, but that, where the Democratic
sympathy of these is thorough, they will, in
all cases, give their primary vote to the cause
which is greatest, and when they see, as they
have seen on quite a number of occasions, the
rival journals and politicians of fiscaldom
standing shoulder to shoulder with the National
Association.To_.“ down ” Labour, it- cannot be
doubled that the cause which thus solidly
unites for its destruction the contending fac-
tions pf_dQaiiasicvatism. is. tlie.uia.user which is
greatest, the cause which is dearest to true
democrats of all fiscal tendencies.
* • »
It is considerations of this kind which make
it emphatically true that if, in the forthcoming
battle, the struggle be sometimes between
Freetrade and Protection, it will more often be
between Labour and the combined forces of
fiscalism, and, under present circumstances, a
multiplicity of candidates will by no means
obscure the issue, but merely give victory to
the side which is best disciplined ; whilst, in
every cose, the strong man, the firm man, who
is true to his party, be it Labour or Capitalism,,
will have the best chance. But different by
far would be the result of the Contingent Vote,,
for then not the strong man, nor the firm man,
but the middle man, the little-of-Labour indi-
vidual and the good-deal-of-Capi'tal personage
would come greatly to the front, to his honour
and profit, but little to the glory or gain of the
State.

Better a Parliament of M'Millans and!
Scheys than one of fat aldermen and in-
tellectual vacuity. Better the daring and*
domination of the Mountain than the hesitations
and stagnation of the Plain. Better men with,
faith and ideas, even if they be bad, than pur-
poseless creatures with no aspirations beyond;
their own comforts; yet, if you force on us the.-
Contingent Vote system, these last will arise
on the suffrages of uncertainty and intellectuals
vacuity, and stagnation and selfishness will be;
cast on our backs for three soul-killing years.

Thus far with “F.R.,” and now a word to-
“C.H.S.,” another critic who challenges the
statement that Griffith was the author, in
politics, of the Contingent Vole. The reply to
this is that Griffith was practically Dictator
of the Parliament which passed the Contingent
Vote, and, as the responsible head of
the Government, lie, and he alone, is.
accountable for the measure one, too,,
which rightly belonged to the Chief
Secretary’s Department. And even if Bar-
low, the Lands Minister, had anything
to do with the drafting of the Bill, the man who.
believes Griffith, the best Parliamentary
draftsman in the politics of Australia, would!
suffer a subordinate to frame and put through,
the Legislature, without the aid and concur-
rence of his chief, a measure of such importance-
as the Contingent instrument, is gifted with
more faith than is necessary for this age. —R.T..
A Bewildering- Verdict.
The dreary ninety days Victorian libel-ease of
Speight v. Syme was concluded last week.
Twelve jurymen, whose collective feebleness of
intellect became so obvious towards the finish
that the J udgp waxed satirical at their expense,
found a verdict which is a gross injustice to one
or other of the contending parties. Whether
the jury was more hazy than the Law, or the
Law was less hazy than Judge Hodges’ ex-
planation of it, are matters of general uncer-
tainty. There can be no intelligent doubt con-
cerning the illogical apportionment of damages
to the ex-Commissioner of Railways. Mr.
Speight charged the Age with having pub-
lished eleven distinct libels upon his personal
character, or business capacity, in the course of
a prolonged agitation for his dismissal from
office. The said agitation being a chief part
and parcel of the Age’s political policy—being,
in, fact a virtual.command from Davld Syme to
his vassal, Premier Shiels —resultedinSPEiGHT’s
ruin. Unlike the ninety-nine in every hundred
plaintiff's who sue newspapers for damages,
Speight had ample cause for complaint, unless
the Age could prove right up to the hilt the
truth and justice of the accusations which laid,
him low.
* # •
Speight was the hundredth individual who-
does indeed suffer real damage—not, be it re-
membered, from a chance paragraph, but from
a long and systematic attack with large type.
A libel-action, or the threat of one, at least,
was inevitable even before the Age had ceased
to attack and Speight had ceased to exist as
Railway Commissioner. That Speight, thrown
out of his billet and encumbered with private
liabilities, would ever succeed in fighting the
wealthy newspaper to a finish, was not antici-
pated. Awful legal obstacles were put in his
way in the hope that he would die of financial
starvation ere he could drag his case to court.
By the time Speight got there his grievance
was nothing if not substantial. A very differ-
ent case to that ,of the typical blackmailer of
the libel-court.
* * •
After Richard Speight had gone into the
witness-box—where his accusers said he would
not dare to go—and done his best to discredit
the Age charges—after counsel had said their
contradictory says and the learned Judge had
thrown a misty veil of lore over the merits of
this remarkable case, the jury retired to con-
sider its verdict, it transpired that one **£


the fateful twelve (and he probably spoke for
others beside himself) was troubled by an ina-
bility to remember all the points that he was
told to bear in mind. After two or three days’
consideration, the foreman positively could not
say for certain what decisions they had come to
upon each of the eleven counts, and he asked for
another two or three days in which to find out
the true position of affairs. Ultimately, the
Jurymen confirmed their first statement that they
could agree only upon one matter. Nine or
more of them considered that the Age was wrong
in stating that £250,000 worth of railway stores
had been stored unnecessarily, and were
deteriorated down to a value of £50,000, “ thus
showing a clear loss of £200,000.” This state-
ment they found to be, firstly a libel, secondly
an untruth, and thirdly not a fair comment.
On the remaining ten libel counts the jury
disagreed. The Age was in no instance sup-
ported by nine men, whereas in most cases
there were eight votes for Speight, it is said.
Under these circumstances the fixing of the
damages at £lOO looks like a concession by
eight of Speight’s supporters to one of his
opponents, who may have refused to be the
necessary ninth man unless they would pass the
paltry sum mentioned. It is incredible that
those who were with Speight on all, or nearly
all, of the counts would estimate the damage
effected by this particular libel at £lOO. If so,
they are very melancholy illustrations of
special-jury intelligence. On the other hand,
if the Age had a majority, or a bare
six supporters, upon all or most of
the ten disputed counts, then by all
common sense rules, Speight did not deserve
more than the orthodox farthing, which should
reward a victory that is legal, rather than
moral. Either has Speight been denied fair
compensation, or David Syme is robbed of the
“ moral victory ” he had a right to claim—and
does claim, as it is, without attempting to prove
his right. A farthing damages verdict would
have done that for him. The £lOO verdict
merely excites wonder as to the average opinion
of the muddle-headed jury, said wonder being
no greater than the certainty that their opinion
is worth very little anyway,
• # #
How, in the name of stupidity, did they
arrive at such an assessment ? A three-fourths
majority having decided in Speight’s favour
upon the one libel, the jury would naturally be
supposed to vote their individual estimates of
damages (after, perhaps, the majority had
agreed as to a maximum amount to be voted),
and divide the sum total by twelve, a plan
which gives the minority a show to reduce the
average by voting nil. Each juror would ex-
press his views on the whole case by the amount
he was prepared to award on the one count.
The result would be the same as if Speight
had confined himself to the particular libel that
lay in a plain question of fact. The jurymen did
not seize their one opportunity to act rationally.
J udge Hodges seemed to be at some pains not
to direct them so to do. He loaded them up
with Law, and the Law, which is always a
roguish hass, is such an especial hass in libel-
cases that the twelve—being a feeblecrowd easily
mastered by the animal—became mentally in-
competent to follow their inclinations.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Salvation in Fixed Dates.
The virtue of the death penalty as a tonic for
true repentance has often been suggested in
The Bulletin, but until last week no Christian
clergyman had openly supported the opinion of
this journal concerning gallows regeneration.
It remained for a cheerful Presbyterian, Rev.
A. J. Campbell, to go straight out for The
Bulletin doctrine in a letter to Melbourne
Argus. Mr. Campbell’s immediate purpose
was to promote the hanging of Mrs. Knorr, a
lady who ought, as it appears, to revel in her
doom, seeing that St. Paul once observed : “If
I have committed anything worthy of death I
refuse not to die.” That Scriptural quotation
alone sufficed to settle the reprieve question,
for it proved that if Paul had been a
female baby-farmer of the back-yard-burial
type he would not have declined to
fall through a platform at 10 a. mi. Mrs.
Knorr’s execution having received the official
sanction of religion, so to speak, Rev. Camp-
bell proceeded to show where the beauty of it
came in:—“ Indeed,” said the thoughtful
shepherd, “I am not sure that one who has been
doing great wickedness is not in a more favour-
able position for turning from it to God, and
seeking pardon at the Cross, when death is
certain on a day fixed and near at hand than
when it is postponed through a life-long im-
prisonment.” Mr. Campbell may feel quite
certain on this point. If salvation consists in
feeling much comforted by ghostly advice as
“ the hour ” approacheth there is no church on
earth to compare with the condemned cell for
saving influence. Life-long imprisonment is
not at all an infallible cure for sin, judging
from the people who try small or medium doses
of the remedy. “ Certain death on a day
uxed and near at hand ” is the best thing for
Mrs. Knorr’s soul. By the same token it must
be a most desirable finish for hundreds of other
Victorians whose wickedness has been con-
siderable, if not exactly great. And, inasmuch
as Rev. Campbell runs the risk of becoming a
backslider and a lost one himself (for no man
can guarantee his own godliness to be fireproof)'
then the State would do well to hang the
rev. gentleman upon the third Sunday of next
month, not because he is wicked, but in order
to make the assurance of such a good man’s
safety doubly sure.
Kanaka Politicians.
liie wrath of God has been to some extent
averted from Queensland by the supplications
cf several suffering sects ; and, as usual, some-
body else meanly steps in to take the credit of
the better prospects vouchsafed by PROVIDENCE
to that afflicted province. Sydney Telegraph
has interviewed Attorney-General Byrnes and
Minister for Lands Barlow, and each modestly
poses as the saviour of his country from the
horrors of white labour, just electoral, repre-
sentation, and the laud for the people. One
has a grey head ou green shoulders, the other a
green head on grey shoulders, but their impu-
dence is just about equal. Byrnes —to whom,
as a native of Queensland, there is the
greater damnation—extols the cheap Kanaka,
and says that every one at work means
work for a white man. This Is the
old, old lie. Byrnes knows that on
any plantation in Queensland —pick where he
will from Bundaberg to Cairns —it is rare to
find ten whites to a hundred Kanakas, mill-
hands included. The labour indirectly em-
ployed certainly won’t account for the other
90 per cent. Further, Byrnes’ apologia pro
Kanaka suo evades the point, which is this :
Is Queensland to become a community of half-
caste mongrels, with every white child depen-
dent for a living on the importation of a
Kanaka child to find work for it ? Byrnes
says it is. “ Coloured labour is popular to an
immense degree. No party would ever dare to
interfere with it.” This is a new lie, and The
Bulletin knows, if Byrnes does not, that
Queensland will some day—and soon—prove it
a new libel. Mr. Barlow chiefly dodders con-
cerning the contingent vote, a nightmare which a
perverse and sinful Queensland generation has
handed down to posterity as “ Barlow’s folly.”
It is time this abortion were forgotten until a
Government arises with the sense to strangle
it. Intended to stifle the democratic vote, its
chief effect was to relegate a whilom Minister
to obscurity. As this individual had cheerfully
included support of the contingent vote among
other prostitutions of his talents for the sake
of place and pelf, “Barlow’s folly” has not
been wholly in vain in the eyes of the Queens-
land democracy.
A “ Revenue Basis ” —for Freetrade.
The Argus is just now rabidly anxious to
increase the Vic. revenue by lowering all those
Customs duties which have checked importa-
tion and reduced Government supplies. The
Freetrader is, for the moment, a patriot, inas-
much as he would willingly shed every drop of
ink in his bottle to save the public exchequer.
For the Argus there is no possible, way of
attaining the desired surplus except by cutting
down protective duties and inducing a glorious
inflow of goods from Europe. A land-tax
would “ kill the farmers,” an income-tax would
“ prove ineffectual,” because nobody has an
income to put the tax upon, and, since things
are bad all round, Victoria’s last chance lies in
the proposed slaughter of the local manufac-
turer. There is something howlingly funny in
the Argus plea for putting “ the tariff substan-
tially upon a revenue basis.” The notion of a
country being so impecunious that it can only
manage to pay current expenses by procuring
its necessaries from a foreign shop is sugges-
tive of Gilbert and Sullivan opera. But the
average Victorian Freetrader takes it seriously.
According to his logic, a country that supplied
all its own needs could no longer support a
Government. Here is the logical conclusion of
the Freetrade theory that an increase in im-
portation is essential to the cure of a sick
Treasury. Incidentally it may be observed
that universal teetotalism—a great national
“ swearing off' it ’’—would rob an Exchequer of
visible means of support, whereas a sudden
abnormal consumption of foreign rum would
prove a blessing. It is all very droll, this
Argus story, but there is a moral in it. No
Victorian journal can be a protector of Fat
Man, the Revenue and the Farmer at the same
time. One of the three, at least, must be
abandoned. Seeing that Fat Man and the
Revenue are mixed up together in a mass of
Civil Service jobbery, why not dispense with
Revenue and kill the Government in preference
to the farmer? Heaven knows that Victoria
has much cause to curse its Government for
having been alive these last ten years.
“ Crushing the Liberal Party.”
Melbourne Age protests against the idea of
Speight, a ruined man, being able to raise
sufficient cash to support a libel-action against
the person who ruined him. In effect, the Age
says that Speight ought to have been kept out
of court by David Syme’s legal expenditure !
It was a disgraceful fact that he “ could ven-
ture to enter upon a transaction involving so
many immediate and contingent liabilities,”
because it proved, said the indignant Age, the
existence of “ a conspiracy to crush the Liberal
party.” What a Liberal line of argument!
The scandal of Speight’s action against the
Age really lay in its long postponement
whilst the mighty journal was fossicking
for means of dragging out the trial. The
cost of law is a sin against both parties,
under all circumstances, but a defendant who
encourages the law in its solemn swindle
by loading his defence with a mass of valueless
evidence with no visible result save waste of
time, has jar less cause for complaint than the
other fellow who strives to come to the point.
Syme’s case had crawled along for several
weeks before it showed a disposition to fight
Speight in real earnest, hence the general
belief that defendant’s counsel was manoeuvring
for a satisfactory compromise.
The Dirty Saints.
The latest news of that much - advertised
modern saint, W. T. Stead —the weird crank
who writes in Borderland concerning spooks
and goblins and the occult power of “ clair-
smellance ” —is that he has been preaching at
Chicago, where his manure-heap figures" of
speech have so aroused the city that he has
received a general notice to quit. Stead, in
the course of a deliverance at a ladies’ meeting,
told his auditors that they were “in many
respects worse than prostitutes hence the
trouble. The statement, in a broad sense,
was probably true, but the innate dirtiness of the
saint stands out conspicuously none the less.
It is a notable fact that most of the thrilling
saints of the day are more or less beastly—the
majority being more beastly. Poor old General
Booth, who has of late almost vanished out
of public remembrance, was eclipsed by the
meteoric rise of “Maiden Tribute” Stead, prin-
cipally through the want of judicious indecency.
Booth was always ignorant, hysterical and
foolish, and his hook - nose was suggestive
of the Hebrew money-lender, or the peadler of
Yankee “ notions ” rather than of the evan-
gelist, but even at his worst the gaunt old man
was never disgusting in his language, and when
another saint arose who was disgusting Booth’s
mana left him. Next to the Pope, Stead is pro-
bably thegreatest povverin the allegedly religious
world to-day. Most of the smaller stars in the
religious firmament seem to be built more or
less after his pattern. Varley, the glorified
meat-man, who had so great a vogue in Aus-
tralia, prospered chiefly through lecturing “ to
men only,” and being generally unfit for publi-
cation. That hoarse old songstress, Antoin-
ette Sterling, caused a furore, principally
because, no matter what subject she professed
to deal with, she presently drifted off to the
old, old story about the “ age of consent ”
and stayed there so long as her voice held out.
Antoinette’s popularity was merely another
evidence of the workings of the great law of
demand and supply. The clean saint may have
a short period of popularity, but there is no
permanent demand for him. It is only the
dirty saint that comes to stay, and the length
of time that he stays depends mostly on the
extent of his dirtiness. Are “ piety ” and
pruriency only different phases of the same
emotion ?
S.A. Advertiser publishes another letter from
“New Australia,” containing much joyful in-
formation about oranges and shady groves and
green verdure, and similar glories. An extract:
I only wish the poor old Bulletin critics could see us
now. They would then recognise the absurdity on their
prophesies anent_ the fate that awaited us in this country
of man-eating spiders and fierce mosquitoes.
The Bulletin here has to remind this excited
New Australian that the spider narratives re-
ferred not to Paraguay, but to the Argentine
plains, where the settlement was positively
located in the first instance, so the enthusiast
is out, as usual. Meanwhile, the New Australian
story is growing rather wearisome, by reason
of the columns of wild explanation in the daily
papers concerning the quarrels of the argonauts,
and the insinuations of tampering with her
correspondence levelled at the chief-pioneers,
by Mrs. Westwood, wife of the principal
seceder. This lady seems inclined to charge
them with intercepting letters which are not
sufficiently enthusiastic, and with a general
tendency to suppress communications which
are not bursting with fervour about oranges
and flowers and the like. Also, as the argo-
nauts are still living on the capital they brought
with them from Australia, and haven’t begun
to make a living under their new conditions,
the whooping is rather premature. The
latest news is that the next batch of argonauts
only take out one piano—the first lot, being
more enthusiastic, had two ; and that the cap-
tain of the Royal Tar has thrown up his post
owing to the insubordination of his crew of New
Australians.
One Pastor Savage, of Melbourne, has lately
been spreading himself in the papers upon the
threadbare subject of “godless education” in
Victoria. According to this good, but violent,
man, the population of Victoria, during the ten
years between 1881 and 1891, has increased 32
per cent, ; the total arrests have increased 46
per cent. ; illegitimate births have increased 49
per cent. ; and so on. And then comes the
overwhelming fact that the Sunday school atten-
dance has increased 50 per cent, in the same
period—from which it would seem that educa-
tion is becoming more gmlly instead of more
godless, and crime keeps growing as Sunday-
schools multiply. Further, the preacher goes
on to show that while crime is increasing
horribly in Victoria, in New South
Wales, which is almost equally “god-
less,” it is decreasing considerably. He
doesn’t attempt to account for this cir-
cumstance in any way. Next Statistician
Hayter rises to demonstrate that the good man’s
statistics are garbled and his conclusions unre-
liable. Victoria, he points out, contains a
vastly larger proportion of adults and a smaller
proportion of children than it did ten years
ago ; crime is almost exclusively committed by
adults; and the number of criminals, in propor-
tion to the adult population, has decreased
largely and is continuously decreasing. After
that the correspondence closes with another
outbreak from Parson Savage, in which he
dumps down his old assertion that crime arises
from “ godless education,” and leaves it at that.
Meanwhile the godly men of Melbourne con-
tinue to go to gaol in steady procession for
deficiency in the cash as heretofore.
Dear Bulletin, — I suppose what I’m going to
say here is a stale truism, but the fact
that it is known and glossed over makes it all
the more aggravating, and emphasises the all-
round rottenness of the New South Wales land-
laws. Not only is the “poor man without
capital ” hampered in a variety of ways in
settling on the land, but hundreds and thou-
sands of acres (to which they have no right) are
fenced in by squatters, semi-squatters and
managers of “bank” stations, and this fact,
though, of course, well-known to the neigh-
bouring landgrabbers, is unnoticed, because they
are in the same s-wim themselves. It would be
interesting to have laid before Parliament a
correct return, compiled by reliable authority—
most of those whose duty it is to look after such
matters are “ hand in glove ” with the pirates,
and therefore unreliable—showing the different
sections of Government land and their areas
fenced in and used by private parties with no
shadow of right. Take a strip of country —
say between Forbes and Bathurst—hardly a
Reserve or Common but is so enclosed, and the
traveller is driven off with threats and his
animals impounded. The brazen impudence
of some of these squatter kings is amazing, and
they know very well the trouble and incon-
venience it is to most, if not all, travellers to
go to law with them. Then they mostly have
traps —a chain or two of their legitimate pro-

A man scarcely dare travel these days unless
he has a heap of maps delineating every district
he happens to pass through. To follow the
evil and curse in all its ramifications would
entail too long a letter—but I may add that, often
after years of usurpation, the squatters so pull
the strings as to obtain the laud altogether by
misrepresenting that it is unused and lying
waste.—Yours, Bushman.
No statement as to tjie probability of York and
Duchess visiting Australia next year is worth
the newspaper it is printed on. People who
fabricate these yarns forget, or do not choose
to remember, the awful importance which
royalty attaches to babies in the “ direct line.’'
Presuming that May’s first infant prove to be a
girl, she will not come to Australia for fear of
endangering the prospects of a boy in posse.
And if, on the other hand, the coming stranger
be an heir, she will neither bring its august
little person to Australia nor leave it in Eng-
land whilst she fools around the Antipodes.
Nor, if the baby—boy or girl—died in infancy,
would she make the journey, for a reason afore-
mentioned. In short, merciful Providence has
ordained that no visit from George and May
shall occur, and those alleged Royal Family
consultations on the subject are the merest
journalistic moonshine.
J. V. Chataway, Queensland M.L.A., and
black-labour apologist, damns his own side
deliberately thus
The statement that white men cannot work in the
cane-fields anywhere south of Townsville is obviously
untrue. White men can work in fair comfort, except
during three or four months of the year. In proof of this
I may say that besides whites cutting several thousand
tons of cane this year, white famers grew, cut, and
delivered at the mills at least 15,000 tons of cane which
were never touched by a coloured labourer.
Nine-tenths of the Q. sugar-crop are grown
south of Townsville, so that nine-tenths ©f
the Kanakas in Queensland may be dispensed
with at a blow. Chatawav goes on to allege
that the industry cannot pay white men’s
wages—in defiance of the fact that the white
farmers’ co-operative mills at Mackay last
season £12,000 to £14,000 profit, or £2
10s. per ton of cane, after paying 14s. per ton
to the growers. The truth is that the only
justification for employing the Kanaka is greed
—simple greed.

“Girofld-Girofla,” an opera of no particular
place or date, but with a vague location on the
sea board of Bohemia, or thereabouts, has replaced
the “Royal Middy ” at Sydney Opera House.
The change is for the better ; there is more go in
the new production, and the chief objection to be
raised is the feeble efforts at localisation which
the co. makes as it goes along, and other un-
authorised interferences with the text. The opera
has that faint, far-off odour of medisevalism
which all the pre-Gilbert opera writers seemed to
consider indispensable. The artificial moss of the
dead centuries is upon it in spots, and the old-
time pirate with the shockingly-bashed hat is
introduced to lend an air of picturesqueness to
the story, likewise the brown-legged Moorish
marauder with the astonishingly short petticoat
and the saddle-coloured visage. And there is
much placid, blue and beautifully-painted Medi-
terranean in the far distance, with the lateen-sail
of old Dragut, or some equally outrageous
Moresco on the horizon, “ Girofle-Girofla ”is a
lively opera while it keeps going, and there are
cool and restful spots in between, when the pano-
rama of the Mediterranean feels like an iced
drink in a dry land amid a year of drought.

Miss Colbourne-Baber, as the twin sisters,
has improved. Her singing voice is as good as it
was, and her speaking voice is less uncertain than
la it week. Also a certain rustiness begotten of a
r vther prolonged absence from the operatic stage is
fading away; her hinges have been oiled, so to
speak, and she plays her part with an obvious and
e.icouraging sense of humour. Edward Farley
p ay s Mourzouk in an unrecognisable voice, and wi th
b'.oodthirsty vigour and an evident yearning for
human flesh; and Mr. Harry Craig presents a
wrinkled front to the character of Bolero, and
makes an unusual success out of that doddering
potentate. Further, the usually statuesque
Walshe, who generally seems as if he would like
to go out into the wilderness and think seriously
about his own extreme height, is less statuesque
than usual, and, in addition to being in excellent
voice, he throws himself about affably with the
abandon of a very large man who has cast off all
restraint. The rest of the co., barring one voice
which seems to come from the pirate in the
affrighted hat, is well up to the mark, and the
well-drilled chorus goes like one tight, or one
pair of tights, whichever the reader pleases.

“ Charley’s Aunt ” has taken deep root at
Syd iey Criterion, and the house is crammed
nightly. Still, a longer acquaintance with this
excellent and most unprecedentedly profitable
comedy reveals sundry serious defects. Probably
the worst of these is the long and agonising confab
between the Brazilian aunt and her adopted
daughter—a massive dialogue done in accents of
wailing, in the course of which they grievously
explain various things that the audience would
much sooner take for granted. This dialogue is
bad enough when it is heard for the first time ;
but the second time it is like a large presentation
of pig-lead. Also, the specially-imported mem-
bers of the com pany are dismally commonplace.
Two of them are understood to have been im-
ported because of their special knowledge of the
manners, dialect, and general tone of the Hinglish
student, but they merely succeed in demonstrating
that the Hinglish student is only a harmless dupli-
cate of anybody else.

Increased familiarity with the book of
“Beauty and the Beast,” at Sydney Lyceum,
confirms The Bulletin in its opinion that the
said book was written by the Beast. As the
cheerless publication, however, has practically
nothing to do with the show, this is a matter of
no importance. “ Beauty ” travels on its loose
gorgeousness, its utter irrespectiveness of expense,
its wild regardlessness of consequences and
Bartho. Every time this pantomime is witnessed
its lavishness strikes the observer afresh. Even
Nellie Stewart is only an incident in the
show, and Florence Young is another, and Bartho
herself doesn’t stand out so conspicuously as she
did. The effect of the whole dazzle is a general
feeling that one has been hit on the head with the
Koh-i-noor, and lias then gone out and taken an
oyster supper with a bird of Paradise. The bur-
den of “Beauty’s” magnificence grows weari-
some after a while, and when the auditor gets
away he wants to walk several times round a
church so as to bring himself back into a plain
and serious state of mind.

George Rignold’s pantomime of “Jack,
the Giant-Killer,” continues to do well at Sydney
Her Majesty’s, and the principal giant, who might
let himrelf out as a very reasonable church-spire,
looks as healthy as heretofore. At this show also
the utter and hopeless flabbergasted ness of the
book has been surmounted by excellent scenic
effects and the combined efforts of a good com-
Rany, aided by the fact that the lay of Marietta
Fash is not so hoarse as it was, that lady’s cold
having been judiciously treated with eucalyptus
rubbed into the chest. Therefore, The Bulletin
will merely remark that the said book ought to be
cast down a Cimmerian gulf into Erebus, and
there trodden underfoot by horned demons for
evermore.

Walton and Gourlay’s pantomime still
draws good houses at Sydney Royal, and the
funny man, who is a weak spot elsewhere, comes
out strong and well in the “ Babes.” George
Walton’s bold buccaneer is a comic sailor who
doesn’t need billing to that effect, and if all Babes
knew as much as Johnny Gourlay and the lemon-
ade bottle-supported Miss Harte, the occupation
of Mrs. Makin would not have been possible. A
pleasant thing about the “ Babes ” is the absence
of the girl in a yard of gauze and a wand, who
sings a knock-knee’d ballad about where the roses
bloom in the starlight from the footlights to hide
the muffled roar of the scene-shifters.

The “Crystal Maze,” at the Strand,
Sydney, n >w supplies its visitors with ice-creams
and refreshments gratis. The Maze is that curious
place of mirrors where the visitor gets lost among
innumerable reflections and can’t discover his way
out again, and the real ice-cream will be difficult
to find owing to the mirage of a thousand unreal
ioe-creams iu the glass.
Ihe magnificence of the pantomime at
Melb. Princess’s grows rather oppressive. Some-
how it smacks of a meeting between King
Salomon in his dotage, and the Queen of Sheba
when she had the ’ump. Cold splendour has
settled on the liver of the great production, and
its health is getting trampled down by processions.
Some people are even saying that Lonnen’s panto-
mime of last year was preferable to this, but The
Bulletin declines lo endorse any such extreme
statement. Nothing can be gloomier than the
haunting memory of Lonnen’s smile. Don Juan
de Somebody, whose castle is in Spain, now places
a chair upon the slack-wire and balances himself
upon the chair with Japanese precision, yet,
unless this skilled performer consents to in-
troduce a shocking accident by way of novelty,
he will soon be reckoned dear at JB70 a
week. Boy Blue and Red Riding Hood pall
upon the public taste, whilst Simple Simon
is enlarging into a theme for general exe-
cration. The intentions of Simon are strictly
honourable, of course, but his humour taxes the
resources of the Australian language to their
utmost. He is as painful as a whitlow on one’s
wounded spirit. Last week this gruesome mummer
introduced a larger stuffed dog than his previous
stuffed dog, with the remark that it had become a
Freetrader after its eyes were opened. For-
tunately this musty wheeze will assuredly be
withdrawn to oblige the Age, which is a
Protectionist journal. For the Age’s iron
hand has already made one little grab at
the managerial throat of W. and M., even
as, three years ago, it tried to choke George
Coppin. He chokes loudest who chokes last.
Topical allusions likely to distress the Age are
strictly prohibited, ’tis said. For example, there
is a song with the tender refrain of “It takes a
girl to do it every time.” Suppose the warbler
were to try a new verse after this style :
Our Jones has just departed from a weary world of woe ;
He will jerk the fatal lever nevermore ;
Though he did a lot of damage to his brothers here below
He drew ihe line at killing Mrs. Knorr.
A dozen trousered Deernings he could drop without a sob,
And see their bodies laid in prison lime ;
O, to make a common hangman get disgusted with his
job—
It takes a girl to do it every time.
Would that verse reflect Age sentiments concern-
ing capital punishment for women ? No.

Dan Barry’s drama of bygone days is
holding on for a third week at the Alexandra.
They did droll things in the early infancy of this
young country. Bushrangers had a way of pur-
loining poor selectors in order that their wives
might raise the necessary ransom from a long,
lean squatter on terms which a sixpenny periodical
would blush to mention. However, seeing that
the ladies always escaped with their honours thick
upon them, leaving the bloated capitalist to come
to a bad end, it is a matter for regret that
Providence can’t push back the universe to the
days of auld lang syne. Barry’s capable company
has come to stay, seemingly. Next Saturday
(13th) is to dawn upon the production of a new
and exciting drama by Scudamore, a famous
English dealer in rampageous works of art.

Maggie Moore, with the Melb. Royal
panto, in tow, is steaming along at high pressure.
Garnet Walch built this seaworthy craft—mean-
ing the panto., not M.M.—and every here and
there he hammered in a brass-headed joke, carry-
ing a point at its latter end. “ Sinbad ” has also
solid pretensions to amuse children, which is no
small matter as things go. When a boy laughs,
his honoured parent can usually laugh with him,
whereas the old man may chuckle for ten minutes
on his own account without extracting the least
mirth from the members of his family. A fine,
substantial fairy Queen is a useful item at the
Royal. This lady has a cheerful, worldly way
with her, indicating that her mother was a prac-
tical fairy, who married a mortal. Tom Queen’s
acrobatic business has been well thought out,
and the Permans seem specially pleasing in
that they are known to comprise a pair of
genuine brothers and a real pretty sister. There is
a certain fresh and breezy innocence about a Bella
dancing under these conditions, a frank and free
clasping of hands and waists. Now, the ordinary
stage brother is too evidently married to his
“ sister.” Their pretence at being on affectionate
terms is ghastly in the extreme, Leumane is not
very breezy, but his old, reliable top-note can find
its way to the roof, a portion of the building which
is nightly lifted off by Grist’s panorama and
Brunton’s transformation-scene. The transfor-
mation in question dates back to last Xmas, but
it shines again with undiminished lustre.

J. 0. Williamson sailed for London on
Tuesday of this week in quest of general novelties
—and another Gaiety Company, perhaps. Thus
far he has dissembled this deadly purpose.
At Poverty Point.
During last Melb. floods showman Kreitmeyer lived
down Richmond way. Ue had a number of effigies in
the back-shed; these were all washed down the Yarra,
and the spectacle of a fat gentleman who dived in only to
rescue a golden-haired wax Cleopatra much amused the
sorrowing neighbourhood. He simply stamped the
object of his solicitude into pulp—and then had to pay
for his heroism.
Since the retirement of Dr. Neild there has been in
Melbourne no essentially dramatic critic who is permitted
to be a specialist at the work. Reporting the meeting of
shareholders of the Jupiter Pluvius Building Society in
the day, and criticising the new play at the Prin jess’s the
same night is part of the fitness of things. Often the
reporters don’t go near the theatre at all. In a recent
notice on somebody’s concert the “ finished playing of
Monsieur Tremolo on the oboe ” was complimentarily
referred to in about half-a-dozen lines. But that cannot
be finished which was not beeun, and it so happened that
Monsieur Tremolo, being ill, his number was cut out
entirely. In one of the dailies “A Bad Penny” was
alluded to as “ an amusing little farce.”
Two tiny twin sisters are the best joke in Melb. Royal
panto. They have two little companion parts to play
and each toddler tries to take the shine out of the other.
They come to words, even to slaps, on the stage, and are
said to have a mutual undying hatred. About four years
old they’ must be—or perhaps nine years between them.
Somebody wrote to Courtneidge, the other day, stating
thit he had recently returned from America with the
music ot a new song which would certainly ‘‘become
popular” in Australia if Courtneidge cared to introduce
it to the public. This startling novelty, the writer went
on to disclose, was “ The Oat Caine Back.”
Rev. John Reid, of Melb. S lakespeare’e Society, was
once a professional actor, and took lago to Brooke’s
Othello, in Edinburgh.
Charles Warner, Charles Cartwright and Agnes Thomas
are all in the cast of the Adelphi drama, “A Woman's
Revenge." Cartwright plays the villain, and his “callous
truculence " is described as a revelation in stage villainy.
A revelation, forsooth I ’Tis the man’s natural manner—
he is always more or less of the bearish Russian prince
that he represented in “ Moths."
“ Bluetail Fly ” Barlow is 75.
Dora Mostyn is lengths ahead of any other member of
Dan Barry’s co. in Melb. favour, and would have livened
up either of the pantomimes. Eugenie Duggan, who
debuted as Juliet, returns as a rather gaspy melodramatic
heroine.
In revenge for a rough notice in a Maryborough (Q.)
paper, Ridge’s circus hand came in six-horse splendour
and serenaded the staff with the “ Dead March in Saul.”
Seven of the editor’s teeth dropped right out.
The Dampiers are giving Rockhampton (Q.) a miscel-
laneous treat—from “ Darkest London " to “ Romeo and
Juliet.” Local paper says Rolfe, in latter play, was a
“ fervent, yet gentle, Romeo." Nobody doubts it.
Clement Scott calls the prevailing tendency of the
stage “ the dramatisation of contagious diseases acts."
Capt. Humphreys, the ex-lion-tamer, or rather what
remains of that much-chewed veteran, has now taken to
safer business, and is agent and lecturer for a preparation
called “Chloe Oil," warranted to cure rheumatism,
sciatica, lumbago, sprains, bruises, chest complaints,
neuralgia, sores, chilblains, burns and bites of insects.
Anyone who goes up or down Sydney Harbour is bound
to hear of Chloe Oil, for its painted “ad." disfigures
nearly every beauty spot from the Heads to the top of
Lane Cove.
Hard to imagine that the most pompous Melb. boniface
once acted pantaloon.
Mary Weir’s Danse Lumineuse, at Melb. Princess’s,
looks rather like hanging out the family wash by lantern-
light.
At a “Red Riding Hood” rehearsal Vi Varley was
listening to Ethel Haydon’s lines. “Those are two good
lines,” she interrupted ; “I’d like them myself." And
she forthwith “ snavelled ” them. An appeal unto Caesar
confirmed Miss V.’s decision.
A lot of Melb. girls have taken to learning Italian, the
mellifluous language of the fascinating Giraud and his
compeers. Giraud’s English didn’t get further than
“Oh, yes,” and “whisky.” Then it gave out, and he had
to thank the shouter in French. Caruson was the society
man of the troupe. He looked a dapper little soul in
dress clothes.
Alfred Dampier, reminiscently of the days of G. V.
Brooke: “Ah! those were the days when companies
were like families, and actors did not steal each other’s
plays and produce them under other names."
Essie Jenyns (Mrs. John Wood) and her husband are
returning to Sydney per s.s. Himalaya.
Mr. and Mrs. Q. B. W. Lewis contemplate a tour in
South Africa. Neither of them is quite young enough to
make a big success in the new Tom Tiddler’s ground.
They rely in some degree upon the good offices of Lady
Loch, but vice-royalty counts for little amongst the
Afrikanders, especially just now when their backs are
up with Downing-street about the Matabele business.
Courtneidge, the actor, was the innocent means of
getting an unanimous theatre verdict in the great rail-
way libel-case. The bare news of £lOO damages for
Speight was telephoned to Melb, Princess’. By the time
it reached the stage, where the pantomime was proceed-
ing, the £lOO had increased seventyfold. When Court-
neidge brought out a wheeze to the effect that Speight
would draw £7OOO from David Syme, the audience
applauded like one great clap of thunder. There was but
a single dissentient, who complained in a piping treble
that the amount wasn’t half enough. About 99 per cent,
of the house cheered vigorously. Among the one
per cent, that didn’t jubilate was Purves, Q. 0.,
and he rushed from the dress-circle, vowing that
Courtneidge had plotted to bring contumely upon
a noble newspaper. For a time it was understood
that Purves would commit the comedian for contempt of
court, or something. Subsequently they liquored up
together and Courtneidge announced, “by special desire,”
that Speight’s verdict was for £lOO and not £7OOO.
Whereat the audience murmured “ O-o-oh ” in accents of
heartfelt sorrow.
Mrs. Kendall, from the New York stage: *‘l will not
Bay good-bye. I love you Americans, with your tiny
hands, and your tiny feet, and your great, big, generous
hearts.” Ugh I
A Sydney daily paper amusingly asserts that it was
Sydney which discovered Ada Cro-sley’s beautiful voice.
The fact that Miss Crossley was Mine. Fanny Simonsen’s
favourite pupil clearly shows who effectually discovered
her.
Miss Dora Ohlfsen Bagg6, of Sydney, writing from
Berlin, says that she met Melba, who looked just the
same as ever, and is considered quite a beauty by Con-
tinental opera-goers. Frances Saville, when she appeared
at the Imperial Opera House as Marguerite, looked per-
fectly lovely, though her rendering of the part was
generally considered much too coquettish and vivacious.
A squabble boiled down. Certain single men brought
certain ladies around with the show. The married
men’s whei objected. Bad language, and gentlemen
whose heads lay on mats o’ nights while their legs were
slacked perpendicularly upstairs.
A leading London theatrical agent affirms that 70 per
cent, of English actors and actresses are out of work.
He counts 97 “juvenile ladies” disengaged out of 236,
and 215 “second juveniles " out of 315.
The chorus of the coming burlesque song—from “ Don
Juan”—which will presently extinguish “Dysy,” runs
thus:
Linger longer, Lucy—linger longer, Loo
How I love to linger, Lucy, ’long o’ you.
Listen while I sing—ah! promise you’ll be true;
Linger longer, longer linger, linger longer, Loo.
One of Arthur Roberts’mild jokelets in “Don Juan"
consists in wearing a bathing costume and floundering
about on the stage after the manner of a stout, elderly
gentleman in shallow water, with a bathing song accom-
paniment. When this item came on the first night, critic
Archer rose and sternly departed the premises.
The item in the “ Don Juan " burlesque which led to
the intervention of the Ottoman Ambassador was the
violent and opprobrious kicking of the Sultan of Turkey
all over the stage. The Bulletin’s old friend, Oarington,
as the chief official censor of plays, had passed the offen-
sive item, which is another serious reflection on Cham-
pagne Smith’s intelligence, or whatever he calls it.
Writing of an elderly actress, a critic once said: “Her
beautiful diamond necklace reminds one of a lantern on a
wreck.”
A well-known Australian actor was one night playing
an old man part, and in the interval he took off his wig
to cool his parched head and forgot all about it. When
the curtain rose on the second act he burst in without it.
The other man, however, was equal to the occasion and
said: “It is not you 1 want, but your father.” Then
the actor bolted off and presently re-entered with his
wig. “Warned by my son,” he said, gravely, “ I have
hastened hither.”
Poor Chicago ! Dibbs damns the men—

846 Macquarie-street North, Sydney,

My Dear Moorabinda—
Sydney D.T.’s yard-and-a-half of stuff on the
subject of His Excellency Sir Robert Duff, meant
to pacify the enraged Macdougals, and so on,
wouldn’t deceive an infant. Regarded as an in-
spired defence, it is simply abject in its clumsi-
ness.
One thing is clearly shown by all this awkward-
ness—Sir Robert Duff is not an airy diplomat
who does what he likes and yet keeps everybody
in a simmer of loyalty. Imagine with what facile
humour, what graceful persiflage, such a man as
Lord Rosebery—the Governor who might have
been (not that there was ever much chance of his
coming)—would have disposed of the clumsy
“scene” created by those tactless Scotchmen!
Gov. Duff's impolitic apologetic speech, at the
Commercial Travellers’ dinner, was altogether in
the wrong vein. He “ understood that even a
Governor was allowed to have his Xmas holidays
to himself.” But did he really imagine that the
Scotchmen would give a whiskyless holiday to a
“ brither,” or think to escape them on New Year’s
Day?
If what one viceroy does the next must do, I
really think that (judging from the strained
relations between N.S.W. Govmentouse and the
local Hielandmen, on account of the Governor
not being present —for the first time in 25 years—
at their annual festival) the first care of a
Governor should be as to how his acts will affect his
successor. An itinerant Governor should curb
his wandering propensities lest, when a lazier
potentate comes along, the men of Dog Elat
should be heard hooting in the distance because
His Ex. won’t journey 6000 miles to open a
pumpkin-show.
The satrap who loves to be popular and is
pleased to pumphandle the multitude at frequent
intervals, in order to be cheered on his departure,
might pause and reflect what sort of a row will
occur if the next man happens to resent the claw-
ing process? And if Governors won’t consider
one another there should be framed reg’lations
hung up in every Govmentouse for the guidance
and protection of the various vice-regalities. At
present a Governor governs according to his idio-
syncrasy, and every man has an uphill fight to
make his particular method of- civilising the
savages popular.
Gov. Duff’s foiled admirers, who are only fair-
weather friends, seemingly, should remember,
when they are airing their soreness, that His Ex.
came here as an admittedly professional Governor
and that he attends all official shivoos at his own
pleasure entirely. To what extent a Governor
may exclude himself, if he choose, was sternly
shown by Lord Augustus Loftus, who calmly
turned Sydney’s social starting-point into a
poultry-yard and stoically stayed out his term of
office, despite the outcries of the baffled female in
a yellow bonnet who sought to be a sister to Lady
The men in kilts should remember
that His Ex. can, if he so pleases, take to grow-
ing cabbages in the’ Inner Domain and retire to
undisturbed contemplation of the speechless slug.
Damsels who adopt fiercely-public callings must
expect a few shocks now and then, but it is doubt-
ful if anybody has ever got such a staggerer in the
very blush of her wild career as did a certain Aus-
tralian society young lady who is encouraging her
dramatic genius by donning the fleshings of a
figurante. The thing occurred at a dress rehear-
sal, The society girl, unbroken to the compass-
like straddlings of Flossie, refused to widen her
pedestal at the stage-manager’s bidding, upon
which that case-hardened individual remarked—
well, I’d really like to say just what he said as a
warning to young ladies who regard the stage as
their excelsior; but I won’t, because I cannot
here talk behind my fan.
But dissuading a maiden from her chosen Fate
is always an ungrateful undertaking. The girl
who is “ called ” to be a Sister Dora, with dreams
of spooning jelly all over the nice moustache of
some grateful patient who wears navy serge and
brass buttons when “in condition,” never sees
that her genius lies in quite a different direction
until she is called upon to wash a dead Chinese
hawker. And all the full-flavoured stage-mana-
gerials in creation would not. scare one dogged
girl out of the notion that she is the makings of
the only Juliet.
Dr. Youl, the Melbourne Coroner, soared far
above red-tape in his crisp contempt for the chief
cause of the recent sensational double-drowning at
St. Kilda. A girl who had loved Mr. Birtles
too well jumped off the pier, whereupon Mr. B.
calmly looked round for a life buoy, while a gal-
lant stranger named William Satchell (leaving his
own sweetheart for ever) dived in to save the girl,
and was drowned in the attempt. At the double-
inquest Birtles told the plain, ugly truth, to the
expressed contempt of the Coroner, who, like all
legal officials, expects the most unblushing perjury
where a woman is concerned, although it is his


Oh ! draught divine, that adds new life—breeds

official duty to thresh out the truth, the whole
truth, and nothing but the truth—or why make
people kiss the book about it?
But the fact is that Truth isn’t Justice, nor is
Justice Truth—they are two separate figures.
Their allegories are two distinct women, and you
may palliate one or the other, not necessarily
both. All that a Court wants to happen is Jus-
tice, and unpleasant facts don’t always help
along the consummation. That, I presume, is
what Dr. Youl means to convey.
I have often thought that the lies (the best
specimens occur every day in the divorce-courts)
men brazenly tell when the cat is out of the bag,
are a good cloak that chivalry lends to the man
whose stage-heroic magnanimity shields himself
as well ks the woman. I know lam pleading an
unpopular and unheroic, and, if you like, essen-
tially contemptible cause, but, all the same, we
ought not to be too severe on Birtles. The same-
want of nerve which stopped him from jumping
into the water and saving the wreck he was
responsible for, probably induced him to tell
astonishing and unprecedented truths when he
attended the inquest. Lies and nerve are often
convertible terms —a nervous person states bald
and hideous facts because he hasn’t the cool
assurance to carry out a pleasant and feasible
fiction.
The minute received from Attorney-General
Heydon by the Newcastle (N.S.W.) Council to
the effect that “the bye-laws recently framed
authorising the bathing on the sea-beach by per-
sons of either sex were ultra vires ,” may be good
law, but all the same it is most characteristic of
the present regime ! The new Attorney-General
is a most austere gentleman who seems always on
the verge of tying a rope round his waist and
bolting into a friary away from this wicked world.
Not even the wildest flight of fancy could picture
any woman taking an especial delight in diving
after cockles with the Honorable Mr. Heydon.
While even one solitary male professor of
Natation exists you can’t say there is no such
thing as dual bathing; and by forbidding the
general mingling, I take it that you censure every
woman who is taught how to float by Professor
Jellyfish? Which somehow reminds me of an
over-true incident that happened recently at a
ladies’ bath in a fashionable Sydney Harbour
suburb. The wife of a local resident had been
taught a double-somersault by her husband, and
during the bath she requested the company —in-
cluding the professor—to act as audience while
she turned a flip-flap into the water; so they all
ranged round the brink. “ Mind you watch me
carefully,” said the heroine, and then over she
went —but even bathing-suits wear out, and —but
let me draw the metaphorical veil which was so
much needed actually. The bathing-man simply
fled, while«the women on the edge felt that death
would have been sweeter.
It isn’t often that two bad authors get
grievously wounded in their tenderest feelings
almost in the same hour, but that is what happened
on opening-night to the merciless composers of a
couple of Baratarian pantomimes. The lessee of
one house sat behind the author of the rival show
in company with an artist. “Great Caesar! it’s
as bad as our man’s book,” quoth the lessee,
unconscious that the criminal was wriggling in
front.
Afterwards, at aspirituous rendezvous, the artist
met the author of the other pantomime, who was
personally unknown to him. “You should have
heard how Bratus Snap gave it to the author of
‘Blue Beans,’” he said, confidentially. “There
he was, sitting close by, and Snap said, * Great
Caesar! it’s as bad as our man’s book.’” How-
ever, the worse the poet the thicker the hide.
Probably he only smiled pityingly, and remarked
that his wit was a littlo too subtle for some
people.
revelry, I am told, led to a unique
spectacle in a N.S.W. country town. The local
parson had an emu which was greatly addicted to
strong drink, so whenever the local youths felt
inclined for a little diversion they made the bob-
tail fowl as irresponsible as the legendary Chloe.
On Xmas eve a bright thought occurred to the
bird’s admirers, and they stole silently up to the
parsonage paddock, while the priest was at tea,
and intoxicated the willing emu as usual. Then
they put a pair of snowy-white, tucked-and-frilled
garments on the emu’s staggering legs, a gathered
shirt sat well on the jutting wings and tail, and
when the dress-hat had been tied on to its dodder-
ing head, the toilet was complete. Then they
turned it loose into the township in the glow of
the setting sun.
Tufuhan, Tonga’s brand-new 17-years-old King,
is said to be a handsome youth, rapidly spreading
into obesity. On his arrival from Fiji the match-
making crones of his kingdom set about finding a
bride tor him, settling on a girl of 11 and another
of 12 as the Queen. But Tufuhau had learnt
more than English in Fiji, so he calmly dismissed
the candidates and expressed hia intention of re-
maining a bachelor—certainly a unique state in
which to find a king. The unmarried potentate
doesn’t occur half often enough in the Court cir-
culars. Any colour-blind itinerant spinster who
yearns after a kindred soul might bear this royal
bachelor in mind when setting out on her travels.
While Mr. Gal ton, the N.S.W. vice-regal private
secretary, “ was waltzing in a ballroom last season
it was noticed that he had something bulky inside
his vest. The mystery, which was the occasion of
much gossip, was understood later on when the
private secretary was seen in a quiet corner of the
room reading a Greek Homer.” Imagine the
fearful joy of the hostess as she recognised her in-
ability to amuse this learned man ! And fancy a
Guvmentouse young man sitting down to pore
over a dead Greek when he might have been
studying a live Sydney woman 1
The dreadfully sudden death of Mr, George
Rowley, secretary of the Rosehill and Kensington
Race Clubs, who was killed in a buggy accident
on New Year’s Eve, will not be soon forgotten,
for he will be greatly missed. In accordance with
a wish expressed in his will there were no mourn-
ing coaches and no hearse, and the coffin was
carried to the grave on the shoulders of eight
friends.
That is, after all, a true test of friendship. How
many of us are sure that we have eight true
friends who would perform such a sad duty in a
tender spirit—and how many of ns are true
enough friends ourselves to merit such a final
mark of love? However, some people have a
swarm of acquaintances in the guise of friends
who would be rather glad of the chance to carry
them to the grave, and plant them as deep as pos-
sible.
“ Charley’s Aunt ” has galvanized all the old
B. & B. enthusiasm into life at Sydney Criterion.
In the curtain-lifter, “A Bad Penny,” there is
not much dressing, and in one instance not dress-
ing enough. There is a certain unwritten law re
the perforations of the clothes of the stage dead-
beat, whom the “unities” never allow to be ven-
tilated above the knee-cap, however wildly moths
may behave in nature.
The only Frank Thornton wore a rich black
satin gown as the Aunt, but the dressmaker takes
a welcome back seat in the comedy, which has
more than rags to run on. The ohirrupy Miss
Dot Frederics (Mrs. Arnold) wore a very dreamy
confection in the faint colours of French candy in
the last act, and Miss Agnes Knight, in a grey
and white gown, looked like an impressionist idea
of a seagull.
“Charley’s Aunt” is sprinkled with jaunty
speeches embodying many sophistries. For in-
stance, “a buttonholer takes ten years off a man’s
life,” is only true up to a certain point. For my
part, whenever I see an overblown male with a
boutonniere I always look closer to see what par-
ticular ravage of time it’s a cloak for. If the
decoration is gaudy scarlet, it is generally sported
to subdue the warm nose-tints, and if it is large
and yellow it’s always worn to counteract facial
evidence to the effect that the liver moves in a
mysterious way its wonders to perform ; while an
elderly man with a white flower always strikes one
as anticipating the floralities of his own funeral.
An old man with a flower in his coat is almost as
hideous as an old woman with rouged lips.
Another thing that ruffled me in Brandon
Thomas’s play was the real aunt’s silly “good
story ” when the men were “off.” I confess my
flesh crept a little just there, because it is an
exploded notion that women’s stories are point-
less things. For, though the average man has
merely to recapitulate some of his personal experi-
ences to amuse the club, while, for obvious
reasons, a woman daren’t make use of any spicy
personal memoirs of her own to liven up the tea-
table, still there are she-stories in the third person
that end just a little more definitely than Donna
Lucia’s. Men judge a woman’s genius for point-
finding by the studied imbecilities that she
designedly treats them to; but clever women
don’t judge a man’s ability as a raconteur by what
they hear him talking about. At least, no mar-
ried woman does.
I wonder whether there was more tea-drinking
than beer-drinking at the Maoriland elections this
week? And did the papers come out with
accounts of the “Toilettes at the Booths?”
It is cabled that Maria Jones, a member of the
London Gaiety Co. which visited Australia last,
is dead. Maria weighed more than half-an-ounce,
and her funniest aspect was when she used to
fall in the garden-scene of “Faust up to Date ”
and shake the property trees to the roots. My
most vivid recollection of the lady is a vision of
her as Martha, walking into the wings amorously
clinging to the arm of Lonnen, dressed as the
Devil.
The extremely amusing pantomime,' “ Babes in
the Wood,” at Sydney Royal, “ isn’t too dressy but
just dressy enough,” in the words of George
Walton. I liked Miss Cecily {Staunton’s yellow
satin dress with clusters round the flounce of blue
cornflowers—cornflower velvet bodice and a
butterfly headdress of spangled lace and corn-
flowers. Miss Staunton wore an unusual mixture
of blue and brown in the last act, when Flora
Hastings was gorgeously arrayed in mulberry
satin with petticoat and half sleeves of lavender
silk brocaded in purple velvet flowers —Eliza-
bethan collar of white lace and stage diamonds
everywhere. The lively Ada Juneen looked
prettiest in a satin sailor-suit with pale-blue
tights, and the most gorgeous Queen in the
chronologically-correct procession was Elizabeth
in white satin embroidered in gold and pearls and
priceless jewels, seemingly. I didn’t like one
thing about the final transformation. That pale-
blue girl rising from a split bivalve was too fear-
fully suggestive of a figurante on a half-shell.
I have from Mr. Charles Arnold a copy of his
“Hans the Boatman” song-book, including the
bound-to-be popular “Tommy Atkins * song which
has not yet been sung in Sydney, and will be one

Dear Bulletin, —More traces of Leich-
hardt ! Numbers of half-castes have recently
been discovered in Port Darwin (N.T.), and in
Perth (W.A.), and at intermediate ports. Poor
Leichhardt and party must have put in much
time on the coast —they can be traced back fully
40 years by the ages of the half-castes, if the fore-
going reasoning be correct. In fact, Leichhardt
and party must have been here within the last 12
months, as we have half-castes a few weeks old.
Baby half-castes are called “ little Leichhardts ”
here in Port Darwin. —Boko.

The bebaubled E. T. Smith “ has declined
the overtures of both political parties ” to stand as
a candidate for the Commons in his native borough
of Wallsall; and also further declines to re-enter
South Australian politics. This is “ Moiety ”
Smith, who, when Mayor of Adelaide, declared
that the local fire-brigade fund should be thus
contributed —one moiety by Govt., one moiety by
the fire-insurance societies, and one moiety by the
Corporation ! Smith, from being a humble employe
of the Kent Town Brewery (Adelaide), became the
owner of that establishment. The mayoral con-
test between him and the pious John Colton, in
the year in which “ the princes ” were coming in
H.M.S. Bacchante, is historic, and cost Smith a
few thousands. The Adelaide press then pro-
phesied that Mayor Smith, who was chiefly
remarkable for a long beard and longer generosity,
would be made a Bart.
Miss Jessie Ackerman, the she-evangelist
from Boston, who lately infested Australia, has
got “ Hum ” after pervading this tired sphere for
five years. She travelled 100,000 miles; visited
502 cities; held 1417 meetings; delivered 870
lectures and 447 addresses ; spoke on 41 vessels ;
visited 290 schools and 69 Bands of Hope ; preached
in 182 pulpits; initiated 647 Good Templers and
about 8000 other teetotallers ; visited 897 public-
houses, and remonstrated with the people drinking
therein; established about 250 lodges ; marched
at the head of processions in 52 different cities ;
received 3486 letters; wrote 5947 letters, 420 news-
paper articles, 220 letters to European papers ; and
published 60,000 tracts. Also, she travelled by
camel, horse, mule and elephant; steamers, skiffs,
sailing vessels and junks, stage, carriage, ekka,
tonga, jeninch, buffalo, bullock and camel carts,
garah, sedan chair, palanquin and wheelbarrow,
and went down in a diving-bell. Truly it is
an awful record of fast trotting and wasted loco-
motion and the wild skurryings of a jawful female
over five continents. There is no land so remote
that the flop of her loose shoes hasn’t been heard,
and her skirts haven’t raised a dust there, and
there is no known highway where she hasn’t fled
along as a horrid example of the Woman who
Won’t Keep Still.
So many “Australian” stories are just
now seeing the light that it is a real pleasure
to welcome a collection of tales by an author
who knows what he is writing about. “Steve
Brown’s Bunyip and other Stories” (Reming-
ton and Co., Limited), by J. A. Barry (“L.L.”),
is a book quite good enough to stand alone
without the introductory verses by Rudyard
Kipling. The Anglo-Indian story-teller has
written worse rhymes, certainly, but he has
also written ever so much better. Barry’s stories
are by sea and land, and, if there is a difference,
we incline to the sea tales. They are fully equal
in picturesque detail to anything of Clark
Russell’s, without the somewhat ostentatious
vulgarity which so often disfigures that author’s
works. Both in the land and sea tales there is,
what so few stories nowadays possess, the per-
vading feeling of locality ; the scenery, whether it
be in the township of Jillibegee, “frying in the
sun,” 650 miles north-west, or in the foc’sle of the
Sardanapalus, is not a mere word photograph but
a living picture. Moreover, Barry’s bushmen and
diggers are not cowboys or Californians masquerad-
ing in Australian dress, but such Australian types
as are to be found. We have not yet, it is true, had
time to develops any strikiijp national charac-
teristics, and herein the Australian author lies at
some disadvantage; but such books as “Steve
Brown’s Bunyip” will help to demolish the bas-
tard imitations of Bret Harte’s creations which
have been so long inflicted on the world as typical
Australian bushmen. The best and most finished
of the stories in this volume are the first and title
one, “Ex Sardanapalus,” “The Shanghai-ing of
Peter Barlow,” “ The Protection of the Sparrow-
hawk,” “Books at Barracaboo,” and a “Cape
Horn Christmas.” All the others are racy and
interesting, although the most ambitious one,
in point of length, appears to lack a connecting
link in the narrative. We are also in a position
to assure the reader that there are neither convicts
nor bushrangers in these stories. We quote the
best two verses out of Kipling’s introductory
poem ;
The irood wife’s sons come home again
Wi’ little in their hands
Rut the iear o’ men that ha’ dealt wi’ men
In the new and naked lands.
Rut the faith o’ men that ha’ proven men
Ry more than willing breath,
And the eyes o’ men that ha’ read wi’ men
In the open ho' ks o’ Death.
Stead quotes in the Review of Reviews
extracts from an able article by hia enemy, Dilke,
in the Quarterly, but suppresses Dilke’s name !
In a Melb. court a judge lately got quite
savage, because a workman witness said a married
man got less wages than a single one. “ How is

man, married the Due Decazes. Someone who

Pat O’Neil, a Hokitika milkman, was on 6
morning carrying round his cans when his doB
stuck up a Chinese vendor of “whi’ bai.” Th e
Chow fled, leaving the two kerosene-tins behind
him. Pat set down his milk-pails and ran to the
rescue. Seizing his opportunity, a rival milkman
meanwhile transferred a couple of pints of white
bait from the Chinaman’s tins into Pat’s, whose
next customer wanted to know how on earth the
fish had got into the milk. Pat, blushing to the
roots of his hair, stammered apologetically
“Well, bad luck to me, ma’am, if you’d ever believe
a fwhite bait could swhim up that creek.”
Victoria has reason to complain of the
invalidism of its judges. Justice Hodges has
been somewhat impaired in re Speight, and, in
the past, Stawell, Stephen, Webb, Williams and
Kerferd have struggled, at considerable public
disadvantage, to get through the work, landing
not so much themselves as the publio in heavy
expense, whereas such as Higinbotham, Moles-
worth and Holrsyd have never cost the tax-
payer an extra twopence beyond their salaries.
At latest advices Madden is not well. Now,
in England, it is coming into vogue to ap-
point youngish judges; even a brilliant man of
35, with 10 years’ practice, is fit for a judge-
ship, instead of waiting till he has used himself
up at the bar, and the judgery is a mere haven,
like that of the fat, lazy, old cock-schnapper, who
lies in his own peculiar hole at the bottom of Port
Jackson —pensioned on periwinkles and things.
Dear Bulletin, —The swagman is really
the bushworker’s worst enemy, as he is a constant
menace to a man’s security of tenure of his billet,
and enables employers to lower wages because the
employes fear that their billets will only too
readily be snapped up at any wages offered. T
would suggest to the Australian workers the
following remedies for the swagger. (1) Force
your Government to put such a tax on land as
will make it impossible for anyone to hold country
without working it. We are doing it here. (2)
No more strikes. A strike is a bad weapon that
shoots harder behind than it does in front. Votes
are the things, (3) Keep a cheque when you get
one. Close the swagger’s port of departure— the
lambing-down shanty. The man who habitually
knocks down his cheque is a slave of the worst
kind, and other workers have to compete with his
slave-labour. As John Burns says;—“At the
bottom of all labour troubles is the liquor
trouble.” —Yours, &c., Waipoie, Gisborne, M.L.,
Deo. 10, 1893. [John Burns’ statement is
specious, but not sound. The liquor trouble is
often at the top of labour troubles. Poverty
causes more drink than, or at least as much as,
drink causes poverty. Drunkenness is largely a
medical and hygienic question—a question too
vast to he dealt with in an epistolary footnote.—

A Vision of Youth.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
A horseman on a hill-top green
Drew rein, and wound his horn ;
So bright he looked he might have been
The Herald of the Morn.
His steed was of the sovran strain
In Fancy’s meadows bred—
And Pride was in his tossing mane,
And Triumph in his tread.
The rider’s eyes like jewels glowed—
The World was in his hand—
As down the woodland way he rode
When Spring was in the land.
From golden hour to golden hour
For him the woodland sang,
And from the heart of ev’ry flow’r
A singing fairy sprang.
He rode along with rein so free,
And, as he rode, the Blue
Mysterious Bird of Fantasy
Ever before him flew.
He rode by castle and by cot,
Through all the greenland gay ;
Bright eyes through casements glances shot—
He laughed—and rode away.
The whole wide world was all aflood
With light empyrean,
And through his throbbing veins the blood
In keen sweet shudders ran.
His steed tossed head with fiery scorn,
And stamped, and snuffed the air—•
As though he heard a sudden horn
Of far-off battle blare.
Erect the rider sat awhile
With flashing eyes, and then
Turned slowly, sighing, with a smile,
“ The weary world of men !”
But ah—but ah ! the Morning glowed,
The green trees beckoned him—
And deep, and deeper still, he rode
Into the Forest Dim.
That rider with his face aglow
With joy of life I see
In dreams. Ah, years and years ago
He parted ways with me 1
Yet sometimes, when the days are drear
And all the world forlorn,
From out the dim wood’s heart I hear
The echo of his horn.

THE TWO
GENUINE ARTICLES;
CLEMENTS TONIC,
FLETCHER’S PILLS,
IMITATED!
BUT UNRIVALLED
AND UNEQALLED.
CLEMENTS TONIC is a scientific chemical
food arid restores the tissue wasted by the voca-
tion of every day life, is a prompt and safe remedy
for neuralgia, nervousness, weakness, debility,
liver complaint, dropsy, and chronic indigestion.
FLETCHER’S PILLS cure heartburn, back-
ache, headache, liver torpidity, dyspepsia and all
complaints of the stomach and bowels.
These two remedies have been thoroughly tested
in all the hot countries of the world. They are
sold at a price within the reach of all people. Evi-
dence is forwarded free on receipt of name and
address that will satisfy the most sceptical as to
their virtues. They are sold everywhere, but care
must be taken that the genuine are obtained or
the money and time are wasted and the disease so
much the more serious.

It is said that a certain newspaper pro-
prietor was “pilled” at a leading 'Vic. oihbi at
the instigation of a railway magnate. Hence
several things.
The only survivors of the official party
which surveyed Adelaide city between Jan. and

A great N.S. W. statesman had an awkward

The imprint of S.A. Advertiser has been

The affronted Alex. Kethel, who at Sydney

A recent alleged portrait of Lobengula, in
a London illustrated paper, represents that fallen

The old law that precluded butehers from
being jurymen in murder cases, on the supposition
that their business gave them an unnatural thirst
for blood, ought to prevent any ex-butcher from
handling the prerogative of mercy.
Poor old Julius Vogel is reported to be
now very feeble. He is but the extinct cinder of
the meteoric Julius of former days. His engage-

Vizetelly, the London publisher, not long

Brittlebank, one of the seceders from
New Australia, ought to be badly missed, for he
appears to have struck the first distinctly bright
idea developed on the settlement. He wanted to
begin work by building a commodious asylum for
lunatics.
Judge Williams’ (Vic.) knighthood comes
as a sop for bis lost Chief-Justiceship. So a

penny rattle. Williams had a chance of showing
himself superior to Madden, but is content to be
his equal,
N.S.W. Premier Dibbs’ ambition in early
life was to be dictator of some South American
republic. He voyaged, fought and wore military
garments in that part of the world, and jokingly
remarked the other day that he “ had got there”
in his native land.
Captain Marling, who comes to N.S. W. to
drill the cavalry staff, served with Major-General
Hutton in the Soudan, This again demonstrates
that when Australia imports a high official of any
sort, it must expect, as part of the contract, to
take that official’s friends.
“Give me, as a leader-writer, a cleve r
disappointed man, of morbid mind, who wants to

Patchett Martin Says that a Melb. newspaper-
proprietor remarked this to him. One can spot

The latest Melb. Building Society secre-
tary awaiting trial in connection with a £12,000
affliction of the cash, faces the spikes with the
benefit of a good character. “He was a regular
attendant at church, and was connected with a
Sunday school at Hawthorn.”
Annie Besanb, who is to come here shortly,
and Australia’s recent visitor, Col. Olcott, a most
respectable-lcoking old gentleman who mostly
travels on his hair, are starting for Thibet to hunt
upMadame Blavatsky’s astral body. This isunder-
stood to hold Friday receptions in that region.
Sheriff Cowper (N.S.W.) knows a juror
who, in two hanging cases, discharged his duty
without a quiver, ordering the law to get “there”
on each occasion, and who, if empannelled on
larcenies or embezzlements, carries to the jury-
room a heart that bleeds copiously for the “un-
foitunate offender.”
From an Australian’s letter ;
Queen Victoria is simply a fat little, dumpy little, old
lit lie woman—that is, her predominant physical character-
istics are, first littleness, then fatness, (hen age. But she
does not iook old —on the contrary, well-preserved, with a
Ppod colour and firm flesh. I searched her face for in-
dicafons of expression but Cfu'd find none—simply a
well-bred emptiness of all expression whatever.
Miss Ah Ghee, of Tumut, N.S.W., 15
years old, got 93 per cent, of possible marks at a
London University music exam. She practises
the piano five hours daily—playing the Caucasian
out. The Gundagai paper congratulates “our
respected townsman, Mr. Ah Chee.” N.B.—
Mr. Ah Chee has a big ad. in the Gundagai paper.
Griffith, C.J. (Q.), is making a bad hash of
his law —in fact, people see more clearly every day
that he never was a really big lawyer, but only a
good legal critic. The puisne Judges, Harding
and Real, will never forget the legislative jobbery
which hoijjted him over their heads, and they are,
no doubt, delighted to sit on him at every oppor-
tunity.
Capt. Davies, of H.M.S. Royalist, has

The cricketing nuisance.
been C.M.G.’d for his services in carrying out the
annexation of the Gilbert Islands. A truly diffi-
cult undertaking! The gallant, acting under
instructions, took a party of men ashore, hoisted
the immortal flag, one supposes, and annexed the
group of islands by the solemn act of removing his
cocked cadey.
There are now in Sydney two knights
named William Manning. One is William
Montague Manning, ex-judge; the other, William
Patrick Manning, financier and mayor. It was
expected that the latter would use his second
name in connection with his title, just as Judge
Joseph George Long Innes, on his bebaublement,
suppressed the Joseph and adopted the George.
His Honor, by the way, is a good judge in more
than one sense, for that is an absolutely im-
mortal phrase : “ No offb named Joseph was ever
much of a success.”
Six members of Vic. Legislative Assembly
have died in the past year, and, as usual, Death
has a caprice on one letter, the last three being
B.’s—Burrowes, Bowman, Butterly.
When John M‘Kenzie, the bulky Maori-
la,nd Minister for Lands, came to Wellington after
his victory at Waihemo, Premier Seddon and a
crowd met him on the wharf, and it was
understood that there was to be a big demonstra-
tion. Then M‘Kenzie tramped heavily ashore,
and addressed his chief briefly with “ Halloa !”
and Seddon solemnly responded, “Halloa, John !”
That was all the ceremony.
Be the S.M. Herald cabled assertion
that Mr. Edwin Smith, K.C.M.G., of South
Australia, has been asked “by both political
parties” to stand for Wallsall (Eng.), this
altogether unprecedented demand for Edwin
Smith seems unaccountable, considering how very
little demand there ever was for him in his own
country. Apparently both parties feel that with-
out Smith they will be lost. Smith, however, has
declined, so they are lost.
James Park, a recently deceased director
of the Maoriland Shaw-Savill Co., left instruc-
tions—which were carefully carried out—that his
remains were to be cremated, and the vase con-
taining his dust was to be put aboard the first
vessel of his line sailing for Maoriland. When
the ship was off St. Catherine’s Head its bow was
to be turned exactly to the North, then the vase
was to be smashed against the ship’s side, and the
director’s ashes scattered to the winds and waves.
“ William Henry Neville Goschen, eldest
son of the Right Hon. G. J. Goschen, and private
secretary to Lord Jersey whilst Governor of
N.S. W,, was married on Nov. 23 to Miss Christian
Grant, of ‘House Hill,’ Nairn, N. 8., second
daughter of the late Colonel T. A. Grant, the
Archbishop of Canterbury officiating.”
To Jews, while angels praised his notion,
Jehovah gave a grant of Goshen ;
His priest to-day, while choir-hoys chant,
To Goschen gives a Christian Grant.
A well-known Southerner, interested in
Northern squatting properties, lately visited one
of his stations during the shearing, and was much
interested in the operation, which he had never
seen before. He stood watching one of the
shearers until he had finished a sheep and sent
it through the trap-door into the counting-pen.
Then the town squatter’s nationality peeped forth.
“ Vat!” said he, turning to the manager, who
was “over the board.” “do zey not take all ze
fur off ze feet!”
Arthur Bayley (of
Bayley’s Reward) was
engaged to a W.A. girl
prior to his huge slice
of luck, and married
shortly afterwards. He
and his wife left Melb.

two ago, after a two
months’ stay.
Of the 45 alleged
Australian statesmen
who, three years ago,
attended the Federal
Conference in Sydney,
ten are out of politics—
either dead, taken bil-
lets, bankrupt, or de-
feated at the polls.
A framed portrait
of the elder Parkes has
been exhibited for sale
in a Sydney pawnshop
window as an unre-
deemed pledge for the
last two years, and has
not yet found a pur-
chaser.
Byrnes, Q. Attor-
ney-General, came to
Sydney on New Year’s
Day, making holiday
with two sisters. Bris-
bane papers say a Go-
vernment steam-launch
is at his disposal. Des-
pite appearances,
Byrnes is a failure. He
started as a Democrat,
but the Q. Democracy
will never trust him
again. Once they be-
lieved in him ; now he
no longer believes in
himself. His is a plod-
ding, not a nimble
spirit, yet plodding
Edwin Lilley is passing
him at the Bar. He
succeeded to the bulk
of Real’s and Griffith’s
business when each as-
cended the Bench, but
in spite of Cabinet pres-
tige his practice does
not grow. After all,
does it pay to abandon
one’s ideals?
When Parkes is in a very tight place he
always says he “ stands in the light of the grave ”
—just as when a certain well-known Sydney
capitalist, or ex-capitalist, is in a tight place, he
invariably blows his nose in a bandanna and
winks wickedly. At Bathurst, last week, Parkes
pathetically said he did not calculate upon visiting
the city again.
“Tiger Inglis,” M.L.A., chairman of
Sydney Chamber of Commerce and ex-Minister
of Public Instruction, N.S.W., who proceeds to
England after a series of “ send-offs,” will be in
London when’his new book of Scotch stories, now
in press, is issued. Tiger’s broad-Scotch stories
are all good, and no one in Australia can tell
Scotch stories as well as he, but he isn’t telling
any Scotch broad stories in the book, nor is he
addicted to these in the measure which might be
expected of a parson’s son.
Charles E. Hern, once of Sydney, lias
just died in England, where he had a most
fashionable clientele as an art-instructor, his pupils
including the daughters of the Prince of Wales,
He was as microscopic and laborious in his art as
is theN.S.W. Attorney-General in his law. “My
microscopic friend, Mr. Heydon,” the other day
said Rogers, Q.O.
Judge Williams (Vic.), the half-and-half
sort of Radical, was partly seduced into accepting
a knighthood by the name he acquired at baptism.
Sir Hartley Williams! Who could resist the
charm of being addressed as “Sir Hartley?”
Reminds one of Sir Hartley Courtly. The Judge

Knights never ride such things.
FRANCES KNORR (baby-farmer, to be banged at Mel
bourne on 15th inst. for child-murder, and to avoid the
disgrace of butchering whom the Victorian hangman,
“Jones,” cut his throat last week).
Now that ex-Premier Jas. M‘Culloch is
gone, there is no barm in saying what has often
been hinted, that his marriage to Miss Inglis was
the sole cause of his political apostacy. The lady
was brought, or sent, from Scotland, Mac. being
then a widower of long duration. From the date
of his wedding he began to slant away Too-
rakianly, N.N.W., a little Southerly.
Thomas Jones, drowned in the Mitchell
River (Vic.) floods on Boxing Day, was, when a
lad, transported to Tasmania for high treason.
He was a chimney-sweep, and his master had the
Windsor Castle contract. For a joke, when the
Queen was married to Prince Albert, young Jones
crept down a flue and hid beneath the nuptial
bed. Fortunately, Victoria is a real woman, and
so before retiring she looked under the bed in the
fashion of women from time immemorial. When
she saw the young sweep, she screamed “Murder!”
A posse of lackeys ran in, and exit Mr. Jones to
Tasmania.
When Mrs. Yates, the lady Mayor (not
Mayoress) of Onehunga (M.L.), took office, the
retiring Mayor complimented her on her elevation
and hoped that she would remember the words on
the back of the Mayor’s chair ; “Be just and fear
not.” The lady retorted that she had done that
all her life, and it would be well if everybody else
could say the same. The town-clerk and the fire-
brigade have resigned, the latter sarcastically
suggesting that a female fire-brigade be formed to
match the Mayor; but Mrs. Yates “takes no
notice.” She says she is the first lady Mayor in
the British Empire, and the eyes of the civilised
world are upon her.
Bertrand, the slayer of Mr. Kinder,
whom it is sought to release from prison, where he
has been for the, in these days, unprecedented
term of a quarter of a century, was a cold-blooded,
deliberate murderer, and deserves to be kept in
gaol till he dies. Were be kept in prison until the
very end it would show that such a thing as life-
imprisonment is possible, and that there is an
effective alternative to the gallows. But, as urged
by A. G. Taylor, all men are equal before the law,
and Bertrand should be treated as other mur-
derers are treated. The private vengeance of
powerful officials should be no factor in determin-
ing the fate of even the most ruffianly criminal.

“Three-fourths of the Victorians whe

Were York and May to visit Australia next
year every “colonial” Govt, would loyally end
up with a big deficit to show how much less they
thought of money than of Royalty.
Never during the 12
years of his presidentship
of S.A. Legislative Council
did Henry Ayers vote ex-
cept when the numbers
were equal. Chaffey Baker,
during the four days he
filled the post before last
session closed, voted re-
peatedly in committee agai,

inclined to double the charac-
ters of President and Leader
of the Opposition.
“ Let there be rto com-

silver at the ratio of
16 to 1, Pay back

thesame ratio.”—
Denver Road.
Parkes says that
the Dibbs Cabinet
induced Gov. Duff
to prorogue Parlia-
ment “for no
other purpose than
to save their
scurvy skins for a
month.” Parkes’
skin-disease figures of speech are not nice, and
the envious, enraged old man seems to get
dirtier in his eloquence as he grows older.
The “ New Australia ” flag bears an orange
with leaf and blossom, the Paraguayan Jack being
in the corner. A good emblem for a matrimonial-

It is asserted that an Adelaide daily lately
got an accession of capital from a National Ass
magnate, who has since been a familiar figure in
its offices.
As there are 3500 publicans in N.S. Wales,
compensation for loss of licenses would, at the
Geelong rate under the Victorian Act, come to

E. W. O’Sullivan, M.L.A., and member

“No one,” now says G. H. Reid, “will

And,-’ says .dSsop, “he pleased nobody and

“ Why don’t you read more and whine less

accounted for. Ignorance at the ballot-box is
what brought you hard times.”—Ex.
The luck of Toby Barton, Q.C. (N.S.W.),
has followed him since his bright schoolboy and
matriculation and college days. He quarrelled
with the Dibbs crowd just in time to escape being 1
branded with a British flunkey-mark. Watch
n "'v 866 ( l° esn ’* i l' ve to make capital out
of the fact that he remains a common Mister.
“ Here,” said a democratic N.S.W. legis-
lator in a restaurant, the other day, “is an illus-
tration of the Bicameral system. That’s the
Assembly, or legislation hob and he held up his
cn P tea; “and that,” he continued, as he
poured the liquid into a saucer and ladled it with
a spoon, “ is the Council, or legislation cold.”
Why don’t N.S.W. members who are
always ready to trot round departments and move
adjournments of the House to “find out things,”
once in a lifetime extract a clear official statement
as to why State-school pupil teachers, whose
salaries are compulsorily docked four per cent,
during the five years of their service, are refused
a refund if they resign at the end of that term?
President Carnot, it is cabled, says the
most cherisiied wish of France is the world’s peace,
xet one of the things that strikes a stranger most

public Works Department (Vic.) has
decided to insist that all stone used for concrete

The only really independent member of
S.A. Legislature is George Ash. All the rest are
swayed from side to side by party considerations,
but he follows his nose, and owns allegiance to no
leader.
Premier Kingston’s enemies sneeringly
assert that he is only fitted to be President of a
South American Republic. After all, the best
work is often done by a Democracy led by an
autocrat.
Q. Attorney-General Byrnes told Sydney
Star that he was returned for Cairns (Q.) elector-
ate on the anti-Separation ticket. He forgot to
say that until the last moment people were hood-
winked into thinking him a Separationist.
When Premier Seddon made his triumphal
entry into Masterton (M.L.) the other day, a
brass band met him at the station, and, with a
horrible sense of the unfitness of things struck up
the_ joyous tune, “Good old Mother has come
again to Prophesy.”

“It was

—if he has any friends—should muzzle him for a
month. Otherwise, he may burst.
Poet Tom Bracken failed to secure a seal
in the Maoriland Parliament.
Attorney-General Byrnes says Queensland
is to have a surplus, too, next June. He does not
explain that, in Queensland, surpluses are ob-
tained by the simple means of placing the pro-
ceeds of Treasury bills to revenue account.
£oo,ooo was so appropriated last year.
Maoriland correspondent of the Age pro-
phesies that Stout’s popularity will force Seddon
to retire from the M.L. Premiership; in which
case he has four big billets open to him : those of
Chief Commissioner of Railways, .£1250 ; Speaker,
Agent-General, Auditor-General, £lOOO a year.
Very few wealthy men now remain either
in S.A, Council or Assembly. In the former
body Angas, Simpson and Diincan are the only
plutocrats, while in the people’s- Chamber the
moneyed members are the Hawkers, father and
son, and George Riddoch. All the rest have to
work pretty hard for a living.
The N.S.W. Freetrade flute is lipped dis-
ingenuously both by Reid and the S.M. Herald.
Reid plays land-tax, not because he likes it, bub
to capture a block vote; and the Herald plays
Civil Service retrenchment, not because it likes
that, but to dish the need for land-tax, Reid
warbles to charm Georgeites, the Herald to please
land-owners ; while Freetrade herself stands
robbed of her flute.
A writer in Ipswich (Q.) Times ;
“If I had Barton’s intellect,” said Dibbs to me once,
“ I could rule N.S. Wales at my own sweet will.”
These “ ifs ” ! But hear Barton !
Barton once said to me, “Do they want me to throw
my trousers round my neck and rush about the town
crying, ‘ Democracy I Democracy !’ ”
The judicial decision which, in the Hard
Cash case, sends Rosa and his associates for
sentence, determines the principle of one of the
points set down for argument in the lately-settled
action of N.S.W, Ministry v. Sydney Daily
Telegraph— viz., that a collection of persons
acting as one body may sue for libel. The legal
maxim that a corporation has no soul originated
with Coke, and has been a fountain of error since
his time.
Prominent Sydney politicians are now
regularly stuck up by persons who want a loan for
having called “the opponent who ran you down
at his last meeting a liar.” “You can see it in
the paper,” vouched one of these ; “ I called it to
his face and broke up the meeting.” Last week a
politician was interviewed by a hard-jawed
Stentor who for 15s. was prepared to promise
that he would not interrupt the politician in his
next harangue.
The Referendum, owing to the defeat of
Eugene J. O’Conor, who introduced it last
session, may not be carried during the present
Maoriland Parliament. O’Conor, otherwise
known as “The Bnller Lion,” for which sobriquet
he is indebted to Thatcher, had made a special
study of the Referendum, and had set his
heart on attaining it. A few years ago
he visited Switzerland, for the express pur-
pose of seeing how it worked there. The
Referendum would have stood a good chance
of passing last session, had not both Govern-
ment and Opposition whips done their best to
defeat it. A few weeks afterwards the Opposition
leader stated on the hustings that he was in favour
of it! Another instance of the absurdity of
Party Government: each side wants to have the
credit of passing a measure that is likely to be
popular, and neither one will let the other do it;
and when a private member tries to get it done
both sides “ jump on ” him.
Max Hirsch, the

jandrum, should be

The unemployed

N.S.W. Gov. Duff has cabled 'Orae that
the prospect of a visit from York and May is
hailed with gratification by the community of
this loyal colony. ” The Bulletin has been going
round with a lantern looking for that “gratifi-
cation,” but unless ic is expressed by the jeers of
three-fourths of the press and ninety-nine hun-
dredths of the voters, it isn’t very apparent.
Therefore, this paper hereby calls on Mr, Duff,
as a man wlte tries to keep as near the truth as
his insidious billot will allow, to produco some
solid evidence of the public jubilation.
The fact that a N.S.W. ratepayer in
arrears with rates goes bankrupt, does nob, accord-
ing to. Justice Stephen, bar the municipal council
from suing him for the amount due, the reason
appearing to be that the debt to the council has a
statutory foundation, and is thus outside the
jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court. If borough
councils generally choose to act on this decision, a
host of schedule filers of the last few years will
have a lively time.
The interprovincial conference of Labour
members will shortly take place in Sydney. The
principal work of the meeting will be to draw up
a platform of concerted action. In the process
the cast-iron regulations framed in Sydney
recently by the Labour-party-outside-Parliament
will come in for rough handling. On this account
Brisbane Worker opposes the conference and
threatens any Q. Labour member who dares take
part; but Queensland is to be represented all the
same.
Attorney-General Byrnes impudently says
that N.Q. Separation is dead. On the contrary,
it is only just born. The Railway Commissioners
have taken away one argument in its favour by
reducing rates on Northern lines to the scale
charged in the South, but, as long as Brisbane is
Brisbane, the other seventeen thousand reasons
will remain. This much is certain, that the British
authorities are convinced of the justice of the
demand, and only wait a conclusive plebiscite to
take action. The bias of the Southern Parliament
is thoroughly recognised, and its interested pro-
tests will go for nothing.
Military matters are mixed in Queensland.
Major-General Owen is chief of the forces, and
Lieut.-Colonel Thynne is, therefore, his subordin-
ate. But Thynne is also a member of the Cabinet,
and in that capacity he is Owen’s superior.
Therefore he can sit on the General in one capa-
city, and the General can sit on him in another.
Lately the capacities have got mixed up a good
deal through Thy»ne making a military appoint-
ment which the General promptly annulled, and
it looks as if things might end in Owen putting
the Minister under arrest, or else being sacked
himself by his own underling.
Premier Patterson’s day is surely over.
Instead of combining Agent - Generalcy with
General-Agency in the interests of economy he
appoints Duncan Gillies in the former and retains
Dr. Pearson in the latter capacity. Then, while a
few miserable village settlers are kept without
their progress - payments for improvements
effected on the holidays, on the excuse of lack of
funds, he brazenly invites Royalty to visit Vic-
toria at an expense which would more than cover
the cost of solving the present unemployed crisis.
Even the Mayor of his own district is compelled
to denounce him.
The new W.A. Constitution Bill professes
to give manhood suffrage for Assembly elections,
qualified by twelve months’ residence in the pro-
vince and six months in one district. However,
the method of application is greatly hampered,
and the matter of naturalisation of aliens is
grievously explicit. But Property can have 40
votes —there is no trouble at all about that. For
the Legislative Council, there are property quali-
fications. One of these is the simple appearance
of the_ voter’s name on the ratepayers’ roll of a
municipality or a roads board. Which gives Pro-
perty a chance to choke up the electoral-roll for
the Council with ; id or friendly dummies.
Robt. Reid’s important
mission has lost the
second of its three pre-
tences—ere Mr. Reid
has been three weeks at
sea. His avowed busi-
ness in London disap-
peared with the appoint-
ment as Agent-General
of Duncan Gillies. His
Irgent task of advising
the Vie. Government
about American rail-
way experts is another
exploded fiction. The
Government has dis-
covered that there is
not .and never was a
proposal to engage an
American expert.
“ Dibbs, the Brum-
magem Dictator,” says
G. H. Reid. Thus art-
fully does Reid get at
his real rival, Parkes,
of Brummagem.
The cable reports that a French and
a British detachment have met in the dark some-
where in Sierra Leone, and mistaking each other
for an enemy they proceeded to have a breezy and
inspiriting fight. According to the British cable
the French were a trifle over two to one, and
were licked notwithstanding. How the British
cablegrammer counted them in the dark and the
general confusion isn’t explained, but it is one of
the fixed traditions of England that the English
always are fighting against heavy odds. It is 300
years since the time of the Armada, and the fact
that the Spanish fleet was the smaller of the two
in that historic ocean scrum hasn’t yet soaked
into the English comprehension. As for the fact
that the Russians were badly outnumbered at the
Alma, it hasn’t even begun to be dimly compre-
hended and isn’t likely to be this century.

Gold discoveries. Very rich fields have
been opened at Southern Cross, Coolgardie, Mur-
chison, &c., in West Australia, which will be one
of the greatest gold-producing countries of the
world. Land in Perth and Albany, the principal
cities, is ridiculously low in price, and must cer-
tainly increase very much in value in the next
few years. One of the best investments at present
time is to secure a few lots. The Intercolonial
Investment Co., Ltd., 309 Pitt-street, Sydney,
offers exceptionally well-positioned blocks from
-filO each on very easy terms, or for cash,
guaranteed title. The company has been estab-
lished in Sydney and Perth for many years, and
is well-known throughout the colonies for straight
dealing. The manager is Mr. W. J. Douglas,
v> ho will he pleased to forward plans to any
address, and, having a personal knowledge of the
properties, will select faithfully for intending
purchasers where required.

Melbournian : “ This is the queerest city
under the sun. Last Sunday night, I was stuck
up by a not penniless bushman for a fill of
tobacco, inasmuch as, near a whole cityfull, he
could get none for love or money. Near by was a
fruitshop, wide open, where I got a bottle of
lemonade. Thence I went to the Gaiety theatre,
where Will Stevens was singing a comic song to
a waltz-tune, by the band, while the collection
was being taken up in hats. The churchwardens
gave change. Will Bishop Goe try to persuade
me this was more sacred than decently taking the
money at a pay-box ? Next I visited the Rotunda
cincert, where the collection is taken at a turn-
stile, on the principle of no compulsion, but you
must. How long ere the humbug is burst up ?”

Archdeacon Farr, one of the most ancient
of Adelaide clergymen, on Boxing Day married
two couples and buried Col. Finniss and a little

Capt. Henniker, the popular bachelor
private secretary of the S. A. Lieut.-Governor, has

he will return from England, even should Kintore

the godson of Albert Edward, after whom he is
named.

The municipal sales of lost dogs were held
in Melb. Corporation Baths on Xmas Eve
last year. A reserve of one shilling is laid on each
animal; those not purchased are thrown into an
iron cage which is submerged in water later on.
NO FALSE PRIDE.
LUGGINS (ironically, to Boozer who is waiting fora shout): “ I supposeit’s
no good asking you to join us in a drink?”
BOOZER: “Oh, I don’t mind. I ain’t particular. I’d drink with a
blanky blackfellow.”
A big Newfoundland would be led forward and
immediately snapped up. Then a roguish-looking
little mongrel would face the audience wagging
his tail as if to say, “Do buy me, somebody !”
but it would be no go and off he would be dragged
to his happy Xmas. The skins of the slaughtered
are not used—the animals are buried intact.
, The silly-season discussion for this year in
Melb. Argus is on the Australian accent as dis-
covered by Chief Justice Madden. It is rather
amusing to see J. L. Purves picked out by one of
the correspondents to the controversy as the model
speaker. Purves has a decided Australian accent,
as a matter of fact. He invariably says “ slistor”
for “solicitor,” and “ t waive” for “twelve.”
When all is said and done, it is merely a matter
of prevailing custom that determines the correct
enunciation of the language.
Even Bishop Moorhouse, whom most people
here considered a perfect Chrysostom in voice and
eloquence, is said by those “in the know ” to lack
the final polish of “ English culture,” and ex-Gov.
Loch positively gabbles. So it is not only we
poor “colonials” who sin against correct speech.
The Honolulu natives, who draw their “ English”
from the pure well of ’Frisco water-front, mimic
and laugh at the “British accent ”of the mail-
steamer tourists. Where our national twang
comes out particularly strong, however, is not in
talking, but in singing. Even in some churches
you could out the accent of the choir with a knife—
when, for instance, they request the congregation
“To tyste and see how grycious the Lord is.”
After all, the nasal twang of the Australians is
not a bit worse English than the awf’ly-jolly
don’t-yer-know drawl of the London Johnnie.
Anyone could, even on the day upon which
applications were first invited, have shut his eyes
and laid an infallible finger upon the duly-qualified
gentleman whom Providence had designed to fill
the recently-created position of second-assistant
honorary ophthalmic surgeon at Sydney Hospital.

A back-blocks N.S.W. lady writes The

requisitioning her (so to speak) professional ser-
vices. The climax came a few days since, when a
deputation of his countrymen rushed into her
house with a particularly filthy Chinaman, par-
tially undressed him on the sofa, and loudly
demanded suction for his elbow. Just here the
lady writes for advice; and, as far as we can

In Maoriland, when anybody developes
into an incurable drunk, the law issues a prohibi-
tion order, and thereafter any publican supplying
him with drink incurs heavy penalties. The
other day, at Auckland, a serious old teetotal lady
applied for a prohibition order against herself.
Being asked if she was an incurable drinker, she
indignantly replied that she never tasted liquor
in any form, and only wanted the order issued
“on principle ” and as a good example to others.
The order was issued accordingly, and when she
found that her name would be duly posted up in
all hotels with the dipsomaniacs and the obscene

Dunedin (M.L.) has started a Social
Reform Association on the good old Social
Gimlet principle. Members of the Association
are to go round stealthily and hold their breath
while they listen with a large, holy ear at other
people’s keyholes, and are to look with a sanctified
eye through cracks in the weatherboards. A
special watch is to be kept—from the highest
motives—upon bedroom windows —especially the
windows of ladies’ bedrooms—where the blind
has been left up by accident; and any man out
walking after dark with a woman is to be tracked
and (if not too large) admonished.

GALTON’S BOOK.
The intellectual life of Mr. Oalton. private secretary to
N.S.W. Governor Duff, has been (solemnly writes J.
Tighe Ryan in a wondronsly funny Sydney D.T. article)
somewhat romantic. There is a story in' circulation to
the effect that when he was waltzing in a ballroom last
season it was noticed that he had something bulky inside
his vest. The mystery, which was the occasion of much
gossip, was understood later on when the private secre-
tary was seen in a quiet corner of the room reading a
Greek Homer.
Gallon, hero of the life romantic,
Dancers in a ball-room once drove frantic,
Not with airs, or intellectual “jam,”
But with a swelling ’neath his diaphragm.
But our Gallon nimbly cut his capers,
Heedless of the crowd of Potts’ Point drapers,
Thinking only of Achilles’ foes,
Or of ancient father Priam’s woes.
Soon, unseen, a quiet corner finds him,
Reading Homer’s Greek where no one minds him,
While his vest, deliver’d of the book,
Smooth, no more can draw the curious look.
Whisper, Gallon unsophisticated,
Poetry and ball-rooms are not mated,
Next time leave your Homer on the shelf,
That, good youth, or stay at home yourself!

lady’s apartment on the ground-floor of a sus-
pected house. Unfortunately, a male inmate
spotted him from another window as he stood
with his face against the glass, and gently stepping
into the lady’s room fired a dinner-plate at him
through the window. The broken glass and the
remains of the plate were extracted from his
countenance by the nearest surgeon, but his nose
was knocked permanently sideways, and he has
never since been the same fascinating saint.

The official report of the aboriginal camp
at Boggabilla, near Narrabri, N.S.W., presented
a few days ago to the Aborigines Protection Board,
sitting in Folice-luspector-Ceneral Fosbery’s Syd-

on the increase, and gambling rampant at the
camp,” and the minutes of the meeting record
that the Board unanimously resolved that the
report was “satisfactory.”

Melb. W. T. C. U. is making things quite easy
for the Almighty. Through its instrumentality 7
persons were fined at Richmond the other day for
selling pennyworths of lollies and fruit on the
Lord’s day. The youthful customers in each case
had embezzled coppers meant for the heathen.
A pity the law concerns itself with the petty
jealousies of these rival business concerns.

Sydney and its suburbs are now infested
with the man of the soundless footfall. He who
overtakes or abruptly confronts you, coming out
of the dark without a premonitory sound of heel
or toe, is an assailant in method. A police regu-
lation prohibits the use of noiseless boots by the
force, although, in many cases, constables might
turn such footgear to public advantage; and the
reason which supports the regulation would
justify making the wearing of such boots by others
an offence.

Australian Star, reprobating the Yic.
women’s petition for the commutation of the
death-sentence on Frances Knorr, says :
It is curious that the crime of child-murder, to judge
by this document, as well as by the sex of those who
generally commit this crime, is regarded much more
lightly by women than by men. Yet, surely, it should be
otherwise.
This is another allusion to the maternity senti-
ment; but the graver point is that the Star
implies that women, if they differ from men on
this matter, do so without cause. Child-murder
is, however, very often the human consequence of
man’s iniquity ; the woman-culprit is tried in a
court presided over by a man, is prosecuted by
men, and judged by men alone. Does not all this,
and more, constitute a prima facie reason for
womanly interference between the sentence and
its fulfilment ?

Butcher Patterson wanted Australia to
hurry up with the Duke of York’s invitation,
because otherwise “his programme would pro-

Duchess’s programme also seems to be full just
now.
According to cable :
The Queen, the Prince of Wales, and doctors attending
members of the Royal Family, are being consulted with
respect to the accouchement of the Duchess of York.
There is always an accouchement impending, or
on hand, or justoverin the Guelph family, and the
plain, animal, Sairey Gamp aspect of the matter
is ever kept distressingly to the front.

Melbourne is infested by housebreakers,
ir shopbreakers, whose chief ambition is to burgle
beer and tobacco. No private citizen possessed
Df much portable property thinks of going to bed
before he has placed a dozen of ale and a box of
figara on the dining-room table. That anchors
the ruffians to the one apartment, until they
eventually stagger off too drunk to carry away
more than is inside them.
A New Year’s gift from Ipswich Times :
Tim Bulletin is owned by and intended for yahoos. It
is a paper from which every cultured man shrinks. After
picking it up by accident one insensibly calls for soap and
water.
It is generally believed in Germany that
the Emperor’s real object in making advances to
Prince Bismarck is to induce the ex-chancellor to
give up a number of indiscreet letters which he
wrote to him during the illness of the Emperor
Frederick.
Cabled that Stead’s new daily paper pro-
ject is a failure. The arrangement was for 100,000
people to_ plank =£l 6s. each—and start the
journal with Stead as absolutely irresponsible
boss. If it succeeded, he could buy the share-
holders out by degrees, and make the paper his
own. But “General” Booth has been taking
heavy crops out of the ground lately, and the
fools were not forthcoming. So Stead is back to
“Julia” for consolation.
Young Emperor William, of Germany,
has been referring once more to the inspired career
of old William, his grandfather, hinting, too,
that God has still a warm regard for their dynasty.
“How wonderfully Providence led him!” says
young William. His hoary ancestor was more
modest. He inclined to the belief that Providence
directed the German Army in person—
By grace divine, my dear Augusta,
We’ve had another awful buster ;
Ten thousand Frenchmen sent below—
Praise God from whom all blessings flow 1
The Alert, which sank outside Port Philip
Heads the other day, was on one occasion at least
m danger of being swamped by a moderately
rough sea during the holiday journey from Geelong
to Melbourne. The present writer remembers
saying to one of the crew that the boat, heavily
loaded at the time, required very little more sea
to bring it to grief, although just then there was
“UNDER THE WATTLE.”
(Verses borrowed by “ The Bulletin" from “ The Kangaroo.")

merely a heavy swell on. The man replied that
on the previous Saturday, when a large football
crowd were returning from a match at Geelong,
he “ really ■ thought it was a case.” The Alert
never seemed a safe boat in a cautious landsman’s
eyes, but she had negotiated the voyage out from
England, and people who pretended to understand
sea-craft declared that her little eccentricities
denoted strength of character.
Since 1860 (33 years) the American con-
gress has appropriated to rail-roads Government
land to the amount of 3,000,000,000 acres. Much
of this land is valuable, and was valuable when
given to railroads. Put the 3,000,000,000 acres at
$5 per acre, and we have the sum of $15,000,000,000,
which would more than pay for all the railroads
in the United States, watered stock and all; while
the actual cost of the roads has not been above
$7,000,000,000 or $8,000,000,000, the stock has
been watered to perhaps $15,000,000,000. Now
give the man thunder who says we cannot buy
the roads.—Progressive Farmer.
Jabez Spencer Balfour, the British holy
man who ran away with the millions of the
Liberator Society, doesn’t seem to be having a
good time in Argentina. He lives in a gorgeous
mansion, and a cold sweat of terror, at Lamos de
Zomora, 25 miles from Buenos Ayres, and his
short, circular figure is never seen outside the
front door of the premises except under a strong
guard. The house is constantly watched by over
100 police and soldiers, and Jabez’s hard-stolen
money is fast melting away in paying for these
elaborate defences. Very soon, as things go, he
will be a short, wheezy, red-nosed beggar in the
streets of Buenos Ayres, and his present satellites
will run him in for vagrancy and having no p’ace
to sleep. Then, if the British Government wants
him it can lure him on board ship by holding up
a sixpence or a fried chop, and crooking its finger
at him.

Let ex-Treasurer M‘Millan beware ! East
Sydney electors won’t stand abuse. At the

dependent and co-ordinate entities.”
Prendergast, murderer of Chicago’s Mayor,
was a devoted admirer of Henry George—swal-
lowed_ his theories, gulped his fancies, guzzled his
fallacies. He was a decent fellow, they say, with
only the one soft spot. But such a soft spot!
Poor Prendergast—that is, poor Harrison—we
mean, poor George !
Millionaire Tyson :
The men of central Australia will be among the picked
men of the world, physically and mentally ; the horses
will be the fleetest and most enduring; the cattle and
sheep will yield the most tender, succulent and tooth-
some meat. England is a manure heap whose soil is
poisoned by the animal droppings of centuries, and whose
vegetation is less wholesome for stock than the health-
giving natb e grasses of inland Australia, with pastures
renovated by hush fires and purified by a tropical sun.
Tyson is right enough. England is “worked
over and over with sour, dead and distempered
corpses.” Under her soil are the foul liquid and
meat of the drunkards and gluttons of countless
generations. Her best fruit suggests the putres-
cence it springs from. The lush, rich grass- the
stock rolling fat-hearty John Bull himself,
coarse, full of blood, bull-necked, apoplectic-all
are ripe with an unhealthy rankness. Looking a*
an English girl—clean, sane, and lusciofis—one
involuntarily says with Walt Whitman: “Now
I am terrified at the Earth ! it is that calm and
patient. It grows such sweet things out of such
corruptions.”
Editor Bulletin,— Re “The Ophir of
Charles de Breuil ” in your issue of 23rd Dec. Hero
is a clipping from a London daily of several years
ago
M. Baudoin, a doctor who went out to New Ireland
with one of the expeditions organised by M. de Breuil
better known as the Marquis des Rays, now awaiting his
trial on some grave charges, gives some very interesting
details as to the manner in which Maragnane, the native
King, signed the treaty presented by Captain Rabardy.
His Majesty was invited on board the Genii, and appeared
on the quarter-deck in the full, but not complete, costume
of a band of red cloth round his arm and a reed through his
nose. He was accommodated with a seat on a hencoop, and
wasplaced within a tempting distance of a scarlet petticoat,
a bunch of clay pipes, a quantity of tobacco, and some
beads. His intention was so taken up by the munificence
of Rabardy that he took little or no notice of the hens
which pecked irreverently at his sable legs every now and
again. He was asked if the island belonged to him, and
answered in the affirmative, making for the presents. He
was forced back into his seat, while the lawyer who
accompanied the expedition read over the charter by
which the white man had everything given to him. He
was told he could have the presents if he signed the docu-
ment. With tears in his eyes, he urged his ignorance of
the art of caligraphy, a:«l the lawyer guided his hand,
showing him to make a cross. His courtiers who had
accompanied him looked on with surprise. When they
saw that making a mark with a pen placed their monarch
in possession of so many rich gifts, they came forward
with touching unanimity, and Captain Rabardy had some
difficulty in preventing them from covering the deed with
crosses.
SARDONYX.
“In proportion as a man is an artist, he
will not be a critic*.”
Judge Williams, in response to the con-
gratulations of the Melbourne Bar on his receipt of
an Imperial tag : “ I feel honoured by the dis-
tinction conferred upon me by the Queen and
regard it as a recognition of any small service I
may have rendered the State in the high and
responsible office I hold.” The Judge, in wearing
the Imperial bauble, advertises his opinion that
the people he serves for a fat salary are not in a
position to adequately reward him for his services.
A democracy cannot afford to keep this class of
servant, and it doesn’t when it knows itself.
Dear Bulletin, —For 25 consecutive years,
it seems, a N.S.W. Governor had not failed to
turn up at the Sydney Caledonian Society’s
dinner, from which fact it is assumed by a
vociferous mob of transplanted Scotchmen that
their compatriot, Duff, disregarded a solemn duty
when he kept away from that heavy, clannish
feed. In truth, a Governor, presuming him to
have any business anywhere in these parts, has no
business at the assertive racial demonstration in
question. Neither ought he to attend a Celtic
national gorge, or a Welsh-rabbit supper, or half-
a-dozen other festivals whereat the chairman
“ blows ” concerning the superiority of his native
heath, ould sod, or mountain ranges for human
breeding purposes. You are frequently severe,
upon_ England, but you must at least admit that
Englishmen in Australia, or anywhere else, don’t
form themselves into a party for purposes of
defence and offence against their neighbours. As
for the Caledonians of Sydney, they have publicly
asserted a commanding claim upon vice-regality.
Scotchmen are always to be specially glorified
through bis Excellency, the Governor. Please
make a note of this and oblige a— British
Radical.
Newcastle, N.S.W., supplies a grim
domestic tragedy. Mrs. Hyde, a resident of
Young Wallsend (a deserted mining township
outside Newcastle), had a husband of unexampled
brutality, whose bestial cruelty made her life
almost insupportable. She repeatedly sought the
protection of the law against him, and, though
after having him imprisoned twice, she obtained a
legal separation, he frequently forced his way
into her residence and inhumanly assaulted her.
At last local Quarter Sessions he was tried for an
unmentionable offence upon her, and though the
medical evidence thoroughly confirmed hers, he
was discharged. Emboldened by this escape, he
repeated his acts of swinish cruelty. About a
fortnight ago he accidentally met her in the lonely
bush near Wallsend, and, after maltreating her
for four hours in the pouring rain, left her, bruised,
helpless and unable to walk, by the side of the
railway, where some hours after she was
discovered by two of her young children.
A few nights ago he came to her house drunk,
slept for a few hours, then arose and began to
drag her round the floor by the hair. The un-
fortunate woman, driven to desperation by this
and other cruel indignities, shot him through the
temple with a revolver which she had purchased
to protect herself after her last ineffectual appeal
for justice. She then surrendered herself to the
police, first sending for a medical man to treat
her still living husband, who died a few hours
after. The greatest sympathy is felt for the un-
fortunate woman, who was respected for her
brave attempts to rear her family by continuous
hard work, and pitied for the terrible suffering
she was compelled to undergo at her husband's
hands. It is said by the neighbours that some of
the acts he subjected her to were incredible in
their devilish ingenuity. At the inquest which
followed the jury brought in a verdict of justifiable
homicide in defence of life and the woman was
accordingly discharged from custody.
MY PHILOSOPHY.
Whether it’s sickness, troubles,
Or fortune’s reverse,
I think of poor others, and —
“ Well, it might have been worse.”
HENRY ANDERSON.
PETITION TO THE SECRETARY OF
STATE.
Recall this canny, kilted chiel,
Recall him hame by cable—
He spurned a tasty Scottish meal
Wi’ Scotties at the table.
The Lord preserve our native heath !
And Heaven bless its heather,
And grant that proud Sir Robert’s teeth
May drop out altogether !
No mongrel Sassenach rebuff
Would trouble Mac or Archie,
But deevil tak the doughty Duff
Who treats his brithers starchy.
Our fathers fought at Prestonpans,
They also bled wi’ Wally,
And insults to our Hieland clans
We oanna’ stand, by golly !
Then drag him fra’ his billet braw;
A chieftain o’ his kidney,
According to our Scottish law,
Is no the mon for Sydney.
We wadna’ wish to see him dee
Of patriotic vi’lence,
But when he cuts his lucky we
Will cheer in solemn silence.

“GRATEFUL RESULTS”
Mrs. Lydia M. Tarbox, of Altoona,
Pennyslvania, U. S. A.
A Life of Suffering and Misery, without
Sleep, without Appetite, with Bowels al-
ways Out of Order.
Restored to Health by the use of
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla
" Last Spring. I was grievously afflicted
with Biliousness and liver Complaint. My
mouth was in a terrible condition every morn-
ing, my tongue thickly coated, my breath was
offensive ; food distressed me, I suffered much
from headache, my skin was sallow, and my
bowels were always out of order. Sleep did
not refresh me, nor did the many remedies,
recommended do me any good. At last I com-
menced using Ayer’s Sarsaparilla, and my im-
provement began almost from the first dose. It
relieved the distress about my liver, regulated
my bowels, caused food to set well on my stomach,
cured mv headache, improved my complexion,
and restored my appetite. These unlooked for,
but grateful, results were accomplished by only
two and a half bottles of Ayer’s Sarsaparilla.”—

Poor little Dr. Renwick, of Sydney, has,
it seems, been definitely promised his long-sought
bauble. One cable-agency postpones the coveted
degradation until next May 24. If that be so, the
little man is probably running after Her Gracious
with a stethoscope to test her chances of safely
negotiating another birthday. Renwick ought
certainly to have his own carcase sounded, so that,
in case of alarming symptoms, he may be flat-
tened out with the blade of Her Gracious’s sword,
ere the dews of death damp his miserable little
brow. Anyway, across 12,000 miles of water,
Australians hoar the front door of the Colonial
Office bang and click, and the reverberations of a
chorus of—Thank God ! we’ve got rid of him at
last !”
Dear Bulletin,— Why do the papers speak
of the coming “wet season” on Coolgardie?
Possibly in March and October there may be some
atmospherical disturbances, such as are common,
at that period, all over coastal Australia, but these
disturbances may, or may not (probably not),
reach as far inland as Coolgardie. Coolgardie is
on the margin of the great inland area, whereon
the annual rainfall averages sin. and under, which
means a fair chance that no rain may fall for
years. To speak in such a light and airy manner
of “ the wet season,” as though one were speaking
of tropical Queensland, is absurd. The physical
formation of the surface is an everlasting evidence
of the amount of rainfall to be reckoned on with
any reasonable degree of certainty, and that
amount is simply x. The “ wet season ”on Cool-
gardie is all a gamble.
Gladstone was 84 on 29th Dec. Despite
gush over his “unimpaired vigour of mind and
body,” the old man (The Bulletin gets this from
a recent observer) has aged a great deal during
last year. He is grown much thinner—his
form seems shrunken to half what it was
three years ago. His voice, too, is dulled and
husky, and is heard with difficulty at ordinary
times. Only fanatical admirers refuse to admit
that his mental faculties are failing fast. But
(lacking the “commonplace ” wisdom of the truly
sapient sculler, Beach) he will persist in keeping
the field until the very last. Perhaps, however,
this is to his party’s interest, for there is none to
replace him. Gladstone is a magnificent tradition,
but his day for deeds is over. Now, it is cabled
that he is ill, and that the doctors diagnose
tumour.
Now we see the genesis of the Cable
Copyright Bill lately introduced into N.S.W.
A ssembly by Wan t, Q. C., on behalf of certai n people
who control what they call the “ great dailies ” of
Australasia. These gentlemen, with a view of
instituting a monopolistic and comparatively
cheap cable-service, lately combined and agreed
to discontinue one of the rival services in which a
lot of nose-cutting has been done to spite their
own faces. It was to secure to the ring the full
and exclusive benefit of their own messages that
they promoted the bill in question, which bill was
so derisively thrown out of N.S.W. Assembly.
The effect of the measure would have been to
render utterly impossible any effective opposition;
so that, as a matter of fact, the association would
not only have had a monopoly of cable-news,
but also what amounted to a monopoly of the
right of printing daily newspapers. Much to the
chagrin of the big combine, the Australian Star,
Melbourne Herald, and Tasmanian News stood
out, and they have now joined in establishing a
new service, which is working splendidly, and
which last week anticipated the morning paper
services by 12 or 16 hours in a good many im-
portant items. Readers of evening newspapers
have long since been thoroughly sick of the
“daily” paper cable-service, which always con-
veyed the idea that the evening papers had been
cribbing from the morning press. As it is in
the public interest that there should be no news-
paper monopoly The Bulletin is glad to notice
the success of the new service.
“ Labour and Capital will be united when
Labour gets the Capital.”
Death from nail-biting is one of the grue-
some possibilities of this especially lamentable
sphere. Recently, in England, a girl died of an
obscure and unfixable disease, and th o post-mortem
revealed that the cause of death was the accumu-
lation of nail-ends in the intestines.
FOUR HOURS TOO LATE.
“ Oh, God I if I could recall the past three or four
hours. See what trouble a man may bring upon
himself all in a moment .”
Mr. James Curtis and Mr. C. S. Bennett, both
of San Francisco, had been intimate friends for
years. Last summer they quarrelled for the first
time, each accusing the other of wrong. Better
thoughts prevailed and they were reconciled.
But you can’t undo what is once done. Memory
kept the record on her slate. They avoided each
other as much as possible. Still, living as neigh-
bours, men must meet some time. These two met
in the street. The quarrel was renewed. Bitter
words flew fast and thick, and Curtis, beside him-
self with rage, drew his pistol and shot Bennett
dead on the spot. Later in the day he used the
above language—so laden with self-reproach and
sorrow. Yet how useless, how hopeless, how
vain.
But was Curtis right in saying that trouble may
come all in a moment ? True, it often seems so,
but is there not a deeper fact which we don’t see?
It matters nothing what the nature of the trouble
is. Therefore, Jet us consider a different case on
the same principle.
An intelligent woman says:—“ln October,
1890, I had an attack of illness from which I never
expected to recover. I had aching pains all over
me and a cough that nearly shook me to pieces.
I obtained no good sleep night or day, and had to
take to ray bed. I was fed with liquid food from
an invalid’s cup, for I could not raise myself in
bed. My heart fluttered so you could hear it beat
on the pillow, and often pain struck through it as
though somebody had stabbed me. I lay perfectly
helpless and could scarcely breathe. A doctor
attended me over a month, but I grew weaker and
weaker. Sometimes at night I was so bad he
feared I would not live till morning. He called in
a consulting physician and both agreed that my
condition was critical. I was fed with brandy to
keep me alive. My husband and daughter stayed
with me almost constantly. None of the medicines
administered had any effect. I was almost at
death’s door.
“At this time, Mrs. Keeling, of Mutley, near
Plymouth, a friend of mine, urged me to try a
medicine called Mother Seigel’s Curative Syrup.
I procured a bottle, and after a few days I was
able to take and digest sufficient food to give me
some strength, and the worse symptoms were
greatly abated. After having used six bottles of
the Syrup my health was completely restored, and
I have since felt better than for the previous thirty
years. My two daughters have also been cured
of indigestion by it. I will gladly answer any
enquiries.’’
(Signed) Mrs. Louise Jackson, Builders’ Arms
Hotel, Bridge Road, Hammersmith, London,
Jan. 11th, 1892.
In the letter, from which the above is an extract,
Mrs. Jackson further states that for over twenty
years before the attack of October, 1890, she had
suffered from a disordered stomach and liver.
She had a bad taste in the mouth, a poor appetite,
and what little she ate gave her pain. She felt
dull, languid, and tired, and had a miserable
sinking feeling in the stomach, great pain in the
chest and sides, palpitation, giddiness, and fre-
quently fell in the street and had to be assisted
I home.
So we perceive that in her case a cause, long in
operation, at last produced the crisis which came
near ending her life. It is always thus, whether
we recognise the cause or not. The crime com-
mitted by Curtis was the sudden passionate act of
a than who allowed thoughts of hate and vengeance
to take possession of his mind and breed the con-
! dition which made murder possible. In the very
different case of this lady’s illness it was an enemy
; of her body, indigestion and dyspepsia, which at
length broke out into violence.
The lesson is the same. Watch the beginning
of evil and check it while yet it may be easily
controlled.

SPORTING NOTIONS.
The Goddard v. Laing fight was the most
tremendous affair ever known in Melb. So prodigious
was the shouting that people were drawn right from
Bourke-street, fancying a political meeting was on. They
thought it was the Anarchists, but it was only the
Anakim. The crowd jammed out equalled that jammed
in.

It is an odoriferous practice for race-meeting
stewards to adjudicate upon questioned events, in the
results of which they are largely interested, their heavy
wagers being matters of common notoriety. The only
quasi-excuse possible is that the purification of one small
tentacle can’t cleanse the whole sponge saturated with
fraud. _ _

E. Jones, the S. A. fast bowler, has a moustache
almost entirely white on one side ; this, coupled with
sundry patches of white hair, gives the lightning trundler
quite a venerable appearance when viewed from that side.
Jones formerly played for a Broken Hill club, where, on
bumpy asphalt pitches, he laid out nearly as many bats-
men as wickets. At South Broken Hill, the local record
hath it, while bowling in a match, he once sent a bail hi
yards behind the wickets.

It seemed to The Bulletin unfair to give the
high diving championship to Parkinson, at the recent
gala at Lady Robinson’s Beach. Yon Hammer went off
the same height, but it wai given to Parkinson on the
ground that his was the cleanest dive. As well might
a decision be given, where two men swim a dead-
heat, in favour of the man who swims in the best style.
* # #
The high dive is a dangerous game at the best
of times, but it is rendered trebly so at the Beach by the
men taking off from a rioketty, ill-stayed pole.

An outsider would think it would pay the pro-
prietary of a oertai i Sydney pony-course to make a severe
example now and then. It would make the finishes more
exciting and increase speculation.
The playing of “ Billy ” Murdoch with the
N.S.W. team is, no doubt, a trump-card as regards
“ gate." Had it not been for that, the South Australians
would, without doubt, have objected to his playing as a
N.S.W. representative.

Great sport, pony-racing. Lately one punter,
on two occasions, heavily backed a pony, and ‘‘deadened ”
all he thought dangerous. On the first occasion an un-
thought-of one beat his elect, and, in the other, when one
of the stiffened riders tried to get hold of his horse, he
found that some ruffian having greased the reins, he
couldn’t get sufficient hold to keep his mount back.

Strong-man Sandow’s system consists “essen-
tially in the acquirement of perfectly voluntary control
over the various groups of muscles, and, where possible,
of single muscles. By this specialising he was enabled to
localise his muscle-building where it appeared to him to
ba most needed. Having acquired a fair development
and control of the group selected, he then devoted his
attention to another, and so on, until he had succeeded in
acquiring the foundation of the remarkable • general
development which lie nows presents. The only apparatus
used was a pair of five-pound dumb-bells night and morn-
ing."

The cricket-match, N.S. Wales v. South Aus-
tralia, ended on Tuesday with a hollow victory for
N.S.W. by one innings and 153 runs. South Australia
won the toss and went in to make a comparatively feeble
innings of 117 runs. Blinman (26), Lyons (20), Jarvis
and W. Qiffen (13 each), were the only scores
which reached two figures, barring that of an
energetic player called “Sundries,” who made 14.
The day being nearly over and the wicket uncertain,
Moses, the N.S.W. skipper, then judiciously sent in the
tail of his team first, and kept the best men for Monday
morning, when they went in on a reasonably good wicket
and made a brilliant score of 393. Moses (104),
Iredale (64), Callaway and Newell (CO each), supplied
moat of this total. The South Australian men were
apparently demoralised by these figures, and
their second innings only amounted to 118. George
Qiffen, with 35, was top scorer. In the first innings of the
S.A. players Newell took three wickets for 13 runs, and in
the second innings Coningham did most destruction,
taking six wickets. The S.A. bowling broke down badly,
Jarvis’ four wickets for 95 runs being the best record.

Marie Corelli’s latest, “ Barabbas,” is a
queer sort of novel. Judas had a sister named
Judith, mistress of High Priest Caiaphas. Under
Oaiaphas’ influence, Judith persuades Judas that
the betrayal will precipitate the action of Jesus,
in making himself king, and be thus a praise-
worthy act—a view suggested by De Quincey,
When the crashing failure comes, Judith suicides,
as well as Judas. Our parson says the ladies were
first at the sepulchre.
He Stout’s declaration that the minority
must bow to the majority on the liquor-prohibition
question, a jeering elector asked him whether, if
the majority wished it, he would be in favour of
the male population simultaneously omitting to
wear trousers. Stout said certainly, if it could be
shown that trousers did as much harm as whisky.
A/n-o/m, when Jack Hamilton, M.L.A., Aus-
tralia’s champion revolver-shot, was doctoring on
the Palmer rush, and beat all records for getting
over the ground, he habitually concealed his
medical skill under nothing but a shirt and a hat;
and, when it was very hot, he didn’t bother about
the shirt.
The widely-spread rumour that millionaire
M'Calrnont is to marry the Duchess of Marl-
borough has been contradicted by the gentleman.
As there is never smoke without fire it may
turn out that the lucky lady is the mother of
the young Duke of Marlborough—the Marchioness
of Blandford—who divorced her husband, the late
duke. She is a charming woman. M'Cahnont is
a widower. How is it, by-the-bye, that widows
draw so many matrimonial prizes ?
Considering the ghastly mess which
Sydney School of Arts committee has made of the
finances of the institution, they should allow the
appointment of a new secretary to devolve on
their successors, who will be elected in a few
weeks. Of course nobody is responsible. The
auditors, who got a few pounds each annually,
were not supposed to check the accounts, but only
to certify that the secretary’s statement was pro-
perly added up, or something. The whole busi-
ness turns on the same old problem : “ What are
the duties of an auditor? What are the duties of
a board of directors ?”
Judge Richmond (M.L.) was sitting rather
violently the other day on a very small and
crushed-looking bankrupt, for not keeping his
books in proper order, when the broken one’s
lawyer revolted. He gently pointed out that
even his Honor might break suddenly through
unavoidable misfortune, and, supposing he did,
how would his Honor’s books look? His Honor
spent a few seconds in flabbergasted reflection,
and then admitted that his books would probably
look remarkably bad, and after that he dealt a
little more gently with the depressed insolvent.

Two shall be born the whole wide world apart.
And speak in different tongues, and have no thought
Each of the other’s being, and no heed ;
Yet these o’er unknown seas to unknown lands
Shall cross; escaping wreck, defying death,
And all unconsciously shape every act
And bend each wandering step unto this end.
That one day out of darkness they shall meet,
And read life’s meaning in each other’s eyes.
And two shall walk some narrow way of life
So closely side by side, that should one turn
Ever so little space to left or right,
They needs must stand acknowledged face to face ;
Yet these with groping hands that never clasp,
With wistful eyes that never meet, and lips
Calling in vain on ears that never hear,
Shall wander ail their weary day unknown
And die unsatisfied. And this is Fate 1

A S k * lis Saturday’s Argus 12 pages—
A “Lady Complexionist ” now regularly
advertises in the Melb. papers. What is wanted
by Melb. ladies is a “ pedallist.” Freckles can be
disguised, but feet are so obtrusive.
The Northern Territory Times says that
the once-extensive local herds of buffalo are now
all but extinct. Government has been urged to
prohibit further shooting during next season.
The Law, says J udge Hodges, has drawn
certain definitions of libel which are more acade-
mical than practical. The Law’s definitions of
most things are likewise. Practical law would
mean cheap litigation and few lawyers.
The female franchise—a woman’s reason.
At the recent Maoriland general election, a lady
objected to vote for a certain candidate because he
spoke familiarly of her husband as “Jim,” when
conversing with her. His proper name was
Mister.

Welsh miner invariably secures as many sons as
he possibly can, since, with a boy to fill the trucks
for him after he has got out the coal, he can

Dear Bulletin, — He snakes swallowing
their young. While digging the other day 1
turned up a 4in. centipede. It had a nest of
young ones, looking for all the world like grains
of uncooked rice in colour and size, but each had
its legs and other members complete. No sooner

began swallowing the young ones, and in less than
two minutes the whole lot, numbering 18, were
safely tucked away inside. —Yours, Northern
TERRITORY,
The crew of the barque, Spirit of the
Dawn, wrecked on the barren Antipodes Islands,
spent 87 days on that desolate spot before they
were rescued by the Hinernoa, a few weeks ago.
“hey were quite unaware that an ample supply
of provisions had been placed on the island by
the Maoriland Government for the relief of ship-
wrecked people and “planted ” so safely that no one
dropped across them. The profoundly careful
fashion in which these provisions were concealed
was about the most gruesome part of the story.
A man might have starved to death right within
a few feet of them, never dreaming of their
existence.
The Bishop of Chichester (England) re-
cently delivered a lecture on the congenial subject
of Thrift, which lecture has been much approved
by the Tory press. It was garnished with two
anecdotes. One concerned a Sussex labourer
earning 13s. a week, and often less, who, by the
simple process of saving Is. a week, died worth
.£900. He passed away at the age of 72, and left
.£100 to each of his nine children. The other yarn
related to an agricultural labourer who received
16s, a week, while in the flesh—if there ever was
any flesh on him—and died leaving ,£2000, all the
result of rigid economy. The poor old bishop,
guiltless of arithmetic, evidently never
stopped to consider that it would have taken the
first clodhopper something like 200 years, even
allowing for compound interest, to get his .£900
together, and that the other alleged person only
earned £2000 altogether in a full half-century.
Bishops are awful liars.
Nervous sufferers will find it worth their
while to peruse Herr Rassmussen’s advt. on page
17 of this issue.
In his recently-issued Australian novel,
“Out Back,” Kenneth Mackay works in a lot of
very much stereotyped characters including “ the
weary bushranger ’’—for whose appearance he
makes a prefatory apology—but he has carefully
omitted the wattle, the trade-mark of Australian
literature. He would have done much better had
he played a lone hand and left to the English
writers of Australian fiction the traditional char-
acters and incidents which figure in his present
work. The writer of “ Stirrup Jingles ” should be
able to strike new paths and create new actors.
In “ Out Back ” he shows his knowledge of the
true inwardness of Australia and the inhabitants
thereof and his work throughout shows that he
has seen or lived—bushranging excepted—and be-
come letter perfect in the scenery of which he writes.
The plot shows much more cleverness in construc-
tion than skill in presentation, and the last few
chapters give an anyhow and slovenly finish to the
yarn. Kenneth Mackay is a word-artist in
the best sense of the word, but he would
do a lot better if he worked just a trifle more care-
fully.

The Man Who Made the Country.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Of the man who made the country, sing in eulo-
gistic phrases,
His patriot fame must never fade away.
He is fat, and blessed of fortune, and the daily
paper raises
Its voice to do him honour every day. y
He is clad in finest linen and in broadcloth sleek
and sable—
The purple is emblazoned in his phiz—
And he wears a wealth of diamonds and a watch-
chain like a cable—
The man who made the country what it is.
He laments o’er modern movements, like a fine,
old, crusted Tory,
And grieves to see the socialistic drift.
He is used to point a moral and adorn a little
story,
And he poses as a monument of Thrift.
s' , ,
He s the stamp, admirers tell us, of the noblest
nation-makers—
A Trojan in the pioneering fight;
He was here in eighteen-forty, and he grabbed the
fertile acres,
And dummied like a hero left and right. /
Whilst the greed of gain drove others out to delve
for golden gravel
This patriot was faithful to the soil,
And he watched Ins pastures widen and his rest-
less fences travel
O’er lull and dale, encompassing the spoil.
Never toiled he, and he spun not, but he held the
lands, and labour
Was suppliant and grateful to its lord,
And tbe workers in the cities and each sweating
nearer neighbour
Was shorn, like other sheep, to swell his
hoard.
Now he flaunts it on the block, and twenty men
of lowly station
Might live on what he pays away for fizz ;
He’ s an M.L C., a churchman, and a bulwark of
the nation
The man who made the country what it is.
On the great, grey plains the lost wind wanders,
east and westward blowing
The restless dust of dead men fame disowns,
The pioneers who forward to the front were ever
going,
And paving us a pathway with their bones.
And the men who cleft the bush through, and who
hewed the hills asunder,
Who knit the iron thews, and laid the way,
Who o’erthrew the rock-bound mountains, and
who spanned the rivers under,
And set the engines going—where are they ?
Where are they who to the nether hells went down
to beard the devil
And robbed him of his ruddy, boarded gold;
And the men who wrought the roads, and they
who laid the forests level,
And bade the soil its secret gifts unfold ?
Where the sun-browned, bearded swagmen, bred j
on labour and privation, |
By whom the sure foundation here was laid ?
Have we given all the glory to the men who made
the nation,
Or to those bloated men the nation made?
EDWARD DYSON.
The Bulletin’s Missing Word Compe-
tition No. 10 closes on Wednesday, Jan. 24, 1894.
Miss Sutherland, the Melb. philanthropist,
asked why she supported the Knorr reprieve,
said the babies were mostly born half dead.
Two bitterly rival Central Q. newspapers
ordered their Christmas supplements from the
South. Wicked rumour says that one of the pro-
prietors “ got at ” the bagman taking the order to
offer the opposition a certain supplement cheap.
The bait took, and the supplement (duly heralded
by glowing announcements of new and original
stories) was issued. In a paragraph teeming with
irony the up-to-date proprietor pointed out that
his loathsome contemporary was, as usual, some-
what behind the times, “Their Christmas supple-
ment is an exact copy of that issued by this paper
in 1892.”
“F.W.” sends the following indignant
communication:—
Dear Bulletin,— Under the heading, “In a Wet
Season," a most ridiculous article appeared in The Bul-
letin of Dec. 2. I can imagine the perpetrator; he
belongs to that class of journalists who do London or
Paris in a day, and then writes a few columns of insanity
to one of our colonial papers, tending to show how in-
ferior those cities are to Melb. or Sydney. The writer,
evidently, had gone broke in Bourke, and cadged a ticket
to travel on a sheep-train ; als ■, having a bad head and
boiled eyes, the result of (libellous expressions omitted
here), vented his spleen on the country. The “small,
hopeless-looking man ’’ he writes about, very likely earns
more money, honourably, in a week than (first-class libel
cutout.) The population of Byrock never look dismal;
in rainy weather joy is to be seen reflected on every face.
The mean, insulting remarks of H.L. in reference to
swagmen are beneath notice ; should he ever be “on the
road ” and needed help, not one of those men would
refuse to share their last crust with him. The place
“ where there was a rotten, weatherboard pub.” is not to
be found “ along the line.” There is a place where there
are two large, new hotels; one of them is a two-storey
brick building, and would have astonished H.L. had he
been .... to have seen the premises; the horses
seen about the pubs, are strong, well-fed animals; the
men, gathered about the substantial bar, are healthy and
open-handed. Judging from the previous efforts of H.L.
1 had an idea that he was a sort of Australian Bret Ilarte';
but, now, I imagine him an old, weak, vengeful creature
(actionable language reluctantly cut out.)
Before undergoing operative or other
treatment for Piles, consult Mr. A. Sharp on the
new and successful “ Camialin ” treatment, 257
George-st., close to Bridge-st., Sydney.*
Harper’s Bazar is on the track of a new
social trouble, “ facial deshabille :
Does it not seem a thousand pities that more women
are not alive to the positive indecency of appearing at the
breakfast board in what maybe called facial deshabille?
Hardly anyone but considers her morning toilet complete
when she has done with tub and dumb-bells, “fixed”
her hair, and put on her dress ; yet she should never
venture beyond the threshold of her bedroom until she
has coaxed a smooth and smiling reflection into
her looking-glass. To do this we must first “de-
vitalise” the face; that is, cast out the unlovely
expression in possession by encouraging a sen-
sation of droop throughout the features, so that
cheeks, lips, chin and lids may sag heavily while the mind
is, as far,as possible, a blank. After “sozzling” in this
slate of relaxation for a few minutes, let us summon up a
pleasing mental picture, and then allow a little smile, 1
rippling over the face from opening eyes and parting lips,
to gradually bring the fed tires into place and expression.
If one is afflicted with obstinate facial dejection or
asperity, this operation should be repeated several times.
Hterthis, when we hear a dull thud upstairs in
the early morning, we will know it is the landlady
letting her features “ droop ” and devitalising
herself, preparatory to calling up a pleasing ex-
pression with which to come down to breakfast. 1

DOMESTIC ECONOMY!
’ WBCA.T IS IT ?
DOMESTIC ECONOMY is primarily the art of feeding and clothing the family at as low a rate as possible,
'without impairing the family digestion, or taking away the character of its members for being well and com-
fortably dressed. Domestic eoonomy is not comprised in buying a bad article for sixpence when better can be
got for sevenpence ; but if the ruling price for the best is eightpence, and somebody comes along and offers it for
sevenpenoe, then it’s domestic economy to close with the merchant so offering. By all means study this great
and glorious science of social life, because its due and proper observance cannot fail to make poor people rich, and
rich ones richer. What say you ? Will you do your business at

The outline of the proposed United States tariff
is to hand, and the reason why President Cleveland failed
to respond to that historic cablegram from the Free-
-11 aders of Sydney, or why, if he did respond, his reply
was judiciously suppressed, is apparent. The Democratic
tariff bill puts a few—but only a few—raw materials on
iliefree list—and apart from that its general tendency is to
reduce the old 60 per cent, duties to 40 per cent. There-
to e, the Freetrade tariff which the Parkes-Reid party is
<• leering about in the U.S. is, on an average, just three
i linos more protective than the Protectionist tariff which
I ie same party is cursing about in N.S.W. The famous
i-ablegram was all right in itself, but its destination was
wrong. It should have been sent to Dibbs instead of
Cleveland.

The Federal Building Society continues the
Peaceful course of its liquidation under the supervision of
.■■ie old director and the old manager—the third liquidator,
who was also an old director, having resigned. This
custom of entrusting the management under which an
i istitution vra« wrecked with the work of winding it up
seems incurable. In any place but Melbourne the fact
that a certain set of men had run a prosperous concern to
s nash woull he a sufficient reason for getting rid of them
and employing an altogether new crowd, who—if they
did nothing else—might at least give an unbiassed ex-
planation as to what the old crowd had been about; but,
in Melbourne, the old, gone-bung directorate seems to in-
herit the liquidation job as a matter of course.
The Federal Society badly needs re-construction.
During the year it has wiped out some £90,000 worth of
liabilities, and apparently it will be able, in another year
or two, to realise almost all its assets except the great
mass of at present unsaleable land and house-property; and
pay off a good proportion of its deposits. Then it must
either sell the aforesaid property at a loss of about 75 per
cent., or else sit down peacefully and wait until the next
boom enables it to realise ; and pay the big salaries of the
two liquidators—which will gradually eat up the society’s
prospects—while it is waiting. If the society is started
again it should at least earn enough to pay salaries—
which are just about the same in a live institution as in a
dead one ; meanwhile, it earns nothing.
The utter absurdity of the last reconstruction
scheme almost suggests, however, that there is no special
desire to get the Federal Society afloat again. If it does
start once more it should begin with entirely new man-
agement and a new directorate, and nobody related to
James Munro, or any of his friends, in even the fortieth
degree of consanguinity, should be allowed inside the
office door. As a thoroughly serious Scotch Jonah,
Munro has no equal in Australia.

The re-constructed Yic. banks, having bluffed
off their own creditors, are sitting down heavily on the
handful of land-boomers who still survive. This year will
probably' see the veiy l ist boomer of them all put through
the mill for the customary 6d. or so in the £. A year or
so back the banks were disposed to deal tenderly with the
old wrecks, and give them time, and do their best to tide
them over, under the impression that when times grew
better they would rise to renewed wealth and become
valuable customers once more.
But this feeling is now pretty nearly dead.
The boom will come again, no doubt, but when it
does there will be a new generation of boomers, and
the present crowd will mostly be old and greasy
and unshaven and nasally carbuncled, and their frowsy
hair will stick up through their shattered hats, and they
will breathe stale beer at the free-lunch counter while
they swap lies about their vanished greatness. A few in-
domitable spirits will come to the front a second time and
float banks with all their former affability, but, as a general
rule, each boom brings a new crowd to the front, and the
old crowd mostly takes refuge in the Soup Kitchen.
Therefore the banks are seemingly going to sell
the balance of the whited sepulchres for what they will
fetch, and get rid of them. Taking them all round, they
won’t fetch much.
* • m
Queensland’s great experiment of making the
note-issue a State monopoly and abolishing the paper
money of the banks is working well up to date. How
long it will work is a matter of serious doubt. The
Queensland Fat Man Government, with its constitutional
inability to go straight, went crooked on this occasion, as
usual. The whole financial policy of the Government,
no miller what devious track it may take, has always
the Sanaa goal—the interests of the Q.N. Bank ; and even
the seemingly progressive idea of making the currency a
State, instead of a private, monopoly' gets there just the
same. Tne Queensland notes are legal tender throughout
the country, and can be exchanged for gold at the
Treasury, where a 25 per cent, reserve is kept in
sovereigns. But the notes are circulated in a fearful and
wonderful plan. When any bank wants £lOO,OOO worth of
paper it deposits £25,000 in sovereigns with the Govern-
ment and gets it. The remaining £75,000 is credited
to the Government as a deposit on which a nominal
rate of interest is paid.
In case of a panic, the whole .£lOO,OOO in notes
might arrive at the Treasury with a demand for gold.
Therefore, the State would have to find £lOO,OOO in gold at
an instant’s notice, w hereas it had only received one-fourth
of the amount, the other three-fourths being owed to it
by the bank without any security. And though the State
has to pay the whole amount on the instant, it can only
call on the bank to pay in four instalments extending over
nine months.
Therefore, the situation stands thus. A bank
doing a large business, and in straitened circumstances,
might lodge £500,000 in gold at the Treasury and get
£2,000,000 in State notes, which are quite as service-
able. It credits the Government with £1,500,000 as
a deposit, and, consequently, getsa loan of thisamount on
no security. It may be utterly and hopelessly insolvent,
but that makes no difference ; its position is not inquired
into. If there is no national panic and no extensive
demand for gold at the Treasury, it. keeps on owing the
deposit and floating new loans on a similar basis as long
as the bank lasts. And as no bank need break so long as
it can find a sovereign to leave with the Treasury and get
£4 in notes in exchange, it follows that a bank may go on
getting more and more dry-rotted through a long course
of years while showing no outward sign of decay, and
when the smash does come it will be a sure sign that
nothing remains, and that ail the millions owing to the
Government are gone with the rest.
A State note-issue without a State Bank is a
hazardous device. The Queensland system is simply a
scheme whereby any hank which is in difficulties can
stave off trouble by getting the loan from the State
of paper money, for the redemption of which the State is
responsible. And all the security the State possesses is
the right to call for repayment of the loan by four instal-
ments. Which is not so very much more solid than the
right to call on Jabez Balfour to come back from Argentina
and settle up with his victims; or to call on spirits to
arise out of the vasty deep, or the blessed privilege of
calling on bread to drop from heaven, or of going out
into a lonely place and calling generally.

Broken Hill (N.S.W.) Knox says that the price
of silver is regulated privately from day to day in London
by two or three firms who act as brokers and dealers.
“As a matter of fact, three gentlemen, representatives
of very excellent and reputable firms, meet at the office
of one of their number every afternoon, and, after a short
conversation as to the stocks of silver coming forward,
&c., say, ‘ Well, the price to-day shall be so-and-so.’ The
amount decided upon is then written and affixed to a
board, and the thing is done. If there were an open
market we should be able, of course, to sell our silver on
the same terms as govern other transactions, but there is
nothing of the kind.” So that three London gentlemen
actually caused the last Broken Hill strike! Mr. Knox, who
ought to know his way about, declares that he found this
combination too powerful to do much with.

At time of going to press Walsh, Q.C., on
behalf of the Victorian Land Boom Government, was
“considering” the papers in the Mercantile Bank case
and endeavouring to decide whether the case should go
to a jury or not. Apparently, after two years’ hard, con-
sistent thought over the Mercantile case, there is still as
much room for “consideration” as there ever was, and
the question whether there will be any trial after all is
the same absolutely unbiased toss-up as before. The Law
Department is so absolutely unprejudiced that it would
seriously sit down to consider the papers in the case of
Adam without even noticing that the freshness had gone
off the subject a good deal, and that it had got past the
stage where abstract consideration could do it any good.

The latest report of Manager Begelhole, of
Bayley’s Reward claim, reads like a dream of Eldorado.
No. 1 cutting, the site of Bayley’s first discovery: reef
opened up 108 ft. to a depth of 15ft.; stone averaging 7ft.
wide. Raised from this block 650 tons, of which 12 tons
picked stone gave 8500 oz. smelted gold. To further test
value of lode, he sank inclined shaft 80ft. deep; lode
very regular all the way down and Oft. wide. Raised 160
tons in sinking shaft, picked out four tons which gave
1600 oz. gold. At 50ft. opened out drives north and south.
Lode in north drive sft.; 90 tons raised in which gold was
frequently seen; south drive, 90ft., lode 6ft. wide: 250
tons broken out. Five tons, picked, gave 2000 oz. smelted
gold. Over back of this drive he has sloped a small piece
of ground for 70 tons ; picked out 2 jtons for 900 oz. So
much for No. 1 cutting.
No. 2 cutting is not so rich. It is 100 ft. nort^ l
■of No. 1 and opened out 50ft. long and 15ft. deep. Lod e
Bft. wide ; 200 tons broken, four tons picked for IOOOoz-
Shaft going down in floor of cutting: present depth, 32ft.,
showing rich stone all the way. Sixty tons raised; 35cwt.
picked stone gave SOOoz. Stone in bottom very rich,
and heavy yields expected here; hence shaft is being
■carried down to 100 ft. ere opening out.
Mr. Begelhole continues his dream-like report.
In lease 180, bought and added to the Reward mine, a
cutting has been made 60ft. long, eight feet deep, lode
eight feet tliick, shaft, sunk in the cutting, 70ft. deep ;
raised SOOoz. from 25cwt. picked stone. About 300 ft.
north of shaft he has put a cut across lode, which is there
20ft. wide but comparatively poor. After referring to
the gold-bearing character of another reef, known as the
Western, from which 100 tons has been broken, the
manager proceeds to deal with ore reserves.
About 1700 tons have been broken from the
different workings, which the manager estimates to go at
least 6 ozs. per ton. Then there are 100 tons wash-dirt
cut from surface in dam-making; prospects equal to
2 ozs. Also, 600 tons of surface, which seems to be the
overflow from the lode, “and which is so rich in gold that
ozs. can sometimes be picked out of it in a few minutes.
Recent tests have proved the value to be over 10oz. per ton.
You will note we have at grass to-day, ready for the
battery, 2500 tons, which 1 estimate to yield over 16,000
ozs.”
“Going below, we have the rich block of
ground between the floors of No. 1 cutting and the back
of the south drive from the 50ft. level. This block is 30ft.
high, and will, without doubt, be quite as rich as any-
thing either in driving or cutting. The block contains
1200 tons, and, as the stone both over and under has
yielded 18oz. per ton, I think we are justified in assuming
the block will maintain the same average, which would
mean a total of 21,0000 z. At No. 2 cutting we have below
the floor 300 tons in sight, worth 17oz. per ton. So that,
in round numbers, we may say there are 40,0000 z. in
sight down to the 50ft. level only. The incline shaft is
down 30ft. below that, and as the stone is quite as good
in the bottom of the drive as that now showing in the
back, I am of opinion that when the 100 ft. level is reached
we will open up another 50ft. block equal in richness to
the one now in work. There is also a very large quantity
of payable stone in sight on XBO lease and on the western
reef."
Was there ever such a mine as that sold for
£6000! The writer met Mr. Gorrie, the original owner of
Bayley’s Reward South, a few days ago. Gorrie is a
practical miner, and was asked to point out where in his
report manager Begelhole had exaggerated. He replied:
“There is no exaggeration. I have seen the mine and
know the man, and I can say that he has under-estimated
a good deal. For instance, he reckons the Western reef
at 2ozs. per ton ; while I know it will go fully saz. We
have opened the reef up in the South mine, and from
numerous prospects taken from the reef in both properties
I am certain it will go what 1 say.”

Items from the report on the Murchison reefs
by a man who has been on most Australian fields:—“ln
six months Daly and party have dollied 1600 oz.; about
same quantity has been taken out of next claim. Austin
Island, considering its size, is the richest spot yet dis-
covered in W. A. The first reef on the Island was found
by Lawrence and Mooney who dollied out 600 oz. In the
next claim Regan and party say they dollied about 6000 oz.
in 18 months. I saiw one parcel of stone in Pearce’s claim
out of which SOOOok. have been taken. When I left they
were also dollying stone from the Goloonda and expected
to get IOOOoz. in a week. The Evening Star claim is
phenomenally rich, and already SOOOoz. have been dollied.
On the whole, I don’t hesitate the opinion that the Mur-
ohison will prove a successful rival to Ooolgardie.’ If so,
we ought to hear ten times as much about it.

The trend of affairs in Block 10 mine is shown

silver ; Block 14. 935,820 ozs. ; no other mine got over the
half million. The yield is a record one. In ’9l it was
15,650,000 ozs. ; in ’92 (strike year) 13,550,(00 ozs.
Relatively small quantities of copper and gold were
recovered as by-products.

Reported that on the Wadham lease a reef
has been hit 40ft. down, believed to be the richest dis-
covered at Murchison, and to vie with Bayley's. There
is no idea yet of the size of the body of stone, but its
richness is apparent from the specimens, in which the
gold is simply held together by the quartz. Thirteen
batteries or mills are either in full swing, in course of
erection, or are on the way to the Murchison.

The Macquarie groans at the
New Year’s look-out. The publicans in one town-
ship there, a few days before Xmas, petitioned
the police to clear the river-banks of travellers,
lest the latter should meander up in force for the
usual free Xmas dinner. A squatter on the river
has shifted his “travellers’ hut” to a place sur-
rounded by five or six ant-beds, populated with
the “meat-ant.” A station-hand fell off a dray
and got killed. Next day, 16 men crowded up to
the station with one burden—“ Any chance of a
job, boss?” “No, full up.” “How's that?
Wasn’t there a bloke killed here yesterday ?”
Bathurst burrs are scarce on the Macquarie this
year, which is the greatest calamity of all for
travellers.

That dreary moral reflection “ murder
will out ” has seen its best days. In the ten years
ending 1886 there were 1766 known murders in
England and Wales, and 1094 of them have never
been cleared up to this day, nor has any trace of the
murderer been found. When allowance is made
for all the unknown murders—those where the
body itself is never discovered, and the matter is
merely set down as a mysterious disappearance,
and for all the murders which are successfully
covered by medical certificates, and those which
pass as suicide or death by accident, and those
shady cases where the body is buried without any
medical certificate at all—in one county, 42 per
cent, of the deaths are not verified by any doctor,
and the deceased may have his head cut off, or
have 21b. of strychnine in him for all the law
knows to the contrary—it is probable that only
one British murderer in ten is ever found.
WHAT CURES PIMPLES
l/
The only really successful prevent-
ive and cure of pimples, blotches,
blackheads, red, rough, and oily skin,
and most complexional disfigurations,
is that greatest of all Skin Purifiers
and Beautifiers, the celebrated Cuti-
CURA Soap. For irritating and scaly
humors of the scalp, with dry or fall-
ing hair, red, rough hands, chaps,
painful finger ends with shapeless
nails, and simple humors of the skin
and scalp of infancy and childhood, it
is simply infallible.
CUTICURA SOAP
A marvellous beautifier of world-wide celebrity, CUTICURA Soap is simply incom-
parable as a Skin-Purifying Soap, unequalled for the Toilet, and without a rival for
the Nursery. Absolutely pure, delicately medicated, exquisitely perfumed, it produces
the whitest, clearest skin, and softest hands, and prevents inflammation and clogging
of the pores, the cause of pimples, blotches, blackheads, red and oily skin, and most
complexional disfigurations. It derives its remarkable medicinal properties from
Cuticura, the great skin cure, but so delicately are they blended with the purest of
toilet and nursery soap stocks that the result is a medicated toilet soap incomparably
superior to all other skin and complexion soaps, while rivalling in delicacy and sur-
passing in purity the most noted and expensive of toilet and nursery soaps. For the
prevention of facial blemishes, for giving a brilliancy and freshness to the com-
plexion, and for cleansing the scalp and invigorating the hair, it is without a peer.
Sale greater than the combined sales of all other skin soaps. Sold everywhere. 25c.
Skins on Fire

A Lamb to the Slaughter i A Story of
Bornco.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Sabi wanted a head. That wasn’t much.
Dyak girls often did want a head from their
suitors. But Sabi was a belle—her father was
worth' many brass cannon* —and the head Sabi
vvanted was a white man’s !
Now, white men were scarce in the south-west,
and their heads were dangerous to get—single-
handed. So Achang chewed betel over the pro-
blem for a full hour, and then, being a man of
action, took his weapons and went over to Panda
the blacksmith.
Panda was a Kayan—despised as a man, but
mightily respected as a sword-maker. Also, he
could put two and two together. The price of
Sabi’s hand he knew, and knew, too, who was the
only one of her half-hundred admirers likely to
pay it. So when he saw the silk surong and the
leopard-skin jacket his fish-like mouth twisted
knowingly up towards his overloaded ear.
Silently he received the Dyak dandy’s swords.
Kris and ihlang he put aside, then took up the
latok.
“This wants no help from me,” he said.
“Never was a better edge!” and then, with his
eye on Achang’s, he made a lightning sweep with
the sword, and stooped as if to pick up with his
left hand some object from the ground. The
blood-lust flashed into Achang’s inky eyes, and
the muscles stiffened up under his saddle-coloured
skin, as. for an answer, he rubbed his hand rapidly
over his cheek and chin.
Panda understood. A beard ! —and therefore a
white man.
“ Good !” he said. “ Thou climbest high. Is it
Stobsi whose neck is to melt ?—Stobsi, the stick-
hunter ?”
“No ! thou Kayan pig ! Stobsi is as one of our
own people. I would myself take his head who
would take Stobsi’s ! Besides, fool, hath Stobsi a
beard ? Scrapeth he not his face every day with
a little parang till it is smooth as a shark’s belly ?”
Now Stubbs, the “stick-hunter,” was not loved
of Panda. The blacksmith, like many a Kayan,
dispensed with a waistcloth because he had a pair
of drawers tattooed upon his dingy hide—at which
thing the little cockney had laughed hugely. But
to laugh at a Kayan is to make a deadly enemy,
and Panda was ingenuously sorry that Stubbs’
was not the head to fall. Now, too, that Achang
had called him a pig, he had to get level also with
that turmeric-tinted warrior, and as he blew
sullenly at his charcoal he saw how.
“ If it isn’t Stobsi,” he told himself, “it must
be Bekkul; no other white men within twelve
days’ journey.” And Bekkul —otherwise Beck-
ley—had a fast friend in Kamsut, the Tuan of
Rubianak.
Panda dropped his bellows and brought out a
jar of tuak. Only at set feasts do the Dyaks, as a
rule, get drunk. Still, there are exceptions, and
Achang was one of them ; so the evil-smelling
stuff, having gone liberally down his throat, got
duly up into his head. Then he babbled, and
Panda lay low for him. Bekkul was to be the
victim, and Achang, with drunken circumstanti-
ality, set forth his plan of operations. Then, as
tuak-drinkers will, he fell incontinently fast
asleep, whereupon Panda, girding up his loins
with an unwonted waistclout, slipped unostenta-
tiously into the jungle and started eastwards.
# • •
To Beckley, two days later, there sud-
denly appeared, as the result of Panda’s little
excursion, the Tuan of "Rubianak himself, with a
tail of 50 Malays and one unwilling Chinaman.
“ Ask no questions, Bekkul, my father,” said
Kamsut. “Change now thy garments and give
to these men those thou wearest.”
Beckley, who knew his man, obeyed without a
word, and wondered much to see his clothes placed
upon the no less astonished Chow. The Tuan took
out one of his watches —he wore three ! —then
looked at the sinking sun.
“At dusk of every evening, Bekkul, thou
drawest water by the reed-bed yonder; but to-
night goeth down this yellow dog in thy stead.
Why—thou shaltin due time understand ! ”
Down went the sun, and down went Sun Ling
to the water, in Beckley’s rig, and with Beckley’s
jars. At the margin of the reedy wall he put
down his vessels, and was stooping to admire the
reproduction of his yellow phiz, surmounted by
Beckley’s topee, when the reeds parted gently be-
side him, and, plunge!—reflection and reflected
came suddenly together, as Sun Ling’s shaven
sconce swept clean from his shoulders —flopped
sullenly into the green-black water ! The slayer
threw down his parang, dropped a knee upon the
red-spouting neck, and picked out of the water
the still fatuously grinning head. Then, as he
stood astounded, came running from the hut the
Tuan’s men, spreading out to cut him off.
Achang looked, snatched up his parang, threw
it down again, and bounded far into the darkening
river.
With fifty strokes he bottomed on the further
side and turned to see how many followed him.
Not one !—for now from beneath the hollow bank
behind him there stole swiftly out a mighty ripple
and a long, grey snout came towards the wader
with a rush. There was a shriek that soared to
wing again a cloud of roosting copper-birds ; then
Achang’s brass-ringed ankles flourished for a
second in the air as his body was crushed! in the
five-foot jaws that took him under like a frog.

Retrenchment.
[FOR THE BULLETIN].
Tis a time of deep depression, there’s retrench-
ment in the air ;
There’s a cutting-down of prices and of wages
everywhere;
There’s a turning of old garments, and a patching
of old pants,
And a tendency to cotton to one’s wealthy maiden
aunts.
People say that we began it, bub we really needn’t
mind,
For it isn’t to this planet that the trouble is con-
fined :
It’s a kind of epidemic, and, I’ve recently been
told,
They’re retrenching up in Heaven, and econo-
mising gold.
Even there the horrid poison the celestial ether
taints;
They are cutting up old rainbows into haloes for
the saints;
The harps which once were golden are nob golden
any more,
And they’re serving out tin-whistles to the angels
by the score.
The pearly gates have vanished, and a pearl you
never see;
And amethysts are scarcer there than lawyers
used to be.
The cherubim are wearing leather slippers on
their feet,
And they’re substituting metal for the gold upon
the street.
There’s Saint Peter in a fury, for they’ve got his
golden key—
He nearly used an adjective commencing with a
“D”-
He fastens up the portals, and it goes against his
grain,
With a common kind of padlock and an ordinary
chain.
Then there’s Abraham, and Moses, and the ancient
Jewish lot —
Well, they’ve got a little “ corner,” and intend to
make a “ pot.”
The Hebrew kings, who used to frighten subjects
with their frowns,
Are “ advancing ” to the seraphs on the jewels in
their crowns!
It’s an awful kind of crisis, and a pretty state of
things,
When an impecunious cherub has to pop his harp
and wings,
But it’s worse when weary angels can’t sit down and
rest their bones
’Gos a “ring ” of Hebrew prophets has a lien upon
their thrones.
What is looming in the future ? What is coming ?
Who can tell
That the trouble’s not extending to the other
place as well T
Don’t imagine, gentle reader, that you’ll find it,
when you go,
Any better, one iota, in the regions down below.
’Cos it’s rather more than likely, I imagine, on
the whole,
They’re retrenching there in sulphur, and econo-
mising coal;
Instead of grilling pleasantly, in privacy and
ease,
You may have to share a gridiron with a lot of
C.M.G.’s.

The “ Disciples of Christ ” are sending from Mel*
bourne a missionary to the New Australia colony
in Paraguay. The members of the sect believe
that “ without baptism by immersion there is not

urgent bush-clearing operations by laying this
view of the matter before the New Australians at
full length.
Oolemane & Sons’ Eucalypte Pills stir one up.
A story is going round the Australian
papers—and has been going round for some weeks
—concerning a beautiful Irish boy who lately
suicided in Dublin. The tale is partly a new
version of the Boy who stood on the Burning Deck
and partly a horrid parody on “Little Jim.”
This awful youth—aged 12—was of a wealthy
family, but his parents became so much reduced
in circumstances that he and his father and
mother and his four little brothers and sisters had
to live in one small room, which ws,s also occupied
by three other families. If the, three other
families were of the same size, this makes nearly
30 people inhabiting that one small room, and if
any of the families took in boarders that would
further aggravate the evil. This looks pretty
“steep”—but, no matter. Then the 12-year-old
son of this reduced family resolved to sacrifice
himself for the good of his parents. He scraped
up 4s. and spent it in the purchase of various
comic papers and other things which have
coupons attached guaranteeing payment of large
amounts if a person is found dead with the goods
in his possession. He got together coupons to the
amount of £3500, and then he left a pathetic letter
for his mother—and drowned himself, so that she
might get the money. And—here the full horror
of the tale comes in—the name of this small boy
was “Ferdinand de Freyne de Courcy.”
He signed it in full at the end of the pathetic
letter which he left for his mother. That name
and the story of the four families that lived in
one small room ought to break the narrative up,
but the dunderheaded Australian dailies keep on
publishing it in all seriousness, and probably won’t
begin to see the joke until it further transpires
that the name of one of the other three families
was Hernando Oaulainoourt Rohan Gonzales de
Montmorency von Alvenaleben. Then it will
gradually dawn on them that there is something
wrong. How the Irish gentleman who wrote that
paragraph must grin !

Pastor Fitchett, in Southern Cross, asks
why the newspaper gives a column to a circus,
patronised by 1000 people, and only 20 lines to a
religious meeting attended by 2000 people. The
reason is because the religious world doesn’t pay
for news, but cribs all the godly papers in the
Athenaeums, so that the Southern Cross has to
appeal with piteous whines.
Dear Bulletin, — I found the following in
a recent paper :
The most urgently-needed reform in Australia is the
abolition of the British black suit and the British black
top hat. The hat never served any useful purpose ; it is
hard, ungainly, and as difficult to carry about as the
remains of a murdered relative. As for the suit it is as
unsuited to the climate as a vest of chain armour with a
gridiron helmet. For eight months in the year white
cotton or linen is the only fitting wear in Australia.
I wish to object to this; the statements look
feasible, but even the cool white linen suit has its
disadvantages. I owned one for about a month
and found it the most disastrous outfit on record.
The trouble began in a very far north Queensland
town—a sweltering, ant-eaten, ghost-haunted,
snake-infested settlement, balanced on the outer
rim of perdition. An unemployed pressman came
to this town one day, and the proprietor of a small
monthly publication hired him aseditor, sub-editor,
reporter, manager, collector, horse-power and
general rouseabout. His engagement was short and
troubled. He went amissing the first day, and
the third day he was found drunk by the side of a
lagoon with a swelled head and a great deficiency
in his cash. His proprietor shook him up, and
in emphatic language gave him 24 hours to square
his accounts, whereupon he ran back to the town
in affright, gathered up as much of his baggage as
he could carry, gave the rest of his clothes to a
friend for safe-keeping lest they should be seized
in settlement of his hotel-bill, and then fell on
board the steamer and was seen in these parts no
more.
Then the friend, being of a treacherous turn,
proceeded to realise upon the clothes and drink
the proceeds, and among other transactions he
sold me a linen suit and cork helmet, taking a
sapphire scarf-pin in exchange. (I was also
leaving the town, by the way). There was a great
orgie up there in those days, and when he had
drunk most of the clothes and was just getting
through the umbrella and an overcoat he lost his
billet through trying to walk a chalk-line in the
office and betting six drinks that he could
throw a quantity of ink into the editor’s eye
through the keyhole. Finally, on the day of my
departure, he endeavoured to pawn the sapphire
pin, and discovered that it was glass. He
demanded restitution, and, not getting it, he fol-
lowed me down to the wharf, and there addressed
the town generally concerning my character.
Then, a bright idea occurring to his corrupted
intelligence, he ran back to the town and informed
my tailor and a few other disinterested friends
and creditors of my departure. They all streamed
down to the steamer, where they arrived too late
to interview me, but just in time to telegraph to
have me intercepted at the next port, where I
only escaped by concealing myself among the
coals. Finally, I reached Melbourne in safety,
and almost the first man I met was the original
owner of the linen suit and the cork helmet. He
demanded their return, with the alternative of
legal proceedings, and, under the circumstances, I
surrendered them. I have loathed the sight of
anything even distantly resembling them ever
since.—Yours, Titus Salt.
An Old Man’s Darling.
[FOR THE BULLETIN].
The skipper of the Mahina was such »
dear old man. Bright, English-red face, merrily-
laughing eyes of deepest blue, enshrined in a mop
of silvery-white hair ; age of body perhaps 65, of
heart 20 summers. He came to Apia from Hono-
lulu to try and sell a cargo of Puget Sound lumber,
aecordeons, and J.D.K.Z. gin.
• » •
A religious storekeeper brought him to tho
little Mission Church on the bank of the Vasigago,
one Sunday. The women looked with pleasant
smiles at the burly figure of the gay-hearted old
mariner ; the men with intense admiration at the
pretty girl who nestled beside him—his wife, a
native of the Hawaiian Islands. Such a lovely
little straight nose, soft, kissable mouth, and dark,
melting eyes. He looked like a Christianised
double of roving Bully Hayes; she likd an
equatorial Madonna with fluffy hair and grey kid
gloves.
# * •
“ How sweetly happy she looks!” sighfully
said a pretty white lady. “ I’m sure he must be a
loveable old man.” (Yet she had a husband, and
plenty of servants—just as pretty as the old cap-
tain’s wife). N.B.—lt’s the custom for married
white women to sigh in Polynesia. However, she
took the Hawaiian angel home to dinner.

At ten next morning the Mahina hove
short waiting for the captain to come aboard. He
came—joyously drunk. “Heave up, Growler!”
he said to the mate.”
“But Niaisn’t aboard, sir.”
“Look here, Growler” (with dignity), “you—
just—do—(hie)—as—l—tell—you. My wife’s all
right. Spent the eveningsh with Mr. and Mrs.
—. Promished be aboard ten sharp. Isn’t
here. If she ain’t aboard before we—(hie)—get
out o’ the passhage she’ll have to wait in Samoa
till I come back. Get the ship out o’ this—(hie) —
Growler. I must go and lay down a bit.”
“All right, sir. But here’s Mr. ’s boat
coming off now. Shall I heave her to outside?”
“Who else is in the boat ? ”
“Only Mr. ——.”
“Ah!”
* # *
“It’s no use, Nia, we can’t catch her,”
said the Hawaiian angel’s companion. “He must
be drunk. And you’ll get wet through, pet.”
He slewed the boat round, the crew set the sail,
and headed for the shore.
* # *
Mrs. promised to treat her like a
sister.
# * #
A few months afterwards Mr. got
a letter from the good old man :
San Francisco, June 10, 188-. Dear . Sorry I
couldn’t wait—breeze too stiff and I was drunk. Nia
would have been mad. She has my watch. Please send
ic me by Oppermann, of the Montiaro ;he knows me. I
won’t come back to Apia ; I lost money over that timber.
Nia is all right. I told Oppermann about her, so if she
wants to get back to Oahu you can take her to him.
Copra has gone down $7 a ton here. Tell Nia I hope she
didn’t get wet.—Yours fraternally, Thomas .
